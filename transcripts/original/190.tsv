0	5000	From Hollywood, California, Harman Town is now in session.
5000	10000	Let's bring out Spencer Christensen, shall we?
10000	15000	There's me, boy.
15000	20000	And the mayor of Harman Town, yeah, Harman.
20000	27000	Thank you very much.
28000	31000	Thank you very much.
31000	34000	Oh, all right.
34000	35000	It's a good song.
35000	37000	Yeah.
37000	41000	I mean, you know, he's outnumbered in hating me.
41000	45000	You know, people like me.
45000	47000	And they like working with me.
47000	50000	Happy Easter, thank you for coming on a holiday.
50000	52000	You got a little scratchy throat?
52000	58000	Yeah, that's why I'm excited that we have, like, a gigantic abundance of guests tonight.
58000	60000	Do we have too much show?
60000	63000	I think it's perfectly balancing.
63000	68000	I've been, I just, it's all, like, it's meetings all week.
68000	70000	And, like, I just, I'm always talking.
70000	71000	My job is always talking.
71000	75000	Like, I'm not, I never get to, like, go, okay, good meeting, guys.
75000	79000	And then just start, like, operating a jackhammer.
79000	82000	And just thinking about it.
82000	84000	That meeting was crazy.
84000	87000	My whole life is just meetings and talking now.
87000	89000	Talking about writing.
89000	91000	Like, rarely writing.
91000	95000	And even when I am writing, I'm talking about what I'm writing because I'm writing with other people.
95000	97000	And I'm going, like, well, this should be written like this.
97000	99000	Well, this should be written like this.
99000	101000	Well, you're a piece of shit.
101000	103000	Sorry.
103000	107000	And then all weekends I'm shooting this history thing, Great Minds.
107000	109000	And we worked with Nick Kroll today.
109000	110000	Oh, yeah.
110000	111000	It was amazing.
111000	115000	I just watched the Thomas Middle, the Shakespeare thing one.
115000	118000	I was so happy you guys shot it at the tin horn flats.
118000	119000	Yeah.
119000	120000	That's a great little bar.
120000	121000	Yeah.
121000	122000	Very funny.
122000	125000	Yeah, we've been very, I mean, we have, it's called Great Minds.
125000	131000	And we have, it's been like a real, like, squad goals kind of, like, just convention for me.
131000	136000	Everybody that I've ever wanted to, like, just meet or work with is, like, coming through.
136000	140000	Yesterday was Kristin Schall as Amelia Earhart.
140000	150000	She's, like, regardless of on screen, Kristin Schall is, like, and I asked around after she left the set.
150000	152000	And I almost wanted to ask her, but I'm kind of a stranger to her.
152000	153000	So I thought it'd be a weird question.
153000	156000	I wanted to ask, are you in a really good mood today?
156000	158000	Or are you always like this?
158000	162000	She's just, like, a totally chill, delightful person.
162000	167000	And then I had, Schwab had worked with her and was like, yeah, no, she's exactly like that all the time.
167000	172000	I was having a sandwich at a place today and the, the, the, the.
172000	176000	Jeff, how can you pretend that's related?
176000	177000	That's just what Jeff does.
177000	178000	He always forces.
178000	181000	The bartender, the waiter.
181000	186000	I'm name dropping and you're always forcing your ordinary world experiences.
186000	188000	The waiter walked up.
188000	196000	The waiter walked up to the bartender and said, that girl from Flight of the Conchords, that girl from Flight of the Conchords.
196000	197000	And I knew who they met.
197000	200000	So, like, she came in today and she was the coolest person in the world.
200000	204000	Like, like, she, she was just sprinkling stardust around our neighborhood.
204000	205000	I'm telling you, I don't want to.
205000	208000	That's how I spread my fucking common day bullshit around.
208000	212000	I don't want to cause trouble for her in her personal life.
212000	217000	But like, like, like, like by making people go, oh, I'm going to seek her out and stalk her.
217000	221000	I just like, she is truly, she's like a human air freshener.
221000	227000	I have walked onto planes where I've overheard flight attendants say,
227000	231000	Kristen Shaw was on the plane earlier and she was like, made everybody so happy.
231000	237000	We flew 500 feet higher and used less gas.
238000	242000	We got there so early that there was no gate for us to land at.
242000	244000	They had to build it.
244000	253000	We arrived at the US Memorial Airport, found out we had died of happiness in the past, which was the present.
253000	260000	Dan Spencer, like, people, if you work in the industry long enough, you'll meet people and you'll hear good stories about people, bad stories.
260000	264000	There are certain people that people have negative things to say about, positive things.
264000	269000	Nobody so far has ever said anything negative about Kristen Shaw, as far as I've ever heard.
269000	273000	There's a bunch of, you know, I mean, I wouldn't want, that's not as rare a thing.
273000	279000	It's like, there's, there's menches in the world, like, like Will Ferrell and I mean, Nick Kroll, who we worked with today.
279000	282000	Like, like, like, I don't, I don't, I never heard a Nick Kroll's a dick story.
282000	287000	That guy is like, I told him today because I was like, thank you so much for doing the show.
287000	293000	Like, like he just came in and I don't want to say took over in a, that makes, makes it sound like he was telling people to do.
293000	296000	He just, it was just easier to just let him go.
296000	302000	He was like a pole string doll that you pull and he just like acts all over the place. It's amazing.
302000	311000	I, I told him, I said, not, not that it's a competition, but I said, I said, Nick Kroll, you are like a tornado that builds houses.
311000	316000	Yeah, because he made a, she made our TV show for us.
316000	323000	Yeah, we just let ours be torn down and like there was a better one erected as he, as he whooshed through.
323000	325000	It was amazing.
325000	328000	Whatever, whatever. Famous people are great.
328000	330000	No, they're not great.
330000	335000	The one exception is you've been lucky. The point is that you're getting to work with the coolest people in the world.
335000	337000	There are dicks. There's like, there's Rob Cordry.
337000	340000	You know, that guy.
340000	345000	I'm so glad I wasn't here for that show. He sounded like, he sounded like such a tool.
345000	350000	I know. I fucking bit my lip because it's like, you're such a dick.
350000	354000	You issued a lot of restraint and I thought that was very good of you.
354000	360000	I know. What are you going to do? I have an obligation to the crowd. I want to put on a good show so I don't want them to feel the tension, but it's like.
360000	361000	Rob Shrab to me. Come on.
361000	366000	Yeah. No, these guys are racist, sexist.
366000	373000	Do you think of any corollary to their being named Rob and being bald at the same time that makes them the same version of bad people?
373000	381000	I don't know. Well, I don't have anything. I mean, yeah, well, we have a lot of guests, so why don't we start bringing them out?
381000	390000	Please welcome, fresh off of their two man show tour on off Broadway, Rob Shrab and Cordry are here.
390000	393000	Rob Shrab and Cordry.
403000	413000	We already have too much show. This is already more of a show.
413000	419000	I'm just going to give you the poll position here. You've earned it. No. I feel like you've earned it.
419000	426000	Rob Cordry. I don't feel like I deserve this. Rob Cordry. Yeah. May I address you please? Go ahead.
426000	433000	I was out of town last show. Yeah. I listened to it. It made me so happy that you are such a big fan of the show.
433000	441000	Yeah. Like you love your Dave Clines. You were sad. You were sad and I totally wasn't here. I was. Is he here?
441000	450000	I think he's moved on. He's blowing it. The turnover rate is high, you know. Really? Dave Cline will stop yooping soon.
450000	455000	Adam Goldberg's probably not here. Nope. Nope.
455000	462000	We're catching these kids in a turbulent time of their life. Yeah. Yeah. There's no Charles Grodin's in the audience.
462000	470000	They're just like, I love your show. I'm going to be here for 35 years. But Jeff, I was really upset that you weren't here.
470000	477000	I mean, Trump was a great comptroller. I did pretty good. He's a great comptroller, especially when his parents are here.
477000	487000	Oh, yeah. Because he's the least shroppy. Yeah. That episode with David. Who's your dad's name?
487000	496000	David. Dave. Dave. Dave. David. David. David and Donna, right? David and Donna. Yes.
496000	501000	The episode with your parents on was really magical. I thought that was really lovely.
501000	510000	Well, because that's what controls him. Bringing Shrobs parents on stage is like picking up a feral cat by the scruff of the neck.
510000	523000	Shrobs just went limp. He was just shaking his head the whole time. Just be careful. Be careful.
523000	530000	So you guys, you know, I mean, yeah, man, it's great. Yeah. Yeah, man. Lay it on it. Lay it on it.
530000	539000	Shropping it now. Lay it on. Full on Shrobs. Give it. Give it to us, man. Yeah. You're getting the double shrub right now.
540000	559000	Yeah, man. Yeah, man. Oh, shit. Yeah. Oh, shit. Oh, oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, give me a red cup. Give it to me. Give me a red cup. Give me a red cup.
559000	572000	Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Rob Cordry. Oh, shit. Rob Cordry, how do you feel about chips? Oh, chips. Oh, chips. Oh, shit. They're good, right?
572000	582000	Chips are good. Chips are great. Oh, chips. So you guys are just, you're just finishing a first successful run of your off-Broadway two-man show. Yeah.
583000	597000	Double the Robs. Yeah. Too many Robs. Yeah. Right. There's a lot of subtitles. Yeah. Double the Robs. Too many Robs. Rob Robs.
597000	603000	I hate, I hate, I hate doing this to you guys without warning, but is there like a, is there like a scene from it or a part of a show?
603000	617000	Oh, gosh. Should we do, which one? Spaghetti scene? Spaghetti scene. Spaghetti scene. Yeah. This gets pretty fucked up. That's the one I read about in Esquire. This gets pretty fucked up. Okay.
617000	628000	Okay. This is too, this is too many Robs. Right. What act, what scene are we in right now? This is like 2A. Spaghetti. 2A? 2A. Alright.
628000	644000	And in my hand I have, just to set, set the scene, I have, we've been talking, he's been asking for a plate of spaghetti for a long time and I have a, finally bring out the plate of spaghetti and, and it's a bowl.
645000	663000	I thought I had one. Fuck you. Fuck you. This is clearly a bowl. It is not a plate. Fuck. A plate of spaghetti please. Send it back to the kitchen immediately. Immediately.
663000	692000	And then, and then there's a whole scene. There's a whole, we have a whole kitchen. Oh yeah. You play the, yeah, yeah. Dan will play the kitchen staff. Is this 2B or 2C? Where are we in that? Okay. Well then, 2C? It's hard to explain. Yeah, yeah. It's a two-man show, but there's actually nine to ten, nine to ten people that help us out. Like six, six of them are attractive young women that help hip hop interstitials. All dressed in black. Right. Yeah. So we're in the kitchen now.
692000	721000	He wants a plate. He can have the plate if he don't pay. You haven't seen the show. But, but whatever. We'll just, we'll just, we'll skip to the third act. Yeah, we'll deal with this. Fuck it up, you fucked it up. You fucked it up. Alright, we'll skip to the third act. Okay, okay, great. Oh. Oh. This is a plate because my hand is straight. Rob, thank you so much.
721000	750000	Thank you so much for this plate that you gave me. Take it. I'm trying. Take it. I'm trying, but my... Take it. I'm gonna drop my hand. Okay, okay. You have to take the weight of the plate. One, two, three. And then... And the plate was stuck to my hand. Yeah, it's stuck to his hand. And, and, and it's... This show has run for five years. Yeah. Off, off, off Broadway. Yeah.
751000	779000	It's presented as if that's a magic trick when I saw the show and I did see it. Right. And in my defense, Tim Conway was playing the part I was doing. Right. He was the understudy. Right. So maybe I laid it on too thick for you, but... Yeah. It's not a good show. The, the thing is that you present the plate stuck to the hand as if it's like a magical thing. Yeah. But that scene comes after 20 minutes of those six girls dancing. Right. That's plenty of time to glue a plate to your hand. Yeah, but, but as you, but we...
779000	808000	But we didn't use any glue. No. Yeah. It's, it's actually... It's enough time to make a special plate with a hand strap on it. But, but we didn't do that. We have a whole thing. Well, like we don't, we're not miming spaghetti like we're doing now. We're using real spaghetti. It's enough time, enough time passes that you could go... But we didn't, but Dan, we didn't do that. Yeah. We didn't do that. You don't get it. We didn't use a strap. We didn't use a glue. We just had a plate and it was stuck on my hand. Right.
809000	838000	We didn't do anything that you see. Why don't you just come see the show, man? I saw it. Again. Why don't you come see the show again? Why did you see it right? You got to see it. You're seeing it all fucked up. See the show through the better eyes. Then you've seen it through. We didn't. You don't understand. It was a real trick. Yeah. By the way, the night I came to the show, they were doing this to strangers in the lobby. Well, it's been running for five years. It's like the Blue Man group in a way. Yeah.
838000	867000	The show starts when you get into the lobby. No. And there are shows where there's a show, a Rob. This show is in Vegas. It's not even us. It's yeah. We've got other guys playing us. Two guys. They're not even named Rob. Boston. Well, I saw the one. I saw the one in Phoenix that was Stanley Tucci and David Cross. That's a shit show. Rob and Rob. Those guys do it all fucked up. We're working on it. Rob and Rob, like the Blue Man group, I heard like that. Yeah.
868000	897000	Your show is like the Blue Man group was the ones we see in Vegas, New York, Chicago. It's a little more watered down than the original stuff. That's true. I heard you guys had a more hardcore version of your show before you guys started playing big markets. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. You heard that. I mean, who didn't hear that? Yeah. No. That's the review that everybody heard. Everybody's heard that. Can you guys do the scene? Rotten Tomatoes loves us. Can you do?
898000	927000	Can you do the scene? I heard it was more hardcore. What scene do you want to see? Well, I think, you know, it's the one that the controversial scene. Yes. The scene that you guys weren't allowed to do. It's why you softened up shows so much. The reason Buzzfeed and salon came down on you guys. It's really, you're going to, you're going to, because it's out of context. I get it. Like, but you shouldn't, but that's why I say it's your choice. If you want to do it. I mean, I guess we can now.
928000	957000	No, I guess we want. It's really racist. That's why. Hey, why, why Dan? Why? Stage picture, why do that? No. Dan, this is why we have a big feud. Why, why? He doesn't know how to. Why, why, why by the cow? Why by the cow? Why by the cow? Why by the cow? That's the name of the scene. That's the name of the scene is come by the cow.
958000	963000	Why by the cow? Why by the cow? Why by the cow? Why by it? The cow.
988000	1015000	What the fuck? Let it happen. Let it happen. You drop a beat, man. You drop a beat and I'll fucking do it. I feel like you don't get us. Just to be clear, that was not the controversial scene. That was a bullshit. I just pulled out of my ass. Yeah. That's how good our Britain show is.
1015000	1038000	I didn't even workshop that. Yeah. I just fucking did it. He just made that up. Right. Our written show is. Must be way better than that. Twice is good. Oh shit. This is the, this is the, to the original, like the first workshop you guys did. Oh, this is rough. You guys are rough. You guys are spit balling. You guys were just throwing it out.
1045000	1066000	Three in the morning.
1066000	1093000	Three 30.
1093000	1103000	I like to break your body down to the break of dawn. Dawn. I'm going to take you out on the foot long. I'm going to roll you around like a lower.

1182000	1211000	It's a good show. It's a good show. That was written four years ago too. It's not a terrible show. Rob's, you guys have more dates back on the west end? How long is your run going on? Oh shit. April. All the April's. You doing April? Yeah dude April's. All the May's. What's the show called again? I forget. Rob times two. Rob squared. Rob times two. Rob squared. It was either of those. What was that?
1211000	1240000	I thought it was Too Many Rob's. What? Too Many Rob's is what it's called. It's a different title every night. Yeah. You saw one and a half shows? Colin Quinn is directing it. Yeah. Uh okay so pube trimming update. We talked about pube trimming last week. Pube trim update. Hey. So? Oh man. I'm sorry about my cough. So glad you're here. Yeah.

I I I can't control the music. I love it. You can't control the shit out of this. Hey man. I I haven't I haven't trimmed my pubes yet.
1260000	1272000	But I looked at him for the first time through new eyes. Sorry, Dan. It'll it'll it'll be hard for the audience to listen. Well, Schwab is making a a pantomime drink.
1273000	1300000	Well, just take the cup and scoop it. You could just scoop. That's a holdover from the tetanus bucket. I didn't trim my. Oh, what's that? Yeah. Listen. I listened to that episode. Most of that episode today about the trimming and the watching. And I'm really interested in. Did you agree that I was being bullied? Oh, no.
1300000	1329000	No, I don't know. I think you may be a might have. But I was I felt like in my car listening. I was being a little bullied too. So maybe that's what you were feeling. But you want to talk about your your pube regimen. I would like to. How I would love Cordray. How are you being pube bullied? Hashtag. I felt like I related to Dan in that I don't pay much attention to that. And I have a. I pay attention. I'm I got to pay attention.
1330000	1359000	I'm married to a woman who tells me that it's not a big thing. That's code or it is a big thing. But it's a huge thing. But I think it's not a big thing that you keep the toilet seat up. But I do think. And this is not me bullying you. This is me like going to you like an AA going like, hey, man, I know that look like if we waited for them to ask, like, we're not good people, right? Right. We should just do it. Thinking about it. Sometimes I did it. I've done it.
1360000	1388000	At times I did it when I was like 12 because I started coming in and get him out of here. Oh, no, I shaved my legs. I was like, I said, like, I mean, I was pushing the hair up my legs so that it would look like I had more hair on my legs because I had masculinity. I looked I looked at my pubes for the for through these eyes after that episode. Not too shabby. You know, it's not not too shabby. It's not too. It's not too shrubby.
1389000	1415000	It's OK. You might not have an issue. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to do it later. Do you what's it like for me down there? Yeah. Yeah. It looks like Larry from the Three Stooges. Oh, because before this was gray, it was like kind of dark red. And it's what there's a dick in the middle of it. So it looks like Larry from the Three Stooges.
1415000	1433000	But it's all it gets a little dready. You're just dreadlocky. You're like, yeah. And I shave it. But I shave it. I feel like I'm just shaving it for me. You know, because you get a ball. You get dreadlocks down there. I get. Yeah.

You didn't hear it. There's only one. He gets really nervous during that part of the show. Right. All right. All right. So I have to warm up for a day. This is my zone. Come on.
1528000	1557000	Knock it off. Yeah. Come on. Let's knock it off. It's so funny. Let's knock it off. Stop it. Stop it, please. How dare. How dare you spend all week talking. Well, like. Surround Courtney, you listened to the episode and you said, Oh, I identify with that. I wish I was here. Yeah. I wish I had been here for that. Are we just going to talk about pubes? Are we? No, but what I want to get is.
1558000	1559000	Is our late guest here. The guy that dispenses laws and just. I know I have a fucking sore throat. Jesus, you guys. We have more guests. Yeah. We have a million more guests. All right. Well, let's bring up the one, the one that's the one waiting in the wings. I pee while this one comes up. Yeah, I guess. I do it all the time. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. You're allowed. You're allowed to take pee breaks. You don't go. This is sort of a, this is a bit we're doing. I
1588000	1618000	want to spoil it, but you guys are feeling really Sasha Baron Cohen. Like Rob Cordry's going to come back as this character. But I want you to know that because it's so convincing that people don't get the joke. So I want people to know this is like, no, this is like, uh, uh, you know, Bob Zamuda, like the doing Tony Clifton. Let's just like, okay. So now that Rob Cordry has left the stage, we're going to bring up a whole different person.
1618000	1648000	He's a Chicago improv instructor, uh, who has a blog and a podcast about such nonsense and interviews. Uh, there's a lot of intimate interviews with people. Please welcome Jimmy. Oh my God. That's amazing. Wow. Okay. Jimmy.
1648000	1678000	You're not Rob Cordry. Hi, Dan. It's good to be here. Now I feel bad because you, I don't think you heard them. No, I was back there. I'm just slow. I'm on Chicago time. Oh no. Uh, yeah. Hey, how are you? You interviewed me once for your podcast. Nerd, nerd, nerd, improv nerd. And can I just share something about your podcast?
1678000	1707980	Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. Great. So I go to your house, nice house, and we go to the fuck man. He said it was a nice house. That's not cool. Okay. Okay. Okay. So you live in this structure. Okay. It's a decent structure. Okay. And, uh, I get there and you're really nice. You, uh, you let me in.
1708000	1736440	Your, your, your bar is low. Right. Right. And it's three in the afternoon and you have all the lights off. All right. And we're going to sit down for the interview and we're about to start it. And there's like, uh, a little crack of light coming through one of the, the, the, uh, there's a shade that's got about two inches. And all of a sudden you go, wait, wait, wait, wait before we start. And you get up and you pull the shade down to make it completely dark. Now, what is that about?
1736440	1766280	Let me, let me answer that. Okay. He hates all brightness and sunlight. He hates that. He just doesn't want any bright light. I didn't like it. Well, it, it hurts your eyes. That room where the light comes out. That's a room where he keeps all of his joy. Yeah. Yeah. And he has to pull that shade down to make sure no joy escapes. I'm not a big daylight guy. He doesn't like sun. Doesn't like sunshine. I call, you know what I call the sun. What? Yellow.
1766440	1793000	Hitler. That's two times where I don't like it. It's, it's, it, it seeks to invade and annex my, my life. I'm like, I'd be so much happier just working like at night. I'd understand that the sun is important on some levels to life on earth. I do get that. Okay.
1793640	1811080	But personally, I find it offensive. I really do. It's bright and hot. It's ridiculous. So, but if you, if you went into a room and someone had put a giant ball of flaming gas in the corner, you would be like, can, can someone deal with this?
1811440	1818800	But don't you get, don't you get depressed? Like I'm from Chicago and if I don't get enough sunlight, I get that seasonal effect disorder. You don't get depressed at all.
1818800	1847120	It's too narcissistic. The sun doesn't cheer me up. It competes with me. I don't get, I don't get depressed. I get depressed when the sun starts fucking, fucking up my shit. Like, get out of here, yellow Hitler. What do you want? And it's like, I've been here for 8 billion years. And I'm like, oh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll take your word for it. What have you done for me lately? There's a new son in town.
1849240	1852320	All right. So that's your secret. It's just being narcissistic.
1852520	1872320	I don't know. I genuinely like, I'm, I have a vitamin D deficiency. I just got diagnosed with it and it's probably obviously because I hate yellow Hitler. So really a very sensitive to light and heat and stuff. I'd rather be hot than cold, but I just, you know, I, I like, I'm with Dan. I don't like the sun either. I don't like going out doing things.
1872320	1891920	I associate, I associate the outdoors with a lot of rigmarole, like just a lot of, just a lot of non Commodore 64 programming. A lot of, a lot of just like, why can't you hit this ball with this stick? What's wrong with you? And there's no, like, give me a typewriter.
1891920	1909760	I like, it's a, it just, it's just like, it's bright and it's like everything out there is fake and, and bullshit. And like when your, your dad survived the polio epidemic and he, so he has one withered leg and those moments when he does try out of father guilt to, to take you in the front yard and throw the baseball with you.
1909760	1935600	It's like really embarrassing. And that's like, I associate the sun with social anxiety, guilt, shame, bullying. Recess was the worst. Like I, as bad as school was, it was like the bell would ring and everyone would go, yay, we get to go outside and play more baseball than in gym class. You fucking assholes. I would just find the darkest like bush that I could find.
1935600	1945600	And like, there'd be two other kids in there and they'd go, did you see Jaws again? Yeah, I did. I saw it as much as I fucking could. I can't wait to watch Jaws again.
1945600	1951600	So, so turning all the lights out at three o'clock in the afternoon, you're recreating your childhood, basically.
1951600	1957600	Yeah, I'm trying to deprive my senses and enter a more comfortable zone.
1957600	1975600	I hid under my bed until I was 24. Did you see Rob's biopic powder? Yeah, yes. Yeah. I'm trying to get, I'm trying. This is getting ridiculous here. Somebody's playing a joke.
1976600	1979600	Put your glasses back on.
1989600	1993600	Oh, there you go. He's not, Cordred, get with it. Oh, I do.
1998600	2003600	What if the world, I couldn't figure out what the monkey did. My monkey.
2003600	2011600	How can I get the Chicago franchise of your show? I know there's a bidding war going on right now. That's why I'm out here in LA. Really? Yeah.
2011600	2028600	Depends on what you can do for us. Yeah, what's your deal? It depends on what your favorite number from their show is. I mean, if you wanted to- Jeff keeps trying to force us to do shitty hit- I love the ending number. I think the ending number.
2028600	2042600	Oh, shit. The ending number. I mean, that's- That's very sad. That's a very sad- It's sad. Jimmy, do you think that Chicago can afford the rights to the ending number of Rob Cordred? This show couldn't- Maybe for a weekend. We could do like a weekend run.
2042600	2053600	Yeah, we could do like a limited run. Yeah. I can do that. But me and Trump would do it. Right? Is it fair to- You can play David Cross's part. Thank you.
2054600	2070600	God, what if it's possible to get David Cross in here? Right now? Oh, God. If David Cross is watching- If he walked in, he's a subscriber. The special effects from Timecop would start happening and you guys would all start turning into pudding.
2070600	2091600	Is that what you're trying to do to me right now? I want you to know what it's like. I love it. I'm in heaven. I wish every day was like this. This is the best. Your glasses don't fit. Hey, Jimmy. They don't fit? My face? Yes, Dan. Yes, Dan.
2091600	2100600	What is the- When you teach an improv class, what's the first thing you start with? Timing.
2107600	2120600	Yes, I start with timing. Yeah. Do you teach people just off the street anymore or do you just teach people- No, no. I become that good. I don't have to teach you off the street anymore.
2120600	2134600	You just teach- You just teach people- People that pay, Dan. That's what I'm looking for, basically. Jimmy, where do you teach? Where in Chicago do you teach? I actually teach for myself. I teach at stage 773 in Green Shirt Studio. Yeah.
2134600	2143600	Do you do- I'm assuming long form because you're Chicago. Yes, I do long form, yes. Do you do the heraldy thing or do you do your own- Let things be what they are.
2143600	2153600	I do something called the Art of Slow Comedy, which is basically let's slow it down a little, not trying to be funny and it'll happen organically. It's listening, right?
2153600	2163600	Exactly. What did you say? Exactly. Do people know you have an improv background and you go all the way back to comedy sports in Milwaukee?
2163600	2180600	That's where we met. It's short form though, but when I go to see it, one thing I wanted to ask you because I think this is important because you're in Chicago, you're at the epicenter of good long form improv.
2180600	2196600	In L.A., where it's not necessarily a, you know, but you tell these kids listening, if they live in L.A., where would you recommend they go if they want to see the, in your opinion, just like creme de la creme long form improv?
2196600	2206600	In Chicago or Los Angeles? Los Angeles. Oh, Los Angeles, I think the UCB is just great. Rob, do they still do- they do ASCAT, right?
2206600	2222600	Yeah, they do every Sunday night. And then I think- Competing with this show. There are some shows at the I.O. West, Weird Dass with Bob Dassie and Stephanie Weir. There are Dass Ariski, which is, he was on Community, Craig Kakowski, Rich Telerico and Bob Dassie.
2222600	2231600	They're the best improvisers. Those three? Yeah, I think. I saw Stephanie Weir do a thing with, you know, Joe Bill. Yeah, from Chicago.
2231600	2241600	Yeah, Mark Sutton, Bath Prav. Yeah. Where there's two guys sitting in a fake boat and just talk forever, and Stephanie Weir came on and she absolutely killed it.
2241600	2248600	And they asked me to be honest, I was like, no, I'm scared. Because that's really, like, ballsy improv.
2248600	2257600	I did a show with Stephanie years ago called Naked. It was just two of us. We did one long scene. It was in your apartment. Yes.
2258600	2269600	The laws were different back then, Dan. It's a long-form bathtub scene. Yeah. Yeah. But there was no lighting. It was dark. You would have liked it.
2272600	2276600	But she was one of the best improvisers I've ever worked with. Yeah.
2277600	2289600	The amount of self-control and, for real, listening and eye contact and letting things build based on, like, absolute attention is really amazing.
2289600	2295600	There's not something we do here. I was talking! Reverse!
2296600	2304600	There is. It's about listening. Because when I watch long-form improv and people are good at it, I'm like, how the fuck?
2304600	2312600	Like, there's no... I can only think about one thing at once at a time. And, like, for instance, how to construct a sentence.
2312600	2315600	You're doing great, Dan.
2316600	2326600	When I'm off stage in those moments, if somebody says, this is great soup, and then I'm like, soup, soup, soup, soup, connecting soup,
2326600	2332600	and then they're talking about all kinds of shit and the other person's saying something. You have to actually absorb it and process it.
2332600	2338600	The same things that make you good at long-form improv are the things that probably make you a good person in a conversation.
2339600	2346600	I know some great long-form improvers that I wouldn't call great, socially interactive people.
2346600	2355600	There is an ability to really focus. Also, you can be any kind of person and be good at long-form improv, I think.
2355600	2360600	And here's another rule about long-form improv. Always let the guest speak.
2361600	2364600	And that's why it's... Oh, sorry.
2365600	2375600	No, but for me, for the podcast improv nerd, I've interviewed over 180 people, and I don't have a journalist...
2375600	2379600	Well, everybody has, but 180 noteworthy people.
2379600	2385600	Yes, yes. Thank you, Dan. And, of course, I got into podcasting for the money.
2385600	2390600	I went from public radio, and I'm like, you know what? It's podcasting. There's more money than public radio.
2390600	2392600	They should call it cha-ching-casting.
2392600	2394600	Yes, they really should.
2394600	2395600	I think that sounds racist.
2395600	2399600	You do one...slightly racist.
2399600	2401600	That's why they don't do it, I think. That's my theory.
2401600	2405600	Yeah, but you're podcasting, so you can get away with racist stuff that you can't get onto rest of your radio.
2405600	2407600	If you get away with it, it's demanded of me.
2407600	2408600	Yes, yeah.
2408600	2412600	If I don't feed these people racism, they'll go over to Marin.
2412600	2417600	Yeah, exactly. People were lined up in front tonight, like, we want more racism.
2417600	2419600	I didn't want to tell you this, but that's what they're looking for.
2419600	2423600	Build that wall. Drill, baby, drill. Harman, Harman, Harman.
2423600	2427600	Because you're going to come out and endorse Trump in a couple minutes. Did I give it away?
2427600	2431600	Look, I've been endorsing him since he was in Pizza Hut commercials.
2431600	2437600	I was like, can we elect him to do all pizza commercials? Why does he have to be just Pizza Hut?
2438600	2444600	I was the first person to sign the Make Him Oranger petition.
2445600	2448600	I want him to be so orange that he's a literal orange.
2449600	2452600	Is it okay to say that tonight's proceeds are going to his campaign?
2452600	2460600	Absolutely. If you stepped in this building, you helped him take over the world and kill minorities.
2461600	2464600	Until minorities?
2464600	2469600	Kill minorities. It feels bad when you make me repeat it.
2470600	2475600	It's even worse when the title of this episode is called Kill Minorities.
2476600	2479600	I don't even want to say it because I would feel really bad.
2479600	2483600	Can I share something, what happened when I flew in for this show?
2483600	2485600	Yes, you can.
2485600	2487600	You flew in for this show?
2487600	2490600	I did. I don't have much going on in Chicago.
2493600	2498600	If you listen to the podcast, you know I have a lot of low self-esteem.
2498600	2503600	I was feeling a lot of shame because I was thinking about an interview I had just done.
2503600	2508600	I wrote on the top of my notebook that I want to die.
2509600	2517600	Somebody who was sitting across the aisle saw it and went to the back of the airlines.
2517600	2523600	Then the flight attendant comes and says, can we see you in the back?
2523600	2524600	Jesus Christ!
2524600	2526600	I swear to God, this is true.
2526600	2529600	She's like, finally, it's like Rosemary's baby back there.
2529600	2531600	We've been waiting for you.
2533600	2535600	I say, you know what, you've got a problem.
2535600	2540600	She goes, well, we hope not.
2540600	2544600	Both sides of this conversation are ill.
2544600	2547600	You guys were both saying exactly the wrong things.
2547600	2550600	Do we have a problem? I hope not.
2556600	2560600	They take me all the way back to where the bathrooms are at the back of the plane.
2560600	2563600	Now it's three flight attendants.
2563600	2565600	And she's the head flight attendant.
2565600	2567600	So hot, dear Penthouse.
2570600	2574600	I want to die because my dick's so big.
2574600	2577600	That's the detail you left out.
2579600	2583600	I need a character witness at court, if in case, I'm going to call you.
2586600	2589600	I had my phone out.
2589600	2591600	Dick, your dick.
2591600	2592600	You can say dick.
2592600	2594600	Okay, I thought it was a podcast.
2594600	2596600	No, no, you can say anything.
2596600	2599600	So I had my iPhone out and I was timing myself.
2599600	2605600	So she goes, all right, someone complained that you had written, you want to die.
2605600	2609600	And why did you have your cell phone out on a timer?
2609600	2615600	And I said, because I was meditating, which was totally true.
2615600	2618600	She says, well, you know, this is really serious, whatever.
2618600	2621600	So I go back and I sit back in my seat.
2621600	2625600	And I know the guy who's doing it, but I don't want to make eye contact with him.
2625600	2627600	Can you rewind?
2627600	2631600	In that moment, which is really crucial, because they summoned you back.
2631600	2633600	And they said all that stuff.
2633600	2635600	And you're getting to a destination in the story.
2635600	2637600	But at that moment, what the fuck?
2637600	2639600	Good question.
2639600	2641600	You wrote this and I was meditating.
2641600	2644600	And she's like, well, this is a big deal.
2644600	2646600	And then you go back to your seat.
2646600	2648600	How did that conversation really end?
2648600	2650600	Some suicidal thoughts in there, Dan.
2650600	2652600	And then there's like, oh, my God, what the fuck have I done?
2652600	2656600	What is happening in that moment before you go back to your seat?
2656600	2658600	As much dialogue as you can remember of that seat.
2658600	2660600	Is I'm going back to the seat?
2660600	2662600	No, no, before you go back to the seat.
2662600	2665600	These people have summoned you from your seat to the back of the parade.
2665600	2667600	I don't know what.
2667600	2668600	I don't know what.
2668600	2670600	I'm like, what have I done?
2670600	2672600	Partly thinks maybe they're going to upgrade me to first class,
2672600	2674600	but I know that's a stretch.
2674600	2677600	That's a total stretch.
2678600	2683600	But I'm saying in the moment, I'm fascinated by this moment.
2683600	2686600	So you say, well, this is a big deal.
2686600	2689600	And you went, uh-huh, and just faded back?
2689600	2691600	That's the part that I'm talking about.
2691600	2695600	Because that sounds like just like, it sounds like I'm about to find out
2695600	2700600	that life is controlled by an eight-year-old playing with Barbie dolls.
2700600	2701600	What was the big deal?
2701600	2703600	Okay.
2703600	2705600	There must be more to that.
2705600	2707600	No, I'm glad you cleared that up.
2707600	2708600	I don't want to give that impression.
2708600	2710600	It wasn't that at all.
2710600	2712600	I'm in trouble.
2712600	2714600	I have been summoned by the principal.
2714600	2715600	I don't know what it is.
2715600	2719600	But if authority has asked me to go to the back of the airplane,
2719600	2721600	I must have done something wrong.
2721600	2723600	Right.
2723600	2725600	But in that moment, okay, wait.
2725600	2726600	Okay.
2726600	2727600	I'm with you.
2727600	2728600	I'm with you here.
2728600	2729600	Can we do an improv?
2729600	2730600	I will be the flight attendant.
2730600	2731600	Okay, great.
2731600	2732600	Great.
2732600	2733600	Okay.
2733600	2734600	Sir.
2734600	2735600	Okay.
2735600	2739600	I'm going to sit like I'm really sitting in the seat.
2739600	2740600	Okay.
2740600	2741600	Okay.
2741600	2742600	We'll start there.
2742600	2743600	Okay, great.
2743600	2744600	Good.
2744600	2745600	Okay.
2745600	2746600	Okay.
2746600	2747600	Okay.
2747600	2754600	We're traveling at 35,000 feet, cruising altitude.
2754600	2761600	If you look out to the left, you'll see the Grand Canyon.
2762600	2770600	Ladies and gentlemen, I've been asked to inform you that one of the microphones is available.
2770600	2780600	Some of the people addressing you are not pilots.
2780600	2781600	Hello, passengers.
2781600	2786600	I'm your captain.
2786600	2789600	A great way to know who your captain is.
2789600	2792600	He refers to you as ladies and gentlemen.
2792600	2793600	That's not your captain.
2793600	2794600	Ladies and gentlemen.
2794600	2795600	Clearly.
2795600	2802600	Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know.
2802600	2804600	Despite what you may have heard.
2804600	2808600	Hello, everybody.
2808600	2812600	This is Captain Awesome.
2812600	2815600	Don't listen to those squares trying to tell you what to do.
2815600	2818600	This is Captain Evil.
2818600	2819600	Oh, you.
2819600	2822600	Captain Awesome, we meet again.
2822600	2826600	Well, you won't find me.
2826600	2828600	I'm going to hide behind this chair.
2828600	2834600	Well, Captain Awesome, did you realize that there's a person who might have suicidal tendencies?
2834600	2835600	No, I didn't.
2835600	2837600	Yeah, he's writing down some weird shit.
2837600	2839600	Well, we better get somebody on that.
2839600	2840600	Who do we have there?
2840600	2842600	We have our best flight attendant on the job.
2842600	2843600	Oh, my God.
2843600	2844600	Hey, guys.
2844600	2847600	It's Stacy.
2847600	2852600	As you can probably hear, there's some drama in the cockpit.
2852600	2856600	Captain Evil and Dr. Awesome are flying a plane.
2856600	2859600	They go at it like cats in a bath.
2859600	2863600	But they are great and they have landed over 500.
2863600	2864600	Awesome.
2864600	2865600	So just return to your things.
2865600	2870600	The other two captains were just crazy people with a microphone.
2870600	2872600	But those have been turned off.
2872600	2873600	I'm going to...
2873600	2879600	I'll go about your cabin and have a bun.
2879600	2881600	Excuse me.
2881600	2885600	I didn't get a bun.
2885600	2887600	Just walked right by me.
2887600	2889600	Just walked right by me.
2889600	2891600	Just walked right by me.
2891600	2894600	I didn't get a bun.
2894600	2897600	Sir, can I see your ticket?
2897600	2899600	Me.
2903600	2908600	This is a drawing of a plane in crayon.
2908600	2911600	Read the bottom.
2911600	2915600	I love you too, sir, but...
2915600	2918600	This is Captain Evil.
2918600	2920600	We are now flying directly into the sun.
2920600	2921600	Sorry, I got to go.
2921600	2922600	That's not true.
2922600	2925600	We have 30 minutes to live.
2925600	2926600	Okay, everybody.
2926600	2927600	This is Stacy.
2927600	2928600	That's not true.
2928600	2930600	The plane is nowhere near the sun.
2930600	2933600	That would make it a spaceship.
2933600	2935600	We'll be landing in California,
2935600	2937600	and I won't tell you the city.
2937600	2939600	It'll be a surprise.
2939600	2940600	In about five hours.
2940600	2941600	Go about your business,
2941600	2945600	and let's continue with the original reason for this.
2950600	2953600	Excuse me, sir.
2953600	2954600	Hi.
2954600	2956600	Could you see us in the back of the plane?
2956600	2957600	Is there a problem?
2957600	2961600	You have a problem?
2961600	2963600	I'm just asking.
2963600	2966600	I hope there will be a problem.
2966600	2967600	I've been flying...
2967600	2971600	So you want to throw down with me?
2971600	2973600	Bing, bong.
2973600	2974600	This is Captain Evil.
2974600	2978600	You are free to move about the plane.
2978600	2981600	Sir, if you could just follow me.
2981600	2983600	We just want to speak with you for a moment.
2983600	2984600	There's nothing.
2984600	2987600	There's no need to get aggro.
2987600	2988600	Aggro?
2988600	2989600	Sir, don't.
2989600	2990600	Don't.
2990600	2994600	Don't act like you don't know the lingo.
2994600	2995600	I...
2995600	2996600	I don't.
2996600	2998600	Sir, what's your name?
2998600	2999600	Why do you want to know my name?
2999600	3001600	You're Jimmy Caraine, aren't you?
3001600	3002600	Yes.
3002600	3003600	I know.
3003600	3006600	I'm a flight attendant.
3006600	3009600	Why were you so evasive?
3009600	3012600	I was just hoping you'd recognize me.
3012600	3016600	Jimmy.
3016600	3018600	See what I've written down on my notebook?
3018600	3021600	Oh, sir, I love you too.
3021600	3022600	All right.
3022600	3023600	Oh, yes.
3023600	3024600	Okay, this is gone.
3024600	3025600	Yeah, I know.
3025600	3026600	We had it.
3026600	3027600	Come on, start over.
3027600	3028600	You jackasses.
3028600	3029600	All right.
3029600	3030600	Okay.
3030600	3035600	Ladies and gentlemen, so look out for the Grand Canyon.
3035600	3036600	Oh, wow.
3036600	3039600	Excuse me.
3039600	3040600	Yes.
3040600	3041600	Hi.
3041600	3042600	Oh, sorry.
3042600	3043600	What?
3043600	3044600	Yeah.
3044600	3045600	No.
3045600	3046600	For a second.
3046600	3047600	In fact, you were coming on to me.
3047600	3048600	You were like flirting with me.
3048600	3049600	What the fuck?
3049600	3050600	No.
3050600	3051600	I'm serious.
3051600	3053600	You brought me water twice.
3053600	3057600	I never asked for water in this napkin.
3057600	3061600	I need to talk to someone.
3061600	3063600	Well, I'll be here.
3063600	3064600	I'm not going anywhere.
3064600	3065600	Not you.
3065600	3066600	Oh.
3066600	3067600	I'll be right back.
3067600	3068600	Okay.
3068600	3074600	Stacy, what's going on?
3074600	3075600	What's going on?
3075600	3076600	Rebecca?
3076600	3077600	Yeah.
3077600	3078600	It's me, Rebecca.
3078600	3079600	I'm on the wing.
3079600	3080600	Shh.
3080600	3081600	I want to.
3081600	3084600	Can you let me in?
3084600	3086600	It's freezing out here.
3086600	3087600	Hold on.
3087600	3089600	There's a woman on the wing.
3089600	3090600	Yes.
3090600	3094600	There's a woman on the wing.
3094600	3095600	Rebecca.
3095600	3096600	Yes.
3096600	3097600	Yes.
3097600	3098600	This is Captain Evil.
3098600	3101600	Everything is okay.
3101600	3104600	Rebecca, there's this really weird guy.
3104600	3106600	He gave me a really weird vibe.
3106600	3107600	What happened?
3107600	3108600	What happened?
3108600	3109600	Just tell me what happened.
3109600	3110600	I don't know.
3110600	3113600	He said, he said, I think he thinks that I don't mean something.
3113600	3114600	This always happens to me.
3114600	3115600	I brought him two waters.
3115600	3116600	He took it as a thing.
3116600	3117600	This always happens to me.
3117600	3118600	Let me talk to him.
3118600	3119600	Let's go talk to him.
3119600	3120600	Let's go.
3120600	3121600	Let's bring him in the bag.
3121600	3126600	Oh, are you talking?
3126600	3127600	Shh.
3127600	3128600	Ah.
3128600	3129600	Shh.
3129600	3130600	Are you coming?
3130600	3131600	Shh.
3131600	3134600	Keep closing the door on me.
3134600	3135600	Okay.
3135600	3136600	Where's this?
3136600	3137600	Where's this man here?
3137600	3138600	Where is he?
3138600	3139600	He's in 3D.
3139600	3140600	Oh.
3140600	3141600	Wait.
3141600	3147600	But he's in seat 22F.
3147600	3152600	I just wanted you to know he's not flat.
3152600	3155600	Okay.
3156600	3168600	Ironically, the person seated in 3D, which is first class, is famous for his 2D animation.
3168600	3171600	He's in 22F, the weirdo.
3171600	3176600	He has a thing written on his notebook that says he wants to kill himself.
3176600	3177600	Oh my God.
3177600	3178600	That is serious.
3178600	3179600	I've never handled.
3179600	3180600	I'm going to take care of it.
3180600	3184600	I'm going to hand out pineapple.
3185600	3187600	Pineapple, do you want to go with him?
3187600	3188600	Yeah.
3188600	3189600	Yeah.
3192600	3194600	Hey, Rebecca.
3194600	3195600	Hi, Pineapple.
3195600	3197600	I'm going to go with you.
3197600	3199600	Let's all three go together to talk to them.
3199600	3201600	Let the three of us go together.
3201600	3202600	Okay.
3202600	3203600	I'm standing behind you.
3203600	3204600	Okay.
3204600	3205600	Okay.
3205600	3206600	Excuse me, sir.
3206600	3207600	Hey.
3207600	3208600	Oh, look.
3208600	3209600	You brought your friends, huh?
3209600	3210600	Yeah.
3210600	3211600	You're showing me off.
3211600	3212600	Yes.
3213600	3216600	Could you come to the back of the plane, please, where the toilets are?
3216600	3217600	Yeah.
3217600	3218600	Could you come back?
3218600	3219600	Can you come by the toilets?
3219600	3220600	Can you come by the toilets?
3220600	3221600	My name's Pineapple.
3221600	3222600	Can you see me in the back of the plane, sir?
3222600	3223600	Yeah.
3223600	3224600	Can you follow us?
3224600	3225600	Would you mind?
3225600	3226600	No, I don't have a problem.
3226600	3227600	Sir, will you please?
3227600	3228600	No.
3228600	3229600	Please come to the back of the plane.
3229600	3230600	Sir, please.
3230600	3231600	Stop being...
3231600	3232600	Stop resisting.
3232600	3234600	You're making pineapple sour.
3234600	3236600	Why are you being a problem, sir?
3236600	3237600	You're souring pineapple.
3237600	3238600	I just...
3238600	3239600	I said yes.
3239600	3240600	I said yes like 12 times.
3240600	3241600	My name's Pineapple.
3242600	3244600	Come to the back of the plane.
3244600	3245600	Come to the back of the plane.
3245600	3246600	I'm coming.
3246600	3247600	I'm going to lead.
3247600	3249600	I just want to get my personal things with him right now.
3249600	3250600	Pineapple, you don't need your things.
3250600	3252600	We are beginning our descent into the surface of the sun.
3252600	3253600	You got 35 minutes.
3253600	3254600	We better hurry up.
3254600	3255600	That's not true.
3255600	3256600	We're going to hurry up.
3256600	3258600	Here we are at the back of the plane.
3258600	3259600	Sir.
3259600	3260600	Sir.
3260600	3261600	Sir.
3261600	3262600	I have your notebook right here.
3262600	3263600	I'm holding it.
3263600	3264600	Sir.
3264600	3265600	Sir.
3265600	3266600	Wait a second.
3266600	3267600	What were you mouthing, Stacey?
3267600	3268600	I was mouthing her words because I'm shy.
3268600	3269600	Stacey.
3269600	3270600	I thought you said I love you.
3270600	3271600	No.
3271600	3272600	Fuck.
3272600	3273600	God damn it.
3273600	3274600	Sir, why did you?
3274600	3275600	Sir, why did you?
3275600	3276600	Sir, you're all fucked up.
3276600	3277600	Sir.
3277600	3278600	Sir.
3278600	3279600	I'm fucked up and your name is Pineapple?
3279600	3280600	My name's Pineapple.
3280600	3281600	Sir.
3281600	3282600	My name is Pineapple.
3282600	3284600	Can I ask why?
3284600	3285600	God damn it.
3285600	3287600	You don't have to get defensive.
3287600	3288600	I'm defensive.
3288600	3292600	Why did you write I want to die on your notebook?
3292600	3293600	Let's get to the meat of it.
3293600	3294600	Why did you do that?
3294600	3295600	Why did you do this?
3295600	3296600	Why would you ever do that?
3296600	3297600	Pineapple.
3297600	3299600	It's a terrible thing to write.
3299600	3303600	Pineapple.
3303600	3304600	Go ahead.
3304600	3306600	I wanted the attention.
3306600	3308600	He wanted the attention.
3308600	3309600	From someone.
3309600	3310600	Oh.
3310600	3311600	From someone.
3311600	3312600	Okay.
3312600	3313600	Well, I understand that.
3313600	3314600	My name's Pineapple.
3314600	3315600	Oh, yeah.
3315600	3317600	That never gets you any attention.
3317600	3318600	Bing bong.
3318600	3319600	Yeah.
3319600	3320600	I understand that.
3320600	3321600	My name is Captain Evil.
3321600	3322600	Let me know.
3322600	3323600	Who's zooming who?
3323600	3326600	Who's zooming who here?
3326600	3328600	If I don't get something, if I don't get something I like, I'm going to kill my mother.
3328600	3330600	If I don't get something I like, I'm going to kill myself.
3330600	3332600	Oh, jeez.
3332600	3335600	Stacy.
3335600	3336600	Stacy.
3336600	3338600	Looks like this is all in you, Stacy.
3338600	3339600	Stacy.
3339600	3340600	Don't do this.
3340600	3341600	Stacy.
3341600	3342600	Stacy.
3342600	3343600	Be professional, Stacy.
3343600	3344600	Don't.
3344600	3346600	Don't whore out again, Stacy.
3346600	3347600	Don't fuck this up, Stacy.
3347600	3348600	Don't be a whore.
3348600	3349600	Don't fuck this up.
3349600	3350600	Stacy.
3350600	3351600	I know that look in your eyes.
3351600	3352600	Stacy.
3352600	3353600	Stop.
3353600	3354600	Don't do it.
3354600	3355600	Don't give in to being a whore.
3355600	3356600	Don't do it.
3356600	3357600	Oh, Stacy.
3357600	3358600	Time!
3358600	3359600	Oh, jeez.
3359600	3360600	Stacy.
3360600	3361600	Oh, my God.
3361600	3362600	I stopped time.
3362600	3363600	Bing-bong.
3363600	3364600	The same thing is happening.
3364600	3365600	I'm going to kill you.
3365600	3366600	Stacy.

3429600	3431600	Stacy.
3431600	3439600	Stacy.
3439600	3443600	I'd kill myself if you didn't say what you just said.
3443600	3449600	It seems like a perfectly healthy relationship.
3449600	3457600	We should build like 50 years on this and involve children and strangers.
3457600	3460600	I'd kill myself if you loved me.
3460600	3466600	It's almost like we're dependent at the same time on each other.
3466600	3469600	Sounds great.
3469600	3476600	I realize now that I got into the air travel biz because...
3476600	3478600	Sorry, I'm...
3478600	3479600	Rebecca, let's go.
3479600	3489600	Stop time only for you!
3489600	3496600	Screw it! Screw it! Screw it! Screw it! Screw it! Screw it! Screw it! Screw it! Screw it!
3507600	3510600	Parachute compartment.
3513600	3517600	Do not tamper with parachutes.
3519600	3521600	Sharpie pen container.
3524600	3528600	That's what you get when you fuck with me.
3539600	3541600	Resume time for her!
3550600	3552600	This is Captain Evil.
3552600	3556600	If you look at the left side of your plane, this is Samantha.
3556600	3559600	Safely parachuting to her.
3559600	3563600	To her not deaf. She's fine. She's fine. She has a parachute.
3563600	3565600	She's going to be okay.
3566600	3570600	We were at a low enough altitude, she's going to be alright.
3580600	3582600	Hello?
3582600	3584600	Natalie.
3584600	3587600	This is Samantha, I think.
3590600	3593600	Or maybe Rebecca, I'm not sure.
3593600	3595600	Stacey, possibly. I admit to Stacey.
3595600	3596600	Hello, yes?
3596600	3598600	Are you falling much?
3598600	3604600	I'm falling. I'm falling. But this parachute, there's something written on it.
3605600	3610600	Oh, this is so real nice.
3611600	3615600	Just real nice. Real nice.
3615600	3618600	I bet you think you're pretty cool now.
3618600	3620600	Stopping time, being cool now.
3620600	3622600	I tried to help you.
3622600	3625600	I tried to help you with your disfigurement.
3625600	3627600	Were you trying to help me?
3627600	3631600	I had said to the pilot, you should watch BoJack Horseman.
3631600	3633600	And you were like, that's stupid.
3633600	3635600	And you were like undercutting me.
3635600	3638600	And I said, you should watch Baskets.
3638600	3641600	And you were like, that's stupid.
3641600	3643600	You don't have good taste in comedy.
3643600	3646600	And now you're going to have great taste in pavement.
3648600	3651600	Well, I guess you win. I guess you win.
3651600	3654600	You don't guess I win.
3654600	3656600	I guess you win. I guess you win.
3656600	3658600	What are you going to do with all that win?
3658600	3660600	What are you going to do with that win now?
3660600	3663600	You're going to buy a smile with that?
3663600	3664600	Probably not.
3664600	3666600	Because you're a big fat piece of shit no one likes.
3666600	3668600	You're a big fat piece of shit no one likes.
3668600	3670600	And all the customers hate you too.
3670600	3674600	They tell me that you're a big fat piece of shit.
3674600	3675600	You're a piece of shit.
3675600	3678600	Stop! Time for her!
3679600	3689600	Feel the air marshal, cabinet.
3700600	3704600	Point break! Point break!
3709600	3711600	Stop! Time for me too!
3714600	3716600	Resume time for both of us!
3732600	3734600	Three hours later...
3735600	3739600	So what do you make of this, Sergeant?
3739600	3747600	Looks to me like a girl met another girl, shot her, both exploded.
3749600	3756600	But don't you think it all kind of started with that guy who kind of made a weird suicide note on the plane?
3756600	3759600	Don't know what you're talking about.
3760600	3764600	Working this municipality just underneath the air.
3764600	3770600	Isn't anybody concerned also that this plane was being captained by a guy named Captain Awesome and Captain Evil?
3770600	3773600	What kind of business have we run in here?
3773600	3776600	I didn't know there were planes involved.
3778600	3780600	I'm Woody Harrelson.
3781600	3783600	And I'm Pineapple.
3790600	3798600	And with all due goddamn respect, Pineapple, why don't you either just do the goddamn police work or shoot my job?
3801600	3804600	It's in the way that you use it.
3805600	3807600	Those are the credits.
3807600	3810600	So Jimmy, is that how it happened?
3810600	3812600	Great that. Great that.
3812600	3814600	I'm going to ask you something.
3814600	3815600	Go ahead.
3815600	3818600	How many times do you think we could have edited that?
3818600	3819600	Oh, Jesus.
3819600	3821600	I was like, oh, my God, let's edit here.
3821600	3823600	Is that what you do as an instructor?
3823600	3824600	You're like, yeah.
3824600	3825600	Well, you edit it.
3825600	3831600	You stop the scene at a point where it really begged to be ended.
3831600	3832600	Yeah.
3833600	3837600	I mean, it was amazing because we like ran over the body like five, six, seven, eight times.
3837600	3842600	It was amazing that because like in long form once it hits, right?
3842600	3843600	Yeah.
3843600	3845600	You just go any higher.
3845600	3846600	It's so easy.
3846600	3849600	You just run across the scene like that.
3849600	3850600	Right.
3850600	3851600	And it's done.
3851600	3852600	Right.
3852600	3853600	Yeah.
3853600	3854600	But then you got to ease up.
3854600	3855600	We could have just done something like that.
3855600	3856600	Then you got to get up and walk.
3856600	3857600	No, I know.
3857600	3863600	So you're trying to tell me a lady stopping time while her arch enemy is six feet above
3863600	3869600	the pavement so that she can dive down with a gun, freeze time for herself next to the
3869600	3873600	body, and then unfreeze time for both of them so that she can have the pleasure of blowing
3873600	3876600	her friend's brains out before they both hit the pavement.
3876600	3880600	That wasn't worth 95 minutes of terrible improv.
3884600	3886600	Let's hear it with Jimmy Crane, everybody.
3886600	3887600	Oh, Jimmy!
3887600	3888600	Thank you.
3888600	3889600	Thank you so much.
3889600	3891600	Listen to his podcast and feral audio.
3891600	3892600	Thank you.
3892600	3896600	Also, while we say goodbye to Jimmy, thank you so much, Jimmy.
3896600	3897600	Thank you.
3897600	3899600	Let's bring out our other guest who just arrived.
3899600	3902600	Let's bring out Cameron Esposito.
3903600	3904600	Oh!
3906600	3908600	Yay!
3908600	3910600	Yay!
3915600	3916600	Yay!
3916600	3918600	Wow, boys!
3918600	3921600	That was a hell of a scene!
3921600	3922600	I thought...
3922600	3923600	I mean, I was...
3923600	3924600	My suspense...
3924600	3926600	I was with you till the end, you know?
3926600	3928600	I played a character named Pineapple.
3928600	3930600	Oh, I heard the name of your character.
3930600	3932600	I thought it was believably your name, you know?
3932600	3934600	I just thought, like, the way you affected...
3934600	3935600	It was mostly...
3935600	3937600	It was a lot of what you were doing with...
3937600	3938600	I really appreciate that.
3938600	3939600	Yeah, you're welcome.
3939600	3942600	Cameron, do you think that scene suffered from any structure problems?
3942600	3944600	Or do you think that the whole time?
3944600	3945600	No, I don't...
3945600	3950600	I will say that I was watching some of it on a little TV in there, and there was...
3950600	3952600	That the dialogue is off a little bit.
3952600	3954600	There was also just like a...
3954600	3959600	I don't know if you guys realize how much the three of you just look like a little team.
3960600	3962600	We talked about that.
3962600	3963600	Just like three little...
3963600	3964600	You know what I mean?
3964600	3968600	And you were on your own vibe, and that was cool, but it was just like a...
3968600	3969600	Just a real...
3969600	3970600	It didn't like it.
3970600	3971600	What do you mean?
3971600	3972600	It was just a real...
3972600	3975600	I think what I'm saying is it just looked like a real sitcom, you know what I mean?
3975600	3976600	Yeah.
3976600	3978600	Just a bunch of dudes.
3978600	3979600	So, Esposito.
3979600	3981600	A bunch of similar white dudes.
3981600	3983600	But it was called New Girl.
3983600	3984600	They should have a...
3984600	3985600	Yeah.
3986600	3988600	There was one girl, but like a bunch of dudes.
3988600	3990600	The dudes kept moving in.
3990600	3991600	Some of them were black.
3991600	3992600	They were too black.
3992600	3993600	Pineapple.
3993600	3994600	Thank God.
3994600	3995600	Pineapple was a woman.
3995600	3996600	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3996600	3997600	No, I know.
3997600	3998600	I just...
3998600	3999600	You know.
3999600	4000600	You're one of my...
4000600	4001600	I'm caught.
4001600	4003600	I sound like I'm dying for the whole thing.
4003600	4005600	You're one of my CISO mates.
4005600	4006600	You're doing a...
4006600	4007600	Yeah.
4007600	4008600	And you're stand-up special.
4008600	4011600	People are having to wait for Harmon Quest for a little bit, but you just did a stand-up
4011600	4013600	special, and it's on CISO.
4013600	4014600	It just came out.
4014600	4015600	It's called Marriage Material.
4015600	4016600	I just thought I'd randomly bring that up.
4016600	4017600	You should...
4017600	4018600	That is not...
4018600	4020600	Of course, that's not why I'm here.
4020600	4021600	What's it called?
4021600	4022600	I did not specifically...
4022600	4023600	What's it called?
4023600	4024600	It's called Marriage Material.
4024600	4025600	Marriage Material.
4025600	4026600	Isn't that a good name for a stand-up special?
4026600	4027600	Yeah.
4027600	4028600	Yeah.
4028600	4029600	I taped it two days before my wedding.
4029600	4030600	He's so pretty good.
4030600	4035600	How is the marriage going for those who don't know Rhea Butcher, who just controlled a couple
4035600	4036600	of episodes ago?
4036600	4037600	Oh, yeah.
4037600	4038600	This guy was...
4038600	4039600	He just goes, whoa.
4039600	4042600	Yeah, well, I mean, she's great.
4042600	4043600	Right.
4043600	4044600	Right.
4044600	4045600	I mean, it was just either her or Tig.
4045600	4046600	Right?
4046600	4047600	You know what I mean?
4047600	4052600	I don't know if you listened to that episode, but in the middle of it, I was like, come
4052600	4053600	on.
4053600	4054600	You don't know Tig Nataro.
4054600	4055600	And she's like, I swear I don't.
4055600	4056600	I'm like, come on.
4056600	4057600	She knows Tig.
4057600	4058600	She liked you.
4058600	4060600	One time, Tig goes, cool shirt.
4060600	4065600	And then the next time we saw Tig, she was totally wearing that shirt.
4065600	4067600	Yeah.
4067600	4068600	You married another comic.
4068600	4069600	I did.
4069600	4072600	And so now you're, what, six months into that marriage?
4072600	4073600	Three only.
4073600	4074600	We've only been married for three months.
4074600	4075600	Oh.
4075600	4076600	Yeah.
4076600	4077600	A little nascent.
4077600	4078600	So honeymoon still.
4078600	4079600	Sort of.
4079600	4081600	But you guys, were you cohabitating before that?
4081600	4082600	Yes.
4082600	4083600	Yeah.
4083600	4084600	Not to enforce the stereotype.
4084600	4085600	All right.
4085600	4094320	Well, I mean, we are lesbians, but we waited to live together until marriage.
4094320	4096600	How many Golden Retrievers do you guys have?
4096600	4100280	We just have one, but he's so small he only weighs eight pounds.
4100280	4101280	All right.
4101280	4102560	He's a teeny little guy.
4102560	4107480	Is there, like, I mean, it's probably too early to tell us the answer, but once you're
4107480	4113120	under the same roof and you guys are both doing the same thing, like, do you ever worry
4113120	4116440	about like that?
4116440	4117440	I don't know.
4117440	4118440	It's a major problem.
4118440	4119440	Competition.
4119440	4120440	Like.
4120440	4121440	I'm not kidding at all.
4121440	4122440	It's a major problem.
4122440	4123440	I had a girlfriend once.
4123440	4129960	Like 1999, I had a TV pilot and as a writer, she had a TV pilot at the same network and
4129960	4136600	we saw it coming and I sat her down and was like, look, it's absolutely impossible that
4136600	4139360	both of our pilots are going to go.
4139360	4141720	Hopefully both of our pilots don't go.
4141720	4144480	What if one of our pilots goes and the other one doesn't?
4144480	4147800	Let's consider that possibility now and make some rules.
4147800	4152320	And then in my head, I now, looking back, I realized that when I was having that talk
4152320	4157880	with her, I was only doing it to prepare her for the absolute inevitability that my pilot
4157880	4159640	was going to go and hers wasn't.
4159640	4168440	Her pilot was Malcolm in the middle.
4168440	4171880	Mine was Heat Vision and Jack.
4171880	4173760	And I couldn't fucking handle it.
4173760	4177280	I was like, I'm out of here.
4177280	4182640	So I'm wondering, like, two standups, like, like, do you worry?
4182640	4185080	It's a lot of Malcolm's, it for sure is.
4185080	4186800	Do you guys talk about that?
4186800	4187800	We talk about it all the time.
4187800	4188800	And I've known her.
4188800	4189800	We met doing standups.
4189800	4193080	So I knew, you know, I mean, obviously I knew this was what was always going to happen.
4193080	4198920	I will say the the positive and those of you that have ever seen a real performer, if you
4198920	4201240	know her, she's, I mean, just brilliant.
4201240	4204240	She's a brilliant comic.
4204240	4212840	That was one of our fans who says you up a lot.
4212840	4213840	Is that true?
4213840	4215840	It means he likes it.
4215840	4216840	Great.
4216880	4220880	It's like it's like snarf thundercats.
4220880	4221880	Right.
4221880	4225880	To put it in lesbian terms.
4225880	4229880	Wait, when I met we never say snarf, but we do snarf a lot.
4229880	4235880	When I met when I met Raya, we were wearing the same Wolverine boots.
4235880	4236880	Yeah.
4236880	4239880	And I was like, hey, we're wearing the same boots.
4239880	4240880	Yeah.
4240880	4241880	And she was like, yeah.
4241880	4244880	And we started talking about the care of our boots.
4244920	4249920	And then Karen said, it's like every dude that meets Raya talks about boots.
4249920	4250920	It is.
4250920	4251920	And I was like, oh, shit.
4251920	4253920	Well, do you know what is actually amazing?
4253920	4258920	No, it's actually awesome to see because she is like on the spectrum of human people.
4258920	4260920	She is like real.
4260920	4262920	She's in a real James Dean area.
4262920	4266920	And so, yeah, dudes, I like I felt cool because I was wearing the same.
4266920	4267920	Yeah, exactly.
4267920	4272920	Dude, she's like she's either aspirational for men or men are flirting with her.
4272960	4274960	I was kind of flirting with her.
4274960	4275960	In a homoerotic way.
4275960	4276960	I was.
4276960	4277960	It's like, dude, I can just see.
4277960	4278960	She's also super hot.
4278960	4279960	Yeah.
4279960	4280960	Thank you.
4280960	4281960	She's fucking great looking.
4281960	4282960	Yeah.
4282960	4283960	She's beautiful.
4283960	4284960	She has cool style.
4284960	4285960	You have cool styles.
4285960	4286960	Yeah.
4286960	4287960	Right.
4287960	4288960	We still have to iron out those rules.
4288960	4289960	By the way, I'm trying.
4289960	4290960	I don't know what the etiquette is.
4290960	4291960	Your wife's hot.
4291960	4292960	Yes, she's hot.
4292960	4293960	She's hot.
4293960	4294960	No, that's okay.
4294960	4296960	It still feels like a wild blast.
4296960	4297960	Is that all right?
4297960	4301960	I will say, I mean, yeah, I'll fucking take that all day long.
4302000	4303000	Sure.
4303000	4304000	What an insult.
4304000	4305000	And you vowed to...
4305000	4306000	She wears great boots.
4306000	4307000	How dare you say that?
4307000	4309000	Can I ask you a personal question?
4309000	4310000	Yeah.
4310000	4313000	When you guys are snarfing, how does that work?
4313000	4315000	What does snarfing entail?
4318000	4321000	So, what it is is...
4321000	4322000	Go ahead.
4322000	4326000	We'll be right in the middle of looking into each other's eyes.
4326000	4329000	And then we'll call a dude.
4329000	4330000	Whoever.
4330000	4331000	Any dude.
4331040	4333040	Guy on the street.
4333040	4335040	Our oldest friend.
4335040	4336040	Man on the bus.
4336040	4338040	And he comes over.
4338040	4340040	And then we fuck him.
4340040	4342040	The snarfing?
4342040	4343040	You guys...
4343040	4344040	What is snarfing?
4344040	4348040	I am not going to explain lesbian sex to you.
4348040	4349040	No, wait.
4349040	4353040	There was a lot of you that thought that I was serious.
4353040	4354040	There's been...
4354040	4355040	There may be a...
4355040	4356040	Is snarfing a thing?
4356040	4357040	No!
4357040	4359040	That's the point.
4359080	4363080	Snarfing is a character from Thundercats.
4363080	4367080	Okay, it's that thing, yeah.
4367080	4371080	I was making the joke that all lesbians are into Thundercats.
4371080	4373080	I was making up a new stereotype.
4373080	4375080	And clearly they are.
4375080	4377080	I mean, Chitara, give me a break.
4377080	4379080	Well, I just...
4379080	4380080	You know what?
4380080	4381080	I also have to tell you guys.
4381080	4383080	I just saw Batman vs. Superman.
4383080	4385080	But also don't see it.
4385080	4387080	Like I just saw it a second time.
4387120	4389120	Spoilers don't see it.
4389120	4393120	But I wanted to see it with a group of friends.
4393120	4395120	And then the theater was very full, you know,
4395120	4397120	because it's the opening weekend or whatever.
4397120	4399120	And Wonder Woman.
4399120	4402120	She's in this movie for like two and a half minutes.
4402120	4404120	But I mean, how do we snarf?
4404120	4406120	We go see Wonder Woman.
4406120	4408120	I'm serious.
4408120	4410120	Like she...
4410120	4411120	I mean, and this is...
4411120	4413120	I'm just going to go ahead and spoil this.
4413120	4415120	Like you do see her go like...
4415160	4417160	She's like...
4417160	4419160	I mean, I stood up and it was at the arc light.
4419160	4421160	So that was a real problem.
4421160	4423160	There she is!
4423160	4425160	And then everyone was like...
4425160	4427160	Does she look like sexy Linda Carter?
4427160	4431160	Like 70s, 80s Wonder Woman?
4431160	4433160	She looks like...
4433160	4435160	Does she have high waisted boy shorts on?
4435160	4437160	Because that's my kind of thing.
4437160	4440160	No, she's got like a cool superhero outfit on.
4440160	4442160	It is definitely very short.
4442160	4444160	There's a part where she falls down.
4444200	4445200	Aww.
4445200	4447200	But not...
4447200	4449200	It's because she's fighting so much.
4449200	4451200	She doesn't fall down like bad.
4451200	4453200	But she needs a little help.
4453200	4455200	She kind of slides under like a mechanic.
4455200	4457200	You know, like it's...
4457200	4459200	She slides under the glass ceiling.
4459200	4461200	She slides under the glass ceiling.
4461200	4463200	Which is there for her safety.
4463200	4465200	I know. No, it is...
4465200	4469200	Contrary to all this chatter I'm seeing on the internet.
4469200	4471200	It's for safety.
4471200	4473200	It's like a sneeze guard.
4473200	4475200	The glass ceiling.
4475200	4477200	But going up.
4477200	4479200	It's there for protection.
4479200	4483200	This whole movie is about dudes being so sad.
4483200	4485200	That they're superheroes.
4485200	4487200	It's like two dudes that are like...
4487200	4489200	This is actually where we've...
4489200	4491200	This is the point we've gotten to with
4491200	4493200	Dude focused movies.
4493200	4495200	Where now there's just movies where dudes are like
4495200	4497200	I don't want any of this.
4498200	4501200	You're saying the fan response you mean?
4501200	4503200	I don't want that. No, like the guys on screen.
4503200	4505200	Oh, the guys on screen are doing that.
4505200	4507200	You know them. Their names are Batman and Superman.
4507200	4509200	The whole time they're like
4509200	4511200	I don't want to do it.
4511200	4513200	That's what it looks like in the trailer.
4513200	4515200	That they're like no.
4515200	4517200	You hear Batman's voice and he's going
4517200	4519200	Why is he so super? That's a bad idea.
4519200	4521200	And then Superman's like
4521200	4523200	Cause I gotta be super. I don't have a choice.
4524200	4526200	And also P.S.
4526200	4528200	P.S.
4528200	4530200	Ben Affleck and
4530200	4532200	Is it Henry Cavill? Is that his name?
4532200	4536200	They are so giant in this movie.
4536200	4538200	Like this way.
4538200	4542200	It feels like they stretched the screen.
4542200	4544200	And then they also
4544200	4546200	They're huge this way.
4546200	4548200	And then they were like
4548200	4551200	What will look normal on a man
4551200	4553200	who is
4553200	4557200	Each individual peck is as wide as he is tall.
4557200	4559200	And then somebody was like
4559200	4561200	Oh for Batman? Well when he's not wearing the suit
4561200	4563200	Put him in tweed.
4563200	4566200	And tweed is like such a bulky fabric
4566200	4568200	that Ben Affleck is like trying to
4570200	4572200	walk but he's just catching on fire.
4572200	4574200	Like he can't
4577200	4580200	And so he's just, he can't really move
4580200	4583200	And they're so huge.
4583200	4585200	They're so huge. And then
4585200	4587200	Wonder Woman just, the whole movie is
4587200	4590200	She's like trying to figure out if she's going to be Wonder Woman.
4590200	4591200	I saw it. I saw it.
4591200	4592200	And then she's like
4592200	4594200	Did you see the trailer before you saw the movie?
4594200	4595200	I did.
4595200	4596200	Cause I saw, I went to see Deadpool
4596200	4598200	And I saw the, they played the
4598200	4600200	Oh you put a sock in it.
4600200	4603200	The last time this movie came up I got punched in Miami.
4605200	4607200	But I went to see Deadpool with my girlfriend
4607200	4609200	And they played the trailer before.
4609200	4610200	I heard all this crazy shit.
4610200	4612200	It was like no one's anticipating Batman
4612200	4614200	versus Superman or whatever it's called
4614200	4617200	with well regard.
4617200	4618200	If that's a phrase.
4618200	4620200	Maybe I'm drunk, maybe I'm dying.
4620200	4622200	But I saw the trailer and I was like
4622200	4625200	Oh, this doesn't look that bad.
4625200	4626200	And I was bummed out.
4626200	4628200	And I want to confess why.
4628200	4629200	Because I don't like Ben Affleck.
4629200	4630200	And I never have.
4630200	4632200	And I've never wanted to see him win.
4632200	4634200	Yes, yes.
4634200	4636200	But now I feel twice as bad because now he's down.
4636200	4638200	Have you seen the sad Affleck?
4638200	4639200	Yes.
4639200	4640200	Yes.
4640200	4642200	Now I don't even get to hate him with pleasure
4642200	4643200	because now everyone hates him.
4643200	4645200	I'm like, God damn it, that was my idea.
4645200	4649200	Well, I have always, I've always found,
4649200	4651200	I liked him when he was like,
4651200	4654200	when he was the snot-nosed like douchebag in movies.
4654200	4655200	When he was the one, like for instance,
4655200	4657200	in days I'm confused.
4657200	4658200	Mwah.
4658200	4659200	He's great at that.
4659200	4660200	That's it though.
4660200	4661200	Yeah.
4661200	4662200	That was the end of it.
4662200	4663200	Yes, right.
4663200	4664200	And then it ended.
4664200	4665200	Yeah, in days I'm confused.
4665200	4666200	And he was just a douchebag.
4666200	4670200	Well, cause like Argo is such an insulting movie,
4670200	4672200	I think, to American audiences.
4672200	4674200	And also just to the world because,
4674200	4676200	I don't know if you guys remember when that movie came out,
4676200	4681200	but the end of that movie is that a plane is rolling down the runway
4681200	4682200	and Ben Affleck is like,
4682200	4683200	Get in the car!
4683200	4687200	And they chase the plane in a car.
4687200	4688200	And I remember seeing,
4688200	4689200	because it's based on a true story,
4689200	4690200	I remember seeing it and I was like,
4690200	4693200	Well, this part didn't happen.
4693200	4695200	And then I went home and I looked it up and it did not.
4695200	4697200	Like, there's no car chase.
4697200	4699200	I also don't even believe that the scene where they,
4699200	4701200	that they must have built the movie around,
4701200	4704200	where they explain the storyboards to security.
4704200	4705200	I don't believe that happened either.
4705200	4706200	Because it's like,
4706200	4708200	Oh, is this a Shakespeare in love?
4708200	4709200	Like, what is this?
4709200	4711200	Like, to what extent do they fucking care?
4711200	4713200	It's just like,
4713200	4715200	when you strip those things out that make the story interesting,
4715200	4717200	it's like, well, come on.
4717200	4718200	Well, I feel like when,
4718200	4720200	especially when you're dealing with life and death things,
4720200	4722200	and then you just make it a movie that's like,
4722200	4724200	Argo, fuck yourself.
4724200	4727200	We made up a phrase, it doesn't mean anything.
4727200	4729200	And it's the title of the movie.
4729200	4732200	Like, that, that to me, it was so insulting.
4732200	4734200	And I, I've never recovered.
4734200	4739200	I just, I feel like I'm kicking a guy while he's down.
4739200	4742200	But I also feel like I kept my,
4742200	4745200	Ben Affleck is the only person I've ever seen on screen
4745200	4748200	be frustrated by a mentally challenged person.
4748200	4750200	In what?
4750200	4751200	In How's Your News?
4751200	4752200	Have you ever seen that?
4752200	4754200	Like, like, like there's a person
4754200	4755200	mentally challenged interviewing him.
4755200	4757200	And he's in the, I guess he's well-intended
4757200	4760200	because he's like working at some kind of democratic fundraiser.
4760200	4763200	And, and I think in his head, he's like,
4763200	4766200	why is this person asking me questions about the,
4766200	4768200	the Daredevil movie?
4768200	4770200	And he's like, he, you can see him
4770200	4776200	unlike every rodeo clown and banker and jailer
4776200	4778200	and homeless person that they interview in that movie.
4778200	4780200	Everyone else goes like,
4780200	4782200	that you can see them cross the threshold of like,
4782200	4787200	oh, you're, you're different from me neurologically.
4787200	4788200	And they, and they adjust.
4788200	4791200	And it's a very uplifting documentary
4791200	4793200	that rides the line between exploitation
4793200	4795200	and fucking like the opposite of it,
4795200	4798200	because it's made by caretakers of, you know, blah, blah, blah.
4798200	4800200	But like, I always, ever since I saw that movie,
4800200	4802200	I was like, you're fucking mad at a retarded guy
4802200	4803200	for being retarded.
4803200	4804200	That's crazy.
4804200	4806200	That's so crazy how mad you are at him.
4806200	4807200	That's it.
4807200	4808200	Well,
4809200	4811200	and I've always wanted to see him fail.
4811200	4814200	I think that's a great, you know, um,
4814200	4817200	you, when I was sure this is, I'm sorry,
4817200	4819200	the sad Batman, Ben Affleck.
4819200	4821200	If you're listening,
4821200	4823200	he's not listening.
4823200	4824200	What if he is?
4824200	4826200	What if this is the one,
4826200	4829200	he stopped listening during our airplane.
4829200	4830200	Yes.
4831200	4833200	He's already ducked out.
4833200	4834200	If he was listening.
4834200	4835200	What is this?
4835200	4837200	What is this podcast is the one thing he was coming to?
4837200	4838200	I know.
4838200	4839200	That would be hard.
4839200	4840200	This is not the thing.
4840200	4843200	Do you know, I'm sure there's some people here that,
4843200	4845200	do you know when I was a kid,
4845200	4849200	there was an enrichment program that people did in grade school,
4849200	4851200	and it was called The Voyage of the Mimi,
4851200	4852200	and it was, uh...
4852200	4853200	Mimi?
4853200	4854200	This is great.
4855200	4857200	It was called The Voyage of the Mimi,
4857200	4859200	and you had to stay after school,
4859200	4861200	and you could watch videos about, like,
4861200	4863200	I think they were shipwrecked children
4863200	4865200	who had to problem solve,
4865200	4866200	and Ben Affleck was in this series,
4866200	4868200	and he's, like, 11 years old.
4868200	4870200	Um, so, yes!
4870200	4872200	So, yes!
4872200	4873200	Yes!
4873200	4874200	Now, yes.
4874200	4876200	So you had to, like, pass a test
4876200	4877200	and be, like, a...
4877200	4878200	Be, like, a...
4878200	4881200	You know, like, a sad brainy kid.
4881200	4882200	And then you...
4882200	4883200	And then you could stay after school,
4883200	4884200	and you could watch The Voyage of the Mimi,
4884200	4885200	and they solved...
4885200	4886200	What the fuck?
4886200	4887200	Problems.
4887200	4888200	Like, they solved problems, like,
4888200	4889200	we don't have any water, let's put a tarp out,
4889200	4891200	and then the water will collect on the tarp,
4891200	4892200	and it will go into a glass.
4892200	4894200	You're describing the Illuminati.
4894200	4895200	Yes.
4895200	4899200	Cameron, did that build in a love of Affleck for you?
4899200	4900200	Or, like, did you...
4900200	4901200	Well...
4901200	4903200	Are you predisposed to like Ben Affleck because of that?
4903200	4904200	No, I don't...
4904200	4905200	I mean, I think I'm probably not,
4905200	4906200	but I just mean...
4906200	4908200	Because when you were just saying that, you know, like...
4908200	4909200	Dazed and confused is this, like, you know,
4909200	4911200	kind of young heyday for him.
4911200	4912200	I was like, this guy's a geezer!
4912200	4913200	Because I had been...
4913200	4915200	When he came on the scene, though, you're like,
4915200	4917200	oh, I know this guy since I was, like, a little girl.
4917200	4920200	We came up together, I said.
4920200	4923200	It was me, him, and Menti?
4924200	4928200	Because Dan and Rob and I met him on...
4928200	4930200	What's the...
4930200	4932200	The Matt Day movie?
4932200	4933200	We met Ben Affleck?
4933200	4934200	No, no.
4934200	4937200	Where I first know him is...
4937200	4938200	What's that movie?
4938200	4939200	Good Will Hunting.
4939200	4941200	That's where he comes on the scene for me.
4941200	4943200	Well, you've been sleeping,
4943200	4946200	because that shit was around for a while.
4946200	4950200	I hosted the GQ Men of the Year Awards one year
4950200	4952200	when I was on The Daily Show.
4952200	4954200	And...
4954200	4956200	By the way, I just want to tell you,
4956200	4958200	I was hoping you'd bring that up.
4958200	4963200	That was the only year that award really held...
4963200	4964200	Thank you.
4964200	4966200	Ever since then it's lost its meaning.
4966200	4967200	Thank you.
4967200	4969200	I feel like that was the year...
4969200	4971200	Who were the Men of the Year?
4971200	4973200	That year, that year...
4973200	4975200	Let me answer that question.
4975200	4978200	That year it was the Men of the Year.
4978200	4981200	Ever since then it's been just bullshit.
4982200	4985200	I was doing it for the honor of doing that.
4985200	4987200	Not the money.
4987200	4991200	Not the loads of money they were giving me to do that.
4991200	4993200	I was doing it because that was important to me.
4993200	4996200	You thought that if you hosted Man of the Year...
4996200	5000200	That it would be a ticket to becoming Man of the Year later.
5000200	5001200	Exactly.
5001200	5003200	So I went there and it was the first year
5003200	5006200	that there was a bunch of men of the year.
5006200	5009200	And the Jackass guys were there.
5009200	5014200	And then in the table right in front of me was Al Gore,
5014200	5018200	Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck,
5018200	5022200	and behind Ben Affleck holding him, Jennifer Garner.
5022200	5024200	Holding him from behind.
5024200	5027200	Well, please don't tell me anything negative about Jennifer Garner.
5027200	5028200	No, she was great.
5028200	5030200	She comes out the hero in this story.
5030200	5031200	Oh my God.
5031200	5032200	She's the hero in this story.
5032200	5033200	She looks so good in her wings.
5033200	5034200	Oh, she's the best.
5034200	5036200	She comes out the hero.
5036200	5041200	So I wrote this whole comedy bit with a friend of mine.
5041200	5044200	And he was in the way back of the room with my wife.
5044200	5046200	And it was really funny.
5046200	5048200	I thought it was very, very funny.
5048200	5050200	And then I started...
5050200	5054200	It was like a light roast of all the people there.
5054200	5057200	That's good, right?
5057200	5058200	It was a light roast.
5058200	5061200	Good to see Leonardo DiCaprio is here.
5061200	5064200	He tips 19%.
5064200	5065200	That's exactly what it was.
5065200	5067200	Still way above what you should expect.
5067200	5068200	So I started with...
5068200	5071200	So I see the jackass guys are here.
5071200	5073200	And Steve-O said,
5073200	5075200	Sit down, you shit-ass.
5075200	5081200	So that was my first experience interacting with the audience.
5081200	5084200	So it was immediately out of my element.
5084200	5086200	That's not even a term.
5086200	5089200	He said, Sit down, you shit-ass.
5089200	5091200	I've met Steve-O.
5091200	5093200	The first time I met him, he pulled up his shirt.
5093200	5095200	He's got a tattoo of himself.
5095200	5096200	Yeah.
5096200	5099200	And this was like full-on drug years, Steve-O.
5099200	5102200	He's all sobered up now.
5102200	5105200	Now it's the Constitution.
5105200	5107200	He's become a libertarian.
5107200	5111200	I feel like I'd be able to connect with Steve-O now.
5111200	5112200	That he's silver.
5112200	5115200	And on his back, a map to dry land.
5115200	5117200	And that's controversial, but it's true.
5117200	5121200	So I said he's just starting to get tattoos of other people now.
5122200	5125200	I worked my way up to Ben Affleck.
5125200	5129200	And I said, Ben Affleck is here.
5129200	5132200	And Jen Garner was behind Ben Affleck.
5132200	5135200	And she just started shaking her head out.
5135200	5137200	And he was staring at me.
5137200	5139200	Like staring daggers at me.
5139200	5141200	And Jen Garner's going, Don't.
5141200	5142200	Don't do it.
5142200	5147200	You're causing me six hours of paperwork.
5147200	5150200	You have any respect for me.
5150200	5153200	You will not ruin my weekend.
5153200	5154200	You will not like these apples.
5154200	5157200	I had a bunch of jokes prepared.
5162200	5166200	This guy is an emotional China syndrome.
5166200	5168200	Don't do it for him.
5168200	5170200	And do it for me.
5170200	5174200	So I said, Ben Affleck is here.
5174200	5176200	Ben Affleck and I.
5176200	5180200	The whole front row is in the fetal position.
5180200	5182200	Ben Affleck is here.
5182200	5184200	Ben and I have a lot in common.
5184200	5187200	We're both from Boston.
5187200	5193200	Ben, we both drive Maseratis except for me.
5193200	5196200	That I thought was a really good joke.
5196200	5197200	That's fun.
5197200	5200200	And then I said, this was a terrible joke.
5200200	5205200	I said, and when something like in the moment of climax,
5205200	5209200	we have both called out J. Lowe's name.
5209200	5211200	Oh.
5211200	5214200	Something like that.
5214200	5216200	Just like a general proximity.
5216200	5219200	And Jen Garner's head, she's like whipping herself.
5219200	5221200	She's like, I was protecting him.
5221200	5222200	What the fuck?
5222200	5226200	Giving herself whiplash saying no.
5226200	5231200	And then they excused me from the stage.
5231200	5234200	And Al Gore got up and he said.
5234200	5236200	This is just like Jimmy Carran's story.
5236200	5239200	What the fuck happened right then and there?
5239200	5241200	What do you mean they excused you from the stage?
5241200	5243200	And we never got a straight answer.
5243200	5244200	This is what happened.
5244200	5246200	Will Ferrell was there.
5246200	5254200	And he's the only one laughing at every one of my jokes.
5254200	5259200	He's the only one laughing at full volume.
5259200	5264200	And I don't know whether he was laughing because he thought it was funny
5264200	5268200	or he's laughing because he felt bad for me.
5268200	5273200	And then I left the stage and Al Gore got up.
5273200	5279200	And Al Gore said, Will, we've all suffered Rob Cordry's barbs.
5279200	5280200	What?
5280200	5282200	No, Rob Corduroy.
5282200	5284200	He called me Rob Corduroy.
5284200	5286200	Rob Corduroy's barbs.
5286200	5289200	And that's when I whispered to my wife in the back of the room.
5289200	5291200	I said, start the car.
5291200	5292200	Start the car.
5292200	5296200	And then I got back up and I thanked everybody for being there.
5296200	5299200	And Steve O yelled at me again.
5299200	5304200	And then I walked off the stage and just walked right into my car and went off.
5304200	5306200	I'm sorry, Rob.
5306200	5311200	Because he's so sacred?
5311200	5312200	What's the point?
5312200	5313200	Is it Ben Affleck?
5313200	5315200	Yeah, I guess that's the point.
5315200	5317200	That you are not allowed to make fun of Ben Affleck.
5317200	5319200	No, no, no, no.
5319200	5326200	I made some Leonardo DiCaprio jokes and there was nobody behind Leo going no, no, no.
5326200	5329200	No, it was Jennifer Garner was holding him from behind it.
5329200	5330200	Poor Jennifer Garner.
5330200	5337200	She was like, I know my boyfriend, husband, whatever he was to her, my ward.
5337200	5341200	I know what's coming and I know I've dealt with this.
5341200	5345200	Was it a cerebral palsy benefit and someone made a joke that he didn't understand and
5345200	5351200	it's been three days of fucking bringing him toasted cheese sandwiches and telling him
5351200	5352200	it'll be better.
5352200	5357200	Don't fucking roast this guy if you care about Jennifer Garner's week.
5357200	5359200	That's what was happening.
5359200	5364200	And then his joke accidentally was like on her and she's like, I don't believe it.
5364200	5371200	I really think in general roasting worst worst job of for people you don't have a relationship
5371200	5372200	with.
5372200	5373200	No.
5373200	5375200	Why they do this yet.
5375200	5376200	Why they do this to comics?
5376200	5377200	I will never understand.
5377200	5383200	Like what I mean is when everybody's buddies or let's say it's Donald Trump and he's like,
5383200	5388200	I am benefiting enormously from being on Comedy Central and everybody is going to make fun
5388200	5389200	of me.
5389200	5390200	And I have signed up for this fully.
5390200	5395200	But other than that, I feel like it's just like you're either Tina and Amy or don't do
5395200	5396200	it.
5396200	5397200	Don't do it.
5397200	5398200	The answer is don't do it.
5398200	5399200	Don't do it.
5399200	5400200	Don't do it.
5400200	5401200	These are strangers.
5401200	5402200	I made $35,000.
5402200	5403200	Hey, do it.
5403200	5404200	Do it.
5404200	5405200	Do it.
5405200	5414200	At a time when that was, that was, I was super cool with that.
5414200	5418200	Do you think, do you, do you think you killed print media?
5419200	5421200	That might have been the night that it died.
5421200	5422200	Yes.
5422200	5423200	Yeah.
5423200	5425200	You were like, let's save this magazine.
5425200	5428200	Who can we get on our side?
5428200	5430200	Al Gore and Ben Affleck.
5430200	5434200	Sit down, you shit ass.
5434200	5439200	But don't you, don't you think Jennifer Garner was like holding him back because she thinks
5439200	5441200	like, oh, he's going to kick your ass.
5441200	5442200	No, no.
5442200	5445200	I did a movie with Jennifer Garner right after that.
5445200	5448200	And I was like, fuck, do I talk to her about this?
5448200	5453200	Do I talk to her about this moment that we shared because we shared a moment and she
5453200	5458200	has to know about this moment and we didn't spend one second on it.
5458200	5461200	Wait, what year was this?
5461200	5464200	Oh, five, six years ago.
5464200	5465200	I don't mean to, I do not.
5465200	5467200	The movie was Butter.
5467200	5468200	It was called Butter.
5468200	5469200	Oh, yeah.
5469200	5470200	Well.
5470200	5471200	Oh, thank you.
5471200	5474200	I do not, I do not mean to diminish your role in your life.
5474200	5477200	But I wonder if maybe she just didn't remember.
5477200	5478200	Didn't give a shit.
5478200	5479200	Well, I think maybe she didn't give a shit.
5479200	5481200	Also, I bet like she had a lot of stuff going on.
5481200	5483200	I think she was kind of busy.
5483200	5485200	She had a lot of things.
5485200	5488200	Ben Affleck that hard, that worried.
5488200	5489200	You're right.
5489200	5490200	I know it's going to seem.
5490200	5491200	I probably did not register on her.
5491200	5493200	It's going to seem like we set this up.
5493200	5498200	But what I wanted, I wanted the three of you to do, I brought the script.
5498200	5502200	I wanted the three of you to do the controversial scene from Butter.
5502200	5504200	Oh, shit.
5504200	5506200	The fair, the Butter fair scene?
5506200	5508200	The director's cut, the director cut.
5508200	5509200	Okay.
5509200	5510200	Okay, so.
5510200	5512200	Guys, it's a campfire scene.
5512200	5514200	I finally finished it.
5514200	5520200	This is my sculpture of a Monopoly board made out of butter.
5520200	5523200	Listen, it's pretty hot out.
5523200	5524200	And it's.
5524200	5525200	Bread!
5525200	5538200	Time to get some bread in here, I was going to say.
5538200	5542200	Then bread fell from the sky.
5542200	5545200	Yeah.
5545200	5551200	You set this whole thing up.
5551200	5554200	That's thunder.
5554200	5559200	You brought me here to an outside butter tournament to set up this Monopoly board.
5559200	5563200	Just to drop bread from the ceiling in the middle of a thunderstorm.
5563200	5567200	Typical romance.
5567200	5569200	I don't know why they cut the scene.
5569200	5570200	I don't.
5570200	5572200	That seems like a great scene.
5572200	5574200	They cut that for time or what?
5574200	5575200	I guess it was.
5575200	5576200	Yeah.
5576200	5578200	The World Trade Center was in the background.
5578200	5581200	Yeah, it happened.
5581200	5582200	For no reason.
5582200	5585200	About around 9-11.
5585200	5589200	Cameron, have you ever been hired or asked to roast other people?
5589200	5594200	Not for 35 Gs.
5594200	5595200	Yeah.
5595200	5596200	No.
5596200	5601200	I'm kind of smiley, so I think people don't think I can do it.
5601200	5602200	Those people are wrong.
5602200	5603200	I'm so mean.
5603200	5605200	Guys, let's roast each other.
5605200	5607200	All right.
5607200	5608200	Holy shit.
5608200	5612200	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Harman Town.
5612200	5613200	I don't like this.
5613200	5614200	Roast.
5614200	5616200	I don't like this.
5616200	5617200	I don't like this.
5617200	5618200	The Roastware.
5618200	5624200	Spencer is the Roastmaster General over here.
5624200	5626200	What is a Roastmaster General?
5626200	5630200	You're the Roastmaster General, which means you get to run the proceedings.
5630200	5632200	All right.
5632200	5636200	Go.
5636200	5637200	All right.
5637200	5640200	Do you want to say who roasts, whom?
5640200	5641200	No.
5641200	5642200	All right.
5642200	5645200	Do you want to be the Roastmaster General?
5645200	5647200	No, we haven't spoken to you for a while.
5647200	5648200	You've been sitting over there.
5648200	5649200	No, it's all good.
5649200	5656200	I don't have very much input on movies or comedy routines or famous people or experiences
5656200	5657200	with them.
5657200	5659200	I just, you know, it's all good.
5659200	5662200	If I had things to contribute, you know what.
5662200	5666200	All right, let's talk about ISIS.
5667200	5669200	Well, there's only one thing you want to know.
5669200	5670200	That's roast ISIS.
5670200	5674200	Well, we've been really pulling together a new plot that I think is going to just surprise
5674200	5675200	everybody.
5675200	5676200	You're an ISIS?
5676200	5677200	No.
5677200	5678200	D'oh?
5682200	5688200	Subscribe to HarmanTown.com slash live to see my dough face.
5688200	5689200	I can roast you guys.
5689200	5691200	I can roast you guys so much.
5691200	5692200	All right.
5692200	5693200	We need a Roastmaster General that's going to bring people up.
5693200	5694200	You would be burned up.
5694200	5695200	I want to be burned up.
5695200	5698200	From when I'm going to roast you, you're going to get hot.
5698200	5699200	Give it.
5699200	5703200	You're going to get so crispy, your skin is going to get blistered.
5703200	5708200	Hey, Esposito, save your roast for when the roast starts.
5708200	5711200	I'm trash talking in advance.
5711200	5714200	Oh, you boys are not even going to know.
5714200	5717200	When I start to talk, you are going to listen to me.
5719200	5720200	All right, everybody.
5720200	5724200	Welcome to the first annual HarmanTown Roast.
5726200	5730200	Where nobody's safe from being roasted in any moment.
5730200	5732200	The roaster can become the roaster.
5732200	5733200	Wait, wait, wait.
5733200	5735200	Is Jimmy Crane still here?
5735200	5738200	Let's sit Jimmy Crane in a shorter chair.
5738200	5739200	Is Jimmy Crane still here?
5739200	5742200	Down in the center of the stage, and let's roast Jimmy Crane.
5742200	5743200	No, wait.
5743200	5745200	You're just trying to get out of being roasted.
5745200	5746200	Is there more here?
5746200	5747200	Oh, no.
5747200	5748200	You can roast me.
5748200	5750200	I just thought it'd be funny if it was the third party, because that's how roasts work.
5750200	5753200	Let's bring out Jimmy Crane again to possibly get roasted.
5753200	5754200	Just put it like...
5754200	5755200	Oh, yeah.
5755200	5756200	Okay.
5756200	5757200	You were doing it right.
5757200	5758200	You were doing it right.
5758200	5759200	Okay.
5759200	5760200	There we go.
5760200	5761200	Okay.
5763200	5764200	Okay.
5764200	5765200	Go ahead, Jeff.
5765200	5766200	Jeff, it's the Jimmy Crane roast.
5766200	5767200	All right, Jimmy Crane.
5767200	5768200	Yes.
5768200	5769200	Hello.
5769200	5771200	I'm Jeff Davis, your host.
5771200	5773200	We got Jimmy Crane out here.
5773200	5777200	He told a story about trying to commit suicide on a plane earlier.
5777200	5782200	You know, a lot of people would be Guantanamo for that.
5783200	5784200	I like Jimmy Crane.
5784200	5786200	Here's somebody who hates Jimmy Crane.
5786200	5789200	Cameron Esposito, everybody.
5793200	5795200	Oh, Jimmy Crane.
5795200	5799200	I known you for years, because we both spent time in Chicago.
5799200	5801200	What a city.
5803200	5808200	It is full of food, and you will eat it if you are hungry.
5808200	5812200	Just like everyone else, you are so good at improv that you teach classes,
5812200	5816200	and you make people pay you, you very greedy man.
5816200	5819200	Oh, shit.
5819200	5822200	Cameron Esposito, everybody.
5822200	5823200	Cameron Esposito.
5823200	5824200	Bring it up.
5824200	5825200	You like him.
5825200	5826200	He's bald.
5826200	5827200	His name is Rob.
5827200	5830200	His name is Dan Harmon.
5831200	5841200	I would have come here earlier, but Roseanne Barr's pussy had that horn in it.
5848200	5850200	Good job, Cameron Esposito.
5850200	5858200	Hey, your lesbian called the 90s once, back that wants to get the lesbianism back.
5860200	5861200	No, she's great.
5861200	5863200	I kid Cameron Esposito.
5863200	5868200	I kid her because I'm opposed to her lifestyle.
5873200	5879200	I'm not going to say Cameron Esposito is a lesbian, but when she goes out,
5879200	5881200	she goes out with a woman.
5887200	5888200	Too soon.
5888200	5889200	Too soon.
5889200	5900200	But we are here to talk about the legend Jimmy Careen, the man, the legend,
5900200	5904200	the fucking horrible monster.
5905200	5908200	Folks, it's not fair.
5908200	5912200	I know a lot of people say Jimmy Careen is a piece of shit.
5912200	5914200	He's a terrible person.
5914200	5916200	He should kill himself.
5919200	5921200	What else is going on?
5924200	5926200	Dan Harmon, everybody.
5926200	5928200	Oh, shit.
5931200	5932200	Let's bring out.
5932200	5934200	You know him.
5934200	5936200	You know him, he loves him.
5936200	5938200	He's the less famous Cordray.
5938200	5940200	Rob Cordray.
5942200	5944200	Oh, man.
5944200	5946200	Amy Schumer's not here.
5947200	5949200	But she's a slut, right?
5952200	5955200	And then there's the other guys, the Roastmaster General.
5955200	5956200	He's fat.
5957200	5963200	And then there's all the guys that Dan mentioned.
5963200	5967200	And then Cameron's a lesbian.
5968200	5971200	And then Trob is bald as fuck.
5972200	5976200	He doesn't even know he's been bald since he was 19.
5976200	5977200	It's like...
5981200	5982200	Fuck.
5983200	5986200	And then there's the guy, Jimmy.
5986200	5997200	I really respect him because he's a guy that is sort of a luminary in the improv community.
5997200	5998200	Oh, shit.
5998200	6000200	That was Rob Cordray, everybody.
6001200	6003200	Damn.
6003200	6004200	Damn.
6004200	6005200	Wait.
6005200	6009200	I really need a rebuttal because I didn't realize I was supposed to cover everyone.
6009200	6011200	Oh, shit.
6011200	6012200	Oh, shit.
6019200	6020200	Hang on. Hang on.
6028200	6029200	Wait. I forgot.
6032200	6035200	He's got to update his iPad here.
6037200	6038200	Hold on.
6038200	6042200	I'm not saying Cameron Esposito doesn't understand roasts.
6043200	6048200	But when she goes to TGI Fridays, she orders the, uh...
6048200	6049200	You know what's better than this?
6049200	6053200	Let's bring out Rob Schwab, everybody. Rob Schwab.
6053200	6054200	Rob.
6059200	6062200	I'm so sad all the time.
6063200	6064200	Oh, God.
6064200	6066200	I stepped on a nail.
6069200	6070200	My foot hurts.
6070200	6071200	It hurts so bad.
6074200	6076200	You all seem like really nice people.
6077200	6079200	I don't understand the point of this.
6079200	6082200	Oh, it's bleeding really bad right now.
6083200	6085200	This nail, I stepped on a nail.
6087200	6089200	I didn't see it was really dark backstage.
6089200	6091200	It went right through my shoe.
6094200	6096200	Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.
6096200	6097200	It really hurts.
6097200	6098200	Rob. Rob. Rob.
6098200	6102200	I had to walk on it just to get the podium so far away from the edge of the stage.
6102200	6104200	Rob, you're supposed to make fun of Cameron.
6104200	6106200	Are you Jimmy or anybody else?
6106200	6109200	You could be taller, I guess.
6114200	6115200	Seriously.
6116200	6117200	Rob.
6117200	6118200	You're not supposed to pull it out.
6118200	6119200	Rob. Rob. Rob.
6119200	6121200	I heard you're not supposed to pull it out.
6121200	6122200	It makes it bleed.
6122200	6123200	Rob, work the dais.
6123200	6125200	Work the dais right now.
6126200	6127200	Oh, my God.
6127200	6128200	I'm losing a lot of blood here.
6130200	6131200	Hello, Cordri.
6132200	6133200	Oh, shit.
6135200	6137200	Nice shirt, I guess.
6137200	6138200	It could be...
6139200	6140200	It actually is a nice shirt.
6140200	6141200	It is.
6141200	6142200	What the fuck's going on?
6142200	6144200	Yeah, it's great, okay.
6144200	6146200	Dan, you smell like piss and...
6153200	6154200	Shit.
6154200	6155200	Fuck.
6155200	6156200	Oh, my God.
6157200	6159200	This nail in my foot really hurts.
6159200	6162200	It might be one of those, like, drywall screws with me.
6162200	6164200	All right, let's see what I've done.
6164200	6165200	Oh, my God.
6165200	6166200	Call my wife.
6167200	6168200	Call my wife.
6168200	6170200	Please call my wife.
6170200	6171200	Let's hear it.
6171200	6172200	I can't.
6172200	6174200	Somebody help me walk off stage.
6174200	6175200	Let's bring it out.
6175200	6178200	Somebody help me walk off stage is only going to make it worse walking on stage.
6178200	6183200	Against normal roast protocol for an early rebuttal, Cameron Esposito.
6183200	6185200	Even though it's not her roast.
6188200	6190200	Yes, exactly.
6190200	6195200	Well, the whole team now, you're lined up and you're ready for these things.
6202200	6205200	Spencer Pittman, everybody.
6205200	6207200	Spencer Pittman.
6211200	6212200	Spencer Pittman.
6212200	6213200	No hard feelings.
6213200	6214200	No hard feelings.
6215200	6216200	Wait, where is he going?
6216200	6217200	Where is he going?
6217200	6218200	Sit the fuck down.
6218200	6219200	You can't fucking leave.
6219200	6220200	Sit the fuck down.
6220200	6221200	He really liked the joke.
6221200	6224200	I will say when the roast is over.
6224200	6225200	He loves the roast.
6225200	6226200	I want a second rebuttal.
6226200	6227200	Second rebuttal.
6227200	6228200	Second rebuttal.
6229200	6230200	Cameron Esposito.
6230200	6232200	Back for rebuttal number two, everybody.
6237200	6239200	I should get a tourniquet or something.
6241200	6243200	Somebody turn his laugh mic off.
6244200	6246200	My toes are turning purple.
6248200	6253200	Dan, I'm not saying that you didn't make Malcolm in the middle.
6254200	6260200	But you made a whole other show that was equally beloved.
6264200	6269200	But a different group of people than that other show.
6269200	6271200	The two shows are for a different audience.
6271200	6274200	And I think you were being too competitive.
6274200	6277200	So I don't think you need to worry about it.
6277200	6280200	And it seems like you still have enough money.
6283200	6284200	To live.
6284200	6286200	So I think I'm getting blocked.
6286200	6287200	Lock, draw.
6290200	6291200	That can't be good, right?
6294200	6297200	Somebody should sweep up back there.
6298200	6299200	Nails.
6300200	6302200	Cameron Esposito's rebuttal number three.
6305200	6306200	Shit.
6306200	6308200	This is three of seven, Cameron.
6308200	6309200	Three of seven.
6309200	6310200	Yeah, you got it.
6311200	6315200	Rob, I'm not saying that you are particularly good at Twitter,
6315200	6319200	but everybody made your name into a verb.
6321200	6323200	So shut up.
6323200	6325200	Fuck you, Shrob.
6325200	6328200	Your name isn't even your name anymore.
6328200	6330200	It's a whole other thing.
6330200	6334200	And you did it with your own success.
6335200	6337200	That was so nice.
6337200	6339200	Look at Dan's face.
6339200	6341200	Look at the face dance I'm making right now.
6341200	6343200	He looks so mad.
6343200	6345200	He looks so mad.
6347200	6348200	This is a nice approach.
6348200	6349200	Oh, shit.
6351200	6353200	It's a Jimmy Crane, a realist moment.
6357200	6360200	We got some band-aids for Rob Shrob right now.
6364200	6366200	A little pop comedy, everybody.
6368200	6370200	It's not a joke. It really hurts.
6371200	6372200	It's probably sanitized.
6372200	6375200	Spencer Crittenden moment, one-liner.
6376200	6378200	Yeah!
6379200	6380200	You still got it.
6381200	6382200	But seriously,
6383200	6385200	Jimmy, you've taken a lot of abuse tonight.
6385200	6389200	It's only fair that we let you rebut.
6390200	6393200	It's fair for the man of the hour, Jimmy Crane, everyone.
6397200	6401200	Thank you.
6402200	6404200	Oh, yay!
6405200	6406200	Shit!
6407200	6408200	Wait, wait, wait.
6408200	6410200	I have one more rebuttal.
6410200	6411200	Somebody call an ambulance.
6412200	6415200	Camera-net-posito!
6418200	6420200	Well, okay, Rob Cordy.
6420200	6422200	You are next to me.
6423200	6424200	Get back.
6424200	6429200	Get further away, because you're going to be so sad.
6429200	6432200	When you cry, I don't want to see it.
6432200	6435200	So what I'm trying to say to you is,
6435200	6439200	it's almost like you are smart enough to figure out
6439200	6442200	how to create a television show that is successful,
6442200	6444200	but you aren't even recognizable from it,
6444200	6449200	so you can still go a bunch of places and live a good life.
6450200	6456200	Which is an interesting and cool business decision, you dumb person.
6457200	6459200	She's letting me have it right now.
6459200	6463200	What people don't know is that this rebuttal by her is actually like 10 minutes long.
6463200	6466200	There's no musical sting going to save her from this one.
6466200	6468200	This is a long piece.
6468200	6470200	This whole rebuttal?
6470200	6471200	I have been to...
6472200	6474200	I was kidding!
6475200	6476200	Alright, come on.
6476200	6478200	I want to go again.
6480200	6484200	If everybody gets to go again, I want to go again.
6484200	6485200	Oh, boy.
6486200	6487200	Fuckin'...
6487200	6489200	Harmon, are you sure this is a good idea, man?
6489200	6490200	Let me go.
6490200	6491200	You seem like...
6491200	6492200	I don't know what I mean.
6492200	6493200	You're good, Rose.
6493200	6494200	We could just...
6494200	6496200	Dan, we could just end the show right here.
6496200	6497200	It's been a good show.
6497200	6499200	I was told the show would be over by 9.30.
6499200	6500200	Oh, you can end the show, you know,
6500200	6502200	and the show, everything's about the show,
6502200	6504200	but nothing's about the entertainment.
6505200	6508200	If you don't let me roast these people,
6508200	6511200	you're against entertainment.
6511200	6514200	In my day, people roasted.
6515200	6517200	They turned up the heat.
6519200	6523200	Johnny Carson called Sammy Davis, Jr. a faggot.
6525200	6528200	Sammy Davis called Johnny Carson a homo.
6529200	6531200	Everybody be gay.
6532200	6534200	It was fun.
6536200	6540200	Now it's become all about the political correct.
6541200	6543200	I'll tell you what's correct.
6544200	6547200	Politically, it's gay.
6548200	6554200	Straight B values you, faggot.
6556200	6558200	Yeah, let's keep saying that.
6561200	6562200	Let's get in again.
6562200	6564200	It's good to see everybody up here.
6564200	6566200	You're all queer.
6570200	6575200	Now, I served for three years in the candidacy
6575200	6578200	under the Roasty's administration.
6578200	6580200	That's the conceit of my bit.
6581200	6583200	And there were two rules.
6583200	6585200	Be gay.
6585200	6591200	And whoop, whoop.
6591200	6594200	It's always good to see Rob Schwab here.
6596200	6598200	Gay.
6598200	6599200	Yeah, yeah.
6599200	6600200	End the show.
6600200	6602200	I'm really in a lot of pain.
6604200	6605200	Rob Corden's here.
6605200	6607200	Rob Schwab is really in a lot of pain.
6607200	6609200	We should end the show.
6609200	6611200	He's really fucked up right now.
6611200	6613200	He's a nail right in the nerve.
6613200	6614200	Right in the nerve.
6614200	6616200	He's got a nail right through his foot.
6616200	6617200	Foot nerve.
6617200	6618200	It's not a joke.
6618200	6619200	No.
6619200	6620200	It's not a joke.
6620200	6621200	Right in the palm.
6621200	6624200	I will say, it's a little apropos at Big Easter Sunday.
6624200	6625200	No, not funny.
6631200	6635200	Thank you for coming to Hamilton, everybody.
6636200	6638200	We're not going to follow that shit with anything.
6640200	6642200	Let's hear it for Jimmy Careen.
6642200	6644200	Rob Schwab.
6644200	6646200	Spencer Crichton.
6646200	6648200	Cameron Esposito.
6648200	6650200	Rob Corden.
6654200	6658200	Jamarj Brown is in the green room.
6658200	6660200	Bring Jamarj Brown out right now.
6660200	6661200	The show is over.
6661200	6663200	Jamarj Brown.
6666200	6667200	No, no.
6667200	6669200	Get out there, Jamarj.
6669200	6671200	Follow that shit, Jamarj.
6672200	6674200	Jamarj, come on, roast everybody.
6674200	6675200	Roast us.
6675200	6676200	Roast us.
6676200	6677200	All right.
6677200	6678200	For the final word.
6680200	6682200	He's got his own mic.
6684200	6685200	Jeff Davis.
6685200	6687200	It's good to see you here.
6687200	6688200	Lady Elaine Fairchild called.
6688200	6690200	She wants her whole fucking vibe back.
6695200	6696200	Whoa.
6696200	6697200	Whoa.
6697200	6699200	No, no, no, no.
6699200	6700200	No, no, no.
6700200	6702200	No, no, no.
6702200	6703200	Jamarj.
6703200	6704200	Jamarj.
6704200	6705200	Jamarj.
6707200	6709200	Cameron Esposito is here.
6709200	6711200	Pinky Descadero called and she said,
6711200	6716200	hello, and on that I'm going to say good night,
6716200	6717200	we all have got to go.
6719200	6721200	Let's hear it for Hamilton, everybody.
6721200	6722200	Thank you for coming.
6722200	6724200	Jamarj Brown, Rob Corden, Rob Schwab,
6724200	6727200	Cameron, Jimmy Careen, Spencer Crichton,
6727200	6728200	who didn't speak a whole lot, but we love him.
6729200	6730200	Just as much.
6731200	6734200	Jamarj again one more time, Mr. Dan Harmon, everybody.
6738200	6740200	It was the roastiest of roasts.
6742200	6743200	Did you get any of that?
6744200	6746200	It's a good show.
