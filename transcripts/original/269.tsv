0	29080	Let's bring up the man, the game master, Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
29080	41360	And the mayor of Harmentown, Dan Harmon.
41360	56800	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, my beats are cold, my mama is old, still went to bed with her
56800	57800	yesterday.
57800	64320	Yo, I fucked her, what am I, I don't even kind of lost already, fucking my own mom.
64320	65480	Your heart's not even in it.
65480	66480	Yeah.
66480	68620	I thought I misheard you, but yeah, you're fucking your own mom.
68620	74520	If you could fuck anybody's mom, like think of it throughout history, whose mom would
74520	75520	you fuck?
75520	79080	All right, yours.
79080	92040	Yo, Ben Franklin's mom was out on the lawn when he was flying his kite, but I brought
92040	93040	her indoors.
93040	97640	I said, who needs electricity when we're fucking?
97640	98640	I don't know.
98640	103800	Yeah, I just, it doesn't really, uh, what if you, what if you could get fucked by anybody's
103800	104800	mom?
104800	108240	Let's say the mom was doing the fucking on you.
108240	112800	Like famous mom, a famous mom just chose you.
112800	113800	You're the target.
113800	117880	Yo, Mrs. Whistler, why are you fucking me so hard?
117880	120280	It's only one famous mother ever.
120280	123760	Uh, all right, let's, let's cut it.
123760	128700	We're not going to, the only thing worse than a low energy show is a, is a forced resistance
128700	131640	to a low energy show with a terrible rap.
131640	135720	I can't believe you only think there's only one famous mother.
135720	136920	Name another famous mother.
136920	145960	Mrs. Doubtfire, the original Mrs. C from a happy days start the beat again.
145960	150960	And let's say you're getting fucked by Mrs. Cunningham from happy days or you're fucking
150960	152400	anybody in happy days.
152400	153400	Hit the beat.
153400	154400	Wait.
154400	155400	I'm Dan.
155400	166240	Don't fight me on this.
166240	175840	Mrs. Cunningham, C U N N I G I G H A M. Say it again, spell it one more time.
175840	185080	Mrs. Cunningham, C U N N I G I H G I G I M Mrs. Cunningham.
185080	188480	I make a stunning ham for Thanksgiving and make more than that.
188480	195000	I'm always in the kitchen with a clit the size of a bat.
195000	201080	It might be a penis.
201080	213480	I might have a dick when it's, when we're getting to that size and I don't know why.
213480	217520	Are you saying that Mary and Ross has a clit the size of a bat?
217520	220600	No, it's the character or the character Mrs. Cunningham.
220600	221600	Yeah.
221600	222600	All right.
222600	224280	We've had enough like that.
224280	225280	Thank you.
225280	226280	Yeah.
226280	227280	It's not.
227280	228280	We've had enough.
228280	230360	The raps not getting better as the suggestions get harder.
230360	231360	It kind of was.
231360	232360	It kind of was.
232360	233360	All right.
233360	235640	No, I'm not saying we should continue, but that was great.
235640	237640	That was fucking, that was inflammatory.
237640	238640	Yeah.
238640	239640	Oh no.
239640	240640	Yeah.
240640	241640	It got bad.
241640	242640	It got problematic.
242640	244800	So I don't, when I'm at this energy level, we don't want to like force me to do tricks
244800	248400	because then I'm going to end up like, I'll be, I'll say the N word before the night's
248400	249400	over.
249400	250400	What is the point?
250400	252640	The resistance.
252640	255880	The whole point of the genre is to break boundaries.
255880	260040	I know, but it's not, no, no.
260040	264240	That's what you said before I played the Chevy Chase voicemail and that just didn't help
264240	265240	anyone.
265240	268600	So what I said before I played the Chevy Chase voicemail is Dan, do you want, want to play
268600	269600	it off my phone?
269600	270600	Cause I can plug it in over here.
270600	275760	Uh, you guys didn't have plugs back then, come on.
275760	280320	So anyways, I mean, there's nothing, there's nothing to get to, there's no show to do.
280320	282840	I was thinking we might play D and D for like two hours tonight.
282840	283840	Let's do it.
283840	286600	I'm just not feeling, you know, part of it is the video game brain.
286600	289360	Like I was playing, I've been having a good time at home.
289360	290360	I played video games.
290360	291360	I played Star Wars Battlefront.
291360	292360	Oh yeah.
292360	293360	I was thinking about that one.
293360	294360	So good, man.
294360	295360	It's really fun.
295360	296360	Oh yeah.
296360	299560	Like, like reminds me, um, what was the name?
299560	303760	You're probably too young even to remember like, yeah, there was an original, there was
303760	309300	like a game that was, I think it was dark forces, um, where you're like a dude that's
309300	310700	like a Jedi.
310700	313460	You're not Luke Skywalker, but you're just like this dude that's a Jedi.
313460	316980	And there's like, say what Kyle Katarn.
316980	317980	That's the care.
317980	318980	Oh, Kyle Katarn is the name of the dude.
318980	319980	Um, force rising.
319980	320980	Yeah.
320980	326020	It was like a, it was like one of my first PC, uh, games and it was like on a CD-ROM
326020	332140	and it had like all this shitty video, excuse me, video footage of like, you know, actors
332140	336260	that were probably getting like $300 to be covered in prosthetics against green screens
336260	341820	and like come out and like the cut scenes were all video, um, that was a special era
341820	346220	in gaming, but it was a really good game because it was like, it was, I think that was like
346220	351980	the first time you ever got to like, you know, first person shooter from Lucasfilm.
351980	356580	You were like using a lightsaber and you were like leveling up these force powers.
356580	362340	So this game is, it's not, it's not, the focus isn't on that or as I only played like the
362340	367660	first third of it or something, like, but, um, you're like this woman who's a special
367660	369580	forces storm trooper.
369580	370580	It's really cool.
370580	375020	Um, it's just the gameplay is like a really nice balance of like, you can just dick around
375020	379820	and like jump and fucking shoot and like, it's, it just splits the perfect difference
379820	384500	between like games where like Wolfenstein two, like I'm 44.
384500	388820	So I just opened Wolfenstein two and I was like, I played a couple levels and I'm like,
388820	392900	this is cool, but it's not, I'm never going to enjoy this game because it's just going
392900	395420	to be like running and gunning and I'm never going to be good.
395420	400460	And I'm always going to be bummed out and, and anxious, but, and then there's on the
400460	404580	other side of the spectrum, there's like games that are so role play that you're just like
404580	408300	walking around, having conversations with people and you kind of get bored, but like
408300	411260	right in the middle there, it's really nice, really good gameplay.
411260	416060	You just like, I like those, I like those shooters where like, yeah, you touch the left
416060	419740	trigger and it, if you're close enough to the person's head, it like zooms in on their
419740	422620	head and you, you shoot them in the head.
422620	426980	This probably isn't an appropriate time in our nation's history to know it's great.
426980	434940	But I mean, I should probably wait six days and play the market and hope that we're seven
434940	438580	days from a mass shooting, no shootings will happen.
438580	443260	But anyways, it's a really good game start out that battlefront, battlefront two, I recommend
443260	445460	it.
445460	446980	What platform is it on?
446980	449420	I've been playing, I'm playing it on my Xbox.
449420	451780	I don't know what it's, what it's all on.
451780	456780	And then I, and then another game that I saw, I've stayed up all night playing that.
456780	463740	And then, the game that I played all day today was Portal Knights.
463740	465060	Have you heard of Portal Knights?
465060	466060	No.
466060	474060	It's like, it's like somebody looked at Minecraft and thought this isn't, this isn't comfy enough.
474060	480060	Like it's very, it's like a very like polished like adventurey RPG kind of Minecraft thing.
480060	481060	Oh yeah.
481060	482060	Okay.
482060	483060	That's cool.
483060	487700	It's, it's, I got, I got sucked in pretty hard.
487700	492020	And so, and, and so because I had a good time playing video games today, I'm not, it does
492020	493020	something to your brain.
493020	497460	Like it fucks up your alpha waves or something like you, you're not a, you never play video
497460	498460	games like that.
498460	499460	Jeff hates that.
499460	503940	Well, I mean, the only games I really liked was the first person shooter like historical
503940	507420	ones like Call of Duties and the Medal of Honors and stuff.
507420	508420	You'd love Battlefront.
508420	509420	Battlefront?
509420	510420	Yeah.
510420	511920	You probably would like Battlefront.
511920	514940	Here's the thing that's great about the Star Wars games when they're done right.
514940	518820	There's a bunch of shitty ones because there's a bunch of Lucasfilm games, but the really
518820	519820	good ones.
519820	520820	It's so cool.
520820	524340	Just the, having the John Williams score playing while you're playing a shooter.
524340	528820	And especially if it's like a good enough game that it like kind of, it comes in and
528820	529820	out.
529820	534220	Well, it uses the music to like, like, you know, like when you aggro a stormtrooper,
534220	539860	it's like turns into a little, and then, and then like you finish shooting all the storm
539860	544140	troopers in the area and it kind of just like very gracefully goes into this, like more
544140	545140	wistful.
545140	550820	You know, I've been playing, I've been playing chess with friends.
550820	553780	Oh, I've been seeing some of your moves.
553780	554780	Chess with friends?
554780	557620	It's like, it's like words with friends, but it's chess.
557620	561580	And I was at the drawing room and a cat comes up to me and he goes, he saw me sitting there
561580	566620	playing chess with somebody else, like on my phone, and he's a Harman town fan.
566620	567940	His name escapes me.
567940	572380	His name is like online, something like Cap Slapper, Slappy Clappy, Slapping Cap.
572380	576660	And I'm going to beat that motherfucker.
576660	580060	I was playing that for a little bit, but it just takes so long.
580060	581060	It's like chess by mail.
581060	583340	Well, yeah, it depends when you're playing.
583340	587860	Some people play really fast, you know, but like, I don't want to have to play like speed
587860	588860	chess with somebody.
588860	589860	Yeah, for sure.
589860	590860	Yeah.
590860	595140	I would need, I would need it to be a zero sum speed chess.
595140	601900	Even if I, even if I could remember how, how all the horses move, like, which I can't,
601900	605500	I would have to have it be speed chess and I would always lose, but I would at least
605500	611660	need the excuse to like make a move because my understanding of chess is like, well, theoretically
611660	613620	you could sit there forever.
613620	617420	Like, so why wouldn't you like chess freaks me out?
617420	621180	Well, the people I play attended, like a few of the people I play are from the drawing
621180	622180	room.
622180	625140	And so I can tell when somebody's drunk when they're playing me because they make a bullshit
625140	628780	move and they also know when I'm drunk and I've made a bullshit move.
628780	630660	And sometimes I go, I want to win this one.
630660	635380	I'm going to go to sleep and I'm going to play them in the morning and it's, it's improving
635380	636380	my brain.
637380	641780	I haven't made a note of anything at all.
641780	646700	My contentment and also my kind of like, you know, it's part contentment and part, like,
646700	648700	I just don't like the world anymore.
648700	649700	I don't trust people.
649700	652940	I don't, I don't have faith in humanity anymore.
652940	659300	So I kind of just, let's see if I did bother to write anything down throughout the week.
659300	662180	I can feel the subscriptions dropping, which is fine.
662180	665180	That's, that's, that's democracy.
666180	670980	When you said Mrs. C's clit was the size of a bat, were you talking about baseball bat
670980	674780	like Louisville slugger, or are you talking about like a, like a, like a fruit bat?
674780	675780	No, no.
675780	681340	I meant to like a stick, a big long stick.
681340	684180	That's pretty big.
684180	690580	Let's say you were on a date with Mrs. Cunningham and you lifted up her skirt and you saw her
690580	691580	clip.
691580	695900	Would you rather it be the size of a baseball bat or would, or did you want it to look exactly
695900	697780	like a, like a vampire bat?
697780	700980	I don't, I don't want, I mean, I don't, I don't know if this is going to go over well.
700980	703020	I don't, I don't want, I'm giving you the choice.
703020	710300	I don't want, if you're a woman listener, a subscriber and you have an enlarged clitoris,
710300	714420	I don't want you to, I'm not, you should feel good about yourself.
714420	719740	I have all kinds of things about my body that I, you can take or leave, but I'm, you're
719740	720860	asking me the question.
720860	726020	I don't, I don't want a giant, um, I don't want a clitoris that's bigger than my penis
726020	727180	on a woman.
727180	728180	That's silly.
728180	729180	Would you be more credible?
729180	730180	That basically is a penis.
730180	734660	What if, what if, what if her clitoris looked like a bat, like a, like a, like a fruit bat
734660	737380	or a vampire bat, like it looked like a Batman.
737380	739260	So, I mean, that would be crazy.
739260	741660	That would be, that would be distracting and crazy.
741660	743660	I mean, you know that.
743660	744660	I'm giving you the choice.
744660	748540	I'm saying you, you got to, you know, you're trying to help the show, but I'm trying to
748620	753940	ask a journalistic question, Dan, that I think a lot of people want to know the answer to.
753940	758500	What does Dan Harmon feel about baseball bat clips or fruit bat clips?
758500	760740	I don't know, it's the same, same way on both counts.
760740	766180	Just you know what, uh, as politically, uh, uh, unfashionable as it is right now, I'll
766180	771740	just go ahead and say it because I'm being asked the question, uh, anomalous clitoris,
771740	776100	uh, all right, give me a beat.
776100	777100	Yo.
777100	789020	Zach, I got high hopes for this one, yo, yo, right about now, it's time for anomalous
789020	790020	clitoris.
790020	792540	Bring him to the stage.
792540	793540	Hello.
793540	794540	Hello.
794540	805940	I'm anomalous clitoris, I'm here to say I'm making a big scene today.
805940	811020	I'm a new kind of rapper that you've never seen.
811020	815100	Anomalous clitoris is not where you've been and if you don't like things that are new
815100	820820	then you need to step aside because the world's getting smaller and the clitoris is getting
820820	821820	wide.
821820	830660	Anomalous, a clitoris, it's not the clitoris that you can predict, but that's why the price
830660	840740	of this is, all right, thank you.
840740	850100	I just felt like anomalous clitoris is a good, a good 2018 rap name.
850100	858320	I still can't find Balderdash cards, uh, I was looking for weeks.
858320	870060	You know, uh, if you did want rap to be good, there's a person in the empty warehouse that's
870060	876400	just visiting who you played their rap a couple of episodes ago.
876400	878980	Are you talking about Rob Tangem?
878980	885420	He did the, uh, the fuck your mama rap that was like, that we kind of applauded.
885420	886420	It's a big hit.
886420	891140	And he came out and he visited and I don't want to spoil too much, but we laid down some
891140	892140	tracks with him.
892140	893140	We don't know what we're doing.
893140	894140	Can we say what those tracks are?
894140	895140	Should we keep those a secret?
895140	896140	Yeah.
896140	900740	And I mean, keep them a secret makes it seem like it's so important.
900740	910620	I just would say, well, I don't think it blows it to say he's, he felt the need or the, uh,
910620	915460	the compulsion to write a Pringles dick rap.
915460	916460	Is it?
916460	917460	Yeah.
917460	919140	Well, he's, I mean, he's kind of a, he's a really good rap writer.
919140	922140	And he wrote a giraffe rapper that knocks my socks off.
922140	928180	Uh, he, cause, and it was on assignment, which, you know, I don't respond well to people going
928180	930180	like, well, why don't you make it about this?
930180	931180	And they're like, oh, okay.
931180	937660	But we were, he was in town and I was doing a different thing through starbirds.
937660	940940	We're going to be putting out like a little tape that's, that's a tease.
940940	942780	I'll tease it that much.
942780	951700	But like the, and so I had said to Mr. Tanchum, who's visiting, you know, if you did have
951700	960860	any kind of lyrical thoughts about giraffes, love them, hate them, maybe you are a giraffe
960860	966820	and you're like, we could maybe slide you into this, this other stupid thing that I'm
966820	967820	doing.
967820	969740	What I'm doing is not that brilliant.
969740	972780	It's just a, it's just for fans of the podcast.
972780	973780	It might be a little treat.
973780	974780	Sure.
974780	975780	Bring them up.
975780	977260	Let's bring Rob Tanchum up.
977260	989740	Uh, Rob Tanchum to the stage, please.
989740	990740	Everybody meet.
990740	991740	Rob.
991740	992740	Hello.
992740	993740	Rob.
993740	994740	All right.
994740	999700	So like a, a consummate rapper, Dan, you've, you've developed a crew that you've, you've
999700	1001780	you now roll with and he's in it, right?
1001780	1002780	Is that correct?
1002780	1004100	I guess he's part of your crew.
1004100	1005100	You're rolling deep.
1005100	1006860	Would you say you have a posse now or no?
1006860	1007860	I don't know.
1007860	1011100	It's hard to say cause I don't know that what I do is really, you know, I'm a, I'm kind
1011100	1012740	of a performance artist still.
1012740	1015380	I think like I haven't taken pen to paper ever.
1015380	1021260	I mean, Rob went back to where he's staying.
1021260	1023620	I wanted to say hotel, but that's factually inaccurate.
1023620	1029580	You're staying with a friend, but, but if I, but like, like that's the timeframe.
1029580	1036540	Like he, on day one of his visit, I was like, why don't you, if you want to write like
1036540	1044720	a giraffe verse, maybe we can record that tomorrow because we'll both be in the studio.
1044720	1049500	And then he went home and then he came back and he, he had all kinds of shit, including
1049500	1056340	this and, uh, we did record it, but I thought it would be, since we have the beat, do we
1056340	1058620	have the beat?
1058620	1065840	If you're prepared to, are you prepared to wrap it since why not offset my particularly
1065840	1071060	bad evening for me freestyle wise with look, if you, if good rap is what you want or I
1071060	1074420	think you're being too hard on yourself, Dan, I think because we don't have the live audience
1074420	1080540	here, you're not, you don't get that feedback from, I think the people right now are shouting
1080540	1081540	at their laptops.
1081540	1082540	That's not true.
1082540	1086380	Some of his best rapping has been, uh, with recently, yeah.
1086380	1087380	But this wasn't it.
1087380	1090580	No, it's just, this wasn't bad, but certainly not the Heights.
1090580	1091580	It's just fire.
1091580	1092580	It's video games.
1092580	1096340	I think fry the part of your brain that you used to wrap kids.
1096340	1097580	That's I'm not a doctor.
1097580	1098860	I don't play video games.
1098860	1099860	Don't play video games.
1099860	1100860	That's your secret.
1100860	1101860	That's your secret.
1101860	1102860	But you also don't really freestyle.
1102860	1109060	I mean, we don't, I mean, it's not your, no, I practiced earlier in case in, you know,
1109060	1110060	there was a need to freestyle.
1110060	1114860	I wanted to like exercise that muscle beforehand because we never got to, let's do that then.
1114860	1115860	Well, let's do it.
1115860	1120420	We talked about training fours because we were in, we were in the booth at the same
1120420	1121420	time.
1121420	1122940	We did an improv, but we never freestyle together.
1122940	1123940	Right.
1123940	1124940	So I was just ready for it.
1124940	1128540	I don't, I don't want to, you know, I think that I can just like, I'd like the kids to
1128540	1129700	hear your giraffe rap.
1129700	1133820	I think it's, I'm just, yeah, do the same type of exact.
1133820	1134820	You got that beat?
1134820	1137020	No, I'm not going to because I don't want to, I don't want to step on it.
1137020	1140100	I just want people to listen and you don't, don't worry about performance.
1140100	1144820	Like just, just eat the mic and make sure they hear your, your delicious lyrics that
1144820	1149980	you wrote overnight, having been assigned the task of writing about giraffes.
1149980	1155860	Because Dan has a long, weird relationship with, I would say love, hate, but just hate,
1155860	1156860	hate on giraffes.
1156860	1159140	I hate, hate, hate giraffes.
1159140	1161020	Can I adopted that for this one?
1161020	1167260	Cause well, cause the, the, there's a, an existent track of you doing a giraffe rap
1167260	1168260	giraffe rap.
1168260	1173060	Well, I don't want to, I don't want to ruin your giraffe rap eating a leaf, reaching real
1173060	1174380	high to get up to my tree.
1174380	1175380	Yeah.
1175380	1176380	Listen to it in the archive.
1176380	1177380	Yeah.
1177380	1179740	And it's pretty, it's actually one of the more awkward freestyles I've ever done.
1179740	1182780	Cause I rhymed Darwin with hard win.
1182780	1183780	That's great.
1183780	1184780	Which is very funny.
1184780	1185780	And you could have said Herman.
1185780	1186780	I could have said Harmon.
1186780	1187780	Yeah.
1187780	1192300	You could have said, did you just shit your pants?
1192300	1196180	No, I just, I committed to not finishing the sentence.
1196180	1197180	All right.
1197180	1203060	Well, let's, let's, let's just at you when you, when you feel ready, how about this?
1203060	1204580	Can I make a picture?
1204580	1208460	Because you're going to do your rap when it's done.
1208460	1212860	Like when you, when you, when you wrap us through, Dan, why don't you go into some extemporaneous
1212860	1213860	freestyle?
1213860	1216640	Well, I'll tell you the answer is because obviously as we've established, I'm not really
1216640	1218100	on my game tonight.
1218100	1223780	So look, it's not, I'm not saying that if you do a bad job, the show's giving you an
1223780	1225700	opportunity.
1225700	1228740	Let's just, let's just do the thing we said we were going to do.
1228740	1229740	Let's simplify it.
1229740	1232100	Instead data, you can rap about clitorises.
1232100	1233100	Okay.
1233100	1234100	Yes.
1234100	1235100	And a Russian accent.
1235100	1236100	Okay.
1236100	1237100	It's going to be great.
1237100	1238540	As long as we just keep pimping me, it'll be, it'll become a great show.
1238540	1239860	I will become talented.
1239860	1242380	I will, I will become enthusiastic.
1242380	1248260	My brain chemistry will completely change if we just keep making me do stuff.
1248260	1250260	I agree.
1250260	1260660	Let's, when you're, when you're ready, you cue him and then let's listen to this.
1260660	1267660	And then in the track there, there's a lot of Rob Tancham, which is very exciting to
1267660	1268660	me.
1268660	1269660	Okay.
1269660	1270660	Yeah.
1270660	1271660	Giraffe rap.
1271660	1272660	Rapping giraffe facts.
1272660	1273660	Interested in info on giraffes?
1273660	1274660	Well, I have that.
1274660	1275660	Fuck what you heard.
1275660	1276660	Drafts are the worst.
1276660	1277660	Hopefully one day they will be purged from the earth.
1277660	1278660	No one's ever seen a draft go swimming.
1278660	1279660	That's a legitimate draft fact.
1279660	1280660	No kidding.
1280660	1281660	If you drew a bath, the giraffe won't get in it.
1281660	1282660	Bunch of tall assholes don't know what they're missing.
1282660	1283660	Spend a whole goddamn day eating leaves.
1283660	1284660	80 pounds worth of money.
1285660	1286660	No time for hobbies.
1286660	1287660	No skis or trapeze.
1287660	1288660	No leisurely evenings.
1288660	1289660	No reason to please.
1289660	1290660	Barely even sleep.
1290660	1291660	10 minute intervals.
1291660	1292660	Standing straight up.
1292660	1293660	Straight up imbeciles.
1293660	1294660	Only vertebrate species that can't yawn.
1294660	1295660	When they're all gone, I'ma feel invincible.
1295660	1296660	Drink water once every few days.
1296660	1297660	Learning draft facts fills my veins with rage.
1297660	1298660	They're not like me.
1298660	1299660	I don't like them.
1299660	1300660	I don't like them.
1300660	1301660	I don't like them.
1301660	1302660	I don't like them.
1302660	1303660	I don't like them.
1303660	1304660	I don't like them.
1304660	1305660	I don't like them.
1305660	1306660	I don't like them.
1306660	1307660	I don't like them.
1307660	1308660	I don't like them.
1308660	1309660	I don't like them.
1309660	1310660	I don't like them.
1310660	1311660	I don't like them.
1311660	1312660	I don't like them.
1312660	1313660	I don't like them.
1313660	1314660	I don't like them.
1314660	1315660	I don't like them.
1315660	1316660	I don't like them.
1316660	1317660	Drafts aren't human.
1317660	1318660	Drafts can't write rafts.
1318660	1319660	Drafts make no sound.
1319660	1322580	Not because they can, but because they choose not to.
1322580	1323580	What?
1323580	1324580	That's a fact I found.
1324580	1325580	Fucking smug or divorced.
1325580	1327780	If I could, I would fight you.
1327780	1328780	Fuck your rafts.
1328780	1329780	Alright au.
1329780	1330780	Thank you.
1330780	1331780	Big clitorises.
1331780	1332780	Woo.
1332780	1333780	Anomalous clitoris.
1333780	1337780	Take it over.
1337780	1343300	If you see a horse with a very long neck, anomalous clitoris is now on deck.
1343300	1345460	I'm a zookeeper of science.
1345460	1352460	I drop it mad and I don't know why it's so hard to have a foot this big.
1352460	1353620	Check out my rig.
1353620	1356300	It's an 18 wheel truck.
1356300	1358460	Anomalous clitoris is hard to fuck.
1358460	1364780	You don't know where to put your wiener when the clitoris is far less leaner.
1364780	1373180	It's just not the right time in our nation's history.
1373180	1375540	It's not the right time.
1375540	1378180	You really ran with it more than I expected.
1378180	1381740	You're a real sport and that should be commended.
1381740	1382740	But yeah.
1382740	1383740	How about those lyrics?
1383740	1387300	Are you saying that it's a real giraffe fact that giraffes can make sounds but they choose
1387300	1388300	not to?
1388300	1390260	This was the phrasing of it.
1390260	1392700	Giraffes don't make sounds.
1392700	1396220	I did a Google perusing.
1396220	1400540	But giraffes don't make sounds not because they can't but because they choose not to
1400540	1403100	which is infuriating.
1403100	1405340	They have the capacity to make verbal chords.
1405340	1406340	They could make a sound?
1406340	1410660	I guess according to Discovery Kids or Discovery Adults or whatever fact.
1410660	1414780	I go to Discovery Kids for all of my facts.
1414780	1419860	So they have the capacity to make a noise.
1420060	1421060	But they're like why?
1421060	1422060	I'm a fucking giraffe.
1422060	1423060	Yeah.
1423060	1424380	What am I going to do?
1424380	1427220	Say hey there's some leaves over here?
1427220	1432860	They have no reason to make any noise because they have to because they require I rounded
1432860	1439420	up to 80 for the lyric but it was 75 or over pounds of food a day and because they're eating
1439420	1443380	traps they have to they're eating leaves and their drafts they have to spend all day eating
1443380	1447580	so there's nothing else they don't they don't have a reason I've wasted those calories on
1447580	1448580	talking shit.
1449300	1453700	I've never asked myself this question like giraffes I'm assuming they're like in the
1453700	1465180	same biomes that you know they're I'm assuming their predators are like big cats like your
1465180	1471580	pumas and your jaguars actually people only fuck with the young giraffes because the big
1471580	1477660	giraffes will just kung fu kick the fuck out of you but are you do you do you know
1477660	1484700	that there's videos where they can kick a giraffe so if a tiger sees a giraffe or a lion
1484700	1488300	they'll go like oh well they'll fuck with a full grown giraffe even a pack of them the
1488300	1493220	giraffe will A outrun them and if you outrun them no they're fast they're fast as shit
1493220	1498060	and if they kick if they kick you you're you're done they're like they'll break your jaw you
1498060	1503140	can't eat anymore you're a dead tiger or dead lion rather they if they fucking give
1503140	1508220	you one karate chop with one of their hoofs you you've dislocated something and you can't
1508220	1513500	operate anymore so the big cats know not to fuck with the full grown we know why they
1513500	1518260	don't choose to make sounds I mean they're like the the the Winston Churchill's of their
1518260	1527100	bodies made of big sticks right well if the body was made of big sticks they would speak
1527100	1531580	even more than softly or would they be allowed to speak more softly because they're just
1531580	1536660	one they're always carrying four giants oh have you seen them fight the rest of the Churchill
1536660	1542440	quote it says speak softly carry a big stick and it's dot dot dot and if your body's made
1542440	1546660	of giant sticks don't speak at all have you seen them fucking fight each other they just
1546660	1551860	go they wank it's called necking it's crazy they club each other and church I think you
1551860	1554420	pointed out to me that they did you point out to me that they have the same amount of
1554420	1559820	vertebrae they have the same they have seven vertebrae they're just in their neck they're
1559820	1567820	just long long ass vertebrae they're like extravert extra vertebrae if Schwab was here
1567820	1574820	he'd launch a whole comic book extra vertebrae is a giraffe with eight vertebrae in his neck
1574820	1580460	and like dies not to remove the joy from my hatred of giraffes which is just you know
1580460	1586580	like it's because it's obviously it's like that's the thing that we learn about in evolution
1586580	1590780	is like oh that's that's an illustration of Darwinian evolution is that you slowly get
1590780	1597940	a longer neck and it's like not how humans roll like we didn't we didn't our bodies didn't
1597940	1604980	morph to suit our surroundings we we became we became hackers of the environment didn't
1604980	1609780	trees I mean maybe trees got taller because of other animals like like like the trees
1609780	1613740	and the giraffes were meeting each other that's just one reason why did you don't want
1613740	1620060	to go the long neck route I said like like don't don't play footsie with Mother Earth
1620060	1625020	like fucking get down to roll up your sleeves she's been trying to kill you for fucking
1625020	1633640	eight billion years man fucking take a piece I'm not a conservative I'm not saying drill
1633640	1637700	baby drill who do you think is the most efficient animal in the animal kingdom you're obviously
1637700	1643460	not giraffes but who's the most efficient animal yeah who's the most Darwinian are efficient
1643460	1647500	design well I'm supposed to say cockroach because they survive the nuclear whatever
1647500	1651980	but but I mean I forgetting about that nuclear holocaust thing which I don't know how much
1651980	1658900	of that is apocryphal or whatever you call it I feel like ants are yeah because they
1658900	1669560	they're they're basically dirt that moves they they've combined individual life form
1669560	1681880	and colony and and and yes through the the colonial technique like they it doesn't matter
1681880	1690700	if one of them dies and yet they just like I don't know it's it's kind of amazing what
1690700	1695020	they do those little guys that's an interesting answer in comparison to drafts because one
1695020	1701380	of the draft facts that I learned is that they have no societal hierarchy or structure
1701380	1706180	or anything they're the opposite of ants they're just they're they're they're freeform oh man
1706180	1710340	see I said what I knew this was gonna happen if we start if I actually ever researched
1710400	1714960	drafts I knew I would fall in love with them I have I have one big one that they sound like
1714960	1725960	the dolphin of the desert I think that I think that's what I can't episode title it didn't make
1725960	1734040	it into the wrap but there's a very interesting one was that before mating a female draft will
1734040	1739560	urinate into the male drafts mouth how does he get down there I don't know I don't know it's got a
1739560	1743700	long neck well cuz I can lean and they're all these things where they can't reach the ground
1743700	1747540	they can't really sit but that's that's part of it and I don't want I didn't want to bring it in
1747540	1752580	and wait a negative context the female giraffe peas in the male giraffe mouth yeah and that's
1752580	1760820	courtship oh yeah yeah I think yeah I think it's to taste fertility taste fertility giraffes taste
1761080	1772240	she's saying welcome to flavor country I'm ready let me pee in your mouth and taste whether or not
1772240	1777320	you want to fuck me I mean that definitely is like the opposite of ants right because it's
1777320	1782320	like there's no there's no power dynamic there I mean you we think well whoever's getting their
1782320	1789160	mouth peed in is on bottom but I mean first of all these are giraffes they no one's on bottom
1789820	1796980	their heads like in the clouds but they but but it's also like like wait so she it's it's down
1796980	1802140	and drinks for pee I didn't see a diagram I didn't see any type does she pee in a puddle and he laps
1802140	1809980	up the puddle yeah she's in a puddle and he laps it up for real no that's stupid I I I'm assuming
1809980	1815860	that she said she jet that it jets like it goes up he doesn't even bend down that it's like
1816040	1821080	like a ping pong goes that far up she can shoot pee in the air well what I love about that is it's
1821080	1828560	all voluntary everything has agency every of the guy the girl like yet that I don't mind me but if
1828560	1837520	anyone's interested like like check out what's for sale look I choose not to talk I'm not a man
1837520	1843880	with words I you know like let's just simplify things pee in my mouth let me taste whether or
1843880	1849260	not and then wander by and like take a slurp like it's from in Milwaukee what we call a bubbler
1849260	1854780	and and you sip it and then you go like good morning Margaret and then you just keep walking
1854780	1860140	like she's not offended you know like if you're not into it if you're like you know what I I'm
1860140	1867220	gonna if I was a female giraffe and peed in some but some gentleman's mouth and he just walked by
1867220	1873280	I'd be very offended I would say well what's my pee is not good enough for you well how do you go
1873280	1877040	back and I would get nervous I would leave the room and like I would pee in the man because I
1877040	1883000	walked in on you peeing you did you did and I did get I I admitted to you being a pea shy and I
1883000	1888120	stopped peeing I was he was already peeing in the urinal at Starburns I went into the stock the
1888120	1895000	as the stall yeah peed came out and you were kind of like and you but you walked in you said excited
1895000	1900100	to hear that giraffe rap yeah I said I said hello how do you do I thought you were either mid or post
1900100	1908020	pee free and then I was washing my hands and you were bravely admitted I did that thing where I
1908020	1914020	didn't pee because you scared me when you walked in here's what I like about the pee tasting design
1914020	1922980	sexually the as a courtship ritual there is no I'm saying like it's happening behind her she's
1922980	1930560	peeing it's she's she's facing this way so is it you need just pee and then whoever's behind you
1930560	1936300	just takes it takes a taste like they're at a wine party you think the guy's sneak attack pee tasting
1936300	1940860	or is she peeing she said hey come over here I want to pee in your mouth well I don't I say this
1940860	1947700	is I don't talk to each other I'm picturing a jet of pee so I don't think I'd be surprised he said the
1947700	1952500	female peas in the male's mouth we all thought the same thing how is that even physically possible
1952500	1958080	they're giraffes so then I went to well maybe it's like a jet coming out of her nethers like
1958080	1962580	going arcing into the air and then it made me think of like a garden hose like at a fun party
1962580	1968580	where like like it doesn't matter there's enough for everyone and and like and that and that and
1968580	1974460	that that way like there could be like several males like walking by and they just like take
1974460	1980300	a nibble you know of it like maybe that's just say let's say I'm designing a perfect species here
1980300	1987500	I'm not I don't know what giraffes do we're almost there like like like the woman pees in a in a giant
1987500	1994460	arc and if you don't want to get peed on you don't go near there yeah but also I don't think in this
1994460	2002460	species culture there's a lot of pee phobia but but but you if you're in the vicinity of a woman
2002460	2009100	who's peeing you you walk through it like a sprinkler you can pretend you didn't taste anything
2010060	2014060	that's not offensive to her you just walk through it and go top of the morning Sheila
2014860	2021100	and but if it's you know if you if you if you get something on your tongue that's like jeez she is
2021660	2030540	like like dropping a thousand eggs today I don't know how you measure fertility I just like she is
2030620	2038860	fecund and then and you're like you know and I'm kind of I'm a little riled up myself
2038860	2046380	truth be told uh and then you circle around and you say Sheila you're you're positively glowing
2046380	2053900	today your urine is on my face it tastes like you're you'd make a baby giraffe without me
2054860	2061660	um want to make one with me I'm assuming then she goes she can say yes or no and it's just
2061660	2066380	like it's checks and balances you know we wouldn't have any of these problems and then if if if if
2066380	2073900	he this is perfecting the species if she rebukes him she's like I'd rather be with Stanley than you
2073900	2081500	Donald the guy he could go all right and he can block her exit and jerk off into a potted plant
2081500	2087500	that's the perfect species just to just to psychologically torture her and then we're done
2087500	2093500	perfect I'm kidding Jesus Christ everybody's laughing at every other dumb fucking thing
2093500	2101900	I'm sorry I looked it up it's definitely an act it's not like a uh but there's a picture
2102460	2104700	church has footage of giraffes being on people
2109420	2116780	like a bubbler that almost looks like a giraffe drinking its own pee bendy are those necks
2119980	2123580	it's like they're drinking it's gotta be so tired you know what it's like it's like in the
2123580	2128300	Lion King where everyone's around the watering hole and all the different you know and then
2128300	2134140	there's the drafts and they bend down and drink out of the communal just they bend down I haven't
2134140	2140620	seen it uh Lion King that's the main part of it Lion King it's mostly about giraffes so a giraffe
2140620	2148940	sees a male giraffe sees a female giraffe taking a pee no it's it's a it's a it's a it's a ritual
2148940	2153500	it's a ritual it's like rubbing a neck okay so when they're courting she's like all right
2153500	2158460	hey do yourself a favor get around down here get around the back end of this attack
2160620	2166460	fucking pee on you every other species is like it's it's like somebody's just you know like
2167180	2176060	like somebody's just you know being coerced yeah I like sprinkler pee so are you on team giraffe
2176060	2181580	now or I like the way they do some stuff I like that they stomp tigers I like that they're an herbivore
2181580	2188140	that tigers are afraid of I don't know you know maybe lions or maybe that long neck ain't so dumb
2189500	2194620	yeah I mean they they whack each other like they really hurt each other by just swinging their
2194620	2201020	giant ass head they're like uh I forgot how much they weighed I mean the I really did learn some
2201020	2205980	giraffe backs they're there those are fatal uh fatal blows yeah they're like I don't know I'm
2205980	2211020	gonna say like they're 70 pound necks they're they're crazy but that's not the right number
2211020	2216220	they must get like neck problems all the time you'd think right like if they're whacking people
2216220	2220940	with their necks like that would knock your vertebrae out of alignment you'd think but also
2220940	2226140	they have good posture they're not like staring down at screens they're up right they were for a
2226140	2235020	while right they're not like in drama club you know they have reasons to uh I'm not gonna jump
2235020	2241820	the shark of starting to like giraffes but so I so you've softened your stance on giraffes maybe
2241820	2250700	a little bit well I just saying you respect your enemy like whoa and and I just the the important
2250700	2255500	thing is that you know the reason I come down on giraffes is because people I think there's an
2255500	2261340	unspoken assumption that human beings because they don't have long necks and they don't eat really
2261340	2265500	high leaves and they don't live in the desert they don't walk around and they don't have animal
2265500	2271260	print like style like that because that because of that like we're some kind of horrible species
2271260	2277580	that like deserves to die and whoa we're killing the planet come on we're we're pretty amazing
2278300	2284460	we're like little little monkey robots like we're we're great we we we took a different route
2285180	2295820	we're like hey listen like what am I gonna be the perfect squirrel no I was he become a an ape
2295820	2301260	and then and then like you know we we represent the branch of DNA that's like just kept just kept
2301260	2306060	kept doubling down on fucking insanity you know just going like why don't you just fucking be
2306060	2312460	Howard Hughes about it just show me the blueprints baby and and and that's uh that's a proud proud
2312460	2322300	legacy which stands on like um like uh spiders like a bird birds yeah I don't I don't I don't
2322300	2331100	admire them oh you don't no they have the gift of flight then a gift or the free cookie of flight
2331100	2336380	that was laying on the table that no one wanted to eat evolution they they they they they built
2336380	2341100	feathers over over time they turned from lizards into into feathered creatures that could fly
2341100	2346300	yeah but look how many birds there are like I like like it's so derivative like how many species
2346300	2354140	like there's like five billion species of bird right they're all like like like like like you
2354140	2359180	know we've tuned it out because we evolved after them so our eardrums don't bleed from listening
2359180	2363580	to it but they're fucking garbage uh animals like they're they're just constantly going like
2363580	2370700	hey look out look out my name is Steve wow wow hey over here check it out whoa whoa like like
2370700	2378300	like they're they're insane we've become them now a bit but but like it it's like I mean birds are
2378300	2383580	just garbage what about like a like a noble like owl like just lives alone hunts at night and just
2383580	2389340	does his thing and his head can swivel crazy I mean predatory birds are pretty kind of interesting
2389340	2395820	because they're birds but they eat fucking mammals that's fucking cool that's berserk
2395820	2403580	any any any animal any species that crosses back over like like fish that eat fucking uh
2404140	2412300	people or birds or spiders that eat like fish like like like I you gotta automatically go
2413180	2418540	they're awesome just because they're just they're like neo in the matrix like they're
2418620	2425740	they're not even like that's pretty crazy if you're a fish and you eat a monkey like even though
2425740	2432140	the monkey is my relative I gotta I'm not I'm not like oh that monkey deserved it I'm not a victim
2432140	2440460	blamer I'm just saying like that's a cool fish how do you feel about uh whales I don't I don't
2440700	2448940	I get it don't don't you know I look uh you know they had legs and they bailed
2451500	2456060	the whales had legs yeah whales were like I don't know hippos or something and then they
2456060	2460620	went back into the ocean like they're like just can't do it do they have vestigial hind legs and
2460620	2464780	stuff I think they have yeah you can see from the they have hip bones all right yeah I mean
2464780	2474460	they're mammals that live in the ocean yeah let's not Jeff please Jeff mammals uh dolphins uh uh
2475420	2480780	sea lions walruses you know these are these are these are these are mammals that spent some
2480780	2487340	enough time on land that they had they have shoulders and hips and then they then they went
2487340	2492540	back into the ocean why do you think they went back I mean there's too many birds I don't want
2492540	2501180	to punch down but it's like I mean you think they gave up no they they went for they went for
2501180	2507260	the brass ring of course they gave up they went back to the where amoebas are they yeah they gave
2507260	2511260	up they went up they go this it's fucking crazy out here there's a sun that fucking beats your
2511260	2515660	ass all day long and it's fucking they might have just chose there's tigers there's giraffes
2515660	2520860	peeing on each other like I'd rather go back and swim yeah I just you know people go like
2520860	2526460	oh the dolphins are so how do we know they're not like the best species ever because just because
2526460	2530540	we can't understand them because they squeak when they talk well I'll tell you how we know because
2530540	2536860	they were they were like dogs that bailed that's how we know they were on land they had a shot
2537660	2543180	they had a shot dolphins are smarter than dogs yeah I'm sure dolphins are smarter than a lot
2543180	2547580	of things but you know what they're not smarter than us because they fucking like we stuck it
2547580	2552940	out man we're like all right here we go I think a great time to climb a tree motherfucker what
2552940	2560860	about what about like a freaking badass crocodile like they have no enemies there's no one above
2560860	2564780	them in the food chain crocodiles and alligators you gotta you gotta give them props right because
2564780	2569260	they're like basically dinosaurs they they're like they stuck it out they're like they're like your
2569260	2575180	friend that listens to vinyl but like they but actually has like a system that you're like oh
2575180	2579580	actually I gotta hand it to you you're not just jerking yourself off here like you this works
2580460	2588060	like I can't get uh purple people eater uh on uh itunes yeah man you get it you know like like
2588060	2592860	like when you have a friend that's like a vinyl hipster that's like you actually can see the
2592860	2600300	practicality in it but if you put a giraffe versus uh a crocodile yeah giraffe's gonna win
2601260	2606380	can cannot run them or but I'm not you know I'm not a violent I don't believe that what what's
2606380	2611020	then sharks we should all love sharks right sharks are fucking dicks like the sharks are the worst
2611020	2616540	you don't like sharks no sharks are assholes sharks are sharks are amoeba that just fucking
2616540	2623420	like fucking voted for trump at every like uh evolutionary election like they just they just
2623420	2627500	turned into they just everybody was like like like the other amoeba were like we're gonna become
2628140	2633260	worms and tubes and the and the the sharks are the ones that were like yeah but wouldn't we need
2633260	2637580	teeth to like eat and everyone's like okay cool you can do that but there's lots of plants to eat
2637580	2643100	and they're just like and then just like they just turned into giant mouths that just float
2643100	2648060	through the ocean what's the difference between you glorifying humans for sticking it out on land
2648940	2652700	versus sharks sticking it out in the water and perfecting being in the water well I'm gonna say
2652700	2658220	across the board if you're in the ocean you're a pussy like I I I'm just saying like that is a
2658220	2663100	fucking hard stance I know well also I didn't want to this thing is like language fails me because
2663100	2667180	it's like this pussy thing like I'm trying I've been trying to like remove that from my vocabulary
2667180	2672620	because it's like it's you know like I used to I used to say fag and retard and stuff too and like
2672620	2678540	I had to like teach myself to like knock it off and like pussies like but it's hard like I need
2678620	2682620	like a you know I want to talk about if you can go back in time and still use the words
2682620	2689740	fag pussy and retard what are giraffes you're not gonna that's not I I think we're going back
2689740	2697980	at time let's put let's put the n-word back on the table too yeah guys we are living in a time
2697980	2705420	when I can use all those words it's a choice uh that's that's that's the it's that I the secret
2705420	2711740	service didn't come to my house I I my doctor didn't tell me cut down on the n-word um I'm going
2711740	2717340	to say the word giraffe but but but no and then I'm going to say fag pussy and retard you know we
2717340	2724460	were what you did not my doctor did tell me it's a new it's a new board game that's right
2724460	2730540	new sweep edition uh biology classes everywhere playing fag pussy retard if you if you pay five
2730620	2735500	dollars a month for subscription to harmontown you can find out whether Dan thinks giraffes
2735500	2740860	or facts wait but then we should make it a full fuck mary kill and have three animals and do and
2740860	2748620	play fag pussy retard I'm not I'm not subscribing I didn't say any of those words um but all I'm
2748620	2754220	saying is like if you're in the ocean you you called all sea animals pussies I know I'm I've
2754220	2759260	been biting my lip trying to think of like a way to say like I'm saying like like you you you're
2759260	2767740	you're in the in the you're if you're in the ocean the the earth is 85 percent water okay so
2767740	2773900	as we all know every human being is 85 percent moron like like like every everything everything
2773900	2783180	is 85 garbage hack dumb 85 of all dentists suck at dentistry you know 85 of all comics are unfunny
2783580	2790140	you know 85 percent of this podcast is is this retarded um they're like and 85 percent of the
2790140	2794220	planet is water 85 percent of our body is water and it's like it's like yeah it's the default
2794220	2799020	it's where we started okay I'm a little I'm a little teapot here I'm called I'm an amoeba
2799020	2804620	I'm like okay I got a organ now I got some ribosomes I'm gonna and then it's like yeah I
2804620	2811260	you have you have I forgive you because I am you I'm your great grandson amoeba like but
2811980	2821420	but the the amoeba that exists today right now the modern amoeba he was just born a couple days ago
2822300	2828940	he's an idiot like he's a jerk his parents like we we we are a part of the family that branched
2828940	2837980	off like our dna was assembled by like you know risk takers like we're we're we're a we're a branch
2837980	2847580	of the of the phenomenon called living genetics we are the tentacle coming off of that one thing
2849020	2855260	that is the tentacle that actually grabs the brass ring all the other tentacles are like you know
2855260	2861340	just for safety's sake why not stay in elbino cave fish well I'll tell you why you can't you can't
2861340	2868780	see anything it's ridiculous like what about birds birds came everything came from the sea
2868780	2876300	and from we haven't gone to the air and they were descended from like land reptiles they go fuck it
2877020	2883580	I'm gonna master the sky they were flying for millions of years just you know insects did that
2883580	2889420	it's dumb spores do that oh I'm gonna spores are great I'm gonna fly through the air and land on
2890140	2896380	that's awesome I just think it's cooler to be a lizard and then go up on two legs and like I mean
2897100	2902140	it's just kind of neat kind of cool kind of cool what we did we come out of the water
2904140	2908060	that we had to have like a scuba tank lung full of water for a while
2908060	2915820	so I learned to like got better lungs we could breathe air it's like got was crawling got fur
2915820	2921820	now this is where some of our cousins got weird fur that turned into feathers and started flapping
2921820	2925580	around I don't know what to think about them you're talking to about them like they're gods
2925580	2930220	or angels I just don't I just think that they're like your weird cousin you know the liberal arts
2930220	2935660	major or something I just I don't know whether to admire them or not I just don't I know well I'm
2935660	2941820	saying like I don't I don't I'm not like looking up at birds and going like fuck they really nailed
2941820	2948700	it because I just they have hollow bones you know that's why is that bad they have brains the size
2948700	2951980	of a of the head of a pin like they don't even I don't even think they know what they're doing
2951980	2958060	honestly half the time I think you nailed it with uh what I immediately imagined as like a
2958060	2964780	inspirational motivational poster and an office setting with the dolphins are dogs who gave up
2964780	2970460	and just like a beautiful picture of dolphins yeah don't be a dolphin be the dog stick it out
2970460	2977180	yeah so but here's the thing is big fans of my podcast already know if you've listened to 400
2977180	2983020	episodes of the show you know I subscribe to the Elaine Morgan theory of of uh human evolution
2983020	2988780	which is explains the fact that we're different from shimps gorillas and orangutans uh in all the
2988780	2995740	ways that dolphins um sea lions walruses are different from other uh mammals we have everything
2995740	3001580	in common with dolphins and whatnot that we don't have in common with our great great ape cousins
3002540	3010780	and Elaine Morgan suggests that that's because four million years ago we too flirted with
3010780	3018540	the dolphin root just long enough to lose our hair uh get blubbery fat and
3018540	3023340	regulatable breathing upright vertical posture and then for some reason
3024220	3029340	fucking we tufted up what if we got back on that land and that's why our story structure follows
3029340	3036700	that what if dolphins kicked us out of the sea oh my god we were exiled to land or we or we got
3036700	3040780	jealous of them like we saw we just they were like hey you want to play and we were like oh
3041820	3046940	yeah I think I forgot my phone and we were just like petty about it because they're like
3047500	3055020	I think that's the thing about the aquatic ape theory is that that your early hominoids fled to
3055020	3061980	the water's edge because it was full of giant animal I'm not gonna lie if I'm playing the
3061980	3069340	first person shooter of of ancient earth yeah that thought's gonna cross my head look why don't we
3069340	3074220	stand like we're deep in the ocean see if this tiger wants to if if a big ass saber tooth tigers
3074220	3079820	come in as you I go I can I can go paddle out yeah and then oh like oh there's food down here
3079820	3085020	I can I can hold my breath for five seconds and go get an abalone and oh this is giving me all
3085020	3091020	these B vitamins and my brain expands yeah and I come back out of the ocean and go oh I like I'm
3091020	3097100	smarter now I can probably make a weapon and kill these tigers but there was also the thing why not
3097100	3101980	just live in the water like no because there's things worse than tigers in the ocean there's
3102060	3106620	sharks yeah I mean it could have just been ambition it could have been like okay let's
3106620	3112940	stay in the water but like you know see you later and then like like and the people that
3112940	3118380	did stay in the water were out hunted and there are there are people in Africa that live like
3118380	3125820	very much like you know the the women give birth in the in the in the surf they squat and the baby
3125820	3132380	comes out like a little wine quirk and uh or a poop a little poop um and they kind of they kind
3132380	3139180	of bob to the surface the iron aisles um I don't know if it's the iron aisles or not um I haven't
3139180	3145820	I haven't I haven't I haven't it's been a long time since I looked at the maps um but uh the the
3147580	3151820	but it could also be I mean and this is cartoonish of me to suggest because I really don't know
3151820	3157660	anything obviously I'm talking about but could it could it also have been an ice age like is that
3157660	3164300	cartoonish thing well maybe we had a semi-aquatic phase during a time when the the primates in
3164300	3170540	general are the are the reason that they're all going extinct is because they're we we are the
3170540	3182060	result of a particularly like lush equatorial like super rich um kind of like uh a tropical
3183260	3189660	biome you know that like could afford to sustain a great ape which is an ape that can't even fucking
3189660	3195180	climb trees anymore basically like like doesn't have a tail anymore and and is a big giant just
3195180	3203660	almost waste of time except for yours truly hello old so-and-so so that's why I don't like
3203660	3208140	giraffes you know because I just feel like they're glorified like there's nothing in the
3208940	3213260	who's out there that's the thing horrifying giraffes who's who's who's the big deal about
3213260	3219100	giraffes Africa leans on them pretty hard I feel like what do you what does that mean
3219980	3226620	anytime you see like a commercial for Africa I think of elephants personally but I was in a
3226620	3234540	in a hot tub at the uh Disney World's Africa what church what's that resort called with the uh
3234540	3244300	the African resort in Florida animal kingdom so we just like drank every a beer in every country
3244300	3250460	in Epcot it's called drinking the world I made it through then we went back to the crib no that
3250460	3255180	we saw like Cirque du Soleil everyone fell asleep I made it through somehow I went back and took
3255180	3261340	a uh like a like a Vicodin or a Percocet or something like that and sat in a jacuzzi and
3261340	3266140	I was so drunk and I took this painkiller and I felt like I was floating above the jacuzzi
3266140	3271820	and a fucking giraffe walked by like right next to the fence where I was and there was a big ass
3271820	3276940	giraffe walked by starts and he just gave me a look in the look even if I weren't drunk and on
3276940	3284220	a painkiller the look was like he fucking drunk bro he fucking gave me a very like a very
3284220	3290620	professional like fatherly kind of like wow then he peed in my mouth and I started fucking him
3291820	3298700	do you mean fucking him and I mean I was fucking here's the thing about fucking a giraffe you really
3298700	3303260	gotta get up there you need a lighter I think that giraffe because he's his DNA is old and
3303260	3308060	African I think he was looking he was going by looking at a a monkey and some water and and
3308060	3314460	going like when are you guys gonna pick a lane pick a lane I thought I thought the giraffe was
3314460	3319500	seeing you being a in a body of water like swimming or something and feel like I can't
3319500	3324380	as you know that they they choose not to swim right no they choose not to speak they can't swim
3324380	3328860	well they've no one's ever seen that no one's ever seen it hard to believe we've electrocuted
3328860	3333580	an elephant they're very I will don't I will donate my job but this is my thing I'm looking
3333580	3340300	where's my camera $50,000 for footage of a giraffe swimming oh no
3342300	3348140	huh I don't care if you could be breaststroke and I want to see a fucking giraffe breaststroke
3348140	3353820	breaststroke I just just making it from one from point A to point B and just completely swimming
3353820	3359580	along well you know there's that what is that like British show like called the sex box where
3359580	3364060	there's a big box and the people go and have sex in the box on stage completely in private
3364700	3369340	maybe if we set something like that up then a giraffe would maybe feel more comfortable swimming
3369340	3373580	because no one would actually be seeing it yeah I think giraffes probably do swim
3373580	3377420	they're just embarrassed about it clearly also I think probably when no one's no one's listening
3377500	3379180	they're fucking chatting up a storm
3384860	3391020	that would be great what do you think a giraffe sounds like uh like a like a like a high pitched
3391020	3398700	cow well just dude can't you just that's guys that's that's I would pick that as a giraffe
3398700	3402940	sound yes that was a little peacocky
3408940	3411820	that's a good one what do you do what do you give us a drip
3415180	3418620	did that get picked up at all might be one of those I put my hand over the mic
3419500	3424700	it might be guttural and kind of camel like oh because camels yeah I think it camels okay
3424700	3429740	so we're talking about a tenor camel like a camera like a camera is like a camel is like a
3429740	3434380	there's footage of giraffe spitting right giraffe spit at people that's camels well
3434380	3438700	camels do that but that's what I'm saying like maybe their or just their latin name or their
3438700	3444460	roman name is that they looked like it has something to do with camels because they the
3444460	3452140	romans or whoever was spotted them was said this is a like a weird camel that makes sense yeah
3452140	3457260	weird camel weird everything's a weird camel yeah you can't you can't just add weird to
3457980	3463340	that's like are giraffes dramedaries or no I was gonna say I think they are but are they
3463340	3468060	part of the dramedary family or no dramedary that's us I don't know I don't know the word
3468060	3472220	that word didn't you just google's a couple nights ago Tom Rob I called you Tom I don't
3472220	3478700	know why you're Tom all of a sudden the Roman uh taxonomical uh chart is just oh it's just a
3478780	3483340	chicken at the top and then everything that tastes like chicken which is everything just down in
3483340	3491340	different weird camel tastes like chicken I don't know I just thought that was like whatever I didn't
3491340	3498940	connect I didn't connect those dots very well you know the the Romans would bring on the triumphs
3498940	3505580	when they would conquer like cities in Africa or in you know like the the middle east and
3505580	3511020	stuff and they bring back these animals and they walk them they bring an elephant back to Rome
3511020	3515180	everybody lose their fucking mind it's like what like the world's full of aliens and then they
3515180	3523020	just attack it with swords yeah I'm no I don't think it's funny animal cruelty I just think it's
3523020	3529100	funny how dumb we are is like that that that you I don't know it's just like little kids understand
3529100	3533820	that giraffes aren't shouldn't be fought with swords but Romans didn't like know that yeah you
3533820	3538540	know like they just they just took giraffes and put them in the colosseum and then had like a
3538540	3543420	slave attack it with a stick you know her badasses that nobody fucks with is an adult zebra zebras
3543420	3548380	will fucking get you they'll fuck it they're just made of muscle their horses like with muscles
3548380	3554940	horses are scary like I don't know I think we take horses for granted because they're common
3554940	3560860	animals you know but when you see a horse it's like that's a fucking monster like if this thing
3560860	3566060	had scales I would be running but you notice that we've never domesticated zebras because you
3566060	3569980	can't because they won't be fucking domesticated you cannot you've never seen anybody riding a
3569980	3579580	zebra because zebra will eat you no they have a lot of them in Tijuana um uh what it's they even
3579580	3586140	you know Tijuana Tijuana they yeah they have like that's donkeys I know they spray paint them I'm
3586940	3591580	doing a bit what the donkey shows spray paint the donkeys to be like out on the street corner
3591580	3598380	what do they call them zonkeys for some reason and I don't know why for some other reason they
3598380	3606220	love Tweety Bird but but like I they they just at every street corner it's just it's like a thing
3606220	3613180	that they you spray you you paint the donkey with stripes and then you like you charge people to
3613180	3620380	take a picture standing that's fucked up but a zebra will kick your ass a zebra beat up a horse
3621420	3625180	I want to see zebra versus giraffe I wonder how much flexibility is in that marketplace like if
3625180	3634940	I'm a Tijuana businessman and I have a donkey like like are they being like just unimaginative
3634940	3640780	or is this like a steel trap of a market where like if you like one guy tries to put antlers
3640780	3647500	and then it's just like fucking boo no like his family starves it's just like fuck you you idiot
3648300	3653260	like they have reality shows down there like called zonkey rescue where a guy comes in and
3653260	3657340	goes like so what are you doing here well I just thought I'd put antlers on my donkey it's like
3657340	3661020	let me let me ask you something you see where are you standing right now Tijuana
3661020	3666540	like look around what do you see human shit and prostitutes what else zonkeys well so what what
3666540	3674860	so you thought that you just try to just like be dr morrow about the market yeah well like the
3674860	3678380	animal activist I thought I'd try something different well you just tried losing all your
3678380	3682780	money all right next cha-ching like whatever their sting is and then it goes to commercial
3682780	3687260	what if somebody brought an actual zebra down to Tijuana like would that fuck up the marketplace
3687260	3696460	or the holy shit that's like a Nathan for you yeah let's pitch it just bring a real zebra down
3696540	3701580	to Tijuana I think I think that zebra gets killed immediately because like like no this is like
3702380	3709500	like I I didn't spend all this money on donkey spray paint for you to bring in a pre-spray
3709500	3714700	painted donkey by the way the zebra can protect itself Tijuana may be the cleanest city if you're
3714700	3721260	in Tijuana you listen to the podcast I'm very sorry I I'm talking about the what 20 years ago
3721260	3728460	when you took a train down to Tijuana and whatever neighborhood there's no Tia it's Tijuana
3728460	3736300	we love your bibles who invited sir hi zonkey get off your high zonkey
3743100	3749020	I don't know I don't know I don't know if that's like if there's like if Tijuana is like a giant
3749020	3756060	city and there's like a huge like awesome clean part of it or just a struggling but integral part
3756060	3760460	that then people are like so bummed out because Americans always refer to Tijuana as like a shit
3760460	3767020	oil but these are like the times where Elmo's of of Mexico right they're the cosplayers right
3769580	3774460	you know what else is in Tijuana we lost you lost you lost time
3774460	3781980	I mean but but I know I'm not but I it's the job isn't to keep me like I I'm not a
3781980	3786220	fucking I'm I'm no optimist prime like I'm not gonna lead you guys to victory
3786220	3791420	for uh Cybertron like I'm just fucking wandering around up here like an idiot you guys hear about
3791420	3797580	these bees knees yeah they're big all the rage in the 20s they're the cat's pajamas what uh what
3797580	3809580	would be what would be like a 2017 knee you know like the bees knees of 2017 you mean like what
3809580	3815740	what what creature in the animal kingdom's knees are more fashionable today because they're I don't
3815740	3820780	think I think the bees knees are kind of lame these days yeah I mean we do like our bees these
3820780	3827820	days I think but but but but look let's pick another one I'd say the elephant's knees because
3827820	3832700	don't elephants have four knees aren't they the only mammal that has four forward bending knees
3832700	3836700	man that dude I went to this party last night that shit was the elephant's knees
3838940	3849100	that works it might accidentally encourage poachers yeah yeah man that shit that shit was
3849100	3855580	the flamingos knees I'm sorry you guys we don't this is a bad this was bad if it was
3856620	3863820	oh yeah do you I have a good phrase for something that goes badly the flamingos knees
3864540	3866140	what about missus c's knees
3868620	3870300	hardly what anyone's paying attention to
3872220	3878140	if her knees are visible so is the tip of her her bat her giant salami like clitoris
3878940	3881420	it dangles that's a long salami
3883740	3891580	missus c's knees oh I'll take it should we play some prolonged uh dnd what do you think
3891580	3896220	is it still prolonged have we been it's like I really lose track of time up here
3897100	3903020	time has been moving very slowly I want to assure you subscribers that I'm never it's a moving
3903020	3908700	target I you know if we do the show 52 weeks a year as we have been like sometimes it's just
3908700	3913180	going to be and look here's the thing where are you going to take your business kerosene keeler
3913180	3919420	uh oh too late looks like the throne is empty sounds like someone's the king of boring broadcasts
3920540	3923020	maybe I'll do a film noir parody for six hours
3924780	3929900	until you find bop a rhubarb until the news drops that
3929900	3934860	Spencer has been forcing potted plants to watch him jerk off for five years that's still legal
3934860	3940700	right is that out of fashion it's certainly legal I just don't know how that affects our business
3940700	3946860	model our podcast I would like to say is well I don't want to jinx it but we are we are we are
3946860	3953660	we are proofed against uh future allegations because I have spent 40 years just terrified
3953660	3959500	of women I I may have treated them poorly I certainly like thought of them in my head
3959500	3967820	wrongly but I are you I mean no way if I have thought about having a button installed on my
3967820	3972940	desk that would lock my door to keep people out while I jerk off thinking about a mannequin
3973500	3979980	uh I am I I will not hurt anyone you will not find out I've hurt anyone I am just scared
3980540	3985900	uh Jeff too cocky he would never I mean I just like to get along with people yeah
3986460	3988780	Spencer this seems like tempting fate right
3991100	3995340	say let's let's really tap that beastness well I was going to do comedy comes in threes because
3995340	4003100	I was going to say something like Spencer never leaves evidence yeah no I'm also terrified of
4003100	4011900	Spencer no loose ends critter that's what we call him old 50 gallon drum and uh crittenden
4011900	4016060	when I think of things I did wrong I remember like in seventh grade there was like a hair on
4016060	4021260	the back of this girl's shirt and I wanted to take it off but you know like I didn't do it
4021980	4027260	I I touched her back instead and then I was like I'm I'm I'm the worst oh man I've done awful things
4027260	4031660	like that I look back on I just to clear the air what did we just say because it was jinxing it
4031660	4038620	I'm I'm undoing the joke it's a joke I'm sorry like when I was like 19 years old I went on a
4038620	4044140	date with a girl and I remember like I pulled her back into the car for like like like she
4044140	4050220	clearly didn't wanna like a mart uh like a fifth tan and like I mean I just I feel horrified even
4050220	4055500	sick the thing is like I don't like I'm like saying those words out loud it's like oh Jesus
4055500	4060140	you pull like like what you did what but I never said the words out loud it's like but it's a thing
4060140	4069580	that I did like I I didn't like it was just like I I it wasn't like hateful but it was like I grabbed
4069580	4074540	I grabbed and I clinged and I was like I was like come on don't go you know like like she decided
4074540	4083020	the date was over you know yeah so there's one like if we go back that far and uh you know if
4083020	4088940	they if they find out also you've been fucking everyone's mama for as long as this podcast has
4088940	4093020	been going on I mean you've been pretty candid about that what else have I done
4097660	4102140	I think you fucked someone's mama on the lawn that was MC John I think if I think if you get
4102140	4108140	into ex-girlfriends like I just think or or and definitely web bookmarks like I'm just in big
4108140	4115100	trouble are you are you complicit in victimization because otherwise I think you're in the clear no
4115100	4118540	but I think but when you hear about like inappropriate behavior that means like the
4118540	4124460	surf is getting close to my cabana right because I don't know what inappropriate behavior is that
4124460	4129900	you just see that in the headline if that I I always I keep telling myself well that I hope that
4129900	4135900	means uh touching and like forcing and like things that have like a clear line around them because
4135900	4141900	if it starts to become like uh well that joke wasn't very funny but he kept then he doubled down
4141900	4146540	on it and he kept telling that joke you know like like stuff that's like a legitimate grievance like
4146540	4151340	I don't know there's probably people out there with stories you know that Al Franken thing it's kind
4151340	4155900	of weird I was arguing with someone on twitter about this and I think they turned out to be right
4155900	4161020	but they were mad because people were kind of lumping the two allegations together the groping
4161020	4168700	allegation and the kissing allegation and Al Franken has kind of denied the severity although
4168700	4174620	he apologized about the groping thing because it was like this was a staged photo or whatever
4174620	4180380	but then he kind of just said as for the kiss I don't remember that but that's arguably a more
4180380	4186140	egregious offense because it includes potentially forcing his tongue down into her mouth which is
4186140	4190300	like that's it's pretty gross and the person was saying that lumping them together means that
4190300	4194060	wouldn't get taken separately and then people would focus on the groping which is easier to dismiss
4194060	4198540	and so you're kind of you know you know dealing with that way but we really kind of don't talk
4198540	4207020	about that part of it which is to me a lot more uh aggressive I know but every time we start
4207020	4214060	talking about it we're it's it if we if we're saying anything other than look I I did something
4214060	4220780	I I'm thinking differently whatever like it's like like it you can only have these conversations
4220780	4229900	about like what anything that mitigates the idea of of a of a of a claim is like kind of
4229900	4235260	that's a hot stove for who knows how long I don't know how long that stove will stay just like bright
4235260	4242060	red hot I'm not I'm not touching it I did it was good I just think I thought the same thoughts
4242060	4246780	though it's a bummer because well one one thing is hearsay and one thing is like but I and I talked
4246780	4252940	about that last week where it was like that the the weird thing about it is that I felt I I could
4252940	4259020	put my I found myself becoming like a weird liberal version of a Roy Moore supporter almost
4259020	4265660	like in this it's it's like a microcosm thing because it was like as soon as I started freaking
4265660	4270220	out about net neutrality and thinking that there was a political reason for any of this then I
4270220	4275260	immediately started going like well what if this woman's just lying you know right and the and the
4275580	4284300	and the phrase what if this woman's just lying has to be a I think of well well my rule to my game
4284300	4289900	I'm playing is that's not a that's not a conch that's available yeah that's behind glass for
4289900	4293260	about five years but you don't know whenever I hear they all clear like you know you're not
4293260	4297180	advertising that though you're just explaining your thought process if thoughts enter your head
4297180	4302380	that's just kind of you can't stop that it's how you deal with those thoughts and yeah and I don't
4302380	4305980	think you've been like that's why I would put a button on my desk I locked my door
4307420	4310060	can't control thoughts I just think like thinking here
4313260	4319100	just to be clear again it's to keep people out and not to keep people in when I went to the
4319820	4325740	University of Southern California like I had I stayed in the dorm where a lot of film student
4325740	4336220	kids were and mostly guys uh that that I met anyway um if those guys a lot of whom were rich
4337660	4344300	kids that are going to go on to have like lots of access and lots of power in the film community
4346380	4354300	if they ever were going to be the Harvey Weinsteiny kind of gropey rapey asshole gross guy
4355100	4362860	um I think it's a huge part of like men going into positions of power or the government or film
4363500	4370060	and like I can control what women do like I can make them I have you can tell them to do things
4370060	4374940	yeah I can make them do things that they might not want to do because I I'm in a position to
4374940	4381260	affect their lives and careers um I don't care how many people have to fucking go down with
4381500	4385100	with the shape of like all these allegations right now I would like to think that if you're
4385100	4390700	in a film school right now and you're a young man going through film school and thinking of being
4390700	4396780	a producer or a director um you watch your fucking step now because if you do anything
4396780	4402460	that's cause for fucking retirement is like instantly if if if you haven't thought about
4402460	4407180	it and that's maybe one of the reasons that you haven't thought about is the reason why you want
4407180	4416300	to uh rap or make movies or ride a unicycle or I think that like for guys it can be a super
4416300	4421740	unspoken super unchallenged thing like yeah yeah well society signals that that's what we should
4421740	4427180	be doing it's it's it's something that we've been allowed to not think about for like 60,000 years
4427180	4432940	there's been no sort of damocles over your head like you were allowed to do it and the worst case
4432940	4437420	scenario that you had a reputation but I mean the media has said the signal that you're a bad
4437420	4441340	you're a downtrodden protagonist because you don't have a job and you don't have a girl and
4441340	4445500	then you go through a journey and you get a job and that gets you a girl and that's succeeding
4445500	4449820	at life that's what we tell people they should do you should get a job because a job will get
4449820	4454300	you a girl and that's you know and there's no agency in that but I think that that's the signal
4454300	4458860	we've been saying through storytelling for years and years and you know we're only just starting
4458860	4462460	to realize those are the signals we've been sending and that's not necessarily what we should
4462460	4468220	be doing although that's still mainly the story underlying a lot of stories is they they go and
4468220	4473580	do some tasks that then gives them professional acumen and a woman yeah oh go ahead no we were
4473580	4477580	talking about that the other day too like that's the 80s movie thing where you're supposed to root
4477580	4485020	for the underdog who's still a white man but he is like the beta male and his enemy he's the default
4485020	4488700	he's the base of like the lowest you can be as a nerd in a school and even if you're
4489500	4495740	white and straight and affluent like you deserve whatever you're able to get so if you're able to
4495740	4501900	beat the jock then the the getting the girl is your prize and you've earned it like because
4501900	4508700	you're saying the same yeah even in the most woke 80s culture it was it's like the alpha males uh
4509660	4518780	aryan girlfriend who's classically uh uh beautiful that the pro a nerd protagonist wants the whole
4518780	4525260	movie is then uh the third act as he realizes that he should have the woman that he had the
4525260	4532140	whole time his best friend who's got maybe shorter darker hair and but it's all it's like the
4532140	4536540	unspoken thing if it's because you watch a movie like that you're 10 years old that's the 80s and
4536540	4543820	you go this movie has a pretty good value system like it taught me not to uh go for this uh judge a
4543820	4549660	book by its cover because why you know this daphne oh you can fall for these things i'm like oh but
4549660	4556380	it's boof that i want i she's my best buddy it uh that's a that's the that's teen wolf uh the
4556380	4563020	original movie uh this is once you once you i wrote that movie it's saying like uh like kira's
4563020	4567020	journey wise like once you become fully self-actualized that's when you get to have a
4567020	4572140	girl when in real life exactly it's a reward becoming a real person that's exactly the point
4572140	4578620	yes you know having a girl in your life who makes you smarter it's a reward forget about the way uh
4578620	4582620	miller we all we've always known that budweiser was lying to us by telling us that if we drank
4582620	4587260	budweiser we get laid like we've we've all been smart enough to know that we've made fun of that
4587340	4593340	if we have a over over a certain tax bracket or iq but the thing that i think the smartest of us
4593340	4600140	like don't got away with not thinking about is that idea that that that part of of uh fulfillment
4600140	4610300	in general spiritual fulfillment even is acquisition of a female yeah is is like a coupling up and uh
4610300	4614220	and it's yeah whatever okay we've we've we've we've we did a good job that's the thing in every
4614220	4620380	mythology it's coming back from like there's the oneness and then you know in the you know
4620380	4625580	adam and eve story it's like man makes uh god makes man androgynous and then they split apart
4625580	4629580	and then the whole journey is like they're they're half of each other and then they have to come back
4629580	4635980	and realize like you know the and then like the father and the i'm i'm mixing uh things but like
4635980	4641100	the father and the mother the same thing it's all the oneness that's like when you become fully
4641100	4650300	self-actualized and this like the fulfillment of the self is realizing the male and female in those
4650300	4655260	heteronormative terms are two parts of the one yeah and there's a syndrome there because i don't
4655260	4660060	know why i'm bothering to even look out at a landscape of shit as if i didn't write a pilot
4660060	4666380	where joel mccale plays a guy who the the thing that is driving was he's trying to fuck britta
4666380	4673260	so he's doing everything that all of my uh sexual role models did in the movies that i grew up on
4673260	4680700	that that that socialized me which is he's lying to a woman to try to trick her into fucking him
4680700	4689580	because if he does that he'll he'll be happier he's and it's romantic uh because he oh look
4689580	4695980	how befuddled and and and what a what a crazy tangled web he's weaving oh you men you're so
4695980	4701900	you're you're willing to do so much just to get that sweet pussy uh it's like it's like we look
4701900	4708860	i looked at it as like like oh well this is what drives us all it's like wanting a hamburger so i'm
4708860	4713900	worried about writing a sitcom what's motivating this protagonist so i did the same thing in the
4713980	4719500	21st century that i had grown up on which is just like and and and if you ultimate you ultimately
4719500	4727500	make it clear that the that the the the uh superior male role model male role model is
4727500	4735020	abed like over jeff who doesn't have those same like as the two parts of that male part not that
4735020	4738700	you know abed is specific maybe throughout the lifetime of the show but i'm explaining the first
4738700	4743660	six episodes of that show which is basically like the same old john hughs slash kevin smith slash
4743660	4749740	whatever it's just it's just you're you're a man you you want to get that woman that's but part of
4749740	4753740	that that i think that that's like guys like me they're just like well i want to write a tv show
4753740	4759260	i want to write a movie i want it to i i need to i need to motivate this character it's like oh
4759260	4765900	well let's put a bone in front of the dog so it goes around the whole circle and and like it you
4765900	4774620	when you know not realizing that you're you're fundamentally like you're not even like you're
4774620	4779500	going to work with a box around you that you didn't even know you had around you like and then
4779500	4783340	you're and then you think you're making these decisions but you're like inside this box anyways
4783340	4787900	i'm glad this topic is unavoidable i'm glad that we've we've talked about it consistently for the
4787900	4793500	last uh fucking whatever i hope we talk about it for another year and if if you hate every time
4793500	4798700	it comes up uh then you're a rapist and i hope we keep talking about it as a group of white men
4799260	4804140	yeah i i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope every time we do it i'm serious
4804140	4811580	i hope someone ends the conversation with with that punchline no i'm serious oh i thought you
4811580	4817820	were i i'm gonna have it if if we start talking about this there's a not white guy on stage
4817900	4822940	i'm gonna shut it down all right because what more can we add to the perspective i've been
4829100	4830460	sweet sweetie we're trying to do a show
4834060	4840860	yeah i've been doodling over here i i drew a kind of a bad giraffe i drew i think like
4841820	4848220	like some sort of prince with a turban on his head all right how much dnd time do we have left we got
4848220	4854940	most of it all right so it let's let's thank rob tantrum for uh his his lyrical madness
4856140	4866140	rob tantrum giraffe facts given giraffe facts people don't know that giraffes wear giraffe slacks
4866140	4875180	i think i'm conflicted about the do we have to have a no applause rule because when nine
4875180	4880460	people applaud it just sounds like then then everyone hears the nine people i don't think
4880460	4885580	it's gonna hit the microphones either way i think if you hear all right in the background i'm gonna
4885580	4889820	listen to it again yeah i know you don't want to you don't want to like walk around with a baseball
4889820	4895900	bat and go okay guys there was a lot of laughter and applause last time do we have levy here yeah
4895900	4907260	let's bring him up is levy here steve levy bring it more white dudes on the stage it's white guy
4907260	4917180	time again but at least i'm like somewhat of a my i'm on a minority right yeah you're the jewish paul
4919180	4923260	paul newman was jewish i thought we established we are now we are now officially as diverse as
4923260	4929340	the white house now that you're still the jewish paul newman i'll take it just because
4929340	4937820	he's also jewish doesn't make him more jewish than you okay i'm just trying to diminish your
4937820	4943740	sexiness in any way i can i don't know why that's the way to do it i mean paul newman's a great
4943740	4950060	looking guy i'm trying to kind of soft like like lob you a compliment and what wasn't paul newman
4950060	4956060	when he was young wasn't he kind of like was he blonde he was me too bro he was always kind of
4956060	4962940	well we were all you mean like as a toddler until i was like seven maybe me too i think that's how
4962940	4968140	babies work i was strong i was strawberry blonde that if that's the thing i had reddish blonde hair
4968140	4972540	they say that's one of the things and by they i mean uh i think the person who wrote the intro
4972620	4979980	to playboy's blondes brunettes and redheads uh to 1989 uh that they uh we associate blonde hair with
4980940	4984860	with uh youth and by youth i guess they meant babies
4987180	4993740	my beard grows in red sometimes and my mustache is blonde that's cool it's crazy right there's
4993740	4998300	only one thing that makes me sad about watching my body you're like you're like paul newman
4999100	5005500	i miss my beard you think one day your beard's already back no i miss the red i miss i i'm fine

5061500	5065100	you think one day i'll have a super successful food business
5066540	5071100	i think you're gonna really succeed in salad dressings and spaghetti sauces cool
5071100	5076460	that's exactly what i was looking for paul newman passed away didn't he no yeah
5077420	5082300	he did unfortunately yeah i think he did well paul newman died pretty sure it was a while ago

5100140	5102140	oh
5103740	5106220	does it make you any less jewish moving paul newman

5147580	5153420	much work are you at your ideal hair length or do you no i don't know i think my hair is at a length
5153420	5157900	where it starts to become split ends and kind of disintegrates on its own so it's not really
5157900	5161820	because hair will stop on its own well if you cut off those split ends it'll keep growing you can
5161820	5166700	make it grow quite long all right i might sometimes i think about what spencer would look like if he
5166700	5174060	did like the boy band spiked hair you know i'd look like joey fatone because he's got so much
5174060	5180060	how high would it go oh like spike it up and frost it was like paul from tecan frosty tips

5219020	5224220	have to ask if you're dead yeah yeah he's got a license to print money for a while and he fucking
5224220	5233740	squandered it come on i think i think i i i think that maybe i'm guessing yahoo serious was a victim
5233740	5242860	of like some shit he wasn't ready for like i think i think i think some dudes from william morris
5242860	5249660	like went down to an open mic you call that a contract this is a contract and he was like well
5249660	5256060	if you really think so and they're like oh we think so and then like he was probably 11 years old
5256060	5260220	sponge mckenzie made more money in one year than i've ever made in my life it was there was a time
5260220	5264940	when australian things were really fucking hot wait sponge mccunjoo was australian wasn't he
5264940	5271340	what oh i'm thinking jacko suppose mckenzie was an english bulldog i take that back remember jacko
5272780	5277180	the battery guy yeah we remember jacko all right spencer do you want to fucking uh take us back
5278060	5284460	i forget what happened last time i know i know i mean i remember but i don't totally remember
5285420	5293340	that's not what you just said he forgot yeah refresh refresh our mutual memory
5295500	5304460	last time on harmontown our heroes were on the quest for pageants gem going along with pageants
5304460	5310220	to the nearby town of door nester they encountered geffen that guy that they'd met a couple times at
5310220	5317180	this point geffen was headed to door nester as well because he suspected the church was on weed
5318300	5323980	then uh you guys went to the town and you saw some crazy things in the form of zombies and
5323980	5331980	skeletons they seemed bummed out in a graveyard because music was playing from a harp diarrhea
5331980	5337820	junior tried to inspect the harp music but it vanished in a flash of ruby light and then the
5337900	5345580	zombies attacked like they were uh mindless zombies they were dispatched in short order
5345580	5351180	as morning broke it was time to enter door nester and they met the guards at the front gate
5351740	5358780	applying various methods they got in the front gate and then they decided that they'd split up
5358780	5365020	but met up and decided that they wouldn't split up or maybe would that's where they are now
5365820	5374300	follow them today what will they do how will they succeed patchins gem now
5379820	5385180	perfectly timed did the camera see that i was like pinching my nipple because i definitely
5385180	5391100	was that whole time i was reading and assuming i was on camera it would be with your left hand
5392060	5397500	yeah like this is that a thing you do i guess it seems to be right now did i it seems normal did
5397500	5404460	i ever tell you guys on this podcast that i my doctor was giving me a testicular exam and my
5404460	5411420	hand drifted up to my this is like like like just instinctively like because i was like because
5411420	5417660	someone because there was shit going on with my crotch it's like one time and i i i think it was
5417660	5423100	like i it's like he's like all right i'll just check it out like and he's and i think it was
5423100	5429980	probably something like i went like like like it was just like amazing to me that i would like
5429980	5437740	like it would there must be some sort of like like youthful comfort mechanism yeah that's what
5437740	5442140	i think it is i think it's just some weird yeah or a middle-aged comfort mechanism i don't know
5442140	5449740	when i when i when nipples became so important to my bedroom life but they did they did that
5449740	5456860	that round was bended like i did for sure it's like because like like nothing goes on
5456860	5461900	in harmontown without a nipple being involved i saw this like therapist or something she was
5461900	5467420	like a weird lady because she like had this mailer that's like don't use any scented shampoo or wear
5467420	5471980	any cologne before you come in the office and stuff like which is just a weird thing for like
5471980	5478460	an anxiety doctor or something because it's like anxiety inducing but we were sitting in the the
5478460	5484620	office and i had my hands in my lap and then she was like do you always cover your genitals with
5484620	5489580	your hands it's like i just where do i put my hands and then i tried a bunch of different things
5489580	5495500	like to this side to this side to both sides like it's like people put their hands in their lap
5495500	5500860	and that's when you started doing this i was doing i was picking different places to put my
5500860	5505820	hands so fast that my knees just started moving on their own i got a pet peeve about that shit
5506620	5513260	the smell stuff no the therapeutic technique of asking you stupid questions of just going like
5513260	5517340	did you notice when i asked you that question your voice got a little quieter or you know look at
5517340	5522620	your body language right now or like one time one time cody and i were in couples therapy and cody
5522620	5530380	wanted to put a pillow uh the therapist stepped out of the room and cody put a pillow between us
5530380	5535660	and then the therapist uh said she came back in she said see right away i think it's really
5535660	5541100	important that to notice that cody's created a barrier between the two of you cody told me later
5541100	5546460	she was farting and she didn't want to she was she was worried about farting and like getting it
5546460	5551980	i was like it's like the i just i just like and then when we told the therapist that a week later
5551980	5557260	because i was like you have to tell her that right you weren't creating a barrier you were
5557260	5564540	protecting me from your farts that's adorable and intimate and uh and then when we told her that she
5564540	5568540	of course she had to double down and go like well do you think maybe she basically said do you think
5568540	5574140	the reason you were farting so much is because you needed a it was like all right a lot of this
5574140	5579100	stuff is like cold reading stuff it's like let's try to make sense of our occupation here's the
5579100	5583980	thing i'm a fucking like you know the reason i'm going like this and going like this isn't always
5583980	5591500	because i'm like being resistant to you or like yeah it's like i don't well i don't know this is
5591500	5596540	who i am you know like i could be like fucking like really open to you and like really i don't
5596540	5601580	know like yeah i i i talk to people all the time and like they die like young writers and go like
5601580	5605580	because they take like these seminars and stuff and part of it is like the the now the people tell
5605660	5610220	them like well when you pitch like like you should sit straight up and here's what you wear and all
5610220	5615100	this stuff i'm like no go in like a schlub you think they're looking for schlubs all right yeah
5615820	5622460	i always analyze people's body posture and then go this is stupid like so is that your first notice
5622460	5627420	spencer that you were touching nipples during your your no that was just my hands in my lap it was
5627420	5632140	like and i do that all the time and then every time i do it i think about it i mean the nipples
5632140	5636460	just now during your your opening read no i i've probably done that while i was driving it's not
5636460	5640540	like a sexual thing but it's just like yeah i guess something that happens you're not gonna
5640540	5646380	deny that it feels good it does like that i mean it doesn't feel as good as i always expect it to
5646380	5651500	which is maybe why i keep trying my nipples are too sensitive i'm not a nipple guy yeah that's what
5651500	5656940	i'm saying oh no too sensitive well then well then you know work on your fucking approach man
5656940	5661820	so you pinch your nipple no i don't pinch it's not like uh you rub you rub a little stocking
5661820	5666060	foot on your nipple no i don't wear a stocking no you rub a mannequin like i was like how would
5666060	5674700	that fit like uh i don't i look i i look just there's there's nipple play if you go to bed
5674700	5678700	with me now i don't know when it started i don't know if it was a gradual thing i don't know
5678700	5684620	but i know it's full on now now it's just it's man is it i don't want to say mandatory it's not
5684620	5689340	mandatory it's just like if you love me you're gonna learn like i i just can't there be a sexual
5689340	5694460	encounter with you or there's no nipple playing right is that is that a lost dan does not go for
5694460	5701820	that i just i yeah i i'll i'll do anything if i'm in love with you oh right well what i don't
5701820	5707180	you can poop on me i don't if you need me to not touch my nipples or what am i you want to not touch
5707180	5712620	my ass like all right anyways i'm just saying sorry pretty funny i got a guy giving me a
5712620	5717340	trying to see if i have cancer and i fucking because a hand went towards my groin i my
5717340	5721420	other hand like shot up to my nipple i just okay so we're all we're all through the front
5721420	5726540	gate of dornister right yeah you're kind of let's say you're you're kind of in the shadow of this
5726540	5733020	gate the the guards seem pretty sleepy and they went back to sleep and they're currently asleep
5733020	5737340	all right so carlos i know the the plan was that we were gonna come in separately yeah it was a
5737340	5743740	whole thing it did but you know here we are let's let's just move ahead but we can now we can still
5743740	5748060	do what we wanted to do because the guards don't give a shit they're sleepy this is this is my
5748060	5754300	thought i think i don't want to over explain it it's just that like we're in this town we don't
5754300	5762460	really know what we're looking for and more importantly we're we know there's something
5762460	5768860	afoot in this town we like we need information and we need to like i feel like it's a disadvantage
5768860	5775020	for us to be perceived as a group let alone a group of church officials why don't we why don't
5775020	5780540	we right now split up and take like different parts of the town different like maybe i'll go
5780540	5786620	into the tavern or you go into the thing like we'll all pick a like spencer what buildings
5786620	5793180	do we see in front of us uh the two seconds like my pitch is well he looks yeah good call my pitch
5793180	5801100	is uh it's gonna be harder for me to pretend i'm not a cleric you know i'm i it's you should go
5801100	5806940	go go frequent the taverns or whatever i i think i'll go to the local uh church and just to be
5806940	5811900	clear unless you guys get disguises you might have plain clothes with you but you're generally
5811900	5817820	adorned and kind of church church oriented garments so unless you do something about that
5817820	5823420	you will register as some church people of some sort hmm we should go shopping
5824540	5833020	shopping what a girl wants what a girl needs all over the world
5833980	5838540	spencer what time is it oh and it's like hell yeah it's uh early morning no it's not early
5838540	5844300	morning it's like maybe 10 10 a.m at this point so shops are open shops shops will be open let's
5844380	5849740	let's go into a little clothing store let's pretend we don't know each other well you guys yeah because
5849740	5854780	i don't i'm i'm gonna go i'm gonna go check out the the the church is there a church of the silver
5854780	5863820	flame there sure is i'll go there you guys go shopping and then and then split up we don't need
5863820	5870860	to split up we're not wearing church clothes you you currently are then you're gonna go shopping
5870860	5875100	together yeah then you're gonna split up like cisco and ebert at the end of at the movies like
5875100	5880620	people are gonna know are there are there any vendors like selling garments like out in the
5880620	5888540	town like or do i have to go into like a dedicated clothing shop um there yeah there's like an open
5888540	5894700	air market that has some smaller shops and mostly stores so yeah so i go wandering around looking
5894700	5900940	for a clothing vendor to maybe find something to like disguise myself as maybe just a regular
5900940	5908140	citizen all right you find what late what's labeled by a wooden sign as the open air black market
5908140	5914220	there's a row of shops and stalls there's kind of two rows that flank this it's wider than a street
5914220	5920860	but it's it's kind of like a street um all the stalls that are open are are kind of guarded by
5920860	5926700	a couple shopkeepers that are keeping all their wares like hidden under cloths and sheets and stuff
5926700	5933180	so it's all like secret kind of secret wares most of these places are closed and shuttered
5933180	5938380	um it's very striking you you wonder if there's like a recession or something i take a couple
5938380	5943500	gold pieces out in my hand and i just kind of i'm kind of tossing them up and down like playing it
5943500	5949260	cool but like clearly somebody that's got some money to spend like whistling a little you know
5949260	5957100	a little tune all right um you see you see a familiar colorful like nice looking stall not
5957100	5962460	a stall it's like a cart it's a cart for the fabricators guild and there's a colorfully dressed
5962460	5967180	fabricator who's like he looks i don't know let's say he looks kind of like an apple employee and
5967180	5972700	he like he type A's over to you and is like hey there good sir check out my fabrication wares

6088380	6094060	assuming that if this is a town worth its salt that the church of the silver flame will have a
6095980	6101500	will have a keep or something that uh can be seen in the sky the skyline yeah it's one of the it's
6101500	6107580	the largest building in town but not by much it's still a pretty small uh a tiny church um it's
6107580	6113740	it's kind of there's only like a sanctuary and a couple a couple other like side rooms it's a pretty
6113740	6119340	small footprint of a building um it also doesn't have that you can see like a silver flame on
6119340	6126380	display like a big brazier it just has a bell tower like a small tiny church well i'll uh i
6126460	6133260	approach it all right the you see you see geffen's horse you see geffen's horse uh what do you call
6133260	6139900	it tied up outside of the church and inside you hear him yelling at people i eavesdrop for a moment
6139900	6145020	if i can make out what he's yelling he sounds like a drill sergeant like he's he's uh barking out
6145020	6153020	orders and you can just hear the sounds of of footfalls and and people moving so he's saying
6153020	6160860	like good move move it yeah you lousy lots you worthless louts do laps and run and keep it up
