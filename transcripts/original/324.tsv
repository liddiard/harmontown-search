0	13200	Welcome to Harmon Town. How are you tonight? You look so beautiful. I am Brandon Johnson.
13200	17840	I'm sitting in for the lovely Jeff Davis and we want to wish Sarah Hill a happy birthday.
17840	24400	We want to wish Steve Levy a happy birthday. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, let's bring him
24400	35760	out. He's renowned the best around, Dan Harmon. Followed by the most amazing Rob Schwab.
46320	49440	Happy birthday, Steve Levy. Steve Levy's birthday.
49440	51120	Sarah Hill. Steve Levy.
51120	57600	I never really texted him. Steve, happy birthday. We took care of it for you.
59040	62240	Fucked up. We assisted your assistance on his assistant.
62240	67200	I saw it on my calendar and then I, because Steve's the first guy I got a text in the morning
67200	75040	and I was like, well, get this stuff out of the way first. He should have left you a note.
75840	81680	Like a calendar? He's in charge of my calendar. His birthday was on it. He did the best he could
82720	90400	to humanize himself. He just couldn't get through the fucking membrane. Couldn't break the
91520	97680	titanium ceiling, the whatever material you use when you're just oppressing everyone human.
98800	104480	It's beyond glass. Glass is elegant. It's for the ladies. You want to be able to see
104480	110400	through it. Hello. I'm oppressing you. I can see through the ceiling. What, too soon?
114640	116240	If you guys think you're sick of me,
118400	126000	you should be sick of yourselves for a change. What would you use for Levy?
127520	131280	Oh, I don't know. I mean, obviously I'm using something that you can't see through.
132000	136800	I think that's my elegant point. I think that's where the term glass ceiling probably came from,
136800	144400	is that men are like, they're like, oh, it's transparent. Not because it's invisible,
144400	151920	but because the men are like, yeah, it's there. I can see you while I think it's insidious.
151920	157840	And then I'm saying, then what about the way that you oppress everybody that you don't even
157840	163760	think about at all? You don't even see them. I feel like women came up with the term.
166800	168080	Women came up with a term.
171120	175840	You know, because from their vantage point, it's a ceiling.
175840	188080	It's like a... But the show is called Harmon Town. And February is over. So I'll be quiet.
188080	189840	Happy March. Happy International Women's Month.
189840	197040	God damn right! Yeah. To a point well taken, the term ceiling probably
198000	206960	coined by the people beneath it. Unless you're that jazzed about oppression,
206960	212640	that you're like, we need a ceiling over these people. Looking down and going,
212640	216080	you don't call it a floor. Because you're a little concerned,
216080	219600	you don't want to oppress them too much. You want to be able to see them.
219600	224240	It's like the opposite of empathy. The opposite of love is indifference, not hate. The opposite of
224240	230560	empathy isn't non-empathy. It's like, I know exactly how you feel. I'm going to crush you.
232560	233120	That's crazy.
233120	238240	I'm thinking about things from your perspective so I can know how to hurt you more.
239680	241840	Is there a word for that? Antipathy?
241840	242400	Free time.
244960	249760	Speaking of antipathy, okay. So here's a phrase.
249760	258800	Ant-tiphathy. I remember going to my Ant-tiphathy's house for rhubarb pie
260720	265680	and mac and cheese-aronis. Ant-tiphathy.
266880	273280	Spencer's been very depressed lately. I asked him if it was okay to share that with people.
274000	278160	And he said, yeah. That was several weeks ago. I haven't checked in with him about
278160	284080	that since. I'm giving him his space. And he's like, I mean, I see him all the time.
284080	288400	But if somebody doesn't want to, you know, I figure, give him space.
290000	291200	Is that what you've been doing?
293040	302160	Oh, to you. No, you're here. You're interrupting with the Ant-tiphathy
302160	310000	wordplay reminded me that Spencer wasn't here. And that made me think about the fact
310000	313440	I actually hadn't shared something that I did ask Spencer at one point. Would you mind if I shared
313440	317280	that with the audience? He's like, yeah, I don't care. Because I didn't think it was interesting.
317280	326240	And I was in a real shit mood. And it's hard to say these days if it's connected to anything
327040	335040	extrinsically causal. The world is so wackadoodle from my perspective at this point. How would you
335040	344400	know if it was because it was raining or because of something you saw on the internet? But you ever
344400	348720	have one of those funks that's so deep that you're kind of like, this has got to be biochemical.
348720	353200	This can't even be. I've never been this depressed about anything real in my life. This has got to
353280	358080	just be a real thing. And it almost makes it a little easier to deal with intellectually
358080	364240	because you're like, oh, this is just blue crayon in my butt. Don't Google it, but it's a real
364240	372400	expression. And midway into that, I was not sharing it with people. That's the thing. Because it was
372400	382800	like, oh, this too shall pass. You complain enough. Who are you going to tell? Even saying this is
382800	387120	going to be uncharismatic. But I was having this conversation with a colleague where I said,
388240	394720	they were talking about being depressed. And I was like, you are having a lot of good fortune
394720	404400	right now. And there is an effect that I've noticed where that lasso of when you're allowed to
404400	408880	complain kind of tightens in your own mind. You guys are thinking, well, nothing's stopping you.
408960	413760	That lasso's not tight. But that's because I think I have this. I feel like I have a little
413760	426160	license to kvetch because I'm talking to people who would never judge me. But anyways, I got way
426160	433600	too high. I'm sorry. That's my fourth tangent. Spencer was so I came to work in this funk.
433600	437920	And I got out of my car. I got in the elevator. And Spencer happened to be in the elevator at
437920	443840	the same time. And he hadn't done the show for I think he just had taken one week off at that
443840	449760	point. And I said, good morning. He said, hey, sorry, I didn't do the show. And I was like,
449760	456320	yeah, is everything OK? He's like, I'm just I'm really depressed. And my mood, I was like so
456320	462880	excited. It was like he was like when you see somebody wearing the same shirt or like it or
462880	467760	somebody mentions the same Netflix show that you were like coming into work ready to talk about.
467760	475920	And like, like, like it was so instantly measurable how happy it made me to hear someone
475920	482320	else say, I've been depressed and I don't know why. And I think that that's both, you know,
483360	489200	look, I know that that's I know it was also funny. I was it was like, God, that's so ridiculous and
489200	494640	almost cruel that it makes you feel better. You hear the misery loves company and stuff.
494640	500640	And it's like, I I never bothered to ask Spencer, is it also making you feel better?
501840	507680	Or is it just I was afraid to ask, you know, you ever take like a swim class when the teacher says,
507680	516320	like, don't go near a person that's drowning. They they they they won't know what they're doing.
516320	522000	And they they might grab your head and hold it under them like like with their kind of reptile
522000	525440	part of their brain, if they're scared, they're that they're drowning. So you have to like have
525440	531120	these techniques. Like, I was I was that's what I was doing. I was like, I was like,
531120	536160	Spencer saying he had been depressed. Like, I just grabbed it and pushed myself up with it was like,
536160	542400	that makes me feel so much better. But there's a, you know, there is this thing, you've witnessed
542400	548800	somebody be brave, you're able to be brave. And there's this great honesty, you get you get a
548800	555120	little kick from that. We all do. It's why we sort of stress, reach out to people. So there is this
555120	559600	moment like when you peel, I know this is nerdy, but you know, when you open a band aid in the dark,
559600	564480	and you see that little spark when you peel the paper. I love that. Right. That's not nerdy. Okay,
564480	570640	that's so that's magic. Right. So this is the same. It is magic, right? It's the same thing.
570640	575360	It's the same thing in Carl's Bad Caverns, where there's no light. Yes. And then you open a band
575360	581280	aid and you like, yes, it's one little thing. And it doesn't, it doesn't mean you're going to
581280	586480	live longer. It doesn't mean anything. But it's like, it's, yeah, it's doesn't mean the wound,
586480	590640	doesn't mean the wound went away. That's like, you know, the opposite of you got to pull that
590640	597840	band aid off is usually you got to open that band aid package, open that band aid package.
597840	609600	And a one, two, okay. So antipathy reminded me of a like, a better time. You did that. That
609600	614960	reminded me of Spencer. Spencer reminded me. So I would say, I mean, I want to say also,
614960	619520	I don't think I have the word power right now. I'm on a deadline. I'm kind of like clumsy and
619520	624160	fumbling, but I did, I did imagine sharing it with you that Spencer's been bumped out. And I know
624160	630240	that, I know that Spencer's not going to enjoy anybody saying to him, like, you know, it's, it's,
630240	641120	it's tough with him. Like I, he's such a smart guy. Like, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
641920	651600	I, I, I feel like it's important to, to share that he's been in a, in a funk. I don't, even though I,
651600	656160	I'm sure he would, if he had a button, he'd go, well, no, then don't, don't mention it because
656160	662400	he's, he doesn't, he's not, I don't think he's going to get joy out of like a flood of
662400	670080	digital get Wells. You know, I, I, I do. Even if we don't, well, let's see what happens. Well,
670080	675040	sometimes that's how I felt about wishing him a happy birthday was, I kind of, I was like, you
675040	679680	know, well, he probably hates having happy birthday said to him, but this isn't for him.
680640	684800	When did, when did he tell you he was a miserable motherfucker who hated good shit?
684800	689200	No, he didn't tell me he's a pretty love and light kind of guy as far as I've seen and,
689200	694480	and get sort of that you get what you give and, and that, yeah, I don't mean to make him sound
694480	702480	like a curmudgeon. I think he's, he's, he's not, no, he's just very, he doesn't like, he's shy.
703200	708400	Yeah. He's like, I don't want to say social anxieties because the term, I mean,
709280	714640	is it an anxiety if you don't want to be in a crowd of fucking warbling strangers? I, I, it's
714640	719440	like, it's like when people used to say, I had a Christ complex. How do you know I'm not actually
719440	728640	Christ? It's true. Those shoes. Did you ever, this is a kind of a tangential thing, but,
728640	732400	did you ever go to like Milwaukee days? Do you guys have any of those festivals?
732400	735680	Summerfest. Summerfest. Were you that kind of person who could do those?
736480	744560	Uh, I mean, yeah. We were back in the comedy tent. I mean, we would traverse like the crowds,
745120	750640	but we wouldn't stay there very long and spend the rest of the day or the night in the comedy
750640	755840	tent. I don't think I would have gone to Summerfest very often if, if it wasn't, if we didn't have
755840	760720	that, like, yeah, that little feeling of like you're going there to work and, and there's a,
760880	766640	yeah, there's a, there's like this hidden area full of all the people that you see every day,
766640	771600	plus the occasional Bobcat Goldway. Third time Kenny are going to show up and you can hang out
771600	775760	with them. So Comic Con is the same. When you guys are Comic Con, you don't really walk. I can't,
775760	781840	I can't do the exhibit floor anymore except for maybe like Sunday before they, like after they
781840	787280	close and it's like, it's really, that's, that's pretty crazy. I think everyone would agree,
787280	792640	but I think some people are maybe just more able to handle something that they know is egregious,
792640	798720	which is like absolute zero control over your personal space and where, and when you walk and
798720	805840	don't walk, like that gets, that's pretty, that seems, that seems criminal. The, the exhibit floor
805840	811920	at Comic Con. Anyways. All right. So yeah. Okay. So this has been a long time coming.
812320	816800	I think I've, I think I've been thinking about this for 30 years and I, I, it's like one of those
816800	822400	things. It's just a little thing in my, a little be in my bonnet that I think it's come up recently
822400	827360	because of the amount of true crime I'm listening to. So this phrase gets used a lot. I hate this
827360	840240	phrase. There's no guest tonight. So fuck you. Welcome to the show. Oh God. Oh God. I guess I
841120	848880	won't be talking when I shouldn't talk anymore. I guess it's always my turn to say something
848880	862800	about myself. You're going to fuck that up. I, I accidentally read the fucking Reddit before I
862800	871280	came. It's because I started going back there for porn. And like, I, I, I, I like the gone wild
871280	877520	audio. You ever do the gone wild audio? It's, it's like a, you can't get that anywhere else. It's like
877520	883120	a, it's like an open source community of people that are just doing like audio porn. So like
883120	888240	role-playing stuff like, like, well, hello, you're here for your three o'clock appointment. Just sit
888240	894160	over here. What do you mean you're French? I don't, I, I made, I make, I'm making one up because
894160	899920	I've been conditioned now to not share like what I'm going there for. Is there, is there a Michael
899920	909760	Winslow? The Michael Winslow of, of gone wild audio. It is, it is fascinating which people decide to
909760	917680	use props. It's, it's very funny. Like, like sometimes like, like, like, like, like women who,
917680	923760	who like, where did you get the impression it would sound like that to fillet someone? Like, like,
923760	929520	like, like, like, are you, are you, are you really good at it? Is that why it sounds like that? Have
929520	935120	you heard everyone else pretending to flight? Like, like, like, like, why does it sound like, like,
935120	938880	and then the other people, like, whether or not they're going to do space work and like, here,
938880	944320	let me, why don't you sit in this chair? And then some people just aren't content to let that be
944320	950480	silent. There's, there's like a chair sound, which is actually more distracting to me because I'm
950480	955280	picturing them like, like putting their foot on a chair or something. It's like they're a one-man
955280	963920	band or a, it's like a fully act from SCTV or something. Like, they got cowbells next to them.
963920	970320	And it's like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. What are you doing with that finger?
972880	975760	I can't seem to maintain my erection.
978320	985600	Gotta shake this lightning paper. There was, there was, there was one that I kind of was like,
985600	993040	um, it, it involved, uh, two women. There's like, there's, there's codes that, that, that they use
993040	1002080	that they put brackets. And so it'll be like F4M, it means female voice recorded for a male listener,
1002080	1008720	assuming heterosexuality, I suppose the, uh, and then it's M4F, which I should listen to a couple
1008800	1015760	guys. I'm sort of like, like, like, I've never actually heard like a M4F. Like, like, like that
1015760	1021840	seems like that would be a whole world of like, I should do one. I, I, I like, uh, right now.
1027200	1037040	Shoes for sale. Hello. Uh, what? Oh. All right. No, let me, we're like five tangents deep. I just
1037120	1042240	want to, I want to get to this thing, but I, I went, I went to the, uh, I went to the subreddit
1042240	1050080	and it was like, like, oh, like somebody was like, well, I listened to all 800 episodes and, uh, uh,
1050080	1054080	I'm all caught up. And then everyone was like, I can read that thread. That's not going to hurt me.
1054640	1058960	That's going to be like a fucking warm embrace that not even sugar coated. It's just going to
1058960	1063520	be like a general, what do you, you know, 800 episodes. And then it was just like everybody's
1063520	1067440	chance to just go like, well, when you get to this one, that's when it really bad and all this
1067440	1072720	town was like, I don't, I don't, I just can't, can you still say suck my dick? Like, are you,
1072720	1077280	so is it, is it like, is it like, is that like a suck my, you know, just to say suck my dick to
1077280	1082960	people as a way of saying like, go fuck yourself. Or is, is that, is that, is that, is that problematic
1082960	1090000	because, but anyone can suck a dick, right? No, it takes a real genius. Um,
1094160	1102480	for the clip show, that one's for the 600th anniversary special. Um, so no, you got better.
1102480	1105760	You got better than suck my dick. Yeah. No, I mean, I imagine it's just like,
1105760	1110080	even if it's not technically, I'm not one of these guys. It's like, is this, is this technically like,
1110080	1113920	we're still allowed to, I just, I was just kind of thinking about it. Cause I'm like,
1113920	1119680	I note that more than ever. Like I used to have a real addiction to like saying the F word, like,
1119680	1124960	as the gay derogatory F word, like just real conversationally, like probably all over this
1124960	1129600	podcast, I bet. Cause I was like, it was a hard habit to break. Like, like, like, uh,
1129600	1130400	Isn't that crazy?
1130400	1136960	Yeah. I mean, it's a lot of shit, shit changes fast and, uh, and just gay and retarded all over
1136960	1145040	the place. And, um, and, uh, the, the, so therefore I, um, um, I'm, I guess what I'm,
1145040	1150160	um, the thing, okay. Well, I guess my point is that the thing that the out of all the habits
1150160	1156320	that have feel like I've successfully killed verbally, uh, the, the thing that remains
1156320	1160240	rattling against the inside of my skull constantly is I'm constantly wanting to just tell people to
1160240	1165280	suck my dick. Like I haven't lost that. Even though I have, I don't know, I don't say it anymore.
1165280	1169760	It hasn't gone away. Like the craving, I just like feel like it's the thing that I really
1169760	1175360	want to say to everyone all the time. This is not my dick. Like, like, come on.
1175360	1176160	You got better.
1176160	1179920	But yeah, of course we've all got better. We could all do better.
1179920	1183920	Some of us don't, but, but really, you know, there's a couple, because of the great thing
1183920	1189120	about suck my dick sort of being retired, there's all these new ways of saying awful shit to people.
1189120	1193840	Oh yeah. Well, did you, I was, did you see John Mulaney's, uh, uh, set, the SNL set?
1194720	1200560	I mean, it's like, I, I, I, I, it, it, it, it was really striking to me. Cause it was like,
1200560	1205120	you know, this is like debates about like political correctness. Is it killing comedy,
1205120	1210080	blah, blah, blah. And it's like, it, it, it's a non-question. It's just like, like you, the,
1211040	1214720	the answer is sort of like, do you, if you watch John Mulaney's set on Saturday Night Live,
1215360	1221040	feel the craft, feel the, the unmistakable kind of objective humor. If there is such a thing,
1221040	1227120	like he kills it. It's what you might call like just a, just a, just a perfect set,
1227120	1234000	solid set. Like, uh, and, and then, and then you do like, oh, do you think that he did this,
1234000	1241680	do you think he wrote and performed this by first having a debate about, um, whether he's allowed to
1241680	1246000	say things? The answer is no. I mean, if you haven't seen it, I'll answer for you. It's, it's,
1246320	1253440	it's clearly coming from a place of joy. It just doesn't go into air. It's, it's, it's, he,
1253440	1259680	he's not, he's not either mad that, that the times have changed, nor is he, uh, like
1260720	1270000	wantonly stoked about, uh, the, the new way to think things and stuff. He's just nailing it,
1270000	1273920	doing it. And I think it just has to do with like sincerity and kind of like being in the moment,
1273920	1279840	which I can no longer do, but here's my, uh, uh, here's the thing that I would like to change
1279840	1286160	about language because I feel like it has antipathy, inherent antipathy to it. This phrase,
1286160	1295360	I don't like it. I'd like to eliminate it. Uh, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
1295360	1303920	Suck my dick. Like, like, like, well, first of all, forget about the fact, I'm not, I'm not,
1303920	1309120	forget about the fact that if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you probably nailed it.
1309120	1314400	Right. You probably avoided something terrible. I always, I just think verbally, but forget about
1314400	1321360	that. Like, like, cause if you're already in the wrong place, so you don't want to be, you don't
1321360	1325200	want to be there at the right time. It's the wrong place. The right time to be there is something
1325360	1331360	wrong is going to happen. Right. Forget about that. I just don't like the general, like, it
1331360	1335040	was just like, like, like, I don't like the general like way that it's used where it's always like,
1336560	1340560	yeah, I guess, I guess, I guess the term is victim blaming now. Um, where it's like, like,
1340560	1348000	because it's just like something horrible happens in these, uh, uh, podcast you're listening to,
1348000	1353920	or you're like, Oh, then you got ripped in half by a gator or the, the true crime podcast. Yeah.
1353920	1359120	And you're just listening because you're like, Oh God, I, I, I hope nothing bad ever happens to me.
1359120	1364000	And, uh, I don't know why you're listening. It was just slowly going insane. And, uh,
1364000	1368960	it's just constantly saying that over and over again. Like the people are just in the wrong
1368960	1375760	place at the wrong time. Like, like the, the, the, the idea that if I die tragically, that's,
1375760	1381760	that's the way it will be characterized. It kind of really makes me mad in advance. Like my,
1382160	1386320	I want to haunt people. I wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong time. If I get hit by a bus,
1387040	1393120	I, I, I, it was, it, it, it was, it was, it was, it was a bad thing that happened.
1393840	1398240	I mean, do you have, if you have plans on how you want to die, then sure. We can judge you.
1399040	1404480	Like if you were like, man, I wanted to die somewhere sexy, but I was at a gas station at
1404480	1412240	like three. Right. It's the wrong place at the wrong time type of death that I wanted. Yeah.
1412240	1416880	You know, I wanted something bigger. You know, the wrong place for the kind of activity I had in
1416880	1422480	mind. Right. Right. Yeah. That's like, let's say it is like the wrong place at the wrong time. Again,
1422480	1426960	just to come back to that, it is like saying two left. I mean, like you're, you're, you've now
1426960	1433760	turned right. Yeah. Because obviously it was the wrong time. Yeah. It was already the wrong place.
1433760	1438640	Yeah. Just don't be, don't be the right place at the wrong time. What's the other one? However,
1438640	1442480	it doesn't work in reverse. If you're at the right place in the right time, you're in the best place.
1446400	1451760	I think it works the way zeros in math do probably or integers or whatever they call them. Two
1451760	1460560	negatives. Yeah. I think that's about all I got. I don't know. I heard, I, okay. So this happened.
1460560	1469040	So I have a trainer and I go to the gym regularly, but I'm going out of town. Thank you.
1470240	1475600	A couple of trainers for self-care. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going out of town.
1475600	1482160	I'm going, excuse me a second, going out of town next month. So, uh,
1482160	1492960	uh, so, uh, I canceled my trainer, my trainer. So like, but they, but I've been going there for
1492960	1499680	like about four years and they said, well, you've accrued through like your trainer canceling or
1499680	1507840	you canceling or whatever. You've accrued like, like 30 extra days in there that you paid for,
1507840	1514880	you know, and if you cancel it, if you cancel it, they're just going to disappear. And I was like,
1514880	1522640	well, how many, how many, uh, when, when is my, if I cancel it today, when does it up? Well, it's
1522640	1529440	up like in two weeks. So I said, well, I'll just do them in, in two weeks. So I've been going to
1529440	1538880	the fucking gym every single day for like two hours, thinking that I'm going to get fucking
1538880	1546080	Statham for Kate when she comes back from her vacation. Gotta get Statham. Yeah. But I fucked
1546080	1556640	up my back and I can't like bend over to pick up my socks. So I'm the opposite of Statham. I'm a
1556640	1563600	50 year old ex comic book artist who can't pick up his socks here. Have you seen Statham's latest
1563600	1572640	movie? It sounds like you have no, but I'll check it out on Reddit. He's got his own shop. Uh,
1573520	1578720	Chinese, Chinese gangsters come in and kill everybody inside. I need these comic books
1578720	1589200	picked up and socks. Oh, I'm the man for the job. Are you 50? Yeah. Yeah, Governor. What they
1589200	1596880	didn't know. Hey, you didn't pick up one sock. That's because there was a baby in it. That's
1596880	1603120	Chinese baby. We take it to comic book store. I'm afraid I'm going to have to break my only rule.
1603120	1614480	Jason Statham is the 50 year old ex comic book artist who I actually, I already, I
1614480	1619200	conflated your job with the stuff you're picking up off the floor. Yeah. No, no. I added comic
1619200	1626560	books all over the floor. Yeah. My, my back is all fucked up. It's like really like it's, it's
1626560	1633520	fucked up. And I've got like one more session tomorrow. And I'm like, I don't know if I can
1633520	1639440	do it. I'm so close to the finish line, but I don't know why I'm doing this. I'm hurting myself
1640320	1643680	because I'm too much. I'd be like, the guy's going to go, you know what? Because what they
1643680	1648160	were trying to do, this is why I'm doing it. They were trying to do, well, if you pay for another
1648160	1652960	month, you'll be able to have more time to get rid of those. I'm like, I'm not going to give you
1652960	1660480	more money so I can use the stuff I already paid for. What planet are you from? And the, and
1660480	1666240	planet drug dealer, planet drug dealer. He said, all right, but, all right. But you did, it's not
1666240	1672320	a zero sum game. You rat, you rung a certain quantity out of a rag and you're, you're okay.
1672320	1678960	So one drip is this is my therapist said, here's your expectation. Here's what you got. That's how
1678960	1690240	much you grieve. So like, oh, I thought there was going to be toothpaste this morning. Oh,
1690240	1698080	there's no toothpaste. You got to squeeze the fucking crust out of a weird, like random toothpaste
1698080	1704960	thing that you've found in the, but where you keep the plunger. Well, I wish that wasn't the case.
1705520	1709440	I don't let that, you know, it's like one little, it's like, they go,
1710800	1714160	here's what I wanted. Here's what I got. Here's how much I grieve.
1718320	1723120	Sorry, I got, I got, I got high. It's better than like the, it's, it's better than me.
1723120	1728480	It's better than me. Just, I'm very frazzled right now. I've been, I've been on a dive. I'm in that.
1728480	1733120	I'm, I'm, I'm letting people down on a deadline. I'm like, I'm, I'm in my pajamas in bed and I'm
1733360	1737760	failing to write. You know, we were talking to Adam Conover about the blowback effect. I,
1737760	1741600	I, the thing that was most striking to me about it in his show is what they mentioned is that
1741600	1751520	the human brain receives not knowing something as pain, which means guys like us, Rob, creatives,
1752240	1762800	we're like boxers. We're just as macho, like, like firefighters. But if every call was,
1762880	1767920	there were no kitten calls. I haven't gotten a kitten call.
1770400	1775760	By the way, why is that heroic getting a kitten out of a tree? Fucking easiest gig in the world.
1776960	1781920	It's a kitten. It's scared to be in the tree. Oh, got a ladder. Now you're a hero. Come on.
1782960	1785120	You thought it was you two. He was talking about. Yeah.
1785120	1793040	Wait, what? My, every time, every time I bend over to pick up a sock,
1793680	1802880	all right, you get my ass hurts. My ass is like a sciatic. Yes. Yes, exactly. My psych. Yeah.
1802880	1806400	And it hurts. You got to keep, you got to keep stretching, man. Do you want to go to my guy?
1807920	1812720	What? Okay. My guy, my car for your ass. You want to go to his guy for your ass.
1812720	1820000	Yes. Simple. What? My guy did help me, but. With your sciatic? Yeah. I don't have back pain
1820000	1824720	anymore. In fact, I stopped going to him because one of the things he said was like, you need,
1824720	1829360	you need better core strength. So now I'm like doing. So you stopped going. He said,
1829360	1835440	like, I didn't give it a long time. He goes, you need more core strength. Okay. Can we cancel
1835440	1841760	next week? So I don't need you. Yeah. I mean, in a sense. Problem solved. I don't need. He's
1841760	1846320	saying like, he's like the reason you're going to continue to have a bad back at your age,
1846320	1851520	because you're not, you don't have a strong core. So you get the belly in the front and you got the
1851520	1856720	back in the back. You got the party in the back. And uh, and so like, you should, like, you should
1856720	1861440	be, you don't have any core, you know? What? Like, well, yeah, you're, I mean. But that's what I've
1861440	1868160	been doing. I've been doing core. I've been doing my shoulders. I've been doing my legs. I've been
1868160	1879600	doing, uh, my back. I've been doing my. Yeah. I'm not saying, I'm not saying I'm not sending you to
1879600	1888320	a coreologist. I'm sending you a chiropractor. And just for some reason on my left ass, every
1888400	1900960	time I bend over to or get out of a car or walk the dog, I'm in terrible pain. Like my left ass
1900960	1908160	isn't a lot of pain. Like I'm almost, I'm like, I think I'm going to fucking die sometimes.
1908160	1916720	Like I'm like, like getting out of the car when I was he just to go to the show. I thought I was,
1916720	1921760	I thought I was going to cry. I was crying. It's like an electrical jolt sometimes, right?
1921760	1928080	Like from your ass down into your shoe. Yes. And so like a fucking genius I did this morning,
1928080	1934640	I go, Oh, well, what I need is Ben Gay, which we've talked about before I get out of the bathtub
1934640	1941920	and I put Ben Gay on my left ass and it mixes with the water that's already on my ass and it
1942000	1958560	drips down my ass crack. Now my ass is on fire. Did you see that? Like I was going to do this and
1958560	1966800	I went, Oh, there's a pylon and I went, I can't, I'm not going to look at the guy that's making the
1966800	1974800	tiger sound. I can't, I'm not going to look at him. I'm afraid that I can't like water. Tiger man.
1976480	1979840	I only listen past episode 400 because that's when tiger man gets involved.
1982480	1985600	Remember when that blind guy came and he was great. And then we were like, you're going to
1985600	1992240	come again. And he was like, fuck you. I was like, no, I'm using you. I'm blind. I don't remember
1992240	1996560	this. Well, yeah, it's just one show. Like he was like, he came up and he killed the audience,
1996560	2001200	loved him. And it was like, Oh man, what a great thing to have this like fun, like,
2003680	2010480	this like sharp, like, uh, uh, uh, out of nowhere blind guy that starts like coming up on, on the
2010480	2015040	show. And that's like, I'm sure he's like, yeah, I'm sure everyone feels that way. I'm fucking
2015040	2020080	blind and dealing with it. I'm not your fucking, uh, candle to put on your coffee table.
2020560	2028720	I really missed that guy. Anybody remember that episode? I think it was that, was that meltdown?
2028720	2037120	I feel like it was still meltdown. Uh, we'll have to look up what episode that is.
2038480	2041760	I think it's, I think it's, I think it's another, I think there's a reference to,
2041760	2046720	to him in the title, like somewhat like, but anyways, uh, okay. Uh, new favorite show
2046720	2051360	almost through it. Cause there's only two seasons. Uh, love after lockup.
2056320	2067600	I'm telling you, man, love after lockup. Tiger man wants to say what, uh, love after lockup.
2068160	2074720	Uh, discourage him. I don't know why bringing attention to him didn't discourage him.
2074720	2085360	It's about, it's about people and they, it's about people who, uh, mostly, uh, who, uh, meet
2085360	2094880	and then, uh, who meet their mates, uh, through like meet an inmate.com and sites like that where
2094880	2100560	there's this. Yeah. Well, that's the first thing that like, it was like a mind blower, but I mean,
2100560	2106160	I'm telling you it's a real, it's like, yeah, there's a lot of like VH1 style kind of editing
2106160	2111680	to it where you'll, you should play Minecraft or like watch it with a partner because like,
2111680	2118480	like there's a lot of opportunity to just talk and because, because every time someone says,
2118480	2125040	well, uh, Damon, uh, I'm starting to have doubts about whether he's, uh, playing it this way
2125040	2128000	because of what happened at the airport. And you know, as soon as they reference anything,
2128000	2131360	it's going to immediately cut to a scene. You already saw at the airport real quick, but
2132560	2138960	if you can get over that, which I, I, if you can, it's crazy. These stories, like
2140080	2147120	get through the first season. The second season is like three times crazier. I've never example.
2147120	2153680	Jamarias didn't tell me that he had another family before he was locked up. And now we all live
2153680	2162320	together. Well, there is, there is, there is, what's his name? Jamarias. There is, there is one girl
2162320	2172240	who doesn't know. There's a lot of, uh, there's going to be a lot of like, did he wrestle Cerberus?
2174000	2179360	When Christina first looked me up on prison day.com, you know, she, she told me she was okay with my
2179360	2184160	situation, but, uh, she not okay with my situation. Well, here's what's crazy.
2188400	2196320	They, they did, it's, it's, it's, it's all across the gender and racial spectrum. Uh, like, uh,
2196320	2201040	you got, you gotta stop, man. You gotta stop. Like, it's going to go Adam Goldberg so fast.
2202800	2208000	Um, the, the, it, it, that's, that's another, that's something first. I didn't know I had
2208000	2211520	preconceptions about this stuff, but when I heard about like, Oh, love after lockup, I just
2211520	2218720	immediately, first of all pictured like the, the kind of like that, the women that write to the
2218720	2224000	inmates. And then the it's like, Oh, what's going on with them? And you got these preconceived
2224000	2231280	notions. I hear like, okay, no, there's just as many guys doing it with like these female inmates.
2231280	2237520	And here's the crazy thing is, is what's was, is the similarities. The crazy thing is the stuff that
2237520	2244240	crosses all lines of, of, of, of gender and race, I guess are the two lines. I don't know, say class,
2244240	2249600	like the monopoly guys getting out of prison. There's no episode like that. Um, but, but I was
2249600	2256800	kind of like blown away at an almost uplifting humanistic way to, to like, Oh my God, like
2258080	2264960	stories, this extreme, like genders and artificial construct, because what's really defining these
2264960	2271120	people on is, is whether you're out of prison or in prison. That's the two genders in these
2271120	2277760	relationships and the people who are out of prison. Um, I, I, I hope, I hope there's not an
2277760	2282480	exception to this because they would definitely not deserve to be lumped in this way. And I,
2282480	2288800	I don't want to judge anybody ever for the rest of my life, but I'm like fascinated by
2288800	2291600	the fact that like, it seems like all of the people that are out of prison
2292320	2302800	that are going to these prison sites to find a mate, um, it's like, they all are going there
2302800	2310160	because in every sense of the phrase on both levels of the phrase, they like the idea of having
2310160	2317440	a prisoner for a mate. So that includes after they get out, like, like these, in whatever way
2317440	2321600	that you're capable of expressing it, like these people are like, Oh, this is their recourse to
2321600	2329600	control. Like they want to be, um, a warden in a relationship. Now that sometimes that takes the
2329600	2335200	form of like toxic masculine. Like there's like crazy, crazy, the characters on this show.
2336720	2342880	You're going to learn their names and be like, there's no boring ones. It's like, it's, and I
2342880	2348400	actually was like, I feel like I'm, I'm learning about relationships because it's so extreme. It's
2348400	2354400	so dysfunctional out of the gate that it's sort of like, that's not good learning. No,
2355040	2361280	no, it is. Don't use this guide, man. Don't use this as a guide, man. No, it is. There's a, there's,
2361280	2363920	there's, there's, I'm sure there's a, there's a metaphor that would suffice about it though,
2363920	2370000	because it's like, you're talking about, it's a view, you going down to the shore and watching
2370000	2377680	where ocean pounds into a rock so that you can build better pneumatic pipes and things. So like,
2377680	2384320	like, like where you're like, I want to understand the dangerous forces that are at play when two
2384320	2390000	people that don't want to be alone, um, uh, got their hooks in each other in various ways. And
2390000	2396240	it's like, if you, because, because in, in, in more healthy relationships, then, Oh, I, I went to a
2396240	2401120	prison site and, and, and started writing this person in relationships with more healthy starts
2401120	2408800	to that you, you, the undercurrent of, uh, of materialism, this idea of like, well, this person
2408800	2414880	just needs to eat. They just got out of the joint. Like they're trapped in this relationship or
2414880	2423040	they're taking advantage of, of, of someone usually exactly both in this crazy, um, like
2423040	2429760	ant ants mating, like colliding in the air and tumbling as they fuck to the earth,
2429760	2436800	or like both needs being filled, both killing each other. Uh, it's like, I need control over
2436800	2443520	a human being. I have a, you know, and the other person is like, I need a sandwich. And, and it's
2443600	2453360	just like, um, it, it, it is, it is truly intense, man. I, I can't recommend it enough. There's a,
2453360	2458480	there's a, I, I, I, I, there's a million reality shows. I'll recommend one more just to show that
2458480	2464000	it's not like, Oh, Dan, you watch a reality show and you're like not desensitized to them. So your
2464000	2469840	old man thinks reality shows are interesting. No, I don't. I, but I, but it's this kind of real
2469840	2474960	quick. It's this kind of a point that you had when he asked last week about, uh, is it real life and,
2474960	2479360	and real life, does it adapt to script? And I think there's something interesting about what
2479360	2483520	you point out as the very rawness of the lack of storyline. These are just real characters that are
2483520	2486960	super dynamic. Yeah. And, but you, and you're also like pulling these characters out of it.
2486960	2492400	Cause it's like, it goes through these shades of like, like you can eat, you can so easily go,
2492400	2498480	Oh, he's the Mark. He's the trick. You know, she's a, she's a sociopath. Like it's the same way that
2499040	2503520	on any sidewalk or shopping mall where you might, you people watching and you,
2504800	2509920	it's not like we, it's not like the human mind, uh, has a question mark in place of an opinion
2509920	2514960	about a stranger, you know, like until they get more data. It's like, we know exactly who's racist.
2516720	2522320	You'll find out later if you're right. Um, but, uh, it, it like, like, so you watch these stories
2522320	2527840	and it's like, you go like, Oh, Oh, Oh, I feel bad for him. Because like the guy, the way he's
2527840	2531760	talking about it, it's like, well, I've known Sasha for nine months. I mean, I've never talked,
2531760	2535440	I've never seen her in person, but I've been sending her money and, and, and all that stuff.
2535440	2540160	And you're like, okay, my pity is going over there. And then she, I'm making one up. I don't
2540160	2543920	want to spoil it really. Any other real ones, but it's like, and then, and then, and then she gets
2543920	2550000	out and you're like this poor guy. And it's just like, it's not even just like it flips to,
2550000	2555440	Oh, this guy's a monster. It's like while it's flipping to it's he's, he's a monster.
2556240	2562480	It's also, you're, you're kind of like, you're learning more about why she might be well,
2562480	2566800	why was she in prison and like, like, like, and, and what is she supposed to fucking do?
2566800	2572640	And, and again, like it's, it's, it's, well, it's, it makes no difference if it's a dude,
2572640	2578160	like the dudes are like fucking, you know, they, they could snap the woman's neck,
2578160	2583040	but it changes nothing about the dynamic on that fundamental level that there's one person who's
2583040	2588160	like, I just got out of prison. I really want to sit in a lawn chair in my backyard and drink
2588160	2596560	a beer and stare at the sun. And, and the other person is like, I have decided a year ago that
2596560	2602480	I am in love with this person and I need them to get a job. And, and, and it's just like, wow,
2602480	2609280	away we go. Rock them, sock them robots. Yeah. Like, like, and, and, and, and it really, I think
2609280	2615760	the only grim thing about it is, is that after a while you kind of like start to realize that,
2615760	2624480	oh, you know, yeah, nobody's getting out of prison with autonomy. Like, it's just sort of like,
2624480	2629280	that starts to feel like, like, like the bowl at a bull fight coming out and they're like,
2629840	2635520	what's that dart in his back? Well, that's like the right blend of chemicals that they use to
2635520	2641920	handicap this animal's natural strengths over the humans that have the swords. So like, it's,
2641920	2647120	it's like, well, everyone's coming out of prison completely addicted to being told what to do and
2647120	2651520	also having some kind of oppositional defiant, like impulse in them. They're probably addicted
2651520	2656640	to some chemical that they were either being supplied in prison and, or certainly did not
2656640	2662000	get like adequate treatment for their addiction too. And, and a slew of other crazy, like,
2662880	2667840	personality dysfunctions that it's just really fun to watch. I mean, I would, I would, I would,
2667840	2671040	I would stop talking about it, but I don't, you know, there's no, you got number two.
2671840	2676800	What's recommendation number two? Oh, it's, it's, it's, it's not as exciting. I just thought it was
2676800	2681040	a really good, well produced reality show. It's about like the, remember, I think I might have
2681040	2688080	mentioned it before. That, that, that it's the real life version of the movie Nightcrawler.
2688080	2691680	Like, this is the guys that I can't remember the name of the show now. It's the, it's the guys
2691680	2696720	that go around LA and they shoot like news footage at like three in the morning, like car
2696720	2703360	accidents and like chases and whatever news. And there's like three, three companies that are in
2703360	2707840	competition with each other and they all have histories with each other. And that was a really,
2707840	2714960	really fun show to watch. Are those, are those guys the same as paparazzi in that? I know it's
2714960	2720320	paparazzi, but I say paparazzi. Are they the same? Do they have the same background? Are they like
2721200	2726640	LA locals or are they transplants from like Eastern Europe? Well, it's the, the, the show opens with
2726640	2730160	and is produced by, and you're kind of like, oh, these are the, these are the guys that are my
2730160	2735120	favorite. And they also, it's there. It's the show that they made, but, but it's, it's like
2736160	2742400	British brothers and the first guy is just like, he, he, he's an adrenaline junkie. Like he,
2743360	2751760	he, he, as far as he is concerned, chasing police and ambulances or, or, or, or, or just trying to
2751760	2757280	use the freeway system to get to an intersection point where you're going to get the perfect, like
2757280	2762320	that adrenaline is his idea of a perfect job. And then the only dilemma is how am I going to get
2762320	2767840	paid to do this? Like in a way that's going to also feed my family and like, while other people
2767920	2775040	are like doing it differently in a way that's going to box the Mon Pop corpse filming out of
2775040	2781600	the market. It's a real crime. What happened to the small business? It's sort of like a cheaters.
2782160	2788480	There's two, two hosts, but one of them is clearly like into it. Cheaters? Yeah. Oh, that show where
2788480	2793280	they go catch the people cheating. Yeah. There's two hosts. Cause the first guy got stabbed.
2794240	2797360	Didn't I always thought they were, I thought they were, am I wrong about this?
2797360	2801760	Aren't there two dude? Yeah, there's two. Thank you. Only one dude out here watching cheaters.
2803520	2808000	Um, one of them is like, okay, let's go. And the other one's like, why were you here? Don
2808000	2814160	trail? Like he's just really takes it personal. Maybe, maybe, maybe one of them is a cheater.
2814160	2820080	Yeah. So they're like, well, I'm, I'm, I'm good at hosting the show cause I have cheated.
2820080	2826240	I'm not going to lie. My heart's not in it. I kind of wish the guy would get away.
2829120	2832560	Just want to, just want to feel a little vicarious calm about cheating,
2833840	2837840	but I do know where they're going to be. And like, like that's part of their job.
2837840	2842480	If you guys see the commercial for the show about the, like the task force that handles
2842480	2847840	child abduction and the, uh, the gimmick is that there's a new member of the team.
2847840	2853040	She was a child abductee and they don't, but, and I, and I was like, that's a little,
2853760	2857520	that's a little silly. And Cody's like, well, no, it's not. She would be, they do that on SVU.
2857520	2861360	Like you, the, you can relate to the victims, the cops. No, I'm like, yeah, as a victim,
2861360	2866960	like if you had a trauma, like that that's, but, but they play it in the commercial. Like she,
2866960	2872320	like, like it's like her superpower. Like she's like, I was abducted once. Check that shed.
2872320	2883120	They love sheds. You only knew one of them. You're not a ghost buster. You're not men in black.
2890080	2894160	There was a shadow. What have you been doing since you've had a house to yourself?
2894800	2901680	Um, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2901680	2903600	I've been, I've been watching a lot of TV.
2907360	2910080	Do you masturbate past the point where like nothing comes out?
2911600	2912720	Just a little bang sign.
2914160	2916240	Not for a while. Not for a while.
2917040	2920960	Cody went away for a week and I like she's gone. No, she was. She's back now.
2921600	2923040	Kate's gone until Saturday.
2925120	2929520	It's fucked up when, uh, when they leave because you really do, uh, you really do beat the little
2929520	2934080	man up and then they come back and they look at it and they're like, what the fuck did you do
2935280	2944480	while I was gone? And you're like, Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's just, it's just not, uh,
2944480	2947520	uh, he's got a suit on.
2951600	2955360	It's very good with Cody. Like I find, like I never had a really, like, like, like, well,
2957120	2963120	like, I just, like, uh, now when I, uh, it's just like, it's like, uh, it's like a, it's like a
2963120	2970480	halfsy thing now. Like, uh, like I'm like, Oh, he can't simulate the anymore. Like a relationship
2970480	2975840	where it's like, kind of, it's, uh, it's, uh, what is this? It's not humble bragging. I'm just
2975840	2981840	bragging. I, I, but, but I, I never experienced it before where it was like, like where you're like,
2981840	2986400	like, okay, well there's like a habit in my head where I'm like, Ooh, time to jerk off.
2986400	2991920	Like cart cart blanche, but like I can jerk off whenever I want in a healthy relationship. And
2991920	3002560	then on top of that, like also the real thing is, is kind of open and deep and deep, um, and loose.
3002560	3012000	And there's an echo and, um, the, the, the, the real, the real thing is, is, is it's voluminous.
3012000	3016000	And then, and then, and then the, and then it's like, now it's a kind of like this childish thing
3016000	3022480	where I'm like, it's like a compulsion and then like, and it just feels like a little craft
3022480	3035120	project. Like, uh, it's just like a, but it won't stop me from doing it again. And I was wondering if
3035120	3043280	you craft project, you don't have to picture the glue. Like what is that glitter glitter glue. Yeah.
3043760	3050320	Yeah. It's the greatest thing you'll ever hear in your life.
3051920	3060560	Now, can we pretend we have a guest so I can, I can sit down. Sure. All right. Wow. The stage is
3060560	3069120	empty tonight. Three lonely microphones sitting alone. Why don't you interview the microphones?
3069760	3073680	Pretend their guests. Yeah. Let's get a little feedback. Microphone number one.
3075280	3081840	How's your evening? That was for all the dads for all the dads.
3084240	3095360	Not proud of it. Had to do it. We've got our, uh, uh, British, uh, ladies of true crime
3096080	3100880	coming, uh, what's it March 10th? Is that going to be, let be next week? These are the hand people,
3101520	3106400	the red handed, red handed podcast. I say this just in case, you know, you know, there's an
3106400	3111360	episode coming up where I'm going to be interviewing people and they have a, they have a podcast. So
3112800	3118400	if you want to get out in front of it, you'll have familiarity. We don't, we have a clip
3118400	3123520	from that episode that we could show tonight to get people to interested. Why don't we just check
3123520	3129280	out the clip? Check out the clip there. Turn, just turn around and look. You fucking idiot. There's
3129280	3138400	no clip. How would we have a clip? It's in the future. Do you stand up the whole time?
3139280	3144480	It depends. Why don't you be the guest? Take a, take a load off.
3144480	3149680	Anybody want to hear about me?
3150880	3155120	No, not true. We can, um, I'm not that good an interviewer. We're not going to learn that much
3155120	3162320	about you. I, uh, I, we can always pull somebody up too. Uh, no, don't, oh, I wish I could go back
3162320	3171440	in time and stop. Just let me, let me, let me, let me, oh, let me, let me come around to that idea.
3171920	3176000	Um, I just want to have a sense of control and comfort in my life.
3177920	3184880	I just want a permission to like myself again. I, uh, I just want to get over my approval addiction,
3184880	3193840	my narcissism, uh, my, uh, fluctuating weight. Um, I would like, uh, I would, I need a new pair of
3193840	3206000	shoes. I, um, I, my, uh, here's something relatable. I, uh, uh, like at least two of my
3206000	3214720	six surveillance cameras are hardly weatherproof. I like, uh, hello. When it's raining is when I
3214720	3224800	want to see if there's someone outside. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm foggy at, uh, when it's raining. Oh,
3224800	3232240	great. Great. Cause when does anyone ever had a creepy person outside their house in the rain?
3232240	3236880	You, you got to get on those neighborhood things on, on my face. Oh, you, those, uh,
3236880	3241120	the next door app I signed, I got my next door. Next door is too much. They want too much info.
3241120	3244000	They'll, they'll give out like your fucking location. I know. It feels like it's just
3244000	3249440	such a weird thing. I'm like, I, my, my name is, uh, Knight Rider on there. Cause I'm like, well,
3249440	3256560	it just seemed, but it's like, well, my, cause like, cause like Cody used like a code name and I'm
3256560	3260880	like, but other people are clearly not using a code name. And then I'm like, like, cause, cause,
3260880	3265360	cause I gave my first piece of advice cause somebody lost their cat and I was like,
3265360	3270080	Hey, I think I saw your cat in my backyard and they had identified it as an outdoor cat. And I
3270080	3275360	was like, you, I really don't want to be this, this guy. And I wouldn't say this if, if I had
3275360	3281280	seen anyone else say it cause I, you, you're none of my beeswax, but got major coyote shit going on
3281280	3288000	up here. And, uh, and I, I had to say where I was. I'm like, Oh, I'm right up here. And I'm like,
3288000	3293680	well, so what is it? Yeah. I guess I'm agreeing with you. I'm like, how can you have like a next
3293680	3298640	door app kind of thing without everybody just having your address? And then it's, it's not like
3298640	3305360	there's a Facebook. It's on the old Facebook. Every neighborhood has a group, right? And you
3305360	3309680	can get on, you don't have to, you don't have to like do anything other than just look at that page
3309680	3314720	because it'll tell you what's going on immediately. Like somebody will be like, I heard gunshots. And
3314720	3318000	then four or five people will be like, I heard gunshots in this. Okay. And you can, you don't
3318000	3324720	have to use, you know, you don't have to give up your actual like info. I had a friend. I don't
3324720	3328640	know. I, I, I don't know if they want credit for this insight or not. So I'm going to give them
3328640	3334000	their anonymity. But I have a friend who we were talking about the next door app and they said,
3335280	3341600	it's, uh, it's just a, uh, I don't know how they phrased it, but they basically implied like,
3341600	3349360	it's just making people more racist. It's just a bunch of people saying there's a, a, a brown skin
3349360	3355840	girl casing my house. And people are like, like, like now just using the word casing to refer to
3355840	3360640	pedestrians in their neighborhood. Like everyone wants to be the first person to notice someone
3360640	3366480	casing their house. That's why Facebook's great because there's, um, there's a lot of different
3366480	3372400	ethnicities watching people post. So if somebody's like, took a picture of this dude, I think he
3372480	3379280	stole my break. But, but, but, but 50 people, I need to try to understand this thing though,
3379280	3386640	because to the extent that it's accountable to the planet, how is it, I guess the idea is
3387600	3392480	if you, if you, if you seal it off, then that's like the psychological equivalent of a gated
3392480	3396480	community. It kind of promotes this sort of white flight, maybe mentality where it's like,
3397280	3402960	our neighborhood is precious. And as opposed to our neighborhood is something that only
3402960	3408400	we care about and it keeps it positive. It's a permeable membrane. It's like greenhouse gas,
3408400	3414080	like, uh, you need to get that shit out. You can't trap it in. You can't have them in the greenhouse
3414080	3420240	for sure. Because if you're, if you're, if you're comporting yourself, when you talk to your
3420240	3425840	neighbors about your neighborhood in a way that only that is suitable for the planet to comment on,
3426480	3432480	that's a good exercise. Yeah. It keeps us all neighborly. If you know that you have to speak
3432480	3436560	about the neighborhood in a way that your neighbors won't get pissed about. Here's the thing that I,
3436560	3442640	I, I already hate other guys. I knew I was going to see it. I just, it's the, the, the, the, the
3442640	3447120	architecture snobbery, like, like the, the way people force it in, it's like a running gag.
3447120	3453840	Like someone will go lost cat. Um, I lost my cat. Its name is vanilla. It answers to anything
3453840	3458160	cause it's a fucking cat. It doesn't, it's never answered anything in its life. Its brain
3458160	3464240	is a cluster of nerves in its head and it's, uh, it owns us. Um, but, uh, I'm a, I love cats,
3464240	3469280	but the, the, the, the, the, sorry, derailed myself, but like, like, oh, I haven't seen my cat.
3469280	3473440	And then like, it'll be a couple of comments. Like, Oh, I think I had a cat like that once or
3473440	3479920	someone will go, I think I saw that cat. And then like third one will be, uh, well, maybe it, uh,
3480320	3486640	uh, broke its own neck while turning it away from the eyesore and the corner of
3489680	3494480	and then everyone's like, yo, that fucking piece of shit. Like who builds out right out to the
3494480	3498880	property line? I hate modern architecture. Yeah. What is the bit of that? I'm like, what are you
3498880	3504240	fucking like? I don't know. Like you will lose hours looking at that shit. Cause on Facebook,
3504240	3508400	they're mad that the whole foods 360 is now just going to be a regular whole foods.
3510240	3514960	A huge, I guess, I guess some of that stuff I find important, but I draw the line.
3514960	3518080	I don't know why I draw the line. I know why I draw the line because it's something I don't,
3518800	3525920	I don't know about. And I don't, but I just feel like, well, goddamn dude, we, we, we, we sell each
3525920	3532960	other, uh, lots of land, uh, like in these parcels, you don't even, you're not even allowed to dig
3533040	3539440	down and like just AT&T owns everything five feet underneath your fire hydrant and mobile
3540320	3545520	licensing any aluminum you might find from, you're not, you don't even really own the fucking land
3545520	3552080	anymore. If you want to build a tree house and the, if they want to, they can come kick it down and
3552880	3559440	write Jew on your forehead. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but it just feels like those are the times we're
3559440	3568320	living in. And the, uh, if you, if you, I just, I just can't stand that idea that on top of that
3568320	3575760	then your neighbors are like judging you based on like, Oh, like, Oh, his, his front door is like
3575760	3583040	right next to the sidewalk. Well, if that's what they want, I, I will tell you that LA is, who cares.
3583040	3586240	I mean, I think they care because they, they have a general, I understand that they're
3586240	3591120	like maybe more classically educated. I don't think there's something wrong with me because I
3591120	3596160	just don't care. I definitely would never notice the fucking eyesore and I would be like,
3597280	3603040	how does that affect me? I, why, why spend time thinking about it? The only thing that I'll think
3603040	3608640	is that I'll go like, well, maybe for those people, maybe when they look out their front door, when
3608640	3615120	they walk their dog, maybe they're having that, maybe they have the same uncontrollable reaction
3615120	3620560	to looking down their sidewalk that I have maybe at looking at your punctuation or something.
3620560	3624800	I'm not a grammar master, but like, if you use the wrong form of your or something, like,
3624800	3629520	like maybe, maybe some people just couldn't give a piss about that and they won't get hung up about
3629520	3637440	it. And, and, uh, and, and maybe it like, maybe if it's, if, if, if, if I could understand that
3637440	3642480	everyone was just being the way that they really are. Yeah. But you're, you're a writer and you're
3642480	3650720	a word person, like your, your, your, your life is words. These people are just looking at a house
3650720	3656560	and they're not architects, they're not door builders, they're not like line drawers.
3656560	3663040	But my vocation isn't the reason why I, I, that's, I, that's a byproduct of the fact that I,
3663760	3671280	I care about the aesthetics of, of, of letters on, on a screen, you know, like it's, I'm, I'm not,
3671360	3676320	I'm saying it's, it's a kind of an LA thing to shit talk, uh, architecture.
3676320	3682240	I just, I guess it makes me feel insecure. Cause I, I, I feel like a, I feel like a lower class
3682240	3685760	person that like made good and moved to LA. And I was just, I have this, like, I just,
3685760	3690880	I've never felt like, like I understand you can't buy class, you know? And then like,
3690880	3696240	I just have this panic when people are like, you know, Oh, what are, what are these people
3696240	3701600	Armenian? What do they have columns in their thing? And it's like, well, because they, because
3701600	3706000	they fucking, because they worked their whole life to fucking have a house. What the,
3706000	3710480	like, columns house to look like yours. You want it. Everyone wants to be the first act of
3710480	3714720	Beetlejuice. Like that's going to make you high. I just, I mean, we, uh, we, uh, we always give
3714720	3720240	this place a hard, it's a weird thing. I think people in LA tend to shit talk it. You get to
3720240	3724400	this period where you don't shit talk it. And then I think you shit talk it again. After like,
3724400	3727760	after your first year here, you're like, fuck this place. There's no jazz and no tall buildings
3727760	3732800	and there's no downtown. And then you love it. There's no jazz and tall buildings. Right. And
3732800	3737120	then you, where should I live? Where should I live? And then five years later you're like,
3737120	3741200	fucking traffic and I can't pay my rent. And then 10 years later you're like into the groove and
3741200	3744400	you're not complaining about that shit, but you're complaining. You're like, look at this fucking
3744400	3750960	French gate on this Spanish house with this Japanese roof, right? Astro turf on the porch.
3750960	3755760	I paid too much rent to have to live across the street from that hodgepodge house. It's like
3755760	3761280	settling in. It's like, it's like, like the Steve Martin observation about how it's beautiful that
3761280	3767120	everyone that comes out here can be in their own world. Yeah. That actually is still a valid
3767120	3773440	observation. I think you're stuck in everybody's heaven, but like there may be, I'm going to sound
3773440	3780480	like a really jaded, nasty person, but I'll just, if I choose my words right, everyone's going to
3780480	3787840	like me, right? It almost, it seems like what you're describing is like, you settle into kind
3787840	3793920	of a, well, I guess I live in LA now in spite of the fact that I really don't want to anymore.
3794560	3797840	Or you're like, you're pat, you're, you're kind of like, well, I guess this is where I live now.
3798640	3803680	Like, it's not because I'm like, I got an audition on Thursday that might like mean
3804320	3811760	my, like, like LA is like very much thrives on this anticipation energy, but there's certainly
3811760	3817200	not enough anticipation to go around for the, however many millions of people live in LA.
3817200	3817680	No.
3817680	3822960	So many people do have to provide us with the foundation of a society, which is for them to
3822960	3828480	settle in and go like, well, this neighborhood hasn't been the same since they opened that booby
3828480	3833920	boob. Uh, you know, but most people are like, I don't give a fuck. Throw a stickers bar out the
3833920	3840320	window. I'm about to be Spielberg. Right. It makes you feel, that's why I've just said, uh, I always
3840320	3844800	send a special shout out to people from Los Angeles. Cause I'm like, you guys have to put
3844800	3848640	up with so many people coming here and fucking this place up. It's amazing that they hang on
3848640	3853040	to any authenticity. And I think one of the ways that they do that is by complaining about the
3853040	3858080	shit that we build. Cause we missed Wisconsin or we missed Kansas. So we're like, man, I got to
3858080	3862080	build a fucking house out of wood instead of building what they actually build without it here.
3862080	3866160	So you see these neighborhoods that are like ding, dong, ding, all sorts of different shit.
3866160	3870400	And I think that's, that's how we live. We live by complaining about the place, but loving it.
3871280	3875600	Yeah. Well, I wish the, I wish they could put a, I wish they could remember the love a little bit.
3876640	3883760	I think Los Angelenos love it. What love, love hating, uh, uh, gaudy houses. Yeah. Well,
3883760	3888320	I just, I just want them to smile then. Like when you love something, like, I, like, they're,
3888320	3892640	I think the locals, you know, the locals love it. They're from here. They don't leave. They don't
3892640	3897600	kick us out. They don't make it too hard to transplant here. I think it's like I said,
3897600	3902960	you know, I think it's us. We get here and we're like, Oh, give me my shit. And then LA is like,
3904640	3910480	and if you're lucky you live here long enough to complain about the pagoda that just got built.
3910480	3919680	I mean, I, I mean, I guess, but then, okay, I'll, I'll, I'll join in. I'll, I'll, I'll process
3919680	3924560	myself. I'll, I'll go. Okay. But Dan, are you telling me that there's nothing that your next
3924560	3932000	door neighbor can do to make you want to raise a complaint with some counsel or something? Well,
3932000	3937600	I think probably not ever, never. I mean, I can't imagine that, but, but, but I will, I mean,
3937600	3942880	a thing that would, would, would make me wish that they would do something different. I guess
3942880	3949360	it would just be about the kind of empirical demonstrations of squalor. They're like, like,
3949360	3954240	like, like, so while I, while here I am sitting here saying to people who have an opinion about
3954240	3960400	a gray slab of concrete, like, right, that you have to steer around when you drive
3961280	3964880	past their house because they wanted to make the most out of every square inch of the
3964880	3969760	property they, they, they're built on. And I'm saying to those people that have a complaint
3969760	3975520	about that, hey, relax, but well, okay, it's worth noting that if you had an engine block on the,
3975520	3981360	on your front lawn, well, I probably would never come to say anything about it except to Cody. I
3981360	3986240	would, I, I would, every time I saw it, I'd be like, well, you make it look like we're unhappy.
3987200	3992000	You know, so I have, I have aesthetic opinions. They're just lower class ones. Band practice.
3992960	3996240	Those are the two words that would get you to speak to your neighbor.
3996240	4002080	Oh, I mean, I, I don't know. I mean, I've sat in my bed and there's been, like,
4002080	4008880	people playing music so loud that I got neighbors texting me. Yeah. Or like, is that you? No,
4008880	4014560	it's not. I think that's so and so. I don't know who it is. It's loud over here too. I, I,
4015440	4020560	Cody, while I wasn't there once, went over and talked to some people. I think there's an Airbnb
4020560	4028000	near my place where Rob Cordry stayed there. Snitch. Uh, no, he, he, he snitched. Snitch.
4029920	4035680	Snitch. He was doing work at his house and he, he saw my wifi at the Airbnb he was taking out.
4035680	4043040	Remember? How do you know? How did he know it was yours? He says Harmon wifi. God damn it.
4043040	4049280	And I still haven't changed it. I still haven't changed it. You gotta encrypt that shit. Yeah.
4050560	4053440	I don't know. You can come on my wifi. You get what you deserve.
4055600	4061280	I hope you, I hope you access my camera at just, I hope you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
4064000	4069360	Choke on it. Choke on me rubbing my nipple while I grunt horrible
4070320	4074080	minotaur like expressions under my breath. Thank you.
4077200	4086400	I love it. I don't know if I say anything while I check it out. Like if a Superman could tell you.
4087680	4092160	Superman. Do you think, if you were, if you were, if you were, if you were in a feud with Superman,
4092160	4096160	like you could, like, you could, the cool thing is that if you had like a confrontation with him
4096240	4103280	in public, he could be like, you know, I can hear you right now. What are you talking about nerd?
4109040	4112960	My family's not on earth. Why are you obsessed with your family? Everyone has a,
4112960	4118560	why are you talking to me? I don't even know you. Destroy your life.
4119040	4125040	I'm going to, I would love it if Lex looser talks like that. Why are you talking to me?
4125040	4134640	I don't even know you. Stop it. Let me alone. Oh my God. Get over yourself once.
4137280	4141040	I've been watching a lot of DC stuff. Uh, last couple of weeks.
4141040	4152400	Oh, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's an episode. It's a series
4152400	4158160	of the comic books and then they made a direct to video movie. Now you've got my attention.
4158160	4161120	DC, you say,
4167840	4171600	well, cause he's paying attention. He's like, Oh, you've been staying in bed for two weeks in
4171600	4177920	your pajamas and you're watching DC stuff and you're chasing a deadline and you're not, uh,
4177920	4184800	but, um, the, uh, there's this, uh, there's this series where Batman and Superman it's called
4184800	4191040	Batman and Superman, uh, public enemies. Uh, you'd see that one. They made a direct to video movie,
4191040	4197760	uh, uh, with it and, uh, live action, Lex Luther's president and, uh, it's not live action.
4198720	4202800	Who's playing Batman? I don't know. He's playing Batman and Superman. It's,
4202800	4206880	that's interesting to see all of the same guy watching all the Lego and the Paul Dini and the
4206880	4212480	whatever's on the for any mini, the, we said sometimes it's Chris Parnell is playing Superman.
4213120	4218720	Then you go. It's a funny, like recognizing voices and say, Tom Clancy, Tom Clancy, Clancy Brown,
4218720	4224320	Clancy, you know, Tom Clancy, I have never not called Clancy Brown, Tom Clancy. The first time
4225440	4231440	Clancy Brown is so consistently Lex Luther. I really like his, we got Tom Clancy to be the
4231440	4239200	voice of Superman. That's amazing. What does he sound like? I've only read his voice. Do you think,
4239280	4246000	do you think Tom Clancy is at all alive? Like, like, like how has anyone ever seen him? Isn't
4246000	4254880	he like chef boy RD? There's no, how could he ever, there's no fucking way Tom Clancy is anything but
4254880	4264080	a, like a talking night vision scope, uh, on the mantle of a unicorn's dream. I like, like,
4264080	4273040	what would he be? He's more, he's more idea than person. I mean, he's like a heart and lung machine
4273040	4282640	and like, like, what's the latest kind of assault rifle? Are they, are they like bringing video
4282640	4290720	games by and going like Tom it's a, it's a, it's another, uh, it's another call of duty type thing,
4290720	4295680	but there's a zombie add-on pack and it's just, it's still got your name on it. Give me that.
4296240	4298080	Put my glasses on, Sophia.
4301200	4306640	Alone in the world he didn't create. What is this shoe leather? Get rid of that. Get rid of that.
4307840	4314480	Is this a first person? It's, uh, it's actually, uh, over the shoulder third person. Oh,
4314480	4318800	wrong answer. Goodbye. Clancy out.
4322720	4326160	Add another ion lithium cell to my space station.
4329120	4337680	Tom Clancy's 240 years old if he's a day. Yeah. He, or, or, or, or, or was he, when,
4337680	4341680	when we were watching a hunt for Red October, was Tom Clancy like a greaser? Was he like,
4341680	4349120	Hey, chicken D's. Hey, baby, relax. I'm 16. I'm wearing a leather jacket. I just wrote this
4349120	4355920	hunt for Red October, baby. Okay. Cause otherwise he's 200 years old today because that was a million
4355920	4362480	years ago. The greatest impression of a 16 year old ever. Hey, we're going to go to lovers lane.
4362480	4369760	Come on. It's all about. So we locked, we locked Tom Clancy for the voice of Superman. And, uh,
4370720	4375520	Mr. Warner brothers, I think you're going to like what we've done here. Watch the tape.
4378720	4380160	Here comes Superman.
4385920	4391680	Is this a private party or can anyone join?
4391680	4397920	You've gone mad.
4400640	4405920	Do you really think the justice league will bow to your campaign?
4407680	4410800	You need to get out of here, Superman. It's me and rice.
4416480	4419600	This party doesn't need you. I'm catwoman and rise.
4422640	4428320	Was she supposed to say her name? Was I supposed to say my name? No, no, no.
4428320	4431920	I could see through your clothes. I've got vampire side of man. Rice.
4433920	4440320	She's combining her own mythology with stop looking at the camera. When you're
4440880	4449040	thinking about saying stuff out loud, you're like, I can't go to Atlantis. Aquaman's depth filters
4449040	4458320	out the radiation from the yellow sun, sapping my strength. Hey, I'm Deenar Kuntz and I'm Aquaman.
4459360	4466080	Deenar Kuntz. I'm Deenar Kuntz. I'm Aquaman. All right, everybody. Let's get into my
4467680	4474720	Aquabush and Deenar Kuntz is going to take you all the way, all the way down. Everybody get on
4474720	4481360	board. Yeah. Why is everyone identifying themselves? Okay. Okay. Let's just cut the
4481360	4487760	chat. I know I talked to fish, but let's get past that. That joke hasn't been funny for 30 years.
4487760	4492960	All right. Everybody get on the bus. We're going down. Which way we, where are we going, Supes? I
4492960	4499680	hope up so we gather strength. All right. We can only go to the surface of the water though.
4499680	4508720	This is the flying Aquabush. We can go anywhere we want to. It's me, Frozone, played by Alex Haley
4508720	4523040	of Roots fame. Frozone? It's a crossover. From Black's Plateation GI Joe? No. What's Frozone?
4523040	4529040	Who's Frozone? Incredibles. From the Incredibles. Oh, Incredible. His name is Frozone? We had a toy
4529040	4537360	tie-in so they asked me to stop by. Where is my super suit? His name's Frozone? Frozone. That's
4537360	4544240	kind of cool. Frozone. I should watch that movie. I actually, it wasn't the, I saw the incredible,
4544240	4547760	the first Incredibles. Wasn't, is it? So great. Did everybody suffer this effect? Like the,
4547760	4552560	when the Incredibles two came out, didn't you think it was Incredibles three? Because the,
4553280	4559840	the Incredibles was so long ago, but also to their credit, it was so kind of, it hit the spot and it
4559840	4563680	felt like you had had, you're like, Oh, it must've been two Incredibles movies. Cause it's been long
4563680	4569760	enough to be a third one. I referenced it. If I was a person working, or they did, they referenced
4569760	4574400	the amount of time it took. Yeah. I would just, I would, yeah. If you're, if you worked on the
4574400	4580400	Incredibles, I didn't see the second one, but, uh, loved it. But, but, but I wanted to let you
4580400	4586240	know that my reaction to your advertising, uh, uh, uh, uh, was good job on the first movie.
4588160	4593120	So get that gun out of your mouth. You, you, you, you, you little 3d modeler.
4594640	4597600	There's a, you're in a, you're in a cubicle on a sunray.
4599440	4603200	You're going to, that thing's going to slowly move up like the, like the, uh,
4603200	4609680	handicap lady in the gremlins chair. Take you all the way upstairs to a gremlin free retirement.
4610400	4611760	So let's show that clip.
4615680	4616880	We don't have it. Okay.
4619680	4622480	George R R Martin as the flash.
4626560	4633120	I have formed a perimeter around the bank. Okay. So there's a flash TV series, right?
4633840	4640960	Right. Okay. Are there, it's already canceled after 10 seasons premiered yesterday. Right.
4640960	4642560	It's such a fast show
4646080	4651920	for the dad. I want to, I want to know this and I know I, I want to, I've never watched the show.
4652720	4660080	Are there any episodes where it doesn't end with him not running fast?
4660080	4669360	Oh, because if there are, um, why am I tuning in? You know, I mean, like seriously. Okay. Like,
4669360	4673360	okay. Well at the end of the episode, shit, how are we going to get that? Well, I could run fast.
4673360	4678880	Like I mean, like really, I mean, like, is there any episodes like, you know,
4678880	4683040	I'm not going to run fast this week. I'm just going to use my detective mind to figure out
4683040	4688880	who stole the jewels and all the cops are like, yeah, maybe just maybe run fast.
4688960	4692960	Like we'll tell you, we'll tell you the clues and you could like cover more ground. Yeah. You're
4692960	4697760	not, you're not really here because, because you're a really good detective. You're here
4697760	4704000	because you run fast. So why don't you, why don't you run fast and leave the drive into us? Okay.
4704000	4709840	You know, why don't you run fast? I mean, what do they do the third episode? Do we have,
4709840	4714720	do we have any hardcore flash fans? Like, like, like, like it's like your jam. Oh good. It's that
4714800	4720000	section. Is it the, I know. Yeah. I love that this audience was like, no, you're not, man.
4721920	4726720	Knowing that this is a temple in which honesty is rewarded above all. Are you tiger man?
4728560	4734960	Okay. Do you want to come up and talk about the flash? Okay. We won't pick on you.
4737440	4740640	And also you could have been tiger man. That was my point. Like, like we don't,
4740640	4748000	we don't judge anybody here. So you know, you know a lot about, you want to come up and share
4748000	4753360	your love of the flash where you can also stay right there. Oh, that'd be great too. It was just
4753360	4760080	a fucking passing impulse. Uh, I mean, it's not the price. If you're waiting for him to ask a
4760080	4767520	fourth time, if you come up on stage, it might not happen. Okay. Oh, there you go.
4770800	4776800	For a fan of the flash, you are walking pretty slow. Well, that might be that's
4778160	4784400	Superman was created by the two, like, like, like Jewish kids that were like, uh, what'd you say to
4784400	4794000	Brandon? What'd you say to Brandon? Brandon left. What'd you say to Brandon? What's your name?
4794640	4800000	Choco Jacob. Jacob. Yeah. Do your friends call you Jaco? Is that what you said? Jaco first eat
4800000	4805920	that. Eat that mic as a rule. Choco is my last name. Oh, wait. Your name's Jacob Jaco. Choco. Yeah.
4805920	4810800	Oh, Jacob Choco. Yeah. Okay. Well, sorry. We, I guess we docked you. I guess the kids calling
4810880	4814640	that. We can edit your full name out if you want. That's easy. I don't mind. It's fine. All right.
4816240	4821360	People will find you on Facebook and you'll, uh, your life will be ruined. Um,
4822560	4827520	you having a donut with a Oreo on it? Somebody, somebody gave those to us as a gift. Thank you,
4827520	4838960	whoever gave us the donuts. Thank you. Um, uh, Jacob, uh, give us some background. You,
4838960	4842560	you look a little young. Can you tell us how old you are? Otherwise I won't ask.
4842560	4846240	I'm 36. Okay. Well, you're taking good care of yourself. Well,
4847360	4852400	I gave up a little while ago. Yeah. I never asked people. I think are over 30, how old they are.
4852400	4860960	Thank you. Uh, uh, uh, so I thought you were like, uh, 12. Fantastic. You have as many donuts as you
4860960	4871840	want. Um, so, uh, you live in LA. Yeah. I live in Venice beach. Okay. What's the, uh, do you drink
4871840	4877200	alcohol all the time? Great. Do you want, do you want some? I just wanted to make sure that you
4877200	4883920	did cause there's alcohol. Okay. Uh, when does your relationship with the flash start? Uh, I,
4883920	4890160	I read comic books my whole life, but, uh, I watched even the old nineties series of the flash,
4890160	4894160	but I've watched the new one too. Was there a TV series in the nineties? That was the flash.
4894160	4898800	Yeah. Well, I vaguely remember it as a kid. Mark Hamill was on it. It was like,
4899600	4904480	WB. What was it? It was right after like the first Tim Burton Batman.
4905920	4911040	Wait, what did you say? It was right after the first like Tim Burton Batman. It was like 1990.
4911040	4916400	Yeah. I think I maybe vaguely remember that. Yeah. Uh, it was a David Duchovny, right? As the flash
4916640	4924160	didn't work. He just has this like natural kind of, I want to say he's sluggish, but people don't,
4924160	4928480	people don't admire him for his speed. Yeah. That's not quite him. Um, but, uh,
4928480	4933200	just slow down on that donut, man. You got a lot of work to do. You got a lot of work to do, bro.
4933200	4937280	You can put it down, man. Don't let them flash shame you, man. Maybe you eat your donuts fast.
4939120	4943840	Um, uh, so what you look, but, but, uh, all right. Yeah. Just, I mean, just, uh,
4943920	4948400	take us into your, so here's my thing with the flash. You, you were mentioning him and you were
4948400	4954400	asking about his cop work. He's a CSI agent. He's a CSI agent. Yeah. So he, he does like the
4954400	4960800	background work and he's more than just fast. So he doesn't need the super power. It's just a bonus.
4960800	4966720	No, no, it's, it's, I would imagine, I would imagine it's, it's pretty valuable
4966720	4978640	as a CSI agent to get the bonus best superhero ever. Oh my God. He's a really good detective society
4978640	4984080	before he had the flash powers. Then he, then he was a flash. It was great. Is the CIA CSI agent
4984080	4990080	gig. Is that like the equivalent of, of Clark Kent's daily planet gig? That's, that's his alter ego.
4990320	4997760	Is that Barry Allen? Is that his name? Barry Allen. Yeah. Um, and, uh, so when he's fighting crime,
4999280	5005040	he's not slow. He's like, okay, does he, does he, this is the thing about the flash that I don't
5005040	5010240	understand. Cause it's like, it's sort of like if there was a character named like the, the breather
5010240	5016320	and he was like, it was like, I, I breathe, I get more oxygen per there's a so what question of it.
5016320	5021120	It's kind of like, like, like he's moving, he's going to move faster than regular narrative. So
5021680	5025760	like, if he's fighting the kingpin, the kingpin is going to be like, I'm going to rob that bank.
5025760	5031440	And then the flash is like, I heard you're going to rub it anyways. Uh, what does he do? What does
5031440	5036880	the flash do? Does he like punch people? Yeah, mostly at the end of episodes, he'll punch people
5036880	5043040	sometimes faster than they can block it, which was just punching down a little bit. How me
5044000	5054560	know how does being fast make him a better detective other than catching somebody that's
5054560	5062000	running away. Right. Other than that. I mean, like, does he find clues faster? Does he clean up his
5062000	5067840	desk quicker? It's mostly all camera, but I think he's running the test faster. Maybe
5068560	5074160	tests. What tests? He has to take tests, blood tests, blood tests with a mixing motion. He does
5074160	5080400	that faster than a human being. Yeah. He's titrating really fast. And yeah. All right. But that's all
5080400	5084640	that's like Clark Kent, maybe types faster when no one's looking, but, but we're talking with the,
5084640	5088720	you're talking, that's him. That's him. When he goes to work, right? The flash doesn't fight crime
5088720	5094000	by swabbing anything. I assume he's otherwise he wouldn't wear that outfit. He would just wear a
5094080	5100720	lab coat and be fast. See he, he gets in that outfit when something requires it. Right. And so
5100720	5107680	he's out there and he's going to run fast. And by running fast, he's saving the day from villains.
5107680	5115120	Right. By catching him. Catching them, hitting them with lightning. He hit, he had, okay,
5115120	5120560	he has lightning powers. If he runs in a circle fast enough, he can shoot lightning at people.
5120560	5127040	And he does that all the time. Every third episode at least. Why not every episode?
5127760	5130560	Why do you, I mean, like you should be using that to open the door.
5132000	5138240	You would think, but no, he kind of saves it. It's a budgetary. That's his blazing sword. Does he
5138240	5144480	punch and kick a lot? Cause it seems like you could say if he's, I mean, Jackie Chan's efficacy is
5145120	5150320	like a lot of training, but also like, Oh my God, he's so fast. Right. So here we have the fastest
5150400	5154560	guy in the world. So like, even if he's not Jackie Chan, which actually would be kind of
5154560	5160160	funny if he wasn't, that would be amazing if he was just like, kind of like, and, and, but he's
5160160	5165120	just so fast. He gets like nine attacks in before. That's actually more like what he does. He's not
5165120	5170560	very effective, but he, he throws them out. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me ask you this. Okay. So he can
5170560	5176000	run fast. He could move his legs really fast and he can move his arms fast. He can move his fingers
5176000	5181520	fast and he could probably blink fast. Right. He could read fast. He could read fast. Okay. So he
5181520	5187760	can mentally brain is fast. Right. Brain is faster. So is his heart beating faster? Is his
5187760	5193680	blood going faster? I mean, here's where I'm getting at. Does he digest food faster? There's
5193680	5200080	some people who write them like that where he needs to eat more food, but so he's like, I just,
5200080	5205920	I have to shit. I just, I just ate a Cheerio and now I got a poop. That would make sense. Yeah.
5205920	5211920	He must be shitting a lot. Which is, was there an issue about that? I haven't read that one yet,
5211920	5216400	but it's interesting that you say some people write him that way. Right. Are there other,
5216400	5222240	uh, things like that? Are there things that don't exist in a certain writers, uh, flash version?
5222240	5227440	Oh, all comic books. Sorry. This is the podcast for Dan Harmon interrupting people and
5228400	5234480	go ahead, Jacob. Apparently I'm the expert on the flash, but yeah, I think different writers
5234480	5239760	take different liberties with him. I remember, yeah, kid flash jumped out there and he got shot
5239760	5245040	in the knee one episode. And then the next issue, he was in the library for the whole time and
5245040	5250960	learned a bunch of stuff. He wasn't, he, he didn't, so he can't heal fast. Uh, that too,
5250960	5254480	that was just one issue that he was out with the knee. I think it's really important to know
5254560	5259840	whether or not he thinks faster because I want to know if Martian mind hunter, man, man hunter,
5259840	5266480	uh, uh, if he hunts more minds than men, usually. So to be fair, but whose name makes sense in the
5266480	5273040	DC universe, the, the, the, but if Martian man hunter was reading flash his mind, maybe that
5273040	5277520	would be a fun thing where he's like, well, I can't fucking understand a goddamn thing. He's
5278080	5283440	thinking cause it's like, uh, it's like listening to a squirrel. Uh, uh, I think you might've just
5283440	5288880	broke something there. That's something that hasn't been done. So it'd be fun to think about
5288880	5293280	the dialogue that way. Cause they always treat the flash like he's either a cut up
5294160	5300240	or he's an idiot. Like he's sort of like the, like the, the, they treat him like, like in the
5300240	5305680	current like DC film universe, like he's kind of like the combination of like the Troy, uh,
5305680	5310400	community I'm referencing classics so that we have a benchmark. I'm a big fan. Like he's,
5310400	5314000	like he's the, he's the every man kind of thing where he's just like, well, that here's how dope
5314000	5317840	that was kind of thing. Like he's like, he's the youngest town, honestly, where he's like,
5317840	5321440	I just want to be part of the team. Right. And it's a really good detective.
5322880	5327280	I'm a really good detective. I mean, we got Batman here, so I don't know who's the world's
5327280	5333360	greatest detective. So, but he don't run fast. So it evens out, but it's, I think the most
5333360	5337360	interesting thing in the world. Cause, oh, I mean, I did. Yeah. Cause it was like every,
5337360	5341920	like every line of dialogue for the flash, if you were just to like run through the exercise
5341920	5348320	of like, all right, I've got, I'm going to take three hours to, to edit this and write it and all
5348320	5353680	this stuff. And that he like, you know, knowing that he has the power to do that, how does shit
5353680	5358800	come out? And like the end result of that, when you look through the comic book and they're like,
5358800	5363840	it might, it would probably manifest itself as he would be very stoic and which would make him,
5363920	5371040	it would be like, Oh, I get it. He talks very infrequently and he only says like a couple
5371040	5377920	things. And, and so they're, they're doing this contrast thing, but then every once in a while,
5377920	5382480	he'd have like this full dialogue balloon because it took him exactly three hours to like,
5383040	5386640	he's like, I'm just fucking sending this. Like, like, you know, you like edited as much as he
5386640	5391040	could, but it was like, he got triggered so much that he had that. And it's just like you,
5391040	5395840	without warning this guy who usually talks like Groot, like, like all of a sudden it's like,
5395840	5398640	well, the thing is, you've been writing twice about that. There's 70% income,
5401520	5406640	you should be more considerate of people. And you're just like, what the fuck?
5409760	5416640	Does he listen, does he, does he listen faster? Like if he heard himself,
5417280	5421440	does he mature? Does he, does he, does he get woke faster? Was he like,
5422560	5427360	did he realize he had been fucking women up like, like in 2016?
5430560	5438400	Constantly shaving. I mean, like, growing faster, huh? Well, if he does everything faster,
5438400	5442560	does his favorite color look like a Nintendo power up?
5442560	5447360	Oh, no.
5451440	5455040	Yeah. I didn't, I mean, I riffed Nintendo power up. That's what you're sensing.
5455920	5459440	What do you mean? What does that mean, Dan? Fake it till you make it.
5459440	5463360	I was trying to imagine like a, like a 16 bit thing where like the colors cycling, but
5465120	5467760	you know, cause his favorite color keeps changing.
5467760	5472000	It's, it's between like red and yellow gold. I don't know.
5472000	5476240	You don't know those are his favorite colors. What if he, what if he's like Batman and he's like,
5476240	5482080	this will strike fear in my enemies. Red and gold strike fear in slow things.
5483680	5487200	It'll go away from me and I'll go the opposite way.
5487200	5490720	I am most interested in his metabolism. They talk about that a little bit when Ben Affleck
5490720	5494400	went to his, uh, yeah, they did a little bit of the new justice league, but yeah,
5494800	5500160	talk a little bit about it, but they've changed him now into a person that's actually, uh, creating.
5500720	5505920	He's, oh, he's not actually fast because that raises too many questions. Probably it's easier
5505920	5513520	to say that he travels through a fucking, excuse me, a conduit of lightning.
5513520	5519280	Yeah. My favorite rendition of him is he accesses the speed force with another dimension and gives
5519280	5523440	him all sorts of access to slowing down reality for the way he proceeds.
5523440	5533200	I kind of like that idea that, that he's, that of him as a, as a, uh, as a walking inception, uh,
5533200	5539760	pop up during a battle that he's going to do what he's going to do. And the key to using the flash
5539760	5545360	right is to give him explicit instructions because you're not going to have another chance. Right.
5545360	5550480	And, and it's better to use him. Like if you don't have a really good plan for him,
5550480	5558480	you should just tell him like, uh, like when in doubt, stop everyone from being hurt or something
5558480	5564240	like that. And that you're, you're, you're checking back in with him in a way that's like
5565040	5569120	how it would look from the perspective of like plant life or something. He's behind the scenes
5569120	5575600	making all sorts of moves and we're all just, Oh, you're here. Yeah. Jacob, why do you know
5575600	5580640	so much about the flash? I've been reading comic books since I don't know. I was 10 years old.
5580640	5584880	Yeah. Eat that Mike Jacob. He's been reading. I've been reading comic books since I was like
5584880	5592480	10 years old. So brothers and sisters. Yeah. I have an older sister. She lives here in Los Angeles
5592480	5597680	on an emotional level on a personal level. Is there a connection to the flash? That's like,
5597680	5605280	you're like, like, okay. So just an example, like the day it was like, Tony Stark was like,
5606160	5612800	here's my kryptonite. I love booze. Um, I was like sold like, like, like,
5614560	5619040	how can you get better than this person? Like, like, like it was there,
5619040	5625040	it was there like a flash thing, a moment for me with flash. Well, for me, the flash
5625040	5631680	moment for me was when, uh, kid flash got shot in the knee and he said, who am I? And he, and he
5631680	5637280	went, I'll go to the library. Yeah. He went to the library and he said, I'm gonna read some things.
5637280	5642320	I'm gonna, I'm gonna be better, a better person. And then I thought, you know, it was more than
5642320	5647600	just the powers. He got, wait, I'm sorry. He got shot in the knee. He was, he was, he was,
5647600	5653120	he was a baby flash and he was already fast. Yeah. So actually this wasn't even Barry Allen.
5653120	5659040	This was his grandson or whatever. And he gets shot in the knee by Deathstroke in an issue.
5659040	5663360	Oh, cause Deathstroke can't, even the flash, he can't, even a baby flash, he can't miss.
5663360	5667440	He can't, he figured it out. He timed him out and he shot him in the knee, took him out.
5669840	5673760	Congratulations, Mrs. Deathstroke, Deathstroke's mom. You must be very proud.
5674400	5680240	He shot baby flash on the knee. He is officially, yes. Good job.
5680560	5686240	Oh wait, I'm thinking of Deadshot. That's the guy who's always bragging about how he never misses.
5686240	5690640	You said Deathstroke. He's different from Deadshot. Deathstroke is just like,
5690640	5696240	like, it looks like Deadpool and he just strokes to death. Yeah. All right. Sorry. I didn't mean
5696240	5701280	to derail you. That's probably my, my favorite flash moment, but Captain America has always
5701280	5706880	been. So is it because baby flash, having been shot in the knee was like, well, I'm still fast.
5706880	5712640	I'm going to go to the library and get like a PhD examination. How do I grow as a person? I'm,
5712640	5718880	I'm not a good superhero. I let down my whole team and I'm shot in the knee. I can't run fast
5718880	5724880	anymore. So what am I worth? He went and explored himself and he came back and you know, he made a
5724880	5731680	difference. Did he like learn any new talents? He learned all sorts of chemistry and bio. I don't
5731680	5735040	know. I don't know. He was learning. He was, was he learning faster? Yeah. He was learning
5735040	5743440	way faster. So you read the library, baby. Who's fast? Who's faster? Who's faster? Okay. Okay.
5745200	5754160	Flash Superman. Go flash. No doubt. No doubt. Who swims faster? Slasher Aquaman.
5754160	5760240	Spins faster. Swims faster. Oh, but who does spin faster?
5762720	5769760	I'll go with the flash in any scenario, space, water, air, anywhere. Flashes is the fastest.
5769760	5773120	How come, how come Superman and the flash are always having races and then they're like neck
5773120	5778400	and neck. Whoa. I think flash is just, you know, try to throw him a bone. Really? He seems so
5778400	5783040	uptight about it. The flash? Yeah. He doesn't seem like he's throwing anyone a bone. Of the two of
5783120	5787920	them, who's more uptight? Superman or flash flash is having fun. I don't think, I think Superman
5787920	5794480	wishes he was slower. I, I, I, I think I don't think Superman is the kind of guy that's like,
5794480	5798640	I should race you. I heard your name is the flash. He enjoys racing the flash. He's like,
5798640	5802880	Oh, this is one time I can let loose. It's one time I might lose. And I'm going to lose. Which
5802880	5808480	says a lot about Superman. I E that he, yeah, he's coming in low. He wants to lose. So,
5808480	5812320	so that flies in the face of the theory that flash is throwing Superman a bone.
5813280	5817120	Oh, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Wait, wait. No, maybe we're both right and wrong. I get it. I get it.
5817120	5824000	I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so Superman is the provocateur because he's so masochistic.
5824000	5830640	He's like, Hey, you want to race? I hope I lose. I hope I lose. Oh, Superman. So dark.
5830640	5835280	I think so. I think that's like the most forgiving reading of Superman, but yeah. Yeah.
5835280	5843360	Has the flash. Okay. So the flash, I know he can run across water because he's so fast.
5843360	5846000	So can Superman. They often race around the world.
5849760	5855760	So my question is, and I think you've already answered it. Has the flash ran across the ocean?
5856480	5861680	Yeah. He's run all across the whole planet many times. Yeah. He'll do it. He won't even
5861680	5866320	get on a plane. He's like, I'd rather run across the ocean. Yeah. I'm not even going to put on the
5866320	5873040	suit. Right. Does he put that on? Because also no one's going to go. What Barry Allen is the flash.
5873040	5877760	This changes everything. Yeah. Catch me. Fuck your head. Oh my God. That's Arthur Curry.
5878880	5883280	Yeah. Try to catch him. I'm carrying him. Alex Haley is frozen.
5883280	5896000	If the flash is running across the ocean and Aquaman is trying to, let's say the Riddler is
5896000	5902720	in the water. Okay. And he's drowning because Wonder Woman's ropes around him. And so the
5902720	5910320	Riddler is saying, honestly, I'm drowning. I swear to God. I have no reason to lie to you. I'm drowning.
5910320	5919600	And so Aquaman's heading towards the Riddler. So is the flash. Is it possible that the flash
5919600	5925680	would kick Aquaman in the face? Yeah. And if he did, would he kill him, kill him, kill him,
5925680	5931040	because it's like a bullet. Well, he's the king of Atlantis. You probably shoot Aquaman in the face
5931040	5936960	with a gun with those hips. Oh yeah. I don't know why not. Did you shoot Aquaman in the face?
5937920	5942640	I think the flash could kill Aquaman in pretty much any scenario. I don't know how y'all feel
5942640	5948640	about that, but I give the flash KO in that scenario for sure. Oh, wow. Well, what I was
5948640	5954240	going to say is if the flash is running across water and he steps on anything other than water,
5954240	5963840	be it Aquaman's face in this case, would he trip and then he would fall in the water, right?
5963840	5966880	Yeah. Okay. Good. Because I'm just working on the script tonight.
5970880	5982880	Just wanted to run this scene by you. So you said the flash could move the fastest in space.
5984160	5992000	Yeah. He's been in space and how did the flash could run in space? It's all about the
5992000	5997920	speed force. The speed force is an interdimensional force that allows him to access speed in any
5997920	6006320	dimension. Oh, cool. Well, that's not, thank you for taking that. That's not a very nice way to
6006320	6012160	respond to an answer to a question you asked. He wanted the answer, yeah. I mean, it doesn't
6012160	6016960	have to make sense. He does that to me a lot. Like he's like, oh, tell me what, you know,
6016960	6020000	can you really, really, I really care. Tell me what you're doing. And then I'll answer and he'll
6020000	6029760	go like nerd. Wow. Uh, okay. So he can run in space. He can run on water. He can, he can run on
6029760	6040080	space, but he's not running. He's going to interdimensional. What's it? Wait, how can he
6040080	6045600	get, how does speed force make it so that he can move through space? Speed force. Isn't it the
6046080	6052160	I assumed that I had to say when I heard speed force, yeah, I immediately pictured this whole
6052160	6057840	fucking like subset of comic books about all the people that hang out with the flash. And I was
6057840	6067600	like, I will fully ignore it. I didn't want to hear a goddamn thing about it. Well, there's, uh,
6067600	6069600	shortcut,
6070400	6074800	so he's your foot and, uh, shortcuts. Twelve has red hair and pigtails.
6076560	6077760	Get back here. Shortcut.
6080240	6085120	But is that way is speed force. Is it refer? I assumed to look like a task force. No,
6085120	6089040	it's like a force of nature. Yeah, it's a force of nature. Okay. It's like a dimension that he
6089040	6095600	accesses to do his thing. And there are people there. There's Jesse quick and all sorts of folks.
6095680	6103120	Jesse. I knew it. I knew it. I knew there was a speed force. Jesse quick. I mean,
6103120	6106080	they're not going to stop printing these comic books. They're not going to, they're not going
6106080	6110800	to be like, well, maybe no one will want to read this one. They're going to keep doing it until it,
6110800	6117760	until it fucking until it's dry as a, how did he become the flash? He spilled some chemicals on
6117760	6122080	himself. They got struck by lightning. It's a bullshit. He's, wait, wait, wait. I mean,
6122240	6127760	it's true. It's lazy, but it is true. He spilled some chemicals. What were they?
6127760	6132400	Janitorial supplies. He can find them at any home hit by lightning.
6132400	6137360	Hey guy by lightning. Yeah. But on the same day that he's, if you want to get like really into
6137360	6143040	the flash lore, he is now lightning bolt that struck himself and he gave himself his powers.
6143040	6145840	It gets really complicated. Yeah.
6145840	6155680	Oh, because of, because of the infinite crisis, did, did, did, did Brainiac, uh,
6155680	6162400	make power girl into a fucking storm cloud after, after earth two was, but you know, too much.
6162400	6167760	Well, I'm, I'm, I'm getting too much from Wikipedia. I'm like, just tell me who fucking
6167760	6173200	black canary is. I, like, I, I know the first paragraph of every single one of these fucking
6173200	6177280	people is like, this is the name of several characters. I'm like, no, it's not. Just tell
6177280	6185200	me the fuck she is. What does she got a knife in her boot? Probably, but I'm not the one to
6185200	6191760	help you with her. Well, she sings in people's faces and stuff. She's saying, uh, uh, superman
6191760	6196800	and Batman public enemies. Here's a, let's, here's a new story. Here's a new segment. Uh,
6196800	6202480	Dan Harmon problematizes, uh, uh, the, the, uh, things that don't need to be problematized.
6203360	6207680	Uh, boom, but do, do, do, sometimes you've got a problem.
6214240	6219280	Superman. Oh man, we're done. I fucking did it. Okay. Super Superman and Batman is Lex
6219280	6223520	losers president in this public enemies thing. And, and, uh, Superman and Batman are like,
6224080	6228000	they have to move in together. I can't remember the circumstance, but they're like,
6228000	6232960	it's like, oh, uh, Superman goes for, there's a, there's a comic coming towards earth.
6232960	6237520	It's a kryptonite comic. Yeah. And Superman goes to have a meeting with Lex Luthor. And, and, and,
6237520	6242800	and Batman's like, don't go to that meeting and whatever, you know, fast forward. So it's like,
6242800	6248960	it turns out, yeah, Batman and Superman are like buddy cops who are like, uh, framed for trying to
6248960	6257760	kill president Luther. And they're like on the lamb together. And, uh, um, uh, uh, all of the,
6257760	6262800	Lex Luthor puts a bounty on their heads. So all of the, uh, DC villains are trying to kill Superman.
6265360	6271040	And one of them is Banshee. You guys know Banshee. Um, she, she comes, she comes flying out of the
6271040	6287520	woods and he just takes her up into space and she passes out and he flies her down and he says to
6287520	6295520	Batman, oh my God, these guys don't hang out that much, but Superman says to Batman, she'll, she'll
6295520	6305680	be out for a while. Uh, but, um, do you have anything for her screaming? And Batman responds
6305680	6314640	like he's been asked for Advil. He's like, yeah. And he puts a disc on her throat and says,
6314640	6321200	this hypersonic electromagnetic thing will conduct her scream power and make it hurt her,
6321360	6326640	make her screams hurt her more than they hurt other people. Batman, why is that in your pocket?
6327680	6333840	Superman, why is your first move to fly them up to the exact height where they fall in consciousness?
6333840	6340240	Why aren't the two of you so fucking simpatico? There was barely any conversation. It was like,
6340240	6347520	fuck it. It was like, uh, he comes out of the woods and he's just like, what the fuck?
6347520	6353840	Who the fuck? All I know is this bitch won't, try screaming without air, takes him down to his
6353840	6359680	vigilante friend and goes, look, I, oh, here's what I know. She'll be out for a while. Superman's
6359680	6366880	done this a thousand times. Hey, hey, hey bats. I just find, I just invented a new way to killing
6366880	6374320	people. I'm knocking them out. I could grab them by the lapels and go up to space. He does it three
6374320	6382800	times and then just drop them the fuck down. Why does he do that? Superman does it so many times
6382800	6388880	in that series that I watch like regular Superman stuff. And I'm like, well, you got, you got them.
6390080	6394320	And whenever he like, whenever he like throws someone, I'm like, why don't you do your fucking
6394320	6398800	move? Yeah, you got like, like, like, I would never stop mashing that a button.
6398800	6409600	That is, that is, that is so fucking dark. Like, like he went, oh, I never thought of that before.
6410560	6416720	There's a bank robbery. Oh, I got this. All right. Everybody put your goddamn hands in the air.
6416720	6420320	I'm gonna blow your fucking head up. Excuse me. Going up. What are you? Oh my God.
6420320	6428880	How about this? Hey, Martian, Martian Manhunter, a scan for all the people that are, they're
6428880	6437840	thinking they might want to rob a bank. Hey, Flash, quickly learned to forge a contest
6438720	6443120	injury for people who all get to rob a bank. Like, like, if you start just like,
6443120	6448160	he just like gathers people in buses and like full of people who are thinking about robbing banks
6448160	6453360	and just like soaring them into space and they're like, I didn't just like take them down. Like,
6453360	6458720	it was just like filling stadiums full of buses for the people who might fucking have the wrong
6458720	6463520	thoughts. He's like, why am I making this so hard for myself? Making them save the world,
6463520	6468960	Superman emptying their guns while they're shooting at my chest. I could just grab the
6468960	6476080	fuckers and go up. I mean, you're an alien. You can't die. Use it or lose it. You're not going
6476080	6481760	to fit in while you're helping people. No one likes people saving them. Everyone needs it. Stop
6481760	6488560	fitting in. Save us. Christ. Like just fucking like shit, like kill everyone that's bad. Yeah.
6488560	6494240	And, and, and tell us how to be. We'll wear red capes. Uh, he just, well, I'm sure he does it
6494240	6498880	like some joker version. Read Red Son. It's a great story about Superman being a Russian.
6499840	6508000	Right. All right. Well. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
