0	11000	This is taught by our friend Titanic Sinclair, who always thinks of grooving his stuff.
11000	13000	Look up Titanic on my end.
13000	15000	From Harman Town.
15000	18000	Oh yeah, from Harman Town. We're in Harman Town.
18000	22000	In Hollywood, California. Welcome once again. Harman Town is now in session.
23000	36000	So many friends. Spencer Fittman, everybody. Spencer.
36000	43000	Whoo!
43000	49000	Rock-trotch!
57000	60000	That's our show. Good night. Thanks for coming.
60000	63000	How about the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman?
63000	72000	Thank you. Thank you.
72000	74000	What a show. What a show we have tonight.
74000	80000	What a show! We got so much planned for you tonight.
80000	84000	Brought to you by Dr. Pepper.
84000	87000	Alright, I came up with a bit. I have a bit.
87000	88000	Here comes the bit.
88000	92000	I have a real bit. Do you have a segment music for a real bit I have?
92000	98000	Yeah.
98000	107000	Sometimes you think of a real bit and it just seems like something that a real comic would do.
107000	113000	Okay, so you know how everybody thinks professional wrestling is fake?
113000	114000	Right.
114000	115000	Okay. Yes.
115000	122000	Alright. I just decided last night. I'm already messing up the bit.
122000	127000	That I think all other wrestling is fake.
127000	132000	And then, because you can't tell me that for 6,000 years,
132000	135000	teams of people have been getting together and dressing the same
135000	137000	and trying to pin each other on a mat.
137000	146000	Nobody thought to bring a snake or a 2x4?
146000	147000	Yeah.
147000	153000	So 14 more years of that and I'd have like a strong 10 minutes.
153000	155000	Thank you.
155000	158000	So right now.
158000	163000	But in the meantime, back to the regular show, which is nothing.
163000	169000	You're like 59 minutes short of a full HBO comedy special.
169000	173000	Is the microphone supposed to be back further? Don't you guys like it when it's back further?
173000	175000	I liked it better.
175000	177000	I liked it better, too.
177000	181000	I'm not talking to you.
181000	187000	Okay. Thank you for the mushrooms last night.
187000	191000	So Dan and I, Dan and I and Cody, we did mushrooms.
191000	196000	And we went to a fancy restaurant, which is a terrible idea.
196000	198000	I didn't know we were going to have dinner.
198000	199000	Jeff in the car.
199000	202000	What did you think you were going to do at the restaurant?
202000	203000	Exercise?
203000	205000	I didn't know we were going to a restaurant.
205000	209000	Jeff in the car on the way to the Bel Air Hotel.
209000	214000	You should take them now because that way, because they take an hour to kick in.
214000	221000	I don't know when we took them, but exactly an hour after we took them, we were at a Mature D station.
221000	224000	I didn't know we were having a fancy dinner.
224000	232000	In a restaurant where everybody was like, that better be Peter Jackson.
232000	237000	Because otherwise it's homeless Hodor.
237000	240000	It was just dressed while I was wearing these clothes.
240000	247000	Jeff was wearing a suit and then we ordered the food and then it came and it looked like Beetlejuice.
247000	249000	My appetizer was terrifying.
249000	254000	It looked like my salad was talking to me and it was wild.
254000	259000	In my memory, what you ordered looked like an Indian headdress.
259000	260000	Yes, it did.
260000	265000	It was like there were leaves coming out of different colors.
265000	269000	It was the Mayan sacrifice movie that Mel Gibson produced.
269000	270000	Buckle up dough.
270000	272000	My meal looked like a Buckle up dough.
272000	273000	Buckle up dough.
273000	276000	He ordered the Apokolipto.
276000	279000	Sorry, I'll phase this way too sometimes.
279000	281000	Cody was laughing like crazy.
281000	283000	Dan, you looked really paranoid.
283000	285000	I was upset.
285000	288000	I just said, hey, why don't you guys take a walk.
288000	291000	I'll take care of the dinner.
291000	297000	I pretended like I was your handler, like your manager, because I had a suit on.
297000	305000	I said, Mr. Harmon and Cody, they found out they had to leave.
305000	309000	May I please get their food to go for them and I'll take care of it.
309000	312000	We're like running around in the front.
312000	315000	I'm a seagull.
315000	320000	I enjoyed my dinner and it was trippy because I was sitting there.
320000	325000	When you're on mushrooms, you're very self-aware.
325000	329000	You feel like everybody else is also kind of aware of you, but maybe they're not at all.
329000	336000	But now I'm just a dude in a suit with all three people's food in front of me.
336000	337000	I made it out of there alive.
337000	343000	I had a couple drinks and I tip pretty big on your card, so I'll help you like that.
343000	352000	Harmon is sitting out by himself at a fountain and he's got his left hand in the fountain.
352000	355000	The water is trickling on his hand.
355000	356000	I go over there.
356000	358000	You were like the fountain was talking to you.
358000	363000	I laid my palm on top of the surface of the water.
363000	371000	When I dipped it beneath the surface, my hand became an ape's hand.
371000	378000	If I lowered it, it became an alien hand because apes are more sophisticated than aliens.
378000	383000	The more primitive the life, the more advanced it is because the more primitive the life,
383000	391000	the more it is able to contact me because it's based on water and water is the conduit.
391000	399000	As I kept my palm on top, when Jeff came up, I had just figured out that if I keep my palm on the top of the water,
399000	405000	I can listen to all life.
405000	408000	Do you know what it said?
408000	409000	What did it say?
409000	410000	What did all life say?
410000	417000	It said, tell our story.
417000	418000	I will.
418000	421000	And I will.
421000	425000	Life hitched a dragon to the right star that night.
425000	431000	I see your story set in the old west, but with Andy Dick as the sheriff.
431000	434000	Someone pay me.
434000	438000	I watched Aliens.
438000	440000	That's what I did last night.
440000	442000	Steve's got cups.
442000	443000	We need those.
443000	444000	Thank you, Steve.
444000	449000	Steve Levy, everybody.
449000	451000	Watch the second half of Aliens.
451000	452000	That's a good movie.
452000	453000	It still holds up.
453000	454000	It's fun.
454000	455000	The second one?
455000	457000	The first Aliens.
457000	458000	Oh, don't.
458000	459000	I mean, okay.
459000	460000	There was only one.
460000	462000	The second movie in the Alien franchise.
462000	463000	Right.
463000	464000	And I watched the second half of it.
464000	465000	Right.
465000	467000	Just the second half?
467000	468000	Just the second half.
468000	473000	My favorite line in that movie is not Game Over Man, but in that same conversation.
473000	477000	Because Bill Paxton did this.
477000	479000	She's like, she knows the way around this.
479000	483000	And he's just like, why don't you put her in charge?
483000	484000	And I didn't do it.
484000	486000	I don't know if you keep it score.
486000	488000	We just got our asses kicked back there.
488000	490000	All the other ones, I feel like, well, it's Bill Paxton.
490000	493000	It's sort of like Bill Paxton.
493000	496000	It's great because in the sense of like, oh, Christopher Walken or Nicholson,
496000	499000	it's like a caricature of himself.
499000	501000	But that line, why don't you put her in charge?
501000	504000	I kind of also, I was like immediately, I was like, yeah, what the fuck is going on, man?
504000	506000	We're going to get killed.
506000	507000	You know what I mean?
508000	510000	There was a tunnel to his soul.
510000	511000	Paul Reiser.
511000	512000	Paul Reiser's very good in that.
512000	513000	Paul Reiser's great in it.
513000	516000	That whole movie is like a slam dunk.
516000	517000	Slam dunk.
517000	519000	That's a slam dunk.
519000	520000	Spencer, you ever done mushrooms?
520000	521000	Are you a mushroom guy?
521000	522000	No, man.
522000	525000	Because here's the thing they say about mushrooms.
525000	526000	You know what they say?
526000	530000	They say, if you think you're going to have a good time, you will.
530000	532000	And I can't think I'm going to have a good time.
532000	533000	Yeah, well.
533000	536000	Yeah, I know what you mean.
536000	541000	Well, people freak you out by saying it's like this weird, mobius strip of like, oh,
541000	544000	if you think it's possible to have a bad trip, then you will have a bad trip.
544000	547000	No, I only think it's possible to have a bad trip.
547000	549000	And yeah, I understand completely.
549000	550000	Same thing.
550000	554000	I just took, you know, I wanted my, I didn't want my girlfriend to think I was a pussy.
554000	556000	Filthy fucking hippies.
556000	560000	But Cody had a bad time.
560000	563000	We both kind of had overall a bad time.
563000	566000	I don't think it was worth it to just communicate with all of life.
566000	568000	But I think if you, like.
568000	570000	She was saying like demons were coming out.
570000	573000	We only took enough to have kind of a bad ecstasy trip.
573000	578000	Like, it wasn't, it wasn't like, we didn't, like, I think the point of psilocybin is supposed
578000	582000	to be ideally that you, and they're using it to treat post-traumatic stress now because,
582000	587000	and other ailments, because psilocybin has a clinically measurable effect of something
587000	590000	previously thought to be immeasurable, which is perspective.
590000	595000	Like, you actually take enough of it and you walk away with the sense that you are part
595000	596000	of a larger whole.
596000	600000	And it's sort of like they give it to, like, you know, people that were in Iraq and got
600000	606000	blown to bits and are, you know, having trouble coping with that stress and shoving it down.
606000	610000	And they experimented with giving them psilocybin.
610000	613000	And so they're finally doing some scientific research into these effects.
613000	617000	I think if you don't take quite enough to push you through onto Jim Morrison's other
617000	620000	side, that you simply are just, like, super aware of yourself.
620000	624000	Because I got out of the shower and I was just, like, staring at myself in the mirror.
624000	630000	And I knew that I was disgusting, but I was also, like, I was like, I'm beautiful.
630000	635000	Like, Cody, after like 20 minutes, she's like, baby, okay.
635000	637000	And I said, yeah, I'm an ape.
637000	639000	Like, I just know that I'm an ape.
639000	641000	And I was, like, I was just naked.
641000	646000	And all of the patterns of my body hair and how they were revealing that I had descended
646000	650000	from an ape that had gone through a semi-aquatic phase.
650000	653000	That's right.
653000	654000	That's why we're hairless.
654000	656000	That's looking up.
656000	657000	Elaine Morgan's aquatic ape theory.
657000	662000	And it was being proven to me because the scintillating drips of water were following this,
662000	665000	like, you know, this, like, perfect, like, pattern.
665000	668000	And it was just like this, you know, everything moves when you're on mushrooms.
668000	675000	I was like, my big pink round gut was, like, pulsating like this, like, cocoon full of baby apes.
675000	681000	And I was just, like, I was just going like this and watching my belly button and my nipples, like,
681000	684000	turn into this mouth going, like, rah!
684000	686000	This face going, like...
686000	688000	It sounds like you had enough.
688000	689000	I had.
689000	691000	I did, but it was all kind of up here.
691000	692000	It was all about the self.
692000	694000	And I think that a true mushroom...
694000	695000	I told you guys to take three.
695000	696000	You only take two, right?
696000	700000	Yeah, kids, if you're doing it, take more.
700000	705000	And tell the cops, I said it was all right.
705000	709000	The first time I ever did mushrooms, I was with Jason Sudeikis and a friend of his from Second City.
709000	712000	We were in Vegas, and he was doing a show at the...
712000	715000	Dude, this story is such horse shit.
715000	721000	I'm so sick of you telling this story about you and Jason Sudeikis and his comedy friends, like, taking mushrooms.
721000	723000	I know it's fucking not true.
723000	727000	I was in the bathroom, and I heard knock, knock, knock.
727000	729000	And Jason Sudeikis is outside saying, hey, man, you okay?
729000	731000	Because we were just taking mushrooms.
731000	733000	And I was like, yeah, I'm cool.
733000	735000	I'm just talking to the shampoos right now.
735000	737000	Because the shampoos, he had a bunch of...
737000	740000	He and his roommate, they were doing a comedy show at the Flamingo,
740000	743000	and they were singing, like, a place near where Tupac got killed, I think.
743000	747000	And they had all these stolen hotel shampoos,
747000	750000	and they were like a little choir of angels singing to me.
750000	752000	I'm like, I'm cool. I'm just singing with the shampoos.
752000	755000	And Jason's like, all right, see you.
755000	758000	I was trying to tee up like a fancy, like a clever...
758000	760000	I knew what you were doing.
760000	763000	Who else did you do mushrooms with? Will Forte?
763000	766000	Will Forte is one of the biggest fucking pussies in the world.
766000	768000	He would never do drugs. He would never do it.
768000	771000	If he were here and Jason Sudeikis were here,
771000	775000	they would both fucking kick your ass or be mad.
775000	778000	Let's bring out Jason Sudeikis and Will Forte!
785000	790000	Whoo!
790000	792000	Whoo!
792000	794000	Whoo!
794000	798000	Whoo!
798000	802000	Whoo!
802000	805000	All right.
805000	806000	Thank you, Will.
806000	807000	Hey, Will, reception.
807000	809000	I'm sorry about the whole pussy remark.
809000	810000	That's all right.
810000	811000	Okay, I feel bad about that.
811000	814000	He didn't know you were here.
814000	817000	You look a lot tougher now, Will, with the shaved head thing.
817000	819000	You look much more like you might kick my ass for real.
819000	822000	Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
822000	825000	That's half the battle, just looking like it.
825000	826000	Yeah, yeah.
826000	830000	Are you still shooting Last Man on Earth this season's Last Man on Earth?
830000	834000	No, we finished a couple months ago, so we start writing on Tuesday.
834000	835000	Oh, okay.
835000	839000	So you actually sit in the writer's room like full services, but you can't.
839000	841000	At a certain point, there's overlap, right?
842000	848000	There's overlap, so then at that point, we do the acting all day,
848000	850000	and then I've got to write at night, Sunday, and weekends.
850000	851000	No, that's not true.
851000	852000	Come on.
852000	854000	No, no, I don't mean that to be like you're lazy.
854000	856000	Literally, acting in a scene.
856000	859000	I'm acting in a scene with them, and it's like, okay, cut, we're going to turn around.
859000	862000	I go this way because our chairs and the food is over this way.
862000	865000	Will goes this way, and then there's a laptop open,
865000	868000	and works on the laptop the whole time.
868000	870000	I was like, yeah, I'll do the show.
870000	873000	It'll be fun to hang out with you and act with you.
873000	876000	It was like, we only have to pretend to hang out.
876000	880000	We got paid, but then you left, and then you went to go do his other job.
880000	882000	Literally, during the day.
882000	883000	That's pretty remarkable.
883000	884000	I worked very hard.
884000	885000	I'm a very hard worker.
885000	886000	It's incredible.
886000	887000	He really is.
887000	890000	Are you writing that episode?
890000	891000	Are you writing future episodes?
891000	892000	Are you freestyling as he does?
892000	895000	He's rewriting episodes that have already aired.
895000	896000	He's nuts.
896000	897000	He's nuts.
898000	900000	Also, different shows.
900000	901000	He's doing 227 episodes.
901000	902000	Improving them, though.
902000	903000	All of them better.
903000	905000	Jack A has never been sassier.
908000	909000	Is this alcoholic?
909000	910000	Yeah.
911000	912000	Where's that coming from?
912000	913000	Do you want a drink?
913000	914000	Oh, I'm sorry.
914000	915000	Let's drink that one.
915000	916000	No, that's all right.
917000	919000	Who's running Last Man on Earth?
919000	929000	It's Andy, Bob Rowe, and Eric Durbin now is coming in to co-show run.
929000	930000	Oh, okay.
930000	932000	Because Bob Rowe, you finally figured it out.
932000	933000	He's a fucking...
933000	934000	He's the worst.
934000	935000	He's not good.
936000	937000	No, he's fantastic.
937000	938000	I love him so much.
938000	943000	I was talking to Monica Patrick, an old community writer.
943000	946000	We were at the Hotel Evan Brunch.
946000	950000	Everybody's scattered to the 85 winds now.
950000	953000	There's a community person everywhere because we did six seasons.
953000	955000	I'm sure some of them are like...
955000	958000	I'm sure they all hate me, but I'm sure also some of them...
958000	961000	I'm nostalgic about just the family of it all.
961000	964000	Each season, it's like, oh, man, season three was great.
964000	966000	We had so-and-so and such-and-such.
966000	969000	I was looking at the Yahoo season and even thinking,
969000	971000	I don't know what I'm explaining to you.
971000	975000	No, just the expanse of it after it all.
975000	979000	It's the same way at SNL or even when I watch TV and I bore Olivia with,
979000	982000	oh, I did Second City with that guy in that commercial.
982000	983000	It's like us.
983000	987000	I would say even me, you and Jeff, we've known each other for 20-plus years,
987000	988000	that idea of...
988000	990000	I guess that's the feeling of family.
990000	992000	That's why grandparents are like,
992000	997000	it'd be nice to hear from you once in a while because they only run two shows
997000	1004000	in their life for 30 seasons each as a mother and a grandmother.
1004000	1006000	And then they're like, nice to see you.
1006000	1008000	How did you guys meet the first time then?
1008000	1009000	The three of you.
1009000	1011000	Comedy Sports in Kansas City, actually.
1011000	1013000	Yeah, because Dan was Milwaukee Comedy Sports.
1013000	1014000	Jason was Kansas City.
1014000	1017000	I was L.A. and Rob is obviously a Milwaukee.
1017000	1018000	Obviously.
1018000	1020000	Just look at me.
1020000	1022000	Look at how Milwaukee is.
1022000	1023000	You weren't at that tournament, I don't think.
1023000	1024000	Were you at Kansas City?
1024000	1025000	I don't think I was invited.
1025000	1027000	There was a Kansas City tournament.
1027000	1028000	You were probably invited.
1028000	1029000	I was probably invited.
1029000	1030000	Everyone's allowed to go.
1030000	1031000	Everybody's allowed to go.
1031000	1041000	You guys became an 80s mattress commercial for a second.
1041000	1042000	Sorta, sorta.
1042000	1043000	Springer, Springer.
1043000	1046000	A galaxy of savings, galaxy of savings.
1046000	1051000	Jason, you were in a group with our friend Jeremy Carter who's in Super Ego.
1051000	1052000	We all...
1052000	1057000	Not every city, but a lot of the cities in Comedy Sports, when we went to a tournament,
1057000	1064000	there were kind of a younger crew that we all kind of circled around each other and became friends
1064000	1067000	and we all have remained friends, which is really crazy.
1067000	1069000	We all were kind of annoyed at our bosses.
1069000	1070000	I mean, blessed all their hearts.
1070000	1071000	Right.
1071000	1072000	But I remember...
1072000	1073000	Name names.
1073000	1074000	Name names.
1074000	1077000	James Bailey, Clancy Hathaway, and Dick Chud now.
1077000	1078000	Yeah.
1078000	1079000	I know all their names.
1079000	1080000	I remember their names.
1080000	1084000	Teenage Anger doesn't go away that quick.
1085000	1088000	I'm still making money off it.
1088000	1092000	We went all just like talk shit about our kind of bosses.
1092000	1094000	What kind of shit?
1097000	1100000	Well, they were just never doing anything right in our minds.
1100000	1101000	Yeah, the bosses.
1101000	1108000	We were 22 and we were like, we were so funny and like, oh, so-and-so is paying us $20 a show.
1108000	1110000	It doesn't give us gas money.
1110000	1112000	Doesn't he know how to run a thing?
1112000	1113000	And they didn't.
1113000	1114000	No, but they were great.
1114000	1115000	We wouldn't have all met each other.
1115000	1116000	We wouldn't have met the friends.
1116000	1117000	I mean, yeah.
1117000	1118000	You'd have to be the boss.
1118000	1121000	I wouldn't have gotten on whose line if I didn't do 10 years of short form improv.
1121000	1122000	Right.
1122000	1123000	That was a school for that.
1123000	1124000	Yeah.
1124000	1127000	But we all eventually said, fuck this shit and like moved on.
1127000	1132000	And I'm not an actor, but of course, as a writer and producer, Comedy Sports gave me all my people skills.
1136000	1139000	It helps you when you're dealing with the network.
1139000	1142000	I would have been a real bad apple in their eyes.
1142000	1149000	If I hadn't learned to say yes and every fucking idiot, they still don't like me.
1151000	1152000	Well, I don't know.
1152000	1158000	So let's talk about writer-actor hybrids because you're talking about-well, I just don't even-I mean,
1158000	1162000	I really want to get my head around that because I'm having pings of insane jealousy there
1162000	1169000	with the idea of you being on set, having sold a show, created it, developed it,
1169000	1172000	and now you're on the set and you're still running over to the laptop.
1172000	1176000	Like, I've got such a man crush on you for that.
1180000	1182000	I told you this would be fun.
1185000	1187000	I didn't know that I would meet somebody.
1188000	1199000	In the scene that he's describing, are you-is what's on the laptop scenes that are about to shoot that week,
1199000	1201000	or is it like a next episode?
1201000	1209000	No, we will-every once in a while you'll get into a case where you're writing stuff for stuff that week,
1209000	1213000	but usually it's jamming out the stuff that's coming the following week.
1214000	1220000	I mean, ideally you're to a place where you get this stuff all settled before you're even shooting,
1220000	1224000	because ideally-I hate-yeah, but it does not happen all the time.
1224000	1226000	Every year it's like the first day of school.
1226000	1231000	You're like, here's my math notebook and my Trapper Keeper and the unicorn's going to hold the pencils
1231000	1238000	and here's my three shirts I'm going to wear, and then two days later it's bubblegum unfolding with the thing.
1239000	1245000	I have so many Doogie Howser journals, either in real writing-there are just like five strong days,
1245000	1250000	and then I forget it and go on a trip, and it's like, well, I'll net and fuck that up.
1250000	1257000	The one that was like a little tiny one like this was like, write something for five years.
1257000	1260000	I got it as a Christmas gift, so New Year's, all right, great.
1260000	1263000	Literally two days, went on a trip, and now it's done.
1263000	1266000	It's like I won't even pick up on it, because it's like, no, if I can't do the five years straight,
1266000	1269000	I'm only five months into it, six months into it.
1269000	1272000	I'm like, no, it's dead to me. Sorry, I blew it.
1272000	1274000	You squandered potential.
1274000	1281000	When you got from-I was with you, I was there in Las Vegas the night-we happened to be in Las Vegas.
1281000	1283000	You were in Second City, Las Vegas.
1283000	1292000	You had been bumped up to the minors from Comedy Sports to like you were doing-there was like 30 people in the audience in this club in Las Vegas.
1292000	1304000	And it was a funny improv show, but you were kind of beaming and trying to keep your Don Draper vibe, you know, because you're such a hipster.
1304000	1312000	But then quickly, we were told that the scout from SNL had been there that week or maybe that day.
1312000	1316000	Oh, I don't remember. I can't-I don't remember the exact timeline, but I mean, that's where-yeah, that's where-
1316000	1320000	It was the night that it was like official, I think, that you were going to be on SNL.
1321000	1324000	Then that would have been-had I already auditioned for it? Do you remember?
1324000	1327000	I think they just came and scouted you. I don't know if you had auditioned.
1327000	1328000	The only thing they had scouted-
1328000	1329000	Maybe that's what it is. Maybe you got the auditioned.
1329000	1338000	It was a manager. It was a manager that saw myself and Kate Cannon, who I was in the cast with, and then a guy named Seamus McCarthy.
1338000	1343000	And that manager picked us all up, and then we made-the guys made tapes because they were looking for guys, I think.
1344000	1348000	Or at least I made a tape. I just filmed the show, basically, and then sent it in.
1348000	1351000	And so I knew maybe I was going to get to go audition, I would assume, maybe at that point.
1351000	1358000	But they offered you a deal, as I recall, that had been-there was a template for it in the past that was like, you know-
1358000	1359000	Or getting hired as a writer.
1359000	1360000	Yeah.
1360000	1366000	Yeah, yeah. So I went to go audition for the show and then didn't get it, but they liked me.
1366000	1369000	And then I got-a week later, they were like, hey, why don't you come out again?
1370000	1374000	And this is when you meet Lauren Michaels, and it's sort of like, he's just making sure you're not crazy.
1374000	1379000	Or like, I think he just said, like, he wants to make sure you're someone that if you walked by in the hallway at 2 a.m., he wouldn't be scared or worried.
1379000	1382000	It was just like, it makes sense. It's his gig.
1382000	1384000	What do you think started that rule?
1384000	1386000	Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
1386000	1389000	Like, who do you think made that happen?
1389000	1393000	Either it was someone or else it was a part of him that he didn't want to deal with, you know what I mean?
1393000	1395000	I mean, you know, it was Tim Meadows.
1395000	1396000	It was Tim Meadows.
1396000	1400000	It was Tim Meadows. He says, a hot, just a loose cannon.
1400000	1403000	I was going to say loose gun, hot cannon.
1403000	1405000	I don't mind going.
1405000	1413000	But we, yeah, so then I got hired as a writer, which I was a little bit like, oh, I was like, oh, nuts.
1413000	1421000	Which is ridiculous. But I had never, I didn't send in a packet. I had imposter syndrome, all that stuff, once getting it.
1421000	1426000	And then you just kind of like just say yes and then hope to God it all works out.
1426000	1428000	And it paid off. You kind of knew that.
1428000	1431000	They were kind of grooming you a bit for being on the cast, right?
1431000	1437000	Yeah. And that was what you're talking about. At that point, there was like, there was like, Tina had done it and David Spade had done it and Sandler had done it.
1437000	1442000	And like even back in the day, Chevy did it kind of, you know, to a degree. Who else? There's like everybody.
1442000	1443000	Robert Schneider?
1443000	1450000	Yeah. Everybody that had done it in the past, you know, that been a writer and was a cast member, had all made that.
1450000	1452000	You sort of knew who they were.
1452000	1454000	Well, they never tell you about Gorby Phillips.
1454000	1456000	Yeah, never yet. Gorby doesn't get his love.
1456000	1460000	He's the guy who wanted to be an actor. They gave him a job as a writer and he's still there.
1460000	1461000	Oh.
1461000	1463000	His office is in the basement.
1463000	1469000	Horrible writer. Hilarious in the room. Hilarious in the room. You love him in the room. You love him in there.
1469000	1476000	I remember Jason, like after the first season or two of when you were in the cast, you come back to L.A.
1476000	1482000	We'd go have a drink and you would just sit down and just dump like how difficult that job was.
1482000	1484000	It seemed like it was like a matter of...
1484000	1488000	But always making sure he was very thankful and said everyone was very wonderful.
1488000	1490000	Jeff, it's like Israel over there.
1492000	1494000	By design. By design.
1494000	1495000	You know.
1495000	1500000	But also like our friend, like Andy Samber, like every time I saw him, he seemed to have aged about 10 years.
1500000	1502000	Oh, it's like the presidency in that way. Yeah.
1503000	1510000	Until you sort of like develop like a niche, I think, or with this guy to my left.
1510000	1516000	Such an original sort of voice that Lauren's like, oh, this is a variety show. I need to have what Will does on there.
1516000	1520000	Or like the Lonely Island guys. I need to have the Lonely Island generation, you know, like Kristen.
1520000	1523000	I need to have a Kristen track on those greatest hits.
1523000	1524000	Right.
1524000	1530000	I talked to somebody about how Lauren's always been... That's always been his real secret underneath it all.
1530000	1535000	I think because it was back when Channel 101 was starting to be a thing and the Lonely Island guys were doing Channel 101.
1535000	1538000	And then all of a sudden, oh, my God, they're taking that different path.
1538000	1544000	That shiller, real Mr. Bill path to SNL, which is...
1544000	1551000	And somebody was talking to me about it and they said, oh, no, but Lauren's a genius, like about that in particular.
1551000	1565000	That he always recognized that the potential obsolescence of what he was doing there and how any one of these random asteroids or geniuses...
1565000	1575000	He had this way of like he would beckon you in and say, look, I know what you want and I know what you deserve and I'm going to set you up so that you can have it.
1576000	1580000	The Lonely Island were getting their card that said it's an SNL digital short.
1580000	1581000	That's their property.
1581000	1583000	He knew that about Smigel.
1583000	1589000	He understood that you can't create an army of generals.
1589000	1594000	You have to give them... You have to let them have the illusion that they have their own world.
1594000	1595000	Yeah, I know it's true.
1595000	1597000	I would say that he is good at that.
1597000	1598000	You have to earn that, though.
1598000	1608000	Will and Jason, how far along when you were a cast member, was it when you found, okay, this is my niche, this is my thing.
1608000	1609000	Did that take a while?
1609000	1613000	I remember at one point you guys were just my favorite.
1613000	1614000	That cast was really good.
1614000	1624000	And you two together, especially, because I went to one of the tapings and you guys doing that, you're a mustached ESPN3 kind of character.
1624000	1626000	Fucking hilarious.
1626000	1633000	Did it take a while to find your stride and find when you go, okay, this is my shit, this is what I do?
1633000	1643000	I mean, it depends for everybody because I would always kind of do weirder stuff and it's hard to get that stuff on.
1643000	1648000	So you have to kind of build up this trust and I was...
1648000	1650000	It would kill on Wednesday's PS.
1650000	1656000	The read-through, every time you see it, because at the top of every script, it's the writers' names.
1656000	1658000	So you'd see Faye and Poehler.
1658000	1661000	Or if it said Forte, you were just kind of like...
1661000	1665000	Even if you'd been there five hours, you're like, all right, here we go.
1665000	1667000	I mean, it's the truth.
1667000	1679000	And especially when you were writing with Sloven and Allen, there was this ironing, sharpening iron thing that was brewing there that I don't think really kicked in to Jeff's question until maybe our group came in.
1679000	1686000	Because I felt like just watching it from the outside, your stuff started to get that play after you stopped playing Bush, really.
1686000	1688000	Oh, for sure.
1688000	1696000	It was an honor to play Bush, but it was an honor I did not want.
1696000	1698000	Then I ended up playing it.
1698000	1700000	Will Ferrell had just done it.
1700000	1701000	It's like, what are we doing?
1701000	1706000	To me, it's like Dana Carvey doing The Church Lady.
1706000	1712000	Will Ferrell had turned Bush into a character that was so synonymous with him.
1712000	1713000	Flat out won in the election.
1713000	1714000	Won in the election.
1714000	1718000	Ruined our country for eight years by his talent, his charm.
1718000	1725000	You can't have Dana Carvey would not leave and then somebody else come in and do The Church Lady, but you have to do the president.
1725000	1729000	So I somehow became that guy, and I was shitty at it.
1729000	1730000	That's not true.
1730000	1734000	At the beginning, when he was all whiny, you were great at it because you were like, oh, man.
1734000	1736000	And then he changed.
1736000	1739000	It certainly was not the kind of stuff I like to do.
1739000	1750000	It was a fun adventure, but the cast was so big at the time that a lot of times I would be putting out the kind of stuff that I liked.
1750000	1758000	But you got to service everybody, so I would get these Bush things that were in there that weren't necessarily my thing.
1758000	1761000	And that would be the thing for that episode.
1761000	1765000	So like for a couple of years, I was just kind of the Bush guy and didn't really get to do.
1765000	1766000	But there was also this.
1766000	1772000	I don't remember who told me about this, but then I started looking for it that in those years there was closer to midnight.
1772000	1778000	It was like, OK, these like I always try to figure out the formula with the last sketch on SNL.
1778000	1781000	It was like sometimes it was clearly just the shittiest.
1781000	1786000	So sometimes it was one that like I don't I have no idea.
1786000	1792000	You guys could tell me and maybe for political reasons you wouldn't even be able to or it would take too long or there is no formula.
1792000	1794000	But but then somebody told me like watch that.
1794000	1804000	But sometimes it's like these like weird pieces of esoteric brilliance, these like just just good, good quality sketches that were.
1804000	1807000	And it was Forte's name that was like like attached to that.
1807000	1815000	It would go like, oh, that's a there's something you got to watch till midnight because you might there might be a Forte sketch coming because they're putting them there.
1815000	1819000	Not because they don't believe in them, but because like the spelling like a hint.
1819000	1826000	Yeah, like it wasn't that that was what I was going to say was the episode that where I felt like it all kicked in.
1826000	1833000	That was Jack Black hosting the Christmas episode of what happened to be oddly enough my generation's first season.
1833000	1834000	I was lucky to be there.
1834000	1835000	I was there. You were there.
1835000	1841000	You were there. So you had you had you had Jack Black kicking ass his second time hosting singing an amazing King Kong opener.
1841000	1848000	Then you have then you have there was the wig and I the first a holes to a holes by a Christmas tree.
1848000	1850000	You had Christmas time for the Jews.
1850000	1855000	A short thing of a short, amazing short film parody by Smigel.
1855000	1858000	You had Spelling Bee with with with Forte.
1858000	1863000	And then most importantly, I would say most iconically Lazy Sunday by Lonely Island.
1863000	1865000	That was just like one episode.
1865000	1866000	Give me goosebumps.
1866000	1868000	One season one episode.
1868000	1870000	That was really Christmas episode of two thousand.
1870000	1874000	So that must be why I was watching it because like my friends were like, oh my God, they had just gone up.
1874000	1880000	I was at the party where they and Bill Hader was also alongside them was like being sent up in a balloon to New York.
1880000	1881000	Absolutely.
1881000	1883000	Bye guys.
1883000	1892000	And so I must have been watching that night going, oh, this is the first or maybe Sunday because they had done stuff before that and Lazy Sunday was kind of their whatever.
1892000	1893000	Yeah.
1893000	1896000	But but the Spelling Bee thing, I just want to talk about for a second.
1896000	1902000	The sketch, the Spelling Bee sketch, I'm sure if you just type it into YouTube, who knows, or somebody just find it.
1902000	1909000	It's simply judges at a Spelling Bee saying, all right, your next word is what's the next word?
1909000	1910000	Business.
1910000	1911000	Business.
1911000	1919000	And then the entire sketch from front to back is Will Forte incorrectly spelling business.
1919000	1920000	And that's it.
1920000	1922000	That's the whole sketch.
1922000	1923000	It doesn't.
1923000	1926000	He doesn't finish like, you know, and then they go, oh, that's not quite right.
1926000	1928000	Why don't you try a simpler word like cat?
1928000	1929000	And then he does it three times.
1929000	1932000	And then in the end, he spells a really complicated word really well.
1932000	1933000	And then you're done.
1933000	1936000	The entire sketch is him failing to spell the word business.
1936000	1938000	And it's not a short sketch.
1938000	1941000	It's it's it's cone head size.
1941000	1943000	It's it's it's a proper size.
1943000	1944000	A hungry man.
1944000	1945000	Jack sketch size.
1945000	1949000	But the whole meal is him just different letters.
1949000	1953000	Q. Q. Q. How many times do you say Q?
1953000	1959000	Would you do numbers at one point like adding numbers into it?
1959000	1961000	That was that was a hard one to get on.
1961000	1962000	Yeah.
1962000	1965000	I had done it at the groundlings a bunch of times.
1965000	1966000	Killing it.
1966000	1967000	Killing it at the groundlings.
1967000	1968000	It always would go very well at the groundlings.
1968000	1969000	But you did it.
1969000	1970000	You did it at SNL.
1970000	1971000	It wouldn't get picked.
1971000	1974000	You would do it at like Smigel would have you do Night of Too Many Stars.
1974000	1976000	You'd play like Radio City Music Hall and do it.
1976000	1977000	It would crush.
1977000	1978000	And then they would put it at the table or wherever you guys were doing.
1978000	1981000	Wherever you guys were doing those where he would ask you to do it at a benefit.
1981000	1982000	It would crush.
1982000	1986000	They'd bring it back to like you know 17th floor like you know 50 people watching.
1986000	1988000	Everybody's just like it's killing.
1988000	1990000	But everybody's like it's never going to get on.
1990000	1991000	And it wasn't.
1991000	1992000	Well I got a hand.
1992000	1999000	Like Jack Black was the one who really pushed it forward because he you know he's he is great.
1999000	2004000	And he's such a champion of comedy and just really like it.
2004000	2005000	If it wasn't for him.
2005000	2006000	Yeah.
2006000	2008000	If it wasn't for him it wouldn't have gotten on.
2008000	2009000	So.
2009000	2013000	When you write when you wrote a really weird sketch that was kind of esoteric and strange
2013000	2017000	and you go into that read through what everybody's you know you've got the piles of paper.
2017000	2021000	All the all the scripts that are just you're reading through everything.
2021000	2024000	You have to get up and really perform that like at the table.
2024000	2026000	Like you really have to sell that to the room.
2026000	2027000	Right.
2027000	2028000	Oh yeah.
2028000	2031000	I mean most of the time you're just sitting down every every once in a while.
2031000	2033000	There's something with a little more action.
2033000	2035000	You might stand up and do some of this stuff.
2035000	2037000	You know you you do a pretty full out.
2037000	2040000	You do something that maybe no one thinks that I.
2040000	2042000	What does the writers room look like.
2042000	2043000	When you're at SNL.
2043000	2044000	It's like an office.
2044000	2046000	It's like a like a conference room.
2046000	2047000	Like a vibe.
2047000	2049000	It's like it's almost like a big table.
2049000	2050000	Everyone sitting on it.
2050000	2052000	Big tables on the outer walls.
2052000	2055000	Everybody sitting around the table is all the cast and depending on how many there are.
2055000	2057000	Like right now there's probably not much elbow room.
2057000	2060000	It got to a point when we were there that there was like a nice amount of room.
2060000	2062000	So the cast is around the table and then there's the head.
2062000	2065000	The head of the table is Lauren and the host.
2065000	2069000	And then cast cast cast cast cast cast cast cast then are around this side.
2069000	2076000	Like if you were looking down at three o'clock is like Seth and one of the assistant directors Janine who times every sketch.
2076000	2078000	One of the producers Steve Higgins.
2078000	2080000	Somebody else.
2080000	2083000	But then around the sides are like the department heads.
2083000	2087000	All the writers are like at nine o'clock behind here like four rows deep.
2087000	2090000	People are sometimes sleeping because they've been up since.
2091000	2093000	So this is a room where there's a table.
2093000	2096000	You're describing this is a table read.
2096000	2097000	Table read.
2097000	2098000	Yes.
2098000	2105000	What about just the room in which people are pitching sketches.
2105000	2108000	It mostly happens in offices.
2108000	2113000	It's like a normal office building with just a more open FART policy.
2113000	2115000	It looks like 30 Rock.
2115000	2118000	I mean it looks like that's I mean you know like the TV show.
2118000	2119000	You're a writer.
2119000	2123000	And are you sitting like like when you think.
2123000	2128000	Are you sitting cross legged on a carpeted floor with a with a sheaf of papers in front of you.
2128000	2131000	Notes scribbled on them waiting your turn to pitch something.
2131000	2132000	Yes.
2132000	2133000	On Mondays with the host.
2133000	2134000	There's the host meeting the pitch meeting.
2134000	2135000	You go.
2135000	2136000	Everybody lines up.
2136000	2137000	We all sit in Lauren's office.
2137000	2139000	Some people on chairs like humans.
2139000	2140000	Other people on the ground.
2140000	2141000	Have you told it.
2141000	2143000	Have you told it too many times on too many shows.
2143000	2144000	But your Snoop Dogg story.
2144000	2146000	Would that be a pain to retell.
2146000	2148000	I retell your Snoop Dogg story when you were a writer.
2148000	2149000	Yeah.
2149000	2150000	You know I remember.
2150000	2151000	Yeah.
2151000	2152000	The.
2152000	2153000	No I mean I could I mean I don't mind telling it.
2153000	2155000	It's a good life philosophy.
2155000	2157000	But you know.
2157000	2158000	We're on Tuesday nights.
2158000	2161000	The host goes around wherever it is and they meet with the different writers.
2161000	2164000	And this was it was actually I think it was your office at the time.
2164000	2165000	You were rooming with Tellerico.
2165000	2166000	There's Tellerico at that point.
2166000	2167000	Yeah.
2167000	2170000	And it was me and Rich Tellerico.
2170000	2174000	And I think you might have maybe been in there if not pitching ideas to Snoop.
2174000	2178000	I just love Rich's ideas so much that I always feel obligated to put them in here.
2178000	2179000	He's tell Snoop.
2179000	2180000	Snoop just sitting there like this.
2180000	2182000	And he's like I have this idea where you play a dad.
2182000	2186000	But you know that scene like at the dinner table when the kid mouths off and he takes off the belt.
2186000	2187000	You don't take off your belt.
2187000	2194000	Your job is you make a living as a beekeeper so you slowly start to put on your beekeeper outfit.
2194000	2197000	To intimidate your kids.
2197000	2199000	And I swear to God Snoop's like.
2199000	2200000	Like yeah.
2200000	2201000	Yeah.
2201000	2202000	I like that.
2202000	2203000	I like that.
2203000	2204000	Yeah.
2204000	2209000	I want this guy to be real scientific about the bees.
2209000	2211000	You know what I mean?
2211000	2214000	Like I want him to know what's going on inside of a bee's mind.
2214000	2215000	Literally.
2215000	2216000	He's saying that.
2216000	2217000	Other things.
2217000	2218000	Blah blah blah.
2218000	2219000	We're playing music.
2219000	2220000	We're playing music.
2220000	2221000	Rich is.
2221000	2222000	He's got these speakers in there.
2222000	2224000	And he's blaring like Snoop Dogg hits.
2224000	2225000	And he's like yeah.
2225000	2228000	See I put a cover on every album because you got to look backward before you look forward.
2228000	2229000	Like he would just talk like this.
2229000	2230000	He would just say.
2230000	2231000	Yeah.
2231000	2232000	Yeah man.
2232000	2235000	Like Urban Outfitters I was always said to just follow him around with a pad and pen.
2235000	2237000	Be like we're making pillows t-shirts.
2237000	2238000	This is like.
2238000	2240000	This fucking guy.
2240000	2242000	Unbelievable.
2242000	2244000	And then at the end Rich.
2244000	2246000	And you know I mean I was just observing this.
2246000	2248000	Rich is really the point guard of this entire narrative.
2248000	2251000	But Rich goes Snoop after the party on Saturday.
2251000	2253000	We got a we got a kick in.
2253000	2254000	Snoop says.
2254000	2255000	I swear to God for shizzle.
2255000	2256000	He says because this is at the height.
2256000	2257000	For shizzle.
2257000	2258000	And he goes.
2258000	2259000	And Rich for whatever reason goes.
2259000	2260000	Maybe we'll get.
2260000	2261000	Maybe we'll get a.
2261000	2262000	We'll get a hoe.
2262000	2263000	And.
2263000	2266000	And Snoop just goes.
2266000	2268000	Why can only one hoe.
2268000	2270000	Right.
2270000	2271000	He could have.
2271000	2273000	He could have stopped there.
2273000	2274000	He could have stopped there.
2274000	2275000	Let me draw my own conclusion.
2275000	2276000	Let us all sort of be like.
2276000	2277000	What does he mean by that.
2277000	2278000	You know like.
2278000	2279000	But he don't.
2279000	2280000	He goes on.
2280000	2281000	He goes.
2281000	2287000	Don't put limits on your life.
2287000	2288000	Again you're kind of like.
2288000	2289000	That's it.
2289000	2291000	He could get up and leave now.
2291000	2294000	The Urban Outfitters person could close their moleskin and be like.
2294000	2295000	OK.
2295000	2296000	We got next week's shirt.
2296000	2297000	We're good.
2297000	2298000	He goes.
2298000	2299000	Why get only one hoe.
2299000	2300000	Why not get.
2300000	2301000	Why not get two or three.
2301000	2302000	I'm sorry.
2302000	2303000	Don't put limits on your life.
2303000	2304000	And then he says.
2304000	2305000	Dream big.
2305000	2306000	Dream big.
2306000	2307000	You may never wake up.
2307000	2312000	I don't know if he said it since.
2312000	2314000	I don't know if he remembers saying it.
2314000	2315000	Did you.
2315000	2316000	Did you run and write it down because.
2316000	2317000	No.
2317000	2318000	There's so many.
2318000	2319000	Like a good joke.
2319000	2320000	I've just told it so many times.
2320000	2321000	Like because.
2321000	2322000	I remember you telling me that.
2322000	2323000	And we're like.
2323000	2324000	That's your Leno story.
2324000	2325000	I think you told it on Leno.
2325000	2326000	I told it on Conan.
2326000	2327000	The first.
2327000	2328000	The first like talk show I did.
2328000	2329000	You.
2329000	2330000	You're like.
2330000	2331000	Oh I have my Conan story.
2331000	2332000	Yeah.
2332000	2333000	Yeah.
2333000	2334000	He's given me this.
2334000	2335000	Like I got this.
2335000	2336000	You know.
2336000	2337000	So what.
2337000	2338000	Is this a religious question.
2338000	2339000	You guys are writer.
2339000	2340000	It does God exist.
2340000	2341000	The.
2341000	2342000	The.
2342000	2346000	And what do you like Jewish people.
2346000	2347000	The.
2347000	2348000	So.
2348000	2349000	It's.
2349000	2350000	The.
2350000	2351000	I made the Israel comment earlier.
2351000	2352000	Now I have to counterbalance that.
2352000	2353000	I got to remember some anti Christian shit.
2353000	2354000	I don't know.
2354000	2355000	It's out there.
2355000	2356000	That's that war is still happening right.
2356000	2357000	Jews versus Christians.
2357000	2358000	Yeah.
2358000	2360000	I don't want to get mixed up in that.
2360000	2364000	What.
2364000	2365000	You guys are both writers.
2365000	2367000	You're both performers.
2367000	2368000	You.
2368000	2369000	You.
2369000	2370000	You.
2370000	2371000	Forte.
2371000	2372000	You were.

2373000	2374000	Yeah.
2374000	2375000	Right.
2375000	2376000	Yeah.
2376000	2377000	You were in the.
2377000	2378000	Wait till he gets to the end of it.
2378000	2379000	It's.
2379000	2381000	You helped him write this one.
2381000	2382000	Yeah.
2382000	2383000	Yeah.
2383000	2384000	Yeah.
2384000	2385000	Working all day on this question.
2385000	2386000	We have a mutual friend Jim rash.
2386000	2387000	You were in groundlings with him.
2387000	2388000	Right.
2388000	2389000	That was your class.
2389000	2390000	Like like he's a writer director.
2390000	2392000	He's Oscar winning writer and director.
2392000	2398000	I think he is directing and the actor writer and actor.
2398000	2402000	Writer actors are better actors than regular actors.
2402000	2404000	And don't don't comment on that.
2404000	2408000	Because I'm sure I'm sure you have actor friends.
2408000	2415000	But what I want to ask is like what are you more.
2415000	2416000	I don't know.
2416000	2420000	You know the question is what are you more.
2420000	2422000	Do you think of yourself when you're standing on set as an
2422000	2426000	actor like OK I'm doing this acting job but I'm a writer or is
2426000	2427000	it the other way around.
2427000	2431000	Well I started off as a writer so I think I'll always think of
2431000	2433000	myself as more of a writer.
2433000	2436000	At the end of my third year.
2436000	2438000	You wrote before you did groundlings?
2438000	2439000	Yeah.
2439000	2440000	Well.
2440000	2441000	I did.
2441000	2442000	I did go through your.
2442000	2443000	Yeah.
2443000	2444000	I was.
2444000	2445000	I was.
2445000	2446000	I didn't.
2446000	2447000	I wasn't writing professionally.
2447000	2448000	We could go through your past for a second here because it's
2448000	2449000	kind of interesting.
2449000	2450000	I bothered to Wikipedia you.
2450000	2451000	It's crazy.
2451000	2454000	When I heard you might be coming by and the most notable thing
2454000	2461000	first is your name is your given name is Orville Wilbert.
2461000	2462000	Orville Willis.
2462000	2463000	Or the fourth.
2463000	2464000	Yes.
2464000	2466000	I've never met a fourth before.
2466000	2469000	I know it's you know.
2469000	2471000	Are you making fun of his name.
2471000	2473000	No I'm making fun of America.
2473000	2476000	We've never had a fourth generation of anything here.
2476000	2480000	Everything around you is 20 years old architecturally.
2480000	2481000	That's made of rock.
2481000	2485000	Like this is a flesh thing made of four four strings of dude.
2485000	2488000	That's that's European man.
2488000	2489000	That's heavy shit.
2489000	2491000	We've got our episode title.
2491000	2497000	We have a titular moment.
2497000	2499000	We have had our moment.
2499000	2504000	I will say there was there was when I first I wrote on sitcoms
2504000	2505000	for a while.
2505000	2509000	I wrote it Letterman wrote it Third Rock from the Sun 70
2509000	2515000	show then got the SNL job and there it I definitely was had
2515000	2519000	more of a writer's mentality because I would be I'd go in and
2519000	2524000	when I would act my own stuff I would I would stuff that I
2524000	2528000	had written I would feel very confident I'd know exactly what
2528000	2531000	to do and I would get into my head with because I had to
2531000	2535000	remember if I would write stuff and you know sitting back
2535000	2537000	there as other people would do it and just going.
2537000	2538000	OK.
2538000	2539000	Do it.
2539000	2541000	I wanted it.
2541000	2544000	You know and so in my head as I was doing other people's
2544000	2548000	things I would just be thinking about how upset they were
2548000	2549000	about the choices I was making.
2549000	2554000	So at the end of the third season at SNL over the summer
2554000	2558000	there there was this really the cast was very big.
2558000	2562000	Lauren was thinking about making changes and and there's a date
2562000	2565000	in July when you're supposed to be told whether your option is
2565000	2569000	picked up and they had Independence Day.
2569000	2570000	Yeah.
2570000	2575000	And and they held off on picking up my option and it took an
2575000	2578000	extension and for like six weeks I had to wait.
2578000	2582000	And the final conversation I had with him was what he said.
2582000	2586000	You know you are thinking too much like a writer.
2586000	2587000	You need to own it a little more.
2587000	2592000	And of course I'm like oh fuck this old man he has no idea.
2592000	2593000	I love this character.
2593000	2596000	But I come back and and the more I thought about it he was
2596000	2597000	absolutely right.
2597000	2600000	I was just like I would be too nervous about performing in
2600000	2601000	other people's things.
2601000	2605000	And so once I he just you know he gave me the best advice of
2605000	2608000	all time which was just to go in there and and make the
2608000	2611000	characters your own in other people's rings and we'll just
2611000	2612000	let her rip.
2612000	2613000	Yeah.
2613000	2617000	And thank God he let me come back and that really was like
2617000	2620000	you know knowing that I had almost fired it all felt like
2620000	2622000	gravy and then it was just like OK fuck it.
2622000	2626000	He's like look if these writers knew better than actors they'd
2626000	2630000	be actors like they they're so smart but they can't act like
2630000	2633000	you could come in take their stuff and take it to the take
2633000	2634000	it to the end zone where.
2634000	2635000	Yeah.
2635000	2636000	And your experience had been as a writer.
2636000	2639000	I would sometimes get their stuff down to like the twenty
2639000	2640000	five.
2640000	2641000	Yeah.
2641000	2644000	And but suds you're probably a little more complicated right
2644000	2647000	because you're not quite as I mean he was a writer forever and
2647000	2649000	you're like you're you're you were an improviser which is
2649000	2650000	half and half already.
2650000	2651000	You're like a golden doodle.
2651000	2652000	Right.
2652000	2659000	But but you're also we call Jason suds.
2659000	2660000	Yes.
2660000	2661000	All right.
2661000	2665000	But your your your passion was for performing originally I
2665000	2666000	mean.
2666000	2668000	And so and then they're saying to you well yeah but you're a
2668000	2669000	writer right.
2669000	2670000	And they're putting you in the writer's room.
2670000	2674000	So when you're out when you're in front of a camera or on a
2674000	2677000	pink and sea foam poster with three starlets and then your
2677000	2682000	face part of my face they put they added some stuff to my
2682000	2683000	face eyebrows.
2683000	2684000	Yeah.
2684000	2685000	Yeah.
2685000	2686000	But I know you mean when you're when you're studying it up in
2686000	2688000	front of the eye over the shoulder.
2688000	2691000	Your beard your beard and the Mother's Day poster is really
2691000	2692000	great.
2692000	2693000	Yeah.
2693000	2694000	It's really.
2694000	2695000	Yeah.
2695000	2696000	Like it's like Drake density.
2696000	2699000	It's like it's like a healthy healthy bit my eyebrows like
2699000	2703000	when I look at I go I wish I told you where I'd be if I look
2703000	2704000	like that.
2704000	2707000	It's like a little kid's hobo costume.
2707000	2709000	Like they're stippling involved.
2709000	2712000	I texted Jason a like a picture of that poster.
2712000	2714000	I said please I don't know what this movie is about.
2714000	2717000	Please tell me that you're a high price male hustler.
2718000	2719000	Yeah.
2719000	2721000	And your eyebrows have their own beards.
2721000	2726000	Like it's you're you're you're made of beards in that.
2726000	2727000	Yeah.
2727000	2728000	Yeah.
2728000	2729000	No it's it's it.
2729000	2730000	I am.
2730000	2731000	I'm with you when I saw it.
2731000	2732000	I was just like yeah.
2732000	2733000	I mean it was so great.
2733000	2734000	Sorry.
2734000	2735000	Sorry.
2735000	2738000	You an actor that had that has used your extra ability to
2738000	2739000	write to.
2739000	2740000	Yeah.
2740000	2741000	I think so.
2741000	2742000	I would say I would say so.
2742000	2743000	I do.
2743000	2746000	I mean I there's there's such for me like with acting like
2746000	2747000	who cares.
2747000	2750000	But like since you're asking about it like of like the left
2750000	2751000	brain right brain.
2751000	2754000	Like I think I'm envious of actors that can really just like
2754000	2755000	just like be in it.
2755000	2758000	I feel like I can get there because but my left brain is
2758000	2761000	always working the part of you that has to hit a mark the part
2761000	2763000	of you that has to like know where the light is and all that
2763000	2765000	kind of stuff especially tracking shots all that stuff I can
2765000	2766000	handle really well.
2766000	2768000	And I think that comes from like playing basketball as a kid
2768000	2771000	like running plays and stuff like it's like it's a sports
2771000	2774000	sports come back around to haunt me.
2774000	2777000	But I think it could have happened with like any any sort
2777000	2778000	of group mentality.
2778000	2781000	I just didn't have like you know the other group of kids that
2781000	2783000	in my neighborhood they played sports they didn't put on
2783000	2784000	plays.
2784000	2786000	You know I mean I don't mean as a smart ass because I know
2786000	2788000	there are neighborhoods like that and I was lucky to meet
2788000	2789000	those kind of kids in high school.
2789000	2794000	But like so I'm like always cognizant of like what's what
2794000	2798000	is needed to happen to make it like like at least not have to
2798000	2802000	cut because of some mal like physical malfunction you know
2802000	2803000	like.
2803000	2805000	That brings up an interesting question for Tate.
2805000	2809000	You're writing for yourself and that means to a powerful
2809000	2811000	degree you're blocking yourself.
2811000	2813000	Like a director could come in and say no I think you should
2813000	2814000	be in the doorway.
2814000	2815000	Sorry I burped it's gross.
2815000	2817000	You I think you should be in the doorway and then you should
2817000	2819000	you should do a somersault and sometimes directors have great
2819000	2823000	ideas and sometimes they're just directors that the you first
2823000	2826000	and foremost if you're writing a scene.
2826000	2834000	It's how you respond to that sentence that says more about
2834000	2835000	anything.
2835000	2836000	You know what I mean.
2836000	2838000	I'm sure it was very visual whatever was going on down
2838000	2839000	there.
2839000	2841000	But it doesn't tell a story at the end of the day.
2841000	2842000	And Rob's mind.
2842000	2843000	We need both.
2843000	2844000	We need both.
2844000	2849000	Rob is drawing a storyboard of him killing you right now.
2849000	2855000	No but sewing a bird's eye I've taken the shit on his car.
2855000	2857000	Oh God I wish directors didn't prioritize.
2857000	2860000	You're doing a shot list of peeing in your drink.
2860000	2868000	You have a specific brain.
2868000	2871000	I mean you're like are you secure.
2871000	2874000	Here you're this guy that's going like you're kind of like
2874000	2876000	I want this joke to land etcetera etcetera.
2876000	2878000	I won't repeat the process that you took us through.
2878000	2880000	But then you're on a laptop so you're writing that a character
2880000	2884000	that's going to be played by you and you I guess the small part
2884000	2888000	of my question is like do you do things like mitigate your
2888000	2889000	blocking in the scene.
2889000	2891000	Do you go like look I don't want to do a bunch of complicated
2891000	2894000	shit in this scene because I'm going to start.
2894000	2897000	I'm only going to be funny if I'm able to sit still and like
2897000	2901000	remember my lines or are you like no I need to occupy myself
2901000	2902000	anything like that.
2902000	2906000	Like do you knowing yourself as a performer when you're
2906000	2908000	writing do you write specific things for yourself.
2908000	2911000	Certainly you will write to your strengths but every once in
2912000	2914000	while there will be things that bring you outside your
2914000	2918000	comfort zone if you get together together with the writers and
2918000	2921000	they all think it's a great idea and you think all right let's
2921000	2922000	fucking go for it.
2922000	2926000	You know it's it really is but for the most part you can you
2926000	2929000	can really you'll know the stuff you're good at and not very
2929000	2933000	good at and you kind of stick with the stuff you're good at.
2933000	2936000	I think all that stuff literally comes down to like trust of
2936000	2939000	you know like literally like where I'm going to be.
2939000	2942000	I'll ask I'll be asked to do this like me staying in my head
2942000	2945000	I don't think is necessarily healthy like all the time as
2945000	2948000	even though I feel connected more as a actor than a writer
2948000	2950000	the part of me that doesn't let me get out of my head is
2950000	2953000	probably not giving the person directing me the majority of
2953000	2956000	the time enough trust to just be out of my own head to maybe
2956000	2959000	have an assessment of it but I don't in the middle of a scene
2959000	2962000	it's only like when looking at the sides or thinking about
2962000	2965000	it if they suggest something I'll be like oh no so I think
2965000	2967000	like with stuff you would have stuff in your head in scenes
2967000	2969000	that we would do and then we would sort of talk about stuff
2969000	2972000	and maybe you would feel you're always very accommodating
2972000	2974000	it's not like you're rigid and like I wrote it this way so
2974000	2975000	it has to be this way.
2975000	2979000	Oh yeah and if there's ever a director that wants to try
2979000	2982000	something that's different than what I was thinking it's
2982000	2986000	always somebody like Jason Walner who knows his shit and
2986000	2990000	John Solomon our you know best buddy and you know these
2990000	2993000	wonderful people who are super smart and you know
2993000	2997000	throw a bone to Rob Schwab for you know just for her.
2997000	2998000	Yeah get him in there.
2998000	3000000	Schwab Schwab I'm sure is great.
3000000	3002000	Yeah like yeah.
3002000	3005000	Thank you.
3005000	3009000	Yeah no I've always I've never well I've had what you've
3009000	3012000	had which is like you write something you hear it a certain
3012000	3014000	way in your head and it would be great if they did it exactly
3014000	3017000	that way sometimes it's right in the bubble you're trying to
3017000	3020000	figure out do I just want to hear this the way it was in
3020000	3023000	my head am I objectively hearing it like so I can decide
3023000	3030000	actually oh that's that's no then there's the then there's
3030000	3032000	the getting past that there's the oh someone please help me
3032000	3035000	with this and if a director can think of a better blocking
3035000	3038000	and sometimes you know like like like Heath Collins on
3038000	3042000	Great Minds will like like like I'll have a very basic thing
3042000	3045000	in my head and then he'll go yeah but what if what if the
3045000	3048000	person was sitting behind the doorway and then you entered
3048000	3050000	so then we could all get it in one shot like all these
3050000	3053000	different shaped brains and they all overlap and I'm sure
3053000	3064000	Rob's great at something the the I told you he wouldn't have
3064000	3069000	fun I just remembered something that so we finished I think
3069000	3073000	I need a table next time next time I'm on the show oh yeah
3073000	3079000	what are you gonna do with that table nothing I guess maybe
3079000	3084000	you could use it to a distant or a fuck maybe you can use
3084000	3087000	it to stutter and emotionally distance yourself from the
3087000	3093000	people on stage it is it is so weird we bring Spencer out
3093000	3095000	first and he sits in the corner and we never talk to him
3095000	3100000	yeah oh I mean and now you're bringing me out yeah now
3100000	3103000	yeah I was like hey look at the stage for the people who
3103000	3107000	don't talk no and well it's our fault I think you guys were
3107000	3110000	all kicking in before we got out it's all good I just don't

3153000	3157000	right like for the team sure yeah yeah Jason today because
3157000	3159000	this dude can play basketball he's really good well not
3159000	3162000	compared to those guys but compared to everybody probably
3162000	3169000	here I would say I can get rebound but also like you
3169000	3172000	love your high top basketball shoes I do love to the extent
3172000	3174000	that you're we went to your house you got a room you got a
3174000	3177000	whole walk-in closet that's just for your high top
3177000	3180000	basketball shoes which is there's low tops too you got I
3180000	3183000	mean with that much room you got to have low tops too do
3183000	3187000	you have any medium tops three-quarter tops yeah I'm
3187000	3192000	wearing some it's yeah those tops are three quarters you
3192000	3196000	are kidding look at those tops yeah go all the way up so
3196000	3201000	Jason and I and they don't go all the way down either they're
3201000	3205000	kind of like split the difference tops they can't make
3205000	3211000	a choice those tops split the difference between the high
3211000	3222000	and the low those are some Wednesday tops 50% of the
3222000	3230000	tops so Jason and I went to go play basketball and we went
3230000	3235000	to a justifying we went to a basketball court Cosby at the
3235000	3243000	end these are those are some Wednesday tops those are those
3243000	3249000	tops are completely those tops up I'm telling you Camille
3249000	3256000	those tops are halfway up the ankle that's not funny anymore
3256000	3261000	no it's not it is actually it is getting funnier the fact
3261000	3264000	that we're not talking about why it isn't funny it's really
3264000	3271000	funny you know Camille is really funny so Jason and I go
3271000	3274000	play a pickup game in West Hollywood like on San Vicente
3274000	3278000	and I played there before and it's it's pretty intense like
3278000	3281000	pickup basketball game and some of the guys there talk a lot
3281000	3284000	of trash it's a lot like a lot of big mouths and it's usually
3284000	3286000	the guys that aren't that good that are talking the most
3286000	3291000	trash isn't that isn't that just the truth isn't that so I
3291000	3294000	missed my free throw you got to make a free throw to get in
3294000	3297000	the game I missed my free throw Jason gets on a team so I'm
3297000	3300000	just chilling and Jason I think you matched up against one of
3300000	3303000	the biggest loud mouths on the opposing team I usually do
3303000	3308000	and Jason had the funniest shit talk of all time he kept
3308000	3310000	scoring on this dude and every time you come down the court
3310000	3313000	he would say do you know that they call me the electrician
3313000	3318000	he would have a new occupation he'd be driven the bar and
3318000	3321000	the guy hated him so much they call me the electrician
3321000	3324000	he'd shoot it he goes because I'm putting the lights out
3324000	3328000	it was what were the other ones I'm sure the waiter
3328000	3332000	what was the waiter dropping down no no no the waiter was
3332000	3339000	serving up funky dishes there was the plumber
3339000	3346000	clunky cashiers was dropping dimes I like that you can be
3346000	3349000	so good at basketball that you become bad at another job
3349000	3354000	yeah they call me the terrible mailman because I'm not
3354000	3358000	bringing anything to you get out of my diner go play
3358000	3365000	basketball I said get but I remember the other team I'm
3366000	3369000	such a terrible janitor at this diner I should be
3369000	3376000	yeah a lot of people don't sniff that out right
3376000	3379000	what book did what book did he read that made him think he
3379000	3382000	could be Mary Hill Valley but there was a point when you
3382000	3385000	were you were pissing off that guy that even his own
3385000	3388000	teammates were laughing at him because you kept clowning
3388000	3391000	him and it was the greatest I just remembered one thing
3391000	3395000	from the mushroom adventure after my after my hand was
3395000	3398000	laid on the surface of the water and I commuted with all
3398000	3403000	life like Cody was back in the in the in the bungalow like
3403000	3406000	rolling around on the bed because it was soft and I and
3406000	3410000	then I went and we made the mistake of trying all kinds
3410000	3414000	of things and and then but you don't need to know about
3414000	3417000	that or or picture it I kind of want to know I want to
3417000	3419000	know everything about I want to know a little bit about
3419000	3423000	that but there was a point I wrote down the quote like
3423000	3426000	we'll kind of just both individually kind of rolling
3426000	3429000	around because like this for me the ceiling was like a
3429000	3433000	pool and there was like I might fall in it if I close my
3433000	3441000	eyes and then Cody said I want a baby or maybe or maybe
3441000	3447000	I just want a soft bathrobe and she should have the
3447000	3452000	right to make that choice that's right that is a woman's
3452000	3459000	decision all right guys thanks so much it's one of the
3459000	3463000	two though for sure yeah yeah so it's it's that kind of
3463000	3466000	Jason can we talk about this the first time that I ever
3466000	3469000	did it are you okay talking mushrooms yeah yeah what do
3469000	3472000	you mean like like sponsors and stuff yeah like my aa
3472000	3474000	sponsors exactly no I'm proud of it the first time I ever
3474000	3477000	did mushrooms what was your friend's name Mike Mike
3477000	3479000	Mike Lucas and the three of us we did it and we went to
3479000	3481000	your apartment and it was am I correct saying that it was
3481000	3483000	right on the intersection where Tupac was murdered
3483000	3486000	Flamingo and Koval yeah yeah they cleaned it up since then
3486000	3491000	but yeah it was yeah that's where it was so the meridian
3491000	3493000	there was the name of the there was a little ritual that
3493000	3496000	you guys put me through at the beginning we would be like
3496000	3499000	chopped up the stems and the caps and there was some
3499000	3501000	little vehicle like a little choo choo train or a little
3501000	3504000	that was all improvised like that was that was Mike being
3504000	3507000	stoned before I think on mushrooms and just a very like
3507000	3510000	creative guy there's like a little like wheelbarrow or
3510000	3512000	choo choo we created like a little like a little um
3512000	3515000	altar kind of thing ceremonial you had to make a wish and
3515000	3517000	you had to push the choo choo train with the mushrooms
3517000	3520000	yeah I remember that fell over that was good luck or bad
3520000	3523000	luck oh yeah that all makes sense why do we even need
3523000	3529000	these drugs what are we doing we're fine so we're fine do
3530000	3534000	zip zap zap and hit the town so yeah it's free yeah when
3534000	3536000	you're that desperate to have a good time together you
3536000	3542000	probably will all you need axe body spray so for some
3542000	3546000	reason we do something really not intuitive we all go to
3546000	3549000	the hard rock casino yeah which is just a bunch of
3549000	3552000	asshole oh my god but we stood there in the circle bar
3552000	3554000	in the middle of the casino and I remember the three
3554000	3558000	why is it called the circle bar it's a great question
3558000	3561000	it's a good question fair question yep because it was
3561000	3564000	named after Jonathan circle who discovered it while
3564000	3568000	chasing a bear yeah it's a circular bar in the middle of
3568000	3570000	the casino which is also circularly shaped do we end up
3570000	3572000	calling it like the shark's nest or something we had
3572000	3576000	some weird name for it yeah because well we I had this
3576000	3579000	in like we stood there like like a little triangle
3579000	3584000	facing at the circle bar yeah right like like three
3584000	3587000	years wrong with this picture but people kept coming
3587000	3591000	up to us why are you at the circle bar if you're in
3591000	3595000	triangle path do it as Bill Cosby why are you in the I
3595000	3602000	can't do all right all right so excuse me no no I can't
3602000	3605000	do it I'm sorry this people were like we were just
3605000	3607000	laughing so hard and finishing each other's sentences
3607000	3610000	and there were moments where we weren't talking at all
3610000	3613000	and we were just like like making eye contact and
3613000	3616000	laughing and I was like what did you think I just said
3616000	3618000	yeah and you would say exactly what I thought we were
3618000	3622000	all we it was a good it was a good hive mind going on
3622000	3624000	yeah for sure so this guy came up and he had like a
3624000	3627000	bad like kind of a shiny shirt he bought at a Vegas
3627000	3630000	store and he kind of looked like he was having a bad
3630000	3632000	night and he was like one of the few people that came
3632000	3635000	up to said hey uh is it okay if I hang out with you
3635000	3637000	guys we're like we're like why like because like you
3637000	3640000	guys are having so much fun like we're absolutely
3640000	3642000	like you can hang out so he laughed and laughed and
3642000	3645000	laughed then we stood by the near the bathrooms were
3645000	3648000	the trombones in the air yeah saxophones it was there
3648000	3651000	like there's like a chandelier made a saxophone and
3651000	3653000	there's a dome and so like you can hear the sounds
3653000	3655000	from across the other side oh yeah so someone's
3655000	3657000	walking that way their voice hits the dome and it
3657000	3659000	sounds like they're behind you you maybe have seen
3659000	3662000	like that like rotunda kind of laughing and laughing
3662000	3664000	and you were going nuts at this point you know like it
3665000	3667000	was it was six hours of just like hysteria the thing
3667000	3669000	I was talking about today because because when it
3669000	3671000	came up when you get when I knew what you guys did
3671000	3674000	yesterday I was at this you know barbecue and drugs
3674000	3677000	came up not that we had any we didn't um but to talk
3677000	3680000	about mushrooms and the thing I talked about was that
3680000	3682000	I remember really well um people walking to the
3682000	3685000	bathroom and then then walking out and being able to
3685000	3688000	tell so clearly by like their aura their whole vibe
3688000	3691000	that they got went and did cocaine like I swear to
3691000	3694000	god it was like it was like I was like oh look at oh
3694000	3697000	oh she's pretty cute oh wow there you Jesus what did
3697000	3700000	she do like and nothing nothing visual it was just
3700000	3702000	like this like a ramped up energy that you're like
3702000	3705000	what was going on and I'm like such a bumpkin when it
3705000	3707000	came to that stuff we just had like people that just
3707000	3709000	wanted to be with us and yeah yeah we were we were
3709000	3712000	just so happy yeah we were and we were like we were
3712000	3714000	all like three Jimmy Stewart's we're just like hey
3714000	3718000	how you doing hey man it came down and then you I
3718000	3721000	mean you are are tall as shit Mike was tall as shit
3721000	3724000	and bald like like like you know like shaved head and
3724000	3726000	then then I so I was just and I was just in the middle
3726000	3729000	there you know point guard and I was like we were
3729000	3732000	just having dishes serving up the high dishes up top
3732000	3735000	yeah so I I at this at this time I had been to the
3735000	3737000	hard rock probably four or five times in my life
3737000	3740000	before that yeah and so the next time I go there is
3740000	3743000	about a year later and I walk into the circle bar
3743000	3746000	oh this is the place and I walk up to the bartender
3746000	3750000	and I said because this is wooden like staircases
3750000	3752000	that go up into the circle bar and it was stationary
3752000	3755000	I'm like when did this stop being a rotating bar
3758000	3761000	and the guy's like what I go this used to be a rotating
3761000	3769000	bar and he goes no I go oh shit yeah yeah I remember
3769000	3771000	because the lights would always would make you feel
3771000	3773000	like you're like there'd be a guy there'd be a guy
3773000	3775000	that was standing perfectly still but in my mind he
3775000	3779000	was going in a circle he was orbiting like a planet
3779000	3781000	and then he would reappear over there I'm like this
3781000	3784000	this man these people just keep spinning around us
3784000	3787000	it was so great my favorite time you weren't there
3787000	3790000	but I hope he doesn't mind me saying it is but I just
3790000	3791000	think it's one of the funniest things I've ever
3791000	3793000	seen and I know the mushrooms help but I think you
3793000	3794000	to be able to if you've been to Vegas you could
3794000	3796000	picture this Dan back at all who also did Second
3796000	3801000	City with me at in Vegas a bunch of us got together
3801000	3803000	I think Jeremy might have been there we were out in
3803000	3805000	front of the Bellagio with those dancing you know
3805000	3807000	they call the dancing fountains and everything and
3807000	3809000	we're all deciding you know mushrooms basically is
3809000	3812000	like especially at Vegas is like you go to a pack you
3812000	3814000	stand in a circle you laugh at all the fucking crazy
3814000	3818000	shit going on around you above you behind you walking
3818000	3820000	by you and then you walk for four feet to say okay
3820000	3822000	let's go somewhere you get there and then you're
3822000	3824000	like that it happens again you know what I mean like
3824000	3827000	that's how we got there we post we had two locations
3827000	3830000	the bar and then the saxophone and we kept going back
3830000	3832000	and forth to them we were inside the Bellagio and
3832000	3835000	it was like fucking the Marx Brothers but you also
3835000	3838000	adopt if you're on mushrooms you also adopt different
3838000	3840000	it's like oh it's not just let's go back to the
3840000	3842000	circle bar it's like let's let's go to the cookie
3842000	3845000	tree that's what it was the shark test it was
3845000	3848000	something else everything becomes its own inside
3848000	3850000	joke it's like you know you're going around the
3850000	3852000	monopoly board like multiple times and renaming
3852000	3855000	stuff and there's so there's like a group of six of
3855000	3857000	us and five of us over here and then all of a sudden
3857000	3859000	we just turn around and back it all it's just
3859000	3862000	watching the watching the the fountains and we
3862000	3864000	could slowly start to figure out that he's
3864000	3880000	pretending like he's their choreographer
3880000	3882000	he's doing it for us but I think he really was
3882000	3886000	doing it like it was so brilliant and he did it
3886000	3889000	for like the rest of like whatever fucking Selena
3889000	3891000	not Selena Gomez what's her name Selene Dion song
3891000	3895000	at that point this is this is this was the 70s but
3895000	3898000	my heart will go on probably it probably was yeah
3898000	3900000	some paparazzi song it was so fun that's that
3900000	3905000	town's a mess and needs it what do you guys think
3905000	3909000	about people who are concerned about people doing
3909000	3912000	drugs who don't because I feel like there are some
3912000	3915000	of them who are concerned about people and that's
3915000	3917000	why they're concerned about people doing drugs and
3917000	3920000	then I feel like there's the 85 percent of them that
3920000	3924000	are getting high off of other people's drug use and
3924000	3927000	are really happy to be concerned about something
3927000	3930000	like the sanctimony of it yeah like whether
3930000	3932000	whether they're some of those people are recovered
3932000	3936000	and then you kind of go okay well so you you you
3936000	3938000	you fought a demon and you're happy about it now
3938000	3942000	you want that to be your thing but then still some
3942000	3944000	people I think there's just a little slice of
3944000	3947000	genuinely evil people who have never done it will
3947000	3950000	never need to do it never done anything have never
3950000	3952000	cared about anyone and are kind of like the feeling
3952000	3955000	that the unconscious suspicion that maybe they're
3955000	3957000	sociopaths or that they'll never have a connection
3957000	3960000	to anybody and that they found this loophole in
3960000	3962000	society where there's like this thing where it's
3962000	3965000	like oh I'm so concerned about that person and it's
3965000	3967000	like they found they found like this little shortcut
3967000	3970000	between like this little wormhole that society
3970000	3973000	offers where you can simultaneously be a good person
3973000	3977000	but be the the most villainous piece of shit in
3977000	3980000	the world that doesn't care about anyone has never
3980000	3983000	done anything nice for anybody is just filled with
3983000	3986000	emotional toxicity and passive aggression and just
3986000	3989000	siphons the life force off of everyone around you
3989000	3992000	and that I think a good sativa would help that
3992000	3995000	you know just like a just like a little just like
3995000	3999000	a little just like a little not a boop a boop
3999000	4002000	they'd be gone but yeah and I think they know that
4002000	4004000	and I think that they feel that that would be
4004000	4006000	annihilation because it would be eliminating the part
4006000	4009000	of them that is more them than the rest of them and
4009000	4011000	I think that they don't like being surrounded with
4011000	4014000	any reminders that that maybe you should just relax
4014000	4017000	and not have that much of an opinion about anybody
4017000	4020000	else and they kind of enjoy the fact that
4020000	4023000	statistically speaking sooner or later people who
4023000	4028000	are okay with drugs statistically speaking every
4028000	4031000	once in a while one of them dies or has a problem
4031000	4033000	or gets sick and I think they kind of fucking love
4033000	4035000	that I think they really love that I think they'd
4035000	4038000	love that as much as we just Western society loves
4038000	4040000	the fact that every once in a while a suicide vest
4040000	4043000	goes off prematurely like we think we were like
4043000	4046000	stoked to hear about that and I think there are
4046000	4048000	people who show up at memorials for writers that
4048000	4051000	overdosed and they're like they're there for the
4051000	4054000	same reason I am on the surface but underneath it
4054000	4057000	they're like this is fucking cool I knew I was right
4057000	4061000	maybe yeah I don't know and some of those people
4061000	4063000	run shows and some of those people spread their
4063000	4067000	cult to everyone underneath them and fuck you
4067000	4070000	do they know who they are no no no let's keep
4070000	4072000	it that way tell me you can just address me
4072000	4077000	directly man
4077000	4078000	come on man
4078000	4080000	no the entire time you were saying that I was
4080000	4083000	thinking about the father from the guy from
4083000	4087000	Footloose who just if he just danced if he just
4087000	4091000	once and he did once at his wedding or something
4091000	4094000	I never saw Footloose
4094000	4097000	I did but you never saw Footloose
4097000	4098000	but you get it
4098000	4100000	yeah how have you never seen Footloose
4100000	4101000	I don't know
4101000	4102000	you know the song though right
4102000	4106000	I haven't seen what's the not Goonies what's
4106000	4108000	the other I've seen Goonies what's the other
4108000	4111000	one that's Star Trek the other one King Kong
4111000	4114000	no I haven't seen Goonies I saw Gremlins but I
4114000	4116000	haven't seen Goonies but well this is really weird
4116000	4119000	to me because I was in your Wikipedia page it said
4119000	4122000	that we've seen Goonies recently it says in your
4122000	4124000	Wikipedia page I like to get it out there that I've
4124000	4129000	seen Goonies but it's like a you got to update that
4129000	4134000	recently you were in a radio play performance
4134000	4136000	you're doing something on Broadway now it's like
4136000	4139000	a radio play that's it's an adaptation of Footloose
4139000	4143000	isn't it and you were a loose
4143000	4147000	like it's a loose foot looser
4147000	4150000	foot tighter
4150000	4153000	the subtitle is a loose interpretation of the
4153000	4154000	Footloose
4154000	4157000	is that a working title or is that a dung deal
4157000	4161000	is it our right if we do a scene from that
4161000	4165000	you play the Kevin Bacon role
4165000	4167000	the fattiest foot
4167000	4170000	yes
4170000	4173000	and well let's say
4173000	4175000	you guys are off book right
4175000	4177000	yeah but it's only because I've seen it a bunch
4177000	4178000	right
4178000	4179000	Shrob you know the performance
4179000	4181000	I'm not studied in it
4181000	4184000	I might pass out
4184000	4185000	yeah
4185000	4187000	I don't feel really good right now
4187000	4188000	what's wrong
4188000	4191000	no we're starting the show right
4191000	4192000	oh
4193000	4195000	maybe
4195000	4197000	you just need to dance
4197000	4199000	oh this by the way this is
4199000	4201000	they do this amazing thing in the show where
4201000	4203000	like if you're sitting in the audience this is
4203000	4205000	happening two seats down from you
4205000	4209000	this is like a thing that I will never
4209000	4211000	mark my words
4211000	4214000	I will never ever
4214000	4217000	ever dance
4217000	4219000	period
4220000	4222000	that's the end
4222000	4223000	oh yeah the end
4223000	4224000	yeah
4224000	4225000	is it that quick
4225000	4226000	that's the end of the show
4226000	4228000	we did not get good reviews
4228000	4229000	that is true
4229000	4231000	I got a test of that
4231000	4232000	wait so
4232000	4234000	the show starts with two people the audience doing that
4234000	4235000	and that's the end of the show
4235000	4236000	yep
4236000	4238000	oh yeah easy to say now
4238000	4240000	it sounds stupid when you say it
4240000	4241000	I will say
4241000	4244000	the production budget is so
4244000	4246000	inexpensive that it actually
4246000	4247000	kind of makes money
4248000	4251000	it's the always sunny in Philadelphia of Broadway shows
4251000	4254000	it's like it's the most profitable Broadway show in America
4254000	4256000	on Broadway
4256000	4258000	yeah we don't even need a stage
4258000	4260000	it's brilliantly conceived but
4260000	4262000	I don't know I just have a hard time when people
4262000	4263000	finally get to see something
4263000	4265000	all the work that went into that
4265000	4267000	and then for you just to chip away at it
4267000	4269000	you know it's like
4269000	4271000	I mean it's easy to do now
4271000	4274000	I just feel like it had first, second and third act problems
4275000	4278000	yeah no I don't disagree there
4278000	4280000	but still
4280000	4282000	you know
4282000	4285000	do you remember the Goonies show that you were in?
4285000	4287000	that was a longer time ago
4287000	4288000	I do remember
4288000	4290000	never feed them after midnight
4293000	4295000	do not get them wet
4295000	4297000	and a third thing
4300000	4302000	but it's probably been discussed
4303000	4305000	I'm sure on this exact show
4305000	4307000	but when can they start feeding them again
4307000	4309000	if it's after midnight?
4309000	4311000	well isn't that answered in this scene
4311000	4313000	from the Goonies play that you guys did?
4314000	4316000	when Dan is trying to express to you guys
4316000	4318000	he wants to do some improv right now
4318000	4320000	oh shit that was it
4320000	4322000	it's too seamless
4322000	4324000	it goes right by me
4324000	4326000	you're off duty
4326000	4328000	I mean I'm not explicit about it
4328000	4330000	Jason and Will, what you guys don't know is that
4330000	4332000	Harmontown over the years
4332000	4334000	we're nearing our, is this our 199th episode?
4334000	4335000	is that true?
4335000	4336000	yeah
4339000	4341000	here we go
4341000	4342000	here we go everybody
4342000	4344000	199 episodes
4344000	4346000	Kristin it
4346000	4348000	you gotta break it over the
4348000	4350000	right in this bottle
4350000	4352000	what the show's
4352000	4354000	as much as the show used to be a kind of a
4354000	4356000	kind of a
4356000	4358000	haphazard loose
4358000	4359000	rambling thing
4359000	4361000	we, I think we can say
4361000	4363000	that we're one of the greatest
4363000	4365000	long-form improv shows of all time
4365000	4367000	it's a
4367000	4369000	we do some of the
4369000	4371000	most well crafted
4371000	4373000	storytelling, character driven
4373000	4375000	long-form improv
4375000	4377000	what was the suggestion, indulgence?
4377000	4379000	it was indulgence
4379000	4381000	and goonies
4381000	4383000	it was, it was goonies too
4383000	4385000	it's nice we finally got back to it
4385000	4387000	people love that
4387000	4389000	I suggest it's still here
4389000	4390000	2011
4390000	4392000	I'd like to take this moment to thank Jane for bringing me
4392000	4394000	special absence by the way
4396000	4398000	do you guys want to try some of this?
4398000	4400000	this shit gets you high
4400000	4402000	is it a real deal?
4402000	4403000	it's real deal
4403000	4405000	you see the grising fairy
4405000	4407000	Jane did you make this glass too?
4407000	4408000	I commissioned it
4408000	4410000	you commissioned the glass
4410000	4412000	Jane works at Corning Institute, right?
4412000	4413000	Corning Glassworks
4413000	4416000	she's the Tony Stark of glassblowing
4416000	4417000	technology
4417000	4419000	and she said she has a gift for us
4419000	4421000	he's got half of it
4421000	4423000	do you want to present that gift now?
4423000	4424000	seems like a good time
4424000	4425000	oh look at this
4425000	4426000	it's beautiful tumblers
4426000	4428000	do you want to explain it?
4428000	4430000	explain it
4430000	4431000	it's glass
4431000	4434000	it's a sodium calcium silicate
4437000	4439000	can you be more specific?
4439000	4442000	twenty-eight percent calcium oxide
4442000	4444000	believe me I can do it
4444000	4447000	at what temperature do those two elements bond together
4447000	4448000	and form glass?
4448000	4450000	Fahrenheit or centigrade?
4450000	4451000	let's go centigrade
4451000	4454000	oh gosh no let's do Fahrenheit
4454000	4456000	come on I'm the guest
4456000	4459000	I'm bi I can do both
4459000	4463000	give us both but put them in whatever order you want
4463000	4465000	2150 Fahrenheit
4465000	4467000	2150?
4467000	4469000	that's when you get everything all melted in
4469000	4470000	you can gather it and work it
4470000	4471000	2150
4471000	4473000	about 1150 centigrade
4473000	4474000	or Celsius I should say
4474000	4475000	damn damn damn
4475000	4477000	so yeah so you've got the double rocks
4477000	4479000	you've got the single rocks glass
4479000	4480000	these were designed
4480000	4482000	I designed them so based on
4482000	4484000	perfect
4484000	4486000	that's what it's for well done sir
4486000	4487000	it works
4487000	4490000	but so they're supposed to be sort of a mashup of a classic rocks glass
4490000	4491000	with the solo cup
4491000	4493000	which is sort of one of the symbols of Harman Town
4493000	4494000	that's awesome
4494000	4496000	so in honor of the 200th episode
4496000	4497000	for Jeff and Dan
4497000	4499000	T's got the absent of malice
4499000	4501000	take a big swing off that wheel
4501000	4502000	because we had a guest when we were in New York
4502000	4503000	Rory
4503000	4504000	what was Rory's last name Dan?
4504000	4505000	Albanese?
4505000	4506000	yeah yeah Albanese
4506000	4507000	and he got
4507000	4509000	he lost his fucking mind
4509000	4510000	he did
4511000	4514000	he went completely bonkers
4514000	4517000	Rory was drinking it like Welch's grape soda
4517000	4518000	yeah he was going at it
4518000	4520000	at some point I just took the bottle away from him
4520000	4522000	I was like no no no no no no
4522000	4523000	I want to taste it
4523000	4525000	Dan's also got the earth shine
4525000	4528000	the original that I brought in episode 78
4529000	4531000	hundred and how many episodes ago
4532000	4533000	latest version
4533000	4535000	it's actually not 135 proof now
4535000	4537000	I've dropped it down to about 110
4537000	4538000	so you can actually drink it
4538000	4539000	oh
4541000	4542000	that's amazing
4542000	4543000	cheers
4543000	4544000	also what I love Dan
4544000	4545000	this is just the olive oil
4545000	4546000	no no no
4546000	4547000	that's the absent of malice
4547000	4548000	so this
4548000	4549000	you take this
4549000	4550000	you infuse it with wormwood
4550000	4551000	and about 15 or 20 other things
4551000	4552000	distill it again
4552000	4553000	add some more color to it
4553000	4555000	and so that's homemade absent
4555000	4557000	that's just homemade
4558000	4559000	if you're listening at home right now
4559000	4560000	start a podcast
4560000	4561000	people just start making you booze
4561000	4562000	it's amazing
4563000	4564000	it's what I'm here for
4564000	4565000	it's called The Secret
4565000	4566000	I found my place
4567000	4568000	these glasses are gorgeous
4568000	4569000	thank you so much
4569000	4570000	that's amazing
4570000	4571000	hey Jane thank you
4577000	4579000	Jane says
4579000	4582000	I'm done with Sergio
4583000	4585000	treats me like a rag doll
4586000	4587000	90s
4589000	4591000	I was into Jane's Addiction
4591000	4592000	and Phil Collins
4592000	4593000	at the exact same time
4594000	4596000	I was a master of both worlds
4596000	4597000	that's your duality
4597000	4600000	that's like your Batman Bruce Wayne
4602000	4603000	alright well
4603000	4605000	so yeah
4605000	4607000	I was trying to pimp us
4607000	4611000	to do a little improv thing
4611000	4613000	because you're both so talented
4613000	4615000	but it didn't work out that way
4615000	4616000	oh I fucked up
4616000	4617000	I fucked up
4617000	4618000	I didn't know that
4618000	4619000	it's not you guys
4619000	4620000	I didn't know you wanted more than that
4620000	4621000	it's really mostly Schwab
4621000	4622000	who knows better
4623000	4624000	I mean the only reason
4624000	4625000	I started doing it
4625000	4627000	is because Schwab started doing it
4627000	4629000	like I never wanted to do that in this show
4629000	4630000	then Schwab would come on
4630000	4631000	and he's delightful
4631000	4633000	and he would like go into these dumb sketches
4633000	4634000	you think I'm delightful Dan?
4638000	4639000	here this whole time
4639000	4642000	I thought you didn't think about me like that
4643000	4648000	I thought you thought it was a fucking piece of shit
4648000	4652000	anyways here's here's Will Forte's Goonies play
4653000	4654000	we're gonna do a scene from it
4654000	4659000	that's premiering next week on Broadway at 9
4661000	4667000	Douglas it's 758 a.m. and the Goonies very hungry
4667000	4673000	what give them something to eat
4673000	4674000	there's a half a sandwich in the fridge
4674000	4675000	I gotta go to work
4675000	4679000	how do we know what time is the appropriate safe time

5555000	5556000	I guess it was top 40 music
5556000	5557000	it was like playing during the dances
5557000	5559000	where I go to the school
5559000	5560000	I'm like
5560000	5561000	I said it was all
5561000	5563000	it was all about sex
5563000	5564000	like I'm not saying
5564000	5565000	I mean obviously
5565000	5566000	as the future continues
5566000	5567000	like the the music
5567000	5568000	it gets more and more like
5568000	5569000	you know
5569000	5570000	obvious
5570000	5571000	sexual
5571000	5572000	but it seemed like
5572000	5573000	back then it was like
5573000	5574000	I'm remembering like
5574000	5575000	when I was 16 to 18
5575000	5576000	it seemed like
5576000	5577000	every song on the radio
5577000	5578000	was just about
5578000	5579000	like it was
5579000	5580000	it was only just
5580000	5581000	it was just like
5581000	5582000	like all that
5582000	5583000	like that song was like
5583000	5584000	if the rhythm feels good
5584000	5586000	to the baby let me hear you
5586000	5587000	ah ah baby
5587000	5588000	it was like an orgasm
5588000	5590000	used as an instrument
5590000	5591000	and then uh
5591000	5592000	and then that poison song
5592000	5593000	was like
5593000	5594000	Do me baby
5594000	5595000	yeah it was like
5595000	5596000	everything was do me
5596000	5597000	that's what happened
5597000	5598000	when bodies start slappin
5598000	5599000	I'm gonna
5599000	5600000	I'm gonna
5600000	5601000	from doing the wild thing

5621000	5622000	yeah exactly
5622000	5623000	um
5623000	5625000	there's a lot of safe sex songs too
5625000	5626000	it's weird because at that time
5626000	5628000	sex was a very dangerous thing
5628000	5630000	yep it was as dangerous as it was ever gonna get
5630000	5631000	and it was like
5631000	5633000	we don't have to take a
5633000	5635000	close off
5635000	5637000	and have a good time
5637000	5639000	wait what was that
5639000	5640000	close off
5640000	5642000	that was me acting like I know how to heart
5642000	5644000	no but I mean what was that
5644000	5646000	I never said a real song
5646000	5647000	we don't have to take a
5647000	5649000	close off and have a good time
5649000	5650000	oh no
5650000	5652000	I don't remember that one
5652000	5654000	we could just play a
5654000	5656000	board game
5656000	5658000	meet your parents
5658000	5660000	and be a tribe
5660000	5662000	it's like it's all about over the pans hand job
5662000	5663000	Jason
5663000	5665000	try humping
5665000	5666000	he's the best kind
5666000	5670000	cause you never have to find out what's inside
5670000	5673000	Jason how many minutes front to back do you think you spent
5673000	5676000	on camera on SNL doing the running man
5677000	5679000	ha ha ha
5679000	5681000	man if you add it up together it's gonna be a lot
5681000	5683000	it's gonna seem like a lot more just in perception
5683000	5685000	but I bet it's probably 12 minutes
5685000	5687000	and it was exhausting
5687000	5690000	cause I have a real bone to pick with this whole new running man challenge
5690000	5693000	I don't like I don't like new generations taking things like
5693000	5696000	like I know I gave hashtag away that was pound
5696000	5697000	when I was a kid we gave it away
5697000	5699000	but the running man challenge which I love
5699000	5701000	I love the song I love the spirit behind it
5701000	5702000	but it's not the running man
5702000	5704000	and I just want to put that on record
5705000	5706000	I just want to put that on record
5706000	5708000	what is the running man challenge?
5708000	5711000	the running man challenge is that it's to that great song
5711000	5713000	I forget who sings it
5713000	5716000	but it's like a kid started in a high school
5716000	5720000	and it's them dancing and then now college basketball teams did it
5720000	5722000	and it hasn't hit like water bucket challenge level
5722000	5724000	and there's no charity attached to it whatsoever
5724000	5725000	ha ha
5725000	5728000	people are just like let's get these diseases out of the way
5728000	5730000	I challenge you to eat a candy bar
5730000	5731000	it's just me huh exactly yeah
5731000	5732000	for who?
5732000	5733000	for me
5733000	5734000	for friendship
5734000	5735000	for your tummy
5735000	5736000	you're starving
5736000	5737000	for hunger
5737000	5739000	you know as a bummer a friend of mine
5739000	5742000	he hangs out at our local bar the drawing room
5742000	5743000	he's an editor
5743000	5744000	and he said hey Jeff
5744000	5746000	if you're free over the next couple days
5746000	5748000	I want you to be in this
5748000	5751000	I need a couple extra clips for this music video that I'm editing
5751000	5754000	and it's like a silly song
5754000	5755000	but I think it's gonna be pretty big
5755000	5757000	I'm like yeah I don't know it sounds dumb
5757000	5759000	and he sent me this clip
5759000	5762000	he sent me a clip
5762000	5765000	of like what I have to do like there's a dance I have to do
5765000	5766000	I'm like I don't know
5766000	5768000	and so I said like some friends of mine they should be in it
5768000	5769000	and they were in it
5769000	5771000	and he's like I think you should be in it
5771000	5772000	it'd be really funny to have you in it
5772000	5776000	and what it was was the watch me whip watch me nae nae video
5776000	5780000	and I could have been in that stupid piece of shit
5780000	5783000	how funny would that be just for me in a suit
5783000	5785000	just to do in the whip or the nae nae or?
5785000	5787000	I don't know what it is I'm behind
5787000	5788000	I don't know what it is
5788000	5789000	you know what it is
5789000	5790000	it's like it's insert
5790000	5793000	remember what the Macarena was like you're a structure guy
5793000	5795000	like it's like this extrapolate
5795000	5797000	well yeah but that's how you become a curmudgeon is by saying
5797000	5799000	sounds like another Macarena
5799000	5801000	no
5801000	5802000	well only if
5802000	5804000	this is just the shadow again
5804000	5805000	no but I mean
5805000	5806000	the Star Wars
5806000	5809000	but then you're not remembering how much joy the Macarena gave you
5809000	5810000	especially you
5810000	5812000	no me specifically yes
5812000	5813000	I called you about it
5813000	5814000	yeah
5814000	5816000	because it was three in the morning
5816000	5817000	I don't know what to do
5817000	5818000	and it wasn't even weird to get a phone call
5818000	5820000	that's how long ago it was
5820000	5821000	yeah
5821000	5823000	and I was like yeah man I know it's pretty intense
5823000	5826000	and I think it made you said it made you feel like you went to spring break
5826000	5828000	even though you never got to go to spring break or something
5828000	5829000	whatever it was
5829000	5832000	that joy that you had at that point
5832000	5834000	people are whipping a nae nae and getting that joy
5834000	5836000	no I did
5836000	5839000	I went to visit my parents in Florida once

5887000	5888000	they were all learning the Macarena
5888000	5894000	and I I was like this is my chance to learn the Macarena without any concern
5894000	5899000	about anything if anything I'm like no matter how awkward I am

6058000	6059000	I can see the bear
6059000	6060000	I've got two phones
6060000	6063000	I shouldn't need to do more than this
6063000	6064000	I've seen the bear
6064000	6066000	there's got to be something I can do
6066000	6067000	I've got to get through to these people
6067000	6068000	wait
6068000	6069000	I'm yelling
6069000	6070000	I'm yelling
6070000	6071000	I'm hanging up
6071000	6073000	I'm just sitting down
6073000	6074000	I'm crying
6075000	6076000	ah

6079000	6080000	well
6080000	6081000	oh he's
6081000	6082000	he's got more bears with him
6082000	6084000	I gotta call both phones now
6084000	6085000	alright
6085000	6086000	I'm telling you
6086000	6087000	there's multiple bears
6087000	6089000	there's a bear problem out here
6095000	6097000	dear God in heaven
6097000	6098000	why
6098000	6099000	oh I destroyed my phone
6099000	6101000	I'm becoming bear
6102000	6103000	oh oh wait
6103000	6104000	oh okay
6104000	6105000	there's no
6105000	6106000	that phone's broken
6106000	6107000	I can't use that one anymore
6107000	6108000	alright okay
6108000	6109000	I'm lighting that bear
6109000	6110000	the phone on fire
6110000	6111000	I'm putting a basket over it
6111000	6113000	and I'm making smoke signals
6113000	6115000	inside the hut
6117000	6118000	signaling the bears
6118000	6119000	hey bears
6119000	6120000	bears
6120000	6121000	if there's smoke in the air
6121000	6122000	that means that you
6122000	6124000	should go up in the sky
6124000	6126000	because there's probably salmon up there
6126000	6128000	and everyone loves smoked salmon
6128000	6129000	I did it
6130000	6131000	ah
6131000	6132000	there they go
6132000	6133000	they're all leaving
6133000	6134000	I did it right
6135000	6137000	time to pick up these hot coals
6137000	6139000	and just play with them in my palm
6139000	6140000	ow
6140000	6141000	God damn it
6141000	6142000	that hurt
6152000	6153000	I feel like
6153000	6154000	I just meant like
6154000	6155000	I thought you were going to do
6155000	6156000	the voice of the guy
6156000	6157000	that was going to do the nae nae
6157000	6158000	and do the shit
6159000	6160000	I was like
6160000	6161000	I was
6161000	6162000	I was doing the
6163000	6164000	right no
6164000	6165000	you were doing the actual nae nae
6165000	6166000	and stuff yeah
6166000	6167000	because now like
6167000	6168000	the macarena was back in the 90s
6168000	6170000	the dances now are a lot more complicated
6171000	6173000	they tell a whole story now
6173000	6174000	yeah
6176000	6177000	did you guys do that bear hunt
6177000	6178000	when you were kids
6178000	6179000	in the
6180000	6181000	pre-kindergarten
6181000	6182000	daycare center
6182000	6183000	no
6183000	6184000	like we're going on a bear hunt
6184000	6185000	yes
6185000	6186000	there was a thing
6186000	6187000	you would crawl a tree
6187000	6189000	I think you'd call it crawling a tree
6189000	6190000	I totally forgot about that
6190000	6192000	you'd turn the lights off
6192000	6193000	and everybody would
6193000	6194000	unbuckle their pants
6198000	6199000	found one
6199000	6200000	found one
6200000	6201000	I found a bear
6202000	6203000	found a bear
6203000	6204000	found a bear
6204000	6205000	found a bear
6205000	6206000	found a bear
6206000	6207000	found a bear
6207000	6209000	I remember when I was in preschool
6209000	6211000	I was like maybe just four years old
6211000	6213000	and no one teaches you how to play doctor
6213000	6214000	but we actually like
6214000	6216000	when the teacher left the class
6216000	6218000	we got Gloria
6218000	6219000	something rather
6219000	6220000	I forget her last name
6220000	6222000	she volunteered to take her clothes off
6222000	6223000	lay under the teacher's desk
6223000	6225000	and all of the men in the classroom
6225000	6226000	well if you just remember her lawyer's name
6226000	6227000	we can call it
6229000	6230000	for real?
6230000	6231000	I forgot her last name
6231000	6233000	Gloria I forgot her last name
6233000	6234000	we assaulted her
6237000	6238000	Gloria
6239000	6241000	so she had all of her clothes off
6241000	6242000	she took her clothes off
6242000	6244000	and me and Jeffrey Kim
6244000	6245000	who was a Korean kid
6245000	6246000	he and I were like the two surgeons
6246000	6248000	why do you have to say his race?
6251000	6253000	well it comes into play
6255000	6257000	you're fucking better
6259000	6261000	you're gonna want to know he was Korean
6263000	6265000	it comes into play
6267000	6268000	but like it was just like
6268000	6270000	kids exploring each other's body
6270000	6271000	it was totally alright
6271000	6272000	yeah
6273000	6275000	this was preschool?
6275000	6276000	yeah yeah
6276000	6277000	that's good
6277000	6279000	because that really explained why
6279000	6281000	we needed to know he was Korean
6281000	6283000	it really came into play
6283000	6285000	he definitely came into play
6285000	6286000	I mean
6286000	6288000	so I'm fucking Jeffrey Kim
6288000	6289000	and I mean
6289000	6291000	I mean fucking him
6291000	6293000	Korean style
6293000	6294000	oh there we go
6294000	6295000	that makes sense
6299000	6300000	and the teacher comes back
6300000	6301000	I found the Elmer's
6301000	6302000	what the fuck is going on here?
6302000	6304000	stop fucking Jeffrey Kim
6304000	6307000	get that out of Jeffrey Kim right now
6307000	6310000	and put it in the air
6310000	6311000	so
6311000	6314000	Jeffrey Kim starts fucking the teacher
6314000	6315000	it was fucking
6315000	6317000	it was way out of hand man
6317000	6319000	that was the 70s man
6319000	6320000	it was the 70s
6320000	6323000	my principal's name was Mr. Fromgen
6323000	6326000	and I'm okay using that name
6326000	6328000	because I would love to go to court
6328000	6330000	and talk about what an asshole he was
6331000	6333000	he loved drills
6333000	6335000	he loved like
6335000	6336000	yeah like
6336000	6338000	no not power drills
6338000	6341000	he had a hand crank siren
6341000	6343000	but it was supposed to be mounted
6343000	6344000	it had screw holes on it
6344000	6346000	you could see it was supposed to be mounted on the counter
6346000	6348000	but he would walk around going
6349000	6352000	why would he make the noise if he had the drill?
6353000	6354000	it doesn't make sense
6354000	6355000	it's redundant
6355000	6356000	it's redundant
6357000	6359000	it's like having a cow and going
6359000	6361000	the sound that comes out of the thing is so great too
6361000	6362000	it's a waste
6362000	6363000	but there were tornado drills
6363000	6364000	fire drills
6364000	6365000	tornado drills
6365000	6367000	and there were bomb drills
6367000	6369000	and bomb drills were funny back then
6369000	6371000	because bomb drills meant
6371000	6374000	you should grow a mohawk because World War 3 is happening
6374000	6377000	like the Russians have launched 47,000 missiles
6377000	6379000	at Brown Deer, Wisconsin
6380000	6383000	gotta take out that Brown Deer, Wisconsin
6383000	6385000	now it's come full circle where bomb drill means
6385000	6387000	holy shit a kid brought a fucking bomb to school
6388000	6389000	it's not funny anymore
6389000	6391000	that the hashtag, the running man I'm telling you
6393000	6394000	oh well
6394000	6396000	but he would also take us into the unfinished area
6396000	6398000	or basement of the school
6398000	6399000	and explain to us
6399000	6400000	turn out the lights
6400000	6402000	whether or not we had survived the tornado
6402000	6403000	or fire or bomb
6403000	6404000	question
6404000	6406000	but I remember the beginnings of the drills
6406000	6408000	would be like line up, boy girl, boy girl
6408000	6409000	that seems silly
6409000	6410000	like the gender
6410000	6412000	these will be your mates
6414000	6416000	your job is to repopulate the planet
6416000	6419000	sperm providers and patty cake makers
6420000	6423000	will be the foundation of our new society
6423000	6425000	tornadoes are repelled by glass ceilings
6427000	6429000	bombs bounce off of them
6430000	6433000	gender dichotomy will be our new weapon
6433000	6435000	against the mutants
6436000	6438000	we were like two blocks away from our neighborhoods
6438000	6441000	tornado siren in Kansas
6441000	6443000	and it was frightening
6443000	6445000	the sky had turned like
6445000	6447000	green, like legit green
6447000	6448000	and it would be the stillness
6448000	6449000	and then the siren would start
6449000	6450000	and we'd go look at the window
6450000	6452000	and me and my younger sisters would be like
6452000	6453000	oh god
6453000	6455000	and then we'd have to go run down the basement
6455000	6456000	you lived in tornado world
6456000	6457000	yeah, yeah
6457000	6459000	it was like the fucking movie that showed on once a year
6459000	6461000	like where tornadoes were famous
6461000	6462000	in Kansas
6462000	6464000	when tornadoes were famous
6465000	6466000	your new A&E show
6466000	6467000	before twisty got it
6467000	6469000	twisty snatched it from us for a little while
6469000	6470000	when tornadoes were famous
6470000	6472000	you were like Archie Bunker
6472000	6473000	geez eat it
6473000	6474000	now these colored people
6474000	6475000	they got all the headlines
6475000	6477000	remember when tornadoes were famous
6479000	6481000	all you had to do was know a few steps
6481000	6482000	rip up a trailer
6482000	6484000	that was talent
6485000	6486000	now this Sammy Davis
6486000	6488000	this Nat King Cole
6490000	6492000	Jason, did you ever see like an actual tornado
6492000	6493000	like a twister
6493000	6494000	no, never, no, no, no
6494000	6496000	were you sad when that
6496000	6498000	mean old lady took her little dog from you
6499000	6501000	no, because my sisters wanted the dog
6501000	6502000	I was a little bit more
6502000	6504000	also I believe you gotta ride the horse
6504000	6505000	in the direction I was facing
6506000	6508000	I have a very faint childhood memory
6508000	6512000	because my great grandpa was from Oklahoma
6512000	6513000	right near you
6513000	6514000	sure, yes, I mean
6515000	6516000	in tornado world
6516000	6517000	yeah, yeah, yeah
6517000	6518000	and I was like
6518000	6522000	I have a very, very like remote childhood memory
6522000	6523000	of like
6523000	6525000	you know how when you're a kid you pretend to be asleep
6525000	6526000	to get the free ride to the car
6526000	6528000	like you just like
6528000	6530000	you just like figured that out
6530000	6532000	I wonder if parents know that
6532000	6534000	that like 85% of the time a sleeping child
6534000	6535000	is just faking it
6535000	6536000	like, like, like
6536000	6537000	do we, do we ever
6537000	6538000	just want to be carried
6538000	6539000	call them on it
6539000	6540000	but I guess that's like sleep shaming
6540000	6541000	and you don't want to do that either
6541000	6542000	because part of it you would listen
6542000	6543000	and you would be like
6543000	6545000	I remember
6545000	6546000	I would do that at like grandma's house
6546000	6547000	and they'd go
6547000	6548000	is he really sleeping
6548000	6549000	is he faking and I'd be like
6549000	6550000	fuck you bitch
6552000	6553000	you'd think that or say that
6553000	6554000	I would think that
6554000	6555000	you wouldn't say it
6555000	6557000	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
6557000	6558000	I'm afraid Roger Rabbit character
6558000	6559000	yeah, yeah, I feel ya
6559000	6560000	I didn't have that word power yet
6560000	6561000	yeah
6561000	6563000	I was like, I would have been goo goo gaga
6563000	6565000	but I was like, I was like, I was like
6565000	6567000	don't you dare like, like Aunt Susie
6567000	6569000	don't you dare like, like, like
6569000	6571000	like sleep shame me
6571000	6572000	I could be asleep
6572000	6574000	that's what's important
6574000	6577000	all you're doing half the time I'm awake you're hoping I fall asleep
6577000	6578000	yeah, all you do is, yeah
6578000	6581000	you're always complaining about my energy level
6581000	6582000	I was like lay down on a sleeping bag
6582000	6584000	and you tell me that I look cute
6584000	6585000	what do you think I'm going to keep doing
6585000	6587000	anything that provides comfort is a potential addiction
6587000	6588000	yeah
6590000	6591000	let's roll with it
6591000	6593000	get me in the car, get me home and shut the fuck up
6593000	6594000	yeah, fucking layman
6594000	6597000	I'm the sack of potatoes you always hoped I'd be
6600000	6601000	so much anger
6601000	6603000	angry little child
6603000	6605000	they poured it into me like a sponge
6605000	6607000	their anger, not mine
6607000	6608000	yours
6608000	6609000	so you used to
6609000	6610000	all of yours
6613000	6616000	so I have this faint memory of like being carried
6616000	6619000	I was pretensely sleeping and my dad carried me
6619000	6622000	through what seemed like a tornado
6622000	6623000	there was a tornado
6623000	6625000	we went to the tornado cellar
6625000	6627000	every place in the lower midwest
6627000	6629000	has a tornado cellar
6629000	6630000	yeah, yeah
6630000	6633000	it's not like a special thing like bomb shelters
6633000	6635000	it's like everybody has a tornado cellar
6635000	6637000	and do you guys have one?
6637000	6638000	we just had a basement
6638000	6640000	or how the basement was underground
6640000	6641000	like legit, so
6641000	6642000	I don't know how I sound
6642000	6643000	I don't mean to brag
6643000	6644000	I don't mean to brag
6644000	6645000	fully underground
6645000	6646000	we hid under
6646000	6647000	yeah
6647000	6649000	we used to hide under the pool table
6649000	6650000	yeah
6650000	6651000	you gotta make a
6651000	6652000	that's a good way to find it
6652000	6653000	what do you guys think about that?
6653000	6655000	that earthquake thing they go like hide under a thing
6655000	6656000	it looks like
6656000	6658000	isn't that just to create a pocket of air so you die slowly?
6658000	6660000	you're supposed to do it to find a triangle, right?
6660000	6661000	yeah
6661000	6664000	you're supposed to find something that won't immediately break
6664000	6667000	by the initial impact of everything above you
6667000	6670000	but that just means that you'll take days to die
6671000	6672000	yeah, I mean
6673000	6674000	because either something's falling
6674000	6676000	either you're where things are falling
6676000	6678000	that much on top of you
6678000	6680000	in which case you're either dead right away
6680000	6681000	or dead in three days
6681000	6683000	this is my opinion, I hope I'm wrong
6683000	6684000	yeah
6684000	6685000	but when they say like find a doorway
6685000	6686000	they're like
6686000	6688000	you know, there's been that cynical joke of that
6688000	6690000	that's where they look to find you
6690000	6692000	but I think that there's a truth to that
6692000	6693000	where they're saying like
6693000	6694000	whoa, there's air pockets
6694000	6695000	structural air pockets
6695000	6698000	and that's where people have been for like three days
6698000	6701000	I'm somewhat claustrophobic
6702000	6704000	yeah, but that might be a first world problem
6704000	6706000	that the second you're sort of underneath a bunch of rubble
6706000	6707000	you'll be like
6707000	6709000	oh, this is a lot worse than not
6711000	6713000	you're saying that in the third world
6713000	6714000	they're like
6714000	6715000	actually, at least my boss isn't whipping me
6715000	6716000	yeah
6716000	6717000	third world it's like
6717000	6719000	the world's, the earth's shaking
6719000	6720000	this could all turn out better than it was
6720000	6721000	but they're like
6721000	6722000	snow day
6723000	6724000	I would only assume
6724000	6725000	when we were kids
6725000	6726000	when it was snowing
6726000	6727000	we couldn't go to school
6727000	6728000	we'd run out and dig holes in the snow
6728000	6729000	and stay in it
6730000	6731000	they're like
6731000	6732000	it's so funny
6732000	6734000	the rest of the world is so poor
6737000	6738000	depravity is there
6738000	6739000	when I was a kid here
6739000	6740000	I don't know if it happened anymore
6740000	6741000	but when I was a kid
6741000	6742000	there were smog days
6742000	6743000	where the air quality was so bad
6743000	6745000	we weren't allowed to go outside and have recess
6745000	6746000	because you would get like a burning
6746000	6748000	like painful chest
6748000	6749000	like it was really, really bad
6749000	6750000	you couldn't go to like
6750000	6751000	basketball practice or anything
6751000	6752000	you had to stay inside
6752000	6754000	and not ever go outside
6754000	6755000	because the smog was so bad
6755000	6756000	yeah
6756000	6758000	then they took the lead out of the gasoline
6758000	6759000	and I think that stopped
6760000	6761000	yeah
6761000	6762000	that's a lie
6762000	6763000	that's a huge lie
6763000	6764000	that's very, very
6764000	6765000	a huge lie
6765000	6766000	I can't believe it
6766000	6767000	you know Sammy Snopes

6895000	6896000	one of the greatest
6896000	6897000	Rosie Perez impressions
6897000	6898000	as you've ever

6911000	6912000	delightful movie
6912000	6913000	it's an independent movie
6913000	6914000	this is really like
6914000	6915000	it's a comparison
6915000	6916000	no not at all
6916000	6917000	it's a big old studio movie
6917000	6918000	but when you watch it
6918000	6919000	you're just like oh my god
6919000	6920000	the outfit that Wesley Snipes wears
6920000	6921000	while playing basketball
6921000	6923000	is one of the most hilarious things
6923000	6924000	no one's ever played sports
6924000	6925000	wearing a painter's hat
6925000	6928000	he's like a gay Italian bicyclist
6929000	6931000	Wesley Snipes dressed like that
6931000	6932000	Wesley Snipes outfit
6932000	6933000	is just as ridiculous
6933000	6935000	he's got the bicycle hat
6935000	6936000	flipped up
6936000	6938000	and a very deep cut tank top
6938000	6939000	were you saying Wesley or
6939000	6940000	Wesley
6940000	6941000	oh I'm sorry Woody Harrelson's

6949000	6950000	anyway we saw her at a restaurant
6950000	6951000	right when we first moved to the hood

6979000	6981000	this dummy thought it was a joke
6981000	6982000	maybe it wasn't as I'm saying it now
6982000	6983000	is it okay to talk about
6983000	6985000	what your wife is doing
6985000	6987000	while she's here
6987000	6988000	yeah I think so

7001000	7002000	you know what I mean

7004000	7005000	and it's going to
7005000	7006000	be how it's going to be
7006000	7007000	but it's not
7007000	7008000	it's like
7008000	7009000	she acquires nothing
7009000	7011000	except for potentially diseases
7012000	7013000	and you just watch it

7046000	7047000	oh that's a terrible
7047000	7048000	no no no
7048000	7049000	I just
7049000	7050000	I just touched it
7050000	7051000	I touched it by accident
7051000	7052000	first there was a
7052000	7053000	yeah that's how it started
7057000	7058000	I was like
7058000	7059000	and I was of course
7059000	7060000	I was like
7060000	7061000	yeah well okay
7061000	7062000	as long as it
7062000	7063000	cause that's why I had this podium
7063000	7064000	cause I've been touching it by accident
7064000	7065000	during the entire show
7066000	7067000	is she doing
7067000	7068000	she's doing a music video
7068000	7069000	or something
7069000	7070000	yeah she's directing a music video
7070000	7071000	for the Red Hot Chili Peppers
7071000	7072000	okay
7072000	7073000	yeah
7073000	7074000	she's had phone calls with Flea
7074000	7075000	and she's just like
7075000	7076000	oh my god
7076000	7077000	it's like the 15 year old me
7077000	7078000	like you know
7078000	7079000	it's one of those
7079000	7080000	nuts moments for her
7080000	7081000	it's her second one
7081000	7082000	she directed an Edward Sharp video
7082000	7083000	and then this is her second
7083000	7084000	yeah that doesn't
7084000	7085000	she doesn't need anything plugged
7085000	7087000	but I think it's worth promoting
7087000	7089000	Olivia Wilde's director and producer
7089000	7090000	100%
7090000	7091000	no it's the
7091000	7092000	it's one of the
7092000	7093000	I mean it's one of the most amazing things about
7094000	7095000	you know
7095000	7096000	being with her is like
7096000	7097000	is being able to brag about her
7097000	7098000	but this one is such a cool one
7098000	7099000	I told
