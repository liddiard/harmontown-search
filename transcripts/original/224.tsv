0	27000	From a strange hanger, Quonset Hut, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.
27000	41240	An awesomely international harmontown is now in session.
41240	48240	Welcome to the stage, the Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.
48240	57000	Oh fuck, oh fuck.
57000	62080	He seems high, but he couldn't score, so he's not, oh, don't you worry.
62080	66520	If anybody's holding, meet Spencer backstage.
66520	67520	Don't you worry.
67520	68520	All right.
68520	69520	Oh.
70520	71520	I don't know something you know.
71520	72520	I'm plenty high.
72520	73520	Oh, good boy.
73520	76520	Let's bring out the mayor, shall we?
76520	77520	Jay Harmon.
77520	83520	Good day.
83520	88520	I say good day to you.
88520	92520	Thank you so much.
92520	94520	I won't say it like you.
94520	96520	I'm here to bring you variety.
96520	98520	I'm not going to just mock your accent.
98520	101520	I'm going to let you think that I talk funny.
101520	103520	Good, good day.
103520	105520	Struth.
105520	108520	Crikey.
108520	110520	I like that hat.
110520	115520	But I have been working on my Australian accent, and it's very difficult accent, as you guys don't know.
115520	116520	You don't know that.
116520	119520	You think it's quite natural.
119520	121520	Dan was actually cramming backstage.
121520	123520	That's all he was doing.
123520	125520	No, I don't have an accent.
125520	127520	He had YouTube tutorials on.
127520	129520	One sentence, and it's perfect.
129520	130520	I do, I do.
130520	131520	Okay, all right.
131520	132520	Here's what I've learned.
132520	136520	Here's what I've learned so far.
136520	141520	I like that hat, Mike.
146520	153520	Your eyes are always, your A's are I's, your A's are E's.
153520	155520	And the T's are's and G's.
156520	159520	And their shrimps are prawns.
159520	165520	And you're supposed to have, this is the part that I can't get, because I'm concentrating too hard,
165520	170520	but you're supposed to have a playful, soft, twangy tone.
170520	173520	That's what really separates it from the cockney.
173520	177520	If a lot of people try to do Australian that aren't Australian, they slip into cockney,
177520	181520	because you're like, oh, wait, Mike, don't look at gov, no.
181520	189520	But professionals like me, accentologists, we know that you're supposed to let your tongue,
189520	191520	you're not supposed to move your tongue that much.
191520	197520	You're supposed to just let it sit as if it was laying over a ball in your mouth.
197520	199520	Don't move your lips, somebody said.
199520	203520	So don't move your lips or your tongue.
203520	208520	And then say, I like that hat, Mike.
208520	212520	I like that hat, Mike.
212520	213520	Wait.
213520	214520	Mike?
214520	217520	I can't tell if they're applauding ironically or not.
217520	218520	I think they're impressed.
218520	220520	I like that hat, Mike.
220520	221520	I can't do it fast.
221520	228520	Now let's say, hey, somebody call me an Uber, I have to be home by 7.
228520	231520	How are you?
231520	245520	Somebody call me an Uber, call me an Uber.
245520	246520	You're moving your lips too much.
246520	247520	You're moving your lips.
247520	251520	I have to be home by 7.
251520	255520	Mike, you sound British, lady.
255520	256520	Don't you dare.
256520	261520	You know both you and I consider that the height of offense.
261520	263520	We're sister colonies.
263520	265520	We did the same thing at the same time.
265520	273520	We're terrible, horrible genocidal maniacs that were kicked out of the crown.
273520	276520	And we had banished to a godless land.
276520	278520	I think we left, though.
278520	282520	And now, come on, nobody wanted no Puritans hanging around.
282520	285520	No, we were being a...
285520	288520	I'm not saying they loved them.
288520	289520	I think they left.
289520	292520	I mean, I guess there's a little bit more of a criminal thing with the Australians.
292520	293520	Well, there was.
293520	295520	They got over that pretty quick.
295520	298520	When our prison colony shut down, they opened up Australia.
298520	299520	All right, okay.
299520	300520	That's what she said.
300520	307520	When our prison colony just shut down, or as we would put it in America, when there's
307520	311520	no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
311520	313520	George Romero.
313520	317520	Yeah, but anyways, I mean, we're obviously siblings, you know?
317520	318520	We're...
318520	321520	Even if you're not from here, even if you're not...
321520	325520	But these guys have a lot of Chinese action going.
325520	328520	We got someone from Shenzhen, right in the second or third round.
328520	333520	Yeah, so that's where the phrase fair dinkum comes from.
333520	334520	Fair dinkum.
334520	335520	Do you know that phrase, Jeff?
335520	336520	I do not.
336520	338520	Fair dinkum.
338520	343520	Ask me if you like my hat, Mike.
343520	345520	Do you like your hat?
345520	347520	True blue I do.
347520	348520	Fair dinkum.
348520	349520	Fair dinkum.
349520	350520	It's a great hat, Mike.
350520	351520	All right.
351520	352520	All right.
352520	353520	All right.
353520	354520	Come on.
354520	355520	All right.
355520	356520	All right.
356520	357520	That's it.
357520	358520	That's the whole show.
358520	359520	That's all I have.
359520	360520	I truly spent like an hour trying to...
360520	364520	I have assimilated quite well with your hat and your West End shirt.
364520	367520	West End massive.
367520	368520	I don't know what this means.
368520	371520	I hope this doesn't make me homophobic or...
371520	372520	I'm hoping...
372520	373520	I'm hoping this is...
373520	374520	I don't know if this is like...
374520	375520	Okay, good.
375520	376520	I'm an advocate.
376520	377520	I didn't want to...
377520	380520	There was a shirt next to this one in the shop that I got it.
380520	384520	The shirt said homosexuals are gay.
384520	389520	And I didn't know if I got that one whose side I was on.
389520	393520	I don't know what that meant, but I...
393520	395520	Okay.
395520	397520	That's very brave of you, sir.
397520	398520	He said...
398520	399520	He said they are.
399520	400520	Or mad at me.
400520	401520	But he shouldn't have said they are.
401520	404520	He should have said they are.
404520	405520	It's rule number five.
405520	406520	Your eyes are oi's.
406520	407520	Your a's are a's.
407520	408520	Your a's are as.
408520	409520	Your a's are as.
409520	410520	Cheers.
410520	411520	Cheeses.
411520	414520	Now Dan came into this bar called the End in the West End,
414520	415520	which is a cool little bar.
415520	416520	Right?
416520	417520	And so we were there yesterday.
417520	420520	We met, I think, the owner, right, Nick?
420520	421520	And we had a good old time.
421520	423520	He's a fan of Rick and Morty in Harmon Town, I think.
423520	426520	And lots of people that were there that knew the show.
426520	428520	And Dan came in today.
428520	430520	And we said, Dan, you got to get a hat.
430520	433520	We thought maybe getting a cork hat or a slouch hat.
433520	434520	Or something, you know, like...
434520	435520	What do they call the...
435520	437520	An Acuba.
437520	439520	An Acura.
439520	440520	An Acura.
440520	441520	An Acura.
441520	444520	So Dan bought a brand new Acura legend.
444520	446520	A Cordoba?
446520	447520	Acura.
447520	448520	Acura.
448520	449520	Acura.
449520	450520	Acura.
450520	451520	Acura.
451520	452520	Your enthusiasm.
452520	453520	Acura Gooding, Jr.
453520	454520	Acura Gooding.
454520	455520	That's actually...
455520	457520	That's the state we're going to next, Acura Gooding.
457520	458520	It goes Queensland.
458520	459520	We're in Queensland right now.
459520	462520	And then clockwise around Australia, you know, it's...
462520	463520	I wrote it down here somewhere.
463520	465520	I think it's...
465520	466520	It goes from here.
466520	469520	We go to Struth.
469520	472520	And then Billabong and Flapjacket.
472520	473520	But...
473520	475520	But today Dan walks into the bar.
475520	476520	We lost him.
476520	479520	I thought Dan just got lost because he was trying to buy Breathe Right strips because
479520	481520	he's been snoring on this trip.
481520	482520	And we lost him throughout.
482520	486520	He comes back into the bar wearing this West End massive shirt and this...
486520	488520	This strange hat.
488520	492520	And then the owner comes in wearing West End massive shirt.
492520	494520	He made that shirt.
494520	497520	He was wearing that accidentally at the same time.
497520	498520	It was fantastic.
498520	499520	It was great.
499520	500520	It was true blue.
500520	502520	Fair dinkum.
502520	503520	Fair dinkum.
503520	507520	But Dan, in that hat, because you look a little bit like Hank Williams III.
507520	509520	Yeah, I'm not really fitting in.
509520	510520	No, no, not III.
510520	511520	Junior.
511520	512520	You look like Hank Junior.
512520	515520	I feel like I'm ready for some Australian rules football right now.
515520	516520	But I've been trying to fit in.
516520	522520	I got the hat and I love flat whites instead of cappuccinos.
522520	527520	And of course, who doesn't love being terrified of poisonous spiders?
527520	529520	I'm fucking terrified.
529520	530520	God damn it.
530520	531520	So I heard that.
531520	532520	Apparently, this is probably a lie.
532520	533520	I don't know.
533520	537520	The government guarantees that if you get poisoned by something, you get a free airlift
537520	539520	to a hospital or something.
539520	540520	Is that true?
540520	541520	Wait.
541520	547520	But that's not something that you would do if poisonous things weren't constantly murdering
547520	548520	everybody all the time.
548520	549520	Right.
549520	550520	It's kind of like...
550520	554520	If you get bitten by spider, you and a guest spend three days and four nights.
554520	557520	But wait, doesn't everyone get that deal everywhere?
557520	559520	I don't know.
559520	560520	Not in America.
560520	563520	You got to pay for that shit.
563520	567520	Well, yeah, but in America, they still take you to the hospital.
567520	569520	They just then bankrupt you.
569520	570520	Yeah, no, they'll tell you, though.
570520	573520	They'll land the helicopter and say $10,000.
573520	574520	Right.
574520	577520	And then they'll just fly the fuck away.
577520	578520	What's the one called?
578520	579520	The red jacket or the red something?
579520	580520	The red back.
580520	581520	The red back.
581520	582520	The red back.
582520	583520	It's got a red stripe on its back.
583520	586520	It's tiny and it hides under toilet seats.
586520	587520	What?
587520	588520	That's right.
588520	591520	That's the plot to the movie Ghoulies.
591520	595520	No, you're thinking of the white tail.
595520	596520	Equally poisonous.
596520	597520	Even tinier.
597520	599520	And it hides in your wallet.
599520	600520	What?
600520	601520	What?
601520	603520	Check your bedding.
603520	604520	Check everything.
604520	605520	I do like...
605520	606520	My wallet has a zipper on.
606520	609520	And that's why I keep the white tails up.
609520	610520	We're staying in a really nice hotel.
610520	611520	And I don't know if this is...
611520	613520	Sometimes, you know, I'm not going to make any premature.
613520	615520	I'm like, oh, Australia is like this.
615520	616520	Australia is like that.
616520	618520	I'm not some kind of rube, you know?
618520	621520	I'm like, oh, this is Brisbane and this is this hotel.
621520	622520	I don't know.
622520	626520	But I like the hotel that we're in.
626520	628520	Everything is very simple.
628520	632520	There's no dumb art on the wall that's trying to intimidate you into thinking there's more
632520	634520	to life than you understand.
634520	635520	You know?
635520	641520	It's just a picture of some half lady with a surfboard going through her ear or something.
641520	643520	Or a crushed trumpet or something.
643520	646520	And it's like, oh, man, I guess this place is pretty cool.
646520	648520	It's just a blank kind of room.
648520	649520	It's like...
649520	655520	Reminded me of staying in Baraboo, Wisconsin when I was back in the States, back then.
655520	661520	But then I started to realize, oh, I bet this is all simple and clean and nice because they
661520	662520	don't want...
662520	663520	You want to know what the spiders are?
663520	664520	Yeah, exactly.
664520	665520	They want...
665520	666520	I bet this is like a thing.
666520	668520	Like, it's like Arizona is like that.
668520	672520	Like, everywhere you stay in Arizona, it's like clearly like there's no such thing as
672520	676520	a shadow or a corner where a scorpion could fucking jump out.
676520	679520	Grab your face, lay eggs in your goddamn brain.
679520	681520	In my bathroom, I opened up the window.
681520	684520	Like, you can kind of leave the window open.
684520	688520	And there's awesome, like, jungle birds down here that make crazy, like...
688520	697520	They're human beings, Jeff, and they're trying to make a living and they're called sex workers.
697520	700520	So I'm fucking one of these birds.
700520	701520	And I mean...
701520	705520	I like that jungle bird, mate!
705520	708520	What's that bird that just goes...
708520	710520	A what?
710520	712520	A carawong?
712520	713520	Well, if you all...
713520	717520	You're all saying gibberish at the same time, so...
717520	720520	You see these videos of these goddamn kangaroos?
720520	725520	And by the way, they're as fascinated with kangaroos as we are.
725520	727520	Are you talking about Jeff the kangaroo?
727520	730520	He like chest bumps the fucking window door?
730520	733520	There's these videos where there's just kangaroos.
733520	735520	I guess they wander up to people's...
735520	736520	Yeah, Jeff.
736520	737520	That's his name.
737520	739520	There's a famous kangaroo called Jeff?
739520	742520	Well, there's this viral kangaroo, and I think they call it Jeff.
742520	744520	I thought it was a kangaroo problem.
744520	745520	It is.
745520	750520	I mean, kangaroos are the biggest problem behind horses and camels, I believe.
750520	754520	But they come up and they see their reflection or something, and they have human arms.
754520	756520	They're giant rats with human arms.
756520	757520	They look like werewolves.
757520	759520	If you didn't know that werewolves weren't real, you'd be like,
759520	762520	Holy shit, that's a man beast.
762520	764520	Don't let the name fool you.
764520	766520	These are not silly creatures.
766520	768520	They're not fun at all.
768520	771520	They have giant, scary, chimpanzee arms.
771520	774520	They cool themselves off by licking themselves.
774520	776520	That's fucking genius.
776520	781520	They have pockets on the outside of their body instead of uteruses.
781520	782520	They're fucked up.
782520	783520	They're like monsters.
783520	786520	Wait, what's Jeff the kangaroo's deal?
786520	790520	He was hitting this fucking window or some shit.
790520	792520	I think that's the video.
792520	795520	The video is like this guy who's been through it so many times.
795520	796520	Oh, god damn it.
796520	798520	I can't do an Australian accent.
798520	800520	Oh, god damn it.
800520	802520	Get the fuck out of here, you piece of shit.
802520	804520	Get out of here.
804520	807520	You fucking piece of shit.
807520	810520	I don't like your hat, mate.
810520	813520	You're not wearing one, but if you did, I wouldn't like it.
814520	815520	Oh, I forgot.
815520	816520	Everything's a question.
816520	818520	Everything's got to be a question.
818520	819520	I forgot that part.
819520	820520	I'm sorry about that.
820520	821520	Everything's a question.
821520	824520	Everything's up at the end.
824520	826520	Everything's a question.
826520	828520	I like that hat, mate.
828520	829520	Do I?
829520	830520	Do I?
830520	831520	I don't know.
831520	833520	Maybe I don't.
833520	834520	I'm trying.
834520	837520	While we're on the subject of Jeff the kangaroo,
837520	842520	we were told by our liaison, our tour manager,
842520	843520	what is she?
843520	844520	Tour manager.
844520	845520	She's a jungle bird.
845520	846520	She's...
849520	851520	You said that, not me.
852520	853520	Well, she likes it.
853520	854520	Alice, you're from where?
854520	855520	Sydney?
855520	856520	It was from Sydney.
856520	860520	She's convinced that there's a term that is only here,
860520	866520	local to Brisbane, get jeffed or like I jeffed somebody.
866520	868520	Anybody know what that is?
868520	869520	What?
869520	870520	See?
870520	871520	Nobody knows, Alice.
871520	873520	She tried to convince me for the last two days
873520	875520	that that meant finger blasting somebody.
875520	877520	Yeah.
877520	880520	Nobody fucking can bear that out.
880520	881520	Yeah.
881520	883520	It's like, oh, I've got jeffed in the parking lot last night.
883520	884520	Right.
884520	885520	Do you think she was...
885520	886520	Do you think that that was...
886520	887520	I don't know.
887520	890520	Do you think that she's sexually harassing you?
890520	891520	Right?
891520	892520	Do they have that here?
892520	894520	I don't know.
894520	899520	I hope Jeffrey or Jeff the kangaroo gets jeffed.
899520	900520	Jeff.
900520	901520	Jeff.
901520	905520	Jeff's out there getting banging on my glass.
905520	910520	Also, I was told by other people, I did not bother to look it up
910520	912520	because I was too busy drinking all day,
912520	916520	that all koalas have chlamydia.
916520	917520	See?
917520	918520	There we go.
918520	919520	You hear that, Alice?
919520	920520	That's called confirmed.
920520	921520	Yeah.
921520	923520	That's the APA style.
923520	924520	We confirmed that.
924520	927520	Now, do they all have it or do most koalas have it?
927520	930520	Oh, koalas have chlamydia.
930520	933520	Oh, koalas have chlamydia.
933520	937520	Oh, koalas have chlamydia.
937520	940520	It's called chlamydia.
940520	942520	I hit that by mistake.
942520	945520	Well, they eat the eucalyptus leaves,
945520	949520	and they have diseases you believe.
949520	953520	They'll give them to you if you sleep with thieves.
953520	954520	Thieves.
954520	955520	Thieves.
955520	956520	Thieves.
956520	957520	That's koala justice.
957520	959520	That's koala justice.
959520	963520	Do they have, do 100% of koalas have chlamydia?
963520	965520	That's a common stereotype.
965520	968520	So it's 98.
968520	971520	98, Mike.
971520	979520	Now, can a human being contract chlamydia by handling a koala?
979520	980520	Sometimes.
980520	981520	Without a doubt.
982520	985520	Do you say without a doubt or we don't know?
985520	988520	He might have said pass the salt, so we don't fucking know.
988520	990520	You fucking monster people.
990520	992520	You talk weird.
992520	996520	So are there cases of human beings that have contracted chlamydia
996520	999520	by hanging out with koalas?
999520	1000520	We're divided.
1000520	1002520	We're divided on that one.
1002520	1005520	But no one's ever heard of Jeffing being fingerbanging.
1005520	1009520	No one's ever Jeffed a koala and lived to tell about it.
1009520	1012520	But the night is very young.
1012520	1014520	Fucking somebody bring me a koala.
1014520	1016520	I'm going to Jeff that fucker.
1016520	1017520	Fair dinkum.
1017520	1018520	I Jeffed a koala.
1018520	1021520	Now I got the chlamydia.
1021520	1024520	It's a question.
1024520	1026520	Do we have anybody?
1026520	1029520	I've crossed the threshold into offensive.
1029520	1037520	Do we have anybody who just, you're not afraid to speak.
1038520	1041520	Someone with a nice speaking voice.
1041520	1044520	And if you know about Doritos, that helps.
1044520	1045520	This guy in the front.
1045520	1047520	He probably knows about Doritos.
1047520	1048520	Come on up if you'd like to.
1063520	1064520	What's your name, sir?
1064520	1065520	Echo.
1065520	1066520	Echo?
1066520	1067520	Echo.
1067520	1070520	Like you know in the Grand Canyon when you throw your shit down there and it echoes?
1070520	1071520	No.
1071520	1073520	All right.
1073520	1074520	Okay.
1074520	1076520	That was a very colorful way of describing it.
1076520	1077520	Not reverb.
1077520	1078520	Echo.
1078520	1085520	Echo, I just wrote down these three phrases that I think are very Australian.
1085520	1088520	Like, do you want to read that top one?
1088520	1089520	Can you read that?
1089520	1093520	Last night's episode of Kaff and Kim was Hammo.
1093520	1094520	Hammo.
1094520	1097520	I made up that word.
1097520	1098520	We decided that Dan's...
1098520	1100520	Because you guys nickname everybody here.
1100520	1102520	So we decided that Harmon is Hammo.
1102520	1105520	The Brisbane thing is to call everyone Old Mate.
1105520	1106520	Old Mate?
1106520	1107520	Yeah.
1107520	1109520	If you don't know their name or if you don't care, that's Old Mate.
1109520	1110520	Old Mate.
1110520	1111520	Old Mate.
1111520	1112520	You won't hear that anywhere else.
1112520	1113520	It's just a Brisbane thing.
1113520	1114520	Old Mate.
1114520	1115520	Old Mate.
1115520	1116520	Old Mate.
1116520	1117520	Old Mate.
1117520	1118520	Old Mate.
1118520	1119520	Old Mate.
1119520	1120520	Old Mate.
1120520	1121520	Old Mate.
1121520	1122520	Old Apostrophe Mate.
1122520	1123520	But is the apostrophe for LD?
1124520	1125520	Old Mate.
1125520	1126520	Old Mate.
1126520	1127520	Order!
1128520	1130520	I will clear this Quonset hut.
1132520	1133520	Old Mate.
1133520	1134520	Old Mate.
1134520	1135520	Old Mate.
1135520	1136520	Thank you, Old Mate.
1138520	1141520	It's also the most popular cologne here in Brisbane.
1144520	1146520	Here's the next phrase.
1146520	1147520	Don't move, mate.
1147520	1149520	There's a spider on your face.
1150520	1151520	Don't move, mate.
1151520	1153520	There's a spider on your face.
1153520	1155520	And it's poisonous as...
1157520	1158520	Poisonous as.
1158520	1162520	They say something is something as and then they just stop talking.
1163520	1164520	That's their thing.
1164520	1166520	It's like poison as, mate.
1166520	1167520	Poison as, mate.
1167520	1169520	But it's AZ, not AS.
1169520	1170520	Poison as.
1170520	1172520	This taco is poison as, mate.
1172520	1173520	Yeah, rich as, mate.
1173520	1178520	And then this is a phrase that Jeff Swears was told to him by our Australian friend.
1178520	1180520	Her vag was ledge.
1182520	1191520	I asked a friend who's from Melbourne, I said, give me a...
1191520	1194520	What's the most Australian thing you could say?
1194520	1196520	Her vag was ledge.
1197520	1198520	Okay, so...
1198520	1199520	And I found...
1199520	1200520	This is seriously...
1200520	1204520	Those I wrote, but this is seriously a dialogue I found because I was Googling, like, how
1204520	1206520	to do the accent.
1206520	1208520	And they actually have this dialogue between us.
1208520	1212520	And I said, Jeff, you should do this dialogue with me.
1212520	1214520	And he said, no, bring up somebody and...
1214520	1216520	It's all vodka flying off my mustache.
1216520	1218520	Don't be grossed out by it.
1218520	1223520	If it hits you, it'll kill all the microscopic spiders on your face.
1223520	1224520	Cool.
1224520	1227520	But so I think you be...
1227520	1228520	Wait.
1228520	1231520	Oh, you be Adam and I'll be John.
1231520	1234520	I got this off of, like, I don't know, some website.
1234520	1238520	I think it's supposed to be, like, quintessential Australian dialogue.
1238520	1240520	So you be Adam and I'll do John.
1240520	1241520	Okay.
1241520	1242520	G'day, mate.
1242520	1243520	How you going?
1243520	1244520	How was your weekend?
1244520	1245520	G'day.
1245520	1246520	Yeah.
1246520	1250520	My weekend was heaps good.
1250520	1256520	I went to the beach and had a barbecue with my mates.
1256520	1260520	It was a true blue weekend.
1260520	1261520	Sounds great.
1261520	1263520	How was the beach?
1263520	1269520	The beach was fully sick.
1269520	1270520	Fair dinkum.
1270520	1274520	I caught five waves and then took a break.
1274520	1280520	But crikey, I was nearly bit by a shark.
1280520	1281520	Stroof, mate.
1281520	1282520	You okay?
1282520	1285520	Wish I had a come with you, but I'm glad you didn't get it.
1285520	1286520	I'm afraid of sharks.
1286520	1287520	True blue.
1287520	1290520	Next time, see you later.
1290520	1291520	Bye, mate.
1291520	1292520	Bye.
1292520	1297520	Who was Adam and who was John in that one?
1297520	1298520	He was Adam.
1298520	1299520	Hey, Adam.
1299520	1301520	Yeah, mate.
1301520	1303520	Did your friend John have a stroke?
1303520	1304520	Is he okay?
1304520	1312520	I think his friend John is a shit, I forgot the name of the things that fight Doctor Who.
1312520	1313520	A Dalek.
1313520	1314520	A Dalek.
1314520	1315520	Exterminate.
1315520	1318520	I like your hat, mate.
1318520	1319520	A Dalek.
1319520	1321520	I like your hat, mate.
1321520	1322520	Exterminate.
1322520	1327520	When you've been in the sun too long, you kind of start talking like that.
1327520	1329520	But that's when you've been out for a while.
1329520	1330520	Yeah.
1330520	1333520	We noticed that everyone over 45 dresses like how I'm dressed.
1333520	1334520	Yeah.
1334520	1341520	Like all the young people are like normal earthlings, but then it seems like Jeff's theory was that
1341520	1345520	when you turn 45, they take your driver's license and they just give you an outfit.
1345520	1350520	Because everyone's just walking around dressed like an Australian action figure.
1350520	1352520	It's like Logan's run rules.
1352520	1354520	You hit sanctuary and you have to put on the hat.
1354520	1355520	Yeah.
1355520	1357520	I like that carousel, mate.
1357520	1360520	Echo, are you a local Brisbaneite?
1360520	1361520	I have been for a few months.
1361520	1362520	I just got back from America, actually.
1362520	1363520	Oh, yeah?
1363520	1364520	Yeah.
1364520	1366520	I was in Ohio, Florida, Texas, and California.
1366520	1368520	All the good places.
1368520	1369520	Yeah.
1369520	1372520	I just missed the winter, which was kind of disappointing.
1372520	1373520	And I understand.
1373520	1378520	We have to be careful when we talk about politics here because you have liberals with a capital
1378520	1381520	L, but their liberals are Nazis.
1381520	1382520	Yeah.
1382520	1385520	Like they have everything.
1385520	1394520	I'd like to say we're not doing as bad as you guys are right now, but that's not really
1394520	1396520	the case anymore.
1396520	1397520	Oh, really?
1397520	1400520	What is going on here in your best description?
1400520	1401520	You can tap out.
1401520	1403520	You didn't sign on for this ride.
1403520	1406520	If it's controversial and they're going to start booing or something.
1406520	1407520	I don't think they'll start booing.
1407520	1412520	I think you can just sort of point at any of them and just sort of say, this one is
1412520	1413520	shit.
1413520	1417520	And like half of them will go, yeah.
1417520	1421520	All you really got to rag on is like Pauline Hanson.
1421520	1425520	Pauline Hanson is your number one target.
1425520	1427520	If you want to make friends with them here.
1427520	1428520	Pauline Hanson?
1428520	1429520	Pauline Hanson.
1429520	1431520	Is Pauline like a?
1431520	1433520	Pauline, yeah.
1433520	1434520	Paulen?
1434520	1435520	Pauline.
1435520	1436520	Pauline.
1436520	1437520	Just Pauline.
1437520	1438520	Crunchy.
1438520	1441520	Call it Pauline just to piss him off more.
1441520	1444520	Do some research on him and come up with some nice talking points.
1444520	1447520	First of all, he has a girl's name.
1447520	1449520	Oh, okay.
1449520	1451520	All right.
1451520	1452520	I mean, I have a girl's name.
1452520	1458520	Dan, why don't you leave your cisgender bullshit back in the States, man?
1458520	1462920	Like Jane, I'd like to represent the entire trans community and everything you say will
1462920	1463920	be monitored.
1463920	1464920	Okay.
1464920	1465920	There was graffiti.
1465920	1470920	You saw graffiti that said fuck the system, but spelled CIS.
1470920	1471920	Yeah.
1471920	1472920	Yeah.
1472920	1474920	Fuck that system.
1474920	1476920	Bigger fish now, man.
1476920	1478920	There's fucking Nazis in the White House.
1478920	1479920	I can't even.
1479920	1481920	I got to tell my trans friends.
1481920	1483920	I'm like, I'll be back in a second.
1483920	1484920	Nazis.
1484920	1485920	Nazis in the White House.
1485920	1486920	All right.
1486920	1487920	Anyways.
1487920	1488920	Sorry.
1488920	1489920	Wait.
1489920	1493920	You're saying that your trans friends have to rely on you to get Nazis out of the White
1493920	1494920	House?
1494920	1495920	No.
1495920	1496920	They have to go cool it for a while.
1496920	1498920	I'm saying I may stumble over a pronoun here and there.
1498920	1499920	I'm like terrified for my life.
1499920	1503920	I was like, like, I'm just like, you know, it was like the election happened and then
1503920	1508280	it was like on the night before it, it was like, I'm almost perfect in the way that I
1508280	1509280	think and talk.
1509280	1512920	And then it was like this like fucking monster happened.
1512920	1518080	And then I was like, like, I need a musket and I need fresh water.
1518080	1521720	It really is like, I mean, if I'm assuming most of you are from here, but like, like
1521720	1526720	waking up as a citizen of the United States every day is like we're living in a fucking
1526720	1527720	nightmare.
1527720	1529760	It's it's absolutely insane.
1529760	1531560	It's pretty it's pretty historical stuff.
1531560	1533240	It feels yeah.
1533240	1539360	Like it's now I mean, Dan and I both voted for Trump, but we didn't know.
1539360	1541840	We thought it was a protest vote.
1541840	1546280	We just wanted Hillary to know she didn't take us for granted.
1546280	1547280	We didn't know.
1547280	1548280	We didn't know.
1548280	1550600	We were playing hard to get.
1550600	1557440	That's all they respect the you got to you got to take that red pill.
1557440	1562960	So you guys you have to your liberals with a capital L. But do you use the word liberal
1562960	1566640	with a small L to mean like like the opposite of what your liberals are?
1566640	1567640	Yeah, no, definitely.
1567640	1568640	That must get so confusing.
1568640	1571920	But I guess we have Democrats and it's like, oh, those are guys in favor of voting.
1571920	1572920	Like what?
1572920	1575640	And then the Republicans and it's like, well, yeah, they love republics.
1575640	1576640	What the fuck is a republic?
1576640	1577640	I don't know.
1577640	1580800	And then your your liberals are labor, right?
1580800	1582040	Labor are liberals.
1582040	1586260	And then our labor, which we don't have anybody that calls themselves labor that that's offensive
1586260	1587520	to all of our labor.
1587520	1588520	They're like, I don't labor.
1588520	1589520	I'm going to be rich one day.
1589520	1590520	I'm one scratch off away.
1590520	1593160	I always got confused by the labor name as a kid as well.
1593160	1594160	It was just like, what?
1594160	1595320	This is so confusing.
1595320	1596320	Just pick one.
1596320	1600200	And then you have Tories and poison spiders or Tories for party system.
1600200	1601200	Yeah.
1601200	1603560	I'm all for the poison spiders.
1603560	1608040	And the point the poison spiders are in favor of health care in the form of helicopters
1608040	1612120	that come and take you to the poison centers, but only so they can bite you again is what
1612120	1613120	I'm told.
1613120	1614120	We'll see.
1614120	1616560	The thing is, we didn't need a talking car to broker the deal between the spiders and
1616560	1619040	the piece, the government.
1619040	1621600	We just went there already in our ice cream anyway.
1621600	1626440	It's a reference to my hit show, Rick and Morty.
1626440	1627440	It's a hit.
1627440	1628440	It's a transcontinental hit.
1628440	1632040	The problem with spiders running health care is that when you go and you're at the hospital
1632040	1635440	and you're reaching into your wallet for your insurance card, there's a fucking spider
1635440	1636440	in your wallet.
1636440	1637440	Yeah.
1637440	1638440	And they fucking get you coming.
1638440	1639440	There's spiders everywhere.
1639440	1644280	And what we're told is the bigger they are or the bigger they are, uh, that was good.
1644280	1646440	That actually sounded pretty good.
1646440	1647440	The bigger they are.
1647440	1648440	No, no, no.
1648440	1649440	You're pushing too hard.
1649440	1651680	Uh, the, uh, less poisonous there.
1651680	1652680	Yeah.
1652680	1655000	You got to, just to remind you, you got to talk out of your nose a bit more.
1655000	1659320	Oh, if you really want to get that, that Australian thing, you gotta, gotta put your upper lip
1659320	1660920	up into the nose bridge.
1660920	1662400	So it's sort of coming out of that in.
1662400	1663400	Yeah.
1663400	1664400	Like that.
1664400	1665400	Yeah.
1665400	1672120	Uh, but yeah, so the tiny, there's tiny itty bitty little spiders.
1672120	1674640	Oh, they'll kill you more and they can just kill you.
1674640	1675640	Yeah.
1675640	1676640	Cause they hide better.
1676640	1681640	Has anybody here in the audience tonight ever died from a spider bite?
1681640	1682640	There hasn't been a spider bite yet in 30 years.
1682640	1684040	But that's a misnomer, right?
1684040	1688360	Because you don't buy, uh, die from the bite, you die because your throat swells up and you
1688360	1689360	suffocate, right?
1689360	1697440	Nobody's died, somebody posits from the audience that nobody has died from a spider bite in
1697440	1698440	30 years.
1698440	1699440	Yeah.
1699440	1701440	In Australia or just on earth?
1701440	1702440	Australia.
1702440	1703440	Okay.
1703440	1704440	That's right.
1704440	1705440	Right.
1705440	1706440	But Spencer is suggesting that it's like in the wire when you're, you're just, you're just
1706440	1708680	calling the, the, the death a different thing.
1708680	1710760	Like when they go like, Oh, we don't have a drug problem.
1710760	1713720	This is a, this is like, you don't die from the car crash.
1713720	1714720	You die from the strangulation.
1714720	1715720	Right.
1715720	1718320	So there's a, there's probably like a million spider deaths a week here.
1718320	1722240	But, but your, your, your, your flesh starts to die and your finger falls off and shit.
1722240	1723240	Right.
1723240	1725240	Like it depends which one bites you.
1725240	1726240	Yeah.
1726240	1727240	Yeah.
1727240	1728240	Your, your friend lost his big toe.
1728240	1729240	That sounds like necritis.
1729240	1731600	It sounds like his, his toe necrotized.
1731600	1732600	Yeah.
1732600	1737360	I know all about poison spiders.
1737360	1738760	Who here has a personal?
1738760	1741920	Does anybody hear lost a limb or a chip?
1741920	1742920	Well, all right.
1742920	1746080	Just no, just a per any personal horrifying spider story.
1746080	1748200	It could be right, right in the front row.
1748720	1750280	Is it going to be your friend that lost his toe?
1750280	1752920	Because we don't want to hear about that shit.
1752920	1753920	That's just secondhand.
1753920	1754920	That's an urban legend.
1754920	1757960	I want somebody who has had a spider on their face.
1757960	1766480	Wait, we got a good one in the back row or something.
1766480	1771640	Well, you know, all we know is he's shouting back row, but he's a liberal.
1771640	1772640	Okay.
1772640	1773640	Yeah.
1773640	1774640	Sorry.
1774640	1775640	You, sir.
1775640	1776640	In the tie.
1776640	1777640	Oh shit.
1778080	1779080	Sorry.
1779080	1780080	Get the fuck up here.
1780080	1781080	All right.
1781080	1782080	Personal spider stories.
1782080	1783080	Personal spider stories.
1783080	1784080	Alcoales epimidia.
1784080	1785080	Alcoales epimidia.
1785080	1786080	Personal spider stories.
1786080	1787080	From the land of the antispathes.
1787080	1788080	It's a, it's an alcoala story.
1788080	1789080	Hello.
1789080	1790080	What's your name?
1790080	1791080	Josh.

1795080	1796080	I'm Josh.
1796080	1797080	I'm Josh.
1797080	1798080	Hey, Josh.
1798080	1799080	I'm Josh.
1799080	1800080	Hey, Josh.
1800080	1801080	I'm Josh.
1801080	1802080	I'm Josh.

1807520	1808520	Josh, welcome to the stage.
1808520	1809520	Thank you.
1809520	1810520	Thank you.
1810520	1811520	It's good to be here.
1811520	1812520	I like, I like that hat, mate.
1812520	1814760	I like your hat, too, mate.
1814760	1815760	Thank you.
1815760	1816760	True blue.
1816760	1817760	Hanky dinkle.
1817760	1818760	All right.
1818760	1819760	So, spider stories.
1819760	1821760	Lay it on us, Josh.
1821760	1822760	Spider story.
1822760	1826080	I, I used to live out, and you went, epswitch?
1826080	1827080	Epswitch.
1827080	1828080	All right.
1828080	1830080	It's not that bad, all right.
1830080	1833080	It's just the people.
1834080	1837080	And, oi, ei.
1837080	1838080	Oi, ei.
1838080	1839080	Jesus.
1839080	1844080	This guy's just being hazed for saying where he's from, you know?
1844080	1848080	Are the, are the, are the, are the epswitchians inferior to them?
1848080	1849080	And if so...
1849080	1854080	Well, then, why, why bully him?
1854080	1857080	I just feel sorry for him if you really believe that.
1857080	1858080	I think you protest too much.
1858080	1862080	I think the epswitchians may be superior or you wouldn't be so defensive.
1863080	1864080	Yeah.
1864080	1865080	I, I...
1865080	1866080	Yeah!
1866080	1867080	Epswitch!
1867080	1869080	And I know, I know lies...
1869080	1872080	Anybody else here from Epswitch, may I applause?
1872080	1873080	Oh.
1873080	1876080	Why, why, why, Josh, I'll let, I'll let you answer this.
1876080	1880080	Why does the whole crowd bristle at the name of Epswitch?
1880080	1884080	I have to be very careful because my grandmother still lives in Epswitch, but...
1884080	1886080	She doesn't listen to this.
1886080	1888080	Yeah, true.
1888080	1891080	It's just a little, yeah, Pauline Hanson is...
1892080	1894080	Pauline Hanson.
1894080	1896080	It's a little bit backwards.
1896080	1898080	She's, she's from Epswitch.
1898080	1899080	Yeah.
1899080	1900080	It's a phrobatic.
1900080	1904080	And now she's trying to force her fucked up Epswitch views on the entire continent.
1904080	1905080	Yeah.
1905080	1907080	From, from Billabong to Struthnic.
1908080	1911080	So it's just, it's, yeah, it's not great.
1911080	1913080	But you, you live here now or no?
1913080	1914080	I live in Brisbane, yeah.
1914080	1915080	All right, so you've moved.
1915080	1916080	I've moved.
1916080	1917080	You've gotten out of Epswitch.
1917080	1918080	I escaped.
1918080	1919080	Are you, are you embarrassed to be from there?
1919080	1920080	Are you proud of your Epswitch heritage?
1920080	1923080	It's a really great talking point at a party.
1924080	1930080	But not here because you're going to get your ass handed to you outside after the show.
1930080	1933080	These folks do not like that hat, mate.
1933080	1935080	That hat ain't good, mate.
1935080	1938080	All right, so lay your spider story on us.
1938080	1939080	It is a spider story.
1939080	1942080	It's not a poisonous spider, but it's a huntsman.
1942080	1943080	It's all right.
1943080	1944080	It's okay.
1944080	1945080	Hey, hey, hey.
1945080	1947080	It's all right.
1947080	1950080	It can be a giant, scary, non poisonous spider story.
1950080	1954080	Maybe this is a scarier story than just your friend's toe falling off.
1955080	1958080	I am, so living in Epswitch.
1958080	1961080	Hey, everybody, call the fuck out.
1962080	1966080	There will, there will, there will be walkabouts enforced.
1967080	1968080	You will be, you will be sent.
1968080	1969080	That's like a timeout, right?
1969080	1970080	Exactly.
1970080	1972080	You will be sent on walkabout.
1973080	1975080	If you don't, you don't cool it.
1976080	1979080	The crowd is about to mutiny, and I have no idea.
1983080	1987080	Well, these are things you can think about on walkabout.
1988080	1989080	All right, Josh.
1989080	1992080	Josh, you have the conch right now.
1992080	1998080	We are, so we had a pool, and I wore dick togs,
1998080	2000080	DTs, budgie smugglers.
2000080	2002080	Wait, dick toes?
2002080	2003080	Speedo.
2003080	2004080	Speedos.
2004080	2005080	Dick toes?
2005080	2006080	Dick togs.
2006080	2007080	Dick togs.
2007080	2008080	Dick togs.
2008080	2009080	You know I dick togs.
2009080	2010080	Banana hammock.
2010080	2011080	You know, a fucking...
2011080	2012080	A banana hammock.
2012080	2013080	A budgie smuggler.
2013080	2014080	A marble bag.
2014080	2015080	Yeah.
2015080	2017080	A Cleveland reach around.
2017080	2019080	A Pauline Henson.
2022080	2025080	I don't want Pauline Henson down there.
2025080	2027080	All right, so you're wearing, you're wearing your little snuggies.
2027080	2028080	No, I'm not wearing them.
2028080	2029080	You're not wearing them.
2029080	2030080	I'm about to wear them.
2030080	2031080	You're about, oh dear.
2031080	2033080	I've taken them off the clothesline, and I've put them on.
2034080	2040080	And right about here, I felt a very intense pain,
2040080	2043080	because a Huntsman spider has freaked out,
2043080	2048080	and bitten between my ass and my testicles,
2048080	2050080	which is the taint.
2050080	2051080	See, I say taint.
2051080	2052080	It's a taint.
2052080	2053080	It's a taint.
2053080	2055080	That's worldwide, baby.
2056080	2060080	So you, so as it stands, you have your, your, your,
2060080	2062080	your ball togs, what do you call them?
2062080	2063080	Dicktogs.
2063080	2064080	Dicktogs on.
2064080	2067080	A Huntsman spider has latched onto your taint.
2067080	2068080	Yes.
2069080	2072080	What sort, can you describe the sensation of that?
2072080	2073080	Like, can you put the...
2073080	2080080	I was about nine at the time, and I remember screaming
2080080	2083080	in intense pain, and then for the next hour and a half,
2083080	2086080	my mum had to hold the cold back to my area.
2086080	2088080	You couldn't hold it yourself?
2088080	2091080	Well, I was nine, and I was very scared.
2091080	2094080	Was the, was the, was the Huntsman destroyed
2094080	2097080	by the putting on of the Dicktongs?
2097080	2100080	I thought it ran away, and then we proceeded to be horrified
2100080	2104080	it might come back, but my dad said he killed it.
2104080	2106080	Oh, you think he was like lying?
2106080	2108080	I think he was blatantly lying to me.
2108080	2112080	I saw a video on the internets, but was that a Huntsman
2112080	2114080	that was like crawling up the side of a fridge
2114080	2115080	with a mouse in its mouth?
2115080	2119080	They're about, they're massive, so they're huge.
2120080	2122080	Bigger than a, they can get pretty big.
2122080	2123080	Besides a grown man's hand.
2123080	2124080	Yeah, the grown man's hand.
2124080	2126080	More like your hand, not mine.
2126080	2128080	You're putting on your Dicktongs, and you don't see
2128080	2129080	a fucking hubcap place.
2129080	2131080	I was excited.
2131080	2133080	You couldn't wait to get out there.
2133080	2135080	I was going to get the pool.
2135080	2137080	Place a Marco Polo.
2138080	2141080	I mean, as far as that spider was concerned,
2141080	2144080	oh, look, a lovely little hammer came at her right there.
2144080	2146080	I thought, oh, shit, that guy's going to sit on me.
2146080	2147080	What is he doing in there?
2147080	2149080	Did he think flies would be in there?
2149080	2151080	Were there flies in there?
2151080	2152080	I don't know.
2152080	2153080	Probably.
2153080	2155080	You had a, you had stinky balls when you were nine.
2155080	2157080	Oh, shit.
2157080	2159080	Hip switch sucks.
2160080	2162080	So you're just going for the easy applause.
2162080	2163080	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2163080	2165080	You and your mother are having an intimate encounter
2165080	2168080	where she's holding an ice pack to your balls.
2168080	2169080	Taint.
2169080	2171080	The end?
2171080	2173080	Or did all's well and ends well, or?
2173080	2174080	Yeah.
2174080	2175080	It didn't necrotize.
2175080	2178080	Well, I didn't go, I now don't swim anymore in pools,
2178080	2180080	so I don't know if that's a...
2180080	2183080	So that's put you off swimming at all, like forever.
2183080	2184080	Well, no, I still swim.
2184080	2185080	Oh.
2185080	2186080	But not in pools.
2186080	2187080	Not really in pools.
2187080	2188080	You could just...
2188080	2189080	Why do you blame the pool?
2189080	2191080	That's such a weird connection to make.
2191080	2193080	Well, there's less pools than there are spiders,
2193080	2194080	so I just, you know...
2194080	2195080	What about the shorts?
2195080	2196080	Hedge my bets.
2196080	2199080	Like, the shorts are what you should associate with the...
2199080	2200080	Right.
2200080	2201080	...dictors.
2201080	2202080	I'm going to not wait.
2202080	2203080	I'm not going to...
2203080	2204080	Shorts?
2204080	2205080	I'm not going to explain to you.
2205080	2206080	It's all right.
2206080	2208080	You can experience trauma however you want
2208080	2209080	and cope with it,
2209080	2211080	but I think pools didn't really do anything in this story.
2211080	2214080	If anything, if you had jumped into the pool soon enough,
2214080	2216080	the spider would have drowned.
2218080	2219080	Yeah, that's true.
2219080	2220080	I don't know why.
2220080	2221080	I have poke holes in it.
2221080	2223080	I've told the story on Hammer Time before
2223080	2225080	when a spider fell into my ear one night
2225080	2228080	and I thought there was a marching band inside my brain.
2228080	2229080	Right.
2229080	2231080	I found out that what you do is you just pour alcohol in there
2231080	2233080	and get it fucked up and it falls asleep.
2233080	2237080	Instead, I just kept hitting myself in the head like a moron.
2237080	2240080	And then, at one point, I just wanted to jab a pencil into my ear
2240080	2243080	and just kill myself so that the noise would stop.
2243080	2244080	Yeah, no.
2244080	2247080	And so now, I mean, I'm a live and let live sort of fellow,
2247080	2248080	but, like, fucking...
2248080	2250080	If I see a spider, sorry, fellow.
2250080	2251080	Wait, you don't...
2251080	2252080	But they kill all the flies.
2252080	2253080	Yeah, well, fuck them.
2253080	2255080	The flies don't go into my ear at night.
2255080	2257080	I had three nights in a row
2257080	2259080	where each night I was woken to a spider on my face.
2259080	2260080	What?
2260080	2261080	Like, no joke.
2261080	2262080	No joke.
2262080	2264080	Each night, like, I caught the first one.
2264080	2265080	It was crawling up and I was, like, not gone.
2265080	2266080	Second night, I woke up.
2266080	2267080	It was on the face.
2267080	2269080	Third night, it was trying to get in my mouth.
2269080	2271080	That's when I, like, pulled the bear to pardon
2271080	2273080	for the bug bomb around the room.
2273080	2274080	Jesus Christ.
2274080	2276080	I got to get out of here.
2276080	2277080	This is fucking it.
2277080	2279080	Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
2279080	2280080	Dan.
2280080	2281080	Don't move.
2281080	2282080	Stop.
2282080	2283080	Do you not?
2283080	2284080	It's not even funny.
2284080	2285080	Move, Dan.
2285080	2286080	You just...
2286080	2289080	You get some long grass and you walk up behind them
2289080	2290080	and take them on the back of their mouth.
2290080	2291080	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2291080	2292080	I'm gonna fucking do it.
2292080	2296080	You guys know the typewriter was invented here?
2296080	2297080	Whoa.
2297080	2299080	No, but Wi-Fi was.
2299080	2302080	Wi-Fi was invented here, I'm told.
2302080	2303080	Is that true?
2303080	2304080	It's true, really.
2304080	2305080	I don't know.
2305080	2308080	Nobody out here agrees on a shit that you guys...
2308080	2309080	It's so divided.
2309080	2312080	It's a big continent and there's a lot of them.
2312080	2313080	They're probably all...
2313080	2315080	These are the first time they've seen each other.
2315080	2317080	There's probably different, like, factions and things.
2317080	2318080	They're like...
2318080	2320080	Every street is a boundary.
2320080	2321080	Yeah.
2321080	2324080	Every postcode has another crew in it.
2324080	2327080	I read about the boundary street, so...
2327080	2328080	The...
2328080	2329080	The...
2329080	2330080	So...
2330080	2331080	So...
2331080	2332080	Okay.
2332080	2333080	Christ.
2333080	2338080	I mean, are all crowds here this fucking awesomely loud and...
2338080	2340080	Fucking night!
2340080	2341080	It's Australia, everyone.
2341080	2342080	I love it.
2342080	2343080	I fucking love it.
2343080	2344080	We're all going out to a bar after this, right?
2344080	2345080	We're all gonna go in.
2345080	2347080	Yeah!
2348080	2349080	All right, so...
2349080	2353080	I sat in one bar since 9 a.m. until, like, fucking 5?
2353080	2354080	That was the best.
2354080	2355080	Yeah.
2355080	2356080	We got...
2356080	2357080	But their bars don't open till 10.
2357080	2358080	It was...
2358080	2359080	They don't serve until 10.
2359080	2360080	That was a bit of a...
2360080	2363080	I had coffee and an avocado mash and then I drank myself.
2363080	2364080	Smashed avocado.
2364080	2365080	Smash.
2365080	2366080	Smash.
2366080	2367080	All right.
2367080	2368080	I forgot both of your names.
2368080	2369080	Josh and Echo.
2369080	2370080	Josh and Echo.
2370080	2371080	You forgot Echo?
2371080	2372080	Yeah.
2372080	2375080	The guy who describes himself as what the sound makes when you throw shit down the Grand
2375080	2376080	Canyon.
2376080	2378080	Let's have a hand for Josh and Echo for the show.
2378080	2379080	Josh and Echo.
2379080	2380080	You guys can.
2380080	2381080	I bet.
2381080	2387080	Josh and Echo, you can catch their new animated children's cartoon on Nick at Night.
2387080	2391080	The Adventures of Josh and Echo.
2391080	2394080	Spencer, how's your Australia been?
2394080	2396080	Oh, fine.
2396080	2398080	I mean, I don't know.
2398080	2402080	Anytime we travel, I'm like, what am I supposed to say, that I hate it?
2402080	2405080	Like, it's not gonna go over well.
2405080	2406080	Well, you could probably...
2406080	2408080	They'd probably be willing to.
2408080	2411080	Let's just talk about all the other places I went that I hated.
2411080	2412080	Canada?
2412080	2413080	Fuck it.
2413080	2414080	You don't like Canada?
2414080	2416080	New York City?
2416080	2418080	Forget about it.
2418080	2419080	Florida?
2419080	2422080	Drown that entire state.
2422080	2423080	I agree with that one.
2423080	2425080	Like, just fuck all of it.
2425080	2426080	No, Australia's fine.
2426080	2427080	I don't know.
2427080	2428080	I don't want to get all...
2428080	2432080	I feel like all this material is just, like, hack at this point, right?
2432080	2433080	I don't know.
2433080	2434080	The O's sound weird.
2434080	2436080	You've been doing all this accent shit.
2436080	2439080	I still don't know how to say a fucking O in Australian.
2439080	2443080	As far as I can tell, it's like an A-R-O sound.
2443080	2448080	Like, narrow, kind of, except, like, narrow.
2448080	2449080	But I can't do it.
2449080	2450080	That's the problem.
2450080	2451080	I don't know.
2451080	2452080	What else?
2452080	2453080	Also, just, I mean, you've already...
2453080	2457080	This is well-tron ground even on this show, but just the fucking bugs.
2457080	2459080	I mean, there's a lot of things.
2459080	2461080	There's a lot of animals that can kill you anywhere you go.
2461080	2463080	You could get stepped on by an elephant.
2463080	2465080	You could get murdered by a lion.
2465080	2467080	But those are beasts, right?
2467080	2469080	These are beasts, fearsome creatures.
2469080	2473080	But in Australia, there's literally monsters.
2473080	2474080	Like, I don't...
2474080	2478080	There's things that'll kill you in all the places, like polar bears.
2478080	2479080	Holy shit.
2479080	2480080	But that's not a monster.
2480080	2481080	That's a beast.
2481080	2486080	Like, if you have to use weapons to kill an insect, that's a fucking monster.
2487080	2495080	Like, that's in an RPG, giant monstrous insects that you have to kill with weapons are, like,
2495080	2497080	the lowest-level monster that exists.
2497080	2501080	I'm sure there's probably fucking slime blobs here, too, right?
2501080	2504080	Are you talking about Pauline Henson?
2505080	2506080	Hello!
2506080	2507080	I'm killing!
2507080	2509080	I'm killing!
2509080	2512080	I'm Australia's favorite comedian.
2512080	2515080	I know nothing about anything.
2515080	2521080	All right, Spencer, you're walking down the streets of Australia, and you see a beast.
2526080	2527080	It's just a spider.
2527080	2528080	It's a spider.
2528080	2529080	They're very common.
2529080	2531080	They're terrifying, but common.
2531080	2532080	All right, that was it.
2532080	2534080	I thought it was going to be more mythological than that.
2534080	2535080	Well, you've got to give me more than that.
2535080	2536080	You see a creature?
2536080	2537080	What the fuck?
2540080	2543080	This guy just said rock and roll, assumedly.
2543080	2544080	Very excited.
2544080	2545080	It's a big night out.
2545080	2546080	No, they're excited.
2546080	2547080	That much is clear.
2547080	2548080	What do you want, Spencer?
2548080	2550080	Do you want the name of a creature?
2550080	2551080	I don't know.
2551080	2552080	Whatever you guys want.
2556080	2559080	This is the excitement I was alluding to.
2559080	2561080	I feel like I heard the word wombat.
2561080	2562080	Strompit.
2564080	2565080	Oh, drop bear.
2565080	2567080	They're talking about drop bears.
2567080	2568080	Drop bear.
2568080	2569080	Yeah.
2569080	2572080	Are there any drop bears in the house?
2572080	2573080	Yeah!
2574080	2575080	All right.
2575080	2579080	You hear a strange whistling sound from above.
2579080	2581080	You look up at a brown blur.
2581080	2582080	You're crushed.
2582080	2584080	It's a drop bear.
2584080	2585080	Right?
2585080	2586080	I don't know what a drop bear is.
2586080	2587080	Oh, what?
2588080	2589080	No.
2589080	2591080	I mean, I don't care what a drop bear is.
2591080	2592080	I just don't know.
2592080	2593080	A drop bear?
2593080	2595080	Drop bear, yeah.
2597080	2599080	Oh, a koala is a drop bear?
2599080	2602080	Do they like fall on your cars and stuff here?
2602080	2604080	Oh, a fucking drop bear.
2604080	2606080	Ruined my windshield, mate.
2609080	2612080	They're like coconuts in Los Angeles koalas.
2612080	2617080	They'll just fall on your car and you'll get chlamydia all over your windshield.
2618080	2621080	And insurance won't cover them because they're fucking liberals.
2622080	2624080	Do we have a koala expert?
2624080	2627080	Is somebody like a naturalist out there who knows about it?
2627080	2629080	Are they all suffering from chlamydia?
2629080	2631080	Do they drop dead?
2631080	2633080	They can't stand it.
2635080	2637080	You work with koalas a lot?
2638080	2639080	All right.
2639080	2641080	Get up here. We have to talk to you.
2641080	2643080	You want to come up and explain?
2643080	2647080	I was going to say, I'm not getting a heavy scientist vibe from the crowd,
2647080	2650080	but I guess we have a zoologist here.
2654080	2655080	All right.
2655080	2658080	Approaching the stage is a man who has handled koalas.
2658080	2660080	What's your name, sir?
2660080	2661080	Darcy.
2661080	2662080	Darcy?
2662080	2663080	All right.
2663080	2664080	Darcy?
2664080	2665080	Darcy.
2665080	2666080	Darcy.
2666080	2667080	Oh, Darcy.
2667080	2668080	It's a hot egg.
2668080	2669080	Oh, mate.
2669080	2670080	I'm Hammo.
2670080	2671080	Darcy.
2671080	2672080	All right.
2672080	2674080	So you work with the what zoo?
2674080	2675080	Taronga Zoo.
2675080	2676080	Tarongo?
2676080	2677080	Taronga.
2677080	2678080	Taronga.
2678080	2679080	Yeah, it's in Sydney.
2679080	2681080	I like that zoo, mate.
2681080	2683080	Yeah, it's a good zoo, mate.
2683080	2684080	Okay.
2684080	2685080	That's good.
2685080	2686080	You did it up at the end.
2686080	2689080	But you could use a little work on the ads that they would eat.
2689080	2691080	I'll work on it.
2691080	2692080	Repeat a bit.
2692080	2695080	Kath in Kim was a masterpiece.
2695080	2697080	Kath in Kim was a masterpiece.
2697080	2698080	A masterpiece?
2698080	2699080	A masterpiece?
2699080	2700080	Up at the end?
2700080	2701080	All right.
2701080	2702080	So what...
2702080	2703080	The fuck is happening?
2703080	2704080	I'm coaching.
2704080	2705080	I'm doing dialogue coaching.
2705080	2706080	You're doing great, Dan.
2706080	2708080	I'm learning how to be Australian.
2708080	2709080	Yeah.
2709080	2711080	You just gave my ears chlamydia.
2711080	2712080	All right.
2712080	2714080	So I got it from the koalas.
2714080	2715080	Yeah.
2715080	2716080	All right.
2716080	2718080	So what's the deal with koala chlamydia?
2718080	2719080	Yeah.
2719080	2720080	Go.
2720080	2722080	I mean, that's not the most interesting thing about koalas.
2722080	2726080	What's the most interesting thing about koalas?
2726080	2729080	Their primary food source makes them high.
2729080	2730080	Oh.
2730080	2731080	So does mine.
2735080	2738080	Which strangely is eucalyptus leaves.
2738080	2739080	Chris...
2739080	2742080	Chris Boruff, our technical director and live director,
2742080	2746080	he said that baby koalas have to eat koala shit.
2747080	2748080	Yeah!
2749080	2750080	We did it.
2751080	2752080	Wait.
2752080	2753080	Wait.
2753080	2754080	They have to or they like to?
2754080	2756080	No, they have to and they like to.
2756080	2757080	They like to.
2757080	2758080	What?
2758080	2759080	And kangaroos.
2759080	2760080	And kangaroos.
2760080	2761080	They can't get enough of it.
2761080	2763080	Well, it's probably because I think elephants and stuff,
2763080	2765080	they eat each other's shit, too,
2765080	2767080	because it's like they digest cellulose, maybe,
2767080	2769080	and there's probably like a lot of plants in their shit,
2769080	2771080	and then they just eat it again.
2771080	2772080	I mean, maybe.
2772080	2776080	It's like the really bad version of like the baby bird
2776080	2778080	getting the vomit from the mother.
2778080	2779080	Except you get shafted.
2779080	2780080	But from the other end.
2780080	2781080	They said bacteria.
2781080	2784080	So there's bacteria from the mother.
2784080	2785080	Mother who is...
2785080	2786080	That helps them digest...
2786080	2788080	Oh, right.
2788080	2791080	Because they're marsupials.
2791080	2792080	All right.
2792080	2795080	So this might have been kind of a dud.
2795080	2796080	Wait.
2796080	2797080	No.
2797080	2798080	Do you know anything about Doritos?
2798080	2799080	Yeah.
2799080	2801080	I have all these Dorito issues.
2801080	2802080	Could you explain the difference
2802080	2804080	between the yellow bag and the orange bag to us?
2804080	2805080	Yes.
2805080	2806080	Because one says like nacho cheese,
2806080	2807080	but the other says cheese supreme.
2807080	2808080	We have different ones.
2808080	2813080	I think they might be labeled differently.
2813080	2816080	So let's start with cheese supreme.
2816080	2818080	Okay.
2818080	2820080	So obviously, that's the best.
2820080	2821080	That's standard, right?
2821080	2822080	That's the good one?
2822080	2823080	No, no.
2823080	2825080	The standard, like the one that they started with
2825080	2826080	was nacho cheese.
2826080	2827080	Right.
2827080	2829080	And then they amped it up with cheese supreme.
2829080	2830080	Right.
2830080	2831080	But what's the difference?
2831080	2832080	Because I had a nacho cheese,
2832080	2833080	and I would say it sounded like,
2833080	2835080	or it tasted like Cool Ranch,
2835080	2838080	or I think it's called Cool American.
2838080	2840080	Oh, they call it Cool Ranch here.
2840080	2841080	That's the blue one.
2841080	2842080	You're like, you've got a whole different color.
2842080	2843080	That's how it tasted though.
2843080	2847080	It tasted like it, mate.
2847080	2851080	That sounded really insulting when I said it.
2851080	2853080	Listen here, mate.
2853080	2855080	You don't be throwing different colors at me.
2855080	2856080	It's true.
2856080	2857080	We talking red and yellow.
2857080	2858080	You talking blue.
2858080	2859080	I'm talking true blue.
2859080	2860080	True Bluetooth.
2860080	2863080	Fair dinkum.
2863080	2864080	Okay.
2864080	2865080	So you do have the Cool Ranch,
2865080	2868080	but the nacho cheese just tastes half like Cool Ranch
2868080	2869080	and half like cheese.
2869080	2870080	Nacho cheese.
2870080	2873080	Nacho cheese.
2873080	2877080	I would say that the nacho cheese tasted more like ranch
2877080	2879080	than nacho cheese.
2879080	2882080	And the cheese supreme tasted like nacho cheesier,
2882080	2883080	is what we call it.
2883080	2885080	We don't really have ranch over here,
2885080	2887080	so like that's a whole new flavor.
2887080	2888080	But you have the blue bin.
2888080	2889080	We're talking about it.
2889080	2890080	You know about it.
2890080	2891080	We have it.
2891080	2893080	It's just that Australians are kind of stupid
2893080	2894080	when it comes to ranch.
2894080	2895080	They don't know what it is.
2895080	2897080	Ranch is terrible.
2897080	2899080	I would never eat ranch willingly.
2899080	2901080	The sauce, not the chip.
2901080	2903080	And that's why you go cheese supreme, eh?
2903080	2904080	Right, yeah.
2904080	2905080	Nacho cheesier.
2905080	2908080	If it's cheesier, then why isn't it more nacho-ier?
2908080	2909080	That's what I don't get.
2909080	2912080	It's like the cheesier is less nacho-y than the nacho cheese.
2912080	2914080	Well, I guess that does make sense.
2915080	2919080	They had to sacrifice the spicy for the cheese.
2919080	2920080	Right.
2920080	2922080	We got both in America, baby.
2922080	2923080	It's a Venn diagram.
2923080	2926080	So the more cheese you get, the less nacho you have.
2926080	2927080	Right.
2927080	2929080	So ours is the best of both worlds.
2929080	2930080	We really win.
2930080	2931080	Is it true?
2931080	2933080	Well, in America, I don't know if you know this,
2933080	2936080	but an adult has to eat Cool Ranch
2936080	2938080	and then shit in a baby's mouth
2938080	2941080	because there's a bacteria that only Americans have
2941080	2945080	that helps the baby digest the nacho cheese.
2945080	2948080	But you guys don't do that here, apparently.
2948080	2949080	No, no.
2949080	2950080	We do that with shrimp.
2950080	2951080	Oh.
2951080	2952080	Oh, shit.
2952080	2953080	Right.
2953080	2954080	It's...
2954080	2955080	Oh, shit.
2955080	2958080	It's prawn in Queensland, for God's sake.
2958080	2960080	Even I know that.
2960080	2961080	What was it?
2961080	2962080	What was it?
2962080	2963080	Darcy?
2963080	2964080	Darcy?
2964080	2965080	Darcy.
2965080	2966080	Let's have a hand for Darcy.
2966080	2967080	Darcy!
2967080	2968080	Hit it.
2968080	2969080	Koala expert.
2969080	2970080	Koala expert Darcy.
2970080	2971080	Koala expert Darcy.
2971080	2974080	All of its dorino expertise as well.
2974080	2975080	I feel like there's got to...
2975080	2977080	Can we engineer something?
2977080	2979080	We've got a crowd of a particular personality.
2979080	2981080	They have a dynamic...
2981080	2984080	I'm going to call that personality Prison Riot.
2984080	2985080	It's fine.
2985080	2986080	That's fine.
2986080	2987080	Like...
2987080	2988080	Fuck it.
2988080	2990080	Please don't kill us.
2990080	2993080	I think there's a way to use that energy better than like...
2993080	2996080	We don't have to do an NPR podcast.
2996080	2997080	Naked Dodgeball!
2997080	2999080	Naked Dodgeball!
2999080	3006080	I'm going to try this just to see if this works.
3006080	3011080	I'm going to do a little one-man improv.
3011080	3018080	When you see me pause and go like this, that means I'm going to get a suggestion from you.
3018080	3022080	I think this will work because you guys like yelling stuff out.
3022080	3024080	Oh, I'm going in the door.
3024080	3025080	Oh, look.
3025080	3026080	It's a...
3026080	3028080	Yeah, this is great.
3028080	3034080	Well, it's a thing.
3034080	3035080	That's good.
3035080	3036080	That's great.
3036080	3037080	Koala pen.
3037080	3038080	Oh, look.
3038080	3041080	It's a dildo tire.
3041080	3046080	I'll just put that on my car so that I can...
3046080	3047080	Whoo!
3047080	3048080	Whoo!
3048080	3050080	There's a police officer.
3050080	3052080	Is that a dildo on your tire?
3052080	3053080	Yes.
3053080	3056080	I'm using it to fuck traffic.
3056080	3060080	So I can drive better on the thing.
3060080	3063080	Forgive me to understand what I do for a living.
3063080	3065080	It's very important I get to work soon.
3065080	3067080	What do you do for a living, sir?
3067080	3070080	I'm a peanut allergist.
3070080	3072080	All right.
3072080	3073080	On you go.
3073080	3074080	On you go.
3074080	3075080	There are children's lives on the line.
3075080	3076080	On you go.
3076080	3077080	Dildo car.
3077080	3078080	Dildo car.
3078080	3080080	Driving to my work.
3080080	3082080	That's a copyright, right?
3082080	3083080	Okay.
3083080	3086080	Here I am at the peanut allergies science research center.
3086080	3089080	I better go talk to my boss.
3089080	3090080	Hello.
3090080	3092080	I'm reporting for duty.
3092080	3094080	Are there any emergencies I should know about?
3094080	3095080	No.
3095080	3097080	This is nonstandard procedure for your day-to-day.
3097080	3100080	You have reports and e-mails to deal with.
3100080	3101080	What are you doing?
3101080	3105080	I got pulled over by the police and I just...
3105080	3106080	Oh, right.
3106080	3107080	Of course.
3107080	3111080	I just want to do my best to try to keep kids from dying of peanut allergies.
3111080	3112080	Oh, shit.
3112080	3113080	Hello.
3113080	3115080	Drumroll strike happening.
3115080	3116080	Hello?
3116080	3117080	Hello.
3117080	3118080	Can I speak to Dan Harmon?
3118080	3119080	Is this the police?
3119080	3120080	Yes.
3120080	3121080	Okay.
3121080	3122080	Here he is.
3122080	3124080	Sir, we found your car and there's a...
3124080	3125080	Goanna.
3125080	3127080	There's a goanna on it.
3127080	3128080	Oh, no.
3128080	3133080	That's like three bananas in one.
3133080	3135080	Yes, sir.
3135080	3138080	You have three bananas in your car.
3138080	3139080	Why is it...
3139080	3141080	It's being impounded.
3141080	3142080	All right.
3142080	3144080	Well, I'll come down to the impound lot right away.
3144080	3150080	And since I shouldn't use my now street illegal car, I'm going to use my...
3150080	3153080	My 9-11.
3153080	3155080	My 9-11.
3155080	3157080	I'm going to use my 9-11.
3157080	3168080	I'll put one fallen tower on each foot and use them as stilts to stride across the downunder.
3168080	3169080	Whoo!
3169080	3170080	Whoo!
3170080	3171080	Oh, no.
3171080	3172080	God damn it.
3172080	3174080	I thought for sure I had such a legal way to travel.
3174080	3179080	Sir, are you trying to drive down the street in a culturally insensitive fashion?
3179080	3182080	Well, I won't tell you I'm on walkabout.
3182080	3184080	Apparently, that's even worse.
3184080	3187080	What are you from Ipswich?
3187080	3191080	Yes, my name is Pauline Henson.
3191080	3197080	I'm a liberal.
3197080	3200080	I'm riddled with chlamydia right now.
3200080	3204080	If you could please, I need to get to the impound lot.
3204080	3207080	Here, I'll loan you my...
3214080	3215080	I heard dick talk.
3215080	3218080	I'll loan you my piss flaps.
3218080	3221080	Sir, these are heirloom piss flaps.
3221080	3227080	These piss flaps were handed down by my great-grandmother from her great-grandmother.
3227080	3229080	From her great-great-grandmother.
3229080	3230080	Sir, I appreciate it.
3230080	3232080	Thank you for giving me your piss flaps.
3232080	3233080	Thank you.
3233080	3234080	I will honor and cherish it.
3234080	3235080	Use them wisely.
3235080	3239080	But three words of warning.
3239080	3242080	Don't use the piss flaps after midnight.
3242080	3245080	Don't feed the piss flaps.
3245080	3247080	And strangely, don't get them wet.
3247080	3248080	Oh, yeah.
3248080	3250080	All right.
3250080	3251080	Thank you.
3251080	3252080	Thank you.
3252080	3253080	I'm putting them on.
3253080	3254080	Ah!
3254080	3255080	Fuck!
3255080	3256080	There's a Huntsman!
3256080	3257080	Ah!
3257080	3258080	Ah!
3258080	3259080	Huntsman tape!
3259080	3260080	Oh!
3260080	3261080	Classic!
3261080	3262080	Classic!
3262080	3263080	All right.
3263080	3265080	Well, we tried using them to yell out things that way.
3265080	3266080	Yeah, we did it.
3266080	3267080	That was a little improv experiment.
3267080	3268080	I thought that worked out pretty nicely.
3268080	3269080	Good job.
3269080	3270080	You guys did really good.
3270080	3272080	You like yelling stuff out.
3272080	3274080	Maybe we should go meet individuals.
3274080	3278080	Maybe if they're meeting them as individuals, then they're like yelling things out.
3278080	3282080	You don't think the insane mob rule thing is working right now?
3282080	3286080	I just want them to be, you know, just want to like adapt and be happy.
3286080	3291080	When you suggested that, I heard someone audibly gasp.
3291080	3293080	Yeah, because maybe they...
3293080	3294080	All right.
3294080	3295080	You got kind of derailed earlier.
3295080	3297080	You had a friend who lost their toe.
3297080	3300080	And then we went to the back row guy because he yelled out back row.
3300080	3301080	What's your name?
3301080	3302080	I'm Louise.
3302080	3303080	Louise?
3303080	3304080	Okay.
3304080	3305080	How do you know when you're finished?
3305080	3306080	All right.
3306080	3307080	Working the crowd.
3307080	3308080	All right.
3308080	3309080	Hip switch.
3309080	3310080	Hip switch.
3310080	3311080	All right.
3311080	3314080	What's your name, young lady?
3314080	3315080	Mel.
3315080	3316080	Mel?
3316080	3317080	Ha.
3317080	3321080	More like, more like, more like Mel.
3321080	3322080	All right.
3322080	3325080	Well, I'm in the back, Jeff.
3325080	3329080	Dan, what can you tell us in the back row right now?
3329080	3333080	Oh, everyone's real handsome back here.
3334080	3341080	And the audio is on just a slight delay, so I'm confusing myself by talking.
3341080	3345280	You know how it was like children's exhibits at a discovery museum where you talk into
3345280	3348080	the phone and it's on a little bit of a delay?
3348080	3349080	That's interesting.
3349080	3352080	That's why all the chairs are pointing this way and this is where the stage is.
3352080	3353080	Oh.
3353080	3354080	You don't think I could do the show from back here?
3354080	3356080	I'd like to see you try it.
3356080	3357080	Not even if you give me...
3357080	3360080	I dare you, Dan, to go out to that back door.
3360080	3361080	Oh, thank you.
3361080	3362080	You're getting a drink?
3362080	3363080	What's happening?
3363080	3366080	She gave me a sticker that says, You're Awesome.
3366080	3371080	Dan, Dan, walk out one of those back doors and there's a staircase.
3371080	3374080	You can go up into the balcony up there with the balcony people.
3374080	3375080	Okay.
3375080	3377080	You really think this wireless mic's gonna...
3377080	3378080	Hey, Jeff, do we got...
3378080	3379080	Oh, is it Rio?
3379080	3380080	Rio, do we have lights for the balcony or no?
3380080	3381080	Are there house lights up there?
3381080	3382080	Oh, there we are.
3382080	3383080	Fuck yeah.
3383080	3384080	Okay.
3384080	3385080	I think I'm...
3385080	3386080	Can you still hear me, Jeff?
3386080	3387080	Yeah, you sound great, Dan.
3387080	3388080	Okay.
3388080	3389080	You're doing great.
3389080	3391080	I like this staircase, mate.
3392080	3393080	This is...
3393080	3396080	Our show has completely gone tits up.
3396080	3397080	Oh, my God.
3397080	3398080	Oh, my God.
3398080	3399080	There's just a bunch of people up.
3399080	3401080	They're gonna kick my ass.
3401080	3403080	They don't even have chairs, most of them.
3403080	3406080	They look hungry for human flesh.
3406080	3407080	How are you guys?
3407080	3409080	Are you enjoying the show?
3409080	3410080	Now, everybody...
3410080	3412080	You just call yourselves collectively...
3412080	3413080	Dan, I...
3413080	3415080	The balcony people, they say.
3415080	3420080	Balcony people right now, what Dan hasn't told you, in one of Dan's pockets is 100
3421080	3422080	American dollars.
3423080	3426080	In another pocket, Huntsman Spider.
3429080	3430080	Well, no.
3430080	3431080	See, they're not lethal.
3431080	3432080	You tried to...
3432080	3433080	Yes, sir.
3433080	3434080	You're Australian?
3434080	3436080	You're gonna say cunt more.
3436080	3437080	I have to...
3438080	3440080	He has to say cunt more.
3440080	3443080	I don't know if you can hear me, Jeff, but I've just been told I need to say cunt more
3443080	3445080	in order to sound Australian.
3445080	3446080	Dan, you're a great cunt.
3446080	3448080	You should say cunt as much as possible.
3451080	3452080	Hi!
3453080	3456080	There's some street humor going on up here.
3458080	3461080	His friend next to him said I'm not a cunt because I don't taste good or something.
3461080	3462080	All right.
3462080	3463080	All right.
3463080	3464080	All right.
3464080	3465080	Well, oh, thank you, sir.
3465080	3466080	What's your name?
3466080	3467080	Elliot.
3467080	3468080	Elliot's back here.
3468080	3470080	Phone home, you know what I'm saying?
3470080	3471080	You gave me a drink.
3471080	3474080	That's the 80s reference that nobody knows.
3474080	3475080	What do you think, Jeff?
3475080	3478080	If you give me, like, a beat, like, do you think I'll be...
3478080	3481080	Even though it's on a delay, it might be hard for me to...
3481080	3483080	Spencer's got a beat for us.
3483080	3485080	We're gonna lay a Spencer beat down.
3486080	3488080	Are you gonna do some balcony rapping?
3488080	3489080	What kind of vodka is this?
3489080	3490080	I know that...
3490080	3493080	I tried the butter vodka here, the triple six.
3493080	3494080	What is this?
3494080	3496080	They have butter flavored vodka.
3497080	3498080	What is it?
3499080	3500080	No.
3500080	3501080	Okay.
3502080	3504080	It's just the well, the well vodka.
3504080	3505080	Dan, you ready for a beat?
3505080	3506080	Yeah.
3506080	3509080	I might be off, but it'll be because there's a delay.
3509080	3510080	Oh, yeah.
3510080	3512080	It won't be because I'm bad at rapping.
3512080	3513080	Is that working?
3513080	3515080	I don't think it's coming through right.
3515080	3517080	Take the case off.
3517080	3518080	There is no case.
3518080	3519080	Yeah, it's not a block in it.
3519080	3520080	There it is.
3523080	3524080	Yeah.
3524080	3525080	Yeah.
3526080	3528080	I like that hat mic.
3529080	3531080	I like that hot mic.
3531080	3532080	Yeah.
3532080	3536080	It's true, true blue, the fair dinkum.
3536080	3539080	I fucked your mama in the kitchen sinkum.
3539080	3542080	I fucked your mama down under.
3542080	3545080	I fucked your mama with the lightning and the thunder.
3545080	3546080	Am I offbeat?
3546080	3548080	I can't tell.
3548080	3551080	I'm gonna come back down the stairs.
3551080	3554080	I like that hat mic.
3554080	3557080	I like that hat mic.
3557080	3559080	I like that hat mic.
3559080	3562080	I fucked your mama for a pair of roller skates.

3571080	3574080	I fucked your mama so hard, shut down her kidneys.
3574080	3577080	I fucked your mama across the outback.
3577080	3583080	I fucked your mama and she's a throwback to a time when our beds were burning.
3583080	3585080	I fucked your mama so hard, she stopped learning.
3585080	3588080	A disability is what I gave her.
3588080	3591080	I fucked your mama in the fur.
3591080	3592080	Phew.
3592080	3594080	That was gross.
3612080	3615080	I fucked your mama real good.
3615080	3618080	I fucked your mama like you should.
3618080	3621080	I fucked your mama in Australia.
3621080	3622080	I fucked your mama.
3622080	3624080	I can live to tell the tale of ya.
3624080	3627080	Yo, I fucked your mama in Tasmania.
3627080	3630080	I fucked your mama in Hulkamania.
3630080	3632080	I fucked the iron sheep.
3632080	3635080	I fucked your mama every day of the motherfucking week.
3635080	3638080	Huntsman's fighter, fangs go deep.
3638080	3640080	I fucked your mama.
3640080	3641080	I fucked her sheep.
3641080	3644080	I fucked your mama in Queensland.
3644080	3647080	I fucked your mama in Queensland.
3647080	3651080	I gotta learn more Australian states before we go to the next one.
3651080	3653080	Here's South Wales.
3653080	3655080	South Wales.
3655080	3659080	Yeah.
3659080	3660080	Sales.
3660080	3661080	Jewelry.
3661080	3662080	Do they have those?
3662080	3664080	All right.
3664080	3665080	Australian rap.
3665080	3667080	Australian rap.
3667080	3668080	Australian.
3668080	3670080	I like that hat.
3670080	3671080	Australian rap.

3676080	3679080	The cargo shorts and the funny hat.
3679080	3681080	The clever girl.
3681080	3683080	The clever girl.
3683080	3685080	Is that your guys' favorite character?
3685080	3689080	The clever girl guy from Jurassic Park?
3689080	3690080	All right, Jeff.
3690080	3691080	I'm out of breath.
3691080	3701080	You know, they say that the water spins a different way down the drain
3701080	3703080	in the northern hemisphere in the southern.
3703080	3709080	Dan is just as good at rapping down here as he is up there.
3709080	3712080	And that guy gave me vodka, but it's like, I have top shelf vodka down on stage,
3712080	3715080	but then he, yeah.
3715080	3716080	You okay?
3716080	3717080	No.
3717080	3718080	She's just crying.
3718080	3719080	I don't care.
3719080	3722080	I'm 43 and I eat bacon every meal.
3722080	3724080	And I just walked more than I've ever walked in my life.
3724080	3725080	My watch was beeping.
3725080	3730080	My Apple watch was going like, you've met every goal ever.
3730080	3731080	Now breathe.
3731080	3732080	Breathe.
3732080	3737080	You have 20 e-mails.
3737080	3740080	Jesus Christ, Jeff.
3740080	3741080	I've got to get it.
3741080	3742080	I've got to work out.
3742080	3744080	I've got to like, I've got to get fucking better.
3744080	3746080	I've got to get better in shape.
3746080	3747080	Yeah.
3747080	3749080	I was just going to say, you get click cookies.
3749080	3750080	Click cookies?
3750080	3751080	Yeah.
3751080	3752080	While you're...
3752080	3753080	While you're...
3753080	3754080	Oh, ellipticking.
3754080	3755080	Yeah.
3755080	3758080	Anybody cookie collecting in Australia?
3758080	3759080	Cookie collector, too?
3759080	3760080	Okay, good.
3760080	3761080	All right.
3761080	3763080	I'm going to fucking die, Jeff.
3763080	3766080	I'm going to die on stage in Brisbane, Australia.
3766080	3767080	It's all right.
3767080	3770080	It'll be like a special moment for all of us.
3770080	3774080	The Australian military invented Wi-Fi.
3774080	3776080	You're welcome.
3776080	3777080	No.
3777080	3778080	Thank you.
3778080	3779080	No.
3779080	3786080	It was all women?
3786080	3788080	No, I'm sure there's a woman in front of me.
3788080	3789080	What did you say?
3789080	3791080	Yeah, a woman did it.
3791080	3793080	Oh, what did you say, though?
3793080	3794080	It's all right.
3794080	3795080	A woman that did it.
3795080	3796080	Yeah.
3796080	3797080	Sorry, Siro.
3797080	3799080	Siro is the organization.
3799080	3800080	Right.
3800080	3804080	Somebody about women over here.
3804080	3806080	Let's all break up into small discussion groups.
3806080	3807080	Yeah.
3807080	3809080	She's going to explain Wi-Fi to us.
3809080	3810080	We're going to pass our microphones.
3810080	3814080	We can all do our own podcasts.
3814080	3815080	All right.
3815080	3818080	I love how communal and fucking nuts this place is.
3818080	3824080	It's like you're at a weird family dinner where everybody is a sibling that maybe hates
3824080	3826080	the other people.
3826080	3827080	I think, Jeff...
3827080	3828080	No, no.
3828080	3831080	We're going to Melbourne tomorrow, and they hate Sydney, and Sydney hates Melbourne, and
3831080	3832080	everybody hates you guys.
3832080	3833080	It's all fucking...
3833080	3834080	What?
3834080	3835080	What?
3835080	3836080	Yeah.
3836080	3840080	We haven't heard anybody say they hate Brisbane yet, except this is our first stop.
3841080	3845080	When you had your little hat on, I wanted to call you what I've heard people call this
3845080	3846080	place.
3846080	3847080	I want to call you Big Country.
3847080	3848080	Big Country.
3848080	3851080	It's a big country town.
3851080	3855080	That's not an insult.
3855080	3858080	That guy is mad that it wasn't an insult.
3858080	3861080	Okay, and fuck yourself.
3861080	3864080	I don't know.
3865080	3870080	Jeff, I think that I have a new, now another experiment to do with the audience.
3870080	3871080	I love this.
3871080	3872080	This has never been done before.
3872080	3874080	Now that you've regained your breath.
3874080	3881080	I think that you and I should do a little scene, but we should have one of the Brisbaneites
3881080	3882080	provide...
3882080	3884080	This has never been done before.
3884080	3890080	If they were to provide some form of sound effects using their mouth and their microphone
3890080	3892080	alone while we do an improv scene.
3892080	3897080	So we do a scene and we make them do the noises that would be required in the scene.
3897080	3903080	So we collaborate together in a scene that is constructed in front of their very eyes.
3903080	3904080	How about that?
3904080	3907080	Madam here who knows about science and knows about stuff.
3907080	3910080	Would you come up and help us out?
3923080	3924080	Kate Kite.
3924080	3926080	I like your kite, mate.
3926080	3928080	All right, Kate.
3928080	3929080	Thanks, dude.
3929080	3931080	Okay, so you're going to...
3931080	3935080	Jeff and I are going to do a little scene and it's going to take place in...
3935080	3937080	In Australia.
3937080	3939080	Somewhere in Australia.
3939080	3949080	In a brothel, an Australian brothel.
3949080	3951080	Australian brothel.
3952080	3954080	Kate, you're going to do all the sound effects.
3954080	3955080	So let's just walk you through that.
3955080	3958080	I'm going to open a door.
3958080	3959080	All right.
3959080	3960080	All right.
3960080	3965080	I'm going to punch a duck.
3965080	3966080	Perfect.
3966080	3968080	Wow.
3968080	3971080	Kate is on the fucking scene, everybody.
3971080	3973080	The quack.
3973080	3977080	That is the sound that makes when you punch a duck, the quack.
3977080	3978080	All right.
3978080	3980080	I thought the door opening could use a little...
3981080	3982080	Okay.
3982080	3983080	All right.
3983080	3984080	And here we go.
3984080	3985080	Here we go.
3985080	3987080	Australian brothel.
3995080	3996080	Hello?
3996080	3997080	Ah, good morning, sir.
3997080	3998080	Good morning.
3998080	4000080	Oh, I was about to ring the little bell on your desk.
4000080	4002080	Well, if you'd like to ring the bell, go ahead.
4002080	4003080	Well, now that you're here...
4003080	4004080	No, no.
4004080	4007080	It's actually customary for the customers to ring the bell.
4007080	4009080	I'm just the footman.
4010080	4011080	Ding, ding.
4012080	4013080	Steve.
4013080	4014080	Can I help you?
4014080	4015080	Yes.
4015080	4019080	I would like the services of a prostitute, please.
4020080	4023080	Well, let me go into my computer.
4023080	4024080	Let me just start it up.
4024080	4025080	The computer's been turned off.
4025080	4027080	I'll start my computer up.
4027080	4029080	Ding, ding, ding, ding.
4029080	4030080	Oh.
4030080	4033080	You're using Windows 93?
4033080	4034080	Yes.
4034080	4036080	I have an old school modem.
4036080	4038080	Let me start doing it.
4039080	4040080	Oh, God.
4040080	4042080	I thought Wi-Fi was invented down here.
4042080	4043080	Oh.
4043080	4046080	I wonder if I have any male.
4046080	4047080	Ding.
4048080	4050080	I have one male.
4050080	4053080	Would you like a male prostitute or a female prostitute?
4053080	4055080	I have one male.
4055080	4060080	No cisgender heteronormative binary prejudices for me.
4060080	4063080	Ah, you would like our potpourri prostitutes.
4063080	4065080	Give me the grab bag.
4065080	4067080	I'll take whatever, whoever you recommend.
4067080	4068080	All right.
4068080	4071080	I will use my, you know how some people go when they go hunting.
4071080	4074080	They call a duck or they call a bull or whatever to go hunting.
4074080	4078080	We actually, we're very old-fashioned here in our Australian brothel.
4078080	4085080	I have a prostitute call that calls all of our possibly transgendered LGBT,
4085080	4087080	who knows what prostitutes.
4087080	4089080	Let me just blow on that right now.
4089080	4091080	Oi, get out of here.
4091080	4095080	Is that...
4095080	4098080	Yeah, bush pig.
4098080	4101080	Was that, was that, was that Paul Hogan?
4101080	4103080	That's not a prostitute.
4107080	4109080	I said, get out of here.
4109080	4110080	Oh, oh, oh.
4110080	4111080	Oh, it's like you're sideways.
4111080	4112080	Ah.
4112080	4114080	Here, he or she comes right now.
4114080	4118080	You can hear the high heels coming down the wooden staircase.
4118080	4119080	Ding, ding, ding.
4119080	4120080	Oh.
4120080	4121080	Oh, they fell down the...
4121080	4122080	Yes.
4122080	4124080	Sorry, she died.
4124080	4126080	I'm going to have to call...
4126080	4127080	She thought it was extra.
4127080	4131080	I'm going to have to call somebody else with my different prostitute call.
4131080	4134080	Hey, big tits, it's time for you.
4134080	4138080	Ah, you are very in luck, sir.
4138080	4141080	You got big tits.
4141080	4144080	Big tits.
4144080	4145080	Come on.
4145080	4146080	You can hear her getting ready upstairs.
4146080	4149080	She's got the hairdryer on.
4149080	4151080	She's got the...
4151080	4155080	She's also got the shaver because she's shaving her private areas.
4155080	4157080	Whoa.
4157080	4158080	She's doing it.
4158080	4160080	She's doing it Dundee style.
4160080	4162080	She's very ambidextrous.
4162080	4165080	I can't wait to meet her.
4165080	4166080	Walk with me, sir.
4166080	4168080	We'll walk you upstairs to big tits room.
4168080	4169080	All right.
4169080	4170080	Let's go up the stairs.
4170080	4171080	Be careful.
4171080	4172080	These stairs are very old.
4172080	4176080	And some say haunted by the ghost of old prostitutes.
4180080	4181080	Yeah.
4181080	4184080	Where's that cream for the thrush?
4188080	4190080	That's a yeast infection.
4192080	4193080	Did you?
4193080	4195080	It's ghost inside here, Margaret.
4195080	4197080	It's okay.
4197080	4198080	Ah, here we are.
4198080	4199080	I will leave you to it.
4199080	4202080	Just ring the bell and big tits will be right in to serve you, sir.
4202080	4203080	Okay, all right.
4203080	4205080	Well, I feel like I want to freshen up.
4205080	4208080	I'll use some of this mouth freshener.
4208080	4211080	Shh, shh.
4211080	4214080	Haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle.
4215080	4216080	All right.
4216080	4218080	Sir, if you're going to waste our mouth freshener,
4218080	4221080	that's going to cost you extra.
4221080	4225080	Well, here I have a lot of Australian coins here
4225080	4228080	that are worth any number of money.
4228080	4229080	Thank you, sir.
4229080	4230080	Just ring the bell.
4230080	4232080	Big tits will be right out.
4232080	4233080	Yeah.
4233080	4235080	You'll notice that when the bell rings,
4235080	4237080	it has kind of an enchanting sound.
4237080	4241080	I hope you enjoy it because it's the only bell in the house
4241080	4244080	that plays a Lady Gaga song when you ring the bell.
4249080	4251080	Poke, poke, poke a face.
4251080	4252080	It's a poke a face.
4252080	4255080	Poke a poke a face, motherfucker.
4258080	4261080	That's Lady Gaga as far as I know it.
4261080	4264080	That's about what I would have done.
4264080	4265080	All right.
4265080	4266080	Well, good.
4266080	4267080	You can say toe jam.
4267080	4268080	Oh, sir, sir.
4268080	4269080	I'm sorry.
4269080	4270080	One more thing.
4270080	4271080	Before you go in, before you meet big tits,
4271080	4273080	I would like to give you one thing.
4273080	4275080	These are my great, great grandmother's piss flaps.
4275080	4277080	I want you to have these.
4277080	4278080	Don't get them wet.
4278080	4279080	Don't see them.
4279080	4280080	Don't use them after midnight.
4280080	4281080	Screech, screech.
4281080	4282080	Oh, God.
4282080	4283080	Oh, oh, oh.
4283080	4284080	Just, okay.
4284080	4285080	That was the piss flaps.
4285080	4286080	Okay.
4286080	4287080	All right.
4287080	4288080	I think I'm supposed to just stand here.
4288080	4290080	I already rang the bell.
4290080	4293080	Oh, hello.
4293080	4295080	Big tits?
4295080	4296080	Can't you tell?
4296080	4299080	Hub it up, hub it up.
4299080	4302080	I can hear them when you shake.
4302080	4303080	Yes.
4303080	4304080	Yes.
4304080	4308080	Two of them just fell off.
4308080	4311080	Which is why I keep two on the back in reserve.
4311080	4312080	Whoa.
4312080	4313080	Yes.
4313080	4315080	I've swung them right back in front.
4315080	4316080	I'm like a shark's teeth.
4316080	4320080	They just keep reforming right in front.
4320080	4321080	Oh.
4322080	4325080	Also, I have a transformer in my vagina.
4327080	4331080	Well, I'm just going to put on my piss flaps.
4334080	4335080	Yes.
4343080	4346080	There's a little bit of Foley work in there.
4346080	4349080	Now, as this is an Australian brothel,
4349080	4352080	there is a couple of traditions that we do before we start.
4352080	4357080	First, I sing in high falsetto,
4357080	4359080	waltzing Matilda,
4359080	4361080	as I get undressed,
4361080	4364080	and all of my clothing is made of metal.
4380080	4381080	You're supposed to be singing.
4381080	4382080	I'm just doing the music.
4382080	4383080	Yeah.
4383080	4384080	That's a good point.
4384080	4387080	Like, why would you even...
4387080	4389080	You said you were going to sing.
4395080	4397080	Listen, I'm glad you came up here.
4397080	4400080	I've been trying to get out of this brothel for a long time.
4401080	4403080	There's only one way out of here.
4403080	4404080	My jet pack.
4406080	4407080	Jesus.
4408080	4410080	Shit, it just flew off without us.
4411080	4412080	We're trapped here.
4413080	4416080	Fucking... Fucking Ipswich jet packs.
4418080	4419080	Listen to me.
4421080	4422080	I'm here to save you.
4422080	4424080	I've been undercover the whole time.
4424080	4426080	I have a grappling gun.
4426080	4429080	I'm from the Australian version of the CIA.
4430080	4431080	The AIC?
4431080	4432080	Yes.
4432080	4433080	ISIS.
4434080	4435080	ISIS?
4436080	4437080	You're from ISIS?
4437080	4438080	Yes.
4438080	4439080	You're from ISIS?
4439080	4440080	Yes.
4440080	4441080	Everything's backwards down here.
4441080	4442080	All right.
4442080	4443080	What?
4443080	4444080	ISIS is the CIA.
4444080	4445080	What?
4445080	4446080	Liberals are labor.
4446080	4447080	It's...
4447080	4448080	God damn it.
4448080	4450080	Men wear piss flaps.
4450080	4452080	Japanese Kim was a hit.
4452080	4453080	What's that?
4454080	4455080	All right.
4455080	4456080	Grappling gun.
4459080	4461080	That's a machine gun, sir.
4462080	4464080	I'm shooting a hole in the ceiling now.
4464080	4465080	Grappling gun.
4466080	4467080	Oh, shit.
4467080	4468080	Oh, pretend you're not here.
4468080	4469080	That's the door.
4470080	4471080	Yes?
4473080	4474080	What's happening in there?
4474080	4476080	I'm the footman again.
4476080	4477080	Nothing.
4477080	4479080	Just having a great time with sex.
4479080	4480080	Okay, it's fine.
4480080	4483080	I'll go back to playing my accordion.
4488080	4490080	Fucking piece of shit accordion.
4490080	4491080	Okay, good.
4491080	4492080	The closest thing.
4492080	4493080	The closest thing.
4493080	4494080	All right.
4494080	4495080	You shot a hole on the window now.
4495080	4497080	Now, I'm going to use the grappling gun for real.
4497080	4498080	Okay.
4498080	4501080	When I pull the trigger, it's going to make a grappling gun sound.
4501080	4505080	And it's going to shoot up and latch on to the edge of the hole that I made with the
4505080	4506080	machine gun.
4506080	4510080	And then I'm going to press a button on the side of the gun that's going to winch us both
4510080	4511080	up to the thing.
4511080	4512080	Okay.
4512080	4513080	Can I bring my violin?
4513080	4514080	Yes.
4514080	4515080	Okay.
4516080	4517080	All right.
4517080	4519080	Here we go.
4523080	4525080	You're the dude.
4531080	4532080	Kate, everybody.
4532080	4533080	Kate.
4533080	4536080	Jesus Christ.
4537080	4538080	That's how you fucking do it.
4538080	4539080	She knows.
4539080	4540080	I'm pretty sweaty.
4540080	4541080	Do you want to?
4541080	4542080	Oh, thank you.
4542080	4543080	Thank you.
4543080	4546080	I had Kate in my hand and went right into her armpit.
4546080	4547080	Right up in the armpit.
4547080	4548080	They call that.
4548080	4550080	They call that a…
4550080	4552080	Yes, at least it wasn't your piss buff.
4552080	4553080	Thank you, Kate.
4553080	4555080	When I like it up…
4555080	4556080	You know what?
4556080	4559080	When we leave Brisbane tomorrow, I'm going to look back on this.
4559080	4562080	The one thing I love about this town is everybody's so shy.
4562080	4563080	Yeah.
4563080	4567080	Once they came out of their shells, we really started having a good time, I think.
4567080	4571080	She knows everything about the internet, but then she's like Michael Winslow, too.
4571080	4573080	Like, she's a great…
4573080	4574080	You know, those don't usually go together.
4574080	4577080	She also just took the spoon out of the ice and was making like woodpeckers.
4577080	4580080	She really knew what she was doing.
4580080	4581080	I travel with Ryan Stiles.
4581080	4586080	Ryan Stiles is not as funny as Kate.
4586080	4587080	Kate, what do you do for a living?
4587080	4589080	What's your game?
4589080	4593080	I'm a media officer at a university, so I tell good research stories.
4593080	4598080	You're a media officer at a university, and you tell good research stories.
4598080	4599080	So did you hear about the Crown of Thorns?
4599080	4601080	Kate, sit the fuck down.
4601080	4602080	I'm kidding.
4602080	4606080	I'm kidding, of course, Kate.
4606080	4609080	Did you hear on the interwebs about the Crown of Thorns killing Starfish?
4609080	4610080	Oh, I love this joke.
4610080	4611080	The Crown of Thorns…
4611080	4612080	No, no, no.
4612080	4613080	It's for reals.
4613080	4614080	The Crown of Thorns-style killing what?
4614080	4617080	Yeah, so my university built a robot to kill Crown of Thorns Starfish because they're
4617080	4618080	eating the Great Barrier Reef.
4618080	4619080	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4619080	4620080	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4620080	4621080	I got that story out.
4621080	4622080	You got it out.
4622080	4623080	Yeah.
4623080	4624080	I didn't do the research.
4624080	4625080	I just told the world.
4625080	4629080	I've seen the time-lapse, like, underwater footage of the Crown of Thorns guys just eating
4629080	4630080	every goddamn thing up.
4630080	4631080	Yeah.
4631080	4632080	Yeah.
4632080	4633080	And then, so you made a…
4633080	4634080	Or you didn't make…
4634080	4637080	My roboticists, our roboticists did, yeah.
4637080	4639080	So they built a robot to kill them.
4639080	4641080	Just a robot that kills all the Starfish?
4641080	4643080	You have a Starfish killing robot?
4643080	4645080	Yes, we do, technically.
4645080	4650080	But, no, we're changing it into, from the COTS bot, Crown of Thorns killing robot, to
4650080	4653080	the Ranger bot, which will be a multi-purpose, multi-function, all…
4653080	4654080	See it?
4654080	4656080	No, not killing machine.
4656080	4659080	Reef monitoring tool, so…
4659080	4660080	Fucking amazing.
4660080	4661080	Right.
4661080	4663080	You don't think the singularity is going to happen?
4663080	4667080	You have 10 seconds to comply Starfish.
4668080	4669080	You modified…
4669080	4674080	So it killed all the Crown of Thorns Starfish, and then you're like, well, let's just
4674080	4675080	give it sentience.
4675080	4677080	Yeah, you know what?
4677080	4680080	Fucking Octopus has been bumming me out for a while.
4680080	4682080	Let's kill those motherfuckers, too.
4682080	4683080	They have a brain.
4683080	4684080	We can't do that.
4684080	4685080	What does the robot look like?
4685080	4689080	What does the business end of a Starfish killing robot look like?
4689080	4691080	Are you looking it up right now?
4691080	4692080	What?
4692080	4694080	Are you looking up right now?
4694080	4696080	No, I'm looking at my notes.
4696080	4697080	Oh, yeah.
4697080	4698080	That's the show.
4698080	4699080	That's the show.
4699080	4700080	It's a…
4700080	4701080	Dance looking at incest porn.
4701080	4707080	It's a meet along yellow penis shaped thing with a couple of side bars and like a keel
4707080	4708080	on top.
4708080	4709080	Alright.
4709080	4712080	That's the only way I can finish.
4712080	4715080	The only way I can fish.
4715080	4716080	Wow.
4716080	4719080	I hate when the audience is funnier than us.
4719080	4724080	So your Starfish killing robot has a big yellowish penis looking thing on it?
4724080	4725080	No, no, it is.
4725080	4729080	It's a phallic kind of meter long tube submarine.
4729080	4730080	What's it do?
4730080	4731080	Did it tromp them or suck them in?
4731080	4735080	Well, it's got a world's first injection system that's…
4735080	4738080	What's the air pressure one?
4738080	4741080	That's the oldest come on I've ever heard about.
4741080	4742080	Hey, ladies.
4742080	4744080	You want to meet the oldest injection system?
4744080	4749080	It's a pneumatic injection system and it injects the Starfish with bile salts.
4749080	4750080	Bile salts?
4750080	4751080	Yes.
4751080	4752080	They get it from an ox.
4752080	4755080	Yeah, so the Starfish don't like it because they don't have that kind of protein in their
4755080	4756080	body so they melt or something.
4756080	4757080	But does it knock them dead?
4757080	4758080	Yeah, yeah.
4758080	4760080	It melts them in about 24 hours.
4760080	4761080	Well, that sounds fucking excruciating.
4761080	4764080	Isn't there a more fucking humane way to kill these?
4764080	4765080	They're fucking Starfish.
4765080	4766080	That's right, yes.
4766080	4767080	Who cares?
4767080	4770080	It's the Great Barrier Reef, so…
4770080	4771080	Right.
4771080	4777080	So you work for a corporation that sends out a giant dick that melts Starfish.
4777080	4778080	It's public money.
4778080	4779080	It's a university.
4779080	4780080	Come on.
4781080	4782080	Good on you.
4782080	4783080	Yeah.
4783080	4784080	That was very Australian.
4784080	4785080	Good on you.
4785080	4786080	Australian engineering.
4786080	4787080	Well done.
4787080	4790080	We invented the internet and killer robot Starfish dicks.
4790080	4793080	And written on the side of it, it says, how's the serenity?
4793080	4795080	How's the serenity?
4795080	4798080	How's the serenity?
4798080	4800080	We did our research.
4800080	4801080	So much serenity.
4801080	4803080	How's the serenity?
4803080	4806080	They fucking melt Starfish by injecting them with poison.
4806080	4808080	You can inject them with anything, really, right?
4808080	4811080	I mean, like, if you inject someone with, like, milk, you'd kill them.
4811080	4813080	Like, I don't know.
4813080	4814080	You could just put, like…
4814080	4815080	Air.
4815080	4816080	You could probably inject them with air.
4816080	4817080	Yeah.
4817080	4818080	Like, it's pneumatic.
4818080	4819080	Fuck them right up.
4819080	4820080	Just, like, if I…
4820080	4825080	And I'm not going to, but if I stuck a huge robot dick into you and just pumped air into
4825080	4826080	you, you'd die, I'd say.
4826080	4827080	Oh, yeah.
4827080	4828080	Big time.
4828080	4829080	But I think these Starfish, they're more robust.
4829080	4830080	They're a more robust enemy.
4830080	4832080	They're, like, barnacles or liberals.
4832080	4836080	You can get it.
4836080	4837080	Give me a…
4837080	4838080	Give me a…
4838080	4839080	Give me a ballad.
4839080	4840080	Let's do a song, like a…
4840080	4841080	Not a rapper.
4841080	4842080	Perfect.
4842080	4843080	Oh, it doesn't do that.
4843080	4844080	What was that?
4844080	4845080	Thank you, sir.
4845080	4846080	I like your hair, mate.
4846080	4847080	All right.
4847080	4848080	What do you want, Dan?
4848080	4849080	Just give me, like, a…
4849080	4850080	Like, you know, something that's more emotional.
4850080	4851080	Okay.
4851080	4852080	Let's see what we got here.
4852080	4853080	Oh, yeah.
4853080	4854080	Oh, yeah.
4854080	4855080	Oh, yeah.
4855080	4856080	Oh, yeah.
4856080	4857080	Oh, yeah.
4857080	4858080	Oh, yeah.
4858080	4859080	Oh, yeah.
4859080	4860080	Oh, yeah.
4860080	4861080	Oh, yeah.
4861080	4862080	Oh, yeah.
4862080	4863080	Oh, yeah.
4863080	4864080	Oh, yeah.
4865080	4866080	Let's see what we got here.
4867080	4868080	Wait, wait.
4868080	4870080	Are you in an emotional mood right now?
4870080	4871080	Yeah.
4871080	4873080	Well, I already did the rap, and I almost died of a heart attack.
4873080	4874080	All right.
4874080	4875080	I just want to…
4875080	4876080	I'm still trying to…
4876080	4877080	I don't know if you…
4877080	4878080	I'm pouring sweat.
4878080	4880080	I'm like, like, like Louis Armstrong up here.
4880080	4881080	Yeah.
4881080	4882080	Yeah.
4882080	4883080	Yeah.
4883080	4884080	Yeah.
4884080	4885080	Yeah.
4885080	4886080	Yeah.
4886080	4887080	Yeah.
4887080	4888080	Brisbane.
4888080	4889080	Yeah.
4889080	4891080	Oh, boy.
4891080	4893080	Oh, Brisbane.
4893080	4898080	I'm going to fuck you all night long.
4898080	4900080	To the bill of bone.
4900080	4901080	To the knick-knock note.
4901080	4903080	To the break of dawn.
4903080	4906080	Oh, Brisbane.
4906080	4909080	B-R-I-S-B-A-N-E.
4909080	4911080	I assume.
4911080	4914080	I assume that's how you spell it.
4914080	4916080	Oh, I like your hotels.
4916080	4919080	They have new carpeting.
4920080	4922080	And the shower.
4922080	4927080	The water pressure could be better, but it was still nice.
4927080	4933080	A little tiny bar of soap and a disposable toothbrush from the airline.
4933080	4936080	That's probably not to your credit.
4936080	4940080	But I used it here and had a good time.
4940080	4942080	To the break of dawn.
4942080	4945080	B-R-I-S-B-A-N-E.
4945080	4948080	I like your hat, mate.
4949080	4950080	Yo.
4950080	4953080	Two times I told your mama this.
4953080	4956080	I need my piss guards to take a piss.
4956080	4957080	I put them on.
4957080	4959080	Took her to the room.
4959080	4962080	And I climbed inside her womb.
4962080	4965080	I became a baby that day.
4965080	4967080	And got born in a whole new way.
4967080	4969080	I'm an Australian now.
4969080	4971080	I see the world clearer.
4971080	4974080	I fucked your mama like a kangaroo that came nearer.
4974080	4977080	Then I wanted to when it sees reflections.
4977080	4981080	I fucked your mama so hard with my Australian erection.
4981080	4984080	A Tasmanian day.
4984080	4986080	In a true blue way.
4986080	4987080	Truth.
4987080	4988080	I fucked your mama.
4988080	4989080	True blue.
4989080	4990080	Fair dinkum.
4990080	4992080	I fucked your mama.
4992080	4993080	All right.
4993080	4995080	When did this become a rap?
4995080	4996080	You said you were feeling emotional.
4996080	4997080	Yeah, yeah.
4997080	4998080	I'm sorry.
4998080	5000080	Yo.
5000080	5004080	Everywhere I go I see the ocean.
5004080	5008080	Because Australia's a big giant island.
5008080	5011080	If you walk very far in any direction.
5011080	5014080	You'll see a bunch of water.
5014080	5017080	That's all I know about Australia.
5017080	5023080	I imagine surfing is very popular here.
5023080	5026080	I think I've seen that in movies.
5026080	5027080	They like to surf.
5027080	5030080	But here's the thing.
5035080	5038080	The track ran out.
5038080	5039080	All right.
5039080	5045080	Well, I was about to get to the 9-11 part.
5045080	5046080	All right.
5046080	5051080	So let's bring it down a notch.
5051080	5052080	From a dead stop?
5052080	5055080	We've had some fun.
5055080	5059080	I want to know who in the audience has had a real difficult time.
5059080	5061080	We want to help somebody.
5061080	5068080	Well, if it's everyone, who's had the worst time ever?
5068080	5070080	I don't mean want your money back.
5070080	5075080	We'll talk to you after the show if that's the case.
5075080	5078080	Well, you've been a good sport.
5078080	5084080	I see that you are using a chair instead of a regular chair.
5084080	5087080	Is that part of your difficult time?
5087080	5089080	But you're about to get out of it.
5089080	5091080	So already there's a triumph here.
5091080	5093080	You look like you're, okay.
5093080	5095080	Well, miracles.
5095080	5096080	Okay.
5096080	5098080	Do you need help coming up here?
5098080	5099080	We do have stairs.
5099080	5101080	Because God knows I did.
5101080	5102080	What's your name?
5102080	5103080	What's your name?
5103080	5104080	Louise.
5104080	5105080	Louise.
5105080	5107080	Welcome Louise to the stage, everybody.
5107080	5108080	A hand for Louise.
5108080	5118080	I don't think I've ever seen that kind of, it's a chair with wheels.
5118080	5121080	But it's not a classic wheelchair.
5121080	5125080	It's kind of a casual wheelchair.
5125080	5136080	All right, Louise.
5136080	5140080	Do you need help?
5140080	5143080	The closer you go.
5143080	5145080	It's a great song.
5145080	5146080	It's so good.
5146080	5148080	I'm really sweaty.
5148080	5149080	Do you mind?
5149080	5150080	No, she loves it.
5150080	5152080	You're a very sweaty man.
5152080	5154080	Is that him in there in the front?
5154080	5155080	He is, yes.
5155080	5157080	The cane handler?
5157080	5158080	Yes.
5158080	5159080	Do you love him?
5159080	5161080	How long have you guys been married?
5161080	5163080	We've been together 16 years.
5163080	5168080	And we've been married for eight years.
5168080	5169080	16?
5169080	5170080	16 years, yeah.
5170080	5172080	Man, I haven't done anything for 16 years.
5172080	5174080	I can't sit down on a regular chair.
5175080	5177080	It'll be all right for a bit.
5177080	5178080	You can stand.
5178080	5179080	Good.
5179080	5182080	I'm going to sit if that's okay.
5182080	5184080	I'm tired.
5184080	5185080	It's all right.
5185080	5190080	Can I ask, you're sitting in a chair that has wheels on it.
5190080	5193080	It's a wheelie walker.
5193080	5196080	A wheelchair and a walker at the same time.
5196080	5199080	You can get up out of it and use it as a walker.
5199080	5200080	Yes.
5200080	5202080	Why do you need it if I can ask?
5202080	5205080	I actually have what you have except much, much worse.
5205080	5206080	Alcoholism?
5206080	5207080	Alcoholism?
5207080	5208080	No.
5208080	5211080	That's the one thing.
5211080	5213080	Body odor?
5213080	5219080	It's like an advanced form of back pain.
5219080	5222080	How do you know about my back pain?
5222080	5225080	I'm a huge fucking fan.
5225080	5228080	I'm like a sanctioned stalker.
5228080	5230080	I'm a sanctioned stalker.
5231080	5234080	Is it like a degenerative spinal thing?
5234080	5235080	Yes.
5235080	5238080	I had a bicycle accident when I was six.
5238080	5241080	I smashed my two front teeth.
5241080	5244080	It impacted my spine, but they didn't know.
5244080	5248080	I'm three months older than you, Dan, believe it or not.
5248080	5251080	It's a while ago.
5251080	5253080	True blue.
5253080	5256080	Did you know they invented weird reactions here, Jeff?
5256080	5258080	That was weird.
5259080	5260080	Can I hit pause?
5260080	5261080	What was that one just about?
5261080	5262080	I don't know.
5262080	5264080	You said you were three months older and things got weird.
5264080	5266080	I don't know what that was about either, actually.
5266080	5268080	What was that one about?
5270080	5271080	A stocky vibe?
5271080	5272080	Oh, how dare you.
5272080	5273080	Oh, yeah.
5273080	5274080	Self-confessed stalker.
5274080	5280080	I've been a shut-in for about 18 months,
5280080	5285080	and so Harmontown's been a big part of keeping me sane, so yeah.
5285080	5291080	Permission to stock, granted.
5291080	5293080	You've been sanctioned.
5293080	5295080	Yes, thank you.
5295080	5297080	So yeah, I had this accident when I was a kid,
5297080	5300080	and then I didn't realize that I was having problems for a long time,
5300080	5305080	and then I got a series of kind of cluster fucks over a period,
5305080	5310080	and then I had a really bad, stressful time at a job that I can't talk about
5310080	5313080	for legal purposes, got really depressed.
5313080	5316080	Do you work for the starfish fucking robot?
5316080	5317080	For ISIS, yeah.
5317080	5318080	She works for ISIS.
5318080	5321080	For legal reasons, I can't tell you if I worked for starfish fuckers.
5321080	5324080	Yeah, so yeah.
5324080	5326080	But that was my friend.
5326080	5331080	So yeah, I went, things kind of spiraled downhill,
5331080	5334080	and then more stuff happened, and then I went overseas,
5334080	5337080	and four days into my trip away by myself,
5337080	5340080	I bent over and my back kind of went,
5340080	5344080	and then I've had, so then I came home,
5344080	5349080	Brad had to fly over to meet me, to take me home,
5349080	5354080	and I was trapped, so I've had periods of time where I've had like episodes,
5354080	5357080	so I've trapped in a bed for like three weeks at a time
5357080	5359080	where I can't even get up to go to the toilet,
5359080	5362080	Brad's had to do everything for me.
5362080	5365080	Yeah, so like I'd make up stupid songs,
5365080	5368080	like when I was able to get on the walker again,
5368080	5371080	and I'd sing, like to get through the pain,
5371080	5374080	I'd sing songs like, it's great not to poop in a tray,
5374080	5377080	hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray.
5377080	5380080	So that's kind of where, that's where I've been at.
5380080	5381080	So you've been having a hard time,
5381080	5383080	I've been, it's like your back's all fucked up,
5383080	5386080	and you've been having a real, real bad like battle of it, like lately.
5386080	5389080	Well, I'm officially disabled now, I just got the disability.
5389080	5390080	Is it permanent?
5390080	5391080	Yes.
5391080	5392080	Now it's permanent.
5392080	5393080	Yeah.
5393080	5395080	Well, let's let the pause for the, okay, go ahead.
5395080	5397080	You wanted to get, it's just officially disabled now.
5397080	5399080	It's fucking hard to get the pension.
5399080	5402080	I can't get a read on this audience at all.
5402080	5405080	I think they're, I think they're, I think they're a,
5405080	5407080	I was reading in the accent guide,
5407080	5409080	it's like something to do with like,
5409080	5412080	there's a silly, you have to be silly and playful in tone.
5412080	5414080	There's silly playful people.
5414080	5416080	They're not rowdy, they're not going to kill us or anything.
5416080	5417080	They're just very.
5417080	5418080	You keep believing that Dan.
5418080	5420080	I am here to kill you Dan.
5420080	5422080	I was up in the balcony man.
5422080	5424080	They inject starfish with poison here,
5424080	5426080	with a big giant yellow dick.
5426080	5427080	Robo dick.
5427080	5430080	They seem like, they seem like good people at heart.
5432080	5434080	Everyone's, everyone's good at heart.
5434080	5436080	Do you at least, so now you get,
5436080	5438080	you get whip ass parking now, right?
5438080	5440080	At least, is that a thing in Australia?
5440080	5442080	It's only literally been two days since I,
5442080	5445080	like after 18 months of battling with the government,
5445080	5447080	that we finally got the pension.
5447080	5450080	But it's like, I just don't leave the house basically.
5450080	5452080	This is like a huge fucking deal for me to come out.
5452080	5455080	I haven't come out in, and I'm actually going to Sydney.
5455080	5457080	I already bought my tickets for Sydney.
5457080	5458080	You're going to be at Sydney too?
5458080	5459080	Alright.
5459080	5462080	And then, and then my friends were over the other night.
5462080	5464080	They were like, do you realise they're playing in Brisbane?
5464080	5466080	I'm like, what the fuck?
5466080	5468080	So yeah, I bought tickets to come tonight.
5468080	5471080	So I'm going to be, yeah.
5471080	5473080	I was like, yeah, so hardcore.
5473080	5474080	I was like, oh, I'm missing out on Melbourne.
5474080	5475080	But that's just great.
5475080	5476080	It's like, it's amazing.
5476080	5478080	The Melbourne show's going to suck.
5478080	5479080	No, it's going to be the best.
5479080	5480080	The Melbourne show.
5480080	5481080	First of all, I don't even know.
5481080	5482080	I'm always torn.
5482080	5484080	Sorry guys, but the Melbourne show will be your best.
5485080	5488080	Alright, now I'm officially in love with Brisbane.
5488080	5493080	I mean, it's so funny because it sounds like a fight's about to break out,
5493080	5498080	but everyone's just having like a good fucking, a good laugh at everybody else's expense.
5498080	5499080	That's right.
5499080	5500080	It's kind of like...
5500080	5501080	Fuck you too, honey.
5505080	5506080	Is that what it is?
5506080	5511080	No one really takes anything that seriously here, so it's fucking...
5512080	5515080	I think it's kind of like if James Franco was a city.
5516080	5518080	That's how I've been feeling about it.
5518080	5519080	It's so weird though.
5519080	5521080	It's like walking down the street, like for the last two days, walking down the street,
5521080	5523080	it's eerily quiet.
5523080	5524080	It's very peaceful.
5524080	5527080	There's not loud Americans except for us.
5527080	5531080	We were in bars and restaurants and clearly we're the loud people there.
5531080	5534080	But it's just very placid and nice and people having a good time.
5534080	5536080	But in here, it's just fucking madness.
5536080	5537080	It's great.
5537080	5542080	Well, let's give Louise a wish aside from coming to this amazing show.
5542080	5545080	And seeing my friend Kate kick ass on stage.
5545080	5547080	That was so fucking cool.
5547080	5549080	Oh yeah, fucking Kate on sound effects.
5549080	5550080	Holy shit.
5550080	5551080	That will not soon be forgotten.
5551080	5553080	But also, is it Brad?
5553080	5554080	Brad?
5554080	5555080	Yeah, Brad.
5555080	5558080	I think MVP Award goes to Brad for cleaning up your poop forever.
5558080	5560080	Yeah, yeah.
5563080	5565080	He is a god.
5565080	5566080	He is a god.
5566080	5567080	I worship him.
5567080	5569080	He is a king amongst nerds.
5569080	5570080	I'm moving to Brisbane.
5570080	5571080	I fucking love it here.
5571080	5574080	He's also like a total renaissance nerd.
5574080	5577080	He's been creating independent comics for like 20 years.
5577080	5578080	Nice.
5578080	5579080	Oh, nice.
5579080	5580080	He's kind of awesome.
5580080	5581080	What is that?
5581080	5583080	So yeah, well, what does that do to a relationship?
5583080	5588080	Because I live in terror of that, like becoming infirm and like how I'll become like an asshole
5588080	5589080	because I'm a baby.
5589080	5591080	Oh, you will be a fucking asshole.
5591080	5593080	I was a complete cunt.
5593080	5595080	I was not gracious at all.
5595080	5599080	I was saying like, why don't you leave me?
5599080	5604080	And take me out and shoot me like a fucking dog.
5604080	5607080	Because I was just in so much pain.
5607080	5611080	So what gets you across the threshold other than maybe painkillers?
5611080	5616080	Is there an epiphany you had that you could impart to me for when I get a foot ache and
5616080	5618080	don't destroy my life?
5618080	5619080	Herbal medicine.
5619080	5622080	Like rather than don't go down the traditional route like I did.
5622080	5624080	I had surgery and stuff.
5624080	5625080	I don't know.
5625080	5626080	What traditional medicine?
5626080	5627080	Herbal medicine.
5627080	5628080	Like Chinese herbal medicine.
5628080	5629080	Wait, which ones though?
5629080	5632080	Well, I could, you could hit me up.
5632080	5633080	Okay.
5633080	5635080	They're now, they're now booing Chinese medicine.
5635080	5636080	A lot of people.
5636080	5641080	This stuff like, you know, things like turmeric has been well researched for its anti-inflammatory
5641080	5642080	properties.
5642080	5644080	So I definitely recommend you take turmeric.
5644080	5647080	That's not even, that's not even Eastern medicine.
5647080	5648080	That's just nutrition science.
5648080	5649080	You guys are.
5649080	5650080	Yeah.
5650080	5651080	That's just normal science.
5651080	5654080	But are you saying, you're saying that's the, you said, don't go down the path.
5654080	5655080	I went down.
5655080	5656080	I'm actually confused.
5656080	5661080	So I have, if I wasn't wearing a onesie, I'd show you my trampstand scar from the surgery
5661080	5662080	I had.
5662080	5664080	And, um, um,
5664080	5665080	Do you want to see it?
5665080	5667080	Would you wish me to see my, uh, me undies?
5667080	5669080	Yeah, sure.
5669080	5672080	Oh, shit.
5672080	5675080	Very nice.
5675080	5680080	They're little, they're little donuts and there's a hole right in the asshole.
5681080	5684080	Dan, this is like a dream come true.
5684080	5685080	Thank you.
5685080	5686080	That's what I was hoping.
5686080	5687080	I didn't want it to seem forced.
5687080	5691080	I can see a little pee pee poking out of your thing.
5691080	5692080	What do you mean?
5692080	5693080	What?
5693080	5694080	Shut up.
5694080	5695080	Your dick was coming out of the house.
5695080	5696080	Shut up.
5696080	5697080	Not really.
5697080	5698080	I think that was a donut.
5698080	5699080	My dick was out?
5699080	5700080	No, probably so.
5700080	5703080	There would be like, there would be like police, like, like, like.
5703080	5705080	But yeah, you can get, um.
5705080	5708080	The fucking, all laws are off in this building right now.
5709080	5713080	Given the impression that the pain, that pain is one directional, that you have a, like,
5713080	5716080	a spot that causes the pain and sends the message to your brain.
5716080	5722080	But pain is more like, you know, um, an ant colony coming to your house when a storm comes
5722080	5724080	and they just all flood in.
5724080	5726080	Is that how ants work?
5726080	5729080	Yeah, they come in the rain.
5729080	5731080	I was trying to think of metaphors to explain it.
5731080	5735080	You almost need like a mini medical degree to understand my condition.
5735080	5737080	It's a central nervous system.
5737080	5738080	Pain condition.
5738080	5741080	It can be triggered by, anyway.
5741080	5744080	I don't understand what their stance is or what they're...
5744080	5745080	Yeah, I'm not really sure.
5745080	5748080	I don't know if they want you to be in more pain or less pain.
5748080	5756080	I feel like this is the scene in Mutiny in the Bounty when they try to kill Captain Blood.
5756080	5760080	I think what happens, I think what I've realized has happened in my sort of shut-in days is
5760080	5766080	that people have become really, like, associate herbal medicine or anything kind of, like, outside of the,
5766080	5771080	you know, like, mainstream medicine sphere as being, like, you're either like a flat earth or an anti-vaxxer.
5771080	5772080	Right, right.
5772080	5779080	So I think that their reaction might be is that they're encoding what I'm saying as somebody who has a...
5779080	5780080	Yeah, that's it.
5780080	5781080	Yeah.
5781080	5782080	Oh, it's probably...
5782080	5783080	Yeah, I just...
5783080	5785080	She's made out of turmeric.
5785080	5786080	What can I say?
5786080	5789080	I love, um, I love racist rangas.
5789080	5791080	That's why I like Donald Trump so much.
5791080	5794080	Yeah, I don't think she's one of the bad guys regardless of how she's treating her pain.
5794080	5798080	If you really are that concerned with her and want to give her painkillers after the show, I'm sure she'll take them.
5798080	5800080	Well, I'm actually, I'm actually lucky.
5800080	5805080	I said to my GP that I'm lucky that I'm a constipated pothead because otherwise I'd probably be dead.
5805080	5806080	Oh.
5806080	5810080	Yeah, because I was able to access that instead of the opioids, which probably would have killed me.
5810080	5812080	I think we have the name of our episode.
5812080	5813080	Yeah, constipated pothead.
5813080	5814080	Constipated pothead.
5814080	5821080	I couldn't, I couldn't take the opioid medication because it'd make me sit down for too long on the toilet, which then could cause me more pain.
5821080	5822080	Right.
5822080	5823080	Let's hear it for Louise, everybody.
5823080	5824080	Jesus Christ.
5824080	5825080	Well, wait a minute.
5825080	5826080	Well, okay.
5826080	5827080	Yeah.
5827080	5828080	Let's...
5828080	5830080	Louise, uh, uh, uh, uh, is there...
5830080	5832080	I mean, we started talking about pooping and I had to...
5832080	5833080	Sorry, yeah.
5833080	5835080	I had to pull the trigger on that one.
5835080	5843080	As a fan of the show, yeah, we'll send her out of the way, but as a fan of the show, is there anything that, uh, that you think that we would be able to grant you as a wish,
5843080	5845080	like something you'd like to see or hear?
5845080	5846080	You showed her your underwear.
5846080	5847080	Uh...
5847080	5848080	That was good.
5848080	5849080	No, no, no.
5849080	5850080	That was my wish.
5850080	5851080	It's a joke.
5851080	5852080	It's a joke.
5852080	5853080	Continue.
5853080	5854080	Um, do you mean generally or tonight?
5854080	5855080	Yeah, it just made a request or something.
5855080	5856080	I think, I think, um...
5856080	5858080	I'm out of show as of like 20 minutes ago.
5858080	5859080	Yeah.
5859080	5860080	For an hour and a half.
5860080	5866080	I would really, I would also like you to take care of yourself because I, I think that you're, uh, like, yeah.
5866080	5868080	I, I'd really, I'd really like to see you.
5868080	5871080	And if you want any advice, you could hit me up.
5872080	5881080	Um, but yeah, I, I would really, I'd really love to see you take more self care because I think you have a beautiful mind and I would like to see that in the world for as long as possible.
5882080	5883080	Alright.
5886080	5887080	Thank you, Louise.
5887080	5889080	And poop. More poop.
5889080	5890080	More poop.
5890080	5894080	Not gonna happen.
5894080	5896080	Not gonna happen.
5896080	5900080	That ship has sailed.
5900080	5901080	Thank you, Louise.
5901080	5906080	I really thought she'd say like, you know, could you do a reggae song or something?
5907080	5911080	And then she hit me with the old, take care of yourself.
5911080	5914080	My therapist keeps saying that, self-care, self-care.
5914080	5916080	Well, what? Like, should I drink less?
5916080	5918080	Like...
5919080	5921080	Yeah, see, I don't know who to listen to.
5921080	5925080	Well, you can't ask this audience, I guess, or no question.
5926080	5927080	I'll say, yeah.
5927080	5928080	It's, it's really...
5928080	5931080	I mean, I really, I don't drink that. It's only when I'm with you guys that I'm drinking.
5931080	5934080	Dan only drinks when he's alone or with people.
5936080	5942080	I do, I do feel like I'm kind of getting kind of shatner-y when I look in the mirror, like I'm starting to pickle and bloat, you know.
5942080	5947080	You're looking like a little bit of a, like a heavy set George Carlin right now with the hair slicked back.
5949080	5950080	Yeah.
5950080	5951080	Steeper one.
5951080	5952080	Steeper one.
5952080	5954080	Yeah, a stingray someone to come up and stab you.
5956080	5957080	Oh, fuck off.
5959080	5961080	That's, that's your threshold.
5962080	5963080	Steve Irwin.
5964080	5965080	He's a national hero.
5965080	5968080	I know, but I didn't bring it up. This fucking guy did.
5970080	5973080	He got, he used to hang out with crocodiles.
5973080	5974080	They got killed by a fish.
5974080	5977080	Also, you don't, you don't really look like Steve Irwin.
5977080	5979080	I don't even get that.
5979080	5980080	Well, they just like saying stuff.
5980080	5982080	Yeah, no, I can tell. I can tell.
5982080	5984080	They're, they're, they're, they're excited.
5984080	5985080	They're, they're, they're...
5985080	5986080	I can tell.
5986080	5988080	They're a jocular people.
5988080	5989080	It's true.
5989080	5990080	The Brisbaneites.
5990080	5991080	Uh.
5991080	5992080	Brisbaneians.
5992080	5993080	I, I, uh, yeah.
5993080	5996080	What's that? Ficus? You're just yelling out plants?
5997080	5999080	Where's, where's Vegas?
5999080	6000080	He said Briz-Bagus.
6000080	6002080	Oh, Briz, Briz-Bagus.
6002080	6004080	Like a portmanteau.
6005080	6006080	Oh, Brisbane.
6008080	6010080	Yeah, the city that sleeps.
6011080	6015080	At least until 10 a.m. when the bars start serving.
6015080	6017080	Brisbane on a Thursday night.
6017080	6019080	Shit is on the hook.
6025080	6030080	The thing is, there's only 300 people here, but this, because we're the only game in town right now.
6030080	6033080	This is like, it's not like Springsteen's rolling through here later on.
6033080	6037080	What should we do, Jeff? I'm like, we got like 15 left, I think, Max.
6037080	6042080	I, I think we, uh, we fuck gently off into the night and take them all out to karaoke with us.
6045080	6050080	I know, I'm afraid to, I mean, we're not gonna get one answer, but where should we go after the show?
6050080	6051080	Where should we?
6051080	6053080	I used to say, throw it out of the crowd.
6055080	6056080	Home. Someone said home.
6056080	6058080	We should go home.
6058080	6062080	Alright, we're all going to L.A. We're all going to the drawing room to do karaoke.
6064080	6066080	We'll find a place and you'll, uh...
6067080	6069080	Sunny's House of Blues is thrown out there?
6069080	6071080	Oh, that's the place with the karaoke, right?
6071080	6072080	Yeah.
6075080	6077080	That's what we're figuring out.
6077080	6079080	I say, when the show's over, we all split up.
6080080	6082080	We'll cover more ground that way.
6086080	6088080	I love you guys so much.
6088080	6092080	I, I only resent that I'm not out there drinking with you currently. I'm up here on stage.
6092080	6093080	Alright.
6094080	6096080	Okay, shut up.
6098080	6102080	What do we do? More, more, uh, more musical interludes?
6104080	6108080	Pringles Dick? Why don't we all do a rousing version of Pringles Dick together?
6109080	6112080	Who, by applause, knows the words to Pringles Dick?
6113080	6117080	Alright, for those of you who are not applauding, I'm sorry for what's about to happen.
6117080	6121080	This is a song I improvised on a tour bus in one go.
6121080	6127080	I was holding a Pringles Dick, uh, a Pringles can up to my crotch like it was my dick.
6128080	6130080	Yeah. And it goes like this.
6130080	6136080	Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out why.
6136080	6142080	I don't really have a Pringles Dick, I just keep my dick inside.
6142080	6148080	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
6148080	6152080	Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out.
6152080	6154080	No, I never found out.
6154080	6157080	I never really found out why.
6166080	6169080	Now we're gonna do a Land Down Under by fucking minute work.
6172080	6174080	Let's do, let's do Pauline Henson, the musical.
6174080	6180080	Let's try to, let's try to make her a sympathetic character.
6180080	6181080	Okay.
6181080	6183080	Tell people the untold story.
6191080	6194080	Fade in on an apocalyptic wasteland.
6195080	6199080	Pan over to a cave of jagged stalagmites.
6200080	6202080	Pushing in.
6202080	6207080	We hear the roars of a, of a, of a, of a bear giving birth.
6211080	6214080	A single slick Pauline Henson.
6216080	6218080	Plops from a bear's vagina.
6219080	6221080	A ledge vag.
6224080	6226080	But her sign all the same.
6227080	6238080	As Pauline spreads her gremlin ears from across her face and extends her claw-like hands in song.
6238080	6239080	Whoo!
6252080	6258080	I'm Pauline Henson.
6259080	6266080	I'm going to do some things and then some.
6266080	6270080	I'm a demon lady from a bear's vagina.
6270080	6279080	I'm going to South Carolina after I destroy Australia.
6280080	6283080	Dissolve to college.
6287080	6288080	Brrrrring!
6288080	6292080	Oh my God, that politics class was so amazing.
6293080	6299080	I know, I can't believe we're Australians from the valley.
6300080	6304080	Pauline, like, who are you taking to prom?
6304080	6314080	I don't know because I like that hat might, but I don't want a Huntsman on my tank.
6315080	6316080	Pauline, you're so silly.
6316080	6321080	You can have any guy you want, but I wonder what kind of guy you like.
6323080	6329080	I want a man who makes cabbage soup.
6333080	6335080	Oh my God, what an amazing song.
6336080	6339080	Uh oh, here comes the professor.
6340080	6342080	What's all this, then?
6342080	6346080	Pauline, what are you singing about, boys, in the hallway for?
6346080	6348080	Oh, professor, I'm just trying to...
6348080	6351080	Oh, you're just trying to get expelled.
6351080	6354080	You can't have any pudding if you don't eat your meat.
6355080	6358080	No, I'm expelled.
6358080	6362080	Three years later, in medical school.
6364080	6366080	Suture.
6366080	6368080	You know what, forget these sutures.
6368080	6371080	Let's just pour nutrition on this wound.
6375080	6377080	Chinese needles.
6378080	6380080	Witch hazel.
6381080	6383080	Eye of Newt.
6384080	6387080	Now it's time to become president of Australia.
6389080	6393080	I want to rule Down Under.
6396080	6400080	Bring the brimstone fire, lightning and thunder.
6400080	6402080	It's the only thing that rhymes with Down Under.
6403080	6406080	I'm Pauline Henson and I'm here to say
6406080	6410080	I like to do rhymes in the laziest way.
6411080	6415080	I am Pauline Henson.
6422080	6425080	A landslide election has occurred.
6426080	6429080	The Australian Electoral College has decided...
6430080	6434080	that Pauline Henson is the president even though she only got six votes.
6434080	6440080	The Queensland represents 17,000 electoral votes
6440080	6443080	and so now she's president.
6444080	6449080	I swear to take the duties of Christ and my eternal soul
6449080	6454080	to rule all of Australia with ease and grace.
6455080	6458080	Now to go to the Australian White House.
6459080	6468080	I love, I love, okay, it's not a song, it's just a transition.
6468080	6471080	Ah, pencils, drawers.
6471080	6473080	Ah, beer!
6473080	6477080	A giant beer claw shoots out of Pauline's top drawer
6477080	6483080	grabbing her face and pulling her into a cosmic world of introspection.
6490080	6496080	What have I done with my life?
6497080	6502080	Yeah, a bear comes out and is kind of ethnic.
6504080	6507080	Well, what do you, I mean, what do you want from me?
6508080	6514080	Yeah, Pauline, you need to atone for your sins.
6515080	6517080	No!
6517080	6520080	No, no, no, no!
6520080	6522080	No!
6522080	6524080	Yeah, no!
6525080	6527080	All right.
6532080	6536080	The bear reaches out and puts a single sigil into her forehead.
6536080	6541080	It's a Tasmanian ancient outback sigil.
6542080	6550080	It represents the four elements, fire, water, poison spiders, and flip-flops.
6554080	6557080	You don't correct a person's improv.
6558080	6562080	That's the first, you know what, that's the first thing you've done tonight that upset me.
6563080	6566080	I was so, we were working so well together.
6566080	6569080	All right, fine, bonk, bonk, whatever you said.
6570080	6571080	Thongs.
6571080	6572080	I've had it with you.
6572080	6573080	Dick talks.
6574080	6578080	I'm not going near those things, I'm fucking filled with huntsmen.
6579080	6583080	Pauline's head falls off and Australia enters a bright new world
6583080	6591080	filled with olives and fairies and angels and Gaelic chants.
6591080	6599080	Oh, alight ye tie to tie, tie to tie tie, Australia's been saved.
6599080	6601080	These songs are short.
6604080	6606080	You didn't think it was a good idea to do this musical.
6606080	6607080	No, no, I'm helping.
6607080	6609080	You're just speeding it along.
6609080	6611080	You know that my songs are not the strong part.
6611080	6613080	This second act is dragon.
6613080	6615080	It's my, okay.
6615080	6616080	A dragon!
6616080	6618080	Oh shit, a dragon.
6621080	6623080	I'm a dragon.
6623080	6624080	Okay.
6626080	6629080	Pauline Henson's body turns to ash.
6629080	6634080	The ashes sprinkle across the northern coast of Australia
6634080	6641080	where the national bird, which is the Tuscany,
6641080	6646080	they eat the ash laden water and they turn into angelic figures
6646080	6649080	and the entire continent is lifted high above
6649080	6652080	and revealed that Atlantis was underneath Australia the whole time.
6652080	6656080	Crown of Thorns starfish rise up and form into one giant
6656080	6658080	crown of thorns Godzilla starfish.
6658080	6662080	A robot comes out and a huge dick goes into the crown of thorns starfish mouth,
6662080	6665080	pumps it full of milk and air and poison
6665080	6670080	and the crown of thorns starfish explodes into a million pieces of starfish
6670080	6672080	which as you know regenerate.
6673080	6679080	A lone starfish rises and sings its sad song.
6679080	6685080	I am a starfish and I want to be loved as well as you.
6687080	6692080	I have five fingers instead of hands.
6695080	6700080	I have no head, I just have five fingers, no hands.
6703080	6706080	I cartwheel instead of walking.
6707080	6710080	I suck onto the sides of everything.
6711080	6716080	My life is doomed to be the villain of the ecosystem
6716080	6720080	until I get fucked by robot dicks.
6721080	6726080	Why couldn't I have six fingers?
6727080	6730080	The credits roll.
6734080	6737080	There wasn't enough show.
6737080	6739080	I had to fill in some at the end there.
6739080	6741080	That was fantastic.
6741080	6743080	Let's give it up for all of our volunteers.
6743080	6748080	First of all, Rio and Jeff doing sound and light here at this awesome theater.
6748080	6751080	The Trip It is one of the coolest venues of all time.
6751080	6754080	Here we have an echo.
6754080	6757080	Josh, Darcy, Kate, Louise, Brad.
6757080	6762080	Let's give it up for Pauline Hansen, shall we everybody? Pauline Hansen.
6763080	6766080	Louise's husband for carrying for the oops.
6766080	6767080	I said Brad.
6767080	6769080	Oh I didn't know, I didn't know it was Brad.
6769080	6772080	Spencer Crittenden everybody.
6773080	6777080	I'm Jeff Davison, your mayor Dan Harmon everybody.
6778080	6780080	Thank you Brisbane, God bless you.
6781080	6783080	Follow us to Melbourne.
6784080	6789080	Or at least let's all meet outside and find a karaoke place where we can all invade.
6790080	6793080	Try fast on the wrong side of the road and take chances everybody.
6793080	6794080	Thank you so much.
6795080	6797080	Try to get those Doritos figured out.
6812080	6814080	Did you get any of that?
6815080	6817080	It's a good show.
