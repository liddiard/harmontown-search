0	7520	Ladies and gentlemen, put your digital hands together.
7520	8520	So awful.
8520	12120	Ladies and gentlemen, the Humid Town is now in session.
12120	14880	Please welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.
14880	17600	Oh, you can make more noise than that.
17600	18600	Yeah.
18600	19600	Thank you so much.
19600	21680	He's worked so hard for you.
21680	22680	How are you, man?
22680	23680	Welcome back.
23680	24680	Good to see you always.
24680	25680	Always good, comfortable to see.
25880	29080	Always good, comfortable to see.
29080	31640	Puts me at ease, we're ready to have a good show.
31640	33600	I know, full show, good show tonight.
33600	37280	With Jeff, it's like, what is he about to pull, you know?
37280	38680	I'm too dumb to be evil.
38680	43040	No, no, you just are, you're on the side of good.
43040	45800	I'm coming out as saying Jeff is not.
45800	48400	It's about time somebody really fucking pulled Jeff's strings.
48400	48900	Yeah.
48900	50920	Because not a good dude.
50920	53000	I do know a really good dude, though.
53000	56640	And he is the mayor of Harmon Town.
56640	59160	Put your hands together, make some noise, slap your dog.
59160	61040	Ladies and gentlemen, Dan Harmon.
61040	63680	Don't slap your dog.
63680	71040	Yo, yo, yo, me, rap, beat, rap, rapping, rap to the beat.
71040	73080	My name is MC Rap Beat.
73080	75560	I like to rap to the beat when I rap in the street.
75560	78040	I like to rap with my hands and also my feet.
78040	81280	I like to rap with a Tweety Bird, tweet, tweet, tweet.
81360	83760	I like the snow and the sleet.
83760	87080	Don't let it stop me, because I'm mailing this sheet to you.
87080	90760	Through a rap shoe that I put on my foot when I bring it to you.
90760	93400	I'm a Mr. MC rapping a lot.
93400	94800	I changed my name.
94800	96160	My name's MC Snot.
96160	99000	My name's MC Glaps a lot.
99000	101000	My name is Polka Dot.
101000	103640	I'm a rapping, rapping, rapping, roo.
103640	106600	I'm getting my energy up before the shoe starts.
106600	107440	OK, all right, good.
107440	107940	Here we go.
107940	109640	Yeah.
109640	112320	Oh, boy.
112320	114760	It's important to have me off guard, flat footed.
114760	116040	Yeah.
116040	116560	Hi, Brandon.
116560	118440	Thanks for guest-controlling, Brandon Johnson.
118440	119440	I'm so happy to be here.
119440	120960	I'm so sorry, Jeff Davis is gone.
120960	122240	Where is he?
122240	122840	I don't know.
122840	124680	He's going to India.
124680	125200	Never mind.
125200	126080	I don't know if he's there yet.
126080	127360	Yeah, I don't think he's there yet.
127360	127880	Too bowler.
127880	129560	Too bowler, man.
129560	130480	Here's the never mind.
130480	132160	He's flying Emirates.
132160	133320	Yeah, never mind.
133320	134720	That dude.
134720	138920	He said he has a petting zoo in his section of the plane.
138920	140480	But I bet it's like two turtles.
140480	142800	Yeah, his life is like what my life would be like
142800	143880	if my parents had loved me.
146520	148120	I don't know if that's how he got there.
150920	153280	Maybe like the indirect result of Drew Carey's parents
153280	156080	really not loving him a lot, and it trickled down.
156080	156600	Who knows?
156600	159560	We have no idea who to thank.
159560	163800	Let's just thank the god of privilege, privilege.
163800	164480	That's the name.
164480	165000	Yeah.
170000	171920	Whatever.
171920	173040	How have you been?
173040	174000	I never ask about you.
174000	174720	I've been good.
174720	175320	I've been good.
175320	176320	There's not much to tell.
176320	177720	You know, seven dry cleaners.
177720	179320	I keep everything legit.
179320	181760	You know, my maid won't seem to do her work.
181760	185040	But other than that, life is good.
185040	187200	If those are the only jigsaw pieces you have of Brandon's
187200	190120	life, you now, like, that could be anything.
190120	192480	Seven dry cleaners, a maid that won't.
192480	194720	We don't know if he's in a giant mansion
194720	198040	or a tiny, like, William Gibson techno coffin.
198040	200080	Pretty sure it's a deluxe apartment in the sky.
200080	201880	Yeah.
201880	202920	Moving on up.
202920	205440	What was the thing in the Jefferson's theme?
205440	208240	It was that beans don't burn in the kitchen.
208240	208840	That's right.
208840	211640	And what doesn't burn on a grill?
211640	214720	I think it's something else doesn't burn on a grill.
214720	216680	Something else doesn't burn on a grill.
216680	217560	I have to get the whole thing in my bag.
217560	218920	Are you offended that I'm coming to you
218920	220000	for the answer to this?
220000	221320	No, it's a mystery to all people.
221320	222120	Right.
223080	225960	I'm asking Brandon as a representative of the 70s,
225960	227640	not anything else.
227640	230040	This is going to be, I feel so bad because so many people
230040	233800	on Reddit are going to be like, oh, what's this?
233800	234880	I need that, though.
234880	236320	They need that more than we do.
236320	239120	I think they might be calming down now, though.
239120	239840	I don't know.
239840	241240	Nah.
241240	242960	It's funny how we have moods, and our moods
242960	244280	affect our perception of the world.
244280	246800	Like, right now, I feel like the world is more
246800	247840	comfortable with racism.
247840	249400	Where did I get that?
249400	250520	Why did I decide that?
250520	251240	What did I?
252200	254240	The answer is it's something I ate.
254240	255240	It's not something I saw.
255240	257040	I didn't see somebody come out with a report on Reddit
257040	258960	that said, we're going to be less sensitive now.
258960	260800	I think it was because of an epiphany I had.
260800	263680	I was eating breakfast with my girlfriend and her dad.
263680	267480	And I don't know what got my mind onto it,
267480	269520	but then I just started realizing this.
269520	272680	The thing about epiphanies about how you really,
272680	275280	I don't know, the good ones are just like, duh-duh-ys.
275280	275800	They're not.
275800	277720	When you explain them, they're like, yeah,
277720	280680	I had that epiphany when I was 13.
281120	283160	And I've had this one, I feel, several times.
283160	285880	But there's a difference between that and feeling it.
285880	288840	I really started to feel at breakfast,
288840	291360	because I pulled out my phone, and I wrote it down.
291360	294920	I was like, hashtag epiphany in my Bear Notes app.
294920	298920	I got to remember this epiphany, which was just that.
298920	301160	Wait, what's Bear Notes app?
301160	303440	It's my latest app I'm trying.
303440	304280	Sorry, continue.
304280	308240	Bear, if you look it up in the app store, it's based on tags.
308560	311400	Tag clouds instead of, it's weird.
311400	313520	It's weird at first, but if you get used to it,
313520	315080	it could be good, I don't know.
315080	316400	Why did I key on that?
316400	317240	I don't know.
318800	320040	Here's my epiphany.
320040	324920	So if you're a machine, or let's say an organism,
324920	325760	it really doesn't matter.
325760	327120	Organisms are machines.
330880	333760	You're a structure, you have internal mechanisms.
333760	337680	You are capable, you take things in, and you put things out.
338680	342680	And so flowers do that, whales do that, the Earth does that,
342680	344680	every system does that, every device does that.
344680	348480	So we're all just systems, each of us individually.
348480	352960	So we take in good shit, we take in bad shit.
352960	356680	And we're all different, so there's different shit
356680	358960	that's bad to every person.
358960	362920	If somebody says the N word on the freeway at me,
362920	365160	it makes me confused.
365160	367080	It means something different to you.
367400	369880	It's both bad things coming out of that person.
369880	374880	But I go, there's a lot of weird confusion
375640	377240	at the top of that, my process,
377240	379400	because I'm like, is there lighting weird in my car?
379400	382480	What's with this person, are they blind?
382480	386880	I don't know, are they on my side, and are they black?
386880	390640	And they're like high-fiving me for my awesome driving.
390640	395640	So the definition of what a bad thing is, is subjective.
399160	403440	It's not about like, oh, some people are in such a good mood
403440	405960	that like, I don't know, I listen to podcasts
405960	408120	where there's people that, they have problems
408120	410240	and there's people that wanna help them with their problems.
410240	413960	So for those people, you and I would consider toxic,
413960	417080	that person considers an episode of a podcast.
417080	419760	So not to get too derailed with that,
420080	423640	the larger point being, you have all this shit
423640	428200	that comes at you, and it's all good and bad mixed up shit.
428200	431200	And then we all have the ability as systems
431200	433920	to first of all, we're constantly growing
433920	437280	and reprogramming ourselves, restructuring ourselves,
437280	441120	just as cells and plants and factories and us.
441120	444520	And this stuff comes in.
444520	447160	So we first of all, the miracles that we do have
447200	451400	the ability to take in like diarrhea, like not literally,
451400	455680	but like verbal diarrhea, such as I'm spouting right now,
455680	458320	or really horrible toxic, like horrible shit,
458320	461560	like what you see on Facebook or Twitter or toxicity
461560	463360	or someone attacking you in a comment section
463360	468360	because you said something wrong or bad shit.
468600	473600	We have the ability to turn it into good shit.
473600	476600	The classic example being that if I have a terrible life,
476600	480600	if everybody picks on me, if I feel awful,
480600	483200	if I have feelings of anxiety and depression and things
483200	485240	because of the shit that's happening to me in my life,
485240	487000	but then I write a play about it,
487000	489040	and then everyone goes and sees the play
489040	491880	and walks out feeling really good,
491880	493640	not because it's a feel good play,
493640	495560	but because they saw a good play,
495560	498160	like there's catharsis, like you can see a depressing play
498160	500000	and be like, wow, he fucking nailed it.
500000	501440	He knows exactly how depressed I am.
502440	504240	And then some of your question comes up,
504240	506960	the bottom line being like, as we all know,
506960	509240	you can take in bad stuff and you can put out good stuff.
509240	512800	And in fact, that's kind of what we try to do all the time.
512800	517800	So like, now that times have gotten for most of us
518120	522080	very challenging, there's a lot of shit in the air.
522080	524120	There's a lot of bad stuff coming at us.
524120	526560	It's just sort of sitting at breakfast
526560	529080	and just thinking about all these podcasts
529080	530640	I've been listening to where people do,
531520	532960	I don't know, there's shit that rolls off their back
532960	534320	that I find amazing.
534320	535640	It's like, how come you don't just tell that person
535640	536640	to go fuck themselves?
537840	540480	Why are you trying to still understand this person
540480	543040	and help them with their in-laws for your little podcast?
543040	546080	It's not just greed, it's like you're Canadian or something.
546080	547640	I don't know what it is.
547640	550880	I guess I should promote the podcast I'm describing.
550880	555880	It's on the Gimlet network, it's called Heavyweight.
556920	559800	It's this guy, John, something.
559880	563520	And he just makes his friends and family's business
563520	565600	all his business and he's like a really friendly guy
565600	570600	and he tries to resolve long unresolved issues,
571280	572880	family members that aren't speaking to each other
572880	573920	for decades.
573920	575160	Are they on the show?
575160	577960	Yeah, the person, a friend or a relative
577960	580000	or someone that he knows will come to him
580000	582080	with something that's been weighing on them.
582080	583360	I think that's why it's called Heavyweight
583360	586040	and then he'll just get up all in their shit
586040	588520	and make phone calls and arrange meetings.
589320	591720	I was just kind of marveling at the guys.
591720	593840	Because there's people that attack him,
593840	595440	there's people that criticize him,
595440	598200	there's people that are engaged in
598200	601280	vampiric toxicity towards him or shit.
601280	603880	His famous episode is the one where a friend of his
603880	608880	who is a guy who gave Moby all of those black people LPs
611000	615680	that Moby used to launch us to become a billionaire.
615680	620080	Like, oh, I don't know, I got a fish bone on my plate.
620080	625080	And then Moby, the guy that gave that disc set to him
627480	631960	or whatever is also a musician, but he's not Moby
631960	633840	and he's not active.
633840	636040	So there's a whole episode about him wanting to
636040	640160	just basically talk to Moby again and kind of like,
640160	641840	it was weird and it was awkward and
642680	647680	like, this guy that gets involved in this shit,
648280	652960	he actively gallops into shit that I would be like,
652960	654800	no, fuck that, nope, nope, nope, yeah.
656560	658720	And so I was sitting at breakfast kind of digesting,
658720	660760	having binge listened to this guy's podcast
660760	662840	and I'm just like, I am a bad person,
662840	667640	like I should be after all I have gotten after all.
667640	670480	It's like, why am I so sensitive?
670480	672280	If this guy isn't.
672280	676240	And I was like, wait, well, sensitivity, he's sensitive too.
676240	679600	And I was like, ah, sensitivity is different
679600	682120	from fucking systemic shutdown.
682120	687120	Like, you can be sensitive to garbage.
687480	689800	Like, you can be like, that guy's lying,
689800	692080	that guy's racist, that guy's full of shit,
692080	693400	that guy's kind of full of shit,
693400	695600	but trying to convince himself he's not full of shit.
695600	699320	So like, you can have a really laser resolution
699320	700960	of bullshit detection,
700960	702920	and that person wants something from me,
702920	705600	that person's a drag, that person's an energy drain.
707200	708960	But you don't need to,
708960	711880	it's not a superior machine that recognizes that shit
711880	715240	and then in response to anything less than perfect goes,
715240	719520	pew, and that's kind of what we're doing
719520	722280	probably a little too much of is going like,
722280	727280	oh no, no, no, you just said that and nope, pew, pew,
728240	730760	that either like makes me blow a whistle
730760	734600	that like shrieks at the top, a thousand decibels.
734600	739600	Is that, if that's your function, that's good.
740160	742200	Like, you should stay that sensitive
742200	744400	and you should then be the alarm person.
744400	749200	It's like, but if you're not that person,
749200	750500	if that's not your full function,
750500	753640	if you're not like helping things by blowing that alarm,
753640	755680	or if it's not making you personally happy too,
755680	757080	like there's other shit you could do
757080	759040	with all that stuff coming into you too.
759040	759880	I don't know.
759880	762160	There's this thing, the Jerusalem,
762160	764120	the Trump announcement that he's gonna.
764120	768120	See, he took a bad thing and he made a wonderful, go on.
769240	771280	Where he announced that he's gonna move the US Embassy
771280	773940	to Jerusalem and make a big hubbub
773940	777320	and the world has freaked out about it,
777320	779040	this is to your point,
779040	781520	but the truth is it takes years for that to occur.
781520	783680	He has to get funding, architects have to drop plans,
783680	785340	but people are acting like he's gonna do this
785340	788700	within the next week and that's sort of how we've gotten.
788700	790900	We've gotten to this place where he says something,
790900	792500	somebody says something, we hear something
792500	794500	and we automatically freak out,
794500	796760	not really looking back and being like,
796760	800540	well, no Girl Scout is gonna join the Boy Scouts.
800540	802740	The Boy Scouts just said girls could join.
802740	803580	Right.
803580	807500	And it's because we started off the year so hypersensitive,
807500	809880	which is a reaction to any trauma,
809880	812060	that now when we hear it's raining,
812060	813340	we legitimately are like,
813340	814740	well, it's probably gonna be one of those rains.
815420	816380	So you're exactly right.
816380	818620	I think to our credit, if we are the left,
818620	821700	like I think, I don't think we're actually,
821700	823340	I think a lot of that is like,
823340	828340	we're just so like frustrated waiting for a referee
829020	832080	to blow a whistle that we're just like our boos
832080	836580	are getting louder and we're just incredulous
836580	839260	and we just want at any moment,
839260	840940	we're like, well, maybe this is the thing
840940	843020	because this is like Holy Land,
843020	844940	this is none of his business.
844940	847020	Like I remember in the beginning,
847020	848460	there was a whole buffet set out there.
848460	850660	I would like sit there on Twitter and write these threads
850660	854540	because I was trying to like make my religious relatives
854540	856420	or people that were Christian,
856420	858420	I was trying to go like he would do,
858420	860500	when he missed that prayer breakfast or whatever.
860500	862060	Remember when that was a big deal?
862060	864420	And I was like, aha, so he missed a prayer breakfast.
864420	866820	Now I ask you this, is this man a Christian?
869020	871580	I was really, it was just like all we've been doing
871580	874740	ever since is like, we're just trying to find his off switch.
874740	877020	Now, our trying to find his off switch
877020	878980	is like really making us flail a lot
878980	882220	and I think we should continue to try to find his off switch
882220	884340	but I think we should explore more sides of him
884340	886540	than obviously the front facing side
886540	888540	because I don't think Donald Trump puts his front off switch
888540	889860	on his front facing side.
892220	894860	But more importantly, I mean,
894860	896660	going back to my mechanism metaphor,
896660	900160	clearly this is a man running on our tears.
900160	905160	I mean like we are putting out like terror and sadness
905320	910320	and outrage and it is fueling him.
911400	915280	And that's fine, that doesn't mean stop being outraged,
915280	917040	stop crying, that doesn't mean go numb.
917040	919800	It just means we know that he's already playing
919800	920920	the game I'm describing.
920920	925280	He's a long time ago either by virtue of sociopathology
925280	927560	or some epiphany of his own he had.
927560	930280	He was like, well, why should I keep on,
930280	933720	what am I supposed to shut down every time my mom
933720	935320	yells at me, am I supposed to shut down
935320	937600	every time my dad punches my mom in front of me
937600	939280	and looks at me and says, if you cry
939280	940600	then you're a woman like her.
940600	942200	You know, I'm just speculating what kind of childhood
942200	944200	he probably had given his current pathology.
944200	946200	I took a little bit of psych in high school.
947640	948800	I think something-
948800	950600	College prep?
950600	951440	What's that?
951440	953000	College prep psychology?
953000	955480	Yeah, I think it was worth a college credit possibly.
955480	956320	Yeah.
956640	959880	I mean, this is Milwaukee public schools, I don't think that,
959880	961520	or no, it's Brown Deer.
961520	963280	All right, look, don't write letters.
964280	966120	I'm not a fraud, look into my transcript.
966120	968080	No, you had a class in high school.
968080	969080	I took a psych class.
969080	970880	Yeah, in high school.
970880	972400	I believe it was probably worth a college credit.
972400	973240	I was just-
973240	974080	No.
974080	974920	Okay, it probably wasn't.
974920	977440	Okay, they showed us many, many slideshows
977440	980040	about things like Gestalt.
980040	980880	Right.
984000	986120	I took that class too.
987000	990520	Anyways, this guy, either because he's a monster
990520	992640	or because he's not even gonna say the words,
992640	997640	I guess I am, that he's like more evolved.
999640	1001080	In that respect that he's like,
1001080	1002880	well, what are you supposed to do?
1002880	1004920	Are you supposed to like shut down
1004920	1007080	when someone says you're a racist douchebag?
1007080	1008880	Are you supposed to take that information in
1008880	1010480	and through an elaborate system of mirror,
1010480	1013640	turn it into fucking Trump food and eat it?
1013640	1014640	And that's what he's done.
1014640	1017520	He's like, yes, I'm hearing I'm racist again.
1017520	1020040	I call that a victory.
1020040	1022000	He's generating victory for himself.
1022000	1023240	I don't wanna comment.
1023240	1024920	I don't wanna be his life coach.
1024920	1028880	But we are, most of us aren't dealing with him personally
1028880	1029760	on a day-to-day basis.
1029760	1031720	And what we are dealing with is like mostly for better
1031720	1034160	or for worse, we're dealing with people digitally.
1034160	1037520	And so I just have this epiphany in my head
1037520	1039440	where I'm like, I have been too defensive,
1039440	1042760	too fucking like, it's like,
1042760	1044840	if someone is like feeding into you,
1044840	1046600	they're going like, hey, you're fat,
1046600	1048040	season six of Community Suck,
1048040	1050240	season three of Rick and Morty Suck,
1050240	1054880	you're a cuck, you're, again, with the fat,
1054880	1057480	I can't, you know, people aren't really that,
1057480	1060640	I don't know, they give you,
1060640	1064120	they give you chemicals and a little line
1064120	1066680	that they've stuck into you, you're receiving it.
1066680	1069120	And then you just take it in, you process it.
1069120	1072240	There is like, if somebody says,
1073960	1077200	you know, we should make America great again
1077200	1079320	by getting rid of all the brown people,
1080520	1082720	like, you could process that and go,
1083840	1085680	I think it's great that you think America's great,
1085680	1086760	I love America too.
1088760	1089600	Oh.
1091280	1092120	Now.
1092120	1093560	I'm pretty sure you're talking to a person
1093560	1095200	with a mental disability.
1096440	1098960	At which point to continue to take what they're saying
1099760	1100600	seriously?
1100600	1101920	Well, no, we're not, we're not, we're not,
1101920	1104160	we're not trying, we're not wasting time on this person.
1104160	1105960	You're correct to correct me on that.
1105960	1108760	Once someone calls people brown people,
1108760	1109600	I'm pretty much like, oh, no.
1109600	1110800	Apparently those were my words,
1110800	1112280	I don't know if this person,
1112280	1114760	this motherfucker hates math.
1114760	1116080	First and foremost, you're correct about that,
1116080	1117640	we're not gonna get into arguments with these people,
1117640	1119480	we're not gonna try to change them.
1119480	1120320	Certainly not.
1120320	1122040	But, you know, what we're finding, I think,
1122040	1125440	is that these people, when we do the other thing
1125440	1128000	besides try to change them, which is like,
1128480	1130840	just kind of like fucking, I don't know,
1130840	1134200	whatever you call it, a lot of times I just block them.
1134200	1136360	I don't know, they might be getting energy from that.
1136360	1137320	They are.
1137320	1139000	Yeah, you should mute them instead.
1139000	1139840	They don't know.
1139840	1142520	Yeah, but if you mute them and they directly tweet you,
1142520	1144080	the mute is not function.
1144080	1145800	Not anymore.
1145800	1146840	They upgraded the mute button?
1146840	1149040	As far as I understand, I've never seen anything
1149040	1151520	from a muted person unless I saw it out.
1151520	1152840	But it used to be like that.
1152840	1153680	That's what I do now.
1153680	1155840	Now I have like a thousand muted people.
1156720	1158920	At one point I had 9-11 muted people.
1158920	1163920	I would just mute, I would go through and mute everyone
1164720	1169680	and then unmute you, Elon Musk.
1169680	1170520	People do that.
1170520	1173680	And, yeah, like my girlfriend or whatever,
1173680	1175920	you know, and that would be called, I guess, Facebook?
1175920	1177720	Or like, yeah, pretty much.
1178960	1179800	All right, well.
1179800	1180640	Yeah, there is a little bit,
1180640	1182240	you're correct about the overload.
1183240	1184200	There's a bit of an overload
1184200	1186840	and we are reacting now instinctually
1186840	1188200	without really, you know.
1188200	1189840	I think we're getting more signals.
1189840	1192840	And if, in general, and if more signals are bad
1192840	1194360	and we're used to less signals
1194360	1196200	and now we're getting more bad signals,
1196200	1197920	we're gonna kind of frazzle to some extent.
1197920	1200080	Yeah, it's tough because you start,
1200080	1202480	you wanna, the accurate language you use
1202480	1204400	now all has all these horrible connotations.
1204400	1205800	Because I wanna use a word like trigger.
1205800	1208200	And I wanna say like, in other words, kids,
1208200	1212760	if a stranger has the ability to trigger you
1212760	1217760	into negative behavior,
1218440	1222040	are you a superior machine to the triggering machine?
1222040	1225200	Or are you losing a fucking AI battle?
1225200	1229600	You know, if someone has the ability to shut you down,
1229600	1234600	to make you numb, to make you simply scream
1234760	1237080	at the top of your lungs and point at the thing
1237080	1240840	and say, bad thing, bad thing.
1240840	1242720	There's gray areas here.
1242720	1244200	I don't wanna say that any of those things
1244200	1246920	are necessarily inappropriate responses.
1246920	1251000	But I do, I'm gonna start asking myself the question like,
1251920	1254560	well, do I wanna be a superior machine or not?
1254560	1256600	A superior machine, it's like I'm taking in
1256600	1258680	a little bit of nitrogen, a little bit of oxygen,
1258680	1259920	a little bit of carbon dioxide,
1259920	1262960	a little bit of carbon monoxide, a little bit of aluminum.
1262960	1265000	Like, it's all this like this person
1265000	1267840	just saying some random fucking Second Amendment
1267840	1270840	like a justifying thing or he's a flat earther
1270840	1272640	or he just doesn't like me because I'm fat
1272640	1275680	or I said something bad about Jim Henson once.
1275680	1276960	And they're just trolling me
1276960	1278560	or they're just like barfing up on me.
1278560	1283080	It's like the barf, if I'm a superior machine,
1283080	1285160	there's even if it's one part per billion,
1285160	1286760	there's like nutrition in the barf
1286760	1289280	and I just put it into my little barf processing stomach.
1289280	1290600	Yeah, like dogs.
1290600	1292720	And then the rest passes through me.
1292720	1295160	Well, no wish.
1295160	1298260	So you don't want the, if it's a white suit,
1298260	1299880	everybody's born with a beautiful white suit,
1299920	1302320	we all get our white suits, three piece, it's gorgeous.
1302320	1304000	You wanna try and keep it clean.
1304000	1305960	You wanna try and take care of it, dry clean it
1305960	1306920	when it needs to get dry clean.
1306920	1308400	And if somebody's flinging mud at you,
1308400	1310280	you don't wanna keep visiting that joint
1310280	1312240	because it's about keeping the suit clean.
1312240	1314160	The same thing goes for your mind and your spirit.
1314160	1317200	Yeah, well, you move the mechanism that you are
1317200	1320000	if you're in a place where all the cords connecting to you
1320000	1323160	are 99% barf and 1% nutrition.
1323160	1325280	Yeah, you probably like, you probably pick
1325280	1328640	unless you figure out how to now take on a new organ
1328640	1333640	or something that actually turns barf into sunshine or.
1334360	1337920	Say that once you have barf, you identify that it's barf
1337920	1339280	and you step around it.
1339280	1340600	You don't even try and get the nutrients from barf.
1340600	1343840	Or if you figure out how to turn barf into dramamine.
1343840	1344680	I don't know.
1344680	1346060	And then you put dramamine out
1346060	1347760	and it goes back around the people
1347760	1349640	and they start barfing less.
1349640	1352680	And then it's like, if that is your job,
1352680	1354720	you know, like that's a thing that you are good at
1354720	1355540	and you enjoy doing.
1355540	1358080	You go stand in that place and you collect barf
1358120	1360480	and then you put out this other chemical
1360480	1363320	and then the barf recedes and people that are passing by go,
1363320	1364160	why are you doing that?
1364160	1364980	Don't feed the trolls.
1364980	1366520	And you go like, I'm not, I'm reducing barf.
1366520	1369160	Like you'll thank me later or it's just something
1369160	1370000	I enjoy doing.
1370000	1372240	If you don't enjoy doing it, I think most importantly,
1372240	1374320	like, yeah, you fucking like, you know,
1374320	1379320	you move that factory to a place where the compositions
1379440	1382200	are better enabling you to put out good things.
1382200	1383320	Yes, for sure.
1383320	1384760	We can both agree on that.
1384760	1386240	I just think there are some people out there.
1386240	1388480	I think we could have some of these trolls on our side
1388480	1390960	if they could start to understand that there's like a way,
1390960	1395240	people like, people, there are people that troll
1395240	1400200	because they don't trust, they don't trust dichotomy.
1400200	1401760	They don't trust systems that tell them
1401760	1403360	there's a difference between good and bad
1403360	1405400	and that there's only good and or bad.
1405400	1410400	And those people, they are able to be hypnotized
1410640	1413880	by the bad guys faster than they're able to be yelled at
1413880	1415880	enough by the good guys to pick a side.
1417200	1420080	I think that people who troll are speaking a language
1420080	1422320	that they are used to speaking
1422320	1424400	because they come from negative situations.
1424400	1427080	They don't even know that they're necessarily being negative.
1427080	1429440	I think that if you are a machine,
1429440	1431600	maybe you wanna operate efficiently
1431600	1433760	and that fucking with these trolls is inefficient
1433760	1436600	and takes the energy from your machine, you know?
1436600	1439640	Cause I think that you don't,
1439640	1441840	I'm not trying to save souls necessarily.
1441840	1445600	There's a bunch of people that are worth saving.
1445600	1447400	So I take that level of compassion
1447400	1449080	that you're expressing for these trolls
1449080	1449920	and I give it to people
1449920	1451320	who are actually fighting for good.
1451320	1452160	Yeah, yeah.
1452160	1454800	Well, in that example, then it's like you're, yeah.
1454800	1457440	So you're saying, I Brandon Johnson,
1457440	1460120	my philosophy represented like a 2D overhead map
1460120	1462920	where there's like lichen over here and trolls over here
1462920	1465920	and like, there's a bridge, sunflowers over here.
1465920	1469640	And I was like, you're in a really specific position
1469640	1471120	where you put yourself,
1471120	1473880	where you're able to expose yourself
1473880	1477160	to the ingredients you need to then you're,
1477160	1479920	and then you're pumping help to the people
1479920	1483640	that you are saying deserve it, you know, that need it.
1483640	1485600	Then they're like, oh, if that person needs like me,
1485600	1487520	for instance, if I don't have you in my life,
1487520	1490000	I'd be, my altitude would be lower.
1490000	1493160	You pumped me with levity chemicals.
1493160	1494520	Trying to make me cry, Herman.
1494520	1497080	Trying to make me be a bitch up here.
1497080	1499160	I see you, it's not gonna work.
1499480	1503480	I mean, this epiphany is useless to you.
1503480	1504480	I knew that coming in.
1504480	1506560	Like, this is the epiphany that I needed.
1506560	1507640	No, no, no, I mean, I'm saying like,
1507640	1510080	you're not somebody that's functioning at a low enough level
1510080	1511520	to need this epiphany.
1511520	1514200	Like you, the things that you've said in the past
1514200	1515600	on the show when we get into this area,
1515600	1519520	like, I know you get this.
1519520	1522920	Like, I'm kind of like, I'm getting there now
1522920	1527320	because I'm like, I just, like, I've been to,
1527320	1530640	I just, it's like, why am I letting so many things
1530640	1532880	in an uncontrollable world control me?
1532880	1535400	Well, this is the thing, I think as we get there,
1535400	1536800	because we're always getting there,
1536800	1538360	regardless of what level,
1538360	1540400	one of the things that we pass on is the information.
1540400	1542840	So I'll make this real quick is that
1542840	1545320	we've had to all mobilize, but the older people
1545320	1547080	have had to talk to the younger people about how to do it
1547080	1549240	because they've been fighting for 40, 50 years, right?
1549240	1551440	So like, anybody who's 30 and under
1551440	1552840	didn't know how to get together
1552840	1554400	and rally and do all this shit.
1554400	1556920	So I kind of feel like it's everybody's duty to say,
1556920	1559680	this is the part of the journey that I would do like this,
1559680	1561000	so that you can continue to fight,
1561000	1563640	because you get this thing called oppression fatigue,
1563640	1565920	where you're really tired of taking in all the bad shit
1565920	1567640	and listening and trying to save puppies
1567640	1569280	and people at the same time,
1569280	1571120	and you get this roadmap that says,
1571120	1572840	okay, so this is how you do this.
1572840	1575320	And one of the ways that I always think you do it,
1575320	1579280	just my two cents, having fought for a long time is,
1579280	1581320	you really don't spend time on the people
1581320	1582880	who have very clearly executed
1582880	1584640	that they're not gonna come around.
1585640	1587200	And you really spend more time on the people
1587200	1589640	that are working hard in the streets to do what they do.
1589640	1592480	It's like, you take that compassion for a troll,
1592480	1595200	like I said, and you give it to a mother of three,
1595200	1596760	who's taking a bus every day,
1596760	1598840	and then you really do see it go farther.
1598840	1600680	Like if I save a troll,
1600680	1601960	I don't know that I'm helping anybody,
1601960	1603600	that motherfucker must still be selfish.
1603600	1605720	You aren't even engaging with the troll,
1605720	1607800	you're engaging with like the shark fin
1607800	1609920	that the troll is putting above the water,
1609920	1611560	and they're only putting it above the water
1611560	1614480	because the rest of them is like safe tucked away
1614640	1616920	and is not being engaged with.
1616920	1618640	Like that's what they come for,
1618640	1621720	is just to like do this kind of shark thing.
1621720	1623680	Or if we look at them as machines,
1623680	1625840	because it'll make the metaphor easier for me,
1625840	1630480	like the, there's a,
1630480	1632040	some of the bad guys are like,
1632040	1636600	one of their techniques is to just spray gas into the air,
1636600	1639480	where like no interaction with them whatsoever,
1639480	1640520	and no relationship with them,
1640520	1643440	and no desire for them to be one thing or another.
1643440	1646840	You're just breathing farts everywhere you go.
1646840	1649280	You go to Albertsons and everyone's in a bad mood
1649280	1653200	because just collectively everybody is convinced
1653200	1657600	that the fucking, that everyone hates each other in general.
1657600	1660560	I mean, this is just a function of the new,
1660560	1664560	the new thought wars that we're having, the meme wars,
1664560	1668520	that is like, this is the former Soviet Union
1668520	1671120	like tested this and demonstrated it
1671120	1673160	on all their little satellite states
1673760	1674600	that tried to break ranks.
1674600	1679000	We've watched them hack and fucking troll them and say,
1679000	1680560	you're having a civil war down the street.
1680560	1682040	Your black people don't like your white people.
1682040	1683480	It's happening down the street from you.
1683480	1685480	And the people that are in their homes going like,
1685480	1688200	I don't hear any mortar fire.
1688200	1691200	And it's a massive confusion.
1691200	1692680	Gas, it's just gas.
1692680	1694920	You didn't have to ask for,
1694920	1697720	and so I guess part of my epiphany is like,
1697720	1700600	okay, so the air's changed.
1700600	1701480	It's changed.
1701520	1705400	Okay, so am I a person who's gonna go buy a gun?
1705400	1706480	Yep, yep.
1707480	1709440	But now that I'm thinking about it,
1709440	1713280	like that was my reaction to worrying
1713280	1714520	that people were gonna die,
1714520	1717000	worrying that my family was gonna be safe,
1717000	1718680	worrying that I couldn't take care of my dogs,
1718680	1721400	my housekeeper, my neighborhood, myself.
1721400	1725120	Like I let that fear make me go put money
1725120	1728360	into a mechanism of hatred and violence.
1728360	1732720	And it's because my gauges and pistons and things
1732720	1735720	were poorly designed for this change
1735720	1738840	in chemical compounds in the atmosphere.
1738840	1740040	Not poorly designed.
1740040	1742160	They just needed upgrading.
1742160	1745880	We need to add some, filters feels like,
1745880	1747440	I don't like the word filter
1747440	1749520	because it's part of what the bad guys are doing.
1749520	1752840	Like it's more like, take it all fucking in, take it in.
1754640	1756240	Michael, it's me, Kit.
1756240	1759280	This is the Knight Rider reference, it was a show.
1759280	1764280	Michael, Kit says, I'm detecting a change in the atmosphere.
1765240	1768360	There's like, like take it in and fucking study it.
1768360	1771400	Like, oh, there's a 10% increase in nitrogen
1771400	1773080	and a decrease in oxygen.
1773080	1776640	Okay, I'll work on a schematic for a part of my engine
1776640	1779440	that will take, be nitrogen powered
1779440	1781000	that'll generate more oxygen.
1781000	1783160	Or so it's like, even if that just means like,
1783160	1788160	yeah, you just, yeah, like it starts with self-examination
1791480	1793240	and then it's awareness.
1793240	1794880	It's like, be aware of what's happening to you.
1794880	1797600	It's time to check in with yourself
1797600	1800120	about how you're feeling when you're feeling it.
1800120	1802200	And don't be afraid to say, I feel sad.
1802200	1803840	I feel like I wanna give up.
1803840	1804960	I feel so angry.
1804960	1807200	I thought I wanna smash somebody's face in.
1807200	1809040	But then like, you don't have to do any of that stuff
1809040	1810880	to feel it, that you just examine those feelings
1810880	1813560	and you like have a board meeting inside your heart
1813560	1817480	and go, okay, so we're taking stuff in
1817480	1820520	through our intake valves that are making us violent
1820520	1822160	and fearful and numb.
1823040	1828040	Let's figure out, let's just be aware of that for a week.
1828960	1830800	I wish there was somebody in the room
1830800	1832960	who knew a little bit about what we were talking about.
1832960	1834800	Do you think there is?
1834800	1839080	Well, I think you're recommending a guest order swap.
1839080	1840520	Let's get down with Ben Nelson.
1841240	1844000	All right, well, let's have our first guest come up,
1844000	1845800	Ben Nelson, and I'll tell you
1845800	1847160	what he's doing in a second.
1847160	1848600	Oh, yeah.
1848600	1849440	Oh, yeah.
1849440	1854440	I guess the reason I thought Brandon was recommending
1857480	1861080	a guest swap was because I don't know that Ben Nelson is,
1861080	1863280	I only know what Ben Nelson's objective is
1863280	1866120	in a very, very overview fashion.
1866120	1870160	Your project is a thing called Project Minerva.
1870160	1871440	The Minerva project, yeah.
1871440	1875880	And give us the fucking Wikipedia paragraph that I read,
1877240	1878080	or I will.
1878080	1883080	So Minerva is effectively a way to create a university,
1883520	1884800	the way it's supposed to be.
1884800	1887880	So basically everything that universities say they do,
1887880	1889800	teach people how to think critically,
1889800	1891280	teach people how to problem solve,
1891280	1893680	teach people how to understand other people,
1893680	1896480	interact effectively, communicate effectively,
1896480	1898600	turns out they don't do any of those things.
1898840	1903400	The idea of college, our class shopping carts and stuff,
1903400	1905160	isn't that related to the decline
1905160	1907680	because it's not about a curriculum anymore,
1907680	1909880	it's about selling these digital products
1909880	1912880	that are actually supposedly pieces of an education?
1912880	1913720	Yeah, exactly.
1913720	1916000	Well, and it's not even that anymore
1916000	1918880	because what they're really selling isn't education.
1918880	1921080	I mean, if you think that universities
1921080	1922320	are actually about education,
1922320	1924240	if you think that people choose universities
1924240	1926720	based on education, why are they spending so much money
1926720	1929080	on lazy rivers and campuses and tanning beds
1929080	1929920	and sports teams?
1929920	1931760	They are, in fact, selling you first of all.
1931760	1933720	They're approaching you as a family.
1933720	1934960	They need the kid engaged.
1934960	1935800	They need the kid to say,
1935800	1937400	I want to go to that school because I might get late
1937400	1940240	and I might have fun, I might not kill myself.
1940240	1942360	But simultaneously, the more important part of the family,
1942360	1945920	the parents need to go, oh, and after that, job placement.
1945920	1947560	Yeah, job placement and-
1947560	1948400	I think I was wrong.
1948400	1949240	I think I was wrong from your reaction.
1949240	1950080	You kind of just-
1950080	1952480	So I think there's one other thing,
1952480	1957200	which is that colleges sell different packages
1957200	1958760	to different students.
1958760	1960760	And one of the things that colleges don't talk about,
1960760	1964280	especially the Ivy League, the highly selective schools
1964280	1966160	that claim that they're need-blind,
1966160	1969040	claim that, oh, we don't really look at how wealthy you are,
1969040	1970780	which is a total lie,
1970780	1973520	they sell a very different package to rich kids
1973520	1974640	than they do to everyone else.
1974640	1977080	And the problem is rich kids, the top 1%,
1977080	1979640	are 50% of the students going to these schools.
1979640	1981080	50%, right?
1981080	1983460	And you can't do that if you really need blind.
1983460	1986520	So for them, the pitch is very, very different.
1986520	1989120	The pitch is, look at the theme park
1989120	1990520	that you're gonna be going to.
1990520	1992640	And yeah, you know, you got courses and this and that,
1992640	1993480	you can choose whatever you want,
1993480	1997000	but look, between you and me, slash between everyone,
1997000	1999720	once you get in, there are no Fs.
1999720	2001140	You take whatever courses you want,
2001140	2003680	there's no curriculum, you're guaranteed a diploma.
2003680	2005600	Is that really a thing that's able to be transmitted,
2005600	2008200	dog whistled, if you will, to families?
2008200	2011040	Like for instance, if someone was
2012080	2015280	absolutely 100% observably dyslexic,
2015280	2017680	which is not a crime, geniuses are dyslexic,
2017680	2021240	but someone who has not treated it at all
2021240	2024320	and is therefore functionally illiterate,
2024320	2027320	cannot read a piece of paper publicly
2027320	2028960	without fucking up the words,
2028960	2031920	cannot form sentences without confusing us.
2034040	2036040	But I still wanna be president.
2037000	2038760	Like there are, you're saying that,
2038760	2040200	because this is what boggles my mind,
2040200	2043280	I thought that there were, I mean, you said no Fs.
2043280	2047840	That's actually somehow broadcast out to the families?
2047840	2049560	Like your kid won't get an F here.
2049560	2054440	Yeah, so one shockingly under-reported story
2054440	2055640	from a couple of years ago
2056680	2059400	was a happen at the University of North Carolina.
2059400	2060760	So University of North Carolina,
2060760	2063360	the oldest public university in the United States.
2063360	2065080	Old Miss Daisy.
2065080	2066040	Yeah, there you go.
2067560	2068400	My alma mater.
2070400	2074360	So University of North Carolina discovered,
2074360	2077480	shockingly, three years ago to nobody's knowledge
2077480	2080160	that for the previous 18 years,
2080160	2082120	they invented classes that didn't exist,
2082120	2083680	put them in a course catalog,
2083680	2086280	didn't bother assigning a room to them,
2086280	2088080	because they never met,
2088080	2091720	and they were specifically in place
2091720	2094920	to enable several of their athletes
2095000	2096720	to get phantom A's.
2096720	2099000	Now when this was discovered,
2099000	2102080	it was some secretary deep in the bowels
2102080	2104520	of the organization that took all the blame,
2104520	2107480	and everyone else, the head of the sports department,
2107480	2111400	the provost, the president, no one knew, no one knew, right?
2111400	2114760	And when it was investigated by the accreditors,
2114760	2115960	the people who were supposed to actually
2115960	2117800	be watchdogging these folks,
2117800	2119960	they said, eh, you shouldn't do this again.
2119960	2122720	18 years, they gave away fake degrees.
2122720	2123920	Now people look at this and they say,
2123920	2126320	oh my God, that's like flat out fraud.
2126320	2127280	And was that all athletes?
2127280	2128360	Because I feel like I've seen,
2128360	2131560	I saw Johnny B. Goode with, what's his name,
2131560	2135280	from whatever, Anthony Michael Hall.
2135280	2136680	Sorry, Anthony.
2136680	2138120	You did great in season two.
2142120	2145760	I feel like that's been, since I was a kid,
2145760	2149280	that has always been an athlete thing.
2149280	2151680	It's much more pervasive, and that's the real problem.
2151680	2154600	So the problem is that other universities,
2154600	2156760	who looked at UNC and just passed judgment,
2156760	2160160	said, oh my God, the horror of that,
2160160	2161360	what they've done internally,
2161360	2163840	like if you look at some of the most selective universities
2163840	2166880	in the country, what they do is they just don't issue
2166880	2168440	Fs to anybody, right?
2168440	2170200	So I'll give you the story.
2170200	2171880	Very, very, very selective university.
2171880	2173000	You've all heard the name.
2173000	2177040	I will protect the guilty by leaving out their name.
2177040	2180080	I had a friend who was a teaching assistant there.
2180320	2183000	And I'm not gonna say exactly where, but, you know.
2183000	2184440	It rhymes with Garver.
2184440	2186040	It rhymes with Mayo.
2186040	2191040	So the very short version is that their rule was
2191520	2193480	that you basically, you only got grades based on tests,
2193480	2195760	and if you missed two of the tests,
2195760	2197080	it's 100% the final.
2197080	2199960	And there was a girl who missed both the midterms
2199960	2202720	and then skipped the final.
2202720	2204480	They didn't take any of the tests.
2204480	2206840	So when it was time to give her grades,
2206840	2208840	the TA gave her an F, and the professor,
2208840	2212040	when he looked at the F, he said, who got an F?
2212040	2215120	He said, this is a girl, they didn't take a single test.
2215120	2217200	And he said, yeah, that's a C plus.
2218800	2219920	C plus!
2219920	2222200	Now, is this, so...
2222200	2224760	That happened to me, I think, in astrology.
2226840	2229400	I definitely got an F on a test, and I was like, C.
2229400	2233480	And it was like, well, that didn't happen.
2233480	2237000	Okay, so in that example, that's a real life example.
2237000	2237840	Real life example.
2238840	2243680	So now, just tell us, why?
2243680	2245000	Who's that girl?
2245000	2246480	Why is that professor doing that?
2246480	2248240	Well, he did that because, actually,
2248240	2250320	the rules of the university,
2250320	2252080	so in elite institutions,
2252080	2255280	when you wanna have half of your students to be rich,
2255280	2258280	you're gonna have to make a lot of exceptions,
2258280	2260040	even at the very best universities.
2260040	2260960	That makes sense.
2260960	2262520	Damn it, I went to fuckin' Marquette,
2262520	2264120	and I had to drop out, I got an F in English,
2264120	2265920	because they busted my balls!
2265920	2267720	You didn't go to an elite institution.
2268560	2269800	My grade went down, I think,
2269800	2272520	I was like, this is harder than high school!
2272520	2273800	So actually, that's the sad part,
2273800	2275000	because the higher you climb,
2275000	2276800	the more this grade inflation is occurring.
2276800	2279480	Oh my, always knew it,
2279480	2282320	never heard it from a qualified individual.
2282320	2285200	Now, does this have anything to do with loans?
2285200	2286040	Well, not so much,
2286040	2288600	because these schools don't really give out loans, right?
2288600	2290960	Because, and especially to the students that,
2290960	2294080	you know, can afford to pay $70,000 a year.
2294080	2295200	Who can do that?
2295200	2296240	Half of their students.
2296240	2297080	Wow.
2297960	2302080	Fuckin' idiots, we've raised a nation of rich idiots.
2302080	2303840	Privileged rich idiots.
2303840	2306560	Privileged, and not necessarily smarter,
2306560	2308200	or better equipped to go into the workforce?
2308200	2309040	No, not at all.
2309040	2312600	I mean, in fact, if you look at how employers
2312600	2315080	rate the quality of graduates from universities,
2315080	2316960	it's abysmal, abysmal.
2316960	2320080	96% of chief academic officers at universities
2320080	2322560	say that they prepare their students well for the job,
2322560	2323760	right, the job force.
2323760	2325360	This is what parents really care about.
2325360	2327480	11% of employers agree.
2327480	2328320	Right.
2328320	2329160	11%.
2329160	2330000	Yeah, I mean, I think that's been,
2330000	2331680	that's been like the last 10 years or so,
2331680	2332880	it's like that bubble burst,
2332880	2335040	where somebody bothered, as with Enron,
2335040	2338480	somebody finally said, come on, we need to see a ledger.
2338480	2340160	And then after a lot of hemming and hogging,
2340160	2342400	it's like, yeah, no, no one gets a job
2342400	2344840	that went to college, basically, you,
2344840	2348040	but however, there's a meta channel to that,
2348040	2351480	which is if you can afford to send your kid to Harvard,
2351480	2352320	correct me if I'm wrong,
2352320	2354840	I'm gonna get a little classist here,
2354960	2357040	in the opposite direction.
2357040	2359400	If you can afford to send your kid to Harvard,
2361920	2363920	and you don't send your kid to Harvard,
2366280	2367680	you're kneecapping your kid,
2367680	2369560	because your kid's a member of the 1%.
2369560	2371400	He's garbage larva.
2371400	2376400	He's blue blood Mayflower fucking parasitic DNA.
2377200	2380000	And he needs his Harvard UV ray
2380000	2381880	that is tanning booth to pass through,
2381880	2384560	so he can be a baked in Harvard fucking moron
2384600	2388640	and go get his oil wells and his fucking shit back.
2388640	2390040	So I got good news for you.
2390040	2391760	I got good news for you, that's a myth.
2391760	2393480	Okay, all right.
2393480	2395400	So actually somebody did that study.
2395400	2398720	They looked at people accepted by Harvard,
2398720	2399920	all the people accepted by Harvard,
2399920	2402240	and they looked at the people who chose not to go
2402240	2403880	and compared them to the people who went.
2403880	2407760	Turns out that if you are from the top four
2407760	2410280	of the five socioeconomic strata,
2410280	2412600	so basically the top 80%,
2412640	2415360	it makes zero difference whether or not
2415360	2417400	you chose to go to Harvard or to state school.
2417400	2419080	Where it does help, and it does help,
2419080	2421320	is if you come from the 20% poorest households
2421320	2422160	in the country,
2422160	2425080	which make up a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction
2425080	2427320	of Harvard students,
2427320	2429200	those students actually do have
2429200	2432680	some better future earnings, et cetera,
2432680	2433920	if they went to Harvard Path versus not,
2433920	2435240	but it's not that much.
2435240	2437760	And it's usually because they started out at zero.
2437760	2440280	Correct, because they started out with a huge, huge,
2440480	2442560	huge amount of downside,
2442560	2444160	and they do meet some people that will help them out.
2444160	2445480	So that does help.
2445480	2447520	But guess what?
2447520	2450080	What makes you successful in life?
2450080	2452360	And this is actually a damnation of universities,
2452360	2454200	because I don't think it should be this way.
2454200	2455400	But what makes you successful in life
2455400	2457480	is just how good you are, right?
2457480	2459600	But what universities should be doing
2459600	2461320	is they should actually be adding value.
2461320	2463160	They should actually be teaching to do those things.
2463160	2464000	It should be places where you go,
2464000	2466240	and you go, I don't know, I play a little bit of piano,
2466240	2468680	but I've always liked English class.
2468680	2470120	I came here to be a journalist major.
2470840	2472480	And they go, wrong, you're Billy Joel.
2472480	2474280	And they funnel, and they make you into Billy Joel.
2474280	2476320	That's what any school should be.
2476320	2478200	That's what any household should be.
2478200	2480040	Your kid should be born with proclivities
2480040	2482280	that are natural, interests that are natural.
2482280	2483880	Sometimes those are contrasting.
2483880	2485520	You put a piano in front of your kid.
2485520	2487840	You put a football in front of your kid.
2487840	2492360	You put a lock pick in front of your kid.
2492360	2494080	It's just in D&D terms.
2494080	2495520	Maybe they're gonna be an expert thief.
2495520	2496360	Yes.
2497240	2499720	And they respond to stuff and they don't respond to stuff.
2500680	2502320	And you break all, by the way, as a subset of that.
2502320	2504520	You break all gender norms and all that stuff
2504520	2507000	because regardless of what we think about this stuff.
2507000	2508800	Anyways, but who cares?
2508800	2510080	I'm patting myself on the back for,
2510080	2512240	what am I barfing you at?
2512240	2513880	I'm very curious about one thing
2513880	2515560	because I just want to make sure I got the picture here.
2515560	2517560	Because that girl in that example,
2517560	2520240	when that professor says that F is actually a C plus,
2520240	2522240	is he saying that because of that girl's background,
2522240	2524080	or is he, or is it just because there's a rule?
2524080	2525480	So the rule is in order.
2525480	2527640	Poor kids are benefiting from the no F process.
2527680	2528520	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2528520	2529360	Everybody goes to C schools.
2529360	2530200	Because they're customers.
2530200	2531040	Benefit, they're customers, right?
2531040	2532280	So nobody wants to get out cold happy mail.
2532280	2534160	Well, the teachers, they get rated
2534160	2535560	on how good their students do.
2535560	2536960	Bingo, bingo.
2536960	2538640	And so in order to give the girl an F,
2538640	2540040	there is a way to give her an F.
2540040	2541440	After she missed the first midterm,
2541440	2544400	they had to call her into a teacher student conference
2544400	2548280	and have a written down corrective action plan.
2548280	2551080	Even though in the rules, she could have missed the midterm.
2551080	2553360	Then after she missed the second midterm,
2553360	2555040	they had to bring her back in
2555040	2557520	and have her sign on a different corrective action plan
2558280	2559120	because the first one clearly didn't work.
2559120	2563440	And then, and only then, if she then misses the final,
2563440	2566080	just doesn't show up, then they can give her an F.
2566080	2568360	People don't bother doing it, right?
2568360	2570400	And so, but there's one other thing
2570400	2571600	that universities should be doing,
2571600	2572680	which is what you were talking about
2572680	2574080	at the beginning of the show,
2574080	2576440	which is those filters, right?
2576440	2579180	The ways they train your mind
2579180	2581500	to deal with what comes at you,
2581500	2583440	that is the job of universities.
2583440	2586320	That is the definition of higher education.
2586320	2587600	Universities don't do that.
2587600	2591120	And instead, we're giving C pluses to absolute morons
2591120	2592560	that can go on to become legislators,
2592560	2596280	and we're giving also, look, I'll say it.
2596280	2597520	I'm gonna sound like one of the bad guys.
2597520	2599800	We're giving safe spaces to kids that complain
2599800	2601320	that catcher and the rhyme made them uncomfortable
2601320	2602560	because it has the word fag in it.
2602560	2603400	Absolutely.
2603400	2605360	Well, this seems all pretty terrible.
2605360	2606400	Yeah.
2606400	2610080	I wish there was someone here that had a plan
2610080	2611640	because we were good at complaining,
2611640	2614560	but if only there was someone, help me.
2614560	2617000	There's gotta be a better way.
2617000	2620160	I wanna know how we got here and where we're going.
2622160	2623600	Where are we going?
2623600	2627040	So we believe that we've sketched out something that works.
2627040	2628520	You and your improv troupe.
2628520	2630000	Exactly, right.
2630000	2631840	We have a whole group of people now.
2631840	2633560	So we actually started a new university.
2633560	2635400	We started a new university program
2635400	2637440	that's actually part of the KGI,
2637440	2638560	which is one of the Claremont Colleges
2638560	2640120	here in Southern California.
2641040	2646040	And our students go through a completely reimagined
2647160	2648680	four-year undergraduate curriculum.
2648680	2651720	It's accredited, it's very, very selective,
2651720	2652800	very hard to get in,
2652800	2657200	but unlike the traditional profile of other universities,
2657200	2659240	we just choose not to discriminate.
2659240	2661040	It was an odd choice.
2661040	2663520	And so we charge for-
2663520	2665240	Even if they're black?
2665240	2666520	Across the board, right?
2666520	2667880	You mean you don't discriminate
2667880	2669960	among the different kinds of black people
2670960	2671800	for the black people program?
2671800	2673520	There's no black person program.
2673520	2674360	What about the-
2674360	2675600	Well, how do you tell the black students from the-
2675600	2676440	We don't.
2676440	2678800	So here's the crazy thing about what we do.
2678800	2680160	Here's the crazy thing about what we do.
2680160	2681640	We have no quotas.
2681640	2682960	We have no buckets.
2682960	2684040	We have no slots.
2684040	2687480	We don't say, oh, you have to compete for this position.
2687480	2689160	If you qualify for a program,
2689160	2690240	it's very hard to qualify to,
2690240	2693200	but if you qualify, you get in, okay?
2693200	2695680	And we charge for tuition fees room and board,
2695680	2698000	the whole thing, less than $30,000 a year.
2698000	2700520	So less than half of what the Ivy League charge, right?
2700520	2702120	Which is 60 to 70,000 now.
2703000	2705240	And despite the fact that we charged less than half,
2705240	2707440	80% of our students can't afford it.
2707440	2709160	What's a state school cost?
2709160	2710320	About the same.
2710320	2712600	And that's subsidized by the government, we're not.
2712600	2714280	Sorry, I've got to pick my nose right on camera
2714280	2715720	because it's just, there's a trap door booger.
2715720	2717480	And look, I can either live with it
2717480	2718320	or I can fucking confront it.
2718320	2719280	You have to do something about it.
2719280	2720560	Now it's gone.
2720560	2722960	I'll let Reddit show that in replay.
2722960	2724880	I picked my nose.
2724880	2725840	I do it with my thumb.
2725840	2728280	That's why my nose looks like Harrison Ford's at 44.
2728280	2732960	Now, would a guy like me make it into your program?
2735720	2739800	So I want to try to, I'm going to try to recap
2739800	2741760	what you said so that we can try,
2741760	2743160	because I'm dumb and drunk.
2743160	2748160	And you're saying that you, because first of all,
2748960	2752000	you haven't built a brick and mortar building yet,
2752000	2754360	where you're saying you're using existing universities,
2754360	2755960	but you started a program.
2755960	2757120	We started an undergraduate program.
2757120	2758880	Yeah, and what we do is rather than using
2758880	2760320	kind of a campus-based philosophy,
2760320	2761600	we use a city-based philosophy.
2761600	2763760	So our students, they actually spend their first year,
2763760	2765960	not in Southern California, but in San Francisco.
2765960	2768520	And they live in a residence hall in the middle of the city.
2768520	2771400	And then the next three years, they travel as a group.
2771400	2773640	They live in six different countries all over the world.
2773640	2774480	What?
2774480	2776440	So they go from San Francisco, they go to Seoul,
2776440	2779280	Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires, London, Taipei,
2779280	2780880	and they come back to San Francisco to graduate.
2780880	2782600	Are you a Bond villain?
2782640	2786120	Well, I'm not, but perhaps our students will be Bond heroes.
2786120	2787480	Finally, they're placed in a pit,
2787480	2790200	in a broken pool queue between them.
2790200	2793480	The one super student that emerges from that pit
2793480	2794560	goes to the moon.
2796560	2798680	Actually, he gets to go to Harvard.
2798680	2801720	No, but I just want to, because please forgive me.
2801720	2805400	I'm saying, so you're saying it's a program,
2805400	2806240	it's not a school.
2806240	2808080	It's not a geographically located thing.
2808080	2808920	It's a program.
2808920	2809760	It's geographically located.
2809760	2811280	It's just not located in a campus.
2811400	2812960	It's located in the cities.
2812960	2815720	Okay, but everywhere these people are going,
2815720	2820720	the faculty, you're not invading existing schools
2821480	2823960	and saying, let us piggyback on your infrastructure.
2823960	2826120	You have your own teachers, your own curriculum.
2826120	2827520	We have our own professors, our own curriculum,
2827520	2829480	and the curriculum, the way it's structured is,
2829480	2832680	in the first year, they spend the entire first year
2832680	2834200	training their minds.
2834200	2836600	They learn four systems of thought.
2836600	2838560	We're talking about complex systems, basically.
2838560	2839860	We're talking about, at the beginning,
2840180	2842460	how we are all complex systems, right?
2842460	2845820	Anywhere from people to animals to...
2845820	2847500	The first year is how to think.
2847500	2849820	The first year is systems of thinking, right?
2849820	2852260	So, how to use logic and reasoning and statistics.
2852260	2854580	How to look at the world around you
2854580	2857500	and understand how things work when data isn't clear.
2857500	2860020	How to think about unintended consequences
2860020	2861020	and effective interactions.
2861020	2863300	How to think about how to communicate effectively.
2863300	2865340	So, one of the things that you were talking about
2865340	2866500	is one of the things we actually teach.
2866500	2868340	It's called audience, right?
2868340	2871300	Hashtag audience, which is a habit of mind
2871300	2874740	to understand who it is that you're talking to
2874740	2876540	before you start talking, right?
2876540	2879040	To actually understand, how are they going to receive
2879040	2880500	what I'm saying?
2880500	2883300	And, by the way, there's the corollary to that,
2883300	2886540	which is, why are they saying those things to me?
2886540	2887420	What are they actually...
2887420	2889820	What is the question behind the question
2889820	2891540	or the statement behind the statement?
2891540	2893020	So, that's like communication theory and stuff.
2893020	2894900	So, that's part of effective communication.
2894900	2896300	Well, that seems like that's compatible
2896300	2899300	with modern problematization.
2899300	2904300	Yes, to pronounce it in the original French.
2905980	2910380	Problematization, which I heard a student
2910380	2911820	telling me, explaining to me about
2911820	2913900	that you're picking apart things and then I looked it up.
2913900	2914740	Like, what is this?
2914740	2917100	It's like a sort of digestive process
2917100	2918420	of any piece of information.
2918420	2919820	You can just look around your world
2919820	2920860	and start corroding it.
2920860	2921700	Correct.
2921700	2922540	Which...
2922540	2924420	And you don't like the word filter, which is right.
2924420	2926100	I think about it as lenses.
2926300	2928540	We give you a hundred different lenses
2928540	2930260	to sharpen your view of the world.
2930260	2931660	Don't lenses filter light?
2931660	2933060	Okay.
2933060	2933900	That's true.
2933900	2935940	They focus, they focus, they focus light, right?
2935940	2937540	Okay, I'm just saying, don't...
2937540	2939420	But it is fantastic to...
2939420	2941980	Yeah, because I feel like if there's one thing,
2941980	2943820	often with this, I'm Generation X,
2943820	2945740	I'm the David Cross, Jeanine Garofalo,
2946820	2948340	Brandon Johnson generation.
2952020	2954820	I floated my boat for the longest time.
2954820	2955980	Brandon and I have talked about this,
2956620	2958420	how our generation kind of...
2958420	2961820	We weren't like millennials,
2961820	2965020	however we were, you know, lazy is lazy.
2965020	2968380	Like we learned how to be anti-corporate when we were 25.
2968380	2971860	We learned how Jamba Juice is just fucking bullshit.
2971860	2972700	It's all sugar.
2972700	2974860	Everything with a little C in a circle
2974860	2976460	or a TM on it is bullshit
2976460	2977580	and everything corporate is bullshit.
2977580	2979060	Money is bullshit and all this stuff.
2979060	2980740	We didn't...
2980740	2982740	And then the millennials started rubbing us the wrong way
2982740	2984460	because they're like, I don't know, I love recycling.
2984460	2985540	I mean, if the president tells me to do it,
2985980	2986820	my mom's my best friend,
2986820	2988460	and they're like, these people are gonna be fascists
2988460	2990500	if they intersect with the right president.
2990500	2992020	And I am on record in this podcast
2992020	2993300	as saying that if you can bear it,
2993300	2995660	scroll back through this horrible fucking podcast.
2995660	2996940	However, I also went and bought a gun
2996940	2998260	and some things didn't go my way.
2998260	3000220	I've also said horrible things and made rape jokes.
3000220	3002260	All right, so don't go back, don't go back.
3003780	3007820	But like the place where we intersect is,
3007820	3011900	I think like our generation, my generation is like,
3012740	3015980	that's like a little bit of paprika, a little pepper.
3015980	3018420	It's like, could we please just change lenses constantly
3018420	3020500	and always look at everything and see who's gaining
3020500	3022340	and who's losing and question everything
3022340	3024660	and kind of like be jaded about it a little bit?
3024660	3026300	Absolutely.
3026300	3027300	But you don't need to be jaded.
3027300	3029660	You have to actually just look at it.
3029660	3031860	You actually have to get down to the core
3031860	3033100	of what the issues are, right?
3033100	3035660	And I think that's actually where our generation,
3035660	3036660	we were primed.
3036660	3039820	I think probably this is why I came up with this concept,
3039820	3041340	which is when I went to college,
3041340	3042620	that's what I was primed for.
3042620	3044060	I was primed for exactly that.
3044060	3045180	I wanted to go to college.
3045180	3047300	Well, in movies and TV, that's what it always is.
3047300	3049900	It's always like these crazy thematic John Hausman's
3049900	3052660	at the front going, I expect you to work
3052660	3054340	so much harder than you ever.
3054340	3056140	And then like the people turn their papers in
3056140	3058780	and it's like, look, sorry, professor,
3058780	3060180	I just didn't agree with you on this one.
3060180	3062260	And that is why you got an A.
3062260	3064860	You know, like everything, like colleges
3064860	3068100	as depicted in our culture are these places
3068100	3071980	where you're fucking, the bullshit starts off campus.
3071980	3075740	That's why Kent State, that's why Kent State tipped off.
3075740	3080540	It's like they fucking invaded the goddamn Pentagon
3080540	3083580	of culture, our children, our youth.
3083580	3085700	Like you're allowed to protest, you're allowed
3085700	3088260	and then they sent the National Guard onto a campus
3088260	3091260	and someone got shot and it was like, this is over now.
3091260	3092300	You fucked up.
3092300	3095220	Just as when a journalist getting shot in the roaring 20s,
3095220	3097380	this is the reason organized crime got shut the fuck down.
3097380	3098660	You shot a journalist.
3098660	3100740	It was like always there was this respect
3100740	3103820	for these things that should have kept me safe.
3106500	3108260	This is a heavy podcast.
3108260	3109660	No, it's a selfish one.
3109660	3111780	It's where I come to like, like I just plea
3111780	3112620	with the cameras.
3112620	3114020	I go, can you hear the shelling?
3114020	3115900	Someone send me blood.
3115900	3117300	But I just.
3117300	3119300	Someone sent us blood.
3119300	3120140	What are you Dan?
3120140	3121700	I'm an O positive.
3121700	3122540	You know what?
3122540	3125100	I think you should be a little more O negative sometimes.
3125100	3126900	That's the problem with your generation.
3127380	3133020	The so so so how OK.
3133020	3134900	I want to I want to continue to talk to you.
3134900	3135820	We have a full show tonight.
3135820	3137020	We've also got I think somebody that's
3137020	3138100	going to blend very well with you.
3138100	3140300	I think either that or we're going to get the tanks are
3140300	3142460	going to roll through the building once once the two of
3142460	3143420	you are together.
3143420	3148340	But I just want to like like just a little personal
3148340	3148940	background.
3148940	3149500	Come on.
3149500	3150380	Come on, Ben Nelson.
3150380	3152020	Stop avoiding intimacy.
3152020	3153780	Who are you?
3153780	3156260	How'd you end up on this war path?
3156260	3157420	How'd I end up on the war path?
3157420	3158780	It was it was pretty simple.
3158780	3163820	I mean I was so went to college idealistic 18 year old assuming
3163820	3166100	John Houseman will be teaching me all of my classes.
3166100	3169540	But also that you'd be allowed to be John Kuzak in a sure
3169540	3170620	thing.
3170620	3172740	That was the other half of the college dream was that you
3172740	3177740	could go you know what I'm a fucking whiz English major.
3177740	3181180	I'm going to I'm going to skip the midterm but I'm going to
3181180	3184820	make it up on the you know it's like you cut classes and that
3184820	3186300	was part of your grown up now.
3186300	3187700	You're not a high school student anymore.
3187700	3188300	You're an adult.
3188300	3190780	You make your choices and they're like a lot of college
3190780	3193380	dramas would feature that moment where the kid would have
3193380	3194020	to come to terms.
3194020	3196100	It's like yeah but you're scheduling your time and you're
3196100	3197020	picking your priorities.
3197020	3197220	Yeah.
3197220	3200060	And in fact I found that I could schedule my time completely
3200060	3202540	because I never needed to go to class because the classes were
3202540	3204460	I mean they just read books out loud to you and I could read
3204460	3205100	them on my own.
3205100	3205980	Yeah.
3205980	3208060	That's what my college experience was like.
3208060	3208340	Yeah.
3208340	3209580	And I didn't like that.
3209580	3209940	No.
3209940	3211060	I wanted to learn something.
3211060	3212660	I could just buy a textbook.
3212660	3213340	Exactly.
3213340	3213620	Right.
3213620	3217580	And so I thought that you know choice and in college should be
3217580	3220500	made when I was ready for it.
3220500	3220740	Right.
3220740	3223540	I'm actually not a big fan of choice right at the beginning
3223540	3224900	because I'm still a kid.
3224900	3225100	Yeah.
3225100	3225500	Right.
3225500	3227940	Freshman year I have no idea what I'm doing at that point.
3227940	3230740	High schools over you piece of shit and part of that
3230740	3236460	should be like the mom a cat like drops a crippled mouse
3236460	3238100	like not a dead one.
3238100	3238780	Yeah.
3238780	3243100	Meaning you can you're going to you can go do stand up Wednesday
3243100	3244060	nights.
3244060	3244540	Right.
3244540	3244900	Right.
3244900	3247660	And then your grades going to lower down just a little bit.
3247660	3250220	You're going to get enough you can make those choices.
3250220	3251060	Exactly.
3251060	3254180	But I'm just saying I should have I should have I should have
3254180	3256740	better grades at Marquette if there's one thing we can
3256740	3257740	establish.
3257740	3260420	I should not have gotten an F in English for the record it is.
3260420	3264060	I've been walking around that I need to go to gimlet media
3264060	3267580	with my heavy weight episode about how I need to confront my
3267580	3268620	college TA.
3268620	3268900	All right.
3268900	3269980	Why did you well real quick.
3269980	3270740	Why did you get enough.
3270740	3272980	It was a systemic thing was like were you not
3273100	3277180	literally they tell you your grade drops a grade level if you
3277180	3278740	if you skip a class.
3278740	3279020	OK.
3279020	3280620	So right there I'm dead.
3280620	3281180	Yeah.
3281180	3282380	Because that's amazing.
3282380	3283980	I never had that skill.
3283980	3287260	They were also starting a new thing on cooperative education
3287260	3289340	which is where the class shows up.
3289340	3290300	There's a TA.
3290300	3293980	The TA breaks everybody into groups and the group gets a
3293980	3295300	grade shares a grade.
3295300	3295700	Oh yeah.
3295700	3295980	Right.
3295980	3296420	Sure.
3296420	3301500	So that was very offensive to my young like if if you had
3301500	3305820	transplanted me into today like I was you know like yeah I
3305820	3308580	was like I wasn't at risk of all right.
3308580	3311220	You know like indoctrination but see here's here's what I would
3311220	3311900	make the argument.
3311900	3315860	I would recommend that if if your university did its job you
3315860	3317580	wouldn't have missed any classes.
3317580	3320140	You would have gone to class because it would have actually
3320140	3321940	you would have seen your mind develop.
3321940	3325940	You'd say oh my God I am smarter this week than I was last week
3325940	3327860	and I'm not going to miss out on that opportunity.
3327860	3330380	And sometimes you do have to put in some structure.
3330380	3333180	The problem is when you put in structure and then the university
3333180	3335700	doesn't deliver you got to show up and then you show up and you're
3335700	3340500	like you show up and then your TA is reading Ray Bradbury and like
3340500	3344420	texting while you sit in a circle of desks with all your fellow
3344420	3346340	freshmen going I don't know what you want to do.
3346340	3349620	Oh you want to do exactly exactly what if we wrote a paper about
3349620	3350100	licorice.
3350100	3353980	Oh OK.
3353980	3355980	So not to avoid intimacy.
3355980	3359260	I I came up with this idea when I was a freshman.
3359260	3361780	Basically how to fix the curriculum of my university.
3361780	3365380	And I spent four years trying to argue for people to listen.
3365380	3366220	Nobody cared.
3366220	3369740	Oh they must have loved you care care care.
3369740	3372340	And now that I'm here I'd like to put up some wallpaper.
3375900	3379620	So you know I tried for four years and I gave up.
3379620	3381700	And I said what can I do.
3381700	3382580	I couldn't do anything.
3382580	3384940	I was all these committees and all the rest.
3384940	3386220	Nothing could happen.
3386220	3389700	So I gave up and I said you know I think education is kind of
3389700	3390780	important.
3390780	3393020	I think it's kind of important for universities to actually
3393020	3394260	educate students.
3394260	3396980	And my guess is this is going to have some bad effects in the
3396980	3398060	real world.
3398060	3400020	But who knows.
3400020	3400620	Right.
3400620	3401180	What do I know.
3401180	3403860	I'm an uneducated 21 year old.
3403860	3405660	I just have a university degree.
3405660	3408420	So I went out into the real world and then I encountered human
3408420	3409780	beings.
3409780	3414220	And I encountered human beings in positions of pretty dramatic
3414220	3416380	levels of decision making.
3416380	3419020	And they were intelligent high IQ.
3419020	3420340	They were well meaning.
3420340	3421380	They wanted to do good things.
3421380	3425940	And they were making awful awful decisions that impacted a
3425940	3427540	lot of people's lives.
3427540	3427820	Right.
3427820	3430700	I saw it in the working world corporate world.
3430700	3432900	People were like making decisions and companies were
3432900	3436220	going out of business and making bone headed moves.
3436220	3437580	Saw it obviously in politics.
3437580	3439580	I saw it everywhere.
3439580	3443060	And it just got worse and worse and worse.
3443060	3449820	And by the way it wasn't even a partisan thing.
3449820	3456380	I can even track when era has gone by when you look fondly
3456380	3460700	back at any government that we had over the past 20 some
3460700	3464780	years and you say well look you had Congress controlled on
3464780	3466540	the right, on the left, et cetera.
3466540	3469540	You never look back and say oh my god boy wasn't that like a
3469540	3471780	look at what the House of Representatives
3471780	3474860	was able to do in 1996 or what did the Senate be able to do
3474860	3476820	in 2002 or 2007.
3476820	3480780	These were generally not well functioning organizations.
3480780	3482380	Right.
3482380	3486260	And they've just gotten progressively worse over time.
3486260	3488540	You are an educational activist.
3488540	3489900	Yeah, absolutely.
3489900	3491540	You're a disruptor.
3491540	3493140	No, we don't.
3493140	3494340	You're an obstructionist.
3494340	3495500	We don't believe in disruption.
3495500	3496740	We want to reform.
3496740	3497700	We want to reform.
3497700	3501340	Yeah, that's super interesting because nobody is standing up
3501340	3504940	for the rest of us in terms of getting educated.
3504940	3507100	And it does seem as though universities have gotten more
3507100	3511980	about can we do business in terms of agriculture?
3511980	3514740	Can we do medicine?
3514740	3517260	Can we do law?
3517260	3518660	Can we do business?
3518660	3519940	They don't do architecture.
3519940	3521140	They don't do dance.
3521140	3522500	They don't do art anymore.
3522500	3525580	They don't do any of the things that really fuel those three
3525580	3527340	things that I listed initially.
3527340	3529940	And again from our perspective, totally right.
3529940	3534540	And the most tragic, they no longer do general education.
3534540	3537860	General education is the most important role
3537860	3540220	of an undergraduate degree.
3540220	3543540	That's why it's called an undergraduate degree.
3543540	3546860	It's supposed to train the mind so that when you then figure out
3546860	3549180	what you want to do, you go to get a graduate degree,
3549180	3551260	or you go into the workforce, or what have you,
3551260	3554380	and then use the general systemic thinking,
3554380	3556340	those general ideas in the world.
3556340	3560060	It goes back to capitalism.
3560060	3562260	Well, that's an easy thing to say.
3562260	3568300	Because it goes back to when I'm 15 years old in 1989
3568300	3572260	in Brown Deer, Wisconsin, it's happening around me.
3572260	3573180	I'm not aware of it yet.
3573180	3575780	But looking back on it, I'm aware that programs
3575780	3577340	are being lifted and pulled.
3577340	3580780	Now, some of them are, well, actually, at that time,
3580780	3582620	all the programs that were being lifted and pulled
3582620	3584460	were like trade programs.
3584460	3587180	My best friend Dave Friedl, who's
3587180	3588700	been on the podcast and stuff, he
3588700	3595020	was a huge beneficiary of the just the program
3595020	3597300	at my high school, where if you were really
3597300	3600940	interested in food service, you could take classes
3600940	3602940	at our high school, and then there was an internship,
3602940	3603620	and there was all these things.
3603620	3606340	And he was like one of the last people through that shoot,
3606340	3610540	and was able to, he's not now Wolfgang Puck.
3610540	3614220	He's now a fucking coder and an assistant, whatever.
3614700	3618100	He's got a digital job.
3618100	3620900	But he was able to not slip through the cracks
3620900	3628340	and fall into fucking hell, because he had a different kind
3628340	3632420	of, he didn't excel on tests or in geometry or whatever,
3632420	3635700	but he was fucking nailing it in these food service classes.
3635700	3638580	And there was programs in every public high school,
3638580	3642860	there would be tendrils going into, oh, you're a dirtball?
3642860	3645940	That's what I affectionately call them.
3645940	3648340	We have a fucking auto shop at our high school,
3648340	3650780	and then also we have paths for you.
3650780	3653900	They are not like in the old world European class system,
3653900	3656260	like, oh, you were born in this tax bracket,
3656260	3657820	so you're going to be a mechanic.
3657820	3660860	It's more like, hey, you can't stop
3660860	3663340	making horrible jokes to the teacher after class,
3663340	3667300	and you don't also care about isosceles triangles.
3667300	3671060	But there are opportunities.
3671660	3674820	There's fingers everywhere for all of our kids
3674820	3677620	that you could end up being a genius,
3677620	3680180	proving that you were a genius in something that wasn't
3680180	3683260	necessarily testing well in this or that area.
3683260	3686900	That's what was happening when I was 15,
3686900	3687980	going on all around me.
3687980	3690140	Then the follow up to that is really
3690140	3692980	that they started caving in on the other side.
3692980	3695380	The school papers started shutting down.
3695380	3699380	The first time after I went to visit my school paper editor,
3699380	3700740	he's like, no, no more school paper.
3701060	3705060	One of the last ones, we don't train kids
3705060	3706420	to be creative anymore.
3706420	3708300	We train them to pass English tests.
3708300	3710060	Now, the obvious answer to all of this,
3710060	3711820	and we've all watched everyone in my audience
3711820	3713180	probably seen these documentaries,
3713180	3717140	it's because of the government agencies,
3717140	3721660	who are, I guess, accountable to their voters,
3721660	3723780	then they'd say to the school districts,
3723780	3727540	oh, you have to make your kids smarter.
3727540	3729580	They're terrible people now.
3729620	3731620	They're rapists and murderers and carjackers.
3731620	3732740	Make them smarter.
3732740	3734980	And then the schools go, OK, we're going to,
3734980	3736900	and then this weird thing happens
3736900	3739300	where the tests become, everyone's just
3739300	3740700	being trained to pass tests.
3740700	3743780	Otherwise, the schools lose their funding and all this stuff.
3743780	3748100	Then meanwhile, on the 1% side, all of these campuses,
3748100	3751700	who used to be the places where fuck society,
3751700	3754420	fuck your parents even, yeah, they paid for tuition,
3754420	3756740	but they paid tuition because, you know what,
3756740	3759180	this is a burgeoning industry, this idea of shaping
3759180	3761460	your young adult mind.
3761460	3763420	Your parents are going to pay $50,000,
3763420	3766140	and they're going to get a hippie spit out of this shoot,
3766140	3768460	and they're going to be like, what the fuck did I pay for?
3768460	3770460	And we're going to be like, a genius.
3770460	3772260	And there was leeway there.
3772260	3776740	But then from all sides, you've been telling me about this.
3776740	3779860	There was this shift in the 80s, 90s,
3779860	3783220	where it was basically, in general,
3783220	3787180	financial institutions started hanging out
3787180	3790780	at the bars where government hung out at,
3790780	3793620	and started going, hey, you want a pack of cigarettes?
3793620	3794900	Follow me to my van.
3794900	3799380	And then all government became slowly metastasized
3799380	3801620	this entire thing.
3801620	3807460	The separation of government and business just disappeared.
3807460	3809660	And now government has just taken it up the butt
3809660	3813820	not using that derogatorily because they're enjoying it.
3813820	3816540	And they have a right to do it.
3817500	3818780	We need new colloquialism.
3818780	3819860	Right, it turns out we need it.
3819860	3820660	Yeah, it's fine.
3820660	3823340	We need new ways of stating.
3823340	3825740	We need a new word for pussy, and we need to do it.
3825740	3826580	I've been thinking that.
3826580	3827900	You can't be David Mamet anymore.
3827900	3828940	You can't just say, you know what?
3828940	3832540	You're going to swallow my cum, you fucking faggot pussy.
3832540	3834020	You need all curse words.
3834020	3837980	You might have an important point about dynamics.
3837980	3840140	But yeah, so obviously.
3840140	3841860	I don't know if this was a nefarious plan,
3841860	3844260	but it certainly evolved this way.
3844260	3845700	And again, I think it's a lot because
3845700	3847460	of unintended consequences.
3847460	3852340	So give me an example of why, at least from my perspective,
3852340	3853740	a lot of these things changed.
3853740	3856220	In the early 1980s, US News and World Report
3856220	3859420	came out with a ranking of colleges.
3859420	3862980	And I would argue that that event actually
3862980	3866700	accelerated all of these previous inclinations
3866700	3868740	that the institutions had, but never really acted upon
3868740	3871260	because it was never really in their interest.
3871260	3873740	All of a sudden, they had their in their interest
3873780	3876820	to do stupid things like restrict the number of students
3876820	3879420	and come to the university because they wanted to have
3879420	3882020	low acceptance rates and then have a lot of professors
3882020	3883020	for every student.
3883020	3884260	But you didn't actually want the professor
3884260	3885380	to teach the students.
3885380	3886980	You want them to be in the lab doing research.
3886980	3889540	And then you want to spend as much money as possible
3889540	3892500	on that professor to do research so that you would go up
3892500	3893340	in the rankings.
3893340	3895220	And if you did that, guess what?
3895220	3897420	You need a lot of rich kids to support
3897420	3900260	this constricted number of seats.
3900260	3901860	And the reverse would be a party school.
3901980	3904180	You would show pictures of the football team.
3904180	3905780	You'd show pictures of great fans
3905780	3907740	and people spring breaking it up.
3907740	3909100	Exactly.
3909100	3910660	And what both of those have in common
3910660	3912580	and what all of that has in common with meanwhile
3912580	3915580	in the inner cities, kids being pushed through
3915580	3918900	that can pass tests, all of that goes back
3918900	3923900	to the hydra of capitalism, which isn't a bad thing unless,
3923980	3926140	but well, maybe it is a bad thing.
3926140	3930380	Well, it's bad because what happens in the outcome
3930380	3933460	is that if the school is kind of where it comes back,
3933460	3935260	the banks and everybody else,
3935260	3938340	those institutions want to hire ultimately
3938340	3942140	and wind up hiring the sons and daughters of rich people.
3942140	3947140	If you trusted the US dollar to measure everything,
3948180	3952220	if you trust it to give equivalence,
3952220	3953500	everything is going to have a price.
3953500	3954820	Human life is going to have a price.
3954820	3957540	Like we know this, it's right under our nose.
3957540	3961140	We know that medicine doesn't work privately.
3961140	3963540	We know that education is not working privately.
3963540	3964540	We know that like-
3964540	3968860	Well, but it can if you had people think systemically, right?
3968860	3970780	So if the government rather than saying,
3970780	3972740	we're just going to subsidize universities
3972740	3975060	and keep a blind eye.
3975060	3978900	If in 1965, when federal financial aid got implemented
3978900	3982300	and all they said would be any university
3982300	3984260	is also referred to financial aid,
3984260	3986700	if and only if the cost to attend that university
3986700	3989140	rise at the rate of inflation or lower.
3989140	3990180	If they just did that,
3990180	3992860	you know how much every university would cost now?
3992860	3995540	What we cost, what we cost intuition and fees.
3995540	3996460	I wasn't listening to that
3996460	3997620	because I was thinking about,
3997620	3999820	because I've been trying to bring up our second guest
3999820	4003500	because I want to plug this key master into this gatekeeper.
4003500	4004660	I don't know if you guys are going to fight
4004660	4007820	or blow up New York,
4007820	4010900	but let's bring up our old friend, Josh Androsky.
4010900	4022260	Oh, yeah, looking fresh.
4022260	4023500	Hi, hello.
4023500	4026060	So socialists are dressing differently now
4026060	4026900	since the last time we talked.
4026900	4030340	Yeah, I figured I wouldn't wear a flannel.
4030340	4033140	And I'm instead wearing a Shannon and the clam shirt
4033140	4034660	with two barks kissing.
4034660	4036540	That white jacket though is dope.
4036540	4037660	Thank you.
4037660	4038900	It's luxury socialist.
4038900	4041060	Have you been taking any of this stuff in, Josh?
4041060	4041900	Yes.
4043220	4048220	So I'm a little, I'm conflicted personally with my ideology.
4048300	4053260	I agree that I think schools should be public institutions.
4053260	4057580	I think that as a society, we should value education
4057580	4059940	and we should put people in our government
4059940	4062300	that value education and again,
4062300	4065380	the tendrils of capitalism have infected education,
4065380	4067740	healthcare, blah, blah, blah, all that shit.
4067740	4072740	But I am also very intrigued at you destroying Harvard.
4073420	4075100	Reforming, reforming, we want to reform.
4075100	4077180	I'm an accelerationist.
4077180	4079620	I think that Harvard is the ISIS of comedy.
4080500	4083420	And I think that they deserve to go down.
4083420	4084300	That is hilarious.
4084300	4085140	The best.
4085140	4085980	The ISIS of comedy.
4085980	4087460	Yes, I mean, just look at SNL.
4090940	4092780	For those who don't know, there's a huge rivalry
4092780	4095900	in the comedy community between Harvard and working guys.
4096060	4098780	They fucking actually tell jokes and love it.
4098780	4100300	Yeah, it's crazy.
4100300	4103140	But it's the exact thing where it's like,
4103140	4105380	you get into Harvard because you have the same last name
4105380	4107620	as someone who got into Harvard and then, oh my God,
4107620	4109020	look at you, you're writing on the show
4109020	4111300	that used to be good and is now bad.
4111300	4113620	It's so weird that there's more Harvard people.
4114580	4116780	The best Harvard alum is the Unabomber.
4116780	4117620	Anyway.
4119060	4121060	As a word for the other, I don't know,
4121060	4123260	as a showrunner who has therefore accidentally
4123260	4124660	hired Ivy League guys.
4126820	4127980	I'm looking back now.
4127980	4131260	Actually, since the election is in the room,
4131260	4133820	I used to mock all my Ivy League guys
4133820	4135020	because I have class issues.
4135020	4137980	Because I'm like, they teach you that at Harvard.
4137980	4138980	They teach you that.
4138980	4141340	But like, they don't teach them anything there.
4141340	4143620	There is some kind of co-relation.
4143620	4146020	It's probably not cause effect, but there's a co-relation.
4146020	4147700	Yeah, they keep the lights on.
4147700	4149420	I mean, you've got to have people who actually show up
4149420	4151980	to work, and that's the Harvard guys.
4152060	4154940	Comedy writing requires a support system.
4154940	4158140	So if you're from the streets and you
4158140	4163540	want to be a comedy writer, you're
4163540	4168340	at this huge disadvantage, which at the same time means that,
4168340	4171300	OK, so if you want the veal cutlets,
4171300	4173820	go with the people that had the support system.
4173820	4176980	Because if at 13, if you were Harvard bound
4176980	4179820	and you decided you wanted to be a Harvard writer,
4179820	4181500	you can then split that assembly line
4181500	4183140	into hacks and geniuses.
4183140	4186980	And so there are people that come out of the Ivy League
4186980	4189860	that knew that they wanted to quit there knowing,
4189860	4191780	I don't want to be a comedy writer,
4191780	4193780	and I've worked with these guys.
4193780	4197340	And yeah, it's like, it's whatever.
4197340	4200580	I didn't mean to piss on your fun parade and go like, well,
4200580	4201780	not everybody's everything.
4201780	4204540	Hashtag not all Harvards.
4204540	4205700	And it is a fun rivalry.
4205700	4206620	You're exactly right.
4206620	4207580	It's not a real rivalry.
4207580	4208100	No.
4208100	4210820	Because if it was, they would destroy us.
4210820	4213260	They're so rich.
4213260	4216340	If you could get a drone, it'd be over.
4216340	4217140	But yeah.
4217140	4218780	Shots rang out.
4218780	4221700	Why isn't education, so if we tomorrow,
4221700	4227580	if we created a utopian base on the moon and we said, OK,
4227580	4230740	nobody up here would privatize any aspect of education,
4230740	4231980	would we ever?
4231980	4233580	Well, what do you mean by privatize?
4233580	4235280	Well, I mean, charge money for it.
4235280	4236180	But I think I know how.
4236180	4237020	Absolutely.
4237060	4238060	Specialization.
4238060	4239260	I'll tell you why.
4239260	4243340	Nonprofit private universities are still private.
4243340	4244780	I mean, Berkeley is public.
4244780	4245860	Harvard is private.
4245860	4247700	Stanford is private.
4247700	4249060	SUNY is public.
4249060	4253540	Now, I'm actually opposed to the idea of free college.
4253540	4254820	And I'll tell you why.
4254820	4258620	Because it's a regressive policy.
4258620	4260740	Think about it.
4260740	4263980	So if you think about college, like, let's just say,
4263980	4266300	not higher education, but just college.
4266380	4268260	Like, Louis Louis is playing, and people
4268260	4269580	are chugging beers college.
4269580	4271380	Yes, that college, right?
4271380	4273420	Who goes to college?
4273420	4275180	Rich people.
4275180	4278620	So rich people and people who are eventually
4278620	4281940	going to be relatively wealthy.
4281940	4284180	Who is the tax base of this country?
4284180	4285660	100% of Americans.
4285660	4289380	One way, shape, or form, you pay in taxes
4289380	4290740	into this government.
4290740	4295660	And so if you say, I'm going to take 100% of people's money
4295660	4300380	and effectively give it to rich people who don't need it,
4300380	4303700	and people who will be rich, maybe some of them
4303700	4304620	do need a leg up.
4304620	4306460	But eventually, we'll be able to actually make that.
4306460	4308460	I think you're just starting the numbers crazy.
4308460	4311740	Like, there's way less rich people than poor people.
4311740	4313620	Or there's fewer rich people than there
4313620	4315780	are people that could use college for free.
4315780	4316620	Oh, yeah, for sure.
4316620	4320100	But the problem is that rich people are overwhelmingly
4320100	4322460	going to college, whereas poor people from abortion do not.
4322460	4323700	Because they can't afford it.
4323700	4326140	And if they could, then they would overwhelmingly go to college.
4326140	4328540	Even if they can't afford it, the problem goes much earlier.
4328540	4330500	Well, I think that's why I want to dis-
4330500	4335700	I simplified it by saying, if we were on the moon, if all we had
4335700	4342140	was some disaster, all we have is a couple cans of air
4342140	4343980	and some tents and some shit.
4343980	4345540	We got 100 people.
4345540	4349060	And we're designing a society now.
4349060	4353100	So we want to pick which parts of our society
4353100	4359220	are driven by the moon dollar, if anything is going to be,
4359220	4363300	if there is going to be a moon dollar, I should say.
4363300	4364580	That's what I meant.
4364580	4367540	If we're starting from scratch, because it sounds like more like,
4367540	4368700	you're being more pragmatic.
4368700	4369980	I'm going to burn from pragmatic.
4369980	4371820	You're saying, oh, if you change this light bulb
4371820	4375300	and plug in this Christmas ornament, I'm still going to burn.
4375300	4379180	I think ideologically, it's like, why would education ever
4379180	4380980	be purchasable?
4380980	4388460	Why would any child, whether they're
4388460	4391620	1 years old, 25 years old, 48 years old,
4391620	4398580	why would any student that wants to learn anything,
4398580	4402260	why does it benefit your society if the moon is
4402260	4404500	going to go to war with Mars and the moon
4404500	4408540	has decided to charge money for education and Mars hasn't?
4408540	4410620	I feel like Mars is going to win.
4411220	4412660	Now, we have a different problem here,
4412660	4414980	because we can also say, oh, legalize everything.
4414980	4418420	But if we legalize all drugs tomorrow here in our situation,
4418420	4420420	we're going to have blood on our hands.
4420420	4421820	Except what's illegal?
4421820	4424020	What drugs are illegal?
4424020	4426020	Well, I'm just saying there's a difference
4426020	4427520	between having these conversations
4427520	4430180	when there's an existing infrastructure.
4430180	4431420	How do we move?
4431420	4433220	There are no silver bullets.
4433220	4434660	Within the existing infrastructure,
4434660	4438820	I still think that you're being a little tricky with numbers
4438820	4440380	and with statistics, because you
4440380	4445780	say that poor people, regardless of how affordable college is,
4445780	4447980	wouldn't go.
4447980	4450740	No, no, I'm all for the why is it regressive?
4450740	4456060	It's regressive, because if you can afford $70,000 a year,
4456060	4459660	and somebody says, let that person go for free on the
4459660	4461620	taxpayer's dollar, that's insane.
4461620	4463220	I'm totally fine.
4463220	4464460	I think that's insane.
4464460	4467300	Giving the six rich people the money
4467300	4470780	if the 94 out of the 100 also hit it.
4470780	4472300	We don't know what social class is
4472300	4474860	going to yield the doctor that produces the cure for cancer.
4474860	4476780	But they're going to college anyway.
4476780	4478980	No, they don't need.
4478980	4480500	A bunch of them are going to jail.
4480500	4485900	No, the kids that can afford it, mommy and daddy
4485900	4487220	are writing that check.
4487220	4488820	Right, but the kids who can't afford it
4488820	4491500	might be the ones to cure the disease that we don't even
4491500	4492660	know we're going to get yet.
4492660	4494700	So we need to focus on them.
4494700	4498020	But why would you not means test access to college?
4498020	4498980	It doesn't make any sense.
4498980	4500460	If you have the means test.
4500460	4504020	Means test is interesting, but denying access
4504020	4505500	will never yield the result.
4505500	4506020	No, no, no.
4506020	4506740	That's all I'm saying.
4506740	4509300	The opposite is what got us into this problem
4509300	4511140	in the first place, where if you look
4511140	4514340	throughout the history of America, sweeping programs.
4514340	4517940	For example, you look at the golden age of comedy, right?
4517940	4521180	The golden age of comedy, you had all these public works,
4521180	4523700	theaters, and places where people could do music.
4523740	4526940	And all of these things were funded by a class
4526940	4528580	traitor in the White House, right?
4528580	4531820	And so without that, these broke Jew immigrants
4531820	4535620	that I come from wouldn't be able to go learn
4535620	4538140	to play the trombone and then become Sid Caesar.
4538140	4541420	And so if it was means tested, it would be like,
4541420	4545300	if you make $14,999, you get to go to college.
4545300	4548300	If you make $15,001, you don't get to go to college.
4548300	4550180	Well, it's just a badly designed program, right?
4550180	4553580	I mean, but I think it goes beyond that, where the idea.
4554100	4555220	And for those that don't understand,
4555220	4558860	the idea of means testing is to put a sort of line
4558860	4561620	in the sand, where you go, if you're more poor than this,
4561620	4563900	you get this, if you're not, you don't.
4563900	4568220	And certainly, there will be absolutely people
4568220	4570820	that are rich or who don't need the program
4570820	4572820	who will benefit from it.
4572820	4576660	But if you look, I mean, realistically, at the numbers,
4576660	4579020	there's far more people who deserve something
4579020	4579860	that will be getting it.
4579860	4581620	That's why I believe that healthcare
4581620	4586460	should be totally free and public and public universities.
4586460	4588660	And I actually do think that there is a place
4588660	4591460	for private universities, for-profit private universities
4591460	4593660	within the system, optionally.
4593660	4596580	Because I don't believe in like a Stalin thing.
4596580	4599860	To me, educational, I guess, privatization
4599860	4603540	would be analogous with elective surgery.
4603540	4606340	I want to look like Mel Brooks.
4606340	4607540	But then don't you keep forgetting the advantage?
4607540	4609060	Then, okay, then you have to pay for that.
4609060	4609900	The government doesn't pay for that.
4609900	4611100	But that's not good.
4611100	4613660	That's not good, because then, all of the rich people,
4613660	4615060	this is what you have today.
4615060	4618500	You have the poor people going to the poor university.
4618500	4620420	And you have the rich people going to the rich university.
4620420	4622340	Where's Goldman Sachs going to go higher?
4622340	4624860	I mean, hopefully, nowhere near my friends.
4624860	4626420	Okay, well, the point is, is that.
4626420	4627860	When it comes to sciences, though,
4627860	4630140	it doesn't matter which university you go to.
4630140	4631620	It's the results that you yield.
4631620	4633100	It's the skills that you learn.
4633100	4633980	Correct, right?
4633980	4634820	So, again.
4634820	4636300	But then you have to resource those universities
4636300	4637980	to provide those results, right?
4637980	4638900	But that's what happens.
4638940	4641180	Rich companies come in and they buy half of University
4641180	4644340	of Wisconsin to develop something for their company.
4644340	4647700	But when you limit access, you guarantee
4647700	4648900	that you are not going to get the best part of it.
4648900	4649780	Oh, no, exactly.
4649780	4651860	So, what you have to do is you have to change.
4651860	4653100	So, again, this is a good way.
4653100	4655820	So, I'll give you a solution that I would implement
4655820	4657700	if I were like Magic Wand, right?
4657700	4661380	So, Magic Wand would be the government's declaration,
4661380	4663980	which is, if you want to be a nonprofit,
4663980	4667980	if you want to have any federal dollars, any kind,
4667980	4671100	access to all grants, not pay taxes, and all the rest,
4671100	4675500	very simply, your student body needs to roughly align
4675500	4677860	to the socioeconomic spectrum in the United States.
4677860	4678700	Right?
4678700	4679860	Pay deciles, right?
4679860	4682060	You get 10% of your students from the top 10%,
4682060	4683820	10% of the bottom 10%, and throughout.
4683820	4688220	If you do not do that, all of your federal funding, gone.
4688220	4689060	Deal.
4689060	4689900	Right?
4689900	4692420	At that point, you have solved the access problem overnight.
4692420	4693260	Yeah.
4693260	4695100	I mean, or you don't have to do anything for free, right?
4695100	4696780	You just have to actually get those units.
4696780	4698900	So, Harvard won't be 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.
4698900	4701300	It would be 10% and 90% from the bottom.
4701300	4703540	It would take no chances.
4703540	4704380	Right?
4704380	4706340	So, this to me is something that you could do.
4706340	4709140	I feel like that system sounds better for Congress,
4709140	4712860	if Congress had to have a representative
4712860	4715300	spectrum of wealth as America.
4715300	4718260	But for like, if we talk about how you need a college
4718260	4721260	education for a job, if we talk about how,
4721260	4722980	for me personally, and for a lot of people,
4722980	4725100	I think education is a human right,
4725100	4730100	then anything that you do to get rid of access,
4730500	4735100	to limit access to all people is bad.
4735100	4737660	And that's not to say that like,
4737660	4740700	if you go to the poor school or whatever,
4740700	4743020	it would be in a situation where,
4743020	4745380	because of the taxes, because of the money coming in,
4745380	4747380	there would be all this new money coming into
4747380	4748980	public universities.
4748980	4751180	So, those schools would become better, right?
4751180	4753540	If there's more people, if there's more perspectives,
4753620	4755100	if there's more money coming in,
4755100	4757260	then people who go to those schools,
4757260	4760740	who luck out and become people who can hire people,
4760740	4763340	they will go, I'm not gonna hire from Harvard.
4763340	4764980	This hypothetical is just as realistic as your hypothetical.
4764980	4765980	Correct, it's correct.
4765980	4770940	If you actually create a much, much more well-resourced,
4770940	4772940	education-focused public university
4772940	4775060	that actually teaches people how to think,
4775060	4776300	and you have the privacy keeping doing
4776300	4779100	whatever they're doing, then you're definitely right.
4779100	4779940	Yeah, I think-
4779940	4781940	Then the tide will shift.
4781940	4783060	I think with my drunken brain,
4783060	4785660	I think I'm just dumb enough to perceive
4785660	4787300	the two smart people are agreeing,
4787300	4791180	but that you guys are different distances from the problem.
4791180	4792020	Yeah.
4792020	4794100	Not distances from the problem being a-
4794100	4794940	Approaching.
4794940	4799660	Like, you were born from it and have a fuckin',
4799660	4803820	like, you wanna dig in and plug this wire into that wire
4803820	4807060	and hotwire this car, and Josh is going,
4807060	4808420	why fuckin' cars, man?
4808420	4810260	Like, that's why.
4810380	4813180	And I think both of you are agreeing,
4813180	4816780	but or I'm dumb and drunk, and that's at least half true.
4816780	4820100	I think absolutely that your system has a place
4820100	4822180	within the system that I'm imagining.
4822180	4827180	I think that there absolutely, it's absurd that
4827980	4831740	the IVs run the way they do with legacy bullshit
4831740	4834820	and all of that, and that absolutely needs to be reformed,
4834820	4837780	and that there absolutely is a place in the world
4837780	4840460	for those who choose, electively,
4840460	4845460	to join a for-profit, specialized, private institution.
4845940	4848780	Like DeVryne, or ITT.
4848780	4849620	Yeah.
4849620	4850980	Or several places you could go to.
4850980	4852780	We will leave links.
4852780	4854820	Yeah, if you use the promo code, whoops,
4854820	4857060	you can join University of Phoenix right now.
4857060	4860500	Well, if I don't play the bad guy and cut people off,
4860500	4864940	then no one is, and that's my role,
4865180	4868340	because as you know, if you're new to this podcast,
4868340	4869940	it's time to play BaldrDash.
4869940	4874940	Uh, so Spencer, are you prepared to,
4877940	4881140	you're not DMing BaldrDash because the part of the game
4881140	4884540	is that we're gonna rotate through dealers, I think.
4884540	4885940	Yeah, I think that's part of the game.
4885940	4888100	The game of BaldrDash is simple.
4888100	4889620	You guys played BaldrDash?
4889620	4890940	No.
4890940	4894500	Each participant will make up an answer
4895980	4897580	to the question, right?
4897580	4899060	Well, you explain it, you're better.
4899060	4900340	I'm bad at explaining games.
4900340	4903900	Well, let me, why don't I dash for the first round?
4903900	4904740	All right.
4904740	4906820	And then, and then I think that, I think it'll,
4906820	4909740	I think by playing a round, it'll become.
4909740	4910660	Learn by doing.
4910660	4912740	Yeah, it's pretty simple.
4912740	4915700	It's basically like, I'm gonna give you guys
4915700	4917620	a piece of paper, I'm gonna give you,
4917660	4918860	I'm gonna give you a.
4920780	4921620	A box.
4922820	4924340	I'm gonna give you a box.
4924340	4926660	I'm gonna give you, depending on the category,
4926660	4930300	I'm gonna give you an acronym, a movie title,
4930300	4933060	a human name, something like that.
4933060	4937100	That thing has a sort of explanation.
4937100	4939140	If it's a movie, the movie has a synopsis.
4939140	4943780	If it's an acronym, then the letters I'm gonna give you
4943780	4946580	stand for something in real life somewhere.
4946620	4948300	I'm gonna know the answer to that.
4948300	4950100	You guys are gonna take two minutes.
4950100	4951380	I've got a special surprise for you
4951380	4952580	during that two minutes.
4954100	4959100	To write an attempt at a convincing answer
4959180	4960680	to what that thing is.
4962100	4964220	And then I'm gonna read them all aloud,
4964220	4967420	including the real answer.
4967420	4968260	And.
4970260	4971100	Cards?
4971100	4972580	Yes.
4972580	4974060	And then here's your answer card.
4974060	4976080	I'll explain more in a second.
4977500	4979700	Spencer, you're gonna do one too, right?
4979700	4980540	Yeah.
4980540	4985140	Okay, so players, so these are for far away.
4985140	4987620	So he's gonna read the name,
4987620	4990180	and then we're gonna invent.
4990180	4991020	Yeah.
4991020	4992500	Fake answers.
4992500	4995040	All right, so I'm going to,
4996100	4998380	I'm gonna start with a really simple example
4998380	5002720	because I think one of my least favorite categories
5002720	5005060	will actually make the best practice round.
5005060	5006740	It's called laughable laws.
5007740	5008580	Okay.
5008580	5009900	Laffable laws.
5009900	5011900	All right, so if I say to you guys,
5011900	5014580	in Garfield County, Montana,
5014580	5018460	it is illegal to draw dot, dot, dot.
5018460	5022000	And then you just have two minutes
5022000	5023560	to write an answer to that.
5023560	5028560	Please remember to write your name down in the lower right.
5028820	5031740	And your, yeah, and just write your answer
5031740	5032920	in the other spot.
5032920	5034460	And then for this two minutes,
5034460	5035920	Andy Dick is just gonna,
5037260	5039020	we're gonna have two minutes of Andy Dick.
5039020	5039860	While you,
5039860	5040700	Andy Dick, we have a microphone for you.
5040700	5041540	If you need it.
5041540	5043280	Yes, it's over there, sorry.
5043280	5045060	Okay, is anyone keeping time though?
5045060	5046460	I forgot that part.
5046460	5048460	It's on, but talk into it together.
5048460	5049880	You can't, hello?
5049880	5050780	Oh yeah, okay.
5050780	5051620	Okay.
5051620	5053340	Can I get my new intern up to hold this?
5053340	5055660	They don't have a stand.
5055660	5056500	Do a genie.
5056500	5058260	We must be 35 seconds into it.
5058260	5059100	Well, that's okay.
5059100	5059920	They're already writing the hand.
5059920	5060760	If they have longer, it's just,
5060760	5061580	you come up.
5066380	5067220	You're done already?
5067220	5069300	I didn't even do my thing.
5069300	5070140	You keep going.
5070140	5070980	You keep going.
5070980	5071800	I'll do it on the next one.
5071800	5073060	We got two whole minutes.
5074460	5075300	Just have to.
5075300	5076140	What minute are we on?
5076140	5078460	We're on like 30 minutes, 30 seconds.
5078460	5080100	Are you doing whippets?
5080100	5080940	No.
5080940	5081780	Oh, I wish.
5081780	5083180	Yeah, me too.
5083180	5085020	Maybe if you blow in this and I suck.
5085020	5086820	We have some Andy Dick music, just,
5086820	5087660	is that where we're at?
5087660	5089100	Do the D and D music.
5089100	5089940	I got you.
5092940	5095280	Just, well, why don't you hold on to him and the,
5095280	5096120	or no, no, I'm just sorry.
5096120	5097120	I'm not talking to you, Andy.
5097120	5097960	Sorry.
5097960	5100440	I thought you were saying hold on to him, meaning me.
5100440	5102640	Cause I got to write the, you keep going.
5103720	5104540	Ow!
5104540	5105380	Damn you.
5107720	5108720	Thank you, Zach.
5112240	5115680	Oh, for the podcast, Andy's blowing up a glove.
5115680	5116520	I couldn't find the Michael Williams.
5116520	5117360	Oh, that's right.
5117360	5118200	Okay, Andy is blowing up a glove.
5118280	5119300	Yeah, thank you, Spencer.
5119300	5122140	No, I mean, that about covers it.
5122140	5123260	You guys done?
5123260	5124660	No, keep it, keep going.
5124660	5126020	We got about a minute.
5127740	5129700	Okay, you can hand me your cards.
5129700	5131100	I'm getting my head in.
5132540	5134340	I think I haven't made this work out.
5139620	5141580	You can put your name, you gotta.
5141580	5142420	Oh, okay.
5144060	5146020	Somebody else is making that.
5149180	5152580	We have a live ADR team here that is amazing.
5152580	5154140	I don't know which one is yours.
5154140	5155500	We could do it after, right?
5155500	5157820	Well, no, I don't know cause I don't.
5157820	5158660	Okay.
5158660	5160940	Oh, I got, I got, yeah, you, okay.
5160940	5161780	I know which one is yours
5161780	5163260	cause it's the one without the name on it.
5163260	5164100	Okay.
5165540	5167500	It was me doing it, wasn't it?
5167500	5168460	I don't think, I don't,
5168460	5171460	it sounded like it was coming from over there, didn't it?
5171460	5172300	I do.
5172300	5173300	Let me look at your answer.
5175040	5176660	Okay, all right.
5176660	5178140	This is going, this is going pretty good.
5178960	5180080	I think, all right.
5180080	5181160	No, wait, wait.
5183000	5184880	Okay, that's the two minute.
5184880	5185720	All right, thank you, Andy.
5185720	5187360	Dick, he'll be back in a moment.
5188560	5190200	All right, it'll be good.
5190200	5191680	We're all learning.
5191680	5194000	That's, that's, thank you, thank you.
5194000	5195960	Okay, I get it, I'm, okay.
5195960	5197360	Okay.
5197360	5199000	Those nitrile gloves are harder.
5199000	5200560	Let's strike that, can we strike that?
5200560	5201560	Can we strike that?
5201560	5202400	All right, good.
5202400	5203240	Let's strike that.
5203240	5204680	Can you point it right into the monitor?
5204680	5206040	Longest strike ever.
5206040	5207360	That was still on camera.
5207420	5209180	Human timer, Andy Dick.
5209180	5210020	Strike him.
5211700	5213220	As we go, okay.
5213220	5214820	This is a growth opportunity.
5214820	5216740	I'm worried about, I had a lot,
5216740	5217800	I had so much trouble with that
5217800	5219460	and I'm like the Balderdash expert.
5219460	5221180	I'm worried about sticking that on other people.
5221180	5223020	Like I'm, I think maybe I should just be
5223020	5223860	the permanent Balderdash dealer.
5223860	5225980	Yeah, I was kind of thinking about just having one dealer
5225980	5227300	when we were, yeah.
5227300	5228900	I'm pretty sure we all learned that tonight
5228900	5231020	no one can get an F.
5231020	5232180	Right.
5232180	5237020	All right, so, now, you at home and you guys,
5237040	5241780	it's your job to try to guess which one is the real one.
5241780	5246180	And then each person that guests the real one, if any,
5246180	5249240	those people get a certain number of points.
5249240	5251440	It's either one or two, I think it's one.
5252720	5257720	Anybody whose answer accrues guesses,
5258440	5260360	I think that guy gets two points.
5260360	5262160	See, this is means testing in action.
5265000	5266360	I got the points here.
5267260	5269540	If you get a vote, if you get your answer voted for,
5269540	5270380	you get a point.
5270380	5272340	If you get the right, if you guessed the right answer,
5272340	5273180	you get two points.
5273180	5274020	Okay, you get two points.
5274020	5276820	And if I, I get three points if none of you
5276820	5278800	guessed the real one, just as a.
5278800	5281740	Right, and if someone accidentally gets a right,
5281740	5282580	you also get three points.
5282580	5286420	All right, so, in Garfield County, Montana,
5286420	5288280	it is illegal to draw,
5292380	5293220	shuffling these up.
5293220	5294900	I wrote the real answer in one of these pieces of paper
5294900	5296020	so you're not getting any clues.
5296020	5298120	Are we allowed to use Google?
5298120	5298960	No.
5300800	5303160	It's not called bolder cheat.
5303160	5305560	Well, it wouldn't be cheating if you were allowed to use it.
5305560	5307000	In Garfield County, Montana,
5307000	5310160	it is illegal to draw funny faces
5310160	5313000	on the outside of your window shades.
5313000	5314240	Interesting.
5316000	5317140	This isn't Montana?
5318320	5319160	Yep.
5321160	5324280	A male phallus on an overpass.
5324280	5325860	Also, interesting.
5327020	5330820	A man enjoying himself to the Isley Brothers Live album
5330820	5332540	moments after his divorce.
5337060	5337980	Sharon.
5337980	5339680	Is final Sharon?
5342700	5345500	You're not supposed to tip your hat if you didn't answer.
5345500	5346420	To those listening.
5346420	5347860	I mean, you can, it's fun.
5347860	5348900	He is nodding.
5349780	5351300	Yeah, that didn't work out.
5351300	5352140	I wasn't gonna vote for that one.
5352140	5353620	I didn't know how this was gonna pay off.
5353620	5355120	No, it's cool.
5355120	5356720	You made the right choice.
5358120	5363120	A commissioned mural on a Monday, bitch.
5365760	5368320	Okay, so those answers again.
5368320	5369800	In Garfield County, Montana,
5369800	5372160	it is illegal to draw funny faces
5372160	5374400	on the outside of your window shades.
5374400	5376920	A male phallus on an overpass.
5376920	5379480	A man enjoying himself to the Isley Brothers Live album
5379480	5382440	moments after his divorce is final Sharon.
5383020	5383860	Okay.
5385040	5386440	Sorry.
5386440	5388680	That's a crime in a lot of states, Sharon.
5390060	5394420	A commissioned mural on a Monday, bitch.
5395720	5398420	All right, whose guesses are whom's?
5398420	5399920	Wait, are we supposed to guess?
5399920	5402360	Yes, that's why I said whose guesses are whom's.
5402360	5403820	The funny faces is my guess.
5403820	5405560	Funny faces is your guess.
5405560	5409480	So let's see, I'll put a little S there.
5409480	5411840	And then Ben, what's your guess?
5411860	5413460	I'm gonna go with the overpass.
5413460	5418460	Overpass phallus, so I'll put a BN there.
5418940	5420500	And then Josh.
5420500	5421940	I'm gonna go funny faces.
5421940	5423460	It's Montana, it's weird.
5423460	5427820	Funny faces, okay, so in the game of Balderdash,
5427820	5428900	what would happen here?
5428900	5430540	Wait, oh, wait, I'm sorry, Brandon, wait.
5430540	5431740	You didn't have to ask me.
5431740	5432940	Well, yeah, I mean.
5432940	5436460	No, no, what's your guess?
5436460	5439020	Josh, Josh, Josh, you're picking funny faces, right?
5439020	5440220	Josh, okay.
5440220	5441700	What do you think the real answer is?
5441960	5443640	Brandon, what do you think is the real one?
5443640	5445120	I was gonna say penises.
5446000	5451000	On the overpass, okay, so that's, okay.
5451000	5453000	So I don't get any points
5453000	5454920	because some of you guessed the real one.
5454920	5456560	The real one is funny faces
5456560	5458880	on the outside of the window sheds.
5458880	5460920	Spencer, therefore, gets a point.
5460920	5462920	I get two points for getting the right answer,
5462920	5466160	and I get two points because two people voted for my answer.
5466160	5469160	Wait, oh, no, you get one point for guessing
5469160	5470000	the right answer.
5470020	5472580	I get two points who guessed the real answer.
5472580	5475180	Two points to players who guessed the real answer.
5477980	5479620	I'm reading it right off the thing.
5479620	5480780	Two points to players who guessed the right answer.
5480780	5482540	So you get a point for everyone who guesses yours.
5482540	5484060	So two people guessed yours.
5484060	5485660	So you're getting a total of three points.
5485660	5488440	Because I did the fallacies on the overpass.
5488440	5489280	Oh, oh.
5495140	5498140	Spencer just left, ran off stage.
5498140	5498980	He's lost his mind.
5499040	5501520	He's back on stage, rolled on stage.
5501520	5504000	Fire rolled on stage, and he's back to the chair,
5504000	5506000	which did not roll away.
5506000	5506840	He stuck the landing.
5506840	5508160	I hope I win now.
5508160	5512360	So that's a total of, yeah, I can't remember.
5512360	5513200	Four points.
5513200	5514360	Okay.
5514360	5516120	Did anyone else win points?
5516120	5518720	Yeah, some other people won some points because...
5518720	5522120	Yeah, you got two points for getting the right answer.
5522120	5523200	Right?
5523200	5524680	God damn it.
5524680	5525520	It's too hard.
5525520	5526340	Points are fun.
5526360	5529240	You could just do the rounds without keeping score.
5529240	5531400	Well, yeah, but that's not fun, right?
5531400	5532600	I mean, it's all relative.
5532600	5534000	Well, it's funner than this.
5537000	5538920	We could eat bowls of shit and be funny.
5538920	5540160	That's not, wait a minute.
5540160	5541880	I'm a fun stickler.
5545880	5547400	Wait, wake up, Harmon.
5547400	5549880	I don't know how Doug Benson does on his show.
5549880	5551040	Yeah, I guess I was just thinking
5551040	5552760	if we did enough rounds.
5552760	5554280	But then I was, it's just like,
5554340	5557260	I wouldn't wish this job on anyone.
5557260	5558300	This is awful.
5558300	5559500	It's really hard to do.
5559500	5561900	Yeah, this job is Balderdash.
5561900	5564060	Oh, that's why it's the dasher.
5564060	5565220	I just got that.
5565220	5568820	All right, so Spencer won and somebody else got points.
5568820	5572340	So I should have ran around my answer.
5572340	5574820	We could do another round.
5574820	5577100	I mean, you don't seem to want to, so that's fine.
5577100	5580260	I'm just worried about, I have two hats on.
5580260	5582340	One is a terrible Balderdash dealer,
5582400	5584440	and then the other is a terrible podcast host.
5584440	5586440	Yeah.
5586440	5589600	I feel like I'm making my, the two of them
5589600	5592560	are losing to each other.
5592560	5595800	And yeah, and we're all losing to Doug Benson.
5595800	5598560	It feels like choosing a holiday game that ends in arguments
5598560	5601280	might not have been the best.
5601280	5603320	But talking about politics was going so well.
5603320	5608440	I think you bet you could fix it all.
5608440	5611020	Can we give you, we stall just a little bit,
5611040	5614800	maybe ask Ben where we're going in terms of education.
5614800	5619120	You mean while Andy Dick does two minutes, or do you mean?
5619120	5620760	While you get your cards together,
5620760	5622660	because we don't know what that, what's
5622660	5625440	the uptick on the way of getting out of this conversation
5625440	5627940	that we had with you earlier that's sort of like,
5627940	5628680	what should we expect?
5632440	5636640	Yeah, that ain't nearly as good, Andy Dick.
5636640	5637480	Is there a camera?
5637480	5638800	I thought I heard my name.
5638800	5640680	No, you did.
5641140	5642460	I mean, am I early or late?
5642460	5644540	You're just a little early, you're just a little early.
5644540	5645800	But you had all the instruments.
5645800	5647340	You did have the right instruments.
5650580	5652860	I could have sworn we said two hangers, Andy Dick.
5652860	5656300	One hanger, Andy Dick is who we're working with right now.
5656300	5657540	Jesus.
5657540	5660060	OK, yeah, tell us, tell us, tell us, tell us.
5660060	5661780	Give us a little future.
5661780	5664260	So give you an example.
5664260	5666860	So whenever it was now on our third class of undergrads,
5666860	5668460	so it started this past September.
5668460	5671320	And where are the first one and two classes?
5671320	5672880	This semester, they're in Seoul.
5672880	5674480	Next semester, they're going to Hyderabad.
5674480	5676080	Awesome.
5676080	5681320	And for this third class, we received more applications,
5681320	5684040	third class ever, than Dartmouth or MIT did.
5684040	5685680	So give me, what's the ballpark on that?
5685680	5688600	20,400 applications from 179 countries.
5688600	5690680	And how many people are you going to take?
5690680	5695240	We took last year just under 2%, which actually shows
5695240	5697640	that you can be the most selective university
5697700	5700460	in the country and the most economically diverse
5700460	5703100	without trying.
5703100	5703980	That wasn't the goal.
5703980	5705860	It was just we stopped discriminating.
5705860	5707460	Do you have scholarships?
5707460	5709940	Yeah, 80% of our students are in some form or financial.
5709940	5711340	That's pretty amazing.
5711340	5712500	It's pretty amazing.
5712500	5713820	So what do you hope?
5713820	5716260	What is your biggest dream with all of this?
5716260	5718220	Would you want a brick and mortar one day?
5718220	5719420	No, no.
5719420	5722660	My biggest dream is that other universities
5722660	5724260	are forced to follow.
5724260	5727020	Because what we've shown, third party
5727120	5729640	assessed our students and showed that what our students
5729640	5732200	have been able to accomplish in eight months,
5732200	5734000	no university has been able to demonstrate
5734000	5736640	that they can get their students to accomplish in four years.
5736640	5740000	And that's on critical thinking, problem solving, reasoning,
5740000	5741200	and communication skills.
5741200	5744040	Do you have any sort of endowment program?
5744040	5751040	We have endowment, but it will take a long time to realize.
5751120	5753440	So right now, we're doing a lot of fundraising
5753440	5756360	to enable all those scholarships.
5756360	5759140	And it's hard work.
5759140	5760620	Yeah, thanks for doing that.
5760620	5763740	Well, that sounds like Andy Dick.
5763740	5764860	Where are you?
5764860	5766180	No, no, no, no, no.
5766180	5767300	Wait, hold on to Andy Dick.
5767300	5768940	Hold on, Andy Dick.
5768940	5769820	Hold your Andy Dick.
5769820	5772380	Stroke it, but hold it.
5772380	5773020	Love it.
5773020	5774060	It's our fault.
5774060	5777140	It sounds a lot to me like the narrative is subjective,
5777140	5783620	as it is in the category of picking marvelous movies
5783620	5784860	in Balderdash.
5784880	5789680	I'd like you to each take one of these empty Balderdash cards.
5789680	5795560	And I'd like you to try to convince each other what
5795560	5801160	the plot synopsis would be for a marvelous movie entitled
5801160	5805240	San Diego, I Love You.
5805240	5808800	Two minutes of Andy Dick will happen during your writing.
5808800	5809300	Yeah.
5814920	5816660	Yeah, I saw this in Germany once.
5816660	5817320	It was amazing.
5828120	5829320	Yeah.
5829320	5830560	Oh, don't hurt yourself.
5830560	5832720	Well, we'll get somebody to help you next time.
5832720	5833220	Sorry.
5839560	5840840	When does the time start?
5840840	5842120	It started, yeah.
5842120	5843520	Tell me when we're at 30.
5843520	5844040	You got it.
5844040	5846820	We're ramping up, and then tell me we're at 1-3.
5846820	5849060	I got it.
5849060	5849620	We're at 30.
5849620	5850660	No, I'll do that.
5850660	5851700	He needs to write an answer.
5851700	5853180	OK.
5853180	5854340	We're at 30.
5854340	5854980	No, no, no.
5859380	5863980	Two hanger, two hanger, two hanger, Andy Dick in the house.
5863980	5867860	Two hanger, two hanger, two hanger, Andy Dick in the house.
5867860	5869020	Brandon, write your answer.
5875040	5876620	I'm hitting the bridge.
5876620	5880100	This should be about the bridge, like the midpoint.
5880100	5880600	Oh.
5890000	5891400	I'm doing kind of blacky there.
5891400	5891900	Yeah.
5891900	5893480	Well, I don't at least look up.
5893480	5893980	Well, don't.
5893980	5894600	He's writing.
5894600	5895100	Don't get.
5899180	5902380	He's in the competition, and you're looking at him
5902380	5903420	and banging a thing.
5904320	5905720	I can talk to you about it.
5905720	5908320	I told you you had to read these guys.
5908320	5911080	They're all writing, yeah.
5911080	5912440	I'll interview you.
5912440	5914400	Now, Andy, I don't want to get you legal trouble,
5914400	5916000	but this is stomp-based, maybe?
5916000	5916880	This is stomp-based?
5919480	5921520	You know stomp is sponsored by Excedrin.
5925800	5926640	Is that a setup?
5926640	5928520	Am I supposed to?
5928520	5933320	Well, how did they know?
5933320	5935660	Oh, it was sponsored by Excedrin.
5935660	5936260	OK, all right.
5936260	5937740	That was my timer.
5937740	5938860	That's been two minutes?
5938860	5940580	Yeah.
5940580	5942660	Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Dick, thank you so much.
5942660	5945820	Andy Dick goes two minutes of me, Andy Dick.
5945820	5947580	Andy Dick, this is not his first time.
5947580	5948180	Andy Dick.
5948180	5949620	Go take those.
5949620	5951700	We could do that.
5951700	5954780	Do I have everybody's card over here?
5954780	5956620	I got people forgetting to write their names.
5956620	5958180	That's a normal Balderdash thing.
5958440	5961320	Gotcha.
5961320	5965960	OK, I think if I can.
5965960	5967040	And that's OK.
5967040	5970760	And so I know the person that didn't write their name then.
5970760	5973680	OK.
5973680	5975040	Why are you so mean to me?
5975040	5976080	I don't think you wrote your name.
5976080	5976600	Oh, you did.
5976600	5977640	Bottom right, bottom right.
5977640	5978640	Yeah, wait, who didn't?
5981720	5983000	No, thank you, though.
5983000	5983680	God bless.
5986640	5987640	Oh, boy.
5988460	5990500	No, no, that wasn't it.
5990500	5992260	I know how that sounded hearing it.
5992260	5995380	But it was just like, yeah, this is.
5995380	6000860	Yeah, I mean, look, obviously, it's not going to take out D&D.
6000860	6001660	So you're safe.
6001660	6003700	No, this isn't what I'm saying.
6003700	6008500	It's just like, this has been a, I mean, gauntlet is negative.
6008500	6012500	But smorgasbord, to be sure.
6012500	6015540	Just keep on your toes, you know, if D&D ever falls
6015540	6018080	below this level of entertainment.
6018080	6019240	I'm not complaining.
6019240	6020840	I like this.
6020840	6023840	I like bad podcast.
6023840	6025560	No, no, I really do.
6025560	6026720	I think this is a lot of fun.
6026720	6028720	I finally figured out it's Brandon didn't write his name.
6028720	6029440	It's very unique.
6029440	6032040	I feel like the listeners should be doing what they do right now.
6032040	6032440	OK.
6032440	6034640	They should be entertaining themselves for a second.
6034640	6035240	Yes.
6035240	6036240	You know, listeners.
6036240	6039800	If you're bored right now, it's because you as a listener have not.
6039800	6041640	You didn't get up to make a cheese sandwich?
6041640	6043800	You've been sitting here for hours and 46 minutes.
6043800	6046180	The old days, they were commercials.
6046180	6046680	Yeah.
6046680	6047180	Yeah.
6047180	6047760	All right.
6047760	6048780	Are you back from the bathroom?
6048780	6051180	Good, because we're ready for you now, listener.
6051180	6054540	Thanks for doing your part.
6054540	6055020	All right.
6055020	6058500	San Diego I Love You is a movie.
6058500	6063900	And the following possible synopses include the real one.
6063900	6065280	And your job is to guess.
6065280	6065780	OK.
6065780	6068220	Ooh, got a little shit fanged.
6068220	6070580	No, that was exactly the explanation of the game.
6070580	6071760	San Diego I Love You.
6071760	6077040	A daughter tries to keep her family together
6077040	6080220	while promoting her father's inventions.
6080220	6081100	I mean, man.
6081100	6082860	Try not to laugh.
6082860	6084420	San Diego I Love You.
6088420	6091340	San Diego is taken over by Oceanside Gamers.
6095300	6097980	San Diego I Love You.
6097980	6101240	It's just the godfather, but everyone's name is Skyler.
6105080	6106720	Everybody's name is what?
6106720	6107520	Skype?
6107520	6109200	Skyler.
6109200	6110560	San Diego I Love You.
6110560	6115640	Two paths collide in this 1980s culture crash
6115640	6120680	between a hip comic book artist and a fastidious marine drill
6120680	6121180	sergeant.
6123760	6126040	Interesting.
6126040	6131180	A romantic comedy musical about former high school
6131180	6133820	sweethearts who fall in love with each other
6133820	6136780	and their hometown.
6136780	6138420	So those synopses again.
6138420	6142020	Are their names San and Diego in the last one?
6142020	6143460	It could be any of those.
6143460	6144520	San Diego I Love You.
6144520	6147460	A daughter tries to keep her family together
6147460	6150140	while promoting her father's inventions.
6150140	6151220	San Diego I Love You.
6151220	6154100	San Diego is taken over by Oceanside Gamers.
6154100	6155740	San Diego I Love You.
6156440	6160080	It's just the godfather, but everyone's name is Skyler.
6160080	6161320	San Diego I Love You.
6161320	6164880	Two paths collide in this 1980s culture
6164880	6169060	crash between a hip comic book artist and a fastidious marine
6169060	6170440	drill sergeant.
6170440	6171720	San Diego I Love You.
6171720	6175680	A romantic comedy musical about former high school
6175680	6177760	sweethearts who fall in love with each other
6177760	6180520	and their hometown.
6180520	6183400	Oh, OK.
6183400	6184440	OK.
6184460	6188060	We'll start the guessing with Ben Nelson,
6188060	6191100	noted educational activist.
6191100	6193100	Turned Balderdash.
6193100	6197260	Balderdash, a very, very bad player.
6197260	6204700	I'll go with the culture crash, the 1980s culture crash.
6204700	6205820	Culture clash.
6205820	6208620	It's a class crash.
6208620	6210780	All right, we've got a BN on that one.
6210780	6213060	Shout out to culture clash.
6213060	6213580	All right.
6213600	6214480	Wonderful comedy show.
6214480	6216400	And Josh Andraske.
6220240	6222160	I'm a guy.
6222160	6226480	Social activist in self-imposed exile.
6226480	6226960	Sure.
6229800	6231400	I'm going to go with the culture clash one
6231400	6234120	because it sounds like something you'd read on the back of a VHS.
6234120	6239280	And it reminds me of, you know, Lily Tomlin and Mel Brooks
6239280	6242600	are the couple of the 90s in this wacky.
6242620	6243940	Yeah, it's that one.
6243940	6245020	We got that.
6245020	6245900	Brandon?
6245900	6248580	I'm going to go with the daughter, trying
6248580	6251620	to hustle her dad's old products.
6251620	6253060	All right.
6253060	6254020	Well, Brandon has made.
6254020	6255820	I got to go.
6255820	6256500	Oh, you got to go.
6256500	6258700	Well, it sounds like you said he had the right answer.
6258700	6260980	But I was going to guess the last answer, the fifth one,
6260980	6263740	whatever the, what was it?
6263740	6268100	It was the musical.
6268100	6272020	Are you just, you're not trying to give it to me, are you?
6272360	6275320	No, it sounded like he was about to say that you had the right answer.
6275320	6277840	And I don't want to then use that knowledge to cheat.
6277840	6278200	Yeah.
6278200	6278620	All right.
6278620	6281000	So Spencer guessed Ben's.
6281000	6281560	Damn it.
6281560	6283000	Which means Ben gets a point.
6283000	6283920	Yeah.
6283920	6285880	All right.
6285880	6288760	Brandon guessed the right one, which means Brandon gets two points.
6288760	6289560	Right.
6289560	6291760	San Diego, I love you, was in fact a daughter,
6291760	6297040	tries to keep her family together with promoting father's inventions.
6297040	6299200	What was his what were his inventions?
6299200	6300280	Drones.
6300280	6301840	Drones, great.
6302140	6304300	Something like Jurassic weaponized weaponized.
6304300	6310180	Josh and Ben both once again, drawn in by Spencer's perverse ability
6310180	6312860	to emulate a board game.
6312860	6313980	Wow.
6313980	6316360	I mean, that really does what you when you look at it.
6316360	6317700	It makes a lot of sense.
6317700	6319300	He's like a balder dash ringer.
6319300	6321540	Part person, part dash.
6321540	6322140	Yeah.
6322140	6322980	All right.
6322980	6324940	Are you still keeping score to which you play?
6324940	6326860	I think I'm at six.
6326860	6328820	I think I'm at six to maybe someone has two.
6328820	6329780	I think you have two.
6329780	6331500	I got two from the first round.
6331500	6333840	Yeah, you got one this round.
6333840	6336760	So we make this last one for a thousand points.
6336760	6338960	Sounds great.
6338960	6341000	All right.
6341000	6345640	You know, Andy, I want you on deck, but you're not going yet.
6345640	6347680	We're going to get better at this, but this third round,
6347680	6351360	we're going to show you how this fucking this is going to go good.
6351360	6352440	It's been going good.
6355880	6356560	Yeah, we are.
6356560	6358360	They're bringing see so back just for this.
6358360	6360520	Oh, great.
6360660	6365580	Brought to you by balder dash and see so see so we spent too much money on you
6365580	6374380	guys see so you saw it coming see so nothing left to see.
6374380	6376020	So check out a hulu.
6380740	6385580	I guess I'll do a category of peculiar people.
6385580	6388620	So this is just a name here past these blank ones.
6388680	6390120	It's like a historical figure.
6390120	6392320	It's not necessarily true.
6392320	6395680	It's just a name that you say you just have to hear.
6395680	6402880	I'll pick an example one so that we can get the tone like peculiar people.
6402880	6405560	Example would be O'Shea Jackson.
6405560	6410160	And then the answer is the real name of Raptor actor Ice Cube.
6410160	6413800	Well, geez, well, that was a bad thing for them to include.
6413800	6415920	What happens when somebody writes the real answer?
6415920	6418280	If you get the if you know the real one,
6418340	6419300	you get some points.
6419300	6420380	You might get like three points.
6420380	6422180	Yeah, but everybody gets a thousand.
6422180	6424820	So you would get well, we're not I was kidding.
6424820	6427140	I don't want to I don't want to fuck that up.
6427140	6428420	So Christmas is ruined.
6428420	6429540	Excellent. Oh, right.
6429540	6431860	That means I'm almost certainly going to win.
6431860	6434380	Yeah, I need those points to feed my family, Dan.
6434380	6435500	Yeah, we can do double points.
6435500	6439900	Maybe we can say you have to win by 10 and just keep playing until.
6439900	6442420	Wow. That we could do.
6442420	6444860	All right. This is a name.
6444880	6451880	The name is Jeremy Bentham, B-E-N-T-H-A-M.
6453440	6454720	And what are we supposed to do?
6454720	6458280	You're supposed to just say who that person is.
6458280	6459960	OK, like why they're notable.
6459960	6461800	Yes. What their deal is.
6461800	6464040	OK. They might be the inventor of peanut butter.
6464040	6466360	They're right. And I give you two minutes of Andy Dick.
6475220	6478360	If you love Christmas
6478360	6482060	Nativity at the Crystal Cathedral, you'll love this next act.

6490880	6494540	OK, two hangers, a mallet.
6494540	6497180	Looks like a one by six.

6642820	6645020	Well, you can just tell us how you're doing. How are you?
6646860	6650360	Well, that was certainly an action.
6650360	6652320	So he's angry. He's angry at me.
6653320	6659200	There's nothing better than a scruffy figure tossed a traffic cone onto the stage.
6659900	6664300	The doctor, the doctor, the doctor, the doctor, the doctor.
6664940	6670200	Hey, the doctor, the doctor, the doctor, the doctor, the doctor.

6685540	6687540	And now with my kids, they're all here right now.
6687560	6690100	Because you just you told a great dorm tale about the Christmas.
6690800	6692160	That one on vice.
6692160	6694760	Yes. This year, you've got to have something different planned.
6695060	6696700	Or are you going to revisit that shit?
6696700	6697800	No, no, no, no, no.
6697800	6699600	Something else? No.
6699600	6703640	Well, it's probably going to be, you know, the Yuletide log, something low key.
6703640	6705000	Yeah, very low key.
6705000	6706640	You're invited. Thank you so much.
6706640	6708940	I'm always invited to your stuff.

6722340	6724540	He's had a standing invite.
6724540	6726300	He just doesn't know where you heard him.
6726300	6727640	You heard him.
6728640	6732640	You went to Santa Barbara last week and you were caught in the fires.
6732900	6734300	Yeah. Have you talked about that?
6734300	6736400	No, I didn't. He was.
6736400	6740940	I'm going to talk about he was caught in the fires like trapped.
6742140	6744100	Tell him. And don't forget.
6744100	6746600	Dan, tell us about the Paul McCartney song when you get a chance.
6746600	6749560	I had the I had like the now we'll talk about that next week.
6749860	6752120	Like next week will be our Christmas episode.
6752120	6754020	We'll talk about the Paul McCartney Christmas song.
6754020	6755260	Excellent. Which one?
6755260	6758160	Which is a very polarizing song.
6758160	6760000	That piece of shit. Horrible.
6760000	6761460	You don't like. Thank you.
6761460	6762560	It's the worst fucking Christmas.
6762560	6763620	How do you met him?
6763620	6764620	No, I haven't.
6764620	6765960	I don't hate Paul McCartney.
6765960	6767460	I hate his Christmas song.
6767460	6769420	OK, that's probably it's probably shitty.
6769420	6773160	And hates a correct generous word
6773160	6776920	because it doesn't that song doesn't deserve my activation.
6776920	6779080	It's anyways.
6779180	6780180	But he did so many.
6780180	6781280	OK, yeah. Anybody.
6781280	6784020	Anybody who starts a sentence with the word simply can fuck off.
6785520	6789020	Oh, do they know it's Christmas after all is kind of a shitty one for me.
6790220	6791720	Yeah. Yeah.
6791720	6793320	The snow is way inserted.
6793320	6794680	The lights are on.
6794680	6796060	The gifts are out.
6796060	6797080	That's enough.
6797080	6799460	Fuck it. Simply half.
6799920	6802260	It's like the laziest fucking Christmas song.
6802500	6804360	Oh, the Santa's here.
6804360	6806240	The deer can fly.
6806240	6808800	The fucking snow is falling.
6808800	6810100	What else do you want?
6810100	6811400	I'm a beetle.
6811400	6814340	And you can feel his fucking muscles.
6814340	6819460	Adrafi and then for it to be in every jukebox and for everyone to fall for that.
6819460	6824160	It's like we need better education, a better critical thinking skills.
6824160	6825800	We need kids to be out there going.
6825800	6827500	I'm not going to play this on the jukebox.
6827500	6830560	This is ridiculous. It has four notes.
6830600	6832600	It sounds like you.
6832600	6834400	Darlene Love.
6835200	6839600	Let's let's wrap this up with the results of this last round of all the dash.
6839600	6841480	All right. Well, thank you, Andy.
6841480	6844840	Yes, go to Andy's Periscope if you want to give me more.
6844840	6846740	I mean, Periscope has changed.
6846740	6847640	I'm gray listed.
6847640	6848620	Did we get into that?
6848620	6849880	Where do I put this microphone?
6849880	6851520	You just put it in there. Yeah.
6851520	6855420	Or you can I can't work again for three months.
6855420	6857160	That's what gray means. Yeah.
6857820	6860260	And for three months.
6860260	6861260	No, that's his estimate.
6861260	6863860	And he's and he's using the phrase gray listed to refer to him.
6863860	6866960	I would using an algorithm that I came up with in my face.
6867800	6871100	It's like he has a base.
6871100	6872400	I need a base.
6872400	6874140	There's a lot of people that are rooting for Andy.
6874140	6876880	And he's yeah, it's Andy says gray listed.
6876880	6879740	I think what he means not to put words in his mouth, but I am.
6879740	6880640	Everybody loves Andy.
6880640	6883780	But yeah, he can't get work because it's like like that.
6883780	6886280	So he's not blacklisted because it's not like, oh, you're
6886280	6889060	there's some reason that you're you're you're banned.
6889160	6892420	It's like, oh, there's no there's no denial of it or whatever.
6892420	6896260	It's like we'll keep track of Andy and his and his travails.
6897100	6900460	He's he was he was he was he was periscoping from here.
6900460	6902740	And now Periscope has some tip feature.
6902740	6906480	I believe Andy is 100 percent subsisting on Periscope right.
6906480	6908180	Wow. Please give.
6908180	6909440	It's an it's a new business.
6909440	6910480	You don't have to wait for Periscope.
6910480	6912820	You can you can give anyway.
6912820	6915480	We're going to be doing an Andy Dick telethon later on.
6915720	6917520	All right. Operators are standing by.
6917520	6919720	Yeah, I like that.
6919880	6924380	I do like that like the post Weinstein, like the sex scandal, all this stuff.
6924380	6927480	And I was like, no, Andy's going to survive this fine
6927480	6930920	because he's a human hurricane, because like the one headline about Andy
6930920	6935760	Dick that that came out during that whole purge was like the headline
6936060	6938060	was so complicated, it tripped over itself.
6938060	6942840	It was like Andy Dick confesses to sexual assault,
6942840	6946980	asks the cameraman if he's married, falls down, eats a trash bag.
6946980	6949140	And like, like ends up marrying somebody.
6949840	6952340	It was like the headline is like, like, leave this guy alone.
6952340	6953740	Yeah, like he's not either.
6953740	6956640	You're not knocking anyone down a peg if you're if you're if you're going
6956640	6960280	for Andy Dick, like he's he's he's he's he's on his own journey.
6960520	6962080	Very honest, very open.
6962080	6964480	He may be the one he may be the last man standing.
6966720	6969360	All right. I hope you didn't mind me speaking about him like that.
6969360	6971820	Well, he's standing off stage that's nice.
6971820	6974760	No, he's he's he's in the back.
6974760	6975900	All right.
6976620	6980120	So your your question was, who is this?
6980220	6983020	Wait, the name was.
6983020	6986860	OK. I didn't write it down yet.
6986900	6989360	The name is Jeremy Bentham.
6989360	6994560	But Jeremy Bentham, the possibilities of Jeremy Bentham are he is.
6995560	6997900	Assuming he. You're welcome.
7001740	7003860	He is one of seven genders or two sexes.
7004460	7006980	All right. He is musician Adam Ants.
7009020	7011120	A noted moral philosopher.
7013920	7017560	His preserved body is on display at a London university.
7019160	7021560	The boy who ate the most spaghetti.
7021920	7022920	Dammit.
7025220	7026420	I think that's a good answer.
7026420	7027520	That's a good answer.
7027520	7028720	I've been getting stoned on stage.
7028720	7030620	I think that's a good answer. Yeah, fuck that dude.
7033940	7036040	The first I'm sorry, I'm drunk.
7036040	7039440	The first Puerto Rican short stop for the Padres.
7039500	7041040	Oh, Los Jeremy Bentham.
7041040	7043240	Yeah, those answers again.
7043240	7048760	Jeremy Bentham is either musician Adam Ants, a noted moral philosopher.
7049560	7053000	His preserved body is on display at a London university.
7053260	7058960	The boy who ate the most spaghetti or the first Puerto Rican short stop for the Padres.
7059960	7062340	Puerto Rican.
7062340	7065940	Puerto. Puerto Rican.
7068640	7070100	Who should go first?
7070100	7072000	Spencer, you get first try.
7072000	7073100	It's OK.
7074100	7076440	The first answer, the what was it?
7076440	7078040	Adam Ant? Adam Ant. Yeah, sure.
7078040	7080200	That's a Spencer guess for Adam Ants.
7081500	7083700	All right. Ben Nelson.
7083700	7086500	I'm going to go with the body in the university.
7087440	7088940	All right.
7089100	7089940	Josh.
7091180	7093580	Although I want to say the boy who ate the most spaghetti.
7094980	7096980	Because it's a great answer.
7096980	7099840	I'm going to have to go with Adam Ant because I'm just going to follow
7099840	7101780	whatever Spencer does in a board game. All right.
7102880	7104980	I'm going to go with philosopher.
7106280	7107280	All right.
7107280	7111640	Well, this is a complicated round, most notably because Josh and Draski
7111640	7116640	high fived his own answer to thank someone was going to take it.
7117640	7119080	Like someone was going to guess.
7119080	7119780	He's just trying.
7119780	7121340	He's just thought maybe he could psych Brandon out.
7121340	7123380	He's like, well, I'd love to say the boy's spaghetti.
7125380	7127540	I'm I'm I'm on my last limb here, man.
7127540	7129340	I didn't come here to make podcast friends.
7129340	7131920	By the way, it's also complicated because there are two right answers.
7131980	7136780	It's it. Oh, look at the drama.
7137580	7141080	Wait, there. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, because you knew.
7142220	7142820	Oh, of course.
7142820	7144380	Well, the college college
7144400	7148740	college master knows knows everything that goes out of the college,
7148740	7152280	including if a body is preserved in the at a university in London.
7152280	7154640	You killed a guy and put him in your university
7154640	7156880	and his name happened to be Jeremy Bentham.
7156880	7159680	I don't think that you count for points.
7159680	7161240	Wait, so Ben, was that your guess?
7161240	7165780	No, it was an is a noted moral philosopher as well. Oh, wait.
7165780	7169480	But you knew, but you knew both were correct, but you decided to.
7169480	7172280	I didn't know which feature Jeremy Bentham was the answer.
7172580	7176840	Well, but you must have known that no one was going to just riff
7176840	7179580	that his body was preserved in a I don't know.
7179580	7180800	Why am I yelling at you?
7180800	7182100	The college dude.
7182100	7184600	OK, that answer, that's just fault.
7184600	7187040	Well, look, he's the smartest person up here, man.
7187300	7189700	He redesigns colleges, man. I know.
7189700	7192340	Well, that's why it complicates Balderdash, because like, like,
7192340	7194940	if we didn't have him up there here, we wouldn't know
7194940	7200100	he was a noted moral philosopher, in which case Brandon and Ben
7200940	7202500	both would have technically guessed Brian.
7202500	7205660	But we because Ben's up here, we know that Ben guessed right.
7205660	7206760	Along with Brandon.
7206760	7207800	I don't know how to score it.
7207800	7209460	Well, who gave the right answer?
7209460	7211560	They wrote exactly who wrote it.
7211560	7213560	Did you wrote spaghetti, right?
7213560	7216600	Oh, oh, oh, well, I wrote the noted moral philosopher.
7216600	7217760	Three points.
7217760	7220700	But I also guess that he was buried in the.
7220700	7223360	And then you get two points for that, I think.
7223360	7224560	Oh, I think we're tied.
7224560	7227860	Right. So you're so familiar with Jeremy Bentham that you were like,
7227920	7230460	that you were writing my answer.
7230460	7232080	Oh, yeah. So I think you win.
7232080	7233620	Oh, right. OK.
7233620	7235380	And that's how we treat guests anyway.
7235380	7236980	Yeah. Yeah. You know what?
7236980	7238980	Give them 900 points.
7238980	7241180	Well, yeah, I think you get seven points for the game.
7241320	7244760	Ben Nelson has won Balderdash and America.
7244760	7246360	That's going to go on my tombstone.
7246360	7248680	Now, Ben, your prize is that you get to tell us,
7248680	7251580	you get to spend the end of this podcast telling kids out there.
7251580	7254580	And like, like, how do they if they want to
7255080	7257520	if they're interested in what you've been talking about,
7257520	7259980	like, where do they go?
7259980	7264980	Dotcom wise, geography wise, like, what do they do to get sucked into your
7266980	7269120	to your black hole of advancement?
7269120	7273760	So if you if you are if you are so inclined, you can just type Minerva
7273760	7276960	into Google, it'll it'll come up, but you can go to a Minerva.
7276960	7278460	And the ERVA.
7278460	7280500	And that's how dumb we've become.
7280500	7285140	And if you type the name of this Roman goddess into into Google,
7285160	7288400	the first thing that will come up is the guy who's using it for his educational program.
7288400	7293640	Sometimes Wikipedia will will outrank us, but we're one of one or two.
7294040	7295000	She's Athena.
7295000	7295940	She's the Roman version.
7295940	7299240	She's the Roman version of Athena and the inspiration for Constitution.
7299240	7301540	So and the goddess of wisdom.
7301540	7306640	But so that, yeah, just just start Google and Minerva and or go to a project dotcom.
7307040	7311000	This is for people in particular who are like, like, look, man, I've had it.
7311200	7314500	I want to participate in this Moonraker project educationally.
7314520	7316720	I want to become a super, super thinker.
7316720	7322360	And like, I don't trust the current system, even whether or not I can afford it.
7322360	7327560	It fucking is going to end with me in a drip pan of society or president.
7328000	7333400	Yeah, these are people who believe that training your mind is as important
7333400	7336560	as, you know, athletes think training their bodies are.
7337060	7340460	So if you think that training your mind is important, Minerva is where you should be.
7341000	7343960	And Josh Andraski, we just brought back because he was an awesome guest last time.
7344060	7347260	Actually, I want to have Josh back regularly just to tell us about shit
7347260	7351320	that like would normally make us sad, but we're going to turn into little games and things.
7351360	7353460	But we didn't have a chance to do that this time.
7353460	7354160	I'll be back.
7354160	7356320	Which is a thank you. I appreciate you coming back.
7356320	7359920	And I appreciate you guys tangling and not not dismissing each other.
7359920	7361420	Even though you had some disagreements.
7361420	7362720	It was interesting to hear you guys talk.
7362720	7369020	For a second, I felt like I might be a an award worthy cable access host.
7370720	7373220	I hear there's a certain PBS interview show.
7373220	7375020	That's not as a vacancy. So
7377720	7380960	yeah, thank you both for coming by and and everybody out there.
7380960	7382020	What did we learn this week?
7382020	7384060	Give Andy Dick two minutes and.
7385820	7386920	And he will break your heart.
7386920	7389660	And he could change your life.
7389660	7391120	At least add some lyrics.ispy.com
7403680	7407580	Hey, hey, hey, hey, thanks for coming home on time.
7407980	7410620	Thanks for coming to see Dan down.
7410980	7415320	So you guys laugh, but once Moby gets a hold of these recordings,
7415320	7417320	he's going to add a beat and this is going to
7418220	7420320	and he's going to be suing him.
7420320	7424380	All right. Well, then she pops his pimple.
7426320	7428320	Shit. All right.
7429080	7430980	Are we going out on we're going under the beat?
7430980	7433180	Yeah. Well, oh, well, I think we're.
7433180	7434440	I mean, we're so we're done.
7434440	7435580	We could just thank people.
7435580	7436840	Do you have a list of people to thank?
7436840	7438940	Do you have a written or a list of people to thank?
7438940	7441380	I think you I think you off the top of my head.
7441380	7444040	I would say thank Chris Barov for being the director.
7444340	7447080	Thank Zach McKeever for doing for directing all the audio.
7447080	7450380	Thanks, Sarah Hill, for for doing a bunch of shit
7450380	7453220	that we should probably have her up here and explain everything that she does.
7453820	7456380	I keep I keep I keep dismissively saying she's the person
7456380	7457620	who hands me all the titles.
7457620	7460080	What about Steve Lee? Steve Levy's wandering around out there.
7460580	7462720	Zach, the audio maniac.
7462720	7465580	I do want to think, yes, we already think Zach.
7465720	7470920	I do want to thank Nolan, who continues to try to permit the castle
7470920	7473320	so that we can have an audience back in there one day
7473320	7475080	while while wrangling everything.
7475080	7479280	And and and and special thanks to Brian Baldinger.
7479280	7483020	Yes, or Baldinger, depending on whether you're from Norwegia or not.
7484580	7486220	For putting us in touch with Ben and
7488480	7489320	I don't know who else.
7489320	7492320	There's probably some interns that are like going to sue us later.
7493080	7497820	Oh, Andy, Dick, thank you, Andy, Dick, for thank you.
7497820	7498620	I think that's it.
