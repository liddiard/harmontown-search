19600	27500	ðŸŽµ Hey world! Hey world! ðŸŽµ
27500	29500	Welcome once again to Hollywood, California,
29500	31500	Delt Down comics with a nerd in our theater.
31500	33500	Harman Town is now in session.
33500	42500	ðŸŽµ
42500	45500	Would you please welcome the stage, the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
45500	51500	ðŸŽµ
51500	53500	Hello, thank you.
54500	62500	Another record setting crowd.
62500	68500	It was really hard to not tell you guys about the community thing last week.
68500	75500	If you were here, I was sitting on that, that was a sharp secret to sit on.
75500	79500	I'm not known for my secretiveness.
79500	81500	Do you think if you had...
81500	83500	Secretions.
83500	86500	I am known for various secretions.
86500	89500	You're primarily known for your secretions.
89500	93500	Do you think that you said something last week that you could have queered the deal in some way?
93500	97500	Racist.
97500	103500	No, I just would have gotten yelled at by people whose job is to do an unqueered deal.
103500	106500	My agent, publicist, you know.
106500	114500	I would have made their job harder by announcing, you know, there's actors, deals closing, writers, deals closing, my deal closing, blah, blah, blah.
114500	117500	I just don't really know how the stuff works.
117500	120500	I just know that I get yelled at when I say too much, too soon.
120500	123500	So what is the deal now? What do we now have to say?
123500	128500	Thirteen episodes on the inimitable Yahoo! network.
128500	138500	The home of great television.
138500	140500	Wait, what?
140500	153500	Jeff, not since the Lycos I Love Lucy merger has a search engine and a television show that's so aptly paired.
154500	159500	What's your favorite Yahoo! TV show?
159500	169500	You know, I talked to the chief marketing officer, the CMO, I didn't even know that was a thing, on the phone.
169500	171500	Is he Native American?
171500	180500	She is a very powerful woman, Jeff, who can crush us with a phone call or a text message.
181500	184500	Why would they be Native American?
184500	187500	Her name is Chief Marketing Officer.
187500	189500	Oh, Jesus Christ.
189500	193500	Oh, boy.
193500	197500	Dan, there was much power in your TV show.
197500	202500	There was great magic in the op-ed character.
203500	208500	My viewership soars like a spirit.
208500	211500	Like the baby eagle leaving its chest.
211500	216500	Why is this okay? Is it just because they're vanishing?
216500	221500	They have no chance of mounting a...
221500	226500	I think I'm empowering Native Americans by insulting them to chief marketing executives.
226500	234500	I think it's fine, but compared to other things that aren't fine, I'm just wondering, these poor...
234500	237500	I miss the old Dan who didn't care about any of that shit, man.
237500	239500	Oh, God, are you kidding me?
239500	243500	I wouldn't survive this world. The world has changed under our feet, bro.
243500	245500	The world has changed you, man.
245500	248500	Well, I mean, I've become super hyper-conscious of...
248500	251500	You know, I look back like eight years ago, I would just liberally...
251500	259500	I don't know. I called my brother a fag on Twitter because he said he loved his daughter.
262500	269500	That was the beginning of my realization that the world had changed because my brother tweeted,
269500	273500	I love my daughter so much, I just replied fag.
273500	281500	And then real responses from people going like, that's incredibly rude and tacky and hurtful
281500	284500	and a word that's been used to hurt people on playgrounds.
284500	286500	You, of all people, should know about bullying.
286500	289500	I was catastrified.
289500	295500	We're going to bring somebody up in a minute that knows bigger words and how to use them,
295500	297500	so I'm not going to enter his territory.
297500	300500	Are you saying catastrified is not an actual word?
300500	302500	I don't know, is it? We'll find out when he comes up.
302500	304500	I was mortified, let's say that.
304500	311500	I wasn't really looking at myself through that camera, so I do think I got healthier by some of this.
311500	318500	I also think that, you know, the millennial outrage movement is a neo-fascist one
318500	322500	and that it's incredibly dangerous to put so much value on words
322500	326500	because some of the worst people in the world put value on language.
326500	329500	Some of the worst people in the world pride themselves on their diplomacy
329500	333500	and use language to get away with horrible behavior.
333500	340500	So it's dangerous to focus so much energy on cleansing the world of bad words
340500	346500	because you're going to be in the same camp as Snickers and the Pentagon.
346500	350500	What did you just say?
350500	353500	Catastrified?
353500	359500	Oh, Snickers and the Pentagon, okay.
359500	362500	Oh, Jesus.
362500	370500	Jeff's racism unfurls like a mighty teepee flag.
370500	376500	Much hatred expressed in your language.
376500	378500	Keep going, baby.
378500	380500	I love doing that accent, that voice.
380500	385500	I think it's like the same actor that we're all doing when we do a Native American guy.
385500	390500	Isn't it like a specific actor that talks like this?
390500	391500	No?
391500	394500	When we get our guest out, he might know.
394500	396500	It's Burt Lancaster.
396500	397500	Okay.
397500	398500	Shit, shit.
398500	403500	One more thing before we start the celebrity train rolling.
403500	404500	Fuck, fuck.
404500	405500	God damn it.
405500	409500	It was right on the tip of my dumb 41-year-old Swiss cheese brain.
409500	410500	No, no.
410500	411500	Oh, yeah.
411500	415500	I have some drunk voicemails from the head of Yahoo.
415500	421500	It seems like a good idea just to seal the deal.
421500	422500	God damn it.
422500	423500	Shit, shit.
423500	424500	I totally forgot.
424500	425500	Oh, oh.
425500	426500	I was on the plane.
426500	429500	Dino pointed this out.
429500	431500	He was quoting someone.
431500	438500	I feel like it was Louis C.K. or somebody was talking about this, how all of the pilots,
438500	443500	when they talk, they're all doing an impression of Chuck Yeager.
443500	446500	They don't even realize they're doing it.
446500	451500	They're talking the way they think airplane people should talk right about now.
451500	452500	Look out your window.
452500	453500	There's Topeka.
453500	455500	Who gives a fuck?
455500	458500	Those people need to shut the fuck up, man.
458500	459500	That's not new comedic territory.
459500	460500	Right.
460500	464500	I had to, and the peanuts are too small, but I'm saying, it seems like every passing year,
464500	466500	the pilots got more shit to say.
466500	470500	I'm telling you, I mean, I know you had to go to school to do what you do, but you're
470500	477500	pressing three buttons, and it's a flying tube, and you just got to shut up.
477500	479500	You didn't go into broadcasting.
479500	487500	If that's your passion, if you want to talk to people, I'm trying to play Pokemon or something.
487500	493500	I refreshingly had a pilot who, to give you a vocal approximation, Yosemite Sam.
493500	497500	He sounded like Yosemite Sam, like, all right, everybody's just buckling in.
497500	500500	We're going to go over to Rocky Mountains now.
500500	507500	He sounded like the instructions on Big Thunder Mountain did the right thing.
507500	511500	Keep your hands and arms inside the plane at all times.
511500	514500	Here's the wildest ride in the wilderness.
514500	519500	He said, I saw him coming up, we were in the jetway, the airway, the walkway when you
519500	525500	get on the fucker, and he kept coming through, make a hole, make a hole, I'm coming through.
525500	528500	He said, I got to get this paperwork right.
528500	531500	He got on the plane, then came back out and came back up the aisle.
531500	533500	We're all waiting to get on the plane.
533500	535500	He's like, we're not leaving until this paperwork is right.
535500	536500	We're not leaving.
536500	538500	Paperwork is wrong.
538500	539500	He came back and got on the plane.
539500	540500	We're like, this is our pilot.
540500	542500	He seems all right.
543500	546500	Then we get on and he goes, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go over to the Rocky Mountains
546500	547500	right now.
547500	550500	I got some telemetry information.
550500	554500	It's the worst turbulence you've probably ever been through in your life.
554500	560500	I'm telling you all right now, and I'm not trying to alarm anybody, put your seat belts
560500	565500	on as tight as you can put them on and keep them on until I tell you to not keep them
565500	569500	on because we're going to go through some bad turbulence.
570500	572500	He kept saying, I'm not trying to alarm you.
572500	575500	I'm just saying this is no joke.
575500	578500	Then we went over to the Rockies and it was like, if you didn't have your seat belt on,
578500	580500	you would have had a broken neck.
580500	585500	Then he kind of smug, I guess I wasn't fucking with you people, was I?
588500	591500	Looks like someone knows their air travel.
592500	595500	I'm the rootinest, tootest.
596500	600500	The pilot on my flight from Miami to Dallas, I caught a glimpse of him.
600500	605500	You know how they do this thing, they put the lunch wagon in front of the thing to block
605500	607500	the 9-11-ers?
608500	611500	Because everything changed after 9-11.
611500	613500	Everything for us changed.
613500	615500	We have to take off our shoes.
615500	616500	We have to get naked.
616500	618500	We have to have rectal exams.
618500	623500	But when the pilot has to take a shit, they put the fucking lunch wagon in front of the door.
624500	626500	Is it a literal lunch wagon?
626500	633500	The dessert cart is the fine line between us and another national tragedy.
634500	638500	You always get to see the pilot when he drops his deuce or whatever.
639500	643500	That guy came out and I didn't even realize I had standards for pilots' wardrobe.
643500	644500	I really do like them.
644500	649500	I want them to look like military, kind of really put together, tucked in and stuff.
649500	655500	This guy came out, he had fucking oak-ly sunglasses balanced up on the top of his head,
655500	657500	like a Jason Biggs character.
659500	661500	He had his shirt all unbuttoned.
661500	665500	He looked like Gary Busey in a Bachelor movie from the 80s.
665500	670500	It was just like the wingman, no pun intended, the fratty.
671500	676500	It was just like, Jesus Christ man, put on a fucking outfit that looks like you can fly a plane.
676500	678500	I'm scared shitless over here.
678500	682500	They had those safety videos when they're on VHS and the shit's all wobbly.
683500	685500	There's exits over.
686500	693500	It's like, you can't get your TV to work and you're in charge of my body being 30,000 feet above.
693500	696500	I know they're not connected, but I'm alarmed.
697500	700500	I said under my breath because they were the flight attendants,
700500	705500	it took two of them to push the CRT TV back into the ceiling of the thing
705500	709500	after a ridiculous Gremlins era tape played.
710500	714500	I think there were flashes, like there was shit that had been recorded over it at one point
714500	717500	because they accidentally taped over the hole.
717500	720500	You'd get that reference if you were my age.
722500	726500	They fucking shoved the TV back in and it took two of them, they couldn't get it.
726500	731500	I unconsciously said, this is not something you should say in an airplane.
732500	737500	I'm a bad person for saying this, but I just blurted out, we're all going to die.
739500	743500	God bless his heart, the flight attendant, he said, don't say that.
743500	745500	I was like, oh fuck.
745500	748500	It's true eventually, but not today.
751500	753500	He was a delight.
753500	757500	If I was a flight attendant and somebody in first class was like, we're all going to die,
757500	762500	and looking like me and sitting next to Dino, a couple of drunk Sasquatches.
763500	767500	I'm surprised he kicked off the plane, but he made me happy.
767500	774500	I felt like, okay, so the TV's shitty, but this guy, maybe he can save us if shit goes bad.
775500	778500	You said earlier that you don't want to fly anymore, you're through flying?
778500	780500	It's just getting fucking scared.
780500	783500	I feel like I'm playing with statistics.
783500	788500	I know it doesn't make any sense, you're safer than if you go in a car or whatever,
788500	793500	but when you're in a car, your life isn't being controlled by people that feel like,
793500	796500	did you think we were supposed to be working at a phone store?
796500	801500	They're strangers and they have their rules, and these are the last people,
801500	805500	these are the people you're going to die with, and it really freaks me out.
805500	806500	I'm a control freak.
806500	808500	I don't like doctors, I don't like airplanes.
808500	811500	I'm not backing down on this position.
811500	812500	I think they should be outlawed.
812500	818500	I think doctors and airplanes, these people die.
820500	823500	The last person you see is a doctor before you die, usually.
823500	827500	And how come if doctors are so smart, how come they don't live longer?
828500	832500	Why is there no study that says doctors live longer on average?
832500	835500	I'll tell you why, because it's all fucking guesswork, it's all bullshit.
835500	836500	Listen to this.
837500	841500	How come they can't take care of that?
841500	843500	What's going on down here?
843500	844500	Fix it.
844500	846500	Harry Potter?
846500	847500	Dumbledore?
847500	851500	Get out your fucking broomstick and get in there and fix it.
851500	852500	Oh, we can't.
852500	853500	Yeah, you can't.
853500	854500	I can't either.
854500	856500	Except your dad was rich.
856500	857500	It's the only difference.
859500	861500	Come on, let's get out our friends.
861500	863500	You want to pick first?
863500	867500	Yeah, I think we should bring Mr. Greg Proops out first.
886500	887500	Hello, Gregory.
887500	888500	Hi.
888500	889500	Hello, everybody.
889500	890500	Sorry, I didn't take too long.
890500	891500	I didn't keep you waiting, did I?
892500	898500	No, no, we were having a lovely discussion backstage about how airline travel is the safest way to travel.
900500	903500	A stagecoach is more vulnerable to turbulence.
903500	906500	Greg, tell Dan about our flight on Air Macedonia.
906500	912500	Okay, so we were playing in Kosovo because our career is on fucking fire.
912500	923500	I think when you play a place known for genocide and mass graves, fucking comedy.
923500	926500	They say you play Kosovo on the way up and on the way down.
926500	927500	It was great to be back.
933500	935500	What's the origin of that bit?
935500	937500	Oh, golly, I don't know.
937500	938500	I've used it for a thousand years.
938500	944500	So we get up at pre-dawn and we leave from Skopje, Macedonia, where we're staying at the Holiday Inn.
944500	949500	I had my laundry done there, and I can still smell the detergent 11 years later.
950500	954500	I don't know if pink has a scent, but it did in Macedonia.
954500	961500	And so we pitch us up to the airport, and it's bright black out, and like we have coffee.
961500	962500	Oh, yeah.
962500	963500	We have coffee and whatnot.
963500	964500	Pre-dawn.
964500	965500	Pre-dawn.
965500	967500	And like the radon and tebby, thank you.
967500	973500	By the way, I don't know if any of you have taken a ride through Kosovo recently or ever.
974500	976500	Do you like filth?
976500	978500	Do I just?
978500	983500	We were going through it, and it's bleak and it's sad, and it's poverty.
983500	987500	It's not Calcutta, but it's very bleak and sad.
987500	991500	And we couldn't quite put a finger on it, and someone pointed out, there's a thing that you don't notice yet.
991500	993500	There are no birds.
994500	997500	There's no wildlife there, because there's that many unexploded landmines or anything else.
997500	999500	And no dogs at all.
999500	1000500	Yeah.
1000500	1003500	Once in a while you'll see a dog, but occasionally in the middle of the night you're, boom!
1003500	1005500	And then you see a dog link fly over your head.
1005500	1006500	Oh, come on.
1006500	1007500	No, for real.
1007500	1008500	Oh, yeah.
1008500	1010500	No, there's so much unexploded ordinance there.
1010500	1012500	But you guys never saw a dog fly over your head.
1012500	1013500	That's all I'm saying.
1013500	1014500	That's like a...
1014500	1015500	Oh, no, no.
1015500	1017500	Every morning right before sausages.
1018500	1019500	Boom.
1019500	1020500	Boom, and you'd be like, oh, fuck.
1020500	1021500	I'm like, you know what?
1021500	1023500	Would you give me some more banana milk?
1024500	1030500	So we go on the tarmac, and there's no security as such, right?
1030500	1032500	Like, your bags are on the tarmac.
1032500	1036500	And we're there doing a USO tour show, so this is well after 9-11.
1036500	1039500	We're performing for the troops in and around Afghanistan and stuff.
1039500	1043500	Oh, and so you're required to point at your bag to identify that that's your bag.
1043500	1047500	And that's some total of the fucking right, like you point and they go, okay, get on.
1047500	1052500	So the plane is battered, dented, has graffiti on it, misspelled.
1052500	1057500	It says Air Macedonia in Macedonian letters, right, in Greek letters, complete like...
1057500	1059500	There was peeling duct tape on a part of it.
1059500	1060500	It was fucking...
1060500	1061500	Holy shit.
1061500	1064500	And Sean Masterson is with us, goes like, I don't know about this aircraft.
1064500	1065500	I'm like, don't worry.
1065500	1066500	It'll be fine.
1066500	1069500	And we get in first class, and we take stuff.
1069500	1070500	And there's no...
1070500	1074500	You know how you were saying the lunch wagon, which I love, because I love the 50s.
1075500	1077500	I couldn't think of the word cart.
1077500	1078500	My brain is dying.
1078500	1082500	If there's a lunch wagon, I'm ordering a tuna salad and macaroni and cheese.
1082500	1084500	I lost the word cart.
1085500	1086500	Senior moment.
1086500	1088500	There's no door on the cockpit.
1088500	1094500	You know how on like USA or whatever, they'll have like a sealed door with a bar across it,
1094500	1096500	like Frankenstein's lair or whatever.
1096500	1098500	This was Macedonia.
1098500	1099500	No door at all.
1099500	1103500	As soon as we take off, the pilots turn to each other and light up smokes and start talking.
1104500	1107500	And they never look at the road the whole fucking time, right?
1107500	1108500	We go over the Alps.
1108500	1109500	Smoking.
1109500	1110500	Fucking smoking?
1110500	1111500	Smoking in the cockpit.
1111500	1114500	Facing 90 degree angles, like not looking out the window.
1114500	1115500	Oh, no, like this.
1115500	1116500	This is the view you're seeing.
1116500	1118500	You're looking in the cockpit.
1118500	1119500	And they're talking.
1119500	1122500	Then we get over fucking Amsterdam and you hear beep, beep, beep.
1122500	1126500	The automatic pilot goes off, and they go, fuck, and put out their smokes.
1127500	1132500	Sean Masterson in our group, he's a nervous, not only friend of ours, who's lovely,
1132500	1134500	and he calls the flight attendant over.
1134500	1136500	Oh, by the way, the best food in the world.
1136500	1137500	What was it for breakfast?
1137500	1142500	Stale bread, Turkish coffee, olives, yogurt, feta cheese, and honey.
1142500	1143500	Yeah, fucking great.
1143500	1144500	It was awesome.
1144500	1145500	It was really good.
1145500	1146500	It was really awesome.
1146500	1147500	And the flight attendant comes over.
1147500	1148500	We're starving.
1148500	1152500	The flight attendant comes over and Sean's like, are they supposed to be smoking?
1152500	1155500	Shouldn't they be looking at the road?
1156500	1159500	And she goes, they like to watch.
1161500	1164500	They like to look at the party happening back in the face of us.
1165500	1167500	What are you going to see with a plane?
1167500	1169500	What are you going to steer around a mountain?
1170500	1171500	Yes.
1172500	1173500	Precisely.
1174500	1175500	Precisely.
1175500	1177500	I mean, I think they know the routes by now.
1177500	1179500	There's no mountains on that route.
1179500	1181500	Close the door and put the cigarette on.
1181500	1182500	Push a button.
1182500	1184500	I loved it, man.
1184500	1186500	I really wanted to go up there and have a drink with them.
1186500	1187500	You know what I mean?
1187500	1188500	What do you guys drink?
1188500	1189500	Uzo and shit?
1189500	1190500	Let's do the song.
1190500	1193500	When I was a kid, like late 70s, we'd fly to Hawaii.
1193500	1196500	As little kids, every man on the plane wore a suit.
1196500	1197500	Oh, yeah.
1197500	1198500	Every woman wore a dress.
1198500	1199500	And everybody smoked.
1199500	1200500	Oh, yeah.
1200500	1204500	As soon as you were up in the air, everybody lit up.
1204500	1206500	And every armrest had an ashtray in it.
1206500	1207500	Oh, yeah.
1207500	1208500	I remember smoking.
1208500	1210500	You could still smoke on international flights when I was still a smoker.
1210500	1211500	That would become the rule.
1211500	1213500	I remember smoking on a plane going to Mexico.
1213500	1214500	Oh, hell, yeah.
1214500	1216500	Such a weird memory to have that you could go.
1216500	1218500	And there was a smoking section.
1218500	1219500	You could smoke in the back.
1219500	1221500	Yeah, you're on a tube.
1221500	1226500	Our whole attitude about smoking, I remember it changing around me.
1226500	1228500	And I remember being pissed at my friends.
1228500	1230500	They were asking me to not smoke in their apartments.
1230500	1234500	I was entitled to fucking smoking in their apartment.
1234500	1237500	My brain had to shift again.
1237500	1239500	The world's changing, man.
1239500	1241500	The cigarette stuff.
1241500	1243500	And not for the better.
1243500	1248500	If this was the old days, we'd all be doing, blowing, smoking right here in this room, man.
1248500	1251500	If this was a 70s podcast, and those would have been awesome.
1251500	1257500	Because we'd have had lots of cubic hair, and Elliot Gould would have been the special guest.
1257500	1260500	That was all Dick Cavett and stuff.
1260500	1261500	Oh, hell, yeah.
1261500	1265500	Before talk shows became profitable, before they became a way to plug things and stuff,
1265500	1268500	it was just like, okay, the national anthem's going to start in a little bit.
1268500	1273500	But while you fall asleep, here's John Lennon drinking with Truman Capote,
1273500	1276500	talking about how high he is.
1276500	1277500	And it's just quiet.
1277500	1281500	In fact, this is like long pauses and just one shot, one camera.
1281500	1282500	Oh, yeah.
1282500	1283500	That's great.
1283500	1284500	That's what podcasting is now.
1284500	1286500	I mean, listen to us.
1286500	1289500	That's what I love about podcasting.
1289500	1294500	Because it's like, who could have predicted in this world of increasing bandwidth
1294500	1300500	and shrinking attention spans that there would be an art form where people listen to people babble for two hours.
1300500	1301500	I love that you think it's an art form.
1301500	1303500	I think that's fantastic.
1303500	1304500	All right.
1304500	1305500	I wrote it.
1305500	1307500	I feel elevated.
1307500	1314500	I thought I was just a hacky road comic running out the last stretch of my fucking golden years.
1314500	1315500	I mean, I think-
1315500	1317500	What we used to call radio.
1317500	1318500	I think a glass of milk is an art form.
1318500	1319500	I have a really low standard.
1319500	1321500	No, I think it is an art form.
1321500	1323500	And I think you're right, because we don't have parameters.
1323500	1324500	Until all the shit hits the fan.
1324500	1325500	But we won't get into that.
1325500	1326500	That's too depressing.
1326500	1328500	But you went through a phase because you didn't have commercials.
1328500	1329500	Then you did.
1329500	1330500	Now you don't again, right?
1330500	1331500	I don't know if I do or not.
1331500	1336500	I don't listen to all of my show because I find myself repetitive.
1336500	1343500	And I feel like the drunk that's been cornered at the party, you know, like the guy's telling you the same story for the 50th time.
1343500	1345500	That's what I feel like my podcast is.
1345500	1349500	I'm really weirdly selective about which ones, episodes of this show I listen to, which I don't.
1349500	1350500	There's ones that I just wanted.
1350500	1351500	I'm like, that was fucking dumb.
1351500	1354500	I was drunk and sloppy and hate myself.
1354500	1359500	And I don't want to kind of fucking want to hear about the World Cup anymore.
1359500	1360500	I love the World Cup.
1360500	1361500	Oh, yeah.
1361500	1362500	We have a lot to talk.
1362500	1363500	Well, let's not do it.
1363500	1366500	Oh, God.
1366500	1368500	That fucking the Costa Rica game.
1368500	1373500	Did anyone see the football loving chicken that's Costa Rica's mascot, Doc and San Jose?
1373500	1376500	That was the best part of the entire World Cup because the two guys.
1376500	1380500	Greg, I warned you last time a fancy guy in a suit shouted us down about talking about sports.
1380500	1381500	We're talking about sports at the back.
1381500	1382500	Oh, I forgot.
1382500	1384500	We're talking about sports at a comic book store.
1384500	1387500	That's like talking about pussy at a comic book store.
1387500	1390500	It's something that's only been discussed.
1390500	1391500	Oh, I see.
1391500	1392500	You're sensitive.
1392500	1393500	That's fantastic.
1393500	1396500	I want to know when you develop taste.
1396500	1398500	When did that weird moment occur?
1398500	1402500	I was here at the beginning and I watched you and now all of a sudden.
1402500	1403500	Wow.
1403500	1404500	Yeah.
1404500	1405500	Okay.
1406500	1411500	The two guys are the British guys who do the horrible ESPN because before I thought Alexei
1411500	1415500	Lawless was just kind of inane, but now I openly hate Alexei Lawless.
1415500	1416500	I like Alexei Lawless.
1416500	1417500	Do you really?
1417500	1419500	I find him, you know, I'm often accused of being smug, but I don't think I'm smug.
1419500	1422500	I think I'm contentious.
1422500	1424500	No, you're imperious.
1424500	1426500	I am imperious, but I admit it.
1426500	1431500	But Alexei Lawless guys like the American team and you're like, fuck you.
1431500	1434500	You were a midfielder and you sucked balls.
1434500	1435500	Okay.
1435500	1437500	I saw you in the 90, 94.
1437500	1440500	I saw all the fucking World Cups you were in, bro-homme.
1440500	1443500	And this team's better than any American team you were on.
1443500	1448500	I will always find it fascinating that you, who are like an erudite kind of pedagogue type.
1448500	1449500	Sissy.
1449500	1450500	Sissy.
1450500	1452500	That you are a huge sports fan.
1452500	1455500	This guy loves baseball more than anybody you've ever met.
1455500	1460500	Well, again, baseball, did you guys ever see the movie like Bull Durham or whatnot?
1460500	1462500	That's what baseball is.
1462500	1468500	Or Major League 3 Back to the Miners, which is the best title for a movie in the history of mankind.
1468500	1472500	Because if it's Major League 3, how can it be Back to the Miners?
1472500	1474500	You fucked yourself with the title.
1474500	1477500	That meeting was the worst meeting that ever happened in Hollywood.
1477500	1479500	I actually never even thought about that.
1479500	1480500	You're right.
1480500	1481500	It's right in the name.
1481500	1486500	You can't be alien for no alien this time.
1486500	1488500	What do you mean Back to the Miners?
1488500	1489500	It's Major League.
1489500	1491500	The movie's called Major Back to the Miners.
1491500	1492500	There's other movies that do that.
1492500	1494500	What are other titles that did that?
1494500	1495500	Bad News Bears.
1495500	1500500	It's all good news.
1500500	1504500	This isn't an example of that, but there was the sequel to that Open Water.
1504500	1506500	Remember Open Water 2?
1506500	1507500	The Unspoken Subtitle?
1507500	1509500	No Sharks this time?
1509500	1510500	Yeah, right.
1510500	1512500	We got rid of the sharks.
1512500	1513500	Because water's scary enough.
1513500	1515500	You can drown in it.
1515500	1517500	And it's wet.
1518500	1519500	You're so uncomfortable.
1519500	1522500	If you tread it for an hour, you'll get tired and then you can die.
1522500	1523500	I have a cramp.
1523500	1526500	I ate a tuna sandwich too soon before this happened.
1526500	1529500	It was like watching one of those Hands on a Heart Body competitions.
1529500	1532500	Like you're just watching people slowly drown.
1532500	1535500	Anyways, why don't we keep the guest train rolling?
1535500	1538500	Let's bring out soccer expert Kumail Najiani.
1538500	1540500	Yeah!
1547500	1549500	Apple of its eyes.
1553500	1557500	Yeah, we got a lot of heat for the soccer talk last week.
1557500	1559500	Well, it was pretty.
1559500	1561500	I mean, it was...
1561500	1565500	After a point we had covered, it was just you asking over and over again,
1565500	1567500	why can't there be a countdown like a clock?
1567500	1568500	Why can't they pause the clock?
1568500	1570500	And I actually got it.
1570500	1572500	After listening to it...
1572500	1576500	Well, we got to do it again because now we're talking about the thing that we talked about
1576500	1577500	for way too long.
1577500	1579500	But I just want to say I do get it now.
1579500	1581500	I get it because it's like the people fall down.
1581500	1582500	I think it's a sport that has...
1582500	1585500	Its league has more integrity than American sports.
1585500	1586500	It's like they just...
1586500	1587500	They're...
1587500	1588500	Because they're like all...
1588500	1590500	They're all amazing actors.
1590500	1593500	Like if you like do this, they're like, oh, my face fell off.
1598500	1602500	I literally saw one where two guys' calves gently grazed each other
1602500	1604500	and they laid on the ground clutching their faces.
1605500	1606500	For two minutes.
1606500	1609500	Because what they don't know is that I don't think that these guys
1609500	1612500	have figured out the fact that there are nine million cameras,
1612500	1614500	by definition, on the moment.
1614500	1618500	Also, there are 20 cameras at least that have the perfect slow-mo.
1618500	1621500	So when you get hit, like there's a guy that kind of...
1621500	1625500	A foot came up and grazed the back of a guy's head and he crushed his nose,
1625500	1627500	which is clearly bullshit.
1627500	1629500	But when you play in slow-mo, it's hilarious.
1629500	1632500	Well, maybe his brain came and hit the nose.
1633500	1634500	I hope...
1634500	1636500	I think that that guy who bit...
1636500	1638500	My favorite was the guy who bit the other guy
1638500	1640500	and then got kicked out of the World Cup.
1640500	1641500	Suarez.
1641500	1643500	Yeah, Suarez was one of the best players in the world, apparently.
1643500	1644500	Chewy Lewis.
1644500	1645500	I liked it.
1645500	1646500	I liked...
1647500	1648500	Chewy Lewis.
1648500	1649500	Oh, Huffington Post.
1649500	1651500	Because they played the Italians who are called the...
1651500	1653500	The Blues in Italian.
1653500	1655500	They're called the Blues because they always wear blue.
1655500	1658500	The Huffington Post article was Chewy Lewis and the Blues.
1659500	1660500	Wait.
1661500	1662500	Lewis Suarez.
1662500	1663500	Oh, his name is...
1663500	1664500	You know what?
1664500	1666500	I thought that was dumb and now that I know his name's Lewis...
1666500	1667500	No, it's a home run.
1667500	1668500	It's fucking...
1668500	1669500	It's a home run.
1669500	1670500	It's a home run.
1670500	1674500	That should be the last newspaper published in the world.
1675500	1676500	But he, when he...
1676500	1678500	I thought it was so ballsy when he bit the guy,
1678500	1680500	he laid down being like,
1680500	1681500	I hurt my teeth, too.
1681500	1682500	Like, he was like...
1682500	1685500	What he did, he went in and fucking...
1685500	1688500	Well, I have one less bullet in my gun, so...
1689500	1690500	It got robbed, in a sense.
1690500	1693500	He jumped in and nose-far out to Keilini from the Italians.
1693500	1696500	And he probably did almost hurt his teeth on a guy's...
1696500	1698500	On an athlete's shoulder.
1698500	1700500	Like, you can't just go, I run.
1701500	1703500	Did you notice that he bit the Italian team?
1703500	1705500	No one bit the Russians.
1705500	1706500	You know what I mean?
1706500	1708500	You bite the Russians, you're like, this tastes like cabbage.
1708500	1710500	You bite the Italian team, you're like...
1710500	1711500	Mascarpone.
1711500	1712500	Oh, my God.
1712500	1714500	This is delicioso.
1714500	1715500	It's filled with butter and...
1715500	1717500	It's both abandoned.
1718500	1720500	In Russia, soccer bite you.
1721500	1723500	Is this true, Anatoly?
1725500	1726500	Soccer-recognized soccer.
1726500	1727500	Oh, my God.
1727500	1729500	God damn it, we talked about sports again.
1729500	1730500	We did it again.
1730500	1731500	No, we're not.
1731500	1733500	We're talking about how delicious Italian people taste.
1733500	1734500	I won't say...
1734500	1737500	Italian tastes like Spirit of Eagle.
1738500	1739500	It's Jay Silverheels.
1739500	1740500	That's the actor.
1740500	1741500	Is that the actor?
1741500	1742500	Jay Silverheels.
1742500	1743500	Who's the actor?
1743500	1744500	Jay Silverheels.
1744500	1745500	Can you play Tondo?
1745500	1746500	Can you play Tondo?
1746500	1750500	You go, kimosabe, many miles to next stop.
1751500	1753500	Gee, Tondo, I wonder.
1754500	1756500	Might we run into some hostiles along the way?
1756500	1758500	Many hostiles, kimosabe.
1759500	1761500	Was he trying to fuck the Lone Ranger?
1762500	1763500	Yes.
1763500	1770500	Like Batman and Robin, there was an alter universe where the Lone Ranger and Tondo, I think, were a deep couple.
1770500	1774500	Are you saying this character is sort of like Apu is for my people?
1774500	1777500	Except for my people, the guys, it's a white guy.
1777500	1781500	We couldn't even get one of our own to sell out our whole race.
1781500	1782500	Let me explain something to you.
1782500	1785500	White people can do a lot of voices.
1786500	1789500	It's what we really excel at, genetically, is racism.
1789500	1792500	Do you remember Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto?
1793500	1796500	We love to mock non-whites.
1796500	1798500	Warner Oland as Charlie Chan.
1798500	1800500	Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
1800500	1803500	Oh, man, such a beautiful Asian accent.
1804500	1806500	He's like a ballerina.
1807500	1810500	It's just a shame that there were no Asian actors in Hollywood at that time.
1810500	1811500	Yeah.
1811500	1813500	And, yeah, that's true.
1814500	1818500	Yeah, that is amazing to watch, like how far we've come in a little.
1819500	1823500	Okay, we won't talk about soccer, but I will say, I won't talk about soccer.
1823500	1826500	I'll say about planes and smoking, one of my weirdest memories.
1826500	1829500	This is kind of a weird story, so you have to sort of be okay with that.
1829500	1832500	I forget where I was flying, but I was flying somewhere with my family.
1832500	1834500	And there was a smoking section in the back of the plane.
1834500	1839500	And while I was on the way to the bathroom, this guy sort of, and I was like eight, started talking.
1839500	1840500	It's just a weird story.
1840500	1842500	Is this a flight around Pakistan?
1842500	1844500	No, it's like an international flight, but I don't remember how long.
1844500	1847500	Probably just Singapore, so it's probably about three hours.
1847500	1850500	So this guy referenced me, and he's like, here, come sit next to me.
1850500	1853500	This is already a weird story.
1853500	1855500	That's already the weirdest thing that's ever happened on a plane.
1855500	1856500	No, it's no good.
1856500	1859500	Have you been to the lunch wagon yet?
1860500	1863500	The lunch wagon is blocking the captain's borders.
1863500	1866500	Hank Azaria?
1867500	1871500	So I tried to say, have lunch, maybe some chapatis?
1873500	1878500	The plural of chapati is chapati, but it's impressive that you knew the word.
1878500	1880500	Pack a snap.
1880500	1882500	Pack a snap.
1882500	1884500	Pack a snap.
1884500	1887500	You did not just pack a snap, man.
1887500	1889500	I'm going to bang my fucking deshi back.
1889500	1891500	That just derailed the whole episode.
1891500	1892500	Pack a snap.
1892500	1893500	Pack a snap.
1893500	1895500	Pack a snap.
1895500	1897500	I feel them on soon.
1897500	1898500	Come in on.
1898500	1899500	I feel them on soon.
1899500	1900500	Come in on.
1900500	1901500	All right.
1901500	1905500	So this guy, I sit next to him, and he's drinking, and I didn't know anybody who drank then.
1905500	1907500	Well, you were eight.
1907500	1911500	Yeah, and also nobody drank in Pakistan, but this guy was Pakistani way older than me,
1911500	1913500	and he was like, here, try this whiskey.
1913500	1914500	Oh, no.
1914500	1915500	Wait, whoa.
1915500	1918500	I'm telling you it's a weird story.
1918500	1919500	Holy shit.
1919500	1921500	So my mom came and was like, what the fuck?
1921500	1925500	And she like grabbed me and went up, and then the next time I was going to the bathroom,
1925500	1928500	she's like, hey, just he was like, hey, sit with me again.
1928500	1929500	Sit with me.
1929500	1930500	I don't know.
1930500	1932500	And I was like, I didn't know how to say no.
1932500	1934500	Wait, has he crossed the aisle from you?
1934500	1936500	No, he's like in a different section.
1936500	1940500	So I'm like probably like 40 rows in front of him.
1940500	1944500	And then there's like curtains, and then the smoking section, he's in the smoking section.
1944500	1947500	So I'm going to the bathroom again, and he's like, all right, sit with me.
1947500	1948500	So I sat with him again.
1948500	1949500	My mom came and got me.
1949500	1952500	And I remember very clearly my mom took me up and had to start with me, where she was
1952500	1956500	like, hey, sometimes people want to do bad things to children.
1956500	1958500	And I remember being like, me?
1958500	1963500	Like I was like, this predator wanted to prey on me?
1963500	1964500	Wait, you were flattered?
1964500	1967500	I was flattered.
1967500	1970500	I was like, little old me?
1970500	1972500	I was going to get preyed on.
1973500	1975500	I wasn't sure about these shirts.
1975500	1976500	I didn't know.
1976500	1979500	I thought maybe we'd put these shirts together when I looked at them.
1979500	1980500	You're wrong, mom.
1980500	1981500	I am beautiful.
1985500	1991500	You tweeted a picture of yourself around that age, and you looked so much like Milhouse
1991500	1992500	from The Simpsons.
1992500	1993500	Well, yeah.
1993500	1994500	It was adorable.
1994500	1996500	That was when I was like four.
1996500	1997500	That was great.
1997500	2003500	From like seven to like 18 was a real bag of trash.
2003500	2006500	So this guy, so you needed this validation.
2006500	2007500	No, no.
2007500	2010500	I came at the perfect time.
2010500	2013500	I was all confident for a little while after that.
2013500	2016500	You were walking with a swagger through baggage claim?
2016500	2018500	A chalk-dipped man with whiskey.
2018500	2019500	Yeah.
2019500	2021500	I don't need you little girls like me.
2021500	2024500	I have grown men who are into me.
2024500	2029500	Aaron and I were just watching the Roger Ebert documentary.
2029500	2031500	Is it tough to watch?
2031500	2033500	Because I think that guy is amazing.
2033500	2037500	It's really hard to watch because he's a great guy, and therefore you should watch it.
2037500	2039500	No, it's not hard.
2039500	2044500	It's inspiring because something terrible is happening to a person that doesn't deserve it
2044500	2051500	and coping with that and watching him fucking just charge headlong into the oblivion
2051500	2055500	with a, you know, I was going to say with a smile on his face
2055500	2058500	and then I ran through all these fucking, yeah.
2058500	2059500	I'm sorry.
2059500	2061500	That's how my brain works and what happened.
2061500	2068500	Thank you for proving that I was right to have vapor lock for a second.
2068500	2077500	But it's a good documentary that will, yeah, it's a nice, watch it.
2077500	2085500	The relationship between Siskel and Ebert, there's a story that Siskel's wife tells.
2085500	2089500	I thought, you know, when I was a kid growing up watching these guys, I was like,
2089500	2090500	well, they hate each other.
2090500	2092500	That's what's for sale, but it's kind of an act.
2092500	2096500	It's like Ernie and Bert, which is true, but they also really did hate each other.
2096500	2097500	They really did?
2097500	2100500	They really hated each other, but they also loved each other.
2100500	2105500	That part of the documentary is also very touching, but it's way more so,
2106500	2109500	more important part of the documentary is Ebert's relationship with his wife.
2109500	2115500	And it's a tear bringer.
2115500	2116500	Not a joker?
2116500	2120500	Much tears brought by this tear bringer.
2120500	2122500	There's a story in it.
2122500	2124500	How many tears have you brought?
2124500	2126500	Given the airplane theme of the story.
2126500	2130500	So Siskel and Ebert are on an airplane flying somewhere,
2130500	2132500	and Siskel is tired of listening to Ebert.
2132500	2134500	This sounds like a good joke.
2135500	2137500	So he's going to fuck it up.
2140500	2142500	Ebert's telling the same story.
2142500	2144500	Siskel doesn't want to hear it anymore.
2144500	2148500	So Siskel gets a napkin and writes a note on it that says,
2148500	2152500	Mr. Ebert, we're here in the cockpit.
2152500	2155500	We found out you're on the plane.
2155500	2159500	We admire you much more than that other guy.
2159500	2162500	We really agree with your movie reviews more than his.
2162500	2166500	And it would be an honor if you would join us in the cockpit.
2166500	2169500	Just talk about movies with us for a while.
2169500	2173500	So I gave the note, had the flight attendant hand Ebert the note.
2173500	2176500	Ebert goes bounding down the aisle.
2176500	2180500	Starts pounding on the cockpit door.
2180500	2182500	It's a funny story.
2182500	2185500	And then everyone's like, what the fuck is this fat guy doing?
2185500	2188500	He's trying to destroy the plane.
2189500	2193500	Siskel calls out from his seat that he just yells out like,
2193500	2195500	Mr. Ebert, we in the cockpit.
2195500	2198500	He yells out the first line of the letter.
2198500	2199500	That's how the story ends.
2199500	2201500	It was an airplane theme.
2201500	2206500	There's a great article that Ebert wrote because he lost his lower jaw.
2206500	2207500	And so he couldn't eat.
2207500	2208500	So he was on tubes and stuff.
2208500	2212500	He wrote this wonderful article about how he experiences food now,
2212500	2217500	how he looks at pictures of food and recalls wonderful meals he's had.
2217500	2219500	And he's like, don't feel sorry for me.
2219500	2220500	I'm still having that experience.
2220500	2224500	And he talks about his best meals as a guy who will never taste again.
2224500	2227500	It's really, really fantastic.
2227500	2228500	It's a real tear-breaker.
2228500	2229500	It's really great.
2229500	2230500	It really is a great article.
2230500	2233500	The end of his life is one of the most inspiring chapters of it
2233500	2242500	because he very quickly adopted the blogging lifestyle because he had no edge.
2242500	2245500	And he became right up to the finish line.
2245500	2248500	He was one of the coolest bloggers and tweeters.
2248500	2252500	And it's kind of amazing that not only can you not fear death,
2252500	2256500	but you can actually get some of your better shit done right before it,
2256500	2258500	even when you're staring at the face.
2258500	2262500	Kind of cool, but also really fucked up because why, Harold Ramis?
2262500	2263500	Why, Roger Ebert?
2263500	2266500	Why do bad things happen to people that we admire in the answers?
2266500	2267500	So many thoroughbreds.
2267500	2272500	When there's so many, we could spare down here.
2272500	2280500	Let's bring out a couples therapy veteran and love of my life, Aaron McGathey.
2294500	2297500	The gang's all back.
2297500	2299500	I don't even have to say anything.
2299500	2302500	I've got so many bright, shiny superstars up here.
2302500	2311500	All of you bringing your own brand of rye stuff to the thing.
2311500	2315500	And then it should just be silence for two minutes.
2315500	2319500	Camille's story about the alcohol reminded me...
2319500	2321500	I didn't try alcohol, by the way.
2321500	2327500	So, Mom, if you're listening, I also did not fuck that man.
2327500	2330500	Although he did go to the bathroom two times at least on a three-hour flight.
2330500	2335500	So, whatever.
2335500	2338500	I was hydrating a lot.
2338500	2342500	We wouldn't be flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet.
2342500	2346500	Isn't it weird that we can poop on planes?
2346500	2348500	You would think that they would throw that out there.
2348500	2351500	Bruce.
2351500	2353500	I've never pooped on a plane.
2353500	2355500	You've never pooped on a plane?
2355500	2357500	It's like the first thing I do.
2357500	2359500	For real?
2359500	2361500	Is that a power thing?
2361500	2369500	I'm literally shitting where you were.
2369500	2371500	I don't know what it is.
2371500	2374500	For real, you really get on a plane and immediately have to take a shit?
2374500	2375500	Yeah.
2375500	2378500	You have that weird thing where you eat and food pushes poop out of your body.
2378500	2380500	I'm like a...
2380500	2383500	Yours is just a straight line?
2383500	2384500	Yeah.
2384500	2388500	If I eat a salty cracker, I will poop a salty cracker's worth of poop.
2388500	2391500	I know it's not the cracker, but that's the illusion that's created.
2391500	2396500	It feels like I eat and then it turns into poop like a Polaroid camera.
2396500	2399500	It comes out.
2399500	2401500	It really...
2401500	2403500	It's as if I'm really proud of it.
2403500	2405500	I think it's something that's...
2405500	2407500	What, you're an earthworm?
2407500	2408500	Yeah.
2408500	2410500	My regularity is actually...
2410500	2412500	Startling.
2412500	2415500	In a world where there's lots of things that could go wrong with you.
2415500	2417500	You're comfortable getting...
2417500	2423500	At six foot four, going into a lavatory on a plane is a terrible experience.
2423500	2426500	If I want to go pee on a plane...
2426500	2428500	What do you guys want to do later?
2428500	2430500	I was telling your story, Greg.
2430500	2433500	Scoops, do you want to drink?
2433500	2434500	Sure.
2434500	2436500	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt the podcast.
2436500	2438500	Her name is Scoops?
2438500	2439500	Yeah.
2439500	2442500	I have an issue with us because you hear us call each other...
2442500	2443500	Scoops?
2443500	2444500	Scoops.
2444500	2445500	I guess I don't have an issue.
2445500	2446500	I guess I like it.
2446500	2447500	No.
2447500	2449500	Every time we call each other a pet name, Dan, you've noticed this.
2449500	2450500	Scoops, coops.
2450500	2452500	Jeff goes, coops?
2452500	2453500	Scoops?
2453500	2454500	Every time you want to have...
2454500	2455500	It's Scoops though, right?
2455500	2458500	It's Scoops, or Coops, or Shube, or Shuber.
2458500	2459500	Coober.
2459500	2460500	Or Tony Shalubert.
2460500	2461500	Or Coobrama.
2461500	2462500	Coobrama.
2462500	2463500	Yeah, that's my thing.
2463500	2464500	It's a moving term.
2464500	2465500	Nurb.
2465500	2466500	I always feel like...
2466500	2467500	I thought it was Scoops, but now it's Scoops.
2467500	2470500	Dan, which would our pet name be in front of Jeff?
2470500	2471500	Barack Coobrama.
2471500	2472500	All right.
2472500	2473500	That's awesome.
2473500	2474500	That's settled.
2474500	2478500	It always seems to be slightly moving, so I can't...
2478500	2481500	It's not just Scoops or Scoops.
2481500	2482500	It's always a long, long...
2482500	2485500	The mile I call each other, Coombs and Pooms.
2485500	2487500	You call each other Coops?
2487500	2488500	No.
2488500	2489500	He calls me Coombs, and I call him...
2489500	2490500	Oh, Coombs.
2490500	2491500	Oh, I see.
2491500	2492500	Yeah.
2492500	2493500	You got derailed.
2493500	2494500	Yeah, you were telling this.
2494500	2495500	Yeah, you were saying something about...
2496500	2497500	I was actually...
2497500	2498500	I felt blessed that I was derailed.
2498500	2502500	Because it's just a story about you taking a shit on a plane.
2502500	2505500	No, I thought...
2505500	2510500	When Camille was talking about that man offering you whiskey or whatever it was...
2510500	2511500	Yeah, I think it was with...
2511500	2512500	Jesus juice.
2512500	2513500	Jesus juice.
2513500	2514500	Wow.
2514500	2515500	I had a...
2515500	2516500	I was thinking about...
2516500	2517500	My mind was...
2517500	2522060	I was thinking about plane rides, and I grew up in a Navy family, so we lived in Italy for
2522060	2523060	a while.
2523060	2524700	I lived in Italy.
2524700	2529500	The adults in my life were other chaplains that my dad knew, because my dad was a chaplain,
2529500	2531060	which is like a preacher in the military.
2531060	2532060	I didn't know that.
2532060	2533060	Oh, really?
2533060	2534060	Wow.
2534060	2535060	Yeah.
2535060	2541140	And on any base, there's only one chaplain per faith, so my dad was friends with a rabbi
2541140	2542140	and the others.
2542140	2543140	Oh, so...
2543140	2544140	The other.
2544140	2545140	The other.
2545140	2546140	Oh, yeah.
2546140	2551140	A rabbi, a priest, and the right one walking through...
2552140	2554140	And I had a...
2554140	2556140	So were all your dad's stories...
2556140	2558140	Did they sound like jokes?
2558140	2560140	Yeah, they're always...
2560140	2561140	Yeah.
2561140	2565140	Two Jews walk into a temple.
2565140	2572140	So I had a babysitter who came over twice and would play Old Maid with me, and he was
2572140	2573140	another chaplain.
2573140	2576140	But then we were telling this story, and I remember...
2576140	2580140	And I've never thought of this before and never talked about it, and this does not end,
2580140	2583140	and we are touching, but I had a conversation...
2583140	2587140	I was like nine years old, and I was talking to him about my parents' instant coffee, and
2587140	2588140	I was saying, it's so strange.
2588140	2593140	My parents drink this drink that doesn't taste like other drinks, and it smells strange,
2593140	2595140	and it's really weird.
2595140	2597140	And he gave me brandy.
2597140	2599140	He was like, do you know what this is?
2599140	2600140	What this thing is?
2600140	2602140	This is a rabbi?
2602140	2604140	This was actually a priest.
2604140	2605140	But like, poor...
2605140	2609140	Oh, Aaron, I wonder if you'll be looking over here at the joystick.
2610140	2611140	But he...
2611140	2613140	This is called cough syrup.
2613140	2617140	It'll make the journey so gentle.
2617140	2620140	My father and I have never talked about this.
2620140	2622140	This is called man candy.
2622140	2626140	He was chaplain Nate, and I knew that we stopped...
2626140	2628140	Chaplain Nate was the one who tried to give you brandy.
2628140	2629140	...tried to give me brandy.
2629140	2634140	He stopped babysitting for me because I told my dad that I was going to marry chaplain Nate.
2634140	2638140	And you ended up kind of doing just that.
2639140	2640140	Are you a chaplain Nate?
2640140	2642140	Yeah, because I'm an alcoholic. It was a joke.
2642140	2644140	Yeah, I got it.
2644140	2645140	Sorry.
2645140	2647140	The story's not funny. We're good.
2647140	2649140	No, it's troubling.
2649140	2651140	Yeah, yeah.
2651140	2652140	So let's tell...
2652140	2653140	I thought it was funny.
2653140	2656140	He came over. We played Old Maid. I sat on his...
2656140	2658140	Cock.
2660140	2662140	Wow. Hollywood squares.
2662140	2664140	I'd like to think that you thought...
2664140	2666140	If you're going to pause...
2666140	2668140	I'll tell Jeff Davis to block.
2670140	2671140	If you're going to say...
2671140	2672140	Block.
2672140	2674140	I sat on his and then paused.
2674140	2675140	Someone's going to say something.
2675140	2676140	I think it's so funny.
2676140	2678140	No answer is good, except for shoes.
2679140	2682140	You thought that's what Old Maid was, and then ten years later you're like,
2682140	2683140	Let's play Old Maid!
2683140	2686140	And people are like, Oh, this is not what Old Maid is.
2686140	2687140	What is it?
2687140	2688140	Cock.
2688140	2691140	These are the sweet optic gospels.
2691140	2693140	Okay, so you were sitting on his...
2693140	2696140	laugh. I would sit on his laugh and we would play Old Maid together,
2696140	2697140	and then we would have...
2697140	2698140	How old are you at this point?
2698140	2700140	Nine. Nine.
2700140	2702140	Pretty Old Maid.
2703140	2704140	What is Old Maid?
2704140	2705140	It's a card game.
2705140	2706140	It's a card game.
2706140	2710140	Old Maid always had pictures instead of suits.
2710140	2715140	Yes, and the point of the game is to not end up with the old woman who's alone.
2717140	2720140	Is that the theme of Western society or what?
2721140	2722140	There are all these face cards.
2722140	2725140	There's the barber and the veterinarian,
2725140	2727140	and then there's the Old Maid who no one loves,
2727140	2729140	and you don't want to end up with her.
2729140	2736140	Woman's only value is to give her body for reproductive purposes.
2736140	2737140	But one day she'll...
2737140	2738140	I am the sexist Indian.
2740140	2741140	I can get away with it.
2742140	2743140	I'm vanishing.
2743140	2745140	And I know... I know...
2745140	2746140	I hate women.
2746140	2749140	I know nothing happened, and that doesn't make it okay.
2749140	2751140	But there was a reason why I never saw him again.
2751140	2754140	Did you tell your dad that you sat on his lap and played Old Maid
2754140	2755140	while he offered you brandy?
2755140	2757140	Yes, and that he was going to be my husband some day.
2757140	2758140	I don't know... I can't remember.
2758140	2761140	The brandy thing is a memory that I've...
2761140	2763140	You're not sure if that's real.
2763140	2764140	No, I know that's real.
2764140	2765140	I know that's real.
2765140	2768140	When I was 11, I was headlining at the Fountain Blue Inn.
2769140	2771140	An older man came up to me, he was Jewish,
2771140	2773140	and he gave me a bottle of Moog and David.
2775140	2777140	We played Kabbalah all night long.
2778140	2780140	You can play Kabbalah?
2780140	2781140	In my day.
2782140	2784140	Isn't Kabbalah that religion?
2784140	2786140	I guess it's a game to Greg.
2787140	2790140	There was a game called Kabbalah in the old days.
2790140	2793140	I'm just being a weenus now.
2793140	2794140	I don't actually have a story.
2794140	2797140	I think that was a good call on Aaron's dad's part.
2797140	2798140	No, Kabbalah.
2798140	2799140	Hell yeah.
2799140	2800140	Oh.
2800140	2801140	But it also seems kind of tragic,
2801140	2803140	because I'm also projecting onto this guy.
2803140	2805140	Like, I don't think he met you in any harm.
2806140	2809140	Well, I didn't feel like a dangerous situation.
2809140	2812140	The facts sound dangerous and weird, yeah.
2812140	2814140	They're good at making it not seem dangerous.
2814140	2815140	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2815140	2817140	Why did you want to marry him?
2817140	2818140	Sorry?
2818140	2820140	Why did you want to marry him?
2820140	2822140	Do we all end up talking?
2822140	2823140	Yes, yes.
2824140	2825140	It's jarring for them.
2825140	2827140	Someone in the audience asked why a nine-year-old
2827140	2828140	me wanted to marry him.
2828140	2829140	Audience.
2829140	2831140	Because he gave you attention.
2831140	2832140	Yeah.
2832140	2834140	Greg, easy, easy, Greg.
2834140	2835140	I was a man.
2835140	2837140	You know, when you're a child, you don't really
2837140	2839140	understand what marriage is.
2839140	2841140	You know, I wasn't really turned on by anything.
2841140	2844140	I also wanted to, quote unquote, marry my dentist.
2844140	2845140	I wanted to marry the mailman.
2845140	2846140	I wanted to marry.
2846140	2848140	There's a man who collected stray dogs outside of
2848140	2850140	our house, and I was going to marry him.
2850140	2851140	I wanted to marry my mom.
2851140	2853140	I told my mom I wanted to marry her.
2853140	2855140	Was this before or after you asked if she
2855140	2857140	thought you were handsome?
2858140	2861140	I did that when I was like 20.
2862140	2864140	Mom, am I good looking?
2864140	2865140	I'm afraid to ask other people.
2865140	2867140	You were 20 when that happened?
2867140	2869140	No, I was like probably 17.
2870140	2872140	34.
2873140	2876140	Is there a good age to ask your mom if you're hot?
2878140	2880140	But I think there's a healthy, I mean,
2880140	2885140	kids want to marry their opposite sex parent
2885140	2886140	if they're straight.
2886140	2887140	They have a right to be gay as well.
2887140	2888140	God damn it.
2889140	2893140	The kids go through this, by the way,
2893140	2897140	congratulations, Indiana and fuck the gay rights.
2898140	2899140	Where was it?
2899140	2900140	Indiana and Utah?
2900140	2902140	And they just overturned the thing as unconstitutional.
2902140	2903140	Good job.
2903140	2904140	Gay points for me.
2906140	2908140	You just negated everything you said.
2909140	2912140	Look, how many gay points do you currently have right now?
2913140	2916140	Oh, someone's chair broke in the audience.
2917140	2918140	Oh, shit.
2919140	2920140	They're weak chairs.
2920140	2922140	You probably didn't want me to call attention to that.
2922140	2923140	Godzilla?
2924140	2925140	Those chairs are alone.
2925140	2927140	It happens all the time.
2927140	2930140	Those chairs, there's some old ones in there still
2930140	2932140	and they break all the time.
2932140	2935140	So when my family moved from Italy to the United States,
2935140	2938140	I had chicken pox and you're not allowed to travel
2938140	2941140	with chicken pox, but my parents are so sick of Italy.
2941140	2943140	I have this memory of my mom.
2943140	2945140	In my memory, she's beating me.
2945140	2948140	But it probably wasn't her beating me,
2948140	2949140	but she put makeup all over my face.
2949140	2951140	Didn't tell me what was going on, but put makeup.
2951140	2953140	Were you guys doing the bus and truck company
2953140	2955140	of Godspell on the way home?
2956140	2957140	Thank you.
2957140	2960140	That was for me and for the illuminati.
2963140	2965140	Pedestrians, take a seat.
2965140	2966140	Thank you.
2966140	2967140	I know you did.
2967140	2968140	You have Asperger's.
2968140	2970140	My parents, you're not allowed to take a child
2970140	2972140	with chicken pox onto an international flight.
2972140	2973140	Of course you're not.
2974140	2977140	My parents put makeup all over my 10-year-old face.
2978140	2980140	She doesn't have chicken pox, she's a mime.
2981140	2983140	She's Elizabeth Taylor.
2984140	2986140	She's in a kabuki theater company.
2987140	2988140	She's Joan Cross.
2989140	2991140	She's a dark pageant.
2991140	2993140	The macado opens in two nights.
2994140	2995140	She's just sexy.
2996140	2999140	I wore my mother's scarves so I could wrap them
2999140	3000140	around my face.
3000140	3002140	I had no idea what was going on.
3003140	3005140	I see a little baby with a lot of makeup
3005140	3007140	and scarves around their face.
3008140	3011140	I'd rather have a baby with chicken pox on the plane.
3012140	3015140	Hopefully no one got sick on that flight.
3015140	3017140	That's the end of the story.
3017140	3019140	Where did you guys go from Italy?
3019140	3020140	Texas.
3021140	3023140	Your parents were so bored that they went
3023140	3025140	from Italy to Texas?
3025140	3028140	No, my dad was getting his master's degree
3028140	3030140	at a seminary in Texas for nine months.
3030140	3031140	Boring answer.
3031140	3033140	Do you guys think we should get some feedback
3033140	3034140	about all of this?
3034140	3036140	From Dungeon Master Spencer Crenshaw.
3036140	3037140	Yes.
3038140	3040140	So get ready for me, let's go.
3040140	3042140	I am a comin' nice and cool.
3042140	3044140	I'm gonna march my hearts in time.
3044140	3046140	Don't bring around the flowers.
3046140	3049140	Terrain on my brain.
3052140	3054140	It's exciting, it's exciting.
3054140	3056140	Welcome Spencer, how you doin' my brother?
3056140	3057140	I'm doin' pretty good.
3057140	3059140	No, I mean, I'm good.
3059140	3060140	Who babysat you?
3062140	3064140	I don't know, like, I think there's this one girl.
3064140	3065140	The calculator.
3065140	3067140	I babysat, mostly.
3068140	3071140	Did you, I'm sorry, I wanna hear about how much
3071140	3074140	you loved your babysitter, but did you notice,
3074140	3075140	is this tablecloth a little fancier?
3075140	3078140	They've been really fancying up the room here.
3078140	3079140	Yeah, yeah.
3079140	3080140	Like your Dungeon Master table is.
3080140	3082140	Other than the chairs that explode when people sit.
3082140	3085140	Yeah, the audience doesn't get to anything fancy,
3085140	3086140	but Jeff's podium is full.
3086140	3088140	We're still calling in the audience, huh?
3090140	3092140	Life and proletariat, I'd say.
3092140	3094140	The hoy polloy.
3095140	3099140	Anyways, so did you ever ask your mom to marry you?
3099140	3101140	No, I was wondering about that.
3101140	3104140	I don't think so, but you know, I did get, you know,
3104140	3108140	inappropriate, you know, situations with adults.
3108140	3109140	All right.
3110140	3111140	Let's hear about one.
3111140	3112140	Okay, here are the top ten.
3112140	3114140	In our new segment.
3114140	3118140	Number ten, Vaughn's parking lot.
3120140	3123140	I went to, my grandparents live up north in Northern California
3123140	3125140	and we went to visit them and.
3125140	3126140	Ferndale?
3126140	3127140	What was it?
3127140	3129140	It's Loyalton was where it was.
3129140	3132140	And there was just some random kind of state fair.
3132140	3133140	What do you call them?
3133140	3134140	A fair carnival.
3134140	3135140	Yeah.
3136140	3139140	With fanciful prizes and rides and attractions
3139140	3142140	and everyone was like having a good time.
3142140	3144140	And I went to try and win one of those, you know,
3144140	3147140	monkeys and I won it because I could knock off a ball
3147140	3153140	or I can knock a bottle with a ball off of a platform.
3153140	3155140	Tell me more about this game.
3157140	3159140	So you have a bottle?
3159140	3160140	I'm unclear on the rules.
3161140	3162140	Is there a timer?
3162140	3163140	Do they press pause?
3163140	3164140	I'm unclear on the physics.
3164140	3166140	There's a rope involved.
3166140	3167140	I like it.
3167140	3168140	Can you use your hands?
3168140	3169140	I think there's sand.
3169140	3171140	It makes it harder.
3171140	3175140	Anyway, I got a monkey and the lady who's the carny.
3176140	3179140	And, you know, don't trust ladies when you're a kid.
3179140	3180140	No, God no.
3180140	3182140	Don't trust carnies either.
3182140	3185140	But I got this monkey and she's like, you know,
3185140	3187140	you can bring your monkey into my jungle any time.
3187140	3189140	And I was like, how are you?
3189140	3190140	I'm nine.
3191140	3192140	Well, did you?
3192140	3193140	No.
3193140	3195140	Did you bring your monkey into her jungle?
3195140	3196140	No.
3196140	3199140	Did you salivate her papaya with your mango?
3200140	3202140	No, but I did peel her banana.
3203140	3204140	She had a banana?
3204140	3205140	That was no lady.
3205140	3206140	That's no lady, my friend.
3207140	3208140	You're telling me.
3209140	3211140	How old was this lady?
3211140	3212140	You know, old.
3212140	3216140	Old enough to set off a long-held prejudice against old people.
3218140	3219140	Too old for a nine-year-old boy.
3219140	3220140	Yeah, definitely.
3221140	3222140	Yeah.
3222140	3223140	All right, what's the next point?
3223140	3224140	Do you have a beard?
3224140	3225140	No.
3225140	3226140	I know.
3226140	3227140	You're trying to picture a nine-year-old Spencer
3227140	3228140	and you can't picture him without a beard.
3228140	3229140	Yeah.
3229140	3230140	That's exactly what's happening to me.
3230140	3232140	I picture Spencer just shorter holding a matchbox car.
3233140	3234140	Yeah.
3234140	3237140	I picture him wearing a little rascal's beard, like a fake beard.
3238140	3239140	That hooks over the ears.
3244140	3245140	Any other cardboard glasses?
3246140	3248140	He didn't need glasses yet, but he made them out of cardboard.
3249140	3250140	Spencer, give me more stories.
3251140	3252140	Was this lady...
3252140	3255140	This is not even an appropriate question, but was she like...
3256140	3257140	Bababoo.
3257140	3258140	Did you think she was attractive?
3258140	3261140	No, I don't think attractive people do stuff like that, right?
3263140	3265140	I don't know, I think that's bigotry.
3266140	3269140	That's probably very attractive pedophiles out there.
3270140	3272140	You'd make a great cop, Spencer.
3275140	3276140	Pull over all the ugly people.
3277140	3278140	They've been jiddling someone.
3280140	3282140	He's too hot to molest.
3283140	3286140	I think you'll find people with money don't commit crimes.
3287140	3289140	Move along, nothing to see here.
3290140	3292140	Alright, next story, Spencer.
3293140	3299140	We're going down your ten molestation brushes of the 20th century.
3300140	3302140	I don't think I have any more molestation stories.
3302140	3303140	Oh, that's the only one?
3303140	3304140	Yeah.
3305140	3306140	We shouldn't be disappointed.
3310140	3311140	I'm just rooting for the underdog.
3311140	3313140	Do you want to go faster?
3314140	3319140	What if he just kept going to carnivals and kept having weird interactions with people?
3320140	3322140	I worked at a carnival for a weekend.
3322140	3323140	It's terrible.
3323140	3324140	Yeah, the milk can game.
3324140	3325140	What did you do?
3325140	3326140	Milk can game.
3326140	3327140	Three balls for a dollar.
3327140	3328140	Yeah, that's the game that I won.
3328140	3329140	Really?
3329140	3331140	It was so confusing in my explanation.
3331140	3335140	I know, but you said you were knocking milk cans off of a platform.
3335140	3337140	This is the milk giant milk can.
3338140	3342140	And the trick is that the hole in the top is exactly the size of the ball.
3343140	3345140	So it's possible to...
3346140	3349140	If people say, I think this is rigged, you can demonstrate that it's not.
3350140	3354140	With a very careful orchestrated motion that I had to be taught to me by a carny.
3355140	3358140	When you shove the ball straight down and it'll go right into the thing.
3359140	3363140	But if you are me and not good at being a carny, and someone says,
3364140	3369140	I think that's rigged and you go to do that, it bounces off of it and through the top of the tent.
3370140	3372140	And everyone rolls into the wall.
3372140	3374140	I want to talk to you about the...
3374140	3376140	Yeah, I mean, no, it's...
3377140	3378140	I don't know, it's not that good.
3378140	3381140	Because if you hit it here, you're fine.
3384140	3385140	Go again, go again.
3385140	3386140	You're fired.
3390140	3392140	That impression makes me so hot.
3395140	3396140	It's not here.
3397140	3398140	It's horrible.
3398140	3399140	There's more stutter.
3399140	3401140	You finally get to have sex with yourself.
3403140	3405140	We finally found a role-playing game.
3406140	3409140	You be me and I'll be me.
3412140	3415140	Knock my milk bottle off this platform with your balls.
3416140	3418140	Get your monkey in my jungle.
3419140	3425140	Hey, Greg Pips, do you have any advice for young, very young couples like myself and Aaron?
3426140	3427140	I do.
3427140	3428140	That are about to get hitched?
3428140	3436140	Well, I've been married a long time now and I think you'll find, Dan, that you need to understand two things about being a man in a marriage.
3436140	3441140	One, it's almost inevitable that whatever you've done is unbelievably erroneous.
3443140	3446140	And that you have to understand that your deficiencies are legion.
3448140	3451140	There is no point in time where you're going to go, I fucking win.
3452140	3462140	Nor is it advisable for you at any point to decide to win an argument and or a scrimmage and or a skirmish and or a battle and or a war.
3463140	3472140	It's a very long road and it's best you'll find, I believe, for young couples starting out on this giant golden journey to the Emerald City.
3474140	3477140	Mutual respect for everything the other one does.
3478140	3483140	In other words, when they come home and go, I had the hardest day today and you go, really, I fucking did this.
3484140	3486140	That's not a big win.
3487140	3493140	That is a truck that rolls into the, you know, the lay by and burst into flames.
3494140	3496140	So I would defer is what I'm saying.
3496140	3499140	Greg, do you do this all the time? Is that the secret to your happy marriage?
3499140	3502140	Now, I haven't learned it after 30 years.
3503140	3504140	But I'm just giving you this.
3504140	3506140	Have you been married? How long have you been married?
3507140	3509140	A while now, 1990.
3510140	3515140	But your relationship is an inspiration to listeners of your podcast because you have so much respect for you.
3515140	3518140	You refer to your wife as formidable.
3518140	3522140	Well, and she is one. She's smarter than me. She's better looking than me.
3522140	3523140	And she's funnier than me.
3523140	3528140	So I have to keep her locked up in a closet almost all the time.
3529140	3531140	Have you guys ever done any counseling or anything?
3531140	3532140	Oh, fuck no.
3532140	3535140	Aaron and I are going to marriage camp.
3536140	3537140	Marriage camp, really?
3538140	3540140	I don't know, but I've been told.
3541140	3543140	Your sister's pussy is mighty cold.
3546140	3547140	Marriage camp?
3547140	3548140	Right.
3548140	3549140	Wow. What's that like?
3549140	3551140	Well, it's not an actual camp.
3551140	3554140	Harman, get over the goddamn obstacle.
3555140	3557140	Go, go, go, go, go.
3558140	3559140	Pile.
3559140	3562140	Greg, I might make you a rifleman in my beloved corps.
3563140	3564140	Greg, will you be?
3564140	3565140	Jeff, look what time it is.
3570140	3576140	Put the lunch wagon in front of the cockpit. Put the lunch wagon in front of the cockpit.
3577140	3578140	Lunch wagon.
3580140	3583140	Greg, we were talking about Major League earlier.
3583140	3586140	Dan, I want to hear what you're saying about marriage counseling.
3586140	3587140	I don't understand.
3587140	3588140	Well, here we go.
3588140	3590140	Goddammit, Dan.
3591140	3595140	If you're writing fucking cartoon shows for the goddamn cartoon network,
3595140	3599140	you pay attention to your wife more and have more fucking harmony at home.
3599140	3600140	Aaron, goddamn it.
3600140	3601140	Stop.
3601140	3604140	I'm about as proud of you as I've ever been in a couple of years.
3608140	3610140	The manager for Major League, everybody.
3611140	3615140	Aaron, stop keep messing around, telling stories about how you fucked your priests
3615140	3617140	when you were five years old and shit.
3618140	3620140	It's not the kind of thing a marriage is built on.
3626140	3629140	I thought the third season of Community was a little trite.
3631140	3632140	Trite.
3632140	3633140	That was fighting words.
3633140	3635140	Season four, it's open season on.
3636140	3640140	Because my dad is a minister and performs a lot of marriages, he requires,
3641140	3644140	and he's not Catholic, but he requires couples to go through a camp,
3644140	3645140	a quote unquote camp.
3645140	3647140	How long has this been true of him?
3647140	3648140	Since the beginning.
3648140	3649140	Wow.
3649140	3651140	And it's like five sessions.
3651140	3653140	Have you guys done more than one?
3654140	3656140	Well, this isn't at the behest of her dad.
3656140	3657140	No, no, no.
3657140	3659140	You're making it sound like we're doing this.
3659140	3662140	No, I mean, I always grew up thinking that that was...
3662140	3663140	Standard.
3663140	3664140	Standard.
3664140	3665140	Like pre-marriage.
3665140	3667140	You go to, you talk to my dad.
3667140	3670140	And if I had a couple of breakout sessions, that was all.
3671140	3672140	Thank you.
3672140	3674140	One person in the whole fucking crowd.
3674140	3677140	Then we had a small meeting and then a confab.
3677140	3678140	And then a breakfast.
3678140	3679140	Then we blue skied for a while.
3679140	3680140	That was all.
3680140	3681140	We spitballed.
3681140	3682140	Blue skied.
3682140	3683140	Thank you.
3683140	3685140	Two people in the fucking room, really?
3685140	3686140	Fuck you.
3686140	3687140	Easy proof.
3687140	3688140	Whatever you're calling yourself.
3688140	3689140	Easy action.
3689140	3690140	Sorry.
3691140	3692140	Easy action.
3692140	3695140	It is really nice having a mediator.
3695140	3699140	I know Dan talked about it at length last episode, but it's been awesome.
3699140	3701140	How many sessions have you guys been to?
3701140	3702140	Only, technically one.
3702140	3703140	We did a consultation.
3703140	3705140	No more sessions since the last.
3705140	3708140	Is there an obstacle course?
3708140	3709140	Yeah.
3709140	3711140	There's this Hall of Mirrors.
3711140	3714140	And Dan has to tell me whether or not I look good.
3715140	3720140	There's just a series of genes that you repeatedly ask me if you look fatted.
3720140	3721140	And then there are all these...
3721140	3723140	Yes, no, yes, yes, no, no.
3723140	3728140	They're these Chris Evans cutouts and I have to just look at Dan amongst us.
3728140	3729140	Yeah.
3729140	3732140	In Hall of Mirrors, you have to be like, which mirror do I look best?
3732140	3734140	And he has to point to you.
3735140	3737140	And not any of the mirrors.
3738140	3739140	This one.
3739140	3743140	There's a bed where there's just a mannequin that comes to the door with pizza and we have
3743140	3747140	to argue about who's going to go down and get it.
3747140	3748140	That's the big...
3748140	3749140	Is that a real...
3749140	3750140	That's the Gettysburg.
3750140	3753140	That's what we fight about.
3753140	3757140	It's like, as soon as there's a doorbell, I take my pants off.
3757140	3759140	And I'm like, oh, you have to go.
3759140	3761140	That's our test too.
3761140	3762140	We do that too.
3762140	3764140	I take my pants off before the...
3764140	3765140	Do you really?
3765140	3766140	Yeah, I do.
3766140	3767140	You both do it.
3767140	3769140	I do that too, but I live alone.
3770140	3773140	And you just like answering the door in your pants.
3773140	3775140	Ding dong, sip.
3775140	3779140	Jeff does it when our pizza guy comes over outside the window.
3779140	3782140	He's just in the garden taking his pants off.
3782140	3783140	He just watches us.
3783140	3784140	He loves it.
3785140	3786140	Yeah, it's amazing.
3790140	3795140	Out of all the fights that we have, we get drunk and we say mean things to each other
3795140	3799140	and we're bad people and we have to apologize in the morning.
3799140	3806140	But I think the ugliest part of us is when the fucking guy comes with the food.
3807140	3810140	We just lay there and try to out-baby each other.
3811140	3813140	But I put my pajamas on!
3813140	3817140	The person who goes down to the door may as well be Joan of Arc.
3817140	3819140	They're a fucking murderer.
3819140	3821140	Once you're like, oh, I'll go.
3821140	3823140	Yeah, oh yeah.
3823140	3824140	How's the pad thai tasting?
3824140	3825140	Is it good?
3827140	3828140	I created it.
3828140	3829140	It was salted with my sweat.
3831140	3835140	Yeah, I think I've just sort of decided I'll just get the door.
3835140	3838140	I've made that decision and now it's way easier.
3838140	3842140	I'll be the one who always goes and it's just...
3842140	3844140	Let me ask you something, Kamal.
3844140	3846140	Do you take the garbage out as well?
3847140	3848140	Yeah.
3848140	3850140	I think you'll find that you do.
3850140	3852140	There's certain tasks that are assigned...
3852140	3853140	Wait, what's going on?
3853140	3854140	What do you know?
3856140	3858140	I'm just giving her an inch.
3858140	3860140	I don't think this is going to go wrong, right?
3860140	3863140	No, I'm saying this is the natural state of things.
3863140	3867140	I'm not being sexist or horrible in any way.
3867140	3871140	I'm saying that you'll find you'll take the garbage out unless you're not there.
3871140	3872140	She actually does.
3872140	3874140	I mean, she does way more around the house than...
3874140	3875140	Oh, obviously.
3875140	3876140	Yeah, she's...
3876140	3877140	We're children.
3877140	3878140	Yeah.
3878140	3879140	We've been infantilized.
3879140	3882140	Oh, our job is to be funny and occasionally...
3882140	3883140	Not with this crowd, but...
3883140	3888140	And from the other part, every 15 to 30 seconds, you know, laughter and whatnot.
3888140	3891140	And then they're there to be your nursemaid and whatnot.
3891140	3892140	Yeah, well...
3892140	3895140	Okay, for us, she's...
3895140	3898140	Just edit every response I've had.
3899140	3902140	No, for us, I mean, the one thing we fight about is...
3902140	3906140	Other than who's going to the door is the balance of work and family.
3906140	3908140	That's the fight we have all the time.
3908140	3909140	What does that mean?
3909140	3912140	Family meaning the two of you or your families?
3912140	3913140	Yeah, the two of us and the house.
3913140	3914140	No, not...
3914140	3915140	We don't give a shit.
3915140	3916140	Yeah, fuck your families.
3916140	3917140	Fuck those people.
3917140	3918140	Yeah.
3918140	3921140	No, I've been screening their calls for a while.
3921140	3923140	Balance with them.
3923140	3924140	Yeah, no.
3924140	3926140	Yeah, balance of...
3926140	3929140	Because she's sort of, you know, she's in the same line of work.
3929140	3931140	Like, she's a writer and producer.
3931140	3935140	So we both sort of work from home and it can happen that you could just...
3935140	3936140	Because we work together, too.
3936140	3938140	So it's hard sometimes, your relationship...
3938140	3940140	You don't want it to become just a work relationship.
3940140	3942140	So we really have rules.
3942140	3945140	Like, you can't talk about work unless you say, let's talk about work.
3945140	3947140	Because we do a bunch of stuff together.
3947140	3952140	And that has really, really helped us sort of negotiate that a lot.
3952140	3957140	Because sometimes, if you're talking about work, sometimes you can get into a fight
3957140	3961140	because you're in the middle of being married and also being a co-worker with someone.
3961140	3966140	You can get into fights that you wouldn't get into if you were in either of those camps.
3966140	3970140	So that was like one thing that we had to sort of figure out.
3970140	3972140	And I think that's been good.
3972140	3974140	You'd be like, did you call so-and-so?
3974140	3978140	Oh, that's my fucking job now?
3978140	3981140	I'm trying to eat a hard boiled egg.
3982140	3986140	I'm allergic to eggs, but the rest of it's pretty accurate.
3986140	3988140	Oh, you're allergic to eggs.
3988140	3992140	Then why didn't you tell me that before I made two?
3992140	3995140	I mean, if you were paying attention for the last seven years...
3995140	3999140	Why don't you eat your fucking yogurt and just sit in the fucking corner, all right?
3999140	4004140	Also, you shouldn't have to try to eat a hard boiled egg.
4004140	4008140	Yeah, you should have that down by now.
4008140	4012140	So are we going to open this fifth bottle of wine or what?
4012140	4013140	Right?
4013140	4014140	That's what marriage is called.
4014140	4015140	Oh, I thought you were...
4015140	4019140	I was immediately like, oh, yeah, we are out of vodka.
4019140	4020140	Are we really?
4020140	4021140	Yeah, I know.
4021140	4022140	It's a record we set here.
4022140	4023140	Is it the first time?
4023140	4024140	We've never run out of vodka.
4024140	4025140	Yeah, we're out of vodka, really.
4025140	4026140	Oh, you know why?
4026140	4027140	Because we have great proofs here.
4027140	4028140	Well, we're not out of it.
4028140	4029140	Oh, you're okay.
4029140	4031140	Camille, your wife is a family...
4031140	4034140	Not practicing right now, but is a licensed family therapist.
4034140	4035140	Yes.
4035140	4038140	I think about you guys a lot.
4038140	4039140	Great.
4039140	4040140	Thank you.
4040140	4041140	No, she is, yeah.
4041140	4045140	How does that affect your relationship in that way?
4045140	4046140	Because she's obviously...
4046140	4052140	She can say, well, Jacobi Nikolmai...
4052140	4055140	Is that a real person?
4055140	4056140	Yes.
4056140	4057140	No, no, no, no.
4057140	4058140	Well, here's what...
4058140	4060140	And my dad is a psychiatrist, too.
4060140	4063140	So we sort of both know...
4063140	4067140	What she'll do is she'll call me on my little bullshit tricks.
4067140	4071140	And being with her, I've understood myself way more than I ever did.
4071140	4074140	So she'll be like, all right, you're angry, but you're not angry at this.
4074140	4075140	What are you really angry at?
4075140	4076140	And I'm like, that's true.
4076140	4079140	Because for me, it's like something is going on.
4079140	4083140	And then I just do a magic eight ball to decide how it's going to come out.
4083140	4088140	It's just like I spin a wheel like, all right, I'm angry at the cat now.
4088140	4090140	There'll be times when I was like...
4090140	4094140	One time she came home and I was just in my underwear looking for this...
4094140	4101140	I was like, I can't find my Bruce Springsteen t-shirt.
4101140	4104140	And she was like, okay, have a seat.
4104140	4106140	Turn on the air conditioner.
4106140	4107140	You're sweating.
4107140	4112140	This isn't about Bruce Springsteen, is it?
4112140	4114140	And it wasn't.
4114140	4116140	I was anxious about a job I was starting.
4116140	4119140	And so that's what she's become...
4119140	4122140	She's helped me realize like what it...
4122140	4126140	Like focus on the thing that I'm actually feeling.
4126140	4128140	You have a Bruce Springsteen t-shirt?
4128140	4130140	I'm a massive Bruce Springsteen fan.
4130140	4131140	Are you really?
4131140	4133140	Yeah.
4133140	4136140	Oh, now they're here.
4136140	4137140	Hooray for you.
4137140	4141140	I didn't know the whole crowd was for fucking T-neck tonight.
4141140	4142140	Nice, T-neck.
4142140	4144140	I got married right by T-neck.
4144140	4145140	Which exit?
4145140	4149140	Everybody.
4149140	4154140	Oh, to go back to what you were saying, Spencer.
4154140	4156140	That was a mic slam.
4156140	4159140	But like a very gentle one.
4159140	4161140	This is a little tied to what you were saying.
4161140	4165140	I hope, by the way, I did a Chris Rock mic drop at this convention in Florida.
4165140	4167140	The fucking mic broke.
4167140	4169140	But it was broken already.
4169140	4170140	That complicates the story.
4170140	4171140	I was holding it.
4171140	4173140	It was in two pieces already.
4173140	4175140	And then I did a bit where it was like...
4175140	4176140	And then it fell apart.
4176140	4177140	And then the engineers were like...
4177140	4180140	And I was like, I'll buy you a mic.
4180140	4184140	And that made them love me.
4184140	4187140	I've never been famous enough to warrant a mic drop.
4187140	4192140	But I do do this all the time.
4192140	4193140	The soft...
4193140	4194140	They've been yelled at it.
4194140	4198140	That's like a catch and release of mic drops.
4198140	4201140	Right when I was getting married, there was a big story.
4201140	4205140	In T-neck, there was a guy who worked at a funeral home.
4205140	4206140	Guess what he was doing?
4206140	4208140	I'll tell you, fucking dead old ladies.
4208140	4210140	Like women in their 80s.
4210140	4211140	And I saw a picture.
4211140	4213140	He was 28 and very handsome.
4213140	4216140	So...
4216140	4219140	You're just into what you're into, man.
4219140	4222140	I like to think that maybe he was so good at sex that he like...
4222140	4228140	It was like going to the hardest difficulty setting in a video game.
4228140	4232140	It's like playing basketball with weights on your ankles.
4232140	4235140	What if it was a corpse?
4235140	4239140	Fuck, I can come in any situation.
4239140	4242140	I can make her come.
4242140	4245140	That is marriage counseling.
4245140	4247140	I can bring this back to life.
4247140	4250140	Not only is she old, she's dead.
4250140	4252140	She died of being old.
4252140	4254140	And I fucked her.
4254140	4255140	I fucked her back to life.
4255140	4257140	We've all been there.
4258140	4259140	What do you think, Spencer?
4259140	4261140	Flies in the face of your profiling?
4261140	4266140	Yeah, I'm really turning a new page in my book.
4266140	4269140	About fucking old ladies.
4269140	4271140	There was a guy digging up old ladies in fucking the...
4271140	4273140	No, he worked at a funeral home.
4273140	4274140	You didn't have to dig him up.
4274140	4275140	You got the right job further.
4275140	4276140	Yeah.
4276140	4279140	He was like, you know, going right to the fucking...
4279140	4281140	Was it only old ladies or was it the fact that there were only old ladies
4281140	4283140	who were currently in the funeral home?
4283140	4284140	I just know that the three...
4284140	4288140	I think if a young lady died, he'd be like, fucking it!
4290140	4292140	It's Christmas!
4293140	4295140	If you're that curvy, I think anything at that point.
4295140	4296140	I think...
4296140	4297140	Carl's Jr.
4297140	4299140	That's so awful.
4299140	4302140	They were both in their 80s, the women that they...
4302140	4304140	And they obviously didn't say the names of the ladies,
4304140	4309140	but the family probably read it like, wait, that's how old Nana was.
4309140	4312140	That's the funeral home we used.
4312140	4315140	It was survived by two cousins in Secaucus.
4315140	4316140	How did he get...
4316140	4318140	Did someone walk in on him?
4318140	4320140	Yeah, that's my question.
4320140	4321140	I think...
4321140	4325140	How do you get caught when you work at a funeral parlor
4325140	4328140	and you just like to fuck dead people?
4328140	4331140	That seems like the perfect little biosphere.
4331140	4335140	Yeah, then you just embalm him and that's like all the evidence is sealed up in there.
4337140	4338140	I don't...
4338140	4339140	Wait, in your head there...
4339140	4342140	In my head, he was pulling out for some reason.
4347140	4349140	Just like, we can't picture Spencer without a beard.
4349140	4351140	You're just like, well, that's how sex ends.
4356140	4357140	Oh my God.
4357140	4358140	Someone did.
4358140	4361140	I feel so bad about Rue McClanahan now.
4362140	4363140	She was so cute.
4365140	4367140	Oh God, I was gonna say something horrible.
4368140	4370140	You've already said a bunch of horrible shit.
4370140	4371140	No, really.
4371140	4373140	I mean, how do you quantify that crime?
4373140	4376140	Like, Dan, if I died and he found out...
4376140	4378140	Because obviously the embalmers would rape me.
4380140	4382140	She's so proud of herself.
4382140	4383140	No, I'm not.
4383140	4384140	No, I am not.
4385140	4388140	Because, you know, my body is dead.
4388140	4391140	What do you want to do to that...
4391140	4392140	What do you do?
4392140	4393140	What do you mean?
4393140	4394140	You fuck it.
4394140	4395140	What is my question someone said?
4395140	4396140	If you found out...
4396140	4398140	I'm asking him to fuck you when you're dead.
4398140	4401140	It really felt like that's where this was going.
4402140	4403140	Well, I'm thinking about...
4403140	4405140	Dan, if you really love her, you'll fuck her when she's dead.
4405140	4411140	I'm imagining finding out that my aunt was raped after she was dead.
4411140	4412140	Okay.
4413140	4417140	I don't know how to place those feelings or what are those feelings,
4417140	4420140	because she's not there and is disrespectful.
4420140	4422140	Like, what is the punishment for that crime?
4422140	4425140	He dies and then he's raped, but he never feels it.
4425140	4426140	I mean, like, what is the...
4426140	4428140	Wait, are you on the side of the guy who's doing...
4428140	4429140	No, no, no, no.
4429140	4431140	No, she's just asking, how do you...
4431140	4433140	No, I'm like, how do you... what is the...
4433140	4435140	Are you saying it's just like at that point...
4435140	4437140	Are you asking if Dan would become Batman and avenge you somewhere?
4437140	4438140	No, I'm not.
4438140	4440140	No, I think she's asking, is there really a crime,
4440140	4444140	because it's just like a piece of furniture now, so...
4444140	4445140	No, I'm not saying is there really...
4445140	4448140	I mean, I'm asking an inappropriate show question.
4448140	4450140	If you could fuck a couch, you could fuck a good lady.
4450140	4452140	What I'm saying is, like, I don't even know...
4452140	4453140	I mean, what do you even...
4453140	4454140	You're saying it's a victimless crime.
4454140	4455140	No, not...
4455140	4457140	Well, it kind of is.
4457140	4458140	I mean, it technically is.
4458140	4459140	Yeah.
4459140	4462140	It depends on your religion, how victimless it is.
4462140	4466140	I wonder if there's another topic besides necrophilia that we have.
4466140	4471140	I can't believe we got to 105 episodes without talking about necrophilia.
4471140	4473140	What's funny is, I was going to say,
4473140	4475140	not qualified, nonconsensual necrophilia,
4475140	4478140	but I guess all of it is.
4478140	4483140	Well, then you might have, like, a special clause in your will.
4484140	4487140	I think the victims are the families when they read in the paper
4487140	4490140	that a guy got caught fucking old ladies of the state.
4490140	4492140	Well, I know, but then, like, what is the...
4492140	4494140	There should be a punishment, but I mean, what is the punishment?
4494140	4496140	Is there a word for it?
4496140	4497140	I think he's in jail.
4497140	4498140	Okay.
4498140	4500140	What category do you put it in, though?
4500140	4504140	Because I think what you do is, if a guy gets caught, let's say,
4504140	4507140	fucking women in the funeral home,
4507140	4512140	what you do is you kill his grandma and you fuck her right in front of him.
4513140	4516140	I mean, that's the answer I was looking for.
4516140	4519140	I mean, that starts the brainstorming session.
4519140	4520140	That's right.
4520140	4521140	I'm just spitballing her, you guys.
4521140	4522140	No wrong answers.
4522140	4524140	Let the punishment fit the crime, is what I'm saying.
4524140	4525140	Well, this is funny.
4525140	4526140	Oh, God.
4526140	4528140	This is not funny.
4528140	4530140	What I'm going to say is not funny.
4530140	4531140	Have more vodka.
4531140	4538140	But there was a serial killer in Pakistan who was going around killing,
4538140	4541140	like, this is a bummer of a story.
4541140	4545140	He was killing little, like, poor kids and dissolving them in acid.
4545140	4546140	This is what he was doing.
4546140	4550140	I'm definitely going to listen to this podcast episode.
4550140	4551140	This is one of the ones that makes the cut.
4551140	4553140	I was going to say, finally, we make the cut.
4553140	4554140	I'm going to listen to this one.
4554140	4558140	He went to the cops and he was like, listen, I've killed like 60-some kids.
4558140	4559140	I want to get to 100.
4559140	4560140	Stop me.
4560140	4562140	And the cops literally, like, laughed and kicked him out.
4562140	4563140	Then he finally got to 100.
4563140	4565140	He was like, I actually did do it.
4565140	4566140	I did it.
4566140	4567140	I killed 100.
4567140	4568140	I told you I was going to.
4568140	4569140	And then I did.
4569140	4574140	And the official punishment, because he dissolved 100 kids in acid,
4574140	4577140	was this was what the court said.
4577140	4581140	Kill him, cut his body into 100 pieces, and then dissolve them in acid.
4581140	4582140	A slam dunk.
4582140	4583140	Yeah.
4583140	4585140	That's a pack of slam.
4585140	4586140	Pack of slam.
4586140	4587140	Pack of slam.
4587140	4588140	Pack of snap.
4588140	4589140	You've been pack of slammed.
4589140	4590140	Pack of snaps.
4590140	4591140	Pack of snap.
4591140	4593140	This week on pack of slammed.
4593140	4596140	This guy thought he could get away with killing 100 children.
4596140	4599140	What he doesn't know is that after he's dead,
4599140	4602140	his body will be 100 tiny pieces of him.
4602140	4610140	Teddy White experiences some new sensations on a new hot in Cleveland.
4610140	4612140	We should go.
4612140	4614140	I'm going to go home and Google how we treat.
4614140	4617140	We treat our dad in so many, like, different weird ways.
4617140	4618140	That's really strange.
4618140	4619140	It's a huge thing.
4619140	4623140	It's like, yeah, what is our relationship with the,
4623140	4627140	they say that Cro-Magnon, which is what we are.
4627140	4628140	We're Cro-Magnon, right?
4628140	4632140	As opposed to Neanderthals, who we kind of out-hunted to extinction.
4632140	4635140	Although some people believe that we interbred with them.
4635140	4637140	But the Neanderthals,
4637140	4641140	in spite of being kind of a little dumber in different ways,
4641140	4644140	like, they couldn't invent, like, ranged weapons,
4644140	4646140	like, which we use to just hunt them to extinction.
4646140	4650140	But they, they buried their dead.
4650140	4653140	And they buried them with, like, trinkets and stuff,
4653140	4655140	which Cro-Magnons didn't do.
4655140	4658140	We are descended from more atheistic animals
4658140	4662140	than the brutes that we hunted,
4662140	4667140	we elbowed out of existence by being smart.
4667140	4669140	I don't know how to process that.
4669140	4671140	I just want to go fuck a dead old lady.
4671140	4675140	Well, I think, you know, you know how I feel about religion and all.
4675140	4679140	But I think the ritual of someone dying in the way you treat them
4679140	4682140	is, you know, that's how you sort of say goodbye to them.
4682140	4685140	And that's how you process your feelings of, you know, that this person is dead.
4685140	4688140	I feel like, I don't know, in our culture especially,
4688140	4690140	we don't really know how to do that.
4690140	4693140	When my mom, my mom died in our house,
4693140	4698140	she was dying and she died in our house in, like, the den.
4698140	4706140	And we just turned the lights off and waited for the, for the, the...
4706140	4707140	Corner?
4707140	4708140	Corner.
4708140	4710140	We waited for the corner and just went in the other room
4710140	4712140	and watched Muppet Treasure Island.
4712140	4715140	That's one way to do it.
4715140	4717140	You know, no wrong answers.
4717140	4720140	That's actually what the Quran says, didn't you?
4724140	4725140	Come here, come here.
4725140	4728140	No, that's the Muppet's Take Manhattan.
4728140	4733140	No, you have to watch a Tim Curry movie according to the Quran.
4733140	4737140	It has to be The Worst Witch or it has to be Muppet's Treasure Island.
4737140	4741140	We stood around her for a while and then we're like, oh, I,
4741140	4743140	I don't know what else to do.
4743140	4745140	And then we just turned off.
4745140	4746140	She died in the den.
4746140	4747140	She died in the den.
4747140	4749140	And you guys went, it's like,
4749140	4753140	how long has it been since you guys seen Muppet Treasure Island?
4753140	4755140	And so there's a corpse in the other room?
4755140	4757140	It's a mom.
4757140	4759140	It's not a corpse.
4759140	4761140	That used to be, that's another thing.
4761140	4763140	Like, our relationship with death has changed.
4763140	4765140	Like, it changed in modern society.
4765140	4768140	I mean, it wasn't a cool night.
4768140	4771140	It wasn't like, listen, tonight, bit of A, bit of B.
4771140	4777140	But I mean, when she died, we were all like, and now,
4777140	4779140	and we all kind of like spread.
4779140	4780140	How old were you?
4780140	4781140	17.
4781140	4784140	And you sort of knew that she was, that this was going to happen.
4784140	4785140	Yeah, she was, she was, she was dying.
4785140	4786140	It wasn't, it wasn't a sudden thing.
4786140	4788140	Like, she was in the hospital.
4788140	4789140	She had a couch.
4789140	4791140	She had a bed set up in the den.
4791140	4794140	It wasn't upstairs because she couldn't go up and down the stairs.
4794140	4796140	She was dying of ovarian cancer.
4796140	4797140	She died in the den.
4797140	4799140	We all kind of knew the day it was happening.
4799140	4801140	It happened.
4801140	4805140	And then we were all like, and, like, we had this grieving period
4805140	4807140	that was very intense.
4807140	4811140	And then we were all like, and now, you have homework.
4811140	4814140	And I have, I mean, it was, like, not a day.
4814140	4816140	It wasn't casual.
4816140	4818140	Like, I watched Muppet Treasure Island for a reason.
4818140	4819140	Right.
4819140	4820140	Because you want to.
4820140	4821140	I loved it.
4821140	4822140	And it was very comforting.
4822140	4823140	Yeah.
4823140	4827140	I guess when that happens, like, how do you process it when you go back to,
4827140	4828140	like, normal life?
4828140	4831140	And there is something to be said for, I think part of the reason that there's
4831140	4836140	so much ritual to it is that it gives you stuff to do after this horrible thing
4836140	4837140	has happened.
4837140	4840140	Now you have, like, preparations to make and you have to set up a funeral home
4840140	4841140	and all that stuff.
4841140	4848140	It felt very inappropriate when the doorbell rang and Tim Curry's singing
4848140	4849140	for cabin fever.
4849140	4851140	And I'm, fuck, I have to pause it.
4851140	4854140	She's here.
4854140	4855140	She's right over here.
4855140	4856140	Oh, my God.
4856140	4861140	That's, I mean, that's the amazing thing about death is that it's, it
4861140	4862140	intermingles with life.
4862140	4865140	Like, we don't, we do everything we can to not make it feel like that.
4865140	4870140	But when you talk to people who have had real experiences with, with real
4870140	4874140	encounters with death, of course, part of the story is going to be the seemingly
4874140	4882140	profane, absurdly braided experience of then I ordered a pizza and then a
4882140	4884140	friend came over and we played Yahtzee or whatever.
4884140	4890140	The, I saw that, remember that Penn Gillette had that show on Showtime and I
4890140	4891140	don't know.
4891140	4892140	Bullshit.
4892140	4893140	Yeah.
4893140	4897140	They were to the funeral industry in one episode and I was, I was interested to
4897140	4902140	learn from that show, if that show is credible, that, that we, the reason
4902140	4906140	they're called funeral parlors is because what you, what we now call living
4906140	4909140	rooms, we specifically made a decision.
4909140	4914140	Good housekeeping magazine, they cite as the, they made a sort of deliberate
4914140	4918140	decision the way Hearst newspapers decided to go after hemp.
4918140	4924140	Like, like, like we made a decision to go after death and that good housekeeping
4924140	4927140	magazine suddenly announced at a certain point during a certain year.
4927140	4931140	This is now called the living room because your house isn't for dead people.
4931140	4935140	You don't want dead people in your house because before that you had a parlor and
4935140	4939140	part of the parlor's function was that your relatives died and you, that's where
4939140	4944140	they stayed and everyone came over and paid their respects and took photos and
4944140	4945140	hung out.
4945140	4946140	And took photographs with them and whatnot.
4946140	4948140	And played parlor games, charades.
4948140	4950140	What about ice cream parlors?
4950140	4954140	That, great question.
4954140	4957140	Are you Rain Man?
4958140	4961140	Yeah, it came where it sucks.
4961140	4964140	It's like a child walked into the room.
4964140	4967140	What about ice cream parlors?
4967140	4970140	We had funeral parlors.
4970140	4972140	We had ice cream parlors.
4972140	4973140	He's mad.
4973140	4974140	He's mad.
4974140	4975140	Cream goes to that.
4975140	4977140	They took the ice cream out of our living rooms.
4977140	4982140	Yeah, when you got ice cream you would sit in a room for two days and take pictures with him.
4982140	4986140	I gotta go to somewhere else to eat my ice cream.
4987140	4990140	Bullshit.
4990140	4994140	I want to eat my ice cream in my living room with my dead nanny.
4994140	4998140	Nana and watch fucking Muppet Treasure Island like a fucking human being.
4998140	5001140	It's strange that we do such unnatural things too.
5001140	5008140	America has spearheaded the strange relationship with titties and dead people.
5008140	5010140	Titties and dead people.
5010140	5015140	You go to Italy, you turn on the TV and there would be one titty in a fucking commercial for
5015140	5016140	them.
5016140	5017140	Yogurt.
5017140	5018140	That would just be a lady.
5018140	5019140	That's a weird link.
5019140	5021140	They have like a one titty rule in Europe, right?
5021140	5027140	That's the one turning to Greg because he's cosmopolitan.
5027140	5029140	The rest don't kill people in Europe.
5029140	5032140	America's relationship with boobs, with nudity.
5032140	5035140	I remember Janet Jackson had to apologize and whatnot.
5035140	5038140	When I went to Paris I went underground and they have those catacombs.
5038140	5039140	I was amazed.
5039140	5041140	I was walking for what seemed like miles.
5041140	5043140	How was the ice cream?
5044140	5048140	They had dug just the material to build the city out of these tunnels and then put their
5048140	5050140	dead down there.
5050140	5053140	It was like, oh shit, there's nothing like this under New York.
5053140	5055140	There's nothing like this under Texas.
5055140	5056140	In Rome.
5056140	5057140	There's nothing.
5057140	5058140	We don't like death.
5058140	5059140	We don't like boobs.
5059140	5064140	In Rome, there's one order like monk or they're called the capuchin I think.
5064140	5065140	Have you been there?
5065140	5070140	You go into the basement and all their dead priests they use to decorate their place.
5070140	5076140	They've made these wonderful, amazing skulls there.
5076140	5078140	These awesome designs.
5078140	5080140	Looks like wings and stuff.
5080140	5084140	It feels like to me a lot healthier way of dealing with death.
5084140	5085140	For sure.
5085140	5086140	Looking at it.
5086140	5087140	Of course.
5087140	5088140	Dealing with it.
5088140	5090140	When they go to those places in Europe they're called an ossuary.
5090140	5091140	I remember going to one with my wife.
5091140	5092140	That's right, an ossuary.
5092140	5093140	Outside of Prague, yeah.
5093140	5097140	In skulls they had written Eche Mort, which means look at death.
5097140	5099140	It's just a wall of fucking skulls.
5099140	5102140	It's wildly morbid.
5102140	5107140	It could have just said Snickers is packed with peanuts.
5107140	5110140	Because you would be looking at death while they could have worked some monetization.
5110140	5114140	Let's try and fuck this in the ice cream parlor.
5114140	5116140	Now we're real uncomfortable with it.
5116140	5117140	I'm mad about ice cream parlors.
5117140	5118140	I don't know why.
5118140	5120140	America is a very young country.
5120140	5123140	It doesn't want to believe in death.
5123140	5125140	It doesn't want to believe in sex either.
5125140	5128140	It doesn't want to believe in violence.
5128140	5129140	We love violence.
5129140	5134140	But we don't understand fucking and dying yet.
5134140	5135140	You know, I'm just fine.
5135140	5139140	I'm not a happy Fourth of July by the way.
5139140	5140140	When I do believe...
5140140	5141140	Happy birthday America.
5141140	5146140	I don't know if we all believe in death, but I do believe in Dungeons and Dragons.
5146140	5149140	Let's get it on.
5149140	5151140	That was so...
5151140	5155140	You gotta give me a better cue than...
5155140	5158140	Or when we last time on Harmon Town.
5158140	5162140	Our heroes had barely escaped from paradise with their lives.
5162140	5167140	And after robbing a gnomish bar and fighting off the local gang, the cactus bunch,
5167140	5170140	the party set fire to the bar and exited.
5170140	5175140	Quark noticing the fire spreading went to warn the locals and alerted a gnome barber
5175140	5178140	who got in an argument with the barbarian before scuttling off.
5178140	5182140	Afraid of legal backlash, our heroes tried to escape the city
5182140	5185140	but found woven barriers blocking any egress.
5185140	5189140	Sharpie burnt a hole in the woven wall and with some of Kristoburg's acid
5189140	5194140	they tore their way through and into the cold tundra outside.
5194140	5195140	Outside.
5195140	5200140	There they found themselves completely lost with only a burning sack laying in the ice.
5200140	5205140	That is until Yeti came upon the gang, ignoring Quark's friendliness.
5205140	5208140	He threw a net on the gang.
5208140	5210140	But would they appreciate being in a net?
5210140	5212140	And was the Yeti gonna eat them?
5212140	5216140	Would Bill Mardigan simply burn to death and everyone in it?
5216140	5219140	Find out on an all-new Harmon Town.
5225140	5230140	Yeah, we escaped the city by burning our way through the wall after burning everything.
5230140	5233140	Then we're in a tundra, a Yeti came up through a net over us.
5233140	5235140	I don't know why I'm repeating that.
5235140	5237140	Yeah, well, for Greg, right?
5237140	5242140	We were at a wonderful place, everyone was nice to us, we burned everything and now we're...
5244140	5247140	And we've become just sociopaths, that's the game now.
5247140	5253140	Well, in the last two episodes I wasn't really myself and I really wanted that baby.
5254140	5256140	Do we have the robot golem baby?
5256140	5258140	Oh, you guys got it.
5258140	5259140	Okay, good.
5259140	5261140	But it doesn't have the life thing in it, right?
5261140	5267140	Greg, we're in procession of a small robotic golem baby that needs a certain disc to make it operate.
5267140	5269140	Oh, absolutely, enchanting.
5272140	5278140	So you guys, you're in the middle of this cold, you know, frozen wasteland sort of situation.
5278140	5282140	You're underneath a big Yeti net and there's a big Yeti looking at you guys.
5282140	5289140	He takes a few steps back after seeing you guys in the net and he grunts and he raises his hands like this.
5290140	5291140	Raise the roof?
5291140	5292140	Yeah.
5292140	5293140	He's raising the roof?
5293140	5294140	He's doing that, but that doesn't exist indeed.
5294140	5297140	I admit it, I emulate it.
5297140	5299140	You're into it, you guys are just doing it.
5299140	5301140	I go, I do it too.
5301140	5303140	We're your friends, we're your friends.
5303140	5305140	I go, whoop, whoop.
5305140	5307140	Those things all happen.
5307140	5311140	Just kind of like a weird miming thing going on, no one's really...
5312140	5315140	No communication is really happening.
5315140	5317140	Can I make eye contact with him?
5318140	5319140	Yeti!
5319140	5321140	Yeah, go ahead.
5321140	5323140	Yeti!
5323140	5325140	What's happening?
5327140	5329140	Who do...
5329140	5331140	Do I speak this language?
5331140	5332140	Is he stuttering?
5332140	5334140	Is he having a stroke or is this a language?
5334140	5335140	It's a language you don't understand.
5335140	5337140	He's speaking backwards, I think.
5337140	5338140	Say it again.
5338140	5340140	Eh, stuff.
5341140	5343140	He's saying futzty.
5344140	5347140	But the blinding snow and driving wind
5347140	5349140	give way to the sound of hoof prints.
5349140	5351140	I mean, hoof hoof sounds.
5351140	5352140	What's the...
5353140	5354140	Oh my God.
5355140	5356140	Oh my God.
5357140	5358140	Is that...
5359140	5360140	I made...
5360140	5362140	It's Tylenol with Cody!
5365140	5366140	Once again.
5367140	5372140	By the infinitesimal genitalia of Justin Bieber, I have arrived.
5373140	5375140	At a moment most propitious.
5376140	5378140	Oh foul Yeti.
5379140	5383140	Taste my vengeance upon thee as I allow...
5384140	5387140	One, I detect evil, and two...
5389140	5392140	I do something else that's poorly spelled.
5394140	5396140	Is it Tylenol with Cody?
5396140	5397140	Yeah.
5397140	5398140	It is I.
5398140	5402140	He who is both female and male, immortal and mortal,
5402140	5406140	horse and man, part Jew and part human.
5408140	5410140	Richard Simmons?
5411140	5414140	Like Suarez, I will bite you if you are Italian.
5417140	5419140	What is this Yeti I see before me?
5419140	5422140	Is this a Bigfoot in white garb?
5423140	5424140	It definitely is.
5424140	5429140	You use your magical evil-sensing horn to see if it's evil,
5429140	5431140	and you detect no evil in its heart.
5431140	5432140	Oh.
5435140	5436140	Indeed.
5436140	5438140	My horn is fallible.
5441140	5445140	Sometimes my horn misdiagnoses like Dick Van Dyke on the show.
5446140	5447140	Wow.
5447140	5450140	You're gonna update your references, Tylenol with Cody.
5453140	5455140	A pile of shit thou eateth.
5455140	5457140	My references will remain eternal.
5460140	5463140	You speak them with such confidence, there's no need to update.
5464140	5465140	Ta, ever so.
5466140	5468140	The host always been my favorite in secret.
5470140	5473140	There is no evil in this Yeti, and let me whisk you away,
5473140	5477140	all upon you, jump upon my back, and we shall fly,
5477140	5480140	like a duck's ass sliding down an icy hill backwards.
5481140	5482140	We're in a net.
5483140	5484140	We're in a net.
5484140	5490140	But before we go, the Yeti has hidden treasure that has not been spoken of,
5490140	5493140	for Yetis are known to keep upon their person,
5493140	5497140	and in a case about them, much, much, much riches.
5498140	5502140	I brandish my cutlass, and I slice through the net.
5504140	5507140	You slice into the net, but it's made out of steel.
5507140	5508140	Get up.
5509140	5511140	It hits the net and bounces off.
5511140	5515140	Tylenol with Cody, do you know this Yeti, or is this a new Yeti to you?
5516140	5519140	Indeed, all Yetis are but one and the same.
5519140	5522140	If thou hast met one, thou hast met them all.
5522140	5523140	Racist?
5523140	5525140	That sounds very racist.
5526140	5527140	I am eternal.
5527140	5529140	These are truths that I speak of.
5530140	5535140	Not bromides and platitudes, saws, and well-worn tropes.
5535140	5541140	These are but things from experience, pluck it I have, from my passage to past.
5544140	5546140	I don't know if that answered my question.
5547140	5551140	Indeed, thou hast much treasure, dost thou not Yeti,
5551140	5554140	keeping in thy case that thou keeps behind thee.
5555140	5558140	It grunts at you, and you can understand what it's saying.
5558140	5560140	Of course I can, I'm polyglot.
5561140	5562140	Says it on page two.
5563140	5566140	It says, my chest is back at my house.
5567140	5569140	Fuck all day and fuck my luck.
5571140	5576140	Many riches were I to grab this day, but it seems that the Yeti has none upon him.
5576140	5578140	Hast thou any credit cards?
5579140	5580140	What's a credit card?
5581140	5583140	Jesus H, you fucking hillbilly.
5584140	5587140	Can you get the Yeti to remove the net, let us out of the net?
5587140	5588140	And ask him what's happening?
5588140	5595140	Indeed, Yeti, free my friends, wouldst thou, for thou'st is listening to thine equine master.
5598140	5600140	He says, oh, oh, these guys are your friends.
5600140	5602140	I thought they were just animals.
5602140	5603140	Let me get that for you.
5604140	5605140	Racists, racists.
5605140	5608140	They are but comedians who live in Los Angeles.
5609140	5614140	Animals thou art not, but with William Morris endeavor, dost thou sign.
5615140	5616140	I wish.
5617140	5618140	Wow.
5618140	5621140	Or other smaller agencies that are more boutique.
5622140	5623140	The endeavors.
5624140	5625140	The endeavors and the APA's.
5625140	5626140	And the cause.
5626140	5627140	Or the UTAs.
5627140	5628140	Or the UTAs.
5628140	5629140	If anybody's out there.
5631140	5634140	Please spread it, thine Yeti.
5634140	5635140	He does so.
5635140	5636140	He removes the net.
5636140	5637140	A solid thou'st would do me.
5637140	5638140	He puts it away.
5640140	5642140	Sorry about that, he says.
5642140	5643140	Do we understand him?
5643140	5644140	We don't understand him.
5644140	5645140	No.
5645140	5646140	I understand him.
5646140	5648140	He's wished us most apologies.
5648140	5651140	Now let us away to our next adventure.
5651140	5653140	Coco I have made in a cavern nearby.
5654140	5655140	Oh.
5655140	5656140	Oh, okay.
5658140	5667140	I've taken me before the Yeti and like kind of indicate my...
5668140	5669140	Subservience?
5669140	5670140	Yeah.
5671140	5673140	Are you swearing fealty to the Yeti?
5673140	5674140	Yeah.
5674140	5675140	He removed the net, right?
5675140	5677140	So I'm like, I kneel before him.
5677140	5678140	Yeah.
5678140	5684140	Like a strong but servile man.
5686140	5687140	Okay.
5687140	5692140	And I just gesture to him because I know he can't speak English.
5693140	5695140	And I give him a thumbs up.
5697140	5700140	That's because we watched that Roger Ebert documentary.
5700140	5701140	So sad.
5701140	5703140	He keeps giving everything a thumbs up.
5705140	5706140	Well, he does.
5707140	5708140	He really did.
5708140	5711140	At the end he was very forgiving to a lot of terrible movies.
5711140	5712140	Yeah.
5713140	5714140	Right at the end.
5714140	5715140	Right at the end.
5715140	5716140	He's like, Monster House is great.
5720140	5721140	Tell it all with Cody.
5721140	5723140	How is Coco?
5724140	5726140	I haven't seen her in a while.
5726140	5729140	She is most delicious and chocolatey most.
5730140	5731140	Let us away.
5731140	5732140	Whoa.
5732140	5733140	And let our feet break wind.
5733140	5734140	Okay.
5734140	5736140	As we travel across this Pampas.
5737140	5740140	I ask Tylenol with Cody.
5740140	5741140	Oh, gnome.
5741140	5742140	Tis thee.
5742140	5744140	To whose face I have sat upon in the past.
5745140	5746140	He remembers.
5746140	5748140	Oh, most tranquil gnome.
5749140	5753140	My thighs have sought analgesia on my nose.
5754140	5756140	He never forgets a face.
5757140	5758140	Yep.
5758140	5760140	He never forgets a feeling.
5760140	5762140	Not once he sat on it.
5763140	5767140	Tylenol, can you ask us if we need a place, or maybe you know,
5767140	5769140	we need a place to get out of this cold.
5769140	5771140	Well, he's got a cavern with Coco.
5771140	5772140	He does.
5772140	5773140	A to the fucking.
5775140	5777140	Shall I ask most of the Bigfoot.
5781140	5783140	Bigfoot slang speaketh style.
5783140	5785140	That felt very racist.
5787140	5789140	Raised on the streets were I.
5791140	5794140	Cracked and I smokeeth with the Yeti and his Bigfoot friends.
5794140	5797140	He actually gets a, he's like the John Mayer of.
5797140	5799140	He gets to use the Y word and everything.
5802140	5803140	Like John Mayer am I.
5803140	5805140	Except without the bag of douche.
5805140	5807140	He's got a Yeti pass.
5807140	5808140	Yeah.
5808140	5809140	Indeed.
5809140	5811140	Thou Yeti pass I have bought.
5811140	5812140	Indeed.
5812140	5813140	Let's go to the cavern, right?
5813140	5815140	To the cavern with Coco.
5815140	5818140	Well, I hop on, I hop on Tylenol's back
5818140	5821140	and then grab a, grab a handful of Maine.
5821140	5822140	You do that.
5823140	5825140	Thine size are so strong, Gennone.
5826140	5828140	I have misty upon my hunches.
5830140	5833140	If I can, I'm going to snow ski behind Tylenol.
5833140	5836140	Is there room for me on there or my cock blocking?
5836140	5837140	Indeed.
5837140	5840140	Room for allest, most small foul man.
5840140	5842140	Everybody, hop aboard Cody.
5842140	5843140	Rigging an outfit on there?
5843140	5844140	But you're, you're snow skiing.
5844140	5845140	Yeah, I'm snow skiing behind.
5845140	5846140	Yeah.
5846140	5849140	Also, a cool hat possesseth I.
5849140	5850140	Cool hat?
5850140	5853140	It says so on the goddamn paper.
5854140	5855140	Jumpeth in.
5855140	5857140	It really does say a cool hat.
5857140	5858140	Cool hat.
5858140	5860140	To the honeycomb hideout.
5860140	5862140	The honeycomb kids are there.
5862140	5863140	I guess.
5863140	5864140	I guess.
5864140	5869140	So together you ride off and you ride towards what you couldn't even see before,
5869140	5873140	but once you get upon it, it's like a little white smear on a beer white smear
5873140	5875140	and it's a ice cavern.
5875140	5879140	It just goes in just a ways to get out of the wind and the snow.
5879140	5880140	Sounds like a biopsy.
5880140	5884140	It's kind of like a biopsy, but in the snow.
5885140	5889140	It's just some sort of ice cavern and you guys get there.
5891140	5892140	Whoa!
5892140	5897140	Seek at the shelter from the, the, the, the, the, the, the sleet and hail
5897140	5900140	in this cavern most warm, albeit shallow.
5901140	5907140	I, I, I spur Tylenol on into the cavern.
5907140	5910140	The interior of this cavern is not commodious.
5910140	5915140	Thou'st will find that mine four haunches are most snowpiferous.
5915140	5918140	Another shit I made up.
5919140	5921140	Wouldst thou like some cocoa?
5921140	5925140	It has the marshmallows in it, the kind that floated upon the top most pleasingly.
5925140	5927140	Yeah, I'll love some. Thank you.
5927140	5930140	Wouldst thou like toast with cinnamon on it?
5930140	5931140	Yeah.
5931140	5935140	For magic powers have I, and an amulet of shadow-worlding.
5935140	5938140	I'll just take the cinnamon toast and the...
5940140	5942140	Who would like a strawberry Pop-Tart?
5942140	5946140	Ooh, could I, can I trade my cinnamon toast for the strawberry Pop-Tart?
5946140	5948140	Abso-fucking-lutely, bro-hame.
5948140	5950140	I don't want the crust there because that shit nasty.
5950140	5954140	I put butter upon the cinnamon Pop-Tart to make it extra good.
5954140	5956140	Do you have pickles?
5956140	5957140	Dude.
5957140	5959140	Are you pregnant?
5959140	5961140	I have corny shell in the small French con.
5961140	5964140	They're most sexy, and they have pearl onions amongst them.
5964140	5966140	I'll try one.
5966140	5968140	Try this and see if it does not crunch its most.
5968140	5970140	I try the pickle.
5970140	5974140	Game Master, I check in emotionally with cocoa.
5974140	5977140	Um, she's kind of distant.
5977140	5978140	Hey!
5978140	5980140	Who wouldn't be in a shadow ice cave?
5980140	5982140	Who's, uh, who's cocoa?
5982140	5983140	That's, uh, Mulrain's horse.
5983140	5984140	Of course, yes.
5985140	5987140	Should there be a voice to cocoa?
5987140	5988140	I mean, there doesn't need to be.
5988140	5989140	I mean...
5989140	5990140	She's not there.
5990140	5992140	She doesn't speak, right?
5992140	5995140	I mean, I've heard, I've heard her speak.
5996140	5998140	You know, is, is cocoa with us or no?
5998140	5999140	Yeah, she's here.
5999140	6000140	Oh, okay.
6000140	6001140	She usually is.
6001140	6002140	Cocoa.
6002140	6003140	Cocoa.
6003140	6004140	I present a carrot.
6004140	6005140	Cocoa, baby.
6006140	6007140	Um...
6011140	6014140	Much Vitamin A has transferred this evening.
6015140	6020140	I, I feel like I kind of abandoned you a while ago.
6020140	6022140	I mean, you're a horse you're hard to take with,
6022140	6024140	and I know a lot of stuff has happened to you.
6024140	6025140	Uh-huh.
6029140	6031140	Cocoa, cocoa does seem emotional.
6032140	6036140	By the blister genitalia of Miley Cyrus, this doth bog down.
6040140	6042140	Speaketh not to thine horse, for I am a unicorn,
6042140	6045140	and more than horse am I, for horn do I have in my head.
6046140	6047140	Oh, don't be jealous.
6047140	6051140	That's not a competition just because you, you're kind of horsey.
6052140	6054140	Settle thine shit down, o sprog.
6056140	6057140	I examine the cavern.
6057140	6058140	It's very shallow.
6058140	6062140	It's pretty nondescript, other than like what looks like a small burnt out farm.
6062140	6066140	A throw rug have I bought from bed, bathroom, and beyond.
6067140	6071140	So, Tylenol, you just, you, you, you live here?
6072140	6073140	I don't live.
6073140	6074140	I crib.
6076140	6079140	And then other times I, you know, I crib with other people.
6079140	6081140	I get around town.
6081140	6083140	Do you know the neighborhood well?
6083140	6084140	Like, where are we?
6084140	6085140	Do I fuck?
6085140	6086140	Jesus.
6088140	6092140	Home style is this to me, although the winner is most foul and pestilent.
6093140	6098140	Much snow and abrasive ice crystals formeth about us.
6098140	6102140	I make a terrible pun and I go, I mean, I've heard the phrase man cave, but,
6102140	6106140	and everyone looks at me horribly and then I retreat back into my cup of cocoa.
6108140	6110140	Thou has nothing to be ashamed of.
6110140	6112140	Lead us out of here, I will.
6112140	6115140	On to the furtive plain and then on to the fruitful area
6115140	6118140	where the purple caverns do beckon us.
6118140	6124140	Full of riches and stew made of rabbits and other things that thou likest.
6124140	6126140	Tylenol or Cody, what have you been up to?
6126140	6129140	I'm high, a good deal of the time.
6130140	6134140	We haven't seen you in a long time and now you're very set on this goal.
6135140	6137140	Just tell us about of your travels.
6137140	6139140	Oh, many travels have I.
6139140	6141140	Omaha, Nebraska have I been to.
6141140	6144140	And found that the white people were fat most.
6144140	6149140	Fanny packs and crocs did they wear in public and no sport coat upon thee.
6149140	6154140	And then other times have I gone to Missouri and found that the people ate pork rinds
6154140	6159140	unashamedly and listened to country music as if it was for everyone and not just the white.
6162140	6166140	Lady Anabelum have I heard and much barf have I spewed.
6168140	6170140	Oh, my travels.
6171140	6175140	To Paris I have been and under the catacombs did I go.
6175140	6179140	And there did I see those who were dead and the ossuary therein lie.
6179140	6183140	And yet cometh back to this land I have because treasured most isn't B.
6183140	6185140	Take us to this treasure town when I was coding.
6185140	6186140	Such an A will I.
6186140	6188140	I like these purple caverns there.
6188140	6191140	I like the sound of these purple caverns.
6191140	6195140	The caverns are not only purple, they're also violet and other shades of vermilion.
6195140	6197140	What sort of treasures lay within?
6197140	6201140	The kind that will knock the socks off of thee should thou swear a socks.
6205140	6210140	That plentiful and plenitude shall you see the shining treasures that lie within me.
6210140	6213140	Let's all have a poor talent and be whisked away to the purple caverns as a treasure.
6213140	6218140	Thou nost even have to jump upon my back for here we are transported I.
6218140	6219140	What?
6221140	6222140	You transported us?
6222140	6227140	Yeah I have an amulet of shadow worlding and I have streamers.
6229140	6231140	Is that like herpes?
6232140	6234140	He's reclaiming herpes.
6235140	6236140	Streamers.
6236140	6238140	Are you going to decorate a prom?
6239140	6241140	Many proms have I decorated.
6242140	6246140	So wait do you want to activate the amulet or do you want to travel to the purple canyon?
6246140	6248140	To the purple canyon which do I travel?
6248140	6250140	Is the Yeti with us?
6250140	6251140	No no.
6251140	6252140	He didn't come with you to the cave.
6252140	6255140	The major bummer is he and leaveth behind shall we not?
6255140	6258140	That's the most confused Yeti in the history of Yetidim.
6259140	6262140	I mount Coco and take her with us.
6262140	6265140	What's thou mount Coco in front of me with video rolling?
6268140	6272140	So you depart, you head towards the purple canyons.
6272140	6278140	You're pretty deep into this icy tundra wasteland so the journey takes several weeks but alas
6279140	6285140	you find yourself at the purple mountain range where the purple caverns are said to be found.
6286140	6287140	Weeks have gone by?
6287140	6288140	Oh yeah.
6288140	6289140	What did we do for these weeks?
6289140	6290140	Travel.
6290140	6291140	Peenuckle.
6292140	6294140	And other games like cribbage.
6295140	6296140	And old maid.
6299140	6304140	A priest has asked me to sit upon his lap and whiskey has he asked me to drink.
6304140	6307140	And yet I have refused him twice upon trips to the toilet.
6309140	6310140	Tylenol.
6310140	6312140	We're here at the purple canyons.
6312140	6314140	Hooray hurrah.
6314140	6316140	And the purple canyons doth yawn before thee.
6316140	6318140	Dost thou not see the riches lay within?
6318140	6321140	And the golden light that doth beam above thee?
6321140	6325140	Did the treasure just lay there for us to pick them like fruit hanging from a tree?
6325140	6331140	Indeed thou art most broke and of thine horrible plight I have heard in my immortal world.
6331140	6337140	Thou hast been burning villages to the ground like sociopaths weeks past.
6338140	6344140	Riches I would transport to thee so that thou may have a couple of fucking nickels to rub together as this journey prevails.
6344140	6346140	I don't see any treasures here though.
6346140	6347140	Where do we have to go?
6347140	6352140	There are none so blind, Gennelm, as those who will not open thine hall.
6352140	6354140	Don't get fucking weird, Tylenol.
6355140	6358140	For fucking six weeks we've been fucking riding around with snow.
6359140	6361140	And you're fucking so high.
6362140	6365140	I've been hearing the same song over and over again.
6365140	6368140	I've heard you keep repeating these stories.
6369140	6371140	I don't even know to believe you anymore, man.
6372140	6375140	I got saddle sores like you fucking never seen.
6376140	6378140	An option thou hast better than I?
6378140	6380140	Show me these treasures, motherfucker.
6380140	6383140	Stare forward to know.
6383140	6385140	You're talking about these treasures.
6385140	6387140	With thine jaundiced eye.
6387140	6389140	Jesus Christ.
6389140	6393140	Stare forward into the abyss and see what thou cannot know.
6393140	6396140	I'm looking at a canyon.
6396140	6399140	Does no one have a fucking flashlight in this crew?
6400140	6402140	I light a torch.
6402140	6406140	You light a torch and you can see inside the opening of this purple cavern.
6406140	6414140	There's three or four, I'd say four gemstones of various colors just kind of seated upon the floor.
6414140	6416140	I ride towards the biggest one.
6417140	6419140	Dude, these aren't worth anything.
6420140	6423140	Knowest nothing, thy.
6423140	6428140	For these gemstones are valuable most in a way thou canst understand.
6428140	6433140	Well, then why would you want us to have them if we can't understand?
6434140	6437140	Thine mind cannot rot around at this moment.
6437140	6441140	But moments hence, thou'st will be in most possession of understanding.
6442140	6443140	Crew.
6443140	6444140	Crew.
6444140	6446140	A stick bug boys or whatever.
6446140	6451140	This is like taking a fan full of retards to Knott's Berry Farm.
6452140	6453140	Gentlemen.
6453140	6454140	In patience though.
6454140	6457140	Nobody knows what you're talking about, man.
6458140	6459140	What the fuck?
6459140	6462140	What is Knott's Berry Farm and what is the R word you said?
6463140	6465140	Is that a new form of orc?
6466140	6467140	Yeah.
6468140	6469140	Wait, how is that?
6474140	6475140	I'm high-roading.
6477140	6479140	Yeah, we're high-roading.
6479140	6481140	I appraise the gems.
6481140	6486140	As you guys approach the gems, they seem to shift before your eyes and mutate
6486140	6491140	and they get bigger and grow into strange, grotesque, insectoid forms.
6491140	6492140	Fuck.
6492140	6494140	Tylenol, you son of a bitch.
6494140	6495140	Hey.
6495140	6496140	This is the treasure?
6496140	6497140	Fuck is thou'st.
6497140	6498140	Does that make sense to you?
6500140	6503140	For a moment, I lend Christopher's ear.
6503140	6505140	What is going on?
6507140	6508140	What are we...
6508140	6509140	I'm over here.
6509140	6510140	Tylenol, fuck it.
6510140	6511140	We broke for six weeks.
6511140	6514140	I feel like it's our fault for following these gems.
6514140	6518140	By the way, that cocoa was just a bunch of mud and water.
6519140	6520140	That's what Swiss missed.
6520140	6522140	I was being polite.
6522140	6525140	This guy got us out of a yeti net, all right?
6525140	6527140	He got us out of a yeti net.
6527140	6528140	Hooray.
6528140	6530140	We didn't try other means.
6530140	6532140	Hey, I have a great plan.
6532140	6534140	We burned down the purple cavern.
6537140	6539140	Jack and apes.
6539140	6541140	I go to our cocos and cocoa.
6541140	6544140	I don't know if you've noticed, but these treasures you're talking about,
6544140	6546140	these gems that you were so smug about a moment ago?
6546140	6547140	Not cocoa.
6547140	6548140	I'm sorry.
6548140	6549140	You're allowed to talk to her.
6549140	6550140	I'm sorry.
6550140	6551140	I meant Tylenol.
6551140	6552140	Tylenol with Cody.
6552140	6555140	Tylenol with Cody and Jack.
6555140	6558140	These gems turned into giant insectoid creatures.
6558140	6560140	Is this the treasure you told us about?
6560140	6565140	Thou has not seen the intrinsic value herein.
6565140	6567140	Show me the value of this.
6567140	6569140	I have a...
6571140	6573140	So, so high.
6573140	6574140	What are the bugs doing?
6574140	6576140	Yeah, what do they do, Spence?
6576140	6580140	They're slowly menacing towards you, clacking their dangerous limbs.
6580140	6582140	Menacing is a verb?
6582140	6583140	It is now.
6583140	6585140	Well, yeah, yeah, menacing is a verb.
6585140	6586140	What happened in my magic?
6586140	6588140	They're eviling towards us.
6591140	6593140	Menacing actually is a verb.
6593140	6594140	It's a gerund.
6594140	6596140	You can menace someone.
6596140	6598140	I mean, I'm not saying I did all right, but it's definitely...
6598140	6599140	What happened to my magical powers?
6599140	6602140	I brought them for jewels, and all of a sudden there's menacing inside.
6602140	6603140	Yeah, yeah, Tylenol.
6603140	6605140	They're not evil, so...
6605140	6606140	They're not?
6606140	6608140	All right, everybody, a chilafed takest.
6608140	6612140	Why don't you do evil the way you read their heart
6612140	6614140	and see if there's any good or evil in their heart?
6614140	6616140	Detect evil on them, Tylenol.
6616140	6617140	Excellent idea.
6617140	6620140	I shall take thee under advisement.
6620140	6621140	You trotted forward, shall I?
6621140	6623140	Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
6623140	6624140	They don't seem evil.
6624140	6628140	They just seem kind of like empty, like robots or dolls or something.
6628140	6632140	Mmm, disappointing this, like a 70s TV show.
6633140	6634140	What are you talking about?
6634140	6637140	Much value thought I had these insectoids.
6637140	6639140	Let's talk more rock, motherfucker.
6639140	6642140	I use my armulet of spring.
6642140	6643140	Armulet?
6643140	6646140	Yeah, it's an armulet, yeah.
6646140	6648140	You really got him.
6648140	6652140	Can shoot thorny vines 20 feet to protect or ensnare enemies.
6652140	6654140	I choose not to protect them.
6654140	6656140	I would like to ensnare them.
6656140	6658140	They're not evil.
6658140	6659140	They're not evil.
6659140	6660140	They're not evil.
6660140	6662140	Oh, wait, you found that out?
6662140	6664140	Yeah, he said they're not evil.
6664140	6665140	Oh, sorry, I'm drunk.
6665140	6667140	Well, they don't have evil hearts.
6667140	6670140	You know, ovens aren't evil, but if you stick your head in it, it'll kill you.
6670140	6674140	Yeah, like a bobcat isn't evil, but it'll eat your children on a camping trip.
6674140	6676140	The dingoes that took that lady's babies.
6676140	6677140	You're right.
6677140	6678140	They weren't snidely whiplash.
6678140	6680140	They were like, I want to eat a baby.
6680140	6681140	I'm a dingo.
6681140	6682140	You're right.
6682140	6683140	Let's set them on fire.
6683140	6684140	Ruined her life.
6684140	6687140	How many mundane points do you mortals make?
6687140	6690140	I sense motive on these insectoid gems.
6690140	6691140	You have no motive.
6691140	6693140	They're just evil.
6693140	6697140	I'm about to fucking take a sword to these fuckers and see if there's any gold inside them.
6697140	6699140	You can't detect any motive.
6699140	6700140	I take my sword and I cook it.
6700140	6701140	Oh, yeah.
6701140	6703140	I fucking just smash one in the face.
6703140	6704140	Oh, Jesus.
6704140	6707140	You smash one in the face.
6707140	6710140	It's dealing 19 damage.
6710140	6715140	It shatters into crystals.
6715140	6716140	All right.
6716140	6721140	Can I just keep smashing or am I going to roll over here?
6721140	6722140	All right.
6722140	6724140	You have a boner, don't you?
6724140	6725140	Nope.
6725140	6727140	Keep talking, I'm going to.
6727140	6731140	You slash into the rest of these guys, but they're not having it.
6731140	6732140	Oh, yeah?
6732140	6733140	No, it's bouncing off.
6733140	6735140	What do these crystals look like?
6735140	6736140	They look like crabs.
6736140	6739140	One of them looks like a red crab made of ruby.
6739140	6742140	Ah, much crab meat have we discovered most expensive as.
6742140	6746140	Tylenol, take five, motherfucker.
6746140	6750140	The disappointment anticipate I did not.
6750140	6754140	I want to do my armulate and snare move now that the fighting is starting.
6754140	6755140	Well, I already rolled that.
6755140	6757140	So the other two are ensnared.
6757140	6758140	Oh, nice.
6758140	6759140	Their legs are all.
6759140	6762140	I look back from my ensnaring and I'm like, I look over at Mulray and I'm like,
6762140	6763140	huh?
6763140	6768140	And I'm like, yeah.
6768140	6772140	I have a magic circle that I can do against evil.
6772140	6775140	Not evil.
6775140	6779140	Who was that?
6779140	6783140	Much Asperger sensei.
6783140	6786140	There's a lot of it here.
6786140	6788140	All right, then I have some rope.
6788140	6789140	Yeah.
6789140	6796140	I'd like to do some tricks now to distract everyone from how shit the plot has become.
6796140	6799140	This one's called the triple helix.
6799140	6800140	It's really impressive.
6800140	6802140	You don't even have thumbs or anything.
6802140	6803140	Nope.
6803140	6809140	Puffs and yet knots I do wend.
6809140	6811140	Is there any value?
6811140	6813140	These ruby crystals?
6813140	6814140	Yeah.
6814140	6818140	Because I will say, if you had said, let's go six weeks, I'll show you some rope tricks.
6818140	6820140	None of us would have come.
6820140	6823140	Imagine my disappointment.
6823140	6825140	We were in a yeti net.
6825140	6826140	All right.
6826140	6827140	Yeah.
6827140	6828140	What are we doing?
6828140	6829140	This guy's Giuliani.
6829140	6830140	Take what you get.
6830140	6833140	We don't give him six weeks of our lives for getting us out of a fucking...
6833140	6836140	It wasn't six weeks, it was several weeks.
6836140	6841140	I lie on the ground and I open my clothes so the jewels will crawl in.
6841140	6842140	Wait, what?
6842140	6843140	Well, they're...
6843140	6847140	It was not the first time.
6847140	6850140	They're all entangled so they can't move good.
6850140	6851140	Okay.
6851140	6852140	Or well.
6852140	6857140	I shamefully button up my dress and I stand up and I just back up.
6857140	6859140	So what about the one that I shattered?
6859140	6860140	It's all shattered.
6860140	6861140	I mean...
6861140	6862140	Don't pat yourself on the back.
6862140	6863140	Can I get the red one?
6863140	6865140	Can I go with the red ruby?
6865140	6866140	And do what?
6866140	6867140	Find out what's happening.
6867140	6868140	Yeah.
6868140	6869140	Okay.
6869140	6872140	So you pick up a lot of sapphire shards.
6872140	6873140	I get a bunch.
6873140	6875140	I get the red one, the one that's really cool.
6875140	6876140	That one's not dead yet.
6876140	6878140	That's still in a thing.
6878140	6880140	Are there any red shattered ones?
6880140	6881140	No.
6881140	6883140	There's a red intact crab.
6883140	6888140	Red's my favorite color so I think we...
