0	10000	It's been a long day and I'm shaking again
10000	13000	It's been a long day and I'm shaking again
13000	16000	It's been a long day and I'm shaking again
16000	19000	I'm shaking again
19000	21000	My heart is burning down
21000	23000	I need you
23000	25000	I need you
25000	27000	I need you
27000	29000	I need you
29000	31000	I'm the mayor of Hermit Town, Dan Hermit!
31000	33000	I need you
33000	35000	I need you
35000	37000	I need you
37000	39000	I need you
39000	41000	I need you
41000	45000	All right, is the four-year-old gone?
45000	48000	What did I miss last week, Dan?
48000	50000	A four-year-old.
50000	53000	And so here's the thing about parenting.
53000	56000	Just don't involve me.
57000	59000	Do it from the back of the room
59000	62000	because as Spencer points out, little kids, they need to pee and poop.
62000	66000	They got tiny bladders at sub-point A1.
66000	71000	There's many, many points we could go into, but just bladders alone...
71000	76000	I thought you knew way more than you're supposed to about pre-pubescent digestive systems.
76000	78000	Let me tell you about...
78000	81000	At C-point A1, you're at chiropractor zeroing.
81000	86000	At C-point A2, that's where their bladders really just explode in size.
86000	88000	I have a question.
88000	91000	I was just listening to an audio yesterday in my car.
91000	94000	When she sat back down, did she start crying?
94000	97000	Well, she started crying before she sat back down.
97000	101000	We hooked her on that fucking Hollywood stage magic, man.
101000	103000	She's got a taste of it.
103000	105000	She's got nothing to compare it to.
105000	107000	We created a child star.
107000	109000	But when you gave her a chance...
110000	114000	When she had a chance to speak, she was like, nah.
114000	116000	She was being a Refusenik.
116000	118000	Then she got back in her seat and she cried.
118000	120000	She was like, I fucking blew my chance.
122000	126000	But honestly, she just cried because she was sitting up on stage and she liked it.
126000	128000	I know exactly how that feels.
128000	130000	I would love to not...
130000	134000	I was the little kid in his pajamas that would come out in the living room.
134000	136000	I'm sure it's Los Angeles.
136000	139000	It's probably half of the audience or more.
139000	141000	It was the kid in the family.
141000	143000	It was like, look at me, look at me.
143000	145000	It feels good when strangers pay attention to you.
145000	148000	Because you know that while they're doing it, your parents can't hit you.
150000	152000	It's safe.
152000	155000	It's like that moment in Texas Chainsaw Massacre when you're flagging down the cop car.
155000	157000	It's like nothing bad can happen now.
157000	159000	Oh, it's the cop that makes chili out of people.
159000	163000	Also, second question, how old is Tamura?
163000	165000	Tamura is 16.
166000	171000	I was trying to visualize him because I can't afford this subscription to our show.
171000	173000	Yeah, I love my neighbors.
173000	175000	The Bootsons, of course, they humanize me.
175000	178000	Of course, I'm all caught up in the Hollywood lifestyle.
178000	179000	I'm a cynical person.
179000	180000	I'm a Capricorn.
180000	181000	I'm hierarchical.
181000	183000	I'm patriarchal.
183000	184000	I'm self-loathing.
184000	186000	I don't smell the roses.
186000	189000	I don't notice avocado trees or eucalyptus.
189000	192000	She makes me muffins.
192000	194000	Oh, your life is happening right under your nose.
194000	197000	Oh, and she comes on the podcast and everybody loves her.
197000	199000	She wrote a poem for a dead eucalyptus tree.
199000	202000	She represents like, you know, like, oh, this is real life, man.
202000	204000	It's fucking God is in the moment.
204000	206000	You know, you're living in the past in the future.
206000	208000	You got to keep it real like your neighbor.
208000	211000	And then, like, I was like, thank you so much for doing the show.
211000	212000	People love you.
212000	213000	You should come back any time.
213000	214000	And she was like, thanks.
214000	216000	I have two screenplays for you to read.
220000	223000	So I didn't have it that wrong.
224000	228000	And her son makes horror mazes for a living now, right?
228000	229000	Like, that's a weirdo.
229000	230000	I think that's pretty interesting.
230000	232000	I like to check back in with him.
232000	233000	I want to go to...
233000	236000	Because a teenager has a notoriously small attention span.
236000	237000	Like, you're not supposed to...
237000	239000	If you get into something when you're like 12,
239000	242000	and you're still into it when you're 16,
242000	244000	it makes you neither a hero nor a villain,
244000	246000	but it makes you noteworthy.
246000	247000	I want to check in with that guy.
247000	249000	Have you ever gone through one of these horror mazes
249000	251000	or you just heard them from across the fence?
251000	252000	I only hear whatever he plays on a loop.
252000	255000	It's about a 30-second loop that goes for about a month and a half.
258000	261000	On a scale of 1 to 10, just by guessing from meeting him
261000	265000	and hearing the sounds, how spooktacular do you think they are?
266000	267000	I don't know.
267000	271000	I have to imagine a cheap haunted house is a scarier haunted house.
271000	273000	You've got less restrictions.
273000	276000	I've been on the Batman ride and the American Eagle
276000	278000	at Six Flags Great America in Illinois.
278000	280000	The Batman ride, they strap you in.
280000	282000	I've used this as a metaphor for things.
282000	286000	There's something less scary about having control totally taken from you
286000	288000	by a corporation.
288000	290000	It's like, oh, you're strapped in.
290000	293000	Worst case scenario is this thing just kind of explodes
293000	294000	and it's no one's fault.
294000	296000	But when you go on the American Eagle,
296000	299000	the world's oldest roller coaster,
299000	301000	which is just part of the psychological...
301000	302000	This is just a mind fuck.
302000	304000	It's the world's oldest roller coaster.
304000	305000	You're like, what?
305000	308000	It's made out of driftwood.
308000	310000	That washed over from Coney Island
310000	313000	that was already used for a worse roller coaster that fell apart
313000	315000	and then floated over and found its way to the Great Lakes.
315000	317000	They built a roller coaster out of it
317000	320000	and they strap a little jump rope across your lap
320000	322000	and ask you to hold it real tight.
322000	326000	The reason that's terrifying is because
326000	329000	you can't let go of your sense of accountability.
329000	333000	Terror, and I think this maybe could be thematic to our guests tonight.
333000	335000	I think a big part of terror is
335000	339000	how are you supposed to know when you're really in trouble
339000	341000	and can you see death coming?
341000	343000	And if you do, what are you supposed to do?
343000	346000	Like if a roller coaster starts to go wobbly,
346000	351000	is it going to be my fault if I die because I didn't blah, blah, blah?
351000	354000	Are the people going to be watching me on a 4chan video,
354000	356000	like watching my head fly and going like,
356000	362000	look at the dick in the back, doesn't even move?
362000	364000	I think it's certainly not your responsibility
364000	365000	once that thing gets rolling.
365000	367000	That's what my therapist would say.
367000	371000	That's probably not what the theme park people would say.
371000	375000	If you can blame a kid for getting eaten by a fucking alligator at Disneyland,
375000	381000	Jesus Christ, the ghost of that kid was more vilified than Richard Nixon
381000	385000	because God forbid a fucking corporation admit
385000	388000	they had anything to do with a fucking alligator.
388000	391000	Fucking, fucking, fuck, fuck you.
391000	394000	It's so fucking, and it's not Disney that I'm mad at.
394000	396000	Disney is a system.
396000	402000	Its job is to not have a heart or a brain or a soul.
402000	404000	Its job is to fucking keep existing.
404000	409000	We have systems like that in place, like the alphabet and medicine.
409000	414000	We're very glad it aren't only continued by someone's passion every day.
414000	419000	So, yeah, of course a fucking feelingless system should just keep going.
419000	422000	But that's why we have to be on our shit, you know?
422000	423000	Just to have a thing.
423000	425000	Maybe we could make a new law that says you don't have to,
425000	429000	it doesn't open you, it's not admissible in court if you say sorry about the alligator.
429000	432000	Shh.
432000	435000	If the president has to visit a flood, you know,
435000	439000	otherwise he gets yelled at, like, you don't care about no flood?
439000	444000	Well, somebody visit the fucking, somebody...
445000	448000	Just say you're sorry, kid, I'm sorry.
448000	449000	What, what?
449000	450000	He said don't go over there.
450000	451000	Was the alligator...
451000	452000	He said don't go over there.
452000	455000	Was the alligator on the Disney property?
455000	457000	The alligator was on.
458000	461000	That's a prime time alligator.
464000	467000	What part of the park was...
467000	468000	He had Mickey Mouse out.
468000	470000	No, he didn't have a Mickey Mouse.
470000	476000	He played, like, but not, but in an area where guests were supposed to keep at it.
476000	478000	Was it part of the Animal Kingdom part of the park?
478000	479000	No.
479000	480000	It was part of the gators.
480000	481000	It was funny.
481000	483000	And, like, the kid went swimming anyway.
483000	484000	Oh, yeah.
484000	485000	He got in.
485000	486000	It says no swimming.
486000	489000	But, okay, here's some other places you're not supposed to go in Disneyland.
489000	491000	The cash register.
491000	494000	Do you think they have more than signs keeping you out of those fucking things?
494000	496000	Underground.
496000	499000	They'll fucking cattle prod you, you try to stick your hand in the till.
501000	502000	Don't.
502000	503000	Don't.
503000	505000	Who cares if there was a goddamn...
505000	507000	I don't care.
507000	510000	What are the tickets to that place?
510000	511000	$8,000?
511000	517000	The kid probably had to choose between college and Disneyland before it could speak.
517000	519000	They're like, I'm sorry.
519000	524000	You're going to have to make this choice to, like, hold jangling a key chain with Mickey Mouse on it
524000	529000	and holding up one of those hats that I'd know the name of if I went to college.
531000	532000	A mortar and pestle?
532000	534000	What are those things called?
534000	535000	Mortar board hat?
535000	536000	Mortar and pestle.
536000	537000	Mortar and pestle.
537000	539000	It's called a mortar and pestle.
539000	540000	That's where you learn how to make...
540000	543000	You don't know, Mikey, but you're making a choice.
543000	549000	You all, like, live in the moment or be an adult with a stink in our workplace.
549000	551000	And the kid's like, I don't know.
551000	558000	That mouse looks like it's so appealing on an instinctive level
558000	564000	that for some reason it's exempt from fucking basic copyright law.
564000	567000	Didn't that thing become public domain in, like, fucking 1990?
567000	570000	And then it was like, obviously that doesn't count.
570000	572000	That doesn't count.
572000	576000	Mickey Mouse can't become public domain just because it's older than fucking Huck Finn.
578000	581000	That's not what we meant when we said that.
581000	583000	We didn't mean that.
584000	586000	Is Dennis Hopper still alive?
586000	589000	Or if anybody we know that can do a perfect Dennis Hopper impression,
589000	593000	I want to hear somebody reread what you just said as Dennis Hopper.
593000	595000	His mind, man.
595000	596000	His mind.
596000	599000	He's thinking about a good mouse now.
599000	602000	You think you're going on vacation, man?
602000	605000	You're going into a slaughterhouse.
607000	609000	Who's on the ride, okay?
609000	612000	The kids or the fucking animals?
612000	615000	We can do the frontier land.
615000	620000	Tomorrow lands are going to make Vanity Land look like Critter Country, man.
621000	623000	Critter Country.
623000	624000	Critter Country.
624000	627000	They're writing under the names that call lands Critter Country.
627000	629000	Well, I didn't finish my thought.
629000	631000	I know I've already harped on this, but I just wanted to finish that thought.
631000	634000	It's not Disney that did or didn't do anything wrong.
634000	637000	Just the people in the comment sections, as always.
637000	640000	Stop siding with a fucking inhuman system.
640000	642000	It doesn't need your help.
642000	645000	If someone falls off a cliff while playing Pokemon Go,
645000	647000	it's a tragedy.
647000	649000	A guy died.
649000	653000	You don't have to make a fucking point about your priorities.
653000	656000	You're like pall-bearing the American dream.
656000	658000	You pieces of shit.
658000	662000	You put on these masks and you get on the internet and you get...
662000	664000	What is it?
664000	666000	Cricut sound effects?
666000	670000	Somebody's phone ring is crickets,
670000	673000	which is rude for two reasons.
678000	681000	It's a bad place to go.
681000	685000	It's bad for a lot of things.
687000	691000	Turn your phones off, but if it's on, make your phone ring laughter.
692000	694000	Yeah, don't...
694000	698000	I might forget to turn my phone off, so just in case I do,
698000	700000	I'll do a fail-safe here.
700000	702000	My new ringtone...
702000	704000	You suck!
704000	706000	There. Now I'm protected.
706000	710000	I'm gonna turn my phone on and make it foghorn.
712000	714000	All right.
714000	716000	I don't need to talk about any of this other stuff.
716000	718000	You just found out that...
719000	721000	What's happening?
721000	725000	Okay, just keep it in your pants, buddy.
725000	727000	He said Dennis Hopper.
727000	729000	You wanted to remind me we were talking about Dennis Hopper.
729000	731000	Okay, I'm very sorry.
731000	734000	Are you saying that you can do a great Dennis Hopper impression?
734000	736000	I already did.
736000	738000	You did?
738000	740000	Let's hear it.
740000	742000	Let's hit the fucking road!
742000	745000	That sounds a little bit more like Bill Paxton from Aliens.
746000	748000	That's your phone.
748000	750000	Don't put a nickel on that side of the room anymore.
750000	753000	That guy...
753000	755000	The first thing he said was...
755000	758000	You were kind of siding on the alligator side.
758000	760000	You brought up the sign.
760000	762000	You were into the sign.
762000	764000	It said no swimming, so of course if an alligator eats you,
764000	766000	you deserve it.
766000	769000	And then someone over there with the fucking cricket phone,
769000	771000	and then back to you with this side of the room,
771000	773000	just trouble, you know?
773000	775000	Just trouble.
778000	780000	Spencer, come sit over with me.
780000	782000	No, I'm good.
782000	784000	Spencer, I thought you did a bang-up job.
784000	786000	Come chill with me.
790000	792000	You had a lot of shit in your plate.
792000	794000	There was children.
794000	797000	I really didn't do much about it.
797000	801000	She got two sentences into the haunted house story.
801000	804000	She goes, I want to go be with my wife.
804000	807000	The camera was like, no, I can stay.
807000	809000	I plucked my show.
809000	811000	She's like, are you sure?
811000	813000	I'm going to go and we're married.
813000	815000	She's like, no, I can stay.
815000	817000	Maybe I'll leave late.
817000	819000	So about this haunted house,
819000	821000	the oven is on right now.
823000	825000	Can't blame her.
825000	829000	I was five seconds away from doing the same thing.
832000	834000	All right, so yeah, yeah, I'm going to...
834000	836000	Look, there's things that I...
836000	838000	I mean, look, it doesn't matter.
838000	840000	I'm excited about our guests.
840000	841000	Let's talk to them.
841000	843000	We can talk to them about anything anyway.
847000	851000	All right, I'm not going to tailspin interpreting that.
851000	853000	You just like the show in general.
853000	854000	That's what that meant.
854000	857000	You like the part where I stop being the only thing up here.
861000	863000	I got my eye on you guys.
863000	865000	I can't see you.
865000	867000	There's lights, but I got my eye on you.
867000	869000	Dan, before we bring out our great guests,
869000	871000	can we talk to Jane for a moment,
871000	873000	because Jane has gifts for us.
873000	874000	Okay.
874000	876000	Come on up, Jane.
878000	882000	Jane, oh, secret abscess.
882000	885000	Totally illegal, and I'm not sharing it with any of you.
885000	887000	Yeah, you're staying at my place,
887000	889000	but you haven't seen me yet.
890000	892000	Whoa.
892000	895000	That's how it is with all the ladies.
897000	898000	Thank you.
898000	899000	Did you get it okay?
899000	901000	I got it okay. Thank you.
901000	903000	What is it like staying at Shea Harmon
903000	905000	when it's just like...
905000	906000	It's a little weird, right?
906000	908000	Because you don't even see me.
908000	910000	It's a small hotel.
910000	911000	Yeah.
911000	912000	But it's like self-serve.
912000	914000	It's like a Marriott Express.
914000	916000	Oh, yeah, it's nice in that way.
916000	918000	I could hear that something was going on upstairs.
918000	921000	It sounded very important.
921000	924000	I think it was probably just the night of.
924000	926000	It was like, you're probably just listening to me
926000	927000	watching the night of.
927000	928000	Was that what it was?
928000	929000	I don't know.
929000	931000	I was just hungover in bed with Cody.
931000	932000	We were watching that.
932000	933000	Oh, okay, yeah.
933000	935000	There was lots of voices,
935000	937000	and there was pregnant pauses,
937000	939000	and then things were going on.
939000	941000	Yeah, no, it's very nice. Thank you.
941000	943000	Yep.
944000	946000	It kind of sounds like I murdered Cody.
947000	949000	And I'm now not going to get away with it,
949000	950000	which is a good time to...
950000	952000	Is she back there?
952000	953000	Well, we'll find out.
953000	955000	We haven't seen Cody for 72 hours,
955000	957000	which is weird.
957000	958000	Let's...
958000	959000	Thank you so much, Jane.
959000	960000	Yeah, I just dropped off the...
960000	962000	How are things going with you?
962000	964000	Are there any headlines?
964000	966000	Is there any drama in your life?
966000	967000	Oh, God.
967000	968000	Anything we can consume?
968000	970000	I don't want to take time away from the guests.
970000	972000	I could go on with the drama.
972000	974000	I'm here for 24 hours, so I...
974000	976000	Give us a little tease.
976000	979000	Just be like, I found a head in my trunk,
979000	981000	and then just go sit down, and then we'll bring them up.
981000	983000	That'd be a good cue for this, right?
983000	984000	Yeah, nothing like that.
984000	987000	Jane brought a bottle of Absinthe for me today
987000	988000	at the drawing room,
988000	991000	and she also wanted to bring one for Marilyn Manson,
991000	994000	who's a big Absinthe freak, who has his own Absinthe...
994000	996000	Yeah, you called it Mansinthe.
996000	998000	But you turned me on to that possibility.
998000	999000	Right.
999000	1003000	So we have now handed off your Absinthe to...
1003000	1006000	to someone that will give Marilyn Manson
1006000	1008000	the Absinthe of malice that you make.
1008000	1009000	That's my hope.
1009000	1013000	Do you think he'll talk about it on his blog, Mansplaining?
1013000	1014000	Which...
1014000	1015000	Mansplaining.
1015000	1017000	Which I get so annoyed by, but...
1017000	1018000	Marilyn...
1018000	1020000	It is his point of view.
1020000	1022000	Mansplaining.
1022000	1023000	I was proud of it.
1023000	1025000	Fuck you guys.
1025000	1027000	It got all the applause it deserved.
1027000	1029000	Yeah.
1029000	1031000	All right, well, we'll check in with you later.
1031000	1032000	Yeah, I know, it's cool.
1032000	1033000	All right, let's bring our friends out here.
1033000	1034000	Thank you, Jane.
1034000	1036000	I appreciate the gift we love you.
1036000	1039000	Also, Jane, I have your glass right here, too.
1039000	1041000	Thank you so much.
1041000	1043000	Dan, do the honors for our guests.
1043000	1045000	Oh, wait, what?
1045000	1046000	Oh.
1046000	1048000	I cut you off while you were about to intro our guests.
1048000	1049000	Okay, so...
1049000	1050000	Okay, thank you, sorry.
1050000	1051000	It's like Thanksgiving dinner, and all of a sudden,
1051000	1053000	Dad's like, you're time to cut the turkey,
1053000	1055000	and I'm like, what?
1055000	1056000	Don't fuck this up,
1056000	1060000	and then get your car keys in the footing.
1061000	1063000	Yeah, all right, well, our guests are...
1063000	1064000	I'm so stoked that we could...
1064000	1067000	I feel privileged that we could bag these guests,
1067000	1068000	because I think there's probably a lot of people
1068000	1069000	that want to talk to them,
1069000	1072000	because they've got this little hit podcast,
1072000	1073000	My Favorite Murder.
1073000	1077000	It's like meteorically popular.
1077000	1080000	Is it true that it's more popular than our podcast?
1080000	1081000	I have no idea.
1081000	1083000	I think it's a bigger hit than our own podcast.
1083000	1085000	I don't see the world for that one.
1085000	1086000	I think we're doing ourselves a disservice
1086000	1088000	by even bringing these two out here.
1088000	1089000	Oh, that's fine.
1089000	1094000	I'd be happy to hold up that quarter of the chuppah
1094000	1100000	in a Jewish wedding between the audience and creatives.
1100000	1104000	I will hold up one of the two quarters.
1104000	1109000	You and I are half a chuppah.
1109000	1113000	That's our promise to you.
1113000	1116000	And we will sit shiva for you
1116000	1122000	should the chuppah collapse and kill you.
1122000	1123000	Maybe one of our guests is Jewish
1123000	1125000	and can help us out.
1125000	1127000	I know they're going to talk to us about murder
1127000	1129000	and podcasting and...
1129000	1131000	I can almost be certain that
1131000	1132000	with a name like Karen Kilgariff,
1132000	1135000	she has to be Jewish.
1135000	1139000	Or certainly has to host a murder podcast.
1139000	1140000	Please welcome Karen Kilgariff
1140000	1141000	and Georgia Hardstark.
689820	1146000	Tribe of Jewish.
1146000	1147000	Yeah.
1147000	1150000	This place is coming to you.
1150000	1153000	I have to follow you.
1153000	1156000	I know this here is to you.
1156000	1159000	I'm telling you,
1159000	1162000	we can promise to you.
1162000	1163000	Ah, welcome.
1163000	1164000	La haya.
1164000	1166000	Yeah.
1166000	1168000	Do you remember the last time I saw you, Karen?
1168000	1170000	I feel like it was decades ago.
1170000	1172000	Was it in that bar?
1172000	1173000	That bar.
1173000	1174000	And we were just talking massive shit
1174000	1175000	on that one person.
1175000	1176000	Yes.
1176000	1177000	Yeah.
1177000	1178000	Do you judge me for that?
1178000	1181000	It's the way I live my life.
1181000	1183000	I listen to your podcast.
1183000	1185000	My girlfriend is how I found out about it.
1185000	1186000	She's such a huge fan.
1186000	1188000	And I was like, oh, that's Karen.
1188000	1189000	And I listened to it for a while.
1189000	1191000	She's like, I love her so much.
1191000	1192000	And I said, yeah, you know,
1192000	1194000	she's really wise and really good.
1194000	1195000	Has always been an old soul
1195000	1196000	because I remember that conversation
1196000	1199000	as you being so chill and accepting
1199000	1200000	all this stuff.
1200000	1201000	And I felt like I was like
1201000	1203000	toxically like bagging on a mutual friend
1203000	1206000	because I had like axes to grind
1206000	1207000	that were like,
1207000	1209000	I was probably like 27 or something?
1209000	1210000	Yeah.
1210000	1211000	Who are you talking about?
1211000	1214000	Do you see what care we've taken to not...
1214000	1217000	We are tiptoeing the shit out of this thing.
1217000	1218000	Knowing Karen, though,
1218000	1220000	she loved you even more because of that conversation.
1220000	1222000	Yes, because I'm filled with hatred.
1222000	1224000	Well, I think the thing that I liked about,
1224000	1225000	that stuck with me,
1225000	1226000	it was like, oh, God,
1226000	1227000	I love Karen Kilgariff,
1227000	1228000	was that in that conversation,
1228000	1229000	in spite of talking to like,
1229000	1231000	who you might have been a toxic turd
1231000	1232000	and jury's still out,
1232000	1235000	like you were very forthcoming with like,
1235000	1237000	you told me this very vulnerable part of your life,
1237000	1239000	which I don't even know if you share that a lot on your,
1239000	1240000	on your podcast.
1240000	1241000	What did it say?
1241000	1242000	You talked about your,
1242000	1244000	you had an injury that...
1244000	1245000	Oh, epilepsy, yeah.
1245000	1246000	Yeah, okay.
1246000	1247000	I wasn't sure if that was something,
1247000	1249000	it was your private life or something.
1249000	1251000	You had like bouts with epilepsy
1251000	1253000	where you would have like these like
1253000	1254000	Russian literary,
1254000	1257000	Russian novelist style seizures
1257000	1259000	and like wake up and there'd be blood everywhere.
1259000	1260000	And an axe in my head.
1260000	1261000	Yeah.
1261000	1262000	An axe in your head.
1262000	1263000	That's a Russian novelist.
1263000	1265000	She was talking about Raskolnikov.
1265000	1266000	Yeah, man.
1266000	1267000	That's a kind of punishment, Jack.
1267000	1268000	I got it.
1268000	1269000	Come on, grad students.
1269000	1270000	All right.
1270000	1271000	All right.
1271000	1272000	Well, that's a relief.
1272000	1273000	God, I'm so glad.
1273000	1274000	Are you still dealing with epilepsy?
1274000	1276000	Is there a thing that goes on for the rest of your life?
1276000	1277000	It is, yeah.
1277000	1279000	But I take medicine that controls it.
1279000	1281000	But do you have Raskolnikov style seizures?
1281000	1283000	Or is that too literary?
1283000	1285000	I actually don't know who that is.
1285000	1286000	I'm not going to pretend.
1286000	1288000	But I believe do.
1288000	1290000	My seizures are controlled with medicine.
1290000	1292000	But when I do have them,
1292000	1294000	I believe they're their grandma.
1294000	1296000	They're the big ones.
1296000	1297000	I just go for it.
1297000	1299000	But that's the reason I stopped drinking.
1299000	1301000	If you're going to go, go big.
1301000	1302000	Yeah, right.
1302000	1303000	Don't fuck around with seizures.
1303000	1304000	Don't do.
1304000	1305000	Yeah, exactly.
1305000	1307000	Put the pedal to the metal.
1307000	1309000	When you have epilepsy,
1309000	1312000	do you stop drinking because...
1313000	1316000	Is it because you'd be ill-prepared to handle a seizure if it happened?
1316000	1319000	Or is it because it actually increases the seizures?
1319000	1320000	They say...
1320000	1323000	I mean, the funniest thing is when you have a neurological problem,
1323000	1325000	they have no idea what they're talking about.
1325000	1329000	Like, they try to tell you things, but it's all, am I right?
1329000	1332000	As a self-loathing neurologist.
1332000	1334000	It's the seventh year of grad school.
1334000	1337000	I don't know what I'm doing.
1337000	1339000	But it really is all theory.
1339000	1341000	It's all theory.
1341000	1344000	So, I mean, I was a huge drinker and drink every day and night
1344000	1348000	and had no problem with it until I started having seizures.
1348000	1351000	And then they said, oh, well, you are having seizures
1351000	1353000	from alcohol withdrawal.
1353000	1356000	And I literally said to the doctor, but I've never stopped drinking.
1356000	1361000	Like, total honest trying to solve the problem.
1361000	1364000	So, obviously, you know Dino because you worked on Mr. Show.
1364000	1365000	Yeah, yeah.
1365000	1368000	It continues to be the Yoda of my drinking.
1368000	1369000	He's the greatest.
1370000	1374000	We were at the drawing room yesterday at Saturday.
1374000	1376000	Saturday morning at the drawing room,
1376000	1379000	you have these people that they're called the zombies.
1379000	1382000	They're the people that were at after hours on Friday night.
1382000	1384000	And the drawing room opens at 6 a.m.
1384000	1388000	So, they're there, but then also maybe me and Dino and Jeff maybe.
1388000	1391000	And Dino had this conversation with one of them.
1391000	1393000	It's like they really are zombies.
1393000	1395000	They've been partying straight through.
1395000	1398000	And this guy was like, yeah, I'm really sorry, man.
1398000	1400000	I didn't, you know, look.
1400000	1401000	He did one of those things.
1401000	1402000	These are the kind of people.
1402000	1403000	I'm sorry.
1403000	1404000	I totally derailed what we were talking about.
1404000	1405000	No, no, no.
1405000	1406000	I just wanted to say this one quote that reminded me of from Dino.
1406000	1407000	He's talking to this guy.
1407000	1410000	The guy goes like, man, I've been partying for like 36 hours.
1410000	1413000	I was at it after hours and then I came here.
1413000	1415000	And Dino said, yeah, we came here from bed.
1415000	1416000	We're real alcoholics.
1418000	1421000	Anyone can go from drinking to drinking.
1421000	1422000	So easy.
1422000	1423000	We came here from the shower.
1423000	1426000	And I was like, I don't even shower.
1427000	1428000	We woke up and said, what's up?
1428000	1429000	Let's go to the bar.
1429000	1431000	When you wake up and you're not like, what did I do?
1431000	1432000	You're like, let's keep going.
1432000	1434000	But you know, you're like, you're good.
1434000	1435000	Make it happen.
1435000	1436000	You're like, what am I going to do?
1436000	1437000	Let's do it.
1437000	1438000	Yeah, exactly.
1438000	1443000	That's like Isaac Newton even said, like, if you're drinking
1443000	1445000	and you keep drinking, that's nothing.
1445000	1446000	Totally.
1446000	1450000	That's like the fifth law of thermodynamics.
1450000	1453000	He called it no biggie.
1453000	1454000	OK.
1454000	1456000	So wait, why am I getting this out?
1456000	1457000	Because I know everything.
1457000	1458000	OK.
1458000	1460000	So I want you guys to guide the path here.
1460000	1464000	Because I'm so fascinated with true crime just as a human being.
1464000	1467000	I mean, I think we could just nerd out about it a little bit
1467000	1468000	and about murder itself.
1468000	1470000	And of course, we're going to do that no matter what.
1470000	1472000	But I'm super fascinated.
1472000	1473000	But I have this problem.
1473000	1476000	I'm always running my mouth about gender and all this stuff
1476000	1479000	on the show and like prefacing it by going like, of course,
1479000	1481000	we're all equal and no difference.
1481000	1483000	And that's all stupid general statements and all this stuff.
1483000	1485000	But there's this fascinating role I feel like.
1485000	1487000	And I think you guys have touched on it.
1487000	1492000	And our mutual friend Kat Solon is doing that other thing that's
1492000	1495000	going to be a true crime thing and talking to her about it.
1495000	1498000	It's like there is this theme arising that's like, well, OK.
1498000	1503000	It's totally understandably politically not cool
1503000	1506000	to imply that women are wired differently at all.
1506000	1513000	And yet there is this beautiful advanced state that it seems like,
1513000	1514000	I don't know.
1514000	1516000	It just seems like women are more into true crime.
1516000	1520000	And it seems like now there's all these amazing true crime shows happening
1520000	1523000	because there's a generation that's bringing it out of the gutter
1523000	1528000	and making the dark chocolate the artisanal true crime stuff.
1528000	1530000	That's right.
1530000	1535000	It's like, OK, you don't have to feel like it's a guilty pleasure
1535000	1536000	anymore.
1536000	1539000	It's not like, oh, I'm trapped in a trailer and I don't like myself,
1539000	1542000	so I'm dwelling on the grisly details of people.
1542000	1544000	The only people worse off than me.
1544000	1548000	And I'll just keep doing scratch offs and looking down on murder victims.
1548000	1553000	We thought maybe that's what it was, this tabloidy, trashy thing.
1553000	1557000	But now it can be sophisticated.
1557000	1560000	And now are we noticing?
1560000	1565000	You can please tell me gender means nothing, has nothing to do with this.
1565000	1568000	Or tell me women are more into true crime for some awesome reason.
1568000	1570000	I think saying gender is nothing.
1570000	1572000	And we are so different.
1572000	1573000	We totally wire different.
1573000	1575000	There's no shame to say that.
1575000	1578000	I know, but you know these fucking kids.
1578000	1579000	Jesus Christ.
1579000	1581000	I know, everyone likes to react.
1581000	1585000	But also it's good to be on guard against somebody like Belushi like me going,
1585000	1588000	if I start talking about gender, they're right to set up road flayers
1588000	1591000	and be like, grandpa's talking about women.
1591000	1594000	Get a rope.
1594000	1596000	It's all about self-correction.
1596000	1599000	We fuck up all the time on the podcast.
1599000	1601000	We say shit because we're just talking.
1601000	1603000	And then later on people are like,
1603000	1606000	hi, just to let you know that was totally wrong and you're racist.
1606000	1608000	And then we go like, sorry, that is not what we meant.
1608000	1609000	We acknowledge it.
1609000	1611000	We'd like say beforehand, like trigger warning,
1611000	1613000	like if you're not okay with people being wrong all the time,
1613000	1615000	then you're not going to fucking like this podcast.
1615000	1616000	Yeah, you will hate our podcast.
1616000	1617000	We should do that.
1617000	1624000	We could definitely trigger warning.
1624000	1625000	Don't listen to this podcast.
1625000	1626000	Yeah.
1626000	1628000	I mean, honestly, just don't listen to it.
1628000	1632000	But there is somebody that on our Twitter page that just did you read that
1632000	1635000	that somebody wrote an article about exactly this thing,
1635000	1638000	which is why are women so into true crime?
1638000	1643000	I'm very sorry that I don't know her name offhand man.
1643000	1645000	But essentially this is her.
1645000	1647000	This is her article is really brilliantly written,
1647000	1650000	but it's when women watch true crime shows, say, for example,
1650000	1653000	they can picture themselves being the murderer and the victim.
1653000	1654000	I see.
1654000	1658000	And that's the thing where it's not that men don't have bad things happen to them.
1658000	1659000	Now we have to do this.
1659000	1660000	It's not that men can't be hurt.
1660000	1661000	Oh, same.
1661000	1663000	And you give so much to the community.
1663000	1667000	Bad things happen to men too, you guys.
1667000	1669000	It happens.
1669000	1673000	But with women, you have mirror neurons.
1673000	1676000	You're experiencing both positions.
1676000	1679000	And when you said that, I was like, aha, that's it.
1679000	1682000	But I didn't even think it was like, oh, because of the cultural ramifications
1682000	1686000	of the whole glass ceiling, whatever, that always in true crime,
1686000	1688000	the victim is usually a woman.
1688000	1689000	There's that too.
1689000	1691000	But I was actually going, aha.
1691000	1697000	That is a mythically feminine characteristic.
1697000	1701000	And this can be just as much of a yoke and an infantilizing,
1701000	1703000	like, sexist thing to say.
1703000	1704000	You're more intuitive.
1704000	1706000	You're more acquiescent.
1706000	1707000	You get it.
1707000	1709000	You're better scanners when I lose my car keys.
1709000	1712000	That's not a compliment.
1712000	1716000	Well, black people have big dicks as a compliment too.
1716000	1719000	But look how they react.
1719000	1720000	They made it.
1720000	1725000	It's also a way to objectify, dehumanize, whatever.
1725000	1726000	No, you're different.
1726000	1727000	You're little brains.
1727000	1730000	You work different.
1730000	1731000	But I feel safe.
1731000	1732000	It is safe.
1732000	1735000	I'm safely on the side of your big brains.
1735000	1736000	They work different.
1736000	1740000	Because I think I'm such a Campbell freak.
1740000	1743000	And all of this, there's a meeting with the goddess in mythology
1743000	1747000	at the bottom that as low as a hero can go,
1747000	1750000	and depth not low as in down on his luck,
1750000	1754000	low down into exploring the chaos and unconscious of the human condition
1754000	1758000	and beyond, a hero comes to this point in the story
1758000	1764000	where it often involves aqueous things, swampy bogs and wells
1764000	1766000	and womb metaphors and things.
1766000	1769000	And there's a feminine energy to it.
1769000	1773000	Sometimes it's literally a damsel in distress or it's a witch.
1773000	1775000	Sometimes it's literally a woman.
1775000	1777000	Sometimes it's just a destination or whatever.
1777000	1779000	But it's like Campbell calls it the meeting with the goddess.
1779000	1782000	And it almost feels like when I think of true crime
1782000	1785000	and I think about how when Kat Solon, our friend,
1785000	1790000	when she talks about murder and why people are interested in it,
1790000	1793000	I'm like, I just have to keep making her repeat it
1793000	1796000	because I can't repeat it because I try to like repeat it to other people
1796000	1800000	and go like, well, the thing about murder is it's bad.
1800000	1802000	And I'm like, Kat, what did you say, Kat?
1802000	1803000	What did you say?
1803000	1806000	And it's like she just remembers how she's like,
1806000	1812000	it has something to do with people who murder people.
1812000	1815000	They are closer to death.
1815000	1817000	When I say it, it sounds dumb.
1817000	1820000	She says this amazing thing.
1820000	1823000	They're grasping the fact that we're all going to die
1823000	1825000	and they're in control of that death.
1825000	1828000	So as someone who's had anxiety my entire life
1828000	1831000	and who's also been into true crime and death stories my entire life,
1831000	1834000	it's like proving the fact that my anxiety is legitimate
1834000	1837000	but also at the same time making me prepared
1837000	1841000	on how to avoid certain situations where I could get killed.
1841000	1845000	I feel like we're talking about trigger warnings.
1845000	1848000	We're talking about all this stuff, these highway cones and all these things.
1848000	1851000	Your show is like part of it is people trust you guys.
1851000	1855000	Like whatever that thing is that made me feel when I heard your name again,
1855000	1858000	oh, fuck, she thinks I'm a piece of shit from 20 years ago.
1858000	1859000	That's my eyebrows.
1859000	1861000	You have some essence about you.
1861000	1863000	They go in like that.
1863000	1864000	You're a sage person.
1864000	1866000	You're very put together.
1866000	1868000	I feel like there's not a lot of shit people could throw at you
1868000	1873000	where you slip up and reveal that you had some fucked up value system.
1873000	1874000	Or epilepsy.
1874000	1876000	People trust you.
1876000	1878000	And Georgia, whatever.
1878000	1879000	Come on.
1879000	1881000	Oh, okay.
1881000	1882000	It was a joke.
1882000	1884000	Oh, God, Jesus.
1884000	1888000	How did you, Georgia and Karen, get together on this?
1888000	1890000	What was the nexus of you guys starting?
1890000	1894000	We have to make a podcast about true crime.
1894000	1898000	The short version is we were at a party together
1898000	1901000	and I was telling a terrible story
1901000	1905000	about a terrible violent thing that I witnessed,
1905000	1907000	which was at the South by Southwest.
1907000	1909000	I think it was now three years ago.
1909000	1910000	The car killed everybody?
1910000	1912000	Yeah, I was on the street.
1912000	1913000	I was a couple of blocks away from that.
1913000	1914000	Really?
1914000	1915000	Yeah.
1915000	1916000	I was the last person in line.
1916000	1918000	And I fucking love telling stories like this
1918000	1920000	and I never get the response I want.
1920000	1922000	I was the last person in line.
1922000	1925000	And then my friends had walked away to the front
1925000	1927000	because X was playing.
1927000	1929000	And they walked up to hear X.
1929000	1930000	And then I was like, oh, fine.
1930000	1931000	Why am I waiting in line?
1931000	1934000	And I walked up and I walked up to say,
1934000	1935000	let's not wait in line.
1935000	1936000	Let's just stand out here.
1936000	1938000	And that fucking car came, broke through the barrier,
1938000	1940000	plowed through like 30 people.
1940000	1942000	Thank God my back was to the crowd.
1942000	1946000	But I mean, we were a mere feet away.
1946000	1949000	And I told that story at a party at a Halloween party
1949000	1952000	where most people had eaten a lot of edibles.
1952000	1956000	And so everybody around me just kind of went gray.
1956000	1958000	And it was like, what?
1958000	1961000	And then she from like two people back was like,
1961000	1962000	wait, wait, tell me the story.
1962000	1964000	And like her eyes were like.
1964000	1967000	I was also, I was dressed like Glenn Danzig too.
1967000	1968000	At the Halloween party?
1968000	1969000	And I was like, what app?
1969000	1970000	Tell me everything.
1970000	1974000	Did you wear shorter shoes so you could be tiny?
1974000	1976000	That cat letter with me.
1976000	1982000	Well, so that zeal and that trust or whatever,
1982000	1984000	if that's the combination, whatever it is,
1984000	1986000	is true crime in general.
1986000	1989000	Is it a safe place from this sort of,
1989000	1993000	from our anxiety about political correctness and stuff?
1993000	1996000	Because it's simultaneously what could be more sensitive
1996000	1998000	than caring if people got killed.
1998000	1999000	That's right.
1999000	2001000	You guys aren't the insane clown posse.
2001000	2005000	You're not using fear to make music.
2005000	2007000	Look how not scared we are of it.
2007000	2011000	You're going like, oh, look at this terrible thing when you
2011000	2013000	indulge in true crime.
2013000	2021000	But it's also unmistakably, you can't dress it up as noble.
2021000	2022000	It's real people.
2022000	2024000	Real people have died.
2024000	2028000	And on our Facebook page, there was a woman that got on insisting
2028000	2030000	that she was a fan, insisting.
2030000	2034000	And it was like a thread that went probably like almost 300
2034000	2036000	comments with this woman going, look,
2036000	2037000	I'm a huge fan of the podcast.
2037000	2039000	I'm just saying, isn't this exploitation?
2039000	2041000	Isn't this the worst thing you could do?
2041000	2043000	And she was arguing with every, and people would come on and go,
2043000	2045000	I really don't think that's the way they're doing it.
2045000	2048000	But isn't this entertainment at the cost of a person who died?
2048000	2049000	Isn't this?
2049000	2051000	And she just kept arguing it.
2051000	2054000	And finally I went on and I said, you're using this word
2054000	2058000	entertainment as if it's all fun a day at the carnival.
2058000	2061000	And although this is entertainment to me,
2061000	2066000	what it actually is is me going into the reality of being
2066000	2069000	murdered, being the person that's in the apartment
2069000	2071000	when some fucking dude walks in.
2071000	2074000	The family of the fucking people who have to deal with this murder
2074000	2078000	that isn't going to go to trial because they never find the killer
2078000	2081000	or it goes to trial and they get fucking off in five years.
2081000	2083000	I think the other part of our friendship that I think brings a
2083000	2088000	lot to this is that we kind of bonded over vulnerability being a thing
2088000	2091000	off Renee Brown, thank fucking God.
2091000	2095000	And so when we became friends it was like in this idea of being
2095000	2097000	super vulnerable around each other.
2097000	2100000	And I think talking about how much we're fascinated and scared
2100000	2105000	and have anxiety over true crime and depression is a big part of it.
2105000	2108000	So you weren't friends until that night when you guys met at that party
2108000	2109000	and talked about that?
2109000	2110000	Like you guys became friends then?
2110000	2113000	I think we had met like once before, but we didn't like hang or...
2113000	2114000	But there was not a bonding moment.
2114000	2116000	So that's your origin story, not just the podcast,
2116000	2119000	but of you guys being like a duo, like a friendship.
2119000	2120000	Yes.
2120000	2121000	That's great.
2121000	2123000	And then we'd meet for lunch and talk about our favorite truth.
2123000	2125000	Like the conversation would go that way.
2125000	2126000	Can I ask you a question?
2126000	2130000	What do you think about Nancy Grace?
2130000	2134000	I think she's bad for journalism.
2134000	2136000	I think she is...
2136000	2138000	The fact that she focuses...
2138000	2142000	It's like any small blonde, anything that dies,
2142000	2144000	that's when she jumps in front of that camera.
2144000	2148000	I rarely see her talking about people of race and color,
2148000	2150000	which is so many of these murders.
2150000	2153000	The more research we do, there's that real creepy...
2153000	2155000	And like this is what we're talking about.
2155000	2159000	Like these are the things we're stumbling on as genuine amateurs,
2159000	2162000	is when you talk about like women of color who are murdered,
2162000	2164000	there are cases you've never fucking heard of.
2164000	2167000	Even if you think you're like the true crime expert,
2167000	2170000	there's like Georgia did one about a murderer in DC
2170000	2173000	that was just like it was a bunch of very young black girls,
2173000	2174000	and you've...
2174000	2177000	It's like not BTK and it's certainly not jumping in.
2177000	2180000	Nancy Grace gets vehement about like...
2180000	2182000	Like Jodie Arias or whatever it was.
2182000	2184000	I don't even know what the fuck that was,
2184000	2187000	except for that she was like blonde before
2187000	2189000	and then a brunette afterwards.
2189000	2191000	But it was on the news every day.
2191000	2192000	Because of Nancy Grace.
2192000	2193000	I like brunettes.
2193000	2194000	Yeah.
2194000	2198000	I also think that when you get that like definitive about your opinions
2198000	2202000	about what happened and you get that like definitive about what's wrong
2202000	2205000	and like I think when we talk about these true crimes,
2205000	2208000	it's exploring the murders and exploring the crime
2208000	2210000	instead of just being like,
2210000	2212000	here's what fucking happened and period.
2212000	2218000	Isn't that as we make true crime classier in this golden age of TV,
2219000	2223000	and I'm not counting one of your favorites, the OJ thing,
2223000	2224000	which I love too.
2224000	2225000	I mean, The Simpsons.
2225000	2226000	That felt delightfully...
2226000	2229000	Georgia called it The Simpsons.
2229000	2231000	The Simpsons.
2232000	2234000	You're still the juice juice.
2234000	2236000	Uncle Juice.
2236000	2237000	Uncle Juice.
2237000	2239000	I was just listening to you guys talk about...
2239000	2242000	Do you think what killed him is having to say Uncle Juice many times?
2242000	2244000	I like sell it.
2244000	2246000	He got Uncle Juice cancer.
2247000	2251000	But talking about the idea that we could make it,
2251000	2254000	you know, get past the reenactment footage with the strobing
2254000	2256000	and the male voiceover going like,
2256000	2260000	what she didn't know was murder, murder, murder.
2260000	2263000	Which those always involve a red lace bra.
2263000	2266000	If you're obsessed with like any of those shows with reenactments,
2266000	2269000	talk about Exploitive for 15 years.
2269000	2272000	Keith Harrison was that ghoulish...
2272000	2273000	Keith Morrison.
2273000	2274000	Keith Morrison.
2274000	2276000	Ooh, I hate it.
2276000	2277000	I hate it.
2277000	2278000	I love it.
2278000	2280000	Is that 2020 or what is that?
2280000	2281000	Dateline?
2281000	2282000	Dateline.
2282000	2283000	20 Dateline.
2283000	2285000	I think it's a Dateline 20s.
2285000	2288000	If it's him doing it, I can't watch it.
2288000	2291000	Even though I love True Crime and Murder of the Week shit.
2291000	2294000	I can't do it because he's such a shitty writer.
2294000	2296000	Well, and also he's selling that.
2296000	2298000	First of all, his nose is very sharp.
2298000	2301000	And then he's kind of like, he's like staring the camera down
2301000	2304000	like a weird snake where you're like, okay, just move on.
2304000	2308000	But did he know that when she left, that would be the last time?
2308000	2311000	Or did he know that he was like, stop asking questions, Cocksucker.
2311000	2313000	You're the fucking journalist.
2313000	2314000	Give me some answers.
2314000	2315000	We don't know.
2315000	2316000	Why you keep asking me questions.
2316000	2318000	Also those shows like, when they come back from a commercial break,
2318000	2322000	like the first half of it is like catching you up of what you already fucking saw.
2322000	2323000	Can't do it.
2323000	2325000	That show should be 20 minutes.
2325000	2326000	Yes.
2326000	2329000	So is it once for sale there when you flock to True Crime
2329000	2331000	because you're like, Oh, a death happened.
2331000	2332000	I want to know details.
2332000	2333000	Okay.
2333000	2336000	So like, like we are conditioned to be a little bit ashamed of that.
2336000	2339000	There's a little bit of like, cause you're rubbernecking on the freeway.
2339000	2341000	Like, like, like you're slowing down traffic.
2341000	2342000	Don't you understand?
2342000	2343000	It's your patriotic duty.
2343000	2346000	Your duty to your species to not be fascinated with the innards that are
2346000	2349000	squirting out of someone that has suffered this horrible fate.
2349000	2350000	It's not the fireworks for you.
2350000	2352000	You're a terrible person.
2352000	2353000	You're neither.
2353000	2356000	And, but underneath that is this insidious message of like,
2356000	2359000	with that, this then carried through by serial killers who do these like
2359000	2362000	interviews and they go like, I'm a super being because everyone else is
2362000	2363000	ashamed of this stuff.
2363000	2365000	And it's like, well, wait a minute.
2365000	2369000	What if we weren't and what, and are we because it should be because the,
2369000	2373000	when people die and we want to know details and when it's weird that people
2373000	2375000	died, I'm so terrified right now.
2375000	2382000	Thank you, sir.
2382000	2384000	That could have been a knife.
2385000	2387000	What the fuck are you doing?
2387000	2388000	You just stood there.
2388000	2390000	You sat there.
2390000	2393000	Jesus.
2393000	2394000	I don't know.
2394000	2395000	It's super weird.
2395000	2399000	This dude walked up and really slowly stabbed Georgia and Karen and Dan.
2399000	2401000	It's weird.
2401000	2405000	Georgia and Karen, you guys, you said that as a woman, you're watching this and
2405000	2409000	that women you think feel that you can put yourself more in the shoes of the
2409000	2411000	killer and the, and the victim as well.
2411000	2412000	Yeah.
2412000	2414000	How much of it, cause I watch it.
2414000	2415000	Is this the same for you too?
2415000	2419000	Like you say like you start trying to craft in your own mind how you would
2419000	2420000	have done it.
2420000	2424000	Like what part of it is like, I'm going to kill somebody and all I need is like
2424000	2425000	a backyard.
2425000	2428000	Oh, I did the opposite where I'm like, how would I fucking karate chop this
2428000	2430000	dude who's trying to kill me?
2430000	2432000	His parkouring into my fucking apartment.
2432000	2435000	And there's a deeper thing there too, which is I'm trying to, I believe I've
2435000	2439000	been trying to ask my first question.
2439000	2441000	And that's on me, not anyone else.
2442000	2447000	Like it's, it's, is it a, what are we, aren't we actually kind of memorializing
2447000	2453000	and also like honoring like, isn't our, when we, because fucking giraffes don't
2453000	2454000	do it.
2454000	2455000	That's for sure.
2455000	2457000	Like, like ants and, and, and baboons.
2457000	2462000	Like if a, if a dead, if a person dies, the weirder, the accident, the murder,
2462000	2467000	the, we, we, we are desire for details that we call ghoulishness.
2468000	2469000	It's just a human reaction.
2469000	2470000	That's, that's the human.
2470000	2474000	We're reaching our little tendrils out and we're like to a, to a wound in the,
2474000	2476000	in the, and we're going like, okay, here's the threshold.
2476000	2480000	The threshold has opened up between life and death here and not through the way
2480000	2484000	that have been, you know, co-opted and systematized by pharmaceutical companies
2484000	2485000	and hospitals and everything.
2485000	2488000	You know, it's like where you just kind of, we, you don't deal with death.
2488000	2492000	We think of death as a disease and, and, and one that's weirdly that like people
2492000	2497000	it's like, it's like, we, we have this like crazy relationship with, or lack of
2497000	2498000	with death.
2498000	2503000	And when people are so, but we still have that we could get a, it's like,
2503000	2505000	oh, someone got impaled with a stop sign.
2505000	2507000	And we're just like, how does that happen?
2507000	2508000	Yes.
2508000	2509000	Where was he going?
2509000	2510000	How much he had, had he drank?
2510000	2512000	When will it happen to me?
2512000	2515000	And if it was going to happen to me, how would I know it was about to happen?
2515000	2517000	It's like one of the first things we ever talked about.
2517000	2522000	Remember last Halloween or the one before when that guy got in that car accident
2522000	2527000	on the five and he ended up, it cut in half and up on this, on the exit sign.
2528000	2529000	In Glendale.
2529000	2531000	It was so intense.
2531000	2532000	It's horrible.
2532000	2533000	I'm sorry.
2533000	2536000	I bet there's some people here who are like, I did not come here for that.
2536000	2539000	But it is this like, he landed on the side on the side.
2539000	2542000	But he was speeding and he was being a, he was being a crazy person.
2542000	2545000	He was like driving past people and it was, it was a horrible, horrible thing
2545000	2546000	altogether.
2546000	2550000	But I mean, how many times have you driven in LA on a freeway going like 95
2550000	2553000	because everyone else is going 95 and going, how is this going to end?
2553000	2554000	This could end.
2554000	2557000	I'm in a tin box driving 95.
2557000	2558000	This could go really badly.
2558000	2561000	Well, it went really badly for that guy.
2561000	2563000	How do you not look at that?
2563000	2565000	Murder is like that was that guy's decision.
2565000	2569000	But like, and I think what like what I concentrate on female murder so much is
2569000	2570000	that it's not fucking fair.
2570000	2571000	Like you're living your life.
2571000	2575000	You're you're going to college or you're trying to fucking live your own life.
2575000	2577000	And then some fucker comes and takes it away from you.
2577000	2579000	And he's just some fucking idiot drug addict piece of shit.
2579000	2581000	And it's just so unfair.
2581000	2582000	It bothers me so much.
2582000	2585000	So I want to read about it and find out what their experience was and find out
2585000	2589000	what their family's experience was because they're the entire their entire
2589000	2592000	circle of people that they know and have cared about and have cared about them.
2592000	2594000	Their lives are fucking changed forever.
2594000	2597000	And that's what I don't like about as much as I watch all the forensic files
2597000	2602000	and date lines in 2020s and all that stuff and any movie about it.
2602000	2608000	I hate the journalism because when they're like, but he was being the guy.
2608000	2612000	He was being so cold and not emotional when it was happening.
2612000	2614000	But my girlfriend, we were watching the staircase again.
2614000	2615000	It gives you that one.
2615000	2618000	And apparently everybody gets volume, but their lawyers are like, here,
2618000	2622000	take a bunch of volume whenever you're being interviewed so that you seem like
2622000	2623000	so you don't overreact.
2623000	2624000	Oh, my God.
2624000	2629000	The whole 911 call thing where it's like I panic so much like like Gone Girl was
2629000	2634000	like was like my worst nightmare, like the first act of it because it was like
2634000	2635000	poorly.
2635000	2636000	It was it.
2637000	2641000	It plugged into my fear that that I would wake up one day and something with
2641000	2645000	some weird thing would have befallen a loved one and that everyone would start
2645000	2646000	really scrutinizing me.
2646000	2654000	Well, but and then and then like, you know, I've I've turned my you talk funny
2654000	2655000	you act weird.
2655000	2659000	You have inappropriate reactions into a fucking gold mine.
2659000	2664000	But on the playground when I was in sixth grade and if some if my wife got
2664000	2669000	murdered, it would be back up to life and death stakes and people going like
2669000	2675000	we still haven't seen Cody for seventy two and people going like like like so
2675000	2676000	here's your 911 call.
2676000	2682000	Like I I I had one grisly encounter with a guy that had a bad accident and I
2682000	2686000	like tripped over his leg and like like and was it was gone and I was like I
2686000	2690000	had something something something clicked inside of me that like sealed off all
2690000	2693000	kind of processing of the of the viscera.
2693000	2694000	Thank God.
2694000	2699000	Because I if I can't watch I have to go like this when people shoot up in
2699000	2700000	Tarantino movies.
2700000	2705000	I I can't I can't stand the Dan Aykroyd Julia Childs sketch with you where he
2705000	2706000	cuts his finger.
2706000	2707000	I can't.
2707000	2709000	And when I think about it, I get nauseous.
2709000	2712000	When I give blood, I have to turn my head and they always have to ask if I'm okay
2712000	2714000	because I like get lightheaded.
2714000	2719000	But but I tripped over a guy's, you know, severed leg and I I didn't save his life
2719000	2720000	or anything.
2720000	2723000	But I I was James Bond until the paramedics got there.
2723000	2724000	I didn't do anything right.
2724000	2727000	But I was like I didn't I didn't faint or puke.
2727000	2728000	Right.
2728000	2732000	My point was that like like if I'm calling 911 because if you if you and I
2732000	2736000	are together and you like a belt flies through the window wraps around your
2736000	2739000	neck and kills you and and I hear tires screeching.
2739000	2743000	I feel like I'm going to I'm going to like get the belt and then do your purple
2743000	2746000	and then I'm going to I'm going to sound the recordings going to be me going like
2746000	2747000	yeah.
2747000	2752000	I was drinking with my friend and a belt wrapped around her neck and she's dead.
2752000	2754000	And you should hurry.
2754000	2755000	So you should hurry, sir.
2755000	2756000	What's going on?
2756000	2757000	Where are you?
2757000	2760000	You should hurry up and arrest me because I'm going to the big house.
2760000	2765000	And they and they and it's not it's never like a one for one relationship between
2765000	2768000	people that are that behave that way in.
2768000	2771000	Well, I think they're starting to realize that now that whole thing of like he
2771000	2772000	didn't react correctly.
2772000	2775000	He was very cold or women get that all the time.
2775000	2779000	They if it's some mother whose child died, she must have done it because she wasn't
2779000	2780000	crying in public.
2780000	2784000	I just heard the theory that a lot of times the lawyers that they give you sedatives
2784000	2788000	and that's because they don't want you overreacting to the police or to the
2788000	2790000	prosecutors or whatever.
2790000	2792000	And then they can't they can't anticipate what the press does.
2792000	2793000	I've never heard.
2793000	2794000	I've never heard.
2794000	2797000	And that's why they're not relying on witness testimony as much because it's so
2797000	2800000	fucking flawed from our memory to the way we react is like so different from person
2800000	2801000	to person.
2801000	2802000	There's no way to read into that stuff.
2802000	2807000	What's your what's your guys's most like if you had to pick one like murder
2807000	2813000	mystery trial or thing that is the most like the one that you fascinate on the
2813000	2814000	most.
2814000	2815000	One, two, three.
2815000	2816000	John.
2816000	2819000	Oh, wait, did you say John?
2819000	2820000	And John Wayne?
2820000	2821000	At the same time.
2821000	2823000	We are so close.
2823000	2824000	John.
2824000	2825000	John.
2825000	2826000	That little drunk.
2826000	2829000	He's the bass player for Marilyn Manson.
2829000	2830000	John.
2830000	2837000	I heard it was Jane Cook's absence that made him commit all those crimes.
2837000	2841000	You can read all about it on mansplaining a joke I came up with.
2841000	2844000	That's Marilyn Manson's blog.
2844000	2847000	I thought it was pretty funny.
2847000	2849000	Did you have something to do with it?
2849000	2850000	Did I have something to do with it?
2850000	2851000	With naming it.
2851000	2853000	I wrote the I wrote the joke.
2853000	2854000	I came up with it.
2854000	2855000	I thought you were saying.
2855000	2856000	Just leave it.
2856000	2857000	Georgia.
2857000	2858000	Georgia.
2858000	2860000	You are John Bonnet.
2860000	2862000	Man, I am fascinated.
2862000	2863000	Didn't that get back in the news?
2863000	2864000	Didn't that come back up recently?
2864000	2865000	Because it's the anniversary.
2865000	2869000	Yeah, there's about to be a big, you know, a documentary series.
2869000	2871000	A docu-series about it.
2871000	2873000	Are there new revelations in the John Bonnet?
2873000	2874000	Supposedly.
2874000	2877000	They like to promise that in the promos, as we all know.
2877000	2881000	Again, you have to wait until the very end to find out that nothing's happening.
2881000	2882000	We don't know anything.
2882000	2883000	Always.
2883000	2884000	Which I love.
2884000	2887000	It's not knowing because it's so much like my thing is like I'm really into cold cases
2887000	2892000	because then you don't find out it's some fucking like dick lick, like drug addict who killed her.
2892000	2896000	It's like a bigger fucking mystery that it's like maybe it's this like diabolical thing
2896000	2901000	instead of it's like, no, this fucking asshole got drunk and killed this woman who was like
2901000	2902000	better than him.
2902000	2904000	And he took it away, you know, instead of like.
2904000	2909000	So I like I like I hate when it's I hate when it's like like a cold case.
2909000	2916000	And I love when it's a police officer and an investigator that finds out, oh shit, like
2916000	2918000	I just never gave up on this.
2918000	2921000	And then one day like I went back through all this shit and I found stuff.
2921000	2924000	A lot of it now is, oh, now we have modern DNA stuff.
2924000	2925000	But we found the thing.
2925000	2929000	But I like what someone goes, no, no one ever looked at this one statement.
2929000	2930000	It was this guy.
2930000	2931000	Yeah.
2931000	2932000	I love that stuff.
2932000	2937000	And you start thinking about how often it must happen because for so long before there
2937000	2941000	were computers or whatever and it was just up to whatever if a policeman was thorough.
2941000	2942000	Yeah.
2942000	2943000	Then things would all get checked.
2943000	2946000	And if someone was a little sloppy for whatever reason.
2946000	2948000	Or the policeman didn't have taught like he was on.
2948000	2950000	He was the only fucking detective in that like unit.
2950000	2954000	And the other thing is like DNA evidence isn't fucking final anymore.
2954000	2959000	Like there was there was some case in Michigan and they like tested the DNA on this like
2959000	2960000	cold case and on her jacket.
2960000	2966000	And the DNA they found on the jacket was from a perpetrator who was in prison but was four
2966000	2968000	years old when the time the crime took place.
2968000	2969000	So like clearly.
2969000	2970000	Did he borrow her jacket?
2970000	2972000	He did not borrow a jacket.
2972000	2974000	It's just fucking cloth.
2974000	2976000	She was a god damn it.
2976000	2979000	What do you what do you call the guy that does the bris?
2979000	2980000	Oh.
2980000	2981000	A moil.
2981000	2982000	She was a moil.
2982000	2983000	She was a moil.
2983000	2984000	And wore that jacket.
2984000	2988000	Do you guys know about the Black Dahlia murder?
2988000	2989000	Yeah.
2989000	2993000	Like you know the house on Franklin where the is it Frank Lloyd Wright or Lloyd Wright?
2993000	2994000	Yes.
2994000	2997000	I just did something at that house where I got to go to the house for the first time.
2997000	2998000	You went in there?
2998000	3000000	And so I was like shooting some stupid thing and went down.
3000000	3001000	There's a secret room.
3001000	3002000	Did you get a secret room?
3002000	3003000	Yeah.
3003000	3004000	I found out with a secret room and.
3004000	3005000	Wait did you see the secret room?
3005000	3007000	Well it's it's walled off now I think.
3007000	3012000	But but there and there's a there's a guy on the other side of the wall he's going like
3012000	3013000	I did it.
3013000	3014000	I did it.
3014000	3015000	It was me.
3015000	3016000	I killed the Black Dahlia see.
3016000	3017000	You never know who I am.
3017000	3020000	I'm the bee's knees for killing the Black Dahlia.
3020000	3021000	It's very authentic.
3021000	3023000	You can tell he hasn't been out of there.
3023000	3026000	The guy that owned that house was I believe a physician a doctor.
3026000	3027000	He raped his daughter.
3027000	3028000	He was a fucking creep.
3028000	3029000	Yeah.
3029000	3030000	His son thought he was the killer.
3030000	3031000	And supposedly did it.
3031000	3032000	But then he died.
3032000	3033000	He's not.
3033000	3034000	We'll never know.
3034000	3035000	He's not.
3035000	3036000	He's not the killer.
3036000	3037000	Absolutely not.
3037000	3039000	But supposedly they brought in when they were trying to resell Frank Lloyd Wright's awesome
3039000	3040000	house.
3040000	3043000	They're on Franklin and whatever it is Winonaish or whatever.
3043000	3044000	Yeah.
3044000	3047000	That they brought cadaver dogs in and they all hit on the same room.
3047000	3048000	Oh I love it.
3048000	3049000	And.
3049000	3050000	Wait but it wasn't the secret room.
3050000	3051000	What was the different room?
3051000	3053000	I was aware of the secret room would have been.
3053000	3056000	He also performed abortion like secret abortions in that room.
3056000	3057000	Oh.
3057000	3058000	That's why they thought he was attached.
3058000	3059000	Did they just hit on dead babies down there?
3059000	3060000	Well I mean.
3060000	3061000	Did I go?
3061000	3062000	Did I go somewhere dark?
3062000	3063000	Well you didn't do it.
3063000	3064000	She's not the secret abortionist.
3064000	3065000	You guys have a murder show.
3065000	3067000	That was too much.
3067000	3071000	All right so but Karen you're a John Wayne Gacy guy you said.
3071000	3076000	John Wayne Gacy the I saw it's so funny because there's no way this was from my grammar school
3076000	3080360	but I have this memory of being in the library of my grammar school and opening up a book
3080360	3082800	about John Wayne Gacy and I went to Catholic school.
3082800	3085240	So there's no fucking way I was in school.
3085240	3090360	But I was somewhere and I opened up a book about John Wayne Gacy and there was an illustrated
3090360	3096520	drawing of where the bodies were in that in the house.
3096520	3099360	And someone goes oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.
3099360	3102360	That was a self loving neurologist from a mirror.
3102360	3103360	Oh that's right.
3103360	3106240	She's just catching up.
3106240	3112200	There were so many drawings and it was like underneath it said there were 37 boys or how
3112200	3118160	I can if that's the correct total but somewhere around in the 30s and it said found the way
3118160	3121760	they explained it in the house but I thought it meant in the walls.
3121760	3127080	And then the way it was drawn it was like it looked like there were people in the walls.
3127080	3129120	I literally stared at the picture for 10 minutes.
3129120	3134680	I was just like and before that point in my life I thought everybody was living the exact
3134680	3135880	same life I was living.
3135880	3138640	I thought everybody was middle middle class.
3138640	3141360	I thought everybody had two parents in their house.
3141360	3144880	Like I had no fucking clue what the real world was like at all.
3144880	3148760	So it was this real amazing.
3148760	3152920	It was like an epiphany but the scary version of an epiphany because I was suddenly was
3152920	3157920	like there are grown men out there that will kill boys and put them in the walls of his
3157920	3158920	house.
3158920	3162520	But you think about if you hide enough boys in the walls think of the savings on heating
3162520	3164520	costs.
3164520	3167800	They are perfect because they have a vacuum inside of them.
3167800	3169800	Jeff.
3169800	3182960	When you fixate on the John Wayne Gacy murders so you've probably fixated that on the timelines
3182960	3183960	of that.
3183960	3185520	Like he's still alive right?
3185520	3188720	No John Wayne Gacy he died in jail.
3188720	3194800	But after a long while of over and over it's like a rare case of like a fountain of knowledge
3194800	3198880	about John Wayne Gacy because he just hung out and kept answering questions like why
3198880	3202760	and then what and then what and I've read some of that stuff.
3202760	3207620	So when you're reading those accounts where it's like he just kept bringing boys back
3207620	3211680	to his house and then it was like to talk about magic and then do you want to watch
3211680	3212680	it.
3212680	3214200	The big thing was like the rope trick.
3214200	3215200	I want to show you the rope trick.
3215200	3216200	The hand cuff trick.
3216200	3217960	Oh my god I don't know this.
3217960	3224800	When you're hearing that story that for me is like I'm pouring over that and I'm like
3224800	3233000	I don't know I am thinking of I'm thinking of I think I'm getting a glimpse of like victim
3233000	3241120	and murderer like maybe it's because the murderer is the victim is a boy maybe.
3241120	3247680	But I also maybe that's just like do you detect a difference there because the victims are
3248000	3249440	a different gender.
3249440	3250440	I don't think so.
3250440	3253040	Because that would be valuable data in my dumb thesis from earlier.
3253040	3258880	Yeah well I guess I did I guess in this case I didn't just because they I knew they kept
3258880	3266200	using the word boy so it felt like my school you know what I mean it felt like a man murdered
3266200	3271120	boys that would be my age and put them in his house and like what the fuck are we talking
3271120	3272120	about right now.
3272120	3274920	It was like getting secret documents you know what I mean but it was just like this book
3274920	3281120	so and but also what I immediately also went into is like that moment where he's it's the
3281120	3285160	guy that owns the construction company who says hey you did good work today come on I'll
3285160	3288920	buy you a beer come over to my house we have a whole beer and all the guys come you come
3288920	3290280	on you'll have a great time.
3290280	3293760	So you fucking go because you're 16 and you're broke and you want to get drunk who gives
3293760	3296360	a shit afterwards you're gonna go to a concert whatever.
3296360	3301800	Oh my god the places I went when I was 20 with dudes three times my age that I looked
3301800	3308360	up to yeah always and then when you're when you're there in John Wayne Gacy's den it goes
3308360	3313800	from super fun cool chill everyone's drunk to let me do the handcuff trick and suddenly
3313800	3319800	you're handcuffed and then the bottom fucking drops out and reality switches and it turns
3319800	3326120	into a nightmare but it's still a reality like that is the area that I fixate on and
3326120	3328640	can't get over.
3329280	3332680	You guys talked about we started watching the show because you talked about on your
3332680	3345320	podcast I Survived like have you guys seen the show fuck me like like oh my god the woman
3345320	3351480	who there's an episode that like yeah that we went through we looked for it first was
3351480	3356920	it Mary Vincent yeah was it that's the hitchhiker that yeah I like like I mean I don't even
3356920	3362240	know why I brought it I just wanted to I because so that's a person that survived
3362240	3367240	so when you guys are consuming that it's like they're sitting these people they're the victims
3367240	3371440	and they're they survived and then they're talking into the camera and they're taking
3371440	3380120	you through every granular detail of an experience that absolutely should have definitely they
3380120	3386800	should not be telling and and so what and what are we feeling when we're watching that
3386800	3392840	I will tell you this and sorry but this my sister forced me to watch I Survived one time
3392840	3395800	and I was like I don't want to watch this I don't want to get involved in this do not
3395800	3399640	make me and she was like come on no I swear to god you'll love it and basically made me
3399640	3404680	I was at her house so I couldn't change the channel and she forced me to watch it and
3405160	3411320	the difference between I Survived and all of those other shows is it is the survivor talking
3411320	3417040	slightly off-camera to you saying here's what happened to me and as upsetting as it is and
3417040	3422320	insane as it is and there's all kinds of it's not all just these murder attempts or hideous
3422320	3426020	things there's also like there's always some fucking Australian that's like I hiked too
3426020	3431040	far up in the mountains yeah my girlfriend and I are absolutely I mean that's yeah it's
3431040	3435280	like that's that when you're alone and you're watching this stuff it brings the is it is
3435280	3439080	it toxins are leeching to your surface because you're like you know we're just we're just
3439080	3443560	again like it became the running joke we're like mocking the Australian that survived a forest fire
3443560	3449680	like there's a lady with her arms and legs cut off that guy chose to go fucking hiking when this
3449680	3452520	chicks like I was walking on the sidewalk and you're like well that didn't mix you know you
3452520	3458320	weren't like fucking or hitchhiking in the 70s which is like yeah clearly they thought it was
3458320	3462200	like driving they thought it was totally but you know the Australian girl that survived a forest
3462200	3466760	fire like they pulled up in their van and we're like what you survived let's talk about it and
3466760	3472160	she's like really oh okay which episode should we put her in they fucking hung her out to dry
3472160	3479600	well the other thing that I love that that show to me the total lack of exploitation is those
3479600	3485600	survivors are telling their own story and almost every time at the end it's some badass woman who's
3485600	3490440	like and then he shot me in the head three times and you're like I'm sorry what the fuck is happening
3490440	3496400	and it's a person these these people all different types of people surviving gunshots to the head
3496400	3502000	or being brutally fucking raped and dumped into a ditch or whatever it is and they're sitting there
3502000	3506280	as a whole person telling you what happened to them and saying like I know you didn't mean it
3506280	3511680	this way but like giving voice to a story that nobody wants to hear and being like that's my
3511680	3516440	experience that's why I walk up can you then they like show the fucking scar on their neck or
3516440	3522120	whatever it is and at the end usually they've set up some foundation to help victims almost every
3522120	3527440	time it's some badass woman who's like and now I run the crisis center for all the women
3527440	3537440	that's right well I think that's so much of the murder thing that I'm fascinated by and I think
3537440	3544040	women too because it's like we're so empathetic and like overly so that like we see this we see
3544040	3551280	like these murders and like murders about to happen it could happen anytime it could happen
3551280	3556200	anytime I'm on your side no we get it we it makes perfect sense we understand we're saying
3556200	3562920	you're saying protect yes stop killing women all the time all right she's pleased she's
3562920	3570600	pleased I'm sorry to laugh out loud she's pleased to Jeff please stop killing women I think look yes
3570600	3576860	am I still under indictment yes but I mean it's I mean I went golfing recently with my friend
3576860	3583240	Kato Kaitlyn Dan's a friend we've this is not a joke I've known we've known Kato for a long long
3583240	3591800	time he is the nicest guy the most lovely sweetest pleasantest this this goofiest funniest like he's
3591880	3597240	so much fun to be around he was in the Simpsons and but he was in the Simpsons he was in the
3597240	3601720	Simpsons but uh well I've known him for a good long time and we sat down one time I think maybe
3601720	3605320	we talked about in the show before we sat down and just like he told me the whole story about
3605320	3613720	everything that he knew what happened that day when the murders happened oh Jay did it what what
3614440	3623160	spoilers but so if you want I feel like I told the story but I can tell you what he told me but
3623160	3627240	we were out hanging out but the other day we were out just like golfing I haven't seen him in like a
3627240	3633000	year or two and I haven't golfed I'm a terrible golfer I suck at golfing and I had an old ratty
3633000	3637800	ass golf club with holes in it it was a bit of my like thing and look at this thing it's also one of
3637800	3644200	my golf clubs had been in the car for a while so that it was kind of like almost like tar coming
3644200	3650840	off of the grip so I turned all black and he made the joke to cut everybody off at the pass like I
3650840	3655320	just don't leave it on the ground so somebody finds that glass I'm like what and everybody laughed
3655320	3660600	I'm like oh right the glove I and he goes Jeff every time I go golfing somebody does that joke
3662040	3665960	he'll be out golfing and someone will take the glove off throw it like in a bush and go hey oh
3666120	3672280	look at that glove over there he says every day of his life for the last 15 20 years however long
3672280	3678840	it's been when I first met and it had been about 12 years I think since the the murder 10 he said
3678840	3683880	every single day somebody comes up and says some horrible shit yeah and the thing is he was friends
3683880	3689080	with Nicole and and he was kind of like this babysitter to the kids because he was like you
3689080	3693480	know he was just a goofball baseball playing surfing dude he's like the guy that was out in
3693480	3699560	the guest house I mean like that to be in that scenario that he was in is so it's like one of
3699560	3703640	those things were just then suddenly that's your whole life he didn't want to be a witness he didn't
3703640	3708120	know shit he and he told me like he's like he was I was hanging out of my in the guest house and
3708120	3712360	OJ never came down to the back house and never spoke to him but he also felt like OJ would
3712360	3717480	follow him around he didn't know that for sure but he felt like like he OJ was having people tail him
3717480	3722600	because he was super jealous of Nicole and and Kato was never fucking Nicole Nicole was doing her
3722600	3727160	own thing but Kato if you've ever seen him like I've been around him like at parties like at you
3727160	3732520	know 4th of July parties and stuff like that and he is like this awesome babysitter like the kids
3732520	3736920	love him and he's got the energy of a toddler and he just runs around and piggyback rides and he is
3736920	3741480	the the best he got he was portrayed very well in the in the Simpsons I disagree because they
3741480	3747400	may know god no he no I mean I actually broke my heart because having met him I was like oh man
3747400	3750760	that's a bummer I just think he seemed like he seemed like a kind person who didn't have any
3751000	3755400	but they still kind of bimboized him in a way that he guy like he wasn't like he wanted nothing to
3755400	3759880	do with it and his nervous tension of being up there and not knowing anything he came off like
3759880	3764920	he was just being giggly and and but it was that generation's first Hollywood murder I mean we
3764920	3770680	hadn't had a black dolly or anything and now we had cameras and and there was a racial component
3770680	3778520	but it was above all it was a celebrity murder yeah and and he represented this new thing it was
3778520	3783480	like this amazing thing he had a mullet and uh and he was living in the guest house it was like
3783480	3791240	it was the midwest's like uh introduction to uh yeah and he's from Milwaukee like he's uh
3791240	3796520	yes that was a big part of it too like in Milwaukee birthplace of Jeffrey Dahmer like wait wait we
3796520	3800440	yeah we were I guess we had a personal stake in the OJ think too because we're like oh that actor
3800440	3805880	sting in the guest house anyways um so let's go I want to go to like bedrock with just with the
3805880	3812040	because we're talking about like true crime um the the grizzly murders um uh I don't even know
3812040	3818680	what the statistics are I'm gonna assume 99.9 percent the victims are women the the the perpetrators
3818680	3827720	are are are are men uh the the um do we what you guys consuming this like on a junky level
3827720	3834840	you already stumbled into the class system thing and uh the the where but you know it's like
3834840	3839800	blonde and blue eyes and it's like it yeah like we heard what you said you stumbled into that
3839800	3846200	have you have you reached any conclusions or had any changes of heart or new affirmations of like
3846200	3852280	and I'm not even sure how to pose the question like do we do we are we doing things from the
3852280	3861240	world of the sane to indoctrinate women into like a victim culture like are we are we are we all
3861240	3866680	participant in some kind of like are we is is that is that is that a real thing do we are we
3866680	3873000	somehow I mean I think there's a way that that could be true in some general in some general
3873000	3879960	swaths I'm definitely not educated enough to speak on this except for my own alligator we tend to
3879960	3885480	blame the kid that's right like we tend to figure out why it's not that bad an alligator and not
3885480	3889800	that bad of a corporation and I'm sorry but I don't know I'm trying to be genome Chomsky about it but
3889800	3895560	that we have a bias there if somebody if if somebody gets killed by a lawn jar we tend to
3895560	3900600	side with the lawn jar like we go especially if it means lawn jars get recalled we go like oh
3900600	3905960	another fucking piece of apple pie in americana recall but wait wait sorry sorry what are you
3905960	3912360	talking about I'm talking about lawn jars my brother lawn jars or a deadly weapon that you
3912360	3918360	used to be able to play with oh lawn jars your charts with a j with a j yeah you could throw
3918440	3923320	javelin at your friends and it would land in somebody's throat and it would stab a child
3923320	3928680	so they did two rounds of these they did lawn jars and then lawn darts and we were like we
3928680	3934280	gotta stop with lawn it was like if you played cornhole the beanbag I know all about lawn
3934280	3941000	darts I did not know about lawn jars yeah that's crazy 1980 when were you born 1980 they were giant
3941000	3947480	lead poles with plastic fins on them that that that were designed for air time and for penetrating
3947480	3952680	the human skull right so that's so anyways we tend to side with the victim or tend to side
3952680	3957560	against the victim so I think that it's even before you get into gender politics it's like
3957560	3962920	the pot the the potential for bias exists and it's like where is where is it coming from and
3962920	3968360	what is it sorry then personally I think it's the journalism I think it's what story sells
3968360	3974280	and what's the most exciting you have a child that's in in beauty pageants as a six-year-old
3974280	3981080	dressed up as a 35-year-old secretary and she is murdered we've been talking about it for 20
3981080	3985960	years and that's because that is the ultimate that the news can bring that up and sell two
3985960	3991960	million magazines easy you see it constantly it's like in touch once a month has a jompanay story
3991960	3995800	and it's the oldest story there is part of the fascination with that it is that it was a fucking
3995800	4001640	rich a rich white family and so like they they're part of the reason it's never been solved and was
4001640	4005800	such a big deal is because those people got away with it because they were a rich white family
4005800	4012280	you know within that within all certainly if it bleeds it leads while we're leading the bleeding
4012280	4019800	um are we also lacing everything with some kind of fiber optic cable that sends the message
4019800	4027640	that you know well she left her house yeah I think and isn't that doesn't it just come back to
4027640	4033960	like it's it's a holdover from television as I've always said it's an appliance if you talk
4033960	4038680	to your refrigerator it'll tell you nothing's cold enough and that's not true if you talk to your
4038680	4044040	toaster it'll tell you like all bread should be like crispy and hot and brown and that's not
4044040	4049800	necessarily true I like its attitude but if you if it's just that the television happens to be
4049800	4054680	able to talk to you and like and would and does its job as a plant and the television would tell
4054680	4061160	you not enough people are sitting right in front of me glued to me afraid to ever stop watching me
4061160	4067320	and does that is that and not so much of course a big helping heaping of misogyny that is as old as
4067320	4072360	the the actual world's oldest profession hating women it's it's you can't beat the hours
4073480	4079240	the it but but but that is it is it could be just like a thing it's like maybe we can like
4079240	4086760	break out of it because it's that's really really specifically about a time of a broadcast
4086760	4093160	era thing of like just be afraid to stop watching your tv ladies be afraid to because this lady
4093160	4097320	left when she stopped watching your tv and she got her head cut off what we I think because we're
4097320	4102360	not experts and we're not journalists and we're not like all we can do is like impart our experiences
4102360	4107240	and part of that is like it's not it's so hard to walk the line between victim blaming and telling
4107240	4113080	women like you can tell someone to fuck off before before they fucking talk to you and you
4113080	4117800	can fucking pepper spray someone before they try to talk to you you don't have to be fucking polite
4117800	4122200	and it's and it's this all we could like there's i've been in instances where like i should have
4122200	4126520	fucking been killed or i shouldn't have been so nice and it's all i can do is say my experiences
4126520	4133560	with that which is uh is that women are taught to fucking be polite and smiley and cute and
4133960	4139560	well there's so many there's so many minute by minute repercussions for not being like a perfect
4139560	4143400	little angel that has her perfect social network arranged around her but you're gonna you're gonna
4143400	4149080	get punished for that in ways if you live what's beautiful is first of all we know now television
4149080	4155160	is a dying art and that we know that the children of today are online and they're kind of like making
4155160	4159400	their own they're they're forging their own path so they're not in the same way that i feel like
4159400	4165720	i was anyway taking this stuff in like just whole cloth and just accepting whatever they see where
4165720	4171000	it's like oh yeah i better be scared or whatever there's so many more uh there's such i feel like
4171000	4175880	there's a much more independent thinking when people get on even when it's facebook like on
4175880	4180600	our facebook page people will fight for seven days about something they'll go back and forth
4180600	4185720	and that's because it's the kind of love of the discussion and there really is stuff that gets
4185720	4192200	said and learned i think and i think these days people aren't so maybe maybe women aren't as
4192200	4198200	willing to just be like accepting of that like most people don't the whole idea of like oh it
4198200	4202040	can't be rude or someone's gonna think of a bitch or resting bitch face or any of that stuff it's
4202040	4207720	like well i think that's cool i love resting bitch face i think it's hilarious and i think
4207720	4211400	you can get a lot done with it and resting bitch face comes from years and years of being
4211400	4215080	bombarded with people when you fucking men when you fucking smile at them they think it's
4215080	4218760	an open invitation to talk to you also men are allowed to have resting bitch face at all time
4218760	4224280	and it looks like savoir faire it looks aloof what are you the manager of a bank yeah
4228520	4235560	i'll give you all my money now was he i'm so fascinated i mean i can't get enough of ryan
4235560	4241720	lakti in the news because i love that's colt colbert and trevor noah and everybody is just
4241720	4248600	taking a thousand tons of shit on this this dumb dumb i don't know if he kills somebody i'll wash
4248600	4255400	that forever like if we find out that he ever just like murdered a puppy that'll be news
4255400	4262120	because like he's just so dopey like i i love watching i love watching like entitled rich
4262760	4268360	like protected assholes just get in trouble he won gold medals yeah and he peed on a shell
4268360	4273960	station in brazil and then he didn't have to go on matt lauer and talk about it he could have gone
4273960	4278440	home yeah oh that's that that's that olympic thing i think the only thing i've heard about
4278440	4281880	that is that it was like this hilarious comedy of errors that all had to do with like you were
4281880	4286600	telling me about that yeah it was because a guy he told his mom and then his mom talked to the
4286600	4291560	thing and they followed up on this story he wasn't he didn't report it his mom reported it
4291560	4297080	from america because she thought i don't talk to my parents yeah so you never know what will go
4297080	4302440	wrong it sounds like the guy's just chill but it was like same same relationship with anybody's
4302440	4307480	mom that it's like yeah mom i and made up a lie and then his mom was at the dmv going you know
4307480	4312840	my son's a gold medalist and mooby dooby doo and he didn't want to say he was out cheating on his
4312920	4317480	girlfriend and he was out like banging chicks in brazil and got super drunk and and he should have
4317480	4322200	caught the flight and he peed on a thing and acted like an asshole which i'm sure he's done many many
4322200	4327880	times so have i never told my mom exactly always told her i was at rocky horror pictures and then
4327880	4333800	i came home he told his mom right to bed he made himself to sound like the outlaw josey wales and
4333800	4338120	he's like my son's the outlaw josey wales like he's like he's a hero and then he's like no like you
4338120	4342040	know he was just a drunk douchebag it's fucking hilarious these are kids though right when we
4342040	4347240	think of oh i think he's 30 yeah he's pretty he's pretty old kid by our new definition but
4347240	4353400	the duffer brothers are kids i guess the swimmers he left behind were kids like he was the old guy
4353400	4357960	and then he was like well i got a plan to catch see you dudes later you're gonna get in trouble
4357960	4363720	with everybody in south america i have no details okay yeah so fun though pretty awesome so fun
4365000	4370600	i didn't watch a lick of the olympics i i feel fine i miss him though i i love the olympics
4370600	4374920	i didn't think these olympics would happen i don't know why i didn't think they would happen
4376120	4379240	all the terrible stories that were going to come out and there was only like five of them it was
4379240	4383240	just like the water turned green also did you guys hear that ryan latte almost got murdered
4384760	4388600	i mean shit was crazy down there what about the dude you want to you want to you want to
4388600	4393400	you want to rally around a villain that i'm pretty sure is safe to none of us will go to hell for
4393400	4398040	for for verbally lynching let's do it what was the fucking thing i read one article about it
4398040	4405080	the dude who like did a like uh a grinder sting like it was like and he was like outing
4405080	4409880	like people from different countries like because he was like because he couldn't get into the
4409880	4415640	inner sanctum and like do his expose and how they all fucking party and stuff and so he from outside
4415640	4421160	the walls of that inner sanctum uh was like well what can i do and like i mean this is what i'm
4421160	4427800	hearing but like he made a fake grinder account and was like and then was like uh did uh you know
4427880	4433320	an article that was like about all the dudes that'll that answered his grinder call a bunch of
4433320	4438440	fucking people in countries where like being out is not oh fucking k he's just such including
4438440	4443320	america if you choose not to be out just to interject that yeah i mean that's what journalism
4443320	4447640	is like that's what it's called now so when we're like fucking nancy grace can suck it like that's
4447640	4452840	that's what it is they're ruining it for fucking everyone else i like the olympics because if the
4452840	4457160	u.s women were their own country they would have come in second for gold medals that's how many
4457160	4463800	fucking gold medals the u.s women did i love it i cry every goddamn time also there was a fucking
4463800	4469720	me and my girlfriend were watching the men's synchronized diving all the guys look i mean
4469720	4474120	let's just say they look like hot gay dudes they look like runway model very sane looking and one
4474120	4480760	guy's name was steel johnson which is fucking steel johnson there was a woman named misty hyman
4481160	4486920	uh there were two guys on the german team named butte and folks and they were standing next to
4486920	4491800	it all the time it looked like butt fucks it was fucking great if that doesn't make you want to
4491800	4497320	watch the olympics then maybe you and i aren't friends there was another you worked for ellen
4497320	4502200	for a long time right like like first five years i'm assuming it was an honorable discharge and
4502200	4505960	you you have good things to say about i don't know if we'll go into that on this episode
4506680	4512040	but uh regardless i thought it was did you see the thing where she she posted the or whatever
4512040	4517720	her camp posted the photoshop thing of her riding Usain Bolt yeah and it was like did
4517720	4521640	am i crazy or was she's like this is how i go grocery shopping from now on and people
4521640	4524920	are like you're racist like he's not your mule he's not your donkey like okay so those people
4524920	4530040	are racist right yeah i'm not the crazy one no the joke is he's fast yeah the joke is he's fast
4530040	4534440	like this is this phenomenon of like i mean i guess it's always been around but now you can
4534440	4541320	really look at it and point at it it's like the uh those persons so woke is that they can perceive
4541320	4549320	racism all kinds of places how with an uncanny ability to project it like and extrapolate their
4549320	4554520	proof is that you're arguing it that's it yeah proof is that you're fighting back or saying no i'm
4554520	4561480	not yeah you yeah you're looking at a picture and going like oh i get it you're saying he's a pack
4561480	4567080	animal i i just think that's amazing i thought it's like like i'm gonna i'm gonna now solve
4567080	4573160	racism somewhere else other than myself if donald trump photoshopped himself on top of Usain Bolt
4573160	4578760	then that would be cause for alarm but i think i think i think ellen's safe i think like she's
4578760	4585560	making a joke about like i won't answer for her is it true that you gave her a misty hyman
4585560	4590840	yikes
4593560	4602040	so knowing that we're definitely not into victim blaming uh is there a here's a section called
4602040	4610920	victim blaming is there a list of uh of of things that you guys have are putting together
4611640	4616120	uh when i watch forensic files i'm like you know like jeff and i always say okay so if
4616120	4622120	you're gonna get away with murder have a boat and some and uh yeah the the is do you guys have
4622120	4627400	a list we don't always say that uh we said it once and that was between us don't have a boat
4627400	4631240	and fire a boat do you have a cool friend i don't even think it counts anymore because there's
4631240	4636840	cameras on the boats now and you can't like but but um is there a list of things that you guys
4636840	4642200	started to acquire that are kind of like don'ts for people that would like to stay not murder
4642200	4648520	victims well fucking hitchhiking i mean everyone knows it but you would not believe what went on
4648520	4655960	in the 70s boys and girls were getting murdered there were three freeway killers in los angeles
4655960	4661160	between 1970 and 1980 three different serial killers killing hitchhikers on the freeway
4661160	4668360	so okay so because okay so when hitchhiking was popular and all of the like hitchhiking
4668360	4673800	can kill you urban legends were happening that wasn't just society coming down on something
4673800	4680040	that threatened the automotive industry no that wasn't a scam of any kind and they were
4680040	4686120	urban legends that was like a dangerous thing to be doing for everybody and also is um another
4686120	4692840	kind of like victim uh area that nobody talks about was gay men that that the two um two of the
4692840	4699240	freeway killers were specifically killing picking up and killing gay men and there was uh one i
4699240	4705400	think a reporter that was in orange county that found a file that said like like the the freeway
4705400	4711080	fag killer or something and that's how he put it together that this one person was responsible for
4711080	4715960	killing here and and it was the same person responsible for killing in orange county like
4715960	4720360	nobody gave a shit it is just another one of those things of like victims that don't matter well
4720360	4724600	it's like calling when you when you're like you know this this this guy is killing prostitutes
4724600	4728360	instead of saying this guy is killing women which is like what's really happening people just
4728360	4731960	immediately don't give a shit if it's the word prostitutes why are they fucking using it that's
4731960	4738280	the ultimate she asked for it so don't hitchhike don't be gay i mean yes don't be a sex worker
4738280	4746040	if you're gay be careful like be more carefuler it's like i i i like i bet like the main pockets
4746040	4753160	of serial killers is like washington states oh pacific northwest yeah i mean it's a i was just
4753160	4759320	i was just up there and they have these little um roadside um like that's where all the serial
4759320	4763400	killers come from they're all born right they either do all their killing there or they're all
4764280	4768920	bored yeah exactly and they all move along or go somewhere else and do it yeah but there's
4768920	4773160	there's these little coffee shop places where one girl works there and she's like it's a bikini
4773160	4778120	coffee place yes or lingerie coffee place and all it's in the middle of the countryside
4778120	4783000	and and everyone that pulls up is dudes in trucks with guns on the racks and stuff like that like
4783000	4788360	you live in the capital of serial killers and like you're letting women just work alone in the middle
4788440	4793720	see that's the problem go ahead well just if those women had guns too it'd all work out let
4793720	4801560	the good girls and bikinis are we gonna test this theory i hope they do we have until everybody has
4801560	4805880	a gun and we see if all the killing stops so we all got guns up here are you guys ready
4807800	4812200	uh i just i think it's it's just so fucking it pisses me off and it's so unfair and it will never
4812200	4817720	change that like i can't go for a fucking walk at night without like because i weigh and i'm smaller
4817800	4822440	than a fucking dude who just feels like who's like was raised badly and hit his head as a kid and he
4822440	4826680	wants to fucking murder people what's crazy about that is i just i have to imagine that like probably
4826680	4830920	because you maybe have like a fist full of keys in your pocket or something because of like what
4830920	4835560	but i have to imagine that if you and i got into a fight i don't even know i mean like like i
4835560	4840360	that's the thing i was like like i i get your neck let's double the crime let's find out let's
4840360	4848840	find out like i'm not taking ladies gentlemen in this corner say it's an extra crime that it's
4848840	4854280	like the idea that if you're window shopping for a victim it's like like it's kind of out it
4854280	4860200	outrages me that i'm not an option because i'm a six foot nerd like like like i'm such an easy kill
4860200	4865640	like like and i i i want to have that and i think part of part and i would totally kill you
4865640	4874280	oh and then happy birthday i don't like i don't like having my underdog status taken away from me
4875080	4882680	they win it the thing is that's how gamergate started yeah that was that was my reenactment
4882680	4889640	that was my masterpiece theater i was already a nerd what's going on here they're playing
4889640	4894360	video games no matter no matter how low status are small or whatever you think you are as a guy
4894360	4897960	you've never had to worry about being an elevator you've never had to worry about walking through a
4897960	4903000	parking structure you just don't i mean like in certain neighborhoods i might get jumped here
4903000	4908120	but i'm not i'm not gonna get sexually assaulted well now let's add let's go let's go deeper and
4908120	4914680	sadder and and and and add black black woman if you're a black woman so so and you guys mention
4914680	4920760	it so like the most if you're like uh if you're a niche like you're into murder you know about
4920760	4924040	what's his name sleepy head the sleeper sleeper cream sleeper cream sleeper
4926360	4931800	that little bear from the motel that's that's how i take things back i try to give him cute names
4931800	4938280	yeah that's that helps little sleepy pants it's a coping mac he thought he was a badass but uh i
4938280	4946120	call him pajama man and he's like going um the we know about that i watched that documentary and
4946120	4950040	it was like it's fucking profound and it's profound in a sad way like if you watch an
4950040	4954520	informed documentary about drug policy or something like that like if you're in the market
4954520	4960520	for white guilt and uh i mean your shopping cart is full already but uh like if you i like like
4960520	4966200	if you if you want to really like like like fill that fucker up like that documentary because it's
4966200	4971560	just every frame of it from beginning to end is just shining a flashlight on a spot that has no
4971560	4977640	flashlight ever no no camera trained on it nothing like oh do you want to be the most prolific most
4977640	4983480	successful serial killer in the world just live in this neighborhood and kill this demographic
4983480	4988440	it's called living in a or it's called being a high what is it called high risk high risk
4988440	4992760	you're a high risk demographic so that's why when they when you kill prostitutes and drug dealers
4992760	4998600	and drug addicts and you're a sex worker a sex worker excuse me it's because it's because quote
4998600	5003240	and this is why they don't really worry about it is you're a high risk victim and so it's your
5003240	5007640	fucking somehow it's your fault and so we're both what i think we're all watching uh the night of
5007640	5013640	and it is your last episode tonight tonight don't say anything oh yeah i'm so scared uh john
5013640	5018520	tutorial has a little monologue in there when he's talking to his like little protégé and uh um
5018520	5024440	he he mentions but it culminates in like urban women urban women like like they're they're like
5024440	5029320	they're like a lotus leaf like they're they're why would that be i mean because he he rambles
5029320	5033960	through i'm assuming that that is somehow based in some kind of reality why would you want black
5033960	5040200	women on your jury if if they are the most at risk if they are the most like is there is there a
5040200	5048040	horrible like is is there anything behind that wheel of fortune the letter because he was saying
5048040	5052760	you do want black women on your jury that's what that's what the the the thesis of his monologue
5052760	5058200	was yes and he didn't it didn't really i don't know if that was based on anything oh i don't i
5058200	5063640	i'm scared to incriminate myself so i don't like i don't know what yeah well okay i mean i
5063640	5069000	guess maybe if i was gonna if i was gonna speculate and get which would be like podcast
5069000	5073640	suicide but it was like i guess i would be trying to get into the area of like again is this like
5073640	5078760	is it is there a victim is there a victim signal sent through media you know it's like you deserve
5078760	5083560	it you deserve it you deserve it and is that so fucking like could that be actually so effective
5083560	5087320	that it would carry over into your outside watching television life and into everything
5087400	5093000	that you do like can you can you really just but i think that that it goes to the individual
5093000	5098200	because there's so many people even in that grim sleeper documentary that fucking woman pam he drove
5098200	5103560	around with was such a badass and she was she had lived the life she knew that whole neighborhood
5103560	5109640	she knew the guy i think she had been his victim right like it was it was an amazing example of
5109640	5116120	like i think that the storyline might be victim but i don't think the reality for the average
5116120	5120120	woman is victim and i think that's kind of the i think that's the thing that's bubbling up in all
5120120	5124840	of this is like now that everybody has more of a voice on the internet and people get to kind of
5124840	5129480	say their shit yes there's fighting yes there's gamer gate yes people there are people who want
5129480	5135240	to hate other they want to other people so that they can get away from themselves but ultimately
5135240	5140360	what's coming up out of all of this is strength and a voice and people that are watching other
5140360	5145400	people speak for themselves and then maybe they didn't have a strong mother or a strong father
5145400	5149240	maybe they didn't have any good example but they're watching people online going yeah that's
5149240	5154120	how i feel yeah that's fuck this shit like i don't have to do what i was maybe you had a mother who
5154120	5158680	raised you to be like you be polite no matter what you still are an individual that can make
5158680	5165640	that decision for yourself well i mean yeah we get it that's that's really it at the end of the day
5166440	5171160	and it's like and so we there can be evolution i think because of the way
5171960	5178040	uh kind of the internet is and just kind of the way people are connected you have neuroplasticity
5178040	5183640	my therapist says i can i can be a douchebag at 27 when i'm talking to you and like i can i can i
5183640	5191320	can slowly like force myself to think differently it's actually possible giraffes can't do it they
5191320	5197240	can't do it but i mean that that's the thing is you can see course correction online and people
5197240	5203560	are slowly i think slowly learning that you can fuck up badly and still go sorry i was wrong you
5203560	5207880	can you and oftentimes people do it because they write a think piece or they do whatever but it's
5207880	5212520	like going it's like that lindy west story where the guy was harassing her to the point where he
5212520	5218600	was emailing her asking her what he if he think if she thought her dead father was ashamed of her
5218600	5225000	some really intense really personal trolling she called him on the phone and said hey i found out
5225000	5230520	it's you why did you do this and he had this whole thing of like i'm so sorry and like it's that
5230520	5235480	thing of like internet trolls that's just as real as the internet and the moment and the time that's
5235480	5239640	taking place there's a real human being on the other side of that there's real human beings on
5239640	5244920	the other side of all of these things and i think people are slowly starting to learn that and at
5244920	5250760	first it takes the form of something that feels dehumanizing to the wrong people at the wrong time
5250840	5255480	i think one of the big ironies is you have the spock demographic let's i'll i'll claim
5255480	5263240	ambassadorship of the i'll just go ahead and say white privileged uh uh spectra me uh so i can like
5263240	5268280	like like always felt like an underdog always very prideful about the fact that he always knew
5268280	5273000	how the systems worked and why they were unfair and all these things suddenly being told oh you
5273000	5277320	don't know nothing it's hard being this it's hard being that you have this weird impulse where
5277320	5281560	you're like well wait a minute logic should rule the day it always has for me in spite of getting
5281560	5286520	beat up in gym class logic always prevails so why are you being so illogical about this and then
5286520	5290680	you're hearing somebody go like that's what the fucking person just said to me that is oppressing
5290680	5295160	me you fucking you pig you've asshole you fuck face and you're like well that's not very logical
5295160	5301080	meet meet meet and that's what's happening right now is these like as this water table rises but
5301080	5307400	i do i i think i'm hearing an optimistic message here and i share it like i i feel i go through
5307400	5313400	these funks where i'm like we're just fucked we're so fucked we're such toxic pigs um but i then we're
5313400	5317880	not i mean partly it's like listening to you talk about murders as my girlfriend and i go off to
5317880	5323400	sleep and it's like you know if murder if murder itself which should just be this horrible thing
5323400	5327480	where road flares are set up and traffic is stopped and people are yelling things out about
5327480	5331880	oj and gloves not fitting it throwing barbie dolls with duct tape on them onto the the ramsays
5331880	5336760	lawn and and everything gets gross around at the scene of a death everything gets toxic everything
5336760	5342840	gets the the it's like the actual putrefication of the corpse is reflected by a societal rot
5342840	5349640	that we all stink with the closer we get to death the more we talk about it but it's it's undone by
5349640	5354920	a podcast where you're hanging out and there's a little bit of coffee and a little bit of chat
5354920	5359240	your guys are friendly and chatting and you're going like there's a little bit of don't go in
5359240	5364040	that house girl and there's a there and there and then a lot of like depth of like what would it
5364040	5369560	feel like to be in that moment and all this stuff if the the listening to stuff like that reminds me
5369560	5374440	that like that's not possible if not for this whole flood like this uh unfortunate metaphor
5374440	5379080	right now for our friends in the in the south sorry the uh well it's true because that's all
5379080	5386680	fear it's all fear it's the fear everything we talk about is managing fear it's dealing with fear
5386680	5391400	if you are dealing with a person online that you fucking hate and you want to tell them how much
5391400	5395960	you hate them that's all well and good and you can do it and you can type it in and it's there
5395960	5402760	forever but at the end of the day it's in you it's your thing and slowly but surely you know
5402760	5406920	it was like we were all in grammar school when the internet started and we're like oh my god they
5406920	5411320	talk bad about me on a fucking you know a page i'm dead forever whatever and then you slowly go
5411320	5416280	oh that was probably a 13 year old in a basement somewhere it's you know what i mean and we're all
5416280	5421880	developing and growing as these conversations are happening at lightning fucking speed
5421880	5429480	and as we do and develop and grow that we're learning to manage ultimately our fear of death
5429480	5434600	and and ultimately it's human connection that makes us happy our fear of each other and our
5435080	5440200	selves yeah yeah like what's your worst nightmare in a conversation the part of the irony is tying
5440200	5444520	it to that if you're a woman walking alone at night and you are bound in by all these rules
5444520	5448440	that you didn't even know you had until it's too late when it's like somebody is creeping you out
5448440	5452840	and it's like you have these instincts kicking in about oh well i don't want to be a bitch if i
5452840	5459000	survive this um the the this there's a similar thing playing out for everybody online because
5459000	5463640	they're all anonymous there's like some of that stuff is getting there's an uplifting like cowardice
5463640	5469080	being revealed because it's like oh you started an account that is exclusively for trolling but
5469080	5474520	when when then fists still start flying and that person will still express some kind of weird
5474520	5479640	defense of some position yeah no matter how much they think they're like just vandalizing like like
5479640	5484520	some kind of group think they're there they get freaked out when you like come at them
5484520	5491160	and so we all get freaked out when we feel unsafe and so it's like okay if the internet
5491160	5497320	is a cesspool of a bunch of cowardice and toxicity could that give way to a Venice that you go okay
5497320	5502280	so let's put some sticks on top of that and and a gift shop over here and make some good
5502280	5507400	fucking art you know like while you're up above the water that's the whole idea it's just like
5507400	5512440	instead of yes that's a reality just like fucking donald trump's tweets every single day are a
5512440	5517960	reality but that does i have friends who are in full fucking panic about donald trump because
5517960	5522200	that's all they see it's all they hear it's all those news networks talk about it's good right
5522200	5527160	it's like it's called a vaccine it's exposing your system to things that and to and to go that's not
5527160	5531720	okay with me the idea that this man thinks that he's going to build a wall is not okay with me
5531720	5536200	it's not okay with me that he says all mexicans are rapists none of this shit's okay and you can't
5536200	5541320	tweet every day as a politician and have that be the reason why you win an election no like like
5541320	5545880	you can't quite the opposite i would say right you can't you it's not just like it's not like
5545880	5550920	starting a mattress store and going on tv and going like my prices are crazy that's right like
5550920	5556520	Duncan trussell's theory on what trump is doing uh which scared the shit out of me and also the
5556520	5560200	part of the reason why like talking about murder makes me feel better even though i have these like
5560200	5564840	fucking crazy issues about being scared of being killed is that when i like when you acknowledge
5564840	5569800	these people that this has happened to and and it's and they're still humans and you can still
5569800	5574360	fucking relive their experience and you it makes you happy for your life a little bit more i feel
5574360	5578440	like it makes me value life and value the fucking experiences i get and that i haven't
5578440	5583320	been murdered yet and how lucky i am and like acknowledging that this happens all the time and
5583320	5588120	it could go like this or you could live to 105 like my grandma and like you just don't have any
5588120	5591640	fucking clue what your experience for control i think i think your grandma's gonna get murdered any
5591640	5600440	day now how dare you oh shit thanks a lot let's look into that uh has that been investigated
5600440	5607480	are you saying you did it i'm just saying i suspect foul play are you guys shifting your
5607480	5612040	focus that you find you said you found out oh this demographic and the the if you're not the
5612040	5618840	grim sleeper but you're still are you are you putting pressure on yourselves to like are you
5618840	5627480	shifting your are you gonna do more episodes about uh about the the less than famous like uh
5627480	5632360	serial killers and victims and george has always done those ones she likes to do like a deep dive
5632360	5637640	and find those those kind of rare ones that people may have never heard of i imagine the fact that
5637640	5644920	they're rare means that there's less software to run on that it's like there's the point is the
5644920	5651320	system is looking at it as a bunch of garbage so it's not every fucking article takes a paragraph
5651320	5657000	from another article and rewrites it so you have to read like 18 of them before you can really pick
5657000	5662760	out the the stuff that that wasn't rewritten in every other article i hate research so much
5664360	5668200	georgia what do you gravitate towards you are you trying to find the off the beaten track ones i
5668200	5674600	love unsolved murders i love there aren't big media sensation ones no like family murders that
5674600	5680200	are just like that they happen in the in 67 and they have a clear fucking like a clear motive and
5680200	5685320	a clear suspect and that suspect is still alive and yet it just hasn't found either the right
5685320	5690280	web sleuth or the right fucking detective to open it back up and it's it's there some shitty
5690280	5694280	like prosecutor in the first yeah and then i talk about and then i say the name of the
5694280	5699800	person who's a suspect and then karen has to say uh just so everyone knows we're not like you have
5699800	5704200	to like have a disclaimer in there because i'm just blaming this person who's like fucking went off
5704200	5710440	still alive we shouldn't talk about it yeah we're doing it again we did the legal dance i've been
5710440	5718200	asked by our producers is this a terrible time to do a me undies ad no it's not uh i mean i i
5718200	5725800	think that in this age of murder and uh i mean whether or not you want to it makes you want to
5725800	5731240	live more or prepare for death as your mother always told you underwear is important
5734040	5739400	i don't know if that's you know okay dna evidence has to go somewhere i would go dry on this one
5739400	5745000	musically you you want to do it dry yeah yeah do it dry do it dry uh
5748040	5755160	did you did you girls know that there is there is a material twice as soft as cotton
5756760	5763400	why no dan uh i was i was i was about to do some dumb metaphor about like victim's throats or
5763400	5767880	something and it doesn't yeah i was gonna undo everything and then i shared my work and you
5767880	5776440	guys punished me for it so who's the villain just like the internet yeah i was honest and i censored
5776440	5782920	myself now i'm gonna do a mass shooting all right after a quick manifesto about my underwear
5786840	5789240	by the time you see this i will have murdered a million people
5789640	5792120	oh i love my undies
5793960	5802440	i love me no me undies are soft yeah they're soft they're made of a space age fabric
5803000	5808520	go back to the part about people's throats people's throats will go oh when they see your underwear
5810360	5817320	if you replace uh cotton which has a horrible legacy of of actual murder with a new synthetic
5817320	5822920	fabric that probably probably the only bad thing that modal ever did that's the new fabric
5822920	5828520	it probably kill you with with comfort yeah or or put like it probably has put lots of people
5828520	5833320	out of a job right if it's able to be made by robots or something but um but who were those
5833320	5839240	people what's that yeah no then they give us money and then we keep yeah dan dan did you know
5839240	5844280	that uh if you go to meandes.com slash hermiton you get 20 off your first order and if you don't
5844280	5848280	like them you get to keep them anyway i know that's the crazy thing i mean i know it's weird
5848280	5854680	you don't even like it gives you underwear doesn't want them back but but but but you you can just
5854680	5860120	keep them you can just exploit the system i i truly do think i mean this is a golden age of
5860120	5864840	of of a podcasting where we're in a sweet spot now five years from now i may have to be more
5864840	5869160	shameful in my advertising because i won't be able to say i'll be like you know what you know
5869160	5876360	what's great is General Electric's new cluster drone uh takes care of those unwannable third world
5876360	5882680	dictators uh from a distance your family can appreciate and passes the savings on to AT&T
5882680	5889560	for uh but but right now i'm just me it's me andes i mean all they do is cradle your balls labia
5889560	5895160	and or combination of both which you are fucking american and entitled to have that's right uh
5895160	5899480	and it's your fucking business too it's called privacy it's different from honesty
5903480	5908920	this is a company that will swath your nethers in fucking like like they're soft they're soft on
5908920	5914600	your nethers they're also soft on murder which i think that that's a problem they well i don't
5914600	5921400	the only reason i want to clarify their position about that they were they were asked do you like
5921400	5927160	murderers and all they said was we believe they are as entitled to comfortable underwear as anyone
5927160	5933320	else right in my opinion that is their corporate position i value that i don't want to wear
5933320	5939960	underwear made by a corporation that that that is dipping their toe in politics i want i want i
5939960	5944840	want them i know they wouldn't win a popularity contest saying it but the truth is my favorite

6279960	6285560	i don't know if they make themselves legally uh kind of a big claim accountable i don't know
6285560	6289720	if that's it's a song so i don't know if they claim parity but if you or someone you know does
6289800	6293000	get killed in those undies uh next pair is free
6297080	6301560	that's actually the part i don't know it's a good deal i'm just spitballing over here
6301560	6305640	spencer what are your thoughts about murder um i'm for it
6308360	6315160	most the time during these two hours certainly yeah during these two hours certainly
6315720	6323640	no it's bad murder is bad you guys and i'm glad that you asked me that question so i could
6323640	6331480	finally tell the audience that i feel that murder is bad no the only thing i could think of during
6331480	6339000	this whole two hours is the fact that uh women feeling safe is bad for me you know women not
6339000	6348360	feeling safe bro oh no what is that a friday inside episode oh whoops go to me undies.com
6348360	6349480	slash hermit town
6355880	6362680	enter the code uh oops i could have got i could see it either way really so i wasn't
6362680	6365560	sure if i was a friday at supernet because i was like i could make either argument
6366360	6373080	uh just something to think about i thought i figured i should bring it up too early
6373080	6377000	that's how that's how we could help women we could we could we could do some psas where we go
6377000	6384440	you know what i think is hot a safe woman but then we say she emanates a certain je ne sais quoi
6384440	6392440	gets this fella ready to propose pepper spray immediately you do the pepper spray ad i'm doing
6392520	6399800	yeah yeah oh man you could do pepper spray ads oh my god it would be a great tie-in to your brand
6399800	6408200	are we okay that's sarcasm no in a general sense we talked about i mean i think we we we we created
6408200	6414040	an uplifting like sunrise that we're looking forward to on the internet in real life like
6414040	6418680	like eight billion people now it's nine billion what is it we're just choking the planet we're
6419480	6426200	like you guys are you know in this crevice where you're breathing oxygen into a pocket that's
6426200	6433480	was carbon dioxide and it feels it's like you're in the darkness but in general should we just go
6433480	6437720	to the moon and colonize with like a couple hundred people that was the premise of this
6437720	6443080	podcast i think it's so fun that we get to watch the fucking the downfall and like it's so exciting
6443080	6447400	like it makes me who's like super fucking gets bummed like this is so cool we get to watch how
6447400	6451800	like this whole thing fucking crumble to the ground and laugh at it like before it gets really
6451800	6456280	awful i'm like 2040 i feel like i mean yeah i'm older than you are but i feel like i timed this
6456280	6463000	just right like i'm gonna i'm gonna watch the shit hit the fan i'll be like i'm 70 fucking
6463000	6467720	yeah is it is it possible we're all paying the price for baby boomers feeling that way
6467720	6472200	that they're kind of like oh man we did the beetles we hit a golf ball in the moon let's fuck up
6472760	6477640	yeah and then we're and then we were like but what about cobain and they're like fuck you
6477640	6482280	fuck him and we're like fine i'm gonna not wash my hair they're like good save the planet
6483400	6486680	i feel like the baby boomers never had the comfort of modal underwear
6489480	6493320	could make all the difference i mean do you know what what do we what do we foresee you're
6493320	6499320	you're intelligent people like you've studied murder in a consumer way like off of wikipedia
6500120	6505480	but community college dropout is there as our species is it i think a lot of us even the
6505480	6512440	optimists among us walk around with the idea are the optimistic idea that well we're headed for a
6512440	6519560	gigantic cataclysmic shift that is going to see a lot of i know but you know what dan i think
6519560	6525480	people have always thought that they always think that great it happens all the time i think if
6525480	6531560	you're plugged into certain messaging that's the message that you'll get but i just here's
6531560	6535560	the thing maybe it's because i have epilepsy i don't have time for all that shit you know what
6535560	6542200	i mean i really don't i'm stoked uh not to get too dark or whatever but like my mom had alzheimer's
6542200	6549480	for 12 years she died in january it fucking sucked for 12 years straight in my family it blew don't
6549480	6556680	worry about it it blew unbelievably badly it was terrible and it's not terrible anymore and so i
6556680	6563000	don't give one single fuck if they every day report that there's an asteroid coming or this or that
6563000	6568600	because i'm like oh my god we're okay again and things are get things are only getting better and
6568600	6574360	that's maybe my ridiculous opinion but i'm literally fighting every day to have that opinion
6574440	6579720	because it's one or you choose it's one or the other well i'd rather die feeling that way with
6579720	6584760	you like right well i'll take a special bulletproof bomb shelter where we can feel that way because
6584760	6589080	that's it's like if the asteroid whatever the asteroid is if the asteroid is donald trump
6589080	6593640	but the asteroid is fucking the zika virus whatever this thing is they want volcanoes
6595400	6598920	super predators age they chupacabra chupacabra
6598920	6606280	they don't talk about the chupacabra anymore that's for a reason pajama man handy dick he's
6606280	6613560	going to be here uh i said pajama man but i mean it's always a thing that's just over the mountain
6613560	6616760	that you should be locking down for it's never been tested every time you get tested we passed
6616760	6621080	the new york the power went out in new york and like it was just like the ice cream melted and
6621080	6625880	ate the ice cream people are good you look at the micro shit and you're like if i look if i stop
6625880	6629160	looking at the fucking internet and i'm like i live in this cute little apartment i have this
6629160	6633640	fucking nice dude that i met i have these great cats like everything is actually fine and then
6633640	6637960	you look at like you take two steps out and look at like fucking trump and shit and life is like
6637960	6645320	ruined it's like it's like newsworthy it's like oh man uh the newlywed couple plays video game
6645320	6651000	about raising a baby while they're a real baby rats in a crib eaten by a cat there is no way
6651480	6657480	to have a headline and no one would click on it but from a general perspective truly the objective
6657480	6665240	empirical scientific headline should be every day eight billion people get through another day
6665240	6671160	having taken back the earth from a merciless god that has had them in the crosshairs
6671160	6677720	since they learned to stop being monkeys yeah that's right like and when those and when those
6677720	6681880	eight million people when it comes down to it yes there's groupthink and yes there's like
6681880	6687320	when people do weird shit en masse but at the end of the day when you're standing on the street and
6687320	6692440	somebody gets hit by a car everybody runs fucking toward the person that's down the it's just human
6692440	6697640	that is cameras out and ready to roll taking it all down but i mean it's called the night crawler
6697640	6704440	spirit we're all gonna make 500 but i but i truly believe that i think that that's the true
6704440	6708600	instinct of people if you've gone you know if you've gone to a certain direction to shut
6708600	6714200	that down that's your choice but that is not common that is not i don't think that's the
6714200	6722120	complete let's rush toward an open like we want to heal we're lucky to be like like all of us here
6722120	6727160	like we we are doing a stupid podcast and do comedy with microphones up here but the fact
6727160	6731400	that a group of people all come here just to sit around in a group of strangers and laugh
6731400	6735560	that's really magnificent it's amazing it really is crazy it says a lot about underwear
6737320	6741640	in the state of it like like like these people are had to hang out for two hours in whatever
6741640	6747640	they left the house in and some of them probably chose cotton from a from a hainz or they didn't
