0	16000	Welcome one and all to Hollywood, California, Mel Daddie comments, Harmon down is now in session.
16000	32000	Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown. You know him. You love him, Dan Harmon.
32000	38000	Thank you so much.
38000	50000	He won the debates. He won. Come on. He's just so good. So facile. He's a people pleaser. He's a verbal wizard.
50000	56000	He grabbed my attention like it was a pussy.
56000	65000	I was asking our guest tonight who works around sexuality a lot to confirm something that I felt.
65000	72000	It's not on topic about that recording, but it also feels like...
72000	78000	Look, guys do talk like that, but only when they're impotent.
78000	83000	That's what I want. You don't talk like that when your dick works.
83000	90000	And for me to say that, it's like, oh, well, yeah, but that makes it worse because it's like you're adding to this thing.
90000	93000	But it's also important. I don't like the idea that that guy...
93000	100000	Because you don't say that to another guy. You could do whatever you want when you start.
100000	106000	You could grab a pussy. That's the top of my list. You wouldn't say that if your wiener worked.
106000	110000	Sean Connery never had to grab anybody by the pussy.
110000	117000	Or tell another guy about it in a trailer. We know you're a star. There's all this evidence here.
117000	122000	What a great meeting of the minds of Billy Bush and Donald Trump is.
122000	128000	There's not a wet vagina and 100 miles from there.
128000	134000	I thought it's deep things and dishonesty further for Billy Bush to be like, I was a different...
135000	142000	Just say what it really was, which is that he's laughing nervously because he can't believe this is...
142000	144000	Why is this guy saying this?
144000	147000	I'm in a bus with Donald Trump and he's being a lunatic and it's hilarious.
147000	150000	Is he truly...
150000	155000	Ideologically, philosophically, the answer is yes. Is he really supposed to in that moment?
155000	161000	So I have to stop you there, sir. And demand that you apologize to the women of America that may be listening to this one day.
162000	165000	Or is he supposed to just go...
167000	171000	I mean the question is, was he going like...
171000	175000	The space work was off there.
177000	180000	Billy Bush.
180000	183000	What I wonder is...
183000	187000	You've worn lots of mics. You've had a mic on.
187000	198000	I do lots of live shows where there's a microphone on you and I try to remember to mute myself if I ever have to go use the restroom or say something flagrantly sexist.
198000	204000	But I don't... They clearly didn't know that they were being recorded because if they did, then they wouldn't have done it.
204000	213000	But I love the fact that there was an engineer who's like, I'm just gonna fucking sit on this thing for 11 years.
214000	225000	Wayne Brady one time was shooting a terrible TV show before I was on Whose Line, before he was on Whose Line called Quick Wits, which is a very ill-fated show on NBC a long time ago.
225000	233000	Wayne Brady went to the bathroom. His mic was hot and he went to go pee, but he was still live in the studio.
233000	239000	And it was rehearsals. There was no audience there, but it was everybody else. It was all like Steve Carell was there.
239000	254000	It was like all these people before they became anybody. And Wayne Brady was peeing and we could just hear zip, pee, and then zippity-doo-dah, zippity-dee, my...
254000	264000	He sang the whole fucking zippity-doo-dah. And we were shitting ourselves. And he came back in and he didn't understand why everybody was so happy.
265000	269000	So the hot mic, give us, and the hot mic, take us away.
270000	282000	To this day, I swear, if you run into an actor from community and they start talking about Chevy Chase, they instinctively start going like this.
282000	291000	Because it was like... If you're talking about anything that could be potentially scandalous to this internet age, it's like you're in your mic, you're hitting the mic.
291000	297000	Every time I'd set, people would go like, oh yeah, and then this morning when he...
297000	306000	And then he started... But I swear, I've seen them in parking lots, like off the clock. It's like, oh, with that. Oh, hey, Joel.
306000	312000	And they come up to me, how have you been? Oh, it's been years. Yeah. I was like, oh, did you hear about the thing?
312000	315000	I was like, what are they doing? Do they have the vapors?
315000	325000	Are they doing a bit or is that instinctive? No, no. I've watched it happen and then both of them realize they were doing it and then start laughing and then explain it to me because I'm not an actor.
325000	330000	So I didn't know what was going on either. I was like, what the hell is it? And then they explained it. I was like, oh my God, that's hilarious.
330000	335000	But it's also scandalous. But I'll...
337000	340000	I think it works like that. You can just knock it out.
341000	347000	I just want to... Halloween's coming up and it's, you know, we'll have another show or two before the actual event.
347000	361000	But right now it's time to... You still have time to stop working on your really hacky basket of deplorables Halloween costume or any other topical wordplay driven costume.
361000	368000	Just get a vinyl cape and some teeth if you're that empty. It's not a holiday for word puzzles.
369000	373000	Wait, why do you... Don't make me... Have you heard of somebody who's making a basket of deplorables costume?
373000	382000	No, Cody predicted that. I was like, we were talking about like, what are the fucking costumes that are going to just make you want to hit people with a bottle?
382000	392000	And it's just always like, it's the people that are like, oh, look what I am. I've talked about this before. Like, I'm Picasso's blue period. You have to put it all together.
393000	407000	Oh, so you are. You never laugh out loud, you know? And then it's like, they want to live in a world where Halloween is like this parlor game where everyone's running around and going like, read my lips, no new taxes.
407000	416000	And they're like a big lip and there's like a tax coming out and they're like, yep. I don't like, I just, just be a werewolf or something, man.
417000	428000	The only funny one I ever saw, I think I probably mentioned this when we talked about this a long time ago, was my friend Melissa dressed up as Barbie and she had a big shrimp on her head. And she was shrimp on the Barbie. It was pretty good.
428000	435000	I don't, I will, I don't, I don't, I don't approve. That's exactly what I'm talking about. I don't, I don't, I don't...
435000	440000	But that one, you saw it and you instantly knew what it was. Like, you didn't have to puzzle over it.
440000	449000	Okay, maybe, maybe, okay. Maybe, I guess. I just don't want, I don't want your, I don't want your costume to be a riddle. I don't want it to have a question and an answer.
449000	457000	It's like, you know, if you're going to do that, go is what you are, a vampire. But Dan, Dan, you're just going as a different kind of vampire.
458000	470000	Everybody, this is coming from a gentleman who once found an old computer monitor on the side of the road, put it on his head, dressed up in fur and called him and put horns on the side of the computer monitor and called himself monitor.
470000	475000	Yeah. Because it was joyful and it was like, it was a...
476000	477000	What's the difference?
477000	484000	No, because that's like a He-Man figure. That's like, like, look, I'm monitor. Do that. Yeah. Be like, be like, yeah.
484000	486000	How is that different than shrimp on the barbie?
487000	493000	Because it couldn't beat He-Man? Like, I'm saying like...
493000	495000	That's sexist. You're being sexist now.
495000	498000	No, make a thing that has a name, like...
498000	505000	But you were doing the minotaur, but you're a monitor. I'm saying it's a fine line. You're walking there.
506000	518000	It's a fine, but solid line. It's not blurry. It's like, yeah, I guess it's razor thin, but it's a line that still separates, like, joy from joylessness.
518000	522000	Didn't you win a contest at Molly Malone's?
522000	532000	Yes, because they felt my relaxation and joy. Like, it was a big fat dude in a fur diaper with a computer monitor in his head, a monitor and I won because I was living the dream.
532000	537000	I was cheating the system and they loved it and, yeah.
537000	547000	Like, I do Halloween right. I start with comfort. I back into an explanation. I go to the 99 cent store. I see some stuff. I tape it to my body.
547000	555000	Do you remember the time that I didn't win the pumpkin carving contest because there was a conspiracy against how good my pumpkin was?
555000	558000	Yeah, I guess.
559000	568000	Carved a dragon into a pumpkin. People got all bummed out about it. Like, yeah, you're not supposed to be good at it. It's supposed to be scary faces.
568000	570000	Yeah.
570000	573000	We knew who won.
573000	583000	All right. So I was in Santa Monica for a wedding this weekend and this is the craziest thing. Well, this is a first for me.
583000	593000	I ran into my wedding planner on the beach. Like, I was just walking and I'm there for another wedding and then I ran into, I didn't know who she was at first.
593000	603000	She was like, Dan Harmon as I live and breathe. And I'm like, I don't know who that is. It's like, but she's standing on Santa Monica beach with a clipboard and a pen.
604000	616000	However I know her, something's happened since then that I don't want to ask questions about, like getting signatures for a new shampoo or something.
616000	629000	I don't think I ever knew anybody. I stepped a couple steps and then it was like, wait, shit, she said she's out here working. Who works on a clipboard or the pen on the beach?
629000	640000	And then it was like, wait, wait, wait. Oh my God, it's Christine. It's my wedding planner. And then I was like, filled with this shame because I was like, oh, I'm sorry. It didn't, it didn't work out.
640000	644000	And she's like, I don't care. Get married again.
644000	646000	She gets paid by the hour.
646000	648000	By the wedding at least. Yeah.
648000	650000	She's got no back end on that.
650000	657000	But I was like, filled with this grief, like, like your wedding planner is really invested in the institution of marriage.
657000	660000	I put, I put, I put the fuck out of that thing.
660000	666000	It was a good wedding. Everybody agrees it was a great wedding. The marriage is up to me. It's not her problem.
666000	670000	And then she was, she had been recently divorced too. Like she would, she had been recently married.
670000	679000	I mean, like that was also, that made it nice and relieving. She's like, divorce is better. Yeah, it is. It is. It's better than marriage.
679000	685000	I mean, that's a good, it's easier. It's a good business model for a wedding planner. You want everyone, you want those, you want that, you want turnover.
685000	691000	Yeah. She may, she may do that on purpose. Maybe when she's, when she's talking to clients, she's like, I just got married and it's great.
691000	697000	Like, and then when she runs into her former clients, she's like, I just got divorced. You should get married again.
697000	700000	I'm going to.
700000	711000	There, there's some vice thing. The special that I haven't watched yet, but the director of Great Minds was telling me about it.
711000	723000	They, they used HIV to kill cancer. They like, you can modify HIV's protein structures so that it's a little noodle that it uses to plug into white blood cells, only plugs into cancer cells.
723000	733000	And so they tried it on 20 kids with leukemia and 18 of them are alive and cancer free. I think I'm going to get some of this wrong. You're going to watch it or look it up and like, like, go ahead and correct me.
733000	737000	You can give cancer AIDS.
737000	746000	Can you imagine living in our lifetime where we not only cure cancer, but, but, but we use AIDS.
746000	754000	And it's not after you, after, after, after you laugh at that, because it's like, oh yeah, it's like when the Raptors fought the, the, the, the super saurus or whatever.
754000	763000	It's, it's, it's like, it's like, uh, I could've just said Raptors tackle the T-Rex of the Jurassic Park, but I don't know if these kids have seen Jurassic Park one.
763000	781000	A lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of kids online decrying Westworld further. They're like, this Creighton guy, you know, this, so you know, you're talking to a millennial TV viewer when they're like exposing Michael Creighton's formulaic use of the, oh, that old dinosaur park idea recycled for your new cowboy show, eh?
781000	784000	Fool me once, Mr. Creighton.
784000	787000	Oh, you fucking star baby.
787000	795000	You fucking 25 year old immortal little AI puke.
795000	805000	Good. I've been out of town. I haven't seen it. I loved it. I can't wait. That's going to be on again tonight. And yeah, we'll see how the series plays out, but the pilot delivered everything that I said I wanted.
805000	822000	Cause I was like, this should be a show about like creepy scientists living underneath a fake deadwood and because they deal with people that are just like so much more than sex dolls, so much more than a target practice.
822000	845000	Like they're creating life down there, but they're also creating it for the exact purpose of like using it hedonistically. So I want to see like weird poly sexual, like confused psychological people in lab coats having weird relationships with these nano, nano slabs that they then push up into this town and forced to live on narrative loops.
845000	857000	Uh, with it inspired by like, uh, you know, what we've learned about that science from like video games and stuff and the new depiction of Westworld instead of it just being like James Brolin being like, come on, you can shoot them.
857000	866000	Just go shoot them. It's like, it's so much more realistic. The depiction of what it's like to like show up to Westworld because of, we've played all these video games now where you've, we've had to create those environments.
866000	875000	So that's like, you walk down the street and there's just like a guy going like, who will step up and fight this varmint? You know, it's like, like, like, they're like talking and kind of, they have narrative loops.
875000	887000	Is there a Yule Brent or bad guy in this one? Is there? Yes, but well, I don't want to, uh, yes, yes, but he's human. So, and that just represents like everything's kind of inverted.
887000	893000	Okay. So it's like, like, like, it's, it's a representation. Who's playing Richard Benjamin's eyebrows in this.
893000	911000	All right. So you should just, just watch it. The pilot is definitely worth watching. It's a mind blower. Um, and I hope that I hope the series like, uh, is, can be, can fill our, uh, can fill our game of thrones, uh, hole. Um, uh, whatever. Okay. So I read whatever. Okay. Well, I,
912000	937000	Tonight I'm going to fill your game of thrones hole. That's my promise. Uh, let's, let's bring out our guests. Uh, I won't make the verbal segue from, from that to that, but, uh, she is, uh, certainly I've, I've called her the Michael Jordan of porn, like, uh, which is, which is no, it's like, like, she's, she's been at 437 films, uh, so far.
938000	951000	Remember the, the, the current, uh, the, the modern porn world, like it's, it's like beyond music in terms of like how hard it would be to be distinct, uh, and, and rack up, uh, like, like, you know, for people to know your name.
951000	956000	But I think a lot of people have heard the name Riley Reed, haven't you? All right.
957000	960000	Uh, three dudes audibly came just now.
962000	974000	Uh, in 2013, LA weekly ranked her eighth on their list of 10 porn stars who could be their next Jenna Jamison, which means nothing now because Jenna Jamison wasn't living in this crazy world where porn is like a growing on trees and free to everybody.
975000	976000	That was back when Jurassic park was in.
977000	988000	Um, I mean, uh, so she's, she's, she, her, her awards, her, her accolades of things. I mean, if there's anybody that represents like the, she's the, she's the most legit porn star.
989000	999000	I think we could, uh, you know, have to talk to about this stuff. And she's a, she's a wonderful gal and, uh, made friends with her recently because Justin noticed from her Instagram that she was a big Rick and Morty fan.
1000000	1015000	She was like, she, she was singing a song from Rick and Morty. Uh, I think we'll pushing her butt up in the air. I can't remember. I was like, because I had, had, had been over raised the posterior to the song that the president does with Rick and Morty and that she was saying anyways.
1016000	1025000	So he reached out to her and said, Hey, I want to be friends. And she, she's been to the, she's, she, we were, we talked to her more on the, Dan, relax, take it.
1026000	1033000	I'm excited. I'm excited. Take a deep breath. You weren't this nervous and Robin Williams is on the show.
1035000	1036000	Please welcome Riley Reed.
1036000	1060000	Can I get you a drink? Would you like a, another vodka on the rocks? Uh, I'm still drinking my current one, but thank you.
1060000	1082000	Yup. My gracious host. So Riley, Riley, is that true? You, you were, you singing a Rick and Morty song during one of your films? It wasn't during one of my films. It was just like a recording on my Instagram video where I was like, head, bend over, raise the posterior, you know, so yeah, I'm like, definitely probably the number one Rick and Morty fan. So nice.
1083000	1102000	Uh, all right. So I've got like my limited, you know, limited edition jockery. Oh shit. You got one of those. Okay. Yeah. I got number two. Well, you should have it. Nah, he does the voices and I wouldn't have texted you or whatever. However he did to reach out to you. I actually reached out to him. Oh really? Yeah.
1102000	1113000	I was like asking questions about Rick and Morty. Oh, awesome. So when I'm looking at my phone, by the way, I'm not being aloof. I'm like, I have like notes from down there. I think we should get, we should get one of the first things out of the way.
1114000	1122000	Actually. Well, let's save it. Let's put a pin in the prop 60 thing. Cause this stuff you were telling me backstage is like, it's really important. You're seeing these ads already tonight during the debates about this prop 60 thing.
1122000	1135000	You like, like I'm, it's a fucking house of mirrors. I didn't even, the, the, the, the, that we, you want to hear what she has to say. So when you're voting, then this thing has dropped on you as a California voter that you're informed.
1135000	1146000	Um, uh, but, but okay, here's like a question you're probably sick of ask answering, but, but I, it's like, ha you have a relationship. You have a boyfriend. How long have you been with your boyfriend? We've been together over a year.
1146000	1158000	Um, how, but even aside from that, that's not even related, but like, how is porn sex different from the sex you have off camera? Is there, is there?
1158000	1173000	Well, it's totally different one because there's more people in the room than one on one sex. But I mean, it's also the intimate connection, you know, because we're so in love and whatnot. So that's like a totally different realm.
1173000	1184000	Then when I'm like having sex with somebody on camera, it's like more of a grotesque, like, I'm just going to fuck you and then work with you again, maybe a couple of weeks later or something.
1184000	1199000	Well, in terms of, yeah, if you're an objective viewer, which it's a, if you were a person, uh, floating in the corner of the room that was invisible and it was watching you have intimate love based sex.
1200000	1204000	What, what mechanical things are different? You're doing things for the cameras, I assume.
1204000	1215000	I mean, you're definitely doing things for the camera. I have to be not, I mean, for some pornos, they are like, you know, romance scene where they don't even want us to acknowledge the existence of a camera and they don't care about opening up.
1215000	1231000	But usually I have to like hold my ass cheek to make sure you can see the penetration and, you know, you're not, it's not as, you know, usually when I'm like fucking, I like to ride my boyfriend's dick and like have my clit rubbing against him as well as the penetration.
1231000	1233000	And in regular.
1233000	1236000	Riley, I expected more candor out of you.
1236000	1238000	Don't let this face deceive you.
1238000	1240000	Stop deflecting from the question.
1242000	1244000	We're trying to get to the truth here.
1244000	1248000	I'm just saying it's, it's, you have a favorite position.
1248000	1263000	It's just being having to open up for the camera. Like no matter what position from doggy or this or that, even like you just have to like, I have to hold my ass cheek open, you know, imagine in porn, like in a scene you're required to hit like in an average porn scene.
1263000	1270000	You have to hit like all these like comma sutra, like I mean, we have four positions, minimum kind of a thing.
1270000	1274000	You always have to have four positions. It's like there's always blowjob in between.
1274000	1278000	So like, that's like, you know, the usual mandatory kind of a thing.
1278000	1285000	And then there's the, you know, the scenario that goes along with the porno that usually they want you to keep alive throughout your sex scene.
1285000	1291000	So they want you to, otherwise it becomes very illegal if you don't keep alive, I think.
1291000	1297000	No, no, no. I mean, like, you know, if I'm the pizza delivery girl, they want me to talk about, you know, my boss might call me.
1297000	1302000	I should go back to work, you know, like they want us to keep that essence alive.
1302000	1308000	It's not, I'm not really, you know, I mean, sometimes we'll foreplay at home, but it's not the whole stereotype.
1308000	1317000	I mean, we definitely lost the narrative when we lost film, like you've seen Boogie Nights, I assume, like, and they go, that's that transition from film to video where,
1317000	1327000	where that foreshadows the transition from to the internet world where porn is just now, it's like, is Gonzo the right word?
1327000	1333000	It's just like, it's not narrative at all. Does Gonzo mean, like, brutally disgusting?
1333000	1336000	No, no, Gonzo means like, it's just like, hey, we're fucking.
1336000	1340000	Right. It's like, hey, what's your name? Samantha, how old are you? Okay, here's a dick.
1340000	1342000	And like, that's Gonzo.
1342000	1344000	Yeah, you're 18, right?
1345000	1354000	So the, the, just to go back to that, that one loop, though, because I'm just curious,
1354000	1364000	the, you're hitting those four bases, for instance, when you're doing a scene for work, when you're being intimate with someone that you love,
1364000	1372000	are you, you said you mentioned you have this, this favorite position, might that mean that it's like, you don't, you don't, you guys don't hit all, there's not like a bunch of,
1372000	1377000	no, it's like, you might just do a very boring, like, like, let's just do this because this is what I like.
1377000	1385000	Sometimes we like wake up in the morning, we just have like regular morning sex. Other times, you know, we're like in the kitchen and we're fucking everywhere in the kitchen, you know?
1385000	1387000	So it's like, it's definitely in the heat.
1387000	1390000	But a plumber never comes in and goes, what's going on here?
1391000	1392000	Not anymore.
1393000	1395000	We change neighborhoods at sinks.
1396000	1399000	What is the difference Riley, between a good porn director and a bad one?
1400000	1404000	I hate when the porn directors try to micromanage the sex.
1404000	1412000	So there are, sometimes I'm on a sex scene and they're like, okay, now like run your hand down his chest and then put your fingers in his pants.
1412000	1414000	That's like a line reading for a regular actor.
1414000	1415000	Don't tell me how to talk.
1415000	1422000	Yeah, no, there's literally times where I've been on set and it's really sad that there is literally a woman sitting there telling me what to do.
1422000	1424000	I'm like, how do they even edit your voice out?
1424000	1430000	Like I don't understand, like literally the whole time she was like, okay, now brush her hair behind her ear.
1431000	1439000	Like it's, I mean, yes, it's sweet, but at the same time, it's just like, I don't understand why her presence is here.
1440000	1441000	Wait, who was she? Was she a director?
1441000	1442000	She was a director.
1443000	1447000	This was actually for Penthouse and I was like so disappointed.
1447000	1448000	I was like, micromanage sex.
1448000	1450000	Like, you're going to tell me how to squeeze in his balls.
1451000	1452000	You can't just go and do it.
1452000	1455000	Yeah. Okay. Yeah, girl, that's good to know.
1456000	1457000	No, that's interesting.
1459000	1478000	In terms of just the, we were talking, and I think we can segue then into the Prop 60 thing because like, well, first of all, like, is there, do you perceive a wall between yourself because you work in porn and like civilians, like anybody outside that industry?
1478000	1483000	Like, do you think that you're like, do you feel alienated, isolated?
1483000	1490000	Do you, do you, like, if you would, if you go to a party and someone says, what do you do?
1490000	1492000	Is there like, I mean, do you, do you?
1492000	1495000	No, I'm like, I'm personally very comfortable with what I do.
1495000	1499000	Like I'll sit next to a plane, I'll sit on a plane next to somebody.
1499000	1501000	If they ask me what I do, I'm just blunt.
1501000	1504000	And I tell them, like, I'm a porn star, adult actress.
1504000	1512000	And usually they're like, oh, like, and then sometimes when I say adult actress, they're like, like, were you a child star kind of thing?
1512000	1515000	Like, people are very confused sometimes.
1515000	1521000	And I've also happened, that happened where a lady was like writing a book on sex, sex workers.
1521000	1531000	So she was like, oh my God, like, you're, can I ask you a million questions, you know, like, but I'm very comfortable personally, so I don't usually have any like weird issues with that.
1531000	1533000	But I do get recognized a lot.
1533000	1535000	I do have a lot of people like, no.
1535000	1537000	You're extremely recognizable.
1537000	1541000	And that's the other part of the question is like, how safe do you feel?
1541000	1546000	Because I, podcasting, like, you're, it's not really safe.
1546000	1554000	Sometimes I feel like it's not fair because they have an, like, they have an advantage where I can't give the first impression of myself.
1554000	1557000	They already have the impression of who I am.
1557000	1567000	So it's like an unfair advantage because, like, I have no idea who you are, but you guys have seen my asshole, you know, like, so it's, you know, it's kind of like, not fair.
1567000	1569000	But it's also very interesting.
1569000	1571000	Tonight, Riley, we have a special gift for you.
1571000	1574000	We're going to make everybody here show you their assets.
1574000	1577000	Yes, please.
1577000	1579000	I hope you too, man.
1579000	1583000	We have to have a custodian of records go through first and collect very certificates.
1583000	1588000	I should tell you, I should tell you something about those chocolates I handed out before the show.
1588000	1592000	They're filled with tape head cleaner.
1592000	1594000	Do you know about that thing or are you too young?
1594000	1595000	Aimal nitrate.
1595000	1598000	Aimal head cleaner is like an anal dilator.
1598000	1599000	Aimal nitrate.
1599000	1601000	Like, it dilates your sphincter.
1601000	1603000	Oh, I've heard of poppers.
1603000	1604000	VHS tape head cleaner.
1604000	1608000	If you huff it, it makes your butthole get nice and ready for poppers.
1608000	1610000	It, like, relaxes you or something.
1610000	1613000	It also gets you high, but also it relaxes your butthole.
1613000	1614000	Yes, yes.
1614000	1616000	I've definitely heard of those.
1616000	1621000	Well, I would think, though, stalking is what I'm talking about.
1621000	1627000	Like, we have a twisted relationship with sex in the sex industry in this country.
1627000	1629000	We have a twisted relationship with fame.
1629000	1632000	We have a twisted relationship with media, fantasy.
1632000	1639000	Like, we don't have our, you know, I'm not saying there's some other country where they've achieved it,
1639000	1648000	but I'm just saying, like, we, there, I would, if you told me that you get frightened for your life seven times a day,
1648000	1649000	I wouldn't be shocked.
1649000	1654000	But I don't, like, fans think they know you, fans, like...
1654000	1655000	I mean, definitely.
1655000	1658000	Like, some fans really think they know me.
1658000	1660000	I've had, like, I've never had, like, a stalker.
1660000	1662000	I've never had to, like, put a restraining order on somebody.
1662000	1663000	Really?
1663000	1664000	Yeah, luckily.
1664000	1666000	Have you ever met Donald Trump?
1667000	1669000	Thank God, no, and I don't plan on it.
1669000	1677000	I mean, yeah, you might get the actual amount of negative or unwanted attention that anybody would get, like, being a good-looking woman.
1677000	1679000	Like, you might just get that anyway, right?
1679000	1680000	Well, then you compound that with arts.
1680000	1681000	But I mean, I get a lot of emails.
1681000	1687000	Like, I'll get some crazy emails from, like, some fans who, like, they'll start off the email talking about how much they love me,
1687000	1693000	and then it's like, and I hate you so much, and then I also love you, and I hope I never talk to you again,
1693000	1695000	and then they'll email me two days later.
1696000	1697000	Right.
1697000	1698000	Like...
1698000	1700000	Again, Riley, I told you, I was sorry about that.
1700000	1701000	Sometimes I get drunk.
1701000	1706000	There's probably a lot of confusion there, because there's no culture, there's no custom to set the boundaries.
1706000	1707000	Yeah, they don't know.
1707000	1708000	There's no...
1708000	1713000	Yeah, they have an intimate knowledge of you that you don't have of them,
1713000	1721000	and people, I mean, people feel a weird emotional connection with actors that don't show everything and do everything.
1721000	1723000	So, yeah, you're getting a whole different thing.
1723000	1724000	That's the thing.
1724000	1727000	You listen to somebody for two hours a week every week for a couple years.
1727000	1729000	It's like, I don't think it's...
1729000	1731000	I'm not shocked at all when I run into people.
1731000	1736000	I'm very lucky with the people that, like, listen, but it's definite,
1736000	1739000	and I have that relationship with people that I listen to on podcasts.
1739000	1743000	I go, I run into somebody that I listen to a lot, and I'm like, I know this person.
1743000	1744000	I own this person a little bit.
1744000	1746000	There's, like, I know who they are.
1746000	1748000	Like you said, there's an advantage there.
1748000	1751000	So, I just, like, but I guess that's the end of the conversation,
1751000	1753000	because it's very uplifting news that you're, like,
1753000	1756000	no, no, you haven't, you've never filed a single restraining order.
1756000	1757000	Like, it kind of says it all.
1757000	1759000	Like, it's not as bad as I would think it would be.
1759000	1760000	Yeah, usually my fans are really neighborly.
1760000	1765000	Like, if I see them, they're just like, yo, Riley Rude, you know, like, they're super chill.
1765000	1768000	There also might be another, I mean, I'm guessing this, but I'm probably wrong,
1768000	1772000	but, like, people have seen and know so much about you physically and, like,
1772000	1779000	and intimately that there's really, like, what, like, they've already got the answer to all those questions.
1779000	1782000	Yeah, I mean, that's something to be said for, I mean,
1782000	1784000	do you have an opinion about that in general?
1784000	1789000	Like, like, you were, well, you were a psychology major in college, weren't you?
1789000	1790000	Very briefly, but yes.
1790000	1793000	I dropped out before the end of my freshman year.
1793000	1797000	I was going to be a psych minor, but that means nothing when you're a freshman.
1797000	1798000	Yeah, I did.
1798000	1801000	But, but, but, you have an interest in this shit ostensibly.
1801000	1809000	Like, what do you, do you have an opinion about, like, our relationship on a national level with pornography?
1810000	1812000	Like, what is going on there?
1812000	1817000	I mean, I think that just goes on, like, a person, like, a personal intelligence level, you know,
1817000	1822000	with somebody who's able to distinguish the difference that this is fantasy and this is this person's job.
1822000	1826000	And, you know, when people choose to believe that the bang bus is real,
1826000	1831000	like, they're allowing themselves to be manipulated by society.
1831000	1833000	Wait, I'm going to stop you right there.
1833000	1840000	I have to believe in something.
1840000	1844000	The fucking bang bus.
1844000	1851000	But collectively, do you perceive our, our country, again, you can stop me and go, this isn't my jurisdiction.
1851000	1857000	But, but we've got, we've got, there's debates going on right now where there's a guy who's, you know, rampant,
1857000	1864000	like, verbal misogynist of nothing else who, like, hearsates, and he's running against the, who will be the first female president.
1864000	1872000	So there's issues coming up, like, as a woman and as a pornographic actor, like, what is your, like,
1872000	1875000	how do you see this country's relationship, like, in general?
1875000	1883000	Not in, you meet all these different people, but, like, are we, when you take us all collectively, are we sick?
1883000	1888000	Are we healthy? Are we, like, is there anything that could be said that needs to change in general?
1888000	1891000	Or is it just fucking complicated?
1891000	1897000	Well, I mean, I know one thing is that we currently, like, the most popular taboo is no longer incest,
1897000	1901000	which was definitely a thing for a while where, you know, the most popular porn.
1901000	1908000	I took a break from, my search engine probably contributed to that a lot.
1908000	1911000	What is now the number one taboo?
1911000	1919000	I don't know what it was. I don't know what it is. I think it might be tranny porn, but it was for a very long time incest porn.
1919000	1920000	Huh.
1920000	1922000	So that's, that says a lot for you.
1922000	1927000	Like, Pornhub, you, Pornhub has, like, been mainstreamifying porn a little bit.
1927000	1934000	Like, they, somewhat consciously, somewhat just indirect result of it being a porn hub.
1934000	1940000	But they issue, like, these press releases and go, like, like, they'll do little funny things on April Fool's Day.
1940000	1945000	They'll, they'll issue, they'll go, like, oh, it's St. Patrick's Day. Here's how many people searched for leprechaun porn.
1945000	1952000	Which I always thought, I thought it was a very positive thing because it's, like, they're acknowledging just as, like, the what's his face, Kinsey did.
1952000	1962000	Like, that was the part of that story was, like, it was about revealing to everybody that their relationship with sex was, was simultaneously private
1962000	1966000	and therefore a beautiful snowflake, but also shared by everybody.
1966000	1976000	Everybody, everybody's a freak. Everybody, everybody's, everybody's coming and, and, and, and going and, like, like, and it's, and it's okay.
1976000	1980000	It's like, like, it's like, I don't think there's anything wrong with porn. I don't think it's wrong.
1980000	1981000	Well, I wouldn't expect you to say that.
1981000	1983000	No, yeah, I mean, well.
1983000	1985000	But, but I mean, like, like, our attitude towards it.
1985000	2001000	I think I, like, I feel like we're really fucked up about it and that one of the things that we do and get away with because we're fucked up about it is we, we treat your industry as if it's like, I don't know, it's like,
2001000	2003000	I was definitely shunned upon.
2003000	2019000	And therefore it's like the danger of that is like, well, if we value people and if the, like, of our, if our taboos about porn have to do with, like, caring about people, then, like, it's like we built this wall around this thing that we go like, oh, that's a toilet, you know, because that's where I go every night.
2019000	2025000	Yeah, I'm totally, to a lot of people, like, I have, like, no meaning of life to them.
2025000	2038000	Like, they're like, oh, you're a porn star? Like, exactly, like, I'm a toilet to them, you know, like, like, they say that I lose all, I can't think of the right word I want to say, but like, you know, I'm just like, no longer equal, you know, they're like, you have no rights, you know, like.
2038000	2049000	I hope this doesn't offend you, but I, I, I heard a story, I was talking about you with Justin during Comic Con, we were just seeing you on the yacht, the Game of Thrones, people invaded and they didn't invade, we wanted them there.
2049000	2078000	They just seem like they're always invading, they're so, they're so medieval. But, but I was just mentioning, oh, she seems so nice. And I asked her if she'd be on the podcast. And he, I heard a story, like, third hand through him about you being at a party and like somebody just kind of like, just as a casual matter of fact, like just somebody, not from the industry, somebody that didn't know you, but somebody that was at a party with you, just kind of like, like saying things and treating you in ways that sort of imply that you were down for whatever reason.
2079000	2088000	Whatever, because of what you did for a living. Oh yeah, I definitely have a lot of people who will automatically assume that like, I'm the world's biggest slut and I'm just gonna suck their dick right there, you know.
2088000	2101000	Because if you do it when you're working, then I mean, like I do it for a hobby, let's, let's. It's a great role. Dan, that was very brave of you to admit that. That I do it for a hobby. Yeah.
2101000	2108000	That's what I, I mean, I wanted to, yeah, just like, I mean, I just like, I think our attitude just in general, like, and I'm sure this is gonna change over time.
2108000	2119000	Yeah, I mean, people, I think, just automatically assume that I'm like this crazy sex freak, you know, it's just like, even though they might be way hornier and freakier than I am, they just automatically assume because I do it on camera.
2119000	2131000	And, you know, maybe just I have more confidence with it. They automatically assume that I am like a freaky person. Like, I have people like randomly tell me, I like tell them I'm a porn star and they're like, oh, I was like raped once. Right.
2131000	2144000	And I'm like, I don't know how this is associating. I don't know how to respond to you. Like, I'm just a sex worker, but. I have a question, Riley. You hear stories like, I mean, I, I'm a crap actor and I do failed TV shows for a living.
2144000	2155000	But there, but there's times like it could be something big on camera, like a big network thing or a small thing that we do for channel one on one, like our little friends make videos, our little friends, our actual awesome friends.
2155000	2165000	And you'll come home after like shooting something that was either well paid or not paid. And you feel this great sense of like, oh, wow, that was really good. Like, I did good work today.
2166000	2178000	Yeah, definitely. There are days where, you know, also it's because it goes all hand in hand. If I feel like my fellow peers were like killing it, then there's definitely days where I'm like, fuck, like that scene is probably going to win an award because we like killed it.
2178000	2194000	You can go home after after having filmed sex and go like, yeah, like we we did it. We did. Yeah, definitely. I mean, there's definitely times where you can like feel like there was like a genuine sexual passion that was going on that you're like, that was hot.
2194000	2202000	Is that something you're striving for while you're doing it? Think like, I want people to really watch this and I want this to be like endure. I want I want this to be a clip that people will.
2202000	2218000	Well, most times I just try to like enjoy it for what it is. Like, I mean, if I'm not really feeling the person, it's going to probably show on camera and I'm not going to try to like false advertise it like, you know, like there's times where I'm not totally into my partner or, you know, like maybe they.
2218000	2224000	See, I can't imagine I'm so easily distracted that there was eight people around with microphones and camera equipment and some.
2224000	2234000	So that's also a really erotic part of it, too, that there's, you know, a guy holding a boom stick the whole time. And I'm like, you're just watching me slob on this now.
2234000	2242000	So like there's other parts to it. If maybe I'm not totally into like the person I'm fucking, I'm like, oh, yeah, well, they're enjoying the show.
2242000	2250000	Are there people that must be because you've been like you've been enough films now where you see an actor like another guy like, oh, geez, not this fucking guy.
2250000	2258000	I have a no list. So really, oh, yeah, you get kill rights. Now you can say fuck that guy. I know there's like one guy I won't work with just because he makes the sound.
2258000	2269000	He goes. So I'm like, this is the kind of shit I want to know about. That's one guy I'm just like, I'm like looking at the director like, really?
2269000	2280000	Like, I can't even take this guy. There's a there's a there's a I end up with a lot of Russian stuff because I think it's like a foot fetish nylon thing.
2280000	2285000	That's like that's the one of the categories that I'm into, like, like, like legs and hosiery and stuff.
2285000	2295000	And so I end up like I've seen this. There's this Russian guy and his version of going, oh, is you.
2295000	2312000	And I can't like I just like pants around my ankles, just ready to go Saturday night. I got my Emmy in one hand, I got I got everything I need to see your left hander.
2312000	2320000	And then this is like, ew, ew, ew. It's like, well, it's also it's like they may have like a foot in his face. Are you saying that?
2320000	2327000	I'm like, well, you're that's what you're supposed to say when someone puts a foot in your face. That's not what you're supposed to say.
2327000	2339000	Anyways, but you you you you you you glossed over something that I think is kind of like I this is just a like this is the big bug zapper in the room.
2339000	2355000	Like, like when you when people find out you're you're in this field, like the association of that real or imagined with trauma, like, like, like, like, OK, so like that is something that people leap to something bad happened to you.
2355000	2363000	Like, like, oh, yeah, people ask my dad when my dad's like, yeah, my daughter's a porn star when it comes up, they are automatically like, did you do something to her?
2363000	2373000	Like, and it's sad. It's really sad that my own dad kind of deals with it as well as I do because nothing ever I've always just been this crazy sexual fiend my whole entire life.
2373000	2380000	So like when I was like asked to be an extra on a porno, I was like, yeah, that's awesome. And then like I saw them doing it. I was like, I want to do that.
2380000	2387000	I can I can I was already like having guys run trains on me. I was having sex with girls, threesomes orgies, like all in high school.
2387000	2400000	Like, it was just totally fun and what I was doing. So the industry is a place where where that is lucrative, where that is like your your status is rising when that happens instead of we're all tested in high school.
2400000	2409000	You're you're like you're being like maligned by the people that are. Well, I mean, I was I was definitely manipulating situation.
2409000	2424000	You were you were you were the scar face of your high school because you had the you had the goods. But speaking of which, like, you're like, you're like, but would you say I mean, so so would you when you look at your childhood because it's a Wikipedia says you're moved around a lot.
2424000	2432000	You're you're from Florida. Those are two warning signs. That's her friend. Sorry, Florida.
2432000	2446000	But I mean, just like, like, like, like relative to everybody in this room, would you say squeaky clean kind of like trauma free childhood? Is that what you're saying? Or is it like, I mean, it was like, I didn't really have trauma necessarily.
2446000	2455000	I mean, like, I lived a normal, you know, like middle class, if not like slightly lower kind of life, like, I mean, my parents were divorced and both remarried.
2455000	2466000	But like, no, like real trauma, like, you know, everything was totally chill in my family. Like, I don't I think I was pretty normal. My mom was super open. I would tell her when I was going to do like acid and shrooms.
2466000	2477000	Like, all right, mom, just so you know, like, what is the like, I've met a couple of people just like, you know, over time, like just living in town here, like people that have worked like as producers.
2477000	2488000	And the two people that I know that were in it were like, they were really sleazy. Like, what's the industry like, like, like in terms of the people that create it, direct it, run the websites?
2488000	2494000	Is it is it a fun industry to be in? Or is it is there a lot of creeps? Or what is it?
2494000	2505000	I personally would consider it more fun. But I mean, there's definitely like the sleazy kind of creepy people. But I've like kind of worked my way past and through all that.
2505000	2508000	Now you get to pick and choose your status now.
2508000	2520000	Yeah. And also like what the agency that I work with and everything like they he only goes through like I started off with a different agency who like sent me once to Seattle, which I was like, this guy is just has a camcorder.
2520000	2531000	Like, this is definitely not a porno. Yeah. So let's talk about that for a second. Like how it's structured because most of us are just like, it's anybody's guess you have an agent. He has he worked for an agency.
2532000	2544000	He runs his agency is like Mark Spiegeler. And so he gets the all the gigs come through him, he calls you and says, like, okay, double anal on the 13th or whatever.
2544000	2553000	Double anal is there such a thing as double anal? It's actually bad luck to do it on the 13th.
2554000	2562000	And then you have stuff that you do do don't do then there's the girl guy and it's like whatever I knew. And then there's a price and it's it's still the case as it was in the 90s.
2562000	2582000	I mean, it was always like, like the women run the industry like or that was the that was maybe our overcompensatory like like sort of like like statement because the women get paid more and the women do have like kill rights on scenes like like the guy if a woman says I don't work with that guy that guy is like like like a significant part of his career is kind of fucked, like, especially if the woman is you.
2582000	2594000	And so like, like, like, even though, like, but I think back then, even though that was being said about the women that were in these scenes, the hierarchy was still probably male dominated.
2594000	2604000	But now is that different? Because you're your own boss, basically, like you have your own website, Europe, you produce, you told me you edit your own stuff. And when I marveled at that, you're like, well, it's porn editing.
2605000	2621000	Like, I could be a pretty bad editor and still be a great porn editor. But but but it's still like pretty cool to imagine you with headphones and because I'm assuming you have neighbors and then you're like, like, you're like, you're like, you're like, got the fight. Do you use Final Cut or avid?
2622000	2631000	I use Adobe Adobe, like premier. You ever take it over into After Effects, just throw some lasers in there.
2636000	2647000	Not yet. Not yet. I just do this pretty fun, like Halloween thing, but no, nothing to that extent. But you're producing your own stuff. So you're in your website, read my lips.com. Yeah, very clever.
2648000	2661000	That's like you're like, I bet I bet most people who have seen your your face and heard your name, it's probably like porn hub is becoming like this thing that's gotta be like an ally and an enemy to you, right?
2661000	2672000	For sure. I mean, I definitely I definitely am very fond of them because I do think that they help my career a lot. Like, especially I've I've not for the last couple years, I haven't been less than rated number four.
2672000	2687000	And the last couple months, I've always been the rated number one porn star on Pornhub. So that automatically just comes up a lot. And currently, I have like this program with them where if I upload my videos and I get some money based on like ad views or whatever.
2687000	2696000	So I have like, but I don't put any of like my super sex stuff that's like on my website, it'll be like me washing the dishes naked or something. And that has like almost a million views.
2697000	2708000	Well, because I and I've always said this about like the the no one knows how to monetize the internet, except the porn industry has always been able to because the porn industry kind of runs on I mean, word advancements of everything.
2708000	2722000	Right. That's true. Technology to write VR and everything like the sex dolls. I just did. I just did, did VR and had had boobs like like, like porn will one day free us from everything like
2723000	2730000	it will advance us in ways we didn't know I was like, that's a nice boobs like, and they're mine.
2730000	2747000	I mean, I just had this one sex toy that was molded after me that will now be able to like it'll have memory of like what makes you ejaculate and it's supposed to be called the perfect fuck and it'll know it'll also be self lubricating.
2747000	2758000	It'll like it sounds like over the cold open of a dystopian. This is like the at 209. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to get married.
2759000	2763000	They tried to make one sex toy based on me but the shipping costs were too big.
2763000	2773000	Thank you. Eat those chocolates, everybody.
2775000	2790000	So, yeah, so, so Pornhub is mainstreamifying in the, you know, it's making it's making making us maybe hopefully relax about porn a little bit. It's also helping self starters. It's like, but it might also be it. You have to like,
2790000	2800000	yeah, I mean, I have to contact them constantly to remove scenes that are up on my website. One thing I do super exclusively is anal like I only shoot that for myself and one other company.
2800000	2810000	So they'll take my own anal scenes from my own website. So I have to like email them and be like, hey, take down my pizza delivery girl anal scene like that's special.
2811000	2823000	That's my only gang bang that exists online and it's like exclusively at my website. Do you try I saw the thumbnail for that one. So, which means I was like, I was like, it was like, it shouldn't have been there.
2823000	2833000	The do you this I felt like I, I wanted to say this, but it was like, I don't know if you hear this all the time and if this makes you happy or sad or what your reaction to this is, but fuck it.
2833000	2849000	I'll just like, like, like my girlfriend and I watch porn together. We've seen you a thousand times in different things and then we met you and now we it's like both of us individually and as a couple like we don't like we don't click you anymore.
2849000	2864000	What is that? That's because we're bad people, right? Because I think it's also I think it's also just American society the way it kind of like has portrayed us to be in like the way that the standards are like, you don't fuck your friends.
2864000	2875000	Right. You know, that's like, and it's also just like, like, oh, there's a threshold you have to go through everything has to be about like, I'm not a fantasy. Now I'm like this tangible thing in order for my girlfriend and I to enjoy watching porn together.
2875000	2891000	We have to we have to have this unspoken agreement that we're doing something base crass animalistic together. And so then we meet you and you're like, hi, you know, like, like, like, like, can I borrow a cup of sugar or whatever?
2891000	2907000	And and I'm afraid Trump's gonna get elected to and look, there's Game of Thrones people. And it's like, and and then and then yeah, and it's like, I guess it's just the it is that's that's that's sort of typifies that that that border, which I don't think will like, but it doesn't it doesn't bum you out.
2907000	2913000	Like, like, it doesn't make you it's not like I'm really sad that you and your girlfriend aren't banging watching my.
2913000	2931000	We usually just watch and then we end up like touching ourselves on each other. We don't like we don't like put the laptop open and then I'm like, we're both watching. Do you want to try that? No.
2931000	2956000	But what out of all these categories, I'm gonna buy one of the prop 60 thing, but out of all that, there's all the categories. It's funny how porn is so like, like, it's the internet how it's like regimented sexuality, but that also, I think is a step towards it's like you can you can mark your your transition if you were to become curious about bisexuality, you could like drift in categories and tag clouds and things.
2956000	2969000	And you can kind of like, it's more superviseable and curateable by the person's own discretion. But what these categories that all exist, like, are there ones that are your favorites, not because they cause or maybe it's because they cause the most pleasure.
2969000	2982000	Maybe it's because they're the easiest for the most money or whatever. Like, what are your agent calls and says, I got a boom, boom, boom, and a boom, boom, boom, boom, like, like, like, which one makes you go fucking sweet, like, like, I want more of those.
2982000	2992000	Well, I definitely love like blowjob scenes, because usually those are like in and out in two hours. And so that's like, really nice.
2992000	3003000	I mean, it's not all too. There's a lot of prep time, like, you know, an hour's worth of makeup, you know, in the makeup chair, kind of a thing. I knew those dicks were fake.
3003000	3013000	They're impossible. So it's like, there's a lot of there's like certain scenes that I hate working for, which like, I mean, Reality Kings, it's like, I love them.
3013000	3029000	But I also hate because a lot of their stuff is like, they're not even shooting sex the whole time. They're shooting ad shots, which are like, you know, those little gifts on the side of Pornhub, basically, that it's like, you know, the obvious fucking even though, like, you can see over the counter, but you're, you know, it's supposed to be like relative.
3029000	3047000	So like, that guy technically doesn't see even though he's like, under the desk eating or pussy or whatever the fuck. Yeah. So like, there's like a lot of that where we'll spend so much time just shooting like, these ad based shots where it's just like, over and over like these 30 second clips, and they're like, want so many of them. And it's like, we're not even doing sex things.
3048000	3059000	Or like, I hate VR porn, because like, that's like, I'm supposed to be like, making out with the camera. So like, now I'm like, having sex with like, a camera, like, like, literally, if this is the camera, they want me to go.
3061000	3068000	I just saw a VR one, I just got my vibe system. So I saw a VR one with you in it. It's you're a bridesmaid with another.
3069000	3083000	And then all VR porn right now is just it's just a point of view video. Well, no, all the time, the guys like legs and dick are, are just like below frame. And then there's just like women coming in and going, What are you doing?
3083000	3096000	What do you think that dick is important? All right, let's see what's going on. Because the guy can't do anything, or you'll get seasick, like, he can't like get up and start.
3096000	3112000	The it's dangerous, like there's like these cameras aren't expensive. A lot of amateur pornographers are grabbing them and going, let's make a VR porn you put on the helmet and you're like, what the fuck?
3112000	3137000	That was a that was the new glass that Jane kick started for me. And tell me now, no, no, no, Chris, Riley, do you do you watch porn porn? Is there is a porn? That's a good question. He's a he's a good interviewer.
3137000	3163000	Now, I never would have thought to answer that. It's like, like, you're your therapist as a therapist. Yeah, I only watch anime porn. Anime porn. Yeah. Which is what I used to like before porn. I didn't like watching boy on girl sex to me, like the penis on camera kind of looked weird. So I would watch lesbian sex or anime porn. What's the what's the allure of anime porn for you?
3164000	3187000	I think that it's just like, ultimately super fantasy. And also, now that I know most of the performers, it kind of makes it different. So you're too critical because I can only watch British comedy. Yeah, I mean, I think so. And like, sometimes even that doesn't do it for me. Sometimes I just have to look at pictures. It's like, just the picture alone is enough because I can create my whole own imaginary entity.
3187000	3188000	Exactly. I can't watch New Girl because I'm like, I know Heather, Heather, Mary, whether I don't know her, obviously, I don't know her fucking name. Liz, Mary, whether and I was like, like, I met her and I respect her and she said that. So I can't watch I can't watch New Girl because like, if they if they do a joke, and then it goes to commercial, I'm like, that's an act break. And then I'm like, you're a dick. And like, like, like, it's like, like, it's too much. It's too I spend too much time all day obsessing over these things. I can't just watch like parks and rec, like, usually, and like, without
3217000	3247000	like being drawn into conflicting voices in my head. Well, and if I'm with a girlfriend or something, they inevitably just get the impression that I'm like this fucking asshole. So like, yeah, like, I'm super picky about my blowjob. So if you're watching a bad blowjob, if a Reagan is like, hacking it up on the yeah, no, I know. If you're like, if you're just making the sounds, and I'm just like, you're not even doing anything. Like, I'm just so yeah, I rally or anybody here has anybody done porn star karaoke
3247000	3277000	at sardos, up in the valley. No, there is a karaoke place. There's a hand being raised over there. Yeah, you've done it. We have done porn star karaoke. We're not porn stars. But we have done. Right. Is it monthly or weekly? Or what is it? Weekly? Yeah, I went there once sardos is like on pass, right? Yeah. In Burbank. Like, your first date. Wow. You know how to treat a lady. I love that.
3277000	3307000	That's my wife. Sorry, I just moved to the Catskills. Near Warner Brothers is a place called sardos. They do karaoke. But weekly, there is porn star karaoke. And I went there once did not know that my friends invited me. And it was, I was like, what the fuck? That's Stephanie Swift. Like, that's somebody like I knew, like, and I guess people that like you kind of vaguely recognize, because you know, I've seen porn. And they get up there.
3307000	3336280	Here's the thing about porn star karaoke. Competitive as shit. They're not having fun. They're actually trying to win karaoke. And on the tables at sardos. This is true. There's little slips of paper. I haven't been there. This has got to be eight years ago or so. Little slips of paper on each table that said, Hey, respect our neighbors. Don't fuck on their lawns or in their backyards. Because apparently the porn stars were getting out like doing karaoke and then banging.
3337000	3367000	On the nearby private property. And they actually have like he did devil in blue jeans. He knows that's mine. I do black velvet. They have to be uptight about something. So they funnel it into like something that's right. So all right. So prop 60. Let's talk about that. Because like the debates are tonight. Some of them are DVR. Like California voters are gonna go in. You're gonna be standing in your neighbor's garage or at some elementary school. And then this fucking thing is dropped on you without warning. It's like you have to have an opinion about condoms and porn and all this stuff. So we already had the whatever the prop was.
3367000	3397000	And that went through. Right. So there was like a condom law. Yeah. There's a measure B which already went through which by technically we're supposed to use condoms when we're shooting porn. But there's like no penalty if we don't. So nobody even does. So I'm gonna describe an ad to you that I saw tonight because and then you like let's get your perspective on this because it's very from talking to you a very deceptive ad. There's a woman on camera and she looks very sad. And if her
3397000	3426880	sad but she's like I I there's loopholes in the condom law and people take them and we need we need a law that prevents the loopholes too. And I'm an adult film actress and I got AIDS from doing a adult film and all this stuff. And it's it's it's very sad. And it seems very serious. And it leaves you with the choice between not caring about someone's life and like voting for this law. Now you tell me how many how many people have gotten AIDS from doing porn in the last decade.
3427000	3456280	Well, there hasn't been anybody who has contracted actual HIV from porn for the last 11 years. So this whole condom law is very misleading or in the way that they try to sell it as trying to prevent HIV or other STI STDs. And I myself I've been shooting for five years and I've never contracted gonorrhea or chlamydia or any and those are actually like these are very common. You had it would be like workplace. Yeah, exactly. It's very common.
3456280	3485920	It happens a lot in the industry. But you haven't even even I myself in five years I have never contracted an STD. So and I personally the regulation now today is every 12 days we get tested. It was prior I think it's either in a been a year or two that it's been 14 days but prior it was every 30 days. And we all collectively agreed. We're like, oh, we feel like we should be, you know, to if we because we were having a couple like
3485920	3515800	scares, like we have false positives that come up. And then, you know, there's a whole like, I can't think of the word. But you know, when they collectively get everybody together, and they're like, Okay, you guys are possibly, you know, you possibly have a triage or what's a quarantine? Yeah, there we go. Like a quarantine kind of a thing. So they'll like get these people. But even in all the scares, like it's been 11 years since anybody has actually contracted. I mean, that's a lot of people who did back when there was it was people who
3515800	3540280	do like anal cream pies were the girls who got a AIDS HIV. So like, even with my within my industry or my agency, none of us do anal cream pies. Because that was the proof like other girls who worked with the same performers who did anal sex or regular cream pies, they didn't contract the disease, as opposed to the girls who shot like anal cream pies, they were able to contract the disease.
3540280	3566000	So we have pre condom, despite what you might think about the condom law that's already been voted in, and which isn't up for being repealed, we're not voting for that. This is like a big piece of like duct tape, and then some that someone wants to put over the existing condom laws. Yes. The existing condom laws are already there. And from what you're saying, before that condom law existed, this shit was being self policed by your industry.
3566000	3595640	Yes, it's not legally, it's not by legal rights that we have to be tested. It's not like, you know, like when we shoot and they film us, they're like, hey, are you under the influence of any drugs or alcohol? Are you 18? Are you here under your own free will? There's never a question saying, are you tested? And are you clean? Like, so there's no like legal standard on this. But this is an industry standard that we've developed to be tested every 12 to 14 days. And now they want to like legally come in and demand that we wear pornos. And if it's not shown in,
3596000	3613000	every single frame of the porno that is, you know, being out there, that now any civilian can now sue us for 25% of the makings of this film or something along the lines, I can't I'm not totally sure with with the whole thing.
3614000	3640000	It's like, yeah, so just to repeat that, and maybe that like, like, yeah, if the condom isn't in every frame, which just imagine, I don't even do it. What a terrible porn movie. Like, my favorite shots are the master shots. First of all, like, I know, I'm not a huge fan of the of the point of entry, like, like close ups. Like, I like the I like the far away stuff. If there's a condom that visible, forget about that. Like, like the like, what is the agenda behind this?
3640000	3670000	Personally, what I take the agenda is that they want to move porn out of California. They want to move it somewhere else? Or do they just want California cleaner? I think they want California out like the porn industry out because even in the way that they if you guys like, check out your, you know, voters ballot, you know, check out your shit here. And you actually read on prop 60. It's really misleading because all it basically is telling you that it's like, let's stop spreading, you know, STDs in the adult industry and
3670000	3700000	bringing it into the broader community. Like, it's making it sound like we come in, we're like, jizzing all over you guys and giving you AIDS and shit, which is not nearly like I said, it hasn't been 11 years. It's been 11 years since we've had any contract in spite of people shunting you off into a relatively unregulated industry. And then it's also bringing this guy, Michael Weinstein, who is like the founder of AIDS Health Color Foundation or something like that. It makes him now he's going to be like inducted into like legislation where he will
3700000	3730000	now oversee all of porn and kind of like control all of porn in California. And I mean, this guy has also spent over $1.8 million of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, just on trying to get this, you know, bill in act. What's his angle? Like, what how does he profit or like, well, he'll be getting paid by taxpayers dollars once he is like, like, like the money that went into this, like,
3730000	3760000	the reason there's a commercial tonight during the debates, there can't there won't be another commercial because the porn industry would have to use its blowjob money to like make a national airtime. There's no way that we can compete with that. These people use AIDS research money. Yes, which should be going to better to make cancer. Yeah, like it should go to that stuff you're talking about earlier with leukemia. Yeah, that shit fucking fucking cancer.
3760000	3790000	Shit, kids. But yeah, I mean, I want to see an AIDS versus cancer movie, like, like Predator versus. If nothing else, do the research because you're a California voter and you're going to be like, it's just it's dropped in your lap. And it's like, like the key points here being you're not you're if you vote no on Prop 60. The only thing that you're affecting is just you're stopping. Well, no, you want to vote no on. No, that's what I'm saying. If you vote no on Prop 60.
3790000	3820000	You're not making any dramatic decisions about the course of people's lives, except that you're just like saying, like, like, like there's someone that's trying to do that. There's something that's trying to change things. And they're not make, they're not changing things to make there be less AIDS among porn stars or the community because that's not an issue. They're lying about that. They're misleading you about that. So a vote no on Prop 60 means what exactly?
3820000	3850000	Right. Yes, because it also sues it's not suing performers, it's suing producers. And because I produce my own content is if he's viewing something on my website, he will be able to sue me directly. Right. And he and it's, it's just crazy at how what it what it does and what it affects and how misleading it is because basically financial stoning law. It's like saying that if you see a porn star, you can throw. Yeah.
3850000	3880000	Financial rocks at them until they die able to do this is because now I have to display my legal name and my address publicly. And, you know, I have a huge fan base, but as well as other like transgender performers and gay performers who are more of a target, you know, towards violence than I am, you know, so it's like, now those kinds of people are set up for harassment, you know, people who want to harass a transgender, like maybe they're a super big fan, but they hate that they're a fan or fucking weird.
3880000	3910000	Shit. Yeah, like, yeah. Wow. Yeah. So no on Prop 60. Safe enough to say, no, I'm probably if there was anybody that had anything to gain from it. I mean, I don't know if it passes. I don't know what I'll be doing. I'll have to move. You'll be you'll be getting a law degree to defend yourself in small claims court against people. That's a big condom. All right. Well, do you mind sticking around?
3910000	3937260	Is it Jeff Cook? Jeff Cook? Are you Jeff Davis, Dan? I've known you for years. Is it is it Jeff? Is Jeff the the Cook brothers? All right. So I assume it's not Jeff or you would have said yes. Okay. Who's the who's the who's the Cook brother that sent me the video or that sent some of the video of the that Alex Cook. I was close. Alex Cook, come to the stage.
3940000	3968340	And you and this is your brother. You're the brother. What's your name? Lee Lee. Lee Cook. Okay, you guys there's microphones for you, right? You can have a seat, take some mics. So Alex, you sent this video. Like, I don't know how much of this is supposed to be a surprise. Like, it's like a wedding proposal or
3968340	3990940	there's like you sent a video that said you're a veteran. And you you you know, tongue in cheek owned, you're playing the veteran card. That's good. Fine card to play. I like you've served your country. You're out of the service. You've got you've got some you've you suffered some PTSD stuff or, or injuries or
3991260	4004820	No, no injuries. Just kind of acclimating to being a civilian again after the army getting over everything. And you got your little brother here and you guys are from where? I live in Florida now. But he's stationed at Camp Pendleton. Now he's a Marine currently.
4007020	4019460	So Alex, you are your retired army? Or are you still active? No, I'm out. I was in for about five years. I went to Iraq for a year in Afghanistan for a year. And now Lee, you're active Marine.
4019580	4023060	Yeah, I'm in the Marine Corps based Camp Pendleton in San Diego.
4023180	4026140	Oh, yeah. I have you been shipped out or?
4026340	4033420	No, I basically just hang out in California and get drunk a lot. I had a little easier.
4033420	4040780	My only problem with Camp Pendleton is a Del Taco under there that I got the worst food poisoning in my fucking life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you know what I'm talking about.
4040780	4056100	Yeah, right next to that. Yeah, I know. Totally. Totally. So Alex, it's hard to find fault with anybody that does play the veteran card, which is a fully valid card, but also you seem to love your your brother very much and speak very highly of him.
4056380	4067220	And in your video, what you're saying to me is you, you know, he's in the service, you were in the service and you just thought maybe because you guys are both big fans of the show that
4068060	4074500	if you came up here and made it more important that maybe you your agenda was to maybe
4076220	4080420	Well, we wanted to talk to you either didn't need to be on stage. This is awesome
4081180	4082340	but
4082340	4087740	yeah, we just wanted to be able to talk with you and the fact that we've had all these different experiences that
4088220	4094940	I don't know if a lot of your fans kind of you know, the nerdier type people don't tend to be in the military. So
4094940	4109940	Right. What was your MOS in the army? Pretty nerdy one. I was a 46 Romeo, which is a broadcaster. So I I shot video and stuff, but I was in an infantry unit and went with them to Iraq. And you were an army nerd. I love that. Yep.
4110940	4114940	46 Romeo. I love what about you, Lee? I eat tanks.
4114940	4125940	I'm a engineer. So like basically demolition, construction, c4, shit like that.
4125940	4139940	So what is that? So but you know, I mean, your video, maybe I'm maybe I'm gilding the lily. I don't know. I thought your video was like, you kind of like, am I putting words in your mouth and saying, I'd like to talk to my little brother, like, I'd like to kind of talk him out of serving.
4139940	4147940	Oh, no, I don't think I need to. I'm almost done. And then I'm home free. I thought, well, here's what I saw in the video.
4148940	4168940	Meaning what? You're gonna? Yeah, I got like, 11 months left. And then I'm getting out and moving back to Florida and hanging out. And retiring or? No, I'll I haven't been in long enough to like officially retire and get like pension and stuff like that. But I'll use the GI Bill. I want to go to school for music.
4168940	4171940	And so I'll go do that in Florida and hang out. Yeah, well done.
4174940	4195940	Yeah, the two, the two things that hit my mind were like, well, number one, this is a pretty contractual issue, I think you're in it until you're out of it. And number two, correct me if I'm wrong, but if your brother's enough of a sociopath that a podcast would convince him to not risk his life or risk his life, then maybe he's the kind of heartless killing machine we need in the armed services.
4196940	4213940	I mean, like, like, that's where that's where we want people that are like, that programmable and deadly. Who has a better who are or who are who are doesn't make any sense. It's not a real sound. It's not because you really could do a good who
4214940	4241940	All right, that was my answer. Neither. So your experience Lee has been a lot easier than your older brothers and you say the same training and all this stuff, but you're you're coming up in 11 months on your you'll go home and you got training you got the GI Bill Alex you you you you were in the shit albeit a nerd in the shit you had a you were you were shooting.
4242940	4254940	Probably is it worse is it what's your you're more isolated. Definitely, you know, you can't throw out with all the with all the meatheads out there, you know, you're those guys have all the fun.
4256940	4261940	Wrestling each other because they have to have an intimate relationship with Daleks. Where were you stationed?
4261940	4282940	I was stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, the hundred first Airborne Division, but went to Iraq for a year in East Baghdad, solder city, and then Iraq, Afghanistan for a year in East Afghanistan. So when you're doing what you did out there, like, where physically, like, are you like, what's your what's your home base like,
4283940	4308940	it's called a forward operating base or fob. That's where we lived. And in Iraq, it was the old Ministry of Intelligence, I think, like Saddam Hussein's Ministry of Intelligence, that we kind of just moved into. So it's like big old cement buildings. And then in Afghanistan, it was just kind of a camp that we set up with tents on gravel. And, but you know, I go out on patrols and missions and stuff like that with the guys to shoot videos.
4309940	4323940	Lee, what would it mean right now? If you got sent out, like, what where we are, like, as the US right now, if Trump invaded Mexico, if a marine got sent out to the desert right now, I don't know, are they still deploying Marines out there?
4324940	4343940	Uh, yeah, the right now is kind of a peacetime Marine Corps. They're basically making moves like we do muse marine, something fucking is an acronym, you go on a boat, you go on a boat and you visit Asian countries, and you like show your force around the world. And like,
4343940	4361940	that sounds nice. And I have some buddies that are in like, Lithuania and shit just showing that we exist. But for the most part, we're just doing like, peacetime, like, building hearts and minds missions and stuff like that. So if I went anywhere right now, it'd probably be a pretty uneventful deployment, just
4362940	4379940	photo ops, where you hand a blanket to a hurricane survivor. But at your age, Lee, like, let's say you were deployed overseas, and you're an active Marine. Anything that happened right now, like, like some serious shit could go down, like you could be.
4380940	4407940	Yeah, yeah, you'd be thrust right right in there. Yeah, that's a actually that's like, so super recently, deployment opportunity has come up for next year sometime. And it's a six month deployment. And but by the time it ends, all have supposed to have been out of the Marine Corps for one month. So I can do a six month extension to go on the deployment or not go and get out early. And it's like with my luck, I'll lose my legs or something.
4407940	4435940	Or I could go and do that and like take the gamble. So like, what's what's the, what's the upside for you? Like a bigger pension or? Well, it's a, it's total brainwashing to because like, I haven't been deployed or anything like that. And we live in a, like me everyday life is around all these people who like, oh, yeah, I was there for the initial push in Fallujah or whatever. So like, I'm at a lower status than them.
4435940	4464940	Based off my experience in the military. So like you have that just ingrained into you since day one, that you want to go out and do things and stuff like that. But then you also get like, you don't pay taxes for the time that you're deployed, you get like combat pay, you get like, you can you can you can do that by losing a billion dollars. Yeah, you get that. You don't even have to be in a tent. Sorry, I cut you off. No, no, no, no, you're I got to I was very lucky that I got to go, I got to go, I got to go, I got to go.
4464940	4493940	I got to go perform like for some US shows, like for Marines and army and some air bases. And we also got to go to some Bethesda and Walter Reed, like the hospitals for the world, most of the marine, the wounded Marines are at. And it was fucking crazy, man, like, like, that's, everybody's blown to bits and, and some of the nicest, like, coolest people you ever met, like, but like, like, it's like, it's nuts.
4493940	4511940	Yeah, and what, just like people getting blown to bits, like, I, I obviously have never seen it firsthand, but I work with people and I'm around people so often that have had that, like, right now, I actually got tasked out. So I just check IDs at the gate. And I'm like, Welcome to Camp Pendleton, have a nice day.
4511940	4532940	But uh, there's this old dude who calls himself Agent Whitehead. And he has like, he has a retired military ID, so we have to let him on base. But he's always like saying that he can like mind control people and stuff like that. And he has like, two prosthetic legs. But like, he's a Vietnam vet. So like, like that dude got messed up.
4532940	4561940	Where are you guys at? I want to know a lot more about Agent Whitehead. That's classified. Can we get him on the show? For all we heard. He's in the back right now watching us through night vision goggles. And where are you guys at politically? I mean, like, like, like, there's been this tradition, like, I, you know, you, oh, I'm a reporter.
4561940	4578940	Oh, I'm a Republican. So I'm into war and strong armed forces and defense and all that stuff. But it's like Truman was a Democrat. And he was a civil rights advocate and, and dropped the bomb on on Roshma and Nagasaki. Get the other one right, Dan.
4578940	4602940	These words have changed so much, like politically, though, like, like, from you guys span a couple years now in the armed services, like the guys are gals around you. Are they are they right wing, like, to the mostly right wing to the max? And are they pretty like kind of like, like, do they say like, like shit that makes you like crazy?
4603940	4616940	One thing I find a lot in that, like, I'm as left as you can get just about slightly less than him, maybe. But like, one thing I find is like, yeah, Trump sucks, but
4617940	4626940	right. And that and that and that shrug is like, there's the world in that shrug. It's like, I mean, I got women by the pussy too.
4626940	4651940	Our forefathers did. The Yeah, I mean, well, so how do you reconcile being politically liberal? Do you, do you disguise yourself when you're if you're surrounded, you're in a cut? Because I imagine there's right wing people in Hollywood that kind of like, they probably feel a little clammed up, like, like, they don't want to alienate themselves, it could cost them money, it could cost them livelihood.
4651940	4670940	I don't know how many it just doesn't go with the territory. But then again, they must exist. So what do you guys do when you're in a tent or a barracks or at some army term, military term? And people say something like, like, like, like, do you engage and go like, no, I'm gonna change your hearts and minds?
4671940	4696940	I can't speak for him. But I personally am like, let me tell you why you're wrong. And then I go into a spiel. And I'm like, I'm the only liberal Marine ever. So yeah, I was I definitely stayed more quiet when I was in the army. And this was, like, I deployed to Iraq in 2003. So it was pretty recent after 911. And everyone was kind of like, ramped up to go over there and kill people.
4697940	4698940	What was your unit?
4699940	4708940	I was in the 506th Infantry Regiment in the 101st Airborne Division, which is actually technically the Band of Brothers guys from HBO thing.
4709940	4725940	We did our USO shows, we did shows for like, NATO, like doctors, it's like you do comedy for them, like you can reference Voltaire and they dig it. We also did a show for the Big Red One, which is straight up infantry grunts, and they were just like,
4725940	4740940	proud, you know, murderers. And they were great fun. But like, their job is to go in there. They're for an audience. They're a tip of the spear. And if you didn't do a joke about blowing shit up or fucking and sucking, they weren't digging it.
4741940	4755940	I imagine you have to get to that space in order to I mean, your job, if you're going to do it well, or even if you're not invested in doing it well, but you're only invested in maintaining your sanity, you obviously, I mean, that's the definition of a soldier, right?
4755940	4772940	You have to you have to leave your humanity at the door, you have to become a machine. Because you because the hierarchy and everything, it's like reliant even. That's the weird thing about this country is that we act like there's this like left and right hand, but it's like the lefties in our country argue that we need thicker body armor.
4772940	4801940	Like, like, like, there's a goddamn ambidextrous. We're a right of center empire. Why wouldn't you be right of center? If you were an empire, you would be conservative, because you'd like things to be the way they were yesterday, more so than for it to have them change. And it's our behavior that would indicate that we we are a we are we we have people in our country that vote and pay taxes and speak very loudly about how incredible it is.
4802940	4825940	We are incredibly left we are. But when we measure our country as a collective and observe our behavior, we are we are full on into into blowing shit up, we're full on into occupying spaces influencing democracy across the globe, depending on our interests, like we are, we're down to fuck.
4825940	4830940	And so what is my point?
4830940	4859940	I don't think I mentioned this in the little video, but I guess I guess my point was just that if I got drafted, if I was, I was not 43. And I wouldn't immediately have a million reasons why I couldn't, but it's like, like, I would, I would absolutely I mean, like, I, you know, there's only one path, like, you would have to go like, okay, yes, yes, like, I surrender all of my critical thinking, because otherwise, I'm going to keep fucking up and I could, I could, I could hurt somebody, I could, I could fuck something up for everybody.
4859940	4869940	If I'm not, if I'm not, if I don't just put blinders on and just like, like, like, I gotta just like, I wouldn't be capable of doing it successfully. But like, like, that would be my choice.
4869940	4885940	That's that's, for me, that's a shitty thing. It's like, the more you think the stupider you are, like, if, if someone is like, hey, you fucked up, so you got to go do lunges up and down the hallway for five hours or whatever, you're like, okay, I'm gonna go do lunges for no reason.
4885940	4902940	And I'll think about something else. Like, there's no, there's no opportunity as a lower ranking person to be like, I'm smarter than my leader. I have a better frame of mind than him a better, like, geopolitical understanding of the situation than him or her.
4902940	4914940	So I'm gonna make this decision. Yeah, I don't even want that in my editor. You know, I got a on a sitcom that will that will cost money and make us worse television.
4914940	4923940	Like, you need blind loyalty. I'm sorry. Riley, do people in the porn industry ever get asked to go to USO shows? Like, do they go perform with the troops?
4923940	4935940	I mean, I get asked to the military ball once a week, but people go out and perform like the troops would flip if you came out there.
4935940	4939940	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't personally go and perform like sex shows.
4939940	4950940	I'm not saying you get on stage and do like porn. If you went out there and just like shook hands and said hello and like met people, they'd freak out.
4950940	4954940	Probably a lot of the locals would be pretty upset about it, to be honest.
4954940	4964940	The locals like in Iraq and Afghanistan, they're Muslim country. So porn was not allowed at all in the military. But obviously, every I'm sure I first saw.
4964940	4973940	I've sent many awards. Yeah, I've sent many. I send care packages to guys in the army very often.
4973940	4977940	Well, all right. What is in that care package, Riley?
4977940	4978940	My pannies.
4978940	4980940	Chocolate candies.
4980940	4990940	So your service to our country and your love of your brother has gotten you up here. And we're very, we're very fascinated to hear from you. You're a good egg. Like, like, what do you what do you want to do with this opportunity?
4990940	5001940	Is there any albums to plug or any any any props? If you're yes on 60, you know, let's hear your counterpoint or what? Yeah. Anything you want to say?
5001940	5012940	No, I don't think we have any plugs. We just wanted to be able to chat with you. And is there anything when you're listening to the podcast that you're like, well, geez, none of these people on stage or listening are in military service.
5012940	5023940	If they knew what we knew, maybe is there is there anything that you've heard heard us express that you're like, well, come on.
5023940	5034940	I've got a few. I'll read it on Jeff's Twitter later. Are you saying, Lee, that Alex has talked you out of going into active service? Like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
5034940	5055940	Like, so I have a daughter and she was born when I was 18. And I was like, well, I'm not gonna finish college. So I'm gonna join the military and have a life that way. And so that's why I joined. And then I was like, I was already super liberal and shit like that before that. And yeah, I'm ready to get out.
5055940	5077940	And and I think it adds to the story a little bit that our dad is a career military army officer. And so we spent our lives as kids moving around every two years around the world. And our parents are very conservative. So we definitely grew up in that world. And, you know, had to figure out like a great scientific thing. Was he a hardcore dude? Or is it?
5078940	5086940	I don't know if you know what parade rest is. But when my dad was angry at me, that's how I stood in front of him, which is a military position of attention. What is that?
5090940	5093940	And for how long? Feet shoulder width apart, hands behind your back.
5094940	5098940	Really? Like what would be that? I'd get beat and then I'd go to bed and less than learned.
5099940	5101940	Spare the rod.
5106940	5121940	Well, like, here's what I would do these shows. And I met these officers. I met these enlisted men and women. They were like, hey, Jeff, you should really. You ever think about being an officer? I'm like, no, I hate. You're too smart. I hate being told what to do.
5121940	5133940	Yeah, but all officers hate being told what to do. I was like, yeah, but I would be in jail the whole time because I don't like all these fucking rules. They're like, yeah, that's what all great generals say. I'm like, you're freaking me out.
5135940	5150940	Something I've never understood. Maybe you guys can clarify this. If you're nerds and you're in the military, like, and you've experienced this, like, am I mistaken in assuming that no matter who's been president through the span of our country's history, there's never been like a dramatic,
5151940	5178940	like, I know that Republicans are better at starting entire wars, like, and I guess that's better for the military, but I don't think you guys think like that when you're in that line of work. I don't think you're like, like firemen don't go, oh, this guy's pro fire. Like, I want him to be my candidate. Like, like, you're firemen. Your job is to put out wars. I mean, it's not like, like, like, in other words, like, like, it's not like it's like a jackpot. Like,
5179940	5190940	Yeah, it's your average Marine or your average army soldier. Like, are they gung ho? They want to kill motherfuckers. They want war. They are going to vote for whoever is most likely to start the next war.
5190940	5204940	But it's because of their ideology, right? It's not because of anything practical where it's like, Hillary Clinton from my, as far as I know, just like Obama before her, Bill Clinton, like, like, like, these aren't, these aren't people who reduce the amount of fucking up people we do, are they? No.
5204940	5230940	They are like, like the defense budget stays the same and increases at the rate that it increases. Correct. I think the only president that hasn't declared war was like Carter. I think like, like, like every Democrat that except for him, maybe has, as it's almost like the president doesn't matter at all, except when he's a fucking lunatic that like can actually, she, I don't think we would have invaded Iraq if, if Al Gore had been president. That's like the classic example.
5230940	5250940	You can't just picture that happening. But, but, but, but you spent your military career and got your GI Bill played. You've been at Camp Pendleton. You haven't been stationed in a country that we're occupying or fighting it. Our defense budget continues to just, it's more important than education.
5250940	5279940	That shit better fucking pay for my college or I'm going to be. Yeah. But we have bad news for you while you've been gone. We've made your college education worthless. Enjoy it. Enjoy your degree in fucking whatever. But because we haven't valued education as much as we have defense. And for that reason, it just, it kind of confuses me when I see like video footage of like, you know, rooms full of hardworking men and women that are salt of the earth.
5279940	5308940	That grew up in lower middle-class neighborhoods and who volunteered or, or it's for, for military service who are like so invested in who becomes commander in chief of our military. And it's like, you don't think Obama is going to like, like be a boon to your industry. I was in Afghanistan when Obama was inaugurated and it was like a funeral out there. Everyone was because they think he's going to what, you know, like pull back from all Muslim countries. I'm a secret Muslim. And I hate, I hate blue and brown people. Like, like, even if he doesn't want to, he's going to do it.
5308940	5318940	Like, like, even if he did pull everybody back, he'd assign you to the attorney general's office so you could go raid dispensaries. Like, like, there's always work for a hypocritical politician to assign people who know how to kill people.
5318940	5321940	Alex, what you say is a funeral. What was the mood on base?
5323940	5335940	Everyone was just disappointed, distraught, like just thought it was the worst thing that could happen to our country that you didn't really love America, you know, saying, Obama, it's one letter away from Osama, like, and really meaning it.
5335940	5338940	His middle name is Saddam Hussein.
5339940	5340940	Same shit.
5341940	5351940	So we don't want to think that about our military. Like, I want to think of them and police as like people who are so close to the action and that they know the nuts and bolts, that there would be a culture shock in a conversation with them.
5351940	5365940	And the politics would be different, but it would be because of, of real things. It wouldn't be because of hypnotism. Like, like, like for somebody who actually has to be the one whose hand is on the lever or finger on the trigger.
5366940	5380940	I would expect them, I would grant them the right to be so hardcore right wing because of their real basic, like, fundamental philosophy and the risks that they take and stuff. But it's disappointing to hear that it's more like, yeah, as in the trailer park.
5380940	5394940	So in the military watch, they watch Fox News in the, in the, uh, where you, they just, because it's like, it's almost like that makes the job separate from the ideology that it's like, well, the job is to have to deal with the repercussions of how we think.
5395940	5398940	But like, we're, we don't like, they're just thinking the same shit.
5399940	5402940	You have to think that way to be happy doing that, right?
5402940	5411940	Yeah, but I, yeah, and I'm trying to bounce out because I'm like, I don't get it. Like, I feel like if I'm a soldier and Obama gets elected, I'm like, that dude's going to blow up shit like nobody's business because he's a Democrat.
5412940	5431940	The, the, I think you just barely touched on it maybe, but like, like the whole Colin Kaepernick, uh, kneeling for the flag, uh, national anthem and shit like that. People are like, he hates the troops, but it's more like, why does disagreeing with certain things America has a trend?
5432940	5439940	For standing for mean that you don't appreciate the people that go and fight for the things that you do happen to stand for.
5440940	5443940	It doesn't, you know what I'm saying?
5444940	5455940	And, and you know, there's, there's liberal nerds in the military and there's, there's all, all different stripes in the military. There's definitely that mainstream right wing go kill Muslims culture, but I don't want to shit all over everyone.
5455940	5466940	You know, I met other nerds there and other bright people that that's the conflict that we're in. That's the last thing we want to do. But like, you know, that is the thing like, it's like, that also gets taken advantage of in the nineties.
5467940	5480940	We developed this phrase, support our troops. Like, like we, we, we were like, because we, we figured out that like, like, oh, who the hell can't support our troops? What are you a monster? You're talking about young men and women like risking their lives for our country.
5480940	5491940	But it was like, if it wasn't support our troops, it would be support the war. And it's easy to not support a war. It's impossible to not support the troops. And so that's an abusable ideology.
5491940	5504940	It's like, like, like, like, and so we, it was a state side when we get reminded of the fact that like, oh, in Vietnam, and then these poor kids came home and we spin on them because if we confuse them with the people that sent them there, we'll never going to make that mistake again.
5505940	5514940	But that growth on our part was absolutely abused by a war machine that want that, that told us, yeah, don't do that anymore, ever again. And no news coverage and blah, blah, blah, support our troops.
5514940	5527940	And it was like, it was, it was used for fucked up purposes. And like, like, so we sit over here and we go, like, I don't even know what the fucking like, like how to treat veterans, you know, it's like, except to say, and then you get this like empire where we just go like, well, I'm liberal.
5527940	5535940	So I want these guys who lost their arms and legs to be taken care of. I want them to have better armor on their humvees when they're patrolling the areas.
5535940	5544940	We're like, I'm a liberal? What? Like, like, like, all right. Okay. How do you guys feel about porn when you're not in Afghanistan? You like it.
5546940	5562940	I'm a fan. A plus. Now, Riley, here's maybe a little too intimate a question to ask you. But when you, are you a waxer, a shaver? How do you do it? I know where this is going.
5562940	5571940	I personally shave, but I do plan on getting like laser hair removal at some point. Now, Riley, do you know that you don't need to choose between price and quality?
5576940	5587940	To get an amazing affordable shave. Dollar Shave Club dot com. The answer. They support the troops. They support the troops. And also, if you don't like it, you get your first month free at Dollar Shave Club.
5588940	5591940	Dollar Shave Club.
5592940	5599940	Riley, did you know if you go to Dollar Shave Club dot com slash harmontown, you'll get a discount of some kind.
5600940	5610940	They'll actually come over and shave you. A representative from Dollar Shave Club comes over and just gives your genitals the perfect shave.
5611940	5618940	Seriously, I have no reason to deal with the drugstore hassle and the battle and battle the locked up razor fortress ever again.
5619940	5622940	What are we doing? What are we doing? What is our fucking show?
5623940	5631940	I've never seen a nickel from any of these things. We sell underwear and razors and I've never seen fucking freedom.
5632940	5636940	Jeff, I agree. It's insane that we've created a dichotomy between quality and price.
5640940	5649940	Especially with shaving equipment. Like, why can't the top notch shaving accoutrement also be the cheapest?
5650940	5659940	Are you saying that I should simply go to Dollar Shave Club dot com slash harmontown and pick a razor that works for me from their lineup of amazing blades?
5660940	5662940	Jeff, I can't control you.
5663940	5668940	It sounds like you're trying to tell me what to do. I don't want to be told what to do.
5669940	5678940	Like our great guests tonight, I can only share my experience with you. Riley Reid's done 437 movies and doesn't have AIDS. That says no on Prop 60 to me.
5679940	5690940	The Cook brothers say 11 months and out and I'd like to use my GI Bill. That says vote Democrat to me. But don't be fooled and think that they're not also hawks.
5691940	5699940	And all I can tell you from my experience is that I get a first class shave when I use the executive blade.
5700940	5705940	You have a beard. You have a full beard. This is all built on lions.
5706940	5710940	My brother actually just ran out of his Dollar Shave Club razors this morning. Hence.
5711940	5721940	And he's a veteran. So go to Dollar Shave Club dot com slash harmontown and support our troops. Even the lapsed ones.
5722940	5734940	As far as I'm led to believe, Dan, if all this liberal claptrap is to be believed, I can look and smell like a million bucks without paying for it.
5735940	5737940	That's Obama's America.
5738940	5755940	And in the interest of equal times, maybe you're a Republican. So think of it this way. When you do grab your lover by the pussy, don't you want it to be a smooth, frictionless experience?
5756940	5759940	Here's your chance.
5760940	5765940	Don't just flock to Dollar Shave Club dot com. Don't associate them with my liberal agenda is what I'm saying.
5766940	5773940	This country may need walls around it. We may need an orange rotting pumpkin for a president.
5774940	5778940	And we're still going to need to shave. And we're still going to want those shaves to come.
5779940	5782940	But only if you type in slash harmontown.
5783940	5792940	Well, that's that'll get you a discount. If you go there and type in slash Mark Marin, I don't know what's going to happen.
5793940	5796940	Weird will get longer. Mark Marin.
5797940	5802940	You'll get a more successful shave. But you know, I didn't.
5803940	5813940	We haven't we haven't had the president on here, you know, like so here we are telling you it's Dollar Shave Club dot com slash harmontown.
5814940	5820940	It's just a few bucks a month. No long term commitment. You get a box full of shaving stuff. Is that right? Is that right?
5821940	5823940	Jesus, I hope so.
5824940	5826940	Or the lights are going to start going out.
5827940	5832940	We're supposed to do an ad for a tuxedo company that promises me free suits. I'm very excited about it.
5833940	5840940	You answered your earlier question. There's a quarterly process. Feral audio is it has a corporate structure like you'll get your money.
5841940	5848940	I just feel so dirty right now. Maybe it's because I don't look and smell like a million dollars because of Dollar Shave dot com.
5849940	5850940	That brings up anal bleaching.
5851940	5855940	Like my girlfriend slash harmontown.
5857940	5860940	My girlfriend. Your first anal bleach is free.
5861940	5866940	And if your assholes not perfectly bleached, will they send someone to bleach your asshole to your house?
5867940	5871940	Yes, I need to finish the sentence. My girlfriend so that people don't go to bed.
5872940	5878940	I think Dan was going to start saying is she she she got offered an anal bleaching.
5879940	5887940	Because she goes to she she gets like like like like like like there's a guy and it's like laser laser scrapings or so.
5888940	5892940	I don't know. She's like she's she has a she has a guy laser scrapers.
5893940	5904940	He's a derm. He's a guy. He's a skincare guy or like like like she's got very wonderful soft skin and like like like a fake doctor.
5904940	5912940	The but in one point he was like you. Oh he told her he said you know we do anal bleaching.
5913940	5915940	I think and then he looked at her butthole. He's like you don't need it.
5917940	5918940	Good for her.
5920940	5921940	Good for you.
5924940	5927940	More important to me than a bright white butthole.
5928940	5933940	I had one guy trying to tell my ethnicity by the color of my asshole.
5934940	5943940	He's like he's like quarter Cherokee and you're like like wriggling and like like like oh yeah tell more.
5944940	5946940	And then he's like oh my God don't go out tomorrow night.
5950940	5953940	And then he falls over and there's a poison dart in his back.
5954940	5962940	Do you do you. You can say I know those records are I don't do. I don't do like any alteration to my body at all.
5963940	5967940	So like my like I don't put fake nails on. I don't dye my hair. I don't do anal bleaching.
5968940	5971940	But you must certainly your need to shave once in a while.
5972940	5975940	Yeah I mean like I shave my legs but how much are you paying for your razor.
5975940	5985940	What about what about lifestyle diet exercise drinking drugs like like where are there. Do you have do's and don'ts and like are there sacrifices you make to me.
5986940	5992940	Yeah I mean I definitely like I don't. I used to like to skateboard and stuff like that and I don't do that anymore.
5993940	5997940	Scrape a knee. Yeah exactly. If I have a scrape on my knee I can't be booked or whatever.
5998940	6008940	But what about just like. Are you. Are you like. Do you have to push your endurance daily to like maintain a. No I'm. I don't work out or anything.
6009940	6017940	I mean I'm not being glad but like part of your work is exercise like. Yeah I mean I feel like I hit that daily heart rate thing.
6018940	6029940	I like to do a lot of the work like I don't like to just leave it up to the guy because you know I like to perform up to my standard and my quality of what I think.
6030940	6039940	As most women do. Yeah I mean and also I don't like to play dead starfish so I definitely. Do you. Do you have like parts of your body insured.
6039940	6049940	Because I feel like if I if I made my living off of being attractive and being appealing for other people to watch me have sex I would get my best parts insured.
6050940	6060940	I don't. I've heard of like some people do like Kieran Lee who is like you know big time browsers performer has like a million dollar insurance policy on his penis.
6061940	6071940	So it is insured with Lloyd's of London. They used to say that about like what's your name for it like there was a entertainment tonight hostess or music Gibbons or something like her legs are insured.
6072940	6083940	And a white smile or something like that. Didn't she have an insurance thing. I mean is that. Yeah I guess. Okay. No I don't. You could do that with anything. Can't you just that's like kind of like just a bad version of playing the stock market.
6083940	6098940	Like I could just say I'm going to ensure this snail with Lloyd's of London and then if it dies I put it and then stomp on it and collect the god damn money and they're like yeah we'll cover that for sixty dollars a minute until you stop on it and we'll pay you one hundred and twenty.
6099940	6103940	And there's a two minute moratorium on snail stopping.
6104940	6114940	I mean yeah I wouldn't I don't like insurance. I think I feel like insurance is like it's like like Dino says that dessert is where Western society like like where we peaked like that.
6115940	6121940	You knew once we started inventing food that we were just like no I'm not hungry but just a little more food just for the taste.
6122940	6135940	Like from everywhere that it's and I'm saying as far as capitalism insurance is the invention of the idea that like like oh hey man like nice pants. Yeah be a shame if something happened to him.
6136940	6146940	Are you you mean extortion. Well no I'm not going to do it. I think I'm almost certain I heard this exact sentence on bang bus.
6147940	6161940	I'll never forget getting an envelope from a judge. It was it was when Christopher Reeve was still alive and it was a the envelope was from an insurance company and it was identical to a fucking like extortion racket because it was a picture of post accident.
6162940	6168940	Christopher Reeve fell off a horse like injured his neck. It's like you're twenty five. I don't know. It's a Superman. I know. Okay.
6169940	6173940	There's been a lot of super super men so he didn't have horse insurance. That's the problem.
6173940	6187940	He and it's a picture of a visibly affected Christopher Reeve like he's like going like this and there's a quote next to the photo that I'm getting in the mail and it says don't let what happened to me happen to you.
6188940	6197940	Like what how is this not a note from a fucking criminal. How is this not identity. How is this not against the law. Don't you're threatening me.
6198940	6205940	Don't let what hat. What. That's what insurance is. It goes as a beautiful house beautiful family be ashamed of something happened.
6206940	6225940	Can I have sixty dollars. But they don't even the mafia is more honest because what they're saying is we'll do it. We'll destroy your house and your family. Give us sixty dollars. You just guaranteed it won't happen. That's more honest exchange of goods and services than insurance which is saying like I don't know.
6226940	6233940	Something might happen your house and you're like yeah something might for real like a mafia guy might extort me or a tornado might happen and they're like yeah all kinds of things sixty dollars please.
6234940	6241940	And then the tornado happens and then they send a guy that's like tornado. I don't know. Looks to me like you're an alcoholic maybe had a rough night.
6242940	6252940	The Tasmanian devil here. And we only insured you against tornados. They're spelled the same but they're pronounced different.
6253940	6255940	Yeah read the fine.
6257940	6267940	It's not insurance isn't a government agency which is why you know that their business is in making sure that your cancer your tornado your flood won't pay out there.
6268940	6278940	Business. That's what you know about them from the get go. The weird thing is that then they're all tied into the government because a guy with a gun can pull you over and demand to see their paperwork.
6278940	6285940	And if you're reaching for the glove box the wrong way and you're the wrong color. Welcome to the. Welcome to the angry grandpa portion of the show.
6286940	6297940	I just like I like to. I like to round up a group of soldiers and porn stars and just shake my cane. Guardians of vitality and violence.
6298940	6299940	Glend me your power.
6303940	6315940	I guess everybody go home and watch Westworld and just do the highlights of the debates. I saw him. She was it's just more of him fucking loud mouth and it and like interrupting her and he's like like like he spends the whole time going.
6316940	6324940	Can I tell you you let her go a minute. You let her go a whole minute. It's like an eight year old and I don't even care. I hate all politicians and I hate government but but I mean Megan Gans.
6324940	6337940	I was I was traveling today. I flew home as I was in a car and I recorded the debate. I'll watch it later maybe. And the only time I've ever truly loved Twitter was today because all of my funny friends were being hilarious.
6338940	6352940	But Megan Gans is a writer and worked on community. She was I mean it wasn't even a joke. She just she just wrote crying. You act professional and play by the rules and you get interrupted by men. And that that that to me says the fucking whole the whole shooting.
6353940	6363940	And he kept talking about how she gets to interrupt him and all this stuff. It was like you can't like that was my biggest fear is that she what she's working against is you can't you can't compete with him without looking dumber than you are.
6363940	6385940	Like like like because who would and she didn't get to choose her opponent like she like I always wanted to like like she the six hours after she wins two things are going to happen. The Republican Party is going to start maligning her by maligning him.
6386940	6403940	The Republican Party is already there and he basically disavowed him but they're going to six hours after her inauguration or election. They're going to they're going to start saying there's a there's a woman in the White House and the only reason is because she it was a one one woman race.
6404940	6416940	Yeah. Yeah. She went she went up against a weird orange guy from a Doritos commercial like they're going to be like it wasn't even a fair election. Hey Lee at Camp Pendleton is it very Trump. I mean I know they hate Hillary probably right.
6417940	6422940	What's super cool though is that at the same time it's in Southern California. So like on Camp Pendleton.
6422940	6435940	Well OK so like the debate that the debate that went on a couple of weeks ago I right now I just like scan IDs at the gate and I'm like you can come on you're brown you can't you can come on you're brown you can't because it's my job.
6436940	6446940	Jesus Christ fucking so all these people came through with like the Trump stickers and the Trump pass and they were like yeah Trump is stomping Hillary in the bait tonight and I was like yeah that he is.
6447940	6460940	But like once you once you leave Camp Pendleton and you like you go 30 minutes north or even down to like the gas lamp in San Diego and stuff suddenly you start seeing all these like Priuses with Bernie stickers and which is that that was our dude.
