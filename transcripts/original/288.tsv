0	8000	I love music, that's why I'm here today.
8000	10000	It's a beautiful love town in Burbank.
10000	12000	Harman Town is going to get in session.
12000	14000	May 20th, 2018.
14000	16000	You know there's something wrong with you.
16000	18000	Yeah, it doesn't have shingles.
18000	20000	It ain't comfortable like here then.
20000	21000	And there's nothing love can do.
21000	24000	And let me just say I'm gone.
24000	25000	So good.
25000	27000	You know, you be like, oh, lie there.
27000	29000	I'm from Snuggletown, USA.
29000	31000	The mayor of Harman Town.
31000	33000	And I'm a hip-hop.
33000	35000	I grew up to the mop.
35000	37000	So clean your mother's pussy until I hit
37000	40000	the top of the engineering industry.
40000	42000	I'm a custodian.
42000	43000	Don't cause me misery.
43000	44000	I started at the bottom.
44000	46000	Now I'm going to the top.
46000	48000	Because of the aforementioned mop,
48000	52000	I'm going to fuck your mama and rap.
52000	53000	All right.
53000	57000	Let me hear you say I don't feel so good.
57000	58000	Yeah.
58000	59000	It's good.
59000	60000	All right.
60000	61000	Stop it.
61000	62000	Stop the goddamn music.
62000	64000	It's got already got someone rapping on it.
64000	66000	That's Rob Tansham, everybody.
66000	71000	Our friend Rob with background vocals by our own church.
71000	72000	Whoa.
72000	73000	Yeah.
73000	75000	When's that coming out, that album?
75000	76000	Soon, right?
76000	77000	Church, you know?
77000	79000	Right now, tonight.
79000	82000	Get it at Best Buy.
83000	84000	That's something to look forward to.
84000	85000	It's good stuff.
85000	88000	It's about his own maniac, high anxieties
88000	91000	and weird cathexys, and it's beautifully written
91000	93000	and wonderfully.
93000	95000	Dan, I watched you record a piece on it.
95000	96000	It was very good.
96000	97000	Yeah, that's fun.
97000	99000	He worked very hard on that.
99000	101000	I guess you're not probably not...
101000	102000	No, you are supposed to tell people
102000	104000	you worked hard on your rap album.
104000	105000	Mm.
105000	107000	Rappers work hard on their albums.
107000	108000	Yeah.
108000	110000	Yeah, he worked very hard on it.
110000	112000	He worked very seriously.
112000	115000	And I think it's very impressive.
115000	117000	He had to kind of be talked into doing it
117000	118000	because he's like,
118000	121000	I don't want to do a white guy comedy rap album.
121000	122000	He's right to have those anxieties,
122000	125000	but the truth is he's so good.
125000	127000	Like, I was like, just do it.
127000	129000	Like, yeah, you're right.
129000	130000	It's like probably...
130000	132000	It's objectively on paper.
132000	134000	It's a corny concept,
134000	139000	but so is jumping over a high pole at the Olympics.
139000	141000	It's like, oh, I'm going to do that again.
141000	143000	Like, yeah, just do it.
143000	145000	How do you pick pole vault?
145000	147000	How do you go, like, that's my shit.
147000	149000	Yeah, I don't know.
149000	150000	It's weird, isn't it?
150000	151000	Because they're jumping,
151000	154000	but they're doing it with a big stick,
154000	155000	a big jumpy stick.
155000	156000	And then sometimes it snaps in half,
156000	157000	and what you have is a giant knife,
157000	160000	like two fiberglass knives in your hand
160000	163000	that can just impale you through your album.
163000	164000	Coming and going.
164000	165000	I mean, let's face it really.
165000	169000	What Olympic activities do we even approve of?
169000	171000	Like, maybe like running.
171000	174000	Running is good.
174000	175000	Swimming, I guess.
175000	177000	Swimming, you don't have...
177000	180000	There's never a cause in life to swim fast.
180000	181000	Yeah, let's not compete.
181000	182000	We're not going to out-swim a shark.
182000	184000	If you're swimming, we should do it as a team,
184000	185000	like not competitively.
185000	187000	Is it about causes in life or is it about this idea?
187000	188000	This is what I could never figure out.
188000	191000	This is the Olympic rhetoric that I never understood,
191000	192000	is this idea of like,
192000	194000	oh, it's about nations coming together,
194000	197000	but then it's also at the exact same time
197000	198000	it's about nations coming together,
198000	204000	it's about proving which country can be better,
204000	209000	and about the potential of the human potential.
209000	210000	It's quite a...
210000	213000	How quickly you can bankrupt a city or a country
213000	214000	by building a bunch of stadia
214000	216000	that are never going to be used again.
216000	221000	I mean, what if you drafted your team in the Olympics?
221000	223000	Like, you got all the skiers,
223000	229000	and then each country got to get everyone else's.
229000	231000	You know what I love is the biathlon in the Winter Olympics
231000	234000	where they ski and shoot, because that's some real shit.
234000	236000	Well, that's what calls into question
236000	238000	the whole endeavor of Olympics,
238000	240000	because it's like, why not fucking chess
240000	243000	if you can ski and shoot as a sport.
243000	248000	But if you're a Scandinavian homeless person with a gun,
248000	251000	you need to be able to ski around, not die,
251000	255000	and then kill your food and carry your gun on your back.
255000	257000	That's like some hunting.
257000	259000	Yeah, I mean, I think the Olympics
259000	261000	are a little silly at this point, right?
261000	263000	I think the only sport that really comes in handy
263000	265000	in day-to-day life is water polo.
265000	269000	Water polo is fun because you try to kill other people
269000	270000	for most of the game.
270000	272000	I keep finding myself in situations
272000	277000	where I'm in my underwear with a little cap on my head,
277000	280000	and you want to hold a ball above your head.
280000	284000	I want to throw a ball through a small net,
284000	287000	but there's never anybody else there to pass it to.
287000	290000	That's what satisfies me about water polo.
290000	292000	My driver, not tonight's driver,
292000	295000	but that's whoever my previous driver was,
295000	296000	because it brings up the thing.
296000	298000	It says, what did you think about so-and-so?
298000	302000	I believe my last driver is because I just clicked through,
302000	308000	but I think my last driver's name was Ushola.
308000	309000	How do you spell that?
309000	313000	U-S-H-O-L-A, Ushola.
313000	316000	I tipped him $20 because I was like,
316000	319000	this guy's life is a mess.
319000	321000	You can be a famous baseball player
321000	323000	named Pujols, and you're fine.
323000	324000	Yeah.
324000	325000	You got to get good at something.
325000	327000	Yep, yep.
327000	329000	He's good at using his name.
329000	333000	I went to the...
333000	336000	I'll talk about that later probably.
336000	339000	That's too thick.
339000	342000	Too thick a cut of beef for the beginning.
342000	343000	Not for the end initiative.
343000	344000	I need something lighter.
344000	345000	I was walking down the road today
345000	347000	and I saw a guy that looked so much like Spencer.
347000	348000	I almost went up to him and said,
348000	349000	are you trying?
349000	350000	Are you a big fan?
350000	352000	Because it looked like somebody
352000	355000	who had dedicated efforts to look like Spencer.
355000	356000	Where was he?
356000	358000	He was walking into a juice place.
358000	360000	Oh, yeah, that's not me.
360000	361000	Yeah, that's not you.
361000	362000	You should have set him straight.
362000	364000	If he wants to really pull off the Spencer thing,
364000	365000	he'd walk into the juice place.
365000	366000	No.
366000	371000	I started watching this new true crime show
371000	373000	called Cold Justice,
373000	375000	and it's like a very unusual show
375000	378000	because we're all familiar with cold cases now,
378000	379000	the appeal of those.
379000	382000	Well, this crime hasn't been solved yet.
382000	385000	It's these two women,
386000	388000	and they go from town to town.
388000	393000	The whole thing has this very uplifting mood to it
393000	396000	because these women come to your town
396000	399000	and solve your cold case for you.
399000	400000	Sure.
400000	403000	So the way it's edited,
403000	407000	it's just like it's just on this side of like,
407000	411000	it just feels more like a home improvement show.
411000	414000	The music and the editing of it are like,
414000	417000	so they roll in and they're like,
417000	422000	so Tiffany Johnson got sexually assaulted
422000	424000	and murdered 10 years ago,
424000	425000	and they can't figure out how it is.
425000	427000	Here's the police that couldn't figure out how it is.
427000	428000	Hi, how are you?
428000	430000	And then they go to the family
430000	435000	who have been unable to have closure for 10 years,
435000	436000	and they chat with them,
436000	437000	but they're very upbeat,
437000	439000	and they're doing bits,
440000	441000	not in front of the family,
441000	444000	but it's like the family's going to watch the show.
444000	445000	So then there's like,
445000	446000	it has like this like,
446000	448000	they try to create this little feeling of camaraderie
448000	450000	because they're working with the cops
450000	451000	and they're like,
451000	452000	hey, we're driving to the penitentiary.
452000	455000	We're going to talk to Ringo.
455000	458000	Anything you guys wanted to say to us?
458000	459000	That's a big 10-4.
459000	460000	If you could just get him to say
460000	462000	that he killed Tiffany Johnson,
462000	463000	that would be great.
463000	465000	Get him to say he murdered and raped her.
465000	467000	I mean, that's what we want.
468000	470000	And they're like, yeah, I wish.
470000	472000	Did they always get their man?
472000	473000	Yeah, they do.
473000	475000	They apparently do.
475000	477000	That's a put-up job.
477000	479000	And then the music kind of gets kind of lilting
479000	480000	and they come back,
480000	481000	they structure it,
481000	485000	so it's like you check in with the aggrieved family members.
485000	487000	And so then at the end,
487000	489000	it just feels very much like one of those shows
489000	491000	where you remodel your kitchen.
491000	492000	They're coming back and going,
492000	495000	guess who murdered your daughter 10 years ago?
495000	496000	It was the mailman.
496000	497000	You were right.
497000	498000	You were right.
498000	499000	I knew it.
499000	500000	I knew it.
500000	502000	You know how the criminal justice system
502000	504000	said it wasn't the mailman, but you did?
504000	505000	Well, you were right.
505000	508000	You know, I thought it was amazing.
508000	509000	I mean, it's a good show,
509000	512000	but it really was tasteless when they were like,
512000	514000	you know, we're about to reveal the killer.
514000	515000	Move that truck.
515000	516000	And then he's like,
516000	518000	the killer's behind a truck.
518000	519000	Which show is that?
519000	520000	Is it called Move That Truck?
520000	523000	No, it's a great joke and everyone loved it.
523000	525000	I watch a new show called,
525000	527000	it's about cold cases too,
527000	530000	but they make it look real sexy by the end of it.
530000	532000	It's called Pimp My Cold Case.
532000	535000	They put an aquarium in someone's coffin.
535000	536000	Yeah.
536000	538000	And at the end of it,
538000	541000	you're the boss of cupcakes.
541000	544000	Wait a second, Harmon.
544000	547000	I'll wait an hour and a half.
547000	549000	Every time they come on the show,
549000	550000	they solve a case.
550000	552000	Why aren't they the most famous detectives in the world?
552000	555000	I don't think these cases are all that cold.
555000	558000	I think it feels to me like basically,
558000	562000	they're just taking the budget and time that a television show affords
562000	567000	that a municipal government doesn't afford its victims
567000	572000	because it costs $500,000 and 48 hours
572000	575000	to detect semen a little better.
575000	577000	You know, act like you give a fuck.
577000	579000	Well, that's very depressing.
579000	580000	Well, if you think about it,
580000	582000	you know there's a dollar cost to this stuff.
582000	584000	You know that black people get murdered
584000	589000	and they don't fucking send David Caruso into a fucking black light lab.
589000	592000	No, but it's depressing that it's so easy to impact justice
592000	593000	that you could be like,
593000	596000	we've got a TV show, we're going to come in and fund the government.
596000	598000	I truly think that's what it is.
598000	602000	I mean, we know that that's essentially what the Innocence Project is.
602000	606000	It's like, holy shit, if you just bother to take the time,
606000	609000	not everyone turns out to be innocent, but holy crap.
609000	612000	It's like, you're up on your knees in your bed,
612000	616000	you're either about to make yourself a cocktail or a jerk.
616000	619000	Should I rub your nipple or do you need to handle this?
619000	620000	Either way you should.
620000	621000	Why can't it be both?
621000	623000	Right.
623000	627000	All right, speaking of perfect worlds,
627000	629000	our special guest tonight,
629000	631000	I told you guys this a thousand times, right,
631000	635000	that I went to the doctor and I was worried about my testicles
635000	638000	and getting to that age, I thought maybe I felt something
638000	641000	and then the doctor's like, well, do you want me to,
641000	642000	do you want me to feel them?
642000	644000	Yeah, well, it'd make me feel better.
644000	647000	And then he just started feeling myself.
647000	650000	I like caught myself, like I started touching my nipple.
650000	651000	I reached up.
651000	652000	No, no, no.
652000	653000	I was just making sure.
653000	655000	I was just making sure I already talked about that.
655000	656000	Oh, God damn it.
656000	659000	If that's a recurring thing, then we have to talk about that.
659000	664000	Our next guest has been seen in all media,
664000	668000	just like everyone else, because the world is now a hive mind
668000	678000	in which everyone has an equal chance to cause a riot in Tunisia
678000	680000	or die in obscurity.
680000	681000	It really doesn't matter.
681000	683000	Fame means nothing.
683000	689000	But if you like nice, interesting, good kids with hearts of gold
689000	695000	and minds like a labyrinth, and you like our friend Duncan Trussell,
695000	698000	this guy rolls in that crew, you know?
698000	700000	I call him the Pembertoons.
700000	703000	Please welcome Johnny Pemberton to my bed.
703000	711000	Oh, yeah, Johnny Pemberton to the stage.
711000	712000	Yeah, yeah, sorry.
712000	715000	We didn't really explain anything to you.
715000	716000	Hi, guys.
716000	719000	We've been working with the format a little bit since we lost our audience.
719000	720000	It's great.
720000	721000	It's a great new format.
721000	722000	It's a lot of new changes and stuff.
722000	723000	It's really good.
723000	725000	This could be big what's happening right now.
725000	726000	He's using all the mics.
726000	727000	He's about to.
727000	730000	Well, as I specified, I don't want to make a mistake.
730000	732000	Well, Johnny, Johnny's three mic Pemberton.
732000	735000	This is good, because we only had one guest lined up,
735000	737000	but you could actually fill in for three guests right now.
737000	738000	I'll do three.
738000	739000	What do you want me to do?
739000	740000	I'll get three.
740000	741000	You might already be.
741000	743000	Did you bring some clips from your new show, Pembertoons?
743000	745000	Yeah, do we have those clips, Pembertoons?
745000	747000	Can we roll one of the Pembertoons?
747000	750000	Pembertoons episode two is the best.
750000	752000	It's got a lot of new...
752000	755000	We've got Neil Patrick Harris and David Allen Greer playing each other.
755000	756000	You guys go skiing, right?
756000	759000	We go skiing in the summertime.
759000	763000	It's like a thing with wheels, like wheel skiing type thing.
763000	764000	Oh, hi.
764000	765000	It's crazy.
765000	766000	All right, well, let's check that out.
766000	767000	Click, click.
767000	768000	Boop, boop.
768000	770000	What's going on out here?
770000	772000	I'm David Allen Greer.
772000	776000	I shouldn't have been skiing in the first place, not on mud.
776000	778000	I'm Neil Patrick Harris.
781000	784000	I'm special guest Neil deGrasse Tyson.
784000	785000	Hey, Neil.
788000	790000	Timber.
790000	791000	Oh, shit.
791000	794000	How does all this work, Neil deGrasse Tyson?
794000	795000	I just got killed by a tree.
795000	796000	Don't ask me.
796000	798000	To space and beyond.
800000	801000	Wow.
801000	802000	So is it kind of...
802000	803000	Yeah, it's good stuff.
803000	804000	Is it a half hour or is it...
804000	805000	So that was all live action.
805000	807000	Yeah, it's all live action, but we...
807000	809000	Then you go back and flash animate it.
809000	812000	Yeah, everything is done and it's reverse flash with live action.
812000	814000	Everything is comped in.
814000	815000	They do it like a thing where they...
815000	816000	It's all composite shots.
816000	817000	Right.
817000	820000	It's like Drunk History meets...
820000	821000	Caroline Goes to the City.
821000	822000	Caroline Goes to the City.
822000	823000	Yeah.
823000	824000	It's Drunk History meets Caroline Goes to the City,
824000	828000	except this time we're taking the drawings that Caroline made you never saw
828000	830000	and we're showing them.
830000	833000	And Caroline Goes to the City is like Young Sheldon
833000	835000	to Caroline in the City, right?
835000	838000	It's about her getting there, like driving there.
838000	839000	Yeah, it's before she got there.
839000	841000	What's the angle on Young Sheldon?
841000	844000	Give me the log line, the elevator pitch on Young Sheldon.
844000	846000	I think the title is the elevator pitch.
846000	847000	It's like he's...
847000	849000	It's a single camera Chuck Lorre show, right?
849000	850000	That's the real pitch.
850000	852000	Oh, it's a single camera, huh?
852000	853000	I think so, right?
853000	854000	Wow, I didn't know that.
854000	855000	I'm interested.
855000	856000	You really get intimate.
856000	858000	You know, I met him once and he did say,
859000	860000	because I said...
860000	862000	You met Young Sheldon or you met Chuck Lorre?
862000	863000	They're the same person.
863000	866000	I met Chuck Lorre at some thing.
866000	867000	Oh, I think I met him.
867000	869000	I think I met him at...
869000	870000	Caroline's.
870000	875000	At that thing that Eric Eitel did, the Dick show.
875000	877000	I think he was there.
877000	879000	All about Dick.
879000	880000	Yeah.
880000	882000	Anyways, I was like, oh, that's Chuck Lorre.
882000	884000	Yeah, we met at the after party there.
885000	888000	And then I asked him,
888000	890000	like, is there something you...
890000	892000	What is it that you want?
892000	893000	What is it?
893000	894000	Right.
894000	895000	What do you want?
895000	896000	What do you want?
896000	897000	Why'd you get out of bed today?
897000	900000	But the way you said it was, what the fuck, dude?
900000	901000	What did he say?
901000	905000	He said, well, actually, I want what you have.
905000	907000	I'd love to do a single camera show.
907000	910000	That's, you know, that's it.
910000	911000	I was waiting for him to say,
911000	914000	that is a critical darling and it's very well crafted,
914000	916000	but he really just was talking about medium.
916000	918000	I'd like to do what you do.
918000	920000	I'd like to just work less cameras.
920000	923000	Yeah, just less cameras and have more time to edit.
923000	925000	That does sound nice.
925000	928000	Nobody wants to do single cameras if you can do a multi-camera thing.
928000	929000	The hours are way better.
929000	930000	It's cheaper.
930000	932000	I think, yeah, but I guess if you, I mean,
932000	935000	well, I would imply maybe he has a creative ambition
935000	939000	that's not being, maybe that's all that's left
939000	943000	once you've conquered the medium, you know, you go like, okay,
943000	946000	but what would I, what can't I do?
946000	947000	I'm going to do that.
947000	948000	Yeah, man.
948000	949000	I guess.
949000	950000	I would retire.
950000	951000	I would start pole vaulting.
951000	952000	Yeah.
952000	954000	I wouldn't, I would not do it.
954000	956000	I'm not going to, I did think for a little bit,
956000	958000	like maybe I'll do multi-cam, but then I tried it,
958000	964000	I sucked at it and I wasn't like, oh, that means it's important to do.
964000	967000	I was like, I'll do it again.
967000	971000	No, I can't watch it or make it.
971000	976000	Now I have to figure out a different way to get the fuck out of this business.
976000	978000	What about supplements?
978000	982000	I don't think those earn you money.
982000	986000	Although if you go to forhims.com, you can get supplements.
986000	992000	You can help us make money by putting in the code erection.
992000	995000	We could prevent you from going bald.
996000	999000	And that'll make you money because the world loves hair.
999000	1000000	Yeah.
1000000	1003000	And they're willing to pay for it in India.
1003000	1006000	Don't we get it from there?
1006000	1007000	It goes both ways.
1007000	1008000	Oh, we get it from, if we get it from India.
1008000	1009000	Yeah, we get it from there.
1009000	1010000	You're right.
1010000	1012000	We're going bald and they're giving us their hair.
1012000	1015000	They've got hair and hair like hair.
1015000	1020000	Well, what's been new, Pemperton, anything?
1020000	1021000	I don't know, man.
1021000	1024000	Just been moving through physical space on a daily basis.
1024000	1025000	What did you think about that royal wedding?
1025000	1027000	I know that you're a big royal watcher.
1027000	1028000	Yeah, I did.
1028000	1032000	I had a fun time looking at the front page of CNN because sometimes I look at CNN just
1032000	1035000	as a default, like as a time waster kind of.
1035000	1038000	Like I just click CNN to look at it.
1038000	1042000	And the entire front page of CNN was royal wedding news.
1042000	1047000	The entire page, even above the full, was all nothing but CNN, nothing but royal wedding.
1047000	1048000	It is a big deal.
1048000	1051000	Doesn't it feel you're maybe you're too young for this, but it's like I was like probably
1051000	1055000	I was tenish or something like that when the Princess Die thing was happening.
1055000	1056000	I was live for that.
1056000	1058000	Not her dying, but her getting married.
1058000	1062000	Like it was a royal wedding that everyone really cared about because she was that was
1062000	1067000	the 80s version of being black was that she was just like from fucking Chutney or something.
1067000	1069000	People think they used to do that.
1069000	1070000	She was from Worwitcher.
1070000	1072000	She was from Chutney.
1072000	1074000	She was from Stoke-on-Trent.
1074000	1076000	That was unacceptable back then.
1076000	1078000	She was from Elephant and Castle, which is my favorite place.
1078000	1080000	I think that's where Michael Caine is from.
1080000	1086000	It's called Elephant and Castle because it was originally called the, some Spanish princess
1086000	1091000	was banging one of the royals and she was the Infante de Castillo.
1091000	1097000	Like the child of Castillo or Castilla and nobody that lived there wanted to say like
1097000	1100000	we're not calling it fucking Infante de Castillo.
1100000	1102000	Elephant and Castle.
1102000	1105000	They're like we're not calling it fucking Infante.
1105000	1107000	We're not speaking Spanish under any circumstances.
1107000	1108000	That's smart.
1108000	1111000	There's a place called Blubber Houses in Britain.
1111000	1112000	Blubber Houses?
1112000	1113000	Blubber.
1113000	1114000	How are the Brits?
1114000	1115000	I'm sure the answer is bad.
1115000	1116000	I mean, whatever.
1116000	1117000	Is it bad?
1117000	1118000	I hear they're Brexit-ing.
1118000	1119000	Have you heard of them?
1119000	1120000	They're Brexit-ing.
1120000	1121000	Have you heard of them?
1121000	1122000	Have you heard of them?
1122000	1123000	Double Brexit-ing.
1123000	1127000	Oh, now there's a boy racial princess saying, oh yeah, I got it.
1127000	1128000	Double Brexit.
1128000	1129000	Yeah.
1129000	1135000	That makes me want to frame Roger Rabbit.
1135000	1136000	But you're supposed to be helping him.
1136000	1137000	Boy, I know.
1137000	1138000	That's why I'm so bloody mad.
1138000	1142000	The double Brexit is when you poop on an Englishman's chest, right?
1142000	1143000	Yeah.
1143000	1144000	Yeah.
1144000	1147000	But yeah, I don't know anything about her.
1147000	1149000	I heard like a rumor.
1149000	1150000	She was on Suits.
1150000	1153000	She was a coworker of Jeff.
1153000	1155000	I was on a show that she was in.
1155000	1156000	It's crazy that she's American.
1156000	1157000	Yeah.
1157000	1161000	I mean, it's almost like it's being kind of overshadowed by the fact that she's, because
1161000	1163000	the people keep saying biracial, she's biracial.
1163000	1165000	It's like, well, fuck that.
1165000	1166000	She's from America.
1166000	1168000	I heard she was also outspoken.
1168000	1169000	Yeah.
1169000	1170000	Probably.
1170000	1171000	I heard she's outspoken.
1171000	1174000	I heard she doesn't go there.
1174000	1175000	Really?
1175000	1176000	No, she did.
1176000	1177000	Are you sure?
1177000	1181000	Well, she'll go there, but she'll make sure that...
1181000	1183000	Well, she doesn't play that.
1183000	1184000	She doesn't play that.
1184000	1186000	She will certainly not play that.
1186000	1187000	No.
1187000	1188000	But she will go there.
1188000	1189000	She won't do that.
1189000	1191000	I mean, she may do that.
1191000	1193000	I couldn't say.
1194000	1196000	I can't understand getting excited about royalty.
1196000	1199000	However, I guess the one thing to get excited about it would be...
1199000	1201000	I guess it's like NASCAR.
1201000	1205000	You could say, well, you're watching all you want, but you're waiting for someone to
1205000	1206000	die, right?
1206000	1208000	Otherwise, you're saying you like to watch cars driving a circle.
1208000	1211000	So you're watching the royal...
1211000	1215000	We get royal fever when there's a wreck, when there's something that's happening.
1215000	1217000	Like, who was the Fergie lady?
1217000	1219000	What, did she sleep with a plumber or something?
1219000	1221000	She did Coke, too.
1221000	1222000	The royals.
1222000	1227000	The royals were so into the royals because it's being turbulized.
1227000	1229000	What was the king that slept with Wawel Simpson?
1229000	1230000	That was a big thing.
1230000	1232000	He had to abdicate the throne and whatnot.
1232000	1234000	And they lived in a boat.
1234000	1236000	They're not really allowed to do anything, right?
1236000	1240000	Like, you can go visit their hat under plexiglass.
1240000	1243000	I went to London and I...
1243000	1246000	The line to see their fucking hat...
1246000	1247000	They call it a crown.
1247000	1249000	I'm American.
1249000	1250000	I'm American.
1250000	1251000	It's a hat.
1251000	1254000	And the line was longer than the Indiana Jones ride.
1254000	1256000	Unacceptable.
1256000	1258000	Did you see him?
1258000	1261000	Yeah, I walked up and it was like...
1261000	1264000	It was a hat under glass with like...
1264000	1267000	I can't tell the difference between real jewels and like...
1267000	1268000	They're not the real jewels.
1268000	1269000	The real jewels, they keep getting took.
1269000	1270000	So now they have...
1270000	1273000	You go up and you want to see the Kohinoor, the mountain of light.
1273000	1275000	Speaking of Indian things that we stole.
1275000	1277000	And you go there, it's not even the fucking real flim flam
1277000	1280000	because that keeps getting taken.
1280000	1283000	So you stand in line and go look at the crown jewels
1283000	1284000	and you're looking at a bunch of bullshit.
1284000	1288000	And since the world is ending and there's no reward for being cultured anymore,
1288000	1293000	can we just say, as Americans, can we even access...
1293000	1296000	I was touring that place, that castle, whatever you call it,
1296000	1299000	the English castle.
1299000	1301000	And they're just like...
1301000	1305000	To your left is the bloody tower.
1305000	1310000	It's said that Queen Boleyn every night always scratches her arse
1310000	1315000	because in 1216 an affair with the Duke of Kensington
1315000	1318000	caused quite a stir in their bodies.
1318000	1322000	This shit happened like so long ago that it's not even...
1322000	1324000	They didn't even have paper.
1324000	1326000	You're just saying some shit.
1326000	1327000	It's ghost stories.
1327000	1329000	They used to call hats crowns.
1329000	1332000	It's just kind of like, I can't access that stuff.
1333000	1338000	I don't know what anything older than 200 years could possibly be like
1338000	1341000	because if we valued that stuff in America,
1341000	1344000	then we'd have to cop to slavery.
1344000	1351000	All of our awesome ancient history is about slavery or genocide.
1351000	1357000	We owe it to ourselves and each other to be always looking forward in this country.
1357000	1360000	I just had a tour of the south with the Who's Live guys.
1360000	1365000	Not a lot of upbeat southern tourist attractions.
1365000	1368000	Unless you're talking about blues museums or like...
1368000	1369000	Alligators.
1369000	1370000	Alligator museums.
1370000	1372000	What was Downbeat?
1374000	1378000	The Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.
1378000	1381000	Because aside from Bobby Jones and Margaret Mitchell,
1381000	1383000	who...
1383000	1385000	What's the slavery movie?
1385000	1387000	Gone With the Wind.
1387000	1389000	The slavery movie?
1389000	1391000	She makes it romantic.
1391000	1394000	No, there's just a thousand dead Confederate soldiers
1394000	1397000	and a lot of them, you know, have my name.
1397000	1399000	That's pretty rough.
1399000	1400000	Yeah.
1400000	1402000	I can't tour anything.
1402000	1405000	I went to the Anne Frank house.
1405000	1407000	That's a kick in the pants.
1407000	1408000	Is it?
1408000	1409000	It's a lot of laughs.
1409000	1410000	I was there.
1410000	1411000	Oh, I see what you're saying.
1411000	1413000	Yeah, but it's like the furniture's all gone.
1413000	1414000	What?
1414000	1415000	You go...
1415000	1417000	See, I would have only gone.
1417000	1419000	You go up these steep stairs and then there's like...
1419000	1422000	There's shit printed out on Wikipedia
1422000	1426000	and taped to the walls that you can read as you move through the...
1426000	1428000	It's just taped to the walls?
1428000	1429000	Yeah.
1429000	1430000	That seems like pretty low...
1430000	1431000	Pretty like...
1431000	1432000	Yeah.
1432000	1433000	That's not good.
1433000	1434000	Yeah.
1434000	1435000	Where did they go?
1435000	1436000	It's so cheap.
1436000	1437000	Where was that?
1437000	1438000	Philadelphia?
1438000	1439000	Boston.
1439000	1441000	Yeah, that's kind of cool, because they have...
1441000	1443000	Oh, that's what a fireplace looked like in polar fear.
1443000	1444000	It was tiny?
1444000	1445000	Like this big?
1445000	1448000	It was low and it looked like a hobbit might be hanging out there.
1448000	1449000	It all looked very Tolkien-esque.
1449000	1451000	That was the one thing that I found.
1451000	1452000	That was the one tour.
1452000	1455000	We went to Al Capone's hideout somewhere in northern Wisconsin, me and my family.
1455000	1458000	And I was like, oh, all the hallways were tiny.
1458000	1463000	I always thought that museums, when they showed the recreations of the places
1463000	1465000	and museums, that they were just saving money.
1465000	1469000	Like they were making it like 0.8 scale or something to use less lumber.
1469000	1471000	But I guess people, they didn't have vitamins.
1471000	1472000	They were mini.
1472000	1473000	So they were just like little hobbits back then.
1473000	1474000	It was like 5'2".
1474000	1479000	Al Capone, he just looked big compared to all the other little tiny people.
1479000	1483000	And their planes were small and their beer bottles were small.
1483000	1484000	We do...
1484000	1487000	When I go out and do comedy shows, we play in a lot of old theaters
1487000	1489000	and they're all built by tiny people.
1489000	1491000	You bump your head on everything. It's crazy.
1491000	1493000	Spencer, you know things.
1493000	1496000	Is there a name for a disorder where I can't hold a brand new pen
1496000	1498000	without breaking off the clip?
1498000	1501000	Like the lapel clip or whatever you call it.
1502000	1504000	Lack of object permanence.
1504000	1507000	I just, I can't, I break them immediately.
1507000	1510000	Why don't you get the pens without those things on them?
1510000	1512000	Then what am I going to break?
1512000	1516000	So it is weird, I feel like there's a lot of American culture
1516000	1519000	that's wrapped up in like ahistorical-ness or whatever,
1519000	1523000	like an intentional misreading or misunderstanding of history.
1523000	1525000	It's really weird, I mean, I don't know.
1525000	1528000	It's just like, because America started in 1776,
1529000	1531000	it's like we've been, we've barely been around
1531000	1535000	and most of that time, like, civil rights haven't existed.
1535000	1539000	But we go like, oh yeah, it was so long ago this stuff happened.
1539000	1542000	It's like, no, it happened when my mom was alive.
1542000	1545000	Like there was a before and after. It's like really crazy.
1545000	1547000	Yeah, we don't like dealing with that shit.
1547000	1550000	But like, I just was listening to a podcast that's like about lore
1550000	1551000	and it talked about the golem.
1551000	1552000	You know the golem?
1552000	1556000	Like this mythical golem, like a homunculus or a chimera.
1556000	1560000	The golem legend only goes back to like late 1700s.
1560000	1562000	What was the city that the golem was supposed to be in?
1562000	1565000	I think it was in some Spanish city or maybe...
1565000	1566000	It was like a giant?
1566000	1573000	It was a clay monster made by Jewish people to protect the city.
1573000	1576000	Yeah, or not the city, the people,
1576000	1578000	because apparently it was a huge thing back then
1578000	1583000	to pretend that Jewish people were behind blood sacrifices.
1583000	1586000	And so you'd kill a body, you'd kill a child and then hide it
1586000	1588000	in someone's, like a Jewish person's basement
1588000	1590000	and call the police and go like,
1590000	1593000	I think this Jewish person just sucked all the blood out of this child.
1593000	1596000	And then they'd go and they'd be like, well clearly this happened.
1596000	1603000	And if they could go like, we were all over here in Shul
1603000	1607000	and we have like, we have a thousand witnesses in a tight-knit community
1607000	1609000	and we're peaceful people and then we go like,
1609000	1611000	well you probably used one of them golems.
1611000	1612000	No, it was the other way.
1612000	1616000	So they're like, the golems were to like tell people not to like...
1616000	1617000	Don't hide a body here.
1617000	1618000	Well, yeah.
1618000	1620000	He like, please don't hide a body here.
1620000	1622000	He put the body back where it came from.
1622000	1623000	He put the body back?
1623000	1624000	Was that really with the golem?
1624000	1625000	Did he put the body back?
1625000	1627000	He did one of the things he did, yeah.
1627000	1631000	It's like throwing a tear gas canister back at the cops.
1631000	1632000	Yeah.
1632000	1634000	But the second he touches that body, he becomes an accessory.
1634000	1636000	The golem made a clay, he can just dissolve.
1636000	1637000	Yeah, he's a golem.
1637000	1638000	He just turns back in his clay.
1638000	1640000	That's what the priest said.
1640000	1641000	It was the golem, the golem did it.
1641000	1643000	What about state lines though?
1643000	1644000	I don't know how that works in New York.
1644000	1646000	The golems were made out of state lines.
1646000	1647000	Made out of state lines?
1647000	1652000	So they cross themselves and they become a federal crime just by existing?
1652000	1653000	Yeah.
1653000	1655000	Remember how important the county line was in Dukes of Hazzard?
1655000	1657000	They'd just drive up and down that road and then it was like,
1657000	1659000	it's like every time it happened for the first time,
1659000	1662000	it'd be like, yeah, them Duke boys across the county line!
1662000	1663000	Go, go, go!
1663000	1665000	Yeah, because Roscoe P. Coltrane would lose all jurisdiction.
1665000	1666000	Yeah, he can't.
1666000	1667000	I can't.
1667000	1669000	His name was Roscoe P. Coltrane?
1669000	1670000	Roscoe P. Coltrane.
1670000	1671000	Roscoe P. Coltrane.
1671000	1672000	No, it wasn't.
1672000	1673000	It was in Chickasaw County, right?
1673000	1674000	It was in Chickasaw County.
1674000	1677000	They would go into the other county and then all hell broke loose.
1677000	1679000	Well, I thought you forgot the name of Hazzard County.
1679000	1680000	His name was...
1680000	1681000	Roscoe...
1681000	1683000	But they were crossing the Chickasaw County, didn't they?
1683000	1686000	I don't know, Chickabay, Tain the Wayne.
1686000	1689000	Roscoe P. Coltrane was the name of the show.
1689000	1692000	And J.D. Ha... it was Jefferson Davis Hogg.
1692000	1697000	So if you don't think I got teased in elementary school.
1698000	1704000	So I went to the Turner up fronts because I'm part of the Turner family.
1704000	1709000	And it was really funny because I was there a couple years ago.
1709000	1712000	I was there for the one that was before the elections.
1712000	1721000	And I remember at that one, because I remember we had Allie and Shawkat on shortly after that.
1721000	1724000	And we had both just seen each other in New York, which is why she was on the show.
1724000	1728000	And we were at the Turner up fronts and we were talking about how weird it was,
1728000	1732000	how much they were selling that the election was going to be a squeaker.
1732000	1736000	Which made it extra funny this year because they were like...
1736000	1739000	Wolf Blitzer couldn't be found in the building.
1739000	1745000	Last time he was front and center and was promising these sponsors.
1745000	1750000	The barely unspoken but practically spoken message was,
1751000	1755000	Hey, Colgate, Nike, Heinz, whoever's here.
1755000	1759000	Don't be thinking that Hillary's got this in the bag.
1759000	1762000	This is going to be a fucking barn burner.
1762000	1763000	That's what a squeaker means?
1763000	1764000	Yeah.
1764000	1768000	They kept using that phrase and all of our research shows it's going to be a squeaker
1768000	1773000	because they're selling a television show called The News that hasn't happened yet.
1773000	1774000	A squeaker is when it's close?
1774000	1775000	Yeah, very close.
1775000	1777000	Almost too close to tell.
1777000	1782000	So then this year they come out, I missed a year probably,
1782000	1788000	but then they come out and it's like, they barely mentioned CNN
1788000	1793000	except towards the end and then they run this thing that's like this poetry piece
1793000	1799000	that's about what if everyone started calling apples bananas
1799000	1804000	and then there's one girl who knows an apple is an apple or something like that.
1804000	1806000	But it's mostly just like visual stuff.
1806000	1810000	And then there's like an understated like title that says like,
1810000	1813000	the truth is more important than ever right now.
1813000	1815000	I was like, yeah, I wonder why?
1815000	1817000	How'd that happen?
1817000	1820000	Who created that fucking marketplace?
1820000	1821000	Yeah.
1821000	1823000	The truth is pretty valuable right now.
1823000	1826000	Like it's crazy how foggy it got there for a while.
1826000	1829000	Remember the squeaker you cocks?
1829000	1832000	It's crazy how they keep paying people to come on their own channel
1832000	1835000	and say, these are oranges, these are oranges, these are oranges.
1835000	1836000	Give me money.
1836000	1837000	Yeah.
1837000	1839000	The company saying it's not, they're not supposed to say that.
1839000	1844000	Please, please pay us $500,000 for 30 seconds during Kellyanne Conway
1844000	1850000	like spitting saliva into the camera and saying that the president's dick is big
1850000	1852000	so that Anderson Cooper can roll his eyes at it
1852000	1855000	because the truth is more important than ever right now.
1855000	1857000	He has a big dick?
1857000	1859000	It's pretty big.
1859000	1861000	Okay. I hadn't watched it in a while.
1861000	1862000	I'm not sure.
1862000	1863000	That's canon.
1863000	1864000	That's canon on the news.
1864000	1865000	It's really wide.
1865000	1866000	It's super wide.
1866000	1867000	It's not very long.
1867000	1868000	So it's wider than his lawn?
1868000	1870000	In high school they called him trashcan lid.
1870000	1871000	Trashcan lid.
1871000	1875000	Because his dick is like 14 inches wide but it's only like about two inches long.
1875000	1880000	Like you can't, like he can please like 11 school kids by spinning it.
1880000	1882000	Like they, and it's not even against the law
1882000	1886000	because it's technically zonable as playground equipment.
1886000	1888000	Oh, it's one of those little things you sit on.
1888000	1889000	It's called sin spin, right?
1889000	1890000	It's called sin spin.
1890000	1894000	Don't let that, I mean that's been co-opted by the porn industry as being like, you know, different.
1894000	1895000	I thought it was a spinner.
1895000	1896000	That's a squeaker.
1896000	1897000	Right in spinner.
1897000	1898000	A squeaker and a spinner.
1898000	1899000	That's the same.
1899000	1900000	It's going to be a spinner.
1900000	1901000	It's a squeak and spin.
1901000	1902000	A snapper.
1902000	1903000	A squeak.
1903000	1904000	It's red snapper, squeak and spin.
1904000	1905000	All the way until the end.
1905000	1906000	Red snapper, squeak and spin.
1906000	1908000	That's just a great fish.
1908000	1909000	Yeah.
1909000	1915000	I got a huge dent in my head where that, where I hit my head in New York and like.
1915000	1916000	I thought that was a shingles.
1916000	1917000	Yes, you don't.
1917000	1918000	No, it wasn't shingles.
1918000	1919000	It was a wound.
1919000	1920000	And then the.
1920000	1921000	Still there?
1921000	1922000	And then the.
1922000	1923000	I hate the.
1923000	1924000	I don't.
1924000	1928000	I'm not a big fan of using the word scab, but like I got a.
1928000	1929000	Union strong.
1929000	1930000	The scab.
1930000	1931000	The scab.
1931000	1935440	Because I, different people are squeamish about different stuff and to me scabs are
1935440	1936440	kind of gross.
1936440	1940000	People talk about them a lot, but there's no way around at this time.
1940000	1943720	I had a big scab on my head and it came away.
1943720	1944720	But the.
1944720	1945720	What do you mean it came away?
1945720	1946720	Even though there wasn't a.
1946720	1947720	I'm trying.
1947720	1952400	I'm trying not to say the gross words for like a scab coming off.
1952400	1953400	It sloughed off.
1953400	1957160	But it's like, it's like, it's if the scab was like, like, even though when I got the
1957160	1962080	head wound, it wasn't, it didn't, it wasn't actively bleeding, but then it turned into
1962080	1964040	this big scab.
1964040	1969360	And then when the scab came away, there's a divot now where the scab was.
1969360	1974480	It's like where the scab, the scab was like, can I like heal my head, but then just collapsed
1974480	1979680	my scalp, like, like where the wound was and started working on knitting the flesh
1979680	1980680	back up.
1980680	1983040	And then I maybe I picked the scab too much and then they're like, fuck it.
1983040	1984040	You want to fucking.
1984040	1985960	There's no flush up there, though, to move.
1985960	1986960	Right.
1986960	1987960	It has to go from the bottom up.
1987960	1988960	That's what I'm saying.
1988960	1992560	Like if you felt my head right now, you'd think there was bone damage because there's
1992560	1993560	nothing up there but skull.
1993560	1994560	I do.
1994560	1995560	I was feeling my head.
1995560	1996560	Can we take turns?
1996560	1997560	I'm thinking I feel it.
1997560	1998560	It might be more gallons disease.
1998560	1999560	Yeah.
1999560	2000560	Mark Ellen's disease.
2000560	2001560	More gallons disease.
2001560	2002560	More gallons?
2002560	2003560	That's a curse.
2003640	2004640	More gallon?
2004640	2005640	More.
2005640	2006640	M-O-R-G-E-L-L-O-N-S.
2006640	2008440	I thought it was more gallons.
2008440	2009440	Is it more gallons?
2009440	2011560	I think if you have more gallons, you can say it however you want.
2011560	2012560	It's for like gangstalking.
2012560	2013560	Gangstalking?
2013560	2018840	It's like, it's like gangstalking the disease, more gallons disease.
2018840	2019840	What is it?
2019840	2020840	What's gangstalking?
2020840	2024800	Gangstalking is when you think a bunch of people are stalking you all the time and you
2024800	2027560	go on coast to coast AM and talk about it every night.
2027560	2028560	Okay.
2028560	2029560	Yeah, you're right.
2029560	2033520	That's gangstalking and more gallons disease is when you think the aliens have put fiber
2033520	2037320	in your body and they're growing out of your skin, colorful fibers because you've been
2037320	2042080	experimented by the government and the gangstalks, they stalk you because the government is trying
2042080	2045800	to keep track of you so you don't report it to CNN or to coast to coast AM.
2045800	2046800	Oh.
2046800	2047800	Yeah.
2047800	2049880	I thought, if we talked about this, I don't know if we talked about this on this show
2049880	2053920	but I know Duncan was talking about this at one point where it's like the people, people
2053920	2058760	that now that we live in this world where we're, like there's people who are using the
2058760	2068280	woke language to defend basically what, 10 years ago, we all just recognized it's like
2068280	2073560	you need help, like in terms of like mental illness, like people are using phrases like
2073560	2081400	I identify as a person who has radio signals coming through his teeth fillings so you can't
2081400	2084720	tell me that I don't.
2084720	2086580	Like you can't call me crazy.
2086580	2087580	That's offensive.
2087580	2089380	My crazy is not your prom dress.
2089380	2093860	Which is very interesting because it's like, yep, you got us, you fucking got us.
2093860	2098100	I think that's, George Norris has been doing that forever though, I think it's great that
2098100	2099100	he does that.
2099100	2104900	I love that Art Bell would, Art Bell was like, he would just open the lines and go like,
2104900	2108420	I want to hear from time travelers, now I want to hear it.
2108420	2109860	You're the antichrist, call in.
2109860	2110860	Yeah.
2110860	2113560	And he always does stuff where he, when someone says something super crazy and you think he's
2113560	2118620	about to call him on it, he goes, what color was the spaceship, or he says nothing.
2118620	2119620	There's these guys.
2119620	2120620	What time was it?
2120620	2125160	There's a podcast called expanded perspectives, I think that's what it's called, and it's
2125160	2126660	two like Southern guys.
2126660	2134500	I picture them both as looking like Charlie Daniels or like, Johnny Paycheck, because they
2134500	2139900	talk like this and they're both, they're both, they're both fine Southern sounded gentlemen.
2139900	2145480	They razz each other about whether or not their wife has got them whipped or how they're
2145480	2150880	remodeling their kitchen and they're not, they're not all the way like, you know, they're not,
2150880	2157080	they're like into like Bigfoot and like a dog man and like, like all this weird shit.
2157080	2160160	And then like anybody who writes to them, they'll just read.
2160160	2165760	If you just write to them and say, the one guy going, all right, we got to get to some
2165760	2167320	of these letters.
2167320	2169000	Dear expanded perspectives.
2169020	2174180	I am a truck driver that was going down highway five and I have a story to tell you.
2174180	2175580	Oh boy, this sounds good.
2175580	2178420	Like they like vocalize on the symbol.
2178420	2186020	I was driving when suddenly my eyes picked up the side of a giant lizard man on the side
2186020	2187020	of the road.
2187020	2188020	What?
2188020	2189020	No.
2189020	2198180	Like they often like the guy like, and I was standing face to face with a human dinosaur
2198240	2199240	hybrid.
2199240	2200240	What?
2200240	2201240	Holy shit.
2201240	2203200	What episode was that?
2203200	2204200	It's all of them.
2204200	2206680	They, they, are they doing a bit or are they really yes and.
2206680	2209120	I think they're kind of, cause cause then I kept listening to it.
2209120	2213200	I was like, wait, did they just, did they just yes and everybody who writes in.
2213200	2216720	But then, then sometimes they're kind of inexplicably skeptical.
2216720	2220720	They're like, ah, well, I don't know if that really happened, but that's quite a story.
2220720	2222680	Maybe it's the writing style to get some sometimes.
2222680	2223680	Yeah.
2223680	2227800	Have you heard that a brainstorm versus a green needle shit?
2227800	2229100	I heard it.
2229100	2232900	Someone explained it to me too in a way that was like, ah, that's not fun.
2232900	2234220	Well here's another way.
2234220	2235220	That's not fun.
2235220	2241280	That like, you see that commercial though, the guys like stop the cash box and then it's
2241280	2243620	like, it's rock the cat box or something.
2243620	2246540	And it's like, yeah, they're doing rock the Casbah and they're all getting the lyrics
2246540	2247540	wrong.
2247540	2252100	It's like people have been hearing the wrong sounds forever.
2252100	2254460	I thought Michael Stipe had a list for 12 years.
2254460	2255460	Right.
2255460	2256460	Dan, do you know this thing?
2256460	2257460	Have you heard this?
2257460	2259760	I don't know if it works up to the phone here.
2259760	2261160	Are you talking about the Laurel Yanny?
2261160	2262160	Yeah.
2262160	2263160	It's like an extension.
2263160	2264160	But it's the same thing.
2264160	2265160	It's on a loop.
2265160	2272440	You either think in your head, yeah, the word brainstorm or think the word green needle.
2272440	2274520	Okay.
2274520	2277120	And there's one right answer.
2277120	2279120	Come on, go away.
2279120	2282360	I just don't like all these people trying to act like they hear Yanny.
2282360	2285400	You don't want to fucking hear Yanny.
2285400	2286400	Okay.
2286400	2291020	Well, that's I'm proud to say I hear neither.
2291020	2293180	That sounds like a laser.
2293180	2294340	I hear what I think, man.
2294340	2296460	I totally hear what I think you've not looking at.
2296460	2297460	That's crazy.
2297460	2300420	I just don't I don't think I think the acoustics aren't ideal for this.
2300420	2301420	That's the point.
2301420	2305180	That's part of it is that you just parse it because you're given incomplete information
2305180	2310380	and your brain puts a perception on it to give us broken up into like very low frequencies
2310380	2311380	and very high frequencies.
2311380	2314860	So when you pick one, you're telling your brain, I want to hear the high frequency,
2314860	2319280	which is green needles, a higher register sound than brainstorm.
2319280	2323760	I will say I watched a video clip, as most of us probably did, of a guy like using his
2323760	2328520	little sound app to like move the frequencies and demonstrate.
2328520	2333200	But he was only demonstrating for me that all I ever hear is Laurel.
2333200	2334200	Yeah.
2334200	2335200	Right.
2335200	2339040	Like he's like, look, bloop, bloop, bloop, yeah, look, let's round up these Yanny people
2339040	2344200	and fucking put an end to this because they're psychos phenomenon.
2344200	2349020	But isn't it probably like people hearing different I mean, but they're being weird.
2349020	2350080	They're not being right.
2350080	2353500	They're being aberrant like that might have bad phones, right?
2353500	2354540	But that's that's aberrant.
2354540	2356720	Like that's all not because that's the thing.
2356720	2358100	The fact is it did say Laurel.
2358100	2359780	The fact is that did say brainstorm.
2359780	2363740	It does in certain circumstances say sound green needle and that's and that's an accurate
2363740	2366900	perception, but it's an accurate aberrant perception of reality.
2366900	2367900	You know, that's the thing.
2367900	2372380	It's like what our brains are is simply making snap quick to say just like people simply
2372380	2373700	are wrong about stuff.
2373700	2376240	They're wrong about it being Yanny.
2376240	2380080	There's always been people that are convinced of something wrong.
2380080	2383400	Like we shouldn't pretend that they're right just because they feel like they're right.
2383400	2384480	No, they're wrong.
2384480	2385800	That blue dress, gold dress shit.
2385800	2386800	I never understood it.
2386800	2387800	Same thing.
2387800	2391720	This is just your monitor settings and how what your brightness is at.
2391720	2392720	It's the same thing.
2392720	2393720	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
2393720	2398240	It's not like a well, it's also is an empirical color of the actual dress in the world.
2398240	2401920	But the picture is subject to context.
2401920	2406780	I went to the most boring thing in Atlanta and I'm vegetarian and I wanted vegetarian
2406780	2412140	biscuits and gravy and they're like all of our gravy is vegetarian, but they don't kind
2412140	2413140	of want that out there.
2413140	2416700	Well, I would you can't make vegetarian, you can't make biscuits agree with that, but you
2416700	2417700	can't do that.
2417700	2418700	Yes, you can.
2418700	2419700	Well, listen up.
2419700	2422420	I'll say you can't do that, Mr. Jeff.
2422420	2428820	I saw a true crime show where the guy everything came down to what was in the guy's stomach
2428820	2434420	because if he if he if he had gone anywhere else since the restaurant where he supposedly
2434420	2440560	had breakfast, then I don't know, it's someone else killed him other than his ex-wife or
2440560	2441560	whatever.
2441560	2446520	But it became very important, like where he had eaten because he had onions in his stomach
2446520	2451660	and he was like he always orders that the hash browns with no onions and we don't put
2451660	2456800	hash browns in our onions at the diner and and like the case goes cold and like because
2456800	2461140	because it doesn't say onions on the menu and the hash browns and the guy said, I've
2461140	2462260	been working here 10 years.
2462260	2465460	I've never put onions in the hash browns and then and then the whole thing gets resolved
2465460	2469420	and what the cop is like, you know what, I'm just going to go over there and watch him
2469420	2470420	make the hash browns.
2470420	2472860	So this is like a regular kitchen at a diner.
2472860	2475380	The guy is like mixing all the fucking food together.
2475380	2476620	There's onions everywhere.
2476620	2478420	There's onions on the fucking spatula.
2478420	2479420	Yeah.
2479420	2480940	So there was an onion in his stomach 10 years.
2480940	2482780	The fucking forensic files.
2482780	2484100	I don't know what it was.
2484100	2491080	All I know is that justice is is not it's it's doesn't it's it's not helping.
2491080	2494000	Well it's blind in a bad way it turns out.
2494000	2497080	The bad guys the bad guys get away with a lot.
2497080	2502520	And yet I know that if I tried to commit a crime tomorrow, the same for the same reason
2502520	2504560	that I never would, I would fail.
2504560	2506320	I would get caught immediately.
2506320	2507960	That's all about dog hair.
2507960	2511080	That should be a thing.
2511080	2512080	These days.
2512080	2517100	But that's the thing is that I have dog hair over all over me all the time.
2517100	2519180	I constantly have covered in dog hair.
2519180	2520700	You have a test your dog.
2520700	2521700	Okay.
2521700	2522700	And I don't know.
2522700	2523700	Most people have dog.
2523700	2528620	A lot of people have dogs or a cat and that seems to be like never factors in like if
2528620	2529620	you're covered.
2529620	2530620	I can't get away.
2530620	2531620	I can't get away.
2531620	2532620	You're trying.
2532620	2535300	You're wondering why you're getting it worse than than how come everybody doesn't always
2535300	2536500	have dog hair all over them.
2536500	2540780	How come like people aren't constantly caught doing things right in forensic files or cole
2540780	2544800	K shows because well this is clearly your dog's hair on you.
2544800	2545800	Yeah.
2545800	2548840	There's this orange dog hair found on the scene of crime and you have this orange dog
2548840	2549840	or whatever.
2549840	2550840	Not even even the color.
2550840	2552600	I don't know if they do DNA for dogs.
2552600	2557360	Like forensic files it's always like and then he stepped on a hamburger bun after using
2557360	2561040	his bare feet because he didn't want to get these people almost get away with it all the
2561040	2562040	time.
2562040	2563040	Like they're the craziest people.
2563040	2567840	They're like well I really want to like sexually assault this person but I didn't bring any
2567840	2568840	gloves.
2568840	2570780	I put my shoe on my head and use it as a hat.
2570780	2575100	It's like they almost get away with it but then they like slip on a hamburger bun and
2575100	2579660	then like a hamburger bun expert spends six million dollars like reconstructing his toe
2579660	2586380	with an anthropologist or something like like those guys almost get away with it which means
2586380	2588020	a bunch of them do.
2588020	2591740	These are forensic files are about the unlucky criminals.
2591740	2598480	If I would never never commit a crime ever like like I would maybe commit the crime of
2598480	2603660	elitism and like like like hating the poor or something you know like an ethical crime
2603660	2608700	of like thinking I'm above other people and then I'm allowed to like maybe I maybe I would
2608700	2612440	like dress as a woman to escape the Titanic that kind of thing like I could see myself
2612440	2617960	like doing something incredibly cowardly like like like I if I was a soldier at war I could
2617960	2624540	see myself maybe like digging a tunnel and hiding deserting yeah like growing a potato
2624540	2629140	farm underneath the ground and waiting for the war to be over something like that like
2629140	2633540	a crime like crime like that you would have been an instant Nazi collaborator no that's
2633540	2638740	not just don't say that that's that's rolled over right up right off the bat no because
2638740	2643040	I do there's only and not because I'm a hero but because there's lines I got I just like
2643040	2647820	I wouldn't I would the lazier it's hard to be it's like I wouldn't I would be like fucking
2647820	2653940	kill me kill me fast I'm not gonna fucking live a life as a fucking background actor
2653940	2660660	and Schindler's List like like like like I was in Boy Scouts for six weeks and I was
2660660	2665620	like there's no bicycle rodeos here Charlie Brown lied in that commercial fucking that
2665620	2670180	was too fascist for me I can't fucking tow that line I am I'm saying you're a fascist
2670180	2673300	I'm saying that you they would they would have your number right off the bat yeah they
2673300	2677300	would kill me like I would be like just kill me you're Nazis and I'm never gonna I'll fuck
2677300	2681100	it all I have enough is do it I know but they're not gonna give me anything that I'm gonna
2681100	2685500	want they might flatter you and get you to work for them I can't imagine that happening
2685500	2689180	like give them something that they want they don't they don't need any oh you mean I might
2689180	2696820	turn in the Jews under my floorboards certainly I I'm not gonna sit here and say I wouldn't
2696820	2702140	do that because it's tacky to assign yourself that that like herodom you know I would do
2702140	2706620	that but I'd never do that but I'm not afraid to say it I'll tell you I mean that's why
2706620	2712980	I was experiencing so much stress after the election is because I do feel that in my heart
2712980	2719700	of hearts that push if push does come to that kind of shove some fucking like thing in me
2719700	2725260	is gonna take it to that place and I'm not gonna I'm gonna die for those people under
2725260	2730020	my floorboards because I'm because it won't be because I'm like a good person as much
2730020	2735100	as it'll be because I'm like like I'm just driven by anxiety and guilt and shame and
2735100	2740380	like I'll just like fucking take it all the way and I don't I don't want to do that so
2740380	2747620	please can we unelect this Nazi before shit gets dramatic but but I also recognize that
2747620	2754300	I can't say that I would have courage in the face of anything like that I'm a coward and
2754300	2762900	because I'm a coward like I think that I would rather die than allow a Nazi to have their
2762900	2768380	way like because I'm a chicken shit so I'd be like isn't that brave it's it's it's it's
2768380	2773220	nuanced I just think I'm so dedicated to cowardice that I'm like we can't have we can't have this
2773220	2776820	Nazi business going on you get it yeah I'm gonna have to poison you with my tea and then
2776820	2780340	I'm gonna blow my brains out thank you maybe if I could get close to Hitler I'm gonna eat
2780340	2786460	a grenade I think a lot of bravery is fear-based as well different people I think I think I
2786460	2790020	think bravery is like intelligence like there's different kinds of it I think there are some
2790020	2794980	people who are like well I would never ever ever do what you did and it's like this thing
2794980	2802660	that you consider dumb you know like like I mean you know a lot of people have stage fright as I
2802660	2807100	know it's a stupid example but I'm reading all these spy novels recently like John le Carré and
2807100	2812060	stuff and there's all this stuff that they call them like talent spotters or like they go out and
2812060	2817900	they like like oh I heard your podcast or I overheard you at the bar you're somebody that we
2817900	2826420	absolutely could use to be a mole or defect from your home country and work for us I'm in sure
2826420	2833700	I think I think I would have been a like a good kind of low-level spy well I'm glad to hear you
2833700	2837860	admitting that you would yeah they would come at you through your fashion sense they would be like
2837860	2844100	because you'd be like these Nazis they they got pretty uniforms like you they value a nice shoe
2844100	2849660	horn or whatever you people think about that might be how they got you they'd be like mr. Davis don't
2849660	2859460	you would do you not agree that these mud people have no sense I'm not gonna work for the Nazis
2859460	2865700	because they're well-dressed but the British or the Americans could have hired me to go infiltrate
2865700	2870780	the Nazis because I could I could pull up we obviously we would all opt to be a British spy
2870780	2876220	in the in the event to be a French spy personally but probably easier work right well you get to be
2876220	2886740	underground you know you get to hide mostly Yelp reviews undermining German restaurant I don't know
2886740	2898740	if I would call this William is stupid I know anything about it but but no but I'm sorry yeah
2898740	2905820	here's what you're saying Jeff because you're not conceited just convinced you're like oh in this
2905820	2910620	special episode like like you know they'll do an X-Files where it's like it's a black-and-white
2910620	2915300	episode and it's aboard the Titanic and there's Nazis and stuff like in this special episode of
2915300	2922620	our lives where there's a Nazi takeover like you're like oh I just ended up being a double
2922620	2930380	agent because I'd be really I'd be really suited to that task like yeah okay like it's got a nice
2930380	2934420	work if you can get it but like I most of us are gonna end up being that guy in the beginning of
2934420	2940780	Inglorious Bastards where it's like you have you have your daughters and your pile of firewood and
2940780	2946620	and a glass of milk and you got a fucking choice to make and what was the slip-up in that I forget
2946620	2952900	he just he caves he what do you mean what's the slip-up how did they find doesn't like the Jew
2952900	2959260	hunter whatever he calls himself is like it's it's it's establishing that this guy is so so he's so
2959260	2964740	intense that that he doesn't even need to do the shit from Schindler's List in order to get you to
2964940	2972740	like his Nazism is like so fuck it's like a fucking Darth Vader power that like like like this guy that
2972740	2980060	he just like insidiously and intimately like like weaves his brain into this guy and then it's just
2980060	2985020	like just just all you have to do is just just move your eyes differently and we'll take care of
2985020	2991300	everything and the guy did that yeah I think I must have just gone to the bathroom or something at
2991300	3000860	that part I miss the eye movement yeah they say when they are from my zero knowledge of spycraft
3000860	3006980	and all that jazz when they when they find timid people like like if there's a spy that knows
3006980	3013100	something people who work for Disney people who work for Disney are that way shy people who work
3013100	3017780	for Disney the company Disney they find timid people well yeah pretty much everyone if you ever
3017780	3023420	go to Disneyland everyone you'll talk to will be very nice but also very meek I think it's a thing
3023420	3029100	they actively seek out people who are like very like timid and meek and they make they make great
3029100	3035260	Disneyland employees I worked there for a while I guess you're right you did yeah but you're hard
3035260	3040940	Jeff huh you're hard I was too hard I couldn't I couldn't fucking do it yeah I mean they had a cowboy
3040940	3045100	show so they hired you for a little bit cuz they're like we need a fucking swinging dick but but
3045100	3054100	when fuck I don't know late 90s what did you do there when they were getting rid of the electric of
3054100	3059660	the Main Street electric parade they brought it back yeah because the second one sucked they
3059660	3066540	the solar parade I mean come on yeah I mean what it was a what is a parade without a little bit of a
3066540	3073540	footprint you can't stand there and just photosynthesize that's not a parade
3073540	3078740	I did the improv and stuff on the parade route and then did you do milk bubble throw these sketches
3078740	3084300	that were on Frontierland for like a decade I was there for like two years I called them on his
3084300	3090260	bubble throat I actually fucking roasted I have polyp throat I have a I have a I actually have a
3090260	3094380	bubble in my throat all right that was different you had that and then it stopped then you know
3094380	3099180	what back to pull up it was it's I have a polyp on my vocal fold I agree it's pretty gross
3099940	3104420	photo of it you're still talking and stuff I can talk but it you're not supposed to I can feel like
3104420	3112180	I'm a marble in me yeah you get removed you don't want to surgery on that is very very dangerous
3112180	3116260	because if you if it scars then you never talk or sing again I'll tell you who I'm not gonna be
3116260	3120540	this fucking March violets that you told me about like you could see shades of that happening with
3120540	3126580	the that when Kanye lost his grip a little bit and then but it wasn't him that was disturbing
3126580	3135700	cuz he's Kanye he it was it was it was his wife the Mrs. Kardashian who as she was defending her
3135700	3142860	husband rather gallantly like she part of her defense of him was like a little thematically
3142860	3151060	arranged around this idea that like this is I'm paraphrasing but I got the message from her that
3151060	3156020	like you know a year from now you're all gonna be into this you know it was like I was like that's
3156020	3162660	exactly what we're bummed out it's like like like yeah no shit like it's called fucking March
3162660	3168860	wow it's called a fucking coup like I yeah that's why we don't we're not enjoying it can we have your
3168860	3174500	permission to not enjoy it like like it's not all like like the fucking cerulean blue yeah it's
3174500	3180300	gonna come down like our version of March violence would be like like like you know that is you
3180300	3185620	seeing violence or violence violence like a flower okay it's like it's a late blooming flower and it
3185620	3193820	was called Nazis that joined the party later people who tweeted all about get this fucking guy out of
3193820	3200300	here they were given a little bit of a amnesty especially the rich people a coveted thing was
3200300	3206340	a very low like early Nazi party number and if you were like had a really long like late later
3206340	3212220	day number you joined in the 40s took you long enough how many fucking camps did we have to build
3212220	3217460	before you realized that it was then people would die and there was a lot of like like black market
3217460	3221500	trading is like can I get your like let's kill this guy I'm gonna take his party number so it'll
3221500	3227400	look like I joined in 1938 and not 1944 absolutely said that's exactly what's gonna happen like it's
3227400	3232420	gonna except it's gonna be like services that wipe out your Twitter feed it's gonna be like it's
3232420	3236380	gonna be like the serial number on your on your MAGA hat like I got this MAGA hat well the Don I
3236380	3243900	was in 2014 was that when she when Kim Kardashian was was defending Kanye which I want to be
3243900	3250100	sympathetic to her because obviously I think I mean like I like humanity I think if you love your
3250100	3254740	husband and blah blah blah like I know there's a lot of there's a lot of well-intended controversy
3254740	3258980	about the stuff because it comes down to the issues that I find actually appealingly human
3258980	3262900	because there are some people who are like oh it's mental health issues and all this stuff like
3262900	3267860	it's good let's all have that conversation let's all go round and round but so I'm not bagging on
3267860	3275540	anybody for like for shouting at a throng of peasants you know stop judging my husband that's
3275540	3282780	just bad that's just an expression of love okay I'm not judging anybody for that and nor is it like
3282780	3288500	I'm just saying that while she was doing that there were a couple things that she said that
3288900	3294420	kind of just like like part of her defense of him was like you know he's always been ahead of the
3294420	3299860	curve you know that you it's just like like like people always make fun of him for it you know it
3299860	3303940	wasn't it was it wasn't all the way that but it was like there was just this enough of a taste of it
3303940	3309620	that it was just like uh that's exactly that's exactly what you're what I'm afraid you're right
3309620	3314180	about she might be right she might be of course she might be I mean this is the thing you can't
3314180	3321140	trust rich fucking people to lead the charge against a fascist coup they're gonna fucking
3321140	3327540	flip as soon as the front stops holding they're gonna be like okay how do I keep my house yeah
3327540	3334340	I love I love his line where he said uh poopity scoopity poopity scoopity yeah when he said that
3334340	3341140	poopity scoopity that was a dog you know what he makes a good point I hadn't considered that angle
3341140	3344740	what he's trying to say is you should when you see poop you should joyfully pick it up
3345780	3349620	you should poopity scoopity you shouldn't be like this is something that he said in a song
3349620	3353700	all right he's late a single the court this is why I think the whole Kanye thing
3354420	3361220	I think it's all sort of a publicity smokescreen smoke screen that he's trying to obfuscate the
3361220	3365620	fact that he used poopity scoopity in a song I don't think that he gives a shit about Trump at
3365620	3370340	all well I really don't I I certainly will agree with you there I mean there's no there's absolutely
3370340	3376500	no question that he has not a single thought in his head about uh foreign policy right I mean he's
3376500	3381700	that yeah but but that's a little different from saying that he's fucking he does have a Jackman
3381700	3388820	in the prestige he has a beef with Obama and Obama Trump yeah and Trump is anti-obama because Obama
3388820	3396740	came out it was this Obama super west coast yeah he's like this old style Chicago though man
3397300	3402500	that's the third coast no but like Obama got caught on tape by like Buzzfeed or something
3402500	3408260	like calling Kanye a jackass and so like I think Kanye took it really personally being a jackass
3408260	3413300	and so he's like you know fuck you and then then he comes about saying like what did Obama do for
3413300	3418660	Chicago and that's just you know he's just trying to be a douche like and so Trump is saying the
3418660	3422820	same thing he's like yeah this is what I'm talking about we hate this guy in his defense if you're
3422820	3427460	ever going to take anything the president says personally it should be him calling you a jacket
3428420	3433380	you should take it so personally you change your life not you should be like the president
3433380	3439300	he's the one that's wrong but in Trump's defense black billionaire rapper employment is way up
3441140	3448020	um yeah uh anyways no the march violence thing that's what I was talking about just I just I just
3448020	3453620	pictured it was it was like it was like yeah like we're gonna get desensitized that concept
3453620	3459860	too it's like oh did you hear uh Bruce Willis like uh he fucking flipped and whatever it's
3459860	3467460	like yeah of course the the rich people are gonna flip before the people that are gonna die in pain
3467460	3470820	yeah it's like Kanye said like I don't think of America's racist if I thought America's racist
3470820	3475780	I'd move somewhere else which is easy to say if you can afford to pick up and go anywhere you
3476100	3479860	little Wayne said the same thing he like left the interview with Katie Couric years ago
3480740	3484500	saying the same thing he's basically like he basically said I'm a very wealthy man
3485140	3492100	and I wouldn't be wealthy if racism was that big a deal in America yeah and he uh says it in a way
3492100	3496820	he was like kind of calling out the black lives matter movement he doesn't really support it
3496820	3503140	because she asked him about that and um it's kind of a good plan I mean yeah like like I think Jeff's
3503140	3508660	point like it's like yeah but that there aren't that many jobs I mean yeah it's like it's like
3508660	3514180	our like like I think that's part of the problem is that we isn't that kind of like a yeah it's
3514180	3518660	like a that's like a senator jock coming in from jogging and going like oh it seems pretty cold
3518660	3523780	out there today global warming my foot you know like yeah it's like a well it's a response scale
3523780	3528580	it's a response to experiencing racism you have to you have you experience racism or you see it
3528580	3535380	somewhere and you have to make a decision either this is wrong and unjust or somehow I'm doing my
3535380	3539700	thing right and other people have just messed up and that's why I haven't failed is because it's
3539700	3544020	not because I got lucky it was because I did something right yeah I think that's really
3544020	3548100	important white people do that too I think that's I think that's important for Americans to recognize
3548100	3553380	and forgive is that because I think that's an it's a that's a that's a we don't want that to
3553380	3559300	be different about us that we that we mythologize the idea of individual choice and that we believe
3559300	3565380	in the mythology of like you you have that your choices make you who you are we certainly don't
3565380	3572260	want to abandon that god knows it's sometimes kind of relaxing to to just to abandon it and god knows
3572260	3578820	it it does not apply so much that you that that your unhappiness is your own fault but
3579380	3585780	right it is nice that we go that at the that that it's it's like yeah it's like it's like like
3585780	3592980	unlike the global warming example if you're a rich rapper and you go uh well I must have done
3592980	3598340	something right right like like like you want that person thinking that way because you you
3598340	3603940	don't want them thinking well I won the lottery I'm not talented at all I didn't do anything I
3603940	3609540	didn't make good choices I shouldn't I'm just uh hanging out and doing nothing like we don't want
3609540	3617220	we don't want us thinking that way we want us to think you know I I I got out of bed and I did
3617220	3621380	something and because I did it this way instead of that way now I'm a billionaire we like that
3621380	3628020	mythology yeah it'd be nice if we fucking supported it with a middle-class economy that
3628020	3633700	didn't reward you for being born rich more than people get rewarded for earning money right
3633700	3637700	exactly because that's the thing it's like it's not like that's not true it's there's also this
3637700	3642580	layer that obscures everything and makes it a bit more complicated so you can't say no that's an
3642580	3647220	entirely false premise that does not exist on planet earth it's like there's that and there's
3647220	3652420	also this thing that I was talking about you know that's still a factor I don't know it's it's it's
3652420	3656020	a shame because like that's an example of like somebody saying something incredibly provocative
3656020	3659700	that's going to put them in this crossfire but really what they're doing is is a little bit
3659700	3664260	healthier than than a lot of stuff because at least they're using their i-statements like
3664260	3670500	they're they're they're saying well all I know is this yeah this is this is my experience it gets
3670500	3675300	kind of insidious because it gets into what they call I think respectability politics which is
3675300	3679860	basically you have to shut up and deal with black on black crime or anything before you're allowed
3679860	3684820	to make any political complaint which is just a preconcition on political argument that doesn't
3684820	3689460	exist for any other race like no one has ever been like you have to solve all your problems before
3689540	3694180	you can say taxes should be different you know it's like it's fundamentally this thing that says
3694180	3698100	you're not allowed to talk about this and that's what's kind of what's insidious it was when it
3698100	3703380	builds into that narrative but it doesn't have to you know yeah that's so fucked up right yeah we
3703380	3709620	go like oh if somebody talks about the uh wealth distribution and they're rich and you go like oh
3709620	3713540	you're rich so you can't talk about it yeah don't you why don't you should give all your money away
3713540	3718420	then isn't that a logical fallacy though what's that called when you talk about the straw man
3718420	3723060	thing what's the call when you talk about like oh well this is so bad but right you know but this
3723060	3728980	is worse false equivalence false equivalence i could add hominin that's a personal attack it's
3728980	3735060	kind of like a strong hero hawk prop der hoc yeah it's if this therefore that or something well
3735060	3739780	that's because it doesn't follow i mean i don't know it's one of them because it's like saying
3739780	3744980	it's saying you're wrong because you're not adhering to this my heightened version of it that you never
3744980	3750100	said so it's kind of straw manny well as they see it they see it play out because like if a if a
3750100	3755780	if an oligarch says something like i don't see why we're spending uh tax money repairing these
3755780	3760820	potholes on martin luther king boulevard then somebody might shame them by going you don't live
3760820	3765940	in that neighborhood or i'm running for senator of this district and they go like you've never you
3765940	3771060	were born in in this place and it's like that that gets successfully and rightfully used against
3771060	3776500	like the bad guys sometimes and then but then someone goes i think prison reform should be a
3776500	3781940	thing and then someone goes like you haven't been to prison right well yeah i don't want to wait
3781940	3788020	until i get there you fuck yeah exactly but that's the thing it's like so much that's precedent in
3788020	3794900	our politics is like trying to entertain these bad faith like obstacles to even being allowed
3794900	3799140	to talk politically it's like you have to clear all these hurdles before they'll even let you
3799140	3804020	speak and it's like well no that's not that's not how it works but you have to choose to like cut
3804020	3809060	through it rather than like play by those rules and so it gets all fucked up i think then we've
3809060	3814500	been doing more uh greyhound stations in rich neighborhoods that could be big that'd be great
3814500	3819700	yeah i could see that in bel air because that's how that fire started fire started from a homeless
3819700	3826260	encampment yeah i saw this more of it i saw this kind is the story about this guy like
3826260	3834580	he was this judge this new york chief judge who spent like half his lifetime like haranguing
3834580	3840020	this woman who he was the he was in charge of her trust and because he and he was like he's doing
3840020	3843540	this whole fucked up weird thing he was like stalking her and fucking with her and all stuff
3843540	3850100	and then he got busted doing it and then he went to prison but he wrote a book well he was in prison
3850100	3854900	about how crazy it is to be a judge that gets caught being a fucking criminal and then so then
3854980	3860580	when he got out of prison he was a best-selling author and then he they they welcomed him back
3860580	3866820	into the the the you know whatever the fuck he could still hang out at the country club and all
3866820	3871300	this stuff and he and the the woman's life was ruined and stuff but like and then they played
3871300	3876500	a clip of him being on larry king or something and he uh after prison yeah after all of this
3876500	3881220	and now he was he's on his victory lap like like making his millions on his book about how how
3881300	3886580	much he's you know learned about how not to get killed in prison or it's or it's like you know
3886580	3890980	meditations on how how nutty it is to be a judge and then be in prison and then be a best-selling
3890980	3897220	author like by me and and uh i wrote a book called how to uh learn how to make a prison belt
3897220	3902660	and larry larry king goes like how it's in the clip larry king's going like now you uh i can't
3902660	3908580	do a larry king impression but you know so you but you you did you did terrible things you you
3908580	3914660	did them you you you you you ruined this woman's life and then he goes oh yeah no absolutely i
3914660	3922660	mean it's what i did there's no there's no excuse for it you know you you find yourself um doing
3922660	3927540	this thing and you you you you you do this and then you do that you do that i was like i was like
3927540	3932580	because i've been in therapy i'm like ah he's a fucking like like like that that you thing no
3932580	3938020	that royal you it's it's like it's like i do that all the time he's taking it away from himself
3938020	3942340	yeah it's and it's it's like it's like compulsive and i i know that seems like a non-sequitur but
3942340	3947060	it's like it's kind of like what we're doing when we talk about politics like we we're constantly
3947060	3954580	like tap dancing between like we don't want intimacy we don't want to just be vulnerable
3954580	3959380	because we might end up saying something that's that's not very fashionable and actually gets
3959380	3964820	tomatoes thrown at us like well i'm a rich black baseball player so america been very good to me
3964820	3968740	you know like bill garrett morris bit or whatever like sammy so is that sammy so
3970980	3979540	like you you don't so we have to like you like we like we're constantly like as as as primates
3979540	3985620	like we we we feel like we can't just go through life actually just expressing ourselves because
3985700	3992980	we'll well then we'll get we'll get beaten up for being like just kind of like i don't know what
3992980	3998980	we'll call that narcissism or tunnel vision or selfishness but like so you you get rewarded over
3998980	4004020	time for like talking about how the world should be or what the world's feeling or because that's
4004020	4008340	empathy well i know how that person feels about stuff but then that turns into this whole different
4008340	4014740	kind of like uh uh total pandering yeah like you don't even it's just association like you're still
4014740	4020020	a sociopath because now you're talking about everyone but yourself you're you're not selfless
4020020	4026580	by doing that you can be a fucking horrible like person that's just like oh i'm certainly
4026580	4031380	i'm not gonna sit in my own skin during this conversation i'm gonna be everyone else in the
4031380	4037220	world which is what politicians are really good at like that's all they do man what do you need
4037940	4045140	nine eleven holy shit nine eleven oh shut up why don't you make a golem it's crazy man i wanted to
4045140	4050660	learn about it because it is this weird quintessentially jewish mythology that's also like a
4050660	4056260	dragon it's like what if like there was like this famous muggle muslim pegasus or like you know a
4056260	4062100	famous sphinx or something it's just really weird a famous catholic leprechaun a catholic leprechaun
4062100	4070020	yeah the catholic the giant leprechaun of of of saint james cathedral there are catholic giants
4070020	4078180	dick and catholic zombies they're with me famed i'm going to send an irish golem after him
4079380	4088180	i am at your command bagash and bagora what you need man go slay my enemies
4088740	4098260	i will do that a big top of the morning i find it i find the only racist part of of the the great
4098260	4103380	irish leprechaun of saint james cathedral is that he's famous for sucking his own dick
4104020	4110340	but not famous for being a giant leprechaun well a lot of people say he's a normal person right
4110900	4114900	okay yeah so he's he's the world's tallest giant a lot of people accuse him of being a five foot
4115300	4118500	so he might just be a guy that sucks his own dick he's five eleven but so is his dick
4120020	4124340	it's a big old ripping rope you know by the way as far as jewish mythology
4124340	4130660	listeners to our podcast will know that uh the jewish community created uh another uh math a
4130660	4136180	modern myth called superman two jewish kids created superman oh yeah they're always making
4136180	4142740	stuff those jews but they cannot they pronounced it superman superman superman was the original
4143540	4150420	with superman spotterman superman clerk it's so it's i think it's upon a time because i know but
4150420	4155460	it's still so i mean it's also probably beyond that but it's like just it really is funny just
4155460	4160820	saying superman anytime you have like a man word that you can say like with the min instead it's
4160820	4169300	always like that was the one there the uh the goy editor at the dc comics was like boys look i
4169380	4174500	love superman can we make it two words can we but could we just i you know could we just i don't
4174500	4180500	want to uh it was a very touchy time it's the 1930s i don't want to go there i don't want to
4180500	4188020	compromise you it could we just pronounce it different superman superman the boys and then
4188020	4191860	the two brothers are like out in the sidewalk because like they it divides them down the middle
4191860	4198020	it's like this is for our fucking uncle uh you don't call it iceberg yeah
4200500	4207380	superman it's a burger it was the one stick and the other brother is like we take the this one
4207380	4213380	thing and then we have the first jewish character in popular culture pick your battles pick your

4443940	4449300	repeated but that's more for him because as soon as he says he's gonna sell us ass to mouth
4450420	4455780	everyone acts like they just heard the most recognizable sentence in the world like they're
4455860	4462500	under duress they're bound and dead he's gonna sell us ass to mouth oh oh no oh no not that

4493860	4500820	mouth that isn't that old that old that old primal uh fear someone's sewing you ass to mouth that
4500820	4506340	old that phrase that triggers an immediate crisis and it's circular too it's circular is it a closed
4506340	4513060	circuit i'm not gonna oh no i don't want to be sewn ass to mouth who does i was talking to dino
4513060	4518660	recently that dogs would love to be sewn ass to mouth that's probably but but to what that would
4518660	4524100	be that like they love shit that's my dog get a bunch of dog heaven it's just it's just an
4524100	4530180	endless string of dogs right muzzle attached to another dog canine centipede that's not a horror
4530180	4534420	movie i think we just gotta be though it's gotta be all the way around that's a pixar feel good
4534420	4541860	yeah it's centipede is like awakenings yeah it's like a silent oscar movie or it's cat cat cat cat
4541860	4547780	cat dog yeah they love i had a dog when i was in new york as a kid that dog loved to eat horse
4547780	4552900	shit just we just eat it like it was just dogs love horse shit you know it just just couldn't get
4552900	4558260	enough horse shit my dog grew up on horse shit yeah yeah that's why his coat was so shiny she
4558260	4563860	grew up on a horse shit farm that's the secret you know dogs have a secret and that's redefined
4563860	4570660	success yeah like they eat horse shit they're like fuck yeah i'm nailing it there's grass in
4570660	4576260	here he didn't finish this elephants and like a lot of herbivores go back and eat their own poop
4576260	4581780	because like we kind of digested none of that right my stomachs aren't made to really well cellulose
4581780	4587140	it's hard to break down we should redefine the vegetative cell wall is eating almost impossible
4587140	4594340	to digest animals that have developed to graze have intensely crazy labyrinthine digestive
4594340	4598740	systems that are capable of somewhat breaking down grass because they're like imagine that's
4598740	4604500	like being able to desalinate ocean water it'd be like if you could do it all of our problems
4604500	4608260	are over but it's really fucking hard to do it and meanwhile tigers are like why don't you just
4608260	4612980	grow claws and eat you well because we can't all eat me you can drink a little of your own pee if
4613060	4618020	you're really thirsty and it doesn't fuck you up but then they shit bricks of hay basically because
4618020	4625380	you can even even if you're a fucking elephant with all of the if we eat grass we would probably
4625380	4630500	we would poop just grass it would just be grass and like whatever we should try like a philly
4630500	4635220	cheesesteak physical challenge what would that look like if humans just ate that much grass
4635220	4639300	you'd be sorry continue i think we would just we would we would we would starve to death because
4639300	4648020	we would be like we can't even break down the cellulose cellulose um in grass like like like
4648020	4655540	grazing plants like we can eat a carrot but we can't eat grass because it's just grass is just
4655540	4660980	made out of fucking kevlar like like like like the amount of like shit that it takes to turn that
4660980	4668420	into food it's not worth it yeah and so when they poop it's like it's a bunch of grass and that's
4668660	4673860	and then the elephant next to you goes like what are you what are you doing yeah and it's like well
4673860	4677460	i'm shitting it because i have to i was gonna take it for another spin he's like well can i do
4677460	4681300	you mind you you're already you're already facing that way are you mind no go ahead knock yourself
4681300	4685460	out when they get right up in there eat the poop off the butt sometimes yeah they put the trunk
4685460	4691220	everybody elephants elephants stick is trunk right up another elephant's ass a trunk up an ass it's
4691220	4695460	gross pull out a brick but you don't eat from their trunk they eat from their mouth no they pull
4695540	4700020	they grab it and then they use their trunk like a hand yeah pull a brick this has got to be like a
4700020	4704500	thing they do once in a while as a joke or like a terrible cap counting youtube videos of it i'm
4704500	4708980	telling you it's got to be a thing like different angles are the same thing and giraffes drink piss
4708980	4713620	you'll find this is also true there's at least seven videos of people freaking the fuck out
4713620	4717700	because they think that they're the first and last person to ever see an elephant reach its trunk up
4717700	4723460	another elephant's asshole pull a turd out and eat it they're they're justifiably very excited
4723460	4729940	they're like the word bob saget has never been exclaimed so many times but but but the jokes on
4729940	4734580	them because they're part of a playlist the club like bunch of people at the brooklyn zoo seeing
4734580	4740260	an elephant eat its own shit for the first time what if this is a captivity thing uh i don't well
4740260	4744740	it could very well be something that gets i'm calling captivity on this you know about the
4744740	4748660	chimpanzee frog thing i mean we don't need to rehash too many we gotta retire the podcast because
4748660	4752500	we're just saying the same i don't know about the chimpanzee just go google when you go home tonight
4752580	4758020	google chimpanzee frog there's nothing a champ won't do chip mansees will put a frog on their
4758020	4762500	deck and just kill it and throw it away like a like a used condom they'll they'll go worse than
4762500	4769780	kill it like we'll kill a buffalo and then not use all of it um a chimpanzee won't bother killing
4769780	4777620	the frog it'll just it just uses it it'll just load it and then and then just throws it like a
4777620	4784660	loofah in in a public shower uh and and the frog you have you you that frog's never gonna walk the
4784660	4790340	same it takes a lot to watch a video about a fucking primate that has 99.5 percent of your
4790340	4797380	dna and identify with a reptile like there's a serious crime happening when you're like
4797380	4804020	i'm the frog uh you just did something horrible like you don't think you don't feel that way
4804020	4808180	about the termites when it dips the stick in but like these things will fuck up a frog
4811140	4814900	if he wouldn't use the stick the frog's gotta have some sort of special shape it's like a you
4814900	4820020	know it's it's probably evolution actually basically like all chimpanzees are are what
4820020	4825860	we like all chimpanzees are sociopaths like they're they're like we're fascinated by serial killers
4825860	4831140	and mafia hitmen and things like that we go like oh it's like they don't even they don't have an
4831140	4835540	empathic response like that's all chimps are just like they're like looking at the frog and they're
4835540	4842260	like what's this thing look at this look at this mouth looks like a chimp's pussy the frog's like
4846900	4853620	i have a face can't you see that yeah no i saw it i'm but they're kind of asking for it because
4853620	4860900	they're always out there going rub it give me a break that's all the time we have for tonight
4862100	4868820	rub it that's not even oh that's what a horny to it says it's not a horny to it says rub it
4868820	4873140	i mean they say they say budweiser because they're drunk and they asked for it because they've been
4873140	4876740	drinking all this budweiser they're asking again you're telling me if you didn't think of that joke
4876740	4887380	you would have kept it to yourself i don't know man i've yeah i don't know yeah and that's why
4887380	4891460	that you would be turned by the nazis in one day like that's how i feel like that's more evidence
4891460	4895220	than i wouldn't be because i would be i was like i was like well i needed to rhyme with ribbit
4896900	4903380	it can't it can't change a whole vowel but different cultures say cockadoodle do yeah
4903380	4909300	well okay so a french dog supposedly says yeah or whatever else says that's what it says
4912660	4917220	i love that section of uh your foreign language in high school that's a whole fucking chapter of
4917700	4922100	let's learn what a cow says in france are you out of your mind cow says yani in french
4923060	4932500	says spiegel in german check us a lock in cats say green needle and the yugoslavian ones say

5185220	5192100	ass to mouth that's yeah that's can you do that yeah you can do that i realize our policy of not
5192100	5197140	shouting out the people who are actively working for us probably makes them feel like it's okay to
5197140	5201700	go out of town for for a show but last thing we want to do is reward them when they do that
5202500	5206340	right it's like that's like that's like how to stay that's like the principle and the morning
5206340	5209860	announcements going like let's go let's let's talk about who's playing hooky today who's in

5225620	5229620	like the format was a little wobbly at the top of the show zach kind of usually brings this stuff
5229620	5233140	he makes it sound funny so maybe this is the person operating the scissor lift
5233460	5238820	right i would love to hear that sound right now i would love we have no audience but we have we
5238820	5244660	have 500 teamsters that are required to be here but they have to be absolutely quiet
5245380	5250340	uh they're all they they have six scissor lifts if you if you turn these cameras around it looks
5250340	5257060	like um lord of the rings uh like outside the castle like the orc army there's just like there's
5257140	5260660	there's there's there's some there's ollie fonts and there's like blue ghosts

5372980	5377140	like a little toupee you mean a yarmulke is i trying to say i was gonna say shmata
5377140	5382180	yeah did you you changed the shape of your hat in solidarity because we were
5382180	5385700	skewing anti-semitic so you wanted to balance it was a coincidence it was just sort of one of those
5385700	5392980	things that happened that uh we'll never know why sometimes like as as a goy goyum i don't know how
5392980	5402020	that works steve either is um in in Yiddish or Yiddish or Hebrew i also don't know that
5402020	5408500	Yiddish is like slang right it's like it is a eastern european language that was spoken by
5408500	5415140	jewish people and so words that end with um is that like plural in yeah it's like there's a
5415140	5422020	goy and then there's a bunch of goyum is that yeah all right it's a flock of goyum and it's a
5422020	5432500	murder of latkes that's what the golem oh it's golem gallon all right steve break us down from
5432500	5439460	the perspective of the person that that that keeps that keeps caring what we're doing about
5439460	5444020	time i mean like i don't know someone says next saturday to me i'm like this is the last show in
5444020	5448820	the venue this is the last show we're doing here at starburns are you shitting me yep yeah last
5448820	5453700	night jesus we should have done something are we bringing the bed with us is a bed stain no
5453700	5459540	bed is coming along and it's gonna play the piano where no we're gonna be in this is the last time
5459540	5464020	we're not going to be in front of people yeah man this is the end of our isolation yeah come back
5464020	5468580	when it's in front of people yeah it'll be better but more importantly what should we do before
5468580	5474340	that we can't do in front of people oh shit um so i should have brought my minecraft laptop let's
5474340	5484740	sew ourselves ass to mouth oh wow well see that's significant what is like who if we're
5484740	5490980	all going to do that who sows you gotta do it simultaneously what's the workflow on us
5490980	5496420	sewing ourselves ass to mouth with each other well you're uh you're you're a centipede syndicalist
5496420	5500980	you believe that that that it should be worked into the centipede i don't believe in mutual
5500980	5510100	i mean yeah i i'm more of a reciprocity based how about magnets no i believe that there should
5510100	5515140	always be a doctor in order for there to be a centipede you could do it as a you could put
5515140	5520100	electromagnets in our mouths and then the other side of the electromagnet on a butt
5520820	5526340	and then you just have everyone has control of the switch so if you want to a lot of people
5526340	5532980	would say jeff that if it's not sewn it's not a centipede because it's like we aren't we already
5532980	5536500	don't we already have the option of putting our lips on each other's buttholes and eating
5536500	5541460	all the poop from each other's butts i'm saying the control of the switch like it it switches
5541460	5550020	around like you can have control for like eight hours it's a liberal fantasy you know you gotta
5550020	5556740	choose you do you want my lips in your asshole it's you okay let's say i saw steve leave his
5556740	5563140	mouth to your butthole okay i'm i'm listening have i got your attention i'm all i'm all ears
5564740	5572020	and then it's my turn to have your mouth sewn to my butt i can't sew that so yeah that's what i'm
5572020	5578100	saying you need a doctor pemberton sews my your mouth to my butt we got spencer's left
5578900	5584900	all right but now we don't we have we got both of you left i don't think that the doctor
5584900	5590980	says spencer sews pemberton's mouth to my butt at the very end when it's time for spencer's
5590980	5596180	mouth and to be sewn to a butt and mouth and butt to a mouth we're gonna have to all get into kind
5596180	5601860	of like circle the wagons yeah and so we're gonna we're all gonna they're gonna get into a circle
5601860	5606500	and that's the most exciting part because at that point we'll be able to form a human wheel
5606500	5612020	and roll at high speeds that's where the term sewing circle comes from right you do raise an
5612020	5617060	interesting point about the human centipede mythos i've watched all three of those movies and i and i
5617060	5625940	cannot pin the characters or the director down and whether or not he thinks that uh having your lips
5625940	5631460	sewn to another person's butt is a good thing or a bad thing i don't i don't understand how it works
5632020	5637060	they what would you understand because i mean you would just do you have the question that poop is
5637060	5641460	not food is that your problem no no no it's not that at all it's more like imagine your lips being
5641460	5647620	sewed to someone else's asshole right yeah right you're gonna lose the ability to use your your
5647620	5653220	mandible right so it's like if someone shits like a giant log you're fucking you're joking and
5653220	5657700	dying and then soft but you gotta breathe through your nose well you gotta hope you're gonna have
5657860	5662900	to you gotta start furiously furiously swallowing that poop well i thought where i thought you were
5662900	5667620	going is like this isn't how skin works it's not like welding you're gonna rip your fucking lips
5667620	5672660	off somebody's yeah that's the truth yeah you will just rip apart for me it asks the important
5672660	5675780	question what's more important to you ripping off the front of your face or eating some of that
5675780	5680900	delicious i suspended my disbelief on the lip stuff but but if someone's taking a giant turd in your
5680900	5687460	mouth you can't you can't suspend your your but he also he feeds them special food you haven't
5687460	5692740	watched these movies no no he doesn't feed him like fucking broccoli and chicken okay like he
5692740	5698340	makes him eat like fucking protein broth and stuff like he wants him to have diarrhea stuff
5698340	5703620	it's it's all very it's like the guy explains it you haven't watched these movies is it here it's
5703620	5710100	like a udukir wannabe huh i don't know what that is the actor udukir what's that are you kidding
5710980	5716820	udukir i think here is dick and farsi i'm gonna look it up you guys you guys know who udukir is
5716820	5723700	do you know who's hola is he's an actor he's like a he's got crazy eyes he's been in a bunch of
5724580	5732660	war hall movies he was in blood for dracula he's uh whatever udukir udukir
5733860	5739060	all right leave you tell the tell the tell the people from so from here now the next time they

5782260	5785940	oh it's because it's memorial day or something oh it's memorial day yeah don't put it on me
5785940	5791940	yeah we couldn't fucking celebrate 22nd at the wilbur theater 23rd on long island at the
5791940	5800020	cradle aviation museum for the uh for the that convention if we didn't do shows when i didn't
5800020	5809940	feel like doing them we that's the show we have well i i mean going away is that's a that's not
5809940	5816020	necessarily your fault it's it's his fault yeah i'm just saying it's okay to go away
5816020	5820900	memorial day is bigger than me and my needs it's about our nation's soldiers
5820900	5829140	it's about 9 11 it's about uh it's about 9 11 it's about war and yellow ribbons and supporting
5829140	5839620	things david geta memory it's about deer hunter it's about uh it's about uh michael man
5839620	5848420	transformers it's about carnival of the dead it's about independence day the movie even though
5848420	5852820	it's a different holiday right but it's more about it's more of a memorial day movie for me
5852820	5858020	yeah because it's about our armed services yeah well i think you know there's not a heavy
5858020	5863540	thanksgiving element to wizard of oz but people have come to why i think you're right um uh
5863540	5867220	independence day is a great memorial day movie it's for me it's the only one
5867540	5877380	which is why i fc plays it on the loop for 24 hours huh oh for christ's sake um all right
5877380	5882340	pemberton plugged he's got a cassette tape that's part of this giant subscription that you can get
5882340	5887300	where you get a tape every week do you have a show kiss my ass too yeah kiss my ass is every

5891700	5896580	in Denver do you know that Anna of uh Zach McKeever fame who is currently asked to mouth
5896580	5902900	in Seattle with our zach uh-huh produces that show is she producing Anna Hasneum probably yeah
5903540	5910260	yes true she produces it it's true i i know her when she's not eagerly gobbling poop out of Zach's
5910260	5917540	puddle well a german scientist who we will never be able to pin down on his feelings about it
5918340	5921380	keep saying yes yes yes
5924420	5930500	well it's the next stage in human evolution i mean he says that but right i just i don't i don't
5930500	5934740	but he doesn't understand that you can't eat poop and then like when it turns out you can't he's
5934740	5939460	like wait what but also he's like stoked about how it's uncomfortable for them right like he's
5939460	5943780	like yeah i love making you do it because you hate it survival of fitness so you don't like it
5943780	5948740	like you don't think a human should be eating shit because you you actually are just a regular
5948740	5953700	guy that just like hates like hitchhikers or whoever these people are that came to your
5953700	5960500	german lair right just a masochist right sadist sadist sorry he's i think he i think he's doling
5960500	5966580	at what he considers the ultimate punishment he's not he's not into it he's he's he's into making
5966580	5973300	people bummed out in the original movie the original movie uh he he that's the tv that's
5973300	5978500	the the chuck laurie's uh human centipede jump bummed out that's the canadian that's actually
5978500	5984340	what the singularity is the canadian dave foley's in it that's the singularity is when they remake
5984340	5993700	the human centipede every once in a while you gotta take what you're giving forming new friends
5993700	6002740	in a circle of friends bummed out sometimes life throws stuff at you and sometimes you throw stuff
6002740	6009940	at life be friends with the person behind you it's giving as good as you get and giving it back
6009940	6017860	paying it forward taking it back i'm with you and we're on the right track bummed out
6017860	6028180	dave foley is the bumbling sadistic german scientist i was on the road with dave foley
6028180	6032500	for a couple weeks and he's a fucking joy he's absolutely a sweetheart and fuck is he funny
6033140	6039700	so funny uh well i hope he is okay with the fact that when he comes on the show there's
6039700	6045540	going to be a fucking audience because we just burnt up our last delicious taste of no audience
6045540	6050100	i think he is born in front of an audience i think he's a he's a he's a born performer what
6050100	6056500	do we do what's the last we're never going to be in total silence in a dark empty warehouse ever
6056500	6060900	again what what what's the thing you always wanted to do spencer already pitched asked
6060900	6065220	to mount centipede yeah uh dan you should say all those things that you don't like saying in
6065220	6071380	front of an audience because they'll because they make weird sounds right okay uh uh race
6071380	6082660	uh oh wait no i'm making the sounds uh uh 85 percent of everyone is stupid and that actually
6082660	6095860	does include 85 of whatever group you belong to believe me i've met you i'm stupid oh maybe 85%
6095860	6106740	chance four of us are uh this is a group uh i don't like okay here's a good one i just
6106740	6112660	better get this out before we have an audience uh i recognize it as a well executed movie
6112660	6118180	compared to the sony versions uh i think it's a waste of spider-man to just turn him into a
6118180	6125540	ai suit uh with tony stark just providing him with uh uh spider-man suit what's this
6127300	6132500	you know the new spider-man is the it's like i have he gets a new suit from tony stark and
6132500	6139060	it's like this suit is like talking to him like jarvis and i like that i get the complaints the
6139060	6144740	thing is like in the story of like civil war and everything that did happen but it's like that's
6144740	6150260	not like a quintessential spider-man story it's not like a reboot spider-man story it's like this
6150260	6155060	very like that's like the seventh spider-man movie can be about oh now he has a spider-man
6155060	6160740	ai suit it's kind of an interesting choice for you know for what's essentially like a reboot like
6160740	6166900	setting off the it's weird yeah did you like that uh in a quiet place did we talk about this i
6166900	6173140	haven't seen it and i won't watch it and here's why i don't like uh deaf people movies no i'm
6173140	6180500	kidding i i i'm just trying to think of like the uh things to say before an audience comes back
6181380	6185380	uh you can turn all the shit you want about the death i can't talk about it and i haven't
6185380	6193300	watched atlanta how about dead cool too soon dead tool that's that's that's all i keep saying is
6193300	6202500	haven't watched atlanta um devil to choose very meta it's enjoyable meta how meta it's way up its
6202500	6209620	own ass i never would i never met a satin watch themselves filming it pretty much it's like yeah
6209620	6215620	does it reference the first one like like like yeah it's all playback it references everything
6215620	6223620	it references the avengers does reference video assist that could be big almost actually yeah
6223620	6229460	the whole movie takes place in video village yeah i thought there was there's an element of
6229460	6234660	rewind play fast forward in there how many how many people is there in our theater the new venue
6234660	6244420	hold 500 yeah for real no not at all 200 i think it's 150 but 150 it's a good amount it's really
6244420	6250420	really nice seats right it's great great sound and we're looking at it in the prestigious stabbing
6250420	6255140	district of downtown los angeles right that you will want to bring pepper spray you usually can
6255220	6260340	get it on clearance of fries yes run don't walk from your car to the theater to see herman town
6260980	6264900	well you will have to run from your car because you have to park so fucking far away that you
6264900	6270020	don't have to be late just lift or uber or carpool or some trick if you lift you'll be safe
6270580	6277780	yeah pull up pull up pull right up to the front we'll have a paparazzi out there for you that
6277780	6281780	could be cool we should do that for our big opening we should hire a red carpet should we
6281780	6288260	do a hand bone like like paparazzi red carpet thing as long as i don't have to do anything
6288260	6293460	have to commit yeah yeah i just did i just pictured you out there crack it down rolling
6293460	6301380	out some carpet staple gun in hand yeah hot glue and some some do some appliques onto a thing
6301380	6307460	you want to do some step and turns step and turns yeah repeat is it uh i believe it's really trying
6307540	6312100	to think i'm trying to think of the thing oh uh one more thing is before we before we're back
6312100	6318020	in front of an audience i don't like poor people and i don't have to um because i what i grew up
6318020	6325060	poor enough that i i know that you there's nothing magical about being poor you you can be poor and
6325060	6329780	be a fucking dumb asshole just as easily as you can be born rich and be a dumb asshole you're
6329780	6336660	like a white Kanye without all the genius so when so when you say to me on instagram uh hey
6336980	6342260	why don't you stop doing what you're currently doing and do what i tell you to do and i tell you
6342260	6348420	to go fuck your mother you dumb broke hillbilly fuck face uh and stop giving me advice about the
6348420	6352900	hair on my shoulders in my shower because your life sucks because you're a fucking loser
6354020	6360580	and you try to play the class system fucking card with me you can double fuck yourself with a with
6360580	6366260	a hundred poor dicks because uh i made myself out of dirt without permission and that's exactly why
6366260	6374740	you can go fuck yourself because i'm 45 years old so i'm better than you um i made myself rich
6374740	6382020	so i'm better than you i'm uh i'm i'm i'm i have i have a differently shaped brain than yours and
6382020	6387300	that doesn't make me better than you but it makes me luckier than you which makes me better than you
6387300	6394180	because capitalism so stop telling me what to do because by every rule you hold important you have
6394180	6400500	to shut the fuck up forever all the time whenever you're in my presence because you're a lower person

6432820	6436260	and candy what if you got bernie made off and some horrible shit happened then you couldn't
6436260	6441300	make money and you lost everything and you were a poor guy again i'd be a poor guy who proved he
6441300	6446340	was better than other people by having made myself rich and then i'd be twice as angry about being

6493460	6501380	helping because i knew that part but um uh shit i had it on the tip of my tongue fuck lost it
6502340	6506980	lost it what if you if something about you say like what if you could make me what if you what
6506980	6513460	have you made me poor what if you lost everything oh oh i know what it is because you you implied
6513460	6517540	that if i say oh people have been trying to make me poor and they can't beat me and all this stuff
6517540	6522420	here's the thing another thing you get off my chest before before we make up with the audience
6522420	6526500	and we we entertain them because they're gonna buy tickets and we're gonna be like you're good
6526500	6530420	people like like some of you are bad people but we're gonna like pretend you're good people this
6530500	6536820	this little anti-poor monologue is ticket sales gold right it doesn't also we don't
6536820	6543620	hear if one person shows up for the show that we did doubled our zero audience i'm invincible
6543620	6549380	we're also charging uh ticket master prices so i think i think yes eight hundred dollars for the
6549380	6554020	first 20 rows is eight hundred dollars but and ironically those are the seats that are the worst
6554020	6559300	because when i do my wire fly you're gonna get kicked in the face i actually i'm gonna be
6559300	6564180	comp trolling is this is this a spoiler to say that i'm my comp trolling uh lectern it's gonna be
6570180	6578500	no my therapist and i are working on i have to get over this idea that if you say i'm a great
6578500	6584260	person you can't beat me i'm wonderful i'm having a good life that that means that an anvil is going
6584340	6589860	to fall on your head like that's a that's a that's a that's a normally healthy thing
6589860	6594660	because you're not supposed to be a pompous cock and like right that's a normally healthy thing
6594660	6599220	that's a normally healthy thing but but for me it's like you know carbs are normally healthy
6599220	6604580	for some people but like i have to be on a diet that like your rage about about the poor attacking
6606020	6611700	well you don't have to know okay i have to know yeah yeah you what you know doesn't matter
6612580	6616660	and that won't and it won't have negative repercussions on me because it's okay for
6616660	6622980	me to be confident and certain about what makes me happy there won't be negative repercussions
6622980	6630100	because i was satisfied with myself or my work or my life or anything was good enough
6630100	6636260	like there is no punishment from the universe for me being okay with the way the day is going
6636260	6642420	and there there's no there's no reason for me to check in and make sure that's okay with you
6642420	6646740	that's something that everybody else needs to do because they're fucking stupid and they need to
6646740	6652340	grow and be better people i have become you're just god where does poverty come into this though
6652340	6657060	you you you sort of more mad about because my money is a direct measure of my worth as a person
6657060	6661220	my accomplishment i don't know what are you talking about you're more mad at stupid people than
6661540	6667060	than whether they have money in the bank i right i don't i don't know what what you're you just did
6667060	6671140	a giant rant about your your poor people poor people or animals i don't know if i did a giant
6671140	6677380	rant about anything that's your subjective what i what i what i said was if you're on instagram
6677940	6683220	and i tell you to go fuck yourself and one of the things i tell you that is a reason why you
6683220	6688100	shouldn't be telling me what to do is because your dumb ass is broke in addition to you being
6688100	6693060	anonymous living with your parents having accomplished nothing having a life half the
6693060	6698820	length of mind not making anyone happy and not following me and you're following me instead of
6698820	6703700	i'm following you there's a million reasons why if you really think about it it's fucking dumb for
6703700	6709460	you to ever open your mouth around me like like you don't have to then you're not going to get
6709460	6717940	away with saying to me uh oh that makes you uh a Lannister because it it doesn't like like you're
6717940	6725140	you're a fucking idiot and a gross little uh dirty filthy piglet and being broke is a part of that
6726260	6728900	because because because there's not a lot of rich people doing it
6729620	6734500	like like getting it watching me take a shower on my instagram feed and telling me that i need to
6734500	6741620	get my shoulders like uh d-d-d-d hair or whatever there's a there's not a lot of rich people doing
6741620	6748020	that maybe maybe that's the connection i don't know james woods james woods is is in my instagram
6748020	6755460	telling me to to get hair removal he's a troll oh he's a big time troll uh you're 15 you're poor
6756180	6764580	your parents are they fucked up um you you you you you're a failure you're gonna die uh miserable
6765140	6769060	um and you won't even know it you'll think you're happy that's how miserable and dumb you are
6769060	6773620	you can't even you can't even detect misery as much as i can i have more uh emotional taste buds
6773620	6780980	than you um it's probably a bad time to announce your run for congress yeah uh all right i think
6780980	6787300	it's all i think it's all out so then we'll next time you see me oops this has definitely been
6787300	6795060	worked out it's certainly done it's all done well i think you're being sarcastic and you're
6795060	6799140	suggesting that something bad happened well no i'm not i'm just like it seems like i don't think
6802020	6806740	is it was it is it difficult for you to sit and listen to me say a bunch of stuff and then go
6806820	6812340	ah that's great is that a tough choice for you as a performer are you yeah yeah okay
6813780	6820580	let's switch roles like like like say a bunch of stuff all right i love poor people and yeah yeah
