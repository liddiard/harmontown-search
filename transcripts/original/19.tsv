0	16200	Here you hear ye, Harminetown is now in session.
16200	18520	How is everyone out there tonight?
18520	21400	Oh, yes.
21400	26760	Welcome once again, Harminians, Harminites, put your hands together for the mayor of Harminetown,
26760	28760	Mr. Dan Harminetown.
28760	43320	Yo, yo, yo, yo, okay, yo, sugar fried titties in your butt and your mouth, fucked your
43320	48960	mama north, fucked your mama south, salt, pepper, pepper, salt, fucked your mama so
48960	54680	hard she turned into asphalt, I've turned her ass into a road, lying down the middle,
54680	59760	she is a horny toad, took my big dick, split her down the middle, cat in the spoon and
59760	65320	the moon in the fiddle, fucked your mama like she was a pancake, fucked your mama orgasms
65320	70800	weren't faked, flipped her up in the air and then down, fucked your mama's smile into a
70800	80960	frown, gotta dance, gotta dance tonight, make your mama feel right, gotta dance tonight,
80960	89800	break it down, fuck your mama, I fucked your mama, this is the whole show tonight you guys,
89800	95000	I fucked your mama, I fucked your mama, 80 minutes of freestyle rap, fuck your mama down,
95000	100120	fucked your mama's smile up into a frown, fucked your mama's glasses back into her head,
100120	105680	look like a librarian instead, fucked your mama's face, fucked her inner nose, fucked
105680	110520	your mama, that's how it goes, I'm trying to tell you that I fucked your mom, don't
110520	116080	you understand, I haven't been unclear, fucked your mama, your daddy just watched, I fucked
116080	121240	your mama and your daddy just sat there, fucked your mama and your daddy didn't do nothing,
121240	134160	fucked your mama, your daddy was the victim, maybe we'll start each show with a freestyle
134160	140080	rap from now on, we can say this, nobody could accuse you of beating around the bush about
140080	145640	whether or not you fucked someone's mama now, I am not soft on mamas, you were very
145640	151080	candid about fucking someone's mama, if emceeing, is that what it's called, emceeing, is that
151080	157040	when you rap, if emceeing was an elected position, my platform would not involve being soft on
157040	161880	your mama, I would be tough on her, which is probably why I'd never get elected, I don't
161880	167160	think that position should be up for focus, 51% of the population is women, they don't
167160	172240	want to elect somebody as an emcee that's going to just fuck everyone's mama, because
172240	175920	I didn't hear anything in that rap, Jeff, scrutinizing myself, I didn't hear anything
175920	181600	in that rap about consensual sex, but none of her orgasms were fake, that's true, she
181600	187280	did like it, you fucked her glasses into her head, which is a little disturbing, I fucked
187280	193040	them on top of her head, she embedded them into her, no, no, no, no, that's violent,
194040	199320	break it down, give me a beat, we'll clarify that your mama liked it, your mama likes it,
199320	210560	yeah, here we go, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, when I fuck your mama, she likes it a lot,
210560	215840	I fuck her so hard, her nose runs with snot, that's, it's kinda gross, but she likes it,
215840	221600	it's wild abandon, it's like, she likes it, you know, like life cereal, your mama likes
221600	226800	it so much, fuck her for real, I might marry her, I might give her a ring, fuck your mama
226800	232640	so good the bitch starts to sing, she goes, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I like to get fucked
232640	241640	by Dan Harmon, ooh, ooh, ooh, fuck me in the morning, Dan Harmon, alright, there's a little
241640	248240	hook there, thank you, thank you folks, thank you, now we got the ladies on our side, that's
248240	253280	good, so you gotta, you gotta, don't forget the sensitivity, it's too much, too much misogyny
253280	258480	in rap, you gotta, women don't, you know, must get tired of that stereotype that men
258480	264360	are only after young ladies, you know, you're after mamas, you know, mamas are still sexy,
264360	270800	can I ask you as an objective observer, because I go into a kind of fugue state when I rap,
270800	277000	I become a, I become a, just a science dropper, like I don't, I don't, I don't have consciousness,
277000	283560	it's just moving through me like a channel, why, what do I do when I'm rapping that results
283560	287640	in me being out of breath, why, it seems like I'm just rapping, why am I out of breath?
287640	289280	You do your little toddler dance.
289280	294840	Right, but that doesn't seem like exercise, like, but I guess, also you're, you're, you're
294840	297960	doing more exhaling than inhaling, probably, if you're doing it right.
297960	298960	Okay, that's what it is.
298960	302600	But you have that, that respiratory alkalosis thing, so that's good for you, I'd say, yeah,
302600	303600	you breathe too much.
304200	309000	Sorry, I got my new phone and I don't know how to, it's pretty, it's pretty big.
309000	310000	Look at this fucking thing.
310000	311000	He got, what is this called?
311000	312000	The Samsung Gigantor?
312000	313000	Yeah.
313000	314800	It's an iPad.
314800	317080	Some people call it a phablet.
317080	318080	A phablet?
318080	321080	Part phone, part tablet, nope.
321080	324560	Nobody calls, no one calls it that.
324560	329600	I defected from Apple, it fits, it fits almost in my pocket.
330600	333360	Yeah, it's, it's large.
333360	334360	It's large.
334360	338080	I, I, Aaron keeps suggesting that I got it because I'm so old that I like, that's like
338080	342960	a big phone for old people, like I could, and that's kind of true, like I, I am able
342960	346320	to thumb type faster on it.
346320	352160	I think it's a crime that I'm not able to, you know, when I was, I've always, ever since
352160	357160	I was like 15 years old, I've always loved having like little devices and things, even
357160	359280	though at 15, what do you, what do you need them for?
359280	364000	To schedule your chronic master patient or to like remind yourself to ask for another
364000	365000	one next Christmas.
365000	367520	Like there was nothing I needed them for, but I just loved them.
367520	370960	They're like, like, like made me feel like, like penny and inspector gadget to have like
370960	376440	a little, I should have just tried pigtails and saved my parents like 10K a year on these
376440	377440	little gadgets.
377440	381080	But I always want, and that was before the internet was a thing and certainly before
381080	384400	the internet could be a repository for personal information.
384400	386840	As I got older, even though I didn't have any use for these things, they never made
386840	387840	me organized.
387840	389820	They never, they never helped me in any way.
389820	393760	Way before they were phones, I always, I always had this fantasy, like as, as they became
393760	396840	more sophisticated, I was like, yeah, what I want to do is I want to, I want to use these
396840	402040	things like seamlessly to record every, every little bit of my life.
402040	406800	I want to like, I want to be like this, this human catalog of useless, like, like this
406800	410160	was a guy and he was here and it was, this is what he had for breakfast on any given
410160	411160	day.
411160	414680	Just be able to like go through my life and just pounce on any, any moment.
414680	419080	Like I wanted to be the Bridget Jones of, of doing nothing at all.
419080	422680	And I just ended up being the forest gump of buying little pieces of plastic shit.
422680	426680	Like I said, cause I just like every, every single one that came out, I was there for
426680	427680	Palm pilots.
427680	432880	I was there for things you guys don't remember cause you're, you're 25, but, but I, I, I,
432880	436920	then the iPhone came out and it was like, okay, this is going to be great because this
436920	438440	is now an accessory.
438440	441000	Now everyone's, everyone's, it's a cool to whip it out.
441000	442000	It's fine.
442000	446280	You don't have to bring ordinary life to a halt just to try to catalog your ordinary
446280	447320	life.
447320	451220	But then the old Henry twist on that is that all our ordinary lives became so intermingled
451220	452880	with these things that ordinary life changed.
452880	456080	You know, we know I'm not, I'm not a hipster, ludite snob about it.
456080	458800	I upgraded when we became cyborgs.
458800	465080	I, I, I, I, I lost nothing and gained a world when we, when we became Borg.
465080	466080	I prefer it.
466080	470080	I don't, I don't miss anything from the old world.
470080	473320	The only thing that I remember from the old world was a couple of people going like, why
473320	474960	is everyone on their phone all the time?
474960	477600	Like that, that's all I remember about real conversation.
477600	481000	I like that breakfast are documentaries about documenting breakfast.
481000	486640	Like I, I like, I like, I like, I like that we record everything and, but here's the thing
486640	487640	about the iPhone.
487640	493440	Like I gave something up in between the, I had a thing called a Palm trio and it was
493440	497720	like, like, it looked like a lot like what blackberries look like, like it had a little
497720	500440	thumb keyboard, the little raised keyboard.
500440	501440	There was the feedback.
501440	504840	There was the bumps that you could feel and I could really, I could type on that fucker.
504840	507080	I would write like essays at bars.
507080	508240	I would like write outlines.
508240	509640	I would get work done.
509640	512240	Not a lot, but I would, I would, I would, I would write stuff.
512240	514360	I would like, like do blog entries into the iPhone.
514360	519400	It's like that fucking, like you, no matter how hard you try, you can't get good at typing
519400	523400	on a, maybe, maybe some of the girls with like the little itty bitty tiny little thumb
523400	526720	is like, if your thumbs are like little styluses, I get teased.
526720	530600	People look over my children like, wow, you're, you're faster than my daughter at that.
530600	531600	Yeah.
531600	534760	Well, then maybe you, do you have a little, little, little sharp thumbs?
534760	541000	No, I just, I just find that I spent exactly half the time on the iPhone, like correcting
541000	542000	everything.
542000	546360	And if you turn off the auto correct, then it's just a fucking plate of spaghetti.
546360	548840	You look up and you go, who, what was I even saying?
548840	552800	When you have it on half the time, you're saying, you know, I didn't want to say nugget.
552800	558360	I wanted to say the n word, you know, I'm talking, talking to my friend.
558360	560920	Donald Glover has a really funny joke about that, but whatever.
560920	561920	Yeah.
561920	563920	I can't tell it because it involves saying the n word.
563920	568760	My phone is not smart enough to learn that I say fuck a lot more than duck.
568760	570640	It really wants me to say duck you a lot.
570640	571640	Yeah.
571640	575400	You can train them eventually, but the bottom line is like, like I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
575400	578640	saying I'll meet you at the meeting at eight.
578640	581960	That's the only thing that you can just type effortlessly on the iPhone, like stuff that's
581960	584960	like, yes, Bill, I'd love to schedule that appointment.
584960	590040	You can't, you can't just go, yo, man, give me some of that Squeeb Squab flippy flap.
590040	592440	Like you can't, you can't colloquialize.
592440	596120	You can't, you can't, that's you buying hash, right?
596120	598160	I want some Squeeb Squab.
598160	601160	Uh, anyways, so I got this giant phone.
601160	602160	It looks like a griddle.
602160	607720	Uh, it looks like a, to me it looks like what you get served a nice aperitif on, like a
607720	610480	butler comes up with that and there's a drink on top of it.
610480	617720	It's an iPhone Maxi, uh, so you can't, you can't see it in podcast land, but it, it's,
617720	622800	it's big enough that it looks like it should have a handle on it, like a, like a vanity
622800	623800	mirror.
623800	629080	Like it looks like it's, it's the, its face is the size of us of a, of an industrial spatula
629080	631160	or a big, or a big hairbrush.
631160	632160	Yeah.
632160	636680	But it's got a, so it's got a big fat keyboard for my big fat thumbs and I can thumb my little,
636680	637680	my little heart away.
637680	639760	I'm getting gaining a little accuracy.
639760	641880	I can tell that over time I'll actually get better.
641880	646040	I don't have autocorrect on, I'm just, I'm just thumbing and thumbing so you can expect
646040	651560	some wonderful things from old, uh, fuck your mama, uh, rapper coming down the blog pike
651560	663440	back a few months and years ago, that's not the farm, yo, yo, yo, yo, what did I do?
663440	666000	Zach, where was that one car?
666000	677680	Oh, here it is, here we go, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I got a real big phone.
677680	679560	It's the size of a spatula.
679560	687000	I need more hands than a tarantula if I'm going to handle the phone the size of a spatula,
687000	688000	whatever.
688000	693480	It's not, I'm still out of breath from the second rap.
693480	698600	Let's, let's, let's, let's start with a couple of raps and then we'll roll into some social
698600	703160	commentary and then, and then we'll, we'll close with a real, real, real big number.
703160	704160	Okay.
704160	705160	And you know what else I should do?
705160	709600	First thing, because I saw some of that Katy Perry, uh, documentary movie, uh, that was
709600	710600	a documentary, right?
710600	711600	That wasn't fiction.
711600	713360	I have no idea what you're talking about.
713360	718600	Uh, I, I need to do wardrobe changes at these shows.
718600	720120	She changed your clothes a lot.
720120	721120	Yeah.
721120	722120	Like Dolly Parton.
722120	723120	Yeah, exactly.
723120	726120	It's, it's, it's a fun thing for the, for the people that don't want to keep looking
726120	728800	at, you know, it's like, I should have like a little, you have a little, like a little
728800	730880	oriental, a little rack, a little screen back here.
730880	733920	Like Martin Short, you can come back and you come out as Glick or whatever the hell.
733920	736760	I mean, it's a, it's a smaller stage, so I could just get dressed in front of people.
736760	738760	I don't have to, there doesn't have to be magic about it.
738760	740320	It doesn't have to be like, how'd he do that?
740320	742280	You can go, oh, that's how he does that.
742280	744760	Like he had buttons, the shirt.
744760	745760	Yeah.
745760	746760	That's, that's what I do.
746760	747760	He buttons on another shirt.
747760	757200	You guys like finding out that you're, that I'm like you, it makes you feel more magical.
757200	759320	One plaintiff cry of protest.
759320	762200	It was my first guest, ma'am.
762200	763200	I don't know.
763320	765400	I don't have an objective view of myself.
765400	768400	I thought that people loved me because they thought I was magical.
768400	770080	It's just, it's just my first guest.
770080	771080	Your dance is magical.
771080	772080	Yeah.
772080	774600	It's tiring though.
774600	776160	So we're going to, we're going to go on tour.
776160	777160	I know you guys don't care.
777160	780240	I've already, I announced this before and it was, you get lukewarm applause because you're
780240	784000	talking to the people that you're leaving when you're going on tour, but, but we are
784000	785920	going to go all around the country.
785920	786920	It's official now.
786920	787920	Yeah.
787920	788920	I can, I can really say it.
788920	791040	We're going to, we're going to, we're going to take two weeks in January and we're just
791040	794360	going to go like mad rabid dogs.
794360	795360	There's no days off.
795360	798080	We're in a different city every night, every night.
798080	800200	And so we're not going to enjoy being in those cities.
800200	805640	No, we're going to see a hotel, a tour bus and a microphone and that's, and then a bed
805640	806840	and that's going to be it.
806840	811040	It's going to be, it's going to be gripping and we're going to visit each of the many,
811040	813000	many cities within the sound of my voice.
813000	814640	We may be coming through your town.
814640	820000	We'll announce an official schedule at some point and, and, and so, and we'll try to,
820000	823600	my original plan was, oh, then we'll tweet when we're on the road and people will go,
823600	825360	Oh, come to my little, little town.
825360	828600	All I got is a bus stop and there's only six people that know who you are, but, but you
828600	832280	know, stop at the bus stop and do a little rap about fucking their moms and stuff.
832280	834800	And like, like, like, but I don't think we're going to have time for that.
834800	838880	I think it's just going to be like, we got to get from Dallas to, to, to Schmallis, whatever
838880	839880	another city would be.
839880	840880	I don't know.
840880	841880	Schmallis.
841880	846800	I don't even know most of the States and we're going to memorize cities, but we're going
846800	848560	to go like a, just a circle.
848560	851840	We're going to draw a little story circle around America.
851840	852840	So fuck you, Iowa.
852840	856760	Cause we're not going to, you're just going to be there in the, what's in the middle?
856760	857760	Is Iowa in the middle?
857760	858760	It's yeah.
858760	859760	No.
859760	860760	All right.
860760	861760	Kansas, right?
861760	862760	Is that the no lady?
862760	868040	Did the same lady say no that the second time, the lady that tonight, I got her to say yes
868040	869040	to something.
869040	870040	Who is it?
870040	871040	Raise your hand.
871040	872040	Where's the no lady?
872040	873360	Is that Justin's mom?
873360	874360	Who is that?
874360	875360	Oh, I'm sorry.
875360	876360	Wow.
876680	877680	You're a silhouette.
877680	878680	Dan, Dan fucker.
878680	881680	Oh my God.
881680	882680	I am my friend.
882680	885080	Justin's mom is here and you're a silhouette.
885080	886480	I thought you were my friend's mom.
886480	896120	So I almost fucked you.
896120	900680	And if it hurt your feelings, it's, I, I, I, I'm, I'll still sleep tonight because you're
900680	902920	kind of yelling stuff out in the middle of the show.
902920	906240	And I was like, you've made your stance very clear on mama's.
906240	907240	Yeah.
907240	908240	I'm hard on them.
908240	914640	I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I give them, I give them what they want, like in an unapologetic
914640	920400	and unsolicited fashion, but always consensual, uh, liberal way.
920400	921400	No fake orgasms.
921400	926680	Uh, and, and yeah, and, and always, always their body, their choice afterward, whatever,
926680	929440	whatever.
929440	930440	It's very thoughtful.
930440	932080	That's very, very thoughtful.
932080	933680	That's when pro-choice becomes misogynistic.
933680	938360	I just realized that, yeah, there's a version of pro-choice that it's absolutely horrendously
938360	939360	sexist.
939360	940360	Yeah.
940360	941360	Yeah.
941360	942360	Your body, your choice.
942360	943360	Says I.
943360	944360	Over breakfast.
944360	949760	Uh, all right, anyways, enough about politics.
949760	952240	Let's talk, let's talk about race.
952240	957400	Uh, no, it's, I think, I think I, I think I'm the first show to close the book on race,
957400	958400	right?
958400	962720	I mean, I, you've, you keep opening it though, that book is frequently reopened.
962760	964000	Well, it's a magical book.
964000	968880	It flies like the, in the beginning of Spielberg's amazing stories, title sequence.
968880	969880	Wow.
969880	970880	Yeah.
970880	971880	Three people.
971880	972880	Yeah.
972880	973880	Remember that show?
973880	974880	Has anyone ever made amazing stories?
974880	975880	Woo.
975880	976880	Yeah.
976880	977880	The same little lady.
977880	978880	Yeah.
978880	979880	Someone, someone, someone.
979880	983160	I think it's amazing that even Spielberg isn't allowed to, he can't just roll into TV and
983160	987920	go, cause I said so like he's, he's constantly taken another attempt at bat.
987920	989400	Like everybody wants to do TV.
989760	994160	A TV really doesn't, I found the TV does not care about your feature credentials.
994160	995160	They just don't care.
995160	999040	And you constantly see like people who are big movie stars and movie directors and stuff.
999040	1003560	They're trying to like launch shows and a TV just goes, yeah, well, okay, fuck if no
1003560	1005040	one watches it, fuck you.
1005040	1006720	Like you can't, it's, it's pretty amazing.
1006720	1011160	It's kind of comforting to know that Spielberg has to try just as hard as you would to make
1011160	1013440	a little show about dinosaurs or something.
1013440	1014440	Let's make a prediction right now.
1014440	1018160	You've got a CBS show that you're making, you've got a Fox show you're making.
1018240	1023560	Let's, let's time capsule this predictions on the success, the livelihood, the duration
1023560	1024560	of these shows.
1024560	1029000	I would say and try to be right, like try to let's, let's, let's, let's, let's replay
1029000	1032560	this in like, you know, two years, three years, whatever.
1032560	1037000	Well I think the, I think the Fox one will, will, will get a production order for the
1037000	1040760	pilot and then it won't get picked up and it'll be like a pilot people go, but that
1040760	1041760	was good.
1041760	1045560	And they'll be like, yeah, it wasn't that good.
1045560	1050240	And then the CBS one, I think we'll, we'll, we'll, all right, serious prediction.
1050240	1051240	I'm just going to make it.
1051240	1053120	I'm not going to jinx myself.
1053120	1054440	It's going to get picked up.
1054440	1056280	Do you want to wrap it or do you want to just say it?
1056280	1058280	I'll just say it.
1058280	1059280	Okay.
1059280	1060760	It's going to get, we'll shoot a pilot.
1060760	1069720	It'll be my first multicam pilot and, and six and out, six episodes canceled.
1069720	1070880	That's my prediction.
1070880	1072760	But that's no, that's not chicken feet, man.
1072760	1073760	No.
1073760	1076520	It's like a swimming pool.
1076520	1078520	Sad.
1078520	1083160	It's a little sad.
1083160	1084680	Sad for the actors.
1084680	1085680	Yeah.
1085680	1086680	Yeah.
1086680	1089520	All those little actors, like the imagine of acting their little hearts out, I'm in
1089520	1090520	a pilot.
1090520	1092640	I better make an extra good this morning.
1092640	1093640	No, no, Toby.
1093640	1095840	I'm the fucking kiss of death, baby.
1095840	1097840	I've, I've done so many failed TV shows.
1097840	1101640	I am absolutely like just a scourge.
1101640	1104120	I've never gotten out of season one.
1104120	1105120	I've done so much.
1105120	1107200	I'm going for Clooney's records of most failed pilots.
1107200	1108200	Yeah.
1108200	1112120	By the way, we're, we're, we're taking a break from D and D this week and it's not
1112120	1114920	because Spencer was so mopey last week.
1114920	1117320	He was, he was, he was chomping at the bit.
1117320	1119320	Spencer took his own life this morning.
1119320	1122680	That episode hasn't aired yet.
1122680	1127960	We had quite an emotional episode that will be, I guess I'll be airing this coming.
1127960	1129120	It's very sad.
1129120	1130880	For those of you who are here in the, in the, in the.
1130880	1137440	He fired a 22 sided bullet through his brain.
1137440	1141600	He cast magic bullets through, through, through his head.
1141600	1144600	Spencer, are you feeling all right?
1144600	1147600	Can we get, let's get, let's get Spencer up and get a progress report.
1147600	1148600	Let's check in.
1148600	1149600	Spencer.
1149600	1160720	Yo, yo, yo, yo, Spencer for hire the man with the plan flannel shirt, even taller than
1160720	1161720	Dan.
1161720	1164320	He's got a big ass beard, like a Viking warrior.
1164320	1168120	I fucked your mama cause she's even hoerier than me.
1168120	1169120	I drank my pee.
1169120	1174640	I ate my poop and then I said, for me, I licked my lips and I did it again.
1174640	1175920	Fucked your mama five times.
1175920	1176920	Then I fucked her 10.
1176920	1177920	I fucked your mama.
1177920	1178920	Welcome Spencer.
1178920	1179920	Thanks.
1179920	1180920	I feel welcome.
1180920	1187920	Spencer, you want to, you want to try your hands from freestyle?
1187920	1190480	No, no thanks.
1190480	1206320	Maybe some day, some day, no, no, no, no, sorry guys, God damn it.
1206320	1207320	Don't break my heart.
1207320	1208320	What are these days?
1208320	1209320	What are these days?
1209320	1210320	Someday soon.
1210320	1211320	I'll train.
1211320	1212320	All right.
1212320	1216320	Maybe I'll just, I'll just kind of, just kind of leave that on in the background.
1216320	1221080	You guys know, so talk about whatever you guys are going to talk about.
1221080	1225040	My name is Spencer and I'm here to say, I'm going to roll your dice.
1225040	1227680	Give your life away.
1227680	1228680	That was me.
1228680	1229680	That was me for you listening.
1229680	1230680	Yeah.
1230680	1234520	It would be fun to do like a Super Bowl shuffle and have like Adam Goldberg like come out
1234520	1238680	and then each person raps what their name is and what, how they're valuable to Harman
1238680	1239680	town.
1239680	1242680	Do a little, a little Harman town, Harman town rap.
1242680	1244720	Spencer, are you feeling better?
1244720	1245720	You answer update.
1246080	1254280	I was feeling good until like just now I was like, I can't rap.
1254280	1255960	I didn't really fuck your mama.
1255960	1262920	No, that's fine low on the priorities list.
1262920	1269440	Well, I mean, I usually do D and D, but that's not happening.
1269440	1271720	Do you have other D and D games running?
1271720	1272720	Are you?
1272720	1273720	Not right now.
1273720	1278280	I usually kind of crash and burn because my player group is, oh, I'm totally gossiping
1278280	1279280	on the internet.
1279280	1281960	My, my player group sucks a lot.
1281960	1283640	So is it Trisha?
1283640	1284640	Yeah.
1284640	1285640	No, fuck it.
1285640	1286640	She never stops shopping.
1286640	1290480	She always wants to buy more 50 feet of rope.
1290480	1294960	Like Trisha, there's a dungeon at the ziggurat.
1294960	1298880	She's like, I don't care.
1298880	1302280	I need more burlap sacks.
1302640	1304480	I didn't know you could go shopping in D and D.
1304480	1305480	Yeah.
1305480	1307560	I mean, you guys never do it, but I mean, you totally can.
1307560	1308560	Yeah.
1308560	1311800	I build cities, but you guys don't use them.
1311800	1314760	Wait, you don't build cities.
1314760	1317240	There's always such a path and a thing.
1317240	1318800	You were in a village once or twice.
1318800	1319800	Yeah.
1319800	1320800	So we haven't, we haven't been to town.
1320800	1322040	I can have been a city kind of sense.
1322040	1323040	I wouldn't say.
1323040	1324040	I don't know.
1324040	1325040	Have we?
1325040	1326040	Yeah.
1326040	1328040	We can really, we can really go anywhere and do anything.
1328040	1329040	Yeah.
1329040	1330040	Yeah, definitely.
1330040	1331960	The eternal plane of fire.
1331960	1335800	I'm having, I'm having, I'm having trouble deciding on something because I told, I told
1335800	1339360	you last week and again, this one has a podcast yet, whatever, edit out, be talking about
1339360	1340360	that.
1340360	1341360	Cause it gets so confusing.
1341360	1347040	But I told you last week that I, you know, I've successfully sold basically, I think
1347040	1353360	I can say the word sold the idea of doing the Dungeons and Dragons games and then recording
1353360	1354360	the audio.
1354360	1357720	And then we're going to have animators do like stop motion guys, acting out the action.
1357720	1360680	And then it'll be like a thing, like like webisodes.
1360680	1367280	And my, my, my dilemma is do we stop, you know, doing D and D at Harman town and cause
1367280	1370920	if we could do a different campaign, we could keep this campaign going here and do it.
1370920	1371920	Yeah.
1371920	1372920	We'll figure it out.
1372920	1373920	Whatever.
1373920	1374920	It'll be cool.
1374920	1375920	You guys.
1375920	1380080	How many, how many people here would be fine with us not doing D and D here at Harman town?
1380080	1381080	If it was like a separate thing.
1381080	1385080	What if it was like a separate thing though, that was like, even, okay.
1385080	1386080	All right.
1386080	1387080	They're just actual hit.
1387080	1389120	You don't hear a lot of hisses these days.
1389120	1393360	That's like 1930s.
1393360	1396320	My self-esteem grew three sizes that day.
1396320	1397320	Yeah.
1397320	1398320	Yeah.
1398320	1399320	You are really, you're the, you're the, you're the thing.
1399320	1402560	Well, how many people are incredibly upset that we're not playing D and D tonight?
1402560	1403560	All right.
1403560	1404560	Well, I'll see.
1404560	1405560	You're the one.
1405560	1406560	Called your bluff.
1406560	1407560	Didn't I?
1407560	1413120	It's all, it's all fine and well to, to, to, to oppose change, but you know, when it comes
1413120	1417360	down to pick up a picket sign.
1417360	1421640	We're trying to find someone to play Lord Butcelot's father.
1421640	1422640	Right.
1422640	1423640	That's it.
1423640	1424640	See, that was my big mistake.
1424640	1425640	This is the exciting thing about the tour.
1425640	1429360	This is the, cause I, I also, I feel like we should talk more about it next week because
1429360	1433920	I got a, I contacted a filmmaker that made a very cool documentary and maybe we could
1433920	1435480	even have him as a guest next Monday.
1435480	1436480	Wait, what am I doing?
1436480	1438520	I'm making everyone feel bad for not being here next week.
1438520	1441680	Well, that sounds like a boring interview though, doesn't it?
1441680	1442680	Filmmaker.
1442680	1446400	Anyways, this is a guy, this guy did this really cool documentary and he, I, I called
1446440	1449240	him and I said, like, look, you're the first person I thought of doing this Harmontown
1449240	1450240	tour.
1450240	1453480	Like, what if you came with, what if we made this road movie and he's all excited about
1453480	1456480	it and we're going to, we're going to sit down as soon as it gets back from New York.
1456480	1462120	And, and it's going to be, my point being that the fascinating thing is it's going to
1462120	1466240	be a, it's going to be a show about a show, about a show, about not knowing how to do
1466240	1467240	a show.
1467240	1471640	Like, cause, cause what I have found out for sure, we've been doing this, these things now
1471640	1479720	for over a year and I know for certain scientific certainty that every time I try to plan something,
1479720	1480720	it sucks.
1480720	1481720	It like absolutely sucks.
1481720	1487200	And the only fun that we've ever had is, is it has been accidental and I mean, it's, it's,
1487200	1488200	it's uncanny.
1488200	1493080	I can't remember anything that we've ever decided before the show that yielded any gumdrops.
1493080	1494080	Yeah.
1494080	1496960	I mean, we decided vague things like let's play D&D, but that was all like, let's dress
1496960	1497960	as Jareth.
1497960	1502080	And I was like in the green room, like trying to memorize the, uh, the, the, the song.
1502080	1508000	And then I just come up here and I saw my baby, I don't, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
1508000	1509000	like magic.
1509000	1510000	Yeah.
1510000	1511000	I didn't.
1511000	1512000	I didn't.
1512000	1523440	So anyways, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, saw your mama yesterday, saw her today, fucked her in
1523440	1527880	the straw, fucked her in the hay, fucked her in the barn, fucked her in the house.
1527880	1530960	Fucked her with a rat, didn't fuck her with a mouse.
1530960	1531960	That was a mislead.
1531960	1532960	You saw it coming.
1532960	1541000	Fucked your mama so hard, she started humming, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.
1541000	1544000	We like the fuck.
1544000	1551800	Gotta have that fuck, uh, uh, uh, uh, Spencer.
1551800	1552800	What's up?
1552800	1553800	I want you to rap.
1553800	1556800	I want you to rap so bad.
1556800	1559000	I wish I was good.
1559000	1562800	You've heard Harman and he's amazing.
1562800	1568400	Uh, one thing that people, I saw people tweeting like, oh, you're going to take Spencer along
1568400	1569840	for the, for the tour, right?
1569840	1574240	But it kind of makes no logical sense because, and each audience would be like, we can't
1574240	1578520	serialize the, we could bring you along just to have you sit and do this.
1578520	1581760	You can just hold like a battle ax and I'm trying to help Harman town.
1581760	1584160	You know, if like it helps me to be there, it's good.
1584160	1585560	If it helps me to not be there, it's good.
1585560	1586560	I get it.
1587320	1588320	I'm not egotistical.
1588320	1593760	If you're coming on tour, Spencer, and I would love that you're fucking rapping that I could
1593760	1594760	agree to that.
1594760	1595760	All right.
1595760	1598760	We'll pay, we'll pay for all your meals and, and, and, and room and board if, if, if you
1598760	1602560	do a little rap at every, every, every, every show.
1602560	1603560	Yeah.
1603560	1604560	Yeah.
1604560	1605560	Okay.
1605560	1606560	I'll work on this.
1606560	1607560	All right.
1607560	1608560	That's what we'll do.
1608560	1609560	I wonder if there's a plan.
1609560	1610560	We made a plan.
1610560	1611960	So now it's going to, I want to get like, I would, I mean, this is really because I'm
1611960	1616320	just, and it's certainly not going to happen, but it'd be so cool if like, like I should
1616320	1617780	go from town to town.
1617780	1621400	It's like kind of like Rocky going, you know, on his little jog and there's a couple kids
1621400	1622400	following him.
1622400	1626000	By the end of the tour, there's a bunch of people on the steps jumping around and getting
1626000	1627000	strong now.
1627000	1630920	Like if people wanted to kind of follow us from, you know, little club to club around
1630920	1631920	the country and stuff like that.
1631920	1632920	Harmon heads.
1632920	1636520	You're talking about Harmon heads.
1636520	1637520	They're different from Harmonians.
1637520	1639440	It's like Trekkers and Trekkies, you know?
1639440	1640440	There's Harmon heads.
1640440	1642440	There's, there's the angle of the documentary.
1642440	1643440	Yeah.
1643440	1644440	That's the angle.
1645440	1649080	So how's your brother?
1649080	1654600	He just got his blood test results back and all he's, he's uncancerous.
1654600	1655760	So it's all done.
1655760	1656760	He's good.
1656760	1657760	Yeah.
1657760	1658760	Yeah.
1658760	1660760	It's crazy because he had like four different types.
1660760	1662040	Oh, he's going to be so glad.
1662040	1663040	I'm telling everyone this.
1663040	1666120	He had like four types of cancer at once, which is crazy.
1666120	1667120	Oh really?
1667120	1668120	I thought just one.
1668120	1671640	It was like, he had three tumors, but they represented cell types from four different.
1671640	1672640	It's crazy.
1672640	1673640	You get cancer near you.
1673640	1676880	You become like a cancer expert, but yeah, yeah.
1676880	1679840	So he got a lot of different kinds of cancer, which means he was basically like a walking
1679840	1681720	cancer factory for a while.
1681720	1683760	And I mean, he's, he's, it's, it's done.
1683760	1685440	He doesn't need chemo or anything.
1685440	1686440	He's minus a ball.
1686440	1694240	You know, he's living life and laughing easy minus a ball.
1694240	1695240	You walked over that one.
1695240	1697920	Like it was nothing.
1697920	1699240	It's a light cost considering.
1699240	1700240	Yeah.
1700240	1701240	That's true.
1701240	1702240	It's pretty common.
1702240	1705680	It's not enough for men or am I getting that statistic rock?
1705680	1706680	It's just.
1706680	1707680	No, that's for women.
1707680	1716080	Did the, did the, did the, did the doctors like say anything about, uh, did they tell
1716080	1720080	him like, first of all, is he, is he going to mind us talking about that he had testicular
1720080	1721880	cancer and had a ball removed?
1721880	1722880	I don't care.
1722880	1723880	Okay.
1723880	1725880	You, you're like me with my brother.
1725880	1726880	Yeah.
1726880	1727880	Yeah.
1727880	1728880	Let's exploit him.
1728880	1729880	Except you like your brother.
1729880	1730880	You want to, you want to hang out?
1730880	1731880	Yeah, no, he's cool, but I think he'd be fine with this.
1732000	1733000	All right.
1733000	1734000	I mean, he'd be like, they're talking about me.
1734000	1737880	So did the doctors tell him when he got his, when they were telling him like, this is what
1737880	1738880	we're going to do.
1738880	1739880	What's it called?
1739880	1740880	The testectomy.
1740880	1741880	What's, what's, what do they call that when you remove it?
1741880	1743880	I don't know what they call it.
1743880	1744880	All right.
1744880	1745880	I wasn't there.
1745880	1746880	Sorry.
1746880	1749440	Uh, the, uh, they can't call it neutering.
1749440	1750440	That's not good.
1750440	1752440	Well, that would be both of them.
1752440	1753440	Yeah.
1753440	1757600	Um, the, uh, did they tell him like, is there, is there effects on your, on your psychology?
1757600	1760640	Do you become half as half as half a douche?
1760640	1764640	Like, do you, do you, do you have more female friends because you're a better person?
1764640	1767360	Like you lose your balance a lot.
1767360	1768360	Really?
1768360	1770800	No, no.
1770800	1772760	You crave pickles.
1772760	1775440	One of your vocal hordes tightens, it gets higher voice.
1775440	1776440	I don't know.
1776440	1778960	Yeah, no, I mean, it's, you don't really need them.
1778960	1779960	Like you could cut them off.
1779960	1780960	You'd be fine.
1780960	1784080	Like you, they're, they're just, they're external.
1784080	1787560	They're like, it's not like going into a body and like pulling out the appendix and then
1787560	1788560	reattaching stuff.
1788560	1789560	So it doesn't bleed to death.
1789560	1793840	It's just like snip and then, you know, but isn't that where all, that's where all the
1793840	1794840	testosterone is made.
1794840	1798600	I mean, if you take them, if you take the whole thing off, then you would, then you're
1798600	1799600	a eunuch.
1799600	1803080	Don't you become like docile, like a, like a cat, I don't, I don't, I don't, I know nothing
1803080	1805880	about testosterone production.
1805880	1809800	Like I know nothing of testosterone production, but I mean, you can, why would you have to
1809800	1810800	both of them?
1810800	1815240	Like, I mean, you can make, you can make semen and sperm and stuff with just the one you
1815240	1816240	can.
1816800	1820800	He's been sure, he's been sure he's always been shooting the left nut.
1820800	1822440	So like, he's fine anyway.
1822440	1823440	Okay.
1823440	1824440	All right.
1824440	1828960	That's my fault.
1828960	1831720	I show the spotlight on that.
1831720	1835560	I'm reaping the whirlwind, but you want it, you want it to talk about, I mean, it's certainly
1835560	1845520	something that needs to be wrapped about, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
1845520	1846520	Do you want me to?
1846520	1847520	Yeah.
1847520	1848520	What?
1848520	1849520	Yo, yo.
1849520	1850520	No brother, Chris has one ball.
1850520	1851520	Take a step back.
1851520	1852520	You might just fall.
1852520	1853520	All right.
1853520	1854520	All right.
1854520	1855520	All right.
1855520	1856520	All right.
1856520	1865520	I mean, it's like, like, that counts.
1865520	1868080	I'll be there, you know, in the future.
1868080	1869080	All right.
1869080	1870080	There was a lot of Spencer Spencer.
1870080	1871080	Let's have a hand for Spencer.
1871080	1872080	Sorry, we didn't play D&D.
1873080	1874080	Give him a rest.
1874080	1880220	Oh, by the way, that's not why I wanted to clarify that that's not because Spencer was
1880220	1883400	lethargic last week, but that is not why there's no D&D this week.
1883400	1886680	He's not on timeout.
1886680	1891120	It's actually because it was like, like, well, this is an example of how my plans always
1891120	1892160	fall apart.
1892160	1897240	You can see if you listen to the episode like a couple of weeks ago, you can hear me crossing
1897240	1900400	that threshold towards the end of the show where I'm just too sloppy drunk.
1900400	1905800	And I kind of, like, I decide because we're going to visit my father in the D&D adventure.
1905800	1907840	I'm like, it pops in my head.
1907840	1909880	I go, I'm just going to lay all my cards on the table now.
1909880	1915040	I go, oh, Eric Eitel, let's get Eric Eitel to come to Harmon Town because Jeff's hanging
1915040	1919920	out with him and he's Adam Goldberg's buddy.
1919920	1920920	Adam has his card.
1920920	1921920	Yeah.
1921920	1922920	Adam got his card.
1922920	1923920	Eric Eitel.
1924920	1937000	Eric Eitel, former Python, gat about, foodie, what does he need a card for?
1937000	1941200	Anyways, I was thinking, like, let's get him in here, you know, even though these guys
1941200	1945440	are only 25, a nerd is a nerd, like, it's like having Led Zeppelin.
1945440	1948960	He, over a bottle of wine, he's like, oh, I'd love to come down.
1948960	1949960	I'll sing some songs.
1949960	1950960	Yeah.
1950960	1951960	Yeah.
1951960	1952960	He was going to, yeah.
1952960	1956200	He was going to come in with his guitar and just sing, like, fucking classic.
1956200	1960360	They wrote new, if there's any Python fans out there, they wrote new lyrics, updated
1960360	1965040	lyrics to the Galaxy song, the universe song, with Brian Cox, the guy who does the wonders
1965040	1969760	of the universe, that kind of cool rock and roll physicist guy, and they've written the
1969760	1970760	new Galaxy song.
1970760	1971760	It's awesome.
1971760	1972760	Yeah.
1972760	1973960	So anyways, that popped in my head.
1973960	1974960	So there I am.
1974960	1975960	You see, you can hear me.
1975960	1978880	If you rewind to that episode, you can hear me mentally planning.
1978880	1982720	As I stop the D&D game, I'm in a drunken stupor.
1982800	1984840	I'm saying to Jeff, like, yeah, let's do that.
1984840	1987000	We should have a guest cameo.
1987000	1989680	And he's like, yeah, are you thinking, I'm thinking, yeah.
1989680	1994080	So then the following week, you hear a stalling because Eric couldn't do it.
1994080	1995080	And then I think another way.
1995080	1996080	And it's like, so then this week-
1996080	1997080	He probably won't do it.
1997080	1998080	How about that?
1998080	1999080	Yeah, exactly.
1999080	2000080	I mean, he might, but he might.
2000080	2001840	And also, don't plan shit like Harmon.
2001840	2002840	Don't do it.
2002840	2003840	Like, it's stupid.
2003840	2007080	It's so dumb to try to, it's like you try to grab a butterfly.
2007080	2009760	First of all, one of two things is going to happen.
2009760	2013120	You do great, and you just crush it to death.
2013120	2015760	Or you blow it out of the way, you know, and it goes away.
2015760	2017040	Like, it's fucking butterfly.
2017040	2018320	Just let it be, you know?
2018320	2019320	Just hang on.
2019320	2020320	Thank you, ladies.
2020320	2022400	I fucked your mama.
2022400	2030640	So then this week, it was one more time, I was like, oh, I was like, because Eric goes
2030640	2032640	like, maybe, maybe not.
2032640	2037000	And then so we were like, we had a guy on standby that was going to come in, our friend
2037000	2040200	Joe Unger hangs out at the drawing room, because when you get to be my age, there's
2040200	2045720	very few men who can play your father left in Los Angeles working as performers.
2045720	2049760	So what the other guy we could think of was Joe Unger at the drawing room.
2049760	2054480	And I think that might happen, because I think he'd be a delight to have as a character.
2054480	2056720	Yeah, you will adore Joe Unger.
2056720	2060440	But at any rate, so he, then everything was like getting confused with scheduled stuff.
2060440	2062960	He had a rap party he wanted to go to, and blah, blah, blah.
2062960	2066500	So I called Spencer, and I said, let's just forget it.
2067300	2072540	The silver lining is that Spencer got up and rapped is that Spencer and I up till now have
2072540	2076100	been communicating through Twitter direct messages.
2076100	2077940	And today, two things happen.
2077940	2081100	One we fucked around with him all that much.
2081100	2090020	And also I accidentally, accidentally public tweeted a DM to my DM.
2090020	2091420	And so enough was enough.
2091420	2093100	And I just gave him my phone number.
2093100	2095340	Spencer and I have upgraded our relationship.
2096180	2096860	We are.
2099460	2102620	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
2102620	2103980	You're in my phone now.
2103980	2105740	We're at the best of buds.
2105740	2107780	I fucked your mama in the dirt and the mud.
2107780	2109700	I fucked, I fucked your salt.
2109700	2110700	I fucked your pepper.
2110700	2113380	I fucked your mama like a pig and a heifer.
2113380	2114620	Fucked her on the farm.
2114620	2115980	Fucked her in the city.
2115980	2117180	Rolled her in the dough.
2117180	2118500	Squeezed all her titties.
2120060	2121420	I drank her milk.
2121420	2122340	Fucked your mama.
2122340	2123420	Soft to silk.
2126340	2129900	OK, that one went back into misogyny.
2129900	2131900	Yeah, I don't like the rolling in the dough thing.
2131900	2134500	Well, she called her a heifer.
2134500	2136780	You kind of made her a farm animal.
2136780	2139180	You squeeze all of her titties, make sure it's going to work.
2139180	2141940	OK, I know how to make it right.
2141940	2144860	This time, I know how to make it right.
2144860	2149220	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
2149220	2150140	I fucked your daddy.
2150140	2151780	I sucked his dick.
2151780	2153780	I cradled his balls till they made me sick.
2153780	2155180	Oh shit.
2155900	2158100	The sign was over, sorry.
2158100	2158780	God damn it.
2162220	2164700	Ladies and gentlemen, there are seven people
2164700	2166580	who fucked your daddy in the world.
2166580	2168260	You are about to witness the eighth.
2171140	2175660	Yo, yo, who wants their daddy fucked tonight?
2175660	2177820	Yeah, I fucked your daddy.
2177820	2179420	I nuzzled his nuts.
2179420	2180500	I sucked his dick.
2180500	2182140	I licked his butt.
2182140	2184620	I had him over to my house for dinner.
2184620	2185460	I fucked your daddy.
2185460	2187260	I'm a daddy fucking winner.
2187260	2189820	I fucked your daddy on the roof of my house.
2189820	2190740	I fucked your daddy.
2190740	2191900	I wish I was his spouse.
2191900	2195020	But it's not legal in most of the states.
2195020	2197100	I fucked your daddy on his fine china plates.
2197100	2198940	I fucked your daddy.
2198940	2200260	I fucked him bad.
2200260	2203380	I fucked your daddy while your mom was out.
2203380	2207860	She had a great afternoon, totally rested.
2207860	2211300	She came home and watched Homeland.
2211300	2212300	I fucked your daddy.
2215500	2216540	There you go, ladies.
2219340	2222740	It's about time.
2222740	2226020	Obama won, you know?
2226020	2229140	And as rude as the treatment might have been for that daddy,
2229140	2231380	you at least were sensitive enough to nuzzle his nuts.
2236860	2239580	Spencer, we're sorry about your brother.
2239580	2241740	But sometimes you need two nuts to get nuzzled.
2244620	2246900	It's like this meditation ball.
2246900	2250620	Also, it's nice, not alliteration.
2250620	2251900	Consonants, what's the one?
2251900	2252700	Nuzzled his nuts?
2252700	2253220	It's good.
2253220	2254220	It's alliteration.
2254220	2255540	That's constant.
2255540	2258460	Tintin abulation.
2258460	2262220	All right, Vincent Price is here.
2262220	2266700	Yes, thank you for saying my favorite word, the tintin
2266700	2267180	abulation.
2269780	2274580	Wait, the woman that has booed you and has a very
2275420	2277660	tempestuous relationship.
2277660	2279700	It seems like a free radical back there.
2279700	2282300	Remember when we were in some car or something,
2282300	2284420	we were talking about what if Vincent Price did
2284420	2285700	more bridges and more songs?
2288700	2291020	Instead of just Thriller, we were doing Vincent
2291020	2297060	Price doing his talking bridges for other songs.
2297060	2298100	How's that going to work?
2298100	2300900	You can go out of a fuck your daddy rap and then have
2300900	2301500	some price.
2301500	2304460	OK, OK, we're starting from the top, though.
2305180	2307980	So this is fuck your daddy rap with Vincent Price doing
2307980	2309860	like the breakdown breakdown.
2309860	2313580	OK, we're planning now, so it's going to fall apart.
2313580	2314380	It's going to be good.
2314380	2316220	It's going to be a good.
2316220	2317540	MC daddy fucker.
2319940	2323020	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
2323020	2325500	See a lot of people in the house descended
2325500	2327660	from paternal lineage.
2327660	2331420	Well, I got news for you.
2331420	2332780	Here's what I'm going to do.
2332780	2335340	I fucked your daddy in the house in the sky.
2335340	2337380	I fucked your daddy like apple pie.
2337380	2338980	It's the American way.
2338980	2340540	Obama's new land.
2340540	2342700	I fucked your daddy in the palm of a hand
2342700	2345700	at a giant in a giant world.
2345700	2349140	I fucked your daddy like he was a girl lovingly.
2349140	2350980	I caressed his ass.
2350980	2352940	Fucked your daddy at the head of the class.
2352940	2356140	Howard Hessman was watching the thing.
2356140	2358500	I fucked your daddy till he started to sing.
2358500	2363660	Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
2363660	2369420	Darkness descends on your father's asshole.
2369420	2374340	A million penises go inside of it.
2374340	2379220	A hurricane of semen swirling in his brown rectum.
2382220	2384660	He will not love again.
2384660	2387220	I fucked your daddy on the roof of the sky.
2387220	2389780	I fucked your daddy and he didn't know why.
2389780	2392380	I fucked your daddy in both of his eyes.
2392380	2394980	I fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.
2394980	2396780	I fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.
2396780	2397780	All right.
2404780	2407300	Is there a tissue back there?
2407300	2409260	I'm crying.
2409260	2412300	I was in the fetal position on the stage at one point.
2412300	2415220	I do feel like Vincent Price can do a little better than that.
2415260	2423020	Just for future reference, he's just sort of graphic of the brown sperm and the face.
2423020	2426260	Vincent, this is not what we hired you for, Vincent.
2426260	2427580	You're supposed to wax poetic.
2427580	2431300	The whole point is that the guy from the street lays it on the line and then you come in and
2431300	2434420	give it an air of erudite.
2434420	2439060	Yeah, I think Vincent could have maybe dealt a little bit more with the fact that you fucked
2439060	2445180	someone's daddy at the palm of a giant's hand.
2445180	2446660	That's getting laid.
2446660	2447660	Yeah.
2447660	2450780	That's how you know someone has had sex with you.
2450780	2455100	They don't know you've been fucked.
2455100	2456100	Yeah.
2456100	2457660	All right.
2457660	2459660	That was fucking good.
2459660	2460660	Yeah.
2460660	2463340	We should press some vinyl, man.
2463340	2464340	Enough is enough.
2464340	2465340	Yeah.
2465340	2466340	No.
2466340	2467740	We could have go find some vinyl.
2467740	2468740	You could have a record.
2468740	2469740	Yeah.
2469740	2470740	We could have a record.
2470740	2471740	We could have a record.
2471740	2472740	We could do it.
2472740	2473740	iTunes direct.
2473740	2477540	Just fucking fucked your mama on the A side, fucked your daddy on the B side.
2477540	2480380	It's like a theme album.
2480380	2488340	Each track has a sibling track and then there's all these liner notes about street culture.
2488340	2493940	I'll hire somebody to write that.
2493940	2497940	Speaking of subcontracting, you aren't here in the green room today.
2497940	2502180	It's a little bit of an awkward experience, speaking of relationships being upgraded.
2502180	2507380	Spencer's is my choice, of course, and decided then there's Adam Goldberg who upgrades our
2507380	2510660	relationship at his discretion.
2510660	2513700	He took a new step today.
2513700	2519020	He was outside the green room and I came to the green room and I walked in and I left
2519020	2521700	the green room door open because I didn't want to close it on his face.
2521700	2526740	I was just going to the fridge and he walked in and he started pitching me a little segment
2526740	2530620	that he wants to do and he was in the green room.
2530620	2539540	What he did after a while, he said, Adam Goldberg has a segment that he wants to do.
2539540	2544620	I think that he has provided for Armand Town as much as he's taken away, perhaps.
2544620	2546260	He's provided more, certainly.
2546260	2551900	I think the benefit has outweighed the cost of having him around.
2551900	2559620	He did eventually, after he said his piece, my silence as I poured my vodka, he waited
2559620	2564740	to just before I had to say it and he kind of excused himself and left the green room.
2564740	2565740	That's good.
2565740	2566900	We should reward that behavior.
2566900	2567900	Oh.
2567900	2568900	Yeah.
2568900	2571420	That didn't go to the direction I thought it was going to go.
2571420	2572420	No, no.
2572420	2577580	He's not on the bottom of my car right now.
2577580	2583060	He's still keeping himself within certain boundaries, I think, and providing us with
2583060	2586740	a lot of pleasure and fascination and also we just don't know.
2586740	2590940	If you don't give him what he wants and then there's an incident that involves, I don't
2590940	2596660	know, a tower and a rifle, who do we have to blame but ourselves?
2596660	2598420	Who can say that we didn't see it coming?
2598420	2601700	Who can say that we don't have 16 episodes of recording sessions?
2601700	2604860	He's over there stroking his little proto beard.
2604860	2606460	All right.
2606460	2610860	Let's bring Adam Goldberg up for the Adam Goldberg segment.
2610860	2613860	That's all we'll call it.
2613860	2614860	Yo.
2614860	2615860	Yo.
2615980	2618740	Adam Goldberg here with a dick situation.
2618740	2621340	My parents have been fucked in due to strangulation.
2621340	2626140	They weren't able to speak but you know they'd have said, Dan Harmon, you're better read
2626140	2627140	than this.
2627140	2631020	Sometimes the librarian needs to squeeze and that's true in here with an internal rhyme
2631020	2632020	freeze.
2632020	2636220	Hey, this isn't the segment, I'm just being coy, Dan needs to get parents fucked on your
2636220	2637220	boy.
2637220	2638220	Yeah.
2638220	2639220	There's a press.
2639220	2640220	There's a press.
2640220	2641220	Oh.
2641220	2644340	Another situation from the nerdy boy.
2644340	2650300	He had a lot of words and he said, oh and Dan went to parents and that was sad and parents
2650300	2652780	went with Dan and all three went to bed.
2652780	2653780	Creepy.
2653780	2662820	A developmental disorder descended on your stage in a real form.
2662820	2671420	The inability to recognize social cues flocking like a hurricane of brown semen.
2671420	2672420	I'm sorry.
2672420	2673420	I'm sorry.
2673500	2674500	All right.
2674500	2675500	Stop it.
2675500	2677060	All right.
2677060	2678060	Sorry about Vincent Price.
2678060	2680100	A hurricane can flock?
2680100	2688060	Listen, Vincent Price has been dead a long time and it's not helping his mad science
2688060	2689060	dropping.
2689060	2690060	All right.
2690060	2696700	Solid, solid, solid, solid, solid, solid, back to the parent fucking well on this one.
2696700	2699860	That went parent fucking well when we went back to the parent fucking well.
2699860	2701860	You were sitting there kind of writing a little bit in your head.
2701860	2703300	You were writing a little rap in your head.
2703300	2704300	No, I wasn't.
2704300	2707740	I was trying to update this, which is, anyone here like Prairie Home Companion?
2707740	2708740	No?
2708740	2709740	Yeah.
2709740	2710740	Yes.
2710740	2711740	I didn't give you enough time to respond there.
2711740	2712740	Bad social cue on that one.
2712740	2715580	I think the answer was no.
2715580	2717500	Good because I'm going to tear the new asshole.
2717500	2718500	Oh shit.
2718500	2719500	Garrison Keeler.
2719500	2720500	You hear it?
2720500	2721500	Are you listening to this?
2721500	2722500	Yo.
2722500	2723500	Yo.
2723500	2724500	Yo.
2724500	2725500	Yo.
2725500	2726500	Yo.
2726500	2727500	Yo.
2727500	2728500	It's been a quite weekend.
2728500	2729500	Oh, sorry.
2729500	2730500	Sorry.
2730500	2731500	Sorry.
2732140	2733140	Wow.
2733140	2734140	Exactly.
2734140	2737260	I feel like you making fun of me, Jeff, is the best part of your week.
2737260	2738340	I haven't said anything.
2738340	2739340	I haven't said anything.
2739340	2740340	I know.
2740340	2741340	You're savoring it.
2741340	2742340	You're waiting.
2742340	2743340	Oh no.
2743340	2745620	I'm like a puma on a limb right now.
2745620	2746620	Ready to pounce.
2746620	2747620	Boyfect.
2747620	2748620	Boyfect.
2748620	2753980	It's been a quiet week in Lake Harmon Town, California, my hometown.
2753980	2754980	Wait.
2754980	2755980	So wait.
2755980	2756980	You're not pitching the bid.
2756980	2757980	You're actually going to do the bid.
2757980	2758980	No, I'm going to do the bids.
2758980	2759980	Oh yeah.
2759980	2760980	No, he pitched in the green room.
2760980	2764620	I was distracted by the social nervousness of like, Adam Goldberg's in the green room
2764620	2766260	and he's just pitching me something.
2766260	2767420	I didn't really hear the pitch.
2767420	2768420	So I was like, we'll bring you up.
2768420	2769700	It was a little bit of a warning.
2769700	2774140	I got to get, you know, I've been scouting out towers, you know.
2774140	2776580	Oh Jesus.
2776580	2783060	We've been smoking a lot of Squeebs Guav and just, you know.
2783060	2784060	All right.
2784060	2785860	What's the segment?
2785860	2789460	It's quite news from Lake Harmon Town.
2789460	2790460	Right.
2790620	2793620	What's the elevator pitch?
2793620	2798820	I don't think Erickson Keeler can sue me over a podcast is the elevator pitch.
2798820	2799820	Okay.
2799820	2800820	All right.
2800820	2801820	I have no idea what that means.
2801820	2802820	I'll take 10 episodes.
2802820	2803820	All right.
2803820	2804820	No.
2804820	2805820	Fuck it.
2805820	2806820	For better or for worse.
2806820	2808420	Do you want some playing music?
2808420	2810820	Do you have anything folksy?
2810820	2811820	Just folksy?
2811820	2812820	Yeah.
2812820	2813820	I think.
2813820	2814820	Yeah.
2814820	2815820	I got something.
2815820	2817100	You want like down homie kind of folksy?
2817100	2818100	Sure.
2818100	2819100	That would be spectacular.
2819100	2827580	I don't know what else we got here.
2827580	2830340	I applaud your restraint because the easy laugh would have been to just hit the hip
2830340	2832460	hop kid.
2832460	2833460	You are a craftsman.
2833460	2834460	I'm comfortable.
2834460	2835460	You're like a Chinese acrobat.
2835460	2836460	Bad at math?
2836460	2837460	What's that?
2837460	2838460	What?
2838460	2845460	That's why the Chinese acrobatics team is notoriously bad at math.
2845460	2846460	That's why they...
2846460	2847460	Oh.
2847460	2848460	It's acrobatics.
2848460	2850940	It might not be fitting for the...
2850940	2854060	I'm going to go tiki on this one, so here you are.
2854060	2855060	Nope.
2855060	2859020	Oh, no, no, no, no.
2859020	2861500	It's been a quiet week in Lake Harmontown, California.
2861500	2862500	My hometown.
2862500	2867460	Autumn has come to Lake Harmontown, dropping the thermostat to a frosty 62 degrees.
2867460	2870340	You sometimes have to wear a sweater if you go out at night, which is bothersome for the
2870340	2872140	more athletic among us.
2872140	2876740	Jeff Davis, comptroller Jeff Davis, is even considering turning on the heat at his apartment
2876740	2880780	but instead had them send over another batch of girls.
2880780	2886300	Jeff Davis, a fabulous good sport, recently won the world record for saying, I don't normally
2886300	2893540	say this to girls, but, you know, he may not have to touch that thermostat until spring.
2893540	2895740	This week is Thanksgiving, an important time for Lake Harmontown.
2895740	2896740	Is this fan fiction?
2896740	2897740	Like...
2897740	2899740	Is shit about to get slashy?
2899740	2901740	Monday Night is erotic fan...
2901740	2905060	Is this Harmon's famous slash?
2905060	2906060	It's going that way.
2906060	2907060	Yeah.
2907060	2908060	But he...
2908060	2909060	He...
2909060	2911060	It's actually Dan slash Jeff's dad.
2911060	2912060	Oh, right.
2912060	2913060	Of course.
2913060	2914060	Yeah.
2914060	2915060	Dan's...
2915060	2916060	Dan's been fucking my dad and my mom for years.
2916060	2917060	Oh, yeah.
2917060	2918060	All right.
2918060	2919060	Sorry.
2919060	2920060	Continue.
2920060	2922420	This week is Thanksgiving, an important week for Lake Harmonians, all of them who can't
2922420	2926500	afford plane tickets home or putting their $10 on the barrel, frantically Facebooking
2926500	2930060	before the show, trying to find out which dinner party to attend.
2930060	2934060	Vidora was talking to Charoo's earlier, wondering if it's worth driving to Santa Monica to avoid
2934060	2936460	having to make her own cranberry sauce.
2936460	2941060	He says it is, if she can avoid the taking the 405.
2941060	2942660	It's a time of change for Harmonians.
2942660	2946140	They're wondering if they're going to colonize the moon this year.
2946140	2950460	And if Jeff Blue will do flight refunds, everyone's planning a Christmas...
2950460	2955020	I don't have the same garrulous, joyful voice that he does, but I think this is going pretty
2955020	2956020	well.
2956020	2957020	You drink wonderfully.
2957020	2961500	Well, this much material at his pace would be like, you know...
2961500	2962500	He goes 15 minutes.
2962500	2966020	I'm going to get this under 150, minus self comments.
2966020	2971300	They're wondering if they're going to colonize the moon this year, and if Jeff Blue will
2971300	2974180	do flight refunds, if that's the case.
2974180	2977460	Everyone's planning a Christmas return to their colder states, unless it becomes really
2977460	2979900	crazy in post for Wolverine.
2979900	2982620	People are really putting their hopes up after X-Men first class.
2982620	2984500	They're saying, it did a lot right, that movie.
2984500	2987020	It did a lot right.
2987020	2989980	It's time for winter coffee here in Harmon town.
2989980	2993940	All the new flavors of coffee are in the one with mint, winter mint, peppermint, coffee
2993940	2999060	cans, and coffee meetings, which aren't officially business, or dating, or anything really.
2999060	3003820	It can be quite fun until one person or another says the word so.
3003820	3007940	Or I know why we're both here, for our offers to buy lunch.
3007940	3010180	Then there's that one on one aspect to them.
3010180	3013460	If there's three people, you can check to see if you've got any Facebook friend invites.
3013460	3016140	But with two, that's a sign of rudeness.
3016140	3019820	Coffee is a tricky thing in Harmon town, at least to drink.
3020260	3020940	Page two.
3024940	3029540	One Armenian chase was putting 20 bucks into a broke friend's gas tank in Glendale, as
3029540	3034500	one does, and got a call to meet in Studio City, got right back in his car, and drove
3034500	3038220	to meet someone for what wasn't a business meeting, but rather a guilt trip on taking
3038220	3041700	too long to get from Glendale to Studio City.
3041700	3042700	And it started to rain.
3042700	3044220	So Dan, what do you want to do later on after the show?
3044220	3046700	I'm sorry, go ahead.
3047700	3051660	And it started to rain when he was driving, the first time it rained in Los Angeles this
3051660	3052660	autumn.
3052660	3056340	When he got there, Jace was haranguing for taking so long, as it's assumed that Glendale
3056340	3061860	and Studio City are adjacent, and rain doesn't slow down LA traffic uncontrollably, or that
3061860	3065900	it can be available in zero minutes time for not even a business meeting, just an offer
3065900	3069620	to potentially maybe help a pitch for a pilot he was jerked around during.
3069620	3074060	This meeting went predictably terribly, the way we're all hoping the new Wolverine doesn't.
3074060	3076780	There's a whole lot in line for the franchise.
3076780	3080020	And it rained a lot on Lake Harmontown in general, people stood in a torrential line
3080020	3082620	Sunday for buying Squeeb Squab.
3082620	3085100	Wet but definitely worth it, but definitely wet.
3085100	3089700	And Jace was tempted to think about the squeaky windshield wiper on his car, the Goldsmobile,
3089700	3093180	but he's waiting on some money, you know, if it gets down to 50 degrees, he may need
3093180	3095380	to buy a winter jacket.
3095380	3099940	That's the news from Lake Harmontown, California, my hometown, where the men are handsome and
3099940	3101620	the women are mostly errant.
3101620	3102620	All right.
3102620	3103620	Adam Goldberg.
3103620	3104620	All right.
3104620	3105620	Yeah.
3105620	3116420	Oh, he's ripping up his, his segment.
3116420	3126060	Yeah, we got some humanity out of them back to the back to the tower.
3126060	3131180	This guy strategically up and gone like that was I wasn't gonna say anything when you left
3131180	3132180	at the beginning.
3132180	3133180	Did you get a grilled cheese?
3133180	3134180	Oh, yeah.
3134180	3135180	I hate Adam Goldberg.
3135180	3136180	You broke my heart.
3136180	3137180	I was like, where's he going?
3137180	3138180	He paid the meter in dimes.
3138180	3139180	All right.
3139180	3140180	Adam Goldberg, ladies and gentlemen.
3140180	3141180	Love him or hate him?
3141180	3142180	Or in my case, do both.
3142180	3143180	I don't hate you, Adam.
3143180	3144180	I love you.
3144180	3145180	I hate you.
3145180	3146180	I hate you.
3146180	3147180	I hate you.
3147180	3148180	I hate you.
3148180	3149180	I hate you.
3149180	3150180	I hate you.
3150180	3151180	I hate you.
3151180	3152180	I hate you.
3152180	3153180	I hate you.
3153180	3154180	I hate you.
3154180	3155180	I hate you.
3155180	3156180	I hate you.
3156180	3157180	I hate you.
3157180	3158180	I hate you.
3158180	3159180	I hate you.
3159180	3160180	I hate you.
3160180	3161180	I hate you, Adam.
3161180	3162180	I love you.
3162180	3163700	A human core landing on its edge every week.
3163700	3165940	I just don't know.
3165940	3169620	Is he the villain or am I the villain?
3169620	3175740	It's like a mirror in a mirror in a...
3175740	3176740	In a seat cucumber.
3176740	3177740	Did the no lady...
3177740	3181040	Was that commentary from the no lady?
3181040	3184620	It's all right.
3184620	3186200	Do you wanna come up here?
3186200	3187200	Okay.
3187200	3188500	No, she says.
3189500	3190500	No, she says.
3190500	3191500	It makes sense.
3191500	3192500	Yeah, yeah.
3192500	3193500	Why would she...
3193500	3195500	Why would she be called no lady?
3195500	3198500	Don't ask her yes or no questions.
3200500	3203500	How would you feel about coming up on stage right now?
3203500	3204500	No lady.
3204500	3206500	You could do a no rap.
3206500	3208500	You could rap with Vincent Price.
3208500	3210500	You could get a lot off your chest.
3210500	3212500	It sounds like you've got a lot in your mind back there.
3212500	3217500	No lady is the voice I hear in my head when I do everything.
3218500	3225500	No lady is the thing I have to overcome in order to treat good women nice.
3225500	3227500	They're always...
3227500	3231500	I'm constantly punishing women for a voice in my head that's coming from my mother or
3231500	3234500	something that's disapproving.
3234500	3238500	That's where misogyny starts is you put women on a pedestal.
3238500	3242500	You acknowledge their power over you and then...
3242500	3245500	But the women don't realize that that's where it starts or they do and they don't care
3245500	3247500	because why should you have to care?
3247500	3251500	But by the time the guy opens his mouth, he's on step three which is getting even
3251500	3254500	with you and it makes no sense.
3254500	3257500	You're just hearing this horrible thing and he's high-fiving himself and his
3257500	3259500	friends because it's like, yeah, we did it.
3259500	3261500	Today we took back the night.
3261500	3264500	It's like, no, you terrorized me.
3264500	3266500	I am a vulnerable person.
3266500	3271500	I'm capable of emotionally fulfilling you and you hate me for it.
3272500	3276500	Score some points with the ladies tonight, I think.
3276500	3278500	No.
3280500	3282500	Shut up, mom.
3286500	3287500	What are we doing?
3287500	3288500	What do we got left to talk about?
3288500	3290500	I mean, as if we had a list.
3290500	3292500	It really came up empty tonight but...
3292500	3293500	You had some good times.
3293500	3297500	I'm so reeling from the Vincent Price rap and the daddy fucking thing.
3297500	3298500	It's cool.
3298500	3299500	Yeah, it was really cool.
3299500	3302500	We've given these people a lot of shit on tonight.
3302500	3303500	You guys really...
3303500	3305500	What have we learned tonight?
3308500	3309500	God damn it.
3309500	3311500	I know there's one more thing to do.
3311500	3312500	All right.
3312500	3313500	Well, let's do...
3313500	3314500	We did this last week.
3314500	3315500	Are you having a heart attack?
3315500	3316500	I'm just perfect.
3316500	3317500	I'm just perfect.
3317500	3319500	I had hummus for lunch.
3319500	3320500	It's not charismatic.
3320500	3321500	That was terrifying.
3321500	3324500	Are you going to take your business elsewhere?
3324500	3326500	I had hummus for lunch.
3326500	3331500	Who's feeling vulnerable?
3331500	3333500	Who's feeling in transition?
3333500	3336500	Who's feeling like they need support?
3336500	3340500	Okay, we got a guy raising the back of his hand, right?
3340500	3342500	Do you want to come up here?
3342500	3344500	That's why I'm asking.
3348500	3350500	We experimented last week, which hasn't aired yet.
3350500	3354500	I read some of my journal from when I was like 15.
3354500	3359500	And it created a very strange emotional vacuum in the room.
3359500	3361500	It wasn't like the audience was having a bad time,
3361500	3364500	but it was very raw.
3364500	3366500	Not raw, like, oh, what an awesome journal.
3366500	3369500	It just made us all feel 15 again.
3369500	3372500	And then Spencer could barely roll his dice.
3372500	3374500	Everything just went a little haywire.
3374500	3375500	It went a little adolescent.
3375500	3378500	And then our friend in the audience, Jesus Diaz.
3378500	3379500	Jesus, are you here tonight?
3379500	3380500	Yes.
3380500	3381500	Okay, Jesus.
3381500	3383500	He's sitting a little further back tonight.
3383500	3384500	We did this with him.
3384500	3385500	I said, who's here?
3385500	3389500	And we realized we kind of stumbled into this Baptist revival thing.
3389500	3390500	That's what they do.
3390500	3393500	And I also found out it's not that easy.
3393500	3395500	It's like, you know, we make fun of these people,
3395500	3396500	and we call them charlatans and stuff,
3396500	3397500	but they're providing a service.
3397500	3398500	And it is kind of the same thing.
3398500	3400500	Like, you stand in front of an audience.
3400500	3402500	Everyone is like, okay, we're here for some reason.
3402500	3404500	We want to feel a certain way.
3404500	3406500	And then someone says, hoo, there's someone in the room
3406500	3407500	that's feeling something.
3407500	3409500	And like, you get excited.
3409500	3411500	If you put enough pressure on that gas pedal,
3411500	3414500	you just have a revival tent.
3414500	3419500	And people, like, thinking that they can walk again and stuff.
3419500	3422500	I went to, and I had a girlfriend that was very Christian,
3422500	3424500	and we went to Malibu to this church,
3424500	3426500	and there was a faith healer there.
3426500	3430500	And if it was a put-on, it was the best designed put-on of all time.
3430500	3432500	And if it was real, then amazing.
3432500	3435500	But like, people were getting up there, and shit was getting done.
3435500	3436500	It was really wild.
3436500	3439500	And you can't, I mean, I'm, you know,
3439500	3441500	there's a party that wants to believe that.
3441500	3443500	There's a party that wants to be, that can't believe it.
3443500	3444500	And so you're sitting there.
3444500	3447500	But in that moment, everyone in that building was like,
3447500	3449500	that guy can hear again.
3449500	3451500	Like, there was a guy that couldn't hear.
3451500	3453500	I mean, he probably could hear a little better,
3453500	3455500	or maybe he was fake or whatever, but it's like,
3455500	3457500	leave the hearing out of it.
3457500	3459500	I think everybody in this room has been.
3459500	3460500	And so, hey, what do you want?
3460500	3461500	What are you doing?
3461500	3462500	No, I'm kidding.
3462500	3466500	Meanwhile, Amanda's been on our stage for five minutes.
3466500	3467500	Right.
3467500	3469500	I didn't control that very well.
3469500	3470500	What was your name, sir?
3470500	3471500	Yeah, what's your name?
3471500	3472500	My name is Misha.
3472500	3473500	Misha.
3473500	3474500	Misha, welcome.
3474500	3475500	Welcome, Misha.
3475500	3476500	It's a terrible...
3476500	3483500	Does this emasculate you to say that is a adorable kitten's name?
3483500	3485500	It's better than a lot of what I've gotten throughout the years.
3485500	3487500	What's the worst thing you've gotten?
3487500	3490500	Misha Barton for way too long.
3490500	3491500	Misha what?
3491500	3493500	Barton from the...
3493500	3494500	OC?
3494500	3495500	Oh, okay.
3495500	3498500	I don't know how my bullies torment me.
3498500	3502500	You're young enough to have people have teased you about the OC.
3502500	3503500	Yeah, I know.
3503500	3504500	I'm telling you, man.
3504500	3507500	Enjoy it while it lasts, youngins.
3507500	3511500	Like a crisp orange leaf blowing through your daddy's dick.
3511500	3512500	Yo.
3512500	3513500	Yo.
3513500	3514500	Yo.
3514500	3515500	Yo.
3515500	3516500	I fucked your mama.
3516500	3518500	And I fucked your daddy.
3518500	3519500	Sorry.
3519500	3520500	Sorry, Misha.
3520500	3523500	Misha, what's on your plate tonight?
3523500	3524500	What brought you...
3524500	3526500	One of them has to get laid.
3526500	3527500	Yes.
3527500	3531500	What brought you up here, some spirit?
3531500	3533500	I'm in a weird transition period of my life.
3533500	3536500	I'm about to graduate from college next semester.
3536500	3541500	But I'm also 19, so I'm trying to figure out what to do with everything.
3541500	3543500	Are you some kind of prodigy?
3543500	3544500	No.
3544500	3546500	But is it 19, like way too...
3546500	3547500	It's really young.
3547500	3548500	No.
3548500	3549500	Did your parents push you?
3549500	3551500	You graduated at 16 in high school?
3551500	3552500	Graduated at 16.
3553500	3555500	It was weird.
3555500	3556500	I don't know.
3556500	3559500	I went to college when I was 16, which isn't...
3559500	3562500	The OC was on the air.
3562500	3564500	A perfect storm.
3564500	3565500	All right.
3565500	3566500	What's your field?
3566500	3569500	What's your writing for TV and film, actually?
3569500	3570500	Oh, really?
3570500	3571500	Okay.
3571500	3572500	So where do you go to school?
3572500	3573500	Emerson College.
3573500	3575500	I'm out of my depth.
3575500	3577500	I don't know anything about this circuit.
3577500	3580500	I became a writer, but I don't know anything about how you become a writer.
3580500	3582500	I don't know anything about this path.
3582500	3583500	I don't either.
3583500	3584500	All right.
3584500	3585500	All right.
3585500	3587500	So 19 graduating, you don't know what you want to do.
3587500	3588500	Is this...
3588500	3589500	This is just a...
3589500	3591500	Well, let's get this cynical thought out of our heads.
3591500	3594500	This isn't just a ploy to get me to read your screenplay.
3594500	3596500	No, I don't actually have a screenplay.
3596500	3598500	I realized in school, I wasn't good at it.
3598500	3601500	And I was like, oh, maybe this isn't the right thing for me.
3601500	3604500	So you're at the end of that road, you're going out of the world,
3604500	3607500	and now you're having second thoughts about the whole choice.
3607500	3608500	Yeah.
3608500	3609500	Is there a dual-over option?
3609500	3611500	What makes you think that you're not good at it?
3611500	3613500	I read my scripts.
3613500	3616500	Well, I...
3616500	3618500	That's not always a tell-tale sign.
3618500	3622500	Yeah, because Dan, like, you know, there was periods in our friendship
3622500	3624500	where Dan was, like, we were writing a movie,
3624500	3627500	and he would never hit print.
3627500	3628500	He would never let anybody read it.
3628500	3629500	Like, you hate everything.
3629500	3630500	You're right.
3630500	3632500	That's part of being a good writer, probably, isn't it?
3632500	3633500	Yeah, it is.
3633500	3637500	It's also part of being a bad writer, so don't go up on the roof and go,
3637500	3640500	I can fly, Dan said so.
3640500	3643500	It just doesn't eliminate any possibilities.
3643500	3645500	It's not the metric to use.
3645500	3648500	I can't tell if I'm self-aware or just really self-critical.
3648500	3651500	I mean, man learned that he could die,
3651500	3654500	and then the next thing he started doing is, you know,
3654500	3656500	burying his friends with arrowheads,
3656500	3659500	because it's like, I'm fucking up on Earth.
3659500	3663500	Like, your awareness is like self-hatred.
3663500	3666500	So anyways, that part, you can't go by that.
3667500	3668500	That's helpful.
3668500	3670500	Well, let's go to the positive side of it.
3670500	3673500	Is there something else that calls to you that you kind of,
3673500	3676500	no matter how guilty, no matter what it pays,
3676500	3678500	no matter whether there's a word for it,
3678500	3680500	is there some passion that you, like, really, like,
3680500	3682500	God, I wish I was just doing this.
3682500	3684500	Why didn't I just go in this direction?
3684500	3685500	Standup comedy.
3685500	3686500	Really?
3686500	3687500	Okay, well, then you're close enough.
3687500	3689500	Like, that's fine, yeah.
3689500	3690500	All right, do some bits.
3690500	3692500	Let's hear them.
3692500	3693500	Airplane food.
3693500	3694500	What do you got?
3694500	3699500	Do you have a tight three?
3699500	3701500	Do you have material?
3701500	3704500	I do, but this is a weird form to do it on.
3704500	3706500	Well, it's up to you.
3706500	3708500	Like, don't let them pressure you, because they don't...
3708500	3709500	You know what?
3709500	3711500	I found, you know, I traveled doing a lot of comedy.
3711500	3715500	I found a really good way to loosen up is to start off with a little rap.
3715500	3719500	Yeah, I'll open for you.
3719500	3723500	There might even be an appearance by Vincent Price.
3724500	3727500	Yo, yo.
3727500	3729500	Yo, yo.
3729500	3731500	Actually, actually, start this time from the beginning.
3731500	3734500	What we'll do is we'll do a little deaf jam kind of...
3734500	3737500	I'll be a host.
3737500	3739500	I'll be Russell Simmons.
3739500	3742500	Then I'll come out and I'll introduce a rap act.
3742500	3744500	And then I'll do a little rap.
3744500	3748500	No, lady, just stop.
3748500	3750500	It's like, at this point, you have to ask yourself,
3750500	3753500	am I at the right show?
3757500	3761500	You start to become the asshole.
3761500	3762500	I'm sorry.
3762500	3766500	Actually, Dan, no one said anything.
3766500	3770500	It's an empty chair with a mop.
3770500	3772500	It's just an old hat rack back there, Dan.
3772500	3773500	No, wait, okay.
3773500	3774500	No, you know what?
3774500	3776500	I won't open with a rap, because that would bury you.
3776500	3777500	I will...
3777500	3778500	Wow.
3778500	3779500	Wow.
3780500	3781500	I will give you...
3781500	3782500	Take that, no, lady.
3782500	3783500	I will give you the best opener in the world.
3783500	3785500	I'll do, like, shitty, horrible stand-up.
3785500	3786500	Okay, so...
3786500	3787500	All right.
3787500	3788500	Okay.
3788500	3789500	So, ladies and gentlemen,
3789500	3792500	he's open for colleges and clubs all around the country.
3792500	3793500	Schman!
3793500	3794500	Flanagan!
3794500	3796500	Oh, wow.
3796500	3798500	Boy, oh, boy.
3801500	3805500	I can't believe how much pussy's in the audience.
3805500	3807500	I'd like to eat it with a fork.
3807500	3808500	Oh!
3808500	3809500	Speaking of forks,
3809500	3811500	here's my impression of Bill Clinton
3811500	3814500	talking to a pussy with a fork.
3814500	3818500	No, I did not have relations with your pussy fork.
3818500	3820500	Oh, seriously, but what else is going on?
3820500	3822500	You know...
3824500	3827500	Black people are...
3827500	3829500	Are they bad people?
3829500	3832500	They seem like bad people.
3832500	3834500	I was walking in the grocery store.
3834500	3835500	I saw a black guy shopping.
3835500	3836500	He's like,
3836500	3838500	Whoa, shit, shit, baby.
3838500	3840500	I want some cereal.
3840500	3842500	I can't figure these people out.
3842500	3845500	It's like, you know, we should, we should, you know,
3845500	3847500	do I don't know whether to be friends with them
3847500	3851500	or round them up and put them in some kind of special camp.
3854500	3855500	I don't know.
3855500	3859500	I don't know if you guys are familiar with the United Nations,
3859500	3862500	but they have a lot of countries.
3862500	3863500	They're represented,
3863500	3865500	and I always thought it would be weird
3865500	3868500	if they were, if they were, instead of running the world,
3868500	3871500	that they were running a plumbing company,
3871500	3872500	and I think it would go, you know,
3872500	3873500	the first thing you'd see when you walk in,
3873500	3875500	you'd see Russia, you know.
3875500	3878500	Mm, oh, me, I want to plunge toilets.
3878500	3879500	Oh, comrade.
3879500	3881500	You look over there, there's China.
3881500	3883500	Oh, saw.
3883500	3886500	Oh, I need, oh, it's too much shit in my toilets.
3886500	3887500	Oh.
3887500	3889500	Oh, ho, ho, ho.
3889500	3891500	Hey, partner.
3891500	3894500	I'm the United States of America, see?
3894500	3898500	Oh, who put all this shit in the United Nations toilet?
3898500	3902500	Hey, don't look at me.
3902500	3903500	Thank you very much.
3903500	3905500	I'm spanning parking.
3905500	3906500	It's been great.
3906500	3907500	What?
3907500	3908500	What?
3908500	3909500	What did I do?
3909500	3910500	Okay, keep it going, folks.
3910500	3912500	Comedy isn't easy.
3912500	3914500	All right, let's keep it going.
3914500	3916500	Let's try to shake it off.
3916500	3918500	We got another guy coming up.
3918500	3921500	Let's keep it going for Misha.
3925500	3928500	I can't, am I supposed to rap or am I supposed to tell jokes?
3928500	3931500	No, dude, do stand up better than that guy did.
3931500	3935500	I can't wait to tell my friends that Dan Harmon opened up for me.
3940500	3942500	That's number one.
3942500	3945500	You already got a laugh.
3945500	3946500	This way.
3948500	3949500	Okay.
3949500	3951500	My name is Misha.
3951500	3953500	Misha is a Russian name.
3953500	3957500	I'm not Russian, as you guys can probably tell.
3957500	3961500	I was given my name because I was conceived during the Cold War
3961500	3964500	and my parents were pessimists.
3974500	3977500	According to statistics,
3977500	3980500	I should understand statistics.
3981500	3985500	For the podcast people listening, he's Asian.
3990500	3993500	I love the voice you do for that.
3993500	3995500	Yes, very much.
3997500	3999500	You're not that Asian.
4001500	4003500	According to white people,
4003500	4007500	I look like I want to be told I look like Jackie Chan.
4008500	4009500	Here's the thing.
4009500	4012500	I don't mind being told I look like another Asian.
4012500	4016500	What I do mind being told I look like a 57-year-old.
4021500	4023500	My father got called...
4023500	4025500	No, no, no.
4025500	4027500	This is a big triumph, but Jeff is obviously jealous
4027500	4029500	and he's sabotaging you.
4029500	4031500	That is a good milestone.
4031500	4033500	Keep going.
4033500	4035500	I'm excited.
4036500	4038500	More?
4038500	4040500	Close on the father joke.
4040500	4043500	Do I do the same one again?
4045500	4046500	I'm confused now.
4046500	4047500	Did you start with the father?
4047500	4048500	You said my father?
4048500	4050500	My father was called Jackie Chan when he was a kid.
4050500	4053500	My grandfather was called Jackie Chan when he was a kid.
4053500	4056500	That is not a good family tradition.
4057500	4059500	You know what a good family tradition though?
4059500	4061500	Wow, I can't speak English.
4062500	4064500	You know what a good family tradition though is?
4064500	4066500	Understanding statistics.
4067500	4069500	It sort of brings it around full circle.
4069500	4070500	I'm sorry.
4070500	4071500	I fucked the bit.
4071500	4072500	I fucked it out.
4072500	4073500	I'm sorry.
4073500	4074500	It's probably my fault.
4074500	4075500	Is there any other closer?
4075500	4077500	Did you get anything else up your sleeve?
4077500	4078500	Maybe a little wrap.
4078500	4080500	Okay.
4080500	4081500	What are you doing?
4081500	4082500	Shit gets hectic.
4082500	4084500	You haven't done anything yet.
4084500	4086500	This is Fantasy Island.
4086500	4088500	You don't have an old standby.
4091500	4092500	I'm sorry.
4093500	4094500	I feel terrible.
4094500	4098500	I put music cue in the middle of a bit.
4098500	4100500	I thought that was a thing and I fucked it.
4100500	4101500	He was killing.
4101500	4102500	I know he was killing.
4102500	4103500	He killed.
4103500	4104500	Let's put it that way.
4104500	4106500	Misha, ladies and gentlemen.
4109500	4111500	Get back there and rap.
4113500	4114500	Do you want to rap, Misha?
4114500	4116500	Do you think you could try a rap?
4117500	4118500	All right.
4118500	4119500	All right.
4119500	4120500	Well, no.
4120500	4121500	Not even just with a rap.
4121500	4123500	A few, just a few licks.
4123500	4124500	Just give it a whirl.
4124500	4125500	Purple licks.
4126500	4127500	Yo.
4127500	4128500	It don't feel like closure.
4128500	4129500	Yo.
4129500	4130500	Yo.
4130500	4131500	Yo.
4131500	4132500	Yo.
4132500	4133500	Yo.
4133500	4134500	People of the world.
4134500	4135500	All different colors.
4135500	4138500	We're all united in a Benetton world.
4138500	4140500	Black, white, brown, purple.
4140500	4142500	Everyone's feeling the vibe.
4142500	4144500	I'm an anti-racist rapper.
4144500	4145500	Feeling the vibe.
4145500	4149500	It's a bohemian scene on the east side.
4149500	4150500	Feeling the vibe.
4150500	4153500	Throwing it to my man, Misha.
4153500	4154500	My name is Misha.
4154500	4155500	I cannot rap.
4155500	4158500	Not much I know, but that's a fact.
4158500	4161500	When it comes to rapping, it's a skill I lack.
4161500	4164500	And that's about that, I guess.
4165500	4167500	Misha, everyone.
4168500	4170500	Everyone's a rapper.
4172500	4174500	That's what I learned tonight.
4176500	4177500	I'm going to make a prediction.
4177500	4180500	Since we made a prediction earlier, I think that Misha,
4180500	4182500	first of all, he's a good stand-up comic.
4182500	4184500	I think you're 19, right?
4184500	4185500	Yeah.
4185500	4186500	Holy shit.
4186500	4187500	Also, you're driven.
4187500	4188500	You got your shit together?
4188500	4189500	It's a little infuriating.
4189500	4190500	You could.
4190500	4191500	Also, Dan.
4191500	4194500	You could take a nap for eight years.
4194500	4201500	And get up and start doing stuff and still make half of your friends mad.
4201500	4203500	And he looks just like Jackie Chan.
4203500	4204500	He does.
4205500	4206500	It's like an uncanny.
4206500	4207500	Like a classic.
4207500	4208500	Classic Chan.
4208500	4209500	Yeah, like an early Chan.
4209500	4210500	Like an ancient Chan.
4210500	4212500	Like an ancient secret Chan.
4212500	4214500	Like Fist of the Seven Orbs.
4214500	4215500	That's not a movie.
4218500	4219500	Oh, wow.
4219500	4220500	That was good, Misha.
4220500	4221500	That was fucking awesome.
4221500	4224500	Also, I think you said that I was being jealous.
4224500	4225500	When I was, I was making a joke.
4225500	4227500	I couldn't believe the balls of someone getting up there
4227500	4229500	and doing stand-up in the middle of a show.
4229500	4230500	That's the balls of a burglar.
4230500	4233500	Well, also, the music is very sensitive to his surroundings.
4233500	4235500	He wasn't just like barreling through his thing.
4235500	4237500	And like, so he was like, well, the music's playing.
4237500	4240500	What am I, am I, do you, are you expecting something from me?
4240500	4244500	He was doing like a 70-yard hurdle dash open.
4244500	4247500	But there were like jacks on the track.
4247500	4250500	And he was like kind of acknowledging them and going, ow, ow.
4250500	4253500	OK, it's still jumping, though.
4253500	4256500	It was our fault that his, that the last bit,
4256500	4257500	that he didn't like fucking fit.
4257500	4260500	He could have finished with like a fucking backflip.
4260500	4262500	He's not Jackie Chan, Dan.
4262500	4263500	He's not actually Jackie Chan.
4263500	4265500	I'm sorry.
4265500	4267500	He looks just fucking like him.
4267500	4269500	I was lateral racist.
4269500	4275500	I was doing a stereotype of the best stand-ups are black.
4275500	4277500	And the best act ends with a backflip.
4277500	4278500	Forgot he was Asian.
4278500	4282500	That's a horrible, horrible thing to say.
4282500	4286500	We learned several weeks ago not to ask black people time travel questions.
4286500	4290500	I should never, ever suggest that an Asian man does a backflip.
4290500	4292500	Can you do a backflip, Misha?
4292500	4293500	No.
4293500	4295500	You can, can you?
4295500	4297500	You're just saying that.
4297500	4301500	You're saying, no, because we're going to make you come up here and do it.
4301500	4303500	How do people do that?
4303500	4305500	How do you not fall?
4305500	4308500	We'll figure that out in a different episode.
4308500	4309500	All right.
4309500	4311500	Let's close in a timely fashion.
4311500	4312500	It's been a nice, tight show.
4312500	4314500	I have a feeling people don't come to Hermitown because they go,
4314500	4316500	oh, the show's always two hours long.
4316500	4319500	Let's fucking blow their minds tonight and do a tight 90.
4319500	4322500	And what do we, how do we close the show?
4322500	4324500	It's almost certainly going to be a wrap, but we have to.
4324500	4328500	It feels like it has to be, but how can it possibly, you know.
4328500	4331500	Maybe, I don't know, can you take the mic around and maybe like,
4331500	4333500	does someone want to do a freestyle challenge?
4333500	4334500	Work the crowd wrap?
4334500	4335500	Yeah, work the crowd wrap.
4335500	4338500	Or does somebody out there feel that they have the chops to come up there
4338500	4339500	and do a freestyle?
4339500	4340500	Oh, a battle.
4340500	4343500	An eighth mile kind of throw down.
4343500	4344500	Anybody?
4344500	4346500	A one eighth mile.
4346500	4348500	And a special rap battle.
4348500	4349500	Anybody?
4349500	4353500	Anybody want to try their hand at taking down the grandmaster here?
4353500	4357500	No one spits this kind of fire in the whole house.
4357500	4358500	I wouldn't do it.
4358500	4360500	I already have a mic in front of my face.
4360500	4361500	All right, all right.
4361500	4362500	Well, wait.
4362500	4363500	You should rap battle me.
4363500	4364500	Huh?
4364500	4365500	Yeah.
4365500	4368500	I fucked up.
4368500	4369500	This guy.
4369500	4372500	Or did I engineer that entire thing?
4372500	4373500	Oh, shit.
4373500	4375500	Break it down.
4379500	4380500	Oh, shit.
4380500	4382500	Coming to the stage.
4382500	4385500	The clash of the titans.
4385500	4392500	Dan Harmon versus Jeff Davis.
4392500	4393500	Yo, yo.
4393500	4394500	I'll bury you.
4394500	4395500	I fucked your mama.
4395500	4398500	I fucked her like a sheep or a llama.
4398500	4402500	Went to the petting zoo, saw her ass, fed her some cashews.
4402500	4403500	Took a piece.
4403500	4404500	Yo, yo, yo.
4404500	4405500	I'm offended by some things that you said.
4406500	4408500	I think I've already told you that my mother is dead.
4408500	4411500	She died of cancer when I was just 13.
4411500	4414500	She didn't lose a ball, but it still felt me to die
4414500	4416500	of having cancer in most parts of her body.
4416500	4419500	And now you've really treated her like a hottie
4419500	4421500	that you're fucking a corpse.
4426500	4429500	Yeah, yo, yo, yo.
4429500	4430500	Yo, yo, yo.
4430500	4433500	From that, it's hard to recover.
4434500	4437500	I still fucked her even though she's dead.
4437500	4438500	How about that?
4438500	4439500	I took her body to bed.
4439500	4442500	I put her foot on the post, put her hand on the cradle.
4442500	4446500	I fucked your mama like her name was Abel.
4446500	4447500	Ferrara.
4447500	4448500	Yo, yo.
4448500	4449500	It's an actor.
4449500	4450500	Yo, yo, yo, Dan.
4450500	4452500	I'll tell you what, what I'm going to do.
4452500	4454500	I'm going to fly to Wisconsin, kill your parents,
4454500	4455500	and fuck them too.
4455500	4456500	I'm going to kill them and fuck them,
4456500	4458500	but the body is still warm.
4458500	4460500	I'm going to fuck them, and I'm going to do the swarm.
4460500	4463500	A swarm is a dance where you're coming to your mama,
4463500	4465500	and then you also call a llama.
4465500	4468500	You put a llama on your daddy, and you fuck it in the rear.
4468500	4471500	You fuck the mama's booty, and you fuck your daddy's ear.
4471500	4473500	Yo, you're talking about fucking my parents.
4473500	4474500	Yeah.
4474500	4476500	Yo, yo, that's really mean.
4476500	4477500	Yeah.
4477500	4478500	You brought up your dead mom.
4478500	4479500	That's murder.
4479500	4481500	You threw us for a loop, but I heard your Uncle Tom.
4481500	4482500	That's right.
4482500	4484500	You're a betrayer of your race.
4484500	4486500	I heard your mama was a can of mace.
4486500	4489500	She sprayed her pussy, and she sprayed her breasts.
4489500	4491500	I heard your mama couldn't pass a test.
4491500	4494500	I heard she took a number two on her own damn pencil.
4494500	4497500	Didn't understand the meaning of the stencil.
4497500	4499500	She couldn't understand even a stencil.
4499500	4500500	Stencils are easy to read.
4500500	4502500	It was a stencil.
4506500	4509500	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to Harman Town.
4512500	4514500	I think that rap battle goes to Jeff.
4516500	4517500	Thank you very much.
4517500	4519500	We've got some people to thank.
4519500	4520500	Yes, we do.

4542500	4544500	I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
4545500	4547500	There's the grilled cheese truck is out there.
4547500	4548500	I want to remind you.
4548500	4549500	Don't get your grilled cheese.
4549500	4550500	You guys are awesome tonight.
4550500	4551500	Thank you.
4551500	4552500	Dan Harmon, everybody.
4552500	4554500	Come next week.
4554500	4556500	There's a point where we're going to break for the holidays,
4556500	4559500	so there's only a couple of Harman Towns left before Eric
4559500	4561500	Eitel's not coming next week, either, you guys.
4561500	4563500	Don't miss it.
4563500	4564500	Thank you all.
4574500	4577500	Always a pleasure.
