0	12640	Where am I? Where am I? Oh my god, I'm at Harmon's now, ladies and gentlemen. I hope
12640	20320	you are too. How lucky are all of us. Make some noise. So good to see you.
21280	26520	Please welcome to the stage, the most wonderful, the incomparable, Spencer
26520	29400	Crittenden.
36160	39160	Yeah!
40840	47440	The man of the moment. King, rule, shocker, make-up, break-up. You know him as Dan
47440	54440	Harmon. Let's call him Dan Harmon, the mayor of Armandown, Dan Harmon.
57480	70600	Thank you. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. I want to thank you. I want to
70600	82720	thank you. You've been so good to me. I want to have gratitude. When I was just a
82720	93160	little boy, I couldn't thank anyone for a toy. So my rhymes were weak. But then my
93160	106440	mom took a peek down my diaper and she saw, damn, a Sherman tank.
106440	132600	Incest. Damn. Okay. Thanks. It's knowing when to take the art away, as Donald
132600	141720	Sutherland says in Six Degrees of Separation. I got one of those zits
141720	152760	right in the crease of my nose. No. What is skin thinking? How hard, I know, I
152760	156440	already know the answer. I know the answer. There's no God is the answer. It
156440	166040	is what we have. We arrived at over billions of years of improv. Otherwise
166040	169400	someone would say, you know, I think I can figure out a better way to coat a
169400	174840	gingerbread man in like latex, you know, like we wouldn't have to have
174840	181480	fucking like systems of sebum and fucking like ingrown
181480	188120	ampedumuses. Like it's seen and all topped off with, you know, there's a
188120	193800	there's all the most important part of your skin. The fact that it's covered,
193800	199000	completely covered, every square centimeter of it in microscopic flora.
199000	205560	And a little fauna. And because if it weren't there, then there's all these
205560	208560	things in the air that would land and they would go like, hmm, I'm gonna set up
208560	212280	shop here. You are protected every minute of every day by the fact that you
212280	220360	are infested by beasties that live in harmony with you. Life is a prison.
220360	224840	It's a prison cell. There's a lot of people in the cell with us. Yeah. You're
224840	228760	alive because you're a bitch.
228760	245600	You traded your integrity to see another day behind bars. You could have gone out
245600	252320	a man. I know I sound like I'm quoting a movie or something. A movie about a guy
252320	257760	who goes to prison and has to choose between dying, brave, and living
257760	265400	cowardly. Okay. It was really professorial. Yeah. I got a I got a I got a
265400	272120	new phone case. It's real big. Okay. What made it? It's just a magnet instead of the
272120	277960	thing. It's just a magnet. What what made you replace it? I'm just I got a new phone
277960	281560	and I you know I was gonna get the new case for the new phone, you know. Just
281560	289400	different size. Does that one take those 3d pictures? Yeah. The animojis. No, no.
289400	295760	I've been seeing on Facebook there's these 3d photos of dogs. So you'll be
295760	300120	scrolling through Facebook and then it'll be this 3d dog staring right at
300120	307800	you in 3d. No. And it's like well photos aren't in 3d. This is crazy and it's just
307800	314320	this big old dog staring right at you. Like coming out of the screen? Oh, coming
314320	319640	right out. Yeah, it's weird. You don't because it doesn't look like it'll work.
319640	324520	But like the parallax of the screen and the photo movement as you scroll through
324520	330240	it, it has this weird you know 3d effect to it. But I thought it was some iPhone
330240	336840	thing and maybe it's not. Hmm. I wouldn't know. Yeah. I'm not plugged in. Me neither.
337200	340840	I used to know all I used to work at Apple. I used to know all the Apple stuff.
340840	351040	Now it's like just sad. Whenever I show people my phone case they go oh it's
351040	354320	so it's like a wallet. You got your credit cards in there and stuff. I go yeah I do.
354320	358880	Cash and all that stuff. And then they always every single person they always
358880	366480	want to like this is just like some weird human instinct. They go so you
367080	370320	don't you think that's a little dangerous? Because now if you lose one
370320	375480	thing you lose everything. Will you just think about what your
375480	384320	brain is doing right now? Like you're holding vigil over a
384320	391960	society, an ideal society where we aerosol our property to the extent
391960	396080	that all of it's expendable. What are you talking about? Everyone's got like
396080	400880	four things in their pocket. Yeah. If you lose any of them you're fucked.
400880	405520	Nobody wants to lose any of them. You don't want to lose your keys, your phone,
405520	410920	or your wallet. So why the fuck? Yeah no shit if I lose one thing I'm fucked. Why
410920	415360	would you? What is that instinct that we have? Like oh yeah if you
415360	419600	think about it you're kind of fucked. Yeah. No I'm not. I'm no more fucked than
419600	423600	you. I have one thing to remember and one thing that fucks me and you have four
423600	428800	things to remember and each one fucks you a quarter. Like who cares? What is
428800	433320	this quibbling? You're a nonsense person. You should be ashamed of yourself.
433320	439200	Here's something that you lost a long time ago. Your shame. Let me
439200	444920	get you a big case for that so that when you lose it you know you should have put
444920	454680	a hubcap on that shit. It's been gone since the 70s. I would buy a shame
454680	461920	case. I don't need no shame case. Also if that were true you'd be like you
461920	464320	wouldn't put shit in your house because people would say the same shit to you
464320	468880	like now all that shit's in your house. How about your fucking skull? Who? What do you
468880	474840	cut your whole brain in one skull? What do you tie? Oh it's just just the two
474840	482640	eyeballs then so both necessary for depth perception. Yeah I've done one pancreas.
482640	489880	Whoa. Who are you? Are you an ant? Are you an insect person here to like
489880	497440	you're not very modular are you? Your identity isn't
497440	503480	sprayed in a wide enough cone for me to give you a license to be safe. What I
503480	507720	don't like about that critique is that it fundamentally relies on someone
507720	513160	essentially explaining to you what it means for things to be grouped together.
513160	518960	It's like yeah no those things are together. That's a good point. The same
518960	524720	way as if I'm wearing a watch and my arm gets cut off I'd have lost my watch.
524720	531680	Because those things are together or if my head was cut off my glasses they'd
531680	539560	also be off my body because these things are together. My head hair would also be
539560	545360	off my body being with the thing that was removed from because they're
545360	550320	together that's what that means. So I mean on the one hand it's bullying you
550320	554240	but on the other hand it's like hey what do you think it means when stuff is
554240	559960	associated with other stuff? Let me break this thing down to you. Yeah that's what
559960	565200	it really is and that's being like that's being like empathic and going
565200	568080	like well what's really happening in their brain they're they're trying to
568080	571200	connect. Right they're like I know what things are when they're next to each
571200	575160	other they're next to each other. Right. Right they're just saying something.
575160	579360	Right. That's this and it's it doesn't make me less pissed but I think I'm
579360	583640	growing because instead of just getting pissed I'm getting pissed and having the
583680	587240	thought which is anytime someone says something that pisses me off it's just
587240	591320	they had a thought and they were like oh I want to share this thought and they
591320	594560	did it and they didn't think about the ramifications of that action and how
594560	598560	much it would piss me off but they were just so excited that they said whatever
598560	602720	dumb fucking shit that they did before passing it through a filter and I'm
602720	610960	still fucking pissed but recognizing that feels like growth. I don't know and
611040	615360	that wasn't that's just free association that wasn't me trying to apply my
615360	619080	situation to yours I'm not trying to be mad at those people don't get me wrong.
619080	625160	Okay that last part was a setback. But yeah yeah sorry I was just in a trance.
625160	631400	I mean and then and then you know I I think you and I could both say then
631400	637960	also well it's these this other person who maybe they maybe they're just
638200	644000	they're they're they're little Honda generator it runs runs a little faster
644000	648120	it's got what it's got less CC's I don't I don't know what like what the metaphor
648120	652480	would be like because it doesn't do us any good to be because the reason we're
652480	658280	mad okay let me start over the reason we're mad when it happens is because
658280	668120	it's not fair because we feel anguish and anxiety and shame right or isn't
668120	670400	that isn't that why you get mad when someone cuts you off on the freeway
670400	675120	really it's not it's not like I mean some if they if they almost kill you
675120	680040	like like there's adrenaline and there's holy shit if anything usually when it's
680040	684960	a really close call you actually kind of feel a sense of elation and don't
684960	691840	remember the other person exists until a couple seconds later but it's like the
691840	696280	thing that pisses you off about the lack of consideration in it's always it
696280	701920	doesn't it isn't the root of that hair it's not fair because I put myself
701920	707640	through so much in order to not be that person and that person isn't even doing
707640	711640	it and I yeah to me I mean it sounds like the same feeling but to me it's
711640	716880	like how dare you even assume I haven't put that work in I'm putting all the
716880	720520	fucking work in you put the work in and realize I put the work in and shut the
720520	724880	fuck up because it's like I'm trying over here what are you doing yelling at
724880	730440	me for you think I'm not trying you're fucking blind shut up yeah not like
730440	737200	blind blind you can't see yeah whatever I'm it's good I live with it how are you
737200	750360	guys doing I guess there is that is it you get mad because they're they're
750360	755840	insulting you right to me it just feels like yeah I'm smart I know this stuff are
755840	758840	you gonna like it just feels like they're trying to like pretend I don't
758840	762480	know this stuff that's like yeah no fucking shit things are next to each
762480	770760	other but and maybe maybe I'm just kind of maybe are we supposed to then like
770760	777520	because I'm sure when we're talking I'm sure constantly you say something and
777520	784040	then I say something back that you knew I was gonna say and then I and that and
784040	787740	that I knew that you knew already sure that's like we're just like hitting the
787740	796140	thing but I there's categories of doing that that piss us off like I think like
796140	801500	like two zebras scientists can probably make small talk and go like oh there's a
801500	807220	new zebra in the paddock and then and then the other one says like hope this
807220	813140	one doesn't get herpes like because the zebras keep getting herpes in the paddock
813340	819700	you're not supposed to know I'm filling this in as we go it's a nonlinear it's a
819700	827420	it's a Showtime original this show the but but but kind of the guy the zebra
827420	832500	expert wanted him to say that because he's he didn't want to have to say
832500	836780	there's a new zebra in the paddock and now I'd like to talk about the last one
836780	841100	giving herpes like he doesn't want that burden he wants to be able to actually
841100	846780	just like bump the shuttlecock near the net right we have this agreement that
846780	850860	we're gonna talk about things that two people would talk about mutually not
850860	854900	not anything in the history that we can't relate on not any future dreams
854900	859020	that we we can't really jump in on we as people have this contract where we're
859020	864900	like we're friends because you know when to change the subject right the timing
864900	869060	the yeah and the person that you don't like is a person who doesn't know when
869060	872700	to change the subject that's it's like the most basic part of friendship is
872700	875460	like we're friends with the kid that your friends with some from six years
875460	878700	old on because every time you brought up paste that motherfucker was like yeah
878700	883460	you should be paid or that motherfucker was like I don't like paste and you're
883460	887260	like yeah fuck paste like that's the correct track so we get really
887260	890580	frustrated with people when it looks like they're trying to slime us or cheat
890580	894300	on the fucking contract and not putting a lot of thought into what you're gonna
894300	898980	say it's cheating on the contract and we try to do that shit right so we get
898980	902220	pissed we get insecure we're like wait a second am I being fucked am I being
902220	911580	fucked I'm being fucked you knew goddamn well you were supposed to bring up the
911580	918660	green bay Packers right I said man I sure do love Wisconsin and you looked at me
918660	926700	talking about pasta's delicious sometimes that's called an emotional bid
926700	931980	right yes I was like the first thing I learned in couples therapy emotional
931980	936220	bids which actually I have to say I hope Cody doesn't listen to this because I
936220	939980	have to cop to the fact that lately well she understands I apologize to her today
939980	944820	I've been buried in my laptop like I'm kind of hiding from some shit and like
944820	949700	I'm hiding from shit next to her and I'm using my laptop and we love each other
949700	953340	and stuff but nevertheless I have been I'm looking at the last week and I have
953340	957700	not been matching emotional bids emotional bids are just anything it's
957700	963900	the pixel of relationship communication you know we've that was the first thing
963900	969820	because it was like oh if someone says look look out the window at the st.
969820	977460	Louis arch while you're driving past st. Louis arch oh god you I hate it don't
977460	982100	make me look at stuff I hate like like like every time someone makes me look
982100	987460	at something I there's a transaction happening and I'm like I'm like it's all
987460	992820	kinds of fucking horrible shit the circuit boards that were designed to be
992820	999100	mounted in defense satellites in an era that is bygone this equipment is not
999100	1005180	needed anymore it is only hurtful and but it's like the numbers I'm crunching
1005180	1009260	it's like hey look at this thing on my phone like and I was just like like one
1009260	1012260	little part of my brain going like you just made me look at something that's
1012260	1022140	cool and no you fucking cop I'm sorry but you're not supposed to think it's
1022140	1026620	like it's an emotional bid if it's even if it seems futile somebody saying like
1026620	1030820	it's like small talky stuff for whatever this look at that look at this look at
1030820	1036660	that it's somebody checking in and saying are you with me like what's more
1036660	1041380	redundant than holding hands it's already a hand like what if anything
1041380	1049180	you're if anything you're taking two hands off the grid you're actually
1049180	1056140	you're actually downgrading half of each of your hand supply it's certainly not
1056140	1063180	practical it's definitely not edifying it doesn't like teach you new things
1063180	1070380	about your hand and yet we definitely do it we do it 85 year old people do it

1544740	1549980	I think you're just a mouthpiece for some strange Cthulhu creature who has a

1581180	1586940	Carl you know there's all there's a contemporary thought that has it that
1586940	1590500	the question itself proves it proves its own answer what the fuck are you
1590500	1601060	talking about have you been hanging out with Zander again holy shit no Zander's

1643300	1658180	do it fifth time this week I do what what what what what I thought you said
1658180	1664220	something what else is going on no I think I there's no guest tonight by the
1664220	1668700	way and Rob Schwab isn't here nothing nothing nothing nothing good is about to
1668700	1680980	happen I didn't I didn't one man five characters three of them are confused I
1680980	1684620	do I do I did write down one thing but I assume we've all been talking about this
1684620	1688540	and all of the comedic permutations have already been explored but the weird
1688540	1692140	thing is I'm off Twitter now so I never know I hear random things I feel like
1692140	1696900	one thing a week like I'm 80 years old like I know one news item a week or one
1696900	1703380	or one like it's just human interest piece and it is I can't tell the
1703380	1705820	difference between the ones that are so played out and everyone's talking about
1705820	1709500	him whatever Oh cuz Dan before when you were on Twitter you were you really had
1709500	1713580	your finger on the pulse and we were calling you the dick dick clerk of our
1713580	1717900	generation all right well I don't I don't know who you are you sound exactly
1717900	1725020	like me so let's not have a conversation why not well see that's my problem is I
1725020	1730780	I I said let's not have a conversation I don't even know which of us said that
1730780	1739700	it was me who said that this is exactly my point you and I are talking to each
1739700	1749220	other right now and no one can tell exactly it just sounds like one guy
1749220	1760500	talking because we have the same voice yep Dan Harmon meets Dan Harmon and Dan
1760500	1769060	Harmon the two so I heard one niggle it one little thing just news shit I hear
1769060	1775140	there's a tinder or the company that owns tinder they don't want all the
1775140	1784980	tinders the Hydra of all the dating swipes they were gonna or they are they
1784980	1790220	were gonna start charging people over 40 like extra is that was that a thing
1790220	1794940	that everybody was like talking about like the idea that if you're over 40 you
1794940	1801740	have to pay a little extra to be on the I just thought that was so amazing cuz
1801740	1805740	it's such a perfect it's beyond Logan's run all the way into just like because
1805740	1809060	it's like obviously the natural inversion of that is like you know and
1809060	1813700	if you're 25 obviously hey whoa it's on the house and then if you're 20 hey
1813700	1821260	here's 50 bucks and then you keep on going down all the way to the point
1821260	1826700	where if you're pregnant your baby is worth $50,000 of credit on a social
1826700	1831580	media site because it's so young you could like said you can sign a contract
1831580	1836540	for it to like committing to one over the other and then like I just like the
1836540	1842060	new Papa John as you get older than you pay if you're 90 years old you have to
1842060	1851940	pay a million dollars a minute to be around people it makes perfect sense
1851940	1857020	yeah it seems hard to parody like I was trying to think of like how to like come
1857020	1860540	up with something that was like beyond parody but seems reasonable but I feel
1860540	1865380	like there could just be like an app that like pays people to eat bugs like
1865380	1869260	you just take a picture of a cricket and they'll just give you like 30 cents and
1869260	1873340	they'll be like yeah it's sustainable blockchain it's helping everybody and
1873340	1879980	then it'll be good but I don't know can't you do that on Fiverr yeah yeah
1879980	1883620	but that's that's way you know that's a way more equitable than what I'm
1883620	1888900	proposing what's what's Fiverr Fiverr is like you can pay somebody five bucks and
1888900	1893740	above to do a task no you don't know so you can also the dollar store of task
1893740	1900940	rabbits that's I mean it's everything's a slippery slope whatever we have a
1900940	1905540	really slope is we're in the pit we're in a slippery pit whatever we have like a
1905540	1914020	really bad show I pay a 68 year old man to shit on my chest and he pays me four
1914020	1926740	dollars it's a wonderful world we've built yeah it is the very definition of
1926740	1935900	blockchain you should you should have to pay more to be around people when you're
1935900	1940860	over 40 you do you do you do pay more to do around people when you're over yes
1940860	1944940	that's what I meant you shouldn't have to that's not what I meant I meant I
1944940	1951300	meant you do you you you should have to yeah you every every interact every
1951300	1957500	gesture you make cost you three more breaths than a teenager if you say I
1957500	1963300	don't know that you your heart had to work harder but also when you go to like
1963300	1967020	New York City and you are you're you're walking through the city you see a bunch
1967020	1971620	of like 20 to 30 year olds in waitress and waiter uniforms or in bellhop
1971620	1976700	uniforms and you realize that major cities are really people over 40 with
1976700	1981540	money forcing 20-somethings to bust their ass and 20-somethings are like
1981540	1985500	well there's six of us but we live in the middle of Manhattan and we're in
1985500	1989180	that New York life and we're all like struggling to do this shit which is
1989180	1993940	unfair but then there's a bunch of like over 40 people like
1997020	2000900	suck the youth out of your lungs
2003020	2011700	it's not like San Diego that's the way we have currently in this economy not to
2011700	2015740	get crazy dark but like in this economy you should have to fucking pay because
2015740	2021060	you these kids are struggling out there like well that was I've always said that
2021060	2026220	was the you know I had an ex-girlfriend who kind of woke me up to that that
2026940	2033060	our industry Hollywood whatever you call it without sounding like a douche the
2033060	2040620	biz the razzle dazzles the business of show like it really it's got a huge
2040620	2044780	tradition of labor abuse and also at the same time the foot the thing that's
2044780	2051220	ironic about it is not only labor abuse but then also on the flip side of it it
2051220	2058300	it's you can't you the labor that gets abused has to have a support system yeah
2058300	2063940	that whole thing like you can't be you can't just be born in dirt with no
2063940	2068560	support system get on a bus and go I'm gonna go be an assistant and or whatever
2068560	2072180	and you gotta be rich to get exploited your parents have to have your back a
2072180	2076700	little bit which excludes an entire giant this whole thing and then we talk
2076700	2081460	about what where's the diversity on all the stuff but it's like at the very
2081460	2085780	bottom where we where we crack the nuts the hardest where we make people shit in
2085780	2090180	their cars and like I want to kill themselves like it's all driven by this
2090180	2095820	weird unspoken concept of yeah but this is where milk and honey flows baby like
2095820	2100940	what do you what do you mean you don't want to like like be made to cry once in
2100940	2105420	a while like what do you hate you hate you hate you hate Spielberg or something
2105500	2110540	what do you hate Jaws I thought that was a great movie right what I'm working on
2110540	2116940	the Goldbergs what do you mean that was a I riffed the name of a show that with
2116940	2120900	which I have no beef and no nobody lowered out so that it was a safe riff
2120900	2130380	just in case I need to tag that riff fuck the Goldbergs man mad beef with Jeff
2130380	2135260	Garland and then they kick you out when you get old this a rough-ass business
2135260	2139460	because they exploit you through your 20s and your 30s really and then in
2139460	2143140	your 40s you're sort of in a position where you're like I'm billing you 6,000
2143140	2149180	for that motherfucker then as you get over 40 they're like hope you got your
2149180	2160060	money in your 40s cuz it gets yeah yeah I mean I you could you could writers love
2160060	2165700	writing stories about our obsession with beauty and we tell fairy tales and
2165700	2169540	horror stories and cautionary tales about like oh you should have learned
2169540	2173900	that beauties only skin deep and all this stuff and if only I could be 50 and
2173900	2178700	look 25 but and then there's this other thing though like if you're if you you
2178700	2183780	could look 25 and factually be 50 and that would fuck you over as a
2183780	2189940	screenwriter like like people just like if you've been around too long or
2189940	2194300	someone knows that you were you're a certain age you're just you're just not
2194300	2201940	like there's there was a big suit about that with the WGA and you know the way
2201940	2208560	the suit went down you would think that we had that I my memory of it even though
2208560	2213180	I was not somebody that cared about it at the time I was very young full of
2213180	2221900	cum and pennies and and typewriter ink who's just spraying fucking cum and ink
2221900	2229100	and everywhere okay I guess I can mix so it's so somebody somebody fucking
2229100	2239260	choking on top of it I believe also the title of our four part series we enjoy
2239260	2243680	and I'll continuing for for our continuing series come and ink the Dan
2243680	2249000	Harman story after the war Winston Churchill called his boys home but Dan
2249000	2256520	Harman had more coming and more typing to do changing his identity with a
2256520	2262280	brothel owner that had his same height and dress size he began going through
2262280	2270180	three typewriters and four orchard workers a day he's insatiable appetite
2270180	2279380	for carnal knowledge and pros sharing was seconded only by his knee for more
2279380	2285700	come oh hello hair thank you what did you get here by bus it's my son
2285700	2293680	everybody is I heard you cough father so I finished let me ask you a question
2293680	2300640	son sure why do you talk so fast I'm just trying to be like you but don't you
2300640	2306680	understand in the emulation of me you're starting to become a strange uncanny
2306680	2312640	recreation no one talks the way you talk father I'm full of come
2313420	2320220	I'm full of it I'm full of it I'm full of it sold and then one of us will come
2320220	2325360	there's much to do many places to go have to say things quick so I can go and
2325360	2336780	empty this dick really of all the things I've done in my career 1940s kid full of
2336780	2343800	come was my favorite you motherfuckers just indicated a 20-year career of witty
2343800	2350640	witty witty things he sometimes applause hurts doesn't it yeah that's what I'm
2350640	2356360	saying like never ever solicit it and most of the time when you get it feel
2356360	2363760	bad it ruins everything I'm not saying you did not react organically but it is
2363760	2367740	like anything less than I mean when are we ever on the same page about what
2367740	2374900	deserves a round of applause never what is the likelihood of us agreeing like
2374900	2379500	yes of course I would applaud there but usually applause means I think it's
2379500	2385140	people going like like I'm still with you I'm listening like change the
2385140	2395000	subject they're like they're like that's a switch gears like get off your
2395000	2399200	get get off the bike and then get back on again because basically I'm you're not
2399200	2404580	a fucking triathlete so I'm not here to be wowed by your bicycling I'm I'm the
2404580	2408480	only merit you have is the weird wiggles your butt does when you're getting on
2408480	2414000	and off the bike so like it's just like like I just want to watch you go up
2414000	2420100	another driveway so I think I think the applause means like like like like good
2420100	2425020	now dude no dude no no don't get fucking bogged down in this shit I don't want to
2425020	2433440	listen to your fucking weird pontifications about the lgb2 lgbtq2
2433440	2440760	community but you applauded for skills well see she like that I got I went back
2440760	2444600	I got every letter didn't I like almost and then I added it and then I added a
2444600	2450300	two or you were on the end of that group and you were like god damn it he
2450300	2456900	doesn't say the TQ's if he doesn't hit the queers I'm right god damn it we've
2456900	2468320	been taking it forever yeah polyamory if it is look look who sister it is I got
2468320	2472960	to say she came with a much better crowd than fucking PP did y'all looking
2472960	2478200	real good all right well maybe we should maybe we should keep that energy going
2478200	2485520	let's meet a person from the ocean oh there's there's a guy from France and a
2485520	2494120	guy from Australia man Canada now dog come on back come on Canada now I just
2494120	2499960	want to make it clear I did not we did not even go down the geographic road
2499960	2504600	but I understand I don't mind you getting excited and saying like I mean
2504600	2507760	that saying he's from France could have made all the difference you never you
2507760	2511160	could tomorrow you could be like I fucking did it I did it for you
2511160	2519000	Jean-Paul I'm the reason why you were on harm in town but I I'm not being a tease
2519000	2525080	I don't want I just want to make a sensible decision sure who nobody well I
2525080	2531240	sensible decision won't involve yelling things out especially not vasectomy has
2531240	2537880	anyone has anyone traveled farther than vasectomy you had a vasectomy someone
2537880	2542880	that's here we talked about this at the top of the show bring yo a game well

2589600	2593400	pretty good judge of character oh shit like I do think is that what he says to

2793140	2796700	pretty positive when it comes to making up your own pronoun what goes it what
2796700	2805620	goes into like like for you personally if if considering like I like I
2805620	2810100	understand and don't understand like like okay non-binary but then in picking
2810100	2817740	a pronoun is it based on utility or other yeah like is it is it is it a
2817740	2820420	choice for other people or is it a choice for yourself when you pick a
2820420	2825020	pronoun you individually not the royal you you're not representing no no yeah
2825020	2829540	no I get to do mean but it's like when you go out on the street it's like it's
2829540	2834260	like it is a utility thing like how much energy am I gonna take to educate every
2834260	2839020	person that I come across and also are they gonna beat me up if I'm like right
2839260	2844460	you know you you hear my voice started dropping recently and that's pretty
2844460	2854260	exciting thing for me but yeah thank you so sometimes I'll do that and it's like
2854260	2858100	a safety thing so if I feel somebody kind of like they give you the up and
2858100	2861500	down and they clock you and and they're like all right sir come over here I'm
2861500	2869740	like yes yes I will come over there but other times if I if I look at somebody
2869740	2874740	and based off of what they're wearing or like if they're millennial ish looking
2874740	2878540	I'll go oh yeah I use they them and usually they're like oh cool cool cool
2878540	2884780	mm-hmm yeah man I thought I thought I feel I feel compelled to say like
2884780	2892900	you're right you know Nova from the podcast yeah are they here sorry I kind
2892900	2896060	of feel compelled I hope this isn't a betrayal of our cuz we talked about it
2896060	2899780	after the show but but I feel like this is something you'd want people to know
2899780	2903540	that that I you know how's like like the first time I met Nova is like I'm
2903540	2911020	immediately like oh I know I do it and then I was like she and whatever then I
2911020	2914180	did it three times a row and every time I like do the self-deprecating thing
2914180	2918300	where I'm like come on focus and stuff and then I was talking to Nova after the
2918300	2923060	show one time a couple weeks ago and another interesting conversation was
2923060	2928740	actually because no rest for the wicked it's like that's actually now like like
2928740	2936740	like Nova was like like I don't I don't want to care that much if people fuck up
2936740	2941460	I don't that that is not my choice to make a big deal out of it a preference
2941460	2946980	it's just a preference and and and at which point it occurred to me that it's
2946980	2951140	actually it's it's another thing now that I have to keep in mind is like I
2951140	2956660	kind of like take it all onto myself when I when I go like oh did I get that
2956660	2962020	right it's all about me as opposed to just like continuing to grow and take
2962020	2965980	it in stride well I mean it's like that internalized anxiety is something I feel
2965980	2971300	that every trans person has it's something like also white guilt as I'm
2971300	2981340	white so I thought you know you just why are you laughing at white guilt like
2981340	2985980	yeah can I write a monologue for you to do about how white guilt is a serious
2985980	2995300	issue let's do that next week unless you use your mayor names do you think of me
2996100	3004700	do you want to be a monologue or a poem I'm kidding haiku thank you sorry
3004700	3010140	continue we cut and then I do we have to move off this topic for just a quick
3010140	3014340	section so we can talk about some of the clothing choices oh yeah yeah yeah well
3014340	3018020	well I derailed you in the middle of a thought so I just wanted you to have a
3018020	3025100	chance to finish yeah all right now let's talk about
3025300	3033300	let's talk about these fucking shoes for just a quick if you're not yeah so if
3033300	3038620	you're at home these shoes are they are studied and they are studied very
3038620	3043860	closely together so that it creates its own sort of shell and a shell of gold
3043860	3053180	studs yeah a shell of gold studs where how what country actually it was my
3053180	3064900	cousin's wedding this last weekend where in San Diego okay whoa California
3064900	3071620	burritos that the quality of that yeah I don't know if that translated to the
3071620	3080740	podcast but I'm genuinely concerned for that person like they started to say
3080740	3094300	yeah but then something happened that's nice that's the audience I like the
3094300	3098620	vulnerable audience I like that a terrified out there they're flawed
3098620	3103220	they're flawed and they're vulnerable and they're yeah anyways San Diego
3104020	3112460	are they cool people were they cool they used to be not so cool okay but this is
3112460	3116380	like the liberal side of my family not not the side of the family that voted

3121940	3125940	they're so mad at the people that voted for over the general election it's like
3126660	3134660	when the pixies got popular and I was like fuck this shit yeah I think they

3265820	3271140	like changing one pair of old man's socks for the other like that's kind of
3271140	3275700	how they treat temporary workers but that's all also how old the English
3275700	3280220	education system is in Japan and it's not working but how much Japanese do you
3280220	3284260	have to speak to teach English in Japan
3284260	3289060	Nihongo joto hinashimasu

3301620	3307500	you're just like I said hi yeah I know there's a lot of syllables yeah like

3564580	3569940	be seeing you again which is crazy in two weeks Wow I'm so excited about the
3569940	3574660	retro gaming convention because I went to there was this thing in Portland
3574660	3581980	called XO XO I think that's what it was yeah yeah they had like a kind of a it
3581980	3587180	was just a little sliver on a different on a different thing that wasn't I the
3587180	3592140	idea of you kids like getting it all into this like retro gaming is I love it
3592140	3596500	so much because it's like it's function over form it encourages all this like
3596500	3600860	cool shit I'm genuinely into it I'm so excited to hear what you encounter there
3600860	3610180	well it's thanks everybody that's Harman town yeah with virtual gaming I think
3610180	3620500	form like the pixely form drives a lot of the what's the other one content yeah
3620660	3630900	so it's like when green appeared in in in like the vermin green appeared in
3630900	3637460	painting it drew it draw draw draw draw your fucking verb I swear you're
3637460	3642980	crushing oh don't get me started you're doing amazing also if you need to switch
3642980	3648300	between English and French Spencer can yeah that's what we'll translate yeah
3648300	3656420	cuz I know what he's gonna say before he says it we are Harry because he's
3656420	3664580	just French sir well I think I've more in common with you actually because what
3664580	3670660	drove me to listen to almond turn and then pay for the subscription to watch
3670660	3682060	you guys mercy is because I feel I share a lot of the multiple shames that
3682060	3691900	you exhibit this this man is a hero which one's which one's which one's which
3691900	3700900	one would you would you call my parfait of shames exquisite their perfection I
3700900	3717980	just want to hear it from I have tasted your shame it it is sublime in a lot of
3717980	3727740	ways you made me feel less alone that that made you feel more alone but
3727740	3732100	because it was a bunch of lonely people doing that but yeah I know I hear that a
3732100	3735900	lot and in a good way I love hearing that that's my favorite that's my
3735900	3739220	favorite thing that we always come back around to when I'm getting cranky and
3739220	3743820	going why are we doing this and all this stuff so I'm glad to hear that it's
3743820	3754300	public therapy in some way and I loved a French comic that like said this thing
3754300	3762380	unseen like I'm his man you probably never heard of it it's alright in the
3762380	3773180	1980s he once went on stage in his first one-man show and you nailed it you
3773180	3780620	nailed it and it was there like yeah I'm an exhibitionist and you're all
3780620	3785860	lawyers paying to see an exhibition that's little-minded very little-minded
3785860	3798020	yeah so there was a lot of you know this public psychotherapy and this display of
3798020	3805300	non narcissism trying to deal with it and such yeah as times are changing
3805300	3809780	they keep telling me like apparently I think what happened over the last five
3809780	3813500	years is without actually making a conscious decision because when do when
3813500	3816740	would you ever fill out a change of address form we all moved over to the
3816740	3823340	internet it we started to consider it real life and and and and now that it is
3823340	3827180	we've clearly entered an age where actually this you know what you're
3827180	3830580	describing which is the only thing that I ever thought I would be good for in
3830580	3837620	this world transparency like open like like kind of I'm never gonna do anything
3837620	3842820	that remarkable so why don't I just tell you everything I do kind of thing that's
3842820	3848500	actually it's it's become like sort of like walking out of your house with a
3848500	3851780	noose around your neck and I'm not feeling sorry for myself it's just like
3851780	3855780	I'm what I'm lamenting is the end of that culture actually being encouraged
3855780	3862900	to 25 year olds I can't imagine being 25 right now and and having the urges
3862900	3869900	that I had when I was 25 to actually like I was like it was an ironic punk
3869900	3876580	rock urge for me at 25 to go I want everyone to know everything about me
3876580	3882420	that was an ironic urge back then right as before it became fashionable yeah now
3882420	3886380	now that's like hitting yourself in the face with a hammer it's a cry for help
3886380	3891580	it's and it's it's abusable and you asked for it if you engage in that
3891580	3897580	behavior because it's you know yeah what are your feelings about this spangled
3897580	3904860	jacket forgot your name Jimmy right starts with a J ends with Jimmy Jimmy if
3904860	3908820	you're gonna forget a name forget the name Jimmy first first first name Jimmy
3908820	3915860	last name freedom oh no holy shit yes who the fuck you think he are Jimmy
3915860	3921580	freedom Jimmy freedom and literally you would turn around and be like I am
3921580	3929100	goddamn Jimmy pretty dope what you what you what you take Jimmy on the on what I
3929100	3944380	said this is an interview oh you don't have to have one sorry I thought I
3944380	3952820	interrupted Spencer hey no no you can't do that you can't you can't reprogram the
3952820	3956740	show with him as the lead I don't know I let's see where he's going all right fine
3956740	3962500	all right I'll give this five minutes but if my ratings start dipping I mean
3962500	3967580	Jimmy you probably have a very active Instagram yes okay so then you are
3967580	3973300	totally qualified to answer this question well what do you think the new
3973300	3983380	honestly I voted in the 2016 election in California and helped legalize weed in
3983460	3988980	California and we all thank you for that right and so I've been back for three
3988980	3996020	days so I'm high as fuck right oh shit oh shit it's all right do you think
3996020	3999220	there's gonna be like a new I forgot the question is there gonna be like a new
3999220	4002820	internet though like what Dan was saying is that like it used to be the internet
4002820	4006420	was a secret place where you go to hide from like the world and complain about
4006420	4010580	the world but now the internet is the world so is there any place where it's
4010580	4014660	like the internet was where we retreat from there to where it's like now safe
4014660	4018420	to complain about like I guess that's the real world now right we retreat to
4018420	4025060	the real world to complain about what's happening online well that's sad or good
4025060	4032340	it's definitely something great it's it's like when people talk to you about
4032340	4038980	I'm on stage it's cool I don't I don't know how it's like I'm on stage it's
4038980	4042500	like when people that you know on Twitter talk to you in real life about
4042500	4045700	things that they read about on Twitter and they'll like take you through the
4045700	4050660	tweet probably if you haven't seen it that's like that's strange sort of
4050660	4057180	doubling that's better than people forcing you to watch YouTube videos just
4057180	4063220	cuz it takes less time well yeah I think people are also going back to traditional
4063220	4070420	methods of communication I hate that like like letters or like you mean like
4070420	4077820	letters and words yeah like snail mail means postcards okay yeah it's hard to
4077820	4081740	say like a one objective thing you can say is we're getting to a point we're
4081740	4086460	looking at with the internet we're going okay so we all live in this cloud where
4086460	4092100	nothing is real and then but then the idea that it's not real is alternatively
4092100	4104580	weaponized and then but then idealized and it I I get really alarmed about the
4104580	4114380	idea of sliding into convicted cynicism because the bad guys like that they love
4114380	4121340	the idea that if you get in a fight with a psycho five minutes into a fight with
4121340	4126980	a psycho all you really know is that you don't even know what the fuck is
4126980	4132140	going on and it's like their specialty that's like the it's a win-win it's like
4132140	4144300	it favors a person that just wants to damage and it disadvantages actual
4144300	4149340	earnest communication because like that that's the thing that I really really
4149340	4154540	panic about is that point where we all go well nothing's real nothing's real at
4154540	4158780	all like you what did you see that on a screen well that means is that means it
4158780	4162660	either is or isn't real I would love to live in a world where it was like did
4162660	4166900	you see that on a screen that means it isn't real period but I don't think that
4166900	4172980	we could ever commit to that like we we will still we I mean we know that my
4172980	4179420	favorite Martian isn't real but we he's our favorite Martian assuming we're all
4179420	4185340	70 I just I just mean that like the entire TV industry is based on the fact
4185340	4191260	that when we see something on a screen we tend to love it we we know that share
4191260	4195380	isn't performing for us she's in a concert in Scotland but we're like wow

4203060	4206260	transfixed by the screen even though we know it's not real so the internet is
4206260	4211100	now saying like oh and we're gonna put thoughts in your head that say mankind
4211100	4220980	is evil mankind is good these universal truths are now up for sale and I I I got
4220980	4228020	too drunk late in the podcast yeah it's at this point where I become my own
4228020	4237260	guest a surprise guest so it's like as usual the the trope with this podcast is
4237260	4243380	the question it turns into a story with the narrative you figure out what the
4243380	4249220	actual question was which is just a story in it of itself yeah I don't know
4249220	4258020	yeah I mean what you said for sure Frenchy
4260020	4267260	Stacy it was two letters John Charles come on I say it my sleep I'm a fucking

4285540	4290860	they're willing to come up just because we haven't checked in
4297260	4307700	over nova superstar who's that soaring through the sky
4307700	4330820	oh so Nova the question on everyone's lips is what are you doing with the
4330820	4336660	backpack oh man I took it with me the other day was it how what's it doing for
4336660	4341660	you I don't know what to put in it but I need I finally I actually had a use
4341660	4344820	for just like a small bag put a little charger in it and my wallet and stuff
4344820	4355780	have you tried small things so the listeners may not know but Nova got a
4355780	4361260	bag from the show weeks ago yeah that was like a month oh that was that okay
4361260	4365780	now I just remember that yeah I wasn't just making I brought a tiny baby backpack
4365780	4373740	I guess that was your door prize have you ever met a Frenchman yes but it's
4373740	4378620	great to meet another it's not that nice he done huh it's not that great believe
4378620	4389780	me we are not that special just the accent listen to it all day so much more
4389780	4408980	than a Frenchman JC that's very nice of you to say so Jimmy hmm see how I'm
4408980	4413340	juggling these balls I'm like I got three guests up here I'm fucking like
4413340	4417100	I'm a pro I got everybody in the air Jimmy what are your thoughts on retro
4417100	4428020	video gaming I mean all I had to add to that is one of my friends started
4428020	4433540	playing Super Mario like on his computer and then doing the twitch stream of it
4433540	4437540	but like it was hooked up to his computer and in my experience it was
4437540	4445740	always hooked up to that clunky console to my grandma's TV in the attic when the
4445740	4453540	adults were getting drunk downstairs you know and you should stream that huh
4453540	4461740	yeah all right John Charles are you a modern gamer do you game are you playing
4461740	4469300	modern video games do you like fall out for all roads so you're romancing those
4469300	4474940	NPCs Dan red did you see I I'm not pointing at you like hey you should score
4474940	4479580	a point for me I had it I think he might be but well I did I mean look I
4479580	4490100	I went I went by my character a male ghoul yeah oh it's a cool and then you
4490100	4494940	can't stop me now I'm fucking everybody across the wasteland like I was like
4494940	4499460	taking people out like I'm like let's go shoot some things of like keep checking
4499460	4502620	in with them how you feeling did you still not romance that one guy though
4502860	4508420	not that Preston Garvey I won't I'm not I can't do it you have to commit more
4508420	4514220	because you like you have to either come in to let them go you you you you are
4514220	4518220	you saying this from a coding perspective or from or from human nature
4518220	4525500	perspective you you that I have to let Preston into my heart no from you have
4525500	4530140	to ever love them or let them go back into the pixel pool well they're gonna
4530140	4535260	love all their eyes yeah yeah love them or let them go cuz the elephant in the
4535260	4540220	wasteland with Preston Garvey is that there is a button that I clearly have
4540220	4544340	not pushed because it's lit up and it says let's keep this professional and I
4544340	4549100	keep not pressing that as much as I keep not pressing romance I keep pressing the
4549100	4555540	fucking string them along button because didn't you say it was a didn't you say
4555540	4558180	it was like uncomfortable because he was always like hey I was thinking about
4558180	4566260	committing suicide it seems wrong it seems wrong to enable like I I don't I
4566260	4572380	feel like I don't really actually think that the end of the game would be
4572380	4576780	freshwater restored to the Commonwealth and then I'm like walking with my dog
4576780	4583500	and and then there's a pause and then you hear a distant gunshot that would be
4583500	4589700	good that'd be really good and then and then the game says every choice matters
4589700	4596020	you kept enabling him he told you he wanted to kill himself and instead of
4596020	4602500	talking to other people you told him good job he said he didn't want to anymore
4602500	4609140	he said he didn't want to anymore right but he always says that you know he
4609140	4612780	keeps saying that but he also keeps bringing it up so I need I need I need
4612780	4617100	everybody whoever has that thought entering their head to tell anybody that
4617100	4620740	they possibly feel comfortable telling it to him being absolutely unashamed of
4620740	4626220	it I do not want my relationships to start that way I think that's dangerous
4626220	4630700	it's unhealthy not dangerous maybe dangerous is too punitive it's unhealthy
4630700	4637300	it's not the right time to look up if you're if you're like yeah I just
4637300	4640900	finished battling the cosmos I think I'm not even sure if I should be
4640900	4645900	breathing or not and no but anyways what's your birthstone like no you're
4645900	4650460	not ready to maybe if you say flirt then maybe he'll be like well I've just been
4650460	4653620	having these dark thoughts so let's take it slow and then you'll be like okay
4653620	4657300	cool you know who knows but the relationship would forever no matter what
4657300	4660500	his behavior would would be the relationship would be forever tainted by
4660500	4664980	this idea that the coupling point was was that which me which would imply to
4664980	4669940	me logically that if we ever broke it off that he would be returning to the
4669940	4674900	state that I met him in which was suicidal you're right I before I met you
4674900	4680620	I was thinking committing suicide I was like well get over that yeah and love
4680620	4685300	every love yourself and then all this stuff and then let's let's both fuck
4685300	4688820	around and make huge mistakes lately like because neither of us are perfect
4688820	4693340	and the goal of relationships isn't perfection however definitely if someone's
4693340	4698100	like a coupling point is like the reason we should fuck right now is
4698100	4704260	because I was about to kill myself that that I think those tines need to have
4704260	4709940	little scotch tape Best Buy things put on them works for me
4710660	4715500	can't tell you how many Jimmy you look Jimmy I saw a look in your eye like you
4715500	4720580	you're like I can talk about this yeah well it was just like you're talking
4720820	4726300	listen you're saying no you're I'm dr. J you just took away my chief move sorry
4726300	4732860	go ahead no no no I was I thought it did finish I was not letting you finish was
4732860	4738700	my thing well the way if you say that every relationship it's not about
4738700	4747220	perfection but then you're also talking about like the perfect it like the
4747220	4751940	relationships path is predetermined so you're like you're saying well I'm not
4751940	4756140	gonna go into it if it's not perfect you know oh no no no I didn't mean to apply
4756140	4762740	that I it's hard it's hard to talk about there's no shared vocabulary with it
4762740	4768940	what I was saying is in the kind of like these sort of like all I can picture it
4768940	4775820	is this is a like sort of space modular like space station blocks and like they
4775820	4780780	have like coupling points on them right like so this thing's got a tab and this
4780780	4785380	thing's got a slot or this thing's got a thing and it's like like the way that we
4785380	4788500	meet each other and the the things that we say over coffee and the things that
4788500	4792820	we say over the moments leading up to us actually maybe physically consummating
4792820	4798020	a relationship and then the all of these things like that the flux that is
4798020	4805100	welding us together all I'm saying is if if as in the end of speed did you ever
4805100	4811340	see speed with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock they they make sure everyone
4811340	4815700	knows throughout that movie this relationship is not going to work why
4815700	4822420	because it's based on speed yeah it's a nice refreshing thing about that action
4822420	4826940	movie they at least they say if there's a speed to one of us isn't coming back
4826940	4831580	and they both know it during speed because they're like did you know that
4831580	4837420	I think because the way they say it is like relationships built during trauma
4837420	4848780	are not going to last what is this oh no I'm on I'm on the stage just smart
4848780	4870260	watch like let's say you and I go into a liquor store together and we go let's
4870260	4875940	let's get a lottery ticket and there we go oh shit I only have 50 cents what do
4875940	4880220	you have I only have 50 cents lottery tickets one dollar so we say let's split
4880220	4885380	a lottery ticket we're gonna and we make the obvious choice whatever we win
4885380	4891580	we'll split it right so we we barely know each other or we know each other
4891580	4896180	five years I don't know but well I should know because I'm narrating this
4896180	4900780	parable we've known each other six months we've known each other six months
4900780	4908340	you're you're you're a botany intern and I'm working on a new kind of dandelion
4908340	4914260	yeah I love I love plants and we both needed cigarettes we both smoke and we
4914260	4918300	went out so so now we've ended up going half these on a lottery ticket and we
4918300	4921980	both put two quarters on the countertop the guy takes him it gives us a scratch
4921980	4927220	off we scratch it off holy shit five million dollars jackpot we scratch it
4927220	4935260	off so now you and I say oh my god holy shit we just won the lottery together
4935260	4940940	here's the things that are reasonable to say we're both going to get half of a
4940940	4947580	lottery jackpot this is a great day we're doing awesome here's some things
4947580	4954620	that are awful to say in that moment let's get married you're my best friend
4955260	4960100	like as harmless as that may seem if it's based on that moment it's you're
4960100	4964860	building it on this thing that's not real that that's what I was saying about
4964860	4970740	the suicidality kind of thing or it's like Jesus Christ I Jimmy I mean god
4970740	4976620	bless you too high for this right now no I'm following I'm tracking damn do you
4976620	4986540	know each other oh no just you have that much empathy yeah yeah you high oh
4986540	4996580	yeah oh you said that earlier me too me too oh oh no we should probably yeah we
4996580	5004380	should probably stop doing the show what no we got we got a little time Jeff
5004380	5008900	Davis would kill me we have so many questions look at this but United
5008900	5012780	Nations we have before us okay we got a lot of things we could do so we could

5034460	5040820	if he just actually just spoke French for the bridge you know or whatever like
5040820	5044300	I just throw it to him and he just kind of you could just say French stuff we can
5044300	5049100	say Serge Gainsburg for the hook and he'll know how to do that shit
5049100	5057780	Serge Gainsburg is the shit Serge Gainsburg oh shit he's like the French

5065740	5074460	the series madmen no this is okay to those who know madmen there's they make
5074460	5079820	an ad for the coffee Martinson and the jingle for this ad in the series is
5079820	5087060	actually the melody of Serge Gainsburg cowboy cooler cafe cooler cafe cafe
5087060	5098300	well you can do that for sure also not to trivialize your entire country but
5098300	5103980	you could also just speak anything you could just say it's all the same you
5103980	5110900	could just recite the ingredients to a meringue and over because I think what

5545220	5553140	at the park in Silver Lake in Los Feliz exactly and um to my shame I think this interest stems
5553380	5555540	from the sitcom full house
5559460	5562340	of course of kung fu house yeah
5566660	5575300	for the folks at home for the folks at home what's kung fu house I mean we all know well kung fu
5575300	5585060	house is about this you know um washington said sensei perfected uh his own brand of obviously
5585060	5592340	kung fu and uh finds his himself with his two son and his daughter without uh someone to care for
5592340	5608420	for his dojo so and thus he finds a new wife but um she also has two daughters and a son and uh this
5610420	5617300	how do you know marry both um very different because what I didn't tell you of course I
5617300	5624100	forgot is the brainy much kung fu house no okay I'm just double checking it's it's full house
5624100	5630980	and I was just riffing of the oh oh all right yeah well fuck this
5634260	5638500	it's full it's full house he was saying full house and I heard kung fu I did too
5638500	5644820	and so he was I knew he was I knew he was making up kung fu house but what I didn't realize is
5644820	5650900	that he was in order to make a makeup kung fu house he was stripping down the chassis of full house
5652180	5658980	and adding kung fu fenders I am not a very good advisor my uh my years as a
5660340	5667140	game master didn't very much improve uh my faculties to improve improvise on this stuff

5792020	5800660	I'm swapping out the phonemes the their their eye is an oi and their a is an a
5800660	5807300	it's spelling and and so on so resulting in the following phrase that I used to warm up
5807780	5810900	for a show in Australia
5812260	5815300	oi oi loik that hit mate
5819380	5820660	oh shit
5821540	5826020	Said man oh man oi loik that hit mate
5828100	5833380	it's genuinely a true Australian accent the only problem is no Australian talks like that
5833380	5839740	because we're very good curious laid-back people like no I like that
5839740	5848060	hat might it's perfect it's the same it's the same sound the truth is I'm
5848060	5853200	nailing the act yeah I agree any accent specialist would tell you he's nailing
5853200	5861020	the accent the problem is no one talks like that because to hot man no one's
5861020	5866060	ever going through the physical conditions necessary to make you talk
5866060	5877300	like that however I am nailing the accent I'm gonna try it with a different
5877300	5896380	phrase I'd like I'd like I'd like I'm so sorry I we have people over all the
5896380	5901740	time he's normally super polite to them I know he's been doing he's been doing
5901740	5911220	this for an hour and a half and I'm so sorry let's first find out all right
5911220	5920340	god damn it all right first we're gonna find out who is shake so that when he
5920340	5934620	punches you in the land oh boy like a bag of fries oh now the booth so let's
5934620	5939900	get a tell us who you are and what brings your armor towns my name is
5939900	5944420	Jordan and I'm here because I've been listening to the podcast for a few years
5944420	5950140	it's crazy I'm sitting on the stage thanks guys like this see like me
5951140	5957380	don't mind yeah but there you go thank you so much yeah come see after a long
5957380	5962180	time listening sir are you like every Australian I've ever met and I say this
5962180	5967980	in the most complimentary sense are you and I'm not gonna use the phrase I see
5967980	5973980	next question but are you are you back packing across the country no I'm
5973980	5991460	actually using airplanes oh yeah oh damn I figured them out can I well can I
5991460	5994380	say what are you are you yeah what are you all right well go ahead say the
5994380	5998260	first most shocking deep thing I've noticed difference between Australia and
5998260	6003620	America is the volume of water in your fucking toilet bowls oh yeah how much
6003620	6011860	water do you need the splashback man I need all of that I'm busy later come on
6011860	6017220	how many toilet how many American toilets have you met you will fight yeah
6017220	6026420	yeah do more of that we like that no I when we went to Australia I was like
6026420	6035180	how do they like the toilets they're more vertical so I think they get more
6035180	6041260	speed dropping down to blast them back through the pipe I don't know how they
6041260	6046620	got his physics it's crazy I think you're right yeah I think yeah it's
6046620	6052260	because our our toilets have gravity working on their sides of course your
6052260	6056820	toilets are working against gravity because they're on the bottom of the
6056820	6061420	earth we have to run away from whatever we deliver so the turd is like having to
6061420	6068020	be pulled up like like the core of the earth is sucking the turd up through
6068020	6071940	Australia like a like one of those Japanese drinks but what's it called a
6071940	6081420	Bobi Bobo Boba Boba what Boba Boba yeah yeah yeah Boba tea yeah Boba like a
6081420	6089900	Boba that's why I'm very glad to be here it makes a lot of mess I work in a
6089900	6101580	hospital just working on computer stuff yeah yeah I can get you tiling oil in a
6101580	6107180	band-aid shit that's my clearance that's what I what are you doing here I
