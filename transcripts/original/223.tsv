0	7600	From Hollywood, California, it is my pleasure and duty to announce that Heart of Town is
7600	16600	once again in session.
16600	18520	Spencer Crittenden to the stage.
18520	19520	Spencer.
19520	26520	How's it going, buddy?
26520	29520	I'm bad.
29520	38520	Alright, well let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, shall we, Mr. Dan Harman?
38520	39520	Hello.
39520	41520	Thank you.
41520	47000	Thank you very much.
47000	48680	So you came here from LAX.
48680	49680	I came here from LAX.
49680	51040	But where were you?
51040	52040	I was in Las Vegas.
52040	53720	What was going down in Las Vegas?
53720	54720	Chris McKenna's birthday.
54720	55720	Oh shit.
55720	62240	I'm an awful, awful gambler, which is good because that means I never will develop a
62240	63240	problem.
63240	67360	I'm so bad at it that it's never fun.
67360	75240	I just do that thing that, oh I've lost three times in a row so I'll bet six times as much
75240	80400	and then I'll break even and I just keep doing that until $1,000 goes, which is five
80400	84160	minutes later and then I go get another $1,000 and then the ATM says, you can't do that and
84160	87520	I go, okay, I'm done gambling.
87520	89400	What's your game?
89400	90640	I like Blackjack the most.
90640	95320	If I can control myself, as you know, you can sit there like Blackjack.
95320	98840	What you should do is just fucking follow the rules and then you're just drinking for
98840	102920	free sitting at a table with some friends for possibly hours and hours and you're up
102920	104960	and you're down and you're up and you're down.
105280	109840	If you say in your head, okay, I'm going to lose $500 maybe, let's say, but the thing
109840	113880	is, this was the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it was like $25 minimum tables.
113880	117160	I was just like, $25, that's half of a video game.
117160	121240	I've heard from people there that that's not a great place to gamble.
121240	126040	Nobody has ever had a good story of gambling and winning and having fun there.
126040	127040	You have?
127040	128040	Yeah.
128040	129040	You enjoy the Cosmopolitan?
129040	135080	I went and got $25 on the free card and I spent it and I won $100.
135080	136080	Dang.
136080	150560	Well, not to be outdone, I also won $25 because I got a triple bazinga on the Big Bang Theory
150560	153160	machine.
153160	156600	Three bazingas should be more than $25.
156640	159600	I don't even watch that show and I know a bazinga is important.
163600	165600	You got three bazingas and all you got was $25?
165600	166600	Yeah.
166600	167600	What was your coin?
167600	170600	I guess the guys that write the slap machine get home by $5, too.
173600	174600	Now, still better.
174600	175600	Why were you playing this?
175600	177600	You were playing it ironically, I assume?
177600	181600	Well, yeah, I guess I kind of thought it would be hilarious if I could hit like a huge jackpot
181600	186200	on the Big Bang Theory machine, but I also thought it would be funny if I lost $1,000.
187200	191200	In either case, I was going to, you know, I knew I was going to tweet Bill Prady, my friend
191200	195200	who runs, who I think is still running it, and, you know, I don't know.
195200	199200	It's fun to have friends that are so much, you know, they're so successful that you can
199200	201200	kind of like, you can kind of openly hate them.
201200	204200	Like, just go like, hey, Big Bang Theory, suck my dick.
204200	205200	You guys suck.
205200	208200	And it's like, we don't care, we're snorting diamonds.
208200	211200	Like, you could say whatever you want.
212200	218200	There is a place, I was in Death Valley over Thanksgiving, there is a gas station slash
218200	224200	Mini Mart, actually quite a sizable establishment, and it is called Eddie World.
224200	234200	And the logo is a photograph of a child that I am told is the deceased child of the owners,
234200	238200	after which they named the Mini Mart, and it's really weird.
239200	240200	And that's it.
241200	243200	I spent a lot of time.
243200	245200	It is called Death Valley, you know.
245200	246200	Yeah, that's true.
246200	250200	I spent a lot of time, I don't know, I was really high and Cody was laughing,
250200	253200	so I started recording it because I didn't want to, because I knew if I tried to do it here,
253200	257200	she'd be like, why are you doing jokes about a dead kid?
258200	260200	Because they're hilarious.
260200	266200	But I did like, I'll just, I'll see if, let's see.
267200	271200	Because I started, I just, I was coming up with jingles kind of trying.
277200	284200	There's a world where you don't have a sandwich, and a world where we don't have our son.
284200	291200	When you eat steward supplies, and a place where you can come get everything,
291200	299200	come where we don't have everything, because we lost the most important thing in our lives.
300200	307200	Eddie World, you eat milk or glasses, Eddie World, our son can't come back,
307200	317200	Eddie World just comes and gets some candy, Eddie World, our whole will never be quite filled.
317200	324200	I think it goes on for seven more minutes.
329200	334200	And now you're applauding a child's death, but everybody out there voted for Trump,
334200	339200	so I'm sure Eddie did too, or he would have, he would have.
339200	344200	Man, speaking of child death, I was driving through a cemetery,
344200	352200	and the cemetery had all these weird street names that were all like kind of noble and like gravity, like heavy.
352200	356200	It was like noble spraying and like golden dawn and stuff.
356200	361200	And I found myself on a street that was called Baby Land,
362200	368200	and that's a terrifying realization to have when you're really high in a cemetery driving around.
368200	375200	And like right at the head of Baby Land was this giant like statue of a baby that was kind of like,
375200	380200	yeah, it was clearly, I was like, nope, there's definitely babies buried on this property.
381200	384200	And then I left, it was great.
385200	390200	Baby Land, I think a lot of cemeteries have a Baby Land too, I don't think that's unique.
391200	394200	Baby Land's a terrible name, though.
395200	403200	On the lighter side of child development, I guess you'd call him my pseudo-nephew because I'm dating his aunt,
403200	409200	Ryland, who maybe if you follow my Instagram, maybe you've seen him, the president of Train Town Kid.
409200	415200	He's four years old, and he was learning to drive on his grandpa's lap, like in Death Valley.
416200	421200	His grandpa was just steering with the hands on the bottom, but he was thinking he was driving.
427200	431200	He asked him after he finished, after he finally got tired of driving, which was an exhilarating experience for him,
431200	433200	he said, Ryland, how do you feel?
433200	437200	And he said, I feel like I'm five years old.
439200	442200	Which was pretty amazing, because he wasn't being glib or ironic.
442200	446200	He didn't know how funny that was, he really was like, that's how to express.
446200	452200	He's like, in his four-year-old mind, being five is going to have more energy to it.
452200	457200	I guess he's right, I guess it's not until you turn like 13 that you start dying, right?
460200	463200	As soon as you can reach the faucet, it's all downhill.
466200	471200	Well, it's the reproductive hormones probably hit your bloodstream, and then they start killing your body, right?
471200	476200	Because it's like, we're like mosquitoes, like nature's saying, okay, time to make more of you, or what good are you,
476200	479200	and also, if you can do that, bye.
481200	484200	Yeah, well, nobody's getting out alive.
485200	488200	I don't know why you're so quiet.
488200	490200	Did you enjoy your Death Valley experience? It looked like you had a lot of fun.
490200	492200	Well, you laughed at Eddie's death.
493200	495200	You have a chuckle at your own.
497200	500200	Wouldn't be a bad idea, karmically, I think.
502200	505200	Yeah, speaking of death, I mean, like I said, everybody out there voted for Trump,
505200	511200	and it's funny because as a liberal, you're out there, like, when I got to Death Valley,
511200	515200	I was like, oh, God, this is where I need to come now that Trump got elected,
515200	520200	and the place is filled with a bunch of people that are like, oh, this is where I need to be now that Obama got elected.
520200	524200	They're just walking around with guns on their hips, and they've created their own little world,
524200	527200	and everybody's from somewhere else.
527200	530200	Nothing is born in Death Valley.
531200	534200	They tried with Eddie, and he just like...
542200	546200	Yeah, the warning is in the name of the town. You don't do it.
546200	549200	Yeah, yeah. Did you know it's the hottest place on Earth?
549200	552200	You would think it's somewhere in Africa or the Middle East or something like...
552200	557200	The equator? Like, it's the hottest goddamn place on Earth recorded anyway, 135 degrees,
557200	563200	and every...the hottest day of the year, people gather and watch the temperature needle...
564200	572200	...passing out from heat stroke, and they all wait to celebrate the...if it gets up to 136 or whatever it is.
572200	574200	It doesn't get that hot in Saudi Arabia, or like...
574200	577200	And I would have thought, I would have thought, but apparently...
578200	585200	They used to think not as...that, yes, that is the case, but then there was some kind of thermometer recalibration or something.
585200	592200	Like, they were using bad thermometer...they were using Chinese steel in their thermometers over in Saudi Arabia.
592200	595200	Chinese steel is the cologne I'm wearing right now.
596200	600200	Anyworld! We've got everything but Eddie!
607200	614200	Anyworld! If we haven't got it, it's our son!
619200	624200	Anyworld! Our prices aren't just low, they're misdirected grief!
628200	632200	Do you have...are these all written down? Are you riffing these, or are these all written down?
632200	635200	I saw...I opened my notepad, I saw a couple of those...
638200	644200	I'm terribly sorry if for some reason there's somebody listening that is connected somehow to Eddie, and you're being traumatized by this.
644200	652200	I'm operating under the assumption that that's not the case, and therefore, you know, where you are as a figure in a textbook to us.
652200	656200	Like, Abraham Lincoln, whose assassination is no longer tragic, it's hilarious.
656200	662200	He got shot in the head, brains flew everywhere, Kennedy slightly less so, and, you know, time goes on.
662200	666200	Eddie, from his picture, looked like...it probably happened a while ago.
666200	676200	And it could be an urban legend. When you look at it, you go, I bet that's...it could be, like, unconfirmable.
676200	678200	Anyways...
678200	681200	Can't you ask the owners?
681200	685200	Who's gonna do that? I mean, like, I'm not gonna do that.
685200	689200	Plus, the place is so big, like, the owners aren't even there.
689200	693200	I mean, it was like...they had a lot of candy.
693200	696200	I bought a lot of candy.
696200	700200	Eddie loved candy.
700200	702200	Why does he love candy?
702200	707200	Since we're there, like, scraping the bottom of taste, like, I...
707200	712200	There was this fire in Oakland, this terrible tragedy, this warehouse thing.
712200	715200	And did anybody see the video?
715200	717200	I mean, some people out here might be connected to people.
717200	722200	Cody had a friend who lost two friends in that fire.
722200	734200	There was a video of a guy who was describing, like, trying to drag his friend out, who had broken his ankle.
734200	743200	And he was trying to drag his friend out of this inferno, and he's explaining to the news cameras, you know...
743200	748200	I thought, I was like, oh my God, this guy's so brave and vulnerable, like, you know, who would...
748200	756200	I mean, because he's describing the experience of trying to save his friend, and then it gets so hot, and his lungs are filling with smoke, and he...
756200	759200	He had no choice but to just let go and just walk away.
759200	761200	Like, run away, get out of there.
761200	764200	And he couldn't drag his friend out.
764200	766200	Had to leave him there.
766200	769200	But the guy's describing it, and he...
770200	772200	He describes it, and then he goes, like...
772200	778200	You know, obviously that's making him, like, tear up, and, like, he's still out there.
778200	785200	But then he says, and then I went out, and then I watched it all, all burn, all my stuff.
785200	787200	All my...
787200	790200	And he just started talking about all the things that he had in there.
790200	792200	Anyways.
792200	793200	That's just not...
793200	795200	It was such a weird build.
795200	799200	Like, the story about the friend, and then he was just, like...
799200	802200	He's like, my pants are in there.
802200	803200	I know nothing about this.
803200	805200	I've been in Mexico for almost a week.
805200	808200	I haven't watched any news at all, so...
808200	809200	Yeah.
809200	810200	Yeah.
810200	811200	How are you feeling?
811200	812200	We should...
812200	814200	We might want to take up this regiment.
814200	815200	Like, are you feeling...
815200	816200	Oh, my God.
816200	817200	Great.
817200	818200	I feel great.
818200	819200	I feel like I'm...
819200	821200	Mexico City is the most goddamn fun city.
821200	823200	If you haven't been there, really go down to Mexico City and chill out.
823200	824200	The people are cool.
824200	825200	They're laid back.
825200	826200	The food is fucking screaming.
826200	827200	They love music.
827200	828200	The architecture is wild.
828200	830200	There's dogs everywhere.
830200	831200	There's dogs everywhere.
831200	836200	And the thing is, I never once heard a dog bark.
836200	838200	No, I heard one dog bark when we were in...
838200	840200	Well, yeah, but you know they were barking in Spanish,
840200	842200	so you probably didn't recognize it.
842200	843200	Don't they...
843200	846200	You know, in French class, like, we always had...
846200	848200	You had to learn how all the animals, like...
848200	849200	Fau-fau.
849200	850200	Yeah.
850200	852200	Fau-fau?
852200	853200	Le meu, yeah.
853200	854200	Le meu.
854200	855200	Yeah.
855200	856200	But the dogs...
856200	860200	There's a park in Mexico, like, there's a big park in the Condesa area,
860200	862200	and there's a million dogs.
862200	865200	Dog walkers have, like, 40 dogs on one leader.
865200	866200	Like, it's amazing.
866200	869200	And all the dogs are just chilled out, having a good time.
869200	870200	No one's...
870200	872200	They're not jumping and barking and biting and scratching.
872200	875200	They're just the happiest, most well-socialized dogs in the world.
875200	876200	It's really great.
876200	879200	And then there went to this one place called...
879200	881200	Sochi...
881200	882200	Chocolate milk?
882200	883200	Sochi...
883200	884200	Sochi...
884200	885200	Sochi...
885200	887200	I don't know, what the fuck.
887200	890200	There's canals and it's fucking wild.
890200	892200	And there's an island of the dolls.
892200	895200	People just took baby dolls and nailed them to trees,
895200	897200	and it's the fucking creepiest-ass shit.
897200	902200	So there's just a whole island of dolls nailed to things.
902200	904200	And there's just feral chihuahuas running around everywhere.
904200	905200	It's fucking grand.
905200	909200	Is it possible that Mexico has affected your reactions to things?
909200	913200	Like, you're describing things that should make you upset.
913200	914200	Yeah.
914200	915200	But you're on a boat.
915200	917200	You're on these big colorful barges and these canals.
917200	921200	And then there's food, like, rose up next to you.
921200	922200	And there's a guy selling tamales.
922200	924200	And there's a woman selling fruit.
924200	925200	And there's enchiladas.
925200	927200	And then there's a bunch of bands.
927200	929200	There's like a thousand bands out there.
929200	932200	So we hired a mariachi band that came on board our boat.
932200	933200	And we're all just singing along.
933200	937200	And it was the fucking greatest day of my life.
937200	938200	All right.
938200	940200	Well, what's your favorite TV show right now?
940200	942200	What are you watching the most?
942200	943200	Probably Westworld.
943200	945200	All right.
945200	947200	Well, the finale's tonight.
947200	948200	I'm back.
948200	951200	I don't think I've seen two episodes back.
951200	952200	So no spoilers.
952200	953200	Yeah, well, OK.
953200	954200	No spoilers.
954200	957200	Don't say your groans are spoilers.
957200	958200	Everybody promise.
958200	960200	Well, let's not talk about Westworld at all tonight.
960200	962200	Please welcome our first guest, Ptolemy.
962200	963200	Slocum.
963200	964200	Slocum from Westworld.
964200	966200	Sylvester, the tech guy from Westworld.
966200	976200	He's the nerd that you tried to kill,
976200	980200	but you can't kill a nerd like Sylvester.
980200	982200	That's so easy.
982200	985200	Hi, everybody.
985200	989200	Probably second to the British writer character,
989200	991200	the least liked character.
991200	992200	So far.
992200	993200	So I've noticed.
993200	998200	I do feel like I am slightly more palpable than he.
998200	1001200	I shouldn't start with that.
1001200	1004200	Yeah, at least to my wife.
1004200	1007200	My wife likes me slightly better than him.
1007200	1008200	How did you...
1008200	1009200	Everybody's...
1009200	1010200	I mean, this is probably the...
1010200	1013200	This is a show that everybody's watched, at least in L.A.
1013200	1015200	And so you're...
1015200	1016200	This is brand new.
1016200	1020200	Like, we had Grey Worm from Game of Thrones on it.
1020200	1023200	And I was on a yacht with Game of Thrones people,
1023200	1024200	and all I can think to ask them is,
1024200	1026200	what does it feel like to be part of this thing?
1026200	1028200	But the answer is never satisfying,
1028200	1029200	but why don't you take a shot at it?
1029200	1031200	All right.
1031200	1033200	That's a great lead-in.
1033200	1035200	Yeah, it is interesting.
1035200	1038200	About six weeks ago, I was standing back where those guys are.
1038200	1041200	I see you by the bathroom because I had to walk past you.
1041200	1044200	And so this is like...
1044200	1048200	Six weeks later, my life is about, like, what?
1048200	1050200	30 yards different, you know?
1050200	1053200	But it's a big 30 yards, and it feels...
1053200	1056200	You mean by you were standing back there,
1056200	1059200	you mean you were just some regular Joe watching the show.
1059200	1060200	Yeah.
1060200	1063200	And now you're up here, like, in the limelight.
1063200	1065200	Right, yes.
1065200	1069200	But also you're on Westworld, which is more important.
1069200	1070200	Yeah.
1070200	1077200	Like, you're measuring what it's like to go from not being on Westworld
1077200	1079200	to being on Westworld by...
1079200	1082200	The yardstick you're using is my shitty show.
1082200	1084200	I feel like that's what...
1084200	1085200	It's confusing.
1085200	1089200	I thought that was your setup for, like,
1089200	1093200	how is life different for you in terms of, like, being on the show?
1093200	1096200	But if you want to talk about the experience of shooting that show,
1096200	1097200	it was fascinating.
1097200	1098200	Well, I want to talk about...
1098200	1099200	And that was, like, two years of fascinating
1099200	1101200	because it took two years to shoot one season.
1101200	1103200	Right, there's a question right there.
1103200	1106200	So we have to go back all the way two years ago to...
1106200	1109200	I think what a lot of us would like to hear is, like,
1109200	1113200	you going from being a guy who has not been cast on Westworld to...
1113200	1114200	Like, what's the...
1114200	1118200	Because there's got to be some little breathtaking banana peel stoplight
1118200	1122200	if this had happened differently story about you getting the role, right?
1122200	1125200	I mean, yeah, you're looking at...
1125200	1128200	You're looking at that moment, the fact that I'm even here at all,
1128200	1131200	because we, just as actors, attempt to do that constantly.
1131200	1136200	So this was very normal audition.
1136200	1139200	One audition, no callback, walked into the room.
1139200	1143200	I don't think they had even done an audition for this guy, Sylvester.
1143200	1145200	No one understood the script.
1145200	1149200	It was weird comments about, like, MSRA and, like, this abdomen.
1149200	1151200	Like, what the fuck are they talking about?
1151200	1153200	They didn't even know how to run the audition.
1153200	1156200	I was in there, I was like, I think, when I was reading it,
1156200	1160200	it was like, maybe this guy has his hands inside someone.
1160200	1163200	And so I don't even think they had ever done one of those,
1163200	1166200	never did a callback, didn't know that much about the show,
1166200	1169200	and I was just trying to get a job.
1169200	1171200	And what was your relationship with the property?
1171200	1173200	Were you a fan of the movie?
1173200	1174200	I knew the movie.
1174200	1177200	I still haven't seen the second. I really want to see the sequel.
1177200	1178200	Future World?
1178200	1180200	Yeah. Any thoughts?
1180200	1183200	Future World is even more 70s than Westworld.
1183200	1184200	Yeah.
1184200	1187200	Like, the 70s had third act problems.
1187200	1188200	Yes.
1188200	1195200	Until Jaws, at which point all movies stopped having third act problems,
1195200	1199200	but began to have the unified third act problem of all ripping off Jaws.
1199200	1201200	You know, it's like we all learned how to end a movie.
1201200	1202200	Right.
1202200	1204200	But then it was like a shackle, like that was.
1204200	1206200	Because it was successful, it's almost everything has to repeat that.
1206200	1207200	Yeah, now there's such a thing as a...
1207200	1209200	It's almost as bad as when your law wasn't there.
1209200	1210200	Every movie's gonna...
1210200	1212200	After Jaws, every movie ends with a blown up shark.
1212200	1213200	Yes.
1213200	1214200	Yeah.
1214200	1217200	I mean, essentially, I mean, or a safe cat.
1217200	1220200	The shark industry in Hollywood and those people have Jaws.
1220200	1226200	It was... Because before that, the 70s was like, you know, you were watching a movie
1226200	1228200	and it was like, oh, Gene Hackman might just run off screen
1228200	1231200	and there's a gunshot and a cat meows. And you're like, what the fuck just happened?
1231200	1233200	Yeah. They didn't have any rules like that.
1233200	1237200	And then Westworld's a great example. I love the setup of Westworld.
1237200	1239200	It starts at that airport, if you remember.
1239200	1240200	Yeah.
1240200	1243200	It's a really cool setup, very elegant, very efficient.
1243200	1248200	And then starting in, like, basically the third act, they didn't attempt anything.
1248200	1250200	They didn't have any plan.
1250200	1253200	It was just, this guy starts running, he never stops.
1253200	1254200	Okay.
1254200	1256200	And it's just one long chase scene. It's like, what happened?
1256200	1257200	Yeah.
1257200	1260200	But they could do that and I actually kind of prefer it.
1260200	1263200	I mean, I guess because it's like... Yeah, how should...
1263200	1269200	Because the thing that you have to gain from an era where nobody really knows how to end a movie
1270200	1276200	is that every once in a while, I mean, you're sitting there, you're on the edge of your seat
1276200	1279200	because you don't know, you're in the hands of a lunatic.
1279200	1280200	You're like, I don't know.
1280200	1284200	Like, he could just, like, Easy Rider just ends with fucking...
1284200	1285200	Yes.
1285200	1288200	Just like, get your motor running, hey!
1288200	1290200	And then it just credits.
1290200	1291200	Yeah.
1291200	1298200	Even at the cemetery scene in Easy Rider, like, should I have gone on this ride with him?
1298200	1301200	Yeah, did you break the movie, Dennis Hopper?
1301200	1306200	But the potential that that is waiting for you at the end of this film is pretty exciting.
1306200	1308200	Yeah, because that makes you care about the characters
1308200	1311200	because if you were in real life, we're running from Yul Brenner,
1311200	1314200	who was programmed to kill you or rather programmed to not kill you
1314200	1317200	and had decided to not be programmed that way anymore.
1317200	1324200	Like, if you were having that experience, you should feel unlike the way you feel
1324200	1325200	when you're watching Jaws.
1325200	1327200	You should feel like, what the fuck is happening?
1327200	1329200	How do I get out of this? Can I just play dead?
1329200	1334200	The other thing about the 70s movies is, like, I watched the Westworld movie
1334200	1337200	in preparation for the series and then I also watched Logan's Run.
1337200	1345200	And it's amazing how flimsy the evil is, like, how easy it is to take down.
1345200	1349200	In Logan's Run, he comes back from the lack of sanctuary.
1349200	1353200	The computer that runs all of dystopian life asks him,
1353200	1356200	where's sanctuary? He says, there isn't one.
1356200	1358200	It says, bullshit, I'm going to read your mind.
1358200	1363200	And his mind says, there's no sanctuary. And the computer explodes.
1363200	1367200	And the shopping mall they live in starts falling apart
1367200	1370200	and all of the people in pantyhose have to run out
1370200	1375200	and they see an old man and touch his beard and it's over.
1376200	1384200	Because it was that easy back then to foil an oligarchic technocratic hydra.
1384200	1387200	Yeah, so going back to this show...
1387200	1389200	No.
1389200	1391200	Because I didn't realize I might have...
1391200	1394200	So you did this audition, which it sounds like it was in a casting director's office.
1394200	1395200	Yeah.
1395200	1397200	And you booked it off of one read?
1397200	1400200	One read, no callback, no idea about anything.
1400200	1401200	Hired. Fucking Dutch.
1401200	1402200	I just hired.
1402200	1403200	That's the best.
1403200	1408200	Clearly, and I'm used to this, not going to go anywhere or be anything.
1408200	1410200	That was just my mentality.
1410200	1414200	And it was basically like four lines in a pilot.
1414200	1419200	And I did know that people were in it, but I just didn't know what to expect.
1419200	1420200	That's so cool though.
1420200	1422200	How much of your day when you're on the set for you
1422200	1426200	is spent looking at naked actors in a chair?
1426200	1429200	Yeah, they're everywhere.
1429200	1432200	Because not just the chairs, everyone laying down,
1432200	1435200	unless they have their legs cut off, is a real person.
1435200	1436200	Really?
1436200	1438200	So they're all fully naked with scars.
1438200	1442200	It is a real fascinating emotional cocktail
1442200	1447200	to see an attractive naked person that is gashed open
1447200	1451200	because you're like, want to help them and also aroused by it.
1451200	1454200	It's very... it's difficult.
1455200	1460200	This segment brought to you by Eddie World.
1460200	1466200	Eddie World, where the customer probably has a child's day.
1466200	1467200	Eddie World.
1467200	1469200	The idea is that I get my glasses on,
1469200	1473200	and it's real offensive to me how hard it is to tell a male from a female
1473200	1477200	laying down like 10 feet away if your glasses are not on.
1477200	1482200	I was offended by once they sat, I was like, no!
1483200	1485200	I think we're offended by your adherence
1485200	1490200	to a binary heteronormative dichotomous...
1490200	1493200	You want to cash in on that one, all right.
1496200	1498200	God damn it, the shit.
1498200	1500200	Oh, okay, come on, tell the truth.
1500200	1503200	Some of that shit's from Game of Thrones sets.
1503200	1505200	I don't know.
1505200	1506200	There was like sets in there where I'm like,
1506200	1509200	come on, Cody was really the one that pointed it out.
1509200	1511200	She's like, come on, that's a Game of Thrones set.
1511200	1515200	They're taking curtains and stuff, and then the heads on the wall.
1515200	1517200	Oh, it does look like that, no.
1517200	1519200	But HBO wouldn't have those laying around.
1519200	1522200	No, that's all in England, I think those sets are.
1522200	1525200	No, this is all up in about 30 minutes north of here,
1525200	1528200	kind of parallel to where Six Flags is.
1528200	1533200	But they do have old tanks laying around from other productions,
1533200	1537200	and some original Mad Max-y kind of little cars
1537200	1540200	that were welded on one of those motorcycles.
1540200	1541200	Like old stuff.
1541200	1543200	So there is stuff laying around, but all that,
1543200	1545200	I don't think they duplicated anything.
1545200	1547200	So do you have viewing parties?
1547200	1549200	No.
1549200	1550200	Are you married, or are you in a relationship?
1550200	1554200	I'm married to what gender person?
1554200	1557200	To a wife, yeah.
1557200	1558200	I'm married to a wife.
1558200	1559200	A lady wife or a family wife?
1559200	1560200	A lady wife.
1560200	1563200	It is from 10 feet away.
1563200	1565200	Yeah, do you know?
1565200	1566200	No, I know.
1566200	1568200	I know who she is.
1568200	1570200	I saw your wife laying on a metal slab,
1570200	1573200	and I thought I really couldn't tell if she was a dude or not.
1573200	1576200	Is she...
1576200	1578200	Is she not going to react to that?
1578200	1580200	I'm just going to...
1580200	1583200	It didn't pass me by, like I'm still talking about it.
1583200	1587200	It's not the world's best kept secret that your wife likes to lay naked on slab.
1587200	1590200	That you followed it up with a second one.
1590200	1592200	I tried not to react to the first one.
1592200	1593200	She's known as Slabley.
1593200	1597200	So none of us are like, son of a bitch.
1598200	1600200	Sometimes I see...
1600200	1603200	I go, I think that's a real doll or something like in the background.
1603200	1605200	They never use fake people.
1605200	1608200	They did if their bodies were cut up, but they were real people.
1608200	1609200	Or if they were just sitting in a chair.
1609200	1610200	No, those are real people.
1610200	1611200	Really?
1611200	1613200	How are they holding that still?
1613200	1615200	Well, two things.
1615200	1617200	One of them was my...
1617200	1622200	A dude I grew up with in Lodi, California, this small town,
1622200	1624200	we grew up like three houses down from each other,
1624200	1627200	and our families were like sister families.
1627200	1630200	You know, like once a week you have dinner with them.
1630200	1633200	This dude named Craig...
1633200	1634200	Comes in at night.
1634200	1635200	Comes in at night.
1635200	1639200	And touches everyone's muscles with a special acid.
1639200	1642200	They put the shots under a pillow.
1642200	1647200	He was working on the show, which is crazy because we grew up next to each other.
1647200	1648200	He was one of the naked...
1648200	1652200	No, he does post, but what he does is he'll take a frame,
1653200	1658200	and if it is still, but there is somebody that's going through and stilling images
1658200	1660200	because people can't be that still.
1660200	1661200	Right.
1661200	1662200	So easily just like split screen.
1662200	1663200	It's not split screen.
1663200	1664200	It'll be like a frame.
1664200	1667200	So if something, if there is...
1667200	1670200	That's often how we would get it to look like Chevy Chase knew all his lines.
1670200	1671200	Yeah.
1671200	1675200	We would do liquid more for...
1675200	1678200	You see those two shots of him next to Donald Glover?
1679200	1682200	See if there's a clock in the background of Chevy's lines
1682200	1686200	because that fucking thing is going to go...
1686200	1689200	Some extra in the background is hot.
1689200	1693200	Hot dog keeps changing sizes.
1693200	1694200	The candles are all different.
1694200	1695200	We wish him the best.
1695200	1698200	He's in recovery right now.
1698200	1700200	Can we go back?
1700200	1703200	Ptolemy?
1703200	1706200	Ptolemy's slogan, first of all, is a fantastic name.
1706200	1707200	Yeah.
1707200	1708200	I said, is it Ptolemy?
1708200	1711200	And you said that's the correct pronunciation, but it's not the American pronunciation.
1711200	1712200	Yeah.
1712200	1713200	More English would be Ptolemy.
1713200	1714200	Greek would be Ptolemy.
1714200	1716200	They actually pronounce the P, Ptolemy.
1716200	1718200	They put the P in there.
1718200	1719200	Yeah.
1719200	1720200	You said you were born in Kenya.
1720200	1721200	I was born in Kenya.
1721200	1725200	So I was born on the eclipse of the moon, which is the story I was told,
1725200	1728200	but then I went to an astrologer and I was born like two days after the eclipse of the moon.
1728200	1730200	Now, who notices when the moon is eclipsed?
1730200	1732200	Well, my parents...
1732200	1734200	What eclipse is it, the sun?
1734200	1737200	No, the earth eclipses anything, right?
1737200	1738200	I don't know.
1738200	1739200	I don't know.
1739200	1743200	The moon can eclipse the sun and the earth can eclipse both.
1743200	1747200	The reason why you don't see the moon all the time is because of the shadow of the earth.
1747200	1748200	What kind of show is this?
1748200	1749200	You're blowing my mind.
1749200	1752200	Yeah.
1752200	1755200	So, yeah, it was a full eclipse of the moon, which aren't that rare.
1755200	1758200	And then Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer.
1758200	1765200	Claudius Ptolemaeus was a Greek astronomer, lived in Egypt, Alexander, when the Greek empire owned Egypt.
1765200	1767200	That was the family of the Cleopatra descendants.
1767200	1768200	No.
1768200	1769200	No.
1769200	1771200	The different guys, similar era.
1771200	1773200	Were your parents...
1773200	1774200	Stoned?
1774200	1775200	Stoned?
1775200	1782200	Why were they in Kenya and why are they naming you that and what's with them?
1782200	1785200	By the way, I'm a bad interviewer.
1785200	1791200	Well, you haven't attacked my wife.
1791200	1792200	And I've gotten over it.
1792200	1793200	I'm not thinking about it anymore.
1793200	1794200	I don't think I attacked you so much.
1794200	1795200	You attacked...
1795200	1797200	You called her a slab woman.
1797200	1800200	I'm pretty sure you called her a slab woman.
1800200	1801200	I didn't.
1801200	1802200	I said people called her a slab lady.
1802200	1806200	I never said that at all.
1806200	1808200	I simply am a journalist, sir.
1808200	1814200	Well, and for my part, I've gotten over it.
1814200	1820200	Yeah, it's an interesting story and I don't know how far to go into it, but it's dark.
1820200	1821200	Really?
1821200	1823200	Your parents having you is dark?
1823200	1827200	That story is much darker than I knew and I found out about it recently.
1827200	1828200	Really?
1828200	1831200	Yeah, so how much time do you want to commit to this thing?
1831200	1838200	Well, we've got other people to meet, but let's...
1838200	1839200	I'll try to do the fast version.
1840200	1843200	The story that I was told was that he worked for an American...
1843200	1847200	I should not be telling this story.
1847200	1851200	This is not going well already.
1851200	1856200	So the story I was told as a child growing up was that he was building a fertilizer plant for the Kenyan government.
1856200	1858200	There was an American company building a fertilizer plant for the Kenyan government.
1858200	1859200	It didn't go well.
1859200	1863200	And so we got extradited out of the country and they're like, the Kenyan government is horrible.
1863200	1868200	And they threatened our lives a couple of times and eventually we escaped and got out.
1868200	1873200	I went to Cincinnati, at which point my parents' relationship fell apart.
1873200	1877200	Because it was so stressful to get out of Kenya.
1877200	1881200	It's one of those couples that's going to blame the Kenyan government hating them.
1881200	1884200	I'm not working it out.
1888200	1894200	So I have to tell this difficult story, but also you're going to attack me along the way.
1894200	1895200	Alright, okay. I didn't know.
1895200	1901200	If we do attack anything, we'll just put a wound in its head and strip it naked so that you can derive sexual pleasure from it.
1901200	1905200	That is literally my nightmare.
1905200	1910200	I hope I end up naked on this show. I've earned it.
1910200	1916200	That was my Westworld theory, by the way, was that the show was taking place in the year...
1916200	1918200	Sorry to cut you off.
1918200	1921200	The show's taking place in the year 7000 and all of the robots...
1921200	1929200	There are no humans left. All of the robots go to Westworld as a kind of mecca where they can experience a Buddhist reincarnation process
1929200	1939200	where you can rise up through the Rosencrances and the Guildensterns to the Maves, to the Athony Hopkinses,
1939200	1942200	and then cycle back through.
1942200	1950200	Because they've lost all contact with their human roots and they go there to revive themselves spiritually.
1950200	1952200	It's like their wailing wall.
1952200	1958200	Basically, on that theory, someone like Maeve is actually attending the park?
1958200	1962200	That you would eventually see that Maeve was also like a...
1962200	1966200	Yeah, that she'd be in that photo with Anthony Hopkins when they're starting Westworld or something,
1966200	1970200	that she'd be in the background with a lab coat on or something, and that you'd be like a bartender.
1970200	1974200	And that you'd go, oh, that's pointless.
1974200	1979200	What is the deal with the English guy? With the British overacting screaming guy?
1979200	1981200	I didn't. I didn't meet him.
1981200	1986200	Wait, wait. Is he in a different show?
1986200	1990200	Does he know that he's also in the same show as everybody else?
1990200	1997200	I'm pretty sure. I didn't know he was even... I only read my scenes.
1997200	2004200	They probably shot you out in an hour. All of your scenes are in one room in UTH basement.
2004200	2014200	No, it took the full two years.
2014200	2017200	Does that mean to impugn your craft?
2017200	2020200	No, logistically, I give you credit.
2020200	2022200	Same word, Jerome.
2022200	2026200	Yeah, I'm thinking about all the time that I wasted.
2026200	2030200	Because had you been shooting the show, it would have been much more efficient.
2030200	2032200	I'm known for my efficiency.
2032200	2038200	Did you ever have to interact? Because I think the most fascinating part of that show is when they're just walking that bison around in that glass room.
2038200	2040200	It's the funniest thing that you've got.
2040200	2044200	Just showing a bison how to walk around.
2044200	2052200	They've mastered post-singularity nanotechnological life creation, but yeah, it's well known.
2052200	2056200	You've got to prime that bison if it doesn't.
2056200	2066200	The coolest thing, though, is that when Maeve was walking through... No spoilers here if you're listening, I don't think.
2066200	2075200	Walking through, and then there's in those rooms the poker game guys, and then they all draw guns, and then the technician goes,
2075200	2078200	all right, back to one or whatever, and they all pick up their cards.
2078200	2082200	I thought that shit was... It's a cool show. We like it.
2082200	2086200	I do wish there was a slower version of that show.
2086200	2092200	Here's my thing. I would watch ten episodes where there is no plot and just show us...
2092200	2098200	Some dude getting off a train and getting on a horse and riding in one direction and just see what happens.
2098200	2104200	It's called Love Boat meets Downton Abbey meets Deadwood.
2104200	2111200	There's guest stars, and you don't have to do the serialized, like, oh shit, this whole park's going crazy.
2111200	2115200	It is Love Boat. That's right. It's fucking Love Boat.
2115200	2117200	Or it's Fantasy Avenue. They could just do that.
2117200	2119200	I think before the show could not, they thought that's what it was going to be.
2119200	2122200	People were like, oh, so each episode, someone new comes, and then they...
2122200	2127200	Oh, Tatoo, here comes Bill Gates. He's a philanthropist.
2127200	2130200	His fantasy is to be a gunslinger.
2130200	2133200	Boss! Boss, isn't that everybody?
2133200	2139200	Yes, Tatoo, but Bill Gates wants to sling guns in a way that breaks his heart.
2139200	2143200	I think you're tampering with magic and you don't understand, boss.
2143200	2147200	That's okay. Apparently I'm God. We all learn in season three.
2147200	2153200	There was a show called Fantasy Island that we've talked about with Paul F. Thompson.
2153200	2156200	Detrain! Detrain!
2156200	2160200	Good night, everybody. Detrain, yeah, yeah.
2160200	2164200	That was my fantasy Westworld. I'm not knocking this one.
2164200	2166200	The storyline story is fascinating.
2166200	2171200	The idea that there would be an upstairs, downstairs, like down in Abbey.
2171200	2176200	The servants were the gods. The gods lived in the underworld,
2176200	2181200	and they were these polyamorous, asexual, multi-sex...
2181200	2184200	They were so fucked up, like what you're saying.
2184200	2189200	They're looking at... You come to Westworld to fuck and murder in a simulation,
2189200	2193200	and these people designed the things and sent them back up,
2193200	2199200	and how fucked up would they be as people had their culture and stuff.
2199200	2202200	It turned out a lot like that British guy on the show.
2202200	2205200	Could there be a character that just comes in,
2205200	2208200	that just wants to open up a little mercantile store?
2208200	2212200	I want to become a blacksmith. I really want to get into blacksmiths.
2213200	2216200	Here's one thought that I've had that I haven't shared.
2216200	2219200	I probably shouldn't, but I do think there are a couple people probably
2219200	2222200	that would go to the park, pay to go to the park,
2222200	2226200	and then try to convince people that we're visiting that they are robots.
2226200	2228200	No, of course.
2228200	2231200	And have sex with people as almost like a servant.
2231200	2234200	Just want to feel what that's like to go through it,
2234200	2237200	because people are that fucked up.
2237200	2239200	Of course they are. Go to any Ren fair, yes.
2239200	2241200	Yes, exactly.
2242200	2245200	The people that aren't getting paid that are walking around going,
2245200	2248200	I don't know Governor, and you're like, your dream is to,
2248200	2251200	this guy's making $5 an hour and he hates doing it.
2251200	2253200	You want to do it for free.
2253200	2256200	It'd be like a non-crying game.
2256200	2261200	What happens if the guns that the guests have,
2261200	2264200	are they real bullets, right? They're blowing away the robots.
2264200	2265200	What's keeping them from...
2265200	2266200	I have no idea.
2266200	2268200	From accidentally blowing away somebody that's another guest,
2268200	2269200	and they just didn't realize.
2269200	2273200	Well, my assumption is that it is some kind of charge of some kind,
2273200	2275200	and it either... I don't know.
2275200	2277200	Some people get hit and then they fall in and they go,
2277200	2280200	Owie, and it has something to do with the further out you go,
2280200	2285200	you're volunteering for the potential for physical abuse,
2285200	2287200	but there's still cardinal rules.
2287200	2288200	I can't leave a mark.
2288200	2289200	Maybe.
2289200	2291200	That's what I'm hearing alluded to.
2291200	2292200	That doesn't seem from the show...
2292200	2295200	Again, I'm just watching as a fan, but people get punched.
2295200	2297200	What happens there?
2297200	2299200	I feel like Ed Harris' character is out there.
2299200	2303200	By the way, I know there's these reveals and shit that I'm not talking about,
2303200	2306200	so I'm not... I'm staring clear of spoilers,
2306200	2311200	but it seems like Ed Harris' character was going further and further out,
2311200	2314200	where they can punch you in the face,
2314200	2316200	so they can knock you unconscious.
2320200	2322200	You can tell the writers when you go back to work,
2322200	2324200	I could use a little more clarity on that.
2324200	2325200	No, I'm kidding.
2326200	2328200	They have their thing going.
2328200	2329200	So...
2329200	2330200	Okay, so...
2330200	2331200	Well, let's...
2333200	2334200	Do you want me to...
2334200	2335200	Do you want me to...
2335200	2336200	Do you want me to...
2337200	2338200	Oh, he's gone.
2338200	2340200	I believe I can fly.
2340200	2341200	He's gone.
2341200	2342200	I believe I can touch.
2342200	2343200	Eddie!
2350200	2353200	Do you want me to tell you the very quick version
2353200	2355200	of the other side of that Kenyan story?
2355200	2357200	Yes, the Kenyan government's side.
2357200	2360200	Yeah, before I was born, my father worked for the CIA.
2360200	2361200	Oh, my God!
2361200	2362200	Yeah.
2362200	2366200	Turns out, my father was the Bernie Madoff of Kenya.
2367200	2369200	And I didn't find that out until 2012,
2369200	2374200	when information came out that that plant that he was supposedly had built,
2374200	2378200	the Kenyan government was making payments on it for 30 years
2378200	2382200	to a Brussels company, a shell company,
2382200	2384200	so the entire thing was a scam.
2384200	2385200	Oh, my God.
2385200	2387200	They scammed the entire country, and that's my father.
2387200	2391200	The only thing that would make this story good would be if it was in Nigeria.
2392200	2393200	What?
2393200	2395200	Your dad's job was to scam Nigerians.
2395200	2396200	Never mind.
2397200	2400200	Oh, now I understand that.
2400200	2401200	Yeah.
2401200	2402200	But so his job...
2402200	2404200	So that was the CIA operation was just to...
2404200	2405200	We don't...
2405200	2406200	I don't know.
2406200	2407200	We don't know.
2407200	2410200	So when they threatened your lives, they had reason to because they...
2410200	2411200	Exactly.
2411200	2414200	And some of this came out with WikiLeaks has...
2415200	2417200	Why am I talking about this?
2418200	2421200	Are we all going to learn about your dad from WikiLeaks?
2421200	2423200	Is there going to be a drone strike on Harmon?
2423200	2424200	No.
2424200	2427200	But they have the embassy recordings.
2427200	2432200	They have the transcripts of when he had to go to the embassy to try to hide.
2432200	2433200	So they have like...
2433200	2435200	Ken Zilogram is like, why am I saying the name?
2435200	2440200	But they have those transcripts of like when he was...
2440200	2444200	Like what the actual American interaction with this guy who was...
2444200	2445200	So he gave you...
2445200	2446200	Your name is like a...
2446200	2449200	It's like a spy operation.
2449200	2451200	Like Tolomei.
2451200	2452200	Like it's like...
2452200	2456200	Yeah, there might be the key to the entire my name.
2456200	2458200	I might have it in me.
2458200	2460200	I think your name is like a password in some vault door.
2460200	2461200	Right.
2461200	2464200	First I have to do sexy laser hopscotch.
2466200	2469200	And then when I get to the thing I'm like, there's a password?
2469200	2470200	Tolomei.
2471200	2472200	Yeah.
2472200	2474200	I put my like hand on it.
2474200	2479200	Or they realize like it's inside me some like some kind of Horcrux and they have to kill me to get it out.
2479200	2480200	Oh my God.
2480200	2482200	Like your scalp has a maze on it.
2485200	2486200	That's...
2486200	2487200	That's a...
2487200	2488200	It's a show, right?
2488200	2489200	You understand?
2489200	2490200	It's like a fiction.
2490200	2491200	It's a fiction.
2491200	2492200	No, I don't think your scalp has a show.
2492200	2494200	So there's a maze on it.
2494200	2495200	No, I...
2495200	2500200	This is getting a little bit like one of those 70s movies where you don't know how it's going to end.
2500200	2502200	And I'm slightly concerned.
2502200	2509200	By the way, if that scalp maze doesn't turn out to come to some use, some navigational purpose,
2509200	2512200	I want some of my HBO money back.
2512200	2517200	If he doesn't pull that scalp back out and go like, well, we should be about in the middle.
2517200	2523200	We're right by the eyebrow.
2523200	2527200	The back side of the eyebrow.
2527200	2528200	All right.
2528200	2529200	Well, let's...
2529200	2540200	Speaking of gore and things human and visceral, your character has to deal in robotic blood and guts.
2540200	2541200	And I...
2541200	2546200	In my genius of booking guests, like I thought to fit like a tumbling key.
2546200	2550200	You just asked me to do the show like 10 minutes before.
2550200	2551200	Yeah, that's true.
2551200	2552200	Oh, okay.
2552200	2555200	But then I saw this connection and I'm excited about it.
2555200	2556200	We have...
2556200	2557200	I met this couple.
2557200	2561200	Let's bring out Alan and Katrina.
2561200	2563200	I won't use their last names.
2577200	2580200	Ready world, our loss is your gain.
2587200	2588200	All right.
2588200	2591200	Alan and Katrina, you guys are EMTs, both of you.
2591200	2592200	Correct.
2592200	2594200	You're a married EMT couple.
2594200	2595200	Actually, we're just friends.
2595200	2596200	We're not married.
2596200	2597200	We're roommates.
2597200	2598200	What?
2598200	2599200	Yes.
2599200	2600200	Wait, shut up.
2600200	2601200	Wait.
2601200	2602200	Ready world.
2602200	2604200	Turn around and Katrina everybody.
2604200	2605200	Wait.
2606200	2610200	How many times have you heard me talk to you as if you were husband and wife?
2610200	2614200	Actually, the only time was when we talked in the green room.
2614200	2617200	Before that, it was just Steve as far as I know.
2617200	2620200	But I was like, okay, well, we'll correct him when we get a chance.
2620200	2621200	Okay.
2621200	2623200	So whose kids did I meet?
2623200	2624200	You met my kids.
2624200	2625200	Okay.
2625200	2626200	You're just friends with Katrina.
2626200	2627200	You're not married.
2627200	2629200	Those were not her kids.
2629200	2630200	No.
2630200	2631200	All right.
2631200	2632200	Fantastic.
2632200	2633200	All right.
2633200	2634200	Well, I mean, God, you guys are so boring now.
2635200	2636200	I thought you were married.
2636200	2637200	No, the marriage had nothing to do with it.
2637200	2638200	I'm just fascinated.
2638200	2639200	I could get that wrong somehow.
2639200	2640200	Okay.
2640200	2648200	So anyways, but I met you guys and your kids.
2648200	2656200	You guys had, we met at Stan Lee's Kamikaze Expo in line to meet Stan Lee, which I was
2656200	2663200	told was happening because Stan Lee wanted to meet me.
2663200	2667200	And you had been told was happening because you were a contest winner and got to meet
2667200	2668200	Stan Lee.
2668200	2673200	And both of us experienced the same thing, which is a very confusing, kind of like awkward,
2673200	2677200	like, if you had told me this is how it was going to work, I could have opted out.
2677200	2682200	Like, kind of meeting with a very beleaguered, not beleaguered, he wasn't cranky, he's just
2682200	2685200	kind of, he's Stan Lee, he's got bigger fish to fry.
2685200	2688200	He's just kind of like, what?
2688200	2690200	He's still got a pep in his step.
2690200	2694200	I mean, he's really, as far as what I see him, he's walking around like he's 20 years
2694200	2695200	old.
2695200	2696200	Yeah.
2696200	2697200	I don't know how old he is.
2697200	2698200	93.
2698200	2699200	Jesus.
2699200	2700200	Yes.
2700200	2701200	He's 93 years old and he walks around.
2701200	2709200	I mean, we pick up patients every day that they're 30 years old and I can't walk to the
2709200	2710200	gurney.
2710200	2711200	Well, what happened?
2711200	2712200	I stubbed my toe.
2712200	2713200	Really?
2713200	2716200	This is what you're going to go with when we get to the hospital, you stubbed your toe.
2716200	2717200	You don't need to go to the hospital.
2717200	2718200	Yes, I do.
2719200	2722200	Stan Lee's walking around in 93 like he's the godfather and you can't get to the gurney
2722200	2723200	because you stubbed your toe.
2723200	2724200	Yeah.
2724200	2725200	Yeah.
2725200	2728200	So he's doing great, but honestly, yeah, if you guys haven't met him and want to meet
2728200	2730200	him, yeah, soon.
2731200	2733200	But maybe he's never stubbed his toe.
2733200	2737200	Maybe Stan Lee is only 93 because somehow and then he's going to stub his toe and just
2737200	2739200	shatter like gloves.
2739200	2741200	Oh, just sick.
2741200	2743200	Knock on wood.
2743200	2748200	But anyways, we met him, which was essentially it was like, it was like, Stan Lee wants to
2748200	2749200	meet you.
2749200	2751200	Well, no, he doesn't.
2751200	2756200	We were brought to the front of an autograph line at a standard convention thing and then
2756200	2759200	it was like, let me introduce you to, this is Dan Harmon.
2759200	2762200	He has a show called Rick and Marty.
2762200	2763200	Oh, is that on the radio?
2763200	2766200	He said something like that.
2766200	2769200	I didn't know if he was doing a bid or not or if that was like, I don't know if that
2769200	2773200	was like a Stan Lee standard bid or if he, or if he really was like, like, like, like,
2773200	2777200	hey, maybe, I mean, maybe it's on the radio.
2777200	2781200	But anyways, we, so radio TV shows are what he knows.
2781200	2782200	Yeah.
2782200	2783200	Yeah.
2783200	2784200	That's what he grew up on.
2784200	2785200	Like you, you, you guys.
2785200	2787200	So then you were standing there and I was like, I would, I was wondering who the hell
2787200	2788200	are these guys?
2788200	2789200	Like, I didn't know.
2789200	2791200	I thought maybe you were like, you could have been somebody from a CW show or something.
2791200	2796200	I didn't know because I was there to do a panel and then, and then, and then meet,
2796200	2797200	meet Stanley.
2797200	2798200	And then you guys were there.
2798200	2799200	You were cosplaying.
2799200	2801200	You were, you were your green lantern.
2801200	2806200	I was the flash that day as we did a group as the blue lanterns.
2806200	2810200	And my character was the flash that had been recruited by the blue lanterns.
2810200	2812200	So those lanterns.
2812200	2813200	Yeah.
2813200	2815200	It was a symbol of hope.
2815200	2818200	You love, you love the lantern mythology like that.
2818200	2822200	I actually do enjoy a lot of the mountain lantern mythology.
2822200	2827200	I think it, I think it shows the perspective of a lot of people's personalities and how
2827200	2831200	we're all different and how things balance out and keep each other in check.
2831200	2832200	So yeah.
2832200	2836200	Because if you're a green lantern, you're basing it on willpower, right?
2836200	2837200	What's blue again?
2837200	2838200	Hope.
2838200	2839200	Okay.
2839200	2840200	So hope versus willpower.
2840200	2844200	See, you could have willpower and bring that to bear with hope.
2844200	2848200	Couldn't you, couldn't you hope with will, with a strong will?
2848200	2849200	Yes.
2849200	2851200	Or be angry with a strong will.
2851200	2855200	But you could have a strong will and still be like, oh, I can't do this.
2855200	2856200	This sucks.
2856200	2857200	I don't want to get out of bed.
2857200	2859200	I work at Walmart.
2859200	2860200	What's that?
2860200	2861200	Anywhere?
2861200	2862200	Anywhere?
2862200	2863200	Anywhere?
2863200	2864200	No.
2864200	2865200	Anywhere.
2865200	2866200	Anywhere.
2866200	2867200	Yes.
2867200	2868200	Anywhere.
2868200	2869200	There we go.
2869200	2870200	Yeah.
2870200	2871200	I mean, yeah.
2871200	2872200	Okay.
2872200	2873200	Well, I don't know.
2873200	2874200	Here's the thing.
2874200	2875200	I'm a verbal thinker.
2875200	2876200	I don't like the superpower where I can make a green thing in front of me.
2876200	2877200	And then it's like, oh, oh no, there's a yellow thing.
2877200	2879200	That's my worst enemy.
2880200	2881200	What is the green thing?
2881200	2883200	The green thing is like a machine gun.
2883200	2885200	I made a green machine gun.
2885200	2886200	Oh, great.
2886200	2889200	That's clever that you thought of a machine gun.
2889200	2892200	Anyways, I don't want to shit on your life.
2892200	2893200	No problem.
2893200	2895200	Katrina, what were you dressed as?
2895200	2898200	I was debuting Jack Skellington Assassin.
2898200	2901200	So Assassin's Creed, Jack Skellington version.
2901200	2902200	Nice.
2902200	2905200	And you guys are married, which I thought was so cool.
2906200	2909200	Congratulations, by the way.
2909200	2911200	I like when you said that you were debuting it.
2911200	2915200	So that was the inaugural go at this particular cosplay?
2915200	2916200	It was.
2916200	2918200	I had just finished it the night before.
2918200	2921200	But yeah, it was where I debuted that new cosplay.
2921200	2922200	Yeah.
2922200	2923200	Did it get some love?
2923200	2924200	Did you get some good attention for that?
2924200	2925200	It actually did it.
2925200	2926200	It was a big hit.
2926200	2927200	Are you all right, Tolome?
2927200	2928200	Yeah, I'm good.
2928200	2929200	Oh, he's asleep now.
2929200	2934200	I'm kind of a fan of the lantern situation, but I'm trying to keep my mouth shut.
2934200	2935200	Oh.
2935200	2936200	Well, all right.
2936200	2937200	I mean, sell me on Green Lantern.
2937200	2938200	Look, Eric.
2938200	2939200	It's imagination.
2939200	2940200	Eric Esquivel's here.
2940200	2941200	He sold me on Superman.
2941200	2943200	Like, I fucking love Superman now, you know?
2943200	2944200	Like, tell me about him.
2944200	2946200	Well, so here's the thing about Superman.
2946200	2952200	In my opinion, like, all of these things came from an aspect of human nature that was then
2952200	2955200	expanded upon as a what if.
2955200	2959200	It's as, like, the natural incarnation of that thing.
2959200	2962200	And one of the things that we have as humans is imagination.
2963200	2968200	Like, what if I could just imagine something to will it into place?
2968200	2971200	The colors thing, that is a currency that it's using.
2971200	2972200	There's just, like, differences.
2972200	2975200	And there's a lot of card games that are based on, like, colors or what have you.
2975200	2979200	But the essence of, wouldn't it be cool if I could lift something?
2979200	2981200	What if I could lift a million things?
2981200	2982200	You know what I mean?
2982200	2983200	It's just an extension of a human trait.
2983200	2986200	And this trait is imagination itself.
2986200	2987200	And that is a really cool thing to follow.
2987200	2991200	Like, it's so fun to, like, celebrate that as a power.
2991200	2993200	And a physical incarnation of that power.
2993200	2996200	But is it the idea that the ring gives you more imagination?
2996200	3002200	Or is it the ring that can focus your imagination so you need to be imaginative to use it right?
3002200	3005200	Because he could just shoot people with green blasts of energy and kill them.
3005200	3006200	And it works as well.
3006200	3007200	That is also sort of his imagination.
3007200	3008200	Whatever is commanded.
3008200	3012200	Also he could just cover himself with a green shield that protects him against damage.
3012200	3014200	So he could just do that the whole time.
3014200	3015200	He kind of does.
3015200	3018200	And DC suffers from this across the board.
3018200	3020200	I think it's beautiful that it's all overpowered.
3020200	3021200	All of these things are overpowered.
3021200	3024200	And that's why it's difficult for them to figure out how to make these things human.
3024200	3026200	But it is an amazing...
3026200	3029200	It's just an amazing currency to play with.
3029200	3030200	The idea of imagination.
3030200	3033200	And I like what they went with it because he had so much power.
3033200	3036200	The power of imagination that he eventually just went crazy.
3036200	3037200	Which I think is so interesting.
3037200	3038200	Well, yeah.
3038200	3039200	They're getting into...
3039200	3040200	I'm sure if I read every...
3040200	3043200	Like, Green Lantern obviously goes all the way...
3043200	3044200	Just don't watch the movie.
3044200	3045200	I only know him from the surface.
3045200	3048200	It's just like the guy with the green with the ring and the thing.
3048200	3049200	Sorry.
3049200	3055200	But just make a green Superman.
3055200	3060200	Spencer's point is about that I never...
3060200	3062200	And just to be clear, I don't hate Green Lantern.
3062200	3065200	You brought this on and then we talked about it.
3065200	3066200	And then we...
3066200	3067200	Like, I think it's...
3067200	3068200	I said, what do you think of Green Lantern?
3068200	3071200	But then you said something that I thought was interesting because I don't think this
3071200	3073200	stuff through enough.
3073200	3074200	But you said...
3074200	3080200	What you just said, DC characters, it's all like gods basically.
3080200	3081200	Yeah.
3081200	3082200	Unless you count Batman.
3082200	3083200	But there's...
3083200	3084200	Marvel characters...
3084200	3087200	DC characters are defined by one weakness.
3087200	3088200	They all have like a kryptonite.
3088200	3089200	Yes.
3089200	3092200	And then Marvel characters are...
3092200	3098200	They're all kind of in one sense or another regular Joes who have one power.
3098200	3099200	Yes.
3100200	3103200	That kind of like fucks up their life.
3103200	3104200	Exactly.
3104200	3106200	But if you look at it as like a 70s movie thing...
3106200	3107200	You're a superhero.
3107200	3108200	You cannot date.
3108200	3109200	Sorry.
3109200	3110200	No, it's okay.
3110200	3111200	I'm going to stop talking because I'm just going to keep talking.
3111200	3112200	No, it's okay.
3112200	3113200	No, come on.
3113200	3114200	You're Ptolemais.
3114200	3115200	I mean, we can't...
3115200	3117200	Look at it like in the 70s version, right?
3117200	3121200	So there's 70s films and there's films that come after that are just like archetypes.
3121200	3126200	But these things came at a time in our world that is much...
3126200	3129200	That is in the past long time ago.
3129200	3136200	So the idea of extending a human trait to its maximum was brand new and had never happened before.
3136200	3140200	So they weren't perceiving how this would need to be modified in the future.
3140200	3141200	They were...
3141200	3142200	They...
3142200	3147200	From a single individual that is a living person to the godlike power that they were given,
3147200	3151200	really expanded people's imagination and expanded like their experience of the world around them.
3151200	3153200	There was purpose to these things.
3153200	3155200	So it was this big thing and they still gave them that weakness.
3156200	3157200	Which I think is fascinating.
3157200	3158200	It's an interesting archetype.
3158200	3161200	And I don't think it holds up as well or as easily as today.
3161200	3163200	So I'm not arguing one against the other.
3163200	3165200	But these are fascinating...
3165200	3168200	I think they're fascinating like tools for storytelling.
3168200	3172200	And I think people don't quite understand like the lineage of where it came from even.
3172200	3176200	In the same way that people don't like 70s movies now because they're not great.
3176200	3179200	But they were really fascinating at the time when there were no rules.
3179200	3181200	Right, but are we supposed to look at them through that lens?
3181200	3185200	I guess when I watch a Woody Allen movie, I'm like part of my appreciation is,
3185200	3187200	he wasn't famous for being Woody Allen yet.
3187200	3191200	This is amazing that he put himself in a movie even though he's not sexy.
3191200	3194200	And he's like just decided to cast himself as the romantic lead.
3194200	3196200	Like that's hilarious.
3198200	3201200	I am looking at it through a cultural retro lens.
3201200	3203200	And his level of honesty was way too far.
3203200	3205200	Because if I look at it through a modern lens, I'm like,
3205200	3207200	I don't like Woody Allen movies anymore.
3207200	3208200	I don't know.
3208200	3210200	I just remember...
3210200	3213200	I'm fascinated by the idea that, like,
3213200	3217200	I fortunately have never had to be in an ambulance with EMTs.
3217200	3220200	But I like the idea that the EMTs that come and get you
3220200	3223200	might also have been cosplaying the night before.
3223200	3224200	Yes.
3224200	3227200	So let's get into your vocation because that's what's fascinating.
3227200	3229200	So I just learned in the green room for instance,
3229200	3231200	EMTs totally different from paramedics.
3231200	3233200	Not totally different, but different.
3233200	3234200	I always thought it was synonymous.
3234200	3237200	EMTs are alarmingly
3238200	3241200	close to a person that got out of high school
3241200	3244200	and wants to work with blood and guts for a living.
3244200	3247200	Not to knock your vocation, but actually to praise you
3247200	3249200	because it's a very low paying job.
3249200	3251200	Go ahead, you take it from here.
3251200	3255200	Well, first of all, thank you for saying I'm out of high school.
3255200	3257200	I'm actually 30 now, so I must look good.
3257200	3259200	Beyond that, yeah, it's true.
3259200	3264200	EMTs are basically considered a certificate
3265200	3269200	that you would get in a college setting.
3269200	3274200	But ultimately, our schooling and stuff is about six to nine months.
3274200	3277200	And there's even accelerator programs, which you can do it in like two.
3277200	3279200	I don't recommend that to anybody.
3279200	3282200	Imagine trying to understand all this information in two months
3282200	3283200	and really that's not even true.
3283200	3285200	I don't recommend that to the injured.
3285200	3288200	We're sending the guy out.
3288200	3291200	He's got his G-E-T and he took it weekend intensive.
3292200	3297200	That's exactly why I didn't do that, because in my opinion,
3297200	3300200	if your life is in my hands, the last thing you want to know
3300200	3303200	is I've been practicing this for the past four weeks.
3303200	3305200	Don't worry, you're going to be okay.
3305200	3307200	How do I do this again?
3307200	3308200	It's okay.
3308200	3311200	I've been doing this for every weekend for the past month.
3311200	3312200	You're good.
3312200	3315200	And you said an EMT's job is to stabilize.
3315200	3320200	You arrive at the scene, it's like tourniquets, splints, I don't know,
3320200	3321200	whatever, like...
3321200	3325200	Splinting, bleeding control, so tourniquets, breathing for people.
3325200	3327200	We actually are able to do that.
3327200	3328200	Like tracheotomies?
3328200	3330200	You ever have to punch a hole in the face?
3330200	3331200	No tricks.
3331200	3334200	We have the little masks that you put over people's faces
3334200	3337200	and you squeeze the bags, are able to breathe for them
3337200	3340200	until the paramedics come and can stick tubes down their throat
3340200	3341200	and intubate them.
3341200	3344200	Yeah, and the difference basically between EMT and paramedics.
3344200	3348200	So EMT, basically, we are their assistants, if you want to put it that way.
3348200	3349200	We assist them.
3349200	3350200	We're the nurses to their doctor.
3350200	3351200	Right.
3351200	3356200	And the paramedics spend a lot more time in school to get their medical license
3356200	3361200	and basically, as I said, our job is to stabilize the patient
3361200	3364200	to get them to the hospital in under 10 minutes, hopefully.
3364200	3368200	And in that time, once we get there, the nurses and the doctors and the ER
3368200	3372200	take over and they go ahead and make sure that you're able to revitalize the person.
3372200	3377200	So if a 911 call goes out, an EMT is a responder on that?
3378200	3380200	Yeah, so the EMT likely is the person driving.
3380200	3382200	The paramedic's going to be in the passenger seat
3382200	3385200	because he's got to be first to get out.
3385200	3386200	Or she.
3386200	3387200	Or she.
3387200	3388200	I apologize.
3388200	3389200	Yes.
3390200	3391200	She's gay.
3391200	3392200	She's gay.
3393200	3396200	Gender equality, this guy.
3396200	3400200	Dan's Marvel superpower is that he learned that he can high road you
3400200	3402200	without doing anything really that heroic at all.
3403200	3407200	Imagine harnessing the power to high road.
3411200	3415200	I thought you guys were married because I'm not racist.
3423200	3424200	But he has a weakness.
3424200	3425200	Yes.
3425200	3427200	I see race.
3428200	3430200	I can't stop seeing it.
3431200	3432200	It's everywhere.
3433200	3435200	You said you were from Kenya, right?
3442200	3446200	I'm basically like the last guy that deserves to say I'm Kenyan.
3451200	3452200	So let's get started.
3452200	3454200	You guys told me something.
3461200	3467200	And I want to honor your candor.
3467200	3470200	And I think people will understand this.
3470200	3474200	But you guys work in human plumbing for a living.
3474200	3479200	You show up and people are ripped apart.
3479200	3481200	People have things knocked off of them.
3481200	3485200	People are in various states of biological chaos and your job is to stabilize it.
3485200	3486200	What's that?
3486200	3487200	Different parts of decay.
3487200	3488200	Yeah.
3489200	3496200	And so you shared with me in the green room, you guys, among yourselves,
3496200	3500200	just as I think writers in writer's rooms go to some pretty dark places
3500200	3505200	that don't necessarily have anything to do with the jokes that end up in the big bang theory.
3505200	3511200	It's like you guys go to fucking dark, you said you got a YouTube video
3511200	3514200	that was like a private link to a YouTube video.
3514200	3518200	Basically our Christmas parties are who has the goriest pictures and who has the goriest stories.
3518200	3524200	It's not so much that we're like sick, sadistic people.
3524200	3526200	It's the fact that that's how we cope with it.
3526200	3531200	You have to basically make humor out of some of, I'm sorry to say,
3531200	3534200	somebody's darkest day or their family's darkest day
3534200	3537200	because you got to be able to come home and be like, I'm okay.
3537200	3538200	I'm going to be okay.
3538200	3540200	It gives you control over it.
3540200	3544200	It's a very uncontrollable circumstance that you're constantly inserting your head.
3544200	3545200	I can see all this stuff all day.
3545200	3547200	Go home and you'll be able to lay down and sleep at night.
3547200	3548200	Right.
3548200	3549200	Exactly.
3549200	3552200	And otherwise than that, I mean, loving Deadpool is my favorite character.
3552200	3553200	It does help.
3555200	3557200	Deadpool makes sense for an EMT.
3557200	3558200	Exactly.
3558200	3560200	You know, that's when people are really excited to see me.
3560200	3562200	I was cosplaying Deadpool this morning.
3562200	3563200	Now I'm here to help you.
3564200	3567200	So, because you guys told me, I mean, you were just, I don't know,
3567200	3569200	like, I don't even know why I bring it up again.
3569200	3573200	It was just like kind of fascinating watching your face, which like eight,
3573200	3577200	when you were describing, like you got this video and it was like this guy
3577200	3580200	that got like ground up or split apart or something.
3580200	3584200	And you're kind of like, like this sort of like, you might as well have been
3584200	3586200	talking about architecture.
3586200	3588200	I went this way, I went this way, head was that way.
3588200	3589200	Yeah.
3589200	3591200	That's basically, I mean, and that's how it is.
3591200	3595200	It's a point of why we kind of do our jobs because whether we're talking
3595200	3601200	about, yes, this video where a guy was going like 170 miles per hour on his
3601200	3602200	motorcycle.
3602200	3607200	And then next part in the video, well, his torso's here, his head is over there
3607200	3611200	and his legs are split apart like, you know, wishbones, except in the middle
3611200	3614200	are his pants that are holding the two feet.
3614200	3616200	So you can kind of nunchuck them, you know?
3618200	3621200	You know, it's funny to me because...
3621200	3623200	That's what I'm talking about.
3623200	3624200	Like, he's not a bad guy.
3624200	3626200	You know, he's a good guy.
3626200	3628200	It's like, whoa.
3628200	3632200	What the people who are only listening to this can't see is how turned on,
3632200	3634200	told me is right now.
3635200	3638200	I had that one in the chamber and...
3640200	3644200	I was like, this is going to be the easiest call back.
3645200	3647200	But there's other days that there's good stories.
3647200	3651200	So she actually had a really good story that happened not too long ago,
3652200	3653200	race track.
3653200	3654200	Oh, yeah.
3654200	3657200	So I'm part of a race team.
3657200	3658200	I don't know if anyone's ever heard of.
3658200	3659200	Chuck Waller Raceway.
3659200	3661200	It's way out in Desert Center.
3661200	3662200	It's a private race track.
3662200	3665200	We do private race teams.
3665200	3669200	Not even three weeks ago, I was out there.
3669200	3670200	It's usually super boring.
3670200	3673200	We lay there or we sit there waiting for something.
3674200	3675200	That was a union rule.
3675200	3676200	Yes.
3676200	3677200	We lay there.
3677200	3678200	We sit there.
3679200	3681200	No sleeping.
3681200	3684200	The stretchers are only for the clients.
3685200	3686200	This is true.
3686200	3687200	Very true.
3687200	3688200	Yeah.
3689200	3692200	So we were just sitting there waiting.
3692200	3697200	We wait for people to go down on their motorcycles or crash their cars into the different towers.
3697200	3699200	Which is exactly what the audience is waiting for.
3699200	3700200	Exactly.
3700200	3701200	Right?
3701200	3702200	Yeah.
3702200	3706200	So we're sitting there waiting and, like most of the day, it was biker down,
3707200	3708200	rider's down.
3708200	3709200	Okay, rider popped back up.
3709200	3710200	Back on his bike.
3710200	3711200	Let's go.
3711200	3714200	So we hear rider down, second rider down.
3714200	3715200	Okay.
3715200	3716200	Wait.
3716200	3717200	First rider's up.
3717200	3718200	Oh, shit.
3718200	3719200	Second rider's not moving.
3719200	3720200	Sorry.
3720200	3721200	Can I say that?
3721200	3722200	Yeah.
3722200	3723200	So second rider's not moving.
3723200	3724200	Oh, shit.
3724200	3725200	Oh, yeah.
3725200	3727200	You said nunchucks out of a man's life.
3730200	3731200	True.
3731200	3732200	True.
3732200	3733200	Yeah, I know.
3733200	3734200	You can say anything you want.
3734200	3735200	Okay.
3735200	3737200	Our second rider's not getting up.
3737200	3744200	So we flip on our license iron, shoot across the racetrack, get to him, and he's laying
3744200	3745200	face down.
3745200	3747200	And we're like, oh, crap.
3747200	3748200	Okay.
3748200	3749200	Well, we actually have to work today.
3749200	3750200	Yay.
3750200	3751200	No, it's a lot of fun.
3751200	3752200	But so we...
3752200	3755200	That was a heartwarming story.
3755200	3757200	You were right.
3757200	3760200	At first I thought, oh, these nunchucks.
3760200	3762200	That's a tough story.
3762200	3766200	But he went right to the heartwarmer.
3766200	3769200	She was like, oh, I get to work today.
3769200	3771200	No, I kid the injured.
3771200	3775200	I kid him because I love him.
3775200	3776200	Yeah.
3776200	3780200	So we're like, okay.
3780200	3781200	So we rock up.
3781200	3782200	He's face down or whatever.
3782200	3786200	We do our normal roll him over, support his airway, support his head.
3786200	3787200	We start taking off his clothes.
3787200	3790200	We have special leather cutters, start taking his helmet off.
3790200	3792200	And I was taking a helmet off.
3792200	3794200	We noticed that he's doing a weird thing.
3794200	3795200	We call guppy breathing.
3795200	3796200	So basically it's...
3796200	3801200	It waits a while.
3801200	3802200	Okay.
3802200	3803200	Okay.
3803200	3804200	Well, okay.
3804200	3807200	That obviously means he's not breathing, check pulses, no pulses.
3807200	3810200	So it's just me and my partner, me and a medic.
3810200	3812200	Just the two of us were like, crap.
3812200	3813200	Okay.
3813200	3815200	Fire department's 15 minutes away.
3815200	3818200	Helicopter's half an hour away.
3818200	3819200	Okay.
3819200	3820200	Well, here we go.
3820200	3825200	So we cut his leathers off, begin CPR, chest compressions, breathing for him.
3825200	3830000	The other rider that went down with him, unfortunately, had broke his arm.
3830000	3835600	So he's walking up like a flimsy wrist, like, guys, what do you need?
3835600	3837600	I'm ski patrol, but I can try to help.
3837600	3840480	Everybody's afraid of the T-Rex.
3840480	3842200	His name was ski patrol?
3842200	3845200	Are they like transformers?
3845200	3846200	Bad ass.
3847200	3850200	Keep a side winder.
3850200	3851200	Roll out.
3851200	3852200	Wheeljack.
3852200	3859200	So anyway, so we start through these compressions on him and we get to shock him, which, believe
3859200	3861200	it or not, is a very rare thing.
3861200	3865200	When someone has no heartbeat, we hardly ever shock them.
3865200	3867200	So we got to shock him.
3867200	3871200	After the third shock, we feel down, he has pulses.
3871200	3872200	We're like, yes.
3872200	3874200	By ourselves, just two of us.
3874200	3878200	No one, probably the most rewarding thing I've had in a couple of years.
3878200	3883200	Get him to a helicopter, by the time we get him to a helicopter, he's fighting us.
3883200	3885200	Fighting us is a good thing.
3885200	3887200	That means you're alive again and wanting to live.
3887200	3888200	Yeah, trying to...
3888200	3891200	Like throwing punches at you, like, get the fuck off me?
3891200	3892200	Yes.
3892200	3893200	Also, you ruined my pants.
3893200	3894200	You cut my goddamn leathers off.
3894200	3895200	Exactly.
3895200	3896200	Who cut my leathers?
3896200	3897200	You would be surprised.
3897200	3901700	A lot of people get really upset about us cutting their clothes off trying to save their
3901700	3902700	life.
3903700	3904700	Is that in a fugue state?
3904700	3905700	No, that's just...
3905700	3906700	Or do you mean that they actually...
3906700	3908700	Oh my god, you just cut my $100 pair of pants.
3908700	3909700	Fuck you.
3909700	3910700	What are you going to do?
3910700	3911700	Yeah.
3911700	3913700	I want that money back for that $100.
3913700	3917700	I mean, obviously, the leather he had on was multi-hundred dollars and he was fighting
3917700	3918700	us away.
3918700	3919700	We get him in the helicopter.
3919700	3920700	He's still fighting.
3920700	3921700	I'm like, leave me alone.
3921700	3922700	Leave me alone.
3922700	3924700	So that was extremely rewarding.
3924700	3925700	Yeah.
3927700	3928700	Leave me alone.
3928700	3929700	Leave me alone.
3929700	3930700	The end.
3930700	3933700	I could actually make a difference for once instead of just taking the person that stubbed
3933700	3939700	their toe or, believe it or not, woke up from a bad dream and is scared to be home alone.
3939700	3945260	So that brings to mind the question, it seems to me that there's two things that would bring
3945260	3946420	you to this job.
3946420	3952500	One is this altruistic thing that's like, oh my god, I love people, which is why a story
3952500	3955380	like that is so much more fulfilling for you.
3955380	3963740	I got to do the thing that I want to do today, which is actually do the zappy paddles and
3963740	3965940	bring somebody from dead to alive.
3965940	3969540	And if I hadn't been there, they'd be dead and now I feel good going to bed tonight.
3969540	3970540	Exactly.
3970540	3971540	If the two of us weren't there, then...
3971540	3973660	But that speaks to empathy.
3973660	3978060	And the other thing that makes you good at this job is the other thing we've seen, which
3978060	3984180	is that you're sociopaths, like that you guys can actually somehow, like you can deal with
3984180	3989020	that stuff without going, this is a human being, I can't handle looking at their innards.
3989020	3990020	Right.
3990020	3995700	Well, 90% of our job honestly is transporting patients from one hospital to another.
3995700	3997940	That's 90% of our job.
3997940	4004000	10% is actually going code three and having to show up at an actual...
4004000	4010140	Going code three and showing up at an emergency and of that 10%, probably only another 5%
4010140	4015980	of that is actually serious injury to a point where this is why I love my job, this is why
4015980	4016980	I do it.
4016980	4022060	Because yeah, we all initially do it because we care about people or we like the job we
4022060	4025820	do because as we told you, we don't get paid almost anything.
4025820	4028780	I'm talking about a little bit above minimum wage.
4028780	4029780	That's it.
4029780	4031100	Which I was kind of shocked by.
4031100	4032100	Yeah.
4032100	4033100	Good for you.
4033100	4034100	Good for you.
4034100	4035940	It's the same thing with...
4035940	4038460	Meaning that they're doing it as a...
4038460	4041480	This is not a job you go and get rich quick scheme.
4041480	4044100	Do people, does America need more EMTs?
4044100	4050180	We need more specifically paramedics because again, EMTs do help, but without the paramedic
4050180	4054020	because of the scope of practice, there are certain things we're not allowed to do even
4054020	4056260	if we know how.
4056260	4058300	If we do it, we're losing our license.
4058300	4064100	Because there's kind of a paramedic shortage and because there's money to be made therefore
4064100	4071740	by these paramedic schools, which correct me when I'm wrong, you pay $10,000 to...
4071740	4079820	If you're an EMT, you pay $10,000 like tuition to a school, do some schooling.
4079820	4087220	There's barriers between you and being a paramedic that represent money for schools that are
4087220	4090340	now rushing people into paramedicry.
4090340	4095500	Basically, you graduate EMT school, the next week they say, hey, give us $10,000, we'll
4095500	4097300	make you this paramedic.
4097300	4102860	Which is scary to think because this paramedic will go through two years of school, roughly,
4102860	4107940	and however, if he spent no time on a rig, this guy basically has spent...
4107940	4108940	Or she.
4108940	4109940	Or she.
4109940	4120300	This person, this person, this person now has to literally know how to help people.
4120300	4125700	People without ever actually helping a person in their whole career.
4125700	4127620	They might not know that they're squeamish.
4127620	4128620	Exactly.
4128620	4129620	It's happened.
4129620	4133100	They go all the way through school, they got to their first real scene and they're like,
4133100	4134100	I can't handle this.
4134100	4136620	But that's where the EMTs come in.
4136620	4141660	You have EMTs like me who've been doing this for eight years that take those new medics
4141660	4145260	and are able to babysit them.
4145260	4150180	But you're the nurse to their doctor and now you're no more qualified than them.
4151180	4155420	Trump's going to take care of this, right?
4155420	4156420	He's a businessman.
4156420	4157420	What do you do?
4157420	4158420	He'll build a wall.
4158420	4162980	He'll build a wall to put around the bodies.
4162980	4167300	If he could put a bigger wall between paramedic and EMT, maybe that would help.
4167300	4168300	I don't know.
4168300	4172780	The whole thing is I get it, everybody has to make their money.
4172780	4176700	You got to pay to be in a certain profession, no matter what profession it is.
4176700	4177940	Originally I wanted to be an actor.
4177940	4181300	There's still money I got to pay to go to school and do that.
4181300	4187260	However, point is, yes, it's those provisions put in the place where you have to do usually
4187260	4191300	a thousand hours being an EMT before you can even become a paramedic and that's really
4191300	4196140	important for the safety of the population as well as the safety of us.
4196140	4202820	And again, it's not a pity party to say that, yeah, we would like some more money and this
4202820	4203820	and that.
4203820	4205980	But again, we do our jobs because we enjoy them.
4205980	4208660	However, you know, we have our bad days too.
4208660	4213420	Even today, unfortunately, one of my divisions, which guys, this is really important, I bring
4213420	4219700	it up because it's sad to me, but we watched it the other day and sure enough today things
4219700	4220780	went wrong.
4220780	4223220	When we go code three, guys, pull over.
4223220	4224220	Please pull over.
4224220	4225220	To the left.
4225220	4226220	Code three means lights and sirens.
4226220	4228260	Code three means lights and sirens because today...
4228260	4229900	Wait, what does pull over to the left mean?
4229900	4230900	That seems important.
4230900	4231980	Pull to the left side of the road.
4231980	4233940	Do not pull to the right because we drive.
4233940	4235260	I think you're getting that backwards.
4235700	4236700	Yes.
4236700	4237700	Oh, okay.
4237700	4238700	You're on board.
4238700	4239700	Everybody put married.
4239700	4242700	Park perpendicularly perpendicularly over the road.
4242700	4243700	Pull to the right.
4243700	4248860	Pull to the right side of the road because we drive on the left side of the road.
4248860	4249860	Yeah.
4249860	4253060	Just like you see any cops or anything else and please just double check your mirrors.
4253060	4260620	Unfortunately today, a SUV went head on with one of my division's rigs and we had to fly
4260620	4265900	out our paramedic and they were already on, as I said, code three going to a scene and
4265900	4269340	unfortunately they had to be flown out to a trauma center.
4269340	4272860	So that also means the scene they were going to, they had to, it took longer for them to
4272860	4277260	get there because they had to send a second ambulance along with an ambulance to the accident.
4277260	4278260	Yeah.
4278260	4279260	And the system...
4279260	4280260	You okay?
4280260	4282260	I have a horrible joke.
4282260	4283260	Go ahead.
4283260	4284260	All right.
4284260	4289060	I just don't know if you guys show pictures of that paramedic at the party.
4289060	4293980	That's going to be up to the paramedic.
4293980	4295940	Or is that like too personal?
4295940	4301780	Understand, whenever we show pictures, we make sure first and foremost that because
4301780	4304980	of HIPAA laws and stuff, we don't state names, we don't take pictures of the person's face
4304980	4305980	and stuff like that.
4305980	4306980	So usually it's the...
4306980	4307980	Nothing identifying.
4307980	4309780	Usually it's the wreckage of the car and...
4309780	4310780	Yeah.
4310780	4311780	Or...
4311780	4312780	Yeah.
4312780	4314780	Or if it's a body part that's by itself, you really can't tell who that is but...
4314780	4315780	Yeah.
4315780	4316780	I don't know.
4317500	4319500	I...
4319500	4320500	But the...
4320500	4323500	You ever see somebody just dick fly off?
4323500	4324500	Actually, yes.
4324500	4325500	You should see...
4325500	4326500	Actually, yes.
4326500	4327500	Actually, yes.
4327500	4328500	Just their dick.
4328500	4329500	Wait.
4329500	4330500	Okay.
4330500	4331500	Let's be clear.
4331500	4332500	Let's be clear.
4332500	4335420	I work in Palm Springs, so...
4335420	4336420	Dicks are flying.
4336420	4337420	Yes.
4337420	4340860	The dick mutilation capital of the world.
4340860	4341860	Yes.
4341860	4345780	So, dick injuries are very common for me.
4346780	4350060	I'm kind of curious about your own personal injuries.
4350060	4352060	Do you guys ever...
4352060	4357300	Like, if you are the way you are and you're able to be comfortable with other people's
4357300	4360580	injuries, does that make you a little bit like a super person?
4360580	4366100	Like if you're working on a bandsaw and you lose your pinky, are you less dizzy?
4366100	4367580	Actually, knock on wood.
4367580	4369980	I've never broken a bone in my body.
4369980	4372900	And as far as injuries go, yeah.
4372900	4376780	I look at myself and I say, you know, hey, you know, pain's gonna come, things happen.
4376780	4381260	But if you're telling me, yeah, if I bandsaw my hand, no, I'm screaming like a little girl.
4381260	4382260	Oh, my God!
4382260	4383260	I know, look at that.
4383260	4384260	Or a little boy.
4384260	4385260	Or a little boy.
4385260	4386260	Non-stop.
4386260	4389260	I'm screaming like a baby.
4389260	4394980	But what about your kids?
4394980	4395980	You had two kids, right?
4395980	4396980	I have three total.
4396980	4397980	Three total.
4397980	4400980	So, one of each.
4401980	4403980	Wait, I didn't even...
4403980	4404980	This is true.
4404980	4405980	Wait.
4405980	4417260	I'm gonna actually need to go back over that afterwards, but have the kid ever just fallen
4417260	4420980	on their face or like under his blood and everything and like...
4420980	4427860	Actually the first time that I've ever had to do anything that was medically induced
4427860	4431140	help was my first child.
4431140	4434940	Me being the wonderful father I am, I was a county change on the bed and he got a hold
4434940	4440780	of a quarter when I walked out of the room and swallowed the quarter partially.
4440780	4447100	And I had to do back thrusts and kind of the Heimlich maneuver while he's actively vomiting
4447100	4448100	everywhere.
4448100	4454620	And that's the only thing that kept me happy is if he's vomiting, there's airway.
4454620	4458820	But eventually a quarter popped out before we had to go to the hospital, so I was very
4458820	4463860	thankful for that and that's the only thing I've done so far.
4463860	4466100	Starburn's my studio.
4466100	4475740	Dino and I had lunch with our CFO, our head accountant, a pleasant Mormon fella who we
4475740	4479340	had hired to turn our business around for us.
4479340	4488260	And we were talking to him about, you know, we should get health benefits for all of everybody
4488260	4489580	and it's so great that you're here.
4489580	4490580	Thank you so much.
4490580	4494900	And then he started choking on his skirt steak that he was eating.
4494900	4499660	And Dino and I just kind of like sat there.
4499660	4503460	It was like an out of body experience, but with it where you don't...
4503460	4504460	I wasn't doing...
4504460	4505820	I was looking at myself doing nothing.
4505820	4510060	He was like, why are you choking on my dinner table?
4510060	4511060	Stop that.
4511060	4515460	In the 70s, it seemed like there was a movement to teach people about the Heimlich, you know,
4515460	4516620	there was like a big movement.
4516620	4517620	That's why.
4517620	4518620	This is like...
4518620	4523820	Is there anything you could just verbally impart to me when I said...
4523820	4530620	Because I know the general idea is I know I shouldn't sit there, but I mean, I don't
4530620	4531620	know.
4531620	4532620	Did he die?
4532620	4534460	No, he just...
4534460	4536340	He stood up out of the booth.
4536340	4541100	Dino and I were still sitting.
4541100	4546820	We were so slow in reacting that the bartender at Little Dom's made it all the way around
4546820	4550540	the bar and said, are you okay?
4550540	4555260	As he finally barfed up a little piece of steak onto the floor.
4555260	4558420	And Dino and I were still sitting.
4558420	4559420	And I just looked back.
4559420	4562180	I was like, that's the day I learned I'm a fucking horrible...
4563180	4568220	I got to change something, but I won't, right?
4568220	4569220	My only...
4569220	4571380	I don't want to be...
4571380	4573180	I didn't do anything.
4573180	4578620	But that's like, this is what the Marvel universe is, right?
4578620	4582540	Like it's a hundred percent weaknesses, but one gender power.
4582540	4583540	And that's...
4583540	4589460	Yeah, I have the ability to proclaim myself feminist, that's it.
4589460	4594860	If a woman is choking, I'll just be like, I don't know what to tell you.
4594860	4598100	If they have a historic election dangled in front of them and then snatched away, I'll
4598100	4601780	just be like, all right, take it easy.
4601780	4606260	I think I told this story before, but I almost died on a corn dog at Wiener Schnitzel in
4606260	4607260	high school.
4607260	4609740	And I was like, oh, fuck it, this is how I die.
4609740	4614740	I die on a fucking corn dog because trying to get a bite of the corn dog and I bit too
4614740	4615740	much.
4615740	4616980	And the guy did a joke of giving me more than I wanted.
4616980	4621180	So I got the whole corn dog and I bit it off and I got a corn dog in my throat.
4621180	4622180	And I just...
4622180	4626660	And everyone just sat there and I'm dying and I can't breathe at all.
4626660	4627660	You can't swallow it.
4627660	4628660	It's not coming back up.
4628660	4630220	There's no way to get a hand on it.
4630220	4634420	And my friend, Brandon Morgan, who we call Bam-Bam, because he was just really strong,
4634420	4637940	he just fucking picked me up by the ankles and shook it on out.
4637940	4640300	He's like, he fucking...
4640300	4644460	He got it done.
4644460	4646020	How tall was Bam-Bam?
4646020	4648700	Just because you buy the ankles.
4648700	4649700	I was little.
4649700	4653420	I was like five foot four when I was like a freshman in high school.
4653420	4657380	Bam-Bam, he was my best friend.
4657380	4662780	Everything on my shitty Volkswagen Chiraco, my 81 Chiraco, I love that car, but it was
4662780	4663780	a piece of garbage.
4663780	4667580	And everything on the passenger side, because Bam-Bam was always in there, everything was
4667580	4668580	broken.
4668580	4671540	He would just close the door and the handle would come off in his hand.
4671540	4674780	All the knobs, anything that he could touch on his side was off.
4674780	4678740	So we had to get in and out of that side of the car like the General Lee, like you had
4678740	4679740	to fucking...
4679740	4688260	All right, well, Alan and Katrina, thank you so much for sharing your lives with us.
4688260	4699220	So you're living together and there's a will-they-won't-they going on there, but it's not...
4699220	4702740	The living situation comes down to California prices.
4702740	4703740	Yeah.
4703740	4704740	But it's just amazing.
4704740	4707060	I was talking to you in the green room and I became kind of ashamed of myself because
4707060	4711980	I'm like, you guys watching Westworld and your answer had so much to do with, well,
4711980	4718460	once a year when HBO has a package for $10 less, it's like you guys are living hand-to-mouth
4718460	4723900	and then you're just showing up whenever everybody else who's like, I don't know, it's just kind
4723900	4724900	of fucked up.
4724900	4728020	We should pay teachers more, we should pay cops more, we should pay EMTs more, we should
4728020	4734460	pay everybody more, but like, I don't know, maybe we can have some Harman Town scholarship
4734460	4740140	to make sure you guys make it to the paramedic level where I'm sure it's like $8 an hour.
4740140	4741140	Right.
4741140	4742140	I'll...
4742140	4745620	We'll figure it out.
4745620	4749300	I feel like I might have put more into the Big Bang Theory slot machine than you guys
4749300	4752660	need to like get up to...
4752660	4757060	There was a Kickstarter that happened because somebody stole your glass that James made.
4757060	4763460	It was like, we should do Kickstarters for just people that don't barf when they see
4763460	4765460	your dick fly off.
4765460	4770740	Yes, we should, we should.
4770740	4773900	That's kind of a rough pitch, but you got the idea.
4773900	4777260	So everybody pull over when you, for ambulance...
4777260	4782900	Pull over to the left and the right if you just do a series of figure eights.
4782900	4786100	Even if you just at least stop, just stop.
4786100	4789220	Just let us move around you, go around you, something of that nature.
4789220	4792580	I'll start stopping when you start spelling words in the right direction.
4792580	4793580	Right.
4793580	4796460	Fucking spell the shit backwards.
4796460	4799620	They're anticipating your backwards viewing of it.
4799620	4800620	Right.
4800620	4806260	All right, well, so if you guys don't mind saying goodbye to the...
4806260	4807260	Let's thank Katrina and Alan.
4807260	4810260	Alan, you can go back in the holding tank.
4811260	4812260	I'm not very good at running the show.
4812260	4813260	Oh, that was good.
4813260	4814260	There's more people I wanted to meet.
4814260	4815260	I can't believe we missed 9-11 when we had EMTs out here.
4815260	4816260	That was sad.
4816260	4817260	I saw it, I saw it, but...
4817260	4818260	You saw it?
4818260	4819260	You son of a bitch.
4819260	4820260	Oh yeah, you just issued that much restraint.
4820260	4821260	Yeah.
4821260	4822260	Yeah.
4822260	4823260	Maybe explain 9-11.
4823260	4824260	That was a missed opportunity?
4824260	4825260	He'll be fine.
4825260	4826260	Speaking of 9-11, you know, I was at the...
4826260	4827260	I was at the...
4827260	4828260	I was at the...
4828260	4829260	I was at the...
4829260	4830260	I was at the...
4830260	4831260	I was at the...
4831260	4832260	I was at the...
4832260	4833260	I was at the...
4833260	4834260	I was at the...
4834260	4835260	I was at the...
4835260	4836260	I was at the...
4836260	4837260	I was at the...
4838260	4839260	He'll be fine.
4839260	4844420	Speaking of 9-11, you know, I was at the Las Vegas airport today, and the TSA, like, slowed
4844420	4850260	to a crawl and, like, detained Cody and I, and, like, I was getting so cranky, and, like,
4850260	4851260	I was...
4851260	4853260	I'm gonna miss the show, and I'm so pissed.
4853260	4854260	Fucking TSA.
4854260	4855260	Fuck the TSA.
4855260	4856260	These fucking assholes.
4856260	4857260	Like, look at them.
4857260	4858260	Like, blah, blah, blah.
4858260	4864260	But it turns out, like, we were slowed down because both Cody and I were carrying knives.
4865260	4868260	From Death Valley that I bought...
4868260	4874260	I bought at a store a knife that said Cody and a knife that said Dan, and we had them
4874260	4877260	in our luggage, and they got both of us.
4877260	4883260	And I was like, we had flown from Los Angeles to Las Vegas with those knives.
4883260	4886260	So, congratulations Las Vegas TSA.
4886260	4889260	I was like, you went from being my least favorite people to...
4889260	4892260	Because I don't want to be on a plane if you can get on there with a knife.
4892260	4893260	I didn't know I had the knife.
4893260	4895260	I had fucking knives.
4895260	4896260	Anyways...
4896260	4897260	Wait, did you lose them?
4897260	4898260	Did you have to surrender your knife?
4898260	4899260	Yeah, we had to throw them away.
4899260	4901260	I mean, they had $10 knives, but...
4901260	4902260	You can.
4902260	4904260	No, you can, but, I mean, come on.
4904260	4906260	It's all terrible.
4906260	4910260	The knives were $10 at a gift store, and, you know, I don't know.
4910260	4912260	I just, like, we were late for our...
4912260	4913260	We weren't late, but I'm lazy.
4913260	4915260	I don't want to fill out a form.
4915260	4917260	Then you get, like, junk mail, I'm sure, from the TSA.
4917260	4922260	And they're like, hey, ask about our condo deals.
4922260	4924260	Well, what were you going to say?
4924260	4929260	So my dad had me a knife in Alaska, and I was flying from Alaska with the knife.
4929260	4930260	Uh-huh.
4930260	4933260	And then they wouldn't let me fly with it.
4933260	4935260	It was this big, and it had a wolf on it.
4935260	4936260	It was really cute.
4936260	4940260	But you can, if it's precious, you can have it mailed.
4940260	4942260	I spent my last $12.
4942260	4943260	Oh, shit.
4943260	4944260	I mailed it to myself.
4944260	4945260	Well, here.
4945260	4949260	Wait, this I can solve.
4949260	4950260	Wait, you wouldn't?
4950260	4951260	I was in Vegas.
4951260	4954260	You're going to pay here for the knife, but you're not going to pay the EMTs,
4954260	4957260	because I can't afford HBO.
4957260	4960260	I don't have $10,000 in my pocket.
4960260	4962260	I have $1,000.
4962260	4964260	You could have bought them an HBO subscription.
4964260	4965260	Oh, that's true.
4965260	4967260	Well, this is for them, okay.
4967260	4968260	$100.
4968260	4970260	I'll pretend I spent a big bang for you.
4970260	4971260	Who else is in hard times right now?
4971260	4972260	Dan's handing out money.
4972260	4979260	Anybody?
4979260	4983260	I really have an ATM here.
4983260	4985260	I spent my last $120.
4985260	4992260	Oh, shit.
4992260	4993260	Well, wait.
4993260	4996260	There's other people I wanted to...
4996260	4997260	Oh, yeah.
4997260	4998260	Yeah.
4998260	5000260	Now he's got guests to bring out.
5000260	5001260	Yeah.
5001260	5004260	Who's the guy that was tweeting the...
5004260	5005260	He's here.
5005260	5009260	I saw him put up a sign towards the front of the stage.
5009260	5010260	All right.
5010260	5011260	Human Party Guy?
5011260	5012260	Yes.
5012260	5013260	Okay.
5013260	5014260	Come on up.
5014260	5017260	Human Party, stranger.
5017260	5020260	Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O.
5020260	5021260	Hello.
5021260	5022260	Oh, hello.
5022260	5023260	You are...
5023260	5024260	Yeah, hello.
5024260	5025260	Hello.
5025260	5026260	This is on purpose.
5026260	5027260	This is strategic.
5027260	5028260	Here you go.
5028260	5029260	Oh, thank you.
5029260	5031260	Okay, there's a gentleman in a kilt and a t-shirt handing out gifts.
5031260	5032260	This is a Las Vegas flask.
5032260	5034260	Can you please tell them how attractive I am?
5034260	5036260	Just hot as a goddamn pistol.
5036260	5038260	He's got all sorts of labels on his back.
5038260	5039260	What do we have here?
5039260	5040260	Something great.
5040260	5041260	You're handing me a vape?
5041260	5042260	This is weed?
5042260	5043260	Yep.
5043260	5044260	This is some sort of...
5044260	5045260	I'm just gonna give it to Dan, but I want to give it to you.
5045260	5046260	What's your name, sir?
5046260	5047260	My name is John Roswell.
5047260	5048260	John Roswell?
5048260	5049260	No.
5049260	5050260	And what did you bring for me?
5050260	5056260	I actually was gonna bring you my luckiest 20.
5056260	5058260	But then I was gonna do that.
5058260	5060260	Give him a spencer, because he's...
5060260	5061260	No, no, no.
5061260	5062260	I'm fine.
5062260	5064260	I'm not a real vape-y, weed-y type.
5064260	5066260	You could use it better than me.
5066260	5067260	All right.
5067260	5069260	No, I still want it.
5069260	5072260	If you're not giving a dispenser.
5072260	5074260	I want the show, wait till it cuts away from you,
5074260	5075260	and nobody's gonna know a thing.
5075260	5076260	All right.
5076260	5078260	Chris, are you about to just sell us real estate,
5078260	5079260	or what's happening here?
5079260	5080260	More or less.
5080260	5082260	I'm gonna kill it for real estate, no.
5082260	5084260	He's got a kilt on.
5084260	5085260	Well, grab a mic.
5085260	5086260	Yeah.
5086260	5087260	Eat the mic.
5087260	5088260	Eat the mic.
5088260	5089260	Yeah.
5089260	5091260	So, you might crush my dream tonight.
5091260	5096260	So, before anything happens, which camera's on?
5096260	5097260	Just the red light.
5097260	5098260	Look at the red light.
5098260	5099260	Baby, I love you.
5099260	5100260	I love you so much.
5100260	5102260	My beautiful wife, Heather, got me here.
5102260	5105260	And my son, D'Artagnan, this is for you.
5105260	5106260	Maybe...
5106260	5108260	Are you in the agency with his dad?
5108260	5109260	No, you can go.
5109260	5111260	This is gonna get weird, so...
5111260	5112260	It's already weird.
5112260	5113260	Yeah.
5117260	5119260	Don't dismiss my guests.
5120260	5123260	Now, Dan, I even have props, but we'll see if we get to that.
5123260	5124260	All right.
5124260	5125260	The poster that was brought up.
5125260	5126260	Right.
5126260	5128260	So, how do you want me to do this, Dan?
5128260	5130260	Well, I mean, I'll say the back story.
5130260	5132260	I feel like you're prepared, right?
5132260	5133260	What's that?
5133260	5135260	You seem very prepared for what's about to happen.
5135260	5136260	Yeah, if you wanna just take it.
5136260	5137260	Okay, well, let me...
5137260	5138260	I can get the back story, which is...
5138260	5139260	Do you wanna sit, or do you wanna stalk the stage
5139260	5140260	like a panther the whole time?
5140260	5141260	Oh, my God.
5141260	5142260	All right.
5142260	5143260	All right.
5143260	5144260	I've never done anything like this before in my life.
5144260	5145260	I would give you all...
5145260	5148260	There's about a 50-50 chance I throw up on you people, okay?
5148260	5149260	Sure.
5149260	5150260	I've never been on stage.
5150260	5151260	I've never...
5151260	5152260	I didn't do drama.
5152260	5154260	I don't have a script I'm trying to sell.
5154260	5155260	It's fine.
5155260	5156260	I'm not a failed actor.
5156260	5158260	I live in Washington.
5158260	5160260	Getting here was insane.
5160260	5161260	I flew just for this.
5161260	5162260	Oh, God.
5162260	5163260	Because you finally told me.
5163260	5164260	Give it a shot.
5164260	5165260	I'll bring you in.
5165260	5166260	Oh, hold on.
5166260	5167260	I've got...
5167260	5168260	Hold on.
5168260	5169260	Oh, and I'm gonna start a Kickstarter,
5169260	5171260	and this shirt is gonna be on there.
5171260	5173260	It's very important to what I'm doing.
5173260	5174260	All right.
5174260	5175260	Basically, my point is we're all...
5175260	5177260	We still need the mic, though.
5177260	5178260	I'll get the mic back.
5178260	5179260	I'll get the mic back.
5179260	5180260	I promise.
5180260	5182260	Let's just tear the show up real quick.
5182260	5183260	All right.
5183260	5184260	This is for you.
5184260	5185260	Okay.
5185260	5186260	This show has become...
5186260	5187260	This is my character show.
5187260	5188260	A...
5188260	5191260	Let's become Charles Manson's Shark Tank.
5191260	5192260	Yes!
5192260	5197260	What I'm proposing is Kool-Aid.
5197260	5199260	I'll eat this one, I guess.
5199260	5200260	You know what?
5200260	5201260	That's closer.
5201260	5202260	That's a better mic.
5202260	5203260	I like that.
5203260	5204260	Let me see.
5204260	5206260	I've been sitting back there nervously.
5206260	5207260	I love this show,
5207260	5209260	and I've never hated a show more than this one.
5209260	5210260	How do I follow those guys?
5210260	5213260	Oh, well, not by insulting the show traditionally,
5213260	5215260	but either way.
5215260	5217260	No, the show is beautiful.
5217260	5218260	You're beautiful.
5218260	5221260	I love you for how you show us all your soul,
5221260	5223260	and we see how wonderful a person you are.
5223260	5225260	I love him for his logic.
5225260	5226260	Thank you.
5226260	5228260	I love you for keeping shit going.
5228260	5229260	Fuck, yeah.
5229260	5230260	And everybody that knows me...
5230260	5232260	Everybody at home that knows me is now saying,
5232260	5234260	fuck, he's doing the seven-to-one rule,
5234260	5235260	and sorry, guys.
5235260	5236260	What is the seven-to-one rule?
5236260	5237260	Oh.
5237260	5238260	Oh, shit.
5238260	5239260	It's not even on subject.
5239260	5240260	Weirdest part.
5240260	5241260	Jesus Christ.
5241260	5242260	All right, well, now let's look at that.
5242260	5243260	Jesus Christ.
5243260	5244260	Seven-to-one rule is basically
5244260	5245260	it's a management thing
5245260	5246260	where you're supposed to give people
5246260	5249260	seven compliments to one negative.
5249260	5251260	Ooh, here comes the one.
5251260	5252260	I'm saving that for...
5252260	5253260	All right, threw that in earlier.
5253260	5254260	We already got the one.
5254260	5256260	Yeah, he let off with the one.
5256260	5257260	Yeah, yeah.
5257260	5258260	He's making...
5258260	5259260	All right, so it's four people up here.
5259260	5260260	You can add me to the seven.
5260260	5261260	You got, like, a whole seven.
5261260	5262260	I was hoping...
5262260	5264260	I was hoping for a no-guess night.
5264260	5265260	I really was.
5265260	5266260	I bet.
5266260	5267260	Wow.
5267260	5268260	I was not...
5268260	5269260	I was not uncomfortable...
5269260	5270260	I heard the sword.
5270260	5271260	Until just now.
5271260	5272260	It's already...
5272260	5273260	I was like,
5273260	5274260	thank God I'm still here.
5274260	5275260	The paramedics leave,
5275260	5276260	and I'm like,
5276260	5277260	oh, Dan still wants me on stage.
5277260	5278260	Like, no, the paramedics are the lucky ones.
5278260	5279260	Yep.
5279260	5280260	Oh, yeah.
5280260	5281260	I'm sitting over there,
5281260	5282260	and I'm just going,
5282260	5283260	oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God,
5283260	5284260	oh, my God, oh, my God,
5284260	5285260	my dream is dying.
5285260	5286260	Oh, my God.
5286260	5287260	They're EMTs, by the way.
5287260	5288260	Do you want me to go?
5288260	5289260	No.
5289260	5290260	I will go.
5290260	5291260	I love you.
5291260	5292260	I love you.
5292260	5293260	I love your shirt.
5293260	5294260	I love you.
5294260	5295260	I love your shirt.
5295260	5296260	Okay.
5296260	5297260	But he's right.
5297260	5298260	Nobody cares about you on the show,
5298260	5299260	but I love your shirt.
5299260	5300260	Okay.
5300260	5301260	That's just a carryover from him.
5301260	5302260	That's okay.
5302260	5303260	I still have my slab wife.
5303260	5304260	Yes.
5304260	5305260	Yes.
5305260	5306260	Jesus.
5306260	5307260	You called her that, not me.
5307260	5308260	You called her slab lady.
5308260	5309260	No, I know.
5309260	5310260	You called her slab lady.
5310260	5311260	I said that people...
5311260	5312260	He said he heard it.
5312260	5313260	People, that's like,
5313260	5314260	you learned that from Trump.
5314260	5317260	That's like, people call her slab lady.
5317260	5318260	That's the same.
5318260	5319260	Why would they call her that?
5319260	5321260	She doesn't like laying on slabs all the time.
5321260	5322260	You're right.
5322260	5323260	You're right.
5323260	5324260	Yeah.
5324260	5325260	You, I distracted.
5325260	5326260	You're right.
5326260	5327260	There should not have been a guest.
5327260	5328260	No, no, no, no.
5328260	5329260	You...
5329260	5330260	You're watching my dream.
5330260	5332260	My dream is doing this as you go.
5332260	5333260	No, no, no.
5333260	5334260	It's true.
5334260	5336260	My dream has been hours traveling here, it sounds.
5336260	5337260	Oh my God.
5337260	5339260	My bus broke down on the way to the airport.
5339260	5342260	The number of times you probably went through the show on the journey.
5342260	5343260	Right.
5343260	5344260	Like over and over and none of them...
5344260	5345260	Suddenly there's some people on the plane going like this.
5345260	5346260	Yeah.
5346260	5347260	Oh my God.
5347260	5348260	Oh my fucking God.
5348260	5349260	Oh my God.
5349260	5350260	People are going to say this,
5350260	5351260	and not one of them had this guy in your dream.
5351260	5352260	Oh yeah.
5352260	5353260	He announces you and I love you.
5353260	5354260	Sean, I'm like fuck.
5354260	5355260	Fuck that guy.
5355260	5359760	And he said, you said this story about 20 minutes ago and I'm thinking, oh my God, great.
5359760	5363260	And then he brings paramedics out and I'm like, I can't compete with paramedics.
5363260	5364260	EMT.
5364260	5365260	Sorry.
5365260	5366260	Sorry.
5366260	5367260	Yeah.
5367260	5368260	Well, let's get into it.
5368260	5369260	All right.
5369260	5370260	You want to get into it?
5370260	5371260	Well, yes.
5371260	5372260	All right.
5372260	5373260	All right.
5373260	5374260	How did this come about then?
5374260	5375260	What qualified John here?
5375260	5376260	Well, John started as John.
5376260	5377260	Correct, John.
5377260	5382260	In case anyone else is also interested in this kind of thing, you could just tweet at
5382260	5383260	us.
5383260	5384260	No, don't say that.
5384260	5385260	Don't say that.
5385260	5386260	That's just what happened.
5386260	5389260	So he tweeted at us and now he's here.
5389260	5390260	Right.
5390260	5391260	I don't know.
5391260	5395660	He tweeted and I would say the adverb, hopefully it's not an offensive adverb incessantly.
5395660	5396660	You tweeted incessantly.
5396660	5397660	Here, here, here.
5397660	5398660	I'll just hold it.
5398660	5399660	I'll hold it.
5399660	5400660	No, you can't hold it.
5400660	5401660	Oh yeah.
5401660	5402660	Put it in front of him.
5402660	5403660	He's not necessary.
5403660	5404660	Don't poke him with that.
5404660	5405660	Careful with that.
5406660	5411660	He's like a, he's like a dead body in the back of one of his scenes right there.
5411660	5412660	Needlessly hostile.
5412660	5417160	Oh, I'm on the edge of my fucking seat right now.
5417160	5418660	I have no idea.
5418660	5421660	I have no idea what on earth is happening.
5421660	5422660	All right.
5422660	5423660	He's a crazy person.
5423660	5426660	He's going to kill all of us.
5426660	5427660	All right.
5427660	5428660	Oh, okay.
5428660	5429660	Jesus.
5429660	5430660	Oh no.
5430660	5431660	I fucked your dreams.
5431660	5433660	I fucked your dreams.
5434660	5437660	This is just like, where's my list of things I need from Dan at the end.
5437660	5438660	I think that's a mind map.
5438660	5439660	I like that.
5439660	5440660	Yeah.
5440660	5441660	Well, I had to convert.
5441660	5442660	Sorry.
5442660	5443660	All right.
5443660	5444660	I'm sorry.
5444660	5445660	Okay.
5445660	5449860	The first thing everybody has to remember, human party on Facebook, human party on Facebook.
5449860	5451860	I'm starting a new political party.
5451860	5452860	Okay.
5452860	5454860	So third, a political third party.
5454860	5455860	Yes.
5455860	5456860	Go ahead.
5456860	5461980	Oh, that's central to your, that's central to your platform is it needs to be a third
5461980	5462980	party.
5462980	5463980	Okay.
5463980	5464980	Continue.
5464980	5465980	That's all right.
5465980	5466980	These are the things we're going to go do.
5466980	5467980	Oh my God.
5467980	5469980	I've been sitting over there and now it's all gone.
5469980	5470980	Dan.
5470980	5471980	All right.
5471980	5478940	What I need, here is my goal, Dan is I'm, these are the things we're going to do.
5478940	5483660	These are the platform I've given him because he and I are discussing it seriously.
5483660	5489180	But here's the key for you is we live in a culture of personality we have for a long
5489180	5490180	time.
5490180	5494220	First Trump, my friends have been sick of hearing about it for 20 years, 20 years.
5494220	5495980	I've been a socialist Democrat.
5495980	5497900	I believe these things.
5497900	5507100	I am really doing this because, you know, my son is 17 and I would say he's ashamed
5507100	5508100	of me.
5508100	5513620	He's known my entire life that I've wanted to fix this country for another 20 minutes.
5513620	5514620	Yes.
5514620	5515620	I love that guy.
5515620	5516620	I love that.
5516620	5517620	That's start.
5517620	5518620	It won't happen.
5519060	5522180	I don't know what that's accomplishing, by the way.
5522180	5526980	So, yeah, I don't want to bore you guys and I'm sorry, Dan, Dan just was kind of questioning
5526980	5530220	whether this was serious because I sounded like a dork.
5530220	5531900	You know, he's like, what's this going to be?
5531900	5532980	It is serious.
5532980	5538420	Here's what I need you for, Dan is I am going to tell stars.
5538420	5540900	I'm going to start Twitter Wars with stars.
5540900	5542500	You were my first domino.
5542500	5543900	You were my concept.
5543900	5545220	Wait, Twitter Wars?
5545220	5546220	Yeah.
5546220	5547220	Okay.
5547220	5548220	Well, let's let's explore that.
5548220	5549220	Okay.
5549220	5550580	What do these Twitter Wars do?
5550580	5551580	Okay.
5551580	5552580	What?
5552580	5553780	So we live in a world of Twitter.
5553780	5554780	Yeah.
5554780	5555780	Yeah.
5555780	5556780	Okay.
5556780	5557780	Trump proved it.
5557780	5558780	Sure.
5558780	5559780	I think stars are part of the problem.
5559780	5564020	The ultra liberal stars think that something's being accomplished by them getting likes on
5564020	5566620	their tweets or by them throwing a dinner for someone.
5566620	5567620	Sure.
5567620	5568620	And I've got a list of 20 stars.
5568620	5572020	I think I handed it to you that that it's okay.
5572020	5573020	It's okay.
5573020	5574020	Don't.
5574020	5575020	Don't.
5575020	5576020	Don't.
5576020	5577020	I know.
5577020	5578020	I'm sorry, guys.
5579020	5580020	Okay.
5580020	5581020	No, it'll pay off.
5581020	5582020	No, don't do it.
5582020	5583020	Don't.
5583020	5584020	Oh, it's too early.
5584020	5585020	Oh no.
5585020	5586020	This is cool.
5586020	5587020	All right.
5587020	5588020	Number one.
5588020	5590020	Voting holiday election reform.
5590020	5591020	Number two.
5591020	5592020	No.
5592020	5593020	Go back to the Twitter Wars.
5593020	5598180	So one of the problems you're solving up here is your son being embarrassed or hating
5598180	5599180	you.
5599180	5600180	What was it?
5600180	5601180	No, no.
5601180	5602180	Okay.
5602180	5603180	You ready?
5603180	5604180	Well, I know.
5604180	5605180	I also want.
5605180	5606180	We're fixing that tonight.
5606180	5607180	I want socialist Democrats.
5607180	5608180	This entire life.
5608180	5609180	Sure.
5609180	5610180	You know what?
5610180	5611460	It's like I said I had to get a normal job.
5611460	5612900	I work a union job.
5612900	5614780	I work check to check just like everybody.
5614780	5615780	Number two.
5615780	5616780	Number two.
5616780	5617780	You know what?
5617780	5618780	I gave you the pen.
5618780	5619780	Right?
5619780	5620780	Oh my God.
5620780	5621780	All right.
5621780	5622780	Hey.
5622780	5627220	If they gave awards for comptroller's, you would get it.
5627220	5630220	So I need.
5630220	5633740	All right.
5633740	5636220	So what are the Twitter Wars?
5636220	5637220	Okay.
5637220	5638220	Spencer.
5638220	5642140	They're supposed to energize these celebrities by sharing.
5642140	5643140	Here it is.
5643140	5644140	Shame and hope.
5644140	5645140	Yes.
5645140	5646140	Here it is.
5646140	5647140	And.
5647140	5655780	Do great tastes that go great together through shame and hope.
5655780	5656780	Absolutely.
5656780	5657780	I love.
5657780	5659340	You got hope in my shame.
5659340	5662460	You got shame in my hope.
5662460	5672100	You're getting to you're getting I need him for my music.
5672100	5673100	No, no.
5673100	5674420	You're you're wielding an implement.
5674420	5678460	It's like, oh, no, you can't go ever and go back to number one.
5678460	5679860	So all right.
5679860	5681340	We really got to get through.
5681340	5682340	All right.
5682340	5683340	Yeah.
5683340	5684340	We don't have to get through the list.
5684340	5688380	The most important thing is the first thing everybody called the truck was elected.
5688380	5689380	Well, called the personality.
5689380	5690380	I need your help with.
5690380	5691380	Maybe we can talk.
5691460	5693140	Trump's more popular than Dan.
5693820	5694820	No, no, it's fine.
5695100	5698660	What the problem is, is these stars need either put up or shut the fuck up.
5699180	5700460	I'm going to go with these people.
5700460	5702220	Bill Maher is our next shot.
5702220	5703220	Number five.
5703340	5704340	No, no.
5708420	5713460	No, no, no, no, we just need number one.
5713700	5714460	Just number one.
5714460	5717460	OK, so the key is everybody remember you're going to hear it all the time.
5717900	5721500	Only 26 percent of the people elected Trump.
5721620	5722740	Twenty six percent.
5722940	5727620	Forty seven percent of the motherfuckers all stayed home and just don't care.
5727620	5728740	But then they bitch every day.
5729100	5732260	I'm afraid to ask for, you know, an audience participation of who didn't vote.
5732500	5734420	I'll be the audience participation.
5734460	5735900	All right. Here we go.
5736740	5737740	Here we go. Here we go.
5738420	5741660	What we're going to do first thing, I'm going to get all these stars to run on this.
5742140	5743820	All right. We've got to get through this.
5743820	5744820	No, we don't have to get through them.
5744820	5746060	No, we need to know.
5746540	5748260	I need us to get through this.
5748260	5749140	No, we can't.
5749140	5754180	They will know they don't know we're making it happen until you stop making it happen.
5754180	5755380	We got to keep it going.
5755380	5756860	I fucking love you.
5756860	5758020	Just keep it going.
5758020	5758740	I love you.
5758740	5761660	You just need you to say more words on the subject.
5762860	5763420	All right. Here we go.
5763420	5764420	Number one.
5766540	5767260	Oh, you want.
5767260	5768620	OK, I feel like I.
5769820	5770500	All right.
5770500	5771740	We can't jump around.
5771740	5772500	All right. All right.
5772500	5773260	America works.
5773260	5774780	It's going to solve all the problems.
5774780	5776780	We're going to get free college and we're going to fix things.
5776780	5777540	But we can't go there.
5777540	5782220	OK, at this point, I think we have some ideas, your platforms, your third party.
5782220	5782780	You're coming.
5782780	5785980	You're going to fix everything through the culture and then everyone will love it.
5785980	5786980	Love it. Right.
5786980	5791260	So there's this, you know, the South Park sketch, these underpants gnomes.
5791660	5793820	They're like step one, collect underpants.
5793820	5796500	Step two, step three, profit.
5796780	5798340	That's the problem I'm having here.
5798340	5803980	The step two involves create a third party, infiltrate the two party system.
5803980	5808780	Yeah, which which, by the way, the two parties control the electoral system
5808780	5810780	and the the voting system.
5810780	5813740	So if you wanted to make voter change, you'd actually have to think about it.
5813740	5818020	You'd have to join the parties because those are the people who vote on the voting laws.
5818020	5822500	So you literally could not affect voting reform if you were a third party.
5822500	5826260	You'd have to join the Republicans and the Democrats and get both of those parties
5826260	5827340	to change their voting.
5827340	5831580	And you'd need to do that before you can have the viable third party in the first place.
5831580	5837700	So I feel like even all your policies are what I'd consider standard social policies
5837700	5839300	that are very helpful and very good.
5839300	5839980	But they're good. Yeah.
5839980	5841500	But they're not going. I agree.
5841500	5842260	But you can't.
5842260	5845660	But without this first step, you can't enact any of that.
5845660	5850140	And that's that's like asking like that's like saying, OK, I got this plan,
5850380	5851940	delivery stuff.
5851940	5855180	All I have to do is fly and then I could deliver all these packages.
5855180	5856100	It'll be easy.
5856100	5859900	But that's really hard in that in our Twitter interaction.
5859900	5863700	And today there has been not it's been completely glossed over in a way
5863700	5867860	that I think we have to, you know, come to terms with before we can really go forward,
5867860	5871180	because I think we can all agree that it's important to make the world better.
5873700	5877500	OK, I got my hand up and you're 100 percent right.
5877540	5883260	Yes. No, I am. Except except it can be done through the Senate
5883260	5888660	if I can get four to six seats and if some of those seats are famous people.
5888860	5891260	Forty six Congress. No, four to six. Right.
5891260	5892980	Four to six. Four to six.
5892980	5895060	So let's say six hundred and twenty six seats.
5896340	5897860	You're on the ball.
5897860	5899780	That was better than you guys react to.
5902420	5903460	Good job, Jeff.
5903460	5908460	OK, this is what I'm counting on is if I can get some people involved
5908460	5910860	that can make some noise that will be listened to.
5911060	5915300	Sadly, just because they're stars, we will be able to disrupt the Senate
5915300	5916460	because the Senate's the key.
5916460	5919140	What Bernie did wrong, and I love Bernie and I hate Bernie.
5919340	5920980	He took my plan and ruined it.
5920980	5922780	You can't do it. You're right.
5922780	5925660	You're right about you can't do it on a presidential basis.
5925780	5928380	But the Senate is a place because of the way the Senate works.
5928700	5932580	Four to six seats could stop everything till we get that.
5932580	5935100	So how many votes does it take to get one seat?
5935100	5938020	Like how many people would it take to vote a Senate seat?
5938180	5939540	Now, this is the great part.
5939540	5941060	It has to happen on 20.
5941060	5942700	I think you got this whole room.
5942700	5945660	First of all, these people were all I don't think so.
5945660	5947300	They just want me to shut the fuck up.
5947300	5949540	Oh, you got that. You got that from him.
5949540	5950660	Yeah, I think.
5950660	5954140	But it's not going to happen till he says so because thank you, Dan.
5954340	5957700	Thank you. Well, I'm not I'm not going to say it's not evening at the Apollo.
5957700	5959580	I'm not going to have like somebody sweep you off the stage.
5959580	5961900	I and I'm not going to go through this whole thing.
5962100	5963020	This has been a long show.
5963020	5965940	And if crazy people weren't allowed on this stage, where would we stop?
5965940	5967340	Right. Right.
5967340	5968700	Like, where would we stop enforcing that?
5968700	5973660	Right. I think I like people think it like I think I'd be thinking about this.
5973660	5974780	Well, Dan, exactly.
5974780	5976700	I'd rather have these conversations and not have it.
5976700	5978700	So so anyways, why am I getting it?
5978700	5980140	Why am I justifying myself to you?
5980140	5981700	Keep telling us your political plan.
5981700	5983620	OK, well, let's concentrate on the important part.
5983620	5987220	Yes, it's very important because this is what we've been fighting about him and I.
5988260	5991980	You're one of the people, Dan, that I can't say to you because I love you too much.
5991980	5995260	But you're we're at the point you hate what's going on as much as me,
5995460	5998100	where it's time for people in your position to put up or shut up
5998500	6001780	to either get the fuck out of it or get into it.
6002140	6006780	And I'm going to be telling people on my list is work part time for a couple of years.
6006780	6008020	You can still tour.
6008020	6010820	You can still do shit and you can still be a senator.
6011180	6013980	You can do it and they will listen to them.
6013980	6015740	You want me to be a senator?
6015740	6017380	No, no, no, no, she wants.
6017380	6020300	OK, no, he wants Natalie Portman to be a.
6020300	6022260	No, no, no, Dan.
6022260	6024580	He wants Natalie Portman to be a senator or something.
6024580	6026820	So he's using me to get to Natalie Portman.
6026820	6030540	Yeah, I don't think you can get me to Nancy.
6030540	6031540	Did you see the bubble?
6031540	6034780	No, you're using me to get to Wil Wheaton and Wil Wheaton.
6034780	6035500	Oh, wait, here we go.
6035500	6036620	Hold on. Ready?
6036620	6037740	I for one.
6037740	6039780	This is how, hey, Dan, I don't know.
6039780	6040820	I'm going to wait.
6040820	6044020	I'm using you for Ackermann, Proops,
6044540	6046260	Paul F. Tom, you're going to use it.
6046260	6048300	You're going to build from me to Ackermann.
6050820	6052820	Get the fuck out of here.
6054620	6056540	You just said you're not going to get me.
6056820	6059460	I'm not going to drawn into this.
6059540	6061260	But that all goes to Ackermann.
6061260	6064540	Now, Senator Ackermann, you have the floor now.
6065700	6066580	No, sorry.
6066580	6068180	Ackermann is on tour right now.
6068180	6069540	He committed 20 percent.
6069540	6072340	Which Senator Natalie Portman, please keep it down for a moment.
6072380	6073220	Thank you.
6073220	6076820	Now, Dan, I just I have dreams you could get me to Clooney,
6076820	6079140	but I just didn't want to jump too far.
6079140	6083060	OK, but OK, so but I've been in this situation before where people.
6083100	6086260	Yeah, well, so I mean, you know, you know that I know that.
6086300	6087500	And I'm not saying through
6087500	6089340	I'm not saying throw a holiday party invite me
6089340	6090380	so I don't bore a nose.
6090380	6093100	You should explain that because maybe, well, of course, it's insulting.
6093100	6096020	Like, it's a very, you know, like, like, look, I'd be the well,
6096020	6099220	it would be very hypocritical of me to decry narcissism.
6099860	6101820	But you could that's the way the world works.
6101820	6102740	You have this agenda.
6102740	6107020	You don't care about, you know, like, like, like, like you like.
6107700	6109060	I have this pulpit.
6109060	6111140	You have an opportunity to connect with these people.
6111140	6113500	I've given you their time.
6114180	6118700	And you're you're like, all we've heard so far is is that you're hoping
6118700	6122100	to get as many famous people as possible to build up to some thing.
6122140	6123820	Yeah, I just played this aboard them.
6123820	6126900	But you're also like, it seems a little bit like you've learned.
6127180	6129500	You've learned what to do by watching Trump.
6130220	6132220	Oh, God, I had this and this drives me crazy.
6132220	6134140	I've been telling my friends and they all know because they've listened
6134140	6136980	to this for so many years and I was so worried.
6136980	6139420	I said, you know what everybody's going to say, baby, is they're all going to say
6139620	6141100	I'm reacting to Trump. Right.
6141100	6142740	No, I had I decided to run.
6142740	6144740	No, I think it's good to react to Trump.
6144740	6146500	But I don't think you just overreact to Trump.
6146500	6149100	I just don't think you should emulate him necessarily.
6149140	6152460	And it's I wish it wasn't the case, but our society is a cult of personality
6152460	6155540	and you know it as well as anybody, but maybe that's the problem.
6155540	6157980	Maybe it's a problem, but it's going to get used one more time.
6157980	6159020	OK, here's my analogy.
6159020	6162500	I tell my friends the cult of personality is a loaded gun in the middle of the table.
6162820	6164300	Sure. The Democrats are on one side.
6164300	6166180	The Republicans are on the other side.
6166180	6168300	They are going to use that loaded gun in 2018.
6168300	6172380	Remind me why it has to be 2018 because we got to flip the Senate.
6173300	6175460	What? We've got to flip the Senate.
6175860	6178100	OK, wait, OK, hold on. Yep.
6178380	6182340	Here's now I think what you happen is this is a big conversation
6182340	6186460	because we are in this post fact world and it's like Democrats have to decide,
6186460	6188900	are we going to be post truth or are we going to be truth truth?
6189220	6191380	And so I think what you're talking about is valuable.
6191500	6195860	But I would say that my trepidation is that Republicans in the GOP
6196220	6199100	are bathed in lies and they're bathed in dishonesty.
6199100	6200860	And that's that's their wheelhouse.
6200860	6205060	So the idea that we're going to be able to fight on that level strikes me as kind of
6205260	6208100	I don't know. It's just because we're we're noobs and they're like,
6208100	6209860	you know, they're the mob kind of.
6209860	6212340	You just seems like a heart. It's unfair.
6212460	6214060	We have the truth on our side.
6214060	6215820	So like we could bring that to bear.
6215820	6218220	But like, I don't know that playing their tricks is like.
6218380	6222420	And that's a question I've had with myself because it might be that that's the answer.
6222420	6225140	But I feel like we've lost some score.
6225140	6227580	We fought them if we look at the tactics.
6227580	6229860	Yeah, like they did that made them win.
6229860	6233980	Right. They got on Twitter and they they they tweeted racist memes that weren't.
6234220	6235620	That's like like like like.
6235620	6239420	And in my personal opinion, that's the problem with the bipartisan system
6239420	6242180	is that the Democrats have already become that they always every four years.
6242180	6245220	They always go, oh, you know what the Republicans did anyways.
6245220	6248100	But but like like you're wearing a kilt.
6248220	6250500	I say we just I said we wrap.
6250500	6253380	I said you guys. That's what the strategic we wrap it out.
6253380	6255100	I think we have to wrap this. Oh, damn it.
6255100	6257380	You got a fucking rat. Well, it's well, yeah.
6257380	6258500	Let's look what.
6258500	6261380	So you drove from Washington or you flew from Washington.
6261380	6263740	Yeah. OK. So what was the board?
6263740	6267380	The plane ticket cost. Maybe we know. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6267500	6269700	I mean, it was too much for me, but no, no.
6270940	6273980	What I what what I need from this is I've gotten I've got an exposure
6274100	6276140	if people would just go to the human party on Facebook.
6276140	6278700	There's more about it. The human party on Facebook.
6278780	6281580	Yeah. OK. So it's it's it's a real thing.
6281580	6282420	And I guess. Aren't you?
6282420	6286420	Aren't you worried, though, about Natalie Portman's very notable stance
6286420	6289460	on the state of Israel? She loves it.
6289700	6292340	You know, like she's Israeli.
6292540	6295340	I think her hawkish foreign policy.
6296340	6299700	Well, yeah, but she's a stepping stone to Amy Adams.
6301540	6304980	Yeah. Fuck, fuck humanity.
6304980	6306820	It's all just a fucking carnival.
6306820	6307980	I wish it was Madman.
6307980	6310420	The thing, the thing, the thing that has me most, Dan,
6310420	6313220	is that I've known you for many years and I didn't know you could get me to
6313220	6316060	Ockerman. Oh, I know.
6316060	6318940	You I mean, not in one step, not in one step.
6319100	6320260	I'm sure not in one step.
6320860	6323620	Yeah, he'll probably go through one of the engineers or something.
6323660	6326060	He's got to go to the Sklar brothers.
6329660	6332660	OK, the reason all this is this way is because these people,
6332660	6335620	your audience, they love to support crowdfunding.
6335900	6338260	The only way I can do this is through crowdfunding.
6338260	6341020	Right. I've seen dreams happen on your show through crowdfunding.
6341340	6344100	And I will never wait with money.
6344100	6346420	I can only do this if my crowd fund hits.
6346540	6348460	Otherwise, I have to go back to my normal job.
6348460	6350620	What do you call it? What are we going to?
6350620	6353300	What's the site? It's not ready yet, because they say to be ready first.
6353300	6354420	OK, now here's your problem.
6354420	6356940	No, they say to be ready first and they're going to go to the human party.
6357460	6359460	And then I'm going to have the date set. Right.
6359460	6362380	And then and that's so that driving to the human party, setting the date.
6362580	6365820	They say you need to have your money lined up before you start your crowd fund.
6365980	6368060	So you're not supposed to start too early. OK.
6369060	6371500	Damn it. I'm on your side.
6371620	6373740	All right. We're all on your side.
6373740	6377980	So so I'm actually not on your side.
6378220	6383540	I'm like the devil that showed up to destroy your dreams.
6388060	6391020	And I am. I'm going to keep talking because that's horrible.
6391020	6395980	But I do think that you don't like something that's called the cult of personality.
6396460	6398100	It's a fact of life. Right.
6398100	6401020	You don't like it, but you're using it like it's the loaded gun.
6401020	6403580	And they're going to use it if we don't. But that they use it.
6403580	6406540	Well, we're looking for worse into 2018.
6406580	6410180	They're going to look looking for as a human kind is an answer to problems,
6410180	6412980	not using the problems that five list.
6412980	6414980	That's the that's the answer is that five lists.
6414980	6417580	Yeah, but this Twitter were yours.
6417580	6419020	You're I love it.
6419020	6422220	Yeah. Believe me, I also I call telephone terrorism.
6422220	6425460	I read every item on this.
6425620	6428580	I feel like you're using poison.
6428700	6430940	I am for health. I am.
6431100	6432580	And I don't. OK.
6432580	6434940	OK, I'm going to I'll riff.
6434940	6437780	I'll riff a pitch like putting my money where my mouth is.
6438020	6442500	What if we were able to use the holy fuck, the current bipartisan system?
6442500	6447380	We were able to start locally creaking, you know, like, like, like, like, do like
6449300	6451740	community stuff, call ourselves Democrats.
6451980	6456180	But like, like hell tea party, though, have a little asterisk on it.
6456180	6458940	You know, like, like, like, like, we're we're we're blue shield.
6458940	6460180	Democrats are leftists.
6460180	6461860	We're we're long cabin Democrats.
6461860	6465220	You know, we're we're we're people that actually care about like, like,
6465220	6466500	we, you know, blah, blah, blah.
6466500	6470260	And we we we give interest free loans to people.
6470740	6473220	We should call it like something that everyone can access,
6473220	6475820	like the human party.
6475820	6478580	All right. Well, anyways, I'm not going to I'll pitch that next episode.
6478580	6480020	But but I it's good.
6480020	6481060	I thought he was just going to go.
6481060	6483060	It was going to be a guy in a kilt that gave us drugs.
6483060	6484180	I didn't know I was going to fucking go.
6484180	6487260	Well, OK. Yeah, it was going to give us the keys to Ockerman.
6487580	6489940	No, Ockerman. What about proof?
6490260	6490860	I don't even know.
6490860	6493700	It doesn't even look like I'm directly like I get you to Ockerman.
6493700	6494820	Oh, contact. OK.
6494820	6497340	As goes Ockerman, so does the country.
6497460	6498300	No. OK, see.
6498300	6500780	And I'm starting small because I have very little confidence in myself.
6500780	6502580	I don't think I can get Clooney yet.
6502580	6503660	Right. No, I know.
6503660	6506060	I'm very, very insulted by all of this.
6506060	6508060	Yes. Oh, I know.
6508060	6509340	I've got I get it.
6509340	6510500	Who should I have mentioned?
6510500	6511940	Because that's my problem.
6511940	6513140	I should. No, you should.
6513140	6515820	No, Dan, Dan has to be behind the scenes.
6515820	6517260	Dan has to be the man.
6517260	6519900	He's the heart. Dan, you don't want to run, right?
6520180	6522060	No, I don't. No, that's right.
6522060	6523820	Right now, I want to run. Yeah.
6526860	6529500	I want to hide. I want to I want to duck.
6529500	6530860	I want to cover.
6531260	6532340	Oh, my God.
6532980	6536260	But it's 10 o'clock, but I know I do.
6536260	6539260	Like, I don't want you to be mocked and ridiculed.
6539260	6540900	And I don't want you to be deflated.
6540900	6544540	I think that I think that I think that I'm fucking crazy right now.
6544540	6547060	Like, like, I feel like there's Nazis taking over the.
6547060	6549140	Yeah. So let's do something about it.
6549140	6550380	I'm alarmed about it.
6550380	6554740	I don't I don't I don't I don't I the stuff that I'm seeing written
6554740	6557420	on your giant pads, I everything I've seen.
6557420	6558580	I don't see. This is the key.
6558580	6560300	I don't see anything that I disagree with.
6560300	6564100	I definitely need to election reform.
6564100	6566100	We definitely need to change it all.
6566100	6568860	But but I also agree with Spencer that like we have to think
6568860	6572460	even four to six Senate seats is a huge accomplishment.
6572460	6573700	And it will stop everything.
6573700	6576620	If their people would listen, if they are listened to,
6576740	6580900	if there are people that are listened to stars, sadly, it will happen.
6580900	6585060	People will watch C-SPAN to see what happens when we when we're on the floor.
6585580	6587620	They will stop to watch if they see that.
6587620	6589500	Oh, my God, you got a guy from Westworld.
6589500	6591620	You could ask him, right?
6591620	6592820	Do you want to run?
6592820	6594620	No, thank you.
6594620	6598340	Within three years, if you start with a friendship with him, Anthony Hopkins.
6599140	6603540	Oh, well, you could quickly be in a war with Anthony Hopkins.
6603540	6605780	Imagine that.
6606420	6608060	Let's hear it for John Roswell, everybody.

6779700	6781460	Oh, yeah. I see.
6781460	6784740	I've seen a little on Instagram today that are maybe Facebook
6784740	6788500	that Jane may have posted of one of your little Harmon town comics.
6788500	6790860	It's very, very cute and very sweet about it.
6790860	6791820	Jane's a sweetie.
6791820	6795540	Jane's Jane's the official like, like she's like
6795780	6798700	like coordinating all of the fandom on Facebook.
6798700	6802860	And there was there was a guy that was like, like, you know,
6803780	6806820	having suicidal ideology and then like he was off the grid.
6806820	6809940	And then like, like Jane, like I'm hearing this all third hand
6809940	6812540	because I can't get I can't get involved.
6813780	6816260	I'm too busy running for Senate lately.
6818620	6820660	But but but yeah, Jane just props to Jane.
6820660	6824020	I mean, Jane's like Jane's like out there, like coordinating.
6824020	6825500	And I don't know.
6825500	6829780	Just like there's a little family that's like ancillary related to Harmon town
6829780	6833140	that doesn't even have to have to do with whether I'm a good or a bad person.
6833420	6838580	You know, it's like, it's like, oh, we all like Cheetos and we're good people.
6838580	6842220	Like Cheetos doesn't have to be good for you.
6843700	6844660	I like that.
6844660	6846020	You know, it doesn't have to be.
6846020	6849220	I don't I don't I don't have to if I if I if I joined that Facebook group,
6849220	6851780	for instance, within two weeks, it would be like be decimated
6852660	6854780	because I'd be like, man, jerk off.
6854780	6857940	And I said, yeah, I'm mad at students still mad about season four.
6859700	6861180	And everybody be like, I don't like this.
6861180	6862100	It feels toxic.
6862460	6866660	Yeah, I like that there could be a little that the Maypole doesn't have to be me.
6867980	6870980	Yeah, I mean, I when I respond to that.
6871540	6874860	No, I just I made that comic like a year ago,
6874860	6876460	and I didn't really know about that.
6876460	6880420	And Jane like immediately like reached out to me and she was like super sweet.
6880420	6882860	And she wrote me this very nice message I still like think about.
6882860	6885900	She's very and she got me like into that.
6885900	6887060	Like I didn't I didn't know.
6887060	6889980	I didn't know. Because when I when I was like when Harmon town was like my lifeline
6889980	6893540	like years ago, like I it really felt like there were only like a few of us listening.
6893540	6895780	I didn't realize there were so many people who listened to the show.
6895780	6897460	Weren't you kind of down when we met you?
6897460	6899580	I mean, this is like, yeah, I was like super.
6899580	6903300	I was like, we asked the sentiment out there going through any pain.
6903300	6905540	And you you laid some heavy stuff on us.
6905700	6907700	Yeah, you didn't disappoint. You were right.
6908540	6911460	I mean, I yeah, I was super depressed.
6911860	6914260	And I I mean, which was neat.
6914260	6916900	We loved it. But that's a very like my memory.
6916900	6919260	It's like a paramedic thing for emotion.
6919260	6922380	It's like, oh, look how horrible she's an emotional.
6923380	6925540	I have like this share picture.
6925540	6929060	Yeah, but I'm just saying like that's it's it's wonderful to see you.
6929300	6932380	I don't but I don't I also don't want to worship at the altar of like
6932620	6933940	too many people in our audience.
6933940	6935980	Like that's that's the story we hear over and over again.
6935980	6938540	It's like that that thing of like.
6938540	6943780	Smiling and being happy and clean and bright and shiny doesn't make you a good person.
6943780	6945620	It doesn't mean that your life is on the right track.
6945620	6947140	But it's also at the same time.
6947140	6950860	It's nice to see somebody like that was down in the roller coaster.
6950860	6952460	Be be up on it. I don't know.
6952460	6955060	I'm drunk in the shows over again.
