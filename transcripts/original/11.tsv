0	20000	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
20000	26400	Harmon Town is now officially in session.
26400	30400	Thank you for coming down to Hollywood, California in the Nerdmelt Theater.
30400	33400	And those of you listening out in Podcast Universe, thank you.
33400	43400	Please join us all in welcoming the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon.
43400	46400	All right, welcome.
46400	51400	Welcome to my magical forest of microphones.
51400	56400	I have tied a red ribbon around the one that has a pot of gold under it.
56400	60400	Do you ever hear that leprechaun story, Jeff?
60400	63400	Jeff, have you ever heard that old leprechaun story?
63400	66400	There's not a single leprechaun story I haven't heard, Dan.
66400	70400	The guy catches a leprechaun and he says,
70400	74400	give me your pot of gold, which is your right if you catch a leprechaun.
74400	77400	But the leprechaun can still fuck with you a little bit.
77400	80400	He has like options left.
80400	87400	And so this leprechaun says to the guy, okay, I'll give you my pot of gold.
87400	89400	Come to the forest tomorrow.
89400	92400	It's under the tree with the red ribbon around it.
92400	96400	And so, of course, maybe some of you see where this is going.
96400	99400	But this is a golden age for leprechauns.
99400	101400	People weren't that savvy yet.
101400	104400	They hadn't watched enough CW shows.
104400	107400	Grim hadn't aired yet.
107400	110400	People were mythically deaf and blind.
110400	113400	So he let the fucking leprechaun go based on that promise alone,
113400	117400	shows up a whole forest of trees with red ribbons around them.
117400	120400	But this is not a pot of gold you're going to get tonight.
120400	125400	What you're going to get tonight is a podcast of gold.
125400	128400	No, it wasn't.
128400	130400	A potcast of gold?
130400	134400	Pot now. It doesn't matter.
134400	136400	Nothing matters.
136400	138400	I'm in a good mood. I'm very excited.
138400	140400	Sometimes I'm nervous when I come up.
140400	145400	I feel, as I've said before, biorhythmically, I feel like, well, I'm not witty tonight.
145400	147400	I have nothing to say. I'm tongue-tied.
147400	155400	My frontal lobe is a little fatigued, perhaps, from some intricate sex game I played.
155400	160400	But then sometimes I come up and I go, oh, man, I'm really going to slay people.
160400	161400	I can't wait to get up.
161400	164400	This is one of those nights that doesn't matter because we have Greg Proops coming up here.
164400	167400	Greg Proops is here tonight.
167400	170400	So who cares? It's really on him.
170400	172400	Yeah, it's on him.
172400	173400	It's just a Greg Proops show.
173400	176400	If this show sucks, it's simply on his shoulders.
176400	182400	Yeah, I'll sabotage it so I can walk away from this going, I don't see what the big deal of Greg Proops is.
182400	187400	I had him on my show. It didn't turn into diamonds.
187400	196400	But more so than that, he's a good friend of Jeff's and, therefore, by proxy, a much-adored friend of mine.
196400	201400	We went and saw his podcast in San Francisco in January, last January at Sketchfest.
201400	204400	I was blown away. I think that's when I got the nuts up.
204400	208400	Were we already doing this and recording it and podcasting it?
208400	211400	No, we weren't. Just after.
211400	215400	So he's actually kind of a bit of an unwitting Obi-Wan to this show, I think,
215400	219400	because I sat there in a comedy club and watched Proops just babble into a microphone,
219400	226400	and of course I thought, well, then I'll do it and put it on iTunes and make people listen to it.
226400	236400	But he's going to specifically come up primarily to play Dungeons & Dragons with us.
236400	240400	We have Spencer, our dungeon master, sitting anxiously on deck.
240400	245400	Yeah, Spencer is like a Brahmin bull. Is that a kind of bull?
245400	249400	A Brahmin bull is more of a Hindu kind of thing.
249400	252400	A Brahmin bull is no big deal. They're very relaxed.
252400	255400	Yeah, they're in no danger at all.
255400	261400	A health update.
261400	266400	Last week, I explained that I had been having these light-headed spells,
266400	269400	and I've been hot on the trail on how to figure out what's wrong with them.
269400	274400	Vitamin D deficiency epiphanies, magnesium epiphanies, potassium epiphanies,
274400	279400	and then I told the story of how Aaron gave me the anxiety epiphany at the San Diego Zoo.
279400	282400	Oh, it's just anxiety. As soon as I knew that, everything was fine.
282400	287400	But then that very night of the podcast, I was like, still, I'm having these light-headed spells.
287400	291400	I've got to go back into the doctor. Even though I've got all this blood work, what's wrong with me?
291400	295400	What is it? There's nothing wrong with my lab results. I go back into the doctor.
295400	299400	I tell him about these light-headed spells, and he diagnosed me.
299400	307400	The bad news is I have respiratory alkalosis, and the good news is that's like the hiccups.
307400	311400	And his prescription was literally to breathe less.
311400	318400	Respiratory alkalosis is when you accidentally hyperventilate, and that's it.
318400	325400	And it's a syndrome in the short term where if you're undergoing stress, good or bad,
325400	328400	you kind of accidentally breathe just a hair too deeply.
328400	332400	Then you get a little light-headed, and then you go, I'm getting light-headed.
332400	337400	And then so you go, you flood your body with oxygen because you want to clear your head.
337400	340400	And then it gets worse and worse, and then the more worse it gets.
340400	345400	And the one thing I hadn't tried, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea in those moments,
345400	351400	is breathing less. And that's all I have to do, and I've tried it like seven times.
351400	355400	I've had little things come out, and then I go, I exhale if I have the hiccups,
355400	359400	and then I just take shallow breaths. I felt like the biggest dick.
359400	362400	Well, when you say breathing less, you mean inhale less?
362400	366400	Yeah, don't take a big breath and hold it. Just exhale and hold it,
366400	370400	which makes you feel like you're going to die, but then at the same time, it clears my head up.
370400	374400	Doesn't that give you a stroke at some point, if you deoxygenate your brain?
374400	376400	Well, no, not when...
376400	378400	Dan, breathe. Breathe, for fuck's sake.
378400	383400	Not when you have too much oxygen in your blood, which is why you're feeling light-headed.
383400	388400	It's fucking weird. Your body runs on this balance of gases, CO2 and O2,
388400	394400	and if you have less CO2, even though CO2 is bad, it's not like we use it for anything.
394400	399400	But if the balance is... I'm sure we use it for a lot. Don't write me any letters.
399400	401400	It's CO2 heads.
401400	403400	We use it for trees.
403400	406400	Yeah, we give back to the earth.
406400	412400	If it's slightly imbalanced, you have a regulator in your head that will eventually make you faint,
412400	414400	and what fainting is is just your body going,
414400	420400	this guy can't breathe right on his own, and just knock him out and I'll take it from here,
420400	422400	and then regulates your breathing and you wake up.
422400	426400	And I think that's why women fainted, you know, that whole fainting couch culture,
426400	428400	they were wearing corsets and tying them really tight,
428400	431400	so they were fucking with the balance of the gases in their bodies,
431400	433400	so women were regularly fainting.
433400	435400	And then the men who designed the corsets would say,
435400	438400	well, you're hysterical. This is something that women do.
438400	442400	Let's get that corset off right now.
442400	445400	Yeah, no, keep it on, but let's not let them vote.
445400	447400	Okay, so...
447400	451400	But I don't need to get political tonight, because we have Greg Proops here.
451400	453400	It's on him now.
453400	455400	Were you bringing him up?
455400	459400	No, no, no. I will now. I wanted to update you on my respiratory alkalosis.
459400	461400	It's a new thing I'm going to blame for everything.
461400	463400	Respiratory alkalosis.
463400	465400	So to recap, bring up the...
465400	467400	I like that it has alcohol in it.
467400	469400	I know, believe me.
469400	474400	It's respiratory alkalosis, and I went, oh, fuck, here it is.
474400	476400	The glory days are gone.
476400	479400	You have acute vodcosus.
479400	482400	Yeah, I was so excited that it was an alkaloid thing.
482400	484400	I was like, yes!
484400	487400	Oh, ten more years.
487400	489400	Ten more years.
489400	494400	One of drinking and eight of not knowing what eight plus one is.
498400	501400	That was a quotable.
501400	504400	You just watched my brain die a little bit.
504400	509400	I'm no scientist or a doctor, and I'm not bad at math and putting things together,
509400	512400	but why don't you just wear a corset?
512400	513400	That's a good idea.
513400	514400	Stick a corset on.
514400	517400	Well, I don't know if the corset makes more CO2 or less CO2.
517400	518400	I don't know why women are famous.
518400	521400	It makes it harder for you to inhale oxygen, so you're probably...
521400	522400	Too much CO2, right?
522400	523400	Yeah.
523400	525400	So, okay, I'm going to start wearing a corset.
525400	528400	I mean, not that you haven't lost a lot of weight, but still...
528400	529400	No, it can only help.
529400	530400	Two birds with one stone.
530400	534400	I'll wear, like, a really tight Shatner girdle.
534400	536400	Yeah, you look like Robert Mission.
536400	541400	And I'll just have a hair checker for challenging people to fights.
541400	542400	What are you talking about?
542400	543400	Get up here.
543400	544400	I won't accept it.
544400	546400	I'll just punch you out.
546400	547400	You, sir, have...
547400	551400	I'll have Gina sweat, and then I'll just make out with the nearest most racially diverse
551400	555400	woman in the audience to simulate her being green.
555400	558400	Wait, you're only going to fight when you're on stage?
558400	559400	Yeah, I don't know, man.
559400	561400	I lost track of what I was saying.
561400	562400	Let's try to...
562400	564400	I don't want to get on a lot of tangents tonight.
564400	567400	Is it because you hung out with Greg Proups right before the show?
567400	570400	Um...
570400	575400	Yeah, no, I think that's it.
575400	577400	I updated you on my health situation.
577400	578400	Right.
578400	579400	And I think...
579400	581400	I haven't seen you a lot.
581400	582400	You were gone last week.
582400	583400	Yeah, you were gone last week.
583400	585400	You were gone, then I was gone, and then you were gone again.
585400	586400	I haven't seen you at all.
586400	587400	It's exciting.
587400	588400	Yeah.
588400	589400	I miss you, Dan.
589400	591400	It's cool that while you were gone last week, Aaron could fill in.
591400	599400	Yeah, well, I listened to the raw file of The Last Harmon Town when you guys played...
599400	605400	Aaron McGathey guest-controlled, and I heard The Dungeons and Dragons where we introduced
605400	606400	a new character.
606400	607400	Yeah.
607400	608400	Yeah.
608400	609400	Yeah.
609400	615400	And that character became a...
615400	616400	Was very...
616400	617400	Vocal?
617400	619400	Was there adamant?
619400	623400	Very proactive about becoming a permanent member of the adventuring party.
623400	631400	Part of it, a lot of it was kind of overtly begging to be a regular member of a campaign.
631400	635400	Jeff and Aaron have kind of a sibling rivalry.
635400	639400	He calls her the girl in the treehouse, or the little sister in the treehouse.
639400	641400	She's like a little sister in a treehouse.
641400	642400	Yeah.
642400	649400	Our next guest was described by Herman Melville as...
650400	655400	The biggest asshole that ever sailed there.
655400	657400	He's an awesome, really...
657400	660400	He's truly the smartest man in the world, and he hosts a podcast called The Smartest Man
660400	661400	in the World.
661400	662400	He blew my mind at San Francisco.
662400	667400	He's one of Jeff's very good friends from the Who's Line world, and he's amazing, and
667400	670400	we're thrilled to have him here as a surprised friend.
670400	672400	Let's bring Greg Proops up.
672400	673400	Greg Proops, everybody.
673400	683400	Yeah, you can go there, if you like.
687400	689400	The vodka's there.
689400	690400	Yeah.
690400	691400	Greg Proops, yeah.
691400	696400	You know, I've been sitting backstage listening to this, what is it, carbon dioxide you're
696400	697400	talking about or whatever?
697400	700400	What a load of shit, ladies and gentlemen.
700400	701400	There's no global warming.
701400	703400	I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.
703400	707400	If you just breathe normally, penguins never die.
707400	711400	See, I never read the paper or anything.
711400	713400	It's good to have somebody up here who's informed.
713400	714400	Yeah.
714400	717400	Who was it, oxygen and carbon dioxide, was it?
717400	718400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
718400	721400	There's a delicate balance between them in your bloodstream.
721400	725400	I feel weird standing in front and then staring back over my shoulder.
725400	726400	I like the Greg Proops.
726400	728400	Kelly McGillis on the Top Gun poster.
728400	732400	Queen to Rook 4.
732400	735400	The most dangerous game of all.
735400	738400	You're not hunting a human, but human chess.
738400	741400	The most dangerous game is when you're just loose on an island.
741400	745400	The human chess is actually relatively safe.
745400	748400	You could end up being one of the many pieces that lives to the end.
748400	751400	Sorry.
751400	755400	So, Greg Kitten.
755400	757400	Yeah, Dan Kitten.
757400	759400	Greg, would you rather sit?
759400	761400	Well, no, I don't want Dan to be uncomfortable.
761400	763400	He said he didn't want to look behind him.
763400	765400	Oh, sit here?
765400	766400	Thank you.
766400	769400	Is that what comp trolling is, moving chairs?
769400	771400	I've always wondered.
771400	774400	Shouldn't it be chomp trolling then?
774400	776400	Thank you for that mild laughter.
776400	777400	That's what...
777400	781400	That jape actually warranted that small of a response.
781400	786400	You were exactly right in your measured and fucking well thought out response.
786400	792400	Greg, might I say that I appreciate you spending the last ten minutes in the green room alone with vodka,
792400	796400	and then you came on stage and went headlong straight for the vodka again.
796400	801400	My glass was almost empty when I got out here, and my entire life flashed before my eyes.
801400	803400	Like a Guy Madden movie, perplexing.
803400	805400	The edge of the pool is no longer...
805400	807400	You just start to panic in the deep end.
807400	808400	Yeah, exactly.
808400	814400	Except the deep end consists of a deep level of lack of vodka.
815400	817400	Exactly.
817400	821400	It's like an ever diminishing vanishing point full of vodka.
821400	824400	We should have Spencer come up and start prepping his little table, right?
824400	825400	I always make that mistake.
825400	827400	We've had Spencer up here.
827400	828400	Is Spencer here?
828400	829400	Yeah.
829400	830400	Oh, okay. There he is.
830400	831400	All right.
831400	833400	Spencer, everybody.
833400	835400	Hi, Spencer.
835400	843400	Spencer, of course, for those of you just joining in, Spencer is our 611 D&D dungeon master.
844400	845400	How's your parents?
845400	847400	They don't want me to live with them.
847400	848400	I was just being a dick.
848400	850400	Oh, we don't do that in Harman Town?
850400	851400	I'm sorry.
851400	852400	Oh, I'm sorry.
852400	855400	I forgot this was a basket of cookie kind of place.
855400	856400	I didn't realize it.
856400	858400	I brought a basket of vitriol.
858400	859400	That's so inappropriate.
859400	864400	It's a safe place, but like Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street, you're welcome within our...
864400	868400	If you have vitriol, we're only going to make you feel good about having it.
868400	869400	Okay, thank you.
869400	872400	Because I felt uncomfortable just then, but now I feel better again.
872400	873400	See?
873400	874400	That's what we do.
874400	876400	Next week, you'll be farming potatoes with us.
876400	877400	Ah!
877400	880400	See you on the ice.
880400	884400	So, Greg has never played Dungeons and Dragons before, correct?
884400	890400	No, but I will say this, and I hope I'm not stepping on any pointed shoes that curl over
890400	893400	like that that are made of green fell when I say this.
893400	898400	I think dragons are a plague, and I'll go further.
898400	899400	They have to be eradicated.
899400	905400	And even if it requires going to a secret place such as a cavern or perhaps an area
905400	909400	on top of a mountain that they live in, I am willing to go through the series of questions
909400	915400	that have to be asked and obstacles that have to be surmounted and perhaps even groups of
915400	919400	gremlins that are filled with animosity toward anyone who's heading toward the dragon.
919400	923400	I know you've never played before, but it sounds like you're going to do great.
923400	929400	I just don't play it professionally, but in my mind, I've played it many times.
929400	933400	The dragon is my agent, and the mountain is Wilshire Boulevard.
933400	935400	It's pretty weird how I play it.
935400	938400	Did you ever play hot lava when you were a kid or anything like that, like just make
938400	939400	believe on the playground?
939400	940400	Yeah.
940400	941400	Hot lava was a goodie.
941400	943400	We also...
943400	944400	What I love about...
944400	948400	We actually played Ring Around the Rosie when I was little, and isn't that like a medieval...
948400	949400	Yeah, that's from the plague.
949400	950400	Right.
950400	952400	I mean, why are we playing plague games?
952400	953400	Is that even a game?
953400	954400	It's just a fruity dance.
954400	955400	Right.
955400	956400	It just ends with everyone laying down, right?
956400	957400	Well, that was the best part.
957400	958400	Everyone would lay down.
958400	959400	Oh, yeah.
959400	960400	Ladies, man, coming through.
960400	961400	Exactly.
961400	962400	That's four.
962400	965400	Greg, I wonder, would you like to share my popsicle?
965400	967400	I could split it in half.
967400	972400	Greg, even though you did not play Dungeons and Dragons, you did, if I'm not mistaken,
972400	975400	wear a cape or a top hat at some point?
975400	978400	Didn't you have some kind of gothy, affected clothes?
978400	979400	Well, I don't know.
979400	980400	Gothy, douchey.
980400	984400	I went to my junior prom and I carried a cane.
984400	987400	That was 1976, ladies and gentlemen.
987400	988400	That was fine.
988400	989400	Thank you very much.
989400	991400	Same hair, parted down the middle.
991400	993400	Same hair, parted down the middle.
993400	994400	Okay.
994400	995400	Thank you.
995400	996400	That was probably...
996400	997400	And no, I didn't get any.
997400	998400	No?
998400	1001400	No, unsuccessful night at the junior prom.
1001400	1005400	We went to Portland and there's no segue.
1005400	1008400	I wore a sky blue tux, if you're interested.
1008400	1009400	Sky blue tux.
1009400	1011400	Yeah, with a waistcoat.
1011400	1013400	And you affected a cane as well.
1013400	1016400	I carried a cane that had a lion head on it.
1016400	1022400	Lion head was in order to keep pussy at bay.
1022400	1026400	Beating them off with a stick, even though you weren't beating them off with a stick.
1026400	1033400	I could have dipped that stick in ambergris and dollars and never got a girl to come near me.
1033400	1036400	Doubloons.
1037400	1040400	When did you find your sexuality?
1040400	1043400	When did you become the rampant sexual mayor?
1043400	1045400	I'm sorry, stallion, rather.
1045400	1049400	Oh, it's so ambivalent and so passive aggressive, what you just did.
1049400	1051400	We don't have enough time to discuss the mayor comment.
1051400	1052400	Backhanded Davis.
1052400	1053400	Yeah.
1053400	1055400	I don't know, probably 15, I think.
1055400	1057400	I had a girlfriend when I was 16.
1057400	1058400	Is that too late in the game?
1058400	1059400	That's young.
1059400	1060400	Is it young?
1060400	1061400	Yeah.
1061400	1062400	All right.
1062400	1063400	Thank you.
1063400	1064400	That was Dan's girlfriend, finally.
1064400	1065400	It was.
1065400	1066400	I'd like to point that out.
1066400	1067400	It's an ally.
1067400	1069400	You were starting a thought, and I rudely jumped back.
1069400	1071400	I was starting a new thought, though.
1071400	1075400	If we want, we could keep following the, do you want to talk about when you lost your virginity?
1075400	1076400	Oh, no, not at all.
1076400	1077400	No, no.
1077400	1078400	Do you want to talk about?
1078400	1083400	Unless this is the Open Anthony show, in which case it's a duragur.
1083400	1088400	We went to Portland, and Portland is a very liberal, progressive city.
1088400	1091400	There's a lot of deconstruction of a lot of boundaries going on there.
1091400	1095400	Things that you wouldn't even expect to need to be deconstructed.
1095400	1097400	We went to a bar called the Green Dragon.
1097400	1098400	Erin went to the bathroom.
1098400	1102400	Again, a place that I would avoid.
1102400	1106400	Until the dragon is slain, I shall not be going through the portals of the Green Dragon.
1106400	1107400	Sorry, Dan.
1107400	1113400	She came back and a little traumatized and said that the bathrooms, instead of being men and women,
1113400	1117400	were sitting and standing.
1117400	1121400	It's a new way to, like, break down.
1121400	1122400	The deuce, you say.
1122400	1123400	Yeah.
1123400	1131400	So if you really think about that, one bathroom was for nothing but men taking shits and women, all women.
1131400	1136400	And the other bathroom was for just men who had to do nothing but pee.
1136400	1140400	It's like the worst, if you're going to, like, rearrange the bathrooms,
1140400	1142400	that's the worst thing you could do to women ever.
1142400	1148400	It's just add shitting men to their side of the war.
1148400	1152400	And Jeff pointed out, he says, well, there's lots of unisex bathrooms.
1152400	1158400	But those are bathrooms that have a toilet and a mirror and a sink and a lock on the door.
1158400	1165400	So, yes, women have to suffer the misfortune in those situations of having to go pee or poop after a man peed or pooped.
1165400	1171400	This bathroom, the sitting bathroom, had several stalls in it.
1171400	1181400	She was in there with another woman peeing and a guy in between them grunting and making a real mess.
1181400	1186400	It's such a horrible violation of everything we know to be right.
1186400	1189400	I understand the impulse to modernize everything.
1189400	1193400	And second guess are precursors, you know.
1193400	1197400	But there are a couple of things that cavemen got right.
1198400	1203400	And one of them was the idea that women should be nowhere near men's shit.
1203400	1205400	Or men's shitting.
1205400	1207400	The next thing we'll be going in the kitchen, you know what I mean?
1207400	1209400	There's a few areas, no.
1209400	1212400	Never the twain shall meet, as they say.
1212400	1215400	Next thing you know, dragons will be outside of dungeons.
1215400	1216400	Easy, Craig.
1216400	1218400	Not on my watch.
1218400	1222400	Not as long as my scimitar Nembutal has a mind to say about it.
1222400	1224400	Down Nembutal.
1224400	1226400	Craig, if you're going to blow.
1226400	1227400	Blow cool.
1227400	1228400	Alright.
1230400	1232400	Alright.
1232400	1235400	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
1235400	1238400	Jeff, you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place.
1238400	1240400	You hate liquid colognes, is that correct?
1240400	1242400	It's my nemesis.
1244400	1246400	You notice there's a forest of microphones up here.
1246400	1251400	That's because, as we mentioned last week, Erin McGathey was guest com patrolling.
1251400	1254400	So she had a character made for her in our D&D campaign.
1255400	1257400	And much to Jeff Chagrin, she...
1257400	1259400	I've heard it.
1259400	1262400	She made herself a part of the campaign permanently.
1262400	1265400	So Erin McGathey needs to come up and play her character.
1265400	1267400	Erin McGathey!
1275400	1281400	And then we welcome back, in his selfless role as the puppeteer of the cosmos,
1281400	1283400	Dungeon Master Spencer.
1283400	1285400	Who can forget?
1287400	1289400	How's it going, you guys?
1290400	1292400	Greg, I'm sorry about that neck kiss.
1292400	1294400	I forced you into a neck kiss.
1294400	1295400	I didn't even notice.
1295400	1297400	I was just happy to see you again.
1297400	1301400	You were the only person who applauded during one of the earlier things I said.
1301400	1304400	This crowd is mounted against me like a fucking romney rally.
1305400	1306400	They're Harmonites.
1306400	1307400	They're Harmonites.
1307400	1311400	I mean, they have a xenophobic anti...
1311400	1313400	Anything that's not Harmon.
1313400	1314400	Oh, because I'm an ouslander?
1314400	1315400	Yeah, yeah.
1315400	1317400	But that doesn't mean they don't accept you.
1317400	1318400	They're protective of me.
1318400	1319400	They're scared.
1319400	1320400	You might go for my throat.
1320400	1321400	I understand.
1321400	1327400	I had a dog when I was a kid that bit a guy because he was throwing away newspapers
1327400	1331400	and he was holding a wire and he was protecting my brother and we had to put it down.
1331400	1332400	Oh, no.
1332400	1334400	Okay, let's move on.
1335400	1338400	Did that story really end with the death of a beloved dog?
1338400	1339400	Yeah, it did.
1339400	1341400	Fuck, you're brave like Disney.
1341400	1343400	But then there were puppies.
1343400	1345400	When we got home, there were puppies.
1345400	1347400	We bought a zoo.
1349400	1350400	We bought a zoo.
1350400	1353400	Beethoven, get off the couch.
1355400	1358400	You are never more than five minutes in the movie, we bought a zoo,
1358400	1361400	from a character shrugging and saying, we bought a zoo.
1361400	1363400	I just want you to know that.
1363400	1366400	And that is never a sign of a confidently written film.
1367400	1371400	Imagine if you were watching Star Wars and every five minutes someone just went,
1371400	1373400	Star Wars.
1375400	1376400	They never said it once.
1376400	1378400	Citizen Kane never was.
1378400	1379400	No one ever went.
1379400	1380400	Citizen Kane?
1380400	1381400	Real Citizen Kane.
1381400	1383400	You're fired, Citizen Kane.
1385400	1387400	Dan, what compelled you to buy that movie?
1387400	1389400	Because first of all, I've never heard of it.
1389400	1390400	Second of all, what the fuck?
1390400	1392400	We went through every fucking movie ever.
1392400	1396400	We watched Savages with Travolta.
1396400	1397400	We watched...
1397400	1398400	Safe House.
1398400	1399400	Safe House 8.
1399400	1401400	Which one's Safe House?
1402400	1404400	It's everyone and it's no one.
1404400	1405400	Asked a weird D&D character?
1406400	1407400	I don't know, man.
1407400	1412400	I know, we walked away from Portland $177 into bad Hollywood.
1413400	1414400	They got us.
1414400	1415400	The house won.
1416400	1417400	You bought these or rented these?
1417400	1418400	Well, I don't know.
1419400	1420400	What do you call it?
1420400	1421400	At the hotel.
1421400	1422400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1422400	1423400	I got you.
1423400	1426400	I rented a lot of movies while Dan was sleeping.
1426400	1428400	And he woke up till we bought a zoo.
1428400	1429400	It's not about me.
1429400	1431400	Dungeons and Dragons.
1432400	1433400	We bought a zoo.
1433400	1434400	We bought a zoo.
1435400	1436400	That's fine.
1436400	1438400	It's fine that you bought a zoo.
1438400	1440400	The problem is then you made a movie about it.
1440400	1442400	And I'm watching it.
1443400	1445400	You have my money.
1445400	1447400	We bought a zoo.
1447400	1449400	Dan was half asleep during the entire movie.
1449400	1452400	I was just waking up in like a fever dream saying,
1452400	1453400	bought a zoo?
1454400	1455400	And then back asleep.
1455400	1456400	Say it one more time.
1456400	1459400	Because there was no conflict in the movie.
1459400	1460400	They bought a zoo.
1462400	1464400	If you mapped it on my story circle,
1464400	1467400	six of the eight points on the circle would say,
1467400	1469400	we bought a zoo.
1470400	1471400	Wow.
1471400	1472400	To be fair.
1472400	1473400	In the middle of the film,
1473400	1476400	the truth that they arrive at is that they bought a fucking zoo.
1478400	1482400	To be fair, that movie was written using a story puddle.
1483400	1485400	Halfway through, do they lose the zoo?
1485400	1486400	No.
1486400	1487400	No.
1487400	1490400	Halfway through, they said we bought a zoo,
1490400	1492400	which they bought on page 10.
1492400	1496400	They fucking bought it and then they just sat on it and ran it.
1498400	1499400	Well, a tiger died.
1499400	1501400	So they kept contriving things.
1501400	1504400	This is based on a true story about, guess what?
1504400	1506400	They bought a fucking zoo and nothing happened.
1506400	1509400	It's based on a true story about going to the dry cleaner.
1509400	1510400	So if you make that a new movie,
1510400	1512400	you have to break it up with contrimences.
1512400	1513400	It rains in the movie.
1513400	1515400	It rains for days.
1515400	1516400	It's not going to rain.
1516400	1519400	They're sitting there, these writers are going,
1519400	1521400	what is the enemy of a zoo?
1523400	1526400	What's the mecca Godzilla to a zoo's Godzilla?
1528400	1529400	Rain.
1529400	1530400	Rain.
1530400	1531400	I never go to the zoo when it rains.
1531400	1532400	God damn it, Prescott.
1532400	1533400	You're a genius.
1534400	1536400	But okay, how do you get rid of rain?
1536400	1537400	How do you get rid of rain?
1537400	1538400	Wait a while.
1539400	1540400	Sir, you wait.
1540400	1542400	And then it stops raining after a while.
1542400	1543400	God damn it, you're right.
1544400	1545400	And that's what happens.
1545400	1546400	It rains for a while.
1546400	1547400	Then it stops raining.
1547400	1549400	Then there's a tree in the road.
1549400	1551400	Then the people find out they can walk around the tree.
1551400	1553400	I'm not exaggerating.
1553400	1557400	And every time one of these contrived high points happens,
1557400	1560400	they cue this like a weem, a white, a weem.
1560400	1563400	They're just this fucking shitty African,
1563400	1565400	like Paul Simon shit.
1565400	1569400	It's just designed to don't worry, be happy, you're aorta.
1569400	1573400	It just goes in your chest like an invasive...
1575400	1578400	African people just chanting things at random.
1578400	1579400	Dan, who's the bad guy?
1579400	1580400	Who's the bad guy?
1582400	1584400	You for watching it.
1585400	1586400	And I'm not kidding.
1586400	1587400	That's clever.
1587400	1589400	Because the movie keeps jabbing you in the ribs and going,
1589400	1592400	why aren't you crying, you scrooge?
1592400	1594400	Why aren't you crying like everyone in the movie?
1594400	1596400	They bought a zoo, you dick.
1596400	1598400	No one comes in and goes like,
1598400	1600400	nice place for a zoo.
1601400	1603400	Or an oil well.
1603400	1604400	Yeah, exactly.
1604400	1605400	No, no, no, no.
1605400	1608400	The last person who put one here sank into an enormous crater.
1608400	1612400	No, that's one of six things missing from the story.
1612400	1615400	Is a guy going like, yeah, you know what's under this zoo?
1615400	1616400	Diamonds.
1616400	1617400	Right.
1617400	1618400	Blood diamonds.
1618400	1620400	Lion killing blood diamonds.
1620400	1621400	Right.
1621400	1624400	We're going to have blind children come in and dig them out with toothbrushes.
1625400	1626400	But the lions will eat them.
1626400	1628400	That's the point.
1628400	1629400	But I thought you wanted the diamonds.
1629400	1630400	I'm high.
1632400	1633400	You're the bad guy and you're high?
1633400	1634400	Yes.
1635400	1636400	I didn't buy a zoo.
1638400	1639400	Honey, I just woke up.
1640400	1641400	We didn't buy a zoo.
1641400	1642400	No, you did.
1642400	1643400	You bought a zoo.
1643400	1644400	I just woke up a third time.
1644400	1645400	It's like Inception.
1646400	1647400	Zoo.
1649400	1650400	We bought a dream zoo.
1651400	1652400	Dream zoo.
1653400	1655400	The zoo conspiracy and the zoo.
1656400	1657400	The lion was the architect.
1658400	1660400	It was the lion's dream the whole time.
1661400	1662400	You're in the zoo.
1662400	1663400	Yeah.
1665400	1666400	We bought a zoo.
1666400	1669400	They shrug and they say we bought a zoo a million times.
1670400	1671400	All right.
1671400	1672400	So we've gone on.
1672400	1674400	I don't want to get off on any tangents tonight.
1675400	1679400	Dan, I think if at any point this train jumps the tracks,
1679400	1681400	like during Hermitown, you could just say,
1681400	1682400	I got a podcast.
1682400	1683400	I got a podcast.
1683400	1684400	I bought a podcast.
1684400	1685400	I got a Hermitown.
1685400	1686400	I got a microphone.
1686400	1687400	I got a town.
1687400	1690400	Oh, you know, Kettle One tweeted me today.
1691400	1692400	And?
1692400	1694400	Well, I'm just saying in a world where we're doing sponsor bits,
1694400	1696400	you know, I have a relationship with Kettle One,
1696400	1698400	both internally and externally.
1699400	1701400	I have a fundamental relationship with Kettle One
1701400	1703400	in that it's the spinach to my Popeye.
1703400	1705400	You have respiratory alcoholism.
1706400	1709400	And then now I have my Twitter buddy.
1710400	1711400	I don't know.
1711400	1712400	I'm just saying.
1712400	1713400	Sorry.
1713400	1715400	Are you saying we should drop Nike as our unofficial sponsor?
1715400	1719400	If you have fun tonight, it may be indirectly the result of Kettle One.
1720400	1721400	I can almost guarantee it.
1721400	1722400	Can I?
1722400	1724400	I have some copy written down from a Nike shoe.
1724400	1726400	Why don't we just plug a new Kettle One?
1726400	1727400	Give it a shot.
1727400	1728400	A new Kettle One shoe.
1728400	1729400	Yeah.
1729400	1730400	Give it a shot.
1730400	1731400	Kettle One Tiempo.
1731400	1735400	Combining the perfect blend of comfort and superior ball feel.
1736400	1738400	I'm just going to stop there.
1738400	1739400	Ball, ball view?
1739400	1740400	Ball feel.
1740400	1741400	Oh, ball feel.
1741400	1742400	I adore that.
1742400	1745400	When you're hunting a dragon, there's nothing more relaxing.
1745400	1746400	Great.
1747400	1749400	Greg, how would you like to combine the perfect blend of comfort
1749400	1751400	and superior ball feel?
1751400	1752400	Would I?
1752400	1756400	It's like reading Balzac while lying in a bowl of pudding.
1757400	1761400	The Kettle One Tiempo Legend 4 Elite is designed for the ultimate touch.
1767400	1768400	I heard that.
1768400	1771400	You can't make a shoe and say ball feel.
1771400	1774400	Spencer, distribute the character sheets.
1774400	1776400	Can you pass this down to Jeff?
1778400	1781400	Spencer is now distributing our Dungeons and Dragons character sheets.
1781400	1784400	This is that point in each episode that all you ladies look forward to.
1785400	1786400	It's our...
1786400	1787400	What the fuck is this?
1789400	1790400	Who's Jeff?
1791400	1792400	I'm Cork.
1792400	1793400	Pass it all to Jeff.
1793400	1795400	Yeah, pass those ones to Jeff.
1795400	1796400	Oh, okay.
1796400	1798400	You don't have one yet.
1798400	1799400	I'll give you one.
1799400	1800400	Oh, he's going to give you one.
1800400	1801400	Thank you, Spencer.
1801400	1803400	You have to be woven into the tapestry of our fate.
1803400	1804400	Okay.
1805400	1807400	Many thanks to you, weary traveler,
1807400	1811400	and I hope that upon the path we travel, good fortune will find you.
1812400	1814400	Holy shit, we're going to get this guy in the game.
1817400	1819400	Are you sure you haven't played this before?
1819400	1820400	Are you a ringer?
1820400	1821400	Not professionally.
1823400	1825400	I quit right before it went pro.
1826400	1829400	Are you going to produce a lion-headed cane from your coat?
1829400	1831400	It is to be fervently wished.
1831400	1833400	All right, McGathey, what was your character's name?
1833400	1837400	I only know it's like one of the most forgettable, slippery...
1837400	1839400	Dear sir, I am Moray and Sedana.
1839400	1840400	Ha ha, adventure.
1840400	1842400	Moray, Moray and Sedana?
1842400	1843400	Oh.
1843400	1844400	Kippedata.
1844400	1845400	Mool Rayne Sedana.
1845400	1846400	Mool Rayne.
1846400	1847400	Okay.
1847400	1851400	But I be whatever you'd like, for I am half-elf, half-human,
1851400	1853400	and all pleasure.
1854400	1855400	Wow.
1856400	1857400	All right.
1858400	1859400	Spencer?
1859400	1863400	All right, so when we last met,
1863400	1867400	you had found Morayne trying to find the...
1867400	1868400	or when you were looking at the sign,
1868400	1871400	you decided that you should kill this ember mauler
1871400	1873400	that's been wreaking havoc on the town.
1873400	1874400	Oh, right.
1874400	1876400	I saw a sign in the tavern that was like a lion creature.
1876400	1879400	That's been killing cats and dogs and people and stuff?
1879400	1881400	Yeah, it's been killing some things
1881400	1883400	and burning some crops and causing some havoc.
1883400	1886400	So you were in the tavern making sure that...
1886400	1887400	Are we in Calabasas?
1887400	1889400	Where are we right now?
1890400	1892400	It's the city of Thornvale.
1893400	1894400	To be sure.
1895400	1897400	Not that fell place.
1897400	1899400	I met an oath I would never return there.
1899400	1902400	But Greg, didn't you used to do comedy there?
1902400	1904400	Yeah, I played the palace.
1906400	1909400	There's two times in your career you play Thornvale.
1909400	1912400	One's on the way up and one's on the way down.
1913400	1915400	It is so nice to be back.
1918400	1919400	Holy shit.
1919400	1921400	He doesn't even have his character seat yet.
1921400	1923400	I'm here in the field.
1923400	1925400	I fight for my meals.
1928400	1930400	Oh, shit.
1933400	1936400	So, deciding to join forces, you retired to the tavern
1936400	1939400	and it is now the morning and you're waking up in your rooms.
1939400	1942400	You old prancing pony, what's the name of the tavern, do we now?
1942400	1943400	Cha-cha-cha's tavern.
1943400	1944400	Cha-cha's tavern now.
1944400	1946400	Cha-cha's?
1946400	1949400	All I know is I went into a berserker rage,
1949400	1951400	we killed a pig, I woke up in the morning
1951400	1954400	and there was a homophobic elf hanging out with us.
1955400	1957400	Not homophobic, sir.
1957400	1960400	Encouraging of new love.
1960400	1961400	A gardener.
1961400	1963400	Yeah, but he told you that we're not a couple.
1963400	1968400	Spencer, as per an agreement that I decided we had
1968400	1971400	between these two rounds, we're all meeting for breakfast
1971400	1973400	down in the common room.
1974400	1976400	All right, in the common room of a pub,
1976400	1979400	you seem to notice an air of discomfort.
1979400	1981400	Yeah, between Jeff and Aaron.
1981400	1982400	I mean, Quark.
1982400	1985400	Quark and mole rain.
1989400	1992400	There appears to have been a fire the night previous
1992400	1995400	and people think it might be resulting
1995400	1997400	from the Ember Mauler's assault.
1997400	1999400	Oh, a fire in the town?
1999400	2001400	Yeah, some people are talking,
2001400	2003400	you hear people talk about fires in the pub.
2003400	2004400	What's this town's name?
2004400	2005400	Thornvale.
2005400	2006400	Thornvale.
2006400	2009400	Finally, a conflagration has consumed that cursed place.
2010400	2012400	Wait, who's this guy?
2012400	2015400	Wait, Sharpie butts a lot.
2015400	2017400	Me thinks we have a new member to our team here.
2017400	2020400	Our voice speakers from the table yawn.
2021400	2023400	Is that true?
2023400	2025400	Is he just a disembodied voice?
2025400	2026400	He's a disembodied voice.
2026400	2027400	Oh, shit.
2027400	2031400	I am Percocet, the giver of feelings that are wild.
2034400	2036400	My humblest apology, Sharpie.
2036400	2038400	I slept very hard last night.
2038400	2039400	Yeah.
2039400	2042400	Dear poof, now that you're awake,
2042400	2045400	may I offer my apology for suggesting
2045400	2047400	that there is a romantic relationship
2047400	2048400	between you and butts a lot?
2048400	2049400	I was asleep.
2049400	2050400	I just heard about it.
2051400	2053400	Well, either way, I apologize.
2053400	2055400	I love happiness and balloons.
2055400	2056400	I'm like a rainbow.
2056400	2058400	You don't know where I start or end.
2059400	2060400	Balloons don't exist.
2060400	2061400	Gentlemen, please.
2063400	2065400	My character sighs loudly.
2069400	2071400	We have lately just rode in.
2071400	2074400	Who must one fillet in order to obtain ale in this shithole?
2074400	2077400	Sharpie, I say we out into the streets
2077400	2079400	and conquer this deadly beast
2079400	2083400	that be forting the cats and dogs of Thornvale.
2083400	2085400	We out into the streets, Spencer.
2085400	2087400	You see the scene of a fire.
2087400	2089400	It's a farmhouse, or was.
2091400	2092400	Nice.
2092400	2093400	Nice.
2096400	2097400	Sharpie.
2098400	2100400	Me thinks we are in business.
2101400	2103400	I like that he didn't want to roll the dice
2103400	2105400	at making the pause.
2105400	2106400	He didn't want to take a dramatic pause.
2106400	2107400	He was like, fuck these guys.
2107400	2110400	They talk about, give them an inch of leeway.
2110400	2112400	It was a farmhouse, or was.
2114400	2115400	It's just good writing.
2115400	2117400	If he paused, one of us would talk for 10 minutes.
2119400	2120400	A farmhouse?
2120400	2121400	More like a carmhouse.
2124400	2125400	We bought a farmhouse.
2128400	2131400	What are we going to do with all these domesticated animals?
2132400	2134400	I hope there's no dampness.
2135400	2138400	I examine the remains of the farmhouse, Spencer.
2138400	2141400	You see an old man crying over the remains of his farmhouse.
2142400	2144400	I'm not good at language.
2144400	2146400	Sharpie, you want to talk to the old man?
2148400	2150400	Oh, Greg can play the old man.
2150400	2151400	You can play the old man, yeah.
2152400	2154400	The old man appears to be of a non-human race.
2169400	2171400	I check my inventory for lozenges.
2174400	2176400	Elderly gentlemen, I...
2181400	2182400	I cast Ricola.
2192400	2194400	Ricola's faithful lozenge.
2200400	2204400	Elder one, I don't know this Andy Kaufmanesque tongue of which you speak.
2205400	2208400	I only want to express my sympathy for the loss of your home
2208400	2212400	and inquire as to how it became so destroyeth.
2220400	2221400	Amber mauler?
2221400	2222400	What were they called?
2222400	2223400	What?
2223400	2225400	The people who set fire to the goddamn village.
2225400	2226400	Amber mauler, yeah.
2226400	2227400	Amber mauls?
2227400	2228400	Yeah.
2228400	2229400	The ember mauler.
2230400	2231400	The ember maul de bosto.
2231400	2233400	The ember maul de hando.
2233400	2235400	The ember maul de hando.
2235400	2238400	Jeff, Quark, I understand one word.
2238400	2239400	Yeah.
2239400	2241400	This guy's saying and it's the same word on the poster in the tavern.
2241400	2242400	This ember mauler.
2242400	2243400	Ember mauler.
2244400	2246400	No, it's not for the ember mauler.
2247400	2248400	Old man.
2248400	2250400	It's like Tony Shalhoub in Quick Change.
2251400	2253400	Tony Shalhoub, you know him?
2254400	2256400	I love him in Quick Change movie.
2257400	2258400	Old man.
2259400	2262400	Old, older dwarf homosexual.
2264400	2265400	Aye, aye.
2266400	2267400	Ah, full of pleasure.
2267400	2269400	As always, as always.
2269400	2271400	I like a good fight when I can find one.
2271400	2273400	Did you see which way this beast went?
2273400	2274400	Passo.
2274400	2276400	Kentado.
2276400	2278400	Pesso di di dragon.
2279400	2281400	He said pass the dragon.
2282400	2283400	Spencer is it?
2283400	2285400	We have to pass a dragon to get to the thing?
2285400	2288400	You can pass or you can do what the fuck you like.
2291400	2293400	He's holding a baguette.
2293400	2294400	Let's take his baguette.
2295400	2296400	And he has a penguin on his head.
2296400	2297400	Wait a minute.
2298400	2301400	Spencer, is any of what we're saying true?
2301400	2305400	Yeah, he motions to the west and points in a direction.
2305400	2306400	Penchill.
2307400	2310400	Well, are you guys ready to head west?
2310400	2311400	Get this ember mauler.
2312400	2316400	Mulrein, being a ranger, can track the beast if she can successfully do that.
2317400	2319400	Ha, of course I can successfully do that.
2320400	2324400	I'll go pack up our bags and our treasure that we got last night and we'll away.
2326400	2328400	Oh, he wants a tip.
2328400	2329400	No, no, no.
2329400	2330400	He wants a tip.
2331400	2334400	It's customary to tip people after asking them about their pajamas.
2334400	2335400	Here's four coppers.
2335400	2338400	I give the old man four coppers.
2339400	2342400	I give the old man a bag of dirt.
2344400	2348400	And I give him a promise that his children will walk upon the rainbows.
2350400	2351400	Miss Gorson.
2353400	2355400	You're not your two friends at Douchebag.
2356400	2357400	I'm sorry.
2358400	2361400	Hey, as we walked on the road, I whispered to Sharpie,
2361400	2363400	was that guy Jewish, Italian, French?
2364400	2366400	That character was a real Ural pass.
2368400	2369400	I am doing Christ of Lumberjt.
2370400	2371400	Oh, he can hear us.
2371400	2372400	He can hear us.
2372400	2373400	My hearing is acute.
2374400	2375400	I am not acute.
2375400	2376400	My hearing is acute.
2376400	2377400	I am also Chico Marx.
2382400	2383400	This way, friends.
2383400	2384400	Adventure.
2385400	2386400	We head west.
2386400	2388400	By the way, I thought Mulrein was a dude.
2389400	2390400	Mulrein's a dude, yeah.
2390400	2391400	I am a dude.
2391400	2392400	Did I say Shima?
2392400	2393400	Sorry, guys.
2393400	2394400	Seems sorry, audience.
2394400	2395400	I'm so attractive.
2396400	2399400	Sometimes I appear to be a woman because I'm so beautiful.
2400400	2401400	Spencer.
2401400	2402400	Spencer, how are we traveling?
2402400	2403400	By foot?
2403400	2404400	On horse, how are we going?
2404400	2405400	You're walking on foot.
2405400	2409400	Mulrein's leading the path, bending over and looking at all sorts of signs
2409400	2411400	and symbols of possible animals.
2411400	2412400	This way.
2412400	2413400	Regard my asshole.
2415400	2417400	You come upon the remains of a burned field.
2418400	2419400	The path seems to stop.
2421400	2422400	No one walk on this field.
2422400	2423400	It's burned.
2424400	2425400	Stop.
2425400	2427400	Well, that means the Mulrein must have been here.
2427400	2428400	The Ember Mauler.
2428400	2429400	Ember Mauler.
2429400	2430400	Mulrein is...
2432400	2433400	That's Ember Maul.
2433400	2434400	Oh, my God, he followed us.
2435400	2437400	He's like a homeless guy in Korea town.
2437400	2438400	Shoo!
2438400	2439400	Shoo!
2440400	2441400	Shoo!
2441400	2443400	Four coppers, you cheap son of a bitch.
2443400	2444400	Oh, man.
2444400	2446400	Spencer, I pick up a stick.
2450400	2452400	I throw the stick back toward the town.
2453400	2454400	That's right, I'm going.
2456400	2459400	But don't say I didn't warn you.
2459400	2461400	Now he's from Puerto Rico?
2461400	2462400	What the hell is going on?
2464400	2467400	I am John Lithgow in Buckaroo Banzai.
2470400	2471400	You like sandwiches?
2473400	2474400	All right, we're in a burnt field.
2474400	2475400	All right.
2475400	2477400	I investigate the field.
2477400	2481400	After the old man leaves, you turn around to investigate the field
2481400	2484400	and notice that a white horse has been trotting into view.
2484400	2489400	But no normal white horse was this, for it was a unicorn.
2491400	2492400	Holy shit.
2492400	2494400	Do you know how rare these things are?
2494400	2495400	A choo!
2495400	2498400	The unicorn bends down and touches its horn
2498400	2501400	to what looks like a charred dead rabbit.
2501400	2504400	You see a blinding flash of light and a healthy rabbit.
2505400	2506400	Boing, boing, boing.
2506400	2508400	And bounces into the underbrush.
2508400	2510400	That's not there because it's a burnt field.
2510400	2511400	It brought the rabbit back to life?
2511400	2513400	It seemed to bring the rabbit back to life.
2513400	2514400	Chirpy!
2516400	2517400	Neil Sadaka!
2519400	2520400	I make myself!
2520400	2521400	Mulrain Muldoon?
2524400	2525400	I?
2525400	2526400	Yes?
2527400	2530400	That horse just touched a dead rabbit and it came back to life.
2530400	2531400	That's no horse quirk.
2531400	2532400	It's no horse.
2532400	2533400	That's what he said.
2535400	2536400	It's a unicorn.
2537400	2538400	All right.
2539400	2540400	It's a horse with one horn.
2540400	2541400	It's a unicorn.
2541400	2542400	It's a unicorn.
2543400	2545400	I am Tylenol with codeine.
2547400	2551400	And a warm sense of well-being should imbue your body with my very presence.
2551400	2552400	See the rabbit?
2552400	2554400	I have brought it back to leopard.
2554400	2555400	What be your name?
2555400	2557400	Tylenol with codeine.
2559400	2561400	I thought you just said you were high on codeine.
2561400	2563400	No, I'm Tylenol with codeine.
2563400	2566400	I'm the good kind of Tylenol, not the disappointing kind.
2567400	2571400	Dear unicorn, why this rabbit and not the entire field?
2571400	2572400	I am selective.
2577400	2578400	I respect this.
2578400	2581400	Tylenol, did you see the ember mauler that did this?
2581400	2582400	The ember maul.
2582400	2585400	Oh, they are most evil.
2585400	2587400	Much havoc have they wrought upon the land.
2587400	2592400	I used to prance freely amongst the daisies and gladiolas, the snapdragons and the...
2592400	2593400	What are those little purple ones?
2593400	2594400	I love those.
2595400	2596400	Two lips.
2596400	2598400	No, I have not met you.
2599400	2608400	And yet, the ember maul, much havoc have reeked, and they must be stoppered, for this land was once pure.
2610400	2614400	Now it is fouled with the horrible stench of their enormous wands.
2615400	2616400	Have you seen...
2616400	2618400	Have you done battle with them before?
2618400	2623400	Seen them, I have smelt them from kilometers away, for my senses are most highly developed.
2623400	2626400	I would say acute, but the old man used it earlier.
2627400	2633400	Sharpie, I care not to do battle alongside this winged horse who speaketh so fruitily.
2634400	2638400	Fruitily I speaketh, thou art a basket of raspberries thyself.
2640400	2645400	Why dost thou not give me thy name, O Jamba Juice, and I will inform you when your cup is ready.
2645400	2651400	Oh, ooh, white stallion I shall disembowel thee with my sword for words so important.
2651400	2653400	Quark!
2653400	2658400	Take it easy, unicorns are very powerful, he could make a most unlikely ally.
2658400	2661400	Pift he threatens not your love.
2661400	2663400	Are thou but half elf?
2663400	2664400	Yes.
2664400	2667400	I am half elf, and I can speak for myself.
2670400	2674400	Indeed, thine companions art most sexist.
2675400	2682400	Aye, I agree, sir, but it matters not, for I am like the breeze, I flow and pleasure.
2684400	2686400	Like the wind thou dost blow.
2687400	2697400	Aye, unicorn, may I become your ally and ride you, or you can ride me, although my back will break, but I want to not be a unicornist.
2697400	2705400	Indeed, elf, let thoust may mount me while thine friends trail behind and step away from my stool in a haphazard manner.
2707400	2709400	Ha ha ha! Adventure!
2712400	2714400	Well, how do you like that?
2717400	2720400	Listen, maybe we should split up.
2721400	2728400	What is that ahead? I see an emerald light. Is it not true, Spencer, who holdeth the book?
2729400	2737400	On the horizon, you see a light. It seems to be a fire, but it is not spreading. It does appear to be coming closer.
2737400	2740400	Uh-oh, I see embermauler headlights.
2742400	2743400	Possibly.
2743400	2749400	Indeed, for the emdermaul, embermaul, I have mispronounced it.
2749400	2760400	Listen, gang, if this beast is as dangerous as its wake of destruction has suggested, it might be prudent for us to find a hiding spot and wait until it gets here.
2760400	2762400	You sound unsure.
2762400	2764400	I'm just a little sharpie.
2764400	2770400	You told me last night that you, or this morning rather, that you'd found a crystal of the greatness of something?
2771400	2773400	Might that be of any value to us?
2773400	2775400	Possibly, yeah.
2776400	2779400	Oh, dickless human!
2781400	2797400	Who, like one oviparous, strode behind me when thou'st might have mounted if thou had objected in any way. Wouldst thou not use thine talisman? For I have the power to detect evil.
2797400	2798400	Yeah.
2798400	2800400	And evil I do detect.
2801400	2804400	You detect evil coming from the direction of the fire.
2804400	2807400	Oh, shit, ball McGee.
2808400	2812400	Dost thou wish to bone out, or dost thou wish to grow a pair?
2812400	2816400	Would there be any visual cover in this area? Where are we?
2816400	2821400	There's some large rocks and some skeletal burnt trees to your right.
2821400	2823400	Let's hide behind those rocks, you guys.
2823400	2841400	As a creature with wild empathy, I wish to approach the light for I feel for the light. I too burn inside with a green light, albeit not exactly a green light, but I wish to approach the light.
2841400	2845400	You wish to approach the fire. It burns closer.
2845400	2858400	You can see it is getting close enough to make out, and it is not just a fire, but the form of a powerful feline. It seems to be the size of a lion, but with a flaming mane and twin tails made of fire.
2858400	2860400	Was I clear about hiding behind a rock?
2860400	2867400	Yeah, you're behind a rock. She's walking towards this. The unicorn determined that it was absolutely evil.
2867400	2872400	Moldain by the tears of Solderand, hide yeself!
2872400	2884400	I would like to say that my character has also read the Great Gatsby, so I'm intrigued by the green light. I head towards it.
2884400	2887400	Caution I would use.
2887400	2895400	Dear Unicorn, you have been the greatest friend to me, and a kindred spirit indeed. Shall I back away from the light?
2895400	2899400	Nay, thou must seek thine own destiny, the danger with naught.
2899400	2903400	Oh, you are like a rock covered in candy, hard and sweet.
2903400	2912400	You are like Sammy Hagar, and canst not thou drive fifty-five.
2912400	2918400	The embermal approaches. Shall you face it head-on, or shall you lay an ambush?
2918400	2922400	Oui. I am an elf-human.
2922400	2926400	Sharpie, you are titular leader of this group of headless worms.
2926400	2930400	That's why I'm behind a rock.
2930400	2933400	I call Dr. Sharpie for advice. Sharpie!
2933400	2938400	Get behind a rock!
2938400	2943400	Go straight at him!
2943400	2944400	Just do it!
2944400	2948400	A fuck of cluster this be.
2948400	2951400	Aren't there no leaders amongst this group?
2951400	2955400	If it's me, everyone's behind a rock.
2955400	2960400	Hey, Muldane, don't you have arrows? Fire a couple of those off.
2960400	2961400	Dum-dum.
2961400	2963400	Thank you.
2963400	2971400	Thank you, sir. I shall not take dum-dum personally. I fire off fourteen arrows.
2971400	2976400	All right. Well, you can only fire off a couple at a time.
2976400	2981400	Well, I fire off two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two.
2981400	2984400	Fourteen.
2984400	2987400	Seven times has she let her bow sing against the air.
2987400	2992400	If she's doing that, I hide behind a rock seven times.
2992400	2998400	Seven times has thou cowered like a gerbil's garbles.
2998400	3003400	Also, I put a bedroll on my head.
3003400	3010400	Unable to see, you fire an arrow wildly.
3010400	3014400	It flies past, quark, and lands harmlessly in the ash dirt.
3014400	3016400	Oh, man.
3016400	3018400	The Ember Mauler draws closer.
3018400	3023400	It seems to see that you're there, firing arrows with a bedroll on your head.
3023400	3026400	I jump out from behind the rock. I have the power to intimidate, do I not?
3026400	3029400	You do, but this is a fearsome beast.
3029400	3034400	I get back behind the rock.
3034400	3036400	I had a rush of blood to the head.
3036400	3041400	Your intimidation does not last very long, and you are soon quickly found behind the rock again.
3041400	3051400	I present a torch to see what the green fire light is.
3051400	3053400	Did I say it was green?
3053400	3055400	This is a bad idea, everyone. I thought you did.
3055400	3057400	I don't think I did, sorry.
3057400	3061400	Well, the elf human's mind is imaginative.
3061400	3063400	Also, it's my birthday party.
3063400	3068400	I have a check mark behind the skill to handle animal.
3068400	3071400	Yeah, this is a magical creature. It doesn't work like an animal.
3071400	3078400	Sorry, back behind the rock. I dropped my wallet over there.
3078400	3083400	You hear a ferocious roar and a burst of superheated air rushes past the rock.
3083400	3085400	You can tell that it's very close.
3085400	3089400	Jesus Christ, wait, is it targeting us?
3089400	3091400	Yeah, it's been coming towards you.
3091400	3094400	Sharpie, use your magic, man.
3094400	3098400	I'm a barbarian gnome. I've got a sword and a backpack.
3098400	3102400	I needed to wait until a point when there was no choice but to fight.
3102400	3107400	Look, we've all had some drinks. Could everyone stop bitching at one another?
3107400	3111400	Listen, you're a horse. I've been walking your poop for the last 45 minutes, man.
3111400	3114400	My plume is my glory.
3114400	3116400	I said poop.
3116400	3117400	My what?
3117400	3118400	Your poop.
3118400	3120400	Stop talking.
3120400	3122400	Small dwarf-like thing.
3122400	3125400	I cast Summon Monster.
3125400	3127400	All right, what monster would you like to summon?
3127400	3131400	Like an orangutan or a spectral dog?
3131400	3134400	An orangutan's a monster?
3134400	3137400	Look, I bought a zoo last year.
3137400	3141400	I summon an orangutan.
3141400	3144400	A green monkey springs into existence.
3144400	3147400	It charges out from around the rock and engages...
3147400	3150400	You said green, right?
3150400	3155400	No, it wasn't green. Where are you getting this from?
3155400	3156400	Let me get this straight.
3156400	3158400	An orangutan charges around the rock.
3158400	3161400	Guys, just take it easy. This is all going to solve itself.
3161400	3165400	I summon an orangutan. It'll be fine.
3165400	3168400	Just give it a second.
3168400	3170400	You summon an orangutan.
3170400	3173400	I detect evil.
3173400	3176400	My hero.
3177400	3179400	You detect evil on the other side of the rock.
3179400	3184400	You hear the shrieks of an orangutan being dismembered.
3184400	3185400	All right.
3185400	3188400	Way to go, hotshot.
3188400	3190400	There's a method to my madness.
3190400	3193400	What an unwholesome smell.
3193400	3197400	Like bananas on burning petrol.
3197400	3199400	May I summon a magical beast?
3199400	3201400	No, you don't have spells.
3201400	3205400	Why don't we utilize this unicorn that's been following us around the whole time?
3205400	3207400	If you have a spell that I might cast,
3207400	3210400	I will make a magic circle against evil.
3210400	3213400	You create a magic circle around yourself.
3213400	3220400	I will use urine and whirl my member in a helicopter-like motion
3220400	3225400	in an anachronistic movement that has not hitherto yet been seen.
3229400	3232400	Now, no evil may enter this circle of urine,
3232400	3235400	and I apologize for the dampness.
3235400	3237400	Here is a sponge with my likeness upon it
3237400	3240400	that you may purchase for a very small fee.
3240400	3244400	I don't know if good can enter this circle either.
3244400	3246400	It's a bunch of horse pee.
3246400	3250400	Unicorn?
3250400	3253400	It's like being at a Gallagher show.
3253400	3256400	All right, so we're surrounded by an arc of urine.
3256400	3259400	The urine steams on the ground.
3259400	3265400	The ember mauler waltzes across towards you,
3265400	3268400	but it seems stopped by this circle in the ground.
3268400	3272400	He is most gay, and yet he stands frozen.
3272400	3276400	See, I told you, unicorns always have one.
3276400	3279400	The ember mauler whips its fiery tail,
3279400	3284400	and an arc of fire shoots past the barrier right towards Sharpie.
3284400	3288400	Sweet fucking Maria.
3288400	3289400	Can I do anything?
3289400	3291400	I throw my backpack.
3291400	3298400	Throwing your backpack, it catches flames and intercepts the attack.
3298400	3299400	Oh, thank you.
3299400	3300400	Oh, it intercepts that?
3300400	3301400	Yeah, it does.
3301400	3302400	This time.
3302400	3303400	All right.
3303400	3305400	Only had one backpack.
3305400	3309400	Your backpack burns, and its contents are subsumed by fire.
3309400	3312400	How formidable this backpack was.
3312400	3313400	All right, ray of frost.
3313400	3315400	You cast ray of frost.
3315400	3318400	A blinding blue light streams from your fingers
3318400	3320400	directly into the face of the ember mauler.
3320400	3323400	As a cold spell, it does extra damage.
3323400	3324400	Ooh.
3324400	3325400	Ooh.
3325400	3326400	I wonder.
3326400	3329400	I follow up the attack with a berserker rage with my sword.
3329400	3332400	The cold damage does two damage.
3332400	3336400	The spell does two damage to the ember mauler.
3336400	3338400	It recoils in pain.
3338400	3339400	Yeah.
3339400	3341400	I follow up the attack by congratulating Sharpie,
3341400	3343400	for I care for him the most.
3343400	3348400	As the congratulations unfurl, Quark unsheathes his blade
3348400	3352400	and charges across the barrier of urine at the ember mauler.
3352400	3360400	He slices a mighty blow and hits it right in the flank.
3360400	3363400	He feels the heat off the ember mauler's hide,
3363400	3365400	but he can tell that it's been wounded.
3365400	3366400	Yeah.
3366400	3369400	It takes how much damage?
3369400	3370400	Seven damage.
3371400	3373400	How much damage do I take?
3373400	3376400	You take two damage because of the fire on your hands.
3376400	3378400	You're not wearing gloves or any protective equipment.
3378400	3381400	I have the power to cure light wounds.
3381400	3383400	Oh, is that inappropriate at this juncture?
3383400	3384400	No.
3384400	3386400	Would you like to cure those light wounds?
3386400	3388400	Whose wounds are we curing?
3388400	3390400	Quark, the gnome.
3390400	3393400	Although we have had our disagreements in the past,
3393400	3395400	for he is short and barbaric,
3395400	3399400	and I am lithe, white and desirable.
3399400	3401400	I live in a basket of green flowers
3401400	3403400	and promises of butterscotch dons,
3403400	3407400	and he comes from a place of dark green gangrenous swords
3407400	3409400	that are pulled from hideous scabbards.
3409400	3412400	Hey, my hands are burning over here.
3412400	3414400	I will lay my healing powers upon him
3414400	3417400	so that he may know the power of the unicorn.
3420400	3423400	While he's laying his healing powers,
3423400	3426400	I lovingly comb the hair of the unicorn,
3426400	3428400	and he loves it.
3428400	3430400	I wonder might you braid me
3430400	3432400	if it's not too gay at this juncture?
3432400	3436400	Hey, I'm all Dane. Get in the fight.
3436400	3438400	Shoot an arrow or something.
3438400	3440400	I shot 14 arrows?
3440400	3442400	No, you shot an arrow blindly with a bed.
3442400	3445400	Well, everyone, shut up. I'm getting a permanent.
3445400	3446400	A fight's going on.
3446400	3447400	You're combing everybody's hair,
3447400	3449400	and you're complimenting people.
3449400	3451400	That's a certain air of self-warfare
3451400	3455400	in the merry old land of ours.
3455400	3456400	You know a unicorn?
3456400	3458400	I only shot a couple arrows.
3458400	3461400	Can I shoot the rest of the arrows?
3461400	3464400	You can shoot one arrow, yes.
3464400	3467400	Well, fine, Spencer. Shoot an arrow.
3467400	3470400	She's firing an arrow from your bow.
3470400	3473400	You hit the lion straight in the face.
3473400	3479400	The arrow burns, but it is punctured deeply.
3480400	3482400	Who broke my heart?
3482400	3486400	You did, you did, straight to the target, and...
3486400	3487400	Nobody?
3487400	3490400	I shoot another arrow.
3492400	3494400	Spencer, with throwing knives, you're any good?
3494400	3495400	Probably not, right?
3495400	3497400	It is the Ember Mauler's turn.
3497400	3499400	Sorry.
3499400	3502400	Circling around the circle of urine,
3502400	3505400	the Ember Mauler tries to find a weakness.
3505400	3507400	He scratches at the dirt,
3507400	3511400	and some ash slides over the circle of urine,
3511400	3513400	breaking the magic circle.
3513400	3515400	Oh, shit, breach!
3515400	3518400	The Ember Mauler roars.
3518400	3520400	We got Ember Maulers in the wire,
3520400	3522400	Ember Maulers in the wire.
3522400	3525400	I had no idea how tentative my circle of urine was
3525400	3528400	when I swayed it.
3528400	3529400	I don't know if you guys can keep it score,
3529400	3531400	but I just got my ass kicked over there.
3531400	3533400	Assholes and elbows.
3533400	3535400	The Ember Mauler makes a great swipe
3535400	3540400	at Quark's face with a giant flaming claw.
3540400	3543400	It hits you square in the face.
3543400	3546400	Quark!
3546400	3549400	Oh, troll who I have disagreed with.
3549400	3553400	He said gnome, you bitch!
3553400	3555400	You may gnome, but I just met him.
3556400	3560400	Arrrrrrrr!
3560400	3562400	Arrrr!
3562400	3564400	Arrrr!
3564400	3566400	What are you doing?
3566400	3568400	This unicorn's killing!
3568400	3572400	I'm gonna die over here, I know it!
3572400	3574400	Take it easy, man, take it easy.
3574400	3582400	I have the power to cure moderate wounds.
3582400	3586400	Your face I will sit upon
3586400	3589400	and let my magic juices flow.
3589400	3593400	And thus will you be re-appared
3593400	3597400	back to look like Ellie Mae from the Clumpet family.
3597400	3605400	In a possibly not official rage,
3605400	3609400	I cast magic missile at the...
3609400	3611400	Yeah, thank you, man.
3611400	3612400	A lot of fans here.
3612400	3615400	As the unicorn is healing the gnome,
3615400	3617400	your magic missile looses forth
3617400	3619400	and hits the Ember Mauler.
3619400	3621400	And this is like a romantic,
3621400	3626400	like you can see the trembling in my blushing cheeks.
3626400	3628400	There's something going on.
3628400	3631400	There is an homosexual ecstasy in his fighting.
3631400	3634400	No!
3634400	3637400	The missile is bright red with rage.
3637400	3641400	And yet the sperm count is so low.
3641400	3644400	I'm dying over here, you guys!
3644400	3647400	I am sitting on your face as fast as I can.
3647400	3651400	The missile strikes the Ember Mauler for four damage.
3651400	3653400	Oh, alright.
3653400	3655400	Sweet.
3655400	3658400	In later levels I'll be much more powerful.
3658400	3660400	I use my whip.
3660400	3665400	Alright, pulling the whip from your back pocket.
3665400	3666400	Front pocket.
3666400	3668400	It's an actual back pocket.
3668400	3670400	Okay.
3670400	3671400	What?
3671400	3672400	I don't know what's happening, you guys.
3672400	3673400	I'm trying to DM.
3673400	3675400	I don't know.
3675400	3676400	Does she have a whip?
3676400	3677400	Yeah, she has a whip.
3677400	3678400	She's got a whip.
3678400	3679400	She has two magical...
3679400	3682400	She's also got like five backpacks.
3682400	3685400	For all you people who actually care about Dungeons & Dragons,
3685400	3690400	Quall's feather token is a magic item that can turn into a magical whip.
3690400	3691400	Ha ha!
3691400	3693400	And your mom is calling right now.
3693400	3695400	It's time for dinner.
3695400	3697400	Mom!
3697400	3701400	I'm with my friends.
3701400	3703400	I don't bring the hot pockets down here.
3703400	3708400	Alright, you can have them down here once, but you've got to keep it more quiet.
3708400	3712400	I make eye contact with Quark, making sure that things are cool between us.
3712400	3720400	Quark's eyes are blocked by the ass of a large unicorn.
3720400	3721400	My white flanks.
3721400	3726400	My white flanks will issue their healing serum upon your visage.
3726400	3729400	Can you not feel?
3729400	3734400	I'll tell you what, Talon, if I had a nickel.
3734400	3736400	You would have five cents.
3736400	3742400	Note to self, never have moderate wounds.
3742400	3748400	Note to self, always do Johnny Carson.
3748400	3751400	I've got to say, I'm feeling pretty good down here.
3751400	3752400	Of course.
3752400	3755400	What issues from me can only make one feel better.
3755400	3758400	I am Tylenol with Cody N.
3758400	3761400	Hey guys, I've got a unicorn's ass on my head right now,
3761400	3764400	but did you guys kill that Ember Maul yet?
3764400	3765400	Not yet.
3765400	3768400	It has 30 hit points, clearly.
3768400	3772400	Keep using plosives, it feels awesome.
3772400	3777400	Tylenol with Cody, be there any magic in your horn?
3777400	3779400	I beg pardon?
3779400	3781400	In my own world I was for but a moment.
3781400	3784400	What is it, Elflet?
3784400	3789400	I was hoping that you had magic in your horn.
3789400	3791400	Indeed, my horn is spoken of in many lands,
3791400	3795400	and thou doth quake at the very thought of my horn filling one.
3795400	3798400	You know what, while I'm hearing, as he says that Spencer,
3798400	3805400	I look at my sheet and I'd like to handle animal again.
3805400	3809400	I am not an animal, I am a being from beyond your imagination
3809400	3812400	whose power cannot contain your paltry fucking thoughts.
3812400	3815400	Oh, good know me.
3815400	3817400	Yeah, I just rolled the dice and he rolled better than you,
3817400	3819400	so you didn't handle him successfully.
3819400	3822400	There's a fucking monster.
3822400	3824400	What is this, Dick Cavett?
3824400	3827400	The Ember Mauler pounces on Mulrain Sedana.
3827400	3828400	No!
3828400	3830400	Wait, who pounced on you?
3830400	3832400	The Ember Mauler.
3832400	3835400	It's been here for a while.
3835400	3837400	Help me.
3837400	3842400	Guys, let's just wait him out.
3842400	3844400	Good idea, Ganome.
3844400	3846400	Oh, guys, come on.
3846400	3851400	I have a piercing horn, now that you have mentioned it, oh, Elflet.
3851400	3857400	Seeth here, upon this piece of paper handed to me by a young magician,
3857400	3863400	I may attack with my horn, and I bid you all good day.
3863400	3866400	Though I may die against the Elflemore, what's it called?
3866400	3868400	The Ember Mauler.
3868400	3869400	Him too.
3869400	3873400	Both of them will tax my bravery to the utmost,
3873400	3878400	and yet I bid you adieu, oh, Ganome, my flanks say much thanks to you.
3878400	3882400	Oh, Sharpie, the courage I hope you may find within, and Elflet,
3882400	3884400	I leave my heart with you.
3884400	3886400	Indeed, literally, here it is.
3886400	3889400	It's in a small baggie made of Ziploc.
3889400	3895400	And now I will heartily fuck off and pierce this Ember Mauler with my horn.
3895400	3898400	As the Ember Mauler is pouncing on Mulrain Sedana.
3898400	3901400	Someone in the front was yawning copiously right now.
3901400	3905400	I just want you to know that my monologue was like fucking...
3905400	3906400	Yeah.
3906400	3910400	The unicorn plunges its horn deep within the flank of the Ember Mauler.
3910400	3911400	Zorch.
3917400	3918400	Exactly.
3918400	3921400	Dealing 16 damage to the Ember Mauler.
3923400	3926400	Unicorns are powerful magical creatures, you guys.
3926400	3928400	I told you.
3928400	3929400	Tell me about it.
3929400	3931400	It's been sitting on my head for the last half hour.
3931400	3933400	Call me.
3936400	3940400	The Ember Mauler wobbles a bit and then falls over.
3940400	3943400	Flaming blood spews out of its side and sprays...
3943400	3946400	I cast Magic Missile on it to claim credit for the kill.
3946400	3949400	Before it hits the ground, your Magic Missile strikes true.
3949400	3951400	Yeah!
3951400	3954400	You successfully take credit for the kill.
3954400	3957400	Yeah!
3959400	3965400	Sharpie!
3965400	3967400	And Romney takes Ohio.
3974400	3975400	Well...
3975400	3977400	Work I live on.
3977400	3979400	Ha ha!
3979400	3981400	Is everybody okay?
3981400	3983400	I'm not certain.
3983400	3987400	Should we take stock of what happens now?
3987400	3989400	We got a dead Ember Mauler around.
3989400	3990400	Well, let's check it out.
3990400	3992400	Make sure it's dead.
3992400	3996400	As you poke it, its body bursts into flames and is reduced to ashes.
3996400	3999400	Only a bone lower jaw remains.
3999400	4001400	Somebody better take that, it might be worth something.
4001400	4003400	I shall make it a necklace.
4003400	4007400	To bring with us on all our adventures that I will be on.
4009400	4011400	I remain.
4012400	4019400	Well, there was a reward for this posted at the tavern back in Cockville.
4019400	4021400	Chachow Lounge.
4021400	4023400	My dead?
4023400	4024400	No, you're still alive.
4024400	4025400	Oh.
4025400	4026400	Unless you want to be dead.
4026400	4028400	Plus an A.
4028400	4032400	No, Unicorn, only your career has died.
4032400	4038400	I must leave you after this episode, unlike the Elflet, who will stay until time is immeasurable.
4038400	4041400	No, Unicorn, take her away with you.
4041400	4044400	I cannot, for I must go.
4044400	4049400	Many tasks must I perform for those who rule the seventh outermost circle.
4049400	4054400	I wish she much luck, Sharpie, in taking credit for kills in the future.
4054400	4057400	Do you have to leave, fair Unicorn?
4057400	4067400	Fuck off I must, for appetizers are served at happy hour at the Unicorn Applebee's outside of my town, where life is good.
4067400	4072400	Unicorn, please take one of my arrows to remember me by.
4072400	4074400	Do with it what you wish.
4074400	4078400	I will take one of your arrows, braided in my mane, if you will, Elflet.
4078400	4079400	I thank thee.
4079400	4080400	Hi, of course, sir.
4080400	4086400	And you, Ganome, many hours have I sat upon your face, and much memory have I had.
4086400	4090400	For you are like Susie Chopstick, your lips are everlasting.
4093400	4096400	Fuck off I must, and let my cheeks break wind.
4098400	4103400	Wow, look, he's leaving a rainbow trail as he flies away.
4109400	4112400	You can hear him singing.
4112400	4114400	Is he singing word up?
4119400	4123400	Wait, that was no Unicorn, that was Morris Day's the entire time.
4124400	4126400	No matter where you think it, you know it.
4126400	4127400	I'll miss you, Morris Day!
4127400	4129400	Oh, you suck a unicorn.
4129400	4132400	It wasn't Morris Day, it was Cameo.
4132400	4134400	Cameo, fuck, I screwed up.
4134400	4136400	It was Cameo!
4137400	4139400	By the seven moons of Cameo.
4139400	4145400	Let us reflect on how this team of three watched that Unicorn dancing into the sunset.
4145400	4147400	Two and a half.
4148400	4151400	I think we've learned a lot on this adventure.
4152400	4154400	We've learned to get along.
4155400	4157400	We've learned to hide behind rocks.
4157400	4160400	I've learned that Morris Day is not Cameo.
4162400	4168400	That's about it, but we should head back to that town that I keep forgetting the name of.
4169400	4170400	Thornvale.
4170400	4171400	Thornvale.
4171400	4174400	Returning to Thornvale, you meet with Ferris of the Wardens.
4174400	4177400	His name was on the bill to kill the Embermauler.
4178400	4180400	He's at the Wardens' quarters.
4183400	4186400	I am Ferris, and I am mildly disgruntled.
4189400	4193400	Well, your disgruntlement's gonna stop when you find out what we just did.
4194400	4198400	Kill the Embermauler, motherfucker!
4200400	4202400	Who is this jive honky?
4203400	4205400	This is one of my best friends.
4205400	4208400	He's a gnome, barbarian.
4208400	4211400	No Expedia wish I to use this day.
4213400	4218400	We have just come back from slaying the Embermauler.
4218400	4220400	Dost thou shit me?
4220400	4224400	Elf, show him the jawbone to prove the point.
4224400	4226400	She's wearing it as a necklace.
4226400	4231400	I am, and again, I am a man, though I am beautiful and appear to be a woman.
4231400	4233400	Here is the jawbone.
4233400	4238400	Your male beauty is so overpowering, but a semi I did get.
4239400	4240400	Thank you, Ferris.
4240400	4242400	Do you wish to lead a parade through Chicago?
4242400	4243400	Indeed.
4243400	4250400	And I wish to congratulate you, Sharpie, though earlier I was disgruntled alone in this tavern drinking my ale.
4250400	4257400	Thou hast slain the Embermauler, him, who has brought evil upon this land.
4257400	4260400	And I am to give thee this flagon.
4261400	4263400	I take the flagon.
4266400	4269400	And this bag of riches.
4269400	4270400	That's better.
4270400	4272400	1,400 gold pieces to be exact.
4272400	4276400	1,397, but who is counting?
4276400	4279400	There is vigorous to be paid in this town.
4281400	4285400	Quirk, I would like to tell you this is money. Do not try to eat the money.
4285400	4288400	The coins are made of gold and chocolate.
4289400	4291400	I eat the chocolate.
4291400	4296400	All right, that's the end of our D&D campaign chapter.
4299400	4303400	Thank you, Erin McGathey, for playing the part of Mordred.
4303400	4305400	Thank you for letting me thank you.
4305400	4306400	Morgan.
4306400	4308400	More names to play.
4308400	4311400	Yeah, Morgan Sultana.
4311400	4312400	Lorraine Sedana.
4312400	4313400	We'll make a cheat sheet.
4313400	4315400	Just call me M.S.
4316400	4319400	One step ahead of you.
4321400	4323400	Erin McGathey, everybody!
4330400	4333400	And Spencer, everybody, our dungeon master, of course.
4333400	4335400	What a hero.
4336400	4339400	So, how about that Romney?
4339400	4341400	Wow.
4341400	4344400	He's all different than the other candidate.
4344400	4349400	Greg, I met Greg for drinks at before the show, and I said,
4349400	4350400	is there anything you want to talk about?
4350400	4352400	He said, just no politics.
4352400	4355400	Not because he's not a political person, quite the contrary,
4355400	4357400	because he's...
4357400	4359400	You're not a political person.
4359400	4362400	Not because he's not a political person, quite the contrary,
4362400	4364400	because he's...
4364400	4367400	You must be like a...
4367400	4369400	He has a podcast of his own,
4369400	4373400	and so he's either exhausted from the previous one at this time of year
4373400	4376400	or gearing up for another screed.
4376400	4379400	Greg, if you could, like, a la Dungeons & Dragons,
4379400	4385400	create a presidential candidate like a mystical character,
4385400	4387400	what would your presidential candidate be?
4387400	4390400	First, his power would be fudge,
4390400	4393400	because no one doesn't like fudge.
4393400	4398400	Secondly, he would raise the dark cloud that has been visited upon this land
4398400	4403400	and replace it with one of menthol, so that we could all breathe freely.
4403400	4409400	Thirdly, those who are in want would suddenly have the succor that they need
4409400	4415400	and would be able to drink from a cornucopia of delicious peach-scented beverages
4415400	4418400	that would provide all the nutrients they needed.
4418400	4421400	And lastly, health care.
4421400	4424400	That's separate from succor.
4424400	4427400	Oh, no, succor is delicious, but it's not health care.
4427400	4430400	Universal succor we will all receive.
4430400	4434400	Wouldn't that be great if a candidate promised universal succor?
4434400	4436400	He just dodged the issue then.
4436400	4438400	Everyone would talk about health care, but he's like,
4438400	4441400	no, no, succor, that you get.
4441400	4445400	And he just kind of threaded that needle and won.
4445400	4447400	Succor is fine.
4447400	4450400	I'm not saying we should socialize medicine.
4450400	4453400	I'm saying we should socialize succor.
4453400	4457400	You're promising fudge, succor, and the pursuit of happiness.
4457400	4460400	I think the pursuit of happiness is misleading,
4460400	4463400	because there's no consensus on happiness.
4463400	4465400	Some people are happy when they're shooting people in the face.
4465400	4466400	Exactly.
4466400	4470400	If you're a Republican, if there's a bunch of ugly people in a room screaming and shit,
4470400	4472400	you're like, fuck, this is awesome.
4472400	4475400	And then if you're not, you're like, fuck, this is scary.
4475400	4477400	So that's where I come down.
4477400	4480400	This crowd, of course, has been living on D&D and comic books
4480400	4482400	so they don't know what I'm talking about.
4482400	4485400	There's an election this year.
4485400	4486400	That's our politics.
4486400	4487400	It's really complicated, though.
4487400	4489400	It's the basic fact that as primates,
4489400	4492400	we all just want each other to like each other.
4492400	4496400	And so sometimes it's very easy to just say,
4496400	4498400	hey, whatever makes you happy.
4498400	4502400	And then sometimes we have a very simple answer for exactly what we want,
4502400	4504400	and what makes us happy.
4504400	4509400	And then sometimes the line gets very thin or very wide and very blurry,
4509400	4512400	because what we really want is for everybody to like us.
4512400	4518400	And so sometimes the way you get people to like you is by being unhappy, for instance.
4518400	4523400	We all have friends in this room who are a little more comfortable,
4523400	4526400	depressed, than they are joyful.
4527400	4529400	Sometimes I feel that way.
4529400	4532400	It's kind of Munchausen syndrome where you're like,
4532400	4534400	oh, it could be better.
4534400	4537400	And you feel the love come in, and that's how you get it.
4537400	4541400	And I mean, obviously, it's weird because we're monkeys.
4541400	4544400	Monkeys just want monkeys to...
4544400	4548400	The only thing that we know for sure is that monkeys don't want to be alone.
4548400	4551400	That's the one thing that you can guarantee.
4551400	4553400	I think I've ranted about this before.
4553400	4556400	Like I said, there's documentary about solitary confinement,
4556400	4561400	where they're the most hard-ass fuckers that eat people.
4561400	4568400	They're the most sociopathic, amoral, dysfunctional people.
4568400	4570400	But you put them in solitary confinement,
4570400	4574400	and they immediately act exactly the same way that your dad would act
4574400	4577400	in solitary confinement, or anybody, or Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo.
4577400	4580400	They all act equally tortured and insane,
4580400	4587400	because being cut off from all other people is the only common denominator there is.
4587400	4589400	None of us can handle it.
4589400	4592400	There are all the different things that can go wrong with the human brain.
4592400	4596400	There is no thing, there's no balloon animal you can twist in your skull
4596400	4599400	that makes a human being get into being alone.
4599400	4604400	And we're talking about a world where there's people who like to have shits taken on them.
4604400	4607400	And they smile while it's happening.
4607400	4608400	They're like, that's great.
4608400	4609400	Would you have chili?
4609400	4610400	That's fantastic.
4610400	4615400	But those people, along with everybody else, if you shut them off from society,
4615400	4618400	if you send them off into the woods and say that they're dead to you,
4618400	4626400	they will suffer the same pain as Jeffrey Dahmer and Bill Clinton and Mr. Rogers and anybody.
4626400	4631400	And while that's the only thing, I think, can we start with that and go,
4631400	4634400	okay, if that's the case, then we have something to go on here.
4634400	4640400	We have a close encounter that we can build a language off of.
4640400	4642400	That's our tatanka, is the idea.
4642400	4647400	Hey, you guy with the feathers coming out of your thing and you pierced your cheek
4647400	4650400	and you don't speak the same language as me and you have a completely different language.
4650400	4652400	We all agree.
4652400	4654400	You hate it when you're alone, right?
4654400	4655400	Yeah, I hate it when I'm alone, too.
4655400	4656400	What's the scariest thing in the world?
4656400	4659400	Your mom saying peek-a-boo but never coming back.
4659400	4661400	Yeah, that's what everybody is afraid of.
4661400	4665400	It's like mom covers her face and then her face disappears.
4665400	4669400	And the first laugh you get is she goes, peek-a-boo, and she's back, and so you laugh.
4669400	4673400	But, like, God damn it, what was my point?
4673400	4675400	Mitt Romney should probably be president.
4675400	4677400	I hope I didn't count on you, yeah.
4681400	4687400	Like you said, there are people in the world who are going to be in a room full of horrible, disgusting, nasty people
4687400	4692400	shouting, cut off his head, and money's better, and drill, baby, drill.
4692400	4694400	And they're going to be happy in that room.
4694400	4696400	You can hook them up to a polygraph and say, are you happy?
4696400	4698400	And I think that they pass it.
4698400	4701400	They'd go like, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling good, feeling good tonight.
4701400	4706400	But, like, so there's got to be a way to...
4707400	4709400	I got nothing, I don't know.
4709400	4713400	There's got to be a way to take them through that all the way into, yeah, but then there's no people.
4713400	4715400	Then you're alone.
4715400	4716400	Wouldn't that make you sad?
4716400	4718400	And then they would fail that polygraph test.
4718400	4722400	They wouldn't go, yeah, I'm having a good time here in an island by myself.
4722400	4725400	Because that's the peak of capitalism, too.
4725400	4726400	Like, that's what you do.
4726400	4730400	Your house gets bigger, your yard gets bigger, the barbed wire gets taller.
4730400	4737400	The richer you are, the more allowed you are to just go up to Xanadu and just hang out and not talk to anybody.
4737400	4738400	And be alone.
4738400	4741400	Yeah, and those people go fucking nuts.
4741400	4743400	And then they run for president.
4744400	4747400	But anyways, Greg didn't want to talk about politics tonight.
4747400	4751400	But a couple weeks ago, I did a little screen, and it wasn't really...
4751400	4754400	I'm the laziest brain guy in the world, and I did a little screen about politics.
4754400	4760400	And it was about the idea that, you know, I referred to Osama Obama.
4760400	4762400	I did the same thing.
4763400	4765400	We'll edit it out.
4765400	4766400	Wow.
4768400	4770400	Their names are similar.
4770400	4772400	There's one letter.
4772400	4779400	I referred to the choice between Obama and Romney as the choice between Diet Pepsi and piss.
4781400	4783400	Neither of them is water.
4783400	4785400	Neither of them is what you need.
4785400	4794400	But I ended that rant on a base that might make some of these 25-year-olds think that I was like a libertarian or something.
4794400	4798400	Which is not that either.
4798400	4799400	That's not it.
4799400	4803400	I'm just a big, fat, lazy, tired, sad, cynical fucker.
4803400	4811400	And every four years I go, and I pull the lever for the Democratic candidate just because I don't want to be part of anything bad that happens.
4811400	4814400	But I resent the fact that that's why I'm pulling a lever.
4814400	4818400	And I resent the implication that that's an act of revolution, because it's not.
4818400	4824400	And nothing's ever going to change as long as we keep being convinced that revolution happens behind a curtain booth.
4824400	4827400	That's a scam in itself that we're buying.
4828400	4830400	I think that things need to change a little more.
4830400	4838400	I read that Al Gore is actually coming out and saying, fuck the electoral college.
4838400	4840400	We have to change it completely, right?
4840400	4841400	We have to drop it.
4841400	4844400	Yeah, 12 years after the fact, but yes, he is.
4844400	4847400	If he said it in 2000, it might have been a different day.
4847400	4852400	We're taking it with a grain of salt, Al Gore.
4852400	4855400	He also likes massages quite a lot, is my understanding.
4855400	4858400	Yeah, poor guy.
4858400	4866400	I remember the teachers in my school that all the students liked were always the ones that ended up getting in trouble for making.
4866400	4868400	Smoking dope with him, yeah.
4868400	4869400	That's always the big problem.
4869400	4877400	The brush-cutted guy, the economics teacher and gym coach, he never colored outside the lines.
4877400	4878400	No.
4878400	4879400	He's always fine.
4879400	4883400	No, it was the language arts teacher who smoked pot with the girls who got in trouble later.
4883400	4885400	He would get your head through a window.
4885400	4886400	He would go nuts.
4886400	4887400	He would have a nervous break.
4887400	4889400	And he didn't call you by your last name.
4889400	4892400	Fascism.
4892400	4895400	Sometimes it's the simpler choice.
4895400	4898400	Fascism, the simpler choice.
4898400	4900400	Stop thinking about it.
4900400	4901400	Join us.
4901400	4903400	It's easy to march.
4903400	4909400	It's hard to walk to your own beat.
4909400	4913400	We've had a rash of not knowing how to end the show's last couple of shows.
4913400	4914400	Is this one of those?
4914400	4915400	Ah, sure.
4915400	4918400	Well, if you're asking if I know how to end the show, I'd...
4918400	4920400	You're talking to the wrong person, man.
4920400	4921400	You've never seen one.
4921400	4922400	You don't know what...
4922400	4928400	But I'm loquacious within Garyless, so I don't know how to end a fucking show.
4928400	4929400	Start talking more.
4929400	4931400	We could probably do a...
4931400	4932400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4932400	4933400	Well, yeah, I can't...
4933400	4939400	I'm going to get them started on politics, but I would be happy to end with a patented
4939400	4941400	Proops screed.
4941400	4945400	Gee, that's terrific.
4945400	4946400	Just do one.
4946400	4947400	Do one about crackers.
4947400	4948400	You like crackers?
4948400	4952400	It's a new segment called Great Proops is on the spot.
4952400	4955400	The thing about crackers is...
4955400	4958400	I mean, there's the stone wheat then, but after the first bite, you're like,
4958400	4961400	this could really use some peanut butter or some butter or whatnot,
4961400	4964400	because stone wheat thens are a bit like pretzels.
4964400	4967400	The first bite, you're like, I don't think I'm going to be able to breathe again.
4967400	4969400	There's kind of a windpipe blockage thing.
4969400	4972400	I like Ritz and I like the little ones as well.
4972400	4976400	I do like the European ones, but when you get a Whole Foods and there's a $17 one
4976400	4982400	and it's got a cheese flavor, those are always weak and they fail under the fucking topping.
4982400	4984400	He really did the screen about crackers.
4984400	4985400	He didn't?
4985400	4987400	You asked me to fucking jump in.
4987400	4990400	It's not my fault the crowd's going to stare at the fucking oil paint.
4990400	4991400	I think they were mesmerized.
4991400	4992400	Great.
4992400	4994400	Mesmerized or disappeared?
4994400	4997400	Don't do that thing where you try to force the ending with the applause.
4997400	4998400	We've been through this.
4998400	4999400	I was going to say.
4999400	5000400	I can tell the difference.
5000400	5001400	They did.
5001400	5002400	They tried to end it.
5002400	5006400	Dan, let's just keep throwing them at him until he says he pranked.
5006400	5008400	Crickets, crickets, crickets.
5008400	5010400	Okay, crickets.
5010400	5013400	The thing is, it's a difficult game to understand.
5013400	5017400	I lived in England for five years and you'd watch it on TV and it's really difficult.
5017400	5020400	There's a batsman in a bowl or there's umpires.
5020400	5021400	No, crickets, plural.
5021400	5023400	The insects, the insects.
5023400	5026400	You're being an insect right now by countermanding me.
5026400	5028400	Norwegian fishing.
5028400	5032400	I don't know the first thing about Norwegian fishing, but I do know this.
5036400	5040400	The Norwegians along with the Swiss are the only country in Europe
5040400	5042400	that told the European Union to fuck off.
5042400	5046400	We don't even want to join the EU because we have untold fucking riches.
5046400	5050400	When you go to Norway, and Jeff and I have been to Norway together,
5050400	5053400	and I would say it was with a group of other comedians, but it wasn't.
5053400	5055400	Jeff and I just went as a couple.
5057400	5060400	One weekend we were like, let's fucking go to Norway.
5060400	5063400	Jeff wore red felt and I wore blue.
5063400	5066400	We went to Stavanger, Norway, which is a beautiful place.
5066400	5068400	Oh, the fjords.
5068400	5070400	Oh, the fjords.
5071400	5073400	We laid in a pool together.
5073400	5076400	We ate red deer covered with lingonberries.
5076400	5078400	I had the horse, if you're right.
5078400	5081400	Yeah, Jeff had the horse, which isn't horse in Norwegian.
5081400	5082400	It's like kafunktä.
5082400	5091400	And then the disappointing part about Norway is that there's rarely Chinese food.
5093400	5095400	Chipagol.
5096400	5097400	But the sushi.
5097400	5100400	Oh, the sushi to fucking die for.
5100400	5104400	I don't know if you've ever had seal before, but the pen-a-ped sushi there.
5104400	5106400	No, you haven't had seal.
5106400	5108400	You have not had seal.
5108400	5110400	Not the way they make it in Norway.
5110400	5112400	Because they do a special gravy.
5112400	5114400	Stavanger will fuck up a seal.
5114400	5116400	It falls off the flipper.
5116400	5118400	Yeah, one person will fuck up a fucking seal.
5118400	5120400	Oh, it's chest.
5121400	5124400	You can taste the herring, you know what I mean?
5125400	5128400	It's off the boat, is what it is.
5128400	5130400	It's fully off the boat.
5130400	5132400	It's on the hook and off the boat.
5132400	5133400	What's Jeff's favorite show?
5133400	5134400	Deep Sea Fishing?
5134400	5135400	What's your favorite fucking?
5135400	5136400	Deep Balls.
5136400	5137400	Deadliest Catch.
5137400	5138400	Deep Balls 9.
5138400	5139400	Deep Balls 9.
5139400	5140400	Deep Balls 9.
5140400	5142400	It's on the Hustler channel.
5142400	5145400	It answers the questions from Deep Balls 8.
5148400	5149400	Stupid.
5149400	5150400	So dumb.
5151400	5153400	I like Star Trek, the next penetration.
5154400	5157400	Does that take us to a level that we're like an 8th grade level?
5157400	5159400	You want to play 185 to close?
5159400	5160400	What's that?
5160400	5161400	With accents?
5163400	5164400	No, nothing.
5164400	5166400	That was a comedy sports reference.
5166400	5171400	Greg and I traveled the world doing low level short form improv.
5171400	5173400	But highly successful.
5173400	5176400	And when we were in Norway, fireworks.
5179400	5182400	Greg, we have the two of you.
5183400	5186400	We've learned from previous podcasts that I'm a great beatboxer.
5186400	5190400	And we have the two of you who are professional musical improvisers.
5190400	5192400	I could lay down a beat.
5192400	5194400	You could get a topic.
5194400	5195400	You could do a little rap.
5195400	5198400	It won't be the first time you close the show that way.
5198400	5200400	We'll say goodnight.
5200400	5201400	Yeah, let's get out of here.
5201400	5203400	Kick the beat.
5203400	5205400	And then you'll get the suggestion over the beat like that.
5205400	5206400	Okay, sure.
5206400	5208400	Go on, G.
5208400	5210400	You are an excellent beatboxer.
5210400	5211400	Yeah.
5211400	5213400	Harmontown.
5214400	5215400	In the house.
5215400	5216400	Yo, nerd melt.
5216400	5219400	Yo, Greg, what should we get for a suggestion?
5219400	5221400	Jeff, it's all about freestyle.
5221400	5222400	Why all don't you get it?
5222400	5223400	All right.
5223400	5225400	I'll just go from what we did tonight.
5225400	5226400	Yo, we played a little D&D.
5226400	5228400	There was a girl on stage.
5228400	5230400	Greg Proops was all the rage.
5230400	5233400	However, there was a little animosity.
5233400	5236400	Yeah, and some pomosity.
5236400	5238400	It's all good down in the thing.
5238400	5241400	We're on the nerd melt on Sunset BLD.
5241400	5242400	We're parking cars.
5242400	5245400	Ain't no way to know which way you're going to get a ticket anyway.
5245400	5249400	I can't think of any better way to end the podcast than three white guys
5249400	5251400	just rapping their ass off.
5251400	5253400	Yo, nerd melt in the house.
5253400	5255400	Everybody put those hands in the air.
5255400	5257400	And if you like Greg Proops, say yeah.
5257400	5259400	Yeah.
5259400	5260400	Say yeah.

5269400	5271400	Enough stuff, stuff.
5271400	5273400	He's going all night long.
5273400	5279400	He's going to get you with his massive wrong.
5279400	5281400	Dan Harmon, take it down.
5281400	5284400	Finish it off, Dan.
5285400	5287400	Come on.
