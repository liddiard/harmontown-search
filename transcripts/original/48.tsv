0	25760	8 o'clock already I was just in the middle of a dream
25760	30760	Harmontown is now in session, let me hear all my harmonians scream
30760	38760	Oh shit! It's Monday nights, we're at the Meltdown Theater in Hollywood, California.
38760	41760	Harmontown is once again in session, you lucky devils.
41760	47760	Won't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.
47760	58760	Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Davis, your Comptroller. Harmontown's Comptroller.
58760	66760	That's an interesting choice for opening music. We referenced it inadvertently last week, do you remember?
66760	76760	I don't. DC Pearson's episode, when he was a guest, I said, God damn it, I don't know, somebody, I told them I was lost in their eyes
76760	79760	and was kissing them by a crystal blue Italian stream.
79760	87760	I was driving here in my car and I had my whole iPod on shuffle and that came up and I was like, I've never started the show with Manic Monday.
87760	96760	Manic Monday. The podcast probably airs around Thursday, but for these people here tonight, it's another hopefully Manic Monday.
96760	100760	They need a little mania to keep them awake because tomorrow's Tuesday they got shit to do.
100760	106760	But you're shit out of luck because I just got over like a three or four day cold.
106760	111760	I don't know if you can hear my David Duchovny Willie Nelson congestion.
111760	120760	But yeah, I've been sitting in bed watching Gene Hackman movies for four days by a crystal blue Italian stream.
120760	122760	Only Gene Hackman?
122760	128760	Well, I went on a little Gene Hackman bender. I watched Night Moves. I'd never seen Night Moves.
128760	133760	It was nice. This is a scene where he's laying face down. This could only happen in the 70s.
133760	142760	It just cuts to Gene Hackman naked. Just finished boning his ex-wife and he's laying face down and there's a fondue pot in front of him.
142760	147760	And he's naked and he's got his foot on her tit.
147760	157760	Sorry, let me explain. She's sitting against the headboard like sitting up in bed and Gene Hackman is laying face down towards the camera.
157760	161760	There's fondue at the foot of the bed, so there's a pot in front of the camera.
161760	163760	That sounds like a real hazard.
163760	168760	If this was in 3D, the first thing in front of your face that you would reach out in touch would be a fondue pot.
168760	171760	The second thing would be Gene Hackman. The third thing would be his foot.
171760	174760	And the fourth thing right under that would be this woman's tit.
174760	178760	And he's just got a big smile on his face and he's solving a murder case.
178760	183760	Is it cheating?
183760	189760	My parents had a lot of sexy 70s, early 80s fondue parties. Was this hot oil and meat or was this cheese?
189760	192760	I was dying to know whether it was chocolate or cheese.
192760	193760	Chocolate or cheese?
193760	198760	The whole scene. You could tell that it was a situation where the actor just asked for some business.
198760	201760	I have a feeling the fondue pot was requested by the actor.
201760	202760	No.
202760	211760	And I have a feeling it was empty and I think he just sat there and played with something on a stick and then played with her tit with his foot.
211760	213760	You almost destroyed the vodka.
213760	217760	Yeah, yeah. It's another manic Monday. Whatever.
217760	223760	We got off to a slow start and we're going to have a slow middle and then we're going to end the show very slowly.
223760	225760	Well, maybe we should start off with a bang then.
225760	229760	Because I kind of can't. I have that congestion where you can't.
229760	233760	I don't even know if anyone can hear me. You know what I mean?
233760	237760	This sounds, this will make people angry.
237760	240760	Imagine what it's like to be deaf. No, probably not.
240760	243760	I don't think. But I mean as close as I can get.
243760	247760	You're kind of like talking out into nothingness.
247760	251760	That's good. They brought the lights up more to compensate for my lack of other senses.
251760	254760	I'm like Daredevil.
254760	258760	It should be the other way around. Your lack of hearing should heighten your vision right now.
258760	260760	Everything should be the other way around, Jeff.
260760	269760	Which is a segue into a favorite segment called Things Dan Harmon Has To Complain About That He's Afraid To Complain About Because It'll Make Him Sound Like A Bad Person.
270760	272760	Thank you.
281760	286760	I have 5,000 Facebook friends, which makes my calendar very unmanageable.
286760	288760	There's a lot of settings that I don't understand.
288760	291760	My Google calendar and my Facebook are somehow interwoven.
291760	295760	And I'm 40 and I'm not going to put the time into figuring it out anymore.
295760	298760	So I just have this calendar. I just go, do I have anything going on today?
298760	303760	And the answer is always yes. It'll just say, ah, Chip and Simmons dating hour.
303760	307760	Is it UCB? What? What is that?
307760	310760	Oh, it's Maggie Molina's birthday. What?
310760	314760	I don't... That's my complaint. 5,000.
318760	320760	There's got to be some...
320760	323760	I'm trying to punctuate this as best I can, man.
323760	326760	I'm trying to show biz up this bit a little bit.
327760	329760	There's got to be some check box.
329760	333760	There's got to be some check book. I can make a check out to Facebook.
333760	336760	There's got to be a check box somewhere where it says, yeah, sure.
336760	341760	Every time someone has an improv show that is on my Facebook thing,
341760	343760	I don't want that on my Google calendar.
343760	347760	I just feel so fucking old. And I'm not complaining about that.
347760	350760	It's just amazing. I've said this before.
350760	357760	I remember my grandpa before, after he killed the Japanese for our country,
357760	360760	and after he drove a truck, and after he blew up in an oil tank,
360760	365760	and after he did a million amazing things, right before he died of emphysema,
365760	370760	he was the treasurer for his Freemason club.
370760	374760	And he had a little Mac, a little tiny Mac,
374760	379760	and he was just using his little skin-grafted hand to learn, quicken.
379760	382760	And he would get so frustrated with the goddamn fucking computer.
382760	387760	Goddammit, Danny, can you tell me how the goddamn spreadsheet works?
387760	390760	And I would go, I'm not sure. Well, go up to think.
390760	392760	But I remember thinking to my head, like, oh, grandpa, come on,
392760	397760	don't try to use a computer. And I'm not that much, like,
397760	401760	technology's moving faster now. So I'm pretty much,
401760	404760	I think I'm exactly where my grandpa was right before he died,
404760	408760	in terms of, like, understanding goddamn computers.
408760	410760	It's not exciting to talk about.
410760	412760	Was that one of them? No, no.
412760	414760	That's something I'm allowed to complain about,
414760	418760	because it'll make people think I'm boring. Sorry.
418760	421760	All right, there's only one more item in this segment.
421760	426760	The professional puppy that I'm breeding,
426760	428760	they're a professional puppy breeder.
428760	431760	You're breeding a professional puppy?
431760	437760	It's going to pull down 20K a year, just licking its balls.
437760	440760	What line of work is this puppy going to go into?
440760	441760	Hanging out.
441760	443760	We went through a breeder.
443760	445760	This is why I'm not allowed to complain about it,
445760	447760	because you're supposed to rescue your pets,
447760	448760	and I don't want to talk about it.
448760	452760	But it's for my cat, my AIDS-having cat, that is a rescue cat.
452760	456760	Just because your cat has AIDS doesn't make you buying a purebred dog,
456760	458760	you know, any cooler.
458760	461760	No, it doesn't make it cooler, but it makes it permissible,
461760	463760	because I can't bring a three-legged, one-eyed,
463760	468760	fucked-up Ukrainian dog into the house with my AIDS cat hanging out,
468760	472760	whose immune system, which is linked to stress and territory,
472760	474760	cats are territorial.
474760	476760	I don't know how much longer she has to live.
476760	479760	I know it's her house. It's her rules.
479760	481760	I love her. She was there first.
481760	482760	She's a rescue cat.
482760	484760	I'm not going to bring some maniac into the house.
484760	485760	Dogs are all maniacs.
485760	489760	Well, not little pity puppies that come in a little pity puppy box.
489760	492760	Puppies don't come in a box, Stan.
492760	496760	If she's there when the box is open, she can swat it on the head
496760	497760	and assert dominance.
497760	500760	It's the safest route to go, okay?
500760	503760	And I'm not going to go to one of those weird Koreatown puppy stores
503760	508760	where the puppies are in the fish tank or whatever.
508760	514760	I went through a respectable breeder who's breeding a healthy hybrid.
514760	516760	When is his dog going to come in?
516760	517760	When does the box arrive?
517760	520760	A couple months now. There's different stages.
520760	521760	They were just born.
521760	524760	The mother just gave birth to 13 puppies.
524760	526760	13 puppy litter.
526760	529760	That's bad luck, you know.
529760	532760	Bad luck for the 13th puppy, yeah.
532760	535760	Because there's only 12 nipples.
535760	538760	Look it up.
538760	543760	It's probably like six.
543760	547760	But the dog nipples are dichotomous.
547760	549760	They have two openings on them.
549760	551760	So for a maximum of 12 dogs.
551760	557760	That's also not true either.
557760	558760	She gave birth.
558760	560760	I'm assuming they would tell us in the email.
560760	562760	They sent us ultrasounds.
562760	567760	Like we could see little dog skeletons in the larger dog skeleton.
567760	569760	And then I'm assuming they would tell us.
569760	572760	A lot of times, especially with a larger litter,
572760	575760	there's some tragedies, you know, with cats and dogs.
575760	576760	There's a stillborn.
576760	578760	Yeah, I'm assuming they would tell us.
578760	582760	So 13 newborn puppies without a single tragedy is really,
582760	583760	that's a lucky dog.
583760	584760	And what sort of dog are you getting?
584760	587760	It's a half golden retriever half poodle.
587760	589760	And what do you call it?
589760	600760	A retriever maximus golden doodle.
600760	603760	You don't have to call it that.
603760	605760	Have you got a name for it?
605760	606760	No, no.
606760	608760	We're going to let that happen organically.
608760	614760	As organic as ordering a dog, huh?
614760	617760	Are you getting lots of shit from people for not rescuing a dog?
617760	618760	No, no.
618760	619760	Just a couple people initially.
619760	622760	But now I've learned to walk around with a giant asterisk
622760	625760	and cut everyone off at the pass and be a big, you know,
625760	627760	four people.
627760	630760	Before you say anything.
630760	632760	My cat has AIDS.
632760	634760	Yeah, exactly.
635760	638760	By the way, my cat, I don't know if, my cat has no name.
638760	642760	My cat's name is Vivian, F-I-V, because when we rescued my cat,
642760	645760	we were told, the vet said, it has F-I-V.
645760	646760	What's that?
646760	647760	It's like HIV, but for cats.
647760	650760	Oh, shit, we rescued a cat that's like,
650760	655760	we're going to just spend the last act of a Julia Roberts movie with this thing.
655760	656760	Let's not name it.
656760	661760	Like, let's just love it and let it live its wildlife, you know,
661760	664760	and we'll feed it and we'll let it kind of shuffle off to Buffalo.
664760	669760	And Buffalo is where I believe you go when you die.
669760	671760	That's where you get your wings.
671760	673760	And so it's like 13 years later or something,
673760	679760	and the cat's name is Viv, F-I-V.
679760	680760	It happens.
680760	682760	It never happens with human beings, but it happens.
682760	686760	Speaking of death, let's keep the theme of death going.
686760	689760	I want to bring up a special friend who comes here very often
689760	693760	and is very interesting, and we should have often talked to him.
693760	697760	And I just, shit, we got a lot of people that fit that category.
697760	700760	I just realized I perked up like six people.
700760	703760	I want to bring up Brian W. Collins.
703760	704760	Is he here?
704760	705760	Brian, are you here?
705760	706760	No.
706760	707760	Okay, that's good, actually.
707760	708760	Okay, you know why?
708760	710760	Because we have a replacement for him.
710760	711760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
711760	712760	How about Doug Benson, everybody?
712760	713760	Welcome, Doug Benson.
713760	714760	Sure, yeah.
714760	715760	Hey, everybody.
715760	717760	What were you going to talk to him about?
717760	728760	I'll just talk about that with you.
728760	734760	Can you pretend you just ended your blog where you watch a horror movie a day?
734760	737760	Oh, it was tough to get through, but I did it, Dan.
737760	740760	And I'm happy to be here and talk about it.
740760	744760	But you actually, that's not even that ironic, because you do Doug Love's movies.
744760	745760	I do love movies, yeah.
745760	746760	You're a guy who can talk to you about movies.
746760	747760	Sure.
747760	749760	I just saw Wreck It Ralph, have you seen that?
749760	750760	Yeah.
750760	751760	Did you?
751760	757760	You guys heard of this thing?
757760	758760	Yeah, I love it.
758760	759760	I love it.
759760	766760	I saw it last November when it came out, and I really ate it up.
767760	770760	My podcast is called Dan Likes Movies, kind of.
770760	772760	Dan gets around to movies.
772760	773760	It catches up with them eventually.
773760	775760	Dan likes some of his screeners.
775760	778760	Dan has Netflix.
778760	781760	Dan gets sick every once a year.
781760	782760	It got me, man.
782760	783760	I was bawling like a maniac.
783760	787760	Oh, you watched it during the, you took a break from Gene Hackman to watch Wreck It Ralph?
787760	789760	I just watched it today with my girlfriend, yeah.
789760	790760	It killed me.
790760	791760	God, it got me good.
791760	795760	What do you think Gene Hackman looks like, just not to change the subject on you?
795760	799760	What do you think he looks like right now?
799760	804760	When was Welcome to Mooseport, which should not be his last movie, first of all?
804760	806760	That was Ray Romano, right?
806760	807760	Yeah.
807760	808760	I didn't see that.
808760	809760	I didn't see him in the trailer, so I don't even have that.
809760	813760	He did Tenenbaums, which is not only a great movie, but his performance is amazing.
813760	817760	And then Welcome to Mooseport was his swan song.
817760	820760	Do you think he's on hard health or something?
820760	824760	I just think he, well, to completely stop acting,
824760	827760	he doesn't even do voiceovers for Lowe's or whatever it was he was doing.
827760	828760	Oh, yeah.
828760	832760	So I think he's like, remember when Henry Fonda showed up in On Golden Pond,
832760	834760	and he was like, holy fuck, what happened to him?
834760	837760	Because he didn't do a movie for 10 years, and then he showed up crazy old.
837760	839760	When's Gene Hackman going to do that?
839760	840760	Yeah.
840760	841760	Is my question.
841760	843760	Well, it seems like he's been doing that since the 70s.
843760	846760	I mean, he started like the Betty White of men.
846760	851760	Like, in the 70s, which was cool, like I was showing my girlfriend,
851760	856760	we went on this kick of like, let's watch 70s movies because she's 29, 28.
856760	858760	Aaron, what did you just turn?
858760	859760	28.
859760	862760	Hi, Aaron.
862760	863760	I thought you said bye, Aaron.
863760	864760	Yeah.
864760	865760	See ya.
865760	866760	What color are your eyes?
866760	871760	Get out of here, young'un.
871760	874760	I was explaining to her like, man, look at Donald Sutherland.
874760	875760	Look at him.
875760	876760	Look at Donald Sutherland.
876760	877760	He was a leading man.
877760	878760	He was a sex symbol in the 70s.
878760	881760	That's how few people on the planet there were.
881760	882760	It was just an amazing time.
882760	883760	Me and Elliot Gould.
883760	884760	Yeah.
884760	886760	We were the top two movie stars.
886760	887760	And who else?
887760	888760	Alan Arkin.
888760	889760	Yeah, goddamn it.
889760	892760	Well, there was somebody who was in a Raymond Chandler thing.
892760	893760	Was it Elliot Gould?
893760	894760	Yeah, I think it was Elliot Gould.
894760	895760	It was like The Long Goodnight or something.
895760	896760	Yeah, yeah.
896760	897760	Goddamn it, Long Goodbye.
897760	898760	Long Goodbye.
898760	899760	It was the long something.
899760	900760	And there was...
900760	902760	God, it was like guys like your dad.
902760	905760	There was like guys with beards and checkered shirts.
905760	908760	And I longed for those days.
908760	911760	Well, you're bringing it back.
911760	913760	I'd like to go back to the...
913760	915760	Make a brief stop in the 80s and be a rap sensation
915760	919760	by rhyming me with free and saying,
919760	923760	ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, for the rest of the lyrics.
923760	926760	But then straight back to the 70s where I would be a sex symbol.
926760	928760	Just for a little bit, like a horror movie,
928760	930760	I'd be like that lumberjack that came by and was like,
930760	931760	what's going on?
931760	932760	What's the problem?
932760	934760	The Mercury Poisoning is making bears bigger.
934760	937760	I'll check it out.
937760	940760	But first I'm going to fuck her and her.
940760	943760	Then I'm going to wrestle that bear.
943760	945760	So I watched one horror movie a day?
945760	946760	Is that what I did?
946760	947760	Yeah, yeah, you did.
947760	948760	And then I wrote a blog about it?
948760	949760	Your name's Brian W. Collins.
949760	951760	I think your blog is probably called horrormovieaday.com,
951760	952760	I'm going to assume.
952760	953760	Does anyone know that that's true?
953760	954760	Yeah.
954760	955760	Okay.
955760	956760	Is that Brian Collins?
956760	958760	That's Brian Collins' lawyer.
958760	960760	And does he love all of them?
960760	961760	Or is he critical of them?
961760	962760	How does it work?
962760	965760	It's safe to say he's a huge fan of the genre in general
965760	967760	to the point where he's willing to tolerate warts and all,
967760	969760	you know, that he recognizes good ones and bad ones.
969760	971760	There's a lot of warts in that genre.
971760	972760	Doug, what is your movie schedule?
972760	975760	Like, how do you intake that many movies?
975760	977760	Are you always in the theaters?
977760	981760	No, I just have them implanted in my brain.
981760	984760	Yeah, right now I'm watching Brave.
984760	988760	Oh, I cried finally getting around to that.
988760	993760	When the bear eats the salmon, fuck it, it got me.
993760	994760	It was a goodie.
994760	995760	There's a scene in a restaurant?
995760	996760	No.
996760	999760	Where a bear orders sushi?
999760	1001760	The mom in Brave turns into a bear
1001760	1003760	and then she has to learn how to eat salmon,
1003760	1004760	but she's not a bear.
1004760	1005760	She's a woman, she's a queen.
1005760	1008760	And then the daughter has to teach her how to fish.
1008760	1010760	I cried, I'm an idiot.
1010760	1013760	That movie was not sold as a movie about bears.
1013760	1014760	Yeah.
1014760	1017760	It was supposed to be about a young girl who's good at archery.
1017760	1018760	Yeah.
1018760	1019760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1019760	1022760	I liked it though because it was only about women.
1022760	1026760	There was no damsel in distress, no knight in shining armor bullshit.
1026760	1029760	It was really just about like female characters.
1029760	1031760	A guy didn't come in and save the day for once.
1031760	1032760	I kind of like that.
1032760	1033760	Yeah, thank you.
1033760	1038760	And she didn't shave off all of her hair like Felicity.
1038760	1041760	She kept that beautiful mane.
1041760	1046760	Did Felicity do that to make a point that I'm bigger than my hair,
1046760	1047760	or?
1047760	1051760	Yeah, I think the idea was it was such a big move for Felicity to shave it off
1051760	1053760	and then the ratings dropped.
1053760	1054760	Yeah.
1054760	1055760	It was like, oh shit.
1055760	1056760	I mean, you think about her and you think about her hair.
1056760	1057760	It's true.
1057760	1058760	Yeah.
1058760	1059760	That hair was important.
1059760	1061760	But she doesn't have that hair on the Americans.
1061760	1062760	Have you seen the Americans?
1062760	1063760	No, no.
1063760	1068760	It's that FX show where she's like a Soviet spy pretending to be American.
1068760	1069760	And she has short hair?
1069760	1072760	Not short hair, but she doesn't have the curls.
1072760	1073760	Okay.
1073760	1074760	You know, she has Russian hair.
1074760	1076760	And her name's not Felicity, right?
1076760	1077760	On that show.
1077760	1078760	So she eliminated everything.
1078760	1080760	She got the whack-a-mole game right.
1080760	1082760	She knows that she's a good person.
1082760	1084760	She did it.
1084760	1085760	Whack-a-mole?
1085760	1086760	Yeah.
1086760	1092760	Like, I'm assuming that she eliminates her hair.
1092760	1093760	She's like, God damn it.
1093760	1094760	It's just my hair.
1094760	1098760	Like, she's in the shopping aisle and she sees Us Magazine and it says like,
1098760	1099760	best hair ever?
1099760	1100760	Felicity?
1100760	1101760	And she's like, fuck this.
1101760	1102760	I'm cutting off my hair.
1102760	1103760	And then she cuts it off.
1103760	1108760	And they're like, hey, good job acting.
1108760	1109760	Where'd your hair go?
1109760	1111760	And then she like gets a different job.
1111760	1113760	But maybe the character's name is Felicity.
1113760	1116760	I was thinking maybe it was hard for her to nail down all the variables that
1116760	1119760	she's in a quest to figure out that she's a good person.
1119760	1120760	All right.
1120760	1121760	I guess I can't back that up.
1121760	1123760	All right.
1123760	1124760	I like it.
1124760	1126760	And back to Wreck-it Ralph.
1126760	1127760	Yeah.
1127760	1128760	Good movie.
1128760	1129760	You enjoyed it?
1129760	1130760	I did.
1130760	1134760	And I find it not only touching in that kind of cloying way that most of
1134760	1136760	those movies you can kind of count on being touched now.
1136760	1137760	Sure.
1137760	1139760	Like sort of like being Catholic.
1139760	1142760	Hello.
1142760	1147760	That's in the way that you use it.
1147760	1150760	You can kind of, I mean, to the point where they can actually make you well up
1150760	1152760	and you're kind of like, now we take that for granted.
1152760	1154760	I'm going to Pixar tier coming down.
1154760	1157760	It's just, you know, that guy has like such good animation.
1157760	1159760	I can tell how alone he is.
1159760	1162760	But it's like it's another thing to have that.
1162760	1164760	And then also like it's kind of profound.
1164760	1167760	Like I thought like there's I don't know.
1167760	1171760	It's sort of feel there's a there's a social subversiveness to it.
1171760	1172760	Like all that filtered through.
1172760	1173760	It's a movie for kids.
1173760	1175760	But I was watching it going like this.
1175760	1179760	I can't really nail them down on any bad messaging for anybody in particular.
1179760	1181760	They really had to thread a needle because there's a, you know,
1181760	1184760	there's a character in the movie that's like congenitally afflicted.
1184760	1186760	And there and it's like, oh, you're special.
1186760	1187760	You're not special.
1187760	1190760	How are they going to land this?
1190760	1193760	Are they going to is the moral going to be that she needs to not be afflicted
1193760	1196760	or is the moral going to be that her affliction is a gift?
1196760	1198760	Like because it's hard to get through those highway cones these days.
1198760	1200760	And I thought they got through them as well as you possibly could.
1200760	1202760	What was the moral eventually? I forgot.
1202760	1206760	It was it was like other evil people in the world that made you afflicted.
1206760	1209760	But your affliction is a matter of perception.
1209760	1213760	So as soon as you just participate with your affliction,
1213760	1215760	you stop being afflicted.
1215760	1216760	So it's really just a matter of.
1216760	1218760	Kind of like thalidomide babies.
1218760	1221760	Yeah. Just if you're if you're a thalidomide baby,
1221760	1223760	host a talk show. That's the message.
1223760	1225760	Like get out there.
1225760	1227760	Get out there on a dancing show.
1227760	1228760	Just do it. Yeah.
1228760	1230760	Just get out there. Get in their face.
1230760	1234760	Dancing with thalidomide stars.
1234760	1235760	Yeah. And then people.
1235760	1239760	I love the groans like his thalidomide baby is even a thing anymore.
1239760	1240760	To be upset about.
1240760	1245760	It's like it's like people being upset for Dracula.
1246760	1249760	Captain's hat is confused.
1249760	1251760	That's our friend Adam Goldberg.
1251760	1256760	Adam Goldberg has affected a skipper hat.
1256760	1259760	We'll see you on the Lido deck after the show.
1259760	1263760	Adam Goldberg is retired from being a Harman John character by his own account.
1263760	1268760	He's now going to sit in the audience and slowly become Captain Crunch.
1268760	1272760	He's going to put more epaulettes and metals on.
1272760	1275760	He's going to have a parrot in his shoulder going, not in the show.
1275760	1281760	And he's going to tear up the roof of our mouths.
1281760	1284760	As Captain Crunch is known to do.
1284760	1286760	He's supposed to put milk in there, Doug.
1286760	1288760	He's supposed to put milk in there.
1288760	1289760	Even with the milk, there's something in there.
1289760	1292760	You've got to get them so soggy before they'll tear up your mouth.
1292760	1293760	And something in there that's slow.
1293760	1296760	I think it's just like peeling. It's like a chemical peel.
1296760	1297760	Milk or not.
1297760	1301760	Yeah. That's why I'll have the crunch berries because they're a goddamn relief.
1301760	1303760	Next to the crunch itself.
1303760	1304760	They had a cereal cup.
1304760	1307760	For a brief period, they had ET cereal.
1307760	1309760	And it was because there were Reese's Pieces in the movie
1309760	1313760	that was peanut butter chocolate cereal in the shapes of little E's and T's
1313760	1317760	because I assume that they couldn't make them the shape of a bike or something.
1317760	1319760	And it was so fucking good.
1319760	1321760	And then it was like gone off the shelves immediately.
1321760	1323760	And I know it wasn't because they weren't delicious.
1323760	1324760	And I know it wasn't because they weren't selling.
1324760	1327760	So it must be because they gave me cancer.
1328760	1331760	I'm waiting to find out that ET cereal gave me cancer.
1331760	1333760	Oris Bielberg came down on it for some reason.
1333760	1335760	You think they tried to do it on the slide?
1335760	1336760	Yeah.
1337760	1338760	Nice try.
1339760	1342760	ET and it says under it, extra tasty.
1346760	1348760	Vitamin E and firemen.
1349760	1352760	Phone a bowl of delicious...
1353760	1356760	And it's just like they got a kid on the box
1356760	1358760	that's like a burn victim that's like...
1361760	1362760	You're right.
1362760	1363760	Burn victims are funny.
1363760	1364760	What am I, baby?
1364760	1366760	Burn victim, yes.
1366760	1367760	We're going to find...
1367760	1369760	We're whack-a-mole in the audience.
1369760	1370760	Whack-a-mole?
1370760	1371760	Whack-a-mole?
1371760	1372760	What the fuck?
1372760	1373760	I'm calling you out.
1374760	1375760	Sorry, sorry.
1375760	1376760	Have you tried Lincoln-O's?
1376760	1377760	Those are pretty good.
1377760	1378760	Lincoln-O's?
1378760	1379760	Lincoln-O's?
1379760	1380760	Yeah, it's a new cereal.
1380760	1381760	Yeah.
1381760	1383760	Yeah, it tastes like...
1383760	1384760	Freedom?
1384760	1385760	Freedom.
1385760	1387760	And raspberry.
1387760	1390760	Wait, is this a real thing or is this like a hustler cartoon?
1391760	1393760	Is it a real thing?
1396760	1398760	Lincoln-O's.
1400760	1404760	Well, Lincoln Logs, I guess, would be a good breakfast drink.
1404760	1406760	You guys remember Hogan's Heroes, right?
1406760	1408760	This world has insane things in it.
1408760	1409760	It does.
1409760	1410760	It does have the craziest things.
1410760	1412760	It's a sitcom about a concentration camp.
1412760	1413760	That's the best.
1415760	1418760	All right, well, that was based off of the Billy Wilder film, right?
1418760	1420760	Stalag 17, was it?
1420760	1421760	What was?
1421760	1422760	Hogan's Heroes.
1422760	1424760	Wasn't it kind of based on the success of that film?
1424760	1429760	Yeah, it's like, let's take the funny parts of that movie about the guys in a concentration camp...
1429760	1430760	Right.
1430760	1432760	...and then make it a weekly series.
1432760	1433760	Exactly.
1433760	1434760	Where the Germans are dumb.
1434760	1437760	I remember, like, you know, I was pretty young when I first started watching Mash.
1438760	1441760	The Korean War was really ugly, and it's a hospital.
1441760	1443760	That must have been a good pitch.
1443760	1444760	It's such a weird thing.
1444760	1447760	And then you watch the Mash movie, and it's like a Robert Altman film,
1447760	1451760	and it's like this weird meandering thing about the playing war.
1451760	1453760	Yeah, doesn't it end pretty much with a football game?
1453760	1454760	Yeah.
1454760	1458760	It ends the way a lot of ski movies end in the 80s.
1458760	1462760	But you assume, because it's Robert Altman and the Korean War, that that means something.
1462760	1463760	You go, like, all right, fuck it up.
1463760	1464760	Look for someone else, then.
1464760	1465760	What happened to ski movies?
1465760	1467760	Ski movies were a thing for a while.
1467760	1468760	We accomplished it.
1468760	1469760	Adam Goldberg?
1469760	1472760	I was about to make a ski movie last week, so...
1472760	1473760	Shut up.
1473760	1474760	We're fine.
1474760	1477760	You were about to make one, but you had the wrong hat on.
1479760	1481760	You were like, I'll get a ski hat, and we'll talk.
1482760	1484760	You were about to make a ski movie?
1484760	1485760	Yeah, for sci-fi.
1485760	1486760	For real?
1486760	1487760	Yeah, I told you about it.
1487760	1488760	I wasn't listening.
1491760	1494760	Did the listeners love it when he talks a lot off mic like that?
1494760	1495760	Well, not off mic.
1495760	1497760	Some of them like it when he talks on mic.
1497760	1498760	Some of them don't.
1498760	1499760	It's like a whole thing.
1499760	1500760	But can they hear him when he was just saying it?
1500760	1501760	No, they can't hear him, really.
1501760	1503760	And you don't bother to repeat it?
1503760	1504760	Sometimes we do.
1504760	1505760	I mean, you're an old pro.
1505760	1508760	He's like, eh, don't worry about it.
1508760	1510760	Sometimes the mics pick it up.
1510760	1511760	I don't know.
1511760	1512760	I kind of like, I let God decide.
1512760	1514760	You were God.
1514760	1515760	That's a smart problem.
1515760	1516760	I am, I am God.
1516760	1517760	He's the guy with Parmesan.
1517760	1518760	I let me decide.
1518760	1520760	So it depends on how much I've been drinking.
1520760	1521760	Doug, I'm sorry.
1521760	1526760	I'm not audio running my show like a steel trap.
1526760	1528760	Hey, it was just a question.
1528760	1531760	I know you have a lot of moles to whack.
1531760	1533760	He's a mixed bag.
1533760	1536760	If you open this box, here, watch.
1536760	1538760	Is that what his profile says on Twitter?
1538760	1539760	Mixed bag.
1539760	1541760	Oh, here we go.
1541760	1545760	A microphone is dangerously being extended towards Adam right now.
1545760	1549760	Oh, he's pulling it out of the stand because he likes to hold on to it.
1549760	1550760	He's a pro.
1550760	1551760	Yep.
1551760	1553760	Oh, now what's supposed to happen?
1553760	1554760	Nobody knows.
1554760	1559760	Now the host of the show has no microphone.
1559760	1561760	It's the danger zone.
1561760	1570760	No, last week I was hired on to production manage a ski movie called Avalanche Sharks.
1570760	1572760	Swear hand to the Lord.
1572760	1577760	And it was renamed Avalanche Shark, then Avalanche Sharks because they couldn't determine how
1577760	1581760	many puppet sharks should be furnished for the script.
1581760	1583760	This was a huge source of contention.
1583760	1589760	So they're still making ski movies, but they keep killing all the actors with puppets.
1589760	1593760	So this is a movie about people skiing and then there's an avalanche, but inside the
1593760	1594760	avalanche there are sharks.
1594760	1596760	Or the avalanche was caused by sharks.
1596760	1602760	I couldn't get through all the way through the script I was supposed to be working on.
1602760	1604760	Yeah, that's about it.
1604760	1608760	All right, now he's going to get the microphone back.
1608760	1610760	Microphone is going back in the stand.
1610760	1611760	Good call, Dan.
1611760	1612760	There you go.
1612760	1613760	Adam Goldberg, everyone.
1613760	1614760	Thank you, Adam.
1614760	1615760	Worth a try.
1615760	1616760	Worth a try.
1616760	1618760	Let's just bring up an interesting point.
1618760	1623760	As a fan of movies and probably a fan of crappy movies and talking about them, what's your
1623760	1630760	take on the kind of the sci-fi original movement of like Manskeeto and Gator Bader and, you
1631760	1636760	know, human dental floss and like things that you're like, 10, 15 years ago, if you saw
1636760	1639760	these titles, you'd go, holy shit.
1639760	1644760	You seem like you might be around my age, like the greatest thing used to be to get
1644760	1649760	high and go to the actual video store and walk up and down aisles and look at pictures
1649760	1656760	and read backs of boxes and go to like sci-fi kickboxing sections and go like, holy shit,
1656760	1658760	these people are trying as hard as they can to make a good movie.
1658760	1659760	This is their Citizen Kane.
1659760	1661760	Let's watch the result.
1661760	1666760	And now in this post Piranha 3D, post like Manskeeto world, it's like, it's like, no,
1666760	1667760	it's supposed to be funny.
1667760	1672760	Octo Hirana, Teradonna, Piranha Shark Gator.
1672760	1673760	It's hilarious.
1673760	1674760	Debbie Gibson's in it.
1674760	1675760	It's funny.
1675760	1678760	And I'm kind of like, ah, fuck you if you think it's funny.
1678760	1679760	Fuck you.
1679760	1680760	Try hard so I can laugh at you.
1680760	1684760	Without video stores, where do we go now?
1684760	1687760	I don't have one, but where do you go to argue with your girlfriend?
1687760	1692760	To really find out how many years the relationship is going to last.
1692760	1695760	It's like, you really want me to walk down this aisle?
1695760	1700760	The Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan aisle before the actual aisle?
1700760	1702760	Dan, can we hear your pitch on human dental floss?
1702760	1708760	It's a guy who works for the American Medical Association and then he stops by the American
1708760	1714760	Dental Association to tell them that they should be working together because dentists
1714760	1716760	aren't paying attention to medicine.
1716760	1717760	They're focused on the teeth.
1717760	1719760	And he's a doctor.
1719760	1721760	And so he's like, what are you guys doing here?
1721760	1724760	And they're like, pretty soon the whole world's going to be teeth, right?
1724760	1729760	And then we've got a virtual chamber to show you that.
1729760	1730760	And it's like a tooth chamber.
1730760	1731760	And he gets locked in it.
1731760	1736760	And then they maximize the calcium rays and he ends up between the teeth.
1736760	1741760	But because of his medical knowledge, he's able to keep himself alive as his body is
1741760	1742760	compressed by the teeth.
1742760	1746760	So he becomes effectively human dental floss by page 20.
1746760	1749760	And then he goes out in the streets and he finds that he's able.
1749760	1753760	There's a lot of heavy-handed metaphors about cleaning the streets.
1753760	1756760	You know, this place is needed.
1756760	1758760	You know, a lot of it's got gum disease.
1758760	1761760	It's gutters are bleeding.
1761760	1763760	It's a sign that it needs to brush harder.
1763760	1764760	It's dumb.
1764760	1765760	It's a dumb movie.
1765760	1769760	It has Richard Marx is in it.
1769760	1771760	It's purposely campy.
1771760	1772760	It's stupid.
1772760	1773760	It's one of those.
1773760	1777760	Yeah, it's a $1 million sci-fi original.
1777760	1781760	And it's like, oh, I'm supposed to show up to watch you fuck around?
1781760	1785760	I wanted to fuck around with my friends and some cheesy popcorn.
1785760	1789760	Yeah, I'm not into that they're making movies that are shit intentionally.
1789760	1793760	They're just shoving things together and calling it a movie.
1793760	1795760	I don't seek that out.
1795760	1800760	There's plenty of movies that try to be great and are awful that I like to watch.
1800760	1804760	That's why we have the Olympics and we don't have like shitty Olympics.
1804760	1808760	It's called Special Olympics, but close enough.
1808760	1810760	But those people try even harder.
1810760	1811760	They should have brought you by.
1811760	1814760	It's a little mine.
1814760	1818760	The Special Olympians try as hard as real Olympians.
1818760	1820760	They're just special when they're trying.
1820760	1821760	Again, that's the whole point.
1821760	1825760	They probably try harder and then don't murder their girlfriend through a bathroom door.
1825760	1828760	That's a reference I will pretend to get.
1828760	1831760	Because I'm sure it must be a shame that I don't get that.
1831760	1834760	There was a guy, Oscar Pistorius.
1834760	1836760	Pistorius.
1836760	1838760	Oh, he doesn't sound evil.
1838760	1841760	You really don't know the story of Oscar Pistorius?
1841760	1843760	Dr. Pistorius?
1843760	1844760	From beyond?
1844760	1846760	Pretend this is not real.
1846760	1849760	Pretend that this is an idea I'm pitching to you to make a movie.
1849760	1850760	Okay, I work at Sci-Fi.
1850760	1854760	There is a guy that ran in the regular Olympics, the last Olympics,
1854760	1857760	and he's missing both legs below the knee.
1857760	1858760	What?
1858760	1859760	And they call him the Blade Runner.
1859760	1860760	The Blade Runner?
1860760	1861760	Because he has two behind his back?
1861760	1862760	No, no.
1862760	1863760	Two his face.
1863760	1864760	Two his face.
1864760	1866760	They're like, you're a replicant.
1866760	1871760	He has two metal hooky things that he runs on.
1871760	1872760	And he runs like...
1872760	1873760	They look like springs.
1873760	1874760	I thought it was cheating.
1874760	1875760	Yeah.
1875760	1877760	Do they know Blade Runners aren't replicants?
1877760	1879760	Or might be, depending on which cut of the movie.
1879760	1882760	I don't think...
1882760	1883760	I want to know how much...
1883760	1885760	Are they calling him a robot or are they calling him like...
1885760	1886760	They're saying he's a runner and he's like...
1886760	1888760	They're saying he's a runner and there's two metal things on his face.
1888760	1889760	They're like blades.
1889760	1891760	Yeah, they're like springy, weird blade things.
1891760	1893760	And he was a big hero in the Olympics.
1893760	1894760	It was a big thing.
1894760	1897760	And now he recently is under a murder investigation
1897760	1900760	for shooting his girlfriend to pieces in the bathroom.
1900760	1901760	Jesus.
1901760	1902760	Shot her through the bathroom door.
1902760	1905760	His story is that he heard noise in the bathroom,
1905760	1907760	thought it was a burglar, because a lot of burglars...
1907760	1909760	First thing they'll do is take a dump.
1909760	1915760	And he didn't bother to look to see if his girlfriend was in bed with him.
1915760	1916760	That's the guy.
1916760	1919760	Someone just handed Dan a phone with a picture on it.
1919760	1920760	And he...
1920760	1923760	So he shot through the bathroom door because he thought it was a burglar.
1923760	1924760	Do you know what?
1924760	1925760	Okay.
1925760	1928760	Am I racist because I assumed he was black because...
1928760	1929760	Yes.
1929760	1930760	Yes.
1930760	1932760	Yes, you are.
1932760	1934760	Because what?
1934760	1937760	But not because of the murder, because of the...
1937760	1940760	Because of the Olympian prowess, because of the...
1940760	1941760	Still racist.
1941760	1943760	Even like those black dudes.
1943760	1945760	I know it's still racist.
1945760	1946760	Better athletes than you.
1946760	1947760	But it's like...
1947760	1950760	It was reasonable racism.
1950760	1953760	You said he was like an amazing runner.
1953760	1955760	And he's from South Africa, but that's a Dutch colony.
1955760	1957760	So, you know, it was a toss-up.
1957760	1958760	I didn't hear South Africa.
1958760	1959760	That's not...
1959760	1960760	I immediately was just like...
1960760	1963760	I just pictured a fucking amazing runner with robot legs,
1963760	1965760	and I pictured an awesome black guy.
1965760	1968760	Now, tell me, because it has to, in some way, some minute way,
1968760	1972760	or maybe some grand way, affect your new perception of this guy.
1973760	1976760	I hate him more because I was raised in the 70s.
1976760	1978760	I thought if he was black, I was like,
1978760	1980760	well, maybe, what did this woman do to him?
1983760	1986760	Turns out she was just beautiful and trying to take a shit.
1988760	1990760	Hey, I know you got lots more things going on tonight.
1990760	1993760	I'm going to take off, but thank you so much for having me.
1993760	1995760	Thank you, Doug Benson.
2003760	2006760	Doug Benson read the writing on the wall when he got out on stage.
2006760	2009760	He's like, if I'm going to get out of here in an orderly fashion,
2009760	2012760	it's going to be because of professional schedules, this thing.
2012760	2013760	That was very pro.
2013760	2015760	He got a laugh and just boned out.
2017760	2018760	All right.
2018760	2019760	To his point...
2019760	2021760	Wait, should we talk about the Blade Runner?
2021760	2022760	No, everyone's talking about him.
2022760	2024760	Also, I'm kind of proud of the fact that
2024760	2029760	because of my pop-cultural deafness,
2029760	2031760	I'm not plugged in at all anymore.
2032760	2037760	We never talked about that fucking crazy supervillain,
2037760	2041760	that cop that went nuts and was shooting other cops
2041760	2044760	and then they burnt him to death in a cabin and blah, blah, blah.
2044760	2046760	I just wanted to bring up the fact that we never talked about it.
2046760	2049760	Also, I feel like it got a lot of media coverage,
2049760	2051760	but then it was just kind of gone, it seemed like.
2051760	2055760	I think it was so much malfeasance and shit that went down.
2055760	2058760	LAPD just shoot up a bunch of innocent fuckers.
2058760	2063760	A bad cop got chased by other bad cops and everybody else died.
2063760	2067760	Yeah, that was just a rug getting like,
2067760	2069760	like out in the middle of the room.
2069760	2071760	I don't think I've told it in harm intended.
2071760	2073760	I won't make it a long story if possible,
2073760	2077760	but I went to USC and I was walking down the road with my friend Matt Gorley,
2077760	2079760	just Super Ego podcast and stuff.
2079760	2083760	We're walking up the road and we've been playing with pellet guns.
2083760	2086760	We actually had guns on us earlier, like little replica Berettas.
2086760	2089760	We just shot little plastic balls before Airsoft.
2089760	2092760	We're walking up Figaro Boulevard, downtown, south central,
2092760	2094760	and with another friend of ours, Kenny,
2094760	2096760	and a car goes by us and backfires.
2096760	2098760	That doesn't really happen anymore.
2098760	2100760	You don't hear the old timey bang.
2100760	2102760	Admissions, bro.
2102760	2104760	You've got to get that shit checked out.
2104760	2105760	Absolutely.
2105760	2107760	Well, you don't see a lot of dog shit.
2107760	2110760	Our friend Kenny heard this old truck go by and went bam!
2110760	2113760	He just jokingly fell down like he had been shot.
2113760	2116760	And then an LAPD cop car came,
2116760	2120760	U-turn and came up on the curb going the wrong way on the street.
2120760	2122760	And two guys emerged from it,
2122760	2126760	two officers with guns out of their holsters, not pointed at us,
2126760	2129760	but guns out of their holsters, screaming to me,
2129760	2132760	Oh, Kenny falls down. Matt keeps walking.
2132760	2133760	And I'm kind of like,
2133760	2135760	Like that's just standing there.
2135760	2137760	Like, you know, like that taunting him,
2137760	2140760	but like that, I got a funny bit, like get back up or whatever.
2140760	2143760	And the cops screaming at me,
2143760	2145760	Get against the wall! Get against the wall!
2145760	2147760	And they're like freaking out.
2147760	2150760	Not like, like, freeze.
2150760	2151760	Get your hands up.
2151760	2152760	No cop show stuff.
2152760	2154760	Losing their minds.
2154760	2157760	And now at this point, Kenny's getting up and he's fine.
2157760	2159760	I'm like, Jesus Christ, what's going on?
2159760	2160760	What the fuck is going on?
2160760	2161760	You don't get the wall.
2161760	2162760	I'm like, what's going on?
2162760	2163760	Oh, my God.
2163760	2166760	And Kenny's like, the car backfired, bro.
2166760	2168760	And one of the cops was like,
2168760	2172760	Oh, Jesus Christ.
2172760	2173760	Jesus Christ.
2173760	2175760	I thought you killed him.
2175760	2179760	I was like, put your guns away.
2179760	2181760	This story is called Cops Are Human.
2181760	2184760	I mean, they didn't know who to shoot.
2184760	2185760	Here's a story called Cops Are Human.
2185760	2187760	Don't give them guns.
2187760	2189760	Well, no more fucking guns.
2189760	2190760	But at least, I don't know.
2190760	2193760	I kind of, that sounds like, that's the best cop story I've ever heard.
2193760	2195760	I almost got shot to pieces because these guys...
2195760	2197760	You didn't almost get shot to pieces.
2197760	2200760	They took their guns out because they thought that someone got shot
2200760	2201760	and they didn't know who.
2201760	2202760	But they weren't being cool about it.
2202760	2204760	Well, they...
2204760	2206760	Thank God because, thank God they're not cyborgs.
2206760	2207760	No.
2207760	2208760	I don't know.
2208760	2210760	No, fuckers get shot because they accidentally...
2210760	2211760	The bad version of the story would have been like,
2211760	2215760	if they pointed a gun at someone's face and were like, you know what I mean?
2215760	2216760	I don't know.
2216760	2219760	They panicked because they thought someone actually was needed to help.
2219760	2224760	A crazy post-traumatic stress disorder cop threatened to kill everybody in the LAPD
2224760	2228760	and their response was to go in and start shooting Mexican ladies and stuff like that.
2228760	2229760	Yeah.
2229760	2230760	Well, I mean, God knows.
2230760	2231760	Jesus Christ.
2231760	2235760	I mean, the LAPD is the only police force in the country.
2235760	2241760	And strangely, I know this only because I wrote a sitcom script for...
2241760	2243760	called Cop House.
2248760	2250760	So I researched...
2250760	2251760	I forgot that was the name.
2251760	2253760	I researched the...
2253760	2256760	It was based on an internal idea about a bunch of...
2256760	2257760	It's about the house as a cop.
2257760	2258760	Yeah.
2261760	2263760	It's kind of like Monster House.
2265760	2266760	Here comes the neighborhood.
2266760	2267760	A house...
2274760	2278760	A house is so tired of being robbed and broken into.
2278760	2279760	It's set in the future.
2279760	2282760	All houses are monsters, but some of them are trying to make things right.
2283760	2288760	There are over 18 million 911 calls about monster houses in LA.
2289760	2291760	One house has had too much.
2292760	2297760	I was researching the LAPD and it was like in the wake of the Rodney King business
2297760	2298760	and then there was this other...
2298760	2302760	Was it on the tail of that or right before that, but it was like the Rampart scandal
2302760	2306760	where there was an anti-gang task force in the LAPD.
2306760	2308760	It was like, look, we have a huge gang problem.
2309760	2313760	Let's devote a force of police, like a little squad.
2313760	2317760	You guys are just anti-gang in Rampart district.
2318760	2319760	That's all you care about.
2319760	2321760	It's just like gang activity.
2321760	2323760	Just get it down, which is just like saying to RoboCop.
2323760	2325760	Just like, go get them, boy.
2326760	2329760	They, of course, probably make an amazing movie.
2329760	2332760	I'm sure they probably made three bad movies about it in one sense or another
2332760	2335760	that have Jake Gyllenhaal or Shia LaBeouf in it or something.
2336760	2337760	I think colors, right?
2338760	2345760	But essentially they became another gang because they just got mired in it.
2345760	2350760	But the bad thing about that is that they're a gang that you can't call the cops on at all.
2350760	2352760	So they're a gang that has...
2352760	2354760	So there was horrible things happening.
2354760	2359760	Long story short, if there was a cop here in the audience or somebody that worked in law enforcement,
2359760	2363760	I'd love to... I'm sure it's easy to pinata the most loathful...
2363760	2365760	We have an admiral over here.
2366760	2372760	But the LAPD is the only police force in the United States history to my knowledge
2372760	2374760	that has ever been like...
2374760	2378760	It had to have the Department of Justice take it over and oversee it.
2379760	2382760	Every other city that you can name it as a police force,
2382760	2386760	they have their ups and they have their downs and they have their scandals and stuff.
2386760	2389760	But the LAPD just had so much shit going on in a row
2389760	2393760	that at one point the federal government started running the LAPD,
2393760	2397760	which is so close to how many consumer products coming in.
2398760	2401760	It's really fascinating, like the 90s in L.A. and the police force.
2401760	2402760	Who cares? It's fascinating.
2402760	2403760	So Google it.
2403760	2405760	On the other hand, if you want to be entertained, listen to me.
2408760	2409760	Sorry.
2410760	2413760	Let's keep the show rolling and bring up more friends.
2413760	2414760	Who do you got?
2418760	2421760	Let's start off with Spencer on stage for one. How about that?
2423760	2424760	Thank you.
2435760	2437760	Spencer, our dungeon master.
2437760	2440760	I lost a button in the bathroom.
2440760	2443760	Yeah, I know. As you told me, someone up here was the show.
2445760	2447760	What's going on at the Apple Store?
2448760	2451760	Okay, so there's a thing called PI, physical inventory.
2451760	2453760	It happens twice a year.
2454760	2457760	Usually we get like two months to prepare for it
2457760	2460760	and they told us like six days ago.
2460760	2463760	They're like PIs in a matter of weeks.
2463760	2466760	They told us under three weeks ago, I guess, around.
2467760	2469760	And we're also two people down on our team,
2469760	2472760	so we're kind of screwed, but also it's fine.
2473760	2476760	It's like sweeps week. This is like crucial times.
2476760	2477760	Yeah, yeah.
2477760	2480760	See, as you guys might know, I count stuff.
2480760	2482760	This is counting to the extreme.
2483760	2486760	This is where the till has to match.
2487760	2490760	Well, we have computers that we use,
2490760	2492760	and we have like iPods that we use and iPads,
2492760	2494760	and like there's a bunch of them,
2494760	2496760	but we got to account for all of them
2496760	2498760	and make sure all the iPads are in order,
2498760	2500760	and they get lost. It's crazy.
2500760	2502760	You wouldn't think you'd lose stuff like that,
2502760	2504760	but it happens and people hide them and stuff.
2504760	2506760	Yeah, you wouldn't think working in a giant warehouse
2506760	2508760	full of really expensive.
2508760	2510760	There's a small area in the back.
2510760	2512760	The floor is really wide and expansive,
2512760	2514760	but in the back there's like whoop, whoop, whoop, nothing.
2514760	2516760	Do Apple employees, is it possible?
2516760	2518760	Because those stores are so slick
2518760	2520760	and it's such a well-oiled machine.
2520760	2522760	Is it possible to steal stuff in the back,
2522760	2524760	like getting employees?
2524760	2527760	Because I work at Trader Joe's and I rob that fucker blind.
2529760	2532760	But those are potato chips and fucking beer and shit.
2532760	2534760	When my older brother worked there,
2534760	2536760	I heard stories of sometimes that stuff happening,
2536760	2538760	but I've never seen it happen,
2538760	2540760	and if I did, I probably shouldn't talk about it.
2540760	2543760	But honestly, honestly, I haven't seen it happen.
2544760	2546760	I would imagine it'd be hard to get...
2546760	2548760	Because we count it so well.
2548760	2549760	Yeah.
2549760	2550760	But like you said once,
2550760	2551760	which is one of my favorite quotes,
2551760	2553760	sometimes you just count less.
2553760	2554760	Sometimes, yeah.
2554760	2556760	That was a joke, yeah.
2557760	2560760	For like a biopic where Spencer is like,
2560760	2564760	it's like a period film created in the future
2564760	2566760	about like a great Apple thief.
2566760	2568760	We had an idea of stealing batteries.
2568760	2570760	Sometimes you just count less.
2570760	2572760	He was Apple's most wanted.
2572760	2574760	See, here's the plot though.
2574760	2576760	When they swap out mice and keyboards,
2576760	2578760	they give those back to us.
2578760	2579760	They don't need those batteries.
2579760	2582760	You take those batteries out, that's two double A's.
2583760	2585760	That's a potential profit of, you know,
2585760	2588760	three to four dollars on the black market, you know?
2588760	2589760	That's nice.
2589760	2591760	See, you're just swimming in batteries back home.
2591760	2593760	Just dealing in batteries.
2594760	2595760	No, I don't know.
2595760	2597760	It's a good idea, right?
2597760	2598760	No.
2598760	2600760	Well, I mean, it could use a little work, I guess.
2600760	2601760	All right.
2601760	2603760	Oh, we'll workshop it.
2603760	2605760	I have a retraction to make.
2605760	2607760	Bruce Volanche.
2608760	2611760	Who Dan dealt a pretty strong blow to last week.
2611760	2614760	I said, to recap, as quickly as possible,
2614760	2616760	what I said, and my mistake was,
2616760	2619760	because Schwab told me third hand,
2619760	2621760	we were at the office and he said,
2621760	2623760	and I recounted this thing like,
2623760	2625760	oh, somebody wrote an article and they said,
2625760	2627760	hey, you should fire Bruce Volanche from the Oscars.
2627760	2628760	That's how you make them better.
2628760	2632760	Bruce Volanche wrote a comment under it saying,
2633760	2634760	well, I'm very sorry, you don't like me,
2634760	2636760	but, you know, we all wrote that Oscar opening together
2636760	2637760	and blah, blah, blah.
2637760	2641760	It's definitely a cautionary tale.
2641760	2643760	This is how urban legends and gossip get started
2643760	2645760	because somebody linked to that article.
2645760	2648760	I went and looked at it and Rob was not inaccurate
2648760	2649760	in what he was reporting to me,
2649760	2657760	but the Asian American telephone of it all turned it into,
2657760	2661760	I don't know what the, we've been over this.
2661760	2662760	You could just say telephone game.
2662760	2664760	When I was in the Midwest,
2664760	2665760	when I was in the Midwest,
2665760	2668760	it was called the Chinese telephone.
2668760	2670760	Why would you balk at that?
2670760	2673760	You assumed a murderer was a black guy earlier.
2673760	2675760	Because we already talked about it on this podcast
2675760	2677760	and I don't want to become Prairie Home Companion
2677760	2679760	where it's just like, I don't know, beep-bop-a-roop-bop,
2679760	2681760	rhubarb pie.
2681760	2682760	I know I'm racist.
2682760	2683760	We get it.
2686760	2690760	But I looked at the article that we were talking about,
2690760	2693760	for those of you who listened to a couple of episodes back,
2693760	2696760	and I looked at the comment that Bruce wrote,
2696760	2700760	and I don't think that he's guilty of anything worthy of me
2700760	2701760	like maligning him.
2701760	2706760	He said we wrote and we rewrote the Oscars together
2706760	2708760	kind of like, which in general is true.
2708760	2710760	I mean, we did sit there in a room together
2710760	2712760	and try to write jokes that Hugh Jackman should be saying.
2712760	2715760	He didn't actually, he never said,
2715760	2718760	like, I wrote the reader dance or anything.
2718760	2721760	He didn't claim authorship of anything.
2721760	2724760	He's not a weird liar, Bruce.
2724760	2727760	If you're out there listening, you're just weird.
2727760	2730760	Sorry, I feel bad.
2730760	2732760	I've also been wrong about other things.
2732760	2735760	Offhand, I repeated some thing.
2735760	2737760	Erin McGathey always opts out
2737760	2739760	when we go through the TSA checkpoints,
2739760	2742760	and she keeps saying this thing that I repeated on stage,
2742760	2744760	which is that they're not a government agency.
2744760	2745760	They're a private company.
2745760	2746760	And then somebody tweeted me and said,
2746760	2747760	what the fuck are you saying?
2747760	2748760	What are you getting?
2748760	2749760	I looked it up.
2749760	2750760	That's not true either.
2750760	2753760	So one should be careful sometimes.
2753760	2756760	One should tend one's own garden.
2756760	2758760	That's how you stay honest.
2758760	2760760	You don't have to worry about saying something
2761760	2763760	that needs to be retracted.
2763760	2768760	Spencer's mom is a lesbian.
2768760	2769760	Yeah, so retraction there.
2769760	2776760	You didn't actually end up fucking it, right?
2776760	2779760	Why do you think I would call her a lesbian?
2779760	2781760	That's a title I reserve only for women
2781760	2784760	that won't do it with me.
2784760	2787760	All right, well, let's keep the bullet train speeding along
2787760	2790760	and bring up Kumail, because he's going to play D&D.
2790760	2792760	All right, Kumail Nanjiani.
2798760	2800760	Hello, hello.
2800760	2803760	I thought that was the THX sound.
2803760	2805760	My congested ears heard that as the...
2805760	2806760	What was it?
2806760	2808760	It's one of our rap beats.
2808760	2811760	Oh, rap beats.
2811760	2812760	Pretty racist.
2813760	2817760	By the way, I worked at a school that had laptops,
2817760	2822760	and I was responsible for about 300 laptops, MacBooks,
2822760	2829760	and I probably lost about 70 of them and then quit
2829760	2831760	before they could count.
2831760	2832760	And I just...
2832760	2834760	It sucks, because I became friends with these people
2834760	2836760	that worked there for five years.
2836760	2838760	And I was really good at having them not find out
2838760	2839760	that shit was missing.
2839760	2842760	That was like the only thing I was good at.
2842760	2845760	And so when I was leaving, it was this house of cards,
2845760	2847760	and I was like, hey, I'm going to quit.
2847760	2848760	They were like, what?
2848760	2849760	But we need you.
2849760	2850760	And I was like, you're going to find out
2850760	2853760	how little you need me.
2853760	2856760	When you find out how much you wish I was here
2856760	2857760	to answer questions.
2857760	2858760	Yeah, exactly.
2858760	2861760	And I just left, and I ignored their calls,
2861760	2864760	and I just never fucking talked to them again.
2864760	2865760	And it wasn't my fault.
2865760	2867760	I never stole or sold any of them.
2867760	2869760	They were just disappearing.
2869760	2870760	It can happen, man.
2870760	2871760	I don't know what was happening.
2871760	2872760	Crazy, right?
2872760	2874760	I should have done PI more often.
2874760	2875760	Yeah.
2875760	2878760	I bet everybody's got a story about an early job they had
2878760	2880760	where they walked away from it in fucking...
2880760	2882760	Like they just burnt down behind it.
2882760	2883760	I know.
2883760	2885760	If you think of like 70 computers,
2885760	2892760	each one about $1,000 even, that's over $70,000.
2892760	2894760	And I just left.
2895760	2899760	I moved to a different city, and I changed my career.
2899760	2901760	And I bet if they see me on TV, they're like,
2901760	2903760	there's that fucker who like...
2903760	2907760	Because I swear to you, that program went under
2907760	2909760	the year after I left.
2909760	2912760	They're burning me off of Apple.
2912760	2913760	There's two benefits from it.
2913760	2915760	So somebody there was pinching them?
2915760	2916760	I don't know.
2916760	2917760	This was on the south side of Chicago,
2917760	2919760	which is like a pretty rough area,
2919760	2920760	and kids were always getting over it.
2920760	2921760	It's the baddest part of town.
2921760	2923760	Yeah, bad, bad.
2923760	2924760	Yeah.
2924760	2926760	Leroy Brown, is that what we're doing?
2926760	2929760	Yes, we're doing Bad Bad Leroy Brown right now.
2929760	2931760	Fuck you, man.
2931760	2934760	You suckered me into that.
2934760	2935760	I hate Jim Croce.
2935760	2938760	I'm just saying, if you go down there,
2938760	2943760	you better just beware of a man named Leroy Brown.
2943760	2947760	These children don't know what you're talking about.
2947760	2950760	You're just being a weird old man right now.
2950760	2952760	My rendition is so accurate
2952760	2956760	that you could shazam this conversation.
2956760	2957760	He got it back.
2957760	2958760	I had also...
2958760	2961760	Shazam's still a thing, right?
2961760	2962760	You still shazam?
2962760	2964760	Was it called, like, Bahooki?
2964760	2965760	I don't know.
2965760	2967760	Yeah, Bahooki.
2967760	2969760	With cops, by the way, I grew up,
2969760	2971760	like I said, in Pakistan, and it's so corrupt there.
2971760	2974760	Like, the cops are just uniformly bad Pakistan and India.
2974760	2976760	If you watch any movies from the 80s and 90s,
2976760	2978760	the bad guys were always cops.
2978760	2979760	Always cops.
2979760	2980760	Always cops.
2980760	2982760	So I, like, moved and I fucking, like, I'm so...
2982760	2983760	I hate them.
2983760	2985760	And I'm, like, I don't know.
2985760	2986760	I still distrust them.
2986760	2988760	It's terrible because you can't think of a worse job,
2988760	2990760	a job that no one would rather do.
2990760	2993760	I think it's like schoolteachers, cops,
2993760	2997760	let's throw in stylists.
2997760	2998760	Like, we need to...
2998760	2999760	No, I'm kidding on the last one.
2999760	3000760	We need to...
3000760	3004760	Just schoolteachers and cops.
3004760	3005760	I mean, I mean...
3005760	3007760	We obviously need them.
3007760	3011760	Don't you think you break the cycle by throwing in a country
3011760	3012760	where we kind of...
3012760	3014760	We do tend to...
3014760	3016760	I know that every penny counts,
3016760	3019760	but we also have spent more on worse.
3019760	3021760	Like, don't you break the cycle by, like, going,
3021760	3024760	hey, from now on, being a cop pays a lot.
3024760	3026760	Like, don't you think...
3026760	3028760	Because right now we're at this place where it's like,
3028760	3031760	it doesn't pay that much and you might get shot.
3031760	3033760	Yeah, so the people would go into it.
3033760	3036760	Like, you need cops, but a lot of people who become cops,
3036760	3038760	you don't want to be cops.
3038760	3039760	I got...
3039760	3041760	I was walking across the street.
3041760	3044760	I was jaywalking with my wife,
3044760	3046760	who's not very threatening looking at all,
3046760	3048760	and these fucking cops pulled up,
3048760	3050760	and they started yelling at us,
3050760	3053760	and, like, they had me up against the wall,
3053760	3054760	hands behind my back,
3054760	3056760	and I was so fucking angry.
3056760	3057760	I was asking them, I swear, I was like,
3057760	3061760	so is this the biggest bust you've had?
3061760	3064760	And I was like, so is this why you got into the game?
3064760	3067760	I called it the game.
3067760	3068760	And Emily's like, just shut up.
3068760	3069760	What'd you say? What'd you say?
3069760	3071760	They were... Emily just...
3071760	3074760	And I'd just done a show at the Echo,
3074760	3076760	and I'd left a bit early,
3076760	3078760	so while I'm there,
3078760	3081760	all the people who'd just seen me at the show
3081760	3082760	are walking by, and they're like,
3082760	3083760	hey, great show.
3083760	3084760	I'm like, okay, cool.
3084760	3087760	Not a good time right now.
3087760	3088760	It's pretty cool.
3088760	3089760	Oh, my God.
3089760	3091760	The next week you were opening, though.
3091760	3093760	Wait, opening's bad.
3093760	3095760	Closing.
3095760	3097760	My brain is dying.
3097760	3100760	By the way, have you seen posters for Sharknado?
3100760	3102760	No.
3102760	3104760	There's a movie called Sharknado.
3104760	3105760	Yeah.
3105760	3111760	It's set in Oklahoma during tornado season.
3111760	3113760	Yeah, and it's a tornado,
3113760	3117760	and the posters, there's a hand-drawn tornado
3117760	3119760	with shark heads poking out of it.
3119760	3121760	I mean, are you doing a bit or is it real?
3121760	3122760	No, no, no.
3122760	3123760	This is real.
3123760	3124760	Oh, I thought you were just doing a fucking thing.
3124760	3125760	No, no.
3125760	3126760	This is real.
3126760	3127760	That's the problem.
3127760	3128760	That's the problem.
3128760	3129760	It doesn't matter now.
3129760	3130760	It's real.
3130760	3131760	Sharknado.
3131760	3132760	It would be like nothing.
3132760	3133760	They'd be dead, right?
3133760	3134760	Yes.
3134760	3137760	Tea sharks, they're dizzy and dead.
3137760	3140760	If you're auditioning for the role of the mayor
3140760	3142760	in the first act, you're hired.
3142760	3144760	Guys, we have nothing to worry about.
3144760	3146760	Come on, they'd be dead.
3146760	3147760	They're dead.
3147760	3149760	Can I be the sharkologist?
3149760	3151760	Yes, the annual corn festival stays open.
3152760	3155760	We've known two things about sharks for 50,000 years.
3155760	3157760	One is that they live underwater.
3157760	3159760	Two is that they can't stop moving.
3159760	3161760	We thought the first thing was what was keeping them alive.
3161760	3163760	Freeze!
3163760	3164760	You're good, Dan.
3164760	3167760	It turns out they only have to keep moving.
3167760	3170760	No one has ever kept a shark moving out of water.
3170760	3172760	And just like a truck shark.
3172760	3173760	What if the tornado is water?
3173760	3175760	What if it's a water tornado?
3175760	3177760	You're talking about a hurricane.
3177760	3178760	That's the sequel.
3179760	3183760	But there's one house that won't be taken over by the Sharknado.
3183760	3186760	Shark house, monster house.
3186760	3188760	You should have a movie called Shark House.
3188760	3190760	I'll find the Sharknado picture for you
3190760	3192760	to prove that it wasn't just a lame bit I was doing.
3192760	3193760	It's a real movie.
3193760	3194760	No, you don't have to prove it.
3194760	3196760	That's the sad thing is that now irony has become...
3196760	3197760	I think it's a good thing.
3197760	3199760	It's an invitation now to like...
3199760	3201760	I think that we used to live in a world
3201760	3204760	where the division between the people who made entertainment
3204760	3207760	and the people that consumed it was so thick
3207760	3210760	that it was, you know, one of the most enjoyable things
3210760	3212760	was them doing their job wrong.
3212760	3214760	But now we can all do it anyway.
3214760	3216760	So now it's like, now of course the first thing we're going to do
3216760	3221760	is go, hey, this show's called Dick, Dick, Dick Gator.
3221760	3222760	Is it...
3222760	3225760	I thought it was a gator who's like a dick.
3225760	3227760	Is it...
3227760	3229760	Douche Crocodile.
3229760	3230760	But here's my problem.
3230760	3231760	If there already is a thing...
3231760	3232760	Is it already out or is it...
3232760	3233760	No.
3233760	3234760	Here's the poster.
3234760	3235760	I forgot to mention this.
3235760	3238760	The tagline is enough said.
3238760	3239760	No.
3239760	3241760	No, I think we need a bit more.
3241760	3242760	No.
3242760	3243760	Look at that.
3243760	3244760	Not enough said.
3244760	3245760	Enough said.
3245760	3246760	Enough said.
3246760	3247760	No, the sharks are dead.
3247760	3250760	Enough said exclamation point, which is another weird thing.
3250760	3252760	Enough said!
3252760	3253760	But how about this?
3253760	3258760	There is a thing that's already being made called Sharknado.
3258760	3260760	But the one Adam Goldberg was talking about
3260760	3262760	is called Avalanche Shark.
3262760	3265760	They didn't even go like Shark-a-lanche or...
3265760	3269760	If you just do that, sharks are officially the new ninja.
3269760	3273760	Is it Avalanche-colon-shark like Mission Call It Impossible?
3273760	3274760	I don't even know.
3274760	3275760	It was both.
3275760	3276760	The name was neither.
3276760	3277760	It was Avalanche Shark.
3277760	3278760	Then it was Shark Avalanche.
3278760	3281760	Then it was Avalanche Sharks when they had three puppets.
3281760	3283760	And then they cut back on the number of puppets.
3283760	3286760	And then they cut back on the number of production managers.
3286760	3289760	And that's when you jump a ship.
3289760	3294760	And then it became an evening with a shark off-Broadway.
3294760	3295760	Just say, yeah.
3295760	3297760	I was born a little shark.
3297760	3300760	And then it finally became Argo.
3300760	3302760	That's how Hollywood works.
3302760	3303760	No, it's crazy.
3303760	3304760	Yeah, it's true.
3304760	3306760	Good rewrite.
3306760	3308760	So I'm going to guess.
3308760	3312760	Tremors was a kind of a parody of Jaws.
3312760	3315760	Like Tremors was written like in the 70s.
3315760	3316760	Really?
3316760	3318760	After Jaws was popular, they wrote the script that was like
3318760	3322760	they're sharks, but they're under dirt instead of water.
3322760	3324760	And then it took that long for Tremors to come out.
3324760	3328760	I like Tremors because is it the third one where they start flying?
3328760	3329760	Yeah.
3329760	3332760	And then the fourth one is because Michael Gross is the only one
3332760	3333760	who keeps coming back.
3333760	3334760	He's done all of them.
3334760	3336760	So there's one that's set in the Wild West.
3336760	3337760	It's a prequel.
3337760	3339760	And there's Tremors there.
3339760	3340760	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3340760	3342760	And Michael Gross's ancestor fights him,
3342760	3343760	which at that point-
3343760	3344760	Wait, by whom?
3344760	3345760	Michael Gross.
3345760	3346760	Yeah, okay.
3346760	3347760	He's back.
3347760	3350760	That should have like made the news or the lore,
3350760	3351760	and they should have been like,
3351760	3354760	hey, stay away from this area like 200 years ago.
3354760	3356760	These fucking Tremors showed up.
3356760	3358760	And what are the odds that Michael Gross comes back?
3358760	3359760	Well, a lot of problems.
3359760	3361760	Well, he registered on the local radar of one guy who stayed in his basement
3361760	3363760	and started hoarding firearms.
3363760	3365760	It holds up.
3365760	3368760	I like the Tremors saga.
3371760	3372760	Shall we play some D&D?
3372760	3373760	Let's do it.
3373760	3375760	All right, Aaron McGathey, would you join us on stage, please?
3376760	3385760	Oh, Jesus Christ, don't ever, ever, ever sneak up on me again.
3385760	3386760	Hello.
3386760	3388760	Aaron McGathey, everyone.
3388760	3390760	Hey, guys.
3390760	3391760	Sharks.
3391760	3393760	Yeah.
3393760	3395760	Her mic is not on.
3395760	3396760	Give it a try.
3396760	3397760	Sharks.
3397760	3399760	There we go.
3399760	3401760	Shark lobby.
3401760	3403760	It's good news, though.
3403760	3404760	There will have to be a new-
3404760	3407760	There's going to be a nerd shark movie soon, I bet.
3407760	3408760	Like a half nerd, half shark.
3408760	3411760	He's just like, because nerds are, you know, the big thing right now.
3411760	3413760	Shaq called himself a geek today.
3413760	3416760	So I'm like, come on.
3416760	3419760	Nerds will have to come up with new ways.
3419760	3427760	Somehow, the robot ninja, Abraham Lincoln, shark, laser,
3427760	3430760	kind of like that concept, that all comes from the-
3430760	3431760	Pirate.
3431760	3432760	Yeah.
3432760	3434760	It comes from this period of time when it was like we were being
3434760	3436760	dispensed entertainment by this big thing.
3436760	3439760	So there's like this wacky packages irony going on to it.
3439760	3440760	These aren't crayola crayons.
3440760	3442760	These are crackola crayons.
3442760	3447760	So I guess it's a- we're living in a kind of a satirically dead age
3447760	3451760	that will be a precursor to like a new, I think, a new reckoning.
3451760	3452760	Since that already, yeah.
3452760	3455760	Where I will be completely like, I'll just be a dinosaur.
3455760	3457760	As if I'm not already, but I'll be absolutely-
3457760	3460760	I don't even know why that's funny and everyone will be like, exactly.
3461760	3462760	Step aside.
3463760	3467760	There's some shows on Adult Swim that make me feel so old.
3469760	3470760	Yeah.
3470760	3472760	I've watched like-
3472760	3474760	What? Like Squidbillies?
3475760	3477760	Have you seen that show?
3477760	3478760	No, no, no.
3478760	3479760	It's impenetrable.
3481760	3483760	I'll tell you something I watched that made me feel 20.
3483760	3485760	It was like fucking the most powerful guy in the room.
3485760	3488760	This movie called the ABCs of Horror.
3488760	3489760	Oh, how is that?
3490760	3493760	It should be called 26 Channel 101 Rejections.
3495760	3500760	What also sucks about that format is that you're hyper-aware of how much of the movie is left.
3500760	3501760	Yeah.
3501760	3503760	Because you're like, I'm only at the G.
3503760	3504760	Yeah.
3504760	3508760	The good thing about it is knowing you're never more than three minutes away from-
3511760	3513760	But you start to go like, it's not starting.
3513760	3514760	It's never going to start.
3514760	3517760	And even if it does start, it's going to putter out.
3517760	3518760	Four minutes, yeah.
3519760	3521760	I think we started feeling pretty OCD about it.
3521760	3523760	Like, we're already 20 in.
3523760	3527760	Well, we started the first 11, kept going like, so C is for carnivore?
3527760	3528760	C is for that.
3528760	3529760	And then we start, we go, what are we doing?
3529760	3530760	It doesn't matter.
3530760	3534760	Because somebody actually told me that it was a part of that project.
3534760	3535760	They said, yeah, we got them.
3535760	3538760	And we had to shuffle the order because we had to.
3538760	3541760	So we started pretending that the letter was different.
3541760	3542760	Wait, they changed-
3542760	3546760	Like if you made a shitty one called the H is for helicopter,
3546760	3548760	because it cut a guy's head off, but it was so shitty.
3548760	3550760	They would just go, let's just say-
3550760	3551760	It's for half.
3551760	3552760	P is for pilot.
3552760	3553760	Yeah.
3553760	3555760	And let's tell the P guy that-
3555760	3558760	Oh, wow, that sucks.
3558760	3561760	Yeah, it was very clear that the words didn't inspire the horror.
3561760	3564760	Also, barely any horror.
3564760	3568760	Literally like four or five, and I say in quotes, scary ones.
3568760	3572760	There was a cartoon about a woman trying to get her poop inside a toilet.
3572760	3574760	What do you mean?
3574760	3576760	That.
3576760	3579760	Is the poop out of her or is it in her?
3579760	3582760	There was a woman, it was animated.
3582760	3583760	Is this P?
3583760	3584760	No, this is poop.
3584760	3585760	No, it's P.
3585760	3586760	Oh, I see.
3586760	3587760	No, no.
3587760	3589760	Nice, nice.
3589760	3591760	Thank you very much.
3591760	3593760	We're going to be touring together.
3593760	3596760	Shoes and socks, ladies and gentlemen.
3596760	3597760	Yeah.
3597760	3599760	Cheese, shoes, and I'm Kumail.
3599760	3604760	What do you say, Kumail?
3604760	3607760	Shoes, you got it again.
3607760	3612760	All right, it's D&D time, I'd say on that note.
3612760	3615760	That's my catchphrase.
3615760	3618760	Spencer, if you would, catch us up.
3618760	3625760	When we last met, the group was plumbing the depths of the ruins of Mershul.
3625760	3628760	Krista Berg was caught in a deadly wall-crushing trap.
3628760	3633760	Thinking quickly, the rogue found a narrow escape and leapt with great alacrity through a hole in the floor,
3633760	3635760	landing in a dank, dark chamber.
3635760	3639760	Sharpie Quirk and Mulrain were not far behind, and after some crossed wires,
3639760	3642760	the group managed to slide down the button staff.
3642760	3647760	Working on unlocking the chamber door, the rogue toiled while the rest of the gang searched the room.
3647760	3650760	It wasn't long before the group was besieged by snakes.
3650760	3655760	After seeming to fall from Mulrain's animal husbandry, the snakes transformed into Yuan Ti,
3655760	3657760	sinister serpent people.
3657760	3661760	After putting on a seemingly clever disguise, the hat of disguise,
3661760	3664760	the gang tried to convince the snakes they were holding a hostage,
3664760	3669760	but Quirk's talking dagger ruined the gang with his sharp dung, foul move.
3669760	3672760	Down, but not out, they launched into a new gag,
3672760	3677760	Quirk creeping behind the lead snake and Sharpie pushing him over the crouched halfling, tripping him.
3677760	3680760	This spooked the snake people into loosing their ballows of poison arrows,
3680760	3682760	which struck Sharpie in his chest and arm.
3682760	3686760	He began to feel drowsy and as if he was feeling numb,
3686760	3691760	the party managed to kill two of the foes before the last member of the group fled in snake form,
3691760	3693760	managing to elude the party's grasp.
3693760	3697760	After combat ended, the rogue managed to finish picking the lock on the door,
3697760	3700760	peering through crack at the massive treasure room before them.
3700760	3704760	Just then, Sharpie felt a rush of dizziness and lost consciousness.
3704760	3705760	Thump.
3705760	3706760	You did it again!
3711760	3714760	I'm convinced, Spencer, that you've listened to this podcast,
3714760	3716760	you've timed out the music queue,
3716760	3721760	and you write this to be timed perfectly to this.
3721760	3724760	I mean, the thing is, like, I write it on my iPad nowadays,
3724760	3726760	and I just write, like, the same size of text.
3726760	3727760	The same size, yeah.
3727760	3729760	It works amazing, though.
3729760	3734760	I heard there's a video of you, the way there is of Bruce Springsteen practicing his opening.
3735760	3736760	No? Okay.
3740760	3743760	There's an urban legend or a real tape out there.
3743760	3746760	I don't know if it's just an urban legend or if there's a real tape,
3746760	3749760	but somebody slept over at Bruce Springsteen's house and found a tape of him,
3749760	3752760	a VHS tape of him practicing,
3752760	3754760	dancing in the dark in a mirror.
3754760	3755760	Really?
3755760	3756760	It's probably an urban legend.
3756760	3757760	I'd love to see it.
3757760	3758760	From, like, back in the day?
3758760	3759760	Yeah, yeah.
3760760	3762760	Was it like the Metallica drummer guy,
3762760	3764760	the guy that drummed the entire black album?
3764760	3765760	No, that exists, right?
3765760	3766760	That's just a guy.
3766760	3768760	That was fucking great.
3768760	3769760	All right, so what's going on?
3769760	3771760	We're looking through a crack in the thing?
3771760	3773760	Bruce Springsteen?
3773760	3775760	He was a guy...
3777760	3779760	I know, during Reaganomics,
3779760	3783760	we had to make sure it was extra cool to be lower class.
3783760	3784760	Reaganomics.
3784760	3787760	So we rolled out some rich people with bandanas.
3787760	3790760	That was the best class in history, was Reaganomics.
3792760	3794760	I mean glossary term.
3795760	3797760	Can we see that Sharpie's fallen down?
3797760	3798760	Who is Sharpie?
3798760	3799760	Yeah, that's Dan.
3799760	3800760	Oh, okay.
3801760	3805760	Can I have, like, an HBO original series dream sequence?
3805760	3807760	Yeah, you're in a dungeon, though.
3807760	3809760	I mean, like, you're having a dream sequence.
3809760	3810760	But I'm unconscious.
3810760	3811760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3811760	3814760	Okay, so I'm on a beach.
3814760	3815760	We don't know that.
3818760	3820760	Someone is getting stabbed.
3822760	3824760	I look out over the ocean,
3824760	3826760	and instead of the sun rising over it,
3826760	3828760	it's my dad's head.
3830760	3832760	And I start to run away,
3832760	3835760	and I run through a nearby jungle,
3835760	3837760	and I come to a cabin,
3837760	3840760	and I go inside, and there's a birthday cake,
3840760	3842760	and there's 13 candles on it,
3842760	3844760	and a fish in the middle.
3845760	3848760	And I pick up the fish,
3848760	3850760	and it looks at me and says,
3850760	3852760	Sopranos reference.
3854760	3856760	So I put it down,
3856760	3858760	and I go with my second thought.
3860760	3862760	I go to a fireplace,
3862760	3864760	and I start to stoke the flame,
3864760	3867760	but there's nothing but oatmeal in it.
3870760	3871760	And then I wake up.
3871760	3873760	Or cut to them.
3874760	3875760	Cut to them.
3875760	3877760	Hey, what do you guys think he's dreaming about?
3877760	3879760	Same old stuff, probably.
3881760	3883760	So I'm working on the lock.
3884760	3885760	What's huh?
3885760	3886760	I'm working on the lock.
3886760	3887760	You had just picked the lock,
3887760	3889760	and you guys had opened it.
3889760	3891760	There's treasure inside.
3891760	3893760	In the room, yeah, there's treasure.
3893760	3894760	Let me see here.
3894760	3896760	You can see a large stone chamber
3896760	3899760	in the center of which is three large humanoid statues,
3899760	3901760	and next to them is a small wooden shed
3901760	3903760	and a few wooden buckets.
3903760	3905760	Behind the statues is a massive stone staircase
3905760	3908760	leading up about 80 feet in large tiered steps.
3908760	3911760	At the top is a massive sarcophagus made of obsidian.
3911760	3913760	It's surrounded by several chests and barrels
3913760	3916760	and baskets of goods, I should say,
3916760	3918760	heaped up in some form of tribute.
3918760	3921760	In the middle of the staircase is a massive deep black crack,
3921760	3923760	and inky darkness blocks out any light
3923760	3925760	that you could help see into the small cave.
3925760	3928760	You see coins tossed around the cavern.
3928760	3930760	I mean the chamber.
3930760	3933760	Do I have any sort of antidote or something I can use on him?
3933760	3934760	I don't know.
3934760	3936760	I mean, does it say anything like that?
3936760	3938760	You shouldn't.
3938760	3939760	I shouldn't?
3939760	3940760	I don't think so.
3940760	3942760	Well, you created me, so I'm sure I don't.
3942760	3943760	Yeah, but it happened a while ago.
3943760	3945760	I have heal moderate wounds, do I not?
3945760	3950760	Yeah, but this is more of like a sleeping poison.
3950760	3952760	Oh, it's not deadly.
3952760	3954760	Well, you don't know, really.
3954760	3955760	It's freaky.
3955760	3957760	He was like, he was losing anything.
3957760	3959760	I reach into my sack and take out a pen,
3959760	3963760	and I draw a dick and ball on his forehead.
3963760	3966760	I teabag him, yeah.
3966760	3969760	And I cover him in swastikas,
3969760	3974760	and we try to get the horse to fuck.
3974760	3977760	I take his hand, and I pretend that we're getting married.
3977760	3981760	I put his other hand in a bucket of warm water,
3981760	3984760	and then I just piss on his hand.
3988760	3991760	Not intuitively, I piss on his hand.
3993760	3995760	This weirdly brings the three of them together.
3995760	3997760	No, because that's a way to revive somebody
3997760	3999760	in the barbarian clans.
3999760	4001760	To pee on someone's hand was a great way
4001760	4003760	to bring them out of a stupor.
4003760	4005760	Was it a great way?
4005760	4007760	Sounds like the worst way.
4007760	4009760	It was the only way.
4009760	4011760	Okay.
4011760	4013760	All right, well, we should probably look through,
4013760	4015760	go up, he'll be here.
4015760	4017760	Yeah, I examine the statues.
4017760	4019760	Okay, so you examine the statues.
4019760	4021760	They're beginning to fall apart.
4021760	4023760	There's several cracks, and you can see
4023760	4025760	the faces are worn off.
4025760	4027760	Do you want to enter the room?
4027760	4029760	Yes, I enter the room.
4029760	4031760	You enter the room.
4031760	4033760	Hey, your pee kind of, like,
4033760	4035760	rubbed off the dick on his face?
4035760	4036760	Do you want to redraw it?
4036760	4038760	I go back in, and I re-ink the dick and balls
4038760	4040760	on his forehead.
4040760	4042760	Because it's going to be hilarious.
4042760	4044760	Would one of my sleep arrows
4044760	4046760	do the opposite?
4046760	4047760	Like Ritalin or something?
4047760	4048760	You don't know.
4048760	4050760	We should shoot him with it just to be safe.
4050760	4052760	Wait, you're going to shoot him with arrows?
4052760	4054760	With a sleep arrow.
4054760	4055760	Just to be safe.
4055760	4056760	Like a light switch.
4056760	4058760	I do my best to murmur things in my sleep
4058760	4060760	that make it clear I was bullied as a child.
4066760	4068760	And or molested.
4069760	4071760	Not another bath, mom.
4072760	4074760	I'm already clean.
4076760	4079760	You guys hear this and feel bad for your pranks.
4079760	4080760	How clean can you get?
4080760	4082760	I put on...
4083760	4086760	I feel dirtier after you clean me.
4086760	4088760	Can I put on my hat of disguise
4088760	4090760	and become Dan's mother?
4090760	4091760	Okay.
4095760	4096760	Okay.
4097760	4098760	It was bound to happen.
4098760	4101760	That's technically something that can happen, yes.
4101760	4103760	Well, I was just saying maybe it would wake them.
4103760	4104760	All right.
4104760	4105760	Did I do it?
4105760	4106760	Yeah.
4106760	4108760	Well, your disguise is what you think she looks like.
4108760	4109760	You don't actually know for sure.
4109760	4112760	That's just Sharpie without a beard.
4116760	4119760	What happened when he examined the statues?
4120760	4122760	I went back in to redraw the dick and balls,
4122760	4125760	but now I go back in while this is happening,
4125760	4128760	slightly creeped out by a woman in love with a man
4128760	4130760	pretending to be his mother while he's asleep.
4132760	4135760	Not creeped out enough to not pee on him.
4136760	4137760	No.
4137760	4138760	Okay.
4138760	4141760	I go into the room to look at the statues while that goes on.
4141760	4142760	Okay.
4142760	4143760	There's three statues.
4143760	4147760	A couple seem cowed in admiration or maybe subservience.
4147760	4150760	And the one is larger than the other two.
4150760	4152760	Its arms are stretched out in triumph.
4152760	4156760	And you can see words scrawled on the base of the statue,
4156760	4158760	but you can't really read their language.
4158760	4159760	I can read that language, right?
4159760	4160760	Supposedly.
4160760	4161760	I mean, you don't know.
4161760	4162760	All right.
4162760	4163760	Well, you haven't seen the writing, I guess.
4163760	4164760	Christopher, get in here.
4164760	4165760	Some writing you might like.
4165760	4166760	Oh, hey.
4166760	4167760	I'm a writer, you know.
4170760	4172760	I attempt to read the writing.
4172760	4174760	It says martial.
4175760	4176760	It says martial.
4178760	4179760	What does that mean?
4180760	4183760	You realize that it's part of the history of this plane.
4183760	4187760	Michelle is an ancient and dark god worshiped by the Yuan Ti.
4187760	4188760	We're fucked.
4190760	4193760	I kneel down next to Sharpie.
4194760	4195760	Oh, hi.
4197760	4198760	I'm clean.
4198760	4199760	I'm clean.
4203760	4206760	Becoming his oppressor is not going to help the situation.
4206760	4207760	I'm going to.
4207760	4208760	I'm going to undo it.
4208760	4209760	I'm going to do that.
4209760	4210760	All right.
4210760	4211760	Yeah, fix it.
4211760	4212760	Yeah.
4212760	4213760	Oh, hey.
4213760	4215760	Good job in that bath in there.
4216760	4217760	Good job.
4218760	4221760	I like like praising someone after they've been molested.
4222760	4224760	Took it like a champ.
4225760	4227760	Have you done this before?
4229760	4233760	I just wanted to let you know that what happened in there
4233760	4235760	doesn't make me love you anymore or less.
4235760	4237760	I just want to promise it's not going to happen again.
4239760	4242760	This one will impress you with my spells.
4243760	4244760	Oh, I know.
4245760	4246760	You know what?
4246760	4249760	I exist in every enemy that you encounter.
4250760	4253760	Any hole that's too dark.
4254760	4255760	Any.
4257760	4258760	I love my enemies.
4258760	4259760	I hate myself.
4260760	4261760	Oh, no.
4261760	4262760	No, no, no.
4262760	4265760	I want you to compartmentalize me, okay?
4266760	4268760	Compartmentalize all humanity.
4268760	4269760	Compartmentalize everyone.
4269760	4270760	Okay.
4270760	4272760	Just I'm letting you go.
4272760	4273760	No more feelings.
4274760	4275760	No.
4275760	4276760	Hey, not to butt in.
4276760	4278760	I don't think this is working.
4278760	4279760	Okay.
4280760	4281760	But keep trying.
4283760	4284760	Okay.
4284760	4285760	Magic, magic.
4285760	4288760	I don't think you should be so turned on right now.
4289760	4290760	Touch it.
4295760	4296760	Okay.
4296760	4297760	No.
4297760	4298760	No.
4298760	4301760	I awkwardly walk over to where he is.
4302760	4303760	It's dirty.
4303760	4304760	Clean it.
4305760	4306760	Okay.
4306760	4307760	It'll always be dirty.
4308760	4309760	Clean it.
4310760	4311760	Hey, what's going on?
4311760	4314760	You know, any positive feelings that you have about me,
4314760	4316760	I want you to transfer them to molarane.
4317760	4319760	And any negative feelings,
4319760	4324760	I want you to imagine them going into a dark devil's box.
4325760	4328760	Molarane's job is to clean my penis.
4328760	4332760	Not a vagina, just an actual box.
4333760	4336760	And imagine it being set on fire
4336760	4339760	and then being eaten by a monster,
4339760	4341760	and it goes away forever.
4341760	4342760	Women clean my penis.
4342760	4344760	Vaginas are on fire.
4345760	4346760	No.
4346760	4347760	Okay.
4347760	4349760	I take the hat off.
4349760	4350760	I take the hat off.
4351760	4353760	Hey, how did that go?
4355760	4357760	We'll find out when he wakes up.
4358760	4360760	I made some big mistakes, you guys.
4360760	4362760	I thought I understood Sharpie.
4362760	4363760	I don't think I do.
4363760	4364760	I'm very sorry.
4364760	4365760	I'm very sorry.
4365760	4367760	No one understands Sharpie.
4367760	4369760	He's a mysterious fellow, you know?
4369760	4370760	Yeah.
4370760	4371760	He means what.
4371760	4372760	He wants to help.
4372760	4374760	But for all of his gifts,
4374760	4376760	there's clearly a...
4376760	4379760	There's a deep pain that he masks.
4379760	4380760	Look, I've tried.
4380760	4383760	I've tried to clean that penis so many times.
4386760	4387760	Every time he falls asleep,
4387760	4388760	it has one of those dreams.
4388760	4389760	I'll clean it. I'll do it.
4389760	4392760	And I'm constantly just jerking him off while he sleeps.
4392760	4394760	And it never seems to get him...
4394760	4395760	It just makes it worse.
4395760	4396760	Never clean.
4396760	4397760	Never clean.
4397760	4398760	Okay, I'll be right over.
4398760	4399760	I'll be right over.
4399760	4401760	Maybe I should try it.
4401760	4403760	I've never cleaned this penis.
4404760	4407760	Can I give Chris my hat of disguise
4407760	4409760	so he can become Dan's mother?
4409760	4410760	Sure.
4410760	4412760	Maybe he should try a different disguise.
4412760	4414760	No, I think this is what's going on.
4414760	4415760	Okay.
4416760	4419760	I give Chris my hat of disguise.
4419760	4421760	Oh, hey, I'm back.
4421760	4425760	Never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight.
4425760	4428760	I've never seen you show me so bright.
4428760	4431760	You're amazing.
4431760	4433760	I look dirty.
4433760	4436760	Uh, hey, I don't want to do this.
4438760	4440760	It's fine. It's really fun.
4440760	4443760	I feel like I need a shower.
4444760	4448760	I grab whoever's near me in my dream
4448760	4450760	and hold them tight.
4450760	4451760	Uh...
4451760	4452760	It's Chris.
4452760	4454760	Oh, fuck.
4454760	4455760	Uh...
4455760	4457760	Chris, run!
4457760	4458760	Hey, dude.
4458760	4459760	Uh...
4459760	4460760	Uh...
4460760	4461760	Uh...
4461760	4463760	I stab his arm.
4465760	4467760	Do we need to roll a die or...
4467760	4468760	With a knife?
4468760	4469760	With a knife?
4469760	4470760	Well, but just very lightly.
4470760	4474760	Yeah, no, he's asleep, so it's not a task to hit him.
4474760	4475760	So I hit...
4475760	4476760	Yeah, you strike him. I'm sorry.
4476760	4477760	Yeah, you strike him.
4477760	4478760	Well, I'll just...
4478760	4480760	Yeah, but not to hurt him.
4480760	4481760	Yeah.
4481760	4482760	Okay, great.
4482760	4483760	You do four non-leastable damage.
4483760	4484760	No.
4484760	4485760	Uh...
4485760	4487760	Oh, that means you love me.
4488760	4490760	You wake up.
4490760	4491760	Now you're awake.
4491760	4492760	Oh, hey.
4492760	4493760	Oh, hey.
4495760	4498760	Did you, uh, have any weird dreams or anything?
4498760	4499760	Eh, the usual.
4499760	4500760	Okay.
4501760	4502760	You want to go out, uh...
4502760	4503760	Maybe, uh, just go freshen up.
4503760	4504760	There's a...
4504760	4505760	Do you want to take five?
4505760	4506760	There's a room with a mirror in there.
4506760	4507760	You guys didn't.
4507760	4508760	No, we'll do it.
4508760	4510760	No, you assholes.
4511760	4514760	I go and look at a reflective pool.
4514760	4516760	You have, like, swastikas and dicks.
4517760	4519760	That swastika's made of dicks?
4519760	4520760	Yeah.
4521760	4523760	You're in a right state.
4523760	4525760	I'm gonna keep these here forever.
4526760	4527760	That's the way.
4527760	4528760	Own it.
4528760	4531760	I want you to feel bad next time I'm saving your life.
4531760	4535760	It's gonna be a guy with dicks on his face that you drew.
4536760	4537760	They come off.
4538760	4541760	No, I'm making them permanent with a magic spell.
4542760	4544760	Looks like a magic marker?
4544760	4545760	Yeah.
4548760	4549760	Maybe a Sharpie?
4552760	4557760	I'm gonna make them magical through a special ritual called not bathing.
4559760	4562760	So we looked at the statues and it says that in those stairs that go upstairs, right?
4562760	4563760	Yeah, yeah.
4563760	4565760	But they have a giant crack in them.
4565760	4567760	So we can't jump over the crack?
4567760	4568760	Well, I mean...
4568760	4570760	You have rope, I guess, so you could probably...
4570760	4571760	Should we go up or we...
4571760	4572760	I have rope.
4572760	4573760	Okay, let's try it.
4573760	4574760	Use the rope.
4575760	4576760	I'll hold the rope.
4576760	4577760	I'll fasten the rope.
4577760	4578760	I take the rope.
4578760	4585760	We tie one end to Christoperg and I tie it around me and also fasten it to one of the statues,
4585760	4587760	the cowering one to the side.
4587760	4590760	And as an anchor point for the rope so we can walk up.
4590760	4593760	But if anything bad happens, Christoperg, I'll reel you back in.
4593760	4598760	As you tie the ropes, you feel a chill go over the room and you feel an odd presence.
4599760	4600760	You can hear a voice.
4600760	4601760	Oh, sorry.
4601760	4602760	Do you want to go?
4602760	4603760	No, go ahead.
4603760	4604760	Sorry, man.
4604760	4605760	No, it's fine.
4605760	4606760	It's fine.
4606760	4607760	You hear a voice echoing through the chamber.
4607760	4611760	What new morsels have been tossed into my cell?
4613760	4616760	You hear thudding footfalls and the clinking of metal rumbling against metal.
4616760	4617760	Luckily, you're...
4617760	4621760	Is that the guy from the Pepperidge Farm commercials?
4621760	4623760	Pepperidge Farm commercials.
4623760	4625760	Luckily, you're covered in piss.
4626760	4627760	That's true.
4627760	4634760	Out of the crack in the staircase protrudes a draconic head followed by a large green form that you know all too well.
4634760	4635760	A dragon.
4636760	4642760	Its toothy jaw opens in anticipation and bright green globs of saliva dripped onto the floor,
4642760	4644760	sizzling and bubbling on impact.
4644760	4649760	Its temples are crowned with a frilled hood that extends like a cobra's laterally down the body.
4649760	4654760	An odor of chlorine clings to its scaly hide and it glimmers with an emerald sheen.
4654760	4659760	Around its neck, you can see an iron collar and a few long chains dangling around as the beast moves.
4659760	4662760	Hey, how about you try going up first?
4663760	4664760	Well, yeah, he already came out.
4664760	4668760	I'd say get back here and let's regroup for a concerted attack here.
4669760	4670760	Is he within...
4670760	4672760	I get back with him.
4672760	4673760	Okay.
4673760	4674760	Is he within arrow shot?
4674760	4675760	He is, yeah.
4675760	4676760	Is he chained up?
4676760	4677760	He's got chains around him?
4677760	4681760	He has chains around his neck, but you can't see whether or not they're attached to anything at the moment.
4681760	4682760	Oh, okay.
4682760	4684760	I shoot two sleep arrows.
4685760	4686760	Two sleep arrows.
4686760	4688760	If he falls asleep, I'm gonna draw so many dicks on him.
4692760	4695760	One of the arrows strikes and hits him right in the neck.
4697760	4698760	He doesn't have any effect.
4698760	4699760	He stays awake.
4700760	4701760	I do a far sword attack.
4702760	4703760	Far sword attack.
4704760	4709760	Pulling your flaming greatsword from its sheath, you unfurl a far sword attack.
4709760	4714760	The streaking blade of wind goes awry and hits a wall or something.
4716760	4717760	It's wind.
4717760	4718760	You can't see what it, you know.
4718760	4719760	Yeah, yeah.
4719760	4720760	I gotcha.
4721760	4726760	Hey, Sharpie, should we look at this book and see maybe there's something in this book?
4726760	4727760	I think it might be.
4727760	4729760	That might be for another time.
4730760	4732760	I don't know if we have time to do that in combat.
4733760	4734760	Am I wrong about that?
4734760	4735760	We can't just hang out.
4736760	4737760	Okay.
4738760	4745760	He opens his mouth wickedly and sprays a corrosive green spray of acid, but you all manage to dive out of the way.
4746760	4750760	Is it possible for me to wear my hat of disguise and look like the dragon's mother?
4752760	4754760	It's limited to humanoid forms, so.
4755760	4756760	Okay.
4756760	4757760	No.
4758760	4759760	No being the answer there.
4760760	4761760	I have a disguise.
4761760	4762760	You dodged his breath weapon.
4762760	4763760	That sucks.
4763760	4764760	That's crazy.
4764760	4765760	You could've all died there.
4765760	4766760	Really?
4766760	4767760	Yeah, it's sad.
4767760	4768760	Why does that suck?
4768760	4769760	What kind of person are you?
4769760	4770760	I'm a sadistic person.
4771760	4773760	Hey, what's, I have a poison dagger.
4773760	4774760	Yeah, you do.
4774760	4775760	Can I throw it at him?
4775760	4776760	You can throw it at him.
4776760	4778760	You can stab him with it.
4778760	4781760	You can do other things.
4781760	4782760	What's stronger?
4783760	4786760	It would be stronger to strike him with it, but that would also, you know, you'd have to
4786760	4787760	be in range of him.
4787760	4788760	You don't want to get too close, Chris.
4788760	4789760	That's a dangerous prospect.
4790760	4791760	What do you guys think?
4791760	4792760	Should I throw it?
4792760	4793760	I think you should throw it.
4793760	4796760	I attach a rope to the dagger and throw it so I can get the dagger back.
4797760	4799760	Quickly tying a knot around the dagger.
4799760	4801760	You tie a knot around the dagger.
4802760	4803760	Is that my turn?
4803760	4804760	No.
4804760	4805760	Okay, now you throw it.
4805760	4809760	It only goes a pitiful like six or seven feet.
4809760	4811760	Also, the knot undoes itself.
4811760	4812760	I feel like the-
4812760	4818760	I feel like the pitiful was editorializing.
4818760	4819760	No, no, no.
4819760	4824760	You rolled a four on the tie rope to dagger and a three on the throw dagger to dragon.
4824760	4826760	So that's the dice.
4826760	4828760	How many dice do you have over there?
4828760	4830760	I got so many dice, man.
4831760	4832760	How many dice do you need?
4832760	4835760	Let me ask you something about my spell, reduced person.
4835760	4836760	Yeah.
4836760	4837760	Can I cast it on myself?
4837760	4838760	You can.
4838760	4841760	I think you already got that cast on you five minutes ago.
4843760	4846760	It was reduced self-esteem.
4847760	4849760	We did future damage.
4854760	4855760	I'm going to cast it on myself.
4855760	4860760	My plan is to get around behind his line of sight as a tiny thing,
4860760	4863760	so small that in the dragon's world, it's negligible.
4863760	4864760	Nice.
4864760	4867760	Well, then I'll remind you that you know it would shrink you down,
4867760	4870760	but only to about a little smaller than a quirk size.
4871760	4873760	Oh, just like a little guy.
4875760	4876760	What did you do?
4876760	4878760	You look like Willow.
4878760	4880760	All right, all right, okay.
4881760	4884760	Why don't you cast one of your crazy animal spells?
4884760	4887760	All right, I'll cast Summon Monster 2.
4887760	4889760	Summon Monster 2.
4889760	4890760	Okay, let's see here.
4890760	4893760	Celestial Giant Bee, Celestial Giant Bombardier Beetle,
4893760	4898760	Riding Dog, Eagle, Devil, Squid, Wolf, Monster, Sanito.
4899760	4905760	A monstrous scorpion, a fiendish shark, a monstrous spider, a fiendish snake.
4905760	4906760	I'm going to go with...
4906760	4908760	No, come on, guys.
4908760	4911760	No, no, no ironic monster summonings.
4911760	4915760	These are waterborne beasts that will simply lay there and die.
4916760	4920760	I summon the scorpion, the giant scorpion.
4920760	4926760	Summoning a giant scorpion with a snap and a swish, it appears.
4927760	4930760	Hey, could you have him pick up my knife on the way back?
4932760	4933760	On the way back.
4933760	4935760	It doesn't have to do it on the way back.
4935760	4936760	It awaits your orders.
4936760	4937760	Huh?
4937760	4938760	It awaits his orders.
4938760	4941760	Uh, attack the dragon. Will you, uh, Keith?
4943760	4945760	I grab the knife on the way back.
4945760	4948760	And see if you can grab Christopher's knife.
4948760	4951760	On the way back, you don't know how to do it on the way back.
4951760	4954760	On the way back from killing the dragon.
4954760	4958760	I take out my loot and I say, Keith, attack the dragon.
4958760	4961760	I go, fuck you all, I'm sorry.
4962760	4965760	With its wicked sting, the scorpion attempts to attract the dragon,
4965760	4969760	but it bats the sting aside with a flutter of its wing.
4970760	4972760	I fire two V arrows.
4972760	4973760	Two...
4973760	4977760	Spencer, for real, I'm really aiming this time.
4978760	4979760	Like right at his eyes.
4979760	4982760	Do I have to explain to you dice again?
4983760	4985760	Dungeon snap.
4985760	4986760	Dungeon snap.
4986760	4987760	Dungeon snap.
4987760	4988760	Spencer.
4988760	4990760	Well, that's probability. I mean, that's math.
4990760	4992760	No, I know. It's just the way you...
4992760	4994760	Well, that's why it was funny, I hope.
4994760	4995760	Yeah, totally.
4995760	4997760	They laughed, Spencer.
4997760	4998760	We're fine.
4998760	5000760	Keep on doing it.
5000760	5002760	Yeah, okay.
5002760	5005760	One of the arrows flies to the left and misses its mark,
5005760	5008760	but the other plants itself right in the dragon's chest.
5008760	5010760	Uh, how much damage does it deal?
5010760	5011760	Probably a lot.
5011760	5013760	So much damage.
5013760	5014760	Eight damage.
5014760	5015760	Ooh.
5015760	5018760	I take out my mysterious emerald dagger and I ask it for advice.
5018760	5019760	I didn't realize it talked.
5019760	5021760	Can I consult my dagger?
5021760	5022760	Yeah, man.
5022760	5025760	Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry to be a dick.
5025760	5028760	I, you know, I just like stabbing people.
5028760	5030760	Well, how do you feel about stabbing daggers?
5030760	5031760	I mean, dragons.
5031760	5032760	I can stab a dragon?
5032760	5033760	I mean, do you want me to stab that dragon?
5033760	5034760	How about this?
5034760	5036760	I'll go into a berserker rage
5036760	5041760	and you and we'll do some dual tag team dragon stabbing.
5041760	5043760	Hey, on the way back, could you pick up my...
5043760	5044760	Yes, yes.
5047760	5049760	Well, I'm going to be in a berserker rage.
5049760	5050760	You'll probably be the last guy you want.
5050760	5051760	On the way back.
5051760	5052760	You don't have to do it on the way down.
5052760	5054760	All right, okay, okay.
5054760	5055760	Sure.
5055760	5056760	Thanks.
5056760	5059760	Actually, before I do that, I just go over, pick up his dagger
5059760	5061760	and bring it back to Christopher.
5061760	5062760	Okay, but you can't attack now.
5062760	5063760	Oh, shit.
5063760	5064760	No, no.
5064760	5065760	Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Oh, wait.
5065760	5066760	All right.
5066760	5071760	Yeah, so me, sassy dagger and berserker rage dragon attack.
5071760	5075760	Flying into a berserker rage, you all but lose your consciousness
5075760	5078760	before you launch yourself directly into the clutches of the dragon.
5081760	5082760	Uh-oh, that's good.
5082760	5084760	Just some math here.
5084760	5087760	Yeah, yeah, no, you strike it right in the neck.
5090760	5093760	Scoring a seemingly deep slash on its flank,
5093760	5098760	you manage to deal not too much, you guys.
5098760	5099760	11 damage.
5099760	5100760	Oh, shit.
5100760	5101760	That's still pretty good.
5101760	5103760	Can I try to intimidate it?
5103760	5104760	I feel like I can intimidate.
5104760	5106760	You definitely can try to intimidate it.
5106760	5109760	What do you want to, what kind of thing do you just want to be like,
5109760	5111760	hey, hey, or do you want to like say something?
5114760	5117760	You know, you could have arguments or you could just make noise.
5117760	5119760	I mean, I could be like, hey, I had a song.
5119760	5121760	It was number one on the charts for him.
5123760	5125760	For a long time.
5125760	5127760	So, back off.
5127760	5129760	What's your intimidate score?
5129760	5131760	You know, on the skills?
5131760	5133760	It doesn't say anything.
5133760	5135760	Do you not have any ranks in it?
5135760	5136760	Well, it's checked.
5136760	5137760	Okay, it's checked.
5137760	5140760	So, then that's just your charisma modifier.
5141760	5145760	As I'm intimidating him, I sneakily grab my knife.
5146760	5149760	He seems to flinch back a bit as you intimidate him,
5149760	5151760	and you manage to grab your knife.
5154760	5155760	Is it possible?
5155760	5157760	I don't know dragons all that well.
5157760	5159760	Is it possible that he's being chained there
5159760	5161760	and he's been imprisoned by something?
5161760	5165760	What if we could use diplomacy to like, you're raging?
5165760	5166760	Oh, sorry.
5166760	5167760	Yeah, that's the thing.
5167760	5170760	Is it possible if we free him that maybe he would be like, cool?
5170760	5172760	Yeah, let's get a thorn out of his paw.
5172760	5173760	Yeah.
5173760	5174760	He attacked his ass.
5174760	5176760	Before he attacked you, I should mention.
5176760	5177760	Yeah.
5177760	5178760	Yeah.
5178760	5179760	I know.
5179760	5180760	Fuck this guy.
5180760	5181760	So, fuck him or...
5181760	5182760	I put it at Dan's turn.
5182760	5183760	Oh.
5183760	5186760	I have a thing in my inventory that says four paralyzers.
5186760	5187760	Yeah.
5187760	5188760	What are those?
5188760	5189760	Do you remember when you were in the Infinifish
5189760	5192760	and you went to the store, you bought some rope,
5192760	5194760	some potions, and some paralyzers?
5194760	5195760	Okay.
5195760	5196760	What about...
5196760	5199760	Those were syringes full of presumably paralyzers.
5199760	5200760	Okay.
5200760	5201760	Okay.
5201760	5202760	Okay.
5202760	5203760	Okay.
5203760	5204760	Okay.
5204760	5205760	Okay.
5205760	5206760	Okay.
5206760	5209760	Syringes full of presumably paralyzing fluid.
5209760	5210760	Okay.
5210760	5212760	Are they...
5212760	5215760	Do they come in ready injectable syringes?
5215760	5217760	They come in large syringes, yeah.
5217760	5219760	You can just buy that stuff?
5219760	5221760	That's like if you buy condoms and rope,
5221760	5224760	they should let you do that, right?
5224760	5227760	I give one to Christoperich because he has skills
5227760	5229760	that will enable him to get in close to this thing
5229760	5230760	that I don't have.
5230760	5231760	Yeah, I can sneak.
5231760	5233760	And I say, go stab this thing.
5233760	5234760	Cool.
5234760	5235760	This D word.
5235760	5237760	Can I use my sneaking?
5237760	5239760	I use my sneaking to go and stab him
5239760	5241760	with the paralyzer injection.
5241760	5243760	Okay, so you hand him the paralyzer
5243760	5245760	and you attempt to sneak.
5245760	5247760	Oh, hey, that's a good sneak.
5247760	5249760	You can't be seen.
5249760	5251760	You definitely can't be seen.
5251760	5253760	The dragon is occupied with quark right now
5253760	5257760	and attempts to attack him with a few of his limbs.
5257760	5260760	This could be dangerous, you guys.
5260760	5262760	Artificial tension.
5263760	5266760	That's a great filmmaking device.
5266760	5268760	The director should just come on and be like,
5268760	5270760	this is very scary.
5270760	5273760	It's called the M Night.
5275760	5278760	He strikes at you with his wings and his claws
5278760	5280760	and he manages to not hit you with those.
5280760	5283760	I mean, he doesn't manage to hit you with those.
5283760	5286760	But then he nips at you with his powerful beak.
5286760	5288760	He bites you right in the hand.
5288760	5291760	Not your dagger hand, of course.
5291760	5292760	Well, not of course.
5292760	5295760	I mean, that's a reasonable thing that could happen.
5296760	5298760	Dealing seven damage.
5298760	5301760	Ooh, my chances.
5304760	5306760	Yeah, so now you're sneaking.
5306760	5307760	Me?
5307760	5309760	Yeah, now you're sneaking.
5309760	5310760	Now you're nearby him.
5310760	5313760	You think you might be able to do something.
5313760	5316760	And as best as you can tell, he hasn't taken notice.
5316760	5318760	All right, I stab him with the paralyzer.
5318760	5320760	Where do you, like, in the face?
5320760	5322760	Right in the dick.
5322760	5323760	I'm sorry.
5323760	5324760	I'm sorry.
5324760	5325760	Where is it softest?
5325760	5326760	Eye?
5326760	5328760	I mean, the dick might be the softest part.
5328760	5330760	Depends how much he likes fighting.
5330760	5331760	Yeah, yeah.
5338760	5340760	What is your comedy team to call it?
5340760	5342760	Yeah, fighting dicks.
5345760	5347760	You stab him right in the dick with a paralyzer.
5348760	5350760	Now we're talking.
5351760	5356760	You guys, I stabbed him in the dick before depressing the plunger
5356760	5362760	and injecting it full of paralyzing fluids through the dick.
5364760	5366760	Take that!
5366760	5368760	His dick goes numb.
5370760	5371760	That's all?
5371760	5373760	Well, I mean, for right now.
5373760	5376760	You guys, I numbed his dick, so...
5376760	5378760	He's going to last a long time.
5378760	5381760	Well, now everyone's common fears.
5381760	5385760	If you have any formicide, I could maybe do that, too.
5385760	5388760	Why don't you buy him a Ferrari while you're at it?
5391760	5392760	So it didn't work?
5392760	5396760	Well, I mean, it hasn't completely taken, poisons take a while to work.
5396760	5397760	Oh, I see.
5397760	5401760	Let it circulate from his dick to his dragon brain.
5401760	5403760	Is it? Whose turn is that?
5403760	5405760	Aaron. Yeah, Aaron's.
5405760	5406760	Sorry, I'm just...
5406760	5407760	Oh, that's okay.
5407760	5411760	I shoot a single, and this is hard for me,
5411760	5417760	I shoot one arrow between his eyes.
5419760	5421760	Oh, hey, you hit him between his eyes.
5421760	5422760	All right.
5422760	5425760	Dealing some damage.
5425760	5427760	Dealing 11 damage.
5427760	5429760	All right.
5429760	5431760	Yeah, that's pretty good, you guys.
5431760	5433760	Now he has an arrow sticking out of his face.
5433760	5435760	And a big gash in his neck, right?
5435760	5437760	And a numb dick.
5437760	5439760	Ah, ah.
5439760	5441760	That's her state of affairs, yeah.
5441760	5445760	I was going to have to disguise myself as the sexiest dragon.
5445760	5447760	What about my scorpion? What's my scorpion doing?
5447760	5449760	You haven't given it orders, I guess.
5449760	5451760	You haven't attacked.
5451760	5454760	Wait, the scorpion's just been hanging out while this is going up?
5454760	5456760	Well, we're stabbing it in the dick.
5456760	5459760	Well, there's a giant scorpion just standing there,
5459760	5461760	waiting for orders.
5461760	5465760	The scorpion's still doing it with my last quarterly taxes.
5465760	5469760	He's like, this is not the best use of my talents, but okay.
5469760	5471760	I write off my mileage.
5474760	5477760	I tell Keith the scorpion to please attack the dragon for God's sakes.
5477760	5479760	What am I doing here?
5479760	5481760	He misses.
5481760	5483760	Keith.
5483760	5485760	He's rusty.
5485760	5487760	Yeah, he got cold.
5487760	5489760	If you weren't summoned, I'd fire you.
5489760	5492760	You had him on the bench for too long.
5492760	5496760	Keith's good at writing songs and making bracelets and stuff.
5496760	5498760	Just saying, then he's Keith.
5498760	5500760	Am I still in my berserker age?
5500760	5501760	Yeah.
5501760	5502760	Okay, then I go back for another sword attack.
5502760	5503760	Going.
5503760	5505760	Yeah, yeah, going.
5505760	5509760	I use my climbing ability to climb up to the tallest statue
5509760	5513760	and then leap at him to try to plunge my sword right in the top of the dragon's head.
5513760	5517760	Okay, well, that's going to be a climbing check.
5518760	5522760	In your barbarian rage, you can't figure out how to climb.
5522760	5524760	Shit.
5526760	5528760	What are you trying to do?
5528760	5530760	Let us help you.
5530760	5532760	What's your end game?
5532760	5535760	I'm so freaking out over here.
5535760	5537760	I can't climb the goddamn statue.
5537760	5544760	Everybody get on each other's shoulders and lift me up and put me on top of the statue.
5545760	5548760	It's hard to listen to what you're saying when you're just running against a wall.
5550760	5552760	So I'm still by the dragon, right?
5552760	5554760	I'm still up there with him and he hasn't seen me?
5554760	5557760	He's too numb in the dick.
5557760	5560760	Yeah, no, you really were hiding.
5560760	5561760	So good.
5561760	5562760	He doesn't see you.
5562760	5565760	Right now, he's actually occupied with Keith.
5565760	5566760	Who's, okay.
5566760	5569760	Can I toss Krista Berg a second paralyzer?
5569760	5571760	That'll be a bit tricky.
5572760	5575760	Can I throw him a rope and can he tie it?
5576760	5577760	No.
5577760	5578760	No?
5578760	5579760	All right.
5579760	5580760	You don't have like a...
5580760	5585760	Can I summon a second scorpion to make Keith feel like there's stakes?
5588760	5589760	I'm going to keep one.
5589760	5592760	Can I put on a hat in disguise and become Dan's mother again?
5592760	5594760	Yeah, you could.
5594760	5597760	And you could summon another scorpion if you wanted.
5597760	5598760	Yeah.
5598760	5602760	If I summon a second scorpion, I'm hoping that capitalism will emerge.
5603760	5605760	And you send him to attack, presumably?
5605760	5606760	Yes, of course.
5606760	5607760	What's his name?
5607760	5608760	David.
5608760	5610760	Keith and David.
5612760	5613760	Like Keith David?
5613760	5615760	Yes, that's right.
5615760	5616760	That's right.
5616760	5619760	As David critically strikes the dragon in the side of the head.
5619760	5621760	That's true.
5621760	5622760	I win the...
5622760	5623760	Sorry.
5623760	5625760	Dealing 12 damage.
5626760	5629760	Now that's how you scorpion, Keith.
5629760	5631760	Why can't you be more like David?
5631760	5633760	Keith looks dejected.
5635760	5637760	I have a red cap poison.
5637760	5639760	Can I stab the dragon with it?
5639760	5640760	Yeah, yeah.
5640760	5642760	So that's one of the poisons in your dagger.
5642760	5643760	Should I do that?
5643760	5644760	Yeah, if you want.
5644760	5645760	Okay.
5645760	5646760	Stab him.
5646760	5652760	You see, the dragon seems a bit less lucid, a bit loopy, if you will.
5652760	5654760	You stab him.
5654760	5659760	Your dagger manages to, you know, pierce its height, but only just a little.
5659760	5661760	It doesn't seem to have any effect.
5663760	5664760	You might want to, you know...
5664760	5665760	I mean, I don't...
5665760	5666760	You guys want to end it here.
5666760	5668760	It's going to take a while.
5668760	5670760	If you want.
5670760	5671760	How many...
5671760	5672760	Flip hanger?
5672760	5673760	I'm just saying.
5673760	5675760	Are we allowed to know how many power...
5675760	5677760	Like, how many power pellets?
5677760	5678760	Power pellets?
5678760	5679760	Energy.
5679760	5680760	What's his energy bar?
5680760	5681760	Health bar.
5681760	5682760	Is this dragon half dead?
5682760	5683760	Yeah, he's about half dead.
5683760	5684760	Okay.
5684760	5686760	Half dead cliffhanger!
5686760	5689760	Half dead dragon!
5692760	5694760	Thank you very much.
5694760	5696760	Spencer Critt, then everybody.
5696760	5698760	Aaron McGathey.
5698760	5700760	Camille Nantiani.
5706760	5708760	Half dead dragon.
5708760	5710760	I was kind of a half dead dragon tonight.
5710760	5713760	With my congestion and my inability to put thoughts together.
5713760	5715760	Are you going to go drinking afterwards, or are you going to call it a night?
5715760	5716760	I don't know.
5716760	5718760	Well, why stop now?
5718760	5719760	I don't know.
5719760	5720760	Yeah.
5720760	5722760	I feel like alcohol kills germs, right?
5722760	5728760	That's what they used to tell us when we first started drinking when we were 13.
5728760	5729760	Then we'd go...
5729760	5731760	If you had to share a glass at a party, they'd go,
5731760	5735760	alcohol kills all germs, bro.
5735760	5736760	That's what I heard.
5736760	5739760	I had never bothered to look into it past that.
5739760	5752760	Let's close the show with the greatest rap.
5752760	5753760	Oh, shit.
5753760	5754760	Really?
5754760	5756760	You feel like you've got this right now?
5756760	5757760	No.
5760760	5761760	All right.
5761760	5763760	You have a beat you want to do, or should I just throw one at you?
5763760	5765760	Just throw it at me.
5765760	5768760	You want sexy and slow or something more upbeat?
5768760	5772760	Give me sexy and slow.
5772760	5774760	What's on your mind right now before we start?
5774760	5775760	I don't know.
5775760	5778760	Failure?
5778760	5779760	Entropy.
5779760	5781760	Did you finish your script yet?
5781760	5782760	No.
5782760	5784760	How does that make you feel?
5784760	5785760	Bad.
5785760	5787760	When was it due?
5787760	5790760	January.
5790760	5794760	When do you think you'll turn it in?
5794760	5796760	May.
5799760	5800760	For real?
5800760	5801760	I don't know.
5801760	5802760	Is it any good?
5802760	5803760	Is it any good?
5803760	5804760	I don't know.
5804760	5806760	Honestly, what do you think right now?
5806760	5807760	I don't know.
5807760	5808760	I can't write.
5808760	5809760	I can't write anymore.
5809760	5811760	My brain is dead.
5811760	5815760	I used to have sparks connecting the little things.
5815760	5817760	I just don't have it anymore.
5817760	5818760	I got it.
5818760	5819760	Something left.
5819760	5822760	I angered it with my ego.
5822760	5825760	God left my body.
5825760	5830760	I used to hang out and do stuff through me.
5830760	5832760	Now I'm just an asshole hanging out.
5832760	5834760	Because you feel there's too much expectation.
5834760	5836760	You deserve it now.
5836760	5837760	It's easy.
5837760	5838760	You prove that you could do it.
5838760	5840760	So now all the apples are going to fall off.
5840760	5845760	Too much thought about me and what I am and what I'm supposed to be doing.
5845760	5847760	Too much thought about me writing.
5847760	5848760	I am writing.
5848760	5849760	I'm going to write something.
5849760	5850760	Me.
5850760	5852760	That's not how it's supposed to be.
5852760	5854760	How do you get back to the place where the universe moves through you?
5854760	5855760	You get destroyed.
5855760	5859760	You don't get handed a bunch of money by people.
5859760	5862760	You end up back in the gutter.
5862760	5863760	You hit rock bottom.
5863760	5865760	You become human again.
5865760	5868760	Are you semi-consciously sending yourself back to the gutter by doing this?
5868760	5869760	Is this self-annihilation?
5869760	5871760	Do you kind of achieve that?
5871760	5872760	Probably.
5872760	5875760	Mom.
5875760	5878760	Go to sleep?
5878760	5881760	All right.
5881760	5884760	Yeah.
5884760	5887760	Yeah.
5887760	5888760	Yeah.
5888760	5889760	Dig me.
5889760	5890760	Smooth rap.
5890760	5893760	Smooth rap from the heart and soul.
5893760	5896760	I got smooth rap not rock and roll.
5896760	5899760	I got a road runner going down the street.
5899760	5901760	I got a coyote chasing me.
5901760	5903760	Wants my meat.
5903760	5904760	His name is Money.
5904760	5906760	He wants to eat my ass.
5906760	5909760	I got the Howard Hessman at the head of the class.
5910760	5913760	Some rhymes come easier than others.
5913760	5916760	Got a retarded sister, got a dumbass brother.
5916760	5919760	I got two parents that live in Miami.
5919760	5921760	They're not in Miami.
5921760	5923760	I had a girlfriend named Tammy.
5923760	5927760	She had a mental breakdown after I fucked her.
5927760	5931760	Start over.
5931760	5932760	Give me a different beat.
5932760	5934760	I don't like that beat.
5934760	5936760	It's the beat's fault.
5937760	5940760	All right. Here we go. Yeah.
5940760	5942760	Oh, yeah.
5942760	5945760	That was the annihilation.
5945760	5946760	You just died.
5946760	5949760	So now the universe moved back through you again.
5949760	5951760	Yeah.
5951760	5954760	Sunshine raindrops and candy.
5954760	5957760	I fucked your mama like she was named Mandy.
5957760	5960760	I fucked your mama in the school and the gym.
5960760	5963760	I fucked your mama like the legend of Nim.
5963760	5965760	I fucked your mama like a mouse.
5965760	5968760	I fucked your mama in a two-story house.
5968760	5970760	I fucked your upstairs, downstairs.
5970760	5971760	Fucked her in the cellar.
5971760	5974760	Fucked your mama so hard she turned into a bank teller.
5974760	5976760	She said, withdraw no deposit.
5976760	5979760	Fucked your mama so hard I put her ass in the closet.
5979760	5981760	She was next to the broom.
5981760	5982760	She was next to the mop.
5982760	5985760	Fucked your mama so hard she started to slip,
5985760	5988760	slop down the street like pussy was wet.
5988760	5991760	I fucked your mama on a bet.
5991760	5992760	I lost it.
5992760	5994760	I didn't win.
5994760	5997760	I fucked your mama out, not in.
5997760	5998760	I fucked your mama.
5998760	6000760	Wait, give me a chance.
6000760	6002760	I fucked your mama, didn't take her to the dance.
6002760	6005760	I fucked your mama, made her feel real bad.
6005760	6008760	I fucked your mama, she's the best I ever had.
6008760	6010760	I compensated, tried to make her...
6010760	6012760	Oh, shit, sorry. Okay.
6012760	6013760	All right, all right.
6013760	6015760	Yeah, all right, okay.
6017760	6018760	Yeah.
6018760	6020760	This is a long track.
6020760	6021760	No, no, no.
6021760	6023760	Different beat, different beat.
6024760	6025760	All right.
6027760	6029760	I blame Jeff tonight.
6035760	6036760	There we go.
6036760	6037760	Yeah, all right.
6037760	6038760	Yeah, this is the one.
6038760	6039760	I feel this one.
6039760	6041760	You got lots of timings, but it's not gonna end.
6041760	6042760	Yo.
6042760	6043760	Yo.
6043760	6044760	Yo.
6044760	6045760	Yo.
6045760	6046760	Yo.
6046760	6047760	Yo.
6047760	6048760	Yo.
6048760	6050760	Sayin' nothin' but speakin' my mind.
6050760	6053760	I fucked your mama like a rabbit came up from behind.
6053760	6056760	I put my mouth on her neck, mounted her inside.
6056760	6061760	I put my lupine penis in her womb where I find my rabbit sperm.
6061760	6062760	My fertilizer, rabbit eggs,
6062760	6065760	made little rabbit babies that had rabbit legs
6065760	6068760	and they got eaten in a restaurant.
6068760	6070760	I fucked your mama's arm.
6070760	6074760	She didn't flaunt her meat on the menu.
6074760	6076760	I fucked your mama.
6076760	6079760	It's not tenuous.
6081760	6082760	Go on, Dan.
6082760	6083760	It's a very personal thing.
6083760	6084760	Don't deflect it.
6084760	6086760	Personal rap sittin' in bed.
6086760	6089760	I got stars on the ceiling dancin' over my head.
6089760	6092760	Your mama's uncle comes into my room.
6092760	6094760	He puts his hand on my thigh.
6094760	6096760	He says, shwoom.
6096760	6098760	It's what you should have, but you don't.
6098760	6100760	You shouldn't be a boy, you're a girl,
6100760	6102760	so I won't do too much,
6102760	6105760	but I'll put my dick in your mouth.
6105760	6108760	I grew up in the South.
6108760	6111760	This is all fake confession.
6111760	6113760	This is a fake Carmen Town session.
6113760	6114760	Make it real, make it real, man.
6114760	6117760	I'm trying to force with regression, but all right.
6117760	6118760	Maybe it's time for you to actually
6118760	6120760	physically experience a death on stage,
6120760	6122760	and then, you know, you could be born from...
6122760	6125760	Oh, yeah, that'll be up first.
6126760	6131760	Silence in the room, hanging weightless like in a womb.
6131760	6134760	Just gonna wait for the words to come.
6134760	6135760	I fucked your mama like a finger.
6135760	6137760	I fucked her like a thumb.
6137760	6140760	Hanging out in outer space.
6140760	6143760	I'm only thinking about class and race.
6143760	6145760	I'm floating through in the atmosphere.
6145760	6149760	I fucked your mama so hard, her eye went in her ear.
6149760	6152760	She looked like sloth from the goonies.
6152760	6154760	I fucked your mama.
6154760	6157760	She was a roomie of mine in college.
6157760	6158760	That was my knowledge.
6158760	6160760	I want to fuck her so hard.
6160760	6163760	I fucked shit.
6163760	6165760	Hold on.
6165760	6166760	Hold it.
6166760	6167760	Lost it.
6167760	6170760	Fucked your mama in the moment.
6170760	6171760	All right.
6171760	6172760	Wait, wait.
6172760	6173760	Hold it.
6173760	6174760	Hold it.
6174760	6175760	All right.
6175760	6178760	Shh, shh, shh.
6178760	6179760	Everybody, get those hands up.
6179760	6180760	Yeah.
6180760	6181760	Get them up.
6181760	6182760	Get them up.
6182760	6183760	Okay, here we go.
6183760	6184760	Feel the energy now, Dan.
6184760	6185760	All right.
6185760	6186760	Dan, look out.
6186760	6187760	Look out of the corner.
6187760	6188760	Okay, okay.
6188760	6189760	Yeah, there's like eight people.
6189760	6190760	All right.
6190760	6191760	Okay.
6191760	6192760	All right.
6192760	6193760	This is the best.
6193760	6194760	Yeah.
6195760	6196760	I don't have to do anything.
6196760	6200760	I'm just going to sit here and watch you do this.
6203760	6205760	What is this dance?
6208760	6209760	Feel it.
6209760	6212760	I have a heart attack.
6212760	6215760	This is humanity.
6215760	6217760	Look on it.
6217760	6218760	Accept it.
6218760	6223760	This is what you are underneath all your credit cards.
6223760	6226760	And your real estate deals.
6226760	6229760	This is what you look like.
6241760	6242760	All right.
6242760	6245760	Let's give you so much more real than I expected.
6245760	6248760	Cosmic journey through the light and dark.
6248760	6251760	Going out to make the truth stark.
6251760	6254760	Going past the stars and the planets.
6254760	6255760	I fucked your mom.
6266760	6268760	I got to figure out a way to end the show.
6270760	6272760	I got nowhere to be.
6273760	6274760	All right.
6274760	6275760	There's not going to be any.
6275760	6276760	Okay.
6276760	6277760	Space.
6277760	6278760	Time.
6279760	6280760	Lemon.
6280760	6281760	Lime.
6281760	6282760	Salt.
6283760	6284760	Pepper.
6284760	6286760	Cow.
6286760	6287760	Heifer.
6288760	6289760	North.
6289760	6290760	South.
6291760	6292760	Mama.
6292760	6293760	Mouth.
6294760	6295760	Eye.
6295760	6296760	Nose.
6297760	6298760	Flower.
6298760	6299760	Rose.
6300760	6301760	Garden.
6301760	6302760	Plant.
6303760	6304760	Mama.

6309760	6310760	Pussy.
6310760	6311760	Boom.
6311760	6312760	Gary Busey.
6314760	6315760	Gary Busey.
6317760	6318760	Give me a second.
6320760	6321760	It's like the master.
6321760	6322760	Remember the master?
6322760	6323760	Yeah.
6325760	6326760	All right.
6326760	6327760	Hold on.
6327760	6328760	Hold on.
6328760	6329760	Hold on.
6329760	6330760	Just let it go, man.
6330760	6331760	Let it all go.
6331760	6332760	Let it all go.
6332760	6333760	Do your little dance again.
6334760	6336760	Mystical.
6336760	6337760	Sorcerer.
6337760	6338760	Cauldron.
6338760	6339760	Witches.
6339760	6340760	Swords.
6340760	6341760	Fuck.
6341760	6342760	Fuck your mama.
6342760	6343760	No.
6343760	6344760	Okay.
6344760	6345760	Hold on.
6345760	6346760	Hold on.
6346760	6347760	Cauldron was a taffy.
6347760	6348760	Cauldron was a taffy.
6348760	6349760	It doesn't have to rhyme.
6349760	6350760	It doesn't have to rhyme, Jeff.
6350760	6351760	Buzz Aldrin?
6351760	6352760	He had all kinds of things.
6352760	6353760	Come on, jazz.
6354760	6355760	Sorry.
6358760	6359760	All right.
6359760	6360760	You can take this.
6360760	6361760	Start with a cauldron and buzz all around.
6361760	6362760	Mystical.
6363760	6364760	Moon.
6364760	6365760	Buzz Aldrin.
6365760	6367760	Astronauts in the spacesuits.
6367760	6368760	Rocket ships.
6368760	6372760	Fuck your mama so hard a tooth came through her upper lip.
6372760	6374760	Came down her throat.
6374760	6375760	Sperm went into her stomach.
6375760	6377760	Formed a big sperm moat.
6377760	6379760	There was a castle in the middle.
6379760	6380760	Fit as a fiddle.
6380760	6383760	Put waffles down there after they were on the griddle.
6383760	6386760	Said, hmm, bitch, I just made you a meal.
6386760	6388760	Then I fucked you from behind.
6388760	6389760	How's it feel?
6389760	6393760	Now, the food's going front and the dick's going back.
6393760	6396760	Come back to me for flapjacks at lunch.
