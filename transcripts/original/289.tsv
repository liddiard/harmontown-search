0	25200	Hello, how's it going everybody?
25200	37280	It's June 4th 2018, Harmontown is in a new venue at the beautiful Dynasty
37280	43640	typewriter at the Hayworth Theatre right here at MacArthur Park and the
43640	49680	prestigious prostitution district. I'm very very proud to be back and I'm more
49680	61040	proud to say out loud to all y'all Harmontown is now in session. Yeah, this
61040	65040	place is groovy. Speaking of groovy, let's bring out the Game Master Spencer
65040	67840	Crittenden.
79680	84800	And just to keep things consistent, how about a mayor up in this piece? Let's
84800	88360	welcome your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.
88360	100520	Yo yo yo yo yo yo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah yeah
100520	110620	yeah yeah but yeah yeah yeah hip hop H.I.P. H.O.P. to the H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu.
110620	116440	I'm gonna rap cuz that's what you do to me. You make me wanna rap free. I'm from
116440	121120	the streets but now I gotta pee in your mama's mouth. From the north and the south
121120	127520	in the east of the west under arrest. Rapping is pretty easy just like George
127520	133880	Le Guise. You just rhyme certain words that tend to come up like little turds.
133880	140000	The same words arrive when you're rapping live. You get some energy from the
140000	151280	crowd then you rap. Don't be loud! Thank you for setting me up for that. There's a
151280	158280	lower bar for what's funny now. Thank God we were eight months in a dark cave. I
158280	165400	didn't cut my hair or shave. I was a lonely sad curmudgeonly nave. I rapped a
165400	170680	lot about sadness. Now I'm back and talking about badness. I'm here at
170680	184240	Dynasty typewriter rapping bug pee. All right let's. Hello Los Angeles. I can't
184240	187360	make eye contact with you yet. Have you noticed I haven't made eye contact with
187360	191960	you? This feels right. This feels like a like a like an old-timey vaudeville
191960	196040	house meets movie theater meets like it's it's sexy in here. It smells like
196040	201800	popcorn. That's me. That's me. And I spent so long picking this shirt and then it was
201800	205800	like oh did this shirt go with the pant and then it just there was pizza
205800	211760	backstage and it's just there's just grease it just spots all over. You see
211760	214720	what your way of suddenly pointing out that you've lost quite a bit of weight
214720	227160	that happened. Yeah pizzas pizza stains is my way. Yeah well I mean that's about
227160	234240	it. I can't really there's nothing to talk about. Let's see. I guess I mean
234240	241200	here's a here's a here's a segment. A new segment it's called. Oh yeah our new
241200	249240	promise here at the at the new theater segments. Our research shows people like
249240	254760	segments. Yes. You're gonna be tired of segments before the show is over. Yeah. I
254760	263360	watch the Human Centipede trilogy. I know people people love segments. They're
263360	275160	gonna sew his ass to mouth. This segment is called. Who are you kidding? With Dan
275160	284800	Harmon. Who you kidding? This segment's about. Who you kidding? Do you think you're
284800	289600	kidding someone? When you say these things there's two things. They belong in the same
289600	296160	category. Who you kidding? Wait not to take away from how good that intro song
296160	301760	was. You couldn't see it but Brent Brandon Brandon Johnson just ran from
301760	308240	backstage up through the house with a piece of pizza in his hands like like one
308240	314360	of the boogens in a in a quiet place. He just like he he heard somebody yelling
314360	320600	outside and eating a baby. What did he why? He couldn't go around. There is there's no
320600	326720	around to go. Okay. People people think that Brandon is like we call him in when
326720	331000	you're out of town but Brandon's always with us. He's he haunts us like a little
331000	339540	pizza ghost. He's a pizza thief. Where were we? This is called. Who are you
339540	347340	kidding? Who you kidding? Okay so okay. I run the risk of please appreciate my
347340	352740	candor. I run the risk of offending a lot of close friends really when I say this
352740	362780	but like you know when you know that like I that anybody who is actively
362780	371900	working in the television or movie industry as a writer we know that you
371900	377580	don't really actually want to pick our brain. You want us to read your shitty
377580	382820	script. Like you you you want us to you want some it's not picking you pick your
382820	389140	brain like when you say I just want to pick your brain it that's not true you
389140	392100	know that's not what you want to do because that sounds that sounds fun like
392100	395860	you sounds like you want to like actually like oh I want to hear all
395860	399780	about like what you have to say but that's not really that's it never works
399780	405140	out that way. When you say pick your brain you mean I need something from you
405140	408460	I want something from you I want a favor from you that's a lunch that no one's
408460	413180	gonna show up for. Who are you kidding? Dan can I pick your brain for a second? I
413180	419100	have some dry cleaning and he picked up. I just want to pick your brain and it's
419100	422660	always like you go oh well did you want to pick my brain about well boy I'm in a
422660	427820	real pickle because I wrote this screenplay and I want to give it to
427820	432420	Roseanne but I also want to it's like there's no way what do you mean like you
432420	440100	just now's the perfect time yeah I don't know why Steve why she in my
440100	444740	iCloud well the reason she's in everyone's iCloud. Dan I can get you
444740	453220	Roseanne. She's working at competitive rates right now. I really got to
453220	455900	walk back I don't know if I've done it on this podcast but I got to walk back
455900	461300	like 20 years of basically going to bat for Roseanne and here's why because like
461300	466060	like I don't I mean there was a time when all she was was she was this
466060	474780	branded crazy lady with power and like I'm super woke and was back then and and
474780	478860	I had a I had a girlfriend at the time that was like a media studies like you
478860	482940	know analyst thingamabob and she you know I was having trouble with a
482940	486740	community and I would come home and like Tony doesn't get me and NBC you know
486740	490220	he's Ivy League guys and all the stuff and she's like you know Roseanne went
490220	493900	through what you're going through I kind of I kind of gobbled it up but it was
493900	496980	like oh really I thought Roseanne was a crazy lady and she's like well what do
496980	500540	what do you think women with power are called they're called crazy ladies by
500540	505140	the like old boys network and so I always you know that's that was like 15
505140	511060	that was a million years ago those eight years ago but like that whole time I've
511060	513980	always been like and then I heard they're rebooting the show and I'm like I
513980	519580	saw like the people being like oh let's we shouldn't do this stuff and I got to
519580	524020	say I was like you know to the extent that we have to like be accountable to
524020	528500	our tweets like our tweets mean anything but I did weigh in on the side of like
528500	532460	hey come on let's not overreact the what if it's like all the family like isn't
532460	536820	that gonna be therapeutic and wonderful and I had friendly anyways turns out

811940	815620	even believe in the segment that much I said that's the thing is that it's not
815620	819060	my fault that it's gonna be overloaded and then fall flat like who are you
819060	826140	kidding this is good this is good people like this who are you kidding when you
826140	831900	say these things are you kidding do you really think you're fooling people who
831900	835860	are you kidding with Dan Harmon who are you kidding with Dan Harmon all right so
835860	841260	I just want to say has anybody in the history of the entire species across the
841260	853340	whole planet has anybody ever ever achieved when being told to calm down
853340	861620	calmness is anybody ever been told to calm down and had as a result
861620	867420	calmness come over them it's never ever happened right and I'm gonna I'm gonna
867420	871620	I'm gonna wager this and I'm not gonna get hyperbolic I'm gonna cut it back to
871620	876660	90% I'm gonna say 90% of the people who say calm down are in a bit of an
876660	882460	agitated state but I'm allowing for 10% of like crazy circumstances where
882460	886620	there's like a paramedic who's genuinely trying to be helpful like calm down like
886620	893220	like you're dying like or your mom is like like like like like what do I do
893220	898660	mom like I got I got bit by a shark and I think if like if you're like a you're
898660	901540	training to be a fighter pilot and you're like one of those big simulators
901540	905820	and you start like oh you're crashing the things are happening and the guy
905820	910860	that's in the bush and the instructor says okay calm down calm down like like
911060	918180	this is advice yeah like like like take a chill the most irritating context of
918180	920820	it all is that because they listen to a lot of true crime shows it's just like
920820	928540	fucking 9-1-1 operators like I you'll calm down I died oh my god my baby's
928540	933740	been stabbed with a demon knife ma'am calm down like what are you talking
933740	938100	about like I it's just it's so crazy like they keep saying calm down and the
938100	942020	crazy the thing that drives me nuts about it is you if you listen to any
942020	946380	amount of true crime we all know what happens if you are calm when you call
946380	953040	9-1-1 you get thrown in prison for 20 years because they can't get past your
953040	959700	fucking weird tone on the 9-1-1 call oh it doesn't sound like his wife got
959700	965940	stabbed to me like yeah I'm fucking calm I'm so terrified of somebody I love
965940	970780	getting killed I'm gonna call 9-1-1 it's gonna be like you know like like
970780	975340	when I leave a store like I if I don't buy anything like I act like a shoplifter
975340	981740	cuz I'm like so anyways take it easy like like cuz I just feel like well you
981740	984340	should have bought something but I didn't so I guess I look like I'm
984340	988060	stealing something so I'll just lean up against the door and stretch and then
988060	992020	like you know like I don't want them to think I'm bolting and I look like I'm
992020	998140	stealing something I'm someone if you get stabbed I'm not you know and if I
998140	1003980	call up 9-1-1 dispatch and I say that there was a demon knife involved and the
1003980	1008460	person on the other end of the line's first question isn't about demon knives
1008460	1018100	then fuck them yeah man calm down calm down it's a demon knife Spencer what is
1018100	1026260	the what's critical on a demon knife 17 to 20 you're saying you saying on a
1026260	1033020	baby should be there should be there's got to be a better way I think what he's
1033020	1038020	saying is people who say calm down who are you kidding
1038020	1051860	who are you kidding who are you kidding oh do you have do you have another one
1051860	1058540	that no no that's a that's the segment but not long enough for you know you
1058540	1061340	were looking at your phone and you kind of you kind of phoned the other stuff
1061340	1066580	on my phone but it's like garbage but you know I so glad these comfortable
1066580	1079980	chairs made it all the way from Starbirds castle to downtown Los Angeles

1217980	1223340	warehouse but now we're in a proper theater and now we found out the showman
1223340	1233220	that Rob really is I've been hiding it pretty good Spencer Spencer is being
1233220	1246500	diminished by his table hey Robin Dan Robin I came up with a segment for the
1246500	1252940	show said that the cabinet back there that's called Rob's cabinet of whores
1263780	1270900	why did a guy leave a comment on my Instagram today I looked at or there's
1270900	1278660	one guy on my Instagram it said hey are you gonna address last week's show I
1278660	1286140	think you better go to the subreddit oh damn he went there holy shit what is he
1286140	1291460	doing first of all I happen to prove him wrong did not have to go to the
1291460	1298700	subreddit feel fine but what what did he mean what did you well you gotta go to
1298700	1306220	the subreddit if you want I don't gotta be a way around this there can't be
1306220	1309940	things that are only discussable and what you're doing right now is what they
1309940	1315220	call refusal of the call it's just this is a call to adventure that you are
1315220	1319620	choosing to refuse right now I'm not going on the subreddit I don't care how
1319620	1326100	cryptic you are hey Bitcoin rewards on the subreddit I'm not falling for it
1326100	1331660	anyways I don't know this isn't worth it it's not worth it this is a segment
1331660	1334380	called it's not worth it
1347900	1355540	it's just a waste of time cover your ears if you like entertainment I just
1356140	1362460	saw this paragraph I'm subscribed for some reason to this CNN newsletter and
1362460	1369900	Brian Brian Stelter Stelter he kind of does this little newsletter at the end
1369900	1376700	of the day and he's talking about the our missing first lady and but he kind
1376700	1380860	of interrupted himself because his little headline it's like in this
1380860	1388140	newsletter thing this story is a talker hmm let me fend off some of the
1388140	1393540	criticism I've already seen on social media well stop you there what are you
1393540	1400140	doing talker awarded I don't know what that means it's in quotes I think he's
1400140	1403180	gonna I think he's gonna define talker well he's gonna say people are talking
1403180	1406380	about it or he's saying this is one I talk and you don't get this story is a
1406380	1411100	talker let me fend off so it's like hey I'm CNN you should be paying attention
1411100	1416260	to me because I am the news anyways first lady's missing hey all right
1416260	1419700	before I continue with this let me just explain this isn't the kind of news you
1419700	1427580	get to complain about this is a talker let me fend off some of the criticism
1427580	1432700	I've already seen on social media no this is probably not the most important
1432700	1438140	story involving the trumps right now but it's a talker in a way that policy
1438140	1442340	debates and ethics scandals and abuse of power allegations are typically not
1442340	1452460	people are genuinely curious about this and concerned about her what you're CNN
1452460	1457740	what are you doing I mean wait that's that's more news that paragraph CNN
1457740	1461740	does anybody hear news worthy than does anybody hear the audience know that
1461740	1466580	term a talker and what that actually means I think he says he's indoctrinating
1466580	1474820	no the context is like it's a talker talking about it's like a squeaker yeah
1474820	1478380	but nobody but but he said the other things weren't talkers and those are
1478380	1481540	things that people are also talking about more than his yeah that was a
1481540	1488140	stupid thing to have said and he said but then then there's a second
1488140	1493340	paragraph it goes at the same time as I said on Sunday's reliable sources I
1493340	1497500	think there's a risk of some liberals falling into a conspiracy theory trap
1497500	1502060	here by assuming the worst about what's going on we need less speculating more
1502060	1505900	reporting right like no like less headlines saying that the first lady's
1505900	1521540	missing maybe a script about how dumb I am and I'll read the dumb like sorry CNN
1521540	1528380	like I feel like I owe this news and apology now just do what you think is
1528380	1533780	news and I'll watch you or not story about how we're paying attention to
1533780	1538780	Melania missing wrong yes yes we're not doing it the perfect way but but but
1538780	1542220	also don't choke down my throat for bringing it to you because this fucker's
1542220	1545900	a talker because he is doing it the perfect way and you need to just you
1545900	1549260	need to just listen it's a talker you need to take this shit to your water
1549260	1554940	cooler but when you do don't flip the fuck out you live times don't start
1554940	1559460	don't start going all crazy and we're in tinfoil hats about it we're just gonna
1559460	1566940	talk about it it's time to talker it's a talker I just I just I'm overwhelmed
1566940	1570300	exhausted with like I there's so much conversation cuz it comes up to me more
1570300	1575620	as a think piece this isn't a thinker it's not a thinker not a thinker this
1575620	1581020	is definitely that's what it is a talker you don't got to think about it you just
1581020	1587040	got to talk and talk and talk and talk I feel like I in this time of like more
1587040	1590880	information per second being more overwhelming and stuff like we're I feel
1590880	1595360	like there's an increasing amount of bandwidth being spent on us talking to
1595360	1599960	each other about how we should be perceiving right which is even extra
1599960	1608240	insane because the the it's like it's like it's what the objective information
1608240	1611920	would be the cure to all this like we could eat it's right within our grasp we
1611920	1616080	could be like oh let's just be objective because we're getting a little too
1616080	1619640	subjective but we don't want to do that so we're just like doubling down on the
1619640	1623800	subjectivity and we keep going like all right now don't start perceiving this
1623800	1627920	the wrong way and don't normalize this right tell me what to normalize you're
1627920	1634200	you're normal you're the TV telling me not to normalize this is crazy yeah it's
1634200	1637840	I don't know if tone policing is the right word but it's definitely like the
1637840	1641400	media being all like here's how you should think and it shouldn't be
1641400	1646360	critically of me yeah and it's like well that's what everyone bad does yeah
1646360	1650560	tone policing did we coin it well I don't I mean tone policing is its own
1650560	1654720	thing it's probably like a Venn diagram so I don't know it might be wrong to
1654720	1658000	label it but it sounds like it here to talk about that let's bring out Don
1658000	1666720	Lemon everybody Don Lemon I thought I thought you would talk to Brandon about

1832280	1835640	working with the wires I mean that's definitely a lot better scenario than we

1878800	1883040	of guns and how much they control
1883040	1890880	I'm mc gun control my bet is you can't tell which side I'm on
1898080	1909040	it's it's one of it's one of our shows few returned characters mc gun control
1909360	1917040	control the last two or three appearances have featured me explaining the joke
1921200	1930240	I'm mc gun control but you don't really know if I like guns or not oh shit
1930880	1936320	it's time to take a stand gun control take a stand now I'm sorry point left or right
1936320	1941120	up and down guns and no guns in our way I'll go away
1948640	1955440	because my name is gun control that is already implied I mentioned it was a poorly launched bet
1957600	1958880	it never made sense
1958880	1968720	you know one no one that's in favor of guns ever uses the phrase gun control
1974480	1980720	sorry what
1981760	1982720	oh

1993680	1994080	all right
1998080	2003760	he's against he's against gun control mc gun control is against he it seems like he
2003760	2011680	he dodges the issues so well I say his name should be mc gun awareness not mc gun control
2012480	2017040	gun awareness it would have been it would have been but I mean in my defense it was an organically
2017680	2024000	constructed bit I mean I don't I don't I don't sit at home in bed uh coming up with bits if I do
2024000	2031600	these tickets are 50 bucks like you're buying them you don't even you don't even care if you're

2493280	2497280	He's cured. He's cured. He went to therapy. He's cured.
2497280	2499280	I know it's really frustrating to feel out of control,
2499280	2501280	and like everyone's kind of disrespecting
2501280	2504280	the two very small things you're trying to do
2504280	2505280	over the course of two hours.
2505280	2507280	Oh, shit.
2507280	2509280	But I just want you to know
2509280	2513280	that the longer it takes to do these two little bits,
2513280	2515280	actually, the less we have to do.
2515280	2516280	I know. I know.
2516280	2519280	So it is. It is. It's awesome.
2519280	2522280	So, I mean, and don't get me wrong,
2522280	2524280	it's very comedic for you to be begrudging about this,
2524280	2526280	and don't lose that.
2526280	2528280	But what I'm saying is, this is great.
2528280	2531280	This is all great. Yeah.
2531280	2536280	Spencer, next week, please wear a black shirt.
2536280	2539280	And just do this.
2542280	2544280	Like the beginning of Zardar is just kind of,
2544280	2547280	oh, yeah, we'll put a little bit of pickle on you.
2547280	2548280	We have to get it.
2548280	2550280	We can chip in a little bit of our Harman channel money
2550280	2552280	and get a crystal ball on the fucking table.
2552280	2553280	Yeah, I know.
2553280	2556280	I slightly want him to become inside the crystal ball.
2556280	2558280	What if we got a green screen?
2558280	2560280	They just wear an all-green suit.
2560280	2562280	And so I'm just literally a floating head.
2562280	2564280	Yeah, you wouldn't even have to show up.
2564280	2566280	Yeah.
2566280	2572280	What if at the end of a 12-episode run here,
2572280	2574280	Spencer was like, I think this is my last episode.
2574280	2576280	I've done everything I want to do.
2576280	2579280	And then he got up, and under the table were 12 dead babies.
2580280	2589280	And then he had broken their necks for 90 minutes each.
2593280	2595280	And each one was a,
2595280	2600280	how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how.
2600280	2603280	Each one had a different zodiac sign.
2603280	2611280	So you went to therapy, and you're all better now.
2611280	2612280	No, no.
2612280	2614280	Well, are these mind blowers?
2614280	2616280	Did you, did you blow your therapist mind,
2616280	2619280	or did you get your mind blown by the therapist?
2619280	2620280	Mind blown.
2620280	2622280	Oh, oh, okay.
2622280	2623280	Okay.
2623280	2624280	We want to hear these.
2624280	2625280	Yeah.
2625280	2626280	Yeah.
2626280	2627280	So here's the.
2627280	2628280	How many do we have?
2628280	2630280	How many, how many, we can count this down.
2630280	2631280	How many?
2631280	2632280	Just one.
2632280	2635280	We can still count it down.
2635280	2641280	And now the top one mind blower from Dan's therapist,
2641280	2645280	starting at number one.
2645280	2651280	The concept of want versus willing.
2651280	2654280	Yeah.
2654280	2658280	So her example was, well, I want world peace.
2658280	2662280	I'm willing to be nice to dickheads today.
2662280	2665280	You know, like you, you can have an internal dialogue.
2665280	2667280	Like, what are you willing to do?
2667280	2670280	It's kind of, it's kind of blown my mind.
2670280	2672280	Like I, I've applied it to writing.
2672280	2679280	And I was, I was packing my stuff for a Palm Springs trip.
2679280	2680280	And I got out of the shower.
2680280	2681280	I looked at my toenails.
2681280	2684280	I was like, well, those could use a trim.
2684280	2686280	But what were you willing to do?
2686280	2689280	And then I was like, I was like, well, I'll probably put that off.
2689280	2690280	I'm going to pack later.
2690280	2691280	I'll pack last minute.
2691280	2693280	And then I'm going to be like rushing to clip my toenails.
2693280	2695280	And then I just, a voice in my head said,
2695280	2699280	are you willing to clip your toenails right now?
2699280	2701280	The answer was yes, of course.
2701280	2703280	Because it kind of forces a dialogue.
2703280	2705280	You're like, you kind of like high road yourself.
2705280	2707280	You're like, are you willing to clip your toenails?
2707280	2710280	What kind of villain says no?
2710280	2714280	No, I'm not willing to clip my toenails.
2715280	2719280	Well, then we're, we're at an impasse, as the French would say,
2719280	2722280	or as the British would call it, an impasse,
2722280	2726280	or as the Mexicans would call it, a regular standoff.
2731280	2733280	Can I ask a question?
2733280	2737280	I'm only upset with that joke that I didn't think of it first.
2740280	2742280	I have a question.
2743280	2745280	What is this internal voice?
2745280	2747280	Is it your voice, or is it somebody's voice?
2747280	2748280	George Carlin.
2748280	2749280	George Carlin.
2749280	2750280	That's great.
2750280	2751280	How'd you get that?
2751280	2752280	I've been trying.
2752280	2753280	That's amazing.
2753280	2754280	Oh, you don't have to pay for it.
2754280	2755280	Oh, okay.
2755280	2756280	It's a common creative license.
2756280	2757280	What do you call it?
2757280	2758280	Creative Commons license.
2758280	2762280	What if your internal voice sounded a little bit like Billy Idol?
2762280	2764280	What would that sound like?
2765280	2770280	Well, are you willing to clip your toenails?
2770280	2771280	Just like him.
2771280	2779280	With a screw in the shower and your Clinton two-nails with the blood on the
2780280	2781280	old yeah.
2781280	2782280	Hawaii.
2782280	2783280	Hawaii.
2783280	2784280	Wow.
2784280	2794280	I always forget he's a lawyer.
2794280	2796280	I think that's cool.
2796280	2800960	I always feel like my internal monologue is like,
2800960	2802560	oh, I want to do this and this and this.
2802560	2804560	And then I come up with a bunch of excuses.
2804560	2807360	But it's like, you can say you want all sorts of things
2807360	2809920	that you're never going to put forth any effort for.
2809920	2812440	But then you convince yourself that you are kind of,
2812440	2813480	but there's good reasons.
2813480	2815240	But being able to differentiate that
2815240	2817120	is like it's an important distinction.
2817120	2819880	Yeah, because it slows down time.
2819880	2823360	It's funny how procrastination moves at the speed of light.
2823360	2827280	You in one fell swoop will get an entire day's work
2827280	2831240	worth non-working done at the very top of the day
2831240	2835480	by simply going, what do I want to write a perfect script?
2835480	2837400	Well, that's not going to fucking happen today.
2837400	2839280	So nothing's going to happen today.
2839280	2842000	So instead, it's like, what are you willing to do?
2842000	2845040	Write 10 pages or write, like my thing
2845040	2849920	is I'm willing to write for four hours if it's easy.
2849920	2853040	Like I'm willing to not stop typing.
2853040	2854960	My therapist is like, slow down, Charlie.
2854960	2857520	I'm like, whoa, like racist.
2857520	2860200	And she was a nom.
2860200	2865880	And she's always, no, I'm like, no, you don't get it.
2865880	2868200	Like if I just fucking thought I could just type, type, type,
2868200	2871040	type, just spit in it, but it's like you're
2871040	2872360	trying to adapt Vonnegut.
2872360	2874320	It's like, oh, it's got to be good or something.
2874320	2876240	And it's like, then nothing's going to get done.
2876240	2877400	But what am I willing to do?
2877400	2880360	I'm willing to do a bad job adapting Vonnegut for four
2880360	2880840	hours.
2880840	2882680	And then I'm like, by the way, none of this
2882800	2884040	is applying to the Vonnegut thing.
2884040	2886440	I'm totally tanking it, eating, shitting the bed,
2886440	2887680	and about to get fired.
2887680	2889480	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2889480	2890480	Yeah.
2890480	2892880	Burp.
2892880	2894520	When is it due, Bonnie?
2894520	2896480	Like a week ago or tomorrow?
2896480	2897080	What's it due?
2897080	2901400	It was due like in 1997.
2901400	2904320	What are you going to do with that answer, Jeff?
2904320	2908800	What are you going to, what is that going to do for you?
2908800	2910680	How do you spell TMZ?
2910680	2912600	Are you texting Dan's Asian?
2912600	2914120	No, I know.
2914120	2915520	Church just texted me, and she goes,
2915520	2917440	they just found Melania two hours ago.
2917440	2918600	No, they found her.
2918600	2919760	Oh, my god.
2919760	2920560	Melania's recently.
2920560	2924240	Can we release the confetti?
2924240	2925960	I understand what you're talking about, Dan,
2925960	2928640	because I, for a while, love you.
2928640	2929640	Yeah!
2929640	2930640	Ah!
2930640	2933140	Ha, ha, ha!
2933140	2933640	Yes!
2940880	2943880	Finally!
2943880	2945080	This is all I wanted!
2949280	2952960	This is all I wanted for us to be on the same page.
2955840	2959600	Your teacher has become the student?
2959600	2962320	Can we get somebody from the stage check department
2962320	2965600	to spike with the tape where all of these tables are,
2965600	2966720	so it just never changes?
2966720	2969160	I want mini podium and a little pizza table.
2969160	2970360	I really do like this.
2970360	2970960	It's fun.
2970960	2972440	I like this stage arrangement.
2977800	2982120	Hey, do you think Spider-Man gets
2982120	2983920	bummed out when people call him Webhead?
2987000	2990280	I mean, it's been around for a while.
2990280	2992080	Doc Ock goes, Webhead?
2992080	2994280	Do you think he's like, it's not funny.
2994280	2996240	Stop it.
2996240	2997160	That'd make any sense.
2997160	2999000	Does he get pissed off?
2999000	3001080	Because they're not letting it go.
3001080	3003240	I mean, we can't tell if he's got the mask on,
3003240	3007720	but I bet he's a little like, I don't understand.
3007720	3009480	I have webs all over my body.
3009480	3011280	He's canonically hilarious.
3011280	3013520	That's like one of his big traits as Spider-Man.
3013520	3017840	He's like this fucking hilarious, wisecracking guy.
3017840	3020720	So he would be all like, yeah, no, that's hack.
3020720	3023120	But would he be all like, oh, yeah,
3023120	3024800	it's like someone using a shitty insult.
3024800	3025560	It has no power.
3025560	3027600	Or would it be like, come on, why is everyone
3027600	3030720	running with this?
3030720	3035920	This version of Spider-Man is kind of like, for better
3035920	3039880	or for worse, he's just Iron Man Jr. I watched the Homecoming
3039880	3044760	and it's like, oh, he's got his little Spider-Iron Man suit.
3044760	3047480	Oh, OK, he's a Spider-Iron Man now.
3047480	3048760	That's cool.
3048760	3050120	You haven't seen it?
3050120	3052480	No, the Iron Spider.
3052480	3054680	Excuse me.
3054680	3057880	Well, what have you seen in Havenzing?
3057880	3060000	I saw Spider-Man.
3060000	3063440	Rob, have you seen the quiet place, Rob, that you watched?
3063440	3064280	Yeah, yeah, I saw it.
3064280	3066360	Did you like those sound boogens?
3066360	3067680	I like sound boogens, yeah.
3067680	3069840	Sound boogens fucking come with you.
3069840	3071000	You got to like them sound boogens.
3071000	3071720	Have you seen that?
3071720	3073960	No, I haven't seen it, I haven't seen it, I haven't seen it.
3077400	3081520	Brandon, you got anything good in theaters right now?
3081520	3083160	God damn, you're so fucking high.
3083160	3085480	Look at this guy.
3085480	3088360	Who are you talking to?
3088360	3089360	Are you talking to me?
3089360	3092080	The thing is, if you've never told me, buddy,
3092080	3093840	you wear a suit like that and people think,
3093840	3095000	oh, the only reason you might be high
3095000	3097520	is you forgot to put a tie on tonight.
3097520	3099600	You wear a suit like that and people think
3099600	3103640	he shouldn't be sitting on a cooler with a pizza box as a table.
3106560	3108280	I will tell you that I got into a fight
3108280	3111280	with a guy who was drunk driving who ran me off the road
3111280	3112080	and I got out.
3112080	3112720	A fight.
3112760	3114760	And I got out of the car and I was like, I'll fuck you up.
3114760	3116040	And he was too drunk.
3116040	3118480	He got out of his truck and he was super drunk.
3118480	3120160	And I was like, that's not a fair fight.
3120160	3122160	You can't really.
3122160	3123000	The hand fell.
3123000	3124520	He's paying us all back tonight.
3124520	3125680	Thanks.
3125680	3127240	And he was like, I'll fuck you up.
3127240	3129400	And he was too drunk and I was like, that's not a fair fight.
3129400	3131400	I'm not going to punch this guy in the face.
3131400	3132760	And then I said to him, get the fuck out of here
3132760	3135280	because the cops are going to come and you're drunk
3135280	3137120	and I have on a suit.
3137120	3140760	And I was stoned out of my ass.
3140760	3144160	And it was so loud that when the cops rolled up,
3144160	3145200	it was so loud.
3145200	3146120	So high right now.
3146120	3147360	It was so loud.
3147360	3150160	And the cops came and I fucking walked over to the cops,
3150160	3154080	high as a kite, and was like, officer.
3154080	3157960	This man is inebriated.
3157960	3159120	When did this happen?
3159120	3159800	What did he say?
3159800	3161440	This was on the way here.
3161440	3161940	Whoa.
3166040	3167880	That's crazy.
3167880	3170120	Why are you getting into encounters
3170120	3172400	where you're saying, I'll fuck you up to people?
3172400	3173640	I'm always a little curious.
3173640	3175520	Brandon.
3175520	3176000	Brandon.
3176000	3177200	You want to get out of the car.
3177200	3178160	You want to get out of the car.
3178160	3179520	You want to see what's going on for a second.
3179520	3179960	Let's see.
3179960	3183200	Let's see how far it's going to go.
3183200	3184360	That's crazy.
3184360	3186320	All right, really, that took it out of me.
3186320	3187320	That's crazy.
3187320	3188480	We're the same age.
3188480	3190960	You can't fuck anybody up.
3190960	3195040	No, you're right.
3195040	3198800	Brandon can fuck anybody in this audience up.
3198840	3201920	I would never fuck anyone up in Harman town.
3201920	3203760	Yay.
3203760	3204600	Yay, applause.
3207400	3208400	There were no applause.
3208400	3208900	We loved that.
3208900	3210080	Now I change my mind.
3210080	3215080	After that lackluster applause, I'll be out front.
3215080	3217240	That's so crazy that happened today.
3217240	3218000	Give me my pizza.
3220840	3222000	Oh, ain't that a bitch?
3222000	3228960	Isn't that just a perfect metaphor?
3228960	3230840	We first sure talked about this.
3230840	3234520	The album cover for the Fat Boys album, where it's them
3234520	3236520	and they're opening a pizza box.
3236520	3239880	And inside the pizza box is the three fat boys
3239880	3245840	dressed as old-timey convicts stealing the giant Fat Boys
3245840	3248280	pizza.
3248280	3249560	Is it all you can eat?
3249560	3253800	Yeah, and they have ball and chains on them.
3253800	3255360	And they're like, whoa.
3255360	3257080	They're just eating.
3257080	3261800	It's like, oh, we're eating our own pizza.
3261800	3263720	We're eating us as pizza.
3263720	3266120	Are any of the Fat Boys still with us?
3266120	3268840	Are they all dead?
3268840	3269320	I don't know.
3269320	3270560	I don't think so.
3270560	3275800	Remember when the Fat Boys did the theme song to Nightmare
3275800	3277440	on Elm Street 4?
3277440	3278120	Yeah.
3278120	3282000	That's when it was really getting scary.
3282000	3285920	The music video where they're all walking up to the Elm
3285920	3290040	Street house going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
3290040	3292880	and then Freddy Krueger comes out, starts rapping.
3292880	3296080	You may be fat, but I've got knives.
3296080	3301520	You better start rapping for your lives, bitch.
3301520	3307200	And this was around the time when horror movies were really
3307200	3307920	getting it.
3307920	3311160	People were like, oh, we got to protect the children probably.
3311160	3314280	They're going to really start being mentally freaked out
3314280	3314760	by the end.
3314760	3315480	You're watching it.
3315480	3317680	It's like, this is ridiculous.
3317680	3322720	It's like, melted child molester with finger knives walking
3322720	3327800	around with these Fat Boys rapping about murdering
3327800	3329320	children.
3329320	3330480	Calm down.
3330480	3332600	Yeah, what's your problem with that?
3332600	3336920	Amazingly, that franchise survived the Fat Boys enough
3337520	3341440	to see the Will Smith, the DJ, DJ, Jazzy Jeff,
3341440	3344720	and the Fresh Prince did a nightmare on Elm Street.
3344720	3349160	Yeah, let me tell you about the time it was on Elm Street.
3349160	3351440	I was like, holy shit, this thing's bullet proof.
3351440	3354520	You can't fucking sell this thing out.
3354520	3357240	Freddy Krueger has more authenticity
3357240	3364480	to fucking unload than the executive branch.
3367920	3369480	Give it a look.
3369480	3370760	Go home tonight.
3370760	3375800	Check out the Fat Boys' Nightmare on Elm Street 4.
3375800	3380480	This was considered one of the best ones, two, out of the year.
3380480	3381520	Dream Warriors?
3381520	3383720	No, Dream Warriors is my favorite.
3383720	3384560	That's Dokken.
3384560	3385680	That's Dokken who does that.
3385680	3387080	Dokken.
3387080	3389560	Dokken fucking rolled it.
3389560	3392200	Kind of scary.
3392200	3394320	We went to see Dokken, and they did that song,
3394320	3396160	and we fucking shit our brains out on the floor.
3396160	3397640	I think they did the whole soundtrack.
3397640	3401960	They did everything, and we shit our brains out.
3401960	3404240	We saw Dokken live.
3404240	3405640	How long ago was this?
3405640	3406520	10 years ago?
3406520	3407520	It was at the House of Blues?
3407520	3408680	Easily 12 years ago.
3408680	3409680	Yeah.
3409680	3410480	House of Blues?
3410480	3411320	We shit everything.
3411320	3412720	They brought in Lynch, what's his name?
3412720	3415440	It was a George Lynch, the bass player, or no, guitar player.
3415440	3416760	And he came in, they used to hate each other,
3416760	3418560	and he got out there and did a guitar solo
3418560	3420560	that was a fucking, just a ball burner.
3420560	3421400	It was so good.
3421400	3422360	This is such a ball burner.
3422360	3424680	All right, all right.
3424680	3428560	Come on, keep this fucking sweet train and fucking steel
3428560	3429440	rails.
3429440	3431840	What about Bobby Brown's Ghostbusters 2 rap?
3431840	3434200	That one doesn't hold up.
3434200	3438160	Thank God for someone saying it.
3438160	3439600	It's 2018.
3439600	3441880	It's time to take control.
3441880	3443360	Let's get out of this, bitch.
3443360	3446280	You're totally sinking into this table.
3446280	3449000	Yeah, no, and it will continue.
3449000	3453840	I expect to, you know, it'll be above my neck level soon.
3453840	3455760	OK, name a movie that would never
3455760	3459160	have a crazy rap in its soundtrack.
3459160	3460240	Wild West.
3460240	3462040	Silkwood.
3462040	3464840	Schindler's List, yo.
3464840	3466360	Jumanji, Sophie's Choice.
3469040	3470080	The 14th?
3470080	3473360	I heard.
3473360	3476040	Silkwood.
3476040	3482160	Meryl Streep is a story about nuclear contamination and share.
3482160	3483960	Not Meryl Streep?
3483960	3484960	There's no Meryl Streep?
3484960	3486880	Yeah, I don't think she should be in anywhere.
3486880	3488360	Meryl Streep is such a good actress.
3488360	3491160	She plays Cher in that movie.
3491160	3494720	I said name a movie, and I heard like three movies
3494720	3496840	everyone knows that are all about the Holocaust,
3496840	3500280	and then like one that no one knows.
3500280	3504800	Let's give you a bit more of a lob.
3504800	3506000	What?
3506000	3511440	I haven't seen it, but OK, I'll do the Will Smith
3511680	3512880	rap about Quiet Place.
3512880	3515160	Zach, you got a beat for that?
3515160	3516640	Zach McKeever up at the beat house.
3519640	3525160	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, he doesn't do that.
3529680	3532640	Let me tell you about the time I was going outside
3532640	3535680	and I was trying to keep my mouth real wide.
3535680	3539400	But DJ Jazzy Jeff said, hey, Fresh Prince,
3539400	3542640	you better put that down, Clef.
3542640	3544160	Because we've got to be quiet.
3544160	3546560	Because there's Quiet Place.
3546560	3548200	This isn't going to work.
3548200	3549840	You can't improvise.
3549840	3552200	That's crazy to think you can improvise that.
3552200	3554240	You set up the bid, though.
3554240	3554760	I what?
3554760	3558600	I know I did, but my eyes were bigger than my talent.
3558600	3562600	I didn't, you know, that's because you
3562600	3564120	need to refrain even like, that's
3564120	3566400	how I knew I was in a quiet place.
3566400	3570880	You know, like, yeah, but it's all right.
3570880	3574080	Well, we took off our shoes, and we walked on some sand,
3574080	3576840	and we had to make sidewalks made of it across the land.
3576840	3579360	But DJ Jeff said, hey, Fresh Prince,
3579360	3582000	we got to not go over there and eat those mints.
3582000	3585080	But I said, OK, I think I'm allowed to do that.
3585080	3588240	But I did it, and I was real loud, smack.
3588240	3590280	And then the big boogens came out,
3590280	3593120	and that's how I wanted to have a quiet place.
3597240	3599240	Ha ha.
3599240	3604320	Yeah, thank you for your incredibly condescending,
3604320	3606280	polite applause.
3606280	3609160	It just goes to show you boogens just don't understand.
3613240	3615280	There's a million kinds of applause,
3615280	3621280	and that's the applause that was like, just finish.
3621280	3623200	Thank you for wrapping it up.
3623200	3624720	Hey, anybody see this?
3624720	3626840	Fuck you.
3626840	3630120	Anybody see this upgrade movie, this upgrade?
3630120	3631120	I hear it's pretty good.
3631120	3632880	It seems like a Shadow Run movie.
3632880	3634440	Seems like a Shadow Run.
3634440	3636160	Seems like a Shadow Run.
3636160	3637200	I remember Shadow Run.
3637200	3638080	Shadow Run.
3638080	3642520	You hear about this Shadow Run in the news lately?
3642520	3643320	Nope.
3643320	3644880	What is that?
3644880	3647720	No, it's like a weird cyberpunk role playing game.
3647720	3653200	No, but it does, though, because it's like we love.
3653200	3657800	That's the secret word today, role playing game.
3657800	3660160	But he gets wired reflexes.
3660160	3661840	I don't know, and then I don't know.
3661840	3663920	It just seemed very Shadow Running.
3663920	3666280	And guys' arm turns into a gun, like a bunch
3666280	3668360	of tropes from Shadow Runner hit in the trailer.
3668360	3670360	I was like, you want to go see it with me?
3670360	3672640	OK.
3672640	3674640	Do they have some of that cyberware?
3674640	3675600	Yeah, yeah, man.
3675600	3676920	Wetware.
3676920	3677800	That's all I got.
3677800	3678360	Sorry.
3678360	3680160	What were you guys going to talk about upgrade?
3680160	3681520	I didn't mean to hijack it.
3681640	3685480	I haven't seen it, but I heard people are really enjoying it.
3685480	3687280	They're really having a good time.
3687280	3688160	OK, I'll go.
3692640	3693200	Awesome.
3693200	3695040	That sounds great.
3695040	3696200	You should take him.
3696200	3697480	All right.
3697480	3698640	He's having a hard time.
3698640	3699480	You should take him.
3699480	3702560	Yeah, he's had a hard life.
3702560	3703280	Maybe not.
3703280	3705280	Maybe you shouldn't take him.
3705280	3708240	That's the basis you invite people to a movie on,
3708240	3709920	is whether or not they've had a hard life.
3709920	3710420	Seven.
3715800	3717040	The date when the people met you.
3717040	3718360	OK, let me tell you about the time.
3718360	3720800	We went to New York, and we had a ride with them.
3720800	3723360	My parents were gone, and we see the sights,
3723360	3725280	but then two planes came out of there.
3739920	3745840	We had a good run here.
3748840	3750600	Have you checked out the backstage?
3750600	3751640	The backstage is groovy.
3751640	3755960	Yeah, there's an upstairs like little fuck cubby hole.
3755960	3756960	Yeah.
3756960	3759320	There's like a little staircase you go up,
3759320	3761640	and there's a mattress with like pillows.
3761640	3764880	Ronald Coleman used to fuck Anton Lavey upstairs back
3764880	3765800	in the 1930s.
3770120	3773680	Hey, I Wikipedia'd this shit before I came here.
3773680	3777160	Here at the Telegraph sucker, what the fuck?
3777160	3778720	Dynasty typewriter.
3778720	3780480	Why is it called a typewriter?
3780480	3784280	You don't call a place a typewriter.
3784280	3789120	And I look, and the fact that everyone here likes it.
3789120	3790480	I like the name.
3790480	3793640	And if you need Jeff to like it, Jeff will like it.
3793640	3801360	I don't even get what that joke meant.
3801360	3804960	It's just all over your shit tonight.
3804960	3807360	Yeah, because you got on his shit last time.
3807360	3808240	I know, I love it.
3808240	3809320	See, I'm learning.
3809320	3809960	That's what I'm going to do.
3809960	3811880	I'm going to rip people's heads off once in a while.
3811880	3812360	Right.
3812360	3813120	It's good behavior.
3813120	3814040	It's been rewarded.
3814040	3815000	Great lesson.
3815000	3816440	You know, speaking of ripping people's heads off,
3816440	3817800	I thought of a segment we could play.
3817800	3819360	It's called D&D, motherfuckers.
3819360	3823040	Oh, yeah.
3823040	3826720	Oh, damn.
3826720	3827800	Shrob, you're staying.
3827800	3828720	Brandon, you're staying.
3828720	3830360	You can just chill if you want.
3830360	3833640	You don't have to stay, but we would love to have you up here.
3833640	3835520	It's been a long bloody time since we've
3835520	3839120	played our D&D campaign.
3839120	3843520	So we're going to need a good beefy recap on this one.
3843520	3844400	Sure, yeah.
3844400	3845480	Yeah.
3845480	3848520	Spencer, can you give me a nice beefy recap?
3850280	3852000	Yeah, yeah.
3852000	3855440	You know how I like my recaps.
3855440	3857960	Nice and beefy.
3857960	3862320	I want to get my beefy recap.
3862320	3866320	I want to take my beefy recap.
3866320	3872400	There's a town that you will go to, beefy recap.
3872400	3874440	Go to Tufo.
3874440	3878680	I want to get my beefy recap.
3878680	3882160	I want to get my beefy recap.
3882160	3882920	Nope, stop.
3886040	3887560	I won't.
3887560	3890760	It's not that kind of show.
3890760	3893560	It's the shit he drags in from Who's Line.
3897440	3899160	It's not going to be any clapping.
3899160	3899960	Yeah.
3899960	3902400	And we're finally under E, called Entertainments.
3902400	3904520	Ah, well, all right.
3904520	3905480	Fair enough.
3911480	3914480	You do you.
3914480	3916040	Go ahead, entertain people.
3916040	3917320	See where it gets you.
3922600	3926040	Was that referencing a certain other song, beefy recap?
3926040	3928480	I guess it was a little Electric Avenue, obviously.
3928480	3929360	Right, Brandon?
3929360	3931800	Yes.
3931800	3932760	Yes, it was.
3935520	3936960	Or no, Funky Town.
3936960	3939560	What was I thinking of?
3939560	3942040	Under this administration, I can only say yes.
3944880	3945920	Wait, what are you holding?
3945920	3946880	What are you holding?
3946880	3947640	I guess I'll like it.
3947640	3948240	Oh, it's a microphone.
3948240	3949000	OK, it's a microphone.
3949000	3950480	He scared me for a second.
3950480	3950980	Yeah.
3955880	3959800	Out in the street.
3959800	3961200	Out in the street.
3962200	3964640	Out in the street.
3967240	3970040	Oh, no.
3970040	3971440	Isn't that the lyrics to it?
3971440	3973600	Oh, no.
3973600	3978280	We're going to rock down to Electric Avenue.
3978280	3980200	Then we'll take it higher.
3980200	3986440	Look at this motherfucker clap, just out of, because he saw Jeff
3986440	3986920	sing.
3986920	3987720	Clap!
3992200	3993000	It's fucking good.
3993000	3993800	It's a good song.
3993800	3994520	Don't clap it.
3994520	3996160	Stop, you're clapping.
3996160	3998000	On the dark sides of town.
4003680	4008440	There is lots of work to be done.
4008440	4010920	Out in the street, there is violence.
4010920	4014200	There's something, something, something.
4014200	4017880	I'm trying to figure out how to ruin their clapping.
4017880	4025080	I want to make them party to something awful, like a clap
4025080	4028680	if you eat babies.
4028680	4030920	Yeah, they love it.
4030920	4034320	Because I picked a safe form of causticity.
4034320	4035480	What if I went there?
4035480	4036640	You would have been fucked up.
4039440	4040440	What have you been up to?
4040440	4041480	Let's get ready to DMP.
4041480	4042760	What have I been up to?
4042760	4044840	What have you been up to lately, Evan?
4044840	4047840	I haven't, you know, I'm just trying to write this thing.
4048800	4051680	I've been canceling every appointment I've ever had,
4051680	4053760	and I'm trying to finish this thing,
4053760	4056640	and I can't finish it, and I'm supposed to finish it,
4056640	4058200	and it's supposed to be done, and I'm trying to finish it.
4058200	4059200	You should finish it.
4059200	4059840	Yeah.
4059840	4060800	You know what?
4060800	4062360	Great idea.
4062360	4065360	Do you want 5%?
4065360	4066960	No, I just want you to be happy.
4066960	4067640	OK.
4067640	4069520	Well, see?
4069520	4070000	See?
4070000	4078720	That's how I go to Boston.
4084240	4085920	Let's get Steve Levy up here, everybody.
4085920	4086640	Steve Levy.
4093640	4097080	Hey, before we do D&D, Spencer, do
4097080	4100800	we want to talk about the altercation that we saw today?
4100800	4101800	Sure, yeah.
4101800	4106120	So I was leaving Little Doms today.
4106120	4110800	You were leaving Little Doms, and there was three dudes,
4110800	4114920	and they were following, there were three white dudes,
4114920	4117320	and they were following a black guy without a shirt who
4117320	4120080	had long dreadlocks who was walking his bicycle,
4120080	4122960	and they were following him and having a moving argument.
4122960	4124080	Oh, Tommy.
4124080	4126240	Yeah.
4127240	4129680	So I didn't know what the situation was,
4129680	4132600	but it's always, I had listened to a podcast where
4132600	4135800	someone watched as five people just beat the shit
4135800	4139200	unmercilously out of this guy, and it was just horrible.
4139200	4141640	And so I was like, I don't want to see three guys kick
4141640	4142920	the shit out of some guy.
4142920	4147480	So I walked over there, and they were yelling and escalating,
4147480	4149200	and I didn't get there until they actually
4149200	4150520	started punching and stuff.
4150520	4152960	But everyone was kind of gathering and watching.
4152960	4154520	They were throwing coffee at each other.
4154520	4156880	Yeah, they were knocking each other's drinks.
4156880	4159840	I think the initial altercation happened at the coffee bean,
4159840	4162160	and then someone knocked a drink out of someone's hand,
4162160	4164560	and then it moved outside, and the cops were called.
4164560	4165060	I don't know.
4165060	4168760	Anyway, I get there, and then they're engaged,
4168760	4171360	and so I just get as close as I can.
4171360	4173560	Oh, well, that's a nuptial spat.
4173560	4174640	Oh, God.
4174640	4175480	Oh, Jesus.
4175480	4177520	What do you mean?
4177520	4181440	Wait, so this fight was a three on one?
4181440	4182680	Well, that's the thing.
4182760	4185560	It didn't start as a fight, but the three guys
4185560	4188480	were clearly harassing and threatening the guy
4188480	4189680	to make him feel uncomfortable.
4189680	4192020	And he was like, I took you guys.
4192020	4194840	I took both of your asses on earlier, and I won.
4194840	4197640	And then so then the guy was like, come at me.
4197640	4201320	And then they were trying to two at one, go out.
4201320	4204840	Not like tag team, but kind of be ready to catch them
4204840	4206120	off guard and stuff.
4206120	4208840	And so that was about when I got there.
4208840	4210080	There was a lot of dodging and stuff.
4210080	4212240	Maybe about three or four punches had been thrown.
4212320	4214880	But then I just get up in one of the guys,
4214880	4216800	right behind the guy, and then I'm like, hey,
4216800	4218120	can we stop fighting?
4218120	4219200	Please stop fighting.
4219200	4221400	Can we not stop fighting?
4221400	4222420	Can you stop fighting?
4222420	4223440	Stop fighting.
4223440	4226120	And then they're like, oh, no, you got witnesses here.
4226120	4227120	Knock it off, man.
4227120	4227880	We're the victims.
4227880	4228440	He sees it.
4228440	4229600	I'm like, you guys are idiots.
4229600	4230100	Just stop.
4230100	4230600	Come on.
4230600	4231320	Knock it off.
4231320	4233080	And then he's like, no, this guy's wrong.
4233080	4235880	And I'm like, you're all wrong.
4235880	4238160	And then I heard sirens, and so I walked away
4238160	4240360	because they weren't actively looking
4240360	4242120	to get in a punch at that point because I
4242240	4242760	don't know.
4242760	4245680	The thing is, you get worked up into this spell of violence
4245680	4246320	and rage.
4246320	4248560	And it's very easy to break it.
4248560	4251480	But you don't see anything outside of that bubble
4251480	4252240	when you're in it.
4252240	4254720	So I feel like I just distracted them enough.
4254720	4256480	And then, yeah, I heard the sirens,
4256480	4257640	and I started walking away.
4257640	4260920	And then a police guy pulled a big U-turn and stopped them.
4260920	4265040	And the black guy, he ran to the police and was like,
4265040	4265640	help me out.
4265640	4267480	And then I was like, I'm out.
4267480	4270440	I don't want to answer any questions.
4270440	4274960	And when the police started to beat him, he said that to me.
4274960	4276240	That was definitely my worry.
4276240	4279360	He strove him to the ground and handcuffed him.
4279360	4281480	He seemed willing to go to the police.
4281480	4282880	And so I was like, well, the police
4282880	4284200	were really in trouble.
4284200	4285840	When the police show up and there's a black guy there,
4285840	4289960	that's a great time for all the witnesses just to scatter.
4289960	4291400	There was a lot of witnesses.
4291400	4293760	There was just no one who was breaking up the fight.
4293760	4297920	What Spencer didn't know is that I was in the optometrist,
4297920	4299600	where this was all happening.
4300600	4303120	And the fight was happening in the front window,
4303120	4306320	where everybody in the optometry building
4306320	4310720	was looking out the window, going, oh, like, opening up
4310720	4312320	the door, like, a half.
4312320	4313080	What's happening?
4313080	4318120	A half inch going, going, hey, stop, stop fighting.
4318120	4320160	Stop fighting, stop fighting, yeah.
4320160	4323120	And me and Randall Park's brother are sitting there, going, dude,
4323120	4323840	what's going on?
4323840	4324680	We should do something.
4324680	4327240	Yeah, we should probably do something.
4327240	4329200	Isn't that Spencer?
4329200	4331040	He's about to cross the street.
4331040	4334560	Yeah, he looks like he's about to cross the street.
4334560	4338160	Meanwhile, I was like, I'm going to fuck you up.
4338160	4341040	So I watched, and Spencer had no idea
4341040	4342960	that I was living in his world.
4342960	4344280	I didn't want to say one thing.
4344280	4346400	The only thing is when you were telling this story
4346400	4349080	and you were narrating for the guy who said, like, hey, I
4349080	4353960	took, I thought you were going to say, hey, I took two of you
4353960	4356800	guys out for coffee.
4356800	4359600	This isn't how I pictured this afternoon going.
4362760	4364400	And then the third guy's like, well, you
4364400	4367120	should have gone with my bid.
4367120	4368320	They're all architects.
4368320	4371840	All right, Spencer, do you think you can recap what,
4371840	4374560	like, D&D from years gone by?
4374560	4377600	Oh, yeah.
4377600	4381280	You guys down for that at all?
4381280	4385360	No, no.
4385360	4386560	I heard one voice of descent.
4389560	4391240	Wait, where is the music?
4391240	4393400	Spencer, you want some music for this?
4393400	4394880	Or do you want to do it in archipelago?
4394880	4397920	I don't care, man.
4397920	4399960	Come on, hero.
4399960	4403040	Come on, hero.
4403040	4405040	Let's get some fucking music.
4405040	4407000	I'm glad, too.
4407000	4408520	Yeah.
4408520	4409760	Yeah, D&D.
4409760	4410880	There's an audience here.
4410880	4413000	D&D, yeah.
4413000	4415400	Yeah, drop D&D.
4415400	4416520	Do it good, son.
4416520	4418000	I'll fuck you up.
4418000	4419320	Rob you, bro.
4419320	4420080	D&D.
4420080	4421280	I'll rob you.
4421280	4424000	Let's get on this roller coaster.
4424000	4427680	Go to another dimension.
4427680	4435040	All right, so the gang was on a mission to find Patchen's gem.
4435040	4438680	They were searching around, and they were finding some clues.
4438680	4440920	They kidnapped a guy to get more clues,
4440920	4444360	but they didn't really find any clues from that guy.
4444360	4446440	And then, what's his name?
4446440	4451400	Diarrhea Jr. He started snooping around on his loan,
4451400	4453040	but he got in over his head.
4453040	4456920	And before he knew it, he was kidnapped and locked somewhere.
4456920	4460560	So our heroes went to save him, and they found him.
4463400	4464920	Did something happen?
4464920	4467400	OK, they found him, and it was fun.
4467400	4469080	But they had to fight.
4469080	4470440	There was a fight.
4471440	4473080	They were fighting.
4473080	4476120	They're still fighting.
4476120	4481600	They got to save DJ from the Evil Actors Guild.
4485400	4489120	Now, on Harmon Town.
4489120	4489600	All right.
4493880	4495960	I'd like to pretend I heard more of that than I did,
4495960	4497800	because I was handing out the character sheets,
4497800	4499120	but I think I'll be all right.
4499280	4501800	Oh, were you forced to do that?
4501800	4503240	I should have done it earlier.
4503240	4505720	I did not manage my time well.
4505720	4506480	I'm excited.
4506480	4509400	This is the first time ever I have my own sheet.
4509400	4512200	Yeah, you want to read off some fast facts?
4512200	4515440	Steve Levy or whatever.
4515440	4517400	You know, I feel like he never asked me for it.
4517400	4519120	I would have definitely complied with that.
4519120	4523240	I like to say I'm an easygoing person, I think.
4523240	4525760	I want everyone to feel included.
4525760	4528600	D&D beef.
4528680	4531680	D&D beef.
4531680	4535240	You guys, you're in a fight.
4535240	4539480	You're in the underground area of the theater house
4539480	4542040	of the Screen Actors Guild.
4542040	4545240	No, what was it?
4545240	4549360	It was a guild of acting people.
4549360	4550400	And you're down there.
4550400	4554400	It's like a wooden, what do you call it, like a break room.
4554400	4557400	There's tables and chairs, and you see a dartboard on the wall,
4557400	4559360	and there's a map on the wall.
4559360	4561520	You were fighting, and you seem to have
4561520	4563000	killed two of these guys.
4563000	4568240	The only one who's left is a dude holding a gun.
4568240	4569440	It's like a lightning gun.
4569440	4572040	It shoots lightning, and he shot you with lightning before.
4572040	4574920	Shit, oh yeah, that's right, the lightning gun.
4574920	4578320	Isn't everybody entangled in a tree thing?
4578320	4582800	Right, thank you for bringing that up.
4582800	4586200	Jeff turned into a tree, and then he entangled everybody.
4586200	4586800	Oh, that's right.
4586880	4588880	Yeah, I remember that.
4588880	4590520	I was there for that.
4590520	4593040	Yeah, yeah.
4593040	4595240	I'm used to having a table.
4595240	4595880	It's nice, huh?
4595880	4599200	Can I do a good old-fashioned observe surrounding
4599200	4601440	and see who's where and what's what?
4601440	4605040	Yeah, so there's two corpses on the ground,
4605040	4609200	and then there's one guy who's kind of entangled in your tree.
4609200	4613040	That's you, and he's not super entangled.
4613040	4617200	He's like wrestling with vines and such.
4617200	4619760	Then there's everyone else.
4619760	4622920	Yeah, there's actually three doors,
4622920	4625640	and like I said, some tables, chairs, a dartboard.
4625640	4626920	These fucking glasses.
4626920	4629960	So combat is still happening right now.
4629960	4630680	Oh, yeah.
4630680	4633480	All right, so who has the initiative?
4633480	4634040	He does.
4634040	4635440	He shoots you with a gun.
4635440	4636080	Me?
4636080	4636560	Yeah.
4636560	4637080	What?
4637080	4639320	That's just a tree.
4639320	4640560	But you entangled him.
4640560	4643000	Well, it's a tree.
4643000	4645640	All right, it's hard to dodge as a tree.
4645640	4647240	Oh, no, but you're immune to lightning.
4647240	4653360	OK, so we established that.
4653360	4656520	Wait, wait, do trees get hit by lightning all the time, though?
4656520	4658480	Yeah.
4658480	4661840	Because I have my fire abilities, maybe?
4661840	4663280	Is that why?
4663280	4664360	Is that my character?
4664360	4665360	Nah.
4665360	4668320	OK, hey, look, trees have resistance electricity.
4668320	4669560	They're not immune.
4669560	4672400	OK, all right, so I dodged it?
4672400	4674920	No, you're a tree.
4674920	4676600	But I absorb it because I'm immune.
4676600	4677400	Yes, yes, sorry.
4677400	4680280	I'm not going to question you ever again.
4680280	4680880	Thank you.
4680880	4682120	That's all I've ever wanted.
4685200	4686520	Does anyone else want to play?
4690520	4692280	How do I have him entangled?
4692280	4696200	Like, where are my branches around him?
4696200	4697600	They're mostly around his ankles.
4697600	4699000	Like, his arms are unencumbered,
4699000	4700440	and that's why he could shoot you with a gun.
4700440	4702960	I pick him up by the ankles and hold him upside down
4702960	4707040	like a pinata so that the rest of the squad can come attack.
4707040	4708200	All right, you do that.
4708200	4710160	Yes, I fucking do.
4710160	4714280	Am I entangled in his trees, Francis?
4714280	4715440	Yeah, currently.
4715440	4719040	Hey, is he shooting lightning?
4719040	4720360	He did.
4720360	4720880	OK.
4724360	4726600	Did you have a question?
4726600	4728360	No, let me know when he does again.
4728360	4729960	OK, all right.
4730720	4731600	I want to do something.
4731600	4732920	Do you want to prepare something?
4735720	4736320	Yeah.
4736320	4737320	What do you want to prepare?
4737320	4739800	I want to prepare jumping in front of the lightning.
4739800	4740480	OK, great.
4740480	4741120	You do that.
4741120	4743200	Perfect.
4743200	4746000	Can I shimmy out of the branches?
4746000	4747440	Yeah, do you want to try?
4747440	4747960	Yeah.
4747960	4750160	Do you have a escape artist or anything?
4750160	4750760	It's a escape.
4750760	4751480	You can escape now.
4751480	4752480	I don't have escape.
4752480	4753760	All right, give me your decks.
4757520	4758440	All right.
4758440	4759320	You don't escape.
4762320	4763800	You really got to be tangled here.
4763800	4767560	You can move your arms, but you can't move very easily.
4767560	4769160	Can't I just choose to let him free?
4769160	4772440	Or is this like I don't have any control over my entanglement?
4772440	4774520	You do on your turn.
4774520	4776200	OK.
4776200	4777040	Sorry, diary.
4777040	4780360	I should have used my first turn to let you get free.
4780360	4780920	It's cool.
4780920	4783000	I'll just chill here in your branches.
4783000	4784440	All right.
4784440	4785640	You're like, Jeff, let me go.
4788760	4791520	Yeah, I'm like, my name is Chad.
4791520	4792800	Let me go.
4792800	4794000	I'm stuck in your branches.
4794000	4794960	What the fuck?
4794960	4797000	Let me go.
4797000	4799000	And then a bear walks through the frame.
4804920	4805840	You all see that bear?
4809160	4810640	Does not change the game at all.
4810640	4811200	No, that happens.
4811200	4812480	That happens.
4812480	4816120	I mean, no one seems to react very much, but sure.
4816120	4817520	Did you guys not just see that bear?
4817520	4818120	It's glorious.
4818120	4820040	Yes, but don't we have bigger fish to fry?
4820040	4821240	I mean, we're in a world in Iran.
4821240	4823200	Guys, you guys are going to freak out
4823200	4825080	when I do what I'm about to do.
4827720	4828920	Do you want to go?
4828920	4830120	Gary Shambling.
4830120	4832360	Gary Shambling, laying on us.
4832360	4837720	Is my special ability of shielding aura,
4837720	4839440	that's not a thing I invoke.
4839440	4841560	Is that a thing that's just not passive?
4841560	4843560	I think you do have to invoke it.
4843560	4844400	OK.
4844400	4850120	Because it's allies within 20 feet get plus two armor class
4850120	4853280	per round, per level.
4853280	4856280	It would be either that or a channel energy.
4856280	4858440	If I feel like, have they gotten their asses kicked?
4858440	4861040	I mean, it's been like six months since we played.
4861040	4862840	Have we been kind of like taking a beating?
4862840	4865160	They've been taking damage, and they got some healing.
4865160	4866360	They could probably use some more healing.
4866360	4867960	You could do both of those, though,
4867960	4870960	because the aura is like a minor action.
4871120	4871620	Hwah.
4876360	4878860	Heal.
4878860	4880280	Ooh.
4880280	4880780	All right.
4880780	4882760	Do that.
4882760	4884240	Man, this is going to be great.
4887960	4890120	OK, everyone heals 13.
4890120	4891120	Damn.
4891120	4893760	I don't have a pen.
4893760	4894320	That's OK.
4894320	4901320	All right.
4901320	4903760	So the guy with the gun, he's upside down.
4903760	4906920	He's trying to shoot.
4906920	4908240	Whose turn is it?
4908240	4911040	It's my turn.
4911040	4913360	Oh, no.
4913360	4914360	Brandon's stuck.
4917160	4920200	Thank you, my good man.
4920200	4922640	Oh, no.
4922640	4923680	Brandon's high.
4924000	4927320	Oh, no.
4927320	4928280	Sorry, Brandon.
4928280	4929200	He'll fuck you up.
4932760	4935680	You were going to fuck the guy up?
4935680	4938360	He wasn't good at it, but he was willing to say so, right?
4938360	4940080	You were just bluffing, right?
4940080	4941800	You're not going to fuck anybody up.
4941800	4942300	No.
4947200	4949760	I think he's got it in him.
4949760	4950800	I think that's racist.
4954680	4956400	When do I get to say, what's racist?
4959960	4961880	He shoots a gun.
4961880	4963400	I jump in front.
4963400	4966280	I jump in front of the lightning.
4966280	4967760	All right, you do that.
4967760	4969840	Yes.
4969840	4976720	I jump in front of the lightning because I.
4976720	4977920	You got this, bro.
4977920	4979240	I got it.
4979240	4982040	Shambling mount is subjected to whenever the shambling
4982040	4985400	mount is subjected to lightning damage.
4985400	4989000	It takes no damage and regains a number of hit points
4989000	4990640	equal to the lightning damage still.
4996040	4999200	Those aren't our mics.
4999200	5001160	Rob's mic just took four damage.
5003960	5005040	All right, so.
5005040	5006800	Right?
5006800	5007520	Wait, what?
5007520	5008200	Right?
5008200	5009240	What do you mean, right?
5009240	5010520	What I just said.
5010520	5014160	Yeah, you're reading, right?
5014160	5015080	But it's right.
5015080	5016920	Yeah.
5016920	5018800	I've just revealed if you make something up
5018800	5021760	and sound like it's reading, I'll buy it.
5021760	5023720	Well, now I know that's how I convince you.
5023720	5025480	Yeah, so OK, you jump.
5025480	5027480	You jump in front of his lightning gun
5027480	5031000	right as he pulls the trigger and lightning blasts
5031000	5034160	into your body and through your vegetative mass,
5034160	5036600	energizing the wriggling writhing,
5036600	5039240	viney forms that make you up.
5039240	5039800	Yeah.
5039800	5043040	You regain 12 health, 12 health.
5043040	5043920	I'll take it.
5043920	5046120	Steve and Dan get hit by the lightning
5046120	5049360	as it cuts through the shambling mount.
5049360	5051000	You each take 12 damage.
5051000	5054320	What the fuck?
5054320	5055160	Guys.
5055160	5056360	Good thing you healed, huh?
5056360	5060960	Gary, you're supposed to absorb it.
5060960	5063440	Yeah, I am.
5063440	5067080	OK, at the same time, one of the far doors on the far wall
5067080	5070360	flies open, and you can see a little dwarf yelling.
5070360	5071320	And he's just yelling.
5071320	5072120	He's like, rah!
5072120	5074400	And he's holding what looks like a big baseball bat.
5074400	5076240	And he comes right towards one of these.
5076240	5077200	Jesus Christ!
5077200	5079400	What the fuck?
5079400	5082600	He comes right towards Jeff.
5082600	5083440	Who's the tree?
5083440	5084160	Chad.
5084160	5084920	Jeff.
5084920	5085600	Oh, Chad.
5085600	5087400	No, you're right.
5087400	5090040	I was like, no, you're Jeff.
5090040	5092480	I know this one.
5092480	5093320	He comes at me?
5093320	5094840	Does he mean me harm?
5094840	5095560	He does.
5095560	5096520	Yeah, he's wielding.
5096520	5097880	It looks like a wiffle ball bat.
5097880	5101400	Well, I say, are we going to bring a bat to a tree fight?
5101400	5102360	He does.
5102360	5104560	He brings a bat to a tree fight.
5104560	5106920	And the bat is smeared with poop.
5106920	5107800	Oh, boy.
5107800	5109480	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
5109480	5111160	You don't like it.
5111160	5112400	You don't like it?
5112400	5113440	It's a poop bat.
5113440	5116360	Does he attack me?
5116360	5117040	Say it.
5117040	5117960	Does he attack me?
5117960	5118960	Yeah, yeah, no.
5118960	5122080	He hits you with the bat, and you hear a pop.
5122080	5124960	And both of you disappear and reappear.
5124960	5128840	You guys, you see both of them dematerialize out of existence.
5128840	5129880	What the fuck?
5129880	5130680	What?
5130680	5133600	The Thanos.
5133600	5135720	A dwarf just hit me with a magic wiffle ball bat,
5135720	5136600	and now I'm gone?
5136600	5138080	Yeah.
5138080	5139320	And the dwarf's gone.
5139320	5141560	He's gone, too, yeah.
5141560	5142440	Briefly.
5142440	5146880	You reappear in a dark building filling with smoke.
5146880	5147920	But we don't see that.
5147920	5151120	No, you don't know that happens.
5151120	5153720	OK.
5153760	5155560	Hello.
5155560	5157040	Have we fucking met?
5157040	5157680	You're a tree.
5157680	5158560	You can't talk.
5158560	5160400	I'm OK.
5160400	5163560	He just smells like shit.
5163560	5165840	Am I in a different dimension than the rest of the fight
5165840	5166360	right now?
5166360	5168800	No, you feel like it's the same dimension.
5168800	5173240	OK, I summon nature's ally and get that bear.
5173240	5174520	Can you summon a bear?
5174520	5176320	I can summon a bear.
5176320	5176840	Can you?
5176840	5178960	I'm a druid.
5178960	5183240	I don't have it all written down here.
5183760	5187240	I can summon a creature to fight.
5187240	5188800	I just saw that bear walk by.
5188800	5190160	That's different.
5190160	5193560	You could use your speak with animals to talk to the bear.
5193560	5195840	Do you want to play the bear, Brandon?
5195840	5196320	Yes.
5196320	5197960	OK.
5197960	5199400	That's what I'm talking about.
5199400	5200960	Hey, bear.
5200960	5201720	Bear.
5201720	5203160	What can I do for you?
5203160	5207840	Hey, you know those times you use trees to scratch your ass
5207840	5210800	and climb up and get that honey and do all that shit?
5210800	5213960	Oh, I do, right after I steal a picnic basket.
5213960	5216600	OK, well, now you're being racist.
5220600	5223760	Don't marginalize bears.
5223760	5224640	Well, maybe I am, too.
5224640	5227920	I'm saying you look like a badass.
5227920	5229960	I might fuck somebody up.
5229960	5233520	I've been known to eat a porcupine.
5233520	5236080	How would you feel if you saw a dwarf walk up
5236080	5238880	with a magic wiffle ball bat and beat up a tree?
5238880	5242280	Is this bat covered in poop?
5242280	5244560	Is that what makes it magical?
5244560	5245520	I don't know.
5245520	5246840	It makes it shittier.
5246840	5247320	It makes it.
5247320	5248080	OK.
5248080	5250120	Well, I would like to tear him apart.
5250120	5250960	All right.
5250960	5252440	You want to join me in this fight?
5252440	5252960	I'd love to.
5252960	5255120	Let's get down.
5255120	5257480	And let it be known, I didn't even have to summon you.
5257480	5260160	I just had to talk to you.
5260160	5262840	I've always been looking for someone who would miss him.
5262840	5270200	Well, that's too bad, because this fight is a talker.
5273480	5276440	You've got to be kidding me.
5276440	5277520	I'm just fucking with you.
5277520	5278200	Let's do this.
5278200	5278700	Woo!
5287400	5288600	What's up?
5288600	5290520	Who wants to do who anyone could go?
5291520	5293240	So I'm back in my natural form right now.
5293240	5294240	Oh, you stopped being a tree?
5294240	5294760	OK.
5294760	5296960	Didn't you say I became, oh, I'm still a tree.
5296960	5298560	Yeah, unless you stop.
5298560	5302440	No, I'm going to go fucking bark skin.
5302440	5303720	OK.
5303720	5304960	That makes me tougher, right?
5304960	5305520	Yeah.
5305520	5309400	Yeah, try to hit me with that bat again, motherfucker.
5309400	5312120	My skin got, how much tougher is my bark now?
5312120	5314320	I want to say, what level are you?
5314320	5315320	Three?
5315320	5317080	I think you get plus three armor class.
5317080	5318200	OK.
5318200	5319240	Yeah, bark's in.
5319560	5320880	Yeah, plus three.
5320880	5322840	The bear, do you want to go?
5322840	5325440	Where are we going?
5325440	5327400	There's a dwarf with a wiffle ball bat,
5327400	5330200	and you saw a tree who just talked to you and asked you
5330200	5331000	to fight.
5331000	5332320	It just grew more bark.
5335760	5338320	I can still talk as a non-action movement, right?
5338320	5338800	Yeah.
5338800	5343320	I say, hey, just go full bear on this motherfucker.
5343320	5344680	Don't hold anything back.
5344680	5348600	Oh, I'm going to do them like Leo got dead in Revenant.
5348600	5351400	Yeah, fucking.
5351400	5354520	And I want it to last as long as that scene in Revenant.
5354520	5356200	I want you to sit on them for a while.
5356200	5357280	I want this to go on.
5357280	5361480	There will be moments where you think we're having sex.
5361480	5363360	But it will be an attack.
5363360	5368000	But I don't want to give a bear notes.
5368000	5371320	This time, the bear wins.
5371320	5373400	OK, well, you got damn right.
5373400	5380960	Let us go forth and catch this little wiffle ball bitch.
5380960	5382480	Just go attack this motherfucker.
5403400	5410320	You truly is high.
5410320	5411280	You're super high.
5419760	5422600	I can't do my other star.
5422600	5424280	Not yet.
5424280	5426360	All right, you hit him with your bear paw.
5429720	5431080	You deal nine damage.
5434320	5434820	Yeah.
5437960	5441240	You take a big chunk out of his side.
5441240	5443160	Yeah.
5443160	5445280	Hard fight to track, you know.
5445280	5445840	It moved.
5445840	5447280	It got moved to two places.
5447280	5448520	You guys should go.
5448520	5452400	No, it's hard to know if you're winning or losing, you know.
5452400	5454600	I've seen the bear.
5454600	5455920	I don't know if he's on our side.
5458920	5460440	Can I talk to our friends right now?
5460440	5461000	Are we on a different line?
5461000	5462040	No, you're in a different line.
5462040	5462680	You don't know.
5463360	5465800	Can I have an audible here?
5465800	5468520	I wanted to ask you, who's in the room right now?
5468520	5469960	The guy with the gun.
5469960	5473080	There's one guy in the gun, and then the rest of us.
5473080	5473600	Yeah.
5473600	5475720	OK, continue.
5475720	5478640	You guys continue.
5478640	5479840	Dan, you haven't said anything.
5479840	5483520	For a while, do something.
5483520	5487520	I'm going to get this motherfucker.
5487520	5493120	And the way I'm going to do it is magically.
5493120	5501440	With a spell I like to call Inflict Light Wounds.
5501440	5518080	It sounds, it's bite is worse than its bark.
5522080	5523440	All right.
5523440	5525080	And you're going for the gun guy?
5525080	5526000	Yeah.
5526000	5528080	There's only one guy in the room.
5528080	5530000	Is he going to go for us?
5530000	5532040	Do you have to ask that question?
5532040	5533840	Yes.
5533840	5534560	All right.
5534560	5535200	You do it.
5535200	5537440	Your hands crackle with fell energies
5537440	5539320	as you touch into his body.
5539320	5543120	Thou shall do harm.
5543120	5546120	You can feel the shock of the spell release.
5546120	5548760	It feels like a very powerful electric spark.
5548760	5550200	And it's crazy.
5550200	5552280	You could just see instantly his flesh just
5552280	5554880	starts necrotizing and sizzling.
5554880	5557600	Like the whole side of his body goes black.
5557600	5559240	He's all messed up.
5559760	5562840	He's been hurt really bad.
5562840	5565000	While that's happening, I want to Captain America
5565000	5566360	throw my shield at him.
5566360	5568440	Just whip it at him really fucking hard.
5568440	5570320	All right.
5570320	5571640	You do that.
5571640	5574240	You hit him in the teeth.
5574240	5575600	You get him for six damage.
5575600	5576960	Nice.
5576960	5578200	And teeth damage hurts.
5578200	5579240	I do.
5579240	5580280	Can I go?
5580280	5581200	Yeah, yeah.
5581200	5584200	OK, I do a slam attack, multi-slam attack.
5584200	5585960	How much damage?
5585960	5587440	How much damage does it do?
5587440	5588240	Oh, so much.
5592400	5593480	Plus eight?
5593480	5597480	Nah, the dice is like 2D something.
5597480	5598520	You fucking nerd.
5601120	5604960	Yeah, 2D six plus five plus grab.
5604960	5606800	Awesome.
5606800	5609200	So I slam and grab him.
5609200	5610400	All right.
5610400	5614880	You hit him for eight damage with your meaty paw.
5614880	5615880	Vegetable.
5617960	5619000	Yeah.
5619000	5620280	OK.
5620280	5621720	Veggie paw.
5621720	5623640	Now it happens.
5623640	5625120	Now it happens.
5625120	5626640	My turn.
5626640	5629120	He pulls out his gun.
5629120	5631520	And he shoots it.
5631520	5632800	He shoots it at Steve.
5632800	5636000	And it's like, click, click, click, click, click, click,
5636000	5637120	like it's empty.
5637120	5638120	Damn, dude.
5638120	5640520	And then he throws it at Steve.
5640520	5641760	What?
5641760	5642760	It's a critical hit.
5642760	5644440	Can I catch it?
5644440	5645600	Yeah, sure you can catch it.
5645600	5646920	I want to catch that gun.
5647080	5649080	All right.
5649080	5652560	It hits you in the face for five damage.
5652560	5653160	Ow.
5653160	5654360	And then you catch it.
5654360	5655560	You caught it with your face.
5655560	5656560	All right, I still got it.
5656560	5659200	I whip it right back at his face.
5659200	5660520	OK, well, it's not your turn.
5660520	5663160	But you could do that.
5663160	5667040	Then at the same time, you see the corpse of one
5667040	5670560	of the guys you killed, he kind of like magically kind of lifts
5670560	5671680	up onto his feet.
5671680	5674200	It's very disturbing, almost like a puppet
5674200	5676160	being raised by its strings.
5676160	5680520	And you can see he's been sliced in half by when he exploded.
5680520	5683720	But you could see his sinews kind of coming back together.
5683720	5685520	And then he crawls up onto the ceiling.
5685520	5686600	And he starts hissing.
5686600	5687320	Which guy?
5687320	5688480	Which guy is this?
5688480	5690040	OK, so you might not remember him,
5690040	5691280	because this is way back when.
5691280	5695280	But one of the three guys had a big robot juggernaut arm
5695280	5695960	kind of thing.
5695960	5699760	And he went as to punch you and immediately just exploded,
5699760	5702840	because his arm exploded.
5702840	5705440	But now he's seemingly come back from the dead
5705560	5707960	and his hissing on the ceiling, like a cockroach.
5707960	5708880	Shit.
5708880	5709640	What a feeling.
5714520	5716080	When you're hissing on the ceiling.
5725760	5727960	Man, I'm going to engulf him.
5727960	5731800	All right, let's go back to the shack then.
5731800	5732560	This is a bear shack?
5732560	5734560	Yeah, you're a tree with more bark.
5734600	5736200	All right, whose turn is this?
5736200	5736680	It's you.
5736680	5738160	You're a tree, more bark.
5738160	5740400	I've been waiting to use this spell for a good old time.
5740400	5742440	Do I have another spell on me right now?
5742440	5744240	It depends on the spell level.
5744240	5745960	It's a first level.
5745960	5746960	One, two.
5746960	5748880	Yeah, I think maybe you have a one left.
5748880	5754440	OK, I cast Magic Fang, which gives one natural weapon
5754440	5755760	of my subject creature.
5755760	5757560	He gets a plus one attack.
5757560	5760200	So I can make his claws or his teeth.
5760200	5761560	You get a plus one.
5761560	5763560	So I just beefed up the bear.
5763560	5765480	The bear gets Magic Fangs.
5765480	5770000	You feel a magical sharpness embody your parts.
5770000	5775400	Oh, oh, the sharpness.
5775400	5779440	Oh, I'm still going to do damage.
5779440	5781960	I like this.
5781960	5785240	I feel more bad.
5785240	5788080	Do you?
5788080	5790000	I turn over to the bear.
5790000	5792200	First off, we never exchange names.
5792200	5792720	I'm Chad.
5792720	5793440	What's your name?
5793440	5796080	Bernie Mac.
5796080	5799000	Yeah, that's our show.
5799000	5801480	John.
5801480	5802280	John and Chris.
5802280	5806600	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
5806600	5807560	Bernie Mac?
5807560	5808160	Bernie Mac.
5808160	5810200	How long were you sitting on that joke, Brennan?
5813800	5815960	10 years old.
5815960	5818720	Bernie Mac, not only did your fangs just get sharper
5818720	5821480	because I'm a druid who made your teeth a little sharper.
5821480	5822200	Thank you.
5822280	5824120	When you attack, I think you'll find out.
5824120	5825640	Remember all that crazy noise that you
5825640	5827560	made when you were attacking earlier?
5827560	5829160	It gets me going.
5829160	5830280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5830280	5831840	Well, this gets a little weirder.
5836400	5840440	Also, sometimes the bear goes into a little Bernie Mac
5840440	5842240	stand up in the middle of the attack.
5842240	5845400	Oh, oh, oh, bees, bees, huh, bees.
5845400	5847120	You're not going to give me none of that honey.
5847120	5849920	You're going to give me some of that honey.
5849920	5854480	You're going to give me some of that son of a bitch honey.
5854480	5855720	I'll bite your face off.
5855720	5857440	I'll bite you son of a bitch friend's home.
5857440	5860760	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
5860760	5861240	OK.
5864960	5867040	Now you still got to go attack this dude.
5867040	5868560	I'll attack this mother fucker.
5868560	5870840	You ain't going to tell me not to attack no mother.
5870840	5872100	I'm going to attack him right now.
5872100	5873480	I'll walk up to his front door.
5873480	5875160	I'll walk up to his front door.
5875160	5876400	I'll attack his front door.
5876400	5877560	Now I'll attack his mama.
5879920	5882840	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5882840	5884360	OK, hold on.
5884360	5885680	All right.
5885680	5886680	This is a critical mess.
5886680	5888760	I'm going to have a heart attack.
5888760	5890000	It's not.
5890000	5891080	It's better than that.
5893840	5894720	It's damaged.
5900760	5901720	All right.
5901720	5904240	You smash him in the face with a bear paw,
5904240	5907680	and then you hit him on the other side of his head.
5907680	5908800	So you're holding him in the head.
5908840	5910840	And then you maul his face.
5910840	5911520	It's great.
5911520	5913080	You deal 24 damage.
5913080	5913580	Oh, yeah.
5917960	5920120	Bernie Mac.
5920120	5921000	All right.
5921000	5922960	He's flailing around.
5922960	5927720	And as his face is being hit and eaten, he lashes out,
5927720	5930880	and he hits you with a bat, and both of you poof and go outside.
5930880	5932000	And now you're somewhere else.
5932000	5936560	But as that happens, you finish eating his face.
5936560	5938720	So he's dead now.
5939600	5940640	But we're outside.
5940640	5941600	Well, not you.
5941600	5943920	You're inside, and you're a tree.
5943920	5946560	So if the cops come, I'm in trouble.
5946560	5948040	Yeah.
5948040	5950920	Fucking Bernie Mac's just chilling outside.
5950920	5953360	He's with the corpse, though.
5953360	5954720	Oh, he's back with the other guy.
5954720	5955560	Yeah, he teleported.
5955560	5957360	No, well, he's in a third location.
5957360	5958840	Jeez.
5958840	5961200	Oh, it's fun.
5961200	5965320	In the underground place, also, the guy's still hissing
5965320	5966680	on the ceiling.
5966760	5969320	The other guy doesn't have a gun because Steve caught it.
5972600	5974440	Am I grabbing him still?
5974440	5975960	Which?
5975960	5976840	No.
5976840	5978400	You tried to grab him and failed.
5978400	5980200	I didn't call that out, but.
5980200	5981840	OK, well, thanks for telling me.
5981840	5985080	Well, I did not say that you grabbed him.
5985080	5986840	OK.
5986840	5991240	Well, I suppose I have no choice.
5991240	5995080	I've got to summon the level of monster
5995080	5997640	that I'm allowed to.
5997640	5998560	Probably a little one.
6001080	6004880	I had to summon monster one.
6004880	6010920	I'd like to summon a monster of the kind that can climb walls.
6010920	6013920	I hope there's an ant in there, maybe.
6013920	6015120	You know what there's what?
6015120	6017360	An ant?
6017360	6021000	I think that feels like there's an ant.
6021000	6022080	Ant giant ant.
6022080	6024080	Does it have to be giant?
6024080	6024960	It does, yeah.
6025080	6026760	You're going to want it to be.
6026760	6028280	You love those big ants.
6028280	6029320	Check this out.
6029320	6031760	You like that ceiling?
6031760	6032920	Omnibus jumanjibus.
6039760	6040360	I forget.
6040360	6043120	What's your race and classic event?
6043120	6045240	I don't see the world through that lens.
6045240	6062040	I am a human, size medium, gender medium, class, human.
6062040	6062880	He's a cleric.
6062880	6065920	Cleric, OK, good.
6065920	6066400	Carry on.
6070320	6074040	Antimum summonum.
6074040	6074960	All right.
6075960	6080320	The ant feverishly comes out of another dimension
6080320	6083360	and climbs up a wall and then onto the ceiling.
6083360	6087480	And you can see his powerful mandibles snap the guy right
6087480	6090680	on the foot with his jaws and leg scissors.
6090680	6092760	They just snip his foot clean off,
6092760	6094240	and it falls to the floor.
6094240	6096560	Yikes.
6096560	6097960	He hisses more screamingly.
6100960	6103520	Someone else.
6103520	6106800	I engulf what's left of him.
6106800	6108240	He's on the ceiling?
6108240	6110720	Yeah.
6110720	6112000	You can't reach.
6112000	6112480	What?
6112480	6113320	You can't reach.
6113320	6115440	What if I jumped?
6115440	6118280	You can try that, but you might fail.
6118280	6120440	Well, you're going to try jumping engulf.
6123280	6125520	Yeah, what are we playing at here?
6125520	6126800	Why not?
6126800	6128200	What are we trying to do here?
6128200	6129520	Yeah.
6129520	6131640	I just ate lightning with my body.
6131640	6134720	I think I can do this.
6134720	6135600	OK.
6135600	6136560	I do a jump.
6136560	6142560	I do like a, I do a, I roll up in a ball, but then I jump,
6142560	6143960	and I'm like, whoa.
6143960	6149040	And I like throw myself at him to engulf him.
6149040	6149960	And?
6149960	6150560	All right.
6150560	6151320	Does it work?
6151320	6154440	You jump up there after rolling up into a ball
6154440	6157160	to like gather potential energy.
6157160	6160320	And you hit him, but you just barely graze him.
6160800	6162160	So.
6162160	6163560	It's not even a slam?
6163560	6164160	No.
6164160	6165240	It missed as a slam.
6165240	6166440	I see that in the license.
6166440	6168640	We didn't think you were going to make it.
6168640	6171520	Didn't even think you were going to touch him.
6171520	6172480	Thank you.
6172480	6173160	Thank you.
6173160	6175600	It's, you know, I mean, you're not going to get anywhere.
6175600	6178160	And like, if you don't try, you miss every.
6178160	6181560	You miss 100% of the chances you don't take, right?
6181560	6183080	That's what they say.
6183080	6184120	Yeah.
6184120	6187400	Actually, Wayne Gretzky.
6187400	6189880	Oh, god.
6189880	6190880	Know the room.
6195560	6197360	Wayne Gretzky.
6197360	6197840	What?
6197840	6199440	What are you talking about?
6199440	6204080	Does that do one damage to everyone else in my deck?
6204080	6205680	I don't know anything about magic.
6205680	6207800	What Deep Space Nine episode was he in?
6207800	6210480	What's that?
6210480	6212560	What's that new red skull chain attack?
6212560	6213920	Chain roller goblin.
6213920	6217080	It's a rare from Dominaria.
6217080	6218480	Yeah, that's what we were saying.
6218480	6220040	It's got your decks.
6220040	6221320	It's got first strike.
6223880	6226240	You can deal one damage to every other character
6226240	6227440	in the other guy's deck.
6227440	6228120	Oh, man.
6228120	6230680	Random up red is going to infect this meta.
6230680	6231560	I tell you what.
6231560	6233120	Standard's not going to be the same
6233120	6235360	after chain roller goblin comes through.
6235360	6237000	Are we still playing?
6237000	6238360	Yeah, more or less.
6238360	6241160	What's happening?
6241160	6246400	In the Sumerian times, I appeared as a great chlorthos.
6246400	6248880	Many chlorthos nudists like to roast
6248880	6251320	in the belly of a mirthos that day, I tell you.
6254920	6256440	I don't know the real news.
6256440	6257840	Spence, the gun that I'm holding,
6257840	6259640	it's just totally out of ammo.
6259640	6260840	Yeah, it seems to be empty.
6260840	6264280	You can't catch lightning in a gun more than one.
6264280	6265360	That's just out of ammo?
6265360	6266080	Yeah.
6266080	6267760	I can for sure tell that.
6267760	6269800	Yeah, well, I mean, you can pull the trigger.
6269800	6270280	OK.
6270280	6270800	And it's empty.
6270800	6271800	So it's not like fixable.
6271800	6272280	All right.
6272280	6272760	Well, you don't.
6272760	6274920	I mean, you're not a wizard.
6274920	6277360	So you don't know how to fix a magic thing.
6277360	6280600	Let me look at it.
6280600	6281800	How hard can this be?
6281800	6284040	OK, I give Gary the gun.
6284040	6287840	And then I charge the guy on the ground with my Elvish blade.
6287840	6290040	I want to slice his head clean.
6290040	6291800	OK.
6291800	6295200	He doesn't really try and dodge.
6295200	6298320	You get him.
6298320	6299920	Oh, yeah.
6299920	6302520	What's your strength bonus?
6302520	6303640	It's 18 plus four.
6303680	6305920	OK, you deal seven damage.
6305920	6307440	You hit him in the neck.
6307440	6309840	Jesus Christ.
6309840	6312520	It doesn't go through, but it's real deep and gross.
6312520	6313920	Yeah, describe it to me.
6313920	6317040	Well, it's not like it goes.
6317040	6317920	Look at your biceps.
6317920	6321920	You need to walk that talk back.
6321920	6324480	You're scaring people.
6324480	6326080	I'm sorry, man arms.
6326080	6327560	Sorry.
6327560	6329000	Is the blood shooting everywhere?
6329000	6332800	Yeah, it went down instead of sideways through his neck.
6332800	6335320	So it's just kind of like he's cleft open kind
6335320	6336880	of in his collarbone area.
6336880	6338800	And he's just spewing.
6338800	6341840	I stop examining the lightning gun
6341840	6346800	and just take a step back and go,
6346800	6348200	I just met you guys.
6348200	6352160	But I mean, you were beating up this tied up person
6352160	6355680	in my living room earlier today.
6355680	6360120	And now you're cutting people's necks.
6360120	6360840	I don't know.
6360840	6364280	I'm just, this is all being said with my face
6364280	6366760	because this is all happening so fast.
6366760	6375760	But my expression is like, if you gave me a glance,
6375760	6381760	you would probably go, he's questioning what is going on.
6381760	6382600	You know what I mean?
6382600	6383080	Yeah.
6383080	6386520	You know, like you would be in a room
6386520	6388920	and then somebody says something and everybody laughs,
6388920	6389920	but you didn't like it.
6390840	6391960	Yeah.
6391960	6397160	You know, like one of those, it's kind of like, yeah.
6397160	6399960	Yeah.
6399960	6401280	You're going through all the stuff
6401280	6404480	that when you retell the story later, you'll be like,
6404480	6408720	and I'm like, yeah, I was like, and I was like,
6408720	6412640	what the fuck is going on here?
6412640	6415800	I am not.
6415800	6417960	I do not want any part of this.
6418000	6420160	And somebody would say, you said that?
6420160	6421640	No, I was like that.
6421640	6423640	I was like that.
6423640	6424640	I was like that.
6428640	6429160	Yep.
6429160	6431080	So is my blade still in his neck?
6431080	6431840	Yeah, no.
6431840	6435280	I mean, it's part of the attack that withdraw the blade
6435280	6435760	and stuff.
6435760	6437280	OK, OK.
6437280	6443360	Being made out of plant, the blood is weird to me, right?
6443360	6444920	It's weird.
6444920	6447240	No, you're a carnivorous plant.
6447240	6450520	If we water him with blood, we'll feed me.
6450520	6451520	But you eat blood.
6456520	6458600	Thank you, Steve.
6458600	6460760	What's happening?
6460760	6461680	I got a little drunk.
6461680	6464160	A little shop of horses.
6464160	6469520	So I'm like going, is that what I'm doing?
6469520	6471720	Well, I mean, it's your choice.
6471720	6475640	But you're not unused to blood because you're like a shark.
6475640	6477040	Wouldn't you do that for poop?
6477040	6477760	You're a plant.
6477760	6480480	Wouldn't you be more into poop?
6480480	6482280	No, not into poop.
6482280	6485760	It's not fertilizer.
6485760	6487560	I'm with Carlos on this one.
6487560	6489680	I think you like poop.
6489680	6492720	Nitrogen and he's a carnivorous plant.
6492720	6496520	Just finish killing this guy, OK?
6496520	6499000	Look, you're boring the DM.
6499000	6501080	So what's happening with this guy?
6501080	6502840	What's happening with this guy?
6502840	6505280	The guy on the ceiling, he's been hissing.
6505400	6507440	It was more of a screaming hiss.
6507440	6509800	He jumps down onto the ground and grabs
6509800	6513640	the guy who was holding a flaming sword before he dies.
6513640	6516280	And he plunges his mouth into his body
6516280	6517760	and starts sucking out his blood.
6517760	6520160	And he dries him hot.
6520160	6522640	He sucks him dry like a husk.
6522640	6525520	And then he just blasts, newly empowered.
6525520	6530520	He does a Shoryuken uppercut and blasts through the ceiling.
6530520	6531400	Shuruken?
6531400	6532920	While hissing.
6532920	6535840	And then he like ninja flips like a crazy vampire
6535840	6536680	out of the building.
6536680	6537320	What the fuck?
6537320	6539800	This guy.
6539800	6541640	All while hissing.
6541640	6544640	Yeah.
6544640	6545920	The plot thickens.
6545920	6548280	We've not got a single answer on what the fuck
6548280	6549920	is going on anymore.
6549920	6552520	Are we back in the other part?
6552520	6553120	I'm the tree.
6553120	6555800	Meanwhile, in the shack, it's filling with smoke.
6555800	6557440	And your bark is thicker than ever.
6557440	6559680	All right.
6559680	6564880	Can I turn back into a druid my regular form?
6564880	6566000	100%.
6566000	6568720	And I want to pick up that fucking teleportation
6568720	6569520	wiffleball bat.
6569520	6570240	I want that.
6570240	6571040	It's not there.
6571040	6572400	It's outside.
6572400	6574280	I walk outside and go get that bat.
6574280	6574840	OK.
6574840	6576120	You see a bear.
6576120	6577040	He's eating a corpse.
6580800	6583240	I walk around just kind of testing things out.
6583240	6587280	I see like the edge of the doorway.
6587280	6589080	And I tap it with the bat, just testing out
6589120	6590160	the properties of this bat.
6590160	6590960	Nothing happens.
6590960	6592120	OK.
6592120	6592920	I go up to the bat.
6592920	6593640	I go up to the bear.
6593640	6595200	I say, look, bear any mac.
6595200	6597800	When you're done, I got to say, I really
6597800	6600440	appreciate what you did.
6600440	6601840	You ate the fuck out of that, dude.
6605280	6606920	Stand with me.
6606920	6609480	Let's hold hands.
6609480	6610920	Put your paw on my hand.
6610920	6612000	And I'm going to take this bat.
6612000	6614840	And I'm going to tap us both at the same time with this bat.
6614840	6615480	See if I can.
6615480	6618680	You're not going to hit me with that bat.
6619480	6620920	You're not going to go tap me.
6620920	6621920	It's a little tap.
6621920	6623720	You're not even going to tap me.
6623720	6624640	Why are you tapping me?
6624640	6626000	I will do it like this.
6626000	6627520	I will do it like that.
6627520	6629360	I will do it with a whippled ball bat.
6634520	6635200	And so we hold it.
6635200	6636440	We hold paw and hand.
6636440	6637520	And I do a double tap.
6637520	6639840	And I'm hitting both of us at the same time.
6639840	6640360	All right.
6640360	6643000	If he can sense to that, sure.
6643000	6643360	Right.
6643360	6644800	That's cool.
6644800	6645480	More swimming.
6645480	6646680	Yeah.
6646680	6647760	You could try to dodge it.
6647760	6649480	Anyway, you do it.
6649480	6654760	You teleport 20 feet up in the air and fall 20 feet.
6654760	6658560	Your legs hurt, but you don't take any damage.
6658560	6659360	All right.
6659360	6659960	That's my bat.
6665520	6667200	I decide to make amends.
6667200	6668280	Look, I don't know what's going on.
6668280	6671000	I just tap myself lightly on the head with the bat.
6671000	6671960	You disappear.
6678760	6680400	Where do I go?
6680400	6681160	All right.
6681160	6684120	You reappear back in the room with everyone,
6684120	6685280	without the bear.
6685280	6687960	Oh, I wanted the bear.
6687960	6689760	I hit myself again.
6689760	6691160	All right.
6691160	6694000	You reappear outside 30 feet in the air and you fall.
6696800	6697640	No damage?
6697640	6698240	Not yet.
6698240	6698720	OK.
6705560	6707320	Geographically, am I near the bear?
6707320	6708040	Can I see the bear?
6708040	6708680	Is it totally different?
6708680	6709160	Yeah.
6709160	6712960	When you were airborne, you could see the bear.
6712960	6716640	Barony Mac, come to the sound of my voice.
6716640	6719880	I haven't quite got the hang of this wiffleball bat yet.
6719880	6721960	Fall on me.
6721960	6723080	I'll break your fall.
6723080	6725720	You're 30 feet in the air.
6725720	6726320	That happens.
6729800	6730880	I already landed, though, right?
6730880	6731400	Yeah, yeah.
6731400	6731880	All right.
6731880	6736080	What do you say we stop fucking with this wiffleball bat?
6737080	6739960	You let me finish eating this dude.
6739960	6742440	Is the bat still smeared with poop?
6742440	6743600	Yep, the whole time.
6743600	6746480	Yeah.
6746480	6749240	All I want in my cinematic mind's eye
6749240	6751960	is for me to come back to the rest of the party
6751960	6755440	with a bear and a bat covered in poop
6755440	6758680	and not give any explanation about what happened.
6758680	6761800	Well, as it relates to the bat, we
6761800	6763760	didn't have any rabbits to wipe our ass with.
6766080	6774160	I'm putting all these jokes in a book for your grandpa.
6774160	6776640	You don't cover the hunt, do you?
6776640	6777760	It's another bear joke.
6777760	6778280	Yay.
6778280	6778760	All right.
6778760	6780600	So are we back with the group now?
6780600	6781840	Well, you didn't do anything.
6781840	6785720	I'm trying to walk with the bear back to me.
6785720	6787000	Oh, yeah, no, you walk back.
6787000	6788440	OK, you walk back in.
6788440	6789600	You wander back in.
6789600	6793080	And yeah, there's a guy screaming and bleeding.
6793080	6794920	It's great.
6794920	6797040	Chad's back.
6797040	6798760	And look at the fur on this guy.
6798760	6799920	It's so smooth.
6799920	6801040	It's so soft.
6801040	6804000	Oh, Jesus.
6804000	6806000	I'm sorry.
6806000	6808320	Beautiful.
6808320	6811600	The fuck is going on?
6811600	6812400	This is crazy.
6812400	6813720	Where'd you go?
6813720	6814760	I run around.
6814760	6815760	I get everybody.
6815760	6816640	Let's huddle up.
6816640	6817440	Get in the circle.
6817440	6819720	All right, well, one more enemy left, I think.
6819720	6820240	Oh, there is?
6820240	6821040	Yeah.
6821040	6821760	Isn't there?
6821760	6824720	Yeah, but he's screaming and bleeding and unarmed.
6825120	6828600	We should probably take him prisoner, interrogate him.
6829800	6832440	We've been good at that.
6832440	6834960	Why don't we have him dig his own grave and just.
6837480	6839840	Cliffhanger.
6842800	6843440	Thank you all.
6848800	6852360	Thank you all for coming down to our first show at the Doomsday Telegraph.
6852360	6854680	Wherever the fucking place is called.
6855160	6856960	Can we get up for our guest, Rob Shropp?
6859960	6862640	Brandon Johnson.
6862640	6863720	Steve Levy.
6866240	6870520	Also, Church, you saw Zach Bryant here on Tech.
6870520	6874240	Chris, Sarah, Vanessa, who I met earlier.
6874240	6875120	What a wonderful theater.
6875120	6878320	Thank you so much, all of you, for being our first guest down at the new place.
6878320	6885440	Try it fast and take chances.
6885440	6886200	We love you all.
6903440	6904320	Did you get any of that?
6905960	6907680	It's a good show.
