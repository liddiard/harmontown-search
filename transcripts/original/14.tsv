0	1000	Yeah.
1000	16800	Ladies and gentlemen, Carmen Town is now in session.
16800	28180	As the groovy, funky Swedish strains of Ace of Bass gently wash over your cerebral car
28180	40740	taxis, please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harmon.
40740	48340	I think he, seamless, seamless opening tonight.
48340	53580	For those of you listening in podcast land, there's a 15 minute ordeal trying to get that
53580	54860	Ace of Bass song queued up.
54860	58340	I had to go to the mayor's iPod.
58340	59700	I think we do that from now on.
59700	63500	Actually, we're using your iPod for Ace of Bass, but I say from now on, if people in
63500	66620	the crowd have a good song, we kick it off with that one.
66620	67620	Until we get sued.
67620	68620	Yeah.
68620	73100	Someone will come in with a Chevy Chase voicemail on their phone and say, I'm going to open
73100	74100	it with this.
74100	75100	You can have my phone back.
75100	77100	Oh, shit.
77100	78100	So welcome.
78100	83300	I would like to thank Jeff Davis for controlling tonight as he always does.
83300	88500	I have some notes.
88500	92940	I want to apologize to those of you, I assume, if you're coming here and you're laying $10
92940	98220	on the barrel head, then that means that you're probably a Harman Town podcast subscriber.
98220	99540	That means that you're probably very upset.
99540	103860	The last couple weeks, there has been no new Harman Town podcast.
103860	104860	We're two weeks behind.
104860	106940	I was in North Carolina with Erin.
106940	115620	Her little brother was getting married in what unfolded into a very awkward turn of
115620	118980	events, which I may discuss momentarily.
118980	120580	I'm just looking at my phone here.
120580	123860	I have my Evernote app loaded up.
123860	125800	Things tagged Harman Town.
125800	128180	Some of them are mild complaints that I have.
128180	131420	Some little observations.
131420	133340	Perhaps a pied d'etre.
133340	138780	No, that's an expression that means an apartment.
138780	145260	Sometimes you just throw a three-word French phrase into things and just give a little
145260	149980	joie de vivre to a little je ne sais quoi.
149980	151980	Here's a complaint.
151980	154780	We had some good luck with me complaining about things.
154780	159580	I didn't think that complaining was charismatic, but we had a good time complaining about things
159580	161940	that I have no right to complain about.
161940	165660	Someone call that a segment of our show.
165660	170100	My mustache is too absorbent.
170100	171100	I have to trim it.
171100	175580	I was out of town for like 12 days, and I had no trimmer with me.
175580	184900	It really soaks up quite a bit of vodka, milkshakes, whatever happened to be going into my mouth.
184900	188580	You don't feel it because I don't have any nerve endings in my mustache.
188580	191340	I wish.
191340	192340	Cats do.
192340	193340	Walruses.
193340	194340	Yeah.
194340	200140	I don't use my mustache to detect the width of openings I want to get through.
200140	204900	Is the bummer for you that you're being robbed of vodka and milkshakes?
204900	205900	That's where that went.
205900	206900	That's why I'm still sober.
206900	208820	It's all in my damn mustache.
208820	215580	No, the bummer is I have no feeling up there.
215580	223500	If I'm drinking vodka for a while, for instance, just as a crazy hypothetical, I can't feel
223500	224500	it.
224500	225500	It just feels normal.
225500	230980	But then if I go to, I would say, kiss Erin on the head or something.
230980	231980	It's like a sponge.
231980	237020	All of a sudden, there's just liquid everywhere all over her head.
237020	238580	She doesn't complain about it.
238580	243100	I guess it's nice because then she smells like vodka.
243100	245500	I don't know, but I guess there's nothing wrong with her.
245500	248900	Maybe I'll cross that off my complaint list.
248900	252220	Maybe that goes into a bragging column.
252220	254460	Mustache absorption.
254460	255460	But I trimmed it down.
255460	256460	It's fine.
256460	257460	Okay.
257460	258460	Moving on.
258460	261260	Any more complaints in here?
261260	264580	Let's see here.
264580	269640	Well, I, we discuss, okay, here's a couple things.
269640	272540	Last time I did this segment where I complained about things I'm not allowed to complain about,
272540	276300	I started talking about airports because I wanted to get to this one thing I never
276300	277300	got to.
277300	280980	They have these stupid machines on the, oh, I talked about this yesterday at the, was
280980	287740	anyone there yesterday at the thing, the podcast festival?
287740	289180	Your girlfriend and our producer.
289180	290180	Right.
290180	291580	And there's one guy who raised his hand.
291580	292580	Okay.
292580	293580	Well, bummer for you.
293580	295580	I'm just going to say everything again.
295580	297300	What's up with this Tyler Perry guy?
297300	301140	No, I was making that up.
301140	302660	What is up with this Tyler Perry guy?
302660	303660	I've never seen him in anything.
303660	304660	I don't know.
304660	306740	Well, he's, he's now he's, he's, he's in a movie.
306740	308580	I don't know anything about Tyler Perry.
308580	314540	I saw, I saw the first, I think the was breakout, his clerks, what was it called?
314540	316620	Medea diary of a mad black woman.
316620	317620	I think it was.
317620	318620	I don't know.
318620	324260	Since then there's been several, Medea has become the black earnest.
324260	325300	She goes to camp.
325300	326380	She goes to prison.
326380	327980	She goes to hell.
327980	330100	She goes to outer space.
330100	331100	She saves Christmas.
331100	333100	Is she really?
333100	334100	One of those is true.
334100	337740	I swear to God, I don't know which one, but I know one of them is true.
337740	340460	She has either saved Christmas or gone to prison.
340460	342140	No, I know.
342140	343140	I think both.
343140	344140	Didn't Medea save Christmas?
344140	345140	She did?
345140	346140	No.
346140	347140	She's gone to prison.
347140	349180	She's gone to prison for sure.
349180	354500	But did she save Christmas and tea?
354500	357580	You can't just ask, ask the one black audience.
357580	358580	Did it as a joke.
358580	359580	I knew he didn't know.
359580	360580	I bet he does.
360580	364860	I bet he does.
364860	367980	Auntie don't know nothing about no Tyler Perry.
367980	369580	Auntie don't truck with no Tyler.
369580	371860	That'd be a drag.
371860	375700	I say I was saying to Aaron in the car on the way over because we drove past one of
375700	376700	his billboards.
376700	377700	It must have been rough.
377700	382620	If you were Tyler Perry's roommate, you know, there's a lot of post-it notes in that fridge.
382620	383620	Get it?
383620	384620	No.
385140	393260	Probably labels everything, you know, with his name is the guy, a guy give a thumbs down
393260	400500	and now is flipping me off and he's wearing like a, it's like a poncho polo shirt with
400500	401500	a hood.
401500	407100	Now he put the hood up because he's gangsta and I don't know what to make of you, sir.
407100	408700	Well, he gave you thumbs up and then flipped you.
408700	413180	No, he gave me thumbs down and then I made eye contact with him and then he just started
413180	416100	flipping me the finger.
416100	418020	This crowd is crazy.
418020	420420	Harmon town's, Harmon town's crazy.
420420	421620	Okay.
421620	422900	So I don't know where to begin.
422900	425100	Tyler Perry, that boy, that landed on its ass.
425100	426100	Wait, I didn't.
426100	427100	Well, that was.
427100	428100	So we go back to that.
428100	431940	You were saying that Tyler Perry would say this is Tyler Perry's mustard or it's funny.
431940	435900	I thought I was too, you know, it was too much of a, too much of a dot connector.
435900	436900	You know who probably loved that?
436900	438900	Adam Goldberg probably loved that.
439900	447140	It was an Asperger joke or as you call it, Asperger's.
447140	455300	Adam Goldberg just hangs out now, which is fine, I guess.
455300	456300	He's a weirdo.
456300	458140	He's a lovable weirdo.
458140	460140	I'm a misfit.
460140	464140	Harmon town is about founding a colony of misfits.
464140	467860	Adam Goldberg should have some kind of statue of him somewhere on the moon if we get there.
468460	469460	But he was hanging out.
469460	474420	He just popped by the drawing room, our watering hole, and we were hanging out with Eric Eitel
474420	477420	from Monty Python fame.
477420	481620	I had to list his credits, Eric Eitel from Monty Python.
481620	486380	From European vacation.
486380	493500	Jeff is friends with this comedy icon, legend, and we were hanging out with him at our local
493500	496100	watering hole and Adam Goldberg was there.
496100	504620	So we ended up at my house hanging out, and Adam Goldberg was leaving the house at the
504620	507980	same time as Eric Eitel, and we were like, oh, everybody, good night, good night, everybody,
507980	508980	good night.
508980	511700	And Adam turned to Eric Eitel and said, hey, it was really nice to meet you.
511700	512700	Do you have a card?
519700	521700	Wait, he just comes up.
521700	523420	Adam just stormed the stage.
523420	525420	He just stormed the stage.
525740	530500	I think there's something to be mined from the encounter with what I thought was just
530500	533580	a cool old British dude.
533580	538780	I can't believe, I didn't come here in June to be like, I'm going to involve myself in
538780	539780	Dan Harmon's life.
539780	540780	But now that I'm-
540780	544180	Says the guy that just stormed the stage and grabbed a microphone.
544180	546180	I've been impugned, Jeff.
546180	547180	No, I'm-
547180	548180	What?
548180	549180	It's a quirky story about you.
549180	552220	Do you deny any part of that story?
552220	558580	First flashback, I have spent- because I can kind of show the tapestry of what you've
558580	561300	accused of asperginess.
561300	566540	I would much prefer, if we said the word personality, I'd like to think that all the social awkwardness
566540	571660	is earned rather than diagnosed, which is the only reason I've said, I don't have aspergers
571660	575340	on all the various shows where I have defended not having aspergers.
575340	577900	So what do you have?
577900	584180	I'd like to say a great personality and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is treated
584180	586180	through medication.
586180	587180	What are you, what, Ritalin?
587180	588180	Okay.
588180	589180	Yeah.
589180	590180	Can I have some?
590180	591180	Yeah, sure.
591180	592180	We'll talk later.
592180	596900	I'm not going to- this is going to be the first live drug deal via podcast.
596900	601700	You know, season two of Community, heard of it, Adderall, baby.
601700	602700	Yeah.
602700	606220	Whoo, chewing it like candy.
606220	607980	It's the candy that lets you focus.
607980	609780	I can say it now.
609780	611820	Let that go down for my bio pick.
611820	613140	That was the Johnny Cashier.
613140	617340	I don't think you're a fool on anybody.
617340	618340	Holy smokes.
618340	620940	Dan, have a seat.
620940	621940	Have a seat?
621940	622940	Yeah.
622940	623940	Let this guy take off.
623940	626940	Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Goldberg.
626940	627940	Goldberg Town.
627940	636340	It's time for us, the regular segment of Harman Town called Goldbergia.
636340	637340	Goldberg.
637340	645460	No one online got any of that.
645460	648300	They should have put their money on the barrel, put it in the incinerator.
648300	657060	So it's Wednesday night, a few weeks ago, I'm killing it, I'm killing it in the exposition.
657060	659220	I'm killing it.
659220	665860	I go down to House of Pies for a meetup.com inspired game of cards against humanity and
665860	666860	pies.
666860	670500	I met the creators of that game and they're going to love that cheap plug.
670500	673860	Sorry, I didn't mean to derail, dude.
673860	674860	It's fair enough.
674860	675860	No, it's a converse.
675860	676860	I'm not an oddity.
676860	678860	I'm a weirdo.
678860	682180	You can touch the display animal or whatever this is.
682180	683180	Nobody feels sorry for you.
683180	684180	Thank God.
684180	687300	Because that would take a long time.
687300	692380	So I go over to the drawing room, House of Pies does not serve liquor, as well they shouldn't.
692380	707460	Go over there and I see Jeff chatting with our dear friend Kate and the cool, yes, please.
707460	713540	Jeff went to get a drink for himself and Adam, who doesn't have Asperger's.
713540	724740	Uh, at all, uh, somehow interpreted Jeff getting a drink as a, as an offer, offer to get him
724740	725740	a drink.
725740	726740	Oh, you've Tyler parry eyes.
726740	727740	Did now.
727740	728740	Oh my God.
728740	729740	Thank you.
729740	730740	Hope.
730740	731740	All right.
731740	741100	So you're at House of Pies and I was like, I need to drink some liquor to, to balance
741100	745580	out the, the good decisions I've been making all night, playing four hours of an offensive
745580	746860	card game.
746860	747860	Go over there.
747860	752220	I meet Jeff, meet some of our good friends over there and it's his birthday.
752220	755460	Technically, it was here birthday celebration, pre-birthday.
755460	760540	And you, there was a coolish British guy I've ever half talked to because couldn't really
760540	763380	hear much of anything at the bar.
763380	767940	I think he introduced himself and said, my name is like, that's great.
767940	773860	I'll wait until someone uses it in conversation later, which never happened.
773860	779420	So after this is the thing, this is the angle you're playing where you, you, you didn't know
779420	781340	it was Eric Idol the whole night.
781340	784100	I, I, I, which is that looks bad on me.
784100	785660	I'll admit that was a mistake.
785660	787540	I think it's, I don't think it's true.
787540	788540	I know.
788540	790740	I just thought you were there.
790740	795620	Did it seem like I knew what was, it never seems like, you know, what's going on.
795620	796620	Oh yeah.
796620	800460	You seemed so irrational in polite, like you couldn't pick up on social cues.
800460	807220	So you must not have known who I was or like, we're just being yourself in a meeting Eric
807220	808220	Idol.
808220	809220	Yeah.
809220	811460	At one point you pulled out your phone and started reading at the top of your lungs an
811460	814340	anti-war poem off of your phone.
814340	820020	One it was a loud slam poetry voice to I am normally loud anyway.
820020	821020	So that's hard to distinguish.
822020	823020	I don't like that.
823020	824020	I know.
824020	827540	He, I remember looking over at Eric, I know he had his head bowed and he was just nodding
827540	828540	listening to it.
828540	833780	Like he was in a beat, like a poetry slab and so I think that one of the riddles also liked
833780	834780	that poem.
834780	839860	So I would like to think that my 10 year old self could, could randomly look through a
839860	844100	portal and see me sitting in a living room with a guy on a velvet couch, looking at
844100	850060	a, at a hologram phone going, but my war is not your war brother.
850700	854860	It's screaming at the top of his lungs with Eric Idol nodding his head in the corner.
854860	860460	That's the only glimpse you get of your 39 year old life, Dan Harmon.
860460	863300	You know who the riddles are, but you don't know Eric Idol.
863300	865620	I would recognize him much more.
865620	871500	I mean, it was a, it was a mistake on my part, but to think all older Englishmen look like
871500	873780	Eric Idol is equally biased.
873860	880460	I think that you, that, that, that when I started laughing at you, because you asked
880460	883300	him for his card, I said, he doesn't have a card.
883300	884300	He's Eric Idol.
884300	885300	Leave him alone.
885300	886300	That's when I knew him as Eric Idol.
886300	887300	If you had not said that, I would know.
887300	893420	And then you went, oh, oh, I, I, not, not by virtue of a, of a, of a natural ability
893420	898660	to, to, to, to, uh, pick up on it through empathy, but now because it's been pronounced,
898660	900700	I've, I've misstepped.
900700	902660	And then you texted Aaron and said, sorry about that.
902660	904300	I didn't know he was Eric Idol all night.
904300	906300	I'm going to go ahead and call.
906300	913380	My theory is that that's a little damage control, uh, Goldbergian horseshittery and, and, and,
913380	918020	and everyone's going, oh, Adam Goldberg's anything if not honest, uh, like, like he's,
918020	919020	he's an honest person.
919020	924060	Uh, you, you got Aaron's phone number so you could send her that, that, that, that text
924060	929900	to the way you got, the way you got her phone number was by saying, Hey, Aaron, I was there
929900	930900	when you did this.
931140	932820	Hey, Aaron, I lost my phone.
932820	933820	My phone broke.
933820	934820	I didn't go.
934820	936140	What was your number again?
936140	937140	And she gave it to you.
937140	941900	And then we walked away and she's like, he never had my number you're both true.
941900	942900	Both true.
942900	943900	You're a diabolical.
943900	946620	And I lost my phone.
946620	947620	You're diabolical.
947620	952620	Hey, I think, I think it's just been a long con.
952620	957340	This whole, this whole personality thing that you've been faking just as slowly take over
957340	959220	harm in town.
959220	961620	He's not an unintelligent man, obviously.
961620	962620	We know that.
962620	967140	Who's to say he's not evil like he could be, he could be, we don't know.
967140	968140	We don't know.
968140	969140	He's out on Adam Goldberg.
969140	974180	I have no rejoinder to defend myself from the accusation of being scheming and evil,
974180	979860	but I'd like to defend and say that your, your accusation of me being competent is far
979860	980860	afield.
980860	987300	What, you were competent in making me make you a drink.
987300	990740	I couldn't, I thought I thought you were, I can't, you're much taller than me.
990740	994820	I don't know if you can tell in podcast land, Jeff has about three or four vertical feet
994820	995820	on me.
995820	1005300	And horizontal, if you know what I'm talking about, you have a three foot day, three foot
1005300	1006300	four inches.
1006300	1010780	You just look like a T square.
1010780	1018820	Adam, as long as you're up here, the last time you were up on stage, where I was in
1018820	1022820	a blackout drunk, I heard the recording of it and I have some questions including what's
1022820	1023900	wrong with your spine.
1023900	1024900	You kept mentioning.
1024900	1025900	Yeah.
1025900	1026900	That's just musky.
1026900	1030580	That's a mixture of long-term muscular dystrophy, which I'm going to fall victim to in 30 years
1030580	1032380	and a little bit of scoliosis.
1032380	1035020	What do you, I didn't know you could make.
1035020	1036820	You're not allowed to pity me.
1036820	1037820	That's the rule.
1037820	1038820	That's why the rule.
1038820	1039820	We fucking are.
1039820	1043620	Well, how does muscular dystrophy work?
1043620	1050500	A muscular dystrophy is a process where eventually you lose nerve tissue, you lose muscle tissue
1050500	1052380	in a way that it doesn't regenerate.
1052380	1055820	So eventually you lose a lot of lower body function.
1055820	1058860	In severe cases, you just can't use your muscles.
1058860	1063180	It's like, so you know that you have it, but I know that it's hereditary and my dad has
1063180	1064180	it pretty bad.
1064180	1066260	Oh, so you don't, it's in the cards.
1066260	1073220	Is it a thing that you, it comes on like diabetes, like you don't have it now, but you're just
1073220	1074580	saying you're highly at risk for it.
1074580	1079340	I'm at risk for it and that in like the, just, you know, being in front of a monitor for
1079340	1086060	the past 14 years and then there's just scoliosis thrown into boot, like a little garnish.
1086060	1089980	I got those, the real, you know, the two seven off suit.
1089980	1093380	Just to make sure your spine doesn't make it through the gauntlet.
1093380	1098940	It looks like a question mark and the question is how did Adam miss that social cue?
1098940	1105860	Yeah, there could be a little show about you called what's up with Adam and you could be
1105860	1111340	the question mark at the end of the title segment.
1111340	1116100	You're leaning up against the M and Adam and kind of like, I don't know you tell me Adam's
1116100	1117300	spine is so crooked.
1117300	1124180	That makes Jeff look straight.
1124180	1128140	That's forgetting 50 retweets for a picture of me doing this and saying it's the face of
1128140	1133620	Asperger's leading my brother to call me furiously.
1133620	1135300	Is that guy Jeff bullying you?
1135300	1136740	I didn't say I can take him.
1136740	1137740	I didn't.
1137740	1140540	I did not say it was the face of Asperger's.
1140540	1143180	I said it was a Harmon town Asperger's fight or something like that.
1143180	1144180	No, I read.
1144180	1149620	It's not like I haven't reread it with anger and evil.
1149620	1150620	I'm evil.
1150620	1151620	I was a twist.
1151620	1154380	I'm sorry if I bullied you.
1154380	1160900	I was like, oh, this guy who is cool, I know he's Eric Idle and I just, I tried to play
1160900	1161900	it off.
1161900	1162900	Cool.
1162900	1167380	But as we walked down to the cab where he was taking a cab, good sentence construction
1167380	1168380	there.
1168380	1172180	I said, Oh, I meant did you have a birthday card for Jeff whose birthday is coming up?
1172180	1178500	Why do you say birthday like Will Smith?
1178500	1182180	You spell it with an F instead of a th like welcome to earth.
1182180	1183180	Yeah.
1183180	1184180	Welcome to birth.
1184180	1185180	Welcome to birth.
1185180	1187060	You don't, you don't have a speech impediment.
1187060	1188060	You just say birthday.
1188060	1189060	I used to.
1189060	1190060	I worked that one out.
1190060	1192500	I used to not be able to tell the difference between specific and pathetic.
1192500	1194900	It was, uh, it was terrible.
1194900	1195900	What did you say?
1195900	1199860	Let me think of a word with th in it and say, I won't mispronounce it.
1199860	1200860	I can't.
1200860	1201860	I can't even say.
1201860	1206820	But don't, don't get me started on like theory and the whack now that I'm highly aware of
1206820	1207820	it.
1207820	1208820	And I'm sorry.
1208820	1209820	I interrupted you.
1209820	1210820	No, no, no.
1210820	1211820	It's fine.
1211820	1212820	This is, we're having a good time.
1212820	1216740	I feel like, uh, has anybody ever seen the movie, the music man or the kid with, I feel
1216740	1219540	like this is a weird deleted scene.
1219540	1225900	We just hang out with the, what's your deal?
1225900	1231140	Are you going to sing Gary and we're learning so much about your, thanks for making the
1231140	1232140	point.
1232140	1233140	All right.
1233140	1235060	Well, uh, that's, that's just the clarification of the story.
1235060	1236740	I'm going to go sit over yonder.
1236740	1237740	All right.
1237740	1246780	It's Adam, Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1246780	1254340	An unremarkable name for a very remarkable young lad with a, with a, with a, with a beset
1254340	1260220	upon spine according to him, uh, we should bring up our guests, we should bring up our
1260220	1261220	guests pretty soon.
1261220	1262220	All right.
1262220	1264940	So let's start off by welcoming back our dungeon master, Spencer, everybody about it.
1264940	1265940	Oh yeah.
1265940	1266940	Let's bring him up.
1266940	1274440	For those of you, uh, just tuning in, we are well into a campaign of Dungeons and Dragons
1274440	1279220	and we have a, uh, the dungeon master to the stars, Spencer, what's your last name, Spencer?
1279220	1280220	Crittenden.
1280220	1281220	Crittenden.
1281220	1282220	Spencer.
1282220	1283220	Just go with Spencer.
1283220	1284220	It's fine.
1284220	1285220	Spencer.
1285220	1286220	That seems like, that seems like.
1286220	1287220	I didn't choose it.
1287220	1293260	It's like young Chevy Chase's bit, like I'm making up a name, Crittenden, like it's just
1293260	1294260	trailing off.
1294260	1296140	Well, we have a special, we have a special treat tonight.
1296140	1298340	We have a guest in the house tonight.
1298340	1299340	Yeah.
1299340	1300340	Yeah.
1300340	1303820	We're going to, we're going to have him come up and play, play, play D and D with us.
1303820	1306700	Airport security.
1306700	1308220	Just a, just a, just a quick thing.
1308220	1311980	Cause I, I've been traveling a lot lately and we were going through the airport security
1311980	1312980	everybody.
1312980	1313980	North Carolina.
1314980	1315980	Here's the thing.
1315980	1316980	Okay.
1316980	1317980	Security.
1317980	1321580	You go through, you take off your shoes, take off your belt, you put your wallet in
1321580	1322580	the thing.
1322580	1323580	You got everything.
1323580	1324580	You got everything in your pocket.
1324580	1328060	You put it all in your bag, your laptop, putting the separate thing, put the shoes, the thing.
1328060	1329540	You go through the thing.
1329540	1333780	And then the only thing that I don't understand about it is at the very end, when you're,
1333780	1336900	when you're, the things come out in the conveyor belt, you're, you're through the whole thing.
1336900	1341460	And then you're grabbing your belt and your shoes and your, there's always some dick that's
1341460	1343620	like, like, like, come on people.
1343620	1344620	You got it.
1344620	1345620	You got to keep it moving.
1345620	1350300	Like, like, like always, I get so fucking mad because you know, you can't, you can't
1350300	1353700	like tell them what a dick they're being because it's, you know, they'll just arrest you.
1353700	1354700	You're a terrorist.
1354700	1358900	If you go, you're a dick, like, what, why, what are you, like, why are they surprised?
1358900	1361140	They're the, it was expedience.
1361140	1362140	Your goal.
1362140	1363820	Now you just fucking, what are you talking about?
1363820	1364820	I'm half naked.
1364820	1366540	I got all my shit in the fucking thing.
1366540	1368020	You're at whoa, what's going on?
1368020	1370180	Why is everything so slow around here?
1370180	1373180	Cause of you, are you crazy?
1373740	1375260	You made me take my shoes off.
1375260	1377260	I want to murder you.
1377260	1380260	I'm not even allowed to say it.
1380260	1381260	Go to court.
1381260	1382860	They'll come arrest you.
1382860	1386340	A guy tweeted that he was going to blow up an airport and they went to his house and
1386340	1390100	are like, cause he was at the airport when he tweeted it, but then they like had to figure
1390100	1394060	out who he was and they went to his house and like, there's a hockey referee just got
1394060	1398620	busted for making that like, oh, I got a bomb and they put me, he's in jail.
1398620	1399620	Fuck you.
1399620	1400620	Fuck you, man.
1400620	1401620	Fuck you.
1401620	1405820	The reason why it's illegal to joke that you have a bomb, I guess is so that you can't
1405820	1407620	kind of like Heath Ledger joker it.
1407620	1409860	Like walk into an airport and go like, I have a bomb, I have a bomb.
1409860	1413140	They just don't want to, you know, you can't, okay, fine.
1413140	1418340	So you can't, you can't fuck around with that kind of conversation in an airport because
1418340	1423300	it's a, it'll throw a monkey wrench into the TSA's works.
1423300	1430980	Not a government agency, private company, nothing in the constitution about any of this
1430980	1431980	going on.
1431980	1439020	Uh, uh, uh, by the way, do we really think that Al Qaeda is, uh, is going like, all right,
1439020	1440900	good job on nine 11.
1440900	1446980	Let's do another one, another nine 11, they'll never see that coming.
1446980	1447980	How do we do it?
1447980	1449860	Let's do nine 12.
1449860	1450860	They're not retarded.
1450860	1451860	I'm sorry.
1451860	1452860	Retarded people.
1452860	1455380	My sister's retarded.
1455380	1465020	The Al Qaeda is retarded and by that I mean that they are capable of anything.
1465020	1466020	Nice save.
1466020	1472940	But I, but I also don't want to go to Guantanamo Bay for saying that it gets really confusing.
1472940	1477100	Political correctness merged with the new Patriot act, uh, you're, you're, you're in
1477100	1478100	Guantanamo Bay.
1478100	1479100	Why are you here?
1479100	1484300	I said Al Qaeda was retarded, but, but that's, no, you don't understand.
1484300	1486420	Retarded people are special.
1486420	1487420	They're courageous.
1487420	1489420	They can do anything.
1489420	1492060	You're not allowed to say that about a terrorist.
1492060	1493060	They're cowards.
1493060	1497100	They are jealous of our way of life.
1497100	1503420	They accidentally knocked down the two biggest buildings in the world, uh, with a box cutter.
1503420	1506100	They're, uh, they're, they're completely ineffective.
1506100	1507900	They should be totally ignored.
1507900	1516380	Uh, please welcome to the stage, Steve Agee.
1516380	1518060	I tried to earlier, man.
1518060	1519460	I tried to.
1519460	1522300	I don't like, I am a control freak.
1522300	1523980	I like, I like to bring the guests up.
1523980	1524980	All right.
1524980	1525980	That's okay.
1525980	1526980	So you hate flying, right?
1526980	1530420	You kind of Goldberg to me a little bit.
1530420	1531420	It's our friends.
1531420	1532420	Steve Agee.
1532420	1533420	Do you have any thoughts about the airport?
1533420	1534420	Oh my God.
1534420	1537260	Why do they call it flying more like waiting to fly?
1537260	1538260	Am I right?
1538260	1551740	We discovered a thing at the, uh, yesterday's show at this podcast festival, or Agee does
1551740	1556940	hack a standup and then Jeff just plays a music cue after each joke and it's pretty
1556940	1557940	fun.
1557940	1558940	Let's try it out.
1558940	1559940	Let's try it out.
1559940	1561940	Uh, how about this heat?
1561940	1569300	Uh, I was masturbating yesterday and shot a load of sweat.
1569300	1583860	It's, it's, it's like, uh, it's like laughing pictures coming out of little doors in a,
1583860	1588100	you don't know until it comes out groovy Dan do a joke now about the airport security.
1588100	1589140	Oh Jesus.
1589140	1609420	These guys, uh, you know, uh, they, uh, they don't serve peanuts, you know, anymore.
1609420	1613580	I was on a flight and they didn't even serve food and I noticed in my, my seat in front
1613580	1615380	of me, they didn't even have barf bags.
1615380	1616380	I was like, why not?
1616380	1626260	Barf bags are like, well, we don't serve food anymore.
1626260	1634300	We'll be right back.
1634300	1636900	That's some heavy dancing going on over there.
1636900	1638540	I like just gentle leg kicks.
1638540	1645140	Like I just, uh, this is a new thing I like doing, uh, so Steve, you're going to play
1645140	1646420	Dungeons and Dragons with us.
1646420	1647420	I'd love to try.
1647420	1648420	All right.
1648420	1649420	Where are you?
1649420	1650420	Have you ever played before?
1650420	1651420	Never.
1651420	1653300	Nor have I until, uh, until this campaign.
1653300	1654300	Yeah.
1654300	1656980	Well, we've become really good at it.
1656980	1662340	I really, honestly, it's embarrassing to say, but the last show that we did, uh, uh, where
1662340	1665660	proofs came up and we played D and D again, there was, there's been a show since then,
1665660	1670860	but the last that we didn't play D and D in the last game or the last show, right?
1670860	1671860	I don't think so.
1671860	1672860	Yeah.
1673100	1681940	Uh, cause Spencer had, uh, he had a, a, a, a beard, uh, opening to, uh, speak at.
1681940	1682940	Congratulations.
1682940	1683940	By the way.
1683940	1684940	It's a huge honor.
1684940	1685940	Thank you.
1685940	1686940	Thank you.
1686940	1692020	So there was a new beard opening, uh, uh, across town and there's, uh, he had to, uh,
1692020	1698860	cut the ribbon with, uh, his beard scissors.
1699860	1703660	It's, it's something that it's something that he thought he'd be on time because they
1703660	1708820	usually go very fast because as you know, the beard scissors are very sharp because
1708820	1712780	they're, they're not, they're not used for anything but cutting ribbons or they don't
1712780	1713780	cut their beards with them.
1713780	1714780	No.
1714780	1715780	Otherwise you wouldn't have a beard.
1715780	1716780	Is that me?
1716780	1717780	Aaron's calling me.
1717780	1718780	What?
1718780	1725900	Oh, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron's calling and texting, wondering if her character's going to be in
1725900	1728900	this game of fetching a dragon.
1728900	1729900	Wow.
1729900	1732900	For the sec, she called you from the second row.
1732900	1733900	Yeah.
1733900	1734900	Yeah.
1734900	1740900	Uh, that's, that's an argument for turning your phone off during a show.
1740900	1741900	All right.
1741900	1744900	But then how would we have known that Aaron wanted to be on stage?
1744900	1745900	Uh, yeah.
1745900	1752540	What are we supposed to just guess that you could knock me over with a feather right now.
1752540	1755900	For heroes had been camping in the Connie forest.
1755900	1759780	As they awoke, they realized their unicorn compatriot had vanished.
1759780	1764660	Heading deeper into the forest, tensions ran high without the soothing relief of Tylenol
1764660	1766340	with codeine.
1766340	1770660	In a fit of confusion and self-doubt, Sharpie left his friends and got all reflective and
1770660	1773020	deep while looking into a lake.
1773020	1778180	Resolving to confront his daddy issues after ending the dark influence of Admiral Darkstar,
1778180	1781820	Sharpie and Quark renewed their adventurers pact and with a new sense of confidence and
1781820	1784540	purpose plunged into the heart of the forest of shadows.
1784540	1788580	This is very, I wish I had this in my regular life.
1788580	1792940	As I get older, I could just consult with you each day.
1792940	1794860	What happened yesterday, Spencer?
1794860	1799500	Dan Harmon went to the bank because he needed to get a cashier's receipt for a sex toy.
1799500	1801500	A cashier's receipt?
1801500	1802500	What?
1802500	1805780	What are you talking about, Spencer?
1805780	1806780	I don't know.
1806780	1810820	I just, I blazed a doobie in the parking lot.
1811820	1815820	A beard doobie?
1815820	1816820	I don't know.
1816820	1817820	Shut up, Dan.
1817820	1819820	Just shut up.
1819820	1820820	Dan Harmon.
1820820	1821820	Shut up.
1823820	1825820	All right, now talk.
1826820	1828820	Sorry.
1828820	1831820	Really Goldberg-ing it up here, man.
1833820	1834820	All right, so that's...
1834820	1835820	You want your characters?
1835820	1836820	Yeah, yeah.
1836820	1839820	Let's get our characters in hand.
1839820	1840820	Dennis from Rockford, Illinois.
1840820	1841820	How's it going?
1841820	1842820	All right.
1842820	1843820	Are you enjoying the show?
1843820	1844820	Love it.
1844820	1845820	Thank you.
1845820	1846820	You said your girlfriend didn't want to come with you, right?
1846820	1847820	She's out of work.
1847820	1850820	Oh, she didn't come with you to L.A.?
1850820	1851820	Right.
1852820	1854820	This is Jeff.
1854820	1855820	Hey, Dan.
1855820	1858820	You're doing great up there, man.
1858820	1861820	Thanks, buddy.
1861820	1864820	Turn your fucking phone off.
1865820	1866820	Hello?
1866820	1868820	I put it on speaker.
1868820	1872820	I thought it would get weird, like an infinity mirror.
1872820	1874820	Let's try it.
1875820	1877820	This is like the early days of...
1877820	1878820	Shit, now Aaron's calling.
1878820	1879820	Wait.
1879820	1880820	Oh, sorry.
1880820	1881820	I have Aaron on the other line.
1881820	1882820	Oh, shit.
1882820	1883820	Hello, Aaron?
1883820	1885820	No, this is me.
1885820	1886820	Oh.
1886820	1888820	Wait, let me switch over.
1888820	1889820	Aaron?
1889820	1890820	Hello, Aaron.
1890820	1891820	Yeah.
1891820	1892820	Can you hold on?
1892820	1893820	I have Jeff on the other line.
1893820	1895820	I'm going to try to merge the calls.
1895820	1896820	Okay.
1897820	1899820	Steve, give me a call with you.
1899820	1900820	Hello?
1900820	1901820	Aaron?
1903820	1904820	Hello?
1904820	1905820	Hi.
1905820	1906820	How you guys doing?
1906820	1907820	How you guys doing?
1907820	1908820	Yeah.
1908820	1909820	Are we...
1909820	1910820	Are we...
1910820	1911820	Are we...
1912820	1915820	If Alexander Graham Bell had seen this day coming...
1915820	1916820	Wait, hang on.
1916820	1917820	Hang on.
1917820	1918820	I got Steve Angie coming in here.
1918820	1919820	Hold on a second.
1920820	1921820	Hello?
1921820	1924820	Hey, Jeff, what are you guys doing over there?
1925820	1928820	We're doing the stupidest bit of all time.
1930820	1931820	Oh, yeah.
1931820	1932820	I can see it.
1933820	1935820	Are we on the same call?
1935820	1936820	Yeah.
1936820	1937820	Wait.
1939820	1944820	Hey, you guys, I have a bit for you from my Evernote bit file for Harmontown.
1949820	1950820	Hold on a second.
1950820	1953820	Did you guys know that in high school...
1955820	1958820	Famous Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger...
1960820	1963820	His prom date left with a veterinarian.
1969820	1970820	Adam?
1970820	1971820	Adam, you like that?
1974820	1976820	I'm just going to come on, Steve.
1976820	1978820	My character's not that.
1978820	1979820	No, that's cool.
1981820	1982820	All right.
1982820	1983820	Come on up.
1983820	1984820	All right.
1984820	1985820	Aaron McGathey.
1985820	1986820	Wow.
1988820	1992820	In Adam Goldbergian fashion, just storm the stage whenever you want, everybody.
1992820	1993820	Just come on up.
1994820	1999820	You know, we should just turn the show around and we'll be the audience.
2000820	2004820	I am usually the one that is the most entertained at these shows.
2004820	2006820	I should be called the audience.
2008820	2010820	That was bullshit, right?
2010820	2011820	The phone thing?
2011820	2012820	We tried it.
2012820	2013820	Did it work?
2013820	2014820	What do you mean?
2014820	2015820	I don't know.
2015820	2016820	Did that pay off?
2016820	2017820	Was that good?
2017820	2018820	I don't know.
2018820	2020820	I mean, it was a concept.
2020820	2021820	It was certainly worth trying.
2021820	2025820	We don't want to not go to the moon and not have tried that.
2025820	2028820	Yeah, we need to know how things work when we get up there.
2029820	2031820	If you're on one call, can someone call you?
2031820	2033820	Yeah, we might have had a tiger by the tail right there.
2033820	2034820	We don't know.
2035820	2037820	Talk about it more.
2038820	2040820	I think it brought you up here, Cocksucker.
2041820	2042820	Did you call her Cocksucker?
2042820	2043820	I did.
2047820	2048820	I don't know.
2048820	2050820	I was going to say thank you and then I gross myself out.
2051820	2052820	One step ahead of you.
2058820	2059820	Yeah, Schrodinger.
2059820	2060820	Get it?
2060820	2061820	Because he's famous for...
2061820	2062820	The cat.
2062820	2063820	Yeah, he could have put anything in that box.
2063820	2068820	You know that at one point some girl he liked married a veterinarian or something.
2068820	2069820	That's all I'm saying.
2069820	2075820	He's like, I'm going to use my physics powers to hold a cat's life in the palm of my hand
2075820	2076820	for all of eternity.
2077820	2078820	Cats 101?
2080820	2083820	Well, do we start playing Dungeons and Dragons now?
2083820	2085820	The thick, tall trees.
2087820	2092820	The thick, tall trees give way to spindly, gnarled brambles and the packed dirt and loam
2092820	2095820	of the forest fade into muddy swamps as you follow the path.
2096820	2098820	Deep within dark stars set desecration.
2099820	2100820	You'd embark.
2100820	2101820	That was stupid.
2102820	2108820	The sounds of wildlife die off and all is quiet save an occasional clacking rustle
2108820	2110820	and the ripples of water lapping at rotting tree trunks.
2111820	2112820	Sharpie.
2112820	2113820	Yes, Quark?
2113820	2114820	How are you?
2114820	2115820	It's been a couple of weeks.
2115820	2116820	Yeah.
2116820	2117820	Well, I mean, you know...
2117820	2118820	It's been minutes.
2118820	2119820	Socially, yeah.
2119820	2120820	A couple of minutes.
2120820	2123820	It seems like weeks since I knew what the hell was going on.
2123820	2124820	Yeah.
2124820	2126820	When you're walking, is this described?
2127820	2129820	You know, time can fly.
2129820	2130820	Right.
2131820	2132820	What is...
2132820	2134820	Refresh my memory on Admiral Darkstar?
2134820	2135820	He's an...
2137820	2138820	Admiral Darkstar is off.
2139820	2142820	My voice trails off as Spencer's VO comes in.
2142820	2147820	The corrupting influence of Admiral Darkstar and his dark cult have wrought in terrible
2147820	2151820	destruction on the forest, transforming it into the forest of shadows.
2151820	2156820	You hope to assault his ziggurat in hopes of dethroning him and ending his dark.
2156820	2157820	Sharpie, I know that...
2157820	2162820	I know what a ziggurat is, but just for everybody else that doesn't know what a ziggurat is.
2163820	2164820	Just refresh.
2164820	2169820	A ziggurat is a pyramidal temple used for the worship of ancient cultures.
2169820	2170820	Thanks, Sharpie.
2171820	2172820	No problem.
2173820	2175820	All right, I examine my surroundings, Spencer.
2175820	2180820	You see a wooden sign hanging from a blackened husk of a tree standing in the middle of the
2180820	2181820	muddy path.
2181820	2184820	It is adorned with a black skull and a black star.
2185820	2188820	Under the sign, you see a pile of corpses.
2188820	2189820	But wait.
2189820	2191820	We see the sign first before the corpse...
2191820	2192820	You love signs.
2192820	2194820	Not too bothered by that.
2195820	2201820	I saw the sign, and it opened up my eye, and I saw the sign.
2201820	2202820	Full circle.
2203820	2204820	All right, yeah.
2204820	2207820	Adam Goldberg's freaking out right now because so many dots are being connected.
2208820	2210820	A stirring comes within the corpses.
2210820	2211820	Don't bully him, then.
2211820	2213820	It may be a survivor.
2214820	2217820	He extricates himself from the pile of corpses and stands.
2217820	2222820	He's wearing plate armor and holding the golden seal of Pelor.
2222820	2223820	Speak, survivor!
2224820	2225820	That's you.
2225820	2225820	
2225820	2226820	Yeah, go for it.
2227820	2229820	Hey, I'm Marcus Goldberg.
2230820	2231820	I'm sorry.
2231820	2232820	I'm...
2232820	2233820	Goldbright.
2235820	2236820	I'm a Jew.
2238820	2239820	A magical Jew.
2239820	2240820	A human Jew.
2243820	2244820	Please help me.
2245820	2246820	I mean, don't help me with being Jewish.
2247820	2249820	I'm laying in a pile of corpses.
2249820	2250820	Help me.
2251820	2252820	Do you want us to sit shiv?
2256820	2258820	It's a Jewish reference.
2259820	2261820	Oh, it's Morris, not Marcus.
2261820	2262820	Morris Goldbright.
2264820	2265820	Morris Goldbright.
2266820	2267820	Sterling Newfriend.
2267820	2269820	I lift him with my great strength.
2270820	2271820	And I hug him.
2272820	2273820	I'm lifting him.
2273820	2274820	You hug him successfully.
2276820	2277820	How do you feel about that?
2278820	2281820	What's with your overzealous friend here, fellas?
2282820	2283820	You're asking me?
2286820	2287820	Wow.
2287820	2292820	Have you seen Admiral Darkstar or any of his minions?
2293820	2294820	Yeah.
2295820	2299820	They're the ones that caused all this bullshit that I'm laying here in.
2301820	2305820	How is it, my friend, Morris Goldbright?
2306820	2307820	Yep.
2308820	2311820	How is it that you are the lone survivor of this travesty?
2312820	2316820	I'm a coward and I hid beneath the bodies for safety.
2316820	2325820	I took my best friend and laid his corpse over me.
2326820	2329820	Who's laughing now, the sole survivor?
2330820	2334820	Well, it was cowardly of you to do that, but so brave to tell us.
2335820	2338820	Surely you would like to join us in avenging the death of your friends.
2339820	2342820	I'll stand behind you, of course.
2343820	2345820	Yes, I would like to help avenge.
2345820	2348820	We're going to get so many letters from synagogues.
2349820	2358820	Mr. Harmon, could your cowardly Jewish character have participated a little?
2359820	2360820	Whatever.
2361820	2362820	Maybe he redeems himself.
2362820	2363820	Yeah, well, we don't know.
2363820	2368820	I'm just keeping my eye on that as a potential special interest group disaster.
2370820	2372820	You notice there's been no black people on this adventure.
2373820	2375820	By the way, that's your own perception.
2376820	2377820	I never mentioned race.
2377820	2379820	If you read into that, that's not me.
2381820	2383820	That's the weirdest applause ever.
2384820	2385820	Dungeon snap.
2388820	2393820	My character is male and I've always thought of him as black.
2395820	2396820	All right, well, that sounds like a bit.
2396820	2397820	It's not a bit.
2397820	2400820	This stuff wouldn't come to light if I didn't bring it up, but then I get crucified.
2401820	2404820	By the way, I thought this said level two hymen.
2408820	2409820	But it doesn't.
2410820	2412820	It's so much less breakable than a level one.
2417820	2418820	I have a level two hymen.
2419820	2420820	True story, I still have my hymen.
2421820	2422820	Do you know that?
2422820	2423820	Yeah, I know.
2423820	2426820	Its armor class is impenetrable.
2426820	2428820	My vorpal dick can't even get through it.
2431820	2433820	The stick is a button.
2434820	2436820	That's a dick that's not...
2437820	2439820	I was yaffing in a way that wasn't an insult.
2439820	2440820	I'm kidding.
2440820	2446820	It's like a horse was a log and then that log was blessed by God.
2446820	2447820	That's a dance dick.
2449820	2450820	I'm sorry.
2450820	2452820	I examine the paths around us.
2453820	2462820	Past the blackened tree, you see a massive construction of sticks, mud, and bones with a gated graveyard to the south.
2462820	2464820	This is dark star ziggurat.
2464820	2470820	Past the wrought iron fence of the graveyard, you see figures cloaked in black digging with shovels and hauling corpses.
2470820	2474820	You see an ornate wooden door entering into the ziggurat.
2474820	2478820	Past the north wall, you see the glow of perhaps a fire.
2479820	2480820	Ziggurat?
2483820	2484820	We're out of there.
2484820	2485820	Vision cones?
2485820	2487820	Yeah, you're like peering behind this tree.
2487820	2488820	You're pretty far off.
2488820	2489820	They haven't noticed you.
2489820	2491820	They're inside a fenced area.
2491820	2494820	I know this isn't in my nature, but I'm recommending we hide.
2495820	2496820	You always recommend that.
2496820	2497820	Oh, all right.
2497820	2498820	Thank you.
2498820	2499820	I second that.
2501820	2504820	I know where there's a pile of corpses we can hide under, you guys.
2508820	2509820	Morris!
2509820	2510820	Morris Goldbrite!
2511820	2515820	Dress yourself in corpses and move slowly closer to it so they won't know what it is.
2516820	2520820	Go hide yourself in a pile of corpses and examine the gate.
2520820	2521820	You know, right?
2523820	2524820	What?
2525820	2532820	It's like when you dress like a bush and you slowly move closer to something.
2532820	2533820	Right, but you want it to be...
2533820	2535820	And it's a cemetery, so it's natural.
2535820	2537820	Yeah, it's a pile of bodies.
2537820	2538820	They won't think anything about it.
2539820	2540820	But the bodies will be moving.
2541820	2542820	Yeah, but only when they're not looking.
2543820	2544820	Does he have super strengths?
2546820	2547820	Why don't you do this?
2548820	2549820	Okay.
2549820	2556820	I clad myself with all of its corpses and slowly, in a red light, green light fashion,
2556820	2560820	move a camouflage towards the gates of the cemetery.
2561820	2562820	I don't understand.
2564820	2565820	I want to get a closer look.
2566820	2572820	You hide yourself into the pile of bodies and manage to shift it ever slowly towards the gates of the cemetery.
2575820	2579820	Approaching the front gate, you notice that no one has taken notice of you.
2579820	2580820	See?
2580820	2581820	Guys, get over here!
2583820	2588820	I grab some bodies and I put them on my body.
2590820	2591820	And I do the same.
2592820	2593820	Except I do it cooler.
2596820	2602820	You manage to put one body on top of your own and rush over towards...
2603820	2610820	I say this is one of those situations, like in a movie, where, you know, like, if we can take one of these guys out, you know, we take their robes.
2610820	2613820	Am I close enough to see these dark figures and robes?
2613820	2614820	You can see them.
2614820	2617820	They seem unusually pale and thin.
2618820	2619820	Can you...
2619820	2620820	Are you...
2620820	2624820	Dan, don't you have to detect evil or detect magic or some kind of thing like that?
2624820	2626820	Yeah, but we know they're evil and magic.
2627820	2628820	That's metagaming.
2628820	2629820	You don't know that.
2629820	2631820	It could just be in a goth band.
2634820	2635820	An alternative lifestyle.
2636820	2638820	I'm trying to look for, like, a charm spell or something.
2639820	2643820	I, apropos of nothing, give Quirk a present.
2644820	2645820	What present?
2646820	2649820	It's a bow that is shaped like his face.
2649820	2655820	I took tea and I stained fabric with a shadow.
2656820	2657820	Quirk falls asleep.
2658820	2659820	You don't have any fabric.
2660820	2662820	You can get some at the store later.
2663820	2665820	What are these guys doing? They're digging or...?
2665820	2667820	They're digging and hauling corpses into the ziggurat.
2668820	2677820	Are there any of them that are away from the larger amount of them that are vulnerable to some kind of, like, a little ambush, a little subterfuge, a little hoke and poke?
2679820	2682820	You see one about five foot off of a hole in the fence.
2682820	2685820	You might be able to dash over there and take him out before anyone notices.
2686820	2688820	I'm gonna try to cast sleep.
2689820	2693820	Is the sleep spell, is that a ranged thing? Can I cast sleep on somebody?
2693820	2695820	Yeah, you can get up close to him and cast him.
2695820	2696820	I'm gonna try to put this guy to sleep.
2696820	2697820	Nice.
2697820	2698820	Nice.
2698820	2699820	Thanks, guys.
2701820	2706820	Alright, he successfully, no, he does not successfully save, making him fall asleep.
2706820	2707820	He falls asleep.
2708820	2710820	That was a real roller coaster ride.
2711820	2714820	You do not have no AIDS.
2718820	2723820	I examine his body. Is there anything left? It's clothing in his body. I examine that.
2723820	2727820	You see a rotting belt. It doesn't seem very stylish.
2730820	2733820	A quirk throws up till he dies.
2734820	2736820	Oh, I'm just kidding.
2737820	2740820	Alright, well, I got the robe on. I'm in disguise.
2740820	2742820	Go infiltrate, Sharpie.
2742820	2751820	I'm gonna infiltrate. I'm gonna watch the behavior of my cohorts, cohorts in quotes.
2752820	2756820	You notice a marked difference between two types of cohorts.
2756820	2760820	One moves stiffly, slowly, unnoticing of others.
2760820	2766820	The other seemed pretty normal, hauling corpses into the ziggurat and looking about like regular people.
2766820	2770820	We got some walking dead shit going on here. Yeah?
2770820	2772820	I say to myself.
2772820	2774820	Not knowing what walking dead shit is.
2774820	2777820	I emulate the movements of the stiff ones.
2780820	2782820	You successfully emulate the movements.
2782820	2784820	You walk among the walkers.
2784820	2800820	I'm gonna get up to that ziggurat and word you approach the door of the ziggurat. It is open.
2800820	2805820	Alright. I open the door to the ziggurat.
2805820	2807820	It's already open.
2808820	2812820	You peer inside the ziggurat and see a large stone entry hall.
2812820	2815820	Several coat racks stand in the hall.
2815820	2819820	I know that's a trick. I'm supposed to hang up the robe, but that's my disguise.
2820820	2823820	Holding several black cloaks.
2823820	2825820	I'm gonna grab a couple of them.
2825820	2826820	Yeah, bring them to us.
2826820	2827820	Yeah, grab three.
2827820	2828820	Let's say three.
2828820	2830820	There is a cultist in the room watching.
2830820	2835820	Do you try to do the sneakily or do you just like do it while looking directly at him?
2836820	2838820	He's really eyeballing me?
2838820	2843820	He hasn't taken much notice of you, but perhaps if he took a few cloaks he might.
2844820	2845820	You think to yourself.
2845820	2850820	Sharpie, bring Morris Goldbright in and tell him that he's here to pick up the dry cleaning.
2853820	2856820	I'm gonna try to cast Charm Person on him.
2856820	2857820	Okay.
2857820	2859820	You cast Charm Person.
2859820	2863820	He regards you with high interest as if you were a trusted friend or ally.
2863820	2865820	How are you doing?
2865820	2867820	How can I help you?
2867820	2870820	I need cloaks.
2870820	2873820	Well, there's tons of cloaks. You should grab several.
2876820	2878820	Just three is fine.
2878820	2879820	Are you thirsty?
2880820	2881820	Huh?
2881820	2882820	Would you like a drink?
2882820	2884820	Yeah, I guess.
2885820	2889820	He procures three cloaks and a drink and puts them in a bag for you.
2890820	2891820	Thank you.
2894820	2895820	How's Tracy?
2896820	2900820	He's like, I'm so glad you remembered. This is why we're close friends.
2901820	2903820	She's doing well, as am I.
2903820	2907820	All right, well, same shit, different day.
2911820	2915820	You know that Admiral Darkstar always creating undead and taking power naps.
2918820	2920820	Catch you on the flip flop.
2920820	2922820	Have a good time.
2924820	2929820	I stiffly exit the ziggurat and go back to my real compatriots, not in quotes.
2929820	2932820	You managed to do this with wall escaping notice.
2932820	2933820	Who's impressed now?
2933820	2934820	That was pretty good.
2934820	2935820	Yeah.
2935820	2936820	It's good, it's good.
2936820	2937820	Thank you.
2940820	2942820	Nice to see you be brave.
2942820	2944820	Well, you know, what took you so long?
2944820	2952820	Maris Gulpright's sinuses are really acting up.
2952820	2954820	It's cold out here, you know.
2954820	2956820	Maris, can you stop eating my bagels?
2956820	2958820	I'm an indoor person.
2958820	2965820	I teach these guys how to walk stiffly in a hilarious Shaun of the Dead montage.
2965820	2970820	You think you managed to communicate the proper manner in which to walk.
2970820	2972820	And that's how you do it.
2973820	2974820	Where should we go now?
2974820	2976820	Into the ziggurat.
2976820	2977820	We enter the ziggurat.
2977820	2982820	Donning the cloaks that Sharpie has brought in adopting the mannerisms of the dead,
2982820	2986820	you managed to waltz right in past all the undead and guards.
2986820	2989820	You're going to see a guy in the entryway.
2989820	2991820	It's cool, he's with me.
2993820	2995820	I examine the ziggurat.
2996820	2998820	It's the outside or the inside?
2998820	2999820	Inside.
2999820	3001820	You are in the entry hall.
3001820	3004820	Blue candles line the walls in sconces.
3004820	3009820	There are three doors, one on each wall of the squared room.
3009820	3010820	Oh, and the door you came in.
3010820	3011820	Four doors.
3011820	3012820	Sorry, guys.
3012820	3014820	Triangles are square.
3014820	3016820	Wait, what?
3016820	3017820	There's three other doors.
3017820	3018820	There's three doors.
3018820	3020820	There are three other doors against the wall.
3020820	3021820	All right.
3021820	3023820	Eenie meenie?
3023820	3026820	I approach the door on the far left.
3026820	3028820	You approach the door on the far left.
3030820	3033820	I watch your approach the door on the far left.
3033820	3036820	You witness the approaching of the door.
3036820	3041820	I examine his witness, the examination of the witness for success.
3041820	3045820	I write down a journal entry about what it was like to approach the door.
3045820	3047820	The journal entry is enthralling.
3049820	3051820	I tremble.
3052820	3054820	The tremble is pitiable.
3054820	3059820	I try to open the door.
3059820	3063820	Do you want to hear, do you want to listen at the door, perhaps?
3063820	3065820	No, no, no.
3065820	3067820	Just go, go.
3067820	3071820	You open the door holding, wearing the cloak.
3071820	3073820	No, I listen, I listen.
3073820	3078820	You listen to the sounds of people murmuring and sitting.
3078820	3079820	You hear their seats.
3079820	3081820	I hear people sitting.
3081820	3082820	You hear.
3082820	3087820	Using your half-elf ears, you hear the sitting of the people in the room.
3088820	3091820	Just so I know for reference, Spencer, what does sitting sound like?
3091820	3093820	You could just do it with your mouth.
3093820	3094820	Yeah, hold on.
3095820	3097820	All right.
3098820	3102820	I was holding the mic near my butt for the Podlaskis.
3102820	3106820	Everyone, people are talking in there quietly and sitting.
3106820	3109820	Oh, I vote for that.
3111820	3114820	I'm so tired. I'd love a seat.
3115820	3117820	You know what, Morris?
3117820	3119820	I still feel like something's going to really pay off.
3119820	3121820	I think you're going to save the day somehow.
3121820	3124820	He better, I'm telling you, we're going to get sued.
3125820	3127820	That's another stereotype, isn't it?
3129820	3131820	I'm just making it worse.
3133820	3136820	We're going to get Molotov cocktailed.
3136820	3138820	I examine the door in the middle.
3138820	3144820	You hear the sounds of dull scraping as if something is being drug across a stone floor.
3144820	3146820	I don't like that shit. Don't open.
3146820	3149820	Well, what are we hoping to hear? Happy birthday?
3149820	3151820	We're looking for the door.
3151820	3153820	I listen to the third door on the right.
3153820	3155820	You hear silence.
3155820	3157820	Well, that's a start.
3158820	3160820	I open the third door.
3160820	3161820	The silent one?
3161820	3162820	Yeah.
3162820	3163820	Okay.
3163820	3170820	The walls are draped in black wall hangings, and rows of pews made of red stained wood sit empty facing an obsidian podium.
3170820	3175820	Doubtless the cultists listen to many a mad raving or dazzling lecture in this room.
3175820	3179820	A large golden statue stands well behind the podium.
3179820	3184820	It's a human in plate mail wielding a black sword, but the statue is missing its head.
3184820	3187820	You don't know what statement the sculptor was trying to make.
3188820	3192820	Morris, you're a bit of an art critic, an art fan.
3192820	3196820	Does this speak to you at all, the statue?
3196820	3201820	Well, I'm a human. I recognize it's one of my kind.
3201820	3205820	I don't like the fact that he's missing a head.
3209820	3211820	Thank you.
3211820	3214820	I walk to the statue and examine it.
3214820	3217820	It is large, nine foot tall statue.
3217820	3221820	You can't see on top of its head because it doesn't have one.
3221820	3225820	Hey, crawl up there and see if there's a button where its head should be.
3225820	3229820	I crawl on Sharpie's shoulders to examine the top of the statue.
3229820	3233820	You can see like a setting as if something is supposed to fit in there.
3233820	3235820	Zip.
3237820	3238820	Like a dick, right?
3238820	3240820	Gentlemen.
3240820	3243820	There's a door on the other side of the room.
3244820	3246820	I examine the door.
3246820	3250820	It is made of wood. You do not approve of its design.
3251820	3254820	Fellas, nope.
3254820	3257820	Yeah, it's like that shitty belt I saw earlier.
3258820	3260820	I examined the fitting.
3260820	3262820	Tackiest ziggurat ever.
3262820	3265820	What does the fitting look like in the head?
3265820	3269820	It looks circular with a square peg.
3269820	3272820	Circular with a square peg.
3272820	3274820	Is it a button or it has a square peg in it?
3274820	3278820	It's a circular divot with a square peg protruding.
3278820	3282820	Guys, all we got to do is find a head with a peg sticking out of the neck.
3282820	3284820	Thanks, Morris.
3284820	3288820	Oh yes, we have to fix the head like a Lego piece.
3288820	3290820	Yeah, sure.
3290820	3292820	We got to go find that head.
3292820	3296820	It's got to be on the other side of this wooden door that you hate.
3296820	3299820	Guys, I hate this door, but can we go through it?
3299820	3302820	Let's listen at it. Don't forget what we learned about doors.
3302820	3305820	We listen at the door behind the statue.
3305820	3311820	Standing at the door, you can't help but shake the perceptible smell of foul rotting decay.
3311820	3316820	You hear the same scraping sounds as if something is being dragged across a stone floor.
3316820	3318820	Spencer, this is getting really scary.
3318820	3321820	That adjoins to that middle room with the scraping and the dragging.
3321820	3324820	Spencer, do I have any arrows?
3324820	3327820	You should have 12 arrows left.
3327820	3330820	Okay, I want to open the door because I have these arrows.
3330820	3332820	All right, guys, I'm going to open the door.
3332820	3334820	You ready your arrows?
3334820	3335820	Okay, I ready my arrows.
3335820	3337820	And then when I open the door, I'll just...
3337820	3339820	Morris, you've got to be ready.
3339820	3341820	I'll ready my spear.
3341820	3344820	By the way, I have a spear.
3344820	3347820	And then you get ready to charge in there in a berserker rage.
3347820	3348820	I'm ready to go.
3348820	3354820	I'm going to open the door and in one movement, I'll be kind of behind it just because someone's got to open the door.
3354820	3358820	A wave of noxious stench blasts through the door frame.
3358820	3360820	You see an assortment of bones.
3360820	3366820	It looks like a snake, but is made out of the fused rib cages of what appears to be at least 40 men.
3366820	3371820	The head of the snake is not a snake head, but instead a golden skull of a human.
3371820	3373820	We need that shit.
3373820	3378820	Its eyes are set with emeralds and around its neck hangs a golden chain with an emerald setting.
3378820	3380820	Is the snake alive? Is it moving?
3380820	3383820	It is moving about the floor, creating a loud grating sound.
3383820	3387820	I attack the snake with my sword.
3387820	3390820	Drawing your sword and lunging at the snake.
3390820	3393820	You strike at its back.
3393820	3395820	Oh no!
3395820	3397820	Everything's ruined.
3397820	3400820	You strike the back of the snake.
3400820	3404820	Your sword rings against its bone thing.
3404820	3406820	You strike a crack.
3406820	3410820	It takes 11 damage.
3410820	3411820	Is that good?
3411820	3412820	That's pretty good.
3412820	3420820	I shoot an arrow at the...
3420820	3424820	It's like a golf tournament.
3424820	3430820	Jeff Davis has swung at the human centipede monster.
3430820	3432820	11 points.
3432820	3433820	What do you think?
3433820	3437820	Like a seven sword? What was that, an eight?
3437820	3441820	What sword do you think he used on that one?
3441820	3450820	I get out from behind the door so I can get into this melee with some of my trademark spells like Ray of Frost, Magic Missile, and the like.
3450820	3453820	You head into the door as Mulrain is knocking an arrow.
3453820	3454820	She looses it.
3454820	3458820	It flies past your head directly at the snake.
3458820	3460820	Sorry.
3460820	3462820	You hit the snake critically.
3462820	3468820	It is a critical hit.
3468820	3480820	But a ratings disaster.
3480820	3487820	That was like Dane Cook's arrow.
3487820	3490820	Your arrow lodges in the neck of the snake.
3490820	3494820	It hits for 14 damage.
3494820	3497820	The snake falls apart into bone pieces.
3497820	3500820	The golden skull bounces to your feet.
3500820	3505820	I look at work for a nod of respect.
3505820	3508820	You know what, kid? You're all right.
3508820	3512820	All right. This is great.
3512820	3517820	Hey, Morris, you like gold? Go grab that head.
3517820	3522820	I inspect the head with my loop.
3522820	3525820	This is terrible.
3525820	3528820	It's easily worth at least 50 platinum pieces.
3528820	3532820	Let's take it, guys.
3532820	3535820	Into the other room and put it on top of the statue.
3535820	3540820	I take the head, jump up on Sharpie's shoulders and place the head on top of the statue.
3540820	3545820	You do that, but in the other room, you move to the other room and do that successfully.
3545820	3549820	The head fits perfectly onto the shoulders of the statue.
3549820	3556820	You hear a far-off grinding, and the statue slowly turns, revealing a staircase upwards.
3556820	3560820	Nice. Good time to quit.
3560820	3566820	You want to set up camp at the base of the staircase and just tell some stories?
3566820	3570820	Yeah, we'll just pause it, and then we'll pick things up from there next week.
3570820	3574820	We'll hit a pause. Spencer, everybody.
3575820	3578820	Yeah.
3578820	3579820	All right.
3579820	3583820	Aaron McGathey is Mulray and Sedana.
3583820	3586820	Hey, Zach, usually that clock is lit up.
3586820	3590820	What are we looking at? What have we done here tonight? What's the damage?
3590820	3599820	So, again, we've entered that portion of our show where we're forever in search of an ending.
3599820	3601820	What have we got here?
3601820	3605820	I'd said this yesterday, but there's only one guy that was here yesterday.
3605820	3609820	So I was in Asheville, North Carolina, for this very awkward wedding.
3609820	3613820	And I don't want to say awkward wedding in case the bride or groom are listening.
3613820	3619820	Aaron's little brother, Michael, is a delightful little guy, and his lovely wife, Bonnie.
3619820	3621820	Congratulations to them.
3621820	3626820	I think because of lack of resources and busy schedules and things,
3626820	3636820	they put their wedding in the hands of what I really have no problem characterizing as an evil southern family.
3636820	3644820	Just family that's like friends of the bride, but they're not related biologically to anybody,
3644820	3648820	but there were more of them at the wedding than anybody else.
3648820	3652820	It was like Dallas. They owned everything, and they hated everyone,
3652820	3656820	and they were just there to watch the wedding disappoint them.
3656820	3659820	It was a really, really weird experience.
3659820	3665820	They also hosted the wedding rehearsal dinner at their house, but they all ate inside,
3665820	3669820	and it was very cold out, and they built a fire for us, like cavemen.
3669820	3675820	And we were just welcome. They just said, you're welcome to be out there, and the cooler's full of beer.
3675820	3679820	We were just these weird visit goths camping outside their house,
3679820	3683820	and they invited us in for one game.
3683820	3686820	They had researched probably googled weddings or something,
3686820	3693820	and they invited us in into the indoors for a wedding game
3693820	3699820	where the bride and groom had to sit back to back and remove one shoe each.
3699820	3702820	So they're each holding a shoe and sitting back to back,
3702820	3706820	and then all the guests had written questions on an index card,
3706820	3709820	like, who's going to clean the toilets?
3709820	3714820	And then they each hold up one of the shoes, either theirs or the spouse's.
3714820	3719820	Dumb. Just dumb. You know, these wedding games are dumb.
3719820	3721820	These are fucked up wedding games.
3721820	3724820	If you've ever gone to a reception, I went to a wedding in Milwaukee
3724820	3729820	where they played this wedding game where the groom was blindfolded
3729820	3735820	and the bridesmaids were all lined up with the bride sitting in chairs,
3735820	3744820	and he had to try to guess which woman was his by feeling their legs.
3744820	3747820	Yeah!
3747820	3750820	That's a recipe for success.
3750820	3753820	It felt very Japanese.
3753820	3756820	Are we in Tokyo?
3756820	3759820	Are we going to start drinking pee in a minute?
3759820	3763820	Imagine a wedding. I kept thinking when I was at the wedding reception,
3763820	3767820	because there was no music, it was just kind of fluorescent lit,
3767820	3770820	and it was very fast and furious,
3770820	3775820	and there was a guy that introduced the bride and groom at the reception,
3775820	3783820	and he went like, all right, here they are, the bride and groom.
3783820	3787820	It was like we were all hostages. It was so weird.
3787820	3792820	I kept expecting, I was thinking like, this would be a great cold open of a pilot,
3792820	3797820	if you're at a wedding reception and there's something just off about it
3797820	3800820	and you don't know what it is, and then someone would run in and go,
3800820	3803820	the perimeter's breached!
3803820	3806820	There's walkers and the tripwires!
3806820	3810820	Everyone would run over to a table full of guns and suit up.
3810820	3814820	It turns out it's 2038, and we're in a free-fire zone,
3814820	3821820	and we were witnessing a brief futile attempt to emulate a Golden Age society.
3821820	3824820	Everyone's actually just space marines.
3824820	3826820	Do you want to get married?
3826820	3827820	Yeah.
3827820	3831820	What would your ideal wedding be like? Can you envision that?
3831820	3837820	You know, it'll have probably a Raiders of the Lost Ark theme, I think.
3837820	3839820	That'd be awesome.
3839820	3846820	Where the audience, the guests will be invited to help me find a new way of life together.
3846820	3850820	That the Nazis are also trying to get to.
3850820	3854820	And if they play their cards right by the end of it, it's like, thank you.
3854820	3857820	My wife and I, thank you so much for helping.
3857820	3861820	Thank God the Nazis didn't get married instead.
3861820	3865820	Which character would be the minister or the officiant?
3865820	3866820	Belac.
3866820	3868820	Belac? Really? Wow.
3868820	3871820	Yeah, because he's not so different, you and I.
3871820	3873820	That's how he would start it.
3873820	3876820	He'd go, we're not so different, you and I, Dan Harmon.
3877820	3884820	You know, we're not men of God, but we believe in value, or artifacts.
3884820	3886820	And I would go, I don't know about that.
3886820	3888820	Like, I would have an ark to my wedding.
3888820	3890820	I would want to be a protagonist.
3890820	3892820	I would learn how to get married.
3892820	3896820	I would start by going, ah, this is bullshit, you know.
3896820	3899820	All I need is my blaster on my side.
3899820	3901820	I don't believe in no force.
3901820	3903820	So you just give me all Harris and Ford boots.
3903820	3904820	Yeah, yeah.
3904820	3908820	And then the third act, I just kick someone off my plane.
3909820	3911820	I believe in the force now.
3911820	3913820	Belac.
3913820	3916820	Yeah, it would be a Harris and Ford wedding.
3916820	3918820	Would you get a bullet in the brain and forget how to love?
3918820	3921820	Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be the second act.
3921820	3922820	Ritz.
3922820	3928820	One-armed man would come and kill your wife as soon as you were married.
3928820	3930820	I didn't kill my wife.
3930820	3938820	In all seriousness, I would like to have something to the ceremony where they speak now or forever.
3938820	3940820	They do that business.
3940820	3941820	It's become a joke now.
3941820	3947820	But it would be nice to have somebody come in that was dressed as a purple monster or something and go,
3947820	3950820	I don't want this wedding to happen.
3950820	3952820	I'm lack of love.
3952820	3953820	Lack of love.
3953820	3954820	Get out of here.
3954820	3955820	I'm going to marry this woman.
3955820	3957820	Not if I have anything to do with it.
3957820	3960820	And then you wrestle in the aisle.
3960820	3961820	That would be cool.
3961820	3965820	So what you're saying is you're never going to get married.
3965820	3971820	I just need to find a woman who's willing to have her brother dressed like a purple monster.
3971820	3975820	80, do you envision yourself being married at any point?
3975820	3976820	Yeah.
3976820	3977820	Yeah?
3977820	3979820	Are you a romantic fellow?
3979820	3981820	Nope.
3981820	3983820	You don't think you have yourself as romantic?
3983820	3986820	I just want it for the tax benefits.
3986820	3992820	I mean, we don't picture ourselves dying either, but we know what's going to happen.
3992820	3994820	What just happens?
3994820	3995820	Wow.
3995820	3996820	Everybody gets married.
3996820	3997820	No, they don't.
3997820	3998820	Yeah, eventually.
3998820	4001820	Babies don't get married.
4001820	4004820	Sometimes they die.
4004820	4007820	Sometimes a baby dies without ever knowing what love is.
4007820	4009820	Oh, I'm lying?
4009820	4011820	It's truth.
4011820	4015820	Cemeteries are full of unmarried dead babies.
4015820	4017820	It's true.
4017820	4018820	I'm sorry.
4018820	4019820	Once again, I'm...
4019820	4021820	I don't approve of this.
4021820	4023820	It's fucking horrible.
4023820	4026820	They should have thought about that.
4026820	4029820	I brought this up for some reason.
4029820	4031820	I can't remember what it was.
4031820	4034820	We went on a ghost tour.
4034820	4035820	What the fuck?
4035820	4037820	Why did they bring this up?
4037820	4038820	Why did they bring this up?
4038820	4039820	We were in North Carolina.
4039820	4041820	We were there for the wedding.
4041820	4042820	Fucking A. I'm so sorry.
4042820	4043820	You went on a ghost tour.
4043820	4044820	You didn't tell me about it.
4044820	4045820	Well, we went on a ghost tour.
4045820	4048820	Yeah, we went on a walking ghost tour of Asheville.
4048820	4049820	Was it a ghost adventure?
4049820	4051820	It was a ghost adventure, yeah.
4051820	4054820	It was like a ghost hunter thing.
4054820	4056820	Was it two guys with treble tattoos next to you?
4056820	4059820	No, it was just this hippie lady with more socks and sandals
4059820	4060820	and a windbreaker.
4060820	4061820	What was it outside?
4061820	4062820	Yeah, she just...
4062820	4063820	Well, because they don't have any money,
4063820	4064820	so you're just walking around.
4064820	4066820	She's just pointing at buildings.
4066820	4068820	And everybody goes, get out of here.
4068820	4071820	She's like, I don't know what his problem is.
4071820	4073820	You know, you keep pointing at his church
4073820	4076820	and telling people that someone got murdered there.
4076820	4077820	Like, beat it.
4077820	4079820	Get a job, you hippie.
4079820	4083820	She should say that those guys are ghosts.
4083820	4086820	This house is haunted by a guy that hates you on his property.
4086820	4089820	She did try to characterize that and other things as paranormal.
4089820	4091820	Like, we walked past a place, and she's like,
4091820	4096820	every business that opens here goes away within two weeks.
4096820	4097820	I'm like, yeah, there's no parking.
4097820	4101820	It's a terrible location.
4101820	4102820	We're in a recession.
4102820	4103820	Isn't that a ghost story?
4103820	4106820	Ghost hunters traipsing through your property.
4106820	4110820	It's like the ghost of our economy is haunting.
4110820	4113820	I'm like, oh, Ronald, is this still trickling down
4113820	4116820	from the Reagan days?
4116820	4123820	She gave Aaron an actual meter and said,
4123820	4131820	these detect ghosts, also electricity and water.
4132820	4134820	And temperature variations.
4134820	4137820	So, you know, use your own discretion.
4137820	4140820	It really is just like a random.
4140820	4142820	It is next to a building.
4142820	4150820	I got a ghost building, power line, fire hydrant, or sidewalk here.
4150820	4152820	So that was her tool.
4152820	4155820	But she looked the most like a ghost buster holding that thing
4155820	4157820	because at least it was beeping and lighting up.
4157820	4160820	I got a thermometer.
4160820	4162820	It was one of those laser thermometers.
4162820	4164820	And she gave it to me.
4164820	4166820	She was like, temperature variations can't, you know,
4166820	4169820	when there's ghosts, it can be very cold and all this stuff.
4169820	4171820	So a thermometer can actually be a valuable thing.
4171820	4173820	And I'm down with that.
4173820	4176820	And I never had one of these laser thermometers.
4176820	4178820	And I pointed it across the street and was like,
4178820	4180820	hey, how do these things work anyway?
4180820	4182820	I don't mean how do they detect ghosts.
4182820	4186820	I mean, how do they read temperature from across the street?
4186820	4187820	That's really wild.
4187820	4188820	She's like, you know what?
4188820	4190820	I don't know.
4190820	4192820	I thought that was hilariously funny.
4192820	4195820	You're giving me a thermometer and saying you can use it to detect ghosts.
4195820	4197820	Hey, how does it work as a thermometer?
4197820	4199820	I don't know.
4199820	4200820	I don't know.
4200820	4204820	There's a ghost in the machine.
4204820	4207820	Adam Goldberg claps for that.
4207820	4212820	So you are fucked, my friend.
4212820	4216820	Then the other girl, what did the girl that was the only person
4216820	4218820	that was actually into the whole thing?
4218820	4219820	What did she get?
4219820	4220820	What was her tool?
4220820	4222820	Oh, she had another ghost meter.
4222820	4224820	The girls got ghost meters.
4224820	4229820	It was two couples, two couples.
4229820	4234820	I got a thermometer and then the remaining guy, this poor fucker,
4234820	4237820	he got dowsing rods.
4237820	4243820	He got two sticks that move together if there's a ghost or water
4243820	4246820	for electricity around.
4246820	4249820	He got too heavy for him to hold anymore.
4249820	4250820	He was like using them.
4250820	4254820	I'm going to guess that because you didn't open the show with this story,
4254820	4257820	I'm going to guess you didn't see any ghosts.
4257820	4258820	We did not.
4258820	4263820	She encouraged us to take a lot of pictures and then you take pictures
4263820	4267820	of high ghost areas and then you look at them and then you see a blob
4267820	4269820	on the thing and you go, oh, it was a ghost.
4269820	4270820	Orbs.
4270820	4271820	Yeah, orbs.
4271820	4272820	Orbs, yeah.
4272820	4274820	I used to be a ghost owner.
4274820	4276820	No big deal.
4276820	4278820	Yeah, and then she would just go.
4278820	4281820	Obviously, the tour was designed at an age before Google because she would
4281820	4284820	walk past the building and go, yeah, 13 people jumped off of that building
4284820	4285820	during the Depression.
4285820	4288820	You'd just pull up your phone and go, no.
4288820	4290820	No one ever jumped off that building.
4290820	4292820	You're a ridiculous person.
4292820	4295820	Now, are you guys familiar with the show Ghost Adventures and Zach Bagan's
4295820	4296820	It's Hosts?
4296820	4297820	Anyone?
4297820	4298820	Right applause?
4298820	4301820	I tweeted Zach Bagan's before I went on this ghost adventure for advice
4301820	4303820	and he said, don't fart.
4307820	4311820	It's like spraying off in the jungle.
4311820	4314820	I guess ghosts hate farts is what he was saying.
4314820	4317820	Is that why he doesn't see any ghosts on the show?
4317820	4323820	It's constantly going to Arby's before a ghost adventure.
4323820	4325820	That show is so fucking ridiculous.
4325820	4326820	I love it.
4326820	4328820	Yeah, we got to get back on the ghost adventures.
4328820	4330820	Can we get back into it on the show?
4330820	4332820	No, he'd never do that.
4332820	4334820	He's a ghost hunter.
4334820	4336820	Of course we can get him on the show.
4336820	4339820	Tell him there's a ghost at Nerd Milk.
4339820	4344820	Tell him comedy dies here every night.
4344820	4357820	They say you can still hear Dana Gould's set howling on the old number nine.
4357820	4364820	I honestly don't remember why I brought up North Carolina.
4364820	4366820	It was an awkward wedding reception.
4366820	4369820	The Jackson family, if you're listening, you can go fuck yourselves.
4369820	4371820	Just bad people.
4371820	4374820	Don't ever.
4374820	4378820	The next person that has a wedding rehearsal dinner,
4378820	4383820	they're going to be so confused by how many questions I have before I show up.
4383820	4385820	Are you sure it's okay if I come?
4385820	4387820	Like, am I welcome?
4387820	4391820	Because I've never felt so unwelcome in a wedding rehearsal in my life.
4391820	4394820	Oh, the stupid wedding game where they're holding up the shoes.
4394820	4397820	Everyone has to write down a thing on an index card and ask a question.
4397820	4399820	I wrote three drafts of my question.
4399820	4401820	I thought very hard about it.
4401820	4403820	Every of the questions are supposed to be like,
4403820	4405820	who's going to be the first to fart in bed?
4405820	4407820	Who's going to clean the toilets?
4407820	4410820	Who's going to file the taxes?
4410820	4418820	And I wrote, it is the year 2038.
4418820	4420820	Nuclear Armageddon has occurred.
4420820	4424820	There are bands of mutant raiders are encroaching on your territory
4424820	4426820	to take your last can of beans.
4426820	4431820	Which of the two of you is most likely to be the first to use lethal force
4431820	4434820	to protect your resources?
4434820	4438820	And they didn't, they just like, I think they saw the question
4438820	4442820	and they didn't, they didn't, they just, what's this, a novel?
4442820	4443820	They didn't ask it.
4443820	4444820	I didn't want them to.
4444820	4447820	Fuck them, they would have butchered it.
4447820	4449820	I, you know, Erin went out and grabbed the question
4449820	4453820	and shared it with her brother and he's like, now there's a question.
4453820	4456820	I've been answering about farts all night, holding up a shoe.
4456820	4458820	I feel like an idiot.
4458820	4459820	There's a good question.
4459820	4460820	Thank you, Michael.
4460820	4462820	McGathey, I agree.
4462820	4466820	I should be a writer.
4466820	4469820	Everybody dresses Jareth for Halloween from Labyrinth.
4469820	4472820	Right, do you know about this?
4472820	4475820	Dan and Erin and I, we're all dressing as Jareth from Labyrinth,
4475820	4477820	David Bowie's character.
4477820	4478820	We encourage everybody to come.
4478820	4480820	What's our show near Halloween, 29th?
4480820	4483820	We have, we have two shows in the practice room near Halloween.
4483820	4486820	We have a show on the 22nd of October, that's next week.
4486820	4488820	And then we have a show on the 29th.
4488820	4489820	29th.
4489820	4490820	So we say the 29th.
4490820	4492820	The 29th is going to be our Halloween harm in town.
4492820	4495820	We encourage you to come as Jareth, David Bowie's character from Labyrinth.
4495820	4499820	And then all the Jareths, we're all going to go take over some bar.
4499820	4500820	We're all going to go somewhere.
4500820	4501820	We'll figure it out.
4501820	4503820	I want 900 Jareths to walk into it.
4503820	4506820	And we're going to sing Dance Muppet Dance.
4506820	4507820	What's the...
4507820	4512820	Dance Magic Dance, Magic Dance.
4512820	4516820	It's a Halloween Jareth.
4516820	4523820	I want to dress like Jareth for Halloween.
4523820	4526820	It's a pretty good Bowie.
4526820	4527820	That's not bad.
4527820	4530820	It's not bad at all.
4530820	4531820	Can you do an early Bowie?
4531820	4535820	It's better than Sean Connery.
4535820	4540820	Most things down here don't react well to bullets.
4540820	4544820	Sean Connery, Bowie.
4544820	4549820	And Netflix, the great, just because of your impression of Liam Neeson.
4549820	4551820	They don't care about Netflix.
4551820	4553820	They're not herbivores.
4553820	4556820	They don't stream direct-to-video.
4556820	4561820	They don't see proceeds from video on demand.
4561820	4567820	It's only available for a limited window that the writers killed agreed to.
4567820	4569820	They don't get residuals.
4569820	4573820	They just want to eat you.
4573820	4581820	All right, well, let's figure out how to end this thing.
4581820	4583820	Quick improv scene.
4583820	4585820	I'm coming to your store.
4585820	4588820	Steve Agee has a... what kind of store?
4588820	4591820	I heard Pickles.
4591820	4592820	Pickles store.
4592820	4595820	Pickles store?
4595820	4599820	Dan, just so you know, I have my finger on the play button for Xanadu.
4599820	4600820	Okay.
4600820	4601820	So it's ready to go.
4601820	4604820	Honestly, I can tell the difference between a pity laugh where you're just like,
4604820	4608820	I want to go home, so I'm going to pretend like that was funny enough to close the show.
4608820	4609820	I won't do it.
4609820	4611820	The more you do that, the more I'll punish you.
4611820	4614820	You'll be here all night.
4614820	4620820	We will close the show on a genuine, sincere, joyous eruption and nothing more.
4620820	4625820	Nothing lasts, sorry.
4625820	4643820	All right, so Steve Agee has a pickle store, and I am an Amish farmer.
4643820	4646820	He farms Amish people.
4647820	4650820	Ding, ding, ding, ding.
4650820	4652820	Is this...
4652820	4654820	Pickles.
4654820	4657820	Welcome to Pickles.
4657820	4665820	I noticed you spelled it P-I-K-K-Y-L-Z exclamation point, exclamation point.
4665820	4669820	Yeah, my father started the business and he was a half-wit.
4669820	4672820	Oh, so it's not just, it's not charming.
4672820	4673820	He's just dumb.
4673820	4675820	It's just stupid.
4675820	4687820	Well, I guess I'll take two standard dills, a sweet basket, and can I get a jar of relish?
4687820	4692820	Just then, the owner of Pickles, the old man who created the store, Adam Goldberg,
4692820	4695820	enters the Pickles store.
4695820	4699820	Why, we got a customer!
4699820	4701820	Oh, fuck.
4701820	4702820	Hey, Dad.
4702820	4706820	Hey, relish man, here for your relish.
4706820	4709820	Dad, he wants a relish basket.
4709820	4710820	Oh, just one?
4710820	4711820	Upsell him, upsell him.
4711820	4713820	We only get like five customers a week.
4713820	4715820	I can hear you.
4715820	4717820	Can he hear me?
4717820	4720820	Yeah, you can see you too, Dad.
4720820	4721820	There are a lot of...
4721820	4724820	Did he make fun of the sign?
4724820	4726820	He wasn't impressed with the sign, Dad.
4726820	4727820	Did you tell him why the...
4727820	4728820	Did you call me a...
4728820	4730820	Half-wit, yeah.
4730820	4733820	I am a three-quarter wit.
4733820	4735820	He's a three-quarter wit, I'm sorry.
4735820	4739820	I am in the room, and I won't be upsold.
4739820	4742820	I heard you say, upsell him.
4742820	4745820	I came here for Pickles.
4745820	4747820	Well, we got him.
4747820	4749820	The two dills you said was...
4749820	4752820	Yeah, I'm already ordering a shitload of Pickles.
4752820	4754820	That is a shitload.
4754820	4756820	Have you joined the membership club?
4756820	4758820	We send out a little...
4758820	4761820	I don't want to get any junk mail from you.
4761820	4764820	It's mostly recipes, and it's mostly the same recipes,
4764820	4766820	like how to turn a cucumber into pickles.
4766820	4770820	Things take a decidedly romantic turn somehow.
4770820	4773820	Membership has its benefits.
4780820	4785820	Adam Goldberg closes his second episode of Harbontown.
4786820	4789820	Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Goldberg.
