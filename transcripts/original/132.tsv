0	25000	Ladies and gentlemen, Harman Thompson, the Mayor of Harman Thompson, Ken Harman!
26000	27000	Thank you!
27000	30000	Boy, what a show we have for you tonight.
30000	32000	We do have a pretty great show.
32000	33000	What an important show.
33000	36000	I mean, we've got to do the most important thing at the top of it.
36000	39000	I don't know if it's, but it's got to be dealt with immediately.
39000	47000	We had a show, the last time we had a show, the feedback was, it was voluminous.
47000	48000	Really?
48000	51000	I wasn't here for that show, so I don't, I'm not caught up.
51000	54000	Talk to me as if I'm a baby.
54000	55000	I don't know.
55000	61000	There was a problem unique to just societal groupings.
61000	64000	Like, it's a problem that, you know, how do you, how do you solve it?
64000	65000	We've been through this before.
65000	67000	Harman Town is supposed to be a tribe of misfits.
67000	70000	We're going to colonize the moon, and so what do you do about your Adam Goldbergs?
70000	75000	You know, are they, are they mascots because they're the misfits of misfits?
75000	80000	Or are they somehow an opportunity for us to prove that we too can rule the earth by, you know,
81000	86000	we just crucify them and go like, yeah, no, we even, we have lines.
86000	90000	Oh, do I get to vote?
90000	92000	I'm voting against that.
92000	95000	I think, you know, I believe in open systems.
95000	100000	I don't think that key and tumbler societies are going to ever evolve.
100000	104000	I think you have to have one code, and you have to be able to follow it no matter what.
104000	107000	And our code is, no one gets bullied, everyone fits in.
107000	113000	So then last, last show, like, like just from Twitter to Reddit and everywhere in between,
113000	117000	a lot of feedback about this guy's laugh.
124000	128000	Now we're going to, we're going to bring him up and put a face on this problem because I think.
128000	130000	No, not in a shaming way.
130000	131000	Not in a shaming way at all.
131000	132000	The opposite.
132000	137000	I don't want to humanize this guy because I, I most of all just feel bad for him.
137000	147000	I also then, then second to that, I feel bad for 30,000 people that that were like unprecedentedly
147000	149000	distracted by this guy's life.
149000	153000	Well, it's a tough one because you want people to laugh, but then they laugh too much.
153000	155000	And you're like, all right, calm down.
155000	159000	Their laugh just hits that chimpanzee distress call frequencies.
159000	165000	That makes people go like, I'm glad he's having a good time, but now I feel like a spotted leopard's hunting me.
165000	166000	I don't know.
166000	169000	His laugh is like a crying baby on an airplane for some people.
169000	172000	It's the difficult thing with the society.
172000	174000	Of course, this is the most difficult of all.
174000	178000	What are we going to outlaw this guy's mirth?
178000	182000	Tell him, have less fun.
182000	185000	Yeah, that moment when you're least self-conscious and full of joy.
185000	186000	Yeah.
186000	187000	Take it down a notch.
188000	195000	Then everything we say about the government up here, every time a cop stabs a guy.
195000	196000	I know.
196000	197000	You can't stab people?
197000	200000	No, they just shoot them.
200000	201000	I don't read the news.
201000	204000	Well, they stab them with those little, those flying knives that come out of the knife dispensers.
204000	205000	Okay.
205000	209000	Wait, you're thinking of scorpion from Mortal Kombat.
209000	210000	Get over here.
210000	211000	Yeah.
211000	214000	Actually, stay there.
214000	218000	What was that?
218000	219000	We're just scorpion.
219000	221000	You distracted me with Mortal Kombat.
221000	222000	No, but it's interesting.
222000	224000	You're saying that this is where the line is.
224000	229000	If we introduce this law, then everything falls apart.
229000	230000	Yeah.
230000	233000	All the things that we make fun of governments and corporations for doing when they're like,
233000	235000	oh, hey, everybody, make up a new flavor of Mountain Dew.
235000	236000	Exactly.
236000	241000	Just have fun and fencing your humanity, and you're not allowed to do this.
241000	242000	Yeah.
242000	244000	Then it all breaks down.
244000	250000	We are judged tonight as a tribe by how we treat laughing men.
250000	252000	The eyes of God are on us.
252000	253000	And I don't know.
253000	255000	I'm excited about it because I don't know what the answer is.
255000	256000	No.
256000	259000	Except the first step is always communication.
259000	269000	Always like, you know, I assume he's willing to come up because he sounds like he's having a wonderful time.
269000	270000	It's Doug, right?
270000	271000	Okay.
271000	272000	Doug is here.
272000	274000	We put him in the front row away from the microphones tonight.
274000	280000	Doug, have a seat.
280000	281000	Hello.
281000	283000	I will say this.
283000	284000	Hello, everyone.
284000	288000	Right off the bat, I'll tell you what pisses me off, Doug.
288000	292000	You come to Meltdown every week, and that's never been a fucking problem at Meltdown.
292000	296000	Are we not funny enough for you?
296000	299000	It's just never been commented on at Meltdown.
299000	301000	Oh, oh, okay.
301000	304000	But we don't record Meltdown, so there isn't like Twitter, you know.
304000	310000	It was like, I remember a night when I could hear it, and I was like, my thing is like, it's not that I don't like it.
310000	314000	My thing is it makes me feel like a liar.
314000	319000	It sounds like my uncle's at the show, and it's like the Cream City comedy competition, and he's like,
319000	321000	ahhhh!
321000	323000	DRAVE THROUGHS HER!
323000	325000	HIDE!
325000	327000	For the consumer.
327000	329000	Who's voting, who's voting?
329000	337000	It makes me wonder how funny I really am, because it sounds like Above and Beyond.
337000	344000	But last week, I wasn't really that conscious of it, but then it must have been a microphone thing, the sound mix thing or something.
345000	348000	I've never gotten so many tweets about one topic.
348000	351000	And we talk about racers.
351000	354000	Yeah, you've said a lot of controversial crazy shit.
354000	357000	I call the Irish dirty little potato people.
357000	361000	I got seven tweets from Irish people going, you're right, we don't care.
361000	366000	But this fucking, this guy is human Belfast.
366000	368000	Human Belfast?
368000	371000	The time of troubles are upon us again.
371000	374000	Yeah, he's the potato famine of Marmon Town.
374000	381000	We need a peace wall built around him so that the Protestant laugh listeners can get along with the Catholic ones.
381000	386000	So anyway, Doug, I think you've been quiet through all this.
386000	392000	What, was it different last week, or last show?
392000	396000	I was a little high last week.
397000	399000	But I...
399000	400000	Oh no.
400000	405000	I'll pull the microphone away when I laugh.
408000	409000	But yeah, I know.
409000	411000	Should we, should we, I'm sorry.
411000	412000	It's all right.
412000	420000	Shouldn't we get like a, shouldn't we somebody tell him like a really funny joke so that we can measure the...
420000	423000	He's literally hiding the microphone with his palm right now.
423000	425000	Because some people might not know what we're talking about.
425000	440000	If we were a sophisticated like fancy broadcast show, we'd play a clip from last episode where you just hear me going like, like, like, like, Jeff at one point, I said, yeah, there's, I was talking about 9-11 conspiracies and Back to the Future, regarding the Twin Pines parking lot.
440000	444000	And Jeff said, Pine 11?
444000	447000	Yeah, put it to your mouth.
447000	448000	See?
448000	451000	I love a good pun.
451000	455000	What got you was Pine 11.
455000	457000	Pine 11.
457000	461000	That's the 9-11 of jokes.
461000	463000	I'm also a huge Back to the Future fan.
463000	471000	So, and I, and I always knew consciously watching that, that, yeah, there's only, it's Lone Pine Mall because he hit the pine back then.
471000	472000	Right.
472000	476000	And some guys going like, whoa, what about, why is there only one shower now?
476000	477000	It's blowing my mind.
477000	483000	Which is truly not even, not to get too grim, but that's not even a significant event in the 9-11 timeline, the time there was one tower.
483000	489000	Like, I know it happened for a couple of minutes on CNN, but like, we don't want to dwell on that.
489000	494000	That's not like, oh, the one tower time, like, they fucking came down.
494000	497000	Oh my God, we had so much more hope back then, remember?
497000	499000	Oh, just half as much.
499000	500000	Yeah.
500000	502000	People were outside chanting, you, uh.
502000	504000	Yeah.
504000	505000	You, uh.
505000	506000	And then, and then it fell.
506000	508000	And then it was like, it was like electric company.
508000	517000	And then the other half that loved the people in the other tower go, say, you, uh, say, you, uh, say, you, say.
517000	519000	Like, remember the electric company?
519000	521000	Snake.
521000	522000	Snake.
522000	527000	See, that's funnier than the Pine, Pine 11.
528000	529000	Well, okay.
529000	535000	So, so, I mean, you know, I think that, uh, I'm already, I'm already, I'm already encouraged by the conversation.
535000	537000	You were high.
537000	541000	That's a, maybe, I think we can't ask you to stop having fun.
541000	549000	And I'm certain, I certainly, I certainly believe marijuana should be, should be legal, but maybe for you,
549000	554000	it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be allowed before the show.
554000	556000	This is how governments start.
556000	557000	Okay.
557000	560000	Maybe, maybe, Frida, you kind of passive-aggressive law.
560000	562000	Law is law.
562000	566000	It starts with, with, with don't eviscerate a prostitute on a foggy cobblestone street.
566000	567000	Yeah.
567000	569000	Just to get rid of Jack the Ripper.
569000	570000	Yeah.
570000	571000	Next thing you know.
571000	573000	Craft is running the world.
576000	578000	The Thames is chocolate.
578000	581000	Wait, that sounds great.
582000	586000	Next time I, I get an inkling, I won't, uh, before coming to Harmanton.
586000	587000	How about that?
587000	591000	Uh, what would you get an inkling to, to, when you want to get high you mean?
591000	592000	Yeah.
592000	594000	To ease the back pain.
594000	595000	Oh, really?
595000	597000	Is that what it is?
597000	600000	It's, because of back pain?
600000	601000	Yeah.
601000	602000	Oh, okay.
602000	603000	Okay.
603000	604000	It's also, I mean, it's also great.
604000	605000	Like, it also feels amazing.
605000	606000	Yeah.
606000	608000	So, Doug, were you aware of this controversy before tonight?
608000	609000	Before.
614000	619000	Like, like, like, like Batman is on the toilet right now.
619000	622000	She keeps getting halfway up.
622000	626000	God damn, is there a, I, I know that laugh.
632000	634000	But I'm, but I'm on the toilet and I'm Batman.
634000	636000	It's not Bruce Wayne on the toilet, it's Batman.
636000	637000	Yeah.
637000	638000	He's in a cowl.
638000	639000	He's got his outfit.
639000	642000	That's the weird thing about the, that's the thing they never explore in the movies
642000	648000	is that, is that, uh, Bruce Wayne has a really, he extends his dichotomous, like, weird schism
648000	650000	in his personality to the shits he takes.
650000	652000	Like, he's like, I'm going to take a Batman shit.
652000	653000	Yeah.
653000	658000	The one that flushes my bowels of the scum and crime that have.
658000	660000	I wish I had that option.
660000	664000	Like, every now and then I feel like I want to take a Batman shit, but I can't do it.
664000	665000	Yeah.
665000	666000	So, it's like.
666000	667000	It's like a little Alfred.
667000	668000	Yeah.
668000	670000	It's a little Alfred.
670000	671000	Yeah.
671000	675000	I do like five Alfreds in a row rather than one Batman.
675000	682000	Technically speaking, sir, there is a certain amount of pebbles in your lower colon.
682000	685000	They could be dispensed of optimum comfort.
685000	689000	However, it could be put off to a later time.
689000	692000	And then a Batman shit's like, get it out.
692000	693000	Yeah.
694000	697000	Uh, my parents did.
699000	701000	I'm going to take the shit out of this shit.
701000	702000	All right.
702000	703000	Well, okay.
703000	707000	So, Doug, so what, well, I guess we got a human face.
707000	709000	Well, let's monitor things.
709000	711000	Let's see how it goes.
711000	714000	We love you and we're in your corner.
714000	717000	I applaud everyone speaking out.
717000	722000	I don't know if you needed to be so mean about some of your plays you're putting up today.
722000	726000	No, I mean, what was some of the stuff they said, Dan?
726000	728000	You don't have to, you know, it's the internet.
728000	732000	We're starting to realize not everything that you don't like makes you want to kill yourself.
732000	734000	You don't have to use that language every time.
734000	740000	There's real stuff in the world that should make you want to kill yourself, starting with poverty.
740000	742000	You can just dislike someone's laugh.
742000	744000	It doesn't make you want to kill yourself.
744000	748000	Internet's really a place of subtle opinions.
748000	754000	It's either you love something and want to marry it or you want to kill it with fire.
754000	756000	That's the internet.
756000	760000	Extreme opinions are the only things that make it to the internet.
760000	761000	Well, all right.
761000	765000	Well, let's thank Doug and send him back down.
765000	767000	Thank you, guys.
773000	776000	It's the human face that really, that solves half the problem.
776000	779000	You just look at him and go, he looks like a fine young gentleman.
779000	784000	It's also tough because everything we say he laughs at, and it's hard to dislike that.
784000	786000	Yeah, yeah.
786000	788000	Yeah, I think we figured it out.
788000	792000	We move him away from the microphones and live your life, Doug.
795000	796000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
796000	802000	I was actually going to say that, well, in exchange for that, we told him, there's no way.
802000	803000	Why am I sharing this?
803000	805000	Now I have to share it just because it's funny.
805000	811000	I think Dustin told him, look, we'll always have that seat away from the microphones available,
811000	813000	but it's a good seat, so now tonight everyone's going to be like,
813000	815000	Here, go, bigger!
817000	819000	It's going to, yeah.
819000	820000	But don't do that.
820000	822000	Be cool.
822000	823000	There's shame involved, too.
823000	826000	Don't forget that.
826000	830000	I do most of the show like this.
830000	836000	All right, so we got, you know, normally I would babble about things I've seen.
836000	840000	I share my Aaron quote of the week.
840000	841000	Yes.
841000	846000	Do you have a music cue for this segment called My Wife Aaron's Funniest Line of the Week?
851000	853000	Yeah.
853000	858000	That's a perfect number of beats.
858000	861000	About six.
861000	862000	I want to make sure I get it right.
862000	863000	I wrote it down.
863000	865000	We were watching the movie.
865000	873000	The movie is called A Most Violent Year, and about halfway through it, when Joseph Campbell
873000	879000	says a hero should meet with his goddess, Aaron met with one of her own that I didn't realize
879000	884000	she was meeting with when she exasperatingly said, from the bed next to me,
885000	889000	oh, God, just give them their Oscars so they can stop.
893000	898000	It's a movie about a guy who does not want to get involved with the movie that he's in.
898000	902000	And he succeeds for the whole movie.
902000	904000	Did you, you didn't like the movie?
904000	909000	I actually did enjoy it quite a bit, but it's kind of remarkable how, like, the movie,
909000	911000	there's a lot of good movies right now.
911000	916000	Have I passed my curmudgeon phase and now I'm just a wild-eyed babe in the woods?
916000	921000	Am I now in that weird, creepy uncle, like, I love Pokemon?
921000	924000	I feel like my birdman was really enjoyable.
924000	926000	Yeah, you're going to pick up a book.
926000	932000	I thought for a while that I'd enjoy the kind of movie that might get awards
932000	937000	or have some degree of cultural efficacy that you were down to Transformers
937000	940000	or you had to just watch something in French.
940000	944000	And, you know, I don't know, I've seen some movies that just saw that Alan Turing movie,
944000	948000	the adaptation thing. Have you seen that?
948000	953000	I don't understand why, why aren't gay people more angry?
953000	959000	I didn't know they invented computers and that we killed them for it.
959000	962000	I use computers.
962000	967000	If I don't understand, they're gay people. They never did anything.
967000	971000	They literally are a problem that solves itself.
971000	973000	Jesus Christ.
973000	977000	I'm serious, to the extent that you're scared of them doing anything,
977000	981000	you don't have to be. There's always another gay person.
981000	984000	They're not trying to do anything.
984000	988000	I like the idea of someone who's homophobic but also logical about it.
988000	991000	They're a problem, but they'll solve themselves.
991000	996000	That's just not even if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who's terrified.
996000	998000	And then we get back to that conversation.
998000	1000000	Obviously we know what they're terrified of.
1000000	1002000	They're terrified that they themselves are gay.
1002000	1005000	I gotta make a law against how gay I am.
1005000	1009000	But it's not just that. I think it is people who are fully straight,
1009000	1013000	not afraid of being gay, who hate gay people.
1013000	1018000	Are we sure about that? Because there are so many things to hate.
1018000	1024000	Are we sure that all straight homophobia is not ultimately rooted
1024000	1028000	in a fear of, like,
1028000	1033000	man, if this was legal, I would suck every dick in this room.
1033000	1036000	And I wouldn't know who I am.
1036000	1040000	I gotta get to work in the morning. This has to stay forbidden.
1040000	1046000	If it's legalized, I'm gonna suck someone's dick.
1046000	1047000	So I have to fight it.
1047000	1049000	Well, also, the gay marriage thing, you can feel it.
1049000	1050000	Because why would you hate that?
1050000	1054000	If you already hated gay people, then you hated them for what?
1054000	1059000	Wearing the police hats and dancing and being promiscuous,
1059000	1062000	archetypes of, like, oh, nothing sacred, honey child.
1062000	1064000	I'm gay. I wanna dance.
1064000	1068000	Why, for that mindset, wouldn't them wanting to get married
1068000	1070000	and have George Takei stroll down the street
1070000	1073000	with his husband holding hands with Froyo?
1073000	1076000	Why wouldn't that make you go, oh, okay, fine?
1076000	1078000	The only reason is because you're thinking,
1078000	1083000	well, why did I marry a woman then?
1083000	1087000	I didn't know I could have it all.
1087000	1088000	But it's...
1088000	1094000	The thing that got me elected and the thing I love to do in bathrooms?
1094000	1097000	It doesn't count as long as it's in a public bathroom.
1097000	1103000	God can't see through stall doors.
1103000	1105000	I think then, because then they're like,
1105000	1109000	oh, then it's harder to tell which ones they are, you know?
1109000	1111000	What are they gonna do? Save us from overpopulation?
1111000	1113000	What's the worst thing they're gonna do?
1113000	1114000	Well, but it's true.
1114000	1116000	I mean, if you look at religion and stuff,
1116000	1117000	a lot of religions are against that.
1117000	1120000	So it's not just people who are gay and scared of it.
1120000	1123000	It's also people who are scared of something that is different from them
1123000	1125000	or that they see as being different from them.
1125000	1127000	Those religions come from a time when if you weren't having a baby
1127000	1130000	every nine months, you were treasonous.
1130000	1133000	Because our species was at war with the weather.
1133000	1136000	Yeah.
1136000	1140000	Like penguins were eyeing us up for the throne.
1140000	1141000	Right.
1141000	1144000	Like, well, we're both being eaten by predators
1144000	1146000	who's to say you're not the penguins.
1146000	1148000	And we're like, keep fucking!
1148000	1150000	Hurry up, get more kids in the field.
1150000	1152000	They're gonna pick corn.
1152000	1155000	And then you walk in on your friend Steve and your friend Neil,
1155000	1158000	and you're like, guys, come on, knock it off.
1158000	1160000	We're trying something.
1160000	1162000	We're going for something.
1162000	1165000	So maybe there was like, I don't want to use the word justification.
1165000	1167000	That's the terrible word.
1167000	1172000	But those people thought stars could talk.
1172000	1176000	They believed that logs were good luck on Thursday
1176000	1178000	if you painted them black.
1178000	1180000	And they had reasons to believe that stuff
1180000	1182000	because they didn't have telescopes.
1182000	1185000	But once you get a telescope, you look through it at your gay friend
1185000	1190000	and you go, it just looks like a very up-close gay person to me.
1190000	1193000	There's Saturn, there's Steve, and let's...
1193000	1194000	No, it's true.
1194000	1196000	I mean, religion is from a time before we had...
1196000	1198000	Like, we get a new iPhone every year
1198000	1202000	and we can't get someone to pick another pass at the Quran.
1202000	1204000	Like, you can't...
1204000	1206000	There should be some firmware.
1206000	1207000	There should be.
1207000	1210000	There should be some religion firmware.
1210000	1213000	Just an update that you have to get.
1213000	1215000	Then it's like, it was a different time.
1215000	1217000	Women can own the same amount of property.
1217000	1219000	It's fine.
1219000	1221000	We were wrong then.
1221000	1224000	I think we've whipped a cauldron into a froth
1224000	1227000	that our guest is going to be the most at home in.
1227000	1229000	Let's bring up David Kress!
1236000	1237000	Hello.
1243000	1244000	This is good.
1244000	1245000	All right.
1250000	1252000	There was some extended applause there.
1252000	1255000	I think your legacy is palpable in this room.
1255000	1258000	Can you, in post, can you give it another minute?
1261000	1263000	One of you was clapping too hard.
1263000	1264000	I know.
1264000	1267000	There's one guy in the front that makes looping impossible.
1267000	1269000	There's always this seam.
1271000	1275000	But yeah, we just started touching on the unsolvable
1276000	1279000	but always fun subject of like...
1279000	1281000	Of a most violent year sucking.
1281000	1282000	I know.
1282000	1283000	I saw it.
1283000	1286000	I did not care for it for so many reasons.
1286000	1289000	I thought he sounded a little too much like Andy Garcia.
1289000	1290000	I don't care about that.
1290000	1291000	I just thought...
1291000	1293000	I mean, it was...
1296000	1297000	It was...
1297000	1299000	Everything about it was halfway.
1299000	1302000	The story was halfway.
1302000	1304000	The resolution was halfway.
1304000	1306000	The acting was halfway.
1306000	1307000	Well, that was...
1307000	1308000	It was like...
1309000	1310000	Well, halfway to good.
1310000	1311000	But it was...
1312000	1313000	It was like...
1313000	1315000	It's like what your wife was saying.
1315000	1318000	It's like they all think they're going to get an Oscar.
1318000	1319000	You can tell.
1319000	1320000	They're all...
1320000	1321000	That's in the back of their heads.
1321000	1323000	I like that you're saying everything is halfway
1323000	1326000	but the name is the most extreme name possible.
1327000	1329000	A most violent year.
1329000	1330000	I know.
1330000	1332000	We kept thinking because in the beginning there's like a gas truck
1332000	1335000	gets hijacked and then Aaron and I were saying,
1335000	1337000	oh, is this like the cold open and as the truck drives away
1337000	1341000	you pan over to a calendar and it says January 1st.
1344000	1346000	Is the whole movie just like...
1348000	1349000	I really...
1351000	1353000	Yeah, I didn't care for that movie.
1353000	1355000	Have you seen some stuff you do care for?
1355000	1356000	What do you think of Birdman?
1357000	1362000	I enjoyed watching it and I liked the first two of the six endings.
1363000	1365000	I preferred the first two.
1366000	1370000	Then endings three, four, five and six, they lost me.
1370000	1372000	I will say like I got...
1372000	1375000	There's some movies I get to a point around...
1375000	1377000	I can get the three quarters through.
1377000	1380000	I've already written the mental blog entry of like
1380000	1382000	why this is the best movie ever
1382000	1385000	and the last 20 minutes can take a fucking nosedive
1385000	1387000	and I'll kind of just push it under the rug.
1387000	1389000	It was really enjoyable to watch.
1389000	1397000	The acting was great but I'll tell you where I really hit a roadblock
1397000	1401000	and it was a big one because I really was enjoying it up until this moment
1401000	1407000	but the scene with the theater reviewer, the dialogue was written.
1407000	1410000	It felt to me like the dialogue that she...
1410000	1413000	Her review and then the thing that he says back to her
1413000	1418000	and then her actual review later all sounded like somebody who's never read a review
1418000	1420000	because that's not how reviewers talk.
1420000	1424000	That's how when you parody or if you're like a sophomore in college
1424000	1427000	that's what you think a reviewer...
1427000	1429000	It was bogus.
1429000	1430000	That's a good point.
1430000	1433000	The Emma Stone monologue when she's yelling at him for giving a shit
1433000	1436000	about something that's all out of ego and he doesn't...
1436000	1439000	He pretends he's above Twitter but he's doing this ridiculous thing.
1439000	1441000	I thought that monologue was really great.
1441000	1444000	It was a well-written teenage daughter monologue yelling at her.
1444000	1446000	There's a lot of great stuff in there.
1446000	1450000	That was the one dialogue-wise.
1450000	1452000	That's not how they talk.
1452000	1454000	If they were as good at writing...
1454000	1456000	That reviewer could have easily just been super...
1456000	1461000	They could have written up to her and had her be a normal human with her own value system
1461000	1464000	as the hero of her own story with lots of thoughtful things to say
1464000	1466000	and it would have been just as good.
1466000	1467000	I didn't even think about that.
1467000	1468000	There is a way to hate things.
1468000	1470000	Thank you.
1470000	1473000	Did you guys see The Hobbit?
1478000	1480000	I saw the second movie and I was like...
1480000	1482000	The second of three?
1482000	1483000	Yeah.
1483000	1484000	It was one book, by the way.
1484000	1485000	I don't know if you guys know.
1485000	1486000	It was one book.
1486000	1487000	You can't make three movies out of one book.
1487000	1488000	It's so baffling.
1488000	1490000	I love the Lord of the Rings movies so much.
1490000	1492000	So each one of these I watch.
1492000	1494000	I said this on Twitter but to me,
1494000	1497000	Lord of the Rings was making love with the love of your life
1497000	1502000	and Hobbit is like jacking off on a sex doll you found in the trash.
1502000	1506000	It's still a fine way to spend your time.
1506000	1509000	You just don't want your wife to be around for one of them, you know?
1509000	1515000	Wait, are you jerking off in the exact place where you found the sex doll or do you bring it back?
1515000	1516000	No, it's still in the trash.
1516000	1517000	Oh, okay.
1517000	1520000	So to onlookers, you're just jacking off into the trash and you're like,
1520000	1522000	no, no, no, there's a sex doll in there.
1522000	1524000	Right, right, right.
1524000	1526000	A little bit of a thrill to it.
1526000	1528000	Yeah, there's an excitement to it.
1528000	1534000	There's a weird part where there's like, you know, there's like 15 new dwarves in it.
1534000	1537000	I haven't seen any of those things.
1537000	1541000	Not for, you know, not like out of anger or obstinance.
1541000	1544000	I just, those things are so silly and...
1544000	1546000	Even the original Lord of the Rings?
1546000	1547000	I didn't see him, no.
1547000	1548000	Okay.
1548000	1549000	Wait, oh gosh.
1549000	1550000	I didn't see him.
1550000	1553000	You're like a unicorn.
1553000	1554000	Ironically.
1554000	1558000	I mean, I don't get, I mean, I don't, no judgment.
1558000	1561000	I just know, I know myself enough to know I'm not going to like it.
1561000	1562000	Yeah, yeah.
1562000	1563000	So...
1563000	1568000	That's a good time to bring up that you now just finally, I say finally have launched a career as a director.
1568000	1573000	You just made that movie Hits, which I haven't seen and frankly didn't know existed,
1573000	1580000	which looks from the trailer to be like everything you would want when you hear that David Cross is directing.
1580000	1588000	Well, after the last 10 minutes of what I've just said, it better be the most amazing fucking perfect.
1588000	1591000	It has to be perfect.
1591000	1592000	But it looks great.
1592000	1598000	And more importantly, I think the reason why I thought you might want to come on here is because I'm sure you're already at your Kickstarter goal
1598000	1599000	because you're only asking for it.
1599000	1603000	Well, the Kickstarter pitch I saw was that you made this movie.
1603000	1605000	It's good.
1605000	1611000	The distributors involved had this plan to do like New York and L.A. and then throw it on iTunes and come up May.
1611000	1612000	Yep.
1612000	1614000	And, you know, whether, yeah.
1614000	1617000	And you're just going, come on, let's do the let's do the 20 city thing.
1617000	1621000	And you looked into it and it costs like a nominal amount.
1621000	1622000	They just wouldn't.
1622000	1625000	Nobody was interested in pursuing that.
1625000	1632000	And I'm not knocking the people involved, but they, you know, distributors are doing a job.
1632000	1634000	They don't care about the movie per se.
1634000	1642000	They want to get the best deal they can or at least the sales agents who you hire to represent you to make the deal with distributors, which I found out later.
1642000	1649000	I'm not I'm not well versed by choice in the business aspect of things.
1649000	1652000	I just don't care to.
1652000	1653000	I should care to know.
1653000	1656000	I'm sure my wife would be happier about that.
1656000	1658000	But I just don't.
1658000	1659000	I can't.
1659000	1664000	I don't want to think about those things and and.
1664000	1668000	And so the what they were what the offers were very good.
1668000	1670000	They were the absolute standard thing.
1670000	1678000	You know, like you were saying, it's New York and L.A. and then pick four cities out of the 10 biggest cities and they go there.
1678000	1685000	You know, one college town, you know, got to get it in Ann Harbor, man, you know, and and then that was it.
1686000	1689000	And that was really kind of depressing.
1689000	1697000	And then the producers were the ones who said, let's let's figure out a way to get this movie in theaters that would never play in.
1697000	1699000	And and so I credit them.
1699000	1702000	They're the ones who came up with the idea and they went to BitTorrent.
1702000	1708000	And and then we had the idea to do to do the Kickstarter, which just allows us to get the movie.
1708000	1710000	We're already at it.
1710000	1712000	Should it trigger.
1712000	1717000	We've got 35 cities, not even towns, places I've never even heard of.
1717000	1720000	Saint Saint Thompsonville in Vermont.
1720000	1723000	And I don't know.
1723000	1729000	Yeah, I mean, places it would never play like Daytona.
1729000	1733000	Just in the middle of the racetracks.
1733000	1735000	Yep. Just a guy with a tab.
1735000	1737000	The one guy who's not into racing and Daytona.
1737000	1739000	And he lives in the middle of the drivers.
1739000	1741000	And they can see it.
1741000	1742000	He's got it.
1742000	1745000	He's got it on his iPhone.
1745000	1749000	Bugs Bunny had that hill, that hole that they built a construction site around.
1749000	1751000	Yeah. And then in the future, he was the opposite.
1751000	1753000	He was the only guy.
1753000	1759000	So is it like these theaters sort of signed up to be like, hey, we wanted to play in our theaters.
1759000	1762000	So if this Kickstarter thing goes, then we would like to play.
1762000	1764000	Yeah, because it's pay what you want.
1764000	1768000	So in order to do that, we need at least enough money to get into the theater.
1768000	1770000	It doesn't cost a whole lot, but it does cost something.
1770000	1777000	You have to rent the theater, pay for the staff, make sure the film can play in their system.
1777000	1784000	And a small modicum of marketing and stuff gets mads out.
1784000	1791000	And that would allow us to go to, it was 22, I think we figured it would allow us to get to.
1791000	1795000	And now we're at all these theaters that have approached us.
1795000	1797000	And it's cool. It's never been done before.
1797000	1799000	Yeah, this is like I've never heard it.
1799000	1803000	And Bittorrent is the one who's distributing it online, you said, right?
1803000	1808000	This is the first movie that Bittorrent is putting out there.
1808000	1809000	Officially.
1809000	1810000	Officially.
1810000	1811000	Yeah.
1811000	1813000	After years in the business.
1813000	1814000	Yeah.
1814000	1815000	Before this, they put out...
1815000	1819000	How did they ever make any money?
1819000	1822000	Before this, they've put out every movie ever made.
1822000	1825000	Yeah.
1825000	1826000	Unofficially.
1826000	1828000	But that's such a cool...
1828000	1830000	How did the Bittorrent thing happen?
1830000	1833000	That was the producers. They're the ones who went out.
1833000	1836000	We were all little...
1836000	1839000	The movie screened well at Sundance.
1839000	1848000	And I don't think anybody had this illusion that we were going to somehow become this amazing...
1849000	1856000	One of those bidding war things where Harvey Weinstein is in between champagne shots and piles of blow.
1856000	1859000	He's like, I want this movie!
1859000	1862000	Skyping from his yacht on top of a mountain.
1865000	1867000	The yacht's on the mountain.
1867000	1868000	What?
1868000	1870000	The yacht's on the mountain.
1870000	1872000	He's very wealthy.
1872000	1875000	Yeah, it's his mountain also.
1876000	1879000	It's something his dad said he couldn't do.
1879000	1881000	It's the one thing.
1881000	1883000	Hey man, that's a good engine.
1883000	1886000	Trying to do shit your dad says you can't do.
1887000	1893000	So it's yeah, you were within spitting distance of your goal when I looked several days ago.
1893000	1896000	But more money is probably better than less if you're interested.
1896000	1899000	The more money we get, the more theaters we can go to.
1899000	1900000	Right, right.
1900000	1901000	So go to the Kickstarter if you're interested.
1901000	1903000	You can find it really easily.
1904000	1906000	First, give it to leukemia if you've got that money laying around.
1906000	1911000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1911000	1914000	See, that's short-sighted thinking.
1916000	1918000	Listen, his movie's coming out once.
1918000	1920000	Leukemia's gonna be there.
1920000	1923000	Leukemia I'll Keep is the slogan for the movie.
1923000	1925000	Don't worry.
1925000	1929000	I mean, $100 to the Leukemia Foundation.
1929000	1931000	I mean, that's nothing.
1931000	1932000	That's nothing.
1932000	1933000	No.
1933000	1939000	And $100 to us, you're gonna make some loser with leukemia laugh for two hours, you know?
1941000	1944000	I mean, give him a little escape.
1944000	1948000	Two of the last hours of his life, he'll laugh.
1950000	1954000	It's 2015, so now we have to follow that with a paragraph of,
1954000	1957000	we're not saying it's funny to have leukemia.
1957000	1961000	We're saying it's so unfunny to have it that it's funny and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1962000	1965000	I understand that the money that goes to leukemia,
1965000	1969000	a lot of times what happens is because it's such an intense diagnosis to give
1969000	1973000	that a lot of times they'll just give the person $100 along with the...
1974000	1976000	Hey, good news and bad news.
1976000	1980000	So that is a furnace that you're shoveling your money into.
1980000	1986000	It needs to be shoveled in, but you could light a little dollar bill on fire for David Cross
1986000	1988000	and it'll go a lot longer.
1989000	1993000	Well, we really did make a pretty...
1993000	1998000	We made a point that was like, hey, give to his movie more than give to leukemia,
1998000	2000000	and it made sense.
2002000	2006000	Yeah, I mean, that's the great thing about this podcast,
2006000	2010000	is if you pay attention you might learn something.
2012000	2014000	The movie's called Hits.
2014000	2015000	It's called Hits, right?
2015000	2016000	Called Hits, yes.
2016000	2019000	So is there ever going to be a rule about...
2019000	2021000	So you got your...
2022000	2026000	You got your hebedo deaths with more of the Muhammad thing.
2026000	2028000	This is a fuck of a segue.
2031000	2033000	And so this isn't the first time it's happened,
2033000	2035000	and this thing keeps coming up where it's like,
2035000	2039000	okay, so some people get really upset about the fact that, for instance,
2039000	2041000	okay, so these guys are...
2041000	2045000	A cartoon made them hurt people and that obviously makes them the bad guy,
2045000	2047000	but then why CNN?
2047000	2050000	Well, you're doing the story and then you hold up the cartoon as it blurred out.
2050000	2052000	And then there's other people...
2052000	2054000	Because I don't want to jump on that bandwagon and go,
2054000	2056000	well, but wait a minute.
2056000	2057000	You're watching CNN.
2057000	2061000	What are you, a big fan of overriding all societal taboo?
2061000	2063000	Because otherwise there would just be...
2063000	2066000	You know what a corporation would put on TV to make you keep watching?
2066000	2069000	It would just be a big dick with toothpaste coming out of it.
2069000	2072000	If you didn't give a fuck, they wouldn't give a fuck.
2072000	2075000	It would just be twinkies and fucking tits on the TV and they would...
2075000	2078000	No, go back to the dick with toothpaste coming out of it.
2079000	2082000	I backed off of that because that's a pitch that I'm trying to sell.
2084000	2086000	Well, what kind of toothpaste did you guys see?
2086000	2088000	Did you guys see stripes red and white?
2088000	2092000	Did you guys see sparkly bubblegum like kid toothpaste?
2092000	2094000	Red and white stripes would be gross.
2094000	2096000	Right, that's crazy.
2096000	2098000	And I want to...
2102000	2105000	I don't want to see a red stripe coming out of my dick.
2105000	2109000	But you want to see other kind of toothpaste coming out of your dick?
2109000	2116000	If I came and it didn't hurt and it was blue with crystals in it,
2116000	2121000	I would be like, whoa, what the fuck?
2121000	2126000	But if there was a red stripe in it, I'd be like, fuck!
2126000	2128000	There's a difference.
2128000	2131000	You don't think the crystals are going to hurt the inside of your urethra?
2131000	2132000	So naive.
2132000	2133000	I just said it didn't hurt.
2133000	2135000	That's why I prefaced it with not hurting because...
2135000	2136000	Okay, I did say that.
2136000	2139000	I would think you're more of a Tom's guy.
2142000	2144000	Given your druthers.
2144000	2146000	I don't even come.
2146000	2150000	The head of my dick is one of those crystals you just rub it on your skin
2151000	2154000	I switched to deodorant.
2154000	2156000	But finish that sentence.
2156000	2160000	It didn't make sense because I switched to deodorant analogy and it doesn't make sense.
2160000	2162000	Finish the sentence.
2162000	2163000	The deodorant.
2163000	2165000	Yeah, that's so you don't get Alzheimer's.
2165000	2168000	So when you masturbate, you don't get Alzheimer's.
2168000	2169000	Right.
2169000	2170000	Or you do.
2170000	2171000	No, it is the crystal.
2171000	2172000	Oh, no, the crystal...
2172000	2173000	All right, all right.
2173000	2178000	The crystal deodorant is because people are afraid because somebody read something
2178000	2182000	somewhere 15 years ago and they're like, oh, shit, this has aluminum in it.
2182000	2184000	That's going to give us Alzheimer's.
2184000	2186000	So give me that rock.
2188000	2195000	Give me the rock that the woman who calls herself a good witch sold me on Venice Beach for $60.
2196000	2197000	There's a witchcraft store.
2197000	2202000	There was a witchcraft store in my neighborhood where they would sell bullshit like that
2202000	2204000	and it just shut down and now it's a shoe store.
2204000	2207000	And I was kind of happy and sad at the same time.
2207000	2209000	Because it's like, kind of fuck that woman.
2209000	2212000	But also, I could buy shoes anywhere.
2212000	2214000	But here's the thing.
2214000	2215000	Here's the thing about those folks.
2215000	2217000	I don't think they're...
2217000	2219000	You don't think they're hucksters?
2219000	2220000	No, I don't.
2220000	2221000	I don't think a lot of...
2221000	2227000	The people that I think about when I think of those women or guys on Venice Beach
2227000	2231000	or in Woodstock or San Francisco, wherever the fuck they are,
2231000	2237000	I don't think they're trying to rip you off.
2237000	2238000	I really don't.
2238000	2243000	I think they're naive and dumb, sort of.
2245000	2247000	Because they believe those things.
2247000	2253000	But now I'm getting close to describing people in my life that I love.
2253000	2255000	So I can't...
2255000	2257000	I have to step it back a notch.
2257000	2263000	What a pin in my...
2263000	2267000	So you're holding up a picture of Muhammad on the news.
2267000	2268000	And they're blurring it out.
2268000	2272000	This got really derailed by the toothpaste out of the dick thing, huh?
2272000	2275000	So now next to that, somebody tweeted me this story, which I didn't know was a thing.
2275000	2279000	If you live in New York and you go back and forth between New York and Israel,
2279000	2281000	I don't know how long this has been a thing,
2281000	2283000	but someone tweeted me an article about how it's a thing.
2283000	2284000	It's a thing?
2284000	2285000	The Haredi?
2285000	2286000	Yes.
2286000	2290000	Can I put a quick plug for a website?
2290000	2292000	Seriously, I'm not joking.
2292000	2295000	There's a website called failed messiah.com.
2295000	2302000	And I am one of the very few people who says that we should make more fun of Jews.
2302000	2303000	And I...
2303000	2305000	Not reform Jews, they're boring.
2305000	2307000	But I'm talking about Orthodox Jews.
2307000	2314000	They're just awful, terrible, backwards people that they really are.
2314000	2317000	Sexist.
2317000	2319000	And there's a lot of...
2319000	2321000	They're just terrible.
2321000	2323000	And there's...
2323000	2327000	But they're always linked to those articles.
2327000	2328000	Right.
2328000	2329000	And I think...
2329000	2332000	So there's a theme that we constantly see happen.
2332000	2333000	What is the article about?
2333000	2337000	Well, the article that I read was an editorial by somebody that was just fed up
2337000	2338000	and just going like,
2338000	2340000	enough already, can we make this fucking illegal?
2340000	2342000	You cannot obstruct a goddamn...
2342000	2343000	Tell them what the deal is.
2343000	2344000	What is it?
2344000	2345000	Yeah, I don't understand that.
2345000	2347000	Okay, so if I'm explaining this correctly,
2347000	2348000	there's a...
2348000	2354000	As you get into the more Orthodox forms of Judaism,
2354000	2355000	depending on what sect,
2355000	2357000	I don't know if I'm using the right language,
2357000	2358000	but there's some dudes...
2358000	2360000	It's a Hasidim, the Haredi.
2360000	2362000	There's different factions of all...
2362000	2364000	If you're ultra-Orthodox.
2364000	2366000	And they're all kinds of ultra-Orthodox.
2366000	2367000	And they can't...
2367000	2369000	They get on the plane and they go,
2369000	2373000	oh, I can't sit next to a woman.
2373000	2375000	But not, I can't.
2375000	2376000	I won't.
2376000	2377000	Right, right.
2377000	2378000	And so something...
2378000	2380000	You know, you read the comments section.
2380000	2381000	It's like, on fire.
2381000	2383000	And it all kind of comes down to me for like,
2383000	2384000	well, how...
2384000	2386000	Is this guy an 18-year-old traveler?
2386000	2389000	And like, is this really the first time that he's...
2389000	2392000	You know, is he actually being brave, this person?
2392000	2393000	And it's going like, oh, shit.
2393000	2396000	I'm being pressured by this secular machine
2396000	2397000	to do this thing.
2397000	2399000	No one warned me about this.
2399000	2401000	When I read the article, I was like,
2401000	2404000	this stinks of airlines need to nut up.
2404000	2406000	Like corporations that we give all this power to.
2406000	2408000	Yeah, stop letting women on your plane.
2408000	2414000	Well, put a fucking sign up explaining to anyone
2414000	2416000	flying from New York to Israel or vice versa
2416000	2418000	that there is a very likely chance
2418000	2420000	you will be sitting next to half the population.
2420000	2422000	50% chance.
2422000	2428000	Well, you know, there are also 0.001% of the population
2428000	2431000	who still believes in this archaic thing.
2431000	2432000	Right.
2432000	2434000	But we accept it.
2434000	2436000	And one of the issues,
2436000	2438000	and I didn't read this particular editorial,
2438000	2441000	but I know one of the issues is that,
2441000	2444000	in particular, it was Delta Airlines.
2444000	2445000	They don't want to lose their business
2445000	2447000	because it is a lot of their business.
2447000	2448000	That's exactly what I'm saying.
2448000	2450000	It always ends up being money.
2450000	2451000	It's never this difficult West Wing thing
2451000	2453000	where it's like, well, what's the right thing to do?
2453000	2454000	It's money.
2454000	2455000	Fuck you.
2455000	2456000	Follow the money and somebody's being greedy
2456000	2457000	by not explaining to these people.
2457000	2459000	And it's fucking awful what they do,
2459000	2461000	what they let them get away with.
2461000	2464000	And eventually, people are pressured.
2464000	2467000	And it's a major flight in New York to Israel, you know.
2467000	2468000	It's a long...
2468000	2470000	But, I mean, it's like, if you've got to get there,
2470000	2472000	I assume you have to get there for a reason.
2472000	2474000	You're not like, I've got a couple days to go.
2475000	2477000	So, eventually, people are like,
2477000	2480000	fine, I'll give them my fucking seat.
2483000	2485000	I mean, I think that the...
2485000	2487000	I put those side by side for one
2487000	2490000	because I don't want anybody to perceive me talking about,
2490000	2491000	we've got to figure this out
2491000	2494000	as having to do with any particular religion.
2494000	2496000	I think that all of religion
2496000	2500000	in its most concentrated forms,
2500000	2502000	the word archaic could be used
2503000	2504000	because it's like, let's face it,
2504000	2505000	these are being held over
2505000	2507000	from times before airplanes and things.
2507000	2510000	And so, they're rubbing up against modern,
2510000	2512000	completely secularized society.
2512000	2514000	It's like, what are the rules?
2514000	2515000	Because we're all wearing pants.
2515000	2517000	And if you get on a plane without pants
2517000	2519000	and you say, it's my religion,
2519000	2521000	they're going to say, I don't give a shit.
2521000	2524000	And so, I want people to fess up
2524000	2527000	that it's not really about freedom of religion
2527000	2530000	if an airline is kowtowing to...
2530000	2531000	Yeah, fuck that anyway.
2532000	2534000	I mean, because if it was,
2534000	2536000	I would be like, well, okay,
2536000	2537000	let's try really hard to figure out
2537000	2540000	how nobody ever, ever has their bubble birds.
2540000	2541000	Let's try.
2541000	2543000	Let's try and see if we can do it, make it happen.
2543000	2546000	But we'll do it in tears so that some,
2546000	2547000	for instance, some poor woman
2547000	2549000	who didn't buy a ticket to this fucking ride,
2549000	2550000	or if she bought a ticket to the plane,
2550000	2552000	but not this goddamn global roller coaster,
2552000	2553000	gets on a plane,
2553000	2555000	has a guy in an Indiana Jones hat,
2555000	2556000	get on the plane,
2556000	2557000	look at her,
2557000	2558000	stifle vomit,
2558000	2560000	go to the flight attendant,
2560000	2562000	double back, fall back into the...
2562000	2563000	I mean, what do these people do
2563000	2564000	when they're sealed in this tube?
2564000	2566000	There's women everywhere.
2566000	2569000	And it starts explaining that they can't do this
2569000	2570000	and they can't do that,
2570000	2571000	and everyone on the plane is like,
2571000	2572000	what the fuck?
2572000	2574000	Like he said, I'm on a goddamn deadline.
2574000	2576000	I got a whale at this wall.
2579000	2580000	Or actually, that's the one thing
2580000	2581000	I don't have to do, right?
2581000	2582000	The wall wails for you?
2582000	2583000	Is that...
2583000	2584000	I don't know.
2584000	2585000	I only know it by name.
2585000	2586000	The wailing wall?
2586000	2587000	I think it's...
2587000	2589000	I know you go and you dive in and you pray
2589000	2591000	and then you put prayer slips
2591000	2594000	into the cracks in the wall.
2594000	2596000	And then at night,
2596000	2598000	between midnight and 12.05 a.m.,
2598000	2600000	God tiptoes in.
2600000	2602000	They seal it up.
2602000	2605000	And God tiptoes in.
2605000	2608000	And He...
2608000	2610000	He and Muhammad and Jesus
2610000	2613000	go to the Dome of the Rock, right?
2613000	2614000	Where they all had...
2614000	2618000	There were the three major world religions
2618000	2620000	that have claimed to that,
2620000	2621000	the Dome of the Rock,
2621000	2622000	and then they...
2622000	2623000	On the Temple Mount.
2623000	2625000	And then they each go in there,
2625000	2627000	and it's all...
2627000	2628000	They've reduced...
2628000	2629000	They've figured out,
2629000	2631000	science has figured out that...
2631000	2633000	They've reduced it to the actual grain of sand
2633000	2635000	that each one can claim to.
2635000	2637000	And then they all go and they...
2637000	2639000	This is between 12 and 12.05.
2639000	2642000	They lick the grain of sand.
2642000	2643000	They lick it?
2643000	2644000	They lick it.
2644000	2647000	And then they wink to each other.
2648000	2649000	They give a little pat on the backside,
2649000	2651000	and then they go their separate way.
2651000	2652000	And they go...
2652000	2653000	They're like,
2653000	2656000	What a racket, huh?
2656000	2658000	True story.
2658000	2659000	I wanna...
2659000	2660000	I wanna start a religion
2660000	2662000	where if you're a woman on a plane,
2662000	2667000	you have to sit next to an Orthodox Jew.
2667000	2670000	And then let's see what happens.
2670000	2672000	I... Yeah, I mean, there's a...
2672000	2673000	You know, there's the thing of what...
2673000	2674000	You run an experiment.
2674000	2675000	We'll start your own airline,
2675000	2676000	but it's like, what is that, a mandate?
2676000	2677000	We all gotta be, like, fucking sick.
2677000	2678000	They have one.
2678000	2679000	It's called L.O.
2679000	2680000	Get on fucking L.O.
2680000	2681000	Yeah.
2681000	2682000	So, okay, so...
2682000	2683000	Wait, what's L.O.?
2683000	2684000	I think the panel...
2684000	2686000	Israel's...
2686000	2689000	I mean, Israel being a secular country,
2689000	2691000	it's their airline.
2691000	2692000	Their national airline.
2692000	2693000	Oh, okay.
2693000	2694000	Yeah.
2694000	2695000	And what are the...
2695000	2696000	Okay, so if...
2696000	2699000	This is a hugely important question.
2699000	2701000	What did they do on that airline?
2701000	2703000	They must be no strangers to this concept.
2703000	2705000	So they must have a speedy way of dealing with it.
2705000	2706000	And what is that?
2706000	2707000	I don't know.
2707000	2708000	I've never been on that flight,
2708000	2709000	nor would I ever...
2709000	2710000	I know.
2710000	2712000	It was more of a rhetorical question.
2712000	2714000	I'm saying, like, this is the question that needs to be asked.
2714000	2715000	I don't know.
2715000	2717000	Like, okay, what do the experts do
2717000	2721000	that are in charge of both expedient aviation
2721000	2725000	and, you know, not offending...
2725000	2728000	Here's the core of what bothers me about this situation,
2728000	2730000	is they have the ability,
2730000	2733000	because they buy their tickets and blocks,
2734000	2736000	and they travel together in groups,
2736000	2741000	they have the ability to buy seats around them
2741000	2743000	or make sure that they're all sitting next to each other
2743000	2745000	and not delay the flight.
2745000	2747000	But they truly don't care.
2747000	2749000	And part of the reason they don't care
2749000	2752000	is because they are led to believe that they are pure
2752000	2755000	and they are better than everyone on that plane
2755000	2756000	who's not in an orthodox view.
2756000	2757000	They're better.
2757000	2760000	God views them as better people.
2760000	2762000	Those other people are not worthy.
2762000	2765000	And so they don't even care.
2765000	2768000	That's part of the mindset that bothers me.
2768000	2773000	You think they know in advance.
2773000	2774000	They're like, well, we're going to get on the plane,
2774000	2776000	there's going to be some chicks, and we're going to have to...
2776000	2777000	Of course they do.
2777000	2778000	We're going to hold everybody up.
2778000	2780000	That's pretty insidious.
2780000	2782000	I mean, it's like your religion starts to...
2782000	2789000	They could take a simple action to not...
2789000	2791000	To protect their own little corner of the world.
2791000	2794000	And also to be a decent human being
2794000	2798000	amongst other human beings in a live and let live way
2798000	2800000	to be accommodating, to be polite,
2800000	2803000	to have civil discourse.
2803000	2805000	They could do that, should they want.
2805000	2807000	But they don't.
2807000	2809000	And they don't care to.
2809000	2811000	I think there's something that...
2811000	2816000	I'll move off of this hot oven with this.
2816000	2818000	This conversation confirms my thought.
2818000	2820000	I'm more prone to...
2820000	2824000	I mean, Kumail was raised a Muslim,
2824000	2826000	but is not practicing. Is that accurate?
2826000	2839000	What if he is gone?
2839000	2842000	That'd be amazing.
2842000	2845000	I like the idea of someone who's so against
2845000	2848000	orthodox Judaism, but must have come on.
2848000	2850000	No, it's a razor thin wire.
2850000	2853000	This guy walks theologically.
2853000	2856000	There actually is a razor thin wire in Islam
2856000	2858000	where that's how you get to heaven.
2858000	2860000	You have to cross the razor thin wire
2860000	2861000	and if you fall down, you go to hell.
2861000	2862000	That's actually true.
2862000	2863000	That's actually...
2863000	2864000	That's so weird because...
2864000	2868000	Well, that makes sense scientifically.
2868000	2873000	That I get. That I understand.
2873000	2875000	You guys, I think...
2875000	2877000	Yeah, I'm not gonna get any argument out of you
2877000	2879000	when I say something that...
2879000	2881000	Some valve in my body makes me go,
2881000	2883000	well, don't say it all the way
2883000	2885000	because to some degree, I feel like I'm speaking
2885000	2887000	on behalf of a lot of people that I don't like
2887000	2888000	when I say this.
2888000	2889000	A lot of organizations.
2889000	2892000	A lot of the world around us that I don't like
2892000	2896000	when I say, yeah, get over your boogeymen
2896000	2898000	to the extent that it's going to affect other people.
2898000	2899000	You just gotta.
2899000	2902000	There has to be this global recognition
2902000	2904000	that if you're Amish,
2904000	2907000	you can be as Amish as you want on your Amish farm
2907000	2909000	and unfortunately, it's like still,
2909000	2911000	you're being marginalized and you're being disempowered
2911000	2913000	but we gotta move on with this fucking planet.
2913000	2915000	We gotta get off it before it dies.
2915000	2917000	We do that with lasers.
2917000	2920000	You say lasers are bad luck.
2920000	2923000	We don't believe you.
2923000	2925000	I gotta get to work.
2925000	2928000	I'm a woman.
2928000	2930000	I'm not gonna grow a dick.
2930000	2933000	I gotta invent a laser in Israel.
2933000	2936000	So I think that it's like we have made that choice
2936000	2940000	but we also feel very queasy about saying it
2940000	2941000	because we...
2941000	2942000	I don't.
2942000	2944000	I think that's admirable.
2944000	2946000	I do because it actually is like,
2946000	2947000	it's easier to do what I'm doing,
2947000	2949000	which is be Alan Alda.
2949000	2957000	I appreciate the, let's be civil about this.
2957000	2958000	Let's listen to all sides.
2958000	2959000	Let's think about this
2959000	2963000	but I didn't have this early on
2963000	2965000	and now at 50, I really don't have it
2965000	2971000	and I live in an area upstate in New York
2971000	2974000	and it's one of the poorest,
2974000	2978000	it's near one of the poorest counties
2978000	2981000	and it's the poorest county because there's a place called,
2981000	2983000	I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly,
2983000	2987000	Curious Joel and it's where
2987000	2991000	tens of thousands of Orthodox come in
2991000	2996000	and they breed like fucking Catholic rabbits
2996000	3003000	and they're sapping the public services
3003000	3006000	and the monies that are,
3006000	3009000	and they're nine to a room in public housing
3010000	3012000	and they have their own,
3012000	3015000	they won't let police,
3015000	3019000	it's crazy and I wish I had more solid anecdotal stuff
3019000	3023000	but they're really rude.
3023000	3025000	If you ever have an interaction with them,
3025000	3028000	they're really rude and they will not acknowledge you
3028000	3031000	and if, God forbid, you're a woman
3031000	3034000	and you hold the door open for them
3034000	3035000	like in a market or something,
3035000	3037000	they just won't even acknowledge you.
3038000	3039000	And that's the big deal breaker,
3039000	3040000	it's like half the population is women,
3040000	3042000	women's rights is like, that's the kind of fun.
3042000	3044000	What they do to their own women is criminal,
3044000	3046000	that shit is criminal.
3046000	3049000	And that's, I think, going to be finally,
3049000	3052000	the interesting thing about it is that women who,
3052000	3055000	we freed slaves and let them vote before we
3055000	3058000	finally, somehow, begrudgingly found it in ourselves
3058000	3060000	to say that women could partake inside.
3060000	3063000	Well that I get if you watch any of the Real Housewives shows.
3063000	3066000	I mean there's a point that it's valid.
3066000	3068000	And a lot of the slaves had dicks,
3068000	3071000	which is where the voting power comes from.
3071000	3073000	But it'll be amazing the fact that women are actually
3073000	3075000	kind of like this weird shield slash weapon
3075000	3078000	that is the final decision maker in the battle
3078000	3081000	that's very difficult to have between,
3081000	3085000	look, there's eight billion of us now,
3085000	3088000	are we going to keep entertaining this notion
3088000	3091000	that every single fucking conception
3091000	3094000	gets to have its own barbed wire fence around it
3094000	3097000	protected by every goddamn thing.
3097000	3100000	If you believe in this society that if somebody's
3100000	3103000	hitting their wife, no matter where they're living,
3103000	3106000	that they're supposed to stop hitting their wife,
3106000	3108000	then we all agree that we have to like,
3108000	3111000	then there's certain freedoms that we have been protecting
3111000	3113000	that may have to kind of erode under the-
3113000	3116000	Yeah, but the problem is the people you're talking about,
3116000	3119000	you're talking to the people that, I mean,
3119000	3121000	I don't, probably not a lot of people in this room
3121000	3124000	or listen to this podcast, but most people in America
3124000	3126000	and most people in other countries are religious
3126000	3131000	and they have a different but equally kind of crazy notion.
3131000	3136000	And so if anybody points to what is markedly
3136000	3141000	near criminal behavior from certain orthodox Jews and sex,
3141000	3144000	then the finger's going to be pointed to them
3144000	3147000	and then it's a slippery slope, it dominoes down.
3147000	3150000	Do you think they're thinking that far ahead, those people?
3150000	3153000	Aren't those people the ones you can really count on?
3153000	3155000	If I go to Billy Graham's audience and go,
3155000	3157000	hey, who wants to make laws against praying
3157000	3159000	to a different God than yours, don't you think
3159000	3160000	they'd sign up immediately?
3160000	3162000	And then I could go, gotcha.
3162000	3164000	I don't know if they're- are they like,
3164000	3166000	whoa, stay your hand, Jebediah.
3166000	3168000	It's the classic trap.
3168000	3169000	I think they're-
3169000	3171000	Oh, we love Islam.
3171000	3173000	Yeah, come on.
3173000	3176000	That was a lot of stereotypes I made in a whole-
3176000	3187000	No, I think that there is- if you said,
3187000	3189000	hey, I've got this magic piece of paper,
3189000	3191000	if you sign this, then this thing will happen,
3191000	3193000	then people will sign it happily.
3193000	3195000	But it just doesn't work that way.
3195000	3200000	And I think, let's go back to Islam,
3200000	3203000	which is obviously the much more-
3203000	3205000	Be very careful.
3205000	3213000	It's the more- it's the king of beers.
3213000	3218000	It's the flashpoint, you know, it's the easy one.
3218000	3224000	It's the easy one to make fun of and use as an example.
3224000	3225000	And ask questions about it.
3225000	3227000	Like, yeah, look at the examined line
3227000	3229000	between what we perceive as women's rights,
3229000	3232000	human rights across the planet,
3232000	3235000	and freedom of religion.
3235000	3240000	Yes, but I'm happy to say- I have zero power,
3240000	3242000	but I'm happy to say it's all wrong.
3242000	3243000	It's all bullshit.
3243000	3246000	It all should be- I mean, certain behaviors should be outlawed
3246000	3249000	in a free thinking society.
3249000	3250000	I think if it affects other people.
3250000	3251000	Yeah, absolutely.
3251000	3253000	I mean, someone has to stand up and say,
3253000	3255000	we are a human planet now.
3256000	3259000	When Jesus said, render unto Caesar, what is Caesar's?
3259000	3261000	Because they were trying to get him in gotcha scenarios,
3261000	3263000	where they're like, well, are you going to pay taxes, bro?
3263000	3264000	Because if you are, isn't that kind of like,
3264000	3265000	pray unto Caesar?
3265000	3267000	And he's like, if I'm interpreting this passage, right?
3267000	3270000	He's like, don't try to catch me in that shit.
3270000	3272000	You can be a really holy person in your living room,
3272000	3274000	and pay your taxes, go ahead.
3274000	3277000	Revolution is not going to happen because you ran up
3277000	3279000	the court steps and spit in someone's eye, necessarily.
3279000	3281000	I'm not telling you not to do that either.
3281000	3284000	But Caesar made the fucking money.
3284000	3285000	Caesar loves the money.
3285000	3287000	Give him Caesar's fucking money.
3287000	3291000	Let's get back to talking about this other shit.
3291000	3297000	Like that idea extended to a now, like we are, I mean,
3297000	3298000	atheism wins.
3301000	3307000	You look into space, and we need to continue
3307000	3309000	to have a relationship with the fact
3309000	3312000	that we're psycho monkeys that don't know what we're doing.
3312000	3315000	I want to go back to something you said before I was even
3315000	3317000	brought up here, and you were talking about gay rights,
3317000	3326000	and you were talking about why would straight, homophobic men
3326000	3333000	not allow gay marriage, and if, by proxy,
3333000	3336000	just tolerate homosexuals in society.
3336000	3340000	And I think the answer, I don't know this isn't,
3340000	3343000	I've got no scientific basis in this,
3343000	3350000	but those are people with some form of religious training.
3350000	3352000	Right, that's what I was saying, exactly.
3352000	3355000	I don't think, I don't wear my atheism on my sleeve
3355000	3358000	if I do a show like this, which I don't do that often.
3358000	3360000	I'm happy to mention it.
3360000	3364000	If you get me in a bar or a pub, and we've got a couple pints,
3364000	3365000	I'll fucking scream to the raptors.
3365000	3368000	But I don't belong to an atheist society.
3368000	3369000	I'm not a spokesman.
3369000	3374000	I firmly, vehemently believe in my belief.
3374000	3377000	There's no belief, dude.
3377000	3381000	You just fucked yourself with your words.
3381000	3387000	I imagine an orthodox Jew saying that to you in that voice.
3387000	3390000	Yeah, he just converted.
3390000	3392000	Yeah, but he's in it to win it.
3392000	3396000	But no, one of the things that makes me proud to be an atheist
3396000	3400000	is I, oddly enough, because those people can't understand it,
3400000	3402000	is I am tolerant.
3402000	3404000	I'm not tolerant of people who aren't intolerant,
3404000	3408000	but I don't know of any atheists who go,
3408000	3411000	man, fucking fags really weird me out.
3411000	3415000	I think gays shouldn't be allowed to marry.
3415000	3417000	I think it's wrong.
3417000	3420000	I think it goes against everything that's natural.
3420000	3422000	It's like, well, who taught you that?
3422000	3423000	Who told you that?
3423000	3425000	Me!
3425000	3428000	You just don't.
3428000	3430000	Atheists don't do that.
3430000	3432000	That's a really, really...
3432000	3435000	I'm sure that point's been pounded at me a lot,
3435000	3437000	but it just sunk in.
3437000	3441000	That is a huge, just very anecdotal but powerful example
3441000	3445000	in favor of atheism's evangelism.
3445000	3448000	My pet peeve is evangelical atheists.
3448000	3450000	I don't like them either.
3450000	3453000	They're not just defending women from being abused
3454000	3456000	under the guise of religion.
3456000	3458000	They're bothering to say,
3458000	3460000	and that's why if you're in Kmart
3460000	3462000	and you think that if you genuflect
3462000	3464000	you might get a better lottery pick,
3464000	3466000	you're an asshole and should die.
3466000	3468000	It's kind of like, you don't need to.
3468000	3471000	Let's clean up the living room one potted plant at a time.
3471000	3474000	I agree with a lot of what you guys are saying,
3474000	3477000	but also there's a lot of people who are very religious
3477000	3479000	who are doing the right kinds of things
3479000	3482000	in that they're not infringing on other people's rights,
3482000	3484000	whatever you believe that gets you through the day,
3484000	3487000	if you think it's rubbing a stone in your armpit,
3487000	3490000	we'll stop it from sweating and not give you Alzheimer's
3490000	3493000	or that there's a God that's watching out for you.
3493000	3496000	Also, there's so much beautiful human mythology
3496000	3499000	arriving out of the core need for it,
3499000	3501000	which is that when you become a conscious mammal,
3501000	3503000	before you have a microscope to tell you anything,
3503000	3505000	and by the way, what you find in the microscope
3505000	3508000	ain't that heartening, but before you even have that,
3508000	3510000	it is a fucked up thing to realize as a mammal
3510000	3512000	that you are alive and that you're gonna die.
3512000	3515000	And six million years before, well, okay,
3515000	3517000	that's going back a little far,
3517000	3521000	three million years before you get to be somewhat comforted
3521000	3523000	by the fact that milk can be pasteurized,
3523000	3527000	like you're alone in a dark world
3527000	3530000	that basically on the fundamental level still to this day
3530000	3533000	fucks you up in the same way, which is like,
3533000	3536000	I start to love my wife,
3536000	3539000	like I was holding her hand in couples therapy
3539000	3542000	and the therapist was asking me what I think about
3542000	3544000	when I hold her hand and I burst into tears
3544000	3547000	and said I think about the fact that one of us is going to die.
3547000	3550000	That's existence, and that is something that we use
3550000	3552000	mythology with which to cope with.
3552000	3554000	This is what we were talking about earlier today, right?
3554000	3557000	You and I, we were like, nothing really means anything.
3557000	3560000	If you look at how insignificant we are in the universe,
3560000	3562000	nothing we do means anything.
3562000	3564000	We lie to ourselves, we tell us that we do podcasts
3564000	3566000	and that's important and we make movies and TV shows
3566000	3568000	and that's how we get through today
3568000	3570000	the lies we tell ourselves and then some people
3570000	3571000	tell different lies.
3571000	3574000	As long as they don't infringe on my lies, that's fine.
3574000	3578000	And the cancer comes in when you say,
3578000	3580000	you're not allowed to say lies.
3580000	3581000	You can't say that.
3581000	3582000	What do you mean it's a lie?
3582000	3584000	That's where the problem starts.
3584000	3587000	Joseph Campbell said when religion loses its transparency,
3587000	3589000	when it becomes opaque, when you start looking
3589000	3591000	at the stained glass window like it's like a thing
3591000	3593000	that has a use instead of just looking at it like,
3593000	3595000	this is a neat way to frame something we don't understand
3595000	3597000	and couldn't otherwise see unless it was decorated
3597000	3600000	with this fun fucking flimsy transparent shit.
3600000	3605000	Like in this dance we do, when we're shooting people
3605000	3607000	because our religion has rules,
3607000	3609000	that should be your first indication in my opinion
3609000	3610000	that that is not a religion.
3610000	3612000	You are not practicing a religion.
3612000	3614000	You are practicing something much more real than religion.
3614000	3618000	Religion's bottle says there should not be bullets involved
3618000	3620000	because that's politics.
3620000	3622000	Politics bottle says buy bullets.
3622000	3624000	It comes with bullets in the bottle.
3624000	3625000	I think you're wrong.
3625000	3629000	I wish that was true, but I think religion is bullets.
3629000	3632000	I think religion has become bullets.
3632000	3635000	But maybe we could both agree that politics is the one
3635000	3638000	that exploits that aspect of religion and keeps it going,
3638000	3641000	whereas religion could be your lucky rabbit foot.
3641000	3644000	Or power, maybe.
3644000	3652000	But religion certainly can be a violent...
3652000	3654000	What are you talking about?
3654000	3665000	Give me one example of religion ever causing any violence.
3665000	3672000	All right, well, let's soften up this hard penis-like conversation
3672000	3676000	about open-mindedness and the importance of our policy
3676000	3679000	regarding religion with the soft, acquiescent,
3679000	3682000	intuitive influence of my wife's vagina.
3682000	3696000	Please welcome Erin McGathey.
3696000	3697000	Can you feel it?
3697000	3698000	Oh, yeah.
3698000	3702000	The vibrations of my vagina.
3702000	3703000	Any thoughts, sweetie?
3703000	3708000	You've been listening.
3708000	3711000	I love it.
3711000	3714000	I feel like you haven't been listening.
3714000	3719000	I mean, just the thing when he said that and you just...
3719000	3720000	Ah, so good.
3720000	3722000	I remember when I was first dating Erin,
3722000	3725000	we went back to my place and you insisted on playing
3725000	3732000	a 10-minute David Cross bit about gold foil being used on desserts.
3732000	3734000	And we just sat and listened to it.
3734000	3737000	We were listening to Grateful Dead or something.
3737000	3739000	I think it was like a little test, right?
3739000	3741000	Like, if I had gone, oh, I don't know,
3741000	3743000	gold foil's pretty cool on desserts.
3743000	3745000	You would have dumped me.
3745000	3749000	My dad is a Baptist minister,
3749000	3752000	and when I was in college, I cleaned houses,
3752000	3755000	and the thing that I listened to over and over again was,
3755000	3756000	shut up, you fucking baby.
3756000	3758000	You're 2002.
3758000	3759000	Which I wasn't going to mention.
3759000	3761000	I was going to be real cool,
3761000	3763000	and not say that I was a big man.
3763000	3767000	But I feel very empowered by David Cross's atheism
3768000	3771000	and not challenged by it.
3771000	3775000	In 2002, I was 17 years old.
3775000	3777000	I feel like an idiot, but I've never connected those dots.
3777000	3779000	There are very...
3781000	3783000	11.
3783000	3788000	Atheism has harder work to do to connect to things
3788000	3790000	like misogyny and homophobia.
3790000	3792000	That's the hard thing, is religion.
3792000	3794000	You have to buy and do all this crazy shit.
3794000	3796000	All right, what do I get in return?
3796000	3799000	You get to go to heaven, and it's rivers of milk,
3799000	3801000	and all the babes you can fuck,
3801000	3804000	and that's the promise of religion, right?
3804000	3806000	Atheism is like, this is all the race,
3806000	3808000	but we can have fun, and it'll make sense,
3808000	3811000	and then you die and everything goes away.
3811000	3813000	I feel very empowered by...
3813000	3815000	I wouldn't consider myself an atheist,
3815000	3818000	but I feel very empowered by humanism
3818000	3822000	and the way that you talk about atheism in that way,
3822000	3826000	the way that you approach it doesn't feel hateful to me.
3826000	3831000	Well, that's good, because I've certainly been accused of the opposite.
3831000	3833000	I always feel like the most attractive thing about atheism
3833000	3838000	is the same reason why I don't bother quite to go all the way over to it,
3838000	3840000	which is it's the edge of the pool.
3840000	3842000	It is the real thing that is there to hold you up
3842000	3844000	and keep you from drowning, and in the meantime, I'm like,
3844000	3846000	I'm going to try to talk about it.
3846000	3848000	I like the holidays.
3848000	3854000	It's...
3854000	3857000	People who try to convince you to be atheists are wrong.
3857000	3860000	You either are or you aren't, and you should be left alone to do...
3860000	3862000	And everybody should be left alone
3862000	3866000	as long as you don't impinge on their day-to-day,
3866000	3869000	week-to-week, year-to-year life, or your children,
3869000	3873000	and that's why, like you were saying,
3873000	3876000	I really can't stand those proselytizing atheists,
3876000	3881000	and it's annoying, it's off-putting, and you are a yarn.
3881000	3885000	It's not like a big struggle, and if it is, God bless you on your...
3885000	3889000	Oh, ironic. On your journey.
3889000	3897000	But I guess the credo of the atheist should just be simply to yourself,
3897000	3902000	I don't need a book to tell me the right way to treat people.
3903000	3905000	What happens to your skin?
3905000	3910000	When you say you're atheist to the world, what happens?
3910000	3914000	Well, I'm dark-skinned, I'm Jew, so...
3914000	3920000	I used to be white, then I became super atheist.
3920000	3922000	And then this happened.
3922000	3926000	I will say, I mean, I won't say that I'm atheist or not,
3926000	3931000	because people would have a weird reaction to it,
3931000	3936000	and I want to be careful, but for me, if you do a thought experiment,
3936000	3940000	and you're like, there's no religion, it's atheism,
3940000	3945000	and then you look at the world from a purely atheist perspective,
3945000	3949000	that is the world that makes the most sense to me.
3949000	3953000	Like, just scientifically, from the things we understand and know,
3953000	3957000	that's the version that seems to make the most sense.
3957000	3959000	Except that the human eye is so complicated.
3960000	3961000	Hitting.
3964000	3970000	You're saying that a windstorm could come through an airplane...
3970000	3971000	What is the thing?
3971000	3972000	Airport?
3972000	3973000	No, it's a...
3973000	3976000	What's the anti-atheist thing?
3976000	3977000	It's a...
3977000	3979000	Yeah, that...
3979000	3985000	Yeah, there's like a scattered graveyard of airport parts in this story,
3985000	3987000	and then the idea that the wind would come,
3987000	3989000	and then it would just magically create this here.
3989000	3993000	Well, they use logic to try to prove their religion,
3993000	3997000	and they go like, how come when I open peanut butter, there's no ants in it?
3997000	3998000	Right.
3998000	3999000	What?
3999000	4000000	Who told you that?
4000000	4003000	Well, the plane thing doesn't make sense, because it's evolution,
4003000	4007000	so there were millions of other planes that didn't get made,
4007000	4010000	and they're just like, weighing on a seat, you know?
4010000	4011000	You can tell us that.
4011000	4013000	We want you to know you don't have to.
4013000	4014000	I'm marveling at the...
4014000	4020000	Those guys are like, look, doesn't it seem like the banana was meant to fit in a hand?
4020000	4023000	Atheist wears nightmare.
4023000	4025000	They have videos like that.
4025000	4028000	And there's a guy that takes you through the banana.
4028000	4033000	The added irony, by the way, forget the fact that monkeys came after bananas!
4033000	4041000	But just the added irony that the banana he's holding is the result of a post-human genetic experiment.
4041000	4045000	Like, there's no banana that ever looked like that before we invented fucking DNA manipulation.
4045000	4046000	Right.
4046000	4048000	He's like, look, it's a whole fruit that's a handle.
4048000	4050000	That means there's a God.
4050000	4054000	And the extra irony is he keeps demonstrating how to eat the banana and how natural it is,
4054000	4055000	so he's just like, it looks so...
4055000	4058000	I'm sure it's his nightmare how gay he looks.
4058000	4060000	He's got this spray-on tan, and he's like, I need you to go like this.
4060000	4061000	Isn't this great?
4061000	4062000	Isn't this great?
4062000	4064000	And the guy next to him is like, yeah, that's great.
4064000	4065000	Ha!
4065000	4067000	Those atheists are really crying right now.
4067000	4071000	Anything shaped like this is God's answer.
4071000	4073000	Put it in your mouth.
4073000	4075000	Put it in your mouth.
4075000	4083000	My favorite thing is when people get upset when they get insulted at the notion of evolution
4083000	4087000	when they're like, they're trying to say that we came from monkeys.
4087000	4088000	We didn't come...
4088000	4092000	They're not saying, like, your dad fucked a monkey.
4092000	4096000	We're like, yeah, how come if you stay at the zoo long enough, you don't see a person all of a sudden going,
4096000	4097000	let me out of here.
4097000	4098000	Yeah.
4098000	4100000	Why doesn't that ever happen?
4100000	4103000	We've had zoos for 700 years.
4103000	4107000	You know, seriously, watch Planet of the Apes backwards.
4107000	4109000	That'll explain everything.
4109000	4110000	There was this...
4110000	4113000	I read that this school had this creation science fair,
4113000	4117000	and the person who came in the first place put, like, glass jar, put sand and rocks inside it and sealed it,
4117000	4121000	and a couple weeks later, nothing had evolved, so evolution disproved.
4121000	4124000	But I thought it'd be so awesome if they pulled it out,
4124000	4126000	and there's, like, a little giraffe in there.
4126000	4128000	Oh, fuck.
4128000	4132000	Well, the crazy thing is that the scientific version of what we're talking about
4132000	4136000	almost disturbing, like, Oparin's hypothesis was, like,
4136000	4143000	didn't Oparin, like, take a tank full of, like, primordial kind of, like,
4143000	4149000	shit that would exist in the beginning and, like, put electric currents through it
4149000	4156000	to simulate, like, lightning, and simulated, like, the real jar of peanut butter
4156000	4161000	that would have a giraffe in it, and the actual scientific giraffe did, like, come out of nowhere.
4161000	4163000	Wait, is this the guy from the 20s, though?
4163000	4164000	Yeah, I think...
4164000	4165000	Wait, who's this?
4165000	4166000	He was discredited, though.
4166000	4167000	Oh, it was him?
4167000	4168000	Because they couldn't find...
4168000	4171000	He lost all his...
4171000	4174000	Or a place caught on fire.
4174000	4175000	One of his labs or something.
4175000	4176000	That was the frog guy.
4176000	4177000	I think I know your...
4177000	4178000	That's what I'm thinking of.
4178000	4179000	Yeah, I wonder if that's the same guy.
4179000	4182000	I really thought you said Oparin's hypothesis.
4182000	4185000	Welcome to my new science podcast.
4185000	4189000	We should look this up later.
4189000	4193000	If you're joining us, you're on a device that gives you more information than we have.
4193000	4196000	Well, we're just going to talk about it.
4196000	4197000	But, yeah, I thought...
4197000	4200000	Yeah, I remember learning in high school, Oparin's hypothesis is locked in my head.
4200000	4203000	It's like, holy shit, there's a certain kind of, like, amount of shit.
4203000	4204000	It wasn't, like...
4204000	4205000	It wasn't like a giraffe.
4205000	4207000	It wasn't even a cell or even a strand of RNA.
4207000	4212000	But it was, like, an amino acid or a protein or something, like, spontaneously assembled itself.
4212000	4215000	So it was, like, non-living to living is basically what you're saying?
4215000	4222000	No, not non-living to living, but non-living to building block of future living kind of stuff.
4222000	4223000	Sure, sure, sure.
4223000	4229000	But as David says, you should probably check in if the last science fact you knew is from high school
4229000	4230000	and you're 42 years old.
4230000	4231000	That should probably...
4231000	4232000	It's a lot.
4232000	4236000	There's a different number of planets in my solar system since when I went to high school.
4236000	4241000	So, David, I know you graciously got off a plane and came over here, so we don't want to keep you.
4241000	4242000	But is there any...
4242000	4243000	Are there any...
4243000	4244000	I don't know.
4244000	4249000	Like, while you have the attention of hundreds and hundreds of people that love you,
4249000	4254000	anything else you need to plug or say, plants in their heads?
4254000	4260000	I would not debase myself after this heady intellectual discussion.
4261000	4263000	I thought it was really nice.
4263000	4266000	I hope you had a good enough time that you'd like to come back at some point.
4266000	4267000	Yeah, absolutely.
4267000	4268000	It makes people here really...
4268000	4269000	I have.
4269000	4270000	All right.
4270000	4271000	My pleasure.
4271000	4272000	David Cross, ladies and gentlemen.
4285000	4286000	Dan.
4286000	4288000	I sat right next to him like a weirdo.
4288000	4289000	I miss him.
4289000	4291000	Remember when David was here?
4291000	4292000	Yeah, yeah.
4292000	4293000	That was fun.
4293000	4294000	Yeah.
4294000	4295000	Are you taking a dig at me?
4295000	4296000	No.
4296000	4297000	Oh.
4297000	4298000	Wait, how am I taking a dig at you?
4298000	4301000	Because he stepped off the stage and you immediately started missing him.
4301000	4303000	I'm the only one left.
4303000	4304000	No.
4304000	4306000	Not a dig.
4306000	4309000	Now suddenly people understood, now they think it's a dig.
4309000	4310000	It was never a dig.
4310000	4313000	No, no, what they started understanding is how fucked up I am.
4313000	4314000	Yes.
4314000	4317000	They went, whoa, that's a pretzel braid.
4318000	4320000	I always think there's a video with that banana thing.
4320000	4321000	That's amazing.
4321000	4322000	Yes, it's amazing.
4322000	4325000	Whenever people are like, well, this is proof of a benevolent God.
4325000	4328000	I'm always like, yeah, but there's also fucking tigers around.
4328000	4329000	You know?
4329000	4335000	Those people fascinate me the most because it's like, well, they have the easiest move
4335000	4337000	in the magic deck, which is faith.
4337000	4338000	I don't care.
4338000	4340000	And they don't use it.
4340000	4343000	They choose the logic path to be a Christian.
4343000	4344000	What are you doing?
4344000	4347000	Why are you playing basketball in skis?
4347000	4352000	My dad, who I said earlier, is a Baptist minister.
4352000	4356000	After sermons, sometimes I would see people come up to him the same way that someone
4356000	4360000	would come up to, come on, Aaron.
4360000	4362000	Who's one person who is in Star Trek?
4362000	4365000	God damn it, Aaron, who is one actor.
4365000	4366000	Whoopi Goldberg.
4366000	4367000	Cradle robber.
4367000	4378000	Wait, why didn't you want to say a Star Trek person?
4378000	4385000	Because it's analogous to people who come up to actors in Star Trek and say, hey, I
4385000	4386000	was just thinking about it.
4386000	4389000	And this could actually happen because I did the math.
4389000	4392000	And you guys got to this planet at this certain speed.
4392000	4396000	And the same way to my dad after sermons, a guy would be like, yeah, I took all the
4396000	4398000	bees out of Genesis.
4398000	4400000	And I added them together.
4400000	4406000	And that number is the same number of days that Noah had lunch with Sarah.
4406000	4410000	And so this stuff is totally real.
4410000	4412000	And my dad would be like, all right.
4412000	4414000	Well, yeah, you can find patterns wherever.
4414000	4415000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4415000	4416000	That's what I love about your dad.
4416000	4420000	I don't know if it's one of the things when I was like, OK, this is my father-in-law.
4420000	4424000	I just have to marry his daughter still.
4424000	4430000	When you told me about how he was like, he's a Navy chaplain, but like one of his Navy
4430000	4433000	crewmen seamen?
4433000	4434000	Crewmen seamen?
4434000	4439000	I don't want to call someone a seamen unless I absolutely know that I'm supposed to.
4439000	4443000	They call him the Jizz Boys.
4443000	4445000	One of his Jizz Boys.
4445000	4446000	One of his Jizz Boys.
4446000	4447000	That's what my dad said.
4447000	4452000	One of the guys within his flock was a Scientologist.
4452000	4456000	And so he went out and bought Scientology books.
4456000	4459000	He's a Baptist preacher.
4459000	4461000	He's fine with gay marriage.
4461000	4465000	He has to go up against his own congregations sometimes and the powers that be above him.
4465000	4471000	But in addition to that, he knows that his role is to like, these are soldiers,
4471000	4474000	and they're in a time of crisis no matter what.
4474000	4481000	And my job is to be there for any kind of emergency I need spiritually.
4481000	4487000	And he read Scientology books so that in a pinch, if somebody, the one Scientologist
4487000	4495000	aboard, got his pinky stuck in a cannon door, he'd be like, oh, Mixle Plix, please help me.
4495000	4498000	And your dad would be like, I know what he means.
4498000	4502000	Mixle Plix, he dookies doo.
4502000	4505000	Yeah, my dad also carries a wand.
4505000	4513000	Some of you Scientologists in the audience may have been offended by my depiction of your religion.
4513000	4517000	OK, so well, yeah, I mean, we're on a bullet train here.
4517000	4518000	Should we bring out?
4518000	4520000	Yeah, we got to bring out the boys.
4520000	4521000	Let's bring out the boys.
4521000	4524000	Let's bring out the Jizz Boys.
4524000	4526000	The Jizz Boys.
4527000	4530000	We're going to bring out Game Master Spencer Crittenden.
4541000	4544000	And he was with us last time when we were creating our characters,
4544000	4545000	and he's still here.
4545000	4546000	I was assuming he's coming up.
4546000	4547000	Demorj Brown.
4551000	4553000	Downtown Demorj Brown, we call him.
4557000	4561000	Because there's another Demorj Brown who does like comedy sketches and stuff.
4561000	4565000	So Downtown Demorj Brown is the VJ version.
4565000	4568000	Doing references from 1982.
4568000	4575000	You will get them if you go home and ask your parents for the VCR and their floorboards.
4575000	4580000	When I was a kid, there was a kid named Wesley Brown who was bigger than I was
4580000	4583000	and had a bald head and glasses.
4583000	4588000	And he used to say, Downtown Demorj Brown, every time I came in the room.
4588000	4590000	That sounds like an oracle.
4590000	4592000	You liked that, though, right?
4592000	4593000	That sounds nice.
4593000	4594000	He did that to everybody.
4594000	4597000	He was like a basketball announcer, sort of.
4597000	4603000	Well, OK, I guess that belies the illusion.
4604000	4607000	Was it Downtown Julie Brown missing for a while?
4607000	4611000	Right, but they found her in the least likely of places.
4611000	4612000	Yeah, uptown.
4618000	4621000	It's the story everyone's talking about.
4621000	4625000	A celebrity disappearance with a nomenclature old twist.
4630000	4632000	Yes, Downtown Julie Brown.
4632000	4634000	I wonder how that works.
4634000	4638000	Does anyone in this room remember Julie Brown, the non-Downtown Julie Brown?
4638000	4641000	She just did a comedy show in Los Felos a couple of weeks ago.
4641000	4642000	I always liked her a lot.
4642000	4647000	And the character of Julie Brown, which I was very confused by because I thought that was her.
4647000	4651000	But she said, I'm doing a show in the character of Julie Brown.
4651000	4654000	Didn't she write Earth Girls Are Easy or was she just in it?
4654000	4655000	I don't know.
4655000	4661000	She was very creatively active back before there was an Internet to be kind of fringy but also funny.
4662000	4664000	She was a hero to some people.
4664000	4670000	She'd have her on the show, talk to her about looking at Jeff Goldblum's like,
4670000	4672000	do you ever see Earth Girls Are Easy?
4672000	4674000	I've seen the cover of the tape.
4674000	4676000	I watched it last Christmas.
4676000	4679000	Was Whoopi Goldberg in it? Because she's the only...
4679000	4682000	I know. Someone just said no. Thank you.
4683000	4686000	Can you follow me around in my life so I can pick up a shoe and I'd be like,
4686000	4689000	lunch? And you'd be like, no, that's not lunch, Aaron.
4690000	4692000	Damon Wayans is in it, though, right?
4692000	4694000	Isn't Damon Wayans in it?
4694000	4699000	Yes, Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey and Jeff Goldblum are type of aliens that are like hairy,
4699000	4703000	furry alien people that descend on the valley.
4703000	4708000	And oh, my God, the only earthlings that they meet are like these valley girls,
4708000	4709000	which was like a thing.
4709000	4713000	And then they shave them and they're like, oh, my God, you're totally hot underneath all their fur.
4713000	4715000	What do they shave on them?
4715000	4716000	Their bodies.
4716000	4718000	They have red and yellow and blue fur.
4718000	4719000	What do they shave the girls?
4719000	4720000	No, no, no.
4720000	4721000	Oh, God, no.
4721000	4723000	The girls don't have fur all over them.
4723000	4727000	They're aliens do and they shave them and they look like Jim Carrey's fur.
4727000	4728000	I mean, the girls do have fur all over them,
4728000	4730000	but they've been conditioned by society to take care of that
4730000	4732000	before it becomes the alien's problem.
4733000	4736000	When they're fat, like Jim Carrey's green, they're different colors.
4736000	4741000	Yeah, they're like different teletubbies, almost, like these live bodies.
4741000	4743000	It's an interesting movie.
4743000	4747000	In a world where, yeah, like, yeah, I don't know, kids should watch it.
4748000	4755000	Zardoz, Hudson Hawk, watch movies that kind of, you know.
4755000	4759000	Is the title ironic, Earth Girls Not Actually Easy?
4759000	4760000	I don't know.
4760000	4762000	They were, in that movie, they were easy.
4762000	4763000	Huh.
4763000	4768000	I think the title obviously just bridges, at the time, an ironic coupling,
4768000	4769000	which is sci-fi with sexuality.
4769000	4771000	Sounds like a movie that was written after somebody said,
4771000	4774000	we should have a movie called Earth Girls Are Easy.
4774000	4778000	I think it might have been based on a Julie Brown novelty song, frankly.
4778000	4781000	I don't know if she made that, because she was, yeah, look it up.
4781000	4782000	Google it.
4782000	4783000	Again, thank you.
4783000	4785000	Thank you for coming to pop culture.
4785000	4787000	We'll look it up later.
4787000	4789000	Spencer is here.
4789000	4790000	Yeah, he is.
4790000	4792000	Here he is.
4792000	4794000	Yay.
4794000	4795000	Thanks, audience.
4795000	4797000	I needed that.
4797000	4799000	So I got a weird anecdote I got to share.
4799000	4803000	Okay, so I hang out with my friend Matt Landsman.
4803000	4807000	He's a friend of mine, and I've had the convention of when I enter the room,
4807000	4810000	I have a wireless Jambox speaker.
4810000	4818000	When I enter the room, I play the John Cena theme song right as I open the door.
4818000	4820000	I hope you guys know the theme song.
4820000	4823000	Anyway, the other night, I was at my friend Matt's house,
4823000	4829000	and his roommate was just coming home, and I didn't have the song quite queued up,
4829000	4831000	and we all realized what had to happen.
4831000	4834000	I had to get the song queued up before he got in the house,
4834000	4836000	and no one knew how that was going to happen.
4836000	4837000	So I was like, lock the door.
4837000	4839000	And my friend runs and does the chain.
4839000	4842000	You know, the chain where you, yeah, locks the door like that,
4842000	4844000	and I'm queuing up the song.
4844000	4845000	I got it.
4845000	4846000	It starts playing.
4846000	4848000	You know, it takes about six seconds to really kick in,
4848000	4851000	and like as, right as the guy is going up,
4851000	4853000	bah, scabagoo!
4853000	4859000	Part, like, the roommate literally kicks in the door
4859000	4864000	and enters the room right as John Cena is like, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
4864000	4870000	It was amazing and horrifying.
4870000	4874000	That's the culmination of that whole, you can never play that song now.
4874000	4876000	I know, it's ruined now.
4876000	4879000	You have to destroy property to play the song.
4879000	4882000	That story requires familiarity with that song for sure.
4882000	4884000	Yeah, I kind of wanted to walk on.
4884000	4886000	Because otherwise it's just a story that your friend came home
4886000	4888000	and kicked in the door.
4888000	4889000	Yeah, you need to know the song,
4889000	4893000	but I feel confident that most everyone has heard that song before.
4893000	4895000	So, very confident.
4895000	4898000	I don't know the song, but I really got the story.
4898000	4900000	I was there with you.
4900000	4901000	I was.
4901000	4902000	You got to listen to the song, man.
4902000	4909000	John Cena theme song on Google, third video result down.
4909000	4910000	I know how to get it.
4910000	4914000	If I type J-O into Google, it's just there.
4914000	4916000	It says John Cena theme song.
4917000	4919000	I think that's just you, Spencer.
4919000	4920000	Oh, no, I know.
4920000	4921000	That's what I'm saying.
4921000	4922000	I do that so often.
4922000	4924000	It's two letters for me.
4924000	4928000	I have to tell this story now because I'll never remember it
4928000	4929000	and I just remembered it.
4929000	4935000	I had a girl over to my apartment back in my horrible,
4935000	4938000	flawed bachelor days.
4938000	4941000	Very small, two-bedroom apartment in Las Feliz.
4941000	4945000	For some reason, we had been on a couple dates
4945000	4947000	and I guess this is...
4947000	4949000	You're going to find out that I'm a bad third date,
4949000	4951000	but we were going to watch 2001.
4955000	4958000	Whatever we ate or whatever was happening to me,
4958000	4963000	this is a small apartment and the bathroom is right next to the living room
4963000	4967000	and the door is thin and it was like...
4967000	4969000	I hadn't made those calculations.
4969000	4971000	It was like, I like this girl.
4971000	4972000	We're watching 2001.
4972000	4974000	Oh, gurgle, gurgle.
4974000	4976000	I got to go do something that I can tell already
4976000	4981000	is going to have acoustic attributes to it.
4981000	4984000	So I go in the bathroom and I swear to God,
4984000	4987000	even though it seems like a really dumb sitcom pitch
4987000	4990000	or like not even because...
4990000	4993000	But I'm listening to her watching 2001
4993000	4995000	because I didn't want to pause it because I didn't want silence
4995000	4997000	while I did this.
4997000	4998000	So I'm listening to it.
4998000	5001000	And you can't turn the volume up because then she knows.
5001000	5009000	So my only choice is I'm waiting for the fake Zarathustra to crescendo.
5009000	5011000	That's my plan.
5015000	5017000	And I know it sounds fake.
5017000	5021000	It sounds like I'm a Spalding Grey and I'm like...
5021000	5024000	It does not sound like you're Spalding Grey.
5024000	5027000	I mean like a Spalding Grey.
5027000	5029000	No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you...
5029000	5032000	Guys, can you give us a minute?
5032000	5034000	Baby, baby, no, you're a Spalding Grey.
5034000	5035000	You're a Spalding Grey.
5035000	5037000	No, you're going to die on the stage. Don't worry.
5037000	5039000	Leave it alone. You're good.
5039000	5040000	I'm going to spend my life being a joke.
5040000	5041000	I'm going to be a joke with you too?
5041000	5043000	I don't know.
5043000	5047000	Anyways, we're back and so later...
5047000	5053000	Mr. Recipe is going to come out and show you a strudel that will...
5053000	5055000	Shit your pants off.
5055000	5069000	So I was on the toilet trying to wait for this calm, serene, epic investigation of the human condition
5069000	5074000	to reach its point in the overture when the timpani drums covered my fucking...
5074000	5080000	And it worked the exact opposite because I was like prepping it and then I framed it
5080000	5084000	and I swear what happened was just like drums going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
5084000	5088000	It was like the song was like I was doing it with the song.
5088000	5091000	It was framed by it.
5091000	5096000	And after a point it was just like, just get it out, stop it.
5096000	5098000	Because everything you're doing to try to...
5098000	5099000	You're Daffy Duck now.
5099000	5101000	Everything you do is like making you not Bugs Bunny.
5101000	5103000	Just flush it and just finish it.
5103000	5106000	Just see how this goes.
5106000	5113000	And I came out and I went like, sorry about that.
5113000	5123000	And she was like, about what?
5123000	5128000	But also the look on her face was kind of like, now that I look back on it, I'm like,
5128000	5129000	she was saying about what?
5129000	5133000	As if to say, don't talk about your shit after making me listen to it.
5133000	5135000	Well, that's her problem.
5135000	5137000	Well, I don't know.
5137000	5138000	She was like, about what?
5138000	5141000	And then I was like, well, about the noisy shit I took.
5142000	5144000	And she's like, I didn't hear it.
5144000	5145000	She's like, stop, stop.
5145000	5149000	Third date, third date.
5149000	5150000	All right, so...
5150000	5156000	Word for word, Spalding Grey's final performance.
5156000	5166000	I got to look up Spalding Grey.
5166000	5172000	I feel weird and also David, my whole thing was in fealty to David.
5172000	5175000	I wanted to let him go because I didn't want to hold him up.
5175000	5177000	But he went backstage and he's watching the show.
5177000	5180000	And now I feel like, bring him back out.
5180000	5194000	Bring him back out.
5195000	5200000	We'll understand if you leave very quickly after your encore.
5206000	5211000	I have this awkward thing where I'm not a self loathing nerd,
5211000	5214000	but I've had enough guests where toward the end of the show I've had to explain to them,
5214000	5217000	we're about to do something you might not understand.
5217000	5221000	Because around this hour we go into a role playing game.
5221000	5223000	And we're starting a new one tonight.
5223000	5230000	And I never know, first of all, how prepared Spencer is to throw new random people into something.
5230000	5233000	And I also never know how the people feel about it.
5233000	5235000	Well, we're not doing the adventure today, right?
5235000	5236000	We're just introducing the character.
5236000	5240000	Well, you know, I thought that we told the audience we'd play.
5240000	5242000	So there's...
5242000	5243000	No one knows Shadowrun.
5243000	5247000	There's this thing in Shadowrun that's like a quick start rules guide that comes with it.
5247000	5248000	Shadowrun?
5248000	5249000	Yeah.
5252000	5253000	The guy's right here.
5253000	5261000	Dan, your instinct was correct.
5261000	5264000	David, have you ever played any role playing games?
5264000	5269000	Like that kind of thing? No.
5269000	5276000	It's kind of like if Lord of the Rings was like, oh fuck.
5276000	5279000	Have you ever heard the word Shadowrun before?
5279000	5280000	No.
5280000	5282000	Shadowrun.
5282000	5290000	It was a late 70s song by Billy Joe and the Fish.
5290000	5293000	Baby, make my Shadowrun.
5297000	5301000	Can you go on and explain what that would mean?
5301000	5304000	Like if someone was to make your Shadowrun?
5304000	5311000	It's your spirit, your soul, the idea of who and what you are, what you stand for, what you believe.
5311000	5317000	But it's inside you, but then you're going to the forest for this whole other reason.
5317000	5318000	There's a whole backstory.
5318000	5324000	And you're going to the edge of the forest, and then you get scared, but not...
5324000	5330000	It's a switch because you ate a funny cake.
5331000	5335000	So the body would normally be scared, but your essence would not be scared.
5335000	5337000	It would stand up and fight.
5337000	5346000	But in this switcheroo, because the warlock of Glenbore falls,
5346000	5348000	and you've already gone through the Valley of Tears.
5348000	5350000	So now you're at the forest.
5350000	5354000	So your essence gets scared, and then it runs through.
5354000	5359000	And Shadow is just a shortcut for everything.
5359000	5365000	I thought it was like, you make me want to be a better person, you make the dark parts of me flee.
5365000	5367000	I mean, you know, it's interesting.
5367000	5370000	I had your explanation to think about mine.
5375000	5379000	I thought it meant that in a relationship you lose yourself, so you make your Shadowrun.
5379000	5383000	You don't see yourself anymore. You're absorbed.
5383000	5387000	Oh, you lose the self in a way that's selfless.
5388000	5390000	Wait, what do you mean? I didn't get that.
5390000	5393000	Shadowrun!
5394000	5398000	Well, you see your Shadow, you see yourself, you see your reflection of yourself.
5398000	5400000	You make my Shadowrun.
5400000	5404000	I like what you are so much, and I am at such a deficit as a person, that you make my Shadowrun.
5404000	5407000	I'm just you now. I am going to be absorbed.
5407000	5414000	Oh, I thought it's a more positive thing in that you're not obsessed with yourself in the way you were before.
5414000	5416000	Now there's someone else that you care for.
5416000	5420000	And so you're not just self-reflexive all the time.
5420000	5422000	No, wait a second.
5422000	5424000	That's a better way to look at it.
5424000	5428000	I thought, I mean, obviously we've been joking around.
5430000	5439000	I thought it's from 12 o'clock in the afternoon until just about 5 o'clock during the spring and fall.
5440000	5445000	But time goes quicker, so your Shadow actually elongates.
5445000	5447000	Oh, you make my life go...
5447000	5451000	Time goes by like a whole night with you. You make my Shadowrun.
5451000	5454000	Oh, that's beautiful. That's beautiful.
5454000	5463000	I just saw an older guy who looked a lot like my dad and wore blue jeans and would walk along the roadside at 1 o'clock in the morning singing to himself.
5463000	5465000	That one's wrong. That one's wrong.
5466000	5469000	The exception that proves the rule.
5469000	5471000	Classic death.
5471000	5480000	I think what this song has going for it is that sun rhymes with run and the sun makes a Shadow go away.
5480000	5484000	I like the sundial theory, which is what I'm calling David's.
5484000	5487000	I think the sun makes the Shadow show up.
5487000	5489000	No, no, no.
5489000	5493000	At 12 noon, there's no shadow because the sun is...
5494000	5504000	I tried to block myself from everything in your sun, but in the end, baby, you make my Shadow run.
5504000	5509000	Like, you move through the sky.
5509000	5518000	No matter how hard I try, you move through the sky and make my darkness come undone.
5518000	5520000	You make my Shadow run.
5520000	5524000	From 9 to 5, I got a plier in my hand.
5524000	5526000	What is that job, Dan?
5526000	5528000	That's just blue collar flavor.
5528000	5538000	A little fun fact is he recorded that with over 32 different tools.
5538000	5543000	He makes a different one.
5543000	5545000	He could sell it to different people.
5545000	5547000	Like, Huey Lewis is a song where he's like, Milwaukee!
5547000	5549000	Like, yeah.
5549000	5551000	The heart of rock and roll.
5551000	5553000	Seattle!
5553000	5555000	Well, honey, that's our city.
5555000	5557000	I didn't even know we were fans of this guy.
5557000	5559000	How did he do that?
5559000	5561000	Was he in our radio?
5561000	5563000	He in our radio.
5563000	5569000	I have that Shadow run song stuck in my head now, for real.
5569000	5582000	The time I block your light bulb when the day is done, baby, you make my Shadow run.
5582000	5586000	My Shadow run.
5586000	5590000	That's a duet from the TV movie.
5590000	5594000	But in the morning, the light comes again.
5594000	5599000	All right.
5599000	5605000	So you do know what Shadow run is.
5605000	5612000	I was just going to say, that's going to make everything a lot easier now that we are all on the same page.
5612000	5616000	I was so hoping you were just stewing there.
5616000	5619000	You were like, this is a serious thing and you're about to snap.
5619000	5624000	That is not what Shadow run is, guys.
5624000	5629000	Somebody worked hard on this.
5629000	5633000	I mean, not even in a joke.
5633000	5639000	In all seriousness, I've encountered like seven of those kinds of Shadow run enthusiasts already,
5639000	5641000	and I'm getting kind of sick of that.
5641000	5643000	People who are like, too into it?
5643000	5645000	Yeah, I'm going to lean in that other direction.
5645000	5650000	I mean, when you're talking about fairies and shit, you can't take yourself seriously.
5650000	5655000	That's what the Irish do.
5655000	5659000	Look what it got them.
5659000	5665000	That brings the whole theme into it, both gay rights and religious transparency.
5665000	5666000	It's like, well, don't cry.
5666000	5668000	I'm not Archie Bunker.
5668000	5674000	I'm just saying, like, yeah, if you take anything too seriously, you lose your Shadow.
5674000	5681000	I thought when he like Irish fairies, you were trying to connect those two.
5681000	5682000	Yeah.
5682000	5688000	Like what if the Irish believed in fairies so much that when you flew Aer Lingus,
5688000	5691000	if an Irish guy got on the plane, he was like, I'm sorry.
5691000	5696000	That person's got salt on their shoe.
5696000	5699000	We wouldn't tolerate it from them.
5699000	5701000	Aer Lingus sounds really sexual.
5701000	5702000	It does.
5702000	5703000	Yeah.
5703000	5704000	Yeah.
5704000	5707000	The joy of it.
5707000	5710000	But there's no fairies in Shadowrun world, right?
5710000	5711000	It's like a cyberpunk thing.
5711000	5713000	No, I mean, there's orcs and elves and shit.
5713000	5715000	I don't think there's fairies necessarily.
5715000	5716000	Yeah, come on, man.
5716000	5718000	There are no fairies.
5718000	5720000	But it's like technology phase.
5720000	5725000	I did read that if elves contract one of those viruses, they could turn into a banshee,
5725000	5727000	and I know that a banshee is a fairy.
5727000	5729000	Yep.
5729000	5730000	Oh, man.
5730000	5731000	Shit.
5731000	5733000	Yeah, you're marveling.
5733000	5735000	I will take that sound at face value.
5735000	5738000	You are marveling at me.
5738000	5742000	As people don't laugh when evil, Knievel makes a landing.
5742000	5745000	I know that sound was, you were breathless.
5745000	5750000	Shadowrun is like D&D if trolls had pink mohawks and spray paint.
5750000	5751000	And iPads.
5751000	5752000	Spray paint.
5752000	5755000	The hallmark of technology.
5755000	5761000	But yes.
5761000	5763000	That's true, though.
5763000	5767000	Yeah, aliens are going to come and be like, these guys, oh, they have spray paint cannons.
5767000	5769000	Leave them alone.
5769000	5778000	Your paint ain't confined to just a can and a brush it's in the air.
5778000	5779000	What?
5779000	5783000	Air doesn't rhyme with Shadowrun.
5783000	5788000	It's not going to, no matter how long we wait.
5788000	5790000	So what is Shadowrun?
5790000	5792000	Everyone's familiar with Shadowrun.
5792000	5795000	No, I don't think anyone's familiar with it.
5795000	5802000	It's a role-playing game in which collectively we tell a story together where these guys play as characters.
5802000	5804000	I know that's your justification for playing it.
5804000	5806000	But what is?
5806000	5810000	Oh, no.
5810000	5814000	That one cut a little deep.
5814000	5819000	We don't get ready to rumble.
5819000	5828000	But it's like Dungeons and Dragons where it's a story, but the context is different.
5828000	5830000	But it's a different world.
5830000	5832000	It's not as sorcery.
5832000	5834000	It's more technology and magic.
5834000	5835000	And the future.
5835000	5837000	Laser is in spray paint.
5837000	5839000	It's like a dystopian Earth.
5839000	5849000	Literally, I'm not trying to be funny, but where you'd have a spell that would do a certain thing, now you have technology that does a certain thing.
5849000	5850000	Well, it's actually both.
5850000	5858000	So you got your guys who cast magic, but then you also have guys who just have guns and robot parts that hate people with magic.
5858000	5860000	David!
5860000	5861000	David!
5861000	5862000	David!
5862000	5865000	You said you weren't...
5865000	5868000	Too much.
5868000	5869000	And hacking.
5869000	5870000	It's a lot to digest.
5870000	5872000	I think he's got a good grasp on it.
5872000	5874000	But I think I get it.
5874000	5886000	It's like William Gibson's future or Blade Runner, like in the midst of Blade Runner, then someone said, ah, there's elves now.
5886000	5887000	It's dystopian hobbit.
5887000	5889000	It's a mishmash.
5889000	5891000	Yeah, no, that's a good way of putting it.
5891000	5895000	It is just like Blade Runner except also magic.
5895000	5897000	Seems like lazy writing to me.
5897000	5898000	Okay.
5898000	5901000	Yeah, it's how you get around.
5901000	5902000	How are they going to be?
5902000	5905000	How they have magic so they can do whatever the fuck they want.
5905000	5907000	It's like the giant eagles and the hobbit.
5907000	5910000	Anyway, we don't have to get into it.
5910000	5911000	Are you a D&D guy?
5911000	5913000	I don't really know.
5913000	5915000	I just know it from here.
5915000	5917000	I love fantasy stuff, but do you like sci-fi stuff?
5917000	5919000	Do you like Blade Runner and shit like that?
5919000	5921000	I like Blade Runner.
5921000	5928000	Some science fiction stuff I do, but I'm not drawn to the genre like other people are.
5928000	5930000	You're only like the best examples of it probably.
5930000	5931000	Just good.
5931000	5932000	Yeah.
5932000	5933000	Good.
5933000	5934000	I'm fine with good.
5934000	5938000	There just isn't a lot of good.
5938000	5944000	And since the first edition of Shadowrun was introduced in 1987, is that right?
5944000	5945000	I think, yeah.
5945000	5951000	So it's been around for a while, but we're now in the fifth edition.
5951000	5952000	Yeah.
5952000	5959000	Meanwhile, we can't get somebody to take it on the pass at the Koran.
5959000	5964000	I should stop saying that before it becomes your catchphrase.
5964000	5965000	Yeah.
5965000	5969000	It won't be it for very long.
5969000	5972000	I'll get hebdode.
5972000	5973000	What?
5973000	5976000	I can say it.
5976000	5977000	He's right.
5977000	5978000	He's right.
5978000	5980000	He didn't make the rules.
5980000	5987000	He's just riding them across the finish line.
5987000	5988000	So, yeah.
5988000	5996000	I mean, originally we were going to present characters, you know, even if that might take
5996000	5997000	the whole time we have left.
5997000	5999000	But let's present the characters, right?
5999000	6000000	Yes.
6000000	6001000	Yeah.
6002000	6003000	So I could pass these out.
6003000	6004000	I'll do that.
6004000	6005000	Make funnies.
6005000	6006000	All right.
6006000	6007000	Let's see.
6007000	6008000	Shadow.
6008000	6013000	Do you guys, do you make the characters or the characters are part of the game?
6013000	6017000	We kind of like, we consulted with him because it's a new game with a new milieu.
6017000	6021000	So we talked last episode about the kinds of characters we'd like to play.
6021000	6027000	And so there's been a sort of interplay between Spencer doing arguably probably the hardest,
6027000	6030000	most joyless work of like rolling our characters.
6030000	6032000	Yeah, but guys like that love that shit.
6032000	6034000	I hate it.
6034000	6036000	I love it.
6036000	6040000	I really, it took me about a combined 16 hours for all of these.
6040000	6041000	It was not.
6041000	6042000	Yeah, you got something to do.
6042000	6043000	Great.
6043000	6044000	All right.
6048000	6049000	That's true, though.
6049000	6052000	I was actually at work not doing anything during those six hours.
6052000	6053000	But you love doing it.
6053000	6054000	You get joy from it, right?
6054000	6055000	This isn't work.
6055000	6059000	I mean, joy happens at some point in the equation.
6059000	6060000	Sure.
6060000	6061000	There's joy.
6061000	6063000	I mean, there was joy.
6063000	6067000	So David, what it is is there'll be like different races you can choose from, like, or.
6067000	6069000	It's a pencil, Dan.
6073000	6077000	Or like wizards or hackers or whatever it is.
6077000	6078000	So we all.
6080000	6083000	Yeah, I made, I made, you know, folders for everyone.
6083000	6085000	There's a lot of bullets in this game.
6085000	6087000	So you really need to be marking your own inventory.
6088000	6092000	I would say the thread that the pencil is attached to is really above and beyond.
6092000	6095000	Yeah, that's because you guys are going to lose them.
6095000	6097000	I feel like I'm at a bank.
6097000	6102000	I mean, I don't want to lose these things.
6102000	6104000	You're going to take them home otherwise or something.
6104000	6105000	I don't know.
6105000	6106000	No, this is.
6106000	6108000	I can't just buy pencils every day.
6110000	6111000	That's great.
6111000	6112000	So let's talk about these guys.
6112000	6113000	Yeah, let's.
6114000	6116000	So I can we start with my guy.
6116000	6117000	Yeah.
6117000	6118000	Do you know about your guy?
6118000	6120000	I actually sent you an email about him.
6120000	6121000	I don't know if you read it.
6121000	6122000	Oh, yeah.
6125000	6128000	Yeah, I read mine.
6128000	6129000	Yeah.
6130000	6131000	No.
6131000	6133000	So assume I didn't read it.
6133000	6134000	Okay.
6134000	6137000	Well, I'll just I'll just pull up this email I sent you.
6138000	6139000	All right.
6139000	6140000	What email address did you send it to?
6140000	6141000	Do not say that.
6144000	6145000	Oh, yeah.
6145000	6148000	It's a Karen reboot at AOL.com.
6155000	6156000	All right.
6156000	6157000	Well, all new gimmick.
6157000	6162000	You're the Yakov Smirnoff of I'm really pushing for a rewrite of the
6162000	6163000	Quran.
6164000	6165000	That's my stance.
6166000	6170000	So if if if you haven't read yours, let's not start with yours.
6170000	6172000	Let's start with Dan or something.
6172000	6173000	Dan or something.
6173000	6175000	And then I could I could I could do it.
6175000	6176000	I could read it.
6176000	6177000	But you know, not the first one.
6177000	6178000	Let Dan start off.
6178000	6182000	If I wait, you want me to tell tell us about your character.
6182000	6183000	Don't read your sheet.
6183000	6184000	It's about your background and stuff.
6184000	6185000	Okay.
6185000	6186000	Yeah.
6186000	6189000	Well, I mean, I just want to ask this because like my character,
6189000	6194000	it feels like he's like I don't know how much stuff like the like
6194000	6195000	the other people should know.
6195000	6198000	But do you think I should just let it all out?
6198000	6200000	Yeah, I mean, let it all out.
6200000	6202000	They're skilled professionals.
6202000	6205000	I think if anything you say that's secret, they can pretend
6205000	6206000	the secret.
6206000	6207000	Okay.
6207000	6212000	So my character was born James Gundrum,
6212000	6219000	the third in Wisconsin in 2034.
6219000	6229000	And and his dad was a prominent member of the anti meta human
6229000	6231000	hate group.
6231000	6234000	Humanities.
6234000	6235000	Humanities.
6235000	6236000	Humanists.
6236000	6237000	Populae.
6237000	6238000	What was it?
6238000	6239000	Polly.
6239000	6240000	Polly.
6240000	6242000	There's like like kind of a Ku Klux Klan of like when like
6242000	6246000	like people started turning into like elves and stuff like there
6246000	6248000	was like a human.
6248000	6251000	But the uplifting thing is that black people could be in this
6251000	6252000	group and like hate goblins.
6252000	6253000	It was great.
6253000	6258000	We'll always it's just when you think you're going to like
6258000	6261000	achieve everything, it's like the whole new way to hate
6261000	6262000	people.
6262000	6265000	So my dad, my dad was like one of the way he was like a
6265000	6268000	founding member, kind of a thug, an arsonist,
6268000	6270000	assassin within that group.
6270000	6275000	And I he taught me how to fight and how to be scrappy.
6275000	6278000	But also I was smart and I could talk so they thought let's
6278000	6281000	send him to the Academy to be a lone star officer.
6281000	6284000	Lone star is like sort of a police force that services a
6284000	6286000	lot of the city states in the future.
6286000	6289000	And like maybe he could like eventually be a politician or
6289000	6293000	something and he could make our horrible racist cause like you
6293000	6294000	know law.
6294000	6295000	Put it into legislation.
6295000	6298000	And then I went to school and I fell in love with an elf girl.
6298000	6303000	And then like I begged my dad to like reconsider his ways but he
6303000	6304000	couldn't.
6304000	6306000	And as I was attempting to flee the state with her,
6306000	6309000	she was killed under mysterious circumstances.
6309000	6313000	And I blamed my father for it and signed on with the lone star
6314000	6317000	security services under the condition that my dad would be
6317000	6320000	among those put away when I infiltrated this horrible hate
6320000	6321000	group.
6321000	6322000	And so I did all that.
6322000	6324000	And then because I needed my identity wiped because I betrayed
6324000	6327000	everybody I knew at that job, then I just became this horrible
6327000	6330000	like they just the government just used me and sent me to
6330000	6334000	every city and made me change my name every time and taught me
6334000	6335000	how to do that.
6335000	6339000	And I would just narc on like shadow runners like in every
6339000	6340000	city.
6340000	6344000	And then I found out my dad didn't actually kill my
6344000	6345000	girlfriend.
6345000	6348000	Like I think actually the cops did to make me available for
6348000	6350000	that employment opportunity.
6350000	6352000	Because you're such a good cop.
6352000	6354000	Well because they were like boy this guy is going to be amazing
6354000	6356000	if we just kill his girlfriend.
6356000	6358000	Give him the right motivation.
6358000	6362000	His family is so racist he'll think this is a fucking,
6362000	6364000	this is not a 7-10 split.
6364000	6366000	I don't know what the opposite of that is.
6366000	6368000	Remember I'm from Wisconsin.
6369000	6371000	Okay so it's all bowling analogies.
6371000	6372000	Yeah.
6375000	6376000	I like it.
6376000	6379000	So then I was betrayed by the people that owned me and like
6379000	6381000	they used me to do shitty stuff.
6381000	6383000	I was like a narc and I believed in it and now I don't believe
6383000	6384000	in it.
6384000	6386000	And so I had to escape with my life because they were going to
6386000	6387000	kill me.
6387000	6390000	And I used the most, the only identity I had that no one knew
6390000	6393000	about which was a generic identity pulled from like a
6393000	6395000	textbook in the academy.
6395000	6397000	So my name is Jim Nightblade.
6398000	6407000	A former cop trapped in the life of the crime he used to fight.
6409000	6410000	That's a pitch.
6411000	6414000	Motherfucker everything I do is a pitch.
6415000	6419000	What if this microphone had to hang out with an anti-phone?
6421000	6422000	Okay great Aaron.
6422000	6427000	I don't know why I affected an urban dialect.
6427000	6428000	Yeah I don't know.
6429000	6431000	Any anti-phone?
6433000	6435000	I found that email Spencer.
6435000	6437000	It reminds me of going into my spam.
6437000	6438000	But I have.
6440000	6442000	But I have it and I can read it but you guys go first.
6443000	6445000	Spencer you came up with all the stuff right?
6445000	6446000	No he came up with his.
6446000	6449000	Aaron came up with her backstory and then I came up with
6449000	6452000	Demorj and Kumail's backstory because yeah.
6453000	6454000	Not nerds.
6455000	6456000	This is fascinating.
6456000	6457000	I can't.
6457000	6462000	I've never seen anything from this side where you're telling
6462000	6464000	the story and people are like oh.
6467000	6470000	Like the thing where when you said he and I found out my dad
6470000	6473000	didn't kill my girl or no when you said that my dad killed my
6473000	6476000	girlfriend there were people here who were like oh.
6477000	6480000	Yeah but you've seen that's just the power of like an audience
6480000	6483000	is grace when they're like oh we trust you and know you like
6483000	6484000	you.
6484000	6485000	That was no that was honest.
6485000	6487000	That wasn't there was nothing.
6487000	6489000	When you listen to Prairie Home Companion.
6489000	6492000	Girs and Keeler goes like and then the blueberry pie.
6493000	6494000	Paddle.
6494000	6495000	And everyone goes like.
6495000	6499000	Joe went fishing for the first time in six months.
6499000	6500000	It's called Stockholm syndrome.
6500000	6501000	Stockholm syndrome.
6504000	6507000	If I don't like my coffee this morning Munich's gonna go bad.
6508000	6509000	Okay.
6511000	6512000	Out to your Ubers.
6513000	6514000	If we're not gonna have a.
6515000	6516000	Out to your Ubers.
6517000	6521000	All right so my character is named Mercy O'Donnell and I'll
6521000	6527000	just read the short email that I sent Spencer earlier today.
6527000	6530000	It's a historical hostage event well within my right to use
6530000	6531000	that to illustrate.
6532000	6533000	Sorry.
6535000	6537000	I made a movie about it for kids.
6538000	6541000	Yeah Munich was for kids.
6543000	6545000	All right this is Mercy O'Donnell.
6546000	6551000	Former publicist for Aries macro technology and ex-wife
6551000	6553000	of its CEO Damian Knight.
6553000	6557000	Mercy O'Donnell is a madam for mega corporations and the
6557000	6558000	underground alike.
6559000	6562000	Two years ago Mercy left her husband after he beat their
6562000	6563000	teenage son to death in an argument.
6567000	6573000	When she fled Aries macro technology manipulated evidence
6573000	6576000	of the scene and the corporate court charged Mercy with a
6576000	6577000	murder.
6577000	6580000	As a madam Mercy so she's on the run.
6580000	6585000	As a madam Mercy works almost exclusively with magic users who
6585000	6589000	may or may not procure payment without quote unquote natural
6589000	6590000	sexual services rendered.
6591000	6594000	Regardless her Johns always leave happy with a name that is
6594000	6595000	always changing.
6595000	6599000	She is known by her many contacts as the eyes because I
6599000	6602000	have the best face ever is the thing that was established
6602000	6603000	before and looking at.
6605000	6606000	You're a prostitute.
6607000	6608000	No.
6610000	6614000	No I'm I'm a madam but I work mostly with magic users.
6614000	6617000	I work mostly with people who are madam mean.
6618000	6621000	What is a madam prostitute king.
6621000	6628000	Oh yeah like a prostitute king king of all the prostitutes
6628000	6629000	that's true.
6630000	6634000	The first conversation between the worst representatives of
6634000	6636000	an indigenous and an invading population.
6637000	6639000	That's that's their to talk.
6640000	6641000	How do whores work.
6643000	6645000	You need a king of whores.
6645000	6646000	Yes.
6651000	6654000	Yeah so I'm working I'm working as a madam but that's my
6654000	6658000	that's my cover but Camille and madam is somebody who's like
6658000	6660000	an agent for prostitutes.
6660000	6661000	It's like a CAA.
6661000	6663000	It's like a CAA for a prostitute.
6663000	6665000	Oh you're the CAA of prostitutes.
6665000	6668000	I thought CAA was the CAA of prostitutes.
6669000	6672000	You know in the movies when you run into a brothel and then
6672000	6678000	there's like there's all of the sad broken hearted carnival
6678000	6680000	there's a woman who's just turned 35.
6680000	6683000	Yeah I'm the madam the milf who's eight years younger than
6683000	6684000	me.
6684000	6688000	But I am more a madam as a cover.
6689000	6693000	I don't know how much I should say about my character but she's
6693000	6699000	a she she's fiercely anti male and the way that that's
6699000	6700000	shocker.
6702000	6704000	I mean you're just saying that that doesn't mean anything.
6705000	6707000	You could say shocker after almost anything.
6707000	6709000	Try it tonight kids as you go home.
6709000	6710000	It's a button.
6711000	6712000	Let's go to Arby's shocker.
6712000	6714000	She watched her husband.
6715000	6719000	She watched her husband whom she loved when they got married
6719000	6722000	kill her son and so she has like an imbalanced hatred.
6722000	6726000	But the son is also male so why is she a male hater?
6727000	6729000	Well I mean sometimes hatred doesn't make sense.
6729000	6730000	Right.
6733000	6738000	She's afraid of men and now she's wanting to protect women
6738000	6740000	but God she has this face.
6741000	6742000	She's got a great face.
6742000	6743000	She has a great face.
6743000	6744000	Right.
6744000	6745000	But it's not for you.
6746000	6747000	What do you mean?
6747000	6748000	Why is it not for me?
6748000	6749000	I don't know.
6749000	6750000	I'm spiraling.
6750000	6751000	It's not for me.
6751000	6753000	Oh if I can afford it it's for me right?
6753000	6754000	Oh no the madam doesn't.
6754000	6755000	No because I am the agent.
6756000	6757000	Sorry right.
6757000	6758000	I am the agent.
6758000	6759000	You're the agent.
6759000	6763000	But the idea is that that she is making her money by
6763000	6767000	by employing magic using prostitutes who are convincing
6767000	6769000	men that they're getting off and they're not really.
6769000	6771000	Oh okay got it got it got it.
6772000	6775000	But maybe not but maybe but not exclusively.
6777000	6781000	Being convinced that you got off is identical to getting off.
6781000	6782000	I wouldn't even have a complaint.
6782000	6783000	I'd be like thank you.
6783000	6784000	Well this is interesting.
6784000	6787000	It's different in that the girl doesn't have to put an
6787000	6789000	orc dick in her mouth.
6789000	6790000	Oh that's great for her.
6790000	6793000	That's like when the hotel says we turn your lights off
6793000	6794000	because the planet needs to be saved.
6794000	6795000	Fine for you.
6796000	6800000	I'm saying as a male customer if you told me like listen
6800000	6803000	sorry if you're I know exactly I wouldn't demand my
6803000	6804000	money back.
6804000	6806000	No I thought I got the best blowjob ever.
6806000	6811000	Well that's yeah that's a thing except except I think egos
6811000	6813000	would get in the way where guys would be like I thought
6813000	6816000	the best girl last night and someone's like you didn't
6816000	6817000	actually.
6817000	6819000	That's the perfect scene to introduce your character
6819000	6821000	like like in the movie version where like there's a guy
6821000	6823000	that's like that it's like because then you can
6823000	6826000	demonstrate how you lay down the law like to protect
6826000	6827000	these ladies.
6827000	6828000	Right.
6828000	6830000	That's what I like about the archetype of the of the of
6830000	6833000	the hooker matron who's like in a world where the government
6833000	6834000	doesn't care about humanity.
6834000	6837000	There's like a woman who's like a den mother to these lost
6837000	6838000	souls.
6838000	6841000	Yeah it's like I'm like a like a mother hen but young.
6841000	6842000	And a great face.
6842000	6844000	And like hotter than all of them.
6845000	6846000	Hotter than all of them.
6846000	6847000	Yeah.
6847000	6848000	It's like yeah.
6848000	6849000	Okay got it.
6849000	6852000	So Damour I don't know if you want to talk through but I
6852000	6855000	also have the write up that I sent you so I can read that
6855000	6856000	or you could do it.
6856000	6857000	I'll just wait.
6857000	6858000	Just to caution the audience.
6858000	6860000	Just because of the bills we have to pay.
6860000	6862000	Damour just character is basically the Noid from
6862000	6863000	Pizza Hut.
6867000	6868000	It's called branded content.
6868000	6870000	There's there's no commercials during the podcast.
6870000	6871000	No no.
6871000	6874000	But I mean Pizza Hut tastes so good.
6874000	6878000	It's just that we're okay and it's very cheap.
6878000	6879000	And it's a real thing.
6879000	6882000	I mean it's a real thing to not want cool pizzas.
6882000	6884000	I can hear you guys.
6887000	6888000	Yeah go ahead.
6890000	6893000	My character's name is Hordegard.
6894000	6895000	I'm an elf.
6896000	6897000	You're a dwarf.
6897000	6898000	I'm a dwarf.
6899000	6901000	I was just testing you.
6901000	6903000	People don't know the difference these days.
6904000	6905000	My mother was a dwarf.
6905000	6907000	My father was a dwarf.
6907000	6910000	They were both very smart and came to United States
6910000	6911000	as a science team.
6912000	6915000	I do not have the most beautiful face but I have
6915000	6916000	reasonable looks.
6918000	6921000	And for some reason a characteristic of not aging.
6924000	6927000	I was always a precognitive child.
6927000	6929000	I was born a precog.
6929000	6932000	That is to say that I can sense future events.
6933000	6934000	Oh you're like Jeff.
6934000	6936000	There is a gelatin.
6936000	6937000	Yes.
6939000	6940000	Say that again.
6940000	6941000	Jeff.
6941000	6942000	Yes.
6943000	6946000	There is a gelatin that floats in the sky that you cannot see or touch.
6947000	6950000	But I can perceive it and perceive from it and draw from it
6950000	6955000	such things as horrible accidents and crimes
6955000	6957000	and misdemeanors etc.
6960000	6964000	My mother sensing this would put me to some sort of persecution.
6964000	6966000	Built a precog bath in the basement.
6966000	6969000	My father being scared of this ran away.
6972000	6976000	She educated me in the ways of precognition though she herself was not a precog
6976000	6979000	but she was a good reader and a great teacher.
6981000	6986000	At a certain time I was urged to leave and try to find employment.
6986000	6991000	Children would laugh at me in school and I did not do very well because of this.
6991000	6993000	And so I took small jobs.
6994000	6997000	I was very old and I got a job as a busboy.
6998000	7002000	I worked with the underground restaurants and bars.
7003000	7005000	They did not know if I was a boy or a man.
7005000	7008000	I was at this age a man but they would say hey.
7009000	7010000	How old were you?
7011000	7013000	At this point I was some 26 years old.
7015000	7017000	So of course this is 2074.
7018000	7019000	Is that correct?
7019000	7020000	Sure.
7020000	7021000	Close enough.
7023000	7024000	Sure.
7024000	7030000	I worked making the most money under the table in cash with mafia and jacuzza families.
7031000	7036000	Both in the night time working in the little Italy section
7036000	7041000	and in the evening working in a little Osaka.
7043000	7046000	They had no problem spilling their information to me
7046000	7049000	so I learned a lot about the underground and how it works.
7049000	7052000	You'd be very surprised to know that the underground is really the overground.
7052000	7057000	Everything that works in front of you is moved by people you do not see.
7058000	7061000	It is not called shadow run for no reason.
7063000	7066000	You must think in the opposites and you must be neither.
7071000	7079000	Because I still have precognition I like to go outside at night
7079000	7083000	when the machines are humming and whirring and the night air is moist.
7085000	7088000	It is there that these thoughts come to me on one such night to go out
7088000	7092000	and the boss of my place in little Italy is crying.
7092000	7094000	He's smoking a cigarette and crying.
7094000	7095000	I say what is your problem?
7095000	7098000	He says you can go home.
7098000	7099000	There will be no restaurant tomorrow.
7099000	7100000	He does not explain.
7103000	7105000	I go back to my studio apartment
7105000	7110000	which is not so much an apartment because there is no floor.
7110000	7115000	There is only a tub of water in which I built a precognition tub for myself.
7118000	7122000	From this I put on opera sovage, a composition by Vangelis.
7124000	7125000	Tasty choice.
7126000	7134000	A precognition suit such as Samantha Morton might wear to an event or a gala.
7136000	7138000	You love that minority report.
7138000	7144000	I lay myself above and using the power of rear thought to suspend myself
7144000	7146000	without a net over the water.
7147000	7152000	And I saw an incident at which a man with a loaded pistol would come to him
7152000	7155000	and shoot my boss's brains out.
7156000	7160000	I waited for the vision of a woman with a wristwatch to walk by
7160000	7164000	and focused on the wristwatch, got the time of day,
7164000	7169000	knowing that it was night and there is no 2.36.
7170000	7176000	That p.m. that is at night, I sensed it was 2.36 a.m.
7176000	7179000	I went to the cross streets and waited.
7180000	7181000	What time was this at?
7181000	7183000	2.36 a.m.
7184000	7186000	What time did you get the vision?
7186000	7191000	I got the vision at 2.34 but this was the day before.
7191000	7193000	Oh, okay. So you had plenty of time to get there.
7194000	7197000	I had plenty of time to get there but no, I had to get a weapon.
7197000	7199000	I had to stuff the man with the weapon.
7200000	7203000	I got the weapon from a Yakuza boss in Osaka.
7204000	7206000	I then waited on the corner.
7206000	7209000	When I recognized the man and I saw the woman with the watch,
7209000	7210000	I raised the gun.
7210000	7211000	I shot him in the head.
7211000	7218000	I then had to go on the run deep into the annals or annals of little Italy
7218000	7221000	where I met a man who would become my father figure.
7221000	7224000	His name was Geppetto 5.0
7227000	7231000	who outfitted me with silicon and cyber devices, arms...
7234000	7237000	I'm sorry, we just heard the cold open.
7237000	7239000	That was just the...
7239000	7241000	He's just now becoming...
7241000	7242000	Oh yeah.
7242000	7243000	Go ahead, go ahead.
7243000	7248000	This is like, you know, this is the A-Team, this is the opening narration.
7248000	7250000	At what point do you flee to Brazil?
7251000	7252000	At what point do you...
7252000	7255000	A Nazi doctor, because you sound like a Nazi doctor.
7255000	7259000	At what point do you launch an award-winning career as a documentary director?
7261000	7262000	Anyway, sorry.
7262000	7265000	If I were, I would do something like this and sound different.
7265000	7268000	But anyway, I have a cyber device attachment.
7268000	7269000	Excuse me, go ahead.
7269000	7270000	Would you better 5.0 continue?
7270000	7273000	Yes, and he just gives me a number of attachments and things
7273000	7276000	and ways to better myself, including skill softs
7276000	7280000	which are programs that allow me to master certain tasks and things
7280000	7282000	through a cranial implant.
7282000	7284000	And with this, I can function for myself.
7284000	7286000	But I cannot go back into that world,
7286000	7289000	although I have all of this knowledge of how they operate.
7289000	7293000	And so, I run around in the shadows between streets and avenues
7293000	7295000	and boulevards and byways,
7297000	7300000	bartering with what I know to do best.
7300000	7304000	And that is to sneak up and stop problems, sense problems,
7304000	7306000	eliminate situations.
7307000	7311000	Sometimes with weapons, otherwise with cunning and guile.
7313000	7317000	I can occasionally step out into the light because everyone still thinks I'm a boy.
7324000	7327000	Everyone still thinks I'm a boy.
7327000	7328000	Wow.
7329000	7334000	I guess, if David wants to tell us about his character, we'll just...
7334000	7336000	My name is Chrissy Tilmick.
7339000	7344000	I am a 12-year-old LGBT transgender.
7346000	7350000	I was born with six toes on each foot,
7350000	7353000	but I now currently have three on each foot.
7357000	7360000	My father killed chickens with his mind.
7361000	7365000	We would travel from small town to small town.
7365000	7367000	Some people were enamored of that.
7367000	7369000	Some people thought he had great powers.
7369000	7372000	Some people were scared of him and frightened.
7372000	7374000	As a result, we were constantly moving.
7374000	7377000	We had a 1969 Dodge Dart.
7380000	7384000	And one day, my mother and father were very much in love.
7385000	7388000	He had sworn on their wedding day.
7389000	7391000	They loped, but it was still a wedding.
7391000	7393000	It was a day, so it was a wedding day.
7393000	7397000	That he would never use his ability to kill chickens with his mind
7397000	7399000	in any negative way towards her.
7400000	7405000	One day, we were chased out of a town, Birmingham, Alabama.
7407000	7412000	He was drinking heavily, and he started what looked like the process
7412000	7414000	of trying to kill my mom.
7414000	7416000	It was fine.
7417000	7419000	This upset me terribly.
7419000	7421000	I went running out.
7421000	7426000	My mom chased me, and she was killed by a heronado,
7426000	7428000	which is a...
7429000	7433000	As everyone knows, after the year 2021,
7434000	7438000	government Obama was still in office
7439000	7442000	and invented heronados,
7442000	7445000	which was a combination of a hurricane and a tornado.
7446000	7451000	And that was shortly before they revealed chemtrails are a real thing.
7451000	7453000	They're not just silicon.
7454000	7456000	And so my mom was killed.
7456000	7458000	It was a horrifying thing for me to witness.
7458000	7460000	As I looked behind my...
7460000	7463000	I had three shoulders, and as I looked behind the middle one,
7463000	7466000	I could see my dad running after.
7466000	7469000	And the town, the entire town of Birmingham, Alabama,
7469000	7471000	he got swallowed into the...
7471000	7475000	as they grabbed him, and they pulled him, and he was like,
7475000	7476000	Chrissy, Chrissy!
7476000	7477000	And I could see it.
7477000	7481000	He was scratching at the ground, and blood came from his nails
7481000	7485000	as they went down to stubs as he was trying to claw his way to me.
7485000	7488000	And I just knew it was fight or flight,
7488000	7491000	and I decided I'm gonna flight.
7495000	7498000	And I went to Birmingham International Airport.
7499000	7502000	And I used all my remaining...
7502000	7505000	I had some fun bucks left over from a Chuck E. Cheese,
7505000	7507000	and I turned them in.
7507000	7512000	I got on a plane to 2032,
7512000	7515000	which is the only time I could afford.
7518000	7521000	And there, when I got off the plane,
7521000	7524000	I just did that classic Chrissy Tillman thing,
7524000	7526000	where I looked down,
7526000	7530000	and the first sign I saw was for Davos,
7530000	7533000	and I went, I'm your guy.
7533000	7538000	And I got in the car and ended up at a Davos conference.
7538000	7541000	Jenna Bush was speaking,
7541000	7545000	and I managed to sneak into her hotel room
7545000	7550000	in a way that I'd only seen in hollow movies,
7550000	7553000	which is a way that people watch movies in the future.
7553000	7556000	He got that right. He got that right.
7557000	7561000	By being underneath the catering tray table,
7561000	7563000	and then I snuck out,
7563000	7567000	and I assumed Jenna Bush's personality
7567000	7572000	and her identification tron,
7572000	7576000	which she didn't even put away.
7576000	7578000	It was like it was in the closet.
7578000	7580000	The closet was open.
7580000	7582000	She just left her identification tron
7582000	7584000	and added tron.
7584000	7586000	She just added tron.
7586000	7589000	Yeah, this shit is easy.
7589000	7591000	And then...
7595000	7597000	And I remembered,
7597000	7601000	as I was climbing the antenna spire,
7601000	7604000	I remembered, wait, my mother,
7604000	7606000	her last dying thing,
7606000	7611000	as the heronado was sucking her into the vortex,
7611000	7614000	she threw the pills at me and said,
7614000	7618000	should anything happen, take these pills.
7618000	7621000	And I did, and then I went back in time
7621000	7623000	to where we were a happy family,
7623000	7626000	but I was always able to access everything post that.
7626000	7630000	So not only am I currently with my happy family
7630000	7633000	knowing what the future will bring,
7633000	7637000	but I also concurrently run in the shadows,
7637000	7640000	because I fucking love that song.
7640000	7644000	Wow, what a character.
7644000	7646000	I think that's the end of our show.
7646000	7648000	Wait, I have my guy.
7648000	7649000	What's that?
7649000	7651000	I have a guy, too.
7651000	7653000	Oh, God, oh, God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
7653000	7656000	Oh, don't forget me saying,
7656000	7659000	I think that's the end of our show.
7659000	7660000	I'm just going to read this,
7660000	7663000	and that will be the end of the show.
7663000	7666000	My guy talks like me.
7666000	7668000	I'm just going to read what you said, is that okay?
7668000	7671000	That's fine with me, unless you have any great ideas
7671000	7675000	that have come up to the surface from these wonderful narrations.
7675000	7680000	Is there a hymnado?
7680000	7684000	When we looked at it, what we thought was...
7684000	7690000	It sounded like a herstory moment, but...
7690000	7694000	I'll have to check with the ladies at Vassar and Sarah Lawrence.
7694000	7697000	The feminist studies group, let's see what they think.
7697000	7699000	Spencer, what is a Shadow Runner?
7699000	7702000	A Shadow Runner is basically like a member of the A-Team.
7702000	7705000	When people need their help and they can afford it,
7705000	7707000	they get the A-Team, you know?
7707000	7709000	And they do illegal stuff, they do cool things.
7709000	7711000	But they're usually good guys?
7711000	7714000	No, I mean, they're criminals, they could be murderers, assassins.
7714000	7717000	They ride in a van and they have lunch boxes with their faces on it.
7717000	7722000	Typical mercenary.
7723000	7725000	I'm just going to read the paragraph.
7725000	7727000	Doctor Friend, that's my guy's name.
7727000	7729000	Unless you have a better name.
7729000	7733000	I don't think you can top Doctor Friend.
7733000	7737000	Dentist Friend.
7737000	7740000	Dentist Friend is the troll doctor.
7740000	7743000	Dentist.
7743000	7747000	A criminal slash doctor whose practice is everywhere the core aren't.
7748000	7751000	Corpse, like corpse corporations.
7751000	7753000	Sorry everybody.
7753000	7756000	Doctor Friend is a troll doctor.
7756000	7759000	I have to start over every time someone says something.
7759000	7762000	Do try periodontist.
7765000	7770000	Periodontist Friend is a troll periodontist.
7770000	7776000	A criminal slash periodontist whose practice is everywhere the corpse aren't.
7777000	7783000	Periodontist Friend has a magical mastery over medicine and the metahuman body.
7783000	7786000	With a less than firm commitment to the Hippocratic Oath.
7786000	7789000	Nice.
7791000	7793000	That was a little glib, that was a little glib.
7793000	7796000	With a less than firm commitment.
7796000	7800000	Alright CW, I see what you mean.
7800000	7806000	Periodontist Friend is bound to never harm anyone who hasn't harmed him first.
7806000	7809000	Originally a corporate periodontist.
7809000	7811000	For fun can you say endodontist?
7811000	7813000	Endodontist? What is that?
7813000	7816000	It's root canals.
7816000	7818000	Just root canals?
7818000	7820000	Yeah basically it's nerves.
7820000	7823000	Periodontist is guns and endodontist is root canals.
7823000	7826000	You sound so drunk right now.
7826000	7829000	It's basically nerves.
7829000	7831000	It's nerves.
7831000	7833000	Roots, root canals, nerves.
7834000	7836000	Endodontist?
7836000	7838000	Endodontist.
7838000	7840000	Okay.
7840000	7843000	I mean, it's not important.
7843000	7847000	Oh no, I didn't mean to qualify that as being important.
7847000	7849000	It's not important, say whatever you want.
7849000	7851000	Say periodontist.
7851000	7855000	I thought we were giving requests like you were a DJ at a birthday party.
7855000	7857000	So I said endodontist.
7857000	7861000	Originally a corporate endodontist.
7861000	7864000	One friend, that's me.
7864000	7867000	That's me.
7867000	7870000	One friend goblinized into a troll.
7870000	7872000	Goblin is not a verb.
7872000	7876000	Goblinization is a thing that happens in the history of the Shadowrun milieu.
7876000	7878000	The empiric virus.
7878000	7880000	I turned from human into a troll?
7880000	7883000	Yeah, trolls just get turned into them from humans.
7883000	7888000	He was cast out of the corporation with extreme prejudice,
7888000	7891000	forced to ply his trade in the streets.
7891000	7893000	Despite this fall from grace,
7893000	7899000	he only accepts payment from the moderately wealthy for his superior service,
7899000	7903000	treating the poor and needy free of charge.
7903000	7906000	Sounds like a good guy.
7906000	7909000	Sounds like a friend, that's right.
7909000	7911000	That's all I need to say, right?
7911000	7913000	I prefer not to fight, but when I must,
7913000	7916000	I tend to favor non-lethal weapons such as a stun baton or a gel
7916000	7919000	and shock rounds from my silent submachine gun.
7919000	7922000	That sounds like a very violent weapon.
7922000	7927000	I use no weaponry other than the submachine gun.
7928000	7931000	I think at a moment when someone would go,
7931000	7936000	that's really nice that you take care of poor people for free,
7936000	7940000	you say it in an alleyway just to that other person, you go,
7940000	7946000	the poor become the rich, and the rich are always dying,
7946000	7950000	and there will always be more poor.
7950000	7952000	Did you just come up with that quote?
7952000	7954000	That's really good.
7954000	7955000	Are you being sarcastic?
7955000	7956000	No.
7956000	7957000	Really?
7957000	7958000	It's really good.
7958000	7960000	It's like the blind guy in Minority Report.
7960000	7962000	Yeah, I don't know. I like it.
7962000	7964000	I think I might be a little drunk.
7964000	7967000	I should be riffing like dialogue for you.
7967000	7968000	That was really good.
7968000	7969000	Thank you.
7969000	7972000	Does the logic collapse under the poor become the rich?
7972000	7973000	I was thinking that, too.
7973000	7976000	Doesn't that stop right there?
7976000	7978000	This is a fantasy world, David.
7978000	7981000	It's a weird world where if you're poor, you're safe,
7981000	7983000	but you have teeth problems,
7983000	7987000	and then only your ambition to become rich eventually kills you.
7987000	7990000	I like that this is the least believable bit of this for you.
7990000	7992000	The poor become the rich.
7992000	7995000	Now I've heard everything.
7995000	7998000	Shadowrun's a fun game, but in terms of wealth distribution...
7998000	7999000	Yeah.
7999000	8000000	A lot like our world.
8000000	8004000	I'm not sure I believe it.
8004000	8006000	All right. Well, we've conquered all these worlds.
8006000	8008000	Now how do we end things?
8008000	8010000	Probably with a rap, right? I'll do a rap.
8010000	8015000	Do a rap.
8015000	8022000	Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap,
8022000	8024000	and he clapped, time to rap.
8024000	8029000	Every rap has some kind of rap jazz.
8029000	8033000	When you rap your ass, the person you came in as,
8033000	8038000	and I accept you, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
8038000	8039000	I accept you.
8039000	8042000	Isn't it funny that David thinks that this is your rap every time?
8042000	8044000	I would say the great thing would be to do a rap
8044000	8047000	and have David Cross, who has a beautiful angelic voice,
8047000	8052000	do the rap bridge, the R&B, like...
8052000	8053000	Doo-doo-doo.
8053000	8055000	Do we have a rap beat?
8055000	8057000	I think so, yeah, yeah.
8057000	8060000	All right.
8060000	8062000	So I'll do a little bit and then I'll cue you
8062000	8065000	and then you do like the, you know, the bridge.
8065000	8067000	The singing part.
8067000	8078000	We hope you come back to the show.
8078000	8086000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8086000	8090000	City sirens, police in the distance, cityscape,
8090000	8092000	I'm gonna go the distance.
8092000	8096000	I'm Dr. Urban Anthropy.
8096000	8098000	I'm gonna cut you, can't you see?
8098000	8101000	I'm going through the shadows at night.
8101000	8104000	I'm gonna rap for my life, gonna fight for your life.
8104000	8106000	I'm Mr. Mix-A-Plink.
8106000	8108000	I'm gonna shoot you.
8108000	8112000	I'm gonna fucking shoot you in the tooth, you.
8112000	8114000	I'm gonna shoot you in the shoot, you.
8114000	8118000	And then I'll put your life inside my shoe, though.
8118000	8124000	Rhyme and Shoo-Choo with Shoo-Choo.
8125000	8128000	I'm gonna rhyme a life with line.
8128000	8131000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8131000	8136000	Gonna rhyme one word with the exact word again.
8136000	8141000	And that's how I rap my line.
8141000	8144000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8144000	8145000	All right.
8145000	8147000	David Cross.
8147000	8149000	That's our show.
8149000	8157000	I'll see you next week, I think.
8161000	8163000	Did you get any of that?
8163000	8165000	It's a cool show.
