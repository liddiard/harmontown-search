0	18320	Hello. Look at this green suit. That's fantastic. What's your name, sir? James in the green
18320	24400	suit. I love it. Did you win the Augusta National? What happened? It was a super villain suit.
24400	37760	All right. Here's a joke. Hello, win and all. I'm your cop trouble Jeff Davis. Harman Town is now
37760	46880	in session. It's good to be back. It feels like it's been a long, long time. Let's bring out
46880	50080	our Game Master because I love him and adore him. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.
54400	67280	What up, Spencer? Oh, yeah. How are you feeling, man? I'm feeling couched. I got a couch. You've
67280	74640	upgraded from chair to couch. Oh, yeah. All right. I hate it. For my hip, I'm 62.
77360	80240	Is your hip hurting you? Oh, yeah. I'm dying.
80240	86160	All right. We all speak and die. Let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Herman.
86160	109440	Dan, you sound like you might be a little under the weather.
110240	121440	Yeah, I get sick like once every two years. I guess this is it. Stayed up a couple too,
121440	128240	too many days and just caught something, I guess. Don't use this microphone.
129440	134480	I might be playing it up a little bit. You know how you could do that? You sound like a Haul's
134480	139200	Mental Lipness commercial from the 90s. A death that could penetrate this stuff eat those.
140080	146160	If you're 100% healthy, you can't fake like sounding sick, but if you're like 5% sick,
146160	152400	you can crank it up to like 70% easy. You just have to like, it's actually a matter of just not
153280	159440	doing anything. You just like, you just do less so that you sound real sick.
159440	162560	Is it the kind of sickness that you can enjoy because you have like tomato soup
162640	166560	and a grilled cheese sandwich and some hot cocoa and you watch TV or is it a bummer?
168560	173360	Look, I'm not in any physical pain. It's the kind of sick that's a manifestation of the
173360	180560	psychological misery I'm in. It's self-imposed. My therapist and I are making some real breakthroughs,
180560	187680	but unfortunately, it's like realizations of how fucked up I am. She's really getting through to
187680	195040	me. What's the headlines of your- Just like how I'm like a creature of denial.
196320	200800	Just kind of like stuff that, I don't know, it doesn't sound as profound when you repeat it, but
201840	207600	like, I've been not finishing this script for like weeks, so every week I go in there
208240	212640	and she's like the one person I don't have to lie to. That's not gonna behoove me to lie to,
212640	218560	so I could just go in and go, nope, nope, I didn't turn it in again. Instead of being like,
218560	226560	oh, I'm almost done or whatever. It's been kind of a case study in just the process and how it
226560	232720	gets hung up and blocked and fucked up and what's going on in my head, how I managed to make my
232720	239040	process difficult. This has got to be the last time I ever do this. I'm not doing it no more.
239040	243360	I'm not writing anything by myself anymore because I can't do it. There's something wrong
243360	247760	with me. That's what we figured out and the thing is she's like, yeah, there's something wrong with
247760	254240	you. She's like, I think you got to admit that there's something uncontrollable. That's what you
254240	258080	have to do in situations like this. You got to treat it like an addiction. You're basically
258080	266480	addicted to fucking up your deadlines. You will have a thought in your head. This is what I thought
266560	270080	was interesting because I think you can apply this to anything and I'm sure it's like AA talk
270080	275920	too. It's like, but it's like the idea that you can, whatever you're up against,
278080	281600	there are some things that you can't control, some thoughts you can't control
283440	291040	and so procrastination or things like that. There's some things where the reason why you
291040	294480	keep doing the same fucked up shit over and over again is because the thought is in your head
294560	300400	already. You don't get a choice. You're not there at the point where you're making the
300960	306080	choice to think. Haven't you ever like, everybody's got something, whether you're a smoker or a
306080	311280	drinker. I think it's more profound when it's not something like that, but it helps to use that
311280	319680	stuff as metaphorically when you realize like, oh, look at your procrastination as like a cigarette
319680	323680	because what are you getting out of it? I don't know. I've been puzzling through it for weeks
323680	327760	going like, what is it? What am I addicted to the shame? Am I like afraid to be happy and all
327760	333520	that stuff sounds so cornball? And then it was finally like, she's like, she's like, look,
333520	338480	it doesn't matter. Like it's like the answer, it doesn't matter if you get, if you figure that
338480	342240	shit out or not, you're kind of addicted to trying to figure shit out. First of all,
342880	348160	like that's part of the process is that you, you, you, but I think what you have to accept is that
348160	355040	there's like a wall of ice in your brain that like is there before you choose it. I'm sorry,
355040	359360	I'm repeating myself, but that, that, that, that like, that's the profound thing is that,
359360	365520	is that it's already there and, and the, and the, and the only way to do anything about it is you
365520	373920	got to accept that, okay, I'm going to be thinking this fucked up thought before way before I ever
373920	379760	even, it's there. It's like a time traveler. It's just there before it's pre-fucked up,
379760	383920	whatever your relationship that if you've always fucked up your relationships, if you don't have
383920	388080	ever whatever way, you're self destructive. It's like, like think of these things that always,
388080	393760	you do always seem to do stop waiting for you to like figure out how to do it differently
393760	399760	with an epiphany or something and just accept that, you know, first things first, like I always
399760	404960	do this. I'm always thinking this before I even decide I'm thinking it. And, and I like, I'll even
404960	408720	deny that I'm thinking of it or I'll think of something else. Cause until you admit that,
408720	413120	and then, you know, that language is familiar until you accept that you've got this problem,
413680	417600	like you can't do the thing that you need to do, which is take contrary action,
417600	422400	which is just the equivalent of like a fucking situp. But you kind of have like two addictions
422400	429920	then don't you? Because I got no addictions. If you have a procrastination addiction,
429920	435760	you also have an addiction to creating stuff. Like, that's a huge part of who you are. Well,
436640	443920	I'd like to call that bluff as soon as possible. I mean, I like making stuff. I like making stuff
443920	449920	I don't have to make though. Well, yeah, wouldn't we all, we'd all like to have created a thing
449920	454640	that we didn't have to work hard on. Like I would like to have a book. I'm never going to
454640	460800	sit down and write one cause I'm a lazy, terrified, bad writer. Oh man, Jeff, you gotta get a ghost
460800	467200	writer. I'd read your book. It'd be all your cool stories. What, what if I actually got a real ghost?
467200	474160	Oh, that'd be great. I know a guy. The Exorcist. I'll ghost write your book as a ghost right now.
474960	483440	Oh, chapter one. Oh, room full of dicks. I can't wait to suck them. That's problematic.
483440	489760	Oh, ghost writer. I got you. It's me, Dan. I died.
492320	499120	Just to do this bit. Don't go in the west wing. It stinks. I ate myself to death.
499840	505520	My body doesn't stink. It's the food. I don't know. What's it? Why, why, what are you trying
505520	510720	to add onto that for selling past the clothes? How many current like deadlines do you have?
510720	514240	Like I, how many projects? I got them down to like, I'm going to count them.
516080	522240	Like I got one. It's this thing that I've been kvetching about for the last couple of weeks.
522240	530880	Um, and, uh, it was truly due today. It's like the, all these projects, like they always have,
530880	536000	they're all, they're always be like a guy who's like, it's just the fucking,
536000	539280	it's the saddest thing. Like this is the look back at my life and I go like,
539920	545120	oh, these poor people that like, that I get permission from, you know, and just go like,
545120	550400	oh man, can I have one more day? And like, yeah, man, it's all good. I'm like, oh, you're such a,
550400	554640	you're such a good guy. I'm like, I was just trying to go back through my life and go like,
554640	559600	how many of them get rewarded for this patients? Like, should they just come over to my house and
559600	564960	punch me? Once you better, when you had like a Stewart Krenfeld that would just yell at you and
564960	569920	say, where is it? Where is it? I don't know if he got more or less for his, where is it? Where is it?
569920	575840	I don't know. Jack Rapkis was like, was like, you know, I, the thing that I, I mean, it was just,
575840	580320	but I, I still didn't like, I still just shit out monster house at the end of it and like gave
580320	586880	it to him. Cause, but it was like, but I remember him going like, like the, I don't know, like the
586880	592480	third time he had to call me and then the rep key at image movers and I was writing monster house.
592480	596720	This was 20 years ago, but it still sticks out in my head that he was, cause he was just like
596720	602960	old school Hollywood and like fuck was every other word is such a, like really like interesting guy.
603760	607360	Um, like, like, I mean that, like, it was just like, like, it was just like,
607360	613760	everything was fucking this and fucking that and Hey, listen, I got it. Um, uh, and then he,
613760	618320	like, I just remember him coming like, like I, I told him like a third time, like, yeah,
618320	622000	I'm not quite done yet. I'm still working on stuff, but I just kind of, whatever.
622000	626400	And there was just a slog silence and he goes like, all right, well I'll tell you what,
626400	633600	fucking Dan, uh, at this point, uh, not going to bother calling you anymore.
633600	637760	Cause there's no fucking credibility here. So I'm like, that's all I remember.
637760	642960	I was, I was like, damn, no credibility. Shit. I can go get a sandwich now.
644560	646720	Wait, that didn't light a fire under your ass.
646720	650720	No, it just made me feel real bad. But you still finished it.
650720	652400	Kind of. Not really. Did you see that
652400	657360	fucking thing? What did it, like, it's like, it's like the first 20 pages is great. And then
657360	660880	it's like, it's probably not even great anymore. Cause it's like, oh, whoa,
660880	663520	you want to have sex with that girl scout? That's that, that aged well
667920	670560	two kids ordering or arguing over who gets to,
671280	673200	is, is, is deadless one of these things that you're working on?
673200	677600	Nah. I mean, that's a, I wouldn't call that a deadline necessarily. That's like an active
677600	680880	project that I'm very excited about. I'm not like, there's nobody that's like,
680880	686000	you're fucking me over. I, so wait. Okay. So I'm counting the one thing. And then I do think,
686560	690240	like, I just got a bunch of shit off, like one, two, three things off my plate.
691200	694880	And yeah, I think that's it. I think, I think that's truly it.
695520	699920	And you only have 50,000 more episodes of Rick and Morty to write.
699920	703920	Which is, no, Rick and Morty's like, I don't want to say it's easy, but it's like, it's,
703920	708880	it's, it's a healthy process now. You know, like it's, it's like Rick and Morty's like,
709760	718720	you know, we're, it, it, it's, it's, it's fine. Like I, that's the job that I want. That's the job
718720	722720	that I signed the deal to do. And as soon as I got that contract, I was like, okay,
722720	728400	let's start wrapping up all of these other dalliances. And there was just like 50 of them.
729120	735520	Because, because like, what are you supposed to do? You don't, you don't, you know, there's no,
735520	740560	I mean, look, I'm one of the luckiest writers in Los Angeles, in the, in the TV industry,
740560	749440	gotta be one of the 1% luckiest in, in, in, in, in a field that if you're represented in paying
749440	755360	your rent writing that those, those people represent like top whatever percent of the
755360	760320	population of the planet in terms of luxury, in terms of like, you know, the amount of work you
760320	763760	have to do for the amount of money you get. And then I'm, I'm up in the upper echelon of those
763760	768800	people. Cause I make like, I'll get a check from community sometimes and I'll get a check from,
768800	774320	from, from this or that. And it's still like, until I got that Rick and Morty deal, I was like,
774320	778560	well, yeah, but how am I going to retire? And then you get, it's like, I guess that segues into this
778560	783760	WGA thing. Like, I guess I got it. I got it. Everybody firing their agent. Okay, good. All
783760	787840	right. Yeah. Yeah. I've been on the road and, and not totally hip to that. Like what, what,
787840	792640	what is the deal with the WGA deal? Packaging, Jeff, it's all about packaging.
792640	798480	You know about packaging. I'm packaging right now. Right. We're all packaging.
798480	805040	I really can't speak with authority. I can't even go ahead. No, I don't know. Packaging is
805040	811040	when the agents basically cut themselves further into the pie for making deals with multiple
811040	817760	talents and parties. So they, they tell, they say, Hey, literary agent, like we'll get this writer
817760	824800	and Hey TV agent and Hey TV actor, we'll get you. And also we'll get 10% more of everyone's money.
825440	830240	You know, if everyone's deals for packaging, so they get 10% on top of the money they already
830240	836000	get from the individual parties. And I'm probably way off, but that's a big part of it because it's
836000	841520	just them, you know, cutting, cutting a huge chunk more of the money than they're already being paid
841520	848160	to get. And so yeah, the WGA is, this guy has chunks of money or carving you anti-carving.
850160	856080	Who does that affect? The worst is the WGA, the writers, because they no longer have the same
856080	864320	connections and, and there's probably, obviously this is a union of very smart people that like
864320	870960	to type a lot. So there's a lot of invective, a lot of like Patrick Henry, give me my quill or give
870960	878720	me my, my sword kind of stuff online. That'll make you, I mean, I, I, I really, I don't know
878720	884960	how you, once it's 97, 95%, you know, turning out in a vote, which it's like, I'm just going to
884960	892640	defer to my better crafts people who have thought about this more. And I did talk to a couple of
893520	898000	colleagues and said, like, look, can you explain this to me? And like, because if all this is,
898400	902800	that we're, that, that times are hard all over, that Rome is burning. And so everyone's just
902800	907280	starting to grab each other and shake each other down, you know, and the package is just a cluster
907280	912720	of money that we're like, okay, now let's worry about that. Now that it's not the cocaine 80s
912720	916960	anymore. And like, there's not money just like everywhere. But, and then someone was like, no,
916960	920160	no, no, it's not, it's, it's, it's lack of transparency and stuff like that. And they
920160	924800	kind of walked me through it. And I took my, you know, my, my agents took me out to dinner
925440	935360	and, uh, uh, there's such a sweet, sweet table of little cherubs. They're human beings. They didn't,
935360	941360	they didn't choose, uh, this stuff. They don't run their, their agency or the industry for the last
941360	946560	30 years. And they're, they're a little broken hearted that writers are such, uh, we're so
946560	952880	dramatic when we set our mind to something like they just, they're feeling like very bad.
953440	958000	You're saying writers are dramatic. Yeah. I think it's very, I always thought it was very profound.
958000	963840	I mean, I, that, that like we have this industry out here where, you know, things that in any other
963840	968720	part of the world might be just too frivolous for there to be such compartmentalized and
968720	975280	industrialized, like division of labor. And, uh, because even, you know, that we developed these
975280	984320	breeds and that it's, you know, I, I'm so thankful that there's this like breed of industry person
984320	991760	that does just every part of the job of working as a writer that I would rather kill myself than do,
991760	997920	which I mean, notably just like selling me, like telling people that I'm good and that I should
997920	1003440	have a job. I would, if I, I would never, I would die of starvation before I did that would never
1003440	1007760	be like, well, I'm pretty good writer. I think, uh, I think you should maybe, what are you doing
1007760	1012640	over here? Like a Star Trek reboot? Like, look, I've been, I've been, I've been loving Star Trek.
1012640	1016320	Maybe you've seen some of my work. Here's something you can read. Like, I don't know if they're going
1016320	1020560	pretty good. Like I would just like, nah, I'm going to do it myself. I didn't know that John Travolta was a
1020560	1025440	writer. John Travolta, what are you working on right now? You got a, you got a new script for us?
1026400	1035360	I'm working on, uh, uh, uh, uh, tell all about, uh, the set of Broken Arrow.
1037600	1040560	I got to say Broken Arrow is not my favorite John Travolta movie.
1040560	1048080	Hey, well, uh, why don't you, uh, take a flying hose on a rubber hose? I sound like Bobcat Goldthwaite.
1048080	1056160	Uh, what did they say on Welcome Back Connor? Take a, take a, sit on a rubber hose or
1056160	1060640	take a, put your, up your nose with a rubber hose. Thank you. Thank you. I always say up your butt
1060640	1064320	with a coconut, but that wasn't from Welcome Back Connor. No, I don't think you could say that back
1064320	1068000	then. Yeah, you couldn't say up your butt. They wouldn't say up your nose if they could say up
1068000	1073200	your butt. Right. They're like, we got to put it somewhere. And they're like, you get it. The nose
1073200	1079120	is like the ass. I always say happy days when they would say sit on it. Sit on it seems almost
1079120	1083520	worse than up your nose. Yeah. Sit on it. What am I supposed to sit on? Probably your dick, right?
1084400	1089280	I'm assuming either. Well, they were in the, they were usually in the men's room when they
1089280	1094080	told somebody to sit on it. And honestly, like no, like, like regardless of what you're sitting on,
1094080	1098800	it's probably going up your ass. I mean, there's, there's really no getting around that. I can't
1098880	1103280	believe that, uh, who made a happy days? Who was the creator on that one? Gary Marshall.
1103280	1109520	Is it Gary Marshall? I had his office at Paramount. Oh yeah. Yeah. My office was scary. That wasn't
1109520	1113680	your, uh, your eccentric days when you would show up at Paramount in a fucking bathrobe,
1113680	1117840	like one of the Wieckowski brothers or whatever, right? Yeah. I guess sometimes I do that,
1117840	1122880	then I get fired. But like, I mean, sometimes you got to edit in a Saturday. I'm not going to put
1122880	1129200	pants on. I shot that Daryl video in that office. It was Gary Marshall. Did you really,
1129200	1133200	did you really show up to Paramount? Isn't pajamas and slippers and stuff? Yeah, I would go there.
1133200	1137760	Like, like, yeah, like usually like when it was like in the thick of things, when it was like,
1137760	1142720	oh, you got to work on the weekends, which I would, but it was like, oh, I got to go in on the weekend
1142720	1147520	and I'm just going to sit and pull into Paramount's lap, go into an edit bay and sit there for six
1147520	1153200	hours and ship an episode. Well, who can, yeah, that's where I'll wear. I saw you in a, in a me
1153200	1157920	onesie in the last episode of this, you came out and your little Jimmy jams. Yeah, that was really
1157920	1162800	good. Oh, all right. Well, so we got, we do have some, uh, some items to go over. Like, I, I feel
1162800	1172480	like this one's kind of urgent because for fans of my workout, uh, I, they made a couple days ago,
1172480	1177920	a couple of workouts ago, we were talking about my coyote problem and I, I, I had ordered this
1177920	1183440	ghillie suit, like, uh, which is where you look like a swamp thing. And it came and I, I like,
1183440	1187200	I wore it during my workout and stuff, but I was like, you know, I was talking before. Wait,
1187200	1191360	hang on. Can I hit pause here for a second? What, why did you get a ghillie suit for your coyote
1191360	1197920	problem? My feeling at the time I was a little drunk, but I was like, I'm sorry. I was like,
1197920	1205040	maybe like wear it. And like, it was based on a threat I had made to the coyotes while really
1205040	1210560	drunk. Like I did like a Kevin Spacey monologue to the coyotes for like 20 minutes. So you verbally
1210560	1217040	to coyotes in your backyard or just to the universe itself? Like I did it under my breath,
1217040	1221920	but in a way that if my neighbors wanted to listen, like they would be a lot. It was kind of a,
1221920	1225680	because I was clearly talking. It was a taxi driver. You talk to me kind of thing,
1225680	1230400	but it was like coyotes. Yeah. I was like projecting like this, like, I was like,
1230400	1235600	cause I just, I was just finished shooting some slingshot, like clay biodegradable clay balls into
1235600	1242320	the, these things are getting so aggressive. You've already invested in anti coyote weapon
1242320	1249440	range. Yeah. Yeah. I got like this crazy slingshot. Right. But it was like, but I still, you know,
1249440	1254640	I was like, like, and I shot it and like, like, you know, and into the, into the area.
1254640	1256640	Were you shooting at actual animals that you saw?
1258080	1263280	I couldn't see them, but I wouldn't aim at them. I wouldn't be my objective to hit them.
1264000	1268160	Cause I don't think that would do any good. I would rather just be a nuisance to them and
1268160	1273360	scare them. And the concern would be that they're going to come and eat Nigel or what? Yeah. Yeah.
1273600	1278080	Eventually that they're, because I feel like they're a, uh, they, they wouldn't be
1278080	1283920	two feet from my back door if they weren't already in some trouble, you know? So it's,
1283920	1290400	it's a, it's a tragedy for them, but they probably smell the pheromones or the dog food or whatever
1290400	1294480	that they, they just know that there's pets in the house. I know, but it's not like a natural,
1294480	1298080	like, it's not like a natural thing for Kaya. This is a recent thing.
1299120	1302960	Again, going back to the fires that we had, and I think like there was a big migration down.
1302960	1306560	There's been like a lot of aggressive coyote stuff. And I'm just saying, like, I have to
1306560	1312400	imagine that all of these coyotes that are like so active in Las Feliz right now, that they're,
1312400	1316960	they're up against it and that, and they're getting very aggressive. And what I worry about
1316960	1325200	is a combination of their aggression. And like, if they're starving, like them getting kind of loopy
1325200	1330480	or like, like I had, like I, you know, like abandoned pups or whatever, like, I don't want
1330480	1335760	to know the shit's going to hit the fan. If like some, you've seen these like crazy coyotes,
1335760	1341520	like broad daylight, like one that would just, that's just like, yeah, Paul, Paul Rustin,
1341520	1346400	Leslie, our friend's little dog got eaten. Like, and I heard it happen. It was fucking nuts.
1348000	1354640	Yeah. Well, put a pin in that. That's awful. You heard it. Put a pin in that. And their other dog,
1354640	1359200	which is a golden doodle, like yours, like Harvey, watched it happen. And they're like,
1359200	1364800	he was never the same again. Like he, he was fucking absolutely went insane while watching
1364800	1370160	his little friend get murdered by a pack of coyotes because I mean, Harvey can't even handle
1370160	1376800	watching a fucking cartoon about a deer without losing his shit. So Harvey, Harvey just will walk
1376800	1380960	in and he'll lay on his back and then pee on my shoe. Nah, come on. He doesn't pee that much.
1381920	1389520	Um, the, uh, so yeah, I'm just worried happened once. That's enough. I am worried about a like
1389520	1399440	juvenile hunger, starved, heat stroked, like, like fucking in cell coyote, just like on a,
1399440	1407520	on a comp on a speedball high of nothing to lose. And he's riding a lime scooter. He's coming down
1408400	1412400	grimace park Boulevard and he's pissed about the Szechuan size. He's like,
1413840	1417920	and just like, like either like just, just try, just like I'm going for broke. I mean,
1417920	1422880	life finds a way and like, and like there, what I'm worried about is the failure of that plan,
1422880	1430640	even more than the success of it, that, that like a injured kind of sick coyote landing in my yard
1430640	1435360	and then needing help from other coyotes or just freaking out. Cause it's like, I'm trapped. It
1435440	1441360	would be trapped in there. And if I was out, if I was out and it was like 3 PM and the doggy door
1441360	1447600	was unlocked and there's a coyote trapped in my backyard, Nigel's a fucking idiot. Like he,
1447600	1454160	he thinks that skunks are, are party favors. Like he's just like, yay, free skunk candy. You know,
1454160	1459840	like, like he has even skunked a lot. Yeah. Oh yeah. He got skunked like twice in the first
1459840	1466640	like two weeks of, of, of, of my relationship with Cody. Dogs don't learn about skunks.
1467200	1471760	You'd think that once bitten twice shy, but they fucking don't. They just say, Oh skunk again.
1471760	1477680	Harvey understands Harvey's got the, the, the, the, the, the, whatever genes in him where he's like,
1477680	1483040	he hangs back 20 yards and barks and goes like skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk. And Nigel's just
1483120	1489200	like like a torpedo and just, and then he just like, but like if, if Nigel gets out of bed,
1489200	1493760	starts barking and running downstairs, I panic and run because last time that happened,
1493760	1500320	I made it as far as the kitchen and he's coming back in the doggy door going with like fucking
1500320	1507280	mucus shooting out of his face and the whole house immediately smelling like, uh, like not,
1507280	1513920	it does not smell as much like weed. Uh, it smells like, uh, like poison. Like I had a skunk
1513920	1519680	apparently explode on my doorstep one time and my place, like you couldn't even breathe in my place.
1519680	1524640	It's in your shit forever. You have to throw away, like, like, like even just curtains and
1524640	1529200	stuff. It just gets in it. And there was, uh, at my new place, uh, there were, there was a family
1529200	1535040	of skunks. There was a mama and a papa and some babies and they're adorable. They're so cute.
1535760	1540400	And we just stood there. I came home at like midnight or 1am and there was just a Mexican
1540400	1546480	standoff. They just stood in front of my door for a half hour and I wasn't going anywhere.
1546480	1550640	They weren't going anywhere. Yeah. What do you do? You can't, you can't just like,
1550640	1557520	shoe them off. I clap, I clap my hands. Yeah. I usually makes them go away. Like,
1557520	1560640	I've had a couple of showdowns with a skunk where they're like, I don't want to do this
1560720	1571520	anymore than you do. I thought you're going to do a skunk clapping hands wrap.
1572800	1576800	Oh, cause it's clapping. I was like, what? I was trying to figure out what was awesome.
1579840	1584320	That was a skunk clapping hands wrap. You guys see that Scotty Bowers documentary,
1584320	1591120	the secret Hollywood guy. Yeah. He feeds his skunks. These guys, like he lives somewhere
1591120	1595440	here and he like, he puts out extra cat food for the skunks and they just come running right away.
1595440	1598640	Like they're like, they're just like waiting for him to put the food out. And then they,
1598640	1601520	I mean, that's what it looks like in that documentary. I'm like, I wonder if that's,
1601520	1607840	do those skunks not spray? They don't, if they feel comfortable, they don't, they don't like get
1607840	1612640	up on your shit. But if a dog comes go, like comes over and snarls at them, they're going to put
1612640	1616800	their butthole right on your face. And that's, that's the end of that. So this is why I bring
1616800	1621120	this up because a couple of workouts ago, I'm talking about the coyote problem and I'm like,
1621120	1625840	okay, yeah, that Spencer and Steve are ordering me like an airsoft gun or whatever. Like we're,
1625840	1630000	we're getting equipment, you know, I just want to be a, I just want to scare these coyotes into
1630000	1637760	having a larger birth around my yard. And, and then I go, I go, look. And I, and I said,
1637760	1642400	in case anybody out there has got their ears on to the live stream and you're like, oh,
1642400	1646560	you just, you want to be mean to animals. What's, what are they doing wrong? I was like,
1646560	1651440	really? No, I've tried everything. I've tried, you know, noise and don't tell me,
1651440	1655200	shake a coffee can at them with rocks in it. Like I've tried everything.
1655200	1658640	They're getting really aggressive. They don't care anymore. And Dave Klein said,
1658640	1664960	have you tried praying? And I, and I was like, you got me though. I have not tried praying.
1664960	1670800	That's true. Like before I go up in my ghillie suit. And so then I did this thing where I'm like,
1670800	1677440	cause I'm like, I look, I, you know, functionally, I may as well be an atheist in terms of like,
1677440	1684240	I don't, I don't do nothing for, for no, no deities. I don't, I don't pay nothing forward,
1684240	1692320	but, but culturally, I don't know, psychologically, like I'm, I'm like, I don't, I, I, I, I, I'm,
1692400	1697200	I'm panicking, even talking about it right now. Like I have this inborn like Midwestern,
1698560	1704720	if you blaspheme, like your God's just going to like, it is just, just seize the opportunity
1704720	1711520	to prove he exists just by fucking like taking one of your legs out. And, and so I was like,
1711520	1717360	okay, if I'm doing this, I gotta be real serious about it. So I very sincerely, you know, I would,
1717360	1720720	it made it very complicated. Cause I was like, no, I sound like a Dick. Like I'm like, and all
1720720	1725600	this stuff, but I did, went through this like prayer where I prayed for the coyotes to, as a
1725600	1730720	God, take, you know, if you want, if you want to fill these coyotes hearts with the desire to
1731360	1738000	relocate whatever it is, like, like don't, don't smite them. If it's, if it's a choice between
1738000	1742720	doing nothing and smiting, I, I'll deal with them. Like, I don't want anything smitten for me.
1743520	1751760	Um, it's smoten. I don't want, I don't want nothing smoke. Yo, don't be smoten. But I'm
1751760	1760960	smoking. What am I, am I in a rebel? Uh, uh, why the ghillie suits? Why did you get a ghillie suit?
1761760	1765840	It was part of the threat he made. Yeah. Oh, right. Cause I, when I was talking to him,
1765840	1769520	Kevin species style into the darkness, I was drunk and I was like in my underwear. And I was like,
1770160	1775120	I was just like, I felt a little emasculated, which I can say here cause they can't hear me,
1775120	1781840	but like I, I feel like it's all about like vibes and stuff. Like communica, like, if I, I,
1781840	1787280	I believe not with all animals, like I don't think you can talk to a hamster just to do it,
1787920	1794880	but I believe that it, when it, when it comes to, when it's a real situation of, of animus,
1794880	1799760	I guess you'd call it. Right. Like when it's, when it's significant, when it's,
1799760	1806240	when it's man versus beast on some level where it's like, okay, well we're neighbors now,
1806240	1811920	you know, like in the old days, when it predates our mimetic evolution and cuts right to the heart,
1811920	1817600	like we still have lizard brains. We still, we're still made of the same carbon from the same stars
1817600	1821440	as these little pieces of shit. Like, why do you buy a ghillie suit?
1821440	1829120	Because I told them I would because I, and if I, and if I do, if I say I'm going to do something,
1829120	1834080	I said, I'm coming up there. I said, I'm ordering shit from Amazon and you've got two weeks.
1834080	1839680	Why, why dress like a bush? I just sneak up on a, on a coyote who lives in bushes.
1839680	1844720	To scare the shit out of them. No, they're more scared of human beings dressed like not bushes.
1844720	1848160	They're not scared enough of human beings. They need to think that I'm psycho.
1849120	1852480	So any question you have, there's a question that they'll have.
1852480	1855200	A psycho bush and they're going to go, oh, I'm going to pee on that bush.
1855200	1858480	Oh, I hope so. Yeah. I hope they pee on me. And then I'm going to go,
1860320	1864160	and they're going to be like, what the fuck? They're going to bite you. I go bite me.
1865280	1871280	I'm a Bush man. Like, I just want him to be like, uh, not worth it.
1871280	1875920	I was, I was on the road. I was on the road telling a series of fantastic dick jokes
1875920	1880160	across the country. But I think I saw a picture of you dressed up in a ghillie suit.
1880160	1883200	Yeah. And I couldn't for the life of me,
1883200	1886320	try to reconstruct what the fucking purpose of that was.
1886320	1888560	I worked out in it and it felt really great.
1888560	1891200	So you put it on, do you, do you roll around?
1891200	1894720	I swear I could bench 20 more pounds wearing it. I felt, because I felt like this, like,
1894720	1898560	Do you, do you cruise around in your backyard at night hunting coyotes?
1898560	1905360	I haven't used it on them yet because as I told them, I said, I said, I said, I said to them,
1906880	1913040	I said, I said, you guys can stay as quiet or as loud as you want right now.
1914800	1918720	You do whatever you want. Like this isn't, I've told you before to be quiet
1920480	1921840	and you weren't. Right.
1921840	1924560	So we're past that point. There's no credibility now.
1927200	1930240	Yeah. Politeness has gone out the window with you and these coyotes.
1930240	1934640	I don't care if we're not playing games anymore. I'm not negotiating for fucking decibels.
1934800	1936160	You don't negotiate with coyotes.
1936160	1939520	Be quiet if I throw a rock. Oh, now you made more noise. Now you made less.
1939520	1943200	I'm telling you right now, too late. You may as well scream and shout
1943200	1946720	or you may as well be quiet. Still won't save you because here's what's going to happen.
1947360	1954160	I'm ordering a ladder from Amazon. And when it comes, I'm climbing up over this wall and
1954160	1955760	I'm coming up there. What?
1955760	1956240	Yeah.
1956240	1959440	And to what end, what's the end game when you get up?
1959440	1965360	Well, I feel like I feel like I feel like the effectiveness of that statement is in the
1965360	1972240	negative space. Like of like, I want them to be going, why? What are you going to do?
1974320	1979680	I said, you don't understand human society and I don't understand coyote society,
1980240	1984880	but I will tell you right now, you are dealing with a man with unexpressed rage
1984880	1989680	and on a on a seems like they can budget you.
1990720	1993200	They condition me. No, it seems like they keep pushing you.
1993200	1994880	Well, they keep pushing me. Yeah. Yeah.
1994880	1999600	No, I think I think it seems like they drew first blood. I think they are.
1999600	2002800	Right. Dan, this is them conditioning you. They've taught you to be a bush.
2002800	2006160	Yeah. You just you just got that idea from me mishearing Spencer.
2006160	2010560	I got to say that I I thought I knew how to fight coyotes.
2011360	2013360	Yeah. Was it wolves or coyotes?
2013680	2016720	I never imagined putting on a bush suit. This is next level.
2016720	2021600	I was thinking about getting coyote urine and put and putting coyote urine on the suit to like,
2021600	2027040	just just just just then you just do like contrary action.
2027040	2031920	You know, I missed I missed the wolf urine show. Tell me in a sentence or two,
2031920	2034640	what the point of urine colon. They hate that.
2034640	2038960	Wolves are like, well, coyotes are afraid of wolves unless they're having sex with them.
2039760	2045760	But that's that's genus canis for you. They're they're either they're either
2045760	2051600	breeding or eating each other. But the so so here's the thing that I just don't see the
2051600	2055760	point of dressing up like a bush to fight a coyote because you don't you want to be more
2055760	2062080	conspicuous and more of a threat to them and look I know I want to traumatize them mentally.
2063440	2067680	Did you think coyotes have that sort of mental capacity to remember things?
2067840	2072400	Yes, I think if it's a shock to their system and I'm not allowed to do that to them physically,
2072400	2078240	I can't and I wouldn't want to but because they're like I said, they're struggling like
2078240	2084720	it's like, you know, but they come down my street like like Waverly they come down and
2084720	2090320	they come down Griffith Park and Waverly and they silently like race. They just come down
2090880	2094560	and they walk down the street and they're looking around and they kind of hoot to each other.
2095360	2098880	And they're all looking around and they all go into somebody's backyard
2098880	2101360	and eat somebody's little dog or cat. I'll tell you what man.
2103040	2106800	And it's fucking gnarly and you see people you wake up and you hear the screaming
2106800	2112160	of the animal dying. And then you hear the screaming of the owner of the animal coming
2112160	2117920	out in their underwear, throwing like hair brushes and shoes at them and scaring them
2117920	2122080	off as they as they're devouring their little precious animals. It's not happening.
2122480	2126320	If I can talk to Paul Rest and Leslie Eifren about their dog dang, it's fucking really gruesome.
2127200	2131760	So so here's the thing though, we're living in an extraordinary times, you know,
2131760	2136960	like this is no this is not normal shit. Like the night that I did my monologue, like
2138480	2143200	it was like your monologue to the coyotes in your underwear. Yeah, it was like the purge
2143200	2148880	anarchy. Like like there was like there was a coyote and like right up on my shit going like
2149840	2155920	and but then like it was doing it because in the distance when it would shut up and you would hear
2155920	2161920	in the far distance like miles away, just this army. It was just like
2163920	2166720	late late and I was like these fuckers think that they're gonna keep
2167600	2173120	like pushing like they think that we're in the end days. They could probably smell that we are.
2173120	2178160	They're like they think they probably like they hear us talking about Trump in our bedrooms and
2178160	2185280	they're like sounds like it's coyote time. Sounds like we've entered the era of coyotes. Like I
2185280	2191520	might I might invent a lever next week. I might start I might be the Archimedes of coyotes. I
2191520	2199600	won't know unless I get lots of protein in me. Anyways, so so so I so I said to the coyotes that
2199600	2203840	night because it was like hearing this shit in the distance and I'm like I was like I just I
2203840	2210000	knew I had to like put on a strong face and be like I just I just I just you know just like kind
2210000	2216320	of counterintuitive. I was just like I'm glad you're quiet now. I hope you're quiet uh forever
2216320	2221520	because but it doesn't matter because like I'm getting a ladder from Amazon and I'm coming up
2221520	2226160	here. Is Armantown going to be about canine predators for the rest of time now because we
2226160	2231600	got wolf urine and we got coyotes? Well I don't know we could get through it if you'd I mean
2231600	2235760	like look I had this I had one thing to say about this which was that during my workout
2236320	2240560	then I said I was explaining all this to Dave Klein. Dave Klein says have you tried praying?
2240560	2248160	I prayed. So look what I said in my prayer also is like look God uh you know obviously
2248800	2253440	if the coyotes don't come back not that not that there needs to be anything in this for you
2254160	2260960	but if the coyotes just disappear now uh you know I'm gonna tell the story and I'm not gonna
2260960	2266560	leave you out I'm not gonna like whitewash like I'm not gonna be like oh you know like I'm and I
2266560	2271200	know and I don't I don't mean that yeah I know you like that PR you like that you like that
2271200	2276960	acknowledgement you know I don't know you don't thrive on it but I will I would I I promise I
2276960	2282080	will tell people I prayed for the coyotes to go away and then they went away that'll be my story
2282080	2288160	and I sit here tonight to tell you like I haven't heard the fucking coyotes since I prayed for them
2288160	2298400	to go away oh shit I uh now now now some some of you the atheist fans it's okay that's all right
2298400	2303760	I love atheists we need them we need skeptics we need we need them more than than than than ever
2303760	2309760	uh uh uh you guys can uh just assume that it was the Kevin Spacey monologue
2310640	2315360	because I told them I said I said get your shit I said I said I said look it doesn't matter what
2316160	2321680	Kevin Spacey from what from from House of Cards of our commercials from his uh from his Christmas
2321680	2324640	Christmas apron video on YouTube
2328000	2332880	was that branded I was pretty fucked up I got in the plane today from Boston back to LA and the
2332880	2338480	first thing I saw was that Notre Dame was on fire in Paris that really bummed me out oh no oh yeah
2338560	2344080	what happened was it nazis no oh I think so but no it's saying that yet
2344960	2349840	just just push backs I don't I don't think that the uh the the verdict is in on what happened
2349840	2354000	right they might they were doing reconstruction on it and it might have been like a construction
2354000	2358800	accident the actual church yeah the the whole roof fell in the main spire fell in that was built
2358800	2366560	like in 1840 or something that all fell in uh most of the superstructure and stone and the bell
2366560	2370720	towers stayed up but there was a very big chance that all the bells were gonna fucking fall down
2370720	2376800	and kill everybody the firefighters in there but uh friends of ours uh like church has friends and
2376800	2381520	I have friends that were like live right across the descend from it and watch the whole thing
2381520	2387120	catch on fire and there was people singing Ave Maria and French and it was or maybe Latin I don't
2387120	2395040	know absolutely beautiful and I don't think you have to be religious to be really struck by the
2395040	2401600	fact that uh and nearly what 900 year old building is just fucking in a towering inferno
2401600	2408240	and the whole roof fell in it's really it was really gruesome and it was uh it put me in a
2408240	2414000	pretty bad mood and I hope that uh they can rebuild it and make it good so some very rich
2414000	2421120	Frenchman uh businessman said he's going to give like a like a hundred million euro just to start
2421760	2429920	the rebuild on it which is better yeah no shit and then a friend of mine uh Brian who's a very
2429920	2434800	good friend he made like the joke because I posted a picture of me that I took in front of the uh
2434800	2440480	Notre Dame like maybe like three four years ago and he's like oh yeah yeah let's let's make sure
2440480	2445440	that I don't have a picture of myself in front of Notre Dame so I guess I can't make it about me
2445440	2449040	and I was like I don't think it's making about you I don't think it's vanity I think that's just
2449040	2455680	grief and we had a very very good conversation about that I think social media does want you to
2455680	2460320	make things about yourself or like we just are parakeets pecking at our own reflection and stuff
2460880	2465200	but I think to have visited Notre Dame and to be sad that the thing is fucking on fire
2466480	2473840	isn't vanity I think that's uh I think that's an expression of grief about watching one of uh
2474800	2480640	the world's great pieces of architecture die in front of us and uh I don't know
2481360	2487760	that made me very depressed in Notre Dame in in in in the in the states in uh was it Indiana
2487760	2492960	or is it university or something where's Notre Dame and oh it's just a college I think it's not
2492960	2498480	a city is it Indiana where is it south bend indiana yeah but there's no city it's just the
2498560	2502960	name of the it's not too dumb to parry it's uh it's the it's the Our Lady of Paris and that's
2502960	2509280	the big church on the uh uh what's the the oldest sitay whatever like right right on the island of
2509280	2514560	uh in the middle of the Seine River and it's right in the heart of France and it's probably
2514560	2519600	the most iconic church uh ever I would have been less upset if the Sistine Chapel burned down to
2519600	2530080	the fucking uh Notre Dame that's whoa shots fired hot takes shots fired yeah friends of mine like
2530080	2533760	that live right by it there's just pictures of just smoke and then there's people that
2533760	2538080	were up in Montmartre and uh like the Sacre Coeur like you're looking down on Paris and you just
2538080	2545520	see in the middle of Paris the most famous thing in the world just raging in fire um
2545520	2552720	um it uh it really really affected me it made me really really sad so supposedly the bells
2552720	2557840	are still standing and they they've saved the towers and whatnot but they're gonna have to
2557840	2569920	rebuild it they gotta they've done it they'll do it I haven't seen a game of thrones yet oh boy
2570000	2570800	that's a good segue
2575760	2579360	yeah also didn't Jackie Robinson turn 100 today if he was still alive
2583120	2587600	there's a whole lot of shit going on today man it's emotionally charged I haven't seen it either
2587600	2593680	I also I got a new receiver from DirecTV and I don't think I have my shit set to record game
2593680	2598000	of thrones so I might have to go back there and fucking have to sneak I wanted to watch that
2598000	2603600	Scotty Bowers documentary so I I went to apple tv and then and then I went to and then that
2603600	2610960	took me to amazon and then amazon told me I had to get stars through amazon and then stars said
2612720	2619120	hey do you want to do you uh after your free trial do you want to get charged monthly or
2619120	2627840	yearly if you get charged yearly you save 50 percent for only 79 a year for stars and I was
2628400	2636720	like so I paid like 80 bucks for a movie about a guy that was gay with Spencer Tracy like I'll
2636720	2641760	never what am I gonna browse stars what's wrong with me I don't know I guess I'd be like what's
2641760	2646800	wrong with me even more though if I did the monthly thing because I'm saving 70 bucks that's right
2649680	2652160	I don't know so Jackie Robinson was a uh
2653120	2658240	african-american ball player who is not sorry that's a real interesting documentary I would I
2658240	2665440	would I would I would recommend for people very very very uh ambient I don't know it's not like
2665440	2669280	it's got it's not like a big roller coaster ride like oh my god I can't believe this happened but
2669280	2673360	it's just like an interesting portrait what's the one I was just here I heard about today
2673360	2680000	there's a documentary about a dude that free climbed uh all capitan and Yosemite or what's
2680000	2688400	it called free solo that's supposed to be fucking crazy right is it good yeah we got we got four
2688400	2693920	yes hell yeah and all of his friends are dead right because everybody that tries to do that
2693920	2700960	fucking dies don't fucking do that I watch that uh you guys watch I harness it when I go down
2700960	2709040	staircases you know I have serious uh acrophobia which I think that's what that's what it is
2709040	2714240	it's fear of heights right it'll be acrophobia like Cody and I are looking at houses and I
2714240	2720640	there was a house I looked at we were never gonna get it but like it was like it just had this
2720640	2726400	balcony and it was like I couldn't go out on it I mean I could but I was like I can't I couldn't
2726400	2730800	live here it never occurred to me like I've been in hotels you know all the time you're in a hotel
2730800	2740160	and like I can't like I don't I wonder where I am on the you know ordinary meter of like people
2740160	2745040	that can't like last uh New Year's Eve or the one before we sing the microvelos thing we were we
2745040	2749520	were on a very precipitous balcony the whole time on that one yeah when I go up to a balcony
2749520	2756480	balcony like that like my legs get numb I I'm seized with what I've read is described but I
2756480	2762720	couldn't put words onto it before I read it in this like coffee table book about phobias but
2762720	2767840	it's it talked about how people are people with this phobia are particularly disturbed by what
2767840	2775200	they describe as a as a as a as a uncontrollable thought about jumping yeah because I think your
2775200	2779760	brain is just running through the fear of heights I say is not so much a fear of falling is a fear
2779760	2786400	of jumping yeah but it's also like like I notice like if I'm holding an object or if anyone around
2786400	2791120	me is holding an object like I can't stand watching Cody with the fuck like that New Year's
2791120	2796640	where Cody's just like you know hi and she's got like like what it was a whether it's a phone or
2796640	2802880	a glass I'm just like the thought of this thing like like dropping yeah like just freaks me out
2802880	2807520	yeah I think it's like I think I think the I don't know I've read or something that the
2807520	2813440	idea is it's like your brain is kind of doing flashcards or it's like what if I jump no bad
2813440	2818800	that would be bad what if I grab this cop's gun no that would be bad what if I like did a sandwich
2818800	2823680	or something that'd be fine you know but it's just like it's just the brain is kind of reinforcing
2823680	2829920	the negative mental and emotional what if you're on a balcony with a cop what if you're on a balcony
2829920	2834880	with a cop grab their gun and just jumped off that'd be great and then they're like he didn't
2834960	2837200	you'd be an absolute legend my man
2840880	2845920	they'd call you Hans Gruber but yeah I get it the most with phones I'm just always imagining
2845920	2851200	like dropping phones off bridges or opening up the hotel of a window of a hotel just to drop my
2851200	2857440	phone out and I'm like this is bad I gotta get out of here I do a lot of shows in the Bay Area
2857440	2862080	and so we're constantly going back and forth across the Golden Gate where people kill themselves all
2862080	2868400	the time and I'm fascinated by I had a cousin who did that huh I had a cousin who did that
2868400	2873360	who did what he killed himself on the bridge he jumped off the bridge your cousin it's sad
2873360	2880160	which side any side or the other side uh my mom's uh sister's no I mean what side of the bridge you
2880720	2887760	you fucking suicide nephew up river stop making this about you Spencer
2888720	2894480	which side is the production because some people that's awesome most people jump off
2895680	2899360	most people jump off uh facing the city because they want to see San Francisco as they kill
2899360	2904160	themselves but once in a while some punk rockers fucking go off the other side yeah I don't read
2904160	2909200	I don't know that that was written down I mean I'm sure it was right I don't know if it was brought
2909200	2914480	up but yeah I have nothing in common with if they didn't want people to jump off the Golden Gate
2915200	2919680	bigger fences they stop putting a little sign that says hey call this number if you're feeling
2919680	2922960	about you're thinking about killing yourself yeah there is stuff they can do and I can't remember
2922960	2929120	why they don't do what they can do I think I don't I don't I don't know it might maybe it's
2929680	2935600	maybe maybe it's constitutional fucking liberty maybe there maybe maybe it's San Francisco right
2935600	2939760	so there there maybe there's like a hippie in charge of the city and they're like hey man
2939760	2943280	six thousand people six thousand people kill themselves out the bridge every year and I still
2943280	2956080	can't get a parking spot oh yeah um thank you it used to be an age joke and I made it about the bridge
2956960	2961040	so you guys caught up on that uh on that glass trilogy
2961040	2972000	what you got you got you watch The Unbreakable then you watch the uh split and uh you got you

3025920	3031600	gonna be a what did you think like what did you think and then I was like you know what I liked

3047120	3057840	glass so I can round out the unbreakable trilogy and watch Bruce Willis uh Sam Jackson and
3060160	3069040	that guy the the star of split uh just uh they spend the whole movie in a hospital
3069040	3075040	run by the woman that you get if Joan Cusack isn't available and uh
3078400	3083040	and I'm like I'm like if this movie if this if they just have a fight in this movie's parking
3083040	3089200	lot I'm gonna shit my pants and sure enough they fucking the whole movie it's like the breakfast
3089200	3094320	club that movie like they're just like in a hospital for an hour and a half and then they
3094320	3102000	fight in the parking lot it is so goofy it is the goofiest movie I've ever seen no not really
3102000	3108160	I've seen goofier movies surely I don't know I can't name any offhand my brain is swiss cheese
3108160	3114160	but it was just such a goofy movie there are these there's like there's like uh is it a comedy uh
3114160	3119840	no I mean not not not not not on purpose yeah it wasn't trying to be funny I mean there was
3119840	3123600	probably a moment or two when I was like oh and then this will be funny I didn't notice that but
3123680	3130080	but it was just like uh it's just such a are these in theaters or where are these from now
3130080	3136160	this is uh you can you can watch this now on their street services based on your description

3259200	3264640	episodes that could be maybe she subscribed to the patreon but dude he went off on this thing
3264640	3269200	wasn't actually called it's not called asperger it's called cold case murder mysteries murder
3269200	3278080	mysteries uh I want to say his name is Ryan Kraus it is okay I mean he's like first of all he did
3278080	3282080	I I don't know if he did it recently or if it was just there and I didn't know it but he did
3282160	3291440	he did my the the uh kanika powell uh uh mystery like which is that that young lady that I talked
3291440	3296240	about who uh you know when we had the red-handed girls on and I was saying like I don't understand
3296240	3302080	why uh why this thing you know it's just like so crazy that she was you know these more than one
3302080	3307360	guy was like trying to kill her what did he just do but he he really like laid it to rest for me
3307360	3315040	what did he say he he he pinned it on this like guy that was active at that time before going to
3315040	3322640	jail and he was like a sloppy pseudo serial killer who did run with a gang who kind of like had
3322640	3329120	people doing his bidding and he was a ups guy that was like he was he frequently used friends to do
3329120	3333520	like these hold-up jobs where they'd pretend to deliver a package and then go to the thing and
3333600	3337760	like all the stuff and he was doing like rapes and murders weren't beyond weren't weren't beyond him
3337760	3345520	and um he he he ended up in prison sometime after this happened but he was just like it's that guy
3345520	3349600	and he didn't get caught for that and then he went to prison for other shit and he's in prison now
3349600	3354720	and I was like oh that makes me feel better yeah because because it just seemed like and it and
3354720	3359120	also it was like the thing the key thing about it was that the thing that was scary to me was that
3360080	3363920	the end of the story is that she comes home from doing her errands and whoever was
3363920	3370320	trying to get into her apartment all of a sudden shoots her in her apartment buildings vestibule
3370320	3378080	and just runs away but it's like oh no but he this is a person that's really stupid and that
3378080	3383920	spent weeks trying to get into her apartment and it was is like very clear from the behaviors he
3384000	3389760	kind of laid it out he's like you know this person wanted in her apartment and used all the dumbest
3389760	3396160	ways to try to get into her apartment and then out of absolute frustration just like waited there
3396160	3402320	and probably pulled a gun on her as she came home and she was military and savvy and was no way she
3402320	3407200	was going to comply and and then there was a struggle or something and just she started
3407200	3412000	screaming and he couldn't control the situation so he shot her so she couldn't be a witness and ran
3412000	3416240	off and that's why it was like but that that's the thing that was really freaking me out because it
3416240	3423040	made it's like well if it wasn't about assaulting her and it wasn't about robbing her it was like
3423040	3428880	like this this whole thing was a coordinated attempt to kill one woman and no one's investigating it
3428880	3434720	and but it was like nah it was a sloppy it was just it was it was the same kind of criminal that
3434720	3440480	we're all in danger of all the time like just i was able to file it now thank you asperger detective
3440480	3447040	he's great he is it normal for for the true crime stuff for a guy to have just like a really
3447040	3452240	concrete laid out theory that he supports with several you know i don't know i mean he's like
3452240	3456320	columbo that's what's cool about it is because like i don't really like true crime necessary i
3456320	3460240	mean i don't hate it or whatever i just don't engage in a lot but like he's just like you know
3460240	3465360	he's like here's the crime and here's why this person did it who's who's not proven guilty but
3465360	3470160	i'm just going out on a limb and saying i believe in it and it's just crazy because it's like i don't
3470160	3473920	know if he's right or whatever and sometimes you don't know if he's right but other times it's just
3473920	3478640	like oh man this guy's just like they should give him a medal or something definitely look
3478640	3482800	these people up but you know i don't think a lot of them you know anyway it's just very interesting
3482800	3487120	then he also does these like little little things once in a while and like you said sometimes he
3487120	3493440	does it badly aggravatingly or mysteriously but then then boy i heard a couple where he was like
3494000	3501600	nailing it and one of them was like the kessie kessie last name kessie i think that was like this
3501600	3506560	this woman who stabbed her kids and then tried to pretend like someone came in her house and did it
3506560	3513920	and um and he just at the end of his uh at the end of some of his episodes he just goes
3514720	3521360	and that's about it and that's why she stabbed her two children but the reason why she did that
3521920	3528960	is because of the same reason we do anything right because she's afraid afraid of dying
3529680	3535600	afraid of being alone she can't stand the idea that her few stolen moments on this planet
3535600	3542000	are precursors to an infinity of darkness after gaining only a brief glimpse of temporary fleeting
3542000	3549440	light she's worried she's a sentient mammal like the rest of us she doesn't know should she lose
3549440	3554080	weight should she gain weight is she doing it wrong did she get the right car he'll do like these
3554080	3561680	crazy like george carlin meets buckowski like fucking henry miller like uh monologues that
3561680	3568400	aren't really that forced he's like really like i'm like go aspie beat poet like he he he he
3568400	3576480	really he really he really does it right asperger detective um i i almost woke cody up i'm like he
3576480	3581840	gotta you gotta rewind and listen to this guy he's like laying it down really laid it down so
3581840	3587680	you have a dan you have a ghillie suit at your house currently right now is it like in the closet
3587680	3594000	is it on the floor is it in a case like where is it currently existing right now well it's
3594000	3599840	probably just strewn about the bedroom because when cody saw me in it you know no it's like laying
3599840	3607440	did you have sniper sex did you do a sniper sex no i uh it's probably laying on the uh living room
3607440	3613440	coffee table right and you've worn it you've you've strode about in it you've been outside
3613440	3617600	in it and you've you've communed with the coyotes no i haven't i'm not used to he doesn't have the
3617600	3623600	ladder yet no you've got to get that ladder yeah you you went for the ghillie suit before you got
3623680	3630560	ladder ghillie suit came first i don't know why i got a ladder if you want to borrow it i actually
3630560	3636640	didn't order mine yet oh shit it's kind of bluffing them coyotes that's probably good
3636640	3641520	can we do a show where you come out in the ghillie suit yeah i mean maybe
3644000	3648400	but i guess a proper ghillie suit you'd have to dress up like the dynasty typewriter you'd have
3648400	3652320	to wear like mahogany and have a candle on your head and stuff like that like you'd want to
3652320	3658320	camouflage yourself based on your surroundings yeah i mean right like a big armoire
3661440	3664880	but who cares you know oh dan wore something
3667200	3674480	stupid i've been this this asperger detector has been blowing my mind because like you said he does
3674480	3679520	these wrapping up things that are like about themes and stuff and it's like it's been like
3679520	3684800	church or something it's made me realize i was like oh man i'm afraid to ask for things
3685760	3691360	and i'm like i gotta ask for stuff more and i've been analyzing my life oh man it feels good there
3691360	3695760	was something that he did a little bit where i was i got a little inspiration from it too i wonder
3695760	3702480	if it was the same thing ask for what spencer ask for stuff like for instance like stuff you need
3702480	3708400	you know how people are like oh let me ask for help or ask for stuff i don't do that i was thinking
3708400	3714800	about it it was it's one of the things that drives my self-hatred you know um there's a
3714800	3722320	there's a podcast called i think small town dicks um i'm interested my favorite billy joe song
3722960	3728880	it's a it's a real pro one it's uh yardley smith is that the uh lisa simpson yeah uh
3730080	3738080	i think it's pronounced yardley no i don't know yeah uh and uh um uh her friend and then they have
3738160	3744480	these two detectives and uh it's really well done it's like a higher end true crime podcast well
3744480	3753840	produced and um but uh they had an episode where yardley uh told these stories about her as a
3754880	3761920	victim um and there were like a couple of them and then there was one for dessert that was like
3761920	3768080	just insane it was like the the the behavior of the person trying to victimize her was insane but
3768080	3776160	then it was almost it was almost the profound thing about it was how how insane she felt as
3776160	3781040	a victim like how she she just she's describing this crazy behavior on the part of this guy that
3781040	3786000	was doing work on her house and she started running all this like crazy shit on her and um
3786000	3789680	and you know it's fun it's like like i i have i feel like i've noticed it's like if you could
3789680	3799600	picture uh yardley uh uh smith as a as an actor she she um she was she was she wasn't always just
3799600	3805840	the voice of of lisa simpson like she's she's she's she appears in tv shows and stuff and she was
3806560	3814080	uh having kind of a heyday in the 90s and she's she's a very small like kind of adorable sort of
3814080	3820800	like like unassuming like everything about her face kind of kind of transmits this sort of like
3820800	3829760	uh uh like i don't know unassuming or something energy something like it and it's interesting
3829760	3835840	because i've heard from from women before like like women there's certain kinds of like women
3835840	3842320	who are like like like i i have this like kind of thing about me where guys like they smell
3842320	3848560	something on me and they're like coming after me because they're like it's like like i have this
3848560	3852080	like victim target on my head or something she didn't say anything like that but it was like
3852720	3856160	it occurred to me while listening to these stories i was like i like i bet it's not just
3856160	3862080	because she's famous but like it is because it's because like there's certain people that like
3862080	3868080	they just um i i think like like predators are just like oh yeah i don't i don't know if it's
3868080	3872160	like they they if they know it's easy prey because it's like it's also it's guys like stalking like
3872160	3878000	falling in love not just like oh she's an easy target it's more like oh i'm in love i'm in love
3878000	3883280	yeah i'm just walking with certain people and then like people just yell at them like and it's like
3883280	3887840	i've never experienced this in my life but it's just like people seek them out and like are
3887840	3892960	comfortable throwing shit at them for whatever reason i i don't know if it's a like yeah like a
3892960	3899680	predator sense or something um yeah and i kind of like it was like like this uh actor is telling
3899680	3905200	this story about this just absolute batshit psycho guy that's like doing work on her house and he's
3905200	3911920	like ramping up the uh the stuff and she keeps she keeps talking about these these these crazy
3911920	3916320	points where you're listening to the story and and her friend is listening to the story and saying
3916320	3921040	like okay so that at this point like you did you think about telling anybody about this like
3921040	3927360	crazy thing that was happening to you and uh and and she always had this reason why
3927360	3932640	no no not at that time or thing she wasn't being dodgy about it but it kind of built to this moment
3932640	3938560	where she she i mean she's been through this and figured this all out by now this is decades ago
3938560	3946000	but it was like she the reason she came to la to be an actor as this tiny person that that that
3946000	3950000	you know isn't necessarily she didn't look like ferra faucet she was like i'm gonna go eat the
3950000	3954960	world because i'm entitled to it because of my stature or my whatever it's like there's this
3954960	3960960	like the culture of her family and her psychology in her head was like i gotta own my ambition and
3960960	3965040	i'm gonna go out there and i'm gonna do this thing and then it's like a very healthy thing
3965040	3970240	like oh own your dreams and visualize your success and all that stuff and that uh but it
3970240	3975680	comes with this other thing that she's she's getting victimized by these like crazy stalker
3975680	3982160	guys and she's not telling anybody like and it's it's like so far beyond points like red flags where
3982160	3988240	where you know she like anyone else might have gotten killed you just don't know and then but
3988240	3991760	and then she kind of got she got choked up toward the end because she finally got to a point with
3991760	3998160	this guy where she simply this guy came over to her house that was doing work and he explained
3998160	4004080	to her that he had just killed two people for her uh because they had been following her and he was
4004080	4008480	like laying this whole thing on her and i need 25 000 dollars or just this crazy like weird
4008480	4014880	psycho shakedown and uh and then she just kept letting it go she still didn't go to anybody
4014880	4020560	and then she describes the moment where she finally she just runs out of her house and she
4020560	4027680	goes and calls this guy that worked at the studio the foxlot probably for um for help
4027680	4032800	and she starts like breaking while she's telling the story because that's that's the thing that
4032800	4039840	got to her was that she finally had to explain to this guy like this is what's been going on
4040720	4045680	and i like like and you could see her in her voice it's like like like oh this is the moment
4045680	4051040	of my weakness where i have to tell somebody that i let this get this far and then i finally need
4051040	4058160	help with it or something and it was just such an interesting that that that that other side of uh
4058720	4065360	of confidence and ambition and autonomy like you could be you you might be without knowing it like
4066160	4072800	pathologically incapable of of of telling somebody you need help um and i thought i
4072800	4076480	what i wondered that's what i meant i was like i was like jeez i wonder if i'm that way
4076480	4082480	now if something goes wrong in my life if i can smear it all over everyone i find that i i can
4082480	4088000	ask people for things that in a workplace context but outside of that i have a very rough time like
4088000	4092480	burdening my friends with a request or like i always feel like it's burning but it's just like
4092480	4096640	hey you want to get a sandwich it's like not you know it's not trying to take anything but
4096640	4104320	it feels weird to me but it might be a similar thing who knows yeah sorry no there was nothing
4104320	4109520	i thought i just i just i couldn't believe that story i was i was really taken by it she's like
4109520	4118720	like this uh she she seems like such a um such a remarkable character i like because she's like
4118720	4124480	i really like that podcast because they're very they're very like um kind of dug down into the
4124480	4128960	into their little true crime stories and it's it feels it feels less uh ghoulish because they're
4128960	4133440	talking to detectives so they're the detectives walking them through little cases that they have
4133440	4141520	uh a lot of victim blaming a lot of parent blaming like that there there was like uh
4141520	4147840	like uh there was there was this like uh sex crime thing what the fuck was it it was like
4149840	4155360	i just remember one of the detectives explaining this made this put me off having kids forever
4155360	4159840	i'm not doing it anymore like i haven't told cody i made the permanent decision but he was
4159840	4165760	like he was like look your kid's got an iphone you need to go through that thing or whatever
4165760	4171600	they're up to it's on you i was like i'm not going through my kid's phone if they're like and you
4171600	4176560	can't keep your kid from having a phone they're like like like you're like until the kid's 18 and
4176560	4181520	they're living with you it's your responsibility as a parent modern parenting you you got to go
4181520	4186240	through their phone and make sure that they're you know you got to check up on them that's that
4186240	4191120	there's a whole thing happening they go all these stories about kids that end up doing all
4191120	4196160	this fucked up shit or falling into these fucked up worlds like it's all on their phone and and
4196160	4201920	that that's the that's the same thing as their bedroom um uh if you know in the in the 60s and
4201920	4206080	like you gotta you gotta it's not their diary it's like you gotta go through i'm like i'm
4206080	4211360	listening to this advice i'm like if that's true and i guess maybe it technically is like like
4211360	4216000	because god knows no one else is gonna raise your kid for you but then i'm like okay so i'm
4216080	4222960	not having a kid for sure but i could go through a 12 year old's shit or be the only dad that
4222960	4227680	doesn't let a 12 year old have whatever the fuck everyone else has you know do you think the ship
4227680	4232160	is sailed for you in terms of children like for good i don't know you know these you know these
4232160	4240720	tadpoles are still dancing as in ted dude i i learned that the hard way i mean cody it's
4241280	4247120	it's all up to cody like i mean it's not up i mean it's like it's it's it's driven by her she's
4247120	4252480	she's she's in her prime she's she's in her creative prime she's in her biological prime
4253520	4257760	i'll i'll do i'll i'll probably do whatever she wants that's not true i mean i'm like if i
4258560	4264000	seized with like no i definitely don't want kids and then she was like it's time i might be like
4264960	4272640	uh i don't know i have to gaslight her somehow is there a book on how to gaslight
4274000	4277760	no i don't know i don't know we're sorry we're really up in the air we've been we've just been
4277760	4285200	having is is that a uh an imperative for her or no she's not we're not yeah she's not she
4285760	4292560	we don't we're undecided and like she had she had a little period where she was like
4293280	4297760	should i freeze my eggs she talked to the therapist about it and the therapist was like look
4298400	4306720	if freezing your eggs is like a ritual you need to engage in that lets you own your life uh then by
4306720	4311760	all means freeze your eggs but if you can skip the egg freezing and just and just do the like
4311760	4317280	just stop identifying yourself by you know it's like that kind of thing like like like don't you
4317280	4323120	shouldn't be this shouldn't be running your life that's crazy the therapist probably didn't say
4323120	4328080	that's crazy um but but and then cody was like okay i'm gonna freeze my eggs i told this story
4328080	4332160	and then she like looked at the information she's like step one don't get high for six months and
4332160	4341280	she's like nope well you were okay well eventually you're gonna okay deal breaker yeah uh but i don't
4341280	4349680	know i ran we ran into a friend and she uh she's in her 40s and she uh she has a podcast about trying
4349680	4356880	to do uh inseminate herself there's a couple of those podcasts out there now um people that are
4356880	4362560	going through the process of trying to conceive and sharing the the details of it and stuff

4476720	4482240	one hour of that before before i'm like in charge of whether or not people feel good or bad about
4482240	4488480	themselves i like i hate people i've lost a lot of faith in in the species but i don't feel like
4488480	4494240	it's a bad thing i feel like my faith was uh unhealthy it was like uh codependence or something
4494240	4500080	it was like you know approval addiction or something it's like yeah people are people suck
4500960	4505680	like they're they're shitty they're not all shitty and they're not none of them are all
4505680	4511040	shitty as individuals and and certainly not all people are shitty there's a there's lots and lots
4511040	4517760	of better ones and all the stuff but it's just in general so like you know bacteria you know
4517760	4524480	just they're just garbage the internet is just it's just it's it i still struggle now with like
4525120	4531360	oh is it is it like like like like i feel like my latest insight is like because i i posted this
4531360	4537200	instagram like where it was like the you know the photo of the black hole and uh you know what i
4537200	4541680	thought was a reasonably i thought it was a funny joke like i like uh take on the thing it was like
4541680	4548160	the photo of the black hole and i did this like caption where i was like uh oh it was it was a
4548160	4553360	headline that said like meet the woman that uh took the photo of the black hole and i and i so
4553360	4560400	i did this caption that was like okay well uh i saw this headline uh after i wrote my rotten tomatoes
4560400	4567120	review of of the black hole and then did this kind of like review of the black hole where it was very
4567120	4574720	clear that like i was uh trying to take something away from from the black hole as if it was created
4574720	4580720	by a woman um and uh it was just it was just like i like i like you know it was like like
4580720	4586000	i thought it was a well-crafted like but not like beyond anyone's like reckoning kind of thing
4586000	4590480	and i remember like at the end of it i was like the what i was like i was i was like hover over
4590480	4594960	the click button i'm like okay what does anybody gonna misunderstand and i remember going like well
4594960	4598880	you say the word wheelchair at the end that'll probably trigger a couple people and that's okay
4598880	4603920	because i i said like by by the way but bottom line is this black hole is basically just a
4603920	4609920	collapsed star uh that uh could have been predicted by uh almost any guy in a wheelchair or something
4609920	4614880	like that it was like uh like uh you said wheelchair and you might get a couple like ablest
4615600	4619760	comments and that's fine and then it clicked send and there was like i looked back at it and i'm
4619760	4625200	like holy shit it was like it was like like a petri dish and it was crazy it was like 10 percent
4625200	4633440	of 300 000 people just just just in all sincerity just going like yeah but just because she's a woman
4633440	4639360	doesn't make the black hole any less valuable like like in true sincerity i i read that one and i
4639360	4643600	predicted before i looked at any comments that you're gonna get rumbled on that and then and then the
4643600	4649200	other 10 are arguing with them and going like no he's right this is fucking bullshit like identity
4649200	4656480	politics i'm like like like so just like dumb people it was it was actually like a out of all
4656480	4661120	the things i've ever done that have been that misunderstood by that many people like i was kind
4661120	4664640	of like i regret that one the least because it really is this like moment of clarity where i'm
4664640	4671200	like you can kind of like see like it felt like equal equal equal number equal people on two lobes
4671200	4677520	there were just like people that saw concepts that made them want to leap to the defense of
4677520	4684480	something with good intentions and people that hated those people is it like well all just like
4684480	4690080	people not exercising any amount of critical thinking really right because there's absolutely
4690080	4696640	no way i mean what at what point did you that's when i started thinking about it i was like okay
4696640	4702320	so are people getting dumber or like and i pictured like okay let's go to the roman coliseum
4703040	4708000	and like i think that what's happening i think the part of what the internet is doing is is this
4708000	4713200	so imagine being at the roman coliseum and there's no there's no technology beyond like you're just
4713200	4718160	you're just in a crowd of people that's the that's the biggest internetiest crowd you could be in is
4718160	4722960	just a bunch of people at the coliseum and then someone comes out and they think they're going
4722960	4727760	to try to do a little bit you know like they and they like maybe something about their bit it's not
4727840	4735760	they didn't think it through i had i i i wrote on the the vmas in 2006 and this writer matt murray
4735760	4740800	was like uh he's like you know you're being too nuanced with some of this stuff like i wrote i
4740800	4747360	wrote on the jimmy fallon vmas and like what i learned is that these kinds of audiences can
4747360	4753200	express themselves in one of two ways they can they can scream or they can be quiet um and and
4753200	4758160	so it's like like so you're imagining like like the bandwidth being lowered so you don't have a
4758160	4762160	comment you don't have you know everyone doesn't have like this qwerty keyboard in front of them
4762160	4767440	and and also but they're connected to each other so think about all the times you've ever been in
4767440	4773200	public and you've been watching something like at a carnival or something and like it probably it's
4773200	4776400	probably a hard thing to remember because it probably doesn't stick out that much in your
4776400	4780080	memory because it's but but you can what you can probably remember is that this happens now and
4780080	4784720	then you just probably can't like conjure up a list of the times you've seen it but you're at
4784720	4791360	a live performance and something something goes wrong something something goes wrong between the
4791360	4797440	performer and the audience the uh the either it's either it's the performer's fault then they
4797440	4802480	didn't they didn't realize like how the venue how the timing of it was going to work or it's just
4802480	4807920	simply like it's a matter of opinion on your part of whether or not the who there's anyone's fault
4807920	4813120	but like you have memories in your head of like a disconnect happening where somebody in the
4813120	4822320	audience might might go like like oh boo like like because they're responding at the wrong time to the
4822320	4833520	wrong concept and it but then like that person traditionally um they get they they get they get
4833520	4838560	swallowed up either by silence or there's like there's a group of people around them that are
4838560	4843760	like off with his head no no and then but then they'll overhear people going like it's a bit it's
4843760	4849200	a bit it's a bit like like in real time and it'll just kind of like wash out that that's like
4849200	4855200	usually we're biologically designed for that to be a much more organic process yeah people pop off
4856160	4859440	and they want to be special and they want to they want to contribute to things
4859920	4865680	but we're designed biologically to do that in an environment where it just like stabilizes itself
4865680	4871680	so quickly and which allows you to not have put your ass out there that's the problem i think
4871680	4877040	is that by the time people are telling you these days that you're a fucking idiot that which
4877040	4881520	happens to the best of us some shit goes over your head sometimes you're just looking at stuff the
4881520	4886400	wrong way the wrong angle coffee cup the wrong nutrients in your breakfast like wrong wrong
4886400	4893440	timing some performers fought sometimes too like uh like like like but by the time someone is
4893440	4898400	telling you uh you didn't get it it's over your head you don't have a sense of humor you didn't
4898400	4905040	you didn't get it you have written a fucking essay about about how no captain crunch should
4905040	4911040	never be cloned uh cloning is unethical like there is no captain crunch that's a serial character
4911040	4918800	and you're like your tendency is therefore going to be to really well yeah still though
4918800	4923840	there are considerations lately whereas normally the what you're designed to be able to do is just
4923840	4928400	go like like you're only you only have just a little bit of a yay or a boo coming out of your
4928400	4934880	mouth before you feel that humiliation kick in you don't have this kite that you've flown
4934880	4940640	that's been designed and and and and all this energy put into it and i think that's and on one
4940640	4946960	hand i think that that's like a way of of looking at it positively and saying like look we're no
4946960	4953120	different we're not changing that much we're just the just the medium it just just it just it just
4953120	4957680	shines different lights in different parts of our general the same amount of stupidity that we've
4957680	4963440	always had but a really scary way of looking at it is that yeah but that's that's a feedback loop
4963520	4969680	that is that's a memory you store now it's different than going to a magic show and the
4969680	4976080	lady's sawn a little bit in half and you're like call 911 and and like someone goes like it's it's
4976080	4982560	magic and and you're like that's a different story you have in your head and you file that
4982560	4986720	differently and affects your complete your your neurological map completely differently
4987360	4997200	than i think then if you write a a paragraph uh you know advocating and defending and like
4997200	5005440	accusing and and and hashtagging and and then someone is like wow you read that wrong um and
5005440	5012560	i don't i don't know if that it's like it worries me that that that's going to make the that that
5012640	5016560	sock off balance it makes the dryer scoot all the way across the basement floor
5017360	5023440	do you millennials still have socks basements and dryers probably they probably they figured out
5023440	5027840	how to make dryers not scoot across are we living in a post sock milling a world right now
5028400	5033040	they probably have like like like contextually aware like dryers now that are like there's only
5033040	5042560	one sock in here i will i will group swarm uh i will tag uh three other dryers on the block
5042560	5051920	and receive dry sock information from them i want i want to i want to hear more from
5051920	5058480	millennial dryer isn't it interesting uh i think it was a ted talk i heard when somebody was like
5059360	5063280	this is interesting this guy like like oh this is the ted talk i want to give it's
5063280	5071920	certainly just doom saying uh somebody explaining that um we can't uh we're not going to stop
5071920	5077520	technology like we keep we i know we know that in general but we keep the fact that we keep
5077520	5082800	thinking of it like oh if something goes too far we'll stop it or if something goes into a dangerous
5082800	5086400	area they were talking they were talking about like the smart devices the fact that if you get
5086400	5091200	a new refrigerator now it's it's a good chance it'll be like wi-fi capable for no reason
5091840	5097440	that some yahoo just of course they put they made your refrigerator like able to log onto the
5097440	5103280	internet and like check on your juice or like like it's it's it always starts as some gimmick
5103280	5108560	you know because oh what if that sells an extra refrigerator but it's like it it's never gonna
5108560	5114000	stop there is no way you can't opt out of this stuff it is i don't know why i find that interesting
5114000	5119440	i guess i just find it like awful i guess we're we're in the end of the show because i'm just
5119440	5126960	drunk and babbling nonsense i i i travel so much and then i have this thing where like i'll buy
5126960	5132800	some food and then i have to go on the road and i'll put everything in the freezer and now i just
5132800	5138000	got nothing but shit in the freezer i just have a million loaves of bread in the freezer that i just
5138000	5143280	i that that's i i what kind of bread we're just gonna we're just gonna we're just gonna we're just
5143280	5149920	two old men on a bus stop bench we're like we're like we're like a mammoth duck variations we're
5149920	5156240	just gonna like i want the bike the bike is nice i don't know you never wore a red rider wagon
5157920	5163200	i don't know uh refrigerators are a bummer then you go you buy some bananas and you're like i
5163200	5167680	gotta leave town and and you put the bananas in the freezer because you don't want them to be
5167680	5171760	rotting and then you just got some frozen ass bananas in there and they're black and they
5173360	5177920	yeah i mean i haven't bought i haven't i haven't stepped foot in a grocery store since
5179680	5186480	since uh teddy roosevelt yeah and whenever it was it was just like for a party or something
5186480	5190800	weird like it was some scavenger hunt or something it wasn't like what was the last time you went to
5190800	5201280	movie theater hmm i think i fell asleep during a piece of shit uh george cluny uh hitler stealing
5201280	5208240	art movie uh the the monument the monument man monuments man monuments yeah i went to that uh
5208240	5213520	it was it was being erin mcgathy uh wow that was a while i got that kind of but no because i felt
5213520	5219120	cody and i saw deadpool together uh i went to the the vista theater which i love and i went there to
5219120	5226240	go see uh dunkerque and i'd had a couple drinks and i fell asleep like immediately and then woke
5226240	5232960	up like about 20 minutes in going like i'm just a drunk guy asleep in a movie theater out of matinee
5232960	5237520	and i got up and i left and then i came back the next day sober and then i liked the movie it was
5237520	5242720	a good movie yeah you ever go to the theater in like old town pasadena where you you you get the
5242720	5247840	armchair oh yeah with the sleep you get the car tail and pretzels don't don't don't feed me and
5247840	5252080	get me drunk during a movie i'm gonna fucking fall asleep yeah no that's what i did monuments
5252080	5257840	men baby i was probably i was probably snoring i mean i can't imagine they give you a blanket
5257840	5262160	don't give me a blanket when gene wilder died maybe maybe i spoken about this before when gene
5262160	5267120	wilder passed away uh the arc light in hollywood showed a bunch of gene wilder films and church
5267120	5272400	and i went and saw blazing saddles and it was awesomely people that were over 40 and people
5272480	5280640	that were like under 30 i can't imagine and people under 30 uh the people over 40 were
5280640	5284640	dying laughing because we've all seen the movie a million times we can karaoke the whole thing
5284640	5290800	and the the youngsters were a little uncomfortable yeah with because there's 11 n-bombs in the first
5290800	5297760	reel yeah and nobody knew where to fucking put it and i i thought it was made the movie even funnier
5297760	5305360	that people were being bummed out at blazing saddles well i mean if you repeated that process
5305360	5310320	today i think you'd find the people over 40 would would already the times have changed so fast that
5310320	5317840	nobody would be laughing in there right i guess i don't know it's uh it's good that things are
5317840	5322880	changing by the way what sometimes i search my head for that stuff i'm like like like what is
5322880	5329680	that like that reaction you have when you hear another thing about like well so-and-so's uh once
5329680	5334320	from now on you they should call this thing that thing and then you like you always have that i
5334320	5340480	always have that thing use my i statements i i i i always have that like thing or i'm like god for
5340480	5346800	crying out loud when's it gonna stop and they're like all right well never it's never gonna stop
5346800	5351920	yeah like and it's like it's kind of it's it's freaking me out now that i'm 46 because i'm
5351920	5360480	realizing like i'm like oh shit they're coming for me and like it doesn't matter how woke i get today
5360480	5366960	tomorrow next week like i'm walt disney at this point like i've done my crimes my steamboat willies
5366960	5373600	on the internet like i can't get it off i like i am problematic i've been problematic for the first
5373600	5378640	40 years of my life and the older i get the more problematic it's gonna be there's a whole
5378640	5384000	other generation coming if i'm lucky enough to make it to 70 there's gonna be uh 20 year olds
5384000	5388640	that are gonna make you guys roll your eyes that are gonna be like this guy's hitler like like
5388640	5393680	watching my fucking shitty like doing doing the improv shows that we do with who's live uh
5394320	5399040	like there's a bit that we do where we uh we bring a woman out of the audience and we ask her about
5399040	5406240	her life and i sing a song to her and i used to make it way more kind of flirtatious and romantic
5406240	5414560	and and we did a show in madison wisconsin on the day of the kavanagh confirmation and on the uh
5414560	5419440	the capital steps uh in madison have i said this before have we spoken i think you i think you
5419440	5424640	told this story that you've that you that you you checked yourself and before your rigidity
5424800	5429280	well we we got a review that day we're standing out there and hearing all these stories and
5429280	5433680	everybody got up and got a microphone and told their stories about all the shit that they've
5433680	5439360	gone through and it was pretty heavy and then i had to go do an improv show and it's five white
5439360	5445440	guys on stage uh doing a show the day that fucking kavanagh was confirmed and it was a
5445440	5452240	trickery day for a lot of people and we got a review from a woman who just fucking hated us
5452320	5456400	and i dig it because that was a bad day for women kind and for lots of people
5457440	5463920	but i've had to voluntarily adjust the way that i approached that one improv game
5464960	5470720	because it's like it's like everything is just in for all the good reasons and for every possible
5470720	5478400	reason things have shifted into a way that like what used to be hilarious is not in in the way
5478400	5485440	that it used to be even just a few months ago uh and there's ways to do it and still be funny
5485440	5493120	but without doing the other thing yeah before i got me too'd uh you got like me three didn't you
5493840	5500560	i think i got me one and a half but uh um even before that like on the you know when the when
5500560	5506960	the wine steam uh kind of like water table uh did whatever water tables do i don't know i'm not an
5506960	5512320	article um but um but i remember like kind of like okay all right now let's examine ourselves
5512320	5517440	let's be aware of what's going on and i remember running in my through my head for like the first
5517440	5522480	time in my life i was just sort of in june i was like whether it's on stage at the workplace
5523360	5528480	with strangers anybody it was kind of like because it started with me going like okay
5528480	5534960	what about that what about that relationship um and and stumbling upon the idea of like
5534960	5540560	well were you were you did it matter was it like oh doing all this negotiation in my head
5540560	5545840	and then i was like uh something made me go well why don't you look at it this way what what what
5545840	5552560	if it was uh this guy that you had the same set of circumstances with like swapped out the woman
5552560	5558640	in my head for a guy and then was like whoa like like like all of a sudden was like wait no i would
5559280	5564320	the guy would have been like what are you doing stop or if people were just been like what
5564320	5570320	what's with you or i would have been like what's with myself and then kind of like blossoming out
5570320	5576000	in my head going like oh god every dunkin donuts cashier anybody like like in any time because
5576000	5580320	there's a lot of stuff that like also part of growing up don't you don't you feel like you
5580320	5586640	came of an age where you were like actually a lot of it was like absolutely not anything but like
5587280	5596960	learning to be uh actually kind and uh um charming or funny or you know what i mean like like part
5596960	5602960	of being a man like and becoming confident it was and you get you get it was involved
5602960	5608000	like sexualizing like i don't mean sexualizing like the activity i mean like gender wise but
5608000	5614080	like like kind of like like getting like like sort of like acknowledging the differences between you
5614080	5622320	and the person you're talking to it was like it it was like the equivalent of like learning to
5622320	5630160	use a flathead screwdriver like you were graduating from fisher price to sears tools and it felt
5630160	5636960	benevolent it didn't it felt the opposite of predatory it felt gracious and chivalrous and
5636960	5644000	charming and all this stuff and but then you look back on it and you go okay but now these kids
5644160	5650240	are ready for like whether that was right or wrong or doesn't really matter
5651440	5656720	now the kids are ready they're like okay but let's wipe that clean like don't talk to anybody
5659040	5666480	in a way that acknowledges like anything that you perceive with your eyeballs period like just see
5666480	5674960	them as a fucking like tennis ball on a stick and like um get ready for you know be AI compatible
5674960	5679840	in your dealings and you will that then you don't have to worry about it you'll you talk about what
5679840	5685440	scares you talk about what you know and don't all of those areas are problem areas and i think that
5685440	5689520	is what's frustrating for people is they're like oh what so i can never do this i can never do that
5689520	5694480	like yeah you can't it's like yeah it's frustrating it is like a bunch of stuff that you did last week
5694480	5698800	like it's not on the table anymore and it's frustrating and embarrassing and i do and i do
5698800	5704640	think that like the the problem that the perpetuating cycle thing is that the people don't they don't
5704640	5710640	understand that the idea of correcting people or or hoping that people get better it shouldn't
5710640	5717040	be such a gleeful activity because that's you're not you're not going to make any new converts
5717040	5721520	like there it's like there that's exactly their nightmare so the only way that you learn
5722480	5727280	that you that that that that it's it's sex worker instead of prostitute now there's no
5727280	5732480	Hogwarts for that you know there if you're 48 years old you you could be the best person in
5732480	5736960	the world if i went back through all of all of harm and town there's a thousand things i would
5736960	5740480	take back and not not have said again because they're not they weren't funny then and they
5740480	5744880	wouldn't be funny now like it's it's like there's so many there's a couple things i said on whose
5744880	5750560	line that aired on tv that i would oh no i'd never fucking say that again because it's like
5750560	5755920	it doesn't i don't think it was funny then but but i was allowed to get away with it then well
5755920	5760400	that's what i'm saying and that's why it's almost like karma because it's like how how how much glee
5760400	5768000	have we taken when we were 18 and 25 like the idea that uh oh there was some time long ago when
5768000	5775440	that you could scroll back in the microfiche and like ah clean x had a racist ad like and we felt
5775440	5781920	superior but i'd be like ah ha like like like i caught you you know when you would dig that stuff
5781920	5787280	up it was just like more of a difficult thing to do and it was more profound back then i was like
5787280	5795840	but we it and then that makes me shudder now because it's like oh you're you're next like you're
5796560	5802800	you're frigid air you're disney you're you're just you're an institution if you're lucky
5802800	5808000	remember disney you walked on main street and there was a they're gone now there was curtains
5808000	5813680	had swastikas on them but i think it was swastikas in the old like like native american thing where
5813680	5819040	it wasn't like a like uh like that's sure yeah that's an old symbol but they were there i
5819040	5824720	remember if you fucking see a fucking swastika curtain up in the main street that's wild man
5826240	5831520	do you remember how mr toad's wild ride would take you through alsace lorraine uh
5833760	5839920	yeah you you you had to go invade the sedate and land and uh and and annex the alsace lorraine
5840960	5844080	fucking mr toad's wild ride i don't know if you guys have ever fucking been on this thing it's
5844080	5854000	great because it's a story of a bunch of animals uh led by a toad and there's ratty and there's
5854000	5860880	whatever the famoli and whatnot and you go and you start at a bar then you go get some pie and then
5860960	5867920	you go to hell because it's about it's about drunk driving oh yeah you go to jail then you
5867920	5872240	get hit by you escape jail you get hit by a train you die you go to hell and then it's the end of
5872240	5878080	the ride and i think it's just it's just a cautionary tale about being british
5881920	5886800	also we we went on there was fucking freezing it's the coldest i've ever been in los angeles
5886800	5892480	or orange county it was just dead cold outside we went on mr toad's wild ride a bunch and uh
5892480	5896800	because it's one of the rides that doesn't have cameras inside so we all had flasks of booze
5897440	5901520	so when you go inside and you get in the car and you go inside you could just drink on it
5902480	5910400	and uh then at the end you go to hell there's heat lamps and this guy that was running the ride
5910400	5917840	he's like you guys have been on this ride like 12 times like what is going on i go it's warm in
5917840	5925200	hell and he goes genius it's like we're only here for the drinking and the and the heat lamp in hell
5926800	5932400	you know it sucks fucking submarines now that it's finding nemo boo yeah to the oh to the oh

5989440	5994720	and you have the fucking first thing you get mario lopez and he's talking to you about aquaman
5995440	6007520	10 minutes of the crab people you know and so on yeah yeah yeah what is it about uh water that uh
6007520	6017280	is uh dumb is it just because we left it like we're like oh that's so dumb like uh little mermaid
6018240	6022960	got out of there yeah but at the price of what losing her voice yeah i know but we're like
6022960	6027200	don't i don't want to want we don't want to watch a movie like they i don't like that she's like
6027200	6032160	here's my spongebob here's my here's my beef with fucking spongebob movie is pretty good
6032160	6039520	oh yeah uh the little mermaid she knows the word trove but she doesn't know the word street
6040960	6046960	like walking around what do you call it again oh street but she knows trove yeah like a treasure
6046960	6051040	trove yeah fucking like what was so it's a weird she doesn't know what she doesn't know they're
6051040	6056080	called feet that doesn't track yeah it's stupid wait what do you why not a street a street is a
6056080	6061760	terrestrial cultural thing yeah but the trove is like a trove is there's fucking troves underwater
6061760	6066720	that she's very familiar with it it's like nothing to her you get a trove in your quinceanera when
6066720	6073120	you're a mermaid they're like here's your trove here's your fucking uh coconut bra or whatever
6073120	6079280	your seashell get bra uh it's flipping your fins you don't get too far come on if you check out
6079280	6085280	she knows dancing she did i do do mermaids dance and they don't know the word street i'm not gonna
6085280	6093760	i'm not gonna let you uh revisit the little mermaid thank god i just think that's a weird
6093760	6101600	thing she also very conveniently the two words that she doesn't remember rhyme street street
6102160	6108240	listen listen to what you've been way to go and andrew lloyd whoever fucking wrote that
6109760	6116320	andrew lloyd webber what that's that's he down that's a good fish joke because his
6116320	6122560	toes are webbed feet you know fucking like the swamp man you know you guys know about the swamp
6122560	6131040	man yeah he has webbed feet i have web feet you guys know that do you really i got two webbed
6131040	6139840	toes ladies i think i think church has got a web foot too hell yeah you know what they say
6141840	6146480	syndactically yeah that's what i got i got the second and two on each foot
6147920	6158080	yeah that's what i got twins oh hell yeah we can swim oh yeah do you guys know my times
6158080	6165280	the fly it probably doesn't really help with swimming right oh no like even if it was a little
6165280	6170720	bit like all olympic teams would have like all people with this yeah i mean swimming is like all
6170720	6175840	technique it's really hard but they like shave their arms and stuff i mean like every you know
6175840	6181600	you would think like like they're very conscious of like every little detail yeah so i would think
6181600	6187680	i would assume that if having like a webbed toe i think pinching your toes together approaches
6188160	6192320	the resistance of webbed toes church have you found that your webbed toes have given
6192320	6200720	you an advantage in the pool of course yes you don't have to say about guys with webbed feet
6200720	6205600	webbed hands yeah right is that what you're gonna say i was gonna say web dick but oh
6207520	6214560	web gloves web to dick i think all dicks are webbed all dicks are webbed it's true
6215200	6221600	it's like the spitting dinosaur from jurassic park it's like the frill that yeah
6224800	6225440	it's bad
6227680	6233840	nigel likes to go under the covers like habitually he likes to sleep like right on my thigh he likes
6233840	6240480	to go under the covers and he sleeps right here like where robocop's gun would be hell yeah but
6240480	6247840	then every once in a while i like i will part i will i will i will i will wake up with the
6247840	6257840	morning uh two messes and then i will i will i will i will pull down my me undies and kind of like
6257840	6268400	let let tim allen syndicate you gotta all right i'm not sure i follow that well it's a
6269040	6271680	that's because i coined it it's a new way of saying
6274720	6281120	i was quite proud of it but you know i just just you know you're all you're all bunched
6281120	6286560	up in your undies and then you got like the thing that i just i just like to my science of it is like

6292400	6297760	wear itself out maybe you know i just just like i think it's like a so it's like a self-fulfilling
6297760	6302240	prophecy if you're a guy you're sleeping in briefs and then this happens in the mornings and then
6302240	6307840	like the first thing that's happening to your wiener is it's like encountering resistance which
6307840	6313680	you're according to your wiener is like encouragement your wiener is like that's what i'm all about like
6314320	6319680	i want something to fight me like like that's that's that's what that's that's that's called
6319680	6324480	rubbing and it's like well no it's also called like you're you're misbehaving and you're in the
6324480	6332480	way and we're trying to sleep so i will i will just pull my my my undies down the like knee level
6332480	6339440	like and just just let it let it just let the let the flagpole like write it out yeah so that
6339440	6344960	it'll stop getting encouragement and it'll just it'll just feel itself like like it'll just amelia
