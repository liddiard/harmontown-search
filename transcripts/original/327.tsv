0	24000	Hey gang, sorry we were all late. How you doing all?
24000	34000	I'm downtown Los Angeles, Harmon Town. It's now in session. Bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
34000	48000	What up Spencer? I don't have a couch anymore. What happened? Yeah, where'd your couch go?
48000	58000	We negotiated this last episode. Well, for good measure, let's bring out the mayor of Harmon Town. You know him, you like him. Or maybe you don't. His name is Dan Harmon.
78000	86000	There's poop in my yellows pee.
86000	104000	We tried. There are 700 species of ant, undiscovered in the jungle, ready to rumble. Rainforest extinction, fucked your mama with grand distinction.
104000	115000	I opened her legs. What am I doing? Alright, that was great. I'll tell you what I'm doing. I got the streets in my blood. Oh yeah.
115000	123000	We were just saying at dinner that you had the streets in your blood. Streets in my blood. Cody thinks it's because I had a head injury.
124000	135000	I finally crossed a threshold. I wrapped in my sleep. I was freestyle rapping in my sleep. It's an amazing Instagram video because it's just pitch black because Cody's just grabbing her camera.
135000	150000	In the beginning you can hear me freestyle rapping gibberish. It starts in the distance and then gets closer because she's grabbing her phone. I'm really impressed with myself.
151000	170000	I think there's contention about whether or not it's because the streets are in my blood. That's my theory that I've been rapping so long that I'm now a real rapper and that's how we know because I rap in my sleep.
171000	180000	Cody thinks it's because that day I got drunk and I came home and I was being a fun dog dad and I was wrestling with the dogs in the front yard.
180000	189000	I'm doing my impression of what I think a man is supposed to be. After a while he's like, you know you're just rolling in their shit.
190000	198000	I rolled in their shit and so I was covered in shit and then I went inside and I was just very drunk and I took a shower.
198000	200000	Jeff is just learning this information.
200000	202000	And I fell in the shower.
202000	209000	You rolled physically in dog shit. Pull in his yard.
209000	210000	On purpose?
210000	223000	No, on purpose. I was trying to play with the dogs and be cool. I was trying to be like a Chris Pratt type of guy. Come on. Come on buster. Come on. I'm a man.
223000	238000	Mikkelob ultra. I come up with names for the lambs I'm going to eat later. Chris Pratt's Instagram is a lot. You learn the names of the food he's going to eat.
239000	247000	So you had dog poo on you because you're a horse playing with the dogs. So you took a shower and then you took a spill in the shower.
247000	255000	Yeah, my feet came out from under me and I just went straight back and it hit the back of my head on the wall of the shower. And I was just kind of laying there.
255000	259000	And then I went to sleep and then I started rapping.
259000	262000	Like in the shower unconscious?
263000	267000	Cody had the presence of mind to film this.
267000	272000	Well, when I started rapping, she grabbed her. She had strung in the shower.
272000	277000	She didn't call 911. She just started filming.
277000	283000	I think if the rap's good enough, then don't call 911, you know? Okay. Well, hear me. We can hear it.
283000	289000	With the bank where I was lit, you need to have fun. My name is Eggo Sicely. I was born in DC.
289000	291000	Wait, are you awake?
291000	292000	What?
292000	294000	What were you saying about the toilet paper?
294000	296000	I was rapping.
296000	298000	But why did you say you needed TP?
298000	300000	I caught early on ran out.
300000	301000	You what?
301000	306000	I caught everything out. My name is Freddie James III.
306000	308000	What?
308000	310000	This shit's fire.
311000	313000	What were you dreaming about?
313000	315000	Eat them.
315000	316000	What?
316000	317000	Eat them.
317000	318000	Meet them where?
318000	319000	Eat them.
319000	320000	Eat what?
320000	323000	Someone stops. Someone stops to eat some.
323000	324000	Who eats them?
324000	326000	Hungry.
327000	328000	Wait.
328000	330000	Ain't nobody with respect.
330000	331000	What do you mean?
331000	334000	Wait, ain't nobody like, oh, it's plastic man.
334000	335000	Plastic man?
335000	336000	No, you can't do that.
336000	338000	Who's plastic man?
338000	340000	You saw him last night.
340000	341000	See him?
341000	343000	You mad at him.
343000	345000	You have a concussion.
345000	347000	Yeah.
347000	351000	You should have been in a fucking hospital.
351000	356000	Well, I don't, I mean, if there's a cure for the mad science, I was dropping.
356000	357000	That shit's loud.
357000	362000	It doesn't sound like mad science. It sounds like God has Alzheimer's.
362000	365000	I said my name is Engel Slicily.
365000	368000	Engel Slicily.
368000	369000	Engel Slicily.
369000	370000	I don't know.
370000	372000	You should have been in the fucking hospital.
372000	373000	Well, I feel fine.
373000	374000	How's your head?
374000	375000	Did you cut yourself?
375000	377000	No, no, there was no blood.
377000	379000	It didn't really hurt.
379000	381000	Do you have a knot on your head?
381000	382000	No, there's nothing.
382000	383000	It didn't hurt?
383000	384000	I just kind of lucked out.
384000	386000	Did you land on your head, it sounded like?
386000	387000	Yeah.
387000	389000	I mean, I don't think I landed on your head.
389000	393000	I think I probably landed on my butt and smacked my head.
393000	394000	Yeah.
394000	399000	I feel like if I die, it'll be getting out of the shower or stairs.
399000	402000	Like I have big feet and stairs are way too small.
402000	406000	When I was a kid, I put like a sleeping bag over my head so I could like crawl
406000	408000	around like a worm, like night crawlers or whatever.
408000	409000	Right.
409000	413000	And I was crawling up the stairs and I slipped and fell backwards down the
413000	415000	stairs in a sleeping bag.
415000	420000	And man, I can remember the sound of my head hitting that tile.
420000	425000	And I echoed in my head and then around the room, you know, it was bad.
425000	432000	And, uh, I've been depressed since I think that is when everything changed.
432000	433000	That's your origin story.
433000	434000	Yeah.
434000	435000	Yeah.
435000	436000	That's your spider man, spider bite.
436000	437000	Yeah.
437000	438000	The next day I had a beard.
438000	439000	It was crazy.
439000	446000	And you had, you, you had multi-sided dice.
446000	450000	You used to be just like a weird, like a shitty Harvard stockbroker.
450000	451000	Yeah.
451000	453000	Like you, you, you were like a character from the boiler room.
453000	454000	Yeah.
454000	457000	But late night, so I played night crawler.
457000	458000	Yeah.
458000	460000	I got, I got jumped by a guy in San Diego.
460000	463000	Maybe I told the story before on the show.
463000	469000	I got like attacked by a dude and my head hits the pavement and I'll never
469000	471000	forget the sound of your head.
471000	472000	Bad sound.
472000	473000	A sidewalk.
473000	474000	It's a gross sound.
474000	475000	It sounds like dead.
475000	476000	Yeah.
476000	480000	No, it sounds like someone died, but you know, it's you making the sound in
480000	481000	that moment.
481000	482000	There was another crisis going on.
482000	486000	There was still a guy attacking me, but in my, in my head, I was like, oh, did
486000	490000	I just, are my brains all like going to fall out of my head?
490000	491000	Yeah.
491000	494000	You don't, you don't know what's happening other than the worst thing.
494000	495000	It doesn't sound like a crack.
495000	500000	It sounds like a crack and like, like a, like a Fisher and an end.
500000	501000	A break.
501000	502000	Yeah.
502000	503000	A break in life.
503000	504000	Yeah.
504000	505000	This is it.
505000	506760	I died on a pavement in San Diego.
506760	507760	That's how it sounded.
507760	508760	Yeah.
508760	509760	It's, it's sick.
509760	511360	I mean, it really, it makes me feel sick.
511360	513680	I actually will bar from it right now.
513680	519000	I know it sounds like because I had a cousin and I was like put in charge of
519000	523060	him when I was like eight and he was like four or something and he was going
523060	526280	through this phase where he would like throw tantrums and hit his head on
526280	529880	stuff until people wanted, but I was eight.
529880	533560	So it was like, can't don't kid a kid or like, like, but I was like, don't
533560	534560	kid.
534560	536760	I like took him, took him for a walk and we walked past a candy store and he
536760	543240	was like, can I get, I was like, you can't, I'm eight, I could buy you any
543240	544240	candy.
544240	547840	I'm fucking broke like you like, like, you know, like, like, we're fucking
547840	548840	kids together here.
548840	550160	I'm just bigger than you.
550160	551160	That's it.
551160	555120	Like, I ain't gonna money like, like, like, and then, and then he just like got
555120	558480	down on the sidewalk and started hitting his head on it and I was just like,
558480	559480	what?
559480	560480	Yeah.
560480	561480	I was like, okay.
561480	562480	How do you take, how do you, how do you parent?
563000	565560	My parents would just walk away whacking his head on the pavement.
565560	566560	Oh yeah.
566560	567560	Kids do that.
567560	568560	My little brother do that.
568560	569560	And I was, I was like, he's bluffing.
569560	570560	You got to call the bluff.
570560	572200	And I walked like a half a block and I looked back and he was still going
572200	576920	at it and like, I did talk to him when he was like 20 and I was like, are you
576920	579760	all right?
579760	580760	He's a firefighter.
580760	585320	I mean, we need those that worked out, but it's arguable that he wouldn't
585320	589280	have chosen that job if he, I mean, it's a dangerous job, right?
589280	591120	But maybe that's how firefighters get created.
591120	592120	That's a death wish.
592120	594640	They're like, yeah, they're like doing like, that's something incredibly
594640	595640	dangerous.
595640	599080	It's like, it's the face of pavement pounding of jobs.
599080	600080	Yeah.
600080	603600	Well, I, you're looking at it like that's just in his, in his, I'm saying like
603600	607400	maybe he, maybe he damaged the part of his brain that's like, you got to get
607400	608400	out of a burning building.
608400	609400	I, I think.
609400	613360	You're not supposed to go in, but we do need people to go in to put the
613360	614360	fires out.
614360	615360	A kid that does that and a person.
615360	616360	So you're welcome.
616360	619240	And a person that, a person that chooses that job is a person that's
619240	622080	okay with eternity.
622080	625920	Like he made his piece that day on the outside the candy store.
625920	626920	Yeah.
626920	629760	He's like, he's like, death means nothing to me.
629760	631760	If I had coddled him, he would have grown up to be like, what?
631760	635480	A candy thief or something or a candy store owner.
635480	637440	See, I am a candy thief.
637440	638440	Yeah.
638440	639440	You are.
639440	640440	Yeah.
640440	642640	I was fucking, I was doing a play in Whittier and me and Morgan
642640	647640	Muchnick, we're freshmen in high school and we're waiting for Morgan
647640	649440	Muchnick, what's his name?
649440	650840	It probably still is.
650840	655120	And we were, we're hanging out waiting for his mom to pick us up and
655120	658640	drive us back home to South Whittier.
658640	662480	And we leaned against the door of the liquor store and it opened.
662480	669560	So we fell into an open, empty, closed liquor store and we stole all the
669560	670560	candy.
670560	671560	Yeah.
671560	674560	Cause we had little like sports, like, like dance bags, like, like for our
674560	677280	leg warmers or whatever we fucking had, I don't know.
677280	680720	And we, it was leg warmers.
680720	685000	And we just took all the starbursts, all the skittles, all the, goddamn, all
685000	686000	of it.
686000	692000	And we look, I think we still a couple of nudie mags, like, like, like
692000	693000	tit mags.
693000	694720	We've got a couple of those.
694720	697000	And I said, the cash register is right here.
697000	701320	And Morgan Muchnick wisely said, I don't think we should do that.
701320	702320	Too real.
702320	703320	Yeah.
703320	704320	That puts it over the edge.
705080	706080	Yeah.
706080	709880	We're 15 years old, but still that, that puts it into like a, like burglary.
709880	710880	Yeah.
710880	716720	Uh, so we saw all the candy and we had a duffel bags filled with candy.
716720	720000	And for the next three weeks at high school, we were hot shit.
720000	724960	I was going to the cheerleaders like, Hey, was some starbursts up in this?
724960	725960	Okay.
725960	729600	We were drug dealers and we had like, some was like, how do you have all those
729600	730600	candy?
730600	732480	And we just pretended like we were rich.
732480	733480	Yeah.
733920	734920	All right.
734920	736920	We were just larceny.
736920	739040	I made another, I made another composition.
739040	742160	Oh, I'm excited about this.
742160	745000	They're all starting to sound the same kind of, but, uh, you're finding your
745000	746000	voice.
746000	747000	Well, maybe.
747000	748000	Yeah.
748000	749000	Well, so did George Harrison.
749000	751960	It sounds like another public domain thing, but I think I do have temp, temp
751960	754760	lyrics for it that I can present after I hear it again, but
763480	782840	yeah, wait, no, wait, wait, let's take a slide to it.
782840	785000	He has temp lyrics.
785000	787520	I got, I got, I have to remember the, hold on.
787520	788520	I thought, okay.
788520	789520	Yeah.
789520	791600	It's, it's like a, it's a one four or five kind of thing.
791600	795120	Let's do a voice to men style creation around it.
795120	797000	No, I was the worst.
797000	798080	It was good.
798080	799080	I liked it.
799080	800080	I had a fun time.
800080	801080	I know.
801080	802680	I feel like I'm going to forget it.
802680	803680	Like wall.
803680	806040	Um, I thought like, why wouldn't I, okay.
806040	807040	You're getting stage fright.
807040	811200	Well, I'm just, I feel like I'm going to forget the lyrics while I'm, uh, um, maybe
811200	812760	I, well, you know what I can do.
812760	813760	Don't think about the lyrics.
813760	816040	Just, just be, be there.
816040	818280	But you got to understand they're temporary lyrics.
818280	819280	Okay.
819280	820280	Right.
820280	825080	So like, I don't want any guff about like, oh, those lyrics aren't, they don't sound
825080	826080	very refined.
826080	832040	Wait, where's the, uh, so you guys know, but like Dan, he writes temp lyrics or he writes
832040	836280	temp dialogue and then he comes back later and actually like rewrites it good just to
836280	837280	get it.
837280	840680	So that's part of the process is, is temping stuff.
840680	841680	It's important.
841680	843480	Let me make sure this will play in the background.
843480	844480	No, it won't.
844480	845480	Wait, how come?
845480	846800	Oh man.
846800	851120	I thought garage being had a setting where you could, you could, he could have it play
851120	852120	in the background.
852120	854560	That's probably only the iPad version.
854560	855560	Oh yeah.
855560	856560	Okay.
856560	858480	Let me try to remember the lyrics, but they're temp.
858480	859480	Okay.
859480	860480	They're placeholder.
860480	862600	They have question marks all over them.
862600	867280	Welcome to harm in town.
867280	870640	Won't you lick my balls?
870640	873360	And after that we can have a little chat.
873360	876120	Well, mankind falls.
876120	882040	It's been said that we're all be dead with, wait, no, fuck I, I forgot, I'm liking, I'm
882040	883040	liking this.
883040	884040	You're really.
884040	885040	Yeah.
885040	886040	Yeah.
886040	887040	Harm in town.
887040	889640	Won't you lick my balls?
889640	892400	And after that we can have a little chat.
892400	895360	Well, mankind falls.
895360	901640	It's said that before we're dead, we'll see our species die.
901640	903760	Welcome to harm in town.
903760	905880	I'll try not to cry.
905880	906880	Something like that.
906880	907880	Yeah.
907880	908880	Okay.
908880	916840	I, I, I know, I know courtesy applause when I hear it, um, because I know you're here
916840	917840	for our guests.
917840	921000	Um, and, and, and so am I, uh, uh, they're a delight.
921000	923440	We have, we have flown them in fresh for you.
923440	928520	Like Maine lobster in a, in a, in a, in a chest of ice, uh, so that you can enjoy them
928520	929520	here in the desert.
929520	936040	They're, they're, they're, they're still chilled and, uh, uh, and still people.
936040	937040	Yeah.
937040	943400	Um, uh, they're, uh, in my opinion, I think they're the Goldilocks, uh, of, of true crime
943400	944400	podcasting.
944400	945520	It doesn't have to be your opinion.
945520	949880	I just, I think that, uh, it's been years since we had the, my favorite murder girls
949880	955640	on and those years for me have been filled with just endless true crime listening.
955640	960800	And, uh, Cody and I and Tahiti, we kind of like hit this point where we had run out of,
960800	965440	uh, of true crime podcasts, like the four or five that we were listening to kind of
965440	966440	binging.
966440	967440	They all ran out at the same time.
967440	972120	And so we listened to like probably what felt like hundreds and hundreds of different people
972120	977960	and just judging and sneering and, uh, bullying their speech impediments and whatever, you
977960	980160	know, just like bonding over that selection process.
980160	985360	And then we just found this, this, uh, these two British ladies, uh, uh, and, uh, and,
985360	990520	and, and I'm just so thrilled that they turned out to be, um, uh, willing to, to come out
990520	991840	here and talk to us.
991840	1006080	Uh, so please welcome our new friends, Hannah and Saruti from the Red Handed Podcast anywhere
1006080	1007080	you want.
1007080	1008080	Perfect.
1008080	1009080	Perfect.
1009080	1013440	I forgot the plugin.
1013440	1016800	Help yourself to some vodka at any point.
1016800	1017960	There's glasses over here.
1017960	1018960	Hello, Hannah.
1018960	1019960	Hello, Saruti.
1019960	1020960	Hello.
1020960	1023560	You guys, uh, you killed it in karaoke last night.
1023560	1024720	You're lying, but thank you.
1024720	1025720	No, you, you, you were great.
1025720	1026720	Thank you very much.
1026720	1027720	You were very good.
1027720	1028720	Oh yeah.
1028720	1031720	I'm, I'm, I'm the best.
1031720	1032720	You are.
1032720	1034360	Saruti laid down some fucking TLC.
1034360	1035360	Obviously.
1036120	1037120	Had to be done.
1037120	1038120	Had to be done.
1038120	1039120	Song that needs to be sung.
1039120	1040120	No scrubs.
1040120	1041120	Yeah.
1041120	1042120	No scrubs.
1042120	1045520	She, she has, you, you have a hard line against scrubs.
1045520	1046520	Yeah.
1046520	1047520	No scrubs.
1047520	1048520	No scrubs.
1048520	1049520	And then you did Peggy Lee.
1049520	1050520	I know.
1050520	1051520	I did.
1051520	1052520	Yeah.
1052520	1053520	I love Peggy.
1053520	1054520	She's a big, uh, I'm a huge fan.
1054520	1056520	And those are sort of quite a nice, easy one for karaoke.
1056520	1058800	I think it's pretty, pretty level.
1058800	1059800	Yeah.
1059800	1060800	It was very good.
1060800	1061800	Thank you.
1061800	1064360	And you guys hiked up to the, uh, Hollywood sign today.
1064360	1065360	Oh, huge mistake.
1065360	1066360	Yeah.
1066360	1069360	We hiked up to the summit of, um, Mount Hollywood by accident.
1069360	1072920	It really was, it's pretty bad yet.
1072920	1076920	And there's one true crime story associated with the Hollywood sign, Pig and Twistle,
1076920	1081320	hurled herself off of one of the letters when it was still Hollywood land, right?
1081320	1082320	Yeah.
1082320	1084800	I was, I was kind of like looking at Jeff.
1084800	1087120	I thought Jeff for some reason was like, I know Pig.
1087120	1088120	Who is that?
1088120	1089120	What's her, what's the person's name?
1089120	1092440	She was an actor 19, it was like 1930 something.
1092440	1094560	She jumped off the, I don't know.
1094560	1096200	Did she stand on the top of the actual letters?
1096200	1100720	If she didn't, it doesn't really count as jumping off the Hollywood side, but, uh, yeah.
1100720	1106800	I used to walk up there back in the day where, but before like there was a motion sensor
1106800	1112360	like security and you could hike up there and you could just hang out and have a drink
1112360	1116840	under the last O on Hollywood and it was very good.
1116840	1118920	And now if you go up there, you just get killed.
1118920	1119920	Oh yeah.
1119920	1121640	We saw her coyote in like a real one.
1121640	1122640	Yeah.
1122640	1127200	I've never seen one before in my daily aggressive fire displaced coyotes.
1127200	1129960	Welcome to the jungle girls.
1129960	1130960	They're so bold.
1130960	1135680	Now I keep seeing them this last year, I swear to God, when you drive your car by or something
1135680	1140640	or you come out by your car, like they'll come up to people like a, like a domesticated
1140640	1142880	dog, like happy to see people.
1142880	1147200	And it's like, this is, this is going to be bad because like, they're going to get hit
1147200	1149840	by cars or they're going to eat everyone's dogs or something.
1150200	1152720	If you yell at a coyote, they'll go away.
1152720	1155440	But what they're going to do is eat your neighbor's cat.
1155440	1156440	Right.
1156440	1157440	They will.
1157440	1158440	They will.
1158440	1159440	For real.
1159440	1163320	Like, like you'll, like if you live in Los Feliz or like near the park, you'll just hear
1163320	1165480	the sound of animals dying.
1165480	1169720	There's a family of my story right in that, like there's a bramble of things right on
1169720	1171280	the other side of that wall in my backyard.
1171280	1172280	Yeah.
1172280	1173280	That's a fuck it.
1173280	1176040	I actually need to talk to you about this because A, you're on the payroll.
1176040	1177040	Yeah.
1177040	1178040	This falls to you really.
1178040	1179040	Yeah.
1179240	1185520	And B, you're famous on this podcast for having like prepped a coyote fighting
1185520	1186520	method.
1186520	1187520	Oh, yeah.
1187520	1188520	I've been out there.
1188520	1190480	Come at me.
1190480	1191880	I do yell stuff at him now.
1191880	1196160	I like open my window and go, go like, like, yeah, fuck you.
1196160	1199240	And then they go like, fuck it off.
1199240	1200720	Like, I just like yell at him.
1200720	1203920	So Rudy and Hannah, did you see wildlife today?
1203920	1207400	We saw the one coyote, but as soon as we took our phones out, that was enough.
1207400	1208400	It ran away.
1208560	1212800	And we saw some signs about rattlesnakes, but no actual rattlesnakes, which is good
1212800	1214040	because she had sandals on.
1214040	1216160	It's cold, so they're hibernating right now.
1216160	1217160	But they're there.
1217160	1218160	They love it.
1218160	1219160	They're there.
1219160	1220160	Do they're hibernating?
1220160	1221160	Is that true?
1221160	1222160	Yeah.
1222160	1223160	Yeah.
1223160	1224560	What's the most dangerous non-human life form in London?
1224560	1225560	Theresa May.
1225560	1226560	That's fucking hilarious.
1226560	1236360	I wouldn't get Nigel Farage, but you might be right.
1236360	1241200	Is there like a, like, like, like here, I would say like within Los Angeles city limits,
1241200	1243760	like the brown recluse or something like that.
1243760	1248560	Like a spider that if it bites you, you could like necrotize and lose your foot.
1248560	1252880	Do you have anything in London that's like a creepy crawly that could like kill you,
1252880	1254520	hurt you, hospitalize you?
1254520	1255520	No.
1255520	1256520	You've got badgers.
1256520	1257520	They're not very nice.
1257520	1258520	Badgers?
1258520	1259520	Yeah.
1259520	1260520	They give you TB.
1260520	1262760	They've got TB and they don't stop fighting you until they hear your bones crack.
1262760	1264760	Oh, they've got TB.
1264760	1265760	They have TB.
1265960	1267280	They have TBs, badgers, TBs.
1267280	1269080	You have badgers that roam London?
1269080	1270080	Yeah.
1270080	1271080	We've got badgers, foxes.
1271080	1272080	The foxes are a bit more like...
1272080	1274400	I've seen the foxes in London.
1274400	1275400	Walking down the road in a fucking shortage.
1275400	1276400	Yeah.
1276400	1277400	They're like, we'll be home.
1277400	1278400	There's a fucking fox?
1278400	1279760	That takes balls to be a fox and walk through London.
1279760	1280760	Oh yeah.
1280760	1285960	That's like where they, I mean, like that's where they invented like the fox hunt.
1285960	1286960	Yeah.
1286960	1287960	Well, it's illegal now.
1287960	1288960	Yeah.
1288960	1289960	Yeah.
1289960	1290960	But I mean, still the foxes don't know that.
1290960	1294360	I mean, they're just like, it must be in their DNA that you're not supposed to go near like
1294360	1295360	Buckingham palace.
1296360	1297360	Okay.
1297360	1300360	So the queen rides out on her steed.
1300360	1303120	What do they call it?
1303120	1305360	What kind of horn do fox hunters blow?
1305360	1306360	A bugle.
1306360	1307360	Yeah.
1307360	1308360	Bugle?
1308360	1309360	Is it a bugle?
1309360	1310360	I think so.
1310360	1311360	Or the really long one.
1311360	1312360	I'm not sure if I know what the name is.
1312360	1313360	A flugelhorn.
1313360	1314360	A flugelhorn.
1314360	1315360	A flugelhorn.
1315360	1316360	We'll look into that.
1316360	1317360	Moving on.
1317360	1318360	Moving on to true crime.
1318360	1319360	Okay.
1319360	1320360	But yeah.
1320360	1326360	Well, so I did ask the Reddit, the subreddit, you know, do you guys have anything you'd
1326360	1329000	want to know from these ladies?
1329000	1336840	I would say like a large share of the questions circle around the theme of, is it traumatizing,
1336840	1339120	toxifying, anxiety inducing?
1339120	1344120	Is it fucking you up in any way to be constantly thinking about people getting murdered and
1344120	1345800	researching it and all that stuff?
1345800	1348360	And I mean, do you want to speak to that first?
1348360	1352120	I don't think we know yet what the damage is being done.
1352120	1354000	We'll find out in like maybe five years.
1354000	1358120	It's like Wi-Fi probably giving us herpes or something.
1358120	1359120	Exactly.
1359120	1360120	Whoa.
1360120	1363360	It's just like lying dormant right now with the damage we're doing to ourselves.
1363360	1366760	What was the impetus, like what brought you into that?
1366760	1369200	Into the world of true crime podcasting.
1369200	1371440	So we met at a party at Hannah's house.
1371440	1375400	We didn't know each other two years ago and kind of like what you and Cody were doing
1375400	1376400	down.
1376400	1381080	We just listened to other true crime podcasts and we were like, that's all right.
1381080	1384320	And then when we met, we were like, we could do this.
1384320	1385480	We should start a restaurant.
1385480	1387480	We should start a podcast.
1387480	1388480	Cupcake business.
1388480	1389480	Exactly.
1389480	1392520	And then I left that party thinking, I'll never see that coming.
1392520	1393520	Yeah.
1393520	1399960	But what's the allure for, because I think it's a lot of women listen to true crime
1399960	1400960	podcasts.
1400960	1404000	Is it because, well, what is the allure?
1404000	1407160	It's a prey, aren't we, so often.
1407160	1412120	And I think it's quite good to, I don't know, I think it's just, we're just morbidly fascinated.
1412120	1415360	Somebody left us a really negative review saying it's like you're morbidly fascinated
1415360	1416360	by it.
1416360	1417520	And we're like, yeah, we are.
1417520	1421800	There is kind of like, you know, there was, there was throughout the Reddit thread, like
1421800	1427560	there were people who delved into that question of like, you know, wanting to know about the
1427560	1432360	goolery of it all, if that's a word, but, and there was one, there was one post in particular
1432360	1434320	it was like all the way, like crazy.
1434320	1441640	How are you simultaneously like a Tyler Durden, the edgelord and anti true crime, like, ask
1441640	1446640	them how they can stomach being the perpetuators of whatever.
1446640	1452800	It was like, it was like somebody that was like really just wanted to shame the genre.
1452800	1456360	And I don't, I don't think it's a righteous genre at all.
1456360	1461000	I told you guys when we had dinner the other night, like, like among the many, like almost
1461000	1466880	innumerable variables that, that I like go to with in my head as a true crime listener,
1466880	1468800	you guys are just sort of at the sweet spot of all of them.
1468800	1476000	And that especially includes this spectrum between the kind of the goolery, like where
1476000	1482760	you're just like actually like into how bad things happen to good people.
1482760	1485640	And you're kind of like on the bad things side.
1485640	1489680	And then the other end of the spectrum is this, this compulsion that a lot of true crime
1489680	1493680	podcasts have, especially lately, where it's like they, you can tell they kind of feel
1493680	1497000	bad about what they're doing to the point where they, they're now kind of contorting
1497000	1500680	their language to make it seem like they're a public service.
1500680	1505000	Like this is about remembering the victims and stuff and I'm like, that's not a bad thing
1505000	1506000	or anything.
1506000	1510120	But like, really do we, do we, is it, would it be so bad if we were just, we were just
1510120	1515840	fascinated with horrible things like in this like unhealthy way that we were kind of fixated
1515840	1516840	on it?
1516840	1518440	Is that really such a bad thing?
1518440	1523280	Do you guys ever have conversations about that with yourselves about like, what are
1523280	1525480	we, is this a healthy thing we're doing?
1525480	1529400	Is this, is this unhealthy in a good way?
1529400	1530800	Is it healthy in a bad way?
1530800	1536840	Like what, like where do you put yourselves in relation to the, the, the karma of it all?
1536840	1541360	I think that for me personally, like I'm just fascinated with people.
1541360	1545760	And I think that's why true crime is so popular because I'm always quite wary of people who
1545760	1549280	describe killers as monsters.
1549280	1553640	I think that's quite dangerous language because you're separating them from yourself, but
1553640	1556960	actually you're just as capable as of doing that as that.
1556960	1560320	You have all of the same stuff that they do, really.
1560320	1562960	It's just a separate version of events that have led them to that point.
1562960	1567920	And that's what I think is interesting, but I know what you mean.
1567920	1574360	I think like it's important to not victim blame and give like name the victims and stuff
1574360	1579040	because I think it's quite easy to just like reel off a list of like a body count and not
1579040	1580520	identify them as people.
1580520	1581520	Yeah.
1581520	1585440	For my money, I just draw the, I don't, what I don't like to hear and I've never ever since
1585440	1590480	I was binge watching forensic files before there were true crime podcasts, I, I know
1590480	1595960	I always hated it when the implication, which was an implication that is kind of the bread
1595960	1601160	and butter of those old school true crime television shows, the implication that you
1601160	1606200	kind of deserve bad things to happen to you if you leave your television set, if you go
1606200	1610560	out into the world, like, like wrong place, wrong time, I've, I've ranted about that.
1610560	1614880	Like just that, that underlying religion of like, well, you shouldn't have gotten to that
1614880	1615920	trucker's cab.
1615920	1621280	Like I don't care how like risky the behavior is, like no one, I just personally for lazy
1621280	1625440	selfish reasons, I don't want to live in a world where anyone ever deserves anything
1625440	1629520	bad to happen to them because I feel like bad shit's going to happen to me and people
1629520	1635160	are going to, I just, I'm not like the brightest bulb in the drawer when it comes to like minimizing
1635160	1636160	risk.
1636160	1641440	So I like, I just, it's okay to say that was probably going to happen because you engaged
1641440	1646200	in that high risk behavior, but, but to the, there's some kind of line there where like
1646200	1650800	shows will imply almost that what did you expect?
1650800	1655000	You guys don't do that, but at the same time you're very much not, you're very funny and
1655000	1660600	profane and almost like, so I mean, you're, you're, you're, you're, you make jokes about
1660600	1664840	the, the, the, the, the victim's behavior.
1664840	1668680	One thing that comes to mind, like the, the, the girl who disappeared from the cruise ship
1668680	1669680	that episode.
1669680	1670680	Amy Bradley.
1670680	1671680	Yeah.
1671680	1676320	And you guys are sort of like, you're making like jokes about like, like who are these
1676320	1680920	people and like the kinds of reactions they're having to their, to their, their family member
1680920	1681920	going missing.
1681920	1687000	I remember just being like, like this skirts the line perfectly for me.
1687000	1691320	This is my taste exactly because you weren't like they're pieces of shit for having a bad
1691320	1692320	thing happen to them.
1692320	1696760	You were just sort of questioning their, their, their judgment in the aftermath, like what,
1696760	1700640	how the cruise ship is handling it and how they're handling it and all that stuff.
1700640	1702920	Like Dan, do you have a question?
1702920	1709120	No, I have a point to that though, because I would say that the reason, I mean, instinctively
1709120	1712560	we wouldn't be the kind of people that would victim blame it just feels grubby and it
1712560	1713560	feels wrong.
1713560	1717120	But also we're definitely, well, I'm definitely the kind of person that constantly puts myself
1717120	1719840	in situations in which I should probably end up being murdered.
1719840	1725760	If you literally want to hitchhike, I, you know, I do enjoy hitchhiking.
1725760	1733520	I've done it several times, but I know it was quite.
1733520	1738880	You like true crime because you're going to be a topic at some point.
1738880	1739880	I immerse yourself in it.
1739880	1740880	It's going to be your best episode.
1740880	1744280	The day I get murdered will be your best episode.
1744280	1751080	I have to say that for real, I got your name wrong.
1751080	1752840	You really hitchhike still.
1752840	1753840	I have hitchhiked.
1753840	1757920	Like, like some on the road, like standing on the road and not fun.
1757920	1758920	That's a bit old school.
1758920	1759920	It's a bit cliche.
1759920	1760920	It's Venmo now.
1760920	1761920	Exactly.
1761920	1764600	How do you, how do you moderate hitchhikers?
1764600	1768160	You stand there and then you wait until somebody comes up in a car and they're like, you're
1768160	1769160	going to be murdered.
1769160	1770160	I know.
1770160	1771160	That's what I'm saying.
1771160	1772160	She doesn't listen.
1772160	1775560	No, but I would say every time that I have hitchhiked, I have absolutely had to do it.
1775560	1780120	There's been no categorically false.
1780120	1781320	This is a runner on the show.
1781320	1782960	Saruti refuses to stop hitchhiking.
1782960	1787880	I picked up, I picked up, I picked up a couple hitchhikers in my life where I was certain
1787880	1790800	I was going to be murdered by the hitchhiker.
1790800	1796360	I got a hitchhiker one time and the guy left my car and he got out of the car and he said,
1796360	1800840	thank you, and he said to me, words I'll never forget, he said, don't take any wooden
1800840	1801840	pussy.
1801840	1802840	He's not wrong.
1802840	1803840	What does that mean?
1803840	1804840	He's not wrong.
1804840	1814800	I don't know what it means, but I've lived by that law for, you got to, since 1994 I've
1814800	1816400	never taken any wooden pussy.
1816400	1823280	I will say there is a disturbing undercurrent of like, oh, I'm preparing for the day that
1823280	1824440	this is going to happen to me.
1824440	1831640	We're women, we're the prey, because when I, Cody, when we're early on in our relationship,
1831640	1836200	I think I've bullied her out of expressing it or something, because you can see how much
1836200	1847000	it upsets me, but that concept of I'm prepared for the day I encounter one of these monsters.
1847000	1851480	I'm Cody saying, and she's confiding in me, so nobody judge her.
1851480	1859000	This is her talking to her fiancee and not knowing he's going to podcast it, but confiding
1859000	1862760	a feeling, when we're talking about what we get out of this genre, Cody confiding this
1862760	1867320	feeling that one of these days, one of these situations is going to happen to me and I'm
1867320	1869320	going to nail it.
1869320	1875960	Honestly, it makes me angry because I'm like, stop it, stop saying that, just be terrified
1875960	1877960	all the time.
1877960	1880360	Don't get cocky.
1880440	1882440	This is the worst feeling in the world.
1882440	1891160	Is that the thing for women that love True Crime podcasts or in your love of it?
1891160	1897880	If I walk into an elevator and a guy gets in the elevator with me, I'm not afraid.
1897880	1904280	If I walk through a parking garage, like a parking lot, and I hear footsteps behind me,
1904280	1909560	I don't think I'm going to get raped or murdered, but I think that's kind of the neutral setting
1909560	1910840	for all women, right?
1910840	1915720	Oh yes, like a perpetual state of danger on your toes.
1915720	1920520	So is that part of why you do what you do and why that's a fascination of the murder
1920520	1921520	thing?
1921520	1924440	Because murder is always an option every time you walk out the door.
1924440	1931800	No, no, for real, like women get killed all the time by their boyfriends when they go
1931800	1932800	jogging.
1932800	1933800	Definitely.
1933800	1937320	It's definitely true, but then I think like, yeah, I don't know if that is the impetus.
1937320	1939880	I feel like all women probably feel that way.
1939880	1943720	So they'd all be running True Crime podcasts, though, you know, sometimes it does feel like
1943720	1949560	everyone is, but I think it's more just, I've just always been interested in it.
1949560	1954280	I'm just the kind of person I like to go look for what is the most disturbing film, the
1954280	1955640	most disturbing book.
1955640	1959920	Like Dan Carlin from Hardcore History kind of comes back to the idea that people are
1959920	1963280	fascinated by the extremes of the human experiences.
1963280	1966360	I think the word he uses, it's like, that's why what war is.
1966400	1971320	It's like what drives a society to like throw people at other people until like one of them
1971320	1973040	explodes or something, you know.
1973040	1977200	And so it's like that is like it's so far afield from our normal lives that it's somehow
1977200	1978200	fascinating.
1978200	1980840	And like you said, it's like we all have the same DNA and stuff.
1980840	1986360	So it's like what separates us from these people that live this extreme version.
1986360	1987360	And that is fascinating.
1987360	1988360	Maybe.
1988360	1989360	Yeah, I think so.
1989360	1992960	And I think it's always we get feedback from people saying, oh, that episode was too gory
1992960	1997200	or too violent, but they are categorically our best performing episodes.
1997200	1998200	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
1998200	2002840	And some people like I will swear on the show, like not because we're trying to offend anyone.
2002840	2004680	It's just how I can talk.
2004680	2009120	So I think so people will say, I just can't I can't stand this swearing.
2009120	2012400	But I was like, OK, but like listening to a description of a body being cut up, you're
2012400	2013400	fine with.
2013400	2014400	Right.
2014400	2018040	It is weird to be what people's deal breakers turn out to be.
2018040	2019040	Yeah.
2019480	2022880	And you guys have such like grace and poise.
2022880	2026960	And maybe that's like maybe 40 percent of that is just Americans think all British people
2026960	2027960	have grace and poise.
2027960	2028960	But I'll take it.
2028960	2031880	But but but I mean, it's a it's an audio format.
2031880	2035720	So the accents are like a huge part of what's for sale.
2035720	2042520	I like listening to these voices and but you guys have this sort of confidence to you,
2042520	2046360	even though you're dealing with these really like gray areas, especially in this time when
2046360	2048160	I feel like I'll just speak for myself.
2048240	2053320	Like I feel like I feel like every time I open my mouth, I'm just in a minefield and
2053320	2058080	all I can do is just fuck up like as little as possible.
2058080	2064240	But so it's kind of nice listening to you guys like you're you're you're you're smart
2064240	2071760	and and and like you're here when when when the conversation sometimes goes into these
2071760	2078040	areas of like about society, about like culture, things that could be construed as possibly
2078040	2079600	politics.
2079600	2083960	Although I think it's a shame that that these things are called politics these days.
2083960	2087720	Things like the incel when we did when you did the Elliot Roger thing, I just it was
2087720	2093360	such a beautifully concise like I think it was you Saruti like kind of like ran down
2093360	2096440	just really quickly like what what is an incel?
2096440	2097440	What is the deal with this?
2097440	2106280	And like it was so it made me feel more in control of a of this quagmire just listening
2106280	2111400	to you guys like as eyes in like like talking about it.
2111400	2115480	I don't I again, I have no questions of a bad interview, but but but the Reddit people
2115480	2119320	have have have questions, some of which actually tickled me.
2119320	2121320	Oh, but thank you also.
2121320	2123600	Here's a huge service you provide.
2123600	2126520	I urge this is a call to action.
2126520	2130960	Like everyone has to stop endorsing the lie detector.
2130960	2134360	Like I love that every time there's a lie detector involved in an investigation, you
2134360	2139120	guys specifically stop and make a point of how lie detectors are horseshit and that no
2139120	2141560	one should ever consent to a lie detector test.
2141560	2144040	Like whether you're guilty, innocent, whatever.
2144040	2146900	The larger crime is lie detectors being taken seriously.
2146900	2154160	Everyone just refused them because they're just like the weird applause.
2154160	2156960	That was a weird applause break there.
2156960	2161240	I mean, I really like it's my I guess that that in the 911 call, I guess I do have this
2161240	2163960	like hang up about like what's the 911 call?
2163960	2169880	Well, just that idea of like everyone gets judged for their 911, oh, she sounds weird.
2169880	2171560	She sounds so robotic.
2171560	2172560	She's like a mannequin.
2172560	2173680	Like she must be guilty.
2173680	2178720	Like I just live in terror of is like I'm going to something's going to happen to Cody
2178720	2183080	and I'm going to like call 911 and people are going to listen forever to my 911 call.
2183080	2184080	It was so calm.
2184080	2188880	Yeah, I have a feeling that I do think that if something happened to one of you guys,
2188880	2189880	I might.
2189880	2193840	It was so weird that Dan during his 911 call about Cody, he just kept talking about Chevy
2193840	2198240	Chase like like why?
2198240	2199760	Why would he do that?
2199760	2204360	I don't like I don't like that because just like like because you could say you could
2204360	2208480	justify any narrative and it would make sense because people are fucking crazy and do all
2208480	2209720	sorts of crazy shit.
2209720	2210720	So like I don't know.
2210720	2213480	Was it Amanda Knox or whatever she did like flips or whatever and they're like, that's
2213480	2214480	what you do.
2214480	2215480	She was innocent.
2215480	2216480	It's like that's what you do is we're guilty.
2216480	2217760	It's like, yeah, both of those are true.
2217760	2220320	What I mean what we're just that's an idea you had.
2220320	2223200	Okay, that doesn't mean anything like a dingo baby lady.
2223200	2224200	Yeah, exactly.
2224200	2225200	Yeah.
2225200	2226200	Dingo baby.
2226200	2227200	What was it?
2227200	2228200	Cry in the dark?
2228200	2229200	Was it?
2229200	2230200	No.
2230200	2232360	So this lady and her baby got eaten by a dingo.
2232360	2233360	Yes.
2233360	2234360	No one believed her.
2234360	2235360	Is it Cry in the Dark?
2235360	2236360	What's the film called?
2236360	2237360	Oh, maybe.
2237360	2238360	Yeah.
2238360	2239360	And no one believed her because she was too sort of stoic.
2239360	2240360	Yeah.
2240360	2244880	And she just kept talking about how dingoes eat meat and it was like, yeah, stop saying
2244880	2245880	that.
2245880	2246880	A dingo took my baby.
2246880	2247880	Yeah, exactly.
2247880	2252240	And then she went to prison and then they found the baby skeleton in a dingo's nest.
2252280	2253280	Yeah.
2253280	2254280	So the picture happened.
2254280	2255280	A dingo baby.
2255280	2256280	But people didn't believe her reaction.
2256280	2257280	Right.
2257280	2258920	That's the thing is just because people are just putting weird narratives from their own
2258920	2260960	baggage on someone going through a crisis.
2260960	2263000	I mean, that's why Dan probably feels uncomfortable by it.
2263000	2264000	Yeah.
2264000	2265000	Because it's judgment.
2265000	2266000	Yeah, exactly.
2266000	2268360	It's particularly judgment about like how you're weird, how you talk weird, how you
2268360	2269800	act weird.
2269800	2270800	Let's do it.
2270800	2271800	Let's do it.
2271800	2272800	Someone did suggest to this on the Reddit.
2272800	2278600	They said, do a 911 role play exercise and I'm not sure how to do it, but because the
2278600	2282760	two things are like, if you're on nine, the two things you hear on every 911 caller,
2282760	2289040	if the person is like a neurotypical in their reaction, like in other words, they're like
2289040	2290040	screaming.
2290040	2291040	They're in hysterics.
2291040	2292040	Oh my God.
2292040	2293040	This horrible thing is happening.
2293040	2296280	What is the, what is the thing that the 911 operator immediately says?
2296280	2297840	I need you to calm down, ma'am.
2297840	2298920	I calm down.
2298920	2299920	I need a couple.
2299920	2306320	Like, like, it's so like, it's so predictable and I, it's like, why, why does she need to
2306320	2307600	calm down?
2307600	2310120	She's screaming, here's my address.
2310120	2312500	There's a headless body in my driveway.
2312500	2315360	It's okay for her to not be calm.
2315360	2317400	She's giving you every piece of it.
2317400	2321600	It's also okay for her to be way too calm because there's a shock factor.
2321600	2322600	Yeah.
2322600	2327200	But then when she does that, then she's a suspect, like, like it, it, it, God forbid
2327200	2328200	that they do.
2328200	2329200	All right.
2329200	2330200	So how do we do?
2330200	2331200	Do you want to?
2331200	2333440	Yeah, I don't know what to, what I don't know.
2333440	2334440	Who's going to be 911?
2334440	2336720	Jeff, someone should be 911 and then someone else.
2336720	2337720	I think we just go.
2337720	2338720	Okay.
2338720	2339720	Oh, wait.
2339720	2340720	Oh, let's do it this way.
2340720	2341720	Hmm.
2341720	2345360	Cause it's like, uh, why don't we make it like the game of werewolf where we, uh, secretly
2345360	2348640	pick one of us as is, is, is, is a murderer.
2348640	2349640	Okay.
2349640	2356660	And then we'll do a series of 911 calls, uh, and, and, and, and you guys will determine
2356660	2358000	which of us is the murderer.
2358000	2359000	That sounds great.
2359000	2360000	Let's do that.
2360000	2364280	I think, I think Spencer should be the, uh, the dispatch, like the 911 person.
2364280	2365280	Okay.
2365280	2366280	Okay.
2366840	2371400	So how do we, yeah, that's what I don't, we got to figure that part out.
2371400	2372400	Uh, okay.
2372400	2375760	Well, Dave Klein, my personal trainer, Dave Klein.
2375760	2377320	Can you come up here for a moment?
2377320	2378720	Dave Klein, everybody.
2378720	2381000	He's my personal trainer.
2381000	2383600	Dave Klein, Mimble is a mountain goat.
2383600	2385600	He laughed earlier.
2385600	2389760	I ran into him at the drawing room and, uh, he became my trainer.
2389760	2390760	What do you got, Giants?
2390760	2391760	What do you got?
2391760	2392760	Metz, baby.
2392760	2393760	Metz.
2393760	2394760	Oh, Jesus Christ.
2394760	2395760	Metz all day.
2395760	2401240	What I'm going to ask you to do is just, uh, we're going to close our eyes and then you're
2401240	2404960	going to tap one of us on the head and that person will be the murderer.
2404960	2410600	So, so, so all, all four of the, me, Hannah, so Richie and I, we all close our eyes.
2410600	2411600	Uh, yeah.
2411600	2416160	Cause I don't, I don't know how to exclude one of, you know, I don't have the heart to
2416160	2417160	do that.
2417160	2422400	So we're closing our eyes so that we don't know who Dave Klein is picking as the murderer.
2422400	2423400	No crimes.
2423400	2430400	Dave Klein's gonna, gonna, gonna, uh, touch them or somehow indicate to them that they're,
2430400	2431760	I'm going to walk around.
2431760	2433240	I'm going to walk around everybody.
2433240	2434240	So you can't tell.
2434240	2435240	Exactly.
2435240	2436240	Right.
2436240	2437240	It's like heads up seven.
2437240	2438240	Yeah.
2438240	2439240	All right.
2439240	2440240	Yeah.
2440240	2441240	Did people play that game?
2441240	2442240	Did people play four corners?
2442240	2444480	Does anyone remember four corners?
2444480	2447840	When I moved down here, no one played four corners and then people started playing it
2447840	2452000	and then everyone was playing and I was like, did I bring four corners down here and make
2452000	2455040	sure you exclude Spencer because he's going to be the dispatch.
2455040	2458080	I'm just closing my eyes to like sharing the group illusion.
2458080	2459080	Yeah.
2459080	2460080	That's, that's good.
2460080	2461080	Group illusion.
2461080	2462720	I might've invented four quarters down here though.
2462720	2464560	It was a Northern California thing.
2464560	2465960	There's four square.
2465960	2467480	You got a murderer on your hands.
2467480	2468480	Oh shit.
2468480	2469480	Okay.
2469480	2470480	I'm opening my eyes.
2470480	2471480	Okay.
2471480	2472480	So we're good.
2472480	2473480	We're good to go right now.
2473480	2474480	So how do, how do we start this?
2474480	2478400	Oh, if you were poked, just to be clear, if you were poked on the right side of your
2478400	2481360	rib cage, you're the murderer.
2482160	2483160	All right.
2483160	2484160	Okay.
2484160	2485160	Oh, play.
2485160	2486160	Oh, sorry.
2486160	2493080	How do we like, how do I think I get, who calls, who wants to go first?
2493080	2495560	I think I could start us off if we know who's going first.
2495560	2496560	Okay.
2496560	2499200	Well, should we get like a thumbnail of the murder though, so that we're all doing the
2499200	2501720	same, so that are the same crime?
2501720	2506680	Like we just need like, uh, like, uh, what, like, uh, cause a death or something.
2506680	2511840	Every spouse is, uh, is decapitated on the kitchen floor.
2511840	2513200	Okay.
2513200	2514200	It's fair.
2514200	2515200	And you're calling 911.
2515200	2517080	We have a decapitated spouse.
2517080	2521040	So if you murdered them, you decapitated them.
2521040	2526920	I think eventually the audience, I guess, I guess, I guess not you guys, cause maybe
2526920	2533640	Dave Klein can guess, uh, wait, I can guess because I didn't see, well, yeah, maybe this
2533640	2534640	is perfect.
2534640	2537320	Maybe I'm a genius.
2537320	2539480	I thought people would like me being smart.
2539480	2541160	Thank you for helping us.
2541160	2542160	Thanks for being nice to me.
2542160	2543760	I need it actually.
2543760	2544840	This is a collaborative effort.
2544840	2545840	We are making this up.
2545840	2546840	Okay.
2546840	2547840	All right.
2547840	2548840	All right.
2548840	2549840	So, uh, yeah.
2549840	2555160	And then the prospect here is that we're going to try to do the murder is going to try to
2555160	2556160	sound like a murder.
2556160	2560120	It doesn't make a lot of sense because it's like, they're all going to, we're all going
2560120	2564240	to be lying because we don't have a, it's a, it doesn't make any sense.
2564240	2565240	No, no, it's good.
2565240	2566240	Hold on.
2566240	2567240	Hold on.
2567240	2568240	Hold on.
2568240	2577040	I think the thing is, uh, let's say a police officer, first we, wait, I don't like this.
2577040	2584360	First we, we all make a nine 11 call a nine one one call or in England, isn't it just
2584360	2588920	Ollie Ollie Oxen free or what's the nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine.
2588920	2592280	That's got to result in a lot more false butt dials, right?
2592480	2594760	I think that's just a bunch of nine one one.
2594760	2596640	It goes through to nine nine nine because it's on TV.
2596640	2597640	So that's nice.
2597640	2598640	Oh, interesting.
2598640	2604080	So first, first everybody has to make a call saying that a crime has been committed and
2604080	2606960	they've seen it decapitated lady.
2606960	2607960	What don't you get?
2607960	2613840	And then, then I think Spencer, after you have been the dispatcher, I think you are
2613840	2616760	the lead detective and like the first 48 kind of guy.
2616760	2617760	Well, of course.
2617760	2618760	I mean, of course.
2618760	2619760	Yeah.
2619760	2623000	So everybody gets sat down and you have to make your first step.
2623000	2624000	We all get it.
2624000	2625000	Yeah.
2625000	2626000	Yeah.
2626000	2627000	What don't you get?
2627000	2628000	No, no.
2628000	2632280	The key to the key to this game is you, Hannah, your, your, your background is in theater,
2632280	2633280	right?
2633280	2634280	Yeah.
2634280	2635280	Yeah.
2635280	2636280	Yeah.
2636280	2641800	So Rudy, you're, you work in like, uh, PR or like, uh, like we're all entertainers here.
2641800	2647640	So those of us who aren't the murderers, we just need to be so fucking good in the moment.
2647640	2650080	Are you saying that you're not the murderer because you're the murderer?
2650080	2651080	Whoa.
2651080	2656120	We need to be so in the moment and good that we really do believe that we found a body.
2656120	2658200	This guy's talking like a murderer right now.
2658200	2659200	All right.
2659200	2660200	I'm just, I'm just.
2660200	2661200	Hold on.
2661200	2662200	Hold on.
2662200	2663200	911.
2663200	2664200	What's your emergency?
2664200	2665200	Who's going first?
2665200	2667200	I think this, this is going order.
2667200	2672960	Um, I, my wife is dead, sir.
2672960	2673960	Can you calm down?
2673960	2674960	Oh yeah.
2674960	2675960	I don't know.
2675960	2676960	There might be someone still in the house.
2676960	2677960	I don't know what she did.
2677960	2678960	She's dead on the floor.
2678960	2679960	Her head's detached.
2679960	2680960	She's dead.
2680960	2681960	She's been decapitated.
2681960	2682960	I'm in my house.
2682960	2683960	Are you safe?
2683960	2684960	I'm in, no, I'm not.
2684960	2685960	Who's safe?
2685960	2686960	Can you please calm down?
2686960	2687960	My wife is dead.
2687960	2689960	I need your address.
2689960	2696520	Uh, two, one, uh, one, seven, um, I'm making up numbers.
2696520	2697520	It sounds like you're making up numbers.
2697520	2703360	I almost gave you my real life address so I freaked out.
2703360	2704360	Sir.
2705360	2710360	9, 0, 0, 7, a, a, a, a, a golden tail drive.
2710360	2716360	I believe that may be my real address from when I lived in Milwaukee.
2716360	2717360	Okay.
2717360	2718360	We're sending.
2718360	2719360	We're sending peace now.
2719360	2720360	There's so much blood.
2720360	2721360	Just tell me what happened.
2721360	2722360	Please calm down.
2722360	2723360	Your head came away from her body.
2723360	2724360	I just came home.
2724360	2725360	I don't know.
2725360	2726360	There's blood everywhere.
2726360	2727360	Her head's on the floor.
2727360	2728360	Jesus Christ.
2728360	2729360	I'm getting out of the house.
2729360	2730360	Oh my God.
2730360	2731360	I'm getting out of the house.
2731360	2732360	I got to get out of the house.
2732360	2733360	I got to get out of the house.
2733360	2734360	There might be someone still here.
2734360	2736360	I think I'm going to throw up.
2736360	2737360	Sir, calm down.
2737360	2738360	Help!
2738360	2739360	Someone help!
2739360	2741360	My wife's got her head cut off!
2741360	2743360	I know that's not helping.
2743360	2744360	Ooh!
2744360	2745360	Okay.
2745360	2747360	The cops are here.
2747360	2748360	All right.
2748360	2749360	I'm going to hang up.
2749360	2750360	Their cops are here.
2750360	2751360	Calm down.
2751360	2754360	They're pointing their guns at me.
2754360	2756360	It's just a phone!
2756360	2763360	My character was African American.
2763360	2769360	I don't feel good.
2769360	2772360	Drop that phone.
2772360	2773360	Oh boy.
2773360	2774360	All right.
2774360	2775360	Round two.
2775360	2776360	Should we go again?
2776360	2777360	Yeah.
2777360	2778360	Yeah.
2778360	2779360	I'm ready.
2779360	2780360	9-1-1.
2780360	2781360	What's your emergency?
2781360	2782360	Hi.
2782360	2783360	You have to help me.
2783360	2784360	I've just got home.
2784360	2785360	Ma'am.
2785360	2789360	The bathroom door is closed and I can't open it.
2789360	2790360	Are you sure it's closed?
2790360	2791360	Yeah.
2791360	2792360	I can't open it.
2792360	2796360	I'm sure it physically opens, but I personally just can't open it.
2796360	2799360	This is not an emergency, is it?
2799360	2804360	No, there's blood coming out from under the door.
2804360	2805360	Oh, Jesus.
2805360	2806360	Yeah, I think it's my wife.
2806360	2807360	Oh, fuck.
2807360	2808360	Calm down.
2808360	2811360	I think it's my wife, but I don't know.
2811360	2812360	I can't open the door.
2812360	2814360	You need to send someone to come and open the door.
2814360	2815360	I'm terrified of door handles.
2815360	2816360	Okay.
2816360	2818360	Please just take deep breaths and tell me where you are.
2818360	2819360	I can't possibly.
2819360	2820360	I'm in my house.
2820360	2822360	That's why I've been asking you to calm down.
2822360	2825360	Blake, I just can't touch it with my hand.
2825360	2827360	Please send someone to open the door.
2827360	2828360	I think she's really in trouble.
2828360	2831360	I need to know where you live first.
2831360	2832360	England, London, the universe.
2832360	2833360	Now, can you slow down?
2833360	2834360	Hold on.
2835360	2836360	What?
2838360	2840360	I have my regular dress.
2840360	2841360	Please calm down.
2841360	2842360	We can edit that out.
2843360	2844360	London.
2845360	2846360	Oh, wow.
2846360	2847360	You said I'm sorry.
2847360	2849360	You said I should have called nine nine nine.
2856360	2857360	All right.
2857360	2858360	All right.
2858360	2859360	Sounds good.
2859360	2860360	I'll talk to you later.
2862360	2866360	Sound of the American paramedics coming by steamboat.
2866360	2873360	Like all the, all the boats are pulling over to the side of the Atlantic.
2873360	2874360	Is that the same crime?
2874360	2875360	Are we, are we still talking?
2875360	2878360	Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a spouse on the floor.
2878360	2882360	But hey, shout out to your fucking LGBTQ discriminate.
2882360	2883360	Yeah.
2883360	2884360	All right.
2884360	2885360	Yeah.
2885360	2886360	Okay.
2886360	2889360	And shout out to the dispatcher for not freaking out and going, your wife,
2889360	2890360	you're a lady.
2891360	2892360	All right.
2892360	2894360	Richie, you're on.
2895360	2896360	Okay.
2896360	2897360	911.
2897360	2898360	What's your emergency?
2899360	2904360	I just came home and it appears that my husband's been decapitated.
2905360	2906360	Ma'am, calm down.
2912360	2914360	No, I don't think you understand.
2914360	2917360	It's quite a situation we've got on our hands here.
2917360	2919360	I think you need to urgently send somebody.
2920360	2921360	No, I get you.
2921360	2924360	Now, if you could give me your address and please just remain calm.
2926360	2928360	I feel like I'm being calm, sir.
2928360	2930360	I don't appreciate you taking that tone with me.
2933360	2934360	Now I feel bad.
2937360	2939360	It's 911.
2941360	2942360	Fox street.
2944360	2946360	Now you're eerily calm.
2946360	2947360	Eerily?
2947360	2950360	That's your choosing adjectives there, sir.
2950360	2951360	You can't just...
2951360	2953360	I'm writing this in the police report.
2954360	2956360	I write police reports.
2957360	2959360	We're sending a dispatch now.
2959360	2960360	Just stay on the line.
2960360	2962360	Can you describe the scene for me?
2963360	2964360	I did.
2964360	2965360	My husband has been decapitated.
2965360	2966360	Right.
2966360	2967360	I wasn't paying attention.
2967360	2970360	It was just so unnerved by your calmness.
2970360	2973360	I would appreciate it if you stop saying such things because this is being recorded.
2973360	2976360	And I'm sure when I eventually go on trial for my husband's murder,
2976360	2979360	they will play a recording of this at my trial.
2979360	2982360	So stop biasing the jury.
2982360	2983360	Wrong number.
2983360	2984360	Click.
2985360	2986360	Wrong number.
2991360	2992360	All right.
2992360	2994360	Does Dave go or do I go?
2994360	2995360	I don't know.
2995360	2996360	I don't know.
2996360	2997360	Murderer?
2998360	2999360	Ask me an answer.
2999360	3000360	You said the murderer.
3000360	3001360	All right.
3001360	3003360	Dave like walks around and pokes himself.
3005360	3006360	Only the audience knows.
3007360	3008360	No, Jeff.
3008360	3009360	You know, you go.
3011360	3012360	9 1 1.
3012360	3013360	What's your emergency?
3013360	3016360	Hey, my name is Donnie.
3020360	3022360	I am a manager at
3023360	3025360	as borrows pizza.
3027360	3028360	This is 9 1 1.
3029360	3030360	Yeah.
3030360	3031360	Yeah.
3031360	3035360	A friend of mine that works here hasn't shown up for a couple of days.
3035360	3036360	And I'm worried about him.
3038360	3040360	I want to file a missing person report.
3040360	3042360	Sir, you'll need to calm down.
3043360	3045360	I'm just saying John is number one on time.
3045360	3046360	He's always here.
3046360	3049360	First one and the last one to leave.
3049360	3052360	And he's he's my favorite employee.
3052360	3053360	I just we've called him.
3053360	3058360	We've called his home and we've been to the house and just no replies.
3058360	3060360	I feel like something bad has happened.
3060360	3062360	Our lines are very important.
3062360	3063360	And this doesn't sound like an emergency.
3063360	3065360	I'm going to transfer you to police services.
3065360	3069360	But please, this is for imminent danger and people who are like on fire and such.
3069360	3070360	Okay.
3071360	3072360	I'm worried about you.
3072360	3073360	Yeah.
3073360	3074360	Thank thank you.
3074360	3075360	You know what?
3075360	3076360	Actually, what do you need?
3079360	3080360	Let's just talk about this.
3080360	3086360	I just want to find my my manager because I run a very successful borrows pizza at the
3086360	3090360	Chicago Midway Airport and the guy the guy hasn't showed up.
3090360	3091360	All right.
3091360	3092360	What was his name?
3092360	3093360	His name was Raul.
3093360	3095360	Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.
3095360	3098360	Well, it looks like he's live streaming on Instagram.
3098360	3099360	What?
3099360	3100360	Okay.
3100360	3101360	So that's good news.
3101360	3102360	Yeah.
3102360	3103360	Okay.
3103360	3104360	So he's alive.
3104360	3109360	Here's how you make a pizza.
3109360	3110360	What was that sound?
3110360	3115360	I'm going to check in my haunted closet.
3115360	3116360	I'm a Raul.
3116360	3120360	I'm moonlighting as a self-employed pizza maker.
3120360	3121360	Don't tell my boss.
3123360	3124360	You get this?
3124360	3125360	Oh my God.
3125360	3126360	Scary.
3128360	3129360	Sir, you'll need to call.
3129360	3131360	Oh, he's on the, he's on my phone.
3132360	3133360	Just Instagram.
3134360	3135360	I'm dying.
3135360	3136360	All right.
3136360	3143360	So now now I think we all have to go into our first meeting with like the lead detective.
3143360	3144360	Oh, really?
3144360	3146360	See, this is Jeff's idea.
3146360	3147360	Okay.
3147360	3148360	Yeah.
3148360	3149360	All right.
3149360	3150360	I'm not going to slow down.
3150360	3154360	I'm sure you've wondering why I've asked you all here.
3154360	3161360	Are we all to a dinner mystery about a crime in which you're all implicated?
3161360	3163360	Were we all married to the same?
3163360	3167360	Four identical murders to four identical doppelgangers.
3167360	3169360	It's all the same murder.
3169360	3171360	It's all the same murder.
3171360	3175360	And it's all the same murder.
3175360	3180360	It seems this event converged multiple universes and I'm here to find out why.
3181360	3185360	Now, why was everyone not calm or too calm?
3185360	3187360	Explain your logic.
3188360	3190360	I was just in a panic.
3190360	3195360	I was terrified first for my wife and then for myself.
3195360	3198360	I ran out the door and the cops shot me.
3201360	3202360	Wow.
3203360	3206360	I just I really can't do door handles.
3207360	3209360	A likely story.
3210360	3211360	What about knobs?
3212360	3215360	Knobs I can do, but I have to do them with my elbows.
3216360	3217360	Checks out.
3220360	3225360	And Saruti or whatever your character's name was, if it was different.
3226360	3229360	It wasn't stiff, stiff upper lip.
3230360	3232360	That's that's very suspicious.
3233360	3236360	I'm a professional and I know these things.
3237360	3238360	I'll move on.
3239360	3240360	I got an alibi.
3240360	3242360	I was teaching yoga in Los Feliz, baby.
3242360	3244360	I got 30 people that can tell you exactly what I was doing.
3244360	3247360	We went through a whole sun salutation situation.
3247360	3252360	Yeah, I had a lady let out a real loud, juicy fart during Savasana.
3252360	3253360	Everybody remembers it.
3253360	3254360	Well, this is kind of unrelated.
3254360	3258360	Actually, you're just here because you keep poking people in the side.
3259360	3262360	Look, I got real strict probation situation.
3262360	3263360	All right.
3263360	3268360	You got to poke three people every month or it's back at the big time.
3268360	3269360	That's right.
3269360	3270360	Checks out.
3270360	3271360	Thanks.
3271360	3272360	Jeff.
3272360	3273360	What the fuck?
3274360	3276360	I don't understand why I'm here.
3276360	3279360	I'd like to have a lawyer present before I answer any questions.
3279360	3280360	Right.
3280360	3281360	Actually, though, your friend just got killed by a ghost.
3281360	3282360	Right.
3282360	3283360	We saw it.
3283360	3284360	We caught it live on film.
3284360	3286360	I run a very successful pizza company.
3286360	3288360	A likely story.
3288360	3289360	All right.
3289360	3290360	Spencer.
3290360	3291360	I'd like to lawyer up.
3291360	3292360	I think it's the murderer.
3292360	3293360	I'm going to guess Jeff.
3293360	3296360	I think it's probably Saruti, but that seems too obvious.
3296360	3299360	Well, will the real murderer raise their hand?
3299360	3302360	Well, who should ask the audience?
3302360	3303360	They know.
3303360	3304360	Well, let's ask the audience.
3304360	3305360	Okay.
3305360	3306360	Everybody on the audience.
3306360	3307360	Guess on three.
3307360	3308360	Okay.
3308360	3309360	Is that cool?
3309360	3310360	Yeah.
3310360	3311360	Okay.
3311360	3312360	One, two, three.
3312360	3314360	I heard Spencer.
3314360	3317360	I didn't feel.
3317360	3319360	They saw, they saw you tap me.
3319360	3320360	Yeah.
3320360	3321360	I was the murderer.
3321360	3322360	I really thought it was.
3322360	3323360	You thought it was Saruti.
3323360	3326360	I'm a master of game theory.
3326360	3329360	You guys know about the Monty Hall problem.
3329360	3331360	The Monty Hall what?
3331360	3335360	I don't know who's enjoying this, but someone's going to love this show.
3335360	3336360	Here's a question.
3336360	3341360	I rather liked from the subreddit.
3341360	3342360	Little, little British talk.
3342360	3343360	Is that what you were laughing at?
3343360	3345360	Cause I said, I rather liked.
3345360	3346360	Isn't it just.
3346360	3348360	Isn't it just.
3348360	3351360	You're just saying cause I'm interrupting by continuing my bad
3351360	3352360	interviewing.
3352360	3353360	It should be a brother.
3353360	3354360	All right.
3354360	3355360	Come on.
3355360	3361360	My goal isn't to be British in it.
3361360	3362360	I like this question.
3362360	3364360	I rather liked this question.
3364360	3367360	Didn't I just.
3367360	3371360	Does anyone think that our generation being obsessed with true crime will
3371360	3373360	create better serial killers?
3373360	3376360	It's like we're all doing research on how to get away with murder.
3376360	3379360	Kind of a similar problem with antibiotics, right?
3379360	3381360	We're going to make a super bug.
3381360	3382360	I see.
3382360	3383360	I see.
3383360	3384360	I see.
3384360	3388360	I'm not sure whether true crime is a new fascination.
3388360	3391360	Like how, how long is America's most want to been on television?
3391360	3393360	But don't you think it's safe to say that?
3393360	3396360	Well, I mean, that's a dumb leading question.
3396360	3397360	I do.
3397360	3403360	Do you do, do we, or do we not think that more people are kind of
3403360	3406360	forensically savvy than let's say 20 years ago?
3406360	3407360	I think so.
3407360	3408360	We know what Luminol is.
3408360	3409360	We know.
3409360	3412360	So if you, so if you were going to like fly into a rage and like murder
3412360	3416360	somebody or kill them for insurance, like it's safe to say that you are
3416360	3418360	going to maybe take extra steps.
3418360	3421360	Being a serial killer would be a big step.
3421360	3423360	I don't think many people would be serial killers just because they think
3424360	3426360	they could get away with it better.
3426360	3427360	Right.
3427360	3429360	They're like, the market's good.
3429360	3431360	It's my time now.
3431360	3435360	I'm so well educated in this, but I think the average kind of killer who
3435360	3439360	like, you know, decapitates their spouse and then tries to call in, I think
3439360	3442360	they probably are going to be more sophisticated, but then law enforcement
3442360	3444360	is constantly getting more sophisticated.
3444360	3445360	Yeah.
3445360	3448360	And I think the pieces that people are better at understanding now like
3448360	3453360	Luminol or, you know, DNA and things like that, but there's so many
3453360	3455360	different parts to the investigation.
3455360	3458360	Like when we talked about like Chris Watts, the guy who killed his wife and
3458360	3462360	his kids, that's like a really recent case, the number of unbelievably
3462360	3466360	stupid things he does, like Googling things, making calls from his phone to
3466360	3469360	like figure out where he can dispose of his wife's body.
3469360	3472360	I'm like, what were you, what were you doing?
3472360	3475360	It just also seems like, and I think this is especially true in London,
3475360	3476360	right?
3476360	3479360	Like there's just cameras everywhere.
3479360	3481360	Like you can't not be on camera anymore.
3481360	3484360	I mean the most CCTV city in the world.
3484360	3485360	Yeah, it's true.
3485360	3489360	I think I don't know if this is true anymore, but at one point, certainly
3489360	3493360	I read that you're caught on CCTV about 300 times a day in London.
3493360	3494360	Right.
3494360	3498360	Although a lot of places in London, it's cheaper just to put a camera out in
3498360	3500360	front of your place and not plug it in.
3500360	3503360	Like just to look like you have a CCTV.
3503360	3504360	Yeah, absolutely.
3504360	3505360	That's really common.
3505360	3509360	Like blind spots in London and people know exactly where they are.
3509360	3513360	And if you're going to get into a fight or commit a crime, they know where the
3513360	3514360	cameras aren't plugged in.
3514360	3515360	Yeah.
3515360	3519360	I remember going to like an anarchist website probably 20 years ago now where
3519360	3524360	it was like you could plug two locations in London into a like a map and it
3524360	3527360	would show you the route where you could stay off camera.
3527360	3528360	Yeah.
3528360	3531360	Just for them, it was just a matter of principle, I guess.
3531360	3540360	I was at a casino in Reno, Nevada and a guy grabbed a friend of mine, this woman,
3540360	3543360	like grabbed her by the crotch like Trump style.
3543360	3547360	And because he's a horrible human being.
3547360	3548360	Right.
3548360	3553360	And I grabbed the guy and security came over and they go, if you want to kick
3553360	3558360	his ass, go to the parking lot and go to the right and stand by this one thing
3558360	3561360	because the cameras don't work there for a reason.
3561360	3562360	That's where the security goes.
3562360	3564360	That's where they go and they fuck people up.
3564360	3565360	Right.
3565360	3570360	If you're going to go deal with this guy, here's where you fucking go.
3570360	3574360	There's cameras, but those ones don't work for a reason because that's where shit
3574360	3575360	gets dealt with.
3575360	3580360	Do you think that true crime fans are more or less predisposed to like be wanting
3580360	3581360	to commit crimes, though?
3581360	3585360	Because I might believe like people with a bent for justice might be more prone
3585360	3586360	to do true crime.
3586360	3589360	So then maybe they're less likely to even do these kinds of crimes.
3589360	3592360	So then the kinds of people who like this stuff aren't the kinds of people who are
3592360	3594360	going to use it to get away from crimes.
3594360	3595360	I don't know.
3595360	3596360	Talking.
3596360	3597360	Talking.
3597360	3604360	Hey, guys, like, like I've read a bunch of like true crime stuff and fictional
3604360	3605360	crime stuff.
3605360	3611360	And what the police always say is smart people are the first ones to get caught
3611360	3614360	because they think that they know what they're doing.
3614360	3617360	And they and they also think that they can't get caught.
3617360	3623360	And also, because they're smart, when presented with evidence and logic,
3623360	3626360	they're they go, oh, you've got me.
3626360	3630360	Stupid people get away with it because stupid people don't see logic and they
3630360	3631360	just don't fucking care.
3631360	3632360	Well, did you go?
3632360	3637360	Well, here and here's where the the the Twain meet.
3637360	3639360	Is this name is Josh Powell?
3639360	3643360	Is that the the the Powell guy that I think he was Mormon.
3643360	3649360	By the way, Mormons, we got to talk like, like, like you're listening to true
3649360	3653360	crime. It's like, like, yeah, I will put a pin in that.
3653360	3659360	But the the the Powell guys, this is the guy who drove out to the drove out
3659360	3665360	somewhere, came back without his wife in Utah and then like forever they're
3665360	3671360	investigating him. And then he eventually he did the two kids.
3671360	3674360	He he killed them like and set his house on fire.
3674360	3675360	You guys know what I'm talking about?
3675360	3686360	Yeah, the cold podcast that that guy like he he he had seen a true crime case
3686360	3687360	like in Utah or something.
3687360	3692360	There was some comparable case that he was documented as having studied
3692360	3697360	basically. And the lesson that his not entirely bright mind but incredibly
3697360	3705360	sociopathic mind had learned was simply don't lie as like like like tell as few
3705360	3706360	lies as possible.
3706360	3712360	If you if you're going to invent a person, for instance, that like killed your
3712360	3718360	spouse in the alley, don't don't say you don't you didn't see their face.
3718360	3722360	Don't say you saw it and that they were Latino and they were wearing a fedora.
3722360	3726360	Like you're going to the more details you give, the more you're going to get
3726360	3727360	cornered and caught.
3727360	3732360	The guy was just it was it was like he was like it was childish the way he like
3732360	3738360	the cops sat him down and they're just like the cops were almost addicted to shame
3738360	3741360	and the part of the perpetrator where they're like, well, this is the part where
3741360	3745360	we corner you and you eventually like just admit that you can't lie anymore.
3745360	3750360	But he just he had like this weird superpower where he was like, yeah, I guess
3750360	3754360	I guess you're I guess that does sound crazy and then just silence and they're
3754360	3761360	like and and he's like and nothing and he kind of any just that he found the
3761360	3765360	the reminded me a lot of Donald Trump's effect on like like the media things
3765360	3767360	where it was just like we're not weird.
3767360	3769360	We don't know how to deal with this.
3769360	3773360	We've never had someone just like would know they're not smart.
3773360	3774360	They're not stupid.
3774360	3775360	They're just broke.
3775360	3779360	He just like went through like he just didn't he just said as little as possible
3779360	3783360	and then just sat there and he he got away with it until he and then he and then
3783360	3787360	he killed himself and his kid anyways like that.
3787360	3791360	Like that we used to say because that was many people asking that question.
3791360	3794360	How do you how would you how would you get away with murder having studied all
3794360	3795360	this stuff?
3795360	3797360	The answer used to be have a boat.
3797360	3799360	I don't think that's true at all anymore.
3799360	3800360	No, no, no.
3800360	3801360	They're covered with cameras.
3801360	3802360	Everyone.
3802360	3803360	That's the new way to solve a crime.
3803360	3804360	Have a boat.
3804360	3806360	It was good before there was cameras everywhere.
3806360	3807360	Now.
3807360	3811360	Now the answer is just don't actually like like like as long as you can
3811360	3818360	actually get rid of the body like like don't just say nothing like like and
3818360	3822360	let it get used to the feeling of everyone pointing at you and screaming
3822360	3828360	murderer but that just react to that like man and then I'll have a sandwich
3828360	3832360	and then like our society doesn't know what to do with that person.
3832360	3833360	Right.
3833360	3839360	I think in terms of like how to get away with murder if we're going there
3839360	3841360	someone not connected to you in any way.
3841360	3842360	That's how you do it.
3842360	3847360	And then also what I would do is if you inject someone who's not diabetic
3847360	3850360	with insulin they have a heart attack.
3850360	3851360	Okay.
3851360	3853360	We should cut this out.
3853360	3855360	It's very easy to get insulin.
3855360	3857360	That's crazy.
3857360	3860360	And it's naturally occurring in the human body so they don't test for it.
3860360	3861360	Hell yeah.
3861360	3864360	We're fucking solving problems on heart attack.
3867360	3868360	That's crazy.
3868360	3871360	That leads to a question I've always I've always kind of had about true
3871360	3879360	crime or crime in general which is like do we think that there's a and I don't
3879360	3882360	know if the term should be serial killer or not but like yeah I guess it should
3882360	3889360	be like do we how do I how do I phrase this question is there a is there a
3889360	3900360	fringe of incredibly successful serial killers who are so like good at what
3900360	3906360	they do that they have body counts in astronomical numbers and will never be
3906360	3911360	caught and have never been caught or is it like no we just we catch them
3911360	3915360	eventually you know what I mean I don't know how to phrase the question it's
3915360	3920360	sort of like most of the time I think they do realize that it's a serial
3920360	3924360	hopefully but I do also think serial matters are the hardest to solve we talk
3924360	3928360	about is quite a lot on the show because they do do exactly what Hannah just said
3928360	3931360	they kill people that they don't know there's no connection and no connection
3931360	3935360	between the victims no connection between them and the victim so it's really hard
3935360	3939360	for them to connect the dots and realize and I think there are definitely serial
3939360	3943360	killers out there with huge huge head counts head counts well that's not the
3943360	3948360	body counts especially if they've been killing people that society doesn't care
3948360	3952360	about right and if they're really good we don't know prostitutes die all the time
3952360	3957360	and that's what lots of cereal in LA there's like a serial killer that's just
3957360	3960360	been like busting homeless people's heads and then it just kind of like he
3960360	3963360	killed a bunch of people and then stopped and people were just like yeah don't
3963360	3967360	know what happened and like that problem person might be still doing it yeah
3967360	3973360	like last year's family that's that's banging down the doors on the police
3973360	3978360	station saying like follow up on this right nobody cares even when there is
3978360	3982360	sometimes the thing is if it's like and we've talked about cases where the
3982360	3986360	victims are sex workers and the narrative will be oh no one was looking
3986360	3989360	for them or no one was telling them there were there were they had you know
3989360	3992360	mothers and fathers and sisters and social workers telling the police to
3992360	3997360	look but the thing is serial killer investigations are so expensive and
3997360	4003360	it's resourcing and it's about who how much was this person worth to society
4003360	4009360	right not a whole lot yeah if she's if she's a blonde rich girl then then
4009360	4013360	there's more like traction on that and there's also that element of victim
4013360	4016360	blaming like Dan was talking about the start in terms of well what do you
4016360	4021360	expect you were you were homeless or you were a sex worker or you were doing
4021360	4027360	this so it was bound to happen eventually this was inevitable yeah and
4027360	4030360	I think that there's definitely an element of that so I think definitely
4030360	4034360	there are serial killers out there with huge body counts that we haven't tracked
4034360	4038360	down because of who they were killing and where they're doing it as well like
4038360	4042360	it's a communication between police department that's the truck driver thing
4042360	4046360	right like that guy that was just or that guy might still be not caught right
4046360	4050360	isn't there some American like truck driver guy they think he's a truck
4050360	4054360	driver I'm sure there's loads that just like they're starting to put the thing
4054360	4058360	together like the idea that this person has just been murdering like what do
4058360	4063360	they call them lot lizards I don't know what the term is for the like the sex
4063360	4066360	workers that frequent like truck stops and things like that hitchhikers and
4066360	4071360	things like and that you just like if you they just study the jurisdictions
4071360	4075360	and they go this these investigations will never be yeah they will never be
4075360	4081360	related to in any single investigators mind I think one thing I'd love to add
4081360	4085360	to that those and more and more now those we talked about it on a couple of
4085360	4089360	episodes with the DNA stuff now people just giving all of their DNA to these
4089360	4092360	private companies and then they're put into publicly searchable databases the
4092360	4096360	police can search through them and then they caught the Golden State Killer last
4096360	4100360	year yeah I don't know how I feel about that at all yeah it's crazy it's
4100360	4104360	absolutely impossible to have a conversation where you're anti-catch a
4104360	4111360	horrible predator you can't come down against that but I never predicted that
4111360	4114360	this would happen I always predicted that we would have a point as a society
4114360	4118360	where we got to have an increasingly difficult debate right we've never done
4118360	4122360	any of that for any technology we well I remember when they started putting chips
4122360	4127360	and cats yeah like my cat had a microchip in it and I was like where's
4127360	4131360	this going and it was it was it was safe to have that because they were like
4131360	4134360	thinking about let's do that I'm prisoners too and that way you wouldn't
4134360	4140360	even even need as many bars the chip is the bar like just like but and they
4140360	4144360	always start with house pets and prisoners and then our children because
4144360	4147360	we love our children we don't want anything bad to happen to them and then
4147360	4152360	like civil liberties start increasingly and and so all of a sudden one day the
4152360	4156360	Golden State Killer is caught and then it was almost like a footnote that by
4156360	4160360	the way the way he was caught was this incredibly like way too late to have a
4160360	4164360	debate about it Orwellian threshold we've crossed where because we all want
4164360	4168360	to know how much Neanderthal we have in us we swab our cheeks and send it to
4168360	4172360	these services and then somewhere along the way everyone just it's like oh holy
4172360	4178360	shit you can just I how do we feel about that conflicted because yeah you have
4178360	4182360	the the success stories of like the Golden State Killer and now they're
4182360	4185360	running the DNA for like the zodiac killer and they're like we're gonna get
4185360	4189360	him and all this and yeah cool but then like the stories that are missed is
4189360	4193360	there are so many articles about particularly when we were reading about
4193360	4197360	the Golden State Killer and we did that case about the 40 year old case the
4197360	4201360	bodies in the barrel the bear yeah and when we were doing the research for that
4201360	4205360	I read an article about a guy who was a high school teacher there had been a
4205360	4211360	couple of rapes in the town that he was living in and he he had his his data
4211360	4215360	his DNA was in the database they said it was him they arrested him they took
4215360	4220360	him in they held him didn't charge him turns out it was like his nephew or
4220360	4224360	something and by the time they were able to identify who it really was his life
4224360	4230360	is over he can't be a teacher anymore even if he's proven not to be anybody
4230360	4234360	really want him around their kids anymore I don't know I mean you can you
4234360	4237360	could you could I mean I think Trump's gonna win in 2020 on the slogan no
4237360	4246360	collusion oh he's going to win and then I didn't expect that I said I guess
4246360	4249360	we're all a little worn out also there was no way that the Mueller report was
4249360	4253360	going to be what anybody wanted he's right I just love that idea that it was
4253360	4256360	like that's the big triumph is it gonna be like remember when you thought I was
4256360	4265360	a Russian agent I wasn't yeah like it's like I like Ike it's a sort of it's a
4265360	4270160	little bit more of a negative society when you're doing there I am NOT a crook
4270160	4276960	wasn't Nixon's slogan it was a thing he said while he was being forced out of
4276960	4281640	society it was a thing he was a person who was approached before he resigned it
4281640	4287040	was an impotent like plaintiff whale you don't have to resign now you can be a
4287040	4292240	complete asshole and get reelected he's going to be reelected everybody sorry
4292240	4296160	anyway ready that did remind me of one thing I would never look at this podcast
4296160	4301240	reviews but I did look at yours because I was just curious and you guys got a
4301240	4306600	flood this fucking pissed me off like I like you guys got a bunch of one-star
4306600	4314160	reviews that were people that your Central Park 5 episode going like I used
4314160	4317280	to like this podcast but I didn't know it was gonna be about shaming the
4317280	4323520	American president oh yeah what he wasn't president when he became famous
4323520	4327840	for taking out a full he's part of a true crime story right he's part of the
4327840	4330840	story like we got I think we got one in there the UK as well this guy be like
4330840	4334360	oh these people do you talk about Trump all the time this happened 30 years ago
4334360	4339600	why is he being brought he's in the story like what do you want me to do
4339600	4346120	lie it's like if a knife that stabbed someone then became a senator later
4346640	4350960	that it was there it's part of the story I mean it's not like you guys like take
4350960	4354520	a big break and go like by the way here's what we hate about America it was
4354520	4357680	like I just thought it was so amazing that but there was like yeah there was
4357680	4361720	like clearly a big cluster of people are like one star and particularly for
4361720	4366520	people were like I used to like you and then I found out that you that you don't
4366520	4371040	like it when people try to kill people with we're so glad you enjoyed 79 hours
4371040	4377160	of free content before you yelled at us right yeah one thing yeah yeah but it's
4377160	4380760	fine but I also do that I will start listening to show if they say one thing
4380760	4384240	I don't I know it's almost uplifting that they that someone from that demo
4384240	4388720	couldn't get through all those episodes because I it's just an it's just an
4388720	4393160	Anglophile thing if I hear an English accent I assume you hate me and I'm not
4393160	4397520	even I'm as liberal as the day is long but I'm just like well they would think
4397520	4403340	I was tacky I mean listen to them they sound like James Bond I like a JK
4403340	4407960	Rowling on Twitter is fucking hilarious and someone said like because she like
4407960	4413360	outed like gay characters and she just recently confirmed that a Dumbledore and
4413360	4418320	Grindelwald had all sorts of crazy nasty sex but like do you guys hear about
4418320	4422760	this yeah yeah and someone I heard they did they can and didn't in a dumpster
4422760	4430080	behind Hogwarts Hogwarts has a dumpster yeah that's that's what's so weird it's
4430080	4434800	like she's gay but it's like it's getting really thin these justifications
4434800	4438800	I don't think there was a dumpster so well she's less into magic and more
4438800	4443480	into this PC agenda hogsmeade sure but a dumpster is weird somebody somebody
4443480	4448200	treated her like I I found out that you're into gay culture and like I took
4448200	4452520	all I have all your movies I took all the CDs out and I'm gonna burn them on
4452520	4458440	my lawn and on the lawn yeah and JK Rowling tweeted back said that's great
4458440	4468320	because the fumes are toxic and I have your money fuck you can I ask a true
4468320	4473120	crank oh yeah go ahead it's just like okay so I don't do true crime a lot but
4473120	4476480	it feels like there might be if you could just separate it there's like
4476480	4479400	there's crimes that are kind of solved and there are the details and then
4479400	4482720	there's crimes where you don't have all the details do you prefer one or the
4482720	4485920	other is both part of it is one more fascinating because I don't know I was
4485920	4489160	thinking that it's like part of it's like the search for truth it's like the
4489160	4492440	unknown is there and can I piece it together but there's another part that's
4492440	4496880	like oh here's all the details and maybe I can own all these details and use that
4496880	4499960	knowledge which is kind of the opposite of like a search for truth in the void
4499960	4503960	I don't know does that mean anything yeah I think like in terms of the cases
4503960	4508000	that we do a episode every week possibly misguidedly and but we're here
4508000	4512640	now and so timewise we've just got to keep turning them out everything has to
4512640	4517480	be ready to go on Tuesday night and so what we really want to do is do a long
4517480	4523360	form show about one particular case like a doctor death or a happy face or
4523360	4528720	something like that and where we have the time to like properly investigate and
4528720	4533400	get a lot more and a lot more of the details together but primarily what
4533440	4540240	we're doing on red-handed is storytelling so it's just finding finding
4540240	4544520	what we can and piecing together the story right how do you find them what's
4544520	4550320	your like your like source for like picking your topic I mean the internet
4550320	4555840	hell yeah and I mean linked to that question I really enjoy the ones where
4555840	4559400	there's not all the details out there and we can piece it together and
4559400	4564400	interpret it in a different way but I think it just comes down to time yeah
4564400	4568400	of course we'll text each other something I'm like I need an easy one this week and
4568400	4571480	by that I mean there's a whole shit ton of documentaries out there and there's
4571480	4574840	all this information I can read it put it together and it's like Hannah said
4574840	4579720	we're not doing an investigative podcast we're doing a storytelling one with our
4579720	4584800	opinions in there so it's just time but the interest is really with the ones
4584800	4588280	where there's not that much out there right that's what I'm more captivated by
4588280	4591200	myself but again I'm not a huge fan so I was wondering yeah all right sorry
4591200	4596160	Dan do you think the guy from the the staircase do you think that dude killed
4596160	4600280	her or his son killed her what do you think about that one what's his name
4600280	4609640	Peterson yeah Jordan Peterson I don't know I don't know yeah I don't know
4609640	4612600	either I'm on the fence I'm afraid I can't actually yeah it's weird cuz it's
4612600	4615600	like I remember I there's an old forensic files where it's just like
4615600	4620560	plain and simple like when I can't even remember now yeah I think they're the
4620560	4623200	old forensic files it's just like this is a story about a guy who pushed his
4623200	4626700	wife down the stairs and tried to act like he didn't we got him through
4626700	4630920	forensics and that was like the 90s or something and then there was the whole
4630920	4637320	documentary and like like there's yeah it's I'm whipped back and forth all
4637320	4641480	over the place every time that story I think he and his son did it I think he
4641480	4646640	and he and then the kid let's do so let's do some other classics so that's
4646640	4651520	what somebody asked in the subreddit what about Madeline McCann we get this
4651520	4654960	on all the time they just they just want us to talk about Madeline McCann because
4654960	4660120	she's British talk about yeah yeah but I don't know I feel like Madeline
4660120	4665960	McCann was okay I don't know everybody knows yeah yeah so Madeline McCann was
4666360	4671360	four-year-old girl she was on she's British she was on holiday with her two
4671360	4675080	parents in Portugal who are doctors by the way yeah that's an important part of
4675080	4680080	the story and then they are like you know having a good time they'd like go
4680080	4683080	have dinner every night in this restaurant with their friends and leave
4683080	4688440	the kids in the apartment unlocked or unlocked or on their own and then they'd
4688440	4692680	be like it's just like having dinner in the garden but it's like it's fucking
4692680	4696640	far like it's not like having dinner in your garden and then one night they go
4696640	4701280	to so they basically do a rotor of one of the people having tapas going and
4701280	4705240	checking on all the kids every like 15 minutes and they go in the room and then
4705240	4710280	Madeline's gone but that her brother and sister are asleep in the room too and so
4710280	4715480	really it's either she wandered out and she fell down a well or something I
4715480	4719680	don't know or she was abducted or the parents killed her and then the whole
4719680	4722840	investigation was did the parents do it or not because when the mum comes out
4722840	4726840	of the room the first thing she says is they've taken her I was just gonna say
4726840	4730400	maybe they were involved in some kind of high-end dark art like cult thing and
4730400	4737520	they were like give us your favorite one yeah wait wait why is they've taken her
4737520	4740920	why why I just think if you were like she was kind of sounds like she was
4740920	4744120	expecting something to happen like who's there if your kid was missing and you
4744120	4748640	saw wouldn't you just be like she had she had like details that she wouldn't
4748640	4752240	have known right it just seems like but this is the classic thing right yeah of
4752240	4758080	like judging someone whose kids just been snagged a lot of people have it's
4758080	4764040	like okay so use this as an example so so this is like why is this case like
4764040	4768160	extremely like it's a magnet for everybody the reason is because there's
4768160	4773600	enough room for speculation that it just it's a sandbox for everybody right and
4773600	4777880	then and then there's this other question of okay so it at what point are
4777880	4786480	we you know do we ever think about families of victims suspects when the
4786480	4791760	stuff is still unsolved no matter how cold the case may be do we how do we
4791760	4795640	deal with the karma the thought of like these are human beings that move on
4795640	4798880	through their life they haven't been convicted they haven't been in then
4798880	4804000	they're don't they have a right to like listen to podcasts and like do we ever
4804000	4809120	do you guys run this through in your head like what if what if so-and-so or
4809120	4814000	their family or whatever is listening yeah I do I worry about that quite a lot
4814000	4820440	and we just have to be okay with the fact that we feel like most of the cases
4820440	4826600	we've done we never laugh at the victim we never mocking the victim so I would
4826600	4834120	hope that they wouldn't ever feel like we were a little hard on the tandem
4834120	4839520	bicycle couple park five thing is a little snobby yeah where we do where we
4839520	4844360	are snobs two people in love might get on a tandem bike and ride it through
4844360	4849080	Central Park that's true I just have never seen it in the wild it also it
4849080	4854280	also destroyed our scene setting of New York in the 80s yeah I did all this work
4855000	4858240	a divided city and the rich getting richer the poor getting poor and then
4858240	4867080	there's that's why they decidedly did not deserve to be questioned like they
4867080	4871280	are anyway sorry go ahead no we spent the first 15 minutes that episode
4871280	4875840	talking about the AIDS epidemic the crack epidemic the gang wars and I did a
4875840	4879040	lot of research into the crack epidemic and we talked about it all and then the
4879040	4883720	next paragraph was and then it was 9 30 p.m. in Central Park in Central Park
4884520	4887960	and this couple right passed on a tandem bike like I probably wrote that poorly
4887960	4894960	that was probably they believed the pamphlets I mean they almost paid with
4894960	4901000	their lives the yeah so like I so Madeline McCann like you get you where
4901000	4904600	are you guys standing here it sounds like you're thinking like like now I've
4904600	4907960	now I feel gross because we now we just touched on the topic of whatever like
4907960	4914160	like I it feels grody to then go what do you think the parents did it well a
4914160	4917360	lot of people do you think that the parents did it until this new Netflix
4917360	4920080	documentary came out and I've heard a lot of people who were like staunch her
4920080	4923040	parents did it who'd now changed their minds I haven't watched it yeah yeah I've
4923040	4926960	been watching it and I can't tell if the Netflix documentary is exonerating them
4926960	4930560	if it feels like that because it's just incredibly sluggish and they haven't
4930560	4933440	gotten to the point where they start crucifying the parents exactly the first
4933440	4936800	episode is just you watch the first step you can skip the first episode about
4936800	4940000	Madeline McCann documentary unless you want to know lots and lots of
4940000	4943320	unnecessary information about pride allusion in the 80s like I don't know
4943320	4946560	is it one of those things where like like the parents shook the kid killed the
4946560	4951080	kid and said oh fuck we just killed our kid now we got the theory is that they
4951080	4957060	sedated her well not the theory a theory is that they sedated her and then they
4957060	4959880	go after dinner so they can have a great time and they come back and she's dead
4959880	4963480	oh that's a thing people do that the people people drug their kids like
4963480	4967800	instead of have babies they just dope them up and it's important that their
4967800	4971640	doctors I mean it god forbid that they're that they're innocent and then
4971640	4975160	all of this is being said but it's like the other their occupation like draws
4975160	4981480	that you're like what if your doctors and your you know you you just want your
4981480	4986040	kids to sleep while you go have don't they know that that's dangerous I mean
4986040	4988640	you're not I don't think you're supposed to administer sedatives all the time
4988640	4992440	like that well I got I got converted this is the interesting thing about this to
4992440	4996080	me is that the reason the way that we found the guy that I call Asperger
4996080	5001720	detective oh yeah I like this guy I have you have you listened no I just I
5001720	5005680	really want you to listen to his podcast I'm not saying that you're like
5005680	5013400	him like I hope so like like he's he is just such a like he's so yeah okay it's
5013400	5018400	like he's so what I well I I want to know whether you would love him or hate
5018400	5021800	him I'm excited I he's a very interesting guy what's it called what's
5021800	5026360	the podcast it's it's such a weird forgettable name it's like like it's
5026360	5034560	like his he's not like a marketing guru he's not a person person he he owns it
5034560	5040780	he's like he's like there's he's not a person person his reviews are 50% one
5040780	5045400	star 50% five star the one stars are like what the fuck is this guy's problem
5045400	5049360	usually so self-congratulatory and he's sort of like always things and I'm like
5049360	5052920	I'm like well if you're gonna hate somebody for this stuff then he's my
5052920	5056200	hero and then the other ones are like he's so deep and thoughtful and
5056200	5062020	interesting cuz he sorry I'm babbling but but he the from a with the reason we
5062020	5067200	found his podcast is because Rosanna is that her name Rosanna from the kill
5067200	5073520	California dreaming who's another favorite of ours she was she was asked she
5073520	5078040	just California dream she just does California myself on the balls she's
5078040	5082440	great she's great hearing that she's great like she's not great it's a
5082440	5087320	terrible she's great these people aren't like fucking like they don't go to like
5087320	5092000	graphic design school for their logos they don't go to like how like branding
5092000	5095480	school like they're they're really into true crime and like some of the best
5095480	5101680	people have the worst like California dreaming but she focuses on California
5101680	5106040	and she's truly she's really good and if I kill somebody it's gonna be someone
5106040	5110640	that calls their podcast California dreaming interestingly thing is I have a
5110640	5116120	boat she's very thorough and she's very academic and somebody asked her she's
5116120	5123240	dead I knew it somebody asked her is there any true if she turns up dead
5123240	5130560	tomorrow or missing I I did it you're going to jail based on a title yes they
5130560	5136920	get worse oh what yeah no like what's worse than kill a four well actually okay
5136920	5142560	there they don't get what come up with a worst name of true crime there's like
5142560	5147560	one that's like all Austin true crime and it's called like killers and cattle
5147560	5151200	or something I don't know it's either like like all crime no cattle I can't
5151200	5154720	it's like it's not really trying to make a Texas thing happen just let me
5154720	5160640	finish my thought okay I'm just gonna I just realized I'm a murderer and I've
5160640	5166360	told you all and I'm fine doing the time Rosanna from California dreaming was as
5166360	5172400	a Cody told me this that that she was asked is there a case that you changed
5172400	5177800	your mind on based on an episode of another person's true crime podcast so
5177800	5181600	these are really interesting question that I'd like to ask you guys but and
5181600	5190640	she said yes Asperger detectives she didn't call him that this guy his his
5190640	5195200	podcast is called I mean I'm gonna give I'm gonna give him I gives his due
5195200	5201720	signal boost I mean I look I love the guy and same deal buddy I'll fly you out
5201720	5207200	from Los Angeles he lives in LA he lives in LA it's totally affordable I
5207200	5211620	should get them on then I can't remember it's called like cold case
5211620	5217640	correct murder files mold cold-case murder mysteries Cody said cold cold-case
5217640	5223560	murder mysteries he's yeah he's this guy and he talks like this and he never
5223560	5228400	stops talking like this like you won't I mean like like look you've been he's
5228400	5235360	polarizing but he is like he he approaches the she said yes his
5235360	5241280	treatment of the Madeleine McCain story like it changed her mind and when you
5241280	5244440	listen to it that's that's an episode I would recommend if you want to get into
5244440	5248840	this guy as his Madeleine McCain episode because he just sort of makes it seem
5248840	5255000	incredibly obvious that there was never a plan they what they they were on
5255000	5259880	vacation they were they were using micro doses of like you know kind of
5259880	5263400	sedative that they were caught they're very comfortable with as a professional
5263400	5267720	couple of doctors they were like just keeping the kids there was a there the
5267720	5271960	kids already on the trip had been actually getting up out of bed and like
5271960	5277840	you know they they just they crossed a threshold of like let's just Nyquil them
5277840	5286920	but on a pro level and and that and that actually like not that they they
5286920	5290720	didn't owe Diem because you're correct they wouldn't do that they would know
5290720	5296360	the right amount and what actually did happen is that the the kid was high and
5296360	5304400	got up still and was tooling around the place alone and like was playing on like
5304400	5310400	this spot where the one of the the dogs did go to when they were investigating
5310400	5314640	one of the corpse sniffing dogs like descended on this one area of the the
5314640	5321280	the room where the Asperger detective I have to stop calling him that cold case
5321280	5326600	murder mystery says says that that's she probably she may be like fell off the
5326600	5330280	cap I mean she was four right it's like like like it's just she maybe climbed up
5330280	5335240	on top and like fell and like the just freak accident total freak accident they
5335240	5342720	they found out about it and then they kind of like just worked out a thing
5342720	5350160	where they like and it's actually like that version of events I a I feel bad
5350160	5356360	for the for the parents if that really happened because they they would be in a
5356360	5360000	they would be their lives would be fucked they come home to that and it's
5360000	5364200	like it's a tragedy I'm not saying any it's just like imagine that and it's
5364200	5368760	like oh god the what do any of us do when we're pushed to the point where a
5368760	5373520	lie is equidistant from from the truth in terms of like how much it fucks up
5373520	5378920	your life where you're like I don't I don't know what I'm made of in if I'm
5378920	5383000	ever put in a position like that I'm not sure I mean we kind of like we've all
5383000	5387160	been in situations where like we're gonna lie was just just easier did they
5387160	5392280	find the child and did they do an autopsy no they've never found a trace of
5392280	5396920	the kid which is in its in and of itself it's just incredibly strange I mean how
5396920	5400880	do you I think that's the thing that makes it feel like it's not the parents
5400880	5406040	because if they if they did do it I do think it's like you said done like they
5406040	5409800	it was an accident they didn't maliciously murder I got a bunch of
5409800	5415120	other kids they're not like we hate kids we want to live a free life but
5415120	5419000	and they're in a foreign country they don't they're not from Portugal they're
5419000	5422240	on holiday that they're in like a holiday resort where have they taken
5422240	5425520	this four-year-old body that the British police went and helped as well so the
5425520	5429360	Portuguese police and the British police are looking for Maddie and they never
5429360	5433760	found her and the parents in a foreign country were able to dispose of this
5433760	5438000	four-year-old's body that well that's the thing that doesn't make sense to me
5438000	5442680	it's also just strange the idea of like a rando that comes in a back door and
5442680	5452000	takes a kid how do they that was one of a D's points was like this is a beef
5452000	5457640	dancer Asperger this is a this is a sloppy crime you don't it's isn't like
5457640	5463760	it's not like specter or like you know whatever the bad guy whose name you
5463760	5468600	can't say it was like I must have like this one it wasn't like an it's not an
5468600	5474440	organized thing you'd go in and snatch a kid and if they did take them they took
5474440	5479760	them in a it's like that person doesn't then put the energy and resources into
5479760	5485620	making someone vanish right exactly and I think like snatching a kid like Madeline
5485620	5490440	McCann is incredibly high risk like it's the same thing with Amy Bradley like
5490440	5493240	kidnapping someone who's on a cruise ship where there's physically nowhere to
5493240	5498000	go like why are you what is the gain for you that is so huge that makes that
5498000	5503000	worth it in such a heart like high-risk high-stage do you guys think happened to
5503000	5511720	her on the cruise ship Amy Bradley you think she fell overboard I think um well
5511720	5516680	give me the the meat and potatoes of that oh sorry yeah I don't know you're
5516680	5522200	talking about Amy Bradley American lady I think she was in her early 20s I think
5522200	5528120	went on a cruise with her family and she disappeared and as they were like
5528120	5533640	out to sea like round Aruba and and there's all this stuff they get to Aruba
5533640	5536360	they can't find her she's been missing for hours but they're on a they're on a
5536360	5539640	ship so they're like what she's clearly here we just don't know where so they
5539640	5543440	did a bit of a half-hour search anyway they never found her and there was a
5543440	5549640	couple of sightings of her this one guy who's just the worst human being said
5549640	5553320	that he contacted her family said I know where I know where she is she's
5553320	5556520	living on a compound with this man who's got sleeve tattoos and long blonde hair
5556520	5560240	I can extract her for you so they sent him all of this money and it was all
5560240	5564400	bullshit wasn't true so he was just sitting on an island in the Caribbean
5564400	5568720	off their money for months at a time anyway so the leading theories are that
5568720	5571600	she was sold into sex slavery there's because it's the Dutch Caribbean where
5571600	5576920	she was so obviously it has the same laws as the Netherlands for sex work
5576920	5583120	etc and and there's a picture which people think is her from years later on
5583120	5587760	like one of these like sex holiday websites but wait she was extracted off
5587760	5593000	of this cruise ship yeah somehow maybe yeah or she fell overboard but like
5593000	5597520	bodies generally wash up like they weren't that far out to sea it's a it's a
5597520	5602480	it's a nightmare scenario because it's like you find out like that these these
5602480	5609000	cruise lines they're they're owned by they're not accountable to the laws that
5609000	5614000	we think they are they're like they purposely even if they are American
5614000	5621960	corporations they purposely work through international law because that makes it
5621960	5625360	a lot easier to abuse labor for instance so the guy teaching you shuffleboard can
5625360	5630520	only be paid a penny if you're not an American you know who this is a case for
5630520	5639480	Asperger I will I will okay I guess I'm not surprised we burnt through all our
5639480	5645080	time but I did I think I always like what do you guys have a I don't know
5645080	5648640	what the word favorite means in this context do you have a favorite case I
5648640	5653520	whatever that means to you and then I'm gonna tell you mine one that we've done
5653520	5659680	on the show or not I if one that you can't do because you it's too gross
5659720	5662480	because that's another question which I think the answer is no to like is there
5662480	5666000	something that's somehow off-limits are you asking is there one that's unsolved
5666000	5670840	that is the most fascinating or I leave it to you whatever the word favorite
5670840	5676480	might mean I don't know like is that we do have one that we won't ever do
5676480	5683280	junco oh yeah we'd never do junco for Utah I don't know what that is well I
5683280	5686360	guess I guess the reason you won't do it is because you you would be doing it by
5686360	5691440	describing it to me that would be the product it's it's really really bad I
5691440	5694320	think we've done a lot of research and come back to your first question of like
5694320	5699240	how much does this fuck you up junco fruit is the only case that I looked at
5699240	5705920	and read about that I was like in I was in floods of tears after I read what
5705920	5710440	happened to that girl is horrifying it interestingly though before I forget
5710440	5718000	like what like I think Jeff did it an astounding thing these girls do a
5718000	5722440	Halloween episode have you done how many you have a you've only been on for
5722440	5726160	done to okay you've done two Halloween's their Halloween episodes are
5726160	5732640	like they they go out of their way to go into the worst possible shit even
5732640	5737600	relative to true crime desensitization like the war it really is super
5737600	5740440	effective by the way like I don't know if those are like your more popular
5740440	5743760	episodes because I honestly like I don't I don't go to these things kidding
5743760	5748960	myself like I'm here to be a hero I it's the opposite like I'm I go to true crime
5748960	5754040	to take a break from the pressure of like that exists of like oh if I choose
5754040	5758320	right or wrong I'm a good or a bad person and I'm listening to where the
5758320	5763320	pinball machine breaks down like as Spencer alluded to it's like debugging
5763320	5768160	society you're going okay well this is this you'll Brenner in Westworld like
5768160	5773080	went nuts and started shooting up the saloon like I gravitate towards that I
5773080	5777680	want to know details I don't I don't I would never bother to go as far as to
5777680	5781240	say it's because I want to prevent it from happening or it's because I love
5781240	5785600	the people so much or because I think I might be the guy that did it it's it's
5785600	5790360	all just like rubbernecking it's just sort of like what what went wrong what
5790360	5795960	happened how does this work how it's just I don't know why I do that we
5795960	5803320	gravitate to that stuff you wait but we we got you said you wouldn't do that one
5803320	5807040	guy that's too fucked up right you do you have like what's yeah do you have a
5807040	5814240	favorite it's a dumb question it makes no sense what's our favorite like murder
5814240	5822080	story it doesn't make mine cereal adnan you guys hear about this adnan fellow
5822080	5828200	okay I'll tell you look here's my thing I'll talk for a while I tried I have a
5828200	5836320	finally dang it's a platform this is my this is my request because I've done I
5836320	5840040	don't remember who did that I think maybe true crime garage did did did her
5840400	5845920	but I don't hear a lot about her and I continue to be confounded about what
5845920	5849920	could possibly have happened and why there's not more investigation Kanika
5849920	5857440	Powell I think she lived in Maryland she's American for sure she if you look
5857440	5868400	it up Kanika K-a-n-i-k-a Powell young lady who her apartment like a guy comes
5868400	5872520	to her apartment door knocks on the door and says he's an FBI agent she's
5872520	5876200	looking through the peephole the nightmare of this story the reason
5876200	5881200	people gravitate to it is because she does everything right she never does
5881200	5887400	anything wrong and it she looks through the peephole and the guy says I'm an FBI
5887400	5891920	agent can I come in I want to talk to you about something and she goes he
5891920	5896520	holds up a badge and she's like she asks him some question I can't remember was
5896520	5901680	like do you have a badge number or like is there it's a she knows to ask him
5901680	5906000	something and he just fucking walks away and it's like the middle of the
5906000	5909920	night and she then goes over to her window and she watches the strange dude
5909920	5913600	who just pretended to be an FBI agent walking away from her apartment
5913600	5919620	building and she hears another male voice saying yeah she doesn't see the
5919620	5923560	source of the voice but she could she she reason we know this is because she
5923560	5928720	she keeps records she emails friends and family about these incidents that
5928720	5933240	that she hears another voice saying other way or something like that and the
5933240	5936160	guy turns around and walks the other way she doesn't see the source of the voice
5936160	5939200	he's gonna round the corner one way and then he goes the opposite direction I
5939200	5946340	mean I'm already tear if the story ended there I'm like she emails there's
5946340	5951680	emails online that's part of what's attractive about the case is that it's
5951680	5956600	just so it's it feels like real-life creepy pasta because she's we have your
5956600	5960240	emails that she's sending to her friends and family and I where she's
5960240	5965840	explaining what happened to her and then five days later another knock at her
5965840	5974120	door and a different guy at the door says I have a package for you and she
5974120	5978680	goes where is it or something like again she doesn't she doesn't do anything
5978680	5983360	stupid she reacts exactly the way you're supposed to react and the guy
5983360	5990260	leaves and doesn't leave a package it's a different guy she is like this is in a
5990260	5997160	span of a week she works for a laboratory that does work for homeland
5997160	6001220	security that's part of also why this is such a fucking freak out because you
6001220	6007180	can't ask the cops can't ask her job anything about who she works with like
6007980	6013120	someone and she had one of those jobs that where if you asked her what she did
6013120	6016540	that day she had to tell you I'm not allowed to tell you now there's lots of
6016540	6020020	those jobs and they're not all area 51 like level shit but there's just some
6020020	6023560	certain jobs where you're not allowed to tell your family what you did that day
6023560	6027580	at work she had one of those jobs and and when the when the homicide
6027580	6034900	investigators call her boss you know after she's spoilers dead they they keep
6034900	6040360	telling the cops no we can't tell you anything about about her job and who
6040360	6046900	she worked with and anything and the cops are just like okay and so like so
6046900	6050180	those two incidents happen within five days and I think there was another knock
6050180	6053380	at her door and she's sending these emails to her mother and her sisters
6053380	6057140	it's heartbreaking she called this lease right this yeah she calls the police
6057140	6060260	every time and the police come out and they talk to her and they look for clues
6060260	6064880	and and they she calls the FBI because the guy said and the FBI says yeah no
6064880	6069040	that was definitely not an FBI agent we would never do that ever we don't behave
6069040	6072560	like that we would blah blah blah there's like a whole slew of reasons why
6072560	6077860	that could not have been us thank you for not opening the door this poor girl
6077860	6085680	like like she she then emails again like her her family and goes I think she was
6085680	6088520	gonna take a vacation or something like that and she was like she said she had
6088520	6093880	some errands to run so she took the day off of work after the last time she
6093880	6101400	talked to the cops specifically saying like I I don't want to come to leave or
6101400	6106160	come back to my apartment building at nighttime because I'm a woman and I live
6106160	6112240	alone so I am going to call into work take off of work and like the minute
6112240	6116780	after she talks to the cops the the third time she goes from there and does
6116780	6121720	her errands and she comes home from her errands and the guy that was the UPS
6121720	6126760	package fake guy is in her hallway and shoots her to death and runs away and
6126760	6133560	that's it no robbery no sexual assault didn't want in her apartment just wanted
6133560	6138680	to kill her fine with killing her not in her apartment like didn't need to like
6138680	6145360	multiple men yeah at least why isn't this a task force I what is going on like
6145360	6150480	like this woman worked for a fucking lab that was a government contract like
6151240	6156440	and everyone everyone online all the web slips keep saying like well you can
6156440	6162140	rule out the idea of government hit because it was so sloppy like why would
6162140	6168360	you have a fit that's great at its job like if I if I if I work at if I work for
6168360	6174200	a it's it's that's that there's a if it's it's like we're not saying that
6174200	6180720	like like the Illuminati killed her it's like it's still possible for someone
6180720	6186240	that she worked with to like like want her dead and have a couple friends and
6186240	6190960	other stuff like like I can't it's just anyways so I request I formally request
6190960	6196080	that I only flew you guys out first class you don't have to do what I say
