38600	46840	so in such and such, Harmon Town is now in session!
46840	53320	Who out in the audience tonight feels like it's time to have a Game Master on stage?
53320	59320	Well, I've got good news for you because we have Spencer Crittenden.
59320	70720	Oh, there he is.
70720	72520	But what is the Harmon Town without a mayor?
72520	73520	I don't know.
73520	76520	Let's bring out the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon.
76520	88800	Yo, hip-hop, yo, hip-hop, yo, hip-hop in my bones, hip-hop don't leave me alone, get
88800	94560	around, I'm gonna flow like science, fuck your mama so hard she got hired, but me, okay,
94560	99400	alright, nah, fucked it up, that's it.
99400	101160	I was gonna be your hype man, but you fuckin' bam.
101160	102160	What rhymes with science?
102160	105360	I was gonna hype man you and you stopped rapping.
105360	106360	Clients.
106360	107360	Clients.
107360	108360	Clients.
108360	109360	I mean, I had time, I had time.
109360	112040	So we're gonna slowly build a rap.
112040	113560	Yeah.
113560	118800	Next week I'll be like, I'm gonna drop mad science, I fucked your mama so hard I got
118800	119800	mad clients.
119800	122000	Alright, well I'll do better than that, I won't just say mad things.
122000	125960	Yeah, you could've fucked her on top of any household appliance, it could've been anything.
125960	127960	Oh, that's good.
128960	132840	I fucked your mama like, Jane Michael Vincent in Defiance.
132840	134280	It was a Jane Michael Vincent movie.
134280	135280	Wow.
135280	138880	She gushing fire hydrants.
138880	139880	Is that something?
139880	140880	That works.
140880	141880	Thank you.
141880	148200	Oh, I don't wanna push buttons, I want this to be an introduction to something that's
148200	149200	confessional.
149200	155320	From now on when I talk about things that maybe push people's buttons, I'm gonna make
155320	161200	sure that I use my I statements and I'm gonna talk from a place of human vulnerability.
161200	166880	If I say something that is a political point of view or philosophical point of view about
166880	171720	society or whatever, I'm gonna try to make sure that I'm not saying, well these people
171720	177320	this and those people that, I don't know those people, I know myself, I'm gonna be honest
177320	180800	and I'm gonna say what I feel.
180800	188400	And so I was just explaining to Spencer backstage, a dear friend of mine who I'll give their
188400	196280	anonymity because the people that are passionate about things should, this conversation I'm
196280	200960	having with this person who keeps recommending this Jordan Peterson guy, you gotta listen
200960	203440	to Jordan Peterson.
203440	208600	And I keep going like, yeah I will, by the way I haven't seen Atlanta yet, it's on season
208600	217240	9, so when I don't bother to do something, I don't think it's because I'm stubborn or
217240	222080	doing something, however I do keep saying to the person, I'm gonna listen to him because
222080	228320	you say he's smart, he's interesting and all this stuff, but I will tell you that every
228320	236120	link you send me and every time I Google, it keeps saying, it says from his fans and
236120	242080	God knows people's fans can misrepresent them unintentionally.
242080	245240	How do you know that, Dan?
245240	255840	But it does say things like, you know, truth bomb, Jordan Peterson debunks the concept
255840	264720	of white privilege, disproves the pay gap, blah blah blah, and then I say that back to
264720	271480	the person and then that person always says, like, they go, you know, it's not about the
271480	276800	politics and it's not, that's not the point, I just think he's really interesting, but
276800	285680	there's always, like I never get a, what, why, is he a plumber, what do you mean, because
285680	291160	the headline is that he debunked the concept of white privilege, did he also tell you how
291160	295880	to install a backsplash in your kitchen?
295880	301280	But the reason I bring it up is not, it was not to, I certainly want this person to continue
301280	306960	to, I like people to share, like if you're into somebody, I fucking, we bonded early
306960	312600	on, we love our Noam Chomsky, like who knows if he's fallen in and out of fashion, but
312600	313600	some people.
313600	317240	Noam Chomsky's after here tonight.
317240	320840	Some people could turn red in the face when you mention his name, some people would roll
320840	324000	their eyes automatically, some people are very familiar with him and we'll do either
324000	328920	of those things, some people not familiar at all, we'll do those things, like you and
328920	334440	I started a friendship talking about, because I knew him as a linguist and you knew him
334440	339700	as a political dissident and then we exchanged things and all these things, so I don't want
339700	345640	anybody to ever be afraid that they're going to suggest I read something or listen to something
345640	350160	that because I'm going to like snootily high road them, I brought it up because it's caused
350160	354040	me to do some soul searching here because I'm explaining to the person and it taught
354040	360360	me some things about myself that I want to get off my chest, which is like this, it's
360360	371880	like, it's like oh you got, like I don't, I am not ashamed of the idea of what my detractors
371880	379160	would call virtue signaling, I, or white knighting or whatever kind of code for that stuff, I
379160	386880	don't understand unless you want to challenge society and change it, go toe to toe with
386880	393720	it or get paid to talk about it, why would you want to do anything other than make it
393720	399440	not kill you, I do, like the therapist saying do you want to be happy or do you want to
399440	405240	be right, like I want to be happy, so like isn't that what virtue signaling is, isn't
405240	415280	it, like if you're 45, white, straight, rich, standing on top of a pile of money, why is
415280	422800	it a betrayal, why is it a bad move to shout down to all the poor people that you can hear
422800	431040	you, I'm going to do everything I can to help you, don't set this on fire, I'm on top of
431040	441880	it, I like you and would like this to continue the way it is, I, I, like, but shouldn't they
441880	447000	be concerned that the money is just in a pile, like that seems like, well of course it's
447000	454320	in a pile, that brings up an interesting point, which is that also, you know I actually don't
454320	463040	think this is the ideal situation, I'm gonna try even harder to achieve some changes because
463040	472440	boy I can see your house from here and it's very small, like, like, I, like, people think
472440	478680	that it's somehow a counter argument to say to that you're just saying what you think
478680	485520	people want to hear so that you don't get beaten up or suffer, when did that become
485520	494600	a valid point of view, like, oh, are we revolutionaries when we, when we, like, tell the truth, is
494600	501120	this about knowing the truth, like, do I want to really go home tonight and crack a book
501120	510920	if I have a choice between two books and one says femilesbian colon how women are treated
510920	517100	unfairly and have been since the dawn of humankind asterisk, notice we didn't say mankind because
517100	524840	fuck men, and then the other book is like the big lie how liberalism is no different
524840	536000	from Nazis and why Nazism isn't that bad anyway. I don't want to read either book. I still
536000	541000	have that one for sale on Amazon right now. I told you not to self-publish, I told you,
541000	547760	you're gonna end up spending more than you make. You're being a real femile cap on Nazi right now.
547760	559560	If I'm on a sinking ship and I'm like, I got one book for the next 10 years, I'm gonna, not
559560	566480	because I'm so fucking noble and open-minded, I'm gonna take the feminist book because it's
566480	573960	gonna have more information that I don't already have and don't suffer from, you know, I'm kind
573960	581080	of like, I don't, Dan just read my book, just give it a chance. I don't want to know, I don't want to
581080	586840	be able to, if I, I don't want to be in a, what conversation am I ever gonna have in the future
586840	592040	where I'm gonna be thinking, boy oh boy, this would go so much better, as bad as it's going,
592040	598320	god it would go better if I just had the academic chops to prove that maternity leave is unfair.
598320	607920	I just, god damn it, I don't have the fucking noodle for it. I do have the noodle for it,
607920	615200	that's the problem. Whether I believe it passionately or not, what I don't have in
615200	622200	my head is the, is the, is the reasons why people be talking about other stuff and I want to, I want
622200	634600	people to like me. Say that again. Where do you stand on building seven? What's the, what is the
634600	645800	least popular opinion? Spencer said something really funny, we were talking about, because we were
645800	651760	talking about, because I'm gonna listen to the, I'm gonna listen to the Jordan Peterson thing,
651800	656040	but you were talking about the natural, naturalist thing when you're going like, some of this stuff
656040	660760	is like, people say, you gotta listen to this guy, and then you listen to the guy, and it's like,
660760	665360	oh he's so smart, it's like they got a PhD, and they're like, oh man, they gave a lecture, and it
665360	669760	was so amazing the way they broke it down, and like a lot of it comes down to like naturalism
669760	675560	tropes, where it's like, hey, people aren't naturally monogamous, or the way humans work
675560	680800	isn't like this or that, and it's like, and I, and I said, yeah but people don't poop in toilets
680800	688560	naturally, like we just kind of, yeah, toilets are great, and you, and you said, yeah, Spencer's
688560	697040	summation of the naturalist fallacy is like, is like, hey man, ducks don't be gay. That's the,
697040	703840	that's the fallacy, people say, yeah, the naturalization fallacy is, ducks don't be gay. I didn't,
704160	709760	I didn't service it in the retail area. It's that, it's that people say, oh, this isn't natural,
709760	715200	therefore it's bad, and then they say like, oh, you know, like, like an argument against gay
715200	719680	marriage, or whatever, it's like, gay, being gay is unnatural, it's like, ducks aren't gay in the
719680	724960	wild, animals aren't gay, and then of course animals are gay in the wild, but like, but like
724960	730000	that, it's a fallacy that people make to prove their point when they get, but a fallacy is an
730000	736720	invalid argument by nature. Anyway, I, I do a lot of research, I love it, I'm on, I'm online all the
736720	742720	time, checking things, reading things, who knows if they're good or bad, I don't know, it's the
742720	749120	internet, but basically everything that I understand about Jordan Peterson just comes down to that
749120	754480	fallacy, it's like, well actually it turns out like lobsters like kill each other, and so like,
754480	758800	it's fine to want to kill each other, or like, you know, it's just all that fallacy where it's just
758800	763600	like, well no, that's not true, you have anything else, and the answer is no. Sometimes he's giving
763600	768400	one of those talks, and if somebody just starts from the audience going like, hey, I like your
768400	773200	wife, I want to fuck your wife, and he's like, sorry, excuse me, like he wouldn't have security
773200	778160	escort that person out, right, because he doesn't believe in marriage, and he'd be happy if he is
778160	784160	married to have a stronger person with a louder voice that, that felt like talking at that moment,
784160	789600	like microphones aren't fucking cavemen, I don't, but I'm not, I'm not, I'm not speaking, I'm not
789600	794880	lampooning this person, because I don't want to commit the crime of like making, you, you, you've,
794880	801360	you've maybe read or heard him, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just riffing on the idea of like the
801360	807760	people that go like, you know, monogamy's not a thing, like in 58 countries, and stuff, it's like,
807760	814320	yeah, man, I, when, when did you ever get the impression that humanity like wanted to be natural,
814320	820640	like, like, how is that our gimmick, like, like, I just, I just felt confounded by it, and I kind
820640	824640	of like, maybe I wasn't confounded by it six years ago, I mean, I know if you listen to this podcast,
824640	831040	you're going to hear me take complete 180s on a lot of fundamental stuff, and I, I don't, I'm not
831040	835760	going to chalk it up to turbulent times or anything changing, I'm gonna, I'm gonna first and foremost
835760	844400	say I'm old, I'm, I'm, I'm, thank God, successful, I, I, I just, I just have this amazing, like, weird,
845680	850880	unsettling couples therapy session with Cody, where we went, we went in to, to get the 60,000
850880	857600	mile checkup, and kind of, we were like, it was a, because we had back-to-back sessions that were
857600	862240	going to be solo, but if we come in together, that is like, like, that's our choice, and then,
863120	867760	so it was like, basically, like, it could, it could have been a two-hour session, or a two,
867760	873200	you know, two, whatever 50 plus 50 is, a hundred minute session.
876480	877680	What is 50 plus 50?
879920	885840	And it was like, way more than like, 20 minutes before the end of it all, where clearly the
885840	891760	therapist just ran out of gas, was like, like, by virtue of our happiness, like, she was like,
891840	896960	huh, okay, well, ah, look, I don't know what to tell you guys.
901600	908080	You love each other, and you communicate, and that seems to be working, and I gotta tell you,
908080	912400	I've had a pretty long day of heterosexual couples, like, fucking bringing me down with
912400	914960	a bunch of shit about the same shit you're talking about, because they don't know how to
914960	918960	do what you guys do, which is, you kind of just like each other, don't you? Yeah, I think it's
918960	924800	working, I think it's working, and you know what, it's five o'clock, and I was like, yeah,
924800	927760	I'll go eat, and Cody's like, yep, let's get out of here, I'm hungry, and I was like, yep,
927760	932800	let's get out of here, bye, like, we're fucking perfect. So you nailed it. We did it.
939600	944800	And I gotta tell you, I'm getting the same vibe in my solo sessions, too, I think I'm a perfect
944800	950800	individual, as well. So you know when you've nailed it with your therapist, when you've bored
950800	954160	her to pieces, and she wants to get the fuck out of there? Yeah, she's sort of like, and I kind of
954160	958720	project on her, because I'm a cynic, I'm like, on a storyteller, I'm kind of just thinking like,
958720	963040	oh, she's a married lesbian, I wonder if part of her is thinking like, yeah, it must be nice,
963040	968080	what the fuck, get out of here, you know? Because it's like, we're talking about, well, maybe we're
968080	973680	going to move in together, and you know, we think about children, but we don't think about children
973680	978240	and all this stuff, and like, just kind of like, I know it's probably not the case, because she just
978240	982880	makes these faces, she has these like, faces she makes when she's actually like, when she's certain
982880	988960	about things, and it kind of just like, doubles as someone who is secretly hateful. But it's not,
988960	995840	okay, but she's just kind of like, yeah, you know, seems like it's working, huh? Yeah, yeah.
996800	1001920	And okay, I like thinking that she wants to stab our eyes out, because she's like, must be nice,
1001920	1004640	time to go home to my lesbian wife, god damn it!
1010240	1012320	That is not me saying that lesbians are less happy.
1014000	1016080	No, that's exactly what you said.
1016080	1020960	That is not true. That's not what I, well, it may be true that that's what I accidentally applied,
1020960	1026480	but I absolutely, the grass is always greener, I picture lesbians as being incredibly happy,
1026480	1031840	because you probably have to, and I'm sure they fight all the time, like, cats and cats,
1031920	1039360	all right, come on. Stupid, it's dumb, it's stupid. Well, cats, stupid, stupid, dumb jokes.
1040480	1044320	But I actually, I always picture gay people as happier than straight people in couples,
1044320	1048320	because you, then it's probably a revert, like a kind of a different form of,
1049360	1054240	of not, what do you call it? It's easy to say like, oh, that's a different form of racism,
1054240	1057120	but you can't say that's a different form of homophobia, because you're not phobic,
1057200	1064960	but it's still, it's still dehumanizing to say, I bet gay people are happier than straight people,
1064960	1070240	you're still saying, like, gay, you know, because they're so different, but, you know,
1071440	1078080	because I picture, I picture a gay couple, like, like the gay partner number one comes home and
1078080	1080880	puts their gay face down. Why is one partner number one?
1082160	1084800	Because I didn't want to be like the, I can't be like the gay
1085440	1089040	husband, because that's a good thing we do, is like, well, who's the caboose?
1094080	1098000	I was like, straight people want to like project their stuff, like, which one of you is going to
1098000	1105920	wear the tux? And I had to learn that that's a, that's not a thing that they love. Like, I,
1109440	1112800	it's like the Tatanka thing in Dances with Wolves, like you fucking like listen,
1112800	1116240	and you're going to be wrong about shit, and you try to achieve like, I'm gonna stop you,
1116240	1123280	you're doing this wrong. Right. So, so I, but I always picture, regardless of that,
1124320	1130800	I picture, here's what I picture, how do you picture it? I picture a gay, gay, gay partner
1130800	1140000	number one comes home, puts gay briefcase down, and I'm sorry, gay partner number one comes home
1140000	1145760	and does what? Puts gay briefcase down. Gay brief, hey, why is the gay, why is the briefcase gay?
1145760	1151120	Because they're not a sellout. Because they didn't let their job define them, because they're,
1151120	1154160	because when they go to work, it's with a gay briefcase. More on that later, okay?
1155280	1159600	That's about personal fulfillment. Like, I'm talking about couple necessarily. We're coming
1159600	1166800	back to briefcase identity. Right. They put their briefcase down, and then the gay couple, gay
1166800	1175680	participant in gay couple number two, is in bed doing a crossword and and says, how was your day?
1175680	1181200	And, and the answer is, you know, it was and they and they rattle off like a bunch of things that
1181200	1186560	make your day neutral. Oh, Gary at work, still, still doing the thing where he calls my briefcase
1186560	1195440	gay and Dan keeps trying to prove he's not homophobic by asking those questions about
1195440	1201120	who wore the tux at the wedding. And instead, and all these things. And then and then they go,
1201120	1204560	yeah, it was a hard thing. And it was like, like, and then they and then I just picture them going,
1204560	1210880	like, but I know one thing for sure. I love you. And then, you know, it's probably an internal
1210880	1215920	process, not an external one. But I picture inside their brains, I'm going like, I, I'm able to
1215920	1224640	believe that more than the average straight person because this isn't fucking sanctioned.
1224640	1233280	It's it was more difficult to get here. It was harder to like, it like there's there's already
1233280	1240880	friction in just getting here about myself. And then I found you. And then the two of us are
1240880	1246480	together. And that who knows who approved of that or not. But in any case, boy, when we wake
1246480	1252720	up in the morning, we really have to ask ourselves, do I want to do this? And if we and if we fucking
1252720	1259120	stop wanting it, Newtonian physics will fucking fling it apart, like our parents will pay us.
1259920	1268240	Like, like, they'll be like, Thank God you're straight. I knew it. Like, like, all of that,
1268240	1273600	like, you know, it's like, like, so that's probably all that's an example of how you can
1273600	1279520	have the you can be an advocate, you can be a supporter, and you can still be, you know,
1279520	1285600	part of the problem. Because, because I'm thinking of these people as a different species, I'm
1285600	1291760	thinking of them as, oh, Marvel or versus DC or something like, like, I bet they have green
1291760	1299120	lantern meetings where they can make parties out of as long as they're not yellow. I just
1299120	1305680	can't believe that you that you think of briefcases as being binary. Yeah. You know, you guys know
1305680	1313280	what I'm picturing when I say straight briefcase. No, no, no, we don't. And don't know you. You
1313280	1317920	fucking tell me what you think of when you think of straight briefcase. You know, a fucking goose
1317920	1326160	stepping brown ass fucking thing with the dial code and the fucking combinations your birthday
1326160	1334080	because your fucking cisgender heteronormative piece of shit. And who cares about the codes
1334080	1338400	probably one, two, three, four, because you know what's in there a bunch of fucking pictures of
1338400	1355840	the opposite sex naked. Yawn. Good save. Good save. I don't need, I don't need saves. I'm fucking
1355840	1362400	honest. You can't say I'm fucking lampooning myself. I'm delightful. You are delightful.
1362400	1366720	I'm not, I just serve the right to remain. There is no such thing as a save when you're a Harlem
1366720	1372080	globetrotter. Like, like, like my job isn't to beat the Washington generals. It's not real
1372080	1381280	basketball. I'll fucking like, I got a bucket of confetti in my shorts. It's about being fucking
1381280	1389040	real. Prove it. Prove it. You have to subscribe to see that I really did it. Yeah. For five
1389040	1396000	dollars a month, he didn't have any confetti in his shorts. Yeah. So anyways, I don't know. Yeah.
1396000	1400960	I just like that conversation with my friend. Thank God I have a friend who's like pushing
1400960	1405760	Jordan Peterson out because that makes me actually explore myself and go, well, if I don't,
1405760	1410080	if I don't stay on this schedule of I promise to listen to him tomorrow, it's probably because
1410080	1413840	I've actually made a decision in my life I should acknowledge, which is that I'm a little more
1413840	1420960	interested in boning up on how to function. Like I'm more interested in how to let people know
1420960	1426800	that despite the shape of my face, the placement of my eyebrows, the, the, the Google auto
1428000	1432960	conclusions of my name, um, the, the, the, the everything that you may have heard about me,
1432960	1440480	that actually I am very interested in you being comfortable with me. Uh, and, and that that's
1440480	1445280	actually like, if you see me outside of my house, it's because I chose to leave the house and that
1445280	1449680	while I'm outside the house, I actually regarded as a shared world with you and that I would like
1449680	1455200	to make sure that you don't leave the conversation frowning, even if you're crazy, like, like, like,
1455200	1460720	like, because one out of 10 people is like, well, we can't fucking let them shape our opinions of
1460720	1465120	strangers. Like, like, what if, you know, like, like, like, how guarded are we going to be against
1467120	1471920	Mark David Chapman's, you know, like, like, like, like at the expense of like not meeting more
1471920	1482000	novas or, or, or, or Jean, Jean cooks or, or, or, or Spencer's or, or this guy, uh, Jeff Davis,
1482880	1486240	who's just mad because his briefcase is straight. That's all you're mad about.
1488960	1495200	I have a trans briefcase. All right. It's very functional. Would you, would you describe it?
1495200	1507200	Oh, shit. Got him. Got him. Uh, mail him. I'm gonna pour myself a drink while you describe your
1507200	1519600	trans briefcase. Uh, its name is Tamara and, uh, it holds, uh, folders and pens. It's got a little
1519600	1528240	pouch that, uh, I, I usually put like the book I'm reading in and, uh, it enjoys being a briefcase.
1528800	1536560	That's great. Hey, can I just, I talked to this, uh, person who may have been, uh, crazy at a point
1536560	1541680	pretty recently and, uh, not too far from here, actually. It was like off of Wilshire or whatever.
1541680	1547680	There is a guy that I, I locked my car in a parking garage and so I had to get an Uber
1547680	1553440	away, um, to my house and then I took it back in the morning and he was there both times and at
1553440	1556800	night I wanted to give him money, but I didn't have it. So in the morning I came back and gave him
1556800	1562240	money and then we were talking and he was like, um, he was like, you know, all the, I used to be a
1562240	1566560	chiropractor. All these chiropractors are quacks, man. All these chiropractors are getting put into
1566560	1569840	jail because they're killing people. They're breaking their carotid arteries when they're
1569840	1576000	giving adjustments, man. Um, I knew it. Um, I wrote the book on, uh, chiropractor, you know me,
1576000	1580960	my name is dr. John chiropractor. And he was like, is he rapping? Is he a rapper? No, no.
1581600	1589680	He was like, he is like, he really had a pretty tight whatever what I mean, uh, cadence. Um,
1589680	1593840	and so like he was just going on, but it was like, at first it was like, you know,
1593840	1598400	I used to be a chiropractor on hard times and I was like, oh, crazy. And then, um, then he was
1598400	1602400	like, yeah, you know, all these chiropractors are killing their patients and stuff. And I was like,
1602400	1607360	well, why do you, why are you talking about that? Like that's, I don't, you know, I don't
1607360	1611920	have any intersection with chiropractors other than you right now. They kill people. Did he ever
1611920	1617360	get a, was he like, so anyways, I'm not licensed, but you look like your back hurts and I promise
1617360	1622240	I won't break your carotid artery. No, no, it was none of that. He wasn't, he wasn't, uh,
1622240	1627120	trying to do anything. We were just talking, you know, I'm sure he just wanted to say what's up.
1627120	1634480	I sat next to a guy at El Cholo. Is that the name of the, yeah. You know, it is. Yeah.
1637760	1641360	And I chose, there were, there were, these available at the bar, but there was a,
1641360	1649840	a fella at the bar who was wrapped in an American flag and had a cowboy hat on. Uh, and he was a,
1649840	1654480	he was a little guy and, uh, and he was like eating tortilla soup. Like it was like,
1654480	1658880	fuck the last, like, like, like it had oxygen in it and he was on Mars.
1661600	1665440	And I was like, oh, I know where I'm sitting and I know what I'm ordering and, uh,
1669840	1676720	and I sat down next to him and when I did, he was like, what's up? Yeah. Like, like this kind of,
1676720	1683200	like challenging, like, like, like, yeah, I'm wrapped in an American flag. Right. Yeah. And I,
1683200	1690960	and I, I was like, nothing. How are you? And he's like, good. And then he went back to his soup.
1690960	1696000	Damn. And then I was, I just sat there and I was like, this is great. Yeah. Because I proved that
1696000	1705200	I'm not judgmental and I don't have to talk to him to prove it. Yeah. He's, I sat next to the
1705200	1708800	exact right person because I sat next to everybody else. Who knows where they'd be like,
1708800	1715440	I'm a dentist. How are you? Oh, people misjudged the value of the tooth. Um, but maybe, I don't
1715440	1720000	know. It's just a word of advice. Maybe that person that you look at and go, uh, oh, a tinfoil robot.
1720000	1725360	Um, maybe, maybe, maybe they're like, they're wearing that because they're like, try me. And
1725360	1730080	then you simply not trying them makes you the best person they've ever met. He was literally wrapped
1730080	1737040	in a, in just an actual flag. Not like a cape. Not a garment that was made to be a garment. Just,
1737040	1744720	just a cape. No, it's cheaper that way. Right. And so this was like, uh, if you pressed X to diffuse
1744720	1750480	the situation kind of in right there. And then it's like, it's plus honor, you know, you really
1750480	1760640	won. This is El Cholo in Los Angeles. Uh, this was the one that is right. That's what I'm talking
1760640	1766000	about. You remember that guy, right? Levi was there. Wait, is that Levi talking shit back there?
1766000	1770560	When was this? Levi was with me. We were meeting my agent. So you were with Levi.
1770560	1774160	Yeah, I'm always with Levi. Don't, don't, don't bury the Levi.
1774160	1783360	Yeah. That's a bad journal. Do you guys remember a song? Do you remember a song? I do.
1785440	1793280	No, Jeff, don't. I remember loads of songs. Are you thinking of one in particular? Yes. Okay.
1793280	1798400	It is, it is, it is from the 1970s. It's by a guy named, I think his name is
1799200	1804560	uh, wait, I'm going to look it up real quick because I want, because the worst thing I could do
1806560	1807600	his name is car.
1811600	1816960	I'm so tired. Oh yeah. Yeah. I was in Las Vegas for a day and a half and that really takes it out of
1816960	1823120	you. Right. Oh my God. In water. Oh, I forgot this place. We don't really get like the four G's
1823120	1826640	out here. Okay. Here it is. Okay. You want to plug into the thing? It's, it's by a guy. No,
1826720	1830400	I don't want to, I don't want to make Kevin day freak out about copyright. Like I don't want to
1830960	1837520	play a song. Kevin, Kevin, David's been dead for days. It's by a guy. It's a 1970s song.
1837520	1842560	It's by a guy named Clarence Carter. Uh, it's called, it's called stroken. Yeah.
1844560	1845440	Oh yeah.
1847840	1851440	Dave Klein, Dave Klein has lost his goddamn mind in the front row.
1851440	1857200	It was stroken. Yeah. Stroken's fucking weird, man. Here's the thing.
1858240	1862480	Dave Klein, would you please keep your fucking act together? It was a Colombian. I've never,
1862480	1867520	I've never seen somebody. I was, I'm, I'm, I'm dating a, I'm dating a young lady, uh,
1867520	1871200	12 years younger than me. And there's a lot, and she's a valley girl. There's a lot of things that
1871200	1876960	she does. Like, like, like, I, I can't tell him. So every, every person we watch every Christmas,
1877840	1882560	right. Uh, every Christmas we've tried, I think we figured out yesterday that we do this every
1882560	1886240	Christmas, but we never remember because we're drunk and we try to watch all the Die Hard movies.
1886240	1892000	And, uh, and I think every, it's a groundhog day. Like I'm always like, you've never seen Die Hard?
1892000	1897120	No. Like, well you got to see the sequel. It's really uncomfortable. And I was like, okay,
1897120	1902560	let's watch all of them. Okay. The third one gets kind of amazing because it's so intensely racially
1902560	1908720	aware. Um, and, and, and, uh, and, and, and, and then we always have, but then we started noticing
1908720	1913040	because it's like, it comes up and it says resume playing and it's right at the end. Like, we've
1913040	1920080	done this before. We've watched all the Die Hards. We always fall asleep before, uh, uh, the first,
1920640	1925840	Simon says booby trap in the fountain. Remember when you and me and Schwab and Chris Tomlin tried
1925840	1930320	to watch all the Hellraisers and we fucking just gave up. Damn, there's seven of them. There's
1930320	1937280	almost seven Die Hards now. For real? Yeah. There's like five, there might, is there six there? I know
1937280	1941840	there's what you're raising your, oh, you're, you're holding up the number five. I thought you were
1941840	1951600	like, like, can I come up? Cause there's 11 and I got a degree in Die Hard at Columbia. Um, anyways,
1951600	1955520	so the song's called smoke. The reason I thought we're listening to true crime podcasts. So there
1955520	1959040	were these a couple of months, all the true crime podcasts, like all said the same thing a couple
1959040	1966160	months ago, uh, there was this family. They, uh, they, they, uh, a 17 year old girl escaped from
1966160	1973440	the family. She called 911, uh, and, and the cop showed up and she said, my, my siblings have been
1973440	1978720	imprisoned for fucking 20 years in our house. It was like, you might remember that it was like this
1979360	1985680	news item about this, this family that kept all 13 of their kids like chained to their beds for
1985680	1992320	like forever. And some of them were in their twenties because you can't have like, uh, that
1992320	1997040	many kids without some of them being in their twenties. Uh, like, like it takes like up to nine
1997040	2003280	months to make each one. And, uh, the life fallow once every three years. Uh, so, so, so they, they
2003280	2008000	just had like, so they had full grown adults who were like malnourished and, and, and anyways,
2008000	2012160	the families, the last name is the Terpins and we're like, holy shit, what's up with these Terpins?
2012160	2015040	And then I just started, you know, we're feeding the dogs and we're just kind of high and I'm like,
2015120	2022000	I've been Terpin. Uh, and Cody's laughing and I'm like doing this. Oh, I've been Terpin. Oh, yeah.
2022800	2027280	You know, I've been Terpin. Uh, and she's like, what is that song? And I'm like, I think it's like,
2027280	2030960	what is it? I've been smoking. I'm smoking. What is that song? And I was like, is it, I believe in
2030960	2036320	miracles. What is it? It's really clever. And then I find it, it's called stroking. What is this
2036320	2042160	song? Stroken. I agree. Before you even play it, this song is fucking strange. It is so fucking
2042160	2048960	weird for the weirdest reasons. Is it about fucking or sucking or stroking? Or I don't know.
2048960	2054320	That's part of the twist. Is it, is that, so I don't think, I don't think I'm allowed to play it.
2054320	2060080	I don't think I play it. Who gives a fuck? Is stroking going to sue us? Well, we could always
2060080	2066720	delete it later. If I assume, like, if I say like, how about this? Like, I mean, I play it. Like,
2066720	2072480	what is it? It costs like 35 grand to like buy like a Sara Bareilles song. But we can delete it
2072480	2076560	at any time if we want to. We can just not put it on the internet. We can delete it tomorrow before
2076560	2082960	it drops. It's fine to play it as a live performance in this room. That I know. Right, right, right,
2082960	2089200	right. But if you don't want it to exist forever, we might have to drop it and just talk about it.
2089200	2093760	Yeah. I do think it's valuable to just, I think it's important. But we could bleep it and tell
2093760	2100960	them go online and listen to it online. Well, I type because these folks, they can't do that.
2100960	2108080	That would be rude to the show. We're kind of a lot of like, younger people in the audience that,
2108080	2112720	you know, they're like, they have no frame of reference. Oh, here it is. He strokes to the right
2112720	2117920	one point. Yeah. He's, uh, stroking is just something that I'll be doing tonight. Like,
2117920	2123440	yeah, it goes into stroking. Is that something that are we doing tonight? Is that what he said?
2123440	2128960	More or less. He, I know he stroke it to the left. I'm pretty sure he strokes it to the right.
2128960	2134160	How could you not? Because I'm a, I'm a Libra. So you got to stroke it to the left and stroke it to
2134160	2138880	the right. Cause I'm about, I'm about balanced. The signal's really weak in here. I think I'm
2138880	2142400	going to, I'm going to bail on the plan. Play the fucking song. No, I'm going to, I'm just,
2142400	2147440	just said the opposite. Right. So if you take the opposite point of view, then what you're doing is
2147520	2153600	you're just putting the brakes. I know it. Knowing it isn't, I'm not.
2156080	2161680	Hey, I know it too. God, if only someone knew the, I have the lyrics written down. I don't
2161680	2169120	need someone to know them. Okay. So, so he, he, he, he says, well, this is great. We don't have
2169120	2176560	that in anything. Right. And they'll Google it anyway. So he says, he, he, he, he's the protagonist
2176640	2181280	offensively, right? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, it's, it's not about Dracula.
2183920	2189200	He, he says, I, it's the first person he never says in the song, by the way, I've been Dracula
2189200	2193760	this whole time. Oh, I know. And quite frankly, actually toward the end, he, in a very smart
2193760	2199120	branding move, he has a woman cry out his name many, many, Oh, okay. It started playing. So whatever.
2199840	2204640	All right. Oh, wait. Sorry. Hold on. Sorry.
2205920	2210000	If you've ever made love just before breakfast. That was,
2213280	2214560	that's part way into the song. So
2230080	2235840	Okay. So, so I want to stop it there. When I start making love, I don't just make love.
2235840	2243280	I'd be stroken. Right. So now I'm going to ask the question later, what does he think we're going
2243280	2249680	to think he means? And what could he possibly mean if he doesn't mean, and I have, I have,
2249680	2257920	I am the last person to shame him for this because I literally be stroken during making love in a
2257920	2264720	variety of ways. Like I'm very happy to involve self pleasure in a weird intersectionality with
2264720	2273280	fucking like sex is a journey, not a destination. Right. It's that you fucking hang out with
2273280	2278080	somebody. It's a thing you do for a while. And when it stops, it stops. And whoever's stroking
2278560	2288160	you have been, you have been stroking in your own, in your own, whatever. Yeah. It's like,
2288160	2291840	like my therapist said to me at one point, she's like, you know, you're going to be in a relationship
2291840	2296880	one day where you're going to feel like masturbating while you're playing a video game and your
2296880	2302080	girlfriend's going to be in the same building. And you're going to think I'm going to go find her
2302080	2311840	and make it her problem as a path of least resistance. And I was like, that's not true.
2311840	2315120	That's not how monogamy ends up working. Like, come on, we tug one out while they're in the
2315120	2318320	shower and we, because we don't want to like have conversations about blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's
2318320	2321360	like, no, that's all about shame and all this stuff. It was like, sure enough. It was like,
2321360	2327040	goddamn, I'm horny. Knowing that there's no shame in me being able to just fucking start stroking.
2328000	2334640	And Cody can either be fine with that or like, it's not about getting caught doing it,
2334640	2340080	trying not to wake them up. It's just like, dick's hard, stroke, stroke, stroke. And then like,
2340080	2344480	and like, cause she'll do it too. It's like, we'll be watching Superman too. And she'll be like,
2344480	2347120	ha ha. And I'll be like, what, did you fart? And she goes, no, I came.
2349920	2353920	I'm like, you just masturbated? And she's like, yeah, I'm the fucking master. And I'm like,
2353920	2359760	this bitch is amazing. And I'm off the hook forever. Like, that is what you need as a
2359760	2365680	partner. During Superman two, Dick Donner got fired off that movie. She still came.
2368960	2372640	So she'd be struck and you'd be struck. Anyways, I'm not judging the guy. I'm just saying like the
2372640	2376560	guy that's what he's leading with. I'm just saying like, I think we've already in the first
2376560	2382160	three, like lyrics, we've crossed a threshold into his world. Right. And it's already weird.
2382160	2387360	Like he's, he's presenting it as weird. He goes, when I'm making love, I'm not just making love.
2387360	2397520	I'm also stroking. And I'm like, okay. Maybe he has like oxygen lost to his brain.
2398560	2400080	Tell me more, Clarence Carter.
2400080	2411040	That's cool. He's stroking it to her.
2412640	2418000	This is your rap. Okay. Now he, now let me ask you something.
2430800	2440480	Okay. This list start better start getting way more fucking adventurous
2441680	2446240	because so far you're literally listing the most common times for lovemaking.
2447600	2454480	But guess what? He's just going to run down a list of the laziest ways to make love,
2454960	2460560	but he's challenging, he's chesting up on the listener. He's good. There's a couple more items
2460560	2467440	and he gets increasingly defiant. Like what about this? And every time it gets more, more common.
2468880	2471920	I just wanted to have you ever made love during a lunar eclipse.
2473760	2475920	Have you ever made love at lovers lane?
2484480	2505760	Okay. It's in, not on. Are you, are you the Munsters on the back seat? Do you drive an X
2505760	2511760	caliber? Are you, are you on a plow? This record's called bucket list.
2512000	2517200	A bucket list for, for, for De Niro's character and awakenings.
2518160	2525840	Like, like, like too soon for... Have you ever made love casting a tennis ball with your right hand?
2527440	2533440	Have you ever made love when you were 17 and it was uncontrollable? Have,
2533440	2540080	has dry humping ever led to making love? But is he leading to something grander?
2540720	2547200	No, he's leading to a segue. That's, and I'm like, like, how did this song become a weird
2548000	2553120	neurotypical challenge? Have you ever made love when you're drunk?
2553120	2558560	What does he imagine? What does he imagine is the other side of that? Are they saying,
2558560	2563440	well, no, that's very cool. Please continue. I think he must be only talking to his parents
2563440	2568640	who are like, it's a four poster bed or you're going to hell. Or, or are they like saying,
2568720	2573440	yeah, I have. And he's like, well, what about in the backseat of a car? And he's like,
2573440	2575520	yeah, I have. And they're like, well, what about on the moon?
2575520	2579680	Well, I think he's, I think that's what it is. I think he's, because he's about to tell a story
2579680	2584720	about, about the backseat. It's like a segue. Well, it just seems like very much like bragging.
2584720	2588880	And I think he didn't want to leap into... No, he takes it to the bridge. He's like,
2588880	2592880	I'm going to walk you into my world where, hey, look, there's different ways.
2592880	2596000	Sometimes you're in the backseat of a car. The story takes place in the backseat of a car
2596000	2599120	because police are about to be involved. And I don't want you to picture them coming into
2599120	2604880	my bedroom. And so yes, I was in the backseat of a car. And in case you're going to be thrown by
2604880	2611120	that police car. No, he wasn't in a police car. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm just saying, I'm just
2611120	2616480	thinking like, oh, he's just setting, he's, he's, he's inviting us into, into like, have you, hey,
2616480	2620960	hey, he's, he's like being like Kinsey, you know, he's going like, Hey, how fucking straight are you
2620960	2624640	man? When it comes to locations and times where you're making love, you make love all over the
2624640	2629200	place. Don't you? Including the backs of the car. Okay. So fade in on me. He's saying, are you
2629200	2634400	freaky? But he's saying, look, I'm not, I'm not even that freaky. I make love sometimes before
2634400	2640880	breakfast. I make sometimes during the late, late show, sometimes on a couch, sometimes in the back
2640880	2649680	of a car. I'm kind of walking you into my world where I'm a regular person. And I'd be stroking
2649680	2654160	on regular things. When you find out the payoff, you're going to be like, well, why did, why was
2654160	2659040	that plank necessary? Why can't you just jump into a pool of this shallow? Because it's called,
2659040	2664720	it's called verse verse chorus bridge, where they take it to another place and they walk you into
2664720	2668000	across the throat. But I will note this song is breaking all the rules right away. Because the
2668000	2673200	only other song that does this to my glee is Eric Clapton's it's on the way that you use it. Like
2673200	2680480	notice he just, it just starts like, Hey, make it loud. I've been stroking. Like, he doesn't even
2680480	2684080	like, there's no verse. It's not like, uh, you know, I'm going to tell you about the wild thing
2684080	2688800	for a while. And then wild thing. It's like he kind of like gets into it. Take this. Okay.
2688800	2691360	Take us to the bridge. Take us to the bridge. All right. Here we go.
2705360	2709680	Okay. So I just want to speak on behalf of the police there in that situation and say
2709680	2717200	still the same charges apply, sir. I don't know if you're, if you're speaking in terms of legal
2717200	2723760	jurisprudence, but our job is to put your dick back in your pants because your car is a place
2723760	2729280	where police can see it. But when he goes to court, I guarantee you his defense is going to be, uh,
2729920	2734560	define what stroking is. And that's the twist that's coming. And it's coming, it's coming
2734560	2739280	unintentionally because, and I don't know if it's intentional. I don't think it's intentional because
2739280	2744160	there's another twist in the song that is intentional. Um, the one that's unintentional
2744160	2749680	is that he finally will use stroking with as a verb with a subject. I don't know if it's the
2749680	2754800	correct term as object or subject, but that there's a, that he'll, he'll say what he's stroking.
2755680	2761120	And, and I'm like, Oh, you should lead with that or not be confused about the ambiguous response.
2761120	2764080	Because Chuck Berry would open with whatever he was stroking.
2764080	2768560	Right. So that then he can play the game of like, I've got a little bell and I call it
2768560	2773520	a dingaling. Now let's play fucking salted, salted nuts or whatever the SNL sketch is
2774320	2780080	not comedically sophisticated that sketch. Oh, he's back for an eighth time. Salty balls. What
2780080	2786720	the fuck? This is like a 1950s joke. Okay. So, um, just to me, that line that we just heard
2786720	2791600	changes, changes the meaning of the past lines because he's saying all this stuff and it sounds
2791600	2796880	braggartly, but now he's telling this story. And so it recontextualizes the early lines such that
2796880	2802160	it sounds like he's saying he's trying to come up with a way to relate to you. He's like, Oh,
2802160	2808400	you ever have sex on a, on a, on a couch? No, no. Uh, well, what about in the backseat of the car?
2808400	2814240	Okay. Okay. Well, I was having sex on the back seat of the car and a guy came up. And so,
2814240	2818000	so remember I said earlier that I was stroking. Well, that was just like this one time while I
2818000	2821520	was having sex in the back of the car. And this guy comes up to me and he says, what are you doing?
2821520	2825600	I'm going to, I've been stroking, you know, and now he's about to continue to explain this stuff.
2825600	2828960	Yeah. It's also notable though, that I don't think the cops said, what are you doing? I think
2828960	2835520	he just shines the light and he goes, I'm stroking. Guilty conscious, guilty conscious. Can you go back
2835520	2840160	and play that previous line? Okay. I think it's important that we go back and recontextualize.
2840160	2843040	This guy is endeavoring to explain something serious.
2855600	2861840	Backseat of the car. And the police came and shine this light on me. And I said, I'm stroking.
2862640	2866000	All right. That's what I'm doing. I'll be stroking.
2873040	2873680	By the way, ouch.
2880160	2882880	I'm not sure my dick has an east on the left. Okay.
2885600	2890320	How long has it been since you made love?
2893760	2894880	It's important to find out.
2898240	2899200	I don't remember this part.
2904240	2907600	He needs to get a baseline. Are you making love tomorrow?
2908640	2911680	It's important for this next part. I'm about to explain.
2915600	2925600	It might be that you planning on making love, but just remember when you start making love,
2927440	2932960	you're making hard, long, soft, short, and be stroking.
2934480	2938560	Okay. That seemed like a stall beat. That was just like...
2938560	2941120	He said make it hard, long, soft, and short.
2941120	2945520	Yeah. Make it paradoxical is his point. Sex should be fucking challenging.
2946160	2950640	Make it for... But here comes the thing that I consider to twist.
2950640	2953840	It's going to be really subtle, and I'll have to... Okay.
2975520	2979840	That's smart branding.
2984960	2988400	Okay. The other night I was stroking my woman.
2988400	2989200	Okay. So now he's stroking.
2989200	2991520	So he was never talking about his cock.
2991520	2992160	Yeah. He's talking about...
2992160	2996800	He's talking about being sensual. So now it makes sense that the cops come up and shine the light,
2996800	3001360	and he goes, I'm fucking stroking, man. I have a civil right to do so.
3001360	3002480	It's a stroke.
3002560	3005680	I'm fucking touching someone's skin in a way that...
3005680	3010800	No, no. He's talking about putting... He's talking about the stroke of the in and out of the thing.
3010800	3014240	He just said stroking my woman. Oh, you're saying you could use that,
3014240	3018800	and it becomes kind of like stroking my woman means putting, penetrating her?
3018800	3020800	I think he's talking about fucking...
3020800	3026960	Well, and I would say also in contrast to my theory there, where I was like,
3026960	3031360	oh, wait. The joke's on me for thinking he was talking about stroking his penis,
3032000	3039760	but in his refrain, he says, I stroke it to the woman that I like best, which means not...
3042480	3047760	What are you stroking when you're stroking to something? You can't be stroking a piano to...
3047760	3050640	Yeah. It's not an intransitive verb.
3052880	3057360	So, all right. Well, so I thought that was the twist, but his twist is just profane.
3057360	3063600	And it got so good to her. You know what she told me. Let me tell you what she told me.
3065600	3070320	She said, stroke and cleanse, Carter. But don't stroke so fast.
3071120	3075920	If my stuff ain't tight enough, you can stick me down, man. Well, I'll be stronger.
3075920	3078560	Okay. Well, damn.
3080320	3082160	Is that a problem? She was anticipating.
3082960	3084080	The defense rests.
3087680	3091040	Yeah. I mean, the case closed.
3092160	3092880	If it's not...
3092880	3096640	He's talking about fucking... He's talking about fucking a pussy. And then he goes, oh,
3096640	3099520	also if her stuff is too tight...
3099520	3102160	If it's too tight, how is your ass looser?
3104480	3107680	What kind of woman are you bringing home with you, Clarence Carter?
3108560	3112080	If my vagina's too tight, there's always my ass.
3112080	3117040	But then he chooses that moment to get demure and not say the word ass.
3117600	3121040	I know. Well, because he's... That's the one thing that I'm saying. I'm thinking like,
3121040	3125840	you know what she said to me. He just sings the rest of it and then he finishes the song.
3125840	3131200	But he might be thinking like, you know what? And then I stop dating her because I'm not doing that.
3132480	3138320	Well, I be stroking. I mean, like a neck rub. I like to cuddle.
3139200	3142080	But that's not the case. Anyways, well, that's the song, stroking.
3143040	3149280	It's just good that he... When he gave that story, it's good that he found out how often we have sex
3149280	3154240	and whether or not we've done it on a couch. Otherwise, how could we possibly have understood
3154880	3157520	that when her stuff is too tight, we could do it there?
3159200	3160720	When it's called...
3160720	3162800	It wouldn't make any sense with all that buildup.
3163360	3166000	It's called accusing the accuser. Oh, well,
3166000	3167760	because last time you had sex in a couch.
3167760	3170640	Right. I didn't say you weren't stroking, buddy.
3171280	3173920	Oh, really? When was the last time you had sex?
3173920	3175680	I'm not saying you didn't.
3175680	3176560	Was it last night?
3177360	3178480	That's not relevant.
3180960	3183760	How is that a way to respond to police shining a light on you?
3184400	3186640	I guess he's saying, like, you got a fucking problem.
3186640	3189760	I'm stroking. Like, it's just him being defiant. He's going like,
3189760	3191360	why don't you take a picture in the last locker?
3192080	3195440	I'm fucking stroking. I'm not stealing. I'm not fucking...
3196320	3198800	I'm not violating a free speech zone.
3198800	3200720	You very understandably took it to a place
3200720	3203120	where if a guy starts talking about I'd be stroking,
3203120	3205040	it sounds like he's masturbating.
3205040	3206720	It turns out, no, he's...
3206720	3207120	He just...
3207120	3209360	He wants anal sex and is not getting it
3209360	3211360	because the police are on his fucking ass.
3211360	3213360	But also, like, is he just describing...
3213360	3214720	He's just describing the...
3214720	3216080	And I'm making love, I don't...
3216080	3217600	It's not just making love.
3217600	3219200	I have a special name for it.
3219200	3220640	Oh, yeah. That's not a name.
3220640	3223040	Because I do it differently. I do it better.
3223680	3224880	What is your special name, Dan?
3225680	3227040	I'm stroking. I call it stroking.
3227520	3229680	So, I'm not gonna call it making love
3229680	3231760	because you're a fucking plebe, okay?
3232800	3236400	You make love like a fucking barn animal or a priest.
3238240	3240320	I'm a fucking hero when I make love.
3240320	3243280	I'm a trademarkable fucking, like, brandy...
3243280	3244720	Wait, sir, sir.
3244720	3245280	What?
3245280	3246640	I'm shining my light on you.
3246640	3247360	I'm stroking.
3247360	3247920	Why is there a...
3250560	3253120	Why is there a compass on your penis right now?
3253120	3253600	Big wall...
3258000	3260080	I have to ask this as a police officer.
3260080	3262640	And I have to answer as a stroker.
3265040	3267520	By asking my question, you've already answered
3267520	3269360	some of my questions that I'll be asking later.
3269360	3271120	First, number one, have you ever stroked?
3271120	3272080	Because you clearly haven't.
3272080	3273280	I've never seen a compass.
3273280	3277440	I've seen loads of things in my 15 years as a law enforcement officer.
3277440	3279920	Ask this guy if he's ever done it on a couch.
3281600	3282160	Hey.
3282160	3283600	Thank you, Emily. I will.
3285120	3285680	Officer.
3287280	3288560	Have you ever made love...
3288560	3290240	Hey, this will come into play later.
3290240	3290480	Of course.
3290480	3291440	What time have you made love?
3291440	3292800	Answer my question.
3292800	3294640	Answer mine. I pay your salary.
3294640	3295840	What time have you made love?
3296560	3298400	Ask him if he's placed on a vacant love tonight.
3298400	3299280	Before breakfast?
3299280	3300480	Have you made love before breakfast?
3300480	3301360	Of course, before breakfast.
3301360	3302320	Okay, well, let me ask you this.
3303760	3305440	Have you done it during the late late show?
3305440	3306400	Why... Sir.
3307120	3310400	Sir, why is there a compass on your penis?
3310400	3310960	Pin it with it.
3312400	3312880	Because...
3314080	3315440	I stroke it to the east.
3315440	3317120	Oh.
3317120	3318080	I stroke it to the west.
3318080	3320240	Okay, so you can tell.
3320240	3323520	And I stroke it to the woman that I love best.
3323520	3324400	Okay, I might ask you...
3324400	3325840	And that's what your flashlight is fucking penetrating.
3325840	3327360	I'm not saying you're a bad person.
3327360	3330160	I'm saying that this is a residential community
3330160	3333440	where there are strict rules about people making love in their automobiles.
3333440	3335120	Oh, well, do people live here?
3335120	3335600	Yes.
3335600	3337200	Well, do they live?
3338640	3339680	Or do I live?
3339680	3340400	Okay, wait, now...
3341200	3343120	And am I not more alive than them?
3343120	3345040	Who are you, fucking Camus?
3345120	3346880	I'm a fucking law officer.
3346880	3348240	No, never heard of them.
3348240	3349440	Too busy stroking.
3349440	3349680	Well...
3350480	3352080	Dropped out of high school to stroke.
3352080	3352560	Wait, wait, you...
3353680	3354480	No law against it.
3354480	3356080	You're stroking what?
3356640	3358560	The woman to her.
3358560	3359600	And also her.
3361040	3362720	But that's not how verbs work.
3362720	3364240	You can't stroke to...
3364240	3366880	We didn't ask enough leading questions.
3368240	3371360	I just want to know how...
3371360	3373440	How do you put a compass on your dick in the first place?
3374400	3377200	You're so bad at geography that you can't just look at the moon
3377200	3379760	and know when you're fucking to the east or the west
3379760	3380960	that you have to have a compass on your dick.
3380960	3382480	What kind of pagan shit is this?
3384880	3387680	If you're going to arrest me, am I under arrest?
3389120	3389680	Thank you.
3389680	3391040	You are not being detained.
3391040	3394560	Okay, because everything you say right now can be used against you.
3395680	3396960	I got your badge number.
3396960	3398640	You're talking about moon fucking?
3398640	3399520	Step out of the car.
3399520	3400160	Step out of the car.
3400160	3400960	Gladly, all right.
3400960	3402080	Step out of the car.
3402080	3404240	You might want to step to the west a little bit.
3405520	3408560	Because I was on that stroke when you fucking interrupted me
3408560	3409600	with your fascist fucking...
3409600	3411200	Are you about to be stroking me?
3411200	3412400	Well, no, I'm just saying.
3412400	3414480	Like, I'm mid-stroke and I was...
3414480	3416960	Sir, if you threaten to stroke an officer, that's...
3416960	3418240	I'm not going to stroke you.
3418240	3419920	I stroke the people I love best.
3419920	3420960	And I'm fucking like...
3421840	3423600	Who might fucking chop liver?
3423600	3424880	You don't love me at all?
3424880	3426640	I'm cooperating here.
3426640	3427920	I'm cooperating.
3427920	3428960	There's nobody around.
3428960	3429840	There's nobody around.
3429840	3430480	Oh, that's weird.
3430480	3432000	Then why is it against the law for me to stroke?
3432480	3433840	So you caused the problem.
3433840	3435120	I don't understand.
3435120	3436080	I don't...
3436080	3438160	Nobody knows why you stroke.
3438160	3439520	It sounds like you're jerking officers.
3439520	3441920	Don't you seek me out because you had stroking questions?
3443040	3444560	I was minding my own business.
3446640	3450800	Maybe I've made love every way you could possibly do it.
3450800	3453440	And I want to fucking find out if there's better ways to do it.
3454640	3456000	I asked you some questions.
3456000	3457360	I already know you've never stroked.
3458160	3459840	I don't know what you call it, sir.
3459840	3461440	I throw myself on your mercy.
3462720	3467120	Emily, will you tell him that this is voluntary, consensual,
3467120	3469040	so we can just get in the front seat of the car?
3469040	3470640	Oh, so she has to tell me it's consensual?
3471200	3471680	What?
3471680	3473040	She has to tell me it's consensual.
3473040	3474240	You're going to make her tell me
3474240	3476400	that the stroking was consensual the whole time?
3476400	3477760	I'm not going to make her do anything.
3477760	3480240	I'm going to stroke to her while she talks to you.
3480240	3483120	Nobody knows what that means.
3483120	3484320	It sounds fucking...
3484320	3485520	It sounds horrible.
3485520	3486960	It sounds like an awful thing.
3487600	3489120	Yeah, stroking sounds awful, yeah.
3490160	3491360	This fucking police state.
3492320	3494400	It's like we're through the looking glass, man.
3494400	3496320	Stroking's bad, but you know it's not Vietnam.
3496320	3496800	Don't trade on me.
3496800	3497920	Vietnam's great.
3497920	3498880	Put your hands on the car.
3498880	3499600	Put your hands on the hood.
3499600	3499680	All right, all right.
3499680	3500160	You know what?
3500160	3500480	Put your hands on the hood.
3500480	3501440	I'm not resisting.
3501440	3502480	Put your hands on the hood.
3502480	3504000	I'm not resisting arrest.
3504000	3504640	Give me your right hand.
3504640	3505840	My name is Clarence Carter.
3505840	3506640	I'm stroking.
3506640	3507520	Give me your right hand.
3508320	3509680	Give me your right hand.
3509680	3510240	Not your right.
3510880	3511920	Your right.
3511920	3512720	My east hand?
3512720	3513220	Yes.
3515440	3518480	Now put your west hand back there.
3518480	3518960	Okay.
3518960	3519600	He needs that.
3519600	3522560	And I'm going to put the cuffs on you, sir.
3522560	3523200	All right.
3523200	3524240	And I'm going to be stroking.
3526960	3530880	I'll be stroking to the north, I'll be stroking to the south,
3531520	3535040	stroking to your butt, and stroking to your mouth.
3535040	3535920	I'll be stroking.
3537120	3538640	Are you stroking to the north and south?
3539200	3540240	Yeah, yeah.
3540240	3541680	Also, who's going to believe you?
3541680	3542720	There's no witnesses?
3542720	3543440	I'm great.
3543440	3545760	Look, all I needed to know was that you stroked.
3545760	3547840	I stroked to the north and the south.
3547840	3548320	Fantastic.
3548320	3549680	You stroked to the east and the west.
3549680	3550800	That's why I was freaked out.
3551680	3553200	Look, I walk up in a car.
3553200	3555440	I see somebody stroking east and west.
3555440	3556720	And that's confusing to me.
3557920	3560480	I'm a north-south stroker.
3560480	3561040	I get it.
3561040	3563280	Now, what's your ethnic background?
3563280	3564080	Can I add?
3564080	3564960	Are you Norwegian?
3564960	3565760	I'm Portuguese.
3565760	3566720	It makes sense, though.
3566720	3568640	Because it goes by ley lines, I've heard.
3568640	3569040	Portuguese, yeah, yeah.
3570720	3572640	My family's from the Azores, and we're right on the-
3572640	3573680	That makes total sense.
3573680	3574880	I'm not trying to be racist.
3574880	3577600	I'm African American myself, but what I've been told is that
3577600	3578480	there's different-
3578480	3580800	It goes by magnetic ley lines.
3580800	3582560	Okay, I'm going to uncuff you.
3582560	3583760	Oh, thank you so much.
3583760	3586400	I'll just give you a warning on this one.
3586400	3589760	Keep it to the north and south next time if you're going to be stroking.
3589760	3590400	Well, okay.
3590400	3591600	I mean, I don't see why-
3592160	3592640	I'm not going to-
3592640	3592880	You know what?
3592880	3593360	I'm not going to-
3596960	3598720	I don't understand why that has to be a rule
3598720	3600080	just because that's how you stroked.
3600080	3602720	You stroked east and west.
3602720	3604560	You want to go up and down.
3605600	3607440	North and south seems like a hard-
3607600	3608880	You'd be stroking, huh?
3610880	3611680	I get it now.
3614880	3617680	I get what it's like to be pontificated to about stroking.
3617680	3619040	Can I be honest with you?
3619920	3621440	Can I give you one secret?
3621440	3621920	Yeah.
3621920	3625360	And look, can we walk away from the car so Emily doesn't hear us?
3627840	3629920	I've never actually had sex before breakfast.
3629920	3630400	Wow.
3632160	3633360	Well, it's like a bingo card.
3633360	3634480	Eventually, everybody fills it.
3634560	3640560	It's not about what I'm trying to impart when I was grilling you about that.
3640560	3642400	It wasn't like, oh, do you do it?
3643520	3643760	Right.
3643760	3649920	I was just saying, can we share the fact that we've stroked?
3649920	3650240	All right.
3650240	3650800	Anyways, all right.
3652560	3653040	Sorry.
3653040	3654480	I'll let you go with the warning.
3656240	3657200	Get out of here.
3657200	3658240	Drive home safely.
3659600	3663200	And look, I got to tell you, if I ever see up here again,
3664000	3666400	like just keep it rolling.
3667200	3667760	Move along.
3668640	3669680	Because I have a job to do.
3669680	3670560	You've got a job to do.
3671600	3672080	What do you do?
3672720	3673440	How do you make a living?
3674480	3675760	I'm a motivational speaker.
3680400	3681040	Really?
3681040	3681360	Yeah.
3681360	3684000	Mostly colleges and stuff like that.
3684000	3685600	Because I suffer from severe depression.
3686160	3688480	Oh, well, let me ask you this.
3688480	3690080	Well, I already know the answer to what I was going to ask.
3690080	3695200	Well, don't diminish me by thinking that you already know the answers to my answer.
3695200	3701280	Well, you know, when I eat, I don't just eat.
3701280	3702480	Because you've already had sex, because it's breakfast.
3702480	3703200	I be gluten.
3704800	3705840	You eat gluten.
3705840	3706960	Yeah, I be gluten.
3707840	3710160	Yeah, I glute to the east.
3711680	3714800	Let me ask you, when you eat, do you ever eat before breakfast?
3716880	3719360	Wait, I do eat on the couch.
3720080	3723200	The only time I'm ever happy is eating on the couch.
3723200	3723440	Yeah.
3723440	3726640	And it's probably a bread related product, refined flour, all that stuff.
3726640	3727040	Yeah.
3727040	3727600	I be gluten.
3727600	3728240	You be gluten.
3728240	3729760	Well, then, yeah, me too.
3731040	3734640	Tell him about the time you were gluten on the back seat of the car.
3734640	3735120	Emily.
3736560	3737840	And that cop came up.
3743440	3747440	Has anybody ever, I wonder in the history of like police encounters when like,
3747440	3754000	I wonder if anybody has ever gotten the offer of,
3754000	3760960	I'm going to let you off with a warning and like been like, no, I don't accept your warning.
3763280	3764320	You think that's got to be a thing?
3764320	3766400	Like somebody's like, you don't fucking warn me.
3766400	3768000	You pulled me over for a bullshit reason.
3768000	3769280	I don't accept your warning.
3769280	3771760	And the cop's like, it's just a fucking thing we say when we're letting you go.
3771760	3773600	And it's like, I'm not going to be grateful for being let go.
3774400	3775360	I did that once.
3775360	3776880	Yeah, I'm sure that happens.
3777040	3777840	Fuck your warning.
3777840	3778480	The guy goes, all right.
3780320	3781120	I'm warning you.
3781120	3782640	I'm letting you off with a warning.
3782640	3784320	Don't fucking pull me over ever again.
3784320	3784720	Fucking cop.
3786720	3787920	I had the flu.
3787920	3790400	I was fucking just, I was just rotten sick.
3790400	3794640	And I was going down to the market to get some juice, like some healthy bits.
3794640	3797600	And fucking cop pulled me over because he thought I was on my phone.
3797600	3798960	I wasn't on my phone.
3798960	3802640	And he pulled me over and I was just so fucking pissed off.
3802640	3804560	And they go, all right, you can go.
3805200	3806640	And I went, fuck you.
3806960	3807920	Dude.
3807920	3808480	Dude.
3811120	3812160	He was a rookie guy.
3812160	3814240	And the other cop fucking died laughing.
3817360	3821920	And that segment brought to you by white male privilege.
3824480	3826560	If I were black, I would be dead.
3829120	3830880	From the makers of voter suppression.
3830880	3831840	Fuck that guy.
3831840	3832720	What a piece of shit.
3833440	3834480	Never got ticketed.
3834480	3835680	He fucking lied.
3835680	3836560	He was a dick.
3837280	3841440	And if I were, if I were a brown or a woman, I would, I would be behind bars.
3842640	3843760	Absolutely.
3843760	3844320	Thank God.
3847840	3849760	Yeah, but you'd probably be allowed to say Merry Christmas.
3851760	3852400	Man, okay.
3852400	3854400	I'm just saying, listen to some of these YouTube links.
3854400	3856160	I've been fucking like, I'm not getting political.
3856160	3857840	I'm just listening.
3857840	3861200	I never believed in the war on Christmas until today.
3861200	3863520	Yeah, Steve knows because I talked to him about it.
3863520	3865600	But this is very serious, you guys.
3866240	3874160	I saw the Reese's, the Reese's Christmas trees, you know, the new ones, and they don't have a stump.
3874160	3880400	They have a point the same as the top point of the tree and the same as the side points of the tree.
3880400	3883200	They have a bottom point and not a stump.
3883200	3888560	And you can go through in the Google and see the past Google, the Reese Christmas trees,
3888560	3892880	and they have stumps because they're Christmas trees because it's Christmas,
3892880	3893760	God damn it.
3893760	3895600	And it's a war on Christmas.
3895600	3900480	That's the only reason they would put a point on the bottom to make it like,
3901520	3902960	I'd starve David.
3902960	3903440	I don't know.
3905440	3910160	Shouldn't, if you, if you were breaking the Christmas movie, like if you were,
3910160	3913680	if you were like breaking the story for the Christmas sequel, for instance, like,
3913680	3918400	like wouldn't you be bending over backwards to try to figure out how to have there be a war on
3918400	3918880	Christmas?
3918880	3923840	Like, isn't Christmas, like, if it has anything to do with Christ, you know,
3923840	3926240	the guy who planted all the Christmas trees.
3926240	3927440	Yeah.
3929440	3940240	In, in 4000 B.C., the, the, the, the, like, if it was truly about Christ and there was a war on it,
3940240	3941920	doesn't that work better?
3941920	3943120	Isn't that more appropriate?
3943120	3947600	The man is famous for being fucking murdered.
3947600	3948240	Yeah.
3948240	3952240	Like you wear a thing around your neck of the guy dying.
3952240	3954880	He's like getting his ass kicked by the government.
3954880	3956560	That's what makes you Christian.
3956560	3958480	Be fucking proud of yourself.
3958480	3959680	Like war on Christmas.
3959680	3961120	You sound like a pussy.
3963840	3966960	Meaning you sound like you can do anything a penis can do.
3966960	3967440	Yeah.
3968320	3968960	Nice save.
3968960	3969920	Yes, I'm confusing.
3969920	3971040	Nice save.
3971040	3971840	But I'm safe.
3973040	3974960	You got to see these Reese's trees.
3974960	3976480	I got all my bases covered.
3978880	3980080	But it's, it's crazy.
3980080	3981840	Like, I know, like, whatever.
3981840	3983200	We, you know, we know everyone's dumb.
3983920	3989120	That's just, it's just like, has anyone ever, like, like,
3989120	3992240	have you ever, for real honest sincerity, like gauge yourself, like,
3993520	3998240	how much in your brain have you ever like kind of like altered your,
3998240	4000960	like, if you were about to say Merry Christmas, have you bothered to,
4000960	4002080	like, stop yourself?
4002080	4004560	How conscious are you of that interplay?
4004560	4006160	Like, if you bother to say Happy Holidays?
4006400	4008960	Who my non-Christian friends are, Jews, Arabs, whatever,
4008960	4012080	like non, like, Delineal, whatever, does that word.
4012720	4013520	Satanists.
4013520	4013680	Yeah.
4013680	4020560	Like, I, I, nobody is ever mad about the words Merry Christmas.
4020560	4022320	Because Merry Christmas means nothing.
4022320	4023200	It means nothing.
4023840	4024320	It doesn't mean anything.
4024320	4025200	Merry Christmas.
4025200	4026400	Why would I be married?
4026400	4029280	The guys that this poor kid's going to die before he's 40.
4029280	4030000	Yeah.
4030000	4031760	He just got born in a barn.
4031760	4039600	He's got, there's an ax there and he gets, he gets fucking shit that no kid would ever want.
4039600	4042080	And there's, there's three dudes from the fucking
4042080	4044240	orient that come over there and bringing him the worst.
4044240	4045760	The worst gifts ever.
4045760	4048640	And the supposed best, the best person.
4048640	4050160	What baby doesn't want mer?
4051520	4053920	Thank God the little drummer boys here.
4053920	4059040	Every baby shower I go to, I make sure to bring an unguence.
4059920	4064720	Do you know why, do you know why the baby Jesus smiles at the end of the little drummer boy song?
4064720	4067120	He's like, just fucking get away.
4067120	4068400	Leave me alone.
4070160	4072080	My brain is gelatin.
4072080	4075120	I can't, I can't lift cake to my mouth yet.
4075120	4077920	Also, I'm just, they call it the pressure.
4079440	4080480	They call it an in.
4080480	4081600	It's not a fucking in.
4082240	4083280	There's no room at the end.
4083280	4085120	This is, this is not even an in.
4085120	4086400	It's a fucking shack.
4086400	4087520	It's a barn outside.
4087520	4088080	This is a hot.
4088080	4091280	Well, wait, no, there's no room at the, there's no room at the end.
4091280	4092640	No, there's not even an in.
4092640	4093520	That's why they're in the barn.
4093520	4094400	Show me a fucking photo.
4094400	4097120	There's a second in on the grassy knoll.
4097120	4098800	You're saying, you're saying the in probably sucked.
4098800	4100640	There was never, there was no in.
4100640	4101600	There was never an in.
4104240	4105760	Well, I didn't know we were here.
4105760	4107760	Here's no in.
4107760	4109120	No, they added that.
4109120	4111760	Wouldn't that be the most famous in the world?
4111760	4112880	That was all.
4112880	4113680	Here's another thing.
4113680	4122160	Did you know that a fucking lumber does not burn at the temperature of a, all right, never mind.
4123120	4124640	I was like, the in is building seven.
4124640	4125040	I don't know.
4125840	4126720	Yeah, yeah.
4127440	4128480	It was an inside job.
4128480	4129440	There, there was no in.
4129440	4129920	It was.
4130480	4131840	There was no in.
4131840	4134320	Also, mangers.
4135680	4137200	Have you seen, have you gone on a manger gate?
4138160	4139200	Ha ha ha ha.
4141840	4145920	Who's the guy that's the most excited about about the true story of Christ?
4145920	4147440	Mel Gibson, the movie he made.
4147440	4148560	What's that movie like?
4148560	4150960	It's 90% fucking getting your ass kicked.
4152160	4153600	It's like underdog shit.
4153600	4154560	It's like you should why.
4154560	4156160	So why are you so mad?
4156160	4156480	Why?
4156480	4157440	Oh, boy.
4157440	4158320	Oh, boy.
4158320	4164320	Oh, Macy's is not allowed to like fucking roll out a red carpet for the naked man that I worship
4164400	4167360	for demonstrating to me that you should never be fucking afraid.
4167360	4169120	You should like hang out and love people.
4169120	4172240	And if they kill you, they fucking kill you because that's the currency.
4172240	4174080	I just don't get these people.
4174720	4176720	Merry Christmas to me.
4176720	4178560	Dan Harmon sarcastically.
4180080	4180960	She's going to take a shit.
4180960	4181920	She's not mad.
4181920	4182480	It's cool.
4185760	4188400	It's impossible that this is offensive to anyone.
4189680	4193200	This is there's no way anyone this is controversial at all.
4193600	4196080	When I went to India, maybe I've already spoken about this.
4196080	4199840	When Church and I were in India, there was Christmas decorations everywhere.
4200400	4202240	And this is during Christmas.
4202240	4205440	And they fucking worship every festival.
4205440	4206880	And it was like so magical.
4206880	4210560	Like there was Santa Clauses and Christmas trees and tinsel.
4210560	4211520	Oh, in India, right.
4211520	4213360	Because you said they have so many festivals.
4213360	4214240	Like they're like, whoa.
4214240	4219200	And they said, to us, it's the festival of giving and lights.
4219840	4222320	And we're like, oh, back in our hometown,
4222320	4223440	Church said hilariously.
4223440	4227200	She goes, back in America, there's a war on Christmas.
4227200	4228480	Apparently, India won.
4230880	4236080	They celebrate the festival of gifts and the festival of lights
4236080	4240240	and the festival of everybody being like on the same team.
4240240	4243600	People all dress up as Santa Clauses and all give each other gifts.
4243600	4244880	Everybody's Santa.
4244880	4245840	Everybody is a child.
4245840	4248240	Because you characterized India, it almost sounded like,
4248240	4254720	as far as their civic observation of other religions and things,
4254720	4257920	they're kind of like following the, well, it's happy hour somewhere,
4257920	4259120	kind of like formula.
4259120	4260880	Which is not, I don't mean to mischaracterize.
4260880	4263280	I don't want to get your letters like I have a mailbox of like,
4263280	4265520	you know, India is a really unfair place to blah, blah, blah.
4265520	4267600	I'm just saying, like in terms of their municipality,
4267600	4271120	like you said that they're kind of like, I don't know how you phrase it.
4271760	4274080	They worship, they speak a million languages.
4275520	4279840	They obey or observe 100 religions.
4279840	4282800	They're very heterodoxic and heterodoxic.
4282800	4283600	I'm stealing it.
4283600	4284080	What does it mean?
4285600	4286480	Like heterodoxy.
4287520	4288160	Give it to me.
4288160	4289600	Let me fucking sound smart.
4289600	4290480	I want to know what it means.
4291280	4293280	If it means pickles, I don't want to accidentally use it.
4294160	4297120	It means like the other, like heterosexual, like the other.
4297120	4301120	Like, like, oh, like, oh, what's the last word?
4301120	4301600	Doxic?
4301600	4302080	What is it?
4302800	4304320	Heterodoxy.
4304320	4305120	Doxy.
4305120	4305840	Oh, doxy.
4305840	4306480	Like, okay.
4307360	4310880	Stacy Schiff, who wrote a great biography of Cleopatra,
4310880	4315680	said that Alexandria bustled with heterodoxy.
4315680	4318720	Like compatibility, like, like, yeah, like the opposite of xenophobia.
4318720	4321280	The like saying, like, hey, if you're going to be big, like,
4321280	4322080	you can be Jewish.
4322080	4322800	You can be Islamic.
4322800	4323680	You can do whatever the fuck.
4323680	4325360	And nobody fucking cares.
4325440	4328080	Like Taoism and like Eastern religions are heterodoxy.
4328720	4329520	Go ahead, be Christian.
4329520	4330160	Never heard of them.
4330160	4330960	Like, fucking bring them in.
4332720	4333280	What did he say?
4334240	4336240	Did he say you can't be Taoist?
4336240	4337360	Can't find it in the rule book.
4337360	4337520	All right.
4337520	4338320	Then he's allowed in.
4339440	4343920	However, and forgive our listeners if I'm repeating myself.
4343920	4347920	Our driver, I asked her, like, so you celebrate every festival?
4347920	4348640	And she goes, yeah, I go.
4350080	4350720	Jewish festivals?
4350720	4351680	She goes, nah.
4351680	4352160	No.
4353040	4353540	Meh.
4355040	4357840	But it wasn't because of I don't think it's because of anti-Semitism.
4357840	4361680	I think she's like, like, it's their stuff is really for them.
4361680	4364400	Like, it's like you don't get to like, kind of just that sounds like.
4364400	4371120	It's just that's exactly what German stuff is really for them.
4371120	4371760	Let's get them.
4373600	4375200	I don't like this boys club stuff.
4375760	4377440	What if we were proud of our blood line?
4379840	4381120	You got me.
4381120	4383360	Oh, I can't believe how proud I was getting.
4384960	4386480	Yeah, I don't know.
4387520	4388960	It's all it's a mixed bag.
4388960	4393200	And I think that the more heterodoxical if I'm making a word up, I don't care.
4393840	4398640	Invariance with the accepted or official traditional religion.
4400240	4401760	I'm wondering about the subject.
4401760	4402240	It works.
4402240	4404240	Doxical because like paradoxical.
4404240	4405520	What's dox-doxical?
4405520	4406080	What does that mean?
4406080	4409200	It means like a belief system, like orthodoxy.
4410160	4411040	Orthodoxy.
4411040	4413040	Like culture and docs.
4413040	4414240	What else ends in docs?
4414240	4419360	I think it's fun to listen to the listen to the history of English podcast.
4419360	4420000	It's so great.
4420000	4420880	I got to learn more.
4421440	4422880	It's like it makes you feel so dumb.
4422880	4424960	But then you like you can just listen to it over and over again.
4424960	4427680	It's like, okay, I got 1% of that in my brain.
4428560	4429040	Crazy.
4430240	4434800	Okay, so I've googled that heterodoxy in a religious sense means any opinions or
4434800	4437920	doctrines at variance with an official or orthodox position.
4438800	4439280	Right.
4439280	4442640	Under this definition, heterodoxy is similar to unorthodoxy.
4442640	4446560	While the adjective heterodox could be applied to a dissident.
4447200	4447680	Right.
4447680	4452000	So well, yeah, I mean, when I read that word, I mean, maybe I'm getting it all wrong.
4452000	4456560	But when I read that word, I took it to mean the idea that other things are happening at once.
4456560	4457040	Right.
4457040	4457600	Right.
4457600	4460960	Basically, it's the precursor to sometimes fascist slides.
4461600	4468720	Like from what I understand, it's like whether it's economic, whether there's economic instability
4468720	4473520	or not, it's basically like when there's like technologically assisted kind of cultural upheaval
4473520	4477680	where it starts to feel like there's gridlock happening and there's horns honking.
4478800	4483040	The older folk, they do what we've seen them do, which is to start to go like,
4483040	4486640	well, it wasn't like this when I was a kid, honk, honk, honk.
4486640	4490800	And then anybody who starts walking down that crowded sidewalk
4490800	4493360	with a sandwich board that goes like, who loves Hitler?
4493360	4497920	Like they start even though they were yesterday because they were able to get to work on time
4498800	4504960	and weren't being embarrassed more than five times a year about their like,
4504960	4507760	you know, foot and mouth moments of like, oh, I guess I didn't know everything.
4507760	4512400	When that hits six times a year or more, it's multiculturalism.
4512400	4517680	It's like the potting soil for, you know, fascist to like impulse.
4517920	4522560	That you can live in a culture and believe something other than the orthodox
4522560	4526160	ideal of that culture and that'd be all right.
4526160	4529280	I mean, because when's that ever paid off for any country?
4532640	4535600	When did we ever get the impression that like, oh,
4537120	4542320	slippery slope letting these foreigners like, in like, are you fucking kidding me?
4542720	4544880	Fucking all pieces of shit.
4546160	4551120	You fucking like grandsons of fucking yokels from some fucking European country.
4551120	4557520	I gotta say, like, going around touring the country, doing comedy shows and driving through
4557520	4563600	America and the moment you get a bit outside of kind of the major cultural hubs,
4563600	4569120	like colleges and, you know, major cities, Confederate flags waving.
4569120	4570240	And like, what?
4570240	4579520	Like you weren't even a boo to you weren't a slave state, Ohio or fucking Minnesota.
4580960	4583680	You weren't even in the fucking fight in the fucking thing.
4584480	4588640	And you're that flag is just simply a signal saying, keep moving.
4588640	4589040	Right.
4589040	4591360	If you're not a white asshole.
4591360	4595760	And I can't like it's I love traveling the country.
4595760	4598720	I love performing around the country and I don't mean to talk about any
4598720	4608480	particular cities in general, but it's like you waving your flag of obvious bigotry is crazy.
4608480	4608800	Yeah.
4608800	4611920	And if you're in Ohio, then you're saying you got your frustration is you're going,
4611920	4613440	God damn it, that's next door to me.
4613440	4615600	And I can't there's no flag I can put out.
4615600	4617120	I can't put out a United Nations flag.
4618480	4619200	I can't do it.
4619200	4620240	There's no flag.
4620240	4622160	Although in my place, I have a huge Brexit flag.
4623120	4623440	Right.
4623440	4626560	There's no flag that says like, I'm fucking down to clown.
4626560	4632160	Like, like, like a real American always has been what with the flag.
4632160	4633440	How would you how would you design?
4634320	4638160	It's got a clown shrugging would have a flag on it.
4638160	4639840	Like, how would you how would you do down the clown?
4639840	4640880	I don't know, man.
4640880	4643120	I'm not I'm not in the mood to joke about it.
4643120	4643680	It gets me.
4643680	4645840	It gets me uncharismatic to talk about it.
4645840	4648320	I just so like I've said it a thousand times.
4648800	4654960	First of all, I am the grandchild of fucking women that are covered in crazy
4654960	4657520	Eastern European warts and speak with accents.
4657520	4660320	Like, I can't this country is so young.
4660320	4662880	Like, I am the whitest guy in this room.
4662880	4669440	And I am a stone's throw from immigration, like, and not people who came over here
4669440	4675040	and cleared the fucking list of like, well, are you here to make us rich?
4675040	4676800	No, I'm here to fucking hide.
4676800	4678320	I'm here to fucking run.
4678320	4681040	I'm here because I am I will die.
4681040	4686800	I jumped out the window of the skyscraper of my burning country and I'm landing here.
4686800	4689920	I don't I need somewhere to stay.
4689920	4691920	We made that big business.
4691920	4698160	I don't like how can people be so fucking rude and mean and hypocritical?
4698960	4703760	And when the answer is well, because they don't understand and you're hurting their feelings
4703760	4707920	because it's it sucks to to be made fun of for being stupid.
4707920	4711840	I don't want to fucking boo who like, like, what do you mean?
4711840	4713760	You look like like like read a book.
4713760	4719360	I don't like I just so I just get so fucking mad about it because I'm like, I like what?
4719360	4722640	When did we how did we how did we get so fucking dumb?
4722640	4724800	Like, why are we like whatever?
4724800	4732000	That's that's the the evolution of vampires is that we always just you you crest and you fall.
4732080	4736080	But we and we're doing a very particular predictable fall.
4736080	4738320	But we didn't we didn't get anywhere near the crest.
4738320	4747680	We we fucking we all we did was like accidentally stumble into the internet age.
4747680	4754640	Like we because of the culture that we created over here for better or for worse of like,
4754640	4761440	like we were like, hey, man, capitalism poker chips like like keep you have your religion,
4761440	4765040	have your cookbooks, have your fucking politics.
4765040	4769200	Like, like, like, we're never gonna knock on your door and check up on you.
4769200	4770240	Do what you do.
4770240	4773120	Pay your taxes like it's a big experiment over here.
4773120	4778960	And if there was like, like, it's not a controversial statement to say we invented the internet.
4778960	4782320	Is it is there is someone from from Scotland?
4782320	4783600	You got your friend from Scotland here.
4783600	4786480	I don't like either because I know if you say like we invented the
4786480	4788240	Oh, by the way, can we give a shout out?
4788240	4792640	This motherfucker, Colin came all the way from Glasgow, Scotland to come see us last week.
4795120	4797520	Colin, did you invent the internet?
4798640	4800240	No, steam engine.
4800240	4801760	They invented it together.
4801760	4802480	And the headbutt.
4803680	4804320	Fucking own it.
4804320	4805360	You invented the headbutt.
4805360	4806000	He helped.
4808720	4811200	Is it a Scottish is it is it a Scottish?
4812480	4814960	I listened to that podcast, The Illusionist.
4814960	4817600	And it's like about like, yeah, language.
4817600	4822720	And it was talking about like, how the Scots are like, so bullied, like linguistically,
4822720	4824000	like, they're calling jump on stage.
4824000	4824880	So we could see them.
4824880	4826720	Do you want to come up if you want to come up?
4826720	4827440	Come up and share.
4827440	4828880	We don't get to hear Scottish people.
4829520	4830560	He traveled a mighty long way.
4830560	4831440	I can just sit down then.
4832720	4833360	Thank God.
4834160	4835200	Oh, we have a guest.
4835200	4835840	I can sit down.
4835840	4837120	You've been standing for a while.
4839680	4840640	Yeah, yeah.
4840640	4841200	Yeah, here.
4841200	4841600	Give me that.
4841600	4842320	That was on my phone.
4842320	4843280	Dan needs that.
4843280	4843600	Thank you.
4843600	4844240	For later.
4846240	4846960	You want to drink?
4846960	4848160	Is there a body there?
4848160	4848960	We can reload you.
4848960	4849600	There will be.
4850960	4853040	This is going to be production value, just your accent.
4853040	4854880	We don't get to hear Scottish people enough.
4854880	4857200	Well, I've seen Jeff.
4857200	4860480	I've been doing my best to hate my Glaswegian.
4860480	4861920	You're from Glasgow, right?
4861920	4862400	Yeah.
4862400	4862880	I know.
4864560	4866160	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4866160	4868720	But you said originally you're from this place called the Clay Bank.
4868720	4869680	Oh, I'm from Clay Bank.
4869680	4869920	Yeah.
4871120	4871440	Woo.
4872720	4873600	And they're famous.
4873600	4874240	Nobody here?
4874240	4875040	Nobody from Clay Bank?
4875200	4877200	I don't know if that works.
4877200	4880560	The Clay Bank's claim to fame, there's like memorials there and stuff
4880560	4883600	because they were targeted intensely by Nazi bombings.
4883600	4890400	We were very good at making, well, we had singer sewing machines.
4890960	4892640	Someone here may know that.
4893440	4899040	Or in that we had John Brown shipyards and we made ships that helped fight the Nazis.
4899040	4902240	So you were a war target because of the shipbuilding
4902240	4904800	and the sewing machines for fabric and public?
4904800	4906960	Maybe not the sewing machines, but definitely.
4908160	4911440	But wouldn't you think that there would be like uniforms and sales?
4911440	4913840	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4913840	4916160	They came after us because of the shipbuilding.
4916160	4918160	Like, they fucked us up.
4919680	4920160	I'm not like-
4920160	4921840	Have you talked to somebody from Edinburgh?
4921840	4924480	In my experience, Colin, you talked to someone from Edinburgh
4924480	4928080	and they call it a headbutt, they call it a Glasgow kiss.
4928080	4930800	Do you call it a Glasgow kiss or do you call it something else?
4930800	4932000	I call it fucking sore.
4932800	4933520	You call it what?
4934160	4934960	Fucking sore?
4936400	4937360	Now I'm scared.
4937360	4938480	You can, now I'm terrified.
4940400	4947840	Yeah, so I listened to this podcast about the British kind of treatment of the...
4948560	4953600	It's like being Scottish in a British empire
4953600	4958080	and how that has functioned throughout history in particularly the language.
4959760	4962000	And Americans, or I'll just speak for myself,
4962000	4963360	really not that familiar with it at all.
4963440	4968960	I'm just familiar with it enough to know that there's basically a Scottish language
4968960	4972880	that I would not understand at all because it's like not...
4974160	4979600	And then it's like there's a Scottish dialect that makes English its own thing.
4980240	4985200	And then as school kids, even if you're going...
4985200	4987760	This is my question because I'm not sure I got this right.
4988320	4991040	Even if you're going to school in Scotland,
4991600	4994800	are you kind of shamed for the jargon?
4995600	5000480	I think the closest possible metaphor we would have in America is the Ebonic thing.
5001200	5004320	When we had this thing where we had a word for it and then people were like,
5004320	5005200	how dare you?
5006560	5011440	But that may be a really offensive analog for either side, but it's...
5011440	5014640	Colin, you said that you are Scots-Irish too, right?
5014640	5016880	Yeah, me and my granddess from Donegal.
5017600	5021200	How much of your upbringing, did you actually speak Scots or Scots-Irish?
5022160	5030960	I've never spoke proper Scottish Gaelic, so it's like Irish Scottish Gaelic.
5030960	5032400	I don't really know Scottish Gaelic.
5032400	5036720	I know when I've had a few drinks in me and I've been out for a scone game,
5036720	5039680	I can murmur my way through a Scottish Gaelic.
5039680	5045120	If you do a Robbie Burns poem, would you know it in English or would you know it in Scots?
5045120	5052160	I'd probably do Bear with Scottish, but one of the main things I can remember from my granddess,
5052160	5053120	I knew both.
5053120	5057520	He was from Donegal and nicest, best guy in the world ever.
5058320	5068560	He went to a shop with my brothers and the shopkeeper was foreign and he was speaking a different
5068560	5074480	language to someone else, so he was dealing with my granddess.
5074640	5082400	He found that really offensive, so he refused to speak English or Scottish to this person
5082400	5086160	until they acknowledged him as Scottish, so all he did was just speak Scottish Gaelic.
5086160	5086640	Really?
5086640	5090160	And it lasted from what my brother said quite a while,
5090720	5096000	of just him intentionally speaking to my brother in Scottish Gaelic until this person would then go,
5096000	5096480	oh sorry.
5099600	5102400	Irish racism is one of the great racisms of all time.
5102480	5108080	Oh yeah, I'm sure as a Glaswegian comedian, I think it was Frankie Boyle said that like
5108080	5111840	the Irish invented sectarianism and Scotland perfected it.
5115120	5116080	Who is it that was correct me?
5116080	5118160	Oh, it was my ex-wife because my ex-wife is Irish now.
5118160	5130320	She lives in Ireland and I referred to the whole fucking banana bowl as the UK and she's like,
5130400	5134080	first of all, Ireland is not in the UK and I was like, okay, yeah, all right, all right.
5135440	5140080	And then she was like, well, half of it is and that's the source of like a bunch of,
5140080	5142000	and I'm like, all right, so it's not that big a misunderstanding.
5142000	5143680	One core, maybe.
5143680	5148000	But like Scotland is very, like Scotland is, we were in Scotland and like we spent a lot of time
5148000	5151760	because they were having an election that was coming up about the possible secession
5152640	5154640	and that didn't go through.
5154640	5159440	It didn't, but I think Brexit may help.
5159440	5160800	Were you pro-independence or?
5160800	5162000	Yeah, I was pro-independence.
5162000	5164240	Yeah, it's incredible.
5165440	5172080	And if you guys had made it, you would have had, and one day I think Scotland will be independent.
5172080	5172720	Yeah.
5172720	5177120	And you will have the best national anthem of all time because Flower of Scotland is fucking.
5177120	5178800	Flower of Scotland is fucking amazing.
5178800	5179520	Sing a bit for us.
5180240	5180960	I'll be happy to.
5180960	5189920	When she bloom, she bloom like flowers of Scotland.
5191440	5196480	From the pipes, the pipes they blow for me.
5198240	5203520	Gardens and the dragon's navy name.
5203520	5207440	They mice and the mice, navy dragon men.
5208320	5217120	But I long for flowers of Scotland and I hit my wife again.
5218640	5219760	Oh, he drooled.
5221360	5224800	I just started thinking of Sean Connery right at the end there.
5227200	5231280	Somebody told me Sean Connery in like a 60 Minutes interview, like the interviewer was like,
5231280	5235120	you said at one point it's okay to slap a woman if she disagrees with it.
5235120	5236240	He was like, I stand by it.
5238000	5238320	Wow.
5239440	5244480	Yeah, it was an awesome, like, sometimes you need to know what's what.
5246480	5248000	I was like, what did he say?
5248640	5249680	They're like, what do you think?
5249680	5254800	And this is obviously something that must be before 1989 that this interview happened.
5254800	5261840	But he was like, his explanation was, if you have a fight and you've already won,
5261840	5264720	that the man's won and then she keeps going.
5265840	5270240	Wow, must be nice to live in a world where fights are won ever.
5270800	5271680	Holy crap.
5272720	5275920	And then in the context of the 60 Minutes piece or whatever, they're like,
5275920	5279440	but here's the thing, happily married for 27 years.
5279440	5280880	They're like, hey, think about it.
5280880	5282080	Maybe you should try it at home.
5284320	5286720	And all the women in the writers room I remember talking about, they're like,
5286960	5289200	uh, happily?
5289200	5291760	Like, where's the 60 Minutes piece on his wife?
5293280	5293680	Anyways.
5293680	5293920	All right.
5293920	5296240	So that's why I threw that into the national anthem.
5296240	5304720	Oh, if you ever see a rugby match or whatever, and the crowd sings a cappella.
5307600	5308000	Sorry.
5308000	5309600	That's just me being an asshole.
5309600	5313200	But if you ever hear the crowd a cappella sing a flower of Scotland, it's beautiful.
5313200	5313600	Oh yeah.
5313600	5313840	Yeah.
5313840	5318400	I go to every, uh, um, part of, well, for my sins and part of the tartan army.
5318400	5322160	So yeah, that's every fucking game you sing for a Scotland.
5322160	5327120	And then you get your heart broken because some Belgium guy just scored a fucking screamer
5327120	5328480	from absolutely about it.
5330000	5332720	And then you, and then you go for a couple of pints and you go, oh yeah.
5332720	5338960	Well, I mean, one of my favorite, uh, when Trump got elected, one of my favorite protest
5338960	5345120	photos, when it, when he did, when he did the Arab, uh, ban or tried to do that, uh,
5345120	5352240	there was a Scottish woman holding up a poster that said, she said, your mother was an immigrant.
5352240	5354880	You absolute roaster, roaster.
5355520	5360320	I don't even know what a roaster means, but it's fucking, it sounds like a roaster.
5361360	5364560	And what about your fucking continuing supply of mail order?
5364560	5366240	Brian, are you fucking kidding me?
5367040	5367440	Oh yeah.
5367440	5371760	I hate, like, like, like, like, it's, I don't remember this.
5371760	5372640	I must have missed this.
5372640	5373040	No, no.
5373040	5376880	I'm just, I just like, again, it's like, I'm not charismatic when I give a shit about this.
5376880	5383920	Oh, no, it's, it's a, we see your likes again.
5385280	5389440	That's fought and died for, for who?
5389440	5389760	Yeah.
5389760	5394960	We bet hell and glen and stewed against it.
5394960	5402560	I've been stroking, stroking, stroking on the glen.
5404880	5407440	If it makes you feel better, I was about to show you wanker.
5408480	5410240	I've been we stroking.
5410240	5412720	I'm not we stroking.
5412720	5418080	No, normally after you say fucking proud Edward's army, if you're an independent client,
5418080	5418960	you show wanker.
5421360	5424400	You want to hear the phrase that they taught me in Milwaukee Comedy
5424400	5426160	Sports when we had our accent workshop.
5426160	5427360	So I would love to.
5427360	5428000	I'm pretty sure.
5429200	5432160	I'll start with a couple others that aren't for Irish.
5432160	5435360	They taught because they got, and they go like, we've got to give you a crash course.
5435360	5436160	45 minutes.
5436160	5437840	We're going to teach you 20 accents.
5437840	5442240	So we're going to teach you one line from each accent that if you say it,
5442240	5444240	maybe you can maybe do the accent.
5444240	5445440	It hooks you into, right?
5445600	5447200	Like it's like it's like if you want to do George Bush.
5448080	5448800	Okay, now I'm ready.
5449600	5450000	Go for it.
5450000	5450640	Go for it.
5450640	5452080	But he just died.
5452080	5452480	He just died.
5452480	5453200	He just died.
5453200	5454400	He's an amazing president.
5456800	5459040	But for Irish, they go like, keep it in the back of your teeth.
5460240	5462000	You think you love me, but you don't.
5464960	5465840	Everything's like breathy.
5465840	5468160	And I say, you think you love me, but you don't.
5469120	5474080	And then Scottish was, it's a great, great day for motor car racing.
5474080	5475760	Motor car racing.
5475760	5477040	That's what it was.
5477040	5479760	And we would always, the only thing we did, it was like sort of like,
5480320	5482560	I was like, okay, now we're accent experts.
5484560	5485360	Can we get an accent?
5485360	5487840	Scottish and everybody in the scene would just come in.
5487840	5490240	It's a great, great day for motor car racing.
5490240	5491920	Yes, it is a great day for...
5491920	5492800	Is that Jackie Stewart?
5492800	5494880	I thought Jackie Stewart.
5494880	5497440	I thought you were going to do the Sean Connery and Moosh thing.
5497440	5500880	Moosh things down here don't react well to motor car racing.
5500880	5506800	And if they don't react well, I'm fine with it.
5506800	5509200	But if they're women, you give them a slap.
5512320	5515360	It's a bra, bra, mule, nip.
5515360	5521200	B-A-L-A-N-C-E, balance.
5522320	5523440	That's him in Highlander.
5524400	5528320	I think calling a song really, you didn't even quite know,
5528320	5530160	called I Belong the Glasgow, which is great.
5530160	5535280	I think it was the... Is it Jerry Rafferty?
5535280	5535840	I have no idea.
5535840	5538400	I think it might have been Jerry Rafferty, but absolutely.
5538400	5540560	Someone's going to be hearing this from Scotland and we're going...
5540560	5542080	I've been with a few of my coronese.
5542080	5543680	One or two powers of mine.
5544320	5545200	We went into a hotel.
5545200	5545840	Sorry, I said...
5545840	5548480	We did very well and then we were in a hotel.
5548480	5549920	To us, cunt is confetti.
5553680	5555920	Did you call me a cunt-fetti?
5558160	5559760	Well, you just fucking call me a cunt.
5560480	5562240	We're out of action.
5562240	5563520	We can't care.
5563520	5565280	I just never know because I've been warned
5565280	5566480	about Glaswegians because...
5567040	5569920	Glaswegians? Is that what they call people from Glasgow?
5569920	5573280	That's adorable, but probably saying that will get me murdered.
5574000	5575120	I can make it absolutely...
5575120	5576000	Well, I don't know.
5576000	5578240	I could say you can make it cure worse.
5578240	5580240	People from Clay Bank call bankies.
5580240	5581040	Bankies?
5581040	5581360	Bankies?
5581360	5582720	Oh, we bankies.
5582720	5586000	Which also kind of seems like it's our fault for the fucking crisis.
5586320	5587360	But, oh, it's in the whole show.
5587360	5587840	Oh, but yeah.
5589600	5590160	Glasgow...
5590160	5593200	Now, are you supposed to say Glasgow or Glasgow?
5593200	5593840	Glasgow.
5593840	5594480	Glasgow.
5594960	5596640	Sorry, that sounded a bit gnarly.
5596640	5601360	Is there such a thing as an upper-class glass collegian?
5601360	5602800	Yeah, no, you're not saying, yeah.
5602800	5604800	Because it's mostly there in the West End,
5604800	5606560	which is where I currently work.
5607760	5608880	How big is it compared...
5608880	5610160	Can you think of an American city?
5610160	5611760	Do you know populations of American cities?
5611760	5613760	Can you say it's big as Houston?
5613760	5614480	Of course you can.
5614480	5615440	That's what they do in Scotland.
5615520	5619200	They sit around in the San Francisco study populations of American cities.
5619200	5620160	It's definitely tiny.
5620160	5621840	Is that San Francisco, maybe?
5621840	5622400	Certainly.
5624000	5625680	Well, we're probably...
5625680	5626880	I'd say we're quite small.
5626880	5633120	But the way you were saying with the loss of the dialect,
5633120	5637040	I think quite a lot of it comes from what you're also saying is about the posture.
5638560	5641520	I work in the West-ish.
5641520	5647200	And if I spoke how, well, I speak like this and how to use,
5647200	5648160	and that's how I speak to them.
5648160	5649600	But if I spoke normally,
5649600	5652560	they would absolutely have no fucking idea what the fuck I was saying.
5653440	5654080	Nobody tell them.
5654080	5654640	Nobody tell them.
5655600	5656720	No, I would not have a job.
5661840	5663760	You think you sound like Tom Brokaw right now.
5666160	5671280	But you're saying you're making an effort to be like,
5671600	5673840	okay, I'm talking to Americans, like, here I am.
5673840	5674560	No, but it's the same.
5674560	5675440	It's the same there.
5675440	5677200	This is the same effort I'd make for them where...
5678000	5680960	If your family called you up or you got in a fight with somebody or...
5682160	5683280	This is not my right speech.
5684240	5686160	Give us the thickest Brokaw that you got.
5686160	5687280	Like, I go, how?
5687280	5687840	Yeah.
5687840	5688960	Like, to yell at...
5688960	5692560	Do you have an impression of your least favorite relative?
5692560	5696400	I'll be an American, like ringing your doorbell and asking for directions.
5698720	5700960	Do your doors go bing-bong or are they like,
5701520	5705520	Hey!
5705520	5707680	Oh, from Scotland!
5710480	5712640	It's more of a later Storm of Medica.
5714400	5715360	I don't know.
5715360	5716160	It's just going to sound fake.
5716160	5718320	Their doorbells are bagpipes!
5718320	5719200	Yeah, yeah.
5719200	5720000	We don't have doorbells.
5720000	5721120	It was a good shot.
5721760	5722560	They're doorpipes.
5723520	5724640	He's doing it.
5724640	5725200	Oh, shit.
5726320	5726880	Oh, oh, sorry.
5726880	5727760	No, I'm sorry.
5727760	5728640	We're fucking it up.
5729200	5729680	You do it.
5729680	5730560	I can do it.
5730560	5731560	No, you were getting raised.
5731560	5732560	Okay, all right.
5732560	5734400	Ask him a question.
5734400	5735400	Play ball here.
5735400	5736400	Excuse me.
5736400	5743120	I'm from Iowa and I love your Loch Ness Monster country and I'd like to, I just want to know,
5743120	5744480	where's the Wi-Fi?
5744480	5745520	Can you help me?
5745520	5749840	You fucking, I consider you lower.
5749840	5751240	I'm totally rude.
5751240	5754040	So just fucking let go on me.
5754040	5755720	He wants fries with that.
5755720	5756720	Yeah.
5756720	5757720	Is this a restaurant?
5757720	5758720	What's going on?
5758720	5759720	Here.
5759720	5764800	Why don't you go back to fucking England, you fucking dirty, dirty bastard.
5764800	5765800	That sounds normal.
5765800	5766800	I was very fortunate.
5766800	5767800	You and McGregor.
5767800	5768800	All right.
5768800	5769800	Don.
5769800	5780600	Can we talk about the brown sauce they put on the fucking bacon buddy or the chip buddy?
5780600	5784440	It's the fucking, it's the greasiest thing I've ever had in my life.
5785440	5786440	Well, it depends.
5786440	5790920	In Edinburgh, I'm pretty sure, I've suddenly stopped talking a wee bit, but.
5790920	5791920	No, no, it's good.
5791920	5799120	In Edinburgh, I think the brown sauce is normal, it's just red sauce, which is also a point.
5799120	5807320	So if you're in Glasgow and you speak kind of normal, it's a red sauce, red sauce, and
5807320	5813240	if you go somewhere fancy, it's, oh, can I have some ketchup?
5814240	5817640	I had a fucking, have you ever had a bacon buddy?
5817640	5819160	I've had a roll in bacon.
5819160	5822480	It's just fucking french fries on a roll.
5822480	5823480	That's it.
5823480	5824480	A bacon buddy is English.
5824480	5825480	There's no bacon?
5825480	5826480	Bacon buddy has the bacon.
5826480	5827480	A chip buddy is just chips.
5827480	5828480	Yeah, but I think so.
5828480	5831120	It's a roll in bacon.
5831120	5835920	Dan and I were in, it was freezing tits, we were there like during like New Year's Eve,
5836160	5838160	I used it.
5838160	5844880	And we had a fucking, a deep fried Mars bar, which was fucking good.
5844880	5845880	It's me.
5845880	5848440	That's the fucking oddest stereotype you've ever had.
5848440	5849440	Sorry, who is it?
5849440	5854440	Sorry, it's just, it's me, M.C. Scottish secession.
5854440	5859440	Hey, how come you didn't secede?
5859440	5862400	Zach, are you up there?
5862400	5864400	Why does Zach have to be up there?
5864400	5865400	Yeah.
5865880	5866880	Oh, because I'm an M.C.
5866880	5867880	It feels like I might need a beat.
5867880	5868880	Oh, no.

5971920	5976320	what's the time sorry you go ahead go like you're going back in a couple days
5976320	5981600	you said yeah I go back in Thursday yeah what's the city in Scotland is it
5981600	5986720	Edinburgh that's like like like so you said like Glasgow is not like you have a
5986720	5992320	you have a you have a fancy glass what did you say glass collegians glass
5992320	5999160	regions yeah we just like normal so I would say that we get cold well is there
5999160	6002760	a nickname for him like we had weed bees here like young upwardly weed you get
6002760	6005440	cold or oh but you all of you collectively but I'm saying like do you
6005440	6009920	have a name for the upper class class
6009920	6016320	yeah but if you're just tuning in that word means a different thing in your
6016320	6035040	up like it's not it doesn't have quite the great good I think I saw our friends
6035040	6039280	with a comedian in Scotland and he said something like I'm gonna absolutely
6039280	6043880	butcher this fucking bit but it's a Scotland is the most progressive place
6043880	6050240	the world because it's been a place where women are suddenly is the most
6050240	6053680	progressive place the world because women don't see gender because every
6053680	6060240	single week women are telling guys are going to kick their cunt and absolutely
6060240	6064640	butcher that the guy's fucking amazing by his DVD I guess I was gonna ask like
6064640	6071240	it was great is it is it is is Edinburgh is that the is that the capital of
6071240	6076040	Scotland and is that the the the New York of Scotland in in terms of like
6076040	6084720	finance glass go is glass go bigger than Edinburgh I think to do with finance
6084720	6089000	and stuff it is but I think also okay Scotland revolves so much around like
6089000	6093560	well that's in keeping like we have DC which is smaller and less important
6093560	6097320	because you are more industrial right like that's where the more they also
6097320	6103120	like we've we've got this sounds so fucking pathetic but we've got like the
6103120	6110800	two best football teams or soccer teams as well yeah which one Rangers or
6110800	6118920	selling Rangers are you so Lakers yeah I'm selling fuck I'm I'm I'm a I'm a

6144680	6149200	different sides of the town yeah and arrive at different times and different
6149200	6152640	times because and you're not allowed to even wear the strip you can't even yeah
6153480	6157920	you can't wear the jerseys around town there's just gonna be violence yeah oh
6157920	6166520	yeah sorry go ahead we said Celtics been doing so well currently and the last
6166520	6172720	time we won I broke switch of one hour that we won three to money had worked

6188440	6193040	it's came from Germany where if you win you will see you you go see your fans
6193040	6197400	you wave and you can like thank you do your victory parade yeah so they came
6197400	6202880	over to say like cheers and Rangers fans in the bottom left corner from what I
6202880	6209240	remember we're not happy but at the very very front of their fans is people
6209240	6214520	in wheelchairs with disabilities and the Rangers fans decided to climb on top of
6214520	6219360	them and try and get on the pitch to attack the safety fans which led to a
6219360	6224160	lot of people in wheelchairs getting trampled on and stood on and it was Ranger
6224160	6232440	fans traveling their own yeah that's where liking sports gets you do you guys
6232440	6239320	still have a spider on your money they have a spider on their dollar George
6239320	6246960	Washington is a guy who went in a cave and like fought a spider right it's
6246960	6251520	crazy that's when your country's old enough it's like there's no oh you made
6251520	6254800	a head wooden teeth he might not have it's like oh you wrote a dragon and he
6254800	6259560	had spiders in his eyes like it's like some guy who just was in a cave with a
6259560	6265440	spider it was definitely true but I've got tenor it's just the rabbi burns and
6265440	6269600	it's very plastic but there's like a spider where's the spider oh yes I mean

6284600	6290400	national animal is a fucking unicorn yeah that's not allowed they're not
6290400	6294760	allowed they've chosen their national animal to be a fucking I'm sorry that is
6294760	6298200	not that's not allowed
6298200	6305320	totally is also oh my passport was a fucking unicorn no Scotland's not even a
6305320	6311280	country they said like they they wonder oh that's sweet and talk oh you we can't
6311280	6315800	you fucking dog got a headbutt coming from your bagpipe now he's gonna head
6315800	6322800	by you I'm sorry I sounded Irish you fucking can't I'm gonna bury my gold
6322800	6328280	under a tree you're never gonna find it you'll never find my Scottish rainbow
6328280	6333880	you're doing lucky the leprechaun you Scottish charms surprise more scores
6333880	6350760	like Americans and stuff don't do bagbies voice for trains one my Irish ex-wife
6350760	6356440	was talking about Ireland with me and I asked you but because she was like here
6356440	6360040	I said when Trump got elected it was like boy we're having some grief and all
6360040	6362720	this stuff and I was like I had said at one point in this podcast I'm like you
6362720	6366680	know what we need to do is just have a president like we at this point we all
6366680	6373640	agree that the president is the new king and we should have a the let the
6373640	6379160	president be a ceremonial title because it has so much more to do with pride and
6379160	6383720	fucking symbolism and let the smarty pantses that are only gonna ruin that
6383720	6388360	party actually understand that there's the equivalent of like a chancellor or
6388360	6394440	prime minister who went to law school and graduated any school and and is like
6394440	6397840	you elect them based on like their job that they're gonna do and they don't
6397840	6401520	wear a jacket she told me Ireland has that exact thing they have an Irish
6401520	6407400	president and who is really more like I'm the Irish president and I'm just like
6407400	6410640	kind of here to say it's great to be Irish and they have an iron and then
6410640	6416700	they have a prime minister who's actually kind of like yeah because of the
6416700	6422220	way I don't think anybody really truly knows Irish politics that well because
6422220	6429400	it's a fucking mess because they don't fucking count I'm trying to like I'm
6429400	6434780	trying to get on your good side but I'm sounding I'm on it's me your friend Dan
6434780	6441740	Harmon but they I think they I think the way it works because the Northern
6441740	6446940	Ireland Republic Ireland if you're voting for Canada they're probably like you
6446940	6453020	have to vote for a Sinn Féin so I think there's 12 Sinn Féin ministers in like
6453020	6458740	in London and they will not vote in anything that isn't specifically about
6458740	6464460	Ireland so people like Scotland try and get them to kind of vote for us a wee bit
6464460	6471300	but they refuse yeah I love the Irish so much but Scotland's good no Scotland's great
6471860	6475420	We've got a female first minister who's amazing
6475420	6480700	Is that the so how is your structure? Do you have a prime minister you call it a first
6480700	6485860	minister? Yeah she's the first minister and basically England pretends we've got
6485860	6489900	power and she gets to kind of wield it a little bit. England pretends what? We've
6489900	6497760	got power and they pretend yeah well I mean she does nice things I mean we've
6497760	6502200	got the NHS in general but if you're in England you have to pay for prescriptions but if
6502200	6506840	you're in Scotland you don't if you come if you get bit by a spider you're out
6506840	6512320	you're out in the cold but that's because they believe that God bit you
6512320	6515720	it's the only thing it's just like they believe that spiders are like that's
6515720	6523960	like yeah you're like did a spider bite you well get out yeah then God wants you
6523960	6529080	to die. Education costs money in Scotland it doesn't. Colin can you can you cook
6529080	6537040	on a Robert Burns for us? I'd be happy to Jeff. I can quote you some
6537040	6548040	proclamers. I can quote you some rod sure some proclamers. Do you mind if I do the original Scottish
