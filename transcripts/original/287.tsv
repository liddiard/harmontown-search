58000	63000	The first 15 callers gets his bed for $74.
63000	69000	The mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
69000	70000	Yo.
70000	72000	Wake up sleepy head.
72000	73000	Yo.
73000	74000	Rapping in bed.
74000	75000	Yo.
75000	77000	I'm just a rapping sleepy head.
77000	78000	Yo.

92000	95000	So I got to try to be a master of both worlds.
95000	98000	I got to fuck your mama and all the other girls.
98000	99000	Yo.
99000	104000	When I go to the street, thank you for getting me back on beat.
104000	107000	I'm just a Minecraft bed rapping motherfucker.
107000	110000	I fucked your mom like my name was Chris Tucker.
110000	111000	Yeah.
111000	112000	Yeah.
112000	114000	Yes.
114000	115000	Yes, Tucker.
115000	116000	Good morning.
116000	117000	Good morning, everybody.
117000	119000	Good morning, Daniel.
119000	121000	How'd you sleep?
121000	123000	Did you have any great dreams?
123000	124000	Good, yeah.
124000	127000	You sounded like you were having a nightmare.
127000	129000	And you were there.
129000	133000	I was merely a fly who dreamt of being a man.
133000	135000	And now the fly has awakened.
135000	137000	Oh, that's great.
137000	140000	Let's see.
140000	141000	What have we got here?
141000	143000	And then let's get back to bed.
143000	145000	We ordered french fries.
146000	147000	No, we didn't.
147000	148000	All right.
148000	153000	Composite sketches in true crime shows.
153000	160000	I noticed that in all stories, true crime stories,
160000	165000	in which the composite sketch actually plays an active role,
165000	169000	the people are always like, and the sketch came through.
169000	173000	And when you look, and then we found him at the train station,
173000	178000	he looks exactly, you could, it's like they drew a photograph of him
178000	180000	and then they show it split screen.
180000	183000	And it's either, it's like the most information you could get
183000	186000	from a composite sketch is the person's race.
186000	187000	Like that's it.
187000	189000	All it is is just a racist drawing of either a white guy,
189000	191000	a black guy, or a Hispanic guy.
191000	194000	It never looks anything like the guy.
194000	198000	Like if it's a white guy, it looks like maybe the darkness
198000	200000	of the hair is represented.
200000	203000	But they always like do this big thing about how accurate
203000	204000	the sketch was.
204000	206000	It's never accurate.
206000	210000	And police work doesn't seem to work.
210000	213000	Eyewitness accounts are garbage.
213000	216000	So the sketch by nature is going to be garbage.
216000	219000	Yeah, it's pretty crazy how people just get shit wrong.
219000	220000	Yeah.
220000	224000	I think the amount of like, what do you call them,
224000	227000	unjust, what's the technical terms?
227000	234000	The wrongful convictions.
234000	235000	Church for the win.
235000	239000	The wrongful convictions that are turned over.
239000	240000	It's fucking crazy.
240000	242000	Like when we came up with DNA and then we opened that box
242000	245000	and we're like, oh man, everyone in prison is like,
245000	247000	it's like a crap shoot.
247000	249000	It is crazy, but there's a thing called the Innocence Project.
249000	250000	I hope people know about it.
250000	252000	It is amazing.
253000	254000	What was the thing though?
254000	260000	There was some case where the guy was like railing against
260000	262000	the Innocence Project a little bit.
262000	263000	Bill Cosby.
263000	264000	No.
264000	265000	No.
265000	269000	That would be amazing if he just bothered to.
269000	270000	He's like, well, I'm here.
270000	272000	He's just racking him up.
272000	274000	Since my stock can't go down anymore,
274000	278000	I may as well experience being a villain.
278000	281000	I'm trying to do old Cosby.
282000	285000	But no, there was somebody, now I can't remember who it was,
285000	288000	but they were in the difficult position of like,
288000	292000	I don't know, some crazy case and then they were saying like,
294000	295000	you must acquit.
295000	298000	The Innocence Project wanted, they were claiming that
298000	304000	the Innocence Project was pressuring them to fuck, man.
304000	307000	It wasn't quite as simple as, because the Innocence Project
307000	310000	isn't going to want you to plea out necessarily,
310000	313000	but it was like something close to that where basically,
313000	316000	because the guy wouldn't just do the thing that would make
316000	319000	the Innocence Project put another notch in their belt,
319000	322000	they just dropped them like a rock because he was sticking
322000	323000	to his actual convictions.
323000	324000	Yeah.
324000	326000	And I can't remember what the fuck it was, but anyways,
326000	327000	whatever.
327000	328000	I mean, Gandhi was an asshole too.
328000	329000	You can look it up.
329000	334000	Let's not look it up.
334000	337000	Let's dive, let's have a deep dive tonight into what
337000	339000	made Gandhi an asshole.
339000	345000	I think he was racist maybe, like against like maybe some
345000	347000	race that maybe when he was growing up beat up his dad,
347000	348000	I don't know.
348000	350000	Tonight on Harmon Town.
350000	354000	But you know the irony is he would eat, he ate that race.
354000	355000	Tonight on Harmon Town.
355000	357000	He was ravenous for them.
357000	358000	No, I...
358000	359000	You love that race.
359000	362000	But more importantly, we need to understand,
362000	365000	I would urge just, I don't care what we think anymore,
365000	369000	but we got to stop our hero worship.
369000	370000	Who cares?
370000	375000	Gandhi, I'm sure, he probably owed somebody money.
375000	377000	He probably cheated at cards.
377000	378000	And he loved eating that race.
378000	379000	Who cares?
379000	381000	He did a good thing.
381000	384000	If somebody makes an album and it's a good album,
384000	387000	then you find out that they're a bad unicyclist and all
387000	390000	of a sudden the fucking world falls apart.
390000	394000	Let's just assume everyone sucks and then we'll be like,
394000	397000	we're just grudgingly interacting with anyone.
397000	400000	So it's like, yeah, he made that movie.
400000	402000	Yeah, we act like we've fallen from this world where
402000	405000	everybody was, you know, things were so much classier
405000	407000	and more heroic and gilded.
407000	410000	But yeah, we all also know that every time we pop the hood
410000	414000	on any one of these people that survives into the modern
414000	417000	world, like they end up, it's like, oh, God,
417000	418000	they were a horrible piece of shit.
418000	421000	It's like the invitation there should probably be, you know,
421000	425000	we've got to stop expecting people to be either gods
425000	427000	or monsters, whatever.
427000	431000	Also, maybe the inspiration we can draw is that people
431000	434000	are amazing even when they're just people.
434000	436000	So instead of us like judging the past,
436000	438000	we could sort of be inspired by the fact that despite the fact
438000	442000	that Martin Luther King had mistresses and did all sorts
442000	446000	of crazy sex stuff and smoked marijuana that just came out
446000	448000	and also was a co-cat that also just came out,
448000	451000	that we could still be inspired by him.
451000	453000	Yeah, I mean, that's always been a good classic example
453000	457000	because it's like so, it's like, yeah, Martin Luther King
457000	458000	cheated.
458000	460000	He was a philanderer.
460000	461000	He was like...
461000	462000	He was not a perfect person.
462000	466000	Okay, it was like, and it's like, God damn, can, yeah,
466000	468000	like, I don't know, it's hard.
468000	470000	Not bad for somebody who isn't perfect.
470000	473000	The problem is that we invented like all this technology
473000	475000	that we can use to like, it's a black light.
475000	479000	Like we look at each other and then people are supposed
479000	480000	to just be people.
480000	482000	That's what you're saying.
482000	486000	I just think it's crazy because why does someone assume
486000	489000	that because you're good at rallying people to fight
489000	492000	for the rights, you're an excellent husband?
492000	493000	That's the thing.
493000	494000	That's the disconnect that's happening.
494000	496000	And that's the putting on a pedestal behavior,
496000	499000	which is unhealthy and usually comes with not viewing someone
499000	500000	as a real person.
500000	502000	So in a way, it's kind of maybe dehumanizing
502000	503000	after its fashion.
503000	506000	Because it's hero worship because hero worship gives us
506000	508000	and I'm as guilty as anybody.
508000	512000	You want to live in a world where people become the focus,
512000	517000	you know, like individuals so that you can go, okay,
517000	520000	well, if that person turned out to be racist
520000	523000	or a woman beater or whatever, good.
523000	525000	That was a close call because I was going to have to stop
525000	527000	eating meat for a second there.
527000	530000	And we focus on these people and then we go like...
530000	533000	But it's funny, our capacity for...
533000	535000	It doesn't always take the form of cynicism.
535000	540000	Like we collectively, but I think we do it like the wave.
540000	544000	Like we, one section of the Coliseum like rises up
544000	549000	and says, this guy, what was the guy, Comey 2012?
549000	550000	Remember that guy?
550000	551000	Tony, Joseph Kony.
551000	555000	That guy that made that video that pretty much
555000	557000	through no fault of his own just happened to be viewed
557000	559000	by 80 billion people.
559000	563000	And so then like, well, half of the world was like,
563000	564000	this is amazing.
564000	569000	It automatically makes the other half of your body go like,
569000	570000	why is it amazing?
570000	571000	Let's ask questions.
571000	574000	And then the guy ends up in his street in the underwear
574000	578000	in the street in his underwear.
578000	581000	I think that is a very interesting point.
581000	584000	I wonder if there's science to that because you do get a sense
584000	587000	that people tend to bifurcate into like binaries.
587000	590000	It's like, if there's going to be a yes, then there's naturally
590000	592000	going to be a, well, no.
592000	595000	And it's more about like a gut instinct or like a sociological
595000	598000	thing more than it is about the actual facts in a situation
598000	599000	ever.
599000	601000	Yeah, I guess I always feel that way.
601000	605000	Like it's like, oh, I thought I liked so and so.
605000	608000	Like you want to get all in for some reason.
608000	609000	It's easier.
609000	612000	We should recognize it as a truly lethal instinct, though.
613000	620000	This taste we have for admiration of people.
620000	624000	Because it's a prelude to, it's like a vampire bite.
624000	626000	It's like we're hungry for their neck.
626000	629000	And we act just because it's flattering in the first step
629000	632000	that we're not doing what we're doing, which is like,
632000	634000	we're going to hurt that person.
634000	637000	There is this new thing where everyone is swapping out now,
637000	639000	Donald Glover, based on his performance this weekend,
639000	640000	for Kanye.
640000	641000	Poopty scoop.
641000	642000	Poopty scoop.
642000	644000	They're saying on Twitter.
644000	645000	I don't even know what that.
645000	646000	Don't worry about it.
646000	647000	It's all bad.
647000	652000	So it's this idea that like, oh, these people are interchangeable
652000	654000	and Kanye failed us and now we, good.
654000	656000	Thank God that he showed right up.
656000	658000	Donald Glover's right here and we have our rapper.
658000	659000	It's a crazy thing.
659000	663000	And you're like, oh, these two are not related at all.
663000	666000	One person can be having a mental breakdown and the other
666000	668000	person can be having a great moment in history.
668000	671000	And they're not either one are in service to you at all.
671000	677000	So it's crazy to watch us within 24 hours within a week be like,
677000	678000	well, we're done with Kanye.
678000	679000	Who's next?
679000	680000	Oh, how convenient.
680000	681000	He's there.
681000	682000	I mean, it's a total.
682000	683000	Yeah.
683000	684000	Well, that's a look at what we do with our movie
684000	685000	remakes and stuff.
685000	690000	We just go like, oh, uh, uh, uh, breaking bad guy is bald now
690000	691000	because he's not breaking bad.
691000	693000	He should be Lex Luthor.
693000	694000	It's like the dumbest shit.
694000	697000	And that's where that's where racism comes from too.
697000	701000	Cause you go, you go like, oh, if you recognize, if you can connect
701000	704000	baldness as a dot, you sure are going to connect a rapper and blackness
704000	708000	and like specifically Donald is a fan of Kanye and like, yeah,
708000	710000	clearly heavily influenced by him.
710000	714000	But, but like, yeah, it is, it is like fucked up that your brain goes
714000	716000	there and goes, but we've always had that.
716000	718000	It's like, you can only have one Kevorkian at a time.
718000	719000	You can only have one Dr.
719000	720000	Ruth at a time.
720000	722000	One Madonna, like Johnny Carson comes out.
722000	725000	He's going to make a, there's only, there's only five jokes you can tell.
725000	727000	And so who's the slut?
727000	729000	Who tarot card is it?
729000	731000	Is it Madonna or is it Dolly Parton?
731000	734000	Cause of her giant tits or, you know, like through the decades,
734000	737000	Dolly Parton, you kind of see, you kind of pick one, you know,
737000	741000	the concept of Godwin's law, like any Dolly Parton is really just saying,
741000	746000	like, we do pick famous archetypes and just you run with those as like,
746000	747000	what's relevant.
747000	749000	And so the bad one is Hitler.
749000	752000	You can see that Dolly Parton, okay.
752000	753000	She's a good one.
753000	754000	Drop.
754000	755000	What is it?
755000	757000	You keep, you always hated Parton.
757000	758000	Why?
758000	759000	What's your beef with Dolly Parton?
759000	763000	No, I'm just saying she's sexier than Hitler.
763000	764000	Yeah.
764000	765000	I'm going to disagree.
765000	766000	It's controversial.
766000	767000	Yeah.
767000	768000	It is.
768000	770000	I think that it's important to understand this stuff because it's like what
770000	773000	you're, what we're talking about is like this oversimplification or something,
773000	775000	this very late mental laziness.
775000	779000	And like, I think we need to understand the aspects of our human mind that do
779000	783000	that because like, for instance, I don't know, you tend to forget, like you
783000	787000	forget a phone number if you know a phone number is in your phone because your
787000	788000	brain makes a mental shortcut.
788000	792000	It's like your brain's always defragging and trying to do things to save space
792000	796000	and it's making bad judgments and stereotypes to save space.
796000	798000	And we need to understand that.
798000	802000	But I think the concept of even admitting that is like it makes certain people
802000	805000	insecure or not feeling control or have to deny it.
805000	808000	And it's like, no, it's very freeing to understand what's actually going on.
808000	812000	Behind the engine, we just have to, you know, take that into account because we
812000	814000	do have a car that needs to not break.
814000	815000	Right.
815000	816000	Yeah, you could forgive yourself.
816000	819000	You know, you could go, oh, there I go again being human.
819000	820000	I guess.
820000	821000	Oh, sorry.
821000	822000	Change the oil.
822000	827000	I fucked up like because I'm a fucking monkey with a fucking robot brain stuck
827000	832000	into my head by a God that really just as experimenting as he goes.
832000	837000	And I'm like, I'm wound up and I'm like not used to living in concrete instead of
838000	839000	a jungle.
839000	841000	And I fucked up.
841000	843000	I'm a monster right in that moment.
843000	845000	So like, yeah.
845000	846000	Yeah.
846000	847000	Because we also here's the other thing.
847000	850000	We don't know how to cope with happiness either for the same reason.
850000	851000	Like we get in there.
851000	852000	Yeah.
852000	854000	Are you learning how to cope with happiness?
854000	855000	Getting there.
855000	856000	Yeah.
856000	857000	I got the therapist.
857000	858000	The therapist ordered.
858000	859000	She didn't order me.
859000	860000	She told me that's the last thing.
860000	863000	Like I got to, I have to learn how to process happiness.
863000	866000	You want to, you want to go to the Buddhist temple with me tomorrow?
866000	867000	That's not how you process happiness.
867000	868000	You fucking hippy.
868000	869000	Wow.
869000	870000	Sorry.
870000	871000	Sorry.
871000	872000	He's right.
872000	873000	He's right.
873000	874000	He's right.
874000	875000	He's right.
875000	876000	He's right.
876000	877000	He's right.
877000	881000	I saw Spencer going into egg slut one morning.
881000	883000	Oh yeah.
883000	888000	And he yelled at me and I heard a yell that sounded like Rob Schwab.
888000	889000	And I was like, Rob Schwab.
889000	891000	He doesn't be in Glendale.
891000	892000	And I turned around.
892000	893000	It was like seven o'clock in the morning.
893000	894000	Yeah.
894000	896000	And it was some other car that I didn't recognize.
896000	902000	And I didn't see him, but I was like, I'm certain that was a Rob Schwab noise, but I
902000	904000	don't see any Rob Schwab sources.
904000	908000	I screamed egg slut as you were going in there.
908000	909000	What did I think you said?
909000	911000	I texted you what I thought you said.
911000	914000	You said, I thought you said exit.
914000	915000	Exit.
915000	916000	Exit.
916000	917000	Yeah.
917000	920000	I thought some, like my first instinct was someone was telling me to leave.
920000	923000	Well that makes more sense than calling a business egg slut.
923000	924000	Yeah.
924000	925000	Slut.
925000	926000	Yeah.
926000	927000	They like to call it slut.
927000	928000	I always knew you were such a slut.
928000	929000	How much do you?
929000	930000	Such a slut.
930000	932000	All these videos now that, that, that Glover video.
932000	934000	I know you're such a slut Spencer.
934000	935000	You're an egg slut.
935000	936000	I love eggs.
936000	937000	I always knew.
937000	938000	I always knew.
938000	940000	I could always tell you you're such a little egg slut.
940000	941000	I'm so loose with eggs.
941000	943000	You're so slutty with those eggs.
943000	944000	Egg slut.
944000	945000	Next to VL4.
945000	947000	I want to know what Dan's thought was.
947000	951500	Well, I just wonder, I just wonder the, I have the old school question about it, which
951500	953500	probably doesn't even apply anymore because I think it's kind of.
953500	956500	These are real names of businesses.
956500	957500	I'm just wondering.
957500	958500	Egg slut.
958500	959500	Wondering is.
959500	960500	Texaco.
960500	961500	Yellow fever.
961500	962500	Baskin Robbins.
962500	965100	What is going on?
965100	970500	What kind of pop goes the world bullshit are we living in?
970500	976620	Spencer, my dungeon master's walking into egg slut as I'm on the way to LA fitness to
976620	977620	do pushups.
977620	978620	In Glendale.
978620	979620	In Glendale.
979620	980620	Yeah.
980620	981620	I just wonder.
981620	982620	And the world keeps on turning.
982620	983620	It keeps turning.
983620	994620	One day turns into the next day and now I'm talking about my dungeon master going into
994620	1000620	egg slut before I go into LA fitness to do pushups.
1000620	1001620	In Glendale.
1001620	1005620	It's the promos for pushups.
1005620	1006620	Good thing George Carlin's dead.
1006620	1007620	You're the new George Carlin.
1007620	1008620	I know.
1008620	1009620	I know.
1009620	1014340	There can't be two old white guys doing this.
1014340	1016140	You think I'm white?
1016140	1017740	You were saying you'd watched a bunch of videos.
1017740	1018740	No, no.
1018740	1019740	I don't know what all these Donald's lover videos are.
1019740	1025100	I watched a childish video and I was just, I'm just, I'm just find myself wondering because
1025100	1026100	I'm 45.
1026100	1034100	Like, wait, do you think, is it, are the, are the, are the, are the, are the one-ers,
1034100	1035100	one-ers?
1035100	1036100	No.
1036100	1037100	Okay.
1037100	1038100	That's all CG.
1038100	1039100	Oh yeah.
1039100	1040100	Is there some compositing?
1040100	1045580	Well, I'm sure there's nothing really went in front of the camera, but I mean, there
1045580	1049820	was one when they go with just before, I mean, if you sit down and look at, if you look at
1049820	1054780	something like Birdman, if you're watching for it, you could kind of say, oh, they probably
1054780	1055780	did there.
1055780	1057540	It's like a calm camera turn or something like that.
1057540	1058540	I'd have to go through it.
1058540	1061980	Well, I'm saying what this looked like, but at this point, do you think if you go through
1061980	1062980	it?
1062980	1066980	Because I remember that's where we were with the call your boyfriend video.
1066980	1069100	Like I was like watching and like, okay, okay.
1069100	1070100	They changed there.
1070100	1071100	They changed there.
1071100	1076300	But, but now I, now I think we're at the point where they might've, you could, you, you don't,
1076300	1081540	you don't have to have a fucking waiter walk through frame in order to like fake a, a one-er.
1081540	1082540	Right.
1082540	1083540	That's true.
1083540	1088620	I mean, I'm sure they did as much of it as humanly possible, just knowing, knowing, knowing
1088620	1090660	those crazy guys.
1090660	1092580	I do not think it was a one-er.
1092580	1093580	Yeah.
1093580	1095180	Yeah.
1095180	1098500	But they made it look effortless and they made it look seamless.
1098500	1104540	So you know, they deserve, they deserve a, a, they deserve a, my thumbs up.
1104540	1107580	I'm going to click on that.
1107580	1108940	Add it to the 10 million views.
1108940	1109940	I just saw.
1109940	1110940	I pulled it up.
1110940	1111940	Yeah.
1111940	1116860	And that's just since yesterday, that's, that's quite until Monday morning when nobody wants
1116860	1117980	to work.
1117980	1119340	That's going to triple.
1119340	1121380	I really got to watch that Atlanta show.
1121380	1122380	Yeah.
1122380	1123980	I watched that one episode, man.
1123980	1125580	Did you like the video that you watched?
1125580	1126580	Yes, I did.
1126580	1127820	I guess you're kind of compelled to be.
1127820	1128820	Yeah.
1128820	1133220	But I like Atlanta for the same reason I thought that was a very interesting music video is
1133220	1136100	just because it's like, I, I don't know.
1136100	1137940	I can't, who could make this?
1137940	1141460	It's like, it's just like, it's, I want to see it because it's like, I couldn't do it.
1141460	1143140	It's from outside your, your world.
1143140	1144140	Yeah.
1144140	1145140	It's from outside your tendencies.
1145140	1146140	It's from outside.
1146140	1147140	Yeah.
1147140	1148140	Yeah.
1148140	1155140	The thing about Glover is like when, when he was just the funny kid on the set, like
1155140	1161140	you still knew he had a 350 IQ and there was always something frightening underneath about
1161140	1162140	it.
1162140	1168260	Like, because he was just so fucking smart and, and you could see that he, he would just,
1168260	1172860	it was like, he was just, he was like a stem cell, but that's not, not the way Bob Dylan
1172860	1176440	was where there's a lot of detractors of Bob Dylan where they go like, oh, all he did was
1176440	1179080	hang out and like learn, learn shit.
1179080	1182160	Like I don't think, I don't think Glover's like that.
1182160	1190080	Like it was just like he was young, but he was like, he's just like, like, like he's,
1190080	1192760	he's a, he could have done anything.
1192760	1199200	And now he's like at that century post and it's like just from outside.
1199200	1201800	That's all you know is that it's lateral.
1201800	1204360	Like it's, that's, it's, it's, it's crazy.
1204360	1209320	Like I haven't watched the fucking show yet, but I, but I watched that video and I read
1209320	1215780	his, his profile piece and whatever magazine was, and it was like, oh, that was always,
1215780	1223000	when you look backwards, you can see so clearly the, the, the growth, but like looking forward,
1223000	1226560	you would never know if you went back in time and you were like, he's gonna, he's gonna
1226560	1227560	do that.
1227560	1231040	Do you ever think you two will make up?
1231040	1232540	I don't think we're fighting.
1232540	1237380	I was trying to start something.
1237380	1241860	I remember him saying in his Instagram and he hoped he didn't, I didn't hate him or whatever.
1241860	1244740	Did you ever reply to anything?
1244740	1245740	I've seen him since then.
1245740	1246740	He came.
1246740	1247740	Yeah.
1247740	1252540	We, we had, we had, we had a little meet and greet, like probably two years ago now.
1252540	1254660	For Deadpool cartoons.
1254660	1257260	It wasn't for Deadpool.
1257260	1258660	A different cartoon?
1258660	1259660	No.
1259660	1261660	Are you sure?
1261780	1265500	It wasn't, we ended up, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we were just catching
1265500	1266500	up.
1266500	1267500	Yeah.
1267500	1268500	Yeah.
1268500	1274380	You see that, uh, that, uh, affinity war, you ever see that show?
1274380	1275380	Yeah.
1275380	1276380	Yeah.
1276380	1277380	Infinity war came out.
1277380	1278380	You're talking about the Marvel movie.
1278380	1279380	Pretty sure he's talking about the movie.
1279380	1280380	Yeah.
1280380	1281380	Infinity war came out.
1281380	1282380	All the guys are in it.
1282380	1285020	Let's do Rob Sharp's top three infinity war spoilers.
1285020	1286020	Okay.
1286020	1287020	All right.
1287020	1288020	Number one.
1288020	1289020	No, no, no.
1289460	1292020	Each one will be separated by an infinity war rap.
1292020	1295780	Hit where you don't, who gives me a beat?
1295780	1296780	We all do.
1296780	1297780	Number four.
1297780	1298780	Wait.
1298780	1302100	Infinity wars.
1302100	1303500	The spoilers are here.
1303500	1308260	It's time to hear what happened in infinity wars before you see it.
1308260	1315780	The infinity gauntlet is, which is shame on you.
1315780	1316780	That could be nice.
1317540	1318540	I'll be like that.
1318540	1319540	Set.
1319540	1320540	You get it.
1320540	1321540	Well, okay.
1321540	1322540	Am I right?
1322540	1323540	What?
1323540	1325980	I said the format is fucking up my shit.
1325980	1329060	Let's start from the, let's start from scratch because I like this segment.
1329060	1330060	Let's take this back.
1330060	1331060	Here's how we do it.
1331060	1332060	God.
1332060	1334980	It's the, it's the, we'll, we'll do a beat.
1334980	1341300	We'll do a beat while I rap and then, and then, and then we'll, we'll, uh, uh, I'll rap
1341300	1342460	for two measures.
1342460	1343460	I think they're called measures.
1343460	1344460	Right.
1344460	1345460	Bars.
1345460	1346460	Bars.
1346620	1348740	The show opens in three nights, people.
1348740	1349740	I'll rap for two bars.
1349740	1351380	Remember like the joke Jeff does.
1351380	1355420	And then, and then, and then drop, drop the bottom out of that fucker.
1355420	1357060	Go dry.
1357060	1361100	And then, and then shrub will do an infinity war spoiler.
1361100	1366540	And then after he, after it's finished, bring that beat back, et cetera.
1366540	1368580	So it's kind of like a ten list effect.
1368580	1369580	These are spoilers.
1369580	1372780	These are things that if you're infinity, these are Rob shrubs, infinity war spoilers.
1372780	1374640	Cover your ears now.
1374640	1376260	They could also be fake spoilers.
1376260	1381540	Cover your ears now and don't spread the spoil after I spoil.
1381540	1387140	Well, what if we're here, you know, as part of a performance we have to give otherwise
1387140	1390220	want to hear these.
1390220	1392900	Someone may not have heard these spoilers is what you're saying.
1392900	1393900	That's on stage.
1393900	1397860	Somebody might not have heard these spoilers and I'm about to spoil the spoilers.
1397860	1401540	So don't retweet the spoilers.
1401540	1408400	Wipe the spoilers, um, like hints about the spoilers because you're just going to spoil
1408400	1417000	it for everybody else in case you haven't seen infinity wars and you want to, you want
1417000	1420220	to be, uh, on spoil spoil.
1420220	1421220	Thank you.
1421220	1424360	Cover your ears now because it's about to get spoiling.
1424360	1425360	Okay.
1425360	1429800	So I'm going to say, let's make this a 10 minute bit.
1429800	1430800	Okay.
1430800	1432520	All right.
1432520	1436220	That way, that way people can fast forward at 10 minutes.
1436220	1440960	I'm just going to say this, that some of the spoilers are kind of dumb and don't really
1440960	1441960	pay off.
1441960	1442960	Wait, what?
1442960	1445800	You're not really going to do actual spoilers.
1445800	1446800	What are we doing?
1446800	1447800	What are we doing?
1447800	1454200	I don't want real spoilers.
1454200	1455360	Only one real spoiler.
1455360	1456360	Two fake spoilers.
1456360	1457360	We have to figure it out.
1457360	1461360	Four spoilers and in, and three of them are going to be vacant.

1583400	1584400	That's Natalie Portman.
1584400	1597400	You bet you didn't know that Scarlett Johansson was pretending to be the bad guy.
1597400	1599400	Was pretending to be Natalie Portman.
1599400	1600400	As a child.

1726400	1727400	But together.
1727400	1729400	Keep away from me you fucking gun.

1730400	1734400	I'm going to use awareness to shoot down his balloon.
1735400	1738400	Using my awareness firing rifle.

1744400	1745400	Oh boy.
1745400	1746400	Okay.
1746400	1747400	We're rusty.
1747400	1755400	I went over by Mike Chili's house and got fucking stoned by his house.
1755400	1756400	Yeah.
1756400	1757400	Just outside.
1757400	1758400	He didn't even know I was there.
1758400	1759400	That's a sketchy area.
1759400	1760400	That's fucked up.
1760400	1761400	I want to do drugs.
1761400	1762400	Why am I not high?
1762400	1763400	How come everybody's high but me all the time?
1763400	1765400	Do you want me to go get drugs to hire you?
1765400	1766400	You don't answer texts.
1766400	1767400	Yeah.
1767400	1769400	Because I met a fan.
1769400	1770400	Answer your phone.
1770400	1774400	I met a fan who gave us this free pot stuff.
1774400	1775400	Oh yeah?
1775400	1776400	Go give me some.
1776400	1777400	Give me a card.
1777400	1780400	What kind of, what situation was it though?
1780400	1781400	What?
1781400	1782400	Because when we were in Chicago.
1782400	1783400	Oh sorry.
1783400	1790400	When we were in Chicago somebody handed me four pounds of edible weed gels.
1790400	1791400	Oh my god.
1791400	1792400	Remember that?
1792400	1793400	Do not.
1793400	1798400	It was after the show and the guy came up to me and had no shoes on and a wet corduroy
1798400	1799400	suit.
1799400	1800400	Oh is that Levi?
1800400	1801400	That sounds like Levi.
1801400	1802400	No wet?
1802400	1803400	It was kind of wet.
1803400	1804400	No shoes sounds like Levi.
1804400	1805400	No shoes.
1805400	1806400	Was it raining outside?
1806400	1807400	No shoes.
1807400	1808400	That part, no.
1808400	1809400	It wasn't raining.
1809400	1810400	So he just like.
1810400	1811400	That's what I was like.
1811400	1813400	I got to go through the pool to get to the show.
1813400	1815400	And he handed me a ton of pot.
1815400	1816400	Is that a thing?
1816400	1817400	Do people hand you pot?
1817400	1818400	Oh yeah.
1818400	1819400	I mean Spencer.
1819400	1825960	Spencer's kind of like a, what we in Minecraft would call a vacuum hopper or what you normies
1825960	1831960	would call a lightning rod.
1831960	1837640	Having a guy on the show that's a little more like, I assume people gave most of the tongue
1837640	1842880	related stuff when they went to KISS concerts to Gene Simmons even though they all had tongues.
1842880	1860400	That was a strange time when KISS was around and Gene Simmons was like the guy that liked
1860400	1861440	sticking his tongue out.
1861440	1862440	Yeah.
1862440	1863440	That was like his thing.
1863440	1868880	He was and like he would stick his tongue out and my mom would go.
1868880	1869880	I know.
1869880	1870880	I like.
1870880	1871880	Terrible.
1872880	1876880	It's almost pointless to say it, but it still makes the mind real.
1876880	1881880	Like when you just look at what our parents were frightened of.
1881880	1882880	And us.
1882880	1884880	I mean I was a kid and I was like boy George.
1884880	1885880	Uncomfortable.
1885880	1886880	You know?
1886880	1891880	Like my brother was into all this cool music like boy George and Prince and all that stuff.
1891880	1892880	We've talked about that before.
1892880	1898880	I was like I'll just stay with my Phil Collins because I just I'm not that confident in my
1898880	1902880	exploring these boundaries that these top 40 singers are exploring.
1902880	1910880	But like and then the things that your parents were like you got to go to a special camp
1910880	1912880	if you had a poster of it on your wall.
1912880	1913880	It's just dudes in makeup.
1913880	1916880	Just like guys that just wanted to look pretty.
1916880	1918880	It's kind of amazing.
1918880	1919880	I mean we all.
1919880	1922880	When you say Phil Collins can I just have what era Phil Collins?
1922880	1923880	SUSU Studio?
1923880	1924880	Yeah.
1924880	1926880	No jacket required.
1926880	1928880	I've been over this.
1928880	1931880	I mean the real thing is that my brother had tasted music.
1931880	1932880	I did not.
1932880	1934880	Phil Collins was great.
1934880	1939880	There was a Genesis 8 track in the basement next to the 8 track player.
1939880	1942880	It was like one of five 8 tracks.
1942880	1946880	So I just listened to the same thing over and over again.
1946880	1951880	So then as I hit puberty and it was like time to get my first album you know because I was
1951880	1953880	like getting hormones in my body.
1953880	1957880	I was like I'm going to get an album for my birthday not a toy truck.
1957880	1960880	I was like I don't I don't have any favorite bands.
1960880	1963880	So I just started tracking fucking Phil Collins.
1963880	1964880	So you didn't like Phil Collins?
1964880	1965880	You were just.
1965880	1975880	No I'm just acknowledging that probably not a lot of people that are you know music musicies.
1975880	1976880	They're idiots.
1976880	1979880	They're probably not like you know now I'm so old it doesn't matter.
1979880	1980880	Phil Collins is excellent.
1980880	1984880	Now it's like being into like a fucking Mel Torme or something.
1984880	1987880	It's like it could be it could be as cool as it is.
1987880	1988880	It could be anything.
1988880	1989880	You know who I like.
1989880	1995880	Who do you know who I discovered late in life that I've been a fan of my entire life because
1995880	2000880	like I was listening to YouTube and it just like you know how it just kind of randomly
2000880	2004880	goes over to the something that has the same tags or whatever.
2004880	2009880	I was listening to some I don't know some 80 song and it just took me to a Billy Ocean
2009880	2017880	playlist and I knew every lyric and I and I was super happy and I and by the time the
2017880	2024880	16 songs were done I was like I guess I'm I'm a big fan of Billy Ocean.
2024880	2026880	He's an ocean of hits.
2026880	2027880	He really is.
2027880	2028880	He really is Dan.
2028880	2030880	I'm not even kidding about that.
2030880	2035880	He has a lot more hits than a lot of people think.
2035880	2036880	He has two hits.
2036880	2037880	No.
2037880	2038880	Two hits.
2038880	2039880	Count them off.
2039880	2040880	Don't do it.
2040880	2041880	Count them off.
2041880	2042880	Don't do it.
2042880	2044880	Billy Ocean's hits.
2044880	2047880	Number 10.
2047880	2049880	Caribbean Queen.
2049880	2050880	No.
2050880	2051880	Okay that's 10.
2051880	2052880	Police shit.
2052880	2053880	What's number one?
2053880	2056880	Get out of my dreams.
2056880	2058880	Get out of my dreams.
2058880	2060880	Get into my cards.
2060880	2062880	Number seven.
2062880	2064880	Because that's it.
2064880	2065880	Oh.
2065880	2067880	Love a boy.
2067880	2069880	Okay all right.
2069880	2071880	Number six six six.
2071880	2073880	Billy Ocean's Ocean of Hits.
2073880	2074880	Number six.
2074880	2077880	There'll be sad songs to make you cry.
2077880	2079880	Love songs.
2079880	2081880	Hold and true.
2081880	2084880	Not a hit. Puppet.
2084880	2085880	You know what I'm doing.
2085880	2086880	I remember it but not it.
2086880	2089880	But he lasted longer than Ricky Martin at this point for sure.
2089880	2090880	He's got a lot of hits.
2090880	2091880	He's got a lot of hits.
2091880	2094880	If you like his music there's a lot of hits.
2094880	2096880	Did you watch the videos as well though?
2096880	2097880	Is that part of mine?
2097880	2099880	You gotta watch the videos.
2099880	2108880	Because inexplicably fucking Love a Boy is a sci-fi video where he rides a horse to a cave and inside the cave is a fucking Star Wars cantina.
2108880	2110880	Fuck you Billy Ocean.
2110880	2111880	I love you.
2111880	2112880	He's just like Han Solo.
2112880	2113880	He's got the white shirt.
2113880	2114880	He's just like let me be.
2114880	2115880	I don't care.
2115880	2119880	I want to be your lover boy but I also want to be Han Solo.
2119880	2121880	I want to get off Tatooine.
2121880	2123880	Cody was wearing a neoprene jacket.
2123880	2129880	She was talking about how she's like I love my neoprene jacket and I call her my bean.
2129880	2134880	And then I was like neoprene bean.
2134880	2137880	Now she's wearing neoprene.
2137880	2138880	And she's like what do you.
2138880	2139880	What do you.
2139880	2140880	That's really catchy.
2140880	2141880	I'm like Billy Ocean.
2141880	2143880	Why do they call it neoprene again.
2143880	2148880	Why is it neoprene because it's not your mom's preens supreme.
2148880	2150880	What what is the texture of the neoprene.
2150880	2151880	Is it soft.
2151880	2153880	It's like it's like scuba suit.
2153880	2157880	It's like a scuba suit slightly spongy sort of sharks.
2157880	2161880	That's what Robert Redford had to wear in order to keep from the heat.
2161880	2167880	The heat detectors from picking them up and sneakers and sneakers.
2167880	2168880	Did you have a little hiccup.

2174880	2176880	But yeah.
2176880	2181880	If there's anything that's three syllables and then a fourth syllable that's separated
2181880	2183880	I always think of Billy Ocean.

2557480	2558480	Oh man.
2558480	2559480	Nice guy.
2559480	2563480	Sorry I drive on the wrong side, mate.
2563480	2567080	Hey, you want some of this?
2567080	2568080	Oi.
2568080	2569080	Oi.
2569080	2570080	Oh.
2570080	2571080	Wow.
2571080	2575440	That's why they call you ocean, isn't it?
2575440	2576440	Oh man.
2576440	2580280	Here, have some of this fucking, this coke is green.
2580280	2581800	Never touch it, Billy, baby.
2581800	2583520	It's not how I got this far.
2583520	2587520	That's why I got two nostrils.
2587520	2588520	They make it green.
2588520	2590320	They make it green now.
2590320	2591320	Is this your mother's?
2591320	2592320	Do you know that?
2592320	2593320	They make it green.
2593320	2595000	Is this your mother's hand dress?
2595000	2597840	Then hey, hey, let me tell you something.
2597840	2600560	My mom died 20 years ago.
2600560	2602520	I don't know who my parents are.
2602520	2605640	Well, Billy, I don't understand.
2605640	2606640	I don't either.
2606640	2611680	I mean, if I know she died 20 years ago, don't you think I would know?
2611920	2616320	My mom's identity, and I would at least know half my parents.
2616320	2621800	But Billy, I'm sorry, it's the cocaine talking, making my eyes green.
2621800	2623800	Look, my hands are growing.
2623800	2624800	Oh.
2624800	2625800	Oh.
2625800	2626800	Oh, Billy.
2626800	2627800	Oh.
2627800	2628800	Oh, Billy.
2628800	2633080	Do you like it when I turned into that demon before?
2633080	2634080	Yes.
2634080	2635080	Yes, Governor.
2635080	2638280	You want to see me do it again?
2638280	2639280	I guess.
2639280	2640280	Yes.
2641280	2642280	Oh, God.
2642280	2644280	He's got a sword.
2644280	2646280	No, what are you?
2646280	2648280	All right.
2648280	2649280	All right.
2649280	2650280	That's great.
2650280	2656280	Can we stop?
2656280	2658280	These events really happened.
2658280	2659280	Good scene.
2659280	2660280	Check out the ocean dock.
2660280	2661280	It's a good scene.
2661280	2662280	Oh, we're done?
2662280	2663280	Okay.
2663280	2666280	I believe that Spencer did bring you something.
2666280	2672800	Yeah, but I've got to say, I tried it outside, and it might not be good for the show.
2672800	2674280	But don't let that stop you.
2674280	2676040	Because it's too rough.
2676040	2677040	I don't know.
2677040	2678040	I'm just high.
2678040	2682440	Well, just a little, I can do less of whatever it is.
2682440	2690600	I mean, I went to Mike's house four hours ago, and I took one puff, and I'm blitzed.
2690600	2692200	I should not have driven here.
2692200	2696200	I know this is going to sound crazy, but it's fucking hot, and I find that when it's
2696200	2697200	hot, you get higher.
2697200	2698200	Oh, man.
2698200	2699200	Yeah.
2699200	2700200	Because you're just like, I'm good.
2700200	2702200	You know I'm fucking high right now.
2702200	2703200	Hell, yeah.
2703200	2704200	All right.
2704200	2705200	Fucking blaze it.
2705200	2707200	420 show.
2707200	2709120	You guys watch Vanity Fair Confidential?
2709120	2710120	I recommend you do.
2710120	2711160	You know we do.
2711160	2712760	We can't get enough of it.
2712760	2715600	I watched the one about the busting of the Silk Road.
2715600	2719920	I was going to watch it, but it said it was confidential, so I just turned the fucking
2719920	2720920	channel.
2720920	2723120	I'm like, I don't want to get in trouble.
2723120	2725320	I don't want the police to come to my house.
2725320	2732440	Internet shit off, and let's just watch the Unconfidential, Vanity Fair, the street legal
2732440	2733440	version.
2733440	2734440	Yes.
2734440	2735840	It doesn't really make any sense.
2735840	2740280	At the end of every one, I always ask, why is that confidential?
2740280	2741280	That was a famous case.
2741280	2742280	Obviously not.
2742280	2743280	It's on television.
2743280	2744280	Yeah.
2744280	2745760	Watch the Gilbert Gottfried documentary.
2745760	2747360	Oh, it's great.
2747360	2748360	Really, really great.
2748360	2749360	Neil Berkley won.
2749360	2750360	Yeah.
2750360	2751360	Really great.
2751360	2752360	Yeah, I saw it too.
2752360	2753520	It was really good.
2753520	2756440	His last movie was better.
2756440	2757440	The previous one to that.
2757440	2758440	The one you were in.
2758440	2761160	No, I liked the one after Harmentown.
2761160	2762160	What's that?
2762160	2763160	I don't know.
2763160	2764160	Holy shit.
2764160	2766040	I was just committing.
2766040	2767040	You're talking about Neil.
2767040	2770520	Well, he did the Harmentown documentary.
2770520	2771520	Yeah.
2771520	2774440	Does he do a lot of documentaries about comedians?
2774440	2775440	He can't get enough.
2775440	2776440	Well, he didn't until Dan.
2776440	2780040	Why do you make a sound like that?
2780040	2781040	He's all up in that shit.
2781040	2782560	He can't get enough.
2782600	2786800	He's a, you know, he's a lapse, a chuckle fucker.
2786800	2787800	Wow.
2787800	2788800	Wow.
2788800	2789800	Neil.
2789800	2790800	I'm Kanye out.
2790800	2791800	Shots fired.
2791800	2794720	Come on the podcast and debate me.
2794720	2796440	Shots fired.
2796440	2799880	This sounds like there may be some history there that I should not dive in to.
2799880	2800880	No, Neil's a great guy.
2800880	2802400	I mean, hey Spencer.
2802400	2804000	He did good stuff.
2804000	2805000	Spencer.
2805000	2806000	That makes him good.
2806000	2807000	Men's words, yeah.
2807000	2808000	Hey Spencer.
2808000	2809000	Yeah.
2809000	2810000	Yes, Rob.
2810000	2811000	Thank you for the dice.
2811000	2812000	Yeah.
2812440	2813440	I love the bag of dice.
2813440	2814440	Thank you so much.
2814440	2818080	I was almost going to ask you point blank, Hey Rob, what was the thing I was supposed
2818080	2819240	to ask you before?
2819240	2823320	I wanted you to bring up this thing that you had did because it sounded really interesting.
2823320	2825480	You had asked me for some dice a while back.
2825480	2826480	Yeah.
2826480	2831240	I asked for some D and D dice and I was like saying, Hey, can you set me up with some D
2831240	2833280	and D dice?
2833280	2834280	It's fine.
2834280	2835280	I'm having fun.
2835280	2836280	What's that?
2836280	2837280	Yeah.
2837280	2838280	I'm just talking during your story.
2838280	2839280	Being rude.
2839400	2842720	I said, Hey, Spencer, this is the text.
2842720	2843720	These are the real words.
2843720	2848360	I could say, Hey, Spencer, Hey, can you set me up with some, some D and D dice?
2848360	2849360	And what did you say?
2849360	2856680	I think I said, what do you need them for D and D. I'm going to be on another podcast
2856680	2858360	doing Dungeons and Dragons.
2858360	2859360	Well, fuck you.
2859360	2861360	Get, get the fuck out of here.
2861360	2862360	Whoa.
2862360	2863360	No, that wasn't the real text.
2863360	2864360	What did I say then?
2864360	2865360	Yeah.
2865360	2866360	Sure.
2866360	2867360	Something like that.
2867360	2868360	Yeah, whatever.
2868440	2869440	Yeah.
2869440	2870440	And then I didn't bring it to the show.
2870440	2872840	And then we, we traded, we, we, we got it.
2872840	2873840	We made it happen.
2873840	2874840	You got those dice.
2874840	2878400	You guys ever tried to watch one of these Adam Sandler movies that he made when he went
2878400	2879400	to Netflix?
2879400	2880400	The Cobbler.
2880400	2881400	Oh no.
2881400	2882400	Like hateful eight.
2882400	2884400	Uh, not hateful eight.
2884400	2885400	Hateful eight.
2885400	2886400	Yeah.
2886400	2887400	He made hateful eight.
2887400	2888400	Somebody tell him.
2888400	2889400	The one that the, uh, Native Americans boycotted.
2889400	2890400	Yeah.
2890400	2891400	Yeah.
2891400	2892400	Right.
2892400	2893400	No, it was ridiculous six, right?
2893400	2896040	Hateful eight was the Quentin Tarantino one, which is why I assume you guys were making
2896040	2897040	fun of me.
2897040	2898560	You're pissed off Quentin Tarantino.
2898560	2900480	I only pissed off Quentin Tarantino.
2900480	2902760	You, you pissed off Lin-Manuel.
2902760	2908880	So I'm in El Coyote and then some disheveled hair hobo comes up to me.
2908880	2909880	Yeah.
2909880	2912480	And he says, Hey, you, you look like you'd be perfect.
2912480	2915360	And I'm like, to give you money, you fat sack of crap.
2915360	2919520	And I punch him in the face, turns out it's Quentin Tarantino and he wanted me to star
2919520	2920520	in his next movie.
2920520	2921520	Oh man.
2921520	2922520	You blew it.
2922520	2923520	I know.
2923520	2924520	I blew.
2924520	2929000	I really, really, really want, I really wanted him to be in the, I really wanted to be my
2929000	2931880	next movie, but he, but he fucking punched me.
2931880	2932880	Yeah.
2932880	2933880	The character doesn't punch.
2933880	2934880	So what the fuck?
2934880	2935880	Fucking Spencer, didn't work.
2935880	2936880	Punch me.
2936880	2937880	It's a fucking fucking bullshit.
2937880	2943080	I just, I just wouldn't put him in my movie.
2943080	2946800	Hey guys, is this seat taken?
2946800	2947800	Oh, shit.
2947800	2950800	It's a veteran character actor.
2950800	2956880	It's a, it's a, it's a, Dean Herrera.
2956880	2960560	I just wanted to know.
2960560	2965000	Fuck you.
2965000	2966920	You were fucking Nick Tortelli from Cheers.
2966920	2967920	Oh, fuck.
2967920	2970080	That was the fucking most amazing thing ever.
2970080	2971080	Yeah.
2971080	2974280	I just wanted to make a fucking Cheers movie.
2974280	2976280	I want to make a fucking Cheers movie.
2976280	2977280	Get it right.
2977280	2978280	Like a chair.
2978280	2979280	There was no fucking, there was no sexy.
2979280	2980760	Then he needed to be fucking sexy.
2980760	2981760	That's not helpful.
2981760	2986760	I always wanted to see him go up to Diane and just go, let me, let me fuck you.
2986760	2988080	I want to fuck you.
2988080	2989080	You know?
2989080	2990840	Like what the fuck was going on in the bathroom?
2990840	2991840	Charentate.
2991840	2992840	You died.
2992840	2993840	Like make a Cheers movie.
2993840	2994840	What's going on in the bathroom?
2994840	3001160	Like fill it with titties, fill it with titties and squirt blood.
3001160	3003240	That's the thing about the seventies is we were onto something.
3003240	3008760	We were, we were, titties were squirting blood.
3008760	3009760	So yes.
3009760	3014060	Now we have pissed him off to answer your question.
3014060	3015960	Have we ever pissed, quittin', tarantined?
3015960	3016960	Yeah.
3016960	3017960	Now we have.
3017960	3018960	Yep.
3018960	3019960	Now we have.
3019960	3020960	Do you see any-
3020960	3024760	Now I guarantee we have.
3024760	3028440	Do you see any kind of spectrum?
3028440	3029440	Has him?
3029440	3030440	Him?
3030440	3032400	This recent meltdown, do you-
3032400	3033400	Can you do one thing for me?
3033400	3034400	Wait.
3034400	3035400	Did he have a meltdown?
3035400	3036400	Yeah.
3036400	3037400	Do one thing for me because-
3037400	3038400	What did he do?
3039040	3043160	So Kanye West has been in the press lately doing different things.
3043160	3048960	He stopped by TMZ where he announced that slavery was a choice, that 400 years of oppression
3048960	3050480	was a choice.
3050480	3057860	And has fired his management, has gotten on and off Twitter in a sporadic way, came out
3057860	3059600	and wore a MAGA hat.
3059600	3060600	Right, right.
3060600	3061600	That part I saw.
3061600	3062600	Yeah.
3062600	3064480	And it's been getting sort of progressively worse as we've been going on.
3064480	3071520	So some people are mad, but what I see is a little bit of spectrum-ish or a little bit
3071520	3074160	of- some people are saying drug use.
3074160	3075160	Meds on and off meds.
3075160	3076160	Yeah.
3076160	3078080	Because we talk about that on the show every once in a while.
3078080	3080880	I was wondering, do you see any of that?
3080880	3082880	Well, sure.
3082880	3083880	In what Kanye's doing?
3083880	3084880	Yeah.
3084880	3085880	Of course.
3085880	3089840	I mean, the alternative would be to go, no, I think Kanye's being completely rational
3089840	3095600	and was born without any neurological balance.
3095600	3096600	I think it's that.
3096600	3097600	I think he's just a weirdo.
3097600	3099600	Have you always seen that?
3099600	3100600	He's always been a weirdo.
3100600	3109200	Yeah, well, he's always been pretty- I mean, how is that a big personality?
3109200	3113600	How many fucking albums do you need to go platinum before?
3113600	3119760	Is there a little bit of a- how much shit did we put up with from old white guys like
3119760	3129640	not to go there repeatedly, but Kanye had so many hits under his belt before he was
3129640	3136040	famous for being crazy, for basically just saying, in most of the context that it was
3136040	3142680	happening in, unless you- I guess him storming the stage at the VMAs, but the VMAs are fucking
3142680	3144480	fake awards.
3144480	3148160	There's not even- you're not even really getting an award for anything, so to come up on stage-
3148160	3150320	isn't that where he did the Taylor Swift thing?
3150320	3151520	You get a moon man.
3151520	3154600	But other than that, it was just like- Oh, that's MTV.
3154600	3160800	He's like, I don't want these floor tiles on the floor for my- you know, being a perfectionist
3160800	3166200	and I was always kind of in his corner because the first place people go is, oh, you're crazy,
3166200	3172400	you're manic depressive, they diagnose you, but who cares?
3172400	3178560	It's a capitalist society, so I got the cure to my schizophrenia right here.
3178560	3186120	It's called I'm a billionaire, and I do think that we don't- Frank, I don't know, this is
3186120	3192000	white guilt talking, but I feel like we unevenly apply that rule to black men.
3192000	3197760	We let them go crazy from getting rich and then we really break out the medical clip
3197760	3203400	boards in a way that we don't with white guys that get rich and go crazy.
3203400	3210760	I think we love all dismantling of celebrity, but it is- this one's interesting because
3210760	3214480	there is that feeling of like, yes, we kind of all knew that he was crazy, I don't know
3214480	3216040	why this is different.
3216040	3220280	You describe that stuff, the difference that I'm hearing is that it sounds sad.
3220280	3221840	It's super sad.
3221840	3226880	The slavery thing and the- you know, it's like- that explains a lot, because I came
3226880	3230680	into- all I saw was him tweeting pictures of his- he's like, yo, does this look like
3230680	3231680	the sunken place?
3231680	3238240	And I was like, that's a little sad, but it wasn't so sad that I wasn't like laughing
3238240	3241920	at it, because it was like, yeah, of course it does.
3241920	3246400	It does look like a corridor of the sunken place, your design choice is-
3246400	3251200	Which you should be proud of, because you bought it.
3251200	3255480	You bought the sunken place, you weren't in prison there by Catherine Keener, so good
3255480	3260600	time for you, but anyways, I didn't know that that was the back story, I didn't hear
3260600	3263080	about that TRL or whatever thing.
3263080	3268000	He took over TMZ, which he classically hates TMZ, he likes to strike out at them, punches
3268000	3272880	their photographers, breaks their cameras, but he went to TMZ and at some point was addressing
3272880	3275520	the entire room instead of just being interviewed.
3275520	3280440	So he stood up and sort of gave in health court, and then later on they sort of had
3280440	3283760	bootleg footage of him doing the same thing and getting to-
3283760	3286960	What do you mean he took over, do you mean like he went into their offices?
3286960	3291320	They will let you, usually they'll have a celebrity sit down between two people, Harvey
3291320	3295200	and a dread dude, and they'll talk.
3295200	3299040	So he was supposed to be facing forward, talking to those dudes on either side of him, and
3299040	3303320	he at one point gets up and turns around and tells this story about why he got liposuction,
3303320	3306720	how he got addicted to opiates, did you see any of that shit?
3306720	3309360	So he stands up and he's like, I had to go get liposuction because I didn't want you
3309360	3313080	guys to call me fat like you did Rob Kardashian, and I was trying to go to the Grammys and
3313080	3315600	I was doing the red carpet and you guys called me fat.
3315600	3319360	So then they gave me opiates and I was taking a bunch of day and then when I went to the
3319360	3324400	hospital because I took too many, they gave me seven and released me, is where he started.
3324400	3326880	So he's having a moment for shit.
3326880	3327880	Right, right.
3327880	3330600	Yeah, that is- But I just noticed that people sort of suspended
3330600	3331600	their- Judgment?
3331600	3335240	Yeah, they were like- Because they were like, well, this is serious.
3335240	3340120	It's like Gary Busey, like where you go.
3340120	3346160	We kind of felt that way about Charlie Sheen, but we were just like, let them go, but yeah.
3346160	3352320	Also there's this crazy thing with Sheen, Charlie Sheen and people were like, fuck yeah.
3352320	3356680	It was a Trump effect where they were sort of like, this is a rallying cry for guys who
3356680	3361560	have wanted to live this way for a long time, in cells basically, which is also a crazy
3361560	3362560	new thing.
3362560	3368440	Because he also, well, I want to examine this, what we experienced when we picture Kanye
3368440	3373320	saying this stuff, because part of it is it's vulnerable.
3373320	3380120	He's saying, he's like clearly, it's like there's a difference between a guy going alpha
3380120	3387840	and like being, there's a difference between he's clearly out of his mind and he's clearly
3387840	3394080	out of his mind, like, oh, how come he didn't know that saying that, saying I could lift
3394080	3400280	a thousand pounds would make him seem weak, but then someone saying like, yeah, I've been
3400280	3405960	really weak lately in a way that is, then you immediately go, well, then I'm on your
3405960	3411640	side if you're being truthful and I don't want you to get hurt, so get off the TV.
3411640	3415880	There's also this rap braggadoe show that makes it difficult to figure out when somebody's
3415880	3416880	being crazy.
3416880	3421960	You just never want a rapper to, I mean, in air quotes, you never want a rapper to, I
3421960	3427600	think this is amazing, but like, it's just not the part of the word liposuction.
3427600	3430640	That's probably been, that's probably the first time that's really been introduced.
3430640	3433560	Nah, man, my image means a lot to me, man.
3433560	3435400	I got a chemical pill.
3435400	3441960	I'm over here trying to get this lipo from my lipo.
3441960	3449040	It's an interesting thing to watch because people are taking, there is this very fine
3449040	3453760	line where you say, are we shitting on this dude because we shit on people at this point?
3453760	3457960	Are we getting out a little bit of racism in that we've never really had the backs of
3457960	3462520	black dudes, so now that one's going crazy who happens to be rich and has been very vocal
3462520	3466560	about how we fucked the system to get rich.
3466560	3467560	Are we doing this thing?
3467560	3471880	I used to watch Jerry Springer and all these talk shows where there'd be a black mother
3471880	3472880	on stage.
3472880	3477600	She'd be being shit on by a white audience for being a bad mother and there was a section
3477600	3484080	of it where you were like, now, wait a minute, some of you all are just being straight up
3484080	3486440	awful about this shit.
3486440	3487440	Some of that is what I've seen.
3487440	3491760	I've seen some people who are taking a potshot at a black millionaire and I've seen some
3491760	3499000	people who have no respect for the fact that we're watching somebody with a mental illness.
3499000	3501880	It's a crazy, crazy thing to watch.
3501880	3503920	Are you fucking with this incel shit at all?
3503920	3504920	Am I fucking with it?
3504920	3505920	Yeah, man.
3505920	3510680	I'm doing my third session next week.
3510680	3520440	We knew, we hate to claim this, but we discovered the incel movement on this stage because Cody
3520440	3521440	found it.
3521440	3527560	Well, going down to rabbit hole and she was, remember that the gazpacho blog guy, he was
3527560	3528560	incel.
3528560	3529560	He was the guy-
3529560	3530560	Hey, get back up.
3530560	3532160	I don't know the origin.
3532160	3538840	Cody found a blog by this guy that, among other things, he had this blog entry where
3538840	3544880	he was behind two women in a restaurant and he overheard them saying, one of them said,
3544880	3549080	oh, good, they have gazpacho and the other one said, what's gazpacho and the other one
3549080	3553440	said, it's like cold tomato soup or something and the other one said, that's gross.
3553440	3559160	And then he said, and that's the moment when I knew I was going to try gazpacho.
3559160	3561440	And then he tries it and he's like, and I loved it.
3561440	3562440	And that's the thing.
3562440	3564000	And it was like, it's just amazing.
3564000	3565000	That's the incel thing.
3565000	3568320	It was like, he was like, so are these gamer gate dudes?
3568320	3569320	Yeah.
3569320	3570320	Same batch.
3570320	3571320	It all.
3571320	3572320	Okay.
3572320	3574920	So it's crazy because they, I don't think you backed up enough.
3574920	3580840	What I kind of know what you're talking about incel community means a voluntary cell, but
3580840	3586400	it's men's right activists and people who, who hate women and have radical beliefs that
3586400	3588920	are predicated on the fact that they're not getting laid.
3588920	3594760	So it all dates back to, I mean, all internet culture comes back to like something awful
3594760	3601160	and this like in video game, cultural circles and four Chan and it kind of spawned a bunch
3601160	3606520	of stuff, but it's just like racism and white supremacy was always kind of just under the
3606520	3607880	surface of that.
3607880	3611960	So I mean, four Chan kind of popped up a bunch of times.
3611960	3616480	They made operations against Scientology and stuff, but they weren't really overtly racist
3616480	3620320	for a long time, but racist factions of them started gaining more steam.
3620320	3624680	And then when the gamer gate thing blew up, that kind of coincided with the pickup artists
3624680	3629040	movement and the men's rights activists movement, which is also, you know, centered in male
3629040	3631960	body building culture and all this online culture.
3631960	3637480	And so that kind of coalesced with this online gaming culture movement and gamer gate.
3637480	3643080	And they just, from there, it's basically everyone on that spectrum is just a different
3643080	3644960	shade of some form of Nazi.
3644960	3649120	It usually comes out of misogyny, but it ends up like expressing itself as some form of
3649120	3650440	Nazi ism.
3650440	3652760	But it's generally under gamer gate.
3652760	3657240	But then people like Gespacho man is probably like he felt empowered because he had some
3657240	3662080	gamer gate related blog where he was like, here's this girl playing a video game on Twitch.
3662080	3664240	And so isn't this the problem with video games?
3664240	3668680	And so like, it's all this like misogynist stuff that comes out of this, this like four
3668680	3672120	Chan culture, but it shows up in all these avenues.
3672120	3676640	But there was in cells during gamer gate and before gamer gate.
3676640	3680480	And they were just made fun of the same way, you know, like losers were made fun of.
3680480	3684600	That's also part of it is like in the culture, you're making fun of people for being losers.
3684600	3688760	And you're also doing that to like hide the fact that you're an anonymous loser as well.
3688760	3690960	And so they're kind of self hating about it.
3690960	3696000	But in cell has like been around forever, but they've just if you could attach a decade
3696000	3698440	to the birth of it, what would you say?
3698440	3700640	Like 2011, maybe later.
3700640	3701640	It's only it's new.
3701640	3702640	Yeah.
3702640	3703640	Reasonable.
3703640	3704640	All this shit goes back.
3704640	3705640	There's a really interesting article.
3705640	3706640	It's like 2000.
3706640	3707640	Okay.
3707640	3708640	Five.
3708640	3712080	I mean, if you really want to like oral history, trace the roots from that that end up blooming
3712080	3718000	into things like gamer gate and all that stuff like the kind of inextricably braided flower
3718000	3727280	stem of, you know, men's men male male rage, for lack of I'm trying to think of the classiest
3727280	3737240	phrase to the like male male fucking alpha energy being bound to video game and internet
3737240	3739080	and hacking culture.
3739080	3744160	Like I can't remember what publication did a really pretty pretty in depth like backward
3744160	3745400	look at the whole thing.
3745400	3746400	What was the guy called?
3746400	3747680	It was like angry uncle though.
3747680	3750560	What was the there was like a there was like a zine at one point.
3750560	3753840	I mean, as you would imagine with any of this stuff, there's like a culture that you can
3753840	3756720	trace back that all starts somewhere.
3756720	3760360	But it's not as if that means that there was a Ben Franklin that started it.
3760360	3764120	But it's always it's always been in all those cultures that think something awful always
3764120	3767200	had racism for Chan always had racist memes and stuff.
3767200	3771960	And it just like it was just circulating and do you think it coincides with science?
3771960	3777080	It seems as if these dudes are not that these dudes are intelligent.
3777080	3781200	And that's a section of the left because I don't even know if they're left.
3781200	3784840	They feel like they feel like they have distance themselves from any sort of political party
3784840	3785840	as well.
3785840	3789240	Yeah, I think they think the bond science.
3789240	3790520	I think it's anger.
3790520	3795280	I think it's it's nerds that grew up watching cartoons that were like you bump into someone
3795280	3796600	and they drop their papers.
3796600	3801120	And then three days later you're having sex with them and you're a loser because you failed
3801120	3802120	to do that.
3802120	3803120	And they're like, I did everything right.
3803120	3805400	I'm bumping into all these women holding papers.
3805400	3808040	And they're like, well, no, you're a fucking idiot if you believe that.
3808040	3811840	But they are fucking idiots who do believe that because we are sending that signal.
3811840	3815280	But it's like I think they're all these people that for so long they're like, I'm a nice
3815280	3816280	guy.
3816280	3817280	Why don't people date me?
3817280	3819840	And it's like, because you say things like that.
3819840	3822560	And but we don't actually sit and explain it to them.
3822560	3826520	But it's like, so there's all these people that for so long think they're doing it right.
3826520	3830200	But it's like, no, you're a jerk and you're a racist and you're a misogynist.
3830200	3833920	And no one's explained to you subtly what that means because you probably don't have
3833920	3838400	a support network because, you know, then that's how people get radicalized is because
3838400	3841680	you don't have a support network and other people are like, actually, it's because it's
3841680	3846680	sort of like it's sort of like it's the syndrome where it's like it's a first world empire
3846680	3849680	and people get comfortable and then there's this shift.
3849680	3854800	If you if you if you stop, if you do start doing anything other than constantly ascending
3854800	3859840	as an empire, I think what happens, what we're observing is that if things level off and
3859840	3865760	then start to get to a point where, oh, this is the third time I heard Time magazine mentioned
3865760	3868920	that whites will be a minority by the year, whatever.
3868920	3873440	And that, oh, college isn't working, like doesn't matter for job placement.
3873440	3878240	And they say the dream starts to fall apart, a dream that if you're 16 years old, you never
3878240	3881840	knew you were buying into, but you subconsciously were.
3881840	3887300	So then you turn 16 and it's like that that that Judge Reinhold monologue in Fast Times
3887300	3891020	where they go, the party's over and he's like he does his monologue and goes like,
3891020	3893460	I'm waiting for the fucking party to start.
3893460	3900340	It's like you like these you can you can be a you can be a white kid and be familiar with
3900340	3905220	these phrases and these concepts that have something to do with progress and the world
3905220	3912260	is getting softer or or progressive or or or it's crumbling and it's melting.
3912260	3918540	And then you like you you just you you just get this high out of going, yeah, but everything's
3918540	3919540	bullshit.
3919540	3924300	That's why movies like The Matrix are in Fight Club and Star Wars and whatever.
3924300	3927900	There's all the stories are about you fucking waking up and realizing that everything's
3927900	3928900	bullshit.
3928900	3932220	And you you got to you got to figure this shit out and that's how you become a hero.
3932220	3933940	Everyone wants to be a hero.
3933940	3939340	And so you're it's one thing to be like in a cradle being fed titty milk from a lamb
3939340	3941420	that whose feet never touched the ground.
3941460	3942540	You can complain about it.
3942540	3943820	I remember you and I talked about that.
3943820	3948140	We were like Generation Xers like like all we knew is that we hated Pepsi.
3948180	3951980	That was it was that easy to be a rebel or just like fuck Pepsi.
3952780	3955540	Fuck. And then it's like, all right.
3955540	3960300	But now I think it gets to a point because I guess somewhere in our heads, maybe we were
3960300	3961780	like, yeah, fuck Pepsi.
3961780	3964780	But then then I'll have a Pepsi later.
3964860	3968060	Like, I mean, and by that, I mean, I'll have a billion dollar corporation later.
3968980	3973860	Like, like I'll like, like, fuck this shit because we watch The Big Chill and we watch
3973860	3975740	The Breakfast Club and we go, oh, I get it.
3975740	3977660	I understand how society works.
3977660	3981460	It goes up a staircase, especially if you're a white dude.
3981740	3984900	Like you you you can complain and be hip the whole way.
3985060	3990220	I think that's where this concept of virtue signaling comes in is that these guys think
3990220	3995860	they're calling out, which is like the only reason you would ever say that shit was bad
3995860	4000260	when you're walking up the stairway to heaven is if you were trying to impress people on
4000260	4002740	the way up. If you're going like, here I go to heaven.
4002980	4009140	It's lame, which is the that's that's what they I think that's what they mean by virtue
4009140	4014660	signaling is that you're going like like I'm part of the liberal hive mind that guarantees
4014660	4023620	that I'll always have dirty money coming in from Podesta's pedophile ring and drone strikes
4023620	4029860	and like like like I'll but I'm also going to make everyone like me and have have sex
4029860	4034500	with all the women because I'm lying to them about how I thought Oprah's speech at the
4034500	4035940	Oscars was just fine.
4036100	4037300	The opposite of a dog whistle.
4038100	4039780	Yes, the opposite of a dog.
4039780	4046540	So are these cats going to do you think they will link up and militarize?
4046700	4049020	Do you think they're going to hook up with the Trump supporters?
4049020	4051260	Yeah, because I think they think they're better.
4051420	4054940	I think they think they're better than the Trump people, the Trump fans.
4054940	4060260	I think they're on a different level where they are more aligned with, say, an evil Bill
4060260	4063540	Gates versus a Donald Trump, but a billionaire nonetheless.
4063540	4069460	But you stop being one of these guys the minute you you admit that you want anything.
4070140	4078420	So that that that simultaneously is good news and terrible news because that's a lot like any
4078420	4085260	terrorist cell, because you basically like the first guy to say, Jesus, these ISIS meetings
4085260	4086340	are so great.
4086340	4088460	I almost don't want to blow anything up anymore.
4088580	4089660	You're out of ISIS.
4089860	4096660	Like like you you you got to just be mad and show up like like and like the fucking great
4096660	4102220	point defeats the purpose if you if showing up makes you express the actual feelings of
4102220	4104460	contentment that you were seeking in the first place.
4104460	4106740	That's a crazy if I can for just a second.
4106740	4110580	That's a crazy point because the truth is we know that people lash out because they're
4110580	4115980	lonely. But when they get together and they have a drive to explode things that yes, they
4115980	4117580	have to get to that final episode.
4117580	4123740	That's what I think fascism is like it's catalyzed by by like privileged people that
4123740	4125100	exploit that phenomenon.
4125100	4129900	Like there's a certain amount of lower class discontent that will recycle itself like a
4129900	4135180	compost bin because poor people will just get sad because they're poor and then their
4135180	4141540	poorness will make them like invent new music and and and and be more religious and and
4141540	4146100	be just generally happier and make rich people go like Jesus these poor people are fucking
4146100	4150220	ecstatic like like I should lighten up a little bit maybe give something to charity or
4150220	4152540	whatever this like like that system.
4154700	4162100	Yeah, that system breaks down when when when shit gets bad enough for long enough that
4162100	4168500	somebody out there usually a 70 year old mummy or like several million of them like
4168500	4173220	they go oh the poor people are doing that thing where they're bummed out about being
4173220	4177820	poor again. I think I'll fucking pour instead of instead of building a wall between me and
4177820	4180380	them and letting them be poor and listening to their wonderful music.
4180380	4186420	I think I'll I think I'll start exploiting their their sadness and their anger because
4186420	4192820	if I go like this they start going like that and then like either money comes in or there's
4192820	4198540	like an agenda like I want that I want that regime taken down and then it's like it's
4198540	4204220	an orchestra conducted by fucking dangerously stupid selfish sociopaths who are just like
4204220	4210420	I think I think I think this guy over here it says that poor people shouldn't be as angry.
4210420	4218380	What do you guys think and they're like yeah and the and this guy is has the IQ of a fucking
4218380	4224300	handball or he wouldn't have been born rich and so then that's the days that we're in.
4224300	4230660	I feel like like like I dread that we're in a right wing slide into a genuine fascist
4230660	4238780	regime and I also feel like a lot of us are reacting to it by by going oh but Oprah will
4238780	4243620	get elected next and that'll be even worse and like I don't even want to argue about
4243620	4248700	that in your wildest dreams like I'm not if I really thought that was gonna happen I wouldn't
4248700	4254300	be so fucking terrified right now because I also we keep trying to hire someone to clean
4254300	4258340	up the mess when in reality it's probably we were going like this when we were stable
4258340	4263140	this was every eight years do we like just change our minds as a country about whether
4263140	4269220	or not we should have but it's just fucking like 60 years of fucking steady this is called
4269220	4277660	stability and then moving in either direction like all at once is called us you know a movement
4277660	4282140	are we able to fight these dudes or will they burn themselves out or what is the for what
4282140	4287580	do you what is the forecast for these dudes and do you know any I don't know like it's
4287660	4293820	just all these people are like they're so far gone they just got to be told like you know this
4293820	4299220	isn't this isn't gonna do what you want but they don't want to hear that like so I think most of
4299220	4304820	them will just you know not go anywhere the same way most you know racist people just yell at
4304820	4310180	people up most and don't end up killing people but still it generates and bubbles up killers you
4310180	4313940	know like the same like I think it'll still continue to be dangerous but I don't think it'll
4313940	4318380	be more or less dangerous than it ever has been like or not ever I mean obviously we've crossed
4318380	4323060	a point it's gotten much dangerous more dangerous recently but beyond that I don't think there's
4323060	4329480	anything my most optimistic hope is that and this is like still a nightmare the optimistic
4329480	4334700	version of the future which is why I can't wait to retire because it's just no no no world for me
4334700	4343420	anymore is that is that this is gonna get bad enough but the the people are still gonna have
4343420	4348380	enough of a toehold and there's enough of a blue wave whatever however you want to characterize the
4348380	4355460	the pendulum going back the other way but that the pendulum will have no choice but to go we no
4355460	4360780	longer have a sense of humor about this this this this and that and it's gonna make it even worse
4360780	4366660	it's it's it's it's good it's like it's like if you graph it it's just moving towards a super
4366660	4371380	volcano explosion because we're not gonna we're not gonna learn from this fucking experience if
4371380	4377740	we learn anything to lighten up and take people less seriously yeah we're gonna we're gonna be
4377740	4384620	like I don't I don't give a fuck what you have to say about due process or how you're you have a
4384620	4390420	story to you said this word and this word is connected to this word and that school of thought
4390420	4397500	and you're fucking toast forever wrong tweet at the wrong time motherfucker done and like like
4397660	4404540	that society will progress along those lines because we won't have a sense of humor about like why
4404540	4410220	would we why would we they're fucking Nazis I feel like we got tricked into respecting people's
4410220	4415180	opinions I feel like the idea of oh respect everyone's opinions like but it's right why
4415180	4421780	why why why would we do that we're just gonna respect everyone's opinions our opinions like
4421780	4427300	assholes and everyone has one and they all stink that's what we respect is that everybody has this
4427300	4433980	smelly bullshit no opinions are terrible and they need to be terribly well-defended before we
4433980	4439660	should accept them as anything I think that sucks though it's not just opinions you're thinking of
4439660	4443860	all of society being people in togas talking about how the world should run in between these
4443860	4450340	ionic columns it's like what about fantasy what about the fact that vice just ran their second
4450340	4459260	article within a month about how some Rick and Morty fans have too much incest on their minds
4459260	4466340	those are people who have their opinions overly respected the the the Vice magazine or the yeah
4466340	4472660	the Vice magazine writers who got away with that okay it's not that much of a stretch because we
4472660	4482980	all know that fucking Pornhub is nothing but incest along with like as we go as we guild up
4482980	4490980	for fighting Nazis week we also are like we are we're not learning the lesson here and I'm not
4490980	4497020	saying it's an easy lesson to learn I don't I'm not lecturing anybody or saying that I have the
4497020	4501500	solution or that I'm not exactly along with everybody that's doing everything but like let
4501500	4508460	them finish right we're becoming intolerant like as we fight intolerance we it is a steady slide
4508460	4518220	because like like I like I'm ready to retire because like I read that Vice magazine article
4518220	4525420	and it was like they dug up quotes from me about kink shaming and incest porn or whatever and they
4525420	4528900	were like here's what Dan Harmon had to say and it was kind of like the article was a little bit it
4528900	4533900	was responsibly written like I didn't feel like the person was trying to come at it was trying to
4533900	4537620	take me down yeah because I feel like if they could have they I mean if they wanted to they
4537620	4544660	they easily could have they included like giant passages of me talking so that I was clear and
4544660	4549580	contextual and they it felt like a responsibly written thing but at the same time I couldn't
4549580	4555300	help but feel like the kid that wrote the article is born of a new world where he he was basically
4555300	4563220	only able to entertain the idea of freedom of fantasy and taboo online as as in the same
4563220	4568380	category as the least likable taboos themselves where the hippest thing you could do is go well
4568380	4573500	some people believe that instead of what it was 15 years ago which is the hippest thing you could
4573500	4580220	do it'd be to go some people are turned on by that and and and and it's just increasingly becoming
4580220	4588820	like because like like that we're gonna we we we we can read each other's minds now and everything
4588820	4595460	that we say and so now we're just like it's not resulting in us loving each other anymore it's
4595460	4607140	resulting in us like like getting off on on learning what a perfect person is by virtue of pointing out
4607140	4612860	every everything that everyone else is doing like we're not looking within and we're not like
4612860	4618220	admitting anything to ourselves we're not like we're not we're not we're not relaxing anymore
4618220	4625220	like the thing that would fucking that you want to be able to weaponize and point at this right wing
4625220	4634260	movement like a fucking cannon is is levity is is is is awareness and a high IQ and humor because
4634260	4638260	they are in a full state of panic yeah I mean because that's the thing that yeah those guys
4638260	4644660	like you can you think they control us I mean you wouldn't believe how much we control them if we
4644660	4653580	were like fucking actually cool with each other and ourselves if you if it's not being fucking
4653580	4659380	triggered by words frankly you cannot fucking stand as I've said a thousand times at a protest
4659380	4666660	against Nazis and here's someone say something mean to his wife at the fucking Nazi protest and
4666660	4673260	be like you know like like hey stop the stop protesting the Nazis this guy is like being
4673260	4678500	really mean to this this lady and and then someone else shimes in it goes did you just call him a he
4678500	4685380	because that's my friend and he's a trans gender and every like we're trying to prove that we're
4685380	4693340	like fighting for good by fighting each other and there's a there's Nazis over there I just want to
4693340	4705220	like 9-11 just like wait wait what was oh what if we start a fire it's like a reenactment of every
4705220	4715340	night right now don't break the ball don't break a point I've been making for three years shop please
4715340	4721700	you two cents I'm too sensitive you're two cents please Rob you're two cents you're two cents
4721700	4726780	because you care about things I do care about things I heard you talk about the meat and the
4726780	4732100	vegetarianism do you have an incel version of that do you guys have people that you fight against
4732100	4737980	like we fight against for race for sexism in the in the vegetarian world are there well the thing
4737980	4752100	that I was surprised at when I I'm so sorry we're out of time anyway no no the thing that I was the
4752100	4759500	most surprised of when I went vegan publicly was the amount of hate that I got which I was like
4759500	4768140	what why would you the minute I would say was that all sides yeah pretty much you know like I
4768140	4774500	mean I don't know what Democrat liberal yeah oh yeah yeah yeah for sure sure sure sure mostly dudes
4774500	4781620	okay mostly dudes like if I said something like I why is hunting still a thing and what you know
4781620	4789620	I'm anti zoo you know I'm anti puppy farm and that kind of stuff and you know I I say you know like to
4789620	4797220	consider an option instead of having bacon on your ice cream and and and there's just lots lots of
4797220	4802020	hate don't tell me what to do and I don't like being you know just like just like they felt like
4802020	4809260	they were being attacked because I said this is this is important to me I used to not think this
4809260	4816740	way I had a click inside my head that made me understand like what I was eating had a history
4816740	4822540	to it that wasn't just like just showed up yeah there was there was suffering behind it and I
4822540	4828420	didn't want to be responsible for that and I and and I got a lot of anger towards me just wanting me
4828420	4833540	to shut up do you notice that when people stand up for rights there is this I didn't notice this in
4833540	4837620	the past maybe because I wasn't there but there's this thing people immediately think about what
4837620	4844420	they're gonna have to do without yeah exactly I mean when I say something that hits too close to
4844420	4849820	home like yeah you know you put bacon on your ice cream did something have to live in pain and fear
4849820	4857260	and die horribly for you to have that little bit of on your ice cream how was it worth don't we also
4857260	4863140	though and so and so I didn't that just shaming someone though wouldn't someone then feel attacked
4863660	4871020	what are you had to kill something to eat dessert like that is attacking someone well tell me how to
4871020	4879420	not shame somebody other I mean to consider to consider like where where it came from I mean
4879420	4885140	that is the trick the trick really what is it you know I mean I haven't done it right because I get
4885140	4890020	people angry and I don't want to shame anybody because that's the quickest way to have somebody
4890020	4897220	shut you down or yell at you or turn you off or ignore you or whatever I just I used to think one
4897220	4907220	way and then I was when I realized what I was doing and becoming a part of I it just it was it
4907220	4914780	was a big turn for me so I was it imagery or did you see processing it was a friend of mine died
4914780	4925940	and I started looking at life and death differently and I got my dog who I adore and I remember like
4925940	4934500	I I started posting puppy pictures ironically on Twitter but then I started admitting I actually
4934500	4940180	really like this and then I started putting all kinds of animals on there and then somebody said
4940340	4948260	you're obviously vegetarian you love animals and and somebody says he's not vegetarian he still
4948260	4955460	eats meat Rob why don't you know calling me out on it and I was like well yeah I say I love animals
4955460	4960900	why am I being a part of this and it just made me do a lot of research and and and then something
4960900	4968300	just clicked inside of me and then I just I could not be a part of it anymore and it's just something
4968300	4976220	that I I feel if because I've had this experience when I've you know wrote about it or posted
4976220	4980460	something about it there there's like a bunch of people that have written me and said you know I
4980460	4985700	never thought of it that way until I started seeing your post I started reconsidering a lot
4985700	4992460	of stuff and I I'm now vegetarian or I'm now vegan or whatever and I'm thinking differently
4992460	4997180	and I felt like I accomplished something so that I guess that's the right way to do it but I don't
4997180	5005180	want to shame anybody I mean I don't want anybody to be feel bad I mean like I used to eat meat for
5005180	5013740	45 years my parents still eat me you know Kate still eats fish I shaming anybody is is not gonna
5013740	5019940	do anything no wonder I wonder if there's a part of us that has a response to discipline because
5019940	5025820	what I heard you say was that you took an idea on and then put it right to use immediately we have
5025820	5034820	a response to change like like willy-nilly change so we the same amount of energy that you feel
5034820	5040380	going into a force field when because I want to get a little bit underneath this because yeah we
5040380	5044780	could talk about the social dynamics of like catching more flies with honey and like oh the
5044780	5049940	way you should do it is to prepare a nice pasta dish on Instagram and tell people how happy you
5049940	5054380	are what you're eating and lead by example but I want to get underneath that because then the
5054380	5059740	Malcolm X of veganism would say fuck that I'm not gonna play nice just because of blah blah blah I
5059740	5067540	I think way down underneath it is basically we don't like people when the other people when
5067540	5076940	they're activated and it's not because we want them to fail it's because we we're all like these
5076940	5085100	sperm cells like headed for what we perceive is the same egg maybe or we we just or maybe it's
5085100	5090860	just more simple than that like a primate survival jealousy needs to keep what happened yesterday
5090860	5095260	going today that's part of your job as a primate and the other half of your job is to want to be a
5095260	5103180	hero so so if someone's popping off next to you about how everything should be different you're
5103180	5108180	hearing it's not that you have ill will for that person it's just that it's like well first of all
5108180	5115780	you're fucking with half my job which is to make sure yesterday happens again today a thousand
5115780	5122300	examples of that make you a hero by the way like being a good person you know the certain traditions
5122300	5128300	that actually are that we praise people for honoring and like knowing the alphabet and stuff
5128300	5132900	like that but then you're also fucking with the other half of my job because to the extent
5133140	5138940	that I wanted to like bring change I wanted to bring it to other people I don't want to fucking
5138940	5145820	be told that it's time to change it that makes me feel like it feels like sin to us which I kind of
5145820	5154220	admire about our species how do you how do you do what I want to do which is not make anybody feel
5154220	5159860	bad I want somebody to I just I very boring answer is that is that you don't have you shouldn't do
5159860	5167100	anything differently it the only thing for your own personal satisfaction would be to not take it
5167100	5171660	personally the way the reaction that it causes because before I would tell you I would have to
5171660	5178300	be your vegan evangelical coach to come up to a level where I was like you know the best way to
5178300	5185980	do it to keep people from throwing tomatoes at you is to blah blah blah I'd find with the tomatoes
5185980	5192300	I'm more concerned about like Spencer who who felt like I was shaming somebody because of the
5192300	5199780	ice cream bacon analogy I mean like I don't want Spencer's just pointing out that an activist by
5199780	5205340	definition is always gonna it's always gonna cause I don't know that's necessarily true well I think
5205340	5212100	that it's hard to argue for not eating animals if your argument is because it hurts animals because
5212100	5216860	that's telling you someone that they're not being compassionate enough I think there's other reasons
5216860	5221340	that you can argue for it that don't involve that and I'm not saying you have to I'm just saying that
5221340	5227980	like like there are more than one ways to advocate that aren't inherently attacking someone but a very
5227980	5233580	common one is a way that assumes everyone thinks the same way as you do and that way you say
5233580	5237660	something that then could unintentionally attack someone who doesn't assume the same things as you
5237660	5244500	are my sister who is amazing activists right what she always likes to do is trade so what you're
5244500	5249260	what you're trying to get something out about why someone should be a vegan you're supposed to say
5249260	5255380	your high blood pressure will no longer be an issue it's to give them the power of choice instead of
5255380	5261260	saying because I get that yeah look people see through that shit immediately yeah that with race
5261260	5269100	they get even angrier because they're like well I have it my feeling about that is that's one
5269100	5278380	tactic is like okay well I'm saying it would be if we were all empathy if we were empathetic to
5278380	5287540	all life maybe we'd be empathetic to each other that's true and I and I think you know if we're
5287620	5295700	going well I stopped eating meat I don't care that the animal is goes through whatever but I
5295700	5303140	stopped doing it because I'm thinner now seems like not a very normal here's how my therapist
5303140	5309020	defines trust says does the part do you believe that the person has your best interests at heart
5309020	5313900	it doesn't even have to mean that they're like they would take a bullet for you or anything it's
5313900	5319900	like do you do you think that they have your best interests at heart which like okay so I
5319900	5325180	don't trust those guys that are have a six-pack on the back of my car like as I come out there's a
5325180	5330940	7-eleven parking lot like I don't trust them like I they're behaving in a way that makes me think
5330940	5336100	that they don't have my best interests at heart so they can say everything they want about about
5336100	5343980	why I don't trust them but they're strangers what I want to know like why why can't I say you
5343980	5349900	shouldn't eat meat because animals feel pain and fear death because the person doesn't trust you
5349900	5354940	that you have their best interest at heart because what he's saying is the inherent implication is
5354940	5359260	that they don't have compassion so they're saying if I let this person into the parking lot of my
5359260	5367420	7-elevens life like I could get mugged I could end up exposing myself like if I say okay I'm
5367420	5375580	interested in being more open-minded about this topic are you gonna enter the lobby of my life
5375580	5380580	and then just start moving fucking plants around because you might be a shitty decorator you could
5380580	5387420	be the rightest person in the world about how my lobby needs to be unlocked but you may suck at
5387420	5392420	decorating lobbies or you may be the best fucking lobby decorator for someone in a completely
5392420	5400260	different building and like in any case like like I have to stay me and and grow I can't just like
5400260	5406860	fucking let you in like a fucking virus and reprogram my nucleus or I'm a bad person that could end up
5406860	5413940	hurting other people so so I need to trust you and and and like it's so when it's it then we have
5413940	5421380	these social cues that we can use to let people know that they can trust us it's it's that's I
5421380	5430020	think to me that's job number one in all interaction is like try to let the person know that as far as
5430020	5436860	you're concerned like you you you don't you you're not out to hurt them but it's hard because if you
5436860	5441540	just say that that's what a serial killer says like Ted Bundy war I don't know I get a lot of
5442500	5449180	like you think you're you're better than me because you are like that I was like no no no
5449180	5453620	because well that's why I said that is because you were you were bringing up that people give you a
5453620	5459780	lot of pushback and so if people are giving a lot of pushback I you know I experienced it myself I'm
5459780	5464740	sure I've tweeted stuff back at you and that's what I was experiencing in those circumstances
5464740	5469780	where it's like yeah this is what you're doing you're throwing a lamb into a wood chipper it's
5469780	5475780	like well no I'm hiring someone to do that for me it's not the same but you know it's so that's me
5475780	5481060	pushing back at an argument right you made and so that's fine if you want pushback but you were
5481060	5485660	saying that it's bad that that happens to you and so that I was saying I was surprised right yeah
5485660	5495500	that that which I I mean I was like wow I didn't realize that this it was not just me saying you
5495500	5501740	should stop doing this it was just me saying I'm vegan it would be like just being at a restaurant
5501740	5505860	with a bunch of people and then I'm saying I'm vegan and then I would pull up my wallet and they
5505860	5511260	go which got a little other wallet they everybody jumps on that and I'd be like actually it's not
5511260	5518340	leather it's it's leather it's it's not I made sure to get it like because I don't want to be a
5518340	5525460	hypocrite that's why I stopped with dairy because it's if I'm gonna go vegetarian and I
5525500	5532620	do a little bit of research you should really go vegan all the way there is the hardest thing
5532620	5537260	about it I'm sorry what her thing about it was which I think a lot of people go through it's
5537260	5542700	like I don't think I can live without a hamburger I don't think I can live without cheese that was
5542700	5549540	the thing that that I was like really I can't that's not really a good excuse and then it took
5549540	5555900	like maybe like three weeks for me to break out of that habit this is why this is why I think it's
5555900	5562380	related to discipline because your ability to take on a new idea and execute it has something to do
5562380	5566900	with your discipline when you bring it up to people I think they immediately feel called out
5566900	5573260	on their personal discipline so it's a it's a difficult place to start I also think I think
5573260	5579100	like I said I think people want to know what is the benefit to even entertaining the ideas
5579100	5584220	that you're giving me so I think that is the game sometimes you know yeah it's interesting
5584220	5588300	I'm on this the reason one of the reasons I'm fascinated by this is I'm on the Facebook a lot
5588300	5593820	I'm in a Facebook group that is Los Feliz Acro Park Silver Lake it's the neighborhood group
5593820	5598940	sorry about that and and people will get on and do exactly what we just did where somebody will
5598940	5604460	say I don't like when people ride their bikes on the sidewalk and you get pushback and it's the most
5604860	5613580	it's the any any point of view almost you know we go like like window of like you see it all
5613580	5619900	the time now with like the woman thing like what somebody goes like so and this is a profile of a
5619900	5627740	woman who says when she was 13 Johnny Depp I'm making this up don't sue me like a riffing one
5627740	5633660	Johnny Depp picked her up as a hitchhiker and he fingered her and and then he made her be his
5633660	5638460	personal assistant and he never thanked her and she got pregnant he talked her into an abortion
5638460	5643180	and it's like it's like this whole like like the part of your brain that goes from oh that's hot
5643180	5653020	goss to like I gotta police this it I think it's linked somehow like like and I started putting
5653020	5659740	road flares on it where I'm like wait if this woman who's 40 saying when she was 13 Johnny Depp
5659740	5667180	did this or whatever like if I don't police it if I don't pipe up and go give me a break first
5667180	5672780	of all I believe you second of all like why are you hitchhiking if you didn't want that you know
5672780	5680300	it's like it's like it's like we it's almost like yeah we hate women but also like there's a there
5680300	5687100	could be a deeper problem here that's actually like just becomes racism sexism um closed-mindedness
5687100	5694540	dog dogmatism uh fucking like just just general bad humanity yeah that hasn't been tested at this
5694540	5699100	many rpms because there's been no internet there's a little conditioning where we just like we need
5699100	5704940	to like we need to memetically evolve a little bit to get we the same way that we realized carbs
5704940	5709900	and glutens or whatever we go through phases we're capable as a society of going you know what's bad
5709900	5715100	this thing that you've never heard of before yeah we have this tendency when we receive
5715180	5722620	communication we're we're running a little bit of an outdated force field protocol where it's still
5722620	5730380	just as dangerous as ever to trust anything you hear but there's a difference between not trusting
5730380	5739740	things being a skeptic and being um a cop you know like like like yeah like lashing out and reacting
5739740	5746380	as if if you say nothing and the person next to you says i deserve all the pants if you say
5746380	5752620	nothing do your pants teleport off your body right right because the bad guys certainly are afraid of
5752620	5759420	that and you know what that's why they're bad guys because they're right because when they're
5759420	5765100	what they're afraid of is if everybody starts saying i want the pants to be evenly distributed
5765100	5770460	they will lose some of their pants they have a valid fear that makes them the death star
5770460	5775820	we have an irrational fear of it when we when we're dealing on a human level like we like we just
5775820	5781260	don't want to like we think that if we don't get mad when you get cut off in traffic that everyone's
5781260	5786060	going to start cutting you off in traffic and there's just no science to back that up in fact
5786060	5791260	what's going to happen when you fly into a fucking right it's actually well no you finish that idea
5791260	5795500	because i think you're gonna cause more you're gonna get more of that you're also gonna lose
5795500	5803100	your general yeah like like uh uh uh fucking uh appreciation of good driving like you know like
5803100	5807340	i feel myself getting worn down listening to true crime podcast where i'm just like boy the bad guys
5807340	5813100	really kind of just get away with it don't they say if i have to hear one more detective on his
5813100	5819660	68th birthday um with with half of his face removed from some uh skin cancer procedure that
5819660	5826860	he was barely able to pay for with his pension uh explaining to me that because uh some dude
5826860	5833180	is about to get injected with chemicals tomorrow on his 90th birthday after raping and eating like
5833180	5840620	48 people for 70 years like i i just and that justice has been served like yeah you know that
5840620	5846460	sooner or later they don't get away with it i'm like he got away with it they get away with it
5846460	5851660	the guy they just caught in california who was a cop who started killing people uh as a cop
5852460	5859260	as a cop he was a cop the internet is and they found out about it way too late the internet is
5859260	5865820	showing us something that we were able to we we had we evolve a certain amount every time we
5865820	5870460	you know you invent the campfire people come around you invent plumbing you get exposed to
5870460	5875580	more and more people there's varying levels of internetness the humanity each level we're like
5875660	5880860	fuck so many new people so many new ideas i'm gonna go fucking insane this is crazy
5881900	5886540	my neighbor used to be a bear and now it's just fucking arab i don't know what is happening to me
5886540	5892540	like i gotta figure this out like we always then just barely like like it'll be a profit or it'll
5892540	5897420	be some kind of movement or it'll be a horrible collapse and a rebuilding like we'll keep up with
5897420	5906540	it the basic late motif is we just keep learning and increasing resolutions that uh there's more
5906540	5915180	bad than good in the world like like we we can see it more you if you if you put if you if you
5915180	5920940	invent a camera that can see everything in the universe it's gonna pick up more bad than good
5921580	5926060	yeah we're living in a real-time library where we're very instead of it being something that
5926140	5930540	we would have read about 10 years ago and been like that was fascinating we're actually like
5930540	5936060	holy shit we know everything about that shooting we know everything about that genocide we were
5936060	5940700	there we have pictures of it and we get to watch the survivors argue with the other survivors and
5940700	5946940	the one the survivor then turns out to be a bigot later and meanwhile this basketball player that
5946940	5951900	that that nailed a free throw and he was a meme for 20 minutes now he turned out to have dog
5951900	5956860	fights in his basement and it's just like everything built cosbys it's like the camera
5956860	5964060	is everywhere it's it's and but we just we just we're seeing the surface of reality we just gotta
5964060	5970540	like we gotta not let it give us a bad trip like like it's it's okay this is overwhelming this is
5970540	5978060	what we look like we're a squirming mass of flesh there's a lot of like sebum and wiry hairs and
5979020	5985420	nipples that have no reason and this is the naked body of humanity and it's not a wonderland it's
5985420	5991180	it looks like the inharmon naked and and and and and and nipples without reason nipples without
5991180	5996300	reason is a british band i think that i think i was realizing this i was watching some movie that
5996300	6001340	that had something to do with good versus flash guard and uh i was like i think part of it might
6001340	6009100	be class guard i get really disillusioned when i think about like how um oh evil's more powerful
6009100	6014220	than good like it's it outnumbers it and all the stuff but it's like that's actually only a reaction
6014220	6020380	to the uh false impression that anybody ever wanted me to think that good and evil were like
6020380	6028380	this fucking rocky versus drago even matched like which is a fan if you if you thought about good as
6028380	6035580	being about one fifth as powerful as evil in almost any context like one fifth the size one
6035580	6042140	fifth the the advantage like like like because if it's good it's good and it's not evenly matched
6042140	6048620	with the amount of like like like my therapist says that like negative shit like affects your
6048620	6054700	brain five times more than positive shit somebody says somebody says i like that shirt and it's like
6054700	6061500	it just burns off like fucking flambé and a fancy restaurant we evolved to you know have to
6061500	6067500	survive danger so it's like oh is that a grizzly bear probably not like you know you can't say
6067500	6073100	probably not you have to say oh god that's definitely a rock that might one percent chance
6073100	6078380	be of grizzly bear and then you know yeah we're not the we're not the progeny of of the chimps
6078380	6083260	that that we're that we're like you know what we need to give ourselves a break here
6083260	6090220	hate to be a smurf but we are also pre-wired to seek out joy that's we are pre-wired to speak to
6090220	6094940	seek out joy we are but i'll tell you one thing we get a huge amount of joy from is uh being the
6094940	6100060	first person to call it when there's something to be alarmed about like like we have a lot of our
6100060	6107100	joy is like tied into like alarmism we amplify negative outcomes like if you say hey um i'll
6107100	6113020	flip you a coin and if i flip a coin you win two dollars and if you lose the flip you give me 50
6113020	6117900	cents it's like you could do that all day and then on average you will win a ton of money but
6117900	6122060	people will not see it that way people will be like no i could lose some serious money it's like
6122060	6128620	people have a psychological tendency to think that risks are way worse like we definitely do
6128620	6133740	still do seek incentives and find things but to your point i think i mean what you're saying is
6134460	6145180	but that we're not going from giraffes don't have uh 50 good 50 bad perception like they they're
6145180	6152860	just thinking about leaves and shit and they're they they're the worst like we graduated to having
6152860	6161020	a concept of good and bad and we're just we just keep finding out that we perceive good a lot less
6161660	6166140	like it but we should still look at it as a gigantic leap from the hippopotamus which doesn't
6166940	6172380	give a fuck who's good and who's bad and what's good and what's bad like the the hippo has no
6172380	6177500	taste bud in its mouth for that and we have a thousand we just have eight thousand more that
6177500	6186540	taste bad sometimes we get addicted to the fine tuning of our existence you know gotta change
6186540	6193580	those couches these are all dirty we're an alarmist primate species that learn to adapt
6193580	6200460	like a mild amount of pack could we see a couch because we're getting out hunted by by a biological
6200460	6210700	killing machine couch hunters what the biological killing machines what what tuned by man defined
6210700	6215340	and hunt couches and murder does this get you less high as you smoke more or yeah as you get
6215340	6220540	more high it gets you less high that's the thing about weed now less high than you have been
6220540	6226060	you push through you can get so high that you're no longer really high yeah that's what i like and
6226060	6232140	then i like to push through that into being that high again and then it's like 300 percent i like
6232140	6236300	how it hangs in the air it's very fun i don't know if the cameras pick that up but it's cool
6236300	6243100	you know what you'd really like hanging in the air uh-oh blue apron oh shit imagine if
6243100	6248860	a box of food could hang in the air outside your door every day i'm currently eating szechuan
6248860	6259340	chops with fried pork nuts szechuan chops pork nut and their fried it's so sad watching your
6259340	6264300	own brain die like like like like like like like like you just like the simple things or you just
6264300	6269580	like can't riff can't riff food oh come on i can't riff no food and then and then just all the like
6269580	6273820	the celebrities names you just you just slowly forgetting them it's like burning from the edges
6274380	6281180	like like a map in a fucking western like it's just like coming in like oh how do you when that
6281180	6285660	happens to you do you sit there and try to you don't you don't look it up right or ask anybody
6285660	6290700	because you think that you can jump start your fucking dead synapse that that made you not
6290700	6296780	remember jeff bridge's name and the garret do you think there's validity that bridges his name
6296780	6309900	luke eric is luke eric did you know that that brain she die that's brain she die that's that's
6309900	6313740	why we have to acquire wisdom because that's all we can offer these new kids we can't we're not
6313740	6317820	going to be smarter and funnier than that we're gonna we but only the only thing we can do is be
6317820	6325900	like kid take it easy don't eat that berry or do and just don't freak out when you looks like you
6325900	6332220	have three hands yeah you don't have three hands like calm down you're you there's no way you have
6332780	6339020	an opinion about this you're 16 give me some gum did you say that brain she died that brain she
6339020	6344060	died yeah does that make sense like in a context that i'm not getting well it's sort of like it
6344060	6349660	doesn't not make i was being like kind of nautical i guess with a scotch of jamaican i got that then
6349660	6357100	okay that day bob marley but with robert robert shaw the high seas i thought it was like one of
6357100	6363500	those do androids dream of electric shrimp or whatever like yeah i was just trying to get primal
6363500	6369420	you know it's like that i was i was like forget it but you know like words that brain she died
6369420	6373820	you know i was like i did note yeah no consciously i was like you know that's the ultimate fuck you
6373820	6379500	is for guys to uh feminize their own brains yeah the the like the way we do ships and
6380460	6387100	everything that we're like oh it's a she because it's the guy like what i was behind that but
6389260	6393660	it's like our ultimate doff of the cap like look at her look at this boat she's a beauty we're like
6393660	6398780	we're like yeah you know you're about to take a test let's see if the old girl still got it yeah
6399500	6403980	because if you made it a dude you'd be in pi let's climb on that big fat cock and go fight some
6403980	6409020	russians but bill bill settle down come on what are you doing look at those balls there's people
6409020	6414620	here come on look at all those guys carrying balls and dicks let's go bill's having a little
6414620	6418460	bit of an episode here when you clean your gun i want you to think of it like it's your
6418460	6424700	your husband okay all right all right let's just uh anyway let's bring the singer out again
6424700	6429020	hey hey everything let's get out here and sing a little bit to bill what the fuck
6429020	6433980	the investors are here but that'd be kind of cool like like you know your own brain you're like oh
6433980	6438540	man my brain she's not running good today yeah it's okay i like i can't i can't tell
6439100	6443020	well it's fun it's polarizing that's what it is oh it's polarizing well you would take better
6443020	6449820	care of it if it were shirts what's your reaction i got a motor level to men uh using the female
6449820	6462380	pronouns to refer to their own brains so so going from battleships to brains and calling
6462380	6466380	on women wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be like a slippery slope anyway it would just be more of
6466380	6473420	the same at least we'd be talking about our brains hey you're talking about it it's very
6473420	6479660	doing all i'm saying it's very the crazy thing is if we started calling women uh he and she or
6479660	6485020	he he and him because because we were like that's it we're taking it you know like we're like like
6485020	6490940	only battleships are women now like like that last parade was out of bounds you guys i don't
6490940	6495820	like how many of you showed up and i don't like what you burnt from now on you're a bunch of
6495820	6502300	hymns that's what you are if i want to talk to a woman i'll talk to this gun what i'm gonna clean
6502300	6506540	her i believe we've pushed through we've finally pushed through
6512060	6514220	like we just revealed shut up shrub
6516940	6517980	yeah shrub
6519980	6524860	all right when does when is when does solo come out and how long does it usually take for a movie
6524860	6529740	and are you and i gonna go see it together i'll go see solo with you for sure are you serious you
6529980	6534700	live stream it and see a movie together i make these exceptions for these some of these star
6534700	6540460	wars movies not the recent one we haven't seen a single star wars movie together since phantom
6540460	6546140	menace i think well no there was the one there was there was the one that came out after phantom
6546140	6550700	menace that was either the second or third of the trilogy and and you said have you seen it yet and
6550700	6556860	i said no and you said are you gonna see it and i said put not in the theater and you said i will
6556860	6561740	pay for your movie ticket if i can go to the theater with you and sit sideways in the seat
6561740	6567660	next to you and watch you watch it and i think we did that did we do that must have been the second
6567660	6573020	one and i kind of just like flying rtd too it wasn't like it was aside from aside from that
6573020	6578620	invitation it wasn't there was nothing cool about it yeah so it's not really a memorable
6578620	6582940	but yeah we watched the phantom menace together we sure did we sure did we were so excited
6583660	6589740	we're so excited it was a rainy rain can we get a confirmation on the solo date though
6589740	6597260	yeah what's going on are we gonna wear solo costumes well yeah man new solo or old so both
6597260	6603180	one of each right okay i want to wear my dan did you get your garage fixed yet yeah awesome
6603180	6610060	but there's no address on my garage you get your what your what garage you get your garage tickets
6610780	6615660	the garage is fixed yeah they haven't quite finished are they playing at the palladium
6615660	6621020	but the people that deliver food keep coming coming this fall to the palladium garage
6621020	6628700	justifiably complaining harmon's garage playing for four nights all right here they come looking
6628700	6634540	lovely look at these new boots the garage are wearing look at that there's the fluorescent light
6634540	6641100	that he's pretty sure is on all the time but it never has the patience to test because you can
6641100	6646540	just always see it still on it's probably it's definitely not on during the daytime somehow so
6646540	6651660	it only knows to come on at night and then stay on all throughout the night so it has consciousness
6652700	6658780	we've confirmed that i think i'm so sorry i asked about that fucking garage
6659260	6665980	it's been the pain of his existence cody's dog pisses in harvey's uh water dish oh on the reg
6667340	6671500	he doesn't mind it though i'm sure he don't he fucking laps it up he loves it
6672140	6678300	harvey loves barbara and barbara's like i can't tell like i mean it's that is the ultimate like
6678300	6686140	even in the dog world that's like like straight disrespectful fucking amazing like she just pisses
6686140	6690300	and cody said i've never seen her do it i was like i was pictured her like peeing on it like
6690300	6699660	marking the bowl uh she said no she fucking like aims it into it wow does cody's dog have her own
6699660	6706140	bowl there uh water no yeah how does she get water oh look shrubs onto something well no they
6708140	6715100	her own pissing bowl well i'm saying like is her own drinking bowl is there one water bowl
6715100	6718940	for the dog yeah that's all it's all the same so she's drinking her own pee
6719820	6724300	yeah she's not yeah i don't know what why yeah why is she pissing in harvey's water
6724300	6729340	that's the only water that's the only water i would say i would say if she had her own bowl
6729340	6734620	that she only drank out of then something malicious is going on but i think what we're finding out is
6734620	6740700	she likes to taste her own pee yeah you know or she's trying to pee in it so she she's telling
6740700	6746860	harvey this is my bowl despite the that's true dogs communicate with their pee yeah that's how
6746860	6755340	they text it's like twitter marking her bowl right oh so they they go okay when okay come on
6758220	6768780	so like like if lolly sees a boy dog that she has a crush on she will pee yeah the dog will smell
6768780	6773660	that and then it'll pee and then lolly will smell that in a piece so they're having a conversation
6773660	6777740	than humans what's that that's no different than humans yeah they're just like saying hey do you
6777740	6789260	like me i think so but do you like me maybe yeah well maybe maybe maybe huh yeah but they took it
