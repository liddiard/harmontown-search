366640	370600	out that's about you Did you have a hand in any of it editorially
370600	392400	You like Harman Town Absolutely two women made it
392400	397280	Two great women made it You had an agreement with them, I'm sure
397280	402240	they're very reverent of you but in order to make a, I got a sneak peek at it, it's
402240	408320	a very powerful emotional portrait They did a great job, it's an American master
408320	416000	so PBS didn't want anybody to see it, I mean it's a rule of the game and they made sure
416000	419400	I saw none of it Alright, and then you finally saw it and how
419400	426000	did you feel You know I saw it with, it opened Sundance,
426000	431640	it opened the festival so that was a great compliment to the film and I saw it with my
431640	438000	family so I was just wondering how's my wife like it, my kids, I have six kids, they were
438000	445160	all there, what are they thinking I have yet to really sit down and see it
445160	449440	Yeah I mean one of the more powerful emotional themes that keeps coming up is about your
449440	460880	dad but let's put a pin in that because the really interesting thing to me is your career
460880	468040	in television before, it's almost a footnote in an equally amazing lifetime, it describes
468040	472920	you, you describe yourself in your book sitting with that crystal radio, do you want to talk
472920	483600	about that for a moment, that first experience you had with, you don't, do you want to sing
483600	492960	about it, do you know about it, a little song, do you know about the crystal radio set he's
492960	499760	talking about, I do not, what the fuck are you talking about, why don't you tell me Mr.
499760	510560	Larry, my dad went to prison when I was nine years old and when I was eight and a half
510560	517280	tending toward nine we made a crystal radio set, it was one of the best times I could remember
517280	528440	having with him and he was gone and I'm fooling with the little crazy, you had the headphones and
528680	534280	what they called a cat's whisker over this little crystal and if you caught a signal you were lucky
534280	539240	and I caught a signal and it was unlucky because the signal I caught had a guy by the name of
539240	549680	Father Coughlin, he was a priest who had a big radio show and he was a madman and a vicious
550040	560280	anti-Semite and anti Roosevelt and he liked the things he heard beginning in Germany, I'm talking
560280	571960	about 1931 so yeah. And you're a kid of nine years old and you're listening to this guy and he hates
571960	581040	Jewish people and it was the first time I knew anything about anti-Semitism which didn't, it
581040	588040	didn't take me long to realize you know if I was hurting as a result of a Father Coughlin, these
588040	595240	people I didn't see a lot of at that time in my high school and my school black people, I started
595240	602360	to see a lot of them a little bit later and I you know I had an automatic affinity for everybody
602360	608760	who was suffering even more than we were. I thought that was an interesting part of your, but I want
608760	621320	to make mention of we had civics classes in those years so we were learning at that tender age about
621320	627320	the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment, all of those guarantees
627320	634560	that this country was going to protect all of us and we would have equal protection under the law.
634560	645160	And that saved my ass emotionally. You mean it protected you from the fear? I don't know. Do you
645160	650600	mean listening to this guy and feeling you might have felt hunted and endangered if it weren't for
650600	660520	civics class? My country said he was evil and wrong and you know we don't have civics classes in
660520	666760	public schools anyway. They cut that like they cut the arts and music and all those things that
666760	674040	bring us together make us feel as one seem to go first. Something we hung on to is the Pledge of
674040	683240	Allegiance which you mentioned in this really stirring patriotic portrait of the America that
683240	688840	you belong to at that time. An America that hadn't entered World War II yet. You talked about
688840	693320	patriotism. You talked about being at parades with your grandfather. You talked about what it felt
693320	697480	like to be proud to be an American back then and one thing that you mentioned that caught my
697480	702760	attention was this was before they had gratuitously added under God to the end of the Pledge of
702760	709960	Allegiance. When did they add that? I could have looked it up but I figured you were coming.
709960	716840	I think it was 1936. I mean recently they added that. I mean there's a huge irony to that. This
716840	723480	idea that this is one of the dragons that you fought your whole career and very capably. It's
723480	730680	this weird this morality concept that some people say has something to do with
731240	738680	Christian values which you would not argue with. I don't get the impression but what you would
738680	744200	argue with is that being shoved down people's throat and unduly influencing elected office
744200	751000	and things like that which is why in the 80s when the moral majority started. That's when I started
751000	758120	People for the American Way to fight the moral majority. Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy
758120	764440	Swaggart, all those guys that were building these giant congregations insisting that
765880	770920	you were a good American or a bad American. I mean you were a good Christian or a bad
770920	776760	Christian depending on your political point of view. I didn't start People for the American Way
778440	784840	at the beginning. I just did a 60-second television spot with a working guy sitting
784840	794040	on a piece of factory equipment and saying that he and his family sit around the dinner table
794040	800920	breakfast table talking politics all the time. His wife and his kids disagree about all kinds
800920	806680	of things and he disagrees but here come these ministers he said on radio and television telling
806680	810520	you you're a good Christian or a bad Christian depending on your political. If you agree with
810520	815640	them you're a good Christian. Well I agreed with them on a lot of political stuff so I was a good
815640	822280	Christian. My wife was a bad one and I gotta tell you my wife I know my wife is a hell of a
822280	827400	much better Christian than I am and he winds up saying so there's got to be something wrong
828040	833400	when anybody tells you you are a good or a bad Christian depending on your political point of
833400	839000	view that's not the American way he said. Also ties into something you were talking
839080	843080	you talked about about comedy when you were in the part where you're talking about Jerry Lewis
843080	848360	which was we could start to talk about the the your early career which gets pretty fascinating
848360	855400	um but when you you stopped while talking about Jerry Lewis and talked about the um the way you
855400	861240	put it was if you're if you're comedically empowered I'm paraphrasing you you you have a
861240	865720	you have a you have a once you once you become so popular for making people laugh that you can do
865720	870520	whatever you want next you can become you can continue to be a clown or you can you can rise
870520	877320	to the papacy and you said and and that that that idea that certainty is the enemy in comedy as well
877320	881400	that not to put words in your mouth but that Jerry Lewis being an example of somebody who
882040	886840	became so certain of himself and his sense of control his need for control that maybe he
886840	894600	started to get a little unfunny. He became a kind of pope figure uh you know he makes his own point
894600	901080	I don't have to talk about that as long if you've ever seen the years of muscular the muscular
901080	908440	dystrophy telethon you can watch him at the beginning being the most hilarious 35 years ago
908440	916440	or however many uh I mean he was the funniest man I ever met and we all but died laughing
916440	927240	Ed Simmons my partner and I uh and uh and then little by little he became uh he knew everything
927960	936040	and uh every year he did that telethon as the master of ceremonies and you can see him change
936040	942520	over the years and become that figure uh you know when they split up everybody thought
942520	946840	Jerry was going to have a huge huge career where what was Dean going to do without him
948040	956200	and uh and Dean did better yeah you know and now I guess you now tell him about the birthday candle
957960	964440	Jerry Lewis as funny a moment as I can ever recall please please just blew my mind please
964440	971400	tells us it was we were doing that I think that's the third or fourth Colgate comedy hour
972200	978680	and the guys were in Chicago so we were they were at the Chez Paré in Chicago and we were
978680	987080	staying at the and I forget the name of the hotel the fanciest hotel in Drake the Drake
987880	993160	did you say dreck the drake no was it was it the drake uh no
996520	1000120	it's just the worst game show I've ever been
1003640	1010760	he it was Joey's birthday and Eddie and I uh we were on the same floor and we
1011880	1015800	went to pick him up we were all going out to dinner we were going to meet Dean in the lobby
1015800	1024040	and uh we knocked on his door again this was his birthday and uh come on
1025880	1034520	and so we opened the door was pitch dark and uh and we tiptoed in in the darkness and suddenly
1034520	1043800	there was a candle lit candle I mean a match lit and the man as the match descended we saw
1044120	1054760	uh him with an erection and a sitting naked with an erection and a baby candle in it
1056760	1061160	wait in it singing singing happy birthday to you happy birthday
1061160	1068760	wait Jerry Lewis
1073640	1077320	and the king of birthdays I have a couple follow-up questions on that
1079080	1081240	how long do you think he'd been waiting there for that
1082840	1085000	do you think it was like five minutes long enough to get an erection
1085800	1089080	I I think he could have heard the knock and run into the neck
1089400	1093880	oh really the candle was in the candle no he'd have to be sitting there a little while with the
1093880	1101560	candle yeah oh there's preparation there now what do you do so how long was the candle in his dick
1103480	1106600	just just so you know just so you guys know November 12th
1108920	1111560	that's when it took place no that's my birthday
1111560	1117080	okay you're invited Norman
1118920	1122680	if the lights are out don't worry about it yeah the lights are out please come inside
1123640	1126280	I always wonder what I hear these old Hollywood
1127560	1132120	I have to go back to say that there were there was never anybody funnier than he was
1132120	1138520	in those years and that was a hilarious prank among thousands of hilarious pranks
1139160	1145640	uh no you you you you literally truly loved him I mean you you say so you praise him to no end
1145640	1153080	we used to he had a little play he was on a malfie drive in uh uh pacific palisades
1153720	1159240	and he had a playhouse next door I mean in in the back the garon playhouse named after his sons
1159240	1168840	Gary and Ronnie and uh and we Eddie and I used to he'd be behind the bar you know getting us a
1168840	1178520	we were not drinkers but you know in in the afternoon and uh we'd say uh you're 86 years old
1179160	1184680	so he'd become 86 years 86 years old with an Italian accent Italian accent and you're blind
1184680	1190680	in one eye you're hearing your aunt call you from another room and there's a baby crown and
1190680	1199000	we just throw things at him and he'd add he he'd do everything you asked him to do one and combine
1199000	1208440	them and uh until we fell apart yeah yeah I only yeah it occurred I mean um I didn't mean to bring
1208440	1212360	him up in a bad light when I brought him up immediately it was I was it was the connection
1212360	1219560	between in politics and in comedy certainty being the enemy um and it was curious um what you when
1219560	1226680	you when you watch uh today's comedy like it's just really like this our country loves its
1226680	1231160	comedy and we're a very successful country and we're and our comedy is very successful and it's
1231160	1237720	institutional and to what extent you know you you very quickly gravitated towards controversy
1237720	1244200	in your comedy you went out of your way um uh you you win it when you could have easily taken
1244200	1249800	the path most traveled you tended to end up on projects that were causing letters and uh
1249800	1253800	to be written that wasn't the you know the intention at all there was no such intention
1254680	1259000	I don't think you were Geraldo Rivera but you know you wanted people to have a discussion
1259000	1263320	what what got that laugh I said I said it's not like you were Geraldo Rivera or something
1263320	1268600	I'm not saying you're like a controversy junkie uh like you like you wanted to make headlines
1268600	1276280	with your shenanigans I know we were uh I learned uh I mentioned my father going either way when
1276280	1281080	my father went away my mother was selling all the furniture she had to get out of the house she
1281080	1289880	couldn't live there in shame anymore and uh uh it was like two nights after he they had taken him
1289880	1295240	away and the house is full of people that were looking at the furniture especially my killed me
1295240	1300920	to see somebody thinking of buying my father's red leather chair from which he controlled the
1300920	1310120	dial of the radio and so forth uh like Archie's all those years later uh but somebody an adult
1311080	1315480	buying this stuff I couldn't bear to start with puts his hand on my shoulder and says well
1316200	1322360	you're the man of the house now so under those circumstances you're looking at a kid in that
1322360	1330040	situation and you're telling him he's the man of the house somehow I got a sense of the foolishness
1330040	1341480	of the human condition that was just in its own stupid ugly way hilarious and uh and I got it and
1341480	1347000	that's what we wrote out of there wasn't any subject that we ever dealt with that wasn't in
1347000	1352440	the neighborhood they weren't talking about down the street across the street you know women went
1352440	1357400	through it women went through men and you know parents and their kids the kids in school
1358360	1363960	all the things we did were just out of what we were reading about or hearing about or living
1363960	1369400	through when you were doing uh all the family like in some of the more like you know some of
1369400	1373400	the topics you dealt with in that were very controversial for the you know compared to what
1373400	1378680	else was going on on the air did you get us like a lot of interference from the network or studio
1378680	1382840	at the time did they did they have any say on the set like during the week of rehearsals
1383560	1391960	yeah no they yeah uh it took me three years to get the show on because uh abc who bought it the
1391960	1399560	first time uh laughed like hell but wouldn't put it on they they there were two pilots for all in
1399560	1405080	the family there were three three there were there were two pilots and then the on the air show
1405800	1412440	the two pilots had gene stapleton and carol o'connor the two leads and different young couple
1413240	1419240	i kept thinking i could improve the young couple and happily it took three years and three do
1419240	1428840	you know three uh makings uh tapings before i got rob riner oh so he wasn't your you you you
1428840	1433080	described you were friends with carol riner and you you've described rob little rob riner
1433080	1439560	being hilarious on the floor because he had been raised around comments my oldest daughter they're
1439560	1446680	both 68 years old and uh my oldest daughter and he were playing together and he was teaching
1446680	1453720	how to play jacks and uh because he had been at eight years old or seven years old hanging around
1453720	1458440	his father and his father's jewish friend comedians he was talking like this
1461640	1464760	that's that's that's that way you do you punch the bow and then you pick them up
1468280	1472920	but she said he wasn't doing impressions of anybody in particular he just adopted a comedian's
1472920	1479320	personality he grew up around since caesar's your the whole cast of but he wasn't just parroting
1479320	1487720	them he was he was he he had affected their language it rubbed it rubbed off um i i wanted
1487720	1492440	to talk well what i was leading you down the road of was just to make get get get the get the uh
1492440	1496360	you know master jedi to make a quick commentary about today's comedy but i'm not going to lead
1496360	1502920	you to that that that whatever who cares but but uh um i guess i was just a little curious about
1502920	1508920	what somebody who for whom politics and comedy were were both like inseparable because what
1510120	1515720	when you look at today when everything seems decidedly non-controversial in terms of comedy
1515720	1521240	when not if you're watching south park well yeah south park is amazing yes do you watch do you
1521240	1528040	watch south park i do watch sound well i watch it when i can there's so very much he officiated
1528040	1534120	troy parker's wedding really i just read amazing that's amazing that's amazing you've sat in their
1534120	1542200	writer's room right fantastic he does bar mitzvahs he does uh i can be at anybody's house tomorrow
1544200	1549480	but but so competitive rates your your your career begins so is it we've touched on your
1549480	1558120	dad so there's this it's it's amazing in your book how you parse it out you you you you even in
1558120	1563560	your book you're you're you're stirred by this and confused by your relationship with your
1563560	1570680	with your father and so we find out who it is yeah yeah who is it i don't know i gotta find
1570680	1576920	out i have six kids and i always tell them please be rob ryan well if rat surling wrote this that's
1577000	1589640	your dad it is briana leer uh oh it's jerry lewis's lawyer i'm sorry it's jerry lewis's lawyer
1591480	1598680	no it is uh it is a daughter at vassar uh who just got something she sought and she couldn't
1598680	1607960	be happier about it oh thank you you said you have you have six kids you said i have six kids i
1607960	1616360	my kids range from 21 to 68 yeah you have a job try that up aside yeah
1619480	1622600	you have a daughter that's 50 years and i did that with small hands
1623560	1632600	so what so when what when for those people those young people planning to have kids is it's it's
1632600	1637080	it's good to have them 50 years apart right because then the the older one doesn't pick on
1637080	1644600	the little one as much it's less bullying they're all may i say they're uh they're all
1645560	1655480	very close um who's the worst one i i'm the worst one so your career starts as like your childhood
1655480	1660760	is sort of like your feelings about your dad are so prominent and and the thing that you later reveal
1660760	1665480	after you've talked about your your exploits for a while and you touch back on it and you
1665480	1672040	and you say in the book there's a word i haven't been using and that word is fraud like i talked
1672120	1678920	about the trouble that my dad got into i've been so your your dad's like sort of inauthenticity
1678920	1686040	was a huge factor in your life that was very confusing to you you loved the guy so then he
1686040	1693080	goes away you like let's let's put a pin in world war ii for a second which you find um
1693080	1697560	i it's impossible to interview you and i'm a terrible interviewer and you are impossible
1698200	1703000	you'd have to take it just any chunk let's talk about civil liberties for six hours but
1703000	1708680	your your your writing career i mean you you initially you wanted to be a publicist you wanted
1708680	1715560	to be one uncle who used to flick me a quarter when he saw me and i just got a picture of him
1715560	1723320	today from his granddaughter someplace in maine where she went for whatever reason she went to
1723320	1729240	her mother's her grandmother just died and she was going through all this stuff and she came
1729240	1735000	across some pictures of this uncle that used to flick me a quarter and he was he flicking
1735000	1741160	you a quarter for what had you done that was so great he just uh liked me and flicked me a corner
1741160	1746120	oh what's up that was my role model and uncle who could flick a quarter i wanted to grow up
1746120	1750280	i wanted to grow up to be a guy could do that oh you i have a niece right now you didn't want more
1750600	1754280	i can't do that you still think a quarter what can we get a quarter here
1755240	1758280	see i i have a niece but i don't think a quarter would work anymore i think
1759480	1764360	well i could edit zinc or something somebody somebody giving this man a quarter i remember
1764360	1771160	sitting on a fire escape with my mother and my father and my sister on a hot summer's night
1771160	1777800	and the conversation for 20 minutes was whether they could afford to give me a dime or a quarter
1777800	1786520	i can't remember what that was to go get a pint of ice cream at the drug store that's how much a
1786520	1792920	dime or a quarter you got ice cream from the drug store yes from the drug store that's the best place
1792920	1798760	before there before there was uh ice cream i used to in high school i would go to thrifties drug
1798760	1804600	store and get and get ice cream when i was a kid okay so so you kind of you don't interrupt my
1804600	1811480	ice cream story your uh your entry into writing is you were talking about the war well i was i
1811480	1814920	don't know i was put a pin in the war because it's we'll be here all night i mean we'll we'll
1814920	1820760	go back to it in a in a in a second but your you come out of the war interested in the world of
1820760	1828840	publicity you end up writing just as if it was as if it was a moving job it you care it you you
1829240	1835960	it was a way to keep from going broke and you but the audacity of you that that this
1835960	1841240	was it danny thomas was what was your first gig that you or was it who was the guy that you called
1841880	1846840	danny thomas did you want to just tell that story really quickly this is because people
1848120	1853080	no take your time i just like people i i'm on panels and people say how do you break into
1853080	1863000	the business listen to this method i read in uh variety or the reporter that danny thomas's
1863000	1871080	agent was william morris office i had an idea for danny thomas uh called his office at 12 30 or so
1872440	1878040	hopefully uh hoping that he would be at lunch got his secretary on the phone he was at lunch
1878680	1885240	and it's talking as fast as i could i said uh i'm norman leer i'm uh i i just spent three days with
1885240	1889800	danny thomas i'm writing a big story for the new york times i'm at the airport i'm going back now
1889800	1893640	i hope they're calling my plane i've got to talk to him i have two questions i'm going to file
1893640	1897960	they're going to write in on the plane and file it when i get to hey she gave me his number
1899640	1905400	so i called his number and he answered the phone he was alone in the house with his
1905400	1913640	accompanist i even remember the guy's name wally pop was his name and uh while he was going to appear
1913640	1920840	at seros a nightclub a very famous nightclub on the strip the very next night at a friars frolic
1920840	1927800	it was a it was a show business event everybody there would know his material he said and he was
1927800	1933640	looking for something in his uh you know that went back a few years that they hadn't heard
1934200	1941240	uh and i said well this this is brand new they haven't heard it and he said it has to be short
1941240	1947640	i said it's very short whatever i have to say he said all right get your ass over here so i said
1947640	1952680	well this is like you know quarter one i said well we'll be there i can be there by four o'clock
1954040	1959800	he's he's mad and he says you say you're calling from hollywood i'm in beverly hills i'm 20 minutes
1959800	1970040	away what do you mean four o'clock but we hadn't written this thing so he said if you're not over
1970040	1976200	here by three or whatever the hell he said we got there he read it he liked it it told very easily
1976920	1982680	and uh and he did it the next night and he killed and we were in the kitchen at seros
1982680	1989560	peeking out through a curtain and saw him just and i got a call the next morning
1990200	1993880	could we be in the ark do we write television i said yes we
1995640	2004760	hey everybody why not it was new norman i'm sorry how old are you at this time i'm uh 29
2005720	2012360	29 or 28 something like that amazing he had already you know yeah fought in world war two
2012360	2018200	yes voluntarily uh was jenny thomas was uh was he already on was it was father
2018200	2023000	the father knows best right was it was that honor or no is that later no it's later yeah later no
2024200	2030920	it's uh the father the father knows best was late he was a nightclub comic he was a nightclub
2030920	2038920	raconteurs like nobody else he told long stories and uh i like his style like lots of
2038920	2045720	them biographical and there was nobody else like danny thomas he could tell a story for eight
2045720	2052600	minutes and get a thousand laps along the way so so we wrote this uh story for him so that that
2052600	2058600	audacity which you you have this remarkable combination of audacity and acquiescence which i
2059480	2066200	have a question about in a second you i swear it's gonna be great um but what wait till you
2066200	2073480	hear this question yeah the um but in in those moments like your career beginning like that
2073480	2078840	just because by sheer force of will and through let's call it dishonesty i mean it's a negative
2078840	2084520	word but like you were lying to danny thomas you lied to him you lied to his agent you lied to him
2084520	2091400	on the phone you you were a con artist in that moment and you and your your your oh no norman
2094280	2100600	well how do you reconcile that with this with this already irreconcilable relationship with
2100600	2106120	the spirit of your dad i was uh i was all about doing good for danny thomas
2107160	2112360	right you did so okay so that i had something for him he couldn't get anywhere else in the world
2112440	2116680	well that was going to be my my unforgettable question that i was about to ask is is this odd
2116680	2123800	this unique blend of audacity plus acquiescence is it my suspicion was that it's actually a surplus
2123800	2129560	of personal security that you know you're so good that you don't mind listening to other people's
2129560	2135560	needs and this is a little piece i've done a few interviews over the years this is the first time
2135560	2141240	anybody called attention to that you're absolutely right to call attention to it but it is the first
2141240	2149640	time i'm thinking about it i lied to the secretaries telling her who i was and i lied to him
2152360	2158120	well i didn't really lie to him but i didn't say yes or no as to whether i had written it
2158680	2166440	but let's call it that lie now i have to make i have to make my peace with that well gosh no
2166440	2172680	it wasn't a crime you did what did you do it did fine and what did you do i i broke
2174680	2178760	oh my god you know i'm saying like drop it a sham layer what did you do dan
2180520	2186040	your stories about your dad make it sound like your dad was just bad at something that you
2186040	2193720	turned out to be very good at like you you know like you you know my my my father was
2193800	2198280	selling fake bonds right he was up he was you use the word fraud later and it's like hard
2198280	2202360	it sticks in your throat to say the word fraud because i'd rather call him a scoundrel right
2203960	2210040	and so that's how well i guess or a rascal that's a good one i love a rascal but it's okay well
2210040	2214360	we don't have to i mean i'm not froid i'm not gonna like wait i i just i just yeah i guess
2214360	2218280	my answer is you hadn't thought about it like like like how that sort of applies when you're
2218280	2223320	going like yeah well i'm at a gas station that's why i'll be i'll be three hours okay
2223320	2229880	i have to write this thing which is like i've done that a lot too uh and i i i guess i wonder
2229880	2236840	like for you was is writing is it a magical thing that people are born to do or is it a
2236840	2242280	means to an end and you could do anything you want because you're a god it's a loaded question
2242280	2247800	no matter which you answer you sound like a prick
2249800	2253960	i sound like a what i said if you answer if you took either of those options you'd
2253960	2259800	sound like a prick i guess i i i created a trap there i just made is writing is writing this did
2259800	2265240	did writing become did you did you you you didn't you didn't you weren't you have to in order to
2265240	2274040	write you have to be a prick thank god well yeah if you have met vince gilligan he ruins it for
2274040	2284120	everybody right oh vince is so nice he's really nice he is super nice guy really nice i hope to
2284120	2290120	work with him i think i think my question is is is writing in the blood or is right or is writing
2290120	2295400	a just another thing you can learn to do like juggling or no i think writing is its own
2298120	2308200	yeah a writer pays attention to life uh i'm not uh with the conscience of uh a forethought but
2309560	2316120	differently from another the average person because i because i've spent a lot of years
2316120	2319960	when i wasn't writing in a lot of years when i wasn't i was paying more attention to everything
2319960	2325880	when i was writing and uh and i'm doing that now we're doing a new show this is brent miller
2325880	2336200	sitting here we're doing a new show together and next room is uh kiyomi and when you call me
2336200	2344840	she says hello yeah well i well i'll give props to uh it's steve leavy who hunted kiyomi down
2344920	2351000	is it kiyomi yes uh yeah i i said on this stage it was a fantasy to have you up here and steve
2351000	2356760	leavy uh went and made it a reality so i could show what a bad interviewer am but uh because
2356760	2362680	it would have been fine as a fantasy as uh but but but here we are and uh um yes this uh well
2362680	2366280	you're doing a thing for netflix that sounds really interesting it's sort of i don't know
2366280	2370680	if you're offended by the word reboot but you're you're you're revisiting uh one day at a time
2370680	2381480	yes uh with rita mereno rita mereno rita mereno oh my god we're doing uh a cuban american version
2381480	2390600	of one day at a time and uh she is the older generation uh justina machado uh who's just
2390600	2396680	great is playing the daughter and i forget the name of the young actress who plays the
2396760	2401080	granddaughter three generations of cuban americans and they're gorgeous and brilliant
2402280	2406600	yeah and plus black people like we're you know we saved them already with tv right
2409720	2413160	but but speaking of what are you doing
2415400	2423000	what are you doing right now oh my god oh my god you i'm so sorry norman leer i'm so sorry
2423800	2429560	okay one of these examples of audacity plus acquiescence
2432680	2437960	one of these examples of audacity plus acquiescence is this uh it's it's it's briefly touched on in
2437960	2445240	the in the documentary i saw uh what is the documentary called jesus christ just and my
2445240	2450520	bumper sticker reads just another version of you that's the title and that's the title just look
2450520	2454680	at his bumper when you want to remember okay i'm looking at it right now just google norman leer
2454680	2463400	you piece of shit bring in the bring in the car bring in the car bring in the car uh in between
2463400	2469960	good times and the jeffersons there's this anecdote the it'd be a good times was it was
2469960	2476040	was it literally like the first uh black family on television in a in a sitcom at least i mean
2476760	2483560	literally in any version yeah and so the and so there's it there you there's it kind of like
2484520	2490440	it you got this you have that amazing feat which is breaking the syndrome of people are watching
2490440	2495800	television and they're being they're they're taking their cues the national psyche is it can
2495800	2500280	change we have a responsibility to change it and so there's this amazing like feat in terms of a
2500280	2505880	writer's accountability to the public uh trust and then at the same time there's a guy on it who's
2505880	2509880	catchphrases dino might and there's conflict therefore on the set this is the documentary
2509880	2516360	touches just on this it can't be an easy set of highway cones to to thread the the then there's
2516360	2524440	this anecdote about of like three black panthers show up it come to your office and say they want
2524440	2529000	to talk to the garbage man i want to talk to norman leer the garbage man and they storm into
2529000	2534200	your office and say good times is bullshit how do you you have this guy they they read you the riot
2534200	2540600	act now pause here and anybody listening put yourself into the situation like how acquiescent
2540600	2547640	are you going to be um uh you in that moment like you know maybe not in that moment like it's forest
2547640	2554280	gump but you you credit that moment as starting us down the road toward the jeffersons so you're
2554280	2558280	still listening you've already proven that you're the king of television at that point and people
2558280	2563880	are barging into your office to call you a garbage man and you listened to them and and took their
2563880	2567400	feedback and made another great show that was great from another perspective what were the
2567400	2572440	panthers what were they mostly because they were living in the projects because they were downtrodden
2572440	2582040	or it sounds they just wanted to talk about why their big uh belly ache was why does the guy have
2582040	2588760	to hold down three jobs since occasionally in an episode it almost seems like he's you know
2588760	2594680	looking for a fourth he he's so hungry to make some money to support his family and why can't
2594680	2601960	there be an affluent uh family on uh black family on television they didn't get as far as why can't
2601960	2610600	there be that but they they were pissed off that the only family that existed uh the guy had to
2610600	2614680	hold down three jobs and you didn't say hey i'm like you didn't get mad you're like you have a
2614680	2618600	point when they came in looking for the garbage man i did take him over to the window and
2618600	2625480	pull the curtain aside and said look down there you see three it's we were on the third floor
2625480	2630920	see down there you see those cans and so what uh the guy the garbage man can't be far from there
2634680	2642360	so they oh okay okay okay it was confusion uh jefferson spun off of all the family where did
2643160	2649640	yeah george was on all the family right they lived next door on the family uh uh
2651000	2658760	lionel was lion was uh his good friend and they moved in the jefferson's moved in next door to
2658760	2670520	the bunkers on maud uh ester roll played the maid on maud and uh she was just dynamite you know
2673240	2680280	and uh it's pronounced and we on maud we introduced her husband john emus
2680920	2684200	and the network said this was showing those two people so because i mean
2685560	2691640	i i was born in 73 so i was like a little kid growing up on some of your shows and then like
2691640	2695640	then there was syndication and stuff that like i got to watch it all from the very beginning
2696200	2701880	but like those this might be 51 years in this man
2703880	2708440	holy shit he looks to me like a friend of my dad's
2711000	2712920	well that's you know we drink more than you do
2715080	2721880	it's been a long weekend uh but like the the beauty of those shows is that it's it's first
2721880	2726200	and foremost the writing i mean obviously what the content of the shows was but also you have
2726200	2731240	these wonderful casts that i don't like you don't see you don't see that a lot like the the the cast
2731240	2736680	of good times jefferson's all the time like the acting that went on also some of the most memorable
2736680	2742120	theme songs in the world like like we all know every word to those for the rest of our lives
2742120	2748840	were you involved in the in how you selected the themes or like i selected i think i certainly
2748920	2753400	wasn't involved in their creation but you said this is the one but i'd like to sing them all for
2753400	2767400	you now um they were i mean you the your uh shows are all characterized by something that i mean
2768200	2773480	they they're like plays i mean you you you tended to we did them we did them in front of a live
2773480	2779480	audience like a play they were written to to play like a play and when we talk about multicam
2779480	2784440	as a format you know we we talk about canned laughter and we talk about the cheesiness and
2784440	2793080	the sanitized uh artifice of it all but then we continue to go to that bat at least i do i i i
2793080	2798120	always say well if i mean it's we haven't been doing what norman leer did why we don't we don't
2798120	2804280	have any right to shit on the multicam format until we go back to doing what you were doing
2804840	2811960	um the the i'm curious do you have any theories thoughts rants screeds about why is it that we
2811960	2817720	saw you nail it and then turned our backs so willingly and what it was working it was working
2817720	2823720	as a business model your shows were hits they were also they didn't have you know they they
2823720	2828040	allowed for 10 second uh gaps of i could listen to the man all night
2830680	2835480	they were they were they were plays and they were character driven and they had stories to them and
2835480	2843000	they they you but you you didn't think so why is it that we went from that to to what we have now
2843000	2848440	there are a lot of shows are paying modern family is paying attention it's that's about a lot of
2848440	2855320	important things it's a it's a wonderful show and as i say uh you know seth mcfarlane and uh
2858680	2865000	and but what about but what about multicam sitcoms though or if you well i i love uh
2866040	2873400	what's his face uh what's the name of the show mccur car michael i i think car michael is
2873400	2876920	through what's i never even haven't even heard of this you whipper snappers come on the show
2876920	2883800	i've come i can only say he's a 27 eight-year-old comedian he he is the centerpiece
2883800	2892440	of a family of a show they do it live and it's terrific uh all right hipster
2894920	2903320	then uh then there is uh blackish but but blackish is a multi-camera made in front of a yes made
2903320	2910840	in front of a live audience uh you know terrific show oh all right well i'll check it out ish
2912440	2917080	and wednesday night we're making the first episode of uh one day at a time
2920600	2927400	so this ability to listen to people who barged into your office and are totally you you would
2927400	2932280	be entitled to not listen to them you'd be entitled to not listen to anybody you you clearly
2932280	2936760	didn't have to come here listen to my bullshit you you're still watching other people's comedy
2936760	2942920	i'm 43 and have already started down the road of total obsolescence because i don't uh what how
2942920	2950920	why are you so nice uh is it yeah what's your problem what are you hiding norman
2951320	2954200	here's a fact
2956360	2966360	it has taken me 93 years a bunch of months a lot of several weeks a lot of days minutes
2967320	2974040	seconds to get to this fucking second it's a it's a tough booking this show it is
2974040	2983720	it is taken everybody who's applauding has taken every bloody second of their lives
2984440	2991000	to get here just to be looking in this direction at me so you you remind yourself if you add that
2991000	3001000	up against my 93 i'm way ahead but seriously the answer to the question is living in the moment
3001640	3005400	and and but that sounds like that's leading automatically to empathy because it sounds
3005400	3010120	like you're talking about you can sense you you you don't have to remind yourself whereas
3010120	3018520	my therapist and has to remind me that they are people like like you you you you're you're
3018520	3023320	by being in the moment you're like you're like you are you are them you are the people that
3023320	3028280	barge into your office and call you a garbage man you are them you are another version of them
3028280	3036440	means that's your uh-huh i figured it out no i i have sat here you know how you can have
3036440	3043800	90 strains of thought and in in your brain at any one moment you can but again again well then four
3047640	3053160	i top out at two i'm like holy shit norman leer's here what am i going to ask next
3054120	3058760	those are the two thoughts i can hold in my head but i've wondered about these
3058760	3064440	faces and these some i can't see back there with the lights but you know everybody has
3067000	3074680	put it this way if you have some sense of the creator's design here the enterprise
3075560	3081640	this being a planet among a billion in the universe of which they say there are also billions
3083880	3090280	then can you get your fingers close enough to measure the importance or the impact of any two
3090280	3099480	individuals from albert einstein to anybody sitting here if you would appreciate that
3100600	3108600	we all matter and uh and how much we matter you can't you can't as i say you can't get your
3108600	3113960	fingers close enough to measure and so it may as well be that and living in the moment and
3113960	3117240	i don't know great i love waking up in the morning
3122280	3126040	i don't i don't have a more favorite thing are you guys applauding the morning or
3126920	3131400	did you get the sense he has a heart out in the hood norman when when like like a famous person
3131400	3137640	like dies that that is touch do you like do you like text like some of your friends and say
3138440	3145080	do i like i love you i i just really appreciate you and you just like like say david bowie dies
3145080	3150040	and you're like oh man that hurts me so much and you want to you want to reach out to your friends
3150040	3155080	and say i really appreciate you i think that's i i really you know you're only going to be here
3155080	3160520	for so long and i appreciate you it's something he does to me every time someone dies it could
3160520	3166120	be a famous person it could be a loved one he texts me that he loves me i take it as a
3166120	3173240	criticism of my lifestyle do you think so i want to know which which one of us is right
3174760	3177480	like yeah i think you're both wrong
3180680	3185480	okay good all right good well i think that's i think that's where we'll give him his freedom

3639880	3642920	well a lot of people you know i don't want to i don't want to i don't want to ruin what could
3642920	3649080	have been a great historical segment for harmontown but toward the end he farted and uh no no i i no
3649080	3654120	i just i got i got i got i was so nervous about being professional and like making it like uh
3654120	3658040	but you did a contain thing and then there was a big applause thing that was kind of like summed
3658040	3662280	up you know it was like oh no what if i go past that which i could constantly do and then i was
3662280	3667560	like all right get out of here get out of here they're applauding yeah i wanted i wanted to talk
3667560	3672920	about world war two a lot i thought that'd be fascinating that's a it's a weird awesome
3672920	3678600	third dimension yeah man charlie in the bush but you know we that was one of his worst sitcoms
3678600	3683000	by the way but we could talk about that stuff without asking him questions that's that's why
3683000	3686040	i'm a bad interviewer because really i just want to talk about stuff you did a good job because you
3686040	3692440	uh you read the book and i tried to just yeah you know but really i could just talk damn read the
3692440	3699400	book he listened to the book he listened to the book he listened to the book yeah
3703080	3707560	the audio version of his book him reading it or somebody else is like no it's him that's awesome
3707560	3713640	that's a feat too that's another feat that's fucking hard reading your book into a microphone

5178120	5185320	here we go let's do it let's do our uh race in porn segment uh it doesn't have doesn't need
5185320	5188120	to have a theme so i got
5190200	5196920	pornography is emerging and so is race all right
5201320	5208600	oh boy uh porn hub uh i don't even know what they were did was that there was a page
5208600	5213080	that uh if spencer was here he could explain it because i think was it you were was it spencer
5213080	5219320	you did it can you do you remember what the context is steve leavy did you want to come
5219320	5231000	explain it steve leavy steve leavy everybody steve leavy hello i it was uh they were putting emojis
5231640	5236760	for their categories right but was it was it specifically like here's emojis you can use no
5236760	5243000	no they they picked them and that's what well yeah but you're this is i'm saying like what
5243000	5246600	what the hell was their point what were they trying to do like create a secret code or
5247240	5252040	so it was like a it was like a cute thing it was like here are emojis for our categories
5252040	5257320	right so another so yes yeah so they were saying like when you want to text your friend about porn
5258120	5263400	like like you can use these emojis to you mean these code phrases is that what it was i thought
5263400	5268120	they were doing it on their website is like a or like on their mobile phone right there so
5269480	5276600	i don't know uh but at any rate whatever it was whatever the context it was like their emoji for
5277320	5285880	latina which is a category of porn uh because fetish uh the the uh it was a taco i'm i'm going
5285880	5291640	like this because i'm indicating the size of the emoji like emojis are like it was a taco uh and
5291640	5297560	you know that's that's that's valid valid outrage lately like it taps into a okay it's
5297560	5302840	a it's a new you know it's like this is so like like yeah like the what's the emoji for white
5302840	5309400	person i'm sure i'm sure it's i'm sure it's nothing rob because it's the it's the it's the
5310520	5317640	so it's the it's the hegemony of of of normativization hegemony of normatization
5318440	5323320	um you don't have to say something all the time i mean this is just like if you don't you can
5327080	5331960	let's just i mean it's like let's say you're gonna get invoiced if there's
5334200	5339640	oh my god if you just you just behave yourself for a second so steve you and dan watch porn
5339640	5344040	together or you text each other about porn what's going on it was like a it was like a top 10
5344040	5350920	article he knows about my passion for and i was like oh dan you know he's a progressive guy and
5350920	5357720	likes for the issue that they're using uh just you know okay well something kids well well i think
5357720	5363160	it i think it pokes into a larger a whole larger issue which i think is a good thing i think it's
5363160	5368280	great that now these conversations are being had about porn because it's furthering the normalization
5368280	5376760	of porn being outraged about minutia of porn like hey like 10 years ago uh a uh an adolescent
5376760	5381320	or a young adult like a latin person in their tumblr blog they wouldn't you know they would
5381320	5386680	they would be maybe afraid to say oh this is an offensive thing because they'd be simultaneously
5387320	5392040	uh copping to awareness of porn in the comments would be like who watch porn much
5392040	5395960	i mean as recently as 10 years ago that might have been the case so is that there's a little
5396040	5402600	silver lining in there all right so it's you text pornhub and emoji and they send you a video
5402600	5408120	so that you don't have to search so it's like so if you text them a taco they'll send you they'll
5408120	5412680	send you a video what are the other races like what is asian what is black what is you know
5412680	5419480	well they're all pretty guess what uh mature like it's like it's scissors for lesbians interracial
5419480	5433640	is a a yin and yang sign that's great yeah uh home run lesbian is a scissor uh cream pie is a
5433640	5443320	cake with cream in the middle so this is like a monastery sort of porn exercise big dick is the
5443320	5451880	eggplant squirting is the little you know come on come on what are the other what are the other
5451880	5459000	ethnicities this is all of them yeah is that the whole that's the yeah you got it what are some of
5459000	5469160	the more specific ones so not that i care it's very dim can you brighten it up yeah you're saving
5469240	5475960	your battery good luck you gotta save that battery there leaving but i have like a million anyways
5475960	5483160	refreshing that uh uh porn which i keep i keep beating that drum you get guess what and other
5483160	5488680	things guess what the cherry if they're two cherries guess what that stands for what that is
5488680	5497640	fruit salad small tips two cherries yeah it's dumb doesn't make any sense well yeah let's all
5497640	5503000	yeah problems with the is it they they they were in thin ice before they stepped out the door
5503560	5507880	we should come out with emojis guess what an old school atari joystick is with a knob and the red
5507880	5521720	button solo male that's that's that's all porn oh in terms of what you're looking at oh okay

5532600	5537400	flags like like country yeah see that's the thing like well and this is something that you know uh
5540520	5547560	not not just japanese isn't sushi oh come on no i'm serious it's not i thought it was
5547560	5552760	steve i guess come on guess what what what what what the right on fist means
5554360	5562200	i have a bit you get one guess uh something's pretty funny i don't know but but but pantomime
5562200	5567640	guess what guess what two crossed cutlasses like pirate swords two crossed cutlets that's gay gay
5567640	5573960	porn yeah oh sword fight sword fight all right okay i can't i was slow on that one that's the
5573960	5581400	classy one i was slow wow um but i just realized but you can flow chart through that now so imagine
5581400	5591880	being in whatever that think tank is if they they're there maybe they did initially go flag like
5591880	5596440	because that's the easy choice and then they're like oh is that gonna no there's no way they went
5596440	5600200	down that road because they're like oh that might offend people if you use the mexican flag what
5600280	5608760	what a columbian thing let's put a taco uh i i just thought for a second like oh there must be
5608760	5615640	i'll bet you a million dollars that that that uh is there a llama everybody over there would agree
5615640	5621800	they made a mistake but but the good but the good news is i just like you know not to beat a dead
5621800	5630520	horse but i just i like that today's young person uh uh in a in a sea of of outrage and complaint and
5630520	5635480	and hashtagging and all that stuff i like porn being added to that it represents to me who has
5635480	5641640	no horse in the other race to me it represents porn being closer to the front door and in our
5641640	5649960	living rooms and being talked about i like it talk about talk about porn talk about it to understand
5649960	5658040	talk about porn talk about it give your neighbor a hand go over at night now no don't give your
5658040	5664040	neighbor a hand until we until we teach people to what the heck it is and what it is and what
5664040	5670760	sexuality is and what you know i mean you gotta be really careful with that stuff dude wait so
5670760	5676440	you should teach people yeah we need to teach people we don't and we shut it and we we block
5676440	5681000	people away we still yeah we push it down and that's where it turns into like a weird black
5681000	5689480	market like thing which where then you're entrusting sex awareness to you know hard working but maybe
5689480	5694360	not you know they're not there's no regulation and there's no yeah exactly that's my point
5694360	5702440	exactly we finally agree about porn no we don't no we don't what do you want porn to be come down
5702440	5709800	what would be what would be your dream future of the state of porn in you know 20 years well i
5709800	5715560	think it should become the equivalent of like cosplay the way we talk about like like the way
5715560	5720280	we compartmentalize our fantasy life from our reality and are comfortable with it so that people
5720280	5725480	don't get hurt like like you know there's people we were having conversations now about like
5725480	5731000	you know uh you know young women that that dress up as poison ivy and go to comic con you know
5731000	5735480	how you know you're not allowed to just they're not saying you're allowed to objectify them just
5735480	5739480	because they're dressed that way etc it's like a conversation starting to happen but it doesn't
5739480	5745080	have anything to do with as it did 20 years ago oh why are you dressed like poison ivy if you don't
5745080	5752120	want blah blah blah to happen so it's like i what i want for porn which is an industry that has been
5752120	5762360	for a long time uh you know like just rife with suicide and um drug abuse and and and you know
5762360	5769880	disease and like just sad stories uh exploitation and things like that like the more you talk to
5769880	5775240	people who you know as a younger generation is coming into it that has a little a few less
5775240	5780920	cathaxies like there you're seeing a little more possibly mental health within the the
5780920	5786200	porn world maybe and but we need i think we need to what i would like to see is for porn to be
5786200	5792040	just on the other side of a curtain where you know you don't you don't need it to be
5792040	5797400	ever present and visible but it's like it's also at the same time it's accountable to
5797400	5807000	uh the same rules that uh uh normal life is it's just on the other side of a curtain
5807000	5811320	which means that this life doesn't have to be such a fucking lie because then you don't have
5811320	5815720	conversations with people where you're like sit you look like like our worship of movies and
5815720	5821160	television and and and stuff like it has like this dark side to it where we think that our real life
5821160	5827720	is like not a thing that's worth living because we're not robert downey jr in a in a robot armor
5827720	5832760	suit like like it's like we need to it would be nice to be able to recognize like that's mythology
5832760	5838440	and that we use that to entertain ourselves during this very important life that is happening
5838440	5842520	right here that's very entertaining even though maybe my podcast is two hours long and has no
5842520	5851880	structure to it i'm i'm advocating for the right to be boring and yes i i have an agenda
5853720	5855720	here's something i didn't know i was into

5913480	5918760	like i think it was at smith is one of the uh one of the east coast colleges uh by and large
5918760	5924920	there's a very large uh like lesbian community there at that school large lesbians or the
5924920	5933960	community is large i think both oh okay uh and somebody's saying is maybe some hair can verify
5933960	5939240	that that the those schools like those sister schools are based on or scooby-doo is based on
5939240	5943640	them or that like that like one school is the shaggy because the people that get high
5943640	5951400	and one is the the thalma because that everybody there is lesbian and uh is that a real thing it
5951400	5956680	is vassary shaggy uh smith is i think uh daphne
5958520	5966760	delma um uh freddy's princeton well that's uh oh yeah that's one of the six yeah yeah they all
5966760	5971720	have but i met these two girls at a bar in that town like south hampton north hampton whatever
5971720	5977800	that is in uh massachusetts and uh there was two girls sitting there and they were dressed exactly
5977880	5983080	like daphne and velma and they were exactly what they were in this thing but like totally
5983080	5986840	non-ironically there was just two girls sitting there anyway long story
5990360	5993480	like i've grown to accept daphne like
5996040	6001320	in my old age isn't she right in your wheelhouse isn't she well see you'd think so but like i
6001320	6005960	didn't like i mean i really did i watched the i watched that show and i really was quite taken
6005960	6013480	with velma and uh you know it was a i really liked her and uh so she kind of distracted
6013480	6018200	it's the maryann maryann from gilligan's island complex it's like ginger was a redhead and she
6018200	6022760	was supposed to push your buttons but it's like when it's when it's so but it's like maryann had
6022760	6029080	dimension so you know you're kind of like well then it's like it's a trick it's a so you know
6029080	6035800	it's like oh you're it's like oh she's she's not the glamorous movie star she's got pigtails
6038360	6043080	and then you're like then you're like you get you get mad at ginger you're like you're like
6043080	6048120	fuck you you're not beautiful i hate you this is a poor girl you're oppressing i wonder what
6048120	6052120	norman lira would think thinks of sherwood sherwood schwarz do you think he's like like he was like
6052120	6057160	fuck that hack or like like i kind of want to ask him about erwin allen too yeah like like like
6057320	6064440	people who were prolific but maybe yeah but i yeah i want to i'm curious like would would
6064440	6070200	would you ever catch norman lira like like just talking shit about hacks and stuff or is he just
6070200	6074760	like so he talked shit about he talked shit about later jerry lewis like he's like he was
6074760	6079640	funny then he fucking lost his shit and he wasn't funny anymore yeah i think he would you know shoot
6079640	6084120	straight on that you know what can i tell a story about that that i learned from from that book
6084120	6095320	yeah uh the uh him and his partner uh uh last name emerson he mentioned him up here i can't
6095320	6103640	remember his name the uh that's great dan uh the uh they were working on the for martin lewis uh
6103640	6110360	and uh they went from their first paycheck was they were splitting 700 bucks uh which was a big
6110360	6115000	deal to them it was a lot of money it was a windfall and then by the time they were done like
6115000	6119560	three seasons of that show they were making like 10 000 an episode or something so you can imagine
6119560	6127720	i mean if 700 was a big deal so so and then they um there was a full page ad that was taken out
6127720	6133080	i think by the producers of the show that just said you know you guys have been the unsung heroes
6133080	6137320	of comedy for a long time we just wanted to acknowledge sort of probably in variety or
6137320	6144280	whatever existed done it uh uh you guys are great and mentioned them by name and said
6144280	6151000	like hey leer and and emerson like you you guys are you guys are great you've been writing great
6151000	6154680	comedy thank you for writing for martin lewis all this time and all this stuff and it was like a
6154680	6161960	month later like jerry lewis like unceremoniously fired fired them and leer points out in the in
6161960	6168440	the book that in all of his million interviews and books and documentaries and things lewis has
6168440	6175480	never acknowledged that anything has ever been written for him so there's a dot connection there
6175480	6180920	where it's like was that what they did they that's something like like society started saying like
6180920	6187160	oh these guys write for you and then they got and then they got fired oh wow but then but jerry
6187160	6191560	lewis's movies the ones that he didn't write where he had writers those are fucking hilarious because
6192280	6197160	one of the greatest physical comedians of all time then when he's writer director producer
6197160	6202360	actor everything they're garbage they're really i mean there'll be a funny scene or two but that's
6202360	6206680	what he's talking about and i was trying to stitch that to like look if i see a talk show a late night
6206680	6211000	talk show and it's like tonight's guest is the vice president of the united states and we're
6211000	6218440	gonna play tug of war gap gap is that comedy i wanted to ask someone who you know spent his
6218440	6224200	career like right i wanted to because i just wanted to hear him go no thank you yeah because
6224200	6231000	it makes me angry i don't like institutional apple on the desk fucking fun is funny i was so
6231000	6235320	intimidated by just his aura and presence and the fact that he's also this really
6235320	6243640	magnanimous nice like i was really laid back you took it in stride i i should say that
6243720	6249160	but that was this whole thing that happened earlier was an amazing moment for me because
6250200	6254040	those you know he was going to be here tonight by the way uh i got tipped to it
6254040	6258040	this afternoon so i came just to be around it but it's just you have to understand that that guy
6259240	6265320	uh owes me 10 bucks sure but he's like sydney he's like sydney lament and he's like haskell
6265320	6271080	wexler and these guys who are politically active and i would say uh in his stead maybe somebody
6271080	6276200	else would have done it but created the sitcom as a political venture the political sitcom which
6276200	6280680	was not just selling soap but it was saying this is what's going on in the world right now all
6280680	6285960	things having the conversation yeah you could list the things that happen there's a ron glass
6285960	6292600	episode that's just about the way we perceive race and it's split in half uh the refrigerator breaks
6292600	6297480	down they don't have any food or something meat heads left in charge and archie happens to be
6297480	6303800	there and then ron glass comes in as the uh the the repairman and there's two different versions
6303800	6309400	so one he has a gigantic afro and a switch blade it is the biggest thing you've ever seen
6310120	6313560	just to eat an apple and archie's talking about how threatening this guy i was and whatever and
6313560	6317960	then meathead tells his version of the story and it's a totally different thing and it's hilarious
6317960	6324040	from minute one all the way through to the end but even as like a kid watching this stuff and i
6324040	6330680	for like that i would just go jesus christ regular regular use of the n-word in both
6330680	6336200	all the family and the jeffersons i know like like like you know like that was it was it was
6336200	6343240	just all constant conversations about the actual thing my my when i've my grandpa was a world war
6343240	6349400	two vet who who lied about his age to so he could be in the war so he's like like you know it's
6349480	6355160	almost you don't even want to call anyone from the greatest generation a a conservative or a
6355160	6358840	liberal because it's like those words have been so polluted because it's like what else could you
6358840	6364440	be if you were if you were a vet like like like i don't have fault my grandfather being by our
6364440	6372360	modern definition a little more uh like like not the most open-minded dude in the world um and he
6372360	6379080	and one of my uncles uh his son his only son was a total hippie like it was a very analogous of the
6379080	6384680	meathead thing and there's going on in every house in every uh every city and they would watch all
6384680	6388840	in the family together i would watch them watch it and i was just a little kid and all i knew is
6388840	6393320	that my grandpa didn't really like my uncle that much but that they both like this show and then
6393320	6398200	one guy would talk and he would say like the n-word and stuff and they go and faggot and queer and
6398200	6402760	and and and and and then but then they would take turns laughing it was like the old guy would talk
6402760	6405880	and then the the old guy in my living room would laugh and then the young guy would talk and then
6405880	6411240	the young guy would laugh um and it was it was like it was the why why did we turn our backs on
6411240	6418360	that i remember the episode when sammy davis jr comes on this is what they said like he it's like
6418360	6423960	i think someone says like yeah he's black oh no carol o'connor goes archie mucker says he's black
6423960	6430280	and jewish oh that's a two-time loser and then and the sammy davis when he leaves before leaving
6430280	6437400	plants a giant kiss on his mouth and it's it got the audience shrieked with like with joy it's
6437400	6442360	really really amazing the big controversial thing was not only that it was like he normally was
6442360	6448760	catching it from both sides when when that show started it wasn't a ratings hit overnight it wasn't
6448760	6455560	it won emmys immediately but it wasn't a ratings hit the the uh and can you imagine liberals were
6455640	6463240	mad because there was a lovable bigot on tv and they kept using that phrase lovable bigot and
6463240	6469160	and like uh there's there's footage in uh carol o'connor who you really like walk away with
6469160	6473720	suit so much respect for because he was so passionate about that role and as norman points
6473720	6480120	out like carol o'connor was he he was fucking out there the word showrunner didn't exist back then
6480120	6484840	it was like it didn't matter that much like this guy was on tv playing this character so it was
6484840	6490120	like liberals were mad that he was a lovable bigot and bigots were mad because it was clearly
6490120	6496360	making fun of them etc it was like you it was you it was easy to look at it as a no-win situation
6496360	6503560	but it also was an all-win situation it's great i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him and for
6503560	6508680	my my parents sticking me in front of the tv we they were really really strict about stuff and
6508680	6512280	about watching tv and when you could watch it and how many hours and stuff but if they heard the tv
6512280	6516360	on and they yelled out the morgue what are you watching and i said i don't know it's a leer thing
6516360	6521480	they would let me watch whatever it was and because they knew that it was complex jet magazine or
6521480	6525480	ebony magazine would come out and richard priorvian or somebody be in it and they would mention
6525480	6530840	writing on one of his sitcoms or shows or something you know whatever paul moonie uh i
6530840	6535560	think he hired him to write for several shows and stuff and these are people we had records of but
6535560	6539480	nobody else talked about it outside of that or knew you know and my parents would get these things
6539480	6546680	and they'd put it in front of me and go see that that guy and he's it's just it's insane at every
6546680	6551080	level of him taking you know just taking situations and putting them out there and the mechanics are
6551080	6556520	sound and and the jokes are tight and you're laughing the whole time but there is so much
6556520	6565560	going on mod uh with b arthur just attacking these ideas of in the height of the of the power
6565560	6571880	women's movement um just everything what that is to be that how you deal with menopause and how you
6572440	6576360	move these things in and out of a storyline and make people laugh but also make them walk away
6576360	6579560	understanding what's going on at the end of it all the studio lights collapse like crazy and it's
6580120	6584120	you know it's yeah but you don't get the sense that there's like juiced laughter no no not at all
6584120	6589800	comfort with silence you can hear people clearing their throat they did a rape episode they did an
6589800	6595880	abortion episode cancer episode like all yeah if it was if it was something and it was and it was
6595880	6600360	back then it wasn't like yeah you go let's do a special episode and win an emmy it was like every
6600360	6604600	step of the way it was always like don't do this don't do this don't do this and he always had to
6604600	6609960	say every step of the way all the family firemen um because it's like the sets were just like like
6609960	6614200	plays they were just like you know like like community theater sets that they were really
6614280	6618280	like samford and son all in the family like they were just these really simple sets
6619800	6626680	uh uh the the writing is so funny on those shows that they work like like satellite radio comedy
6626680	6634840	stations play giant sections of all in the family or or samford and son and it's incredibly like
6634840	6640840	it's vaudeville it's really good writing and i mean we get like it's it's character driven
6640840	6646920	uh plays it's really really crazy the jeffersons was it was same setup as any other sitcom i could
6646920	6653000	turn on tv anywhere else and watch but the people steering stirring the drink were black and for me
6653000	6657560	as a kid it was insane and the buffoon that was a neighbor was the guy bentley or anything like
6657560	6662440	was a white guy and just watching this like this this exists this is happening who is the asshole
6662440	6665800	couple that live next door too that were always being a bummer no no there was a multiracial
6665800	6670760	couple right wasn't there like it was roxy ruckus lenny clark lenny krabitz's mom and um i didn't
6670760	6677800	know that yeah and uh um geez the big the big white guy yeah oh oh tom right yeah she was
6677800	6684040	because she would only like tom and here we go oh everybody and then just these dad jokes that
6684040	6687720	would just fall flat but then you're just laughing because this is like the least funny guy
6687720	6692440	in the room but it's by and by design and by intent i remember people use the adults who
6692440	6696120	to call me in a parties and stuff and like set up kids and like reenact that episode
6697240	6702920	my little brother would walk around go whoa watching out what's your day wait demarj like
6702920	6707960	was there a time like where you did that did those just come on and you you saw the shift
6707960	6712200	or oh shit that now there's black leading characters or was that already on when you were
6712200	6715960	like it was like in new york there were so many there were so many channels that needed programming
6715960	6719720	and so they would just fill up blocks with everything and so you could see everything
6719720	6724440	on any given day and you could essentially binge watch as a kid because you're around in
6724440	6729560	the summers and it's just non-stop bob newhart the old bob newhart show etc etc that's funny
6729560	6733640	you know and so you're just getting blasted with this this brilliant stuff but this is like this
6733640	6737720	i knew i learned immediately and i think someone her parents even said if you see norman leer's
6737720	6743880	name on something you can watch it because it's it's going to be complex it's going to be important
6743880	6749080	and he's doing stuff that's not i mean then again like i say there were these people who existed
6749560	6754120	wexler shot medium cool and like walked right into the chicago riots in 68 i think it was
6754920	6758840	and just shot shot a movie because that's what was happening now that's what was important and he
6758840	6764120	thought art should reflect that these movements have any kind of movement has two or any successful
6764120	6767560	movement has two things there's a rhetoric of agitation which is the thing that's shaking the
6767560	6771480	glass threatening to break it and makes everybody back up and a rhetoric of convergence behind it
6771480	6776200	which is the thing that sort of makes everybody they they people go around it and they just kind
6776200	6780040	of go okay look shut that guy up and we'll advance you a little bit and you have to rattle
6780040	6784840	a box and you have to move it and in his shows specifically i think you get and this might be
6784840	6789800	this thing about acquiescing and stuff you get both of those elements you know the topic for topic
6789800	6795720	for topic it can be aggressive politically and controversy or whatever but then also yeah i don't
6795720	6800760	know if it exists so now the playing field is but another tv person told me when you watch all in
6800760	6807480	the family the secret to keeping that thing going was that uh uh if you actually watch it
6807480	6814360	through a political lens meathead was always wrong politically and so was archy but their
6814360	6819160	meathead was always right about archy and archy was always right about meathead so is that
6819160	6824520	because that was that that's what makes it like you you can just do that for 100 episodes then
6824520	6830680	because it's never preachy certainty being the enemy in politics and comedy and religion
6830680	6835160	and everything certainty is the enemy and even in that show i think as an audience you are often
6835160	6839880	wrong about edith and then they take the latter half of that series to prove to you that there
6839880	6843640	was so much more going on in there and there's a point where she they're arguing and it's the same
6843640	6847400	thing that's been happening every episode and then she stops and she screams at him she goes
6847400	6852360	not this time not now and if you watch any of those episodes you just your heart stops dead
6853320	6857960	all of her secret wisdom that she has that that she can put up with somebody like archy
6857960	6862280	like it's she's not just a dummy she's really really great it sounds like it's aggressive
6862280	6866520	preaching but watch the i mean if you haven't seen any of these episodes or any of these things
6866520	6870440	just watch the shows and you're and there's a great clip you will be entertained as the top
6870440	6875160	priority awesome i forget what the episode is but it's a bit it's so funny and it will last forever
6875160	6881240	like in the annals of comedy it's uh she asked archy do you love me he's like oh jesus christ
6882200	6888520	he did that and she she she nails him down on it and it's really really wonderful because she's
6888520	6895000	she's the uh she's the uh the straight man like she's the she's the protagonist in that thing
6895000	6900600	it's really really great and you know and and there's jean stapleton right yeah oh my god the
6900600	6905240	cast the acting fucking amazing and then later in life you see them do things out of that context
6905320	6911480	and realize these are the most brilliant performers artists in the world yeah because they're all
6911480	6918680	british and shit i mean they may as well be like carol kotter is not he's not like this
6919960	6924760	you know he's like like his his accent is not archy bunker's accent and uh in other words
6924760	6929960	stapleton's like they're intelligent people uh all right so i had a minute go off there
6929960	6934840	that was like a life-changing thing today so thanks for that but yeah sorry dan uh your
