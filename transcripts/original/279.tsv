0	9120	From fantastic uptown Burbank.
9120	12200	Harmon Town is now in session.
12200	13640	I'm Jeff Davis, your common traveler.
13640	17320	Let's pick up the Game Master X Turodonaire.
17320	19960	Spencer Crittenden.
19960	22600	The man with the sack.
22600	25080	What you got in that bag?
25080	27240	What you got in that bag?
27240	28240	Dice.
28240	29240	Dice in bags.
29320	32320	What you got in that bag?
32320	34840	I don't know, man.
34840	36880	If you don't know what's in that bag, no one knows.
36880	39840	The contents of the bag doesn't change, you know?
39840	41720	All right.
41720	43480	How about your mayor of Harmon Town?
43480	44560	Oh, yeah.
44560	46160	Dan Harmon.
46160	48840	Sensual.
48840	49720	Hell, yeah.
49720	51440	Yeah.
51440	53240	Smooth.
53240	54120	Yeah.
54120	54920	Yeah.
54920	55680	Yo.
55680	56680	Smooth.
56680	57520	Dogs around.
57520	58800	Yeah.
58800	60760	Oscar's night.
60760	63360	The showbiz is right.
63360	66760	The limelight is out of sight.
66760	68000	Get out.
68000	70200	Get in.
70200	73840	The big sick didn't win.
73840	76160	Yo, Oscar night.
76160	79600	It's all right.
79600	83800	It's all right tonight, because you got nominated,
83800	86040	so you're a hero to us.
86040	90920	Kumail and Emily, good job.
90920	93320	Get nominated.
93320	95640	And if you're going to lose an Oscar,
95640	99960	lose it to get out.
99960	103560	That way, if you feel bad, you're racist.
106400	108120	Oscar night.
108120	108960	Out of sight.
108960	109720	Limelight.
109720	111360	Red carpet delight.
111360	114840	The paparazzi is in sight.
114840	116440	Take a picture with me.
116440	120320	My name is Jimmy Kimmel, you see.
120320	121160	Did he host?
121160	121680	Yes.
121680	123040	OK, great.
123040	123640	That's good.
123640	125880	I'm sure he did a great job.
125880	128120	Yo, Oscar night.
128120	130640	Smooth rapping.
130640	134880	Florida project wasn't there, except in the form of Willem
134880	135400	Defoe.
135400	136680	Did he win?
136680	137640	I got it.
137640	140200	Who knows?
140200	143920	It's going to be a firefight on Oscar night
143920	147360	with the Willem Defoe, not Willem Defriend.
147360	150960	Yo, Tim, what you think about the shape of water?
150960	152960	Yo, I saw that fish.
152960	155120	I wouldn't let him near my daughter.
155120	157400	He's got a crazy fish dick.
157400	159560	OK.
159560	161240	Well, it's Oscar night.
161240	163320	It's our yearly.
163320	166480	This is when we really bring out the glitz and the glamor.
166480	170000	It's the night where we ask the question, who
170000	171440	has a date with Oscar?
171440	172960	Yeah.
172960	175000	Just so you know, a little behind the scenes,
175000	177920	although we like to let the magic be magical.
177920	182240	But because so many people put so much work into it,
182240	184520	our Oscar episode is always, you know,
184520	190680	we start in February, like early February, rehearsing.
190680	192760	As soon as the nominations are announced,
192760	195920	we start writing our sketches.
195920	199120	So we already know who won.
199120	205880	Well, we wrote three sketches for most of the categories.
205880	207920	But as the results come in, we've
207920	210840	got little comedy sketches that we're going to do.
210840	216240	What did you think about Selma Hayek's wardrobe
216240	216720	malfunction?
216720	218960	Dress.
218960	222000	I thought it went a little too far.
222000	224400	In which direction?
224400	228520	I thought it was a little risqué, but you know what?
228560	231840	You go Selma.
231840	233840	You go Selma.
233840	236520	What did you think of Selma Hayek's attire?
236520	237600	I thought it was tasteful.
237600	238840	Oh, OK.
238840	239360	Was it?
239360	239840	Yes.
239840	240320	OK.
240320	243840	Well, bad guess on my part, then.
243840	246480	But who is it was Maya Rudolph at church?
246480	250360	Who is the girl, the chick that was with Maya Rudolph?
250360	252040	Tiffany Haddish.
252040	252960	Fucking hilarious.
252960	255320	They should host all the Oscars from now on.
255320	257200	They were fucking hilarious.
258600	260120	Yeah, they came out with their heels off,
260120	262040	and they held them like, fuck this shit.
262040	266880	And Maya Rudolph was wearing like a snuggie,
266880	268880	like a giant red snuggie.
268880	270360	And she looked great.
270360	271280	I'm not talking shit.
271280	272520	She looked fantastic.
272520	275680	But she did not play ball like in the Oscar fashion.
275680	277160	She did her own shit.
277160	280400	And they were way funnier than everybody else.
280400	282160	And no offense to Jimmy Kimmel, who's
282160	284320	doing a good job as far as, because we only
284320	289360	watched probably what, the third of it, church, a fourth?
289360	290480	He was doing a good job.
290480	296000	But Maya Rudolph and Haddish?
296000	296960	That's what he said.
296960	297960	How do you say her name?
297960	298800	Tiffany Haddish.
298800	300120	Tiffany Haddish.
300120	302000	Fucking hilarious.
302000	303240	Well, I'll have to check it out.
303240	306640	I was a little disappointed, I got to be honest with you,
306640	312080	that what's her name from church?
312080	314000	I'm blanking.
314080	317640	You have to give more of a clue.
317640	318960	The mom from Lady Bird.
323160	325200	Why can't I remember her name ever?
325200	327240	Lori Metcalf, who's one of my favorites.
327240	329360	Her name is always like a fucking blank for me.
329360	330960	Lori Metcalf, that was so good.
330960	332960	And she did not win Best Supporting Actress,
332960	334840	although I thought she might have.
334840	336280	So the results are still coming in.
336280	337160	I take it.
337160	337840	Oh, yeah.
337840	340080	The best picture hasn't been announced, but get out.
340080	340920	What do you think, Dan?
340920	341960	Predict it right now.
342040	344800	Make your call, because that'll be the last thing.
344800	347600	It'll probably happen an hour from now.
347600	349560	My gut says get out.
349560	351800	But I don't really know how the Oscar voting works.
351800	360520	I know that it's like it's a lot of actors of a lot of ages.
360520	362160	It's all about yardage.
362160	364200	Sometimes you make the prediction based on, well,
364200	370920	it's a liberal political easy darling, like it's Hollywood.
370920	376040	But then, look, let's face it, something like get out,
376040	380840	you could find the line within liberal Hollywood elite.
380840	386000	The baby boomers that probably dominate the Academy
386000	390720	might have watched get out and been like, I don't like that.
390720	392880	I would have thought that Shape of Water was going to win.
392880	395760	But Church, were we saying that there's a beef about?
401800	404760	Wait, come on stage, Church.
404760	406600	Like if you're going to talk, grab a mic.
410120	412920	He asked you a question, and then halfway through your answer,
412920	415440	he was like, come on stage if you're going to talk.
415440	417760	Well, if you're not going to ignore me.
417760	421560	She had to turn off the live stream to be on the show.
421560	423960	That live stream, that's money out of our pocket anyway.
423960	425040	Yeah.
425040	428640	What's up with that live stream, Church?
429280	433680	You're telling people to not subscribe to our shit.
433680	436600	I'm teasing the live stream subscription.
436600	439520	It's Church with the Oscar data.
439520	442080	What's up with Shape of Water?
442080	443080	What's the beef there?
443080	446720	So what I was reading a couple days ago
446720	451760	was that they're being sued for plagiarism.
451760	453400	There's a lawsuit that got brought up
453400	458360	by the inheritors of the rights to a play,
458360	465960	like the kids of this guy, this playwright, about them lifting.
465960	469320	It seems like most of the story from this play.
469320	472080	So it's a fish man.
472080	478200	There's a girl who works as a maid in the lab
478200	480840	where they're keeping this fish man in the play.
480840	483960	There's even a scene where the cat's head gets
483960	487280	lopped off in this play.
487280	489600	And those are just the examples that were given in this article
489600	490600	about it.
490600	493600	And their accusation was, well, isn't this lawsuit timely
493600	496080	right when the Oscars are happening?
496080	501000	And their response back was, that's ludicrous.
501000	502800	We have a case.
502800	506800	And it's coming up because your film came out.
506800	508520	Oh, the insinuation was that there
508520	510120	was some kind of weird swift vote.
510120	512200	They were trying to time it to get the money
512200	515840	or whatever by trying to hold the film hostage.
515840	517400	It might jeopardize whether or not
517400	523320	it could win things like Best Screenplay, for example.
523320	525240	It doesn't have that Oscar flavor to me,
525240	527120	Shape of Water, anyway.
527120	527880	You know?
527880	528560	Right.
528560	530160	What does for you?
530160	532560	Well, get out, I guess.
532560	534920	Yeah, but I mean, I know it's very simple.
534920	537000	I want that to win.
537080	539080	Well, honestly, Florida Project, it
539080	541800	didn't get nominated for anything except Defoe.
541800	544680	And then what else was there?
544680	545400	It's just like it's-
545400	547160	The post.
547160	549640	The post is, we know my feelings about that.
549640	553320	And Three Billboards, eh, eh, eh.
553320	554120	Bloodbound.
554120	556200	So I didn't see Lady Bird.
556200	558160	I didn't see, and I don't know what the nominees for Best
558160	558680	Picture are.
558680	560280	But I didn't-
560280	561520	I love Lady Bird.
561520	562840	I love Lady Bird.
562840	565440	The only thing I saw that seems like a shoo-in is get out.
565440	567640	But shoo-in is like with giant air quotes.
567640	570960	Because it's not- we're not talking about a popularity
570960	571480	contest.
571480	574080	We're also not talking about like a craftsmanship
574080	574800	like, uh, fries.
574800	578360	It's important that our friends Emily and Camille
578360	580400	did not win for a screenplay.
580400	585480	But it's awesome that Jordan Peele won for get out.
585480	586640	That's amazing.
586640	588100	Yeah, I mean, obviously, yeah, it's
588100	590800	more of a tragedy for us because Camille and Emily
590800	592640	are family, so we'd rather they win.
592640	594680	But yeah, if you're-
594760	597760	at least they didn't lose to something that we also hated.
597760	598280	Oh, yeah.
598280	604840	And like, Camille just tweeted, they came in second place.
604840	608200	I mean, I have to- honestly, it's like,
608200	610320	it is an honor to be nominated.
610320	611400	It is enough.
611400	613240	I mean, I'm sure it's a bummer to not win.
613240	615000	Yeah, it's not just something that people say.
615000	617840	You get to wear that title for the rest of your life.
617840	620960	Your Oscar nominated so-and-so forever or-
620960	621760	Actually, I just realized-
621760	625240	You won an Emmy for writing about the Oscars.
625240	628520	Yeah, and Monster House was nominated for an Oscar,
628520	631000	and that wasn't an honor.
631000	633520	So maybe Camille and Emily are really bummed out tonight.
633520	634640	Hell, yeah.
634640	636400	But I don't think- it's a different thing
636400	638400	because it's not- I always forget Monster House
638400	640320	was nominated for Oscar because really, it's like,
640320	645720	you make an animated film over a certain budget.
645720	649600	Like, it didn't feel like Monster House was a citizen cane of-
649600	653280	Also, there was like a page one rewrite on that, like, wasn't there?
653280	655200	Like, didn't they-
655200	656360	Monster House?
656360	658200	Did Monster House get rewritten by somebody?
658200	660400	Like, hand it off to another writer or no?
660400	663320	Oh, well, yeah, it wasn't like-
663320	665440	but it wasn't nominated for Best Screenplay anyway.
665440	668400	It was nominated for, like, Best Animated Feature or something.
668400	671880	I think either Emily or Camille tweeted,
671880	675680	like, I would happily lose an Oscar to Jordan Peele
675680	677640	for the rest of my life.
677640	680720	And I think that he means that- or she means that-
680720	686120	Yeah, it's a good year to get nominated in that category and not win
686120	688680	because you can save the rest of your life.
688680	691000	The competition was incredibly stiff.
691000	694120	The Best Original Screenplay category, I've always said,
694120	702120	is curiously seems immune from any kind of, like, corruption or value drift
702120	704600	that you could accuse the Oscars of ever having.
704600	709800	Like, I've always felt like the original screenplay nominees and winners
709800	714520	are pretty, like, I've never- I don't remember ever going,
714520	720160	what? You know, like, it seems like people have a head on their shoulders about it
720160	723360	or maybe it's just, like, an easy thing to go,
723360	725600	ah, that movie was very written. I don't know.
725600	730320	I like that Dunkirk one, like, the moment we stopped watching it,
730320	737440	they'd already run three Oscars for sound design, sound editing, and editing.
737440	738680	Mm-hmm.
738680	740840	And like, oh yeah, like, that's like-
740840	744440	Star Wars and Baby Driver didn't win those things.
744440	747720	Normally, like, it's like a Transformers that wins sound design
747720	750560	that makes a bunch of noise or some horrible shit.
750560	756520	Like, I like that they left it to, like, a movie that just told one very simple story.
756520	760120	I'm only going to say it one more time now that the Oscars are over.
760120	763680	If you're a director and there's more than three kids in your movie
763680	766640	that are on screen for more than a half hour,
766640	770440	you should automatically be nominated as a director.
770440	773640	That's why I feel The Florida Project was snubbed.
773640	779080	And then you count Willem Dafoe in there, who is a very talented actor.
779080	782720	But as we've seen from his oeuvre,
782720	788960	he doesn't come to set ready to ground it.
788960	791720	You know, like Nicolas Cage,
791720	798040	he's perfectly capable in the right hands of being a Stradivarius,
798040	803840	but he will just show up as GarageBand if left unchecked.
803840	809040	And here's my fear, because, like, with somebody like on the crew here,
809040	812120	like, keep us posted who wins best actor,
812120	818440	because I don't want it to be Gary Oldman for his impression of Churchill.
818520	820480	I don't want that to happen.
820480	823000	Put a pin in that. We'll get back to that.
823000	827160	What was Itanya up for?
827160	830000	Did the director of Itanya get nominated?
830000	831080	I don't know.
831080	836080	But that was the winner of Best Supporting Actress was the mom in Itanya.
836080	836920	And she was great.
836920	838440	She's fantastic.
838440	842560	But yeah, I mean, those are the two directors to me,
842560	846120	Florida Project person and Itanya person.
846120	848160	Can't remember either of their names.
848800	853720	But if I was a betting person,
853720	861680	like, betting on length and contribution of careers to come,
861680	864240	like, I would put a lot of money on those two.
864240	871040	I think those movies were outstanding demonstrations of specifically direction.
871040	876080	I think that directors get ripped off a lot of the Oscars because it's hard to...
876120	882920	I think that I'm going to probably get a bunch of tomatoes thrown at me by a lot of like,
882920	888320	I don't know, this is a provocative thing to say, but I think actors control the academy
888320	895280	and actors don't, you know, to them, directors are like these assholes that tell you what to do.
895280	899360	But to be fair, when the director fails, no one will ever know that.
899360	902720	They'll just see shitty performances out of the actors, too.
902720	907840	So they kind of take the fall when, as much as getting all the kind of glory and attention
907840	912640	and having all the focus put on the acting, this is definitely like an actor's event.
912640	918680	I just feel like, not to be pedantic about it, but if you ask a writer who's a good director,
918680	923160	the writer is going to have an answer that has something to do with like, you know,
923160	925680	how they affected that person's script.
925680	929080	And also that writer is going to, they're going to be far from the trenches
929080	932200	and able to observe it kind of rationally.
932640	936640	If you ask other directors, directors are going to go, of course, well, my God,
936640	941320	I couldn't have gotten that performance out of that cat or, you know, that was beautiful,
941320	945600	that shot, and this was, I know what goes into directing, blah, blah, blah.
945600	952200	But if you ask an actor, I feel like they're so close to it that I feel like,
952200	959160	I hate to offend my actor friends, but I feel like an actor in general as like a biomass,
959160	962200	like an actor would go, oh, who's the best director?
962200	967840	Oh, yeah, that one person that they did very few takes and they let me go home on time.
967840	975400	Yeah, but I think my understanding of how like at least the nominations process works is
975400	980280	that it's like the previous winners from your category.
980280	983960	So it's like the other directors who've won best director or it's like the other.
983960	985480	Oh, it doesn't really work that way.
985480	989400	Yeah, so their job is to like watch all the things that are nominated,
989400	993920	like they want to consider for that category and then they decide who's nominated.
993920	997360	So like my friend, it was my friend Michael Dana who explained this to me because he was like,
997360	1005400	oh, I got to watch all these movies and decide who to nominate for best score, best original score
1005400	1012320	because now that he had won for Life of Pi, he was now on that panel to make those decisions.
1012320	1015920	So your job is to listen to everything and decide, okay, these are worthy of nomination.
1015920	1016520	These are not.
1016520	1018520	So then you narrow it down and then everybody votes.
1018520	1021640	Oh, but then is my understanding of how it goes.
1021640	1024760	I think so, yeah, because then everybody throws their hat in and goes, okay.
1024760	1029000	So from the nominations from the people who are the peers in those groups,
1029000	1030760	now everybody gets to weigh in.
1030760	1038560	I kind of wish, I wish didn't carry through the jury of peers in your craft all the way
1038560	1042120	to the finish line because that way you wouldn't have this.
1042640	1048200	Potential value drift, I mean, it would be only to the extent that the definition of good directing ever changed.
1048200	1050280	You know, then that would change.
1050280	1053920	Like I really, it really seems like that would be.
1053920	1056400	And then imagine the honor that that would be, too.
1056400	1059400	You'd be like, holy shit, like Scorsese.
1059400	1064480	But maybe that's why it's such an honor to be nominated, though, because the nomination is the thing
1064480	1071000	that you're actually getting from other people who you've looked up to for so many years and aspired to be like, not the win.
1071000	1075280	And if you get an Oscar, it could just be Marisa Tomei got drunk and she's like, no, I'm just kidding.
1075280	1078880	I love her just like so scared Marisa Tomei is watching.
1078880	1086520	I say we go around the room right now and see who can do the best, bad Churchill because he just wants to do his Churchill.
1086520	1089160	Let's start with Jeff.
1089160	1090560	All right, I'll start. Go ahead.
1090560	1092320	No, we are. Dan, you want to start?
1092320	1095360	No, we're starting with Jeff.
1095360	1098160	We shall never do anger.
1098160	1100320	That's me doing Gary Oldman's Churchill.
1100320	1102920	Okay, Dan, you're up.
1102920	1105840	I mean, I don't.
1105840	1113080	There's I'm coming out in a state of nature.
1113080	1117040	That's good, Spencer.
1117040	1119880	You're a bitch.
1119880	1121800	He was like a womanizer, right?
1121800	1125440	Or like a woman beater, something like that.
1125440	1130200	That wasn't in the movie, but yeah, I'm going to have to look that up.
1130200	1132840	Your name is partially Churchill.
1132840	1134440	So why don't you bring it home?
1134440	1136520	Yeah, you should be the best of this.
1136520	1140400	We shall fight them on the beaches.
1140400	1141480	Hell yeah.
1141480	1150960	Hello, and we will not say that the Greeks fight like heroes, but that the heroes fight like Greeks.
1150960	1152280	That's a direct quote.
1152280	1153200	Jeff, what is it?
1153200	1154080	So was mine.
1154080	1155200	What is your beef?
1155200	1156840	I understand the movie wasn't.
1156840	1159200	We shall never do anger.
1159200	1163080	Do you really think that was that Gary Oldman's doing a bad job in that role?
1163080	1166440	I just think you look.
1166440	1167880	I'm not a big Gary Oldman fan.
1167880	1169680	I think he's one of our bias.
1169680	1171360	He's a great over actor.
1171360	1173520	I just thought that movie here's the deal.
1173520	1174520	The movie sucked.
1174520	1175520	Didn't go anywhere.
1175520	1179640	It was a movie about making one speech and they ramp it up and he makes one speech and
1179640	1181120	then the movie's over.
1181120	1182120	Kind of interesting.
1182120	1183120	I agree with you.
1183120	1188080	Not a not a not an exciting movie and I'm not saying this is a mitigating factor, but
1188080	1189080	it is interesting.
1189080	1191360	When I watched it, I'm like, wow.
1191360	1194320	So this is the guy that's famous for all those quotes.
1194320	1200080	Like if you swing a cat at a quote, like it's a Churchill quote and and the movie's just
1200080	1202360	about how that's all he ever did.
1202360	1204640	He just ran his mouth.
1204640	1209200	But he changed history, running his mouth, but it doesn't make for it a particularly
1209200	1210200	interesting biopic.
1210200	1214480	The end of the movie, I was surprised at the end of the movie when I go, what just happened?
1214480	1219560	And the guy goes, he mobilized the English language and took it into battle, which is
1219560	1220960	a great line.
1220960	1228120	But that's act one like page one like it's like now he was a loud mouth because he was
1228120	1233280	half American and his mother was an American and they kind of got this sort of that kind
1233280	1239360	of like bold outspoken like that's probably a movie that so many people were did not like
1239360	1240360	Churchill.
1240360	1244320	He ended up being a huge hero, especially to Americans.
1244320	1246840	I need to be corny Aaron Sorkin guy.
1246840	1253160	But I think if if I if I had a gun turned on me and like you got to write the Churchill
1253160	1258280	biopic, I having found out through research what that movie reveals, which is that there's
1258280	1261120	not a huge arc for this guy, et cetera.
1261120	1264600	And he didn't do a lot, but but was very important.
1264600	1271440	Just was I would I would then go my my Sorkin gland would then go, OK, well, let's talk
1271440	1276360	about his wife and let's you know that relationship, because I thought that, you know, those scenes
1276360	1280880	were touching and you could tell those were based on either internal notes or studio notes
1280880	1283520	that were like this thing needs something.
1283520	1288360	And so they had this one or two scenes with the wife where you're getting to know Churchill,
1288360	1296160	the the aging lover, Churchill, the the the baby that needs his diaper changed, but acknowledges
1296160	1304320	his his his wife is his mommy and Churchill's wife, the dutiful, you know, the woman has
1304320	1310960	no name, kind of like a selfless politician's wife kind of thing.
1310960	1315880	I would dig like Sorkin deep for anything there and just figure out a three act structure,
1315880	1322720	like have them have a fight on page 70 and then have them kiss her on page 95 because
1322720	1329360	that World War two story turns out it's pretty linear.
1329360	1331200	Those Nazis just kept coming.
1331200	1338160	And then, you know, who was a great Churchill was with go his his Churchill, I thought, was
1338160	1341400	really why don't you do John Lithgow?
1341400	1345800	Do your John Lithgow as Winston Churchill?
1345800	1352160	The only thing we have to fear is that it's about being in a circle.
1352160	1356760	The only one is the fear one of the stick one.
1356760	1357760	Those are Roosevelt.
1357760	1358760	I think that was FDR.
1358760	1365160	FDR is fear, Roosevelt's stick, everything else is Churchill.
1365160	1375400	It is it's in it is in these times of circular mouths that one man's Harry must come to his
1375400	1379360	Henderson's.
1379360	1382360	Where did Churchill say that?
1382360	1387720	I believe in this realm.
1387720	1389480	I believe in this island.
1389480	1390880	I thought you were giving me music.
1390880	1391880	I was trying to.
1391880	1396320	I was trying to give you the Jurassic Park theme.
1396320	1398920	Jeff's iPad isn't working tonight.
1398920	1408320	When I look out at those lighthouses and spotted dicks that make up the coastline of this
1408320	1421040	historically impenetrable isle, I ask myself, what will the man be who gives it up?
1421040	1425440	The answer is a pariah.
1425440	1428200	He will be forever unforgiven.
1428200	1434560	And so I say to you, the House of Lords and the commoners and the third Parliament of
1434560	1446000	Groundlings, we must come together in the opposition for the great crème de la crème,
1446000	1453520	the pièce de résistance, the cockney wainscoting.
1453520	1457080	This country has never surrendered.
1457080	1459640	We were at Stonehenge.
1459640	1462240	We were at Baskerville.
1462240	1464960	We kept the hounds at bay.
1464960	1470560	Jack the Ripper, recoiled from our touch.
1470560	1481200	Pudding was invented here where the place Ben Franklin loved to come on the weekends.
1481200	1486480	That may have been France, but we're 90 miles from there.
1486480	1489600	I'm John Lefkow.
1489600	1496960	Say to you, fee, fine, foe, fum.
1496960	1500560	What's in the blood of an Englishman?
1500560	1511760	Bravery, victory, big sticks, and no fear.
1511760	1512760	Dinosaurs!
1512760	1518400	What did he do?
1518400	1524640	He weaponized the English language.
1524640	1532360	So your version of Winston Churchill thought he was John Lefkow?
1532360	1535920	He became, he found out who he was.
1535920	1536920	Yeah.
1536920	1537920	He's true to himself.
1537920	1542360	That's what Gary Oldman brought to the performance, I think.
1542360	1546360	Shit, what was I going to say?
1546360	1550440	Nazis, Nazis were...
1550440	1555720	It's funny how the most devastating scene in that movie is the phone call when he calls
1555720	1563720	Roosevelt and he's like, can I have some airplanes and tanks?
1563720	1569080	It's like any phone call from any decade within any relationship.
1569080	1573880	It's just heartbreaking, like someone just blowing someone off, but it's like...
1573880	1582840	Winston, I would give you anything, but I have to go take a poop now, I'll be back.
1582840	1583840	Yeah.
1583840	1584840	I must have been...
1584840	1588360	How come the British don't hate us a little bit more?
1588360	1592120	Because they lost their empire like we're about to.
1592120	1593600	They lost their swag.
1593600	1596840	Yeah, but I mean, isn't that when you get angrier?
1596840	1602040	But they didn't have the army or the armada to back that up, but they can be as angry
1602040	1603040	as they like.
1603040	1609920	No, but I'm saying, how come everybody just goes along with the story of us being swell
1609920	1612920	and dandy in our handling of World War II?
1612920	1615760	Because we did end up saving everybody's asses.
1615760	1620840	When we finally did step in, it saved the day.
1620840	1625840	Isn't that something that an asshole does in a situation where they can observe that
1625840	1631360	it's like, well, if I just wait a little longer, I'll be a real hero here.
1631360	1632360	That's what we did.
1632360	1633960	We waited too long twice.
1633960	1636800	We could have saved them early in both World Wars.
1636800	1638680	We were like Gandalf with the eagles.
1638680	1639680	Oh, shit.
1639680	1641280	It's like, well, what the fuck?
1641280	1644840	Yeah, you had these eagles the whole goddamn time?
1644840	1650120	Because Roosevelt was trying to dig the country out of a depression and the country didn't
1650120	1653160	want another foreign war after World War I.
1653160	1654680	And it was a really unpopular idea.
1654680	1658800	So he was holding off, holding off, holding off, holding off doing this.
1658800	1659800	And I guess they do.
1659800	1663840	And I guess I wish I had a historian or somebody up here, so I don't risk offending anybody.
1663840	1674560	But I recall that it's something that we, like we didn't, the revelation of how much
1674560	1677400	Holocausting was happening was kind of like at the end.
1677400	1679600	No, they figured that out when we got there.
1679600	1681000	There were rumors, right?
1681000	1682000	Because people had fled.
1682000	1688120	So when you leave out that, like kind of like very epic, like genocide thing, which is how
1688120	1690040	we're all taught about World War II.
1690040	1695400	But when you just look at it minus that, well, it's just a giant war over in Europe and they've
1695400	1696800	already done one of those.
1696800	1700480	And so, OK, we're here on the other side of the Atlantic, which was a way bigger deal
1700480	1701760	before the Internet.
1701760	1706320	And so, yeah, OK, I guess they just thought like they'll work it out.
1706320	1713240	Maybe Hitler will be a great European chancellor and we'll we'll sell him steel and.
1713240	1716920	People loved him at first, you know, he he he did it.
1716920	1717920	He did it.
1717920	1722100	They were doing a great job of repairing Germany in the first few years.
1722100	1726280	It's when they started conquering everything and everyone around them.
1726280	1730720	That Europe went, uh, maybe we need to call for backup.
1730720	1735160	Oh, Hitler, oh, Hitler.
1735160	1742000	We hardly knew you.
1742000	1746440	I think our problem is we never really got to know Hitler.
1746440	1747440	We were.
1747440	1749800	We didn't give him a chance.
1749800	1757040	I was surprised if I watched a conspiracy thing on Netflix and I was I was kind of surprised
1757040	1766800	at how how likely it is that Hitler faked his death.
1766800	1773520	Hitler was it was just there was never I mean, if you if you go with the straight narrative
1773520	1778360	with no conspiracy theories at all like the actual mainstream like this is what's supposed
1778360	1783880	to have happened, he shot himself from the head and Eva Brown took cyanide.
1783880	1789440	And then the Germans doused his body with gasoline and set it on fire in a shallow
1789440	1793800	pit and then covered that up with dirt and didn't tell anybody where it was.
1793800	1797840	Mussolini had just been strung up in the streets and he'd heard about it and didn't want his
1797840	1798840	body to be mutilated.
1798840	1803520	His body guard took him out and said, like, not only should he be dead and not be able
1803520	1808480	to like be tortured, he should be like mutilated and like like just burned to a cinder.
1808480	1814640	They shouldn't have the body to be able to hang up on, you know, they took him out in
1814640	1817400	the parking lot, burned him up and buried him in a shallow pit.
1817400	1820160	Now, oil sport to the very end.
1820160	1827680	Now, now, let me let me let me run this by you, my little my little historians in a world
1827680	1835040	where we're in Hitler's shoes there in the bunker, like, OK, so he's he's that worried
1835040	1840040	about his corpse being defiled, that he's going to say to somebody, hey, Todd, come
1840040	1841040	here.
1841040	1848600	I'm going to, uh, after I do, you'll hear a pop.
1848600	1852480	My wife will have white foam coming out of her mouth.
1852480	1853480	Don't try to resuscitate her.
1853480	1854480	You might die.
1854480	1856400	He shot her and then himself.
1856400	1857400	Do me a favor.
1857400	1859800	Uh, she took cyanide though.
1859800	1860800	Yeah.
1860800	1863560	Like, don't derail.
1863560	1865920	Do me a favor.
1865920	1867880	I got I'm planning ahead here.
1867880	1874680	I'm at the point where I'm going to blow my brains out, but I'm thinking this much ahead,
1874680	1876600	like about what's going to happen to my body.
1876600	1884240	So I submit to you if he's thinking that much ahead, you know, it's only a little bit further
1884240	1888120	ahead to go, hey, Todd, who's that guy?
1888120	1889920	What was his name at the Christmas party?
1889920	1890920	Everybody's joking.
1890920	1894120	The electrical tape on his lip and he's like, he looks just like me.
1894120	1895120	Yeah.
1895120	1896120	Oh, Gary.
1896120	1897120	Yeah.
1897120	1898120	An accounting.
1898120	1899120	Yeah.
1899120	1900120	Do me a favor.
1900120	1909120	Uh, put a mustache on him and bring him down here and, uh, and Cynthia from, uh, from, uh,
1909120	1910120	HR.
1910120	1916280	Um, and, uh, you know, bring him down and, uh, dress him like us.
1916280	1921800	And, uh, this is the conspiracy theory is that they did a little switcheroo and, uh,
1921800	1925160	and Hitler went out the back door, which he very well, but it's not like he was trapped
1925160	1926160	in his bunker.
1926160	1927160	It was totally possible.
1927160	1932880	I mean, it, it, it, it, it seems like a thing that a spoiled sport would do before he was
1932880	1935960	like, I won't let you string my corpse up.
1935960	1941560	Well, especially for the Nazis who built secret tunnels everywhere and always had all kinds
1941560	1946260	of exit plans and made like alliances in Spain so that they could go through different countries
1946260	1954560	and, and, and there were loads of Nazis who did escape to like Argentina and all these
1954560	1959660	guys, Eichmann, like they, they, they all made it out like, yeah, if I'm at war with
1959660	1964640	your country and during the handful of years where we were at war, I'm finding out that
1964640	1972780	you were, uh, uh, diverting revenue to such causes as trying to sew a German shepherd's
1972780	1978420	head onto a human body or finding out if the devil's real and maybe we could summon
1978420	1979420	him.
1979420	1982460	And here's, here's what I'm not willing to do.
1982460	1988460	Take anyone's word for it that like, uh, oh yeah, our boss is over there in the pit.
1988460	1991780	He looks like a skeleton with a mustache on it, but it's totally him.
1991780	1997260	I'd be like, okay, Nazi, if you see a skeleton with a mustache that was apparently burned,
1997260	1999820	like how, what was his mustache made out of?
1999820	2006100	And here's the thing, like, I guess, uh, the leaders of the time, uh, uh, you know,
2006100	2011500	they were all, all of the world leaders were like, yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
2011500	2015260	Like it was kind of like an open thing that people are like, oh yeah, Hitler's dead.
2015260	2016260	Yeah, right.
2016260	2017260	Yeah.
2017260	2021340	But he was Hitler sightings even all over the United States.
2021340	2026500	Like once people realized what happened and that they didn't really have a body, you start
2026500	2028540	hearing all over the world.
2028540	2033220	They saw Hitler in the mall, they saw Hitler over by the pool, they saw him everywhere.
2033220	2034220	But they did.
2034220	2039620	They did find like a dental, the jawbone that they set the Russians, the Russians are the
2039620	2043220	ones that finally verified it, but they took so long.
2043220	2046420	It's almost like that's another, it just becomes more suspicious.
2046420	2051340	I'm not usually a conspiracy theory guy because I think conspiracy theories are cheating because
2051340	2056380	you, you just raise questions and, and now more than ever, we all, I feel like there's
2056380	2059740	no such thing as conspiracy theories.
2059740	2063980	It's a conspiracy.
2063980	2069980	Speaking of conspiracy theories, Alex Jones is, has he, has he been deleted from YouTube?
2069980	2074700	I hear that's a conspiracy and they're using it as a way to earn money.
2074700	2080440	Be like YouTube's taken us down and only you can give us money to stop it.
2080440	2082020	And then YouTube's like, we don't care.
2082020	2084740	We fucking love Nazis.
2084740	2090220	So did he, did anything, did they take, did they delete him from YouTube or?
2090220	2096260	Not as far as I understand, what's his name?
2096260	2102100	Paul Joseph Watson, that he's a real piece of shit.
2102100	2106340	But he apparently admitted, he was like, no, it's a fucking, we're just using it to get
2106340	2107340	a lot of money.
2107340	2109860	It's our, our YouTube's fine.
2109860	2114020	But it's, that's, I think illegal to do, to say to.
2114020	2115020	Only the nadir.
2115020	2116020	Yeah.
2116020	2117020	Wow.
2117020	2121700	The nadir of our civilization has to be at this point just because now we've, we've just
2121700	2129420	hit the bottom with these, the way we're treating these high school kids that are bothering
2129420	2136340	after I mean, 20 years, they weren't alive when Columbine happened.
2136340	2138940	And then this happens in their school.
2138940	2142580	I don't give a fuck what these kids think is the appropriate response.
2142580	2144980	I'm certainly behind them.
2144980	2147340	Like no one's done anything for them.
2147340	2154820	It's like, it's, we're treating them like chickens in a fucking factory farm.
2154820	2160240	Like we're like, we're like putting them on a treadmill headed towards statistical likelihood
2160240	2171260	of mass death and, and, and the gall of anybody to say to a 16 to 17 year old kid who's, who's
2171260	2175940	going to go, you know what, hail Mary.
2175940	2185180	Maybe if instead of going home and shivering under my bed and weeping, I say some shit
2185180	2191420	and politicize this, maybe, maybe something will change.
2191420	2194380	I like, how do you, how do you, how do you fuck with that kid?
2194380	2200460	Like, like, what, like, even if you are evil, like, just like what the fuck, like it's,
2200460	2201460	it's crazy.
2201460	2208380	We've, we've hit so far below rock bottom at that point where people are just like questioning
2208380	2213140	these kids and making fun of them and like scrutinizing them.
2213140	2217700	And not just the conspiracy theorists, but really the, the more vile of the characters
2217700	2223580	are the, are the people that are like politically combating them and like going toe to toe with
2223580	2225580	them with witty repartee.
2225580	2228260	It's like, this is a child.
2228260	2232260	I like, what the fuck are we doing?
2232260	2240900	And to beat the horse bloody, I, I, we, we, we ceremoniously, ritualistically stripped
2240900	2246340	Katie Rich, SNL writer, who was off duty and made the joke, Barron Trump's going to be
2246340	2248460	the first homeschool shooter.
2248460	2253700	It's not even a joke that has to do with, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a joke.
2253700	2261140	It was a joke about how that poor kid has the worst family ever and, and is never going
2261140	2262780	to have a normal life.
2262780	2269700	And, and in this orgy of we won and we're taking over the world, like Katie Rich was
2269700	2275580	taken to a stake and she was tied to it and she was set on fire and she was burnt slowly.
2275580	2280500	And as far as I know, she's still laying low and enduring death threats and, and whatever.
2280500	2282700	I don't know if she's recovered or whatever it.
2282700	2284460	I know she never got her job back at SNL.
2284460	2289140	I know that they never even did her the honor of telling her she was officially fired.
2289140	2292780	They just suspended her and then told her she wasn't coming back.
2292780	2299740	Like, like we all took part in that because kids are off limits because when it comes
2299740	2304100	to joking around, we got one rule.
2304100	2309500	But when it comes to blowing people's bodies across the floor, we got no rules.
2309500	2313300	It's fucking, it doesn't even mean anything to say the words.
2313300	2314300	It's insane anymore.
2314300	2315800	We've been saying it's insane.
2315800	2317500	The word insane means nothing.
2317500	2321380	Did you hear that there is that kid seventh grade who is going to shoot up his school,
2321380	2324540	but he went into the bathroom and killed himself into the instead?
2324540	2330860	Yeah, it's getting to the point where we have to ask the mass shooters to like solve their
2330860	2331860	own end of the problem.
2331860	2332860	I'm sorry.
2332860	2333860	I'm sorry.
2333860	2334860	I'm laughing.
2334860	2336820	Literally no one else can do anything.
2336820	2341140	So if you're going to shoot up a school, why don't you kill yourself?
2341140	2345380	Like that's, that's where we're at in society is like the, the, the people who are willing
2345380	2350060	to commit mass murders are like, no, this is, this is actually crazy that I'm allowed
2350060	2351060	to do this.
2351060	2353060	That society has let this happen.
2353060	2357880	And we sit up here and we tell these kids, like, you know, if you're having thoughts
2357880	2362960	that you've never had before, your, your body is surging with hormones, you have God knows
2362960	2364320	what's going on.
2364320	2367480	Like, like, please just talk about it.
2367480	2369120	Like don't hurt yourself.
2369120	2370120	Don't hurt other people.
2370120	2371320	Just talk to someone about it.
2371320	2372480	Talk to someone you can trust.
2372480	2373480	Here's your hotlines.
2373480	2378040	Like, you know, we, we try to handle these kids with care.
2378040	2381880	When kids do something wrong, we try them in a different court.
2381880	2386460	We, we, the idea is that before a certain age, your, your, your neurology is forming
2386460	2390400	and we were supposed to be protecting you.
2390400	2392640	It's insane that this is up for debate.
2392640	2400400	Now it's, it's insane that, that grown ass adults are, are having like fucking weird
2400400	2410200	flame wars with recent survivors of massacres who are not old enough to vote yet.
2410200	2414840	And who are just saying, maybe if I say so, I just can't, I mean, I know that we all feel
2414840	2425080	this way, but what, what, like how much further do we need to go before the moral majority,
2425080	2434040	an unfortunate borrowing of a different group's title, but the, the silent fucking normals,
2434040	2439000	the relatively sane of us, how, how, how much further are we going to get before we go,
2439000	2440800	the rules are done now.
2440800	2443880	They don't have rules.
2443880	2447680	Maybe it's like the third of the population that's just never votes because they don't
2447680	2448680	believe in the system.
2448680	2458480	And they're just watching the whole thing burn down and it's like, I, yeah, I, I, I,
2458480	2466320	I stand where you stand, uh, uh, nonvoter, a disenfranchised person, person who doesn't
2466320	2472160	think that anything, but like, okay, but you, you gotta agree with me now.
2472160	2478240	There is a difference between watching a system that is fucked up and rolling your
2478240	2481760	eyes at it and watching children be abused.
2481760	2485160	Like there's got to be a difference.
2485160	2490040	There's got to be a point where, and, and, and I guess what it's like, not only, not
2490040	2495720	only do we have to stop playing by the fucking rules that we made up and they've never followed,
2495720	2498440	but we've got to stop bitching at each other.
2498440	2502200	We've got to stop minding our fucking language with each other.
2502200	2507440	Um, we got to put that shit on hold there, not to mention the fact that there was a study
2507440	2513080	just released that like, not shocking to me at all, that, uh, the, the average African
2513080	2520560	American family in 50 years has made absolutely no progress in terms of, of anything that
2520560	2521560	actually matters.
2521560	2525920	Median income is protected to be $0.
2525920	2532720	It's like, like, like that's fucking predictable and it's, it's fucking, that should be a huge
2532720	2534240	wake up call for us.
2534240	2538920	We started trying to fix these problems by minding our language in the nineties and we
2538920	2541800	had that wave and then it subsided and all these things.
2541800	2546080	People are laughing all the way to the bank when we ignore the, the, the fundamentals
2546080	2549360	of behavior and class systems and things.
2549360	2555520	And we got, we, we are, we have fallen for the oldest trick in the book when we, when
2555520	2561800	we are standing at a, at a, at a protest with each other and someone uses the wrong pronoun
2561800	2566720	and we get in a fight with them instead of fucking facing off with the fucking people
2566720	2571600	with baby skulls on their helmets who are laughing at us because they have lost their
2571600	2573840	souls to apathy.
2573840	2579360	They have lost their souls to, to choices they made so long ago that if they unmake
2579360	2585080	them now, they'd be twice as humiliated as if they just went to hell and died in the,
2585080	2586080	not in that order.
2586080	2592480	They, they, they, they, it's like, we've got to, I, God bless you and your fucking microaggressions
2592480	2593480	watch dogging.
2593480	2600480	I, I, I, it's not that anyone wants your humanity to be divested, but can't you see that we
2600480	2609120	are divided and the bad guys aren't like, can't you, can't you prioritize?
2609120	2615720	Can't you say, first of all, Nazis are bad.
2615720	2618520	Second of all, killing children is bad.
2618520	2622040	Third of all, this fourth of all, this fifth of all, this sixth of all this.
2622040	2629840	And by the way, don't call me that it bums me out now that we're fucking friends because
2629840	2632800	we have to be, or we're going to die.
2632800	2637520	Or put it this way, if you're cynical, because I don't want you to have to make a choice.
2637520	2644080	Let's put it this way, since we're going to die, let's die friends.
2644080	2645900	Let's die cool.
2645900	2649320	Let's die arm in arm.
2649320	2657280	Some of your fellow liberals are stupid, a good 85% of them, some of your friends that
2657280	2662080	you're going to rely on as this ship goes down are, are going to, are going to put their
2662080	2663360	foot in their mouth.
2663360	2665240	They didn't grow up the same way you did.
2665240	2669360	They don't know all their P's and Q's, they're going to put their elbows on the table.
2669360	2676080	Like you have got to draw thick, heavy lines somewhere in your own brain that separates
2676080	2683360	that doofus who's a fixer upper for a later date or a side project along the way.
2684080	2691040	Like from the fucking thugs, the barbarians, the murderers, they have targeted us.
2691040	2693680	They are trying to kill us.
2693680	2696300	They want us dead.
2696300	2702240	They have looked at the numbers and they have decided that democracy doesn't work for them.
2702240	2707960	Because democracy doesn't work for the people that have more money than everyone.
2707960	2711520	They want us to die.
2711520	2720240	Because if we keep being more than them and alive, they lose the popularity contest.
2720240	2723520	They want lead in your water.
2723520	2726800	They want guns in your schools.
2726800	2733360	They want you arguing about whether or not your jacket is racist with the person in the
2733360	2739160	same income bracket as you whose kids are in the same school as yours who are just
2739160	2745720	as much at risk of the next mass shooting.
2745720	2754960	Why can't we hierarchically just go, well, I'm in the American League, then I'm on the
2754960	2757960	Brewers.
2757960	2763560	And I don't like the fucking this other baseball team because I got to play them for the pennant
2763560	2768160	or whatever the fuck I don't like isn't there isn't there a fucking natural thing that the
2768160	2775080	human brain can do or you're like, well, there's these giant teams good versus evil.
2775080	2776280	What is evil?
2776280	2778240	People who did not have your best interest at heart.
2778240	2780000	People who don't believe in the species.
2780000	2783580	People who think that we are in the way.
2783580	2787340	People who want pain and suffering to occur.
2787340	2799080	If it's a choice between that and them getting something like a microwave oven like bad people.
2799080	2802020	You know what evil is.
2802020	2808260	You've seen it like it happens in the gaps between our choices.
2808260	2811980	It's not a there's these humans are monsters.
2811980	2812980	It's a force.
2812980	2815100	It's that cloud that overtakes you.
2815100	2822340	If you leave a vacuum where your soul is supposed to be, it enters you and you do its bidding.
2822340	2827780	There are some people that have been overtaken by this and their families have been overtaken
2827780	2828780	by it.
2828780	2832160	And maybe they'll be casualties in a war between good and evil.
2832160	2841420	But if you're good, like you got to even hope that they're redeemable, let alone the fucking
2841420	2845340	other good guy in the cockpit next to you, the Millennium Falcon.
2845340	2852220	Get your shit together, America.
2852220	2853220	I just don't.
2853220	2855420	I just when we got we got to this right.
2855420	2857420	This is the road flare, right?
2857420	2858420	They're kids.
2858420	2860420	It's a repeat for anyone my age.
2860420	2861420	You know what this is.
2861420	2864300	It's a repeat of Columbine.
2864300	2865700	We are all ashamed.
2865700	2867060	This blood is on our hands.
2867060	2869020	We saw this happen.
2869020	2876980	It's as if God picked the body count so we could wake up and go, oh, this is identical.
2876980	2879580	Everything else has changed.
2879580	2888180	I know blackbusters closed because videotape doesn't work anymore as an industry.
2888180	2894720	But you could kill the same number of kids with the same device just as easily.
2894720	2900400	And there's just as little legislation in the way that the good guys should be the ones
2900400	2905440	the most ashamed about this because we haven't fucking done anything.
2905440	2911480	We haven't laid down on railroad tracks yet.
2911480	2918440	And when you are a family or a survivor or a kid, you come on the TV and say something,
2918440	2923560	there's a platform of people that go, your actors, you're being paid.
2923560	2924840	It's just like Sandy Hook.
2924840	2928760	There was all the crisis actor accusations around Sandy Hook.
2928760	2929760	Those people are insane.
2929760	2931560	They're like the lowest of the orcs.
2931560	2936000	And then there's like these like urakai or whatever that are above them that are like,
2936000	2940640	no, no, no, I'm not saying it's a conspiracy, but I'm just saying like these kids sure are
2940640	2941640	happy.
2941640	2942640	Yeah.
2942640	2943640	They're enjoying the spotlight.
2943640	2944640	They're not.
2944640	2945640	They're not really.
2945640	2949640	It's like, what the fuck are you doing?
2949640	2953400	The children in your country.
2953400	2956160	They were not safe.
2956160	2960680	You want to talk about the world laughing at us?
2960680	2966240	What the fuck country can you go to where children are this unsafe?
2966240	2969120	It's crazy.
2969120	2974160	And I mean, let's not forget, not just these guys are actors and aren't they looking happy,
2974160	2976400	but hey, you should be killed.
2976400	2977600	You should fucking die.
2977600	2979960	I hope your whole family dies.
2979960	2980960	You should die.
2980960	2981960	Go to hell.
2981960	2982960	I will kill you.
2982960	2987080	Yeah, which is a bit a bit farther than just this guy.
2987080	2990200	I saw him in California.
2990200	2991200	You know?
2991200	2992200	Oh yeah.
2992200	2993200	All that crap.
2993200	2994200	So the kids are getting death threats.
2994200	2995200	Oh yeah.
2995200	2996200	Oh yeah.
2996200	2997200	Their families, everyone.
2997200	2998200	It's great.
2998200	2999200	Oh yeah.
2999200	3000200	My favorite though was the guy.
3000200	3008880	I don't know who the fuck this guy was, but he, his reaction was to say, look at how disrespectful
3008880	3011320	these children are talking to Marco Rubio.
3011320	3016400	Look at how disrespectful they're being to the adults.
3016400	3018920	I don't think that it's one person making this argument either.
3018920	3021840	It's a lot of people raising that question.
3021840	3027480	And then some guy did a poll about it, which was like, okay, well, how many people want
3027480	3030840	their kids talking to adults like this?
3030840	3036400	And it backfired because everybody was like, oh, if my kids talked like this, I'd buy them
3036400	3037400	a car.
3037400	3038400	Yeah.
3038400	3044040	It turns out attacking massacre of his victims doesn't play well online and now it doesn't
3044040	3045840	and massacre or not.
3045840	3050260	Who the fuck cares who talks to a Senator like the piece of shit that every single one
3050260	3052680	of them are by virtue of the vocation they chose.
3052680	3054540	This is a fucking America.
3054540	3058620	If you choose the occupation of politician, you're human garbage.
3058620	3061920	Get used to it and don't fucking expect to be worshiped.
3061920	3064120	You're a fucking piece of shit.
3064120	3065120	Believe me.
3065120	3066120	The job comes with perks.
3066120	3070200	Fucking shit and get back to work representing me.
3070200	3072640	People aren't royalty.
3072640	3073800	It's fucking ridiculous.
3073800	3077720	When did we, it's insane.
3077720	3084440	I swear to God, what we should do now that like what 40% of our country just thinks that
3084440	3089400	the president is a king in the office, not even just the guy that's in there now, but
3089400	3093120	we just, we just, we just tend to look at this as like a popularity contest and then
3093120	3094720	you're a prom king of the country.
3095160	3100640	We should now, if we're going to save our country, we should do this full circle thing
3100640	3108640	where we emulate England, make the office of president a symbolic title for a person
3108640	3113460	that can go around the earth waving their hand in a weird way, saying funny things at
3113460	3119760	meetings and making big blustery speeches about what we stand for while a fucking person
3119760	3126120	that went to law school or a group of people that knows how to run anything can actually
3126120	3130240	keep the country from, from, from going bankrupt.
3130240	3132600	Like we just need, we need a prime minister.
3132600	3136640	We can call it a secretary of leadership.
3136640	3141360	Someone who will never surrender.
3141360	3145960	I'm sorry to everyone listening who is only feeling the same thing and has said it a thousand
3145960	3148320	times and it's not like I'm doing anything different.
3148320	3152720	I, it was either this or I was just going to, you saw a sleepy, I was at the top of
3152720	3153720	the show.
3153720	3157080	I'm sitting, I'm sitting on a fucking chair.
3157080	3162640	I'm sitting on a lot of anxiety and sadness and the chair, there's only one thing to talk
3162640	3165760	about and it, and it makes one sad.
3165760	3173080	So okay, let's talk about the Oscars and I'm just like, I just, I just don't have the energy
3173080	3174080	for it.
3174080	3181560	I don't, I want to go back in a time machine to the, to the point where I don't know when
3181560	3185440	it was 2003, 2001, I don't know.
3185440	3193080	When I, when I started thinking of maybe I could care about this species, like instead
3193080	3201280	of just shunning the whole thing and I just, I just want to undo that mistake, but I can't,
3201320	3209720	I have formed a relationship with your obnoxious, moronic, half ape species that does the dumbest
3209720	3216120	shit and it just like, I just like, I, I, I'm, I'm, all of my money is tied into yours.
3216120	3224000	I, my, my survival, like I didn't dig a hole in 2002 and like make a bat cave like I should
3224000	3229280	of, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't focus all of my energy on being completely independent
3229280	3233000	of you idiots.
3233000	3238000	But because I didn't, I can't, can't you just, can't you get your, can't you fucking figure
3238000	3239000	it out?
3239000	3247200	Can't you like touch a monolith and like evolve, like, like, or somebody, somebody do something.
3247200	3252240	It's 300 million of us and we're just making such an ass of ourselves.
3252240	3258280	Our kids, these are kids, they're kids.
3258280	3264080	Like we're, we're eating our own children, we're devouring them, we're like feeding them
3264080	3267440	into this blender.
3267440	3271480	It's like, we don't, it was bad enough 20 years ago when it was like, oh, we started
3271480	3276040	like, like worshiping the sexuality of 14 year olds, but more than we cared about the
3276040	3283800	wisdom of a, of a 40 year old, like we, we, we, capitalism is gonna capital, like, but
3283800	3288560	it's now, now we, now we're just, now we're just eating flesh.
3288560	3292840	We're just like worshiping a golden calf and just fucking eating, eating flesh and fucking
3292840	3294960	the bite holes.
3294960	3302160	And it doesn't, it's like, like we have, we are, we are, we are like, guys, don't make
3302160	3309400	me, don't make me hide, don't make me dig a hole and hide.
3309400	3312360	I'm five years from retirement, get your shit together.
3312360	3319360	I actually, I, I mean, as much as I go through like every thought that you're having on a
3319360	3326000	daily basis right now, I was feeling a lot more hopeless before these kids did start
3326000	3327000	speaking up.
3327000	3328000	Of course.
3328000	3333000	They're really inspiring right now and they've given me a hope for the future that I didn't
3333000	3339320	have because I was really worried about the, the next generation coming into adulthood
3339320	3342680	and voting because it's right around the corner for them.
3342680	3347540	And if the rest of the teenagers over America are cutting through the bullshit as easily
3347540	3351760	as these kids, then we might actually be okay.
3351760	3353960	I'm not so convinced.
3354000	3360400	I just think, you know, they're excited now, but it's not about being excited now.
3360400	3366220	It's about being willing to do very boring, tedious, time consuming stuff for the course
3366220	3369960	of several months, three years from now, you know?
3369960	3373080	And that's, that's just a really hard thing.
3373080	3375040	So that's, yeah, once we see that.
3375040	3382400	The cynic in me thinks that while all this awesome progressive revolutionary activist
3382400	3387880	movement is happening among like high school kids, there's a bunch of other kids who are
3387880	3393840	going to perfect the art of being fascists and, and perfect the art of running for office
3393840	3400400	and being more subversive and, and like Donald Trump is a low level fascist.
3400400	3408920	He's a, he's a, he's a clumsy, like shitty sideshow version of, of a Mussolini.
3408920	3415120	Some young girl or boy in, in school go, oh, if I want to be president and be a horrible
3415120	3420320	corrupt piece of shit, all I have to do is pretend to tell the truth.
3420320	3424800	And like the more awful shit is to come by far.
3424800	3432080	There's no way that Trump is the end of the road on, oh, we had a, we made a boo boo America.
3432080	3434080	We had a bad president.
3434080	3438040	We're going to, the next one's going to be so much worse and we're going to have to outgrow
3438040	3443080	the idea that the office of presidency means anything at all.
3443080	3448360	It's a stupid clerical office that shouldn't be a celebrity gig.
3448360	3453160	The idea that we need leaders is the idea that we're, we've decided that we're going
3453160	3462360	to be ancient Rome or the Republic must die so we can start worshiping dictators.
3462360	3467720	The world is turning towards autocracy all over the world.
3467720	3471440	The next generation of autocrats and oligarchs are going to be ours.
3471440	3476880	They're going to be our children born in the fucking crucible of these fucking high school
3476880	3478460	shootings and shit.
3478460	3486000	We've just proven to ourselves that democracy is awkward and untenable.
3486000	3490280	And the simpler thing is to let, let dictators rule.
3490280	3494680	Which is why goodness can't be shackled by politeness.
3494680	3499240	It can't be shackled by anything because the only chance that we have, and I don't
3499240	3502880	want to talk about it in terms of chances because the funny thing that happens is when
3502880	3508840	you, you know, we all, we also don't want to lose that we want to protect ourselves.
3508840	3513480	And that's how a third of us end up siding with apathy and entropy.
3513480	3518640	And again, I just want to say to those people, how about this?
3518640	3521160	How about we're going to lose?
3521160	3524400	How about we've already lost now?
3524400	3528920	The call to action to you is how do you want to go out?
3528920	3531720	Do you want to kill a bunch of kids?
3531720	3536960	Do you want to roll around in a pile of money that doesn't matter because it's all ending
3536960	3544720	or do you want to find your style, find your voice, emerge from your defensive self-protective
3544720	3551560	shell of apathy so that you can be right about everything because yeah, everything always
3551560	3552560	falls apart.
3552560	3557600	You, if you stand back and say that I just, I was that person too.
3557600	3559120	I still am that person.
3559120	3567160	I'm saying like now that it feels like it's really getting close to the end, like for
3567160	3572200	shits and giggles, let's try some shit.
3572200	3579840	I don't know what that means, but, but I think these kids like the next generation is what
3579840	3584920	church is saying is that thank God we actually see that you could shoot up a school and
3584920	3590120	the kids that survive could actually turn out to have presence of mind, concern for
3590120	3596280	their fellow man, apparently forgiveness of the system that led them to the slaughter
3596280	3600440	enough that they would rather to try to reach out to it.
3600440	3602600	They didn't all turn into little Hitlers.
3602600	3604960	They didn't all turn into little beavises and butt heads.
3604960	3606680	They didn't turn into little Sid Vicious's.
3606680	3612360	They didn't turn into little Rick Sanchez's a handful of them at least turned into little
3612360	3619840	activists, activists, and, and, and, and we need 20 of them for every one of these people
3619840	3623640	that Jeff's talking about because of course they're going to, everybody that grows up
3623640	3629840	in this new world is going to like the, the, the, the, the, yeah, the, the high IQ fascists
3629840	3634960	are coming and they're going to, I hope to see on, you know, March 24th, the March for
3634960	3642840	our lives, um, that there are more teenagers on board with this movement than are not.
3642840	3644600	And I think that that's what we're going to see.
3644600	3650680	I think that it's going to be, I hope that it's going to be huge, but already, you know,
3650680	3654640	I mean, kids are being told they can't go in protest, like you're going to get in trouble
3654640	3657520	if you go in protest, cause you're going to skip school or whatever.
3657520	3659480	And kids are saying, fuck you.
3659480	3665840	And so people are trying to keep these kids who want to join in the fight from doing it
3665840	3668920	by saying, follow the rules.
3668920	3674000	And they're not following the constitutional, yeah, decided on a Supreme court case.
3674000	3678360	If you're, if you're one of these kids and you can hear me like you just, yeah, you can't,
3678360	3679520	you can't listen to any of us.
3679520	3680520	You can't.
3680520	3681520	It's right.
3681520	3682520	That's the thing.
3682520	3684520	Cause even us telling you this is us manipulating you.
3684520	3688160	And that's the one thing you shouldn't do is get co-opted by anybody because that's,
3688160	3689160	that will happen.
3689160	3694160	If you're successfully co-opted by Alec Baldwin, then you become a successfully dismissible
3694160	3695160	as a pawn.
3695160	3698800	Like if somebody, if somebody starts funding you, somebody starts, if there's an adult
3698800	3704000	at one of your meetings where you're planning a March or something, uh, then the enemy gets
3704000	3707800	to rightfully say, well, these aren't real kids.
3707800	3710320	This is a children's crusade.
3710320	3711640	They're still fucking assholes.
3711640	3718240	They're, they're, they're, they would be valid if someone bought, bought them and started
3718240	3721920	coordinating them and saying, kids, um, uh, don't skip school.
3721920	3723560	We can do it on a Saturday afternoon.
3723560	3724960	My name is Mr. Henderson.
3724960	3727240	I'm the, I'm the 48 year old liberal.
3727240	3728480	That's going to like help you out.
3728480	3734200	Thanks for, thanks for having, we, we, we, is it, what an amazing concept, 16 year old
3734200	3740240	speaking up, um, um, wow, uh, uh, now let's use that to get Maxine Waters elected.
3740240	3744720	Like I just don't trust anybody kids, like, like I, because it won't, it doesn't matter
3744720	3746200	if their hearts in the right place or not.
3746200	3749400	Your power right now is that you're all that we have left.
3749400	3753960	Your power is that we, is that you're supposed to be off of the monopoly board and the, and
3753960	3757120	the game has, has become not a game anymore.
3757120	3759840	And the, you're the only thing that can help us.
3759840	3760840	Think about the pressure.
3760840	3767140	Uh, what's, what's the, uh, the, uh, I call BS girls name, uh, Emma Gonzalez, Emma Gonzalez.
3767140	3774020	She now has way more followers on Twitter than the NRA and she's what 17, 18 years old
3774020	3778740	and the NRA has fucking dank ass memes too.
3778740	3786340	So to be able to, to be that dank, the NRA has dank ass memes bro.
3786340	3794620	There's our show title, uh, but like, like she, like she was eloquence in the, in the
3794620	3803820	face of a massacre and now she's going to be held to a horrible scrutiny of like, of
3803820	3811940	asshole men and like men's rights activists and all this shit, NRA fucking looney tunes.
3811940	3820020	Like she, like her life is now having to be famous for speaking up, but also I think it's
3820020	3827460	crazy that the idea that we have to worship leaders of any kind, like I say, pour all
3827460	3832540	that energy into protecting these kids and it really has to be literally protecting them.
3832540	3834380	It can't be helping them.
3834380	3841540	It has to be shielding them because it's good to be disenfranchised by politicians.
3841540	3846400	And this is what happens to a society in total crisis is that it's like, it's like these
3846400	3854440	kids are going to either be eaten alive, um, in which case the dragon's going to get
3854440	3857840	even stronger and it's, we'll just look at it as a children's crusade.
3857840	3860720	It was just the final death throes of, of sanity.
3860720	3866040	It was just, we sent our children marching into, into the fray and, and because we were,
3866040	3871440	we were out of soldiers, um, or Birmingham, Alabama, they sent the kids out to protest
3871440	3875840	and they all got hosed down and the dogs were sent on them and it was like major turning
3875840	3876840	point.
3876840	3882080	I mean, these, these, these poor kids, uh, uh, before anyone, I'm 45 and I have, I don't
3882080	3885280	have a bone in my body that's prepared to make a sacrifice.
3885280	3890520	And these kids are 16 and they, they, they have to endure an actual Christ myth.
3890520	3895360	Like they have to actually atone with an, with some fucking crazy garden of guest themany,
3895360	3902360	um, uh, impersonal force that answers by not answering when you say, take this cup away.
3902360	3910320	Uh, and they, they have to march forward to Golgotha, um, knowing that there is no
3910320	3913800	fucking like celebration at the end of it.
3913800	3918360	They gotta, it's like, like it's only going to be abuse as like, you're going to have
3918360	3921640	your childhood taken away from you.
3921640	3926640	I think that happened when there was that's why if we, if we care at all, we have to just,
3926640	3932240	we have to just, we have to just whatever this means figuratively, we have to just gather
3932240	3939060	around them in a giant bubble, uh, with our backs to them facing outward, um, while they
3939060	3945160	do whatever they want to do until they drop dead from exhaustion and any bullet fired
3945160	3949760	their direction figuratively or literally hits one of us and that's what we have to
3949760	3950760	do.
3950760	3953060	That's what's, that's what's upon us in the face of this.
3953060	3955920	If we care, I don't know what that means.
3955920	3959520	I don't know how that actually physically expresses itself.
3959520	3960640	I don't know what to do.
3960640	3971480	I just feel like I just, I just want these kids to understand like that, you know, sorry,
3971480	3975160	like, like, like start, sorry that our football team is so shitty that you're on the field
3975160	3982440	with no equipment, um, and the ball is spiraling in the air and there's 400 linebackers headed
3982440	3983440	towards you.
3983440	3987760	I don't know anything about football, but, uh,
3987760	3997080	but, uh, but I, but I, but I do know either, either by virtue of the fact that we were,
3997080	4000280	we were never going to win or by virtue of the fact that this is the only way we're going
4000280	4005320	to win that this is, this is all, this is all we got and you're doing the right thing.
4005320	4007280	Don't listen to your parents.
4007280	4009560	Don't listen to your parents when they tell you they understand.
4009560	4013240	Don't listen to your parents when they tell you, uh, that your life is going to be ruined.
4013240	4016920	Uh, don't, don't, don't, don't listen to them.
4016920	4020400	Don't, don't, don't let them trick you in any way.
4020400	4022280	You have to use them.
4022280	4028480	You have to love them like, but don't let them get in your head because they don't have
4028480	4029480	the answers.
4029480	4031080	I am your parent's age.
4031080	4032160	I did nothing.
4032160	4040800	I watched, I watched all you kids die when you were my age and, and I did nothing.
4040800	4042680	So don't listen to us.
4042680	4047320	Support not advice is my advice.
4047320	4053280	If someone says here's $500 to make them sign a thing that says it's a, it's a, it's a gift.
4053280	4055840	I don't, I don't know.
4055840	4058960	I guess actually spit on it and throw it back on their face.
4058960	4061120	They've already taken like two and a half million dollars.
4061120	4062120	I'm sorry.
4062120	4064120	I thought that was a joke.
4064120	4065120	No.
4065120	4066120	Oh yeah.
4066120	4067120	Um, that's what I mean.
4067120	4069440	It's like, it doesn't invalidate them to take money.
4069440	4072040	It's like, give them money.
4072400	4077000	No, they're movement now and movements need to raise funds to keep going.
4077000	4080000	You can't do this shit forever for free.
4080000	4083900	Luckily they've grown up in a world where it's like, you can just go online and become
4083900	4086620	this character and make a living that way.
4086620	4091240	So they do kind of see this pathway, but it's not just like, they're not just being like,
4091240	4094120	oh, how do I become a public figure?
4094120	4098680	You know, it's like they've seen people their age being public figures for years and years
4098680	4102680	and they have a great reason to be out there, you know?
4102680	4105320	I hope we're, we're, we're dying empire.
4105320	4106320	It happens.
4106320	4107320	We had a good run.
4107320	4112640	Uh, we're Portugal, we're, we're, we're England, we're Spain.
4112640	4119240	We ruled the world for a couple hundred years and it's over and we're not going to go gracefully
4119240	4120480	into that good night.
4120480	4122600	We're not going to go gently.
4122600	4128320	What we're going to do is grab and profiteer as much as we can.
4128320	4131800	We're going to, we're going to take like the, the, the people in power are going to
4131800	4138200	steal as much as they can and then go team up with the next new empire, be that China
4138200	4142760	or Russia or North Korea or whatever the fuck, like, like we did it.
4142760	4143760	We're done.
4143760	4145000	We're fucked.
4145000	4149000	You can't be, um, a thousand year empire.
4149000	4153240	You can't be a Reich that goes on for fucking on and on and on.
4153240	4154240	We blew it.
4154240	4155240	We had a chance.
4155240	4157720	We did kind of a good job.
4157720	4159200	We made a lot of white people rich.
4159200	4163760	Uh, we made a lot of black people unhappy and now we don't care about the murder of
4163760	4165160	our own children.
4165160	4166160	This is the end.
4166160	4167720	We actually had a pretty short run.
4167720	4170840	Yeah, it should have been.
4170840	4175880	We squandered a lot of it that we're, we're too greedy, which we, we, well, I don't think
4175880	4177240	it's also a global phenomenon.
4177240	4178240	What's happening right now.
4178240	4181360	It's not just our, it's not just our American empire.
4181360	4187480	Just because we lasted 200 years compared to, I mean, Rome, like you would go six generations
4187480	4195600	before you got your mail, like everything moved at the speed of a campfire.
4195600	4202440	So like I, I, you know, if you adjust for technological inflation, we, we, we were ancient
4202440	4203440	Rome.
4203440	4204440	Yeah, exactly.
4204440	4213240	Like if it took 30 years to build an aqueduct, 200 years managing 8 billion people, uh, yeah,
4213240	4216000	and all their money, we burned brighter.
4216000	4217000	We burned faster.
4217000	4218000	We burned out.
4218000	4219920	And I don't think there's any shame in that.
4219920	4221960	I think what you do is you go, fuck it.
4221960	4222960	We're Portugal.
4222960	4229240	And now let's go out as the empire that at the, at the 11th hour, like a fucking Arnold
4229240	4235760	and terminator to giving the thumbs up, like, like that thumb is we love our Edward furlongs.
4235760	4237760	We love our kids.
4237760	4239840	Like we were, we lost.
4239840	4242280	We don't stop it.
4242320	4243320	Yeah.
4243320	4244320	Change that.
4244320	4245320	Quit it.
4245320	4246320	Jeff.
4246320	4247320	Love kids.
4247320	4249480	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm agreeing with you.
4249480	4250480	You're right.
4250480	4254080	We, we, we, we won't put that thumb up as we go down into the, uh, into the thing.
4254080	4259280	We support David hog one, one, one, one.
4259280	4260280	That's his ad.
4260280	4261280	That's his Twitter handle.
4261280	4267480	Uh, I don't think there's any shame in just saying like we are a great empire in a long
4267480	4271040	line of great empires that had their run and it's over.
4271800	4276680	Like now let's try to find a graceful way to enter into the next, like into our middle
4276680	4277680	age.
4277680	4278680	Sure.
4278680	4279680	We still got it.
4279680	4280680	Come on, man.
4280680	4281680	We win it back.
4281680	4287640	The shame is in, is in, is in looting wah wah because we see that like the shame is inciting
4287640	4288640	with entropy.
4288640	4290880	It doesn't matter if entropy is going to win or not.
4290880	4292480	The shame is inciting with it.
4292480	4298080	I also think that there's, there's two things that kind of led to what's going on right
4298080	4302560	now and you can look back at Rome for this example as well as one is the disbelief that
4302560	4304320	it's even possible that this can happen.
4304320	4310280	Like there's this notion of American superiority and this American dream idea, this ideal that
4310280	4316120	we're all kind of, uh, raised with that says like, well, America can never fail.
4316120	4317360	It will always work out.
4317360	4318360	It will always work out.
4318360	4324960	So there's a sense of denial, uh, in the American spirit that really is in disbelief of what's
4324960	4326120	actually happening right now.
4326120	4329240	And then also on the flip side, there's also the people who are like, oh, it's, you know,
4329240	4332840	it's always been fucked up and it's going to be fucked up and whatever it's over, it's
4332840	4333840	been over.
4333840	4336160	And why bother trying to change it?
4336160	4342280	So in between those two perspectives are people who might actually try to do something to
4342280	4349680	make something better right now, despite all evidence that it's either futile or whatever.
4349680	4356080	And you know, these kids are trying and maybe they, maybe they succeed and maybe we can't
4356080	4357080	turn it around.
4357080	4358080	I think it's worth.
4358080	4359080	Yeah.
4359080	4360080	Yeah.
4360080	4361080	Quit doubting the kids.
4361080	4362080	It's worth a fucking shot.
4362080	4363080	Right.
4363080	4364080	I believe in the kids.
4364080	4366080	There's a whole generation coming up right now.
4366080	4367560	We're about to see what happens.
4367560	4372760	We have to like pick a new leader, like, like, oh, it's going to be this person that's going
4372760	4373760	to save us.
4373760	4378680	There's going to be one new like figurehead that's going to save democracy.
4378680	4379680	That's crazy.
4379680	4380680	Right.
4380680	4381680	That approach is flawed.
4381680	4382680	Yeah.
4382680	4383680	Yeah.
4384280	4385280	Yes.
4385280	4386280	Turn out.
4386280	4387280	Go vote.
4387280	4391720	Go change in, you know, at the midterms, like, like, go, go make things happen.
4391720	4398800	But also don't root for your next Bernie Sanders or Hillary or Trump or whoever, like the idea
4398800	4406440	that we have to pick one person to make things all right, to be the leader of our rock band.
4406440	4407440	It's crazy.
4407440	4408440	I don't see that happening.
4408440	4412720	What I see is a lot of people suddenly actually getting involved in their local governments,
4412720	4416120	holding their representatives accountable, starting to go to these town hall meetings,
4416120	4419280	starting to make phone calls, all shit like that.
4419280	4423120	We've learned in the last year more than we ever knew before about how government works
4423120	4424860	because of this catastrophe.
4424860	4428520	We are sort of there is a silver lining here with Trump is a sort of like he's a rodeo
4428520	4432120	clown and he's a as Jeff says he's a amateur's autocrat.
4432120	4433120	Yeah.
4433120	4438360	He also is sort of like a thinly veiled drape over the fact if we play our cards right,
4438360	4442600	if we get through this, it could be the way that we realize the important thing, which
4442600	4448440	is that the office of the president is not, yeah, it's not supposed to be empowered and
4448440	4455720	is that empowered that that we are a republic and that our representatives in all of this
4455720	4461120	is fucked up to your system that this is an incredibly important this should be like underpaid
4461120	4465960	low level nerds that take care of us that you could tell to go fuck themselves because
4465960	4470080	if they can't handle being talked to by a 16 year old, it's just been shot at by an
4470080	4475000	air 15 like they're a fucking moron, then they don't qualify for the job.
4475000	4480200	Get me in, get me a fucking accountant in that office, get me a lawyer in that office.
4480200	4485760	So I have a million people on my payroll who know full well that that that that whether
4485760	4489160	they like me or not, they could go home and fantasize about me falling downstairs and
4489160	4490400	breaking my neck.
4490400	4495400	But during the 10 minute phone call about my taxes, they go absolutely, absolutely.
4495400	4498000	That's what you're supposed to say to the American public.
4498000	4504960	If you're a fucking Congress person, and these these are the people that are important and
4504960	4510920	they need to stop fucking acting like just because they're below the radar that they're
4510920	4517480	like not capable of shitting up our country, they're being held accountable for the first
4517480	4523360	time ever because also with such an inept leader, which is where everyone usually is
4523360	4529120	looking is at the you know, the the Wizard of Oz sitting up on top of the hill is supposed
4529120	4530640	to be the source of everything.
4530640	4534160	Meanwhile, there's all these other cogs in the machine that no one's really thinking
4534160	4537840	are very important, and they never are in their own damn states.
4537840	4540440	They're not actually talking to the people that they represent.
4540440	4543800	They're all up in Washington talking to lobbyists and shit.
4543800	4548320	So now that we have this inept guy in the office of the presidency, suddenly people
4548320	4550840	are going, wait, how does this work?
4550840	4555040	Okay, so I have to deal with my state legislators and okay, who are they?
4555040	4558320	Where do I find the directory for the people I call about this shit that's happening?
4558320	4561560	We need campaign reform so fucking bad.
4561560	4566280	It's been the most ludicrous journey just like going like over and over again, 85% of
4566280	4571520	the American public, 87%.
4571520	4575160	You better believe that includes all the fucking people that hate each other.
4575160	4579760	All agree campaign reform, I don't know who the fuck these 15% are, but I guess they're
4579760	4585160	probably the fucking parasites, the rich people, but everyone else is like, yeah, you
4585160	4586400	got to get money out of politics.
4586400	4588520	You just got to get it out.
4588520	4590680	It doesn't work.
4590680	4591960	So okay, what's the first step?
4591960	4594440	Well, let's make a law against money and politics.
4594440	4600520	Okay, let's take that vote, come to order all the people that ... It's an absurd, it's
4600520	4605640	like a comedy sketch, but we got to that poor mailman who rode his helicopter bike onto
4605640	4612680	the front steps of the Capitol lawn and it was just like ... He had one message, campaign
4612680	4613680	reform.
4613680	4616360	We need that so bad, it would solve every other problem.
4616360	4619120	Make these people civil servants.
4619120	4620840	Make this job.
4620840	4622880	You know why TV is good now?
4622880	4628320	Because they're getting so many channels, so many ways to watch TV, and all that shit-faced
4628320	4635640	coke addict fucking suit-clad assholes that never gave a fuck about what you watched on
4635640	4642400	television and looked at TV as a great way to fuck actresses and make a bunch of money,
4642400	4646480	their salaries didn't get very high.
4646480	4652640	They started getting bored, and they left, and Breaking Bad happened.
4652640	4656560	That is what you do to this country if you want to save it.
4656560	4660720	You suck the fucking money out of the spots that are important.
4660720	4667320	You suck the capitalism out of the things that are crucial, education, medicine, and
4667320	4669640	for my money, the Transformers franchise.
4669640	4670640	Hell yeah.
4670640	4671640	Michael Bay.
4671640	4673640	You know what?
4673640	4675600	That should never have been a for-profit venture.
4675600	4677160	These are robots that turn into cars.
4677160	4678160	Okay.
4678160	4679160	This belongs to the people.
4679160	4680160	What's up with Pacific Rim?
4680160	4682160	Is Pacific Rim about Transformers?
4682160	4683160	Is that?
4683160	4684160	I don't know.
4684160	4685160	Transformers.
4685160	4688840	It's also about Godzillas.
4688840	4693120	Any other questions?
4693120	4695080	You actually answered all my questions.
4695080	4697040	Hell yeah.
4697040	4701720	In the future, humans fight Godzillas with giant robots.
4701720	4707960	The place where I turned it off is when they started talking about how you need two pilots.
4707960	4712240	To balance the mental strain of the link.
4712320	4715960	Are we talking about Transformers or Pacific Rim?
4715960	4717920	That's Pacific Rim.
4717920	4721680	When they started back piping this shit about how you always need two pilots, I'm like,
4721680	4723720	well, I smell a rat here, plot-wise.
4723720	4728320	I feel like something's being forced onto me.
4728320	4732240	Stuff like that always pisses me off because it's like, I know how machines work.
4732240	4734000	I know how today's machines work.
4734000	4736920	You can't say you can't put a steering wheel on a fucking giant robot.
4736920	4740920	Is it like a producer meeting where they said, come on, we need to say hello to your new
4740920	4741920	partner scene?
4742600	4743960	Is the partner the robot?
4743960	4746400	No, the robot's a car.
4746400	4747400	Who's the partner then?
4747400	4749160	Does he drive the feet?
4749160	4750160	I don't know.
4750160	4751880	What if it's just the emotional strain?
4751880	4752880	Yeah.
4752880	4753880	There's two partners.
4753880	4754880	They both do it.
4754880	4759880	Finally, we protected the say hello to your new partner scene, the linchpin of all great
4759880	4760880	movies.
4760880	4765400	Have you seen these movies?
4765400	4770320	No, I turned it off when they started with the movie begins.
4770320	4776120	The first movie begins with, like, fucking Lord of the Rings, like, V.O., doesn't it?
4776120	4782000	First there was an ocean, then the Godzilla's came, and then we found out we needed two pilots,
4782000	4787040	one to handle the mental strain, and I was like, click, because I was like, I got a hard
4787040	4788040	enough time.
4788040	4790960	I would watch that movie if they were that honest about it.
4790960	4794160	First there was an ocean, then the Godzilla's came.
4794160	4795720	You know why you'd keep watching?
4795720	4799280	Because you'd go, finally, a movie cutting to the fucking business.
4799280	4804880	So if the third thing they said was, every robot, of course, needs two pilots, let me
4804880	4805880	finish.
4805880	4810160	You'd go, okay, you fucked up our relationship.
4810160	4817040	You came in here with, like, fucking sexy pants, and, like, you're cutting through the shit,
4817040	4818040	you know?
4818040	4819920	It's like that first date where you're like, I don't even believe in monogamy.
4819920	4820920	Yeah, me neither.
4820920	4825600	And then you're rolling around in the bed, and it's like, here's the thing, like, you
4825600	4827960	need to be a dentist when you meet my parents.
4827960	4828960	What?
4828960	4829960	This is so complicated.
4829960	4830960	It is complicated.
4830960	4831960	But it was fun.
4831960	4832960	I thought we were down the fucks.
4832960	4833960	So Pacific Rim is about Godzilla's coming out of the ocean and fighting who?
4833960	4834960	Who's the good guys or the bad guys?
4834960	4835960	Humanity.
4835960	4836960	Huh?
4836960	4837960	Humanity.
4837960	4838960	Humanity's a good guy.
4838960	4839960	Yeah.
4839960	4840960	Bad guys are Pacific Rim boogans that come out of the-
4840960	4841960	Godzilla's.
4841960	4842960	Yeah.
4842960	4843960	The Fisher's out of the Pacific Rim.
4843960	4845960	Out of the Pacific Rim itself.
4845960	4846960	Yeah.
4846960	4857960	So they come out of the volcanic cracks, these tectonic plates.
4857960	4860720	Giant ladybugs, giant grasshoppers.
4860720	4861720	They call them kaiju.
4861720	4862720	Kaiju.
4862720	4868080	Which is Japanese for big monster or some shit.
4868080	4869680	For big monster or some shit.
4869680	4873600	I think it's actually big monster or strange things.
4873600	4880080	Can I make a controlling, like, executive decision here?
4880080	4882280	Why are you asking?
4882280	4886760	Let's get these D&D sheets out.
4886760	4891440	We have, you know, we've got time to play, but also we need at least five, ten minutes
4891440	4896880	to talk about where the fuck we were because it's been a long time.
4896880	4901680	I say for better or for worse, we get back into this.
4901680	4905440	Last time there was a bear inside a toilet and there was some people running and we had
4905440	4910360	a dude and there was a shambling mass.
4910360	4915040	We need Spencer to break it down for us and tell us where we were.
4915040	4919680	We need to leave you up here, right?
4919680	4922240	In the birthday boy, get up here.
4922240	4926240	Steve, birthday boy.
4926240	4935240	Steve, leave me to the stage.
4935240	4943880	Oh, the simp version of me.
4943880	4948880	Speech, speech, speech.
4948880	4954560	Steve before we dispense the, uh, church, church everybody.
4954560	4957400	She's left us.
4957400	4968880	Uh, Levi, if you, if you could win, like, if you could accept one Oscar, what category,
4968880	4974600	like if you were up there tonight, what Oscar would be the dream, like, category for you
4974600	4977600	to accept one Academy Award?
4977600	4980600	What would the category be?
4980600	4988920	Like, it could be actor, it could be supporting actor, producer, sound designer.
4988920	4989920	It's hard.
4989920	4990920	It's hard.
4990920	4996520	There's the, there's the, the, the, the one that I actually think I'm like, if, you know,
4996520	5003440	my cards are played right, eventually I guess I could win the, like, producing best picture.
5003440	5004440	Yeah.
5004440	5005440	Best picture.
5005440	5006440	Yeah.
5006440	5009040	You know that, that could be, but like, what, what would be your, like, that might be the
5009040	5014960	most likely or is that the one that you want the most or would you like to just be some
5014960	5015960	other category?
5015960	5017720	I guess either that or best actor, right?
5017720	5020840	Those are the two best, biggest ones.
5020840	5021840	What was the question?
5021840	5026200	I was texting a guy that's Dan, I'll ask you the same question since you were texting a
5026200	5027200	guy.
5027200	5028640	Oh, that's obvious.
5028640	5034840	What category pick any Oscar category?
5034840	5037160	What would be the one that you would like to win?
5037160	5045960	Like if you were up there tonight, accepting an award, obviously costume design, like nobody
5045960	5046960	ever does it.
5046960	5047960	Right.
5047960	5048960	They don't understand.
5048960	5054480	You got to make, you got to make really big, uh, poofy hoop skirts.
5054480	5055880	You got to make a boofy hoop skirt.
5055880	5056880	Super.
5056880	5060640	I think Dan can win a best original screenplay Oscar.
5060640	5064120	I didn't even like your tone.
5064120	5071120	Like is there something about your tone that he might be able to get like fifth best movie.
5071120	5076360	What I, what I, what I, what I heard in that was that I, the, the, the lazy writer that
5076360	5077360	it's probable.
5077360	5078360	I won't know.
5078360	5082120	You're kind of like, I think, I think Dan could, I think Dan could do it.
5082120	5083120	No, that's not.
5083120	5084120	No.
5084120	5085120	Of course I could do it.
5085120	5087840	The question is, will I answers?
5087840	5088840	No.
5088840	5090920	Cause I'm retiring in five years.
5090920	5091920	I control.
5091920	5095040	I'm still thinking, are you retiring because you don't think you're good enough to win
5095040	5097120	best, uh, best original screenplay?
5097120	5098760	You should take this challenge.
5098760	5102800	I found out TV is a better racket than movies.
5102800	5108680	You know, I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, as long as I got my pride Spencer, how about you?
5108680	5113920	What category best supporting actress, right?
5113920	5114920	What are we talking about?
5114920	5119360	I was, I was going to say the same thing when, by the way, with all of our, our non-binary
5119360	5123440	revolution, when are we, when are we going to chop into that with an ice pick?
5123440	5124440	What?
5124440	5132960	Well, the concept that, that, that, that acting is divided by, uh, gender, two genders instead
5132960	5141520	of, I mean, when, when we, yeah, how far away are we from like, like best act, like whatever
5141520	5143920	the pronoun, probably just actor, right?
5143920	5149520	Like, but without, yeah, without having adding this like actress and actressa.
5149520	5154600	Well, I mean, the thing that will make that happen is when somebody is a trans character
5154600	5160920	that wins best trans gender role and they can't say best actor or actress.
5160920	5165640	Well, in, you know, in most cases they will be able to, because they'll be identifying
5165640	5167460	as either a man or a woman, right?
5167460	5171920	So then it'd have to be a very specific, like a gender trans person.
5171920	5173720	Yeah.
5173720	5174720	We got some time.
5174720	5178160	I wonder who won best cisgender male tonight.
5178160	5179160	Yeah.
5179160	5180160	Yeah.
5180160	5181160	We will never be gender.
5181160	5182160	Yeah.
5182160	5184920	We will always be cisgender.
5184920	5189560	We will always be cisgender.
5189560	5193360	I am coming out in a state of heteronormative nature.
5193360	5194360	Yes, yes.
5194360	5197760	I will be headed, we will be heteronormative on the beaches.
5197760	5199960	We will be heteronormative in the fields.
5199960	5203600	We will be heteronormative on the landing grounds, we'll always be cisgender.
5203600	5206600	Did that thing really happen where he got on the subway and asked everybody whether
5206600	5207600	it actually fight nonsense?
5207600	5208600	No, it fucking didn't happen.
5208600	5215200	He didn't get on the goddamn subway and pull, oh, hello, oh, governor, I'm a fucking, my
5215200	5217240	name is Roger Jones.
5217240	5218240	That's bullshit.
5218240	5222560	It never, if it happened, fuck you.
5222560	5223560	It certainly-
5223560	5225000	If it happened, fuck you.
5225000	5230120	It certainly didn't happen on his way back to the House of Lords to go deliver that speech
5230120	5234520	where he goes, you know what, I just talked to eight people that weren't rich people and
5234520	5235520	they really fucking-
5235520	5240800	Well, I also, the funny thing about that scene is that it's used as if it's a plot point,
5240800	5246000	but what he does with that information is he goes back to his political parasite friends
5246000	5257320	and says, I talked to Mary Jo Peasley and Geronimo Johnson and they take his word for
5257320	5258320	it.
5258320	5259320	It's almost like-
5260040	5263160	I think maybe the story is that he said I went-
5263160	5264160	He won Best Actor.
5264160	5265160	Well, that's what I'm saying.
5265160	5266160	He just won it?
5266160	5267640	He won it like 25 minutes ago.
5267640	5268640	Fuck him.
5268640	5272080	But that's what I'm saying.
5272080	5278480	I think that was the actual point of the story is that whether he did it or not, he said
5278480	5279480	he did it.
5279480	5282400	So if he didn't do it, the story is that he lied.
5282400	5288760	They probably truncated the fact that he actually didn't go listen to some common people and
5288760	5289760	didn't do it.
5289760	5293840	But the fact that he went on a subway and then that was what made that speech happen,
5293840	5294840	I find a little-
5294840	5300000	It's another one of those things where I- what was the other thing?
5300000	5301000	Sometimes I see something.
5301000	5309280	Oh, it was the cheeseburger phone call in Frost Nixon, where I'm like, that's so jammed
5309280	5314800	down the muzzle that it either has to be true or it's the crazy, egregious-
5314800	5317080	You got to jam it down the muzzle.
5318080	5323080	All right, Dan, pass down those character sheets.
5323080	5324080	Spencer?
5324080	5326080	Hey, guys.
5326080	5333080	Please do me a favor and fill me back in on what the hell had gone on recently.
5333080	5334080	Okay.
5334080	5335080	In our awesome campaign.
5335080	5341440	Well, and tell you what, don't play your music cue so that he feels like he has to perform
5341440	5342440	it.
5342440	5343440	Let him-
5347440	5348440	You cheat dinosaurs.
5348440	5352440	If you want information and you want it to be good, let him fucking-
5352440	5353440	Yeah.
5353440	5355440	Spencer, did you add a sheet to our-
5355440	5356440	Yeah.
5356440	5360440	I think Dan had that sheet, but I'm going to give it to you because you're more fastidious.
5360440	5361440	Ooh.
5361440	5362440	It's the group loot sheet.
5362440	5364440	It's our group loot.
5364440	5366440	All right.
5366440	5369440	Spencer, refresh our memories, please.
5369440	5370440	All right.
5370440	5376440	You guys were in Dor Nester on the quest for Patchen's Gem.
5376440	5381440	You infiltrated the town to get information and you found some information that seemed
5381440	5387440	to link this mysterious theater that seemed to be some sort of institution in the town
5387440	5394440	to Shrove and also information that said that Shrove might be in the bathroom of a tavern.
5394440	5399440	So you decided to abject Shrove from the tavern after the tavern master told you that that
5399440	5403440	would be a bad idea and it resulted in a big brawl.
5403440	5407440	So you guys escaped from the brawl and the brawl followed you outside into a back alley
5407440	5414440	where you guys escaped after Jeff started a fire and then Dan used like essentially
5414440	5420440	a flash bomb, like a blinding light to cover your exit.
5420440	5426440	Then you met up with a shambling mound who took you to safety that was north of a pig farm
5426440	5428440	in the wall of the city.
5428440	5430440	Is Shrove here or no?
5430440	5431440	No.
5431440	5433440	Well, he's not in the building.
5433440	5434440	Yeah.
5434440	5435440	Shrove's here.
5435440	5440440	He's just doing that thing he does where he's in stealth Shrove mode.
5440440	5442440	He's in silent running.
5442440	5445440	The well-known secret Shrove.
5445440	5447440	The well-known behaviors of Shrove.
5447440	5448440	Sorry.
5448440	5449440	That was my fault.
5449440	5450440	That was a dumb question.
5450440	5451440	It's fine.
5451440	5459440	So yeah, you were north of this pig farm in this kind of wreckage of a wall that he was
5459440	5462720	calling a house and it had a window in it.
5462720	5468400	So you had Shrove, you started I'll say interrogating, although that's a really loose way to refer
5468400	5469400	to it.
5469400	5470400	Ouch.
5470400	5471400	Everyone's a critic.
5471400	5472400	I am.
5472400	5473400	Yeah.
5473400	5477120	No, that's most of my job is critiquing what you guys are doing and being frustrated.
5477120	5480840	So we didn't torture him good enough.
5481840	5484120	I feel like you might have a dragon tattoo on his back.
5484120	5485120	Was that important?
5485120	5487120	Did we hit a dragon mark tattoo?
5487120	5488620	Well, I did say it.
5488620	5493160	So yeah, it was a dragon tattoo that we identified with one of Gary Shambling's books as being
5493160	5499120	part of this dragon cult that was a dragon mark, not a cult.
5499120	5505040	And we asked him, can he read the guild script in the note?
5505040	5510360	So he translated the note and he wouldn't, he stopped short of giving us the location
5510360	5513040	of the drop point for Patchen's gem.
5513040	5514040	Right.
5514040	5518960	But we know that the note had a drop point and that the time was within hours.
5518960	5526680	And Gary Shambling also had a map that had a list of locations in and around the town
5526680	5528480	and it was written in that guild language.
5528480	5532320	So you couldn't read it, but it also seemed to have locations on it.
5532320	5534080	Is Gary Shambling still with us right now?
5534080	5536080	You just asked that.
5536080	5537080	Answer me again.
5537080	5538080	I'll get there.
5538080	5540560	Let them let them go finish the yeah.
5540560	5547080	So you guys had that you were on the cusp of making a big discovery and then instead
5547080	5550920	of holding them, I think I think you switched to tying them up.
5550920	5554480	But Dan had Steve tie him up and Steve did a bad job tying him up.
5554480	5559640	So he ended up just kind of slipping out of his bindings and sneaking out of the window.
5559640	5562320	Although it would be fair when he started sneaking out of the window, you guys kind
5562320	5566240	of just let him leave like you didn't chase him or like try and grab him and speak to
5566240	5567240	that.
5567800	5569040	I think your memory is.
5570560	5571920	You're kind of looking back on it and going.
5572960	5576840	Am I a great dungeon master and you're going to tend to go?
5576840	5578400	Yeah, no, I think I'm terrible.
5578400	5579880	Well, here's what happened.
5580320	5581400	It was a bit of a fracas.
5582160	5583760	Right. We were beating him.
5585880	5592640	Yeah. And he, according to you, he fucking like ninja'd out of his ropes and started
5592640	5594400	beating the fuck out of us.
5594400	5595160	I don't think so.
5595160	5598600	Revealing himself to be super powerful.
5599040	5602360	And then he like flew out the window like a goddamn pixie.
5602640	5606880	I like like like it was it was you're making it seem like we watched him slowly crawl out
5606880	5612000	the window like this guy like like revealed that he had like NPC powers that were like,
5612120	5613320	you're never supposed to kill me.
5613320	5614560	I'm supposed to fucking kill you.
5614560	5618680	And it jumped up and it was like, yeah, I was like and then he like jumped out the window
5618680	5619560	like a laser beam.
5619560	5623080	I don't I mean, I'll believe you if you say he attacked, but I don't remember him
5623080	5623680	attacking you.
5623680	5625720	I just remember you guys all had combat turns.
5625720	5630160	I didn't try and grab him down that this is Shrove won't cooperate.
5630160	5631120	We beat him up.
5631320	5633400	Yeah, he for sure kicked our ass.
5633400	5634440	He took a piece out of us.
5634440	5638080	I think he fought you pretty hard when you initially fought him in the dark.
5638080	5640200	But I don't remember him fighting you really hard enough.
5640200	5644080	But I can't I was already almost dead, which is why I let him go.
5644120	5646960	Yeah, that's the thing is you were already almost dead.
5647320	5649280	So he escaped into the night.
5650120	5657440	Um, I also have written down Spencer in my notes that the top priority is the purse.
5658240	5660280	That was the that was what the note said.
5661440	5662640	The note said the purse.
5662640	5667320	The purse is the purse is the gem drop point north is the town of Dornaster.
5669760	5671280	All right, go ahead.
5671280	5675520	So then you guys you were like, I don't know what we should do.
5675520	5677120	And then Pat.
5677120	5678000	No, not pageants.
5678000	5681960	Steve was like, I know we should do ask more questions.
5681960	5685360	And you went to the store owner and the store owner was like, I don't know.
5685600	5689240	And then he sprayed you in the face with presumably knockout juice.
5689600	5692640	And you guys were like, we love this adventure we're on.
5692640	5695160	And we want to keep doing the adventures forever.
5696080	5699960	Well, I mean, is that your way of giving us a second chance?
5699960	5701920	No, no, that was just my memory.
5703120	5704160	Are you doing it?
5704160	5707360	Are you guys doing a bit where you pretend not to remember anything that happened,
5707360	5710080	but then suddenly have perfect memory of certain moments?
5710080	5713720	I do have perfect memory of one aspect of it, which is that I fully fucking
5713720	5718880	bailed in humiliation and I was like, I don't know what I'm doing.
5718880	5721360	We fucked up at the house where we set the guys house on fire.
5721600	5722720	We fucked up here again.
5722720	5726000	And I started walking down the road with my compatriots and one of them,
5726000	5731880	the erstwhile diarrhea junior, doubled back over our protests to go to go fucking.
5732520	5736040	Hang out in a town that nobody likes us in that we just yeah.
5736040	5741120	And and and that was the way we ended is that Jeff and I were like on the road
5741120	5743640	and we had told this kid, don't go back.
5743640	5744560	And he went back.
5744560	5746400	And then you told him he got captured.
5746400	5748520	And then that's where we had said, fuck.
5748520	5750200	I don't remember that passion's gem.
5750200	5753000	We're going to go back to town and start start anew.
5753000	5755400	Right. Well, I'm very happy to rewind a little bit.
5756560	5759640	So that we're not on the road leaving town, because I feel like
5760640	5765960	the benefit of a month of thinking about our decisions is like, well,
5765960	5771680	is there's a drop point in in Doran Esther drop point north.
5771680	5774280	We did. We're on the quest for Patches Gem Patches.
5774280	5777120	Gem is being dropped off like like.
5777120	5778560	So I don't know where you want to place us.
5778560	5780960	And I gave my version.
5780960	5783840	And what do you want to definitely call it a quiz?
5783840	5785600	And I ran back and I don't remember that.
5785600	5788360	How do you want to how do you want to you're outside of town?
5789080	5790720	Well, that's OK.
5790720	5795280	Yeah. So we have left diarrhea junior behind because he wanted
5795280	5798000	to fucking interrogate people back.
5798000	5799520	And no, you don't leave them behind.
5799520	5802000	You guys were leaving. He was like, you know what, fuck this.
5802000	5806360	I'm a young upstart with nothing to lose or like the like the kids
5806360	5808280	from the shooting.
5808280	5811280	Yeah, that was when I originally started writing this adventure.
5811280	5815080	I was like, one of these days, this is going to be a this is going to be
5815080	5817480	a socially resonant metaphor.
5817480	5819520	All right. Well, it hit it hit home.
5819520	5821960	Wait, I saw. Did we bail on Patches Gem?
5822480	5823880	Didn't we decide? I did.
5823880	5824880	Yes, I'm not.
5824880	5826880	I'm not willing to corroborate that.
5826880	5827840	Well, I did.
5827840	5832520	We were on the road outside of town because I said, let's just just get out of here.
5832520	5834440	It's the reason I ran back into town.
5834440	5836320	I don't want to give up on it.
5836320	5839120	Diarrhea Junior is still on the quest for Patches.
5839920	5841200	You and I said, fuck it.
5841200	5842840	Let's just restart.
5842840	5845880	Let's let's hit control alternate to go somewhere else.
5845880	5848120	Yeah, do another thing.
5848120	5852480	But. OK, so where are we standing right now, Spencer?
5853920	5855080	You're outside of the town.
5855080	5859320	It's surrounded by a big thick wall that's about 10, 15 feet tall.
5859320	5860880	So it's like you're kind of outside.
5860880	5862520	It's a day or night. It's nighttime.
5862520	5863880	It's dark.
5863880	5867040	It's it's being lit by the flickering light of a town on fire.
5867040	5868800	Are we on foot?
5869800	5870960	Me and Carlos.
5870960	5872200	You're on foot. Yeah.
5872200	5877440	Yeah, I said to Carlos, Carlos, I feel bad that DJ is back in town.
5878200	5882040	Like we're nothing if not a team.
5882800	5885720	We're not even good as a team, but we're worse alone.
5886400	5889680	We should go get DJ back. Right.
5890560	5893400	Look. Or don't look.
5893400	5895400	I mean, I it's nighttime.
5895400	5896880	I'm not a good leader.
5896880	5899520	Like I I I I fucked up.
5899640	5904400	I just I just but I we were we were a team walking out of town
5904400	5908520	and then diarrhea went back like he shouldn't have.
5908520	5909520	We told him not to.
5909520	5914000	OK, I he'd be standing with us right now if we if he had been a team.
5914000	5915680	I whistle.
5915680	5918000	I do like a like I can't do it.
5918000	5920400	I put my fingers in the mouth and do a whistle
5920400	5923160	that I think that diarrhea junior would recognize.
5923160	5926080	You make the whistle.
5926080	5928160	Yeah, no, you hear nothing.
5928160	5932960	All right. Well, we we have to we have to get our ducks in a row about this.
5935040	5937720	This this drop point like it's if we're
5938040	5942400	if we're going to complete the quest for Patcheons, Jim, it is upon us.
5942840	5944720	It I would argue.
5946160	5949760	That a diarrhea junior even is like secondary to it
5949760	5953200	because the deadline for one of them is within hours.
5953200	5955280	That's the one thing that we knew.
5955280	5957360	We just don't know where in Doran Esther,
5958560	5962160	the the drop point for the Germans drop point north.
5962200	5963160	We have to find.
5963160	5965560	I believe drop point north is Doran Esther.
5965840	5969000	And it's the actual location within Doran Esther that he wouldn't give us.
5969240	5971560	He read it and he wouldn't give it to us.
5971560	5976280	He's he's using that Dragon Mark knowledge to read the thing.
5976800	5979360	He saw crucial information.
5979360	5984000	I mean, obviously, he has more loyalty to
5985000	5986840	his kind.
5986840	5989560	I guess that would make him a person to follow.
5989920	5992920	If we could figure out where he would go. Who?
5995000	5996880	Shrove Shrove.
5996880	5999320	Yeah, he'd go to the theater.
5999320	6000640	I mean,
6001800	6003680	drop point north.
6004680	6007600	If I'm a if I'm a band of.
6009920	6013560	Shitty people that doesn't mind killing people to get a gym.
6014160	6017200	And then I'm arranging to drop it off and.
6018560	6020800	I mean, where do you go?
6023360	6025560	I have no idea.
6025560	6026840	We can't go back into town.
6026840	6029000	They all know us.
6029920	6032040	We can't go back to Doran Esther.
6032040	6034720	I think we just we just set it on fire.
6034720	6038320	And and and and I just I mean,
6038320	6042560	maybe the passion's gym thing was just a wild goose chase.
6042560	6044080	Maybe we just.
6044080	6045960	All right. You know what?
6045960	6048320	Let's split the difference.
6048320	6050160	Let's go rescue shit face.
6051800	6053960	Shit face diarrhea.
6053960	6056840	Well, the kid that he he's your friend,
6056840	6060040	you call him shit face now, he doesn't.
6061560	6062560	He went back.
6062560	6063560	I was told him not to.
6063560	6064360	I just whistled.
6064360	6065400	He didn't respond.
6065400	6066880	Maybe he's having a good time.
6066880	6068960	It means he's let's go.
6068960	6070600	Let's go sneak back into town.
6070600	6073880	Do you have any way of disguising people, huh?
6073880	6075480	Just stealthing them or you're wearing
6075480	6077640	like a weird clown outfit that you buy.
6077640	6079600	Yeah, I'm wearing a weird clown outfit.
6079600	6082000	But maybe you should take that off because it's wearing
6082000	6083920	when we set fire to the town and we can.
6083920	6087880	So I go back into my regular colorful gnome druid.
6087880	6089920	Cool. I cast.
6090680	6092880	Appear as someone else.
6092880	6094160	I don't think you have it.
6094160	6095480	OK, all right.
6095480	6098560	Just it's a good spell, though.
6099560	6100560	All right. Yeah.
6100560	6105080	Meanwhile, diarrhea, you get sprayed in the face
6106560	6107680	by a chemical.
6107680	6109600	What's your fortitude save?
6109600	6112960	Do you know where saves are on the left side?
6113320	6115360	Maybe a third of the way down.
6115360	6117840	Yeah, it says total is three.
6117840	6118840	OK.
6120680	6122240	All right.
6122240	6125800	You can feel yourself getting woozy as you lose consciousness.
6125800	6126800	Oh.
6128560	6130600	Oh, boy. You're out cold.
6130600	6132200	He got sprayed by what?
6132200	6135400	By a chemical like a guy sprayed him with something.
6137760	6140400	Because he was back there trying to talk shit and make friends.
6141040	6143800	Yeah, he was as he was talking to a store owner.
6145120	6146080	All right.
6146080	6149400	Soon after or, you know, an indescribable amount of time
6149400	6151240	or indeterminable amount of time afterwards,
6151240	6154800	you wake up in a wooden room lit by candles, the wooden room.
6154800	6157760	You can tell the walls are are these black stained
6157760	6161240	wooden planks and the smell of this room is a bit wet and earthy,
6161240	6162920	kind of musty.
6162920	6166000	You're tied up with just so much really heavy rope.
6166440	6170400	You're in like a place where there's kind of it looks maybe like a lounge area.
6170400	6172120	There's like couches and a card table.
6172120	6174400	And you see about three people in the room.
6174480	6178360	Oh, and then there's also you see patches who's he's tied up as badly as you.
6178360	6182240	But he's knocked out and he's across across the room like you're on opposing walls.
6184000	6187240	So, yeah, there's a fire and there's a door in one direction,
6187240	6188400	a hallway in one direction.
6188400	6191840	And you can also see a big bulletin on the board on the wall and a target.
6191840	6193440	And they're kind of full of knives.
6193440	6197120	Is this is this so much later that I mean, shouldn't we?
6197680	6199840	I mean, if he was unconscious for a while, shouldn't we?
6204360	6207880	You didn't care about him in in X amount of time.
6207880	6210520	So the scene we just had was time shifted.
6210840	6213360	OK, that was just not caring about it.
6213760	6215920	Well, it was. Yeah, it was. Yeah.
6215920	6218200	Like the time it took us to walk outside of town.
6218400	6221320	Yeah, because he ran back in and you're like, well, he'll come back.
6221400	6223640	He won't come back. Whistle, you know, all that.
6223640	6225680	So he's in a room with knives on the wall.
6225840	6228720	Yeah, there's like a bulletin board and a map on the wall.
6228720	6233000	And they're all kind of full of knives like, yeah, like throwing knives,
6233040	6234880	like people are throwing throwing knives.
6235720	6237120	So I just woke up.
6237120	6239560	Yeah. And you're tied up to a wall.
6239560	6242960	I see patches and I see three people in the room with me.
6242960	6245080	Yeah, they're at the card table playing cards.
6246120	6249840	OK, in my mind, I'm thinking, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.
6249880	6250880	What the hell is going on?
6250880	6253080	There's patches.
6253080	6256080	I'm I can't move.
6256080	6259920	But I decided I'm going to play it really cool and be like,
6260680	6263440	whoa, this room is sweet.
6263440	6266120	Hey, guys, I'm diarrhea.
6266120	6268440	People call me DJ for short.
6268440	6270160	Thank you for bringing me to your party.
6270160	6272160	I want to play games. What games are you playing?
6273160	6275080	Well, he's awake.
6275560	6276720	Go hit him.
6276720	6279240	One of the guys comes over and he punches you in the face.
6280640	6281920	Keep quiet.
6281920	6283320	You're a prisoner.
6283320	6285440	You're our prisoner.
6285440	6286440	Shut up.
6287720	6290240	Well, why am I a prisoner?
6290240	6292320	Because you guys were trying to kidnap Shrove.
6293920	6295400	I mean, you did kidnap Shrove.
6295400	6297360	I gave him I was throwing money at him.
6297360	6299800	I was not trying to kidnap him.
6299800	6301720	Yeah, I'm sure.
6301720	6302720	There's three people.
6302720	6304160	Who's that other guy across the room?
6304160	6305320	Why is he tied up?
6305320	6306520	He's another weirdo.
6306520	6308040	We don't know who he's associated with.
6308040	6311760	But now that there's a bunch of strangers coming in like committing kidnappings,
6311760	6312960	we decided not to take any chance.
6312960	6314280	Who did that guy kidnap?
6314280	6316720	We don't know, but we didn't recognize him.
6316720	6318200	We're not taking risks.
6318200	6319240	What's your name?
6319240	6320240	My name.
6321880	6323400	Yeah. Oh, yeah.
6325240	6326480	Your name is Oh, yeah.
6326480	6328320	Oh, Jesus.
6332040	6333920	This is a very confusing conversation.
6333920	6335840	My name is Clam Double.
6335840	6337000	Clam Double.
6337000	6338800	Yeah, like the seafood.
6338800	6339320	Got it.
6339320	6341880	Is that your given name or is that your nickname?
6341880	6343840	No, we all have nicknames down here.
6343840	6344640	How did you earn?
6344640	6345480	How did you earn that one?
6345480	6346200	It's fascinating.
6346200	6347160	I'm not talking to you.
6347160	6347840	You're a prisoner.
6347840	6348840	Shut up.
6350960	6351520	OK.
6351520	6351800	All right.
6351800	6355000	So back to not you, Steve.
6355000	6356160	Back to not Steve.
6356160	6359720	You know, Carlos and I are outside of Dornest.
6359720	6363080	You're wondering whether we should go back and we got to go back.
6363080	6364560	You kind of wanted to go back, it sounds.
6364560	6368080	Yeah, we got to go back and get DJ and fucking figure shit out.
6371960	6375200	We I'm going to,
6376280	6379560	you know, take the I'm not going to walk up the main road.
6379560	6385240	I'm going to creep through the tall grass, the back, back, back, back roads.
6386800	6388800	And I'm trying to trying to be sneaky.
6388800	6391480	It's not my specialty.
6391480	6392240	How do you OK?
6392240	6395440	So there's two main entrances in and out of Dornaster,
6395440	6399040	or you could like climb over the wall or something.
6399040	6402880	Yeah, I mean, what is the main entrance guarded?
6402880	6403880	It's usually guarded.
6403880	6407880	But because of the fire, the guards are helping with the fire.
6407880	6410480	Well, looks like we can go on through.
6410480	6411600	We can sneak in.
6411600	6412080	Where is he?
6412080	6413400	Where were we going to look?
6413400	6415440	I guess we go to the theater and go to the theater.
6415440	6425280	Yeah, so we remember where the theater is, so we had there.
6425280	6427240	OK, you go to the theater.
6427240	6431560	It's a large, black, modern looking building made out of black stained planks.
6431560	6435640	There's the large front door is as closed as it was before.
6436800	6438840	All right, I don't recommend we knock.
6442640	6444680	I open the door.
6444680	6447160	All right, it's locked.
6447160	6448640	I unlocked the door.
6448640	6450440	How do you how do you try to do that?
6450440	6454000	I use my lock.
6454000	6456760	I don't know that you have thieves tools or anything.
6456760	6460400	Let's look around the building for other points of ingress.
6461240	6462880	OK. All right.
6462880	6466440	Around the back, you can see there seems like a little kind of kitchen area.
6466440	6469120	There's a small door and it's got a couple of windows.
6469120	6469920	That's how you can see.
6469920	6471600	There's like it looks kind of like a kitchen.
6471600	6474200	There's the kitchen stuff.
6474640	6476560	I try to open one of the windows.
6476560	6477320	It's locked.
6477320	6479440	Is there anybody in the kitchen?
6479440	6482160	No, it seems like it's a pretty quiet inside.
6482160	6483760	Try the small door.
6483760	6484600	It's locked.
6484600	6488600	I take my quarter staff and break a window and then I can clear out the glass
6488600	6490720	so we can crawl through. All right.
6492560	6495400	You do it. It's great.
6495400	6497440	You punch a hole clean through the window.
6497440	6501320	It's just like it's it's not like a big shattering.
6501320	6504240	It's just kind of like you just knocked a big chunk out of the glass
6504240	6507560	and it just kind of landed on the floor in one big piece. Perfect.
6507960	6510040	Yeah, you open the window.
6510040	6512960	Can you when you get through, can you open the door for me?
6513080	6515280	Yeah, I crawl through and open the window for him.
6515320	6516880	Hell yeah. That happens.
6516880	6518000	Now you're in a kitchen.
6518000	6520600	You see sausages and cheese. Oh, yeah.
6520640	6523000	I take I take two sausages and one cheese.
6523680	6525680	OK. Just just just in case.
6525680	6527520	That's fair. All right.
6529000	6530600	What's our plan?
6530600	6533680	Our plan is to find diarrhea, Junior or Shrove.
6534960	6538040	Well, yeah, I mean, in that order, I guess.
6538760	6540120	Well, we don't know.
6541120	6545760	Yeah, we don't know that either of them are here, but I guess
6547880	6550320	should we split up, cover more ground?
6550320	6552320	Yeah, let's let's let's split up.
6553360	6554640	You like it when we split up, right?
6554640	6556880	Yeah, there's only one door, though.
6556880	6559360	OK, let's not split up until we get through a door
6559360	6561680	that has more than two doors.
6561680	6563360	Let's stay together through this first door.
6563360	6565240	Good idea. We open that door.
6565360	6569080	All right. You you go through the door and you see a narrow hallway
6569080	6573520	that leads into the main space of the theater itself.
6573520	6576360	Like so you can see kind of the main audience space
6576360	6579640	and then the main stage, which is a pretty huge construction.
6579640	6583880	There's catwalks overhead and kind of rigs for ropes
6583880	6586280	and curtains and stuff like that to the right.
6586280	6589880	There's a door and then to the and then past that door.
6589880	6591400	There's also another door to the right.
6591400	6594200	And then then there's kind of like a backstage area.
6594200	6595880	But those are the only kind of rooms.
6595880	6599960	There's there's only the only rooms you see are like these two rooms,
6599960	6602680	the kitchen and then this whole big kind of stage space.
6604520	6607680	Well, there's two doors.
6607680	6609560	I'll take the first door.
6609560	6613240	I'll take the second. OK, I listen to mine first.
6613680	6616080	You don't hear anything in either.
6616080	6618560	OK, I open I try to open the first door.
6618880	6620720	It's a it's a bathroom.
6620720	6623440	It looks like a nice bathroom like it's a performer's bathroom.
6623640	6625640	I take a giant shit.
6625640	6629000	It's great. You feel well taken care of. OK.
6630840	6631840	What's behind my door?
6631840	6634680	It's like it's like a green room kind of lounge area.
6634680	6637640	There's just kind of sitting and it's kind of centrally located
6637640	6640000	to be kind of near the stage and kind of out of the way.
6640440	6643760	It's pretty empty. Yeah, nothing.
6643760	6645560	No, no, no ways out from there.
6646040	6649600	No, it's just yeah, it's just like like a housing room.
6649640	6650640	Let's check backstage.
6650640	6654640	All right. I'm done taking a poop and I come out and rejoin Carlos.
6654640	6655800	We go backstage.
6659800	6660560	All right.
6660560	6664000	You're searching around and then backstage and you find a number of levers.
6664000	6665200	There's five levers.
6665200	6667800	They seem to be connected to various ropes and things
6668120	6672160	like that, like winches and pulleys and sandbags sort of things.
6674760	6677280	If we're running through here later, let's pull all of these
6677280	6679200	and maybe some shit will fall on the people that are chasing us.
6679560	6680400	Yeah, I like that.
6680400	6682800	All right. Anywhere anywhere to go.
6684080	6687520	Um, no, it's just like behind a stage, you know.
6687960	6689600	Oh, all right.
6692320	6694640	So we're just on stage.
6695200	6697720	Let's go back to Steve.
6699560	6700960	Hey, hey, guys.
6700960	6703080	Hey, hey, guys, do you like pizza?
6703120	6704640	Do you like pizza?
6704640	6707080	Pizza doesn't exist.
6710360	6712600	What are you talking about?
6712600	6713480	I actually don't know.
6713480	6715040	This is a good question.
6715040	6716160	Do you like the word pizza?
6716160	6717080	I just made it up.
6717080	6718080	Yeah, it sounds great.
6718080	6720720	Cool. Me too. Bros for life. Bros for life.
6720800	6722080	Hell yeah.
6722080	6724280	I like you guys.
6724280	6726360	We hate you. Why?
6727400	6728440	It seems unfounded.
6728440	6731040	I didn't do anything wrong.
6731760	6734840	Yeah, no, you guys killed.
6734840	6737160	You guys are like attacking our people.
6737160	6738560	Who's you guys?
6738560	6741080	These strangers are coming into our town.
6741080	6742840	We saw you with them.
6742840	6744480	Yeah, because I'm like their slave.
6744480	6746000	You saved me.
6746000	6748240	Oh, that's a new development.
6749640	6751680	You don't lead with that.
6752400	6755240	What? You knew why you were captured.
6756120	6758560	Well, I well, I mean,
6759000	6761480	you got to do what you're told to do when you're a slave.
6761480	6763000	But Steve, while you're talking,
6763000	6767320	you can hear footsteps above your head on like the wooden boards.
6770040	6772840	I just start making fart noises really loud with my hands.
6773200	6774440	Oh, wait, I can't do it with my hands.
6774440	6776280	So I can do with my my mouth.
6776280	6777640	So I'm just going like
6778840	6780520	I'm just like, that's the sound.
6780520	6783960	Like I know that they'll understand what's happening, you know, like.
6784960	6791640	All right, Carlos, you hear a farting sound.
6791640	6792760	Did you hear that fart sound?
6792760	6795680	Followed by the sound of guards beating someone out.
6795720	6797920	It's hard not to abuse this inside information.
6799360	6800200	I heard a fart sound.
6800200	6803600	Yeah, I mean, that's the sound that he always makes when he's in trouble.
6806200	6808400	Sounds like he's below us.
6808400	6809760	Yeah. All right.
6809760	6813400	I look for a way to get down like below the stage.
6814200	6816320	The stage is kind of sealed off.
6816320	6818440	But wait, let's do a search.
6818960	6822200	If he's making those fart sounds, either he just makes them constantly
6822480	6823880	or he could hear that.
6823880	6826120	That means that that's his way of communicating.
6826560	6828600	Does that mean he could hear us up here?
6828600	6829960	He heard footsteps above.
6829960	6833120	Well, I think then so did the bad guys.
6834800	6837840	Well, the bad guys are working Steve over for making farting sounds.
6839800	6841480	But yeah, it's the Jeff.
6841480	6846200	You spy, you spy the the thinnest, faintest outline of a rectangle,
6846280	6848280	a trap door in the stage.
6848280	6850360	I open that rectangle trap door.
6850440	6854280	You can't. It's like the you can't you can't sneak your little fingers in there.
6854280	6855920	It's so such a tight thing.
6855920	6856920	Levers.
6858040	6862360	I examine the lever mechanisms and see if like I assume like, you know,
6862360	6866840	I I'm no stranger to the theater as a man of a cloth.
6867920	6870480	You know, it's all performance.
6870480	6874040	So I'm looking at pulleys and ropes and going like, well, is there anything
6874040	6877960	that I can rule out as something that would potentially open the trap door?
6879040	6882800	There's one that seems like it's definitely not the trap door.
6883160	6884160	I found it's in the middle.
6884160	6885960	I got it down to four.
6885960	6886960	OK.
6888240	6890080	I guess I just start pulling them all.
6890080	6891080	All right.
6892800	6894160	Walk me through the methodology.
6894160	6896480	You start with one and then wait or something.
6898720	6899560	Yeah.
6899560	6902880	Because, you know, there's like cockpit smashing all the buttons simultaneously.
6904040	6905920	I'm one at a time.
6906200	6909040	I'm I'm no, I'm just I'm I'm going.
6909440	6911640	I'm going like this. Here's what I'm doing.
6911640	6914360	Crank, crank, crank, crank.
6915280	6917760	Like I'm not really waiting to see what happens. OK.
6918920	6924320	Yeah, you pull them all a couple sandbags drop out of like the rafters and stuff
6924320	6926880	and smash into the ground and just kind of spill sand over.
6926880	6930880	And then the the trap door starts lowering in the stage.
6932600	6934920	Sweet. Ooh.
6934920	6936320	Starts lowering like.
6936320	6939880	Yeah, it's like retracting into the below ground.
6939880	6942280	I think it's like a is it a hinge or what is it?
6942280	6943600	No, it's like a lift.
6943600	6946800	Oh, OK. So it's going down like a dumb waiter platform.
6946800	6947800	Oh, OK.
6949160	6951600	I get on that lowering your platform.
6952360	6954440	You do that. You're on it.
6954440	6956240	It's lowering. What about you, Dan?
6956240	6957920	Can I fit on there with?
6957920	6959960	Oh, yeah, Chad.
6959960	6961920	I could like hold a horse or all right.
6961920	6965040	Well, let's fucking horse.
6965040	6966200	He loves horses.
6966200	6968400	All right. So we're lowering down on the thing. Yeah.
6969280	6971000	Yeah, you go into the thing.
6971000	6974880	You see, it's kind of like a waiting room kind of area.
6974880	6976000	It's completely empty.
6976000	6976920	There's no one in it.
6976920	6979440	It seems like there's a place where you could put your weapons
6979440	6982080	and other equipment and some coat racks and stuff.
6982360	6985920	It's just kind of like a waiting area for you to hang out
6985920	6989520	for you to stage goods in the platform area for the trap door and stuff.
6990040	6992320	There's a door. Hmm.
6992320	6994560	All right. Listen at the door.
6996520	6998960	Yeah. All right.
6999200	7001440	What do you what do you want to do?
7001440	7003320	How do you want to do this?
7004320	7009040	I. I'm looking for my spells real quick.
7010360	7012480	Not that I think this is going to be an issue,
7012480	7015400	but we should probably try to take one of them alive.
7016760	7019640	I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not
7020440	7023680	assuming we're going to be able to kill them all.
7024200	7026720	Dan, you realize that your health is really low.
7026720	7029120	Wait, but I thought, oh, yeah, I guess I.
7030200	7031520	Shit. What do you think?
7031520	7033520	Well, I thought, yeah, I guess I lost track.
7033520	7036240	I thought that I I give them some good berries.
7037680	7042120	Do you have any usually historically speaking?
7042480	7044680	Well, I can heal myself, right? Yeah.
7045680	7047440	Um, how do I do that?
7047440	7051840	Am I am I am I giving up a spell?
7051920	7055000	So if you find what spell load out you have,
7055320	7059040	you can turn any level one or two spell into a heal spell.
7059160	7062760	I'm going to conveniently assume I was doing load out three offense.
7062760	7064840	I think you were. So I will.
7064840	7069080	Yeah, I will sacrifice my inflict moderate wounds touch
7071080	7073360	in order to heal myself.
7073360	7075480	How much damage does that do?
7075480	7078240	Um, 2d8 plus one.
7078360	7082480	OK, does that matter or the healing is the same basically?
7082480	7085080	So but what if I had said summon monster two?
7085360	7087600	Well, it's just specifically inflict and heal
7087600	7089440	are the same spell, the opposite.
7089440	7093040	So so I couldn't I wouldn't have been able to sacrifice
7093040	7096520	summon monster two to do a heal spell. No, you could.
7097840	7099040	And it would be the same.
7099040	7100960	Then why did you ask?
7100960	7102400	Oh, you just asked as a shortcut
7102400	7103840	because so you didn't have to look it up. Right.
7103840	7106120	OK, you gave back 12 health.
7107120	7108120	Brrr.
7111480	7115200	All right. So what's burning hands, by the way?
7115200	7116640	I can't I can't find the description.
7116640	7117840	It's an AOE spell.
7117840	7119240	It deals your level three.
7119240	7121840	I think it should deal 3d4 damage in a big arc.
7121880	7125760	That's if I just touch people or it shoots it out like a flamethrower.
7125760	7127760	AOE is Age of Empires.
7127760	7131640	All right. So area of the fact where it's it's it's after 10 o'clock.
7131640	7134520	So we were at the door right now. You're healed up.
7134520	7139680	We're ready to go in there and find diarrhea junior. Right. Mm hmm.
7141080	7142680	So you want to.
7145840	7148000	Carlos, that's diarrhea.
7151280	7153920	When you're running into first
7154680	7156920	and you feel something burst.
7158480	7160480	It's diarrhea.
7161360	7165600	When you're sliding in a second and your bowels begin to beckon.
7167600	7168640	That's diarrhea.
7168640	7172200	I tried to very quietly open the door. OK.
7174760	7176920	Sorry, I'm rolling dice on my phone.
7176920	7179040	That's what's happening when you're sliding in the third.
7180360	7184080	And you think you later turd.
7184240	7186440	That's diarrhea.
7186880	7190320	You creak open the door with with a slight noise, but
7190920	7193560	it seems to be being masked by the noise of farting.
7195000	7197520	What do we see? You see.
7198960	7204320	One of the guys is punching diarrhea, who's like on his side being tied up.
7204320	7205520	He's got a big black eye.
7205520	7209040	You see Patcheons who sprawled out, tied up on the opposite wall.
7209040	7212920	And you see two guys that are watching the one guy beat up Patcheons.
7213480	7218120	They're kind of you're you would be within eyeshot, but you're not noticed yet.
7218120	7219880	So it's like they're not looking right at you.
7219880	7222680	But they're kind of like in you're in their field of vision
7222680	7223640	if they were paying attention.
7223640	7227040	I turned to Carlos and I said, Carlos, it's time to.
7228440	7230240	Head for home.
7230840	7234520	And when you feel something foam.
7236680	7238240	That's diarrhea.
7239160	7241040	Cliffhanger.
7241040	7243280	Well, OK.
7243280	7245520	And we did it.
7245520	7248200	Give it up for Steve Levy, everybody.
7248200	7249200	Church.
7252720	7255000	Too many to mention Spencer Crittenden.
7256120	7257480	I'm your comptroller.
7257480	7259800	Jeff Davis, your mayor is Dan Harmon.
7260000	7260920	Thank you so much.
7260920	7262480	I'll play some more music for no reason.
7265320	7268040	It's the actor Kieber where you put a beat on before you get beat on.
7269920	7271320	Thank you.
7271320	7273640	Let's go to Harmon Town.
7273640	7275400	We opened up a door to Fart Town.
7278200	7297800	Did you get any of that?
7297800	7299240	It's a good show.
