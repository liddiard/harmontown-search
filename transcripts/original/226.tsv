0	28000	["Turn Your Station To Misery"]
28000	31000	From the ridiculously beautiful Sydney Opera House
31000	35000	and New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, Harmon Town
35000	37000	is now in session.
47000	50000	Please welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.
58000	66000	It's working now and I'm happy. How's everybody doing?
69000	70000	Yeah.
70000	73000	Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon!
88000	93000	Thank you.
93000	95000	So kind. You're so kind.
95000	100000	You know, Sydney is the kindest city in Australia. Did you know that?
100000	101000	Is that right?
101000	106000	It's the capital of the kindest state. We're in South Wales.
107000	108000	New South Wales?
108000	109000	Yes.
109000	110000	New South Wales.
110000	112000	This ain't your grandma's South Wales.
112000	117000	No. Fuck South Wales. That shit's in England somewhere.
118000	120000	It might be in Wales.
131000	134000	He looked at a map while I was in the hat store.
135000	138000	Is your mic loud enough? I had them turn mine up.
138000	142000	Mine has been, my volume's going, I don't know.
142000	143000	What about mine?
143000	144000	I don't know.
144000	145000	That's great.
145000	146000	A little louder for Dan's, right?
146000	147000	Yeah.
147000	149000	Let's get a little bit more Dan.
149000	152000	Check one, Sydney, Sydney, check two, Sydney.
152000	155000	You know what they call them? They call them Sydney-siders.
155000	156000	Did you know that?
156000	158000	They call what Sydney?
158000	159000	They call people from Sydney.
159000	160000	Sydney-siders?
160000	161000	Sydney-siders.
161000	163000	Oh, like on the side of Sydney.
164000	166000	Because I, what?
167000	172000	Now, let's talk about your new lid there, man. I like it a lot.
172000	175000	I like it a lot. Is that a proper acubra, whatever they call it?
175000	177000	This is an authentic acubra.
178000	181000	I got it in the store next to the hotel.
182000	189000	There were rabbits drying on the rack, and there were six of them that went into this one, so I know it's authentic.
190000	192000	Did they have boomerangs there?
192000	194000	Yeah, but they were mounted.
194000	195000	Oh.
195000	196000	So it's like, yeah.
196000	197000	You couldn't hurt people with them.
198000	207000	To put on your desk, like, the buck stops here, but then it goes away, and then it comes back again.
209000	213000	Yeah, so we're here at the Sydney Opera House, the historic Sydney Opera House.
213000	216000	I, you know, I do not feel bad about this.
216000	222000	I am very happy to be here, but I will say I was narcissistic and naive enough to believe when they said,
222000	227000	come to a show at the Sydney Opera House, I thought, I didn't know they had other rooms.
229000	230000	Yeah.
230000	232000	It makes perfect sense now.
233000	242000	And I love you guys. You're amazing. I'm not going to punish you, but I did fly out here with a different image in my head.
242000	245000	One that makes no sense. No sense.
245000	249000	The fact that not only could we fill the Sydney Opera House, but two nights.
249000	254000	Yeah, I know. They're like, you saw it. They want to do a second show at the Sydney. Really? Oh, bring it on.
254000	260000	I guess it's just cultural efficacy. Just they must be bored down there. I don't know.
261000	265000	Yeah, I'm not being aloof. I'm just looking at my notes.
265000	268000	Are those authentic crocodile teeth in the brim of that hat?
268000	276000	I don't know. They're teeth. I mean, I don't know, man. It's a $65 hat. That's all I know.
276000	280000	$65 Australian dollars. Are they dollars or are they called boomos?
280000	284000	Dollery. I think they're called dollery dudes. Yeah.
285000	289000	Yeah. So you were about to say a guy at the Melbourne show.
289000	294000	Because we start, we kicked off in Brisbane a couple of nights ago and shit went wild.
294000	300000	That crowd was raucous, to say the least. They were just fighting with each other. They were just booing each other.
300000	307000	They were having focus groups in the back? They were just saying like, oh, that was a good joke. What did you think of that joke?
307000	312000	It was okay. I don't know. Let's listen to the next joke. I don't know. I'd rather discuss this joke.
313000	315000	You're from Ipswich? Fuck you!
316000	321000	But they were awesome. I was more entertained by them than I think they were of us.
321000	326000	But then last night in Melbourne, it was a theatre, like a proper nice old theatre.
326000	334000	So it was less like a rock concert than the Brisbane show. But everybody had a thousand beers.
334000	338000	And there were two hecklers. One guy just kept yelling, bangarang from the back.
339000	346000	Which isn't even an Australian thing. It's a Spielberg thing. Bangarang. That's not Australian.
346000	351000	And then there was a guy up front. We were talking to a blind woman in the back and he was heckling her?
352000	356000	She wasn't blind, right? She was going to be blind in ten years.
356000	358000	But still, he took a pretty hard line on her.
359000	361000	He turned out to be right.
361000	366000	He's like, yeah, shut up to the blind lady. She wasn't blind.
367000	371000	So there was a guy, we ran into somebody after the show at a bar and he said,
371000	377000	because the bangarang guy up in the balcony, we were sitting behind him and he had a shoe off at one point.
378000	382000	He was waving his shoe and then they had washed him drink eleven beers.
382000	386000	And then he just looked at his shoe and then filled his shoe with vomit.
388000	392000	So now he's sitting there with a vomit filled shoe and then he realizes he has to go clean his shoe.
392000	394000	So he just pours the vomit out?
394000	400000	No, no, he went outside. He poured it on the sidewalk outside and then he proceeded to get in a fight.
401000	407000	And then we left and got food and then we came back and I saw the very vomit he poured out.
407000	412000	I didn't realize at the time that this was shoe man's vomit, but I pieced it together afterwards.
413000	415000	Was it on the sidewalk? I saw that too, yeah.
415000	420000	Yeah, and we were like, that's weirdly fresh vomit. That's why.
421000	423000	With little pieces of koala meat.
424000	426000	A little chlamydia.
427000	430000	That was a Sydney Siders vomit.
430000	434000	No, it was a Melbournian. I think he was from Ipswich.
437000	441000	But yeah, no, both great cities, both in their own different way.
441000	447000	Melbourne was like the hipster city and Brisbane was like Gremlins 2.
447000	458000	I think Brisbane is Sydney's Ipswich.
459000	463000	This is starting to make sense. I'm from the Midwestern United States.
463000	465000	Everybody always has to have a community.
465000	469000	When you're from Milwaukee, you have to pick on Cudahay.
470000	475000	It's just like a town of 200 people where all the tanning factories are.
475000	478000	So it smells like poop when you drive past it.
478000	482000	People in Milwaukee love picking on Cudahay because it's like shit rolls downhill.
482000	488000	But Sydney is the multicultural capital of, you know, even the world, let alone Australia.
488000	491000	This is the first European settlement.
491000	495000	This is where they first opened the prison colony for business.
495000	497000	They were like, this is the place, let's send them.
497000	502000	And then in the 19th century, they said, okay, you're not prisoners anymore.
502000	504000	Now you can try to build a society.
504000	509000	And the Aborigines were like, what about us for 30,000 years?
509000	512000	And then the beds are burning video.
513000	515000	And then everything's fine. Everything's fine now.
515000	516000	Wow.
516000	518000	Oh, well, you don't die.
518000	520000	Oh, I want it.
520000	522000	Oh, I want it.
522000	529000	Oh, you're my knight in shining armor, you old poop.
530000	533000	I always thought that guy sounded a lot like Katherine Hepburn.
534000	540000	How can we sleep when our golden pond is burning, you old poop?
541000	544000	You had them with Gremlins too, you lost them with our golden pond.
544000	547000	No, but not with all the Hepburn fans here, huh?
548000	550000	Maybe that's why you liked that song so much.
550000	552000	Like they were like, this sounds really original.
552000	557000	I'm like, that's bringing up baby.
559000	561000	Yeah, no, but it's beautiful here.
561000	563000	It's beautiful Melbourne, but beautiful here.
563000	565000	We're actually going to be here for a little while.
565000	568000	We're extending our vacation, and I'm off to Fiji.
568000	577000	But when we landed in the airplane, we went from the airplane to the baggage claim.
577000	581000	We got into the shuttle, and the first thing Spencer said,
581000	586000	having taken in that much of Australia, was, hot Canada.
590000	593000	In a good way, just to be clear, in a good way.
594000	596000	And I think there might have been a little pejorative,
596000	599000	I think it was just at that point, it was like, okay, it's hot.
599000	603000	Also, yeah, I mean, we've flown over and landed in much drier areas,
603000	606000	but that area specifically was very green, very hilly,
606000	608000	very much like Canada in the summer, it was great.
608000	611000	Also, the architecture to me is very reminiscent of Canada,
611000	616000	in that it's just very interesting, and I don't know,
616000	618000	all the buildings look the same in LA.
618000	621000	This is only the second country you've ever visited outside of the States,
621000	624000	so if you went to Thailand, you'd just go, Asian Canada.
624000	630000	It's like, no, if I go to Thailand, I'm like, it's like hot Australia.
632000	635000	And then I'll go to China, I'll be like, it's like big Thailand.
637000	641000	It's like, Russia's like cold China.
642000	645000	That's all, it's just the last place I've been to.
646000	649000	There are 250 languages spoken here,
649000	654000	which I'm sure is the case for any city above a certain level of population.
654000	656000	There's like five million people living here.
656000	659000	250 languages, come on, some of those are fake.
660000	663000	Are there even 200? That's like, there's a lot.
663000	667000	India's got like 49 of them, don't they?
670000	674000	I guess that's true, yeah, you get into these much ancient countries
674000	676000	and they have like 25,000 languages.
676000	678000	Yeah, you're right, you're right.
678000	680000	People are weird.
681000	684000	I get into town, I open up the first paragraph of Wikipedia
684000	689000	and I buy a hat and I'm just, I'm gold, you guys are very supportive.
689000	691000	You should be booing by now, for sure.
691000	696000	God knows, in Brisbane, a bowling ball would have been a shot at me.
697000	700000	I used to, I told them in Melbourne, I'll tell you,
700000	706000	if you ever see me announce a game of audience sound effects,
707000	709000	I'm in Brisbane.
710000	712000	Again, it's not their fault.
712000	714000	It was my fault, like the energy I put into the room
714000	716000	and they were just wonderful people.
719000	721000	Were you obsessed about their language for a long time?
721000	723000	I did, I was doing the whole accent thing.
723000	727000	Oh, la-di-da, Dan's gonna do the fucking accent humor.
727000	729000	To me, it wasn't like punching down.
729000	732000	I was trying to learn, because your accent is very, very difficult.
732000	736000	From a dialectic standpoint, it's hard to imitate.
737000	739000	But I came up with the phrase that I...
740000	744000	Let's chart your progress and see if you're getting better.
744000	748000	The phrase that I've landed on, and again, I know this isn't how you talk.
749000	752000	This is the sentence that I say.
752000	756000	My note going into this is Dan, it's a little too tense.
756000	758000	Yeah, because I'm thinking too hard about each word,
758000	761000	but if I don't think about each word, I'll just sound like a chimney sweep.
762000	765000	You know, if an American tries to do Australian, it's just like,
765000	769000	he's gonna go right into Dick Van Dyke and Mary Poppins.
770000	772000	But there's nuance to it.
772000	775000	It's a playful, wonderful dialect, and it's out.
775000	778000	So I've been trying to learn it, because I want to be able to do it.
778000	781000	So I arrived at this phrase, okay.
781000	782000	Oh, okay.
786000	789000	I like that hat, mate!
794000	795000	Don't encourage me.
795000	799000	I think they're just applauding the payoff.
799000	803000	They're not saying, oh, I brought you, I think he's going.
804000	808000	No one in Australia is ever that upset about anything.
808000	811000	At least of all a guy who likes that hat, mate.
811000	814000	But it's just me trying to, I'm like, each word, I'm like,
814000	817000	I like that hat, mate!
818000	820000	So angry.
820000	821000	He's not angry, though.
821000	822000	You're passing a stone.
822000	824000	Well, remember the guy in the Energizer commercials?
824000	825000	Oi!
825000	826000	Jackie, what was his name?
826000	827000	Jaco.
827000	828000	I'm dating myself.
828000	829000	Jaco.
829000	830000	All right.
830000	831000	All right.
831000	832000	Moving on.
832000	833000	Moving on.
833000	834000	We're all human beings.
835000	837000	Is that one of your notes?
837000	838000	Yeah, no.
839000	841000	Daily reminder.
841000	842000	All right.
842000	844000	So I want to ask you, okay.
844000	847000	So those hotel safes, do those even work?
847000	849000	Like, I mean, they're fun for us.
849000	852000	Like, we like the idea that we're locking something in those safes.
852000	857000	But if you're the kind of person that finds themselves in a hotel room
857000	860000	that doesn't belong to you, which rules out most of us.
860000	862000	Like, there's no cat burglars in this room.
863000	866000	Or inside job hotel larcenists, you know.
866000	870000	Like, those people know how to crack one of those fucking safes.
870000	874000	Yeah, because if you forget your code, somebody there knows how to get into that safe.
874000	879000	Yeah, and also there's YouTube videos of a guy cracking those safes.
879000	884000	And there's also a YouTube video of a spider dragging a mouse up the side of a refrigerator.
886000	888000	But we're not going to talk about that.
889000	891000	I'm going to pretend we're in a safe place, even though I'm covered.
891000	893000	I'm riddled with bites already.
893000	895000	I know something got me.
895000	896000	It was a huntsman.
896000	898000	I know a huntsman was on me.
899000	900000	This place is scary.
900000	904000	There's these people that come up, like, behind you at the supermarket,
904000	907000	and like, if you type in your, like, if you're paying with a credit card
907000	909000	or a debit card, you type in your code,
909000	913000	there's people that have a heat sensing, like, app on their phone
913000	915000	or a little add-on to their camera phone.
915000	918000	And it reads the numbers because you can still see the heat signature
918000	919000	from the ones that you pushed.
919000	920000	Oh, geez.
920000	923000	I thought you were talking about spider detectors or something.
923000	925000	I thought you were saying, like, just people in Australia,
925000	927000	this is how bad the spider problem is.
927000	928000	They have an app for that.
928000	931000	Like, you can see spider tracks across your dashboard.
932000	933000	Yeah.
933000	936000	But we were in, we were, anyways, we were,
936000	939000	I think we were in Brisbane and I was headlong into my spider anxieties
939000	943000	and someone said, there hasn't been a spider-related death in Australia in 30 years.
943000	947000	And I was like, you know, a normal continent wouldn't have to say that.
949000	952000	No one says that in North America. No one says that.
952000	954000	And we shoot each other every day.
954000	955000	I was reading the...
955000	959000	There hasn't been a mass shooting in the United States in three weeks.
960000	961000	I was reading the...
961000	963000	Mass meaning more than eight.
965000	968000	Look, I mean, yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying.
968000	972000	When the arithmetic comes in, you're hiding something.
974000	977000	I'm saying, like, there's been gerrymandering or something going on
977000	980000	as you guys redefined spider-related death.
980000	983000	That's all I'm saying. I'm not accusing you of anything.
983000	986000	I just know I see these videos, there's a lot of spiders down here,
986000	989000	and it's the ones you can't see that kill you.
990000	996000	You have ones the size of apes that can just put you to sleep for an afternoon.
997000	1003000	And they'll go in your kitchen and make mango humos, whatever they...
1004000	1006000	They'll make a flat white spider.
1006000	1010000	I'll go in and make a delicious flat white, which I love.
1010000	1013000	Because cappuccino, the only reason I never order cappuccinos
1013000	1016000	is because all that goddamn foam, you guys are geniuses. Thank you.
1017000	1018000	Flat white.
1018000	1021000	It's catching on back in the States, the flat white.
1021000	1022000	I'd never heard of it until this trip.
1022000	1026000	Me too, but then Cody said, by the way, also, it's catching on back in the States.
1029000	1035000	I can't wait to get back home and have a flat white and taste all of it
1035000	1039000	because part of my brain won't be vigilant against spider attack.
1041000	1045000	What do they do? Is this a coffee and they put milk on top of it?
1045000	1049000	It's like a cappuccino, but I don't know, they put foam reductor in it or something.
1050000	1053000	They put snake venom or something in it that makes the foam go down.
1053000	1055000	So it's not like a big pile of foam.
1055000	1058000	Like a cappuccino is so good, but then it's like this big...
1058000	1060000	It's like a baby taking a bath, you know?
1060000	1062000	There's like a big cone of foam on it.
1062000	1064000	Like, who are you trying to impress? This isn't liquid.
1064000	1066000	What am I supposed to do with it? It gets all over your face.
1066000	1068000	It's like a novelty drink, a cappuccino.
1069000	1071000	They figured it out. They took the nonsense out.
1071000	1072000	Oi!
1072000	1073000	Oi!
1076000	1080000	It's a... It's a flit... It's a flit-woy!
1081000	1083000	A flit-woy!
1084000	1086000	According to my dialect chart...
1086000	1088000	The I is an A.
1090000	1091000	The oi is an I.
1091000	1093000	Okay, alright. So...
1093000	1094000	Alright, so...
1094000	1098000	Now, you know, I don't think you're going to find probably anywhere you go.
1098000	1100000	Every time we go outside the United States,
1100000	1102000	be it to Canada or here...
1108000	1110000	Sometimes the food is wonderful.
1110000	1112000	Sometimes the food is bad.
1112000	1113000	Doesn't really matter.
1113000	1114000	It varies from city to city.
1114000	1116000	But everywhere outside the United States,
1116000	1118000	by virtue of...
1118000	1122000	Or by want of the kind of like particular, I think, capitalist,
1122000	1126000	fascistic frenzy that we have there,
1126000	1131000	where it's like you are never more than a corned beef hash order
1131000	1135000	served properly away from prison time.
1135000	1139000	Like America takes its capitalism very seriously.
1139000	1141000	So it's food service industry.
1141000	1144000	Again, it's hit and miss in terms of the quality of the food,
1144000	1148000	but you better believe the people making the food and bringing it to your table.
1148000	1151000	They have a little hustle in their bustle that you don't find when you leave the States.
1151000	1154000	No, Canada, you can go into a restaurant and die of hunger
1154000	1156000	because they're not coming.
1156000	1158000	There's just no urgency at all.
1158000	1162000	And I've had some really, really good food here,
1162000	1165000	but yeah, by and large, it's kind of like,
1165000	1169000	yeah, thanks for coming into this place where we're making food sometimes.
1169000	1172000	Sometimes you're kind of waiting.
1172000	1174000	I went to this place...
1174000	1175000	Well, whatever.
1175000	1176000	I don't want to...
1176000	1179000	Look, this is not me complaining.
1179000	1181000	It is me complaining.
1181000	1183000	Well, it's not the place.
1183000	1185000	It's just the restaurant, right?
1185000	1188000	Well, the place that we ate just before we came here was fucking...
1188000	1189000	Yeah, it's not Australia's fault.
1189000	1190000	It's Rockpool's fault.
1190000	1192000	Has anybody been to the Rock and Pool?
1192000	1193000	Rock Pool.
1193000	1194000	Rock Pool?
1194000	1196000	Rock Pool Bar and Grill House.
1196000	1202000	It was like if the little rascals tried to build an eyes-wide shut...
1202000	1204000	And all they had was the materials.
1204000	1209000	They just had all the black onyx, the formica and the crystal.
1209000	1213000	And none of the acumen?
1213000	1219000	It's this weird, multi-tiered, labyrinthine Lego village where...
1219000	1221000	It's really strange.
1221000	1225000	And all of the wait staff, they...
1225000	1226000	Nobody...
1226000	1229000	Who expects a wait person to...
1229000	1234000	The whole experience to me was like being pulled over by a cop.
1234000	1238000	My headspace was exactly that stressed and angry.
1238000	1240000	But part of it felt like we were the cops.
1240000	1244000	We caught them having a restaurant.
1244000	1246000	And they were like flummoxed.
1246000	1247000	They were high.
1247000	1249000	They found us out.
1249000	1250000	They're coming for our drugs.
1250000	1252000	We've got to make this look right.
1252000	1253000	We're a restaurant.
1253000	1255000	Because we were trying to find out how to get into it.
1255000	1257000	Because they have a thing here, Jeff.
1257000	1259000	We have handicap access.
1259000	1262000	You put a ramp or something in America.
1262000	1265000	Big grudgingly like, put a ramp.
1265000	1266000	Fine.
1266000	1267000	Give me my subsidy.
1268000	1270000	Here they're much more progressive.
1270000	1272000	But it's a little confusing.
1272000	1274000	We walk up to the restaurant.
1274000	1279000	And it says, disabled access only.
1279000	1282000	And we just paused in our tracks.
1282000	1283000	And we're looking at a restaurant.
1283000	1285000	And the people are cleaning glasses.
1285000	1287000	They're just looking at us.
1287000	1289000	And it says, just only.
1289000	1291000	And we're like, we just froze.
1291000	1293000	And we're like, own only?
1293000	1294000	Yeah.
1295000	1298000	So you can't take, that would be like using a handicap stall
1298000	1300000	to go in the door that's right in front of us.
1300000	1301000	Yeah, I don't think.
1301000	1303000	And the person's just watching us.
1303000	1304000	Cleaning the glass.
1304000	1306000	And then we finally just like start walking away.
1306000	1307000	We're looking at him.
1307000	1309000	We're waiting for him to go like, no, no, no.
1309000	1313000	That's just a kind of a formality, like the only part.
1313000	1314000	But I think it's serious.
1314000	1317000	But it was like, that was the only way to get into this place.
1317000	1318000	Then we went on this ramp.
1318000	1321000	That entrance had a sign for the place.
1321000	1324000	But the proper entrance didn't really have the signage.
1324000	1327000	So we saw what was the actual entrance.
1327000	1328000	And we figured out it was the entrance
1328000	1330000	because it was 20 stairs.
1330000	1334000	That was the only clue that this was the same building
1334000	1336000	we were trying to enter.
1336000	1339000	I'm going to just show the video I took of the, like that.
1342000	1343000	I'm not sure what to do with this.
1347000	1349000	So you did some photojournalism here?
1349000	1350000	You've got to set this up.
1350000	1351000	Videography?
1351000	1355000	On the drinks menu, they had a set of rules
1355000	1357000	that I posted on Instagram.
1357000	1359000	And we were going back and forth on whether or not
1359000	1361000	the rules were like a joke or serious.
1361000	1362000	But either way, it's fucked.
1362000	1365000	Because if they were serious, they're bullying me.
1365000	1369000	And if they're joking, they're bullying me.
1369000	1372000	Except then you have to divine that they're not actually
1372000	1373000	bullying me.
1373000	1374000	They're just bullying me.
1374000	1376000	What were some of the rules?
1376000	1379000	Don't look at anyone fiercely.
1379000	1382000	Yeah, don't join a conversation.
1382000	1384000	That's your bread and butter, though, man.
1384000	1387000	No, that's all I do.
1387000	1389000	Speaking of your physical appearance,
1389000	1391000	did your hair get more awesome today?
1391000	1393000	Like, it's really...
1393000	1396000	Thank you, thank you.
1396000	1397000	No.
1397000	1399000	Your hair is like a velvet cascade.
1399000	1400000	It's down, baby.
1400000	1401000	It's usually up.
1401000	1402000	Yeah.
1402000	1403000	It's glorious.
1403000	1405000	You're not going to go straight up
1405000	1407000	Melbourne topknot on me, are you?
1407000	1408000	Oh, no.
1408000	1410000	A lot of topknots here, people.
1410000	1411000	A lot of topknots.
1411000	1412000	No, there's topknots everywhere.
1412000	1413000	They're just fashionable.
1413000	1414000	I think Australia's leading the league.
1414000	1415000	I don't know, man.
1415000	1417000	Fucking LA is topknot city and I hate it.
1417000	1422000	I just want to drive over all those people.
1422000	1424000	Do we have any topknots in the house?
1424000	1425000	No topknots?
1425000	1427000	Oh, and then the lady...
1427000	1429000	The lady was giving me water.
1429000	1430000	They were giving me...
1430000	1432000	At this point, I was really agitated.
1432000	1433000	Like, I was...
1433000	1435000	Like I said, it was like being pulled over.
1435000	1438000	Like, my heart was racing and my skin was vibrating.
1438000	1441000	And she kept refilling my water.
1441000	1444000	And she came around one more time to refill my water.
1444000	1446000	And I was like, no, no, I'm good.
1446000	1447000	And she didn't say anything.
1447000	1450000	And she just poured me the water.
1450000	1453000	And as she was walking away, she was like, just in case.
1453000	1454000	And I was like, I'm out.
1454000	1456000	And I walked out.
1456000	1458000	Spencer just boned out, yeah.
1458000	1460000	Because she refilled my water.
1460000	1461000	Deal breaker.
1461000	1463000	Yeah, well, again, I told her not to.
1463000	1464000	And she did.
1464000	1465000	She was bullying me.
1465000	1466000	Yeah, you created...
1466000	1469000	You want to create some sort of social contract with these people.
1469000	1472000	And they're going to violate the simple things.
1472000	1473000	Yeah, I was doing it right.
1473000	1474000	I wasn't looking at anyone fiercely.
1474000	1477000	I wasn't joining a single conversation.
1477000	1481000	Okay, so I went to go to the bathroom in this place.
1481000	1485000	And then when I came back from the bathroom, I then...
1485000	1489000	Because I was like, I can't believe what I just walked through.
1489000	1491000	So I came back and then I took my...
1491000	1492000	That's why I shot in Portford mode.
1492000	1495000	I'm not an amateur.
1495000	1496000	But I...
1496000	1499000	So I recreated the bathroom walk.
1499000	1501000	But I don't know if this will translate or not.
1501000	1509000	But this is what you go through to get to the bathroom in this place.
1509000	1517000	I'm going to go to the bathroom.
1517000	1519000	So you walk around.
1519000	1520000	There's this whole big restaurant.
1520000	1522000	But you got to go around this corner.
1522000	1525000	And then there's this really narrow staircase.
1525000	1527000	And it's already weird.
1527000	1529000	Like you're going to an attic.
1529000	1530000	And there's a landing.
1530000	1532000	And then you turn.
1532000	1535000	And then there's another narrow staircase.
1535000	1539000	And at this point, you're thinking, okay, the bathroom's coming, right?
1539000	1542000	No, this is where the wedding area is.
1542000	1545000	There's a wedding going on.
1546000	1548000	It's like the shining.
1548000	1553000	You're just going to see a guy blowing a lion.
1553000	1556000	Or that might just be bathroom purgatory.
1556000	1558000	People have never found a bathroom.
1558000	1561000	Yeah, they just fell in love and got married.
1561000	1563000	So then you go past this.
1563000	1564000	What is this?
1564000	1565000	This is a kitchen?
1565000	1566000	Why am I in the...
1566000	1569000	There's a stove here.
1569000	1573000	But there's two guys doing their taxes on it.
1573000	1574000	These aren't chefs.
1575000	1577000	These are like bodyguards or something.
1577000	1578000	Odd job.
1578000	1582000	And like Dwayne The Rock Johnson are doing their taxes on an oven.
1582000	1586000	In the middle of a carpeted vestibule next to a wedding.
1586000	1588000	Up two flights of narrow stairs.
1588000	1590000	And still no bathroom.
1590000	1592000	But they're like in a hotel corridor here, right?
1592000	1593000	And it's carpeted?
1593000	1594000	Yeah.
1594000	1595000	And so, okay.
1595000	1596000	So then you keep going.
1596000	1597000	And I'm getting scared.
1597000	1600000	So MF, I think that's bathroom, male, female.
1600000	1601000	I don't know if that's an Australian thing.
1601000	1602000	I'm like, okay.
1602000	1603000	So you keep following the MF.
1603000	1605000	But what is this area?
1605000	1606000	Okay.
1606000	1608000	Services?
1608000	1610000	But it's blocked with a...
1610000	1613000	It's blocked with a couch?
1613000	1617000	Is something trying to get out of there?
1617000	1618000	Like, what are the...
1618000	1619000	And is that...
1619000	1620000	Oh, okay.
1620000	1621000	That's a doorknob.
1621000	1622000	I'm overreacting.
1622000	1623000	I thought that was like a crucifix.
1623000	1625000	Okay.
1625000	1626000	But then I just run out.
1626000	1627000	What are the other doors?
1627000	1629000	Electrical cupboard.
1629000	1632000	And the old WIP hose reel.
1632000	1634000	They're still working on that one.
1634000	1636000	Yeah.
1636000	1639000	All right.
1639000	1642000	So then you go down this narrow hallway of...
1642000	1643000	These door...
1643000	1645000	I don't know if you can tell how narrow these doors are.
1645000	1647000	That's like a radio.
1647000	1649000	This is your second time doing this.
1649000	1650000	You know where you're going.
1650000	1652000	Well, I knew to point the camera at some stuff.
1652000	1654000	But I'm also terrified I'm going to get caught.
1654000	1657000	Because there's guys in dinner jackets keep walking by and looking at me.
1657000	1658000	But I don't know if you can see.
1658000	1660000	These doors, they're really narrow.
1660000	1662000	And they have these really high doorknobs.
1662000	1663000	And they don't...
1663000	1668000	They have like this weird purple glow coming out.
1668000	1672000	It's like the minority report virtual sex dungeon.
1672000	1678000	Like there's a guy behind each door like engaged in a different fantasy.
1678000	1681000	This guy just came out of like one weird bathroom.
1681000	1683000	That was the handicap one.
1683000	1684000	Is that Chris Hardwick?
1684000	1685000	Yes.
1685000	1687000	And then it says toilet.
1687000	1689000	And then you got your M and your F.
1689000	1693000	And I finally, you know, finally...
1693000	1695000	Yeah, thank you, sir.
1695000	1698000	Not that I see the world through that lens, but...
1703000	1704000	Oh, no.
1704000	1705000	Please.
1705000	1707000	Jesus Christ.
1708000	1709000	Go ahead.
1717000	1720000	Will that translate to our audio podcast listeners?
1720000	1723000	No, but these people paid good money for a show.
1723000	1727000	Can you upload a link to that on your Yelp review of this place?
1730000	1734000	You better kind of just kind of have to pee when you start that process.
1734000	1735000	Yeah, man.
1735000	1736000	Yeah.
1738000	1740000	But the food was great.
1740000	1741000	It was...
1741000	1744000	Cody said her prawn was good, but then halfway through the meal,
1744000	1745000	she said she started...
1745000	1749000	She was seeing a cloud that wouldn't go away.
1749000	1751000	I don't think that's this restaurant's fault.
1751000	1752000	It was before we...
1752000	1754000	When we were ordering, she started to see this thing.
1754000	1755000	I'm really concerned about her.
1755000	1757000	She's back at the hotel.
1759000	1761000	What are we going to do without my bean?
1762000	1764000	Yeah, thanks, guys.
1764000	1766000	I didn't cancel the show or anything.
1767000	1769000	I told Steve to check in on her halfway,
1769000	1772000	but I got her permission to tell this story.
1772000	1773000	We got...
1773000	1775000	I mean, obviously, we got to the hotel,
1775000	1779000	and then I guess there was some maybe screw-up or something.
1779000	1780000	I don't know.
1780000	1781000	I don't think...
1781000	1785000	I'm not going to throw shade on the hotel, as the kids would say.
1785000	1787000	I don't know what they did wrong or didn't do wrong.
1787000	1789000	I just sat in the lobby and played cookie collector
1789000	1791000	until someone handed me the hotel key.
1791000	1792000	We went up to the room.
1792000	1794000	The room was small, but whatever.
1794000	1795000	It's a hotel.
1795000	1799000	But then, I guess, our very intrepid, very...
1799000	1803000	She's the civilized Crocodile Dundee
1803000	1804000	to our...
1804000	1807000	What's her name from Crocodile Dundee?
1807000	1809000	She's our Australian guide.
1809000	1811000	She's our point person.
1811000	1813000	Alice has been taken very good care of.
1813000	1814000	She's our wrangler.
1814000	1816000	And every time there's a problem, you get to say,
1816000	1818000	go ask Alice for something like that.
1818000	1821000	When she was just a small...
1821000	1822000	But she...
1822000	1825000	I guess she did some wrangling at that desk
1825000	1829000	and maybe between that and the niceness of the Australian people in general.
1829000	1831000	They upgraded our rooms.
1831000	1832000	So we got...
1832000	1834000	The guy came to our door, gave us keys, me and Cody.
1834000	1836000	We went up to a different room.
1836000	1838000	It was a fucking penthouse.
1838000	1839000	It was crazy.
1839000	1841000	There was a board room in our room.
1841000	1844000	There's a room and then there's like two bathrooms
1844000	1847000	and there's a bedroom and then there's like a hallway.
1847000	1850000	Is there a door mark WIP hose reel?
1850000	1852000	There's a hose reel in there?
1852000	1856000	That's a portal straight to Rockpool Restaurant.
1856000	1859000	Let's not gloss over this conference room, this board room.
1859000	1862000	It had a conference table with how many chairs?
1862000	1863000	It's more than eight.
1863000	1865000	I think it seems like a ten person...
1865000	1867000	Like a literal conference room.
1867000	1869000	It was made for board meetings, yeah.
1869000	1872000	And then the first thing we thought when we looked at it is,
1872000	1875000	we gotta fuck on this.
1875000	1878000	We gotta do some kind of sexual role play.
1879000	1881000	Because usually when we do that...
1881000	1884000	I want that report on my giant desk.
1885000	1886000	We usually have to...
1886000	1888000	When we do our little role playing scenarios,
1888000	1890000	that's what Cody and I are into.
1890000	1891000	Again, I got her permission.
1891000	1894000	If she's dying tonight and she don't feel bad for her,
1894000	1898000	she did give me permission to talk about her sex life before.
1898000	1901000	Real quick, when they travel, we'll be somewhere on the road
1901000	1903000	and we'll be getting into the hotel.
1903000	1906000	Or we'll be out having lunch or whatever, go back to the hotel.
1906000	1908000	And they're like, okay, no, there'll be beans on.
1908000	1909000	I'll be down at the bar.
1909000	1911000	You can go up there and I'll be up in five minutes.
1911000	1914000	I'm like, are you taking a lobby shit?
1914000	1915000	So she can have things.
1915000	1918000	It's like, no, she has to get in costume.
1918000	1921000	You know, like, well, sometimes that's...
1921000	1922000	But you guys go out shopping.
1922000	1924000	You go out in little costume shopping space.
1924000	1926000	We go to Amazon, you know.
1926000	1928000	We order stuff on Amazon.
1928000	1931000	I want to go to pitch meetings at Amazon because they make TV.
1931000	1933000	I'm always walking out of there going like...
1933000	1935000	Did they say no to that TV idea?
1935000	1937000	Because it's a bad TV idea?
1937000	1941000	Or because they know I'm a fucking weird sex fiend
1941000	1945000	who always orders way too much toilet paper
1945000	1949000	and like just pantyhose in bulk.
1949000	1951000	Anyways, the...
1951000	1952000	But we did...
1952000	1954000	Yeah, so I was like, let's do a little role play
1954000	1956000	with using the boardroom environment
1956000	1958000	because we're not going to have this ever again.
1958000	1960000	But it got really confusing because I tried...
1960000	1962000	I thought I could improvise my way through this
1962000	1967000	where I was like, I was a human resources guy.
1967000	1968000	But I was...
1968000	1970000	I bet you were.
1970000	1974000	I was investigating her because someone had filed a complaint
1974000	1978000	that she was dressed too provocatively at work.
1978000	1981000	And then she's like, well, this is how I dress all the time.
1981000	1982000	What's wrong with this?
1982000	1986000	And I was like, well, a lot of times what happens is
1986000	1988000	guys at the office, if they get aroused,
1989000	1996000	they'll try to get revenge by filing a complaint.
1996000	2000000	And I'm sorry, it's their word against yours unless...
2004000	2005000	It was getting really...
2005000	2006000	Because she's trying to like, yes, yeah.
2006000	2009000	But she's like, where are you going with this?
2009000	2012000	And she's like, is this about...
2012000	2014000	Is this about...
2014000	2015000	What did she say?
2015000	2017000	Jason Ortega?
2018000	2021000	Jason Ortega, no, this does nothing to do with Jason Ortega.
2021000	2022000	No, he...
2022000	2027000	All I can tell you is that multiple people have filed complaints
2027000	2029000	about your provocative clothing.
2029000	2031000	And then I was just like...
2031000	2036000	She was yes-anding you, but you absolutely knowed her.
2036000	2039000	Yeah, well, I was like, Jason Ortega may or may not be a part of this.
2039000	2040000	Okay, fair enough.
2040000	2042000	Because I was trying to figure out, I was like,
2042000	2044000	how did you think that you could jump into this pool
2044000	2046000	and find your way to any edge that had to do with having sex
2046000	2048000	before we have to go to dinner?
2048000	2051000	And so the way I got through it was I was like,
2051000	2060000	look, there's exceptions we can make if I can prove that...
2060000	2062000	My dick fits in your pussy.
2063000	2067000	If I can prove that it's just you as an individual
2067000	2071000	that is arousing and not your outfits...
2072000	2075000	Then I can take your side...
2075000	2078000	I'm hard as a fucking diamond right now.
2078000	2083000	And I'm like, the whole time we're having sex,
2083000	2087000	I'm like, justifying, I'm like, yeah, see, this isn't your fault.
2087000	2090000	You were born this way.
2090000	2095000	I mean, yeah, the outfit's great, but it's the way it's on you.
2095000	2098000	And wow, you're great at this.
2098000	2103000	And so I think I'm going to file a favorable report
2103000	2105000	with human resources.
2105000	2107000	All over you.
2109000	2113000	And maybe the last encounter she ever has with me
2113000	2116000	is a badly improvised sexual roleplay.
2116000	2119000	Don't reveal anything you don't want to reveal, obviously.
2119000	2124000	And don't get specific, but I know that you guys do this
2125000	2129000	fairly elaborate backstory roleplaying things.
2129000	2132000	So you are doing improv.
2132000	2134000	You're doing a little scene.
2134000	2137000	And how good are you guys at staying in character?
2137000	2139000	Really good, yeah.
2139000	2141000	That's the problem with Jason Ortega
2141000	2143000	or something that will throw somebody.
2143000	2145000	We don't want to break.
2145000	2147000	We don't tend to.
2147000	2149000	It's very immersive.
2149000	2152000	It was about Jason Ortega, and then you make up what he said.
2152000	2153000	No, I hate Jeff.
2153000	2155000	And you reenact.
2155000	2158000	You should be making love to my girlfriend.
2158000	2159000	It's easy.
2159000	2160000	What if right at that moment she goes,
2160000	2161000	is this about Jason Ortega?
2161000	2162000	And you're like, no.
2162000	2163000	Could it be?
2163000	2164000	It might not.
2164000	2165000	Could it be anybody?
2165000	2166000	And then knock, knock, knock.
2166000	2168000	And I'm there, and I have a Jason named Tanya.
2168000	2171000	You're dressed as a mariachi.
2171000	2172000	OK, all right.
2172000	2174000	Well, it's a little over the top,
2174000	2178000	but Jason Ortega's here.
2178000	2179000	Yeah.
2179000	2181000	That's an Ortega.
2181000	2182000	That's too specific.
2182000	2184000	That has to be a high school something.
2184000	2186000	That sounds like a famous person, right?
2186000	2189000	She explained afterward, because we like to go back over it
2189000	2190000	when we're done.
2190000	2196000	Like, well, I grab the towel, and then we're kind of like,
2196000	2199000	well, boy, back in Albuquerque.
2199000	2202000	I took a left, because I thought, no, you did.
2202000	2205000	But the first name off the top of her head,
2205000	2207000	she was afraid was going to upset me,
2207000	2210000	because it was somebody we had been talking about earlier.
2211000	2216000	So she had to really hang a hard left off of a more naturally
2216000	2219000	improvised name, because it was you.
2219000	2221000	No, I'm kidding.
2221000	2222000	But anyways, all right.
2222000	2226000	So look, no harm in town show abroad
2226000	2228000	would be complete without.
2228000	2231000	And then I just fart.
2231000	2235000	I believe the owner of the Sydney Opera House comes out,
2235000	2239000	and thanks you for coming.
2240000	2242000	Kevin Sidney.
2251000	2254000	Why was that joke that guy's favorite part of the show?
2254000	2257000	Kevin Sidney.
2257000	2260000	You really got that guy's number now.
2260000	2263000	I guess I'm kind of like, yeah, this is kind of funny
2263000	2265000	the more you think about it, because it's like,
2265000	2267000	it's called the Sydney Opera House.
2267000	2271000	In Sydney, yeah, OK.
2271000	2273000	That is kind of funny.
2273000	2274000	Well, thank you, sir.
2274000	2277000	I agree.
2277000	2281000	Well, let's get to know some of our friends
2281000	2285000	in this segment we do in Australia called Ask an Australian.
2288000	2296000	Except I was told if I go off stage that the cameras won't
2296000	2299000	be able to see me, so who cares?
2299000	2300000	You guys could see me.
2300000	2302000	We'll just be out here for a second.
2302000	2304000	We'll start in the front, because these guys must
2304000	2306000	have done something special.
2306000	2307000	Look at this guy.
2307000	2310000	I mean, come on.
2310000	2312000	Are you willing to come up on stage
2312000	2314000	if we promise we're not going to talk
2314000	2318000	about your really red hair?
2327000	2330000	Because I cannot make that promise.
2330000	2331000	How's it going?
2331000	2332000	Ryan?
2332000	2333000	Ryan, everybody.
2333000	2334000	Welcome, Ryan.
2339000	2341000	Ryan, I just learned from our friend Allie
2341000	2344000	in the front row, who also has brilliantly red hair,
2344000	2346000	that what's the word?
2346000	2348000	Rang-er.
2348000	2349000	Rang-er?
2349000	2350000	Rang-er?
2350000	2351000	Is that like a ginger?
2351000	2352000	Is that your word for ginger?
2352000	2356000	It comes from like orangutan.
2356000	2359000	We cup that a lot in Australia.
2359000	2362000	Is there a heavy redhead population in Australia?
2362000	2363000	Yes, with you.
2363000	2365000	We get around.
2365000	2367000	I guess there's more in Scotland than Ireland.
2367000	2368000	Is that true?
2368000	2369000	Anybody know that?
2369000	2370000	Yes.
2370000	2373000	Are you Scottish heritage?
2373000	2375000	Actually, I don't think so.
2375000	2376000	You adopted?
2376000	2377000	Maybe.
2377000	2380000	None of my brothers, none of my cousins, none of my aunts,
2381000	2383000	neither of my parents, none of my grandparents have red hair.
2383000	2384000	Really?
2384000	2387000	I just kind of appeared.
2387000	2388000	I like what's going on here.
2388000	2390000	It's very, like, it's very, like,
2390000	2392000	it's very, like, illustratively waved.
2392000	2393000	It's very nice.
2393000	2394000	It's very good.
2394000	2395000	Thank you.
2395000	2396000	I do my best.
2396000	2397000	I love it.
2397000	2398000	So, Ryan, are you a local?
2398000	2399000	Well, wait.
2399000	2401000	We have to verify his authenticity.
2401000	2403000	We have to put you through a legal procedure here.
2403000	2406000	I write little phrases for the Australian guests
2406000	2409000	to read to verify their Australian-ness.
2409000	2410000	Because if I said this,
2410000	2411000	I wouldn't sound Australian at all.
2411000	2412000	Can you read that?
2412000	2413000	It's at the top in boldface.
2413000	2415000	Right.
2415000	2418000	There's more spiders here than people,
2418000	2421000	and the ones you can't see are the ones that kill you.
2421000	2422000	Yeah, you sound pretty Australian.
2422000	2423000	Thank you.
2423000	2425000	All right.
2425000	2427000	That's the only one I had left, by the way.
2427000	2428000	We're going to write more or make them up.
2428000	2430000	I'll have to whisper to the next person.
2430000	2431000	Okay.
2431000	2432000	I'll be like...
2432000	2439000	Struth, that crocs a splasher.
2439000	2445000	That crocs a splasher.
2445000	2449000	That's what you guys say after you take a shit.
2449000	2452000	Struth, that crocs a splasher.
2452000	2456000	Someone should tame that thing.
2456000	2458000	Are you from here?
2458000	2461000	I'm originally from Lithgow in the Blue Mountains.
2461000	2462000	Lithgow.
2462000	2463000	Popular.
2463000	2466000	A few people apparently know Lithgow.
2466000	2468000	I'm living in Wollongong at the moment,
2468000	2469000	which is south a little bit.
2469000	2470000	Wollongong?
2470000	2471000	Wollongong.
2471000	2472000	Wollongong.
2472000	2473000	Yeah.
2473000	2474000	I'm going to university there.
2474000	2475000	I love it.
2475000	2476000	I spend a fair bit of time in Sydney.
2476000	2477000	My brother lives here, so...
2477000	2478000	What do you do for a living?
2478000	2481000	Up until recently, I was a science interpreter,
2481000	2483000	so teaching science to kids working at a planetarium.
2483000	2484000	Ooh.
2484000	2486000	Now, I'm currently not doing that.
2486000	2489000	I pulled out of that because I'm doing my Masters in teaching.
2489000	2490000	No.
2490000	2491000	Good for you.
2491000	2492000	All good news, right?
2492000	2495000	What do you want to teach?
2495000	2499000	I have a degree in history and one in English lit, so...
2499000	2500000	Either.
2500000	2501000	Either role.
2501000	2502000	Yep.
2502000	2503000	Okay, so as a history teacher...
2503000	2505000	Check out the brains on Ryan.
2505000	2508000	Can you verify for me that we are...
2508000	2512000	In the States, we are fucked.
2512000	2518000	We're, like, historically, like, fucking 1932 fucked.
2518000	2521000	I don't want to be an alarmist, but yeah.
2521000	2522000	I mean, we hacked at this point.
2522000	2524000	Like, everybody in the Internet is always like,
2524000	2528000	oh, you know, compare it to Hitler.
2528000	2530000	It's like, like, I don't care, man.
2530000	2533000	I don't care about a party foul if somebody's so much like Hitler
2533000	2535000	that I really...
2535000	2537000	I would really love to be wrong.
2537000	2538000	I'm fine with that.
2538000	2543000	But if I'm right, I think it's important to be right earlier than later.
2543000	2547000	I think that maybe people should have compared Hitler to Hitler sooner.
2547000	2548000	Yeah.
2548000	2550000	I know exactly what you mean.
2550000	2553000	And I think most Australians will agree with me when I say it.
2553000	2556000	It was kind of hilarious for a little while while it was happening.
2556000	2557000	Like Hitler?
2557000	2558000	Yeah.
2558000	2559000	Like Hitler.
2559000	2561000	Because he literally looked like Charlie Chaplin.
2561000	2562000	Okay.
2562000	2564000	People are like, you're hilarious.
2564000	2566000	But come on, you can't talk like that.
2566000	2567000	You're going to jail.
2567000	2568000	And he's like, I'm going to write a dumb book.
2568000	2571000	And I was like, this dumb book is great, said the morons.
2571000	2573000	And everything was, like, perfect parallel.
2573000	2574000	Yeah.
2574000	2577000	And then the first thing he did when he got elected,
2577000	2581000	not by a majority, but by the German Electoral College.
2585000	2587000	When he swept Michigan?
2587000	2588000	Yeah.
2588000	2595000	There's this patch of field right on the armpit of the Rhine
2595000	2599000	where everyone has 300 votes.
2600000	2601000	Anyways.
2602000	2604000	Harmon, save it for your therapist.
2608000	2610000	So where are you guys at?
2610000	2616000	Because there's so many strange, like, flippy floppies that happen.
2616000	2618000	I mean, like, in the human sense,
2618000	2622000	you can just tell a hip, progressive, liberal person
2622000	2626000	from a kind of more starchy, conservative person,
2626000	2627000	no matter where you go.
2627000	2629000	But everybody has different words for this stuff.
2629000	2631000	And also, it's not just semantics,
2631000	2634000	because depending on where you're at,
2634000	2637000	the progressives could be secessionists.
2637000	2639000	Or progressives could be, like, gun nuts.
2639000	2641000	Like, what's happening in the states right now is, like,
2641000	2644000	I feel like I want to buy a gun and dig a hole
2644000	2647000	and, like, wait for Trump to try to pry my gun out
2647000	2649000	of my cold, dead fingers.
2649000	2652000	I'm, like, a Constitution nut now.
2652000	2653000	Somebody's yelling something out.
2653000	2654000	Was it worth it?
2655000	2656000	Yeah.
2656000	2659000	Our conservative party is called the liberal.
2659000	2659000	
2659000	2661000	That's the first thing I found out, is it's careful,
2661000	2663000	because our liberals are Nazis.
2663000	2666000	They're like, what?
2666000	2667000	It's crazy.
2667000	2669000	But then you go, like, well, what does Republican mean?
2669000	2671000	Like, oh, these guys love republics so much.
2671000	2673000	And it's never really made any sense.
2673000	2674000	It's just anybody.
2674000	2677000	What I wanted to ask you is, like, can you, like,
2677000	2680000	and if you don't want to take the slings and arrows,
2680000	2682000	but if it's like a hot button and you're like,
2683000	2685000	I came up here to talk about my beautiful hair.
2685000	2686000	Like, I don't know what.
2686000	2687000	But you're a history teacher.
2687000	2689000	That sounds like you have the respect of the crowd.
2689000	2690000	Like, where are you?
2692000	2694000	Where are you?
2695000	2699000	Where is Australia at right now as this world is shifting
2699000	2703000	into what I would call a factors leading to chapter
2703000	2705000	in the history book?
2705000	2707000	It's nationalist revolution.
2707000	2709000	It's kind of hard to say, to be honest.
2709000	2711000	We're caught between...
2711000	2712000	Yeah.
2714000	2715000	We're fucked.
2715000	2716000	We're fucked.
2716000	2717000	We're fucked.
2717000	2718000	You're fucked, too?
2718000	2720000	Yeah, I think we're all kind of a little bit fucked.
2720000	2721000	Yeah.
2721000	2724000	That guy's just the subtitles of what's going on up here.
2726000	2728000	Our current prime minister's, like,
2728000	2732000	the most smug, rich guy you can possibly imagine.
2732000	2735000	He's maybe better than the last guy.
2735000	2736000	Maybe.
2736000	2737000	Is it Turnball, right?
2737000	2739000	Yeah, Turnball is our current PM.
2739000	2741000	And then Tiny Abbott...
2743000	2744000	Tiny Abbott?
2744000	2745000	Tony.
2748000	2751000	Is it more like Crocodile Dundee than I thought?
2751000	2754000	Like, our prime minister is Donk.
2754000	2757000	And then Tiny Abbots are our president.
2757000	2758000	No, okay.
2758000	2759000	Tony Abbott.
2759000	2762000	He was like a monumental piece of shit, but...
2765000	2768000	He didn't really have the wherewithal to hide it,
2768000	2771000	so everyone knew he was a piece of shit,
2771000	2774000	whereas Turnball kind of hides it a bit better,
2774000	2776000	so I feel like he's winning some people over
2776000	2778000	just because he's a bit more swammy and stuff.
2778000	2781000	So, yeah, he's probably a lot worse,
2781000	2784000	but he comes across as slightly more palatable,
2784000	2785000	which is worrying.
2785000	2788000	That's why I feel so fucked in the States,
2788000	2790000	is because it's not Donald Trump.
2790000	2792000	It's actually...
2792000	2794000	It's either centuries or millennia payback
2794000	2797000	of fixation on the hero worship, the principle,
2797000	2800000	or the idea that there's people that can make a difference,
2800000	2804000	as opposed to each individual has to really create their own world
2804000	2809000	and work practically toward a world that functions for all of us.
2809000	2811000	We all have this tendency to...
2811000	2813000	It just takes a big load off our shoulders
2813000	2815000	when we pick this favorite person to speak for us,
2815000	2817000	or that person's going to bring about stuff
2817000	2819000	so we can kind of do what we do best,
2819000	2821000	which is not much at all,
2821000	2824000	and that's just us being good orangutans.
2824000	2826000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2826000	2828000	Sorry.
2829000	2831000	Are you excited?
2835000	2837000	Did I hear that wrong,
2837000	2841000	or do Australians just yell out baking soda when they get excited?
2842000	2843000	That's his word.
2843000	2845000	Baking soda?
2846000	2850000	Your plastic submarine's going up and down.
2850000	2852000	Baking soda?
2855000	2857000	Baking soda?
2857000	2860000	Remove the odor from your fridge-y.
2863000	2865000	Baking soda?
2865000	2866000	No, what did he say?
2866000	2868000	I have no idea. What did you say?
2868000	2870000	He can say it.
2870000	2872000	Yeah, but Dan said it's my word.
2872000	2873000	You can say it.
2873000	2874000	It's my word.
2874000	2876000	Oh, he can say it, okay.
2876000	2877000	Sorry.
2877000	2879000	Yeah, it was funny.
2879000	2880000	That happens to me a lot too.
2880000	2882000	It's like, well, it's not funny now.
2883000	2885000	It was funny when I yelled it out,
2885000	2888000	and I didn't mumble it, so I don't deserve this.
2888000	2891000	I nailed it the first time.
2891000	2892000	They all laughed.
2892000	2895000	You got gum in your dumb Yankee ears.
2895000	2896000	Very good, sir.
2896000	2898000	Good job on that joke.
2898000	2901000	Dots connected culturally.
2901000	2903000	All right, so anyway.
2903000	2905000	All right, so what are you going to tell kids to do
2905000	2907000	as you're teaching them history,
2907000	2910000	and you're also thinking in your head,
2910000	2912000	I have no future to teach you,
2912000	2916000	because it's grow gills or drown.
2916000	2918000	Do you just hide that from them?
2918000	2919000	I don't know.
2919000	2921000	I'm a little bit optimistic, honestly.
2921000	2923000	The more I work with kids,
2923000	2925000	the more I have faith in the future.
2930000	2931000	It's honestly true.
2931000	2933000	It's like when you meet a baby boomer,
2933000	2935000	that's when the red flags start popping up in my head.
2935000	2936000	Yeah, or a millennial.
2936000	2938000	So maybe having a soul skips a generation.
2938000	2939000	Yeah.
2944000	2945000	That's what I keep thinking,
2945000	2947000	because I'm from a thing called Generation X.
2947000	2948000	I don't know what they have.
2948000	2949000	That's maybe just an American thing,
2949000	2951000	but it's like we're outnumbered 10 to 1 on both sides.
2951000	2953000	Our parents are these huge douchebags
2953000	2956000	that they had their own trivial pursuit edition,
2956000	2960000	and they invented the Beatles and the moon
2960000	2962000	and all this shit.
2962000	2964000	Everyone makes movies for them,
2964000	2966000	and they're just like jacked off to references
2966000	2967000	to their lifetime.
2967000	2968000	Like, what?
2968000	2969000	That's, what?
2969000	2971000	Chuck Willery?
2971000	2972000	Oh, I just can't.
2972000	2973000	Chuck Willery.
2975000	2977000	And then my generation was like,
2977000	2978000	I hate my parents.
2978000	2980000	That's enough for me.
2981000	2983000	But then we had kids,
2983000	2988000	and the people, they're like little baby boomers.
2988000	2989000	I always said that.
2989000	2990000	They love their parents,
2990000	2992000	and they love the president and teamwork.
2993000	2997000	And it just like, it started with like,
2997000	2999000	we're shiny star people.
2999000	3000000	We can use an iPad better.
3000000	3002000	And it was like, you're adorable,
3002000	3004000	but there's something fucking Orwellian about you.
3006000	3010000	And then they just hit their teenage years,
3010000	3012000	and I was like, I know we're one Orwellian dictator
3012000	3014000	from these kids in a jumpsuit.
3014000	3016000	They're gonna flip like a fucking Othello piece.
3017000	3022000	But anyway, why did I bring you up here
3022000	3023000	to just talk at you?
3023000	3024000	I've already said all this stuff.
3024000	3025000	Tell us the solution.
3025000	3027000	Tell us how to fix the world.
3029000	3030000	I'm gonna get a drink.
3030000	3031000	You want a drink?
3031000	3032000	I would love a drink.
3032000	3033000	Well, when I come back,
3033000	3034000	you better have a plan for the world.
3034000	3038000	The solution to everything is murder.
3038000	3041000	Getting a drink, probably.
3041000	3042000	Yeah.
3042000	3043000	Maybe it's murder?
3043000	3044000	No, yeah.
3044000	3045000	I know it's murder.
3047000	3049000	You can't do it.
3049000	3050000	That's the problem.
3050000	3052000	I'm touching your eyes.
3052000	3053000	I hope that's okay.
3053000	3056000	A friend of mine is dating some guy
3056000	3059000	down in Central America.
3059000	3062000	They're super hippy ecologist types.
3062000	3064000	They live in mud huts and whatnot.
3064000	3066000	And it's all about saving the planet,
3066000	3067000	which sounds amazing.
3067000	3069000	But then the more you find out about this guy
3069000	3071000	is that he's a complete psychopath.
3071000	3075000	And he's kind of like a low-level wannabe cult guy
3075000	3078000	where women that hang out with him,
3078000	3080000	you can't talk to your parents
3080000	3082000	and you can't talk to anybody that lives in a city
3082000	3083000	because that's all evil.
3083000	3085000	And you have to just live with me
3085000	3087000	and connect to nature.
3087000	3090000	And he starts running these people's lives.
3090000	3091000	And one of his solutions,
3091000	3094000	he really thinks that the way to save the planet
3094000	3095000	is just to start killing people.
3095000	3096000	Yeah, man.
3100000	3101000	That's what I'm saying.
3101000	3102000	Start with that guy, though.
3102000	3103000	Fuck him.
3105000	3115000	It's the world's shortest O. Henry novel.
3115000	3118000	Lead by example, motherfucker.
3118000	3121000	It's a two-minute Twilight Zone episode.
3121000	3124000	Time enough for genocide at last.
3124000	3127000	Wait, me?
3127000	3129000	I do have that like...
3129000	3130000	Wasn't it one of the two guys,
3130000	3132000	was it Watson or Crick,
3132000	3135000	the guys that discovered the shape of DNA?
3135000	3138000	One of them's like a cosmic DNA guy
3138000	3139000	that said like,
3139000	3141000	oh, DNA couldn't have evolved on Earth,
3141000	3143000	there's not enough time mathematically.
3143000	3144000	And I don't know if it's the same guy,
3144000	3146000	but there's another of the two
3146000	3148000	in an uncomfortable, cringy way,
3148000	3153000	has gone on record as saying that stupidity is a disease
3153000	3155000	and we should cure it with eugenics.
3155000	3158000	You know, like, oh, some people are just dumb.
3158000	3159000	They're just born dumb.
3159000	3161000	And that's like any other disability
3161000	3163000	and why don't we cull that from the population
3163000	3164000	if we're interested?
3164000	3167000	And it's like, oi, okay.
3167000	3172000	Oi in the Australian and the Yiddish.
3172000	3175000	Like neither of us want to go there.
3175000	3181000	But then in my country or my prison colony
3181000	3183000	where this recent thing happened,
3183000	3185000	it was like I just started feeling,
3185000	3187000	even before the election actually,
3187000	3188000	kind of went the way it did,
3189000	3191000	I started having this weird,
3191000	3193000	I was just like fuck stupid people.
3193000	3197000	I just don't, it's not like I graduated college
3197000	3199000	so by stupid I must mean something else.
3199000	3201000	Yeah, no, definitely fuck stupid people.
3201000	3204000	But should we just go to war with them?
3204000	3205000	No, but I mean, I don't know.
3205000	3208000	The thing is democracy makes us hate stupid people
3208000	3211000	because their stupidity counts as much as ours or more
3211000	3212000	because we live in California
3212000	3215000	and our vote counts less than someone who lives in Wyoming
3215000	3216000	and we're better than Wyoming
3216000	3218000	and Wyoming's full of idiots.
3218000	3220000	You hear that, Wyoming?
3220000	3222000	Yeah, go fuck yourself.
3222000	3225000	I used to tell people Wyoming didn't exist
3225000	3228000	and no one challenged me.
3228000	3230000	That's a true story.
3230000	3233000	My whole middle school was just lying to people
3233000	3235000	because, you know, as you could tell,
3235000	3237000	I'm an authoritative source that sounds like
3237000	3239000	I know what I'm talking about.
3239000	3242000	So it just, it all tracks, you know?
3242000	3244000	All right, as a teacher,
3244000	3245000	I'm glad that you're a good person, Spencer,
3245000	3247000	because you can be really terrified.
3247000	3249000	No, I know.
3249000	3252000	I'd probably be more effective if I just embraced the evil,
3252000	3254000	but, you know, I'm better than you.
3254000	3255000	That's what I think sometimes.
3255000	3257000	I think, like, let's just be super villains.
3257000	3258000	Right.
3258000	3259000	Let's create a bomb that kills all the dumb people.
3259000	3260000	Right, yeah.
3260000	3261000	Or just take everybody to the moon,
3261000	3263000	I guess, like I've been harping about.
3263000	3264000	We could just do that.
3264000	3268000	Or just, you know, fix the education system in America.
3268000	3269000	That would help.
3269000	3271000	That sounds hard.
3271000	3273000	It is hard.
3273000	3275000	I got it all figured out.
3275000	3277000	What do you think I should do?
3277000	3279000	As a, now I'm talking to the history,
3279000	3281000	to the leader of children,
3281000	3285000	the consumer of my hit podcast,
3285000	3288000	and just a general, like, nice-seeming guy,
3288000	3291000	like, what do you think I should do in the face of all this?
3291000	3294000	I'll give you the spectrum in my head is ranges from,
3294000	3297000	I'm supposed to use my pulpit
3297000	3300000	to make people think correctly
3300000	3302000	or accomplish something on the other side.
3302000	3304000	I'm supposed to stop thinking about this
3304000	3307000	and give people something to laugh about
3307000	3310000	with my rubber ducky squeaking.
3310000	3312000	Forget, okay.
3312000	3315000	I think you should write Kung Fu Panda 4.
3315000	3316000	Yeah.
3316000	3318000	Like, what is the, what am I, what's the path?
3318000	3319000	Like, my therapist can't help me
3319000	3321000	because she used to tell me,
3321000	3323000	oh, I would come in all upset about Trump.
3323000	3325000	I would go, you know, there's a white nationalist movement happening,
3325000	3327000	and she would go, it's secondhand smoke,
3327000	3329000	it's the internet, you're exposing yourself.
3329000	3331000	And then Trump won, and she was like, oops.
3332000	3335000	But anyways, like, yeah, so I can't really,
3335000	3336000	I don't really know what I'm supposed to,
3336000	3337000	like, who am I?
3337000	3339000	I don't know who I am.
3339000	3343000	Tell me, you beautiful crimson Viking.
3351000	3355000	Honestly, if your therapist can't help you,
3355000	3357000	I probably can't help too much.
3357000	3360000	But also, low res-kai yield
3360000	3362000	because, I mean, you'll never see me again.
3362000	3364000	This is like a one night stand.
3364000	3365000	Well, I'll see you tomorrow
3365000	3366000	because I will be here for your other show.
3366000	3367000	Oh, okay.
3367000	3370000	So, if you don't improve by tomorrow,
3370000	3372000	you can give it to me then.
3377000	3378000	That is exactly what I meant.
3378000	3381000	I think someone's going to get a Jason Ortega name tag.
3382000	3383000	All right, what do you think?
3383000	3384000	No, I'm turned on again.
3384000	3385000	I don't know.
3385000	3387000	Shave your head, move out into the wilderness,
3387000	3389000	start yourself a little commune.
3389000	3390000	Go be Joe Rogan.
3390000	3392000	Joe, yeah, that's Joe Rogan.
3392000	3393000	You're right.
3393000	3396000	I honestly, I read the blog post you put on Tumblr
3396000	3398000	just after the election.
3398000	3400000	Yeah, just me.
3400000	3403000	That's what the Nazis call virtue signal is.
3403000	3404000	Yeah.
3404000	3405000	Yeah.
3405000	3406000	Yeah.
3406000	3411000	Yeah, that's what the Nazis call virtue signaling.
3411000	3414000	That's what they tell me I'm doing.
3414000	3419000	White knighting, mansplaining, beta-pussying.
3419000	3422000	Like, I'm just trying, my instinct was just to like,
3422000	3423000	I hope the women feel better
3423000	3425000	and I hope they think I'm a good person.
3425000	3426000	I don't know.
3426000	3427000	I think that's the stuff I like
3427000	3431000	because the way you write has a lot of conviction to it.
3431000	3432000	Every now and then you'll write something
3432000	3435000	that is a little bit more open and susceptible to change.
3435000	3438000	So with that, when I was reading that,
3438000	3441000	it felt like you were more open to changing
3441000	3443000	your perspectives on things.
3443000	3446000	That's what I like to see and it's not easy.
3446000	3447000	Yeah.
3447000	3448000	But then I should commit to that.
3448000	3449000	Like, I'm an epiphany addict.
3449000	3451000	I just apologize.
3451000	3454000	I should just open like an apology warehouse
3454000	3457000	and just like give people like handcrafted apologies.
3457000	3459000	I don't think you should force it.
3459000	3461000	I think you should just maybe embrace it when it happens.
3461000	3463000	Because otherwise, if you're just constantly forcing
3463000	3466000	that kind of catharsis, it's nothing, I guess.
3466000	3467000	I think the simple answer for me,
3467000	3469000	the obvious answer is write a movie.
3469000	3471000	Like, write a movie.
3471000	3472000	Write a movie.
3472000	3473000	The community movie.
3473000	3478000	But like Dan, a long time ago, when we were both broke,
3478000	3480000	we've talked about this in the show before,
3480000	3482000	like we would like pay each other's rent back and forth
3482000	3485000	depending on who was up or down in the chips at the time.
3485000	3487000	And there's a script that Dan wanted to write
3487000	3490000	based on a certain mythological, like Greek myth character
3490000	3491000	and so like that.
3491000	3495000	I always really wanted to see Dan write that.
3495000	3499000	And you've got 19,000 TV shows going now,
3499000	3501000	and you got a book and all this stuff.
3501000	3509000	But like I think use the knife that's in your knife holder.
3509000	3514000	See, I ain't no writer.
3514000	3516000	But like use the tools that you're good at.
3516000	3517000	Like write stuff.
3517000	3519000	Like write things about...
3519000	3521000	Because the joke in the documentary is that
3521000	3523000	you're a writer that writes about heroes,
3523000	3525000	and heroes by nature have to change.
3525000	3527000	That's the point of a heroic journey,
3527000	3530000	that you start one way and you end something bigger.
3530000	3532000	And that you're an epiphany junkie,
3532000	3534000	and you don't change.
3534000	3536000	You've talked about that before.
3536000	3538000	So maybe you don't have to change,
3538000	3541000	but you have to keep writing stories with heroes that do,
3541000	3543000	because that's the point of art,
3543000	3545000	is that it makes sense of suffering
3545000	3549000	and gives us a language of change.
3549000	3550000	I'm done.
3550000	3556000	That's what I meant.
3556000	3559000	But first, a quick game of audience sound effects.
3559000	3562000	I think we should play that thing.
3562000	3563000	That's why I brought it up,
3563000	3566000	because I was like that would be a funny callback he explained.
3566000	3569000	All right, well, I already forgot your name.
3569000	3572000	Ryan.
3572000	3573000	Ryan, one more thing.
3573000	3577000	Have you ever heard of the porn phrase CFNM?
3577000	3578000	Yeah.
3578000	3580000	It's clothed female nude male.
3580000	3582000	Yeah.
3582000	3584000	I just discovered it, and it's very exciting to me.
3584000	3587000	It's great.
3587000	3589000	It's a naked dude, but the woman's dressed.
3589000	3591000	Personally, I don't care if the guy's naked or not,
3591000	3593000	but it's a clothed female part.
3593000	3596000	But you can't just type in CF.
3596000	3598000	Well, I guess that's non-nude.
3598000	3602000	But yeah, I'm very attracted to clothed women.
3602000	3604000	I understand.
3604000	3609000	There's a lot of clothed women in the audience right now.
3609000	3611000	Don't remind me.
3611000	3615000	Almost two-thirds.
3615000	3616000	Yeah, okay.
3616000	3617000	Yeah, I was just wondering.
3617000	3618000	Oh, and also, have you...
3618000	3620000	Where is this going?
3620000	3621000	I'm just asking him some stuff.
3621000	3622000	I'm open to it.
3622000	3623000	He's responding to him.
3623000	3625000	He's popping.
3625000	3627000	I think I speak for the audience,
3627000	3629000	and I think we're all kind of falling in love with Ryan.
3629000	3630000	Yeah, we love him.
3630000	3631000	We love him.
3632000	3635000	He's a good Sydney-sider.
3635000	3639000	Have you downloaded Mario Run?
3639000	3640000	It's like 15 bucks or something, isn't it?
3640000	3642000	Well, there's a paywall after the first four levels.
3642000	3644000	Oh, yeah, you get three levels, and then you have to pay.
3644000	3645000	I think it's like 10 bucks.
3645000	3646000	What?
3646000	3649000	I knew there was paywalls, but that's fucking crazy.
3649000	3650000	Yeah.
3650000	3651000	God damn.
3651000	3653000	So that can't be funny anymore.
3653000	3654000	I should leave.
3654000	3655000	I'll go.
3655000	3656000	It'll be fine.
3656000	3658000	That's so fucking stupid.
3658000	3659000	God damn it.
3659000	3662000	It's on a flip this table.
3665000	3666000	I would.
3666000	3667000	I would.
3667000	3668000	I'd have to put it back.
3668000	3669000	That's the problem.
3669000	3672000	I like the fact that you were quiet during the Trump and the Hitler stuff,
3672000	3678000	but Mario really is a being your bonnet.
3678000	3679000	I'm trying.
3679000	3682000	Speaking of Trump, this is probably just false hope to cling to,
3682000	3683000	but I heard someone talking.
3683000	3687000	You know, now that the FBI has agreed that Russia has definitely hacked the
3688000	3689000	election.
3689000	3694000	Um, the thing is like Trump could be tried for treason because he knew and
3694000	3697000	possibly aided and abetted in the help,
3697000	3701000	helping a hostile foreign power wage war on our country,
3701000	3703000	which is literally the definition of treason.
3703000	3708000	So I think that there's actually a treason case that could be made against
3708000	3709000	him.
3709000	3710000	Yeah.
3710000	3711000	Yeah.
3711000	3715000	Then it's just sit back and let common sense take its course.
3718000	3720000	It's not going to happen.
3720000	3722000	I mean, I mean, I mean, it has to happen.
3722000	3723000	It needs to happen.
3723000	3725000	But like, no, it's not going to happen.
3725000	3727000	Like the horse has left a stable.
3727000	3729000	Well, I feel like people keep predicting it'll go like, oh, well,
3729000	3731000	he's going to, he's the Medicare.
3731000	3733000	Like, like the people are going to the people that got him elected,
3733000	3735000	they're going to lose their fucking Obamacare.
3735000	3740000	It's, it's, it's poor white old people with like PTSD from wars and stuff
3740000	3744000	that were getting insurance under Obama that didn't understand what that
3744000	3745000	meant.
3745000	3746000	They were like, fuck Obamacare.
3746000	3749000	Cause it was like dog whistle for like black guy care.
3749000	3752000	Like, like they were like, there's a black guy in the white house.
3752000	3753000	That means what?
3753000	3757000	Smart white people would rather hang out with smart black people than me.
3757000	3762000	Um, they, they, they got fucking mad and they overthrew the, the, the,
3762000	3764000	anyways, I'm saying those people are going to get their fucking health
3764000	3768000	benefits taken away, but they're not going to then go, wait a minute.
3768000	3776000	I think this guy was with inhuman hair who is like, he wears fucking ball
3776000	3777000	caps.
3777000	3778000	You can't be president.
3778000	3779000	You wear a goddamn trucker hat.
3779000	3780000	Who is this?
3780000	3781000	You know, that was a big trick.
3781000	3785000	That was, that was a political strategy because he knows how fucking insane
3785000	3786000	his hair is.
3786000	3789000	And that took it completely out of the picture.
3789000	3790000	I can't be shot.
3790000	3791000	You can't have all these wars.
3791000	3792000	I think he wore it.
3792000	3794000	We're like, when he got off of like a helicopter,
3794000	3796000	exactly where there's wind.
3796000	3797000	Yeah, exactly.
3797000	3798000	And it took it out of the equation.
3798000	3800000	And he's like, this is my life now.
3800000	3803000	I think, I think it was smarter than that.
3803000	3804000	Even smarter.
3804000	3806000	That fucking word can't be used.
3806000	3809000	I think it was more strategic than that.
3809000	3812000	Cause like that, that guy, like he's been wearing that hair for a long time.
3812000	3816000	And like, like, like it's been fine, like bandying it about, but I,
3816000	3820000	that baseball cap was a real signifier to this whole rust belt.
3820000	3822000	Like it was like, like there's a baseball cap.
3822000	3825000	I'm going to wear it indoors and it's going to have like generic felt letters.
3825000	3826000	Iron on to it.
3826000	3827000	Nothing fancy about it.
3827000	3830000	Cause every, every, every Trump supporter I've talked to, it's like,
3830000	3834000	it always comes down to like this anti-intellectual kind of revolution.
3834000	3838000	Like it comes down to this, like you've smart Frasiers think that you're so
3838000	3841000	smart, but I guess you weren't smart enough to win.
3841000	3844000	And like, I grew up in Milwaukee.
3844000	3847000	Like I just, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, hey man, I'm,
3847000	3850000	I'm down for an anti-intellectual revolution.
3850000	3855000	I want to be, I want to be dirty and ludite and fucking isolationist,
3855000	3860000	maybe kind of, but why is our leader a East coast trust fund pussy?
3860000	3861000	Like what?
3861000	3863000	Anyways, you guys don't need to hear this.
3863000	3864000	You have your own problems.
3864000	3865000	What am I doing?
3865000	3867000	Why would I come here and dump this on you?
3867000	3870000	You, you already probably have to read about it in the,
3870000	3871000	like the Australian Gazette.
3871000	3873000	You're like, there's, why is that?
3873000	3875000	Why are we reading about this guy?
3875000	3876000	He's a million miles away.
3876000	3880000	If he, the day he decided to come here, it'd be 15 hours from,
3880000	3881000	from here.
3881000	3884000	You guys could like by the time he got here, you could just punch him.
3885000	3886000	I just love it for five days.
3886000	3887000	I have not heard.
3887000	3889000	I haven't watched any U S news sources.
3889000	3892000	I read a couple of Aussie papers, read a great,
3892000	3895000	very uplifting story about a dog who saved a baby from a snake.
3896000	3901000	I saw a story of the fucking snake bit the dog and then they took the dog in
3901000	3904000	and $6,000 for the, for the dog.
3904000	3908000	Like they paid $6,000 to get that dog alive because he's a baby saving dog.
3908000	3909000	Yeah.
3909000	3910000	Well, the, yeah, that's, that's us.
3910000	3913000	That's, that's the whole point of, uh, of, uh, you know, breeding.
3913000	3916000	Like, uh, you want to definitely want that dog to have more dogs.
3918000	3922000	Like that's, that's what, that's what got us to them bringing us newspapers is
3922000	3923000	like that.
3923000	3924000	It's like that thing saved a baby.
3925000	3928000	So this one, but you're talking about, you're talking about dog.
3929000	3931000	You're talking about dog eugenics now.
3932000	3933000	Yeah.
3933000	3935000	We don't want to practice that on each other.
3935000	3936000	We don't.
3936000	3937000	Yeah.
3937000	3939000	Because you can't, you, Stephen Hawking never brought anybody on newspaper.
3939000	3945000	Like, like, well, he, he, he, he brought us a new way of thinking about black
3945000	3946000	holes.
3946000	3947000	He did.
3947000	3948000	It just took a lot longer.
3956000	3959000	As the comic Vernon Chapman said, Stephen Hawking, sure.
3959000	3960000	He can talk to talk.
3960000	3961000	Oh boy.
3962000	3965000	That's not the best opener of all time.
3965000	3967000	That's, that's Brisbane humor.
3971000	3972000	I'm just kidding.
3972000	3974000	I know there's people who are at the Brisbane show that came here.
3975000	3977000	Uh, uh, like Carl.
3979000	3981000	Um, wait, I was, I was about to talk about something.
3981000	3983000	I can't remember what are you having a good time.
3983000	3984000	Do you like to drink?
3984000	3985000	I'm having the best time.
3985000	3986000	Okay, good.
3986000	3987000	All right.
3987000	3988000	Good.
3988000	3989000	Uh, you're important to me.
3990000	3991000	It's true.
3991000	3992000	No, you're, you're a lifeline.
3992000	3993000	You've been a godsend.
3993000	3994000	You're wonderful.
3994000	4000000	Like you're, you're a tall, live alabaster skinned, um, prometheus.
4002000	4004000	You really, you really knitted this show together.
4004000	4007000	I really, for the listeners that can't see, and I don't want to be reductive
4007000	4008000	in any way here.
4008000	4010000	I want this only, I only mean this complimentary.
4010000	4012000	You, you know, the, I don't know if you get these down here, the, uh, the
4012000	4016000	Christmas time Rankin and bass animated like, like, like Rudolph.
4017000	4019000	Remember when Chris Santa Claus was young?
4020000	4022000	Young Chris Kingo.
4022000	4024000	When he was young, he was young and thin and had red eyes.
4024000	4026000	He's a fucking image of him.
4027000	4028000	Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
4028000	4029000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4029000	4030000	Yeah.
4030000	4031000	He really looks like young, young Santa.
4031000	4032000	All right.
4032000	4033000	But we should, we should.
4033000	4034000	You're like a hot young Santa.
4036000	4037000	Thank you.
4037000	4038000	I hear that a lot.
4038000	4039000	Really?
4039000	4040000	Yes.
4040000	4043000	But we should let him, we should let him relax and, and earn his, uh,
4043000	4045000	earn his, uh, kettle on the rocks.
4046000	4047000	Uh, uh, I already forgot your name.
4047000	4048000	Can't thank you.
4048000	4049000	It's Ryan.
4049000	4050000	Ryan.
4050000	4051000	Ryan.
4051000	4052000	Okay.
4052000	4053000	I'm bad with names.
4053000	4054000	Ryan, thank you so much for coming.
4054000	4055000	Everybody.
4055000	4056000	Ryan.
4056000	4057000	Ryan.
4057000	4073000	It's a, is a quintessential Australian is a quintessential modern Australian.
4073000	4074000	Yeah.
4074000	4077000	That's the Australian that will save the United States.
4077000	4081000	Like when we are being, we've been taken over by the Soviets.
4081000	4082000	Yeah.
4082000	4083000	Yeah.
4083000	4084000	The, the Mad Max won't be a tough guy in a car.
4084000	4085000	It'll be a teacher.
4085000	4086000	Yeah.
4087000	4088000	Yeah.
4088000	4090000	Dropping in on some homemade weather balloon that he made out of rabbit pelts
4090000	4093000	and pickle skin.
4093000	4094000	Pickle skin.
4095000	4096000	Pickle skin.
4096000	4098000	Just, I don't know.
4098000	4100000	I tried to improvise something savage sounding.
4101000	4110000	Cause it's the most wild thing I've encountered in 30 years is pickle skin and the Wikipedia
4110000	4111000	entry for Sydney.
4111000	4113000	There's a lot of spiders here.
4113000	4114000	All right.
4114000	4115000	Hot Canada.
4115000	4116000	All right.
4116000	4121000	So it's expensive here, but it's nonetheless rated one of the 10 most livable cities.
4121000	4123000	Don't know what livable means.
4123000	4124000	I don't know what that means.
4124000	4125000	This is not funny.
4125000	4126000	This is just true.
4126000	4127000	I had one of the best dinners of my life.
4127000	4128000	I'm a vegetarian.
4128000	4129000	Went to Bodhi.
4129000	4130000	I'm good.
4131000	4132000	Okay.
4132000	4133000	Oh man.
4133000	4134000	Me too.
4134000	4137000	I left Rockpool because I was disgusted with the place.
4137000	4143000	And then I went home and I went back to the hotel and I put on Good Burger and I ate a
4143000	4145000	whole box of Cheez-its.
4146000	4147000	Yeah.
4147000	4148000	Do you guys have Cheez-its here?
4148000	4149000	No.
4149000	4150000	Oh, they're great.
4150000	4151000	You get you some.
4152000	4153000	All right.
4153000	4155000	Let's meet another Australian.
4155000	4158000	I want to tell you in advance, whoever you are, it's okay for you to disappoint us.
4158000	4160000	You can't follow that.
4161000	4163000	Just commit to being yourself.
4165000	4170000	That's the sound of people already forgiving you in advance for being a huge letdown.
4172000	4174000	Should we base it on something?
4174000	4178000	I would usually just go out there, I guess, but that's how I got...
4178000	4179000	What's his name?
4179000	4180000	Ryan.
4183000	4184000	He's the worst person.
4184000	4185000	He really is bad.
4185000	4186000	I just don't have...
4187000	4192000	Okay, so the thing is, do you know how a baby's brain runs on glucose?
4194000	4195000	This is my theory now.
4195000	4196000	I'm not a doctor.
4196000	4197000	I was not familiar with that.
4198000	4201000	But I think that when you're learning to do things like walk and run and throw a ball
4201000	4205000	and recognize faces and things, I think that your brain is going like,
4205000	4207000	oh, this part of the brain is really important.
4207000	4209000	This part is not so much important.
4209000	4213000	I think recognizing names and faces and things, my brain just never...
4214000	4215000	I just think I'm like...
4215000	4217000	I just have like a dead spot in my brain.
4217000	4218000	Like, I can't...
4218000	4219000	That's my excuse.
4219000	4220000	That's what I'm saying.
4220000	4221000	I just think...
4223000	4224000	If you ever think...
4224000	4227000	If you think I'm a bad person, because he's like, oh, why doesn't he remember me?
4227000	4229000	Why doesn't he remember my name or my face?
4229000	4231000	It's right before you think that guy's an asshole.
4231000	4233000	Then that's when I swoop in with the...
4233000	4234000	I was bullied!
4236000	4239000	I think what you're saying is that when God was handing out baby glucose,
4239000	4241000	you were at the back of the line.
4241000	4242000	Yeah.
4243000	4244000	What did it profit me?
4244000	4248000	Oh, the guy on the left that's giving me a swirly in the toilet?
4248000	4249000	That's Nathan?
4249000	4250000	Oh, great.
4251000	4254000	I'll be sure to ask him about soccer next time.
4255000	4256000	Did you ever actually get a swirly?
4257000	4260000	I think my brother probably like read about swirlies
4260000	4262000	and like tried to give me one, maybe.
4262000	4264000	You guys know what a swirly is, right?
4265000	4267000	It's when you put someone's head in the toilet.
4267000	4268000	And then flush it.
4269000	4271000	It's also called drowning somebody.
4272000	4274000	We call it waterboarding these days.
4274000	4275000	Yeah.
4275000	4277000	Yeah, I mean, News Flash, like physically forcing anyone
4277000	4279000	into any position physically is like horrible.
4279000	4280000	Are you leaving?
4280000	4281000	What's going on?
4282000	4283000	I'm coming up into the stands.
4283000	4285000	He's turning to Peter Finch from Network.
4285000	4287000	He's just going to fall down dead.
4287000	4289000	This room's really big.
4289000	4290000	All right.
4293000	4295000	Welcome to Lazy Donahue.
4295000	4302000	Well, I don't want to do well.
4302000	4304000	I'm not going to scan the room visually because then whoever
4304000	4307000	I pick would be like, what do I look fun to you?
4308000	4310000	I look like entertainment to you.
4311000	4312000	I'm a human being.
4312000	4313000	God damn it.
4313000	4315000	Why are you raising your hand down there, sir?
4319000	4321000	I think that's what they call good old fashioned
4321000	4323000	Sydney pragmatism.
4324000	4326000	They're a pragmatic people here.
4326000	4327000	It's a port town.
4327000	4328000	Dan walked up all the way to the back,
4328000	4330000	and there was a guy right down the front.
4330000	4332000	Well, that's hard to ignore.
4332000	4333000	It ain't going up.
4334000	4335000	All right.
4339000	4341000	If you're keeping track, there's no women in Sydney.
4341000	4342000	What's your name, sir?
4342000	4343000	What's your name?
4343000	4344000	Kenny.
4344000	4345000	Kenny, everybody.
4345000	4346000	Welcome, Kenny.
4354000	4355000	What's up, Kenny?
4355000	4356000	There's Spencer.
4356000	4358000	Grab one of these microphones here.
4359000	4360000	Kenny, you're looking very biz-caj.
4360000	4361000	I like that.
4361000	4362000	Thank you.
4362000	4363000	Is this on?
4363000	4364000	Yeah, it could.
4364000	4365000	All right, Kenny, you're up against a lot, you know?
4365000	4367000	Like, it was bad enough you're following Ryan,
4367000	4369000	but you did it voluntarily.
4369000	4371000	Like, you were like, I'm the guy.
4373000	4374000	Like, you can hear.
4374000	4376000	There's kind of a break in the energy,
4376000	4377000	and they're all discussing you.
4377000	4378000	They're going like...
4379000	4380000	I don't know.
4380000	4381000	I don't know.
4381000	4382000	I don't know.
4383000	4385000	I'm looking forward to the Reddit threads, yeah.
4385000	4387000	I've seen the ones about Brisbane.
4387000	4388000	Don't go to Reddit.
4390000	4391000	I know.
4391000	4393000	Go to Reddit to read about anything other than yourself,
4393000	4394000	is my advice.
4394000	4395000	Yeah.
4395000	4396000	Well, normally I'm not on Reddit, so it's fine.
4396000	4397000	You are now.
4397000	4398000	Yeah, that's true.
4398000	4399000	You're going to be...
4399000	4400000	I will regret it.
4400000	4401000	All right.
4401000	4402000	So, your name's Kenny.
4402000	4403000	We already know that.
4403000	4404000	All right.
4404000	4405000	What gives?
4407000	4408000	How are you going?
4408000	4409000	Okay.
4409000	4410000	So, I don't know.
4410000	4411000	I guess the reason I wanted to come up...
4411000	4412000	How many worries do you have?
4413000	4414000	Seven.
4414000	4416000	You're supposed to have no worries.
4416000	4419000	Well, I have crippling social anxiety, so it's like...
4419000	4420000	Oh, do you really?
4420000	4421000	Yeah, yeah.
4421000	4422000	So, you thought, oh, go on stage.
4422000	4423000	Yeah.
4423000	4424000	That's exactly...
4424000	4425000	That's actually, yeah.
4425000	4428000	That's why I went skydiving, because heights are terrifying.
4428000	4429000	Yeah, exactly.
4429000	4431000	Well, that's where they are, the heights.
4431000	4432000	I got married.
4435000	4436000	It's a good place to go.
4436000	4437000	You just blew my fucking mind.
4438000	4439000	All right.
4439000	4441000	So, well, but that's literally it.
4441000	4443000	Do you want me to just dig in, or...
4443000	4444000	I mean, yeah, if you want.
4444000	4448000	But, like, I think one of the other reasons is I went to L.A. earlier this year, and I
4448000	4450000	saw one of your shows, and I was hoping to do that.
4450000	4451000	Who came from the furthest?
4451000	4453000	And then I would be like, Australia?
4453000	4454000	And then...
4454000	4455000	It didn't happen, but that's fine.
4455000	4456000	I'm here now.
4457000	4459000	Oh, more to the point, you're here now, so, yeah.
4459000	4461000	Yeah, and I came the farthest now.
4461000	4462000	Yeah, exactly.
4462000	4464000	That's why we have you up on stage.
4464000	4465000	Yeah.
4465000	4468000	But it would have been weird for everybody in the audience to yell out, who came the
4468000	4470000	farthest when I came out?
4470000	4472000	Because I'd be like, me, me, me, me!
4472000	4475000	Well, I probably didn't come the farthest tonight, so that's fine.
4475000	4476000	All right, yeah.
4476000	4478000	Now, you say you have crippling social anxiety.
4478000	4479000	Sure.
4479000	4480000	How does that, like...
4485000	4486000	Let's just...
4486000	4487000	Let's just...
4487000	4488000	Let's just presume you do.
4490000	4492000	Let's just make that the premise.
4493000	4496000	How does that manifest in your daily life, or...?
4496000	4502000	Well, I mean, I've gotten better with it since working in retail, because you learn to pretend
4502000	4505000	that the people aren't actually people.
4506000	4510000	It's sort of like, you know, Westworld, they're all just hosts, and they're on their loop.
4510000	4513000	They're just like, they want something, and then you have to have some exchange with them
4513000	4514000	and stuff, and it's, yeah.
4514000	4515000	It's like, I'm pretending...
4515000	4518000	But if it's Westworld, aren't you the host?
4519000	4520000	Actually, that's pretty apt.
4520000	4523000	I'm in my cycle, yeah, working retail.
4523000	4524000	Yeah.
4524000	4526000	Would you like a drink?
4527000	4530000	It's probably entertaining to see me heave every time I take a sip, so sure.
4530000	4531000	Yeah.
4531000	4533000	I don't do well with spirits, but sure, let's go ahead.
4533000	4535000	No, let's not kill you.
4535000	4536000	No, no.
4536000	4537000	It's fine.
4537000	4538000	It's fine.
4538000	4539000	I'll be right back.
4539000	4540000	We'll get you a nice shoe to vomit it, and it'll be great.
4540000	4541000	Yeah.
4541000	4542000	I mean, I got two here.
4542000	4543000	Yeah.
4543000	4544000	It's fine.
4544000	4546000	You don't have to drink that.
4546000	4547000	No, no, no.
4547000	4548000	Don't get me wrong.
4548000	4549000	I like drinking.
4549000	4551000	It's just that it's the only thing here, so that's fine.
4551000	4552000	Yeah.
4552000	4555000	No, it's not.
4555000	4556000	Okay.
4556000	4557000	No, okay.
4557000	4558000	He's just saying, what?
4558000	4559000	You're a beer guy.
4559000	4560000	Yeah, there's no beer up here.
4560000	4561000	Yeah, exactly.
4561000	4562000	That's fine.
4562000	4563000	Dude, you just...
4563000	4566000	You made Jeff leave.
4566000	4567000	You offended him.
4567000	4569000	He made me want to get you a beer.
4569000	4570000	Oh, okay.
4570000	4571000	Yeah, I didn't see what happened.
4571000	4572000	It's beer country.
4572000	4574000	I wouldn't presume that anybody...
4575000	4580000	I've had to walk many, many bartenders through making me a Negroni on this trip.
4580000	4581000	I don't know what that is.
4581000	4582000	Yeah, exactly.
4582000	4583000	It's a drink.
4583000	4587000	It's equal parts sweet vermouth, gin, and Campari.
4587000	4590000	It's a yummy daytime beverage.
4592000	4593000	There you go.
4593000	4594000	All right.
4594000	4597000	You've got a Coke, a beer, and a...
4597000	4598000	You got the beer?
4598000	4599000	All right.
4599000	4600000	Yeah, Michelle.
4605000	4606000	Thank you, Jeff.
4614000	4615000	All right.
4615000	4616000	Here we go.
4616000	4618000	It's not a competition.
4618000	4620000	No, it's Australia.
4620000	4621000	All right.
4621000	4622000	Kenny...
4622000	4623000	It's not a competition.
4623000	4624000	It's Australia.
4624000	4626000	So, well, okay.
4626000	4629000	Well, tell us more.
4629000	4630000	What would you like to know?
4630000	4632000	Social anxiety.
4633000	4637000	You don't have the handshake of a socially anxious person.
4638000	4641000	When Dan was walking through the crowd looking for somebody, you were like,
4641000	4642000	you want to come on stage.
4642000	4646000	Is there something that you feel like you could gain from this experience?
4646000	4651000	It's just being up here and letting this weird feeling happen,
4651000	4653000	be its own reward or punishment?
4653000	4655000	I think I realized earlier this year,
4655000	4657000	this is actually after I went to see a show and everything,
4657000	4660000	I was listening to Grandma's virginity podcast
4660000	4664000	and listening to Justin and Ryan talking about writing,
4664000	4667000	and then it suddenly dawned on me that I want to be a fucking writer.
4667000	4673000	So, one physics degree later and working in retail and everything,
4673000	4675000	I finally realized what I want to do.
4680000	4683000	It's sort of like...
4684000	4688000	I can't count how many times I've marathoned community and everything,
4688000	4690000	so I realized that after all this time,
4690000	4693000	you're probably the closest thing I have to an idol sort of thing.
4693000	4696000	No, don't fucking do that.
4697000	4699000	This is not a hero worship thing.
4699000	4701000	This is just like, I really fucking...
4701000	4702000	They feel bad for you.
4702000	4704000	They're like, aww.
4706000	4709000	You really gotta expand your horizons.
4709000	4711000	Yeah.
4711000	4712000	Look at his idol.
4712000	4714000	I hear... was it Ockerman?
4714000	4715000	Ockerman?
4715000	4716000	I should go for him.
4716000	4719000	Yeah, between me and Ockerman.
4719000	4722000	I'd go Ockerman these days.
4722000	4725000	What sort of physics... was there any specialty in that?
4725000	4729000	It was only a bachelor's before I realized I didn't fucking want to do it.
4729000	4732000	Let's experiment with something.
4732000	4735000	When you get a physics degree, you end up doing the whole gamut.
4735000	4739000	You're doing quantum, astro, all that shit.
4739000	4741000	Yeah, it's fun.
4742000	4744000	I'm into physics.
4744000	4747000	I have a terrible brain for math.
4747000	4751000	I'm really not a numbers guy, but I love shows about physics
4751000	4754000	and about quantum theory and all that jazz.
4754000	4758000	But when they start talking about anything that's slightly complicated,
4758000	4761000	it's just so theoretical and abstract.
4761000	4763000	Don't let...
4766000	4772000	For the listeners, Dan is writing a live screenplay about him.
4772000	4774000	Keep talking to him.
4774000	4777000	You and I are gonna talk right now.
4777000	4781000	All the... watching the documentaries and stuff from first-time experience.
4781000	4783000	Kenny, what's your last name?
4783000	4784000	McDonald?
4784000	4785000	McDonald, okay.
4785000	4787000	Was it A or did it MC?
4787000	4788000	MC.
4788000	4790000	Yeah, oh, nice. First guy.
4790000	4794000	I mean, there's only two options, so it's not that impressive, but...
4795000	4797000	LAUGHTER
4798000	4800000	LAUGHTER
4824000	4825000	I mean...
4828000	4832000	Dan, do I read any of this for the podcast or no?
4832000	4834000	I don't know. I don't know.
4834000	4838000	This is gonna make people have to subscribe.
4838000	4841000	We're not even shooting it. Are we shooting it?
4841000	4844000	Maybe we can edit it out of the audio part. I don't know.
4844000	4846000	Let's keep talking.
4846000	4850000	What I was gonna say before is with the watching documentaries and stuff
4850000	4852000	and liking physics documentaries,
4852000	4855000	don't let that trick you into getting a degree in physics,
4855000	4858000	because you won't enjoy it first-hand experience.
4858000	4860000	LAUGHTER
4869000	4871000	I got very, very lucky.
4871000	4875000	I met, you know, Professor Brian Cox, the very charming English...
4875000	4877000	Yeah.
4877000	4879000	You're a long-lost cousin or something?
4879000	4881000	Yeah, wonders of the universe.
4881000	4883000	You look similar.
4884000	4886000	LAUGHTER
4890000	4893000	He invited me to come out and go look at the Large Hadron Collider,
4893000	4895000	which would be fun.
4895000	4897000	But I don't know what it is.
4897000	4899000	I don't know how magnetism works.
4899000	4901000	LAUGHTER
4902000	4904000	LAUGHTER
4910000	4912000	For the listeners,
4912000	4916000	Dan is writing a very culturally sensitive, not hack, script writing.
4919000	4921000	That's me, Kenny McDonald.
4925000	4927000	So...
4927000	4929000	LAUGHTER
4929000	4931000	I guess I kind of screwed this up.
4931000	4933000	Does that imply that I...
4933000	4935000	I guess you don't start that video like the person's born, then you can't.
4935000	4937000	Does that imply that I wasn't a baby, but I am now?
4937000	4939000	This is like Benjamin Button?
4939000	4941000	No, Kenny, no. I would never... I wouldn't do that.
4941000	4943000	What else could have possibly been implying?
4943000	4945000	No, I'm a bad writer.
4945000	4948000	I already painted myself into a corner.
4948000	4952000	Structurally, this type of voiceover doesn't work if the person's being born.
4952000	4954000	No, it works. It works.
4954000	4956000	No, no, it's...
4956000	4958000	I'm actually wondering how I got here.
4958000	4960000	No one's wondering how you got there.
4960000	4962000	How you got there was the sperm...
4962000	4966000	Yeah, cut to some old McDonald's testicle.
4966000	4970000	I like to think that I was like, you know...
4970000	4972000	What's the word? Like Jesus?
4972000	4974000	Yeah, Jesus. Immaculate.
4974000	4976000	Immaculate. Immaculate conception.
4976000	4978000	My parents never had sex. That's fine.
4978000	4980000	No, but why can't you say like...
4980000	4982000	It's him being born, and then you're like a 30-year-old...
4982000	4987000	Yeah, I'm not sure what they say in this case, but I wouldn't always be a baby.
4987000	4990000	People know that, though.
4990000	4996000	All right, so Kenny, you got your degree in physics, which sounds arduous, it sounds difficult.
4996000	4997000	Yeah.
4997000	5001000	And then you said, I don't want to be in physics?
5001000	5002000	Yeah.
5002000	5006000	In your dream, do you want to be like a theoretical particle physicist or something?
5006000	5010000	No. Like, I think...
5010000	5015000	I don't know. I think part of my getting a science degree is kind of to shut people up.
5015000	5019000	When I'm doing something else that I want to do, people can say, what are you doing with your life?
5019000	5021000	I'm like, I have a degree.
5021000	5025000	But that seems like a waste of 40 grand, so I don't know.
5031000	5035000	All of my friends that have made it have one thing in common.
5035000	5042000	None of any of us, and them, because I'm including way more successful friends of mine.
5042000	5044000	None of them has a degree.
5044000	5047000	That's because they're smarter than me, and that's why they're successful.
5047000	5052000	But I went to the University of Southern California, and I...
5060000	5062000	No, it will tend to.
5062000	5063000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5064000	5065000	Yeah.
5065000	5067000	Okay, thanks, Spencer, yeah.
5069000	5074000	Okay, are we going to get some new toning and punch lines going on?
5078000	5080000	Oh, professional, yeah.
5082000	5088000	Like, I went to school. I started as a business major. I suck at math.
5088000	5091000	And then I went into journalism because there was no math requirement.
5092000	5094000	But then by the end, I said, I don't want the degree.
5094000	5096000	I just sneaked into classes that I wasn't allowed to be in.
5096000	5102000	And just like, if I'm going to go to school for free because I was poor and had, like, you know, financial aid and, you know...
5103000	5105000	They told you to take the tests, not the...
5105000	5107000	Yeah, and get the paper at the end.
5107000	5111000	I would just sneak into cool, like, history classes and things that were, like, they tried to take advantage of.
5111000	5113000	Like, that degree would be pretty meaningless.
5115000	5119000	So now, are you going to be a film writer, TV writer? Novelist?
5120000	5121000	TV.
5122000	5127000	Because, like, yeah, I realized that throughout my life, the thing that's probably been said to me the most is, like,
5127000	5130000	get off the fucking TV or, like, stop watching TV or some shit like that.
5130000	5132000	So it's like, what do I love? I love TV.
5132000	5135000	Do you think that when the movie that Dan is writing is made that Adam Scott's going to play you?
5137000	5138000	Sorry.
5138000	5141000	Does it look a little bit like Adam Scott? No, no, no.
5141000	5142000	Maybe just the angle.
5142000	5143000	All right, so...
5144000	5145000	Nope.
5145000	5146000	I don't know who that is.
5149000	5150000	LAUGHTER
5163000	5167000	Should we... Should we perform this later on?
5175000	5177000	I... Yeah, we can perform it.
5178000	5181000	I think we should put this on as a little one-act play later, huh?
5182000	5185000	All right, so now, what's... Have you tried writing? Are you working on stuff?
5185000	5187000	Yeah, like, I'm...
5187000	5192000	Like, I'm on the plotting stage of many things and then I've finished an actual, like...
5192000	5198000	It was attempted to be, like, a pilot episode, but it turned out more like a short film comedy.
5198000	5203000	It's a thing, but, yeah, no, I'm writing when I have time and enjoying it.
5203000	5207000	Is there... I don't know, like, I know a lot of actors that are from here and work in acting here,
5207000	5209000	but is there a big, like, TV writing thing?
5209000	5213000	Like, I'm like... All about TV is kind of shit, especially the comedy.
5213000	5215000	I don't know, like, I...
5216000	5219000	Oh, man, I was listening... I was watching Australian... Sorry, sorry.
5219000	5222000	I was watching Australian Food Network. I hate now comedy.
5222000	5223000	OK, I'll let you talk.
5223000	5224000	Sorry, sorry.
5224000	5225000	It's fine.
5225000	5226000	Sorry, what was...
5226000	5232000	I was watching Australian Food Network. Holy shit, everyone just wanted to talk in front of the camera.
5232000	5235000	There was, like, four cooks and they're like, now I'm making Mars a pan.
5235000	5237000	Well, I'm cooking up grapes.
5237000	5242000	And it's just, like, everyone's talking over each other and I'm like, I don't know how much butter you're using.
5244000	5247000	I don't think they know either, but, yeah, no, that stuff's great, but...
5247000	5249000	Oh, I love Food Network.
5249000	5250000	Yeah, yeah, you know.
5250000	5251000	Oh, yeah.
5251000	5252000	It's the network for the food and...
5252000	5256000	Now you go. What were you going to say before I so rudely cut you off?
5256000	5259000	I'm not paying attention to myself 90% of the time, so...
5259000	5260000	Yeah, yeah.
5260000	5262000	What was your social anxiety doing right now?
5262000	5265000	Is the heart beating fast? Are you settling in?
5265000	5268000	I dealt pretty well with the booze, so I think I'm doing all right.
5269000	5270000	Fuck you, Kenny!
5273000	5275000	No, no, that I've heard a lot. That's fine.
5275000	5276000	That's his father.
5280000	5282000	I've written myself into a corner here.
5282000	5285000	I got a professor just to...
5285000	5287000	I haven't been reading, Dan. Where are we at?
5287000	5289000	Like, can you put me up to date?
5289000	5293000	The physics professor made a fireball by lighting his pipe or something.
5293000	5294000	Cleaning his pipe. My bad.
5294000	5297000	Yeah, he's just cleaning his pipe and his pipe bursts into flame,
5297000	5299000	and then Kenny's climbing to his feet,
5299000	5301000	and then he'll say,
5301000	5305000	Professor, take me away from here.
5307000	5310000	Is this a magical reality kind of thing?
5310000	5311000	With pleasure.
5313000	5314000	Uh-oh.
5315000	5317000	Enter Jason Ortega.
5320000	5322000	Oh, I know how to get out of this. I know how to do this.
5322000	5323000	You want another?
5323000	5324000	I've seen this done before.
5324000	5325000	I would love another.
5325000	5328000	Kenny starts to reach for the hand,
5328000	5330000	then recoils...
5333000	5335000	the... oops, shit, sorry.
5335000	5340000	The professor's hand is a robot hand.
5341000	5345000	Cut to Kenny's bedroom.
5346000	5348000	We've got a real world.
5348000	5351000	Kenny bolts up.
5354000	5356000	Screaming.
5357000	5359000	It was a scream.
5361000	5363000	Cop out.
5364000	5367000	Sits up next to him, do a little undercut.
5369000	5371000	Bacon soda.
5372000	5375000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
5387000	5390000	This is getting kind of slashy.
5393000	5396000	Dan, right now, who are you casting as a...
5396000	5399000	What actor is the professor in your mind right now?
5400000	5402000	Mark Ruffalo.
5405000	5407000	He's a professor age now, isn't he?
5407000	5409000	He's got gray hair and everything.
5410000	5413000	I need to put him pouting in one of the action lines.
5414000	5416000	I should put what in the action lines?
5416000	5417000	You need to put him pouting.
5417000	5418000	I put what?
5418000	5419000	His little pout.
5419000	5420000	A little pout?
5420000	5421000	The pout you love.
5421000	5422000	Ruffalo.
5422000	5423000	Oh, the Ruffalo pout.
5423000	5424000	Yeah, sure, okay.
5424000	5426000	Yeah, we call him Ruffalo, but yeah,
5426000	5428000	it's a big difference culturally, but it's fine.
5430000	5435000	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
5436000	5437000	Did you guys see Mark Roo...
5437000	5439000	Do you follow him on Instagram?
5439000	5441000	He was so excited about something that happened
5441000	5443000	with the thing that I should know about,
5443000	5446000	because I'm a good person with the gas line thing or whatever,
5446000	5447000	and he was like,
5447000	5449000	Yes, thank you, thank you so much, thank you,
5449000	5451000	thank you to the Army Corps of Engineers,
5451000	5453000	thank you everybody, thank you so much, thank you.
5453000	5455000	I just wanted to kiss him the whole time.
5455000	5456000	He was so happy.
5456000	5457000	I was just like,
5457000	5460000	what do you have to do to make Mark Ruffalo happy?
5460000	5462000	Because I want to do it all the time.
5462000	5466000	I just want to bring him breakfast and see him get happy.
5467000	5468000	So you're a comedy guy?
5468000	5469000	You can write comedies or dramas?
5469000	5470000	What do you got?
5470000	5471000	I'll try.
5471000	5472000	Yeah, comedy.
5472000	5473000	Yeah.
5473000	5474000	Yeah.
5480000	5483000	Audio is really going to be jarring when people listen to this.
5483000	5484000	It's going to be like dull comment.
5484000	5486000	Yeah, yeah, it's enormous laughter.
5487000	5490000	Yeah, I almost think we'll just have to edit out almost your whole...
5490000	5491000	Yeah, that's fine.
5495000	5496000	I don't know what to do.
5496000	5498000	This was an experiment.
5498000	5500000	I thought, let's have Jeff talk to somebody,
5500000	5501000	and then I'll write a script about them,
5501000	5503000	but it's like, yeah, it's a visual thing.
5503000	5505000	We're having just a regular conversation
5505000	5506000	and a giant lass are happening,
5506000	5509000	because you're making Mark Ruffalo fuck Adam Scott
5509000	5511000	over behind our shows.
5511000	5512000	Let's do this.
5512000	5514000	That's as good an ending as any.
5514000	5515000	Faint it out.
5517000	5518000	Got it.
5520000	5521000	Okay.
5526000	5527000	Is there anything...
5527000	5529000	You're an aspiring writer, Kenny.
5529000	5532000	Is there anything you can think of not to put you on the spot?
5532000	5535000	Is there anything I could show you or help, you know,
5535000	5536000	like something that...
5536000	5538000	I don't know, some people...
5538000	5539000	How do I get a job?
5540000	5541000	Anything other than...
5541000	5543000	Like creatively, what can I impart to you?
5543000	5545000	What do you always wonder about?
5545000	5546000	Dan, where do you get it?
5546000	5547000	How does it happen?
5549000	5551000	How do you keep your hair so soft and manageable?
5554000	5556000	I don't know if you want a real answer, I guess.
5556000	5559000	Like, you know, coming up with a concept for a comedy TV show
5559000	5561000	to be running over like multiple seasons,
5561000	5563000	it always feels so like...
5563000	5567000	Like coming up with a concept that doesn't feel so trite and hacky,
5567000	5569000	like, you know, like...
5570000	5574000	Like community is something so like open to the idea of like
5574000	5577000	people coming together and having like real human experiences
5577000	5580000	masked by all this like faucetal shit going on in front of it.
5580000	5581000	Well, that's the only thing.
5581000	5582000	You get...
5582000	5584000	Yeah, there's no such thing as a good idea or a bad idea.
5584000	5585000	It doesn't matter.
5585000	5588000	Like the point of TV is not to be original.
5588000	5593000	The point of TV is to placate, is to give people comfort.
5593000	5594000	You know, it's like tater tots.
5594000	5596000	You don't want to like reinvent the tater tot.
5596000	5598000	Do you guys have tater tots?
5598000	5600000	We call them potato gems, but that's fine.
5600000	5601000	Okay.
5601000	5603000	Somebody's like me accidentally saying something horribly racist
5603000	5604000	but I say tater tots.
5604000	5606000	Yes, we have tater tots.
5606000	5607000	My mother's one.
5610000	5612000	They're called Argentinians.
5616000	5618000	But, you know, it's like community is like...
5618000	5620000	It's a hack idea.
5620000	5621000	I remember people make fun of it
5621000	5624000	because all people knew was the logline of the idea.
5624000	5625000	I remember all the press was like,
5625000	5626000	oh, there's a new NBC show.
5626000	5629000	Joel McHale plays a guy that goes back to college
5629000	5630000	because he lost his thing.
5630000	5631000	And everybody was like, what?
5631000	5632000	Did Seinfeld write this in his show?
5632000	5633000	Like, it's a bad idea.
5633000	5634000	It's like, yeah, it's dumb.
5634000	5635000	Like, it's silly.
5635000	5639000	But so is people in a spaceship going out to Boldly Go
5639000	5640000	where no one's gone before.
5640000	5641000	That's a terrible idea.
5641000	5643000	What do you mean you're going to Boldly Go?
5643000	5644000	What are you talking about?
5644000	5645000	Just going?
5645000	5646000	What are you going to...
5646000	5647000	How do you know when you're finished?
5647000	5648000	But the idea...
5649000	5653000	The idea is to get people, well, at least for...
5653000	5655000	I mean, this isn't the only job TV has,
5655000	5658000	but the idea is to get people in...
5658000	5659000	9-11.
5659000	5660000	9-11.
5660000	5661000	Oh, it's 9-11.
5664000	5665000	Yeah, it's 9-11.
5665000	5666000	Good job.
5667000	5668000	Bless you, sir.
5670000	5671000	The town crier.
5673000	5674000	It's 9-11.
5674000	5675000	It knows well.
5677000	5679000	It's 9-11 and I like that hat, mate.
5679000	5685000	I dislike them tellers coming down, mate.
5688000	5689000	He said dislike.
5689000	5690000	He dislikes it.
5691000	5692000	I just like them.
5692000	5693000	Oh, no.
5693000	5694000	Not just like them.
5694000	5695000	No, no.
5695000	5696000	Who would like them?
5696000	5697000	It's the only thing he likes.
5697000	5698000	I just like them.
5698000	5700000	Often in 11, life was like null and void for him.
5700000	5702000	It was all downhill from there.
5702000	5704000	But, you know, like...
5704000	5705000	Yeah, no, you just...
5706000	5711000	You know how when it's raining, like people are in a weirder...
5713000	5714000	Happens occasionally, yeah.
5714000	5715000	Yeah.
5715000	5719000	It's like if it starts to really come down, like everybody who's anywhere,
5719000	5721000	they all have to get out of the rain.
5721000	5724000	So then it's like, oh, then every once in a while it's raining
5724000	5727000	and you're stuck with a bunch of people that you don't know.
5727000	5730000	And you're like, huh, it's raining.
5731000	5733000	But it's like a person you'd never talk to.
5734000	5736000	And they're like, Jesus Christ, yeah, it fucking rained.
5736000	5737000	It started coming out of nowhere.
5737000	5738000	It was crazy.
5738000	5739000	It was dry and then it was wet.
5740000	5742000	And it's like, this would never have happened.
5742000	5744000	And it's like that person might look like a ranger.
5747000	5749000	They're from some different walk of life.
5749000	5753000	They might be liberal with a big L and you're liberal with a small L,
5753000	5756000	meaning you're like both sides of the political spectrum.
5756000	5759000	You're labor and they're capital L liberal.
5760000	5763000	And you're different ages or you're different genders
5763000	5765000	and there's at least 50 known genders.
5767000	5769000	The rain made something happen.
5769000	5770000	The rain is the idea.
5770000	5771000	That's just it.
5771000	5773000	The rain could be, oh, it's the future
5773000	5776000	and so everybody's in a starship and they have to go do stuff.
5776000	5777000	That's a contrivance.
5777000	5779000	Rain is a contrivance.
5779000	5781000	It's like, oh, God happened.
5781000	5783000	You can have one coincidence in your story.
5783000	5785000	This is for TV writing.
5785000	5787000	You just go like, oh, what's something stupid
5787000	5788000	that made a bunch of people have to be together?
5788000	5789000	Kind of forever.
5789000	5790000	Mostly forever.
5790000	5792000	For 100 episodes or so.
5792000	5793000	Also, this is really old-fashioned advice
5793000	5796000	because TV now is like,
5796000	5799000	I'm talking about 80s style craftsmanship
5799000	5800000	and TV now is like,
5800000	5802000	oh, just take a shitty 90-minute directed video movie,
5802000	5805000	break it up into 10 chapters and release it one at a time.
5807000	5811000	This TV series is called Cobra Man.
5811000	5814000	Episode one, man.
5815000	5818000	Episode two, man at a cobra store.
5820000	5824000	Episode three, all at the cobra store ain't what it seems.
5825000	5827000	Episode four, cobra escape.
5827000	5830000	Episode five, mixed blessings.
5835000	5838000	Episode six, a most unusual power.
5838000	5841000	Episode seven, cobra man.
5842000	5844000	Episode eight, shark jumped.
5847000	5849000	Episode nine, bat clean up.
5849000	5851000	Episode 10, clip show.
5853000	5855000	But yeah, I mean, it's serialized now
5855000	5856000	and that's a whole different discipline.
5856000	5857000	I don't really understand that.
5857000	5859000	I figure if I tell a serialized story,
5859000	5860000	I'll write a movie.
5860000	5863000	No one wants me to write a movie.
5863000	5865000	I want you to write a movie.
5865000	5867000	I'm gonna write a movie, okay?
5867000	5868000	Yeah, it'll be great.
5868000	5870000	You gotta write.
5870000	5872000	You gotta write fucking Cobra Man.
5872000	5873000	I'm gonna write Cobra Man.
5873000	5876000	But in my opinion, TV is supposed to be like crack.
5876000	5879000	It's like each rock is an individual rock.
5879000	5882000	Like you should be able to grab any rock in any order
5882000	5884000	and it would get you high
5884000	5887000	and you'll want to smoke all the crack rocks.
5888000	5890000	And you'll even, if you're then told
5890000	5892000	they come in a certain order, you'll go like,
5892000	5893000	yeah, I'm a crack head.
5893000	5894000	I'll meet you.
5894000	5897000	Like sure, if there's a number one on one of the crack rocks,
5897000	5899000	if it rolls under the couch
5899000	5901000	and there's only two, five, and seven,
5901000	5903000	I'm still gonna smoke the crack.
5905000	5907000	I don't owe it to the fucking crack
5907000	5909000	to consume it in a certain order
5909000	5911000	and the crack ought to meet me halfway.
5911000	5914000	As a crack head, it's the least the crack can do
5914000	5916000	to not fuck with me.
5916000	5917000	And so I'm like, what the hell?
5917000	5919000	Why is Jillian Anderson, where did she go?
5919000	5921000	Is this her dream now?
5921000	5922000	But I love the fall.
5922000	5923000	Have you seen the fall?
5923000	5924000	No.
5924000	5925000	So good.
5925000	5926000	See, that's serialized story.
5926000	5928000	That was a great message for the kids.
5928000	5930000	I'm glad Ryan was here to hear that,
5930000	5932000	so he can pass that along to the children.
5932000	5934000	Look at the crack metaphor.
5934000	5935000	Yeah.
5935000	5938000	But like a good sitcom, a good TV show is,
5938000	5941000	in my opinion, is a necklace made of crack rocks
5941000	5944000	because it's like, you provide the order.
5944000	5947000	Maybe you do put a big honking rock right in the middle
5947000	5950000	and you say, smoke from left to right as you would.
5951000	5953000	But there's a string connecting all of them.
5953000	5954000	You can wear it.
5954000	5956000	You can tell your friends about it at a party.
5956000	5957000	They'll go, hey, what's that you got around your neck?
5957000	5959000	It's a crack necklace.
5960000	5961000	I love it.
5961000	5962000	I smoke this one.
5962000	5963000	I smoke that one.
5963000	5965000	Oh, crack's not for me.
5965000	5967000	No, that's other people's crack.
5967000	5968000	Let me tell you about this.
5968000	5970000	This is Rick and Morty crack.
5970000	5971000	This is great.
5974000	5977000	So anyway, so there's no such thing as a bad idea.
5977000	5980000	The worst kind of idea that you could have is the thing
5980000	5985000	where you start thinking like, oh, this sounds like TV.
5985000	5986000	This will make a good TV show.
5986000	5989000	You're going to do that by default because you love TV.
5989000	5990000	You want to write good TV.
5990000	5992000	You're going to always second guess yourself
5992000	5994000	and be like, you're going to always be filtering things
5994000	5996000	through like, oh, and then it would be like a TV show
5996000	5997000	if I did it like this.
5997000	6002000	The way that you make good stuff is by restraining that.
6002000	6007000	You have to force your TV loving, structure craving,
6007000	6010000	self loathing, nothing inside my head deserves to be
6010000	6011000	on television brain.
6011000	6014000	You have to force it, actively force it
6015000	6017000	into the non televisable realm.
6017000	6020000	Go like, what is the memory that I have that is so fucked up
6020000	6024000	it cannot be, it doesn't go near, it's too boring
6024000	6029000	or it's too pornographic or it's too bloody or it's too sad.
6029000	6033000	It's just too like personal to me.
6033000	6035000	It doesn't make that much sense.
6035000	6039000	And try as hard as you can to not let that get filtered
6039000	6042000	through that other part of your brain, which everyone has anyway.
6043000	6045000	That's the unremarkable part of your brain that turns it
6045000	6049000	into Gilligan's Island, which is a great show.
6049000	6052000	But the person that created Gilligan's Island wasn't like,
6052000	6055000	I'm going to try to make a show like Gilligan's Island.
6055000	6057000	That was a weird byproduct of them.
6057000	6059000	I don't know who knows what they were thinking.
6059000	6060000	Sure would choice, right?
6060000	6062000	His thing was he made TV.
6062000	6065000	He was like, I want to make sure that people will really
6065000	6066000	have to watch.
6066000	6068000	He would do anything.
6068000	6070000	He didn't care about the rules at all.
6070000	6072000	There have been many, many attempts since Gilligan's Island
6072000	6076000	to make shows about a group of people stranded on a desert island.
6076000	6079000	And they have all sucked.
6079000	6082000	This is the part where Dan dies and it's very sad.
6082000	6086000	I talked while I was drinking and went down the rug pipe.
6086000	6089000	As you get older, there's another thing, I can tell you.
6089000	6094000	Jenny, as you get older, especially if you drink a fifth
6094000	6099000	of vodka a day, your esophagus flap will start to degrade
6099000	6101000	the toilet flap.
6101000	6104000	You have to replace the toilet flap every once in a while.
6104000	6106000	You go to the hardware store.
6106000	6108000	Maybe your parents do this.
6108000	6110000	Millennial, so I don't do anything.
6110000	6112000	There's a little rubber flap in the toilet that you have a
6112000	6114000	flesh one in here, but you can't replace it.
6114000	6116000	It just melts.
6116000	6120000	You've eroded your epiglottis or whatever.
6120000	6123000	After I turned 40, one day I was in a movie theater
6123000	6127000	and I was eating popcorn while going, those Muppets are funny.
6127000	6133000	But this is a hypothetical scenario, believe me.
6133000	6135000	Dan hates the Muppets.
6135000	6139000	But I inhaled, the Muppets hate the Muppets, man.
6139000	6144000	Jim Henson loved the Muppets and he's dead.
6144000	6147000	The Muppets killed Jim Henson?
6147000	6150000	No, I'm saying you can't keep doing.
6150000	6154000	If you can't make phones after Steve Jobs dies and make them
6154000	6158000	you can't make no Muppets.
6158000	6160000	You're the Heimlich? What's going on over there?
6160000	6163000	I got droplets of vodka, went down my breathing tube.
6163000	6165000	Well, just like absorb them.
6165000	6169000	You absorb them.
6169000	6171000	He just drank more vodka, he's going to wash it down.
6171000	6173000	This guy doesn't fucking learn.
6173000	6175000	Well, what's going to work, water?
6175000	6176000	Hugs?
6176000	6178000	Hugs.
6178000	6181000	The Heimlich maneuver is just one big hug.
6181000	6183000	A series of very strong hugs.
6183000	6188000	Anyways, so then I inhaled popcorn.
6188000	6191000	You have to chew very carefully now.
6191000	6193000	There's an episode of the podcast where I almost died.
6193000	6198000	The rest of the show is going to be Dan sounding like drunk Nick Nolte.
6198000	6200000	All right.
6200000	6205000	What other advice can I give you?
6205000	6212000	You're talking about, is it a physical thing or is that you're just being hypochondriacal?
6212000	6215000	Steve Levy.
6215000	6221000	Can we give it up for Steve Levy, everybody?
6221000	6224000	Steve Levy.
6224000	6230000	He's Dan's, like, you know, he's, what's Batman's butler's guy?
6230000	6231000	Alfred.
6231000	6232000	He's Alfred.
6232000	6235000	But this guy goes to the gym like every 45 minutes.
6235000	6239000	This guy's got like, he's got abs on his face.
6239000	6240000	This is Steve Levy's laptop.
6240000	6244000	We should reward him by going through his photos.
6244000	6246000	Oh, my God.
6246000	6248000	What are the Olsen twins doing on here?
6248000	6250000	Please find something awful.
6250000	6251000	No.
6251000	6254000	Would there be anything we would find in your photo roll that would be embarrassing?
6254000	6258000	Well, you just scrolled past a, what do you call it, a story circle.
6258000	6260000	So it's definitely, there could definitely be trade secrets.
6260000	6266000	Oh, there could definitely be like a, like a, like a, like a, like a Doctor Strange treatment or something.
6266000	6269000	It could be Cobra Man.
6270000	6272000	We find out that you're stealing that from him.
6272000	6274000	We were doing a show in the States.
6274000	6288000	And yeah, I had the laptop out and then I clicked on a thing and there was like a file name that a huge Doctor Strange fan recognized as a character from that universe, went to the, that's how it leaked, that I did no work on Doctor Strange at all.
6288000	6289000	Otherwise, I would have been credited.
6289000	6290000	I didn't do, I didn't help them at all.
6290000	6292000	I went in there and it was like, Doctor Strange is neat.
6292000	6294000	All right.
6294000	6298000	All right, all right.
6298000	6301000	Give him, give him your three, your three rules.
6301000	6305000	Your three never is, or your three always is for a writer.
6305000	6306000	All right.
6306000	6308000	You prove that you suck.
6308000	6309000	Done.
6309000	6311000	Because you, because you're worried about that.
6311000	6316000	So if you, if you, if you sit and you try to prove that you're good, what will you write?
6316000	6317000	You'll write nothing.
6317000	6319000	If you try to prove that you'll suck, what will you write?
6319000	6320000	You'll write everything.
6320000	6322000	You'll write the first thing I've done in your head.
6322000	6323000	Poopy do.
6323000	6324000	I wrote something.
6324000	6328000	I wrote a thousand percent more than the guy whose goal was to write something good.
6328000	6329000	Just that.
6329000	6333000	It's a, it's a dramatic rendition of Scooby Doo.
6333000	6338000	It's kind of, it's set in a, in a post-war Czechoslovakia.
6338000	6341000	It's about a dog who, no sir.
6341000	6343000	Right from start to finish.
6343000	6344000	I don't know where that's going.
6344000	6345000	Kenny.
6345000	6346000	Yes.
6346000	6349000	Right, right from, right from start to finish, right in, in passes.
6349000	6354000	So you go fade it into your Poopy Doo's house.
6354000	6358000	Poopy Doo is making tea.
6358000	6361000	A wizard steals it.
6361000	6365000	Poopy Doo chases him.
6365000	6374000	Don't now start at the top and go, Poopy Doo is making chamomile tea.
6374000	6378000	A wizard carefully steals it.
6378000	6384000	Poopy Doo chases him on a razor scooter.
6384000	6386000	These changes are not going to help you.
6386000	6388000	You just made it better.
6388000	6390000	That's what you think.
6390000	6391000	But guess what happens?
6391000	6392000	Then you cut to.
6392000	6393000	You got to hit.
6393000	6398000	Exterior streets of San Francisco.
6398000	6399000	The TV show?
6399000	6402000	An elaborate chase.
6402000	6408000	Poopy Doo hits the wizard with a car.
6408000	6418000	He picks up his stolen tea and looks at the camera.
6418000	6421000	Poopy Doo.
6421000	6423000	That's a wrap.
6423000	6426000	Tea style.
6426000	6428000	And then you fade out.
6428000	6431000	So I finished my draft now.
6431000	6435000	Now I can go back and change the tea and all this stuff.
6435000	6438000	If I do that after I finish the first scene,
6438000	6441000	then I go to the second scene and it's like I realize,
6441000	6443000	oh, streets of San Francisco.
6443000	6446000	Wait, I should, like, this sucks.
6446000	6448000	I should fade in on San Francisco.
6448000	6451000	This whole scene is going to get cut or changed so dramatically.
6451000	6453000	All of my thought about what kind of tea it should be
6453000	6456000	and how the wizard steals it is going to,
6456000	6459000	all of that time is just going to be wasted, basically.
6459000	6462000	So it's like, even though it's totally counterintuitive
6462000	6464000	because you're a perfectionist,
6464000	6466000	you want to always, when you sit down to your document,
6466000	6469000	your work in progress, you want to, and I always do it.
6469000	6471000	Do as I say, not as I do.
6471000	6474000	I never followed this fucking advice in my goddamn life.
6474000	6478000	Start at the, don't start at the top of the document.
6478000	6482000	Erase the interior of Poopy Doo's house and to the cut to it.
6482000	6485000	Just fade in and then the first thing we see is
6485000	6487000	Exterior Street to San Francisco.
6487000	6491000	Well, this is my, now we're on to how to receive notes.
6494000	6496000	So you're going to be collaborating, you're going to be developing.
6496000	6497000	Can it be Atlanta?
6497000	6499000	We get so many tax breaks that we shoot in Atlanta.
6499000	6502000	Wait, what are you talking, what are you talking, what are you saying?
6502000	6504000	If you start there, fade in.
6504000	6505000	Street to San Francisco.
6505000	6506000	This is an elaborate chase.
6506000	6507000	Oh, yeah.
6507000	6508000	Poopy Doo is a wizard.
6508000	6510000	Yeah.
6510000	6511000	Exactly.
6512000	6516000	That's a fucking good, that's a cold open par excellence.
6516000	6517000	Yes.
6517000	6520000	And you might, and hey, you might be one of these people.
6520000	6531000	You go like, you know, it's a cut to, you know, title three weeks earlier.
6531000	6534000	And then you fucking even get to use this scene.
6534000	6538000	You just move it down to here.
6538000	6541000	See if I can, there you go.
6541000	6542000	Yeah.
6542000	6544000	Fade in on a cut to.
6544000	6545000	Fade in.
6545000	6546000	Yeah.
6546000	6547000	Title three weeks earlier.
6547000	6548000	Oh shit, man.
6548000	6549000	This fucking thing.
6549000	6552000	This just became a John Wick.
6555000	6556000	This shit is hot now.
6556000	6558000	This is like on the blacklist.
6560000	6563000	Anyways, so yeah.
6563000	6564000	Okay.
6564000	6565000	So prove that you suck.
6565000	6566000	Write a shitty draft.
6566000	6569000	Write it all the way through before you start second guessing it.
6569000	6571000	Because you'll make discoveries along the way.
6571000	6574000	And I guess the third thing is like, oh shit.
6574000	6575000	What the fuck?
6575000	6576000	Oh, I thought there was.
6577000	6578000	Don't do that.
6578000	6580000	I thought there was like a Huntsman behind it.
6582000	6583000	Dan, don't move.
6584000	6585000	Don't move.
6585000	6586000	Don't look up.
6586000	6587000	No, come on.
6588000	6589000	I don't want to don't.
6589000	6590000	It's not funny, is it?
6592000	6595000	The what is the third thing?
6595000	6598000	You know, that's what you know, kind of works.
6598000	6602000	Like it's like, it's like, yeah, like don't like you don't separate yourself
6602000	6604000	from what is going on.
6604000	6607000	If you're working in advertising and somebody's saying, I want you to write me
6607000	6610000	the best Pepsi commercial in the world, like, and you happen to be going
6610000	6614000	through a divorce or a custody battle with children, like, and that's all you
6614000	6619000	can think about is like how much it hurts to like lose talking about something
6619000	6622000	as if it's a commodity, even though it's your child and you feel you hate
6622000	6625000	yourself or you're vigilant against injustice.
6625000	6628000	You got to put that into your Pepsi commercial or your bad Pepsi commercial
6628000	6631000	writer and no one's going to buy Pepsi from your commercial.
6631000	6636000	Or you got to go, you got to tell Pepsi, I can't write this commercial right now.
6636000	6637000	It's all an autobiography.
6637000	6638000	It's all meta.
6638000	6639000	It's all personal.
6639000	6640000	Write what you know.
6640000	6641000	That's what that means.
6641000	6644000	It doesn't mean, oh, you know what people are really interested in is your life
6644000	6645000	as an oceanographer.
6645000	6647000	They don't give a fuck, but they did.
6647000	6649000	They want to feel sincere writing.
6649000	6651000	They want you to like, they don't want it.
6651000	6655000	They could, if they wanted to read something by somebody who was trying to
6655000	6658000	make a TV show, they could write their own shit and do it.
6658000	6662000	They'd be like, just fade in on some fucking asshole trying to write a script.
6662000	6669000	Like, they're counting on you to lower that compartment between Kenny the
6669000	6674000	physicist and Kenny the writer, not for you to stop being a physicist and start
6674000	6675000	being a writer.
6675000	6676000	This shit is dumb.
6676000	6680000	Like, illiterates can buy Final Draft and write, use the software.
6680000	6685000	You need to be like, write a shitty draft and just be like, fade in on fucking
6685000	6687000	what physics fucking bumming me out.
6687000	6688000	I don't know.
6688000	6691000	Maybe your voice will be different, but.
6691000	6693000	Surprisingly, no.
6693000	6696000	There's something, there's something, when you get really honest with yourself,
6696000	6700000	there's something about your life that you've, where you've come from, like,
6700000	6702000	that it's just your map of the cosmos.
6702000	6707000	Don't, you're not trying to like, tell other people what to think or prove that
6707000	6712000	you're interesting or cool or that you like them or that they should like you.
6712000	6717000	Like, pretend your goal is, some alien came down and put a laser gun in your
6717000	6725000	head and said, you have to show me in the next day with a document, like, how you
6725000	6727000	saw the world, period.
6727000	6730000	Like, or I'm going to blow your brains out with this alien gun and it's going to
6730000	6731000	hurt extra bad.
6731000	6732000	It's not going to be a painless death.
6732000	6734000	Surprisingly common theme in my dreams.
6735000	6736000	Yeah.
6738000	6739000	Yeah.
6739000	6743000	Just, your goal is to like, is to just say, I was here.
6743000	6744000	This is what happened to me.
6744000	6747000	The more brutally honest you are, the more you'll get close to being like,
6747000	6748000	Woody Allen, Lena Dunham or something.
6748000	6750000	Like, they don't, they don't moralize.
6750000	6755000	They're narcissistic and they look at their shit and this is what I had for
6755000	6758000	breakfast and then this is who I slept with and this is what I thought as I was
6758000	6761000	sleeping with them and these people are geniuses when they do it right.
6761000	6764000	That's really one of the things I really loved about Great Minds.
6764000	6769000	Like, you going through what you were at the time that that was being done.
6769000	6772000	You could see all of that pouring out and maybe like, random people on YouTube
6772000	6775000	just stumbling across it might not, but people who are religious like,
6775000	6779000	Harman Town listeners will know like, some of the little like, ticks you have
6779000	6780000	and all the little things you mentioned.
6780000	6783000	Like, that's all callbacks to things about yourself that you're like, being
6783000	6785000	honest about and I think that's what people really love about your writing.
6785000	6787000	Like, you just come through.
6787000	6789000	Yeah, it's my little bag of tricks.
6789000	6790000	Yeah.
6790000	6792000	And it can be yours too because it'll be different when you do it.
6792000	6794000	Like, just reaching into your own shit.
6794000	6799000	As a friend of ours, Sam Christensen said, he was an awesome mentor.
6799000	6802000	He said, remember my name and stop drinking.
6807000	6812000	As our old friend, Sam Christensen said,
6812000	6816000	he said, listen, I want you to do two things.
6816000	6819000	Never forget my name.
6819000	6823000	And please, for the love of God, will you have a cup of coffee?
6825000	6827000	Fuck you.
6827000	6829000	Judas.
6833000	6835000	That's high-roading from the low road.
6835000	6837000	I know.
6837000	6841000	As he puts his face into the ice bucket.
6841000	6844000	We all pay a huge price tag for where we are.
6844000	6847000	Like, life comes with a price.
6847000	6850000	And as artists, we get to cash in on that.
6850000	6856000	Like, our job is to show the world what we went through to make us us.
6856000	6859000	That's the beauty of art.
6859000	6864000	I tried as hard as I could to not be distracting.
6866000	6868000	And it was funny because it was.
6868000	6871000	Have you ever tried to put ice in a glass?
6871000	6873000	We have to end the show in a couple minutes.
6873000	6874000	What? Really?
6874000	6875000	Yeah.
6875000	6876000	I'm proud of us.
6877000	6879000	We have a heart out in like three minutes.
6879000	6880000	Oh, shit.
6880000	6883000	Oh, man, what was this Spalding Grey shit?
6883000	6885000	I thought it was very valuable.
6885000	6888000	So much so that I apparently got a little drunk.
6890000	6894000	You poured him a vodka and I drank it because I'm a conservationist.
6896000	6898000	Which is another word for alcohol.
6898000	6900000	I was just connecting dots for logical humor.
6900000	6902000	Kenny, how do you think the show went?
6902000	6905000	How much did the tickets cost?
6905000	6906000	Fuck, I don't know.
6906000	6909000	That was a non-committal answer.
6909000	6911000	I feel like it went pretty good.
6911000	6913000	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
6918000	6922000	I think it went great until the part where I came up and that's just my thing.
6922000	6924000	Right, but you wanted that to happen.
6924000	6926000	Sure, yes, yes.
6926000	6929000	I brought that upon myself and all of you, so that's fine.
6929000	6932000	I feel like this is like episode five or six of Cobra Man.
6933000	6936000	We had no women up here.
6936000	6940000	If somebody's watching the show, they don't know that women exist in Sydney.
6940000	6944000	But, you know, you've got two women on tomorrow night.
6944000	6946000	Yeah, we'll get two women on tomorrow night.
6946000	6947000	I'll just dress up.
6947000	6948000	I'll wear a dress.
6948000	6950000	We'll make it ladies' night tomorrow night, yeah.
6950000	6953000	We'll enforce dichotomy.
6954000	6957000	We'll make people understand there's a difference between you and you.
6957000	6960000	It's been a few minutes since we said we have to end the show in a few minutes.
6961000	6962000	All right, well, is it me?
6962000	6965000	I mean, look, look, rapping is the hardest work I do.
6970000	6976000	Now, Jim, here to increase the danger of this, my iPad is at three percent,
6976000	6978000	so we have to fucking get this right.
6981000	6983000	He's got his Crocodile Dundee hat on.
6983000	6985000	Wait a minute.
6985000	6987000	This isn't a mic.
6987000	6989000	Spencer, can I get your beat?
6991000	6992000	Okay.
6992000	6994000	That was a mic.
6994000	6996000	That was a mic.
6996000	6997000	All right.
6997000	6999000	So, to save the day here, Spencer's going to get...
6999000	7003000	We're pulling a beat off of Spencer's deep bag of beats.
7005000	7006000	Bag of beats.
7006000	7008000	Dan's already getting the kicky baby dance going.
7016000	7017000	Oi.
7017000	7019000	Energizer.
7020000	7021000	Struth.
7021000	7022000	True Blue.
7022000	7024000	Fair Dinkum.
7025000	7028000	But make it real, because we went to a dark place there.
7028000	7030000	Prove what you just told Kenny right now.
7035000	7037000	I'll do notes after.
7037000	7038000	Give it to him, Dan.
7038000	7039000	Australia.
7039000	7042000	T-R-A-L-I-A.
7042000	7044000	Australia.
7044000	7048000	I'm here to tell you, it's an island that's filled with fillets.
7049000	7050000	Paraffinalia.
7050000	7051000	Fuck.
7051000	7052000	All right.
7052000	7053000	Starting over.
7053000	7054000	Starting over.
7054000	7055000	All right.
7055000	7056000	I thought I could make up a word.
7056000	7057000	All right.
7057000	7058000	All right.
7058000	7059000	All right.
7059000	7060000	Okay.
7060000	7061000	Phew.
7061000	7062000	Walk it off.
7062000	7063000	Walk it off.
7063000	7064000	All right.
7064000	7065000	Hold up.
7065000	7066000	Hold up.
7066000	7067000	Hold up.
7067000	7069000	What are you...
7069000	7071000	Paraffinalia.
7071000	7073000	Paraffinalia.
7080000	7082000	Australia.
7082000	7083000	Yeah.
7083000	7084000	Yeah.
7084000	7085000	genitalia.
7085000	7086000	Okay.
7086000	7087000	All right.
7087000	7088000	Everybody's better than me.
7088000	7089000	Yeah.
7089000	7090000	Yeah.
7090000	7091000	Yeah.
7091000	7092000	Yeah.
7092000	7093000	Yeah.
7093000	7094000	Down under.
7094000	7095000	Only rhymes with thunder.
7095000	7096000	We've been over that.
7096000	7097000	I'm not trying to blunder.
7097000	7098000	Through my rap.
7098000	7099000	I'm done with that crap.
7099000	7102000	I'm going to blow from the soul and do it like that.
7102000	7103000	Like this.
7103000	7104000	And like that over there.
7104000	7107000	I fucked your mama so hard, I ruined her hair.
7108000	7110000	She had to get it cut the next day.
7110000	7113000	She did a thing with layers and the bangs were okay.
7114000	7116000	Then she wore some rim glasses.
7116000	7117000	All glasses have rims.
7117000	7118000	Sorry.
7124000	7125000	Australia.
7125000	7126000	Land down under.
7126000	7127000	Sydney.
7127000	7128000	Cap.
7128000	7129000	Not the capital.
7130000	7131000	What is the capital?
7134000	7135000	Cameron.
7138000	7139000	Cameron.
7140000	7143000	Cameron, the capital of Australia.
7145000	7146000	Sydney.
7146000	7148000	A land of a thousand people.
7148000	7152000	Don't worry about the steeple.
7152000	7153000	Give me a second.
7153000	7154000	Give me a second.
7154000	7155000	Yeah.
7155000	7157000	There's only a thousand people in Sydney.
7157000	7159000	It's the land of 1000 people.
7162000	7163000	Give me a second.
7163000	7164000	All right.
7164000	7165000	Work it out.
7165000	7166000	Yeah.
7166000	7167000	Here's the planet.
7167000	7169000	And here's seven continents.
7169000	7172000	And here's the little one down here that I must defend.
7172000	7174000	It's a big ball of people.
7174000	7175000	It's such a good place.
7175000	7177000	Why would I use the word people again?
7179000	7180000	All right.
7180000	7181000	Here we go.
7181000	7182000	Here we go.
7182000	7183000	Here we go.
7183000	7184000	Country to country.
7184000	7185000	Each country has the most.
7185000	7188000	But there's only one country that's made entirely of coast.
7192000	7194000	It's the opposite of landlocked.
7194000	7196000	That means it's the opposite of Germany.
7196000	7198000	That means we don't have to worry about them invading me.
7199000	7200000	Ever.
7200000	7201000	In the future.
7201000	7202000	They're good people down here.
7202000	7203000	The doctors have sutures.
7203000	7206000	They stitch you up and send you on your way.
7206000	7209000	I fucked your mama so hard her curds turned away.
7210000	7211000	Little Miss Muppet.
7211000	7213000	Dangerous poisonous spiders.
7213000	7214000	I'm done with it.
7214000	7216000	I don't want to see nothing with eight legs.
7216000	7219000	I fucked your mama so hard she had to beg for more.
7219000	7223000	She said give me some vitamin D to the A to the N.
7223000	7224000	You know that's what I need.
7224000	7227000	To the H to the A-R-M-O-N.
7227000	7228000	I fucked your mama twice.
7228000	7229000	Fucked her again.
7231000	7233000	Thank you for coming to Harmon Town everybody.
7234000	7238000	Sorry if you're a woman or a mother.
7238000	7239000	Thank you Sydney Opera House.
7240000	7242000	Thank you Sydney Opera House.
7244000	7246000	We're doing another show tomorrow night.
7246000	7247000	We love you.
7247000	7248000	Come on.
7248000	7249000	Let's hear it for Kenny everybody.
7249000	7250000	Kenny!
7251000	7252000	Ryan.
7253000	7254000	Ryan Loranier.
7256000	7258000	Spencer Crittenden.
7261000	7263000	I'm your comptroller Jeff Davis.
7263000	7265000	Your mayor of course is Dan Harmon.
7272000	7275000	Let's all go to a bar together and continue this shall we?
7277000	7279000	Try fast. Take chances. We love you.
7282000	7283000	We love you.
7294000	7295000	Did you get any of that?
7296000	7298000	It's a cool show.
