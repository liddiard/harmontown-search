0	26160	Good evening. Welcome to the historic episode number 73 of Harman Town. Episode 73, please
26160	37200	welcome to the stage, your mayor, Mr. Dan Harman. Hello, thank you.
37200	49280	Guest Comptroller, Erin McGathey. How are you doing? How did it go, starting the
49280	53560	show? I think it went okay. Okay. I got some encouragement from the front row.
53560	59320	Oh yeah? What did they do? Shouldn't you? Yeah, I mean before the show they were like,
59320	64560	oh hey, hi, how's it going? The second row was like, fuck you. They're all holding it, giving me thumbs
64560	68800	downs, shaking their heads back and forth. Thanks for coming on Emmy night and
68800	77760	Breaking Bad night. We appreciate it. I'm back. I got an iPhone. I'm back. So I'm
77760	81960	not wearing my eye Harman tonight, which is my notepad that I've been using, only
81960	85560	because I'm gonna give it a field test. I'm gonna give Evernote another week.
85560	89520	I'm gonna see if Evernote works for keeping track of stuff, which so far it
89520	94000	does not. It doesn't work. But I did just use my fingerprint to open my phone and
94000	99640	that's that's disturbing. They say that the fingerprint is stored on the chip
99640	103360	inside the phone and that will never therefore be accessible to the National
103360	110320	Security Agency. It's already been hacked. Yeah, it's in a chip on a phone.
110320	116920	I was never a part of the of the vote where they said, hey,
116920	120240	we're gonna give everything but the things in the chips on the phone to the
120240	124120	National Security Agency. I was never a part of that. I'm sure they would have
124120	130120	said that was okay too, right? Sure. We're putting it in the iCloud. The cloud has a
130120	135120	border around it. Dan, how long do you think it'll be before a jealous boyfriend
135120	141440	or girlfriend cuts off their partner's thumb? Oh, and uses it to unlock their
141440	145320	phone. Yeah. Well, there's definitely gonna be a lot of like sleepy up, passed
145320	153240	out sleeping, use your phone. Just lifting a limp hand up. Yeah, well,
153240	157400	people cut off penises and stuff. So like, of course, they're gonna
157400	160920	definitely, you go through people's purses. Like, you know, if you're in an
160920	164320	unhealthy relationship, you're yelling at each other and then you get drunk and
164520	168880	then you pass out that someone's gonna use the phone, the thumb to yeah, for
168880	172480	sure. Well, I feel like people justify a lot of bad behaviors, whereas like
172480	175240	breaking into their partner's phone, like, oh, yeah, I was checking the thing
175240	178680	and then I came across this, like, it's pretty hard to get around the thumbprint
178680	185440	thing. It's an obvious thing. This has been thumbprint talk. Yeah. I just had
185440	188800	the air taken out of the thing I really wanted to talk about tonight, which is
189040	192120	something that Duncan Trussell told me earlier tonight, which is that the first
192120	196120	cybernetic cyborg hate crime happened at a French McDonald's, but it happened
196120	201760	like two years ago, like July of 2012. And there was a guy in a French
201760	206680	McDonald's that had a cybernetic eye. And yeah, people were like, take off that
206920	214080	camera. And he was like, it's my eye bolted to my skull. I'm a cyborg. And it
214080	219080	was, he was a cyborg. And, and they tried to rip it off like a kid, like, like, you
219080	223680	know, like in a, you know, in a comedic, like, take off that beard, you're in
223680	229000	disguise. And it's like, ow, I'm Santa Claus. Except they tried to rip his eye out
229000	233680	of his head. Ostensibly, because they're French, I guess, and they're like, both
233680	238400	more passionate and have less technology. Because I'm sure this guy had to be
238400	243960	either Canadian or American, right? He's got a robot eye. And yeah, they tried to
243960	247200	rip his eye out of his head. And people were calling it the first cyborg hate
247200	252400	crime. But it happened a year ago. So who cares? And I looked it up and it wasn't
252400	255600	like you have a picture in your head of like a, like a cyborg eye, like a
255600	260880	terminator. He's got like a, it's like a Google half of a Google glasses bolted
260880	265920	to his head. He's the one who chose to bolt it. Like you could easily just wear
265920	269320	it or make it rip off a bull. I'm just saying it's just when you look at it,
269320	278960	you're kind of like, yeah, take it off. It's kind of like a fedora hood. It was like, no, I have a really
278960	283640	tingly scalp, so I staple my hat to my head. And they said no hats in here. They
283640	287600	tried to rip it off and it rips my skin off. It's like, yikes, that's
287600	293760	terrible. But nothing, but nothing. I mean, I wasn't gonna say he deserves it.
293760	299760	Got a camera bolted to his head. Don't rip it off. But anyways, I just want to talk
299760	302960	about how disappointing it is to find out in the green room that that happened a
302960	306680	year ago. Are you gonna talk to Duncan about it? Yeah, I'm gonna text him and
306680	312640	say, yeah, thanks for the scoop, jackass. First cyborg hate crime. I'm gonna, I'm
312640	317800	gonna go put a camera in his head. All right, so let's just review some things.
318160	322240	Mm-hmm. So we had a good, good Saturday yesterday. Yeah.
322240	328440	Harmon and McGathey style. Bed Springer. Yeah, yeah. I definitely got out of bed today.
328440	333520	Absolutely because I wanted to. Yeah. Like I was, there was nothing left to do in bed.
333520	338120	I absolutely reached my limit as I was waking up to the credits of how to
338120	341440	succeed in business without really trying at 5 a.m. I was like, it is time
341440	346960	to get out of bed. Yeah, yesterday we watched Super 8 In Time with Justin
346960	355160	Timberlake. A little bit of the host. Just a little bit of the Twilight
355160	361160	Ladies Alien movie. Branded. Tried to watch a little bit of branded. Batman and
361160	367200	Robin and Batman Forever. And yeah, how to succeed in business without really
367200	370400	trying. But we, what we didn't get around to watching is something I'm kind of
370400	373480	excited about because of the iTunes description. It's called The Dinosaur
373480	380400	Project. It's on iTunes and the iTunes description is, Dinosaur Project is a
380400	384760	team of explorers searching for a mythical creature. What mythical
384760	392160	creature? When their helicopter is brought down by a flock of enormous birds,
392160	397040	they discover strange creatures which civilization has thought extinct for
397040	404520	millions of years. Dinosaurs are the title. And describe the art on the cover of the
404520	409560	movie. I don't know if I can. Well, it's people running from dinosaurs.
409560	414120	Giant dinosaurs. Identifiable dinosaur project. But the summary of it, they're
414120	419600	really trying to skirt the, like, let's make this a bigger deal. Yeah, that
419600	424280	there are creatures that no one's aware of. But I'm getting tapped because I
424280	427400	know, you know, this is one of those nights I'm telling you. I got nothing. I
427400	436720	got nothing to talk about. And you're here and... What? Oh, you weren't crazy about
436720	442040	Super 8. I like the first half hour of it and then, you know, as it slowly
442040	448520	became a movie about a spider monster. Okay, I wasn't trying to throw you under
448520	452160	the bus. I didn't think it was, it was really funny watching Dan. I've seen the
452160	454640	movie before, watching Dan watch that movie, just be like, oh, it's just a
454640	458400	spider monster. And you learn that Dan's experience of watching Super 8 was just
458400	462720	like, oh, I can't see, I can't wait to see what bizarre new monster it is. The payoff.
462720	468280	The payoff. Super payoff. Super payoff. If your movie's about a spider
468280	475200	monster, and it's CG, you can just show it crawling out of a thing and
475200	479120	reveal it and then tell a story about dealing with it. You don't have to hide
479120	485200	it from me. That doesn't make it magical. You can't tell me it's magical.
485200	490680	That's not fair. That's not fair. It's not magical just because you don't show it.
490680	495880	That's not, it's not a magical creature. It's a spider monster. It's from, from,
495880	500400	from Mars and it wants to go back home. And I would like to see the spider
500400	504560	monster as early as possible and I'd like to learn what makes it tick and, and
504560	508360	then get on with the story of the spider monster. I do not want to hear the three
508360	513720	hour story of what's that and have the third act be, it's a spider monster.
513720	520840	Just very well shot. Very, very beautiful film. It's about a spider monster and
520840	525480	there's just, there's no covering that up these days. I got a cyborg eye called
525480	533800	Apple TV. I can rewind. I know it's a spider monster. All right. Our next guest,
533800	543560	waited in line for 12 hours to buy my new iPhone for me and didn't get his own,
543560	547960	which I wanted to buy him in exchange for him doing that. His name is Spencer
547960	559640	Crittenden. You can go, do you want to be a guest for a change? Do you want to sit
559640	569160	and, oh boy, man, that question just, just overloaded him. He's taking
569160	574080	dungeon master's seat. There's, there's, there's three chairs up there. Yeah. Two
574080	579320	microphones. So you, thanks for, thanks for waiting in line for me the night
579320	583560	before the iPhone came out. I'm still kind of out of it. Yeah. Did it throw out
583560	590280	your schedule a little bit? Yeah. Yeah. A little. Whoa. Whoa. A little. But I mean, I, I
590280	596840	didn't sleep and then I slept and now I'm okay kind of. That's how it works.
596840	602280	How did, how did, how did, how does waiting in line to buy an iPhone work?
602280	608160	That's something I don't know. It's, it's kind of boring. Like I'm not, I'm not
608160	613880	sociable. So I got there and I didn't really talk to anybody, but other people
613880	618640	were talking to people around me and that was great. What were those people like?
618640	622440	What were the people? Yeah. The people around you. What were the conversations?
622440	629400	What was the scene? About being cold and whether or not the bathrooms are working.
629400	635200	Where were the bathrooms? They were, you know, around. It was an, it was an outdoor
635200	640680	mall. There were, there's two kinds of bathrooms. They were both locked at some
640680	645040	point. Well, this is, these are the, these are the details of people that I want. I
645040	649240	don't know about. Yeah. I want to know you're out on the sidewalk. Uh-huh. You're
649240	654680	outside an Apple store. Yeah. Sitting in a camp chair. You brought a chair. I, yeah,
654680	659800	you, you gotta, yeah, you gotta bring a chair. So where do you, where do you make
659800	665240	the peepees? In the bathroom. So which one, which, who's bathroom? That's the mall
665240	670080	bathroom. It's public. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. You go up these stairs and then there's
670080	674320	a bathroom and I went and there was a guy out there and he was like, don't go in the
674320	678560	bathroom, man. And I was like, what? And he was like, it's all dark. I couldn't find
678560	685840	the light. And I was like, oh, well, I mean, I peed in the dark before. Also, how dare
685840	692320	he slap his limitations on you like that. I couldn't find the light switch. Everyone,
692320	696380	everyone stopped eliminating. Yeah. And I was like, just don't, just don't follow me
696380	701280	in there. And I just went in there and, uh, you know, my iPhone has a flashlight function.
701280	707560	Yeah. Very funny that a guy in line for new technology was like, dark. Yeah. Well, that
707560	711640	was, yeah, that would be a, that's, that's the point of being an Apple guy is, yeah,
711640	715040	you want Apple takes care of that. I'm like, Apple, turn the lights off. I don't know what
715040	720160	to do. Um, the, uh, so wait, he didn't want you to follow him into the bathroom. No,
720160	724720	I told him not to follow me because he's a weird guy telling people about stuff going
724720	731440	on. You said, don't follow me to someone. Yeah. You were saying I'm going to go check
731440	736240	this out. Yeah. Well, he was, he was presumably out of the bathroom having gone in there and
736240	740960	I was going in there in spite of his warning. So he might be like, Oh, what's all the fuss
740960	745760	about? Or he might be like, I'm going to murder that guy. I mean, I'm not, who am I to judge,
745760	750160	but don't follow me in there. Seemed to be fair. Can you, can you describe this bathtown
750160	758160	bath bathroom crier? Um, he was, he was a Mexican guy with a short, uh, spiky hair. He, uh, maybe
758160	763360	five foot four. Fine. You know, are you not using any kind of race because you're not racist?
764320	767680	Oh, okay. Definitely. I didn't hear it because I'm not racist. Nice.
768240	777600	Yeah. Uh, uh, so, uh, okay. So you tie a tiny, tiny man. Yeah. Five, four, pretty small. Yeah.
777600	780480	Sorry. If you're in the audience and you're five four and you don't like being called tiny.
782640	788560	Uh, so definitely compared to you, a tiny, tiny little man. Yeah. Don't, don't go in the bathroom.
788560	794480	I can't find the light. And you said, okay, don't follow me. Yeah. And went into the bathroom
794480	798960	and found the light or just use your iPhone as a, I was like, I'll take my chances. And then he
798960	803360	was like, well, I mean, I looked all around. It's really, really dark in there. And I was like,
803360	814160	I'll be fine. Just don't, don't come in there. Oh man. Something happened with that guy and his
814160	817760	mom at a certain point, something, something where he, he went into the room and he's like,
817760	822160	mom, like the lights out. And she came in and turned the light on and beat him with a hammer.
822560	831920	Just with a lamp. With a lamp. Better. So he loves and hates light. So, so the,
831920	838960	was he a fellow Apple liner? I think he was. Yeah. That was at about, uh, two 30 in the morning. I
838960	843920	think most people out where that there was, uh, you know, some security guards and cops rolling
843920	847920	around. But other than that, it was just Apple people. And was he, was he waiting for you when
847920	852640	you came out? Did you say that already? He was still there. He hadn't moved. I went pretty fast.
852640	860320	I was, you know, ready to defend myself. So yeah, he was still there. Yeah. Waiting outside the
860320	865280	bathroom. Not waiting outside. He was, there's like a kind of area that's like a balcony over
865280	871920	these stairs. Cause you gotta go upstairs. So it's like, he was at a balcony overlooking this place
871920	878080	when he, you know, told me of the bathroom's lights. Yeah. And, um, so yeah. And he just stayed
878080	883440	there and watched you go to the bathroom and come back out present. Yeah. I'm not sure. I don't,
883440	888720	I don't think of it like that, but who saved your place in line when you were using the bathroom?
888720	893680	No one. I had my chair there. So a lot of people, once they had chairs going on, they were getting
893680	901280	up and leaving and coming back. Sort of an honor system, but how, how, how, how much, how, how much
901280	904880	are you allowed to stretch that? How much did you see it stretched? Like the idea of just putting a
904880	908960	chair there and just taking off the person who was like the fifth in line was bullshit. It was just
908960	914640	some old lady and, um, she just put a chair down and fucking went home and watched, uh, she went
914640	920080	down for four, she left for four hours, came back for a half hour, left for about seven hours, came
920080	925920	back two minutes or two hours before, uh, opening. But other than that, wasn't there at all. So like
925920	930800	most of the time she wasn't even there. So that was kind of bullshit. Yeah. That's interesting. This
930880	936560	concept. Here's a, this is the other thing that haunts me. If you had not waited in line for me,
936560	941440	so I can have my precious iPhone the next day, how long would it have taken? Was there a line
941440	948640	the next day? Like they would have been sold out the next day of most stuff, especially that,
948640	954880	that model. So the night, the night that you spent in a lawn chair on a sidewalk earned me
955600	960960	what, how many days with an iPhone that I wouldn't have had. I mean, six to seven, six to seven. All
960960	968080	right. Spencer. All right. All right. Dan Harmon too for not abusing his employees.
970800	978320	Six. I got seven days out of, uh, out of one of, out of his 12 hours. Pretty good. I felt bad. I told
978400	984480	him to get himself one. And then he couldn't because he was an Apple employee. Yeah. I had an
984480	990320	employee account, um, that gave me like a cheap bill, but as a result, I was like locked onto
990320	996400	bullshit and, um, I, you know, stopped being an employee, but I guess I didn't stop having a plan.
996400	1000400	So I couldn't get a phone. So it was more about your phone plan than your, than the Apple.
1001120	1006400	Yeah. Well, I got the phone plan because of Apple, but it was the phone plans lockedness.
1007360	1014160	It was just bureaucracies. All right. All right. Oh my gosh. You know what time it is?
1014880	1017120	It's McGathey game corner time.
1023200	1030480	All right. All right. Welcome to McGathey's, uh, game corner. Uh, we'll do, uh,
1030560	1032480	Spencer, you want to play? Oh yeah.
1034720	1041120	Can anyone else play? Like, like, like, uh, is it how many people can play? Uh, are we, uh,
1041120	1045760	we could have one more person, but only if maybe he's created something with you in the past.
1045760	1050080	Maybe only if you've been, is that what I was thinking? Yeah. But I don't want to,
1050080	1052800	I don't know what your game is. So I don't want, am I ruining it? Is there
1052800	1054800	a
1065920	1070560	can I confess something that I just realized as I sat down, I didn't realize consciously,
1070560	1073840	I was doing this or I would have been honest about it that what went through my head was
1073840	1078240	if there was someone else up here, according to the format of the show, I get to sit down.
1078960	1083600	The format of the show being me doing whatever I want. So I could have sat down.
1085360	1089600	Yeah, I could roll out here on a surfboard. You can lay down kittens pulling it. Yeah.
1090160	1096320	Uh, anyways, thank you. How are you doing, Rob? I'm doing good. Good, good, good, good.
1097920	1104320	Uh, I just saw this, uh, insidious chapter two. You ever, uh, you ever see that? No.
1104480	1108240	Anybody see this insidious chapter two? What's insidious one?
1109120	1112480	That's like, uh, that's one of those, that's one of those kids paranormal movies, right?
1112480	1117520	Yeah. Yeah. The first one is not too bad. I actually, is it another with the camera and
1117520	1120960	everybody? No, no, no, no, no. Well, there's camera, there's, there were cameras involved.
1122480	1126800	That's why I got to see it. Well, in our day there were always cameras involved,
1126800	1131840	but there was craftsmanship too. You didn't just, you didn't just put one of these things on a
1131840	1139440	dresser and say, oh boy, I'm Citizen Kane now. I didn't like it. I know that felt like a setup
1139440	1145440	that I was going to start like doing like 15 minutes on why insidious two was bad, but I just
1145440	1149920	wanted to say I didn't like it and we can get on with the game. Did you, did you see it? Did you
1149920	1154640	see it in the theater? I saw it with Steve Agee in the theater, in the theater. Yes. Yeah. Were
1154640	1160720	you like seeing a movie with Steve Agee? What's it like? Yeah. He leans forward a lot, which is kind
1160720	1168080	of, you know, cause I, I'll sit and crouch, but he'll like lean forward a lot. That's weird.
1168640	1173280	I think it's cause he's really tall. I think it's because, yeah, he has anxiety about being
1173280	1179280	a tall guy. I have that. We saw the conjuring together. It was, which was really good. I really
1179280	1183040	liked that. I thought it was a, like had some heightened moments. What did you see? What?
1183040	1188720	The conjuring? The conjuring. It's another movie. Yeah. Is that about some kind of wizard or
1188720	1194800	something? No, no. Is that like a Harry Potter thing? No, no, no, no, no. It was like Ron- Is that
1194800	1202400	one of those Hogwarts? No, no, no, no, no, no. Keep, keep going. Keep going. No, no. It was,
1202400	1208720	it was this thing. It started Ron Livingston and the guy that played Owlman from Watchmen that
1208720	1213120	looks like Rob Hubel. Right, right. Yeah. Rob Hubel from the Watchmen. Yeah. Yeah. Rob Hubel
1213120	1220960	from Watchmen. Who's also an insidious two. And I heard that Rob Hubel auditioned for Abraham
1220960	1226960	Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Wait, as Abe Lincoln or just- As Abraham Lincoln? Yeah. That'd be a
1226960	1233680	different movie, wouldn't it? I think it would go something like this. Four score and seven.
1234720	1238080	You hear that Rob Hubel? That's what you sound like. That's what you sound like, cubes.
1238640	1243440	Uh, where was I? No, we saw The Conjuring together and watching scary movies with
1243440	1249280	Agee is awesome because he's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh shit during all like the tense moment.
1249280	1252560	Yeah. It was really fun. It was fun. This movie wasn't so fun because it sucked.
1254160	1260160	Insidious two, huh? Insidious two. So what- Had you seen Insidious one? Yes, I did. Well,
1260160	1264400	what's, what's Insidious one? Give me the breakdown. Okay. Give me the goods. Insidious,
1264400	1268880	Insidious one. Give me the elevator pitch. Okay. Okay. Insidious one is- Beginning middle
1268880	1276640	end. Okay. Insidious one. 5,000 words. Wait. It basically bolted guys. All of the,
1276640	1279600	all of the slug lines. So there's each location. Give me the one sheet.
1280320	1282560	Okay. Give me the transportation budget. No, no, seriously.
1285920	1290560	It's a shot list. It's Charles from Storyboard. Give me the shipwreck comic strip of it.
1290560	1297600	Give me the novelization. Yeah. The novelization. Okay. Give me, give me just the McDonald's cups.
1297600	1304480	Okay. I can't keep up with it. No, no. Insidious one is like they're, they're, they're,
1305440	1311280	this couple, they have a kid. He goes unconscious. He doesn't come out of consciousness. They find
1311280	1318400	out that he has the ability to astral project, but got lost in this place called the further.
1318400	1323600	And the thing about when you astral project, your spirit goes out of your body, but then all
1323600	1329360	it's like your empty vessel of a body, like draws ghosts who want to. It's like,
1329360	1337440	it's like a lawn chair outside an Apple store. Yes. Yes. And, and that all that stuff was like
1337440	1343760	really good. And then, and it kind of at the end, it had some good, it had some good. It's just a
1343760	1349840	spider monster. As this turns out, it was, it was a four legged spider monster. Yeah. Interesting.
1349840	1351360	Rob, how do you think that? Called man.
1355120	1359520	It asks the question. It's a movie that asked the question, who is the real spider monster?
1362160	1367040	Isn't man just a four legged spider monster? That's what I meant. That doesn't spin webs.
1367040	1370800	That's what I meant by a four legged. I know I'm standing. I'm having fun with you.
1374720	1379680	Rob, how, how, how well do you think that prepared you for McGathey's game corner?
1380960	1389680	Very well. Yes. All right. Oh my God, guys. That was my first good sound cue ever that I've ever done.
1392080	1399360	So, uh, so Herman town attracts a variety of dynamic and interesting characters.
1399360	1406880	Stand up. One, two, three, four, so many people, uh,
1406880	1412080	dynamic, interesting people who become a part of the show a few months ago. I'm sorry.
1413920	1421280	A few months ago, uh, we, we, uh, were, were gifted with, uh, some beef jerky
1421280	1432800	from, Ooh, I heard about this. Ooh, the beef jerky. We were gifted by, uh, a man named Bill
1432800	1437920	who's sitting in the front row. That's Bill, Rob and the boxer. And Bill, why don't you jump
1437920	1443520	on the mic for this intro? Yeah. Why don't you, Bill? Just for the intro. Okay. So I'm up here
1443520	1448960	for five seconds and then I sit down, right? Yeah. Uh, well, we'll see what happens. So, uh, so,
1448960	1454400	so Bill brought some very special beef jerky from Texas from this, uh, beef jerky distributor that
1454400	1460640	he very much believes in. Did you close the Ziploc bag before you left Texas? Bill did
1460640	1465120	everything right. This was a, this was a totally like random, bad luck experience. This is beef's
1465120	1470480	fault. This is beef's fault. It's not necessarily the manufacturer's fault. It's just a random
1470480	1477520	occurrence. Things happen. Well, well, no, of course you can't. Uh, so, uh, has the game started?
1479680	1486720	So, uh, Bill passed out, Bill passed out the jerky. There was some mold on the jerky or whatever.
1486720	1491760	Anyway, okay. Someone just said there's a lot of mold on the drain. Okay. Anyway,
1493120	1497520	it doesn't matter. Anyway, Bill, since then has sat in the front row and has become part of the,
1497520	1502640	uh, the landscape that is the harm and ton audience. So we are going to play a game called
1502640	1512560	the Beef Fungus Bill Game. I, I, I, I, when you brought him up, I was reminded that he made,
1513600	1519600	you know, that he made, and we never, he made a, uh, iPad stand. Bill, obviously also he makes
1519600	1526160	this wood stuff. He made, he made quotes on little wood, uh, slats for us. Harmontown quotes,
1526160	1530800	by the way, Bill remember the quote that we thought was erroneous or whatever that said,
1530800	1536480	it wasn't somebody, I said whatever was on there that, that season two, I mean,
1536480	1540960	it was written on anus or something. Yeah. For some reason I said that, uh, probably
1540960	1545360	because I was on something else and then the Pittsburgh, but, and then also he made a dungeon
1545360	1555920	master iPad stand for, for, uh, Spencer to Dan, Dan Goldberg. What? All right. So, so Bill,
1555920	1562560	Bill is, we are, we are aware. There's more than one prototype. Uh, we are aware of Bill and Bill
1562560	1567440	is part of, uh, Harmontown, but what do we really know about Bill, you guys? I just said it all.
1568640	1574320	Right. Exactly. That's all we know. So, uh, so earlier today, Bill sent me some true facts about
1574320	1578560	himself. Oh, nice. All right. So, uh, thank you, Bill. You can go ahead and sit down. I don't
1578560	1583040	know what your face delay affects the judging, but thank you. Let's give him a really big hand.
1583760	1590560	Now, sweetie, can I ask you when Bill sent you, uh, this email with all these true facts about
1590560	1600000	himself, was that solicited or is this another situation? Oh, that's so flattering. I would be
1600000	1605280	flattered. Uh, no, it was not a situation. That was a really weird way for me to react to that.
1605280	1607600	Some guy sending you an email with a bunch of facts about himself.
1608160	1616000	I solicited. You just happened before to you. Uh, well, look at her, bro. That's very nice.
1616000	1622240	That's very nice. Happens all the time. Avoiding the question. All right. She does a podcast where
1622240	1626560	she says, Hey, I care about you. I'm Aaron McGathey. I'm your best friend. I care about
1626560	1631840	your relationships. Here's all about mine. And you know, it invites its fair share of
1631920	1639360	intimacy from strangers. I wish that it came in the, in the, in the form of just facts about
1642640	1647360	that would be, that would be fun. Um, all right. So we're going to go ahead and play this game.
1647920	1652720	There are, we have 10 questions. I'm sorry, sweetie. Can we get Rob a cup? I don't want a
1652720	1657840	cup. No, we can get you a cup. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to keep going with your
1657840	1662240	game thing. They're getting there. I saw the scramble in the back. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm not
1662240	1667200	going to interrupt anymore. I'm, I'm terribly. So have a drink Rob, but we're going to get you
1667200	1670880	a cup and you can say you can have a drink. Okay. The explanation of this game is very,
1670880	1677360	very brief. So I'm going to explain it very briefly. I have 10 questions. Uh, one in every,
1677360	1682320	every question is a, includes a true fact about bill. The other things are not true.
1683120	1687920	The three of you are going to individually, you're on your own team. You were going to decide,
1688560	1695280	what is the true bill fact? And you are allowed to discuss it with each other,
1695280	1700400	discuss it with yourself. Explain why you, uh, discuss it with yourself. Um,
1701440	1705680	decide, explain why you feel that way. So let's go, let's go ahead and, uh, let's get started.
1705680	1706880	All right. One of these is true.
1706880	1712480	We're picking the one that's true. You're picking the one that's true.
1712480	1719120	Who goes first? Uh, we'll go, we'll start. We'll do it, uh, counterclockwise and we'll start with
1719120	1727920	Spencer. I know. I just threw it out there. We'll start, we'll start with Spencer and we'll go
1727920	1733360	Spencer, Dan, Rob, as far as like who gets to, uh, give their final answer first. All right.
1733360	1741280	Question number one. Uh, one of these is real. The other two are fake. Bill spells his name
1741280	1750240	with one L because, and these are, these are quotes. A, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.
1750240	1757440	In honor of Sesame Street, two L's seems like a waste. B, it's my own little pretentious contrivance.
1757440	1761920	My father was a two L'd bill who earned both. I leave it to you to decide what that means.
1763520	1767440	C, it's my own little pretentious contrivance. I enjoy correcting people.
1770480	1775600	When I, so it's me, right? Yeah, but you guys can discuss, uh, what you. Can we have some,
1775600	1782720	can we have some thought music? Um, you can, uh, keep going. I'm not the best, uh,
1782720	1787360	DJ, but no, you can. I mean, it might be a cow farting, but I'll find something. Okay. I thought
1787360	1792800	it'd be like, I don't know. Okay. I mean, when you hear the first one, you're like,
1792800	1796880	this sounds like the real one. It sounds like it's trying to be clever, but all of them sounded
1796880	1803200	like that. I know which one it is. Oh, do you know? I mean, I, I mean, I think I know.
1803200	1807600	Tell me which one you think it is. Well, I should, is the point to, for, to, for him to.
1807600	1814160	Well, I want to win. Well, you guys have a minute of discussing it out loud and making your points
1814160	1819440	and then you'll give your final answers. Okay. What's your thing? But if I share my reasoning,
1819440	1823200	then they get to piggyback on my intuition. You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay.
1823200	1827760	So we'll go down the line. Spencer. I want a final answer from this guy before I swoop in
1827760	1833440	and snatch it up. You're totally right. I want to hear what Dan has to say. Okay. But Spencer,
1833440	1838720	in this round, you go first. So you decide. Okay. That makes sense. Um, I'd like to pick a,
1838720	1845840	because I mean, that sounds right. The Sesame street. It's my honor. They value letter economy,
1845840	1851280	right? Okay. I don't understand the Sesame street reference. They value letter economy.
1852000	1856800	They do. Well, letters are very important. Well, letters are their sponsor. They can't just have
1856800	1866480	two. I still don't get the connection to Sesame street though. I understand letters are on the
1866480	1877440	show. I don't understand why I don't remember. I mean, I've seen them all and I don't remember
1877440	1882080	somebody coming out to never put a two rows next to each other. I don't think they did. I think
1882080	1889040	they just imparted the value of an L to you to the extent that, uh, that, that don't buy it. Yeah.
1889040	1891840	Anyways, I'm going to go, I'm going to go with B and I'll tell you why.
1892800	1899120	To the dad one, two L bills. That's the dad one. My dad, two Ls, whatever. I've met a lot of
1899120	1904400	fellas who use their middle name as their first name because, uh, uh, people who spell their first
1904400	1908000	name differently, et cetera, it always has to do with a fucked up relationship with their dad.
1909600	1916240	And we'll go with that. All right, Rob, I'm going to take a C, um, because that's the only one I
1916240	1926000	remembered. I enjoy correcting people. Yes. Yes. That's exactly the one. The correct answer is A,
1926000	1935280	the Sesame Street answer. That's not fair. He went first. Well, some would argue he's in the world.
1935280	1939440	Everyone would argue he's in the worst position in this round. Dan will guess first and then Rob
1939440	1948240	and then Spencer. Question number two. Question number two. A, I won a Philo T Farnsworth award
1948240	1954720	for video art. B, I won a Philo teen Farnsworth award for my work with children's hospitals.
1955520	1961360	C, I won a Philo teen Farnsworth award for urban planning. Why do you keep saying teen?
1961360	1968000	Huh? T. T. Sorry. Philo teen Farnsworth. It's like a new Nickelodeon cartoon.
1968880	1973360	Uh, I will go with A because Philo T Farnsworth invented television.
1973360	1977200	Okay. I think we're learning about how much I know about Philo T Farnsworth.
1979040	1986400	Sorry. Okay. Uh, go ahead, Rob. Uh, I don't know who this Philo guy is, but, uh, Bill,
1987200	1994480	it seems like a kind of a video person. I'm also going to go with A, but I thought of that before
1994480	1999840	Harmon said anything. And I would have got that first one if I had some music to think.
2002800	2010800	Kind of, are you running here? I'm sorry. I'm going to go with, uh, I'm going to go with, uh,
2010800	2017120	A because I had a good reason for it. All right. That is correct.
2018960	2021680	We all win. We're all tied up.
2021680	2025920	Philo T Farnsworth was reportedly, I don't know if it's urban legend, supposedly was
2025920	2031680	thought of the idea for television while mowing his lawn, noticed that the, the rows and columns
2031680	2036560	of, uh, the different squares, like, uh, looked at them and kind of came up with the idea of what
2036640	2043760	we would one day call pixels. Right. And the T is where we get TV from.
2044400	2048320	That's correct. That is correct. The T was taken from his name.
2048880	2050560	Philo TV Farnsworth.
2054720	2059840	The weird thing is the T stands for toilet. His dad always wanted him to, to invent the toilet.
2059840	2065280	Fuck that. Philo, I didn't know you could name your kid after something you used to make
2065280	2069520	necklaces with. All right. Number three, you can name your kid after everything.
2072800	2077600	Or anything, but you can't name him a number. If somebody tried to name their kid a number
2077600	2082480	in like Europe somewhere and then another cyborg, someone else tried to name their kid
2082480	2089280	Adolf Hitler or something, which somebody tried to name their kid, uh, God. And they
2089280	2094320	didn't let that happen. No, no. The judge said, no, that's just for that's that name is for the
2094320	2101520	creator. It was totally that's fucked up. The Hitler thing. I mean, come on, you can't
2101520	2108960	fight city hall, but, uh, I mean the God thing, whatever. Question number three, and this, uh,
2108960	2113200	Rob, you will answer this first. I promise there will be thinking music. Good question. Number
2113200	2119280	three. When I was in grade school, I won two gold and several silver medals. Sorry. When I was in
2119280	2127840	grade school, I won two gold and several silver medals for a science B singing C shot put. What
2127840	2137120	was the second one? Singing, singing. Oh, a science B singing C shot put.
2140720	2144400	Waiting. Who's giving medals to grade schoolers?
2144640	2153360	I just love, love that he specified several silver medals. Several. They kind of, that kind of means
2153360	2161200	a gold. Yep. That kind of specificity only comes from somebody who is interested in science only.
2161200	2168240	All right. Science. However, the music helped. I'd like to, uh, point out that the score was
2168240	2174000	erroneously reported as tied earlier. No, no, I typed. I took it back right away. I said, no,
2174000	2180400	no, it's not. You have two and the other. And, uh, just settle down. The game's not over yet,
2180400	2185840	man. You're totally right. I said it. I took it back. Just settle down. Just clarifying for
2185840	2193360	the podcast. Don't worry. It is not tied. Spencer is two. Dan has one. Rob has one. Now, now Bill
2193360	2202240	seems like the type who can, uh, put a shot. All right. That's the whole shot putting. Okay.
2202880	2208240	All right. Spencer's answer is shot put. Dan. I, I'm, I'm, I, my instinct is to go away from
2208240	2213840	science because it feels obvious because he's, he's a harm in town, uh, attendee and he makes
2213840	2220480	things. And, uh, and so it would be weirder for him to be a good singer or a shot putter.
2220480	2224560	If you're in grade school, I mean, that doesn't have any bearing on what you become just because
2224560	2230560	he doesn't look like Jesse Ventura. Now doesn't mean he wasn't the, the ace shot putter of his
2230560	2235680	grade school. I mean, what did it take back then? You have to shoot a heavy ball further than a bunch
2235680	2243760	of fourth graders, you know, and you could have been good at anything. The question is what you
2243760	2255280	think of the word shot put as a comedic third. And I feel like the answer is yes. There wasn't a,
2255280	2259680	there wasn't a comedy one in there and there wasn't, there wasn't one with a zing. That's the,
2259680	2265840	that's the zingy one. I think that was written by a singer. So I'm going to go with singing.
2265840	2267200	That is correct. Yeah.
2272080	2274560	Well done. The score is now. This game sucks.
2276400	2280400	The score is Spencer two, Dan two, Rob one. Fuck off.
2282240	2288000	All right. Uh, Spencer will start, uh, the, the answering in this round. I hate games.
2288000	2292560	I can't believe you brought me up for the game, man. After this, we're gonna play D&D. So get
2292560	2299120	ready. That's a different kind. You can't lose at that. Oh, you can. We've been doing it for months.
2302880	2310960	Question number four. I always lose. All right, go ahead. Bill was in marching band. Really?
2310960	2319440	He played one of these three instruments hurt strings.
2319440	2336080	A drum, B oboe, C alto sacks. A drum, B oboe, C alto sacks.
2340720	2344000	Who's first? Spencer is first. I just, yeah, oboe.
2344000	2350160	What's your reasoning? Because this is a bad question. I'm really arbitrary.
2350160	2355600	I just really wanted to say oboe. All right. Oboe. It's fun.
2355600	2360080	I don't think it's arbitrary at all. I think that Bill is clearly a sax man because he
2360720	2366240	looked at the marching band as an opportunity to, yeah, it's, it's a sexy instrument. It's a Bill
2366240	2372560	Clinton instrument. He wanted to, he saw himself sitting in the, in the window. He's like, man,
2372560	2379840	I have all this aptitude for science and music, but I'm never going to be, uh, like, uh, Motley
2379840	2389840	Crew. Cause I just, I also value the rule of law. All right. So, so what instrument, what instrument
2389840	2394800	gets pussy without breaking the law? The answer is sex. I know, I know, I know. I know what you're
2394800	2400320	going to say. I know. Let them, let them all answer and I'll throw out a fact and then they can
2400400	2405760	revise their answer. Oh shit. Please. I love you. This is why I didn't want you out of shape.
2409680	2412800	We'll bring you up for a follow-up. So, so if you would like a notepad or something,
2412800	2416640	so you can remember these. Okay. That sounded me or no, it doesn't. I'm in my head.
2420960	2427200	Sorry. Okay. Uh, so, so, uh, you were going with, uh, sacks, sexy sacks, which is like
2427200	2432320	making out with somebody. Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you're silhouetted in a window on an 80s
2432320	2452400	set. Yes. Dan, would you, would you do that as, as Rob's thinking music?
2452400	2461600	He just did, he just did. Okay. He just did. Bill with 1L, uh, you seem to me as somebody who
2461600	2475600	when you were younger had longer hair. Drummer. That is correct.
2476640	2480080	You know what? I didn't, it didn't occur to me. Drums are pretty sexy too. I was just picturing
2480080	2485120	the marching band drum, the one that's just tethered to your torso and you like an energizer
2485120	2491920	bunny. Uh, all right. But it's marching band. You played a drum. Never, nevermind. No, you were,
2492960	2499920	you were pretty good, right? Yeah. Come on. All right. He was specifically fifth bass drum.
2500800	2505280	So I don't know. Does that mean fifth chair or is that a specific? Oh, the biggest bass drum.
2505280	2514000	The biggest one, Aaron. All right. Question. Question number five. I was last chair trumpet
2518400	2520000	in a three way with Vince Vaughn.
2522400	2527600	It's not even a musical term. It's just before I came here. All right. This,
2527760	2536240	this question includes four quotes. This is a four option answer. And we're going to start
2536240	2544160	with Dan in the answering. A I've had migraines since I was 16. B I've had parakeets since I was
2544160	2551360	16. C I've had arthritis since I was 16. D I've had lizards since I was 16.
2557600	2562960	Oh, you're so proud of yourself for creating perfectly equidistant possibilities.
2566800	2571360	Only one of those is true. Yeah. Lizards, parakeets, arthritis, or migraines. Yep.
2572080	2577680	God, did you say this was a lightning round? No, no, no, no. Okay. We have four
2577680	2581840	choices as opposed to the molasses round.
2581840	2589200	Oh, God damn it. Okay. Parakeets, too, too, too contained. He would look at them.
2591120	2597360	The throbbing heart of a freeman beats in Bill's chest. That's why he works with wood and beef.
2601440	2603840	Lizards, there's the science angle. Oh, it's,
2603840	2607920	lizards are supposed to be gross, but I'm a scientist. I value them because I'm scientific.
2608480	2616160	Migrants and arthritis. Arthritis, he wouldn't do all that handiwork. Migrants.
2617280	2623760	All right. Rob? Lizards. For the same reasons that Dan said.
2626080	2630880	Spencer? I don't want to live in a world where Bill had parakeets.
2638640	2644240	He goes home at night, tells him about how, how did, how did Harbontown go tonight? Professor
2644800	2652720	Feathers? Professor Feathers! Because he's an expert. Yeah. What happened to you in that line, man?
2654720	2659760	What? Oh, man, after that line, I went to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles,
2660480	2666080	and I was texting on my cell phone. And the way I was texting, I don't know, but like,
2666080	2670880	it was like, it lined up some pathways in my brain. And I felt like I was a living God for
2670880	2677200	that moment. Like, like high on all the drugs that your brain makes itself. Like, I was just like,
2678320	2683920	like, I could just like pass through the walls. So are you saying lizards? Shoot laser beams.
2686240	2692320	Just because of sleep deformation? A combination of that and success. And I'm sure, you know,
2692320	2698240	probably, who knows? I'm just, what I'm trying to say is that if Bill actually did have parakeets,
2698240	2706240	then our relationship will fundamentally change from here on out. I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick migraines
2706240	2711280	because I feel like I got migraines around that age. And that seems like something that crops up
2711280	2718480	at 16. Around Bill's age? Oh, at 16, he said. Well, Spencer is correct. And Dan. It is. And Dan,
2718560	2723760	sorry, Spencer. I didn't know correct. It was migraines migraines. The score is Spencer three,
2723760	2728320	Dan three. We know, we know, we know, we know what the score is.
2731840	2732800	What's Rob's score?
2736000	2741040	Rob Rob is in last place with two. Shut up. I was just trying to play. Yeah. Number six.
2742400	2747280	Three, three quotes. I have been bungee jumping. I've been skydiving. I've been out. I have not
2747280	2754960	been on an airplane. A, I have been bungee jumping. B, I have been skydiving. C, I have not
2754960	2760000	been on an airplane. We were going to start with this Rob. We were going to start with Rob.
2762720	2763200	Music.
2763200	2775040	Okay. I don't know how to do this. Okay. The music's fucking with me. Okay, get rid of it.
2779040	2781920	Bungee jumping, skydiving. Never been on a plane.
2781920	2788000	Skydiving. All right, Spencer. I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick skydiving. Okay, Dan.
2788000	2793600	Am I the only one? If C is correct, then B can't be. If he was never on a plane, he could,
2796880	2800480	unless you pulled a bungee cord really tight and flew him into the air,
2801360	2804320	I don't think he could ever skydive without having been on a plane.
2804320	2807680	Yeah, if B was right, then C couldn't be. I mean.
2807680	2810960	And since B and C have a relationship with each other, then I'm going to go with A,
2810960	2815360	he's been bungee jumping. Okay. The correct answer is B, skydiving.
2818000	2826480	Spencer and Lee, Dan and Rob are tied. Question number, question number seven.
2827520	2830800	This is the ice cream question. We get ice cream.
2832560	2838480	All the ice cream you want. I once won a year supply of ice cream and I always chose bubblegum
2838480	2850640	because A, it's a dessert and an activity. B, I actually thought it was cotton candy flavored.
2851680	2859360	C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it. A, it's a dessert and an activity. B, I actually thought
2859360	2863040	it was cotton candy flavored. C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it.
2863920	2865920	D, I make poor life decisions.
2874400	2875440	Who's going first?
2875440	2879600	Who's going this round? Who starts this round? Spencer. Spencer, it's you.
2879600	2881680	I'm going to go with B for whatever reason.
2882720	2885040	You thought it, he actually thought it was cotton candy flavored.
2885040	2885440	Sure.
2885440	2886400	Okay, Dan.
2886400	2889760	I'll go with C because of my continuing fixation on fathers.
2889760	2891520	All right.
2891520	2893680	I'm going to go with A because it is true.
2897200	2904240	It's a dessert and an activity. The correct answer is C, I knew my dad wouldn't eat it.
2904240	2909840	That brings Rob back to last place. Spencer and Dan tied for first.
2911680	2916400	All right, here we go. A, I have a, sorry?
2916400	2918480	No, I was cursing this game.
2919920	2924880	A, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge. B, I have two sewing kits.
2926080	2933760	C, I have 455 Pez dispensers. A, I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge.
2933760	2941120	B, I have two sewing kits. C, I have 455 Pez dispensers. We're going to start with Dan.
2941120	2947840	Fuck. Okay. I keep going to, you asked him to email a bunch of facts about himself.
2947840	2951440	So he might have, during a falter, might have gone, I don't know,
2951440	2955760	I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge. What else? Like maybe.
2956960	2961760	Because that 455 Pez dispensers thing, that seems like a make them up.
2962960	2964480	And the, what's the other one?
2965680	2966480	Two sewing kits.
2966480	2969520	Two sewing kits. That's pretty specific.
2971360	2973040	I'm going to go with sewing kits.
2973760	2974880	Okay. Rob?
2974880	2978240	I'm also going to go with sewing kits, but I thought of it before Dan said anything.
2979280	2982480	Because he works with his hands and stuff.
2982480	2984400	Yeah. You did a really good job.
2986880	2987680	Spencer?
2987680	2989600	Thank you. That's all I wanted tonight.
2991360	2994720	I'm going to go with sewing kits because that's the lowest stakes for me.
2996480	3000320	So it doesn't matter what the answer is. This is not important to you.
3000320	3000720	It is.
3000720	3003440	It's just so important to me. You don't care.
3003440	3004800	I'm playing it like a game.
3004800	3005760	And you're winning.
3005760	3006320	Yeah. That's why.
3006320	3010640	The correct answer is I have a bunch of magnets on my fridge is the correct answer.
3010640	3012000	All right. Moving on. We're almost done.
3012000	3012480	Stupid.
3015280	3016240	Second to last question.
3016240	3017440	I love this game, Erin.
3019520	3020400	Thanks, Spencer.
3020400	3021920	Yeah. Balanced viewpoints.
3021920	3024640	Are you starting to rethink your position on Dungeons and Dragons?
3024640	3025840	Do you think this is a better game?
3028000	3032480	I'm definitely considering how to work audience member trivia into my encounters.
3034000	3037440	I'm wondering if there could be a whole convention for this.
3039280	3039840	I'm sure.
3040720	3042320	All right. Question number nine.
3042320	3044080	I was in the talent show in the fifth grade.
3044640	3045360	And I sang.
3046240	3048720	A. Don't rain on my parade.
3050080	3050240	B.
3051120	3051920	Dad, don't hit me.
3054560	3055840	An original piece by.
3058240	3060000	B. Fiddler on the roof.
3060960	3062880	C. Luck be a lady.
3063200	3063920	That's a good one.
3064640	3066240	A. Don't rain on my parade.
3066240	3067680	B. Fiddler on the roof.
3067680	3069680	C. Luck be a lady.
3069680	3071520	What's don't rain on my parade?
3071520	3072160	I don't know what that is.
3073360	3074960	Don't tell me not to fight.
3075680	3076880	It's from Funny Girl.
3076880	3077600	It's from what?
3077600	3078640	It's from Funny Girl.
3078640	3079120	Okay.
3079120	3080560	It's a Barbara Streisand song.
3080560	3082000	Okay. So you put that one in there.
3082000	3082000	
3088400	3091760	But all of these songs are very popular songs.
3092880	3098160	I'm going to live out.
3099600	3100400	I'm not going to do it.
3100400	3101680	But I would like to hear.
3101680	3104240	I would like to hear two bars of Fiddler on the roof.
3104240	3106720	Like a Fiddler on the roof.
3106720	3107920	I mean, it's not actually a song.
3111920	3116320	May the God bless and protect us.
3116320	3117360	So that's another made up one.
3121360	3121840	Who's going?
3122720	3124640	Oh, sorry. Rob is starting, correct?
3125440	3126160	Yes. Thank you.
3126160	3126720	Sorry.
3126720	3127280	Your game.
3130000	3132240	Let me say Fiddler on the roof is a classic.
3132240	3135200	But luck be a lady is a crowd pleaser.
3135200	3137040	So I'm going to say luck be a lady.
3137040	3137280	Okay.
3137280	3138480	That's a drummer's song.
3142560	3144000	They just did that at the Emmys tonight.
3145040	3146000	Luck be a lady?
3146000	3147040	They sure did.
3147040	3147440	Whoa.
3149520	3150560	How did you know that?
3150640	3152800	I was on while I was sleeping.
3154800	3158000	I woke up to Don Cheadle doing this weird monologue.
3158000	3161200	I had a half a fever dream where Don Cheadle's voice was in my ear
3161200	3163840	talking about how television's an amazing thing
3163840	3165840	because Kennedy got his brains blown out.
3165840	3167840	And the TV was there for that.
3167840	3171840	And then a couple weeks later, the Beatles made it okay to laugh again.
3173600	3174480	Here's Carrie Underwood.
3174480	3176080	And I was like, what the fuck is happening?
3176960	3178320	What are you talking about?
3178320	3181520	It's just a piece of technology that has enslaved all of us.
3181520	3183120	It's not a cultural icon.
3183680	3184800	Ah, television.
3186160	3189440	Kennedy died when Beatles like, yeah, and everything else.
3189440	3190960	What are you talking about?
3190960	3192320	I was like, ah, oxygen.
3192320	3194160	Kennedy breathed it for his last breath.
3195760	3198320	Then the Beatles exhaled it during Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
3200320	3202960	Here's Carrie Underwood spewing out some more.
3203760	3205040	Enjoy your TV.
3205040	3205840	It's not dying.
3208880	3209680	I'm afraid.
3210880	3211520	Grand theft.
3211520	3212320	Who?
3212320	3213120	Enjoy the Emmys.
3217440	3218800	It was just weird to wake up to that.
3218800	3219760	That's all.
3219760	3221120	Don Cheadle's voice in my ear.
3221120	3224320	And you know how you make it part of your dream, you know, when you hear stuff.
3224320	3224880	Absolutely.
3224880	3225600	So, no.
3227520	3228080	You don't know?
3228080	3228400	Oh.
3229360	3231440	Rob's guest is luck be a lady, Spencer.
3231440	3233040	Yeah, I'm going to go with luck be a lady.
3233040	3233600	Okay, yeah.
3233600	3236240	Luck be a lady because there's the thing fiddling around the roof.
3236240	3237440	I don't even know that that's a song.
3238400	3239360	That's the correct answer.
3239360	3241120	It is a fiddler on the roof.
3241760	3243360	Maybe it means the entire musical.
3245280	3245840	All right.
3245840	3247200	Final question.
3247200	3248000	Final question.
3248800	3249760	The score.
3249760	3250960	Did we all lose a point?
3252080	3252720	No, it just stays the same.
3252720	3253760	No, that doesn't help me.
3253760	3254640	No, that doesn't.
3254640	3255440	Shit.
3255440	3256960	It'd be exactly where we are.
3257920	3261680	This round will determine whether you're worse than us or just equal.
3265120	3266000	That's it.
3266000	3267360	You have no chance of being superior.
3267360	3269040	Every game I've ever played.
3269760	3270560	Go ahead.
3270560	3271040	Do it.
3271040	3273120	That's why you invited me up here, Aaron.
3276400	3277120	All right.
3277120	3281360	This next round is unique to the other rounds.
3281360	3284960	As we stand, Spencer has four, Dan has four, Rob has three.
3287520	3288480	You're unclear at home.
3288480	3290960	Four is more than three.
3291040	3297680	In this last round, there are many different options for the correct answer.
3297680	3299200	We'll go around first.
3300400	3305520	If you choose the correct answer in the first round, you'll get two points,
3306720	3312800	meaning that anyone who guesses this correctly wins around and then we'll just do that.
3312800	3313040	Okay.
3315120	3315920	Final round.
3317360	3318080	You'll see.
3318080	3318720	Final round.
3319680	3321520	Basically, it's so close.
3321520	3323280	Whoever guesses this first wins.
3323280	3324480	And this is going to start with Spencer.
3324480	3325440	Wait, do we have to chime in?
3326320	3326800	No, no, no.
3326800	3331840	We'll still do the round robin thing and then I'll say the correct answer after the three.
3332640	3333120	Here we go.
3333120	3334240	The straight line.
3335440	3335920	Yeah.
3335920	3336320	Sorry.
3336320	3337760	It's not a round robin at all.
3337760	3339440	That refers to a very specific thing.
3341920	3342420	Okay.
3343920	3348080	Until I took up woodwork, I made music in my spare time.
3349680	3353840	I have an album I released on Amazon.
3353840	3354720	Wait, are these?
3354720	3355600	This is a quote.

3583680	3584880	So we don't do it again.
3588160	3589120	Yeah, because I don't know.
3589120	3590160	Yeah, I was too busy.
3590160	3592160	I was Instagramming a picture of you

3623600	3624480	Live it down.
3624480	3624800	Okay.
3624800	3625760	Notes catch the day.
3625760	3626880	Rain take a bow.
3626880	3628480	Two pretentious for Belle.
3628480	3630720	Like two grandiose.
3630720	3631600	Personal records.
3632560	3633040	All right.
3633040	3633360	Rob?
3634080	3635360	Empty swing set.
3638400	3640240	Why are you giving me that look?
3640240	3641040	My smile?

3642960	3643840	Because I like you.
3645680	3646080	Thank you.
3648400	3648880	Spencer?
3650080	3651920	I thought it was personal records too,
3651920	3653360	but I feel like I'm just copying.
3654240	3655200	Do what you're saying.
3655200	3656560	I'm going to do it.
3656560	3657120	So we tie.
3657120	3657520	Whatever.
3658640	3662720	The correct answer is personal records.
3668960	3670800	Well, if you want to win,
3670800	3671920	that's how you do it.
3674880	3675920	Let's give a really,
3675920	3677920	really heartfelt round of applause to Bill.
3677920	3678560	Thank you, Bill.
3682560	3684480	And I promise to Bill could come up and say,
3685040	3686480	come up and if you could.
3686480	3687200	Let's hear your thoughts.
3687200	3688000	Let's hear your thoughts.
3691440	3691920	I'm sorry.
3691920	3693360	I don't really have that many thoughts.
3693360	3693920	Oh, you don't?
3693920	3694400	Okay.
3694400	3696400	I was giving you the floor.
3696400	3697600	Well, no, I just want to say,
3697600	3699520	Rob, you totally nailed the long hair thing, man.
3699520	3700080	See?
3700080	3701040	Totally nailed it.
3701040	3701520	See?
3701520	3703840	And the thing we want to use is,
3705200	3706160	being in the drum line,
3706160	3709120	I liked Rush and didn't get laid.
3710880	3711200	All right.
3711200	3711520	All right.
3711520	3712480	Great beef steak.
3712480	3713440	Beef steak, Bill.
3713440	3715760	Now he's beef steak, Bill, everybody.
3715760	3717360	He's earned a higher bill.
3718160	3719840	Now he's just beef Bill.
3720640	3720960	Yeah.
3720960	3723040	He said in his email that he resented
3723760	3726080	the Beef Fungus Bill nickname.
3726800	3728080	I think we all knew that.
3728080	3728240	Yeah.
3728240	3731040	He's never been coy about not liking being
3731040	3732160	called Beef Fungus Bill.
3732720	3734400	Nor do we care.
3735440	3738080	I got to say, getting a nickname.
3738720	3741440	I'm sure the hamburglar wants to be called Senator.
3743120	3745600	But you know what, motherfucker stole a burger.
3750320	3751520	Ain't no fragger.
3752480	3755120	These are Dan's Five Minutes for a Night at the Apollo.
3756560	3758640	It's Senator Rob Stromthurmond.
3758640	3758960	All right.
3760800	3762240	I was going to say Stromthurmond.
3762240	3763600	That was the senator in my head.
3766880	3768640	Who's probably still alive, Stromthurmond.
3769440	3770320	No, he's finally got it.
3773920	3777040	If you would like to have 45 minutes of Harmontown
3777040	3777840	dedicated to you,
3778400	3780800	simply send a self-addressed stamped envelope
3780960	3786160	to the show every day, every week for like a year.
3788000	3788560	I'm just saying.
3788560	3790000	It was a good segment.
3790720	3792960	Some people might be wondering, who's Bill?
3794560	3795760	He comes all the time.
3795760	3799440	I've been wondering something for a very long time.
3799440	3801520	And now that I'm in the comptroller seat,
3801520	3803040	I feel like I can explore it.
3803040	3805280	You see the first and second row all the time.
3805280	3807600	I'm so curious who's in the back.
3807600	3810400	Could we talk to somebody in the back for a moment?
3810480	3814640	Those are the people that they're just standard customers.
3814640	3816080	Often the answer is nobody
3816080	3818000	because they come to the first half of the show
3818000	3818960	and they go, fuck this.
3820720	3821120	All right.
3821120	3821680	Sorry, guys.
3824160	3827520	Well, is there anybody that's usually in the back?
3828480	3828960	Oh, does it?
3828960	3829920	Oh, yes.
3831280	3832080	Come on down.
3833760	3835040	Someone sadly is up here.
3835040	3836000	Oh, there's BJ.
3836000	3836480	Okay.
3836480	3838240	I thought I saw some cat ears.
3838880	3840160	All right, here comes back, lady.
3840640	3841280	Back, lady.
3842000	3842560	You're coming up.
3843440	3846240	Back be a lady tonight.
3847920	3849280	I'm also one of the interns,
3849280	3850960	but I was a regular for Harmontown
3850960	3852160	before I became an intern.
3852160	3853520	So I lurk in the back.
3853520	3853760	Yes.
3853760	3854480	And we've met before,
3854480	3855600	but what was your name again?
3855600	3856080	Kelly.
3856080	3856560	Kelly.
3856560	3857280	Kelly, everybody.
3860160	3861440	So what's it like back there?
3862560	3863200	It's dark.
3863840	3866560	And it's hard because when people stand,
3866560	3868640	because we have to sit at the concession stand.
3868640	3871520	So sometimes when people stand in that general area,
3871520	3872480	all of a sudden, it's like,
3872480	3873920	okay, can't see the stage.
3873920	3876480	So you get the actual podcast feeling,
3877280	3878800	because all you can do is listen to it.
3878800	3881200	But then when something crazy visually happens
3881200	3881600	and it's like,
3882320	3884640	okay, now I know how the listeners feel.
3884640	3886480	I can't see anything.
3886480	3888080	You have to go to the hashtag on Instagram.
3888800	3890800	Yeah, that's what I do.
3890800	3892480	When did you just move to LA?
3893280	3896320	Actually, October 9th will be my one-year anniversary.
3897280	3897920	Sounds delicious.
3897920	3898400	Sort of.
3899120	3900400	Are your dreams coming true?
3900400	3904480	You're an intern at Nerdist at Meltdown.
3904480	3905440	That's pretty much it.
3906960	3908640	But I mean, I don't know.
3908640	3910720	I didn't think that a year living here,
3910720	3911680	I'd be unemployed.
3912880	3914240	But hooray!
3914240	3915360	I'm an LA.
3915360	3916800	You thought you'd be...
3916800	3918400	I thought I'd just be employed somewhere.
3918400	3919520	I was like, what is your dream?
3920960	3922320	I want to write for TV.
3922400	3923440	Mm-hmm.
3923440	3925360	That's a good question.
3925360	3925600	Yeah.
3926640	3929440	So, preferably TV comedies.
3929440	3929600	So.
3930320	3930640	Cool.
3930640	3932000	The M.A.'s were tonight.
3932000	3932480	I know.
3932480	3934320	We were actually just talking about them.
3935520	3937600	Because we were looking on the CNN.
3937600	3938800	Because it popped up that
3940720	3942320	Breaking Bad won for best drama,
3942880	3944400	if nobody was paying attention.
3944400	3944880	Hooray!
3946160	3947120	And then, but like...
3947120	3947840	You're here, it's good.
3949600	3950400	I'm gonna check that out.
3950400	3951040	I watch it.
3951840	3953200	It's phenomenal.
3954000	3955920	And then Modern Family won for best comedy.
3955920	3957120	Oh, very good.
3958880	3959600	Like usual.
3960400	3962400	But apparently there's a lot of upsets this year
3962400	3964080	like who won like best actors and stuff.
3964080	3964640	That's what I heard.
3965440	3966240	Nobody swept.
3966800	3967680	Nobody swept.
3967680	3969600	Like Breaking Bad won for best drama,
3969600	3971200	but Anna Gunn was the only one
3971200	3974240	who won any actor awards for Breaking Bad.
3974240	3975200	And then Modern Family,
3975200	3976320	they won for best comedy,
3976320	3979440	but none of their actors won for best comedies.
3979440	3980960	So it's a really strange...
3981920	3982800	We were at the drawing room
3982800	3984160	and we were talking about the Ebbies
3984160	3984640	and I was like,
3984640	3986160	you know, they they bothered to do
3986160	3987760	this arbitrary separation.
3988560	3990160	That's that sound of the show's air
3990160	3991440	getting let out in the background.
3992480	3995440	They bothered to do this arbitrary separation
3995440	3996800	between comedy and drama.
3996800	3998560	And so everything's bisected,
3998560	4000080	especially nowadays where it's like,
4000080	4002320	okay, and Erin pointed out that
4002320	4003920	she was watching Nurse Jackie
4003920	4006400	and I was sleeping in bed and I woke up.
4006400	4008000	Apparently I'm an asshole in my sleep.
4008080	4011280	I just woke up half asleep and went hilarious.
4011280	4012880	It's a hilarious show.
4012880	4014880	They should nominate it for best comedy.
4014880	4016400	And like in my sleep,
4017120	4019360	just still better, still an asshole.
4019360	4022480	Anyway, but these divisions
4022480	4023920	between drama and comedy exist,
4023920	4024880	but what doesn't exist
4024880	4028080	is a division between, say, the schedule.
4028080	4028800	Like the idea that,
4028800	4031760	oh, is this a show that owed 25 episodes a year
4031760	4034640	or is this a show that had to do 10 episodes
4034640	4035440	every two years?
4035440	4037280	And then I stopped myself and I was like,
4037280	4038240	wait, what am I talking about?
4038240	4038880	This is perfect.
4038880	4039920	The Emmys are actually the place
4039920	4041280	where it all comes out in the wash.
4041280	4044800	Because if you make 13 episodes a year
4044800	4048640	and you therefore get to make good television
4048640	4050320	instead of focusing on revenue,
4051440	4054400	then you have a better shot at an Emmy
4054400	4056560	and that's actually justice, I think.
4056560	4059840	So I'm telling a story about how I had a thought
4059840	4061040	and then it canceled itself out.
4063280	4065280	My friends and I have actually been talking about it
4065280	4066640	and saying that really
4066640	4070000	there should be a division between network and cable
4070000	4071840	because cable, often they have a bigger budget
4071840	4074080	and they have the ability to do way more
4074080	4074400	to staying on cable.
4074400	4075680	They used to have that division,
4075680	4078880	but that threatened both the existence of cable and networks.
4078880	4082000	Like they used to just, there was the Emmys
4082000	4083920	and then there was the cable ace awards.
4084800	4086720	You little darling cable shows.
4086720	4088800	Here's a little ace award for you.
4089360	4091280	And then at a certain point, the Emmys were like,
4091280	4092320	what are we going to do?
4092320	4093840	Just stand here while Rome is burning?
4093840	4095200	Are we going to keep having the Emmys?
4095280	4096880	Are we going to invite HBO into this
4096880	4098320	so we can give all the awards to them?
4098320	4100480	Well, it may seem to.
4102720	4106080	The interesting thing is that television is still an art form,
4106080	4107360	still a medium.
4107360	4109520	I think that's what Don Cheadle was trying to say
4110400	4111440	when I was waking up.
4111440	4113120	I think his point was that,
4113120	4115520	isn't it funny that throughout all of this,
4115520	4118400	all of the weird permutations that cinema is going through
4118400	4120240	and music and stuff that television,
4120960	4123280	it is still a thing called television
4123280	4125680	and it does carry a certain cultural weight
4125680	4128400	and movies are getting shittier and shittier.
4128400	4129680	Oh, insidious.
4131680	4134640	And TV continues to get like,
4134640	4136560	as we start to mash it into,
4136560	4138080	I guess that's sort of like print
4138080	4139600	is probably the biggest analogy
4139600	4144240	because after you mashed Time and Life magazine
4144240	4146480	into a thousand cat fancies,
4146480	4148160	that's when magazines started to get good.
4149200	4150640	Oh shit, there's a ninja magazine?
4151920	4152880	That's breaking bad.
4152960	4154560	It's like the more surface area.
4154560	4156560	Breaking Bad's a ninja magazine?
4157600	4159520	I will never make myself clear to these people.
4160480	4162160	Anyways, whatever, I can talk.
4162160	4162960	You know what?
4162960	4164240	This podcast should be called,
4164240	4166960	I Go to Bed and Mumble Things Until I Fall Asleep.
4170480	4173120	What do you plug in, Kelly?
4174320	4174800	Chips?
4175920	4176400	No.
4176400	4177280	Soda?
4177280	4179360	I mean, if you want to buy everything,
4179360	4180160	it's a dollar.
4181040	4181680	Soda.
4181680	4182880	All right, all right.
4182880	4184640	Kelly, you don't have to do that.
4184640	4185600	You don't have to do that.
4185600	4188560	And if anybody has any jobs, call me.
4189760	4190880	All right, Kelly, everybody.
4192080	4192880	She'll be here.
4192880	4193680	Thank you very much.
4197920	4199600	Yeah, yeah, I'm very happy about this.
4201280	4202560	She wants to work in TV comedy.
4203920	4204960	Maybe she'll meet somebody.
4204960	4206560	Kelly just whispered to me
4206560	4209280	that Merritt Weaver won for supporting actress.
4209280	4210960	She's amazing on Nurse Jackie.
4210960	4211760	She's really great.
4213040	4216000	This year was weird because the categories
4216000	4219440	were so loaded with amazing actors.
4219440	4221680	And some people are saying some really mean,
4221680	4223360	bullying things about the people who won.
4223360	4224080	What example?
4225760	4227440	In the Best Actor category,
4227440	4229280	everyone thought that Bryan Cranston
4229280	4230800	was going to be a shoo-in.
4231520	4235760	But then Bob Cavalli, am I saying that right?
4236160	4237440	Bobby Cannavalli.
4237440	4241520	Bobby Cannavalli from Boardwalk Empire won
4241520	4245600	against Jon Hamm and all the guys from Breaking Bad
4245600	4248480	and also with Best Supporting Actress.
4250240	4252000	Or Best Supporting Actor.
4253520	4254240	Tony Hale.
4254240	4255200	Who's great?
4255200	4255680	I don't know.
4255680	4256640	I'm sorry.
4256640	4258160	Some people are just saying shitty things about-
4258720	4260800	Well, they're saying that like the-
4260800	4263120	During the show, like the next person comes up.
4263120	4264000	What the fuck was that?
4266320	4269200	Bob Newhart comes up and just goes,
4271200	4272160	no, no, on Twitter.
4272160	4273280	No, Bryan Cranston.
4273280	4275120	Who should have got that award, man?
4276160	4277200	You should have got that.
4277200	4279360	Oh, no respect.
4279360	4279920	Oh, man.
4279920	4280640	It's this guy.
4283120	4285200	It's everybody's buddy from the neighborhood.
4285200	4285600	Yeah.
4285600	4288160	Remember the Emmys when Amerigo Fazbuchi,
4288160	4288720	what's her name?
4288720	4289280	Ugly Betty.
4290400	4292080	America Ferreira.
4292080	4295760	Amerigo, Amerigo Fazbuchi.
4296640	4299040	Rob, you do a really good Amerigo Fazbuchi impression.
4299040	4299680	No, man.
4299680	4301040	What's going on here?
4302240	4304480	But you should have got that award.
4304480	4306720	It should have been Bryan Cranston, man.
4307840	4309600	American Espuchie.
4312240	4314720	Hey, Amerigo Fazbuchi.
4314720	4316800	Yeah, may I ask you any questions?
4318560	4321040	I know it says market price for the fish of the day.
4321040	4321520	I don't know.
4322320	4322960	Oh, yeah.
4322960	4325360	That's how it usually is every Friday.
4325360	4327440	But, you know, you come in here off.
4327440	4330080	I give you 2% off and some lemon wedges.
4331840	4332320	All right.
4332960	4336320	Amerigo, Amerigo, what do you think about gas prices?
4336320	4337760	Oh, they're through the roof.
4339280	4339840	Do you drive out?
4339840	4340800	What kind of car do you drive?
4340800	4341520	Do you drive a car?
4341520	4342560	Oh, I got the Volt.
4344560	4345680	I just plug it in.
4345680	4347120	I don't even use gas.
4347120	4350880	I haven't used gas since October.
4351600	4353440	Is that when you got your electric car?
4353440	4353680	No.
4355680	4357680	I've been walking a lot, too.
4357680	4359360	So you walked around and then you got an electric car.
4359360	4361200	Yeah, I walked to the car dealership.
4362000	4363440	Amerigo, I heard-
4363440	4363920	Yes?
4365120	4366320	Yes, Aaron McGath.
4366320	4367520	I'm losing the accent.
4368560	4369040	Oh, no.
4371120	4372480	Well, then what's left with the character?
4373840	4374480	Keep going.
4374480	4375200	Keep going.
4375200	4377440	I heard that you and your girlfriend recently had a baby.
4377440	4378240	What's the baby's name?
4379120	4379600	Volt.
4381360	4381840	All right.
4381840	4384240	Obviously, there's some money-changing hands here.
4384240	4384400	Right.
4386080	4388320	No, it's America Ferreri.
4388320	4389040	What's her name?
4389040	4390560	America Ferreira.
4390560	4391120	Okay.
4391120	4392400	She won for Ugly Betty.
4392400	4393360	Remember this year?
4394720	4395680	The year I'm talking about?
4395680	4397120	Remember a couple of years ago?
4397760	4398480	Is Ugly Betty?
4399280	4399680	Sure.
4399680	4401120	I don't remember what year, but-
4401120	4405280	Or maybe it was the Golden Globes, but I remember watching TV
4405280	4407840	and they were doing that thing where there's a person
4407840	4412240	in the wings jumping on you like a harpy as you walk
4412240	4416080	off the stage and this poor girl who was on the show
4416640	4422400	called Ugly Betty, she walked off stage after winning her award
4422400	4428240	and this woman, this waif from some entertainment show pounces
4428240	4432320	on her and goes, so America Ferreira, how does it feel
4432320	4433760	to win your first blah, blah, blah?
4433760	4434960	And she's like, oh, it feels great.
4434960	4435680	I'm just so glad.
4436320	4438000	It hasn't sunk in or anything.
4438000	4440160	So what do you have to say to all those people out there
4440160	4442800	that said America Ferreira is not attractive enough
4442800	4443920	to be a leading lady?
4444560	4447680	I just stuck a mic in her face and she was like, what?
4448960	4449680	Commercial.
4454000	4456160	You know, the show's just called Ugly Betty.
4456160	4458400	You know, that doesn't mean you get to kick me in the face.
4459600	4460640	I'm a human being.
4462800	4463040	Yeah.
4463040	4463360	All right.
4463360	4465360	Anyways, television.
4465840	4466640	It's still out there.
4466640	4467920	It's still doing its thing.
4467920	4470800	From Kennedy's assassination to the Beatles
4471760	4473760	and everything in between those seven months,
4475120	4476400	Don Cheadle will be there.
4477440	4479840	What was I was so weird.
4479840	4483360	Like at the Grammys when there's always a weird moment
4483360	4486160	where a guy comes out and yells at you for downloading music
4486160	4490560	and then recedes back into the rafters, starts playing his pipe organ again.
4491440	4497200	Fun fact, Dan and I went to the last last week, we were at the creative arts
4497200	4499280	and he's and Dan was presenting.
4499280	4500880	So he was he was backstage.
4500880	4501520	How is that?
4501520	4503600	Is there what was that?
4503600	4504080	What did you do?
4504080	4505040	What was your bit?
4505040	4509360	See, our bit was me and Joe McHale went out and our bit was that.
4511200	4512800	How do they introduce you first?
4512800	4513760	It was just top of the show.
4513760	4517440	Creative arts and he's has to has to run like a bobsled because
4517440	4524400	it's 72 awards and they it's it's so weird because it's like,
4524400	4525760	OK, it's the creative arts Emmys.
4525760	4527120	So we understand.
4527120	4531200	Don't you know, we're not you're not going to show us during the prime time broadcast.
4531200	4535360	So you would think that that would mean then, OK, I want an award for hairdressing.
4535360	4541040	I should be able to chew the scenery a little bit and go like hold my very real Emmy and go like,
4541040	4544960	OK, like, you know, you know what, I've been I've been putting my fingers
4544960	4549680	through gross people's hair for 30 years and I finally got a fucking Emmy for it.
4549680	4553440	Thank you, Jesus Christ, for giving me the power to do hair at six in the morning.
4553440	4559120	Thank you for thank you to my mother who told me that doing hair wasn't wasn't whatever,
4559120	4560000	blah, blah, blah.
4560000	4564720	They give them like 14 seconds to get through the stuff because there's so many awards and they
4564720	4570640	and they tell them the time you take getting to the stage is comes off your time.
4570880	4580560	So people who are winning for like best belt making are like running sprint to the extent
4580560	4584480	that they they love their children and want to thank them more.
4584480	4588160	They have to run like the longer they've been in the business.
4588160	4593680	The more people they have to think, the more they have to fucking truck it up there.
4593680	4597840	And the faster this weird techno music starts playing.
4597920	4601200	When they play them off, I notice the Emmys tonight, the real Emmys, they're actually
4601200	4604320	they've they've created a very delicate playoff.
4605440	4610160	Claire Daines was accepting and it was like sort of like I guess live orchestra.
4610160	4611040	Probably they know what they're doing.
4611040	4612640	They start they start vamping a little bit.
4613920	4617120	That's the creative arts is like some woman going up there going,
4617120	4621440	my husband died while I was doing John Cheetles wardrobe.
4621440	4623760	And I told him I'd be home by five.
4623760	4625200	I was home by five the next morning.
4625840	4628320	And I also just.
4632320	4636480	Including it's fucked up, including people accepting an award
4636480	4640320	for a television program about kids with AIDS.
4641920	4645360	And I was in the audience and these people won this award and they're like,
4645360	4648000	you know, this this award is it's not about us.
4648000	4650160	It's about like bringing attention to this issue.
4650160	4654560	There are kids across the country who are suffering from this disease.
4654640	4657920	And I they're dying and I just appreciate.
4658720	4660400	And at a certain point, like they were.
4660400	4660960	Thank you, kids.
4660960	4661520	Thank you, AIDS.
4661520	4661920	Good night.
4664720	4665440	Yeah.
4665440	4669840	But I was going to say the coolest thing, like, I mean, that was that was a weird experience.
4669840	4673840	But I was sitting out in the audience alone, like in the like towards the front.
4673840	4679280	I got to watch one of my childhood heroes, Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap.
4680720	4681280	Yeah.
4681280	4682000	Yeah.
4682000	4683920	And God, Morgan Freeman.
4685280	4687680	Watch Dan present this award.
4687680	4690000	Like, I don't even know what Dan looked like while he was presenting the word
4690000	4693520	because I was just like, oh, they're saying anything.
4694720	4699440	They're like, oh, he's he's really what is that young man doing?
4702080	4707520	OK, Scott, Scott Bakula and and Morgan Freeman out together.
4707520	4708960	They were sitting right next to each other.
4708960	4712800	But but you too, Scott, you want to go to the shmimmies with me.
4714000	4716000	Oh, you're driving out.
4716000	4717520	They sound exactly the same.
4717520	4718320	And that's how it happened.
4718880	4719200	Yeah.
4720080	4722960	And also, sorry, I've cleared my throat.
4722960	4723840	So please continue.
4724720	4725120	Go ahead.
4725120	4725520	Go ahead.
4725520	4726000	I'm sorry.
4727200	4728080	Lost my train of thought.
4728080	4731520	But before and well, before the MAs, when Dan was backstage,
4731520	4734960	so a producer comes out and says, OK, we need to get some shots of the audience.
4736000	4738640	We need to see you guys smiling and clapping.
4738720	4742000	You know, when they when they go to the audience, when you're really happy
4742000	4744480	because Anna Gunn won or sad because you won or whatever.
4745600	4748640	We we had to do these like laughing and whatever things.
4748640	4750080	And I was really not into it.
4750080	4754160	And then I look over at Scott Bakula and Morgan Freeman super into it.
4754960	4757280	Guys look like something really funny happened.
4757280	4758080	Morgan Freeman.
4760320	4763760	Growing his head back camera right in his face.
4763760	4764800	Him and Scott Bakula.
4764800	4766640	Like they they do it.
4767360	4769280	I have to imagine that they're either doing a bit.
4769280	4772960	They're doing it ironically and having fun because they know they're going to be front and center
4772960	4780480	or and or because in the past they haven't done it and it's like blown back on them in some weird way.
4780480	4781760	What's up with Morgan Freeman?
4781760	4782880	What's his problem with age?
4782880	4784960	You get a Tommy Lee Jones.
4784960	4787360	Tommy Lee Jones famously at the Oscars grumpy face.
4787360	4788080	Tommy Lee Jones.
4788080	4789600	Like no one wants to be Tommy Lee Jones.
4790320	4791120	That's what it is.
4791120	4791760	I do.
4791760	4793120	Speaking of Tommy Lee Jones.
4793120	4793680	Holy shit.
4793680	4794880	Batman forever.
4795040	4797680	It's like watching your dad come down during a sleepover
4797680	4799360	and like try to play cards with your friends.
4801920	4802400	Dad.
4803920	4805120	No we don't want to play cards.
4805120	4806080	We're talking about boys.
4808080	4808720	Horrible.
4808720	4810960	I don't want to pimp anybody to do impressions but.
4812000	4813200	But especially not me.
4813200	4817680	But the the hardest I ever laughed in my entire life was when we were in Milwaukee
4817680	4818880	and was driving.
4818880	4822160	Snow was on the road and I was just driving with Shrob
4822160	4826560	and he was just he was just being two face and I was just asking him questions.
4829280	4830480	He's just mad about the.
4831600	4832400	Hey two face.
4835040	4837440	This is going to sound a lot like my other impression.
4838560	4839280	But it's not really.
4839280	4840640	It's more of a character.
4840640	4841520	What do you want to know?
4842560	4843360	Two face.
4843360	4845440	Thanks for the ride by the way.
4845440	4846080	For the homeless.
4846080	4848800	No Rob is holding a side of his face and tried to.
4849760	4850240	What what.
4852480	4854400	Half half of my face.
4855440	4857040	What do you what do you like in your coffee?
4857040	4858480	Do you like half and half?
4861600	4862800	You're so villainous.
4865280	4866240	I like two things.
4866240	4866720	Two face.
4866720	4871040	Everyone has to bring something to this to this this potluck picnic.
4871840	4873360	Dan's bringing casserole.
4873360	4874320	I'm bringing soda.
4874320	4875200	What are you going to bring?
4875200	4876320	Two cupcakes.
4878640	4879840	Of the same flavor.
4881440	4881840	Yes.
4884240	4886480	He was doing it for for an hour.
4886480	4890800	We were driving around and then at the end of it I said, what's your favorite movie?
4892000	4892800	Predator 2.
4897920	4899200	I could have said critters.
4899200	4908160	I saw that they show the thing.
4908160	4909840	They show the quad video.
4909840	4911440	I don't like face off.
4911440	4912640	No, no, no.
4912640	4913680	God no.
4913680	4914480	Oh, terrible.
4914480	4916160	Oh, I got really angry.
4916160	4916400	Yeah.
4917360	4918960	They only took off half the face.
4919600	4921200	It's like catch her in the rye.
4921200	4921760	All right.
4921760	4923200	We should we got to play Dungeons and Dragons.
4923200	4924800	We only have so much time here folks.
4924800	4925200	Yes.
4925200	4925920	Come on.
4925920	4926960	For God's sake.
4927600	4930640	Now you're sitting over there hoping we won't play.
4930640	4931440	I'm sorry.
4931440	4934080	Did you notice how hilarious that whole thing was?
4935520	4936720	It was hilarious.
4937600	4939680	Are you saying it was not hilarious?
4939680	4940160	What?
4940160	4942480	He just he gets so high before the show.
4942480	4943120	That's it.
4943120	4945280	That's all all the questions you have about Spencer.
4945280	4946800	That's all that's that's liable.
4949360	4950640	That's liable to be true.
4952640	4954240	I think libel can be true.
4954880	4955360	Yeah.
4955360	4955920	All right.
4955920	4959920	So, so, Rob, you were going to play Jeff's character.
4959920	4960560	Sure.
4960560	4961040	Okay.
4961040	4965600	And why don't why don't we have a beefsteak bill play Kumail, right?
4965600	4969360	As a reward for hanging out.
4969360	4969920	All right.
4969920	4970880	Here we go.
4970880	4973440	And here comes the music.
4974640	4977840	Last time on Harmon town.
4978640	4983440	Our heroes were exploring the great hall of Admiral Darkseid.
4983440	4987040	Little dark stars black keep there.
4987040	4991680	They encountered a paladin by the name of Callis the Magnificent.
4992720	4994800	I feel like I'm really fighting this music.
4995360	4996000	Oh, sorry.
4996800	4997360	It's cool.
4998240	5000000	Callis the Magnificent.
5000000	5003920	They bullied him into killing himself in a room full of evil darkness.
5005040	5005840	Bullied?
5005840	5006240	Yeah.
5006240	5006640	Yeah.
5006640	5008640	I'd say that's a pretty fair description.
5008640	5008880	No, no.
5008880	5010240	We'll discuss that in a moment.
5010400	5014320	Then they started going up a staircase.
5015680	5016240	That's all.
5016240	5016880	Oh, okay.
5016880	5017760	So let's go.
5017760	5021360	Can we, can we do a little meta talk about that character and his attitude?
5021360	5021520	Yeah.
5022560	5024480	So we bullied him.
5024480	5024960	Yeah.
5024960	5026640	I mean, I think that's fair.
5026640	5028000	He was obstinate.
5028000	5030000	He was, he was assholish.
5031040	5036240	He came into your dungeon after fighting like two rooms full of tricky demons that
5036240	5037600	tried to mess with his mind.
5037600	5039360	And he thought you were tricky demons.
5039360	5045120	So he came in, you know, full cocked and we, and we told him that we weren't tricky
5045120	5046400	and he was like, prove it.
5046400	5047840	And then you were like, blah, blah, blah.
5047840	5049760	And he was like, you guys got fucking skeletons.
5049760	5050320	That's evil.
5050320	5052000	And you're like, oh, I'm mad at you.
5052000	5054240	And he's like, oh, well, maybe you're right.
5054240	5055920	And then he felt kind of foolish.
5055920	5058640	And then, oh, so Shane killed him.
5058640	5059040	Really?
5059040	5061920	Well, then, well, that would have, that would have killed him.
5061920	5065440	But then you guys started really, really firing back at him, being all like,
5065440	5065920	Oh yeah.
5065920	5067920	Now you guys feel bad about yourself.
5068000	5069920	He's like, oh, that's fine.
5069920	5070880	I'm going to go in this room.
5070880	5071760	And then he got killed.
5073360	5073760	All right.
5073760	5076400	So I guess, I guess that's technically bullying him.
5078160	5078400	Yeah.
5078400	5079200	I mean, whatever.
5082720	5084160	I don't, I don't feel bad.
5084160	5085120	You don't have to.
5086400	5087280	I feel great.
5088480	5090400	Some guy came in the room and whatever.
5091440	5092320	I don't feel bad either.
5092320	5094000	Cause he just sort of charged off into there.
5094000	5096160	He just, we were like, what about this room?
5096160	5097120	He's just like charged up.
5097120	5097600	He was a dick.
5097600	5101840	And I, at one point I kneeled in front of him and, and, and, and offered to let him
5101840	5105520	cut my head off if he, I was, I, I was forthcoming.
5105520	5106720	You're being a dick about that.
5106720	5109600	That's passive aggressive, passive aggressive.
5109600	5110320	Can I hit off?
5112480	5113120	Do it.
5113120	5113600	Do it.
5114880	5115120	No.
5117600	5118640	I mean, all right.
5118640	5120080	You've done that to me before.
5120080	5124720	So we, so we, we, we, we went up a staircase.
5124720	5125280	Here we are.
5125280	5126160	I still are.
5126240	5127120	A scare case.
5132160	5132960	The October.
5135200	5138320	How long this October at the holiday mattress store.
5139840	5142080	I examine my staircase surroundings.
5142880	5144560	It's a long staircase.
5144560	5147200	It kind of winds around in a circle.
5147200	5147440	I guess.
5147440	5148080	What order are we?
5148080	5149120	Or a stairwell.
5149120	5151040	What order are we on the staircase?
5151040	5152400	You know, whatever.
5152400	5152640	No.
5153520	5155440	So right now, Rob, it's like when we play at home,
5155440	5156800	like we're just interacting.
5158000	5159200	I think we're in a line.
5159200	5159440	Yeah.
5159440	5161920	I know we're in a line, but we're not in a fight.
5161920	5164560	And who's like in the middle, who's in the back.
5164560	5165760	That's up to you guys.
5167040	5167680	That's a half.
5167680	5168320	I got an idea.
5168320	5169600	Let's have him be in the front.
5170240	5171120	I gotta look at it.
5171120	5172160	I'll be in the first.
5172160	5172640	I'm in the front.
5172640	5173840	And then you can be second.
5173840	5174640	All right.
5174640	5175520	That happens.
5175520	5177760	I start running up the staircase.
5177760	5180960	As you run up the stairs, you feel the temperature increasing.
5180960	5181840	It's getting hotter.
5181840	5184480	This is the Arctic area, but it's hot.
5184720	5185360	It's crazy.
5185360	5186800	Guys, this is weird.
5186800	5187680	It is weird.
5187680	5188800	It's weird for here.
5188800	5190320	Stop running up the stairs.
5190320	5191520	You're breaking a sweat.
5196160	5198640	I feel the walls and see if the walls are warm.
5198640	5201360	The walls themselves aren't particularly warm.
5201360	5203040	It's just the air somehow.
5203600	5208000	As you are going up these stairs, you see a large orange metal door.
5208000	5212320	It's like a safe door with a big kind of spinny handle thing.
5212320	5213760	I touched the door.
5213760	5214720	It's warm.
5214720	5217760	Oh, there's hot stuff on the other side.
5218880	5219920	Look under the crack.
5221040	5222640	I look under Rob's crack.
5224160	5225520	No, the crack of the door.
5226960	5228000	It's like a safe door.
5228000	5228800	There's no crack.
5228800	5229280	Yeah.
5229280	5230640	You didn't check, did you?
5230640	5231600	I look under the crack.
5231600	5232480	There is a one like you.
5232480	5232960	Okay.
5232960	5233440	All right.
5233440	5234000	Now we know.
5236000	5237280	It could be an above crack.
5237280	5238640	You didn't check that either.
5239680	5240640	Okay, people.
5240640	5241520	Stand down.
5241520	5242880	We got a hot door here.
5242960	5243920	This is a hot door.
5245440	5246560	It's a safe type door.
5246560	5248720	There seems to be hot elements on the other side.
5248720	5250640	At this point in time, I am a mage.
5250640	5253360	I will cast resist elements on most of you.
5254080	5257520	If you want resist elements cast upon you, please come to the front.
5257520	5263040	If you are a skeleton or an assistant to a skeleton, please remain behind the living.
5264560	5268240	I repeat, you will not have resist elements cast upon you if you are a skeleton.
5268240	5271120	If you are a skeleton, you already resist elements.
5271120	5271840	You are dead.
5272880	5278320	I cast resist elements on people.
5279440	5282000	I think that only works on one person.
5282000	5282720	Do it on me.
5285280	5286240	Cast elements.
5286800	5289680	I say that I'll save it for a rainy day,
5289680	5292800	and then I do an under the breath resist elements casting on myself.
5298000	5298800	That happens.
5298800	5301120	It's not noticeable.
5301120	5301840	All right.
5302560	5303200	What are you?
5303200	5305040	Are you a thief or a rogue?
5305040	5307200	I'm a quark barbarian.
5308960	5310720	I'm a half elf.
5310720	5312480	I put on my flaming armor.
5313360	5313840	Hello.
5316640	5320240	And I go up to the door, and I try to open the door.
5320240	5320720	Wait, wait, wait.
5321680	5322240	I stop.
5322240	5322880	I stop you.
5324720	5325600	How are you stopping me?
5325600	5328320	Well, it's like by putting two hands on...
5328320	5329760	On my flaming armor?
5330640	5331920	On your shoulders, yeah.
5331920	5332880	Okay, okay.
5332880	5335040	It's romantic for a second unless it burns me.
5336080	5336640	Okay.
5336640	5338640	I turn down my flames.
5339360	5340720	I resist your elements.
5340720	5341200	Okay.
5345040	5346640	Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.
5346640	5348400	Am I standing in the between them?
5350160	5351040	Only if you want to be.
5351040	5353280	I'm going to step around and do trapsense on the door.
5353280	5354080	That's up to you guys.
5354080	5355200	So you put your hands on my shoulder.
5355200	5356960	I want Christopher to check out the door.
5356960	5357680	He's a rogue.
5357680	5358480	That's what I'm saying.
5359120	5360080	When you come to a door...
5360080	5360800	Just let me...
5361680	5362480	Yeah, sure.
5362480	5363280	A certain protocol here.
5363280	5364240	Are you trying to protect me?
5365120	5365360	Yes.
5368000	5368560	Yes, yes.
5369440	5371200	The way I try to protect you when I say,
5371200	5372960	did you turn the gas off when we go to bed?
5374240	5375920	I'm trying to protect the whole house.
5379040	5379520	Love.
5381680	5382400	What's happening?
5383680	5384320	Trap sense.
5384320	5386160	Christopher wants to check out the door.
5386160	5386960	Trap sense?
5386960	5387920	Is that what I heard?
5387920	5388240	Yeah.
5388320	5389120	Okay.
5389120	5390960	So you examine this door.
5390960	5396480	It looks on closer inspection to be made of adamantium.
5397520	5398480	Oh, oh wait.
5398480	5400160	No, that's okay.
5400160	5400480	All right.
5401200	5405440	It's a very strong and a hard metal for those of you not in the know.
5407120	5408320	It's what...
5408320	5408720	No traps.
5408720	5409760	Wolverine's made out of.
5409760	5410640	Not that you can tell.
5410640	5411760	Yeah, the skeleton.
5411760	5418480	It's one electron different from unobtainium.
5423120	5424160	That's the door.
5425120	5425440	All right.
5425440	5429280	So it's made out of an adamantium, but there's no traps that you can sense?
5429280	5430160	I don't see anything.
5430800	5432000	So it's like a vault door.
5432000	5433280	Like it's got a crank on it?
5433280	5433760	Yeah.
5433760	5434960	Yeah, let's open this thing.
5434960	5435600	Come on.
5435600	5436240	All right, kitten.
5436240	5437440	You want to do a...
5437440	5437840	Sure.
5437840	5438480	Yes, I will.
5442320	5443440	Whatever you want.
5443440	5445920	Whoever wants to open it, open it.
5445920	5447360	Hey, you want to open this door with me?
5448000	5448400	Sure.
5448400	5450000	Okay, you grab one side.
5450000	5450800	I got this side.
5451600	5452400	Okay, and now...
5452400	5453120	I'm going to push up.
5453120	5453840	You push down.
5453840	5455840	Let's do it counterclockwise.
5455840	5458080	I mean it in a straight line.
5459280	5460640	No, no, let's open it.
5460640	5461120	Okay.
5461120	5462240	One, two, three, open.
5463120	5466800	You pull the handle and it slides open with a sharp snicked.
5466800	5467280	Ouch.
5467280	5468000	Snicked?
5468000	5468640	A snicked?
5468640	5469760	From the adamantium.
5469760	5470320	That's the sound of...
5470320	5471120	One, two, three.
5471120	5472960	That's a fucking nerd.
5472960	5474000	Nice.
5474000	5475040	It's a deep cut.
5477760	5480160	A nerd alert sounds throughout the dungeon.
5482720	5484000	Yeah, so yeah.
5484000	5485600	I don't understand what's going on.
5486480	5489040	Oh my god, my high school girlfriend came to the show.
5491040	5491840	What's happening?
5491840	5494640	A snicked is a sound effect that Wolverine's just...
5494640	5497200	I don't know who the fuck a wolf man is.
5497200	5499200	Why did you come here, Trisha?
5499520	5501600	I'm going how?
5501600	5503120	You won't go to the snowball dance with me?
5503120	5504960	You show up when I'm 40 to the Harman town?
5506960	5507680	That's weird.
5508240	5510480	Your theme for your dance was just snowball.
5511280	5513040	We had a winter dance, snowball dance.
5513040	5515440	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5515440	5521040	The room is hot like a summer's day and you begin to sweat.
5522480	5524080	Those things are hot, right?
5524080	5526240	Yeah, depending on where you are.
5526240	5527840	I guess that's a good point.
5528800	5532480	Inside this room are three massive stone lions,
5532480	5535760	mouths frozen open and a ferocious roar.
5535760	5537600	You don't see any doors in this room,
5537600	5540880	but there are masses of chains hanging from the high ceiling,
5540880	5545120	some dangling down like silver vines from the clanking canopy.
5545120	5547200	I grabbed one of the chains and I started pulling on it.
5549440	5551760	It's too high up.
5553360	5556960	Probably the lowest one is about 20 feet off the floor.
5558320	5559200	I can't jump it?
5559760	5560400	Nope.
5560400	5563040	Okay, you jump on one of these stone lions and jump up there.
5564080	5567840	In the center of the room, you also see a metal treasure chest.
5568880	5572160	I approach the treasure chest, try to open it.
5572160	5574160	You approach the treasure chest.
5574960	5576960	Do you mind if I look at that first?
5578640	5581840	Yeah, if you look at it first.
5581840	5583360	Yeah, I'd like to trap sense on it.
5583360	5584400	Let them trap sense.
5584640	5585120	Okay.
5585120	5587280	What don't you understand about this procedure?
5587280	5588000	I don't want you to get hurt.
5588000	5588880	Trying to be nice.
5588880	5590880	Yeah, no trap sense first.
5590880	5591440	A little bit of caution.
5591440	5592400	Sorry, I misunderstood.
5592400	5593120	I thought it was just like...
5594080	5596720	No, I just wanted to open it and take everything and keep it to myself.
5597600	5598320	Go ahead, Chris.
5599360	5600400	There's a trap.
5606240	5607200	Trap sense.
5611760	5612640	The proletariat.
5614800	5619440	The proletariat are in a trap of economy.
5619440	5620160	Oh, traps.
5623920	5625360	And television was there.
5629040	5631040	For the first season of Gilligan's Island,
5632880	5635360	to the explosion of our president's brains,
5638000	5639440	what did they have in common?
5639440	5640160	Television.
5640480	5646240	It doesn't make sense to praise that as if it's like, yeah.
5648320	5649120	What a medium.
5650960	5651920	Good job, TV.
5652720	5654800	Thanks for the Beatles and Killing Kennedy.
5655600	5656000	Thank you.
5656000	5657040	I'll keep watching you.
5658480	5659600	Commence with the awards.
5659600	5660240	Who got one?
5660240	5660800	Anna Gunn.
5660800	5661280	All right.
5661280	5662640	I knew I was watching something important.
5663760	5665120	So what's the nature of the trap?
5665120	5665680	Dear Dan Harmon,
5666880	5669600	I didn't write what I said at the Emmy.
5670320	5670800	Oh, shit.
5670800	5672160	I got an email from Don Cheadle.
5673120	5674320	Wrote that for me.
5676480	5681520	Dear Don Cheadle, first of all, let's follow each other and send each other...
5683040	5684640	We shouldn't have to direct tweet each other.
5690160	5692080	Anyways, so we open the door.
5692080	5693600	There's some lions and some chains.
5693600	5694240	There's a trap.
5694240	5695840	Chris, do you know what kind of trap is on the...
5697200	5698240	It's a good question.
5699120	5699440	Okay.
5700240	5703280	You think it might be some sort of mechanical-based trap.
5703920	5706240	Mechanical-based trap.
5706240	5708560	That's situated on the locking mechanism.
5708560	5710400	No other exits from this room?
5710400	5712000	Not that you can see.
5712000	5712320	Hey.
5712320	5715120	Do I think it's related to the lions or the chains?
5715120	5718160	It's not related to anything but the chest.
5719520	5723280	I say, well, get behind the chest and give her an open.
5724960	5725680	From behind it.
5726720	5727600	Like, do the hinges...
5727680	5728320	A reach around?
5728880	5731360	Yeah, a reach around, yeah.
5731360	5732560	We all stand behind it.
5733120	5734960	It's designed to trap whoever opens it.
5735840	5739440	Is it a hinged chest or is it a lid chest?
5739440	5739920	It's a...
5741200	5743360	I mean, it has a hinged lid.
5745200	5745680	Thank you.
5746880	5747600	It's a hybrid.
5749040	5751760	Hey, why don't we take the hinges off the back?
5751760	5752880	That's not a bad idea.
5752880	5753360	Thanks.
5756000	5757200	How do you plan to do that?
5757200	5759520	I'm going to just start hitting it with my foot.
5763840	5764800	What do I got here?
5764800	5766240	I have conjure, Phillips.
5766240	5767440	How are the hinges affixed?
5768160	5771280	Guys, I have a cloak of resistance.
5771280	5772400	We really want to open it.
5772400	5775600	But I have a feeling that if we open it, things will happen.
5776880	5780080	Maybe the lions will come to life or something.
5780080	5782400	If I put on the cloak of resistance, I can open it.
5782400	5783200	You guys can hide.
5784800	5785520	How do you feel?
5785760	5789840	As far as I understand, as the resident wizard,
5792400	5794400	can I cast Detect Magic on this thing?
5794400	5794880	Yeah.
5795760	5801200	Will that allow me to also further get a little more information about if there is magic,
5801200	5802320	what kind of magic?
5802320	5804560	Yeah, but I said it was a mechanical trap.
5804560	5805120	Yeah, but I...
5806560	5809040	Okay, so that's you telling me not to waste my spell.
5809040	5809440	Yeah.
5809440	5813520	Okay, so what I'm saying is it's a mechanical trap.
5813520	5818320	There's no mechanics on God's earth that will make these lions come to life.
5818320	5819920	I'm not saying they won't at some point.
5820480	5823600	But the trap that we sensed, it's going to be...
5823600	5826320	It's like, there's some shit that's going to, you know,
5826320	5829680	it's like, oh, I got shot with a dart or there's gas that comes out.
5829680	5830960	It's a mechanical trap.
5830960	5832160	I don't think so.
5832160	5832400	No?
5835760	5839280	I was kind of thinking we could use some vials of acid on the hinges.
5839280	5841120	Yeah, why don't we put some acid on the hinges?
5841120	5841840	I love it.
5841840	5842240	All right.
5842800	5844720	I'm just saying, don't stand in front of the chest.
5844720	5845280	What are you doing?
5845280	5848080	All right, I still put on my cloak of resistance.
5848800	5849360	Good call.
5851200	5853440	As you put it on, you feel more resistant.
5855520	5857760	She hasn't been wearing that the entire time?
5857760	5859520	No, I mean, she has.
5860160	5861680	You guys are all wearing clothes.
5861680	5864240	I put on my cloak of oppositional defiant disorder.
5866080	5866800	No, you don't.
5872240	5873840	Yeah.
5875520	5877920	So do you want to do the acid thing?
5879040	5879840	All right.
5879840	5885200	So you pour your vials of acid over the hinges on the back of this chest
5885200	5888320	and it bubbles and you smell a terrible smell.
5888320	5893680	But eventually it eats through and you see these hinges are now gone.
5893680	5895680	You could probably pull up the top of the lid.
5895680	5901920	To me, the smell is good because it's the smell of a trap being foiled.
5902240	5904640	Yeah, then it does smell good to you.
5906720	5907520	All right, gentlemen.
5909200	5910720	The snack is lit over.
5910720	5911760	All right, let's do it.
5911760	5912160	All right.
5912720	5913040	All right.
5913040	5917840	You open up the lid and as you open it, you see the trap mechanism inside.
5917840	5919840	It looks like it's a little tiny crossbow.
5919840	5923600	So you pull off the lid and it just fires the crossbow in the other direction.
5923600	5924400	See, dumb.
5925600	5926400	Child's play.
5926400	5927200	Yes.
5927200	5927760	All right.
5927760	5934960	Inside the chest are 60 arrows and two bags of arts and crafts supplies.
5937600	5938080	Really?
5938960	5939920	Thank you, Spencer.
5939920	5940640	I'll take those.
5940640	5943440	I'll take those.
5943440	5944800	I take all the glitter.
5948320	5949440	All the glitter's mine.
5949440	5951040	I want all the craftwood.
5951040	5952560	Is this a moorane chest?
5952560	5953600	I mean, it's just a chest.
5953600	5954000	Thank you.
5954000	5954720	It's just a chest.
5954720	5955440	That's nice.
5955440	5956000	That's nice.
5956960	5960800	Gentlemen, I'm going to go ahead and scoop up this arts and crafts supplies.
5960800	5961280	All right.
5961280	5964080	And I'm going to take 20 of these arrows.
5964080	5964320	What?
5964320	5967440	You can't take the arrows and the arts of crafts.
5968480	5969280	I just did.
5969280	5970160	She's not taking all of them.
5970160	5971280	She's just taking some of them.
5971280	5971680	What?
5971680	5972880	Let's divvy up the arrows.
5972880	5973760	You got a crossbow?
5975520	5977760	Crossbows take bolts, not arrows.
5977760	5977920	Yeah.
5979360	5979520	All right.
5979520	5980560	Well, that turned out great.
5980560	5983840	In celebration, I walk up to one of the stone lions and I kick it and I go,
5983840	5984560	yeah!
5987120	5988720	It's pretty invigorating.
5989520	5990880	It doesn't hurt too bad.
5990880	5991840	You're just feeling great.
5991840	5993280	I don't have a bow.
5993280	5994560	Stop looking, everybody.
5994560	5995040	Sorry.
5996080	6000000	Can I use wild empathy on the frozen lions to figure out what happened?
6000000	6003680	You could try, but you don't feel empathy coming towards them
6003680	6005760	as if they're just statues or something.
6005760	6007600	I get on top of one of them and I'm like,
6008240	6011680	I wish one day they'll invent something that stores images.
6014800	6016480	I burn that image into my mind.
6016480	6017200	Burn this into your memory.
6018400	6019920	I remember that time.
6019920	6021920	What's in the arts and crafts supplies?
6021920	6023760	You know, just general stuff.
6024400	6025040	All right, Spencer.
6025040	6026720	If we want to go down this road, we'll go down this road.
6026720	6029680	I figure at least give you the tools to do it with, right?
6029680	6030240	Okay.
6030240	6033680	I examine the eyes and mouths of the lions,
6033680	6037760	just looking for gems, baubles, other sundry notions.
6037760	6041680	You see, their eyes do kind of look a little glinty,
6042560	6045040	like glint things.
6045840	6048160	In celebration of getting all the supplies,
6048160	6051280	I grabbed two of the chains and I start swinging around.
6051280	6052800	She can't do that.
6052800	6053680	She can't do that.
6054640	6056560	I tried doing that and you said I couldn't.
6056560	6058160	Yeah, you're not high enough.
6058160	6058560	You'd have to jump.
6058560	6059200	Right.
6059200	6060000	Not high enough.
6060000	6061440	Guys, I got a glint over here.
6063600	6064480	I got a glint.
6065680	6066800	Is there anything in its mouth?
6068800	6069600	Who's asking?
6070480	6072960	I'm asking him because he's up there.
6072960	6074320	I got a glint in the eyes.
6074320	6075520	I don't know.
6075520	6076480	The mouth seems empty.
6077600	6078560	Mouth clear.
6078560	6079440	Eye glinty.
6079440	6080480	Can I climb on the...
6080480	6083920	Can I climb on top of the lion and then jump on a chain?
6083920	6084640	Yeah, hold up.
6084640	6086320	You didn't say I could do that.
6087920	6088880	Well, you didn't ask.
6090480	6091120	You do that.
6091120	6093200	You climb up atop the stone lion.
6094080	6097680	You also can get onto one of these chains if you'd like.
6097680	6099440	I want to get on one of the chains.
6099760	6100240	Then you do.
6101760	6103040	I want to swing around.
6103040	6104000	You swing around.
6104000	6106240	It's like a joyous occasion.
6107440	6112880	I have a knife I want to use to pry some of the glintiness out of these lion eyes.
6112880	6116640	Okay, so you're trying to pry the eye.
6118160	6120800	When you're jamming it with your pryer,
6121600	6126000	you feel the eye go in a little bit like it's being pushed inward.
6126000	6130480	And you hear a rumbling coming from the ceiling above,
6130480	6137280	and you on the chain feel yourself shaking on this chain as the ceiling begins to rumble.
6139920	6141040	I got a knife up in here.
6141040	6144320	I rushed to build lion opposite, and I'm going to climb up on that lion.
6144320	6145200	On what now?
6145200	6147600	The lion that's opposite him, so it'd be diagonal, I guess.
6147600	6148720	So you're all on lions?
6149520	6150400	Might not be a bad idea.
6150400	6151920	Well, I mean, I'm not.
6151920	6153200	I'm standing here.
6153200	6154640	Would you like to be on the lion?
6156640	6156960	Yes.
6159440	6161280	All I wanted was to be invited.
6163600	6165200	Everyone gets on a lion.
6165200	6165680	Yay!
6166880	6171280	The rumbling continues and gets louder and builds to a cliffhanger.
6175600	6176960	Thank you everyone for coming.

6195120	6196000	Thank all of you.
6198640	6199360	I don't know.
6199360	6200560	Exit through the gift shop.
6201200	6203200	I don't know what Jeff usually says.
