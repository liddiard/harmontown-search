0	26200	That was a bigger ice cube than I intended here, hang on.
26200	50640	Let's welcome the game master, the master of games, the master of one and all, the
50640	54960	star of Herman Quest, Mr. Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
54960	68720	Spencer, what's going to happen when we don't have underwear as to do together anymore?
68720	75880	I don't know, we'll have to sell something else, maybe we can become traveling salesmen.
75880	77920	Like vacuum cleaners and the type of videos and whatnot?
77920	79920	Yeah, like a death of a salesman.
79920	83840	All right, I'm Willie Lohmann, the death of two salesmen.
83840	84840	Yeah.
84840	87880	Let's bring out the mayor of Hamilton, Mr. Dan Harmon, everybody.
87880	99200	Hip hop, you know what, stop rapping, rapping, that's all you got.
99200	108800	Hippity, hippity, hippity hop, my name is Mr. Rap, I like to go into a trap because I'm
108800	109800	self-destructive.
109800	116720	I have a question for you, Mr. Rap, why do they call you Mr. Rap?
116720	124360	Because I like to go into traps and then it rhymes, I'm actually not very good at rapping,
124360	134320	I'm more passionate about trapping myself, I'm self-destructive, I love to be trapped.
134320	135320	Everybody trap me.
135320	139080	What's your favorite kind of trap to be trapped in, like a snare or a?
139080	149000	A bohemian spike pit, a deceptively peaceful name for one of the most brutal traps devised
149000	152200	by the human mind.
152200	155200	Tell me how it works.
155200	159480	Well it's a trapezoidal hole so you can't get out, if you get trapped you scream and shout,
159480	164320	you fall into the pit and the spikes go through, what you going to do, what you going to do?
164320	169200	My name is Mr. Rap, I'm here to say, I fell into one of those today and it really made
169200	173320	me happy, all the way, by the way, also gay.
173320	184320	Now, now, Mr. Rap, I think that, obviously you know a lot about traps, but I think you're
184320	188000	kind of varying the lead that you're, you're pretty a good rapper too.
188000	189000	Nah.
189000	192000	Oh, come on Mr. Rap.
192000	193000	Nah, come on.
193360	199360	I think you're using traps as a camouflage for your actual love of freestyle rapping.
199360	204880	Well I flow to the mic and I do much better, I fucked your mama so hard I made her a sweater
204880	207880	out of cum, it was woven.
207880	209880	I'm state woven, I'm rap.
209880	211880	Mr. Rap, can I put it, can I get five?
211880	212880	I'm sorry, what?
212880	213880	Excuse me for a second.
213880	214880	Yes?
214880	215880	You made a sweater out of cum?
215880	216880	Yes.
217880	220880	Cause the ropey knots were very ropey.
220880	222880	You're okay.
222880	224880	Yeah, alright.
225880	228880	Alright, so let's give it up for Mr. Rap.
230880	236880	Not, not only a rapper but a big trap enthusiast and also a cum weaver.
236880	240880	He loves to be trapped and he loves throwing his ropey knots.
240880	242880	Oh, cream weaver.
242880	248880	Yeah, I believe I can make you a sweater.
248880	252880	Imagine the discipline it would take to cum a sweater.
252880	257880	Yeah, or the patience of the person that was getting the sweater weaved upon them.
257880	258880	Yeah.
258880	261880	How long do you think it would take to cum a sweater?
261880	263880	Weeks, I don't know.
263880	268880	Alright, I only have one thing, it just says special plugs.
268880	274880	So, look, I don't understand electronics or capitalism enough to know why this is done to consumers,
274880	279880	but, like, I just, and I can't, I know that my voice won't be loud enough and nothing will happen,
279880	285880	I just, I just, I want an air of frustration that specifically has to do with the electronic appliances
285880	291880	that for some reason, in a world of appliances that seem satisfied with a 12 volt adapter
291880	295880	or, you know, a 9 volt or whatever, you got all the different sizes,
295880	298880	but you can buy them all at an electronics store if you lose them,
298880	304880	and then there's these things, these proprietary plugs, like these computer things that they have,
304880	308880	that you look at, there's like a power brick, and then there's those fucking things.
308880	310880	Specialized dongles, Dan.
310880	315880	And it's just like, you lose, I wrote an Amazon review today, everybody was like,
315880	320880	I love this thing, this is a great USB hub, it's like pretty pricey, but it runs like a dream,
320880	325880	and I was like, four stars, if you lose the plug, you're fucked.
325880	328880	Like, I'm sorry, four stars.
328880	330880	What is the plug looking like?
330880	336880	I don't know, it's a DC 20 volt 9 amp fucking starfish.
336880	337880	Oh, like a little circle one?
337880	342880	It's like, you can't, you type that on the internet and your Styx albums come up.
342880	347880	Like, it's not, there's no way to replace it, so I just have this aluminum brick.
348880	351880	All right, let's bring out our guest.
351880	356880	Wait, before we do, does anybody have a pen that they don't care much about?
356880	357880	Oh, shit.
357880	360880	He's got a pen, just check it on stage, like I threw the ice out.
360880	363880	Oh, dude, fuck.
363880	368880	He just gets buried in pens.
368880	370880	That was a good throw.
370880	372880	That one hit me in the face, so I'm keeping that one.
372880	373880	A good throw.
373880	374880	Thank you.
374880	377880	I'm pretty excited about our pal that's about to come out.
377880	380880	Kimbo Slice?
380880	384880	Let's bring out Kimbo Slice.
384880	387880	Is he the McCartney of the Kids in the Hall or the Lennon?
387880	389880	No, I would say he's the George Harrison.
389880	390880	No.
393880	395880	Let's ask him, let's welcome Dave Foley, everybody.
395880	397880	Dave Foley!
397880	402880	Dave Foley!
402880	405880	Dave Foley!
408880	411880	Oh, hello.
411880	413880	Dave Foley.
413880	416880	I believe I'm the Billy Preston.
416880	420880	Wait, is that the guy from the, is that the guy?
420880	423880	No, wait, who's the guy that got left behind?
423880	424880	Pete Best?
424880	425880	Yeah, Pete Best.
425880	427880	Well, there was Pete Best then, there was Stuart Sutcliffe,
427880	430880	whose brain exploded.
430880	431880	Yeah, no one talks about him.
431880	433880	Yeah, I know, and that was a pretty exciting story,
433880	435880	having your brain explode.
435880	437880	He was really talented too, right?
437880	439880	No, he was terrible, he was a terrible bass player.
439880	441880	Damn, I was close.
441880	443880	Yeah, he was a shit bass player.
443880	446880	You had a 50-50 chance, Spencer.
446880	448880	You had a 50-50 chance on that one.
448880	450880	I was right on the edge of that 50.
450880	452880	That's where you live, right on the edge.
452880	454880	He played with his back to the audience,
454880	457880	much like Sid Vicious would years later.
457880	459880	And Miles Davis.
459880	463880	And Miles Davis, but they had death just because he was an asshole though.
463880	465880	Okay, because he hated his crowd.
465880	470880	Yeah, I once saw Miles Davis playing in the round on a stage that rotated,
470880	473880	and he spent the entire night going...
473880	476880	Fuck!
476880	479880	So he must have been, he was in hell then, right?
479880	481880	That's the worst thing you could do.
481880	483880	There was a tunnel where the people came out of,
483880	485880	and that was the only place you could look at.
485880	492880	And he had to spot like a ballet dancer.
492880	495880	I remember when we were in Las Vegas,
495880	499880	and we took mushrooms, and they kind of didn't take,
499880	502880	but everybody ended up in one hotel room,
502880	506880	and all of a sudden the mushrooms started to kick in
506880	509880	while Rob Schrod was describing the Neil Diamond concert
509880	511880	he had gone to with a couple of the other people.
511880	515880	The rest of us had all split up and had failure of a mushroom trip,
515880	518880	but then it was just Schrod describing the Neil Diamond concert
518880	521880	because there was this malfunctioning platform
521880	523880	that Neil Diamond was like,
523880	528880	everybody put it together for the brass section or whatever,
528880	531880	and there were like these platforms that weren't working.
531880	534880	And it was like Schrod just for hours kept doing his impression of Neil Diamond
534880	536880	going like, they're coming too.
536880	538880	What the fuck?
538880	540880	It was really funny.
540880	545880	We were just all laughing like eight-year-olds for four hours.
545880	547880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
547880	549880	I think the first time I met you, Dave,
549880	553880	because now you and I have been on the road quite a bit for about a year
553880	558880	doing hilarious improv.
558880	562880	And the first time I met you was at your old house
562880	566880	with the crazy precipitous Machu Picchu staircase,
566880	568880	and then all the lights went out,
568880	571880	and there was no way to get out without breaking your ass on the way out.
571880	575880	Yes, that was our last party in that house up in the Hollywood Hills
575880	579880	where we had a party once that blocked traffic
579880	583880	all the way from Lookout Mountain all the way down to Sunset.
583880	585880	Okay, I remember.
585880	589880	We have met several times, but I bet not there,
589880	593880	but I was at one of those parties at your house in the 90s, in the late 90s.
593880	597880	And there were a lot of parties at my house that I wasn't even at.
597880	599880	And yeah, there would be huge parties.
599880	601880	Rob Cohen and I used to throw up.
601880	603880	Right, right. Okay, that makes sense now.
603880	605880	Canadian Rob Cohen.
605880	607880	But the party you were at was our last party, yeah, and the power went out.
607880	609880	There was a huge blackout.
609880	611880	All of Laurel Canyon was blacked out.
611880	614880	And we had no furniture because we were moving out of the house.
614880	616880	So there was nothing to do or see.
616880	618880	Well, there was lots of booze.
618880	620880	And the pool was heated.
620880	621880	I didn't get that far.
621880	624880	I walked in there, the lights went out, and then we all kind of just like
624880	627880	hold hands and walk down the hill together and get the fuck out of there.
627880	628880	Yeah.
628880	629880	Here's how old we are.
629880	635880	I remember being in your backyard when I tested my first cell phone
635880	637880	with Rob Schwab.
637880	641880	We were in L.A. for a while before we got our first cell phones
641880	647880	and we got them at the same time, so they were one number apart,
647880	649880	which made us the biggest dorks.
649880	651880	And I remember...
651880	653880	What's the guy's name?
653880	655880	This was before they even invented flip phones.
655880	657880	No, these were definitely...
657880	659880	Technology just flipped open and the phone didn't exist yet.
659880	660880	No, these were clamshells.
660880	663880	I remember distinctly because we were testing them at this party
663880	665880	and we were like in a backyard.
665880	669880	And Dave Rath, I remember specifically...
669880	670880	Yeah, that makes sense.
670880	672880	...who was this comedy manager who was like,
672880	676880	he was the, you know, like, this is a guy at that time
676880	679880	that you don't want to look like an idiot in front of, I guess.
679880	681880	His reputation precedes him as whatever.
681880	683880	You're like, oh, God, there's that guy.
683880	685880	I've already heard of him and he doesn't know who I am.
685880	687880	And then we're like in the backyard
687880	690880	and Schwab and I just don't even know if these phones work.
690880	692880	So we called each other.
692880	697880	And then I just remember the mortifying realization
697880	699880	that everyone was looking at us.
699880	701880	And we were clearly just like these new kids in L.A.
701880	703880	who didn't know what cell phones were
703880	706880	and we're testing them in the backyard like walkie-talkies
706880	708880	and how dorky that felt.
708880	709880	Yeah.
709880	711880	Have you ever considered, Dave,
711880	714880	what beetle you would be in the kids in the hall or who...
714880	716880	Which beetle?
716880	718880	I thought we settled that earlier.
718880	720880	No, but let's let you weigh in.
720880	721880	I don't know.
721880	723880	Have you been compared to, like,
723880	727880	you are the Lennon or the McCartney or the Harrison?
727880	728880	I don't know.
728880	730880	I don't know because we have an extra one.
730880	732880	Yeah, because it's five of you.
732880	733880	So I don't know.
733880	735880	Maybe, maybe McCartney.
735880	738880	I think you're like a McCartney, yeah, because you're cute.
738880	741880	And I'm nicer than McCullough.
741880	742880	Right.
742880	744880	Yeah, so McCullough is the Lennon for sure, yeah.
744880	745880	Yeah, yeah.
745880	749880	What's great about going on the road with Dave
749880	751880	is we travel around and now you've been sober
751880	752880	for some good long time.
752880	754880	Almost five years now, yeah.
754880	756880	And we'll be like in Atlanta, like Georgia,
756880	759880	and you're like, oh, yeah, I went to jail there.
759880	761880	I passed out over there.
761880	764880	Like, it's fun to go on the day fully.
764880	767880	I used to do bad things to her.
767880	771880	How many times have you been told, because there was a lot of drag work.
771880	773880	I don't know what the right term for it is.
773880	775880	Like, you and the kids in the hall, like, you guys,
775880	776880	there were no women in the traffic.
776880	777880	We called it lady time.
777880	778880	Lady time.
778880	779880	Yeah.
779880	785880	How many times were you told how sexy you were as a viable woman?
785880	790880	Or was that just me and my mom discussing
790880	792880	how hot you were in a wig?
792880	796880	I would say it was probably on average every time.
796880	799880	Because it was like all the other guys.
799880	800880	It was like, oh, everyone's funny.
800880	801880	Everyone's a lady.
801880	802880	That's funny.
802880	804880	But then it was like, oof.
804880	805880	Yeah, I know.
805880	808880	Kevin in particular used to develop, like,
808880	811880	fall in love with some of the women characters I would play.
811880	815880	And it was like really get unnerving because he would just stare a lot.
815880	820880	And like our crew, like, we had like old CBC crew,
820880	822880	which, you know, like government employees.
822880	824880	And at first they all hated us.
824880	825880	But then they sort of grew to like,
825880	828880	but I'd get like this old crew guys coming up to me going,
828880	830880	Dave, you're going to be the redhead tonight.
830880	833880	Oh, no, not today.
833880	836880	Oh, fuck.
836880	838880	All right, all right.
838880	840880	Is there a technique?
840880	844880	Is there something you tap into when you would play a woman?
844880	849880	A lifetime of low testosterone came in handy.
849880	852880	Do you know that you were on Jeopardy last night?
852880	853880	I heard that.
853880	854880	Yeah, I didn't see it.
854880	856880	I was watching it with Laura last night.
856880	860880	And they said there was a category of Canadian television.
860880	864880	I'm like, there's no way there's not going to be a kids in the hall.
864880	865880	Yeah.
865880	866880	Like answer on that one.
866880	870880	But I think they only said you and Kevin, maybe one brother.
870880	871880	I saw the screen capture.
871880	872880	Yeah.
872880	873880	Was it just you two?
873880	874880	Yes.
874880	877880	The Canadian comedy troupe, including Dave Foley and Kevin McLaughlin.
877880	878880	Yeah.
878880	880880	So Bruce is fucking fucked off right now.
880880	882880	Oh, yeah.
882880	883880	Yeah.
883880	887880	He's got one fewer TV's in his house.
887880	890880	That's how it really, that's what happens, huh?
890880	891880	Yeah.
891880	892880	That's terrifying.
892880	894880	I always imagine now because I have a pool for the first time.
894880	896880	So now I'm always characterizing everything.
896880	899880	I was like, well, look, this isn't gonna, I just want to keep that pool filled.
899880	902880	And I like to imagine like, if I eat it on a Rick and Morty script,
902880	905880	like a couple gallons comes out of the pool.
905880	911880	It's just like, I'll be down there in like two feet of water, like typing.
911880	916880	I remember the first time I saw your face on television when I was still in Milwaukee,
916880	921880	it was the monologue, a good attitude towards menstruation.
921880	922880	Oh, yeah.
922880	923880	That was the...
923880	925880	Please give them time to applaud them, please.
925880	930880	So that was literally the first time.
931880	933880	I had no idea what the show was.
933880	935880	Back then you flipped through channels.
935880	936880	So it was like just boom.
936880	941880	There was your adorable Apple face, your pure handsome.
941880	946880	I'd hit it if it was a woman face and hit it like sexually.
946880	947880	Yeah.
951880	952880	Yes.
953880	955880	Let's make that perfectly clear.
956880	961880	He means hitting it in a fun sexual way.
961880	966880	He means strike up a conversation and work his way up to consensual sex with it.
967880	968880	But that was a great monologue.
968880	969880	Did you write that?
969880	970880	I did, yeah.
970880	971880	And it still holds up, I think.
971880	975880	Well, I haven't like gone back and watched it, but like comedy does not age well.
975880	979880	And then like the monologue is about how you have a good attitude towards menstruation.
979880	983880	And it's like, I would believe that if you read it today, it wouldn't be like,
983880	984880	oh, that didn't age well.
985880	987880	No, I think it stands up, I think.
987880	988880	Do you remember it?
988880	989880	Do it.
992880	993880	I don't remember all.
995880	999880	Hi, my name is Dave Foley and I have a good attitude towards menstruation.
999880	1000880	That's right.
1000880	1003880	I'm the guy, the guy with a good attitude towards menstruation.
1003880	1007880	Oh, I know a lot of men are made uncomfortable by this monthly miracle, but not me.
1007880	1008880	No, I embrace it.
1008880	1010880	I embrace it the way some men embrace the weekend.
1010880	1012880	I look forward to it the way a child.
1012880	1015880	I anticipate it the way a child anticipates Christmas.
1017880	1018880	I can't remember any more.
1023880	1029880	Yeah, I remember the phrase, celebrate her fecundity.
1031880	1035880	Oh, yes, fetch herbal tea and pampering.
1035880	1038880	And I'd mop her brown, admire her fecundity.
1039880	1042880	People don't call each other fecund anymore.
1042880	1044880	No, well, so few of us are.
1046880	1048880	I'm occasionally fecund.
1048880	1050880	Yeah, how would you know?
1050880	1052880	Have you ever put it to the test?
1052880	1053880	I guess not.
1053880	1055880	No, there you go.
1055880	1059880	Me, my sperm are so motile, I could be getting someone pregnant right now.
1059880	1060880	Yeah.
1060880	1062880	You have airborne sperm.
1062880	1066880	My sperm just, my sperm sneak out in the middle of the night.
1067880	1071880	You're like the West Nile virus of date rape.
1071880	1072880	I don't know.
1073880	1075880	Why is it do you think when you...
1081880	1083880	I don't know how it got rapey.
1083880	1085880	I'm just saying that it was...
1085880	1088880	I think my sperm go out and they just, they talk a good game.
1088880	1089880	Okay.
1093880	1095880	You have charming airborne sperm.
1095880	1096880	Yeah.
1096880	1097880	They're Canadian sperm.
1097880	1099880	They're not going to sell each other out to get to the egg.
1099880	1100880	No.
1100880	1101880	They're wingman.
1101880	1102880	They're like those chipmunks.
1102880	1103880	After you.
1103880	1104880	No, after you.
1106880	1110880	And also, in Canada, your sperm has to be on the air.
1111880	1114880	What's the percentage of sperm airtime on...
1114880	1118880	Well, your sperm, all of your sperm have to be 20% Canadian.
1119880	1121880	And then you have to speak French.
1121880	1122880	And English, yes.
1122880	1123880	You have to come in French.
1124880	1125880	Yes.
1125880	1129880	So most unwanted children are Dave Foley's and Colin Mockery's.
1129880	1130880	It's everybody.
1130880	1131880	Yeah.
1133880	1136880	Somebody laughed because it was too close to home.
1136880	1138880	Are you a Toronto guy?
1138880	1139880	I am.
1139880	1140880	Yeah.
1140880	1141880	Is that everybody?
1141880	1142880	Was everybody from Toronto?
1143880	1144880	Most of us.
1144880	1146880	Also, you did more than kids in the hall.
1146880	1147880	Was everybody...
1148880	1150880	Is Lord Michaels from Toronto too?
1150880	1151880	He is, yeah.
1151880	1152880	He was from Toronto.
1152880	1153880	Yeah.
1153880	1161880	You were talking about the origin story of you guys with Lauren and the brain candy.
1163880	1164880	I love that movie.
1164880	1165880	You're alone.
1168880	1169880	Yeah.
1169880	1170880	But what was the deal?
1170880	1172880	Why did that get kind of...
1172880	1173880	Didn't it get released?
1174880	1178880	Well, it got released, but it was supposed to be released on something like a thousand screens.
1179880	1180880	But the troupe...
1180880	1182880	And at this point, I had quit the troupe.
1183880	1186880	But so they were still making the movie.
1187880	1191880	And they fought very hard for a character named Cancer Boy.
1192880	1196880	Which is funny because it's a character that I originally wrote into our TV show.
1197880	1201880	So they fought to keep Cancer Boy in and Paramount really wanted Cancer Boy out.
1201880	1204880	And then I guess they finally...
1205880	1207880	I guess Bruce got on the phone and badgered somebody at Paramount.
1207880	1209880	And they finally said, all right, you can have Cancer Boy.
1210880	1211880	And they called up Lauren and said, hey, we won.
1211880	1212880	We got Cancer Boy.
1212880	1214880	And Lauren went, oh, that's wonderful.
1216880	1221880	And so as a result of keeping Cancer Boy in, they cut it from something like a thousand screens to four hundred screens.
1222880	1224880	And they cut all of the television advertising.
1225880	1229880	And you know, that's not important to a film release.
1230880	1231880	Yeah.
1232880	1235880	Yeah, you want to reach the people that are at the rodeo.
1236880	1237880	With Cancer Boy.
1238880	1239880	Just put something on the side of a steer.
1241880	1245880	Can I talk about the origin story of Dave coming on to Who's Live Anyway?
1246880	1247880	Yeah, sure.
1247880	1251880	Ryan, we were in Chicago. Ryan got ill and couldn't do the shows.
1251880	1254880	And we were fucked because we had like a bunch of gigs to do.
1255880	1261880	And our agent at APA, Josh, called you up at midnight?
1262880	1263880	It was 11 o'clock at night.
1263880	1264880	Yeah.
1264880	1265880	Yeah. LA time.
1266880	1267880	It was one or two Chicago time.
1268880	1271880	And they're like, OK, we have Dave Foley flying in tomorrow and to save this.
1272880	1273880	And Dave Foley came in.
1274880	1275880	You hadn't done improv in 30 years.
1276880	1277880	Thirty years.
1277880	1278880	Yeah.
1279880	1285880	And I think the very first scene that we did, you and I were on the ground scissoring each other.
1286880	1289880	I was like, this guy, this guy is perfect.
1290880	1291880	Still got it.
1292880	1293880	You are up for anything.
1294880	1296880	And you do the most abstract characters.
1297880	1308880	I love you doing our version of Crap Improv because you do kind of abstruse right field characters.
1309880	1311880	Very weird. It's fucking great.
1312880	1314880	But you and I were laying on the ground and absolutely scissoring each other.
1315880	1316880	I can't remember why.
1317880	1318880	No.
1319880	1320880	Don't ask why.
1321880	1322880	Fantastic.
1325880	1329880	Why don't you guys do some improv from this?
1331880	1332880	I don't know if you're aware of this.
1333880	1334880	That's what we've been doing.
1335880	1336880	Oh, shit.
1337880	1338880	Have you been reading from a script?
1341880	1342880	Who here is from out of town?
1342880	1343880	Who's from out of town? Raise your hand.
1344880	1345880	Oh, shit. All of you?
1345880	1346880	Jesus Christ.
1346880	1347880	All right. You met him right here.
1347880	1348880	What's your name?
1348880	1349880	Nadia.
1349880	1350880	Nadia. Are you Russian or?
1351880	1352880	London.
1352880	1354880	London. Why do you have a Russian name?
1355880	1356880	I'm probably a Serbian.
1356880	1357880	You're Serbian.
1358880	1359880	Nadia.
1360880	1361880	Nadia. There. Fuck you.
1365880	1366880	All right. Nadia.
1367880	1370880	Give Dan a position that people only do in Serbia.
1371880	1373880	Like a physical position, like a pose.
1374880	1375880	That would be a very Serbian pose.
1377880	1378880	That sounds good.
1379880	1380880	You're going to get.
1380880	1381880	Dan.
1382880	1384880	Get out of your seat, Dan.
1384880	1385880	Take your mic.
1386880	1389880	Dan, you're going to be going to get water from the well.
1389880	1391880	Is anybody here from Croatia?
1394880	1395880	Any other Balkans here?
1395880	1396880	Do you have any Balkans?
1397880	1399880	Who's here from South?
1399880	1401880	We'll get to Rwanda later.
1401880	1403880	Who's here from South America?
1404880	1405880	Central America.
1406880	1407880	America.
1408880	1409880	There we go. You are here.
1409880	1410880	Give.
1410880	1411880	That's our spot.
1411880	1412880	What's your name?
1412880	1413880	Zen.
1413880	1414880	Zen?
1414880	1415880	Yeah, I know what Zen means.
1417880	1418880	Like Buddhism.
1419880	1420880	She had to explain.
1420880	1422880	She's just telling you because you might have thought her name.
1422880	1424880	She might have thought it was Zen.
1424880	1425880	Yeah, she's.
1426880	1429880	What's your real name that people can't pronounce?
1432880	1433880	No.
1438880	1439880	Stop fighting.
1439880	1440880	Everyone.
1440880	1441880	Zen.
1441880	1442880	You're not very Zen.
1442880	1443880	Zen.
1443880	1446880	Zen, give Dave Foley a Zen posture or pose.
1448880	1449880	No, no.
1449880	1450880	Just say it.
1450880	1452880	Oh, you're going to come and do it for us?
1452880	1453880	All right.
1453880	1454880	That's fine, too.
1454880	1455880	All right, Zen, show.
1455880	1456880	Oh, wow.
1456880	1458880	Welcome Zen to the stage, everybody.
1459880	1461880	Show Dave Foley what he's going to do.
1461880	1463880	All improv should be like this.
1463880	1464880	Hi, Dave Foley.
1464880	1465880	I'm Zen.
1465880	1466880	Hi, Zen.
1466880	1467880	Can I get a name?
1467880	1468880	Zen with an M?
1468880	1469880	Oh, yes.
1469880	1470880	Zen.
1470880	1472880	Okay, so we're just going to do this now.
1474880	1475880	All right.
1475880	1476880	You got that?
1477880	1478880	All right.
1478880	1479880	Let's give it up for Zen, everybody.
1479880	1480880	Zen, thank you.
1480880	1481880	Let's give it up for Zen.
1484880	1486880	Zen, go away.
1486880	1487880	All right.
1487880	1488880	So here we are.
1488880	1490880	So Dave has this pose.
1490880	1492880	Dan is getting water from the well.
1492880	1496880	And now we are going to take you to a scene that encapsulates
1496880	1498880	these physical positions.
1500880	1501880	Pretty sure this is your fault.
1501880	1502880	Yeah.
1504880	1506880	So I should have been thinking of something funny this whole time.
1506880	1508880	No, no, no.
1508880	1509880	That's script, Dan.
1509880	1511880	That's a rookie mistake, Dan.
1511880	1512880	All right.
1517880	1518880	Okay.
1519880	1524880	So if I do one cartwheel, you'll give me that human head.
1527880	1528880	Freeze, freeze.
1532880	1534880	Are you both frozen?
1534880	1535880	I don't know.
1535880	1536880	He tapped him.
1536880	1537880	I didn't tap him.
1537880	1538880	You did.
1538880	1539880	Okay.
1539880	1540880	I might have tapped him.
1540880	1542880	Maybe it was an encouraging tap.
1542880	1543880	Ladies and gentlemen.
1548880	1550880	For one night and one night only.
1550880	1552880	Canadian Elvis Presley.
1554880	1555880	Oh, shit.
1557880	1558880	Hey, everybody.
1559880	1560880	I just want to say I'm sorry.
1565880	1566880	We did improv.
1566880	1571880	You see, it's like riding a bicycle, David.
1571880	1572880	It's like riding a bicycle.
1572880	1574880	Although it doesn't get you anywhere.
1584880	1585880	But it's fun, right?
1585880	1586880	Yeah.
1586880	1587880	Oh, yeah.
1587880	1588880	Yeah, it was fun.
1588880	1589880	It was weird.
1589880	1590880	Because when they called, it was like 11 o'clock at night.
1590880	1593880	And I remember I was tired.
1593880	1597880	So my only thought was, well, I've got to drive my daughter to something tomorrow.
1597880	1600880	So if I can get someone to drive her, I'll be there.
1601880	1602880	And that was what I called.
1602880	1604880	And you were on a plane like at 6 a.m.?
1604880	1608880	Yeah, I had to be on a flight at 6 a.m. to get there in time for the show.
1608880	1609880	You saved our bacon.
1609880	1610880	Our Canadian bacon.
1610880	1614880	It was when I got on the plane and I went, oh, I don't improvise.
1615880	1623880	Yeah, well, that brought back some bad flashbacks for me.
1623880	1625880	Were you ever in an improv group?
1625880	1628880	Yeah, I did that when I was a little tight, yeah.
1628880	1630880	That's how Dan and I met.
1630880	1631880	We did comedy sports.
1631880	1633880	Oh, you were in comedy sports.
1633880	1638880	I was in LA comedy sports and he and Rob were Milwaukee comedy sports.
1638880	1640880	And we met in like 94, I think?
1640880	1641880	Yeah.
1641880	1643880	So yeah, kids know we were all theater sports up in Canada.
1643880	1644880	All right.
1644880	1645880	Same thing.
1645880	1646880	Yeah.
1646880	1647880	Yeah.
1647880	1648880	Yeah.
1648880	1649880	Keith Johnston.
1649880	1650880	Keith Johnston?
1650880	1651880	Yeah, exactly.
1651880	1652880	Yeah, that lit up all the wrong parts of my brain.
1652880	1660880	It just like I was that thing of like playing to the, you know, trying to get the laugh.
1660880	1663880	And like it just I was never good at it.
1663880	1667880	And it always made me feel sad.
1667880	1669880	What do you mean you weren't good at playing for the laugh?
1669880	1672880	I saw you be funny and go for the laugh all the time.
1672880	1675880	Well, I think it's like those freeze games and like kind of, I don't know.
1675880	1676880	There's certain places.
1676880	1677880	You're more of a long form guy, Dan.
1677880	1678880	No, yeah.
1678880	1684880	Can I get a, can I get a Dutch playwright?
1684880	1685880	Just run on stage.
1685880	1687880	We're going to do an eight hour herald.
1687880	1688880	Yes.
1688880	1690880	I heard I heard Ibsen.
1690880	1691880	I heard Ibsen.
1691880	1694880	Can we let's get a title of an Ibsen play.
1694880	1695880	The Dollhouse.
1695880	1696880	The Dollhouse.
1696880	1708880	Can I have some better lighting, please?
1708880	1709880	Perfect.
1709880	1710880	Thank you.
1710880	1723880	We now take you to act two of The Dollhouse by Hendrick Ibsen.
1723880	1739880	What have I done?
1739880	1749880	We now take you to act three of Ibsen's The Dollhouse.
1750880	1753880	Which wire?
1753880	1756880	Are you sure?
1756880	1760880	How could you not be sure?
1760880	1763880	Hold on to your butts.
1763880	1774880	Dollhouse.
1774880	1777880	You see, improv's not, it hasn't changed over time.
1777880	1778880	Improv is still improv.
1778880	1779880	Yeah.
1779880	1781880	Well, I'm pretty sure that was enemy of the people.
1781880	1787880	You ever see that movie, Executive Decision?
1787880	1788880	Nope.
1788880	1793880	It was pretty bad, but they did one fun thing, which is that Steven Seagal was in it, and
1793880	1800880	he was on all the posters, and it was like, Steven Seagal, Kurt Russell, and Oliver Platt,
1800880	1802880	our executive decision.
1802880	1807880	How can they all be, how can they all three be executive decisions?
1807880	1810880	It was the name of their improv group.
1810880	1814880	But in like the first eight minutes of the movie, Steven Seagal just without warning
1814880	1817880	just gets sucked out of the airplane.
1817880	1818880	And that's part of that.
1818880	1821880	It's like, oh, they had their whole mission planned, and he was like the alpha, and then
1821880	1823880	he just dies right away.
1823880	1824880	It was kind of a fun thing.
1824880	1827880	Was that in the script, or they just thought, fuck, we hate this guy.
1827880	1830880	I think that was the first week of shooting rewrite.
1830880	1835880	Yeah, it could have evolved out of working with Seagal.
1835880	1836880	I don't know.
1836880	1838880	He's supposed to be the worst person, right?
1838880	1841880	I heard he actually hurts people in those action scenes.
1841880	1846880	He's like, I can't act, so I'm just really going to break your arm.
1846880	1851880	He will punch and actually make contact with the stunt guy, which you're not supposed to do.
1851880	1854880	No, and it's arguably easy not to do.
1854880	1855880	And if you complain...
1855880	1860880	If you're a martial artist, you really should be even better at not hitting people.
1860880	1863880	It's arguably your job not to hit people.
1863880	1867880	And if you complain, you're allowed to not be on the movie anymore.
1867880	1871880	But also, I think there's a great story, and I forget who it was, but the stunt coordinator
1871880	1877880	completely busted his ass, like just counter-punched him and just knocked him out.
1877880	1879880	Fuck you, Seagal.
1879880	1883880	Also, at some point, he just started wearing shower curtains.
1883880	1887880	He got so fat that he just wore, like, not even mumus.
1887880	1891880	Mumus is too polite a word for what Stephen Seagal started wearing.
1891880	1894880	Mumus are too fitted.
1894880	1897880	Okay, there's been a change of plans.
1897880	1899880	We're going to go down there.
1899880	1901880	We're going to be ghosts.
1901880	1903880	Only ghosts.
1903880	1908880	There's this movie where I put a clip of it on my Instagram.
1908880	1910880	If you scroll back, you'll see it.
1910880	1918880	Clearly, it was like he got 300 pounds and he painted a Dracula widow's peak on his head,
1918880	1921880	and he kept doing even shittier and shittier movies,
1921880	1927880	and if you watch those latter-day movies, he's clearly like,
1927880	1929880	I'm not going to memorize the script.
1929880	1931880	I'll just talk.
1931880	1933880	I'm Stephen Seagal.
1933880	1936880	What am I doing in this scene telling my sidekick that we're on a mission?
1936880	1938880	Okay, we're on a mission.
1938880	1939880	It's going to be good.
1939880	1946880	We now take you to act two of Stephen Seagal as portrayed by Dan Harmon.
1946880	1949880	Whatever it's called.
1949880	1955880	Damien, we got a mission.
1955880	1960880	Okay, there's nothing to get excited about.
1960880	1964880	We're going to go fight some bad guys.
1964880	1967880	Okay, it's just a big deal.
1967880	1968880	I'm Oliver Platt.
1968880	1974880	I'm just here for Comic Relief.
1974880	1982880	Get in the boat, and we're on the bayou.
1982880	1988880	It's just a mission on the bayou.
1988880	1991880	Where are we rowing to?
1991880	1994880	Cajun.
1994880	1996880	That's where Cajuns are from.
1996880	2002880	Cajuns.
2002880	2010880	How long have you been in demolitions?
2010880	2014880	Well, it's kind of a family thing.
2014880	2020880	My grandfather was in demolitions, and my father, when I came of age.
2020880	2021880	Hold on.
2021880	2022880	Okay.
2022880	2023880	I'm going to make a three-point turn.
2023880	2024880	I saw an alligator.
2024880	2027880	All right.
2027880	2031880	I'm going to beat the shit out of him.
2031880	2036880	Hey, alligator, you like picking on tough guys?
2036880	2037880	I mean, are you a tough guy?
2037880	2040880	You like picking on non-tough guys?
2040880	2042880	What, you can't talk?
2042880	2044880	What, are you some kind of reptile?
2044880	2050880	Come here.
2050880	2053880	I lost my oars.
2053880	2054880	Yeah.
2054880	2056880	Supposed to be connected to the boat.
2056880	2060880	And the alligator is a protected species, you know.
2060880	2063880	It's not from where I'm standing.
2063880	2064880	No.
2064880	2071880	Chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper.
2071880	2074880	Well, the watch is really tossing our boat around.
2074880	2076880	Damn it.
2076880	2077880	Phew!
2077880	2078880	What?
2078880	2079880	Down there in the boat.
2079880	2082880	It's Kurt Russell.
2082880	2089880	I just want my truck back.
2089880	2091880	This is a boat.
2091880	2093880	Yeah, yeah.
2093880	2095880	Chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper, chopper.
2095880	2098880	There goes the chopper.
2098880	2100880	You see, improv is not hard.
2100880	2103880	It's not a difficult art form.
2103880	2104880	No.
2104880	2109880	It's all you, yeah.
2109880	2114880	It's like painting if all painting was Jackson Pollock.
2114880	2116880	No.
2116880	2119880	It doesn't have to make any sense.
2119880	2123880	Who gave for you, yourself excluded?
2123880	2128880	Who do you think was the most naturally funny kid from the kids in the whole world?
2128880	2129880	Naturally.
2129880	2133880	It's like born funny made you laugh the most.
2133880	2134880	Kevin McDonald.
2134880	2135880	Yeah, Kevin, yeah.
2135880	2137880	Open the door!
2137880	2139880	Open the door!
2139880	2145880	Who was the least funny?
2145880	2148880	Who didn't have a funny bone in their whole body?
2148880	2151880	That's varied over the years.
2151880	2154880	I'm kidding, of course.
2154880	2160880	I had a good time drinking with McKinney.
2160880	2163880	I had met Scott.
2163880	2168880	I was collecting my kids in the hall encounters, like a Voltron.
2168880	2171880	I've actually never met Bruce.
2171880	2174880	No, either have I.
2175880	2178880	But I finally met McKinney fairly recently.
2178880	2184880	We were both in a fun horror movie together and we hung out at Tribeca.
2184880	2187880	He was a real fun guy to hang out with.
2187880	2190880	Oh, that's good.
2190880	2193880	Did you guys ever, and you can say no comment and let's move on,
2193880	2201880	but I'm curious, did you guys ever have actual,
2201880	2205880	were there incidents that were dramatic, falling outs or anything,
2205880	2208880	or was it more kind of like...
2208880	2213880	We had a falling out that lasted 35 years.
2213880	2215880	We fought, we always fought.
2215880	2217880	But was it passive aggressive or was it...
2217880	2219880	No, it was a lot of yelling.
2219880	2223880	It was Scott, there was a lot of breaking furniture.
2223880	2228880	Yeah, it was vicious right from the very start of it.
2228880	2230880	Who was your first ally? Was it you and Kevin?
2230880	2233880	Yeah, Kevin and I were in a group with a guy named Luchkas Miri,
2233880	2235880	and the three of us never fought.
2235880	2237880	We were always very nice to each other.
2237880	2241880	And then we joined up with Mark and Bruce and other guys,
2241880	2244880	Frank Van Kieck and Gary Campbell.
2244880	2247880	Oh, and yeah, I think that's it, those guys.
2247880	2250880	And they were horrible.
2250880	2253880	They were just the worst human beings I'd ever met.
2253880	2256880	Because you were used to being with people that you trusted and liked,
2256880	2258880	and there was no fighting.
2258880	2262880	And then you found out that it could be political and crap all the time.
2262880	2265880	Yeah, because we would be supportive of them and ask each other,
2265880	2267880	and they would give notes like,
2267880	2271880	oh, my problem with that sketch is that you're a piece of shit as a human being.
2271880	2276880	And that was kind of the level of debate.
2276880	2286880	I remember our improv troupe, the Dead Ale Wives.
2286880	2291880	We would have notes sessions after the show.
2291880	2293880	I was like, oh, man, can we not?
2293880	2295880	It was just like, what are we going to do?
2295880	2299880	Tell each other I wish you were different on stage.
2299880	2304880	We weren't professional enough to take notes and get better.
2304880	2307880	We were just guys that were trained in short form
2307880	2310880	that wanted to say, fucking go longer.
2311880	2313880	And it was just the notes thing.
2313880	2316880	It was mean.
2316880	2318880	Who is the main note giver?
2318880	2320880	Because there's normally one person that wants to be the person
2320880	2323880	that wants to settle some hash after.
2323880	2324880	It totally varied.
2324880	2328880	And there would be, in the few short years where we were all together,
2328880	2333880	there were sort of rotating alliances shifting.
2333880	2336880	Like somebody's got a beef with someone else,
2336880	2339880	and they're kind of expressing that through giving them more notes
2339880	2340880	to go.
2340880	2345880	It's coming out on stage that this person thinks that that person's not funny
2345880	2350880	or this person thinks that that person is selfish and mean on stage
2350880	2351880	or whatever.
2351880	2354880	And it's getting expressed in different ways.
2354880	2356880	It's like trying to hold a family together.
2356880	2363880	Because you're together in this supposedly high stakes thing.
2363880	2366880	I'm imagining and trying to imagine your situation
2366880	2371880	because we were in Milwaukee and had no chance of being,
2371880	2375880	but the stakes were that high for us that that was our thing
2375880	2377880	and that was our family and that was our life.
2377880	2378880	And so I can't imagine.
2378880	2379880	You got to say it.
2379880	2384880	Bruce and Mark moved from Calgary to Toronto to make it,
2384880	2387880	which shows how dumb they are.
2390880	2393880	And we did, I think it was we used to fight,
2393880	2395880	even when we were just doing our club shows,
2395880	2398880	we used to fight so much that there'd be rumors going all around town.
2398880	2400880	Oh, there won't be a show this week.
2400880	2402880	No, there's no way they could get on stage together
2402880	2404880	after the things they said to each other.
2404880	2406880	Was that from very early on?
2406880	2407880	Oh, yeah.
2407880	2409880	From the get go, you guys were already at each other's throats.
2409880	2410880	Oh, yeah.
2410880	2414880	But for us, it was like we would fight like dogs all the way up until the showtime.
2414880	2417880	And then once we got on stage, we loved each other again.
2417880	2419880	And we would have a great time doing the show.
2419880	2421880	Because the show is the show and that's why you were there.
2421880	2423880	Yeah, and then after the show,
2424880	2426880	by the end of the show, we'd usually be drunk.
2426880	2430880	And we'd just hang out all night and have a great time.
2431880	2433880	So it was the lead up that was the problem.
2433880	2434880	Yeah, we're great.
2434880	2436880	Once we're performing, everyone's great.
2436880	2438880	And actually, everyone gives great notes.
2438880	2441880	Once we've decided what we're doing, everyone's really good.
2441880	2445880	But it's the deciding what we're going to do is when we fight.
2446880	2448880	Is it like people have ownership of bits and stuff?
2448880	2452880	Like, I think we should do the chicken drive-through.
2452880	2454880	And then someone's like, I hate that sketch.
2454880	2456880	But they don't want to say, I hate that sketch.
2456880	2458880	So they say, maybe we've done chicken drive-through too many times.
2458880	2461880	No, kids in the hall, we just say, I hate that sketch.
2462880	2464880	That was our version of diplomacy.
2466880	2469880	The first person claimed that we never did that sketch.
2469880	2470880	That would be his way.
2471880	2475880	And Mark had a gift that if it was four to one against Mark,
2475880	2477880	Mark would consider that a draw.
2478880	2485880	That's very Canadian to me.
2485880	2489880	Because Canadians get off too easy with the whole,
2489880	2491880	it stops at just the politeness thing.
2491880	2496880	It's like the politeness comes with extreme capacity for argumentation.
2496880	2499880	Like argumentativeness.
2499880	2503880	It seems like general statements are inherently problematic.
2503880	2508880	The politeness belies a lot of withholding.
2508880	2511880	Like you're suppressing a lot of shit.
2511880	2513880	It's just easy to say I'm sorry,
2513880	2517880	but you really hate everything that's going on.
2517880	2520880	Yeah, again, because we never suppressed anything.
2520880	2522880	That would have been sweet.
2522880	2526880	A little repression would have been nice.
2526880	2529880	Yeah, I remember when I first started doing stuff with people
2529880	2530880	that weren't the kids in the hall,
2530880	2533880	I was really startled at how fragile everyone was.
2536880	2538880	Why the fuck's everyone crying?
2541880	2542880	So fun.
2542880	2544880	Yeah, that's interesting in general.
2544880	2547880	What was your family like?
2547880	2549880	Was it functional, dysfunctional?
2549880	2551880	Oh, my family was...
2551880	2555880	Well, all of our families were horribly dysfunctional.
2556880	2559880	Most of us had alcoholic dads.
2559880	2562880	Most of us came from broken homes that wouldn't quite break,
2562880	2566880	which was parents that were just sort of perforated homes
2566880	2568880	that were just dangling.
2569880	2573880	I think all of us had alcoholic dads except for McKinney.
2573880	2576880	His dad was a diplomat, which I guess is worse.
2577880	2578880	Yeah.
2580880	2585880	And so did you have to...
2585880	2587880	At some point in your life, did you...
2587880	2589880	Have you ever done therapy?
2589880	2591880	How do you approach your self-care?
2591880	2596880	I did therapy when I was trying to find a way to end my first marriage,
2596880	2598880	and it worked.
2598880	2600880	Like couples therapy or just you going in and running?
2600880	2602880	I started out in couples therapy,
2602880	2605880	and then I sort of hung in there for a while.
2605880	2608880	I did that too, even though my couples therapist...
2608880	2613880	It was like she helped the couple that I was in get married,
2613880	2616880	and then we got divorced in like eight months,
2616880	2620880	but I kept going to her, and every once in a while, I'll bring it up.
2620880	2625880	I'm like, you know, of course, you're kind of a failure as a couple.
2626880	2628880	You had one job.
2628880	2630880	Well, I went to the couples therapy,
2630880	2634880	and part of the way through the therapy,
2634880	2637880	my wife took off back to Canada with my kids,
2637880	2641880	and then I just kept going there for a while
2641880	2644880	because she kept telling me I was nicer than her.
2644880	2646880	And then eventually she said, you know, you don't have to go anymore.
2646880	2648880	And then when I got married again,
2648880	2650880	and then my second wife and I were having problems,
2650880	2655880	I went to the same couples therapist, and we split up.
2655880	2658880	She's not very good as a couple.
2658880	2660880	But the current wife you're happy with, and everything's going...
2660880	2662880	Well, I'm back together with my second wife.
2662880	2663880	And now things are groovy again.
2663880	2665880	Yeah, my second wife is my third wife.
2665880	2667880	Wow.
2667880	2668880	That could be like a...
2668880	2670880	After a 10-year gap.
2670880	2674880	Yeah, that would be a fun, like, latter-day Matt Damon movie.
2674880	2675880	You know.
2675880	2677880	Second, third wife.
2679880	2680880	She's...
2680880	2683880	Yeah, who would be the wife in that?
2683880	2687880	The born-to-lose.
2688880	2690880	Like, born identity? I don't know.
2690880	2691880	Oh, oh, oh.
2691880	2693880	I thought you were trying to make up an actress's name.
2693880	2694880	Born-to-lose.
2694880	2696880	Born-to-lose.
2696880	2698880	Is this roller derby?
2700880	2701880	Here comes born-to-lose.
2701880	2704880	Shindiggers taking it in the crotch.
2704880	2706880	Zilla's got it up on the wall.
2710880	2712880	What is it?
2712880	2717880	I just read an article about when to know when to stop going to therapy.
2717880	2718880	When you're done.
2718880	2719880	Yeah.
2719880	2720880	And I thought that was...
2720880	2723880	I felt weird opening the article, but then I felt immediately great
2723880	2727880	because the article and the professionals cited within it
2727880	2730880	all immediately indicated,
2730880	2734880	this is going to make you feel weird having this conversation with yourself
2734880	2735880	or with your...
2735880	2739880	Like, and here's why and here's whatever.
2739880	2740880	Have you...
2740880	2742880	I mean, what's your relationship been with therapy?
2742880	2743880	Well, my...
2743880	2744880	It was really...
2744880	2746880	Literally, one day, I was at...
2746880	2748880	We were in the middle of a session
2748880	2749880	and the therapist said,
2749880	2752880	you know, you don't have to keep coming.
2752880	2753880	Yeah.
2753880	2756880	And I said, oh, well, I didn't want to offend you.
2758880	2761880	That was her saying that you're good to go?
2761880	2763880	Yeah, you don't need to be here.
2763880	2765880	And did you stop?
2765880	2766880	Yeah.
2766880	2767880	That was the last session.
2767880	2768880	That's great.
2768880	2769880	So she's like, you nailed it.
2769880	2770880	Yeah, you don't need to be here.
2770880	2772880	That's a little sad because I mean, but if you're a therapist,
2772880	2775880	birth your salt, you do understand going into the job,
2775880	2776880	which is something I wouldn't have known.
2776880	2777880	I'm a little more cynical than that.
2777880	2779880	I would think that they're just like,
2779880	2781880	they never even confront this idea,
2781880	2782880	but they're actually like,
2782880	2785880	if they want to be a good therapist, they're thinking,
2785880	2788880	my job is to make it so this person never has to come see me again.
2788880	2789880	And it's an intimate...
2789880	2792880	It's kind of like a prostitute
2792880	2795880	in that it's an intimate thing, you know, having this guy.
2795880	2798880	And also I found you're not supposed to kiss them on the mouth.
2798880	2800880	Right.
2800880	2802880	And they're called mental health workers now.
2802880	2803880	Yeah.
2803880	2805880	Yeah.
2805880	2808880	Also a prostitute psychologist can blow your mind.
2808880	2811880	Yeah.
2811880	2812880	Yeah.
2812880	2817880	That was a nice groan, groan, groan applause.
2822880	2824880	Oh, I've got more.
2824880	2827880	That was problem a top laws.
2827880	2831880	They were like, hey.
2832880	2835880	Sad Ponzi.
2841880	2845880	Yeah, I think the signs are,
2845880	2848880	if you have internalized everything,
2848880	2851880	so you kind of just hear your therapist's voice in your head a lot
2851880	2852880	in situations where you're like,
2852880	2854880	oh, this is what she would say about this.
2854880	2856880	And if you're when you're going into your sessions,
2856880	2858880	you're kind of like starting to make shit up,
2858880	2860880	like reasons to be there.
2860880	2861880	Stuff to talk about.
2861880	2863880	Spencer, have you ever gone to a therapist?
2863880	2864880	Oh, yeah.
2864880	2865880	I love it.
2865880	2866880	How's that going?
2866880	2867880	I wish my therapist would be like,
2867880	2870880	you know, you don't have to get it coming.
2870880	2874880	Spencer is seeing Jeremy Piven as a therapist.
2874880	2875880	Oh, it's great.
2875880	2877880	He just wants him to get a haircut
2877880	2880880	and stop playing Dungeons and Dragons.
2880880	2882880	Do you currently go, Spencer?
2882880	2883880	Oh, yeah.
2883880	2884880	I'm going to go tomorrow.
2884880	2885880	Oh, boy.
2885880	2887880	What's going on with that?
2887880	2890880	Tell us something really intimate about your therapy.
2890880	2894880	I was talking about how, oh, the most interesting,
2894880	2897880	probably the most valuable thing my therapist ever said
2897880	2898880	happened at last session.
2898880	2901880	He's like, you know, you seem to be alone a lot.
2901880	2903880	And I was like, thank you.
2903880	2906880	This is what I'm trying to tell people.
2906880	2909880	And it was like, it was probably the first time
2909880	2913880	I got what felt like a genuine valuable insight from him
2913880	2915880	because most of the time I go to therapy,
2915880	2917880	I'm like, blah, blah, blah.
2917880	2918880	And he's like, you know.
2918880	2920880	And I'm like, yeah, no, I know that.
2920880	2922880	And then I'm like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2922880	2923880	And he's like, you know.
2923880	2925880	And I'm like, that's a stupid observation.
2925880	2927880	But this is the first time I was like, hey,
2927880	2929880	that's the kind of thing your therapist would say,
2929880	2932880	would you give them money to talk about shit?
2932880	2933880	That you're alone a lot.
2933880	2934880	Well, just, yeah.
2934880	2936880	Was there a follow up to that?
2936880	2937880	No.
2937880	2938880	I was like, come on.
2938880	2939880	What the fuck?
2939880	2940880	That's all?
2940880	2941880	I've been here so many times.
2941880	2944880	That's like the one grain of rice you give me.
2944880	2947880	This is literally, he's as therapeutic as a bully.
2947880	2949880	He's saying all the same things a bully says.
2949880	2950880	He's telling you to cut your hair.
2950880	2952880	No bully has told me I'm alone a lot.
2952880	2953880	I'd love to hear that.
2953880	2954880	You don't have any friends.
2954880	2955880	Cut your hair.
2955880	2956880	He only says that.
2956880	2957880	I'd love to hear that.
2957880	2959880	He only knows you when he's with you.
2959880	2961880	So you're never alone when you're with, like,
2961880	2962880	he only knows you not being alone.
2962880	2965880	You going to that asshole, Jordan Peterson, for therapy?
2965880	2967880	Yeah, I've been cleaning my room.
2967880	2968880	You know your room.
2968880	2969880	Stand up straight.
2969880	2971880	You know what lobsters do?
2971880	2972880	Huh?
2972880	2973880	You know what lobsters do?
2973880	2974880	What do they do?
2974880	2976880	When their friends are in a bucket,
2976880	2979880	they have dominance hierarchies.
2979880	2981880	It's some JP stuff.
2981880	2984880	Lobsters have friends in a bucket.
2984880	2985880	You mean like a lobster pot.
2985880	2986880	They're trapped.
2986880	2987880	They're going to get eaten.
2987880	2989880	No, lobster bucket.
2989880	2990880	Yeah, not a trap.
2990880	2991880	It's not a pot.
2991880	2994880	Is that his Plato's cave?
2994880	2999880	Yeah, well, JP has a lot of dominance hierarchy stuff.
2999880	3000880	He's like, it's all just a bucket.
3000880	3002880	Like, who cares which lobster is more red.
3002880	3005880	He's like, all beings have sexism.
3005880	3007880	Look at lobsters.
3007880	3008880	Perfect example.
3008880	3013880	And apparently, he will claim that the dominance hierarchies
3013880	3016880	are a good thing because the best always rise to the top.
3016880	3017880	In lobsters.
3017880	3019880	Yeah, because I don't know if you know this,
3019880	3022880	but Donald Trump's the president.
3022880	3027880	So Jordan, you might want to go back to Canada and shut up.
3027880	3028880	Yeah.
3028880	3031880	Yeah.
3031880	3032880	It's good stuff.
3032880	3036880	JP, JP, would you die for me?
3036880	3041880	As I know, as I say, as I said, except Klaus.
3041880	3043880	I just listened to Jesus Christ Superstar
3043880	3045880	while I was cleaning my video lab.
3045880	3047880	I met Ted Healy.
3047880	3048880	Ted Healy.
3048880	3049880	Ted Healy.
3049880	3050880	Oh, Ted Healy.
3050880	3051880	Jesus.
3051880	3052880	He met Ted Healy.
3052880	3053880	Why would I bring that up?
3053880	3054880	How old are you?
3054880	3056880	What's your video lab?
3056880	3057880	Who's Ted Healy?
3057880	3058880	Jesus.
3058880	3060880	Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
3060880	3061880	He was Jesus.
3061880	3062880	Jesus.
3062880	3063880	Jesus Christ.
3063880	3065880	Stop seeing your therapist.
3065880	3066880	No.
3066880	3067880	My video lab is.
3067880	3068880	Yeah, you should get a better therapist.
3068880	3069880	Let me go to your video lab.
3069880	3070880	Yeah.
3070880	3071880	Yeah, no, I know.
3071880	3076880	I bought eight GoPros, four Sony handcams,
3076880	3078880	and a video switcher.
3078880	3083880	Two cockle shells and a partridge and a pear tree.
3083880	3086880	And I'm figuring out how to do like a live broadcast.
3086880	3091880	And I live broadcast my workouts on Instagram.
3091880	3093880	And I was pointing.
3093880	3096880	With eight GoPros, you can do that bullet time effect.
3096880	3099880	Yeah, 60 frames per second, baby.
3099880	3101880	But yeah, I've been learning.
3101880	3106880	Did you mount the thing inside the pool that we talked about?
3106880	3108880	I got my waterproof housing.
3108880	3112880	Is this like a Chuck Berry story?
3112880	3113880	Yeah, yeah.
3113880	3115880	It's more like a Denny Thomas story.
3115880	3118880	Yeah, I got waterproof cameras so that people can watch me
3118880	3120880	practice my flip turns.
3120880	3122880	It's a little hobby.
3122880	3123880	I'm enjoying it.
3123880	3124880	Wow.
3124880	3127880	Do you think that the filming of your workouts
3127880	3130880	helps you get in better shape as a motivating factor for you?
3130880	3131880	Yeah.
3131880	3133880	I think it's kind of a double-edged sword
3133880	3135880	because that's something I can both get consumed with
3135880	3138880	and I could also get bored with it possibly.
3138880	3143880	But the alternative is I'm not going to just keep working out
3143880	3148880	just because I don't know.
3148880	3152880	I'm playing a semi self-aware game with how my brain works
3152880	3156880	by turning my workouts into a thing that has a nerdy quotient to it.
3156880	3162880	But it's kind of a loaded non-gun or an unloaded actual gun
3162880	3167880	or a double-edged gun sword that shoots little hilt bullets
3167880	3172880	that themselves have no edge but are explosive.
3173880	3177880	In that, yeah, historically I will challenge myself
3177880	3182880	with things that I'm bad at and then I'll learn the fuck out of them
3182880	3185880	for the dopamine spike of conquering this thing
3185880	3189880	and then I'll just get aggressively bored and just walk away.
3189880	3194880	I just opened up Logic Pro today and I had forgotten
3194880	3198880	every single thing that I learned about how to make a little song.
3198880	3200880	I don't remember all the hot keys.
3200880	3203880	It's like, why did I spend all that time learning?
3203880	3205880	Have you got the dive good yet?
3205880	3207880	Because you were doing the floppy legs thing.
3207880	3209880	Have you got the dive ripped?
3209880	3211880	I like to think I'm keeping my legs a little straighter.
3211880	3213880	I had some floppy legs on my dives.
3213880	3214880	I guess so, yeah.
3214880	3219880	You know what I started doing, Dave, is I took off my nose clip.
3219880	3221880	Oh, that's a big workout.
3221880	3222880	On the flips?
3222880	3223880	That's big boy stuff.
3223880	3224880	Do you have to breathe out?
3224880	3225880	You can't do the flips yet.
3225880	3228880	That's like wasabi in the nose when I flip.
3228880	3230880	You got to breathe out, I guess, or something.
3230880	3232880	Yeah, you got to get to the end.
3232880	3235880	Yeah, you exhale when you're going upside down.
3235880	3236880	Oh, really?
3236880	3238880	Yeah.
3238880	3240880	I should try that.
3240880	3243880	There's no air in my lungs, brother.
3243880	3246880	I've just swam a whole pool length.
3246880	3249880	Coach also wants you to work on those floppy legs.
3249880	3258880	Any who, were you ever in a comedy troupe, Spencer?
3258880	3259880	Oh, yeah.
3259880	3264880	I was on this podcast called Harmontown.
3264880	3266880	Oh, I guess they've heard of it.
3266880	3269880	I heard it died after 17 years.
3269880	3270880	Yeah.
3270880	3273880	A lot of fighting, a lot of notes.
3273880	3276880	Yeah, what people don't know is after every Harmontown,
3276880	3279880	we go back into the green room and really fucking get into it.
3279880	3286880	We talk about the minutia of every joke is under a microscope.
3286880	3287880	Yeah.
3287880	3288880	It's all punch up, though.
3288880	3289880	It's good.
3289880	3290880	Right.
3290880	3292880	It makes it better.
3292880	3293880	Yeah.
3293880	3294880	Look how good the show is.
3294880	3296880	How many shows do we have left?
3296880	3299880	What's the shot clock on right now?
3299880	3301880	What's today?
3301880	3302880	Seven?
3302880	3303880	It's Monday.
3303880	3305880	We got maybe eight shows left.
3305880	3306880	All right.
3306880	3309880	I can only do eight of them.
3309880	3312880	Hell, yeah.
3312880	3314880	That's all I made record.
3314880	3316880	Did you ever play any D&D, Dave?
3316880	3318880	I've never played D&D.
3318880	3323880	You want to try and be a little like a guest character and a little role-playing?
3323880	3324880	D&D, sure.
3324880	3338880	D&D and video games both kind of broke when I was a kid just after I started having sex.
3338880	3339880	Right.
3339880	3340880	That's a bad timing.
3340880	3342880	There was just no turning back from there.
3342880	3344880	Do you think there was a correlation there?
3344880	3345880	I think so, yeah.
3345880	3349880	That you created D&D and video games by fucking people?
3349880	3351880	Other people would say, hey, have you heard about this D&D?
3351880	3357880	I said, I'd love to hear about it, but I'm fucking right now.
3357880	3358880	Well, what about some video games?
3358880	3359880	Same deal.
3359880	3361880	I got some fucking to do.
3361880	3363880	When I'm done, maybe we can talk about it.
3363880	3364880	So what year are we talking?
3364880	3365880	Early 80s?
3365880	3367880	This is late 70s, I guess.
3367880	3368880	Late 70s?
3368880	3369880	Well, I guess eight.
3369880	3371880	No, I lasted my virginity in 1980, I guess.
3371880	3374880	So you were hitting that early hip-hop pussy.
3374880	3375880	Yeah.
3375880	3376880	Oh, yeah.
3376880	3379880	That Sugar Hill gang.
3379880	3381880	Rapping about peas and carrots.
3381880	3382880	Yeah.
3382880	3383880	Look at me.
3383880	3385880	He was fucking to Melly Mel.
3385880	3386880	Yeah.
3386880	3387880	Yeah.
3387880	3388880	See?
3388880	3389880	Nobody laughed because it's too fucking deep a track.
3389880	3390880	Yeah.
3390880	3394880	I was fucking to Pink Floyd's The Wall, which is really quite a...
3394880	3399880	If you can stay erect during anything by Roger Waters.
3399880	3404880	If your lover can stay in a relationship with a guy who's playing...
3404880	3408880	Pink Floyd, because all his songs are about his mommy letting him down after his daddy
3408880	3409880	died.
3409880	3413880	Has anybody achieved orgasm during Pink Floyd, or is that impossible?
3413880	3414880	Only Roger Waters.
3414880	3415880	Only Roger Waters.
3415880	3416880	Only Roger Waters.
3416880	3417880	Did I talk about this in the last show?
3417880	3421880	Because I had written this down as a note, but I'm usually blackout drunk by the middle
3421880	3422880	of the show.
3422880	3425880	But did I mention the thing?
3425880	3427880	Do you think Pink Floyd had a manager?
3427880	3431880	And so many Pink Floyd songs have a cigar, but it's such a theme in Pink Floyd songs
3431880	3435880	where they go meta and talk about how shitty the record business is and showbiz and all
3435880	3436880	this stuff.
3436880	3440880	You think they had a really nice manager, who's like, guys.
3440880	3441880	Yeah.
3441880	3442880	Yeah.
3442880	3446880	Like, I thought we got along and they're like, no, it's a thing.
3446880	3450880	Well, you're perpetuating a stereotype about my vocation.
3450880	3454880	Are you not happy with the hotel?
3454880	3456880	What am I not doing?
3456880	3458880	Do you think that I'm only interested in money?
3458880	3460880	I care about you.
3460880	3462880	I like that the job pays.
3462880	3463880	Yeah.
3463880	3464880	I'm pretty transparent about it.
3464880	3470880	I hear this latest single and I'm like, is that an impression of me?
3470880	3472880	You wanted to do a concert in Pompeii.
3472880	3474880	I said, okay.
3474880	3478880	I finished my pudding.
3478880	3483880	Why am I one of these characters coming out and putting your soul on trial with your
3483880	3485880	mom and your English professor?
3485880	3486880	That's crazy.
3486880	3487880	Come on.
3487880	3491880	I never shot you up with heroin, turned you into a Nazi with shaved eyebrows.
3491880	3494880	I didn't do that.
3494880	3495880	They went?
3495880	3497880	Well, just Pink Floyd references.
3497880	3501880	I only know, I don't know a whole lot of Pink Floyd.
3501880	3502880	I got to be honest.
3502880	3507880	I'm pretty proud that by 1981, I realized that the wall was shit.
3507880	3508880	I think that was pretty fast.
3508880	3510880	I think that was pretty fast off the mark.
3510880	3512880	I would never go that far.
3512880	3516880	I'm afraid I probably will never reach that apotheosis.
3516880	3518880	I'm 46 and I'm...
3518880	3520880	Oh, it's a terrible album.
3520880	3524880	Well, if you take out all the Roger Waters songs, it's not bad.
3524880	3526880	Oh, come on.
3526880	3527880	All right.
3527880	3530880	Canadian shots fires down you.
3530880	3531880	I love it.
3531880	3532880	I never...
3532880	3535880	I never like...
3535880	3537880	I won't bother to like...
3537880	3542880	Because I feel like my taste in music is so unqualified and bad that I'm afraid of
3542880	3545880	the glass house of like ever saying...
3545880	3549880	I'll be like, this Katy Perry song is fine.
3549880	3554880	Like I'm afraid if I step on the slightest footstool of snobbery, like I'll
3554880	3558880	immediately do a triple flip and break my neck because people will be like,
3558880	3559880	what do you listen to?
3559880	3561880	And I'll be like, nah, don't look at those underwear.
3561880	3563880	Like, I don't know.
3563880	3567880	Brian Posein came up to me and said, hey, I heard you have a bit where you can talk
3567880	3570880	anybody out of their love of Rush.
3570880	3572880	And he goes, I fucking love Rush.
3572880	3575880	I go, I can't talk Brian Posein out of loving Rush.
3575880	3578880	I could talk anybody else out of loving Rush.
3578880	3581880	Because Brian Posein loves his Rush, but wow.
3581880	3583880	I'll say it yet with Alex Leifson sometime.
3583880	3584880	With who?
3584880	3585880	The guitar player from Rush.
3585880	3586880	Oh, really?
3586880	3589880	See, I hate you for even knowing that.
3589880	3593880	I remember being in the car with you and Jack Black and then like some Led Zeppelin
3593880	3595880	came up and you're like, Led Zeppelin sucks.
3595880	3603880	And you talk for like two minutes and then Jack Black was like, nah.
3603880	3605880	And it was so unmistakable.
3605880	3607880	You're just like, all right, well, that's fine.
3607880	3612880	I have no leg to stand on.
3612880	3618880	I have no credentials because I know and like Styx more than the Pink Floyd.
3618880	3621880	And they're a worse band.
3621880	3625880	Yeah, they are a worse band no matter what the other band you're talking about is.
3625880	3628880	It is.
3628880	3633880	Well, if Styx and Pink Floyd are bad, then what's good?
3634880	3637880	I got to go see Styx.
3637880	3639880	I saw Styx live.
3639880	3641880	Are they Canadian? No.
3641880	3643880	I saw them on the crystal ball tour.
3643880	3644880	Where are Styx from?
3644880	3645880	America.
3645880	3647880	They're yours.
3647880	3652880	I got invited by Diva Zappa to go see them at the Greek.
3652880	3657880	And they opened for yes, who I truly hate.
3657880	3660880	They're the worst of prog rock.
3660880	3666880	I would rather suck Geddy Lee's balls than go to a yes concert.
3666880	3670880	And we were backstage and I asked Tommy, what's his name?
3670880	3675880	Tommy Shaw, who took over from the other guy that used to be the lead singer.
3675880	3677880	And I go, yes, it's on.
3677880	3678880	You don't want to go watch him?
3678880	3682880	And he goes, nah, I've seen him.
3682880	3683880	Yeah.
3683880	3684880	Fuck yes.
3684880	3685880	Yeah.
3685880	3686880	I mean, fuck no.
3686880	3688880	Tiffany, do you want to think of a band that I hate?
3688880	3690880	A song that like, nope, nope, nope, nope.
3690880	3691880	No, no, that's Styx.
3691880	3692880	What's the fucking one?
3692880	3693880	Roundabout.
3693880	3694880	Okay.
3694880	3696880	Roundabout is a yes song.
3696880	3699880	I only feel that way about like, like, like, like.
3699880	3700880	I was renegaded.
3700880	3704880	Like, there's bands and singers that I recognize are good.
3704880	3707880	Because again, I have no confidence in my own taste.
3707880	3710880	But I hate them the way I hate Apocalypse Now and stuff like that.
3710880	3714880	Where I resent the idea that I'm not allowed to not be leveled in.
3714880	3715880	Like Elvis Costello.
3715880	3717880	I have, I don't, I don't, I don't.
3717880	3718880	Hold on.
3718880	3719880	I don't hate Elvis Costello.
3719880	3724880	But I, I hate the phenomenon of not being allowed to hate Elvis Costello.
3724880	3727880	I like a couple Elvis Costello songs.
3727880	3728880	You love Elvis Costello.
3728880	3733880	But here's where the Elvis Costello, I heard quote, saying that, called Led Zeppelin.
3733880	3736880	I believe he called them egregious charlatans.
3736880	3737880	Wow.
3737880	3738880	Yeah.
3738880	3740880	I just, he pushes through his nose too much.
3740880	3741880	It's so nasal.
3741880	3747880	It's so fucking nasal.
3747880	3749880	Well, I guess goodbye Bob Dylan too.
3749880	3752880	I fucking hate Bob Dylan.
3752880	3756880	Bob Dylan is a fucking fraud and a fucking plagiarist to fuck Bob Dylan.
3756880	3757880	Oh shit.
3757880	3758880	Damn it.
3758880	3759880	I mean.
3759880	3761880	Give me sticks any day.
3761880	3762880	Yeah.
3762880	3763880	Sticks?
3763880	3767880	First concert ever I ever bought a joint at was at Sticks.
3767880	3768880	Huh?
3768880	3772880	The first time I ever bought drugs at a concert was at Sticks when I was 16.
3772880	3773880	It's good for you.
3773880	3774880	Good for you.
3774880	3775880	Yeah.
3775880	3776880	What kind of drugs was it?
3776880	3777880	I bought weed.
3777880	3778880	Yeah.
3778880	3779880	I bought some rolled joints.
3779880	3780880	Classic.
3780880	3781880	From a dude behind me.
3781880	3784160	He said, hey dude, you got some extra joints you can sell?
3784160	3785460	Was that dude a robot?
3785460	3788880	And did you say domo arigato to him?
3788880	3792320	Sticks doesn't sing that in concert anymore because they're ashamed of that song.
3792320	3793320	They actually don't.
3793320	3794320	Well then fuck them.
3794320	3795320	They don't do fucking Roboto.
3795320	3796320	Fuck Sticks.
3796320	3797320	What's Japanese for?
3797320	3798320	That's cause they're afraid of robots.
3798320	3799960	Thank you.
3799960	3801840	No domo arigato.
3801840	3802840	No mo arigato.
3802840	3803840	No mo.
3803840	3804840	No.
3804840	3805840	That's good.
3805840	3806840	Yeah.
3806840	3807840	See, here's the thing.
3807840	3812680	The Tao Te Ching says if some things become beautiful, other things become ugly, like
3812680	3817280	when you're talking about music, if there's such a thing as a shitty band and oh, this
3817280	3823160	music sucks, then I like Phil Collins, but I recognize probably along with Phil Collins
3823160	3831760	that like 85% of his stuff is like styrofoam and who knows about the last 15%, but he's
3831760	3839200	prolific and he wouldn't be able to be if he listened to these thoughts that you're
3839200	3840960	giving voice to when you talk about music.
3840960	3843640	I was just in Vegas and we drove by Ellis Island.
3843640	3848980	We must have talked about it on the show, but Dan sang Su Su Studio and took his shirt
3848980	3851800	off during the song.
3851800	3860680	P.D. came in, then Las Vegas P.D. came in and Dan had to change his clothes like Sylvester
3860680	3865600	Stallone and Victory, where he had to sneak him out of the fucking arena.
3865600	3869840	Which aren't you allowed to do, take your shirt off or sing Su Su Studio?
3869840	3875200	The shirt off, which I was so surprised by until I really thought about it.
3875200	3878720	Because you're being goaded on by the woman that ran the bar, like the bartender.
3878720	3881000	She was like hyping you up kind of, right?
3881000	3882000	Did she work there?
3882000	3886880	There was an older woman, she had a cigarette dangling from her mouth.
3886880	3893400	There were two racist women, there was a mother and daughter team who were virulently racist,
3893400	3898160	who were talking shit about this very handsome black guy who was wearing a nice suit and
3898160	3903840	they were saying awful, awful racist stuff, but clearly the mother wanted to fuck the
3903840	3905520	black guy.
3905520	3909680	And then some college kids came in and sat on the front table and it was me, you, Nick
3909680	3916640	Vinay, Sam Simon of Simpsons fame, Schwab was there, a couple of the people.
3916640	3920240	And then Dan got up and started singing Su Studio.
3920240	3926720	And he was being kind of peppered on by I think either the bartender or the karaoke.
3926720	3931520	It was a fairly empty place and then there was like one kind of senior woman who had
3931520	3936880	this kind of charisma to her because she was like into it and so she came up to the foot
3936880	3941400	of the stage and was like kind of dancing to me doing Su Studio and she was encouraging
3941400	3945440	me and I was playing to her and then she said like take it off or something like that.
3945440	3947880	And so Dan sort of kind of sexually, slowly like.
3947880	3949880	So being a long form improviser.
3949880	3950880	Yeah.
3950880	3953640	Started taking his shirt off and now the crowd has gone.
3953640	3954640	Lock, yeah.
3954640	3956640	The crowd has gone potty.
3956640	3957640	Now it's fucking hype.
3957640	3963800	Then the security guard comes in and he goes, hey, you can't, you can't, yeah, well I was
3963800	3965040	taking my pants off as well.
3965040	3966040	Yeah, we're there.
3966680	3971600	Dan got completely shirtless and now the eight college kids, the two racist ladies, the black
3971600	3975320	guy, everybody was freaking out and it was really good.
3975320	3980320	And then two security guards come in wearing yellow shirts and they had like mace.
3980320	3982280	I feel like and the hand was over the mace.
3982280	3983280	On a taser.
3983280	3986580	Yeah, they came out, not weapons drawn, but weapons at the ready.
3986580	3990080	And here was my mistake and I know I've told the story of the podcast before, but he said
3990080	3991400	we might as well finish it.
3991400	3992840	Here was my mistake, Dave Foley.
3992840	3993840	All right.
3993880	3996520	Security came in and as soon as they said like, you can't do that.
3996520	3997720	You can't take our clothes off in here.
3997720	4001720	And I was like, as soon as they said that I was like mortified, I was like, oh, okay.
4001720	4002720	I didn't, I didn't.
4002720	4009680	I started putting my clothes back on and then I, I misguided, like I thought I would do
4009680	4016200	a bit that in this mistaken world where I live and where everyone shares my entire vocabulary
4016200	4022200	of references, I thought I would do an impression of Bono in the YouTube video where they're
4022200	4025480	getting shut down by the police on the rooftop.
4025480	4029360	And as I thought the security guards would have a laugh and everyone laughed because
4029360	4035640	I was like, it looks like they're trying to shut us down, but no one got the reference.
4035640	4037960	They thought I was being completely sincere.
4037960	4046480	But that was the tipping point that they were like, let them dance, just let them dance.
4046480	4054840	And in this Christmas tree of bad decision-making, the security guards take that to heart and
4054840	4058360	start engaging with the hecklers and going like, hey, I don't tell you how to do your
4058360	4059360	job.
4059360	4061200	And then the people are like, what job?
4061200	4062200	You fucking pig.
4062200	4067120	But the woman, the elderly racist woman that was trying to fuck the black guy, even though
4067120	4072240	she kept dropping like horrible, like epithets at him whenever he walked away, she spit on
4072240	4075840	one of the security guards and that's when things went fucking her way.
4075840	4079280	And they start clearing out the entire fucking bar.
4079280	4087640	Six LVPD, like a proper policeman came barging in and now these people have guns and the
4087640	4096200	While all this is happening, I'm on the karaoke stage, which is ironically now in the background.
4096200	4103720	And a like an incredibly impressively like strategic Rob Schwab in this like shining
4103720	4104720	moment.
4105040	4110240	I just feel this hand grab my wrist and he just goes like, come on.
4110240	4114920	And he just pulled me over to the giant booth and they tried to have a hat and jacket.
4114920	4121740	Changing clothes like if you ever seen the movie Victory with Michael Caine and Sylvester
4121740	4126080	Stallone in Pele, they changed clothes.
4126080	4130600	And Bra put his beanie on like, we have to get you out of here, but you can't be wearing
4130600	4132560	the same clothes that you were wearing.
4132560	4133820	And Sam Simon was there.
4133820	4140700	And now that the college kids, the woman spit on a police, on a security officer.
4140700	4142420	Then the police came.
4142420	4145900	Now the kids were like, hey, let him sing.
4145900	4147340	And they came to your rescue.
4147340	4149260	These like, like fratty kind of sorority.
4149260	4150260	Everybody was.
4150260	4151260	Yeah, it was.
4151260	4157020	And so now we're hiding in the background and now there's a melee like a shit went wild
4157020	4162500	and we sneaked out the back and now we walk out and there's loads of cop cars outside
4162500	4165100	and we're slithering down the side of the building at Ellis Island.
4165100	4168700	People were being coughed on hoods because they cleared the bar out.
4168700	4171100	Everyone's like, well, can I just have a fucking good time?
4171100	4173780	Why is that against the law?
4173780	4175420	Everyone had completely forgotten you.
4175420	4178500	And the woman that spit on the cop, she's like, you can't kick me out of here.
4178500	4182300	Like the daughter goes, you can't throw her out.
4182300	4183300	She's my mother.
4183300	4185140	And he goes, you're out of here too.
4185140	4188500	And then the fucking fratty's got in there and the sorority's got in there and then it
4188500	4189980	was fucking chaos.
4189980	4192980	And we used that distraction to get out of there.
4192980	4197620	And the black guy in the suit's like, I thought I was already paying the price for this relationship.
4197620	4202780	So we're leaving Ellis Island, which is a terrible, terrible casino, but they have
4202780	4204180	karaoke every night.
4204180	4210380	There's like an Asian Elvis and a black Elvis and a fat Elvis and a wheelchair.
4210380	4212580	But they don't even know Elvis songs.
4212580	4213580	They just know how to dress up like Elvis.
4213580	4215220	They don't even know Elvis was a guy.
4215220	4219020	They just think that that's how you dress when you're successful in Las Vegas.
4219020	4224660	So we're leaving and Sam Simon, our dearly departed friend who awesomely made Simpsons
4224660	4228100	a thing, we're leaving and there's police everywhere.
4228100	4233220	And the college kids are being thrown over the hood and being cuffed.
4233220	4236980	Like we're staying here at the Best Western or whatever the fucking shit hotel is there.
4236980	4239460	And they're like, no, you're going to jail.
4239460	4248020	And Sam Simon goes, yeah, but what about the guy that took his shirt off during Phil Collins?
4248020	4249780	We'd be looking for him.
4249780	4255780	And we had to walk like a half a mile to go to the fucking like, like some other hotel
4255780	4256780	that used to be the maximum.
4256780	4258240	Now it's like the Western suites.
4258240	4262060	We had to walk a mile to go get a cab because we couldn't get one there.
4262060	4263740	And it was, yeah, that's good.
4263740	4265740	It's good karaoke.
4265740	4269540	Yeah, yeah.
4269540	4272500	That's probably the third time in eight years.
4272500	4276660	I probably told the story into the record, but like, you know, I always wondered how
4276660	4280180	the Vegas riot started.
4280180	4288180	But what of all songs to start some inflammatory, awful shit, SuSudio is the most anodyne like
4288180	4290420	fucking nonsense.
4290420	4294660	But the reason why that all kicked off is because you were nailing it.
4294660	4300700	You were so good at it that people were encouraging you to be nude.
4300700	4306220	One person.
4306220	4312300	When I was like 35, whatever I was, it was funnier to me in my underwear.
4312300	4313300	It was funnier.
4313300	4316860	Now, now I think it's like a little creepy problem.
4316860	4323740	I took my clothes off at the Traverse City Comedy Festival and nothing happened.
4323740	4324740	There was no incident.
4324740	4326700	No, no, no, people just get it.
4326700	4329260	People just had a good time.
4329260	4330260	Fully full naked.
4330260	4331260	Oh, yeah.
4331260	4332260	Yeah.
4332260	4333260	Cock out.
4333260	4334260	Yeah.
4334260	4338780	Did you cover it?
4338780	4340180	Did you like cup your hands over it?
4340180	4341180	No, no, no.
4341180	4342180	That was the whole point.
4342180	4345260	There was someone in the audience who started to take it off and everyone started cheering
4345260	4347300	and they went, all right, fuck it.
4347300	4349540	I was still drinking in those days.
4349540	4352500	What's it like down there?
4352500	4353500	What's the deal?
4353500	4354500	Be honest.
4354500	4357620	In your objective appraisal.
4357620	4365060	Be graphic and honest about your genitals.
4365060	4369620	Because I've heard that your penis is shaped exactly like an ampersand.
4369620	4376260	I'm trying to think the best way.
4376260	4386220	I'm fluctuating between adorable and beneficent.
4386220	4387220	That's the sweet spot.
4387820	4394460	My penis looks like a third nipple perched on top of two pendulous tumors.
4394460	4399060	Because Dan has enormous balls.
4399060	4404700	You have conspicuous balls.
4404700	4409300	Or they may look enormous because as Ryan Ridley has said, it's like a bus parked next
4409300	4410300	to the up top center.
4410300	4417180	I'm not saying even by contrast, I'm saying you have a small dick, but your balls are
4417180	4418180	needlessly large.
4418180	4419180	There's no...
4419180	4420180	I know.
4420180	4421180	It's like, what's the deal?
4421180	4422180	What are you going to do with them?
4422180	4423180	Exactly.
4423180	4433180	We discussed with Heather Ann Campbell, I've never dropped what I would call a load.
4433180	4441180	I'll emit a desperate dime-sized...
4441180	4444180	But your balls are the size...
4445180	4450180	If you bifurcated a cantaloupe and made two balls out of it.
4450180	4453180	It looks like a cantaloupe, but with a cleft.
4453180	4459180	You have giant, giant, giant testicles.
4459180	4469180	Picture Garfield the cat, his eyes, and then a little dick in between them.
4469180	4474180	If Garfield's nose was on top of his eyes.
4474180	4476180	Or if Garfield's just upside down.
4476180	4480180	Just picture two big balls and a little dick.
4480180	4481180	You could probably do that.
4481180	4485180	You would think, though, that you would have dropped larger loads.
4485180	4490180	Yeah, you'd think I would come like buckets and be like, that's how you make up for it.
4490180	4493180	I'm out of the sentence.
4494180	4497180	Whose response would that be?
4497180	4500180	His dick was little, but so much comes.
4500180	4503180	Well, ostensibly...
4503180	4504180	I guess God.
4504180	4510180	Whatever maniac is behind all these decisions, it's just like, well, I want to find out.
4510180	4511180	How do you know?
4511180	4512180	You're going to play with these attributes.
4512180	4515180	Ladies love a good drenching.
4515180	4520180	From a little dick troll.
4520180	4524180	There's certainly a market for tiny dick and too much cum.
4524180	4530180	I have a penis that usually gets this response, oh, so much better than I was expecting.
4530180	4532180	Oh, I thought I was going to have to be polite.
4532180	4534180	Because you don't expect much from me.
4534180	4536180	Because you're beneficent.
4536180	4537180	Yeah.
4537180	4539180	You're like a pope.
4539180	4544180	I'm so not sexy in general that it's a pleasant surprise.
4544180	4556180	If they've heard my rhetoric leading to their maiden voyage, boudoir.
4556180	4559180	There's no foreplay like rhetoricians.
4559180	4566180	They'll be like, oh, I was actually anticipating a micropenis situation, clinically small.
4566180	4569180	And shout out to my micropenis listeners.
4569180	4582180	I find it, you know, like I don't, I mean, look, I don't like dick size being bandied about as a metric.
4582180	4583180	How about this?
4583180	4584180	Everyone here with a micropenis stand up.
4584180	4586180	Get a round of applause.
4586180	4593180	You're good people, micropenises.
4593180	4597180	Only women stood up.
4597180	4606180	Finally, my giant clitoris can be contextualized in a, well, we've gone too far, haven't we?
4606180	4607180	Have we?
4607180	4610180	It's that time in the show.
4610180	4616180	The thing is now that we're ticking down to the dying days of Harman Town.
4616180	4617180	Yeah.
4617180	4622180	Let's not leave anything, any stone unturned.
4622180	4624180	This is like the death rattle?
4624180	4626180	Yeah, it is.
4626180	4630180	I'm glad you came here for the death rattle, Dave Foley.
4630180	4632180	Basically, that's my career.
4632180	4637180	Dave Foley, can I, one of my favorite things about you, because Dave Foley loves coffee.
4637180	4639180	Are you currently drinking coffee?
4639180	4640180	I was.
4640180	4642180	This was full of coffee when I came out here.
4642180	4644180	This is the only time I've seen you without coffee.
4644180	4647180	Yeah, this is why I ran out and I didn't plan to get it.
4647180	4653180	What was the thing when you were on news radio and you got in the Inquirer?
4653180	4656180	My only time in the Inquirer, yeah.
4656180	4657180	What was the headline?
4657180	4663180	It said, Dave Foley admits to drinking 50 cups of coffee a day, which I wouldn't consider
4663180	4666180	a huge admission, but it was true.
4666180	4669180	My favorite is that also Dave has trouble sleeping.
4669180	4671180	Yeah.
4671180	4676180	And Greg Proops on the Road is like, you know that if you drink less coffee, you're like,
4676180	4680180	hey, if I wanted to hear this shit, I could get this to home.
4680180	4684180	Is there a correlation or were you already insomniac before you drank coffee?
4684180	4687180	I've been an insomniac since I was about like four years old.
4687180	4688180	So pre-coffee or insomnia?
4688180	4691180	Yeah, I was a worried four-year-old.
4691180	4694180	What was your main worry at four years old?
4694180	4696180	Global warming.
4696180	4698180	Ahead of your time.
4698180	4701180	Do you have nightmares when you do sleep?
4701180	4706180	Insomnia, I feel like people misunderstand it, because to me, it sounds like a superpower.
4706180	4708180	I hate falling asleep.
4708180	4711180	I'm like, God damn it, I was just getting into this.
4711180	4712180	I have trouble sleeping at night.
4712180	4713180	I can sleep in the day easily.
4713180	4714180	I love sleeping in the day.
4714180	4716180	I just have trouble sleeping at night.
4716180	4719180	Yeah, on the van or the tour bus, you can sack right out.
4719180	4720180	Yeah, I'm good at napping.
4720180	4721180	You're a good napper.
4721180	4723180	Yeah, but at night I sort of stay up and just...
4723180	4726180	If you get some Rachel Maddow and some headphones, you're good to go.
4726180	4727180	Yes.
4727180	4728180	Yes.
4728180	4729180	That's my...
4729180	4732180	MSNBC and a cup of coffee, they're full of ready to go.
4732180	4736180	Because it's comforting, because I know that I can fall asleep during one show, and then
4736180	4737180	we'll say the exact same thing.
4737180	4738180	Right.
4738180	4740180	So I don't have to worry about missing anything.
4740180	4744180	I'll get Chris Hayes' take, and then I'll wake up to Maddow's.
4744180	4745180	Wait, is that the Shouty guy?
4745180	4746180	Who's the Shouty guy?
4746180	4747180	Oh, that's Chris Matthews.
4747180	4749180	Yeah, he's a little crazy.
4749180	4750180	Yeah, I can.
4750180	4751180	He's too yelly.
4751180	4752180	Is 50 Cups an exaggeration?
4752180	4753180	Nope.
4753180	4755180	But is that now not true, or are you still...
4755180	4756180	It's not true.
4756180	4757180	Now I probably...
4757180	4761180	Like today, I've probably had 10 espressos.
4761180	4762180	That seems mathematically...
4763180	4767180	50 Cups seems mathematically impossible, but I guess probably not if you get up and you start...
4767180	4772180	I would have a 10-cup pot of coffee at home before going to work.
4772180	4775180	So that's 10 right there, and then through the day...
4775180	4776180	The prop lady is...
4776180	4777180	I forget their names, because they...
4777180	4778180	Yeah, it's Jodi Mann.
4778180	4779180	Yeah.
4779180	4780180	And she would...
4780180	4785180	They kept two thermoses of coffee on their prop wagon so that I would stop going to get
4785180	4786180	coffee.
4787180	4788180	And they were just pouring...
4788180	4791180	They're the ones who told me, they said, you've had 50 Cups today.
4791180	4792180	Yeah.
4792180	4793180	So that's how I found out I...
4793180	4794180	Is that post-drinking?
4794180	4796180	Well, that's during drinking.
4796180	4797180	Yeah.
4797180	4798180	You mean...
4798180	4799180	I mean, was it like while...
4799180	4800180	You mean after a night of drinking?
4800180	4803180	Well, I mean, some people get sober, and then they...
4803180	4805180	Coffee's there for them.
4805180	4806180	Oh, no.
4806180	4807180	I didn't get sober till like five...
4807180	4808180	It'll be five years ago, Christmas.
4808180	4811180	So coffee was always a thing, and that was just like...
4811180	4812180	Yeah.
4812180	4813180	Well, I knew it was great.
4813180	4817180	It would be coffee up until like 10 o'clock, and then Jodi would start bringing me whiskey.
4817180	4820180	Oh, yeah.
4820180	4821180	They had...
4821180	4824180	When I did the show with John Laracette, they had a little...
4824180	4830420	In the prop fridge, there was a secret picture, and they would go like, we're gonna tell a
4830420	4835420	couple people about this, and they had a cocktail of the week, and so there'd be like cosmopolitans
4835420	4838380	and a picture, and they would just give you a little styrofoam cup, and that was your
4838380	4839380	secret cocktail.
4839380	4840380	Mm-hmm.
4840380	4841780	But that was the same people.
4841780	4845620	But you just said one day, fuck it, and you didn't go through programs, you just said,
4845620	4846620	I quit.
4846620	4847620	Yeah.
4847620	4848620	Yeah, just stopped.
4848620	4849620	Just cold turkey'd it.
4850060	4854460	Oh, I had the advantage of massive brain trauma.
4854460	4855860	Oh, that's right.
4855860	4856860	You broke your fucking...
4856860	4857860	I broke my brain.
4857860	4858860	Yeah.
4858860	4859860	What happened?
4859860	4860860	You fell on the ground?
4860860	4864540	I fell down at the must downtown, which is around the corner from where I lived.
4864540	4865540	And you were found like...
4865540	4866540	And I just laid on...
4866540	4869940	I passed out, fell on the patio, and cracked my head, and I hit...
4869940	4875620	I hit the patio so hard that my brain gave me a black eye from inside my skull.
4875620	4876620	Wow!
4876620	4877620	Oh!
4878620	4887340	And then I woke up in the ICU with my ex-wife and my daughter standing there, and we were
4887340	4892460	going to go to New York after Christmas, and it was one of these words that went, hey,
4892460	4895140	I think I'm going to quit drinking.
4895140	4896140	And...
4896140	4897140	Was there...
4897140	4901100	Yeah, it's like, okay, there's rock bottom, and there's...
4901100	4910940	Is there a positive, kind of like when you're struggling to overcome it, is there kind of...
4910940	4915140	What's the question I'm trying to ask?
4915140	4921140	A realization you had that kind of makes you strong, as opposed to...
4921140	4922140	I don't...
4922140	4923140	No, I don't say...
4923140	4926700	I think it was more just of that, oh, this is fucked up, and I think I'll quit drinking.
4926700	4931780	And at the time, I thought, oh, I might not really do it, because I thought this might
4931780	4934220	be hard.
4934220	4938980	But the brain injury seemed to actually cure me of alcohol.
4938980	4942500	You might be one of these privileged people that fell down while drunk and injured the
4942500	4944140	part of their brain that loves drinking.
4944140	4947420	Yeah, and that's what happened.
4947420	4950780	And also, like, my depression went away, too.
4950780	4951780	What?
4951780	4954220	Yeah, I've been dealing with depression most of my life.
4954220	4956980	Like alfalfa from the art gang.
4956980	4958980	A lot of people become serial killers.
4958980	4962980	Well, yeah, or they suddenly can speak French.
4962980	4965860	People have had head injuries, and then they can play the piano.
4965860	4966860	Sometimes they turn invisible.
4966860	4968660	I mean, that's killing in silent, but...
4968660	4969660	Yeah.
4969660	4970660	Oh, I would have been cool.
4970660	4971660	Oh, man.
4971660	4972660	You got to hit just the right spot.
4972660	4973660	It's not worth trying.
4973660	4974660	I'm going to try it again.
4974660	4976260	No, it's too...
4976260	4981180	The part of your brain that makes you invisible, or keeps you from being invisible, it's nestled
4981180	4983460	right within the part that keeps your heart going.
4984100	4988820	Sometimes I think I'd like to just, like, hit it again with, like, a brick or something,
4988820	4989820	just so I can start drinking again.
4989820	4991820	Just have a Manhattan, and, like, yeah.
4991820	4992820	Just the...
4992820	4995900	Well, because now you know if you get too drunk and get this fail safe.
4995900	4996900	Yeah.
4996900	4997900	Yeah.
4997900	4998900	I think...
4998900	5005500	There was something that my therapist told me about drinking that, to me, was if I ever
5005500	5012100	should choose to stop, like, this would be in the forefront of my brain, which is that
5012100	5018140	when you're 12, which is when I'm going to make a guess, the guys like you and me maybe
5018140	5024820	had our first experiences with drinking with this 12 lickser, and it's like, oh my God,
5024820	5028100	there's this amazing experience, and then your friends are like, yeah, that was kind
5028100	5034020	of fun, but now my head hurts, and you're like, I'm Peter Pan, and, like, when you're
5034020	5043380	15, 17, 19, 25, like, your neurology keeps, like, growing, like, tree roots around this
5043380	5052980	thing, and it very, well, at a certain point, it can not only start to lose its actual benefits,
5052980	5056940	its medicinal benefits, but it actually, I mean, it can lose them entirely.
5056940	5061500	It can become just a plain old poison, and yet the tree roots of your brain have kind
5061500	5068460	of, like, organized themselves in a relationship around the space occupied by this thing, which
5068460	5074140	stops giving you the same kind of, you know, after a while, it's like, well, I'm 46, when
5074140	5082160	I get shit-faced drunk, I am no longer the hilarious person I was, perhaps, I might get
5082160	5090020	more depressed, I might get more blackout, I might lose my memory, it might become, it's
5090020	5094740	a different thing, and I think that part of it, when somebody talks about quitting drinking,
5094740	5101060	like, for me, the part of my brain that resists it is like, yeah, but drinking's always, you know,
5101060	5107220	like, I don't want to make that big change, like, but it's, I think, that's why it's interesting,
5107220	5110980	I thought, for my therapist to point out, like, yeah, but the change has already happened,
5110980	5116660	like, you're already quitting drinking, you already quit that relationship with that wonderful
5116660	5123220	potion that made you happy. That relationship is long since over, and you're dancing with
5123220	5129780	this coffin of this ex-girlfriend that left you a long time ago. She didn't put it that way,
5129780	5133620	I'm very articulate because I'm drunk. I was going to say, a therapist is really poetic.
5134580	5140740	Dancing was the coffin of your ex-girlfriend. She probably said, you know, it's like Stewie,
5140740	5146020	when he did the thing, and then, yeah, my eyes glazed over. The thing was, I think,
5146020	5150260	when you're drunk, it becomes a big part of how you define yourself, too. Right. Like,
5150260	5154660	as when you're a drinker, like, for me, it was, you know, being a drinker and being a hard drinker
5154660	5160020	was a big part of how I, like, how I, you know, what I envision myself to be. And along the way,
5160020	5166020	and I'll say this, not to enable anybody listening or anything, but it is great. But to acknowledge
5166020	5170340	part of the reason why we can get, we can get stuck in our ways is because whether it's smoking
5170340	5176100	video games, drinking or anything, what happens is it brings out behaviors and attitudes in the
5176100	5181300	people around you. So it's not like defining you, it's defining how you relate to other people.
5181300	5185780	Well, that's like, because there was one other time I woke up in a hospital after drinking,
5186420	5190100	but that time I didn't quit drinking. In fact, I woke up and I had an IV in my arm,
5190100	5197220	and I took that out and said, where the hell am I? And was walking out and the doctor,
5197220	5200260	as I was walking out, just said, you know, you really have to quit drinking.
5200260	5204100	And I just announced, first, everyone else has to get a lot more interesting.
5207780	5213940	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that sounds very familiar to me. Yeah. But apparently that happened because
5213940	5220740	now you don't drink anymore. Yeah. Yeah. I always said I drink to make you, all of you smarter or
5221300	5230340	something hilarious like that. But it's like, there's the self-deluded part of that,
5230340	5236900	but then there's also the kind of like, as a former smoker of cigarettes, it's too easy to
5236900	5242580	just say, oh, I was doing this terrible thing by smoking and then I stopped and it was a zero-sum
5242580	5247220	game. It's like, while I was a smoker, there were many positive things to say about it. And they
5247220	5252580	were all socially based because the kinds of people who would get on your ass about how you
5252580	5258820	were a smoker, that was a red flag for the kind of relationship that I didn't bother to engage in.
5258820	5264340	And it's like, I don't think I was denying myself the friendship of people that would have made my
5264340	5271700	life better. Yeah. Well, every friendship and relationship I had started drunk. Right. Like,
5271700	5278260	every woman I was ever with, it started out drinking and every friendship I think started
5278260	5285380	out drinking after the age of about 14. And so it was very beneficial for a long, long time.
5285380	5288980	What's the world's oldest medicine? I mean, it really was a medicine.
5288980	5293620	And it made me, and I always said, I don't like, there's weed always makes me feel like I'm ugly
5293620	5297220	and stupid. And then you haven't paid your taxes so that you're going to have a heart attack.
5297220	5303540	And drinking always made me feel like I was beautiful and smart. I always felt very beautiful.
5303540	5305540	And made your penis beneficent. Yes.
5306980	5311300	Beatific. Beatific. I love the beatitudes of your balls.
5313380	5320260	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's a sweet lofty zone in there. And I think you're always kind of chasing
5320260	5326020	that spot. And it continues to shrink and become less and less reliable. And it's like, oh, this
5326020	5334820	euphoria, this medicinal equality. And as of late, what I've noticed is that it's becoming more and
5334820	5346420	more calculatively predictable that I'll use superfluous adverbs. Calculatively predictable.
5347780	5350980	Just say, oh, like a normal person if you don't know what you're going to say next.
5350980	5362500	Excuse me. But that my mood will just take a crash. It feels like something I can observe
5362500	5366740	because of therapy. Because my therapist, among the many things that I like about her,
5367700	5372260	she never forced that hand. I think she probably senses in me that this is like
5373220	5383140	a tough beast to get around and that she would just join many skulls on Golgotha if she were to
5383140	5390180	try to engage me about my drinking. And so she makes sure I know that she's not here to make me
5390180	5396100	quit. And that way, for that reason, because I can trust her, I've had more conversations about
5396100	5400180	drinking in my relationship with her than I've ever had in my life with a qualified professional
5400260	5406340	who knows all about it. And I forgot the rest of what I was going to say.
5407860	5413700	Spencer, you don't drink really, but didn't you also quit weed or are you just kind of ratchet
5413700	5425380	that back? I'm back, baby. No, I don't really buy weed or anything, but I spoke it with other
5425380	5430980	people or whatever. You don't have to. Tom Jones doesn't buy panties. And he's wearing them
5430980	5437940	everywhere. Were you ever weedy? Like Dave, were you ever like... I would only spoke weed when I
5437940	5442420	was blind drunk. Really? Yeah, because otherwise it would just make me really paranoid. Does it
5442420	5446660	bother you when we're on the road together because the rest of the cast of his life were always
5446660	5452420	drinking? No. That doesn't matter. No, no. I actually prefer... I don't like being around
5452420	5458260	sober people. They're horrible. Also, Dave on the road, he carries around a little speaker and
5458260	5463540	there's always jazz music wherever he goes. That's cool. He just carries around like after the show
5463540	5468100	where like taking pictures of people or signing stuff or whatever. And Dave just has this awesome
5469380	5474660	affinity of just like... It's not like you foisted on people. There's just always a beautiful
5474660	5479700	soundtrack happening. And then when you're not there, it's a bummer because we live in abject
5479700	5488180	silence. One of you could get a speaker. No, we're too drunk. Reggie Watts was at the Harmon Quest
5488180	5495460	premiere and he gave me a free sample of the beta test of his cartridge that he's developing.
5495460	5500580	Reggie Watts is trying to develop a weed cartridge. It's a great time for weed baits.
5500580	5504980	Just as they're about to be banned. Yeah, I guess that's... Did you read the New York Times thing
5504980	5512740	about the bust in Wisconsin, the two guys? No, they were doing like... Yeah, I didn't understand
5512740	5518260	this whole vaping thing. It was like this running gag happening because Cody was a fucking... What
5518260	5523140	are those things called? Vapor. Jewels. She was a jewel hound. She's Jeweling hard. And I'm so glad
5523140	5527540	she got scared off of it, whether it was valid or not, because I just hated that she was like
5527540	5533540	sucking down nicotine because I was a smoker until I was 32. And anyways, hey, get off my lawn. Good
5533540	5542820	night. But I guess what it is is that because pot's not legalized everywhere and then vape
5542820	5552100	cartridges, they kind of open the windows. It's like making gin in a bathtub. There's just a lot
5552100	5563380	of invitation for people to like homebrew weed juice, oil. And it's like you put anything in there
5563460	5568660	that you think gets the job done. And apparently something that some people are putting in is there.
5568660	5572740	Vitamin E oil they were using. Yeah. And that is what makes your lungs turn into...
5572740	5576980	It was linked, but who knows? Yeah. It seems that it was... Yeah, like Dan was saying,
5576980	5582900	it was just more tainted, specific tainted stuff that was gray market stuff. But vitamin E is used
5582900	5588900	in legal stuff. I don't know. But I mean, there's been no studies about how safe or unsafe vaping
5588900	5595140	is. I don't think we've ever done... We're in a really good one. I apply vitamin E oil to my lungs
5595140	5603860	topically. And that's been fine. But it's weird, they're banning flavored tobacco cartridges,
5603860	5610580	which I'm fairly certain they're not linked to any of the anythings. A single case I don't think
5610580	5617780	is linked to actual flavored tobacco. No, that's just linked to we don't want our children to
5617780	5625380	die of cancer. Sure. Does it give you cancer? No, the tobacco products that are like candy,
5625380	5630180	floss flavored, that they're not marketing to children, mind you. But does the vaping itself,
5630180	5636180	does that actually lead to cancer? No, I don't know. They don't really know. They say there's
5636180	5641540	some heavy metals. There are some heavy metals in vaping. Right. That's the thing. There's metal
5641540	5646580	pieces. And when you get heated up, some of the molecules fly off the surface of the metal. And
5646580	5657780	that's definitely great. I use the CBD vape pens because I'm old. Sure. And I don't want my bones
5657780	5663940	to hurt. Yeah. And I love those. Those are great for like arthritis. I did a little puff off of a
5663940	5675460	DMT pen. And you saw the dwarves that build time. I'm pretty sure I hung out with a palm tree for
5675460	5682180	about 15 minutes. Wait, are you serious? You did DMT? Out of a pen, like a vape pen. I thought DMT
5682180	5687700	was sort of a... You free basis. The idea of it coming in a pen is kind of like... I think it's
5687700	5692820	not as strong. I've never done DMT properly, but I did it out of a pen. And there was like a Joshua
5692820	5698900	tree and I was like, hey, buddy, I was grooved chickens for a while. And then it was over.
5698900	5703780	Jeff was grooved chickens. It only lasts like 15 minutes, right? Joe Rogan's a big DMT guy.
5703860	5712340	Who? Joe Rogan. He's like an expert on DMT and other psychedelics. I'm too old to try
5712340	5718660	transformative stuff. I maybe think maybe I would do ayahuasca before I'm 50. I'd like to do that.
5718660	5728900	Yeah. Let's do it on the final harm in town. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. Just be shitty. We get Jfully,
5728900	5735300	Spencer, Dan, me, Curtis Armstrong, and we fucking, and we just do ayahuasca. All right.
5735300	5738260	Because I like that ayahuasca at least is kind of transparent about it. They're like,
5738260	5741780	this is probably going to be awful. Yeah. You're going to puke in a bucket while you're
5743780	5750260	barf for a while. There's a lot of drugs that are poisonous, but ayahuasca is a poison that's
5750260	5758340	druginess. Has anybody here done ayahuasca proper? Sorry, two or three. Did you go out of
5758340	5767300	town or did you like Costa Rica or? That's not a guy. Because you wanted to be with the legit
5767300	5779780	shaman. I did it in Bushwick next to a guy. Were you at a house or like a party or what did you do?
5780260	5785060	I was hanging out with a friend and there was a shaman. They flew in.
5785060	5789860	Oh, you're kidding. You had a friend that could fly in a shaman into Brooklyn.
5789860	5796900	But that's the shittiest part of ayahuasca is the shaman. Bullshit spirituality.
5797860	5801140	No, but he's the guy that tells you where to barf and where not to barf and things like that,
5801140	5805780	right? Yeah. I want to do it, but I don't want to do this, like the touristy thing where you have
5805780	5810180	to go be in a waterfall at Machu Picchu or whatever the fuck. I'd rather go to Brooklyn.
5810820	5817140	I want to do it like however the people tell me to do it because I do not want to go off the
5817140	5820900	rails. It's probably illegal and stupid to say that we're going to do that. We're going to the
5820900	5825860	finale of harm and temper. We're all going to be in ayahuasca. It takes six hours. You take six
5825860	5834180	hours. Holy shit. The effect of drug in ayahuasca is DMT. Is it? Oh, really? Yeah. I did that in a
5834180	5843060	pool. That just comes in a pen. Yeah. You don't even have to get a shaman. Pocket shaman. Yeah. I
5843060	5853140	love you. My husband's boss is coming over for dinner. I haven't made the castle. Hello. I'm
5853140	5859220	pocket shaman. I can't trip. That'll be six hours. Yes, you can. Just one hit. I'm a pen.
5859700	5867140	Yeah. Whoa. Dwarves build time. I'm back. Now make that casserole. But aware of the
5867140	5870260	fact that casserole doesn't matter. Thank you, pocket shaman.
5877380	5880100	God, I wish it were 10 o'clock so we could end the show on that joke.
5880100	5882900	Chemical released by DMT may be the chemical released in your brain when you die.
5882900	5895060	Remember FDIC. I just did a little bit of it. I didn't get super duper high, but there was a
5895060	5900260	tree and we had a thing and it was kind of a romantic moment with a tree. I'm going up to
5900820	5909460	the storm area 51 thing. Oh, yeah. That's this Friday. Didn't Keanu Reeves say he was going to
5909460	5913620	fucking make it. Apparently he tweeted and said, like, I'll see you there.
5915940	5918740	I think we should do a test run on a normal military base first.
5920660	5923380	Just to make sure this is a good idea before we go to the one that.
5926740	5930980	I think we have like a fence outside of a fence and you have to get through that fence first.
5930980	5935620	They have sensors for like the miles and miles of desert surrounding them before you get to the
5935620	5939860	fence. You don't get to the fence. But it's not going to be 900,000 people. Let's say it
5939860	5946100	was seven. Yeah. 7,000. Well, the one I'm going to is just like they're calling it the base camp
5946100	5950740	and it's there. They're not near the base and they're not going to storm the base. So you got
5950740	5955860	to split up. You got to fucking you got to split up. You got to fucking you got to do it from all
5955860	5960660	sorts of different angles. Right. You know what? You should. Well, when you're you should go storm
5960660	5965300	base Borden when you're in Canada. Base Borden? Yeah, it's a military base. I'm going to do
5966180	5969780	what's the one that Fort Wayne was the one that's way up there. Yeah. Is that Fort Wayne? Fort Wayne.
5969780	5975140	I don't know. What's the one that's way up in the fucking Yukon? And I don't know. I'm Canadian.
5975140	5980180	I don't go North. Right. I can't believe you could still have an army after we kicked your ass in
5980180	5987220	1812. I believe we won. Oh, well, some of the telegrams still haven't made it down. Did
5988020	5992420	you guys burn down our White House? You know, the reason that happened,
5993060	5994980	yeah, that was an insurance scam.
5997940	6001380	We wanted to build a new one. Yeah. And you paid for it.
6004420	6011620	The war of 1812 was completely because, uh, uh, like the, the, we had hit the tipping point of like
6011620	6016260	how aggression moved just faster than communication. Like it was just sort of
6016260	6021060	like people would like write a letter going like, wait, no, we didn't know what they were going to
6021060	6026020	liberate Canada. The Americans were going to liberate Canada from the British and then they
6026020	6031780	came up and they went, these people don't want to be liberated. We're always so shocked about that.
6031780	6036180	Andrew Jackson was fighting the battle of, uh, New Orleans and all that shit. Like that, that war
6036180	6041380	was over and he was still kicking dick around there. And they're like, Hey, the boat has a letter
6041380	6047060	that says we it's over. Yeah. And yeah, it's a war that only Canadians care about. No Americans
6047140	6053060	care about the war of 1812. You know, it's amazing now is that Tim Hortons has, uh, they never had a
6053060	6058820	burger. Now they have a burger, but it's fucking beyond burger. So they, they now have only vegan
6058820	6062500	burgers though. They've never had a fucking burger before. Don't fucking, I heard that.
6063860	6069220	You can now get a fucking, Oh, and they have a veggie beyond sausage. You can get a fucking
6069220	6073940	sausage McMuffin. You can't get that in the States. She was appraising your segue, uh,
6073940	6079620	infrastructure. And I was like, you can't leap from whatever we were talking about to burgers.
6080260	6084020	The show's fucking over, Dan. I don't give a shit anymore.
6086020	6091540	I'm going to do ayahuasca, not on the show. And then I'm not even going to, I, this is my last
6091540	6098740	show. I quit. Okay. We got a Jeff off the chain. Uh, what are we going to do, Dan and Spencer,
6098740	6102100	after the harm in town has done, are we just going to fuck off another night or are we just
6102180	6106180	going to, I would like the two of you to continue to do, uh, commercials. Yeah.
6107380	6111700	I have to say, this is no, this is no disrespect, Dan. My favorite part of harm in town is going
6111700	6119620	and doing the ads. No sleep till Brooklyn. Oh yeah. That's a goodie. That was incredible.
6119620	6124740	We got to give it up for church and bra and Brendan who make all the ads fucking delicious.
6125380	6132020	Oh yeah. It's, it's church is good advice and Brendan's ability to make us sound like we know
6132020	6136900	what we're doing. It's fucking great. I love it. It's, it's, we go in there. We, we, we just
6136900	6141220	goof off for five minutes and we sell underwear. Do you think you'll still all be friends or,
6141220	6147140	or more to the point, have you guys become friends? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so.
6147140	6150420	Friendship with me though. It's kind of a mixed bag.
6150420	6153700	Get used to it.
6156980	6162740	But I got a pool now. Yeah, I got one of those. Yeah, I come over, but you're full of cameras.
6165300	6170260	I don't think I can see them in your pool. It's fucking creepy. Yeah, I pull them out. Also,
6170260	6177620	there's, they're small cameras, but they film loads of that. It's a callback to my, yeah. Yeah.
6177700	6182020	Yeah. Rolling. Like, like, is he trying to end the show? I'll help him. I'll help him.
6184020	6187620	So have you, have you got the underwater shit all rigged up? Like, so you can, you can do your
6187620	6192740	guys. I just have two, yeah, I have two underwater cameras that I, I made little rigs that I,
6192740	6198580	it takes about, you know, I get up in the morning. I put them in the, in the pool and yeah.
6201620	6206020	I think the drunkest I've been in the last year was at your pool. Cause we just like day drinking
6206020	6212100	in a pool in the heat of the Valley sun. Yeah. And then you just fucking wrecked. Yeah. And then
6212100	6218500	we went to Barone's and we had like red wine. Like, yeah, that was bad. Yeah, it can get nasty. Yeah.
6219860	6224180	I kind of miss it. Your house is, your house is very large. How much of the house have you
6224180	6228660	actually used? Because there's parts of that house that's never going to be occupied. I just
6228660	6233780	used the room to 32. I don't know. I tried to, I tried to, I tried to rip the, uh, what's the
6233860	6238820	shiny, your house is enormous. How many of your bathrooms haven't you pooped in?
6241380	6247620	I have not pooped into the guest bedroom bathroom. Uh, that's polite. Let's see.
6248980	6255380	What about that, that exterior one? Uh, I pooped in there while the decorators were there and
6255380	6260980	that's how I found out. I will never poop in there again. Cause the door to that one is like glass.
6260980	6266420	And yeah, you could see right in it. Yeah. It's like, I'm a standing wiper. I'll just say it.
6267140	6272820	Oh yeah. And before you fucking freak out, that's 40% of the public. So fuck off.
6272820	6276660	Is there, is there another way? How do you arrive at that number?
6276660	6282180	40% of the public by researching it after I found out that not everyone is a standing wiper
6282180	6288100	in like season three of community. You're not a stand, you're not a stand away portfolio.
6288100	6291780	How do you, how do you wipe while still sitting? I don't know. You lean forward.
6291780	6295620	You're a stand wiper. Yeah. You're a standard wiper. I got work to do. Yeah.
6298580	6304580	Thank you. Yeah. It's the work explaining why you stand up and wipe your butt.
6304580	6309540	Where you just get in there. I mean, it's already like the right angle on it.
6309540	6317620	Yeah. Like how am I supposed to stop wiping? Anyway, well, there's a roll of toilet paper.
6317620	6322180	There's a toilet that will clog if you fill it with the toilet paper. And there's an ass
6322180	6327540	that has plenty of shit for the role of toilet paper. So I'm like, yes, I'm standing.
6327540	6331780	Why does standing help that process? Because I'm, because like sitting and like
6331780	6336340	doing all this, that's just a confident person who's like, well, my ass has a certain amount
6336340	6340020	of poop in it and I'm going to just reach back and do these things. I don't know.
6340020	6344580	What kind of a princess sits there like this? Oh, yeah. Oh, that ought to do it.
6344580	6350180	Yes. I have to look at every wipe and be like, okay. So that's like, I compare it to a swatch
6350180	6358500	from Home Depot. I'm like, six more wipes to go. I'm only at like an acorn, like three flushes.
6359540	6362340	I'm going to make an executive comptroller decision right now.
6362340	6366660	Hermitown lasts another year until we get to the fucking bottom of this.
6366980	6374900	Whoa. The fans are loving it. Like you, you, you stand up and just now you don't stand up
6374900	6378260	and reach between your legs. Is that what you just mined? Wait, you stand up. Is it,
6378260	6384340	is it front to back or back to front? Front to back for fuck's sake. Yeah. Yeah. That's how
6384340	6390020	you avoid it. It's for us that stand. It's down to up because we're standing.
6390020	6399620	Yeah. No, you don't reach between your legs and pull shit towards your fucking vagina.
6399620	6402900	That's how you get the fact. Why not just sit and kind of gently
6402900	6406180	lean over to the side and do that? Because I, well, I, I'm going to,
6406180	6410420	I'm not going to pretend I made this Ben Franklin like decision. They're like,
6410420	6415140	Oh, a wise man always stands up. I obviously like, I don't think our mommies,
6416180	6418820	when you're a little kid, you wipe standing up pretty much.
6419620	6422580	Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't matter. Of course. Otherwise you fall in.
6424260	6427860	If your parents are like helping you wipe your ass, like in the beginning and then like,
6427860	6434740	I was never helped either. I never, I learned on the mean streets of Tustin, California.
6437380	6444660	Tustin. I just, I, I am assumed socialization. I mean, I really don't think it was like, I,
6444820	6449620	I truly made it to the age of like 37 before I found out that not everyone stands up when
6449620	6454500	they wipe their ass. And then in fact, a vast majority of people do not. I think it's, I think
6454500	6459220	it's weird. I don't know. I wouldn't know how to do it. I then tried to do it at once and I was
6459220	6464740	like, well, that's just out. That's a complete, I mean, it's like, this is a thing that you've
6464740	6468980	done every day. It's like switching to left-handed. I'm comfortable standing.
6468980	6471540	I'm comfortable with standing. It gets the job done. And like you said,
6471620	6473780	we got work to do. It's not like you're ever going to have to watch.
6476580	6478980	Cliffhanger! Oh boy.
6480100	6482900	Let's give it up. Dave Foley, everybody.
6485460	6489940	We're going to watch him take the food, Canadian style.
6492660	6493620	Spencer Crichton.
6496260	6500020	Let's give it up for Nolan Cherczak, everybody here at the Harman's Avenue.
6501540	6506340	Dr. Comptroller Jeff Davis, Spencer, your mayor, Dan Harman. Thank you so much.
6507860	6510580	There's only so many left. Let's make them count, shall we? Let's all
6511300	6513700	wipe our butts however we find ourselves happy.
6514500	6515700	Drive fast and take chances.
6522740	6523540	Zach, you got beat?
6531540	6541540	Yeah.
6541540	6542500	Did you get any of that?
6544100	6548340	It's a good show.
