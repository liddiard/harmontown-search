0	11040	This is real pro shit tonight, you guys.
11040	12040	I'm so fucking tired.
12040	14040	I just got off a plane and oh my god.
14040	15040	Alright, here we go.
15040	17040	It's gonna be a good one.
17040	18040	Because I just don't care.
18040	19040	Here we go!
19040	30080	I wanna see your face, everywhere I go.
30080	31080	Hello, one and all.
31080	36080	Welcome once again to Nerdonaut Theater, Melton Island Comics in Hollywood, California.
36080	43080	Hermitown is now in session.
43120	44120	Fifth Bank Pow.
44120	49120	Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Hermitown, Jen Hermit.
54120	56120	Yep, yep, yep.
56120	57120	Thank you.
57120	59120	Why, why, why, I always ask this.
59120	61120	Why, why so many of you?
61120	63120	What's, what's the deal?
63120	66120	Game of Thrones is over.
66120	68120	Isn't there one more?
68120	69120	That was it last time?
69120	70120	Yeah, you know.
70120	71120	Oh, I was out of town.
71120	72120	No, wait, was I?
72160	73160	I don't fucking know, man.
73160	75160	Yeah, get caught up, man.
75160	76160	Yeah.
76160	77160	Really?
77160	80160	Alright, so movie update.
80160	84160	Uh, let's talk about Edge of Tomorrow in a second.
84160	91160	Uh, I went and saw Edge of Tomorrow tonight and uh, but there was a trailer.
91160	96160	I've never been more excited about a movie that didn't involve people blowing up.
96200	106200	Robert Downey Jr. is gonna play Robert Duvall's son in a movie about a lawyer that goes back home and Robert Duvall is, you can see this trailer?
106200	107200	No.
107200	115200	Every trailer I saw, uh, for the last two movies I saw, which are Godzilla and Edge of Tomorrow, every trailer was about robots and shit blowing up.
115200	122200	Which is my, yeah, that's what you need to get a rise out of me, but I was like, Robert Downey Jr. is like, ah, he's an asshole and I'm an asshole.
122240	123240	I get people off.
123240	124240	I'm a lawyer.
124240	126240	And then it's like, ah, your mom passed away or whatever.
126240	128240	And then he goes back home and it's Robert Duvall's dad.
128240	130240	His dad's a judge.
130240	132240	I'm fucking in, man.
132240	134240	It's crazy.
134240	136240	I hope that's not a shitty movie.
136240	141240	Whoever wrote that movie, if you got those actors to be in your movie, Robert Downey Jr. playing Robert Duvall's son.
141240	143240	Robert Duvall is my favorite living actor.
143240	144240	Oh, it's gonna be good.
144240	146240	I'm signing up for that.
146240	150240	But I was there for Edge of Tomorrow, which is fucking awesome.
150280	152280	Go see it.
152280	154280	Last half hour is like whatever.
154280	159280	Apparently we can't fully commit to a time bending, like, action movie.
159280	162280	Apparently for the last half hour, you definitely just have to go.
162280	164280	Okay, now cut the red wire, the blue wire.
164280	166280	I'm not spoiling it.
166280	167280	There's no bomb in it.
167280	169280	I'm just saying.
169280	171280	But it's pretty profound, that movie.
171280	173280	We were just talking about The Green Room.
173280	178280	I'm very accurate for everyone to say it's Groundhog Day, sci-fi.
178320	184320	But the thing that you don't know when you hear that is that I think it's like a sequel to Groundhog Day.
185320	187320	Like, it picks up.
187320	191320	It's the James Cameron, like Ridley Scott made Groundhog Day.
191320	193320	And then this is the James Cameron.
193320	196320	This is Groundhog's days.
196320	201320	And that doesn't mean more Groundhogs and more days.
201320	204320	It means something more important than that.
204360	209360	It means something more profound about our relationship with time and mortality and stuff.
209360	212360	It's actually really, really fucking cool.
212360	218360	Also, I was very happy, as I said backstage, it reminded me that I've always liked Tom Cruise.
218360	224360	He's a fucking great movie star and he went nuts and he believes in weird boogie boogie boogies.
224360	227360	But he's fucking badass in that movie.
227360	229360	I like Tom Cruise again.
229360	230360	Wow.
230400	233400	All right, we like Tom Cruise again.
233400	236400	Tom Cruise, if you're listening...
236400	242400	I would say he almost certainly listens to this.
242400	246400	This is a record, like, I don't know, I've come up here with nothing on my notepad.
246400	251400	But that's really, that's, as far as me having something on my notepad, I had...
251400	255400	Oh, no, no, it says R.S.J. as Robert Duvall's son.
255400	258400	I'm assuming that means R.D.
260360	263360	They're adjacent on the keyboard.
263360	265360	I'm really excited about that.
265360	268360	I think that's going to be a new on Golden Pond.
268360	271360	Father and son shit drives me crazy. I fucking love it.
271360	273360	The idea of Robert Duvall being...
273360	277360	He's a judge, but Robert Duvall, Robert Downey Jr. is a lawyer. Fuck you.
277360	278360	There's no bad...
278360	282360	I'm gonna die. I can't wait to see this movie.
282360	284360	There's no bad Robert Duvall movie for my money, is there?
284360	286360	No bad Robert Downey Jr.
286360	288360	He was in true grit, for fuck's sake, man, either.
289360	291360	Rooster? Shut the pieces up here, Rooster.
291360	293360	There's only so many mainstream things I approve of.
293360	296360	Oxygen, alcohol...
296360	298360	And R.S.J.
299360	301360	And Iron Man.
302360	306360	I wanted to talk a little bit about linguistics. Do you mind?
306360	309360	Fuck no. I insist.
311360	313360	I feel like...
314360	316360	We gotta bring Spencer up for this conversation,
316360	319360	because I want to catch him off guard and I want to talk about something.
319360	322360	Can we just have Spencer come out early and just have him here?
322360	325360	I think he should come out before us.
329360	331360	Spencer Crichton.
336360	337360	You cool sitting there?
337360	340360	I got caught in a nail. Yeah.
341360	342360	Was it sharp? Did it cut you?
342360	345360	No, it's a head. Pull that nail out. That's really dangerous.
345360	347360	A head will fuck you up.
349360	351360	Now I'm your king.
352360	354360	You set that to the nail?
355360	359360	No, he's doing Excalibur. He's the king of a really tiny king number.
359360	361360	Well, is he talking to us or is he talking to the nail?
361360	363360	I think he's saying to all of us, because...
363360	364360	He's our king.
364360	366360	It's a sword in the stone kind of mythology going on.
366360	369360	Anyone who believes it, I'll take it.
369360	371360	Let's not rule anybody out.
371360	373360	Unite us, motherfucker.
373360	376360	Did you really want to talk about linguistics?
376360	377360	Yeah.
377360	378360	Shoot.
381360	385360	All right, so I've never talked to you about this, ever.
385360	386360	Uh-oh.
386360	387360	This is a thing I've noticed.
387360	388360	Shit.
390360	394360	It hasn't spread to Jeff, and I don't know who started it.
394360	398360	I don't know who patient zero of this linguistic thing is.
398360	399360	Uh-huh.
399360	402360	For all I know it started with me, spread to you.
402360	405360	For all I know it started with you, spread to me.
405360	410360	It might have started with Aaron, but I've noticed it with me, you, and Aaron.
410360	411360	Uh-huh.
412360	416360	Starting sentences with, I mean...
416360	417360	I mean...
418360	420360	Who started it? Who started that?
420360	422360	That feels like a Spencer-ism to me.
422360	425360	Well, see, he owns it better than us, but...
425360	427360	I mean, yes, I don't do that.
429360	431360	That was ill-fitting shoes.
432360	438360	Okay, so do you guys remember episode one of, blah, blah, blah, the sleepy canyoneer?
438360	439360	Yeah.
439360	446360	Colin, the sleepy canyoneer, is someone from which I derive a lot of my vocal regularizations.
446360	447360	And...
447360	449360	Regularizations.
449360	452360	Yeah, such as regularizations.
456360	457360	That happens.
457360	458360	Yeah.
458360	462360	But yeah, no, I think that he does that in...
462360	465360	I don't think I did it too much, but I think that I did it more.
465360	466360	I think you do it too.
466360	468360	I do it a ton, that's what I'm saying.
468360	469360	Yeah, I think that I...
469360	472360	You, me, and Aaron, that's all I know.
472360	478360	Maybe, I can picture Spencer saying it, I can also definitely say that Aaron says it a lot.
478360	483360	And for all I know, Aaron started it, I got it from her, spread it to Spencer.
483360	486360	But for all I know, also, other way around, I have no idea.
487360	489360	I feel like it's more of an Aaron-ism, actually.
489360	493360	I think that predates my memory of her saying that.
493360	494360	Do you think it's possible, Spencer?
494360	497360	I mean, you brought up canyoneer, are you saying that you got it from him?
497360	498360	You know that?
498360	500360	I mean, I wouldn't be surprised.
500360	503360	I also wouldn't be surprised if I got it from Aaron.
503360	507360	I mean, you know, she says it to everybody.
508360	510360	For me, I would put the money on Aaron.
510360	512360	It sounds like an Aaron thing.
512360	513360	I mean, but it's not...
513360	518360	The interesting thing about language is, like, everybody has these bookends and things.
518360	519360	People say...
519360	523360	So, Aaron and I were talking about this, and we were talking about the prefix, I mean,
523360	530360	and then the suffix, though, as in, I mean this, though?
530360	534360	Like, that's actually a full, like, emotional thing.
534360	539360	Like, you could point at a fire hydrant and go, I mean this, though?
539360	543360	But the interesting thing is, there's nothing in that sentence that actually syntactically
543360	545360	conveys any information.
545360	549360	But everything that you're saying, the way you're saying it, I mean this, though?
549360	552360	The though takes away the meaning in it.
552360	556360	Like, you've just subtracted the I mean from it by saying, though.
556360	558360	Haven't you kind of...
558360	559360	I'm not sure.
559360	562360	I'm not committing to this, am I?
562360	564360	I'm not sure about that.
564360	567360	I don't know if my brain's moving fast enough to know if I agree with that.
567360	571360	I think what's interesting is that I mean is, like, one of many things where you go,
571360	572360	look, listen, hey.
572360	573360	Here's the deal.
573360	574360	At the end of the day, hey.
574360	576360	I hate it at the end of the day.
576360	581360	Some of the stuff we hate because we notice it, but we all...
581360	585360	If there's anybody here who doesn't use those things, great on them.
585360	593360	But I think that also the interesting thing is that I say I mean a lot, and I actually,
593360	597360	like, I'm looking back at the last six months or a year of going, I mean...
597360	602360	And actually, like, I kind of feel the way about it, like I do about Instagram.
602360	610360	Like, I feel like actually it's bringing me closer to people.
610360	619360	I feel like if I didn't have that canopy over my sidewalk, cafe, that the sun would be harsher.
619360	622360	I mean, because that doesn't hurt anybody.
622360	623360	Yeah, I mean...
623360	626360	But my dad says, my dad has a tick.
626360	629360	I think all that is is just a time stalling the tick.
629360	630360	Lots of people have that.
630360	633360	I think it's more than that.
633360	634360	I think it's more than time stalling.
634360	636360	Um, um is a time stall.
636360	637360	Yeah, but...
637360	638360	The way you fill that time.
638360	639360	If you don't mean it, then don't say it.
639360	640360	Like, I mean, so you're saying it.
640360	643360	You mean everything you say, whether you mean it or not.
643360	651360	And I think saying I mean is like, it's a non...
651360	652360	It's a non...
652360	653360	It's not an adjective.
653360	654360	Well, you're in this space.
654360	659360	Like, you're saying, you're implying that, like, I just said like.
659360	661360	Like, I shouldn't have said like.
661360	664360	I say like, like, like, like, like, like, too.
664360	665360	I stutter like all the time.
665360	667360	I definitely think the same way.
667360	669360	It's like, it's good for all of us to do sit-ups.
669360	671360	What could it hurt?
672360	677360	Um, the I mean, which is like, like grabbing your belly and like going, this is me.
677360	681360	This is like, it's like we're dripping into each other.
681360	682360	The way that we talk to each other.
682360	685360	I mean, you know what I mean, though.
685360	689360	It's like, it's a short version of verily I say unto the...
690360	692360	That's very interesting to me.
692360	696360	I remember reading something that, it's like, what does that mean?
696360	697360	I remember reading something.
697360	698360	That's another one.
698360	699360	What the fuck does that mean?
699360	705360	All that means is that I, I'm just reminding you that I, the last, since the last time
705360	708360	you saw me, I haven't been just standing here like C-3PO shut down.
708360	709360	I went off.
709360	713360	I read maybe a Newsweek article that someone tweeted me.
713360	714360	Maybe.
714360	719360	And we don't know if that guy's information was researched, but I remember reading somewhere
719360	721360	about communication.
721360	726360	It's so incredibly tiny.
726360	729360	The fraction of what we say to each other is syntactical.
729360	733360	The actual words that we say, they mean so little.
733360	734360	Obviously it's vital.
734360	741360	There's absolutely no way to communicate with each other without, there's this bed of the
741360	742360	words we say.
742360	747360	But the words we say, there's a way I could say the word fire hydrant to you that would
747360	753360	make you understand that I don't like you, that I've had it with you.
753360	755360	I want to know what that is.
755360	757360	I don't, I don't like the way you said fire hydrant.
757360	759360	You know, like, and then it'd be like, what, what?
759360	760360	I just said fire hydrant.
760360	761360	And it's like, come on.
761360	766360	Like we, when we enter into relationships with each other, we drip into each other.
766360	767360	We're still amoeba.
767360	771360	We're still just multicellular organisms and we, we vibrate air around us.
771360	774360	But that is so, it's so interesting to me.
774360	779360	Like we have these little canopies and flaps and spoilers on everything that we do.
779360	782360	Well, the English language is very different than other languages too.
782360	786360	Like there's like, we have a lot of words for one thing and then like Italians say,
786360	788360	there's one word that means tons of things.
788360	794360	Like I was reading this book today and I actually was reading a book today.
794360	800360	And it was, this is a woman writing a letter to a German and like in World War II, I'm
800360	804360	still reading those World War II detective novels, which are the best by Philip Kerr.
804360	808360	And she says, I hope this letter's making sense.
808360	811360	My German's not that great.
811360	820360	Emperor Charles V said, I speak, I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to
820360	824360	men and German to my horse.
824360	827360	But you are the horse to fucking run.
827360	829360	That's a really interesting thing.
829360	834360	The idea that language is never meant to be, you know, one channel or another.
834360	839360	Like, but you, yeah, I mean, that's your, that was your takeaway.
839360	840360	Huh?
840360	843360	That was, I think her point was that she's making fun of him for being German.
843360	845360	They're very straight and they're very direct.
845360	848360	And she's saying like, I'm from America.
848360	855360	They'd hate you over here because you're so cynical and so direct and like things have
855360	856360	one meaning.
856360	862360	Like in American English, things have all sorts of intonations and subtexts and things
862360	863360	like that.
863360	867360	I just thought it meant that like horses, like German's so shitty that horses speak
867360	868360	it.
869360	876360	If I was a horse, if I were a horse, to use a subjunctive, if I were a horse and someone
876360	880360	tried to try to get me to run an Italian, I'd be like, I'm going to fucking take a nap.
880360	881360	Hey, a little horse.
881360	883360	You might feel like a gallop and I don't know.
883360	884360	What do you want to do?
884360	885360	What do you want to do?
885360	891360	You will stay and then come and you should get my new house.
891360	893360	That sounds like get the fuck going.
893360	897360	I'm just spreading white on white racism right now.
899360	903360	Speaking of which, let's do a World Cup sports corner.
914360	916360	Dan, the World Cup.
916360	919360	Boy, what a World Cup.
919360	924360	I'll start this by saying, Dan, that I was on the road this last weekend with the Who's
924360	926360	Line boys and we had these big tour bus rides.
926360	929360	We watched every minute of the World Cup so far.
929360	932360	That cup was extra worldly.
932360	938360	Today, Dan, I'm sure like all Americans, you have strong feelings about USA Portugal.
938360	941360	I know that the United States was involved in the World Cup today.
941360	943360	Everyone knows it.
943360	948360	That's part of what makes it extra more important than the already totally important World Cup.
949360	954360	Is that America was part of the World Cup today.
954360	956360	I know, I know.
957360	959360	Do you think they're going to make it out of the group stage?
959360	960360	They're not done?
961360	962360	No.
962360	963360	No.
963360	965360	I think that America today...
965360	966360	Does anybody here...
966360	968360	And I don't imagine the answer will be yes.
968360	971360	Does anybody here afraid of hearing soccer spoilers today?
971360	973360	Soccer spoilers.
974360	979360	I was running scared because I was on a plane during two of the matches and I had to make
979360	983360	it home and hope that some guy didn't go like, we did it or...
983360	984360	Right.
984360	985360	You don't want to...
985360	989360	You come off the plane and there's a guy, instead of holding a sign that says Davis,
989360	992360	it says, they didn't use their hands.
993360	995360	And you're like, oh shit, fuck.
996360	1005360	Yeah, so today was a big day in World Cup football, what they call football history.
1005360	1006360	I think that...
1006360	1007360	How many more games to go?
1007360	1008360	Two?
1008360	1009360	Three?
1009360	1010360	Five?
1010360	1011360	They're in the group stage.
1011360	1012360	They have to play Germany.
1012360	1013360	A draw gets them through.
1013360	1014360	This is a big deal.
1014360	1016360	So the US won, of course.
1016360	1017360	No.
1018360	1019360	It was a draw today.
1019360	1020360	They were winning.
1020360	1021360	They were beating Portugal.
1021360	1022360	They've never beaten...
1022360	1026360	It was gonna be the best victory of all time and they lost it in the last kick of the game.
1026360	1029360	It was a draw in the last kick of the game.
1029360	1030360	And they could have...
1030360	1033360	If they'd won it, they would have been advanced to the knockout stage.
1033360	1034360	But why am I telling you this, Dan?
1034360	1035360	You're the sports...
1035360	1036360	Yeah.
1038360	1039360	So they did good...
1039360	1041360	Yeah, they did very, very well.
1043360	1045360	Shit on the bit a little bit.
1047360	1049360	I guess they did okay.
1050360	1051360	What do you think the...
1051360	1052360	Who do you like?
1052360	1054360	Which country do you think has the best chance together?
1054360	1055360	USA.
1055360	1057360	I mean, I think the USA is gonna go all the way.
1058360	1060360	You thought they were already out of it.
1060360	1061360	No.
1061360	1062360	I think that they're in the cup.
1062360	1067360	In the World Cup, what people need to understand, it doesn't work like American football.
1070360	1076360	In the World Cup, it's possible to be in the cup with other teams.
1077360	1079360	It's not about brackets and...
1080360	1082360	This team beat the other team.
1082360	1085360	It's like, we're all in the cup together.
1086360	1088360	Eventually, it does come down.
1088360	1089360	I'm not being naive.
1089360	1091360	Eventually, it does come down to two teams.
1091360	1093360	But it's very worldly.
1094360	1096360	And they go down, and they're in the cup.
1096360	1100360	And the US is in that cup, which I think is amazing.
1100360	1103360	It's a World Cup, and it's about time the US was in it.
1103360	1104360	That's fucking great.
1104360	1106360	Nobody use your hands!
1107360	1109360	Stop using your hands!
1109360	1112360	What do you think about the home nation's job so far of hosting this?
1112360	1114360	Well, I mean, the US is doing...
1114360	1116360	I mean, they're doing what they can.
1119360	1121360	I don't mean that they're the home nation.
1121360	1122360	Right.
1122360	1123360	From that reaction.
1125360	1130360	I mean that the US is handling themselves very graciously as a guest of the home nation.
1131360	1136360	Going up that red carpet and competing in that soccer stadium.
1136360	1139360	And when I say soccer, I use it colloquially.
1139360	1140360	I know it's called football.
1140360	1142360	And spelled wrong.
1144360	1146360	I think that it's great.
1146360	1147360	I think it's a great...
1147360	1149360	The home nation that you're talking about.
1149360	1150360	Brazil.
1150360	1151360	Yeah.
1151360	1152360	They're doing great.
1152360	1158360	Gone, long gone are the days of accusing them of harboring Hitler.
1161360	1171360	Let's put aside these stereotypes of child porn and Orwellian futures.
1171360	1175360	Now, Dan, Dan, normally we think of the...
1175360	1179360	I don't think everyone in Brazil has to work on a typewriter.
1180360	1182360	Fuck you, Terry Gilliam.
1182360	1184360	The important thing is soccer.
1185360	1188360	We think of the big European superpowers.
1188360	1190360	And a couple have already been shamefully knocked out.
1190360	1194360	Who do you like to do with the European, you know, old granddaddy superpowers?
1194360	1196360	Well, I mean, you gotta go England.
1196360	1197360	I mean, it's great.
1198360	1199360	They're great at football.
1199360	1200360	You think they still have a chance?
1204360	1206360	I know that's a trick question.
1209360	1210360	Because I can tell.
1212360	1213360	So, fuck you.
1213360	1214360	I mean, it's a...
1215360	1217360	They invented the sport, you know.
1217360	1219360	Yeah, but, like, guess what?
1219360	1220360	Jeff, they're out.
1220360	1221360	They are?
1224360	1226360	You're like a really shitty mentalist.
1229360	1232360	I could think of myself as a big fan of soccer.
1234360	1238360	Yeah, so England's out, and it's crazy that USA's still in.
1238360	1241360	They're still in that big cup with the world.
1242360	1244360	I think Argentina...
1245360	1250360	It's probably going to not be able to be underestimated.
1253360	1255360	I don't think you ever should underestimate Argentina.
1255360	1257360	I think you got that exactly right.
1257360	1258360	You got a lot of guys out there.
1258360	1261360	They got the calves and their muscles and the muscles and the calves.
1261360	1262360	They're kicking the ball.
1262360	1264360	They're not going to use their hands.
1264360	1270360	In Argentina, if you use your hand to say hello, you get thrown in jail.
1270360	1273360	This is a soccer nation, Argentina.
1273360	1276360	They're continual World Cup champions.
1276360	1277360	Am I right?
1277360	1279360	Argentina's casually winning the World Cup, right?
1279360	1280360	Not since a long time.
1280360	1284360	Historically, go back, go back all the way to the beginning.
1285360	1289360	Historically, Argentina has won a World Cup, never.
1289360	1291360	1970s, I think, we go back.
1291360	1292360	See? You got to go back.
1292360	1297360	You got to be a true soccer enthusiast to really appreciate Argentinian soccer.
1297360	1300360	Now, Dan, one thing I find, and I think you'll agree or disagree,
1300360	1303360	because you have your very strong opinions about this.
1303360	1305360	I look at soccer in a really specific way.
1305360	1310360	The fact that this is a South American country hosting this,
1310360	1313360	the South and Central American teams are doing quite well.
1313360	1314360	They're really leaping forward.
1314360	1318360	There's certain teams that had to have surprised you from South and Central America.
1320360	1324360	Aside from Argentina, which we shouldn't ever not possibly underestimate.
1325360	1326360	No, there aren't.
1326360	1327360	Yeah, you're right.
1327360	1329360	I think if I'm hearing you correctly what you're saying is this.
1329360	1332360	Name any country in Central or South America.
1337360	1340360	That might have a football team in the World Cup.
1341360	1346360	Look, I hope I don't disappoint you by approaching this question from the outskirts.
1347360	1350360	You have to look at the big picture of soccer, the history of soccer, okay?
1350360	1351360	Okay.
1351360	1353360	In the beginning, okay?
1353360	1358360	This is a game that was traditionally dominated by South America and Central America.
1359360	1361360	You had the Panamanians.
1364360	1365360	What do they know?
1366360	1367360	They know canals.
1367360	1370360	They're not good at soccer.
1371360	1372360	Ecuador.
1373360	1375360	They're good, but not good enough.
1382360	1386360	I think they were in the cup briefly this time, so we're getting warmer here.
1386360	1387360	Yeah, that's what I said.
1387360	1388360	That's what I just said.
1388360	1389360	All right.
1390360	1392360	It irks me when he...
1392360	1400360	I'm trying to give my World Cup report, and he comes in and it's like, I said that.
1401360	1403360	The Aztecs...
1407360	1409360	I'm not saying they still have a country at...
1409360	1412360	You mean the old LA indoor soccer club from the 1980s?
1413360	1418360	Look, at the end of the day, you have a country like...
1418360	1420360	At the end of a day? God damn it.
1421360	1422360	North America.
1422360	1424360	North America is what it is.
1424360	1426360	At the end of the day, it is what it is.
1426360	1430360	South of that, you have Central America, which a lot of people don't understand.
1430360	1433360	South of Central America, you have South America.
1433360	1434360	Right.
1434360	1435360	Am I wrong?
1435360	1436360	This is good soccer information.
1436360	1440360	So, I think Chile is going to win the World Cup this year.
1443360	1445360	They're doing really well.
1445360	1446360	They really are.
1446360	1449360	Them and Costa Rica are looking fucking awesome right now.
1449360	1450360	All right. Fuck you.
1452360	1453360	World Cup.
1454360	1456360	Chile. My buddies are in Chile.
1458360	1460360	I didn't even know that was South America.
1461360	1464360	40% chance it was Africa.
1465360	1466360	My...
1468360	1469360	Oh, boy.
1469360	1471360	My knowledge of the globe is like...
1471360	1474360	My dog barks at my gardener, and then I'm like,
1474360	1475360	eh, I don't know what.
1476360	1477360	They're going to work.
1478360	1481360	All right. That's it. That's all I got to talk about.
1481360	1482360	That was a quick show?
1482360	1483360	Yeah. Good night, everybody.
1484360	1485360	Spencer.
1485360	1486360	Hey, guys.
1486360	1490360	Hey, you know, recently we had the Harman Town movie screening.
1490360	1491360	Do you remember that?
1491360	1492360	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1493360	1496360	Did any of you guys go to the L.A. movie?
1498360	1499360	Yeah.
1499360	1501360	I mean, I wasn't trying to, you know,
1501360	1504360	encourage one of those pity applause or whatever.
1504360	1505360	All right.
1505360	1506360	Has anything...
1507360	1509360	That time I was. Good job.
1510360	1513360	Nothing's changed for you since that movie premiered in L.A., right?
1513360	1514360	No.
1514360	1515360	You still...
1515360	1518360	Okay. So, remember in the Q&A, the guy...
1518360	1520360	There was this host guy.
1520360	1522360	He was like the LACMA dude, whatever.
1522360	1524360	He brought us all up, and then he was like,
1524360	1529360	you know, someone told me a story about how you and Neil first met.
1529360	1530360	Yeah.
1530360	1532360	It was in a pizza joint.
1532360	1533360	Yeah.
1533360	1534360	And...
1534360	1535360	And it wasn't.
1535360	1538360	Yeah. And you told him that, like right off the bat.
1538360	1540360	You're like, yeah, that was wrong.
1540360	1541360	And then, like, he got mad.
1541360	1542360	He got mad?
1542360	1543360	Do you remember that?
1543360	1544360	I know.
1544360	1547360	Maybe he was just flustered, but, like, he got really, like, weird about it.
1547360	1549360	He was like, well, that's just what I heard.
1549360	1550360	Like...
1550360	1552360	Yeah, okay. I remember that. I remember that.
1552360	1553360	It was weird, but...
1553360	1554360	He's mad at his assistants briefly.
1554360	1555360	Yeah, he's mad at it.
1555360	1559360	Yeah, but I was thinking it would be weird if he just got really indignant about it.
1559360	1561360	It was like, no! It was pizza!
1561360	1563360	You have pepperoni!
1563360	1565360	There's three slices left over.
1565360	1566360	Everybody knows it was pizza.
1566360	1567360	Yeah.
1567360	1569360	What are you doing to me right now?
1569360	1571360	But, yeah, I don't know.
1571360	1572360	That was a good time.
1574360	1578360	Do you remember at the L.A. Film Festival when all the cast came out,
1578360	1580360	and then you got more applause than me?
1580360	1581360	Yeah, yeah.
1581360	1584360	I was hoping I wouldn't have to bring that up.
1584360	1586360	I'll bring it up. I'll bring it up.
1586360	1590360	They brought us all out, the whole cast of the movie, cast.
1590360	1591360	It's a documentary.
1591360	1592360	He was there.
1592360	1594360	So it's not like we're playing characters, like, so I could go,
1594360	1596360	oh, Spencer did do a good job on that character.
1596360	1598360	As himself.
1598360	1601360	Who am I playing chopped liver?
1601360	1602360	Like, I...
1602360	1604360	It was like...
1604360	1605360	It was...
1605360	1606360	They were like,
1606360	1609360	Spencer Crittenden and the fucking crowd, like, they rose to their feet.
1609360	1612360	Yeah, but if the cast of Star Wars, the characters came out,
1612360	1614360	they would clap louder for Han Solo than Darth Vader.
1616360	1617360	Well, I'm not...
1618360	1620360	I actually think...
1621360	1624360	I actually think they would clap, like, pretty loud for Darth Vader,
1624360	1631360	but that's what actually hurts is I felt like I was, like, one of the Jawas.
1633360	1635360	And they kind of staggered it.
1635360	1637360	They were like, Spencer, and everyone was like, whoo!
1637360	1641360	And then it was like, and of course, the titular character, Dan Harmon.
1641360	1644360	And everyone was like, he's fine, too. It's fine.
1646360	1648360	Maybe they were all clapped out from Spencer.
1648360	1650360	They were! Yes, they were!
1650360	1652360	Yes, their hands were bleeding.
1653360	1654360	And I don't...
1654360	1657360	Have you ever been torn between...
1657360	1661360	It's funny, because I'm 41, I should have a son Spencer's age.
1662360	1666360	If everything had gone correctly, according to the Midwestern tradition,
1666360	1668360	I would have you as a son.
1668360	1669360	Nice.
1671360	1672360	And...
1672360	1674360	There's still wills to write, I mean.
1679360	1682360	Sorry, I kind of, yeah, I imagine that's going to be like,
1682360	1688360	like to have a kid, like, oh, God, get that soccer goal.
1688360	1692360	Win that potato science fair thing.
1692360	1695360	And then there must be some other part of you that's like,
1695360	1697360	fuck, he did it. He did it.
1698360	1701360	And then you just go in the attic and just Hunter Thompson.
1703360	1705360	Because you're like, what else do I do?
1705360	1706360	Write a bunch of wonderful books?
1706360	1707360	Yeah, yeah.
1710360	1712360	I'm sorry I made it dark. I didn't mean to...
1713360	1714360	I didn't mean it.
1714360	1717360	If you guys ever think I would actually kill myself, you're insane.
1718360	1722360	I'm so much more petty than that. I would never...
1722360	1725360	If anybody's worried about that ever happening.
1725360	1728360	What if you were in, like, pain like Hunter S. Thompson?
1728360	1730360	If I'm in pain, yeah, if I get a cold, fuck it.
1733360	1736360	I will go to one doctor, one doctor.
1736360	1737360	Can you knock this out?
1737360	1741360	And if he's like, give it six weeks, I'm like, give me five weeks, bang.
1741360	1743360	Waiting period.
1744360	1747360	My leg hurts? Yeah, fuck it.
1747360	1750360	All right, so let's move on. This is depressing.
1752360	1755360	I'm going to pull out... I don't think there's anything in here.
1755360	1758360	I'm really excited about Robert Duvall playing...
1759360	1763360	Robert Downey Jr.'s dad, World Cup.
1763360	1764360	I'm going to be honest with you.
1764360	1766360	That was just part of that whole linguistic thing.
1766360	1768360	Like, some people say, Erin was saying that,
1768360	1769360	I was talking about that with her.
1769360	1771360	She's like, people say, honestly?
1771360	1774360	Or they go like, I'm going to be honest with you.
1774360	1776360	And there's nothing wrong with that.
1776360	1778360	It's beyond the whole idea of like, oh, I hate that.
1778360	1779360	We should never do that and stuff.
1779360	1781360	It's just something that we do.
1781360	1782360	Sometimes we do it.
1782360	1784360	There's people out here who have abused that.
1784360	1787360	There's people who... I have used the phrase,
1787360	1791360	I'm going to be honest with you, to wonderful effect.
1793360	1794360	I'll give you an example.
1794360	1795360	Give me an example.
1795360	1797360	No, there's no example.
1797360	1800360	I'm just saying like, it's not about being a good or bad person.
1800360	1803360	Somebody tweeted me a link, Jeff.
1803360	1805360	Somebody tweeted me a link.
1806360	1809360	What was that link?
1810360	1812360	To this guy that does this thing.
1812360	1814360	It's called, what the hell is it called?
1814360	1816360	Surveillance Cameraman?
1816360	1818360	Does anybody know what I'm talking about?
1818360	1821360	This is a man who deals with surveillance cameras.
1821360	1823360	It's a guy who takes a camera.
1823360	1824360	A kid, maybe I should call him.
1824360	1825360	I don't know what to call him.
1825360	1828360	Takes a camera and he just...
1828360	1832360	Now dismiss all your notions of like, good person, bad person.
1832360	1834360	Just assume he's a bad person.
1834360	1835360	Sounds like he is.
1835360	1839360	He just takes a camera and he just goes up and gets in people's faces.
1839360	1841360	He just stands there with the camera.
1841360	1842360	That's what he does.
1842360	1844360	People can see the camera as a hidden camera.
1844360	1845360	Yeah, no, they can see it.
1845360	1847360	So it's just...
1847360	1853360	It's a montage of people looking and going, what are you doing?
1854360	1855360	Stop it.
1855360	1859360	And then it splinters off into all of this behavior.
1859360	1861360	None of which is good or bad.
1861360	1862360	All of which is fascinating.
1862360	1865360	Is he provoking them with questions or things?
1865360	1866360	No.
1866360	1867360	He turns the...
1867360	1868360	This kid has...
1868360	1871360	I mean, I think this kid is just going through a phase that we all went through,
1871360	1875360	but he has access to more technology than we had over this kid's age.
1875360	1877360	That's my assumption, but don't...
1877360	1878360	I don't know.
1878360	1881360	He could be 48 years old.
1881360	1885360	What matters is that this kid has effectively...
1885360	1887360	Regardless of what he's doing,
1887360	1892360	the end result of what you're watching is that you're getting to see humanity
1892360	1898360	as if you're a scuba diver outside a coral reef.
1898360	1901360	And so there's fish that gather around you
1901360	1904360	and are angry at you because they're gathered around you.
1904360	1906360	There's fish that, of course, dart the other way.
1906360	1910360	There's fish that come at you or that circle you for a second
1910360	1913360	and then dart at you and try to get your mask off.
1913360	1915360	There's fish that...
1915360	1917360	And everything in between.
1917360	1921360	This guy will open the back door of a Burger King
1921360	1924360	and walk into the kitchen.
1924360	1930360	And it's just a POV of walking through a fucking Burger King
1930360	1935360	back in the kitchen with eight people cutting lettuce, flipping burgers.
1935360	1939360	And every person he walks by, it's like they're all brontosauruses in Jurassic Park.
1939360	1944360	They all look at him and then go back to chopping lettuce.
1945360	1948360	And then one guy will come up that's like,
1948360	1951360	Excuse me. Hello.
1951360	1955360	Because he thinks that when he does that, then that means go away.
1955360	1958360	But then he has to go to the phone. Everyone has a different relationship.
1958360	1960360	There's like a camera that goes into a laundromat.
1960360	1962360	There's a guy sitting at a table on a laundromat.
1962360	1964360	And the guy's just sitting at the table on a laundromat.
1964360	1967360	And he's watching this camera come toward him.
1967360	1969360	And the camera comes toward him.
1969360	1973360	And then just as it sits down at the table in the laundromat across from him,
1973360	1978360	the guy goes from totally just sitting there watching the camera to flipping out,
1978360	1981360	flips the table up into the camera, goes like,
1981360	1984360	What the fuck are you doing? Get the fuck out of here.
1984360	1987360	And starts chasing the guy with a chair.
1987360	1992360	And all this guy ever does, this guy is not a good person.
1992360	1993360	Not a good person.
1993360	1997360	Is a scuba diver a good person that goes in and looks at the fucking,
1997360	2000360	according to the fish? No. No. Not good. Get out of there.
2000360	2002360	You shouldn't be there. Don't be there.
2002360	2006360	I hope it's a kid because that seems like a good 17, 16-year-old kind of instance.
2006360	2009360	It feels like a phase that we all go through.
2009360	2011360	Well, I went through when I was...
2011360	2016360	But the interesting thing about it is there's a strangely uplifting component to it
2016360	2021360	because some people are grabbing at the camera,
2021360	2026360	literally just smash the guy in the face.
2026360	2030360	Does anybody just see the camera and just start singing Moon River really well?
2030360	2033360	There are. There are some like Ben and Jerry's kind of like old school,
2033360	2038360	like guys with big long beards like Spencer in 30 years.
2038360	2041360	I'll give you 30.
2041360	2046360	Some of them just cut to a guy with a big long gray beard and he's just staring.
2046360	2048360	Like he's waiting for a crosswalk and this guy came up to him
2048360	2051360	and so it just cuts to this guy that just stares into the camera
2051360	2054360	and he's waiting for something to give and then he goes,
2054360	2057360	I don't know, and walks off.
2057360	2064360	There is no heroic or villainous reaction to somebody dehumanizing you.
2064360	2067360	There is no...
2067360	2073360	None of the people who are on this video are good or bad people.
2073360	2077360	But the incredibly...
2077360	2080360	The epiphany I had while watching it was, oh my God,
2080360	2086360	I've just been given permission to look at people as if they are animals
2086360	2090360	because some of them are violent animals
2090360	2094360	and some of them are pacifistic animals
2094360	2097360	and some of them are herding around him.
2097360	2099360	He'll be like in the middle of a target
2099360	2102360	and then it's just people slowly encroaching on him going,
2102360	2104360	hey, what are you doing?
2104360	2106360	Hey, what are you doing?
2106360	2110360	And they're all kind of like ganging up on him
2110360	2113360	and then one fat guy will come up, hey, come on, what are you doing?
2113360	2115360	He's more of an alpha male.
2115360	2117360	I could just watch it for hours.
2117360	2120360	But the camera never turns, you never meet this guy, you never see him?
2120360	2123360	No, I think in the early ones people say, what are you doing?
2123360	2127360	And you hear the kid's voice go like, I'm making a video.
2127360	2129360	But I think he drops that after a while.
2129360	2132360	So he's like, he is Sacha Baron Cohen but without the ego.
2132360	2136360	I mean, let's assume this kid is the worst piece of shit in the world.
2136360	2140360	Let's assume he's pre-columbine, he's ready to...
2140360	2143360	Let's not pin any medals to his chest.
2143360	2149360	But all I know is that the content that's coming out the other side
2149360	2151360	I think is art.
2151360	2160360	Because I've had to watch people on YouTube a lot
2160360	2165360	and I've never been so fucking fascinated, which is really interesting.
2166360	2171360	And all he does is just say nothing and just get in people's faces with his camera.
2171360	2173360	What would your reaction be if somebody walked up to you?
2173360	2175360	I don't know, I don't know.
2175360	2178360	It might be different, it would be one thing on Tuesday, one thing on Wednesday.
2178360	2183360	Let's paint a picture, let's say that you're...
2184360	2186360	What do you do?
2189360	2193360	You're standing outside the drawing room on your phone, let's say.
2193360	2195360	Am I drunk?
2196360	2198360	Midway, you're not drunk yet, you've had a few.
2198360	2200360	Who am I talking to on the phone?
2200360	2201360	Aaron.
2201360	2202360	Is that Aaron on the phone?
2202360	2203360	Aaron's on the phone, everything's fine.
2203360	2204360	Good mood, bad mood.
2204360	2207360	Yeah, and then you're just out there and then...
2207360	2211360	So then you hang up the phone and now you're not talking to anybody.
2211360	2214360	Now you're taking the moment, it's a nice day out in California
2214360	2218360	and you're going through Instagrams or through tweets or whatever.
2218360	2220360	So now you're just idling out there.
2221360	2223360	So a guy comes up and he gets about...
2223360	2228360	This guy usually gets, if he's allowed to, he gets about a foot and a half.
2229360	2231360	It's personal space.
2231360	2233360	That's a bubble-burster for most people.
2233360	2237360	If he didn't have a camera with him, it would be weird.
2238360	2239360	The camera makes it less weird.
2239360	2242360	I want to stretch over and over and over again because we belong to this culture
2242360	2244360	where it's like, oh, he's a good person, he's a bad person.
2244360	2246360	I don't know what this person could be.
2246360	2248360	It doesn't matter.
2249360	2251360	So this day, you don't have a chip on your shoulders
2251360	2252360	and there's nothing really like...
2252360	2254360	And that guy just comes up, yeah.
2254360	2257360	But honestly, I just got off the phone with Aaron,
2257360	2260360	so I'm outside the drawing room, camera comes up and I go,
2260360	2263360	hello, hi.
2265360	2267360	So this guy just stands there and doesn't do anything?
2267360	2268360	Who are you?
2268360	2270360	Yeah, this is what often people are doing.
2270360	2273360	They're going like, hello, what are you doing?
2273360	2274360	What are you doing?
2274360	2277360	Now, then a bunch of people, some people go,
2277360	2279360	and I don't think these people are bad people at all.
2279360	2281360	They go...
2281360	2283360	And they fucking thrust.
2285360	2286360	Smack.
2287360	2289360	The camera goes black.
2289360	2290360	They punch him.
2290360	2292360	They grab his camera.
2292360	2296360	They grab and then he fades back like a bird.
2297360	2299360	And then moves, drifts back in.
2299360	2300360	Oh, really?
2300360	2302360	Like fucking Rocky Balboa?
2302360	2304360	Stay down, Rock.
2304360	2307360	Yeah, he just acts like a weather phenomenon.
2307360	2309360	I don't want to praise this person.
2309360	2312360	I don't think what he's doing is heroic.
2312360	2314360	So you've done ten seconds of what's going on.
2314360	2316360	I would go...
2316360	2317360	Do you walk away?
2317360	2318360	What are you doing?
2318360	2319360	Okay.
2319360	2322360	Here's what I think I would do in my current mood right now.
2322360	2323360	Right.
2323360	2325360	It happens as you leave the...
2325360	2326360	I just got off the phone with Aaron.
2326360	2327360	I'm not in a fight with Aaron.
2327360	2328360	I'm not in a bad mood.
2328360	2331360	I'm not feeling insecure about where I am in my life.
2331360	2333360	I get off the phone.
2333360	2334360	There's a guy doing this.
2334360	2335360	He's a stranger to me.
2335360	2337360	He's holding a camera in my face.
2337360	2338360	I would go, hello?
2338360	2339360	I would be like, hi.
2339360	2340360	What are you doing?
2340360	2341360	What are you doing?
2341360	2346360	And then after a while, I would try to find his...
2347360	2348360	Exhaustion point.
2348360	2352360	I would be like, yeah, no, no, no, no.
2352360	2354360	But that's me.
2354360	2356360	And I don't want to stress.
2356360	2357360	That's me in a good depth.
2357360	2359360	There's a million ways you could catch me where I'd be like,
2359360	2360360	what the fuck are you doing?
2360360	2363360	Let's say you and Aaron, there's tension brewing,
2363360	2366360	and let's say you got a call from, you know,
2366360	2369360	an irritating call from an agent or lawyer or...
2369360	2372360	Or like on the heels of me being all over the headlines
2372360	2374360	online with the chubby chasers.
2374360	2376360	Chubby chaser, chubby chaser, chubby chaser,
2376360	2377360	chubby chaser on Harvard.
2377360	2379360	You just assumed that was a paparazzo coming.
2379360	2384360	And I would be like, okay, hey, hey, chubby chaser.
2385360	2387360	And then the guy would be like, stay there.
2387360	2391360	And I'd be like, okay, so, chubby chaser.
2391360	2392360	I don't...
2392360	2395360	I think you should always do that whatever happens.
2397360	2398360	I think if a stranger walks up to you
2398360	2400360	and just tries to shake your hand, you should just...
2400360	2402360	I think the really interesting part of this series
2402360	2404360	is that you're not dealing with people who have
2404360	2406360	any relationship with cameras at all,
2406360	2408360	and that's the most interesting thing is that
2408360	2414360	we all have protocols that we initiate in
2414360	2417360	when we feel like something strange is happening to us.
2417360	2422360	And cameras dehumanize us, and we invented them
2422360	2424360	to try to capture humanity.
2424360	2428360	So we're used to using these things when we see them.
2428360	2432360	We're like, oh, I better be human now.
2432360	2436360	Hey, coming up next, camera face.
2436360	2437360	Coming at you.
2437360	2439360	And what these people are doing is they're putting
2439360	2442360	their poopy undies in a laundry machine,
2442360	2444360	and then there's a lens there.
2444360	2447360	And for me, the unspoken part of what some of them
2447360	2451360	are saying when they smash the camera is like,
2451360	2455360	hey, when I'm ready to have a camera on me,
2455360	2456360	I'll be really fucking...
2456360	2458360	I'll have my shit together.
2458360	2461360	You know, I'm going to say some amazing things,
2461360	2462360	and I'm going to...
2462360	2464360	There's something strange.
2464360	2470360	That's just my own interpretation because I'm coming
2471360	2472360	from a really specific place.
2472360	2475360	I think what's interesting about it is that it feels
2475360	2476360	like this kid...
2476360	2479360	I don't know if he's 15, 25, 48.
2479360	2485360	He might have a fucking tiger scars down his face.
2485360	2486360	He may look...
2486360	2488360	The whole point may be that this guy looks
2488360	2492360	like a fucking monster and has a camera.
2492360	2496360	What I'm seeing on the videos is the equivalent of,
2496360	2498360	if you took goggles and didn't even strap them
2498360	2501360	to the back of your head, but just put them down
2501360	2506360	in a Caribbean coral reef, and you're also looking
2506360	2508360	at people as if they're animals.
2508360	2510360	I've been asked several times...
2510360	2513360	I was on a show one time, and there was a sketch show,
2513360	2515360	a TV show, and also I've been asked to do other things
2515360	2516360	that were hidden camera shows.
2516360	2517360	I did one.
2517360	2518360	I did a Jimmy Kennedy experiment.
2518360	2519360	I don't like it.
2519360	2522360	I don't like ambush-style stuff.
2522360	2524360	Because those shows tend to...
2524360	2526360	Somebody kind of has to lose a little bit,
2526360	2529360	and I don't think it's funny when someone loses.
2529360	2531360	We were on Venice Beach doing these bits,
2531360	2533360	and this is a show called Danner Channel
2533360	2535360	that was on for six episodes a long time ago,
2535360	2538360	and we were on Venice Beach, and there was a crack house
2538360	2540360	looking place across the boardwalk.
2540360	2542360	That was where the hidden cameras were.
2542360	2544360	There was a guy dressed as a bum that was a cameraman,
2544360	2546360	so he's laying by, so there was cameras everywhere,
2546360	2549360	and I had glasses on early-day camera
2549360	2551360	in the middle of the glasses.
2551360	2553360	I was selling stuff, and I did this one
2553360	2555360	because I thought I could make it funny, kind of,
2555360	2557360	because I was selling dolphin jerky,
2557360	2560360	and people got really bummed out about it,
2560360	2562360	but also some people were like,
2562360	2564360	I'll try that dolphin jerky,
2564360	2567360	and there was a little sticker on it
2567360	2569360	with a picture of a tuna and a line through it,
2569360	2572360	like it was tuna safe,
2572360	2574360	but there was one we were selling,
2574360	2577360	and it was Che Guevara's.
2577360	2580360	It was a cereal, a Che Guevara-based cereal,
2580360	2582360	or your Che Crunchies or something like that,
2582360	2586360	and instead of green clovers and blue stars
2586360	2588360	or whatever the fuck, it was like hammers and sickles
2588360	2591360	and revolutionary stars,
2591360	2593360	and so I'm selling these Che Crunchies,
2593360	2595360	and these three girls come up,
2595360	2598360	and they're kind of tough.
2598360	2603360	I would describe, if I could guess what their lifestyle was,
2603360	2607360	anarchists or very left-leaning, possibly lesbian,
2607360	2611360	lots of piercings, probably very intellectual,
2611360	2614360	and also a little bit of LA street tough kind of,
2614360	2617360	like they didn't come from privilege or anything,
2617360	2620360	and they came up, and they were instantly just fucking bummed out about it,
2620360	2623360	and I have a little ear speaker or whatever they call it, earwig things,
2623360	2625360	and I have the producers saying like,
2625360	2627360	oh yeah, these are good, these are good,
2627360	2629360	go after these girls, go after these girls.
2629360	2631360	I'm like, I'm not gonna fucking go after these girls,
2631360	2632360	they're a killer, kill me, and they're like,
2632360	2634360	what the fuck's up with the cereal?
2634360	2636360	Do you think that Che Guevara, if you were allowed today,
2636360	2637360	would sign off on that?
2637360	2638360	Do you think it's family?
2638360	2641360	And I was like, no, no, no, half of the proceeds,
2641360	2642360	if you buy a box of Che Crunchies,
2642360	2647360	goes to the Zapatistas living in the hills of Chiapas.
2647360	2650360	And they're like, and the speaker, they're going, no, no, no,
2650360	2654360	antagonize him, I'm like, fuck you, look at him, fuck you.
2654360	2655360	I said, they're like, what?
2655360	2662360	I go, you know that Cubans invented cereal?
2662360	2665360	I go, this is a communist product, through and through,
2665360	2667360	this is a very lefty red,
2667360	2669360	I go, why, I go, you're probably too young,
2669360	2671360	but have you seen I Love Lucy?
2671360	2675360	I said, Ricky Riccardo is a Cuban,
2675360	2679360	and he eats cereal in every scene, because it's a Cuban,
2679360	2682360	and they were like, two of them were starting to go like,
2682360	2683360	for real?
2683360	2684360	Like, wow.
2684360	2686360	And then one of them was just like,
2686360	2688360	she was just staring at me, she wasn't buying it,
2688360	2691360	and then she saw the little dot inside of my glasses,
2691360	2693360	and she saw that it was a camera,
2693360	2695360	and then she realized that she was on a TV show.
2696360	2698360	And she looked at me, and she gave me this look,
2698360	2704360	and she goes, like, I go, I go, yeah.
2704360	2707360	So the people in the thing couldn't hear us,
2707360	2710360	and they're like, all right, I go, thank you.
2710360	2713360	They just left, but like, they asked me to do this thing where
2713360	2716360	there's people making sand art, and there's people selling stuff,
2716360	2718360	and there's people on the boardwalk that their whole lifestyle,
2718360	2721360	their whole living, is they do crazy shit on the boardwalk.
2721360	2724360	They make funky art, or they roll a skate and play guitar,
2724360	2726360	or they make sand castles and shit,
2726360	2728360	and they wanted me to come out there with a leaf blower
2728360	2731360	and just fuck around, and I was like, absolutely not,
2731360	2735360	because that's not funny to anyone but an asshole.
2735360	2736360	So another guy in the cast did it.
2736360	2737360	Guess what?
2737360	2740360	It wasn't in the show, because everyone wanted to fucking murder him.
2740360	2742360	Yeah, I don't like that stuff.
2742360	2743360	Although he did have the leaf blower,
2743360	2745360	and there's a bunch of Harry Christian guys
2745360	2748360	dancing and banging on cymbals and tambourines,
2748360	2750360	and they're like, rrrr!
2750360	2752360	And it was a really good shot, but it never aired on a thing.
2753360	2755360	I've been dancing with the Harry Christianists
2755360	2758360	while the leaf blowers blow their robes around,
2758360	2761360	but they're like, this is the best day of our lives,
2761360	2764360	which makes me like Harry Christianists a lot more.
2764360	2767360	When I think about cameras being on me all the time,
2767360	2771360	I actually, I would like to be part of a fairy tale
2771360	2772360	where I learn that this isn't true,
2772360	2774360	but I actually feel like the more the better.
2774360	2778360	Like, I feel like this strange perverse,
2778360	2785360	like, I just feel, I feel emotionally like somewhere
2785360	2788360	at the root of all of my developmental experience,
2788360	2795360	there's so much people catching you doing things.
2795360	2798360	People saying, you do what?
2798360	2799360	You're that way?
2799360	2800360	You that?
2800360	2801360	You do that?
2801360	2803360	And throughout your adult life.
2803360	2805360	I mean, this though?
2805360	2813360	If you're lucky enough to move forward in your adult life
2813360	2817360	that you can slowly, like, those things become jokes,
2817360	2820360	they become standup bits, they become sketches,
2820360	2822360	they become poems, they become Tumblr blogs,
2822360	2826360	they become things like you don't just shed them,
2826360	2829360	you actually drape them around you like feathers
2829360	2832360	and some amazing cloak, and you start to fly with them.
2832360	2836360	And I can't, like, I know that it's probably therefore
2836360	2841360	not healthy to say, all right, everybody just fucking gather around me,
2841360	2845360	put every camera you have on me, let's all go to bed together,
2845360	2849360	fucking try as hard as you can to catch me not being a good person.
2849360	2851360	I bet you can't.
2851360	2853360	It feels to me like a subversive act.
2853360	2856360	Like, what do you think you're going to catch me doing?
2856360	2858360	What do you think you're going to catch me thinking?
2858360	2864360	Everything that I think I say, do you really, really think that you live
2864360	2869360	in a world where everyone around you is going, is hiding things from you
2869360	2872360	and are you therefore hiding things from everyone?
2872360	2876360	Can we very, very slowly start to peel these masks away?
2876360	2879360	Can we talk to each other? Can we see each other?
2879360	2883360	And so I have a very twisted relationship with surveillance, these cameras.
2883360	2887360	I don't want the fucking NSA watching me through a laptop,
2887360	2890360	but I do want fans up in my grill.
2890360	2893360	I do want documentaries made about me.
2893360	2898360	I wish that I could create an orbit of fucking cameras around me.
2898360	2901360	I wish that I could be Truman in the Truman Show.
2901360	2904360	And I understand that compulsion.
2904360	2907360	And I always wonder, like, people who feel that way,
2907360	2911360	because those people, they're on reality shows and they cut each other up
2911360	2914360	and put each other in suitcases because they're crazy.
2914360	2917360	They want to be superstars. Like, what is that? Where is that?
2917360	2920360	Does part of you wish that you were an actor and that you were the kind of guy
2920360	2922360	that if you went to Little Dom's there'd be paparazzi everywhere?
2922360	2925360	No, no, not at all, because that's the opposite.
2925360	2928360	It's not... that's artifice.
2928360	2932360	I've been through that. It's the worst. It's terrible.
2932360	2934360	So what's the difference between those cameras being on you
2934360	2936360	and who are the other people with cameras that are...
2936360	2940360	I don't know, just an open channel. I just want that diaphragm dilated.
2940360	2946360	I just want... I just don't want to ever experience, ever again,
2946360	2951360	being the last person to know that I'm weird.
2951360	2957360	I just want to be the first person to say, this is who I am.
2957360	2962360	Like, I don't... I never...
2962360	2967360	I never actually felt that pad when people beat me up on the playground.
2967360	2971360	The thing that really made me feel bad was when the other guy came up and said,
2971360	2975360	don't beat him up, just because he's...
2975360	2978360	and he'd list the shit that you should be ashamed of.
2978360	2983360	Just because he's dirty and stinky and gross and he pees with his pants
2983360	2985360	around his ankles in the year and up.
2985360	2988360	Like, come on, he's a good guy and he wasn't a bad guy.
2988360	2991360	That guy was trying to stick up for me, but that's how I have to find out.
2991360	2995360	That's how I have to find out from a DMV clerk,
2995360	2998360	from a Verizon employee, from God, from government.
2998360	3001360	I'm going to be the guy that tells you who I am.
3001360	3008360	I'm not going to ever stand there in front of the fucking Krypton Tribunal
3008360	3011360	and be told that I have to go to the Phantom Zone.
3011360	3013360	I choose to go to the Phantom Zone.
3013360	3015360	I'll tell you what's wrong with me.
3015360	3018360	I hate Superman. He's a piece of shit.
3018360	3022360	I think he's dumb and stupid and he looks too good.
3022360	3025360	I have hatred inside of me.
3025360	3030360	I want to burn things with my eyes.
3030360	3032360	I'll tell you and then I'll be safe.
3032360	3035360	I'm not going to do anything bad to anybody.
3035360	3036360	That's why I...
3036360	3038360	Except Superman. You want to kill Superman.
3038360	3040360	Well, fuck that guy.
3040360	3041360	He seems to sign out.
3041360	3044360	He fucking came to Earth and got a job and a paper.
3044360	3045360	Won't tell anybody.
3045360	3046360	You want glasses?
3046360	3047360	You don't need glasses.
3047360	3050360	You can see everything.
3050360	3054360	Everyone that loves Superman loves fucking Lex Luthor.
3054360	3058360	That is the...
3058360	3061360	Fucking Lex Luthor is a human being.
3061360	3064360	Who the fuck is this asshole?
3064360	3066360	I'm smart. I can do anything.
3066360	3068360	Why am I being counted out?
3068360	3071360	He doesn't like Superman because he's good looking and can do everything?
3071360	3077360	Lex Luthor doesn't like Superman because he didn't have to deal with life on Earth.
3077360	3080360	Superman thinks he's fucking...
3080360	3084360	Every Superman movie they make over the last 40 years, it's like Superman.
3084360	3088360	Oh, let's really let people know how hard it is to be Superman.
3088360	3093360	What the fuck are you talking about?
3093360	3099360	He's a Harvard graduate on a galactic scale.
3099360	3105360	It's just stupid that he pretends he's from the Midwest.
3105360	3109360	It's just adding to it. It's fucking horrific.
3109360	3114360	Like, hey, sure wish I was good at football.
3114360	3116360	Fuck you.
3116360	3120360	Throw the ball as hard as you can.
3120360	3126360	And if you can throw it harder than us, let us figure out how to beat you and bury you.
3126360	3129360	You don't belong here. You're not a human.
3130360	3135360	I'll shave my head and I will fucking defeat you with my knowledge.
3135360	3140360	I might have to scour the universe to find what makes you weak.
3140360	3147360	I will fucking bring you down because I am super.
3147360	3150360	Because I wasn't born super.
3150360	3155360	I was born weak. That makes me strong.
3155360	3160360	And I lost my hair.
3160360	3163360	I don't even know if you know what that means.
3163360	3168360	For all I know, no man on your planet even has hair loss.
3168360	3170360	Jarell was bald too, wasn't he?
3170360	3174360	Yeah, by choice I bet.
3174360	3178360	I bet he looked in the mirror and was like, I bet I could be more super if I...
3178360	3181360	I don't know. I don't like that mythology. I don't like it.
3181360	3184360	So good.
3185360	3189360	What year did the first Superman come out? 70s? 78?
3189360	3194360	So you were five years old? Four years old? Five?
3194360	3199360	Whatever year you saw it, you weren't rooting for Superman?
3199360	3204360	No. You don't root for Superman.
3204360	3209360	You root for Lois Lane. You root for Jimmy Olsen. You root for Lex Luthor.
3210360	3215360	You may even root for Ned Beatty.
3215360	3218360	Mr. Luthor.
3218360	3222360	Sorry, I'm just trying to do my job.
3222360	3227360	I know you hate Superman so much, all I want to do is just do my fucking job, make people happy.
3227360	3232360	Yeah, I guess you do it for the good humans and then he is the force.
3232360	3236360	Superman can take a flying fucking fuck.
3236360	3239360	World's biggest donut.
3239360	3244360	If you listen to previous episodes of the show, I figured out, I didn't realize, I never understood it.
3244360	3249360	Superman was created by two little Jewish brothers.
3249360	3255360	They felt powerless and they created it at a time when that really meant something.
3255360	3258360	They were expressing something important.
3258360	3261360	And they pronounced it Superman.
3261360	3264360	Which I believe is a politics show.
3265360	3269360	I need to actually know that in order to appreciate Superman finally.
3269360	3274360	That means that when I'm looking at Superman, I'm actually thinking of those two kids.
3274360	3279360	Superman can fuck him. Fuck that guy.
3279360	3285360	If you approached and said, write a Superman movie, do you think you could make a Superman movie?
3285360	3288360	I could make any movie, Jeff.
3288360	3290360	Honestly.
3290360	3293360	Try to fix Superman for us right now. What's your approach on Superman?
3293360	3296360	Dan Harmon, fix his movie.
3310360	3313360	Fade in on the star field.
3313360	3316360	You know what? No, fuck that.
3316360	3318360	Let's use some modern convention.
3318360	3321360	Fade in on a bank teller.
3322360	3325360	Fuck, it's hard to work at a bank.
3325360	3330360	All right, I guess I'll just work at the bank again for the 150th day in a row.
3330360	3332360	No actual change.
3332360	3335360	Yeah, I'd like to make a withdrawal.
3335360	3337360	Yeah, in what amount?
3337360	3339360	Everything you got.
3339360	3343360	I said everybody, get down on the fucking floor.
3343360	3346360	I want all your fucking money.
3346360	3349360	I don't give a shit, you bunch of black women.
3349360	3352360	He's a bad person.
3352360	3358360	In a bad economy, you have to add that.
3358360	3361360	Because otherwise people would be like, I'm on this guy's side.
3361360	3368360	You black women, get on the floor, you fucking minorities and cripples, I want your money.
3371360	3376360	You know, it's rude to ask for things without permission.
3376360	3382360	What the fuck? Hey, who are you, you fucking faggot pansy?
3382360	3389360	Why are you wearing a faggot, gay, gay, blue, gay?
3389360	3392360	I hate gay people outfit.
3395360	3397360	That's all I have to wear.
3397360	3401360	I didn't wake up, tried to make you happy.
3401360	3405360	Well, you're going to die making me mad.
3407360	3409360	Close up of the bullet.
3419360	3424360	What the fuck, you fucking faggot, motherfucker faggot?
3424360	3427360	I'm so angry, motherfucking angry.
3427360	3431360	Faggots, I hate your gay ass, homosexual faggot ass.
3434360	3442360	You faggot fucking hate, I fucking hate faggots.
3443360	3448360	Next time I suggest you explore your hatred of people who are different from you
3448360	3452360	through more healthy means than rubbing it back.
3453360	3459360	Superman logo, cold open, written by Dan Harmon, directed by Dan Harmon, fuck it.
3459360	3464360	I finally, I've had enough, I've had enough, I'll do it.
3469360	3470360	Come out of the title sequence.
3470360	3473360	You didn't think you'd ever see that guy again, but you do, it's on his face.
3473360	3476360	It's Chris Pratt, he steals this movie.
3477360	3482360	You faggot, you faggot, homosexual faggot.
3483360	3488360	Thanks Superman for arresting another bank robber.
3488360	3491360	Guess this guy kind of hates gay people.
3492360	3494360	Yeah, I don't get it really myself.
3494360	3496360	Hey Superman, can you come to my office?
3496360	3498360	Sure, Lieutenant.
3499360	3505360	You're not going to try to confine me to it and reveal a giant robot spider.
3505360	3510360	No, Superman, I think we all agree that you're in control of the population.
3511360	3514360	Just us ants making shit work.
3515360	3519360	I would like to pretend that you're a human, sit down with you and talk to you.
3520360	3521360	Detect a little bit of aggression.
3521360	3523360	Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3523360	3526360	That's the way our last conversation went, it's sit down.
3526360	3529360	Pretend you ever need to sit.
3529360	3537360	I know that if you and I had a standing contest, I'd turn into a skeleton.
3538360	3543360	Just humor me, do an impression of a person sitting.
3545360	3548360	I can sense, you can sense everything!
3549360	3550360	I'm sorry, sit down.
3550360	3552360	Who plays this lieutenant?
3552360	3553360	This is Gary Sneeze.
3553360	3560360	Superman, my job is twofold.
3561360	3564360	Stop crime, which you have eliminated.
3565360	3568360	Keep the peace, which you're exacerbating.
3568360	3569360	What do you mean?
3569360	3571360	I'm about to tell you.
3572360	3573360	Everyone hates you.
3573360	3574360	What do you mean?
3574360	3577360	You're a pajama man from outer space.
3578360	3583360	Society is built on the principle that if you work hard enough, you can become good.
3584360	3588360	You drifted in from the clouds and are better than anyone can ever be.
3589360	3593360	Every time someone tries to do something wrong, you beat them up with your eyebrow.
3594360	3598360	As police chief, this poses a problem for me in the long term.
3598360	3600360	I would like you to take a break.
3600360	3602360	I would like you to go somewhere.
3602360	3607360	Just let the city feel what it feels like to be human again.
3607360	3612360	But I thought people like, just trust me, go away.
3612360	3618360	Just go away, go sit on a rock and shit in a bag and eat it.
3619360	3625360	If you care, if you care about humanity, go fuck off.
3626360	3628360	I'm afraid I can't do that.
3628360	3632360	So you just said, Superman, I'm going to pull out my iPhone.
3632360	3634360	I'm going to record this conversation.
3634360	3635360	Is that okay?
3635360	3637360	Well, I have a photographic memory.
3637360	3639360	It's for me, motherfucker.
3639360	3640360	It's for me.
3642360	3645360	Tell me you don't give a shit about Metropolis.
3645360	3647360	Tell me it's about you, motherfucker.
3647360	3649360	I didn't say that.
3649360	3651360	Tell me you refuse to leave.
3651360	3653360	Tell me you refuse to leave.
3653360	3655360	I live here.
3655360	3657360	I'm asking you to leave.
3657360	3658360	Do you hate crime?
3658360	3660360	I don't think people should care about it.
3660360	3663360	Crime is happening still because of you.
3663360	3665360	You make everyone feel weak.
3665360	3667360	Everyone's going to keep acting out.
3667360	3669360	Can you take a two-week break?
3669360	3672360	Can we have a parade where you're not around?
3672360	3674360	Can we be flawed?
3674360	3676360	Can we be rough around the edges?
3676360	3678360	Can you go away?
3678360	3679360	Do you have a mother?
3679360	3680360	Do you have an uncle?
3680360	3682360	Do you have a hobby?
3682360	3684360	Is this Gary Sinise?
3684360	3686360	It might be me.
3686360	3696360	I need to hear more people than you say this.
3696360	3697360	Okay.
3697360	3699360	Emergency town hall meeting.
3699360	3701360	Yeah, get out of here.
3701360	3702360	Get out.
3702360	3703360	Boo.
3703360	3704360	Get out.
3704360	3705360	Get out.
3705360	3706360	Boo.
3706360	3707360	Boo.
3707360	3708360	Boo.
3708360	3709360	I don't understand.
3709360	3710360	I don't understand.
3710360	3711360	Why is everyone not like me?
3711360	3713360	I'm better than everyone.
3713360	3716360	You can't understand that.
3716360	3717360	Get out.
3717360	3718360	Okay, I'm leaving.
3718360	3719360	I'm leaving.
3719360	3730360	Two weeks later on Superman's chosen island where the indigenous population was just left.
3730360	3738360	I guess I'll eat another coconut by opening it with my laser eyes.
3738360	3742360	Oh, yeah, I don't need to eat anything.
3742360	3745360	Oh, here I am.
3745360	3749360	It's the most Superman on island 134.
3749360	3754360	Meanwhile, in Metropolis, hey, someone got mugged today.
3754360	3755360	You know what?
3755360	3759360	You probably needed some money.
3759360	3760360	You know what?
3760360	3763360	It's kind of an acceptable crime rate.
3763360	3770360	Just the threat that Superman might ever come back is actually putting us way above Flint, Michigan.
3770360	3771360	This is great.
3771360	3777360	Yeah, but, Chief, Superman's due to come back next Thursday.
3777360	3778360	Fuck.
3778360	3779360	Shit.
3779360	3782360	Who can kill Superman?
3782360	3783360	I can.
3783360	3784360	Lex Luthor?
3784360	3785360	Yes.
3785360	3788360	I have dedicated my life to figuring out how.
3788360	3789360	How can you do it?
3789360	3790360	With this green knife?
3790360	3791360	Okay.
3791360	3792360	Go do it.
3792360	3793360	NASA, can you help?
3793360	3794360	Yeah, we're happy to.
3794360	3799360	He's also putting us out of business.
3799360	3800360	Here's the thing.
3800360	3801360	Superman can't lie.
3801360	3802360	Let's call him up.
3802360	3803360	Hey, Superman.
3803360	3806360	Or just talk like a dog and he'll hear us.
3806360	3807360	Hey, Superman.
3807360	3809360	Yeah, you need anything?
3809360	3810360	Anybody?
3810360	3811360	A giant robot spider?
3811360	3814360	No, where are you?
3814360	3815360	West of Jamaica.
3815360	3816360	Okay, we'll be right there.
3816360	3817360	Go, go, go, go.
3817360	3819360	Do, do, do, do, do.
3819360	3820360	I love coconuts.
3820360	3825360	Oh, God, God, he's stabbing me to death with kryptonite, a kryptonite knife.
3825360	3827360	Oh, my super heart.
3827360	3830360	I won't beat anymore because it's been stabbed.
3830360	3831360	No one's ever tried this.
3831360	3834360	Just make a fucking knife on a kryptonite.
3834360	3835360	Stab him.
3835360	3836360	Stab him.
3836360	3837360	Stab him.
3837360	3839360	His heart beats.
3839360	3840360	Something's in there.
3840360	3842360	He's not animated flesh.
3842360	3844360	He's a super person.
3844360	3845360	He has a heart somewhere.
3845360	3847360	Stab him with kryptonite.
3847360	3854360	Shank, shank, shank, shank, shank, stab, stab, stab, stab.
3854360	3862360	Jeremy Renner is the shaved head Jeremy Renner.
3862360	3866360	I beat you.
3866360	3869360	It's in the way that you use it.
3869360	3870360	Credits.
3870360	3871360	Credits.
3871360	3872360	Credits.
3872360	3873360	Yeah, credits.
3873360	3880360	Death to Superman.
3880360	3882360	Death to Superman.
3882360	3884360	There's no Lois Lane in that movie?
3884360	3889360	Eh, she, she, what, what?
3889360	3893360	I, I'll, I'll bring in a Lois Lane consultant.
3893360	3894360	What do you mean?
3894360	3895360	Alright, I'm just asking.
3895360	3896360	I guess not.
3896360	3897360	No, there's no Lois Lane in it.
3897360	3904360	So we just root for like, like, the, the, the, the Lieutenant and Lex Luthor.
3904360	3906360	What about all the people he saved throughout this time?
3906360	3907360	There's lots of people that-
3907360	3909360	They went on with their lives.
3909360	3911360	But wouldn't they be grateful and feel bad?
3911360	3914360	To, to what end?
3914360	3915360	Humanity.
3915360	3918360	Well, they're gonna show up every time Superman's in trouble now?
3918360	3919360	That's not saving.
3919360	3921360	That's, that town hall meeting, for instance, when everyone's like,
3921360	3923360	boo, boo, boo, wouldn't it be an old lady in the back?
3923360	3925360	Well, he saved my husband from falling off.
3925360	3926360	He saved my-
3926360	3927360	You're right.
3927360	3930360	No, it's, it's, well, that was 20 minutes of movies an hour and a half.
3930360	3931360	Okay.
3931360	3933360	There's shit like that.
3933360	3934360	Okay, okay, good.
3934360	3935360	So there are people that-
3935360	3937360	No, it's a complicated film.
3937360	3938360	Right.
3939360	3942360	There are so many people who have a complicated relationship with Superman.
3942360	3945360	I think it's a big role for Gary Sinise to tackle.
3945360	3946360	Yeah.
3946360	3950360	I'm out of breath just auditioning for it.
3950360	3952360	Just knocking him out.
3952360	3953360	All right.
3953360	3954360	Jesus Christ.
3954360	3956360	I just don't think that Superman's a compelling character.
3956360	3960360	He's born too gifted.
3960360	3962360	Is that a problem?
3962360	3963360	No.
3963360	3964360	No.
3964360	3965360	Nope.
3965360	3966360	Nope.
3966360	3971360	I do think knowing that like, you know, if you know that the two Jewish kids made him,
3971360	3976360	I think that's heart wrenching because they're like, what if you were a fucking Superman?
3976360	3979360	And it's like, holy shit, Jesus Christ, I'm not going to take that away from you.
3979360	3984360	Except you just did with a kryptonite knife.
3984360	3985360	Well, that's, yeah, yeah.
3985360	3994360	It's kind of a, kind of a Nazi movie.
3994360	3997360	The super actually becomes like the, yeah, you're right.
3997360	3998360	No, you're right.
3998360	3999360	That is terrible.
3999360	4001360	That's the, that's the complicated thing.
4001360	4005360	You took the only mythology that you have that when they rise up.
4005360	4006360	I take exception to that.
4006360	4010360	I did not take the only mythology Jews have away from them.
4010360	4016360	I mean, like super hero, like redemptive post world war two, like cultural shit.
4016360	4017360	Yes.
4017360	4021360	If you're a Superman fan, I wouldn't mind talking to you.
4021360	4022360	All right.
4022360	4023360	All right.
4023360	4024360	Get this guy up here.
4024360	4025360	Come on.
4025360	4032360	And you're going to play D and D with us too.
4032360	4034360	He's got a mega man t-shirt.
4034360	4035360	What's your name, sir?
4035360	4036360	Eric.
4036360	4037360	Eric.
4037360	4038360	I write comics here.
4038360	4039360	All right.
4039360	4040360	Now you're doing the thing.
4040360	4041360	Okay.
4041360	4044360	The, like, I don't want to, we don't, I'm not bullying you.
4044360	4049360	But I've never had a conversation with anybody that says that your ear lobes have the earrings
4050360	4053360	in them that where you widen your ear lobes.
4053360	4054360	They do.
4054360	4055360	What are those called exactly?
4055360	4056360	Gauges.
4056360	4057360	It's like awesome marks.
4057360	4058360	Gauges.
4058360	4059360	Awesome marks.
4059360	4060360	Stretched ears.
4060360	4061360	Yeah.
4061360	4062360	It's like a tribal kind of thing.
4062360	4063360	But Superman, more importantly, Superman.
4063360	4064360	What are they called?
4064360	4065360	They're called gauges.
4065360	4066360	Stretched ears.
4066360	4067360	They're called gauged ears.
4067360	4069360	Gauge is like a, it's like an inch or a mile.
4069360	4071360	Gauge means like the width.
4071360	4072360	Stretched ears.
4072360	4073360	Stretched ears.
4073360	4074360	Now here's some questions.
4074360	4075360	Did they ever come out?
4075360	4078360	Do you take them out at night and clean them or did you leave them in?
4078360	4079360	Do you want to find out?
4079360	4082360	This is, the night is young.
4082360	4085360	I'm going to fuck your ear lobes, man.
4085360	4086360	Let's do it.
4086360	4087360	That's what I'm saying.
4087360	4090360	I'll stretch your fucking ears.
4090360	4095360	I'm going to fucking get you a bigger gauge, motherfucker.
4095360	4098360	But you're sick of those questions.
4098360	4100360	Like your aunt Trudy will ask that question.
4100360	4102360	I did when I was 16 and I'm like 28 now.
4102360	4103360	You've been doing it that long.
4103360	4105360	Well, I did it like for one year in high school.
4105360	4106360	I did that.
4106360	4108360	I just always wonder my, my big question.
4108360	4112360	I am your aunt Trudy and I'm asking you tomorrow.
4112360	4115360	Let's say you go, eh, forget it.
4115360	4116360	Now what happens?
4116360	4117360	What are the, do they shrink?
4117360	4119360	Do they, do they live tattoos too?
4119360	4122360	I have a bunch of like things in my body permanently that like.
4122360	4124360	But do you, but do the earlobes, they just look wonky.
4124360	4127360	They look wonky already obviously, but yeah, they just, they heal it weird.
4127360	4128360	I'm not Wolverine.
4128360	4129360	Unfortunately.
4129360	4130360	All right.
4130360	4131360	I apologize.
4131360	4136360	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not like, I do a million things that I'm mad if people
4136360	4138360	ask me why I do them.
4138360	4139360	That's fine.
4139360	4143360	I'm literally only asking like, cause I can't, I can't at the bar.
4143360	4145360	I can't go up to somebody and ask those questions.
4145360	4149360	So I thought I would take the opportunity because it would be a tool.
4149360	4155360	If I did that, I get a lot of like, and now I just offended somebody by making
4155360	4159360	that impression of a, yeah, but, but, but I, I, I, yeah, I just, you're the first
4159360	4161360	person I've ever actually had the opportunity to ask you.
4161360	4162360	All right.
4162360	4163360	What was your name?
4163360	4164360	Eric.
4164360	4165360	Eric.
4165360	4166360	All right.
4166360	4167360	So, uh, why were you up here again?
4167360	4168360	Superman.
4168360	4169360	Superman.
4169360	4170360	Wow.
4170360	4171360	Superman.
4171360	4172360	I had a question actually.
4172360	4173360	Make us like Superman or you have a question.
4173360	4174360	Yeah.
4174360	4176360	Just as a person who is all oftentimes like, I see you as a Clark Kent type
4176360	4177360	character.
4177360	4180360	You're an exceptional person and there are folks who hate you for trying and they,
4180360	4184360	they, they, uh, they want, they want, they want to tear you down for daring to
4184360	4185360	fly.
4185360	4188360	And that's kind of the Clark Kent story.
4188360	4191360	It's a, it's a man who's like trying to be his best self and who made me a
4191360	4192360	challenge again.
4192360	4193360	Clark Kent is a lie.
4193360	4194360	Clark Kent isn't a real person.
4194360	4197360	Well, no, he was, he was born like he was an adopted guy and he grew up without
4197360	4199360	powers and he gradually grew into him.
4199360	4200360	It's like puberty.
4200360	4202360	But he was like, that was his identity.
4202360	4204360	It wasn't like he's like, now I'm going to hide his Clark Kent.
4204360	4207360	He grew up as Clark Kent and eventually formed the Superman identity.
4207360	4208360	Okay.
4208360	4209360	I never thought about it.
4209360	4212360	I, I, I guess I knew that, but wasn't looking at it that way.
4212360	4213360	Yeah.
4213360	4214360	I didn't really think about that.
4214360	4215360	Superman is who you are when the cameras are on it.
4215360	4216360	It's your higher self.
4216360	4217360	That's him trying to be the best.
4217360	4218360	And Clark isn't really like that.
4218360	4220360	Like he uses a different tone of voice.
4220360	4222360	He parts his hair in a different part of his head.
4222360	4224360	Like he dresses differently, obviously.
4224360	4227360	It's him trying to be his best self and putting his best foot forward.
4227360	4230360	I think at home in the fortress of solitude, I think he needs that because he
4230360	4232360	has the like, Oh fuck, what am I doing?
4232360	4233360	I'm not sure.
4233360	4234360	I understand.
4234360	4235360	Yeah.
4235360	4236360	Well, I guess that, I guess that makes it really interesting.
4236360	4240360	The idea that he might, my question is what makes the character interesting.
4240360	4245360	Cause my question is at a certain point when he finally for the fifth time
4245360	4249360	realizes that he can go anywhere, live anywhere, do whatever he wants.
4249360	4252360	He can, he can make his nose make money.
4252360	4256360	Like, like, like there's so like Superman just could do whatever he wants.
4256360	4257360	He would crush a coal and a diamond.
4257360	4262360	There's an emotional component of his actual, he's like, yeah, but where's
4262360	4263360	home? Who am I?
4263360	4264360	Isn't that lonely?
4264360	4266360	Like, haven't you ever like, I don't know.
4266360	4269360	I used to have a girlfriend who I loved dearly who wasn't, he didn't really
4269360	4271360	do the kind of things I did.
4271360	4274360	He was kind of like a, like a common person and there's nothing wrong with
4274360	4276360	that, but I wanted to do more.
4276360	4277360	I wanted to move to LA.
4277360	4278360	I wanted to succeed in writing.
4278360	4282360	And this person was just someone who had like a menial kind of like Walmart job.
4282360	4284360	And that was very lonely for me.
4284360	4285360	I couldn't relate to her.
4285360	4289360	And I see Clark Kent as that kind of like constantly ostracized by Lex Luthor
4289360	4291360	and those kind of like Twitter assholes.
4291360	4294360	And then personally, like his only friend is Batman.
4294360	4296360	He's like the baddest ass guy in the world.
4296360	4297360	Wait a minute.
4297360	4302360	He's saying the best version of him is the Clark Kent side of his life because
4302360	4305360	that's him trying to be human and be loved and be like, he's aspiring.
4305360	4307360	He actually doesn't think of himself as Superman.
4307360	4310360	I kind of like, I have to suck myself up in the morning to go like go outside
4310360	4311360	and talk to people.
4311360	4313360	I feel like that's him putting on a Superman ass.
4313360	4314360	He believes that he is Clark Kent.
4314360	4315360	That's who he is.
4315360	4316360	Yeah.
4316360	4318360	Because that's what it says on his birth certificate.
4318360	4320360	And that's what it says in his yearbook.
4320360	4324360	So when he has to go into the phone booth and become Superman, is he bummed out
4324360	4325360	about that?
4325360	4326360	Is that a burden for him?
4326360	4328360	I think it's just another role.
4328360	4330360	I don't think he really identifies as Superman.
4330360	4331360	It's a job he has to do.
4331360	4334360	And he has to keep it separate from, he is actually protecting Clark Kent.
4334360	4336360	I never looked at it that way.
4336360	4337360	All right.
4337360	4338360	I like Superman now.
4338360	4339360	All right.
4339360	4340360	Eric, everybody.
4340360	4341360	Wait, no.
4341360	4342360	No, stay.
4342360	4343360	Stay.
4343360	4344360	Stay, Eric.
4344360	4346360	Because we got to play Dungeons and Dragons.
4346360	4349360	How many characters do we need?
4349360	4352360	Well, we typically roll with four characters, but you know.
4352360	4357360	So we need, let's not to look, not that I see gender, but let's get a young lady
4357360	4359360	up here or an old lady.
4360360	4362360	Not that I see age either.
4362360	4363360	What did you say?
4363360	4364360	My Lois Lane is here.
4364360	4365360	Hannah Partlett.
4365360	4367360	But that would be unfair, wouldn't it?
4367360	4369360	We need to get someone else's Lois Lane up here.
4369360	4375360	Or someone who is their own She-Ra.
4375360	4376360	Wonder Woman.
4376360	4383360	Is there anyone who happens to have more ovaries than testes that wants to play D&D
4383360	4384360	tonight?
4384360	4385360	No?
4385360	4386360	Okay.
4386360	4387360	Good.
4387360	4388360	Fine.
4388360	4389360	I saw you.
4389360	4391360	I saw you shrugging.
4391360	4392360	Wait.
4392360	4394360	You played before that, right?
4394360	4395360	You've never played?
4395360	4396360	Who's back there?
4396360	4397360	I actually played once, too.
4397360	4398360	I could swap out.
4398360	4401360	Well, let's not unravel the whole carpet.
4401360	4405360	Dan, is it all the counterintuitive?
4405360	4407360	Let's bring up his girlfriend.
4407360	4408360	Is it your girlfriend?
4408360	4409360	Yeah.
4409360	4410360	Okay.
4410360	4411360	This is not the one, the Walmart one.
4411360	4412360	No, no.
4412360	4413360	Okay.
4413360	4414360	Thank God.
4414360	4416360	Give it to someone else.
4416360	4419360	I hang out at your house.
4419360	4420360	Oh, that's you?
4420360	4421360	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4421360	4423360	Well, who's in back there?
4423360	4424360	I saw a hand come up.
4424360	4425360	Who is it?
4425360	4426360	I thought I saw...
4426360	4427360	Anywhere else?
4427360	4428360	Yes, yes.
4428360	4429360	You.
4429360	4430360	Come on up.
4430360	4431360	Come on up.
4431360	4432360	Yeah.
4432360	4433360	Yeah.
4433360	4434360	Yeah.
4434360	4435360	Yeah.
4435360	4436360	Yeah.
4436360	4437360	Yeah.
4437360	4438360	Yeah.
4438360	4439360	Yeah.
4439360	4440360	Yeah.
4440360	4441360	Yeah.
4441360	4442360	Yeah.
4442360	4443360	Yeah.
4443360	4444360	Yeah.
4444360	4445360	What's your name?
4445360	4446360	Laurel.
4446360	4447360	Laurel?
4447360	4448360	Laurel.
4448360	4449360	Laurel.
4449360	4450360	Oh, Laurel.
4450360	4451360	Laurel.
4451360	4452360	Have we met, Laura?
4452360	4453360	No, we have not.
4453360	4454360	Okay.
4454360	4455360	And Eric.
4455360	4456360	Okay.
4456360	4457360	All right.
4457360	4458360	Thank you for coming up.
4458360	4459360	Sorry, that was so arduous.
4459360	4462360	I wasn't here last week, and I forgot to listen to the episode, so I don't know what happened.
4462360	4465360	How did you forget?
4465360	4466360	I was out of town.
4466360	4469360	I meant to listen to the next day, and I just got distracted, and then I forgot all about
4469360	4470360	it.
4470360	4471360	Okay.
4471360	4474280	I normally, when I'm not here, listen to the D&D part at least, just so I'm caught up
4474280	4475280	on that, but it isn't.
4475280	4476280	All right.
4476280	4480120	If you guys can figure this out, one of you is Krista Berg and one of you is Mulrain Sedana.
4480120	4481120	It's all made up.
4481120	4482720	Eric and Laura, are you familiar with these characters a bit?
4482720	4483720	I am, yeah.
4483720	4484720	A little bit.
4484720	4485720	A little bit.
4485720	4486720	Probably more than Dan and I.
4486720	4487720	All right.
4487720	4488720	Yeah.
4488720	4490640	Hand me over the corks.
4490640	4491640	Yeah.
4491640	4495000	Grab yours off the top there.
4495000	4496960	They're all cleverly placed in top to bottom.
4496960	4497960	Eric, you're Krista Berg.
4497960	4498960	Laura, you're Mulrain.
4498960	4499960	You're Mulrain there?
4499960	4500960	Yeah.
4501560	4502560	It's exciting stuff.
4502560	4503560	Shit.
4503560	4504560	Sorry.
4504560	4510240	You got mine too?
4510240	4512800	Take the top two sheets and pass them down.
4512800	4513800	There you are.
4513800	4514800	Okay.
4514800	4515800	We did it.
4515800	4516800	Yeah.
4516800	4517800	This show is podcast gold.
4517800	4518800	Podcast gold.
4518800	4523440	I didn't see it with the apartment town when they passed the papers around for 10 minutes.
4523440	4524600	You didn't see it.
4524600	4525600	You weren't there, man.
4525600	4526600	You had to be there, man.
4526600	4527600	You were passing shit around.
4527600	4530600	You were passing shit around.
4531240	4532240	There was a bunch of dead air.
4532240	4533240	It was really good.
4533240	4534240	There were six sheets and then four.
4534240	4535240	Yeah.
4535240	4538240	You said, I heard you just passed the papers.
4538240	4540360	You sound like you were really excited about it.
4540360	4542360	Tell me about it.
4542360	4543360	Oh, yeah.
4543360	4544360	Yeah.
4544360	4545360	Tyler asked.
4545360	4547720	He likes the idea that there's a Harbontown fan that talks like that.
4547720	4554680	Man, Harbontown was really rocking last night.
4554680	4558440	It was a super out of space pajama man of episode.
4558440	4562400	I didn't think Dan would pick chili, but he picked it their goodness here.
4562400	4567600	I think it's pretty amazing that, not that it was a Herculean effort, but that you softened
4567600	4570920	Dan's dance on Superman in about eight sentences.
4570920	4571920	Really did.
4571920	4574680	Actually, yeah, it's true.
4574680	4577480	It's just a matter of quickly shifting one important thing.
4577480	4580200	But the fact that you don't take that away from Superman, that you don't remember it
4580200	4584760	that way, that you've taken another stanza.
4584760	4591360	Because you think about it in terms of comic books that you may or may not have ever read,
4591360	4596560	and I think that, of course, I've never read a Superman comic book.
4596560	4601360	I am familiar with Superman from a certain perspective, and I always identify with a
4601360	4602360	criminal.
4602360	4603360	No, Eric.
4603360	4608160	Because I never actually, and I was aware that, okay, yeah, he came down to Earth and
4608160	4613120	he was raised by these parents in Smallville.
4613120	4617000	There was a tissue paper thin thing that needed to be poked through.
4617000	4619560	Somebody needed to go, no, he thinks he's Clark Kent.
4619560	4620560	He doesn't think he's Superman.
4620560	4624680	Now, Eric, I've only seen the movies, and I've never read a Superman comic.
4624680	4627680	Does that come through in the movies, do you think?
4627680	4628680	More so in the comics.
4628680	4631920	I'm a big fan of the comics, the Mark Waid stuff, and Smallville was cool for Lex Luthor
4631920	4632920	too.
4632920	4634800	They had the idea there that there was a guy who was very exceptional and used to getting
4634800	4638280	his own way, and the Harvard graduate in the room, and he was this new kid, and that was
4638280	4639280	kind of fun in that series.
4639280	4640280	Yeah.
4640280	4643800	Everyone, if someone else gets something, they're not taking anything away from you,
4643800	4647480	and that's the central idea that Lex Luthor can't understand, that he can't just succeed
4647480	4648480	alongside you.
4648480	4652080	He has to have it all himself, and that's really compelling to me.
4652080	4656360	But no, I don't think that they really delve into that, Jeff, what you were asking about.
4656360	4660480	I don't think ... They really dropped the ball with those narrative opportunities because
4660480	4665120	they don't really provide a good case on why he's alienated and stuff.
4665120	4668680	They just make it seem like it's great, and then in one scene it really sucks to be him,
4668680	4669680	and then it's great again.
4670080	4673680	Well, now he murders dudes, now he's super alone, because he's like this ultra cop, and
4673680	4674680	he's this guy who's responsible.
4674680	4675680	He's a super dad.
4675680	4677400	He's responsible for everyone on the planet.
4677400	4678400	Now Lex is correct.
4678400	4679400	It's weird.
4679400	4682200	But there's no greater superhero than Iron Man.
4682200	4683200	Well, agreed.
4683200	4684200	Yeah, naturally.
4684200	4685200	Because he's like super flawed.
4685200	4686720	Because he's not a superhero.
4686720	4688800	Yeah, he and Spider-Man are really relatable.
4688800	4693760	He's a fucking human being that earned everything and pays the price through alcoholism.
4693760	4697200	He's like, nothing.
4697200	4699560	No radioactive spider, nothing.
4699600	4702600	I respect Spider-Man, but you get bit by a spider.
4702600	4705280	I mean, I tried being a dude.
4705280	4709800	But his dad was like a real ... He was raised pretty.
4709800	4710800	He was raised by Howard Hughes.
4710800	4711800	Pretty well off.
4711800	4712800	Yeah.
4712800	4713800	Yeah.
4713800	4714800	He's going to live up to that shit.
4714800	4715800	He earned it all himself.
4715800	4716800	Yeah, and those movies are fucking awesome.
4716800	4717800	Yeah, no.
4717800	4718800	Maybe not the third one.
4718800	4724120	I've never seen an Iron Man thing, so he was born wealthy though, right?
4724120	4728200	Yeah, his dad was like almost as good of a genius as he was, and also pretty successful
4728200	4729200	in that picture.
4729200	4730760	Yeah, radioactive spider is anything else.
4730760	4731760	But now he's ...
4731760	4732760	Right, but okay.
4732760	4733760	He's rebelling now, though, with flamethrower.
4733760	4734760	It's more like bad.
4734760	4738880	Now he's a hero and giving back to humanity, because his dad just took ... His dad was
4738880	4740520	like this little kind of brandy Superman.
4740520	4745680	Tony Stark's dad ... Yeah, Tony Stark's dad is as good as Tony Stark, but okay.
4745680	4752640	Tony Stark is as smart as his dad, if not more, and fucking took it and ran with it.
4752640	4755680	And yeah, he's a solipsist, and he's like ...
4755680	4758400	But his dad built weapons, and all their money comes from blood money.
4758400	4762840	And now his son's a hero, so he's going to save people, kind of a tone with that father.
4762840	4763840	Yeah.
4763840	4764840	All right.
4764840	4765840	Camera.
4765840	4766840	Good superhero.
4766840	4767840	All right.
4767840	4768840	All right.
4768840	4769840	I'll just do those movies.
4769840	4770840	If you want to borrow some comics, I mean ...
4770840	4771840	Look, look.
4771840	4772840	We're already dating.
4772840	4773840	We've established that.
4773840	4775640	I'm trying, man.
4775640	4779720	In the morning when I'm leaving and I put a rose on your pillow, I'm taking some of your
4779720	4781120	comics with me.
4781120	4783040	I'm making Tumblr jellies.
4783040	4786560	Wait, you're making Tumblr jello?
4786560	4787560	Tumblr jellies.
4787560	4788560	Okay, wow.
4788560	4790560	I want to try your famous Tumblr jello.
4790560	4792560	Well, that's for breakfast.
4792560	4793560	All right.
4793560	4794560	Let's play some D&D for pity's sake.
4794560	4795560	All right.
4795560	4800560	All right.
4800560	4805840	Last time on Harmontown, after getting to the floating Isle of Paradise, our heroes met
4805840	4812960	with the island's guardian, Yomiji the Angel, and together cured Christopher of his possession.
4812960	4816880	However, in the process, they freed Admiral Darkstar.
4816880	4822680	With his new ghastly form, Darkstar possessed Yomiji and assaulted the gang mercilessly.
4822680	4827840	Quark accidentally set the island on fire, and Paradise began falling from the sky.
4827840	4831880	Acting quickly, Mo-Rein leapt for the portal, catching the razor-sharp rim and pulling
4831880	4839200	herself into Bill Martigan's, and with our rope managed to pull the rest of our heroes
4839200	4840440	to safety.
4840440	4845400	As Darkstar flew away in his heavenly host, our hero relished their victory, heading to
4845400	4847200	the nearest tavern.
4847200	4852200	There they encountered some gnomes and a small automaton, and after a brief discussion, Mo-Rein
4852200	4856480	held up the gnomes with her bow, snatching away the machine's blueprints from the helpless
4856480	4859320	gnomes, while Quark grabbed the baby bot.
4859320	4862320	But what would the gang do with the machine?
4862320	4863320	What if they got caught?
4863320	4866080	It's a fucking good episode I missed.
4866080	4872560	Would our heroes be able to escape from Bill Martigan's with their robot or their lives?
4872560	4875240	Let's find out now.
4876240	4878240	Thank you, Spencer.
4878240	4879240	Okay.
4879240	4883840	Couple gnome out over here.
4883840	4885440	Wasn't this a robot?
4885440	4886440	A baby robot.
4886440	4887440	A baby robot?
4887440	4888440	Was it in the bar?
4888440	4889440	Yeah.
4889440	4891280	And what were the blueprints that we saw?
4891280	4892920	They were for the baby robot.
4892920	4898960	There was baby blueprints, baby blueprints, baby blue, robot blueprints, rubber baby blueprints,
4898960	4903800	rubber baby robot blueprints, rubber baby robot blueprints.
4903800	4907520	And we wanted to steal these because we wanted a baby robot.
4907520	4909760	Is there a baby robot or just the blueprints to make a baby robot?
4909760	4912120	There's also a baby robot.
4912120	4916120	And so these gnomes at the bar were hanging out, and they got a baby robot.
4916120	4919120	And they have the blueprints to make another baby robot.
4919120	4923000	But then Mo-Rein held them up with her bow, and you grabbed the robot.
4923000	4925000	All right.
4925000	4927000	So I got the robot.
4927000	4928120	Describe this robot for me, please.
4928120	4931080	It looks like a gnome if it were a child.
4931080	4933080	It's maybe two and a half feet tall.
4933080	4938040	It's all silvery, and it's got empty eye sockets that are, you know, empty.
4938040	4943880	It also has a weird cavity in its chest, like something's supposed to, like, fit in there.
4943880	4947480	Well, you know what I'm going to do.
4947480	4955400	You don't got to ask me twice.
4955400	4959080	I don't fuck the baby robot's chest.
4959080	4960080	Yet.
4961080	4965080	I'm going to learn a little bit more about this baby robot.
4965080	4970080	So the gnomes kind of stand with their hands up all surrender style, and they're like,
4970080	4975080	I don't know what to do, because not to metagame, but Kumail and Aaron were, they instigated
4975080	4978080	this robbery.
4978080	4982080	I think the chapter ended with me going, what the fuck?
4982080	4986080	So now we could have maybe purchased it, or they might have just given it to us or some shit.
4986080	4988080	Well, you guys don't have any money.
4989080	4990080	Is this like Astro Boy?
4990080	4992080	Did they lose their baby and they're building a new one?
4992080	4995080	Those are great questions.
4995080	4998080	I'm going to ask them what this baby is.
4998080	5000080	I asked the, how many gnomes are in the bar?
5000080	5001080	Three.
5001080	5006080	I asked these gnomes, who is the owner of this baby robot?
5006080	5008080	Hey, Jack, Jack, take it easy.
5008080	5009080	Take it easy.
5009080	5011080	It's all going to be okay.
5011080	5015080	I'd say put the baby down.
5015080	5017080	I mean, this is me talking.
5017080	5022080	Yeah, look, I wasn't here.
5022080	5025080	So I hand the baby to you and go, do what you feel.
5025080	5028080	I've got the baby, now I'm putting it down.
5028080	5035080	I don't want to metagame, but it wasn't me that started this robbery.
5035080	5038080	You're having a quarrel of conscience with yourself.
5038080	5042080	Yeah, I never wanted to steal nothing from no one.
5042080	5046080	I was appreciating the opportunity to be between adventures.
5046080	5049080	I certainly didn't want to start a new one by robbing anybody.
5049080	5057080	And even if I did, even if I did, I wouldn't have robbed a baby.
5057080	5063080	Even in a mystical Middle Earth realm, that seems over the line.
5063080	5064080	Here's your baby.
5064080	5067080	My name is Sharpie.
5067080	5074080	I'm going to go over there and I'm going to hang out by the jukebox.
5074080	5077080	All right, I guess you give them their baby back.
5077080	5080080	They want their baby back, baby back, baby.
5080080	5084080	Fuck you.
5084080	5086080	There isn't a jukebox.
5086080	5087080	I don't exist.
5087080	5091080	Bartender, let's buy everybody here around.
5091080	5093080	You don't actually see any bartender.
5093080	5095080	These three guys are the only ones in the room.
5095080	5099080	I'd like, guys, I'd like to buy you all a drink.
5100080	5104080	For seeming like I was going to steal your baby.
5104080	5110080	I'd feel a lot better if you could get your friend to a lower bow there.
5110080	5112080	Yeah, I'll lower my bow.
5112080	5113080	Okay.
5113080	5114080	Smooth.
5114080	5119080	See, what happens is, non-known people, we have...
5119080	5123080	Do you guys know what Jack Russell Terriers are?
5123080	5124080	No.
5124080	5129080	It's like a dog that's beloved, but it's got a predilection for...
5129080	5131080	Oh, like a blink dog.
5131080	5133080	Yeah, like a blink dog.
5136080	5142080	Different breeds of man have different predilections for different obsessive behavior.
5142080	5148080	We came in here for a drink and we just freaked out for a second.
5148080	5152080	Spencer, since I'm a gnome, do I have kind of an automatic in with these guys?
5153080	5156080	Is there some affinity there, or am I still kind of a potential threat?
5156080	5160080	I feel like you guys really burned through that.
5160080	5162080	Whatever equity I had has been wasted.
5162080	5163080	Yeah.
5163080	5164080	All right.
5164080	5165080	I say, I'm sorry.
5165080	5167080	Who is the owner of this baby?
5167080	5168080	Oh, that's me.
5168080	5170080	What's your name, my friend?
5170080	5171080	Walt.
5171080	5172080	Walt?
5172080	5173080	Hey, I'm Quark.
5173080	5174080	Sorry about the whole...
5174080	5176080	Look, we've had a long day.
5176080	5180080	We just fell through Paradise and we killed the big angel thing or whatever.
5180080	5184080	Because Admiral Darkstar has been up our dick for the fucking last couple of years.
5184080	5188080	I gotta admit, it's pretty hard to connect with you guys emotionally.
5188080	5190080	Look, I understand.
5190080	5193080	We'll walk away, but we'll leave you to guys and do your thing.
5193080	5195080	I say, we just leave these guys.
5195080	5197080	We never came in here.
5197080	5198080	We never came in here.
5198080	5200080	I give them...
5200080	5201080	I give them a dollar.
5201080	5203080	I toss them my nutsack.
5203080	5206080	I have a sack of nuts, so I give them my nutsack.
5206080	5208080	Enjoy some nuts.
5208080	5209080	You know what?
5209080	5211080	I give them 50 feet of rope.
5211080	5212080	Really?
5212080	5213080	Yeah, because you never know.
5213080	5218080	As you hand them 50 feet of rope, you hear behind you several footsteps.
5218080	5220080	Several sets of footsteps.
5220080	5221080	We're gonna need that rope.
5221080	5223080	I hang onto the rope and I do one of these.
5223080	5229080	I go, if there's some motherfuckers creeping up on me, I'm keeping the rope.
5229080	5230080	That's what I do.
5230080	5233080	And it's for the trailer.
5233080	5235080	That's pretty dick, sir.
5236080	5241080	So you see behind you, three gnomes have walked in the front door.
5241080	5244080	They're looking pretty cool, cool dudes.
5244080	5248080	They're all wearing lime green scarves on their necks.
5248080	5249080	Cool.
5249080	5251080	Guys, what's up?
5251080	5254080	What are you guys doing in our turf?
5254080	5256080	Hey, here to buy you a drink?
5256080	5259080	Talk about being a gnome?
5259080	5261080	I got my gnome friend.
5261080	5264080	Hey!
5264080	5269080	We got gold, we got silver, we got stories.
5269080	5270080	Give it up!
5270080	5271080	Wait, what?
5271080	5272080	Give it up!
5272080	5273080	Give what up?
5273080	5274080	Gold, silver, stories.
5274080	5275080	Let me start over.
5275080	5278080	We got gold for our own purposes.
5278080	5280080	We have silver for our own purposes.
5280080	5281080	I don't have any gold.
5281080	5282080	Do you have any gold?
5282080	5283080	Give it up!
5283080	5285080	You're robbing us?
5285080	5288080	Yeah, you're in our turf, boys.
5288080	5290080	Some rough gnomes.
5290080	5291080	Alright, okay.
5291080	5293080	How close am I to this robot baby?
5293080	5295080	You're right up next to it.
5295080	5299080	Just grab the hole in the robot baby's chest.
5299080	5305080	It looks like it's meant to fit some sort of like, maybe like a saucer shaped...
5305080	5306080	Dick.
5306080	5307080	Yeah.
5307080	5308080	Okay.
5308080	5313080	I just want to be near that baby in case I want to grab that baby again.
5313080	5317080	I'm not going to fuck the baby, everybody.
5317080	5319080	Okay, guys, guys, guys.
5319080	5321080	I swear to God.
5322080	5328080	I promise you that if we fight, you'll lose.
5328080	5330080	Sharpie.
5330080	5337080	But if we don't fight, I will give you...
5337080	5339080	What do I have, wealth-wise?
5339080	5340080	What do I have?
5340080	5341080	I don't know.
5341080	5342080	You don't know?
5342080	5344080	I'll give you 500 million gold pieces.
5344080	5346080	I mean, I don't think you have any gold.
5346080	5347080	Oh, okay.
5347080	5349080	Guys, I will give you...
5349080	5350080	I don't have anything?
5350080	5351080	I don't think you have anything.
5351080	5354080	We always forget to loot the people that we kill.
5354080	5355080	Yeah.
5355080	5356080	All right.
5356080	5357080	Here's what I'll do.
5357080	5360080	I'm going to tell you guys a riddle.
5360080	5366080	And if you answer the riddle correctly, you can have everything that I have, okay?
5366080	5367080	Everything.
5367080	5370080	All my possessions, all my clothes, my everything.
5370080	5372080	Do you want to do the riddle?
5372080	5375080	Well, I just want to take all your stuff anyway.
5375080	5377080	You don't want to do the riddle?
5377080	5380080	Because if you don't do the riddle, we've got to fight.
5380080	5381080	Well, this...
5381080	5384080	If you do the riddle and you guess it right, you could get it without a fight.
5384080	5389080	This is Bill Martigan's, the town of cigarettes and riddles.
5389080	5392080	Yeah, so don't you want to do a riddle?
5392080	5394080	I guess I do.
5394080	5397080	All right.
5397080	5398080	All right.
5398080	5400080	So, all right.
5400080	5416080	What is smaller than a human but looks like a bloody skeleton?
5416080	5421080	Smaller than a...
5421080	5423080	The bloody skeleton of a half...
5423080	5424080	Like a fucked up...
5424080	5425080	Oh, wait.
5425080	5426080	What's all right?
5426080	5427080	I'm sorry.
5427080	5428080	I'm a skeleton of a halfling.
5428080	5431080	No, no, that's not true.
5431080	5432080	That's not right.
5432080	5433080	So, let's...
5433080	5435080	We're going to go past.
5435080	5436080	Oh.
5436080	5437080	Well, no.
5437080	5438080	Good try, though.
5438080	5439080	Wait, what?
5439080	5440080	No.
5440080	5441080	Oh, okay.
5441080	5442080	Well, you...
5442080	5443080	Give us all the stuff, man.
5443080	5444080	What's the answer to the riddle?
5444080	5445080	Oh, them!
5445080	5448080	Kick their ass!
5448080	5452080	Flaming sword, cleave attack.
5452080	5453080	Which one?
5453080	5458080	I go with the first two closest green scarf where I nose, and I go for a cleave on them
5458080	5459080	with my greatsword.
5459080	5460080	All right.
5460080	5466080	You leap towards them with a flaming greatsword with the intent to cleave, but as you do so,
5466080	5471080	the two flanking, the guy who's been talking, loose their light crossbows into your flesh.
5471080	5473080	Oh.
5473080	5476080	Light crossbows.
5476080	5480080	One of them misses, but the other does not miss, and it hits you.
5480080	5484080	Dealing some seven damage.
5484080	5490080	At any rate, you launch yourselves towards the gnomes and slash.
5490080	5496080	You slash the other one's neck, and his head pops clean off.
5496080	5498080	The other one you just hit.
5498080	5499080	Let's see how much damage you've done.
5499080	5500080	So, one guy's just done.
5500080	5501080	Yeah, he's done.
5501080	5504080	You got critical hit.
5504080	5505080	What's your damage again?
5505080	5506080	Sorry, everybody.
5506080	5507080	It is...
5507080	5508080	It's 2d8, is it?
5508080	5509080	It's 2d8 plus seven.
5509080	5514080	Oh wait, no, that was just 2d8.
5514080	5518080	It deals 11 damage to the other one, and he clutches his neck wound.
5518080	5523080	He's also got hit in the neck, because they're the same height.
5523080	5526080	And he just kind of falls down, bleeding, I guess.
5526080	5527080	He's not dead, though.
5527080	5529080	Let's put it at Mulrain's turn.
5529080	5530080	You got your bow out.
5530080	5531080	Yeah, I take out...
5531080	5536080	I have my speedy longbow, and I use that to attack one of the other gnomes.
5536080	5540080	You fire it at one of the other gnomes, like the one that was talking,
5540080	5542080	or the one that's bleeding, or the other ones.
5542080	5545080	I'll fire it at one of the ones that came in from behind.
5545080	5546080	All right.
5546080	5547080	The guy that's not hit yet.
5547080	5548080	Yeah.
5548080	5553080	You fire the arrow, but something seems to have gone wrong.
5553080	5558080	Your bowstring snaps, and the arrow just kind of flies off.
5558080	5563080	It hits you in the eye, but not the tip, like just the side of the shaft.
5563080	5567080	Hits your right in the left eye, and your bowstring snaps.
5567080	5570080	It's going to take at least a turn to heal that.
5570080	5571080	Sounds about right.
5571080	5573080	Sorry.
5575080	5578080	That one was a critical failure.
5578080	5580080	So putting it at a...
5580080	5581080	Christoperger's turn, yeah?
5581080	5586080	I pop a smoke bomb, like a ninja, for cover, and then I jump and grab the baby.
5587080	5594080	Unleashing a torrent of acrid smoke into the room, you use this cover to grab the baby.
5594080	5596080	Yeah.
5596080	5599080	What you do, now you hold it in your hands.
5599080	5601080	I'm going to hide.
5601080	5603080	You retreat into the shadows.
5603080	5605080	Oh, yeah.
5605080	5606080	He's a rogue.
5606080	5609080	You're the Steve Buscemi of this skirmish.
5610080	5612080	So that's a...
5612080	5616080	I cause fear.
5620080	5623080	That's what it'll look like if I'm successful.
5626080	5627080	All right.
5627080	5632080	So the two guys that were already in the room before you came in, they just cower in fear,
5632080	5636080	but the rest of the people aren't really affected, other than the dead guy.
5636080	5638080	All right.
5640080	5642080	They're just cowering in fear.
5642080	5644080	So the first three guys that were there, it doesn't affect you?
5644080	5645080	Yeah.
5645080	5647080	Those are the people who are already afraid.
5647080	5649080	Bleedy guy, green scarf, and non-bleedy guy, green scarf.
5649080	5650080	They're affected by it.
5650080	5651080	They weren't affected by it.
5651080	5653080	Green scarves weren't affected.
5653080	5654080	Oh, so the other guys were?
5654080	5655080	Yes.
5655080	5656080	Okay, gotcha.
5656080	5659080	These green scarves guys are so badass.
5659080	5665080	So the rest of them, the guys that are scared, they just cower normal style.
5665080	5669080	But the cactus bunch guy that's alive, he starts reloading his...
5669080	5671080	Oh yeah, I didn't even mention that.
5671080	5675080	He goes, you will not mess with the cactus bunch.
5675080	5676080	I knew it.
5676080	5678080	A guy in the front row called that.
5678080	5679080	Thank you.
5679080	5682080	That guy is the guy I'm playing this whole thing for.
5682080	5683080	I love it.
5683080	5684080	The whole reason I'm doing it.
5684080	5685080	Oh shit, you guys.
5685080	5687080	This is fucking KB.
5687080	5689080	This is the cactus bunch.
5689080	5690080	K?
5690080	5692080	They spell cactus with a K, you guys.
5692080	5693080	Two.
5693080	5695080	Two Ks as a matter of fact.
5695080	5698080	Yeah, this is fucking cactus bunch from Whittier.
5698080	5702080	You sliced this guy's head off and now we won't forget you guys.
5702080	5705080	The cactus bunches don't remember a face.
5705080	5707080	I mean, we do.
5707080	5710080	We also don't talk good.
5710080	5713080	Or spell cactus, right?
5713080	5718080	The one guy starts reloading his crossbow and the chatty guy lunges at a sharpie with
5718080	5721080	a knife drawn.
5721080	5724080	And just like that, that's how his attack goes.
5724080	5731080	He kind of just goes at you and he stabs the air next to you.
5731080	5733080	Doesn't do anything.
5733080	5736080	The rest of the guys are just scared in the corner.
5736080	5737080	Did you have a comeback?
5737080	5739080	It sounded like you had something to say.
5739080	5740080	Oh, I said sup.
5740080	5741080	Sup.
5741080	5742080	Yeah.
5742080	5743080	Not much.
5743080	5744080	Sup with you.
5744080	5745080	Well, we can just do this?
5745080	5746080	I don't know.
5746080	5748080	Why not, right?
5748080	5750080	Can we stop fighting?
5750080	5751080	Oh.
5751080	5752080	Oh.
5752080	5753080	I thought you were just talking to me.
5753080	5754080	Oh, no.
5754080	5755080	Well, whatever.
5755080	5756080	I'm talking to the guys who are trying to stab me.
5756080	5757080	It's fine.
5757080	5758080	He's fine.
5758080	5761080	Sharpie, you don't talk to KB, man.
5761080	5763080	Cactus bunches slice you.
5763080	5767080	They also take your bandana off and kick you in the chest.
5767080	5770080	Putting it at a quirk's turn.
5770080	5773080	Is my storage still flaming?
5773080	5774080	Yeah.
5774080	5775080	I come...
5775080	5777080	Where am I in relationship to the guy that's the chatty one?
5777080	5779080	The guy that came in the door.
5779080	5780080	He's behind you at this point.
5780080	5781080	He ran at Sharpie.
5781080	5785080	Is he close enough to the bleeding guy for a cleaving attack?
5785080	5786080	No, no, no.
5786080	5787080	That guy is healing himself.
5787080	5788080	He's like...
5788080	5789080	Okay.
5789080	5799080	I go up to the guy that's bleeding through the neck and I take the sword and go straight
5799080	5804080	down from his head and try to just bifurcate him, just to slice him in half.
5804080	5805080	Bifurcate him.
5805080	5806080	Hey, man.
5806080	5807080	Is my figuralization...
5807080	5809080	What was your word earlier?
5809080	5810080	General...
5810080	5811080	What was your word?
5811080	5812080	Regularization.
5812080	5813080	Regularization.
5813080	5814080	Regularization.
5814080	5815080	Thanks.
5815080	5818080	I'm going to bifurcate him.
5818080	5820080	Swinging with your sword.
5820080	5821080	Oh, shit.
5821080	5824080	You bifurcate him in two.
5824080	5827080	Oh, fuck.
5827080	5831080	That was also critical.
5831080	5833080	Wow, I'm on a roll.
5833080	5835080	I guess you are.
5835080	5840080	I need to light a cigarette and just enjoy the moments.
5840080	5843080	That's but it at a mole rain's turn.
5843080	5846080	Am I still injured from the bow injury?
5846080	5847080	No, but your bow...
5847080	5850080	You'd have to use a weapon other than your bow unless you wanted to re-strand.
5850080	5859080	Well, then I'll take my sword and attack the talky guy that hasn't been injured yet.
5859080	5863960	Grabbing your sword, you swing at the talky guy, but you miss him.
5863960	5866960	He seems to sway back with some words.
5866960	5871960	Oh, you got to swing with a different sword than that.
5871960	5873960	Oh, boy.
5873960	5876960	He's cactus butt your fucking tongue.
5876960	5879960	Yeah, putting it at Christopher's turn.
5879960	5883960	I emerge from the shadows just enough to miss my face and the creepy baby's face.
5883960	5886960	And I hold a vial of acid over the baby.
5886960	5888960	And I say, all right, motherfuckers, everybody be cool.
5888960	5891960	And I try to sound like Samuel Jackson when I do it.
5891960	5893960	And I succeed.
5893960	5894960	Oh.
5894960	5897960	Sounding like Samuel L. Jackson.
5897960	5898960	The rest of the people don't...
5898960	5899960	Tires don't fucking gnomes.
5899960	5900960	My motherfucking...
5900960	5901960	Oh, no, no, no.
5901960	5903960	If you're going to do it, commit to it.
5903960	5907960	I want to hear this Samuel L. Jackson impression.
5907960	5908960	I'll pass, I'll pass.
5908960	5910960	Oh, shit.
5910960	5912960	You were kind of doing it there.
5912960	5914960	I'm tired of these motherfucking gnomes.
5914960	5918960	My motherfucking Yomiji plane or whatever.
5918960	5921960	It's not your Yomiji plane.
5921960	5925960	So you do that, and those cowering gnomes that are all feared up,
5925960	5928960	they're all like, no, don't.
5928960	5929960	Yeah.
5929960	5930960	It works.
5930960	5935960	But the chatty gnome's like, man, I don't give a fuck.
5935960	5936960	Oh, shit.
5936960	5937960	We're like arch-on-emies.
5937960	5939960	No, we're like Pac and Biggie, that guy in there.
5939960	5940960	We're going to do it.
5940960	5944960	Also, I see you hiding.
5944960	5946960	I see you fronting.
5947960	5948960	Oh, shit.
5948960	5949960	Oh, shit.
5949960	5953960	Now it's personal.
5953960	5956960	Let's put it at a Sharpie.
5956960	5960960	Oh, this is business.
5960960	5966960	Shocking grass, motherfucker.
5966960	5970960	You grab him shockingly, but he manages to sway back
5970960	5973960	with some chatty words like, oh, man, your hand's so electric.
5973960	5975960	I don't care.
5975960	5978960	Shit.
5978960	5979960	Fuck.
5979960	5982960	He sways back, and then he lunges again towards you,
5982960	5984960	and he tries to whip his knife at your face.
5984960	5985960	Me?
5985960	5986960	Yep.
5986960	5987960	He just throws it at you, though.
5987960	5989960	Shit.
5989960	5993960	He done hit you in the face.
5993960	5996960	Dealing.
5996960	5998960	That was a critical hit, son.
5998960	6002960	Dealing, 13 damage.
6002960	6005960	I'll leave it to you to know if that means I'm dead.
6005960	6006960	Let's find out.
6006960	6008960	What's your max health?
6008960	6011960	My max health is...
6011960	6014960	I'll tell you later.
6014960	6015960	It seems irrelevant.
6015960	6017960	42?
6017960	6018960	It's 42.
6018960	6022960	Nah, you're probably at about 12 or 13.
6022960	6026960	But you stagger with your face all bled up.
6026960	6031960	Now he's disarmed, his knife's in your face.
6031960	6033960	Putting it at Quark's turn.
6033960	6036960	I run over to Sharpie, take the knife out of his face,
6036960	6040960	and plunge it in that motherfucker.
6040960	6044960	And I put it in the same spot in his face that Sharpie got.
6044960	6048960	Or you would, but you trip and fall on Sharpie's face blood
6048960	6051960	in the ground.
6051960	6054960	The knife just goes skittering out the door.
6054960	6056960	Jeff, are you doing something awesome?
6056960	6057960	Who's Jeff?
6057960	6059960	Who's Jeff?
6059960	6060960	Quark.
6060960	6063960	He's got his points.
6063960	6066960	Not today.
6066960	6070960	Can I get myself righted, or is that not my turn?
6070960	6071960	Wait, what?
6071960	6074960	Can I get myself back on my feet, or does it move on?
6074960	6075960	No, no, no.
6075960	6076960	You're out of moves.
6076960	6077960	Okay.
6077960	6078960	Putting it at Mulrane's turn.
6078960	6080960	So the knife is now out of...
6080960	6082960	Yeah, it flew out of the bar.
6082960	6083960	Okay.
6083960	6086960	So I'm going to take my Whisper bow
6086960	6089960	and hopefully be successful this time
6089960	6092960	in trying to attack the gnome that just threw the knife.
6092960	6094960	Attacking at the gnome,
6094960	6096960	you shoot him right in the throat.
6096960	6098960	Damn!
6100960	6102960	And he takes eight damage.
6102960	6103960	All right.
6103960	6106960	Choking on his own blood, he falls to the floor going,
6106960	6111960	cactus, prinkles,
6111960	6115960	stab all in the end.
6115960	6118960	Anybody get that?
6119960	6122960	That's just some cactus bunch of bullshit.
6122960	6123960	Is he dead?
6123960	6124960	Yeah.
6124960	6127960	So we got all the green scars cactus bunch, guys?
6127960	6131960	The other gnomes cower in fear still.
6131960	6135960	I know, the fight's not over though, right?
6135960	6139960	Everyone's dead except for people that are cowering in the future.
6139960	6141960	Some people would call that, yeah.
6141960	6142960	It's pretty over.
6142960	6145960	Yeah, so I hold the violet acid over the baby
6145960	6147960	and I slowly walk out towards the door.
6147960	6148960	I go, all right.
6148960	6152960	Well, I got nothing else to say.
6152960	6153960	You sure don't.
6153960	6158960	In his stead, I have a few words.
6158960	6161960	I can't see anything right now because as you can see,
6161960	6163960	and I can't,
6163960	6165960	my face has been stabbed.
6165960	6168960	But I will tell you what I can see.
6168960	6173960	I see a day when people don't fuck with each other.
6173960	6176960	Maybe I'm an old dreamer.
6176960	6179960	I know what happened here today didn't have to happen.
6179960	6180960	We got a little out of control.
6180960	6182960	We wanted to steal your baby.
6182960	6183960	We stood down.
6183960	6184960	We gave you baby back.
6184960	6187960	Some other fuckers came in, fucked with us.
6187960	6189960	Everyone's dead now.
6189960	6192960	My name's face bleeding face bleed.
6192960	6194960	Can I give you my real name?
6194960	6197960	I want you to remember me as the face bleed guy.
6197960	6198960	I can't see you.
6198960	6199960	I can't feel you.
6199960	6201960	I'll never sympathize with you.
6201960	6203960	If I ever have to hear the name of this bar again,
6203960	6206960	it burns to the ground.
6206960	6208960	For now, be content.
6208960	6212960	For it to be coated in blood.
6212960	6215960	You stab my face.
6215960	6216960	Uh, Cork?
6216960	6221960	I go over there and take their scarves.
6221960	6222960	Man, that hurt.
6222960	6225960	Oh, yeah, and I loot them.
6225960	6227960	Thank you.
6227960	6229960	Wait, what?
6230960	6233960	I go over there and take all their shit.
6233960	6234960	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6234960	6235960	Gold, everything.
6235960	6238960	I put one scarf around my head, like, like, like,
6238960	6240960	Ralph Macchio and Karate Kid.
6240960	6243960	And I put two around my leg, like, two Scott Beows.
6243960	6246960	Jesus.
6246960	6248960	And I go, you want these back.
6248960	6252960	You got to claim them from the new cactus bunch.
6252960	6253960	I'll tell you what.
6253960	6255960	I don't know if anyone's listening to me
6255960	6257960	because I can't see because my face is stabbed.
6257960	6260960	But I will tell you something that's tragically ironic
6260960	6262960	about what transpired here today.
6262960	6264960	We didn't come in here caring about finance,
6264960	6266960	to the point where we didn't have any.
6266960	6268960	These guys came in, asked for our gold.
6268960	6269960	We didn't have any.
6269960	6270960	Does that suggest anything to you?
6270960	6273960	We lived in a world without currency.
6273960	6275960	From now on, we're robbing everyone.
6275960	6282960	Uh, Mulrane, go to the gnome equivalent
6282960	6285960	of the cash register.
6285960	6287960	I can't, I got blood in my face.
6287960	6289960	I got a knife wound in my face.
6289960	6290960	I can't see anything.
6290960	6292960	I just want to rob everyone here.
6292960	6294960	If you can hear me and you're not dead,
6294960	6297960	you're lucky, but you're broke.
6297960	6301960	Mulrane, Mulrane, is there a cash register in the place?
6301960	6302960	There's money places.
6302960	6304960	Okay, so you go there.
6304960	6307960	Let's say, Krista Berg, go to the cow ring, guys,
6307960	6308960	because you're a thief.
6308960	6309960	Go get those guys.
6309960	6310960	I'll rob the dead.
6310960	6312960	On it.
6312960	6314960	Some of you are going to be left alive.
6314960	6316960	I want you to tell your friends about us.
6316960	6317960	We love money.
6317960	6319960	We love killing people.
6319960	6320960	We love robbing people.
6320960	6323960	We love money.
6323960	6326960	It's nothing new.
6326960	6329960	You'll remember it.
6329960	6331960	I ran it down just in case they forgot.
6331960	6332960	Yeah.
6332960	6335960	Well, we're going to leave it on a note here for you.
6335960	6337960	It's the same old songs.
6337960	6339960	We love money.
6339960	6341960	We love robbing people.
6341960	6342960	What do we get, Spencer?
6342960	6348960	Okay, so Mulrane in the cash till finds 300 gold pieces.
6348960	6352960	Krista Berg tries to rob these people,
6352960	6354960	but they don't seem to have very much.
6354960	6357960	You get about 17 silver.
6357960	6358960	You were robbing the dead.
6358960	6360960	I was robbing a cactus bunch.
6360960	6361960	Cactus bunch.
6361960	6362960	All of them are dead.
6362960	6364960	You already got their green bandanas,
6364960	6368960	but they also have 120 gold between the three of them,
6368960	6371960	and one of them has a strange stick
6371960	6373960	colored with yellow and red paint.
6373960	6374960	Who knows what that is?
6374960	6377960	Ooh.
6377960	6382960	He also has a card that says cactus bunch.
6382960	6383960	All right.
6383960	6385960	I go over to Sharpie.
6385960	6387960	I don't know much about looking at those sticks.
6387960	6389960	Do you feel any magic on this stick?
6389960	6392960	I got my blood is in my eyes.
6392960	6393960	Can you put it in my hand?
6393960	6394960	Yeah, put it in your hand.
6394960	6395960	All right.
6395960	6397960	I'm feeling it.
6397960	6404960	Do I have a knowledge arcana?
6404960	6405960	Come on.
6405960	6410960	You sense it arcannily, but you don't turn anything up.
6410960	6411960	All right.
6411960	6414960	It seems like a stick.
6414960	6415960	I wouldn't throw it away.
6415960	6417960	I don't think people walk around with them
6417960	6418960	unless they're valuable.
6418960	6419960	I think maybe when we...
6419960	6421960	How big is the stick?
6421960	6424960	It's maybe three inches.
6424960	6425960	It's a little stick.
6426960	6427960	All right.
6427960	6428960	So we got the stick.
6428960	6429960	We got some money.
6429960	6430960	You know where you hang on to this?
6430960	6431960	Hang on to it.
6431960	6432960	I think, you know...
6432960	6433960	Let me try.
6433960	6434960	It's a little...
6434960	6435960	Okay.
6435960	6439960	And I thrust it, and I put my magic energy into it,
6439960	6442960	and I point it at the wall.
6442960	6445960	Nothing.
6445960	6447960	I'm not going to call that a deal breaker.
6447960	6449960	I just wanted to make sure that...
6449960	6451960	Some of these things, they'll make a dinosaur.
6451960	6452960	All right.
6452960	6453960	Do we have the blueprint for the baby?
6453960	6454960	Do you guys want to pawn this?
6454960	6455960	I got the blueprint.
6455960	6456960	You got both of those things.
6456960	6458960	We got this robot baby.
6458960	6460960	We got to find out how to work that thing.
6460960	6461960	We got the blueprints.
6461960	6463960	I look at the blueprints and see if there's anything
6463960	6465960	about that disk thing, the hole in it,
6465960	6466960	and see if there's anything that...
6466960	6467960	The stick thing?
6467960	6468960	Yeah.
6468960	6471960	There's a little arrow that points to the whole cavity,
6471960	6473960	and then there's some gnomish words,
6473960	6478960	and it's all like power, power, power.
6478960	6479960	Just says power three times.
6479960	6481960	Well, what could go wrong, really?
6481960	6483960	We don't have the disk to put it in the thing.
6483960	6485960	I look around for the disk in the room to see if there's
6485960	6486960	anything to put in there.
6486960	6488960	No dice.
6488960	6489960	I mean...
6489960	6492960	Then how do you know, man?
6492960	6493960	I rolled a dice.
6493960	6495960	Three inch thing won't fit in there.
6495960	6496960	No, it's saucer shaped.
6496960	6498960	How big around is the hole in the robot baby?
6498960	6502960	Yeah, you know, like a fist shape, cup shape, size bigger
6502960	6503960	than a stick.
6503960	6504960	All right.
6504960	6508960	Can I talk to the scared gnomes and see if they can give us
6508960	6510960	information about what to put in the robot?
6510960	6512960	Yeah, they're just cowering.
6512960	6513960	Ask them whatever you want.
6513960	6514960	All right.
6514960	6516960	I'm going to ask them what we need to put in the robot.
6516960	6517960	I don't know, man.
6517960	6519960	We didn't figure that part out.
6519960	6523960	We just bought these on the gnome store.
6523960	6528960	I was going to say the internet.
6528960	6529960	All right.
6529960	6530960	We need a cliffhanger here, you guys.
6530960	6533960	Fuck.
6533960	6537960	I don't care how long it takes.
6537960	6541960	I don't care what we have to do.
6541960	6545960	You're going to get used to seeing my face with its gaping
6545960	6549960	knife wound.
6549960	6552960	You're going to give us more information than that.
6552960	6554960	Is the three inch stick on the plans at all?
6554960	6555960	Nope.
6555960	6558960	Nope.
6558960	6560960	You bought a baby.
6560960	6562960	You don't know how to power it?
6562960	6563960	No.
6563960	6564960	Why did you buy this baby?
6564960	6565960	What's the purpose?
6565960	6566960	What do these things do?
6566960	6567960	What's the purpose of these things?
6567960	6569960	They're supposed to, you know, be cool.
6569960	6573960	Like they serve drinks.
6573960	6576960	Why does it have to be a baby, then?
6576960	6578960	I mean, it's not really a...
6578960	6579960	I guess...
6579960	6580960	It's like a burpee?
6580960	6583960	It does kind of look like a baby.
6583960	6586960	So you have a little baby robot to just do stuff for you?
6586960	6588960	I don't know, man.
6588960	6590960	We're gnomes.
6590960	6591960	All right.
6591960	6592960	Well, guess what, gnomes?
6592960	6595960	Look, we're of the same breed and everything,
6595960	6596960	but we're taking that baby,
6596960	6597960	and we're going to get the hell out of here.
6597960	6600960	Well, we got it now, yeah.
6600960	6601960	Yeah!
6601960	6602960	All right.
6602960	6603960	Let's go, guys.
6603960	6605960	We walk out of the bar,
6605960	6607960	and it's the slow-mo stupid shot in every movie,
6607960	6608960	like the right stuff and everything,
6608960	6610960	and we're walking, like, down the main drag
6610960	6613960	of Bill Mardigan's, like, four breasts.
6613960	6614960	Oh, yeah.
6614960	6615960	Oh, five breasts.
6615960	6616960	We got that baby.
6616960	6617960	Is that...
6617960	6618960	Wait, no.
6618960	6619960	Is the baby working?
6619960	6620960	Is he mobile?
6620960	6621960	No, it's not turned on.
6621960	6623960	But then we slowly start running, right?
6623960	6624960	Like we look badass for a second,
6624960	6626960	but then we're going to really, really...
6626960	6627960	We're going to start running.
6627960	6628960	Right.
6628960	6630960	Because we didn't tie them up or anything.
6630960	6631960	We're going to just get out of here.
6631960	6632960	Okay, no.
6632960	6633960	We're walking away,
6633960	6636960	and we're doing the straight-to-camera walk
6636960	6637960	in slow-mo,
6637960	6638960	and then...
6638960	6639960	Is my sword still flaming?
6639960	6640960	Yeah.
6640960	6646960	I walk back and just touch the wall of the place
6646960	6647960	and go,
6648960	6651960	Burn in paradise, motherfuckers.
6656960	6657960	And then I turn to you.
6657960	6658960	You should make a...
6658960	6659960	Sharpie's making a gape-mouthed face.
6659960	6660960	You said we kill people now.
6660960	6661960	We're gang now.
6661960	6662960	Come into it.
6662960	6663960	These people helped us.
6663960	6664960	No, they didn't do shit.
6664960	6666960	They called Cactus Punch on our asses.
6666960	6667960	We tried to take their baby,
6667960	6668960	and they called it the fucking top.
6668960	6669960	Because we...
6669960	6670960	You got to harden your heart, man.
6670960	6671960	We're the gang.
6671960	6672960	We're bad people.
6672960	6673960	Well, then go put the bill...
6673960	6674960	This is a big monologue
6674960	6675960	about how we're bad guys now.
6675960	6676960	We steal and we rob.
6676960	6677960	We're trying to make them not call.
6677960	6678960	Well, now they're burning.
6678960	6679960	Should I get them out of there?
6682960	6683960	I'll get them.
6683960	6684960	I'll get them.
6684960	6685960	I go in and I get them.
6685960	6687960	Jeez, boy, mixed messages, man.
6689960	6690960	I don't think you're aware
6690960	6692960	of how good your monologues can be.
6692960	6693960	Guys, guys,
6693960	6694960	we didn't want to burn you alive.
6694960	6695960	Come on, come on.
6695960	6696960	Get out of here.
6696960	6697960	With...
6697960	6699960	Yeah, they exit.
6699960	6700960	Okay, all right.
6700960	6702960	You get out of here.
6702960	6703960	All right.
6703960	6704960	Okay.
6704960	6706960	Now, you ever tell anybody
6706960	6707960	what happened here?
6707960	6708960	Fucking skin you.
6710960	6711960	Skin your parents.
6711960	6713960	Skin your cousins.
6713960	6715960	Fucking Christmas time.
6715960	6716960	Five years from now,
6716960	6717960	you'll think everything...
6717960	6719960	There was just a weird thing that happened
6719960	6720960	that traumatized you.
6720960	6722960	Your kid will be opening a present.
6722960	6723960	I'll come out.
6728960	6729960	And I'll explain to you
6729960	6730960	what Christmas is.
6731960	6733960	And then I'll skin everybody.
6733960	6735960	So just live in terror.
6735960	6736960	A vague terror.
6736960	6737960	Not like a...
6737960	6739960	Just a vague terror.
6739960	6740960	Like, don't...
6740960	6741960	Go about your normal business.
6741960	6742960	Be happy.
6743960	6744960	Fall in love.
6744960	6745960	Have children.
6745960	6747960	But always have underneath there
6747960	6749960	like a meta-channel of terror.
6750960	6752960	Like, the idea that I would come.
6752960	6753960	Like, I would be there
6753960	6754960	and I would hurt you.
6754960	6755960	Okay, all right, good.
6755960	6757960	And then I think we always...
6757960	6758960	Then we start running away.
6758960	6759960	Now we're cool.
6759960	6760960	Now we're cool.
6760960	6762960	Because I noticed that
6762960	6764960	in that building there was alcohol
6764960	6765960	and stuff like that.
6765960	6766960	And it's gonna blow up
6766960	6767960	in a pretty spectacular fashion.
6767960	6768960	They're fine now.
6768960	6769960	They're fine.
6769960	6770960	Get clear of the...
6770960	6772960	There's alcohol that's gonna blow up.
6773960	6774960	The gnomes run off
6774960	6776960	with vague terror in their hearts.
6780960	6781960	And then we're running away.
6781960	6783960	And the thing is starting to...
6783960	6784960	The building is fully...
6784960	6785960	Like, it's on fire?
6785960	6786960	Like, is it fully...
6786960	6787960	Oh yeah, it's all caught up.
6787960	6788960	Yeah.
6788960	6789960	On fire.
6790960	6791960	All right.
6791960	6792960	And then it...
6792960	6793960	And then it blows up.
6793960	6794960	Hey!
6799960	6800960	All right.
6800960	6801960	Wrong song.
6801960	6802960	There we go.
6802960	6803960	Private John, everybody.
6803960	6804960	Thank you for coming so much.
6804960	6805960	Thank you, Eric.
6805960	6807960	Let's thank Laura and Eric.
6810960	6811960	Good job.
6812960	6815960	Laura, for saving the day
6815960	6816960	and the D&D and Eric,
6816960	6818960	for saving our love of Superman.
6819960	6820960	Thank you, Spencer Crinden.
