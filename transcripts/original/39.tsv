0	19680	Hello, Denver, Colorado!
19680	26520	You lucky, lucky sons of bitches, Permit Town is in session!
26520	28040	I'm sorry about those sons of bitches, though.
28040	30040	You guys seem pretty nice.
30040	31040	Welcome to the stage.
31040	39040	I want you to please, the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman!
39040	49040	Yo, yo, ho, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
49040	56040	Denver Town, city on a mountain, bussies blowing, sorry, bussies like fountains, sorry.
56040	60040	Bussies like a river, I'm an orgasm giver, sorry.
60040	63040	I'm already getting pretty gross.
63040	66040	Sorry about that, Denver, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
66040	67040	Pussy.
67040	68040	Sorry.
68040	69040	All right.
69040	71040	I fucked your mama.
71040	74040	Wow, you came right out the gate.
74040	78040	I said city on a mountain because I was thinking about the elevation here.
78040	81040	And then it was like fountain, rhymes with mountain.
81040	86040	And then it was like, but the unfortunate dot connection between pussy and fountain,
86040	90040	that makes you think of all kinds of weird stuff.
90040	92040	I don't want it to be that kind of show.
92040	94040	I'm worried about you if you do a lot of rapping.
94040	96040	I mean, I want you to do a lot of rapping tonight.
96040	99040	I want you to do your little toddler dance, but at this elevation.
99040	103040	It is, yeah, I wonder if there's a thing here.
103040	105040	You know, we're exactly a mile above sea level.
105040	108040	Exactly, exactly a mile above sea level.
108040	112040	5,280 feet or your money back.
112040	117040	And I swear, last time I was in Denver, yeah, I could feel the effects of it,
117040	119040	like being at this altitude.
119040	122040	You're worried I'm going to die because I'm going to be dancing around.
122040	123040	No, I'm worried.
123040	124040	You're not going to die.
124040	126040	You're just going to pass out.
126040	128040	And the audience will be concerned.
128040	130040	Are you here by yourself?
130040	132040	Oh, what's your name?
132040	134040	I don't want to pick on you.
134040	135040	My name's Ryan.
135040	136040	Hey, Ryan.
136040	138040	Anybody else alone?
138040	140040	You are?
140040	143040	We got three down front.
143040	144040	Oh, all right.
144040	145040	Oh, really?
145040	147040	Well, that seems like a shitty seat.
147040	153040	Do you want to sit where Ryan's table?
153040	157040	Hey, it's called Harbin Town, not Denver Improv Town.
157040	160040	They can absolutely suck it.
160040	161040	Yeah, they can't really.
161040	162040	What's your name?
162040	163040	What's your name, sir?
163040	164040	I'll pay them a lot of money.
164040	165040	I'll write them a check.
165040	167040	If you want to sit there, sit there.
167040	168040	So we got Drew.
168040	169040	Drew just moved down.
169040	170040	We're rearranging.
170040	172040	So now Drew and Ryan are sitting together.
172040	173040	All right.
173040	175040	And then that guy that looks exactly like Steven Schraub.
175040	176040	Okay, wow.
176040	180040	Ryan, I hope you wanted the company because now...
180040	181040	Yeah.
181040	183040	A table of one is a table for four now.
183040	184040	I love that.
184040	189040	And a finder's fee.
189040	191040	Cheese dick snurfer.
191040	193040	Oh, he's a cheese dick snurfer.
193040	199040	He'll grab a hold of your cheese dicks.
199040	202040	Cheese like no other.
202040	207040	He'll sit for people down to eat their cheese.
207040	210040	He's the kind of guy that loves cheese.
210040	213040	Loves it right between knees.
213040	214040	Stump.
214040	215040	Stupid.
215040	217040	And not legally clearable either.
217040	218040	Stupid.
218040	222040	No, I don't think anybody would sue you for doing that to that song.
222040	223040	All right.
223040	225040	What are the names here we got?
225040	226040	I'm Steven.
226040	227040	Steven.
227040	228040	Drew.
228040	229040	Drew.
229040	230040	Ryan again.
230040	231040	Adam.
231040	232040	Adam.
232040	233040	Try to remember that.
233040	236040	Could one of you be named Danfro or something?
236040	238040	Steven, Drew, Ryan, Adam, right?
238040	239040	All right.
239040	241040	The Council of Doom.
241040	242040	Yeah.
242040	245040	That is going to make it hard for me to get out there and work the crowd.
245040	247040	And if there's a fire, we're all going to die.
247040	248040	Steven.
248040	251040	Steven, you sitting this close to the stage,
251040	254040	there's going to be some hot beard on beard action when Spencer comes out.
254040	257040	Let's get these beards together right now.
266040	269040	Beard on beard.
269040	270040	What's his name?
270040	271040	God damn it.
271040	272040	Steven, Drew.
272040	275040	Andrew, John, Steve, Ryan,
275040	280040	John, Jason, Adam, Bob, and Tim.
281040	284040	Jess, we need more creative parents in this world.
284040	288040	Speaking as a Dan, like, like, like, like, we got to, we got to...
288040	290040	Steven James Ross is the wockiest fucking name ever.
290040	291040	Yeah.
291040	293040	How about Jeffrey Brian Davis?
293040	295040	That's pretty white.
297040	298040	God damn it.
298040	302040	I wish people's names were like, yeah, I mean, I've said this before.
302040	306040	Like, I want, you know, you should have, like, you should, you should, like,
306040	309040	for the first 11 years of your life, you should just be called Kid, or, like,
310040	312040	because who gives a shit about you?
312040	314040	Like, what do you, what do you, what do you know?
314040	315040	You don't know nothing.
315040	316040	It's just a kid.
316040	318040	It's kid number eight, kid number nine.
318040	321040	And then, like, on your 12th birthday,
321040	324040	you should either pick your name or have everybody give you a name.
324040	328040	And it's like, if you're an asshole, it should be, your name should be Asshole.
328040	332040	Or if you're, like, into Eagles, they could call you Eagle, you know?
332040	333040	I don't care.
333040	334040	I just want it to be specific.
334040	336040	What if you're into Eagles Assholes?
336040	337040	Yeah, exactly.
338040	341040	That's exactly, I want to, like, we've got to fix society, Jeff.
341040	343040	We've got to go to the moon, and we've got to call in.
343040	347040	I think, but just your natural instinct, there was a man sitting here alone,
347040	350040	but we found out that there's lots of singles here tonight.
350040	352040	It's not a surprise with my crowd.
352040	356040	It's a, it's just not, it's just not a couple's show.
356040	359040	I guess, I'd be more surprised if there was lots of single ladies here.
359040	361040	Yeah, yeah, that would be a weird thing.
361040	363040	Whoo, bachelorette party.
365040	366040	Yeah.
368040	370040	I'm sorry, my beard is getting really long on the road,
370040	372040	and so it's absorbing a lot of vodka.
373040	375040	I don't know what to talk about, I want not to talk about,
375040	381040	we'll edit it out if it's not fruitful, but really, save it for later.
381040	383040	You mean the topic or the vodka?
383040	385040	You mean the vodka.
385040	388040	It's one of the ladies that came here to hook up.
389040	396040	Okay, so John, Jake, Ryan, Tim, Steve, Andrew, and Bob.
396040	397040	Okay.
397040	398040	Adam.
398040	400040	All right, we'll have you guys up later.
401040	403040	Jeff, you're back.
403040	405040	You were gone for two episodes.
405040	406040	I am.
407040	408040	Thank you very much.
408040	410040	I had to leave Harmanstown.
410040	412040	Sadly, it was weird to be away from you guys for two days.
412040	415040	I went and joined Ryan Styles and Greg Proops and Joel Murray in the Northwest,
415040	417040	and we did three shows.
417040	420040	You guys had a day off, you guys went to the shittiest places in the world.
421040	425040	I leave the group for two days, and they are at Dave & Buster's.
427040	432040	It's possible that you may be the force that brings us to more exquisite places,
432040	438040	but it's also possible that in Kansas City, the hotel was next to one of these malls
438040	442040	where there's just like a dinosaur restaurant and then the stand-up club we were performing at,
442040	446040	and it was like Dave Coulier's there on Wednesday and J.J. Walker's there on Friday,
446040	452040	and then it said like John Davis and Dan Herman in their nationally televised podcast.
452040	454040	You could be in the show.
454040	455040	That's what it said.
457040	459040	I didn't know that we were televising this.
459040	462040	We are safely away from Kansas City,
462040	465040	and the people that came to that show, the 60 Armenians in that audience,
465040	471040	I want to say I love you very much, but that club sucked.
471040	472040	That was bad news.
472040	475040	It was like being in a driver's ed class like in the back of a mall.
475040	477040	It was not made for us.
477040	479040	It was not made for our people.
479040	482040	The people that did show up were bummed out, and I think it affects me.
482040	483040	I don't know.
483040	485040	Do you think I'm having a good show right now, Jeff?
485040	486040	We're not talking about anything.
486040	487040	What am I doing?
487040	490040	Let's make with the entertainment!
492040	494040	Entertainment section.
494040	496040	Entertainment section.
496040	498040	Entertainment section.
498040	500040	She's about to entertain your balls off right now.
500040	503040	Welcome to the entertainment section.
503040	505040	I fucked your mama up, he has rhyme erection.
505040	507040	I fucked your answer today and last week.
507040	509040	I fucked your mama so hard she went to the widow's peak.
509040	511040	It's a special place.
511040	513040	Nick Nolte lives there.
513040	515040	It's named after him because of his hair.
515040	517040	His hair is a widow's peak.
517040	519040	I don't need to explain myself.
519040	520040	See you next week.
520040	522040	I fucked your mama on a hill in a valley.
522040	524040	I fucked your mama to tell her name with Sally.
524040	526040	Fourth right.
526040	527040	Wasn't that a comic?
527040	530040	I fucked your mama on a comet.
530040	532040	I fucked your mama in Denver.
532040	534040	I fucked your mama and she doesn't remember.
534040	535040	It's not my fault.
535040	536040	It wasn't great.
536040	538040	I didn't put anything in her drink.
538040	539040	It was great.
539040	540040	She had a good time.
540040	542040	Her damn leisure was brought on by my dick.
542040	544040	Oh, my dick.
549040	551040	The altitude, Jeff, is...
551040	553040	I can't rap at this altitude.
553040	554040	Don't blame the altitude.
554040	555040	I can't rap at this altitude.
555040	556040	Don't blame the cheese dick.
556040	559040	We gotta be a mile above sea level right now.
559040	561040	We are exactly, exactly one mile above.
561040	564040	This is the place to be when the polar ice caps melt.
564040	566040	Like, this is gonna be the last place.
566040	567040	This is dry land, right?
567040	569040	This is where the, uh...
569040	570040	Oh, fuck.
570040	572040	This altitude.
574040	576040	You know who's really good at rapping?
576040	577040	Huh?
577040	578040	I mean, a lot of people.
578040	579040	A lot of professional people that get paid for it.
579040	580040	Yeah.
580040	582040	Dr. Dre?
582040	583040	Spencer.
583040	585040	We found out on the bus last night.
587040	589040	Do we get Spencer up here?
589040	591040	Spencer.
591040	594040	He's very concerned about being put on the spot about his rapping.
594040	596040	But the truth is, in...
596040	598040	Spencer, everybody.
599040	600040	Spencer Crittenden.
600040	602040	The Dungeon Master.
605040	607040	I don't know if you guys are avid podcast listeners.
607040	609040	I assume you bought tickets on that.
610040	613040	You may recall that back in Los Angeles,
613040	616040	when we decided to bring...
616040	617040	That's Raquel.
617040	618040	Make sure you tip her.
618040	620040	And I don't know everyone's name,
620040	621040	but I'm gonna be...
621040	622040	I thought that would be impressive if I did that.
622040	623040	What's your name right there?
623040	624040	What's your name?
626040	627040	Maria.
627040	628040	Yeah, don't tip her.
629040	631040	She's working...
631040	632040	No, she's working at the same tables as Raquel.
632040	633040	Raquel doesn't know why she's here.
633040	635040	Never met her in her life.
635040	637040	She's just following Raquel around,
637040	640040	taking drinks away that Raquel puts down.
640040	642040	Maria was fired from this place 15 years ago.
642040	643040	Yeah.
643040	645040	Yeah, Maria...
645040	646040	Some say she died here.
646040	647040	Yeah.
648040	649040	From a certain angle,
649040	651040	you can still see her haunting other waitresses.
651040	652040	Yeah.
653040	655040	Yeah, there's a photo of Domerara on the wall
655040	657040	and Maria's in the background,
657040	660040	which is weird because Domerara was famous in the 20s.
662040	663040	Shining.
664040	665040	So, Dan...
665040	666040	Wait, what was I talking about?
666040	668040	Well, I'll get you back on check.
668040	669040	I went away for a while.
669040	670040	I didn't...
670040	671040	I haven't heard Minneapolis
671040	673040	because I didn't get a chance to listen to it.
673040	674040	And Kansas City hasn't dropped yet,
674040	676040	so I haven't heard that one either.
676040	678040	So I don't really know what went on.
678040	681040	I heard that you had the basic upshot
681040	683040	on what the shows were.
683040	686040	Spencer filled me in on the D&D campaign.
686040	687040	But story structure-wise,
687040	689040	there was this thing that you put on Tumblr
689040	690040	about the fact that you felt like,
690040	692040	if you're the hero of the story,
692040	694040	the fact that you haven't changed at all.
694040	695040	Right.
695040	696040	Did you discuss this in the show?
696040	697040	I talked about it a little bit.
697040	698040	It was Kansas City.
698040	700040	They're kind of right over their heads.
700040	701040	This is the time to talk about it.
701040	703040	Nothing gets over the heads in Denver.
703040	705040	They're a mile above sea level.
706040	709040	You did this really fascinating little video on Tumblr.
709040	710040	It was amazing because you didn't edit it.
710040	711040	It was really like...
711040	712040	You didn't stutter once.
712040	713040	It was really like...
713040	714040	It was really good.
714040	715040	Second take.
715040	716040	Second take.
716040	717040	Second take.
717040	718040	It was really?
718040	719040	Well, that's nice of you to be honest about that.
719040	720040	Uh...
720040	723040	Burt.
723040	724040	Sorry.
724040	725040	It's the altitude.
725040	726040	The altitude.
726040	727040	What has happened?
727040	728040	Are you like John Hurt and Alien,
728040	730040	or are we going to find out that the two...
730040	733040	How are your two days off-planet?
733040	734040	It was great.
734040	735040	It was great.
735040	736040	Let's have some more breakfast.
736040	737040	Brrrrr.
737040	738040	Brrr.
738040	740040	So you're saying story structure-wise,
740040	742040	if you're the hero of this tour that you're going on,
742040	743040	the fact that you haven't changed
743040	744040	probably makes you the villain.
744040	745040	Possibly, yeah.
745040	746040	Possibly makes you the villain.
746040	747040	Certainly makes me like at least an extra
747040	749040	or like a horse.
749040	753040	But Spencer released this beautifully written blog
753040	757040	about his awakening or his...
757040	759040	He's really just self-examination.
759040	760040	He's going on a journey.
760040	762040	He's on a journey.
762040	764040	He's meeting the outside world.
764040	766040	He's coming to grips with other people
766040	767040	and what that means about him.
767040	770040	Spencer learned on this journey
770040	774040	that everyone in the world could be into him
774040	776040	but no one would ever understand him.
776040	777040	I'm not putting words in...
777040	778040	That sounds pretentious,
778040	779040	putting words in his mouth like that,
779040	783040	but that's like he learned...
783040	784040	Is that about right, Spencer?
784040	786040	I wouldn't phrase it that way.
786040	787040	No, it sounds...
787040	789040	That would make you sound like a dick, yeah.
789040	792040	But you got to a point where it's like
792040	796040	people were throwing the equivalent of panties at you.
796040	798040	That was a wool cap.
798040	799040	There were dudes throwing wool caps at you.
799040	802040	That's as close as this crowd's going to get
802040	803040	to throwing panties.
803040	805040	This crowd is a practical crowd.
805040	808040	If they have panties, they're using them.
808040	812040	A hipster threw his wool cap at you and said,
812040	814040	I don't need this anymore.
814040	816040	You take it.
816040	820040	And then even though that seems like a thing,
820040	822040	it's like, oh, I would like that.
822040	824040	I would like to be able to push a button
824040	826040	and feel what it's like to feel everyone liking me,
826040	829040	everyone appreciating me, everyone accepting me.
829040	833040	And you said in your blog entry, to paraphrase you,
833040	835040	to extrapolate what you were saying,
835040	839040	that the arrival at that goal actually led you
839040	843040	to the realization that there will still never be
843040	847040	a certain connection between you and other people.
847040	850040	You could be alone for the rest of your life, Spencer.
850040	851040	I will be.
851040	853040	I mean, that's a given.
854040	856040	So this motherfucker's on a journey.
856040	858040	I'm just a fat guy on a bus.
858040	862040	So we're going to find out that he's the hero of this.
862040	864040	And that makes me like Jafar.
866040	868040	I didn't mean to say it like Christopher Walken.
868040	869040	It's Jafar.
869040	871040	That makes me like Jafar.
871040	874040	To his Aladdin.
874040	878040	My story circle is crystal ball.
878040	880040	But now you're doing Jimmy Stewart.
880040	883040	I'm also Bane from Batman.
884040	888040	Many people talk like this, Jaf.
889040	891040	Jimmy Stewart.
891040	893040	Garrison Keeler.
893040	895040	Bane.
895040	898040	Christopher Walken.
898040	900040	Bill Clinton.
900040	903040	Don Nutz.
903040	905040	Popeye.
905040	907040	Can we hear your Don Nutz?
907040	911040	Well, Michael.
911040	913040	Bill Clinton.
913040	916040	I think you should run for president.
916040	917040	Oh, thank you.
917040	919040	I don't have relations with a woman.
919040	920040	I'm Don Nutz.
920040	921040	Bill Clinton.
921040	922040	Bill Clinton.
922040	924040	Can I get a little Bill Cosby in there?
924040	928040	What are you two talking about over here?
928040	933040	I got Don Nutz and Bill Clinton talking to me.
933040	935040	I'm not talking to you.
935040	938040	I'm not talking to Bill Clinton.
938040	940040	I'm not talking to you either.
940040	942040	I'm talking to Bill Clinton.
942040	944040	Oh, oh, Gabby Hayes just walked in.
944040	947040	Yeah, well, well, Michael.
947040	948040	I'm Bill Clinton.
948040	950040	I'm Gabby Hayes.
950040	951040	I'm Don Nutz.
951040	953040	I'm Bill Cosby.
956040	959040	No, no, no, no.
959040	961040	Don't embarrass your sons.
961040	963040	It was not full of applause.
963040	965040	It was giant pockets of no applause.
965040	966040	Good.
966040	967040	Those people are heroes.
967040	969040	There's people who are like, no, no.
969040	970040	Swing and a miss.
970040	972040	There will be times when I will appreciate effort from you
972040	974040	when I will need it.
974040	977040	But there are also times when I need to be punished.
977040	979040	So if you feel like story structure wise,
979040	981040	because we obsess over this, that last night
981040	983040	was some sort of death because of the room you were in
983040	986040	and the whole thing.
986040	990040	You also found out on the tour bus, driving here overnight,
990040	992040	that Spencer's been a rapper.
992040	994040	Spencer can rap better than you.
994040	995040	Yeah.
995040	996040	That's not true.
996040	1000040	Well, spoken like a hero.
1000040	1003040	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
1003040	1004040	Don't turn around.
1004040	1006040	Yo, don't turn around.
1006040	1009040	Just behind you, always behind you.
1009040	1012040	No matter where you look, I'm always going to be behind you.
1012040	1014040	He just took his dick out of his pants right now.
1014040	1017040	I'm going to find you, flicking in the trees.
1017040	1019040	I'm going behind you.
1019040	1020040	What's your name?
1020040	1021040	Jason.
1021040	1024040	I fucked your mama so hard her pussy started to hasten.
1024040	1026040	So it got really fast.
1026040	1030040	I fucked your mama so hard her pussy started to blast off
1030040	1033040	from the tarmac in space.
1033040	1036040	I fucked your mama regardless of her race.
1036040	1039040	She's biracial.
1039040	1040040	I fucked your mama.
1040040	1045040	It was spatial relations that I needed.
1045040	1049040	I put my dick down and she heeded the call
1049040	1051040	to adventure of my wiener.
1051040	1055040	She came to it and said, this looks leaner than bacon.
1055040	1056040	Put it on her plate.
1056040	1059040	I fucked your mama hard because I'm not about hate.
1059040	1063040	Yo, come on down to Harman Town.
1063040	1066040	Turn that frown upside down.
1066040	1069040	Diversity is yellow poop is brown.
1069040	1072040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1072040	1076040	Yo, I'm going to do another verse so that Spencer can do one
1076040	1077040	that couldn't be worse.
1077040	1081040	I'm going to lower the bar and talk to my people.
1081040	1082040	What's your name?
1082040	1083040	Andy.
1083040	1085040	Steeple.
1085040	1086040	See how that works?
1086040	1088040	It didn't matter what his name was.
1088040	1090040	I'm a fucking jerk.
1090040	1091040	I just rap.
1091040	1092040	I work in the crowd.
1092040	1094040	I'm going to eat your fry.
1094040	1096040	I'm going to tell you not loud enough.
1096040	1099040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1099040	1102040	Turn that frown upside down.
1102040	1105040	Peas yellow poop is brown.
1105040	1108040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1108040	1109040	You know, I'm Spencer.
1109040	1110040	I'm the dungeon master.
1110040	1113040	If you mess with me, it's going to be a huge disaster
1113040	1116040	because I'm six foot four and I pack a bunch.
1116040	1119040	But bitch, don't be asking what I had for lunch
1119040	1122040	because I'll tie you up with ropes and chains.
1122040	1125040	And when we play in D&D, you know I'll hold the reins
1125040	1128040	because with a lightning bolt or a fireball,
1128040	1131040	you best roll a climb check before you climb that wall.
1131040	1132040	Oh, shit.
1132040	1135040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1135040	1138040	Turn that frown upside down.
1138040	1139040	Hero.
1139040	1141040	Peas yellow poop is brown.
1141040	1142040	Death.
1142040	1144040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1144040	1146040	As I get older, my brain starts to sag.
1146040	1149040	I look over at Spencer and turn into a dish rag.
1149040	1153040	I'm melting to the earth and my brain doesn't work.
1153040	1155040	I remember the thing with the steeple
1155040	1156040	and then I said I was a jerk.
1156040	1158040	It doesn't matter if you have to say it.
1158040	1161040	And no matter how much you admit, it doesn't change it.
1161040	1164040	I'm weak, my synapses get farther apart.
1164040	1168040	And every time I open my lips, what comes out is a mental fart.
1168040	1171040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1171040	1174040	Turn that frown upside down.
1174040	1175040	Old.
1175040	1177040	Peas yellow poop is brown.
1177040	1178040	Dead.
1178040	1180040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1180040	1181040	I'll take the mic.
1181040	1182040	I'll get the mic back.
1182040	1185040	Wait, let me see if I can put things back on track.
1185040	1186040	I said I'm Spencer.
1186040	1188040	I'm a dungeon master.
1188040	1191040	And you can hear me preach, but man, I ain't no pastor.
1191040	1194040	If you try and keep up, man, I will run faster.
1194040	1197040	It comes a long last and I'm the long blaster.
1197040	1200040	I can't get a yellow with my master blaster.
1200040	1203040	I can't think of another thing that rhymes with aster.
1203040	1207040	Oh, come on down to Harman Town.
1207040	1210040	Spencer, turn that frown upside down.
1210040	1211040	Roll.
1211040	1213040	Peas yellow poop is brown.
1213040	1214040	Hit point.
1214040	1216040	Come on down to Harman Town.
1216040	1218040	I'm a class in the skies from the sky.
1218040	1221040	I want to swing my sword, but I don't know why.
1221040	1224040	I got a beard, the length of the whole Mississippi.
1224040	1227040	Fuck your mama so hard that her pussy got drippy.
1227040	1228040	I'm sorry.
1228040	1230040	I'm so sorry about my shit.
1230040	1234040	I'm misogynist and I go to weird places when I start to throw a bit.
1234040	1236040	I can't do anything else.
1236040	1240040	I'm infantile and I just belong on a really old shelf.
1240040	1242040	Got fired from NBC.
1242040	1245040	Came out on the road, said, hey, look at me.
1245040	1247040	It's $20 a ticket.
1247040	1248040	Don't know why.
1248040	1250040	Don't have an act.
1250040	1251040	I'm just a guy.
1251040	1253040	I'm just a big fat asshole.
1253040	1255040	Staking your cheese sticks.
1255040	1258040	Talking about your mama loving my dick.
1258040	1261040	Come down to Harman Town.
1261040	1264040	Turn that frown upside down.
1264040	1265040	Rap.
1265040	1267040	Peas yellow poop is brown.
1267040	1268040	Rhymin.
1268040	1270040	Come down to Harman Town.
1270040	1271040	Oh, yeah, shit.
1271040	1273040	I didn't know I was going to have to rap now, but I will,
1273040	1274040	because I was on the road.
1274040	1277040	And I tried to kill the audience when I was away in Seattle,
1277040	1279040	but now there's a rap battle.
1279040	1282040	And I know that Spencer is the man who's rising taller in the saddle.
1282040	1283040	He sits high.
1283040	1284040	His beard's hanging low.
1284040	1286040	Dan's up there.
1286040	1287040	How long he lasts?
1287040	1288040	I don't know.
1288040	1289040	The altitude's so high.
1289040	1291040	He's a kind of overweight guy.
1291040	1293040	He had so much kenzle vodka last day.
1293040	1294040	I think he might die.
1294040	1297040	Oh, come on now to Harman Town.
1297040	1298040	Pick up.
1298040	1300040	Tip-top.
1300040	1301040	Tip-top.
1301040	1303040	Down to Harman Town.
1303040	1304040	Slip-slop.
1304040	1306040	Down to Harman Town.
1306040	1308040	Yeah, that's fucking how you do it.
1308040	1309040	All right.
1309040	1312040	That was nice.
1312040	1313040	Good job, Spencer.
1313040	1314040	Thanks, guys.
1314040	1315040	Thanks.
1315040	1318040	You broke your cherry, Spencer.
1318040	1319040	You broke your cherry.
1319040	1321040	You did good.
1321040	1324040	That's a reference over my head.
1324040	1325040	It's not really a reference.
1325040	1326040	We're just...
1326040	1327040	I'm like, good fellas.
1327040	1330040	Hey, you broke your cherry.
1330040	1331040	It's $500.
1331040	1334040	You got pinched and you didn't schlamootz.
1334040	1337040	You didn't schlamootz.
1337040	1338040	Yes.
1338040	1339040	Yes.
1339040	1342040	No, no, no, sorry.
1342040	1344040	I don't know what it is about this.
1344040	1345040	It's the altitude.
1345040	1346040	It's not the altitude.
1346040	1347040	It is the altitude.
1347040	1349040	It's your elation that I'm back with you.
1349040	1350040	That's true.
1350040	1352040	I'm very glad to have you back.
1352040	1354040	I thought Aaron did a great job.
1354040	1358040	Minneapolis, I put up on it because it was a very fun show.
1358040	1359040	Warts and all.
1359040	1365040	There was some asshole in the crowd that was like, hey, your relationship is boring.
1365040	1368040	And then we attacked him.
1368040	1369040	I found myself...
1369040	1370040	I listened to the recording.
1370040	1373040	I was like, okay, here's the mistakes I made.
1373040	1377040	This guy piped up in the audience and instead of saying what I always say, which is, oh,
1377040	1380040	hey, you have something to say, do you want to come up and talk to us?
1380040	1382040	Would you be willing to come up and talk to us if we don't bully anybody?
1382040	1386040	You hear in that record, which is like, get up here, you fucking asshole.
1386040	1388040	It just turned into this thing.
1388040	1391040	We hit this weird rock bottom thing where it was like...
1391040	1393040	And then people were just yelling out like, fuck you.
1393040	1394040	Fuck potatoes.
1394040	1395040	They would go, what'd you say?
1395040	1396040	I said, fuck potatoes.
1396040	1397040	All right, fuck potatoes.
1397040	1398040	Come up here.
1398040	1399040	Why'd you say fuck potatoes?
1399040	1401040	Because I wanted to be on stage.
1401040	1403040	And then I just got mad.
1403040	1404040	And I fucking...
1404040	1407040	I shut the whole thing down.
1407040	1409040	I fucking axel...
1409040	1410040	Axel...
1410040	1411040	Axel...
1412040	1415040	I threw a camera and I put my wiener in a shoe.
1415040	1420040	And then I took the shoe and I wore it like a hat, but my wiener was still in it.
1420040	1423040	So it wasn't disconnected.
1423040	1426040	It was like stretched.
1426040	1428040	And then I...
1428040	1430040	You axle-roasted.
1430040	1431040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1431040	1439040	And I held the top of the hat and I played my own thread-stretched penis.
1440040	1441040	Like a banjo.
1441040	1442040	Like a gun bucket.
1442040	1445040	A lot of people certainly don't know what I mean when I say axle-rose.
1445040	1446040	I just need to clarify.
1446040	1447040	That's what I did.
1447040	1450040	I made a cigar box guitar out of my own deck.
1450040	1452040	You're describing an axle-rose.
1452040	1453040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1453040	1458040	No, I know, but there's a lot good 40% of the people here don't know what that means.
1458040	1465040	I made a weird southern instrument out of my mutilated penis.
1465040	1468040	And blamed security.
1470040	1473040	We're in the home stretch.
1473040	1475040	I feel weird, Jeff.
1475040	1476040	I don't know what to...
1476040	1477040	It's the altitude.
1477040	1478040	It's the altitude.
1478040	1479040	I understand.
1479040	1480040	All right.
1480040	1482040	Jeff, can you just...
1482040	1484040	Can you control me?
1484040	1485040	I'll try, man.
1485040	1486040	Just help me out.
1486040	1487040	I can't look at them.
1487040	1488040	I can't look at them.
1488040	1490040	Well, I think there's a moment...
1490040	1493040	I left for a while and it was very strange and I came back and I was like,
1493040	1494040	I missed you guys and...
1494040	1495040	Something happened to us.
1495040	1498040	We only have a few days left.
1498040	1501040	And we're going back to some of my favorite cities.
1501040	1504040	Well, not Salt Lake, but...
1505040	1506040	Salt Lake.
1506040	1509040	It's the Paris of salty lakes.
1509040	1516040	I mean, honestly, if you're gonna have salt, don't put a lake there and vice versa.
1516040	1517040	We've heard it before.
1517040	1520040	It just seems like a dumb place to have salt.
1520040	1522040	It's a lake.
1522040	1525040	It's gonna be cold as hell there, right?
1525040	1526040	Really?
1526040	1532040	I want to go out to the Salt Lake flats and reenact every Playboy video I've ever seen growing up.
1532040	1536040	It seemed like they were always out in these flats.
1536040	1541040	Every Playboy playmate video centerfold would...
1541040	1544040	They'd just be naked out in the salt flats.
1544040	1545040	No?
1545040	1547040	I'm not familiar with that one.
1547040	1548040	All right.
1548040	1551040	Well, then I'm eating another one of Toby's cheese sticks.
1552040	1554040	His name's Adam.
1555040	1558040	He should have thought of that before he ordered cheese sticks.
1558040	1562040	So, probably a few days ago, but certainly as of Denver, Colorado.
1562040	1564040	The diet is just out the goddamn window.
1564040	1566040	Oh, yeah, for sure.
1571040	1573040	Do you think you've gained a significant amount of weight in this trip?
1573040	1575040	Yeah, I'm Vince Vaughn.
1579040	1580040	I can't stop myself, Jeff.
1580040	1584040	I came back to the hotel and I ran into Dustin Marshall.
1584040	1587040	Also, Dustin Marshall, our podcast producer, is back there.
1587040	1589040	He's a good kid.
1589040	1590040	He's a great dude.
1590040	1591040	He's a good kid.
1591040	1593040	Largely unsung, I think.
1593040	1597040	He dwells in the shadows, but he's the reason why you guys get to hear this almost every night,
1597040	1599040	and it's his hard work.
1599040	1601040	So, thank you, Dustin.
1601040	1605040	Yeah, he's a good dude, and he's just been smashing pussy on this trip.
1605040	1609040	I'm kidding. I'm joking.
1609040	1611040	He's into dudes.
1613040	1614040	I ran into him.
1614040	1616040	He's like, oh, I'm going to Dan and Aaron's hotel room right now,
1616040	1618040	and they're going to do a This Feels Terrible podcast.
1618040	1620040	They're going to stop by and say, hey, I'm like, yeah, I pop in there.
1620040	1622040	You guys have been there just today, right?
1622040	1623040	Yeah.
1623040	1625040	It looked like a fucking city dump in there, man.
1625040	1629040	There was shit everywhere just food.
1629040	1631040	You guys really got it on today.
1632040	1636040	I was recuperating from this late night party bus thing that we did.
1636040	1637040	It doesn't matter.
1637040	1639040	Whatever.
1639040	1640040	Ayahuasca, right.
1640040	1641040	Oh, God.
1641040	1645040	Yeah, Dustin's uploading videos where I'm doing rape raps and stuff.
1645040	1647040	You guys did Ayahuasca last night?
1647040	1648040	No, no.
1648040	1651040	A guy gave us a jar of, if you're listening in customs,
1651040	1657040	a guy gave us a jar of, or just the police, just the regular police also.
1658040	1661040	Or just like an Amazon tribe if you want to murder us.
1661040	1663040	Any number of criminals?
1663040	1668040	If you're a talking jaguar, you might be interested in this.
1668040	1672040	Oh, now they're all going to be able to talk to us.
1672040	1676040	A fan of ours in, where were we?
1676040	1677040	I don't know, I wasn't there.
1677040	1679040	It was Madison.
1679040	1680040	Madison.
1680040	1681040	No, it wasn't.
1681040	1682040	It was Madison.
1682040	1683040	Okay, thank you.
1683040	1689040	We were in Madison, and a fan of ours who had come all the way up from somewhere south
1689040	1690040	of the Chattahoochee.
1690040	1691040	Iowa.
1691040	1694040	Right.
1694040	1698040	He brought a jar of, he just went up to the boom mic operator,
1698040	1700040	the sound guy on the documentary.
1700040	1701040	He didn't give it to me.
1701040	1702040	He didn't give it to...
1702040	1703040	What was it?
1703040	1704040	They just gave him a jar of like black tar and said,
1704040	1706040	that's Ayahuasca.
1706040	1707040	This isn't game time.
1707040	1708040	It's not really Ayahuasca though.
1708040	1710040	It might just be Coke.
1710040	1711040	Like the beverage.
1711040	1713040	It's dark brown.
1713040	1715040	Well, it looks like it could be, yeah.
1715040	1717040	Wait, so he gave you a jar of hallucinogens?
1717040	1718040	Supposedly.
1718040	1721040	I mean, Brandon, our sound guy is the stoniest looking member of our group.
1721040	1722040	Yeah.
1722040	1723040	Brandon, where you at?
1723040	1725040	Right here.
1725040	1726040	Show yourself, Brandon.
1726040	1728040	I don't know if you guys saw the photo of him doing karaoke, wherever we were,
1728040	1730040	and he had to hit us all off his mic.
1730040	1732040	He can do a, he does a mean beatbox.
1732040	1733040	Brandon, get up here.
1733040	1735040	Beatbox time.
1736040	1743040	The audience is lukewarmers, but okay, so just more rapping.
1743040	1744040	All right.
1744040	1749040	I thought you would talk about masturbating more.
1752040	1753040	Brandon Lillias.
1753040	1757040	For his debut on stage, I'm not mistaken, right?
1757040	1762040	This sounds made up, but like, this sounds absolutely made up.
1762040	1765040	Brandon is a fourth-generation sound engineer.
1765040	1768040	Wait, doesn't that predate sound?
1768040	1769040	Well, that's the thing.
1769040	1771040	This sounds absolutely made up.
1771040	1772040	His great-grandfather...
1772040	1773040	Or Coney.
1773040	1777040	His great-grandfather did sound on the jazz singer.
1777040	1778040	Yeah.
1778040	1779040	Was that him?
1779040	1781040	Another Neil Diamond one.
1781040	1785040	But there was actually a movie before the jazz singer was the first talkie,
1785040	1787040	but there was sound in a movie previous to that that year.
1787040	1788040	Don Juan, yeah.
1788040	1789040	Basically, they had sound.
1789040	1792040	They recorded the soundtrack for Don Juan, which is music,
1792040	1795040	which at the time, having an actor talk was very controversial.
1795040	1796040	So, yeah.
1796040	1797040	It sounds made up, right?
1797040	1798040	Like he's a sociopath.
1798040	1799040	Oh, yeah.
1799040	1801040	I'm not just a boom operator.
1801040	1804040	I'm actually part of a load lineage of people who...
1804040	1805040	Oh, my old...
1805040	1812040	Biff Tannen started holding a boom mic when it was just a stick and a rock
1812040	1815040	that cavemen talked into.
1815040	1818040	Yeah, it was a shell and a pelican over there.
1818040	1819040	It's a living.
1819040	1823040	But if he's lying, he's busted down.
1823040	1825040	Also, like, when did you find this out?
1825040	1826040	When I was away?
1826040	1827040	Yeah, man.
1827040	1828040	Dude, we crew together.
1828040	1829040	Fucking hell.
1829040	1830040	I'm so jealous.
1830040	1831040	You guys are...
1831040	1834040	All that time you spend taking us to places that aren't dinosaur bars,
1834040	1838040	you can use that to grow as a human being.
1838040	1839040	I'm shallow.
1839040	1842040	I don't deny that, but you guys are really connecting out there.
1842040	1843040	You're a foodie.
1843040	1844040	We became human-y.
1844040	1845040	I'm not a foodie.
1845040	1847040	We're people-y.
1847040	1849040	I'm not a foodie because I hate that word.
1849040	1850040	I'm more of a wordie.
1850040	1853040	I'm not a foodie because I hate that word.
1853040	1856040	A beatboxing like his mouth is a turd.
1856040	1858040	Big sounds coming out of his mouth.
1858040	1861040	I got a rending on the beatbox going down south.
1861040	1864040	Got a mountain top on Denver.
1864040	1865040	Got a beatbox.
1865040	1867040	Sorry, I'm listening to him.
1867040	1868040	Okay, hold on.
1868040	1869040	Beatbox.
1869040	1870040	Beatbox.
1870040	1871040	Beatbox.
1871040	1872040	Beatbox.
1872040	1873040	Go.
1873040	1874040	I'm talking into the mic stand.
1874040	1876040	Now I got a mic, so let's see how this will land.
1876040	1879040	I don't even know what else I could say.
1879040	1882040	You just kind of gave it to me in a half-assed way
1882040	1885040	and expected me to start rapping for all of y'all.
1885040	1888040	I don't even know, but I'm having a ball.
1888040	1889040	It's a really great time.
1889040	1893040	I'm at Harman Town, and everybody knows I'm standing here throwing it down,
1893040	1895040	but I'm sitting there.
1895040	1897040	Dice roll in Spencer.
1897040	1899040	Yo, pussy roll in Spencer.
1899040	1901040	Got the Spencer on the mic.
1901040	1902040	Got the Spencer on the rug.
1902040	1905040	Fuck your mama so hard that she thought I was a bug.
1905040	1908040	She said, my pussy's so big, you're so small.
1908040	1911040	Fuck your mama so hard, she looked like she had a ball.
1911040	1914040	She was in a room with a chandelier.
1914040	1917040	I gave her two balls and a dick and said, here.
1917040	1926040	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
1926040	1929040	Guy with a beard's gonna do a little rash now.
1929040	1941040	No. Okay, no, no, oh, no, no, no, no, yo, yo Thursdays break to.
1941040	1944040	All right.
1944040	1947040	Brandon Noliam.
1947040	1949040	It's an all. Thank you, sir.
1949040	1951040	Thank you, Brandon.
1951040	1954040	It's fantastic.
1955040	1963040	It's funny because his job is to capture sound, but he's a giant with a booming voice that has a great beatbox.
1963040	1965040	He really is enormous.
1965040	1967040	And loud.
1967040	1972040	He's supposed to capture sound, but he creates so much more than he captures.
1972040	1974040	Maybe not more than he captures.
1974040	1976040	It makes him sound like a bad sound guy.
1976040	1985040	The ghost of his great-grandfather is gonna haunt him and it's gonna crisp, clean.
1985040	1987040	There will be no clipping.
1987040	1995040	There will be no plosives.
1995040	2001040	It's my grandpa, the guy that invented the Dixie cup and the string.
2001040	2009040	Jeff, how do we make people love each other?
2009040	2014040	Well, turn the lights down real low.
2014040	2016040	I think what you do is be honest.
2016040	2022040	You expose yourself and that allows other people to release themselves out there, too.
2022040	2025040	Alternate pitch.
2025040	2029040	Sports corner!
2031040	2042040	Hello, Denver, Colorado.
2042040	2044040	Sports corner.
2044040	2046040	Come at you with your host, Dan Harmon.
2046040	2048040	He loves sports, especially local teams.
2048040	2053040	His knowledge of local sports teams and statistics will blow your mind.
2053040	2056040	Brought to you by Fat Tire.
2056040	2057040	Fat Tire beer.
2057040	2066040	Get your butt done.
2066040	2067040	That's it for sports corner.
2067040	2068040	Thanks everybody.
2068040	2071040	How are you doing, sir?
2071040	2072040	Hey, Dan.
2072040	2073040	Yeah, Jeff.
2073040	2074040	Denver, Colorado.
2074040	2076040	Holy shit, what a season.
2076040	2078040	Yeah, what a season.
2078040	2081040	So you said it was your first time at Mile High Stadium.
2081040	2082040	What do you take away from that experience?
2082040	2083040	Oh, God.
2083040	2090040	You know, if there's ever been an altar to the grace that is America's favorite sport,
2090040	2091040	it is Mile High Stadium.
2091040	2093040	You can feel the fans there.
2093040	2096040	You can feel that they're getting what they want and wanting what they get.
2096040	2102040	You can sense just even when the place is empty, I go down there with my daughter every fall
2102040	2105040	and I sit and I just take in.
2105040	2110040	I tell her, this is the stadium that God built for this sport.
2110040	2112040	And this sport alone.
2112040	2119040	I don't mean to change sports, but what do you think is the most important role on the
2119040	2122040	Colorado Rockies, the most important position on the Rockies?
2122040	2125040	Definitely the top position.
2125040	2129040	The most significant player and role position.
2129040	2131040	Yeah, the highest one.
2131040	2134040	The most significant on the field.
2134040	2139040	Tyler, who plays Perry.
2139040	2147040	Well, he'll be playing Perry next season, but Tyler is on top now.
2147040	2150040	I mean, do you think the Rockies can rebuild after last season?
2150040	2157040	I think the Rockies are in the downslide, but that can be a precursor to an upswing.
2157040	2158040	Right.
2158040	2163040	I believe that as my grandpa used to say in Oklahoma back when we used to watch the Nuggets.
2163040	2164040	Uncle Homo?
2164040	2165040	Oklahoma?
2165040	2168040	I thought you called your grandpa Uncle Homo.
2169040	2175040	I'm from Wisconsin, Jeff, where grandpas are known as Uncle Homos.
2175040	2179040	It's like a Mima or a Pop Pop.
2179040	2183040	In Wisconsin, we called our grandpas Uncle Homos.
2183040	2186040	I understand that's an offensive phrase, but hey.
2186040	2189040	I guess what I'm trying to say is, what sport do the Rockies play?
2189040	2194040	America's favorite?
2195040	2197040	Which is?
2197040	2201040	They play ball, man. They play ball.
2201040	2203040	They play football.
2203040	2204040	No.
2204040	2205040	Basketball.
2205040	2206040	Yeah, you're right.
2206040	2208040	They play basketball. I know.
2208040	2212040	Who are you, quizzing me? I'm the sports guy.
2212040	2219040	Listen, those Nuggets got to get out there like front and center, or the Rockies are going to take it.
2219040	2226040	Are you saying that the Denver Nuggets are doing so poorly that the Colorado Rockies might move in on their actions?
2226040	2231040	Stranger things have happened, Jeff, with the wild card system and going to second procedurals,
2231040	2237040	we've got a second tertiary format here, a 7-10 split, veritably speaking, and the all-conference.
2237040	2240040	If you go to all-stars and then you come down to the single individuals,
2240040	2246040	then what we're talking about is a potential Nuggets coup over the Rockies in the spring semester,
2247040	2250040	or it's not a 40-point spread.
2254040	2256040	They agree. They seem to agree.
2256040	2264040	I mean, the sports news cycle, we've heard so much about it, but you know more than anybody.
2264040	2267040	When do you think that this NHL lockout's going to end?
2267040	2270040	God, Jeff, if I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times.
2270040	2272040	Yardage.
2273040	2275040	Sports corner again, huh?
2276040	2281040	That's pretty good.
2281040	2289040	I can't tell the difference between Grey Goose and Kettle One, but I can tell the difference between Siroc, Snap Frost, Vodka.
2289040	2290040	Yeah, the venue doesn't have it.
2290040	2292040	Kettle One had a chance to be our sponsor.
2292040	2294040	They have Grey Goose. Grey Goose is great.
2294040	2295040	Goose.
2295040	2296040	So you thought.
2296040	2299040	It's fine. Vodka's vodka, honestly, kids.
2299040	2303040	You know what breaks my heart, Jeff, is when the kids don't know their vodka?
2303040	2304040	Yeah.
2304040	2309040	We've played these venues under 21-plus or 18-plus, 21- or whatever they are,
2309040	2313040	and then we're signing things after the show.
2313040	2317040	So every once in a while, like two people my age will come up to me and go,
2317040	2320040	Harry, could you sign us for our daughter, Ariel?
2320040	2323040	She's 16. She's not allowed to come to the show.
2323040	2325040	She's a mermaid.
2325040	2328040	And I go, well, she...
2328040	2330040	Jesus Christ, you guys.
2331040	2335040	Do you want to cause another fight?
2337040	2338040	Yes.
2338040	2341040	I'm sorry I picked that name, but they go,
2341040	2345040	she can't come tonight, and we came, and then we got...
2345040	2348040	Because her ponytails are too red and bouncy.
2348040	2350040	She had volleyball practice.
2352040	2355040	My point, Jeff, is that sometimes, every once in a while,
2355040	2358040	in every third city, a set of parents will come up to me,
2358040	2361040	one or more parents, who aren't even fans of the show,
2361040	2364040	don't even care, who sit for two hours and listen to me talk about
2364040	2368040	decks and balls and rapping and Dungeons & Dragons,
2368040	2375040	and they're only here just to get a signature for their underage child.
2375040	2378040	It really, like, bums me out.
2378040	2380040	And I'm like, did you have a good time?
2380040	2383040	And they're like, you're great, you're great.
2383040	2389040	Just, her name's Rachel, and can't wait to drive this back to Omaha.
2389040	2391040	Like, that's fucked up.
2392040	2397040	Best parents, first of all, they deserve better than two hours of me.
2397040	2399040	Best kid in the world, I don't know.
2399040	2401040	What do you do there, Jeff? What do you do?
2401040	2403040	Do you sing a song?
2403040	2405040	No, no, I'm kidding.
2405040	2407040	I think you sing a song.
2407040	2409040	Let's meet some people from our audience, Jeff.
2409040	2411040	I'm sorry, I'm spraying.
2411040	2415040	My mustache is, I'm spraying vodka all over everyone.
2415040	2417040	You've eaten all the cheese sticks, so that doesn't matter.
2417040	2419040	There's one left, you want to get that?
2419040	2421040	There's two left.
2421040	2423040	Thank you, Ariel.
2427040	2429040	I'm going to die.
2429040	2433040	Well, you're not putting up much of a fight.
2433040	2435040	I'm going to die, Jeff.
2435040	2438040	There was 18 pizza boxes in that room today.
2441040	2443040	Dan, you're beautiful.
2443040	2445040	You're beautiful. People like you.
2445040	2447040	I don't deserve to be loved.
2447040	2449040	Dan, Kansas City was a fluke.
2449040	2451040	I wasn't there, the room was bad.
2451040	2453040	They had so many nachos.
2457040	2459040	I've got to get back on my diet, Jeff.
2459040	2461040	Yeah, so what?
2461040	2463040	I'm verging on accharide.
2463040	2467040	I'm going to be accharide by Portland.
2467040	2469040	He got pretty large.
2469040	2472040	Accharide got inexplicably large.
2472040	2475040	He'd be into how weird it is, how large he got.
2475040	2477040	He'd be like, oh, it's a mystery.
2477040	2480040	Maybe the crystal skull made me so fat.
2480040	2484040	I told you once that I somehow, like an after-after-after party,
2484040	2486040	ended up at Dan Accharide's house,
2486040	2489040	and he was as big as a poor person's house,
2489040	2493040	but fortunately he had a huge mansion where houses fit inside it.
2493040	2496040	There were poor people living in him.
2496040	2498040	Hey, keep it down out there.
2498040	2501040	We're trying to write our version of Ghostbusters.
2501040	2504040	It was like 3 or 4 a.m., and he just made a pizza.
2504040	2507040	Not like took a dijorno out of the freezer and put it in the oven.
2507040	2509040	He just shook his shirt out.
2511040	2513040	Ball of dough came out.
2514040	2516040	He shook the ears like it's sauce.
2516040	2519040	Like a Golden Retriever getting out of a river.
2519040	2522040	Just shook his body and a pizza came out.
2523040	2527040	But I said I'd be a bad friend if I didn't tell you.
2527040	2531040	My best friends and I, we think Ghostbusters is one of the best movies of all time,
2531040	2533040	and he was like, hey, you know what?
2533040	2535040	He wanted to talk about Ghostbusters all night long.
2535040	2537040	It was pretty cool.
2537040	2540040	I'm sorry, we made fun of how fat he is.
2541040	2543040	If he's listening.
2543040	2545040	He almost certainly is listening.
2545040	2551040	I don't, big trouble, I didn't see big trouble.
2551040	2554040	Big trouble was, oh, that was a doozy.
2554040	2556040	Was he just big in that one?
2558040	2562040	I didn't see that movie, but he looked like he could have had a fat suit on.
2562040	2564040	I mean, he was very, very big.
2564040	2566040	I think he's lost weight since then, right?
2566040	2567040	I don't know.
2567040	2569040	These people don't even know who he is.
2569040	2571040	Yeah, they're like, what? Dan Aykroyd?
2571040	2573040	Was he in the in sync?
2576040	2579040	Yeah, he's Canadian, he's in sync.
2579040	2581040	Way to go, Harmon.
2581040	2585040	That was a real attempt to grab a current reference.
2586040	2588040	What do you think on the top of the charts, like pop charts, right?
2588040	2589040	Who's on the top of the charts?
2589040	2591040	Nora Jones.
2592040	2594040	I don't know.
2595040	2597040	Tyler Perry.
2598040	2602040	Tyler Perry's Velvet Revolver.
2603040	2607040	There's got to be a band that Tyler Perry owns, right?
2607040	2609040	Tyler Perry's...
2609040	2613040	Tyler Perry Flood Bunch?
2613040	2615040	Run DMC, right?
2615040	2617040	Tyler Perry and the Funky Bunch.
2617040	2620040	I want to bring up a special guest.
2620040	2623040	I met her in the bar before we came up.
2623040	2625040	Here.
2626040	2627040	Have a drink.
2627040	2628040	Yeah.
2628040	2630040	It's the cheese sticks and the altitude, I'm sorry.
2630040	2633040	Certainly not the gallon of vodka.
2639040	2641040	Is JJ from Vienna here?
2641040	2642040	Slovenia.
2642040	2643040	Slovenia?
2643040	2645040	Wait, she said she was from...
2645040	2646040	From Vienna?
2646040	2648040	She was in Vienna at some point.
2648040	2649040	Where is JJ?
2649040	2650040	JJ.
2650040	2651040	JJ, can you make it to the stage?
2651040	2653040	She's got to be the one that drove the furthest.
2653040	2655040	She's from Europe.
2655040	2658040	I usually ask, who drove the furthest?
2661040	2667040	She drove from Europe in a special ski car.
2668040	2670040	It's JJ.
2670040	2671040	She's foreign.
2671040	2674040	She's from a different land.
2674040	2677040	She's never been this high.
2677040	2678040	On the mountain.
2678040	2679040	Hello, JJ.
2679040	2680040	Hello.
2680040	2681040	Good to see you again.
2681040	2682040	Good to see you again.
2682040	2684040	She's come to shows...
2684040	2685040	Are you independently wealthy?
2685040	2689040	How can you afford to keep flying out here from Europe to see these shows?
2689040	2692040	I think every time it's safe to go somewhere else to South America,
2692040	2694040	I've wanted to go to Peru for a while,
2694040	2696040	and every time it ends up being one of your shows.
2696040	2697040	Well, we're like Peru.
2697040	2698040	We're like Peru.
2698040	2700040	We have ayahuasca.
2700040	2702040	We'll get you high like Peru.
2702040	2704040	And you brought us lovely cookies backstage.
2704040	2708040	Those are awesome German little wafers and cookies and stuff.
2708040	2710040	Something else waiting for you, but that's after the show.
2710040	2711040	Oh.
2711040	2712040	Oh.
2715040	2719040	Everyone gets late tonight.
2719040	2722040	It's a sweeter show.
2722040	2725040	Leave your keys in the cheese basket.
2727040	2731040	Everyone just puts their keys in a deep fried cheese basket.
2731040	2734040	Oh, I'm with Dave.
2734040	2736040	I'm with Tony.
2736040	2738040	There's three women here.
2742040	2744040	J.G., what do you do?
2744040	2747040	I work at the British Embassy in Vienna.
2747040	2748040	The British Embassy in Vienna.
2748040	2751040	And you have that much free time to come and see stupid comedy shows like ours?
2751040	2754040	No, I just took three days off on the weekend.
2754040	2755040	And you were with a friend too, right?
2755040	2757040	Is she from out of the...?
2757040	2759040	No, my friend couldn't make it.
2759040	2762040	She went through the sensory guards.
2762040	2764040	How many languages do you speak?
2764040	2765040	Four.
2765040	2766040	What are they?
2766040	2767040	English.
2767040	2768040	German.
2768040	2769040	German.
2769040	2770040	Slovene, French.
2771040	2774040	There was a French audience member here as well.
2774040	2775040	Oh, yeah?
2775040	2778040	Were you Parley Hurring?
2781040	2782040	Give us some Slovenian.
2782040	2785040	I don't know if I've ever heard Slovenian.
2785040	2787040	Say, come on down to Harmon Town.
2787040	2789040	Turn that frown upside down.
2789040	2790040	Pia's yellow, pooping.
2790040	2794040	Oh, can you sing our little hook in Slovenian?
2794040	2795040	Is that possible?
2795040	2796040	Is that possible?
2797040	2798040	All right.
2799040	2802040	International UK Power Mix.
2805040	2807040	Lady Gaga style.
2807040	2808040	Don't know what that means.
2808040	2810040	Just grabbing.
2810040	2811040	Okay, Daniel, you want to lead her in?
2811040	2813040	Yo, yo, yo.
2813040	2816040	International, I'm irrational.
2816040	2818040	I'm international, national, international.
2818040	2821040	Motherfucker, gonna rap so hard, gonna drop the mic.
2821040	2823040	Chris Tucker style.
2823040	2825040	Chris Rock drops the mic.
2825040	2827040	Chris Tucker's another person.
2827040	2829040	The race is alike.
2829040	2830040	That makes me racist.
2830040	2833040	I didn't confuse them.
2833040	2834040	I love black people.
2834040	2835040	Take it JJ.
2847040	2848040	Yo.
2848040	2850040	Foreign language.
2850040	2853040	Foreign tongue going on the anguish.
2853040	2855040	I'm gonna go out in the crowd.
2855040	2858040	I'm international now, so I'm rapping twice as loud.
2858040	2861040	Got the whole planet going full global.
2861040	2864040	Got your mama's cell phone and her titties, her mobile.
2864040	2868040	Got your AT&T and her TTs on my sprint.
2868040	2871040	I'm gonna put it in her PP.
2873040	2875040	Rapping more.
2875040	2877040	Just gonna rap some more.
2877040	2878040	Take it, take it.
2883040	2884040	No.
2889040	2894040	Yo, it's like fancy shit here out on a patio in Amsterdam and shit.
2894040	2898040	Sipping coffee and holding money, money.
2898040	2900040	But it has pictures of people you've never seen.
2900040	2902040	This was ridiculous.
2902040	2904040	And you've smoke and weed for free.
2904040	2905040	German.
2914040	2916040	Get out of here.
2916040	2918040	International rinks, they may apply.
2918040	2920040	Fucked your mama so hard.
2920040	2922040	My penis came through her fly.
2922040	2924040	I put her weiner into her shoe.
2924040	2926040	I put her shoe on her head.
2926040	2928040	I said, how do you do?
2928040	2929040	I went to Heathrow.
2929040	2930040	It's like a hub.
2930040	2932040	I fucked your mama so hard.
2932040	2934040	She said, give me a shoulder rub.
2934040	2935040	I'm feeling tense.
2935040	2937040	I need a massage.
2937040	2940040	I fucked your mama in the house in her garage.
2940040	2942040	Spencer's gonna come to the mic.
2942040	2945040	I'm gonna hand it off because he's who you like.
2945040	2948040	Yo, I got monsters in a cage.
2948040	2951040	And everybody sees me because I'm all the rage.
2951040	2954040	And I don't mean rage like a barbarian rage.
2954040	2955040	Let me get off this rhyme.
2955040	2957040	Let me turn the page.
2957040	2958040	That's all I got.
2958040	2961040	Let me see if I can try some more.
2961040	2963040	Maybe I'll just sit up here and fry.
2963040	2965040	I think that's all I got right now.
2965040	2967040	So we'll go to the chorus.
2968040	2970040	Out of harm in town.
2970040	2973040	Ditch, man, black and goog in the club.
2973040	2976040	We'll see how the big place round.
2976040	2979040	Come on down to harm in town.
2979040	2982040	Vain, gandos, ah, harm in town.
2982040	2984040	And barre de nous lique.
2984040	2985040	I don't know if I said that.
2985040	2990040	Pee-bee is a barrio, a pecaca is a correno.
2990040	2992040	You gotta know how to do it.
2992040	2995040	I fucked your mama so hard.
2995040	2996040	She said, fabbles.
2996040	2998040	Fabbles-less.
2998040	3000040	Language is piss.
3000040	3001040	It just comes out.
3001040	3003040	It runs that way in this.
3003040	3005040	Nobody knows what any words mean.
3005040	3008040	We all say what we say, and then we see what we mean.
3008040	3010040	I rhyme with mean with mean.
3010040	3012040	I'm doing a bad scene.
3012040	3013040	I'm a bad person.
3013040	3016040	I'm 40 years old, and I'm a clean cuisine.
3016040	3017040	I don't want to be fat.
3017040	3019040	I don't want to be an angry.
3019040	3020040	I don't want to get big as that.
3020040	3022040	I just want a ghost bust.
3022040	3023040	Who are you going to call?
3023040	3025040	I'm going to call Jenny Craig.
3025040	3027040	Before I take a diabetes call.
3027040	3030040	I'm right now in the east bound room.
3030040	3033040	I'm Bob Snow, a pioneering shmogan.
3033040	3034040	A charming shmogan.
3034040	3036040	A flag of spout.
3036040	3037040	A crumbling shmogan.
3037040	3039040	A heartburn sound.
3039040	3040040	Thank you, JJ.
3047040	3048040	Thank you.
3048040	3049040	Somidian JJ.
3049040	3050040	Thank you, JJ.
3050040	3051040	Somidian JJ!
3052040	3055040	Somidian JJ!
3055040	3057040	Get away from me!
3057040	3059040	Somidian JJ!
3059040	3062040	Running poo with pee!
3062040	3064040	But is it D&D time, I believe?
3064040	3065040	At D&D time, I believe.
3065040	3066040	Yeah, let's do this thing.
3066040	3068040	All right, are you guys ready for D&D?
3070040	3072040	Aaron McGathey, join us on stage, please.
3072040	3074040	Aaron with McGathey.
3082040	3084040	I think we're sharing a mic.
3084040	3086040	Denver style.
3086040	3088040	It's the altitude.
3088040	3093040	The electricity doesn't get through the cords as fast.
3093040	3095040	Fun show.
3095040	3096040	Oh, thanks.
3096040	3098040	Yeah, you guys are great.
3098040	3100040	You guys are great.
3100040	3102040	I'm not pandering.
3104040	3106040	You're backstage watching Gator Boys, right?
3106040	3108040	Yeah, are you watching Gator Boys right there?
3108040	3113040	They sent me up in a nice little booth and brought me tacos and drinks,
3113040	3116040	and I've just been sitting back there like a king.
3116040	3119040	My feet up on the chairs have been great.
3119040	3122040	They asked me to leave, but it's been a lot of fun.
3122040	3124040	They asked you to leave?
3124040	3126040	Not really, I'm just making a joke.
3126040	3127040	I put my feet up.
3127040	3129040	Oh, got it.
3129040	3131040	It's okay, everybody.
3131040	3133040	We should find you a stool.
3133040	3135040	Here, you sit on this one.
3135040	3137040	I feel weird.
3137040	3139040	Well, we have to share a mic.
3139040	3143040	We'll edit this part out where I'm talking about the mic that we have to share.
3143040	3146040	But then I won't edit it out.
3146040	3148040	Because it'll have charm.
3148040	3150040	How do you feel about us sharing a mic?
3150040	3152040	Great.
3152040	3156040	Spencer, get us up to date because I missed a bit, so catch me up if you would.
3157040	3162040	Last time we met, our heroes had been journeying in the belly of the beast,
3162040	3165040	the mysterious and mythical and finna fish.
3165040	3167040	After Sharpie found what looked like a lung,
3167040	3170040	the group rejoined and entered through a large cavity
3170040	3173040	that Quark had slashed in the side of the Great Organ.
3173040	3177040	Entering the lung, a slimy creature had dropped in from the ceiling
3177040	3182040	onto the bottom of this chamber, followed by several electrical spidery minions.
3182040	3184040	After the dust of combat had settled,
3184040	3187040	Sharpie, Quark, and Mulrane were victorious.
3187040	3190040	Hoping to damage the lung with the smoke from their smoke sticks,
3190040	3193040	Sharpie and Mulrane ignited them as well as all their torches.
3194040	3197040	And as the damage was being dealt to the vicious lung,
3197040	3200040	Quark destroyed the remnants with his flaming sword,
3200040	3205040	and together they all fell below, back into the chamber before they had left.
3206040	3207040	Uh, yeah.
3207040	3211040	They had made some progress, but where would they proceed from here?
3212040	3213040	Thank you, Spencer.
3213040	3214040	Yeah.
3214040	3215040	Alright.
3215040	3216040	So, uh, yeah.
3216040	3220040	He's a big rap star now, so he's phoning in his DMing a little bit.
3220040	3223040	I just lost my place in the writing, reading.
3223040	3225040	He sounds like Don LaFontaine now.
3225040	3226040	In a world.
3226040	3227040	He's kicking back.
3227040	3228040	He's Snoop style now.
3228040	3229040	He's like...
3230040	3231040	I don't know.
3231040	3232040	In a world.
3233040	3234040	He found a sword.
3235040	3237040	Don't try to pick a fight with Spencer on stage, man.
3237040	3240040	I need for my documentary that I'm producing about myself,
3240040	3243040	I need a death to happen to this.
3243040	3244040	I need a conflict.
3245040	3248040	Well, maybe you'll die in this round of D&D.
3248040	3249040	Yeah.
3249040	3251040	Take some fucking chances out there, man.
3251040	3252040	Yeah, okay.
3252040	3253040	Have another cheese stick.
3255040	3256040	Oh, shit.
3257040	3258040	I was joking, honey.
3258040	3259040	I was joking.
3260040	3261040	Baby, no!
3261040	3262040	Baby!
3263040	3264040	Baby, no, no, not the ranch.
3268040	3269040	Dan!
3271040	3273040	Dan just put the cheese stick on his face.
3273040	3274040	Put them on top.
3274040	3276040	He's crying ranch tears right now.
3277040	3278040	That is truly horrifying.
3280040	3281040	You've got it on your eyelashes.
3282040	3283040	Don't Instagram me!
3297040	3298040	That is fucked up.
3299040	3300040	Wow.
3301040	3302040	You have a problem, sir.
3303040	3304040	No, don't!
3304040	3305040	No!
3306040	3307040	No!
3308040	3309040	No!
3310040	3312040	He just drank the ranch like a jager bomb.
3313040	3314040	No.
3315040	3316040	A table of enablers?
3318040	3319040	Fucking hell.
3320040	3321040	He has pay guys.
3321040	3322040	Anybody have one of those?
3325040	3326040	Thank you for the napkins.
3326040	3328040	Does anybody have one of those Pulp Fiction adrenaline syringes
3328040	3330040	that we can plunge into a elevator on?
3331040	3335040	Has anyone else gone so off a diet that you start putting food
3335040	3336040	in places it doesn't go?
3338040	3339040	Ranch in your ears.
3339040	3341040	You had ranch mascara on for a moment.
3342040	3343040	That was wild.
3343040	3344040	Oh, boy.
3345040	3347040	By the way, the shame of Jeff walking into our hotel room
3348040	3350040	earlier tonight was palpable.
3352040	3355040	When we opened the door and you were standing there,
3356040	3358040	I was scared because I knew it was inside that room.
3359040	3361040	Yeah, it looked like a city fucking dump in here.
3362040	3363040	It did look like a city dump.
3363040	3365040	I mean, there was a large collection of plates and things.
3366040	3367040	There was plates and there was pizza boxes,
3368040	3369040	and there was what looked like a...
3370040	3371040	There's a lot of love.
3371040	3372040	A skeletonized lamb.
3377040	3380040	There wasn't any ranch because he certainly had drunk it all.
3383040	3384040	Don't let him hurt you.
3385040	3386040	Don't let him hurt you.
3390040	3394040	Don't make your movie arc death an actual death argument.
3395040	3396040	It's a bad movie.
3400040	3401040	This is going to be a long ride to the bus today.
3402040	3404040	Only one thing is going to make me feel better.
3405040	3406040	Ice cream!
3408040	3410040	What if we had ice cream dancers come out?
3412040	3414040	The show would stop if you would eat ice cream.
3416040	3418040	Okay, so watching me eat ice cream could be the show.
3418040	3420040	These people love me no matter what I do.
3421040	3422040	They love me.
3422040	3423040	I created community!
3424040	3427040	I'm going to eat myself to death in front of you!
3429040	3430040	Wow, somebody stop them.
3431040	3432040	Fuck it.
3432040	3433040	We're going to go back to L.A.
3433040	3435040	and you're going to be just a big fat cunt when you get out of there.
3438040	3439040	It has become a thing.
3440040	3441040	I'm off my diet for seven days.
3442040	3448040	That rebellion has become a really aggressive, violent thing against your health and our children.
3449040	3451040	I saw you putting some cheese sticks down at Toby Keef's.
3452040	3453040	I love this bar and grill across the way.
3454040	3455040	Those are potato skins.
3455040	3456040	Get your shits to it.
3457040	3458040	That was zucchini.
3459040	3460040	And I ate the zucchini out of the fried...
3461040	3462040	Yeah.
3463040	3464040	The healthy zucchini with the fried in the ranch.
3466040	3467040	Toby Keef's is...
3468040	3469040	By the way, there's room over there.
3470040	3471040	If you guys want to go to Toby Keef's...
3472040	3473040	What's the name of his bar?
3474040	3476040	Toby Keef's spade in on me loving something with...
3477040	3479040	Cut to, smash cut, car chase,
3480040	3481040	dragon comes down from the sky.
3482040	3483040	I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
3484040	3485040	Let's go to a bar tonight.
3486040	3488040	Toby Keef's a hubris bar in lunch.
3489040	3490040	Toby Keef's, I can't lose.
3491040	3493040	Toby Keef's 20-page name for a bar.
3494040	3496040	There's room for 4,000 people at that bar.
3497040	3498040	We were the only three people in there.
3499040	3505040	And the laminate sticker that they used to make the drywall that the bars made out of look like wood?
3506040	3507040	The sticker's coming off everywhere.
3508040	3509040	We were trying to figure out...
3510040	3511040	Do people dance on the bar?
3512040	3513040	Is that why it's all peeled back?
3514040	3515040	That would be a cool reason.
3516040	3518040	It's like, oh yeah, it's a honky tonk.
3519040	3521040	We honky the tonk off the top of the bar.
3522040	3524040	I asked the bartender, how does this happen?
3525040	3526040	And she goes, I don't know, they just pick at it.
3527040	3528040	They?
3529040	3531040	The animals that you are a zookeeper for?
3532040	3533040	They just pick at it.
3534040	3535040	That's like something you'd hear at a zoo.
3535040	3536040	They just pick at it, I don't know.
3537040	3538040	They think the tire's a swing.
3539040	3543040	They think the giraffes mistake the Rusty Jones sticker for a berry.
3544040	3546040	That's why they're breaking the windows on your cars.
3549040	3553040	Let's all go over there and let's see if we can pick off like right harm in town.
3554040	3555040	Does anybody have a chisel?
3556040	3557040	It's grody over there, man.
3558040	3559040	Yeah, it's a bummer.
3560040	3561040	I expected more out of Toby Keef, really.
3563040	3564040	That name screams class.
3565040	3567040	That guy's made a living on a supporting troops, nothing more.
3568040	3569040	There's a lobby.
3570040	3572040	It's filled with pictures of him supporting the troops.
3573040	3575040	He's playing guitar in all these different forms of camouflage.
3576040	3578040	He's a cockadoodle douchebag.
3579040	3582040	He's so fucking full of his own shit and fucking food.
3583040	3584040	Fuck you, Toby Keef, you bigger than me?
3585040	3588040	You kick my ass, but I will fucking, I will constantly call your fucking shit.
3591040	3593040	Having a real country music, that stuff is so fucking retarded.
3593040	3594040	It's not good.
3595040	3596040	I hate Toby.
3597040	3598040	Toby? Toby.
3599040	3600040	Your name's Toby Keef.
3601040	3602040	What's your last name?
3605040	3607040	I think you know more about Toby Keef than I do.
3608040	3612040	Do you think, like if he was to walk into that bar the same way that we walked into the bar?
3613040	3614040	I know he would love it.
3615040	3617040	Would it empty? Would he be like, well, that's a Tuesday.
3618040	3620040	Or like, what would his reaction be?
3621040	3622040	I don't think he would walk into it,
3623040	3624040	but I don't think he has any connection to this thing.
3625040	3627040	I think it's a stupid corporate adventure, or venture rather.
3628040	3629040	I would really like to hear Jeff's Toby Keef song.
3630040	3631040	Isn't there a country song on the iPad?
3632040	3633040	Could you just sing a song about Toby?
3634040	3635040	Do Toby Keef's commercial for...
3638040	3639040	Jeff never sings an open a show.
3640040	3642040	Well, I'm a big old badass dickhead.
3643040	3649040	Kissing on the graves of Hank and all the people that same country before.
3650040	3652040	And I support the troops.
3653040	3654040	What a bold fucking stance that is.
3655040	3656040	I am a modern hero.
3657040	3659040	Gonna put a flag on everything.
3660040	3661040	Fuck you, iPad.
3669040	3670040	I'm gonna put a flag on everything.
3671040	3673040	You can't just come out and go, you can't just come out and go,
3674040	3676040	I've been out there in Iraq and going down US tourism.
3676040	3677040	The US tourism of the troops.
3678040	3680040	Come on, troops, come on, troops everybody, troops.
3681040	3682040	Toby, Toby, Toby, Toby.
3683040	3684040	No, troops, troops.
3685040	3686040	Toby, Toby, Toby.
3687040	3689040	Now, you have agreed, you have agreed to be...
3690040	3691040	I love this podcast.
3692040	3693040	Someone call them Toby.
3694040	3697040	Toby, you have agreed to be the name behind this bar,
3698040	3700040	and we have asked you for months and months,
3701040	3703040	what shall we name this bar and grill?
3704040	3705040	Now, I know you've said...
3707040	3708040	Okay.
3709040	3710040	I love it.
3711040	3712040	I love troops and grills.
3713040	3716040	Toby keeps troops and grills.
3717040	3719040	Toby, that's not so much a name.
3720040	3721040	Grilled troops are half off.
3722040	3723040	Okay.
3724040	3726040	All right, Jared, his eyes are bleeding,
3727040	3728040	so we're just gonna call it that.
3729040	3730040	We're gonna call it that.
3731040	3733040	Grilled troops are delicious because I love them.
3733040	3737040	You have to support a basket of delicious buffalo troops.
3739040	3744040	It's hard to love a troop because it's really, really hard
3745040	3747040	because there are people that might die.
3748040	3749040	Who doesn't love...
3750040	3751040	Who doesn't support the fucking troops?
3752040	3753040	Everybody supports the fucking troops.
3754040	3755040	We love the troops.
3756040	3757040	They're doing the greatest, chittiest, hardest job in the world
3758040	3759040	and they do it with great valor and stuff.
3760040	3761040	I'm not talking shit about the troops.
3761040	3762040	You can't go on a cold bear and go,
3763040	3765040	man, American flag, we just couldn't be down.
3766040	3768040	It's not interesting conversation, Toby,
3769040	3772040	and your music stinks and I'll fucking fight you right after the show.
3775040	3776040	But he's a great guy.
3777040	3778040	I've met him. He's a lovely gentleman.
3779040	3780040	I'm just kidding, Toby. We're old pals.
3781040	3782040	While my friend is fighting you, could I just...
3783040	3784040	One more order of potato skins.
3785040	3787040	They're really good. One more order of potato skins.
3788040	3789040	Coming right up!
3789040	3794040	Do a do, a troop, a troop, a troop, a troop, a troop, potato skin.
3795040	3800040	Star-spangled french fries and shitty hill billy music.
3801040	3805040	I take a little potato skin and I load him up with troops.
3806040	3810040	I shit on wheelers and engraved yesterday just to prove a point.
3811040	3812040	Come on down!
3813040	3818040	Occupy your appetite with an AK-47 up.
3819040	3821040	And Obama is a Muslim.
3822040	3825040	Got an Apache full of french fries.
3826040	3828040	Half-price appetizers.
3829040	3832040	Toby Keith, I love the troops and I fucked your mom.
3833040	3835040	And his bar is absolutely empty across the street
3836040	3838040	and that gives me a fucking thrill to see that.
3839040	3841040	And while I'm saying this, yes, it's not a bold statement to go,
3842040	3844040	God bless America all the time. Yes, of course.
3845040	3846040	Of course God bless America.
3847040	3848040	What else is God going to bless? The Irish?
3849040	3850040	Where are they?
3851040	3852040	But also, I...
3853040	3854040	Oh shit, there's an Irish guy?
3857040	3859040	We'll get to Jerry McSeinfeld, but I was going to say,
3860040	3862040	it's not really in this audience, I'm also being a hypocrite.
3863040	3864040	It's not a bold stance to say fuck you Toby Keith here.
3865040	3866040	That's true, too.
3867040	3868040	I'm not Bill Hicks up here.
3869040	3870040	You're the shadow that Toby Keith casts.
3871040	3872040	He creates a biosphere.
3873040	3874040	Toby Keith's kind of a dick, right?
3875040	3879040	Yeah, he writes songs about giving people swirlies.
3882040	3883040	You got it right?
3884040	3885040	You got it right what you know, man.
3886040	3888040	Toby Keith writes what he knows, we write what we know.
3889040	3890040	I'm sure he's a great person.
3895040	3897040	All right, let's proceed back.
3898040	3900040	Also, don't be big and muscular in the same country.
3901040	3903040	Joe Piscopo when he got big and muscular.
3904040	3906040	Don't be a big muscle bound guy in the same country.
3907040	3908040	I like Garth Brooks swinging around in a wire.
3909040	3910040	I thought that was cool.
3911040	3913040	He takes his job seriously, he's swinging around in a wire.
3914040	3915040	All right Spencer, I examined my surroundings.
3916040	3917040	You're in a large circular room.
3918040	3920040	The walls drip with a green mucus.
3921040	3922040	Wait, this is Toby Keith's place.
3923040	3926040	The laminate is picked off the walls.
3927040	3929040	The appetizers are supportive of the troops.
3930040	3933040	An air of silence and misery hangs over this area.
3934040	3938040	The salt and pepper shakers are hand grenades.
3939040	3941040	Camouflage, lines, the bathrooms.
3942040	3944040	French fries are called freedom freedoms.
3945040	3953040	They say really quickly before I forget that Dungeon Master Spencer and I will be selling merch in that corner after the show.
3954040	3956040	T-shirts $15 or two for $25.
3957040	3958040	And if you buy anything, I'll sign it.
3959040	3960040	Also, I'll sign anything if you don't buy anything.
3961040	3962040	I'll sign a napkin.
3962040	3964040	That's the Toby Keith guarantee.
3965040	3966040	I'll sign it Toby Keith.
3967040	3968040	I'll sign it Toby Keith.
3969040	3976040	If you bring me a kidnapped baby, I'll sign it Toby Keith as a way of getting back at him for holding the nation hostage.
3977040	3978040	I wouldn't know a song of his.
3979040	3980040	What song did he sing?
3981040	3982040	Does anybody know Toby Keith's song?
3983040	3984040	Red Solo Cup?
3985040	3986040	Oh, what a fucking cock.
3988040	3989040	Yeah, wow, clever.
3989040	3990040	What's the point of that song?
3991040	3992040	The story of that song of Red Solo Cup.
3993040	3994040	Let me guess, can I guess?
3995040	3996040	I don't know.
3997040	4001040	It's a guy that, because the Red Party Cup's a solo Red Party Cup, but he's solo tonight.
4002040	4004040	The girl left him, so he's got the Red, okay, that's his better song than he wrote.
4005040	4006040	It's not even that complex.
4007040	4010040	It's literally like, hey, we're all at a party and we all have Red Solo Cups.
4011040	4014040	So much, let's all drink from our Red Solo Cups.
4015040	4017040	Fucking Red Solo Cup-age.
4018040	4019040	Sorry, I thought you were...
4020040	4021040	Yeah, that is heartbreaking.
4022040	4031040	Anyway, I got a thin plastic red vessel, holding all my beer, and I'm catering to frat boys.
4032040	4033040	The end.
4034040	4035040	Let's shoot some deer.
4036040	4038040	Alright, so let's play some D&D for pity's sake.
4039040	4040040	I could just leave, I mean.
4041040	4042040	No, Spencer.
4043040	4044040	Spencer, no.
4045040	4046040	Baby Spencer.
4047040	4048040	Don't mind, it's fine.
4049040	4051040	Alright, well, I described the room you were in.
4052040	4054040	They're turning it up, the sound of the...
4055040	4056040	Whitney Houston song playing.
4057040	4058040	Toby Kate's upstairs.
4059040	4061040	This is what I mean when I said I could leave, like, it's fine.
4062040	4063040	No one can...
4065040	4068040	The podcast won't be able to hear that though, they won't know what we're talking about.
4069040	4073040	There's like a slight, it's like someone's iPhone is in the rafters.
4074040	4075040	Playing on speaker.
4076040	4077040	Yeah.
4079040	4081040	I mean, they've been doing it for 80 minutes.
4083040	4084040	That's how passive it is.
4085040	4086040	It's a slow trickle.
4087040	4088040	That's a trickle playoff.
4089040	4091040	Now it's the sound of the infinifish.
4092040	4093040	Oh, damn.
4094040	4094040	
4095040	4096040	Okay, so you guys basically beat up the lungs, right?
4097040	4098040	You beat up some lungs.
4099040	4100040	Okay, so now we're sitting in a room, are we in the stomach now?
4101040	4103040	You're in that room you were in before with the three different passways.
4104040	4107040	Sharpie took the left, you took the middle, and Lorraine took the right,
4108040	4110040	and then you magically decided to go back to where Sharpie was, you know?
4111040	4112040	Right.
4113040	4116040	So you're in that room, obvious exits north, south, and east,
4117040	4118040	and west will take you back to the village.
4119040	4120040	Where have we not been before?
4121040	4122040	You've been through all of them.
4123040	4125040	But you guys just caught back up with Sharpie when you thought he was...
4126040	4127040	We hit the lungs.
4128040	4129040	That far sword guy, or he go away?
4130040	4131040	He's still around, yeah.
4131040	4132040	He's hanging out.
4133040	4134040	What's up, guys? I'm Valison, the sword guy.
4135040	4136040	Hey, Valison.
4137040	4138040	All right, well, let's go back to...
4139040	4141040	We came through a lung door, so let's not go through that one.
4142040	4146040	Yeah, the one you were through had a hanging kidney-bean-shaped organ, if you'll recall.
4147040	4148040	Right.
4149040	4150040	That's the kidneys, right?
4151040	4152040	I mean, I can't tell you.
4153040	4155040	I rush headlong, barbarian-style into the kidney...
4156040	4160040	Rushing headlong through the passageway, you find yourself in a large, pinkish room.
4161040	4163040	Which I'm about to explain.
4164040	4171040	This passage has a high ceiling, from which is hanging a large, shiny, vain-looking sack of flesh in the shape of a kidney-bean.
4172040	4175040	There's several arteries run from various walls into the dangling organ,
4176040	4179040	and a huge central cord seems to be its main support coming in from the ceiling.
4180040	4185040	You can see what appear to be large, white-blue sparks with multiple limbs slowly crawling around the surface of the organ.
4186040	4189040	A greenish tangle of cords appears to be blocking the only other exit.
4192040	4197040	These spark things, usually spider things, that repair everything and also will attack us if we start pucking around.
4198040	4199040	Yeah, like an immune response or something.
4200040	4202040	Alright, so we want to attack that main cord that's holding it up there, right?
4203040	4204040	Probably.
4206040	4208040	Valisant, use your far sword and take a swipe at that cord.
4209040	4211040	I don't know if you remember, but my far sword's all used up.
4212040	4213040	I wasn't there, man.
4214040	4215040	You were there. You just forgot.
4215040	4216040	Oh.
4218040	4219040	Sorry.
4219040	4220040	I un-cheath my arrows.
4221040	4224040	I show them to Quark as they're like, hey, remember? I got it. I got the arrows.
4225040	4226040	How could I forget?
4227040	4233040	I fire a single good arrow at the thing.
4234040	4235040	At the kidney-bean?
4236040	4237040	Yep.
4238040	4239040	You miss.
4240040	4242040	By the way, there was a dude. Did you talk to the dude? He made props.
4242040	4247040	He made a mole-rein arrow. It's a double arrow.
4248040	4252040	Can I be holding it? Maybe it will make me better.
4256040	4258040	He's coming up. He made a thing.
4260040	4261040	What's your name, sir?
4262040	4263040	Luke.
4263040	4265040	Luke likes to make little props, and he made...
4266040	4271040	This is... She fires two arrows, so I made two arrows!
4273040	4274040	Adventure!
4275040	4276040	The heads of the arrows are four-sided dice.
4277040	4278040	The most dangerous of all dice.
4279040	4282040	And you also made what I thought was a joke about putting a sharpie in my butt.
4283040	4284040	It was.
4285040	4286040	Made out of sharpies.
4287040	4292040	It's a wand made out of sharpies that does ray of frost way better than ray of frost.
4293040	4294040	Great. Thank you. Was it Luke?
4295040	4296040	Thank you, Luke.
4299040	4302040	I cast a spell of thanking him.
4303040	4306040	Spencer, how far above the ground is this kidney thing hanging?
4307040	4309040	I'd say it's about ten feet above your heads.
4310040	4315040	I jump onto sharpie's shoulders and take out my flaming sword and take a swipe at the underbelly of the kidney.
4316040	4319040	Slashing at the underbelly, you score a flaming hit.
4320040	4321040	Fuck yeah!
4322040	4329040	Just as soon as the gash has been made, however, the spidery creatures I was mentioning earlier crawl over the surface of the organ.
4330040	4331040	We gotta kill those things first, then, right?
4332040	4333040	Probably.
4336040	4337040	Yeah, like AIDS.
4339040	4341040	You want us to give you beneficial AIDS?
4344040	4345040	Fuck it!
4346040	4348040	I don't have AIDS. Me fucking it doesn't give an AIDS.
4349040	4350040	That's true.
4350040	4351040	Spencer, do I have AIDS?
4352040	4353040	No.
4354040	4356040	Do I have a spell that would work on organisms like that?
4357040	4358040	Like these sparky things?
4359040	4361040	A charm person wouldn't work on that. That's for humanoids over there.
4362040	4365040	Definitely not charm person. I mean, you could probably rule out illusions.
4366040	4367040	Hypnotism will work on them.
4368040	4369040	That'd be an illusion.
4369040	4371040	I have the power to summon animals. Can I summon an AIDS monkey?
4372040	4373040	An AIDS monkey?
4375040	4376040	Can I summon some sort of like...
4377040	4380040	I should clarify, you don't have the power to summon things. Just talk to them.
4381040	4382040	So if there's a squirrel around and you're like...
4383040	4386040	I look around for AIDS-ridden animals.
4387040	4391040	Suspiciously, all AIDS-ridden animals are absent.
4393040	4394040	How convenient.
4395040	4398040	Can I shoot two arrows at the kidney?
4399040	4400040	You definitely could.
4401040	4402040	Wait, is that what I want to do?
4404040	4405040	I'm sorry?
4407040	4408040	Oh, that's...
4409040	4410040	Thanks, Hat Brothers.
4411040	4414040	I would like to shoot two arrows at the stem connecting the kidney.
4415040	4416040	What kind of arrows?
4417040	4418040	I mean, the smart...
4419040	4420040	Yeah, V arrows. Thank you, Steven.
4421040	4422040	The V arrows.
4423040	4424040	The V arrows.
4425040	4428040	One of your arrows misses its mark, planting itself right in the wall to your left.
4429040	4430040	The other one strikes in a critical fashion.
4431040	4432040	Alright!
4436040	4437040	Scoot! This is really cool.
4438040	4439040	Dealing 20 damage.
4442040	4444040	That's like a million in Dungeons and Dragons.
4445040	4448040	You notice one of the sparks goes to begin repairing the organ.
4449040	4453040	The other three drop to the ground and begin hovering towards you with menace.
4454040	4459040	I throw a throwing knife at the spark trying to repair the wound.
4460040	4465040	Okay, as you throw your throwing knife, you feel a great shock of electricity flowing through your body.
4466040	4469040	Let's see if you can still hit under this increased direction.
4470040	4471040	I should have attacked the immediate fringe.
4472040	4473040	Perhaps.
4474040	4478040	Your knife plants itself right in the back of the spidery creature and it takes...
4479040	4480040	How many damage?
4481040	4482040	Five damage.
4484040	4485040	That's a lot for a spider, right?
4486040	4487040	At the same time.
4488040	4490040	It's not bad for a spider, but we're talking lightning spiders, bro.
4490040	4497040	At the same time, the electric bolt I mentioned earlier coursing through your system deals eight damage to you.
4498040	4499040	Eight. That's nothing.
4500040	4502040	You feel quite a jolted by that.
4503040	4504040	Alright.
4505040	4506040	There you go.
4507040	4509040	Scorching ray!
4510040	4511040	At what?
4512040	4513040	Scorching ray!
4514040	4515040	What are you shooting at?
4516040	4517040	At the stem connected to the kidney.
4518040	4519040	At the damaged stem.
4521040	4522040	You miss.
4526040	4534040	The scorching ray flies into the wall and immediately blackens the surface, but quickly regenerates back to its former glory.
4535040	4540040	I climb back up on Sharpie's shoulders and I take my emerald dagger and just jab it right up in the thing.
4542040	4544040	Right up in the... Do kidneys have butts?
4545040	4546040	There's a crease somewhere.
4547040	4549040	Okay, I put it in the kidney crease.
4550040	4557040	Sliding your dagger directly into the crease of what we're considering a kidney for the purposes of this exercise.
4559040	4562040	A burst of brilliant green light flows out.
4563040	4571040	The kidney starts glowing with an intense bright light and it's not long before shimmering big rays of light are blasting out of the surface of the kidney.
4572040	4578040	You can see all the spiders are frantically trying to heal what damage is being done, but at the same time they can't keep up.
4578040	4582040	Soon you're covered in a shower of giblets as the kidney explodes.
4583040	4585040	Giblet Shower!
4586040	4590040	Twinkies! I love giblet shower!
4591040	4595040	For the next half hour, giblet shower is at 25 cents.
4596040	4597040	Toby Keith's tube blower.
4598040	4600040	Thanks for coming to Toby Keith's. I love giblet showers and grill.
4601040	4605040	Two for one giblet showers are happening at the back of the bar, front of the bar.
4605040	4608040	You can peel off the lacquer and eat it.
4609040	4613040	Line dancing's coming up, you hoochie-coochy till you smooch-a-doochie.
4614040	4619040	We're gonna play footage of weapons tests on the video wall.
4621040	4623040	All right, so did we kill this thing?
4624040	4626040	And just pray for another war.
4627040	4629040	We're just gonna get down on our knees and just pray for war.
4630040	4635040	The organ has exploded, but your actions have pissed off those things I was talking about,
4636040	4638040	and they shoot lightning towards you all.
4639040	4640040	The giblets aren't harmful, right?
4641040	4643040	The giblets are just embarrassing and gross.
4644040	4647040	I shoot two sleep arrows for a sleep.
4648040	4652040	But not before taking 12 lightning damage. Everyone.
4653040	4654040	Spencer, are we okay?
4655040	4657040	I don't know. How much HP do you have?
4658040	4659040	How much what do I have?
4660040	4662040	HP, that thing that tracks how dead you are.
4665040	4667040	I should really teach you guys how to play this at some point.
4668040	4670040	I didn't know hit points were called HP.
4671040	4672040	I thought that was a sauce you put on french fries at a pub.
4673040	4674040	Well, you do that too.
4675040	4676040	I have 27 HP.
4677040	4679040	Damn, well now you have 15.
4680040	4681040	All right, Spencer, I thought we were friends.
4682040	4684040	You can get hurt and be friends.
4684040	4686040	No, it's okay. It really seems like we're not friends right now.
4687040	4688040	I'm going to spend a lot of time together. It's fine.
4689040	4694040	I go into a rage, a barbarian rage, and I start spinning faster and faster and faster,
4695040	4700040	and I punch myself with my sword attack into the thing and try to take out as many lightning spiders as I can.
4701040	4703040	All right, let's see here. That's a tricky move.
4704040	4706040	I'm going to call that an advanced cleave action.
4707040	4708040	Yeah, that's what I call it.
4709040	4711040	You mean an ACA?
4715040	4722040	Yeah, I mean, I could have said, I could have told you I want to do an ACA, but these fuckers, they wouldn't have done it.
4723040	4725040	Man, I like your pollen head shake.
4727040	4728040	Thanks, Harry.
4730040	4733040	Swinging your sword in a circular fashion.
4734040	4736040	You strike the first spider.
4737040	4738040	Spiders everywhere.
4739040	4740040	Jeff, you're millering. You're millering.
4741040	4742040	Sorry, cha-cha.
4745040	4750040	You only managed to deal eight to the spider, but as it was already wounded from your earlier dagger,
4751040	4753040	it falls to the ground and dissipates into white energy.
4754040	4756040	The kidney nose? The kidney?
4757040	4758040	No, the kidneys already exploded.
4759040	4760040	Oh, it was giblets, yeah.
4761040	4762040	I feel bad for killing a spider.
4764040	4766040	I was in Charlotte's Web, you know.
4767040	4769040	It says crunchy.
4770040	4773040	I'd put it at Mulrain's turn.
4774040	4775040	Mulrain, you're up.
4776040	4777040	Do a thing.
4779040	4780040	I like vagueness.
4781040	4783040	I'm going to take two of my V arrows.
4784040	4785040	Nice.
4786040	4789040	I'm going to shoot them at the thing that's the best to shoot at.
4790040	4794040	You picked the best of three identical enemies to fire at.
4795040	4796040	And firing two arrows.
4797040	4798040	I shoot them as a lightning creature.
4799040	4800040	Yeah, those are the ones who are fighting.
4801040	4806040	Firing them directly at the lightning creatures, both of your arrows make their mark dealing.
4807040	4808040	And...
4810040	4812040	11 damage apiece.
4813040	4814040	The spiders are wounded.
4815040	4819040	They scuttle up the ceiling and dissipate in the ceiling.
4820040	4821040	Yay!
4822040	4824040	Kidney meters!
4826040	4828040	Who wants giblets?
4829040	4830040	Valison pipes up.
4831040	4833040	He's like, yeah, I make sandwiches out of this shit, man.
4834040	4835040	I'll take a giblet sandwich.
4836040	4838040	Hell yeah, let me get my bread of holding.
4840040	4841040	It's just regular bread.
4842040	4843040	Yeah.
4844040	4845040	I cast delicious mustard.
4846040	4847040	Nice.
4848040	4849040	It's spicily effective.
4852040	4854040	All right, well, that seems like a...
4855040	4856040	I think it's a good place to stop.
4857040	4859040	We're two thirds through the infinifish.
4864040	4865040	Come see us at the merch table.
4866040	4867040	We have a limited amount of time.
4868040	4869040	Aaron McGaffey, everybody.
4870040	4871040	Spencer Crittenden.
4872040	4873040	Spencer, stay up here, just in case.
4874040	4875040	Thank you, Luke, for my Sharpie wand.
4876040	4877040	Do you see it fits snugly into the mic stand?
4880040	4882040	Yeah, it would work perfectly for...
4883040	4884040	There's nothing...
4885040	4886040	Jeff, I think before everyone dies,
4887040	4888040	everyone needs to have a podcast
4889040	4890040	where they tell people they put something in their butt
4891040	4892040	and then have people come to the show
4893040	4894040	with things that they put in their butt
4895040	4896040	and give up to them.
4897040	4898040	Yeah, I mean, if you make that thing vibrate,
4899040	4900040	you have a legitimate sex toy there.
4901040	4903040	That's just a wonderful, goddamn dream that I'm living.
4904040	4905040	I've turned 40, I came across the country,
4906040	4907040	I crowd-surfed in Brooklyn,
4908040	4910040	and now we're at the top of the country,
4910040	4912040	the top of it, a mile above sea level,
4913040	4914040	looking down through the clouds.
4915040	4916040	Are we the highest point in the country?
4917040	4918040	No.
4919040	4920040	Highest capital.
4921040	4922040	Stretching for a record.
4924040	4925040	You know what I like, though?
4926040	4927040	It's a relief to be in a city where it's the biggest city
4928040	4929040	and to the capital.
4930040	4931040	There's so many states where you go,
4932040	4933040	it's not the capital, but it's the biggest city.
4934040	4935040	I feel like we didn't want to get to know Denver
4936040	4937040	all that well tonight.
4938040	4939040	We were kind of doing our own thing up here.
4939040	4940040	It's time to...
4941040	4942040	I want to know who's hurting the most.
4943040	4944040	I really mean that.
4945040	4946040	Who had the worst day?
4947040	4948040	Okay, this guy's kind of uncertain about it.
4949040	4950040	What's your name?
4951040	4952040	My name is Keller.
4953040	4954040	Keller? Okay, is that why?
4955040	4956040	Dan, he's hurting.
4957040	4958040	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
4959040	4960040	It was an easy joke.
4961040	4962040	There's a funny story about that.
4963040	4964040	I was at a party with someone from Switzerland,
4965040	4966040	and she asked me,
4967040	4968040	is your name really Keller?
4969040	4970040	Yeah, she was like,
4971040	4972040	you know that means basement, right?
4973040	4974040	Basement?
4975040	4976040	Like cellar? Exactly, like cellar.
4977040	4979040	Like dirty, underground, shameful...
4981040	4982040	What's a sad name?
4983040	4985040	Sad name. Sad, creepy, skeevy name.
4987040	4988040	So what happened?
4989040	4990040	What happened? What happened?
4991040	4992040	Why aren't you having a bad day?
4994040	4995040	It's kind of just the...
4996040	4998040	Well, for one, it's been like 65 years
4999040	5002040	which is a strange thing to bitch about.
5003040	5005040	It's really nice weather, and it's the end of January.
5009040	5010040	Well, I don't understand.
5011040	5012040	You're worried about global warming.
5013040	5014040	The weather's weird.
5015040	5015040	
5016040	5018040	No, I was an English major.
5019040	5021040	Okay, so what's depressing about it being 65?
5024040	5025040	It's not typical, forget that.
5026040	5027040	That was a lame thing to me, upset about.
5030040	5032040	What's the deeper trouble though, if little things like that...
5033040	5036040	I'm not joking, if little things like that bother you, like what's...
5039040	5040040	Please.
5041040	5043040	Can we talk to this lady over here because she's been very vocal.
5044040	5045040	What is your name, Miss?
5046040	5047040	Lexi.
5048040	5049040	What does that mean in Swiss?
5050040	5051040	I mean, it means worst friend ever.
5052040	5053040	You've been really...
5054040	5055040	You're really heckling your friend.
5056040	5057040	We show up the same...
5058040	5059040	We dress the same at parties.
5060040	5062040	We show up at parties wearing the same outfit.
5063040	5064040	And that's why I'm upset?
5066040	5067040	All right, come on guys.
5070040	5072040	Okay, you're a poetry major.
5073040	5074040	You got a degree in poetry.
5075040	5076040	Your name is Lex Luthor.
5078040	5079040	Keller Keller.
5080040	5081040	Keller Keller, right.
5082040	5083040	And it's warm outside.
5084040	5085040	What are we...
5086040	5087040	Today was a bad day because...
5090040	5091040	Lexi, pipe it.
5094040	5095040	So it's basically...
5096040	5097040	My issue is...
5098040	5100040	Not that I lack direction in life, it's like...
5103040	5104040	It sounds like...
5104040	5105040	Everybody, I'm sorry.
5106040	5107040	I'm sorry audience.
5110040	5112040	It's okay, I do the same thing you're doing.
5113040	5114040	In 20 minutes.
5115040	5116040	And I charge them $20.
5117040	5119040	So I was a creative writing major.
5120040	5121040	Not a poetry major, please.
5122040	5123040	Jesus.
5124040	5125040	Yeah.
5126040	5128040	I want to tell stories to people for a living,
5129040	5130040	but I have no idea how to go about that.
5131040	5132040	We're going to help you with that right now.
5133040	5134040	Fuck me, awesome.
5135040	5137040	Keller to the stage, get up here motherfucker.
5140040	5142040	Keller, we're going to give you the gift of storytelling.
5143040	5144040	Yeah, we're going to make a story.
5146040	5147040	We're going pretty long here, so we might want to move on.
5148040	5149040	Yeah, we're going to make this very quick.
5150040	5151040	This is how we're going to end.
5152040	5153040	I didn't ask him to come up.
5154040	5155040	I said, we're going to help you with that right now.
5156040	5157040	Then you said, come up.
5157040	5158040	I just think it's better to have him up, so we can all get a look at this.
5159040	5160040	Yeah, yeah. Well, look at him folks.
5170040	5172040	All right, Keller. So, let's see here.
5173040	5175040	You're struggling with how to tell a story?
5176040	5179040	In like what, like kind of a master work that you're supposed to produce for your class?
5182040	5185040	You want to be a writer, like a novelist, a screenwriter?
5186040	5187040	What do you want to be?
5188040	5189040	My aspiration is to write comics.
5190040	5192040	First of all, I'm a shitty fucking artist.
5195040	5196040	That's just the truth.
5197040	5198040	More people need to admit that, really.
5199040	5201040	Coming from the world of comics, it's heroic of you to just say,
5202040	5203040	I draw badly.
5205040	5209040	So, I want to do that, but Denver isn't a good publishing place.
5210040	5211040	I'm from Fort Collins.
5215040	5217040	Did someone say fuck Fort Collins?
5218040	5220040	Lexi, calm the fuck down.
5222040	5223040	Holy shit.
5224040	5226040	Take it easy, baby, talk about it.
5227040	5228040	I thought he'd go right up about it.
5228040	5229040	I thought he'd go right up about it.
5233040	5234040	Take it easy, Lexi.
5235040	5237040	Like we said, who had a terrible day? Keller raised his hand.
5238040	5239040	I think Lexi had a worse one for some reason.
5240040	5242040	Well, I think the reason for Keller's bad day is Lexi.
5245040	5246040	I think, where did you drive her from?
5247040	5248040	From Fort Collins.
5249040	5250040	With Lexi in the back seat?
5251040	5252040	Oh, thank Christ.
5253040	5254040	She's like, that's a dumb gas station.
5255040	5256040	Oh, it's crazy.
5256040	5257040	Everyone's hair's on fire.
5258040	5259040	Just kidding.
5260040	5261040	Not two and ten, but three and nine.
5262040	5263040	All right.
5264040	5267040	I'm desperately trying to figure out how to turn a conversation with you
5268040	5269040	into a hilarious improvised bit.
5270040	5272040	That's my math on the table.
5274040	5278040	So, you write comics, like you're from Fort Collins, you're in Denver,
5279040	5281040	you want to write comics, you're bad at drawing,
5282040	5285040	and you're looking for a story so good that it would make a great comic book, right?
5286040	5287040	Always.
5288040	5289040	Okay, all right.
5290040	5291040	So, what's your favorite thing ever?
5292040	5293040	Bananas.
5294040	5295040	Okay.
5296040	5298040	And what was your mom's name?
5299040	5300040	Samantha?
5301040	5302040	No, what's your mom's name?
5303040	5304040	What's your mom's name?
5305040	5306040	Ellen.
5307040	5308040	That means Attic.
5311040	5312040	And your favorite movie?
5313040	5314040	Ah, fuck.
5315040	5316040	Just a favorite movie.
5317040	5318040	American Astronaut.
5319040	5320040	What? Okay.
5321040	5322040	All right. Tell her, everybody.
5323040	5324040	American Astronaut's his favorite movie.
5325040	5326040	He's a comic artist.
5328040	5330040	He's looking for the perfect story.
5331040	5332040	His name means seller.
5333040	5335040	And here is his biopic.
5336040	5337040	Bananas!
5338040	5339040	Catch a bananas!
5340040	5342040	I really like one of those bananas.
5343040	5344040	All right.
5345040	5346040	Be careful. These aren't regular bananas.
5347040	5350040	These bananas will give you everything you possibly could want,
5351040	5352040	but it comes at a terrible, terrible price.
5353040	5355040	Okay. Well, I don't want... I just want to know...
5356040	5357040	I just want to have the banana.
5358040	5360040	Can I explain something to you? I'm a writer.
5361040	5363040	I'm a banana salesman.
5364040	5365040	I just need to use...
5366040	5368040	I sell mythical bananas, and I don't have all day to talk with people like this.
5369040	5370040	I'll take three of them.
5370040	5371040	Okay.
5372040	5373040	That'll be four dollars.
5374040	5375040	There you go. All right.
5376040	5378040	All right. I'm going back to my basement where I live.
5379040	5380040	Okay.
5381040	5383040	Remember, Keller, I named you basement,
5384040	5386040	so you would never get ahead in life.
5389040	5391040	Oh, you bitch, Ellen.
5394040	5396040	All right. I got to try to draw this comic book.
5397040	5398040	Stupid!
5399040	5400040	Oh.
5402040	5403040	Totally stupid!
5404040	5405040	Lexi.
5406040	5409040	Lexi, I didn't know you were down here. I'm trying to draw a comic book.
5410040	5411040	Oh, Lexi, honestly, I...
5412040	5414040	You insinuate yourself into my life.
5418040	5421040	Oh, God, she's dead. Oh, God, there's a dart in her neck.
5422040	5424040	Oh, God, it's a... it's a pinch of dirt.
5425040	5426040	Banana man came back.
5427040	5429040	Yes. I told you those were cursed.
5430040	5433040	Everyone that you love will die within 35 seconds of meeting them.
5434040	5435040	Because you shot her with a banana dart.
5436040	5437040	Right.
5438040	5441040	Is it a curse, or do you just kill people that are your customers?
5442040	5443040	It's my curse. I'm a murderer.
5445040	5447040	Seems like good story material. Bye-bye.
5448040	5449040	It is good story material.
5450040	5453040	I hate to be ghoulish, but I've never had a better idea.
5453040	5456040	Oh, maybe I could stop trying to draw things and just write an idea.
5457040	5458040	I'm a ghost of Lexi!
5459040	5462040	Lexi, you dying is the best thing that's ever happened to you.
5464040	5465040	I'm going to Comic-Con.
5466040	5468040	No, you can't! That's stupid! It's stupid! You can't do it!
5469040	5471040	You say that about everything. Now it doesn't matter.
5473040	5476040	Oh, she got killed by a ghost? Even they hate her ghost world.
5477040	5478040	Banana man could kill ghosts, too.
5480040	5482040	Three months later at Comic-Con...
5483040	5486040	So you see my ideas about a girl who gets shot by a ghost dart.
5487040	5490040	And I have an indistinguishable accent.
5491040	5494040	It's part Austrian, part Asperger's.
5496040	5502040	I put it all into my work, and it's crazy. It's 65 degrees today, and it just drove me nuts!
5505040	5508040	So I'm hoping that you will buy this as Stan Lee.
5511040	5512040	I like it, kid.
5513040	5514040	Excelsior!
5516040	5518040	It's in the way that she uses...
5519040	5520040	credits!
5521040	5522040	credits!
5524040	5526040	Outtakes next to the credits.
5527040	5531040	Oh, no, a dart went in your neck. I don't know what I'm going to fool.
5532040	5533040	Fool? I mean, duel.
5534040	5535040	That's stupid! I'm stupid!
5536040	5537040	Lexi, okay.
5538040	5539040	Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
5540040	5542040	That was Keller's movie. Keller's story.
5544040	5547040	Keller's, Keller's, Keller's biopic.
5548040	5550040	That was entitled, The Final Panel.
5551040	5556040	There's a deleted scene that involves an astronaut man, or whatever his favorite movie is.
5557040	5559040	His favorite movie? Some fucked up, weird Swedish film.
5560040	5561040	No one gives a shit about Keller.
5562040	5564040	Why don't you watch Die Hard for once in your life?
5565040	5566040	Harry Potter 3. Look it up.
5567040	5571040	I like the American astronaut. That's why weather fucks with you, because it's normal.
5574040	5576040	You're separating yourself from everything normal.
5577040	5580040	Oh, it's 65 degrees. Oh, it makes my skin itch, because it's normal.
5581040	5585040	I hate when it gets hot again in LA, because I like to wear suits, and I like the chilly weather.
5586040	5588040	I like sweater weather. Now it's getting hot again, so you're screwed, right?
5589040	5590040	That's what you're saying.
5591040	5593040	I love the fact that I don't have a sweater.
5594040	5595040	Yeah?
5597040	5598040	All right.
5599040	5600040	Jesus Christ.
5601040	5604040	Please tell me you all lived together in one apartment.
5605040	5607040	It's kind of like shallow grave, like it's like some indie movie.
5608040	5612040	They all find a case of heroin, and they're all poetry majors, and they just end up all dead at the end.
5613040	5616040	Well, I think mission accomplished. We dove out in the audience, and we really...
5617040	5619040	I think we really got the real taste of Denver from that.
5621040	5623040	There's a little bell pepper, a little ham.
5624040	5625040	Yeah.
5626040	5627040	I think everyone else in the audience was like,
5627040	5630040	Yeah, I'm glad you talked to Keller and Lexi.
5631040	5636040	I wish you... I was hoping you'd talk to me, but that's pretty much par for the course.
5637040	5640040	Denver, it's the altitude. It'll be good.
5641040	5644040	You played guitar in Nashville, and you talked to Keller and Lexi.
5647040	5650040	All right, Harmon. I think it's time to bring this train right into the station.
5651040	5652040	And talk about what we learned?
5653040	5654040	So sad.
5655040	5656040	I don't want to leave here either.
5657040	5658040	We're going to the bus right after we leave.
5659040	5661040	We can stay and drink for a little bit, but we're leaving at 2 a.m.
5662040	5663040	I don't get to see the town at all.
5664040	5665040	Believe me, we'd stay here forever.
5666040	5668040	But you know we can't hide your cheese sticks, everybody.
5669040	5670040	He's coming.
5672040	5674040	When your city is high,
5675040	5678040	you just roll downtown
5679040	5681040	to go to Harvard Town.
5682040	5684040	I was in a wagon.
5685040	5687040	We played Dungeons & Dragons.
5688040	5691040	I went to Denver and found my heart.
5693040	5695040	And, tatatoes kids make me fart.
5696040	5698040	So I'm walking it around the room.
5699040	5702040	Crop dusting it like baby from a wolf.
5703040	5704040	And I'm...
5705040	5708040	I'm hoping that if I keep walking it'll trail behind.
5709040	5712040	And I'm sorry if it gets in your nose.
5713040	5715040	But in Denver that's how it goes.
5716040	5719040	And I hope the altitude makes the dudes not smell it.
5720040	5722040	I'm sorry that I'm singing about hearts.
5723040	5725040	I should be singing about hearts.
5726040	5728040	I should be singing about omelets.
5729040	5732040	Lexer and Schooley and whatever your names were.
5733040	5734040	Weird hipsters.
5735040	5737040	And what about Dave and his cheese sticks
5738040	5740040	and Kelsey and her kite.
5740040	5742040	We're at our kite and I'm not making shit up.
5743040	5744040	You're a great city.
5744040	5746040	You're the best city in the entire country.
5748040	5751040	You're so good I'm gonna change your name to Armantown.
5751040	5753040	And we're gonna go to the moon.
5753040	5756040	We're gonna secede from the Union soon.
5756040	5761040	We're gonna fuck this country and fuck Toby Keith in the eye.
5762040	5764040	Fuck that guy.
5765040	5767040	His drinks are overpriced.
5768040	5770040	Margaritas don't even taste that nice.
5770040	5773040	He puts too much salt on the rim.
5773040	5775040	I think that drives me nuts.
5776040	5778040	Fuck you Toby Keith in your butts.
5780040	5783040	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
5783040	5788040	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5788040	5791040	This sock can use a structural tweak or two.
5792040	5798040	Armantown where he is yellow and the boob is brown.
5798040	5801040	I fuck your mama in Armantown.
5801040	5805040	Look at Raquel, tip her ass, she's got nice hair.
5805040	5807040	Thank you so much Jen for improv.
5807040	5808040	Thank you.

5820040	5821040	Crowd surfing.
5821040	5822040	God dammit.
5822040	5823040	It's the altitude.
5823040	5824040	Oh shit, I'm touching.
5824040	5826040	I just, Lexi get over here.
5826040	5828040	Ah Lexi, bend a hand.
5830040	5831040	Crowd surfing.
5831040	5832040	Here we go.
5832040	5833040	Crowd surfing.
5833040	5834040	Crowd surfing.
5836040	5839040	I'm over one mile above sea level.
5840040	5844040	I'm 5,283 feet jump.
5844040	5846040	Crowd surfing.
5846040	5847040	Crowd surfing.
5847040	5849040	Oh my god, oh my god.
5849040	5851040	My ass isn't a plate of calamari.
5851040	5852040	Oh god.
5852040	5853040	Oh shit.
5853040	5854040	Oh fuck.
5854040	5857040	Rob Schneider's here next week, folks.
5857040	5860040	Thank you JJ for coming up and bringing us back in.
5860040	5862040	Thank you Luke for the arrows.
5862040	5863040	Thank you guys.
5863040	5864040	It was Kelly.
5864040	5865040	Kelly and Lexi.
5865040	5868040	Whoa.
5869040	5872040	One more time for Spencer everybody.
5873040	5876040	Here at the Cathy, I'm Jeff Davis.
5876040	5878040	One more time.
5878040	5879040	The mayor of Harbin Town.
5879040	5881040	He made it through even to his elevation.
5881040	5883040	Ted Harbin.
5883040	5885040	Jeff Davis returns.
5885040	5886040	His comptroller.
5886040	5889040	I'm sorry they ate so much this month.
5896040	5897040	Thank you all.
5897040	5899040	There's merchandise over there in the corner.
5899040	5900040	Let's all go to Tubby Kids for real.
5900040	5902040	The place is delicious.
5902040	5903040	And the savings.
5906040	5907040	For the trips.
5907040	5913040	The fun you have per paragraph in the name of the place is like the highest ratio of fun you'll ever have.
5937040	5939040	Thank you.
