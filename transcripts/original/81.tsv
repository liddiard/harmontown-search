0	22280	Hello everyone and welcome once again to Meltdown Comics, the Nerd Melt Theater.
23280	32280	Harman Town is now in session. Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
46280	50280	Jeff. Yes, Dan? We got a guest tree growing in the back.
50280	53280	Our green room was chock full of nuts.
53280	61280	Yeah, it's chock full of nuts. So let's get anything we got to say about me being fat, jerking off, and whatever.
61280	64280	You're getting a little rounder.
64280	72280	Alright, I'm fat, I jerk off, I put some stuff in my butt once, I'm into women with the pantyhose.
72280	73280	Bubble baths?
73280	83280	Bubble baths, love to take bubble baths, hate NBC, hate Tony, love, love, love 12 year olds in the back of my white van.
83280	87280	Rape, rape, hilarious, hilarious rape!
87280	89280	We can end the show right now.
89280	94280	Yeah, well that concludes 20% of you can run off, go and blog.
94280	97280	But we got guests to talk about.
97280	98280	I'm excited.
98280	109280	I'm excited about both of them really. One of whom we teased earlier because she wasn't here and her Mr. Clean bouncer in the back kept going,
109280	118280	No! She's here, she's actually here. No idea what we'll talk to her about, but I'm excited that she's here because she's part of comedy history.
118280	126280	And then another fellow who I'm also excited about because he's like the version of me that's actually read about the things that I pretend I'm interested in.
126280	136280	So I don't know where to start. Let's talk about you. Where'd you get that suit? Who cares?
136280	140280	I was just about to tell you the rich history of the suit.
140280	142280	You got anything going on?
142280	151280	Me? You know, Dan, I'm just living a happy life. I've traveled a lot recently and I'm home and I don't leave again until we leave together for Scotland.
151280	161280	Oh, that's nice. Okay. I have a lot of anxiety about working on Community and it's like I've burrowed into this mud hole.
161280	163280	Community is a television joke?
163280	171280	Yeah. And I have no idea. I'm at this point, my compass needle's spinning with the quality of the show. It doesn't matter. Who will ever know?
171280	179280	That's whatever. That's my shtick. I have no idea. It could be the best, could be worst. Who cares? No one ever wanted me to... Who cares, Dan?
179280	184280	How you feel about how good your show is or bad or stupid. It's a sitcom. Just shut up.
184280	197280	But I'm in that zone where I'm like, I don't know. That's been like six months and I keep thinking I'm going to finish and then we're going to go off to Scotland in between Aaron's birthday.
197280	199280	It's coming up very soon.
199280	202280	Is that a couple weeks, what?
202280	204280	It's December 5th is Aaron's birthday.
204280	205280	Same as my brother?
205280	206280	Same as my dad.
206280	209280	What? Really?
209280	210280	My brother...
210280	217280	I propose a fan fiction story involving you and I at an 1800s orgy.
217280	223280	I'm almost certain that already exists.
223280	225280	In which we became our own grandfathers.
225280	229280	Is there a slash porn of you out on the Internet right now?
229280	236280	I've never seen anything on the Internet that involved me doing it.
236280	244280	There has to be. Because there's lots of slash of me because of Who's Lion. The Who's Lion fans love it. I'm fucking Ryan McCallum.
244280	245280	You don't like it.
245280	250280	I mean, no. Because here's why. Poorly written.
250280	256280	Would you like me to write some slash porn? Would you like me to knock it out of the park?
256280	264280	That's not where I was going with it, but yes, I would. I would like you to write some really good me and Greg Proob slash.
264280	268280	All right. Well, I'll work on that. I've got to sit down. I've got to improvise it.
268280	271280	I'll give you a better challenge. Me and you slash. Slash it up between you and me.
271280	275280	If that doesn't exist, I'm shocked. I don't know what we have to do to make it happen.
275280	284280	If somebody did artwork of me and Dustin Marshall, our podcast producer, I'd just really gain it up.
284280	291280	I saw some really flattering, like actually probably years ago when we first started doing Harmontown,
291280	297280	I saw some really flattering serialized fan fiction that wasn't slash. It was just fan fiction.
297280	302280	It was about just our exploits. It was just me hanging out and then you hanging out.
302280	311280	I don't know. I was having misadventures and things, but somebody sent me a link one time and you read the first couple of lines and it was me and Colin Mockery on a cruise ship.
311280	317280	And then it instantly turns into just sucking and fucking. I would welcome any of it.
317280	323280	The reason I can't really read the community stuff because I think I've explained this enough.
323280	336280	The reason is because of scientific craftsmanship. Because if you were to write a community fanfic story about Annie finds a Rubik's Cube and there's a butt inside of it and it farts in her face.
336280	343280	If I were to mention Rubik's Cubes in an episode or something, we have to keep those worlds separate otherwise.
343280	352280	What am I supposed to do? What could I do? Would you want to have sent me something and then be the reason why I couldn't do that episode?
352280	361280	Or would you want to be sitting there wondering if I ripped you off? The only possible thing I can do is not deal with it.
361280	372280	Thank you, Dan. I was hoping he would talk for 10 minutes straight about why he can't read fan fiction.
372280	382280	Now for our next segment, me cutting myself and then drinking it and then complaining about the taste and spitting into a cup and then tearing the cup and then cutting myself the charge of the cup.
382280	392280	Where'd you get this new cardigan? Aaron got this for me and it's monogrammed but they got the monogram wrong.
392280	402280	What's it say? D-H-G? D-H-G? They got that monogram wrong? But it's still a monogram sweater, man.
402280	408280	Somebody murdered Gathy. She added Dan Harmon Gathy.
408280	417280	Let's start bringing up our friends. I think I'm trying to figure out what order to bring them up in to maximize the impact.
417280	420280	Height.
420280	427280	Height's been suggested. Water displacement.
427280	437280	I'm going to bring them up in order of how... First we're going to do our feral audio. No, fuck that. No. I'm going counterintuitive. Fuck you.
437280	438280	Do it.
438280	439280	I'm going off the rails.
439280	440280	Follow your heart.
440280	441280	I'm following my heart.
441280	442280	Slash it up.
442280	443280	I'm bringing Lorraine Newman up first.
443280	446280	Lorraine Newman!
446280	454280	Lorraine Newman to the stage.
454280	459280	You can sit anywhere and take any mic. It doesn't matter.
459280	464280	No, you don't have to move down.
464280	470280	It's the future. There's no more rules. Just sit anywhere you want.
470280	473280	No idea what to talk to you about. That's one of the new things.
473280	476280	Well, we could talk about public bathrooms.
476280	481280	We were talking about that in the green room. I said, is there anything in your mind emotionally?
481280	486280	You want to have a word with... But it sounded like your husband is one of these people.
486280	487280	No, it's women.
487280	492280	But your husband, in the meantime, in the men's room, he said...
492280	496280	I think it was the next guest who talked about the gap.
497280	499280	I didn't hear what my husband said.
499280	506280	You know how deafness, male deafness, tunes out the pitch that's women's voices?
506280	510280	I'm kidding, honey.
510280	512280	I really didn't hear what he said.
512280	515280	You said in the green room you wouldn't mind talking about this.
515280	518280	You called it the ski position.
518280	522280	The women that think you can catch something from a toilet seat, so they hover.
522280	526280	You can't catch something from a toilet seat, but I end up sitting in your piss.
526280	528280	And it makes me hate you.
528280	531280	You don't want germs, so you're not going to sit on the toilet seat.
531280	535280	You're going to be the Nikola Tesla of peeing in a public bathroom.
535280	539280	Lorraine, you're saying women hover so high that they piss all over the seat?
539280	542280	They don't even have to hover high, but they still piss on the seat.
542280	543280	Really?
543280	549280	No matter how much you put to cover the seat, it still comes through, and I end up sitting in their pee.
550280	552280	Does that force you to hover as well?
552280	554280	No, I refuse to hover.
554280	557280	You'd rather sit in strangers' pee than hover.
557280	561280	Well, there are times when it's deceiving, because you've laid something down.
561280	562280	Right.
562280	564280	And often you can't see it because of the lighting.
564280	565280	Yeah.
565280	568280	But then it's like, you!
568280	570280	I'm with Lorraine.
570280	577280	I think that that's the last field of battle amongst each other.
577280	586280	If we cannot touch with our asses the same piece of plastic, what are we even doing?
587280	588280	It's the end of civilization.
588280	593280	Until some scientist says, there's a germ that goes from your vagina and your butthole
593280	597280	onto a piece of plastic and waits in a mall and jumps up into you.
597280	598280	It can live!
598280	603280	By the way, no one's going in a bathroom before that thing has taken us all out.
603280	604280	Right.
604280	605280	Exactly.
605280	608280	So until then, it's an altar.
608280	611280	When you go into a public bathroom, you have a choice.
611280	614280	And the people that have come before you, they've made a choice.
614280	615280	Exactly.
615280	618280	And they have changed the surface of the altar.
618280	624280	And your husband, God bless his soul, but he is one of the enemy.
625280	628280	He said he leans forward when he makes a poo-poo.
628280	631280	Wait, what?
631280	632280	He leans forward.
632280	633280	He leans forward.
633280	634280	To what end?
634280	636280	To his end.
636280	641280	And when I heard him describe it, I suddenly understood so many of the things that I have
641280	643280	sometimes seen in a stall.
643280	644280	Wait, wait.
644280	645280	Leans forward to make a poo-poo.
645280	646280	So that you're not touching everything.
646280	647280	Well, I'm not touching this.
647280	652280	So that you're trying to split the difference, like you're on a fucking bench leaning forward.
652280	656280	I am not touching this part of the conversation.
656280	662280	Let's move on to the people who are loading their cars at the market, but they're not
662280	665280	telling you that they're not leaving when you're waiting for their spot.
665280	666280	Oh, yeah.
666280	667280	Yeah.
667280	668280	How about them?
668280	669280	Right?
669280	670280	Right?
670280	671280	What do you mean?
671280	672280	Right?
672280	677280	There needs to be some sort of public pact where if you're not leaving, like signal that
677280	678280	something.
678280	679280	Exactly.
679280	680280	Be a human being.
680280	681280	Wait, loading their cars.
681280	682280	Like groceries or something?
682280	684280	If you're putting stuff in your car, let's say you're at the market and you're putting
684280	687280	groceries in your car, but also you have to go to the dry cleaner next door or something
687280	688280	like that.
688280	689280	Right.
689280	690280	And you're not getting in your car.
690280	691280	And you can see that someone's waiting for your spot.
691280	692280	And people don't say...
692280	693280	I've lost Dan.
693280	694280	I can see it.
694280	696280	I've lost him completely.
696280	699280	Dan's not big on social cues, like...
699280	701280	No, but I...
701280	703280	No, if I'm in my...
703280	706280	If I get into my car and I...
706280	708280	No, the meters are running.
708280	713280	If I feel like someone might be thinking that I'm going to leave the spot and stuff,
713280	715280	no, I'm very paranoid about that.
715280	723280	My biggest nightmare, hands down, second only to Bucket of Spiders on the Face, is the public
723280	728280	movie theater Save Me a Seat.
728280	730280	I'll be right there.
730280	732280	Save Me a Seat.
732280	733280	Sold out movie.
733280	737280	I got to sit next to an empty seat.
737280	739280	Or two, or three.
739280	741280	Sometimes there's three of you coming.
741280	742280	Save us a seat.
742280	745280	I can't say no, because there's no...
745280	746280	I'm so with you.
746280	747280	What kind of dick move is that?
747280	748280	I'm so with you.
748280	756280	I got to spend the 20 minutes of trivia slides about David Hasselhoff before the movie, where
756280	757280	people are...
757280	758280	Sweat.
758280	762280	People that, by the way, now history shows, will sometimes pull out an assault rifle and
762280	765280	shoot you, are looking for seats in the movie theater.
765280	766280	That's not why.
766280	767280	That's not why.
767280	768280	That's not why.
768280	769280	That's not why.
769280	770280	That's not...
770280	775280	I have never assumed that that would be the case, but what terrifies me...
775280	779280	And going, it's seat taken.
779280	781280	I'm cheating.
781280	782280	Everyone wants to sit.
782280	783280	You know what you do in that case.
783280	787280	If you're forced into that situation, because again, yeah, you can't say, no, I won't save
787280	788280	you a seat.
789280	790280	But what you do...
790280	796280	A friend of mine, a comedian, Ted Davis, he said, on a plane or in a movie theater, when
796280	800280	you have to save a seat, just affect a really wet cough.
800280	801280	That's good.
801280	804280	And just cough a lot, then nobody wants those seats.
804280	805280	Yeah, yeah.
805280	808280	Or a variety of props could help out in that situation.
808280	810280	But in reality...
810280	813280	Which props would help out the most?
813280	817280	Well, like, you take these googly glasses, and these are what I call my mile highs.
817280	818280	I don't know.
820280	821280	It's an audio podcast.
821280	825280	Just imagine I'm wearing a prop that physically makes sense, a person next to you wouldn't
825280	826280	want to...
826280	828280	You ever want to scare a librarian?
830280	838280	Lorraine Newman, 1975, you're on a variety comedy show that is not supposed to, I assume,
838280	839280	succeed.
839280	841280	Or they wouldn't have put it on at midnight on NBC.
841280	842280	Right.
842280	844280	It was supposed to replace the...
844280	846280	Instead of the Carson reruns.
846280	847280	And it's live.
847280	848280	It's a filler, yeah.
848280	849280	Meaning...
849280	852280	Not meaning amazing.
852280	855280	What is it now, 40 years later?
855280	857280	I can't even keep track of time.
857280	863280	But 42 years later, every fucking sketch is archived in this computer control.
863280	868280	There's a robot arm that goes, dick in a box, goes, October 2012.
868280	870280	Why would that be in October?
870280	871280	There's a Christmas sketch.
871280	872280	But...
873280	882280	But back in these days of Coneheads and these things, you guys were doing this variety show
882280	883280	for...
883280	884280	For us.
884280	885280	Yeah.
885280	890280	You were Bell Bottom Jeans and it was...
890280	892280	I don't have a question because I'm a bad interviewer.
892280	895280	I'm curious if you have any insight, any...
895280	897280	Well, you want me to set the stage?
897280	898280	Sure.
898280	899280	Okay.
900280	907280	Well, the first people who were hired in the cast were actually me and Gilda.
907280	909280	And I had worked with Lorne before.
909280	911280	I had done a Lily Tomlin special.
911280	914280	And I think that was in 74.
914280	917280	And he had seen me in the Groundlings.
917280	921280	And then he came back and saw me doing more characters and more material.
921280	922280	Who is he?
922280	923280	Lorne.
923280	924280	Okay.
924280	926280	And I went to New York and I met Gilda.
926280	928280	And then we watched other people's auditions.
928280	929280	Yeah.
929280	930280	Yeah.
930280	931280	And then I met Danny.
931280	934280	With him because he was like, you're my Charlie's Angels.
934280	935280	Let's go assemble.
935280	936280	Exactly.
936280	937280	Exactly.
937280	938280	That's what we felt like.
938280	941280	And that was interesting.
941280	944280	And then we started filming the commercial parodies.
944280	946280	And that's where I met Blue Shee.
946280	951280	And Howard Shore, who was our band leader, who has now become an Academy Award-winning...
951280	952280	Lord of the Rings.
952280	953280	Yeah.
953280	957280	I mean, you know, actually Silence of the Lambs too.
957280	958280	Fuck that.
958280	959280	Wait, Lorraine.
959280	962280	So whose auditions did you watch that made it into the cast?
962280	963280	Jane Curtin.
963280	964280	Wow.
964280	966280	And it was between her and Mimi Kennedy.
966280	968280	Do you know who she is?
968280	969280	No.
969280	970280	Oh, God.
970280	971280	I wish I could list her credits now.
971280	972280	You'd go, oh, my God.
972280	973280	Yeah.
973280	974280	Her.
974280	975280	She was really good.
975280	976280	But Jane, it was just clear.
976280	977280	So Lorne had the women first?
977280	978280	I think so.
978280	979280	Yeah.
979280	980280	And I think he did have Danny, actually.
980280	982280	And Chevy was hired as a writer.
982280	985280	Garrett Morris was hired as a writer.
985280	988280	And I met Tom Schiller, who was also a writer.
988280	991280	And I'm thinking, God, that guy looks familiar.
991280	996280	It turned out that we'd gone to the same grammar school, and my sister had been his camp counselor.
996280	999280	So, you know, that was interesting.
999280	1006280	It's already surprising to me, because I remember from what I've read, like, you guys were all...
1006280	1011280	I picture you guys as being all sort of in the same company.
1011280	1014280	Like, it was like Second City or something.
1014280	1017280	And there's somebody coming and scouting and just grabbing people.
1017280	1019280	Well, the groundlings had just...
1019280	1025280	We had just formed the groundlings like a year before I went to New York to do the show.
1025280	1028280	I was the first groundling to go and do SNL.
1028280	1032280	So I cannot tell you the teasing I got from everybody in the cast.
1032280	1037280	Well, mainly Danny and John about the groundlings.
1037280	1042280	So, no, it was Second City from Toronto, Second City from Chicago.
1042280	1047280	You guys, when you were showing up in 75, when you were shooting the first...
1047280	1051280	Can you remember the first sketch?
1051280	1056280	Yeah, well, I also remember the first sketch that was cut on George Carlin's show,
1056280	1060280	which was Alexander the Great's High School Reunion.
1060280	1062280	And it was so funny.
1062280	1066280	And I wasn't even in it, but I was heartbroken that it was cut.
1066280	1069280	And, you know, there have been a lot of instances like that,
1069280	1073280	including, I think it was Jesus Christ's High School Reunion,
1073280	1076280	where it was, Jesus, is that you? God, you look good.
1076280	1079280	Christ, it's good to see you.
1079280	1081280	No.
1081280	1086280	What was the joke at Alexander the Great's High School Reunion?
1086280	1088280	Oh, that I don't remember.
1088280	1090280	It was such a long time ago.
1090280	1092280	Just trust me.
1092280	1094280	Trust me, it was funny.
1094280	1096280	So you left the Groundlings in what year?
1096280	1098280	75.
1098280	1101280	When I was... I was born in 73. When I was four or five years old,
1101280	1104280	my first professional job was at the Groundlings Theatre. I did a play there.
1104280	1105280	Really?
1105280	1107280	Yeah. So it would have been just a couple of years after you left.
1107280	1108280	Wow.
1108280	1111280	I was in a very ill-advised production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,
1111280	1114280	with all children.
1114280	1116280	Real children.
1116280	1118280	It was a bummer.
1118280	1119280	Wow.
1120280	1122280	Opening night, I was Linus,
1122280	1125280	and my director, who was like six foot five,
1125280	1127280	and I was a little tiny four-year-old,
1127280	1130280	and he gets down on his knees, on his haunches,
1130280	1132280	in the wings right before I walk on.
1132280	1133280	He was like,
1133280	1134280	Jeffrey, are you okay?
1134280	1136280	I'm like, yeah, why?
1136280	1138280	He's like, you don't look so good.
1138280	1140280	And I just puked all over.
1140280	1143280	I just projectile vomited all over his face,
1143280	1147280	and then I dropped my blanket and went out on stage.
1148280	1150280	As I think I said before, if you're Linus,
1150280	1152280	and you don't have a blanket, you're Schroeder.
1152280	1155280	Nobody fucking knows who you are.
1155280	1158280	That's some pep talk.
1158280	1159280	That's a great pep talk.
1159280	1160280	Yeah, that's good.
1160280	1162280	I owe that guy a drink.
1162280	1163280	And you were on SNL.
1163280	1164280	Now we call it SNL.
1164280	1166280	I never called it SNL back then.
1166280	1169280	Well, at that time, it was NBC's Saturday Night,
1169280	1172280	because Howard Cosell had a show on Friday night
1172280	1175280	with his rep company, Chris Guest.
1175280	1177280	A lot of other interesting people.
1177280	1179280	What was the Howard Cosell show called?
1179280	1180280	It was Saturday Night.
1180280	1181280	Oh, okay.
1181280	1182280	All right.
1182280	1186280	So anyways, you did it for, what, five years?
1186280	1187280	Five years, yeah.
1187280	1191280	Like, how many episodes would that be?
1191280	1193280	I think it was 105 shows.
1193280	1195280	Jesus Christ.
1195280	1200280	And then Lorne decided he'd had enough.
1200280	1203280	You were there, so you departed,
1203280	1206280	there was that year that then Lorne Michaels
1206280	1209280	got removed from his own NBC show.
1209280	1210280	Is that what happened?
1210280	1211280	Yeah, something like that.
1211280	1212280	When he told us he quit.
1212280	1213280	I remember reading something.
1213280	1214280	Dan, where are you going with this?
1214280	1215280	I don't know.
1215280	1219280	No, no, I really wasn't going with that.
1219280	1221280	But was that 80?
1221280	1222280	Yes, that's 80.
1222280	1223280	And so you left like...
1223280	1224280	Whole cast left.
1224280	1229280	Like Lorne came to call you guys together and go...
1229280	1231280	I'm interviewing you about stuff that everyone can read
1231280	1232280	and some paper back somewhere.
1232280	1235280	Dick Ebersole, or was it Dick Ebersole?
1235280	1237280	Someone from the network came and asked us
1237280	1241280	if we wanted to stay, knowing that Lorne was leaving.
1241280	1243280	Because Jean Dumanian, who had been, I think,
1243280	1246280	the talent coordinator, was going to take over
1246280	1248280	as the producer.
1248280	1253280	And we didn't feel that she could do it.
1253280	1256280	So we all left.
1256280	1257280	And I was homesick.
1257280	1258280	I wanted to come home to LA.
1258280	1261280	After five years of working on a show, even if you thought
1261280	1263280	that the next person would do a bang-up job,
1263280	1265280	it's like, it's a good time to leave.
1265280	1266280	Yeah.
1266280	1267280	Yeah, you can't be faulted for it.
1267280	1269280	Lorraine, what was your relationship with Chevy?
1269280	1270280	Because Dan has worked with Chevy
1270280	1274280	and they've had kind of a famous newsworthy relationship.
1274280	1276280	It was the last thing that we said in the green room.
1276280	1277280	It was like, oh, the Chevy connection.
1277280	1278280	Oh, Jesus.
1278280	1279280	We're not going to talk about it.
1279280	1282280	Yeah, I was friends with Chevy.
1282280	1284280	We had a really great friendship.
1284280	1286280	And when he left the show,
1286280	1287280	I continued to be friends with Chevy.
1287280	1291280	You were notably the only person from Saturday Night Live,
1291280	1296280	unless I'm mistaken, when he did that roast on Comedy Central.
1296280	1300280	You were the one alumni, alumnum, alumnus.
1300280	1302280	Alumnum.
1302280	1305280	You did a very funny bit that you read from your diary
1305280	1307280	of having worked with Chevy.
1307280	1309280	But you were the only person there.
1309280	1313280	The story surrounding that thing is that he was pretty bummed out.
1313280	1314280	He actually described it.
1314280	1315280	Oh, it was awful.
1315280	1320280	It was really, I mean, you know, his speech,
1320280	1324280	you know, when he comes up afterwards, was just, they cut most of it.
1324280	1330280	And they had to, because it was basically, there was no material.
1330280	1335280	Usually they have a bit where they roast the people that roasted them.
1335280	1338280	But his was off the cuff.
1338280	1344280	And it was just basically saying fuck you to everybody else, you know.
1344280	1350280	And people who had artfully crafted a piece, you know.
1350280	1355280	And he said, I'm only doing this because it's benefiting my wife's favorite charity.
1355280	1356280	Right.
1356280	1359280	So, yeah.
1359280	1362280	But is there something, you and I, it's like,
1362280	1366280	I literally ran up into the stage because we had that one moment right before,
1366280	1368280	I was like, oh, Chevy, oh shit.
1368280	1372280	I think you and I get the sense, you and I feel the same way,
1372280	1374280	which is like, no good can come of.
1374280	1378280	There's no shit talk to be done.
1378280	1382280	He is a fucking fascinating person.
1382280	1386280	And I worked with him longer than you did,
1386280	1389280	not to pull any rank or anything.
1389280	1392280	But I've actually worked with him longer than anybody,
1392280	1395280	which I sometimes marvel at looking back on.
1395280	1401280	Like he, so magnificent.
1401280	1403280	Such an unignorable person.
1403280	1406280	To tell you a story about the time that I broke my ribs.
1406280	1410280	Does anybody, have anybody here broken their ribs?
1410280	1411280	Anybody?
1411280	1412280	Only once.
1412280	1413280	She's laughing at Chevy Chase.
1413280	1414280	It hurts like hell.
1414280	1415280	It takes forever to heal.
1415280	1416280	It is excruciating.
1416280	1417280	And you can't sneeze and you can't cough.
1417280	1418280	You can't breathe.
1418280	1419280	You can't sit up and you can't lay down.
1419280	1420280	You can't do anything.
1420280	1421280	So forget laughing.
1421280	1422280	Okay.
1422280	1423280	All right.
1423280	1428280	Now it's a shame that they didn't include Chevy in the aristocrats documentary
1428280	1432280	because he tells it probably the funniest of anybody else
1432280	1434280	because he acts it out.
1434280	1436280	The aristocrats joke.
1436280	1440280	He actually shits in your mouth.
1440280	1442280	Well, there's two of them.
1442280	1446280	One is, I think there's a version that involves scatology
1446280	1449280	and then there's a version that involves incest.
1449280	1451280	He does the incest one.
1451280	1455280	When you say he acts it out, he brings members of his family out.
1455280	1458280	He makes you the victimizer.
1458280	1460280	No, he pantomimes it.
1460280	1462280	It's pantomime.
1464280	1466280	Is this related to the broken ribs?
1466280	1467280	Yeah.
1467280	1471280	This is years, years from like my having seen him.
1471280	1473280	He finds out that I've broken my ribs.
1473280	1476280	He tracks me down to where I'm staying,
1476280	1478280	which is my boyfriend's house at the time.
1478280	1481280	I'm still living in New York.
1481280	1486280	And the opening line of the joke is guy goes to a booking agent.
1486280	1487280	He tracks me down.
1487280	1488280	I've broken my ribs.
1488280	1489280	I, you know, fuck it.
1489280	1492280	I just, you know, breathing hurts.
1492280	1493280	I pick up the phone.
1493280	1494280	No, hi, hello.
1494280	1496280	Guy goes to a booking agent.
1496280	1498280	That's my friend, Chevy.
1498280	1501280	You know, now that's love.
1501280	1503280	That's love.
1503280	1508280	Like he, yeah, like he still calls me and, and vice versa.
1508280	1514280	And it's all like, like he's, he is focused on making people laugh.
1514280	1515280	He's funny.
1515280	1516280	Yeah.
1516280	1523280	And like, like he, I, I, I was at a hot dog stand out.
1523280	1525280	That sounds like I'm making it up.
1525280	1528280	There were, for some reason there was a hot dog stand outside the stage.
1528280	1529280	We were shooting community.
1529280	1530280	Everyone's weary.
1530280	1531280	Everyone's bummed out.
1531280	1532280	No one wants to be there.
1532280	1533280	Everyone wants to get home later.
1533280	1541280	And, and the guy manning the hot dog stand goes, holy shit, it's Chevy Chase.
1541280	1543280	Who's standing in front of me waiting to get a hot dog.
1543280	1545280	And I go, I'm thinking in my head.
1545280	1546280	Oh, great.
1546280	1547280	Oh, fuck.
1547280	1548280	Yeah.
1548280	1550280	I was like, please come on.
1550280	1551280	Don't talk to anybody.
1551280	1553280	We're all, we all just want to go home.
1553280	1554280	And he's like, what do you want?
1554280	1557280	And he goes like, no, fuck my sister's not going to believe this.
1557280	1558280	Oh, shit.
1558280	1559280	Please.
1559280	1560280	Can I, let me call my sister.
1560280	1561280	Will you talk to her on the phone?
1561280	1565280	And I'm just, I'm thinking in my head, like, I don't even have the balls to be a man and
1565280	1570280	say like, sir, excuse me, Chevy Chase wants his hot dog and we need to work.
1570280	1575280	Thank God I didn't have those balls because this guy in front of me who's worked for,
1575280	1580280	you know, a thousand years more than me who has the right to decline or absorb this thing
1580280	1581280	goes like, yeah, give me the phone.
1581280	1582280	Give me the phone.
1582280	1584280	And he takes the phone and it's like, it's right.
1584280	1587280	And he goes like, hello, who's this?
1587280	1588280	Natalie.
1588280	1589280	Natalie, it's Chevy Chase.
1589280	1590280	What the fuck do you want?
1590280	1600280	And the hot dog guy is like freaking out and Chevy Chase walks off down Paramount with
1600280	1606280	the phone and he's gesturing and he's, it's like 15 minutes.
1606280	1609280	I'm like, I'll have a hot dog with lettuce.
1609280	1612280	And I have all that time to think about who I am.
1612280	1616280	I'm like, with lettuce?
1616280	1619280	I don't know anything about being a celebrity.
1619280	1621280	I don't know anything about eating hot dogs.
1621280	1622280	I'm in autopilot mode.
1622280	1626280	I have all that time to think about like, who am I in?
1626280	1627280	Who do I think I am?
1627280	1629280	And how are you supposed to treat people?
1629280	1631280	And what is any of this?
1631280	1635280	Because Chevy Chase is walking off with this cell phone and he brings it back and he hands
1635280	1637280	it to the happiest hot dog guy in the fucking world.
1637280	1640280	And when he hands it back, he said, what are we called?
1640280	1643280	We're called the aristocrats.
1643280	1647280	But that's, yeah, and he would do, like, like if he was walking away from the sound stage,
1647280	1652280	if he ever came across one of those Paramount tour groups or something, you would, you'd
1652280	1657280	pop by and he would be holding court, like they're popping pictures and he's talking
1657280	1661280	because they ran across Fletch on Paramount lot.
1661280	1669280	Anyways, like he, what do you, what do you say?
1669280	1670280	You don't say anything.
1670280	1671280	I have no idea.
1671280	1673280	You say, you say the word Chevy.
1673280	1674280	Yeah.
1674280	1675280	Chevy, I understand.
1675280	1681280	Well, you know, I have no idea what you guys went through, uh, TV, TV comedy, like single
1681280	1691280	camera comedy after the advent of basic cable, after the advent of, I mean, I, we got, uh,
1691280	1700280	and anybody over the age of 55 on that set, like they are, they are already being tortured.
1700280	1705280	I think the Geneva convention, if they knew what was going on for an actor over like,
1705280	1709280	like at a certain point would be like, you're not allowed to do this to human beings.
1709280	1714280	Our crew, you know, like, like we abide by the union rules that we have to abide by,
1714280	1718280	but the truth is there's a new humanity going on on those stages and stuff.
1718280	1720280	So, uh, he was, he was not.
1720280	1723280	So you think exhaustion contributed to a lot of it?
1723280	1728280	I mean, if you're, if you're, if you're that magnetic a personality, how long are you
1728280	1732280	supposed to stand there and be magnetic and be told that you have to do 20 more takes?
1732280	1734280	You know, he was like, not used to that at all.
1734280	1737280	Like, like, because it's like, fuck you, Chevy Chase.
1737280	1738280	What do you mean one more take?
1738280	1739280	Fuck you.
1739280	1740280	You got it.
1740280	1741280	We didn't have it.
1741280	1746280	But, but he felt like we had it.
1746280	1751280	And, uh, yeah, because I, because, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a tough.
1751280	1753280	Well, but my guess is it wasn't fuck you.
1753280	1755280	I'm Chevy Chase.
1755280	1756280	You have it.
1756280	1759280	It was that you're repeatedly asking for it.
1759280	1763280	I, and maybe it made him insecure.
1763280	1764280	Oh, absolutely.
1764280	1765280	God.
1765280	1772280	And it's like the, the, the, the horrible odd mirror that I would look into whenever he
1772280	1776280	and I would like try to talk to each other about what, what, how we were dissatisfied.
1776280	1783280	It was like, how do you, how do you say to somebody like, oh no, I know how you feel.
1783280	1785280	You don't have a right to say that.
1785280	1786280	I'm like you.
1786280	1790280	That is an insult to say that like I'm 20 years younger than you.
1790280	1792280	You're not, I'm not like you.
1792280	1796280	I don't have a right to be like you yet, but like I, you're, oh no, the blood that's
1796280	1799280	boiling in your veins, like I, it's boiling in mine too.
1799280	1803280	But like, like, it'll be funny if you, if you act like it's boiling.
1803280	1807280	Was Chevy, was Chevy like that back in the old days, back in the SNL days, was he like
1807280	1809280	driven by insecurity then?
1809280	1812280	Well, I think that's a, you know, that's your wiring.
1812280	1813280	Yeah.
1813280	1814280	Everybody probably was to some degree, right?
1814280	1815280	Yeah.
1815280	1816280	Anybody on that stage.
1816280	1817280	Right.
1817280	1818280	Yeah.
1818280	1819280	What was, what was Bill Murray like that?
1819280	1824280	So you, you, cause you saw that then he came in and from what I've read, the weird situation
1824280	1830280	that Bill Murray was in was that people mistakenly perceived that he was the replacement for
1830280	1833280	Chevy Chase and he had to go through that whole thing.
1833280	1839280	Well, um, what was he like in the context of thinking it was trying to fill Chevy's
1839280	1840280	shoes.
1840280	1843280	I don't think that he, I mean, I, I, I don't, I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
1844280	1848280	I don't, I mean, I, I can't, I can't speak for Billy.
1848280	1855280	He's a very enigmatic person, but you know, he, uh, he's a great guy.
1855280	1856280	I wish I had my phone with me.
1856280	1859280	I could read some of his texts because they're hilarious.
1859280	1862280	We have a great texting relationship.
1862280	1869280	Uh, one of the, uh, one of our associates, a girl named Robin Schline, who died a couple
1869280	1873280	years ago from cancer, he said, well, I'll come over and fuck you.
1873280	1877280	I think that would be, you know, a nice thing.
1877280	1880280	Uh, you know, so he's, he's just such a great guy.
1880280	1888280	What was the, uh, what was the vibe like before you guys would walk out to start a show?
1888280	1889280	You'd rehearsed it.
1889280	1894280	You'd probably done the, uh, they still did the, um, the, uh, the dress rehearsal.
1894280	1895280	Oh yes.
1895280	1896280	So you did that.
1896280	1900280	So before you guys were ready to go live and do it, what was the camaraderie or the,
1900280	1902280	like, was it, were you guys a team?
1902280	1905280	Was it, was it, was there like a, did you guys get together and have a huddle beforehand?
1905280	1909280	No, you couldn't because you were on all different areas of the stage.
1909280	1910280	Right.
1910280	1915280	Um, which is strange because we went and saw the show, I guess two years ago.
1915280	1916280	I had never seen it before.
1916280	1918280	I'd never been in the audience before.
1918280	1922280	And it was, uh, I think Ed Helms was the host and they've really blocked off a lot
1922280	1925280	of sections of the, of the floor.
1925280	1928280	You know, which we used to use the whole floor as sets.
1928280	1929280	Meaning what?
1929280	1931280	Cause I can't even picture to begin with what the floor would look like.
1931280	1933280	What do you mean by sectioned off?
1933280	1936280	Um, they've closed it off, you know, um,
1936280	1940280	There's sets where you can't, you can't see everything from certain parts of the audience.
1940280	1941280	Right.
1941280	1942280	Well, they've used them.
1942280	1947280	I think they're using parts of where like the bleachers are for the upstairs.
1947280	1954280	We use, you know, some of that area was opened up and we used it, the floor area as sets.
1954280	1956280	And now they're, they're just enclosed.
1956280	1962280	I think they use them for, uh, costume changes and wig changes and things like that.
1962280	1965280	So they use very little of the floor now.
1965280	1970280	And I think, you know, also they have just new technology that helps them along.
1970280	1971280	Did you get that feeling?
1971280	1974280	Like, cause I've gone back to theaters that I performed at when I was a kid
1974280	1978280	and you walk in there and you have that kind of where the ocean I'm on kind of like,
1978280	1982280	like for me anyway, I get like a weird energy of like, like, like you, you,
1982280	1985280	you remember some of that, the, the, the old frights.
1985280	1991280	What was it like going back and seeing a show there and not being like having to go out and do it?
1991280	1995280	Oh, you mean, did I have like a auxiliary stage fright?
1995280	2000280	What was like, what was it like to return there after years and see it, see it different?
2000280	2002280	Like, what was the emotional?
2002280	2007280	Well, it, um, they cleaned it up nice.
2007280	2009280	The upstairs was always so ratty, you know,
2009280	2011280	speaking of what it was like in the beginning because, you know,
2011280	2016280	we had all their shit furniture, you know, like from the, you know,
2016280	2019280	whatever floor that was the oral histories that I read.
2019280	2022280	Let's give them that couch from the Bob's.
2022280	2023280	You guys were punk rock.
2023280	2024280	You were doing a variety show.
2024280	2031280	The whole point was it was a variety show by people that were not supposed to be in charge of.
2031280	2033280	Yeah, that was what was so exciting about it.
2033280	2038280	We really felt like we were able to put on stuff that made us laugh.
2038280	2041280	And we just couldn't believe the kind of stuff that we were able to put on.
2041280	2045280	The interesting thing is that constant question of when is comedy,
2045280	2048280	because when you're laughing at things, there's nothing more subversive than that.
2048280	2052280	And then at the same time, like everybody loves to laugh and that's why it's subversive.
2052280	2055280	So then like comedy becomes institutionalized.
2055280	2059280	I don't know what the fuck my point is and where I'm going with this rant,
2059280	2065280	but it's like this was a punk rock variety show with a bunch of pot smoking,
2065280	2069280	happy-go-lucky people just fucking around.
2069280	2071280	And it was live.
2071280	2073280	And it wasn't supposed to.
2073280	2075280	The idea that you had cones on your head was ironic.
2075280	2077280	It wasn't like, hey, let's get the cone.
2077280	2079280	I don't know how to articulate it.
2079280	2084280	Well, I think that the reason it's still as successful is because it's allowed to be idiosyncratic.
2084280	2090280	You know, character-driven stuff always works if it's a really original character.
2090280	2094280	And I think that they pick good talent and they have good writers.
2094280	2102280	It's not always at the same time, but they've always had great people, always.
2102280	2105280	And they've had tough seasons and they've had great seasons.
2105280	2107280	Have you watched it consistently all the way through?
2107280	2108280	No.
2108280	2110280	When my kids were small, I didn't.
2110280	2111280	And there was no such thing as TiVo.
2111280	2113280	But now that there is, I watch it all the time.
2113280	2114280	I love it.
2114280	2115280	Yeah.
2115280	2116280	Because I still love sketch comedy.
2116280	2120280	I mean, if today's SNL was held to the...
2120280	2125280	I'm sorry, if 1975 SNL was held to the standard that we do now where we go,
2125280	2127280	okay, what were the two funny sketches?
2127280	2132280	Let's put them on a split-sider and put a little clicky link in the thing.
2132280	2134280	It was a variety show.
2134280	2137280	And the description of that process is amazing.
2137280	2139280	Who was the coolest musical guest that you got to meet?
2139280	2143280	I mean, for me, I don't get stress-struck around actors or famous people, musicians.
2143280	2144280	Me too.
2144280	2145280	Yeah.
2145280	2148280	Comedians, we all love rockers and musicians.
2148280	2149280	I'm the same way.
2149280	2151280	Who was the grooviest that you got to meet?
2151280	2152280	David Bowie.
2152280	2153280	Oh, shit!
2153280	2156280	See, like, I'm straight, but I would make out with Bowie.
2156280	2158280	I would absolutely make out.
2158280	2160280	Like, right now, I'd make out with David Bowie.
2160280	2161280	Yeah, George Harrison too.
2161280	2163280	Oh, yeah.
2163280	2164280	I'd make out with his music lately.
2164280	2165280	Who wasn't done there?
2165280	2166280	It's almost more notable.
2166280	2171280	Like, who in those five years, who wouldn't have been on there?
2171280	2173280	So what was Bowie singing then?
2173280	2174280	Do you remember the songs he sang?
2174280	2176280	What records was he doing then?
2176280	2177280	I don't.
2177280	2184280	I just remember that Klaus Nomi and Joey Arias, who had been a-groundling, and Tony Sails,
2184280	2189280	who was my best friend in middle school, were in his band.
2191280	2194280	Just because he picked up local guys?
2194280	2197280	You're just the Forrest Gump of David Bowie's...
2199280	2201280	At that point, did you go, wait, is that what I am?
2201280	2203280	I'm in a cog in David Bowie's...
2203280	2204280	That's right.
2204280	2205280	I'm just...
2205280	2206280	I'm zelling.
2207280	2213280	Yeah, I just know, but I just wish they would have Skrillex on, that's all.
2214280	2217280	Hashtag Skrillex on SNL.
2217280	2219280	You were definitely there during some of the...
2219280	2223280	Look, for me, the coolest era of music, like the talent back then.
2223280	2226280	Yeah, Devo was on, and Elvis Costello.
2226280	2229280	I mean, for sure, back then, that was the...
2230280	2233280	You can't talk shit about SNL now, and it's like, that's the thing.
2233280	2235280	You can't talk shit about it.
2235280	2236280	That's not cool.
2236280	2241280	It's a fucking institution, and now half my friends are on it, or have been on it,
2241280	2244280	and it's like, it's an institution.
2246280	2251280	Your mind is torn in half by your relationship with SNL.
2252280	2258280	The Lonely Island guys who started his Channel 101 guys and went to SNL,
2259280	2260280	they...
2260280	2262280	I think it was one of them that kind of summed it up.
2262280	2265280	I'm sure this has been pointed out by anyone else, but they had said,
2265280	2269280	you know, everyone has grown up on SNL.
2269280	2274280	Everyone thinks that the SNL from when they were 10 years old was the perfect SNL,
2274280	2277280	and everyone thinks that the SNL from when they're 20 is a piece of shit.
2278280	2280280	Everyone has that luxury now.
2280280	2282280	It's been there the entire time, and you go,
2282280	2285280	and I went, yeah, oh yeah, Martin Short, Christopher Guest,
2285280	2287280	holy shit, those were the days.
2287280	2288280	They were great.
2288280	2291280	They were, but it's like, they weren't any better than anything.
2291280	2297280	I mean, it's crazy to appraise seasons of SNL.
2297280	2300280	But it's also crazy to just say one season was better than the other,
2300280	2302280	because they were all different.
2302280	2305280	Season four of Community, however.
2306280	2317280	Was a lot like watching the season 20 of SNL be forced to watch
2317280	2323280	season one of Chevy Chase's talk show on a beach.
2327280	2331280	I don't want to put you on the spot, but if I had my preference,
2331280	2334280	you would stay up here for our next guest to come up,
2334280	2337280	just because I think it would be interesting to have you up here,
2337280	2340280	but you could totally leave too and pretend that you have a medical emergency
2340280	2342280	or a family in pain.
2342280	2344280	Yes, but there's no dialogue between me and your guest.
2344280	2345280	No, there is.
2345280	2347280	You stay there, you stay exactly where you are.
2347280	2349280	That's why I think it might be...
2349280	2351280	Why don't I move over here and all?
2351280	2353280	I'm really interested in what he has to say,
2353280	2355280	which I could hear out there too.
2355280	2358280	I say stay exactly where you are and just, okay, good.
2358280	2360280	I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to leave.
2360280	2362280	No, I don't want to leave.
2362280	2365280	I mean, we are going somewhere after this, but I don't want to leave now.
2365280	2366280	All right.
2366280	2367280	Are we supposed to leave, Chad?
2367280	2368280	No.
2368280	2370280	All right.
2370280	2372280	Remember that guy?
2375280	2378280	It's the Lorraine Newman no-guy.
2381280	2383280	Would you save a seat for me?
2383280	2385280	Yeah.
2385280	2388280	Sometimes he likes stuff.
2388280	2391280	The Lorraine Newman no-guy.
2392280	2394280	Well, the Feral Audio...
2394280	2397280	Boy, we got a lot of podcasts on that network.
2397280	2399280	This guy's got one of them.
2399280	2405280	His name is Dr. Ph.D. Dr. Chris Ryan.
2406280	2408280	And he has a...
2413280	2416280	He has a podcast called Tangentially Speaking.
2416280	2418280	Oh, God.
2422280	2423280	No, yeah, yeah, please.
2423280	2425280	Sit.
2427280	2428280	There was that hang time.
2428280	2430280	I'm glad Lorraine stayed.
2430280	2431280	It's great.
2431280	2432280	I thought she might...
2432280	2434280	Now I can say I've been on a stage with Lorraine Newman.
2434280	2435280	Yeah, yeah.
2435280	2437280	It feels important.
2437280	2443280	Yeah, I didn't want to blow her off, but also because you are...
2443280	2447280	The interesting thing about your...
2447280	2450280	The book that you wrote...
2450280	2455280	It involves monogamy versus polygamy in our species as primates.
2455280	2459280	You were a guy whose Ph.D. is in psychology, but you became kind of...
2459280	2464280	You stumbled into anthropology, wrote a book where you...
2464280	2468280	Didn't have any horse in the race, but you kind of ended up making the case.
2468280	2470280	This is a very sensitive issue for people.
2470280	2471280	Yeah.
2471280	2472280	Myself included.
2472280	2475280	Everybody gets their buttons pushed by this idea of,
2475280	2480280	is humankind naturally monogamous?
2480280	2481280	Yeah, yeah.
2481280	2482280	It's a funny thing.
2482280	2487280	People want to believe that we are when all the evidence suggests we're not.
2487280	2490280	So that makes it a conflictive kind of conversation.
2490280	2496280	But also in anthropology, then don't you count the fact that we all want to believe we are as evidence to the fact that we are?
2496280	2497280	No.
2499280	2500280	Behaviorally...
2500280	2503280	That's the difference between science and bullshit right there.
2504280	2505280	You summed it up.
2505280	2506280	No.
2506280	2507280	I mean, if you look...
2507280	2514280	I was just doing a thing the other night with Amushikasher and some comedians talking about science.
2514280	2515280	And yeah.
2515280	2521280	I mean, the simplest way to explain human behavior is to say we're not a polygamous species, right?
2521280	2524280	Polygamy would be one male and several females.
2524280	2531280	They were a promiscuous species where both the males and the females had multiple sexual partners.
2532280	2541280	So the simplest way to explain contemporary human behavior is simply to say we're a promiscuous species that's being told to be monogamous.
2541280	2542280	Right.
2542280	2544280	And we can roll with that because of how promiscuous we are.
2544280	2547280	It's like a Swiss army knife being told you have to open wine bottles.
2547280	2548280	Right.
2549280	2552280	But the blade comes out a gauge of mine, right?
2553280	2555280	Yeah, we're still Swiss.
2555280	2556280	Yeah, we're still Swiss.
2556280	2557280	Yeah.
2557280	2559280	And it's based a lot.
2559280	2563280	Humans are related to chimps, most closely of all.
2563280	2566280	And of those chimps, it's the...
2566280	2567280	How do you pronounce it?
2567280	2568280	Bonobo?
2568280	2569280	Bonobo.
2569280	2570280	They are like...
2570280	2571280	Okay.
2571280	2573280	Here's where I lay my cards on the table.
2573280	2576280	This is why I refer to you as the Dan Harmon of informed people.
2576280	2581280	Because I read one book about this and pretend to be an expert on all this.
2581280	2585280	And you wrote a book on it and probably read a million books on it and don't pretend to be an expert on it.
2585280	2589280	But I read Desmond Morris's book from the 60s, The Naked Ape.
2589280	2593280	And I think he was the one that talked about the bonobo chimps.
2593280	2604280	And he talked about specifically how back in the day when science was still actually accountable to some degree to social propriety,
2604280	2610280	when you're just studying chimps-fucking, they had found this breed of chimps.
2610280	2613280	Is that accurate to call bonobos a breed of chimps?
2613280	2620280	Well, they used to be called pygmy chimps, despite the fact that they're not really smaller than common chimps.
2620280	2622280	They're a separate species.
2622280	2627280	In fact, Jared Diamond, who wrote Guns, Germs, and Steel, and a bunch of other things,
2627280	2634280	argues quite convincingly that chimps, humans, and bonobos are really three subspecies of chimpanzee.
2634280	2636280	We're so closely related.
2636280	2640280	If you go to the zoo and you see the chimps or the bonobos in the zoo,
2640280	2648280	you are more closely related to them than they are to anything else in the zoo, gorillas or orangutans or what have you.
2648280	2655280	So the chimps, humans, and bonobos are more closely related, for example, than the Indian elephant is to the African elephant.
2655280	2656280	Oh, well, okay.
2656280	2659280	In terms of just genetic, like...
2659280	2661280	Last common ancestor and shared DNA.
2661280	2662280	Wow.
2662280	2663280	Yeah.
2663280	2665280	We're extremely closely related to that.
2666280	2671280	What percentage is our DNA, like, linked to a chimpanzee?
2671280	2675280	Well, there are many different ways that scientists use to measure that.
2675280	2682280	So numbers vary, but from 98 to 95 and a half percent is the general range.
2682280	2683280	But also...
2683280	2686280	But I mean, that's kind of a nonsense thing.
2686280	2688280	Because we have 70 percent in common with watermelon.
2688280	2689280	That half a percent?
2689280	2690280	Yeah, exactly.
2690280	2694280	A watermelon is 98 percent water, like a genetic one.
2694280	2695280	Exactly.
2696280	2699280	All I know is we don't have to go to work tomorrow.
2699280	2701280	That's what I'm getting from all those.
2703280	2710280	Also, interestingly, speaking of not going to work, both chimps and bonobos sleep in hammocks, which I find really fascinating.
2710280	2711280	I love hammocks.
2711280	2713280	In nature or just when they're provided, though?
2713280	2715280	No, they weave hammocks every night.
2715280	2717280	They weave branches together and sleep...
2717280	2718280	They create hammocks.
2718280	2727280	So we argue, Casilda, my wife and I, who's back there somewhere, argue insects at dawn that hammocks are the first human technology because it creates humanity.
2727280	2728280	I fucking love hammocks.
2728280	2729280	I thought that that was a...
2729280	2733280	But when you get into a hammock, it feels so good.
2735280	2737280	I thought it was because I had Asperger's or something.
2738280	2740280	It's because I'm a monkey.
2740280	2742280	It's primal, man.
2742280	2749280	Desmond Morris's book, and a lot of what Desmond Morris discussed has been subsequently questioned and challenged and stuff.
2749280	2758280	But what he talks about is they discovered this type of chimp is really more closely related to us.
2758280	2760280	Or as you're saying, they're like cousins of...
2760280	2762280	Well, they're equidistant from us, too.
2762280	2764280	We both descended from chimps.
2764280	2769280	And the interesting thing about them was always how much fucking and sucking they did.
2770280	2772280	They are incestuous.
2772280	2774280	They are bisexual.
2775280	2780280	He referred to them settling gang disputes through orgies.
2781280	2784280	They're known as the aristocrats of the jungle.
2786280	2788280	They do it all.
2788280	2790280	Guy goes into a talent office.
2790280	2793280	They make the Kamasutra look like an episode of My Three Sons.
2793280	2795280	Guy goes into a hammock.
2796280	2801280	And in the 50s, when they're discovering this stuff, they're sort of discovering it and going,
2801280	2803280	eh, weird monkey.
2803280	2806280	And then over time, we're going, wait, that's us.
2806280	2807280	That's what's going on.
2807280	2809280	That's what's raging inside our brain.
2809280	2813280	Yeah, they're also the only other mammal that has sex face to face.
2814280	2816280	They stare into each other's eyes.
2816280	2817280	They kiss.
2817280	2819280	They have oral sex.
2819280	2821280	They exchange food while they're having sex.
2821280	2822280	Gross.
2822280	2823280	That's gross.
2826280	2827280	I don't like food and sex.
2827280	2830280	Whenever there's chocolate syrup or something, I don't like it.
2831280	2832280	Whipped cream.
2832280	2834280	Yeah, that could leave the food out of it.
2834280	2835280	Yeah.
2835280	2842280	Franz de Waal, who's a very famous Dutch primatologist, said that chimpanzees use violence to get sex
2842280	2845280	and bonobos use sex to avoid violence.
2845280	2853280	In about 50 years of observation, both in the jungle and in captivity, no bonobo has ever been witnessed
2853280	2855280	to kill or rape another bonobo.
2856280	2857280	Not once.
2857280	2861280	And believe me, if you're the first one to see it, your career is made, right?
2862280	2864280	That's the holy grail of climatology.
2865280	2870280	You just created a whole new, weird payola scandal.
2870280	2871280	That's going to happen.
2872280	2874280	Bonobo rape porn.
2875280	2877280	It's going to be 30 years from now.
2877280	2880280	Bonobo rape staged by Dr. Santa?
2881280	2883280	Paid for at Bitcoin.
2886280	2888280	So we do with that information.
2889280	2894280	Okay, so let me walk through the emotional experience that a human being with a necktie
2894280	2902280	that's got to go to work tomorrow at 9 a.m. that loves his wife and loves his kids.
2903280	2908280	The emotional thought experience that he has when he reads a scientist saying that human
2908280	2911280	beings aren't naturally monogamous.
2912280	2918280	The natural experience is that that person says, well, that is implying that my life is a lie.
2919280	2920280	That's implying that...
2920280	2921280	Yeah, but that's a mistake.
2921280	2923280	That's a very shallow interpretation.
2923280	2928280	That's like if you're talking to a vegetarian and you say our ancestors were omnivores,
2928280	2931280	is the vegetarian going to say therefore my life is a lie?
2931280	2932280	I don't think so.
2932280	2935280	I think most vegetarians would say, yeah, of course they were.
2935280	2939280	That's why being a vegetarian is hard, but I still choose to do it.
2939280	2940280	Right.
2940280	2944280	We're also clearly descended from a lot of murderers.
2945280	2950280	We bashed each other's brains in and slurped our brains from each other's skulls.
2950280	2951280	Well, it's not so fast.
2951280	2952280	We don't have to keep doing that.
2952280	2953280	That's so fast.
2955280	2959280	I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying, but people often say to me,
2959280	2964280	because I'm in the business of talking about human nature, which everybody's got an opinion on,
2964280	2966280	people say like, okay, what is human nature?
2966280	2970280	Are we naturally violent, as you're suggesting, like Steven Pinker suggests and others?
2970280	2971280	Or are we natural?
2971280	2972280	Fuck Pinker.
2972280	2973280	Fuck Steven Pinker.
2973280	2975280	I know, I've said that many times.
2978280	2980280	What the hell was they saying?
2980280	2982280	Steven Pinker always sidetracks me.
2983280	2991280	But the thing is, there's all sorts of interesting research showing that toddlers of six months old
2991280	2993280	already have a sense of justice.
2994280	3000280	And one thing I often say is, look, nobody's walking around suffering from PTSD because they helped a stranger.
3001280	3007280	So no matter how violent you think we are by nature, it's interesting that we have to be trained to hurt each other.
3007280	3011280	And even after boot camp, it still fucks us up.
3011280	3020280	So I think that the evidence is quite clear that we are, by nature, a species very interested in justice and egalitarianism.
3020280	3021280	And compassion.
3021280	3022280	And compassion.
3022280	3028280	And by nature, we can, under extreme circumstances, be extremely cruel and nasty and bizarre.
3028280	3031280	But that's not our nature as a species.
3031280	3034280	What do we share that with?
3034280	3040280	Who's the common ancestor that wants to rip throats out if we are actually, well, it's the chimpanzee, according to,
3040280	3046280	if we're equidistant with bonobos from the chimp, then bonobos are like fucking and sucking and swinging.
3046280	3049280	They're the 70s of chimpanzees.
3049280	3054280	And we're over here being like, you know, we're Devo going like, OK, we can do this.
3054280	3059280	Let's just build a couple more skyscrapers and beep, boop, boop, boop.
3059280	3066280	But we all have that grandfather, that great Santini above us going like, get in there, get your ass in the dirt, private!
3066280	3070280	Rip that throat out, tell that woman what's her job.
3070280	3073280	Dan, when is your book Mixed Metaphors coming up?
3080280	3084280	It's an album, Jeff.
3084280	3087280	And it's going to be the book of movies.
3092280	3097280	So what do you think is the final word on us?
3097280	3100280	What's the final word on us?
3100280	3101280	I believe so, too.
3101280	3103280	Children in a sandpit aren't racist.
3103280	3105280	We learn that.
3105280	3110280	And also, I don't think we're naturally, I think we're naturally, there's a bit of competition and competitiveness in us.
3110280	3115280	But I don't think that, like you said, we have an innate sense of justice.
3115280	3125280	I think there's other things that come along later on, like capitalism and governments, that we reward war and we reward conflict.
3125280	3126280	Property.
3126280	3127280	Yeah.
3127280	3129280	Well, see, that's the essential difference.
3129280	3139280	I mean, that's really what our book is about, is to understand that our species has existed for at least 200,000 years as an anatomically modern species, right?
3139280	3142280	Agriculture only came about 10,000 years ago.
3142280	3151280	So that's 5% of our time on Earth as a species, or much less if you include pre-modern species of human, right?
3151280	3154280	So it's a very small percentage in any case.
3154280	3162280	And before agriculture, the way societies were designed was completely different from the way it is after agriculture.
3162280	3164280	Think about property.
3164280	3169280	All hunter-gatherer people are what anthropologists call fiercely egalitarian.
3169280	3170280	They share everything.
3170280	3172280	And if you don't share, fuck you.
3172280	3173280	Get the hell out of here.
3173280	3183280	Which is why anthropologists have a big problem when they show up with a big box full of chocolate bars and peanut butter to last a whole year while they're doing their research and they won't share it with anybody.
3183280	3184280	The people are like, what the fuck?
3184280	3186280	What kind of person are you?
3186280	3187280	You come here.
3187280	3188280	You eat our food.
3188280	3189280	You ask me about my grandfather.
3189280	3190280	You want to study everything.
3190280	3192280	And you won't share your peanut butter with us, right?
3192280	3195280	It's a completely different mindset.
3195280	3200280	But then when they give them the peanut butter, then they're like, okay, so how is the world created?
3200280	3202280	From peanut butter!
3202280	3203280	I love it!
3203280	3204280	It's true.
3204280	3205280	Cargo cults.
3205280	3206280	That's another big problem.
3206280	3207280	Cargo cults.
3207280	3208280	Yeah.
3208280	3211280	There are people who believe that the gods give canned goods, you know that?
3211280	3212280	But that's another story.
3212280	3215280	So how did it change when agriculture came along?
3215280	3218280	Well, agriculture introduced the concept of private property.
3218280	3220280	And now people lived in settlements.
3220280	3223280	They could accumulate property.
3223280	3228280	So for the first time, men really had a reason to care about their paternity.
3228280	3231280	Because, like, I don't want to leave, you know, this building.
3231280	3232280	They weren't nomadic anymore.
3232280	3233280	They weren't.
3233280	3234280	Yeah, exactly.
3234280	3235280	They weren't nomadic.
3235280	3236280	It's so interesting.
3236280	3239280	So that's when they took control of women, right?
3239280	3242280	And that's when women became property.
3242280	3245280	If you read the Old Testament, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.
3245280	3248280	We all think that's, like, respect his marriage, right?
3248280	3249280	No.
3249280	3250280	Read it in context.
3250280	3251280	It continues.
3251280	3257280	Nor his house, nor his slave, nor his she-ass, really, she-ass, nor his ox.
3257280	3259280	Don't covet thy neighbor's property.
3259280	3262280	And the wife is just part of the property.
3262280	3264280	So it's a huge change.
3264280	3269280	So when people are hunting, when people are out there with spears, like, OK, they're like
3269280	3275280	a football team running around, let's go kill some mammoth and we'll bring the mammoth meat
3275280	3281280	back to wherever we're camped for the night, you're saying that's fiercely egalitarian
3281280	3285280	because maybe the women are staying behind.
3285280	3290280	I don't know if that's politically incorrect to imply, but I can't go back in time and see
3290280	3291280	it.
3291280	3295280	I'm just saying that, like, the agricultural societies where there's, like, yeah, we live
3295280	3298280	in one place, we have a city, we're going to irrigate these crops.
3298280	3300280	And you can store grain.
3300280	3306280	There's leisure time because you can actually, you can start to store crops and you can have
3306280	3308280	a granary where you can live.
3308280	3312280	But that's also where math comes from, it's where astronomy comes from, it's where...
3312280	3313280	Leisure time.
3313280	3317280	But why, and I'm sorry, what's your first name again?
3317280	3318280	Chris.
3318280	3319280	Chris.
3319280	3321280	Why do women become property then?
3321280	3325280	Because when men have property then they're very concerned with their paternity so that
3325280	3327280	they're leaving their property to their sons.
3327280	3330280	But why is it men that have the property when agriculture comes along?
3330280	3337280	Because the main advantage in agricultural societies is upper body strength because of
3337280	3340280	the plow, that you had to be able to control a plow.
3340280	3345280	Also warfare became very important because agricultural societies tend to expand...
3345280	3347280	So they're protecting borders.
3347280	3348280	Right.
3348280	3353280	Women in hunter-gatherer societies have equal or sometimes higher status than men.
3353280	3357280	But women rule in a completely different way through consensus.
3357280	3361280	Men in matriarchal societies get laid a lot.
3361280	3363280	It's much better.
3363280	3367280	For example, bonobos are female dominated.
3367280	3372280	Even though the female bonobo is a little smaller than the male, as with chimps and humans,
3372280	3377280	if a male attacks a female, all the females will gang up on that male and attack him.
3377280	3382280	So when you're running a plow and to be agricultural, you need that upper body strength.
3382280	3386280	Men are running their farms.
3386280	3388280	They become the rulers.
3388280	3390280	Then there's more time to build structures.
3390280	3392280	And specialization.
3392280	3395280	Yeah, permanent structures that last for a long time.
3395280	3401280	So then that's when you say patriarchy comes along with let's make sure the hereditary,
3401280	3402280	the bloodline stays.
3402280	3404280	Then you have rulers.
3404280	3407280	And that's when men become assholes?
3407280	3408280	Yeah.
3408280	3410280	That's when the inner asshole comes out.
3410280	3412280	I have to update my...
3412280	3417280	My Joseph Campbell-informed understanding of how this all worked was that
3417280	3422280	it was these male-dominated football squads.
3422280	3427280	I pictured these cavemen and these fur loincloth going like,
3427280	3431280	you take the left, you take the right, Johnson, go 20, go deep!
3431280	3436280	And they spear these animals and they take the meat back home to these little encampments.
3436280	3438280	And then those encampments travel.
3438280	3443280	And then those assholes go down to the equator where these
3443280	3446280	incredibly advanced societies have been formed.
3446280	3449280	Sometimes incredibly brutal, but advanced societies have been formed
3449280	3454280	because they're able to, because they live in a more equatorial climate.
3454280	3460280	They have created a society around the stars and the rising tide and all that stuff.
3460280	3466280	And then these patriarchal guys come in and go, fuck you.
3466280	3473280	You may be organized, but you don't know home invasion like we do.
3473280	3477280	And they just take over and they're idiots, but they own the alphabet.
3477280	3481280	And they're just like, okay, ABCD, I guess.
3481280	3484280	That was my understanding of it.
3484280	3486280	Is that what Joseph Campbell said?
3486280	3489280	That was the picture I got from him, yeah.
3489280	3493280	Yeah, well, I mean, you're right that the men generally, and it's not politically incorrect,
3493280	3498280	it's accurate according to the data I've read, that the men generally went hunting
3498280	3501280	and the women generally gathered.
3501280	3505280	Now, what's interesting is that about 60 to 70% of the calories that people lived on
3505280	3509280	came from the gathering, not from the hunting, right?
3509280	3513280	And there are all sorts of things we recount in our book, like in the Amazon,
3513280	3518280	there's a tribe, the Culina, that have a ritual where when the men,
3518280	3522280	okay, so men don't like to hunt generally, right?
3522280	3523280	They'll go occasionally.
3523280	3524280	But men are lazy.
3524280	3525280	They're in their hammocks, right?
3525280	3529280	So the women have a ritual called the Tutsi at Buane,
3529280	3533280	where they, in the morning, the women will get up and they'll go around the village
3533280	3537280	and they sing the song that basically translates to, we want meat,
3537280	3539280	you men don't give us enough meat.
3539280	3543280	And I wrote to the anthropologist and I said, is there a double entendre there?
3543280	3545280	And he was like, yeah, definitely.
3545280	3547280	Buane is casting a right glance, right?
3547280	3548280	Yeah.
3548280	3551280	So they go around the village and the women will like,
3551280	3553280	they'll go up to the man who's lying in his hammock
3553280	3558280	and a woman will go and bang on the post where his hammock is tied.
3558280	3562280	And this is not his, the woman he normally has sex with, right?
3562280	3566280	And what it means is if you come home with some meat tonight, I'll fuck you.
3566280	3569280	So it's motivation for these guys like, oh, I get some strange.
3569280	3570280	If I kill a monkey.
3570280	3573280	I get some strange.
3574280	3580280	So we should rename our species to hominis pivinus.
3580280	3583280	I'm sorry, that's a Jeremy Piven joke.
3583280	3585280	Strange seeking missile.
3585280	3588280	So they, okay.
3588280	3591280	So then the guys, like, if you don't, if you're not into that woman,
3591280	3592280	you can say, oh, my stomach's bad.
3592280	3594280	And like, okay, they'll let it ride, right?
3594280	3597280	But so then the guys will get together.
3597280	3601280	And now in the Amazon, they hunt independently because the game is very sparse
3601280	3604280	in the, you know, it's monkeys, basically, and they're spread out.
3604280	3606280	So the guys will all leave the village together.
3606280	3611280	But before they split up, they agree to meet at a certain place at a certain time.
3611280	3612280	So then they go out.
3612280	3614280	A couple of the guys will shoot a monkey.
3614280	3615280	The others won't.
3615280	3616280	They'll come back.
3616280	3617280	They got a couple of monkeys.
3617280	3618280	They cut up the monkeys.
3618280	3621280	So every guy walks back into the village with meat.
3621280	3623280	And they all get laid.
3623280	3624280	Wow.
3624280	3627280	And the anthropologist who wrote this in an academic paper at the end,
3627280	3633280	he wrote, the Colina participate in this ritual in very good cheer.
3633280	3634280	Of course they do.
3634280	3640280	So now as a guy who is delving into all of this, as a married guy who's in love
3640280	3648280	with his wife and who has his own ego and his own, like, what meat do you get today?
3648280	3653280	When you come up against this point where you go like, oh, this is how humans,
3654280	3657280	how do you, like, we talked about this earlier.
3657280	3669280	So our human species, like, we, monogamy is, it may not be an instinct for us,
3669280	3677280	but it's something that we want to do and that is worthwhile in that way.
3677280	3681280	I'm asking you as the guy who wrote the book and who is married,
3681280	3684280	how you're coping with that information as it's coming in.
3684280	3686280	Why doesn't it change you?
3686280	3691280	Why don't you run out naked in the street and become the guy who's preaching
3691280	3694280	the gospel of polygamy?
3694280	3697280	Would you like us to talk about Chevy again?
3697280	3699280	Has he run out naked in the street?
3699280	3704280	If you're saying that we're not scientifically hardwired to monogamy,
3704280	3707280	why is that something that's persistent?
3707280	3709280	Is there a benefit socially for us?
3709280	3713280	Well, it's an economic institution that's persisted because of private property,
3713280	3717280	because it makes more sense and fits into an economic world
3717280	3719280	that we've lived in for quite a while.
3719280	3721280	Okay, then I have another question.
3721280	3726280	Since, like, you know, if that really is the roots of misogyny
3726280	3733280	and male domination and grossness, why, since we aren't really, you know,
3733280	3737280	a hunter-gatherer society and really we're not an agricultural society,
3737280	3740280	I mean, we certainly need agriculture to survive,
3740280	3744280	but we're not really, we don't need upper-body strength to survive anymore.
3744280	3746280	Why does that male domination persist now?
3746280	3748280	Is that just a hangover from that long ago?
3748280	3752280	Or do we know why women still get less money
3752280	3754280	and why we still treat women like shit all the time?
3754280	3757280	And like, what's, why does that persist?
3757280	3763280	Well, I think women are still subjugated in the sense that they're still seen
3763280	3767280	largely as breeding vessels in much of the world
3767280	3770280	and in this part of the world until very recently.
3770280	3775280	You know, adultery, as defined in the Bible and as defined in Western society
3775280	3780280	until 20 years ago, only referred to the women.
3780280	3785280	You weren't an adulterer if you screwed a single woman even though you were married.
3785280	3788280	Right, and then you have the bastard son running around,
3788280	3790280	you know, the Game of Thrones thing where it's like,
3790280	3793280	it's okay to have your seat perched somewhere on accident.
3793280	3798280	In fact, it's advantageous, you know, it was a sign of wealth and power.
3798280	3802280	So, I mean, yeah, there are a lot of lingering effects of this in Western society
3802280	3805280	and certainly if you look at, you know, Iran or Afghanistan
3805280	3810280	where women are still being stoned to death for the crime of having been raped.
3810280	3812280	Right, it's insane.
3812280	3815280	So women are still seen as property very much.
3815280	3818280	And what we really rebelled against in our book
3818280	3822280	is this idea that women are by nature gold diggers, right?
3822280	3827280	Women are by their very nature trading sexual access for, you know,
3827280	3832280	goods and services for men, for status or meat and the ancestral environment
3832280	3834280	or whatever it is.
3834280	3836280	That's bullshit.
3836280	3840280	Women were put in a position where all they had left to barter with was their sexuality.
3840280	3842280	So of course they did in order to survive
3842280	3846280	because if you had a kid as a single woman in Victorian England in Darwin's day,
3846280	3847280	you were a piece of shit.
3847280	3850280	You were thrown into the street and your kids would starve to death, right?
3850280	3854280	Yeah, if you're not allowed to be a senator ever and you don't have a penis,
3854280	3856280	yeah, and you're ambitious.
3856280	3857280	So what do you do?
3857280	3860280	You survive, I mean, you try to survive.
3860280	3862280	So, but what was your question?
3862280	3863280	Oh, what do you do?
3863280	3865280	Well, my question was, what do you say to yourself at night
3865280	3869280	as you go to bed next to your lovely wife as you turn out the light
3869280	3872280	and you go, I got my dog, I go, do you have kids?
3872280	3875280	You know, you're living the American dream, you get your white picket fence,
3875280	3879280	you wrote a book that says that people want to fuck everybody.
3879280	3881280	They do, but we just look at them, right?
3881280	3883280	So what's the follow-up to that?
3883280	3886280	What's the epilogue to that, to a happily married man?
3886280	3889280	Well, the epilogue is that we all make our own decisions
3889280	3891280	and that, you know, as I said earlier about vegetarianism.
3891280	3895280	We also want to take a shit, but we do it in a toilet.
3895280	3897280	We also want to pick our nose, but we don't eat it.
3897280	3900280	Why are you equating sex with horrible things?
3900280	3902280	Hear him out, hear him out, doctor.
3902280	3907280	Well, I jumped, go ahead, finish.
3907280	3909280	I assumed that's what you were going to say.
3909280	3915280	No, I think, you know, people find their own compromises.
3915280	3916280	People find ways.
3916280	3919280	The only thing, we don't advocate anything in the book.
3919280	3921280	The only thing, you know, in terms of behavior,
3921280	3924280	we only advocate compassion and understanding.
3924280	3928280	And, you know, let's start from a realistic understanding
3928280	3929280	of what sort of species we are.
3929280	3933280	So we look at anthropology, we look at primatology,
3933280	3936280	we look at human anatomy, particularly reproductive anatomy,
3936280	3940280	the shape of the penis, the volume of the testicles,
3940280	3942280	the fact that women can have multiple orgasms.
3942280	3947280	I got in trouble giving a TED Talk because Meg Ryan was in the audience
3947280	3950280	and I decided to go off script and talked about female
3950280	3954280	copulatory vocalization, right?
3954280	3956280	And that really pissed them off so that...
3956280	3958280	She can't have a problem with that.
3958280	3960280	She doesn't, but the guy who runs TED did.
3960280	3961280	Oh.
3961280	3969280	He was like, I won't have what you're saying she's having.
3969280	3974280	Thank you, guys. Thank you.
3974280	3977280	Well, there's also something to be said about anatomy
3977280	3979280	in the context of children.
3979280	3983280	I mean, you know, there's a lot of evidence of the destructive impact
3983280	3987280	of, you know, a parent leaving, you know...
3987280	3990280	Desmond Morris' book, which is, again,
3990280	3993280	it's totally the only anthropology book I've ever read
3993280	3996280	by this guy in the 60s who literally, that guy,
3996280	3998280	I don't think in this book he said it,
3998280	4000280	but he did say, just to put this in context,
4000280	4006280	he did imply that women's breasts evolved to look the way they did
4006280	4009280	so that they would remind men of their butts.
4009280	4012280	That's called the genital echo theory.
4012280	4014280	That's just to put it in context.
4014280	4016280	To remind men of their own butts?
4016280	4021280	Like, a lot of founding fathers of theories that we end up building stuff on,
4021280	4023280	you know, you put it in context.
4023280	4025280	You're like, oh, you know what else Freud thought?
4025280	4026280	He thought this.
4026280	4029280	Like, you don't discount Freud, but it was a different time.
4029280	4032280	Anyways, that was the one book I read,
4032280	4036280	and the thing that really stuck with me was this idea of pair bonding
4036280	4038280	and neoteny.
4038280	4043280	He talked about how humanity was in the crosshairs of nature,
4043280	4046280	and we were going to be exterminated from the earth
4046280	4049280	if we didn't figure out a fucking way to survive,
4049280	4050280	and we had to do it through change,
4050280	4053280	and we had to start emulating the pack-hunting,
4053280	4056280	like, biological killing machines around us,
4056280	4063280	and as we did, we had to really hunker down and stop being like these bonobos.
4063280	4066280	He didn't, I don't know if he knew they were called bonobos or not,
4066280	4071280	but stop being like our forebears and start, like, making some changes,
4071280	4077280	and one of those changes was we got to focus on the brain biologically,
4077280	4082280	and because that makes a baby harder to take care of for a longer time,
4082280	4086280	we got to focus on pair bonding, so we got to fall in love,
4086280	4088280	and we got to look at each other, and we got to go,
4088280	4089280	I'm going to have a baby with you,
4089280	4092280	and when we have that baby with somebody, it's got to mean something,
4092280	4093280	and we got to stick with them,
4093280	4096280	and that that all came out of our advancement,
4096280	4099280	that as we started walking upright and as we lost our hair
4099280	4103280	and as we started learning to use tools and as we invented alphabets,
4103280	4107280	we were also learning to love each other precisely because our children,
4107280	4111280	our children until an unreasonable amount of time,
4111280	4115280	in the amount of time that it takes a kid to be able to beat off a wolf with a stick,
4115280	4117280	you can have a whole wolf.
4117280	4121280	That wolf that he's beating off with a stick is retiring,
4121280	4125280	and it's going like, I'm too old for this shit.
4126280	4130280	Humans live until they're a very, very old age,
4130280	4134280	and their childhood is largely spent being a gelatinous blob
4134280	4138280	of crying snotty garbage,
4138280	4142280	and so you need somebody to stick around and take care of it,
4142280	4146280	and so we took that direction away from the bonobos.
4146280	4148280	You don't just climb up in a tree.
4148280	4153280	You don't just hit the hills when you hear a distress call.
4154280	4158280	We took a different path, and part of that path was us going,
4158280	4159280	okay, you and me.
4159280	4160280	Hey, you, Cindy.
4160280	4161280	Okay, yes, Carl?
4161280	4162280	Yeah.
4162280	4163280	No matter what happens, right?
4163280	4164280	For real?
4164280	4165280	Okay.
4170280	4173280	That became, that the people that felt that way-
4173280	4174280	Cindy and Carl.
4174280	4176280	At the dawn of time.
4176280	4179280	That the people that felt that way,
4179280	4182280	and this is what's crazy, that's a crazy idea,
4183280	4187280	but then again, we have dogs shaped like corkscrews,
4187280	4189280	but they're more genetically malleable,
4189280	4194280	but the people that felt that way survived longer.
4194280	4197280	The humanity that survived the ice ages
4197280	4199280	and whatever the hell happened to us,
4199280	4202280	they were the people that coupled up and said,
4202280	4204280	I love Cindy.
4204280	4209280	But let's look at the unarticulated assumptions in that, right?
4210280	4212280	I don't think, I think what everything I said
4212280	4214280	was totally scientifically airtight.
4214280	4219280	I can't even begin to imagine in all the years of research.
4219280	4221280	Everything you said was articulated.
4221280	4222280	I'll give you that.
4225280	4229280	This is Little Pink House's theory of human evolution.
4229280	4230280	What is it?
4230280	4232280	Jack and Diane, right?
4232280	4233280	Cindy and Carl.
4233280	4235280	Yeah, Cindy and Carl, sorry.
4235280	4239280	What that assumes is that we evolved in nuclear families, right?
4239280	4242280	Casilda and I in our book, we call this Flintstone-ization,
4242280	4246280	this tendency to look around at the modern world
4246280	4249280	and project it into prehistory as a way to explain
4249280	4251280	and justify the way we are now.
4251280	4254280	The fact is, hunter-gatherers don't live in nuclear families.
4254280	4258280	They live in band-level societies of 150 people or fewer
4258280	4261280	in which they all take care of children.
4261280	4264280	So I certainly agree with you that two parents is better than one,
4264280	4265280	but you know what's even better?
4265280	4268280	15 parents, 20 parents.
4268280	4271280	And running around with a bunch of kids your age,
4271280	4275280	a little older than you, a 7-year-old respects the opinion
4275280	4278280	of a 10-year-old way more than the opinion of an adult.
4278280	4282280	So there are all sorts of things built into us as a species
4282280	4285280	that are resonant with band-level societies.
4285280	4290280	Casilda, who grew up in Africa, told me this beautiful expression,
4290280	4294280	the best place to store extra food is in your friend's stomach.
4294280	4296280	Makes perfect sense, right?
4296280	4298280	There was no refrigeration.
4298280	4301280	There was no accumulated resources.
4301280	4304280	So if you went out and you killed a deer and you came back
4304280	4306280	and you said, according to your Jack and Diane theory,
4306280	4310280	I'm only going to share this meat with my wife and my kids,
4310280	4313280	assuming you knew they were your kids somehow, you know?
4313280	4315280	Because you're out hunting.
4315280	4317280	How the hell do you know who she's fucking?
4317280	4321280	I have a really weirdly shaped penis.
4321280	4325280	There's absolutely no way the woman that meds with me successfully
4325280	4327280	could ever let another man.
4327280	4329280	That was my weird strain of biology.
4329280	4331280	Or like the Habsburgs.
4331280	4333280	It's like a weird strain of DNA.
4333280	4337280	It looks, a corkscrew, that's too simplistic
4337280	4340280	because that's like a lock that could be picked.
4340280	4345280	My penis looks like a common house key.
4346280	4348280	And so did my great-grandfathers.
4348280	4350280	What were you saying?
4350280	4352280	That's how I would know back then.
4352280	4355280	Anyway, the anthropological data is very clear
4355280	4358280	that hunter-gatherer people did not live in nuclear families.
4358280	4361280	They did not live in sexual-exclusive pair bonds.
4361280	4364280	So this theory that, well, the ones where the man stayed
4364280	4366280	and took care of the woman, well, first of all,
4366280	4368280	he didn't stay because he had to go hunting.
4368280	4371280	Secondly, the last thing he would do is share the meat only with his wife
4371280	4374280	because that would get them all kicked out of the damn band,
4374280	4377280	depending on for survival, sorry.
4377280	4380280	And then you look at anthropological data,
4380280	4382280	like, for example, in the Amazon and Papua New Guinea
4382280	4385280	and other parts of the world, there are a whole bunch of societies
4385280	4389280	that believe in something that anthropologists call partable paternity,
4389280	4392280	which is that we assume that everybody knew
4392280	4395280	that one sex act could result in a baby.
4395280	4396280	That's not true.
4396280	4398280	In fact, still today, lots of people don't know that.
4398280	4400280	Darwin didn't know that.
4401280	4405280	So these people believe that a fetus
4405280	4409280	is quite literally made of accumulated semen.
4409280	4412280	So a woman, sorry to gross you out,
4412280	4415280	but a woman who wants to have a baby, as all women do,
4415280	4417280	that's smart and funny and good-looking,
4417280	4419280	will have sex with the smart guy, the funny guy,
4419280	4423280	and the good-looking guy to get their semen into her fetus.
4423280	4426280	And then when she accumulates a certain amount of semen,
4426280	4428280	then it starts to become a baby.
4429280	4430280	And then when she has the baby,
4430280	4432280	all of these different men will come forward and say,
4432280	4434280	yeah, I'm a father.
4434280	4436280	And there are different words in the language
4436280	4439280	for the one who put it in, the one who spilled it out,
4439280	4441280	the one who mixed it around.
4444280	4447280	Yeah, it's like gang-bang porn in the Amazon.
4447280	4449280	I have a partial right now.
4454280	4456280	The one who mixed it around.
4457280	4458280	I don't want to be that guy.
4458280	4459280	I know.
4459280	4461280	That's the beta male of Papua New Guinea, right?
4461280	4462280	No.
4462280	4463280	No, you stirred it.
4463280	4465280	You stirred it.
4465280	4466280	Good job, Roger.
4466280	4467280	Go ahead, I'll be right there.
4467280	4469280	I want to be the guy that mixes it around.
4469280	4472280	I mean, Cletus is the reason he's tall,
4472280	4475280	and Tim's the reason he's smart, but...
4475280	4476280	Cletus.
4476280	4477280	You stirred him.
4477280	4478280	You stirred him together.
4478280	4481280	Everything starts with C, your tribe.
4482280	4484280	All right.
4484280	4486280	Well, I don't suppose either of you, too,
4486280	4488280	have anything to plug or anything
4488280	4490280	that make worth your time visiting us.
4490280	4492280	Lorraine, are you doing anything
4492280	4494280	that you want people to know about?
4494280	4496280	I want you to benefit from your time with her.
4496280	4497280	Let's see.
4497280	4501280	Well, watch Mylocalypse, watch Garfield,
4501280	4502280	watch...
4502280	4505280	No, you don't have to watch Doc McStuffins.
4505280	4506280	Doc McStuffins?
4506280	4507280	Yeah.
4507280	4509280	Tell me about that.
4510280	4512280	It's a reality show set in Papua New Guinea.
4512280	4513280	Yes.
4514280	4516280	And they all stuff it.
4516280	4518280	It's about the guy who just puts stuff in it.
4518280	4520280	They all stuff it.
4520280	4522280	I did an episode of Trophy Wife.
4522280	4523280	I don't know.
4523280	4526280	Yeah, I've got something called Box Trolls
4526280	4528280	coming out in 2014.
4528280	4530280	And what's Box Trolls?
4530280	4532280	Well, it's an animated feature,
4532280	4534280	it's an English movie.
4536280	4538280	So, well, I got...
4538280	4540280	I mean, you're shrugging it off,
4540280	4541280	but what the hell is this podcast?
4541280	4543280	I just want to make sure, yeah.
4543280	4545280	Because we're honored to have you here.
4545280	4547280	We missed you last time.
4547280	4549280	It really is a pleasure to have you.
4549280	4550280	You've been a hero of mine for a long time.
4550280	4552280	It's very cool to have you.
4557280	4561280	And when I say have you, I mean bonobo style.
4561280	4563280	And also come back any time.
4563280	4565280	That's a policy we have here.
4566280	4569280	Come hang out and you can take Jeff's place.
4569280	4571280	It doesn't matter.
4573280	4575280	I'm the guy that mixes it around.
4576280	4578280	Let's also thank Dr. Chris Ryan.
4578280	4580280	His podcast is called Tangentially Speaking.
4583280	4585280	Thank you guys.
4587280	4589280	These are our guests there.
4589280	4593280	I have a bad interviewer and a bad host.
4594280	4596280	I'm bad at dismissing people.
4601280	4603280	What's your book called?
4603280	4605280	Sex at Dawn.
4605280	4607280	That sounds like a Western.
4607280	4608280	I love that.
4608280	4610280	Sex at Dawn.
4610280	4611280	Sex at Dawn.
4611280	4613280	It's a threat and a promise.
4614280	4617280	Lorraine Newman and Dr. Chris Ryan, everybody.
4617280	4618280	Thank you.
4621280	4623280	First go to his podcast Tangentially Speaking,
4623280	4625280	which is a feral audio podcast,
4625280	4627280	which I'm sure if we listen to it,
4627280	4629280	it'd be like, oh man.
4632280	4633280	You know?
4633280	4634280	I'm afraid to listen to it.
4634280	4635280	Why?
4635280	4636280	Well, cuz he, you know, come on.
4636280	4637280	You say smart as...
4637280	4638280	The elephant in the room, yeah.
4638280	4639280	Yeah.
4639280	4640280	Yeah.
4640280	4641280	He's like me, but he read everything.
4641280	4643280	You know, not only is Dr. Ryan
4644280	4646280	sound like a fake doctor name.
4646280	4651280	Dr. Chris Ryan sounds like something on a soap opera.
4652280	4656280	He's smarter than you and me and everybody.
4656280	4661280	But he also, he speaks into the microphone way better than both of us.
4661280	4663280	He sounds like a fucking radio DJ.
4663280	4664280	Yeah.
4664280	4665280	Yeah.
4665280	4667280	And he sat there like he was fucking born there.
4667280	4669280	Like he just, he owned it.
4669280	4670280	But you know what?
4670280	4671280	Right behind...
4671280	4673280	Now he's glooming ominously right behind...
4676280	4677280	I like it.
4677280	4678280	I want a doctor over my shoulder.
4678280	4680280	I can refer to you in case...
4680280	4682280	Now he's caressing me tenderly.
4683280	4685280	I'm not a real doctor, though.
4686280	4687280	My wife is a real doctor.
4687280	4689280	If anyone has chest pains, talk to her.
4690280	4691280	Is that right?
4691280	4692280	What's your wife's name?
4692280	4693280	Casilda.
4693280	4694280	Casilda, and she wrote the book with you?
4694280	4695280	Yeah.
4695280	4697280	Why wouldn't she up on stage, you sexist motherfucker?
4698280	4702280	Which sort of hunter-gatherer bullshit is this?
4703280	4708280	Well, he never said that he was against anything that he observed.
4708280	4711280	He was like, yes, men own women.
4711280	4713280	He's sitting here missing right now,
4713280	4716280	thinking of which of the audience he's going to fuck later on.
4720280	4722280	And he's pointing at you.
4723280	4725280	He gave me a tender caress moments ago,
4725280	4727280	and it will not soon be forgotten.
4728280	4732280	Jeff, should we go to the moon or have a nuclear holocaust?
4733280	4734280	I would be honored...
4734280	4735280	I would say the first.
4735280	4739280	I would be honored if you would be the one that mixed it up.
4741280	4742280	Dan?
4742280	4743280	In my new family.
4743280	4745280	Dan, if he'll put it in, I'll mix it around.
4747280	4749280	Speaking of which, let's bring out Aaron McGathey.
4749280	4756280	From the World's Worst Segue Department.
4766280	4769280	Have you had any thoughts listening to all this?
4770280	4772280	Yeah, sure.
4772280	4775280	I have to say, I was really sleepy.
4775280	4776280	I love Dr. Christopher Ryan.
4776280	4778280	I've actually read his book, Sex at Dawn.
4778280	4781280	It was recommended to me before he had his podcast,
4781280	4783280	but I fell asleep for the last ten minutes.
4783280	4784280	Oh.
4784280	4785280	That was probably my fault.
4785280	4786280	No, no, no.
4786280	4788280	There was no boredom.
4788280	4790280	I was just sleepy and comfortable.
4790280	4792280	And there's an intern back there,
4792280	4794280	she complimented my dress and then fell asleep,
4794280	4796280	but I was like, I want to take a nap with her,
4796280	4798280	so I fell asleep too.
4798280	4800280	See, it's happening as he's talking.
4800280	4802280	Yeah, it's tribal.
4802280	4804280	You guys created a hammock back there.
4804280	4807280	Should I come back and mix it up?
4808280	4811280	Give it a little here and a little there.
4811280	4812280	Oh, whoever.
4812280	4817280	So women thought a baby was made by combined semen,
4817280	4820280	by fucking everybody, and a baby would turn out funny,
4820280	4822280	smart, tall, clever, this or that.
4822280	4824280	And there was one guy's job, just to get in there,
4824280	4827280	and I'm like, look, the baby's tall and clever.
4827280	4828280	I'm not.
4828280	4830280	I just mix it around.
4830280	4835280	I immediately thought I have a feeling that that title
4835280	4838280	was reserved for the guy that they couldn't figure it out.
4838280	4840280	They're like, oh, he's handsome like Tim,
4840280	4842280	and he's strong like Kyle.
4842280	4846280	And Steve, I'm sure you really made sure that Tim and Kyle
4846280	4851280	were both equally represented with the back and forth motion
4851280	4853280	of your tiny little plunger.
4853280	4856280	The way I heard that, that was not a beta male thing.
4856280	4857280	It was very alpha.
4857280	4858280	The guys looked like I went in there.
4858280	4859280	I was so secure.
4859280	4863280	I just went and mixed all that come up and fucking stirred it up.
4863280	4864280	Here's the crazy thing.
4864280	4868280	Do you ever wonder how the fuck did human beings ever figure this out?
4868280	4871280	Because I guess they had nothing else to think about
4871280	4873280	and no other data to collect.
4873280	4880280	But I just learned that with cats, that's actually true.
4880280	4883280	Like a couple different cats can fuck a female cat,
4883280	4887280	and a litter of kittens actually represent different...
4887280	4889280	So cool.
4889280	4891280	It's so neat.
4891280	4893280	You can have a whole baseball team.
4894280	4897280	How back then, I guess I kind of understand,
4897280	4900280	it's just amazing to think of what they were going through back then
4900280	4905280	at the dawn of our species and how they looked at men and women.
4905280	4908280	Well, I guess I'm...
4908280	4913280	First of all, figuring out that thing I do that I really want to do
4913280	4917280	and then that stuff that comes out when I finish doing it.
4917280	4920280	It's like, oh, that's like seeds.
4920280	4923280	And you're like dirt.
4923280	4928280	Because sometimes, like them making the correlation that nine months later sometimes...
4928280	4932280	Did you ever have a sex talk, like a formal sex talk?
4932280	4934280	No, my mom...
4934280	4937280	Did your dad hate you with a sex education book?
4937280	4942280	My mom said to me at one point that this is as close as verbatim as I could get
4942280	4944280	and I've apologized to my mom.
4944280	4945280	She's a great mom.
4945280	4949280	I don't think she listens to the podcast anymore, but...
4949280	4956280	My mom at one point said that sometimes when a man looks at a naked lady,
4956280	4962280	his penis gets excited and stands up and dances around
4962280	4966280	and then white stuff comes out of it.
4966280	4971280	And I went to the bathroom after watching Debbie Does Dallas
4971280	4973280	with my older brother.
4973280	4975280	He would invite the neighbor kids over to watch...
4975280	4977280	He would charge them to watch Debbie Does Dallas
4977280	4979280	because my dad had it on VHS.
4979280	4982280	It's a porn, you fucking 25-year-old.
4982280	4985280	You big sausage pizza generation.
4985280	4989280	We used to have story.
4989280	4993280	Debbie didn't want to do Dallas. She had to.
4993280	4997280	Mr. Greenfield earned it.
4997280	5006280	I was like pre-pubescent and watching because the big kids would watch it
5006280	5007280	and I went to the bathroom.
5007280	5009280	I've told this story a million times, but...
5009280	5011280	I went to the bathroom and I...
5011280	5012280	We all...
5012280	5013280	This is the 70s.
5013280	5014280	Everyone had tiny, whitey briefs.
5014280	5015280	That's all you were.
5015280	5022280	And there was some cotton lint on my wee-wee that I was absolutely certain.
5022280	5024280	I looked at it as I was going to the bathroom and I went,
5024280	5028280	oh my God, my penis got up and danced around
5028280	5032280	because I looked at a naked lady and that's the white stuff that came out.
5032280	5035280	Did you think there was a man in your penis?
5035280	5036280	Like the Shining?
5036280	5040280	I thought that my penis was like a man that danced around.
5040280	5042280	Yes. I'm not kidding.
5042280	5044280	That's how she described it to me.
5044280	5047280	I grew up in a very religious family when I was six years old.
5047280	5052280	My mom and I went to a carnival and I don't remember the details from the carnival.
5052280	5054280	I remember when we got in the car, I had...
5054280	5058280	I was holding a $5 bill or...
5058280	5060280	Oh, which one is Lincoln on?
5060280	5061280	Five.
5061280	5062280	Yeah. Okay.
5062280	5063280	I'm just double checking.
5063280	5066280	So I was holding this $5 bill and we lived in Italy
5066280	5068280	and I didn't have like American money, but at this...
5068280	5069280	Or a penny. It could have been a penny.
5069280	5073280	It was a bill and I hadn't really seen American money
5073280	5076280	and I was like, ah, this guy, like to get on this bill,
5076280	5077280	we're driving home.
5077280	5078280	I'm like five or six years old.
5078280	5079280	It's amazing.
5079280	5080280	Like he got on this bill.
5080280	5082280	Like where did he come from?
5082280	5089280	And my mom said, well, when two people love each other very much,
5089280	5092280	the female will arouse the man so his penis...
5092280	5093280	Wait.
5093280	5094280	It becomes an erect...
5094280	5095280	Yeah.
5095280	5096280	Why?
5096280	5098280	I was like, I don't know.
5098280	5102280	What dots was she connecting there?
5102280	5104280	I think she was just waiting for it.
5104280	5105280	She was really excited.
5105280	5108280	My mom was very like academic
5108280	5110280	and she was waiting for her chance to tell me about sex.
5110280	5114280	Also, she always liked scaring me, I think.
5114280	5116280	I was just like, this guy.
5116280	5118280	Bill, what a night at the carnival.
5118280	5121280	Like I remember, I remember as she was explaining this to me,
5121280	5125280	I remember looking at fireworks going off in the background
5125280	5129280	as she was saying, well, when a man and a woman love each other very much,
5129280	5132280	the woman will arouse a man so his penis becomes erect,
5132280	5133280	hard like a stick.
5133280	5137280	And then the stick goes inside.
5137280	5140280	Inside the woman and if he's excited enough,
5140280	5145280	his ejaculate will go into her and if it fertilizes the egg...
5145280	5150280	She called the dick a stick, but she used the word ejaculate?
5150280	5153280	It's a weird term to get clinical.
5153280	5155280	Well, our dog was named an ejaculate.
5155280	5156280	Okay.
5156280	5158280	And I just...
5158280	5161280	We sat in silence for the way home and she kept on asking me if I was okay
5161280	5162280	and I was like, it was fine.
5162280	5165280	But I misunderstood the talk and I thought that...
5165280	5167280	And I think a lot of kids think this.
5167280	5173280	I thought that the penis detached and you plugged it in like a gas hose.
5173280	5174280	So that's what I was thinking.
5174280	5175280	A gas hose?
5175280	5179280	Well, like I thought I imagined my...
5179280	5181280	A gas pump.
5181280	5183280	I was imagining my parents lying next to each other
5183280	5185280	and my dad being like,
5185280	5188280	Honey, is it time for another McGathey child?
5188280	5192280	And him just being...
5192280	5196280	My mom being like, yay, a baby!
5196280	5201280	All because I was celebrating Abraham Lincoln being on the bill.
5201280	5204280	Meanwhile, I thought women had nothing to do with...
5204280	5210280	When a man looks at a woman, his penis is like just goes, whoa!
5210280	5213280	You guys are lunatics.
5213280	5215280	How does a bill become a law?
5215280	5217280	Well, when a man loves a woman,
5217280	5220280	his penis turns into a man, detaches like a gas hose
5220280	5222280	and pours ejaculate into her.
5222280	5226280	I do remember when I was six years old as we were driving home
5226280	5228280	and I had the presence of mine to be like,
5228280	5230280	this is fucking crazy that she told me about this.
5230280	5233280	I really feel like this is too soon.
5233280	5236280	By the way, I wasn't allowed to watch an R-rated movie until I was 17.
5236280	5239280	So I knew everything but nothing at the same time.
5239280	5242280	But I had this moment where I was like, just remember.
5242280	5243280	Just remember this.
5243280	5246280	Whenever you look at Abraham Lincoln or a $5 bill,
5246280	5249280	you're going to remember where you were.
5249280	5252280	This is the first time that you are making a memory.
5252280	5253280	That was my thing.
5253280	5255280	I was like, this is my first memory.
5255280	5257280	Which doesn't make any sense.
5257280	5259280	But still, every time I look at a $5 bill,
5259280	5261280	I think about my mom and my dad fucking...
5261280	5264280	The first time you were scarred.
5264280	5267280	Yeah, well, that was not the first time.
5267280	5269280	All right, come on, heavens.
5269280	5270280	Yeah, come on.
5270280	5271280	Damn.
5271280	5275280	Dan, I think I may have taken my nap before because I've...
5275280	5277280	You slept during a fucking fascinating interview.
5277280	5278280	Oh, no, no, I loved it.
5278280	5281280	So when you're back there before the show, you're just snoozing?
5281280	5282280	No, no, no, it wasn't for very long.
5282280	5285280	It was really because there was a nice lady who complimented my dress
5285280	5287280	and I just wanted to take it back with her.
5287280	5289280	I mean, that's really what happened.
5289280	5291280	Thank you.
5291280	5293280	No, I think you were just tired.
5293280	5295280	I was also just tired.
5295280	5299280	But Dan is meeting my extended family on Wednesday,
5299280	5301280	my very southern extended family,
5301280	5303280	and I started thinking about how soon that is
5303280	5305280	and I started getting really nervous and overwhelmed.
5305280	5308280	So I've been distracted by that.
5308280	5311280	But not in a bad way and in an exciting way.
5314280	5316280	Did it make you sleepy?
5316280	5318280	Don't you get overwhelmed and then sleepy?
5318280	5319280	Yeah.
5319280	5322280	Okay, let's get Spencer up here.
5322280	5323280	21 minutes.
5323280	5325280	Spencer, get up here.
5327280	5331280	Here comes Cranky Spencer.
5331280	5333280	Here comes Cranky Underdog Spencer.
5333280	5334280	What was that?
5335280	5338280	Oh, it's not enough time to play property indeed.
5338280	5339280	I love that.
5339280	5342280	I love not having to write new things next week.
5343280	5345280	He is truly my protege.
5348280	5351280	I've been training him in the art of not liking work.
5351280	5354280	Spencer, I don't think I'm speaking out of school
5354280	5357280	when I say that you're going to be in an episode of Community, right?
5357280	5359280	Yeah, yeah.
5360280	5361280	Am I dead?
5361280	5364280	It was also mentioned a couple of weeks ago on the show.
5364280	5366280	Yeah, we talked about it in a link.
5367280	5369280	I was not there.
5369280	5371280	Did you enjoy your experience on camera?
5371280	5372280	I had to think about that.
5372280	5373280	Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed it.
5373280	5374280	I enjoyed it.
5374280	5376280	You know, I think two weeks ago,
5376280	5379280	we also said Danny and Allison.
5379280	5380280	So they were really nice to me.
5380280	5382280	They were really nice to me.
5382280	5383280	I'm awkward.
5383280	5385280	I don't talk to people.
5385280	5386280	I don't make eye contact.
5386280	5387280	I don't know what to say.
5387280	5389280	I don't know what I'm saying right now,
5389280	5393280	but they made me feel like almost a regular person,
5393280	5396280	and more than that, almost a regular person
5396280	5398280	that might have supposed to have been there.
5398280	5399280	Wow.
5399280	5400280	Yeah, and it was amazing.
5400280	5402280	Spencer, whether you like it or not,
5402280	5404280	you've been thrust into the limelight,
5404280	5408280	and you've become a beloved national treasure, right?
5408280	5409280	I'd like to think so.
5410280	5412280	All right, now do your job.
5414280	5415280	Get those character sheets out.
5415280	5418280	Roll your dice, dice boy.
5418280	5421280	Spencer, I haven't played D&D in a few weeks.
5421280	5423280	I want you to know that I've really been thinking about my character
5423280	5424280	the last couple of weeks,
5424280	5427280	and this is going to be really good from me,
5427280	5430280	that I'm going to be very committed to my character,
5430280	5431280	and I'm going to really play this.
5431280	5433280	I'm not going to be stupid.
5433280	5435280	I'm going to hold you to that.
5435280	5436280	Please do.
5436280	5438280	I have to pee so bad.
5438280	5439280	We got this.
5439280	5440280	Just go.
5440280	5441280	It'll be quick.
5441280	5442280	We'll cover it, Dan.
5442280	5443280	No, no, no.
5444280	5446280	I'll play your snoring while you're peeing.
5446280	5447280	Do you want that?
5449280	5450280	But then that's the whole show.
5450280	5451280	That's the closing.
5451280	5452280	No, no, we'll play it.
5452280	5453280	We'll talk about it next week.
5453280	5454280	Aaron recorded me snoring.
5455280	5456280	Let's save that.
5456280	5457280	Go pee.
5458280	5460280	Should we play snoring while you pee?
5460280	5461280	Just while he's peeing.
5461280	5462280	Go pee.
5467280	5469280	Get the hell out of here.
5469280	5470280	It's 9.41.
5470280	5472280	Let's see how long it takes Dan to pee.
5474280	5475280	I have two videos.
5475280	5476280	I have a video of Dan snoring,
5476280	5480280	and then I taped him while I was trying to gently adjust him
5480280	5481280	and what he said to me.
5481280	5482280	Gently adjust him.
5482280	5484280	Well, because if he's lying in a certain position,
5484280	5485280	he snorts really loud,
5485280	5486280	but any other position he's fine.
5486280	5488280	So I was just trying to move the pillow a little bit,
5488280	5489280	but this is him snoring.
5489280	5491280	Will the audio work here?
5491280	5492280	One helps.
5494280	5495280	Five.
5495280	5496280	Five.
5503280	5504280	Five.
5507280	5508280	A wildebeest.
5515280	5516280	So this goes on for a very long time,
5516280	5521280	and I'm going to play the audio of me just trying to move this pillow
5521280	5524280	so he could stop snoring.
5529280	5530280	Hey.
5531280	5532280	What's wrong with you?
5535280	5536280	All right.
5536280	5537280	I'm going to pause it.
5541280	5543280	I'd like to say that I didn't get it very good.
5543280	5546280	If I remember dating somebody, and I am right now,
5546280	5547280	if I snore like that,
5547280	5549280	I would want somebody to fucking put a bullet in my head.
5552280	5556280	I mean, Dan has been working such long hard hours on community
5556280	5557280	and is so tired.
5557280	5559280	He's working so, so, so hard.
5559280	5561280	And this was, I mean, he's barely ever home.
5561280	5563280	He sleeps at the office.
5563280	5565280	And last night, he kept me up.
5565280	5567280	And this is, I wasn't angry, but kept me up.
5567280	5568280	Dance back, everybody.
5568280	5569280	Dance back.
5569280	5571280	Shit, a minute and a half, not bad at all.
5571280	5572280	He was snoring so loud.
5572280	5574280	The trick is I didn't wash my hands.
5577280	5578280	Stick them in my mouth.
5578280	5579280	Stick your hands in my mouth.
5580280	5582280	Sorry, cue from home.
5583280	5586280	He was snoring so loud that he kept on waking himself up with his snoring
5586280	5588280	and be like, what, what, Aaron, what?
5588280	5589280	Did you hear it?
5589280	5590280	Did you play it?
5590280	5591280	No, no.
5591280	5592280	Well, I'm going to start laughing.
5592280	5593280	You couldn't hear it from the bathroom?
5593280	5594280	You pee that loud?
5594280	5595280	You couldn't hear your own snoring?
5595280	5596280	So really quick, this is 45 seconds.
5596280	5598280	We'll have to hold our breath because it's pretty quiet,
5598280	5600280	and then we can laugh after it.
5600280	5601280	There's nothing wrong with you.
5601280	5602280	Nothing.
5602280	5603280	You're snoring all day.
5603280	5604280	Oh, okay.
5604280	5605280	Okay.
5605280	5608280	You know, I'm not, I don't want to fight.
5608280	5611280	I don't want to do anything wrong.
5611280	5614280	I just need you to understand.
5614280	5617280	Do you have any idea how little sleep I've given her?
5617280	5618280	I know.
5618280	5619280	I'm so sorry.
5619280	5620280	You're just...
5620280	5623280	If I do something wrong...
5623280	5624280	It's not anything wrong.
5624280	5626280	It's an adjustment.
5626280	5628280	I just need you to understand.
5628280	5630280	I'm sorry.
5630280	5631280	It's okay.
5631280	5632280	It's okay.
5633280	5634280	It's no sleep happening.
5634280	5635280	I don't know.
5641280	5642280	Okay.
5642280	5644280	Low level sitting Nancy.
5647280	5648280	I'm like, keep snoring.
5648280	5649280	It's fine.
5649280	5650280	Keep snoring.
5650280	5651280	Listen.
5651280	5652280	Listen.
5652280	5654280	I may be asleep right now,
5654280	5657280	but I want to wring your soul like a fucking rag.
5657280	5659280	I'm going to drink every drop.
5661280	5663280	I don't know if you understand while I'm sleeping,
5663280	5667280	how much energy you need to put into me sleeping.
5668280	5669280	Yeah.
5669280	5670280	I'm sorry.
5670280	5671280	I'm so sorry.
5671280	5672280	I wake up feeling terrible.
5672280	5674280	Because the truth is, honestly,
5674280	5676280	that was a weird night.
5676280	5678280	That was a weird night of catching up on a lot of shit.
5678280	5681280	And I hope that was unusual.
5682280	5683280	It was.
5683280	5684280	It was unusual.
5684280	5685280	No.
5685280	5686280	I mean, that's the reason why I taped up.
5686280	5688280	I don't have a backlog of...
5688280	5689280	What if?
5689280	5690280	What if I did?
5690280	5691280	I'll start doing that.
5691280	5692280	Also, if I...
5692280	5694280	Look, I don't want to think that I snore.
5694280	5695280	Maybe I do.
5695280	5696280	Maybe I don't.
5696280	5697280	I have a video of you.
5697280	5699280	I wouldn't want someone to fucking record me.
5699280	5701280	Don't record me while I'm fucking sleeping.
5701280	5702280	I don't mind.
5702280	5703280	I actually...
5703280	5704280	I'm kind of interested in that.
5704280	5705280	Oh, no.
5705280	5707280	It's the one thing you'll never hear.
5707280	5708280	It's so interesting.
5708280	5711280	It's really like you and your most...
5711280	5712280	I used to paint my dad.
5712280	5714280	It's like seeing the back of your head in a mirror.
5714280	5716280	It's like this weird...
5716280	5720280	That's what I sound like when my body is...
5720280	5721280	I don't know.
5721280	5722280	It's weird.
5722280	5724280	Spencer, let's play a little D&D, shall we?
5724280	5725280	Yeah.
5725280	5726280	Yeah.
5728280	5730280	Last time on Harmon Town.
5730280	5734280	You know the thing about that Meerkats show?
5734280	5735280	Sorry.
5735280	5738280	You invite me here.
5738280	5740280	You tell me to do stuff.
5740280	5741280	Sorry.
5741280	5742280	It's cool.
5742280	5744280	What's on everyone's Christmas list?
5746280	5747280	Silence.
5747280	5750280	I feel like Hollywood has changed, Spencer.
5751280	5757280	I think being comfortable here has changed me into being less agreeable in general.
5757280	5760280	Which is my natural state, to be fair.
5760280	5764280	You're starting to realize that what you're doing is technically labor.
5765280	5767280	I mean, starting to?
5768280	5771280	For Christmas, I'm getting Spencer a belt that's just one of the...
5771280	5772280	Is that table?
5774280	5775280	I don't get it.
5776280	5777280	He will.
5777280	5781280	Spencer, just to change things up, I want you to do an intro D&D,
5781280	5784280	but I want you to do it to old-timey strip tease music.
5787280	5790280	If it doesn't give us a boner, you did it wrong.
5791280	5793280	But I've already failed.
5795280	5796280	I don't even know.
5796280	5799280	So welcome to the stage, Spicy Spencer.
5800280	5802280	And I'm already here.
5808280	5812280	For the podcast, all lights have been cut, except to me.
5813280	5815280	I don't know what's happening.
5815280	5816280	It's called the special.
5816280	5817280	You have your light now.
5817280	5818280	It's called burlesque.
5818280	5819280	It's Hollywood, man.
5819280	5821280	Take your fucking shirt off.
5823280	5824280	You want fame?
5824280	5827280	Well, fame costs, and right now is where you start paying.
5827280	5829280	You don't want any of this.
5830280	5832280	I never did.
5833280	5837280	I just want a poor vodka and sit in a corner.
5838280	5839280	Do it.
5839280	5840280	Okay.
5840280	5842280	How much time do we have left on this music, Jeff?
5842280	5843280	Just two minutes.
5843280	5844280	All right.
5844280	5847280	Last time on Harmon Town, nothing happened.
5850280	5852280	I will... I will leave.
5855280	5857280	I mean, honestly.
5858280	5860280	It's your guy's name on this.
5860280	5861280	Yeah, come on.
5861280	5864280	Well, it's just one person, same.
5864280	5865280	I mean, sure.
5865280	5871280	I think we're just feeling guilty that we ran up the clock, as usual.
5871280	5873280	So we're trying to make a joke out of it.
5873280	5879280	Sometimes when it's dark, I kick my cat, because I just bump into it.
5879280	5885280	And I don't think, oh, sorry, let me kick you a whole bunch more times while laughing gleefully.
5886280	5888280	That'll solve this problem.
5888280	5893280	Well, does your cat seem like part of him kind of likes it a little bit?
5895280	5897280	Depending on where you kick it.
5897280	5898280	Oh, yeah.
5898280	5900280	I have a socks on.
5902280	5904280	What minute 20 left on this track, Spencer?
5904280	5905280	Yeah.
5905280	5907280	And this is what, take four?
5908280	5909280	All right.
5909280	5914280	Last week on Harmon Town, as I said before, literally nothing happened.
5914280	5916280	There was, you know, it was a different Harmon Town.
5916280	5917280	No, no D&D happened.
5917280	5918280	Oh, right, right.
5918280	5922280	But the time before that, however, our heroes were locked in combat with Admiral Darkstar.
5922280	5929280	You see, the climactic, anticlimactic combat involved face-sitting wiresaws and dismemberment discussions
5929280	5931280	on the seemingly helpless Admiral.
5931280	5935280	And after attempting to reason with the Dark Lord, he revealed that where he killed,
5935280	5939280	he'd grow much more powerful, perhaps more than they'd ever imagine.
5939280	5945280	But heeding not Darkstar's words, our heroes settled on decapitating him via wiresaw.
5945280	5948280	And Christoper began his grisly work.
5948280	5952280	As he sawed, a foul oozing miasma began spewing from the dark armor,
5952280	5955280	filling the room with a vortex of evil energy.
5955280	5957280	But after a moment, it dissipated.
5957280	5961280	Our heroes began to celebrate their victory, but their jubilations were cut short
5961280	5965280	by a massive metal claw bursting forth from the floor below.
5965280	5972280	A four-fingered ferris fist snatched Quark and lifted him high into the air in its cold clutches.
5973280	5975280	And yeah, that's what's happening.
5977280	5980280	Eleven minutes. Eleven minutes of real playing.
5980280	5982280	It's going to be the most intense real playing you've ever had.
5982280	5986280	Okay, so I'm being held up in a big fist.
5986280	5991280	Yeah, so you thought you killed this guy, and then all of a sudden this hand bursts out of the ground
5991280	5997280	cracking the stone floors all around you, and it grabs Quark and lifts him up in the air,
5997280	6000280	like some sort of thing holding Quark up in the air.
6001280	6002280	No!
6002280	6004280	I try to wrestle myself free.
6004280	6006280	All right, that's probably a good opening move.
6006280	6008280	Yeah.
6008280	6010280	That doesn't happen.
6010280	6016280	You try to squirm out of its grip, but it's vice-like claws hold you tight in place.
6017280	6019280	Help me!
6019280	6021280	Teleport, cloak.
6023280	6024280	Yeah, yeah.
6024280	6029280	Yeah, up to the top of the thumb of the hand holding my friend.
6029280	6032280	You wave your teleport cloak and it gives a...
6033280	6036280	It seems like it's run out for the day.
6040280	6045280	Quark, I'm going to put on my boots of springing.
6046280	6047280	Okay.
6047280	6048280	Okay.
6049280	6052280	You relax, save your energy. You look very weak.
6052280	6054280	I'm being crushed by a giant hand.
6054280	6056280	Yeah, I know. Shush.
6057280	6063280	I put on my boots of springing, and I take a deep breath.
6063280	6067280	And, you know, in baseball players, if they make eye contact with something, it works better.
6067280	6069280	So I do that.
6069280	6071280	Big jump. I use my boots of springing.
6071280	6072280	To try and jump.
6072280	6078280	To try and jump up and release him, because I have a whole basket of crafts and a lot of ideas.
6078280	6080280	I just got to get up there.
6080280	6081280	All right.
6081280	6084280	You spring spryly atop the hand.
6084280	6088280	You land between the second and third fingers, kind of on the joint of this hand.
6088280	6093280	You're kind of standing above where Quark is with your basket of crafts.
6093280	6097280	All right. I'm about to destroy your handiwork, sir.
6099280	6101280	No, no, no, no.
6103280	6104280	I liked it.
6104280	6106280	Can I do anything else?
6106280	6110280	What do you want to try? It depends. You could start doing something else, to be sure.
6111280	6116280	Okay. I'm going to prepare something for my next move, which will be...
6116280	6118280	I'm being crushed by the hand.
6123280	6125280	I'm going to...
6125280	6128280	I sit there while I'm being crushed, and I watch her prepare something.
6129280	6131280	Do I have antifreeze?
6132280	6133280	No.
6133280	6134280	Okay.
6134280	6135280	You have cheese.
6136280	6137280	All right.
6137280	6141280	Is it about our other game where I have all the cheese, or I have a lot of cheese here, too?
6141280	6143280	It's a craft supply.
6143280	6145280	Oh, okay. Interesting.
6145280	6147280	I could hear Adam getting that.
6147280	6148280	Yeah, it's a good joke.
6148280	6149280	Okay.
6149280	6161280	I take out two pieces of plastic sheeting from my craft area and...
6161280	6163280	Hey, R-A-F-T.
6166280	6168280	We've released Adam.
6168280	6170280	So put a nickel in, Adam.
6170280	6177280	I take out two sheets of plastic sheeting, the cheese, some string, and a hole punch.
6177280	6178280	Stay tuned.
6178280	6179280	All right.
6179280	6181280	Plastic doesn't exist.
6181280	6182280	What?
6182280	6183280	Plastic doesn't exist.
6183280	6184280	Plastic doesn't exist.
6184280	6187280	Either just preparing stuff for the next round.
6187280	6189280	Okay, well, then I'll wait for my next turn.
6189280	6190280	All right.
6190280	6192280	I'll put it at Dan's turn, since it's magical light.
6192280	6194280	No, I want to do a bunch of stuff.
6195280	6197280	Gashes form.
6198280	6201280	Waving your arms around, you dissipate into a gas.
6201280	6203280	Dis-a-pa-tus-form-a-tus.
6206280	6210280	You now occupy the room like some sort of fog or mist.
6210280	6211280	Yeah.
6211280	6212280	Yeah.
6212280	6213280	Guess what?
6213280	6216280	I'm moving up into this robot's face.
6216280	6219280	Well, there's only the claw.
6219280	6220280	Oh, the claw?
6220280	6221280	Okay, I assume...
6221280	6223280	I projected a robot with my mind.
6224280	6226280	Who's to say there's not a robot?
6226280	6227280	All right.
6227280	6229280	I mean, a big robot hand came up, grabbed my friend.
6229280	6230280	Yeah.
6230280	6231280	All right.
6231280	6232280	I'm a gaseous form.
6232280	6233280	Yeah.
6233280	6235280	I'm going to...
6235280	6236280	Can I do something?
6236280	6238280	You can exist in a gaseous state.
6238280	6240280	What does a gas do?
6240280	6241280	It dissipates.
6241280	6243280	It sits.
6243280	6245280	You can't do anything as a gas, dude.
6247280	6248280	I can't move?
6248280	6249280	Well, you're a gas.
6249280	6250280	You're a gas.
6250280	6251280	Yeah, you could drift.
6251280	6255280	Please make a t-shirt for dam that says exists in a gaseous state.
6256280	6257280	I can't move.
6257280	6260280	Dan, the one who casted blasted.
6260280	6261280	Dumb.
6261280	6262280	Dumb.
6262280	6265280	Yeah, you can drift around, but yeah, that's about it.
6265280	6268280	I drift around to the robot's face.
6268280	6269280	I'm being crushed by a hand.
6269280	6273280	You guys are putting on plastic and cheese and turning into farts.
6273280	6277280	I drift down through the hole that the hand came up through.
6277280	6278280	Help my brother.
6278280	6279280	Okay.
6279280	6282280	I'm going down through the hole that the hand came up through.
6282280	6283280	That makes sense.
6283280	6284280	Yeah.
6284280	6285280	I get it now.
6285280	6286280	Does it?
6286280	6287280	Yeah.
6287280	6288280	It makes more sense.
6288280	6290280	It makes 80s hero sense.
6290280	6292280	Flowing through the cracks in the floor.
6292280	6297280	You go down a level and there you see a giant robot man.
6297280	6298280	See?
6298280	6301280	With his arm through the ceiling.
6301280	6305280	I get up in his grill.
6305280	6308280	You surround his face gaseously.
6308280	6309280	Yeah.
6309280	6312280	Now you become a 90s hero.
6312280	6315280	Welcome to Earth.
6315280	6316280	Quark.
6316280	6321280	The claw starts flailing around and it smacks Chris.
6321280	6322280	No, Quark.
6322280	6323280	Sorry.
6323280	6324280	Sorry, Quark.
6324280	6327280	Into the ground all body slam style or something.
6327280	6329280	Does he release him?
6329280	6330280	Flice watch style.
6330280	6331280	Yeah.
6331280	6335280	I mean, he opens his fingers so that he could get the crushing thing going on.
6335280	6336280	Get out of there.
6336280	6337280	Yeah.
6337280	6338280	He does, actually.
6338280	6339280	I get out of there?
6339280	6345280	At the last second as the fingers open, you dive out of the way and miss being squashed
6345280	6346280	very narrowly.
6346280	6351280	It's because I'm nimble as a fucking mountain goat.
6351280	6352280	What am I doing?
6352280	6353280	Because I was...
6353280	6355280	You're preparing crafts, I believe.
6355280	6356280	Yeah.
6356280	6358280	Am I still on the fingers?
6358280	6362280	You'd be in front of the fingers at this point.
6362280	6363280	I've been what?
6363280	6367280	You're now in front of the fingers on the floor as the fingers are on the floor.
6367280	6368280	I say okay.
6368280	6369280	Like that.
6369280	6370280	Yeah.
6370280	6371280	Like that.
6371280	6372280	Is that my turn?
6372280	6373280	For the podcast.
6373280	6374280	Yeah.
6374280	6375280	Barbarian rage.
6375280	6376280	Mighty sword attack on the hand.
6376280	6381280	I try to slice the veins on his wrist like a cutter.
6381280	6385280	Bleed this dick real slow.
6385280	6391280	As I do it, I take my sword and I go, I'll make you leak, Jack.
6391280	6394280	Wait, so are you quipping widdly or raging?
6394280	6396280	I quip ragely.
6396280	6397280	Okay.
6397280	6403280	The true meaning of what you were trying to say doesn't come across entirely, but being
6403280	6409280	a robot hand, you don't suspect it matters, but you slice into his finger with your mighty
6409280	6411280	sword and cleave one off.
6411280	6412280	It seems to do...
6412280	6413280	I went for the wrist.
6413280	6414280	I went for the wrist.
6414280	6415280	Oh, the wrist?
6415280	6417280	Well, you don't cleave it off then.
6417280	6419280	You do just deal some serious damage.
6419280	6420280	All right.
6420280	6422280	Is there extras 1D6s on you?
6422280	6423280	This is so boring.
6423280	6424280	Anybody got 1D6?
6424280	6425280	Talking about math.
6425280	6427280	It's 2D8 plus 8.
6427280	6428280	Yeah.
6428280	6429280	I got you.
6429280	6430280	Chris 19 to 20 times 2.
6430280	6432280	He's asking for a dice.
6432280	6433280	Yeah, for dice.
6433280	6434280	No, I got the dice.
6434280	6435280	I got the dice.
6435280	6436280	Sweet.
6436280	6437280	You always got the dice.
6437280	6438280	22 damage.
6438280	6439280	Fuck yeah.
6439280	6440280	Oh.
6440280	6441280	Oh.
6441280	6442280	Freak out.
6442280	6443280	All right.
6443280	6446280	Is it back on me?
6446280	6449280	Were you just trying to end the show?
6449280	6450280	No, no, no.
6450280	6454280	I thought that you were like, yes, yes, and then everyone just killed the momentum.
6454280	6455280	No, no, no, no.
6455280	6456280	Fuck.
6456280	6457280	I end the show.
6457280	6458280	I would do this till 11.
6458280	6459280	I...
6459280	6461280	I'm going to find their limit.
6461280	6470080	I take the supplies that I had gathered before, not plastic, string and cheese.
6470080	6474720	I make eye contact with the room.
6474720	6483160	I smash it and I put on my armulet of summer, my flaming armor that can heat up metal.
6483160	6484160	Yeah.
6484160	6485160	That's you guys.
6485160	6486160	So good.
6486160	6487160	So good.
6487160	6490160	We'll edit their silence out.
6490160	6502880	So with my armulet of summer, which I'm assuming like fires up, so it looks like I'm on fire.
6502880	6503880	Right?
6503880	6506240	Not completely human torched, but pretty much there.
6506240	6507240	Okay.
6507240	6508240	All right.
6508240	6509240	Hey, look!
6509240	6511080	I say to my friends.
6511080	6513880	And then I am going to charge the...
6513880	6515800	Can I charge the...
6515800	6518080	Is the heart exposed on this floor?
6518080	6519080	Not from this floor.
6519080	6522520	You'd have to pop down to the lower level there.
6522520	6524960	All you have is the hand coming up through the floor right now.
6524960	6525960	Yeah.
6525960	6526960	Okay.
6526960	6530760	Well, I guess I'll go ahead and pop down, but can I pop down by sliding down the neck
6530760	6532160	like a Ghostbusters pole?
6532160	6533160	No.
6533160	6534160	Okay.
6534160	6535160	Yeah.
6535160	6536160	You can.
6536160	6537160	It's just the arm, not the neck.
6537160	6538160	Right.
6538160	6539160	Okay.
6539160	6540160	But yeah, definitely.
6540160	6541160	Okay.
6541160	6542160	All right.
6542160	6546240	I'm going to slide down the arm, but I'm going to nuzzle it as I go down so as to create
6546240	6548480	as much damage as possible.
6548480	6552760	With the damaging nuzzle, you slide down the metal arm.
6552760	6559160	It doesn't seem to do very much because it's metal, but you do slide down the arm and find
6559160	6563440	yourself on its shoulder right next to the giant robotic head.
6563440	6564960	Cool.
6564960	6566600	You got an attack action or something.
6566600	6567600	Oh, I do?
6567600	6574840	Oh, well then I'll take my flaming arrows and I will fire my flaming arrows into one
6574840	6585480	into the robot's eye and the other into his neck because he'll be like, what is happening?
6585480	6588520	You fire your arrows at point blank range.
6588520	6594760	They both smash into the head, except one of them seems to like bounce off the head
6594760	6596680	and it just blinks off the armor.
6596680	6600520	The other, however, pierces through and goes into the brain.
6600520	6602440	You can see, I mean the robot brain.
6602440	6603720	I don't know what you call that.
6603720	6604720	A computer.
6604720	6606680	Has a tranic module.
6606680	6614160	Which doesn't exist in D and D. However, according to Asimov, it's the soul matrix.
6614160	6620240	The soul matrix emits sparks and he takes 12 damage.
6620240	6621240	Brain damage though.
6621240	6622240	That's fire.
6622240	6632480	And I say, I'm on fire.
6632480	6634560	The laziest mic drop of all time.
6634560	6638920	Well, I don't want to hurt the mic.
6638920	6642080	But you thought you could do damage by nuzzling?
6643000	6644000	Oh, well.
6644000	6646000	Irene, have you ever slept next to Dan Harmon?
6646000	6648000	Hello!
6648000	6654000	Look, I don't want you to, I don't want to get in a fight.
6654000	6658000	I just need you to understand how high the stakes are when I'm sleeping.
6658000	6661120	Also, the night before, where's the treasure?
6661120	6663120	The treasure's the, you just gotta get in the treasure.
6663120	6665120	It's the treasure!
6665120	6667120	I was talking about treasure.
6667120	6669120	I was breaking the finale story.
6669120	6671120	In my sleep.
6671160	6673160	You're welcome.
6673160	6675160	That's how hard I work.
6675160	6677160	Guys, we're close to the finish time.
6677160	6679160	We have to come up with a cliffhanger here.
6679160	6680160	Let's focus.
6680160	6682160	Sharpie's turn.
6682160	6686160	Alright, so I'm gaseous for him and I'm up in this guy's grill.
6686160	6688160	Or that t-shirt.
6688160	6690160	Okay, so here's the thing.
6690160	6694160	I'm going around the back of his neck.
6694160	6696160	This is what I do.
6696160	6698160	This is my thing.
6698160	6702160	I'm gonna stop being gaseous for him.
6702160	6706160	And I'm just gonna be on his neck.
6706160	6708160	Now wait.
6708160	6714160	Can I, can I go into his body because I'm gaseous?
6714160	6716160	Yes.
6718160	6722160	Can I edit the podcast to make it seem like I knew that already?
6722160	6724160	Yes.
6724160	6726160	I'm thinking, oh, I'm gaseous.
6726160	6730160	I should, I should be on his left shoulder.
6730160	6734160	I go inside his robot body as a gaseous form.
6734160	6735160	Holy shit.
6735160	6736160	Okay, that happened.
6736160	6738160	You're like Dennis Quaid in Inner Space.
6738160	6739160	Yeah.
6739160	6744160	I'm like the left half of Timothy Hutton in The Dark Half.
6746160	6748160	Thud.
6748160	6752160	That's Timothy Hutton's fault, not mine.
6752160	6754160	That's how he ended up on TBS.
6757160	6758160	Yeah, so you're inside of him.
6758160	6759160	Did you want to do anything else?
6759160	6761160	Yeah, I want to look around.
6761160	6762160	Do an attack.
6762160	6764160	You have attack damage.
6764160	6765160	Shit.
6765160	6766160	What do I see in there?
6766160	6768160	Am I gaseous or can I see?
6768160	6771160	You could, you're gaseous and you can see.
6771160	6772160	You see a bunch of.
6772160	6776160	Sharpie, expand yourself as much as you can.
6776160	6777160	Just let me see.
6777160	6778160	That's what she said.
6778160	6780160	What do I see?
6780160	6781160	Yeah, you see.
6781160	6782160	And how can I see?
6782160	6783160	I'm gaseous.
6783160	6784160	I don't have eyeballs.
6784160	6786160	It would take a lot longer than, yeah.
6786160	6791160	But you see a lot of stuff you don't understand because it's magical robot shit.
6791160	6793160	And you're not like a magical robotician.
6793160	6795160	But I know what a heart is.
6795160	6796160	You sure do.
6796160	6798160	I know where the power is coming from.
6798160	6801160	Well, you see a weird glowing thing.
6801160	6803160	You see a lot of weird glowing things.
6803160	6806160	But I see something glowing more than other things.
6806160	6807160	Nope.
6807160	6808160	They're all glowing equal.
6808160	6809160	No, I do.
6809160	6810160	They're different colors.
6810160	6812160	I see something red.
6813160	6814160	I see a red thing.
6814160	6815160	OK.
6815160	6819160	I see it glowing bright in the chest area.
6819160	6823160	And I gassed my way over to that.
6823160	6824160	OK.
6824160	6827160	Dan, you can't just tell him what's there.
6827160	6832160	I am having a moment here with Spencer.
6832160	6834160	That's where I go to that.
6834160	6836160	And then I reform around it.
6836160	6837160	OK.
6837160	6838160	Punching it.
6838160	6839160	Punching it.
6839160	6843160	I see a purse boutique.
6843160	6844160	Punching.
6844160	6845160	OK.
6845160	6846160	So you flow in.
6846160	6847160	You flow in.
6847160	6848160	And you stop.
6848160	6854160	You see what is a red glowing thing inside the interior of this machine.
6854160	6855160	You re-corpilize.
6855160	6856160	Yeah.
6856160	6858160	And you start punching it.
6858160	6866160	Well, I mean, if you want to get specific about what I'm doing, there's obviously cords,
6866160	6868160	wires, valves coming through it.
6868160	6869160	There's not.
6869160	6870160	There's a glowing red thing.
6870160	6871160	But that's it.
6871160	6872160	Oh, really?
6872160	6873160	Yeah.
6873160	6874160	OK.
6874160	6875160	Then, yes.
6875160	6876160	I mean, there's more glowing things.
6876160	6877160	There's no cords or wires.
6877160	6878160	All right.
6878160	6879160	Then I...
6879160	6880160	I mean, how long is this move?
6880160	6881160	Yes.
6881160	6883160	I re-corpilize and I punch it.
6883160	6884160	OK.
6884160	6885160	You start punching the red thing.
6885160	6887160	It continues to glow.
6887160	6888160	And it starts glowing brighter.
6888160	6890160	And it's getting hotter as you're punching it.
6890160	6892160	It's going to start burning you if you keep punching it.
6892160	6894160	I'm going to start burning it.
6894160	6895160	OK.
6895160	6897160	Well, then it continues to glow brighter and brighter and brighter.
6897160	6898160	So do I.
6898160	6899160	Oh, bullets.
6899160	6903160	I mean, let's put that aside for a moment.
6903160	6909160	It continues to glow brighter and then it emits.
6909160	6910160	Spencer!
6910160	6911160	Spencer!
6911160	6912160	Spencer!
6912160	6913160	Spencer!
6913160	6914160	Get back!
6914160	6915160	Spencer!
6915160	6916160	He left.
6916160	6919160	He left the job.
6919160	6920160	Spencer just walked...
6920160	6921160	Get it back here!
6921160	6922160	Spencer, we need you!
6922160	6924160	He just walked out the back.
6924160	6925160	Oh, my God.
6925160	6926160	What the fuck?
6926160	6929160	Dan fell asleep and started snoring.
6929160	6934160	I'll take over.
6934160	6935160	What just happened?
6935160	6936160	We lost...
6936160	6937160	We lost...
6937160	6938160	We lost...
6938160	6939160	We lost Spencer.
6939160	6940160	Spencer!
6940160	6941160	It's a cliffhanger.
6941160	6943160	I couldn't have been more invested in what was happening.
6943160	6944160	I know.
6944160	6947160	Like, he was experiencing a totally different thing.
6947160	6951160	I think he took the snoring thing as a comment on his dungeon restaurant.
6951160	6952160	Oh, like...
6952160	6953160	Yeah.
6953160	6955160	Way to go, Aaron.
6955160	6956160	What?
6956160	6957160	The...
6957160	6958160	All right.
6958160	6959160	So, Aaron McGathey is a bad person.
6959160	6960160	Cliffhanger!
6960160	6961160	Thank you for coming to Heart of a Town, everybody.
6961160	6962160	Can we give it up one more time for Spencer Crittenden, Aaron McGathey, Dr. Christopher Ryan,
6962160	6963160	and fucking Lorraine Newman, everybody.
6963160	6964160	Lorraine Newman!

6994160	6995160	Thank you.
6995160	6996160	Goodnight, all.
6996160	6997160	We made him leave.
