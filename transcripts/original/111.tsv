0	27520	Hello, one and all, from Hollywood, California, Meltdown Promise with Nerd Melt Theater.
27520	29960	Herman Town is now in second.
29960	41880	The vodka is on stage, the comptroller is at his desk, let's walk up the layer of Herman
41880	42880	Town.
42880	45880	Dan Harmon.
45880	56840	Wow, what a crowd.
56840	63520	I hope some of you got some of Erin McGathey's cupcakes on the way in.
63520	65200	Loaded with peyote.
65200	67760	Yep, sorry about that.
67760	72160	At the time, D&D starts, it's gonna get wild.
72160	78520	I had convinced Erin on the ride over here tonight, the topic of Kiss came up, the band
78520	85240	Kiss, because we drove past a billboard for some new reality show, and I had her convinced
85240	95880	for a few blocks that there was a fifth member of Kiss named Kissy Face, that there was Cat
95880	103460	Face and Demon Face and Star Face, but that there was a guy, the original member was Kissy
103460	107320	Face, and he was the drummer, and he had a big hat shaped like lips, and they kicked
107320	109800	him out of the band and shortened the name to Kiss.
109800	112920	And you had sold her on that?
112920	118840	She was googling like crazy, she was looking for pictures, I was like, keep looking, they
118840	120840	covered it up.
120840	124400	It's the story Kiss doesn't want you to know.
124400	128080	Are you talking about the same billboard I saw?
128080	132120	Yeah, it says from Arena Rock to Arena Football.
132120	138680	That's the reality show, there's an indoor football team called the Los Angeles Kiss,
138680	143920	that's an actual indoor football team that's called the Kiss, and that Kiss owns.
143920	144920	That's not a TV show.
144920	150040	Well, it is now, motherfucker, coming soon to AMC, and we just did their work for them.
150040	151040	For real?
151040	152040	Yeah, that's what it said, new series coming to AMC.
152040	155680	Oh, I saw that billboard, I thought it was an ad, like buy tickets now to go see the
155680	156680	Kiss.
156680	162120	Check it out, of all the shows we could promote with this show, let's go flock to AMC and
162120	164120	watch Kissy Football.
164120	174640	It's called 4th and Rock, 4th and Loud, 4th and Loud, which doesn't rhyme or scam.
174640	177160	How about 3rd and Dumb?
177160	183880	Alright, you may notice, Jeff, that I have a new phone case here, it looks like a book,
183880	190000	and it also is a wallet, it's got my driver's license and credit cards in it, a little bit
190000	193800	of money, not a lot.
193800	196360	Does somebody in the audience guesses how much money do they get to keep the whole
196360	197360	thing?
197360	198360	No.
198360	205640	But it's, I don't have a wallet in my back pocket, I am wallet free for the last three
205640	210440	days, I'm doing an experiment, can I just have my phone case, I have no wallet in my
210440	211440	back pocket.
211440	215160	Alright, moving on.
215160	219560	My anxiety about that, I'm projecting my own anxiety onto that, you have your phone and
219560	224640	all of your essential identification, credit cards, money, all in one basket.
224640	228240	Yeah, but if you lose your phone, you've lost the whole shop.
228240	233880	Yeah, but I don't lose my phone, and especially now that it's my wallet, I definitely won't
233880	238720	because I'm constantly, the uncomfortable thing about it is that I've trained myself
238720	243160	because I used to lose my wallet constantly when I was in my 20s, and I just became, you
243160	246720	know, the third time you lose your wallet and you have to get a new driver's license
246720	250560	and all that shit, you get really conditioned to, you know, I'm constantly patting my ass
250560	255440	whenever I'm anywhere, like whenever I stand up, whenever I'm leaving a building, I just
255440	260520	give my ass a good pat, and then if there's nothing there, I panic, and then if it's in
260520	262280	my front pocket, oh god.
262280	267200	So now, I'm also tired of every time I sit down, I have to pull out a phone, I have to
267200	271040	pull out a wallet, I stack them up on the table, it's some weird distracting beginning
271040	276120	to every sit down with me, what's this guy like stacking all this shit on the table for,
276120	280560	what's his deal, what's he gonna put up there next, like a wrench or a shoe, who is he,
280560	284560	what kind of status play is this, now I just put down this little, this little book.
284560	289120	I like that it's a little leather bound edition, clothes, it looks like a little bible, so
289120	291880	you look like a kind of an old timey preacher.
291880	297680	Yeah, yeah, it's pretty nice, although I think I'm gonna go back to the eye harmon pretty
297680	301960	soon because I just realized something, you're not gonna stick with the eye harmon man.
301960	307760	I think I am now because I have to remember things and I think that whatever, the thing
307760	311840	that stops me from writing them down, I just realize this now, it has nothing to do with
311840	315640	the technology or how hard it is, and everything to do with the fact that it always feels weird
315640	320520	to pull out your phone and start it up, because that looks identical to not giving a shit
320520	324800	about what someone's saying, when in fact, like writing it down with a pencil and a piece
324800	330560	of paper, they'll be like, holy fuck, this guy's really listening to me.
331560	335960	Yeah, and it's like the opposite if you get your phone out, it looks like you're texting
335960	338200	people while they're talking.
338200	343800	So that concludes Boring Corner.
343800	344800	Shark Week.
344800	345800	Shark Week, Jeff.
345800	346800	Oh God, it started today.
346800	347800	Yeah.
347800	351640	Look, I didn't watch the last couple of Shark Weeks because I didn't like where Shark Week
351640	352640	was going.
352640	354600	I just read an article about this.
354600	355600	Oh yeah?
355600	356600	Yeah.
356640	361880	Yesterday, I went through the DirecTV, like DVR, like the guide kind of thing.
361880	369480	I said, let's see what 2014 new shark material is, and they got some doozies coming up.
369480	371920	Well, some of them are lies, Jeff, lies.
371920	373240	There's an article about it.
373240	374240	Shark lies?
374240	375240	In the blah, blah, blah, blah.com.
375240	379920	I didn't write down my sources, but I was reading an article on the way here, someone
379920	385080	who has outraged at how Shark Week's become about lies, lies, like fake sensationalized,
385080	387560	like fake documentaries masquerading as real ones.
387560	393160	Well, this one is called, like, there's something that sounds like a movie about a shark.
393160	394160	Like Megalodon.
394160	395160	Megalodon.
395160	396160	It's not Megalodon.
396160	397720	That's like a prehistoric shark.
397720	401160	Well, yeah, but they got one this Shark Week about Megalodon, and it's fake.
401160	402160	But that's all baloney.
402160	403160	Yeah.
403160	404160	Exactly.
404160	405160	And I read an article about it.
405160	406160	It's abalone.
406160	407160	It's average journalist.
407160	408160	It's abalone.
408160	410800	Shark Week is abalone.
410800	412800	And.
412800	413800	Dot funny.
414800	422760	And Discovery Canada aired a very controversial commercial featuring fake iPhone footage
422760	424760	of a shark in Lake Ontario.
424760	425760	What?
425760	429840	And they said, watch Shark Week, air in Canada, Discovery Canada.
429840	435000	And they aired this little iPhone video that they staged with a fake shark in Lake Ontario.
435000	438680	And it's just a bunch of guys going, hey, hey, man, can we catch a fish?
438680	440680	Yeah, man, let's catch a fish.
440680	442680	Whoa, look, a shark.
442680	444960	And it's like this shark comes up and.
444960	447560	Why are they all from California, though?
447560	454240	Yeah, I just think anyone that does anything physical sounds like this.
454240	457320	Have you seen the Rob Lowe commercial for it?
457320	459400	He goes, so sharky.
459400	460400	What?
460400	462400	Rob Lowe is like jet skiing?
462400	463400	What's he doing?
463400	465400	He's standing on sharks.
465400	471240	He's standing on sharks like water skis, kind of, and there's some bikini gals, and he goes,
471240	472240	so sharky.
472800	474800	No, I haven't seen that.
474800	476800	I don't understand this person's outrage.
476800	477800	I don't know.
477800	478800	I guess this brings up an interesting topic.
478800	485040	Like, is the media supposed to have integrity, or are people supposed to, hasn't that ship
485040	486040	sailed?
486040	488440	Isn't the ball in people's court now?
488440	490760	Aren't we supposed to have integrity now?
490760	493600	We have to realize that the media is full of shit and start acting accordingly.
493600	497160	Is that thing like on John Oliver's show, like Last Week Tonight or whatever, and he
497160	502680	talked about where they're making advertisement mimic news articles.
502680	507640	They look like news, and so it's the idea that we're making things look real, but it's
507640	508640	all just ads.
508640	514120	And the LA Times, years and years ago, started running things that looked like news at the
514120	518440	bottom like third of the front page, and it was all advertisement, and that caused a big
518440	519440	shitstorm.
519440	525360	But you shouldn't be able to, I mean, we've entered an age now where it should just be
525360	528800	up to people to know that everything they see and hear is fucking garbage bullshit.
528800	534440	I mean, we live on the inside of a goddamn honeycomb that we built, the people before
534440	537080	us that were raised on media that was full of horseshit, too.
537080	541240	Like, we're three layers deep in a fucking beehive of garbage.
541240	544000	There's nothing, nothing.
544000	545880	New York Times, fuck off.
545880	547680	There's nothing in there that's true.
547680	549000	Everything's the opposite of truth.
549000	553200	Like, anything that's not telling you that you live in a giant empire that's running
553200	557680	on the blood of the impoverished around the earth is a lie.
557680	562160	There's no sharks in Lake Ontario, and nothing else is true either.
562160	563680	No myths have been busted.
563680	565800	And by the way, I'm not complaining.
565800	566960	I love poor people's blood.
566960	570960	It powers my new car I'm gonna, I'm fucking, I love it.
570960	574040	I just think we should wear togas and commit to it.
574040	579520	Like, Rome, they didn't have media in Rome that was like, and people are like, that ad
579520	587400	for a cherry, it looks like a newspaper article, goo, goo, goo, goo, lies, lies.
587400	588400	How what am I to do?
588400	589400	No, no.
589400	592680	People, people get out there and gave speeches and they would, they would, or they would
592680	593680	lie that way.
593680	594680	And everyone knew they were lying.
594680	596640	And then every five years they'd kill him.
596640	599200	Oh, here comes the big liar.
599200	600200	Hey, liar.
600200	604480	It's too powerful to call out lying too loud because then he'll have us killed.
604480	607720	But pretty soon, let's rise up and kill him.
607720	608800	Everybody knew that everyone was lying.
608800	610080	The religion was a lie.
610080	611080	Everyone knew it.
611080	612080	They're like, what do you worship?
612080	613080	A cat?
613080	614080	God?
614080	617440	He meows and makes the moon to turn into the sun.
617440	619920	Do you worship and worship?
619920	621520	No, I just love the parties.
621520	626960	I love dressing like a cat on Saturday.
626960	631280	You know, it's just like this idea that anything that you hear from anyone else is anything
631280	636360	other than entertainment, edification, like sharing emotion, you know, like, like, what
636360	640680	are a bunch of thumb sucking babies come worrying about whether Shark Week has lost
640680	641680	its integrity.
641680	649440	What is it, Discovery Channel supposed to be the last bastion of fucking, well, that's
649440	650440	so sad.
650440	652600	Like, we all like Breaking Bad.
652600	656400	That's a network that used to be American movie classics.
656400	658040	Everybody headed for the hills at a certain point.
658040	660120	They're like, oh shit, internet, run.
660120	662400	Everyone changed the name of your network.
662400	665400	And just call it KY Jelly.
665920	677880	Don't forget that it used to be Kentucky yolk jelly, every network has like these letters
677880	680720	and then you go like, oh yeah, that was the Nashville network.
680720	681720	Yeah, I guess.
681720	683280	Now it's just fucking whatever, man.
683280	684280	Every man for itself.
684280	689920	The Learning Channel and the History Channel have become hilarious.
689920	693720	And then some of them try to like cling to some vestige of their old identity going like
693720	697680	the Learning Channel, because everything's learning.
697680	706760	Like they have these new slogans, like you're watching the Discovery Channel, sometimes
706760	711200	television is Discovery.
711200	715880	Right now you're learning that there's a Munster's rerun on it.
715880	717200	The History Channel.
717200	719240	You know what tomorrow's history is?
719240	720240	Whatever happened today?
720240	723400	You know what's happening today?
723400	726720	Ben Johnson's eating a sandwich.
726720	728280	Eric, tonight, tomorrow's history.
728280	729280	Yeah.
729280	730280	All right.
730280	733040	So anyways, I mean, let's not, please, it's a television.
733040	738120	If you ask a toaster, what's the most important thing in the world, it's going to tell you
738120	739120	bread.
739120	743320	And if you ask a toaster, it's opinion of bread, it's going to say, I don't think it's
743320	746120	toasted enough.
746120	748800	So let's look at the television as an appliance.
748800	750500	What do you think it's doing?
750500	752640	It's making you watch it.
752640	753940	Is your neighbor racist?
753940	755600	Is it dangerous to go outside?
755600	759480	Fuck yeah, says the television.
759480	762720	Does your racist neighbor have bread, says the toaster?
762720	764720	Bring it in here.
764720	769720	If you can't finish it, put it in me, says the refrigerator.
769720	772600	But the fucking television is the worst of all.
772600	776520	It's telling you just whatever you do, stay in your living rooms and it will tell you
776520	778640	anything to make that happen.
778640	779640	Don't go to church.
779640	781020	Don't go skiing.
781020	786040	Does the toaster tell, when you're in bed at night, does the toaster tell the TV, when
786040	787540	they get up, tell them to buy more bread?
787540	788540	I don't know.
788540	789540	I don't know.
789540	796180	There's nothing about bread commercials on every channel.
796180	799300	The balance has been unbalanced, yeah.
799300	804700	I don't know, maybe there's like fun musical numbers like Beauty and the Beast.
804700	806200	I met Werner Herzog.
806200	808140	I saw the photo of that, it's amazing.
808140	810700	Yeah, that was after a 15 minute chat about movies.
811380	813420	He came in and did a voice for Rick and Wernie.
813420	817500	Well, okay, I have Werner Herzog questions.
817500	819900	Did he disappoint or did he satisfy?
819900	827020	I've never met a famous person that was more just exactly what you'd expect, which is not
827020	830060	to say that he's predictable at all because what you expect with Werner Herzog is that
830060	833660	he's going to come in and be Werner Herzog.
833660	835700	So he came in and he said, thank you for coming.
835700	836700	Oh, thank you.
836700	840300	I found a parking outside, it would be dead.
840900	842660	The vines that you're supposed to park in, I find totalitarian.
842660	848140	He's coming in to do the voice of a cartoon alien.
848140	849660	The character's name is Old Reptile.
849660	855500	So he's like, this character, is he a crocodile?
860300	861300	Snake.
861300	864340	He's an old reptile, he's an alien.
864340	867380	Do you have some form of...
867380	871060	I can't make him sound like Peter Lorre.
871060	873060	You're a little Michael Madsen there, too.
873060	881140	Do you have a fucking ear I could cut off?
881140	882140	He wanted to see something.
882140	884260	Well, this character hasn't been drawn yet.
884260	885820	So there's no concept art.
885820	889540	So we showed him a little bit of Rick and Wernie, I showed him a scene from the pilot
889540	891660	when they're in the intergalactic custom.
891660	897060	So he watches it for a second and he goes, ah, yes, I see, yes, they are creatures, but
897060	899100	they speak normally.
899100	904580	Wait, okay, second Werner Herzog question.
904580	910340	Is Werner Herzog now going, is he going to be on like Bob's Burgers or stuff, too?
910340	911340	I hope not.
911340	913220	Is he out doing cartoon voices?
913220	916940	How did you pull this?
916940	920180	We just sent to the casting department, well, he'd do it, and he's in L.A. and they were
920180	926580	like, yeah, he'll do it, but he, you know, well, I don't want to, yeah, he just did it
926580	927580	for scale.
927580	931020	And so you got Werner Herzog in the booth, and he's got the headphones on.
931020	932020	Yeah.
932020	933020	And who's directing him?
933020	934020	I'm directing him.
934020	935020	And Justin's there probably?
935020	939820	Well, he had a lot of questions about, like, he was like, so do you want me to do, uh,
939820	944180	exaggerated, uh, why am I, I can't, I can't do, I was, I was, I was doing this impression
944180	945180	for a while.
945180	946180	Just go more German, like Beast Morister.
946180	953460	I, I can't, uh, I think, uh, we have ways of making you talk, uh,
953460	955500	That's just a phrase I used to get into my German character.
955500	957060	I'm sorry to our German listeners.
957060	960900	It's a little Don Corleone right now.
960900	971860	It's a day of my Fuhrer's wedding, you come to me, uh, all right, so anyways, maybe, he's
971860	972860	in the booth.
972860	977020	I mean, first, first he had, first he had to understand, he was like, do you want me
977020	980820	to do a, uh, exaggerated version of, of, of myself?
980820	983980	I said, no, no, no, no, don't do just, just be yourself.
983980	991420	And he's like, oh, well, uh, you know, uh, myself is, uh, you know, uh, that's, uh,
991420	992940	this is an artificial construct.
992940	997020	And I said, well, the guy that you are, you know, the guy that you are, you know, having
997020	1000940	grown up, watched your movies, like, like, like that, that, that guy, and he's like,
1000940	1008140	Oh, well see that guy, you know, that is, uh, I am being, uh, uh, an exaggerated version
1008140	1009140	of myself.
1009140	1011140	I said, I said, okay, yeah, exactly.
1011140	1013100	He's presentational in his movies.
1013100	1014740	He's being, he's performing for us.
1014740	1019820	He just means, he just means like, like anybody is like, like when you're talking into a microphone,
1019820	1022140	you fucking step on the gas a little bit.
1022140	1026060	So, so then he got in the booth or he watched the cartoon and he said, yeah, the creatures
1026060	1027340	are to speak normal.
1027340	1034060	And then he got in and then he does this monologue and it's about penises and, uh, and it's just
1034060	1035220	this big blog model.
1035220	1038740	Like, he'd already read the material before he got there.
1038740	1039740	Yeah.
1040380	1046820	I read, I read the screenplay and I think that, uh, I think that it's, uh, it is, it's
1046820	1047820	very funny.
1047820	1048820	Yeah.
1048820	1055060	Uh, I was like, yeah, you bet you bet your, so he went in there and then he fucking nailed
1055060	1056060	it like first take.
1056060	1057060	He just did it.
1057060	1061740	And cause he's playing an old reptile who, uh, who, uh, without spoiling the story, it's
1061740	1063420	just a, he's just a, it's a cameo.
1063420	1067900	He's just an old reptile alien who's explaining to the other aliens that he's spent a lot
1067900	1072700	of time on earth among the earthlings and, and noticed their relationship with their
1072700	1073700	penises.
1073700	1081260	So, so, and it's just a big monologue about this cosmic observer talking about how humans
1081260	1084860	feel about their penises.
1084860	1090020	It's funny when they're small, it's funny when they're big, it's, uh, I've been to
1090020	1095580	parties where men will take an object, hold it in front and say, Hey, I missed her so
1095580	1106260	and so dick, uh, was it Pringles by any chance, uh, so, uh, so he nails it.
1106260	1107260	And then we just did some of that.
1107260	1111100	Actually I was like, well, can you do it more intense and can you do it more tragic?
1111100	1112100	Can you do it more of the things?
1112100	1113100	And then he, it was fun.
1113100	1114100	It was a lot of fun.
1114100	1119140	Then he plopped down and talked about, I wanted to talk to you about the act of killing, uh,
1119140	1123500	because he executive produced that and, uh, or he explained how he discovered that movie
1123500	1127820	or how it was brought to him by Joshua Oppenheimer and, uh, and we talked about how amazing
1127820	1129580	that movie was for a while.
1129580	1133620	And it turns out he, for those of you who have seen it, like, uh, I won't spoil it
1133620	1136900	for those of you who haven't go find the act of killing and watch it.
1136900	1141620	It's, I've talked about it on this podcast, it's one of the most incredible documentaries
1141620	1146780	I've ever seen, uh, the ending of it will from particularly impacting to you.
1146780	1152420	And he told the story about how he was actually very key in the, the way that that ending
1152420	1154780	was edited or rather not edited.
1154780	1160180	He was the voice of, of trying to convince the filmmaker, uh, you can't, you have to
1160180	1164460	show all three minutes of this unedited at all.
1164460	1174300	And I said to him, if you do this, if you shoot this movie for seven years and then
1174300	1186140	edit the final three minutes in any way, you have spent your life in vain.
1186140	1189620	And I said, is that how you, is that also how you order breakfast?
1189620	1202140	If I do not get feta cheese in the scramble, if there aren't also bits of bacon, um, and
1202140	1203420	I was, I was amazed by his story.
1203420	1205940	I was like, wow, this guy's a real fucking like, he's a genius.
1205940	1207700	Like that story proves it.
1207700	1209740	But then he said another story that kind of undercut it.
1209740	1211660	Cause I met, he said, who else has done the show?
1211660	1212660	And I said, Stephen Colbert.
1212660	1218260	And he said, um, I had a, an influence on Stephen Colbert.
1218260	1225500	Uh, I say that with humility, but he, um, I was doing his show and he came up to me
1225500	1227980	in the hallway before and I had not seen it.
1227980	1233780	I, I asked him, uh, uh, is it, is it Colbert or Colbert?
1233780	1238340	And he said, Oh, it's a, you know, it's the French it's Colbert.
1238340	1244380	And I said, you know, that being the case, you should think about changing the pronunciation
1244380	1249260	of, of reports and do the French of that, which is rapport.
1249260	1255940	And soon after that he started using that pronunciation of the, of the show and that's
1255940	1256940	adorable.
1256940	1261060	And he said, did you, were you, did you meet him on the daily show or did you, and he's
1261060	1262060	like, no, no, his show.
1262060	1264140	And I'm like, Oh, that's when he started pronouncing it.
1264140	1265140	Okay.
1265140	1269060	And then I just, and I just moved down and you can just picture where her attack going,
1269060	1270060	doing that.
1270060	1271060	And Stephen Colbert going, you know what?
1271060	1272060	I'm going to do that.
1272060	1280900	Like, you know exactly how that story unfolded, but an amazing guy and like really just like
1280900	1283740	kind of, yeah, when he enters the room, it's kind of, I don't know, you feel it.
1283740	1284740	What archetype is that?
1284740	1286420	He's like, he fills a niche for people.
1286420	1290380	And I think he's like, I think sometimes in his documentary is like grisly managed.
1290380	1294580	Sometimes he, he injects himself a little more than I think he might want to do something.
1294580	1298020	He makes himself more of a, like a protagonist in his documentary at some time where he's
1298020	1299740	like, what's up with the grisly managed?
1299740	1304620	He's like, he's hearing the, uh, the, uh, was it the cell phone or the guy getting killed
1304620	1305620	by the bear?
1305620	1306620	And he's in front of the wife.
1306620	1308340	He's like, Oh, this is, this is the worst.
1308340	1309740	You should never listen to this.
1309740	1310980	Oh, yes.
1310980	1311980	Never listen to this.
1311980	1312980	Don't ever.
1312980	1315060	This is really bad stuff.
1315060	1316060	Don't, don't listen to this.
1316060	1317060	He does a lot of weird stuff.
1317060	1318740	That's why you're watching his movies.
1318740	1323500	You feel this, like, you feel like you're in the hands of some strange master, you know?
1323500	1324500	You know, it's great.
1324500	1326060	His movies might take some weird left turn.
1326060	1328780	Have you seen My Best Fiend by him and Kroskinski?
1328780	1329780	That's a doozy.
1329780	1330780	Yeah.
1330780	1331780	That's how I was introduced to him.
1331780	1332780	Actually.
1332780	1333780	That was one of Dino's favorite movies.
1333780	1334780	Yeah.
1334780	1335780	He showed that to me.
1335780	1336780	Uh, but yeah, what a gem.
1336780	1337780	I'd like him to, I'd like him to be new peer-sent community.
1338780	1339780	I think that would be good.
1339780	1340780	Oh, yeah.
1340780	1341780	Shit.
1341780	1342780	That's amazing.
1342780	1343780	Uh, yes.
1343780	1352780	This, this, the things you are talking about at the study room table is, I understand
1352780	1364780	the concepts, but the real question is, at what price?
1364780	1369780	And if you change the letters in price, you get pierce.
1369780	1373780	Uh, I'm getting, uh, I'm getting a new car.
1373780	1375780	I want, I want, I want to, yeah, I know.
1375780	1376780	It's a three cheers.
1376780	1377780	I know.
1377780	1379340	I said it that way.
1379340	1380340	You reacted that way.
1380340	1382500	It's just the one that runs on human blood?
1382500	1383500	Yeah.
1383500	1384500	It's just, yes.
1384500	1389780	It, it has a, it has a straw that goes from it to the third world.
1389780	1392780	It's a new, like, super stretchy straw.
1392780	1398180	So, I remember when you were driving in LA, the straw reaches over to, uh, the Gaza Strip
1398180	1405780	and it just, it just sucks up too late.
1405780	1412780	Uh, you didn't care 40 years ago.
1412780	1416780	Their parents weren't alive 40 years ago.
1416780	1421780	I, I don't know why I'm trying to high road you.
1421780	1423780	I pay my taxes like everyone else.
1423780	1427780	Um, the, uh, but anyways, yeah, I'm getting, uh, I need to get a new car.
1427780	1429780	So, I came home last night.
1429780	1430780	You get that Tesla?
1430780	1431780	We were hanging out.
1431780	1432780	Nah, I decided against the Tesla.
1432780	1435780	It's too, it's out of my, it's, it's not for me.
1435780	1440780	It's for guys that are like, you know, like super, like, like, you know, like Rockefeller,
1440780	1443780	like, you know, I'm not ready yet for the Tesla.
1443780	1445780	Wayne Brady has a Tesla.
1445780	1446780	He's not Rockefeller.
1446780	1448780	Wayne Brady is more Rockefeller than I am.
1448780	1449780	Wayne Brady can have a Tesla.
1449780	1453780	You shouldn't have a Tesla until you have more than one car.
1453780	1454780	That's what it is.
1454780	1457780	You should have one of those special garages like in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
1457780	1460780	Like, like, like a car garage.
1460780	1463780	Like a, like a, like a, like where...
1463780	1464780	You mean a garage?
1464780	1465780	A garage.
1465780	1470780	No, as, as opposed to the Black Widow toilet storage that I have.
1470780	1474780	You know, I have like six toilets and a bunch of McDonald's cups.
1474780	1475780	Why do you have six toilets?
1475780	1476780	I'll tell you.
1476780	1478780	I'm glad you asked.
1479780	1482780	Because there was some...
1482780	1484780	Maybe I'm getting myself in trouble by saying this.
1484780	1486780	Is that an exaggeration first off?
1486780	1488780	I think it's like five toilets or something.
1488780	1491780	Just five toilets looming about in your car garage.
1491780	1493780	There's three bathrooms in my house.
1493780	1495780	So why would there be more than three toilets?
1495780	1496780	Maybe it's three.
1496780	1497780	It just looks like five.
1497780	1498780	Oh, you know what it is?
1498780	1501780	I bet it's like the tank comes in one box or something.
1501780	1502780	I don't know.
1502780	1503780	It's a bunch of boxes.
1503780	1504780	They're in boxes.
1504780	1506780	It's not just loose toilets.
1506780	1507780	No, they're brand new.
1507780	1510780	It doesn't look like a public restroom in there.
1510780	1513780	When I bought my home, the realtor explained to me.
1513780	1517780	I don't know if we're all going to end up in jail for me saying this.
1517780	1519780	The realtor told me there is a...
1519780	1524780	In the 70s, there was this law passed that said like anyone that bought a new,
1524780	1528780	bought a home new, had to change the toilets out to these low flush toilets
1528780	1532780	because there was this big drought in the 70s and there was this rule passed.
1532780	1535780	And it's, you know, you're only required to buy the toilets.
1535780	1536780	That's all they're going to check on.
1536780	1538780	So I'll just have them put them in the garage.
1538780	1541780	What?
1541780	1542780	Why not install them?
1542780	1544780	Because they're low flush, Jeff.
1544780	1546780	I have giant turds.
1546780	1549780	I'm a 41-year-old behemoth.
1549780	1551780	I'm a human bear.
1551780	1553780	But low flush toilets still flush the big turds too.
1553780	1556780	They're just more modern.
1556780	1559780	So what's the low part that they're like groovy?
1559780	1564780	I think toilets early on were designed without water conservation in mind.
1564780	1566780	And so there was just needless water usage.
1566780	1567780	All right.
1567780	1569780	Well, I'll have a TaskRabbit come over.
1569780	1571780	You guys use TaskRabbit?
1571780	1575780	It's like the Uber of having people like do shit around your house.
1575780	1577780	You can just, Aaron uses it.
1577780	1579780	You can just call a TaskRabbit.
1579780	1582780	You've got boxes of toilets there just as a graft thing?
1582780	1583780	Like where you just try to...
1583780	1587780	It's like, yeah, it's kind of like, yeah, when Paulie took over the bar and Goodfellas.
1587780	1588780	Yeah.
1588780	1591780	It's like the toilets came in, they went out.
1591780	1592780	They're just toilets.
1592780	1593780	They're just sitting there.
1593780	1597780	They're brand new toilets if you want a toilet.
1597780	1598780	Now I feel guilty.
1598780	1599780	I'll have them installed.
1599780	1600780	Jesus Christ.
1600780	1605780	I thought when I heard low flush, I thought, oh, so less turds go down?
1605780	1608780	That doesn't seem very convenient.
1608780	1612780	So anyways, I don't want to get off a lot of tangents.
1612780	1615780	I'm getting a new car.
1615780	1616780	I need to get a new car.
1616780	1617780	And I want to be very careful about it.
1617780	1621780	I've never really bought a grown-up car before.
1622780	1623780	What are you getting, Dan?
1623780	1628780	I don't know, but I came home last night after we were at Little Tom's for a while.
1628780	1630780	And Erin didn't come out because she said she was working on something.
1630780	1631780	It turns out she was working on it.
1631780	1636780	She made a PowerPoint presentation for me to help me price cars and look at them.
1636780	1639780	It was a little presentation.
1639780	1644780	It was called Honk for Harmon.
1644780	1647780	And then it listed the criteria that I'd been talking about.
1648780	1653780	Turns out the thing that I'm interested in is called infotainment.
1653780	1655780	I didn't know there was a word for it.
1655780	1661780	I've heard of edutainment, and I like that just as little as infotainment.
1661780	1662780	Jesus Christ.
1662780	1664780	I thought they fixed the air conditioning in here.
1664780	1665780	All right.
1665780	1666780	Yeah, it's infotainment.
1666780	1667780	I don't know.
1667780	1669780	There's all this shit that you want to know about a car.
1669780	1672780	But then I'm like, what about the screen and the thing and the doodads?
1672780	1674780	Yeah, you want the interactivity of the thing.
1674780	1675780	Get a Tesla.
1675780	1676780	They got that giant.
1676780	1678780	There's like five iPods in their iPads.
1678780	1681780	The Tesla is $60,000 to $100,000.
1681780	1684780	It's like two.
1684780	1685780	You can't lease one.
1685780	1686780	You can't.
1686780	1688780	You got that Yahoo money now.
1688780	1690780	I'm spending that on the wedding.
1690780	1695780	And also, we're going to do crazy shit with harmontown.com.
1695780	1698780	I'm already spending too much money.
1698780	1701780	But I'm going to get a really nice grown-up car.
1701780	1705780	What's the front-runners right now for you in the PowerPoint presentation?
1705780	1711780	Well, I thought I'd share this on the podcast in case any of you car companies out there wanted to...
1711780	1718780	I was thinking maybe a BMW, an Infiniti, a Mercedes, if you're listening out there.
1718780	1722780	You know, I'm still looking around.
1722780	1724780	Give me a call.
1724780	1728780	I mean, I'll only be doing this podcast for all these...
1728780	1730780	Why don't we advertise in the show?
1730780	1732780	Do we decide not to?
1732780	1734780	We're waiting for the big fucking haul.
1734780	1737780	We're not going for that short chump change, short con fucking...
1737780	1739780	Because I was talking to Wade Randolph today,
1739780	1741780	and he and Willie Roberts have a show.
1741780	1742780	What's it called?
1742780	1744780	Like real-life sci-fi or something like that?
1744780	1745780	And they're already advertising.
1745780	1747780	They already have revenue.
1747780	1748780	They're already pulling it in.
1748780	1749780	Yeah, but how much?
1749780	1750780	I don't know.
1750780	1751780	I didn't ask.
1751780	1752780	I mean, it's like...
1752780	1755780	We've been courting Nike for 30 years now.
1755780	1760780	It's beer money if you're down there, you know, smaller audience or whatever.
1760780	1764780	Like if you're not like some kind of big giant thing that people are flocking to
1764780	1766780	to hear all their news or something, you can't really...
1766780	1767780	It's kind of like...
1767780	1769780	It'll sustain you, I think.
1769780	1770780	I would like that...
1770780	1772780	When our podcasts start and I go...
1772780	1773780	Feral audio.
1773780	1774780	And then my music plays.
1774780	1775780	But right before that...
1775780	1778780	Tonight's Harmontown brought to you by BMW.
1778780	1780780	The ultimate driving machine.
1780780	1782780	Yeah.
1782780	1784780	But they'll just get me like...
1784780	1790780	I'll just be saying, holy shit, Jeff, I got the BMW SX7599 series.
1790780	1791780	It's so great.
1791780	1792780	I feel...
1792780	1794780	I'm such a happier person because of it.
1794780	1795780	You know?
1795780	1797780	I'll be saying stuff like that when I get my new car.
1797780	1798780	That goes against everything you believe in.
1798780	1799780	I'll be doing it.
1799780	1800780	I'll be doing it out of honor.
1800780	1802780	I'll be saying it for real.
1802780	1805780	Like the way I say I love Minecraft.
1805780	1807780	Why aren't they paying you?
1807780	1809780	They don't need the money and they don't need to advertise.
1809780	1813780	It's like the best thing in the world.
1813780	1814780	I made a...
1814780	1815780	I made a...
1815780	1816780	I made a...
1816780	1819780	Like a refinery in Minecraft.
1819780	1825780	I had this pipe coming up because I play this like tech world 2 modded out thing.
1825780	1827780	Spencer set up a server for it.
1827780	1832780	And so I made a glass dome and I have these little robots mine for me.
1832780	1836780	Because who the fuck wants the mine in Minecraft?
1836780	1838780	And then they put everything in a chest.
1838780	1842780	And then pumps deliver the ore and everything through these pipes.
1842780	1846780	Goes under my glass dome up through the ground in the center of the dome.
1846780	1850780	And into a series of pumps that go out four ways.
1850780	1854780	Separates the cobblestone, the dirt, the sand, and the gravel.
1854780	1857780	And puts them into assembly lines that compress them for easier storage.
1857780	1859780	And I was so proud of myself.
1859780	1863780	And I had a jet pack that I made.
1863780	1865780	And I soared up above the dome to look at my...
1865780	1868780	We're making podcast history right now.
1868780	1871780	I soared up above my dome to look at my new refinery.
1871780	1874780	Wait, you can soar above like an omnipotent force?
1874780	1876780	Yeah, with a jet pack.
1876780	1883780	And I soared up above it and it looked exactly like a swastika.
1883780	1887780	Because it's like stemming out and then it goes right angles.
1887780	1893780	And I was like, oh shit, do I change it?
1893780	1897780	And I showed it to Erin and she's like, yeah, that really looks like a swastika.
1897780	1902780	And I said, yeah, and it looks like a swastika for the worst reason.
1902780	1905780	Efficiencies.
1905780	1909780	It would be one thing if I was just some punk kid.
1909780	1918780	But it was like, yeah, no, I made this thing that sorts things and processes them.
1918780	1927780	It was an accidental byproduct that it's like, look down and there's Hitler giving me the thumbs up.
1927780	1929780	You're doing great.
1929780	1933780	Good job, Mr. Cobblestone Dominator.
1933780	1937780	I just started playing, well, not too long ago, playing Clash of Clans.
1937780	1941780	And every 100th base you go see looks like a swastika.
1941780	1943780	And sometimes I think it's accidental.
1944780	1949780	Some are just geometric shapes that look like they have little swirly right angles.
1949780	1953780	And they are either backwards or proper swastikas.
1953780	1960780	And some are like, OK, his name also has like umlauts in it and shit.
1960780	1964780	So that's how they're trying to make a comeback?
1964780	1967780	The Clash of Clans?
1967780	1973780	When I was a kid, this might be bullshit, but I remember being a little kid on Main Street in Disneyland.
1973780	1976780	And when you walked on Main Street, there's curtains.
1976780	1984780	And supposedly, and maybe it was imprinted on my mind, but there were curtains that had little swastikas on them on Main Street.
1984780	1988780	But that's also like an old timey, you know, like an old, you know.
1988780	1992780	An old timey Nazi.
1992780	1995780	That symbol predates Nazism by, you know.
1995780	1998780	But I don't think that there were like Incan Indians or whoever used it.
1998780	2001780	But like that symbol predates Nazism.
2001780	2004780	It's an American, Native American.
2004780	2008780	Yeah, it's for, yeah, it's like my friend.
2008780	2010780	Yeah, but he's saying it.
2010780	2013780	Well, Disney wasn't really into India.
2015780	2018780	Anyways, Jesus Christ, are you dying?
2018780	2020780	I'm cool to trot over here.
2020780	2021780	Really?
2021780	2023780	Maybe I just keep you fat.
2023780	2024780	It's cheat day.
2024780	2026780	It's cheat day. I'm probably sweating a cupcake.
2026780	2031780	You're sweating like, you look like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter right now.
2031780	2034780	It's a Chris Rock joke.
2035780	2039780	I thought that was a Dallas reference.
2039780	2042780	You're so old.
2042780	2046780	I don't even know what we're talking about.
2046780	2050780	Patrick Ewing wasn't even an oil tycoon.
2051780	2053780	Why are you sweating so much?
2053780	2056780	I see people fanning.
2056780	2062780	Yeah, I'm like a freshly served Big Mac here.
2062780	2065780	I should have said McRibb. That would have been funnier.
2065780	2069780	Stay tuned after the show for Harmontown After Hours,
2069780	2075780	where I do a little punch-up on my, on all the things I say.
2075780	2081780	Why don't we bring out Aaron McGoffee?
2094780	2097780	You look very pretty, and you're very jolly, and you're dancing,
2097780	2101780	but in five minutes you're going to look like this.
2101780	2103780	You have a lot of layers on right now.
2103780	2105780	I feel like a fucking rosemary potato.
2105780	2108780	You're dressed for like a brisk spring day.
2108780	2112780	Yeah, I know I've gained some weight recently,
2112780	2118780	and I'm doing a, it's an illusion. I'm a body magician.
2118780	2126780	The layers make you think, oh, she's so thin that she has to heat up.
2126780	2129780	It's called a Mary Kate diet, is what I'm doing.
2129780	2130780	She's chilled to the bone.
2130780	2132780	I feel very comfortable, though.
2132780	2134780	I did too when I first came up here.
2134780	2139780	It's heat, you know, it takes a while. It takes a second.
2139780	2144780	I will tell you during this pause that after the show tonight,
2144780	2148780	our producer Dustin Marshall's lovely girlfriend Elizabeth Messick
2148780	2155780	is doing a little gig, a little half-hour spot with her band
2155780	2156780	over at Harvard and Stone.
2156780	2157780	Golden afternoon.
2157780	2158780	Harvard and Stone, really?
2158780	2160780	Yeah, it's only a couple minutes from here, so.
2160780	2161780	It's a rock and roll thing.
2161780	2165780	I don't know if I will be going to the drawing room tonight after the show,
2165780	2168780	as we usually do, because I will be dead on the floor
2168780	2178780	like a recently recaptured Scientologist thrown into their detox chamber.
2178780	2182780	I'm sweating my life force out right now, so I probably won't be able to.
2182780	2184780	Do you have a bottle of water here?
2184780	2186780	I have God's water.
2187780	2190780	You're Bikram podcasting.
2190780	2191780	Yeah, there is.
2191780	2192780	Yeah, right, yeah.
2192780	2196780	Well, if we're going to call my bluff, I'll stop complaining.
2196780	2198780	I'm not going to hydrate.
2198780	2200780	I hate water.
2200780	2202780	I hate drinking water.
2202780	2203780	How's it going, sweetie?
2203780	2206780	What's it like to be engaged to me?
2206780	2208780	Do you like it?
2208780	2209780	Um, yeah.
2209780	2213780	While you hesitate, uh, no.
2214780	2219780	You mean like the period before getting married, like an engagement?
2219780	2220780	Yeah, it's great.
2220780	2222780	It's good.
2222780	2223780	Good.
2223780	2226780	Resounding hooray.
2226780	2232780	I mean, I feel spiritually like we got engaged much.
2232780	2238780	Oh, someone's very friend has visited.
2238780	2239780	We, I don't know.
2239780	2240780	Yeah, it's great.
2240780	2241780	I love it.
2241780	2242780	All right.
2243780	2245780	I don't have anything tonight.
2245780	2247780	Today was a really fun day.
2247780	2248780	Yeah.
2248780	2249780	It was kind of a perfect day.
2249780	2250780	What happened?
2250780	2252780	Take us through your day, Erin.
2252780	2255780	Well, um, we were up.
2255780	2259780	I forced you to play catchphrase last night, Jeff Davis.
2259780	2262780	Yeah, I was home at like 10 30 p.m.
2262780	2266780	And then went to your guy's place at midnight, I think.
2266780	2268780	And left there at 3 30.
2268780	2271780	We played catchphrase and we watched Who's Line.
2271780	2277780	And also we cried looking at YouTube about people loving animals.
2277780	2281780	It was just another night at Dan and Erin's.
2281780	2287780	I remember we were watching Dogs Decoded, a Nova episode about dogs.
2287780	2290780	About Russian ladies trying to make foxes angry and shit.
2290780	2291780	It was really ugly.
2291780	2292780	Yeah, it was upsetting.
2292780	2296780	Well, it was like, yeah, they were showing this Russian lady who was trying to figure
2296780	2303780	out if tameness in canines is genetic or if it's nurture.
2303780	2311780	And so she had all these foxes in cages and they were breeding one half of them for tameness,
2311780	2315780	taking the tamest one from each litter and breeding them and so on and so forth.
2315780	2318780	The others, they were taking the aggressive ones and doing the same thing.
2318780	2319780	So they had two collections of foxes.
2319780	2323780	And they were learning an incredibly important thing about genetics.
2323780	2327780	They weren't really trying to impress the dogs or anything.
2327780	2332780	But Erin just kept going like, why get those dogs out of the cage?
2332780	2334780	You don't have to put dogs in cages.
2334780	2335780	They're foxes.
2335780	2337780	It's in Russia.
2337780	2339780	It's 1993.
2339780	2343780	I was about to say, I don't really remember the documentary.
2343780	2347780	Get that dog out of the cage.
2347780	2348780	Get it out.
2348780	2350780	It's a rape culture.
2350780	2353780	It's just a male gaze.
2353780	2357780	There's another Negroni.
2357780	2359780	Negroni is what I just said.
2359780	2371780	Yeah, so we were up, which is a cocktail made with vermouth, gin and campari.
2371780	2372780	So it turned out.
2372780	2374780	We played three person catchphrase.
2374780	2377780	What I'm leading to is that we woke up very hungover.
2377780	2380780	Also, when you left last night, Jeff, somehow you closed the gate.
2380780	2385780	So the gate came inside and was locked.
2385780	2392780	And our friends, Kimber and Dave, who were staying in our guest room, Dave had to teach a class this morning.
2392780	2393780	And he couldn't get out.
2393780	2395780	And he had to jump the fence.
2395780	2397780	I just closed it behind me.
2397780	2398780	Yeah, it's not your fault.
2398780	2399780	It's the shitty gate.
2399780	2400780	It's not your fault.
2400780	2403780	I found the word secret button to get out.
2403780	2405780	And I closed it behind me.
2405780	2406780	It's not your fault at all.
2406780	2408780	But because it's happened once before.
2408780	2411780	If it hadn't, then, whoof.
2411780	2415780	The gate, it closed so hard that our friend couldn't get out of the gate.
2415780	2421780	What we had to do is we had to take a credit card, actually used Dan's pot card.
2421780	2424780	So it was like, well, this is like, this could be fucked up, right?
2424780	2429780	Like, they're not going to be like, well, sir, your pot card's not pristine.
2429780	2433780	I don't think you're ready to handle this marijuana.
2433780	2437780	It's a prescription card for medicine I use for my anxiety.
2437780	2438780	Right.
2438780	2442780	So I think it being fucked up is more of a reason for you to get the medicine.
2442780	2443780	You're like, look what I did.
2443780	2444780	I was so anxious.
2444780	2449780	I tried to eat it.
2449780	2457780	But I got up at 11.30 because my friends couldn't leave the house and got them out.
2457780	2459780	And then I started.
2459780	2461780	I've been on a little baking kick.
2461780	2464780	So I was doing a, which, oh, which you guys.
2464780	2465780	Oh, you're welcome.
2465780	2472780	Someone pointed out earlier how dangerous it is to put runts on cupcakes.
2472780	2474780	Is everybody okay?
2474780	2475780	Runts?
2475780	2480780	Yeah, runts, you know, there's a banana and other colored balls.
2480780	2482780	And I think it's going to change.
2482780	2485780	The world's biggest, hardest sprinkles.
2485780	2488780	Yeah, they're dangerous because they're not meant to be like sprinkles.
2488780	2490780	Like if you were to just swallow it, maybe you could choke or break your teeth.
2490780	2493780	But it sounds like everybody's okay.
2493780	2494780	Okay.
2494780	2498780	Dead men tell no tales.
2498780	2500780	So we were hungover.
2500780	2501780	It was late morning.
2501780	2508780	It was just very fun because I was, I was baking and I was watching a family movie like I like to do.
2508780	2511780	I watched Monsters versus Aliens.
2511780	2512780	Very great.
2512780	2515780	Very body positive.
2515780	2517780	Made me feel really good.
2517780	2518780	Someone just said, what?
2518780	2519780	Watch it.
2520780	2521780	It's body positive.
2521780	2525780	You just have to understand that if you're a giant, you're a monster.
2525780	2528780	But then you're like, no, I want to be a monster.
2528780	2530780	I want to be a monster.
2530780	2533780	Seth Rogen laughs his laugh too many times.
2533780	2535780	Just see it.
2535780	2537780	Is that Amy Poehler in the lead role?
2537780	2539780	No, I think it's Reese.
2539780	2540780	Oh, okay.
2540780	2543780	Witherspoon.
2543780	2546780	That's a crazy name.
2546780	2549780	She should own a media conglomerate.
2549780	2550780	Yeah.
2550780	2551780	Yeah.
2551780	2552780	Like Sumner Redstone or.
2552780	2557780	Reese Witherspoon acquired Warner Cable today.
2557780	2558780	Yeah.
2558780	2562780	We've joked about how media conglomerate presidents always have like.
2562780	2563780	Warlock names.
2563780	2564780	Warlock names.
2564780	2565780	Yeah.
2565780	2567780	Sumner Redstone.
2567780	2568780	Jesus Christ.
2568780	2569780	Don't hurt me.
2569780	2572780	Don't hurt my village.
2572780	2576780	Blood River Knifetown.
2576780	2579780	Even Rupert Murdoch's getting a little Salem-y.
2579780	2582780	He's at the top of a coal tower for sure.
2582780	2583780	Who's the other one?
2583780	2586780	You don't write a script and the good guy's name is Rupert Murdoch.
2586780	2587780	Who's the other one?
2587780	2589780	There's another one like Sumner Redstone.
2589780	2591780	That one's the sexiest.
2591780	2592780	Yeah, there's another one.
2592780	2597780	There's a third one that's also like Witherspoon.
2597780	2599780	Well, that's a good system.
2599780	2601780	Witherspellcraft.
2601780	2602780	Witherspellcraft.
2602780	2605780	Smooth, smooth moon.
2605780	2606780	Oh, shit.
2606780	2607780	Sorry.
2607780	2608780	Hey, everybody.
2608780	2609780	Oh.
2609780	2610780	Sorry.
2610780	2612780	Why don't you let that be Spencer's theme and we'll bring him out.
2612780	2613780	Spencer C.
2613780	2614780	Spencer.
2614780	2625780	Good job, Spencer.
2625780	2627780	Spencer bounced to the stage like a gazelle.
2627780	2630780	It's a real obstacle course, but yeah.
2630780	2634780	It's like Patrick Ewing.
2634780	2637780	The president?
2637780	2644780	Spencer, take us through either a highlight or low light of your day today.
2644780	2645780	Of my day?
2645780	2646780	Yeah.
2646780	2647780	I don't know.
2647780	2649780	I hung out with Abed this morning.
2649780	2652780	Real Abed for you guys.
2652780	2653780	Highlight or low light?
2653780	2654780	That was a highlight.
2654780	2656780	He's a cool guy.
2656780	2658780	Sometimes he wakes up in the morning, so I text him.
2658780	2660780	I'm like, let's go to Porto's bakery.
2660780	2661780	And we do.
2661780	2662780	Oh, God.
2662780	2664780	Does he die other days?
2664780	2667780	Some days he doesn't wake up so early.
2667780	2668780	Oh, Aaron.
2668780	2669780	Aaron.
2669780	2673780	I was woken up by Aaron who clearly thought I might have been dead.
2673780	2674780	She woke me.
2674780	2675780	She was like, Dan.
2675780	2676780	And I was like, what?
2676780	2677780	What?
2677780	2678780	And she's like, oh.
2678780	2682780	He was very stale.
2682780	2684780	I'm just 41.
2684780	2685780	That's all.
2685780	2689780	We were talking about YouTube bits and Dan and Aaron's place.
2689780	2693780	And there's the thing with a guy reunites with the gorilla.
2693780	2695780	And there's this guy that gets the whale free.
2695780	2697780	And the whale starts breaching and putting on a display.
2697780	2698780	So we're all kind of tearing up.
2698780	2699780	Dan falls asleep because I'm leaving.
2699780	2700780	I'm going to bed.
2700780	2701780	And then we start playing catchphrase.
2701780	2706780	And at some point, Aaron says, I got to go to the bathroom.
2706780	2707780	All right.
2707780	2708780	OK.
2708780	2709780	And she just crawls.
2709780	2710780	Oh, no.
2710780	2712780	And it's not like the bathroom's right there.
2712780	2714780	She has to leave a room, leave another room,
2714780	2715780	and then go to a hallway.
2715780	2716780	Ooh.
2716780	2718780	She just crawled like a giant baby.
2718780	2719780	I mean.
2719780	2720780	It didn't bother to walk.
2720780	2723780	I was very drunk at last week's Hammer Town and spent a lot of this.
2723780	2724780	Hammer Town.
2724780	2730780	It's a podcast I knew after this one.
2730780	2735780	That was a freaky, soft, goddamn it.
2735780	2737780	Did I really say Hammer Town?
2737780	2738780	Did I say Hammer Town?
2738780	2739780	I said Hammer Town.
2739780	2740780	All right.
2740780	2742780	Stop.
2742780	2743780	Hammer Town.
2744780	2748780	I feel very ashamed of how wasted I was at last week's Hammer Town
2748780	2750780	because we had been drinking all day.
2750780	2753780	And then I do not remember crawling to the bathroom.
2753780	2754780	I was having a blast.
2754780	2756780	There was a lot of hollering in the last Hammer Town.
2756780	2757780	There was lots of yelling.
2757780	2758780	I got a little sloppy.
2758780	2759780	Yeah.
2759780	2761780	I think I was a little nervous, Dana Carvey.
2761780	2763780	And I maybe drank a little too much.
2763780	2767780	I was crying, Kelly.
2767780	2768780	Yeah.
2768780	2769780	It was a real mess.
2769780	2770780	Did you have lunch?
2770780	2772780	No.
2772780	2775780	If I don't have lunch, I will literally cry.
2775780	2776780	It's really embarrassing.
2776780	2778780	If you don't eat lunch, you'll just start crying?
2778780	2779780	Yeah.
2779780	2783780	I mean, obviously, I've never had this kind of burden.
2783780	2789780	But I'd imagine it's a tiny bit what it's like to get PMS.
2789780	2793780	Just in terms of I'll realize I'm crying.
2793780	2795780	And I'll be like, why am I crying?
2795780	2800780	Oh, because it's 3 o'clock and I haven't had any Chinese food.
2801780	2807780	I mean, it is a similar thing where people experience PMS in different ways.
2807780	2812780	But sometimes one will find themselves crying and be like, why am I such a...
2812780	2813780	Oh, it's this.
2813780	2814780	Yeah.
2814780	2815780	It's just something physiologically.
2815780	2816780	The surge is coming.
2816780	2820780	Spencer, next time you and I go for early morning Porto's Bakery, can I come along?
2820780	2821780	Sure.
2821780	2822780	Yeah.
2822780	2823780	Are you up in the morning?
2823780	2824780	Yeah.
2824780	2825780	Yeah.
2825780	2826780	Awesome.
2826780	2827780	Whoo!
2827780	2828780	I got some tweets.
2828780	2834780	I know we have some pilgrims that have come from far and away to see Harvingtown tonight.
2834780	2836780	I think there's someone from Belgium here, isn't there?
2836780	2837780	No.
2837780	2838780	Is it really?
2838780	2839780	Right over there.
2839780	2840780	I see it.
2840780	2841780	Wow.
2841780	2843780	Why did someone else clap over there?
2843780	2845780	Maybe they just love Belgium.
2845780	2848780	Belgium has the best Christmas rituals.
2848780	2850780	What's your name?
2850780	2851780	If you don't mind us asking.
2851780	2853780	Oh, where's the Belgian guy?
2853780	2854780	Yvod?
2854780	2855780	Levi.
2855780	2856780	Levi.
2856780	2857780	Oh, shit.
2857780	2858780	Yvod.
2858780	2860780	Man, that's foreign.
2860780	2863780	Levi, are you shy?
2863780	2867780	Do you want to come talk to us about Belgium at all?
2867780	2868780	Okay.
2868780	2869780	Levi.
2869780	2870780	That's Levi.
2877780	2883780	So it's a tiny country nestled in the highlands of the Belgium area.
2883780	2886780	Dan, before Levi can fill you in, what do you know about?
2886780	2889780	What do you honestly know about Belgium as a country?
2889780	2890780	Small?
2890780	2891780	Landlocked?
2891780	2892780	No.
2895780	2896780	All right.
2896780	2897780	That's it.
2897780	2899780	That's all it is.
2899780	2902780	Tell us anything, Levi.
2902780	2904780	What are you doing out here?
2904780	2905780	Business trip?
2905780	2906780	Pleasure trip?
2906780	2907780	A road trip.
2907780	2908780	Just a road trip?
2908780	2909780	Yeah.
2909780	2911780	Levi, you could have flown.
2911780	2918780	You just came out to North America to just drive around?
2918780	2919780	Yeah.
2919780	2920780	Oh.
2920780	2921780	Where else are you going?
2921780	2924780	You know, after I'm going to Joshua Tree Park.
2924780	2925780	Oh, cool.
2925780	2926780	Oh, yeah.
2926780	2928780	Are you going to do some of those drugs?
2928780	2930780	No, no, no.
2930780	2932780	I don't do drugs.
2932780	2933780	Ah.
2933780	2936780	Well, it won't be as fun as you think it will be.
2936780	2938780	It's a desert.
2938780	2940780	And it's kind of shitty.
2940780	2946780	People go because no one wants to be there.
2946780	2947780	It's gorgeous out there.
2947780	2948780	No, it is.
2948780	2949780	I actually love that.
2949780	2950780	I'm sorry.
2950780	2951780	It's great.
2951780	2952780	You'll love it.
2952780	2954780	But you really should do drugs.
2957780	2958780	He's going to do drugs.
2958780	2960780	His mom's listening now.
2960780	2961780	Okay.
2961780	2964780	Is this your first stop, California?
2964780	2967780	I went to San Francisco first.
2967780	2968780	Oh, nice.
2968780	2969780	We love San Francisco.
2969780	2970780	We do.
2970780	2971780	Yeah, me too.
2971780	2972780	Yeah.
2972780	2977780	What was your favorite part of San Francisco?
2977780	2982780	Well, not the hilly part.
2982780	2984780	I walked and...
2984780	2986780	Oh, you walked around.
2986780	2989780	Oh, is there a hill myth in Belgium?
2989780	2991780	It's pretty flat.
2991780	2993780	Oh, okay.
2993780	2995780	Not used to it.
2995780	2996780	What do you do in Belgium?
2996780	2997780	Are you a student?
2997780	2998780	You look kind of young.
2998780	2999780	I'm a baker.
2999780	3000780	A baker?
3000780	3001780	Oh!
3001780	3002780	Yes!
3002780	3003780	Yes!
3003780	3004780	Yes!
3004780	3005780	Yes!
3005780	3006780	What do you bake?
3006780	3007780	Really?
3007780	3008780	I mean, what do you...
3008780	3014780	I mean, for your life?
3014780	3015780	Yeah.
3015780	3016780	Yeah.
3016780	3017780	Do you wear a hat?
3017780	3019780	My hair just grew a little.
3019780	3020780	A hat.
3020780	3021780	Just a hair net?
3021780	3022780	Yeah.
3022780	3023780	Just wear one of those hats.
3023780	3024780	Yeah.
3024780	3028780	On school, we had some of those hats.
3028780	3032300	One of my favorite bakeries that I've ever been to is in Chicago, and it's Belgium.
3032300	3033300	And they're amazing.
3033300	3036380	It's like the best pastry is the best coffee.
3036380	3037380	It's really, really wonderful.
3037380	3038380	What's...
3038380	3039380	Oh, sorry.
3039380	3040380	You go.
3040380	3041860	No, I think we were going to ask the same question.
3041860	3044700	What's your favorite pastry?
3044700	3045700	That you make?
3045700	3046700	Like, what's...
3046700	3047700	Yeah.
3047700	3048700	Raspberry Baverwa?
3048700	3049700	What is Baverwa?
3049700	3057700	It's a sort of mousse with...
3057700	3059700	And a Lewis Carroll poem.
3059700	3067180	Beware the Baverwa, my friend, you'll gain 20 pounds.
3067180	3071140	Boy, oh boy, a baker from Belgium.
3071140	3072860	We're going to waste this opportunity.
3072860	3073860	I know.
3073860	3077540	What do you think of American cuisine?
3078540	3080540	I like it.
3080540	3083540	I like burgers, hot dogs, pizza.
3083540	3085540	Pizza.
3087540	3093540	What the podcast listeners don't know is that this guy is actually Werner Herzog.
3095540	3101540	Werner Herzog is on stage pretending to be a Belgian baker.
3101540	3104540	So you listen to the podcast in Belgium?
3104540	3105540	Yeah.
3105540	3106540	Why?
3107540	3108540	Why listen to it here?
3108540	3112540	It's very flattering that someone from a foreign country would be tuning in.
3112540	3117540	Well, I like communities, so I start listening to some podcasts with you.
3117540	3118540	I'm shocked.
3118540	3119540	Yeah, community's really important.
3119540	3123540	Like, just coming together as a group, understanding each other.
3123540	3126540	We have built a great community here.
3126540	3129540	It doesn't even mean that other thing anymore.
3131540	3134540	It's like how Cheers stop meaning anything.
3135540	3138540	I'm always astounded.
3138540	3143540	I always thought, and everybody always thought when we were making the show early on,
3143540	3148540	well, this is definitely not going to be internationally accessible.
3148540	3150540	But I don't know.
3150540	3151540	I guess it is.
3151540	3152540	I don't have a question for you.
3152540	3158540	I'm just so curious about a person born and raised in a foreign country,
3158540	3161540	like, seeing community and going like, ah, that's great.
3162540	3165540	I'm so astounded that that's possible.
3165540	3170540	I heard they love it in China from an admittedly Chinese person.
3172540	3173540	There's so many of them.
3173540	3175540	It's called communism.
3176540	3178540	Well, that's what I really chalked it up to.
3178540	3180540	They said people really like it in China.
3180540	3183540	It's subtitled, and it's on this website that's like Chinese Hulu.
3183540	3184540	That's nice.
3184540	3187540	I think we talked about this already, because I assumed when she said that,
3187540	3190540	I was like, oh, I bet it's because it's such a...
3190540	3193540	Yeah, it's about a collective.
3193540	3199540	Levi, what would you want Americans or whomever who's listening to this
3199540	3201540	to know about Belgian people?
3201540	3203540	And are you a...
3203540	3204540	This could sound like you're making a joke.
3204540	3206540	Are you a bell?
3206540	3208540	You're bell...
3208540	3210540	Someone said, oh, man.
3210540	3212540	But you just say Belgian.
3212540	3214540	You don't say Turk or...
3214540	3217540	It's just Belgian in English.
3217540	3219540	Balch in English.
3219540	3221540	Okay, well, what are the Flemish?
3221540	3223540	Tell me about the Flemish.
3224540	3227540	Something on the Flemish.
3227540	3232540	We are very, as a folk, not outgoing.
3232540	3234540	Are you Flemish?
3234540	3235540	Yeah, Flemish.
3235540	3236540	What is Flemish?
3236540	3238540	Is that part of being a Belgian or no?
3238540	3243540	Yeah, we have three parts of Belgian, technically.
3243540	3246540	Flanders, where we speak Flemish.
3250540	3252540	We'll be right back.
3254540	3256540	And we're back.
3256540	3259540	The new Infinity SX series.
3261540	3263540	Gold Bond powder.
3263540	3265540	So Flanders, they speak Flemish.
3265540	3268540	Yeah, at the time you have the French part,
3268540	3272540	but yeah, I don't really know what the English term for that is.
3274540	3277540	Whoa, your dad's here.
3279540	3281540	Can you say that again, sir?
3281540	3282540	Wankers.
3282540	3284540	Oh.
3284540	3286540	Wankers.
3286540	3290540	We have a guy from Suffolk back there.
3291540	3294540	A guy from a Guy Ritchie movie.
3294540	3296540	You fucking Belgian toilet.
3296540	3298540	I'll tell you what you call him.
3298540	3300540	You know you always fucking cunt.
3300540	3304540	Go back, make your Raspberry Hubba Goobies.
3305540	3309540	And wait till the Germans fucking invade you again, you twat.
3315540	3317540	You fucking toilet.
3319540	3322540	They don't call them Wankers.
3325540	3327540	Where are you from back there, fucking Southampton?
3327540	3328540	What is it?
3328540	3329540	Huh?
3329540	3330540	London.
3330540	3331540	London, really?
3331540	3334540	You're just a shadow monster from our vantage point.
3334540	3336540	Don't stab me later.
3337540	3343540	Wait, do people in London really feel competitive against people in Belgium?
3343540	3345540	No, I think it was reacting to the French, right?
3345540	3347540	The French part, what do they call them, right?
3347540	3352540	Is that just your innate hatred of the French or French adjacent?
3352540	3354540	No, I'm just very jealous.
3354540	3355540	Oh, yeah?
3355540	3356540	Oh, that's nice.
3356540	3358540	I'm all of Belgians, no.
3359540	3360540	What?
3360540	3361540	Wait, get up here.
3361540	3362540	Get up here, weirdo.
3362540	3363540	Get up here.
3363540	3365540	Shadow monster to the stage.
3365540	3367540	London calling.
3367540	3369540	London shadow monster, get up here.
3369540	3372540	I'm playing at the Scottish tune if you don't mind.
3372540	3374540	If you want to, of course, we don't enforce anything.
3374540	3376540	Oh, you're fucking coming up here, mate.
3376540	3378540	You're fucking coming up.
3379540	3381540	International Harmontown.
3381540	3382540	All right.
3383540	3384540	No, I'm not sure.
3384540	3385540	Sit down.
3385540	3387540	No, what's your name, asshole?
3389540	3390540	Pietro.
3390540	3392540	Why do you...
3392540	3393540	Have a seat, sir.
3393540	3394540	What's your name?
3394540	3396540	It's a term of endearment.
3396540	3397540	Pietro.
3397540	3399540	He's P-I-E-T-R-O.
3399540	3400540	It's Pietro.
3400540	3401540	Pietro.
3401540	3403540	Are you of Italian descent?
3403540	3406540	My parents are both Italian, but I was born in Canada,
3406540	3408540	then I lived in the UK for 10, 15 years.
3408540	3409540	This guy's fucking good.
3409540	3410540	Look at this guy.
3410540	3411540	You're like a model.
3411540	3413540	Are you like an international soccer star?
3413540	3415540	No, I heard you did some modeling, though.
3415540	3416540	As a kid?
3416540	3417540	Yeah.
3418540	3419540	I mean, better than me.
3419540	3420540	I don't know.
3420540	3421540	I don't shit at all.
3421540	3422540	My mother tells me I'm quite ugly.
3422540	3423540	Like, constantly.
3424540	3425540	Is that right?
3425540	3426540	Yeah.
3426540	3427540	No, she says, yeah.
3427540	3429540	I look like Ums Butzurro in Italian.
3429540	3430540	Butzurro?
3430540	3431540	Yeah.
3431540	3432540	Which means what?
3432540	3433540	Que coso de di?
3433540	3434540	She's like, yeah.
3434540	3435540	Just, you know, rough road.
3435540	3436540	Really?
3436540	3437540	Yeah.
3437540	3438540	Wow.
3438540	3439540	Is she here?
3439540	3440540	No.
3440540	3441540	No, no.
3441540	3442540	I ran away to America for a bit.
3442540	3445540	Well, this is cool.
3445540	3446540	Yeah.
3447540	3448540	It's nice to meet you.
3448540	3452540	Levi's like, can I please sit down now?
3452540	3456540	Do you have more questions about Belgium?
3456540	3458540	Why did you scream out wankers?
3458540	3460540	Which means masturbators.
3460540	3462540	Why did you scream out?
3462540	3464540	A wanker is somebody who masturbates
3464540	3465540	and doesn't know they're doing it, right?
3465540	3467540	I thought it just meant penis.
3467540	3468540	What?
3468540	3469540	What?
3469540	3470540	Or they know they're doing it.
3470540	3471540	I just mean like a wanker is somebody
3471540	3472540	who's just like an animal.
3472540	3473540	No, no.
3473540	3474540	It jerks up all the time.
3474540	3476540	Like dick, I guess, here.
3476540	3478540	No, I know it means like, yeah.
3478540	3479540	But I just mean.
3479540	3482540	I mean, I do masturbate, but I do know that one.
3482540	3483540	How frequently?
3483540	3484540	Oh, really depends.
3484540	3486540	I'm actually traveling with two guys over there,
3486540	3487540	so it's a bit awkward.
3487540	3490540	I said, how frequently do I do masturbate?
3493540	3494540	Try today.
3494540	3495540	I need to pull back.
3495540	3496540	No, no.
3496540	3499540	Like, you know, if I'm doing coursework,
3499540	3500540	then yeah, a lot.
3500540	3503540	I do a lot of programming when I graduated, so.
3503540	3505540	So wait, does that mean a lot of masturbation?
3505540	3506540	Are you kidding?
3506540	3508540	If you're programming for like 15 hours straight, you know.
3508540	3509540	No, I understand.
3509540	3510540	I'm sorry.
3510540	3511540	If you watch a few episodes of Community,
3511540	3513540	you see Alison Breen, you think, well.
3513540	3514540	Oh, OK.
3514540	3515540	Wow.
3515540	3517540	Let's bring on our next guest, Alison Breen.
3520540	3522540	Everybody get your dicks out.
3522540	3523540	Alison Breen.
3526540	3529540	Levi, who's your favorite community character?
3529540	3531540	Is that a dumb question?
3532540	3533540	Abbott.
3533540	3534540	Abbott.
3534540	3535540	Yeah.
3535540	3536540	It's sort of relatable.
3536540	3537540	Yeah, relatable.
3538540	3541540	You think you might be on the spectrum a little bit?
3542540	3546540	I mean, that's why, I mean, you're not half Arabic.
3548540	3550540	Who's actually played by a half Indian.
3551540	3553540	But yeah, you think maybe you're a little.
3553540	3555540	Yeah, a bit, I think.
3555540	3556540	Yeah.
3556540	3559540	Like on the playground, did anybody ever come up to you
3559540	3562540	and go, what are you doing?
3562540	3565540	And then you look down and like your pants are down.
3566540	3568540	Or you just have like a booger on your shirt.
3568540	3570540	Or like, are you just, I don't know,
3570540	3571540	you're just doing something wrong
3571540	3572540	and you didn't know it was wrong
3572540	3575540	until like everyone was in a circle around you going,
3575540	3577540	look, what are you doing?
3577540	3579540	You have a lot of memories like that.
3581540	3583540	Hypothetically, this is.
3583540	3585540	Don't stop, Dan.
3585540	3586540	Just go through.
3587540	3589540	They're going to have Sarah walk up.
3592540	3593540	So yeah.
3594540	3596540	You put that into your pastry?
3599540	3600540	Is your.
3600540	3603540	That's all a croissant is, is layers of pain.
3605540	3609540	Is cooking a way of, do you put emotions into your cooking?
3609540	3611540	Is there, are you connecting with people when you're cooking?
3611540	3613540	Do you think of it as a, or is it like a trade?
3613540	3616540	Did your dad hand it down to you?
3616540	3620540	No, I actually started doing it because I didn't sleep well.
3620540	3623540	So I decided to come and bake here.
3623540	3626540	So you started in your own kitchen and then you.
3627540	3628540	Not really.
3628540	3630540	I started going to school for it.
3631540	3633540	So you couldn't, you couldn't sleep.
3633540	3636540	So you got up and you enrolled in a school.
3640540	3642540	You probably baked a couple of things at home first.
3642540	3645540	You probably have to bring those into when you apply, right?
3646540	3648540	There's a muffin I made.
3649540	3650540	It's a crepe.
3650540	3652540	Got kind of cold on the way over.
3656540	3659540	You go to school when you're 12.
3659540	3662540	And then you have a trimester.
3662540	3667540	You can't die for Baker for with meat.
3667540	3668540	I don't know.
3669540	3670540	But sure.
3671540	3673540	And for a chef.
3673540	3678540	So in your, in your school system, you, it's more trade oriented, right?
3678540	3681540	Like it's not so much like funneling people into.
3681540	3683540	You have three courses.
3684540	3685540	Flanders.
3687540	3688540	And wankers.
3688540	3689540	And wankers.
3689540	3690540	Indian chief.
3692540	3693540	Candlestick makers.
3694540	3703540	You have a more traditional languages and stuff like that.
3703540	3706540	And the more practical like jobs like speakers.
3708540	3711540	Clothes makers and stuff like that.
3711540	3713540	And art school.
3713540	3714540	How's the unemployment there?
3714540	3716540	Is everybody have a job?
3716540	3717540	Most people.
3717540	3719540	Not many homeless people.
3720540	3721540	That's nice.
3721540	3722540	Pietro.
3725540	3727540	Pietro, you were talking about programming.
3727540	3728540	So you're a computer?
3728540	3730540	No, I did mechanical engineering.
3730540	3732540	I just graduated in July.
3732540	3733540	Congratulations.
3736540	3737540	Did you live here in LA, Pietro?
3737540	3738540	No.
3738540	3740540	Actually, I'm technically homeless.
3741540	3744540	We got kicked out of a hostel because we booked the wrong nights.
3744540	3746540	So we were actually sleeping.
3746540	3748540	So you're visiting from London.
3748540	3749540	Yeah, we drove.
3749540	3751540	So we basically went to San Francisco first.
3751540	3752540	And then we went to...
3753540	3754540	Like here.
3755540	3756540	I'm amazed we didn't meet.
3756540	3757540	Where did you think of the hills?
3757540	3758540	The hill.
3758540	3760540	I started in Bristol.
3760540	3761540	So I was used to hills.
3761540	3762540	It's very heavy.
3762540	3763540	Fucking Bristol.
3763540	3764540	Jesus Christ.
3764540	3765540	Fucking Bristol.
3765540	3766540	You know what they say about Bristol?
3766540	3767540	Full of cuts.
3769540	3774540	If you don't like walking on a level surface, wait five minutes.
3774540	3776540	It'll change.
3779540	3785540	That's the hilliest fucking burrow of the whole Queen's realm.
3785540	3786540	Yeah.
3788540	3791540	Is it Bristol cockney ramming slang for titties?
3791540	3794540	Bristol city titties, right?
3794540	3795540	It is.
3795540	3797540	It's cockney ramming slang for boobs.
3798540	3800540	I'm going to teach you something about London, my friend.
3800540	3801540	No, I get it.
3801540	3802540	You see if you're...
3802540	3804540	Oh, look at those bristles.
3804540	3805540	No.
3805540	3806540	You've never heard that before?
3806540	3807540	No, I haven't.
3807540	3810540	I think we're more reserved, though, than the US.
3810540	3812540	I learned this from a friend who's from London.
3812540	3813540	Really?
3813540	3814540	Yeah, it's cockney ramming slang.
3814540	3815540	Oh, Jeff.
3815540	3816540	I know.
3816540	3818540	I'm a privately educated guy.
3820540	3821540	I was joking.
3821540	3823540	World's fanciest homeless guy.
3829540	3834540	In your private education, did they teach you to scream wanker from the back?
3835540	3840540	Was that a day where you came to class with your little messenger bag?
3840540	3841540	I'm sorry.
3841540	3843540	My monocle has a chip on it.
3845540	3846540	That sounds like bullying.
3846540	3848540	He wasn't bragging.
3848540	3852540	He was saying, no, I've never heard that phrase.
3852540	3854540	He was saying he was private.
3854540	3855540	He was a fancy person.
3855540	3856540	He was explaining why.
3856540	3858540	He wasn't like...
3858540	3861540	He yelled wankers in the back of the room.
3861540	3863540	He said hooligan.
3864540	3867540	You guys said, aren't titties called bristles?
3867540	3869540	And he said, I don't think so.
3869540	3871540	And you're like, I think they're called titties, bristles.
3871540	3873540	And he's like, I'd never heard that.
3873540	3874540	But in London.
3874540	3876540	And he's like, well, I'm fucking posh.
3877540	3879540	But he's homeless.
3879540	3882540	But you have enough money to fly abroad and cruise about.
3882540	3883540	You graduated from a nice...
3883540	3885540	You got a nice degree, probably.
3885540	3886540	Yeah, no.
3886540	3887540	What university did you go to?
3887540	3888540	Oxford.
3888540	3889540	No, my friend did.
3889540	3890540	I went to Bristol.
3890540	3891540	There's another one?
3891540	3893540	Did you get double first to work there?
3894540	3895540	No, no, I didn't.
3895540	3897540	I partied way too much.
3897540	3899540	What did you read?
3899540	3900540	Mechanical engineering.
3900540	3901540	Really?
3901540	3905540	I did my main research, which is in ultrasonic fluid levitation.
3905540	3907540	So I levitated gin and...
3907540	3908540	Fluid levitation?
3908540	3910540	That sounds like code for wanking.
3912540	3914540	In a swimming pool.
3916540	3919540	Who levitated some fluids in the hot tub?
3922540	3923540	I'm studying.
3923540	3924540	Fancy talk.
3925540	3927540	Tell me what tits are called.
3928540	3930540	What is fluid levitation?
3931540	3933540	You just levitate particles of fluid.
3933540	3934540	You just keep going.
3934540	3935540	In the air.
3935540	3938540	So you create, set up a three-dimensional...
3938540	3940540	So magnetics are...
3940540	3941540	For what?
3941540	3942540	Magnetic fields or what?
3942540	3943540	No, no, no.
3943540	3945540	This is done entirely using air and vibrations.
3945540	3946540	Hello.
3946540	3947540	You just vibrate air.
3947540	3949540	Spencer, do you know about this?
3949540	3952540	Well, it sounds like, I mean, if you apply...
3952540	3955540	Is it like a certain frequency that's like...
3955540	3956540	Yeah.
3956540	3957540	So you set up a...
3957540	3959540	You call them acoustic horns or an longevity horn.
3959540	3961540	You put some piezoelectric elements behind it.
3961540	3963540	You apply an AC current to add it.
3963540	3966540	And then those vibrate because obviously piezoelectric elements change size of...
3966540	3967540	He knows.
3967540	3968540	He knows.
3969540	3973540	And then that sets up a standing wave, which then you have nodes where you can put droplets in.
3973540	3974540	Yeah.
3974540	3976540	Well, speaking of which, do you like end-ups?
3977540	3978540	Oh, I've heard of him.
3978540	3979540	No, not really.
3979540	3981540	I'm more of a dead-mouse fan.
3981540	3982540	Yeah.
3982540	3984540	How do you feel about the Chavs?
3984540	3985540	The Chavs.
3985540	3986540	What the hell are...
3986540	3987540	What's going on?
3987540	3988540	The Chavs.
3988540	3990540	There's a feedback loop happening right now.
3992540	3993540	I don't have an accent.
3993540	3995540	I'm about to levitate some fluids over here.
3995540	4001540	When Spencer said end-ups, I generally thought he was doing slang for the N-W-O-E-C-P.
4003540	4005540	I mean, they've really been slipping.
4005540	4006540	Yeah.
4006540	4008540	I saw a picture on the internet of some...
4008540	4010540	I'm sure this is not related at all.
4010540	4016540	I thought it was somewhere in Denmark or something where some scientist had created a cloud in the middle of a room.
4016540	4018540	It looked like a regular cloud.
4018540	4019540	Yeah, yeah.
4020540	4021540	I saw that.
4022540	4024540	So, was that you?
4025540	4028540	I was just wondering if that had to do with fluid levitation.
4028540	4030540	Yeah, it was my spare time.
4030540	4031540	That's interesting.
4031540	4032540	I mean, what do you...
4032540	4035540	Now that you have this very specific knowledge,
4035540	4038540	what kind of job are you looking to?
4039540	4042540	I actually already got a job with Toshiba in the UK.
4042540	4047540	So, I'll be doing research into futuristic city design, which sounds a bit weird.
4047540	4050540	Why is Toshiba going to be designing cities?
4052540	4056540	Toshiba has the wherewithal to design a city.
4056540	4057540	What do you know?
4057540	4058540	Yeah.
4059540	4061540	Old Detroit has a cancer.
4062540	4064540	Cancer is called crime.
4064540	4069540	Toshiba city will be enforced by a new kind of law enforcement.
4070540	4074540	Ladies and gentlemen, the fluid levitator 209.
4076540	4078540	Put your gloves down, wankers.
4081540	4085540	You have ten seconds before I come on you.
4087540	4088540	Dumb.
4088540	4089540	That is dumb.
4091540	4092540	Stupid.
4092540	4093540	More like five.
4095540	4098540	I think that we have a really good lineup for D&D tonight.
4098540	4099540	I feel like this is a...
4099540	4100540	I don't know if I...
4100540	4102540	Well, don't spring that on Spencer.
4102540	4104540	How many characters do you have?
4104540	4105540	Camille's not here.
4105540	4106540	Yeah.
4106540	4107540	So, I guess one, right?
4107540	4108540	Camille.
4109540	4111540	So, you're saying we have to choose between...
4111540	4112540	I'm not saying that.
4112540	4114540	I guess Jeff's saying that.
4114540	4115540	Right. That's the thing.
4115540	4118540	Levi, I have a question because you brought up the Danish.
4118540	4120540	Levi, why is a Danish called a Danish?
4121540	4123540	We don't call it that.
4123540	4124540	What do you call a Danish...
4124540	4125540	They call it that here.
4125540	4126540	A Belgian.
4126540	4127540	A Belgian.
4127540	4128540	The homeland.
4128540	4134540	We call it a butterkuchen, which is a bit better.
4134540	4135540	Butterkuchen.
4135540	4136540	Butterkuchen.
4136540	4137540	Butterkuchen.
4137540	4138540	Butterkuchen.
4138540	4139540	Like a butterkuchen.
4139540	4140540	Butterkuchen.
4140540	4141540	Butterkuchen.
4141540	4142540	Butterkuchen.
4142540	4145540	Yeah, a bit better because of all the layers of butter.
4145540	4148540	A croissant is also layers of butter, right?
4148540	4149540	A lot of patients have layers.
4149540	4152540	Yeah, but that's a sort of butterkuchen.
4152540	4154540	That's all from the same dough.
4154540	4155540	Yeah.
4155540	4160540	What kind of alternating current would you need to apply to layers of butter to make it...
4160540	4162540	There's got to be a reason why this is happening.
4162540	4165540	Can we make the world's best croissant here tonight?
4165540	4166540	It's like floating in the air.
4166540	4169540	It's just like croissant vapor that you walk into.
4169540	4174540	And you get a little bit of an electric shock, but you're like, whoa, butterkuchen.
4174540	4178540	First Pietro would have to overcome his abiding hatred of the Belgians.
4178540	4181540	I thought it was directed at the French, no?
4181540	4183540	I thought that was the joke.
4183540	4184540	I think it was just...
4184540	4185540	Yeah, sorry.
4185540	4187540	We never have any French people come to Harmotown.
4187540	4189540	They're afraid to speak up.
4189540	4191540	What other countries are here?
4191540	4192540	Oi?
4192540	4193540	Oi!
4194540	4195540	It's pronounced oui.
4195540	4196540	It's pronounced oui.
4196540	4205540	I thought I heard people wooing for Canada.
4205540	4208540	Are you guys visiting from Canada?
4208540	4209540	We live here now.
4209540	4210540	Oh, OK.
4210540	4211540	Oh, you guys...
4211540	4212540	Sorry.
4212540	4213540	You guys are so nice.
4213540	4214540	It's a melting pot.
4214540	4215540	You can't get out.
4215540	4217540	You don't get to retain any...
4217540	4222540	Levi, are you planning on going back home and spending your life in Belgium, or would
4222540	4224540	you like to live here maybe?
4224540	4227540	Jeff's looking for a roommate.
4227540	4229540	No, I'm going back home.
4229540	4230540	Sorry, Jeff.
4230540	4236540	What if he moved in with Jeff, or Jeff said that he moved in with him, but he was a prisoner
4236540	4237540	because of his...
4237540	4239540	Jeff just wanted his cooking?
4239540	4241540	I could absolutely.
4241540	4243540	And we would just come over and Levi would be like,
4243540	4244540	Hi, everybody.
4244540	4249540	And I had this scared look on his face, and Jeff was like, No, he likes it here.
4249540	4253540	Can't you imagine a world where Jeff's like, Yeah, Levi's moving in,
4253540	4256540	and you know, in Belgium, they do that.
4256540	4261540	Like, Jeff starts wearing different ties and is teaching us how to do Belgian cooking,
4261540	4263540	and he just can't stop talking about Belgium.
4263540	4269540	And also, you go to Belgium, and then they thank you for your innovations on there.
4269540	4270540	It's a nice world.
4270540	4271540	It's a compliment.
4271540	4272540	It's fun.
4275540	4277540	Pietro, you're going to go back to London?
4277540	4278540	You want to live in England most of your life?
4278540	4280540	Yeah, I think so, sorry.
4281540	4286540	When Toshiba makes Toshiba City, where is that city going to be?
4286540	4288540	What is it called currently?
4288540	4290540	I just have to wait and see, really.
4292540	4294540	Is it an idea?
4294540	4296540	They're really into...
4296540	4298540	I mean, I guess this is California, isn't it?
4298540	4301540	So they're really into, like, smart energy systems.
4301540	4304540	So let's say if it's really sunny in Los Angeles, but it's pouring,
4304540	4306540	it'll rain in San Francisco, and there's solar panels out there.
4306540	4309540	Could you divert energy efficiently to San Francisco?
4309540	4310540	Yeah, I think about that every day.
4310540	4313540	Toshiba's going to build a city that's going to steal weather?
4315540	4316540	That's what I heard.
4316540	4317540	What?
4317540	4318540	It's raining in San Francisco.
4318540	4320540	It should be over here.
4321540	4322540	The sun's out.
4322540	4325540	Our rain was stolen by a Japanese skyscraper.
4325540	4329540	Toshiba's like the villain from Rainbow Brite.
4331540	4333540	It's like Mr. Burns on the Simpsons.
4334540	4344540	Pietro, are you hard at work on the rain thief 2000?
4344540	4347540	I was trying to do a Mr. Burns, that didn't work out.
4347540	4349540	It sounded like you burned a hearse like.
4353540	4360540	I thought to myself as I watched the recent Harman town that things were decrepit.
4361540	4363540	Almost painful.
4364540	4365540	I don't know.
4366540	4367540	So what do we do?
4367540	4368540	We got an extra person up here.
4368540	4370540	Should Levi play a unicorn, or?
4370540	4372540	No, I should just go to night.
4372540	4374540	I feel like I really just interrupted.
4374540	4376540	Something rather beautiful here.
4376540	4378540	But the crowd's falling in love with you, Pietro.
4379540	4381540	He's bouncing the hearts and minds.
4381540	4385540	He's just doing that Downton Abbey, upper-class humility thing.
4386540	4388540	I've been given so much.
4389540	4392540	Pietro, Lady Mary, we would love you to stay.
4392540	4395540	I know you need it, Mary, when I do.
4395540	4397540	It's a private school.
4397540	4399540	I want to overstay my welcome.
4399540	4401540	This is your show.
4401540	4404540	No, you're both great.
4404540	4406540	It's an international Harman town.
4406540	4410540	We're going to find something for Levi to do in the middle of the game.
4410540	4414540	It's going to be an amazing non-player character that Spencer comes up with.
4415540	4418540	Maybe he can be your kind of laconic Avengers.
4420540	4421540	Oh, he can be Avenger.
4421540	4422540	Yeah.
4422540	4423540	I like that.
4423540	4424540	Nailed it.
4424540	4426540	Levi, are you familiar with Avengers?
4426540	4427540	Yeah.
4427540	4429540	All right, we're in.
4430540	4432540	Well, he gets out the character sheets.
4432540	4434540	So you're watching Community, which surprises me.
4434540	4437540	When people in non-English-speaking countries are watching Community and going,
4437540	4438540	I get it.
4438540	4441540	That's the funny joke about Pokémon.
4442540	4445540	Because that's American.
4448540	4450540	And so is Toshiba.
4451540	4454540	But then you're listening to Harman Town.
4454540	4456540	I mean, I guess I'm putting you on the spot.
4456540	4459540	I'm like some dumb person at a party going,
4459540	4461540	like, why do you like me?
4461540	4463540	I'm just wondering when you're listening to...
4463540	4465540	I know, it's because you're baking.
4465540	4469540	So you want to listen to just white noise.
4470540	4472540	No, it just...
4472540	4475540	It interests me.
4475540	4479540	Like, I also listen to the Nerdist Writers' Panel.
4479540	4482540	Like, all that stuff behind TV.
4482540	4483540	I like that.
4483540	4485540	You like pop culture and stuff.
4485540	4486540	Yeah.
4486540	4487540	Stuff like that.
4487540	4489540	What do you think about that actor?
4490540	4492540	That actor, Ben Acker.
4492540	4495540	Who do you like, better actor or blacker?
4495540	4498540	This guy doesn't even listen to the podcast.
4500540	4501540	Blacker, I guess.
4501540	4502540	Okay.
4502540	4503540	Blacker.
4503540	4505540	Because he's blacker.
4506540	4508540	Blacker's better.
4511540	4513540	Thank you guys for being here.
4513540	4514540	All right.
4514540	4517540	Can we hand out the character sheets?
4517540	4519540	You can do whatever you want, man.
4519540	4520540	Pass them down.
4520540	4521540	That's all.
4521540	4524540	So I guess, Pietro, you're going to play Christa Berg.
4524540	4525540	Are you familiar with this?
4525540	4527540	I heard one or two podcasts.
4527540	4528540	So you're a thief.
4528540	4529540	You're a rogue.
4529540	4530540	Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
4530540	4536540	You're a dashing British-Italian fluid-limitating rogue.
4536540	4541540	That's for Pietro, I think.
4543540	4545540	Wait, this must be Jeff's.
4545540	4547540	All the way down to Jeff.
4547540	4550540	And then Levi, you're just playing my hawk Avenger.
4550540	4551540	He doesn't have a sheet.
4551540	4553540	Spencer, you good to go?
4554540	4555540	Wait.
4555540	4556540	Oh, this is Aaron.
4556540	4557540	This is Aaron.
4557540	4558540	There we go.
4558540	4559540	Okay.
4559540	4560540	Yeah.
4560540	4561540	Yeah.
4561540	4562540	Yeah.
4562540	4563540	Yes.
4566540	4568540	Last time on Harmon Town.
4568540	4570540	Our gang was under attack.
4570540	4576540	After escaping a black dragon and narrowly dodging a crashing airship, our heroes headed
4576540	4582540	out of the purple canyons and found themselves on the road to Rosebook with a robot baby
4582540	4584540	named Laji.
4585540	4589540	Rosebook was a quaint little town at the outskirts of the purple mountains.
4589540	4595540	Less than a mile away, but as the gang drew closer, they saw horse-drawn carriage under
4595540	4597540	attack by orcish marauders.
4597540	4602540	The gang leapt into action, all except Sharpie, who was so busy masturbating that he didn't
4602540	4606540	even realize the deadly melee taking place all around him.
4606540	4607540	Sorry.
4608540	4614540	Our heroes struck, felling a third of the orcs in a single moment as Sharpie waded
4614540	4616540	into the fray, yelling and confused.
4616540	4622540	Moulraine, perhaps possessed by the spirit of Duncan Trussell, took her own life, stabbing
4622540	4627540	herself in the eyes and turning her brain matter into mush, killing her instantly.
4627540	4628540	Cut the music.
4628540	4629540	Cut it off.
4629540	4630540	Kill it.
4630540	4631540	Kill the music.
4631540	4632540	Like Moulraine.
4633540	4634540	All right.
4634540	4636540	So, yeah, that's what just happened.
4636540	4640540	You hear the beginning of a scream quickly cut short.
4640540	4646540	You turn to see Moulraine fall to the dirt, blood and brain spilling from her eye socket.
4646540	4650540	A nearby orc sees this happen and attempts to make it look like he did it.
4650540	4655540	He points at his head with both thumbs and goes, this orc.
4659540	4661540	No!
4661540	4662540	I react.
4664540	4665540	Is that the whole reaction?
4665540	4668540	Moulraine!
4668540	4669540	Is that his cum face?
4676540	4677540	It was a plot twist.
4678540	4680540	All of Dan's faces are his cum faces.
4681540	4683540	Think of that.
4684540	4687540	I'm usually listening to the podcast when I'm coming.
4690540	4691540	Is that orcish?
4691540	4693540	Are we still battling those orcs?
4693540	4694540	Oh, yeah, you're in the middle of a fight.
4694540	4696540	This happened in the middle of a combat.
4696540	4699540	So Moulraine is laying dead with a smushed brain.
4699540	4700540	And a sword in her face.
4700540	4701540	And a sword in her face.
4701540	4702540	Yep.
4702540	4703540	It's tragic.
4703540	4707540	I take her sword out to avenge her suicide.
4711540	4715540	I charge at the orc in a barbarian rage.
4715540	4717540	You charge at the orc?
4717540	4719540	Oh, you miss him though.
4719540	4723540	You charge at the orc, but maybe it's the sword that you've never used before.
4723540	4725540	It just is too heavy or something.
4725540	4727540	I run back and put it back in her face.
4730540	4734540	Avenger, attack the nearest orc with your bird claws.
4736540	4738540	After giving your mighty Belgian scream.
4740540	4741540	Whoo!
4749540	4751540	That's just how they sound over there.
4751540	4755540	Yeah, no, it's like different countries have different words for, yeah, you know.
4755540	4756540	Cock-a-doodle-doo.
4756540	4757540	Yeah, in Spanish.
4757540	4760540	Yeah, chickens go, kick-a-doodle-doo.
4764540	4767540	Avenger the hawk with his battle cry.
4767540	4771540	Scratches at the orc that Quark missed with his blade.
4771540	4774540	Clawing his eyes and dealing four damage.
4774540	4777540	York is running around screaming.
4778540	4782540	I, when it's, I'm gonna do shocking grasp on him if I can get to him.
4782540	4783540	On the same orc?
4783540	4784540	Yep.
4784540	4785540	Alright.
4785540	4788540	You try to do that, you miss also.
4789540	4794540	You lunge towards him with a shocking grasp, but he nimbly dodges out of the way.
4794540	4797540	Voila being the hawk.
4799540	4800540	Yeah.
4800540	4801540	Which turn is it?
4801540	4802540	Well, it's that orc's turn.
4802540	4804540	He's trying to.
4805540	4811540	He tries to dislodge the hawk from his face, but instead he just falls and impales himself
4811540	4814540	on Moraine's face sword.
4815540	4818540	I guess it's not an impalement, it's more of just a slice.
4818540	4820540	But, you know, he's dead.
4820540	4822540	He's dead.
4822540	4825540	They tried to get the hawk off when he killed himself.
4825540	4827540	Half the orcs are dead.
4827540	4829540	Nobody touched that sword.
4830540	4835540	The other orc, one of the other orcs runs away just because he realizes he's outnumbered.
4835540	4837540	And then, is that two left?
4837540	4838540	That's two left, I think.
4838540	4839540	Yeah, two left.
4839540	4841540	Two orcs left.
4841540	4845540	The other one just, he looks at the damage and he's kind of freaked out.
4845540	4847540	Is it Christopher's turn then, maybe?
4847540	4851540	It would be, yeah, Christopher's turn.
4851540	4854540	Yeah, so can I throw my poison dagger at the last orc?
4854540	4855540	One more?
4855540	4857540	I think I said two more, right?
4857540	4858540	Two more.
4858540	4869540	But yeah, you do that, you do that and you strike him right in the neck, dealing four damage.
4869540	4870540	Hock damage.
4870540	4871540	To his neck.
4871540	4872540	That's like a hawk knife.
4872540	4873540	Every little health.
4873540	4875540	Standard hawk damage.
4875540	4881540	He bleeds quite heavily and clutches at his throat, putting in a quirk's turn.
4881540	4887540	I take my mighty greatsword out and I aim right at his kneecaps and try to cleave his knees
4888540	4892540	I don't want him to die fast, I want him to bleed out.
4892540	4896540	You cleave at his knees and you slice them open.
4896540	4897540	Wait, what's your damage again?
4897540	4898540	I can never remember.
4898540	4904540	On the mighty greatsword is two d8 plus seven.
4904540	4908540	He explodes for the knees.
4908540	4911540	Jesus Christ.
4911540	4915540	His discs rupture.
4915540	4917540	Plus a million against orcs.
4917540	4921540	The last orc, the leader orc, he's wearing a helmet and holding a gold axe.
4921540	4922540	He grumbles.
4922540	4925540	He's like, I'm not gonna die today, you bastards.
4925540	4927540	He pulls out a necklace.
4927540	4929540	Oh, I have a ring down.
4929540	4931540	He pulls out a necklace from a pouch.
4931540	4938540	It's covered in three dangling glass baubles, each of which contains a blazing fiery nexus of light.
4938540	4944540	He takes three or four measured steps back and then hurls the necklace directly into the middle of all of you guys.
4945540	4947540	Oh, thank you.
4948540	4952540	It streaks like a bullet directly towards the horse-drawn carriage,
4952540	4956540	and for a split second all you can hear is the delicate shattering of glass.
4956540	4962540	But then a massive explosion rips forth decimating the carriage and creating a large mushroom cloud in its wake.
4962540	4967540	You can see that gnome that was earlier atop the carriage blasting off like a rocket.
4967540	4971540	He goes up at least 20 feet upwards before plummeting back into the earth,
4971540	4975540	landing on packed ground with a sickening snap.
4975540	4976540	He's still.
4976540	4980540	But the massive shockwave rips forth in all directions,
4980540	4984540	consuming all sorts of things in its blazing trail.
4984540	4986540	Make a reflex save.
4987540	4989540	What other are your reflex saves?
4989540	4994540	My reflex save is five.
4995540	4996540	I'm dead.
4996540	5000540	So infinite.
5000540	5003540	My dexterity is 14.
5003540	5006540	All right, well I rolled really high, so everybody saves.
5006540	5007540	I got five, sorry. I got five, yeah.
5007540	5009540	All right, you all save.
5009540	5012540	Everybody but Jeff takes 13 damage.
5013540	5018540	So his blazing fire consumes your bodies and lights things on fire.
5018540	5019540	Not your whole bodies, though.
5019540	5022540	Just 13 damage worth of your bodies.
5022540	5024540	But I rolled high.
5024540	5025540	I'm good?
5025540	5028540	Yeah, you're good because you got the dodgy.
5028540	5029540	All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5029540	5033540	Yeah, the whole carriage is consumed in a fiery blaze,
5033540	5035540	and then the orc, he clicks his heels together,
5035540	5039540	and little feathers pop out of his boots, and he flies away.
5039540	5040540	That hell kind of orc.
5040540	5044540	This isn't the last you've seen of Vathros the mighty...
5044540	5045540	Afros?
5045540	5047540	Vathros!
5049540	5052540	He disappears, leaving nothing but burning carnage.
5052540	5054540	Is that necklace still there, or was that consumed?
5054540	5056540	It's exploded.
5056540	5057540	Vathros.
5057540	5059540	I bet we're going to see that guy again.
5059540	5062540	I hope we do. I've got to escort us of him.
5062540	5068540	And make a note, that's how much three glass bulbs do on a necklace.
5068540	5072540	You know, if anybody ever throws down one of those things and it's got one on it,
5072540	5074540	you'll be like, all right.
5076540	5078540	No biggie.
5078540	5080540	It's like an M80.
5080540	5084540	I go up to the gnome that snapped on the packed earth,
5084540	5086540	and I examine his body.
5086540	5090540	He's pretty still, but his eyelids flicker open,
5090540	5094540	and he's like, oh, help me. I can't move.
5094540	5096540	Sharpie, heal this man.
5096540	5098540	I'm a wizard.
5098540	5100540	You have no heel spells?
5100540	5102540	Mm-mm, no.
5104540	5108540	No, that's not really a direction I went.
5111540	5114540	It chose to specialize in shrinking people.
5114540	5116540	Mulrain, do you have a heel spell on you?
5116540	5117540	Dead.
5117540	5118540	Dead.
5118540	5120540	Okay, I loot Mulrain.
5120540	5124540	Oh, I guess she got blown up.
5124540	5130540	Yeah, yeah, all the possessions anywhere in the fireball explosion are completely worthless.
5130540	5133540	So she's gone? She just vaporized?
5133540	5134540	I guess.
5134540	5135540	Really?
5135540	5137540	She was in the fireball, yeah, yeah.
5137540	5139540	I think that's how it works.
5139540	5142540	Don't you have some good berries or something for the...
5142540	5143540	I don't. That's a different game.
5143540	5146540	Oh, okay. Sorry.
5148540	5151540	Well, okay, I guess the dust is kind of settling right now.
5151540	5156540	I guess we could take stock of the fact that Mulrain, who we've grown to know and love,
5156540	5160540	she's been completely vaporized and gone.
5160540	5164540	I go to the dying guy, and I go, why were they attacking you?
5164540	5170540	I'm a brewer. They were trying to steal from my distillery. It blew up.
5170540	5172540	What, do you make potions or beer?
5172540	5175540	I make spirits.
5175540	5178540	Like beer spirits?
5178540	5181540	Yeah. Yeah.
5181540	5188540	A guy that can blow things up and fly with his boots wanted to steal beer?
5188540	5192540	If I had to guess, I don't think he knew my wares.
5192540	5196540	He probably thought he had potions or something.
5196540	5197540	Maybe.
5197540	5201540	I do my experiments out here to stay safe.
5201540	5203540	Beer experiments?
5203540	5208540	Yeah. It's pretty volatile. It's a moving still.
5208540	5210540	Right now it's blown up. It's gone, right?
5210540	5211540	It sure was.
5211540	5213540	Are you okay? How do you feel right now?
5213540	5215540	I can't move at all.
5215540	5218540	I attempt to just...
5218540	5221540	I massage him and try to heal him.
5221540	5222540	Okay.
5222540	5226540	You massage him, making sure to stimulate his fascial layers.
5226540	5230540	He doesn't seem to react because his neck looks broken.
5230540	5233540	I do have a brew potion.
5233540	5234540	Feet.
5234540	5240540	I don't know if I can look around. I also have knowledge of...
5240540	5241540	No, I don't.
5241540	5244540	Well, everything's all blown up. It's all...
5244540	5247540	I thought maybe I could see a piece of milk thistle.
5247540	5250540	It was a crazy magic fireball.
5251540	5252540	Yeah.
5252540	5254540	All right. Well, I think what's happened, sir,
5254540	5258540	is that your back and or neck may be broken.
5258540	5260540	You're going to have to hold still for a while,
5260540	5263540	and you don't have a choice.
5265540	5268540	How far away from the nearest city?
5268540	5270540	We're very close to my town rose book.
5270540	5271540	I should take me there.
5271540	5273540	I pick him up and throw him over my shoulders.
5273540	5276540	Hey, well, you're not supposed to move him.
5277540	5279540	I heard somewhere you're not supposed to.
5280540	5282540	That guy was cast, right?
5282540	5285540	What about my mage hand spell?
5285540	5287540	Can I use that to lift a dude?
5287540	5289540	No, he weighs more than five pounds.
5289540	5290540	And levitate?
5290540	5292540	Oh, you could levitate him, yeah.
5292540	5293540	Like all the way to town?
5293540	5294540	Sure.
5294540	5297540	I'm going to levitate you. I put him back down.
5300540	5305540	It's going to hurt a little, but not as much as that did, so...
5306540	5308540	I can't do anything.
5309540	5310540	Right.
5310540	5311540	We'll levitate you.
5311540	5313540	You lead the way to rose book.
5313540	5314540	You can see it from here.
5314540	5315540	Okay.
5316540	5320540	Hocus Pocus Body Flotus.
5321540	5323540	And as the body lifts into the air,
5323540	5326540	you begin to hear the loud rumbling of thunder
5326540	5328540	as the sky darkens above you.
5328540	5330540	Cacao, cacao, lightning.
5330540	5332540	Cacao, more lightning.
5332540	5334540	From the east, you can see a blazing white light
5334540	5336540	flying through the sky.
5336540	5338540	Quite far away, but you can see even from here
5338540	5341540	that it's aloft on great wings of flame.
5341540	5344540	Wings that shed flame onto the ground with each beat,
5344540	5347540	lighting fires and blazes all across the earth below.
5347540	5349540	Wait, wait. I can calm winds, it says here.
5349540	5351540	It doesn't look like it's winds.
5352540	5355540	Not even slow down a little bit, no?
5355540	5357540	It's too far off, anyway.
5357540	5360540	It looks like it's maybe about six miles off.
5360540	5362540	It'll be sometime before it gets here,
5362540	5364540	but it's definitely apocalyptic looking.
5364540	5367540	Looks like a storm's up, Rowan.
5369540	5372540	We've got to get out of here.
5372540	5375540	Okay, let's run. Everybody run to Rosebook.
5375540	5377540	Okay, I trot while levitating.
5377540	5379540	Hocus Pocus Body Flotus.
5379540	5381540	Hocus Pocus Body Flotus.
5381540	5386540	You arrive at Rosebook, you can see a ring of white monolithic pillars
5386540	5388540	each draped in bright red roses.
5388540	5391540	It kind of forms a fence around the city,
5391540	5393540	giving a very secured and beautiful appearance.
5393540	5396540	You can see the front gate of the city
5396540	5400540	as several farmers with various livestock are kind of ushered in
5400540	5404540	by a few city guards, the lead of which is a female paladin
5404540	5408540	in bright, shining armor kind of giving directions
5408540	5412540	to the city guardsmen and ushering people inside for safety.
5412540	5415540	This way. Move on by.
5415540	5417540	Looking good.
5417540	5419540	All right.
5420540	5422540	Mm-hmm.
5422540	5425540	You guys are close now. You're right up there at the front gate.
5425540	5427540	Aaron, did you write a new character for us?
5427540	5430540	Mm-hmm.
5430540	5433540	You, uh, female paladin, what is your name?
5433540	5435540	Yes, hello. Hi.
5435540	5438540	And maybe give us a lengthy backstory.
5440540	5444540	I pull up a rock and sit down for what I intend to be
5444540	5447540	a long period of backstory character development.
5447540	5451540	I send Avenger, my Belgian hawk,
5451540	5455540	to, uh, Avenger, give your battle cry
5455540	5457540	and go check out that storm.
5457540	5459540	So you don't risk anything, but see if you can get
5459540	5462540	an advantage point and report back.
5462540	5464540	Whoo-whoo!
5468540	5470540	Avenger takes flight.
5470540	5472540	It's gonna be some time before his return,
5472540	5474540	like at least five or ten minutes.
5474540	5478540	Well, yeah, so, uh, who's this tough guy here?
5478540	5480540	Hey, everybody.
5480540	5483540	My name is Dignity Sarsgaard.
5487540	5489540	I, uh, fight for truth.
5489540	5491540	I look for heroes. I support heroes.
5491540	5493540	I, myself, am a hero.
5493540	5495540	That's a brave stance.
5497540	5500540	You know what, my friends? Sometimes it is.
5500540	5502540	Sometimes it is brave, and I like to think of myself
5502540	5504540	as constantly brave.
5504540	5506540	Well, we just want to get in, so we'll just go,
5506540	5508540	nice to meet you. We're just gonna go past.
5508540	5510540	I saw you pull up a rock.
5514540	5517540	I'm from the town of Citrus.
5517540	5520540	You may have heard of a town covered in oranges.
5520540	5524540	Everyone wore orange. It was an orange-focused town.
5525540	5530540	But then one day, a rain thief, or a sun thief.
5530540	5532540	God, I wish it was a rain thief.
5533540	5534540	Came by and, uh...
5534540	5536540	I pull up another rock.
5537540	5540540	You know what, uh, enough about me.
5540540	5541540	You guys, uh...
5541540	5543540	No, we're just passing through.
5543540	5544540	We're just gonna get through the gate,
5544540	5545540	and thanks for the... How do you do?
5545540	5547540	Nice to meet you.
5547540	5550540	Yeah, but if, uh, hey, when you get off...
5554540	5556540	I just got off.
5557540	5559540	Me too.
5560540	5563540	Dumb, dumb. Stupid.
5563540	5566540	I didn't realize that you were on the job.
5566540	5569540	I, uh, I take a ten-hour shift every day
5569540	5573540	of looking for truth and honor in everything that I see and feel.
5573540	5577540	It's my own job that I put upon myself, but I would, uh...
5577540	5579540	I was looking for a gang to travel with,
5579540	5581540	and I like this rock-and-proof view.
5581540	5584540	We're still grieving over our lost friend.
5584540	5586540	I will join you.
5586540	5587540	It's too soon.
5587540	5588540	You need...
5588540	5590540	Too much has happened, uh, Stars Guard.
5590540	5591540	You need the tactics.
5591540	5592540	Stars Guard, too much has happened.
5592540	5593540	I will... Let's go!
5593540	5595540	No, no, no, no, no.
5595540	5596540	Stars Guard, we keep...
5596540	5599540	Like I always say, let's jazz for light.
5599540	5601540	What?
5601540	5602540	I just...
5602540	5604540	What?
5604540	5605540	What?
5605540	5606540	Jazz for light?
5606540	5608540	Guys, I pull a meeting with, uh...
5608540	5611540	with Sharpie and... and Christoperg.
5611540	5613540	I pull a sidebar.
5613540	5614540	Jazz for light?
5614540	5615540	Yeah, I... I...
5615540	5617540	I pull Sharpie and Christoperg aside and go,
5617540	5622540	guys, I got a really bad vibe off of Jake and I.
5622540	5623540	Off in the corner.
5623540	5625540	Zip it up, B!
5625540	5627540	Well, yeah, she's clearly...
5627540	5630540	No one paid her to be out here, and she's...
5630540	5632540	Look, we have enough on our plate.
5632540	5636540	We have enough on our plate right now.
5636540	5638540	Jazz for light?
5638540	5640540	She just strikes me as a kind of person.
5640540	5641540	We'll probably hang out with this for a while,
5641540	5643540	get bored of who she is and kill herself
5643540	5645540	and change her character.
5648540	5649540	It just seems like another one of these
5649540	5652540	weird identity crisis ladies we keep meeting.
5652540	5653540	All right, yeah, well, I...
5653540	5654540	Hey, everybody.
5654540	5655540	Thank you.
5655540	5656540	I thought... I thought maybe...
5656540	5657540	I'm sorry to... I know you guys are talking about...
5657540	5658540	Oh, Jesus Christ!
5658540	5659540	Hi.
5659540	5660540	Hi.
5660540	5664540	Uh, I just wanted to explain what jazzing for light means.
5664540	5665540	No, no, no, we got it.
5665540	5666540	We... we got it.
5666540	5667540	No, no, my...
5667540	5669540	I want you guys to take, you know, jazz like...
5670540	5671540	It doesn't make...
5671540	5672540	Improvisational jazz.
5672540	5673540	We're levitating a man who's dying.
5673540	5675540	It just means, like, you do whatever you...
5675540	5676540	We have to get this guy inside.
5676540	5678540	Right, okay, okay, I'll join you.
5678540	5679540	Okay!
5679540	5680540	Jesus.
5680540	5681540	Okay.
5681540	5682540	Nobody asked you.
5682540	5684540	Let's zoom for truth.
5686540	5687540	She's just changing her...
5687540	5689540	I pull another sidebar.
5689540	5691540	She just keeps making up catchphrases.
5691540	5692540	I gotta...
5692540	5693540	Trying way too hard.
5693540	5694540	I only have, like...
5694540	5696540	Trying way too hard.
5696540	5697540	I have...
5697540	5702540	My mana is at, like, 13%...
5702540	5703540	I gotta levitate.
5703540	5704540	This guy's gonna fall.
5704540	5705540	Yeah, we...
5705540	5707540	Hey, Dignity, we'll catch you on the flip-flop.
5707540	5708540	We gotta get this guy inside.
5708540	5709540	It was nice to meet you, really.
5709540	5710540	Nice to meet you.
5710540	5712540	I think our adventure days are over.
5712540	5714540	Yeah, we're kind of retiring.
5714540	5716540	I will absolutely join you.
5718540	5722540	One of my attributes is that I hear what God wants to hear.
5723540	5726540	I pull a third sidebar.
5726540	5730540	I go to the side, and I realize he's not talking to me, and I walk away.
5730540	5732540	I pull a third sidebar.
5732540	5734540	Sharpie, I'm gonna stab Dignity.
5734540	5735540	Sorry.
5735540	5736540	Now, come on.
5736540	5737540	We don't even have to...
5737540	5739540	Is there another guard there?
5739540	5740540	Can I ask?
5740540	5741540	I knew what direction.
5741540	5742540	This man is wounded.
5742540	5744540	He needs medical attention.
5744540	5745540	Oh, what?
5745540	5746540	Who do you talk to?
5746540	5748540	Well, I can heal.
5748540	5749540	Jesus Christ!
5750540	5751540	You can heal.
5751540	5753540	Dignity, we've had a long day.
5753540	5755540	This man's back is broken, I think.
5755540	5757540	Well, let me approach him.
5757540	5758540	And you got all burnt up.
5758540	5759540	Sorry, I didn't get it wrong.
5759540	5760540	And I got all burnt up.
5761540	5765540	I approach the broken back levitated man.
5765540	5766540	You do that.
5769540	5771540	I use heal.
5771540	5773540	I never thought I'd miss Maureen Sedona.
5773540	5777540	And I...
5777540	5779540	Yes, I use that.
5782540	5784540	Wow, my hero.
5788540	5790540	Well, heal skill is like just...
5790540	5791540	Okay, okay.
5791540	5792540	Well, under special...
5792540	5793540	Do you have a spell or a...?
5793540	5794540	I do.
5794540	5800540	Under special abilities, I have a 3d6 damage heal.
5800540	5801540	What is it?
5801540	5802540	What's it called?
5802540	5803540	Heals.
5803540	5804540	Is it called?
5804540	5805540	Yeah.
5805540	5806540	Sure.
5807540	5811540	You touch the man and heal him for 14 points of damage.
5811540	5814540	His various vertebrae crack back into place.
5814540	5819540	He still can't quite move, but he can wiggle his toes a bit.
5819540	5822540	It's taken a lot of convincing, but I will join you on your quest.
5822540	5824540	We're not on a quest.
5824540	5826540	We're kind of finishing a quest.
5826540	5829540	Well, I just wish I knew what was going on with Avenger right now.
5829540	5831540	Yeah, Avenger comes back.
5833540	5834540	Oh, he's fat.
5834540	5835540	He's five to ten minutes.
5840540	5842540	And when he does, you realize...
5842540	5845540	I realize that in Belgium they only have owls.
5847540	5850540	It's a small country and there's only so many birds of prey.
5853540	5860540	So he could see it looks like a blazing figure of light kind of flying towards you.
5861540	5862540	Looks dangerous.
5862540	5863540	It's big.
5863540	5865540	It's at least 30 feet big.
5866540	5868540	Stand behind me.
5869540	5870540	Do we trust him?
5871540	5873540	Well, I think we should get into the town, right?
5873540	5875540	I mean, these guys live in a place where there's...
5875540	5876540	I'm already in the town.
5876540	5878540	I walked away a long time ago.
5879540	5880540	I'm at a bar right now.
5881540	5888540	Is there an apothecary or a metasologist or a healer or a cleric?
5888540	5890540	There is a metasologist in the center of town.
5890540	5892540	This guy's back is still fucked up.
5892540	5893540	You did your best.
5893540	5894540	Thank you.
5894540	5897540	I don't like the look of this big glowing light thing that's coming our way, guys.
5898540	5902540	I gotta drop this guy off so I can wash my hands of him.
5903540	5904540	Here, come into the town.
5904540	5906540	I'll show you around.
5907540	5908540	I have a...
5909540	5910540	Spencer, what is it called?
5910540	5911540	Constabulary.
5911540	5912540	Constabulary.
5912540	5914540	Come to my constabulary.
5915540	5916540	I'm sorry.
5917540	5918540	Okay.
5919540	5920540	Is there a hospital?
5920540	5921540	Yes.
5921540	5926540	In the constabulary, there is a very sophisticated first aid kit.
5927540	5930540	And let's jam towards health.
5930540	5931540	All right.
5932540	5936540	So you killed your character off to become this completely different character.
5936540	5938540	The same confused person.
5940540	5941540	I don't know who you're talking to.
5941540	5942540	You're liberating.
5942540	5945540	I don't want to sit on stage with Reddit right now.
5945540	5948540	I would like to just do the show.
5949540	5953540	Maybe some people said something on Reddit and I thought I should kill myself.
5953540	5954540	It's different.
5954540	5956540	I am trying to move.
5956540	5959540	I am trying to sing towards light and truth.
5959540	5962540	You're playing the game based on Reddit comments?
5963540	5966540	I never go on there and defend myself.
5966540	5972540	I would like to just play the show and, you know, just go be positive
5972540	5976540	and not worry about what, you know.
5976540	5978540	Douchekoo69.
5980540	5981540	Bartman.
5982540	5983540	SpongeBob.
5983540	5987540	I mean, the reason why I killed my character is because I was talking about it for so long.
5987540	5991540	And then last week I felt like it was the right thing to do.
5993540	5996540	And we can talk about that if you want.
5996540	5998540	But I just I felt like it was the right thing to do.
5998540	6001540	And I realize this is also what I did in our private game.
6001540	6004540	You responded to web negativity and that's why you're changing the character.
6004540	6006540	Not because you wanted to try another thing.
6006540	6009540	I mean, you've been so positive towards my character
6009540	6012540	that I don't know why I wouldn't want to live on forever.
6012540	6013540	I mean, you've been such a...
6013540	6015540	I've been the biggest supporter of your gameplay.
6015540	6017540	I find you delightful.
6017540	6018540	Jeff.
6020540	6022540	This is starting to feel mean.
6025540	6027540	This guy needs a hospital.
6027540	6029540	I don't understand.
6032540	6033540	Let's go. Let's go.
6033540	6035540	I whistle.
6035540	6038540	Oh, I whistle and it sounds very similar to...
6043540	6046540	I whistle and a beautiful brown horse rides up.
6046540	6050540	I found this horse wandering around.
6050540	6052540	It's Coco.
6053540	6055540	You recognize...
6056540	6058540	You guys recognize it as Coco.
6058540	6060540	I lift everyone. I put them on Coco.
6060540	6062540	Can we just call you Mulrain?
6062540	6065540	Because you remind us so much of our friend that just died?
6065540	6068540	I resent this right now, Jeff.
6068540	6070540	Who's Jeff?
6072540	6075540	Exactly. Who is Jeff?
6075540	6077540	Nothing.
6078540	6082540	I am not like Mulrain. I heard about Mulrain.
6082540	6084540	I take the guy over my shoulder and I take him inside the fort.
6084540	6085540	My vibes.
6085540	6087540	That hurts really bad.
6087540	6089540	You're healed now, aren't you?
6089540	6091540	I'm healed. I can't put him back down.
6091540	6094540	My arm's not broken anymore. My neck.
6094540	6097540	He needs to be levitated to a goddamn healer.
6097540	6106540	I'm going to start walking with Coco towards the medicine cabinet inside the cop house.
6106540	6108540	Constabulary, thank you.
6108540	6110540	Two guards come out of the constabularians.
6110540	6115540	They look at you and they run over with a stretcher and grab the guy and start stretching him along.
6115540	6118540	These guys are super fun.
6119540	6120540	They're really nice guys.
6120540	6122540	Thanks, Dignity.
6122540	6124540	You're welcome, Joe.
6124540	6126540	She remembered.
6133540	6135540	Where was I? Hold up.
6135540	6140540	Avenger, when you saw this thing coming, how soon did you reckon it would get here,
6140540	6144540	based on its speed and your hawk knowledge?
6145540	6147540	Ten minutes.
6150540	6152540	Is that right, ten minutes?
6152540	6155540	I mean, you know, hawk time is like four times faster or something.
6155540	6157540	Forty minutes?
6157540	6159540	Here's the thing about me.
6159540	6164540	All of my spells are depleted and have been for like nine gaming sessions.
6164540	6169540	I was thinking that too, but there was a good three weeks that you guys were regenerating spells
6169540	6171540	and traveling to the purple mountains.
6171540	6172540	Oh, okay.
6172540	6174540	I think you're good.
6174540	6175540	Good.
6175540	6177540	I mean, rest is always nice.
6177540	6179540	Yeah, can I make you guys some tea?
6179540	6182540	Yeah, you guys are in the constabulary.
6182540	6184540	There's men with guard outfits.
6184540	6185540	They're red and white uniforms.
6185540	6187540	They're kind of walking in and out.
6187540	6191540	There's a large sitting room where you're kind of near with tables and benches
6191540	6196540	and a few off-duty guards sitting and drinking and talking.
6196540	6199540	No, these guys.
6202540	6209540	I pull up a table and I put down tea for everybody.
6209540	6211540	It's a dry city.
6211540	6212540	Sorry?
6212540	6213540	It's a dry city.
6213540	6214540	For alcohol.
6214540	6215540	That's white tea.
6215540	6216540	That's white tea.
6216540	6217540	Sorry?
6217540	6218540	Everyone's drinking tea.
6218540	6219540	Yes.
6219540	6223540	Even those guys drinking earlier were drinking tea.
6223540	6228540	I wouldn't mind going and finding out these crystal crabs and shit that we've gotten.
6228540	6229540	The purple cave are worth.
6229540	6230540	Remember those things?
6230540	6231540	Oh yeah.
6231540	6234540	Yeah, those crab things.
6234540	6238540	Is there someone in town that could appraise those items for us?
6238540	6239540	Who are you talking to?
6239540	6242540	One of the red guards.
6242540	6243540	I don't know.
6243540	6246540	I'm off duty.
6246540	6248540	Isn't anybody on duty?
6248540	6252540	No one on duty is in the room.
6252540	6253540	She's off duty, right?
6253540	6254540	You're off duty?
6254540	6257540	Yeah, I'm off duty spiritually.
6257540	6260540	In fact, she doesn't even work here.
6260540	6263540	Who knows, man?
6263540	6268540	Spencer, do I know of a guy?
6268540	6269540	A what?
6269540	6271540	What was it we were just looking for?
6271540	6272540	I don't know.
6272540	6275540	I told the guards, I warned them.
6275540	6279540	In 40 minutes or so, there's a giant storm brewing that's coming our way.
6279540	6281540	We need to defend the city.
6281540	6285540	Do you guys have defenses in an army that can protect us?
6285540	6287540	Yes.
6287540	6290540	Your sense of urgency worries me.
6290540	6293540	That was me, the dungeon master, because you weren't asking anybody.
6293540	6294540	I was asking the guard.
6294540	6295540	They are off duty.
6295540	6299540	Do I know, Spencer, as dignity?
6299540	6304540	I appeal to their desire to be alive later on, whether they're working or not.
6304540	6310540	As dignity, do I know, as dignity, do I have knowledge of who's in charge of defense for the city?
6310540	6314540	Yeah, I mean, the guy who's in charge of everything, including the defense of the city,
6314540	6318540	is the main patriarch whose name is Father Tender.
6318540	6319540	All right.
6319540	6320540	Hey.
6320540	6321540	Hi.
6321540	6322540	Don't have to ask me twice.
6322540	6323540	Hey, little guy.
6323540	6324540	Oh, no.
6324540	6325540	Look up.
6325540	6326540	Hey.
6326540	6327540	Hi.
6327540	6329540	My name is Quark.
6329540	6330540	Quark.
6330540	6331540	Yes.
6331540	6332540	Dignity.
6332540	6333540	Hello.
6333540	6334540	Hi.
6334540	6336540	Thank you for the warm reception.
6336540	6337540	You got it.
6337540	6339540	I heard you talking.
6339540	6341540	I would like to introduce you to the...
6341540	6342540	I know.
6342540	6344540	You keep coming up into our sidebars.
6344540	6345540	Yeah.
6345540	6346540	Twice a week.
6346540	6348540	I wash my hair twice a week.
6348540	6354540	So I would like to introduce you to a very special person.
6354540	6356540	He's right around the corner.
6356540	6357540	Can I lead you there?
6357540	6359540	I know you're talking about defense.
6359540	6360540	Yes.
6360540	6364540	As a new member of your gang that will forever be with you and never leave, I would like to
6364540	6365540	show you...
6365540	6370540	No matter, even if someone says on Reddit to change your character, this one's here to
6370540	6371540	stay.
6371540	6375540	Look, I'm not looking for more compliments.
6375540	6377540	All right.
6377540	6379540	So I lead them.
6379540	6383540	I gesture to them and walk out and show them Father Tender's.
6383540	6388540	Yeah, but before you could even open the door, the doors swing wide and you can see Father
6388540	6391540	Tender himself striding through.
6391540	6396540	He's a very handsome older man in white robes embroidered with red roses.
6396540	6399540	He marches inside with guardsmen to his left and to his right.
6399540	6402540	He says, greetings, guardsmen.
6402540	6403540	Father Tender here.
6403540	6404540	Thank you for your service.
6404540	6407540	You're all doing a fine job.
6407540	6412540	Then he looks at Quark and his face hardens.
6412540	6414540	He glances over at Dignity.
6414540	6417540	Dignity, who are all these new faces?
6417540	6423540	These are my best friends.
6423540	6424540	These are my best friends.
6424540	6426540	These are my potential lovers.
6426540	6430540	These are my future adventure haver together withers.
6430540	6434540	These are the most important people on the face of the planet.
6434540	6436540	This is Quark.
6436540	6438540	He's great.
6438540	6440540	And this is Sharpie.
6440540	6442540	I overheard your name.
6442540	6444540	He's very strong.
6444540	6451540	This is Avenger.
6451540	6455540	And this is Christoper who's been quietly listening.
6455540	6458540	Pleased to meet you.
6458540	6461540	He's very fancy.
6461540	6464540	My new friends are concerned with the safety of the city,
6464540	6470540	and I would like to help them protect the city because they feel like a good day to us.
6470540	6472540	There's a big weight ball coming.
6472540	6473540	Oh, I know.
6473540	6475540	You're adventurous, huh?
6475540	6477540	It's dangerous work, isn't it?
6477540	6480540	Brings danger all around, doesn't it?
6480540	6482540	There's a big weight ball coming.
6482540	6485540	We like danger so much here in Roseville.
6485540	6486540	Are you animatronic?
6486540	6488540	No, no.
6488540	6490540	We follow our beliefs strictly,
6490540	6496540	and the Rosicrucian Codex clearly states that danger is evil.
6496540	6498540	And right now we've got a whole lot of it.
6498540	6500540	I don't know if you know out there,
6500540	6505540	but there's a demon coming right for us blasting hellfire and screaming bloody murder.
6505540	6507540	And I think you're behind it, gnome.
6507540	6509540	Gnomes are always trouble.
6509540	6511540	I'm not behind it.
6511540	6512540	I just came in here.
6512540	6514540	We just brought a gnome in.
6514540	6515540	Yeah, he points at the broken gnome.
6515540	6518540	Ever since this gnome has been coming through town,
6518540	6521540	making immoral drinks and poisoning our citizens,
6521540	6523540	we've lost our God's favor.
6523540	6525540	If you could excuse me, I need to pray.
6525540	6529540	Our clerics are already at the Soul Rods, reinforcing our wards.
6529540	6532540	He looks over at Dignity with a lecherous gaze and says,
6532540	6535540	you know, my Soul Rod's already rigidly reinforced.
6536540	6542540	So as he walks out, he says, feel free to stop by my juicery
6542540	6545540	if anyone wants me to give him my special juice.
6546540	6551540	New friends, you don't want the special juice.
6551540	6552540	It's not that special.
6552540	6556540	Everyone in this town can generate it, and his is warm.
6556540	6560540	Hey, Sharpie, Chris, let's get the hell out of this town.
6560540	6562540	I don't like the looks of Father Tender.
6562540	6563540	I don't like anything about this town.
6563540	6564540	We dropped the guy off.
6564540	6565540	We did our duty.
6565540	6566540	Let's just keep moving.
6566540	6567540	Yeah.
6567540	6568540	I run out.
6568540	6571540	Can I run out after Father Tender and use diplomacy?
6571540	6572540	Sure.
6572540	6573540	Okay.
6573540	6574540	Chase after Father Tender.
6574540	6575540	What are you saying?
6575540	6583540	I'm saying, Father Tender, this gnome is not responsible for this demon.
6583540	6588540	This gnome is necessary to the safety of this town,
6588540	6593540	and you should treat this gnome like the special guest that he is.
6593540	6595540	Ah, you're right.
6595540	6596540	I'll do that.
6596540	6598540	But I got my eye on him.
6598540	6602540	If you guys bring any more trouble, you're all fucked.
6609540	6612540	It's what he says when he leaves every room.
6612540	6615540	It's his thing.
6615540	6618540	And he traipses out.
6618540	6619540	All right.
6619540	6620540	I don't know.
6620540	6621540	I feel bad for this town.
6621540	6622540	There's a thing coming.
6622540	6624540	I don't feel bad about this town at all.
6624540	6627540	We've got a shitty reception from the get-go.
6627540	6628540	Yeah.
6628540	6629540	I guess you're right.
6629540	6634540	We've done worse things than people who have done less to us.
6634540	6635540	Wait.
6635540	6636540	Do we still have a robot baby with us?
6636540	6637540	Oh, yeah.
6637540	6638540	Yeah.
6638540	6639540	Just checking.
6639540	6641540	And a power unit and 300 gold.
6641540	6643540	He could have been the robot baby.
6643540	6644540	Fuck.
6644540	6646540	Oh, yeah.
6646540	6648540	That's on me, man.
6648540	6650540	You're doing a great hawk, though.
6651540	6653540	The hawk is the highlight of my life.
6653540	6654540	The noise is the best.
6654540	6655540	That's my new ringtone.
6655540	6657540	How far is it?
6657540	6660540	I go up to the walls, the rosy walls of Rosebook,
6660540	6663540	and look over and check out the light storm coming towards me.
6663540	6665540	You can see the light storm drying nearer.
6665540	6668540	It's coming way faster than you'd ever expected.
6668540	6672540	And as it nears, you can hear a voice calling out from the void.
6672540	6675540	It sounds like, yeow!
6675540	6677540	Oh, shit.
6677540	6679540	Heading straight towards the town
6679540	6681540	and within instance, it's upon you,
6681540	6683540	but crashing towards the town,
6683540	6687540	it smashes directly into solid air above the town.
6687540	6690540	You see white wards sizzling and popping in midair,
6690540	6694540	burning the angel's flesh and compelling it outside of the city.
6694540	6696540	It circles around a few times,
6696540	6698540	crashing into the barrier for longer.
6698540	6700540	It stands firm.
6700540	6702540	Yoshi, the angel, right?
6702540	6703540	Yomiji?
6703540	6704540	Yomiji.
6704540	6705540	Yomiji, yeah.
6705540	6706540	Toshiba?
6706540	6709540	You can't seem to get into the barrier.
6709540	6711540	Wow, the soul rods kept him out.
6711540	6713540	I told you.
6713540	6718540	Aside from that guy's lack of sexual harassment training,
6718540	6722540	I guess he's an effective leader.
6722540	6725540	He's got this place buckled down.
6725540	6727540	One of the guards speaks up.
6727540	6731540	He's like, you know, that guy wasn't always a perv.
6731540	6733540	Uh, hi.
6733540	6735540	That's all. See ya.
6735540	6738540	This is a weird city.
6738540	6741540	So we're safe. We're good.
6741540	6743540	It's over.
6743540	6744540	Crisis inverted?
6744540	6747540	Where do we go next?
6747540	6750540	I walk out of the constabulary and walk into town
6750540	6753540	to see if there's anyone...
6753540	6757540	Are we going to try to cash in our little crystal crab thingies?
6757540	6759540	Everyone seems kind of occupied,
6759540	6761540	looking at a giant flaming angel demon.
6761540	6763540	Is it still just hovering out there?
6763540	6766540	Yeah, it's attacking this barrier immensely.
6766540	6767540	It's still trying to get in.
6767540	6768540	It didn't give up.
6768540	6770540	Yeah, it's like a velociraptor, Texas thing.
6770540	6772540	The weakness is an electrical fence.
6772540	6774540	I don't think we're leaving this place
6774540	6776540	until we take care of this guy.
6776540	6778540	Is there a wise man in town, a dignity?
6778540	6779540	No.
6779540	6781540	Do we know that there's a wise man?
6781540	6782540	Or a wise woman?
6782540	6786540	I mean, hello, and also...
6786540	6791540	I mean, Father Tender is basically our wise man,
6791540	6794540	and you saw how wise he is.
6794540	6798540	I mean, it could be the first on a list
6798540	6802540	of many harrowing great adventures for you
6802540	6805540	to join me in defending this city,
6805540	6812540	and we can all jam towards the light.
6812540	6816540	And if there was ever someone I wanted to jam towards light with,
6816540	6819540	I mean, I think it would be you.
6819540	6826540	You're very particular.
6826540	6828540	And I like that.
6828540	6830540	I like how particular you are.
6830540	6833540	I realize you just lost your friend.
6833540	6835540	I don't think you care at all.
6835540	6836540	Really?
6836540	6837540	No.
6837540	6838540	I know, of course I do.
6838540	6840540	You never met her.
6840540	6842540	You don't know how much we cared about her.
6842540	6843540	I have her horse.
6843540	6847540	I fucked that horse.
6847540	6850540	Well, then you love her.
6850540	6853540	I'm saying maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
6853540	6856540	We've had a very long day.
6856540	6859540	The last thing you want is more adventures.
6859540	6861540	We've had it up to here with adventures.
6861540	6862540	I understand.
6862540	6864540	Well, then come to the flat where I'm staying,
6864540	6866540	and I sit on...
6866540	6870540	I made a blanket fort.
6870540	6872540	I made a blanket fort.
6872540	6874540	You're not concerned about this angel attacking?
6874540	6876540	No, I am, but you're telling me that you're tired.
6876540	6878540	I'm saying this when we first met.
6878540	6879540	You wanted to go on more adventures,
6879540	6881540	and I'm saying, look, it was like we're tired.
6881540	6883540	Your friend just got killed.
6883540	6885540	Well, she killed herself.
6885540	6890540	Jeff, say we don't want to go on any more adventures again.
6890540	6893540	But say my name is my actual name.
6893540	6895540	Quark.
6895540	6897540	We don't want to go on any more adventures.
6897540	6901540	Well, Quark, and I look up at the angel.
6901540	6904540	I don't think the adventure cares.
6905540	6908540	Wait, wait, wait.
6908540	6910540	And then...
6910540	6912540	I'll say my line again.
6912540	6913540	I'll say my line again.
6913540	6914540	Then you say your line again,
6914540	6918540	and I want to hear adventure just like this.
6918540	6921540	Just kind of chime in after you.
6921540	6922540	You know what?
6922540	6924540	But make it a special adventure cry
6924540	6928540	that has a little bit of fear in it,
6928540	6930540	or kind of like a cliffhanger.
6930540	6932540	Yeah, foreboding.
6932540	6935540	Like, ominous, like...
6935540	6937540	Yeah, yeah, pressure.
6937540	6938540	You know what, Sharpie?
6938540	6940540	I don't want to go on any more adventures.
6940540	6944540	Well, Quark, I don't think the adventure cares.
6950540	6954540	Let's hear it for Levi from Belgium, everybody.
6954540	6956540	Pietro from London.
6956540	6959540	Thank you very much, sir.
6959540	6961540	Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden.
