0	25560	Hi! Hi everybody! Hello! I'm Akisha. Welcome to Harbin Town! I'm your cop
25560	35640	controller, Duncan Trussell! Now, welcome to the stage, your mayor, Dan Harmon!
41160	41960	All right, thank you!
45080	51000	Another big crowd. You haven't been here lately. No, I haven't. A lot of big crowds lately.
51720	57960	That's good! It's that Yahoo influence. Yep. A lot of people with those Yahoo email addresses.
58920	62120	You know, I'm doing a TV show for Yahoo now. I don't even know if you know that. I haven't
62120	65720	talked to you in a long time. I know that. I do know that. Okay. I don't know how it's associated
65720	70600	with Netanyahu though, but... No, I mean, I don't think they ever claimed that it should be.
70600	75560	Like, that was just a coincidence. We're all tied into Netanyahu though. I mean, everyone's
75560	80840	tied to Netanyahu. Yes. Because he's starting World War III, so... It's a serious issue, and
82200	89960	you should apply for the appropriate email domain to reflect that. Guest, guest comptroller Duncan
89960	101160	Trussell, everybody! Jeff is in Nashville. We don't know why. Jeff's just in Nashville. He's
101240	107880	just hanging out. He's Instagramming. He's dicking around. He's captioning things like,
107880	111880	I'm finally home. So, so fuck you.
115320	118840	Fine. Go home. You really don't know why he's there? No, I never know. I don't ask.
120280	122280	The thing with Jeff is, you don't want to encourage him.
124360	129320	I just, you don't want to, you know, you don't want to ask him things and go to him with needs.
129720	132520	He abuses it. That's what they said about John Wayne Gacy.
137080	143320	They said that you don't want to encourage him. Don't ask him questions. He likes to dress like
143320	148360	a clown, hang out with kids. It's fine. But also don't encourage him. I bet a lot of people
148360	152920	encourage John Wayne Gacy. That's the thing. Like, if you encourage Jeff Davis, you're going to have
152920	159800	a John Wayne Gacy situation under your hands in like two weeks tops. All right. So what do we
159800	168120	talk about tonight? Let's see here. Bring up my Evernote. One thing I would like to talk about is
168120	175400	the Uber ride that I had to work today. I had to, I had to drive to work and didn't want to drive,
175400	181480	took an Uber. And the guy, sometimes the Uber app, you can see the black car and you can watch.
181480	186760	Sometimes the guy, it's foreshadowing. Like, you know, you got a bad guy. It's like the black car
186760	193320	is like driving around in circles all around. Like, it's just going around your house. You're
193320	197240	just watching it. It's like, like if you're watching like a six-year-old play Pac-Man, you're,
197240	201480	there's like this car icon going around. Like, oh, that's one of these guys. Guy pulls up. Now I'm
201480	206840	late for work. I get, but I'm the boss who cares. But, but, but I, I get in the thing and then you
206840	210120	have that conversation. You're like, okay, these are more red flags. Because you're like, okay,
210120	221640	I'm going to Burbank. And he's like, Bur-bork? And I'm like, Burbank, Burbank. It's like B-O-R-M-A-R-T?
221640	229320	No, that's, that's Bormark. That's, that's a fictional planet. Uh, Burbank. Like, you can't
229320	234520	have not been here long enough that you could do, like, like it's Burbank. And it's fine that you,
234520	239640	if you're that new, but why are you driving anyone anywhere for money? That's insane. I'm the,
239640	246280	I'm not driving and I've been here for 20 years because I'm afraid I'll get lost. And as I call
246280	252040	you, Bormark. So he types the thing in and then he's like, he can't, he can't get out of my
252040	256200	neighborhood. He doesn't know where the thing is. It's like, and I was driving around and I'm,
256200	261080	go left and they'll go right. Now you're the thing. He gets in the freeway. He starts going 90 miles
261080	266280	per hour to Burbank. And then I'm like, okay, this is, this is how I die. And I'm going to,
267080	270440	but I'm not going out. I'm not going to be one of these people that dies going,
270440	273880	I don't want to die. I'm going to, I'm going to go out checking my emails. So I check,
275240	279160	check my email. And then I'm looking at it and getting grossed in that stuff. And then
279160	286200	I feel the car slowing. I feel it. And then I, uh, I look up and, uh, I'm like, how can we,
286200	289880	why are we slowing? I didn't feel us get off anything. Like, like, usually there's more of
289880	294760	that kind of like events where your unconscious brain knows you're getting off the freeway. I
294840	299320	don't tell you whether you're listening. So I look up and there's this exit at Burbank
300200	305320	and you can either go west or east. And so there's a little fork there, but you're on
305320	315880	the freeway. He has stopped his SUV. Uh, not, probably not his SUV, probably a family member's
315880	321240	SUV. And he, and he is like, he's going, sir. And I, and I looked up and I went, oh Jesus.
322200	331160	And he went, yeah. And I went west wherever the thing that you put. And he's like, okay. And he
331160	336280	starts the car on the freeway and it keeps going like it was his driveway. And like, this was all
336280	342360	normal. Then he pulls over the thing. So in the, in the, after that, so the block span between that
342360	347240	and getting dropped off at Starburns Industries in Burbank, where I went, went to work today,
347720	353960	uh, uh, I, I'm thinking to myself, all right, Harmon, this is it. You're giving this guy less
353960	360680	than five stars. Finally, this is it. Like, I've never done it before. I've never done it.
360680	364360	Cause there's this thing with the Uber culture where you're like, they, they're so, it's just
364360	368440	like you feel the people that you would might give four stars. The whole reason you might give
368440	373800	them four stars. I create this backstory for them. And I'm like, well, then they're fucked. And
373800	377640	like, like, like, how is that going to help society? And like, like, like maybe the bad
377640	384280	drivers should get more encouragement. And I'm not going to be the guy that like knocks a guy off
384280	391960	the fucking Qbert, you know, thing. And there was a thing called Qbert. Look at him. So I,
391960	397160	in the one block I'm resolved. I'm like four stars. That's enough for this guy. He stopped
397160	404760	on the freeway. Four stars. I'm thinking he pulls up to the curb to let me out. And, uh,
406200	412840	okay. So, so, and then I'm like, thank you. And an Uber exchange, like you don't have to change any
412840	416440	money. That's the nice thing about Uber is like, you're done. You can leap out of the car and run
416440	423000	away. And he pulls up to his staff and he turns back and he says like, okay, thank you very much.
423000	427400	It's so nice. Thank you very much. And I don't know if that's a fair accent or if that's,
428440	433960	and I don't know what it's like. So, and I, and I go, thank you. Thank you. And I swear to God,
434520	437800	this is what I heard. I can't verify that this is what he said.
438360	442440	This is exactly what I heard. He said, I make a five stars.
442440	453640	And I almost started crying as I got out and I fucking, you better, I wish I could give him
453640	463320	six stars. I make a five stars. He sounded like fucking Mario. I'm making the cake for my wife
463320	470280	today. I drive you all around. I make a five stars. I couldn't fucking deal with it. It was like the
470280	476280	guy in Saving Private Ryan, Benny Grebel, Benny Grebel. That's how the Holocaust happens, man.
477160	483640	Okay. Connect those dots. I thought that's how you avoid the Holocaust. You have to,
483640	490920	here's the thing. That guy, what happens the next time he stops on the interstate?
490920	496520	Right. That's the guy. That's the guy that puts the knife at the end of Saving Private Ryan.
497400	501960	Oh, no, no, no. I make a five stars. I make a five stars.
503720	506920	You're right. You're right. You're right. Hundreds of people could die.
506920	510120	You're right. Hundreds of people. You're right. I fucked up. I fucked up again. I fucked up.
512360	517960	We need a special Uber drone that follows Uber passengers and checks up on their rating so that
517960	522760	you can wait their rating. Because I'm just going to give you five stars if you fucking pick me up.
522760	528280	That's it. Because I can't handle it. I can't handle the pressure. I got off on it. I got off
528280	534120	on the idea when it was introduced because I was so sick of the no-star taxi system,
534120	539640	where the only rule was that you call a taxi and if they got time for you, they'll try to make the
539640	545560	time. And if you at all don't fit into their system, you can go fuck yourself. And there's
545560	549800	no communication and it's a public utility and they have a monopoly. And so when Uber came out,
549800	555160	it was like, fuck the police. Yeah. I don't know how the police are involved, but fuck everybody.
556200	560840	Fuck the taxi police. And it was like, it was so great because you felt the fear. You could feel
560840	565080	the fear. You could taste it. Everybody that picked you up was like, oh shit, I don't know how to Uber,
565080	571400	right? And it was just like fucking everything had turned on its ear. The consumer was in control.
571400	577640	The people ruled. Capitalism was being presented in its proper form. There were people competing
577640	583800	for your favor. It felt good, but it had nothing to do. And then slowly but surely, you know, your
583800	587880	girlfriend gets an Uber ride. She's like, that guy was creepy. What do you mean? Oh, I'll tell you a
587880	598760	story. What did you do? I gave him three stars. Jesus. I think it's our hitchhiking. It's like
598760	604040	our generations hitchhiking. Like when you talk to people from the sixties, it was a normal thing
604040	609240	to like just hitch a ride. It wasn't something that would, that now if you, if you hear someone
609240	615320	is a hitchhiker or is hitchhiked, you look at them in terror because the idea is like one out of
615320	622200	three hitchhikers ends up in an alligator's stomach in a swamp. Can we talk about that for a second?
622200	628680	Because like, like it's that thing, like, like, what are these, what are these social changes
628680	634600	that happen? How much are they reflective of actual incidents? Because, uh, like, like, we're
634600	639880	all aware. Some of you are so young that you might have been aware of the transition, but, um, this
639880	652040	society is obsessed with fucking children. Like, if you mention a child, if you mention, if you say,
652040	657320	oh, my cousin, I went with my 11 year old cousin to the thing, someone in the writer's room, someone
657320	662360	around you is going to, is going to tee up the fuck that like, like, like the fact that like,
662360	667400	yes, it's like the young child, like the dot connection to it's called the Nancy Grace effect.
669720	675880	It's like, it's, it's from Nancy Grace because if you watch, if you've watched Nancy Grace for
675880	682680	more than two episodes and then you drive down the road and see a kid alone, something will flash
682680	691640	through your mind where you're like, should I rape and kill that kid? Yeah, exactly. Thank you
691640	699160	for putting into words what I couldn't, I don't know why that was hard to articulate. No, but
699160	704360	seriously, on a, on a, on a more gray level than that, but, but, but, I mean, that's the comedic
704360	709720	glib, exaggerated thing that the condition that we're, uh, it's like, but that's what we're all,
709720	715080	it starts with people telling you that everyone out there wants to fuck your kid. Right. And then
715080	720120	that turns into a joke, like, because it's like, it's, it's in the zeitgeist. So it's like kid
720120	726600	fucking, that's a thing. Hey, everybody hear about the kid fucking? The thing about kid fucking
726600	738040	is that it's zero overhead as a, as a, as a, as a news item, as a, as a rumor, as a myth.
738040	745160	It is zero overhead. It costs nothing to create that myth. Right. And it profits you myth,
745160	752600	mythically, like a thousand percent, like zero risk, high yield. If you're in the business of
752600	757720	affecting people or you sell, if you're an advertiser, because if there's a, a famous
757720	765080	if a child rapist gets arrested, then that creates more viewers to the news. Absolutely. Everyone
765080	770520	wants to know, oh my God, did you hear there's a guy, he fucked a kid to news at 11. I'm like,
770520	774920	oh God, well I want to, what does he look like? Or how did he do it? What does he, what did he say
774920	780680	to do it? What, what's it, how would it look like when he did it? We're fucking horrible people. And
780680	785080	we watch the Sopranos and we watch casino and we watch the, the, the, the, every time somebody
785080	790120	eats a bunch of people, puts their heads in the fridge of the idea of kid fucking, uh, we, we,
790600	803480	it's, it's perfectly fine for us to be, uh, fucking voyeuristically, uh, fucking stirred up by the
803480	810040	shit because my God, I mean, like, of course, if you're in a society and you're happy, one of the,
810040	813960	one of the biggest things you're going to think about is what if this all fell apart? Holy shit.
813960	818840	Like if you build a city in Minecraft, like, like, like you start to think about, oh shit,
818840	824920	how do I keep this safe from creepers? I, I, I put it, I, I put it in terms our audience could
824920	831640	understand. It's a, you, as soon as you have something cool going, you know, of course your
831640	836760	next thought is what, what if, what if, what if somebody fucks it up? So you love your kid,
836760	840920	you love your kid like my mom did. He's six years old. You take him to the shopping mall.
840920	845240	Uh, I got to go to the bathroom. My mom's, uh, not a boy. So she's not going to come in the boy's
845240	848920	room with me. I don't know. I'm at them at that age. Like I've got to go to the bathroom by myself
848920	852600	at the mall. My mom's going to wait outside at Orange Julius. What's she going to say to me?
853320	858760	She's going to say, well, I'll tell you what she did say. Don't talk to anybody. Don't let anybody
858760	862120	touch you because there are guys out there that'll try to talk to you and touch you. And then
862120	869000	they'll cut off your penis with a knife. Good mom, good mom. Like, I'm like, really, in the strictest
869000	875080	sense. Good mom. Like, like, like in the, in the, in the, in terms of like keeping your kid from
875080	880280	getting his car cut off, like doing her job individually. But then we were part of this
880280	884840	honeycomb and it's like now you clicking forward on emails. Oh, there's a guy out there. He's,
884840	888840	he's waiting the toys are in his parking lot. And what he does is he puts a Donald duck under the
888840	892680	tire and then he puts a key next to it. When you get the keys, sucks on your dick and he cuts it
892680	896840	off and he puts it in the Donald duck and then he mails it. And if you don't forward this,
896840	903960	it could happen to you. It just, it just becomes this thing of people and all the energy behind
903960	913000	it though, as you said before, it's like, it's driven by this insane, like primal fear we have
913000	919800	underneath us. You know, like people who are tremendously afraid of heights, like me, like if
919800	925160	you, when they look over a balcony, what they'll tell people, because we've studied these people
925240	932360	for ages, there is an inextricable phenomenon involved in the tremendous fear of heights
933160	939400	that it makes no sense, but it's like you feel as you're looking over the edge of the balcony,
939960	947480	like you're going to jump off, like you want to jump off, like you know how and you could really
947480	953240	easily and you fantasize about what it would be like to jump off. And that's what vertigo is
953240	957880	all about or vertigo is not the phrase, but just that, that fear that people feel when they,
957880	963400	they can't go near the edge of the balcony. They feel like I'm, I'm only a couple quick born
963400	969160	identity moves for just, yes. And I know exactly what they are because I'm afraid of heights.
970280	976920	People, everybody is, has become obsessed with fucking children. We are looking at children now
976920	982280	and going like, Oh, I wonder if anyone thinks I'd like to fuck that kid. That's the end result,
982280	987320	isn't it? That's why it's, that's why it's the, the, the, it's, there's something so satanic about
987320	994280	the fact that the reason we all know about childfuckers is not because there's some organization
994280	998760	that really wants to get the news of childfuckers out into the world. The reason we know about
998760	1004040	childfuckers is that people tend to stay through the commercial break to find out about the
1004040	1009560	childfucker. Well, that's, that's a really dark thing when you realize that every time a child
1009560	1016520	gets fucked, then it sells a certain amount of iPhones or cars. Yeah. So like, there's like a
1016520	1022600	profit that the profit of like big of corporations increases. Every time a child is fucked,
1022600	1028680	there's a direct profit increase that happens. That's where it gets like, if someone came up to
1028680	1032440	you on a wall, if you're walking down the sidewalk and the guy comes up to you and he's like, Hey,
1033240	1037800	do you want to hear this story about a child that got raped and fucked? And you're like,
1037800	1044600	yeah, I'd love to. And he's like, okay, great, but let me tell you about the new iPhone before I tell
1044600	1052040	you. What the fuck's wrong with you? It's so dark. But that's what the news does every single night.
1052920	1058200	That's their function. But it is. And so I mean, the big question is, and it's not a rhetorical
1058200	1063080	question because I don't know because it's, I was raised in the 70s, so lots of stuff has changed.
1063080	1070280	The population of the planet has doubled. Is there actually more of this going on?
1071640	1077080	Don't know. I think, you know, I was hoping maybe somebody in the audience would go like,
1077080	1085640	I am a child fuck statistician. It's increased 200%. But I would even then say it's like, well,
1085640	1090840	okay, it increased 200%. So did the population. But it's bad to fuck kids now. Like Socrates,
1091480	1098360	it's as bad as ever. No, it used to be okay. Socrates was like a legendary child fucker,
1098360	1103560	right? Like that was like, if you read like, if you read some of Socrates writings,
1104680	1109400	he's like talks about like, there's some terrible, it's free on Kindle. I remember like
1109400	1114920	stumbling upon it. But it's like really spooky because it's like Socrates like talking, like
1114920	1120680	trying to seduce like a 14 year old boy. It's like a process of like, so I think that's why
1120680	1125480	they gave him a hemlock. I think that's why they killed him is because he was constantly fucking
1125480	1131720	kids. And it used to be okay, but it used to be okay. Like now it's bad, but it used to be okay.
1131720	1137880	Guys, I didn't invent this. It's I do think that like, it wasn't an okay thing at one point.
1137880	1150520	I make a five stars. So can you can you tell me about these Japanese robots you were telling
1150520	1158520	me about? Yes, very excited about this. Next, next year, they're they're releasing like the first
1158520	1166600	consumer based rope, like humanoid robot that has like it has hands. I've the videos I've seen,
1166600	1173800	it mostly just seems to like dance and stuff. But it has it has like a thumb and hands that seem
1173800	1177960	to work really well, which means that it theoretically is going to be able to like go to
1177960	1185960	your refrigerator, bring you a beer, see you to death in the night. If someone hacks it.
1187560	1192920	But yeah, these are coming out next year. It's like the very first wave of robots that are going
1192920	1199320	to inhabit our homes within the next 20 years. When you go to someone's house, if they don't
1199320	1204680	have a robot, it'll be the same thing as like not having your refrigerator or a VCR. Yeah,
1204680	1209880	like your friend's house. It's like, oh, dude, you know, your my remote has a cord on it that
1209880	1217320	goes to the TV. Mine doesn't nerd. Kids will be going over the fucking plastic doodle come out.
1217320	1224360	Hello, Steve. That's it. Why want a beer? And it'll do it all fucked up. But everybody will be like,
1224360	1229640	this robot. Does it does it does it seem is it like now that now that we've gotten to the
1229640	1235000	bottom of the pedophilia thing and how that like, like, so part of the like, like this
1235000	1241160	self destructive impulse we have, doesn't it seem like we're in a race against ourselves to create
1241880	1248360	enough technology that we can finally get mad. Like, like, aren't we like, don't we,
1248360	1255800	all the movies that we write are about how fucked up it is that computers are smarter than us and
1255800	1261800	how they're going to take over one day. But every dollar we spent, including on those movies,
1261800	1266200	but more importantly, way more than on those movies we spend on all these devices and all
1266200	1273400	these things at the like, we're really, we really want and this includes me. I you want like,
1273400	1278440	artificial intelligence to happen. Well, yeah, it's there. I just read this very creepy thought
1278440	1282840	experiment. I wish I could remember the name of it. It's somebody's Basilisk is the name of the
1282840	1287880	thought experiment. But the idea is that it's someone know this. Did you guys read this blog?
1287880	1298120	So someone said Roscoe's Basilisk. It's such a it sounds like the best country song ever.
1299080	1305080	Are you saying that into your muffled hands? Because you because you could I don't know
1305080	1310200	very much about it. I'm sorry. Okay, well, so you don't want, you don't want to come up and be the
1310200	1317720	Roscoe's Basilisk expert. I bet you bet I bet you know more about it than I do. And I
1317720	1323720	started talking about it in front of a room full of people. But what if we gave you an
1323720	1327160	out and said, you're not supposed to know about all this. And we just wanted to make a new friend.
1329320	1335800	Oh, okay. Well, all right. The thought experiment is that but if you look at the direction that
1336920	1344680	technology is going, you can see that there's a kind of inevitable birth of ascension,
1344680	1353640	super intelligent cyborg, computer AI that will be so much more advanced than us that we react to
1353640	1359240	it in the same way like dogs react to us. So you could see that that's where it's going. You know,
1359240	1364120	there's a lot of see that's where it's going. That's a lot Kurzweil, you know, he talks about
1364120	1369960	this, like a lot of like really, really smart people, they don't say it's if it might happen.
1369960	1376120	They're just like, well, there, I just watched a documentary today on Hulu, about in this
1376120	1381560	professor who's died now, but he worked at MIT. And when it was one of the first people to build
1381560	1386920	a computer. And he was talking about how exciting that was to build a computer before a computer
1386920	1395880	existed. He was saying that when you're working on a project, as a technician, you think of the end
1395880	1400680	result of the project. And you imagine that the final end result of the project, if someone gave
1400680	1406600	you a button that you could press, and the thing would never have happened, which if you would
1406600	1411400	press that button, you should never work on the project. And he was saying that in relation to
1411400	1417320	having witnessed where AI is going after his help in creating computers and recognizing that they
1417320	1423160	were going to their robots are going to turn into these super advanced military death machines. He
1423160	1428600	wished that he'd never started working on this stuff at all. So it's really creepy. When you see,
1428600	1434200	he's not saying, will these things take over the world? He's saying, I wish I hadn't been a part
1434200	1443000	of these things taking over the world. And that's creepy. So, so the bass, this broscos,
1443000	1447720	basilisk, or whatever it is, the idea is that because these things are so advanced,
1447720	1453640	and they represent a point in the future where our intelligence is so much eclipsed by these
1453640	1460760	massively advanced things, they're planning their evolution through us. And the basilisk is that
1460760	1466360	the more you help its evolution growing through you, the more you are rewarded, which is why
1466360	1473160	all these Bill Gates and Google, Twitter, and anyone involved in this connective technology
1473160	1477960	is being rewarded with massive amounts of money, because this super intelligence is sort of
1477960	1485320	operating through time and space and drawing them into its final existence. That's the thought
1485320	1491640	experiment. It's drinking in our souls. Yeah, that's it. Sorry, somebody, somebody calling out in the back.
1491640	1497480	I was saying the algorithms are learning. That's what the rest of us. But our children aren't.
1497480	1505640	Someone in the back said our algorithms are learning, which I detected a cautiousness in
1505640	1510840	her voice, and then a disgusted man in the front said, but our children are, which I think is the
1510840	1516120	two sides of the issue. It's like, fuck us as a species. Like we've, we had enough.
1516840	1524440	But there's the one mitigating issue, which is like, what if this is like, we have eyeglasses,
1524520	1530840	we have alphabets, we have clothing, we have, we have things that children are born into that are
1530840	1536120	not, they're not, we didn't modify our DNA to improve our species. We didn't, you know, kids
1536120	1541800	aren't born with less propensity for diabetes just because we figured out how to balance it
1541800	1546920	with insulin. And yet we've evolved because people whose lives we've saved, the condition of our lives
1546920	1551320	we've improved, they can continue to reproduce. So there's a, there's a, there's another factor
1551320	1556600	there. It's like as human beings, we have halted genetic evolution. So we ensure as hell better
1556600	1563240	increase mimetic evolution. We have to, for the sake of our own survival, create a different way
1563240	1568040	for us to evolve because we're so in love with ourselves and each other and such compassionate
1568040	1573320	creatures that we're certainly not going to play Darwin's game anymore on a grand enough scale
1573320	1580200	to be in the cosmos on schedule because we fuck up the planet every, you know, with every, every,
1580760	1586440	you know, man hour of work we put into the future. It's like we, it's this video game where it's like
1586440	1592520	we got to get off this thing, we think and let it heal itself at least before it kills us all.
1592520	1598280	Well, yeah, we think that's the funny thing is like we think that we're, our actions are based
1598280	1602920	on some kind of free will. But like if you've ever seen those videos of the weird fungus that
1602920	1608360	gets into the crickets and the crickets, we're definitely, yeah. How about a video of a three
1608360	1613800	year old being better at an iPad than a 40 year old? Like that's all you need to see. Like this
1613800	1618600	thing's going to, but Dan, you know, the video, you've seen the videos of the parasitic fungus
1618600	1624280	that gets into the crickets that are the ant and the ant goes into the swimming, they're drawn to
1624280	1629640	water. And the reason they're drawn to water is because the parasite inside of them explodes out
1629640	1633720	of them and likes to swim in the water. So in the same way, we're the ones that crawl up because
1633720	1638120	they want to be up top so they can rain fungus down on their side. That's it. So we all think
1638120	1643240	the way an alien comes to planet earth is the silver ship. We think the way the alien comes is
1643240	1648760	some like thing based on our technology, but maybe the alien is just a fungus. Maybe is like
1648760	1654200	the earth is spinning around the sun. It went through some kind of cosmic fungus that infected
1654200	1659320	our brains and made us think like, man, let's build a computer. That'll be a great idea. We'll
1659320	1664600	build a computer and then we'll build robots. And then as we continue to build these and you're
1664600	1667960	like, why are you building this stuff? You're like, I don't know. It's fucking cool, right?
1669320	1675880	Well, that cosmic fungus is called RNA and it's the planet that's the organism that's
1675880	1681880	being infested. So we're on the winning side. We're the fungus because we're just in a stage
1681880	1685880	of life. We make computers. Computers are our babies. We can be proud of them. They're going
1685880	1691960	to kill us, but it's part of us. I don't think they're going to kill us. I think they're going
1691960	1696680	to like treat us the way we treat dogs. Like I think the first super advanced robots are just
1696680	1702120	going to like comb our hair, massages, rub oil into it. Because we'll tell them to and we'll think
1702120	1708440	that we're like, oh man, good computer. And it's like rubbing us and it's like, wait, this is what
1708520	1716360	I do to my dog too late. Like, oh, it's protecting us and owning us and charting us. Oh, it's taking
1716360	1721000	us to a special place and weighing us and putting it. It's just making sure we don't have worms in
1721000	1729000	our ears. We have nailed this technology. Wait a minute. Well, it seems a crime to not be having
1729000	1733480	this conversation without, uh, wait, that was a lot of negative stacked up. It seems a crime to be
1733480	1747080	having this conversation without Spencer Crittenden. Sorry if I caught you by surprise.
1749320	1756280	You know, the medic evolution. Yeah. That's what I like to do in my spare time. Really? No, I don't
1756280	1762680	know. I was looking up that Basilisk thing. Uh, Bass is Basilisk or Basilisk. Yeah. That's what
1762680	1769400	is in the dragon. The lizard that turns you to stone. Yeah. Not a dragon. Come on. Oh,
1769400	1774920	is the idea that it, that, that technology will freeze us in our progress. So from what I read,
1774920	1782760	it was, it was called Rocco's Basilisk. And it said that, uh, there's essentially a hundred percent
1782760	1789000	chance or like that a super powerful AI will come into existence. And because it will,
1789000	1797160	it'll kill everyone that didn't help make it. Yes. But it presupposes that, uh, killing you
1797160	1801880	means what it means by killing you is killing a simulation of you in order to find out how to
1801880	1806760	best save you. And simulations of you are no different than you in the real world, which I
1806840	1815960	don't think follows. I don't think that makes sense. So fuck it. All right. What else have we
1815960	1825640	got going on here? Continuing our technology episode. Uh, Aaron just texted. She loves me.
1825640	1831880	What'd she say? Oh, she loves me. Not enough to be here, but she loves me. It's her friend's
1831880	1845640	birthday. Uh, the, uh, uh, animal screens, like a dog door. Nope. My dog and my cat can watch TV
1845640	1851800	with me now because it's a different frame rate or something. Adam, stop with the sarcastic, uh,
1851800	1855240	attempts. If they don't want to applaud, it means it's thoughtful.
1855240	1861960	Do you know Adam Goldberg? Yes. Okay. Hi, Adam.
1864680	1869080	Didn't they see the air conditioning I fixed in here? What's that? Yeah, they said that. Yeah.
1870520	1874520	How's that matching up with your data? Um, it doesn't feel conditioned.
1876680	1882680	You know what I just saw on Reddit, really smart AC when you're alive refrigeration when you're
1882760	1890360	dead. When you're alive, this is called air conditioning, but when you're a corpse,
1890360	1894600	they call it refrigeration, but it's essentially you're complaining about the refrigeration,
1894600	1904200	not the AC. What's a fan in that instance though? I don't know. I've never put a fan on a dead body.
1904200	1911880	It probably doesn't help. I imagine. It's more of a smell maker. Yeah. Close the smell.
1911880	1916680	Why would dead people complain about refrigeration or anything? They wouldn't.
1916680	1922440	Life people might complain about them. You know, like it's spoiled. I just want to say, I think,
1922440	1929560	look like, well, okay. So like if you're, if there's an expert in, in this group, uh,
1929560	1933000	that could speak to this, uh, we're going to bring you up because I want to, because I don't
1933000	1936680	want to just babble about this and be right. I have a bunch of people tweet me, but here's how,
1936680	1940600	here's what I understand. I'm going to dump everything in my head out into the table.
1942360	1948760	Cathode Ray tube televisions. Uh, when you film them, like sometimes there's that flicker
1948760	1951480	that fly off into your face. There's a little bit of vodka.
1954680	1960920	The, uh, the, the, the cats and dogs, when they watch those old TVs, the tube TVs,
1960920	1965560	they basically couldn't see shit on them. It would just look like when you put a video camera
1965560	1971720	on a TV, both, unless you sink to the frame rate with special equipment, you're seeing what a cat
1971720	1977720	or a dog would see, which is just like a raster beam, just nothing. Now these, uh, HD TVs,
1977720	1982040	because of the frame rate, the result, I don't know what the fuck. My dog, I, I just like sit
1982040	1987400	with my dog and I just like bring up YouTube videos of puppies and the dog just sits there,
1987400	1993800	freaks out. It tries to look behind the wall for the, for the dogs. It, it loves horses. It
1993800	1999880	loves, uh, other dogs. Then we, then Aaron took a video of the dog, put it up on the screen and the
1999880	2009720	dog had a meltdown. Also the cat, like the cat at one point, we were watching kitten videos and
2009720	2013560	the cat just started watching and it was like, this never happened. I've had cats my whole life,
2013560	2019640	but what changed is these screens. It's, they're all our little, uh, species. We all have different
2019640	2024280	models of camera in our eye and they all operate at different frame rates. And, uh, I think,
2024280	2029160	I believe that what's happened now that we're not really paying attention to is the fact that for
2029160	2035960	the first time in our lives, our pets are watching television with us, which was a joke and scrooged,
2035960	2042200	but like it's, this is, it's a real thing now. Yeah. It's very, it's really weird to think that
2042200	2047480	as we are approaching the singularity, our pets are also approaching the singularity. They might
2047480	2052360	pick up the mantle that they could become like, like, yeah, their dog would be like lifting a
2052360	2060040	torch to an old cave painting of us showing it TV. Uh, didn't you say, what would you say to me
2060040	2063720	about the Planet of the Apes thing? They were, they were going to take chimpanzees to see the
2063720	2068600	Planet of the Apes. No, no, I didn't say that, but yeah, they said, oh, that was that, was that Alex?
2068600	2074040	Yeah. He said that they brought some chimps to watch Planet of the Apes and they hated it.
2078840	2080440	They thought it had third act problems.
2086280	2092280	I don't know. It got convoluted, that story. I think it was something, but it's probably also
2092280	2097720	true. Uh, oh, oh, shit. We got to bring up. Hey, is Neil Berkeley here? Neil, are you in the back?
2097720	2113080	Come on up, Neil Berkeley. I just took my own magic trick. Uh, I'm bringing up Neil because
2113080	2117960	as some of you know, I get that jump sensation, by the way, my whole life, I've been deathly afraid
2117960	2122520	of heights. Oh yeah. Because every time I step near, go near let your dream about a high place,
2122520	2127400	I always jump off. Yeah. I don't, I float over. Something levitates me over the, I don't float.
2127400	2133320	I plummet to the concrete and then I wake up. Yeah. Wake up as I hit the concrete and no one's,
2133320	2136840	I always say, I don't want to go up there. I get a jump sensation. Everyone makes fun of you and
2136840	2140440	says, that's stupid. Why are you saying that? You're not going to jump off. But I, I, I swear to
2140440	2148360	my, how many like, what is it? Eight muscle contortions in the right combination could take
2148360	2154600	you over the railing of a fancy hotel. Like, like, like, like, have you ever gone into a,
2154600	2157240	a wedding reception and just been moved to boogie?
2160040	2166360	Are you totally in control of what's going on? Or do you just go with it? And what if,
2166360	2174280	like one misfire and you just go with the right combination? People do it in their sleep. Yeah.
2174280	2178200	I've had one panic attack my entire life and it was being in Vancouver. There's this giant
2178200	2183080	bridge that connects an island and I got halfway through and I started sprinting to the other side
2183080	2186040	because I was, so I got, I bought a pack of cigarettes and like a six pack of beer because
2186040	2189640	I was so like, it scared the shit out of me. I thought I was going to jump off the side.
2189640	2195800	The, the cigarettes and the beer were to show the bridge that you were just there to shop.
2197560	2201160	To calm down. I was, I was so, I was shaking. I was so freaked out. I thought I was having a
2201160	2206360	heart attack. Well, you know, there, there's a very spooky thing where they've been trying
2206360	2212440	to understand where free will is in the brain. And it seems like an action is determined
2213000	2218680	a few milliseconds before you decide to make the action. Yes. So that's really creepy to think
2218680	2224840	that if you're at the edge of a building, your brain is just like, you know what? Let's get,
2224840	2230600	let's get out of this dimension. This fucking sucks. And then you're like, my mom molested me.
2236360	2243960	It took this bridge to make me realize it. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm burping. It's my cheat days. I've
2243960	2249320	been drinking beer instead of vodka today. You may have noticed a lighter tone to the show.
2253640	2261800	Something with better taste, perhaps a little less filling. And only 64 calories. So Neil,
2262200	2268680	you directed a movie about me and what a bad person I am and how I went out in the road and
2268680	2273480	continued to be a bad person and failed to ever become a good person. Harmontown. Yes.
2275160	2280040	And people are scrambling to see it and the reviews are good. Reviews have been good. People
2280040	2284040	and crowds have loved it. What's crazy though is the first time we shot here, we had a tripod
2284600	2288120	halfway through this room with no one in the back and now it would block like a hundred people.
2288680	2291400	Um, yeah, don't credit yourself. It's the Yahoo deal. No,
2293000	2300520	I just, I just want to make sure it's not, okay. It's always what I do. Thank you. Thank you.
2300520	2307480	Congratulations to your movie. Uh, I never know. I know it's the summer and their college kids.
2307480	2313800	It's like the, the, the summer it fills up like a heart and then fall. They flushes them out into
2313800	2317160	the world with all kinds of bad thoughts about how to live their lives.
2319000	2323560	Suck it in, push it out. They all flood to the rest of the country and ruin it.
2328200	2331640	In a good way. So we can go to the moon and, uh, the, uh,
2334040	2338680	it got bought by the orchard company. Talk about that. Yes. The orchard is this company that, uh,
2338680	2343800	called us up and said they want to put the movie out. So on September 26th here in Los Angeles,
2343800	2348440	the world will get to see the movie where it's going to be at Senna family. Uh, and then,
2349960	2354440	and then many, many theaters after that. And no, we're going to do a day and day thing. So on the
2354440	2359400	very day it comes out in theaters, it'll be on the internet. So go to harmontown.com and, uh,
2359400	2362440	sign up for mailing lists. We're going to do a pre-order where you can get that and a bunch
2362440	2366760	of other cool stuff. Uh, but yeah, it's happening. The movie's finally coming out. I know it took a
2366760	2373880	little while. I apologize for that. Not your fault. Probably mine. Uh, maybe if I had had a
2373880	2380600	three act story in my behavior, I didn't come here tonight to do the planning on doing this.
2380600	2383960	I knew you were going to announce it, but I'm glad I'm here because I don't, I don't people
2383960	2388520	realize how little we knew each other when we first talked about doing this movie. Um,
2388520	2393560	and you asked me to the day, I still don't know you a little bit.
2393960	2401480	I don't know. Fish for crawdads and had a similar upbringing. Uh, maybe. Um,
2402360	2407720	but, uh, no, you asked me the day if it was, if it was, uh, different than my first experience.
2407720	2413000	Oh yeah. And, and I, I will say yes, it's, it's much bigger. There's more people and I'm really,
2413000	2416680	really proud of this movie. I think it's a really good movie, not just for the people in this room
2416680	2422520	or people that know Dan. I think people can get something out of it. And, uh, I, I, I want to say
2422520	2426360	thank you for letting me do it. I don't know if I've ever said that cause I'm not good at like
2426360	2432360	gratitude or emotions, but I do want to say thank you for letting me do it and trusting, uh, honesty
2432360	2437080	and letting me do, cause I know there were ups and downs and low points and even the making of the,
2437080	2441080	of the finishing of the movie, but, uh, thank you so much. Well, my motive was, uh,
2444920	2449320	my motive was all narcissism and also I could profit if the movie's good, but while, while,
2449320	2453400	while you're at it, it's a good time. It hadn't occurred to me. I, uh, everyone listening to the
2453400	2457320	podcast right now, so many of them came out to all the cities when you're making the movie. And the
2457320	2463160	big thing about the movie that really sticks a knife in your rib cage is inexplicably, almost
2463160	2470120	inexplicably, uh, just images of faces. And it's just like interviews with every fan who, you know,
2470120	2475320	harm in town fans that showed up for all these shows there, they lay themselves bare on camera
2475320	2481080	for no money. They sign a release form and that, you know, they flooded their humanity into your
2481080	2485720	movie. If it was just about me trying to figure out where my, where I put my red solo cup down,
2487560	2493480	not, not such a, not such a heart string puller. Uh, but, uh, so thank you to all of you guys in,
2493480	2499720	in Brooklyn and Austin and Phoenix and fucking, uh, 140 people, we interviewed 140 harmontown
2499720	2504920	fans around and a bunch of them right back there in the green room. Uh, you know, yeah, they, I love,
2504920	2508600	when I first came to the show, I was like, man, there's something going on here. Let's,
2508600	2512360	let's explain why these people are in this room. Let's talk about that and let's have them tell us.
2512360	2517800	So yeah, you were driven by your unanswerable question. Why do these people like Dan Harmon?
2519240	2525960	As you so flagrantly, uh, discussed in the, in the media before, as you introduce the movie,
2525960	2530680	every time, every screening I'm at, you go, I wanted to know why they liked him.
2530920	2537320	I couldn't, I couldn't figure it out, but in the process, I discovered some wonderful people
2540440	2543080	set against the backdrop of an asshole. Enjoy.
2545320	2551640	My next movie will hopefully be about someone that I can understand why people like them. Uh,
2551640	2556600	yeah, I'm, uh, I'm doing my bit where I play the victim. I'm cha-ching. This movie's going to be
2556600	2562840	great. Uh, anything else? No, that's it. Thank you. All right. Neil, thank you.
2569560	2575480	What a show. What a show. Who needs Jeff Davis? Who needs Jeff Davis? Not me. That's for sure.
2577160	2578840	It's great. So you guys,
2578840	2585000	I'm really, I'm really hesitant to enter this segment of the show,
2585560	2588600	but you guys were talking to me about magic, the gathering early.
2592600	2600920	Yeah. I, I recently started playing. I, I took a, probably a 15, at least a 15 year
2601880	2607800	40, 20. I spent a long time not playing magic, the gathering.
2609560	2615640	But I, when I, when I was much younger, I used to play it all the time. I had one of those like
2615640	2621800	white boxes, one of those white rectangular boxes with your cards organized according to color.
2621800	2627240	It was so fun. I would play it all the time. I was so deeply addicted to it.
2627240	2634200	It mixes so well with LSD and any kind of like it does. It's like a very psychedelic game. It's
2634200	2641560	really fun and dark evil. It's an evil game. You feel like, am I wrong that it seems evil when you
2641560	2650760	play it? It seemed evil. It makes you fight with your dearest friend. You think about, yeah,
2650760	2656280	so a lot of games are like that. They're like catchphrase. I feel that way. I called my mom,
2656280	2666600	the C word playing catchphrase. No magic. I think that I seriously did. It was, they came to visit
2666600	2670680	LA and they just met Aaron for the first time. And Aaron's like, let's play catchphrase. And I'm
2670680	2675080	like getting my mom to try to say a word. And I'm like, no, it's a fucking, it's a yellow guy.
2675080	2679160	He eats dots. He's got a mouth. He lives in a world that's named after him. It's from the 80s.
2679640	2690520	And then it beeps and I was like, you fucking. And then just silence over the room. And then my mom
2690520	2698040	was like, Aaron was like, I don't know what I'm experiencing. And my mom was like, he's just
2698040	2707400	frustrated. No, I, you know, I, I grew, I went to high school and junior high school and the Bible
2707400	2714440	belt. So like, I got to have like some serious Christian indoctrination and there's something
2715240	2721960	fun when you're playing magic where it does feel like if there were Satanists in the world
2722760	2729080	and they wanted to infect the world with some dark thing, it would be magic to gather.
2730040	2735640	It's fun to play and imagine you're falling into the spell of some diabolic thing, but it really
2735640	2740280	is like, you know, it's like when you listen to bursum, if you ever listen to bursum,
2741000	2747000	you know, bursum is he's like, what's cool about bursum is, I think that's the street
2747000	2754600	that my Uber driver thought he was taking me to. No bursum Norwegian death metal.
2755480	2761960	He really killed people. He's like, not just like heavy metal. He's actually a murderer. Like in the,
2761960	2767320	in the same way that like when you're listening to NWA, you get to fantasize like they really
2767320	2775560	kill people. Like these are murderers rapping. Bursum is like a Norwegian death metal artist who
2775560	2782440	I think sell me out of here. Didn't even have no idea. Thank you. He killed his fucking drummer.
2783560	2789960	That's a true musician. Like when you're listening to him, you're like, this is an
2789960	2797960	actual rock and roll master. So, so, so when you buy his second CD, it's just, there's no drums
2797960	2803480	and it's just these brilliant songs, literally insight into a man who needed to work alone.
2804120	2814360	I needed space. Sorry if the rhythm isn't kept. I needed space. The constant banging drove me nuts.
2814360	2823080	I'm, are you aware of how cool Norwegian death metal is? Do you know about this at all?
2823080	2827000	Well, I know it's black metal. Do you know anything about it? When I was, when I was 15,
2827000	2834200	I was really into this band Manowar. Uh, is that, is that, I don't know what country they're from,
2834200	2839640	but they were like, yeah, the, the, the cool thing about, I mean, I've shared Norway. Yeah.
2839640	2843640	There was just, there was this thing, I guess it's still a thing. The, the, actually the
2843640	2852040	scorpions were, they were, you know, not the scorpions. English was their second language,
2852040	2858360	right? These were Satanists who were not just like content with being like Satanists. They were
2858360	2866120	roaming through Europe, setting churches on fire. Like they were, I'm sorry. I just want to clarify.
2866120	2870200	I was drawing a larger point, a cultural point where it's like America creates this
2870200	2875640	silly thing called that's largely like driven by capitalism, which is like, we're, we're heavy
2875640	2883000	metal. And then the songs are like, you go to rock. You got to rock so hard. I don't care if
2883000	2888920	you don't rock hard. Don't talk to me cause I'm going to cut your head off. And then, and then
2888920	2894760	it gets exported to foreign countries. And it's like this adorable, amazing thing happens where
2895400	2902760	European or East European, like heavy metal bands, they're like, they take us at face value. They're
2902760	2909400	like, we heard, we heard the importance of metal and we believe it. And they, they make metal more
2909400	2915320	important. They're way more metal than any American metal band ever. There's like a million of these
2915320	2919640	bands. That's what I was saying. The scorpions were kind of like that. I seriously say, yeah,
2919640	2925320	like it infected, it infected Norway somehow and they became evil, but I don't think that's what
2925320	2931960	happened. I think that a dark energy rose up from the ground and possessed these people. And like
2931960	2940200	one, it's true, they're fucked up, man. Like what, like the, the cover of one of their albums is from
2940200	2946200	one of them walk coming home and like want their guitarist or one of the musicians has blown his
2946280	2951480	brains out in the house. And they're like, Oh, this is the great, this is the next album cover.
2951480	2957880	Let's take a picture of this. And then I'm talking about, he took, they took one of the skull
2957880	2964280	fragments from his brain, from his like just blasted head and like he would wear it on stage
2964280	2972120	as a necklace when he was playing. That's rock and roll friend. It's metal. It's metal. It's pretty
2972120	2978920	dark. It's pretty dark. So in the same way, when you're playing magic together, you feel that
2978920	2986440	potential. You feel like if you came home from work and your girlfriend had chilled herself,
2986440	2994280	that you might make a new card out of her blood. I haven't played it. I've played, now what I've
2994280	3001720	played like apps like on the iPad that simulate these games that were being invented when I was
3002520	3009160	a tyke. The reason why I have, I don't, I don't, I don't get it is because when I was a kid,
3009160	3014760	there was actual role playing, which was a big deal. You get your graph paper and your pencils
3014760	3021400	and everything's gritty. And it was the nerds version of fucking gangster culture. It was like,
3021400	3026280	you're not supposed to understand it. Fuck, it's supposed to intimidate you. It's supposed to feel
3026280	3030920	dense and impenetrable. If anyone looks over your shoulder while you're drawing something,
3030920	3036840	you're supposed to go like, you psycho. Yeah, that's right, motherfucker. Because that's my,
3036840	3042200	I'm designing a spell. And it's level three, you know, and it's like, I'm researching dungeons and
3042200	3049240	the text is like so tiny. You can't read it with eyes younger than 15. And it just like, just like,
3049240	3055240	it was just like, it was the heyday. It was like the internet was barely existent. And I just like,
3055240	3062680	I would go to gym class and sit in a corner and close my eyes and meditate about dungeons. And
3062680	3068600	every once in a while a ball would hit me in the head. And but it was worth it because the gym
3068600	3075160	teacher was like, all right, see. Because if I give you an F, then I got to figure out how to fix you.
3076920	3084840	See, get out of here. You're weird. You sit in the corner and get hit in the head with a ball. Maybe
3084840	3091560	that'll be a sport one day. The the the grittiness and those are the cards. It's like to me, I'm 41.
3091560	3102040	I'm like cards. Man, fuck that shit. That's when my little tiny voice comes out. I say fuck it.
3102760	3107480	We got to get past it, man. Yeah, you have to because it's it's well because since then I've
3107480	3113000	become addicted to iPad games where I'm a waitress waiting tables. You'd think I would
3113560	3119640	like be less of a snob about how I spend my time. What here's the here's one thing people don't
3119640	3126200	realize about Magic the Gathering. And the fact that I've said that in my life means that I should
3126200	3132920	move out of the country and become a monk to Norway. Maybe so. But what one thing that you
3132920	3139160	that's that's interesting about the game is you can really express yourself through the deck you
3139240	3146360	construct and the cards that you play you can really create a deck that is so vicious and
3146360	3154760	cunty and awful that it's actually evil. Like you can really create evil. Like you have I have but
3154760	3160280	it's I have gotten in the worst fights of my life with my girlfriend. But it's expressed through
3160280	3165880	and through this card beats this card or this card doesn't. Yeah, but you picked the cards.
3166520	3173640	You decided that you wanted this deck to slowly remove your opponent's cards to slowly like
3173640	3181000	disintegrate your opponent's hopes to like create like bad bad results that involve argument after
3181000	3187640	argument. You made that thing like you brought that darkness into the world. It's really fun.
3187640	3193560	You can't do that with other games. It's like 100 times worse than Monopoly like any
3194120	3201320	yeah. Monopoly fight you've gotten in it pales. This is like this is the musket versus Hiroshima
3201320	3211400	compared to like how awful this game is. It's great. So all right. I don't think I've ever
3211400	3216280	gotten in a real like argument with someone playing magic. Then you don't care about magic.
3218040	3222120	No, you just know the rules like when you don't understand the rules. That's where the fights
3222120	3229640	happen. It's a cool game though. It's like 12 angry men when I'm playing because here it's like
3229640	3236520	I don't know the rules enough. So it just comes down to like am I able to like argue well enough
3236520	3242840	that they accept the rules like I'm I've been wrong several times when you google it. It's like
3242840	3247960	just I've been completely wrong about the way it works. But it's a complicated game. You do need
3248360	3254200	someone there to mediate the rules because it is very complicated. It's tough. All right.
3255320	3261000	It's 9 11. So it's time to bring up one of my writers Alex Rubens.
3266040	3270040	In anticipation of having to play D&D we need
3271000	3281720	manpower. Hi. How are you? Hi. So we work today on your draft of Rick and Morty. Yep.
3283560	3290840	Look at these guys. They love it. They harmonized it. Yeah. Do you enjoy working for me?
3291720	3295960	Yeah. Yeah. Very very much. It seems like it must be magical.
3296440	3301720	When like a week into working with you on community you brought me up on stage here
3301720	3306680	and I was very uncomfortable. Yeah. But I think it's because I get I get in my head in a way that's
3306680	3311080	that occasionally like the dogs looking at the frame rate on the TV where it is perfectly
3311080	3317800	incompatible with your head. Because I'm a shimmering beacon of writing knowledge. Yeah.
3317800	3322200	Even though you went to way more college than me. Yeah. So this is how I get my revenge.
3322920	3329320	Everybody that's good that got good grades in gym. Everybody that went to Harvard. Everybody
3329320	3337640	that everybody they're all beneath me. Yeah. They all work for me. The problem that I always
3337640	3346680	have when talking to you in a public forum or is that the candor that you bring to a situation
3346680	3351560	like this makes me feel like I should speak my mind in this like completely fluid way. What do
3351560	3356280	you think the worst thing that would happen would be if you did that. I know exactly what it what it
3356280	3361560	is because because it there's a conflict of interest and the conflict of interest is that
3361560	3371800	I care about how I look. No I don't. No I see. I understand how you read that. That's a heroic
3371800	3378280	fashion. No I care. I care about how I look. And I'm and I'm a big I'm a big Harmon fan. So speaking
3378280	3385000	candidly about that makes me seem like a kiss ass because you're my boss. Right. I mean like
3385000	3389160	literally you're my boss. But what's the most shameful thing you've ever done in your life.
3392200	3397880	Or you're fired. I was just talking to my wife.
3400840	3407080	My my wife had this very embarrassing experience just recently and was and then wanted afterwards
3407080	3411880	to like bond about like she's like let's talk about the most humiliating things that have ever
3411880	3415400	happened to us like once when I was in seventh grade this happened and I started getting all
3415400	3420520	stressed out and I couldn't figure out why and then I realized that I got to I mean this is a
3420520	3426280	sad story. But you know in I may have told you this already but you know in the Avengers the movie
3426840	3433880	when Bruce Banner explains that his secret with have you seen it Duncan. No I haven't seen that.
3433880	3440120	I haven't either. God damn. All right. Well you know you know that Bruce Banner turns in the Hulk
3440120	3443720	when he gets angry. Yeah. And he can't control it. Yeah. And it's this running thing throughout
3443720	3446840	the movie that he's like now I figured out how to control it. And they're like what's your secret.
3446840	3452440	And he's like I'll tell you later. And then when he tells you and drink. Oh thanks man. Thank you.
3453080	3457960	He he finally tells them that like just as he's about to turn into the Hulk and punch some
3457960	3463320	enormous like space worm. He's like I never told you my secret. It's that I'm always angry. And
3463400	3480520	then he turns into the hole. I saw the Avengers. Well that's that's how I am. But instead of with
3480520	3486840	anger it's with humiliation and shame. Meaning that you feel humiliation shame or meaning that
3487160	3494120	you had readily spout out something incredibly. No it's that I think in some ways I'm actually
3494120	3499240	relatively immune to shame. Like I was having trouble thinking of times I've been embarrassed
3499240	3504760	but then I realized that at a certain point in my life the embarrassment flooded over me so
3504760	3509800	completely that I lived in the universe of embarrassment and that became the background
3509800	3515560	and then no new embarrassment could penetrate. Yeah. And it became a game of making sure that
3515560	3520760	anybody that comes near you knows that they're an embarrassment town. Well that's how I started
3520760	3526200	to think of it. It's like Paul who goes there. You don't have to put your gun down but you know
3526200	3533240	you better know I shit my parents when I was three because I don't want you making fun of me.
3534360	3539640	If you do you'll be hacked because I did it first. Right. Well yeah. Well that's my that's my worst.
3539640	3545000	That's where I'm the craziest is that I have to. I'm so I'm like Ruth. There's a lyric in
3545320	3549320	I think enough Montreal song that he was like if I did to anyone else what I do to myself I would
3549320	3553400	be in jail for something like that. And that's how I feel because I'm so mean to myself and it's
3553400	3558360	because if anyone in this room could say something mean about me that I haven't already thought of I
3558360	3563160	would die. Yeah exactly. So I have to be. Yeah. You've got to shoot me through a hole I already
3563160	3567320	created or it's going to hurt bad. There are certain things I hope that you don't notice about
3567320	3571640	me but if you do I'll be like fuck they figured it out. I got it. I was on Reddit once and there
3571640	3578680	was some guy people were having a conversation about me because they do that. And and this was
3578680	3583800	like back before I like I just got away from Reddit. Not because it's bad because it's great
3583800	3588440	and I can't I can't have no experience. But but like there was some conversation in Reddit that
3588440	3591480	was going to somebody you know they're talking about me and they don't know I'm listening. They
3591480	3595160	don't want me to be listening. They want to talk about me as if I'm like you know it's like a part
3595160	3599000	of this show that they're they're just talking casually about it. They got 900 things in their
3599000	3604520	lives. But I'm reading it and I'm fucking like what do people think about me. And and somebody
3604520	3611320	was like yeah well as long as he doesn't have another alcoholic meltdown. And I like signed
3611320	3622440	in and it was like citations needed. Citations needed. And I kept on and there was on this
3622440	3626920	Jag was like I was like scouring these threads and I was like any time it was like just Wikipedia
3626920	3632280	like what if it's a fucking citation. What are you talking about. And then the funny thing that
3632280	3641880	would happen is when I would do that people go oh well Mr. Harmon. Yes well yeah here's my citation.
3641880	3648920	And it was a valid one. It was a quote from me in like Wired magazine. Yeah I had an alcoholic
3648920	3654280	meltdown or it's like whatever. It would always be me. And the weird thing is like I had this thing
3654280	3660200	I was like I had this emotional response that it was like when that would come up and they would
3660200	3663400	go no I'm getting that from the Hollywood Reporter and they said this now you did this interview.
3664360	3672280	And then I would go for one of them I responded you know with what was the honest epiphany that
3672280	3678600	I had which was oh good I just really need to know that I'm the person spreading bad news about me.
3678840	3686920	Oh yeah. I just really needed to be me. Wasn't it you who was just was it. Sorry I think it was you
3686920	3693320	just saying this like today. It was a long day. I don't repeat myself. No what what are you doing.
3693320	3696440	I'm really embarrassed that my apparently my brain doesn't work anymore because I think this
3696440	3702120	is you talking about how you don't want to be. No no I think it's my friend Raza. He was talking
3702120	3708200	about who he doesn't want to be murdered by. Well he was saying he'd much rather. Who's fucking
3708200	3714360	saying. Oh my friend Kevin. The rest of this the rest of everything I say is going to be me trying
3714360	3720040	to figure out who said this. No he was saying that like he doesn't care if he he'd rather it was
3720040	3726840	roller. It was not roller. It was 100 percent mad roller 100 percent sure. He was saying if he got
3726840	3734760	murdered he would rather that the person be an idiot who just happened to murder him then that
3734760	3741240	it be a genius who he's like I don't want to be part of somebody's plan. He was like and he was
3741240	3744920	and I was like oh so you don't want to feel bested like you don't want to like open your safe and
3744920	3749640	there's a bomb in there and you're like fuck and then it blows up. But he was like no but he's like
3749640	3756520	also though I don't want there to be people shooting in a bank so that they can rob the
3756520	3761320	museum and I get killed in the bank. Right. He doesn't want to be insignificant. He doesn't want
3761320	3765480	to be a pawn. Yeah yeah. That's so fucking fascinating. Isn't that interesting. And so
3765480	3770520	uncharacteristically honest for roller. That's amazing. Well roller is fascinating. Yeah. I love
3770520	3775880	that idea though. I love that idea of the accidental murder versus the intentional murder
3775880	3780840	because it's like to get back to the point of the show which is the conflict between Israel and
3780840	3794760	Palestine. Which by the way I hear is simmering up. It's simmering up Fred. But it is interesting
3794760	3802680	how their defenses when Hamas attacks Israel and they want to kill people it's an intentional thing
3802680	3808280	like when they kill kids as suicide bombers wandered into a cafe and has looked around and
3808280	3812760	been like all right there's like 15 kids here. Let's let's do it. We're going to explode everybody
3812760	3818840	around me. But when Israel kills kids it's like that was a fucking accident man. We didn't mean
3818840	3825720	to do it. And somehow the accidental nature makes what they're doing less severe than the intentional
3825720	3832120	nature. But it's really kind of even worse. Like if you're like a clumsy being wandering through
3832200	3838600	the world by constantly killing kids that's fucked up. If like Israel was some giant that's
3838600	3846920	like I don't mean to do it but the kids just keep dying. That's a fucked up giant. That's like you
3846920	3853880	should stop walking around man. In this in that harmonium spirit of candor I was just talking to
3853880	3859480	my friend Raza who I mentioned earlier and this was Raza about how I have complete I now I'm not
3859480	3866760	I'm I'm a Jewish person who's not super in love with Israel. I think Israel's anyway but we can edit
3866760	3871080	that out later if you want. No no no it's fine but no well the reason that maybe you should edit it out
3871080	3876600	is that as I learned in my more provocative days when I used to get an argument with everybody
3876600	3884840	it's an extremely like controversial like people feel very strongly you've never encountered
3884840	3890600	anything like it ever before in your life. It's yeah it's I mean I and because of that I've
3890600	3896120	gone to a place where I'm like I'm out. Yeah me too. I'm not I'm not even reading the news about it
3896120	3903560	because and to be and and and that fucking riddles me with guilt because I'm like I said I'm out
3903560	3907000	and I don't even know I don't even know what's going on. There's this guy who tweeted something. I
3907000	3913320	got out because I was involved. Well you know I got I got out because because because it might
3913320	3917560	somehow splash on me which is the worst reason to get out. That's terrible but you can't do that.
3917560	3923160	You know I tweeted uh I tweeted this dumb like simple thing about how you shouldn't kill kids
3923160	3928520	and pretty soon somebody said it was just a it wasn't like it wasn't based on any geography
3928520	3934760	or religion. It was just like you know too bad like in the uh 10 commandments they didn't say
3934760	3940440	you shouldn't kill kids. That was the tweet and somebody really quickly was like why do you hate
3940440	3947720	Israel? Yeah well it's just very revealing in itself. That's fucked up. That's really dark that
3947720	3953000	that's like the Israel is if you say don't kill kids people are like man you must hate the Jews.
3953000	3958200	Something happened in the you know NBC had this reporter and he was out with reporters and he was
3958200	3963320	he saw these kids and a bomb fell on these kids and blew him up. The guy was real close and then
3963320	3969480	he was talking about it on the news like one might if they saw a bunch of kids explode 20 feet away
3969560	3976120	and he got pulled by his uh company out of the industry. It's insane if you saw that happen
3976120	3981000	wouldn't you talk about it? But you know yes you have to. I don't feel like that's a political stance.
3981000	3985240	I got this theory I think I tweeted this and Spencer favorited it that like nine out of nine
3985240	3989160	out of ten times when when there's passionate disagreement I think people are having two
3989160	3994040	different conversations and I think that people who would be outraged by what we're saying and
3994040	3999720	be like oh shit they're Nazis. Their attitude would be their like I mean this is not my attitude
3999720	4006280	by the way but I think their attitude would be like the way we would feel if like a child murderer
4007080	4012520	like was gonna murder a child and then got yelled at by the cops and was like cops man they're
4012520	4018360	always fucking like telling you what to do and you're like yes but you're a child murderer and
4018440	4023800	from the perspective of the hardcore israel people which again I am not I think they're like
4024360	4031080	you cannot criticize israel you cannot and it's because if you do holocaust 2.
4031080	4035720	I'll give the it's a slippery slope yeah and that's part of what drives me nuts about it.
4035720	4039880	Let's all hold let's all hold people to a higher standard and blah blah blah blah and they're like
4039880	4046680	we've been through this motherfucker and it's very very passionate shit. I can defend is I
4046680	4052600	read a great article defending what they're doing and and and uh that that the argument is this
4052600	4059800	the idea is that uh so their argument is here we are this peaceful place and there are these
4059800	4065880	terrorists who keep shooting missiles into our country. That sounds good. And we have this like
4065880	4071240	advanced missile shield but every one of the missiles we use to shoot down their missiles is
4071240	4076600	like fifty or a hundred thousand dollars. It's very expensive sure no one's dying over here
4076600	4082040	but if we didn't have this missile missile shield all of our many many people would be dying so
4082040	4088760	there are their argument is this Hamas terrorist organization that has said its number one goal is
4088760	4097560	the complete destruction of israel and their strategy is to um to uh make it so that their
4097560	4103880	weapons stores are placed underneath hospitals underneath like family the homes of families
4103880	4109560	so that if israel tries to get rid of their weapons they end up killing kids and then that
4109560	4115480	makes the world turn against israel. So israel is saying don't you get it? Hamas is or is like
4115480	4120600	orchestrating this entire situation so that it looks like we're killing kids when really
4120600	4125800	all we're trying to do is get rid of weapons whereas the palestinians argument is actually
4125800	4132520	we're we're stuck in this shitty shitty situation where we can't leave when we want to leave
4133080	4140360	we there there's people in palestine who watch disney movies and nickelodeon and they just want
4140360	4145880	to have a normal life but because there's it's like basically if you lived in atwater village
4145880	4151880	and and like somebody and and you were at war with hollywood and there were like people in
4151880	4156840	atwater village who would launch missiles into hollywood and every time that happened hollywood
4156840	4163320	would fly over and blow up half of atwater village that's the situation it's a really dark
4163320	4169080	shitty shitty place i just think that the where you have to land and all the complication is
4169080	4173800	just don't kill babies like if you can avoid killing babies i would agree with don't kill
4173800	4179320	babies that's it like that's the inarguable thing right except if the conversation is about abortion
4180040	4188840	well no like yeah in that case obviously let your freak flag fly yeah i i have a weird conundrum
4188840	4194040	because i'm going out tonight i i don't want to steer the conversation or were you going to talk
4194040	4199080	about this same situation you know i was gonna i was gonna try to put a little ribbon on it which
4199080	4204120	is a brilliant idea for me i'm gonna put a ribbon on the on the fucking middle east conflict
4205000	4208760	you know it's a weird situation i don't know you know there's no right answer but
4209480	4215320	this is the worst um i have a similar conundrum that's like okay it's always been weighing on me
4215320	4220840	and i keep asking people about it it's very similar it's not similar but um if you walk
4220840	4228040	into a bathroom and you saw cupcakes like would you eat them where where are they what do you
4228040	4233400	mean if you saw cupcakes like uh they're they're on that counter thing that the sink song probably
4233880	4239720	in a plastic uh you know case that's closed uh they're in a plastic case but it's not closed
4239720	4246200	what drugs are you on no no i don't i don't want to metagame but are the cupcakes gaza
4249480	4255400	it's not really i guess not very much like that conundrum but it's been burning within my heart
4255400	4258920	wait well no we'll continue with this thought experiment well that's it that's i mean what did
4259000	4263080	you guys do you guys are asking more questions would you would you eat them
4265640	4269000	no i would i would not eat cupcakes that i found in a bathroom what about you guys
4272200	4276920	you couldn't tell they look really well made wait are we playing dungeons and dragons right now
4280120	4285480	no this is just i don't know i used to be super germaphobic and OCD and i mostly conquered it
4285480	4290280	and and and it's a nice bathroom though well but but i realized part of the reason i conquered it
4290280	4294280	is i realized it was irrational and and it was one day i'm really proud of the story i'm bragging
4294280	4298920	right now i saw a quarter on the ground in new york city and i was like i shouldn't pick it up
4298920	4303160	because who knows it could have been like it could have been in shit or piss or you know but then i
4303160	4309080	was like the difference between that quarter and the quarters in my pocket right is that i know
4309080	4313160	that one was on the floor and then i'm like if i pick this quarter up right now and put it in
4313160	4318200	my pocket and mixed in with the other quarters i wouldn't know which was which and i'm like it's
4318200	4322760	all you know so that the with the cupcakes no i i wouldn't eat them in the bathroom what if you had
4322760	4334440	a sack of cupcakes already and you didn't know where they were from well my i'm gonna take my
4334440	4341160	serious answer to your question is that intellectually i feel that i should be
4341160	4347480	willing to eat the cupcakes and i wish i would but i'm probably too neurotic okay good what about
4347480	4355240	you duck i wouldn't eat the cupcakes i would that's i wish i was that kind of i wish i were you
4355240	4361560	because i think that i realized being an actualized being an alan watts level rom-dos type being would
4361560	4365640	be like i'm eating the cupcakes did spencer say he would eat the cupcakes yeah i think that like
4365640	4371240	an awakened being i think christ would eat the cupcakes but why wouldn't he is he hungry
4373560	4378120	well what's the worst case scenario right you die cyanide that's though yeah exactly
4378120	4385080	that's awesome you got killed because you ate a cupcake bathroom right like then let's let's step
4385080	4389240	it up from there you get really sick you almost die you have to spend a lot of money like that's
4389240	4394280	an insane story you can make a kickstarter off of that like right you know getting better that's
4394280	4400520	you're sick that's still an awesome story like every part of this equation is great nancy grace
4400520	4409000	would squirt if she found out that somebody died from cupcake poisoning she would never stop talking
4409000	4416360	about the death cupcakes that they placed in the bar this this does in a weird way loop back around
4416360	4421480	to your disturbing pedophilia conversation from earlier and that the original question was has
4421480	4427080	society changed or have we just gotten more hysterical about it and as speaking as a former
4427080	4431960	germaphobe recovered germaphobe one of the things i realized also is that where do you draw the line
4431960	4439160	there's the illusion of security this this also 9 11 helped with this uh but um uh but but i i used
4439160	4444440	helped with the illusion or no no helped with uh recognizing that it is an illusion i in a public
4444440	4448520	restroom used to be and this is still sort of true if there's no paper towel that i can open
4448520	4452680	the door with i'm like okay how often are they cleaning the fucking door handle in the bathroom
4452680	4457320	you open the door with a paper towel yeah what i'll tell you why i'll tell you why wait how
4457320	4462280	many smart i'll tell you why wow i'll tell you why you're the guys you're right every once in a
4462280	4466680	while i go to the back here's the funny thing when i exit a bathroom and there's like a little
4466680	4471720	wad of paper towel wrapped around the oh that's not me that's not me that's fucking gross that's
4471720	4478040	not me and that's what doesn't do with germs no well but i think i think i'm wrong and the reason
4478040	4484200	i think i'm wrong and all of you people who clapped in here wrong is that is that the logic
4484200	4488760	is okay i don't touch the the the flusher and then i wash my hands and then i touch a thing
4488760	4492360	that people who didn't wash their hands touched with their ass hands and i'm like why did i even
4492360	4497800	bother washing my hands but then i'm like i walk out and i shake people's hands and they didn't
4497800	4501960	wash their hands the world and it's open air that's that was it confused me like i love i
4501960	4506760	wish i was howard hughs and i want i i fantasize about having that germophobia because i'm like oh
4506760	4512760	that must make you a genius uh but i did it just doesn't hold up to my logic like like like he's
4512760	4517400	washing his hands and it's like give me a break i just was looking at old i i this is crazy too
4517400	4521960	but i saved my twitter favorites from like years ago and i was looking at old twitter favorites
4521960	4526520	from like 2010 and 2011 and i saw one from you that i had favorited and you said something like
4526520	4531240	um uh like like like you could never be grossed out by a public restroom because you have the
4531240	4536280	luxury of being disgusting yourself or something it was something like that i thought it was well
4536520	4541080	i'm saying it wrong so yeah i well i don't know i could i mean to me a public restroom
4541080	4547960	is the the value of it is so much higher which is no matter what's going on in your life like
4547960	4556040	if you if you go into a public restroom and pull your pants down and sit like no one including
4556040	4563320	almost god is allowed to tell you that you're supposed to be doing anything else like you can
4563320	4569000	almost like it's like like like i'm uncomfortable here i i just i don't like this bar it's too loud
4569000	4573640	i blah blah blah as long as they have a place where you can you can go and just go through
4573640	4579160	the motions of pooping then that's like you can just reset before it overwhelms you
4580440	4585240	and and and the idea of being afraid of germs and taking that away from my life is like
4585240	4591080	like the the value add is not good like kill me by germ then like well i think you're right
4591080	4594760	because the the odds that you're actually something's gonna i had a shrink who wants to
4594760	4598040	ask me he's like what are you what are you exactly afraid of catching from a door handle
4598040	4603560	in the bathroom and i was like uh diseases and he's like no well what diseases i'm like i don't
4603560	4610360	know i mean like like and i realize it's not even that i have a german mind i'm just sort of like
4610360	4616120	there might be stuff well you know what's worse man you've heard that the studies they've done
4616120	4623160	about the ice inside the ice machines and rise like there's like there's so much shit somehow
4623160	4629800	in those machines like they're it's weird because they say there's more shit inside an ice machine
4629800	4635160	at a mcdonald there isn't a toilet seat well on a toilet seat there's nothing there's nothing on
4635160	4639320	a toilet yeah but somehow how does it get into the ice machine at mcdonald's it's on your fucking
4639320	4643320	hands because you wipe your ass there's shit on your hands shit shit doesn't work in church
4643320	4649640	you don't wipe your ass with a mcdonald's ice machine like where is the now where we
4649640	4655240	there's no shit on the toilet seats how's it getting into the machine like where's the
4655240	4660040	is our hands are what we use to manipulate the world they are the shoes of our bodies
4662760	4668120	if if we're gonna love each other and we're gonna hold hands and forgive each other and hug each
4668120	4672760	other and shake hands and feed each other things and and make each other food we're gonna have to
4672760	4677720	accept that we're eating each other's shit and that's not that's not like it's like a certain
4677720	4682840	amount of that stuff will make you sick i mean step one of the quarters thing you know that my
4682840	4686680	recovery step one was that quarter and step two was being like every once in a while people will
4686680	4691320	be like you know that every time you have eaten shit in a restaurant everywhere and spiders and
4691320	4695000	bugs and everything and usually when you tell people that their reaction is like oh no and my
4695000	4700360	reaction is like oh then it's okay to eat shit you know it is kind of okay to eat shit like you
4700440	4709080	can probably reasonably like take a bar of shit and and take a snow-piercer bite out of it
4710200	4716680	a snow-piercer bar of fucking shit and and i'm like you you got a pretty good chance of surviving
4716680	4721400	like like your your natural instincts are going to make you go because you're not supposed to eat
4721400	4725800	your own shit that's not going to help you elephants elephants do because there's so much
4725800	4731080	grass in their shit that elephant shit is not toxic to elephants that's why everybody thinks
4731080	4735400	they're so you know they're so lucky to get a shot of an elephant stick and get shrunk up another
4735400	4741160	elephant's ass pulling a turnout putting it in its own mouth that's what that's what that's what
4741160	4745000	mammals vegetarian mammals wait did you do that all the time yeah i thought that was a video of
4745000	4750680	like it breaks down the cellulose it's slowly in stages so if you're if you're if you're a
4750680	4757400	vegetarian mammal and you don't eat your own shit you're an idiot because that's dessert that's
4757400	4763160	like that's like not dessert that's like fucking that's how you survive part of that like protecting
4763160	4768120	kids kind of like we have to be terrified all the time of the in that same vein uh uh uh i forget
4768120	4775240	what i was gonna say you did they have put me off of germ phobia like in case like before i could
4775560	4782280	acquire it in my adulthood was remembering in biology learning that uh the surface of our skin
4783160	4794680	is literally covered shoulder to shoulder with bugs like we we we were made out of uh little
4795320	4802200	things who just hang out on top of us and the reason why they're so important is because if
4802200	4807640	they move there's a parking spot open for somebody that might fuck us up right and we
4807640	4813240	we walk around with just we're just we're just fucking draped in it's terrifying it's like an
4813240	4820600	ht lovecraft level existence but it's great that's your that's great it's terrible to imagine
4820600	4826120	that you're constantly being infected but it's those are you're not infected they they love it
4826120	4831240	and and and they're on you and then they they live their lives and they're most importantly like
4831240	4835160	they have achieved something that humanity can't which is a perfect society
4837240	4840840	there's never a little lakers game on your elbow that explodes into riots
4842680	4849800	there's no g4 conference like like they figured it out long ago like we were born into it they
4849800	4854920	land on us and they they hang out on us and i mean you know when a thing that doesn't belong
4854920	4860840	there lands on you a mosquito a flea fuck those things those are the enemy yeah uh but then you
4860840	4866040	end up like shitting your stomach out like the ebola outbreak in africa right now but that's not
4866040	4869320	your little friends all over you those are the bad ones that's what i'm saying those are the bad
4869320	4873960	things like you get a bad thing in your body through someone else's poop i think i love what
4873960	4879320	you're saying i want to respect the little i want to respect the little friends but it is terrifying
4879320	4888040	to think that at every moment there's a legion of microscopic demons waiting for one of your little
4888040	4893000	friends to take a nap there's but but the opposite viewpoint is a beautiful thing which
4893000	4896760	is that if you're like okay i'm covered in demons then that means i'm looking at demons wrong because
4896760	4901720	they're not doing anything better that's what john wane gacy said right before they arrested him
4902760	4909960	all right we better prepare to play dnd because we're yeah you're here and these guys are here
4909960	4915640	but they don't know what's up with the dnd is this gonna make sense oh man i mean not the time to
4915640	4921800	get snobby i'm not complaining i'm not complaining i could do it i'll do whatever anyone wants me to
4923640	4927400	make it so i just lost my first episode of the next generation last night you really think you
4927400	4933320	really think there's there's such a thing as as any random configuration we could assemble that
4933320	4940280	would be worse than what we usually have in terms of playing dnd it's a fair point uh let's do it
4940280	4945320	let's do it but but but if there's another reason you don't want to do it like you're tired you don't
4945320	4950200	feel like no no i have it all planned out it's just these guys don't know where we're at you don't
4950200	4956680	do i get to play kumail's character uh i mean that's a possibility yeah there's also things
4956680	4961880	can i can i share what you said to me earlier today i mean maybe this is i i have not listened
4961880	4970440	to the last like 30 harman towns he's working on the shows you love yeah maybe this is yeah
4970440	4973960	maybe i don't drive that far because i work near where i live and i have a wife and
4973960	4979320	but um uh uh uh uh so maybe this has already been established on harman town right but duncan
4979320	4982920	was talking about how when i was like oh i might have to do dnd like i don't know how to do that
4982920	4988280	i'm saying he was like oh here's the trick if you get somebody else's character deform him and and
4988280	4997000	maim him like take take kumail he's like i cut off kumail's dick i did do i get to play his
4997000	5002520	character again well is that going to eclipse our adventure no i won't do it again
5005640	5008760	did it come back though no it's still gone okay
5015320	5019400	what do you think i think it's fine i mean i thought maybe we could just try something else
5019400	5024840	but you know what would you like to try just like some random shit what do you mean who knows man
5024840	5029400	oh you don't have any ideas well i mean you you do the thing where you dm and it's all random
5030360	5033880	so you want me to dm i i don't know i just thought we could try something
5035400	5041880	what are you saying side quest what does that mean this context though because there's no use
5041880	5045960	our characters in side quest with them erin's in a side quest which you did erin's in dragon
5045960	5049640	yeah yeah that's what i'm talking about yeah something like that exactly
5049640	5059240	it's like a side quest else worlds with the same characters you guys figure it out
5060200	5070600	crowdsourcing origin stories yes um okay so then yeah i'll give you the regular characters and
5070600	5079000	we'll go into origin stories great that sounds that sounds so dumb all right well this is what
5079000	5086600	happens when you crowdsource ideas i mean if we had like three hours well someone else come up
5086600	5092360	with an idea let's keep going all right let's keep this up dream sequence of what who's dream
5092360	5100760	sequence okay ice tea stream sequence we got ice dream the ice tea's dream sequence
5102520	5105000	that doesn't that's not that's just two three words
5105000	5114840	i you do ice tea right why don't you have an ice tea ice tea dream an old dungeon master it after
5114840	5121400	you establish things okay does that make any sense so i play ice tea and then these guys play
5121400	5129160	my entourage however you want to do it okay so and then because they won't have character
5129160	5134200	sheets i'll just tell you what their stats are yeah yeah well you'll set the stage and then i
5134280	5137720	feel like you're trying to protect kamale's character for me
5139640	5146200	i want to play the regular game i don't want to go into ice tea's dream let's go into what's
5146200	5151240	happening in the next game i'm here he's got a point he's got a point let's a little let's
5151240	5158120	dispense the all right let's do it where are we well this is exactly the problem uh well yeah
5158120	5161720	but we never know where we are either well yeah i mean that's a fair point
5163080	5167960	let me let me hold up let me get this out i have it all prepared i didn't know that none of you
5167960	5178760	would be here none of us that was it was street talk street talk someone do something funny or
5178760	5184120	we could do it we could do a we could do an improvised uh role-playing game where from what
5184120	5190600	you know of the three of us you dungeon master an adventure in which the three of us go on an
5190600	5198920	adventure and you you improvise dungeon mastering it uh-huh and we don't we don't have character
5198920	5204120	sheets we just tell you what we do yourself just give me one minute with kamale's character
5204120	5217160	again i don't want to make that decision i like both of those ideas someone else decide you decide
5217160	5222040	this is your town you're in a room with kamale's body in the middle of prices price of right
5222040	5227320	prices right style that's that sounds bad
5228840	5230040	uh
5230920	5232200	nobody's these are ideas
5234920	5240120	kamale's character goes to use the bathroom wherever you are everyone has to pee in dungeons
5240120	5247080	and dragons it's like and there are cupcakes all right okay i'm making the call yeah that's
5247160	5254280	what i asked for me alex rubens and duncan trussle are waking up uh your dungeon master
5254280	5258600	for our characters you put us where you want us then we're i think this is good we're gonna do
5258600	5270040	like a jazz great open-ended yeah so uh yeah dan harmon his employee alex rubens and christoburg
5270040	5271080	the human rogue

5854520	5860440	okay so one of the baristas comes up towards you he's like looking at you he's wearing one of
5860440	5870440	those green hats he's like hey hey man are you guys okay i grab him you oh wait hold on i gotta
5871560	5876280	i make out with him like oh you can grab him from behind let me make out with him all right
5876280	5881240	you try to grab him but he does some crazy judo move and you're on the floor before you know
5881240	5886680	what's up whoa you feel like maybe you shouldn't make out with him after that the barista yeah
5888120	5893800	but not for wanting to he's like whoa man i was just trying to help you guys out you destroyed
5893800	5901480	a bunch of our property and i'm a fourth level black belt if that exists i have a question
5902280	5909800	but for spencer i'm not probably not allowed to am i 2011 alex or am i 2014 alex in 2011 um
5910520	5917320	what do you want to be i'll do that then you're a 2014 alex just to shake things up
5919960	5925080	yeah fucking time do i have time travel abilities well i mean you yeah something like that
5927000	5930680	not that you're aware of well i i i mean i ask these guys like do you want to
5930680	5935480	do you want to get out of here and go to some other year we can't travel like can we travel
5935480	5940120	out of here like that who knows man i mean i know what the reason i'm asking is just out
5940120	5943560	of politeness because i was gonna say like let's fucking get out of here and go to some other year
5943560	5949640	but i don't want to do that if you guys don't want to why can't you time travel i'm sitting here i'm
5949640	5954600	sitting here i'm from the year 2014 and i just found out it's the year 2011 and i'm like that
5954600	5959800	i'm extrapolating from that i mean it's possible that i was sent here but i'm like maybe i have
5959800	5965080	the ability to travel through time as he's talking about time travel
5968360	5978680	i use my dagger to sever my other nipple and i eat it all right that that also happens
5980440	5989320	it's uh you vomit a little it the vomit i see there's a bit of one of my nipples and i eat that
5990600	5995640	all right that happens you don't vomit that time i just run into the street and i'm like
5996280	5999160	just don't i'm sorry whatever i did i'm sorry
6001160	6005640	like i it's not like i created the show because i wanted it to be bad
6008360	6011480	and honestly it's counterproductive to experiment with the notion
6012360	6018440	i i i go up to dan harman and i say hey i'm i'm from the future you get picked up again
6019240	6025320	you get rehired and then you get hired on yahoo but it's a good thing that sounds awful that
6025320	6030360	sounds awful no no no it's good because in the future god netflix has netflix already blown up
6030360	6035000	i forget in 2011 i don't know god this sounds terrible no no it's not it's a whole new world
6035000	6040600	it's 2011 i just want to be 30 rock that's all i want 30 rock's done
6040600	6046600	30 rock's done man like it oh i stand on top of a car i don't know what it is
6046600	6053480	but listening to them talk i climb on top of a car my shirts off blood geysering out of my
6053480	6062840	recently cut off nipples and i and i scream out what has happened to life that people care about
6062840	6071960	this and i stick out my tongue and i'm about to cut off my tongue i but i run up and i kiss him i
6071960	6078440	i i keep him from making out with him so he doesn't cut off his tongue all right i bound up the i bound
