0	24000	Oh yeah! Can you feel it? Oh baby! Let me hear it! Let me hear it baby! Give it up!
24000	32000	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Harmontown is now in session!
32000	38000	I'm the comptroller tonight, Rob Trapp!
38000	43000	Oh boy! Lower your expectations!
43000	49000	Alright, let's bring out Spencer! Spencer! Spencer's engine meters!
49000	64000	Alright, here we go! Ladies and gentlemen, the man himself, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Doug Harmon!
64000	73000	Alright! Alright! Alright, Dan!
73000	80000	Dan! Dan! Dan Harmon! That's a nice shirt you're wearing there tonight, Dan!
80000	86000	Where'd you get a shirt like that? Where does one get a shirt like that, Dan?
86000	93000	Like, if I wanted to click on your chest, what would pop up? Would Amazon pop up?
93000	98000	Or would Tea Public pop up? Or would...
98000	100000	The rapper?
100000	105000	The rapper pop up! Where can I get a shirt like that?
105000	108000	Zen Monkey Studios, I think is the...
108000	110000	Zen Monkey Studios!
110000	117000	They've taken it upon themselves to be as prolific as the bootleggers. That's the new t-shirt market.
117000	121000	You've got to make a million t-shirts a week, so they're all very relevant.
121000	125000	That's a long slogan!
125000	133000	Uh, guest controller Rob Schwab is here with us tonight.
133000	139000	I was in my pajamas, I was in my pajamas watching South Park reruns,
139000	143000	snuggling with my dog and eating my cereal.
143000	146000	You don't want to get those in the wrong order.
146000	149000	Oh, boy.
149000	152000	Why?
152000	157000	And then I texted you, and I said, Jeff dropped out of the show,
157000	161000	and so I replaced him with Ryan Ridley, who just dropped out of the show,
161000	166000	and then Bobcat Goldthwaite cannot do it,
166000	170000	and Andy Kidler's not writing back,
170000	176000	and to make a long story short, would you do me the honor of guest controlling tonight?
176000	182000	Yes, and call you an Uber, too.
182000	187000	Where you bail me out, and while you're up, why don't you press the button
187000	190000	to call you an Uber and pick me up.
190000	191000	You asked...
191000	193000	I said, hey, have you left yet?
193000	197000	No, you want to pick me up?
197000	199000	Oh, he's going to prove me wrong.
199000	202000	No, I'm just looking at my notes here.
202000	204000	There's not a lot of them.
204000	207000	Hi, Spencer. I haven't seen you in a while, Spencer.
207000	208000	Hey, man, yeah.
208000	211000	I didn't go to the movie, watch movies with you that time you invited me.
211000	212000	I feel bad.
212000	215000	You mean my birthday party?
215000	216000	Oh, no.
216000	219000	I was thinking about a completely unrelated occasion.
219000	222000	Yeah, that was another time you didn't write me back.
222000	224000	Yeah, no.
224000	228000	It happens a lot. I'm a bad person.
228000	229000	Hey, Dan.
229000	231000	Hello.
231000	236000	Tonight was a rare sighting of the very, very unique, fleeting,
236000	239000	evasive, full-panted Spencer.
239000	240000	I'm wearing pants.
240000	245000	Spencer, stand up and let's not look at your legs.
245000	246000	Show us some lack of leg.
246000	251000	Whoo!
251000	253000	Whoo!
253000	254000	Are those at the bottom of the drawer?
254000	256000	For most angles, that just looks like shorts, though.
256000	257000	What's that?
257000	260000	For most angles, that would have just looked like shorts would, you know,
260000	262000	above the knees and everything.
262000	268000	All right, so, you know, the Ridley,
268000	271000	I just wanted to make fun of him because he bailed like two hours before the show.
271000	274000	How did that conversation go?
274000	277000	Hey, man.
277000	281000	Well, I don't talk to anybody on the phone, but I'll talk, you know, it was, let's see.
281000	284000	Guess what happened.
285000	288000	This is Ridley's professionalism.
288000	292000	I bothered to text him at 5.03 p.m. and said,
292000	296000	you're going to comptroller tonight because I asked him on Friday before I left.
296000	301000	Oh, I wasn't doing anything Friday either.
301000	304000	I mean, okay.
304000	308000	I just got back on Sunday at 5.03 p.m. and I said, you're going to comptroller tonight.
308000	310000	That's called verification.
310000	311000	That's not.
311000	312000	It's called confirmation.
312000	316000	It's confirming the thing.
316000	320000	And he checks back, I can't tonight.
320000	324000	And I text back, fuck.
324000	327000	And then I started like texting people like crazy.
327000	332000	And then at some point in there, he said, you don't have any other options.
332000	334000	And I said, I'll figure something out.
334000	336000	That's not exciting.
336000	338000	And then his response was, okay.
338000	341000	All of that means that he's on another Tinder date.
341000	342000	That's what that means.
342000	346000	He swiped right or got swiped right.
346000	347000	I don't get it.
347000	348000	I don't get it, man.
348000	352000	Well, the old fellows were in an Uber coming here.
352000	357000	And so it got us to talking about the tenders, neither of which we've ever used
357000	362000	because I was married and you've been married a while now, probably pre-Tinder marriage.
362000	363000	Pre-Tinder marriage.
363000	367000	And definitely we both have pre-Tinder bodies.
367000	368000	That's true.
368000	372000	I mean, you're a fit guy, but I'm just meaning like we're fucking old.
372000	379000	I mean, it's like, oh, Tinder, time to start a fire with Ralph from marketing.
379000	383000	No, I want sash from Subway.
383000	388000	I'm horny, not naive.
388000	393000	I don't want someone to explain ISIS to me.
393000	396000	I want to come.
397000	402000	I can't explain ISIS to anybody.
402000	407000	But for real, and then Rob was saying, so it's just for fucking.
407000	410000	Is it just for fucking or is it for...
410000	412000	Well, I don't think it's for love.
412000	414000	I think it's for fucking.
414000	415000	It's not for moving in.
415000	417000	And it's not move an ender.
417000	419000	No.
419000	420000	Oh, wait.
420000	421000	There's a lesbian joke in there somewhere, right?
421000	424000	Isn't that the lesbian stereotype that they move in with each other?
424000	432000	You can write that joke backwards and make your lesbian friends feel sad and dehumanized.
432000	434000	Write it backwards?
434000	435000	Yeah, it's cool.
435000	437000	Now that you know the punch line is moving in there.
437000	441000	So you go like, hey, did you hear that there's a dating app for lesbians?
441000	443000	It's called moving in there.
443000	445000	I mean, I'm just saying, this is how comedy works.
445000	446000	It's like blocks.
446000	448000	You just go, you don't laugh.
448000	450000	You just go, got milk.
450000	453000	It's five o'clock.
453000	456000	My children are hungry.
456000	459000	I don't have children.
459000	468000	My mannequin needs a new pair of shoe.
468000	469000	Anyway.
469000	473000	So is there maybe a millennial?
473000	474000	Let's not be ageist.
474000	478000	There might be a 48-year-old person here that's like a Tinder expert.
478000	480000	But does that mean we want to just come up and...
480000	481000	I would love to.
481000	482000	Hello.
482000	483000	Hello.
483000	484000	He's got like a gold...
484000	486000	Ron Jeremy looking guy comes up with a marching name.
486000	488000	The I.B. of service.
488000	493000	My name is Sebastian Fuxalot.
493000	495000	Some George the K guy comes up.
495000	497000	Oh, my.
497000	498000	Yeah.
498000	502000	Well, is there anybody that's been getting use out of Tinder one way or another?
502000	503000	Uh-oh.
503000	504000	All right.
504000	505000	We got...
505000	511000	I think we have a familiar Harman town person here in front of our family.
511000	512000	A front rower.
512000	513000	Yeah.
513000	514000	Let's make this easy.
514000	515000	Come on up and...
515000	516000	Yay!
516000	517000	All right.
517000	518000	All right.
518000	521000	Well, this is a segment called...
521000	526000	Oh, if you sit down here, then it's easy for the...
526000	528000	Carl's Jr. or whoever's...
528000	534000	Whoever we work for now.
534000	536000	Because you're so thin, it was blocking you.
536000	537000	Aw, Dan.
537000	539000	What a gentleman.
539000	544000	I objectified her.
544000	545000	Okay.
545000	546000	So, yeah.
546000	547000	Your name again?
547000	548000	I'm Leah.
548000	549000	Leah.
549000	550000	Okay.
550000	551000	You've been up here before, right?
551000	553000	Like a year and a half ago or something like that.
553000	554000	To the day.
554000	555000	Yeah.
555000	556000	It's on my calendar.
556000	557000	There are little hearts on it.
557000	559000	So this is actually why I'm very serious.
559000	560000	All right.
560000	561000	So...
561000	562000	I play Dandy at one point.
562000	563000	Right.
563000	564000	So Tinder...
564000	565000	Tinder us.
565000	566000	Like...
566000	567000	The grandpa...
567000	571000	Talk us through a day in the life of the Tinder person.
571000	572000	Yeah.
572000	575000	I actually haven't been on it for a year, but I used to be...
575000	576000	Oh, God.
576000	577000	I used to be on it, like, a lot.
577000	578000	I definitely...
578000	581000	You know, I definitely got some mileage out of that web.
581000	583000	Jesus Christ.
583000	585000	You sure?
585000	586000	Well, what is...
586000	587000	Okay.
587000	588000	Well, what does mileage mean?
588000	589000	I mean, what did I...
589000	590000	Mileage?
590000	591000	What is the typical...
591000	593000	What is the typical Tinder encounter?
593000	594000	Holy shit.
594000	595000	Like, from soup to nuts.
595000	596000	Oh, man.
596000	597000	And I do mean...
597000	598000	I mean, it's...
600000	601000	Miles of dick.
601000	603000	What's the soup?
603000	605000	It's actual soup.
605000	608000	If you're near a soup place.
610000	613000	Well, actually, I'm looking for a new place to live right now
613000	616000	because my housemate met her boyfriend on Tinder,
616000	617000	and so he's moving in.
617000	619000	So it is for love sometimes.
619000	620000	Sometimes it's for love.
620000	621000	Well, love finds a way.
621000	622000	Yeah.
622000	625000	You always try to hit it and quit it.
626000	628000	Fire at close range, you think.
628000	630000	But then you fall in love because it's like...
630000	633000	That frog DNA in there, and then all...
634000	635000	You know, nature...
635000	636000	Then you start laning your eggs.
636000	637000	In your eggs.
637000	638000	In your eggs, man.
638000	639000	Then you're...
639000	640000	Next thing you know, you're out of the paddock,
640000	641000	and you're at site B.
641000	642000	T-Rex is after you.
642000	643000	You got to go...
643000	646000	Must go faster, man.
646000	647000	Got to get out of there.
647000	649000	Otherwise, that T-Rex...
649000	650000	It doesn't matter who throws a road flare.
650000	651000	Your visual acuity...
651000	652000	Shit, man.
652000	653000	Is it based on light?
653000	654000	It's based on motion.
654000	655000	Right, yeah.
655000	658000	Got to eat that toilet lawyer and fucking...
659000	660000	You know what I'm talking about.
660000	662000	Talking about family.
665000	669000	Objects are closer than they are.
669000	670000	In an ironic sense.
670000	672000	Yeah, man.
672000	673000	Yeah, man.
673000	675000	Just got to fucking make that girl clever.
675000	676000	Man.
677000	678000	Shit.
678000	679000	Yeah.
679000	682000	You got to get in that plastic hamster ball and just slide.
683000	685000	You got to have that dream sequence
685000	687000	where the raptor's talking at you.
689000	691000	Wait, is that from the Clone Wars?
691000	692000	That's the third one.
692000	693000	Third one.
693000	694000	Oh, okay.
694000	695000	We saw that in the theater.
695000	696000	Oh, that's right.
696000	697000	Yeah, then they say, like, hey, Kevin, get over here.
697000	698000	Hey.
698000	699000	Hey.
699000	700000	All right, Leah.
700000	703000	Hey, I'm a raptor, and I'm in your dream,
703000	705000	and I'm talking to you.
705000	706000	It's like that.
706000	708000	It's just like Sam Neill's like...
709000	710000	And then the raptor goes,
710000	712000	hey, can I have some peanuts?
713000	716000	And somebody went, that's terrifying.
718000	720000	All right, so back to Tinder.
720000	724000	All right, so you have your phone.
725000	729000	Where are you typically surfing your Tinder?
730000	732000	I used to do it with my housemate, too,
732000	735000	and I've also done it with Paul the Whip guy.
736000	737000	Yeah.
737000	739000	So sometimes it's drunk tindering,
739000	740000	which is kind of more fun,
740000	742000	because then it's just like a big fun judging game
742000	743000	with your buddies.
743000	744000	Is there a limit on that?
744000	746000	Like on those music sharing things
746000	748000	where they don't want you to be able to do next
748000	749000	too many times,
749000	751000	because then that's like not having to buy music.
751000	753000	So they're like, look, you've got to marry one of these guys.
753000	755000	Or I'll see you tomorrow.
755000	756000	I know what you're doing.
756000	757000	You're judging us.
758000	761000	And unless it changed, I don't think so,
761000	763000	but once in a while it'll run out of people,
763000	765000	which is a really sad moment where they're like,
765000	768000	there's no one else in your area for you.
768000	769000	Yeah.
769000	771000	You insatiable sarlacc bit.
772000	775000	You bottomless gaping.
779000	780000	Gaping.
780000	781000	Sex monster.
781000	782000	Oh, my gosh.
784000	785000	Okay, so then you're swiping.
785000	787000	Sometimes you're doing it for funsies,
787000	789000	like hate swiping.
789000	790000	Yeah.
792000	794000	But then sometimes you're doing it for onesies.
795000	796000	For onesies.
797000	798000	Yeah, right.
798000	799000	You're swiping.
799000	800000	Yeah, well, it's always pretty sincere
800000	801000	even if you're doing it with a buddy,
801000	803000	like the objective is always to get it dated.
803000	805000	Doing it with a buddy.
805000	806000	Like, what are you doing?
806000	808000	Like, you're sitting on the couch.
808000	809000	Yeah.
809000	810000	And you're looking at people together,
810000	811000	and you're like, I don't like him.
811000	812000	I can't say his name.
812000	813000	Fuck that guy, you know.
813000	814000	Right.
818000	820000	That's better than a compliment.
821000	824000	Really, any minority?
829000	830000	So, like, you swipe.
830000	834000	Okay, but then you see a gentleman,
834000	836000	not to presume, but like,
836000	838000	you see a couple apart.
838000	839000	A couple.
840000	841000	I've swiped a couple before.
841000	842000	You see a person,
842000	844000	you see a human meat thing.
844000	845000	Yeah.
845000	848000	And you go, like it,
849000	850000	and then you, and then so then,
850000	851000	is that person getting,
851000	852000	are you texting them?
852000	853000	Does it go into a chat thing?
853000	854000	Yeah, if you both,
854000	855000	you can swipe left,
855000	857000	which means you're not interested.
857000	859000	Swipe right means that you are interested,
859000	861000	and if you both swipe right to each other,
861000	863000	then you're sent to a chat.
863000	864000	So then you can chat with each other.
864000	866000	What if you don't want to?
866000	867000	Most of the time you don't,
867000	870000	and that's always almost like a weird sad thing,
870000	871000	because you'll match with someone,
871000	872000	and it'll tell you it's a match,
872000	873000	and then they're like,
873000	874000	do you want to keep playing,
874000	875000	or do you want to talk to this person?
875000	876000	You're like, I want to keep playing.
877000	879000	Keep playing, like looking further,
879000	880000	or keep like...
880000	881000	It becomes an addiction after a while.
881000	882000	It's just like anything else,
882000	883000	where you're just like,
883000	885000	I just like to swipe things, you know?
885000	886000	So can you explain,
886000	888000	but the people that you're swiping,
888000	889000	they're also,
889000	891000	they're all the people that are actively swiping,
891000	893000	so there's no chance that you're swiping somebody
893000	895000	who's like taking a map.
895000	898000	Like everyone who's swiping is swiping each other.
898000	900000	No, you don't have to be online right then.
900000	901000	Okay.
901000	903000	Like it's anybody that's active on Tinder,
903000	904000	and it's based on like,
904000	906000	what age range you said you're looking for,
906000	909000	and like the distance that you're interested in driving,
909000	911000	and since it's LA, it's like nothing overnight.
911000	913000	Okay, so it's the average thing.
913000	915000	Maybe we should just skip all the way ahead, too,
915000	917000	if you don't mind us asking this question.
917000	918000	Yeah, yeah.
918000	922000	Like, how many, out of all the times that you...
922000	923000	I'm listening.
925000	927000	How many, I mean,
927000	930000	how many times is this just hooking up?
930000	933000	How many times is it just like a one night, one day,
933000	935000	stand?
935000	937000	A lot, a significant amount.
937000	939000	But then also I dated a guy,
939000	941000	dated a strong word,
941000	944000	I was interacting with a man for 14 months
944000	946000	that I met on Tinder.
946000	950000	Yeah, but a lot of one or a few time interactions.
950000	952000	Do you get the impression that the people,
952000	955000	most of the people that are using it,
955000	959000	are they, is it like dating,
959000	962000	just like everything else,
962000	963000	where it's like, well, yeah,
963000	965000	I want to fuck probably eventually,
965000	967000	maybe even really fast,
967000	969000	but I'm also not like...
969000	972000	Or is it just like a gas station bathroom?
972000	974000	Well...
974000	976000	That's a glory hole, but with a face.
976000	978000	Is it like E24 for pussy?
980000	981000	I actually know...
981000	983000	You in the mood for Chinese?
983000	985000	He's not for banging.
987000	989000	I actually know three couples
990000	993000	that are like serious couples from Tinder.
993000	995000	That's good odds.
995000	996000	Yeah, I mean...
996000	999000	Isn't it about fucking having sex
999000	1000000	and then people are like,
1000000	1003000	oh, having sex is so great, let's date.
1003000	1005000	And then, you know, sometimes relationships happen.
1005000	1006000	No, what happened was,
1006000	1008000	okay, Tinder is based on the app Grinder,
1008000	1010000	which is for the gay community,
1010000	1012000	and so that's just for fucking.
1012000	1014000	So that's why originally it was like,
1014000	1015000	oh, you're hot, I'm hot,
1015000	1017000	do you want to bang, let's go over there.
1018000	1020000	And then...
1020000	1021000	The houses.
1021000	1023000	There's two houses involved.
1023000	1024000	It's more adventurous.
1024000	1027000	There's bathrooms in both of those houses.
1027000	1029000	Sometimes multiple bathrooms.
1029000	1030000	This is West Hollywood.
1030000	1032000	There's a house and there's a house,
1032000	1034000	but then there's in between each of the houses,
1034000	1037000	there's a special gay bathroom.
1038000	1041000	Just for neighbors.
1041000	1043000	Okay, got it, got it, got it.
1043000	1046000	Right, so it's based on Grindr,
1046000	1048000	but then now it's Tinder,
1048000	1050000	and so now guys have to deal with women.
1050000	1053000	So, I mean, if guys had their way,
1053000	1054000	I'm sure it'd still just be like,
1054000	1055000	do you want to meet in between our houses
1055000	1058000	at the secret heterosexual bath house?
1058000	1061000	But then women are like, no, I want you to buy me dinner
1061000	1064000	and learn my name, and they're like, God damn it.
1064000	1066000	And so that's what Tinder is.
1066000	1068000	It's like a meeting of the sexes
1068000	1070000	where the men, I'm sure, you know.
1070000	1073000	But then one of my guy friends said
1073000	1075000	that he had an account and he tried different things,
1075000	1076000	and so when he was saying like,
1076000	1077000	maybe I want a girlfriend,
1077000	1079000	he was only getting like some people,
1079000	1080000	and eventually he changed it where he was like,
1080000	1081000	I'm trying to bang.
1081000	1083000	And then he'd say, you have girls
1083000	1084000	hitting him up all the time.
1084000	1086000	So he was like, girls are just as nasty as the guys, man.
1086000	1089000	So it's all just what you're looking for.
1089000	1090000	Is that what he's saying?
1090000	1091000	Oh, go ahead.
1091000	1092000	No, go ahead.
1092000	1094000	No, it's too late.
1097000	1100000	I mean, just as many girls are nasty as guys.
1100000	1101000	Yeah, for sure.
1101000	1104000	So the app's probably about, obviously it is a good thing
1104000	1106000	because people are, you're using it.
1106000	1108000	So that's the definition of it being good, right?
1108000	1115000	And nobody's getting hurt more than when they use Uber.
1115000	1121000	So like it is, because I find, you know,
1121000	1123000	that like when you're talking about sex with people,
1123000	1126000	it's like you can never, you can never tell,
1126000	1127000	but it's like we all kind of like,
1127000	1129000	we have these like sort of, I don't know,
1129000	1131000	like we're always worried about everybody else,
1131000	1133000	like worrying about us.
1133000	1135000	And so it's hard to, you know,
1135000	1140000	that's what that guy found out, that Kinsey guy.
1140000	1143000	It's like people, everybody's like fucked up.
1143000	1145000	Everybody's like a crazy sexual snowflake.
1145000	1148000	And then like a big thing that most people share
1148000	1151000	is that they'd love to talk about it with somebody
1151000	1153000	and love to like indulge lots of it
1153000	1155000	and do all kinds of weird things.
1155000	1157000	But then we have this whole other part that's like,
1157000	1159000	well, I'm not actively coming right now,
1159000	1161000	so I need to like not be afraid of people
1161000	1164000	and I need to like not, I need to be respected
1164000	1166000	and allowed to be a senator.
1166000	1170000	Yeah, so I don't know what my point is.
1170000	1173000	A bunch of really obvious shit is my point.
1173000	1176000	On Tinder, is it like you have profiles
1176000	1178000	and this is what I like and this is what,
1178000	1180000	do you have it on your phone?
1180000	1181000	Yeah, it's on your phone.
1181000	1184000	Can we look up Ridley's profile?
1184000	1186000	Is it available to search for people?
1186000	1187000	No.
1187000	1189000	It's not like Instagram.
1189000	1191000	You could set up a profile right now
1191000	1194000	and put Ridley's thing in the age range
1194000	1196000	and then you'd probably come up eventually.
1196000	1199000	I think Ridley might be 53, I don't know.
1199000	1201000	I can't tell.
1201000	1204000	Rob said he's tearing up Los Angeles.
1204000	1208000	He's like Paul Bunyan's plow.
1208000	1211000	He's making lakes using Tinder.
1211000	1214000	That text conversation was very unapologetic
1214000	1216000	and very hurt.
1216000	1218000	I think he got swiped.
1218000	1220000	God knows I did.
1220000	1224000	Side swiped.
1224000	1230000	My friendship loyalty Hyundai got,
1230000	1232000	the rearview mirror got clipped
1232000	1237000	by his fucking weird dick Ferrari.
1237000	1239000	All right, well let's thank Leo
1239000	1243000	for explaining some of Tinder to me.
1243000	1246000	I know you guys didn't need to understand it.
1246000	1253000	I like getting, I like being older than people.
1253000	1259000	Especially women.
1259000	1262000	Who wants to be younger than them?
1262000	1265000	You guys, I'm sorry, that was funny,
1265000	1270000	but I understand, I understand.
1270000	1274000	But we have a new, I don't know.
1274000	1276000	All right, let's clean up.
1276000	1277000	Jesus Christ.
1277000	1279000	Let's fucking Leah came over
1279000	1281000	and the place is a goddamn mess.
1281000	1282000	I know.
1282000	1283000	Get your shit together.
1283000	1285000	She leaves her Cheeto Bool bowl all over the place.
1285000	1287000	All she says is just swiping and fucking
1287000	1289000	and that's all she cares about.
1289000	1292000	She doesn't put anything back where she found it.
1292000	1294000	Except, you know.
1294000	1296000	Stop it.
1296000	1297000	Don't go in.
1297000	1299000	Don't finish that sentence.
1300000	1302000	Please don't finish that sentence.
1302000	1304000	She puts dick back where she found it.
1304000	1306000	Okay, you finished the sentence
1306000	1308000	when I just specifically asked you
1308000	1310000	to not finish the sentence
1310000	1311000	and you finished the sentence.
1311000	1313000	I wasn't sure you knew what I was going to say.
1313000	1314000	I knew what you were going to say.
1314000	1316000	That's why I said don't finish that sentence
1316000	1317000	and you finished it.
1317000	1318000	You finished it.
1318000	1320000	You finished the sentence.
1320000	1324000	You're a finisher.
1325000	1328000	Piece of shit.
1328000	1330000	You're not a piece of shit.
1330000	1331000	I'm sorry.
1331000	1332000	I went too far.
1332000	1333000	You're a good guy.
1333000	1335000	I'm glad I'm here.
1335000	1336000	All right.
1336000	1338000	Thank you for swiping
1338000	1341000	tonight's conversation about that
1341000	1343000	and now we're going to have
1343000	1345000	a slightly more serious, more dramatic one.
1345000	1348000	But it's also about
1348000	1350000	it's also about
1350000	1352000	it's about connections with strangers
1352000	1354000	that are possible through technology.
1354000	1355000	Let's put it that way.
1355000	1358000	Okay, let's do that.
1358000	1360000	I'll just unceremoniously bring him out
1360000	1362000	because he's not an entertainer.
1362000	1363000	He's just a new friend.
1363000	1365000	I met him at a bar.
1365000	1367000	Which bar?
1367000	1368000	I met him at the drawing room,
1368000	1369000	which is where everybody goes after the show usually.
1369000	1370000	That's true.
1370000	1374000	I was there on probably a Tuesday morning
1374000	1378000	and started small talking
1378000	1381000	and then found out that this guy's a pretty interesting story.
1381000	1383000	I was like, would you please come on my show
1383000	1384000	and let's talk about it.
1384000	1385000	Is he back there?
1385000	1387000	Is he ready?
1387000	1389000	No one's listening.
1389000	1390000	Oh, okay.
1390000	1393000	Let's welcome our new friend Kyle.
1393000	1394000	Kyle!
1394000	1400000	It's sitting that one.
1400000	1403000	Thanks for coming.
1403000	1405000	Give it up for Kyle.
1405000	1406000	Kyle.
1406000	1407000	I don't do this.
1407000	1409000	I met him at a bar.
1409000	1410000	Kyle.
1410000	1411000	Kyle.
1411000	1412000	How's it going?
1412000	1413000	Good, good.
1413000	1414000	Thanks for coming out here
1414000	1415000	and telling us your story.
1415000	1417000	It's pretty personal,
1417000	1420000	but it's also like a weird kind of TV movie shit.
1420000	1424000	So I pressed him to come on the show.
1424000	1432000	So probably this separates you from almost everyone in this room,
1432000	1434000	although it would be fun if there was one guy that was like,
1434000	1435000	wait, me too.
1435000	1436000	Pretty cool, actually.
1436000	1439000	Is that you currently have the beating heart
1439000	1441000	of a complete stranger in your chest.
1441000	1442000	I do.
1442000	1444000	Having gotten a heart transplant.
1444000	1445000	How many years ago?
1445000	1448000	Actually, today is my anniversary.
1448000	1449000	What, 11 years?
1449000	1450000	11 years.
1450000	1451000	Whoa!
1451000	1453000	Today was the day I got it.
1453000	1454000	Wow.
1454000	1455000	How old are you right now?
1455000	1456000	What's that?
1456000	1457000	How old are you right now?
1457000	1458000	I'm 31.
1458000	1459000	31?
1459000	1460000	Yeah, when I got it.
1460000	1462000	Yeah, so let's start there.
1462000	1464000	The reason why you needed a heart transplant
1464000	1467000	is not because you were eating too many French fries.
1467000	1468000	No, no, no.
1468000	1470000	My diet was not.
1470000	1477000	I was born with a disease called transposition of the great vessels.
1477000	1479000	So your heart is backwards
1479000	1482000	and your blood flows backwards.
1482000	1486000	So you loved the rain and hated children.
1486000	1487000	I did, yeah.
1487000	1489000	I was like, I can't do this.
1489000	1491000	I just, you know, you people get away from me.
1491000	1493000	You would take Christmas presents.
1493000	1494000	You were the Grinch.
1494000	1495000	Yeah, I was the Grinch.
1495000	1496000	I was the Grinch.
1496000	1497000	I was the Grinch.
1497000	1498000	I was like stuck in a house the whole time.
1498000	1500000	Like bubble, you know, like in a bubble, you know.
1500000	1501000	Yeah, so you had this.
1501000	1504000	So what is the nature of that?
1504000	1506000	Like for our friend Sika comes on sometimes
1506000	1508000	and he's like, he's been at multiple aneurysms
1508000	1510000	and they can't figure out what, why that is.
1510000	1514000	But his prognosis is basically that he has to like,
1514000	1517000	just be satisfied with the fact that at any minute,
1517000	1519000	like something terrible could just happen in his brain.
1519000	1521000	Yeah, I mean, I'm still a little bit there.
1522000	1524000	But you were certainly there before the transplant.
1524000	1525000	Oh yeah, that was real bad.
1525000	1526000	You were just like, what did the doctors tell you
1526000	1527000	before the transplant?
1527000	1529000	Like what was your, what was your prognosis?
1529000	1530000	Is that the word?
1530000	1531000	I was in heart failure.
1531000	1532000	So my heart was dying.
1532000	1535000	They did all they could do to fix it.
1535000	1540000	After I had five pacemakers and after the fifth one,
1540000	1541000	didn't work.
1541000	1546000	So they were, that was me going on a list.
1546000	1548000	Yeah, so the doctors were pretty much like your only option
1548000	1550000	is someone else's heart.
1550000	1551000	So.
1551000	1554000	So then describe to us, because I think you always hear,
1554000	1555000	I'm going, I don't know.
1555000	1558000	Heart transplant is a concept from the news.
1558000	1560000	It's like what I've never been able to ask somebody.
1560000	1562000	It's like, so what is it?
1562000	1564000	You're not sitting in a hospital waiting
1564000	1566000	because it took how long to get.
1566000	1569000	So basically, after I graduated high school,
1569000	1572000	my heart was, I was in failure.
1572000	1575000	And then my doctor, funny enough, she was hilarious.
1575000	1579000	She's like, yeah, I don't trust any doctors in Washington
1579000	1580000	to help you out right now.
1580000	1583000	So you should go to Stanford, and they will give you
1583000	1584000	a better heart.
1584000	1585000	And so I went there.
1585000	1586000	You go on a list.
1586000	1588000	You get the process going.
1588000	1590000	But they try to mend it as much as they can, though.
1590000	1591000	They try to.
1591000	1592000	Oh, they try to mend the.
1592000	1594000	Like they try to fix it as much as they can.
1594000	1595000	Right.
1595000	1597000	So that's like another pacemaker.
1597000	1599000	Maybe something that you like fix with a heart valve,
1599000	1600000	but I didn't need any of that.
1600000	1602000	And it was just more pacemaker stuff.
1602000	1604000	So it was just kind of that whole.
1605000	1609000	So then at the moment when a donor becomes available,
1609000	1613000	and it's go time, which it must be a huge rush,
1613000	1616000	an emergency, you're not sitting in a hospital.
1616000	1618000	You're hanging out.
1618000	1619000	No, I'm hanging out at home.
1619000	1621000	I was at home with my sister.
1621000	1623000	She moved to help me out and my mom.
1623000	1629000	And got the call around dinner time, I guess, 5 o'clock.
1629000	1631000	Do you remember what you were doing the moment
1631000	1632000	that the phone rang?
1632000	1634000	I was cooking dinner.
1634000	1635000	I like to cook.
1635000	1636000	That's what I do nowadays.
1636000	1637000	And I work in the world.
1637000	1638000	What were you making?
1638000	1639000	What was I making?
1639000	1640000	Something without salt.
1640000	1641000	French fries?
1641000	1642000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1642000	1644000	Something real high.
1644000	1646000	Like I'm just going to do this.
1646000	1647000	No, no.
1647000	1648000	Something low salt.
1648000	1650000	Something like I can't.
1650000	1653000	My dietary restrictions were pretty minimal.
1653000	1655000	But yeah, I was with my sister.
1655000	1656000	And I got the call.
1656000	1660000	And you never meet your transplant doctor ever.
1660000	1661000	It's not.
1661000	1663000	They just do the surgeries.
1663000	1665000	I have another doctor that helped me out.
1665000	1668000	And the doctor that called me is a fellow.
1668000	1672000	So I want to get to that doctor thing in one second.
1672000	1674000	Just to get the picture.
1674000	1675000	Is this a cell phone time?
1675000	1676000	Or was this pre-cell phone?
1676000	1679000	Yeah, I think I had Nokia brick.
1679000	1680000	I miss that thing too.
1680000	1681000	Those were great.
1681000	1682000	Those were durable.
1682000	1683000	It's a voice call.
1683000	1687000	The doctor's a guy on the other line.
1688000	1690000	He has the first words were, are you Kyle?
1690000	1691000	And I said, yes, I'm Kyle.
1691000	1696000	And he just said, are you, how are you feeling today?
1696000	1697000	I thought it was pretty creepy.
1697000	1699000	Some guy just calling and saying that.
1699000	1702000	And I was like, you know, my body's pretty good, actually.
1702000	1704000	I'm pretty good.
1704000	1708000	But he said, are you feeling ready to get a transplant?
1708000	1711000	And I, yeah, that was it.
1711000	1716000	He didn't do anything clever like, hey, can I get you anything?
1717000	1720000	Like a human heart.
1720000	1724000	He's like, so I got this box, or what's in the box?
1727000	1730000	OK, so then you're like, holy shit, this is it.
1730000	1731000	Yeah.
1731000	1733000	How much fear is there versus how much like relief?
1733000	1735000	Because I mean, I imagine the life is already fear.
1735000	1736000	It was all fear.
1736000	1737000	Oh, really?
1737000	1740000	So you're not like, oh, my God, this is better than nothing.
1740000	1742000	Therefore, it's all good.
1742000	1747000	The chances were still like 8% good and 20%, you know.
1747000	1750000	That sounds so terrifying to me.
1750000	1752000	Like I'm getting anxiety just thinking about it
1752000	1757000	because they have to break open your ribcage
1757000	1763000	and take your old heart out, put it on a plate.
1763000	1765000	All right, grab zombies.
1765000	1768000	And then get a new one.
1768000	1769000	But you're going to.
1769000	1771000	And they killed my brain open, too, for fun.
1771000	1775000	But seriously, they're taking your heart out of your body
1775000	1778000	and connecting your throat.
1778000	1780000	I don't know if you know the details of it,
1780000	1787000	but how long is your body without a heart?
1787000	1791000	At the time, though, when I got the call,
1791000	1795000	that would be my fourth open heart surgery.
1795000	1798000	So at the time, I didn't have a sternum.
1798000	1799000	They hit replete.
1799000	1801000	They put zippers in.
1801000	1803000	They just kind of like zip it up,
1803000	1805000	throw some cartilage back in there, and then they're like,
1805000	1806000	you're good to go.
1806000	1807000	They're like, we're coming back in here.
1807000	1809000	I don't want to be cynical, but I also
1809000	1810000	don't want to keep stabbing you.
1810000	1812000	You've got to have fun with it, you know?
1812000	1813000	It's like play-doh.
1813000	1815000	Please don't look down, Kyle.
1815000	1817000	But at this time, you'll thank me later.
1817000	1820000	It's mainly duct tape.
1820000	1823000	Wait, what do you have instead of a sternum?
1823000	1825000	I don't really know.
1825000	1826000	Is there nothing there?
1826000	1827000	Nothing there?
1827000	1828000	Yeah.
1828000	1829000	I'm touching myself.
1829000	1830000	Yep.
1830000	1831000	Yeah.
1831000	1832000	Yeah.
1832000	1833000	There's a little bit of a sternum there at the top.
1833000	1834000	Yeah.
1834000	1835000	Holy shit.
1835000	1836000	So what if you get punched?
1836000	1840000	So wait, you're in serious danger that if you were to ever take a car door to the chest,
1840000	1842000	you could actually get really fucked up?
1842000	1845000	A car door would mess me up or a nice punch or anything like that.
1845000	1846000	Jesus.
1846000	1847000	All right.
1847000	1848000	So then you go into-
1848000	1850000	It's like heartwarming story for everybody here.
1850000	1851000	All right.
1851000	1852000	Sorry.
1852000	1853000	They've been through so much first.
1853000	1854000	All right, good.
1854000	1855000	Sweet.
1855000	1856000	I don't know.
1856000	1857000	Did you see the Aubrey Plaza episode?
1857000	1858000	It was-
1858000	1859000	I listened to it, actually.
1859000	1860000	I listened to it.
1860000	1861000	I'm kidding.
1861000	1862000	I love the sextal thing.
1862000	1863000	It's great.
1863000	1864000	I did that for the laugh.
1864000	1866000	I really enjoyed her.
1866000	1867000	She's really cool.
1867000	1868000	I don't know why you did that.
1868000	1869000	She's an awesome person.
1869000	1872000	That was for a cheap, cheap laugh because my interviewing was bad.
1872000	1877000	She's a really cool, very talented person, and you're talking shit about her most of the
1877000	1878000	time here.
1878000	1882000	I went for a very, very cheap, very terrible laugh.
1882000	1884000	It was pretty shitty of you.
1885000	1886000	It's a good person.
1886000	1887000	It's not going to be shitty.
1887000	1888000	Never did anything.
1888000	1889000	Never said anything bad about you.
1889000	1890000	It could have been anybody but her, too.
1890000	1894000	It would have been funny and also harmless, too, because I feel like, all right, I could
1894000	1895000	have picked anybody.
1895000	1899000	So, yeah, well, it is interesting.
1899000	1904000	We don't have to spend the rest of the time on the actual operation because there's a
1904000	1908000	meeting with the goddess in this Campbell's journey, and then there's an atonement with
1908000	1909000	some shit.
1909000	1910000	As heck?
1910000	1911000	That we have.
1912000	1919000	But there on the table, that is a really important if childish question.
1919000	1926000	Like, how in the hell this thing is like, it's the motor that keeps your body from dying
1926000	1928000	and then they're taking it out?
1928000	1929000	What is it like?
1929000	1930000	What do they do?
1930000	1931000	Do they put the...
1931000	1935000	So, your honor, so my heart was...
1935000	1940000	I was actually, when I got the call for it, I was actually crashing a little bit, so my
1940000	1941000	heart was kind of...
1941000	1944000	It was a lot more heart failure.
1944000	1947000	I think it was borderline being hospitalized the whole time.
1947000	1951000	So, somebody got the call, and you go in there, and my heart was just...
1951000	1956000	I was as nervous as you can be, just what's going on, yada yada, did some calls that
1956000	1961000	I had to make to family, like goodbye or whatever.
1961000	1966000	And they could not sedate me because...
1966000	1975000	Actually, first off, when I got the call, I had to spend the night in the hospital because
1975000	1983000	the donor's family wasn't ready to let go of the body.
1983000	1987000	So, that was an interesting thing to sit there and kind of wait for that.
1987000	1988000	Interesting.
1989000	1990000	Interesting, yeah.
1990000	1994000	You'll fuck with your head a little bit in life and make you realize life a little bit
1994000	1995000	more.
1995000	1996000	And you're like...
1996000	1999000	You're in the same hospital and you get dropped by the doorway and go, listen, I know I'm
1999000	2004000	not entitled to anything, but this isn't a cup of sugar.
2004000	2010000	I've got Blue Cross, I've got Blue Cross, it's all right.
2010000	2013000	So, but just physically, I'm just saying...
2013000	2017000	Yes, you go into a room, they immediately go into the surgery room, there's a machine
2017000	2025000	which looks like a reel-to-reel and it just, after they get the ports into your valves,
2025000	2032000	it's basically redirecting your blood out of your body into like a reel-to-reel to oxygen.
2032000	2035000	Give it oxygen and then...
2035000	2040000	So, there's a machine on the outside that keeps you from dying while they disconnect
2040000	2041000	your heart.
2041000	2043000	While they disconnect, you're out and pull your heart out.
2043000	2046000	And then they put the Indiana Jones, the bag of sand in there.
2046000	2047000	Yeah, yeah, pretty much...
2047000	2052000	So that your body doesn't shoot the arrows, makes sense.
2052000	2056000	And they, you know, there's probably, they're going to adjust the amount of sand depending
2056000	2057000	on the heart.
2057000	2058000	Exactly.
2058000	2063000	Okay, well, so yeah, and we can, I'll Google the rest of that if I'm so goddamn interested
2063000	2068000	because there's things that only you can tell us about, which is like your personal story.
2068000	2072000	Gotta Google it, gotta Google that information.
2073000	2076000	So then, they zip you back up.
2076000	2080000	There's obviously all this terror now that you have this thing, because it's like, oh,
2080000	2084000	there's this percentage of chance that it's just not going to work.
2084000	2086000	Yeah, rejection.
2086000	2089000	And see how the Tinder thing already, thematic?
2089000	2093000	Fear of rejection, the swiping, the cell phone.
2093000	2095000	Come on.
2095000	2097000	It's impressive, I didn't...
2097000	2100000	It's so impressive, I didn't even plan it.
2100000	2104000	And I forced the connection improvisationally and apparently offended you?
2104000	2107000	I don't know.
2107000	2111000	So you're zipped up and you're done, you're recovered.
2111000	2117000	And so then here comes the thing that definitely separates you from everyone in the room, even
2117000	2119000	if someone in here did have a heart transplant.
2119000	2125000	Because then this thing that's not supposed to happen happens, which is that the family...
2126000	2131000	I don't know who, you're never allowed to know who the donor is, who they are.
2131000	2138000	And the family, somehow, the details, I don't know how they figured it out, but the details
2138000	2144000	are really, they were searching a little harder for, I don't know, they were kind of doing
2144000	2145000	their own investigation.
2145000	2151000	They found my brother's website as a painter and he wrote something in the bio of like,
2152000	2156000	oh, my brother with transplant, yada yada, and it just matched up like the San Francisco
2156000	2162000	area, yada yada, and they ended up finding out and contacting my mom.
2162000	2168000	So the family of the guy whose heart's in your chest tracks you down, and so did you
2168000	2170000	hang out with them?
2170000	2176000	To be quite honest, I have never written anything to them or seen them.
2176000	2180000	My mom has, she's talked to them.
2180000	2183000	I don't know, maybe something I should do.
2183000	2185000	Mentally, it's kind of a little hard.
2185000	2186000	What did they want?
2186000	2192000	If they're talking, they went to talk to your family, what were they trying to do in that?
2192000	2195000	They just wanted to see where, you know...
2195000	2196000	Just wanted to see what happened.
2196000	2197000	See what happened, yeah.
2197000	2200000	I'm sorry, I did not know where that was coming from, actually.
2200000	2201000	No, no.
2201000	2203000	No, you were answering shop before when you talked.
2203000	2204000	That's Spencer.
2204000	2205000	Who's talking?
2205000	2206000	Where am I?
2206000	2207000	Sorry, sorry.
2207000	2212000	Just imagine Dan's stomach is talking to you.
2212000	2214000	That's the eye line.
2214000	2215000	Awesome.
2215000	2218000	But no, in answer to your question, to the extent that you're feeling any guilt, I would
2218000	2223000	immediately absolve you of it, as I would any war veteran who...
2223000	2224000	Yeah.
2224000	2225000	I would say follow...
2225000	2230000	Well, I wouldn't say follow your heart, because then you'd groan, and I would...
2230000	2233000	Follow your bliss, follow your comfort, follow your...
2233000	2234000	I mean, there's no...
2234000	2237000	This is all epilogue and whatever you feel like doing...
2237000	2238000	Yeah, I mean...
2238000	2240000	Obviously, they're breaking rules, tracking you down.
2240000	2243000	They're following their fucking impulses there.
2243000	2248000	They're figuring out how to find where all the pieces went.
2248000	2249000	But what's different?
2249000	2251000	What's different in your life now?
2251000	2252000	Did you notice anything?
2252000	2256000	I mean, did you, like, go, you know, I never liked pepperoni before?
2256000	2257000	Yeah, yeah, right.
2257000	2260000	That's a big thing, actually, that happens with transplant people.
2260000	2261000	See?
2261000	2262000	You're shaking your head, really.
2262000	2263000	Because everything...
2263000	2264000	All of your...
2264000	2267000	You're interested in this as purely as a direct-to-video feature for me.
2267000	2270000	I want to see if he's like, oh, I saw a vision.
2270000	2272000	I saw a vision of something.
2272000	2274000	It's just as if I was running through the bush.
2274000	2276000	I got a werewolf's heart.
2276000	2278000	You're a lichen, aren't you?
2278000	2279000	Well, hold on.
2279000	2280000	No, but all of these...
2280000	2281000	Look at that.
2281000	2282000	I can feel.
2282000	2285000	All of these questions are fine, but there's a little more to the story.
2285000	2286000	Okay, well, all right.
2286000	2291000	There's a final little, like, cosmic fucking insane thing.
2291000	2292000	All right, yeah.
2292000	2293000	Okay.
2293000	2295000	Which I don't know where to file and didn't know where to file, and thought you should
2295000	2297000	just come in and share it.
2297000	2302000	So, even though you didn't communicate with them, because they connected with your mom,
2302000	2305000	the information came to you.
2305000	2307000	Yeah, they've seen photos of me.
2307000	2309000	They know, I mean, they sent her emails.
2309000	2312000	So now you know about the donor.
2312000	2313000	Right.
2313000	2316000	And did you do any investigating of your own, or was it just all information that came to
2316000	2317000	you?
2317000	2318000	The information that came to me.
2318000	2319000	I didn't want them.
2319000	2320000	No, anyway.
2320000	2321000	So what did you find out?
2321000	2330640	What I found out, I found out he was from, like, Northern California, and he was 27.
2330640	2331640	I knew that, though.
2331640	2336080	I knew the age of the time when I was getting it.
2336080	2342360	And then I found out how he died, and that was very interesting, and that was basically
2342360	2351760	I found out he just committed suicide, and that was kind of a little hard to hear, because
2351760	2356200	the stories were a little flip-flop of what I don't think people wanted to tell me, and
2356200	2357200	yeah.
2357200	2359200	What do you mean, they didn't want, you don't think, they...
2359200	2366600	Only people want me to know that he took his own life, and it's, I don't know, I mean,
2366600	2370040	it's horrible, but it's something that, like, yeah, that's who...
2371040	2375120	Well, it makes the mind race through so many strange calculations that you never have to
2375120	2382120	perform about what, and I still don't know, what the, all I know is that that's insane.
2382120	2389440	I don't know what it means, really, I don't know if it means, like, oh, good, a person
2389440	2394480	who didn't even want their hearts, they threw it away, and I found it in the garden, or is
2394480	2399320	it like, I mean, no, it's not like that at all, I mean, it's a tough question.
2399320	2406320	I'm, you know, 11 years now, alive, living, and it's always been a struggle, too, like,
2406320	2413280	my heart, like, five pacemakers, all that kind of stuff, and just, yeah, it's, I mean,
2413280	2417880	I'm grateful for it, it's hard to know that that's what happened, but that's kind of,
2417880	2423400	that is, that's life, I guess, too, you know, people choose their own path, and that's,
2423400	2424400	you know, the best choice.
2424400	2429680	Is there, so, another, another dumb question, and then I'll let Rob ask his fun questions.
2429680	2432080	That's fine, that's fine, man.
2432080	2436120	He wants to know if you can jump higher now.
2436120	2440880	I've been able to move one thing real slowly, it's kind of weird, I don't know why, you
2440880	2441880	see the movie Phenomenon?
2441880	2442880	Yeah, it's pretty good.
2442880	2447840	Yes, he wants to know if Denzel Washington can help you fight crime by telling you where
2447840	2449120	the cartel is.
2449120	2450120	Can't wait.
2450520	2453120	Do you feel where a treasure might be?
2458920	2463680	But my one last grounded question, which is a pretty typical one, is just sort of like,
2463680	2469480	well, it's like, like, so, like, all right, so, like, is there some, is there, is there,
2469480	2478360	is there like a psychological or spiritual pressure that comes with?
2479360	2486360	I mean, my mind is a lot more open to a lot of things, and I believe in, I mean, I don't
2486360	2488360	know, psychological mind.
2488360	2492560	I guess, like, do you have, there's survivor's guilt, if you just live through something
2492560	2499560	that people, we never talk about, I don't know if there's donors, donation-receiving
2499560	2504000	guilt about, like, oh, I better do something with this heart, if the guy saw what I just
2504000	2514120	did last night on that date, he'd be like, what are you doing, my heart, and you watched
2514120	2515120	Hudson Hawk?
2515120	2516120	Yeah, why?
2516120	2517120	Why?
2517120	2520400	And you made her watch it, and she told you she didn't like it the first time, and you'd-
2520400	2521400	Why are you a fan of it?
2521400	2522400	Why are you a fan of it?
2522400	2523400	Come on.
2523400	2524400	Get up.
2524400	2529600	Every beat is the one that I didn't get, and you used it to watch Hudson Hawk.
2530600	2534600	I mean, is there anything like that about, like, did your view of your career change?
2534600	2540000	There's a lot of, yeah, a lot of transplant people, there's a lot of guilt around that,
2540000	2546800	I guess, that some people have, and yeah, maybe, I mean, internally, I don't have it
2546800	2552880	on the outside of, like, I feel bad, I don't, I mean, I love the life that was given to
2552880	2559200	me to be here and to be living, so it's not, I don't, I guess I don't really have guilt,
2559200	2560200	you know?
2560200	2563400	I have just, just a lot of the guilt-
2563400	2564400	Prejation.
2564400	2568000	Yeah, a lot of the guilt must go away if you found out he killed himself, like, not to
2568000	2573200	be glimmering or anything, but it's like he literally ended his life so that I could live,
2573200	2574200	I mean, not so that-
2574200	2576200	Right, like with the Hudson Hawk scenario, yeah, when you get that-
2576200	2577200	Yeah, it's like-
2577200	2579200	When you get that cartoonist, yeah, it's like, yeah, you-
2579200	2580200	Yes.
2580200	2585200	Well, I mean, it's better than somebody who wanted to live and got into a car accident.
2585200	2586200	Yeah.
2587200	2589200	No, it worked out pretty great, I think.
2592200	2594200	That's, yeah, I guess so.
2596200	2600200	But you've rolled these thoughts over in your head more than we have, right?
2600200	2601200	All the time.
2601200	2604200	I mean, I could get rejection anytime.
2604200	2606200	Life is really quick.
2606200	2608200	What do you mean by rejection?
2608200	2609200	Like, the heart?
2609200	2611200	My body could reject my heart.
2611200	2612200	Even after 11 years?
2612200	2613200	Potentially.
2613200	2619200	And actually after 10 right now, I'm really, I mean, I'm healthy, I think so.
2619200	2627200	But the body can, yeah, the body eventually can start to reduce, my meds will change it,
2627200	2630200	try to, I don't know, formula drugs to try to keep me alive or-
2630200	2632200	So you have to take drugs to keep-
2632200	2634200	I take a lot of drugs, yeah.
2634200	2639200	So you have white blood cells, I'm sure you all know that, and they attack foreign things
2639200	2642200	in your body, and mine is foreign.
2642200	2649200	They're not attacking it right now, but if they ever feel the urge to, because my meds stop,
2649200	2651200	and yeah, they can do that.
2651200	2655200	Because it's not me, it's not you, it's not a part of your DNA.
2655200	2658200	So, are you at like a Jessica Elba now?
2658200	2662200	You can like see, like, other, like, murderers having-
2662200	2663200	Yeah.
2663200	2664200	Like, I mean-
2664200	2665200	I'm a precog, yeah.
2665200	2667200	Good, good, good.
2667200	2668200	Okay, okay, cool.
2668200	2670200	So, how many ghosts are in the building?
2670200	2673200	Oh, there it is, there it is.
2673200	2676200	Well, all right, yeah, I'm bad at closing things, but-
2676200	2677200	That's fine.
2677200	2686200	I wanted you to come meet the kids, and I wanted to learn about Tinder, and I wanted-
2686200	2690200	Well, there was one thing that you said when we were talking about it, and I was like,
2690200	2693200	you said you don't even get anesthetic when you do the procedure.
2693200	2695200	Oh, Jesus Christ!
2696200	2698200	They didn't put you under, or they couldn't put you under?
2698200	2700200	Well, they couldn't put me under, because my heart was-
2700200	2702200	No, anesthetic, okay, but not- they can't knock you out.
2702200	2705200	They can't knock you all the way out, they have to keep you out like a-
2705200	2706200	I mean, they can't-
2706200	2708200	Are you fucking kidding me?
2708200	2712200	So, they're going, okay, so, here we go.
2712200	2713200	I'm sorry.
2713200	2716200	Yeah, so they do knock you out?
2716200	2720200	Oh, I bet it hurts, but we're almost done, we're almost done.
2720200	2722200	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
2722200	2724200	Almost done, yeah, almost done.
2724200	2725200	Almost done, almost done.
2725200	2728200	One, two, three, oh, okay.
2728200	2731200	Okay, you didn't see that, you know, you're just-
2733200	2736200	That's exactly it, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2738200	2742200	Were you, like, going, hit- there's a chair, hit me with something really hard?
2742200	2745200	Well, they keep that, like, just a happy meeting.
2745200	2748200	I'm like, I'm out, but I can hear things.
2748200	2749200	Oh, fuck!
2749200	2750200	I'm making like-
2751200	2753200	Oh, my God.
2753200	2757200	I am, and then your heart does have to stop for a minute,
2757200	2759200	and there's that episode that they're always-
2759200	2762200	So, you heard your old heart stop?
2762200	2764200	No, I didn't hear it.
2764200	2765200	Oh, okay.
2767200	2769200	You feel it, though, you know?
2769200	2770200	You feel it, I mean-
2770200	2771200	You felt it?
2771200	2774200	Well, you feel certain things, or you kind of, you-
2774200	2776200	I mean, you go somewhere else, you know?
2776200	2778200	You kind of like, you just, yeah.
2778200	2780200	I'm so bummed out, right?
2781200	2783200	Life stuff, you know?
2784200	2786200	But you said- there was a point, and I can't remember where it was,
2786200	2789200	because as they were putting-
2789200	2794200	There was a line that you had,
2794200	2796200	because I asked you, like, what was the last thing you said
2796200	2799200	before the procedure started, or something like that.
2799200	2800200	Do you remember what I'm talking about?
2800200	2802200	Yeah, I do, yeah.
2803200	2804200	I'm just exploiting you, but-
2804200	2805200	Fuck you, yeah, that's fine.
2805200	2807200	You totally are, you fucking are.
2807200	2811200	I just was yelling out, I don't want to die.
2811200	2812200	I don't want to die, yeah.
2812200	2815200	And that was- with my mom and my sister,
2815200	2818200	and that was- and they were willing me into the room,
2818200	2821200	and that was my last words to them, and that was pretty much-
2821200	2824200	But you feel- it's funny, because when you were talking about it,
2824200	2825200	I was like, immediately-
2825200	2830200	There's a shame we associate with that.
2830200	2833200	Like, none of us wants to be caught
2833200	2835200	any more than we want to be caught masturbating
2835200	2836200	or taking a shit.
2836200	2839200	We don't want to be caught saying, I don't want to die, right?
2839200	2843200	We look at it as like this thing that, oh, well, that-
2843200	2845200	And it's so strange, because it's the-
2845200	2848200	I mean, well, shitting and jerking off, it kind of unites us.
2848200	2851200	We all have to do it, right?
2851200	2854200	And I don't know, it's just like, I don't want to die.
2854200	2858200	It's very, very underappreciated as a very profound statement.
2858200	2859200	Yeah, it is, yeah.
2859200	2861200	The thing that leopards can't say.
2861200	2864200	You'll never hear it from a fucking giraffe, that's for sure.
2865200	2868200	If giraffes could talk, all they'd say is, now I can reach an apple.
2868200	2870200	That's so proud of myself.
2870200	2872200	I did it, Mom, I did it, I did it.
2872200	2876200	Only we would ever say, I don't want to die, even though nothing does.
2876200	2881200	I think it's human, it's in our- we're animals, we're something, it's in our DNA, you know?
2881200	2886200	I mean, yeah, and I've been through so much, and I don't want to die, you know?
2886200	2891200	And I've been clinically dead a few times, and it's like, yeah, it's-
2892200	2894200	I love the people around me, I love to live.
2894200	2899200	And there was a dude somewhere that, for whatever reason, he did one.
2899200	2900200	And I'm fortunate for it.
2900200	2906200	And it's fantastic that some geniuses were able to use a part of him to create your wish.
2906200	2908200	It's really fucking incredible.
2908200	2911200	Yeah, my surgery was supposed to be five hours, and it was ten hours long.
2911200	2913200	I lost a ton of blood, a lot of things.
2913200	2918200	My heart was swelled over, it was definitely a long ordeal.
2918200	2920200	Did they try to convince you it was your fault?
2921200	2922200	It took ten hours.
2922200	2924200	You know, you really got to calm down.
2929200	2933200	So you were half awake for ten hours.
2933200	2934200	I mean, I was out.
2934200	2936200	They're not talking to me, you know?
2936200	2939200	No, they're probably hoping- they're ignoring you.
2939200	2942200	If they look you in the eye, they'd be like, oh, man.
2944200	2946200	Oh, by the way, did you hear that?
2946200	2950200	I mean, you're not allowed to- the donor, the guy that performs the actual surgery,
2950200	2955200	unlike all the other surgeries anyone's ever had, like the doctor doesn't meet you.
2955200	2957200	You never see his face, you never know his name, right?
2957200	2958200	No, yeah, yeah.
2958200	2959200	Why is that?
2959200	2960200	Why is that?
2960200	2963200	They don't want that human contact, I guess.
2963200	2964200	Oh, okay.
2964200	2965200	Yeah, I've watched The Nick.
2965200	2966200	I know what you're talking about.
2966200	2967200	I see that.
2968200	2972200	I think that's interesting, too, that the guys that do the- and the ladies,
2972200	2978200	god damn it, Harmon, the geniuses that really- whose fingers are the most precise
2978200	2987200	and who really know how to do this top-of-the-line bomb squad thing in a human body,
2987200	2993200	they actually, if you go up the tiers enough, they're the same as executioners.
2993200	2995200	They wear masks and they-
2995200	2998200	They have to have a separation, otherwise they would probably blow their brains off.
2998200	3001200	Because all they want to think about is the math and the fucking-
3001200	3003200	They just don't want that connection.
3003200	3006200	Like, you know, he was a great kid, a great girl.
3006200	3011200	They also- I mean, isn't it more to the point that they probably- isn't it about the outcome, too?
3011200	3014200	They don't want to know what happens to you after you leave.
3014200	3015200	Right, yeah.
3015200	3016200	They want to just walk away from it.
3016200	3019200	They want to go to the next one because they want to be thinking about something they read about you
3019200	3021200	while they're working on someone else.
3021200	3023200	They'll read about me here.
3023200	3024200	Pretty nice.
3024200	3033200	All right, well, let's all give Kyle a warm thank you for opening himself up
3033200	3039200	and sharing his heart with us.
3039200	3040200	Thank you.
3040200	3041200	Thank you.
3041200	3042200	Is there anything-
3042200	3044200	Oh, you have that thing you wanted to plug.
3044200	3045200	He's also doing a one-man show.
3045200	3046200	No, no, no.
3046200	3047200	No, no, no.
3047200	3049200	I mean, is there anything as long as you're-
3049200	3052200	because I just called you by your first name because I figured you're not a stand-up,
3052200	3053200	you're not a-
3053200	3054200	Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
3054200	3055200	Plug anything?
3055200	3056200	I don't know.
3056200	3058200	When you were clinically dead-
3058200	3060200	There's a lot of that.
3060200	3063200	So, how many times were you clinically dead?
3063200	3064200	Jesus.
3064200	3066200	Here we go again.
3066200	3067200	Three.
3067200	3068200	Three?
3068200	3069200	I think three.
3069200	3070200	I think three times.
3070200	3071200	Three, all right.
3071200	3073200	So, Ben Franklin?
3073200	3078200	He was clinically finishing the segment and he saw the other side.
3078200	3085200	He was going into the light and then you've pulled him back to a cold room where-
3085200	3088200	You saw no more, man.
3088200	3090200	I nailed it.
3090200	3091200	I did a four-point landing.
3091200	3092200	They applauded.
3092200	3098200	He grabbed his hat and you have more Roger Corman questions.
3098200	3099200	Come on, man.
3099200	3101200	I'm supposed to undercut you.
3101200	3103200	This is my job.
3103200	3106200	I don't know where you read that.
3107200	3110200	Between the lines.
3110200	3119200	Well, anyways, thank you again, Kyle, for coming and sharing your self-opening heart sharing.
3119200	3120200	Remember that?
3120200	3121200	More than one thing.
3121200	3123200	I'm just going to play it.
3123200	3124200	I brew beer.
3124200	3127200	If you all love beer, I'm trying to start a beer bar.
3127200	3130200	So, yeah, hopefully one day I'll get that going.
3130200	3131200	All right.
3131200	3132200	Well, let me know-
3132200	3133200	Yeah, let us know.
3133200	3134200	You know how to get in contact with us.
3135200	3142200	When the grand opening is, we'll do our version of Kickstarter, which is we'll all get drunk at your bar.
3142200	3143200	I got a brewer, probably.
3143200	3144200	So, yeah, we'll brew beer.
3144200	3145200	Is it going to have a clever name?
3145200	3148200	Like the Aortic?
3148200	3150200	Now who's Roger Corman?
3150200	3151200	All right.
3151200	3152200	All right.
3152200	3153200	Who's ready?
3153200	3154200	Guys coming up with log lines.
3154200	3156200	The sleeve behind the sleeve of the door.
3156200	3157200	I don't know.
3157200	3158200	All right.
3158200	3159200	Thanks, Kyle.
3159200	3162200	We'll check back in with him at some point.
3164200	3170200	Dan, have you ever had surgery?
3170200	3171200	I had a biopsy.
3171200	3172200	I got this.
3172200	3173200	Ugh, gross.
3173200	3179200	How manyopsies did you buy?
3179200	3180200	That was stupid.
3180200	3183200	How good of a friend are you that you don't know about your-
3183200	3184200	I knew it.
3184200	3186200	I was setting you up to talk about it.
3186200	3187200	I knew about it.
3187200	3193200	How good of a friend of you that didn't come to my birthday or say happy birthday?
3193200	3200200	Kissing Dan Gooderman on Twitter and you don't say happy birthday and you get no text?
3200200	3204200	Well, you're always hanging out with your Lego friends.
3204200	3207200	That's why we text each other.
3207200	3209200	We love each other.
3209200	3218200	Well, I, you know, when he was talking about how could you reject something after 11 years?
3218200	3220200	It's in your chest.
3220200	3226200	I was thinking about you, man, and how possible it is to-
3226200	3227200	No.
3227200	3230200	No, no, no.
3230200	3236200	Well, I think- I don't know about you, but I think this is a very interesting podcast I've put together.
3236200	3238200	I think you're doing a really good job.
3238200	3239200	No, no, no.
3239200	3240200	It's a mellow one.
3240200	3241200	I don't need it.
3241200	3243200	It's its own reward.
3243200	3244200	It's a mellow one.
3244200	3245200	All right.
3245200	3246200	So-
3246200	3249200	I get paid in fun.
3249200	3250200	All right.
3250200	3254200	Spencer, talk about the Chinese or ISIS or-
3254200	3258200	So you guys have heard about these murder vans, right?
3258200	3259200	No.
3259200	3261200	Murder vans?
3261200	3262200	Murder vans?
3262200	3263200	Oh, yeah.
3263200	3266200	Is that like the legend of beggar vans?
3266200	3267200	It's just this-
3267200	3268200	Oh, God.
3268200	3269200	All right.
3269200	3270200	I knew it.
3270200	3271200	Okay.
3271200	3272200	Shit.
3272200	3273200	I knew I shouldn't-
3273200	3274200	The white blood cells are getting suspicious.
3274200	3275200	I know.
3275200	3276200	I know.
3276200	3277200	I know.
3277200	3278200	I know.
3278200	3279200	It's nice to be here tonight.
3279200	3280200	I knew it.
3280200	3281200	I knew it.
3281200	3282200	I knew it.
3282200	3283200	It was nice of you.
3283200	3284200	Oh, I know what we need to talk about.
3284200	3285200	Okay.
3285200	3286200	So-
3286200	3287200	Okay.
3287200	3288200	I'm so sorry.
3288200	3289200	So every once in a while, it appears we have to keep reminding you what a monopoly guy
3289200	3291200	is in screenwriting.
3291200	3293200	Oh, yeah.
3293200	3294200	Oh.
3294200	3295200	Oh, okay.
3295200	3297200	I thought that's how I'm going to die.
3297200	3301200	It's like the end of a garb.
3301200	3307200	It's always- that's that person you least expect.
3307200	3308200	It was nice.
3308200	3319200	It was- thank you for doing us the- it was- you did do me a favor.
3319200	3322200	He said, I'll do it if you're in a jam.
3322200	3323200	I said, I am in a jam.
3323200	3324200	Or why would I be like asking?
3324200	3327200	In a jam.
3327200	3331200	I haven't had my vitamins today.
3331200	3333200	What vitamins do you take?
3333200	3334200	That excites me.
3334200	3335200	I take-
3336200	3339200	In order to do the bit, I had to be off mic.
3339200	3343200	I said, vitamin C.
3343200	3349200	God damn it.
3349200	3351200	Vitamin C.
3351200	3353200	I know what it is.
3353200	3355200	I'm just shocked.
3355200	3356200	I know what you were-
3356200	3359200	I know that's what those Lego people run on.
3359200	3361200	Nine movies?
3361200	3362200	Come on.
3362200	3364200	They're Legos.
3364200	3366200	Knock the Coke off over there.
3366200	3368200	Couple too many Lego movies coming out.
3368200	3370200	They're cocaine.
3370200	3373200	They're not- they don't call them Legos.
3373200	3374200	Lego bricks.
3374200	3375200	Thank you.
3377200	3378200	So the Monopoly guys.
3378200	3380200	So the reason why we're bringing this up-
3380200	3382200	I don't want to have to keep explaining this to you young screenwriters.
3382200	3387200	I mean you're basing this off of me who saw a commercial.
3387200	3392200	Let's verify it first because I might be wrong because I haven't seen the movie.
3392200	3393200	The movie Sisters?
3394200	3396200	Is there a Monopoly guy and sisters?
3396200	3397200	Oh, there's a Monopoly guy and sisters.
3397200	3399200	What's the Monopoly guy and sisters?
3399200	3400200	I haven't seen it.
3400200	3403200	There's a woman wearing a big belt and they're like,
3403200	3405200	oh, I had to have a good time at the championship.
3405200	3406200	And she's like, what?
3406200	3409200	Where you won the belt at because you're a wrestler.
3409200	3411200	I did the joke bad.
3411200	3412200	But yeah.
3412200	3414200	But that is a Monopoly guy.
3414200	3415200	Yeah, no, it's a Monopoly guy.
3415200	3416200	If you go, holy cow.
3416200	3420200	If you have a movie or whatever-
3420200	3423200	Do we want to say the origin of the Monopoly guy?
3423200	3424200	Yeah, yeah.
3424200	3426200	Just to remind you of new time listeners,
3426200	3430200	Monopoly guy is named after the moment in Ace Ventura 2
3430200	3434200	when Jim Carrey is about to let a guy have it
3434200	3436200	and he's wearing it.
3436200	3438200	He's dressed like the Monopoly guy.
3438200	3439200	He's bald.
3439200	3441200	He's got a mustache, a monocle.
3441200	3442200	He's in a tux.
3442200	3445200	And the guy says, oh, I don't like people who talk to animals
3445200	3447200	and make faces.
3447200	3449200	And Jim Carrey goes, I'm sorry.
3449200	3450200	I'm sorry.
3450200	3451200	We haven't met.
3451200	3453200	You must be the Monopoly guy.
3453200	3455200	And it's like, it's a joke.
3455200	3458200	But the problem is with a Monopoly guy,
3458200	3460200	and it's very clever as it turns out
3460200	3463200	because you're kind of holding a Monopoly over all of reality
3463200	3467200	and it's not really fair that you're profiting a laugh,
3467200	3469200	which you really aren't.
3469200	3475200	So then you, my friends, my Asperger's flock,
3475200	3478200	you know, I always qualify this by saying like,
3478200	3480200	because for you guys, because you'll be tweeting me,
3480200	3482200	well, isn't the Monopoly guy all comedy
3482200	3484200	because Andrew always contriving everything?
3484200	3487200	Actually, actually, actually, actually.
3487200	3490200	No, we're not talking about it is or it isn't.
3490200	3491200	We're talking about a thing.
3491200	3494200	It's like, well, unnecessary roughness in football.
3494200	3495200	I mean, what is it?
3495200	3496200	Well, I've right now.
3496200	3500200	I'm just saying it's a concept.
3500200	3502200	It's like there's, you know, there's places
3502200	3504200	where lines are clearly crossed.
3504200	3508200	So the Monopoly guy, the actual Monopoly guy one is one.
3508200	3509200	Don't do that.
3509200	3512200	Back then it was then water boy with Adam Sandler.
3512200	3515200	The guy walks in and he's dressed like Colonel Sanders.
3515200	3516200	All right, Colonel Sanders.
3516200	3517200	And it's like supposed to be a laugh,
3517200	3518200	but it was a scene closer.
3518200	3519200	It's not fair.
3519200	3520200	It's a Monopoly guy.
3520200	3521200	You can't do it.
3521200	3522200	You're not allowed to do it.
3522200	3523200	You can't do it.
3523200	3524200	You can't dress a guy up exactly like Colonel Sanders
3524200	3526200	and go zing.
3526200	3528200	You look like Colonel Sanders.
3528200	3529200	It's cheating.
3529200	3530200	You can't.
3530200	3532200	You can't dress a guy like Colonel Sanders.
3532200	3535200	And now I'm going like, hi, I know what you're thinking.
3535200	3536200	I'm dressed like Colonel Sanders.
3536200	3537200	But here's the thing.
3537200	3539200	Like you could throw it away and keep moving
3539200	3542200	and do more with this character.
3542200	3544200	Just like let him be dressed like Colonel Sanders.
3544200	3546200	Call him Colonel Sanders.
3546200	3547200	Have that be the character's name.
3547200	3548200	I don't care.
3548200	3550200	I'm not here to tell you what to do.
3550200	3552200	I'm here to tell you stop doing that one thing.
3552200	3553200	Right.
3553200	3556200	And the reason I tell you again is because according to Rob,
3556200	3559200	this is a preliminary Monopoly guy alert,
3559200	3563200	code orange, because it's based on a trailer clip,
3563200	3564200	TV commercial.
3564200	3565200	What's the new...
3565200	3567200	Christmas with the fartings.
3567200	3568200	No, no, no.
3568200	3570200	The new Seth Rogen movie.
3570200	3571200	Right.
3571200	3573200	That was my guess at the title.
3573200	3574200	The Night Before.
3574200	3575200	The Night Before.
3575200	3576200	Anybody see the trailer for it?
3576200	3578200	Oh, the movie's bad.
3578200	3582200	I'm not here to qualify whether the movie is good or not.
3582200	3584200	I hear actually it's pretty good, but...
3584200	3586200	It's extremely beautiful.
3586200	3587200	But didn't...
3587200	3588200	I heard it.
3588200	3589200	I didn't see it.
3589200	3595200	We could talk after the show, but in the trailer, isn't there...
3595200	3601200	Seth Rogen is talking to two little girls who are twins,
3601200	3607200	who are in like a blue little dresses and like pigtails,
3607200	3608200	and he says...
3608200	3609200	What does he say?
3609200	3611200	The sum of both the shining.
3611200	3612200	He says, oh, okay.
3612200	3617200	Hey, you know, you guys are from the shining or something?
3617200	3618200	Something like that.
3618200	3619200	Monopoly guy.
3619200	3620200	They said, you look weird.
3620200	3622200	He said, have you ever seen the shining?
3622200	3623200	Yeah.
3623200	3624200	You can't...
3624200	3625200	Damn.
3625200	3626200	Can't do it.
3626200	3627200	I'm a fan of...
3627200	3628200	Maybe it's a great movie.
3628200	3629200	Can't do that.
3629200	3630200	I'm a fan of everybody...
3630200	3631200	That's not a joke.
3631200	3633200	I'm a fan of everybody involved, but it's cheating,
3633200	3638200	because if you write in the script two girls that are dressed
3638200	3644200	like the twins in the shining, Seth Rogen says,
3644200	3647200	have you seen the shining?
3647200	3648200	That's cheating.
3648200	3649200	It's cheating.
3649200	3650200	You're cheating.
3650200	3651200	You're cheating.
3651200	3652200	You're being a bully.
3652200	3653200	You're being a bully, I think.
3653200	3654200	You're being a bully.
3654200	3655200	You're bullying.
3655200	3656200	You're monopolizing.
3656200	3658200	If I know I can...
3658200	3659200	You're being...
3659200	3663200	What is that in pool where you're pretending you're being bad?
3663200	3664200	A hustler.
3664200	3665200	A hustler.
3665200	3666200	You're being a hustler.
3666200	3667200	You're like, oh, man, shit.
3667200	3670200	I don't know if I'm going to be able to score this one.
3670200	3672200	It's just like, all right.
3672200	3676200	Well, you know, if you don't do it, I'll give you 20 bucks.
3676200	3677200	Okay.
3677200	3678200	I did it.
3678200	3679200	All right.
3679200	3680200	Okay.
3680200	3681200	It's cheating.
3681200	3682200	Yeah, yeah.
3682200	3683200	It's cheating.
3683200	3684200	You're being a comedy hustler.
3684200	3685200	We can't go to...
3685200	3686200	We're not allowed on that set.
3686200	3687200	We can't go there and tell these guys what to do.
3687200	3688200	They're very successful.
3688200	3690200	Whoever's writing that movie, they're doing a great job.
3690200	3691200	Seth Rogen's...
3691200	3692200	Seth Rogen's...
3692200	3693200	Seth Rogen's...
3693200	3695200	If I showed up, I'd be shot.
3695200	3697200	So I'm starting here.
3697200	3699200	I'm starting here where the problem starts.
3699200	3700200	25-year-old kids in Los Angeles.
3700200	3702200	You came out here from your turnip farms,
3702200	3705200	and you got big dreams, and you admire me.
3705200	3706200	And you're like, I want to do what he did.
3706200	3707200	Yeah, yeah.
3707200	3708200	From Milwaukee to L.A.
3708200	3710200	I want to build myself from dirt without permission.
3710200	3711200	Like Dan Harmon did.
3711200	3712200	I want to, yeah.
3712200	3714200	I want to show you Chase's voicemails,
3714200	3716200	and I'm going to be on TMZ,
3716200	3718200	and everyone's going to respect me,
3718200	3720200	because I'm a really respectable person.
3720200	3721200	Get rid of them turnips.
3721200	3722200	No more turnips for me.
3722200	3723200	Yeah.
3723200	3724200	I don't want any turnips.
3724200	3725200	And so I'm telling you, well, fine.
3725200	3726200	Yeah, come to my podcast.
3726200	3728200	First of all, it's 10 bucks at the door.
3728200	3731200	Pretty high price, considering.
3731200	3732200	That's for them.
3732200	3733200	They got to...
3733200	3735200	It costs money to make a room that's hot.
3735200	3737200	My thing that is...
3737200	3740200	My thing that is with the Monopoly guys,
3740200	3741200	when did...
3741200	3742200	When did...
3742200	3743200	The first time I noticed the Monopoly guy
3743200	3746200	was the origin of Monopoly guy in Ace Ventura,
3746200	3747200	which came out when?
3747200	3748200	Like 90...
3748200	3751200	This is pre-pulp fiction laughs.
3751200	3753200	Yeah, we were still in theaters with kids
3753200	3754200	making them laugh with farts and stuff.
3754200	3755200	I know. We were kids.
3755200	3756200	We were kids.
3756200	3758200	And it's still happening.
3758200	3759200	It's still happening.
3759200	3760200	People are still doing Monopoly guys.
3760200	3761200	You guys stop it.
3761200	3762200	Don't do Monopoly guys.
3762200	3763200	It's cheating.
3763200	3764200	You're millennials.
3764200	3765200	You're into stopping things.
3765200	3767200	Stop that.
3767200	3768200	Stop bad comedy.
3768200	3771200	Or at least set it up, do Monopoly guy,
3771200	3774200	and then undercut it with some kind of...
3774200	3775200	Chicken 90 degrees.
3775200	3776200	Yeah.
3776200	3777200	Do a peer-to-peer Monopoly guy,
3777200	3778200	where there is no Monopoly,
3778200	3780200	where everyone just does their own comedy
3780200	3782200	for each other on an app.
3782200	3784200	I'm not going to bitch about that.
3785200	3787200	I haven't seen the movie, but...
3787200	3788200	I need a movie.
3788200	3789200	Who needs a movie?
3789200	3790200	Have you seen The Shining?
3790200	3791200	I need to laugh,
3791200	3792200	and then someone comes to your house
3792200	3793200	and shouts up at the thing.
3793200	3796200	What if a guy was dressed like a leopard?
3796200	3797200	I don't know.
3799200	3800200	Okay, cool.
3801200	3802200	Five stars, please.
3802200	3803200	How could you...
3803200	3805200	Okay, I haven't seen the movie,
3805200	3809200	but if the little girls were going,
3809200	3810200	you're weird,
3810200	3811200	and he goes,
3811200	3812200	have you seen The Shining?
3812200	3813200	And they would say,
3813200	3816200	why do you think we're dressed exactly like these two girls
3816200	3817200	from The Shining?
3817200	3818200	We're the biggest fans.
3818200	3819200	And then, like, you know,
3819200	3821200	the dad comes in with an ax, like, going,
3821200	3823200	hey, have you seen our favorite movie?
3825200	3827200	And then he goes...
3827200	3829200	And then Seth Rogen goes,
3829200	3831200	no, but have you seen The Shining?
3831200	3833200	Yes, we have.
3833200	3835200	See, that's why my daughters are just like this,
3835200	3837200	and I'm dressed like Jack Nicholson,
3837200	3838200	and then all of a sudden,
3838200	3839200	Scat Man comes in going,
3839200	3840200	ah!
3840200	3841200	And they're like, I don't believe this.
3841200	3843200	You guys lured me in.
3843200	3845200	You waited for me to make them an actually guy
3845200	3847200	by The Shining joke.
3847200	3849200	You guys have really seen The Shining.
3849200	3851200	You've totally seen The Shining.
3851200	3852200	Yes.
3852200	3853200	And then he would turn around,
3853200	3856200	and then The Shining's actually playing on the TV.
3856200	3857200	And then he's like,
3857200	3858200	one thing, though,
3858200	3859200	because you had twins,
3859200	3861200	and they're like, they're not twins.
3861200	3865200	And then they bought a series of black and white photos
3865200	3868200	of the most horrific do-it-yourself surgery.
3869200	3872200	And then he looks really close at one of the kids' faces,
3872200	3873200	and it's like, oh my God, yeah,
3873200	3877200	there's just like flaps of badly sewn-together skin.
3877200	3878200	And it's fucked up.
3878200	3881200	And they keep pushing in and dissolving and dissolving,
3881200	3883200	and then it's Seth Rogen at the end going...
3889200	3890200	Credits?
3891200	3892200	Yeah.
3892200	3894200	Maybe, yeah, do that instead.
3894200	3898200	Stanley Kubrick shot the moon landing.
3900200	3902200	Well, yeah, and he confessed to it
3902200	3905200	in the form of many hidden things in The Shining.
3905200	3908200	Apollo T-shirt on...
3908200	3909200	Sure, sure.
3909200	3910200	Danny Boyle.
3910200	3912200	Or your schizophrenic.
3912200	3914200	And you watched The Shining.
3915200	3916200	You decide.
3917200	3919200	You guys have really seen The Shining.
3919200	3921200	You guys have really seen The Shining.
3921200	3922200	All right.
3922200	3923200	Have you seen my friend...
3923200	3926200	Make fun of Ridley, the Monopoly guy.
3926200	3927200	My name...
3927200	3930200	Fred and his wife Wilma are coming over.
3930200	3933200	And a guy comes in with an orange shirt with spots on it
3933200	3936200	and a blue tie, and he's kind of fat.
3936200	3937200	You know?
3937200	3939200	That's a Monopoly guy.
3939200	3941200	Remember the documentary for...
3941200	3944200	Or like the Behind the Music thing for...
3944200	3945200	Never mind.
3945200	3946200	Never mind.
3946200	3948200	For Weird Al Yankovic, and it was like...
3948200	3950200	And then Flea did an interview, and they were like,
3950200	3951200	what did you...
3951200	3952200	He's like, I don't know.
3952200	3955200	I like his songs, but the one he did for us,
3955200	3957200	yeah, but do you now?
3957200	3958200	Do you think that's funny?
3958200	3959200	I don't think that's funny.
3959200	3960200	Yeah.
3960200	3961200	I like it, Flea.
3961200	3962200	He turned it back on the interview.
3962200	3963200	It was off camera.
3963200	3965200	He's like, I don't think it was funny.
3965200	3966200	What did you think?
3974200	3976200	Are you paying attention right now, sir?
3976200	3979200	No, I'm shooting an E behind the music.
3980200	3981200	Package.
3981200	3983200	The interviewer wasn't mic'd.
3983200	3984200	He was just listening.
3984200	3986200	He was just like, oh, okay.
3986200	3988200	Well, that's a good point.
3988200	3989200	But I thought that was a good move.
3989200	3990200	I learned that from Flea.
3990200	3995200	Remember when we were thinking about moving my garage nine feet
3995200	3996200	to the right?
3996200	3997200	Oh, yeah.
3997200	3999200	So making it bigger or something?
3999200	4001200	I mean, that still may be something.
4001200	4002200	And then the guy came, and he was like,
4002200	4003200	okay, so here's the thing.
4003200	4004200	And then there was this whole estimate.
4004200	4005200	And I was like...
4005200	4006200	And then, but it was like...
4006200	4008200	And then the Flea showed up, and he was like,
4008200	4009200	oh, the Flea showed up.
4009200	4011200	I drum stuff.
4011200	4013200	He's a drummer, right?
4013200	4016200	And he went, come on, Harmon.
4016200	4017200	Are you chicken?
4021200	4024200	Oh, you always know, Harmon hates it
4024200	4026200	when you call him chicken.
4028200	4031200	Right now, we haven't ever heard that before.
4031200	4033200	It's going to make him publicly declare
4033200	4037200	your two and three sucked in on documentary about it.
4037200	4039200	As far as today's concerned,
4039200	4041200	I know we never mentioned it before,
4041200	4043200	but when Harmon is called chicken,
4043200	4046200	he just can't handle it.
4046200	4047200	Especially when it's late.
4047200	4049200	It'll make anything happen.
4049200	4050200	Don't do it.
4050200	4052200	Yeah, I said in that documentary about Back to the Future
4052200	4054200	that one of the notable things about what a great movie
4054200	4056200	Back to the Future is, is that it breaks so many rules,
4056200	4059200	including the fact that Marty McFly is not really a very...
4059200	4060200	He's not a flawed protagonist.
4060200	4062200	He's like a very willing hero.
4062200	4063200	He doesn't refuse a lot of calls.
4063200	4065200	He charges across the threshold, blah, blah, blah.
4066200	4067200	A lot of tweets from a lot of people
4067200	4070200	with a very deep relationship with that entire trilogy.
4070200	4071200	He did.
4071200	4073200	Like people who, honestly,
4073200	4075200	sometimes your relationship with a movie,
4075200	4076200	you know, it needs to...
4076200	4078200	You need to recognize that your feelings
4078200	4080200	about Muppet Treasure Island
4080200	4083200	have less to do with just cinema
4083200	4084200	and more to do with what was happening
4084200	4087200	at the time the movie came out for you.
4089200	4091200	You know, it's important to recognize
4091200	4093200	objectively masterful pieces of cinema,
4093200	4094200	and it's important that...
4094200	4095200	Robocop.
4098200	4099200	You know, yeah.
4099200	4100200	I don't like Robocop because...
4100200	4102200	Better than Die Hard, and Die Hard's fucking awesome.
4102200	4103200	Anyways.
4104200	4107200	But like, and then, you know, people tweeting me
4107200	4108200	and going like, what about the chicken thing?
4108200	4110200	I'm like, what about the chicken thing?
4110200	4111200	Let's get so angry at you kids.
4111200	4113200	It's just like, is it the chicken thing?
4113200	4114200	I'll put it with the chicken thing.
4114200	4117200	But how amazing is it that that guy,
4117200	4119200	that guy, the conspiracy theories guy,
4119200	4122200	when he's like, he loves so much about the...
4122200	4123200	He knows so many details.
4123200	4125200	He can see a 9-11 in anything,
4125200	4127200	but he clearly doesn't know anything
4127200	4128200	about Back to the Future.
4128200	4130200	No, no, he combines the two and three.
4130200	4132200	He's like, yeah, that's the thing.
4132200	4133200	It's Marty McFly, and he's like,
4133200	4134200	we've got no needles in the thing.
4134200	4137200	And it's like, dude, you're talking about the second movie.
4137200	4138200	You're talking about a conspiracy theory.
4138200	4141200	Go watch the movie with your whole brain.
4141200	4146200	Your 9-11 hunt is costing you joy.
4146200	4147200	This is a good movie.
4147200	4149200	It's about a time traveler.
4152200	4154200	I mean, he's like as into the Oolala magazine
4154200	4157200	as he is into the fucking DeLorean.
4157200	4160200	The guy that did the Oolala?
4160200	4162200	Oolala?
4162200	4164200	Oolala?
4164200	4166200	Oolala?
4166200	4169200	Yeah, half the dialogue from Back to the Future 2.
4169200	4170200	Yeah.
4170200	4173200	Oolala?
4173200	4178200	I actually ran into this guy that landed in L.A. from New York,
4178200	4181200	ran into one of the guys that shot that documentary,
4181200	4186200	which is, the documentary is successful.
4186200	4188200	What documentary are you talking about?
4188200	4189200	It's back in time.
4189200	4190200	It's called Back in Time.
4190200	4191200	You're in this documentary.
4191200	4192200	Yes.
4192200	4193200	Oh, that's why you don't call me in.
4193200	4196200	The Back to the Future 2 and 3 are bad.
4196200	4201200	I didn't know you were in a documentary about anything.
4201200	4204200	I don't make them all.
4204200	4206200	We got sidetracked.
4206200	4210200	I haven't seen you in a while.
4210200	4214200	The last time I saw you was here.
4214200	4216200	Wolves.
4216200	4219200	I'm getting older, Dan.
4219200	4220200	This is what I do.
4220200	4222200	My life is my work.
4222200	4223200	I know.
4223200	4224200	I know.
4224200	4225200	My output.
4225200	4226200	Yours too.
4226200	4227200	Cats in the cradle.
4227200	4232200	You're going to Australia for 90 years.
4232200	4233200	Vancouver.
4233200	4234200	Vancouver.
4234200	4235200	Oh man.
4235200	4238200	Oh man, bait and switch.
4239200	4242200	I've been telling you this since the beginning of the year.
4242200	4244200	You said it was probably maybe going to be Vancouver,
4244200	4246200	but originally it was Australia.
4246200	4248200	That was like five minutes.
4248200	4251200	I've told you it's Vancouver.
4251200	4254200	I'm going to Vancouver next year.
4254200	4255200	For how long?
4255200	4257200	About a year and a half.
4257200	4258200	That's a long time.
4258200	4259200	What?
4259200	4262200	Yeah, you better soak me up while you can and return some text.
4262200	4264200	Hang out with me.
4264200	4267200	Camille hangs out with me.
4267200	4269200	Does he?
4269200	4271200	Yeah, we all hung out.
4271200	4272200	We all hung out.
4272200	4273200	I invited you.
4273200	4276200	Nobody showed up to that.
4276200	4277200	I saw the text chain.
4277200	4278200	Nobody came.
4278200	4279200	No, no, no.
4279200	4280200	Camille came over.
4280200	4281200	Emily came over.
4281200	4283200	Mike Tilly and Steve Age came over.
4283200	4284200	We had a blast.
4284200	4288200	I'm going to share with the kids the kinds of text
4288200	4291200	that you think you deserve a response to.
4291200	4293200	Why did I?
4293200	4299200	This could be bad.
4299200	4302200	Don't get me fired.
4302200	4307200	Don't get me fired for my job hanging on to by a thread.
4307200	4312200	Well, this is just a picture of a medical.
4312200	4318200	This is just a dick with the vast difference.
4318200	4322200	In case you forgot what it looks like.
4322200	4325200	But that's on the heels of you.
4325200	4328200	No, I'm sharing this because you did it.
4328200	4331200	You're going to make me look really bad.
4331200	4334200	That's private.
4334200	4337200	Those are the texts I respond to.
4337200	4344200	You reminded me that our friend was dead out of nowhere.
4344200	4346200	I was feeling sentimental.
4346200	4347200	I missed you.
4347200	4350200	I heard, and he said, heard what?
4351200	4352200	That he's dead.
4352200	4354200	And he said, shit, that's right.
4354200	4355200	You're the one that texted it.
4355200	4357200	And he said, shit, that's right.
4357200	4359200	And I said, well, he's in a better place.
4359200	4363200	And that's when I got the fucking dick pic.
4363200	4374200	So, fool me 800 times.
4374200	4377200	It's a cry for help, man.
4377200	4382200	It's like Lego people taking shits.
4382200	4385200	Blow drying your dog in slow motion.
4385200	4387200	Yeah, that's a good one.
4387200	4389200	That's a good one.
4389200	4391200	No, I wish we had, you know.
4391200	4393200	Got a lot of hits.
4393200	4396200	We could be like Tosh.0 up in this mug.
4396200	4397200	We should.
4397200	4399200	You could blue screen that.
4399200	4401200	You did share with me.
4401200	4403200	You got a little bit of trouble because when you were up here.
4403200	4404200	Don't, don't, don't.
4404200	4405200	You want me to even bring that up?
4405200	4406200	I don't want to bring that up.
4406200	4407200	Yeah, OK.
4407200	4409200	It's still repairing.
4409200	4410200	Don't.
4410200	4411200	No, I didn't.
4411200	4413200	You really are trying to ruin me.
4413200	4414200	No, I wasn't.
4414200	4415200	You're just looking for things to talk about.
4415200	4416200	Oh, let's bring Demarj Brown up.
4416200	4417200	Yeah, bring up Demarj Brown.
4417200	4418200	Yay!
4418200	4419200	Hello.
4419200	4420200	Demarj.
4420200	4421200	Demarj kicked ass at the...
4421200	4422200	I'm sorry.
4422200	4423200	I'm sorry.
4423200	4424200	I'm sorry.
4424200	4425200	I'm sorry.
4425200	4426200	I'm sorry.
4426200	4427200	I'm sorry.
4427200	4428200	I'm sorry.
4428200	4429200	I'm sorry.
4429200	4430200	I'm sorry.
4430200	4431200	I'm sorry.
4431200	4432200	I'm sorry.
4432200	4433200	I'm sorry.
4433200	4434200	I'm sorry.
4434200	4435200	I'm sorry.
4435200	4436200	Icky+.
4436200	4437200	Yeah, Icky.
4437200	4438400	Icky kicked ass at the- the Channies last night.
4438400	4439200	Why thank you
4439200	4441740	What is that, the 12th annual channel 101 awards?
4441740	4442740	Is that the 12th annual?
4442740	4443740	Yeah.
4443740	4444760	I think it was 12, right?
4444760	4446240	Yeah, twelve years channel 101.
4446240	4447740	BY 2
4447740	4448740	hosted by Brady Novak
4448740	4449740	Brady was...
4449740	4450740	Insane
4450740	4451740	really fuckin' on
4451740	4452820	just running around like a mad man
4452820	4453820	that's not true
4453820	4454920	I've missed some channies before
4454920	4456480	I don't remember you missing a channie
4456480	4457960	I think I, there was a channie that had to miss
4457960	4461860	little
4461860	4462860	in time
4462860	4463860	I don't remember.
4463860	4464860	OK.
4464860	4465860	He was running and dancing
4465860	4466860	He was out of breath
4466860	4468360	and factored that into the comedy
4468360	4470500	Yeah, it was really funny
4470500	4472700	There's just pictures of actual dicks like photos
4472700	4474700	Weird
4474700	4475860	You don't respond to them
4475860	4477860	So I keep, I mean, like, you don't
4477860	4478860	You have to find the right one
4478860	4479860	I send you a picture of a dick
4479860	4480860	and you don't do anything
4480860	4482060	so I figure you didn't get it
4482060	4484540	So, like the guy in the writer's room
4484540	4486700	who keeps pitching the same joke
4486700	4491140	because no one's responding to it
4491140	4493580	I mean, I, look, maybe we could pick something
4493580	4494580	that we watched together
4494600	4495600	or something
4495600	4496600	because I don't watch TV anymore
4496600	4497600	now that I'm divorced
4497600	4498600	like there's no reason to watch things
4498600	4499600	and I just, I don't want to
4499600	4500600	I watch fucking crap movies
4500600	4503600	What's like hologram man and
4503600	4505600	What was the movie you played at your birthday?
4505600	4507600	Oh, Street Wars
4507600	4508600	Holy crap
4508600	4509600	That was a good night
4509600	4511600	That might have been the greatest thing I've ever seen
4511600	4512600	That didn't go to bed either
4512600	4513600	My birthday
4513600	4516600	Wasn't Street Wars the ultra-late airplane one?
4516600	4517600	Yeah
4517600	4518600	Oh man
4518600	4519600	That's a good movie
4519600	4520600	We gotta tell the people about
4520600	4522600	It's a bad gangster movie
4522600	4523600	OK, it's a movie from night
4523620	4524620	Check this out
4525620	4527620	Find Street Wars
4527620	4528620	It's so good
4528620	4530620	On VHS or DVD
4530620	4535620	But it's a movie from 1992
4535620	4536620	that saw like
4536620	4538620	Boys in the Hood and went
4538620	4540620	You know what this movie's missing?
4540620	4542620	Ultralight aircraft
4542620	4543620	Ultralight aircraft
4544620	4546620	I mean, it's not going anywhere
4546620	4547620	Yeah
4547620	4549620	They thought hip-hop was a fad
4549620	4550620	Right, right
4550620	4552620	Now they think ultralight aircraft is a fad
4552640	4554640	There's hip-hop in it too
4554640	4556640	Yeah, there's a lot of hip-hop in it
4556640	4560640	It's like a fully realized film with a soundtrack
4560640	4562640	There's a dance in it
4562640	4566640	Like there's a humpty hump like dance
4566640	4568640	It's all leading up to
4568640	4570640	Now we're gonna get into our ultralights
4570640	4573640	And we're gonna take back the streets
4573640	4575640	And they get into their ultralights
4575640	4577640	And they take back the streets
4577640	4578640	It delivers on the poster
4578640	4579640	It's great
4579640	4580640	Street Wars
4580640	4582640	I like movies like that where it's clearly like
4582640	4584640	The movie's made by a company
4584640	4586640	Like a karate studio
4586640	4588640	Or a dance studio
4588640	4590640	Miami Connection
4590640	4593640	Or an ultralight dealership
4593640	4595640	It's like we should make a movie
4595640	4596640	I think that's great
4596640	4597640	Somebody says
4597640	4599640	I'll give you the money
4599640	4602640	To make your movie about street life
4602640	4605640	If you show some of my product
4605640	4606640	In your film
4606640	4607640	Oh, that would be amazing
4607640	4609640	Yeah, I kept thinking of it
4609640	4611640	It was just like the same people
4611640	4612640	But that would be even funnier
4612640	4613640	That somebody was like
4613640	4615640	I'm a really passionate filmmaker
4615640	4618640	I'm like a pre-John Singleton
4618640	4619640	Or a contemporary
4619640	4621640	I don't know what year that movie was
4621640	4622640	But it's like
4622640	4624640	I'm gonna
4624640	4628640	I just wanna express my point of view
4628640	4630640	About what it is to grow up in the environment I grew up in
4630640	4632640	And then someone's like
4632640	4633640	Well, I'm not paying for it
4633640	4634640	I'm not paying for it
4634640	4635640	I'm not paying for it
4635640	4637640	I'll pay for it
4637640	4638640	I'll pay for it
4638640	4642640	My name's Bob Ultralight
4642640	4644640	From your local ultralight dealership
4644640	4646640	Did you have fun at my birthday party?
4646640	4648640	I had a blast
4648640	4649640	I'm so glad you were there
4649640	4651640	I caught up with my old friends
4651640	4652640	Thank you for coming to that
4652640	4653640	Thank you for coming to that
4653640	4657640	I invited Dan and Spencer
4657640	4658640	I caught up with old friends
4658640	4659640	I hadn't seen in a while
4659640	4660640	Yeah, me too
4660640	4663640	A lot of old friends I haven't seen in a while
4663640	4664640	A lot of good friends
4664640	4666640	A lot of new friends
4666640	4667640	It was cool
4668640	4669640	It was so cool
4669640	4670640	There's a point in the movie
4670640	4671640	The first time you see the ultralight
4671640	4672640	They're like
4672640	4673640	They're hanging out
4673640	4674640	I don't know where they are
4674640	4677640	And one of the main characters flies down in one
4677640	4678640	And there's a whole conversation
4678640	4679640	Where the guy's like
4679640	4680640	What is that?
4680640	4681640	And then he explains
4681640	4682640	He goes
4682640	4683640	You don't have a license to fly
4683640	4684640	And he goes
4684640	4685640	I don't need one
4685640	4686640	And then he goes to like a point by point explanation
4686640	4687640	Of the code that allows him
4687640	4688640	It's all right
4688640	4691640	The government doesn't yet recognize these as vehicles
4691640	4692640	So he can fly them
4692640	4694640	They're basically chairs with propellers
4694640	4695640	Yeah
4696640	4699640	I love that part of the enthusiasm for it
4699640	4701640	Is that it's totally fucking dangerous
4701640	4702640	Yeah, yeah
4702640	4704640	And at any moment we'll be banned or regulated
4704640	4705640	Yeah, yeah, yeah
4705640	4706640	But there's a loophole
4706640	4707640	Yeah
4708640	4709640	They shoot
4709640	4711640	The gangsters are on the ground
4711640	4713640	And they're not even like the right
4713640	4714640	They're like
4714640	4715640	They're wearing
4715640	4716640	They're all wearing
4716640	4717640	One shot
4717640	4718640	They're all wearing overalls
4718640	4720640	They're all wearing overalls in health
4720640	4721640	In bright colors in helmets
4721640	4722640	Yeah, yeah
4722640	4724640	And then the guys come flying in at night
4724640	4725640	Shooting at them
4725640	4726640	And then one of them turns around
4726640	4727640	And shoots back
4727640	4728640	And the guy goes
4728640	4729640	I'm hit
4729640	4730640	I'm going down
4730640	4731640	And then they yell out
4731640	4732640	You got T-Bone
4732640	4733640	You got T-Bone
4733640	4734640	I wouldn't have turned around
4734640	4735640	And talked to that ultra light
4735640	4736640	I would have bowled out
4736640	4740640	I cut like an hour out of that film too
4740640	4741640	Like I went through the whole film
4741640	4743640	And just went to the good stuff
4743640	4745640	Because when they get to the ultra lights
4745640	4746640	And you're like
4746640	4747640	All right
4747640	4748640	They got to the ultra light stuff
4748640	4749640	It's just like
4749640	4752640	Sit back for 45 minutes of
4752640	4754640	The same shot of the ultra light
4754640	4756640	Flying through a frame
4756640	4758640	And a guy on a sound stage
4758640	4759640	Going
4759640	4760640	It's just
4760640	4762640	It takes forever
4762640	4763640	Yeah
4763640	4764640	Yeah
4764640	4767640	The death to squib ratio
4767640	4768640	Is a little lower
4768640	4769640	Yeah, yeah
4769640	4771640	So it was like my 46th birthday
4771640	4772640	There's only
4772640	4773640	I only have one of those

4780640	4781640	For a long time
4782640	4783640	Not as old as
4783640	4784640	You know
4784640	4785640	Not the oldest friend I've had
4785640	4786640	But you know
4787640	4788640	But I'm glad you were there
4788640	4789640	It was good

4794640	4795640	Not tweeting
4795640	4796640	Happy birthday

4801640	4802640	Question mark
4807640	4809640	My dad hit me with a belt
4811640	4814640	Scud serial number is your birthday
4820640	4821640	Wait, Rob
4821640	4823640	So when you were coming up
4823640	4825640	When you were coming up with Scud
4825640	4826640	Were you like
4826640	4829640	You know what's a great number I should put on this?
4829640	4831640	Dan's birthday
4831640	4833640	And I know exactly what that is
4833640	4834640	No, no, no
4834640	4835640	I was
4835640	4836640	I remember it because I was
4836640	4839640	This is how old it was
4839640	4840640	It was like 1993
4840640	4844640	I was at Dave Riedel's like bedroom
4844640	4846640	And he had like what weasels
4846640	4848640	Remember his ferrets or whatever
4848640	4850640	That were like biting each other and fighting
4850640	4853640	And it smelled like weasel piss
4853640	4856640	And because I didn't know how to do
4856640	4858640	It was like one of those Macintoshes
4858640	4860640	Where the monitor and
4860640	4861640	Yeah
4861640	4863640	And he was designing
4863640	4865640	He was helping me design the attention sticker
4865640	4866640	On the back of Scud
4866640	4868640	And he was putting it in there
4868640	4869640	And you were there
4869640	4871640	You were like sitting on a couch or whatever
4871640	4872640	And I said, hey
4872640	4873640	We need a serial number
4873640	4875640	Hey, Dan, what's your birthday?
4875640	4877640	And then I put it in there
4877640	4878640	It's been that way
4878640	4879640	One, three, seven, three
4884640	4886640	That means it's coming up
4886640	4890640	I let you direct
4891640	4892640	Season six
4892640	4893640	Yep

4899640	4900640	I killed you

4903640	4905640	I killed Yahoo television
4905640	4906640	I killed it
4906640	4909640	They went, nah, we're not going to do any more of that
4909640	4911640	I gave you Sarah's show
4911640	4912640	I was like, you sure did
4912640	4913640	I
4913640	4914640	You sure did
4914640	4915640	This guy deserves this
4915640	4916640	I am
4916640	4917640	You did that a while ago
4917640	4918640	You did that
4918640	4920640	You did that a long time ago
4920640	4922640	You did that a long time ago
4922640	4923640	And that was that
4923640	4924640	I know there's something since then
4924640	4925640	Yeah
4926640	4928640	Those gourmet olives
4929640	4930640	No, you just forgot
4930640	4931640	It's fine
4931640	4932640	You forgot
4932640	4933640	You forgot about it
4933640	4934640	You forgot about me
4944640	4945640	How's it going?
4950640	4951640	I am sorry
4951640	4952640	You know what?
4952640	4955640	I acknowledge that I forgot your birthday
4955640	4958640	And I feel remorse about it
4958640	4959640	I do feel bad
4959640	4962640	And I'm going to remember your next birthday
4963640	4966640	Did you go through the three stages of apology
4966640	4970640	That our therapist has told us about?
4971640	4974640	That is the three stages of apology
4974640	4976640	Yeah, the three ingredients of a proper apology
4976640	4978640	Aaron didn't like that either
4978640	4980640	What are you counting off of the
4981640	4983640	No, because I've used that
4985640	4986640	But it's still
4986640	4987640	We go to the same therapist
4988640	4989640	Not on purpose
4990640	4991640	Not together either
4992640	4994640	Although we should probably
4994640	4996640	You've got her number from me
4996640	4998640	Yes, so on purpose
4998640	4999640	Yeah, on purpose
4999640	5001640	But I'm not doing it like
5001640	5003640	So what's he saying about me?
5003640	5005640	Nothing? Why is he not talking about me?
5007640	5010640	Motherfucker ain't talking about me at all
5010640	5014640	Every third person that comes down the stairs is someone we know
5015640	5018640	Our therapist is like some kind of like
5018640	5019640	John Lovett
5021640	5026640	Every crazy person in Los Feliz goes there
5026640	5028640	And I always go, you're crazy
5029640	5030640	And they go, you're crazy
5030640	5031640	You did that bit with me
5031640	5032640	I know
5032640	5033640	So you did that bit with everybody?
5038640	5039640	Unbelievable
5040640	5043640	Is this been a good show or
5043640	5044640	It's been a fantastic show
5044640	5045640	Yeah, it's been great
5047640	5049640	I don't really have a very objective
5050640	5051640	standpoint
5051640	5053640	It seems to me that it's been a nice
5053640	5055640	A nice ladder tube ride
5056640	5058640	With like a six pack of Mountain Dew
5058640	5059640	I'm telling you
5059640	5060640	I was so comfortable
5066640	5067640	I got nothing
5067640	5068640	I got nothing
5069640	5070640	Oh, ISIS
5070640	5071640	Two words to talk about, ISIS
5073640	5074640	What does ISIS stand for?
5077640	5078640	We look this up
5078640	5079640	What? Look this
5079640	5081640	Those are the easy words
5081640	5082640	Well, I don't know
5082640	5083640	What is it?
5084640	5085640	It's, yeah
5085640	5087640	RAC and Syria or RAC and LaFont, right?
5087640	5089640	Is that what the ISIL is?
5089640	5090640	Yeah, that's why
5090640	5091640	If you're an NPR you call it ISIL
5091640	5092640	Because it's like
5092640	5093640	Really more like going
5093640	5094640	You got RAGWA
5095640	5097640	Well, you're supposed to call it
5097640	5099640	Daesh because it pisses them off
5099640	5100640	Oh, really?
5100640	5101640	That's what they say
5101640	5102640	Yeah
5102640	5104640	They say they pledge to kill anyone
5104640	5105640	who calls them Daesh
5105640	5106640	Well, Jesus Christ
5108640	5110640	Well, that's what Voldemort said too
5110640	5111640	And look what happened there
5116640	5117640	Baltimore?
5117640	5118640	Baltimore?
5118640	5119640	Yeah
5119640	5120640	He never existed so
5120640	5122640	Wait, so that was his idea?
5122640	5123640	Don't ever say my name
5123640	5124640	He seems more vain than I
5124640	5125640	I don't know who came up with that
5125640	5126640	I think everybody else was like
5126640	5127640	Well, don't do that
5127640	5128640	I mean, like you're just asking for trouble
5128640	5129640	Yeah
5129640	5130640	There's gonna be some dickhead effect
5130640	5131640	It's the Streisand effect
5131640	5132640	Yeah
5132640	5133640	That's what Voldemort died of
5134640	5135640	Don't
5135640	5137640	Don't call me Streisand
5138640	5140640	Don't you dare call me Streisand
5141640	5142640	Don't Streis...
5142640	5143640	You call me Streisand
5143640	5144640	I'll put a hex on you
5145640	5147640	Don't call me Streisand
5147640	5149640	Don't you dare
5149640	5150640	If you call me
5150640	5152640	If you call me Streisand
5152640	5154640	I'm gonna come out
5154640	5156640	I'm gonna come down there
5157640	5158640	with my cane
5158640	5159640	And I'm gonna just
5159640	5160640	I'm gonna whack
5167640	5169640	Halfway through committing to that I gave up
5172640	5174640	It's not where you think it is
5178640	5180640	Well, the alarming thing is
5180640	5182640	This is when I keep running through in my head now
5182640	5185640	How actually effective
5185640	5187640	I don't even understand
5187640	5189640	As a 42-year-old
5189640	5191640	I grew up in a world where
5191640	5193640	the concept of terrorism was like
5193640	5195640	It was like these Fisher Price figures
5195640	5196640	and they got the outfits
5196640	5198640	and one of their defining features
5198640	5199640	is like
5199640	5200640	No graphic design
5200640	5201640	No
5201640	5203640	I mean, these guys are like
5203640	5205640	These are kids now
5205640	5207640	These are millennial terrorists
5207640	5209640	Their videos are
5209640	5211640	You know, very J.J. Abrams inspired
5212640	5214640	They like their little
5214640	5216640	time rampings
5216640	5218640	You know, they know their way around Final Cut
5218640	5220640	And it's weird
5220640	5222640	because it's like
5222640	5224640	for no other reason
5224640	5226640	than it just changes everything
5228640	5231640	And also, I think the other thing that makes them new
5231640	5233640	is that they
5233640	5236640	whereas I think when I was a kid
5236640	5238640	what we called a terrorist was somebody
5238640	5240640	that was kind of foolish enough to say
5240640	5242640	Well, I'm just going to
5242640	5244640	I'm going to create this
5244640	5245640	catastrophe
5245640	5247640	and it's going to punish
5247640	5249640	this country for doing this
5249640	5250640	and then they're going to think twice
5250640	5251640	before blah, blah, blah
5251640	5252640	and all that kind of thing
5252640	5253640	where it's just like
5253640	5254640	Well, this is just going to play out
5254640	5255640	in a pretty predictable way
5255640	5257640	No one's ever going to
5257640	5258640	blah, blah, blah
5258640	5259640	And that these
5259640	5261640	This is like their goal
5261640	5263640	as far as I understand it
5263640	5265640	Their long-term, larger goal
5265640	5267640	is simply to provoke
5267640	5270640	simply to actually polarize
5270640	5272640	And I hope that was a real sneeze
5272640	5273640	and not a good guy who's like
5273640	5274640	BULLSHIT
5278640	5279640	WOLF, WHAT'S YOUR
5281640	5284640	But their goal is simply to polarize, right?
5284640	5285640	This is not a conspiracy theory
5285640	5286640	This is like
5286640	5288640	I've heard this again and again
5288640	5290640	It's like what they want
5290640	5293640	and what they are so close to having
5293640	5295640	because it's like
5296640	5298640	So there are a couple of
5298640	5300640	blown up things away from this goal
5300640	5301640	From polarizing
5301640	5305640	Is for rational people
5305640	5309640	Not just like paranoid, jingoist, nutbars
5309640	5311640	Like rational people
5311640	5314640	to start getting so freaked out
5314640	5316640	and scared that we just start to
5316640	5319640	just figure the solution must be
5319640	5321640	more irrational than rational
5321640	5323640	Because right now we still have this like
5324640	5326640	This hold on this idea that
5326640	5328640	as complicated as things are getting
5328640	5331640	Like we have to make sure
5331640	5333640	we compartmentalize in our heads
5333640	5336640	This is a war between people that want to fight
5336640	5338640	and people that don't want to fight
5338640	5340640	This is not a war between
5340640	5342640	people that want to fight
5342640	5344640	that have one flag
5344640	5345640	This is like
5345640	5346640	The people that love fighting
5346640	5348640	are trying to fucking cajole us
5348640	5350640	into a crazy fucking
5350640	5352640	weird form of World War III
5352640	5355640	where it's just like
5355640	5357640	where we just start doing crazy shit
5357640	5358640	which we've done in the past
5358640	5359640	which is like
5359640	5360640	Alright, let's start rounding people up
5360640	5362640	and it's already been being proposed
5362640	5364640	by our fringe elements
5364640	5365640	Let's start tracking things
5365640	5367640	Let's start keeping lists
5367640	5368640	Let's put you in a
5368640	5369640	I'm sure you're great
5369640	5370640	If you're not guilty
5370640	5371640	you have nothing to worry about
5371640	5373640	but why don't you stay in this chain link
5373640	5374640	pen for a second
5374640	5375640	It's just about freedom
5375640	5376640	And
5378640	5380640	And that those people
5380640	5381640	are not gonna fucking
5381640	5382640	go in there and go
5382640	5383640	You know what?
5383640	5384640	America's fantastic
5384640	5386640	And so is the entire western world
5386640	5387640	And you know what sucks?
5387640	5389640	My religion is why I'm locked up in this cage
5389640	5392640	That this cycle will create
5392640	5394640	a shit-or-get-off-the-pot
5394640	5397640	showdown between people who
5397640	5399640	of the Islamic faith
5399640	5401640	radical or not
5401640	5403640	and people from Western society
5403640	5405640	Westernized society
5407640	5409640	Crazy or not
5409640	5411640	That even the moderate people
5411640	5413640	will all just be sucked into this
5413640	5414640	horrible fucking nightmare
5414640	5416640	And that shit will hit the fan
5416640	5417640	and spray all over all of us
5417640	5419640	and we'll have shit all over us
5419640	5420640	That's their goal
5420640	5422640	That's shit on us
5422640	5425640	That they're not dumb enough anymore
5425640	5426640	to be like
5426640	5428640	Oh, I'm gonna
5428640	5431640	We're gonna beat this country
5431640	5432640	They're just like
5432640	5433640	No, the fucking list is
5433640	5435640	Like what Charles Manson thought
5435640	5436640	he was trying to do
5436640	5438640	by spray painting the n-word
5438640	5440640	on the wall where he killed people
5440640	5443640	His idea was this long-term
5443640	5445640	destabilization thing
5445640	5447640	Doesn't it feel like they're getting
5447640	5450640	really close to that goal?
5450640	5451640	I don't know how we're gonna get
5451640	5452640	further away from that goal
5452640	5453640	I don't know how we're gonna
5453640	5456640	get less scared if
5456640	5459640	I don't know how to relax more
5459640	5461640	I only know how to get increasingly
5461640	5463640	more uptight and frightened
5463640	5465640	and more willing to
5465640	5467640	I feel like any one of those groups
5467640	5470640	is at that point right now
5470640	5472640	Because if you want to do that
5472640	5474640	then you simply have to do that
5474640	5477640	If somebody wanted to scare the shit out of people
5477640	5479640	and that was their sole goal
5479640	5484640	they could, for lack of a better idea
5484640	5486640	just load up a device or whatever
5486640	5487640	go off to the highway somewhere
5487640	5489640	pull off the road and set that off
5489640	5490640	That without any explanation
5490640	5491640	or any rational connection to it
5491640	5492640	and no claim to it
5492640	5493640	would be the thing that would be
5493640	5494640	the most terrifying to people
5495640	5498640	But I think that these issues
5498640	5500640	are multi-phasic
5500640	5502640	there are so many different things that are at play
5502640	5504640	and specifically in this case
5504640	5506640	because fundamentalism is at the center of it
5506640	5509640	there is a core center
5509640	5514640	and there is a core center schedule
5514640	5516640	for what's going on
5516640	5518640	but outside of that
5518640	5521640	where it reaches out from that core center
5521640	5523640	there are just a lot of different sets of goals
5523640	5528640	and they're individual in their own sort of way
5528640	5531640	they're going to play out on what those individual goals are
5531640	5533640	so certain things are happening
5533640	5536640	but they're happening in their own sort of arena
5536640	5539640	and also we see on our end of it
5539640	5541640	the packaged news version of it
5541640	5543640	even now when news is 24 hours a day
5543640	5545640	and it's all over the place
5545640	5547640	you're being told you're getting breaking news
5547640	5549640	but again it depends on what you're reading
5549640	5550640	and where you are
5550640	5551640	and what the moment is
5551640	5552640	and what the source is
5552640	5554640	how filtered or unfiltered or how breaking it is
5554640	5556640	but it's all packaged
5556640	5559640	so what you're not getting is
5559640	5560640	and this is probably a good thing
5560640	5562640	you're not getting a clear sense of what
5562640	5566640	for example the extent of our interdiction is on this
5566640	5568640	one of the reasons it's just not running buck wild
5568640	5570640	and going crazy is because
5570640	5573640	the opposing force, unified sort of interdiction on it
5573640	5576640	is strong, it's powerful
5576640	5579640	Intel and these forces that are sitting there
5579640	5582640	grabbing information, closing down things
5582640	5584640	letting you know when they stop somebody
5584640	5586640	letting you know sometimes not letting you know when they have
5586640	5589640	because it's better for the longer goal
5589640	5596640	all that stuff is happening outside of your sight
5596640	5598640	unless they want you to see it
5598640	5601640	so what we're seeing
5601640	5603640	we are by virtue of being audience to this
5603640	5606640	trying to attach a plot to it
5606640	5609640	trying to foresee an endgame to it
5609640	5613640	trying to attach all these sort of narratives to it
5613640	5617640	but really what it is is just this pulse like movement of
5617640	5619640	let's probe in this case
5619640	5622640	there's a hole, let's go get that
5622640	5624640	there's a hole that hasn't been exploited
5624640	5627640	let's just wait, let's just wait, now let's do it
5627640	5629640	but all these things are coming out all at the same time
5629640	5633640	so I think that on the one hand we are audience to this
5633640	5635640	and what we're reacting to
5635640	5639640	the temperature of the water that we are feeling right now
5639640	5643640	is real but it's reactive to what we're being allowed to see
5643640	5645640	what we're being allowed to read
5645640	5647640	but what's really going on is much more detailed
5647640	5649640	much more specific
5649640	5652640	and it's happening in pulses, it's a very pointillistic thing
5652640	5654640	and in each one of those cases
5654640	5656640	there's a whole inventory of stuff that's happening
5656640	5658640	outward incursions that are coming forward
5658640	5661640	whether they're quiet incursions or more aggressive incursions
5661640	5666640	and then also the reportage and interdiction that's going on around
5666640	5668640	how much people actually know
5668640	5670640	unless you're in intelligence
5670640	5674640	it's really, really, really, really, really unclear
5674640	5677640	and so this is why it is really important for people
5677640	5679640	to see as much as they can
5679640	5682640	read as much as they can and use these sort of
5682640	5685640	general principles of critical thinking so you know what your sources are
5685640	5687640	what their biases may be
5687640	5690640	and getting multi-source information about one incident or one thing
5690640	5693640	allows you to determine for yourself what you think the narrative is
5693640	5695640	because for each person out there there's a separate narrative
5695640	5697640	of what is actually going on
5697640	5699640	I don't think that the sole goal is
5699640	5704640	to scatter publics
5704640	5708640	any sort of unified public certainty or confidence that we have
5708640	5710640	I don't think there's at least with the core you talked about
5710640	5713640	you don't think at least when they have their meetings that they go like
5713640	5715640	no, big, big, big picture
5715640	5717640	no, no, I do think that's part of it
5717640	5718640	but I think that there are other
5718640	5721640	within that I think there are other more specifically defined
5721640	5725640	defined measures and goals and there are things that are targeted specifically
5725640	5728640	I mean, it's great, I mean, yeah, certainly
5728640	5731640	I mean, listen, Frasier, all I want to know is
5731640	5733640	where the bad guys are
5733640	5734640	BANG! BANG! BANG!
5734640	5736640	No, no, I
5736640	5739640	that advice from what I called of it is like
5739640	5743640	yeah, be smart and understand that even the internet is mostly garbage
5743640	5746640	and that everything is a narrative and everything is being assembled
5746640	5748640	and pre-processed and that
5748640	5751640	and that I think maybe not to put words in your mouth but like
5751640	5754640	maybe I just did a little diatribe about how
5754640	5757640	the bad guys want everybody to hate each other
5757640	5760640	and like maybe adding to that also
5760640	5764640	we're getting our news from good guys that don't necessarily
5764640	5768640	lose money from us hating each other
5768640	5771640	so it compounds that
5772640	5776640	this country needs nothing more right now than a nice solid
5776640	5779640	clean enemy with a logo
5779640	5782640	and you know, they're stepping up and we're going like
5782640	5785640	I'll take the number five with cheese
5785640	5787640	you look at like a good example is like
5787640	5790640	I can't think of the guy saying but the former KGB agent who
5790640	5793640	was radiated
5793640	5795640	are first
5795640	5797640	radiated
5798640	5801640	that means he hasn't been listening for 20 minutes
5801640	5802640	that's what he does
5802640	5804640	he picks one word
5804640	5805640	he puts his glasses down
5805640	5807640	I was looking at the text
5807640	5809640	that you've been sending me over the last
5809640	5810640	oh, come on
5810640	5812640	alright, alright
5812640	5814640	hey, you home?
5814640	5815640	yeah, give me a bit
5815640	5818640	got to tend to some cat
5818640	5819640	shropping over
5819640	5820640	no, wait bro
5820640	5822640	come at 6.30 bro
5822640	5824640	you fucking idiot
5828640	5832640	I wasn't even clear who was saying what
5832640	5835640	you were calling me a fucking idiot
5835640	5838640	you were coming over a half hour early
5838640	5840640	you didn't specify
5840640	5843640	no, you were saying shropping over
5858640	5863640	there's a geopolitical tinder box underneath us right now
5863640	5864640	I'm sorry, I'm sorry
5864640	5865640	it's a powder keg
5865640	5867640	you guys could be talking about the Packers
5867640	5869640	I could, I'm so
5869640	5872640	I'm so, I don't know, my brain, you know
5872640	5874640	it can only hold, it's got three cartoons
5874640	5875640	I know, I know
5875640	5877640	and a David Carradine movie
5877640	5880640	look, I'm definitely, I'm definitely the gargamel
5880640	5882640	in this situation, I can't
5882640	5884640	but I only have
5884640	5887640	my bucket is only so big
5890640	5891640	Spencer disappeared
5891640	5893640	he just like evaporated
5893640	5895640	he like went away, he's gone
5895640	5897640	you're not making fun of him
5897640	5899640	he gets a bye, I don't get a bye
5899640	5902640	I'm a fucking idiot because I came over a half hour early
5904640	5907640	September 21st
5907640	5913640	I mean the truth, I remember that day
5913640	5918640	I had just gotten home and I was about to masturbate
5918640	5921640	dude, we have an agreement
5921640	5922640	I wait outside
5922640	5924640	and I'm like shropping over
5924640	5926640	that doesn't mean you have to come downstairs
5926640	5928640	I get it
5928640	5930640	how many times, I get it, dude
5930640	5933640	I can't come that way
5934640	5937640	sorry, I'm, no I got it buddy
5937640	5939640	I'm just down here to take your time
5939640	5942640	I'll go to the grocery store
5943640	5945640	what a good friend, so understanding
5945640	5947640	ohhhh
5948640	5952640	when we lived together on Norton it was like that
5952640	5955640	I was younger, nothing could stop this
5955640	5957640	now it's like fucking
5957640	5960640	you know, Fox News can put me out for a week
5960640	5962640	right, that's true
5962640	5965640	so, ISIS is pronounced how?
5967640	5968640	Daesh
5968640	5969640	Daesh
5969640	5972640	but if you say it, candy man comes and kills you
5972640	5974640	alright, ok, ok
5974640	5976640	I don't know, but we're not supposed to be scared, right?
5976640	5978640	ok, we're not scared, everybody go shopping
5980640	5982640	that's how you beat him, go shopping
5982640	5984640	love your way of life
5984640	5985640	that's what they hate
5985640	5986640	I'm doing ok
5986640	5987640	your way of life
5987640	5988640	yeah, I'm doing alright
5988640	5990640	I'm happy, I'm, I'm, I'm doing
5990640	5992640	these are my salad days, man
5992640	5995640	alright, let me get Steve Levy out here
5995640	5997640	just to check in with him
5997640	5998640	I know the people
6005640	6009640	I'm not going to rap tonight, I don't need you
6009640	6010640	thank god
6010640	6014640	but I'm just curious, have you listened to the Public Enemy song
6014640	6016640	where we talked about
6016640	6017640	no
6017640	6019640	what?
6019640	6021640	back up, I don't know what you're talking about
6021640	6023640	what's the, what's the big Public Enemy song
6023640	6025640	the number one, I'm not going to look at the march when I ask
6025640	6027640	I'm looking over the space
6027640	6029640	because we're all beams of light
6029640	6032640	public enemy had the big number one
6032640	6034640	that was, they're, they're fucking like
6034640	6036640	fear of a black planet
6036640	6037640	well that was the album, right?
6037640	6038640	that was the album
6038640	6039640	what was the song?
6039640	6040640	I didn't say it wasn't
6040640	6043640	how low can you go to throw whatever other knows
6043640	6044640	bring the noise
6044640	6045640	bring the noise, right
6045640	6046640	that's anthrax
6046640	6047640	so listen to bring the noise
6047640	6049640	but not the anthrax version
6049640	6051640	oh okay, yeah, I won't
6051640	6052640	no, I won't listen to that
6052640	6054640	I'm talking to Steve Levy
6054640	6056640	you were looking at me, man
6056640	6058640	I'm not going to listen to it
6058640	6059640	I won't listen to that ever
6059640	6061640	no, not that anthrax shit
6061640	6062640	I don't understand
6062640	6064640	no, I like the anthrax version too
6064640	6066640	I won't listen to it
6066640	6069640	I don't understand, I don't like it
6069640	6071640	keep scratching your pants
6071640	6076640	come on, get your chin off your chest
6076640	6078640	let's look at these other people
6078640	6080640	come on, look at who you're talking to
6080640	6082640	for once, there you go
6082640	6083640	now, alright
6083640	6085640	you ask your therapist and she'll tell you
6085640	6087640	I'm capable of dissolving relationships
6087640	6089640	that are supposed to be forever
6089640	6090640	I don't
6093640	6096640	I don't know any fucking bounds
6096640	6098640	alright
6099640	6101640	believe me, I'll go to the bathroom
6101640	6103640	after using me
6103640	6105640	and then I'll be in there for a long time
6105640	6108640	and you'll come in and there'll be a curtain blown in the wind
6108640	6111640	and then you'll see a black and white photo of me
6111640	6114640	in Alaska, ice fishing
6115640	6116640	and I'll be like
6116640	6118640	and it'll be from 1911
6120640	6123640	that's how far away from you I'll get
6123640	6127640	I'll become a weird, like a psychological thriller
6128640	6130640	with a question mark for an ending
6130640	6131640	you won't even know
6131640	6133640	you'll have to write a paper about it
6133640	6135640	just to see me again
6135640	6137640	I don't think I'll do that
6137640	6139640	I'll skip the paper
6140640	6143640	do people read newspapers anymore? I mean, come on
6145640	6148640	this is me, what's happening?
6148640	6151640	oh, oh, there's another one
6151640	6153640	the weather
6153640	6155640	who does that?
6155640	6156640	come on
6157640	6159640	shots fired
6162640	6164640	oh, I gotta get to the classifieds
6165640	6167640	I mean, seriously, nobody does that anymore
6167640	6169640	ah, kill more trees, anyway
6169640	6171640	take no prisoners
6171640	6172640	yeah
6172640	6175640	it's all newsprint
6175640	6177640	ink on your fingers
6177640	6179640	under your fingernails
6179640	6181640	oh, by the way, journalism industry
6181640	6183640	if you're listening to me, I pray you are
6183640	6185640	I've been hearing
6185640	6188640	you're wondering, how are you going to save journalism?
6188640	6190640	just make a seal, make a thing
6190640	6193640	get together with the last of the journalists that still exist
6193640	6195640	have a meeting
6195640	6197640	it doesn't have to be a government thing
6197640	6200640	make it a private consortium of respected journalists
6203640	6208640	an impartial consortium of journalists experts
6208640	6211640	and create a thing that you put on a website
6211640	6214640	if your website purports to be taken seriously
6214640	6217640	as a source of actual news
6217640	6220640	just put a little logo in the corner
6220640	6222640	that's very, very distinctive
6222640	6224640	oh, how do you enforce that?
6224640	6226640	it'll be better than nothing
6226640	6229640	it'll be a barrier between fecal matter and drinking water
6229640	6231640	on the internet
6231640	6234640	yeah, so stop
6234640	6237640	the fucking senators talking about videos that don't exist
6237640	6239640	of babies looking at the camera and going
6239640	6241640	help me before they get aborted
6241640	6245640	because they read about it on fucking
6245640	6248640	shark mike
6248640	6251640	shark mike's world
6251640	6253640	dot blog org
6253640	6255640	and he's doing a bit
6255640	6257640	that no one knew about
6257640	6260640	anyways, put a little seal
6260640	6263640	yeah, purported
6263640	6265640	this dude said interdiction
6265640	6267640	I don't even know what the fuck
6268640	6270640	no, I'm agreeing with you
6270640	6271640	I'm gonna ask later
6271640	6276640	I was too stupid to be proud of myself for wanting to know
6276640	6280640	I'm so stupid, I'm too stupid to ask what does that mean
6280640	6284640	I don't, I just listen
6284640	6287640	contextually I got over time it meant like intervention
6287640	6293640	or circumscriptions, circumventing
6293640	6297640	look, all I wanna know is where they are
6297640	6299640	can I just say, I should say this
6299640	6301640	this is outside of all that stuff
6301640	6303640	alright, here we go
6303640	6305640	it was the 12th annual awards
6305640	6307640	Dan didn't go
6307640	6310640	well, yeah, but there were a lot of people there
6310640	6311640	yeah, except Dan
6311640	6313640	and a new group
6313640	6315640	it's okay, it's okay, I'm just going down the facts
6315640	6317640	here we go, okay, here we go, okay, okay
6317640	6318640	Dan wasn't there
6318640	6319640	we had an important meeting
6319640	6321640	he had an important meeting, more important than channel 101
6321640	6323640	yeah, okay, here we go, let's go
6323640	6325640	could have been very lucrative
6325640	6328640	he's gonna make a lot of money
6328640	6332640	no, my studio, I keep selling shows of money
6332640	6336640	channel 101 doesn't make you any money, so you didn't go
6336640	6338640	alright, here we go, what happened?
6338640	6341640	it's okay
6341640	6344640	all of this contributes to the great thing that happened last night
6344640	6346640	it happens once a year, at the end of the year
6346640	6350640	where, I guess it just sort of acknowledges the fact that this thing is there
6350640	6352640	but there were so many people there
6352640	6354640	who were friends of mine
6354640	6356640	from the time I got to LA
6356640	6358640	up until now, who are still my friends
6358640	6360640	which is insane, it almost doesn't happen in the city
6360640	6362640	and people who
6362640	6365640	you know, we used to just sit around and eat Oreos and watch TV
6365640	6369640	and now we actually do things in the fields that we came out here to pursue
6369640	6371640	there were new people there
6371640	6374640	coming just to see, there were people working as interns
6374640	6376640	who had just heard about it
6376640	6378640	and thought that this was a chance to get close to it
6378640	6381640	and actually physically do something and be around it
6381640	6383640	and it's a great thing, I think a lot
6383640	6385640	most of the really good stuff that I've done
6385640	6387640	since I've been in the city
6387640	6393640	is connected to that place, figurative or otherwise
6393640	6395640	and the friends that I've made through it
6395640	6398640	and so it's just a nice scene to be sitting in the back of that row
6398640	6401640	and watching, you know, I mean I don't know whether I'll do much
6401640	6403640	or anything with it this year
6403640	6405640	but I'll do some things
6406640	6408640	but I will always have those friends
6408640	6411640	those friends are always around and will always hang out and do great stuff
6411640	6413640	and it was just watching people
6413640	6415640	it was run by a whole new group of people
6415640	6417640	it was really beautiful Dan
6417640	6418640	struggling
6418640	6419640	should have been there, it was great
6419640	6420640	struggling to hold that thing together
6420640	6422640	because they made the mistakes at each new group that comes in
6422640	6425640	and then the next year they got a better handle on it and another handle on it
6425640	6427640	it's just great to watch it, I think it's fantastic
6427640	6430640	and I think you guys in that speech
6430640	6432640	you should have heard that Dan
6433640	6434640	and that's it
6434640	6437640	I mean, I know I'm walking into this trap
6437640	6440640	but I pay for it
6440640	6442640	Hey, you pay for it?
6442640	6444640	I mean, what is it?
6444640	6445640	No, I pay for it too
6445640	6446640	I missed one Chinese
6446640	6447640	I paid for it too
6447640	6450640	and one year of Channel 101 screenings
6450640	6453640	I for one too, I was saying thank you Dan
6453640	6455640	and thank you Rob
6455640	6456640	and you're welcome
6456640	6458640	I haven't got a Channel 101 in a year either
6458640	6460640	so it's big of a dick
6460640	6462640	so then you go to the Chinese because...
6462640	6463640	yeah, out of guilt
6463640	6465640	and I got so fucking stoned
6465640	6468640	that I might as well have not been there
6470640	6473640	I was like cackling throughout the entire thing
6473640	6475640	people were just like
6475640	6477640	okay, we'll just put this here
6477640	6478640	and then I'm like
6482640	6484640	alright, we're just gonna put this here
6484640	6487640	sorry, man, we're having a stutter in the
6488640	6490640	that was a mess
6490640	6491640	that was a mess
6491640	6493640	glad you didn't see me
6493640	6495640	I'm glad you weren't there, Dan, to see me
6495640	6497640	so glad you weren't there
6497640	6501640	I'm trying to keep a studio afloat
6501640	6503640	as it expands
6503640	6506640	more Channel 101 people get to have jobs
6506640	6508640	as actual writers and directors and things
6508640	6510640	this thing has drawers
6510640	6512640	I've never noticed this
6512640	6514640	there's actual stuff in it
6514640	6517640	have you found Jeff Davis' secret diary?
6517640	6519640	I found a piece of paper with something on it
6519640	6520640	day one
6520640	6522640	I think I'm gonna tell the cake story
6523640	6525640	can't remember exactly what happened
6525640	6527640	but I know the chef thanked me for eating it
6533640	6534640	day two
6534640	6535640	there's a list
6535640	6537640	just shared the 9-11 dream

6734640	6736640	I was on Ecstasy when I saw that show

6738640	6740640	the witches thing, they were flying around

6742640	6743640	well they defied gravity
6743640	6744640	you made a reference to it
6744640	6746640	I've heard some of that song

6747640	6749640	and it turns it right out in an ear
6749640	6750640	it never needed to be turned on
6750640	6751640	right
6751640	6752640	because that show is
6752640	6754640	already about flying monkeys

6970640	6971640	when you see the ring
6971640	6972640	get a little smaller
6972640	6973640	I like stuff like that
6973640	6974640	I like when they explain it
6974640	6976640	when he threw it in the volcano
6976640	6978640	when he threw it in the volcano man
6978640	6979640	hey Dan remember that

6981640	6983640	he throws it in the volcano
6983640	6984640	and then they come back
6984640	6986640	to the other the other hobbits
6986640	6987640	that are like infighting
6987640	6988640	and they're in slow motion
6988640	6989640	and they're crying
6989640	6990640	and they're going
6990640	6992640	Frodo
6992640	6993640	Frodo
6993640	6995640	because the mountain exploded
6995640	6997640	they're crying like
6997640	6999640	you watched 90 hours of that saga
6999640	7001640	and really all it came down to is
7001640	7002640	could someone have just
7002640	7004640	gone and talked to these green ghosts
7004640	7005640	a lot earlier
7005640	7006640	because they turned out
7006640	7008640	to be the nuclear option
7008640	7009640	they're just like
7009640	7010640	the green ghost
7010640	7012640	that trilogy should be called
7012640	7014640	a journey to convince the green ghosts
7014640	7015640	to help you
7015640	7017640	because once you do
7017640	7018640	you're done
7018640	7019640	they were like
7019640	7020640	brrrr
7020640	7021640	like just going through
7021640	7022640	they would just
7022640	7024640	show the elephant monsters
7024640	7025640	they were like
7025640	7026640	ahhh green ghosts
7026640	7027640	everyone was like
7027640	7029640	green ghosts can't be stopped
7029640	7030640	remember the second one
7030640	7031640	where the bee story

7032640	7033640	and the tree man
7033640	7034640	walking
7034640	7035640	into the movie
7035640	7036640	yeah and the bit
7036640	7038640	was how boring he was
7038640	7039640	but he's like

7045640	7047640	talking
7047640	7050640	cause trees are slow

7362640	7364640	adorable attempt at detective work
7364640	7366640	the team decided to head to a
7366640	7368640	nano opium den after indulging
7368640	7370640	in a little cyberware hate speech
7370640	7372640	dr. friend managed to find his old
7372640	7374640	Shleemo David McChinaman
7374640	7376640	they pulled up to a few
7376640	7378640	cyber beanbags to engage in some
7378640	7380640	light conversation and non-consensual
7380640	7382640	brain scanning but McChinaman
7382640	7384640	didn't have the information they sought
7384640	7386640	in the end he wasn't completely
7386640	7388640	useless he was able to shed some
7388640	7390640	light on the sinister meat market
7390640	7392640	which lures people with the promise
7392640	7394640	of companionship and cyber
7394640	7396640	burgers only to snatch them away
7396640	7398640	in a white van to sell their
7398640	7400640	dismembered corpses for meat
7400640	7402640	the shadow runners quickly hatched
7402640	7404640	a plan to fight honey pot

7734640	7736640	testing lots of corporations do
7736640	7738640	that shit you know but these are the ones that

7750640	7752640	on them well okay then there you go that's what I'm
7752640	7754640	looking for
7754640	7756640	well those happen all over the place you know
7756640	7758640	we got cyberware there's all sorts of
7758640	7760640	brain things there's magic there's all
7760640	7762640	sorts of things that need human test
7762640	7764640	subjects you know it's pretty
7764640	7766640	common around here
7766640	7768640	specifically uh uh these
7768640	7770640	sort of mutated people the ghoulish people
7770640	7772640	do you understand
7772640	7774640	I don't know anyone who's been looking from
7774640	7776640	ghouls that's some fucked up shit man
7776640	7778640	do you know what
7778640	7780640	the place would be where they would
7780640	7782640	be drawn or where they would be taken from
7782640	7784640	taken to from there uh if you're talking about
7784640	7786640	ghouls I mean there's those clinics
7786640	7788640	right they've been popping up popping down
7788640	7790640	popping left and popping right
7790640	7792640	the last one I heard of is called
7792640	7794640	press f5 to refresh
7794640	7796640	it's a ghoul treatment
7796640	7798640	it's a ghoul treatment center
7798640	7800640	don't reward that don't reward that
7802640	7804640	it takes a technological approach
7804640	7806640	to healing the ghoulish
7806640	7808640	the ghoulish nature of its patience
7812640	7814640	that sounds good
7817640	7819640	ask them about the white vans
7819640	7821640	you're saying like well I'm not listening
7821640	7823640	okay yeah
7823640	7824640	uh
7824640	7826640	are there
7826640	7828640	white vans associated with this
7828640	7830640	I don't know about no white vans but
7830640	7832640	if you're looking for ghouls that's where
7832640	7834640	the ghouls show up that's where I'd steal
7834640	7836640	some flesh from so uh
7836640	7838640	could you uh get me the information and
7838640	7840640	location and oh yeah I'll email

7848640	7850640	to you now
7850640	7852640	received alright
7852640	7854640	gentlemen I have a
7854640	7856640	great idea we could dress up
7856640	7858640	as ghouls and
7858640	7860640	infiltrate this place
7860640	7862640	I have a makeup kit
7864640	7866640	I'll start
7868640	7870640	it's actually
7870640	7872640	not a bad idea
7873640	7875640	we should call an uber
7875640	7877640	well I think I'm assuming
7877640	7879640	if we're going to do a good job of this
7879640	7881640	this is not going to be farcical
7881640	7883640	it probably takes longer than an uber
7883640	7885640	hi boys
7885640	7887640	it's me
7887640	7889640	I'm a ghoul
7893640	7895640	and if y'all want to be
7895640	7897640	dressed up like me
7902640	7904640	what
7904640	7906640	what strange
7908640	7910640	cultural environment
7910640	7912640	resulted in you thinking that
7912640	7914640	ghouls are southern bells
7916640	7918640	sure like to eat some brains
7918640	7920640	right about now
7922640	7924640	no it's just me
7924640	7926640	gentlemen oh
7926640	7928640	I do think that's a good idea I don't
7928640	7930640	I don't think we should do the fans or the
7930640	7932640	the ball gowns but I
7932640	7934640	but I do think the idea of looking ghoulish
7934640	7936640	alright well here's my
