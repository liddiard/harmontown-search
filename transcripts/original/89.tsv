0	23000	["We Got Your Own Biz!" plays in the background.]
23000	26000	She comes in San Francisco, California!
26000	29000	Don't you worry, cuz we got your own biz!
29000	31000	We call it a day, get to the beat!
31000	35000	This is my question to ask, and Hermann Towne is now in session.
36000	39000	Would you please welcome on the stage the mayor of Hermann Towne,
39000	41000	Bland Hermann!
53000	55000	Thank you!
57000	60000	What a delightful bunch you are, thank you.
60000	64000	I'm very flattered by your attendance numbers, very flattered by your enthusiasm.
64000	68000	Let's see what we can do to just punish it, right?
68000	72000	Certainly, I don't have an act, but you guys are fans of the podcast, so you know that.
72000	77000	So, if we do nothing but get drunk and ramble for two hours,
77000	81000	that's a little slice of Los Angeles for our friends in San Francisco.
81000	84000	So, you guys are obviously, there's a lot of people from San Francisco here,
84000	89000	but there's always a tremendous amount of you that are from the Outlands,
89000	92000	who have pilgrimage here to see all kinds of stuff.
92000	96000	How many people in the latter group? How many non-San Franciscites?
99000	103000	Just curious about that. It feels like roughly 40%?
103000	105000	Yeah, or more 50, I don't know.
105000	109000	I think this is our third time doing a San Francisco Sketchfest.
109000	113000	But our first time here in this room, it seems like a lovely room.
114000	119000	I don't know. It's a little intimidating. It feels kind of like a cattle auction.
119000	122000	See, I'm not that intimidated because the only times I've ever been here...
122000	123000	I'll fuck off Jeff.
123000	127000	No, no. I'm telling you why, because I've only ever been out in the audience
127000	130000	watching the highest Doug Benson you've ever seen in your life.
130000	134000	And he's hilarious, but the stakes are low because he's so mellow.
134000	138000	You can just kind of be delightful out here.
138000	141000	No, no, I'm not going to ruin it by second guess again.
141000	145000	It's interesting, the dynamic that shifts between different rooms.
145000	148000	We sit in the back of a comic book store in Los Angeles,
148000	152000	and it's different acoustics and different things.
152000	156000	Doug Benson, as high as he is, always has an act to fall back on
156000	158000	or a joint in his pocket or something.
158000	162000	All I've got is my ever note pad.
162000	168000	I wanted to make an announcement that I've been having a very successful experiment
168000	171000	since I stepped foot into San Francisco.
171000	174000	It's a two-fold thing, and I don't know how to describe it.
174000	176000	It seems kind of contradictory.
176000	181000	One thing is called owning it. I'm owning it.
181000	182000	What?
182000	184000	It. I'm owning it.
184000	186000	Like I'm owning everything.
186000	191000	I'm not apologizing for anything anymore.
191000	194000	For instance, the fact that I'm fat. I'm owning it.
194000	198000	I can't tell I'm fat because I'm owning it.
198000	201000	It seems like I'm supposed to be fat.
201000	204000	Santa Claus owns it.
204000	207000	Santa Claus is technically fat, but no one ever...
207000	213000	That one guy, that one dick describes him as fat in his first poem about Santa Claus.
213000	217000	From then on, we're just like, he's awesome. He owns it.
217000	221000	Your sweater has a suspicion about it.
221000	226000	It's got some secrets.
226000	230000	I chose a color that absorbs light rather than reflects it,
230000	237000	hoping that somehow the enterprise of your eyeballs would slingshot around the sun of my stomach
237000	240000	and go back in time to when I was 25.
240000	245000	Didn't you make a decision to go on a diet since you got engaged
245000	248000	that you would become slim and lithe and sexy for your wedding?
248000	252000	Well, you have to back into a number.
252000	258000	I'm going to be thin by my wedding, so you just keep pushing the date.
258000	262000	Then every day becomes...
262000	266000	I had two quarter pounders yesterday that I didn't tell Erin about.
266000	269000	It's fucked up. It's fucked up.
269000	272000	She doesn't know. I haven't talked to her about it.
272000	274000	How many did you have that you did tell her about?
274000	278000	I've had like 90 that I told her about and 160 that I haven't.
278000	282000	I've discussed this before. Erin and I, my betrothed Erin McGathey.
282000	287000	It's a dream relationship.
287000	291000	The interests that we share are going to kill us.
291000	294000	The interests that we share are...
294000	298000	We are passionate about our pursuit of a sedentary lifestyle.
298000	301000	We just think that people should be sedentary.
301000	304000	We love it. We love watching movies that we don't even enjoy.
304000	307000	I got one of those special pillows.
307000	310000	That's the first thing I did when I started...
310000	312000	When Erin moved in, I got one of those...
312000	315000	They call them boyfriend pillows.
315000	317000	That's the technical name for them.
317000	320000	They're those pillows that are shaped like a little easy chair.
320000	322000	Do you know what I mean?
322000	325000	I don't know what I'm expecting. You're all going to nod.
325000	328000	Two hundred people are going to nod their head.
328000	330000	These are for in beds?
330000	332000	Yeah, those pillows that they have.
332000	333000	When you sit up in bed...
333000	335000	No, we don't know, Dan. Explain it to us.
335000	338000	Oh, because you all are rock climbing. Fuck off.
338000	341000	You all know.
341000	345000	When you sit up in bed, the headboard hurts.
345000	350000	You put some pillows behind your back and those pillows shift around.
350000	353000	These things are called boyfriend pillows.
353000	358000	Those little nubs that come around and it's just enough to anchor you.
358000	363000	It just cements you like a little barnacle against the headboard.
363000	366000	Are you quitting?
366000	369000	Are you that outraged about my physical fitness?
369000	372000	Is the pillow supposed to be your boyfriend?
372000	375000	Why is it a boyfriend pillow? A boyfriend for whom?
375000	378000	My theory is that the reason it's called a boyfriend pillow...
378000	380000	And by the way, there's other things.
380000	383000	The nomenclature is confusing because women have...
383000	386000	I don't know if I should refer to them as a gender.
386000	389000	I don't know if a guy invented this or a woman.
389000	392000	I know the gender didn't invent them, so I shouldn't say women have.
392000	399000	But for women, they have those simulated boyfriend pillows.
399000	402000	They're like body pillows for snuddling.
402000	409000	And God knows men have all kinds of things that have nothing to do with sleeping that are simulations.
409000	412000	But the thing that's technically called a boyfriend pillow...
412000	415000	I believe the reason it's called a boyfriend pillow, I would imagine, is because...
415000	419000	This is not a romantic thing. This is a relationship thing.
419000	423000	This is a guy's over at your house, but he doesn't...
423000	428000	He might not fuck you. You might just watch, like, Ironside or something.
428000	433000	So it's a boyfriend pillow. It's a nesting pillow.
433000	436000	It has a time machine that goes back when Ironside is on the air.
437000	440000	You don't even know. He doesn't even know.
440000	442000	They redid Ironside.
442000	443000	They did?
443000	444000	Yeah.
444000	447000	Dan, I don't have a boyfriend.
447000	449000	Wait, so it's got little arm rests, right?
449000	452000	Yeah, Ironside does. Otherwise, he'd fall out of his chair.
452000	456000	No, I know. I know Ironside has arm rests.
456000	458000	Oh, now he's an Ironside expert.
458000	464000	Well, if you had been to IronCon, you would know that they remade the series.
464000	467000	It's now canceled, but they...
467000	469000	They rebooted Ironside?
469000	471000	For about three weeks. They gave it a shot.
471000	476000	They thought the reason the first Ironside failed was maybe because the guy was fat and white.
476000	479000	So they put a very sexy black man in a wheelchair,
479000	484000	but they kept flashing back to when he had use of his legs as if to apologize.
484000	486000	Like, he's not always crippled.
486000	492000	And they would do scenes like...
492000	497000	I only know about this because I was actually on The Soup, so I saw one of these clips.
497000	503000	He would roll into a room and be investigating a crime scene,
503000	506000	and then he says, he goes,
506000	513000	Yeah, so-and-so was scared all right, but not because of the drugs, because of that gun.
513000	516000	And he points at a gun that's under a pillow on a couch,
516000	518000	and all the other cops at the crime scene go,
518000	520000	How did you see that?
520000	524000	And he goes, I got a different view of the world from down here.
524000	528000	I'm not fucking kidding.
528000	535000	It was one of The Soup's clip of the years, because it's so fucking insane.
535000	540000	The idea that forensic science is somehow altitude biased.
540000	542000	Guys, get in here.
542000	546000	I'm the chief of police. I want everyone to enter every crime scene at a different level.
546000	553000	Yeah, I need two six-year-olds, a chihuahua, a great Dane, and a giraffe.
553000	558000	I want a really tall guy on another guy's shoulders wearing the world's longest trench coat.
558000	561000	Just walk through, don't touch anything, but just look around.
561000	563000	If you see a gun, tell me.
563000	568000	Someone teach this giraffe how to recognize guns and speak.
569000	571000	All right.
571000	574000	Get rid of these eucalyptus leaf pillows.
574000	579000	It's going to defeat the whole purpose when the koala comes in.
579000	581000	I don't know what I'm looking back at this for.
581000	583000	There's a structure to the show.
583000	586000	Have you guys ever amazed yourself at how sedentary you've become?
586000	588000	Is there a moment when you look at each other and go,
588000	589000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
589000	592000	Every fucking minute.
592000	595000	Yeah, we are so happy.
596000	600000	Sometimes there's just a weekend they just go,
600000	604000	We just watch nine movies in a row.
604000	606000	That's what heaven should be.
606000	608000	So you never look at that.
608000	610000	I don't want you to. I root for your happiness at all times.
610000	613000	But you don't ever look at those moments with a sense of alarm.
616000	618000	Maybe this is terrible.
619000	625000	I mean, I'd rather you just come out and say whatever you're trying to say
625000	628000	than this deposition.
628000	631000	Just charge me with whatever you're going to charge me with.
631000	634000	I mean, I love a woman. I don't love hiking.
636000	638000	I love her. She loves me.
638000	643000	I would rather watch 27 dresses than exercise.
644000	649000	She would rather watch a buckaroo bonsai than exercise.
649000	653000	So even though she hates buckaroo bonsai and I hate 27 dresses,
653000	656000	like we both love not moving.
656000	659000	We share each other's favorite movies with each other.
659000	660000	It's heaven.
660000	663000	And then like some every once in a while the doorbell rings and bing bong.
663000	666000	Oh, sausages are here.
666000	669000	And is it like a Mexican standoff of who has to get out of bed?
669000	672000	Absolutely. Yes, that'll be our undoing.
672000	675000	It's like the treasure of Sierra Madre.
676000	679000	As soon as I get up, you steal my pillow, huh?
680000	682000	Did you buy the boyfriend pillow or did she purchase that for you?
682000	684000	I didn't know what it was called.
684000	686000	I was like, I want one of those things. It's time now.
686000	687000	It's finally time.
687000	689000	I'm finally with a woman that I love enough
689000	693000	that I want to just smuck up to the headboard.
694000	695000	Smuck up?
695000	696000	Smuck up.
696000	699000	Smuck up, motherfucker.
699000	700000	You smuck up.
700000	702000	See, I don't want to sit up in bed.
702000	705000	I don't want a TV in my bedroom.
705000	707000	I don't want to sit up and read in my bedroom.
707000	709000	I want to go to bed in my bedroom
709000	712000	or do naked things in my bedroom.
713000	714000	Well, big deal.
714000	716000	What do you want, a cookie?
717000	718000	I feel like, I don't know.
718000	720000	I know something about when you say these things.
720000	722000	It feels challenging.
722000	724000	See, but you feel challenged by anything.
724000	726000	You don't like when someone says tie your shoes.
726000	728000	Well, I feel challenged by getting out of bed, certainly.
728000	729000	Yes.
729000	730000	Maybe, yeah.
730000	733000	But I also felt like you always go like,
733000	735000	oh, I ate a bunch of lasagna yesterday.
735000	736000	I just fucking pigged out.
736000	737000	I love lasagna.
737000	738000	And you go like, yeah, overeating.
738000	739000	I don't like overeating.
739000	740000	I was like, fuck off.
740000	741000	Fuck off.
741000	742000	Fuck off.
742000	743000	I've never said that.
743000	744000	I know you never have.
744000	746000	It's a fucking ersatz example.
746000	748000	It's a reconstruction of, like,
748000	750000	I'm running a Jeff simulator.
751000	753000	I'm in the, I'm in the Jeffatorium.
753000	756000	I'm like, oh, I just go, you know,
756000	758000	I just go like, oh, I was in the bathroom.
758000	761000	And then I, the guy,
761000	763000	we were trying to both get out the men's room door.
763000	765000	And we did one of those dances of awkwardness
765000	766000	before we could go.
766000	767000	And you're like, I always know,
767000	768000	I always know how to get through a bathroom door.
768000	769000	Fuck off.
769000	770000	Fuck off.
770000	772000	Why are you, why, why is, why?
772000	774000	Why do you always know?
775000	776000	It's too perfect.
776000	778000	He's like, like, like, Jeff.
778000	780000	Because I don't have a boyfriend pillow.
781000	783000	Life is my boyfriend pillow, Dan.
783000	784000	I have a challenge for you, Jeff,
784000	785000	because you're a music fan.
785000	786000	All right.
786000	787000	This is a new segment.
787000	788000	People like segments.
788000	789000	That's what I've learned recently.
790000	792000	People, even though it's fake,
792000	793000	it kind of enhances your enjoyment.
793000	794000	People like segments.
794000	797000	So that's, this segment is called music.
797000	799000	Hey, before you say segment,
799000	801000	do I need music cue for this musical segment?
801000	802000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
802000	804000	So give me a, like, a genre.
804000	805000	So let me know.
805000	806000	Thematically, what are you going for here?
806000	810000	It's about music and an investigation and,
810000	812000	and just America and...
816000	818000	and, uh, Auschwitz.
818000	819000	All right.
819000	820000	Okay.
820000	821000	Wait.
821000	823000	Music, investigation, America.
823000	824000	Yeah.
824000	825000	Auschwitz.
825000	826000	Oh, you heard that.
826000	827000	Okay.
827000	828000	No, that last one was a joke.
828000	829000	We all heard it.
829000	830000	A hilarious joke.
830000	831000	We all heard it.
831000	832000	But it's funny.
832000	833000	I think I have all those covered.
833000	834000	All right.
834000	835000	Are you ready?
835000	836000	John Denver.
839000	840000	Right.
843000	844000	Music corner.
844000	845000	Music corner.
845000	846000	Music.
846000	847000	Hey, there's another guy singing.
847000	848000	Wait, wait, wait.
848000	850000	Oh, you, you, you didn't say instrumental.
851000	853000	Well, I don't, I didn't know I...
853000	854000	All right.
854000	855000	Okay.
855000	856000	Let's do a...
856000	857000	All right.
857000	859000	This segment's called picking a, just a song for, uh,
859000	860000	for this segment.
860000	862000	Destin, I got no audio down here.
862000	864000	Something weird going on?
867000	868000	Uh...
868000	869000	It doesn't matter.
869000	870000	I heard...
870000	871000	There we go.
871000	872000	Fuck it.
872000	873000	Oh, okay.
875000	877000	It's music theory segment.
877000	882000	We're gonna talk to Jeff about some music questions.
882000	884000	And nothing rhymes with Jeff.
884000	887000	It's time for a chef and treble clef.
887000	890000	Well, that's too asshole.
894000	896000	I was gonna say your chin was clef.
896000	899000	But I stopped the song, so go fuck yourself.
899000	900000	All right.
900000	903000	So musical, musical segment.
903000	904000	All right.
904000	905000	Jeff.
905000	907000	The Dolly Parton song, Jolene.
907000	908000	Yes.
908000	910000	San Francisco native Dolly Parton.
910000	914000	I'm, I'm pretending that this is related to...
914000	917000	San Francisco born Dolly Parton.
917000	922000	Inventor of the typewriter and, uh, uh, uh,
922000	924000	friend of Abby Hoffman.
928000	932000	Hate Ashbury, frozen yogurt pioneer and singer-songwriter.
932000	933000	Dolly Parton.
933000	934000	Right.
934000	938000	Uh, she wrote this song, performed the song, Jolene.
938000	939000	Right.
939000	942000	Okay, so we're real familiar with the song Jolene.
942000	945000	It's Dolly Parton pleading with, uh,
945000	949000	the object of her, her lover's desire.
949000	952000	In other words, the woman that's gonna, gonna take her man.
952000	957000	She's pleading with her, please, Jolene, don't, don't do this, please.
957000	961000	Uh, my betrothed and I were discussing this, this song earlier.
961000	964000	Erin was saying when she, she was in a situation
964000	966000	where she was very jealous of a young lady.
966000	970000	She felt like, like her relationship was in the crosshairs of a succubus.
970000	975000	And she, she, the, the, Jolene came on at the, at the Vesuvio
975000	979000	and she, she had this flashback to when she was playing Jolene so much
979000	982000	that her, uh, her friend asked her to stop.
982000	984000	You can't listen to Jolene anymore.
984000	988000	But that, like, and it, it, it, it, it made me curious because I felt,
988000	996000	like, interesting, like, women and men, they different.
996000	1001000	Women, women drive like this.
1001000	1012000	Uh, no, uh, the, the, women, women and men both, uh, we all have love songs.
1012000	1014000	We all have painful songs.
1014000	1017000	Like we all go, uh, we've all, there's, there's, there's,
1017000	1020000	there's, there's, there's people of both genders and, uh, on both sides
1020000	1023000	of the listener-singer relationship.
1023000	1026000	We're all, we're all very familiar with the idea of a song about how
1026000	1030000	somebody broke my heart, somebody's fucking with me, somebody, uh,
1030000	1035000	and we're also familiar, uh, uh, but more especially on the male side, I think.
1035000	1038000	I'll probably get corrected on this, but the, on the male side,
1038000	1043000	there's a heavy tradition of, like, uh, guys talking to guys,
1043000	1046000	but it's usually about sniping.
1046000	1048000	It's, it's, you're gonna lose that girl.
1048000	1050000	I'm gonna fuck your girl.
1050000	1054000	Yes, I'll make a point of fucking that girl instead of you.
1054000	1056000	Yes, yes, I will.
1056000	1059000	Uh, I wish that I had Jesse's girl.
1059000	1064000	Oh, well, how come Jesse gets to fuck that girl instead of me?
1064000	1067000	Um, it's like when, when, when, when guys are referring to other guys-
1067000	1070000	By the way, the, the goodness is we can air that and we won't get sued.
1071000	1075000	Tone deafness has its legal advantages.
1076000	1079000	There's a guy from ASCAP, damn it.
1080000	1084000	So, well, five notes, four notes, six notes, shit.
1084000	1086000	He doesn't know what he's doing.
1086000	1088000	Can't pin him down.
1088000	1093000	Uh, it'd be like if, uh, if Al Capone was so bad at bookkeeping
1093000	1095000	that the IRS could never, uh, shit.
1095000	1097000	He doesn't know how to add anywhere.
1097000	1099000	It just says he bought a bunch of cookies.
1100000	1105000	Um, both sets of books, his cooked books and his real books is just cookies.
1105000	1107000	He loves cookies. That's all we can tell.
1107000	1109000	They're actual cookbooks.
1111000	1113000	His cooked books are cookbooks.
1113000	1115000	That's what I just said.
1115000	1117000	I know that's what you said. I'm refining it.
1117000	1118000	It feels like a challenge.
1118000	1119000	Stop challenging me.
1119000	1120000	Fuck you.
1120000	1124000	Every time we come to San Francisco, the city of brotherly love-
1124000	1125000	No, it's not.
1125000	1129000	As it is known, birthplace of Dolly Parton.
1129000	1132000	Epicenter of the typewriter.
1133000	1134000	Wasn't invented here.
1134000	1137000	This is where the most typewriters live.
1137000	1138000	Yeah.
1138000	1140000	Uh, anyways, where the fuck was I?
1140000	1141000	So, okay.
1141000	1142000	Jolene.
1142000	1144000	And by the way, I'm riveted to find out where you're going with this.
1144000	1146000	Well, no, I think it's a very interesting because I really,
1146000	1149000	I really kind of ran this over in my head and I'm interested to find out
1149000	1150000	if there's an answer to this.
1150000	1152000	Okay, so I'll cut to the chase.
1152000	1155000	Um, because Jolene is a very special song.
1155000	1158000	Even because I started talking to Aaron about it.
1158000	1160000	I said, well, it's a very interesting song.
1160000	1165000	I think men, men are all caught up in, in their testosterone politics.
1165000	1169000	Like you, if a man feels threatened sexually by another man,
1169000	1173000	he's not typically in a songwriting sense going to tend to express that
1173000	1177000	by going, Kevin, hey, take it easy on me.
1177000	1182000	I know you got a bigger dick, but you maybe explore other options
1182000	1185000	because I love my wife so much.
1185000	1187000	I'm just begging you, Kevin, come on.
1188000	1191000	Do me a solid this one time.
1191000	1195000	It's just, it's not an instinctive choice for a man.
1195000	1199000	And Aaron immediately said like, well, women, you know, they,
1199000	1203000	I don't want to, I don't want to mischaracterize her as making sweeping generalizations.
1203000	1206000	But we were just generally talking about this.
1206000	1211000	She's like, well, women are socialized to communicate and they,
1211000	1214000	they have, they, they, you can't, if you're a woman and there's a,
1214000	1218000	and you have that sort of a competitive relationship with another woman,
1218000	1226000	the woman who, who, who leaps into aggressiveness doesn't do herself any favors.
1226000	1229000	There's a sort of trapped claustrophobic, helpless feeling about it.
1229000	1233000	And the reason that song is a hit song and resonates with all of us,
1233000	1238000	of all genders, including the third secret one,
1238000	1243000	is, is, is because, is because it's like,
1243000	1248000	we all know what it's like to feel like just fucking at the mercy of another human being.
1248000	1253000	But so my question to you is, as a fan of music,
1253000	1257000	is there a male equivalent to Jolene,
1257000	1263000	specifically a man, songwriter, singer, addressing another man?
1263000	1266000	Yes. Bird dog by Everly Brothers.
1266000	1269000	That's a third person. He's a bird dog. He's warning other people.
1269000	1270000	He's going to fuck your joke.
1270000	1273000	Johnny is a joker. He's, he calls him up by name.
1273000	1274000	Johnny is a joker. He's a bird.
1274000	1276000	He's talking to the listener.
1276000	1279000	Is there a shit? Is there a song where a guy calls out another guy?
1279000	1285000	One guy saying to another guy, hey, Tim, you're an ace coxman.
1285000	1288000	Let's, let's agree on that.
1288000	1289000	Let's agree on that.
1289000	1290000	Let's prove it out back.
1290000	1294000	You got a big turgid piece of drill bit down there.
1294000	1299000	I just appreciate you going somewhere else out of, out of mercy.
1299000	1302000	I'm out of options. Signed, Kevin.
1302000	1306000	The closest, I will open that up to the floor.
1306000	1308000	The closest I can get is bird dog, where a guy says,
1308000	1311000	Johnny is trying to bird dog my lady.
1311000	1313000	But he says, hey, bird dog in the chorus.
1313000	1315000	He goes, hey, bird dog, get away with my quail.
1315000	1317000	Hey, bird dog, you're on the wrong trail.
1317000	1320000	He's just like, hey, fucking bird dog, leave my lovey dove alone.
1320000	1323000	Right. But he is, he's also still warning him off.
1323000	1325000	I want to open this up to the crowd.
1325000	1328000	If anybody thinks that they, you know, that they know of a song, sorry, what?
1328000	1329000	Tell her no.
1329000	1330000	Tell her no by the zombies.
1330000	1331000	Oh yeah.
1331000	1332000	Tell her no by the zombies.
1332000	1334000	She should tell you that she loves you.
1334000	1336000	I just remembered she said that to me.
1336000	1337000	Oh yeah.
1337000	1339000	Tell her no, no, no.
1339000	1342000	Anthony, tell her no, no, no.
1342000	1345000	Wait, so, wait, so you're saying tell her no.
1345000	1347000	You should tell her, come up on stage.
1347000	1349000	All right, well, if you want, if you want.
1349000	1350000	Let's bring him up on stage.
1350000	1354000	Grab a microphone here, would you?
1354000	1357000	Hans, that's a musical name. I love it.
1357000	1361000	There's a line in Tell Her No by the Zombies where he says specifically,
1361000	1366000	if she should tell you that I love you, just remember she said that to me.
1366000	1369000	There's another line, I think, where he says don't take her love from my arms.
1369000	1370000	Stuff like that.
1370000	1372000	Oh, tell her no.
1372000	1373000	Tell her no.
1373000	1377000	It's one guy talking to the guy saying, if my girlfriend throws herself at you,
1377000	1378000	do me a favor.
1378000	1379000	Ex-girlfriend.
1379000	1382000	And be a Teflon penis.
1382000	1383000	Pretty much, yeah.
1383000	1387000	Just man to man, that's all I can ask.
1387000	1391000	But he's not saying don't steal her away from me or release her.
1391000	1393000	I'm saying, if she comes to you...
1393000	1395000	He's saying stop fucking my ex-girlfriend.
1395000	1396000	He is.
1396000	1400000	Or is he saying, in the event that she tries to fuck you, tell her no?
1400000	1404000	Is he saying stop fucking her or tell her no in the event that she tries to?
1404000	1405000	Right, right, right.
1405000	1406000	No, that's good.
1407000	1412000	I think what it is is that, you know, let's say it's Tony and Johnny.
1412000	1415000	And Johnny is fucking Tony's ex-girlfriend.
1415000	1417000	And he's not into it.
1417000	1418000	He's bummed.
1418000	1420000	So he's saying, hey, fucking stop it.
1420000	1425000	Or maybe he's just saying like, hey, I love her and you're just fucking around with her.
1425000	1430000	And so, like, you know, if she says I love you, then take a hike because I'm the one who really loves her.
1430000	1431000	I don't know.
1431000	1432000	That's good, though.
1432000	1433000	That's close.
1433000	1434000	Thank you, Hans.
1434000	1435000	Hans, everybody.
1435000	1436000	Everybody else got that beat?
1436000	1437000	All right.
1437000	1441000	Do we have anybody else that has that beat for man-on-man thwarting?
1441000	1449000	Man-on-man acquiescence and pleading for non-sexual intervention.
1449000	1453000	I take a lot of long drives like doing comedy shows with Greg Proops and Ryan Stiles.
1453000	1456000	We were talking about the kind of weird...
1456000	1462000	I mean, this is not going to win any awards for naming it, but we call it kind of like rape rock.
1462000	1466000	Where it's like, young girl, get out of my life.
1466000	1471000	A guy yelling at an underage woman to stop putting the sauce on him.
1471000	1474000	Don't stand with all the charms of a woman.
1474000	1475000	You're just a baby.
1475000	1480000	You're talking specifically about men saying to young women, like, get away from me?
1480000	1481000	Yeah.
1481000	1483000	That's a terrible genre.
1483000	1484000	Don't stand so close to me yet.
1484000	1487000	But then there's the other more horrible thing, which is...
1487000	1489000	I don't understand.
1489000	1491000	It's like, she's 16.
1491000	1492000	She's beautiful.
1492000	1494000	And she's like, what?
1494000	1495000	You're 48.
1495000	1496000	Yes.
1496000	1497000	Yes.
1497000	1498000	She's 16.
1498000	1499000	She's beautiful.
1499000	1502000	And in four years, the laws will change because of this song.
1502000	1503000	Oh, yeah.
1503000	1504000	No, no.
1504000	1505000	Sorry.
1505000	1506000	Hey, little sister, don't you?
1506000	1507000	That one.
1507000	1509000	Like he's talking about the girl he's dating.
1509000	1511000	He's more into the little sister.
1511000	1515000	I used to pull your pigtails and twist your turned up nose.
1515000	1517000	Now I'm looking at your titties.
1517000	1520000	Oh, it's fucking on.
1520000	1524000	And you get the feeling from little sister that it's because he's been rebuffed by the
1524000	1528000	older sister and now he's just gone younger, which is a fucking Elvis.
1528000	1533000	Also, Elvis isn't a film, if I'm not mistaken, called Kissing Cousins.
1533000	1538000	And there's a song about, like, I forget how the lyrics go, but they're pretty fucking
1538000	1540000	good in the sense that they're horrifying.
1540000	1544000	And he says, like, she does this and she does that.
1544000	1545000	We hug and sneeze.
1545000	1546000	Not hug.
1546000	1548000	We don't hug and sneeze all night.
1548000	1554000	But we're kissing cousins and that's what makes it all right.
1554000	1556000	Like, they're kissing cousins.
1556000	1560000	I think it means legally allowed to fuck cousins.
1560000	1561000	I don't know.
1561000	1562000	Oh, okay.
1562000	1566000	The term, he's saying we're kissing cousins, meaning we're not first cousins.
1566000	1569000	We're not blood related cousins and that's what makes it okay.
1569000	1571000	Second cousins, yeah.
1571000	1572000	See, I have a small family.
1572000	1574000	I don't even know if I have a cousin.
1574000	1575000	I probably do.
1575000	1576000	I don't know them.
1576000	1579000	I bet you'd make out with her if you did.
1579000	1583000	You're not better than these southern people.
1583000	1588000	We judge them, but they just have more cousins.
1588000	1594000	I think that we in the blue state metropolitan areas, we go like, oh, they all
1594000	1595000	fuck each other.
1595000	1597000	They all fuck their cousins.
1597000	1600000	We just don't have many cousins.
1601000	1604000	If you have, once you get up to six, eight, nine cousins, one of them's going to
1604000	1607000	really sweep you off your feet.
1607000	1610000	And that's what can happen down there where there's more room and there's
1610000	1613000	swing sets and stuff and there's just fields.
1613000	1614000	You know, they don't have...
1614000	1616000	This potato sack racing?
1616000	1617000	Yeah.
1617000	1618000	Who knows what goes on in those potato sacks?
1618000	1619000	Yeah.
1619000	1625000	Where we have a YMCA or a Walmart, they have like just weathering heights of wheat.
1625000	1626000	I don't know.
1626000	1627000	Okay.
1627000	1629000	Weathering heights.
1630000	1634000	Mixed a couple geological and cultural things there.
1634000	1635000	All right.
1635000	1637000	So, well, I kind of got sidetracked.
1637000	1639000	I want tonight to run cleanly.
1639000	1640000	I don't want to get off on any tangents.
1640000	1641000	No tangents.
1641000	1642000	No tangents.
1642000	1643000	Because we're in San Francisco.
1643000	1645000	I don't want to create the false impression.
1645000	1646000	Can we talk real quick?
1646000	1647000	Well, can I go off on one...
1647000	1648000	It's not really a tangent.
1648000	1651000	It's just a brief interjection.
1651000	1656000	Walking up Columbus here in North Beach, one of my favorite neighborhoods in
1656000	1658000	San Francisco, a town which I deeply love and adore.
1658000	1659000	I love coming here.
1659000	1660000	We were supposed to...
1660000	1661000	They were going to...
1661000	1664000	The Sketchfest people were going to bring us in tonight, fly us back tomorrow morning,
1664000	1668000	and all of us agreed separately that we would stay an extra day just to be here in this
1668000	1669000	lovely city.
1669000	1670000	Because it is the best.
1670000	1675000	Because you can come to North Beach, and I went to a bar, and there was
1675000	1678000	Fernet Bronca on tap, like next to the beers.
1678000	1679000	And it was...
1679000	1683000	It's serotonin just poured out of the back of my brain and on my butts.
1683000	1684000	It was the best.
1684000	1685000	Because that's how it works, right?
1685000	1686000	Pour it out of your butt?
1686000	1687000	Yes.
1687000	1688000	We'll get back to that.
1688000	1690000	I'm walking up the road, and I'm going...
1690000	1692000	You guys were at Vesuvio having a drink, and I was...
1692000	1695000	I got out of a cab, and I wanted to go get a pizza at a certain place.
1695000	1701000	And I hopped out of the cab, and I crossed the street, like, near, like, Stockton, Green,
1701000	1702000	Columbus, the run there.
1702000	1706000	And there was a big black guy, youngish, you know, I would say not...
1706000	1708000	Maybe just 30, maybe less.
1708000	1709000	Big guy.
1709000	1711000	Football jersey.
1711000	1715000	I think for some reason it was, like, Vikings or Green Bay, but something Midwest-y.
1715000	1718000	It wasn't like the Niners or anything local.
1718000	1720000	And he had a football.
1720000	1723000	And he was standing, like, waiting at the crosswalk, and he was, like, tapping the football.
1723000	1724000	Jesus.
1724000	1725000	He was, like, really out of his way.
1725000	1726000	Yeah, well...
1726000	1727000	Yeah.
1727000	1729000	But he was just standing there, like, you know, it's like this...
1729000	1732000	Didn't bother me at all, didn't really pay much attention.
1732000	1733000	Left, went and had pizza.
1733000	1734000	Come back.
1734000	1737000	He's still there at the same crosswalk, and now I'm stuck at that crosswalk waiting on
1737000	1738000	a green light.
1738000	1741000	And he's still there, and we're now waiting to cross the street.
1741000	1744000	But I know this guy enough to know he's not crossing that street.
1744000	1749000	Because he was there an hour ago, tapping that football, kind of shifting from left
1749000	1750000	to right.
1750000	1754000	And he looks over, and I'm wearing a suit, and I got a tie on, and I'm carrying a book
1754000	1759000	and a little zippy case from my iPad that I DJ'd the show with.
1759000	1760000	So I...
1760000	1761000	And he just looks over at me, and we're...
1761000	1765000	We're about, like, our heads are about a foot and a half apart waiting next to each other.
1765000	1766000	And he goes...
1766000	1767000	Fucking faggot.
1770000	1771000	Tapping the football.
1771000	1772000	Now more.
1772000	1773000	Faggot.
1773000	1774000	Fuck.
1774000	1775000	Look at this faggot.
1775000	1776000	Look at this faggot.
1776000	1777000	Faggot.
1777000	1778000	Faggot.
1778000	1780000	And an electric green, and I just kept trucking.
1780000	1782000	And then he...
1782000	1784000	I told it to Erin backstage.
1784000	1787000	She's like, wrong city.
1787000	1789000	I did not see that coming.
1789000	1790000	No.
1790000	1791000	Was he talking to you about it?
1791000	1793000	Well, I think he probably has Tourette's, but it was for me.
1793000	1794000	It was certainly for my...
1794000	1797000	He wasn't bonding with you, like, looking at, like...
1797000	1800000	He looked at me, and he didn't like what he was seeing.
1800000	1801000	Because I had a suit on.
1801000	1804000	I mean, look, he might have called everybody that moved a faggot.
1804000	1806000	Well, I mean...
1806000	1809000	I'm the only person I heard him say that to.
1809000	1817000	I love that he's so gay that he has to carry a football around in order to get away with calling people faggot.
1817000	1824000	Because he's afraid that the absence of a football will be the equivalent of the presence of a dildo.
1824000	1826000	That's how gay that guy is.
1826000	1830000	I often hear rampant homophobia as latent homosexuality.
1830000	1832000	Because I think, like, if you protest that...
1832000	1833000	I'm a firm believer in it.
1833000	1839000	Yeah, and I thought, if this guy's cruising, he's doing it the most high-concept way of all time.
1839000	1841000	Well, I don't think they're all cruising.
1841000	1843000	I think they're... I mean, but no.
1843000	1847000	I am an absolute firm believer that if you are...
1847000	1854000	When you are that energetically opposed to a victimless crime,
1855000	1858000	it is because you are jealous, period.
1858000	1860000	I don't understand...
1860000	1863000	That's not just me left-winging it.
1863000	1867000	I've got all kinds of crazy political views.
1867000	1869000	I'm not a political person, but...
1869000	1874000	If you sense a threat that you're not being threatened by, then that seems...
1874000	1877000	It's just... It's too suspicious.
1877000	1881000	And we've also found out too many times, over and over and over again,
1881000	1883000	that these people are like, like, like, like,
1883000	1885000	I'm gonna make a law against buttholes!
1885000	1888000	Everyone's butthole has to have an eye patch over it,
1888000	1892000	because the homosexuals keep trying to make everyone gay!
1892000	1896000	It's like, okay, and then you find out he's in an airport, you know,
1896000	1900000	and he's, like, got three dicks in his armpits, and...
1900000	1902000	And it's just, like, over and over and over again.
1902000	1904000	Which is, for me, needlessly gay.
1904000	1908000	Well, because he's doing it wrong, because he's not healthy about it.
1908000	1911000	He needs to go to, like, gay camp and...
1911000	1914000	Like, hang out with gay people and ask, do you put them in your armpits
1914000	1917000	and have them say, no, sweetie, you don't.
1917000	1919000	Take it easy.
1919000	1921000	Lick it, kiss it, suck it.
1921000	1923000	You don't have to put it in your eyeball.
1923000	1926000	You don't have to go to a fucking rest stop for it.
1926000	1930000	First of all, why are you married? Get that in order.
1930000	1932000	Like, you know, there's people waiting out there
1932000	1935000	to mentor you in gayness, if you...
1935000	1937000	You can find them.
1937000	1940000	Long story short, I'm fucking this guy.
1940000	1943000	And I mean...
1943000	1945000	I mean fucking him.
1945000	1947000	All right, so I...
1947000	1949000	Write the old armpits.
1949000	1952000	With all three of my dicks, because that's the thing.
1952000	1954000	If you've got three dicks, fuck the armpits,
1954000	1956000	because where else are you gonna do it?
1956000	1958000	I never finished my...
1958000	1960000	So, the first part of my experiment...
1960000	1964000	The saying is, one in the shit, two in the pit.
1965000	1968000	I'm not even absorbing this, because I'm moving on.
1970000	1973000	Just trying to educate our audience a little bit.
1976000	1981000	If you can state it in a rhyme, you can justify a sex crime.
1983000	1985000	On the playground, they were always like,
1985000	1987000	if there's grass on the field, play ball.
1987000	1991000	If the river's red, take the dirt road instead.
1991000	1993000	No, is that one?
1993000	1994000	Yes, yes.
1994000	1995000	Is that real?
1995000	1996000	Well, is it real?
1996000	1997000	I mean, is it real?
1997000	1999000	Yes, it's a real thing that I heard.
1999000	2002000	I thought you just riffed that, and I was gonna fucking...
2002000	2004000	Thomas Jefferson didn't say it.
2005000	2007000	To my knowledge, but...
2007000	2009000	That is horrifying.
2009000	2013000	But it says, yeah, these sayings, these slogans.
2015000	2018000	Which, by the way, are more clever than today's modern beer slogans,
2018000	2021000	which are just like, down for what's up.
2023000	2027000	Hey, yo, hashtag Bud Light.
2027000	2030000	If you love Bud Light, hashtag Bud Light.
2030000	2032000	Hi, how are ya?
2033000	2035000	All the beer slogans are always like...
2035000	2037000	Remember when they were really Orwellian?
2037000	2039000	Like, why ask why?
2039000	2042000	I remember that one. That was fucked up.
2042000	2044000	A lot of you guys are 25.
2044000	2047000	There was a beer over what brand it was.
2047000	2050000	Their slogan was, why ask why?
2050000	2052000	That's fucked up.
2052000	2055000	When your product is an opiate.
2055000	2058000	Why ask why?
2058000	2060000	I keep hearing why.
2060000	2063000	There's a Madison Avenue boardroom, and a guy comes in,
2063000	2067000	and it's like, well, it seems like our biggest opponent
2067000	2071000	to people buying beers, sometimes people keep asking why.
2072000	2077000	Yeah, well, maybe we can turn the tables on them.
2077000	2080000	It's the way that you use it.
2081000	2084000	Camera pushes down a 21-year-old Johnny Madison.
2084000	2086000	Before that, the boss said,
2086000	2088000	I'm sick of being told why people should drink beer.
2088000	2090000	I'll tell you why.
2090000	2092000	And then a young guy goes...
2092000	2094000	Mr. Jenkins.
2094000	2096000	What is it? Bring me coffee.
2096000	2098000	You keep saying you don't like the word why.
2098000	2101000	If you say why one more time, if you even use why in a sentence...
2101000	2103000	What if I said it twice?
2103000	2106000	Why ask why?
2106000	2108000	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
2108000	2111000	I got your job now. I got your job.
2114000	2117000	You guys don't know that we're also gifted actors.
2117000	2118000	Please.
2118000	2120000	We bring so much...
2120000	2122000	I know Jodie Foster was here last Wednesday.
2122000	2124000	Did she do this?
2124000	2128000	No, she talked about alien contact.
2128000	2130000	Again.
2131000	2133000	It's like a broken record.
2133000	2134000	Leave it.
2134000	2136000	I believe we're gonna make contact.
2136000	2138000	I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
2138000	2142000	I'd like you to do a little more Jodie Foster impression for me.
2142000	2144000	All right, give me a suggestion.
2144000	2146000	Okay.
2146000	2148000	I heard rapping plumber.
2148000	2149000	Rapping plumber.
2149000	2150000	Give me a beat.
2150000	2151000	You want a beat?
2151000	2153000	Jodie Foster the rapping plumber.
2155000	2157000	Breakdown.
2157000	2159000	Jodie Foster.
2159000	2161000	Jodie Foster.
2161000	2163000	MC Jodie Foster in the house.
2163000	2166000	I'm coming to your house to plug your toilet.
2166000	2168000	I'm doing it wrong already.
2168000	2171000	I should be unplugging your toilet.
2171000	2174000	I can't handle this, Dr. Lecter.
2174000	2175000	Okay.
2175000	2177000	All right, that's dumb. That was stupid.
2177000	2179000	No, I know.
2179000	2181000	Fuck you for enjoying it.
2181000	2182000	You're bad people.
2182000	2183000	Yeah, that was not stupid.
2183000	2186000	Your joy makes you bad people.
2186000	2188000	That was high risk, high yield.
2189000	2192000	And you proved it by the risk, yielding nothing.
2192000	2194000	Yeah.
2197000	2201000	I got off on a tangent, but I was going to say two experiments that are going on.
2201000	2203000	They're kind of contradicting each other.
2203000	2204000	One is I'm owning it.
2204000	2205000	I'm fat.
2205000	2206000	Wait, wait.
2206000	2208000	That's how long ago we jumped the tracks.
2208000	2209000	Yeah.
2209000	2211000	That was like the third minute of the show.
2211000	2213000	Well, because you started making fun of me for being fat as I was owning my fat.
2213000	2214000	I was not making fun of you.
2214000	2216000	Well, you're wearing that black sweatshirt.
2217000	2219000	You fucking pudgy asshole.
2219000	2223000	See, now you're trying to hide your fat body from your fans.
2223000	2225000	And I was like, okay, whatever.
2225000	2226000	I'm saying you're not hiding it.
2226000	2230000	I'm saying the secrets are being given up.
2230000	2232000	Also, holy shit.
2232000	2234000	Owning it, owning anything.
2234000	2240000	If you got a zit on your forehead, you know, it's fine to be insecure about it.
2240000	2242000	But own it.
2242000	2244000	You got a zit on your forehead.
2244000	2245000	Here's what people like.
2245000	2246000	How do you own a zit in your head?
2246000	2248000	Well, here's a couple things people would be fine with.
2248000	2249000	And say this, Joey Foster.
2249000	2253000	I got a guy walking into the bar with a big zit on his forehead and going like,
2253000	2255000	hey, what's up?
2255000	2257000	Can I get you something?
2257000	2258000	I'll tell you what.
2258000	2259000	You can't.
2259000	2260000	You don't have to get me a zit on my forehead.
2260000	2262000	I'll take a, because I already got one.
2262000	2264000	I'll take a Bud Light.
2264000	2265000	A Bud Light.
2265000	2266000	I'm pointing at a Bud Light.
2266000	2267000	Why?
2267000	2268000	What?
2268000	2269000	Why?
2269000	2270000	Why ask why?
2270000	2271000	Give me a...
2272000	2273000	Dumb.
2273000	2274000	All right.
2274000	2275000	Thank you.
2275000	2276000	I got a zit on my forehead, but it's not...
2276000	2277000	It's not your problem.
2277000	2278000	I didn't bring it up.
2278000	2279000	I see all kinds in here.
2279000	2280000	Yeah.
2280000	2281000	There was a...
2281000	2282000	Well, here's a new kind.
2282000	2285000	A homophobic football player here a moment ago, and he was way weird with...
2285000	2286000	Hey, what is this place?
2286000	2287000	A fossil yard?
2287000	2289000	I'm going to put something on the jukebox.
2289000	2292000	I'm a zit forehead drinking a Bud Light.
2292000	2293000	So you like that guy.
2293000	2294000	Everyone likes that guy.
2294000	2295000	I hate that guy.
2295000	2296000	Well, he's...
2296000	2297000	Maybe it's in the back of it.
2297000	2298000	He's making it my problem.
2298000	2299000	I was fine.
2299000	2301000	Here's a guy you don't like for sure.
2301000	2302000	Okay.
2302000	2303000	All right.
2303000	2305000	Still got a zit on his forehead.
2305000	2306000	Who am I?
2306000	2307000	The bartender.
2307000	2308000	Whoever you were.
2308000	2309000	Okay.
2309000	2310000	The pharmacist.
2310000	2311000	I don't know who you are.
2311000	2312000	Whatever you want.
2312000	2316000	Hey, can I get a Bud Light?
2316000	2318000	It's going to go away in three weeks.
2318000	2319000	I'm sorry, sir.
2319000	2320000	This is a pharmacy.
2320000	2321000	This is not a bar.
2321000	2323000	I'll take a Band-Aid.
2323000	2325000	I'm just going to cover it up until...
2325000	2326000	You're not supposed to pop it, or you're not supposed to...
2326000	2328000	You don't have to talk to a pharmacist to get Band-Aids.
2328000	2330000	They're over there in aisle two.
2330000	2331000	All right.
2331000	2332000	Well, anyways, you get the idea.
2333000	2334000	Own it.
2334000	2336000	It's okay to say, like, okay, I'm fat.
2336000	2339000	I'd like to lose 40, 80 pounds before my wedding.
2339000	2341000	But until I do...
2341000	2342000	40, 80?
2342000	2343000	40, 80.
2343000	2344000	That's a good arrangement.
2344000	2345000	That's the spread.
2345000	2346000	All right.
2346000	2349000	You'd be happier with 80, or you'd be happy with 40?
2349000	2351000	We'd all be happier with 80.
2351000	2352000	How much do you weigh right now?
2352000	2353000	Do you know?
2353000	2354000	900.
2354000	2355000	I don't know.
2355000	2356000	You keep derailing me.
2356000	2357000	I'm just saying.
2357000	2358000	Yes, I'm fat, Jeff.
2358000	2359000	I didn't know you were fat.
2359000	2360000	I'm fat.
2361000	2362000	Why don't you...
2362000	2364000	Why don't you go marry skinny people?
2365000	2367000	You know, I'm fat, and I'm your friend.
2367000	2369000	I'm fat, and you love me.
2369000	2370000	What does that make you?
2370000	2372000	Fat man lover.
2372000	2373000	It's worse.
2373000	2375000	It's arguably worse.
2375000	2376000	That's why I'm...
2376000	2377000	Yeah, it's hard.
2377000	2379000	That's me not owning it, see?
2379000	2381000	That's me projecting all kinds of shame.
2381000	2383000	But if I come out like Santa Claus,
2383000	2385000	and I'm like, okay, I bet you guys do.
2385000	2386000	That's not what's gonna happen.
2386000	2387000	I'm not gonna do anything, you know?
2387000	2388000	I'm not gonna do anything.
2388000	2390000	But if I come out like Santa Claus, and I'm like,
2390000	2392000	well, who's got some presents?
2392000	2393000	Because he's so fat.
2393000	2394000	You're like...
2394000	2395000	You don't even think of...
2395000	2396000	You're like, oh.
2396000	2397000	No, that's not owning it.
2397000	2398000	Having presents because you're fat
2398000	2399000	is the opposite of owning it.
2399000	2401000	That's apologizing for being fat.
2401000	2402000	I'm done with the owning it part.
2402000	2404000	If you guys don't understand what owning it means,
2404000	2406000	you gotta Google it.
2406000	2407000	I'm done with that.
2407000	2408000	We're not gonna spend two hours on that.
2408000	2410000	There was one other thing.
2410000	2412000	I'm apologizing now.
2413000	2415000	Now, that's the opposite of owning it, isn't it?
2415000	2417000	Well, no, you could be owning your own guilt
2417000	2418000	to your own shame.
2418000	2420000	I've always had this thing where somebody...
2420000	2421000	When Erin says...
2421000	2423000	When she suggests that I did something wrong,
2423000	2425000	I defend myself.
2425000	2427000	Like, it's some kind of chess game.
2427000	2428000	Right.
2430000	2432000	We went to a pizza place today,
2432000	2434000	and they brought the plate of olive oil,
2434000	2436000	and I immediately took a salt shaker
2436000	2438000	and just put salt all over the olive oil,
2438000	2440000	because I want to dip my bread in the olive oil.
2440000	2442000	Yes, that's why I'm fat.
2443000	2444000	I'm eating bread in olive oil.
2444000	2446000	But I want to put the salt on the olive oil,
2446000	2448000	but it was the table's olive oil,
2448000	2449000	and Erin was like,
2449000	2451000	maybe someone else doesn't want salt.
2451000	2454000	And my first thought is like,
2454000	2457000	incoming tactical invasion,
2457000	2459000	perimeter defense,
2459000	2462000	how do you get out of apologizing for this?
2463000	2466000	Someone's implying that you're doing something wrong.
2466000	2468000	Prove that you're not.
2468000	2469000	And then you just engage in all these things.
2469000	2470000	It's like a chess game.
2470000	2471000	So what did you say?
2471000	2472000	What was your...
2472000	2473000	I was probably like,
2473000	2475000	fuck you, I'm paying for dinner.
2476000	2477000	I don't know what I did.
2477000	2479000	But then I was like, oh shit, yeah,
2479000	2482000	I realized when I got off the plane at San Francisco,
2482000	2486000	I want to apologize whenever I sense that moment,
2486000	2488000	even if I feel like it's...
2488000	2489000	Even who cares?
2489000	2491000	What's the worst case scenario?
2491000	2492000	You apologize for everything.
2492000	2494000	I'm sure there's people out here that apologize too much,
2494000	2496000	and they have to work on that or something.
2496000	2497000	They have to stick up for themselves.
2497000	2499000	I don't have that problem.
2499000	2502000	I could apologize a couple million times more often,
2502000	2505000	and I would break even in terms of the average person,
2505000	2509000	so I've just been practicing crunches,
2509000	2511000	even though it's kind of an absurd, comedic,
2511000	2514000	even quasi-passive, aggressive feel to it.
2514000	2519000	I'm just like, now I'm going to say that I'm sorry more often.
2519000	2520000	Well, you mean it when you say it,
2520000	2522000	or the piece of road thing that you're saying...
2522000	2523000	I don't know.
2523000	2525000	I mean it, shmeen it, you know?
2525000	2528000	It's not something that you're doing for someone else.
2528000	2530000	It's like saying gazoon type, you know?
2530000	2532000	Somebody goes like, oh, you did this thing,
2532000	2533000	and it's like...
2533000	2534000	No, it's not.
2534000	2538000	Being apologetic is actually being contrite.
2538000	2540000	No, you're talking about remorse.
2540000	2542000	Sometimes those things overlap,
2542000	2546000	but sometimes a graceful, excuse me, pardon me, I'm sorry.
2546000	2548000	That's certainly the least you can do.
2548000	2552000	You don't have to grovel and weep great tears about things.
2552000	2557000	When you say I'm sorry, it should resonate sincerely, right?
2557000	2558000	Yeah.
2558000	2561000	For instance, aren't you sorry for misunderstanding me just now?
2561000	2562000	Yes, I'm so sorry.
2563000	2565000	I'm sorry for interrupting this show.
2565000	2568000	Welcome, Joe Hodgson!
2568000	2571000	Hi there, buddy. Hello, Cobbs.
2574000	2576000	Joe Hodgson of Mystery Science Theater fame.
2576000	2578000	I was just going to bring you on.
2578000	2580000	Oh, really? I got confused.
2580000	2583000	I thought I was supposed to walk on like Bob Hope used to do
2583000	2584000	on the Tonight Show.
2584000	2586000	I told you to walk on, but then they texted me that you were here.
2586000	2588000	Let's do it again.
2588000	2589000	You got some music?
2589000	2591000	Yeah, I'll give you some music.
2591000	2592000	That's going to give you a proper intro.
2592000	2593000	Yeah, yeah.
2609000	2610000	You're supposed to do a showbiz intro.
2610000	2612000	Ladies and gentlemen!
2612000	2613000	You know him from...
2613000	2615000	No, I want to give a...
2615000	2616000	Oh, okay.
2616000	2623000	So, I asked Adam Savage to come on the show, and he said yes,
2623000	2624000	and then he said no.
2624000	2626000	The show was sold out anyway, so there's no one here that was coming
2626000	2627000	for Adam Savage.
2627000	2629000	Of MythBuster fame.
2629000	2630000	Right.
2630000	2633000	A guy who gets his hands in the dirt.
2633000	2639000	But we really lucked out in his absence because here in San Francisco
2639000	2644000	is really my first original actual mentor when I moved to L.A.,
2644000	2649000	when Shrab and I moved to L.A., the first Hollywood guy we ever talked to,
2649000	2653000	whoever talked to us about anything, was this guy and his brother.
2653000	2656000	He had created this show called Mystery Science Theater 3000
2656000	2658000	that I watched when I was in Milwaukee.
2658000	2662000	One of the most...
2662000	2667000	You know, it's just this beacon of inventiveness and do-it-yourselfness
2667000	2671000	and autonomy and Jim Hensony kind of like brilliance.
2671000	2676000	And here he was in L.A., and he was also from the Midwest,
2676000	2678000	so we had to connect...
2678000	2681000	He was able to translate L.A. into Midwestern terms for us
2681000	2683000	and show us the ropes a little bit.
2683000	2688000	And he's a god to me and a friend that I don't talk to enough,
2688000	2691000	but he's here in San Francisco, and I happened to catch him on text,
2691000	2692000	so he's here.
2692000	2694000	Please welcome Joel Hodgson!
2694000	2704000	Thank you so much. Wow.
2704000	2707000	I've never been to Cobbs before. It's like famous.
2707000	2711000	Isn't it? Well, yeah, there's pictures upstairs that are kind of intimidating.
2711000	2715000	There's Greg Giraldo in a kind of somber black and white photo
2715000	2716000	and a lot of like...
2716000	2719000	They laid the shit down at Cobbs.
2719000	2720000	Yeah.
2720000	2722000	Some riffin'. Yeah.
2722000	2726000	Back in the day, this is where they did The Last Waltz, right?
2726000	2727000	The band.
2727000	2728000	I don't know what is that?
2728000	2731000	You know, the concert movie, The Last Waltz.
2731000	2732000	Oh, yeah? Yeah.
2732000	2733000	It was here? Yeah.
2733000	2735000	Holy shit.
2735000	2736000	It's a...
2736000	2741000	That was Dolly Parton's last show, I believe, wasn't it?
2741000	2745000	It's a big room. It's intimidating.
2745000	2746000	Yeah, I know.
2746000	2748000	What were you doing out here in San Francisco?
2748000	2750000	Oh, I'm doing a show tomorrow night at the Brava Theater.
2750000	2752000	I'm doing riffing myself in a new one.
2752000	2755000	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, don't plug your bullshit!
2755000	2757000	What the fuck?
2757000	2758000	No, I don't know why.
2758000	2760000	That's a dumb joke I do.
2760000	2764000	I'm just a scene maker. I just come and drop in on you guys.
2764000	2766000	I'm sorry I didn't bring you out faster.
2766000	2768000	No, it's okay.
2768000	2771000	And I didn't know your shows were two hours long.
2771000	2773000	Like, I talked to Aaron.
2773000	2774000	I thought they were like an hour.
2774000	2775000	Like, it's a podcast.
2775000	2776000	I thought there were rules.
2776000	2778000	Lots of podcasts are two hours.
2778000	2779000	I didn't know that.
2779000	2780000	And my podcast has rules?
2780000	2781000	No, I... No.
2781000	2783000	We're doing an hour of 45 tonight tops.
2783000	2784000	A top. A tight...
2784000	2786000	But I was rushing to get over here.
2786000	2788000	I had another show and I was like going,
2788000	2790000	shit, I better get here or I'm not gonna make it in time.
2790000	2791000	And turns out...
2791000	2793000	The fucking burning time over here.
2793000	2794000	Yeah.
2794000	2797000	Yeah, a lot of these people probably had an 8 o'clock thing
2797000	2801000	they were gonna go to, or 8.30 or whatever. Fuck them.
2801000	2803000	No, you're in for the whole thing.
2803000	2804000	Yeah.
2804000	2805000	I hope you like this.
2805000	2806000	Because you're getting a lot of it.
2806000	2809000	Text your friend and tell him to watch Dana Gould
2809000	2814000	at Corny Pickles.
2814000	2816000	I think he's at Uncle Fucker's Chuckle Hut.
2816000	2817000	Uncle Fucker's Chuckle Hut.
2817000	2818000	Uncle Fucker's Chuckle Hut.
2818000	2819000	Uncle Fucker's Chuckle Hut.
2819000	2823000	I heard he was doing the midnight show at the Taj Mahaha.
2823000	2825000	That's the only all...
2825000	2826000	What the?
2826000	2827000	Late night.
2827000	2829000	Own it comes.
2829000	2830000	That's called owning it.
2830000	2834000	That, my friend...
2834000	2836000	Dan just took his shirt off and showed us the...
2836000	2847000	Oh dear heaven, yeah.
2847000	2854000	Get those dollars out, ladies.
2854000	2855000	Let's bring him out to the stage,
2855000	2859000	put it together for the Yeti.
2859000	2863000	I thought you'd have a lot more discolored skin.
2863000	2866000	I was expecting a lot more.
2866000	2871000	Just a sea of creamy white speckled with acne scars.
2871000	2873000	Did you ever think about grooming it,
2873000	2876000	cutting it back with one of those groomers?
2876000	2877000	You ever think about that?
2877000	2878000	Well, I have done it.
2878000	2879000	You have?
2879000	2880000	Yeah.
2880000	2885000	I mean, three days after I do it, it looks like this again.
2885000	2887000	Show me your back.
2887000	2888000	I don't want to...
2888000	2890000	Just show me.
2891000	2893000	Own it.
2893000	2896000	Let me see.
2896000	2899000	Because there'd be more welds.
2899000	2902000	I can't believe that he's entirely covered in nipples.
2902000	2903000	It's amazing.
2903000	2904000	Those are his kids.
2904000	2906000	It's almost entirely nipple.
2906000	2911000	I come from a long line of tall, very hairless Austrian men.
2911000	2914000	I'm very symmetrical.
2914000	2917000	If I get a pimple on one side of my face,
2917000	2919000	I get one exactly opposite.
2919000	2921000	Like a cyborg with pimples.
2921000	2922000	I'm not taking it off, lady.
2922000	2924000	Does everybody hear that?
2924000	2927000	When Jeff gets acne, it's also perfect.
2929000	2935000	Jesus fucking Monte Cristo.
2935000	2936000	That's not what I'm saying.
2936000	2938000	Perfect would be not having any.
2938000	2942000	I have one little hair that comes out on my right shoulder,
2942000	2944000	and I have one exactly on my left shoulder,
2944000	2946000	like little magical wings.
2946000	2950000	Little vestigial Pegasus wings.
2951000	2953000	And that's it.
2953000	2956000	Also, I shit glitter.
2957000	2959000	You come from a long line of Aryan men,
2959000	2960000	but there aren't any women.
2960000	2962000	What's up with that?
2962000	2963000	It's just men.
2963000	2966000	What I mean by that is I've seen pictures of my ancestry,
2966000	2968000	and all the men are identical.
2968000	2969000	And there's no women.
2969000	2970000	That's what I'm saying.
2970000	2972000	I'm putting it to you.
2972000	2974000	It's just me and a bunch of dudes with footballs
2974000	2977000	in the corner of Columbus and Stockton.
2977000	2981000	We've managed to breed homosexuals.
2982000	2984000	It was so funny when you guys were talking
2984000	2989000	about the guy who would be singing to another man
2989000	2991000	about his coxsmanship.
2991000	2993000	But guys stay away from that, don't they,
2993000	2995000	when they write a song?
2995000	2997000	They don't want to put too much on another man.
2997000	2999000	We're socialized to...
2999000	3002000	That's just defeat, right?
3002000	3005000	Like, if I go like this and you go like that,
3005000	3007000	then I get your Twizzlers.
3011000	3012000	But women aren't...
3012000	3013000	I mean, and I'm not...
3013000	3015000	So it's important to...
3015000	3017000	In these very sensitive times,
3017000	3019000	I'm talking about socialization.
3019000	3021000	I'm not talking about genetics.
3021000	3026000	So, like, girls are socialized at a young age.
3026000	3028000	They tend to be.
3029000	3031000	In a kind of superior way,
3031000	3033000	because it's like they're...
3033000	3035000	I think they're socialized to like...
3035000	3039000	They're not allowed to, you know,
3039000	3041000	to do this like flexing,
3041000	3044000	this weird like antler locking thing.
3044000	3047000	So they have to like...
3047000	3050000	They have more complex social structures.
3050000	3053000	And Jolene is a golden egg that comes out of that.
3053000	3056000	I was talking about the part before that that I liked.
3056000	3057000	What did you like?
3057000	3060000	The part that before you went off like that.
3061000	3063000	The part, yeah, the social thing.
3063000	3065000	It was just like when you were saying cock a lot.
3065000	3067000	That was the part I liked.
3067000	3069000	My problem with Jolene is I don't like it.
3069000	3071000	I think it's not a good song.
3071000	3073000	It goes on and on and on and on.
3073000	3075000	I like Dolly Parton a lot.
3075000	3077000	I saw her play at the Hollywood Bowl,
3077000	3079000	and it was awesome because...
3081000	3083000	Like half the people I could see sitting around me...
3083000	3085000	No, sorry, at the Greek Amphitheater in Los Angeles.
3085000	3088000	I looked around and I kind of got the feeling that
3088000	3092000	like 35-45% of the people around me were in drag.
3092000	3095000	Because she has a big like drag following.
3095000	3098000	Yeah, the real show at Dolly Parton shows is in the bathroom.
3098000	3099000	Is that right?
3099000	3100000	Yes.
3100000	3102000	It's a well-known fact, yeah.
3102000	3104000	Do you have any anecdotes you want to...
3104000	3105000	No, that's all I got.
3105000	3106000	I'm sorry for interrupting.
3106000	3108000	No, no, but the two guys, she was like...
3108000	3110000	She sang Jolene and she stopped about halfway through
3110000	3112000	and she said, I feel like I should change the lyrics to
3112000	3113000	drag queen, drag queen.
3113000	3115000	And half of the fucking crowd stood up
3115000	3118000	and they were like a bunch of six-foot-five men in dresses.
3118000	3119000	It was the best.
3119000	3121000	And also, her shows...
3121000	3123000	Anybody seen her live?
3123000	3124000	By applause.
3125000	3126000	Four.
3126000	3127000	Okay.
3127000	3128000	I heard one guy go, here you go.
3128000	3129000	Yep.
3132000	3134000	Are you in drag right now?
3134000	3135000	No.
3137000	3138000	Yep.
3138000	3141000	If she plays, please go see her because she's hilarious.
3141000	3143000	Like she's funny as hell.
3143000	3146000	Also, I cried multiple times.
3146000	3148000	She's an incredible storyteller.
3148000	3151000	During her songs, in between songs.
3151000	3152000	She's like...
3152000	3153000	Nobody puts on a show like her.
3153000	3154000	She's really, really good.
3154000	3157000	And she plays every fucking instrument in the building.
3157000	3161000	She plays a saxophone at one point, grand piano, banjo, mandolin.
3161000	3163000	She's all over the shop and she's great.
3163000	3165000	But Jolene's too long.
3165000	3166000	Jolene, no.
3168000	3169000	For me, it's repetitive.
3169000	3170000	It's modal.
3171000	3172000	It doesn't like...
3173000	3174000	I mean, maybe it does.
3174000	3176000	I haven't heard it in a while.
3176000	3179000	Because when I hear it, if I listen to satellite radio and I hear it,
3179000	3183000	I listen to a couple of verses of it because there's 35 verses in it.
3183000	3185000	I don't know that it goes to a bridge.
3185000	3187000	It just kind of stays in the same thing.
3187000	3188000	Yeah, I guess you're right.
3188000	3190000	I don't think Jolene does have a bridge, does it?
3190000	3191000	Yeah.
3191000	3192000	The bridge would be what?
3192000	3193000	I don't know what you would say.
3193000	3194000	It just kind of...
3194000	3195000	It's one of those songs.
3195000	3198000	All the times you want to fuck a man you always get to.
3198000	3201000	But I'm just asking for you to not fuck this one.
3204000	3207000	That's already the verses I think would have to go to another place.
3207000	3209000	Her backstory would have to go to another place.
3209000	3210000	I was just thinking melodically.
3210000	3213000	Yeah, melodically, that's a sweet bridge again.
3214000	3215000	Thank you.
3215000	3218000	It always tripped me up because it's Jolene.
3218000	3221000	You know, I always thought of myself dressed as a lady,
3221000	3225000	going into town, experimenting, et cetera.
3225000	3227000	Like you would use the word Jolene.
3227000	3228000	Yeah.
3228000	3232000	Like when I'm on the phone, I'd insist you call me Jolene.
3232000	3233000	Jolene.
3233000	3235000	That's a good name for a...
3235000	3236000	Yeah, like a butch.
3236000	3237000	For an alias.
3237000	3241000	Like if I disappeared into the city tonight after this show,
3241000	3245000	in like a pantsuit, I'd be Jolene.
3245000	3246000	Right.
3246000	3252000	All of the registered books and all the motels would be Jolene.
3252000	3255000	And then I'd put my lips like on it.
3255000	3256000	Like with lipstick.
3258000	3260000	So, so, so...
3261000	3265000	Joel, where are you situated now when you're not in San Francisco?
3265000	3266000	I live in Pennsylvania now.
3266000	3267000	Pennsylvania?
3267000	3268000	Yeah.
3268000	3269000	So are you...
3269000	3271000	And where's your brother?
3271000	3272000	He's in LA.
3272000	3273000	Oh, okay.
3273000	3274000	Yeah.
3274000	3275000	Well, fuck that guy.
3275000	3276000	Yeah.
3276000	3277000	He's awesome.
3277000	3278000	Obviously, you thought that too.
3278000	3279000	You're like, fuck it.
3279000	3280000	No.
3280000	3281000	I still love him.
3281000	3282000	Come on.
3282000	3285000	We're still like close, aren't we?
3285000	3286000	How many kids do you have now?
3286000	3287000	Two.
3287000	3288000	Two.
3288000	3293000	And you know what I'm talking about.
3293000	3294000	Yeah.
3294000	3295000	He likes two kids.
3295000	3296000	Jolene.
3296000	3298000	Jolene's a big fan of two kids.
3298000	3302000	I can only sire children dressed as Jolene.
3302000	3305000	And what are you focusing on creatively?
3305000	3307000	Well, I just did...
3307000	3310000	We just did six years in a cinematic Titanic,
3310000	3313000	which was like the original cast from Mystery Science Theater.
3313000	3316000	We did a ton of shows, and we just stopped that.
3316000	3319000	So it's kind of like...
3319000	3320000	And then I'm doing my one-man show.
3320000	3321000	So that's kind of it.
3321000	3322000	What's your one-man show?
3322000	3323000	I don't know anything about this.
3323000	3326000	It's called Riffing Myself a New One.
3326000	3327000	And it's just about...
3327000	3330000	It's like about the DNA of Mystery Science Theater.
3330000	3332000	So it's just this origin story.
3332000	3334000	Do you go out and do you do it in present tense
3334000	3337000	and kind of go through the times and go like...
3337000	3340000	So, Fort Atkinson...
3340000	3342000	Wait, are you doing me, man?
3342000	3343000	Wait a second.
3343000	3344000	He does an impression of you.
3344000	3345000	I don't talk like that.
3345000	3346000	Come on, man.
3346000	3350000	You've got a lot of nerve coming at me with that stupid voice.
3350000	3353000	I'm not going to do your podcast anymore, man.
3353000	3357000	If you keep on fucking doing an impression of me...
3358000	3363000	Is it bad to tell the line about the problem with modern pornography,
3363000	3366000	when you do an impression of him about his problem with porn?
3366000	3368000	Wasn't that you doing an impression of him?
3368000	3369000	What? No.
3369000	3372000	About his mythological Joseph Campbellian story arc?
3372000	3373000	Oh, wasn't it?
3373000	3374000	Well, yeah, it was you.
3374000	3375000	That was you.
3375000	3377000	I say this all the time, too.
3377000	3379000	It's like, problem with porn, man.
3379000	3381000	Now, it's all about...
3381000	3385000	It's like we've lost the refusal of the call, man.
3385000	3387000	It's like...
3387000	3390000	It used to be, you know, a guy go into a library
3390000	3393000	and it's like, you know, my book's overdue,
3393000	3396000	but like, okay, I can't do that, man.
3396000	3398000	But I guess I have to.
3398000	3400000	That's the key, man.
3400000	3404000	I'd love to, like, get in on this, but I don't do me.
3405000	3407000	Oh, own it, Joe.
3409000	3412000	So, yeah, so your one-man show...
3412000	3413000	So I do that.
3413000	3415000	So did I ever get to finish my plug? I didn't.
3415000	3418000	No, no, I did the bit where...
3418000	3420000	Tomorrow night, good seats still available.
3420000	3421000	Come on.
3421000	3424000	Won't you? Thank you.
3424000	3425000	I'm done.
3425000	3427000	Are you going to leave or you're not going to stay in place?
3427000	3429000	No, I'll stay as long.
3429000	3431000	I have a feeling I'm going to get tired
3431000	3433000	and then you'll see me go.
3433000	3435000	But I'll stay as long as I can.
3435000	3437000	As long as I use some of this.
3437000	3438000	Yeah, yeah, man.
3438000	3439000	That'll pep you up.
3439000	3441000	Yeah, it's a bracelet.
3441000	3445000	Nothing says good morning like a big glass of kettle one vodka.
3448000	3449000	So you're...
3449000	3451000	I don't want to derail you, though.
3451000	3452000	I feel like I'm...
3452000	3453000	No, no, no.
3453000	3454000	Our show has no rail?
3454000	3455000	Yeah.
3456000	3460000	I'm a bad interviewer and a bad friend and a bad person
3460000	3464000	and a bad podcaster and a bad thing to pay $20 to see
3464000	3470000	and a bad carbon-based life form and a bad go on.
3471000	3477000	However, if I could ring anything out of you while I had you here,
3477000	3479000	it would be sort of like...
3479000	3483000	I like to hear you talk about creative philosophy
3483000	3487000	because when I moved to LA, I was lost in this sea of like...
3487000	3489000	It's really easy to...
3489000	3494000	It's like a cult because you come from the Midwest into LA
3494000	3499000	and everyone's saying stuff that if they're all saying it, then it's true.
3499000	3502000	I remember just sitting and having drinks or dinner with you
3502000	3503000	or you were...
3503000	3504000	I don't know.
3504000	3507000	You would say stuff to me that kind of like guided me.
3507000	3508000	I don't know.
3508000	3509000	Maybe it was just a cultural thing.
3509000	3511000	Like you sounded like a guy from the Midwest
3511000	3513000	and you were out here and you had been through the ropes.
3513000	3516000	Like you would tell these stories about how when you were...
3516000	3521000	Like back before night court, you had the same agent as Harry Anderson
3521000	3524000	and there was a point where you were like...
3524000	3525000	I remember...
3525000	3529000	You were like this prop comic that was on SNL killing it,
3529000	3531000	like had these inventions that you would show
3531000	3534000	and there were of course people that were going like,
3534000	3535000	Hey, fucking...
3535000	3538000	Like Joel Hodgson, he's the hottest thing.
3538000	3540000	We got to get you on a sitcom and stuff
3540000	3542000	and you kind of like...
3542000	3545000	You diverted from that path because you smelled a rat.
3545000	3548000	Like you figured that probably wouldn't be a great idea.
3548000	3551000	I remember talking to you about that stuff and kind of like
3551000	3554000	having that as a guidepost and realizing that it was okay
3554000	3557000	in this sea of people kissing your ass
3557000	3560000	and telling you everything that you thought you wanted to hear
3560000	3562000	that you still had to maintain your own sanity.
3562000	3566000	I have no idea what to ask you to wring some of that out of you, but...
3566000	3569000	Well, shit.
3570000	3571000	What do you think about black people?
3571000	3572000	That story in particular...
3572000	3573000	What's that?
3573000	3574000	What do you think?
3574000	3577000	I was just going to say that story in particular was
3577000	3580000	Brandon Tartikoff, who was the head of NBC,
3580000	3582000	he wanted me to do a show called High School USA,
3582000	3587000	which was this Michael J. Fox, kind of like Animal House.
3587000	3589000	They did a movie of that, right?
3589000	3590000	Yeah, this is a long time ago.
3590000	3591000	This is like...
3591000	3592000	I was 22.
3592000	3593000	It was like 30 years ago.
3593000	3595000	So it was like he said,
3595000	3597000	Yeah, we want you to do this show.
3598000	3602000	And I read the script and I just didn't think it was funny
3602000	3604000	and I didn't think I could make it work.
3604000	3607000	And it just seemed kind of stupid.
3607000	3609000	And I said no to it.
3609000	3612000	And they just doubled the money.
3612000	3614000	They just said, Oh, yeah, okay.
3614000	3620000	I think they were giving me 10 grand a show with six guaranteed.
3620000	3621000	And they doubled it.
3621000	3624000	So it had been over $100,000 30 years ago.
3624000	3626000	And they just said, Okay, you don't want to do it.
3626000	3628000	Here's twice the money.
3628000	3630000	And it just made me...
3630000	3631000	It didn't make me feel better.
3631000	3634000	It made me feel worse because I realized that my opinion
3634000	3638000	didn't really mean anything in the face of all that money.
3638000	3639000	You know what I mean?
3639000	3641000	They could change your opinion.
3641000	3643000	And that's when I quit and went back to Minneapolis
3643000	3645000	and then like six or eight months later
3645000	3646000	started Mystery Science Theater.
3646000	3649000	So it was the right thing to do for me.
3649000	3651000	But yeah, I think that's what you meant.
3651000	3654000	That's why this sea of people...
3654000	3657000	You made your mark not from Los Angeles
3657000	3660000	and not with the help of these suits that were throwing piles of money at you
3660000	3662000	even though there was an option for you.
3662000	3666000	It's always the right thing to do to follow your own compass
3666000	3670000	and if you want to create, then you have to actually create.
3670000	3674000	There are a lot of people that really want to make a lot of money
3674000	3678000	and can kind of create and they're happy to...
3681000	3683000	You have to be willing to be homeless.
3683000	3686000	You have to be willing to kill yourself.
3689000	3690000	So that there's no choice.
3690000	3692000	If it's entertaining, you mean.
3692000	3694000	You can kill yourself if you do it.
3694000	3695000	Yeah.
3698000	3700000	I find young people asking that question all the time.
3700000	3702000	Like, well, what should I do in this case?
3702000	3704000	How do you know when you should do this and that?
3704000	3705000	And it's like...
3705000	3707000	Well, you have to be...
3707000	3711000	You have to know that if you tried to wash dishes,
3711000	3712000	you'd just be worse at that.
3712000	3715000	You'd have to be willing to sit under a bridge
3715000	3721000	and just die of exposure if nobody gave you money
3721000	3725000	and still, as your frozen grin sealed shut
3725000	3728000	and your eyes glazed over,
3728000	3730000	the last thought you'd have is like,
3730000	3733000	still though, I did what I wanted.
3733000	3736000	And if you really wouldn't feel that way as you died,
3736000	3738000	then don't...
3738000	3739000	Well, be a hack.
3739000	3741000	Try to figure out how to make money.
3741000	3745000	And as that character in Citizen Kane says,
3745000	3747000	to paraphrase him, like, making money is no trick
3747000	3748000	if that's all you want to do.
3748000	3749000	Just go do it.
3749000	3750000	Go make money.
3750000	3751000	It's a lot of interesting...
3751000	3753000	But I don't know.
3753000	3756000	Who was that guy that you guys, like, kind of...
3756000	3759000	Like, he kind of had this style of...
3759000	3761000	Like, I can't remember what you guys...
3761000	3763000	Remember that roast you guys did?
3763000	3767000	And there was a guy there who had this kind of training
3767000	3768000	where he'd take you to the airport.
3768000	3770000	Oh, yeah, Sam Christensen, yeah.
3770000	3772000	What was his name? Did you do that too?
3772000	3773000	Sam Christensen, yeah.
3773000	3774000	Yeah, Jeff did that.
3774000	3775000	That seemed, like, fascinating.
3775000	3776000	Like, what was that?
3776000	3778000	Like, what was his deal?
3778000	3780000	This guy, his name is Sam Christensen,
3780000	3781000	and he's this teacher.
3781000	3784000	And it sounds like overly guru-y to talk about him
3784000	3788000	because we talk about him pretty high-flowing tones.
3788000	3790000	A lot of people have been to him,
3790000	3792000	whether they're actors or not.
3792000	3794000	You go in and you find out...
3794000	3796000	It's changed a lot since I went.
3796000	3799000	But he's got this kind of pretty streamlined way
3799000	3802000	of you figuring out the essential qualities
3802000	3805000	that you've always had, and you always will have.
3805000	3808000	There's compliments you've been paid your whole life
3808000	3810000	and insults that you've received your whole life,
3810000	3812000	and you will get them for the rest of your life.
3812000	3813000	If people like you...
3813000	3815000	Like, if people like me, they might call me poised or confident.
3815000	3817000	If they don't like me, they'll call me arrogant
3817000	3818000	or conceited or whatever.
3818000	3820000	But they're talking about a certain neighborhood
3820000	3822000	of an essential quality.
3822000	3824000	And you go in there, and it's very, very interesting
3824000	3826000	to find out the stuff that you wish people didn't see,
3826000	3828000	but they all do.
3828000	3831000	And the stuff that you wish people didn't see,
3831000	3832000	but they all do...
3832000	3834000	In fact, I didn't get that right opposite-wise.
3834000	3837000	The stuff that we wish we had that we don't.
3837000	3840000	And the stuff that we have that we wish we didn't have.
3840000	3843000	We used to go to the airport a long time ago before.
3843000	3846000	You could be at the gate without a boarding pass.
3846000	3847000	That's how long ago that was.
3847000	3849000	And you would ask a stranger to look at somebody else
3849000	3853000	and check off adjectives for use, Joel standing over there.
3853000	3854000	And it's fucking fascinating.
3854000	3856000	If you gave it to five people or 500 people,
3856000	3859000	they would all pick the exact same words to describe you.
3859000	3860000	And it's really chilling.
3860000	3861000	The same grouping.
3861000	3864000	It's like, I put on a blue sweater.
3864000	3865000	I comb my hair.
3865000	3866000	I put on a bow tie.
3866000	3868000	Like, you go back multiple times,
3868000	3873000	but people who never heard me say a word know that I'm sarcastic.
3873000	3874000	People from Germany.
3874000	3876000	People from fucking Italy.
3876000	3877000	They're sitting in LAX.
3877000	3880000	They circle the word sarcastic for me.
3880000	3885000	It's been the result of the cause of a lot of problems in my life.
3885000	3887000	People assume I'm being sarcastic.
3887000	3891000	People for me always checked off shit sprinkles.
3891000	3892000	Sparkles.
3892000	3893000	Glitter.
3893000	3894000	I fucked it.
3894000	3895000	God damn it.
3895000	3897000	Glitter shit is what I meant.
3897000	3900000	He's a glitter shitter from way back.
3900000	3901000	Glitter, glitter.
3901000	3903000	Have you been to glitter shitter?
3903000	3905000	That's where the after parties are after.
3905000	3906000	Yeah, you know.
3906000	3908000	Here's what I'd like to do.
3909000	3912000	I'd like to bring out Erin McGathey, my betrothed.
3919000	3920000	Owning it.
3927000	3928000	Thank you.
3928000	3929000	Here's Scoops.
3929000	3930000	You want to...
3930000	3931000	Oh, yeah.
3931000	3932000	I stole this here.
3932000	3933000	Oh.
3934000	3936000	It's hard to tell what's going on, but...
3936000	3937000	Scoops.
3937000	3938000	Scoops.
3938000	3939000	Scoops.
3939000	3941000	Scoops with a P or scoops with a B?
3941000	3944000	Well, I mean, sometimes scoops, but I...
3944000	3945000	Scoops.
3945000	3946000	Doesn't matter.
3946000	3947000	It's private.
3948000	3949000	Hello, Erin.
3949000	3950000	How are you?
3950000	3951000	I'm doing great.
3951000	3952000	I'm owning it.
3954000	3957000	We're owning it and we're apologizing.
3957000	3962000	I'm sorry that I ate two quarter pounders without telling you.
3962000	3963000	Oh, it's okay.
3963000	3964000	I'm sorry.
3964000	3968000	I may have had some hummus with pita yesterday.
3969000	3972000	Wait, it sounds like your diet's a little stricter than Dan's.
3973000	3974000	It's still cheating.
3974000	3976000	I didn't realize how big this space was.
3976000	3977000	My heart's aflutter.
3977000	3981000	I thought it was just this first area and now I'm in the coliseum.
3981000	3985000	Also, there's a weird sort of legion of doom people that kind of...
3986000	3988000	That lighting's unfortunate.
3988000	3989000	It looks like...
3989000	3990000	Very eerily lit sort of...
3990000	3993000	It looks like you're all going to go like this.
3993000	3996000	You stand convicted of intergalactic smuggling.
3997000	3999000	It looks like you're all about to go kill Superman.
4000000	4003000	Did you guys do something right to get this heat or something terribly wrong?
4003000	4004000	It's really good.
4007000	4010000	And the thing that's cool is they're lit for our pleasure.
4010000	4011000	Yeah.
4011000	4013000	There's no real practical reason they're lit up there.
4013000	4014000	That's for us.
4014000	4017000	Yeah, they're top lit, so they all look like somebody from like...
4017000	4018000	Zardoz or something.
4018000	4022000	Somebody up there yelled out something incredibly distinct that I couldn't understand.
4022000	4023000	What was that?
4023000	4024000	Who's the guy that did the sci-fi?
4026000	4027000	Oh, Zardoz.
4027000	4028000	Now we're getting actual Zardoz quotes.
4028000	4029000	Zardoz quotes.
4029000	4030000	All right, awesome.
4031000	4032000	Can we...
4032000	4036000	Dustin, can you run up and mic everybody up there so they can just weigh in?
4038000	4042000	All right, so now that we have this triumvirate...
4042000	4045000	While we're in San Francisco because we're just passing through,
4045000	4050000	I do want, before we move on,
4050000	4052000	I want to help one person from San Francisco.
4052000	4054000	You don't have to be from San Francisco.
4054000	4057000	You could be from Mississippi.
4057000	4059000	You could be from...
4059000	4062000	Three hours later, you could be from Pacoima.
4062000	4065000	And you could be from Kansas.
4067000	4073000	Is there anybody who really feels even more so than they just want to be on stage,
4073000	4076000	and wanting to be on stage is fine,
4076000	4079000	but somebody who really feels like they're in a...
4079000	4081000	Like they got a problem.
4081000	4083000	They got some pain.
4083000	4085000	But remember, suffering's relative.
4086000	4088000	That we could help you with.
4091000	4094000	Okay, well, I mean, I can only hear you in the back.
4094000	4096000	I can't see you, so...
4096000	4099000	Is somebody walking toward the stage, or is that a cocktail person?
4099000	4102000	I heard somebody say my girlfriend broke up with me.
4102000	4104000	Get up here, sir.
4105000	4107000	I think that's easy pain to access.
4107000	4109000	Would you be willing to come up here?
4109000	4111000	Person that said that?
4111000	4113000	No?
4113000	4115000	Oh, he's coming?
4115000	4118000	Is he coming from the senatorial overlords up top?
4122000	4124000	Here he comes.
4124000	4126000	It's funny to have to do a mad dash down for the...
4126000	4128000	My girlfriend broke up with me!
4130000	4132000	Listen, it's the Price is Right.
4135000	4137000	Hello. What's your name, sir?
4137000	4138000	Why are so many...
4138000	4140000	Jeremy. It's Jeremy, everybody.
4140000	4142000	Motherfucker, would you shake my hand?
4144000	4147000	I held my hand out, and he walked past me like a piece of shit.
4149000	4151000	Would you want Jeremy to sit here?
4151000	4153000	I have no idea how I walked through that piece of shit.
4153000	4155000	Do you want him to sit here?
4155000	4156000	Yeah, yeah.
4156000	4159000	No, no, no. We'll sit Jeremy at the table there.
4159000	4160000	That's fine.
4160000	4161000	Alright.
4161000	4163000	I do think Jeremy's safest next to me.
4163000	4168000	Okay, Jeremy, you have some of the finest minds in the world up here.
4168000	4173000	You're feeling pain. Tell us about it.
4173000	4175000	Give us the headlines.
4175000	4181000	We were together for two and a half years, and she dumped me.
4181000	4184000	And, yeah.
4184000	4188000	How did she do it? In prison, over the phone, via text, email?
4188000	4190000	It was very sudden.
4190000	4192000	What did she say?
4192000	4194000	I have a question, Jeremy. How did she do it?
4194000	4201000	It was in person, and, you know, she gave a lot of reasons,
4201000	4205000	but, you know, the deep reason was we had communication problems.
4205000	4210000	For the listener, Jeremy is closing his eyes and gesturing with his...
4210000	4211000	That's what I do, too.
4211000	4214000	And he's turned away from us. I don't know why.
4214000	4216000	What about your communication?
4216000	4219000	What was this line that she made up about communication?
4219000	4223000	Grab the mic and just kind of eat it so that you're free to...
4223000	4225000	You can communicate however you want.
4225000	4228000	Or also eat it, so everyone would probably like to see you try it.
4228000	4233000	We very much loved each other, but we did not communicate.
4233000	4238000	And she was someone who did not talk, and I was someone who would not listen.
4238000	4242000	And so there was a communication that just did not happen,
4242000	4247000	even though we were both good people who loved each other very much.
4247000	4249000	Jeremy, you're a very handsome man.
4249000	4252000	Do you know that you turn into Ray Charles when you're talking about your feelings?
4252000	4258000	I got a woman! I helped him! She's good to me!
4258000	4265000	Did you know that you turn into Hank Williams II when someone says you're like Ray Charles?
4265000	4268000	You have awakened all kinds of things.
4268000	4272000	Are you ready for some football? Are you ready?
4272000	4274000	I'm actually not ready for football.
4274000	4279000	Jeremy, how are you feeling about it now? Where are you at?
4279000	4284000	It's been a couple of weeks, and my friends have really been there for me,
4284000	4289000	and I'm feeling okay. My friends have been really good to me, and so I feel okay.
4289000	4294000	Why are people calling out lying?
4294000	4298000	Okay, there's a part of me that does not feel okay, but the rest of me feels great.
4299000	4304000	She's right there. Come on up. Come on up. It's her. She's in the audience.
4304000	4307000	We're going to bring him together right now.
4307000	4310000	This is his platonic friend.
4310000	4313000	A woman just yelled out, he comes to my work all the time.
4313000	4315000	Get up here. Get up here.
4315000	4317000	Annie Hall, everybody.
4317000	4319000	I'm ready for some football.
4319000	4322000	And if we don't have a mic, we're finding enough mics until we can all get on stage.
4322000	4324000	Share with me. What's your name?
4324000	4325000	I'm Eva.
4325000	4327000	Eva, you have a rebuttal?
4327000	4331000	I work at Boogaloo's, and this guy comes in all the time.
4331000	4333000	I've never seen him with a girlfriend once.
4333000	4336000	I worked there for two years.
4336000	4338000	Sam Francisco!
4338000	4341000	She ordered the same thing every time.
4341000	4343000	Does Boogaloo sell cruelty?
4343000	4346000	Yeah, God doesn't have to be with a girl to have a girlfriend.
4346000	4350000	I'm just saying, this guy, he's awesome,
4350000	4355000	but I don't believe he was in a long-term, two-and-a-half relationship.
4356000	4358000	What in the world?
4358000	4362000	This isn't helping the healing process.
4362000	4364000	All right, Jeremy.
4364000	4367000	There's a chamber of commerce.
4367000	4373000	Jeremy, why do you think she would say that she doesn't believe that you were in a two-year relationship?
4373000	4375000	Was this maybe a little one-sided?
4375000	4377000	She would not believe what? I'm sorry.
4377000	4379000	Say that again.
4379000	4382000	Eva here doesn't believe you that you had a long-term girlfriend.
4382000	4387000	So first off, let the record state, and you can back me up on this, I tip well.
4387000	4391000	I'm a good tipper. I'm not a deadbeat. I'm not an asshole.
4391000	4393000	No, you are a great guy.
4393000	4395000	I'm a good tipper.
4395000	4403000	I was just wondering, because I know that I've been in a relationship for well over two years going to New Orleans.
4403000	4406000	Liar!
4406000	4408000	I knew that was coming.
4408000	4411000	I am with the man today.
4411000	4415000	No, I was just...
4415000	4418000	Okay, now, Eva.
4418000	4420000	Let's get these two together.
4420000	4421000	Stay for a moment.
4421000	4426000	Jeremy, she's accusing and so are more than one other people out in the audience.
4426000	4428000	There was another female voice.
4428000	4430000	There's at least one other.
4430000	4434000	It almost feels like there's a consortium of local business owners that...
4434000	4437000	The chamber of commerce hates me!
4438000	4441000	Definitely a counterproductive...
4441000	4442000	Okay, wait, here's the thing.
4442000	4448000	She said quite succinctly that she does not believe that you had a long-term relationship,
4448000	4451000	and you did not leap to your defense that quickly.
4451000	4456000	You said you were a good tipper, which seems like an odd rebuttal to that accusation.
4456000	4457000	I am a good tipper.
4457000	4459000	Money talks, baby cakes!
4459000	4464000	There's real pain out there, and a fake relationship is not one of...
4468000	4470000	This is the best.
4470000	4474000	So, world's best harm in town!
4474000	4476000	It ain't bad.
4476000	4477000	Wow.
4477000	4479000	Just to be...
4479000	4482000	Joel, this show might go three hours.
4482000	4483000	Allow me...
4483000	4488000	So, the thing is that I actually live like half a block from Boogaloo's,
4488000	4493000	so once a week I have my work from home day, and I usually go there...
4493000	4495000	As we all do.
4496000	4500000	So, it is possible that half the time I have been there was without my girlfriend.
4500000	4504000	So, if she was an ex-girlfriend, she is not my girlfriend.
4504000	4506000	She is a free woman now.
4506000	4507000	I want to...
4507000	4509000	Can we put the focus back on Eva?
4509000	4511000	Also, why would I lie about this?
4511000	4513000	Let's take a second and think about this.
4513000	4515000	Why would I lie about this?
4515000	4516000	Jeremy, I...
4516000	4518000	I wish I was lying about this.
4518000	4519000	That's an incredibly...
4519000	4521000	I wish that she did not ever...
4521000	4522000	That's not helping.
4522000	4524000	No, that's not helping.
4524000	4525000	That's not true.
4525000	4526000	That's not true.
4526000	4527000	That's about to kick your side.
4527000	4528000	That's not helping.
4528000	4529000	That's not true.
4529000	4530000	Eva.
4530000	4531000	Eva.
4531000	4532000	I...
4532000	4533000	I'm glad she existed.
4533000	4534000	Eva, may I ask you?
4534000	4536000	I'm glad that she was with me, and I'm glad that we had our...
4536000	4538000	Eva, Jeremy, you're hanging yourself.
4538000	4540000	Eva, why...
4540000	4545000	When you were in the audience and you felt motivated to yell out that it wasn't real,
4545000	4548000	what part of you is angry about him claiming that he had a relationship?
4548000	4550000	Like, what is that...
4550000	4552000	What does that extend from?
4552000	4554000	Is that a San Francisco thing?
4554000	4557000	Do you need a special certificate, or is there a...
4557000	4559000	Yeah, give her the mic, Eva.
4559000	4561000	Well, I wasn't trying...
4561000	4565000	I never assumed you never had a girlfriend, because you came in...
4565000	4571000	I go to restaurants probably every other day by myself, and I...
4571000	4572000	And I have to...
4572000	4573000	And I have to...
4573000	4574000	Yeah, I'm like, I have a boyfriend.
4574000	4578000	He just works at night, you know, like...
4578000	4584000	But just you could tell by his voice...
4584000	4586000	I'm sorry.
4586000	4593000	I could just tell, and most people that do have relationships and that have been hurt,
4593000	4597000	you can just hear it in their voice that, yeah, no, I really love somebody.
4597000	4600000	But this is the thing that I'm curious about, because the big question is,
4600000	4603000	as he points out, which I think is a valid rhetorical question,
4603000	4604000	why would he lie?
4604000	4606000	But I'm even more intrigued.
4606000	4607000	Why are you...
4607000	4608000	Why were you...
4608000	4612000	Without accusing any of you of anything, why were you compelled?
4612000	4614000	That's what Aaron's asking, because you...
4614000	4617000	Does he come in and, like, ply this?
4617000	4618000	No, no, no, no.
4618000	4622000	Because I just made one snide, rude comment to my boyfriend,
4622000	4624000	like, I've never seen him with a girlfriend.
4624000	4626000	And he's like, you should say it.
4626000	4628000	And I was like...
4628000	4631000	If you had to guess, what do you think his...
4631000	4633000	If you had to guess why he would make up a...
4633000	4640000	So here's the thing, Maggie, the non-Google-able version of her name,
4640000	4646000	Maggie, you should email either Dan or Aaron and tell them that you exist.
4646000	4650000	You're probably not going to be happy that I'm talking about you right now.
4650000	4655000	But you listened to this, and you should prove her wrong.
4655000	4656000	Oh, Jeremy.
4656000	4657000	Jeremy, Jeremy.
4657000	4659000	Actually, I don't even think she...
4660000	4661000	It's okay, Jeremy.
4661000	4662000	Eva, what...
4662000	4663000	If you...
4663000	4664000	My boyfriend...
4664000	4665000	My boyfriend over there that told me...
4665000	4666000	She's my girlfriend again!
4666000	4667000	She loves me!
4667000	4668000	She loves me!
4668000	4669000	Hold up, hold up, hold up.
4669000	4670000	We may love at summer camp!
4670000	4671000	Order, order.
4671000	4675000	Okay, Eva, you came up here simply because your boyfriend fucking goaded you to come up here?
4675000	4679000	Your boyfriend, who we've never seen...
4679000	4681000	He's like...
4681000	4682000	Wait, god damn it.
4682000	4683000	They'll love it.
4683000	4686000	You have been coming on this stage for minutes and minutes,
4686000	4688000	and I have never, ever seen this boyfriend.
4688000	4691000	There is a boyfriend out there.
4691000	4692000	Maybe two.
4692000	4694000	Nobody cares about that part of it.
4694000	4699000	We care about the fact that you actually have no convictions about whether he had a girlfriend or not.
4699000	4700000	No, no, no, she did.
4700000	4703000	She had a leisurely one, and her boyfriend was like...
4703000	4705000	A casual work.
4705000	4711000	Eva, what do you think if you had to guess, what do you think his motivation would be for making up a girlfriend?
4711000	4713000	When you were...
4714000	4716000	I have that anyway.
4717000	4718000	Eva!
4719000	4721000	Come on now.
4722000	4732000	I'm sitting in the background, and I've heard a familiar voice coming from the balcony, so I was...
4735000	4739000	I should have never called out anybody that feels like they may have been in love.
4739000	4742000	But you still feel that he did not have a girlfriend for two and a half years.
4742000	4743000	I still don't.
4743000	4744000	You stand by that.
4744000	4745000	I stand by that, yeah.
4746000	4748000	That would be so much easier.
4748000	4749000	Hang on, hang on, hang on.
4749000	4751000	My show of applause right now.
4751000	4752000	My show of applause...
4753000	4755000	First of all, let's do this a couple of ways.
4755000	4760000	First off, and I want this to be honest, no ironic bullshit here.
4760000	4765000	People that already know Jeremy, or have met him before and don't run town, please applaud right now.
4767000	4769000	Okay, three or four or five people.
4769000	4770000	Come on!
4770000	4772000	All right, now, everybody...
4772000	4773000	You met her!
4774000	4775000	Everybody else.
4775000	4776000	Everybody else in here.
4776000	4781000	Who believes Jeremy that he's heartbroken over his breakup of two and a half years?
4783000	4784000	Wow.
4784000	4786000	I feel like we've stumbled on a very complicated...
4786000	4790000	Who thinks that there might be some malarkey going on with that?
4792000	4793000	Wow.
4794000	4795000	And Jeremy.
4795000	4796000	Jeremy.
4796000	4798000	Hold on, hey, all right, thank you, thank you, thank you.
4799000	4800000	You were right!
4800000	4802000	Jeremy, hang on.
4802000	4803000	I'm not editorializing on that.
4803000	4807000	I just wanted to see what the audience felt based on human interaction so far.
4807000	4808000	That was clear enough.
4808000	4812000	I mean, they're going to follow the drama, and I'm not saying they're wrong to do it, but it's like...
4812000	4815000	But people smelled it before she did.
4815000	4817000	There was already a feeling of that.
4817000	4818000	I don't know.
4818000	4820000	Well, I don't know about that.
4820000	4821000	I know that...
4821000	4826000	Like, if somebody comes up and starts saying, like, I love french fries, I love french fries all the time.
4826000	4830000	My favorite kind of french fries, and then someone goes like, that's what you want us to think.
4831000	4833000	I'm going to go like, what the fuck?
4834000	4843000	And then if that person comes up with a hat and a sweater, and it's like, ladies and gentlemen, this man pretends to like french fries.
4845000	4846000	And I'm not saying you're...
4846000	4850000	We're not leaving it until we know the fucking truth about this.
4850000	4851000	I'm just saying that.
4851000	4852000	Lock the door is closed.
4852000	4853000	Can we just point out?
4853000	4854000	I'm not saying you're a charlatan.
4855000	4862000	I'm just saying that as an audience member, narratively, your mind then goes to...
4862000	4864000	We've all seen Errol Morris documentaries.
4864000	4865000	Like, you're fucking...
4865000	4870000	Like, the first time bullshit is called, you're on the side of the...
4870000	4871000	Like, you fucking yo-yo.
4871000	4872000	I don't know what the fuck to think.
4872000	4874000	What the fuck is going on?
4874000	4876000	Let us just...
4876000	4881000	If you were in love, and you just got your heart broken, you would have more details than,
4881000	4884000	she didn't listen, I couldn't listen.
4884000	4885000	I don't want more details.
4885000	4887000	Can we just point out for a moment?
4887000	4890000	The thing is, you don't actually want more details.
4890000	4893000	I could give you more details, but no one here wants to hear them.
4893000	4894000	San Francisco! San Francisco!
4894000	4896000	To the tail lightning round!
4896000	4898000	To the tail lightning round!
4901000	4909000	Can we just point out for a moment, as somebody, and I'm sure I share the stage with other people who feel the same way,
4909000	4915000	as somebody who spent a lot of her time heartbroken, it sounds like, in San Francisco, it's a real privilege.
4917000	4918000	I mean, is this my...
4918000	4919000	Do you have a special...
4919000	4920000	This is my bahala.
4920000	4921000	I'm queen here.
4921000	4923000	I'm like, oh, so many breakups.
4923000	4924000	But, yeah, I guess a detail lightning round.
4924000	4927000	There's a special punch card for free coffee, if you...
4927000	4928000	All right.
4928000	4929000	Detail lightning round.
4929000	4933000	Okay, so somebody that's better at asking questions than me...
4933000	4938000	I think it would be great if we start out by just saying four super-cute things that she used to do
4938000	4939000	that he loved.
4939000	4940000	Okay.
4940000	4942000	Just really adorable things.
4942000	4944000	And you have to keep your eyes open while you explain.
4944000	4948000	Okay, so she was mildly narcoleptic, and so...
4948000	4949000	That's awesome.
4949000	4954000	She would fall asleep if left unattended.
4954000	4962000	And it was a little annoying because she always had to take naps, so it was kind of cute, because we'd always take naps together.
4962000	4964000	So that's one thing.
4965000	4966000	Let's see.
4966000	4971000	We would refer to ourselves as mammals and just talk about how great it was to be mammals.
4971000	4972000	Okay, now we're drifting.
4972000	4973000	We're drifting.
4973000	4974000	No, two more.
4974000	4975000	Two more.
4975000	4976000	I mean, lightning round.
4976000	4977000	Two more.
4977000	4978000	Two more.
4978000	4979000	Two more.
4979000	4980000	That's pretty cute.
4980000	4981000	All right, okay.
4981000	4982000	Let's see.
4982000	4984000	So when she would say the word cashew, it was really cute.
4984000	4986000	She'd be like, cashew!
4986000	4987000	I don't know.
4987000	4988000	It's feeling real to me.
4988000	4989000	I like that.
4989000	4990000	Is it?
4990000	4993000	We had this Asian chicken salad that we would make there.
4993000	4996000	Cashews in it.
4996000	4999000	Last one.
4999000	5000000	Lightning round, Jeremy.
5000000	5007000	Sometimes after we'd make out, we would just kind of look at each other and smile and know that we were making each other happy and not have to say anything.
5007000	5008000	Oh, man.
5008000	5010000	It sounds like you just watched a Justin Long movie.
5010000	5011000	I'm sorry.
5011000	5012000	My moment isn't cool enough for real.
5012000	5014000	Either she's real or he's a cuteness genius.
5014000	5015000	Okay, okay, fine.
5015000	5017000	This is a real nuance of bullying.
5017000	5032000	I will tell you the best moment of our relationship, and it was when we got to go to this random event for my company, this random charitable event, and it was this casino night thing that neither of us knew was going to happen.
5032000	5035000	And it was a night of random frivolity.
5035000	5041000	And it's just funny because someone taught us how to play craps, and it wasn't even that spectacular.
5041000	5052000	After all the time we spent, all the vacations we went on, and all the beautiful sunsets and all that other shit, my best memory was this random ass night.
5052000	5055000	This is so insane.
5055000	5056000	Wow.
5056000	5059000	I have a solution to get through this and end this segment.
5059000	5060000	Okay, my relationship.
5060000	5061000	Let's try.
5061000	5063000	Maybe we should have broken up.
5063000	5064000	Maybe you guys are right.
5064000	5069000	There's a way to, you know, Schrodinger's girlfriend can remain unknown.
5069000	5070000	I don't know.
5070000	5071000	Maybe you guys are right.
5071000	5072000	I think you should have broken up.
5072000	5073000	I think this is good.
5073000	5074000	I'm glad you broke up.
5074000	5076000	The box doesn't have to overcome open.
5076000	5080000	Schrodinger's girlfriend can be one thing or another.
5080000	5091000	I think the thing that we can all agree on, although some people, it seems like 70% of the audience doesn't think he deserves it, I think we can all agree that Jeremy needs love.
5091000	5093000	I do.
5093000	5094000	I'm not a bad guy.
5094000	5096000	This is a count of definitely values.
5097000	5111000	The tragic truth might be that he has a cashew speech impediment having girlfriend that's a narcoleptic, whose other two qualities are that she just likes to kiss and then stare at him.
5111000	5114000	It was cute.
5114000	5116000	In which case, Bullet dodged.
5116000	5118000	You're going to find a better girl than that.
5118000	5122000	Truthfully, you're already more interesting than that.
5122000	5124000	Let's thank Jeremy that means everybody.
5124000	5125000	Jeremy and Eva.
5125000	5126000	Show Jeremy you love him.
5126000	5127000	I love you, Jeremy.
5127000	5129000	I love you, Jeremy.
5129000	5130000	And thank you.
5130000	5132000	What was her name?
5132000	5133000	Eva.
5133000	5134000	Eva.
5134000	5135000	Thank you, Eva.
5135000	5138000	I don't think there were any heroes or villains in that story.
5138000	5140000	I think that was one of the most interesting.
5140000	5141000	Oh, thank you, buddy.
5141000	5143000	God bless you, Jeremy.
5143000	5145000	Let's bring our dungeon master Spencer Christian.
5145000	5147000	Spencer Christian!
5147000	5150000	Oh!
5151000	5153000	Hey, can you guys hear me?
5153000	5154000	Am I audible?
5154000	5155000	Yeah.
5155000	5156000	I can't hear myself.
5156000	5157000	You can't hear yourself?
5157000	5161000	When I was dating Mandy, she hated odd numbers.
5161000	5166000	She dotted all her ellipses with four periods.
5166000	5173000	She loved to feed birds, crows, you know, French fries in the park.
5173000	5177000	And she had this really weird toe.
5178000	5181000	Man, when you're in love, obnoxious things are real cute.
5181000	5183000	That was a very interesting moment.
5183000	5186000	And the beauty to me is, I don't know that any of us,
5186000	5189000	I mean, maybe there's a few people in the audience, Jeremy will be one of them,
5189000	5191000	that knows the exact truth about this.
5191000	5194000	But there was a division there and people felt it instantly.
5194000	5197000	And is it just that people instantly got a vibe off of them
5197000	5202000	or there was truly something that was said that sounded like fallacious or both?
5202000	5204000	It was all of the above.
5204000	5208000	Also, Jeremy, when he speaks, he has this kind of lightness
5208000	5212000	and this kind of laugh in his voice, and that makes it hard to believe.
5212000	5214000	Some people mask pain that way.
5214000	5217000	And also, people coming up on stage, it may be like, for the first time,
5217000	5219000	or maybe not comfortable to come up here under that kind of scrutiny,
5219000	5222000	although he did seek it out himself, to come up.
5222000	5226000	People do behave strangely on microphone and under the light,
5226000	5228000	so I think you have to dispense a little bit of leeway for that.
5228000	5229000	Yeah.
5229000	5231000	Definitely one thing we've learned in Harmon Chatter is that, you know,
5231000	5239000	everyone's welcome up on stage, but because there's always a bunch of people
5239000	5242000	in the audience and they know that you can kind of come up on stage,
5242000	5246000	when you do come up on stage, you have two strikes against you
5246000	5248000	because everyone in the audience is going,
5248000	5251000	the fuck, I paid $20, I'm not coming up on stage.
5251000	5252000	Fuck you.
5252000	5256000	You know, even when we ask, that's a thing that you have against you.
5256000	5258000	And I'm not saying that's right or it's wrong,
5258000	5260000	but that's a thing you have against you.
5260000	5263000	I feel like, I'm just, I've already said it, but like,
5263000	5265000	he could have said, like, I like chocolate chip cookies,
5265000	5269000	and if James Earl Jones came up from the back and was like, no he doesn't,
5269000	5274000	like, that's so interesting that, like, your brain just goes like,
5274000	5276000	whoa, I think he doesn't.
5276000	5278000	I mean, it's not like we're in some small town.
5278000	5281000	This is a big city we're in, and somebody came up.
5281000	5282000	Turns out it's a little smaller.
5282000	5286000	Yeah, no, no, this is like our town right now.
5286000	5290000	I run the bike shop down on 3rd and Walton.
5290000	5292000	And this young man's...
5292000	5294000	Jacuzza! Jacuzza!
5294000	5296000	He never seemed in love.
5296000	5301000	He's been using his broken heart to steal watches and coin purses
5301000	5307000	outside my malt shop for nigh unto two harvests.
5307000	5310000	And then a gal with a sweater and a fedora came up on stage
5310000	5313000	and was just like, kind of semi to fully convinced that.
5313000	5314000	It was just bullshit.
5314000	5316000	She was an intriguing character, too.
5316000	5318000	I wish the people that were listening could...
5318000	5320000	I don't know how they could see those people.
5320000	5321000	Can we all go to... what was your place called?
5321000	5322000	Boogaloo's, Hooby Doobies?
5322000	5323000	What was it?
5323000	5324000	Hooby Doobies.
5324000	5326000	Boogaloo's?
5326000	5328000	Is it a restaurant? Bar? What is it?
5328000	5329000	I imagine it's a place that sells balloons.
5329000	5330000	That's the thing.
5330000	5333000	I want you to know, if you're listening in New Jersey, Milwaukee, Kansas,
5333000	5337000	wherever you're listening, just know that Jeremy was not a bad-looking man
5337000	5342000	and also the girl that came up and inexplicably accused him of being a sociopath.
5342000	5344000	Also, like, very put together.
5344000	5346000	It was just weird. It was just weird to me.
5346000	5349000	I thought they were going to end up together.
5349000	5352000	Didn't it seem like they would end up like...
5352000	5356000	They both looked like characters from, like, a CW show or something.
5356000	5361000	Like, one of them didn't have an extra head or leg braces
5361000	5364000	or, like, you know, it was obese or anything like that.
5364000	5366000	And I'm so sorry, I just offended Oliver.
5366000	5367000	I don't know.
5367000	5369000	Leg brace having obese listeners.
5369000	5371000	I'm not saying you're not worthy of being on a CW show.
5371000	5373000	I'm just saying that...
5373000	5376000	I just wish that happened so earlier on in the show
5376000	5378000	so we could do this for the next 17 hours.
5378000	5380000	Yeah. One Tree Telegraph Hill.
5380000	5381000	I didn't know.
5381000	5382000	I hate mystery.
5382000	5385000	When Maury Povich realized that you could just do paternity tests all the time,
5385000	5386000	now I just...
5386000	5388000	Why isn't Hermitown just always like,
5388000	5390000	okay, anybody got anything to say?
5390000	5392000	Is he lying?
5392000	5394000	Somebody's like, I think so.
5394000	5395000	Fuck it.
5395000	5397000	It writes itself.
5397000	5402000	It's so much more interesting than us jawn about Dolly Parton for two hours.
5402000	5404000	But the thing is, that's amazing.
5404000	5408000	We do a show in Hollywood in the back room of a comic book store
5408000	5410000	and there's a team of people that come.
5410000	5412000	We have our little Muppet show of regulars that come.
5412000	5413000	And they're all fucking...
5413000	5415000	There's a guy named Adam Goldberg that certain people love
5415000	5417000	and certain people don't love and there's this and that.
5417000	5419000	But, like, you can come all the way up to Cobbs
5419000	5421000	and there's a fucking brand new Adam Goldberg.
5421000	5424000	It's amazing.
5424000	5425000	We don't have much time.
5425000	5429000	We should probably go to the D&D while we still have a little bit of daylight.
5430000	5432000	So, should I hand these out?
5432000	5434000	Let's hand out the character sheets if we could.
5434000	5437000	For those of you who are first timers to Hermitown,
5437000	5440000	Spencer is Dungeon Master extraordinaire.
5442000	5445000	Who has the noble and ignominious task
5445000	5448000	of trying to wrangle our drug and booze-addled brains
5448000	5452000	into once a week trying to play the same campaign of D&D.
5453000	5454000	Last week was Super Bowl.
5454000	5457000	I was as drunk as I've been in Hermitown since last year
5457000	5460000	when I was here at the Punch Lion.
5460000	5462000	Yeah, you were gone, man.
5462000	5464000	No, no, I was fucking... I was Steamboat Willie, baby.
5464000	5468000	I was Busy McTavish and I really...
5468000	5472000	I would read my notes from last week, but they're in Sanskrit.
5474000	5477000	Okay, so Joel, you're this character named Christa Berg.
5478000	5480000	All right.
5480000	5482000	Aside from being a rogue,
5482000	5486000	he also created the song Lady in Red.
5493000	5495000	Wow, these notes suck.
5495000	5498000	Fortunately, we have Spencer to recap for us what happened last week.
5498000	5500000	Are you ready to go on that, Spencer?
5500000	5502000	Ready, ready.
5503000	5505000	Yay, Spencer.
5506000	5509000	When we last met, our heroes had made with...
5509000	5513000	had made with Lenev, had met with Lenev.
5514000	5517000	This is why you don't build stuff up, liar.
5517000	5519000	No, you didn't!
5519000	5522000	The skeleton man from Tormod Tour.
5522000	5525000	On the way to the city, Lenev began explaining
5525000	5527000	the customs of the underworld
5527000	5531000	while Mulrain stabbed Quark for having too many hit points.
5532000	5534000	After hearing a noise,
5534000	5536000	Quark approached a battered hut,
5536000	5540000	slaying its undead occupants and violating their corpses.
5540000	5543000	Lenev led the gang into the broken city,
5543000	5547000	past the crumbling walls and into the forsaken chapel.
5547000	5550000	There they met the three bonesages of Tormod Tour,
5550000	5554000	who revealed to our heroes the location of the Teragon of Virtue,
5554000	5557000	high upon the floating isle of Paradise.
5557000	5561000	With the Teragon, they could finally heal Krista Berg of his possession.
5561000	5563000	But before the gang could leave,
5563000	5566000	Lenev began... began spitting and cussing,
5566000	5570000	demanding that the party be brought to justice for their crimes.
5570000	5573000	The bonesages didn't seem so enthusiastic about this,
5573000	5577000	but decided to enact the rights of Telemvarna.
5577000	5580000	But what were the rights of Telemvarna?
5580000	5582000	And how could our party escape?
5582000	5583000	And what did it mean?
5583000	5586000	Is it some sort of aim or something?
5586000	5590000	A historical figure? We'll find out tonight.
5597000	5599000	So you got all that, Joel?
5601000	5603000	Especially, one quick thing.
5603000	5604000	What's the thing?
5604000	5607000	The Teragon of Virtue is on the floating isle of Paradise,
5607000	5609000	and they start invoking the rights of what?
5609000	5610000	Telemvarna.
5610000	5611000	Telemvarna?
5611000	5614000	Yeah, the bonesages, they're looking at you.
5614000	5617000	And they're saying, we have to enact these rights.
5617000	5619000	These rights of Telemvarna.
5619000	5622000	Telemvarna!
5625000	5628000	Chains as black as night fire from the shadowy rafters,
5628000	5630000	striking you in the chest and sending a cold,
5630000	5632000	clammy pressure into your bodies.
5632000	5637000	You feel claws gripping at your very soul as dark energy envelops you.
5637000	5640000	You see several silent figures hooded in black
5640000	5643000	filing into the church, standing around you in a circle.
5644000	5648000	Everyone in the church is also chained by these black chains.
5651000	5655000	I go into a barbarian rage and wrestle to try to get free of my chains.
5655000	5656000	Okay.
5656000	5658000	Flying into a barbarian rage,
5658000	5662000	you attempt to extricate yourself from the shadowy chains.
5663000	5665000	That one would have fell off the table.
5666000	5668000	You rip, you rip with all your might,
5668000	5672000	you rip out the chain, and with it, your soul.
5672000	5674000	Oh, shit.
5675000	5677000	I put it back in.
5678000	5680000	Rookie mistake.
5680000	5682000	With the black chains.
5682000	5685000	As you rip the chain out of your body, you feel yourself die,
5685000	5688000	but as you slump forward into the chain that you ripped out of your body,
5688000	5691000	your soul re-enters and you feel yourself live.
5691000	5693000	Jesus Christ.
5693000	5697000	Everybody, leave the chains until we figure out a better way.
5698000	5700000	What happened?
5700000	5701000	Grandpa was there.
5703000	5705000	Did you fucking die?
5705000	5707000	My soul was gone.
5707000	5708000	I think.
5708000	5710000	I felt soulless.
5710000	5712000	What was different?
5720000	5723000	A hundred and thirty people got a joke before I did.
5727000	5730000	I don't stab mooring.
5733000	5737000	Okay, so we're tethered with black Hellraiser chains
5737000	5740000	that are tethered to our souls.
5740000	5742000	Yes.
5742000	5745000	Do I get experience points for restating that?
5745000	5746000	No.
5746000	5749000	Hey, Christoperg, how are you doing?
5749000	5753000	I'm doing great, and I'm wondering why we're in a church.
5754000	5756000	It's because you've been possessed, Christoperg,
5756000	5758000	and we're trying to get the tarragon of virtue,
5758000	5760000	which will release you from your possession.
5760000	5762000	We're here to help you because you've been a real weirdo lately.
5762000	5764000	Should I do a different voice, or?
5774000	5775000	Joel, Joel.
5775000	5777000	I'm a kind of goofy fucker.
5778000	5781000	Oh, I'm obsessed with fun.
5783000	5786000	I'm going twerking wallet around the room.
5787000	5788000	It's fun.
5788000	5790000	It doesn't seem so bad.
5793000	5796000	The voice is identical to my dad's tickle voice.
5797000	5798000	I yell...
5798000	5800000	Oh, here it comes.
5801000	5802000	I yell to Lenev.
5802000	5803000	Lenev, what the hell's going on?
5803000	5805000	Tell him Varna.
5805000	5807000	That's what's going on.
5807000	5808000	Hey, Lenev.
5808000	5809000	Yeah.
5809000	5811000	When I get out of these chains,
5811000	5814000	I'm going to fucking make your bones wish
5814000	5817000	that they're bones bones.
5818000	5820000	We're broken.
5820000	5821000	Fuck.
5821000	5823000	Wait, give me a second.
5823000	5825000	I'm threatening a skeleton.
5825000	5826000	I need to throw this to a road.
5826000	5828000	You're going to wish...
5828000	5830000	You're going to wish...
5830000	5832000	I'm going to make your...
5832000	5833000	I'm going to make shit.
5833000	5834000	Your marrow.
5834000	5836000	Because they don't have muscles or meat.
5836000	5837000	Right.
5837000	5840000	I'm going to lick now.
5840000	5843000	Hey, Lenev, when I get out of this,
5843000	5847000	I'm going to lick you on your bones.
5847000	5848000	Oh.
5848000	5852000	I use my bluff,
5852000	5854000	and I look to...
5854000	5855000	Top top?
5855000	5858000	What's one of the Tauric...
5858000	5860000	Tormite of Tor?
5860000	5862000	One of the skeletons.
5862000	5863000	What's the skeleton?
5863000	5864000	They're named the same name.
5864000	5865000	The bone sages?
5865000	5866000	Yeah.
5866000	5867000	Tor or Maude?
5867000	5868000	Tor.
5868000	5869000	Second Tor.
5869000	5870000	Oh, that's right.
5870000	5871000	Thanks, guys.
5871000	5872000	Second Tor.
5872000	5874000	I use bluff, and I look at Second Tor,
5874000	5875000	and I say,
5875000	5883000	Oh, hey, it's me from that class.
5883000	5884000	You're just trying to use, like,
5884000	5886000	Jonathan Silverman romantic comedy
5886000	5889000	pick-up techniques on them.
5889000	5890000	Ashley?
5890000	5892000	Ashley from Roosevelt High?
5892000	5894000	Hey, wow.
5894000	5899000	You really stayed thin.
5899000	5901000	This is so uncomfortable,
5901000	5903000	because there's been a big mix-up.
5903000	5908000	If you could just let this chain grasp off my soul,
5908000	5911000	we can have a party.
5911000	5912000	Roll it.
5912000	5915000	I did.
5915000	5919000	The rights of Telumvarna cannot be shed so easily.
5919000	5921000	Telumvarna!
5921000	5923000	What are the rights of Telumvarna?
5923000	5926000	It's this whole thing.
5926000	5929000	Hey, Tor and Maude.
5929000	5930000	And another Tor.
5930000	5931000	They look over.
5931000	5936000	I'm not gonna pretend that I know you guys,
5936000	5940000	but I will double the offer on the party
5940000	5943000	if you let these chains off,
5943000	5944000	if you know what I mean.
5944000	5948000	And I press my tongue on the inside of my cheek
5948000	5956000	to simulate the head of a dick.
5956000	5959000	And I explain to them that if my hands were free,
5960000	5962000	I would take the left one
5962000	5968000	and encircle the hand the width of a shaft
5968000	5971000	near the opening of my mouth
5971000	5975000	and move it in tandem with the tongue movement
5975000	5978000	so that the net result was the appearance
5978000	5980000	that I was rubbing a dick,
5980000	5982000	just washing my mouth with a dick,
5982000	5985000	just rubbing a hard dick.
5985000	5988000	John, it was a bird dog, a bird dog.
5988000	5990000	Oh, he really got it on with dudes.
5990000	5991000	But I explain that to them verbally,
5991000	5996000	and I'm saying, if you let me go, I'm yours.
5996000	5999000	They look at you and they're like,
5999000	6002000	again, cannot be shed so easily.
6002000	6006000	Somebody explain to me the rights of Telumvarna.
6006000	6009000	Well, Telumvarna shall watch over us all,
6009000	6012000	and may sinners be shackled in darkness.
6012000	6014000	The ceremony will begin soon.
6014000	6017000	Will the guilty party please step forward?
6018000	6020000	I step forward.
6020000	6022000	Well, then.
6022000	6025000	That's literally never worked before.
6029000	6031000	Hey, guys.
6031000	6033000	I only deal with honesty.
6033000	6035000	And yeah, I'm guilty.
6035000	6039000	I'm guilty of wanting to have a party.
6039000	6042000	And I take my stomach,
6042000	6044000	and I go back like I've been hit in the stomach,
6044000	6046000	but I do it in a way that it's like a dick.
6046000	6049000	I'm like, you can put your dick in my belly.
6049000	6051000	Wait, what?
6051000	6055000	Put your dick all the way in my belly.
6055000	6058000	I, like, gyrate like there's a dick in my belly.
6058000	6061000	And then I look to my friends and I give them a question.
6061000	6064000	You had to one-up my mouth thing, I understand.
6064000	6066000	There's only one thing bigger than a mouth,
6066000	6068000	and that's your whole stomach, yeah.
6068000	6073000	And second tour, my belly button's tight.
6073000	6077000	Oh, I'm Christi Berg, and I wasn't here tonight.
6077000	6082000	You guys know that, like, boners aren't really bones.
6082000	6085000	Like, skeletons don't have dicks.
6085000	6086000	No, but...
6086000	6088000	Well, I'm sure they have phantom dicks.
6088000	6090000	By you saying that, we've achieved a connection
6090000	6093000	because you can tell that we're trying to give you a boner.
6093000	6094000	We never said that.
6094000	6096000	Oh, no, that was me, the dungeon master.
6096000	6097000	Oh.
6097000	6099000	It's just been bothering me.
6099000	6101000	What are you, backseat playing?
6101000	6103000	That's all like, yeah, kinda?
6103000	6108000	So if you were playing, you wouldn't try to give them a boner.
6108000	6110000	I mean, I...
6110000	6112000	I mean, don't stop there, tell us what you'd do.
6112000	6116000	I might try it once, and then, you know, if it didn't work, I wouldn't try it again.
6116000	6118000	That's not how you get boners, man.
6118000	6124000	Like, if people stopped at the first attempt, the species would be extinct.
6124000	6129000	Like, the first person that ever tried to get a person to have a boner, like, used a leaf.
6129000	6130000	And it didn't work.
6130000	6132000	You think the first boner was attempted?
6132000	6135000	Then they used two leaves, and they got a boner, hence seven billion people.
6135000	6140000	Hey, Spencer, I'd be kind of offended there's a man trying to train you in on how to have a boner.
6140000	6143000	That's what I'm saying, you don't use leaves.
6143000	6144000	What are you talking about?
6144000	6147000	That's my point, too, you're just making my point.
6147000	6150000	You know, statistically, someone in this room has a boner.
6150000	6154000	Liar!
6154000	6159000	Jeremy's boner!
6159000	6162000	That's the only song about a guy singing about another guy's dick.
6162000	6165000	Jeremy's boner.
6165000	6175000	Oh, he has a turgid weirdness inside the fog of the penis to find it.
6175000	6178000	Tell him, Bon Sage, what is he accused of?
6178000	6186000	Teenage flow!
6186000	6191000	Heart is rock inside my prayers.
6191000	6199000	Oh, in the nineties, all you had to do was eat the mic.
6199000	6206000	It'll sound like you'll sing singing about a boner.
6206000	6211000	I take my mighty greatsword and try to sever my chains.
6211000	6213000	Because this time I think it won't steal my soul.
6214000	6227000	You severed the chain and it just kind of drops to the floor and evaporates.
6227000	6231000	You see the end that's on your side, shall we say?
6231000	6234000	It starts slowly disintegrating towards your body.
6234000	6239000	If you looked at it, it looks like it might take about 10 minutes to finish dissolving.
6239000	6241000	The guys just kind of look at you.
6241000	6244000	They're like, I mean, I guess you could do that.
6244000	6247000	That's not a good idea.
6247000	6251000	I start running around in circles nervously.
6251000	6252000	All right, that happens.
6252000	6253000	Can I do something?
6253000	6254000	Let me know when I can do something.
6254000	6256000	Anybody could do anything they want.
6256000	6258000	I want to reduce myself.
6258000	6260000	I have reduced person.
6260000	6261000	Okay.
6261000	6263000	This is my go-to for getting out of...
6263000	6264000	That happens.
6264000	6265000	You're smaller.
6265000	6268000	Yeah, so I get out of the chains.
6268000	6271000	No, no, it's you're not like chained up.
6271000	6273000	You have a chain going into your chest.
6273000	6275000	It's like stabbing up in there.
6275000	6279000	Guys, I got a 10 minute fuse that's going to steal my soul in a second.
6279000	6282000	I'm a soul bomb right now.
6282000	6289000	I coughed to cover up me saying that I was guilty and I tried to cut off my chains and my sword.
6289000	6291000	I'm the guilty one.
6291000	6293000	And then I tried to cut off my...
6293000	6297000	You don't quite have as much success as Quark does.
6297000	6298000	You clash into it.
6298000	6300000	I don't know what you do with chains.
6300000	6303000	You slice into it, but it just plinks off.
6303000	6304000	No.
6304000	6305000	No, I'm possessed.
6305000	6308000	Can I read my chart if I'm possessed?
6308000	6309000	Wait, read your chart?
6309000	6310000	Yeah.
6310000	6315000	Well, it says here I have the power of weapon of sap.
6315000	6316000	Yeah, sap.
6316000	6321000	I think I'll use that.
6321000	6322000	What do you want to use it on?
6322000	6325000	I'll squirt it on the skeleton.
6325000	6326000	No, it's not like syrup.
6326000	6327000	It's not like tree sap.
6327000	6328000	Well, you don't know that.
6328000	6329000	No.
6329000	6330000	It's a weapon.
6330000	6331000	I'll think you whack somebody.
6331000	6334000	It just means that you fall victim to a lot of old-timey pranks.
6334000	6335000	Oh, excuse me.
6335000	6338000	I'm going to not use my weapon yet then.
6338000	6342000	If it's not sap, I don't want to play.
6342000	6347000	All right, fuck you, gaseous form.
6347000	6348000	Okay.
6348000	6349000	Gaseous what?
6349000	6351000	What do you say, gaseous corn?
6351000	6354000	All right, fuck you, gaseous corn.
6354000	6355000	No, gaseous form.
6355000	6357000	I'm casting gaseous form.
6357000	6362000	You know, it turns me into like a fart.
6362000	6363000	You do that.
6363000	6365000	You become a gaseous form.
6365000	6367000	The one who cast it blasted.
6367000	6368000	Gaseous.
6368000	6369000	Not gaseous.
6369000	6374000	The chain is still going into your gaseous form, and you see like a lighter glowing cloud
6374000	6376000	inside of your cloud.
6376000	6378000	That's your soul, man.
6378000	6382000	Chance to gut your soul, Jack.
6382000	6386000	I'm running around because I have a 10-minute fuse on my chest, and I start running looking
6386000	6388000	for exits or any sort of egress.
6388000	6393000	For some reason, you can't seem to break the barrier of standing hooded figures ringing
6393000	6394000	you.
6394000	6397000	Oh, yeah.
6397000	6402000	I do a cleave flaming sword attack through the hooded figures around me.
6402000	6403000	All right.
6403000	6406000	If your sword cuts them at all, it doesn't seem to have any effect.
6406000	6410000	It slices through it as easily as if they were a gaseous form.
6410000	6411000	It's embarrassing.
6411000	6413000	Guys, we're running along.
6413000	6415000	We've got to bring us into the station.
6415000	6416000	Mod speaks up.
6416000	6417000	Mod speaks up.
6417000	6419000	Now tell him Varna is happening.
6419000	6421000	I already said that.
6421000	6424000	You must elect a defendant.
6424000	6425000	Me.
6425000	6427000	I'm the defendant.
6427000	6428000	Do it.
6428000	6433000	It's not like a defendant in the other usage of the terms.
6433000	6437000	It's more like a defense attorney, really.
6437000	6439000	I defend myself.
6439000	6441000	All right.
6441000	6445000	If you shall be the defendant, then tell him Varna shall continue.
6445000	6447000	Varna shall continue.
6447000	6448000	Wait.
6448000	6450000	Why are you telling me what to say?
6450000	6453000	I wasn't.
6453000	6455000	I am the defendant, and I defend myself.
6455000	6457000	I am the guilty party.
6457000	6459000	Prepare your case, then.
6459000	6462000	All right.
6462000	6463000	I don't know.
6463000	6464000	I don't know.
6464000	6466000	What is my crime?
6466000	6468000	That's not how this works.
6468000	6469000	Okay.
6469000	6470000	All right.
6470000	6471000	Well, okay.
6471000	6474000	I'm still just running around stabbing gaseous people around the room.
6474000	6476000	Still not doing anything.
6476000	6477000	All right.
6477000	6480000	I put cardboard paper on Leviticus' head.
6480000	6481000	Leviticus?
6481000	6482000	And?
6482000	6483000	Lenev.
6483000	6486000	Boy, what a mistake.
6486000	6489000	Laverne deserved more.
6489000	6492000	I have a horse.
6492000	6493000	Jesus.
6493000	6497000	And I will do anything to protect this crew.
6497000	6501000	We are on a journey searching something.
6501000	6504000	And I went...
6504000	6505000	Sorry?
6505000	6506000	Own it.
6506000	6507000	Own it or apologize?
6507000	6508000	Apologize?
6508000	6509000	Fuck you.
6509000	6514000	I'm on my way to murder the shadow in the crowd.
6514000	6515000	Wow.
6515000	6517000	I shall not apologize.
6517000	6519000	My mother was a balloon.
6519000	6521000	I love popsicles.
6521000	6523000	Let's have a party.
6523000	6525000	I'll go underground and we'll gather a...
6525000	6526000	I'll pull her chains out of her chest.
6526000	6529000	As hard as I can, I pull her chains out.
6529000	6540000	I put my bag of nuts in her mouth.
6540000	6546000	I have an actual bag of nuts.
6546000	6549000	I cast mirror image.
6549000	6550000	Yeah, yeah.
6550000	6553000	And so there's another version of me on the other side of the room.
6553000	6554000	There's four more versions of you.
6554000	6555000	Yeah.
6555000	6557000	But one of them steps forward and says,
6557000	6563000	All right, that will do.
6563000	6567000	I think they've learned their lesson.
6567000	6571000	And then we all wink and then we all jump in the air and high five.
6571000	6575000	Set them free and let's proceed.
6575000	6580000	You say those things, but yeah.
6580000	6583000	I started swallowing my rope.
6583000	6584000	Okay.
6584000	6586000	I use one of my other mirror image guys to go like,
6586000	6593000	Don't believe him.
6593000	6595000	And then the guy he's talking about goes like,
6595000	6596000	Fuck you.
6596000	6598000	And it's like, no, fuck you.
6598000	6599000	And the other guy goes like,
6599000	6600000	I hate skeletons.
6600000	6602000	And I go,
6602000	6605000	And the other one just goes away.
6605000	6606000	And I go like,
6606000	6609000	You're welcome now.
6609000	6611000	Now that I've taken care of your enemy,
6611000	6613000	the guy that hates skeletons.
6613000	6617000	And I look at second tour and I open my eyes real wide and I say,
6617000	6623000	Cashew.
6623000	6624000	Cashew.
6624000	6625000	And then I fall.
6625000	6628000	I take a little nap.
6628000	6629000	All right.
6629000	6630000	What's the result of all that?
6630000	6632000	Come on.
6632000	6633000	The first tour,
6633000	6635000	he looks on you with kindness,
6635000	6640000	but the other two are very clearly not buying this.
6640000	6643000	Why?
6643000	6645000	Like Doug Benson is backstage guy.
6645000	6647000	I was, I had a 10 o'clock show.
6647000	6648000	I was supposed to.
6648000	6649000	No, Doug Benson is backstage going,
6649000	6651000	Yeah, I get it.
6651000	6653000	He's, he's the only one.
6653000	6655000	Uh, the, uh,
6655000	6656000	Finishes Harman.
6656000	6657000	Big, uh,
6657000	6661000	closing monologue by Sharpie to end the show.
6661000	6662000	No pressure.
6662000	6666000	These shackles
6666000	6668000	fasten my wrists.
6668000	6671000	And these chains go into my soul,
6671000	6675000	but there's something more powerful than wrists,
6675000	6679000	more valuable than souls.
6679000	6684000	And I refuse to tell you what it is
6684000	6689000	because usually when someone talks about something more valuable,
