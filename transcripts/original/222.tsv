0	20840	Welcome to Meltdown Comics, from Hollywood, California.
20840	26000	Harmon Town is now in session.
27000	34000	Tonight, the role of Spencer Kretman will be played by Aaron McGathey.
48000	52000	And the role of mayor will be played by Dan Harmon.
57000	65000	Thank you very much.
65000	69000	There's some points of order to be made.
69000	72000	Now, here's one of them.
72000	76000	To our friends at me undies.
76000	82000	Who are not, I don't believe they're not paying for any advertising tonight, but I want to address them.
83000	91000	I have a problem at my home with my underwear, which is the following.
91000	97000	I have two dogs, adopted by Ms. McGathey and myself.
97000	102000	The two dogs are now in my charge.
102000	108000	And the smaller of them, Nigel, eats the underwear.
109000	117000	I'm asking me undies if I can have another box of me undies.
117000	124000	Because I've gotten two shipments from them, and now I still own two pairs of underwear that are functional.
124000	129000	However, I just want to say that you understand that I'm the victim here.
129000	135000	Dan, please figure out how to throw your underwear or put it in a hamper or something.
135000	141000	Don't leave it on the floor. The dog loves you. He wants to eat your piss and your shit.
141000	146000	And that's true. Yes, you're right. I'm trying. I'm trying to learn.
146000	148000	I don't enjoy not having underwear.
148000	153000	But I just want to create a map of the cosmos for you to understand that you should feel sorry for me.
153000	156000	Because here's the thing.
156000	161000	This little fucker eats. He didn't do this when you were around.
161000	166000	He started eating all the furniture when Aaron and I started divorcing.
166000	168000	Ads up.
168000	170000	Ads up?
170000	175000	I'm just trying to... I don't know if I should do an impression of Spencer, or I'm just trying to be fair.
175000	180000	I, for one, would like to hear you try.
180000	183000	Okay.
183000	185000	Yeah.
185000	187000	That happens.
188000	192000	Oh, that dog. That dog eats all that underwear.
192000	196000	Yeah, that dog. That dog really does that.
196000	201000	Maybe you shouldn't leave it on the floor.
201000	206000	So, this little fucker, he eats perfect...
206000	215000	He eats the fabric that was touching where my penis and asshole are.
215000	220000	Because he loves... He's a dog. He thinks that's my wallet.
220000	223000	He thinks that's a locket.
223000	228000	In dog terms, they call that flavor country.
228000	230000	Yeah.
230000	233000	You notice they sniff your crotch, they sniff your butt.
233000	237000	They're going like, oh, hello, Carl.
237000	240000	I see you're allergic to coffee or something.
240000	250000	You're thinking, all right. So, he eats, but he eats perfect, perfect holes right where the junk and the trunk are.
250000	253000	And so, here's the thing, just so you understand that I'm a victim.
253000	255000	Wait, two separate holes or one...
255000	257000	Two separate holes.
257000	260000	He eats a junk hole and a trunk hole.
260000	261000	Yes.
261000	264000	It just sounds like he wants you to explore a new fetish.
264000	268000	Try not to get ahead of me here.
268000	273000	So, here is the part where you say, Dan, I feel bad for you.
273000	277000	It's not out of property loss, which I'm asking me undies to...
277000	279000	Maybe they could reimburse.
279000	282000	I don't know if the reimburse is the right word.
282000	287000	Re-up. Bail out. It's a bail out.
287000	291000	And you don't need to go... Yeah, I got a variety pack last time.
291000	300000	Let's target the boxer-briefy more things, like the bikini-style ones are only good for an Instagram now and then.
300000	303000	What are you rocking right now?
303000	313000	Probably a good old-fashioned cotton pair of Calvin Klein's that are one-third the softness of modal.
313000	317000	Are you saying that me undies are too delicious for dogs?
317000	321000	Well, he never ate the crotch out of my... Now, I don't want to start that business.
321000	326000	I don't want to be one of those people when the iPhone came out and people are like,
326000	331000	did you know the screen gets degraded faster when you eat pizza?
331000	334000	I'm not an alarmist. I'm a futurist.
334000	337000	And I'm an underwear softness advocate.
337000	341000	Even if I thought that was the case, I would pull back on that information.
341000	346000	I'd be like a tobacco company. I'd be like, come on, let's get all the data.
347000	350000	Here's the thing.
350000	359000	So, my soon-to-be-thrown-over-a-historical-wall housekeeper...
361000	364000	...who is terrified right now...
364000	367000	Wait, don't you and I have the same housekeeper?
367000	368000	What's that? Yeah.
368000	369000	We have the same housekeeper.
369000	371000	Is she documented?
371000	373000	I'm not gonna fucking ask.
373000	376000	She's coming to my place tomorrow.
376000	379000	So, plan for the worst, hope for the best.
379000	382000	You're not gonna sell her out, are you?
382000	384000	No, I'm gonna...
384000	387000	You just threatened to throw her over a historical wall.
387000	392000	I said soon-to-be. I didn't say soon-to-be by me.
392000	396000	I'm building a fucking wall. It wasn't my platform. I'm not a sociopath.
397000	402000	I'm not a fucking kleptocratic fucking pathological monster man.
403000	405000	I'm a monster man.
409000	416000	I didn't run for the dumbest job in the world after failing at nine slightly worse ones.
417000	419000	Be born into a trust fund.
419000	425000	And the show that started with you complaining about how your free underwear gets eaten by your rescue dog.
425000	430000	We also just bonded over that we have the same possibly non-documented housekeeper.
430000	433000	Right, yes. And you notice I'm not like...
433000	437000	What about my housekeeper? I'm just saying she's part of this story.
438000	440000	Now imagine what she's going through.
440000	441000	Right.
441000	445000	She came to my place one time after coming from your place.
445000	448000	To clean my place after cleaning your place.
448000	452000	And she looked really, really shagged out. She looked really tired.
453000	456000	That had to be when Aaron was living with me.
458000	461000	You guys were together back then, but that's not the point.
461000	465000	She's like, Jeff, thank you for letting me in.
465000	469000	I go, how are you doing, Sophia? And she's like, I'm so tired. I'm so tired.
469000	473000	I go, why? And she goes, you know Harvey?
473000	475000	Because you're a golden doodle.
475000	477000	I go, yeah, I know Harvey.
477000	483000	And she just puts her backpack down in my kitchen and she starts washing the dishes.
485000	489000	Harvey, he eats all the trash.
492000	494000	He eats all the trash.
495000	499000	Harvey would do that once in a while, but very intelligent dog.
502000	506000	What? He learned, he learned. He's a very empathic dog, Harvey.
506000	509000	Nigel is a fucking disaster.
509000	513000	Nigel is just like, look, you talk to parents, they have a favorite kid, they won't admit it.
513000	515000	They know that's bad parenting. You're not supposed to do that.
515000	518000	They have a favorite kid. They like one kid better than the other kid.
518000	522000	That's not well documented. Sophia probably is.
525000	530000	Let's assume so. But you don't say, but we all know it's true.
531000	536000	Especially if one comes from a breeder and is amazingly intelligent,
536000	542000	the combination of two thoroughbred species of a breed of dog that are renowned for their intelligence,
542000	547000	and the other is just a mishmash of rescue crap from Echo Park.
549000	554000	Aren't mutts notoriously more savvy because of the broader gene pool?
555000	562000	No, that applies to like, oh, let's mix a Sheltie with a Jack Russell, so maybe he'll...
562000	564000	Jack Russell's the fucking worst.
564000	567000	Don't get too fucking sidetracked, okay?
568000	573000	You're supposed to be the anti-tangent guy. You're supposed to keep me on rails.
573000	576000	Oh, that reminds me. I was having an enchilada today.
578000	581000	And I'm fucking it. And I mean fucking it.
581000	583000	So here's the situation.
583000	587000	So imagine when I open my underwear drawer.
588000	590000	I imagine this every morning.
591000	597000	And the underwear drawer is basically full, even though I'm like...
598000	605000	And then I pull out each pair of underwear, and it's got this hole in the crotch and hole in the butt.
606000	611000	So here I am, a man deprived of his property by his mutt,
612000	616000	and his housekeeper is folding, neatly washing and folding,
616000	619000	because she thinks I'm a fucking sex monster.
622000	624000	I can't have that conversation with her.
624000	629000	Hold up. How many pairs, how many multiple pairs, not just one?
630000	633000	Every fucking pair that's ever touched the floor...
633000	636000	From me undies. Only from me undies?
636000	638000	I think maybe no. I think maybe he...
638000	640000	Look, I told you I didn't want to get into that.
640000	642000	I have a lot of questions.
642000	648000	I feel like he's gotten... No, I have cotton underwear that has this treatment done to it.
648000	649000	Are you trying to...
649000	654000	I do think it's possible that the modal, which is a fabric three times softer than cotton.
654000	658000	Let's do a free ad for them right now, because we're not even supposed to do an ad for them today.
658000	661000	I believe we are. I would highly recommend this underwear.
661000	664000	I would highly recommend you get a dog from a breeder. No, I'm kidding.
668000	673000	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Bigger fish, kids.
675000	678000	You know, Anne Frank kicked a cat once.
681000	683000	It didn't make the book.
688000	690000	She loved burgers.
692000	695000	Not a villain. She's not a villain. She's a human being.
697000	704000	But you're saying that you have a rescue dog that's going around eating the penis and butthole out of all of your me undies underwear.
704000	705000	Yes.
705000	711000	And then your Guatemalan housekeeper looks at them and thinks that you're probably a bad person.
712000	716000	And forgives it and says, oh, this is my job. This is my Latin life.
716000	719000	I'm Santa likes it naughty.
723000	733000	But when Aaron and I were first dating, not even really dating, when we were platonically friends and I was going,
733000	739000	if I can make it through this platonic friendship, maybe I can sell her on the great stuff.
742000	748000	We would we would we would party at night and like and I had a I had a mustache.
748000	755000	I had a mustache. It was my mustache when I was for Halloween was Gomez from the Adams family.
755000	760000	And then Aaron loved Aaron. You loved wearing my mustache. I did. I did. I don't think I've ever seen you happier.
761000	766000	Except on your wedding night, which I wasn't there for because we got in a fight and I wasn't at your wedding night.
766000	770000	But you used to wear my mustache and you were so pleased by that.
771000	774000	Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
776000	779000	I don't know what's happening again. I'm falling for that great stuff.
787000	789000	This magic moment.
790000	793000	The you would spirit gum the mustache to your lip.
793000	796000	And they just say it wasn't like a cheese ball thing. It was like it was a really good.
797000	805000	There was a month where we were living in like a like a James Spader 80s independent film where the three of us would just hang out and drink and play party games.
805000	808000	And I would wear the mustache and no pants and just tights.
811000	815000	So and I used to eat the pussy and asshole out of all of her types.
815000	824000	The the point of this flashback being that Sophia.
826000	836000	I'm absolutely more than two occasions because we were we were doing like a lot of all nighters and then pass out and like I wasn't working on community and she would find bags of drugs everywhere.
837000	839000	She always does. She always finds bags of drugs everywhere.
840000	843000	But when I was when I was first dating Aaron.
844000	852000	Very often more than twice like because Monday night would be like with like like up till four or maybe pass out up till six whatever.
852000	855000	And then Sophia come over at eight thirty Tuesday morning.
855000	857000	So I'm more than two occasions.
857000	859000	We sleep on your Ottoman.
860000	869000	We'd be asleep downstairs on two different sofas and she'd walk in and the thing she'd see would be two bleary eyed adults realizing someone was coming in.
869000	873000	Both of them sitting bolt upright one of them a woman with a mustache.
876000	881000	And we'd quietly excuse ourselves and head upstairs and go out for a Bloody Mary.
881000	889000	But but but then but then the mustache which would be quickly ripped off and kind of put left on the kitchen bathroom sink.
889000	900000	I would always then she would neatly clean it and put it in its case and put it in a drawer like like next to the bed next to the bed.
900000	911000	Because she's like I get it. I don't get it. But I get that I don't get it. Yes.
912000	922000	I'm north of the wall. These are not wildlings. These are these are corrupted folk. These are elitists.
922000	929000	They have to go further to I had a broken garbage disposal and a broken microwave oven door like for a week.
929000	938000	She came in. I woke up one morning. She left. They were they worked. Well you better be prepared to fucking hide her and battle to the death.
938000	950000	I will battle skinheads. All right. Good. Harvey eat all the trash. I want you all to protect your housekeepers. All right.
950000	963000	All right. Now then this is war. And do you do you think about values. Do you think me undies is a good underwear company or or a worse underwear company.
963000	976000	The fact that it's delicious to dogs like I don't think it's delicious to dogs to stop spreading that rumor. I think that my shit and gross crotch pheromones are delicious to Nigel.
976000	994000	And I think it's possible. I'll go this far and say it's maybe it's possible that whereas when he eats when he does that with the Haynes or the shitty the cotton underwear that basically they kind of get torn apart and it's like just shredded and it's unmistakably dog eaten underwear that the housekeeper throws in the garbage.
994000	1018000	That model it probably what keeps it three times as soft makes it very like you have a strap on peg fetish. So he's able to he's like it's like a corn on the cob. He just like makes a little circle is like a little Yosemite Sam Robin a pirate ship with a saw.
1018000	1034000	Dan it's been it's been a year and I've you know some memories fade and some memories stick with me. But for some reason the image of your dirty underwear. I know exactly what it looks like. I have so many everything. It's such a looks delicious.
1034000	1062000	It's like a candy store in that me and Nigel used to fight over it like like lady in the tramp in the spaghetti eat. So if me undies is listening. I promise I am not because I would think that they would have a chart on their while they go. How many me undies have we given him? Is he selling them? Is he being jaded? Is he is he some kind of weird like like guy that would take take product and then he would sell it and like no I'm not one of those people.
1062000	1078000	You know like I could name a couple people that are those people that wouldn't prove I wasn't that would just am I am I just lazy. I've never gotten I've done nine thousand me and these ads. I don't have any me and these I'd never worn them.
1079000	1088000	Hey am I am I supposed to call up like like me and these and say where's my where's my undies. Who do I talk to you about this heavily.
1089000	1105000	Because I eat the I eat the penis and butt out of my own undies. You're going to love these things. I promise you that with the thing is we're not actually doing an ad right now. No we're not. This is an actual relationship.
1105000	1129000	An actual platonic relationship. Do they make it for gals too. Is it just is it just gentlemen. They sure do. You and your loved one can wear a matching underwear even. Is it right. Yeah that's true. Where's my undies. I don't have shit. We just we just told you leave you hook you up. Now you have to make the decision to move on or.
1130000	1142000	Do what America. If I cared so much about it I would have got on this earlier. But now that I realize that they're that they make dogs want to eat the butthole out of them.
1143000	1158000	Have we talked about this thing where it's like I'm trying to rise above. You know I'm sorry. OK. What's my job. Have some humor about it. But what's what's normalizing. What's going numb. Well ignoring this. So OK. I got to make jokes about this fucking Hitler situation.
1160000	1174000	This situation with the with the with the with the Bannon gerbils and the fucking whole thing and the goddamn fucking family of the damned staring into the camera while he is not going to do that.
1175000	1187000	Who are you talking about. So anyways I'm not you know I'm not a political person. I'm not as I'm a humorist. I'm a you're one of the leading satirists of our time.
1188000	1195000	I'm like a Jonathan Swift or a Will Rogers. You're like a Lily Tomlin. Sometimes this cross is over into politics if it's okra.
1197000	1208000	But so but I try to keep things light. So you make a joke. Oh knock knock who's there. Trump's a fucking fascist dictator. We're all going to die. We're all going to die. Trump's a fascist hitter. We're all going to die. We're all going to die. Who.
1211000	1214000	I don't have to answer that question. Your door's been removed from its hinges by.
1215000	1217000	Oh my God Sophia Sophia no.
1222000	1228000	So you guys came here to see a podcast. You didn't know that you're going to get biting trench in political satire like this.
1229000	1236000	This is social observation social media observation. So does anybody. You make the comment. You do that. You do the joke. I got like oh knock knock is there.
1237000	1247000	Trump says fuck fuck not. And then somebody went to people are some people are still responding. They go like oh well I think a fuck not is somebody who deletes your e-mails. Thank you.
1250000	1257000	Do you know how elections work. She's not she's not going to hang out like Mimi on Drew Carey like just to wait.
1258000	1268000	That's not what happens to the loser in election. She doesn't just like sit in the lobby and be like I'm worse. She's fucking gone and you're going to miss her.
1269000	1275000	She's she's in the woods literally. That was the last sighting of her. I hope she starts making honey or jewelry.
1276000	1298000	I hope she writes a book and it's just like oh I hope the title is noted or or or just like I can take a hint and then the whole book is just like fucking yeah or you want to see you want to see a bitch like you want to you want to not trust somebody.
1298000	1309000	Well I hope I hope it's called Good Luck and it's 200 pages and it's just like G.D.D. for like 20 pages just like good luck and the letters get smaller and smaller and smaller.
1310000	1313000	And the last picture is just Bill holding acorns.
1313000	1331000	This is a question that no one can really answer. I mean I'm assuming that Bill really wanted her to win but do you think part of them was like yeah in your face.
1332000	1341000	In your face. Because he's a guy. Because he's a guy. It's not as easy as it looks is it.
1342000	1354000	I'm going to make the assumption that he was like that the ninth time she caught him cheating on her he was like yeah but you know you could get to be president.
1354000	1364000	It's like it's like ask anybody that wrote on community it's like the phrase you'll thank me at the Emmys became a running joke.
1365000	1373000	Like by season six they had caught on where you're not going to you're not going to win an Emmy and at this point I wouldn't thank you at them.
1374000	1379000	I should not have to bring a toothbrush to work sir. It's Yahoo.
1379000	1387000	You never close your eyes anymore.
1388000	1393000	The Rubik's Stephen Merchant.
1394000	1397000	Lucas will you stand and sit down for a moment.
1398000	1400000	Jesus.
1400000	1408000	Is that. Can you grab a mic. I really and I really mean can you.
1409000	1413000	So far down. I'm curious. I'm going to get some space. Okay.
1414000	1420000	I'm curious. I'm curious. I talk to people I go for the listeners. We've got a very tall very handsome good. Thank you.
1421000	1426000	Gentlemen it's like he's like a Kiva Shaffer from Lonely Island was like on the mix.
1431000	1440000	So tallness like you don't like like so what is there and don't be afraid to tell the truth no matter what it is like just inside.
1441000	1447000	It's not the same as you saying you should feel sorry for me or anything like that just inside your actual emotions.
1448000	1453000	Do you do you feel hurt when people just like joke about it at all.
1453000	1459000	It's every every single interaction in my entire life is all that only.
1460000	1464000	So is that is that is that troublesome like like it's kind of like you wish.
1465000	1471000	I don't know. I don't know if I can like every single experience since the time I was like five has been shaped by the fact that I'm tall.
1472000	1477000	So I'm just I guess used to it. Do you ever do you ever play that card in a conversation with black people.
1477000	1484000	Oh definitely like in a comment section so it's going. What do you.
1485000	1488000	Marginal eyes matter. That's it. That's that's the most offensive thing.
1489000	1493000	And you're like hey I know what you mean. All right. Yeah. Yeah. You've never been on an airplane.
1494000	1498000	Do you feel compelled to distract from your height. Yes that's why I'm wearing this shirt. I know.
1500000	1505000	Well it might be an excellent tip. We might find out that this takes two inches off the optic nerve.
1506000	1514000	Because it's like by some principle we don't know about that. You've researched you and you and three guys in a club in like London.
1515000	1521000	Well it's like since everyone only talks about how tall I am. It's nice to let them talk about something other than that.
1522000	1528000	That makes sense. Did you go through a big growth spurt like a pain. I have always been very tall.
1528000	1540000	I was 11 pound 7 ounces when I was born. What. Yeah I was six foot in fifth grade. He was such a tall baby. How tall was he.
1541000	1546000	He was such a tall baby that he didn't finish being born until his third birthday.
1549000	1554000	That's great. It's like a Play-Doh fun factory in this motherfucker with this guy.
1555000	1568000	Lucas was such a tall baby. How tall was he. That when he was an infant when he went to Disneyland families agreed to meet around him if they got separated.
1569000	1572000	They actually do. They actually do that. They absolutely do that.
1575000	1582000	Lucas was such a tall baby. How tall was he. There was still snow on him in the summer time.
1585000	1593000	Lucas was such a tall baby. How tall was he. He's not allowed to go to zoos because the giraffes will be insecure.
1594000	1611000	Lucas is such a tall baby. How tall was he. To this day he was the only fetus allowed on roller coasters.
1612000	1619000	I'm not allowed on some. That's not what I was going to say. I bet you aren't allowed on a lot of shit.
1620000	1624000	Then Harry Potter right at Universal they're like you're too tall. You will get your head cut off. That's fucked up.
1625000	1634000	Lucas is so tall that his dick has its own dick and is bigger than your dick.
1634000	1640000	It is proportionate.
1641000	1649000	I love that that's like Lucas's slam. You can so subtly say no it all works together.
1650000	1659000	What do you do. Let's stop doing tall jokes for a few minutes.
1659000	1663000	They use him to change the liberty torch.
1668000	1677000	Lucas do you live in L.A. Are you Los Angelino. I moved here about a year ago. From Oregon. Still on his way too.
1678000	1685000	Were you followed here by your blue ox. Nice. You fucking monster.
1686000	1688000	I'm a human being.
1689000	1694000	Well let's do a segment called the things we should know about Lucas.
1695000	1700000	A segment called we're sorry Lucas. It's okay.
1701000	1708000	Now that he's been gracious about all that. Now his reward should be that we find out some non height related things about him.
1709000	1719000	What band are you in. I'm not in a band. I do paint. You don't play stand up bass. No I play sit down.
1721000	1732000	What do you do. I paint and I'm an actor at Universal Studios. Oh great. What do you do at Universal Studios. I am a character. Now I was once too. What do you do.
1733000	1740000	I'm a few different things. So I'm a I'm a who at Christmas and I also am the warm up act for the animal show if anyone has been there. Yeah.
1741000	1750000	Harpo Marx. It's like a silent clown type. I do a lot of mime and mess with guests. Now I for a summer or two did I was Harry from Harry and the Hendersons and Frankenstein.
1751000	1762000	That's good. Yeah. But yeah. Now this is not a height thing but you would be like you would be too tall. I am. I am too tall. The tallest character of the park is Megatron and height cap is six six.
1763000	1778000	So I'm allowed to be the atmosphere characters are just like you're a policeman. You can I can do that because I was Harry and the Hendersons and the dead of summer wearing a yak fur and latex mushroom. Oh man. Yeah mushroom.
1779000	1798000	I feel really bad for the people who are Shrek. Oh my God. It was the hottest thing. You were just pouring sweat. But inside the big feet of the Bigfoot of the Sasquatch there was like metal high heels in it. So I'm six four ish. I've just like a shade under six four. So in that short head I was like like probably six ten.
1799000	1806000	I got one day I got to play Frankenstein which is the best because you just wear a nice suit. Yeah. Nice suit and like platform heels. Yeah. Yeah.
1807000	1817000	And also nobody fucks with you when you're. Oh definitely not. Yeah. And they bone out. Someone stuck a wand in the mommy's butt.
1820000	1833000	That seems like an awesome 80s Gary Newman song. All right. I got my wand inside inside the mommy's but I like my wrappings.
1834000	1847000	I like my stick. When I when I was Harry Harry and Hendersons it was my own eyes that you could see through the mask and the jaw would work. And you're supposed to be kind of a comical like level character animated.
1848000	1859000	It was nobody really screwed with you because you're so big and there's this big latex padded muscle suit. Yeah. And with yak fur and it's a thousand degrees outside and you're dying. You're dying. You're dying.
1860000	1869000	And you're making ten dollars an hour the fucking hard way. Wait I think you meant Randy Newman didn't you. I was doing Gary Newman. Did you mean Randy Newman. Gary Newman.
1870000	1880000	Okay. Because there's so much someone stick us. Someone put a stick in the mommy's but does it sound more like a Randy Newman. Let's hear Randy Newman talk about putting a wand up.
1880000	1889000	You got that stick now don't you little boy. What you gonna do with that stick when you don't know what to do. You got a stick in your butt.
1892000	1909000	Tall people. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. But it was the Japanese businessmen would come up and they would blow smoke into my mask. They could see human beings eyes in there and they were like getting their tippy toes and go.
1910000	1923000	And then a couple of times just take their hand and try to ram it up Sasquatch's butt. And I would just shove them as hard as I could and then run off like I was being a bad Sasquatch.
1923000	1944000	I've told the story before. I was a Captain Crunch during either their peak popularity as a serial or the valley. I don't know what would make them. This is at the short lived General Mills serial theme park.
1945000	1963000	The promotional campaign was who's the real captain. There were multiple captains wandering the city of Milwaukee. There was another tour and and one of the other. You're not joking. No. I thought this was a bit. All right. I told I told this story. But you've you've also you talked about being Harry in the Henderson. So it's recycling night at harm in town.
1963000	1980000	I was a captain and there was another guy who was a captain because we were multiple captains. We'd go around going I'm the real captain. No I am the real captain. And we had the big costumes with the the the spray painted mesh mouth where you're looking out of it.
1980000	1991000	We went to Winterfest and they put ice skates on us and they said why don't you go out there. No. And the kids were like there's six foot pillows on ice skates. Let's attack.
1991000	2012000	My childhood is incumbent upon me. It's my patriotic duty to ram these fuckers into oblivion. Throw them down and watch the turtles. What did they want to happen. They were just like it was just like it was I don't if you survived Pearl Harbor. I don't know why you think I'm trivializing your experience. But it was to me it was my Pearl Harbor.
2012000	2036000	I remember when you told me that story and I for some reason I was so impressed. But it's impressive. I was Captain Crunch. Yeah. Yeah. It's fucking impressive. So you skated. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like that's hard skating skating. Well when you're in Milwaukee it's like you you you're sliding everywhere anyway. And so that somebody's like put these blades on you'll go faster.
2036000	2054000	Like okay. So Lucas right now you're crazy. I just got to finish the story. Oh sorry. So one of the kids kept bombarding us and I one of the captains my friend I saw who was near him and he grabbed one of the kids.
2054000	2081000	And the mouth is like right in front of the kid's face. And he said if you skate into me one more time I will break your fucking arm. And if you tell anybody I said this I'll deny it. And I think he was the real captain. That's when I figured it out. I don't know if they ever gave us an answer but. That might that might have been Admiral Crunch.
2081000	2110000	All right. So now continue. So you're currently still doing costume work like character stuff up at universe. Yes. Currently we're preparing for Grinchmas. Grinchmas. Grinchmas. Copyright problems there. Can't just. Yeah. Christmas is completely taken. No it's because we don't want a Trump thing. We don't want to say what happened. We don't want to say Christmas. We don't want to say Hanukkah. So it's it's Grinchmas. Yeah. But we sing Christmas girls. Did they still do the Westworld. Waterworld. Waterworld. Yes. Waterworld. I know.
2111000	2138000	Still happening. Still there. It's good. Waterworld. Waterworld. Very very beautiful movie. Very successful ride. And I'll tell you something. I heard what you just said. You're going to be saying Christmas. They're going to be saying Christmas. They're going to love it. They're going to love it. We're going to go down there. We're going to make them say Christmas. Hugely.
2138000	2168000	So tall. Tall. But more to it than that. Ironically working in a theme park the height doesn't figure in. The guy playing Megatron and Harry from Harry and the Hendersons. When you walk by wearing an ill fitting bellhop costume they go what's with the tall guy. You're too tall to be the tall character. I'm too tall to be the tall characters. I can be the other atmosphere. I can be a police officer. British
2168000	2196000	palace guard. Train conductor. Like those ones. Right. But you can't put on the Frankenstein. But they're like shaggy 6-2. And you're like he's a cartoon. Do you have a big dick. I already mentioned this. I said it was proportionate. OK. I don't want to say things out loud. OK. Like that. He said he has a proportionate to my height. Yeah. Well that's OK. Big dick then. Sure.
2199000	2224000	Because mine is not proportionate. How not proportionate is it. Legally I'm required to call it a nipple. Dan's dick is so not proportionate to his size. How not proportionate is it. There's never snow on it.
2225000	2247000	Call back. No one ever agrees to meet in front of it if they go. My dick is so not proportionate to my size. How not proportionate is it. To this day I still don't know if I'm circumcised. Because just the regular amount of skin.
2247000	2275000	Still turtlenecks around it and comes to a little bronze swagger. No. Dan's. Go ahead. Aaron you might be something of an expert on this topic. Dan's dick is so not proportionate to his size. How not proportionate is it.
2275000	2303000	I feel uncomfortable joking about it. I love you. It's beautiful. How beautiful is it. It's so beautiful that it needs to be beautiful. I don't know. Sorry. I just wanted to get in on the on the boy fun.
2303000	2311000	Yeah I know. My dick is so beautiful. How beautiful is it. It's in the background of three Terrence Malick movies.
2311000	2339000	Lucas you said that you're also not just an actor but what else. I also paint. You paint. What sort of painting do you do. Mostly scenes from video games. What media.
2339000	2366000	What media acrylic on canvas. Really. Scenes from. So like pixel paintings. I recently did a painting of Pallet Town from Pokemon if people play Pokemon. So I like draw a grid on the canvas and then I paint it by hand with. He tried doing landscapes like traditional stuff but the teacher would be like that's just a plane. I told you. I told you look out the window. Oh.
2366000	2395000	Oh. Why is it that we think it's okay to comment about this and it's the only physical thing you can. Well I was gonna say like if a we had we had our friend Colin on here he's a little person the dwarfism like we obviously we don't feel quite as we range in our like oh if they make it okay for us we can ask them questions about about the latitude and the effect and all the things.
2395000	2408000	But what is it about height. That's like because it doesn't really. You can't kill a mammoth any better than anybody else. Definitely not. Well somebody must be something that we feel like oh you know you're you're he's fine he's fine like we must be feeling that or we wouldn't feel okay.
2408000	2422000	Like like is it. Are you faster. Are you. Definitely not. I feel like your your heart's probably like you know dying. It's a good. There's probably risk involved. There aren't a lot of tall old people really because of heart attacks.
2422000	2449000	See. That was sad. Look it's like being like just shy of six four. I'm at the threshold of I can just fit into most like roller coasters. Yeah. I can sit and coach without being miserable. Right. But right at the edge of that. So like coach for you is probably a bummer. It is a bummer. If you get southwest and you board early you can get the exit row. Yeah. But you have to. Yeah. You got to. What about roller coasters.
2449000	2450000	Coasters. Yeah. I love roller coasters. I'm wedged into most roller coasters. Oh yeah. I mean I just don't go on. I just don't bother because it's like it's because like if I wait in line for an hour to get on the coaster and then they're like you can't go on. And I'm like oh great. And the goddamn nightmare of any theatrical situation at all. Even me. I'm aware you know I'm six feet like like like it's like that that dread of like you walk into a
2479000	2509000	station already filled auditorium or picnics outdoor like thing where people are sitting or something. And it's just that those comments like oh god no. Yeah. I know. I apologize to this lovely gentleman behind me. I was like I'm sorry but I am the guy who's running to is an African-American gentleman. So and how happy are you right now that he's on stage and not sitting in front of you. Yeah.
2509000	2538980	I have tall guy guilt about going to concerts and stuff like I stand in the back. Yeah. I have that guilt but it doesn't hold me back from living my life. I love it. I mean you're still you're still a white man. Oh I know. Hey Lucas Lucas if we do you have like an Instagram or something like that we can follow your art and I like people to buy something. I guess I do have an Instagram.
2539400	2559860	King Lucas Lee on Instagram. I don't know how to Instagram King Lucas L. E. L. E. Yeah. Oh yeah. Let's check it out. Maybe we'll get one and like hang out on the wall here for our harmonies. Lovely. I'll I'll pay you one for free and bring it next time. All right. All right. Your free ride is over. He's coming back down. Let's hear from Lucas everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
2559860	2589860	Oh you can still see me. And it's all about this. This view. But as I. That is interesting. I don't want to. I don't want to. But that is it. I told it. That didn't even as the last thought I had was like oh yeah. Women like like like like you like. It's the last thing I think of before I know house keys. Women like if you if you're like a six foot seven woman you're going to
2589860	2619860	you probably you're an experience a completely different thing. It's not like tall person short person. It's like there's an additional layer of like of course. Yeah. I want I wanted to ask Lucas and you could nod yes or no. But I was curious if like if people I was thinking about that exact same thing like if he was female women like a very tall woman may worry about whether or not men are fetishizing their tallness like they have a crumb fetish. You told me on one of our first dates that you you know like you you have to wonder whether the the the like a
2619860	2649860	lot of guys ask you out. But you're always wondering if they just want to claim you. Yeah. Yeah. Like I have. I mean less so now. Well I don't know. Like from time to time I've had it. I've had a crumb body like big thighs and I feel weird describing my body. And you were speaking from a place of of tallness. Well and also that that like I think you were referring possibly to the phenomenon of like small gentlemen of a smaller stature seeming to have a
2649860	2679860	proclivity. Yes. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. Yes. Which is a weird which is a weird line across if you're attracted to somebody and then you're like well is it am I a fetish for them. Do you Lucas do you experience this. Sometimes yes. No no for you. Like do you ever do you ever have any. Can you tell when someone's like oh this is this is a tall chaser. This is a building chaser. I don't date much because people don't see me as a person a lot.
2679860	2709860	Yeah. Oh man. Not after tonight Lucas. Now you're going to have to worry about whether they're star fuckers. And after the election I was like OK no more lines I'm not going to celebrate like these demographic lines and stuff but it is still fun to talk about like the it is because I am convinced appearing in my own head and talking to other guys like we're kind of
2709860	2739860	oblivious to the to that thing of like I guess unless it's like money like guys get money like oh they're a gold digger gold digger. But like anything else if a guy if a woman was like yeah I'm only going out with you because your feet are shaped like skis or where the guy would be like all right great it paid off like. But I think I think I think yeah I don't know. There might be a disparity there but then I think about it I'm like yeah probably not. Like I think you'd evenly dispersed like men and women who would either have a problem with that or not.
2739860	2769860	I have a problem with that probably. Yeah I think as long as it's like consensual and not secret like that's cool as long as someone's not hiding their their deep. I don't know. Yeah. As long as they don't they like the person as well. Well what if somebody was going out with you and they said like oh I just love how you're I don't know they said something really specific physically about you and it was like something that felt temporary. What if they said you know it's like isn't that the thing that's always being people suspect is not being said. Like like the like oh I think
2769860	2799860	he might like me. He talks about my how hot my body like red hair red hairs red hair. You can buy in a bottle. You get it doesn't. I'm talking about the terror of like oh my boyfriend loves my ass. He loves my he's always talking about my ass. Like well he's like he's not just talking about its existence. He might be talking about its state of being at that particular time. That must be fucking horrible. I have to find my own shame before I
2799860	2829860	worry about like my my my body and that that takes a long time. And then I look really bad. Okay. I'm just like I have to like have difficulty breathing in my sleep before I'm like I should lose some weight. Or I'll see myself from 90 degrees like profile in a Facebook live video talking about Trump getting elected. And I'll be like this just looks like a mountain of of of of leaves.
2829860	2856740	It's a shambling mound. Squirrels hiding things in him. But I don't do anything about it. I got an elliptical in my living room and it's just literally like sitting there since the day it was assembled just waiting just going what did I do. Have you ever used it. I've literally have not used it. How long has it been there. I don't know man. Steve how long has it been there. How long has the elliptical been there. How long is the elliptical been there.
2859860	2884460	Seven months. How long since you also found a laptop holder so I could play Minecraft while I was on the elliptical thinking that might get me on it. I think I bought that before the elliptical. Yeah. It's all set up and ready to go. I bought you a tracksuit. That was part of the whole.
2884460	2914440	I want to know more about this tracksuit. What color is it. Wait Jeff tell you get get up there. No I did not. That's awesome. He just stormed the stage. Flavor flames. All right. Well I mean maybe as a as a as a loving audience that we could all help you get on the elliptical.
2914460	2933340	There's a there's a fine line between that and fatty fatty two by four. Like a bunch of people chanting you need exercise is like. It's not about it's not about your weight. It's just like it's like a healthy thing to do. You know it's like I think. Is it true that you can't make it through the cellar door.
2933340	2960860	I got I've got I've got the tracksuit was the final thing. I was like I don't have an outfit. Yeah. Am I supposed to. They're going to see me with my dick coming out through my holy underwear and my asshole. They're going to see me in this weird like. Is that the pesh mode exercising. Is there a. When we do raps when you do kicky baby dance like that. That's like being on the elliptical. It's certainly the exercise I currently get. Yeah.
2961860	2975300	Yeah. Or if I tell a story where I'm especially vexed by election results that after I do this and then like 10 minutes later you'll be talking I'll be like why don't why don't my body thinks I was swimming.
2976620	2987940	Steve and Aaron and Spencer and I like this thing start coming up with long like 20 minute the kind of medium tempo rap beats where you have to do the kicky baby dance the whole time and then.
2987940	3015740	I think if everyone was just chanting about how adorable you were you would exercise a lot while I was exercising. Yeah. If everybody was like if I woke up one morning I was like where's all the attention and then I could hear it coming from downstairs and it was like it was like a video game where a tutorial where I had to get on the elliptical in order to get the attention like it started coming in like an incremental clicker game like like that's how I collected cookies.
3018940	3022940	It's exercise exercise time at Harmon town.
3031940	3032940	We want you alive.
3032940	3042940	When you wake up in the morning and you need to move to take your mother to the basket.
3042940	3044940	Little feet kicking in the air.
3060940	3062940	Don't forget about your adorable elbow.
3063940	3066940	Yeah, little upper body strength.
3068940	3071940	I just smelled his bits. He's not going to do that.
3072940	3076940	Shit came out of his own bits.
3077940	3079940	He hasn't taken a shower in a while.
3080940	3083940	His girlfriend went out of town for a while.
3084940	3088940	He's been playing Deus Ex for a while.
3089940	3092940	That game is pretty hard on the medium difficulty.
3094940	3102940	Can you feet baby feet now knees up now knees up knees in the air and now elbows to the side.
3103940	3116940	Now elbows nice and wide now knees up once again count to 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 but dance while you're counting.
3117940	3121940	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 again.
3123940	3125940	You just burned four calories.
3125940	3147940	What that song reminds me of is my own mortality.
3147940	3158940	I will I will I will I will make whatever I just burnt off back by I'll just lick something back there.
3159940	3164940	Like I have ways of scrounging for calories that people don't even know about.
3165940	3167940	I find truffles. I just find truffles.
3168940	3172940	People don't know that Dan makes most of his money by being a truffle finder.
3177940	3181940	We just did a joke about Dan exercise. We're like no no I will not say pig couldn't ever.
3182940	3185940	Was that that. That was you. Not me.
3187940	3191940	All right. Well you're not going to get divorced twice.
3195940	3202940	There are people people here that want to present you with this thing that you tangentially.
3203940	3209940	Well I don't come out our friends from from carrot top carrot carrot carrot.
3210940	3214940	Carrot top. Carrot top from carrot.
3217940	3220940	Thank you Steve. What's up Dan. My name is Anthony and this is Claire.
3221940	3223940	We've never met but we've worked together before.
3226940	3228940	We work for a company called carrot creative.
3229940	3234940	I'm familiar. Yeah. You guys do all this great stuff for Adult Swim like your wizards of marketing wizards of marketing.
3235940	3238940	Put that on my tombstone. So that would be good marketing.
3241940	3247940	You're very dedicated. It takes a strong marketer to volunteer his tombstone space.
3249940	3252940	I'll just be vaporized into the ground. I'm not going to be have the benefit of a tombstone.
3253940	3256940	Anyways pass the savings onto a larger tombstone. Yeah there you go.
3257940	3261940	I'm going to. I'm not even going to die. I'm just going to get lost like an elf in Middle Earth.
3262940	3265940	But I'm still I still want that fucking big ass tombstone. Yeah there you go.
3266940	3269940	So the first project we ever did together was something called the Rick and Morty Rixtaverse.
3270940	3275940	Has anybody ever heard of that Instagram account that you can waste a lot of time on.
3276940	3281940	And we actually won an award for it from canned lions from canned France.
3281940	3285940	It's an international award. So it's not it's not an Emmy. It's not the Emmy you're getting yet.
3286940	3294940	But we have a canned lion for you. This is your award. This is for you and Justin and for everybody at Starburns.
3295940	3300940	It's working on Rick and Morty really hard. It's like I said it's not an Emmy but it's heavy as hell and it's made out of real bronze.
3301940	3308940	You were saying it's like the Academy Awards for advertising right. Yeah as lame as that sounds. But it's still a big deal.
3309940	3310940	Jesus.
3315940	3320940	But why do I get one. I didn't do the commercials. Well I mean you had to approve everything.
3323940	3329940	You get an award for approving things. You're part of the team. You gave. I remember a comic con a couple of years ago.
3330940	3337940	You gave extensive notes. We had no extensive notes of that thing. This guy's had it on lock man. I don't deserve this.
3338940	3341940	I'm going to give this to to clinically tall people.
3344940	3350940	Accept your award with grace. Oh I'm sorry. I didn't. Well OK. All right. That was my Wisconsin thing. Yeah.
3351940	3355940	Shouldn't deflect a compliment. But at the same time I just want to. Yeah. Thank you so much. That was that. This is.
3356940	3360940	This is so nice that you would think of me and give this to me. Thank you. I'm just saying the system is fucked.
3360940	3367940	Well yeah. But I mean it is for you that we can do things like this because any that any other show creator to be like.
3369940	3375940	But like it was because you guys and because you're passionate we get to keep doing it. We've done two different expansions for it.
3375940	3381940	There might be some more coming up. We can't technically say but sounds like you know more coming up. So I mean there's more.
3382940	3386940	And when is season three coming out. What's going on. I was going to ask you to say.
3387940	3391940	Oh shit. Seems to be taking a while. It's just drawings. I think you can.
3393940	3402940	Why did you make a Facebook post just make season three. Yeah. Yeah. I'm tweeting like oh yeah we elected a Nazi. Hey just shut up get back to work on season three.
3402940	3409940	I said they're drawing it. I don't want it. Why don't you just start approving things faster Dan.
3410940	3417940	Maybe that is that is what my approval usually gets on the way. It was a it took stealth approval to finally make me nail it.
3417940	3419940	I should just let people do what they're what they're already doing.
3423940	3426940	It's real fun to kiss. I can't say that.
3429940	3436940	It's not a Cleo but oh it's better than a Cleo. It's so much. This is international man. Yeah. Yeah. That's like more than one country.
3436940	3442940	Yep. It's like a beautiful sexy sleepy lion. What is it about like like what's your what.
3443940	3459940	I talked to a lot of marketing people and at the risk of offending any of the ones that have worked with me on anything like because I don't talk to a lot of good ones like I like like like like you guys are clearly like you're on your shit like like it.
3460940	3473940	You're thinking about this stuff and it's like like what is it. What is the what do I want to ask here. So I want to I want to ask a question that the answer can like get through to like young people that want to go into marketing or young people that shouldn't go into marketing.
3473940	3487940	We should hear it and go oh that's not me. I should be a cowboy. What is it. What is the at its highest art. You know like what is the there's something fancy to say about you know like the guy in chariots a fire goes.
3488940	3505940	When I run I feel God's pleasure. So you can't use that. What is it about marketing. What is it. I don't know what I'm trying to ask. Just say something 9 11. It's not OK. I thought that's what I thought that was about 10 percent 9 11. That's right. Everything is. Let's face it.
3506940	3523940	You know but like I don't know you're just kind of take over for me. Do good. I mean it's this is kind of a hard question to answer for this specific thing. What Dan's asking you guys is to market marketing. Yeah. Yes. Sell us on being in marketing. Think outside the box.
3523940	3552940	Well something like this. It's hard for me to even say it because it's for something so specific like Rick and Morty that we were all passionate about and huge fans of before we were even like twinkles and adult swims. I you know what I mean. I was such a just a huge fan of everything and just you know I remember my buddy my running into my dorm room talking about you got to see this thing and it was heat vision and Jack and like all this other channel one on one stuff. So it's just the fact that I'm able to work on something that that I love so much. It's that's part of it. So what about you.
3553940	3577940	I'm able to get to work on something that you love like I work on a lot of like Facebook ads for credit cards to get to Rick and Morty. So I guess what I could say is like one part of it is giving a shit and then part of it is like working your way towards you to get to something that you just love and you're able to work on it because you're not going to get it right away. You might not get it for a long time. It took me a long time. Unlike Claire who we hired just for the Ricks first. So this was her her first job out of school.
3577940	3604940	I'm a brat. Sorry. Claire was at your pitch or did you pitch using Instagram that way. That very individual. It was like 10,000 percent a team effort. And I actually at the very beginning wasn't even brought on until like halfway through production when we realized like oh shit we still have a lot to do and this is launching in a month or whatever. Carrot tells other female employees to say that it was her idea. She's.
3605940	3619940	Anthony and Claire you came at a pretty propitious moment because speaking of marketing. Dan and I are marketing a whole new line of workout tapes. It's called the baby Kiki dance. You guys got to get up there and do it.
3619940	3646940	I don't know. I don't understand. First you lift your award up to the sky. You raise it up with your right hand high. Then you go down to the left side. Lift it up on the left side past battle. I can't. I don't think it's Dan. You're acting like you don't want to sell these workout tapes. I can't.
3647940	3673940	I couldn't. I couldn't hear you. I was being. I think you were saying bend over and pick something up off the floor and exercise deal breaker because I'm going to have another workout tape called learn how to listen. I can't hear. I'd learn how to hear. I got my ears are dying along with the rest of my body. How old are you guys. You guys dying. Definitely. You feel it in your brain.
3673940	3694940	Technically dying. To quote Duncan Trussell. God is a murderer. But are you starting to forget actors names. Like you're just trying to riff. You're like. And then you take 10 minutes ago. Ray Don Chong. It's more that I'll see things online or like bands and like Saturday Night Live. Better on Saturday. I'm like I don't know who that is. I don't care. Well yeah. Okay. That's a good question.
3703940	3731940	That's emotionally dying. Yeah. Well that's curmudgeonry. That's it. That's those are the beginning stages where you're just like oh I already did this. That was called in excess. And then you're like like I don't know. I already saw a Spider Man movie for God's sakes. But then you slowly then you start to go like I don't even know what I'm doing. And then you go to a Marvel movie and you're like that was great. And they're like you already saw that. You wrote part of it. And I'm like me and Stan Lee are just like all right great Excelsior.
3734940	3762940	I'm acting like I know I'm just fine. I really did. By the way I really didn't. I really did not write it. People are tweeting me and going like being humble. He wrote the whole thing. There were parts that have felt like it was you. I know. But that's the thing. Like if you could think about anybody and I just really like I'm a writer and I don't. My worst neighbor would be those the people that worked hard on that movie. The writers hearing that they like I did not. There's like a couple words till the Swinton says when she's showing him the mirror dimension or something.
3763940	3784940	That I think accidentally got in there from like a bad version of a scene I wrote. Like I didn't. I didn't. I just talked to them about about portals and stuff for a little bit. But let me ask you this. Let me. And they had already shot like most of the movie when I talked to them about portals. So I'm not even saying I gave them the idea for portals. I'm saying like I was just like yeah portals are neat. And they're like yeah they're like holes. But doors and I was like yeah you got it.
3785940	3809940	But let me ask you this because it's something that I'm sort of on the other side now for once because of this project like the fact that you got to touch the Doctor Strange movie you got to say things that write things that till this went and said like does that still make you something inside more than ever. Especially the more I think the longer you've worked I guess maybe you get desensitized if you if you if you wrote for I don't know like I don't know if you were like super duper.
3809940	3838940	I guess if you were Josh Wheaton and then somebody was like hey Bob Denver from Gilligan's Island wants you to write a commercial for him and I guess maybe you would be less than starstruck. No offense to a probably dead Bob Denver but I just I just I but but but there's no way like at 43 it was like it was more like it was like in those biopics when the when like the shitty like you know like weird character that can't get a break.
3839940	3866940	Or that like spends his life like saying we should go corn on the moon or something like and then it's like it was like a it was like a trying it was great because it was like yeah no I don't even know how to yeah of course it was amazing because I thought of it was I mean that's what this was to me the fact that I was able to sort of touch Rick and more to be able to write in this voice and be able to write these comics to be able to name like an alien I'm like hey does this alien have a name no can we call it this sure like I got to name the alien.
3866940	3875940	Yeah like something like that is somebody who like not just like a person but a creative person because Dan Dan did you approve that name.
3875940	3890940	Somebody did. Here's the thing that's really noteworthy like that that's all that stuff for that rich diverse all of the stone I assume that they generally are using you guys for all the stuff that I'm always noticing I'm going like wait some some person like just they just made that up.
3890940	3911940	But it kind of falls in line with with everything like it never violates the it's not about violating the cannon as much as it is violating the violate back cannon marketing marketing.
3911940	3937940	That can that cannon does the violating it it's it's it's violating that though the worry would be violating the tone the the the tonal IQ or something like that like oh this isn't worthy of you know it's like oh this is like a hacky joke like someone's just connecting a dot because oh that guy's a pencil vester so of course they made pen Stephanie or something like that where you're just like well that's not the no just don't don't do that.
3938940	3960940	To the code what's that we keep to the code yeah like and that's that's not easy when the code isn't just linear dot connection you know when it's not like oh now you play like it's like collaboration you guys like fill in with you're just you're keeping with the actual like tone of the it's very impressive that shouldn't be that shouldn't be overlooked and obviously some French people didn't overlook it.
3960940	3990940	Claire and Anthony Anthony right yes what's like can you give us like is there any like dirty underbelly of marketing like kind of Mad Men stuff that goes on like like what goes on in marketing well specifically for the can line it's always a big deal because it's the international stage that there's just it started people show their true colors there's a woman out there called Cindy Gallop that you should follow because she's like I don't know what she specifically done but she is like the like badass woman in the advertising industry and she's exposing people so like with the can lines there's a number of different
3990940	4020940	awards a lot of it because we went for the entertainment lines which is pretty cool because it's all like entertainment that's what everybody's all excited about but I mean everything billboards print ads email marketing they all have Lions categories and especially like the print ads there's always there's like ways to get in it there's you know all you gotta do is you gotta run your ad one time in one random magazine in one random country in order for it to be approved and you can qualify for line and then some of these things win because it's always like crazy provocative stuff and there
4020940	4050940	was one for some headache brand it was for like their PM product and I can't I'm paraphrasing here but essentially the concept was give your wife this drowsy making headache product and then you can have sex with her while she's passed out and they gave that an award I think I right I think it was a jello pudding pops commercial right so so that guy like all these people that are looking like oh that's funny check it off check it off and
4050940	4080940	so it's one thing that they're like the judges aren't necessarily look into like well is this real how where did this run is this was this actually approved it's just those be like and then the write-off so not only is it offensive that won this fake thing won an award but it's also in a way it's offensive that these guys just sort of looked at the the the creative concept which was rape and you're like yep and then just checked it off so I mean and what Cindy's doing and like just pointing people out putting everybody tasked with me to task any mail and advertising the task as we
4080940	4110940	should be especially now it's just like hey this is kind of fucked up that we think this is funny so there's things like that and just there was another one that was like a fake app it was this it was in this one of the same categories that the Rix first was also up for which we didn't win but this fake app one because it was it was pulling cashed images of Google Earth in like the Metagrading see it's like oh you can spot refugees and if you spot one press this button and we'll let somebody know about it but it was fake like it didn't work they launched it like a week before
4110940	4140940	the ads actually went up and the actual app didn't even work sad what were they what was it was it was it Levi's or what was the I think it was actually a charity oh so it was actually just it was it wasn't even like oh this was a well-intended but ill-conceived like ad for for a Snickers bar like it was like it was just like con artistry I yeah I mean it's well yeah I've always felt like I'm not
4140940	4170940	qualified to actually say this but I've always always had the suspicion until we went to white nationalism with this last election like I always had the suspicion that that we had our thing going on over here that we were like the Las Vegas of Earth that we got this open book that we are dwelling among the the legacy of the promises we made and dealing with the fallout with our free press and our and and you know having invented television and then inventing the culture that was based on it having diverted from monarchy and any
4170940	4200940	pre-existing class system into a pure like crazy ass well-intended but totally fucking like out of control capitalistic class system that we were over here kind of like working all this shit out and everybody in Europe is like like holding their pinky out with a drink their tea and going like yeah fuck those guys so racist so sexist so out of control so stupid such gun nuts all this stuff but that then every once in a while on Facebook you see this thing that's like look at this
4200940	4230940	detergent ad that this country just did and it's like a woman puts a Chinese guy in a washing machine and because she uses their detergent he comes out as a big black guy and fucks her brains out yep and that won an award and won that same not the exact same award but they have a very similar statue and it's kind of like like like and then you and then you saw I also saw cuz I clicked on that thing and I was like oh wait it was also a derivation of a different version of the same ad where it was also kind of like slight racial components compared to like how color is good protect your color anyways like I
4230940	4260940	it's like like I think I think a lot of shit over there is like in the catacombs and like like like not bubbled up yet like like that they're not ready at all and now I'm just in a full-blown panic because it's like I thought my consolation was always that we were we were the clumsy nutcases that we came over here like it's this weird like witch burning colony where we're like let's work that out and then we're like and then we're like oh the people in Africa look different let's work that out and it's like let's build it it's like everything we ever did was just like foot into
4260940	4290940	mouth head-up ass like like burning both get the candles of being a jackass at both ends and like while everyone watched and was like we know how to do it better because we still have a crown in a case somewhere in a museum but now I'm just now I'm just fucking terrified because obviously we went that it wasn't the story that's not what was happening we were we we for 200 years all we did was just rebuild our own little ad hoc kind of fucking like little like fucking
4290940	4320940	shitty little congratulations on the award yeah I mean that was the weirdest acceptance speech I've ever heard never thanked you if you were hired to sell America but your demographic was not Trump supporters he figured out how to sell America to you know a certain kind of customer and turned out that was the strategy that worked with the electoral system and blah blah blah if you
4320940	4350940	were if your job was just to sell our country post-election like you know like Chipotle probably had somebody come in okay and that guy said you need to focus on salsa yeah any ideas not to put you on the spot like where would you start you'd like you gotta so who are we selling America to we're selling it so let's say Martians like I don't know like like but but they can distinguish between countries they're going like we're gonna we're gonna destroy
4350940	4380940	earth but we're gonna leave one country left let's try that like like show me what you got the Martians the Martians are going there's 250 countries all right you guys just you guys fucked up like Mars is like we have because we have less oceans because we just started speaking Martian and so like we you guys need to clean this so your your job America sent you
4380940	4410940	as the marketing guy to the up front so the first thing we're probably in in competition with let's say the bigger countries nothing against like all these like nothing against Denmark yeah they're not gonna offer anything to Mars is to be us China and Russia what do we got we got some pretty kick-ass mountain it also depends on what they're gonna be using America for like we've got some pretty we've got some halfway decent infrastructure like the internet sucks balls but other than that like we've got some pretty
4410940	4440940	good high waves some pretty solid highways that's how would I would have started I would have started with jazz and rock and roll and well that's the other things we have to know before we can sell America we gotta know about the Martians what are they looking for are they looking for like pure natural resources well I should load oil in Texas this weekend hear about that they shouldn't I can't believe they didn't start looking for it there that's where I go for all
4440940	4470940	my oil probably post oil at this point I well I did think yeah you're right I didn't specify but I think it's interesting that you that was attacked attack that I didn't even think about it first of all you you're very practical the entire time the first thing you did is sweep 273 nations off the table it's only this is my country too you know I got it and then and then you see a lot of chief burgers you guys can see he's saying Denmark right off the bat and told everybody but China and Russia to go fuck themselves that's very smart
4470940	4500940	now it's a three-person race this is my 2020 bit starting right now Claire how would you go about pitching America under a Trump presidency to to an alien race oh Jesus well can I first I'll give you time to think while I refine because I think that's a good question to ask me and my it's like the Martian the Martians no no no I mean his question to me about refining the question I'm not hijacking your question sure you
4500940	4530940	love to watch me be a bad person and you just say he's being a bad person it's like you're projecting it a little bit but I'm not a bad person I'm just saying like I'm helping her by saying like okay here's what the Martians I'll answer that here's what the Martians are looking for the Martians are looking for they want to they want earth to they want it to they want to they want to plug and play they want to like walk away from it they want to they get
4530940	4560940	to use their bombs or whatever Martian rays to wipe out all but one country thinking that that country will then be the only country on this place called earth and their goal is they're looking for the country that represents the best of what the human species has to offer intergalactically there take it so I would definitely take them to in and out first there you go yeah take them out to a nice lunch show them a burger exactly
4560940	4590940	right um I mean if we're looking at like if they want to keep say earth is gonna be like this sort of zoo not sue that's gonna be awful that's gonna be an awful way to get into it but no it's not gonna be a zoo it's gonna have to it's gonna have to trade with them I'm inside they're looking for a collaborator otherwise it just blows up and put like a they put a Martian in and out there but they they they're saying like well you guys are you're you're you're you're you're blocked you're arguing with each other you can't agree you've got some people thinking that you should put a tarp on your
4590940	4620940	on the female half and you've got other people thinking that cars are more important than bullets and bullets are more important than feet like like you can't figure out your value system you don't have any kind of you need to get into the Star Trek mode of like each planet has a gimmick each gimmick is like we like war we like logic we like the color green like like all we're hearing when we listen to earth is a bunch of static we're looking for the country that's gonna like you know next we're gonna we're gonna blow everybody else up let the one country repopulate so it's like their language
4620940	4650940	their culture their you know their history will become you know their their curation of the previous history before everyone got blown up like all of that shit next time we come back around those people that country will be the planet and so who's it gonna be why should it be America I think it's because we have the raw tools to do it if you look at America compared to everybody else and I know considering this election was one because of a like from the help of a white nationalist movement I think of what sets America great is
4650940	4680940	our capacity for diversity that we can like point at I know but we can point yes if the if the aliens were going to have like dinner party meetings with every nation who would you invite what Americans would you be like oh I'm gonna have these celebrities and we're gonna serve this and the music's gonna be this you know you do you just have the aliens when I would punt to my producer you you you for me you just say aliens we're gonna we're gonna sit down we're all gonna go to
4680940	4710940	dantanas and you're gonna meet you're gonna meet Aerosmith and they're just gonna tell you some fucking awesome rock and roll stories and then you get them real high and then you steal their resources well I guess if it's just like a face-to-face meeting I would probably hire more character actors than anything who's the guy with the big mustache from big Dennis Farina Sam Elliott
4710940	4740920	yeah I wonder I wonder what a commercial by Sam Elliott for earth would sound like I'm Sam Elliott for earth it's not what's for dinner we're not a steak we're a planet but America is the potatoes on that plate because marketing research has proved that you eat the potato for
4740920	4770920	first and then Sam Elliott just stabs everybody I would say to them I guess given my criteria I would say but you would do it as Rosie Perez right no I wouldn't I would say to them like well look we've been trying to do what you're talking about for a long time like blowing everybody else up and taking their place so like we might not be the best candidate for the
4770920	4800080	job but at least we know what you're talking about when you pick when you pitch it you pick China you might come back and they're just like we love being China and like half the planet just sitting there fucking go it go with America man hello I'm Sam Elliott for America our Chinese food is better than China they eat any fucking thing over there we called it down to the good stuff and then he stabs everybody
