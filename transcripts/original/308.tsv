0	15680	Hello.
15680	17760	Can I get a yup?
17760	18760	Can I get a yup?
18760	19760	Yup.
19760	20760	No, the whole audience.
20760	21760	Give me a yup.
21760	22760	Hello, gang.
22760	45880	All right, it's October 22, 2018 from the Diamond Tap Saltwater.
45880	46880	Here we are.
46880	49760	Welcome to MacArthur Park.
49760	53680	Once again, Harman Town is in session.
53680	57920	Hell yeah, it's good to be back.
57920	58920	I missed you all.
58920	59920	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.
59920	60920	We got that bag.
60920	61920	What you got in that bag?
61920	62920	I don't even know.
62920	74800	Well, I'll tell you what we got backstage, Spencer.
74800	75800	We got a mayor.
75800	76800	His name is Dan Harman.
76800	77800	Oh, damn.
77800	78800	Here we come.
78800	79800	Yo.
79800	80800	Oh, yeah.
80800	81800	Yeah.
81800	82800	Yo.
82800	83800	Yo.
83800	84800	Yo.
84800	85800	Yo.
85800	98480	My raps are tight because they're slow.
98480	106120	When you rap, you have to know the next thing you're going to say.
106120	113360	So my raps will be good today because the beats per minute are 32.
113360	117080	So I always know what I'm going to do.
117080	122720	I said hip hop, hippity hop.
122720	124040	Always rapping.
124040	126200	I never stopped.
126200	129560	The other day, I went outside.
129560	132080	I fucked your mama's pussy.
132080	134560	That's why it's wide.
134560	140560	I looked at her and I said, bread.
140560	141560	Okay.
141560	142560	Thank you.
142560	143560	All right.
143560	144560	Yeah.
144560	153040	It's like I never left.
153040	157200	Just slow it down and you'll be a rap master.
157200	159840	You'll never screw up.
159840	161160	That was flawless.
161160	162880	Thank you for coming.
162880	163880	I'm so excited.
163880	169920	I was just talking to our guest backstage about all of the things between he and I,
169920	172560	like all the things that we were like, yeah, I don't want to talk about that.
172560	173560	Yeah.
173560	174560	I don't want to talk about that.
174560	175560	It's like, what about this thing?
175560	176560	Oh, yeah.
176560	177560	I don't want to talk about that.
177560	178560	Like, all right.
178560	179560	I'll see you out there.
179560	180560	It's funny.
180560	185680	They're just personal things that we're like, it's not juicy stuff.
185680	187400	It wouldn't be fun for you if we talked about it.
187400	189400	It was just a funny conversation to have.
189400	191160	Oh, I don't want to talk about that.
191160	192160	Yeah.
192160	193160	Also, we won't talk about that.
193920	194920	Okay.
194920	197360	I guess you'd have to be there.
197360	206080	Our guest is Brett Cavanaugh.
206080	210480	I get all my news now.
210480	215880	I have one social media outlet, which is my Instagram account.
215880	222120	I get all my news from Dave Klein when I'm doing my like, tummy crunches.
222120	228560	So I know now currently what I know is that I know that Jay-Z and Beyonce have cut it
228560	232240	off with Kanye.
232240	236720	Whatever supply line they had moving between their Fallout 4 settlements, there's no more
236720	239320	line there on that Pip-Boy map.
239320	245640	Have you guys used the Pip-Boy app on the iPad when you're playing Fallout 4?
245640	248640	It's exciting for like 10 seconds.
248640	256400	And then you realize, okay, this is like the weirder version of hitting the B key.
256400	260280	It's exciting for a second because you're like, oh, you can do all the shit on your
260280	261280	iPad.
261280	262280	I applaud that.
262280	263280	I love that.
263280	264280	I like that.
264280	266800	It's better than that Rockstar Games.
266800	271000	You can train your dog if you tap on it, and then when you get back in the game, you get
271000	272680	like a dog turd or something.
272680	277320	There's been a lot of attempts to fuse your handheld devices with your console.
277320	278960	What the hell are you talking about?
278960	282920	Well, that's a legitimate question, but not in that tone of voice.
282920	287680	You don't have a right to be that angry that you don't know what I'm talking about.
287680	288840	Walk me into your world.
288840	289840	I don't know.
289840	292040	Do you expect me to understand anything?
292040	293440	No, I don't expect nothing of you.
293440	294720	I don't expect you to show up.
294720	296840	Where the fuck have you been?
296840	299240	Who are you?
299240	303080	Why are you white again?
303080	304080	I'm the white.
304080	306600	Why are you dressed the same but white?
307480	309480	Why are you guys white now?
309480	311640	I think they chose better when Brandon is here.
311640	312640	I love Brandon.
312640	314120	I miss him already.
314120	316360	I told him to come the night and be there.
316360	317360	He's like, no, man.
317360	321240	Yeah, because he doesn't want to hear these passive aggressive hoots and hollers they
321240	323640	give you when you come back.
323640	325440	You're cheering the bad dad.
325440	330000	How do you think that makes mom feel?
330000	334160	She was here for you all three weeks making soup.
334160	339120	I was on the road waking up early in the morning and watching you bench press.
339120	340120	That's what I fucking did.
340120	341640	Now you're a skinny Dan Harmon.
341640	343360	Where did Dan Harmon come from?
343360	346360	I've been eating a lot of tacos.
346360	351040	I don't have it anymore because I've eaten like two pizzas and I had tacos tonight, but
351040	352160	I had it for a second.
352160	355440	I did take a picture of it, but I didn't Instagram it.
355440	361160	I have like the shadow of a half of an ab, I think, emerging.
361160	363160	Yeah.
363160	366680	You won't see it anymore, but it was like everyone.
366680	367680	I'm getting there.
367680	369080	Can we see it?
369080	372800	You won't see it anymore.
372800	381160	But when I, like somewhere around there, it's like, if you make the images combined from
381160	392320	each eye, oh no, hurry up, hurry.
392320	393320	What are you doing?
393320	394840	Is it, are you writing a check?
394840	395840	He's cross hatching.
395840	396840	All right.
396840	400000	You gave me an abs.
400000	403320	He gave, he gave me an abs.
403320	407360	I don't want to steal your glory or anything, but I was laying in bed this morning and I
407360	413760	looked down and one thing of my, like just one sixth of my stomach looked like, looked
413760	417160	a slight bit defined under the morning light.
417160	419720	And I was like, what is happening?
419720	420720	Is this an ab?
420720	421720	Yeah.
421720	426600	I think it's like, like they said, as abs, they come in, they don't come in one ab.
426600	428480	No, it's like hair on your beard.
428480	430480	You can have a quarter ab.
430480	432480	Yeah.
432480	433880	You can have a one pack.
433880	437880	And also it makes sense that when you're on the verge of getting a quarter ab, that it's
437880	442440	going to be like poking its head out like a turtle, like, it'll be there and then gone.
442440	446840	I'm sure you didn't see one when I lifted my shirt up because I don't see it every,
446840	447840	every time.
447840	448840	Right.
448840	453200	It's going to be like, it's going to keep the frequency with which you can see it will
453200	454200	continue.
454200	455200	It'll increase.
455200	458480	And by 2023, I'm going to, I've revised my goals.
458480	460760	I'm not going to look like Chris Pratt by January.
460760	462320	That's not happening.
462320	466160	I'm convinced that there's CG and steroids involved in that process and then I won't,
466160	467160	I won't touch.
467160	468160	I'm not high roading them.
468160	477800	I just think that it's, it's a lie and, but my new goal is original captain Kirk back
477800	478800	in the day.
478800	479800	Nice.
479800	484360	When you could just, they're kind of, they're all chested.
484360	492560	Kilgirard, Buck Rogers, like when, when, when a man would take his shirt off if he was the
492560	496200	lead in a show, but he could just, he could just have the torso, it looked like a can
496200	497200	of soup.
497200	502960	Just was like, it just looked like a cylinder and that was considered being fit.
503960	507800	The absence of anything flowing over the belt was okay.
507800	511760	And also they would just wear these big belts, like what they, they'd take their shirt off
511760	516320	because like the insect queen would, I demand a gladiator for my satisfaction.
516320	524000	And then the gladiator outfit would conveniently involve a belt the size of a shirt.
524000	526120	Who is that handsome specimen?
526120	527600	He is an earth man.
527600	528600	Impressive.
528600	529600	Yes.
530600	535560	You guys don't know how to get down?
535560	536560	Get down?
536560	539440	I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
539440	542640	This is the 25th century.
542640	549520	Get down, Buck Rogers.
549520	550520	We've discussed this before.
550520	556080	If you watch the pilot for Buck Rogers, watch it and, and indulge me in a theory.
556080	559960	I've never looked this up, I'd rather just entertain the theory.
559960	564000	If you watch the, there was a show in the 80s called Buck Rogers.
564000	568880	It was, there was this guy Tweaky, it had a penis head, it was a little, little robot
568880	572200	that had a penis helmet head thing.
572200	581560	And if you watch the pilot, it seems clear to me that the character of Tweaky was not
581560	583800	voiced by Mel Blanc as he became.
583800	585240	Like that's what Tweaky became.
585240	587760	Because Buck Rogers would go, come on, give me five, Tweaky.
587760	591240	And Tweaky would go, that's right, Buck.
591240	592760	Get down.
592760	596080	But I think if you watch the pilot, it's clear that this thing is just supposed to
596080	597240	walk around.
597240	602240	But then they, because it's not doing anything, but then they watched it in post and I think
602240	603920	the producers were like, this fucking sucks.
603920	607040	Like, what is this little dick robot walking around?
607040	612840	And then they brought in the voice of Bugs Bunny and he's just walking around doing nothing
612840	617800	but he's saying random shit that's like squeezed in between other dialogues.
617800	621880	And they don't establish, it doesn't say like, oh, I spent, I spent the night crossing his
621880	625440	circuits or I spilt some Michelobe on his circuit board.
625440	629440	Oh, you've infected our robot with 20th century jargon.
629440	631200	There's no addressing it at all.
631200	635560	It's just that the robot is just like going like, that's getting jiggy with it.
635560	638480	But it's like walking through and they're like, what the fuck is he, why did he say
638480	639480	that?
639480	644120	And for real, he would say modern stuff.
644120	646840	You think that was a, I think it was an afterthought.
646840	649000	I think that was the pilot.
649000	652120	And then before they got the pilot pickup or after they got the pilot pickup before
652120	657680	they shot the rest of the shit, they retooled the character in post by adding like, what
657680	660440	if he was saying all the crazy 20th century shit?
660440	661960	I, that's my theory.
661960	662960	Just watch it.
662960	666320	See if you agree or look it up, which I refuse to do because who cares once you learn the
666320	667320	truth.
667320	668320	Who cares?
668320	669320	His name was Tweaky?
669320	670320	Yeah.
670320	671320	Come on, man.
671320	672320	Yeah.
672320	673320	His name was Tweaky.
673320	677240	I mean, that that's 21st century that he's fucking, he's just a meth fucking guy.
677240	678240	Yeah.
678240	685600	He's actually named like one of our fans and he, he looks like our president's dick.
685600	689520	Our because he's, because it's silver.
689520	690520	He looks like a little mushroom.
690520	691520	He looks like toad.
691520	692520	Yeah.
692520	694680	But wait, wait, it looks like the president's dick.
694680	695680	It just looks like a dick.
695680	697680	Why is it the president's dick?
698320	703160	Because Jeremy Daniels said our, our president, Donald Trump, his dick looks like toad from
703160	704160	Mario Kart.
704160	705160	Well, see, I don't know.
705160	706160	I'm not on Twitter.
706160	707160	I don't know these things.
707160	709600	I get the, Dave Klein has to pick which things he's going to distract.
709600	711720	I know that Jay-Z has called it quits.
711720	713240	He's not endorsing Kanye anywhere.
713240	715960	That's what I know for this week.
715960	718280	Sorry.
718280	721280	How many, how many squats can you do?
721280	726120	Dude, squats are for fucking.
726120	727120	Others.
727120	728120	All right.
728120	729640	One more thing and then we'll bring in our guests.
729640	731440	So social media.
731440	741280	So I, so I, I, I Instagramed, I Instagramed my lyrics to my Nigel, Nigel had stomach surgery
741280	742280	a couple of times.
742280	743280	What?
743280	744280	Oh yeah.
744280	747520	Oh, cause he keeps eating things that aren't food.
747520	748520	Who knows?
748520	749520	I don't know.
749520	752920	I've had two rounds where, you know, and so I don't know a sketchy ass veterinarian.
752920	757920	They go, okay, he's going to eat this new stuff or whatever this, this special stuff.
757920	759480	It's called Royal canine.
759480	760480	I think that's how you pronounce it.
760480	761480	It doesn't matter.
761480	762680	That's a special dog food.
762680	763960	I don't know from nothing.
763960	768140	I'm just like, all I know is I feed my little guy Royal canine.
768140	772320	When I feed him, I, I, I riff the jingles, you know, I'm saying I'm, I'm, I'm dishing
772320	773800	it up.
773800	776520	And so then I, I was proud of one of my riffs.
776520	780960	So I recorded it like this is my jingle for Royal canine dog food.
780960	783360	I have no master.
783360	785760	I am my own.
785760	788040	I walk with no leash.
788040	795400	I walk alone cause I'm a Royal canine.
795400	800000	I only sit on thrones.
800000	804600	I am a Royal canine.
804600	807600	I hold the golden bow.
808600	812120	Okay, thank you.
812120	813120	That's very supportive.
813120	814120	Thank you.
814120	817600	So then I'm like, I, I let it sit for three days as I, I do this and I go, I'll throw
817600	822120	out a gram, a golden gram and uh, and I'll be like, oh, I'm not really active in social
822120	823120	media anymore.
823120	824120	I want to be happy.
824120	825120	I'm 45.
825120	831200	I'm, um, I, I can't, I, my self-esteem requires me to just output and not input, but then
831200	833360	I'll like go back to the crab trap and I'll open it up.
833360	835280	I go like, cause this is morbid curiosity.
835480	838080	I'm like, how can you turn, how can you turn this bad?
838080	844280	Like are the, is this going to be Nazis saying like, too bad your dog's a cuck or like your
844280	849720	dog's only with you cause you're fucking rich and you fucking, uh, the dark web has evidence
849720	854840	that you fucked that dog and like, like what, how are they going to ruin this for me?
854840	858200	And I, I predict, I said out loud to Cody, I ran through every single one.
858200	860520	It was like, that dog's too hot for your girlfriend.
861320	865400	Like, like how are they going to get misogynist racist political?
865400	866480	Like, like, what are they going to do?
866680	870360	And then when I, the only one that I didn't predict, of course, why didn't I predict this
870360	874720	was just like immediately or like, that's the, that's dog food is poison.
874840	877000	You need to feed your dog better food than that.
877160	879680	And then people responding to that and going, why don't you fucking leave them alone?
879680	880200	What the fuck?
880200	880880	What are you an expert in?
880880	882560	What dog food is, but yeah, I am.
882560	883320	I'm an expert.
883320	887320	You need to deserve that shit packed with carbohydrates and you need to give them carrots
887320	892080	and I've never seen, there's like 20.
892080	895080	There's like, there's a person in there that's like, like, just start.
895080	896800	They were like, this is my platform.
896840	898040	This is my issue.
898320	901040	Like, I am going to talk about what Dan Harmon's dog is eating.
901200	904840	And then there's all enough people like, like, like trying to knock their hat off
904840	907680	that they're like having like more excuses to type even more.
907840	910000	Their comments get longer and longer.
910200	913200	It's like, your scar was like, unbelievable.
913440	915720	Hey, I just wanted to make this observation.
915960	921440	And I know, I know the reason I want to make the observation is because I know that I'm going
921440	925360	to suffer from making it and that, that, I don't know, I guess I'm self-destructive.
925760	934520	Like, doesn't everybody see, like, come on, judge it, judge it, judge it.
934920	938160	Do you think it's really a coincidence that the people that are the most passionate
938160	941640	about animals are, I think they have the worst social skills in the world.
942640	946120	Like, like, like, do we really, I mean, can we not talk about that?
946120	950360	I just, you don't have to hate animals to observe the fact that the people that love them so much
950360	954600	that they get angry and spit in your face are like, I don't know what chicken laid what egg,
954600	957120	but I bet they could tell you what a chicken should and shouldn't do.
957400	964560	And, and don't you think that it's possible that that cycle started before they,
964560	968760	do you think that they were like super chill and tactful people that were
968760	972640	like definitely had like supreme interfacing and networking skills
972640	977320	with their colleagues and their species and then they gave all of that
977320	982080	up when they realized how important animals were or do you think it,
982080	983920	it might be the other way around.
984820	990060	We're allowed to say that about video games, ships and bottles, stamp collecting,
990060	995320	like we, we, we all, it would go like, but if you say that about an animal lover,
995320	996920	your house could get blown up.
997120	1002420	Like, it's like the implicate, like, and it's like, by the way, man, come on.
1002720	1015180	Like my hat goes, like, the requirement of being a hero has to be more than saying,
1015720	1017400	I think dogs are good.
1019320	1021160	We have to raise the bar on that.
1021160	1025120	You have to beat a steam engine while you're saying it with two hammers or something.
1025120	1027040	You have to like risk something.
1027040	1029600	You can't just be like, I love that dog.
1030020	1031080	Yeah, we all do.
1031080	1033060	He's bred to be adorable.
1033060	1038160	Like, he's, it's a 5,000 year process of throwing the ones
1038160	1040260	that weren't adorable on a campfire.
1040260	1047400	Like, he's a literally eugenics project of like, like, it's a, it's a, it's a,
1047400	1052960	it's a genetically malleable fucking like beast that we found in the wild
1052960	1054960	that reflects our human narcissism.
1055320	1059760	It is, it is an experiment in how up our own asses we are.
1060160	1062400	It, it, it, yes, we love it.
1062400	1064460	It's just, yeah, here's some other things I love.
1064460	1073880	My key chain, Pokemon, curtains, light, a glass of water after a hard walk around the block.
1075040	1076780	Dude, you're allowed to love those things.
1076780	1079660	Like, but don't, why are you yelling at people about it for?
1079660	1081080	Okay, let's bring out our guests.
1081080	1091260	I put it, I put it in the same column as, you know, it's like, like, people are, hey, oh,
1091260	1097560	I'm, if you're really proud of your gender or your race, it's like, yeah, okay, well,
1097560	1100900	so let me guess, not a lot of other cards in that Uno hand.
1101420	1104260	Like, like, like it's, the jig is up.
1104260	1105060	Come on, man.
1105060	1106300	I'm so proud to be white.
1106300	1107880	Yeah. What else have you done today?
1107880	1109280	All right.
1109300	1122560	Our next guest, our next guest, our next guest has appeared at colleges and he's a, he's a,
1122560	1123820	he's a, he's a friend.
1123820	1126960	I want to, I want to say he's an old friend because I've, I've, I've known him for so
1126960	1129720	long, but like everybody else that comes on the show, it's like, we're all workaholics.
1129720	1131060	We never actually see each other.
1131060	1135240	We don't have any actual friendships outside of when we're talking in microphones, but
1135660	1138600	just welcome the amazing Brett Gellman and let's get it on.
1139280	1158820	Hey, say, I told you, I said backstage, I said, there's no format and I'm a, I'm a
1158820	1159560	horrible host.
1159560	1163900	And you said, well, that I will, I mean, equally as horrible guests.
1163900	1166660	Yeah, no, but I'm a fan of the show.
1166660	1169260	So I know, I know that you really listen to this piece of shit.
1169260	1177220	I mean, you know, just to get my mind off myself or give myself the illusion that I'm
1177220	1183320	getting my mind off myself when we, when we moved to this venue, the dynasty typewriter
1183320	1189040	owned by the Genji Cohen, we were picking a, you had been here already.
1189040	1192320	You were, you were in the cupboards when we were touring the house, right?
1192320	1193320	What's this?
1193320	1194320	Is Brett Gellman's in here?
1194400	1199560	Yeah, I did a bunch of shows here when it, when it first was opening.
1199560	1204920	I love it here and, uh, but then it was just, whoa, way too demanding, way too demanding
1204920	1205920	to be putting up a show.
1205920	1208560	What did I miss by not seeing your show?
1208560	1215220	Um, there would always be a theme and, uh, it would, it would somewhat relate to that
1215220	1216220	theme.
1216220	1220880	And I just basically be an asshole for a two hours, no, but bring out, bring out stand
1220880	1223200	ups and things like that.
1223200	1231040	And uh, no, like I, I showed, well, my mother, when I was, when I was, uh, bar mitzvah age,
1231040	1237000	she sent these letters out to all of these, uh, comedians that she got like this big address
1237000	1239320	book from this dude in Vegas.
1239320	1243040	Like when you were a kid, like she was, yeah, when I was a kid, yeah.
1243040	1244240	And I mean, I always wanted to do that.
1244240	1245240	You want a drink by the way?
1245240	1246240	No, I'm okay.
1246240	1247240	Thank you.
1247240	1248240	Thank you so much.
1249240	1252640	I mean, I want one, but no, I'm just kidding.
1252640	1254120	Do you want me to have five of them?
1254120	1255120	Yes, I do.
1255120	1256120	I do.
1256120	1257960	I want you to have five of them for me, for me.
1257960	1258960	No, I can't.
1258960	1259960	I'm alert.
1259960	1260960	I'm physically allergic to it.
1260960	1261960	Oh no.
1261960	1262960	I can't do it.
1262960	1263960	So you get all red in the face.
1263960	1270720	I know the Jewish organs start to shut down in breeding people in breeding.
1270720	1273720	Not a lot of people in the shtetl in the old country.
1273720	1276000	You had to compromise.
1276000	1277000	You lucked out.
1277760	1280320	You don't want to hollow leg genetically.
1280320	1281640	I don't think that's like a gift.
1281640	1282640	Right.
1282640	1283640	No.
1283640	1287040	It'll help you win a couple of contests from the ages of 30 to 40, but then the rest is
1287040	1288960	all credit card debt.
1288960	1291240	And if there's anything I do, it's win contests.
1291240	1296280	I just mean like the old thing, you know, like we were so shaped like, oh, I drank him under
1296280	1297280	the table and stuff like that.
1297280	1298280	Oh, right.
1298280	1302160	You get a couple of thrills where you're like, Jesus Christ, I can't believe I drank that
1302160	1303160	dude under the table.
1303160	1304160	Right.
1304160	1305160	Right.
1305160	1306160	You get like three of those.
1306240	1314280	You have like, I think it seems the ethnicities that are that can hold their liquor the best
1314280	1317840	seem to also have these eraser moles that grow off of their body.
1317840	1318840	Uh huh.
1318840	1319840	Yeah.
1319840	1320840	It's like an Eastern European thing.
1320840	1321840	Right.
1321840	1322840	Anyway.
1322840	1323840	Sorry.
1323840	1324840	What were you talking about?
1324840	1325840	No, I got your mom.
1325840	1326840	Your mom.
1326840	1327840	I got some skin tags too, though.
1327840	1328840	I do have some skin tags.
1328840	1329840	So I'm fucked on that.
1329840	1330840	That count as well.
1330840	1336120	No, but she sent letters to all of these comedians with and she got their headshots
1336120	1339000	too from this guy, right?
1339000	1340000	And sent them a letter.
1340000	1341200	You're my son's favorite comedian.
1341200	1345160	Will you sign this picture and put in the self addressed envelope because your mom,
1345160	1348800	your mom was like, like it's Jewish connections and stuff.
1348800	1349800	She was all about.
1349800	1350800	Yeah.
1350800	1351800	She was like, and will you hire him someday?
1351800	1352800	Right.
1352800	1353800	Yeah.
1353800	1355960	And will you make his pay equal to yours?
1355960	1358120	Was your mom in the business?
1358120	1359120	Not at all.
1359120	1360120	Not at all.
1360120	1361120	What did she do?
1361120	1363160	Well, I guess in a way she's in the business.
1363160	1367880	She's an agent for photographers for advertising, but I don't think, was she doing that?
1367880	1368880	No, she was.
1368880	1372360	I think by the time I was bar mitzvah, she was showbiz adjacent.
1372360	1373560	She was definitely showbiz adjacent.
1373560	1377000	She knows the smell of the lime in the limelight, right?
1377000	1380920	And she contributes to the agency that tells showbiz what to do, right?
1380920	1382240	The advertising agency.
1382240	1384040	She certainly knows as a photographer.
1384040	1387960	She's like, look, I could point this thing at a daddy, long legs or a mountain.
1387960	1391400	And I'll either be Ansel Adams or Oprah.
1391400	1392800	Exactly.
1393440	1394440	Either way, I win.
1394440	1397040	I don't know whose famous daddy, long legs bonus.
1397040	1403400	Oh, no, Oprah, actually, she has a series of famous daddy, long legs.
1403400	1411880	In her book, Take a Walk, Daddy, My Journey from Passion to Professionalism, she talks
1411880	1415280	about the heartache of having to turn your back on what you're truly good at, what really
1415280	1417040	fulfills you for what makes money.
1417040	1418880	And she was like, I was never born to be a talk show host.
1418880	1421080	I love taking photos of daddy, long legs.
1421080	1422080	Yeah.
1422160	1427400	No, in her rider, whenever she's a guest anywhere, it's in her rider that there are 20 daddy,
1427400	1432240	long legs in her dressing room, along with three different kinds of cameras.
1432240	1434480	And that's how she warms up, apparently.
1434480	1439960	She's one of those snabs that'll quickly remind you that those aren't spiders.
1439960	1445280	And if you even go near that fucking myth about how they're actually the most toxic
1445280	1446360	insect in the world.
1446360	1447360	Is that not true?
1447360	1448560	Yeah, it's totally not true.
1448560	1449560	Oh, really?
1449560	1450560	Yeah.
1450560	1453560	It's one of those things like the 100th monkey thing or the, it's just like, you know, it's
1453560	1454560	not true.
1454560	1457760	So you don't look it up and then you look it up and of course it's not true.
1457760	1460440	What happens to every 100th monthly?
1460440	1463840	Well, put a bit of that because I just want to share in case they haven't heard it.
1463840	1464840	I'd like to talk to you about marijuana.
1464840	1465840	It's a fun myth.
1465840	1466840	Yeah.
1466840	1467840	That daddy, long legs.
1467840	1468840	You guys know what daddy, long legs are, right?
1468840	1469840	Everybody knows that.
1469840	1479520	The myth is that they're poisonous, and they actually, their poison could kill you.
1479520	1483400	It's actually the most toxic poison per drop capita.
1483400	1484400	But they're stingers too.
1484400	1486360	But they can't penetrate human skin.
1486360	1492640	So if they ever were to try to kill you, they would just never be like giving the son of
1492640	1493960	Sam a wiffle ball bat.
1493960	1494960	Like it's just a...
1494960	1497040	But the monkey though, what's the monkey one?
1497040	1498040	What's that?
1498040	1499040	What's the 100th monkey?
1499040	1500040	Okay, the 100th monkey thing.
1500040	1501040	Jeff, you know that one.
1501040	1502040	Yeah, the 100th monkey.
1502040	1503040	You introduced me to that one.
1503040	1509480	That's the theory that there was monkeys on an island and they learned how to take a
1509480	1512000	potato, and they found out...
1512000	1513000	There was a start...
1513000	1515000	Do you want me to grab it?
1515000	1517000	Take a baby.
1517000	1518000	Grab...
1518000	1519000	Grab this baby and...
1519000	1520640	I want you to ration and grab it.
1520640	1524840	It seems like your pinchers aren't penetrating my epidermis.
1524840	1528680	I know the information you got could fucking blow my mind, but I'm not feeling the pinchers.
1528680	1530760	That was the daddy, long legs of information.
1530760	1535680	The idea that any community of animals that start learning one new trait that across
1535680	1542200	the world, there's no way they could have communicated, they all start to...
1542200	1547720	The legend was that there was anthropological, or whatever you call it when it's monkeys,
1547720	1548720	monk-a-logical.
1548720	1549720	Monk-a-logical.
1549720	1550720	Primatological.
1550720	1557840	Like the watchtower, it was in an archipelago or something, they were like monitoring this
1557840	1563880	monkey population, and the monkey population would eat potatoes, and then they observed
1563880	1571800	a monkey dropping its potato in some salt water, and then fishing it out and eating
1571800	1578480	it, and then observed it being blown away by both a cleaner potato and a salted potato,
1578480	1581480	and then observed it teaching a friend monkey...
1581480	1584800	All of this scans with what we know about monkeys, they're actually quite smart.
1584800	1592280	They could right-hammell it if you gave them enough time, and space, and typewriters.
1592280	1598680	The 100th monkey principle is sort of a pop science X-factor principle that says that
1598680	1604320	these people were watching this group of monkeys on one island, and that when the 100th monkey
1604320	1611640	learned to wash their potato, that spontaneously an unrelated research, or unconnected research
1611640	1619200	tower watching the same species, but a completely unconnected island of monkeys, that they spontaneously
1619200	1624760	began washing their potatoes without any causal thing.
1624760	1631800	So the 100th monkey concept is the idea of genetic Wi-Fi, of like, learn...
1631800	1632800	Every...
1632800	1633800	But it's a myth.
1633800	1635400	But it's a myth that never happened.
1635400	1641720	Every 100th monkey is psychic.
1641720	1651240	I think it's the idea that, evolutionary-wise, when enough of a community learns something,
1651240	1657960	it becomes global, because it was an evolutionary thing that was going to happen anyway.
1657960	1661040	Yeah, I think the idea would be with some of this stuff, which I think is important
1661040	1668080	to stay open to, because God knows, before Einstein, they believed in this shit called
1668080	1669080	the ether.
1669080	1670080	They had to.
1670080	1671960	They had to build in all of the blank spaces.
1671960	1675400	When there's that many blank spaces, why does light behave this way?
1675400	1683000	So scientists in the modern world, a world that had gasoline watches, not quite television,
1683000	1687360	but boy, if you saw one of these people in a time travel town, like, you wouldn't...
1687360	1688360	They wouldn't be an alien.
1688360	1693240	This was like the fucking 20s, and people believed in this, like, interstellar jelly
1693240	1699000	that we couldn't see or detect, called the ether, that was the thing that explained why
1699000	1704560	if you turn on your flashlight in a box car that's traveling, that a person observing
1704560	1707920	the box car will see the light, I'd move it a different...
1707920	1710320	Whatever the fuck.
1710320	1714640	Whatever the blank spaces were, and all the questions that we needed to answer about light.
1714640	1719000	Honestly, I can't wrap my brain around even the questions that they're asking, so I don't
1719000	1721520	blame them for inventing this thing called the ether.
1721520	1723120	They're like, well, that's the ether.
1723120	1732440	They would say, if you're driving in a box car, that it's filled with ether, which we
1732440	1736520	can't measure, it doesn't weigh anything, it's just like this jelly that travels with
1736520	1737520	the box car.
1737520	1740240	Why are people driving in box cars?
1740240	1747360	So, because they were trying to illustrate that, you know the old stand-up joke, if you're
1747360	1751720	traveling at the speed of light in your car and you turn the headlights on, what happens?
1751720	1755600	So, it starts with a legitimate question that they really had.
1755600	1756600	What happens?
1756600	1762000	Well, theoretically, yeah, I don't know, do the headlights fall off?
1762000	1763000	Do you get younger?
1763000	1764360	Does the light turn into a candle?
1764360	1765360	Who did that joke?
1765360	1766360	Who did that joke originally?
1766360	1767360	Who did it first?
1767360	1768360	Einstein.
1768360	1769360	I think that was Paul Rodriguez.
1769360	1770360	Paul Rodriguez, I think.
1770360	1781560	The speed of light in my Mario was...
1781560	1785680	Anyways, it seems like a Stephen Wright kind of thing.
1785680	1788120	Yeah, I thought it was maybe Stephen Wright.
1788120	1793800	But anyways, god damn it, some fucking whatever, but I'm saying, people make up fairy tales.
1793800	1796960	The scientific community makes up shit.
1796960	1803560	That's why it's so annoying when ever anybody argues science in terms of an argument for
1803560	1804560	something.
1804560	1807680	I mean, no, it's not always annoying, actually.
1807680	1809720	It's quite essential these days.
1809720	1814720	Actually, I'm in the opposite of what I just said.
1814720	1822560	Yeah, no, I mean, we should...
1822560	1823560	Never mind.
1823560	1824560	I'm not even going to...
1824560	1828320	I do have a point beyond that point, but I'm not going to even make it because I need to
1828320	1831160	support science right now, fully and utterly.
1831160	1832760	No, listen to science.
1832760	1835040	Science is right, 100%.
1835040	1836400	Let's go with science.
1836400	1840600	Drive that on for size, world and United States.
1840600	1841600	Yeah.
1841600	1843760	I think science is having a pretty good year right now.
1843760	1844760	Do we have science?
1844760	1845760	You think so?
1845760	1846760	Science is having a good run.
1846760	1850240	They're definitely heroes right now.
1850240	1851240	Yeah.
1851240	1854680	Like the way Han Solo was at the end of Empire.
1854680	1855680	Exactly.
1855680	1856680	Yeah.
1856680	1857680	Oh, yeah.
1857680	1858680	Oh no, totally.
1858680	1862160	Definitely our favorite character walking out of the theater at this very sad point.
1862160	1863160	Right.
1863800	1865680	Science got frozen in carbonite.
1865680	1867080	Yeah.
1867080	1873520	But right before it did, it said, I know, too, I love you.
1873520	1879600	Maybe one of us need to dress up like Princess Leia did.
1879600	1882040	We have to scam science free, right?
1882040	1885120	We have to stop taking the high road and make that low road and...
1885120	1886120	I'll extend this metaphor.
1886120	1891520	I hope when science thaws out, it is as big a pussy as Han Solo was in Jedi.
1891520	1896080	Sorry for using pussy as a pejorative.
1896080	1899280	Because science needs to...
1899280	1905760	If we survive this culture war, I would like to see one of the side effects be that science,
1905760	1912160	just in general, not scientists, not each individual scientist, but a two-way agreement
1912160	1915320	between people and science, which says, you know what?
1915320	1922440	Science is a religion in the sense that it is a connection to the unknown, and therefore
1922440	1929040	you can't necessarily be science and simultaneously say, I don't care.
1929040	1930040	I don't know what happens.
1930040	1931240	I don't care what happens.
1931240	1932240	Who gives a shit?
1932240	1933440	It's not my job.
1933440	1935360	You know what I mean?
1935360	1942240	We are lost, little lambs, because we did, a long time ago, agree to trust in science
1942240	1946880	over all this other Michigas.
1946880	1954000	In spite of what we see every day that frustrates us, we have as a species decided to be humanist
1954000	1959200	and be like, look, I'm not going to believe things that people that threaten to burn you
1959200	1964280	at the stake tell me to believe, I'm going to believe the people looking through telescopes.
1964280	1972040	And so, since we're obviously not going to spontaneously develop a culture that saves
1972040	1975640	us, that chills us to be good people, and since we no longer want to base that on whether
1975640	1981440	you go to heaven or hell, the next step is we have to become like Vulcan, you know?
1981440	1983240	We need a science Jesus.
1983240	1988680	We need a science Jesus who won't act like Jesus, because he'll be like, I don't want
1988680	1989680	to get crucified.
1989680	1991880	I'm a scientist.
1991880	1997760	All of my data shows that will hurt and will kill me.
1997760	2000800	All I ask is for you to think about that for a second.
2000800	2009840	Empathy is scientifically proven to solve our problems, communication, honesty.
2009840	2013920	Maybe connect some of these things that we currently look at as being like moralistic
2013920	2020600	and disconnect morality from this other thing that we call religion so that we can finally
2020600	2028160	be like, we still connect the concept of atheism to amorality.
2028160	2029160	It's still getting done.
2029160	2030960	It still gets done in your head.
2030960	2033800	We got to fix that.
2033800	2036400	I feel like Spencer is our science Jesus.
2036400	2039040	Oh, shit.
2039040	2040040	You guys.
2040040	2041040	You're in trouble, buddy.
2041040	2046000	I got a boxcar full of ether out back.
2046000	2055880	Wow, what a science Jesus.
2055880	2056880	Wow.
2056880	2061400	And the street value of ether is through the roof now that it's been disproven.
2061400	2062400	I know.
2062400	2064400	You can't make more.
2064400	2067160	The bad news is we were wrong about the ether.
2067160	2070800	The good news is we got a fucking ton of it, everybody.
2070800	2071800	Let's get nuts.
2071800	2072800	Someone has Quaaludes.
2072800	2073800	Right.
2073800	2074800	Is ether the new Quaaludes?
2074800	2075800	Or it was back then?
2075800	2076800	Quaaludes are the new ether.
2076800	2077800	Right.
2077800	2078800	But also those are gone.
2078800	2079800	I know.
2079800	2080800	What about Poppers?
2080800	2090600	You guys do Poppers?
2090600	2093880	Like Jalapeno or amyl nitrate?
2093880	2096280	Jalapeno or amyl nitrate?
2096280	2099280	I did it once at a bar.
2099280	2101280	The cleaning fluid, right?
2101280	2103480	I don't know.
2103480	2104800	I'll take anything that comes in a Popper.
2104800	2107160	T-pad cleaning was in the 80s.
2107160	2108880	It was like the DIY.
2108880	2109880	I remember it.
2109880	2113880	the door, the movie The Doors, where I first saw a popper. And I was like, what is that?
2113880	2116560	I still don't know. That's why I bring it up at comedy shows.
2116560	2119520	I don't know. It's like a thing that you release in your notes.
2119520	2124600	Dan, your dad had cleaning fluid for videotape. That's amyl nitrate.
2124600	2127640	And you could buy that. No, that's not amyl nitrate that I know of. I don't know if it's
2127640	2135160	related the way Sudafed is related to meth or whatever. But, like, I just always...
2135160	2137040	Let's find out.
2137080	2142360	I know the two things that they... I know the one thing that those two things have in common.
2142360	2143360	What?
2143360	2147000	Is that they supposedly dilate your butthole.
2147000	2148720	Oh.
2148720	2154280	Like amyl nitrate poppers and huffing tape head cleaner. There were these things called
2154280	2163120	tapes. And these things called buttholes that we believe needed to be dilated.
2163120	2169200	Back in the early 80s, your butt had holes.
2169200	2172560	It would be good. I mean, what a great thing if you're constipated.
2172560	2173560	Oh, yeah.
2173560	2177840	Yeah, but do you think if you dilate your butt and you're constipated, do you think
2177840	2180560	the turd just falls out like a...
2180560	2182560	You're probably right. We're not horses.
2182560	2185400	Yeah, I don't know if it's like when you're...
2185400	2189640	That's probably not what happens to horses either. It looks like that, that their asshole's
2189640	2194160	just opening and shit drops out. But no, there's probably a pushing that's... I mean,
2194160	2197080	there's definitely a pushing that's going up. There's a digestive tract in a horse.
2197080	2200960	I'm sure. I wouldn't be afraid of it just falling out with horses and elephants because
2200960	2203600	they're literally eating fiber. That's all they eat.
2203600	2206960	They're taking in so much fiber.
2206960	2211240	But I did... Okay, well, we don't have to talk about this, but I did actually come to
2211240	2216320	think of it. I was severely constipated once because I was on the Atkins diet and I told
2216320	2222800	this story over here before where I had a softball-sized... How do I put this turd?
2222800	2223800	Yeah.
2223800	2230680	Like breaching, like crowning. And I was unable to... And there's this whole story of Rob Schwab
2230680	2237280	coming over and sliding some drug he found in a grocery store because I texted him, help
2237280	2243800	me. And he brought some thing that he bought that's supposed to help make you poop. And
2243800	2249240	he read... It was like a fucking 80s sitcom joke where he read the directions and then...
2249240	2253320	We had a Halloween party that night, so he read the directions that like, take one tablet
2253320	2257840	and you'll poop in two hours. So he just was like, what are we going to go to the party
2257840	2260600	in 15 minutes? Take four of these.
2260600	2268160	Oh, no. And I just believed him. He just slid pills under the door. He didn't slide directions,
2268160	2273760	nor would I have read them. I was like... If you're texting Rob Schwab for help, you're
2273760	2280720	helpless. You've realized that you have no friends and that your life is flashing before
2280720	2281720	your eyes.
2281720	2282720	Yeah, yeah.
2282720	2283720	And yeah.
2283720	2284720	Did you shit your pants at the party?
2284720	2293360	Yeah. No, I didn't shit my pants. I made it to the bathroom and unzipped my Ghostbusters
2293360	2294360	jumpsuit.
2294360	2297080	Ooh, Halloween.
2297080	2302160	And I never followed up with the person whose house it was to see if I cracked the porcelain
2302160	2309920	because what happened is nothing happened to the softball. This drug that Schwab quadrupled
2309920	2317560	was just like... It was just jamming gunpowder into the breach. It was just putting it...
2317560	2330000	So I just fucking fired this fucking Blackbeard fucking pirate movie. A cannonball, a cannonball.
2330000	2334920	I don't know why I'm... Why am I... How do I put this? It was a... I already put it that
2334920	2341320	way. It was a fucking ball of hard shit flying out of my ass explosively. I'm pretty sure
2341320	2347720	I... And then I just went home. Ghost busted.
2347720	2348720	Right. Everything...
2348720	2349720	Who you gonna call?
2349720	2350720	Yeah. A plumber.
2350720	2351720	Anyways.
2351720	2361400	Yeah, no. I mean, after you do that, the rest of the night's gonna be incredibly anticlimactic.
2361400	2366520	Yeah. It's like going to Vietnam, I assume. Like, gonna come back out, listen to your
2366520	2367520	stories about improv?
2367520	2368520	Right.
2368520	2370720	You can't... I got some improv for you.
2370720	2371720	Yeah.
2371720	2373600	I just yes-handed fucking biology.
2373600	2381680	Yeah. You just handed that cannonball by forcefully firing it from your dilated asshole.
2382640	2383640	Yeah.
2383640	2388320	Like, altered states. Like, I'm coming out with goat blood on my chin.
2388320	2389320	Oof.
2389320	2390320	I like when I...
2390320	2391320	Oof.
2391320	2396040	We may have discussed this on the show before, but when you were on the cabbage soup diet...
2396040	2400360	Ah, man. Well, you're gonna follow up one poop thing with another. But yeah, of course
2400360	2402080	we've discussed it. Of course we have.
2402080	2403080	It was bad.
2403080	2406960	This is him referencing the way I described a shit I took. It's, you know, I don't...
2406960	2411240	I just want to register my shame. I... How did we get here?
2411280	2415960	Brett, he described a shit he took on the cabbage soup diet as he looked back at the
2415960	2418280	ball and said, it looks like the Kennedy autopsy.
2418280	2419280	All right.
2419280	2424760	Okay. All right. These are private communications with a friend.
2424760	2426880	All right, look.
2426880	2430920	No one told me we'd be living in this world where all of this is everyone's business.
2430920	2437360	I don't know about the audience here and at home, but I completely understand what you're
2437360	2438760	talking about.
2438760	2442200	I like to give things weight when I describe them.
2442200	2444600	Yeah. Of course. How could you not?
2444600	2449880	You can't be on a show either and just say, oh yeah, it was diarrhea. It's boring.
2449880	2452840	Yeah. And I know a lot of people are gonna go, what? Those photos are black and white.
2452840	2456480	And I'm saying yes, but they were colored with national tragedy.
2456480	2458840	Exactly.
2458840	2460760	And historic importance.
2460760	2461760	Yeah.
2461760	2464760	And misconduct.
2464760	2468240	Like possible tampering at the highest levels.
2468240	2469240	Yeah.
2469240	2470240	Certainly grief.
2470240	2471240	Very tragic.
2471240	2472240	Grief.
2472240	2473240	I'll just camelot them.
2473240	2474240	Yeah.
2474240	2475240	Very tragic.
2475240	2476240	Very tragic event.
2476240	2478480	It's the appropriate palette to draw from emotionally.
2478480	2479480	Yeah.
2479480	2484120	The fact that Zapruder himself filmed that shit that you took, it makes sense.
2484120	2486080	All right.
2486080	2489120	Imagine the people that listen, some people listen to like all 400 episodes of this podcast.
2489120	2493440	They're like, this is the fifth time they've talked about that cabbage soup shit.
2493440	2496640	For a second in the middle of that story, when you're like, and Rob was at the grocery store
2496640	2498240	and he's like, yeah, I'll get you something.
2498240	2504200	And what he brought back in my mind was going to be ahead of lettuce because it went quite
2504200	2505200	differently.
2505200	2508200	Like lettuce fights cabbage, like a mongoose and a cobra.
2508200	2509200	Oh no.
2509200	2512760	I mean with the with the with the cannonball with the meatball.
2512760	2514760	Okay.
2514760	2515760	Sorry.
2515760	2516760	All right.
2516760	2517760	Well.
2517760	2518760	Wow.
2518760	2519760	People got it.
2519760	2521600	I feel like people reacted to that.
2521600	2523320	Like I think they're mad at us.
2523320	2524880	I think they're mad.
2524880	2527200	And I, I hope it's not because they're disturbed.
2527200	2528920	It must be just like, okay, enough.
2528920	2529920	Yeah.
2529920	2530920	They're exhausted.
2530920	2531920	They're just exhausted.
2531920	2532920	Yeah.
2532920	2533920	It's exhausting.
2533920	2537080	They express that sometimes through applause, like, where they're like, that's great.
2537080	2540080	And enough.
2540080	2543480	And then that's, yeah, that's the average person who watches anything.
2543480	2544480	Yeah.
2544480	2545480	We do.
2545480	2546480	They're good.
2546480	2547480	They're good kids.
2547480	2548480	They mean well.
2548480	2549480	Of course.
2549480	2550480	Oh no, I didn't mean that.
2550480	2551480	They had no idea that.
2551480	2552480	No, of course.
2552480	2553480	I'm blaming us.
2553480	2554480	I'm fully blaming us.
2554480	2558120	We handed you a pre-ruined world.
2558120	2560120	Finally.
2560120	2572080	Enjoy living in a volcano with a cloned pterodactyl who's had its genes merged with a criminal
2572080	2577000	so that we could justify paying it three cents an hour.
2577000	2581280	Then if you complain about it pecking your kidney out while it's delivering packages
2581280	2584440	for Amazon, you get sued.
2584440	2585440	Enjoy.
2585440	2586440	Enjoy yourself.
2586440	2587440	Hey, at least all of that is scientific.
2587440	2589880	We got cloning in there.
2589880	2590880	We got.
2590880	2591880	We love science.
2591880	2595600	We got money exchanges, which is, in a way, a science.
2595600	2596600	Oh yeah.
2596600	2597800	It's definitely not.
2597800	2598800	From the people that brought you.
2598800	2599800	Hocus Pocus.
2599800	2600800	It's real.
2600800	2601800	Me too.
2601800	2602800	Yeah.
2602800	2605760	So, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, I, I, of course.
2605760	2607000	Yes.
2607000	2612640	The reason, the reason I am a Lifetime fan is because I, I think I was the number one
2613640	2614640	Eagle, Eagle Heart fan.
2614640	2615640	Oh really?
2615640	2616640	Yeah.
2616640	2617640	Yeah.
2617640	2618640	You must have been.
2618640	2619640	And that means a lot.
2619640	2620640	You could hear that.
2620640	2621640	I said the name of the show and no one applauded.
2621640	2622640	Yeah.
2622640	2623640	Oh no.
2623640	2624640	Nobody watched that show.
2624640	2625640	Nobody watched it.
2625640	2626640	It's a true crime.
2626640	2627640	I think it was a great show.
2627640	2628640	Thank you.
2628640	2629640	It was such a masterpiece.
2629640	2630640	I really, really enjoyed it.
2630640	2631640	Thanks.
2631640	2632640	I binge watched it.
2632640	2633640	I was so impressed with everybody.
2633640	2637400	That was like my first steady job that I was proud of.
2637400	2638400	Yeah.
2638400	2639400	To be a part of.
2639400	2640400	Yeah.
2640400	2641720	It was, it was really something.
2641720	2644760	It was, yeah, it was really fun to work on.
2644760	2651320	Plus like working with Chris, you know, who was, I feel like a lot of us wouldn't be here
2651320	2652320	right now if it wasn't for Chris.
2652320	2658360	I totally, I mean, I was a kid, I got to say to him because he worked on community as a,
2658360	2659360	in a cameo.
2659360	2663320	So I finally got to say to him, which just felt like it's like somebody, you have heroes
2663320	2666480	that you know, it doesn't matter that you're going to say to them, but you just, it feels
2666480	2668640	like it's like the Mecca thing.
2668640	2671680	Like you just, I have to, I have to say to this person, I have to get this out.
2671680	2675200	I have to go to this wall and it's not going to affect them.
2675200	2681240	I need to like, like touch and say, uh, when I was 12 years old, blah, blah, blah.
2681240	2683480	And, uh, you know, I got to say that to Catherine O'Hara.
2683480	2684960	I got to say that to Martin Short.
2684960	2689960	I got to say that I needed to say to Chris Elliott, thank you so much for doing a action
2689960	2690960	family on Cinemax.
2690960	2691960	Did you remember that?
2691960	2692960	Oh yeah.
2692960	2693960	The best.
2693960	2695360	And FDR a one man show.
2695360	2696360	Yeah.
2696360	2697360	Like, do you see that?
2697360	2698360	No, I didn't, I didn't see that.
2698360	2699360	Oh, that's on you.
2699360	2700360	You should watch that.
2700360	2701360	You'll love that.
2701360	2702360	That was on Cinemax.
2702360	2703360	That was his other special.
2703360	2704360	Oh, okay.
2704360	2705360	Yeah.
2705360	2706360	Yeah.
2706360	2707360	The action family was like the fellas.
2707360	2713200	The I never, when was I ever going to see anyone deconstructively saying like, Oh, like
2713200	2717120	I was still just a kid going like, well, I don't know why people are laughing whenever
2717120	2718120	this happens.
2718120	2719680	I don't know why this film stock is being used.
2719680	2720680	Like, right.
2720680	2725400	Like you need to see that shit deconstructed as soon as possible, like as young as possible.
2725400	2731320	Your, well, your neurology is still, yeah, he doesn't get enough credit for what he did.
2731320	2739040	I think he's one, I think he's one of the most, if not the most underappreciated American
2739040	2740560	comedian, I think.
2740560	2741560	Yeah.
2741560	2744320	But I mean, completely innovative and crazy.
2744320	2745320	Yeah.
2745320	2748720	No, I told him I loved him.
2748720	2750640	And then he was, and he was kind of a dick about it, right?
2750640	2751640	He's a dick.
2751640	2752640	No, I'm kidding.
2752640	2753640	Okay.
2753640	2754640	No, he would torture me.
2754640	2756080	He would torture me, but he made me tough.
2756080	2757480	It was, I think out of love.
2757480	2758480	I don't know.
2758480	2759480	Well, it was probably self loaded.
2759480	2764440	Like nobody likes you, like nobody likes you.
2764440	2766520	I'd be like, people like me.
2766520	2768640	You had to be like a second banana.
2768640	2772840	You had to be a straight man in order to hang out, you know, and he would just be there.
2772840	2773840	No.
2773840	2774840	And I'd be like, people like me.
2774840	2775840	Everybody likes me here.
2775840	2776840	Oh yeah.
2776840	2778440	They like you as a person, but not as an actor.
2778440	2779440	You're terrible.
2779440	2781240	You're terrible, but it's okay.
2781240	2786520	We're all terrible, but you're, I'm the best Maria's in the middle and you're the fucking
2786520	2787520	worst.
2787520	2788520	Mr. UCB.
2788520	2790640	Ooh, I've got a hat.
2790640	2792960	Let me put it on and become someone else.
2792960	2797880	He would do that to me for hours all day, all day.
2797880	2799760	I guess that's my wheelhouse.
2799760	2805240	Like I, that I've learned to just, I've learned to like pull back on because it does just
2805240	2811320	over, I guess it's toxic, you know, it toxifies people, but the place it comes from though
2811320	2814480	is like, it's truly like you're lampooning yourself.
2814480	2819240	You see, like that was, it was always my formula in my thirties was I was always like,
2819240	2823200	can you imagine if I was bullying you for this, how funny that would be.
2823200	2827720	But like then the times kind of evolved into like, of course I can imagine you bullying
2827720	2828720	me for it.
2828720	2829720	Right.
2829720	2830720	The president is a Nazi.
2830720	2831720	Yeah.
2831720	2832720	Yeah.
2832720	2833720	I should shut up now.
2833720	2835640	I think I would be taking this all a lot worse if it weren't for Chris.
2835640	2838440	I think I would be taking Trump even worse.
2838440	2844400	Not that I'm taking it well, but no, but yeah, no, this one time I, there was a scene
2844600	2849320	where I don't remember why, but my, my character's legs had been sewn off and I was like in
2849320	2853200	this apparatus in this table and it looked like I was just like legless sitting on this
2853200	2855280	table and it was so fucking hot.
2855280	2859800	We like rented out this like warehouse and turned it into a studio in Santa Clarita.
2859800	2863280	It was not a, it was, it was like dead of summer.
2863280	2864280	So fucking hot.
2864280	2868520	The AC, like you might as well have not had it on and I'm there, I'm like sweating my
2868520	2874360	ass off and then he's around and he's doing the scene with me and he's like, oh my God,
2875280	2876640	you smell like duty.
2878600	2879600	Oh my God.
2879640	2880840	Oh, pungent.
2880880	2881520	Oh God.
2881520	2882360	Disgusting.
2882360	2883880	You said, did you shower this one?
2884040	2885600	You smell like duty.
2885760	2889360	He's like, everybody, everybody let me, and I'm like, I don't smell like duty.
2889440	2890480	I don't smell like duty.
2890480	2891440	He's like, yes, you do.
2891440	2892360	You smell like duty.
2892880	2898640	And then he was like, everybody got the whole crew to line up and smell the top
2898640	2904360	crack of my ass in order to agree with him that I smelled like duty.
2904400	2911680	That's, that's, I'm going to say that's too much just because I like to keep it verbal.
2911720	2913280	Yeah, no, it was physical.
2913280	2914960	I don't like smelling things that triggers me.
2915080	2918040	Yeah, no, I got sniffed a lot on the playground.
2918080	2922400	I never was like so simultaneously pissed off and then laughing so hard.
2922400	2923120	What happened?
2923160	2924200	Did you smell like, did you smell like duty?
2924760	2925600	Maybe I did.
2925600	2926640	Maybe I did smell like duty.
2926640	2929440	And then I went back in my trailer after I cleaned up.
2929440	2933760	And then there was a pair of tidy whiteies waiting for me that he had colored in the
2933760	2937120	ass with brown marker and left for me in my trailer.
2938400	2942120	Now you have to call HR on him because that's fucking terrible.
2942400	2944000	No, no, it was all out of good fun.
2944040	2946360	You know, do you know why the police officer smelled bad?
2948040	2951720	I do because they're a big fan of Chris and they wanted to see if it was his real
2951720	2953200	duty or just a marker.
2953240	2954200	No, wait, let me know.
2954200	2955760	Why did they say I want to guess.
2956200	2958440	Why did the police officer smell bad?
2958520	2960400	Why did the police officer smell bad?
2960440	2960720	Yeah.
2960920	2961720	Oh, this is a joke.
2961720	2962080	I'm sorry.
2962080	2963040	I thought you said that.
2964200	2964920	I'm so sorry.
2964920	2967080	Why did the police officers smell bad?
2967080	2968400	Just give me, let me figure.
2968440	2969080	I'm on it now.
2969080	2969360	Yeah.
2969560	2969960	Okay.
2970720	2972200	Everybody, you've heard it.
2972400	2975280	Let Dan, let Dan smell bad.
2975280	2985680	Odor, odor, odor, odor, odor, odor, arrest, odor, odor, odor, odor, odor, odor, odor,
2985680	2986520	odor in the court.
2986520	2987360	No, that's a judge.
2988200	2988520	I know.
2988520	2991720	I now know why they asked me why the judge smelled bad later.
2991920	2992600	Well, okay.
2992800	2993840	Sidebar, sidebar.
2993840	2995680	Why, why did the judge smell bad?
2995920	2997120	He wanted to odor in the court.
2997160	2997520	Okay.
2997840	3001920	Yeah, but, but now back to your little, uh, rubric.
3002000	3006840	Um, why, why, why did the police officer smell bad?
3007320	3008160	And nobody help him.
3008160	3008760	Nobody help him.
3009000	3010080	Is that what a rubric is?
3010080	3011160	What the fuck is a rubric?
3012520	3013000	What is a rubric?
3013000	3013720	Is it a puzzle?
3013720	3014720	It's a puzzle.
3014760	3014960	Yeah.
3014960	3015320	Okay.
3015840	3019360	Back to your little rubric, uh, rubric.
3019360	3019760	I like that.
3019760	3022560	Do you think that's so Rubik's name probably wasn't Rubik.
3022560	3024680	He was probably like, like Rubstein or something.
3024680	3026080	And he changed it for showbiz.
3028120	3030280	They're never going to buy this cube from a Jew.
3030920	3031960	You got to change it.
3031960	3034080	People are sick of solving Jews problems.
3034520	3036000	I want it to be Rubstein.
3037000	3042880	This, this symbolizes the, the, the, the complicated mind of the Jewish person.
3042880	3043920	Yeah, kid, I'm your agent.
3043920	3044880	I'm Jewish too.
3044880	3048160	But listen, just call it the puzzle business.
3048160	3049160	It's merciless.
3050520	3055320	You, you're inviting the, the, the, the mind for solutions that you don't want.
3055680	3056080	Okay.
3056680	3059400	Uh, Oh my God.
3059400	3062040	That was either, that either didn't land or landed.
3062040	3063800	And everyone was like, I'm being a landed on me.
3064840	3065880	Uh, all right.
3065960	3070560	The, uh, what the police officer smell bad because arrest, arrest,
3070560	3076480	handcuffs, arrest, uh, odor, smell, it wouldn't be smell.
3076520	3077480	It's a sniff.
3077520	3080360	Uh, nose, nose, nose, paddy wagon.
3080400	3082920	Uh, do you have any guesses?
3082920	3084200	Do you, do you have any guesses?
3085320	3086920	Uh, Brett, do you have any guesses?
3087840	3088200	No.
3088240	3089600	Cause he, all right.
3089600	3090320	Shit his pants.
3091240	3095040	No, he, it wasn't in his jurif sniff shin.
3097760	3098960	I know it.
3099040	3099800	I know it.
3100120	3100440	Okay.
3100440	3102240	I'm going to write it on a piece of paper.
3102280	3103160	His partner.
3103160	3104520	No, no, you can, you can say it out loud.
3104520	3108360	Do you already know it or have you, have you, have you, I feel like you've told
3108360	3110120	this one before and I just remembered it.
3110120	3110520	Yes.
3111520	3112600	No, you do it though.
3113200	3113840	What is it?
3114160	3118200	Well, I'm going to ask Spencer and he's going to give you the punch line.
3118920	3119400	Spencer.
3119800	3120280	Why?
3124640	3128240	You see, I think we might've both got it because he's the Popo.
3128400	3129160	Yeah.
3129160	3133080	No, no, I mean, that wouldn't have been funny.
3133080	3134360	I would have been mad at you if that was it.
3134920	3137160	I just got excited because I was like, wait, they call him Popo.
3137160	3138000	And that's almost poo poo.
3138040	3144480	Because Spencer, why, why did the police have to smell bad?
3145760	3147080	Because he had a duty.
3147800	3149360	He, no, why?
3150360	3151280	I like mine.
3151320	3156200	I like mine because he, I like mine because he was on duty because he was on duty.
3156240	3157520	That's the same joke.
3158520	3158960	Duty.
3159720	3160280	All right.
3161000	3162880	He had a duty to protect.
3164600	3169560	Because he had a duty to, why, why did the honorable, hardworking police,
3169800	3171360	because he was in the line of duty.
3171400	3172600	I mean, it's all, it all works.
3172600	3173080	It's fine.
3173080	3174400	It's all good.
3174400	3178440	If you were in a game show and he said in the line of duty, if he judges and
3178440	3180480	they'd get a ding, otherwise people are going to riot.
3182120	3183680	Duty's good duty.
3183920	3184360	Thank you.
3184360	3185360	I appreciate that.
3185440	3185800	Yeah.
3185840	3186560	No, that's good.
3187560	3190760	But I think there's, there's work to be done on the, on the poo poo.
3191120	3193040	I think there's a joke there.
3193040	3193880	We could get there.
3193920	3194440	Yeah.
3194480	3198320	Why, do you know why the stunt man smelled bad?
3198600	3199120	Why?
3200760	3201520	Why, give me a second.
3201560	3202120	Oh, okay.
3202120	3202800	Because.
3202800	3204720	Are you writing a new one for that?
3204720	3205160	Yeah.
3205280	3205640	Yeah.
3205680	3211040	Because he had to do a stunt, he or she, or they had to do a stunt.
3212800	3215560	Uh, where they took a gigantic shit.
3216560	3217680	That's probably it.
3217760	3219520	That's probably so scatological.
3219840	3221080	This is terrible.
3221120	3222280	Tell us why in the stunt, man.
3222280	3222760	Why?
3222880	3224080	I'm going to go with Brett's.
3224080	3228240	I didn't, I didn't, I was not making a rhetorical question.
3228240	3233080	They had to do a stunt where they rolled around in a skunk yard.
3233080	3233600	Yeah.
3235000	3237080	You have to box with that's adorable.
3237400	3239160	What smells worse than a junkyard?
3240280	3241360	A skunk yard.
3241400	3243400	Oh, it's pretty good, right?
3243920	3249920	Oh God, I don't want people to think these were all good memories with you.
3249920	3250960	It was not abusing me.
3250960	3251600	It was fun.
3251880	3257040	You know, I, I, I mean, maybe it was abuse and I just didn't register it as that.
3257040	3261800	But let's, you know, we have to be okay with being a little mean at times.
3261800	3264200	Still, especially on our side.
3264200	3266400	Do you know what's, I think we need to be a little meaner.
3266440	3268440	What's purple and very dangerous.
3268560	3270280	What a grief with a machine gun.
3270560	3270920	Yeah.
3270960	3273360	Oh, see, sometimes you gotta be edgy.
3273600	3274080	Right.
3275640	3281280	Or I'm sorry if that fucking offended you, but it's true.
3281280	3281760	Okay.
3281760	3284600	If you gave a machine gun, it fucking kill you.
3286280	3287960	Uh, yeah.
3288440	3288960	Do you know what?
3288960	3292360	Uh, my mom told me this was my favorite.
3292360	3293800	This was the first joke I ever told.
3293800	3295200	This is my favorite joke when I was a kid.
3295200	3296240	You don't remember telling it.
3296440	3297360	I don't remember telling it.
3297360	3297680	Okay.
3297680	3302480	My mom could be full of shit, but she, she includes the pronunciation of the punch
3302480	3308040	line that I would do is my, it was, uh, what's, uh, what's gray and has four legs
3308040	3311520	and a trunk, a mouse going on vacation.
3312520	3314480	Oh, great.
3314520	3315120	I like that.
3316640	3318640	It seems a little very sophisticated joke.
3318640	3319720	I believe that you told it.
3319720	3320200	I don't know.
3320200	3322080	It seems like I, I feel like that's confusing.
3322080	3322760	We're spalding.
3323760	3325480	I was just spalding gray, but then we're in a gray barrel.
3325680	3326040	Okay.
3326080	3331760	I feel like that joke qualifies as child abuse because the child is abusing.
3331840	3333080	It's joke Bunchausen.
3333080	3334240	She's projecting.
3335080	3340120	She's projecting her need to tell jokes to you, which in the end served you.
3340240	3345200	Yeah, no, it's like, it's like, I'm good in that story, but I, I kind of don't believe
3345200	3346560	it anymore than a lot of stuff.
3347640	3348640	Is your mom still alive?
3348680	3349160	Yes.
3349240	3354520	Does she, and I first, I have to check a couple of things before asking you the
3354520	3357440	question, is she suffering from actual dementia or anything like that?
3357440	3357840	No.
3358080	3362160	So is she, is your, is your mom who's not suffering from dementia, but is just your
3362160	3368000	mom's age, is she starting to make shit up and redact and revise like memories that
3368000	3370840	you were pretty confident were like part of your canon.
3371120	3374600	And then like, you're, you're, you're an adult and you're visiting and you're like,
3374640	3379800	yeah, it's like that time that, uh, that soup got spilled or uncle Dave did this.
3379800	3383800	And my mom would just go like, the fuck are you talking about?
3384640	3386000	Uncle Dave was a war hero.
3386000	3387120	He never spilled soup in his life.
3387200	3390880	You know, it's like, what the fuck?
3390880	3391440	What is that?
3391480	3392800	Are you gaslighting me?
3392800	3394160	Like, what are you creating?
3394160	3395240	Like, who's creating?
3395480	3397520	My mom, like, I don't know what she's doing.
3397520	3399760	It feels like 36 hours with James Garner.
3399760	3402320	Maybe like, do I have the plans to D day and I don't know it.
3402320	3404120	And like my mom's you look it up.
3404120	3404600	Yeah.
3404840	3406040	No, my mother doesn't do that.
3406040	3413840	My mother, um, likes to consistently pretend, uh, like seeing a whole situation,
3413840	3419560	you know, decades in the, in the, in the, in the making of, of something that was
3419560	3423600	the dynamic that is not that I have to constantly remind her.
3423600	3424720	That's not the way that is.
3424720	3428800	And each time I'm disagreed with your mom will just say, well, the seventies were
3428800	3430320	all about potatoes.
3430600	3431880	Is that what you, is that what you're saying?
3431880	3437200	Or no, just like we were always happy go lucky.
3437240	3437840	Oh, right.
3437840	3438080	Right.
3438080	3439560	You know, that type of thing.
3439560	3440080	My mom.
3440080	3441400	Yeah, not true.
3441400	3442200	Not true.
3442200	3442560	Yeah.
3442560	3443520	Like that type of thing.
3443520	3447320	Yeah, I definitely inherited and I, this is actually to my mom's credit to the
3447320	3452000	existence that I like myself, but like my personality is very much like, I know I have
3452000	3453360	to catch myself.
3453560	3461840	Like my mom and I love explaining everything like shit that is none of our fucking
3461840	3462320	business.
3462320	3463880	Like there's nothing at stake for us.
3463880	3470120	We just have to every, you get like a napkin, a manufacturer could cut, could introduce
3470120	3473880	himself to me and say, uh, or herself, you're welcome.
3474200	3475400	Whoa.
3475680	3476480	Yes, that's right.
3476480	3478600	Women can be napkin manufacturers.
3479480	3481880	Swallow it down, Nazis.
3483120	3486160	And themselves, why are you still buying tickets to my show?
3486160	3487080	You're Nazis.
3487360	3494360	Um, and themselves, you know, but the, um, the, the, within five seconds, like the napkin
3494360	3496440	manufacturer would say, I'd go, how's business?
3496440	3500760	And they would say like, like, uh, it's actually, it's been up and down lately and I
3500760	3503600	would be like cutting the person off and going like, well, yeah.
3503600	3504800	Cause I can wipe in your mouth.
3504800	3506280	It's like kind of a zero sum game.
3506280	3510240	I know it's like, like, I got that from my mom.
3510240	3511600	My mom is great at it.
3512080	3512880	I'm great at it.
3512920	3514720	It's not a great thing to be great at.
3514760	3515520	It's awful.
3515680	3516920	It's a horrible habit.
3517760	3518000	Yeah.
3518000	3522160	My mother is, uh, one of the, I'll tell you what your mom is.
3522160	3527480	And I'll tell you what all moms are.
3530160	3536280	Moms on the line, pay them a dime, give them a nickel, a penny or two.
3536320	3537320	That's 12 cents.
3537400	3538280	What you're going to do.
3540400	3544520	A wrap-in went to the zoo, went to the museum.
3544640	3545480	Fuck your mama.
3545680	3546640	How do you see them?
3546760	3547120	Big.
3548960	3550280	Why do you see them big?
3550400	3550680	Yeah.
3550680	3550880	Yeah.
3552960	3554920	Wait, don't ask any questions.
3555280	3557840	Wait, who's um, talk to your mom up.
3557880	3559440	How do you see them big?
3560320	3560800	Okay.
3560920	3562160	It's a, it's a feature.
3563000	3566400	It all was very clear to me until post.
3566400	3567400	I fucked your mom up.
3567520	3567880	Sure.
3568320	3571920	But if I just yell out DJ Khaled randomly, I'm a genius.
3571920	3575720	Say, come on, raps rapping is idiosyncratic.
3575840	3577200	How do you see them big?
3577480	3579360	I'm not saying it's not good.
3579360	3581320	I'm just saying I'm interested in what it means.
3581320	3583040	Okay, I'm here with the author.
3583040	3584800	So I was just like, I'm a little defensive.
3584840	3585520	I'm a little defensive.
3585520	3586400	I mean, I am too.
3586440	3587040	I am too.
3587040	3588600	I'm totally a defensive person.
3588640	3590800	I hope I'm not speaking out of school.
3590800	3593760	You, you've engaged in rapping, haven't you?
3593960	3595280	Yeah, I did.
3595560	3596040	I did.
3601560	3605120	Yeah, I didn't, I did not mean that when you're in your 20s and you think you're,
3606320	3607680	I'm not a good freestyler.
3607680	3611120	Look, I, yeah, I did this thing called cracked out for quite a while.
3611120	3612360	That was like me and John Daly.
3612600	3613480	That was our thing.
3613880	3614480	What was it?
3614720	3615760	I'm not familiar with it.
3615840	3617440	Oh, it was, it wasn't improv though.
3617440	3619920	It was like, no, it was, it was scripted.
3619920	3623320	I mean, it was like very, very, uh, it was problematic.
3623320	3625520	I would, I would not do it again.
3625520	3631320	It was very, uh, very privileged and short sighted and near sighted.
3631800	3635360	Uh, yeah, we would like, we would do these rapper characters named cracked out
3635360	3642040	and rapzilla and what performed pretty like misogynist, uh, songs.
3642040	3646600	Cause our whole like justification for it was that we loved hip hop and we were
3646600	3650640	sick of people like doing rapper care, white rapper, you know, white comedians
3650640	3655680	doing rappers and like just playing on the like cliche tropes, like let's create
3655680	3663680	two characters who really embody the flaws of like co-opting this music and, uh,
3663680	3667600	and this culture and then, but it was just an excuse to act like a couple of
3667600	3671000	assholes, it was so hypocritical and like shitty.
3671000	3676400	No, we did like, uh, and then we wear like, you know, like G unit shirts and
3676400	3677240	do regs and shit.
3677240	3678800	It was just, it was not cool.
3679680	3682880	It was very pre 2018 everyone.
3683240	3684080	No, yeah, no.
3684080	3689440	I, you know, I kind of want to feel like, uh, we should hear you guys
3689440	3690560	both freestyle right now.
3690880	3691840	We would be terrible.
3691840	3693240	We were not like, it was not great.
3693240	3697800	We tried to rap as, as Zach, you got, you got a beat for us rhyme as well as we
3697800	3700680	could. Oh, both of us were, you and me.
3700720	3701280	Okay.
3701280	3702520	He didn't hear you explaining.
3702800	3703640	I think he did.
3703640	3706040	I think he just, just did not care.
3706280	3706760	Yeah.
3707880	3712320	Well, yeah, it's so, it also like it's lame, you know, to, to, to, no, we were just
3712320	3714560	doing that and then that was like what we were known for.
3714560	3715880	We were like, we should stop this.
3715920	3721640	Not because it was, uh, ignorant in any way.
3722200	3722720	Yeah.
3722880	3727160	Because it was comedically like, well, you cross the threshold, you know, and it was,
3727160	3729680	of course, like white people loved it.
3730760	3733720	Is there anybody here in the crowd that feels like they're a good freestyling?
3733720	3735800	Like, like, like they can come up and throw it down.
3737080	3738000	Oh, shit.
3738000	3739800	We got, we got, we got one confident.
3739800	3740080	Yes.
3740080	3741280	Just who's that?
3743400	3744400	Oh, no.
3745080	3748400	And I'm going to, yes, seated next to someone.
3748680	3749960	Against white rappers.
3749960	3752280	I'm not saying every white rapper is like.
3752280	3756400	A woman, a woman, a woman, no, it's definitely fraught.
3756440	3762040	I felt like it was, is it my perception or the person that went that very quickly
3762040	3769680	went, yeah, was sitting next to the date who then went, no, I have to, these people
3769680	3771480	don't have to get in a car with you.
3771480	3772360	I would love it.
3773920	3775560	Is there a gal here tonight?
3775560	3777160	Is there a woman that can free show?
3777360	3778800	No, wait, what?
3778880	3784880	No, I thought your theory was right where she went, no, like she was dissing him from
3784880	3789240	the perspective of someone who could really rap and knew the true extent of his rapping
3789240	3793080	capabilities and was casually slagging him off.
3793080	3793440	Yeah.
3795280	3796680	Well, that's a fair assessment.
3796680	3797920	That may well be the case.
3797920	3800880	If that's the case, they both have to come up here and rap.
3801600	3803920	You're like my, my Jiminy Sobriety cricket.
3803920	3810960	Like I can't, halfway through the show, I'm so drunk that when Jim throws me for a
3810960	3814600	loop, I don't even know how to articulate it as fast as you can.
3814600	3815720	I barely.
3817520	3818720	I'm just figuring that out.
3818760	3822280	I was just fantasizing that there would be a woman out of the crowd that wants to come
3822280	3823640	up and freestyle rap with that too.
3823640	3824000	That would be great.
3824000	3824760	Don't get me wrong.
3824800	3827600	Yeah, it'd be as good as if a guy or anybody.
3827600	3828720	I think it would be better.
3828960	3832040	But all of it, all of it might be bad.
3832040	3832640	We don't know.
3833560	3838240	Anyway, anyways, Brett Gelman, what are you what are you excited about working on right
3838240	3839000	now?
3839200	3841000	Yeah, what's your new eagle heart?
3842000	3847120	Wait, when you're not rapping with women, what am I going to start rapping with women?
3847840	3851720	When maybe I should do that when you're not rapping with women, what are you working on?
3852240	3860320	Ah, well, when I'm not rapping with women, which I never am.
3860880	3862400	Thank you for taking the break.
3862440	3865200	No, I actually actually started rapping again.
3865200	3868320	But with the more pointed, you know, women.
3868400	3868760	Huh?
3868840	3869200	Oh, no.
3871200	3876760	I don't have I don't it's it's a solo, you know, you know, but my girlfriend will.
3877000	3879600	But it's it's it's helping me write it.
3879600	3887800	Are you like recording a mixtape or I don't know what I think it'll be an EP and then
3887800	3893640	hopefully and there'll be comedy on that on there, too, you know, and the songs probably
3893640	3896760	will be comedic and they'll send it to like somebody and they'll be like, oh, my God,
3896760	3897640	this is fucking great.
3897640	3904080	I'll pay you like twenty million dollars to fill this out and make it longer, which is
3904080	3907120	something that's always happens, especially in those terms.
3907120	3908920	You know, people always want it longer.
3909280	3917640	They know I'm I'm on this in this movie Room for Rent that is is going to be coming out.
3918080	3923080	And, you know, I'm in that and then like been shooting while I'm in this show called
3923080	3925720	Camping, which just premiered on HBO.
3927560	3928240	Thank you.
3929440	3932960	I just shot the second season of this great show called Fleabag.
3932960	3933840	I don't know if you've seen that.
3934560	3936680	That that that I've been hearing.
3936680	3939320	Oh, my girlfriend's like way into that.
3939320	3940600	Yeah, and I keep on.
3940600	3942000	I also haven't seen Atlanta yet.
3942000	3945920	So don't be offended when I say I've been hearing for a year and a half that it's great.
3945920	3946920	And you're very busy.
3946920	3947680	You're very busy.
3947680	3948880	No, not at all.
3948880	3949440	I'm not.
3949440	3950280	I'm not a net.
3950280	3953760	I'm on level 80 of my fourth Fallout 4 replay.
3953760	3954480	I am not.
3954480	3957720	I there's no excuse for me not watching people's shows.
3957720	3960640	I just don't do it for some fucking reason.
3960640	3963720	I don't know if it's pettiness, jealousy, laziness.
3963720	3964800	What what is it?
3964800	3966520	Why don't I watch other people's shows?
3966520	3969520	Maybe because you're you spend a lot of time working on a show.
3969520	3973520	You don't feel like watching like shows that are coming out while yours is coming out.
3973520	3974800	I think it's my last.
3974800	3983320	Yeah, because the muscle in your brain that is dedicated to appraisal of whether something's funny, maybe,
3983320	3988600	is so overactive that you don't want to like someone says, you know, it's amazing.
3988600	3989600	You should like if you were.
3989600	3993200	Yeah, it's like you should run to this class I'm doing where we crunch this muscle.
3993200	3999840	And you're just like it's a muscle that you like that you you you've been shooting like steroids into.
3999840	4001800	And you're like, I'm going to kill a child.
4001800	4002200	Right.
4002200	4003400	Go to that class.
4003400	4005600	I don't know what I do is think about this muscle.
4005600	4006800	I don't know how to explain it.
4006800	4008000	I just observe my behavior.
4008000	4008800	I go, right.
4008800	4015600	Why why at this point aren't you like I I saw an episode of BoJack and I was like, this is awesome.
4015600	4018800	Like clearly I can see I can see what all the hubbub is about.
4018800	4020600	I've never been jealous of BoJack.
4020600	4021800	I've never wished ill.
4021800	4024400	I'm like all my friends are on it.
4024400	4029300	I just but I still haven't like been binge watched BoJack, which Cody has.
4029300	4033000	Therefore, I caught a couple episodes and right I said, I go, oh, that's great.
4033600	4035600	Why did I watch all of Eagle Heart?
4035600	4036200	Why?
4036200	4041000	What was I like not threatened by it because you had due to because it was so unsuccessful.
4043400	4045200	To have ownership is fucking great.
4045200	4046200	Nobody's watching it.
4046200	4047400	Oh god, I love it.
4047400	4052200	I don't it's got quality and no audience perfect combo for me.
4052200	4055400	Yeah, no, I I don't know.
4055400	4057900	Yeah, I don't always feel like watching things.
4057900	4062900	It can become it's also like a lot always is just being is airing and being like, oh,
4063000	4063800	you got it.
4063800	4066800	I mean, that's how so many conversations start these days.
4066800	4068900	Oh, you got to watch this.
4069300	4075800	I think it's just a I think it's it's an it's an expression of my workaholism,
4075800	4078200	which is not has nothing to do with work ethic.
4078200	4081000	It's relationship with what I consider work.
4081000	4091800	And so it's like I yeah, I'm like it's yeah, my colleagues are suffering the symptom of me having an unhealthy
4091800	4093500	relationship with what I do.
4093500	4094000	Mm-hmm.
4094000	4100600	It's not because it's not about competition or anything as much as it's like I'm like I have some aversion.
4101000	4103800	I want to get away from my own work as soon as possible.
4103800	4109700	And then I like somehow categorize watching New Girl with my own job,
4109700	4111600	which I shouldn't have anything to do with that.
4111600	4112100	Right.
4113300	4114100	New Girl.
4115500	4121700	He said as an example because I should have bonded with like Liz Merryweather and like we had shows
4121700	4126000	out at the same time and it was like like shit like I was like,
4126000	4129300	why am I not watching your show and then like I would see a couple episodes
4129300	4133400	because my ex-wife McGathey would be watching New Girl and I was like,
4133400	4135800	I'd walk through the room and oh, oh, that's New Girl.
4135800	4137100	Yeah, it's delightful.
4137100	4137800	I like that.
4137800	4138800	No, it's a great show.
4138800	4140800	No, I just know I wasn't dissing the show.
4140800	4142400	No, I know you weren't dissing it.
4142400	4142900	Jesus.
4144100	4146000	Why don't I get excited?
4146000	4151400	Why do I like on my fifth rewatch of my ninth season of Forensic Files?
4151400	4156700	Like I'm just like like I just just like rape and murder and this is like the give me the true crime
4156700	4160600	and the fucking like I'm just like in this crazy like I'm a void.
4160600	4161500	It's avoidance.
4161500	4162700	It's avoidance of something.
4162700	4163500	You think so?
4163500	4165000	I don't watch comedies.
4165000	4170200	Like I have no desire to watch like successful awesome like funny things.
4170200	4172700	I just they don't make me want to watch them.
4172700	4179600	I'd rather watch this stupid shit more than I would watch people that my friends like the shows my friends make.
4179600	4180100	Right.
4180100	4180600	Right.
4180600	4188500	And it's not out of I don't think it's jealousy or like like like distancing myself in that it's like I think like I don't want to watch it come.
4188500	4191100	Well, I think like maybe maybe it's and I can relate.
4191100	4197100	I do watch things that my friends make but I sometimes don't feel like and there is like an aversion.
4197100	4202700	I think it's just because it's all so close to you and even though this is our job,
4202700	4208200	we still relate to everybody that you want to when you watch something escape your life.
4208200	4215100	So this these things that are close to you by your friends are maybe making you guess not able to escape your life as much.
4215100	4223100	I guess I don't know something to do with engagement to that because I don't think it's honestly not always like oh my friend worked on this or this is the same genre even.
4223100	4225100	It's like something to do with engagement.
4225100	4225600	Uh-huh.
4225600	4233600	I think it's like like I I pay too much attention to act breaks or genre or something like that.
4233600	4235300	Right. Whereas in forensic files.
4235300	4244200	Yeah, like nonfiction spiral and like horror like horror doesn't come anywhere near anything that I have ever done for a living.
4244200	4247000	So I love horror movies and sci-fi.
4247000	4248900	You never want to write a horror.
4248900	4256200	I mean, have you never wrote a no, I've never written anything horror Monster House someone someone written.
4256200	4258800	You could you could hear in their voice halfway through it.
4258800	4259600	They regretted it.
4260600	4266800	They went they went monster a great film.
4266800	4271300	You know what great film but not a class not a horror.
4271300	4273700	Like a like a Stephen King.
4273700	4275600	Like yeah, like I'm trying to scare you.
4275600	4277600	There's an oogity boogity under your foot.
4277600	4278300	Right.
4278300	4280300	Like like I heard it's not sure.
4280300	4280600	Hold up.
4280600	4282800	This is Oogie Oogie Boogity under your snuggity.
4282800	4285800	Yeah, I think we found the title to your horror movie.
4285800	4286600	I think it's important.
4286600	4288000	I say I think this is important data.
4288000	4306800	Like if I'm if I'm flicking through Apple TV and if I see a thing so if I see cover art for a movie that's like a guy and he's got a hose coming out of his head and it says in like shitty Matrix ripoff font the happening to know I ripped a bad title.
4306800	4307600	That's distracting.
4307600	4308500	There was a happening.
4308500	4310100	So I made it to that doesn't help.
4310100	4329600	No, I was at the con the conduction and and all aboard the dark web or is that like you know what I'll barely have to read it's like like you know in a world where water is more valuable than metal computers just been brought online.
4329600	4338100	That's turns out to be part monkey and I'm just like I'm in I'm in I'm in is a horror sci-fi fantasy.
4338600	4362900	Even so it's like like and I but I know for sure any rom-com anything that's like anything near that any Apatow thing any like I'll I have to I have to be in the midst of a trade-off with Cody and then I'll always I'll always be like oh I love 27 dresses who would have known but I I don't know what it is.
4362900	4368100	What's the division like I don't want to be engaged on a maybe it's heartstrings.
4368800	4384900	I just I really I can't get out of my mind how much how I've really discovered one of my main like top dreams of my life and is that for me one one day to be sitting in a movie theater and see a preview for Dan Harmon's.

4739900	4740900	Yeah.
4740900	4742900	I just tried to literally follow his instructions.
4742900	4743900	Didn't sound like Benicio del Toro.
4743900	4744900	It did.
4744900	4745900	Give yourself some credit.
4745900	4747900	Did I sound like Benicio del Toro?
4747900	4748900	Yes you did.
4748900	4749900	Really?
4749900	4753900	Can I give you some instructions to do John Lithgow and see if my formula applies?
4753900	4754900	Okay.
4754900	4758900	Why don't we have a scene with John Lithgow and Benicio?
4758900	4760900	Well I'll be John Lithgow.
4760900	4761900	First I want to do a blind test.
4761900	4764900	Make your mouth into a circle like a lamprey.
4764900	4765900	Okay.
4765900	4766900	But no.
4766900	4768900	Tuck your lips under.
4768900	4770900	I can't talk while I'm doing it or I'll be doing John Lithgow.
4770900	4771900	Okay.
4771900	4772900	Yeah.
4772900	4774900	And then just just say go away.

4775900	4776900	John Lithgow.
4777900	4778900	That's great.
4778900	4781900	So should I do John Lithgow when you do Benicio or other way around?
4781900	4782900	No.
4782900	4783900	I'll do John Lithgow.
4783900	4784900	Okay.

4816900	4817900	No.
4817900	4818900	It's not.
4818900	4819900	It's not good.
4819900	4820900	We're not going to.
4820900	4821900	It's really bad.
4821900	4822900	We need an A-list.
4822900	4823900	We need to have to rehearse this.
4823900	4827900	We need to get a Brad Pitt involved to help us out here.
4827900	4832900	Spencer, you want to throw some George Clooney on that?
4832900	4835900	We need an A-lister to make this story work.
4835900	4836900	Yeah.
4836900	4837900	That sounds good.
4837900	4842900	Oh, you meant an A-lister character, not an A-lister person doing the impression.
4842900	4843900	Yeah.
4843900	4844900	Oh geez.
4844900	4845900	What did you mean?
4845900	4846900	You're filled with as much shame as me.
4846900	4847900	That's what I thought he meant.
4847900	4850900	I don't think of myself in terms of lists.
4850900	4851900	Right.
4851900	4859900	Right, but my God, for you to hear that, that amazes me because that's a shame projection
4859900	4863900	that only I'm capable of where you heard that as I was like, yeah, this guy's not good enough
4863900	4866900	at improv for us to mount this amazing goal.
4866900	4871900	Oh, I thought that you just meant I wasn't famous enough to get away with doing a bad
4871900	4875900	impression, whereas if Brad Pitt were up here and he was doing a terrible Benicio impression,
4875900	4877900	he'll be like, I don't care, it's so amazing.
4877900	4882900	You guys are doing fantastic impressions of kind of second banana character actors.
4882900	4883900	We needed like an A-lister.
4883900	4885900	I was saying as the character.
4885900	4886900	Oh, okay.
4886900	4887900	I was saying as John was down.
4887900	4888900	Oh my God.
4888900	4890900	I was turning to Benicio within this.
4890900	4896900	Well, there we go again because I see Benicio and John as A-listers, but I guess they're
4896900	4897900	not.
4897900	4900900	I think they both did, and also so did the producer that put them on set.
4900900	4904900	How are they on set together in finding out that they can't carry the movie?
4904900	4909900	That was kind of my joke that they're both like, this isn't going good, is it?
4909900	4913900	I was blaming the fictional writer and producer of the movie.
4913900	4918900	But they themselves are such honest artists, I think that they would be able to admit that
4918900	4919900	it wasn't going well.
4919900	4920900	Right.
4920900	4925900	They'd be like, look, either this needs to be an indie movie about going on a road trip
4925900	4930900	or we need to add some talent.
4930900	4931900	Yeah.
4931900	4933900	It sounds like it's Jimmy Stewart.
4933900	4934900	Yes.
4934900	4935900	Jimmy.
4935900	4936900	Yes.
4936900	4937900	My child.
4937900	4938900	Let's go.
4938900	4939900	Sounds like Jimmy Stewart.
4939900	4940900	But there is similarities.
4940900	4941900	Yes, there are similarities.
4941900	4942900	There are similarities.
4942900	4943900	How about this?
4943900	4944900	How about this?
4944900	4950900	It's a story about, it's the biopic of Jimmy Stewart as portrayed by John Leskow.
4950900	4952900	And then Benicio plays Fernando.
4952900	4956900	And Benicio del Toro is strangely the star.
4956900	4959900	He's the A-story in the movie.
4959900	4960900	As who?
4960900	4961900	A manager.
4961900	4962900	As his manager.
4962900	4963900	His manager.
4963900	4964900	Okay.
4964900	4965900	So it's set in the 30s.
4965900	4966900	Great.
4966900	4970300	Like Jimmy Stewart is a, he's just, he's just James Stewart.
4970300	4971300	Right.
4971300	4973180	A bus boy.
4973180	4976380	And this is the scene where his manager notices him.
4976380	4977380	Benicio's older.
4977380	4983740	But Benicio del Toro plays the manager and John Leskow is portraying.
4983740	4987740	Benicio del Toro is playing Shell, Shell Superstein.
4987740	4989260	Shell Superstein.
4989260	4990260	Okay.
4990260	4991260	Shell Superstein.
4991260	4992780	Agent to the stars.
4993780	4999780	Young adult Jimmy, James Stewart's soon to be manager.
4999780	5000780	Right.
5000780	5001780	Right.
5001780	5002780	So it all plays out.
5002780	5006980	So you're, you're like, you're cleaning dishes in the, and I got Sherry's famous deli and
5006980	5013020	I caught your, I caught your, your vibe like Burt Reynolds did to Mark Wahlberg at Bookie
5013020	5014020	Nights.
5014020	5015020	And I follow you back into the kitchen.
5015020	5018780	But it's a young John Leskow playing a young Jimmy Stewart, right?
5018780	5019780	Yeah.
5019780	5020780	Or is it an old John Leskow?
5020780	5022420	Oh no, it's old John Leskow playing young Jimmy Stewart.
5022420	5023420	But that's not.
5023420	5024420	If it was filmed now.
5024420	5025420	If it was filmed now.
5025420	5026420	But I mean, what are we going to reverse age John Leskow?
5026420	5027420	Like what?
5027420	5033220	This is a, it's a Hallmark theater movie and like you're following me into the dish room,
5033220	5034220	like Burt Reynolds style?
5034220	5035220	Okay.
5035220	5036220	Yeah.
5036220	5037220	The dish room.
5037220	5040540	And I play, and I'm Benicio del Toro as Shell Superstein.
5040540	5043940	There is a dish room I worked in it for my young adult life.
5043940	5044940	Jesus.
5044940	5050900	I'm sorry to blue collar high road you, but the dish room is a pretty real place.
5050900	5055180	I think every dishwasher now feels better by hearing it called dish room.
5055180	5058060	Well, here we go.
5058060	5060540	Washing these dishes that I.
5060540	5061540	Hey.
5061540	5063540	Hey, boy chick.
5063540	5067980	Hey, if you're going to be back here, you need to have a dish washing room.
5067980	5069900	No, no, no, no, no, don't be my sugar not here.
5069900	5070900	Don't be.
5070900	5071900	Don't be my sugar not here.
5071900	5073900	Stop your, stop your fetching.
5073900	5074900	Stop your fetching.
5074900	5075900	I'll flip you.
5075900	5076900	I'll flip you for real.
5076900	5077900	I know it's you.
5077900	5078900	I know it's you.
5079900	5080900	I know it's you.
5080900	5081900	I know it's you.
5081900	5082900	I'm sitting in a restaurant.
5082900	5085900	Gosh, nobody's ever noticed me.
5085900	5089900	Well, that's part of my job, kid, to notice people that aren't noticed.
5089900	5092900	And then I noticed them, and then everybody else notices them, too.
5092900	5094900	That's how I make stars, kid.
5094900	5096900	Well, it must be nice.
5096900	5099900	I sure like to get paid to notice people.
5099900	5100900	How would you like it?
5100900	5101900	How would you like it?
5101900	5102900	How would you like it?
5103900	5105900	If I made that sweet little tuckus of yours,
5107900	5110900	the most famous tuckus in the whole world, huh?
5110900	5111900	Oh, Jesus.
5111900	5115900	One of the most famous tuckus is ever to shake itself across the silver screen, kid.
5115900	5117900	How would you like that, boy chick?
5117900	5118900	Oh, gosh.
5118900	5123900	She might as well ask me if I want my tuckus to make ice cream.
5123900	5125900	Of course I'd love it.
5128900	5131900	I mean, I'm going to, well, I'm going to refuse the call now,
5131900	5135900	but then I'm going to have an argument with my mother in a second, in the next beat.
5135900	5137900	No, I talked to your mother for now on.
5139900	5143900	Well, I'm only saying no now for the sake of story.
5143900	5144900	Oh, okay.
5144900	5146900	I'm not doing bad improv.
5146900	5150900	Later at the refusal of the call to adventure.
5150900	5151900	Hey, Mom.
5151900	5155900	Mom, I had the craziest encounter last night.
5155900	5158900	Oh, no, you didn't, you little poop.
5161900	5167900	Mom, this guy came in the dish room, see, and he told me I'm going to be a star.
5167900	5168900	No, son.
5168900	5171900	Mine is going to be a star.
5171900	5172900	Put me on the phone.
5172900	5173900	Put me on the phone.
5173900	5174900	Let me talk to your mother.
5174900	5175900	Let me talk to your mother.
5175900	5176900	Who the fuck is this guy?
5176900	5178900	Why did you let him into my home?
5178900	5181900	He wants to be on the phone with you, Mom.
5181900	5182900	Shalom.
5182900	5183900	Hello.
5183900	5184900	Shalom.
5184900	5185900	Hello.
5185900	5189900	I'm the threshold guardian, and I don't want my son to be famous.
5189900	5190900	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5190900	5191900	Let me correct you.
5191900	5192900	You were his guardian.
5192900	5195900	You're his ex-guardian, his ex-mother.
5195900	5196900	I am now his guardian.
5196900	5199900	I am now his mother.
5199900	5205900	He's that tuckus, that sweet little tuckus?
5205900	5206900	Just pretend it's dead.
5206900	5209900	Just pretend your son is dead, because he's as good as dead to you.
5209900	5211900	Later at the crossing of the threshold.
5211900	5216900	Whoa, I can't believe this party, Mr. Superstine.
5216900	5217900	Yeah.
5217900	5218900	What'd you call me?
5218900	5221900	I almost called you Benicio.
5221900	5222900	And Superstine.
5222900	5224900	Oh, no, no, no, no.
5224900	5226900	No, I'm a Jew.
5226900	5227900	I'm not Benicio.
5227900	5228900	Oh, gosh.
5228900	5230900	I've never even heard that name in my life.
5230900	5231900	Oh, no, I didn't.
5231900	5233900	You might as well say my name is Zarbot.
5233900	5234900	What?
5234900	5235900	It's something like that.
5235900	5236900	No, I didn't mean to imply.
5236900	5237900	No, no, no, it's fine.
5237900	5238900	It's fine.
5238900	5239900	It's a beautiful name.
5239900	5240900	I love your house.
5240900	5242900	It's actually one of the best names I've ever heard.
5242900	5243900	Oh, Super.
5243900	5244900	Benicio.
5244900	5245900	Benicio.
5245900	5246900	Oh, God.
5246900	5247900	If I could rename myself, I'd rename myself Benicio.
5248900	5249900	Benicio.
5249900	5250900	What would be my last name?
5250900	5251900	Not Superstine.
5251900	5253900	That's for damn sure.
5253900	5255900	Benicio Dell.
5255900	5258900	Look at all these people around the pool.
5258900	5260900	Oh, sorry.
5260900	5261900	No, it's fine.
5261900	5262900	It's fine.
5262900	5263900	No, no, no.
5263900	5264900	All these people are on the pool.
5264900	5265900	You know who they're here for?
5265900	5266900	Oh.
5266900	5267900	No, he introduced me to a one-by-one.
5267900	5268900	They're here to see you.
5268900	5269900	All right, well.
5269900	5272900	It's like a who's who of 19 Golden Age Hollywood.
5272900	5273900	All right.
5275900	5276900	This is David Oselznick.
5276900	5278900	Oh, hello, Mr. Oselznick.
5278900	5280900	David, say hello to the new star.
5280900	5281900	Hi.
5281900	5282900	Ooh.
5282900	5283900	Oh, my God.
5283900	5284900	Look at this guy.
5284900	5285900	Right?
5285900	5286900	What did I tell you?
5286900	5287900	What did I tell you, David?
5287900	5288900	What's your name?
5288900	5289900	Jimmy James?
5289900	5290900	What should we call you?
5290900	5291900	Oh, gosh.
5291900	5292900	My mom calls me James.
5292900	5293900	No, no, no, no, no.
5293900	5295900	You don't mention her.
5295900	5296900	Hey.
5296900	5297900	Hey.
5297900	5298900	You don't mention her.
5298900	5299900	Hey, kid.
5299900	5300900	Hey, kid.
5300900	5304900	He said that stepping into the hot tub with a young Jimmy Stewart.
5304900	5308900	From now on, I'm your mother.
5308900	5310900	I'm David Oselznick.
5310900	5312900	I'm your mom from now on.
5312900	5313900	I'm going to make you something.
5313900	5315900	Oh, is everybody my mother?
5315900	5316900	No.
5316900	5317900	I'm going to.
5317900	5319900	Because that's what Hollywood is.
5319900	5322900	It's the meeting with the goddess scene.
5322900	5323900	Here's the thing.
5323900	5324900	Here's the thing.
5324900	5326900	Notice how I didn't disagree with him, right?
5326900	5327900	That's right.
5327900	5330900	David Oselznick tells you that he's your mother.
5330900	5331900	He's your mother.
5331900	5332900	Oh.
5332900	5334900	Yeah, this party tells you that they're your mother.
5334900	5335900	They're your mother.
5335900	5336900	All right.
5336900	5337900	All right.
5337900	5342900	Basically, everyone who you're going to know from now on is your mother.
5342900	5347900	Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
5347900	5348900	70s needle drop.
5348900	5351900	I can't pay for the rights too.
5351900	5352900	Oh, sorry.
5352900	5353900	I can't remember it.
5353900	5354900	Some Santana song.
5354900	5360900	Oh, boy.
5360900	5364900	Who's this over here?
5364900	5368900	Another classic silver screen legend.
5368900	5370900	In the 70s?
5370900	5371900	No, no.
5371900	5373900	I was just boogie night reference.
5373900	5374900	Oh, right.
5374900	5375900	Well, we're melding the period.
5375900	5376900	It's a mess.
5376900	5377900	Yeah, no, I got to know.
5377900	5378900	It's good.
5378900	5379900	It's good.
5379900	5380900	You can do that.
5380900	5381900	They did.
5381900	5382900	I thought glorious bastards.
5382900	5383900	Yeah, exactly.
5383900	5384900	It's about popcorn.
5384900	5385900	It's not about.
5385900	5386900	Yeah.
5386900	5389900	If you want to get a documentary, get one.
5389900	5390900	Yeah.
5390900	5394900	But really, one of my name really was Benicio.
5394900	5395900	Anyway.
5395900	5396900	All right.
5396900	5397900	Well, look.
5397900	5398900	Oh, is that over there?
5398900	5399900	Who's that?
5399900	5400900	Oh.
5400900	5401900	Oh, this right here.
5401900	5402900	Are you talking to me?
5402900	5403900	Oh, my gosh.
5403900	5404900	This right here.
5404900	5405900	This is.
5405900	5406900	Francis Capra?
5406900	5407900	Francis.
5407900	5408900	It's Frank.
5408900	5409900	Francis Capra.
5409900	5410900	I'm Frank Capra.
5410900	5411900	Oh, Capra.
5411900	5412900	I thought you said Cochran.
5412900	5413900	I got very.
5413900	5414900	I got very confused.
5414900	5416900	You know, this is this is Frank Capra.
5416900	5417900	The one and only.
5417900	5418900	Oh, boy.
5418900	5419900	Oh, you're going to do.
5419900	5421900	I know you guys are going to do a lot of wonderful things together.
5421900	5424900	A lot of wonderful, very light light things.
5424900	5429900	Only if he fucking sucks it.
5429900	5430900	I'm Frank Capra.
5430900	5431900	You got to suck it.
5431900	5432900	Oh, boy.
5432900	5434900	You got you got to slap it right on.

5438900	5439900	And then.
5439900	5440900	Why not?
5440900	5442900	Only if you really just lay it down there.
5442900	5445900	I'm going to stand on the edge of the pool and jump in.
5445900	5448900	I don't want to commit fellatio.
5448900	5451900	I don't want to have any kind of career at all.
5451900	5456900	You have the opportunity to do a very, very, very progressive thing here in this.
5456900	5457900	Hey.
5457900	5458900	Hey.
5458900	5459900	This shouldn't be a moment of shame.

5461900	5462900	Yeah.
5462900	5463900	Why don't you fucking cool it?
5463900	5465900	That was my Frank Capra test.
5465900	5468900	I don't want somebody that wants to suck it to get a job.
5468900	5473900	I want somebody who has the integrity to work in this town for the right reasons.
5473900	5475900	This is what I was saying to you, Frank.
5475900	5476900	I'm always in on this bit.
5476900	5478900	And you always think that I'm, I'm interrogating you.
5478900	5481900	You always forget what I, I was in on.
5481900	5483900	I was doing the thing there, Frank.
5483900	5484900	No, no, no, no.
5484900	5485900	What are you?
5485900	5486900	I pull Superstain.
5486900	5489900	I pull Superstain aside and go, no, we're doing, I'm doing that.

5505900	5506900	We're merging periods.
5506900	5507900	What do you think?
5507900	5508900	You ever watch the Goldbergs?

5511900	5512900	What the fuck?
5512900	5524900	There's a central theme to many, many things that the, the, the, the, the screen that nowadays

5537260	5539980	It's, it's, uh, it's Betty Hutton.
5539980	5540980	Oh wow.
5540980	5541980	Betty Hutton.
5541980	5543980	You got to meet her.
5543980	5544980	Come on.
5544980	5545980	Come over here.
5545980	5546980	Wow.
5546980	5550660	I would be remembering her for a long time.
5550660	5552500	I didn't think anyone could do an impression of her.
5552500	5555340	I just thought you would all be interested to know that Betty Hutton was standing over
5555340	5556340	there on the other side.
5556340	5558100	No, you don't want to talk to Betty Hutton.
5558100	5559100	We're not going to talk to Betty Hutton.
5559100	5560100	You don't want to be Betty Hutton.
5560100	5561100	You got a brand new pair of roller skates.
5561100	5562100	You got a brand new key.
5562100	5563100	Oh, Betty Hutton's on roller skates.
5563100	5564100	This is because it's buggy night.
5564100	5565100	Right.

5568100	5569100	Yeah.
5569100	5570100	But they didn't have keys.
5570100	5571100	They won't have keys until the seventies.
5571100	5572100	Oh, okay.

5597860	5598860	Or what?
5598860	5601860	I thought, I thought you don't want, I thought you wanted him to keep his integrity.
5601860	5602860	No, I don't.

5646460	5647940	It's been decades of...

5652580	5657380	I just, you know, this whole method acting thing that you're doing with me at a party.
5657380	5660180	Look, I'm just trying to make motion pictures of it.
5660180	5661180	No, you're not.
5661180	5662180	You know, you're not.
5662180	5665460	You're trying to alienate people, including yourself, and I think it's very sad.
5665460	5670140	I'm trying to create an America that is a mythological America that never really existed.
5670140	5674620	I want to bring people together.
5674620	5675620	Superstar?
5675620	5676620	Yeah.
5676620	5680820	I'm going to suck your dick right now.
5680820	5682580	That takes a lot of guts.
5682580	5684300	Jimmy Stewart?

5685300	5687980	That makes me want to suck your dick.
5687980	5688980	Wait.
5688980	5689980	Why does it take a lot of guts?
5689980	5690980	To suck a man's dick?
5690980	5691980	Why does it take a lot of guts?
5691980	5692980	If you're straight, I guess.
5692980	5693980	This not really doesn't take guts.
5693980	5694980	You're making a decision.
5694980	5701980	Well, because it's 1936.
5701980	5702980	It's frowned upon.
5702980	5707420	The FBI can arrest you for it, still.
5707420	5709100	Oh, okay.
5709100	5710740	What period are we in again?
5710740	5713100	What year is this?
5713100	5716140	It's the gay scare period.
5716140	5717140	You know what?
5717140	5721460	Frank Camper, the only one on this picture who's playing games with my character's head.
5721460	5724140	You know who else is?
5724140	5725140	Mother Time.
5725140	5728060	No, not Father Time.
5728060	5729060	Mother Time.
5729060	5730060	That's right.
5730060	5731060	I said it.
5731060	5733060	Time, time, time.
5733060	5735060	See what's become of me.
5735060	5736460	It's 1930.
5736460	5737460	It's 1932.
5737460	5740460	When I look around for my possibilities.
5740460	5745660	Anyway, have you heard about this guy, Adolf Hitler?
5745660	5750540	I've been making this big ruckus in Germany lately.
5750540	5752660	I say let it sort itself out.
5752700	5755300	I don't like it when people get political.
5755300	5757460	I say make your movies.
5757460	5759300	Make season four of It's a Wonderful Life.
5759300	5761300	Why are you talking about politics?
5761300	5763300	Who cares?
5763300	5764300	Yeah, you're right.
5764300	5765300	You're right.
5765300	5766300	God, you're a star.
5766300	5767300	You really are.
5767300	5770260	I'm going to put a dick in my mouth.
5770260	5771260	Keep talking.
5771260	5774660	Talk all you want, but put something in my mouth.
5774660	5775660	Make it a dick.
5775660	5779660	Hey, Super Stank, can I pull you aside for a second?
5779660	5781780	Yeah, sure.
5781900	5784900	I'm having a second toss about this Jimmy Stewart guy.
5784900	5785900	Why?
5785900	5787900	He seems a little soft on Hitler.
5787900	5788900	La, la, la.
5788900	5791900	I wish I was talking a dick.
5791900	5793900	I'm in the background.
5798300	5799300	Look.
5799300	5801300	I'm soft on Hitler.
5801300	5802300	Hard on dick.
5802300	5806300	Jimmy, let me tell you something.
5806300	5807300	All right.
5807300	5809300	Let me tell you something here, Jimmy, okay?
5809300	5811300	Let me tell you something, okay?
5811820	5813820	I don't like politics as much as the next guy,
5813820	5816820	but this Hitler guy, he's bad news.
5816820	5818820	Are you walking toward me while you're saying that?
5818820	5819820	Oh, hello.
5819820	5821820	Yeah, no, I ran over here to talk to you.
5821820	5823820	While you were screaming, I sprinted.
5823820	5829820	Oh, I was a gold medal sprinter when I was in high school.
5829820	5834820	Anyway, I'm telling you right now, this Hitler is a bad guy.
5834820	5838820	No amount of pleasure that you receive is going to make you
5838820	5844820	escape from the inevitable tragedy that this guy is going to wreak on the world at large.
5844820	5847820	Oh, geez, I just want to entertain the nice people.
5847820	5852820	I don't want to think about, uh, no, uh, uh, genocides.
5854820	5859820	Everyone, welcome to the party, Mr. Adolf Hitler.
5859820	5861820	Ba, ba, ba, ba.
5861820	5863820	Doin' chan, doin' chan, doin'.
5863820	5864820	Oh, God.
5865820	5868820	Apparently, it's from England.
5871820	5874820	You know, it was very influenced by the British Empire.
5874820	5878820	I understand there's a party going on.
5878820	5880820	Oh, God, Hitler.
5880820	5883820	There's a burgeoning Hollywood film after the year.
5883820	5885820	Oh, God, Hitler, what do you mean?
5885820	5888820	I, uh, I just came to have a good time.
5888820	5891820	Wait, just a bit of catch-up.
5891820	5893820	Who is who in this room?
5893820	5900820	I, I, I, I am the new chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler.
5900820	5901820	Oh, hello.
5901820	5902820	Who are you?
5902820	5905820	I'm, uh, Johnny.
5908820	5912820	I, I, I thought you were James Stewart, no?
5912820	5917820	Oh, wait, I, no, not, not, not the Nazi friendly actor Jim Stewart.
5917820	5918820	That's a different person.
5918820	5921820	I thought you were, you know who I thought you were?
5921820	5923820	I thought you were Errol Flynn, right?
5923820	5924820	Wasn't he a spy?
5924820	5927820	Well, I thought we were changing scenes with, uh, with, uh, with, uh...
5927820	5932820	Oh, a different party scene with, with Adolf Hitler and famous German Johnny.
5932820	5934820	I'm at the party now.
5934820	5935820	Oh, Hitler came to the party.
5935820	5936820	Hitler came to the party.
5936820	5937820	Okay, okay.
5937820	5940820	I thought we were cutting the fucking Hitler's house.
5940820	5942820	There are no changing characters now.
5942820	5943820	All right, sorry.
5943820	5944820	Everyone is who they were.
5944820	5946820	Wow, you thought we were cutting to Hitler's house, huh?
5946820	5947820	Yeah.
5947820	5950820	It's, it's, it's like, I'm a professional screenwriter.
5950820	5951820	No, no.
5951820	5953820	I'm like, this scene is 18 pages.
5953820	5954820	Right, no, it makes sense.
5954820	5955820	Like, where's the monster?
5955820	5956820	Where's the house, you know?
5956820	5957820	Okay.
5957820	5958820	I'm like...
5958820	5960820	So in this, in this...
5960820	5962820	Enough trick or treating, a little more...
5962820	5970820	Hitler gets announced by a German gibberish version of the British national anthem whenever
5970820	5971820	he enters his house.
5971820	5973820	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going, going, going.
5973820	5974820	Yeah.
5974820	5979820	That's his, that's his door, uh, his doorbell, uh, and he rings him whenever he opens.
5979820	5982820	It is totally, it is totally act three.
5982820	5986820	We are now in Germany and Jim Stewart is now very famous.
5986820	5987820	Oh, gosh.
5987820	5989820	I'm so glad to be Nazi famous.
5989820	5994820	I, uh, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm an enormous fan of your film work.
5994820	5995820	Oh, gosh.
5995820	5997820	I'm very, I'm very upset that...
5997820	6000820	Oh, Shel, you should have said something at some point.
6000820	6003820	You should have given me some career advice, for God's sake.
6003820	6004820	I don't know.
6004820	6005820	Tell me the name of your agent again.
6005820	6006820	What does his name say?
6006820	6008820	Shel, Shel Ruben.
6008820	6009820	Shel Ruben.
6009820	6010820	Shel Ruben.
6010820	6011820	Shel Ruben.
6011820	6012820	Shel Ruben.
6012820	6013820	Shel Ruben.
6013820	6014820	Ruben Shao.
6014820	6016820	Benicio Del Toro, right?
6016820	6017820	No, no.
6017820	6018820	Gurbel's Rubik.
6018820	6019820	Gurbel's Rubik.
6019820	6020820	Gurbel's Rubik.
6020820	6021820	Gurbel's Rubik.
6021820	6022820	Nice to meet you.
6022820	6023820	Can I?
6023820	6024820	Nice to meet you.
6024820	6029820	Let's share a name of the world, Rubik.
6029820	6030820	The human puzzle.
6030820	6031820	I'm Gurbel's Rubik.
6031820	6032820	Nice to meet you.
6032820	6033820	Very nice to meet you.
6033820	6035820	You know why they call him Rubik?
6035820	6037820	He's against mixing colors.
6037820	6044820	He thinks everything should be all the same.
6044820	6047820	All six sides of your DNA.
6047820	6048820	Oh, God.
6048820	6050820	He's a Nazi.
6050820	6051820	Yeah, that's right.
6051820	6063820	I pull Superstine, Rubik aside and say, your friend seems a bit racist.
6064820	6067820	He's kind of got the hang up about the mixing of colors.
6067820	6070820	I find that personally distasteful.
6070820	6071820	You're not?
6071820	6072820	You're not racist?
6072820	6073820	Huh?
6073820	6074820	You're not racist?
6074820	6075820	No, I'm not a racist.
6075820	6080820	I'm just a, you know, I'm a pragmatist.
6087820	6088820	A pragmatist?
6088820	6089820	No, I'm fucking with you.
6089820	6090820	I'm totally racist.
6091820	6097820	I almost went for that bait and told you I'm really a Jew.
6097820	6100820	No, we like to have fun here.
6100820	6101820	That's a Berghoff.
6101820	6102820	We like to have a good time.
6102820	6105820	Oh, that's good.
6105820	6108820	Wow, look at all these columns.
6108820	6109820	Yeah, nice columns.
6109820	6112820	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
6112820	6115820	You want things to look like classic architecture.
6115820	6118820	No, you sound like you're being ironic about that.
6118820	6121820	Yeah, look, I'd be lying if I said I wanted to, you know,
6121820	6123820	I thought I'd end up with this as my job.
6123820	6124820	I don't know.
6124820	6126820	I'm a big fan of neoclassical architecture.
6126820	6127820	What is the problem?
6127820	6131820	Yeah, I like washing dishes, but look how we end up.
6133820	6135820	I'm going to tell you, Mr. Hitler.
6135820	6136820	Can I ask you a question?
6136820	6137820	Mr. Stewart, can I ask you a question?
6137820	6138820	Go shoot away.
6138820	6144820	When you are in the death of liberty balance.
6144820	6145820	Who could forget that?
6145820	6146820	Right.
6146820	6147820	Oh, what a great picture.
6147820	6148820	We can all agree on something.
6148820	6149820	Right.
6149820	6151820	What was it like working with?
6156820	6159820	When you're in the death of liberty balance, what was it like working?
6159820	6160820	What's the great John Wayne?
6160820	6161820	I've always wanted to know.
6161820	6165820	Oh, gosh, you know, John is he's a real trooper.
6165820	6173820	And, you know, he liked to play practical jokes on the cast.
6174820	6179820	And I'll be gosh darned if he didn't.
6179820	6183820	I always tell you when you get the trailers, they have toilets in them.
6183820	6185820	But they tell you not to use them.
6185820	6188820	You know, there's no there's no water in them.
6188820	6189820	It's a dry toilet.
6189820	6191820	For God's sake, it's just the trailer.
6191820	6194820	The toilet's there in case it is hooked up to a sump pump.
6194820	6198820	I tried to get him a bucket of water, but they wouldn't budge.
6198820	6207820	John, Mr. John, he took a shit in my trailer and just ducked to the dry plastic.
6207820	6210820	And, you know, I had been forewarned.
6210820	6211820	Don't do that.
6211820	6216820	You're telling me he's a great John Wayne, took a shit in your honey wagon.
6216820	6217820	Yeah.
6217820	6220820	That's why they call him the Duke.
6220820	6221820	Dumb.
6222820	6223820	Stupid.
6223820	6224820	Stupid.
6224820	6225820	Because he took a dookie in your thing.
6225820	6226820	Because he took.
6226820	6227820	Yeah, I guess.
6227820	6228820	I don't know.
6228820	6229820	But it was a practical joke.
6229820	6231820	You took a shit in my dry toilet.
6231820	6233820	Jimmy, can I talk to you for a second?
6233820	6234820	Hold on a second.
6234820	6236820	I got to talk to my agent.
6236820	6237820	Excuse us.
6237820	6238820	So we got to get the fuck out.
6238820	6239820	What the fuck are we doing?
6239820	6241820	This is a goddamn Nazi Germany.
6241820	6242820	What the fuck's going on?
6242820	6247820	You said you wanted to try out your new comedy routine on a rough crowd.
6247820	6252820	I thought who rougher than the most evil person who ever lived.
6252820	6254820	You got to get me the hell out of here.
6254820	6255820	OK, all right.
6255820	6256820	I'll think of something.
6256820	6259820	Oh, gee whiz.
6259820	6261820	There's swastikas everywhere.
6261820	6264820	Even the cake is shaped like a...
6264820	6265820	Just be an actor.
6265820	6267820	I don't even know where to cut it.
6267820	6270820	I see you are enjoying my swastikas.
6270820	6271820	Oh, yeah.
6273820	6274820	Oh, we love them.
6274820	6275820	We love them.
6275820	6276820	They're wonderful.
6276820	6281820	Even to eat them is to be complicit in the deliciousness of fascism.
6281820	6282820	Yeah, yeah.
6283820	6287820	Actually, that symbol is used in some Native American iconography.
6287820	6288820	Oh, very good.
6288820	6289820	Very good.
6289820	6290820	Anyway.
6292820	6296820	So we are not so very different to me and you, Jimmy Stewart.
6296820	6297820	No, no, no.
6297820	6298820	Again, we can all agree on something.
6298820	6299820	Anyway, Chancellor.
6299820	6307820	Mr. Rubik, I have just got some information from my security team from the SD.
6307820	6309820	I've gone through your 23andMe.
6309820	6312820	It turns out that your name is actually Superstein.
6317820	6318820	Totally cool.
6318820	6319820	Totally cool.
6320820	6324820	He's referring to 1923andMe, which is unreliable.
6324820	6327820	It's conducted through a can with a string.
6327820	6329820	You can deny it.
6329820	6333820	Look, Mr. Hitler, that report, it's not true.
6333820	6334820	It's not true.
6334820	6337820	I had a whole thing with those people.
6337820	6343820	I was going to make the biopic on the genesis of 1923andMe,
6343820	6345820	but it all fell through and they blamed me for it.
6345820	6349820	So they've been trying to spread around that I'm a Jew, but I'm not a Jew.
6349820	6350820	My name is not Superstein.
6350820	6352820	They made all of that up.
6352820	6362820	My name is Gripples Rubik, and I don't like anything that's not white.
6362820	6365820	White, white, white, and more white, okay?
6365820	6367820	All white is all right.
6367820	6368820	All white is all right.
6368820	6369820	That's what I'm always saying.
6369820	6370820	We should get going.
6370820	6371820	Yeah, we got to go.
6371820	6372820	We got an Uber.
6372820	6373820	We bought an Uber.
6373820	6374820	Yeah, we bought an Uber.
6374820	6375820	Was that your idea?
6375820	6376820	Uber.
6376820	6377820	Uber.
6377820	6382820	Which there were every person who was named Uber in Germany at this time.
6382820	6384820	They drove taxis.
6384820	6386820	I've got an Uber good time here.
6386820	6387820	He's a special kind of taxi.
6387820	6389820	Personally, I don't like the Ubers.
6389820	6392820	I prefer the Liftwaffe.
6392820	6393820	Jesus.
6393820	6404820	We're just into a weird variety show sketch where making America fall in love with Hitler.
6404820	6407820	He's just a goofy character.
6407820	6410820	I like the Liftwaffe.
6410820	6412820	It's like the Benny Hill show.
6412820	6415820	All right, well, we got to get out of here.
6415820	6419820	It's important that we get out of here.
6419820	6422820	We got to do it back in America.
6422820	6425820	Proud Boys meeting.
6425820	6430820	We're very proud of us that we met you.
6430820	6431820	Proud of everything.
6431820	6432820	Proud to meet you.
6432820	6435820	You're going to hang out with the Proud Boys?
6435820	6437820	Oh, we love everything.
6437820	6439820	You know we call them here in Germany.
6439820	6440820	Regular boys.
6440820	6444820	No, we call them Deutsche Bags.
6445820	6448820	Hitler, you got to stop.
6448820	6450820	We're not franchising you.
6450820	6452820	I'm trying to have a good time.
6452820	6456820	We're on the risk of making you like Maguai from the Gremlins.
6456820	6460820	We're not into gizmo.
6460820	6465820	We don't want people to start to wear Harbuchad t-shirts that have Hitler on them smiling
6465820	6469820	and he's got to catch phrases that are fun to repeat.
6469820	6473820	It may be how this started in real Germany.
6473820	6477820	Probably started making fun of his hair and his mustache.
6477820	6479820	I didn't even invite you.
6479820	6481820	You guys just came to my house.
6481820	6484820	I thought, geez, we got to get out of here.
6484820	6485820	Let's get out.
6485820	6487820	You could have left any time you wanted.
6487820	6489820	We're taking the first Shepplin out of here.
6489820	6490820	We don't want to be rude.
6490820	6491820	We don't want to be rude.
6491820	6494820	We wanted to show you your due respect and whatnot.
6494820	6496820	Come on, I booked us on the Hindenburg.
6496820	6497820	Let's get out of here.
6497820	6498820	Oh, yeah, let's go.
6498820	6499820	Hindenburg.
6499820	6500820	That's too soon.
6505820	6507820	I got your first class tickets.
6507820	6508820	Here you go.
6508820	6509820	Thank you.
6509820	6511820	You didn't have to buy me these tickets.
6511820	6512820	It's very nice of you.
6512820	6513820	You've been a great agent.
6513820	6515820	I'm tired of this 10% nonsense.
6515820	6517820	I owe you my life.
6517820	6518820	I was washing dishes.
6518820	6520820	Now, granted, we took a bit of a detour.
6520820	6522820	I don't want to end up in Nazi Germany.
6522820	6523820	Of course.
6523820	6524820	I really don't.
6524820	6526820	But even here, aboard the Hindenburg,
6526820	6528820	at least I'm not washing dishes.
6528820	6529820	Right.
6529820	6530820	Sure.
6530820	6532820	As we go down in flames, yeah, we somehow survived.
6532820	6533820	Hey, come on.
6533820	6535820	Let's get this cocksucking blimp moving.
6535820	6537820	I don't care what it's filled with.
6537820	6539820	Fill it with something lighter than air.
6539820	6541820	I don't care what.
6541820	6543820	Just fill it with the first inert gas.
6543820	6546820	Well, then fill it with a non-inert gas.
6548820	6550820	Just fill it with a gas.
6550820	6553820	The first one you find on the periodic table.
6553820	6554820	Periodic table.
6554820	6557820	For God's sakes, these fucking krauts.
6558820	6560820	Hey, you have a cigarette?
6562820	6563820	Yeah, sure.
6563820	6564820	Here you go.
6564820	6565820	Listen, you krauts.
6565820	6567820	If you don't get this cocksucking blimp moving.
6567820	6568820	Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
6568820	6569820	What?
6569820	6570820	Stop it.
6570820	6572820	I'm sick of these notching pieces of shit.
6572820	6573820	You'll be very offensive.
6573820	6574820	Fill your blimp with a gas.
6574820	6575820	First of all.
6575820	6577820	The first one you find on the periodic table.
6577820	6578820	First of all.
6578820	6580820	I don't care how many electrons it needs.
6580820	6582820	Jimmy, you're phrasing, cocksucking is negative.
6582820	6583820	That's the first mistake there.
6583820	6585820	Superstein, how do you think I got where I am?
6585820	6586820	Suck and cock.
6589820	6590820	I'll tell you this.
6590820	6593820	Even more the reason you shouldn't use it in a negative way.
6593820	6596820	It's a positive thing to help you get to where your career is today.
6596820	6598820	You show me a society where you can admit suck and cock,
6598820	6599820	and I'll be all out in the open.
6599820	6602820	Until then, I've got to say, all aboard.
6602820	6603820	Choo!
6609820	6611820	This is Mr. Gufford.
6611820	6613820	I'm a famous radio historian.
6613820	6616820	I'm here at the lodge up of the Hindenburg.
6616820	6618820	Jimmy, wake up, wake up, Jimmy.
6618820	6619820	Wake up, wake up.
6619820	6621820	Wake up, Jimmy.
6621820	6622820	Wake up.
6622820	6623820	Jimmy.
6623820	6624820	Jimmy.
6624820	6626820	Oh, God.
6626820	6628820	Jimmy.
6628820	6630820	My shell, I had a horrible dream.
6631820	6633820	I dreamt I wasn't a star at all.
6633820	6634820	I was a Nazi.
6634820	6637820	You were there, and the Hindenburg was there.
6637820	6639820	I'm sorry.
6639820	6640820	I don't wake you sooner.
6640820	6642820	It's just you had a massive heart on,
6642820	6644820	so I thought we were having a pleasurable dream.
6644820	6646820	I didn't think it was a nightmare.
6646820	6649820	Anyway, I'm sorry.
6649820	6651820	Yeah, so it was bad.
6651820	6653820	It was bad, the dream.
6653820	6654820	Yeah, I mean...
6654820	6655820	But I was there.
6655820	6656820	Yeah, you were there.
6656820	6657820	I was there in your dream.
6657820	6658820	You were there, yeah.
6658820	6659820	I'm not important to you.
6659820	6660820	Oh.
6663820	6667820	Well, why do you think I'd invite you on this camping trip?
6667820	6669820	Why do you think we're all in the same tent together?
6669820	6671820	Of course, you're all important to me.
6671820	6672820	Shell?
6672820	6674820	Eight-all?
6674820	6675820	Right.
6675820	6676820	Let's get on this fucking carton.
6676820	6677820	It's gurples.
6677820	6678820	It's gurples.
6678820	6679820	It's gurples.
6679820	6680820	Oh, sorry.
6680820	6681820	Sorry.
6681820	6682820	Yeah.
6682820	6685820	God damn it.
6685820	6688820	I'm going to go get us some firewood.
6688820	6689820	All right.
6689820	6691820	Well, Adolph, look.
6691820	6695820	While he's getting a firewood, I got to level with you here.
6695820	6700820	I hope there's not going to be any alcohol in this party.
6700820	6701820	I'm teetotal.
6701820	6703820	I don't drink.
6703820	6705820	No, there won't be.
6705820	6706820	There won't be.
6706820	6708820	Just don't drink anything, though.
6708820	6710820	Do you know why I don't drink alcohol?
6710820	6711820	Why?
6711820	6714820	Because I am an angry drunk.
6714820	6716820	Oh, you're an angry drunk.
6716820	6720820	And when you're sober, you're not angry.
6720820	6721820	No anger, Wayne.
6721820	6724820	These days or any day recent tonight.
6724820	6725820	I'm feeling quite relaxed.
6725820	6728820	Is that Jimmy Stewart chopping wood over there?
6728820	6729820	Yeah, no.
6729820	6732820	He just said he went over to chop wood.
6732820	6735820	I got three logs.
6735820	6738820	I chopped down a tree and cut it into three logs.
6738820	6740820	I used space work.
6740820	6744820	But you'd have to subscribe to the podcast to know that.
6744820	6745820	There it is.
6745820	6748820	A backpack with three logs in it.
6748820	6750820	That should get us Susan Knight.
6750820	6753820	Say what?
6753820	6756820	I said that should get us Susan Knight.
6756820	6758820	Susan Knight?
6758820	6762820	Who's Susan Knight?
6762820	6763820	What?
6763820	6764820	Should I represent her?
6764820	6765820	Susan Knight.
6765820	6768820	I said that should get us through the night.
6768820	6769820	Oh, through the night.
6769820	6773820	I thought you said that should get us Susan Knight.
6773820	6774820	Well, my head's in the biz.
6774820	6775820	I'm always thinking of deals.
6775820	6779820	I thought for a second that maybe you guys were talking about some movie
6779820	6781820	collaboration together.
6781820	6784820	Well, I'm going to take one of these logs and rub it on the other two
6784820	6785820	and make some fire.
6785820	6786820	Oh, great.
6786820	6788820	A real man, a real American here.
6788820	6790820	Or I'm sure you can do it too.
6790820	6795820	Boy, this is harder than they make it look in the pictures.
6795820	6797820	Oh, you've never done it before?
6797820	6799820	No, I'm not doing it now.
6799820	6800820	It's not working.
6800820	6803820	I have to say, this is very good space work you're doing over there.
6803820	6806820	Oh, thanks, Hitler.
6806820	6808820	Why am I here?
6808820	6810820	Why am I here?
6810820	6811820	Why am I here?
6811820	6813820	Hey, no, no.
6813820	6816820	We need you here, Super Stein.
6816820	6818820	Rubik.
6818820	6819820	Look, we all know who you are.
6819820	6821820	Fine, fine, fine.
6821820	6823820	If you're all right with it, I'm all right with it.
6823820	6825820	Do you want to know my real name?
6825820	6826820	What's your real name?
6826820	6829820	Hitler.
6829820	6831820	We can all be friends here in this tent.
6831820	6833820	We can all camp together.
6833820	6834820	We can all have a good time.
6834820	6837820	It's just an agent from Hollywood and a famous to-be actor
6837820	6843820	and the potential dictator of Nazi Europe.
6843820	6846820	Oh, this is while you're still chancellor.
6846820	6848820	This is while you're still chancellor.
6848820	6850820	Oh, gosh.
6850820	6851820	Oh, no.
6851820	6852820	Oh, my God.
6852820	6853820	Oh, the fire.
6853820	6854820	What is happening?
6854820	6855820	The fire's too big.
6855820	6856820	The fire's too big.
6856820	6857820	Oh, my God.
6857820	6858820	How do we put the fire on?
6858820	6859820	Oh, God.
6859820	6860820	I hate to do this, but here.
6860820	6861820	Throw these books.
6861820	6862820	Don't get any ideas.
6862820	6864820	Throw all the books on the fire.
6864820	6867820	Books will put out the fire.
6867820	6871820	Why would you throw books on the fire to put a fire out?
6871820	6873820	Because they're really boring books,
6873820	6878820	and I thought it would lure the fire to sleep.
6878820	6880820	Oh, God.
6880820	6881820	Shell, wake up.
6881820	6882820	Shell.
6882820	6883820	Shell.
6883820	6885820	Oh, my God.
6885820	6886820	Shell.
6886820	6888820	Thank you for coming to Hermiton, everybody.
6888820	6889820	Oh.
6889820	6890820	Oh, that's it.
6890820	6891820	Wait.
6891820	6892820	What were you going to plug?
6892820	6893820	Oh.
6893820	6895820	Brett came to plug something.
6895820	6896820	Yes.
6896820	6902820	See room for rent and check out camping, everyone.
6902820	6906820	Brett Gellman, everyone.
6906820	6908820	Thank you, guys.
6908820	6911820	Spencer Crittenden.
6911820	6915820	And let's give it up for Zach on Sound and Nolan and Church
6915820	6917820	and Chris Borov.
6917820	6919820	Everybody here helping us out?
6919820	6922820	And the lovely dynasty typewriter.
6922820	6924820	I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis,
6924820	6927820	and your mayor, Dan Harmon, everyone.
6933820	6934820	Drive fast.
6934820	6936820	Take chances.
6941820	6954820	Did you get any of that?
6954820	6957820	It's a good show.
