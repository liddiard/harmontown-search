0	29320	Hello gang, this show is not brought to you by Bud Life.
29320	30320	It's good.
30320	39080	From somewhere near downtown, Los Angeles, the City of Angels and MacArthur Park, where
39080	51920	again the cake for some reason is melting in the dark, Carmen Town is now in session.
51920	65440	Spencer, motherfucking Crittenden, and the mayor of Harman Town, the one and only Dan
65440	66440	Harman.
66440	79440	Break your body, break your body down, break your body, move it all around, everybody,
79440	80440	everybody.
80440	86240	Okay, well that wasn't my fault, the song.
86240	88520	You heard that, the song hiccuped a little bit.
88520	92240	You gotta support me if you want to comport me.
92240	94740	Whoa.
94740	97120	Off to a bad start.
97120	99920	I don't want to be here either, thank you for coming.
99920	101720	I'm just kidding, I do want to be here, thank you for coming.
101720	102760	You want to be here.
102760	104160	How many shows left are there?
104160	107760	It's gonna be like six or something, I don't know.
107760	108840	What would you say Spencer?
109240	115720	I would say two plus four plus, I would say 15?
115720	117280	That can't be right.
117280	119160	That's a lot of shows.
119160	120240	That's a lot of shows.
120240	121240	That's terrible.
121240	123040	That's like, what are we, figure skaters?
123040	126240	But also we should have ended the show like a year ago.
126240	127960	Look at these fucking crowds we're getting.
127960	132360	I mean, there was like a good year or two, which is no one, yeah, we would have got our
132360	133760	asses in seats.
133760	134760	Yeah.
134760	136600	Well, a lot of people are making pilgrimages.
136600	142640	I mean, I just, I myself, I moved away from Las Feliz, so I'm not at the drawing room
142640	143640	as much.
143640	149720	I walked over there to meet, didn't walk over there, I, Dan, the details don't matter.
149720	153680	I went into the drawing rooms to catch an Uber with Jeff to the show, and there were
153680	157840	several people, shout out to my miscreants from San Diego.
157840	158840	Yeah.
158840	164560	I got, I got, I got, we got Little Bear and Gage out there, we got, who else, I got patched
164560	167280	into a Burning Man group.
167280	171600	I've never been to Burning Man, but if I go, I have a patch that I can iron on to the back
171600	172600	of my jacket.
172600	173760	I should probably stitch it on.
173760	175760	Little Bear and Gage, you out there?
175760	176760	Yeah.
176760	177760	All right.
177760	178760	Oh, hell yeah.
178760	181560	We got, we got Jen from Cincinnati, who was also at the bar.
181560	182560	She was there.
182560	183560	Jen, you with us?
183560	184560	Okay.
184560	189840	She's like a little quiet, Dave Klein, whoop.
189840	193960	And I also know, Jeff, you know, you're a big fan of my Instagram workout.
193960	194960	I am.
194960	196400	I trolled you all day today.
196400	197400	Yeah.
197400	198400	Whoa.
198400	200400	Is MLE805 here?
200400	201400	Whoop.
201400	202400	Whoop, whoop.
202400	203400	All right.
203400	204400	Whoop, whoop.
204400	205400	Yeah.
205400	207080	There's a lot of mini-Oopers out there.
207080	209840	A lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of people coming out.
209840	211480	They're like, oh my God, it's ending.
211480	215480	You think our crowds are big now because this is the dying Embers, this is the, the last
215480	216480	two wrongs?
216480	217480	Yeah.
217480	219440	Like, why would you, why would you go to something that was never ending?
219440	221200	Are you going to miss it when it's gone, Dan?
221200	222200	I'm sure.
222200	223200	Yeah.
223560	226560	But you'll be happy when it's over?
226560	228560	Yeah.
228560	233080	That's like the Sklar brothers have a joke that when you're, when something is bad,
233080	235280	your voice goes up when you're talking about it.
235280	236280	You're like, oh, was that good?
236280	237280	Oh yeah, it was great.
237280	240760	But if it was actually good, you're like, that was great.
240760	241760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
241760	249560	I was walking down the road in Washington, D.C. and I hear Jeff Davis and there's Randy
249560	252520	Sklar across the street from...
252520	255480	The twin high road us.
255480	257320	You say there was a Sklar.
257320	259540	No, but no, but here's the thing.
259540	267240	I had just five minutes before that was walking out of the elevator and I thought I saw a
267240	268240	Sklar.
268240	271560	And I was like, that guy looks a lot like a Sklar.
271560	275640	I'm not sure which Sklar, but also I'd order a Sklar profile.
275640	277600	You need to become a Sklar.
277600	281440	That guy could just be any guy that looks a little bit like a Sklar.
281440	284720	And then I heard Jeff Davis and it was Randy.
284720	289840	And I don't know why Randy's the one I know right off the bat, but the one that I saw
289840	291720	by the elevator was Jason.
291720	295800	And they had a show a block away from the hotel and they fucking killed it.
295800	296800	They absolutely slaughtered.
296800	301560	Okay, but to be clear, so you didn't know, you said you saw, I taught I saw a Sklar at
301560	302560	the elevator.
302560	303560	I thought I saw...
303560	308000	And the Randy story is he went, he went, Jeff, and you went, Sklar, and he was like, Randy.
308000	310280	And you left that out because you wanted people to think...
310800	311800	Can I be totally honest with you?
311800	312800	No.
312800	313800	Can I be...
313800	314800	No.
314800	315800	I don't know.
315800	316800	Can you?
316800	317800	Yes.
317800	321040	Let me be quite honest about this.
321040	327120	I thought there was a Sklar sighting, but it was in my really peripheral vision and
327120	328960	that just passed.
328960	335000	And then I was on the road and someone yelled my name out and it wasn't a real deal Sklar.
335000	336000	Right.
336000	339400	And I wasn't totally sure which one it was.
339400	340400	You just rolled the fucking dice.
340400	342400	And I walked in and I go, hey, what's up?
342400	345120	I said, I thought I saw a Sklar walker because, hey, you saw Jason.
345120	346120	Randy let me off the hook.
346120	347120	Oh, okay.
347120	348120	Right.
348120	349120	That's all you had to...
349120	350120	Yeah.
350120	351120	Okay.
351120	355540	But now I think after hanging out with them individually that night, I think you bring
355540	356880	any Sklar in here right now.
356880	357880	I'll fuck it.
357880	358880	Tell you which one it is.
358880	359880	Yeah.
359880	363680	I still can't tell the difference between the two guys that created HBO's Animals.
363680	366120	They worked in an office with me for years.
366120	368160	They're not related.
368160	371280	They just both had beards and I was like, guys, I'm sorry.
371280	373400	Only one of them wore glasses, but now it's a fucking...
373400	374400	Who knows?
374400	375400	That's the thing.
375400	376400	That was my trick.
376400	377400	But now they both wear glasses.
377400	378400	They both wear glasses.
378400	383440	And I think Randy is the one that is more likely to wear a plaid.
383440	385360	I think that's right.
385360	387360	I think Jason likes his solids.
387360	389520	Jason's a winter.
389520	394080	I can imagine if I were a twin and the other one started wearing glasses, I would after
394080	395080	a while.
395080	396080	I'd take them to dinner.
396080	397720	I'd be like, how's your wife?
397720	399360	Or your kids?
399360	401840	Are they identical to each other or me?
401840	405640	Anyways, enough about that.
405640	406640	What's with the glasses?
406640	409200	Are you trying to be the smart twin?
409200	410520	Is it okay if I wear glasses?
410520	413160	I would nip that in the bud.
413160	414160	Right.
414160	418280	I wouldn't mind any other gimmick, but if my twins started wearing glasses, I'd be like,
418280	420320	I'm allowed to wear glasses too.
420320	421320	Don't do that.
421320	423720	I'm not going to be the fucking Simon of these chipmunks.
423720	424720	Or wait.
424720	425720	No.
425720	426720	I'm sorry.
426720	429240	I'm not going to be the fucking Alvin.
429240	432200	I fucked it up.
432200	437200	What if one just started wearing a monocle, but then if I know the Sclaris, and I think
437200	441360	I kind of do now, they'll just fucking trade monocles.
441360	442360	Then you're fucked.
442360	443960	Well, that would be cool.
443960	449640	If you had a twin, I would do like a Zorax and Xenon or whatever those guys were.
449640	454560	One had a scar on one side of his face and the other had ... I'd be like, let's do that.
454560	456800	Then I got to remember which side the scar is on?
456800	457800	No.
457800	463000	No one does, but if someone had a scar on a different side of their face, you would
463000	466360	be like, oh, that's Randy for sure.
466360	467360	It would work.
467360	468760	You would think them unidentical.
468760	473280	I'm not going to enumerate what I think are the differences between them, but I think
473280	477320	I can totally nail who is which right now.
477320	481480	Jason used to be the one with glasses, and now they both got glasses.
481480	483440	Because Randy was like, what are you trying to pull?
483440	484960	I'm not the meathead's clar.
484960	485960	That's not how it is.
485960	489320	20 years later, he's like, I've had it up to here with these glasses.
489320	491440	All right, Sklars, Sklars, whatever.
491440	492440	You're off the hook.
492440	493520	You can go see them anytime you want.
493520	499160	They're never going to quit.
499160	500840	They're going to be here forever.
500840	501840	You're going to get sick of them.
501840	503320	They're going to ring your doorbell.
503320	504960	Me, I'm Salinger.
504960	507480	You're going to hunt me down.
507480	509040	Pay attention to me.
509040	510040	What I'm talking about.
510040	511040	You're talking about the Sklars.
511040	514640	All right, shut up.
514640	520320	When Harmontown is dead and dusted and all gone away, are you going to ever wish that
520320	525600	you had this platform, this microphone, this audience again?
525600	528600	Are you going to be quite happy that it's...
528600	531280	This doesn't seem that difficult to re-attain.
531280	538040	Do you think I'm being naive about that?
538040	541400	If anyone thinks I'm being naive about that, because I know that it would be naive if I
541400	543640	was like, well, I could just do it again.
543640	549800	Okay, so you're saying that if you ever wanted to do it, you would do it in some other format?
549800	551800	Or the same format.
551800	555720	It's just the cables that you plugged in, you plug them in again.
555720	556720	Check, check.
556720	557720	Hey, hello.
557720	558720	Well, we'll do-ba-do.
558720	562320	It's not that hard.
562320	566400	I never stapled a flyer to a telephone pole.
566400	567960	You make a couple TV shows.
568880	570840	People will show up.
570840	574440	Not as many as when you say you're not going to do it anymore.
574440	583160	Just ride this wave, finish up, it'll take six weeks.
583160	584160	Classic Coke, baby.
584160	586040	This motherfucker.
586040	588240	Always, always thinking.
588240	592080	I like to imagine that the audience, when they were laughing, they were laughing at
592080	593080	your audacity.
593080	594920	They're like, we're not going to fucking be here.
594920	596760	Are you fucking kidding me?
596760	600040	They're fucking out.
600040	602480	I mean, I'm sure they aren't, but it's fun to imagine.
602480	607800	Yeah, I hope everybody listening calls that bluff and nobody ever shows up again.
607800	614880	I always distracted because when we have a guest who I'm like, well, this is a guest
614880	620800	in a stricter sense, probably not a fan of the show, they're just a person that it would
620800	623280	be a delight to talk to.
623280	625520	This is their first time being here, they don't have anything about the show.
625520	629720	Then I listen to this first eight minutes of the show through their ears in the green
629720	632920	room and I'm like, why couldn't I be out there for this?
632920	636680	Why is it important that I be sequestered and then brought out?
636680	638200	The answer is, I don't know.
638200	643800	What is it that separates the guest part of the show from the non-guest part?
643800	646200	I like to think it eats up more time this way.
646200	648160	Yeah, it's probably true.
648160	650120	Maybe I'm warming you guys up.
650120	653560	I'm the world's worst MC.
653560	657120	They're back there going, thank God, I don't want to go out there cold.
657120	664160	Do some old-school Carson or Leno monologue bits.
664160	665160	What's in the news?
665160	669920	Turkey and Syria are in the news today.
669920	670920	What's going on?
670920	671920	Well, hold on.
671920	672920	Hold on.
672920	677840	Got to be something funny there.
677840	679880	Jeff's got a good idea there.
679880	681880	There's no internet here.
681880	682880	What do you want?
682880	686600	Like a musical lead-in?
686600	691400	Just freestyle some good old-fashioned topical humor.
691400	695120	Jack Benny, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno.
695120	699920	Okay, maybe it's like a...
699920	700920	Can it just be placeholder?
700920	702320	We're in a parallel dimension.
702320	703320	Sure.
703320	704320	Okay.
704320	707520	You just want the cadence of an opening monologue.
707520	713240	Tonight, and Joan Embry from the San Diego Zoo.
713240	716480	And here he is, Dan Harmon.
716480	717480	Right.
717480	730600	Picture a red curtain opening, Dan leans over and waves to the band, and here we go.
730600	732760	Thank you very much.
732760	736480	I know you were paid to react that way.
736480	737480	What's going on?
738440	741640	Wow, Ukraine madness.
741640	752560	I'm more familiar with the Ukraine now than I am my hometown, Jeff.
752560	755560	What's your hometown again?
755560	756560	Ukraine.
756560	759560	I wish I was gay.
759560	761080	So you could throw that to a room.
761080	764000	If there's a town in Ukraine, then it would be funny.
764000	765000	Yeah.
765000	766000	No, no, no.
766040	769760	And then you go and I go, Zelynsk, you know, and it's like, I've had chuckle.
769760	774320	I'm saying if you just said you forgot your hometown, you said it was the Ukraine, boom,
774320	776560	laugh, next joke.
776560	777560	So I fucked up.
777560	782160	No, no, no, no, you're nailing it so far.
782160	784160	So next joke.
784160	785160	Okay.
785160	787800	So just like, let's take it back.
787800	791400	I remember a real joke that Carson did that I never understood.
791400	792400	Okay.
793400	796560	And I want to do it.
796560	800200	This is a my I remember I was obsessed with Carson because I have dim memories of right
800200	802760	before Letterman like started.
802760	805320	And it was just like I was obsessed with Carson.
805320	807200	Then I immediately became obsessed with Letterman.
807200	812440	But like it was like I remember watching Carson and I was just a kid, it was just obsessed
812440	816900	with the idea of of like making people happy and like performing and things.
816900	819560	But I didn't understand any of the jokes.
819560	823600	And I was like, but I would then later I would understand the jokes.
823600	827640	I'd go, well, I understand that like Shelley Winters is famous for being fat.
827640	830320	I can figure this out.
830320	833040	We didn't have the internet, but there was like an encyclopedia, you could look up Shelley
833040	837640	Winters and say fat.
837640	838640	She didn't deserve it.
838640	840000	It was a terrible time.
840000	842040	Like, there was no shame.
842040	844840	And that included everybody like Academy Award running actress.
844840	848520	Yeah, it was like if you were a man that dressed like a woman, people would be like, oh, that's
848520	849520	hilarious.
849520	850520	And it was like problematic.
850520	851960	So we figured that out later over time.
851960	854480	It took an internet.
854480	856600	There was a show MASH and there was a character on it.
856600	859420	He dressed like a lady and it was like funny at everybody all the time.
859420	861520	Now he'd be brave and you would be an asshole.
861520	867800	All right, so anyways, this is the joke that he did.
867800	875440	He was like, he was in his model, like I said, boy, you know, there's been so much smog in
875440	877800	Burbank, but it's cleared up, Ed.
877800	879840	It's all cleared up.
879840	888480	So much smog in Burbank, but then it cleared up today.
888480	900520	There was a robin that saw it, was eating a worm and spit it out.
900520	901520	I was like, I don't understand.
901520	903560	Are you saying it's been so smoggy?
903560	907520	Is your joke how smoggy it is or is your joke how smoggy it's been?
908240	914320	It's been so smoggy that all birds in Burbank have never known they've been eating worms,
914320	915320	which they do all over the world.
915320	919160	Or that worms are notorious for eating smog.
919160	920560	Are you sure that's the joke?
920560	921560	Well, that's how I remember it.
921560	924080	I'm sure that that is the actual joke.
924080	925200	I can't be 100% sure.
925200	927680	Let's bring our guest out.
927680	929080	He's going to clarify everything.
929080	930080	He's German.
930080	931960	He's a YouTuber.
931960	935480	I wonder if YouTuber is like a point of offense for people at all.
935480	938920	Let's talk to him about that and more.
938920	946920	Please welcome someone who I was shocked to see how tall he was because it's just YouTube
946920	950240	and stuff, and then you just see a head, and then you're like, whoa, that head's far off
950240	952600	the floor.
952600	962120	Please welcome the illustrious, the talented, the intriguing Mr. Flula Borg.
965480	980920	Flula, pick a seat.
980920	982240	You can sit anywhere you want.
982240	983840	What's best for camera?
983840	984840	Interesting.
984840	986960	He chose the middle seat.
986960	987960	What does it say about me?
987960	988960	You know what that means.
988960	989960	Yeah.
989960	990960	Tell me Spencer.
990960	991960	Oh, boy.
991960	992960	No one ever chooses that.
992960	993960	Cool.
994960	997960	Were you talking about Tomax and Sam Ott?
997960	998960	Yes.

1018960	1019960	No, yes, and for Germans.
1019960	1020960	No, no, no.
1020960	1021960	Listen.
1021960	1022960	Never.
1022960	1023960	I tried it twice.
1023960	1024960	The third time, not twice.
1024960	1025960	Yes.
1025960	1026960	Sudetenland.
1026960	1027960	Yes, and.
1027960	1029960	That's a World War II joke.

1040720	1041720	Got it.
1041720	1042720	I thought that was like an insult.
1042720	1044720	Like, was I a has-been before I entered here?
1044720	1046120	So it's like, second career.

1052120	1053120	Yes, yes, yes.
1053120	1056560	I played with the G.I. Joes, the G.Joes, and also Mask.
1056560	1057560	You guys remember Mask?
1057560	1058560	Mask.

1060560	1061560	I'm a tank.
1061560	1062560	Yeah.
1062560	1063560	What was the theme of Suck the Mask?
1063560	1064560	I used to know it.
1064560	1065560	Mask.
1065560	1066560	Mask.
1066560	1067560	It's the something power.
1067560	1068560	Almost G.I. Joe.
1068560	1069560	Mask.
1069560	1070560	Mask.
1070560	1076560	We wish we were G.I. Joe.
1076560	1079800	It was basically like G.I. Joe, but not military.
1079800	1080800	Yes.
1081800	1082800	Check out those fucking drums.
1082800	1083800	No.
1083800	1084800	Add a laser.
1084800	1085800	Yeah.
1085800	1086800	Maybe Democrats have kids too.
1086800	1089520	Let's fucking like, these guys are financed by a philanthropist.
1089520	1090520	Oh.
1090520	1092160	I had to do the Dukakis tank.
1092160	1093160	Did you have that?
1093160	1096400	It was wonderful.
1096400	1099320	That is some fast fucking connection shit.
1099320	1103800	Not to ruin your joke by analyzing it, but that was, that was some lightning fast ethernet
1103800	1105520	fucking joke crafting.
1105520	1106520	Not a joke.
1106520	1107520	I actually had the Dukakis tank.
1107520	1110480	You just heard Democrat fucking thing and you were like Dukakis tank.
1111160	1112160	I'm sorry.
1112160	1116520	I followed the 1988 presidential election closely.
1116520	1117520	Who is it?
1117520	1118520	Who is Dukakis's running mate?
1118520	1119520	Oh yeah.
1119520	1120520	Monroe.
1120520	1121520	Earl Monroe.
1121520	1122520	Earl the pearl.
1122520	1123520	Wait.
1123520	1124520	Was it?
1124520	1125520	Lloyd Benson.
1125520	1126520	Lloyd Benson.
1126520	1127520	Fine.
1127520	1128520	Wait.
1128520	1129520	Wait.
1129520	1130520	Who was it?
1130520	1131520	Geraldine Ferrara.
1131520	1132520	Yeah.
1132520	1133520	Okay.
1133520	1134520	Yes.
1134520	1135520	Geraldine Ferrara.
1135520	1136520	I just wanted to know if he knew more about our politics than we did.
1136520	1137520	Earl the pearl Monroe.
1137520	1138520	Finger roll like a sucker.
1138520	1139520	But, but, but I didn't have to get hung up on my question, but I just want to know like
1139560	1144040	were you, were you like 10 years old in Germany, but into GI Joe?
1144040	1145560	Everything is very tardy in Germany.
1145560	1147960	We've just received Lethal Weapon 4.
1147960	1150160	So it takes a long, long time.
1150160	1154400	Is there, is there a funny title in German that I like when movie titles are different
1154400	1155400	in other languages?
1155400	1156400	Yes.
1156400	1157400	Would you like an example?
1157400	1158400	Yes, I would.
1158400	1159400	Great.
1159400	1160400	Yes.
1160400	1161400	So diligent.
1161400	1162400	Yes.
1162400	1163400	I fucking would.
1163400	1164400	My most favorite of the films is Die Hard.
1164400	1165400	Die Hard?
1165400	1166400	Starring Hans Gruber and Who Gives a Shit.
1166400	1167400	Right.
1167400	1174600	Does, does Gruber mean something in German?
1174600	1175600	Yeah.
1175600	1176600	Legend.
1176600	1177600	Jesus Moses.
1177600	1183200	It's just, it's when you get an SUV at Uber, it's like when you're, you're traveling with
1183200	1184200	friends.
1184200	1185200	All right.
1185200	1188600	Oh, to answer your question, Die Hard, in German Die Hard, which means would mean like
1188600	1190760	die with difficulty, which who cares?
1190760	1191760	Right.
1191760	1195080	So we have changed it to Steerplangsam, which means die slowly.
1196080	1197080	No.
1197080	1198080	Is that, is that, is that true?
1198080	1199080	Yeah.
1199080	1200080	I have the movie poster.
1200080	1201080	I took a photo of it.
1201080	1202080	Die slowly.
1202080	1203080	Would you like to see it?
1203080	1204080	I have the movie poster in my living room.
1204080	1205080	What?
1205080	1206600	He just, he just went to an Aztec fanny pack.
1206600	1211800	I just happened to take a photo and preserve it for a cultural recreation or whatever you
1211800	1212800	call it.
1212800	1213800	Yeah.
1213800	1214800	I mean, die slowly.
1214800	1215800	Die slowly.
1215800	1216800	Die slowly.
1216800	1217800	Steerplangsam.
1217800	1218800	That is really funny.
1218800	1219800	This is not planned.
1219800	1222800	I just take a photo of it every morning as I wake up.
1222800	1223800	Steerplangsam.
1223800	1224800	Steerplangsam.
1225520	1226520	Die slowly.
1226520	1227520	Die slowly.
1227520	1228520	Die skyscrapers.
1228520	1233000	Wait, is that, is that a command or is that something like, what if you just died less?
1233000	1238920	When spoken in German, it's always a command.
1238920	1241920	We don't have requests.
1241920	1242920	There's no I in team.
1242920	1245440	There's no requests in German.
1245440	1248680	Germany learned the hard way that if you ask permission, you just end up.
1248680	1249680	Twice.
1249680	1250680	Yeah.
1250680	1251680	Sorry again.
1251680	1252680	What was.
1252680	1253680	Oh, would you like another one?
1253680	1254680	Give me three million of them.
1254680	1255680	Okay, great.
1255680	1256680	Here's number one.
1256680	1257680	Okay.
1257680	1258680	Gorillaz.
1258680	1261440	Oh, do you have no, the Gorillaz in the mist with the lady and the monkeys?
1261440	1262440	Diane Fassie.
1262440	1263440	I think it was right.
1263440	1264440	Yeah.
1264440	1265440	Diane Fassie.
1265440	1266440	It was a Sigourney Weaver.
1266440	1267440	Yes.
1267440	1268440	Yes.
1268440	1269440	That one.
1269440	1273520	So if you say Gorillaz in the mist in German, it literally means Gorillaz in the manure.
1273520	1274520	Because mist means manure.
1274520	1275520	Yes.
1275520	1276520	Excellent.
1276520	1277520	So we have changed it.
1277520	1278520	Excellent.
1278520	1279520	We have changed it.
1279520	1280520	You're now German.
1280520	1281520	Rosetta Stein.
1281520	1282520	I like it.
1283520	1288240	Gorillaz in navel, we changed it, which means Gorillaz in the fog, which sounds like a weather
1288240	1289240	forecast.
1289240	1290240	Right.
1290240	1291240	Gorillaz in the fog.
1291240	1292240	Gorillaz in the fog.
1292240	1294000	I think I may have mentioned this in the show before.
1294000	1300360	I was in Italy and Hudsucker proxy was out in theaters and it was called Mr. Hula Hoop.
1300360	1301360	Yeah.
1301360	1302360	Spoiler.
1302360	1303360	Yes.
1303360	1304360	Holy shit.
1304360	1305800	We just need direct reasons.
1305800	1306800	Why should we watch this?
1306800	1307800	Hula Hoop.
1307800	1312120	In China, I think lethal weapon was called heavenly sounding cannon or something great.
1312720	1313720	That's a better movie.
1313720	1314720	Much better.
1314720	1315720	Yeah.
1315720	1316720	Yeah.
1316720	1317720	Heavenly sounding cannon two.
1317720	1318720	I'm into it.
1318720	1319720	Yeah.
1319720	1320720	Two cannons.
1320720	1321720	Two cannons.
1321720	1323640	How old were you when you left Germany?
1323640	1329400	I left as an adult who could vote and have beverages for adults, which I guess is 12
1329400	1330400	in Germany.
1330400	1331400	So I left after this.
1331400	1332400	Yes.
1332400	1333800	So your family moved.
1333800	1334960	You weren't like a runaway.
1334960	1335960	I was not a runaway.
1335960	1337560	No soul asylum for this one.
1337560	1338560	Yeah.
1338560	1339560	No.
1339560	1343040	I wanted to try to become a hype man for hip hop concerts.
1343040	1344280	So that's why I moved here.
1344280	1349480	And then I won a contest for hype men and then I stayed.
1349480	1353720	What is the ingredient for being a great hype man?
1353720	1356000	No understanding of anything.
1356000	1357680	Just you need to not know anything.
1357680	1358680	Yes.
1358680	1359680	Yeah.
1359680	1360680	Yeah.
1360680	1361680	Yeah.
1361680	1362680	Yeah.
1362680	1363680	Yeah.
1363680	1364680	Yeah.
1364680	1365680	Yeah.
1365680	1366680	Yeah.
1366680	1367680	Yeah.
1367680	1368680	Yeah.
1368880	1371920	And you can go boy, you can go girl.
1371920	1374240	You sometimes just be like, yeah.
1374240	1375840	I hate to put you on the spot.
1375840	1376840	Yes.
1376840	1377840	Fuck me.
1377840	1378840	Fuck me so hard.
1378840	1380840	Can you hype me if I like like.
1380840	1381840	Oh yeah.
1381840	1382840	Yes.
1382840	1383840	Yes.
1383840	1384840	Because it shouldn't matter, right?
1384840	1385840	Who I am or what I'm doing.
1385840	1386840	It should not matter.
1386840	1388560	I think in German they call it.
1388560	1389560	Yeah.
1389560	1390560	Yeah.
1390560	1391560	Yeah.
1391560	1392560	Yeah.
1392560	1393560	Yeah.
1393560	1394560	Yeah.
1394560	1395560	Yeah.
1395560	1396560	Yeah.
1396560	1397560	Yeah.
1397560	1398560	Yeah.
1398560	1399560	Yeah.
1399560	1400560	Yeah.
1400560	1401560	Yeah.
1401560	1402560	Oh yeah.
1402560	1403560	Baby, baby.
1403560	1404560	How are you doing tonight?
1404560	1405560	Mr. Typewriter.
1405560	1406560	Mr. Typewriter.
1406560	1407560	Yeah.
1407560	1408560	Get ready for a wonderful adventure.
1408560	1409560	Not in a city, not in a village, no assholes.
1409560	1410560	In a town.
1410560	1411560	When I say dad, you say home.
1411560	1412560	Dad.
1412560	1413560	Dad.
1413560	1414560	When I say man, you say town.
1414560	1415560	Man.
1415560	1416560	Man.
1416560	1417560	Dad.
1417560	1418560	Home.
1418560	1419560	Dad.
1419560	1420560	Dad.
1420560	1423560	When I say man, you say town.
1423560	1424560	Man.
1424560	1425560	Man.
1425560	1426560	Dad.
1426560	1427560	Home.
1427560	1428560	Home.
1428560	1431640	It's a lot of calling and then also saying it.
1431640	1433200	It's very simple.
1433200	1437440	Sleepy time, taking a nap, doing everything I can in my lap.
1437440	1438440	Yeah.
1438440	1439440	When I finish I go to sleep.
1439440	1440440	My quill.
1440440	1441440	Sleepy town.
1441440	1442440	Yo.
1442440	1444240	I was just trying to challenge you.
1444240	1446000	I was like doing that.
1446000	1447000	What's your hypothesis?
1447000	1451120	Well no, I was saying like like the hype man equivalent of doing sit-ups with someone
1451120	1455800	sitting on your chest would be the sleepiest rapper and then you're the hype man for like
1455800	1456800	a sad, sleepy.
1456800	1458800	I'm not doing you any favors.
1458800	1459800	Oh, I love it, though.
1459800	1462800	Like, I can imagine Flavor Flav would be like Chuck after the show.
1462800	1467800	He'd be like, yo, Chuck, you think you can meet me halfway?
1467800	1468800	This is why I love this.
1468800	1469800	I don't care.
1469800	1472800	If you go halfway, I'll get very excited to go 150%.
1472800	1474800	All right, well, I'm going to commit this.
1474800	1476800	OK, all right, here we go.
1476800	1479800	Space is fun to go to.
1479800	1481800	I'm rapping like a go-to rapper.
1481800	1482800	OK, bring some space.
1483800	1486800	Going to go to space, go to a planet.
1486800	1488800	I haven't even had it.
1488800	1489800	Can't stand it.
1489800	1491800	So good in a year.
1491800	1493800	I fucked your mama from ear to ear.
1493800	1495800	Matthew McConaughey, interstellar,
1495800	1497800	feeling so good from the floor to the cellar.
1497800	1498800	Dan!
1502800	1504800	Floor to the cellar, go in underground,
1504800	1505800	go for a wine.
1505800	1506800	Look at what I found.
1506800	1507800	Got a cork.
1508800	1509800	Oh, my God.
1513800	1514800	Dan Harmon.
1517800	1518800	Dan Harmon.
1525800	1528800	Taking a nap, going out, taking no traps.
1533800	1536800	That's what they say you need, motherfucker.
1537800	1538800	Fuck us.
1543800	1546800	Incredible hypemanship.
1546800	1547800	Yes, thank you.
1547800	1551800	Unmistakably, completely autonomous of the...
1551800	1554800	It's like you are radiating hype.
1554800	1555800	Oops.
1557800	1559800	That's not a note.
1559800	1561800	That's your five-star review.
1561800	1562800	Oh, thank you.
1562800	1564800	Yeah, because I guess what I'm learning
1564800	1569800	is that the hype man doesn't have to be just a sidekick.
1569800	1572800	The hype man can be his own soloist.
1572800	1573800	Yes.
1573800	1575800	It's like if you have spilled some gate right on the floor.
1575800	1576800	Where does it go?
1576800	1577800	It's anyplace.
1577800	1578800	Who knows?
1586800	1588800	Were you a Sugar Cubes fan?
1588800	1589800	Who?
1589800	1590800	Like before Bjork broke out?
1590800	1591800	Is it like ingesting?
1591800	1592800	No, no.
1592800	1595800	Sugar Cubes, Bjork's old band, it was Bjork,
1595800	1598800	and then there was just this guy who was kind of her hype man.
1598800	1599800	No.
1599800	1600800	Okay.
1600800	1604800	I've heard of Sugar Cubes as what you would dump in a coffee to get it hyped.
1604800	1605800	Right.
1606800	1608800	Cubes with a K or with a C, Dan?
1608800	1611800	Sugar Cubes just spelled like with a C, yeah.
1611800	1612800	Oh, okay.
1612800	1613800	It was Bjork.
1613800	1614800	You know who Bjork is.
1614800	1615800	Yes, yes, yes, Iceland.
1615800	1616800	Strange.
1616800	1617800	Flamingos.
1617800	1618800	Meat.
1619800	1623800	She, before she was solo, she was in a band called the Sugar Cubes.
1623800	1624800	Oh, this was her wham.
1624800	1625800	Yes.
1625800	1626800	Got it.
1627800	1628800	It's like talking to Mark.
1628800	1629800	You're like, Mark.
1629800	1630800	Mark.
1630800	1631800	Mark and Bjork.
1633800	1634800	Perfect.
1635800	1637800	Flula, you've got there.
1637800	1640800	My boss's family is coming for dinner tonight.
1640800	1642800	You have to learn how to behave.
1642800	1643800	Zinks, oinks.
1649800	1654800	Listen, you do a show here at the Hayworth Dynasty typewriter show.
1654800	1657800	Nice branding shout out in case people did not know.
1657800	1658800	Yeah.
1658800	1661800	If you walked here and bought your tickets, you could do it again for Flula.
1661800	1663800	But you probably already knew he was here, right?
1663800	1664800	Who didn't eat it?
1664800	1665800	What's that?
1665800	1666800	You did?
1666800	1667800	No, I'm saying to them.
1667800	1668800	Oh, yes.
1668800	1669800	Just in case they don't know.
1669800	1670800	Okay.
1670800	1671800	What's that show like?
1671800	1672800	Up and up.
1672800	1676300	I'm like a man that sits where you are sitting and I have a looping pedal and I just make
1676300	1679200	some tasty tunes and say, well, it's on occasion.
1679200	1680800	How does a looping pedal work?
1680800	1685060	I don't know if that's a dumb question, but like it's like, it's like, so like you, you
1685060	1689580	could go like biscuits, biscuits, and then you hit the pedal and the pedal makes it just
1689580	1690580	keep going.
1690580	1694100	So you forgot to hit the pedal first.
1694100	1699060	So you want to go biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits,
1699060	1701300	gravy, biscuits, gravy, biscuits.
1701300	1702300	Oh, okay.

1703300	1704300	Tasty.
1704300	1705300	Nasty, Jeff.
1705800	1706800	So deep.
1706800	1707800	Change of socks.
1707800	1709800	Baby chicken pox.
1709800	1712760	Steve Levy and the vodka solo.
1712760	1715600	Is that what summons the vodka?
1715600	1718120	We accidentally, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, gravy.
1718120	1719800	What summons the tacos?
1719800	1720800	Okay.
1720800	1725240	I thought we had a good jam going there with the biscuits.
1725240	1726960	That was nice.
1726960	1728120	You're working with Conan.
1728120	1730680	You're doing, the show is produced by him.
1730680	1731680	I'm, I'm, I'm.
1731680	1732680	You sound disgusted.
1732680	1733680	Yeah.
1734060	1735060	Discuss it with myself.
1735060	1737700	Cause I'm like, I don't, I don't know enough about you.
1737700	1738700	You're a delightful person.
1738700	1742280	And I'm like, I'm a fucking, like I, I'm a bad host and a bad person.
1742280	1743700	So that's the look on my face.
1743700	1746900	I'm very familiar as a German, we have all of these feelings.
1746900	1747900	Okay.
1747900	1748900	Yeah.
1748900	1753260	You're the German language would just stack a bunch of words.
1753260	1758580	There would be a, what is the word for the fact that you could stack a bunch of words
1758580	1759580	together and make a new word.
1759580	1760580	Isn't there a German word?
1760580	1761580	Yeah.
1761580	1762580	Yeah.
1762580	1763580	Yeah.
1763580	1764580	Yeah.
1764580	1765580	Yeah.
1765580	1766580	Yeah.
1766580	1767580	Yeah.
1767580	1768580	Yeah.
1768580	1769580	Yeah.
1769580	1770580	Yeah.
1770580	1771580	Yeah.
1771580	1772580	Yeah.
1772580	1773580	Yeah.
1773580	1774580	Yeah.
1774580	1779560	I, I, I love, uh, what's my favorite is, uh, for Corbin height for common height.
1779560	1780560	Yeah.
1780560	1781560	What does it mean?
1781560	1782560	Perfection.
1782560	1783560	Okay.
1783560	1784560	Right.
1784560	1785560	Yeah.
1785560	1786560	Yeah.
1786560	1787560	Yeah.
1787560	1788560	Yeah.
1788560	1789560	Yeah.
1789560	1790560	Yeah.
1790560	1791560	Yeah.
1791560	1792560	Yeah.
1792560	1793560	Okay.
1793560	1794560	Very slowly.
1794560	1795560	Say, say word by word.
1795560	1796560	Scheiße Freundlich.
1796560	1797800	And so you've gotten the first one to do this.
1797800	1798800	Shit friendly.
1798800	1799800	Oh, nice.
1799800	1801540	Scheiße Freundlich occurs many times.
1801540	1803640	I was recently in Atlanta.
1803640	1806780	And so if someone is like, Hey, how would you like some Turkey?
1806780	1807780	Do you like it?
1807780	1811880	You know, it's like, but you know, it's soon when they turn around, they are very miserable
1811880	1813340	with their life.
1813340	1815840	So poop friendly is not a real friendly.
1815840	1816840	It is a do-do friendly.
1816840	1817840	Oh, I was right.
1817840	1818840	My friendly?
1818840	1819840	Yeah.
1819840	1824460	So if someone has likes a face that is happy but deep inside they are just they do not like you so much
1825060	1827520	Does it have choice for English choice pointless?
1827520	1831900	Does it have to be focused on you or could it just be that they're because you said they're like miserable
1832020	1838220	Or is it about their feelings toward you? No, it's like like in physics the vector does the direction doesn't matter
1838220	1841600	It's just all over the place. It's not a ray. It's just a bit
1842860	1847460	It's the fact that they're they're they're comfortable wearing a mask. Yes
1847980	1850940	Did you know that Dan Harmon is a very well-known
1854180	1858180	Yeah, I think I pee in my pants. Yeah
1860740	1864820	Yes, my socks yeah, oh yeah, that's very good. Would you like one more? Yes
1866500	1871540	Trap and wits a tapper is a stairs or for you guys this care stays stays what you know
1871540	1874100	The stappy stappy stappy is what's this called a case of stairs?
1875100	1876460	Thank You Spencer
1876460	1878740	And if it's is a joke, okay
1878740	1884700	And so it is like if you and I are having some reportees reportees or whatever like I say something rude to me
1884940	1886940	Fuck you, and I would be like
1887700	1893020	And as I leave I think of a good response, but I am already in this case it is too late
1894700	1896700	That's the
1897420	1899420	Speed is Callier. Yep
1900380	1904300	The spirit of the spirit I guess I guess you guys are next to that we did yeah
1905300	1907820	Yeah, we said we wouldn't and then we did well they
1909580	1915180	Expect a march through it. I think that that was born on the Alsace-Lorane, which is you know, it's a disputed region between
1915420	1917420	It was Germany for six years
1918740	1921640	It's still grudges no grudge I love it over there
1923100	1925600	What do you call it in German again? I was on Trapin wits
1926160	1930920	Trapin wits here because the Treppin is the stairs. Yes, and if it is a joke is a response
1930920	1936160	I do love the idea that both in both phrases. It's like the thing that stayed was the stairs the stairs for me
1936360	1939800	it's like like and I think there's an English equivalent like
1940520	1946120	It just it just stairway wit or something. We call it like it's not a it's not a household phrase
1946120	1948880	But like it's people that borrowed it from the French
1949880	1955900	But it's like I like that I like the thing that stays is the staircase because that implies that you were
1956240	1961080	Definitely a guest and definitely on the second floor or higher in it also. Yeah
1961960	1967160	Well, that's what's interesting to me. It's like what does that why is that important? There must be some reason
1967160	1972040	Yes, is it like a Downton Abbey thing? Well, you were a premier. It's like the it's
1972560	1978560	You know, are you talking to me like that like looking in the mirror like like like I'm like
1978560	1983160	I'm a hero talking to nobody right now. It's the idea that you've got the come back
1983160	1986560	But why not why not the the Lasprita sidewalk?
1986560	1993440	why not why not why not parking lot why not hallway and the answer must be very specific like in our psyche because it's like
1993520	1999440	To be going downstairs after you I think it evokes penthouses. I think it evokes like
1999960	2005880	Modern metropolitan to live in the ground floor in France would be like lower status to live a little higher up
2005880	2013280	It would be a little like you means you're in the city and you're like it's not like wit of the of the pasture
2013280	2019680	Yeah, like like like Oh farmer Brown like made a comment about my milking. I came up with something by the scarecrow
2020720	2028120	It's not the stakes aren't that high. It's like the staircase evokes this you're on your way down and out of the building from a meeting
2028120	2033080	Yeah, or from a view or yeah or from a like a like a lover's nest
2033080	2039060	You know like like you're you're leaving something important and you on the stairway like damn it
2039080	2046120	I knew the exact word. Do you know Hanstamp Hanstamp Hanstamp? Like is that a friend of yours Hanstamp?
2048240	2054220	What does dump mean steam yeah Hanstamp you've never heard that well, that's like Thomas Tommy steam is it like an
2055100	2060540	It's a children's show. It's a train everybody. It's time for a hot stop stop. Hey kids. Yeah
2060700	2062700	Have you heard of a four-stroke engine?
2064020	2070980	No, I thought that meant like something like like in English like Joe blow like like a blow hard somebody just talks
2070980	2074500	Oh, like if you it's full of the air the hot full of
2076100	2079540	Guys being a real hot stomp up there. Listen to him. Oh, you're just
2080460	2086040	Did you know I've not heard this okay, is it something that you if I were trying to get into the
2087460	2089460	I can tweet it
2090980	2093820	I've only saying that because I was called that one. Sorry. Oh
2096180	2101060	Did you think of something later did you think that did you Japan
2101060	2103060	Teppin Steel
2105620	2107620	Treppin what fits
2109260	2115820	What is your let's get back to your biopic for those that don't know you at all biopic or biopic I say biopic
2115820	2117820	This makes sense. But sometimes people say biopic
2118700	2122860	Biopic biopic. Thank you and biopic is stupid. Yes. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Yes, I
2123620	2128180	Guess I guess biopic means they have they've only seen the word in in print
2128260	2132860	Oh like with chassis the thing in the automobile. Yeah chassis and then someone I
2133420	2136540	Never punished those people because I'm like you read something

2149340	2151340	It's like a favor you do people now
2153460	2157220	Yeah, wait wait wait wait I lost my train of thought I purposely derailed you
2158260	2162180	You asked about his biopic. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, it's just I just want to get back to your
2163860	2166540	Because this is a this is a story of
2167540	2173780	You you you're 12 your parents pack up they go we're going to we're going to Avalon

2182660	2188300	You got your your did your parents drag you to America? Why did you why what happened?
2188300	2194820	I was very fascinated always as a child with America all German people just all this is how it's part of the DNA
2194820	2199380	You think I think I think you think who knows so they are teachers and have summer breaks
2199380	2204940	So in the summer we would come here sometimes so this was my first exposure to your to the disease of a vacation
2204940	2210260	And I got it. Yeah, and so then when I was able and legal to come I attended your country
2210260	2215540	Did your parents bring you here? Just because they knew you were into it. No, everyone was into it. Okay. Yeah
2215540	2218060	Yeah, it's like they're like wraps. Like everyone kind of like us
2218860	2224980	You're like mom dad. I'm into America and they were like get out of my brain. Yeah, stop it
2224980	2227940	Yeah, just out of my dreams get into my car. Yeah
2229900	2234700	That is a solid Billy Ocean reference and also you're wearing Billy Ocean sweater right now
2235980	2237820	Billy lent it to me
2237820	2243300	What was the first when your first trip to America in that context, what was the what city did you choose?
2243300	2249460	Oh a Cornwall on the Hudson in near to New York City, which is outside of West Point. Yeah. Yeah
2249460	2251020	Why was that chosen?
2251020	2257620	It sounds I like that. That sounds like there was like a dictator that just told me here. We're dropping you here bitch. I
2258940	2266800	Have a pen pal. I had a pen pal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah international pen pal international. Yes expensive stamps. No phone calls
2267820	2274820	That's nice. Yeah. Yeah. How long did you correspond with this pen pal? It's seven years. Are you kidding me? No jokes
2276500	2281420	Starting from what age were you seven and then so you continued it till you were yes, pretty
2283820	2285820	Is letter writing
2285820	2289620	I just want to stare in a mirror and
2295100	2302100	I'm assuming no email. No, no writing writing for real. Of course actual stamps and then below. Yes. It's writing chassis and all these other words
2302100	2305980	Correctly, that is really cool. I bet that I mean like like who's this person?
2305980	2309780	I mean, you don't have to bet their privacy is their business, but like they're an American
2310340	2312900	person that's corresponded with you for seven years like
2313780	2316660	I'm sure this had a huge imp. I don't know am I being naive?
2316660	2320420	I'm like boy that that seems like such a great thing for a kid develop magic
2320420	2325420	Oh male is magic like when you receive a letter from a person that has been written by hand, you know
2325420	2332780	It's like Shawshank Redemption, but also just have a relationship for years and years was the entire seven years you'd never met in person
2332780	2337860	Yeah, correct. I mean, that's just like such a that's like like doing this a million sit-ups
2337860	2342340	It's social media wise and someone is sitting on you as you do it. Yeah, they're trying to hype that crowd
2344300	2348920	How did you first meet I'm sorry, oh so I was classes we are connected
2348940	2354460	So they're the two teachers would connect the two classes and say okay now you're going to speak to someone from the school
2354460	2356460	Wow, you've kept all the letters
2356580	2361540	Yes, I'd my parents have them now. Yes, and when's the last time you talked to this other?
2361820	2363820	Many years
2363820	2369140	Thousands of days. Do you do would you even know how to get in touch with them if you probably Google?
2369140	2375460	But like I am mysteriously in curious. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean I I would be too. I would be too
2376220	2381860	Because it could only where did that relationship kind of fizzle out and die or like why did that go away?
2381860	2388380	I think we just as you said they turned 14 and since different things, you know new kids on the block hanging tough, you know
2389380	2394580	Yeah, that that uh, that changed me to there was there was tough hanging to do yeah, so much
2394580	2399020	I didn't know that you had to hang that tough you do. Yeah. Yeah
2399020	2403060	Yeah, I was hanging much too subtly. Yeah, but now wait a minute
2403060	2406900	So you said that the reason why you guys chose Cornwall on the Hudson?
2406900	2411260	Yes, it was is because that was the location of the pen pal. Yes
2411260	2414340	So that you did you guys meet face-to-face? We just meet here
2414340	2418620	So that was it was that at the 14 you guys were 14 and we met at the Cal doors
2418620	2424380	Which is an old mall outside in Newberg. Yeah, and and and so you guys were like, it's you
2424380	2428940	It's like it's you and I said, it's me and then we liked it a rap thing a CNC music factory
2428940	2430940	Have you guys heard of everybody dance now? Yeah
2433620	2437660	Take a breath and go for yours. Oh my command now. Here's a dance floor. It's gonna make you sweat
2437660	2439660	Do you groove is that open up that one? Yeah
2440260	2442640	What do you bleed? Sorry, sorry you bleed. Thank you
2444340	2452220	So you guys so you guys met face-to-face you had an orange Julius together and
2452740	2456300	You guys never wrote to each other again after that. No, we were done. Yeah
2457180	2459180	Oh, look at you
2460420	2467420	Remember that time you wrote that thing. Yeah, I'm holding it to page 2 was it was it was it do you like?
2468820	2471700	Sorry, I'm making the whole night about this is fascinating to me
2471700	2478220	Do what do you did you guys agree in that face-to-face meeting? We're done, right?
2478340	2483540	No, it just happened because of that and you never acknowledged it, but it just happened
2483540	2486140	It is like when you are in love with a lady or man or a tree
2486140	2490540	Whatever is your thing and you speak for many many. Yeah, and then it happens and then it's like yeah
2490540	2496900	I mean, how could it? Oh, we cannot talk to us. That's really sad. Oh, it's great. It was wonderful
2496900	2501300	It was a nice reason to come to America and enjoy some things and you know have an orange Julius
2502300	2507260	We don't have any cinnabon, right? It's a whole model smells. Why is the cinnabon everywhere?
2507260	2510940	It does not matter where you are. It smells of these juicy buns. I
2511540	2517180	Just wonder I got my my cynical brain like wants to know there's two 14 year old kids
2517180	2524640	Like was it mutual was one of them completely disenchanted? Did there was there a chain reaction? Like what happened?
2525660	2530660	I know that I wrote to him one time and I think maybe he also did but we never it never nothing
2530660	2536820	Yeah, just tapered off. Yeah, it was like yeah, I hope that that person is not out there somewhere
2537380	2539940	Mike, you know, where I fucked it up. I fucked it up
2541060	2545140	He's fine. I gave him my star calm spaceship. Have you heard of star calm?
2545660	2549820	You push a button that opens very very slowly. The men have metal feet
2551180	2557740	Was that what micronauts became? I don't know micronauts are these like a small part of Russia astronauts?
2558540	2563740	Now micronauts were these like little type plastic guys with a million joints and they had plastic feet and everything
2563740	2568200	Yeah, they get inside metal feet. We know we know all this they take it inside the micromachines with
2571620	2578680	Well, whatever we'll figure this out like like this this could is it easier to be a hype man in German or in English for
2578680	2583740	You even in Germany use English words, you know, we just like to save them like all of our things are English
2583740	2590580	We have lucky strike the cigarettes all of the pre all of the advertisements are always in English. It's like son of a bitch
2592340	2594340	Like a strike
2596020	2600580	The I mean you're joking of course, but I know I think
2603300	2608220	I think my favorite advertisement of all time is an early lucky strike and I might be wrong
2608220	2614060	I think it's lucky strike and it was like in the 40s. So round so firm so fully packed
2615740	2617740	Penis
2617780	2622820	I can't tell if it's an ass or a dick. What is it? Yeah, I want to smoke it whatever it is
2622900	2624900	Whatever you want to suck on
2625740	2628980	You want to light it on fire and put it in your mouth. Yes
2630300	2636620	We don't we don't want to disenchant any demographic. It's fucking round and fully packed like get your mouth on it. So right immediately
2638860	2643020	You'd be a fool not to put it in your mouth. Well, so you cut so you so you come
2643740	2650100	With your your parents you meet your pen pal, whatever like America becomes this thing and then there's a certain point
2650100	2652100	So I just want to then understand
2653620	2657660	At what point you because you said and I like you're kind of a
2658500	2664780	Dry guy, so I'm not sure which is true and which is not but you came here entered a hype man contest
2664780	2669420	And then like but I just want to know like like yeah, what point are you an adult and you go like?
2669420	2670900	All right, that's it. I'm making the move
2670900	2675740	I'm gonna be here on a tourist visa or a work visa and then you're like and then you're okay
2675740	2678900	I'm staying and I've I've done it. It's just fascinating to me
2678900	2683580	Well the introduction like the first taste of cocaine when the man's like, please snort it for free, you know
2683580	2687740	This was my Cornwall, right? Yeah, that was my Cornwall and then some years later
2687740	2691420	I was like I need to try this this cocaine for real, you know
2691420	2693420	Well, if that's the case, then can I pause you there?
2693420	2697940	Cuz I want to know like a 14 year old German boy in whatever year we won't date you
2698020	2704940	But we know you played with GI Joes and the which but yes, I did if German moved slowly. Maybe that was 1997
2708620	2714300	Do you remember details of like comparing it to that what is it? What is that crack hit of America?
2714300	2720260	Like what are the what what hits your lungs that you're like, oh shit. Maybe I should live here
2720260	2726340	Oh as a television. Yes, you guys you had very dope MTV and then you had very many call numbers
2726340	2729860	You know one nine one two twenty ten ten two twenty with Toby Keith
2730140	2735920	Like ten one dollar gives you 20 minutes of call time. He said right Toby. He's like yes, you know
2736740	2739060	But you didn't call any of those. Yes, of course
2739980	2742980	You called Toby Keith. I call he was he did not answer
2742980	2746340	It was I also called one eight hundred USA girl
2746340	2750460	And if you call one eight hundred USA girl, you can try to be America's girl
2750460	2756020	And so I would call as me but like with a high voice and try to apply to win the USA girl competition
2756700	2762500	All right. I can't all right. I'm not gonna one eight hundred USA girl. Yeah, but it's not all right
2762500	2764500	I'm not gonna be sincere anymore. I
2764540	2767340	saw real things wait, but it was like I
2768020	2773100	Believe you a little bit when you're saying like that was a thing like the TV had all these commercials on it for these things
2773100	2777720	But the whole culture is free and everything is cool, but it wasn't free. It was a dollar 95 a minute
2777720	2781500	It was a horribly. I hate it. No, you just it's like so I ought to baby eats a boy
2781500	2783620	Do you remember this commercial? Right? Yeah
2785700	2789560	Yeah, so you so so that I get so you're it's just
2789860	2796780	Coming over here from Europe like the TV and that culture was actually like overwhelmingly a positive thing
2796780	2799460	Yes, and rule bending and breaking is so fun here to do
2799460	2802700	You know like when after before I won the hype band contest
2802700	2808840	I was here before one time and I watched five films at the Burbank AMC 16, but only paid for one. I
2810260	2813780	Watched a Cinderella man and and many or mrs.
2813780	2819140	Mr. And mrs. Smith and in the war of the words and then it's a very as you can just stay in the theater
2819140	2822700	Okay in Germany this will not happen. Yeah, right because the
2823540	2824700	The
2824700	2832100	Underbelly of extreme capitalism is like who's gonna watch five movies. Let's not and why would tell you an usher to oh, yeah
2832100	2836140	Sorry, I thought you were referencing Churchill's Italian Italy strategy of World War two. Oh, no, no
2836140	2838860	Sorry, that that's what I thought to soft underbelly
2839860	2841860	Sorry, I
2842540	2844540	Didn't know a soft underbelly's were
2845180	2850100	They came up to the random Palermo and they went to Sicily. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
2851100	2855860	Look, it was I think we can all agree. It was a very tragic war for everybody. Well, uh
2857100	2859420	It's all for it. Let's be real. We are the real dicks
2860260	2864620	We know now I have a couple friends that are German and they didn't people
2865540	2869540	Americans that I know like the kind of the joke is that Germans have a weird sense of humor
2869540	2872100	But I find that the Germans such a humor is incredibly funny
2872100	2878000	And I think a lot of it is the wordplay let because we are as English speakers
2878480	2884800	It's a Germanic language like pretty like largely. There's also like Latin it roots and stuff like that
2884800	2889220	But we're very German, but my German friends that if they hear a word
2889220	2895960	They have eight jokes for it like like which you've already kind of proven like it's it's I find the German sense of humor
2895960	2899040	Really really delightful. Wow, that's very rare to hear and
2900920	2906320	I have it my friend from England. He was like, hey, do you know the difference between British humor and German humor?
2906320	2909240	I said don't tell me he's like a British humor is funny. Suck it
2912000	2919380	Well, but British humor is like, you know, also wordplay and irony and but but the German humor in my experiences
2920640	2922640	It's really like
2922640	2925800	Punny, but in a fun way puns can be kind of awful
2926040	2932960	but the the the use of words to turn themselves in inside out is I find very good I
2933320	2937240	Like this as well. I feel like it is an affliction. I don't know that it's funny
2938160	2942880	Yeah, but yeah, you can't help yourself from it. I cannot help it. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I love it
2942880	2947240	Yes, so you come over here. You enter a hype man content. I do. Yes, this is a real thing
2947880	2953520	Yes, the sigh up. I would send you the link. It's a sigh on hype man contest in Chicago, Illinois
2953520	2959760	Yeah, and they're like and I love the spirit of this contest. They're like we want we're looking for somebody who's pure hype man
2959760	2961760	yes, and then I
2962120	2967440	I can see why like you're yeah, like you you take the cake and
2967840	2973000	So I wonder about what did your parents do by the way? Oh, no taking the cake is good
2976600	2983120	Thank you, I did not know if it takes a cake was a euphemism for invading Poland or something like that you can just
2985680	2990160	You're not Borat you know, you know that taking the cake is good. Yes
2990760	2993060	Cake is nice. I like cake. Let's take it
2997920	3003560	But there was a point where you I'm just curious like what did your what did your family do?
3003560	3008080	Like what there was a point where it seems like because it goes fast forward to the end of it
3008080	3013160	You're you're you're you're a guest on the show. You're working with Conan. You're all over the place
3013160	3019280	Your face is on postage stamps. You're you're you're you're a successful luminary. You're an icon
3019360	3021360	You're a you're a celebrated person
3022200	3023600	and
3023600	3025440	in like I
3025440	3032200	I'm fascinated by this this fact that there had to be a moment where there was like this boat that like you you're like
3032200	3037120	I'm gonna just do this for real. Like I'm not gonna just have a fantasy about
3037760	3044120	Being like crazy and fun and like I I'm actually like I'm gonna suck on this nipple and it
3049520	3051800	Well in Germany those on nipples, I don't say
3053520	3055800	Welcome to America. It's a Boise nipple
3056480	3058680	We call it. Yeah, we're very homophobic culture here
3058680	3062800	So we we call when we have to grip something and just put the whole thing in our mouth
3062800	3067480	They just call it a giant cylindrical nipple. Got it. Okay, it keeps us straight. Yeah
3069320	3071720	You just want to chug on that fame
3072920	3075840	And then you tickle the undergrains out everybody
3076560	3077880	Um
3077880	3080360	But I don't know I just penis right
3080360	3083760	It's I swear this is the last this is the last biopic question
3083760	3086640	I ask of these then we can get into the present and have fun or whatever
3086640	3090040	but like I just I just want to be at that moment of of
3090520	3098000	Actual like because you're are you American now? Are you a dual citizen? Do you have no not American but
3098640	3105040	Maybe this will occur. I don't it doesn't matter so much not anymore. Yeah. Well now it's weird. Yeah
3105080	3109640	Yeah, I mean the last president was born in Kenya and the current one can't read. Oh
3110720	3112720	Yes, both facts
3117040	3119040	Anyway, but but but
3119080	3124200	Okay, but I will answer. Okay, so this is I know you I'm telling you truths for yeah
3124200	3128640	It's I entered this hype on hype man contest for real. I did not know I would win
3128640	3132560	I thought I would be like the William hung right of the of the hype man contest
3132560	3137440	I just wanted like one minute of oh look at the idiot and I can show this to my parents
3137440	3140680	Right. So because I did not know what I was doing. I want this
3140680	3144480	It's always nice to be confusing if if part of hype probably yes
3144480	3149040	Like why like they would play a different beats. They're like what beat would you like to hype to I was like
3149040	3154720	I don't know beat to and then they beat too. I don't know but then they're like then they're like we're going to play beat
3156720	3159820	This other hype man would be like short-circuited, you know
3160260	3162260	Like that shitty Johnny five robot
3163420	3167180	Did you have an MC that you would hype but there was there like a dedicated MC?
3167180	3168100	There were three judges
3168100	3174060	one of the guys was ant Marshall from the lyricist lounge and then DJ Clark Kent who worked with JC and then
3174500	3182820	Shies a certain anyway, it's so say you're hyping somebody that's actually doing like rap. There's it. No, there's no what the rapper never appears
3184420	3186420	That's the ultimate
3186820	3188820	Like I don't think you're ready
3194180	3196180	You're hyping nobody
3196220	3198380	I still can't hear you
3199260	3205420	Are you ready for Dr. Xavier? Why aren't your hands already together? Yes
3206220	3211020	That's fucking why when I say hip you say nothing. No one is there. Yes. Oh
3212500	3214500	so and
3214860	3220660	Is it like a two-minute two minutes or do you do they tell you when you're done just keep going and going like we would still
3220660	3226860	Be doing your sleepy song now if you guys had continued it because I know they eventually put a hook around you or
3228180	3235300	Showtime they go like it's over. You're done. Your entry is what what how does it end when you're hyped manning in your as your
3235300	3238100	Entry in the contest as the first time the sound broke
3238100	3241500	So then I kept freestyle rapping and they were very confused that this continued
3241580	3245540	I didn't know I should stop and so they enjoyed this anyway
3245540	3250020	So I want this thing and then I was like, oh, this is a this should mean I should stay here and do more things
3250020	3255580	And so then I just it is like in the Vegas or Reno wherever you go with circus circus is located
3255580	3260660	Yeah, you just you keep making a double down of things. Yeah, that's what I just keep doing and you made a good call

3355860	3359180	Could you teach them how to be a hype man like a great
3359820	3362100	Thing is I could use some enthusiasm. Oh
3362220	3369180	So what and you could benefit from like what? Yeah, what me hype man you know what happened me? Yeah. Oh
3369820	3373420	Okay, so you will hype me foot so it's yeah he hypes you yeah
3374580	3377700	You see he's your Chuck D to his flavor
3378380	3384460	And let's see what happens. Okay, so some tips always ask a yes or no question, but it must be like a yes
3388140	3390860	So does anybody want cupcakes
3391940	3394740	Excellent. Yes, who wants to drink diarrhea?
3395740	3397500	No
3397500	3401000	Question don't do that. See cupcakes. Yes
3402020	3409460	Diary. No, no, same as telemarketing rules. He's a very you want to create a yes culture. Yes or no? Yes
3409980	3417020	Yes. Yes. It's a because if it's all yeses, then we're all ready to get hyped and but then what is the goal of the hype man?
3417020	3419020	or hype person
3419220	3424300	Is it to get the party started and yes and put the MC on like a
3425740	3429300	Floating cloud of energy like goth Brooks coming from the grand piano
3429300	3435820	Yeah, and then all they have to do is just sing a song and do nothing but maybe the crowd is already there
3435820	3439020	Yes, and in the hype man's mind. Yeah
3439460	3442800	Is there such a thing as a bad MC?
3443140	3447160	Like like like there can't be right because you have to stay the hype man
3447160	3452400	Yes, you have to stay in those brains. You can't go outside. What if you don't believe in your hype your MC?
3452400	3455040	What what if your and you become a woman that you don't believe in you're like
3455040	3460320	Do I still have to hype this person every MC is your crystal light you believe in it you believe in it?
3460640	3466920	You believe in crystal light because you believe in me. Why do you know more references in America than?
3467920	3471240	All of these people television commercials. I told you
3471760	3477480	There's the light there be such a thing as a hype man whistle-blower. Are they protected if they're like, you know
3477480	3482200	What you are terrible are ready for him and he's not ready for you
3482760	3486220	And that's a crime shit. I need to be protected
3486240	3489240	And I need people to not know my name is flavor flame
3489440	3493560	This is why I was not a successful hype man in Germany because this would exist immediately
3493560	3498360	Right would tell you right away. You are not adequate the decibels are too low away. Yeah. Yeah
3499160	3505000	So let's say you're backstage you've let's just say you've just met your MC. Okay, you're the hype man
3505000	3507640	Okay, let's say you've been lifelong friends. We're friends and
3508160	3514680	You're like, I don't think you got it tonight. I say this. No, no like in your mind. You're like, I don't think the MC
3515840	3521400	Like, how do I he's had too much a drink? He's uh, he's unhypeable. Yeah, he's unhypeable
3522040	3526800	Probably a dirty word. You it's fine. Are you a dishonest hype person?
3527200	3532520	For going out there and hyping up something that you don't believe in. Do you know who Kurt Rambis is?
3533680	3540340	Yes, the sixth man in the LA Lakers. Thank you. Okay, so wait, that's not true. That's not true. Is it true? Yes
3541320	3546040	Kurt Rambis Kurt Rambis wear glasses. He would come in and give five fouls and go out and get kicked out
3546040	3549040	Yes, and he would just punch any he would punch
3551080	3555020	I have a German hype man and a guy that sleeps in his suit
3555980	3562260	And he said do you know who Kurt Schmickenschmack is and you're like the sixth linebacker on the lake?
3562260	3566540	No, he was the six men up. He was the first one off the bench and his job was to foul
3566540	3569940	Everybody in clothesline and he salted Kevin. Kevin Bacon. Oh
3573300	3576820	Kevin Bacon also six rules six degrees who gives a shit. He said
3577740	3584380	You know go on why Kurt Rambis? Why do you say yeah your point being sometimes Kareem Abdul Jabbar and James Worthy are just tired
3584380	3587940	Oh, I don't want to play today. I don't want to make a nice sky hooky great
3587940	3590940	Bring in Kurt Kurt will foul in elbow and make a dunk
3592500	3597780	Sometimes Kareem is ready for some sky hookies and Michael Koopas making swishies and D's that is cutting
3598180	3601000	Sit on the bench make a little swiggy, sweet clap clap clap
3602020	3609420	That is a fucking beautiful idea that it goes do you can you name the starting five of the 85 Lakers?
3609420	3611420	You named most of already
3614460	3618320	I just want to find out how much more of an American he is in the we are
3619180	3621480	Byron Scott Michael Cooper James worthy
3622060	3626460	Kareem Abdul Jabbar magic Johnson and then Kurt Rambis on the bench. What the fuck?
3629540	3632460	Thank you, is this just Lakers or are you
3634100	3639540	That is the Showtime Lakers. Yeah. Yeah, I preferred but I know it's offensive. I preferred the Celtics of this era
3639540	3643220	Okay, now name of starting five Celtics Bill Walton on the bench
3644380	3650420	Dennis Johnson Larry Bird Robert Parrish Kevin McHale Danny Ainge fucking how what the hell I
3651260	3654900	Don't understand. I don't understand anyone liking sports
3654900	3657620	I don't understand an immigrant
3657620	3663500	But if you were ever going to like sports that would have been the only time to like basketball pop culture it for us
3663500	3670020	It's sports basketball is like the dopest of all the sports because of the culture. Why would Germans be watching?
3670500	3672500	American sports, it's cool
3673500	3680220	It's just cool. Nice dunking cool switching the 1992 Olympics nice. Nice. Dunkin cool switching
3681660	3686420	That better be the fucking name of this episode nice. Dunkin cool switching
3688180	3690180	Yeah as comptroller
3690500	3693580	I'm going to decree that that is the title of this episode
3693900	3701300	But it's crazy to recall the lineup of these these aren't current teams, right? These are 84 85 middle 80s
3701540	3704620	Well, it's a 1992 dream team like changed my brain
3704620	3708700	So like this is when this magic and Larry were old, but they were still on the team
3710700	3712940	They were gonna basketball the Olympics
3713700	3719060	Angola like what do you know about Angola? I don't know anything about Angola, but they're in trouble Charles Barkley. I
3722180	3725460	Can't remember this in 1982
3725980	3727980	Paradise right now. This is great
3728580	3730580	The fact that this guy knows
3731300	3734580	The starting six or five and then the bench
3734620	3739220	Could you name anybody else off the bench of the Lakers or the Celtics back then in addition to those guys?
3739820	3746300	No, yeah, but it's still the fact you got those as outrageous. I love it. Oh, it's yeah. Okay. It's just it's well
3746300	3752060	I mean, it's it's crazy to me because it speaks of a strange pocket of like a man because I don't understand
3752340	3757820	Like the things that I committed to my memory at that age were so different and I don't yeah
3757820	3761540	I'm just fascinated by like well you have different pockets than my pockets, right?
3761540	3766740	There's a pocket if you said I would be almost disgusted. I would take a shower from one of your knowledge pockets
3766740	3768740	Thank you, but but no
3772420	3775700	Dan named the name the drop of loads guy from porn
3777300	3779300	This is one of Dan's pockets
3781220	3787500	Yeah, well I can't even remember okay, no, I mean what's his name? I don't know dropping Nick Manning, thank you
3788060	3790060	Nick Manning if you're out there, are you all right?
3791540	3794380	He's dropping loads and loads of a
3794900	3801540	Note, so there's this porn star who when he's coming he says dropping loads. He says the words dropping low
3801540	3805980	Yeah, you can pronounce the G. I think yes hard G
3808380	3811460	Dropping dropping loads. Yeah. Oh
3811460	3815540	No, it's not dropping loads. Oh, you want a hard G
3815540	3817180	And then there's some for instance
3817180	3821380	There's a porn where he plays Batman and he does say dropping bat loads
3821380	3828100	Oh adds it like no he hooked into it and he's been on Howard Stern a million times of things
3828100	3835100	But he's kind of vanished. Oh, yeah, he's out there somewhere dropping loads. Okay, we get home anyway, but that's not important
3835100	3837100	He's picking up loads
3838060	3843680	Drop all of the dropped ones. I could yeah, but is it better if he says dropping with an apostrophe or dropping?
3843700	3848100	Well, what's the lesson? I don't I don't think that matters drop and loads. I
3849580	3853860	Think that's cuter. I agree. I think it's threatening. Yeah, I'm just drop
3855660	3860060	Loads off. Yeah. Yes my wife. He is my color. Is that right if I drop these loads?
3861620	3863620	I've got so much to do
3864500	3872660	That's hot. Yeah, that's the that's his that's his soft core porn work. Yes, like massage videos. Should I drop a load? No, okay
3872660	3874260	I I
3874260	3879580	Was it a porn that was about a broken washing machine you were in a point?
3879580	3884020	Yeah, and it was called unbalanced load. Oh, come on. All right, we've had enough of that
3886820	3889860	Let me let's let's try this exercise where I'm your hype man
3889860	3892900	I cuz I really think that there should be therapeutic for me and I
3893260	3898580	Find that profoundly inspiring what you said even though and I and it actually is making me rethink
3899140	3904220	Sports as a utility because you were able to draw from your relationship with sports
3904780	3908020	where you're like, oh, yeah, this guy goes out there and he
3908740	3914220	For that person to know it's not his job to be a star. Yes, how I'm interpreting it
3914220	3918660	Oh, there's a heroism there that you can tap into where you're like, I am the hype man
3918740	3922780	Okay, and no matter what this bag of dicks that I'm hyping
3922780	3929620	It's not it's not a two-way thing. Like I'm not here to receive energy from my subject. I am here to hype
3929900	3932500	Yes, I'm like a jack it lifts a car
3932500	3938060	It doesn't ask the car if the car is liftable and if the car says no, I'm feeling heavier than usual
3938060	3944700	The jack doesn't go fuck this I quit. No, it's fucking like it's defined by its jacking
3944700	3952820	Yeah, it's just jacking off and go in and then say hi. Hi. Hi pipe. Alright, so like I don't have to know anything about you
3952820	3954820	No, it doesn't matter
3954980	3958700	But so we give we do a beat, you know, okay, so some quite some tips
3958700	3964420	Okay, so as we were saying before only question. Yes, always yes questions and you add will not like that. So you ask
3965220	3968380	Ask ask the questions and so they will say yes
3968380	3973880	No matter what and then always something with two parts so they know the second part, you know, so like
3974240	3980680	Hop when I say here. Oh, okay. Okay, but don't be confusing if you like when I say pants you say people don't know
3980680	3982360	Right, right, right, right
3982360	3984940	Dance, we don't know what's happening
3985040	3991920	Right unless you want to make a little curvy ball a little Nolan Ryan action. They're very confused about what is happening a famous athlete
3991920	3993920	I'm sure yeah, just who knows nobody. Yes
3994920	3999400	Okay. All right. That's another tip. So yeah only yes questions and no
4000000	4005720	Confusing call and response like no no mad libs where they have to like puzzle it out. Yeah. Yeah, this is no sudoku
4005720	4008600	I have two and a one three three space space down to know
4009920	4013540	If their hands are in the air should they care or not care? Yeah
4014800	4019200	You can even just say wave your hands in the air and then you can just watch them if you like
4019200	4022840	All right, is there is there a way just between us? Yeah, no one's listening
4022840	4028360	Is there a way to wave your hands in the air as if you do care? Yes, I think that's the way to do it
4028400	4033440	Yeah, well obviously it's I think wave your hands in the air like it fucking mad like it
4034640	4040440	Obviously that's been tried and like it didn't work. Yeah, it I've tried wave your hands like it's important for you. Yeah
4042240	4046200	Wave your hands in the air like this is the last time you'll have hands. Yeah
4048280	4050280	Obviously that hasn't worked
4051280	4057880	It elicits screams like terror. It's like after watching human centipede these kind of screams is what okay
4057880	4063040	Is there anything else or should we should we try? I would say last thing is a ask them to scream at the end
4063040	4065040	I don't know the screen. Yes
4065760	4074280	Only ask somebody to and then don't ask everybody to somebody just ask somebody and then say anybody anybody and then elevate it to
4075040	4077040	Everybody scream. Oh
4077040	4084360	Okay, but not like somebody seemed like it's a tree. Oh to scream. Yeah, and then start permitting more screaming
4084360	4089160	I want I just want one person to scream. Okay, then that's your choice
4090680	4093140	Then you're a great phase one hype man
4094960	4101840	Like enjoy a throttle hype if all I do in my life is make one person scream that it was worthwhile then great
4102160	4105920	Enjoy, I'll have you say Joker. That's I think was his goal. I haven't seen it
4106640	4110800	Don't spoil it for me. I won't okay. I think I think Dan you you have the
4111440	4119600	The the the rules now. Yes. Well, I want you to challenge me don't take pity on me and bail me out by
4120880	4125400	Coming in and and also being hype worthy. Don't hype man you
4126160	4127520	Sure, don't bail me out
4127520	4133640	Like I want to find also whatever you do MC wise make sure that only comes from the hype that has been driven by
4134960	4139160	There should be a thing like all this has been about like the the hype me an introduction
4139160	4142280	And then they and then the and then the star kind of begins
4142280	4144280	I will tell you so the store doesn't matter
4144320	4152200	But what's your role as a hype man? What when that when that when that person is now performing hydration, what's my job hydration?

4586320	4588320	People who say it's because you're a sociopath. I
4590560	4594600	Look up sociopath and then I kick them in the testicles
4596720	4601960	Spencer you got any questions for a crazy new friend who we met all too late now that we're ending the show it could
4601960	4607100	I had him back a million times. Oh, yeah, so many questions. So what's your favorite sport?
4607760	4609000	Pacifal. Yeah
4609000	4613100	Yeah, was that real? I heard a little tone with the word sports. Oh, no
4613680	4620680	People spot people infer a lot of from my tone, but it's entirely accidental. So I'm sorry
4621320	4623320	I
4623320	4627960	That's fine, that's fine. I like basketball. It's very nice
4627960	4631400	as I said, it was a nice dunking cool swishing and and it's become a
4632240	4634840	dunking and cool swishing it's become a very
4635880	4641880	Over the last you know decade or so. It's been a very European sport now and now that the u.s. Are sucking
4642320	4647480	Yeah, is that true? What changed was it because of those Olympics with the dream team? Yes. Yes
4647600	4653240	The Olympics everyone's like only smokes we can do this dip Novitski top 10 basketball player of all time. They're a German would would
4654680	4662680	Yeah, of course and so now all of this is like a very large percentage of foreign players Spanish and German Argentina ever Africa
4662680	4664680	Oh, yes, I have to say basketball
4665120	4670720	Just about takes the cake as far as the intimidating sports like I could never intimidating
4670720	4675640	Yeah, because I can understand baseball and I could understand like okay, I'm worse at hitting the ball
4675640	4679560	I'm worse at catching the ball. But if I get good at those things, I can at least understand what's happening
4679560	4683320	Yes, but in basketball I they would pass me the ball
4683320	4688200	And then I would start to do something on the whistle would blow and everyone would be like, are you fucking kidding me?
4688200	4693440	And I'd be like what I don't understand like fundamentals then you got another ball has to bounce
4693440	4695760	But it has to bounce a certain amount
4695760	4701220	I just I never got it baseball is nice because you can have one skill and then you can survive
4701500	4708500	You know, there's like a very old very large boys that can toss a ball accurately, but there's nothing they cannot run
4708500	4712160	They cannot hit a stick with a head of a ball and is there any culture for?
4712700	4717900	American baseball I say that like there's it's like soccer like there's an there's a European baseball
4717900	4721700	Is that but it baseball is that is there any hope for that in Europe?
4721700	4726980	No, it people just look at that like we look at cricket and they go like I don't understand. Why are you doing that?
4726980	4731200	There's no history you guys have I've watched Ken Burns baseball documentary, you know
4731200	4735920	It's like part of your history like Lincoln and things. We don't have this, you know
4735920	4741680	Yes, there's no like good. It was like, you know trying to steal third, you know now he's writing poems
4741680	4747960	How how insular to England is cricket is cricket viewed the same way by the rest of Europe?
4747960	4750080	Yes, I think it's England and then the colonies
4752920	4756620	But it's like an English thing so they're like if you say so so yeah
4757620	4760980	We invent these things we invent this set of rules and then we go
4760980	4765020	This is this is it's different from movie writing or TV showwriting where you go like
4765300	4771580	This is a template for stories that are gonna be improvised by people through their athletic prowess and you're you're actually creating
4771580	4778080	You're kind of building the equivalent of multi-cam sets for a sitcom and saying wings is gonna be a hit
4778620	4783180	Like like this is this is these are the rules like these people work for an airline
4783180	4789100	and then they here's the commissary and they'll have will they won't days over here and then they're like and you and
4789460	4795260	Things take off or they don't but like some people go like I don't understand football. I don't understand soccer
4795260	4799140	I don't understand like cultures just either take it or they don't yeah
4799140	4801860	I don't know how much of that is visceral and how much of that is just
4802420	4806060	Hegemonical if that's a word how much of it is just like fucking forced on your throat
4806060	4811420	You will like soccer because that's what poor people can play in the street and that's what all of these calling it
4811420	4812820	You know
4812820	4819180	Colonial powers like like like brought so the world loves soccer. I'm sorry football football. Yeah
4820780	4822780	Thank you like
4823660	4828680	Like that's like the big one that's like the water of sports like because you can play it anywhere
4828940	4833780	Everyone gets it. Yeah, truly based on like just the prowess of people running back and forth
4835060	4837060	What are they what's my question?
4837660	4844740	That's a good it was a yes or no question. Yeah, why I don't know it's just like it's weird
4844740	4849700	Why did we invent baseball you saw the Ken Burns documentary? Why did we I have a friend if I can interrupt for a second
4849700	4854580	I go ahead a friend of mine who is from is a cricket fan a rugby rugby fan
4854580	4861340	He's from England. He's from like southern eastern. No, so southwestern England south northern west east
4861580	4862940	Like
4862940	4866420	What the fuck? Oh, he's from why I'm a Regis, but I think it's south-south west
4867380	4872620	He watched the Ken Burns documentary never knew anything about baseball and he watched it and he goes
4872620	4874260	I'm a baseball fan now
4874260	4879540	he goes like like that because I didn't realize the history behind the sport and if you
4879980	4884500	Sit and watch a cricket match with somebody who really loves cricket and they explain it to you
4884500	4890820	You become like kind of like you can become a fan of it just based on the weird minutia of it all
4890820	4898020	Yes, I I don't I don't I don't like the NFL. I stopped like in the NBA that major league baseball
4898020	4903460	I don't like the way these clubs are ran and the owners are all a bunch of rich white assholes, but
4904700	4908700	when you said Kurt Rambas that made me happy because when I was a kid that was the greatest
4909100	4914960	basketball of all time was the LA Lakers and the Boston Celtics and there was a time when
4915960	4922680	Two rivals would walk up and shake hands before the match. Yeah, and and then they murdered each other
4922680	4926120	They hated each other. Yes, but before the match there was respect and stuff like that
4926120	4929060	So there I love the fact that you somebody who's not from here
4929400	4932480	Like remembers like the teams from that like that's cool
4932480	4933920	I'm not a big sporty guy
4933920	4938560	But I do like when people play with honor and respect and you know dignity and stuff
4938560	4943040	Well, they were not making many dollars, you know those even the baseball guys were like born storm
4943040	4946560	They would play for the real team and that they would ride trains and play like tiny games
4946560	4949480	They're like strippers, you know, they just go here and do some stripping
4950480	4956760	Off-season Tampa, which guys are referring to like which Larry birds and real like early baseball guys
4956760	4959840	Are we early baseball but also basketball these dudes are huge dudes
4959840	4965000	They're playing flat flying like Pan American flights, you know to go play the 76 or some things
4965000	4971520	I heard I'm big into true crime podcast. Oh my throat is I've never hyped like that. Yeah
4971840	4977160	By the way, then for real what was amazing? You're hiding anything was fucking stupendous. I
4980440	4986280	Lost my voice just listening to you do that that was fucking there's a true crime story about a guy whose story is all about
4986280	4991200	What a great basketball player he was and how good he could have been and that his life like kind of took these weird turns
4991200	4993200	And he ends up disappearing without a trace
4993560	4997280	But what are the chapters of his life was that it Lonzo ball?
4997880	5004520	That's wait, is that I know no, no, no. Oh, it's a shot fired. Sorry. Oh, oh, that's like a basketball guy
5005080	5009300	The joke could be that he's bad. Yeah, yeah, because I thought I was like wait, maybe that's the guy's name
5010880	5013200	But part of the guy's life was that
5014200	5018300	He was invited. He kept failing out of it. He's like he got into this college and then
5018800	5025260	but he couldn't he couldn't hack it and really he his addiction like it's like because his path of
5026060	5031900	Successes and failures was a roller coaster ride and then at one point he was tapped to play in the Harlem Globetrotters
5031900	5037660	Which is like it's like to imagine the the Globetrotters are out there still being like the blue man group
5038100	5043380	like like I'm so curious about what it takes to be a Globetrotter and
5043820	5048780	What their shows are like there's are there you think they're still Harlem Globetrotters. Oh, yeah
5049140	5056300	They're amazing then and so you do you buy tickets like do they hold they must held them at the same arenas as
5056940	5061500	Regular sporting events obviously. Yes, usually not the very large arenas, but slightly smaller
5061500	5065580	But yes, it's also like they're not the pro pros but the people that are like when I was a kid
5065580	5069220	we go to the the LA forum and see them play and
5069500	5075860	It was like the circus meets sports and it was like they were clowns and and but also they were
5076460	5079340	ridiculously skilled because like metal arc lemon and
5080060	5085620	Fuck curly like those guys the shit that they could do was like a magic trick
5085620	5089380	So they would just come out you it was like it was like that was like pro wrestling
5089380	5092580	But it was like and they played the Washington Generals who always lost other
5092580	5095560	I think not always the generals like one like a couple a few a few
5096660	5100020	But they would also like come out with a bucket of water and then throw it but it was confetti
5100020	5102020	Yeah, you know
5102540	5104540	I watched they came to Germany
5104540	5109900	the and like was it was it the original guys or was it like
5110380	5114580	It couldn't have been the it was not like so there was like the Antoine mixtape tour
5114580	5116880	this is very boring, but there was a time in the
5117180	5120900	2000s were like the professor and ale and all of these guys were like
5121140	5127580	Became you knew each of those guys the globe trotters to me were never my era of that was not like this is a famous man
5127580	5129440	Who was good at the thing you think now?
5129440	5134960	They're just I don't know if they're just guys that you know had a knee injury and can't really play in the NBA anymore
5135000	5139480	But what they have is like incredible like juggling skills and clown skills
5140080	5145480	Have you seen this YouTube dude perfect? It's like five dudes that do like crazy tricks
5146040	5149720	No, okay. Well anyway, call him the globe trotters are like this before this
5150560	5154480	In the YouTube video did you I was just gonna for context the dude perfect
5154720	5159120	Like I threw a ball and it landed like on someone's nose who's across the stage
5160560	5162760	I was just gonna say there's a like a
5163840	5166680	Korean woman or something. There's some video of like
5167440	5173560	There's some there's some woman who does that like like she is a she does. I don't see gender. It could be a woman
5173560	5176120	Yeah, Dan doesn't see gender either or race
5176120	5180840	Well, that's why she could be Japanese and I might be racist, but it's a because because I don't see anything
5181720	5187120	It like but there's it's a whole YouTube video of like her just doing that shit
5187120	5192200	It's like it's like the it's like the globe Trotter version of parkour like it's it's her like
5192440	5197520	walking by a laundromat and then someone's like you forgot your jacket and then she throws a
5197680	5202360	Can of Pepsi and the Pepsi like hits a skateboarder and the jacket like hangs on a hook
5202360	5207320	I do a bad job of improvising that yeah, it's all that. That's like what dude perfect does
5207400	5213120	Yeah, she's like walking up a staircase and throws a thing over her shoulder and it like it like makes a guy that was about to
5213120	5215120	Eat poison not eat poison
5217960	5224160	It's like a pawn but two tricks I wonder if she I would it's like like cuz it's like she'll do a thing like
5224160	5226680	she'll chill she sidekicks a
5227720	5229480	soda
5229480	5232640	Cap off of the bottle. Oh the bottle cap challenge
5233000	5240200	I wonder who's ripping off who or if they both are like students of some gene Autry that
5241040	5247080	That did it kind of shitty like hey, and he kind of like went like this and three times out of ten throw me an ice cube
5247600	5250360	So I'm gonna ask you. Is it gonna be dude perfect?
5250880	5253600	People fell upon bloom bloom. Oh god
5256320	5258720	Did that go in the in the piano
5259360	5261360	Let's say yes, let's say yes
5261440	5266440	That would have been a dude. Perfect. Wait, did you really want an ice cube or did you want me to do perfect by the leg?
5266960	5269920	As long as it's not inside the piano
5273840	5278920	What did you why did you not know you want it you you would you want to throw the dirty okay win well
5278920	5280920	He's doodling perfect
5283600	5286880	Close my eyes. Why is that important?
5287840	5293440	It's like William Tell there's only one reason you want me to do that just thank you in the nose
5298080	5303880	Is this to every harm in town more or less yeah, just 20 minutes of no they say we are in
5307920	5312640	No one's got it in the front row it's behind the speaker it's just gonna match right see ya
5313560	5318920	That could be good any other sports
5321080	5323600	Now imagine if your eyes were closed during that
5325120	5331400	Think about how amazing that would be what if it went in what if it went in what if it hit me on the head, bro
5332200	5340080	That would have been yeah. Yeah, you guys watching succession. No, I started everyone's loving it. The finale just happened
5340080	5345640	Did you see the finale? I think I might be one episode behind. I may not have seen the finale me neither
5345640	5352480	Yeah, it grew on me a lot real fast. I've just started. I'm behind. Yeah, it grows on you. It grows on you quick
5352480	5354480	Do you have a favorite person? I?
5355800	5361440	Yes, Oh who might it? I like I like I like Kendall now. I knew it
5362640	5364640	Cuz I like his journey
5364640	5366160	Yeah, I
5366160	5368600	Like that. He's become a husk and that the husk
5369280	5375960	Actually reveals like a core there because the core was never allowed. Yeah a million reasons father-son stuff
5376600	5383840	like I like Kendall was somebody that I I was like I I was like fuck this junkie
5384120	5389640	You know and then like through that conduit. I like it was like oh shit like
5390480	5395600	I think that's the magic of that show is it's like sucking people in or that's the magic of television
5395600	5397600	You just watch one thing
5400720	5403040	Anyways, but what else
5404920	5406920	Look here's the thing yeah
5410640	5414220	Wait, I had a I had a I had an idea to sing
5414440	5420620	Yeah, I had an idea a second ago. Is it really my job to make sure the show is like a show not Jeff's job
5420700	5427060	Shall I ask a side question while you ponder? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Hey is one of the guys a brother of Macaulay Culkin on the show?
5427060	5430300	Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, and he's quite good
5430300	5435460	And I would I would I would I would recommend to people that they not know that when they start watching the show
5435460	5441180	I agree and that they're reminded of it after they've watched a couple episodes because that will make you go. Holy shit
5441180	5444520	Wow, what a what a what an impact? Yes
5445260	5447260	Did that give you enough time? I
5447620	5452140	Got I got enough time. Yeah, cuz cuz Cody eventually said to me, you know who that is
5452140	5457500	I'm like, I don't care who it is. I'm just enjoying him and she's like, that's that's a Culkin
5457500	5459660	I'm like, all right. I'm glad I didn't know that I
5460620	5462620	Meant did I buy you enough?
5464020	5467900	No, no, no you did not cuz I can only do one thing at once. Yeah, I'll cut it quick
5468700	5473860	I watched in the plane then I'll solve for you. I watched in the plane ride home from Minneapolis this morning
5474340	5476700	The one of the two fire fest
5477460	5481660	Documentary is on the Delta flights. You saw that one. Yeah. Yeah, that is a
5482540	5488460	It's pretty fucked up the tribal warfare between the two fire documentaries. It's really funny to me
5489020	5493980	We have friends who worked on one or the other and I'm always losing track
5493980	5497100	I think I've seen them both and I think I'm pretty much like yeah
5497100	5501380	I don't like we're not in the tank for either fire documentary. It seems like fire
5501860	5507340	I don't think you need to see two of those. I just wanted to find out like oh, it was a bunch of douchebags
5507340	5512900	So I think that's all you need to know out of that, right? It's a that's a yeah, that's a fucked up glimpse at everything. I
5513940	5520140	Did have a weird experience where I was like because there's there's one of them where there's one of the guys who like does the
5520140	5527180	Whole monologue about how he he was he was allegedly willing to blow a guy for water and that that okay
5527180	5529180	I did not see that that's not the Hulu one
5530060	5536980	That sounds like the better one if you see the clip the guy is like he becomes your hero because he's so sincere
5536980	5543140	He's like no, I think he's unapologetic about it. He's also not unapologetic in the 4chan way
5543140	5545820	He's just sort of he is who he is and he's like no
5545820	5547300	So and then I'm thinking okay
5547300	5551780	I'm gonna have to blow this guy in order to get water and and he just tells the story and you're kind of like oh god
5551780	5556020	There's something so refreshing about his sincerity. He would be a great hype man
5560180	5562180	But I was I
5562580	5566100	Freak out don't don't know but I was saying that same thing
5566100	5569540	I was at I was at a party and I was like talking about that
5569540	5570660	I was like, oh, did you see that clip?
5570660	5573620	But I was telling somebody it was like this guy like he becomes your hero
5573620	5578500	I was just saying the same thing which I thought was like it's not that really that big a position and there was somebody there
5578500	5580140	that was like
5580140	5581520	They chiseled away at it
5581520	5588140	They're like really those those fucking people and that culture of this and that and they kind of like by the end of them
5588260	5591460	Speaking I was like, oh, yeah, I kind of bought into some bullshit
5591460	5598340	Like I think like this person kind of like problematized my worship of some guy that was willing to suck dick for water on camera
5599580	5602740	It was a it was an interesting experience
5602740	5608220	It made me withdraw more from humanity because you you really can't enjoy anything
5608300	5612900	Yeah, you can't you can't even just like poke your head out of the hole and go like that
5613260	5616580	Charred human skin is glinting in the sunlight
5616740	5622700	I'll call that a gem and then someone will go that makes you racist and you're like, you'll be back down here
5625060	5630460	On anything is what I've learned. Yeah, you can you can you can I don't want to call it problematizing because
5631020	5638900	Because that politicizes it but I think it's like bubble bursting like people love to take down people love to they believe to be ironic
5639340	5645820	Yeah, you want to walk onto a playground where one thing is happening and you want to be the person that says what about the other thing?
5645820	5651420	I can't believe people were upset when they found out blink 182 wasn't going to be there. That seems like
5653100	5658780	The greatest news I would have ever heard I'm like, okay, I fucking would have paid double for that shit
5659740	5664860	Blink 182 go fuck yourselves. Wow. I really wish I could remember the one thing
5664860	5669660	I think I had one thing that I really wanted to get to and I can't think of things all the small things
5669660	5671180	Not a good song
5671180	5677740	You don't enjoy. I don't know who is that a song? Yeah from blink 182. You sing it all the small things
5677740	5682020	That's it. That's a song. All right, when I say all things you say small
5684860	5691100	You can't even you can't that you no one has the will to hype man blink 182 they are their own hype men
5692100	5699380	Should we meet should we meet Emily 8 8 o 5 that the work out an audience member is that is it?

5787780	5793020	It's a loaded question. You can either say DH you have inspired not only me but
5794460	5800940	The celestial Vikings of the chat, there's just so many people you have between you and Dave Klein
5801380	5803380	I can tell you it's not only affected me
5804260	5807460	You are just impressive. I'm impressed
5807460	5811020	It's uh, I've had I have a picture from you from the first Harman town that I attended
5811020	5815780	Oh, man, if I can be honest, can it can it may I be on? Yeah, no, go ahead kind of schlumpy. Well
5816540	5819900	Yeah, who would think you know, but and then I'm here now
5820340	5826540	It's kind of a lot but like was that an imitation you from out there is it sound like a real one. No, it was me
5828340	5830340	Here today
5831260	5836900	There was a proper you we have bark wizard here. Yeah. Oh, what's it? What's the celestial Viking?
5837540	5839540	Dave Klein has
5840260	5847860	Given us or given just came up with that name for the for Dan cuz so Dan's a celestial
5847860	5849860	Viking. Yes
5850020	5852020	Dave Klein believes that
5852260	5859100	There that there's a group of chosen people who will go into outer space or something like that. That sounds
5859700	5861700	That's kind of the Harman town like
5862220	5866500	early motto or credo show started with before it died and
5867180	5868740	so it is a
5868740	5875020	Funny kind of like yeah, but he it's it's uh, yeah, like Dave Dave Klein is like
5875020	5881940	I I will say like the crazy thing. It's sorry. Flula. Yeah, why I start
5882260	5887660	I started Instagramming my workouts because I was like, it's the only way I'm gonna keep working out
5887900	5895380	like if I just like it is like this Instagram live feature was sort of like this thing that to me suggested like
5896140	5898140	vanity and like
5898980	5904740	Influentialness or whatever. It's something that like I was like the only way I'm gonna be able to like get on an elliptical
5905180	5910780	And like do these things been $17,000 on GoPros. Yeah, and then it was like well that came later
5910780	5914020	But like and then I was like like, okay, this is a joke. I'm working out
5914020	5917220	It's like if Matt Groening started working out and like Instagram live
5917220	5921020	I was like, I know this is funny. And if I have a heart attack and die, it'll be funny
5921020	5925380	Like I and then and then like like it just went it kept going
5925380	5929740	I kept doing it and then I ran into Dave Klein at a bar at the drawing room and
5930420	5932900	Like around New Year's and he was like, oh brother
5933700	5937660	If you ever want me to come by and I was like dude, I'm not working out with you
5937660	5942080	You're not gonna be in my trainer if you want to come by and hold my Instagram camera
5942080	5945660	that's the thing you can do and he's like absolutely you pewp pewp and
5946620	5952740	He had this way of like humming in low and I was like I was like I trust you then you can do it
5952740	5959180	Whereas like as I've said like any normal trainer, I would just be like after a point when they're like fuck you motherfucker
5959180	5961180	You can do this. I'd be like you're fired
5961340	5966440	And but Dave he can't was like he's just coming over and he expects the best of you and he's like and I'm like
5966440	5968940	Okay, hold the camera and then he like held it and then he's like
5969700	5971700	How about this? I don't even know how he did it
5971700	5978380	How did he it's like he's got me doing fucking yoga and lifting weights. I bought a weight bench. I have a gym in my home
5978740	5983500	Amazing. It's amazing. Anyways, wait, are you into your DMS? Are you in the Suicide Squad or what?
5983500	5989120	Why are you I'm not in the Suicide Squad. I know you don't have to be James. Don't we did it. I don't know
5991380	5994380	Dance in a dance in a different kind of Suicide Squad
5994380	5996380	Oh
6000060	6002060	Hunter Thompson Spalding Gray
6002580	6009540	It's called alcohol when you when you don't want the job done and there's only one job Oh founded by River Phoenix
6013380	6015380	Yeah, rest in peace
6016140	6021100	The groan was like too soon like no to get get out in front of it, but uh, I
6021780	6024420	I've known Dan for a good long time. And when he got his pool
6025380	6029540	To know Dan is to know that he's not a big you're not a water child. You know a water, baby
6031340	6033760	Jeff hates to imagine Dan in the pool
6035300	6040160	It's like it's a year-long obsession with Dan not being a pool
6040300	6043620	He's more afraid of me being in a pool than I was of water
6044500	6047940	But when I first saw Dan at his new crib with the giant-ass pool
6048340	6052060	Dan lives at a Spanish resort apparently like in like Granada and
6053180	6059180	He he had little noseplugs, but now no noseplugs. Whoa, and now you're doing kicky flips under
6059740	6064340	Water without the noseplugs. Yeah and diving in is also that that's a big
6065300	6068900	Like no pun intended. That's a big leap. Yeah, I'm real proud of myself
6069700	6077020	And I don't want to I know I know I know from the previous side of the of the of the fitness class how alienating and boring
6077140	6079140	Shitty it is for people to be like
6080900	6084540	But you know, I'm just like like they make a good point though, it's
6085700	6091380	It's it's it's fantastic and I'm so glad I did it and and I owe it to like like so there's literally like
6092060	6096540	3540 people who will show up on a regular basis and you've always been one of them
6096700	6102380	What but I don't know anything about you by intention because I'm not like like oh, let's get to know these people
6102380	6107640	But I like I like to form relationships with them in the moment and reward them for being there
6107940	6109940	But who are you?
6109980	6111980	Just a small-town
6112300	6114300	girl

6172060	6177840	Wait, is it something you wrote or something Emily wrote? It's a song that I I don't
6179940	6181940	But and then do we need to

6227280	6232160	Jeff tell a story about you meeting Vince Neil at 9-11 or something and I
6233520	6237560	I'm gonna I'm gonna look in GarageBand just to see if I have I never met her at 9-11

6282120	6284440	And he's like fuck that guy
6285840	6290640	And then as we're walking through the lobby I get bumped by a dude by accident and I hear a guy go
6290640	6292800	Oh, sorry, mate, and I'm walking through and he goes
