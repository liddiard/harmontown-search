0	19600	From Hollywood, CA, Meltdown Comics for Meltdown Theater, Harman Town is now in session.
19600	24600	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
24600	39720	Thank you very much.
39720	47480	I was minecrafting and I'm not really ready to do the show.
47480	49920	What happened recently on Minecraft?
49920	53040	Get us up to date on where you were as you left Minecraft.
53040	56280	I have a new base that I built up in the sky.
56280	63480	It's a cube of marble and inside of it is a glass room with these powered spawners that
63480	66400	creates zombies, that bring zombies into the world.
66400	72040	And then there's these machines on all sides that immediately murder them and all of their
72040	77000	brains and flesh go through conduits into a central chest underneath that chamber.
77000	82360	And then I just finished making an elaborate system that like a serial killer's like elaborate
82360	90080	like turn of the century world fair murder castle like sorts their armor off and melts
90080	95480	it down into gold and you know anything that they were carrying like I just sort it all
95480	101720	out and then you take their flesh and their flesh gets teleported into a tesseract that
101720	107840	funnels down into these vats and is combined with sugar from these fields of cane that
107840	110680	I have growing on the roof of my cube.
110680	115240	So the cube is a cube of marble with like sugar cane growing on the roof and it's just
115240	119440	being constantly harvested and that gets turned into sugar and the sugar is combined with
119440	125560	the zombie flesh and forms a nutrient juice that powers my whole operation.
125560	134680	I have these these generators that uh man thank you thank you you should applaud welcome
134680	139400	to Nuremberg 1939.
139400	146280	It does make you feel a little I mean they're zombies but but they're they were created
146280	151520	by me like I did summon them into the world with my machine only to harvest their flesh
151520	152560	and brains and stuff yeah.
152560	155880	Is this part of a menu that happens when you first get the game or?
155880	160960	No no it's probably it's a lot of mod packs I'm playing I've told you I'm playing I told
160960	166400	you Jeff I'm playing yeah we don't talk as much as we used to the Beast infinity mod
166400	170120	pack it's a it's a view if you're interested in it.
170120	176800	You summon zombies only to murder them and harvest their parts to fuel your war engine?
176800	185760	Yes zombie generators they each generate 80 red redstone flux points of energy per tick
185760	192160	a tick is a tenth of a second I think and then so each zombie generator generates 80
192160	195280	then I have like just a wall of them and they all take in this they all run on this
195280	201240	nutrient nutrient distillation and then they funnel the energy into a big giant capacitor
201240	206520	and then that that that charges everything like my jetpack and stuff like that.
206520	211800	Your jetpack oh yeah go ahead go ahead the jetpack wait sir is it a is there a first
211800	215920	person or third person element to this where you're flying around?
215920	218000	It's a first person experience.
218000	223880	So you're on a jetpack flying around through your sky cloud zombie killing?
223880	227120	Yep alone yeah.
227120	230360	Is there any companionship is there anybody out there are you just you're just just you
230360	232880	out there with the zombies?
232880	241400	Just the comforting screams of their I usually put it on mute because it's a little disturbing.
241400	246520	I keep my keep my bedroom far away from where you can hear their their cries of anguish
246520	253320	and confusion I'm sure they're very confused they're like brains what my brains yeah it's
253320	257000	pretty pretty great what I'm doing.
257000	262320	What is I'm not saying this to be glib or smart ass like what is the payoff like what's
262320	263320	the what's the serotonin?
263320	267080	There's no there's no oh you mean like well it's never gonna end if that's what you're
267080	270800	I thought you were asking that like my wife is always asking it's never gonna end she's
270800	277840	like did you win yet no I did not win yet no I I mean what what is the what is the what's
277840	287360	the visceral experience of that like like just getting fatter and it's it's it's it's
287360	294520	a world where every decision you make can can result if you choose it to to in perfect
294520	299680	order it's perfect organization it's like you listen to that I took zombies and I turned
299680	305720	them into electricity and I and their their their pants get turned into gold like I just
305720	310120	everything is you know there's a place for everything and you just sort things and build
310120	315240	them and you can you can create anything it's like you know it's like digital Legos and
315240	320480	it's a that's I need that in my life because you know I don't I don't you know nobody has
320480	326000	that in real life that's the because the rest of life is too disordered is too too and there's
326000	331040	no result you know if you could you could go out in the street and the lady could go help help my
331040	336200	my wallet and and like there's a guy like stealing a wallet and you're like he's kind of smaller
336200	342080	than me I think I'll I'm gonna do the right thing here and then you go up and go hey get your damn
342080	347200	hands off her and the guy just stabs you and the and the woman's like ha ha we tricked you we're
347200	355240	like a we're like a pair of people that do this and take his blood take his blood so let's get
355240	360840	out of here and you turn his pants into gold you know that's yeah in real life you could you
360840	367000	could be the zombie that's generated by a auto-spawner our friend Annie from South by Southwest is here
367000	371720	tonight you think you think she she you know you think in her Minecraft game she would say give me
371720	382440	spinal stenosis like she she are you here Annie okay there you are yeah hello Annie people didn't
382440	393000	like my off-handed glib use of you as an analogy Annie Annie's here she can she can confirm now I'm
393000	397960	so I was glad to hear you were gonna be here do did you just schedule a LA trip by coincidence
397960	409160	or did you oh you live here what were you doing in South by Southwest okay do you want to come up
409160	415880	here is it is it is it easy enough well can we move that table so she can she needs her walking
418600	422200	oh really okay you can do it let's welcome Annie over to wherever she is
430440	435480	hello Annie resplendent and pink sweater and pink bow thank you
436440	442360	okay so we met you at South by Southwest which was very loud and I didn't listen to the broadcast
442360	446920	I don't know if it was like super loud too loud for the listeners or anything oh man I couldn't
446920	449880	tell because last time we were there it was the same thing but then I listened to it I was like
449880	453560	well it's not so bad good thing we didn't spend the whole podcast like going hey what's with these
453560	457480	people talking because because I when I listened to it I was like yeah you can't really you know
457480	462760	you can hear like a background sound effect of it's like we're doing a show to Fuddruckers or something
462760	468760	and the but but but this time it was just unavoidable like everyone that came up had to
468760	472840	address it we went over to the bar a thousand times and said keep it down didn't we send you
472840	476840	over there at some point my friend Jessica went and she was like and we were like cheering her on
476840	480360	and Erin went over Erin was the best because she would go over and be like hi what's your name
480360	486440	what are you talking about shut the fuck up it's like it was perfect I don't know yeah they gotta
486440	492040	they gotta figure we gotta ask more questions before we go back to South by yeah I thought
492040	496840	this time the place would be sealed up because of yahoo let's ask for a theater next time well
496840	500120	the open bar was the problem because everybody was standing around the bar and everybody wanted
500120	503480	drinks then you'd stand there and talk to people at the bar because obviously you can't really hear
503480	507960	what's going on at the show but also those people at the bar they were not at the harm in town no
507960	512920	a lot of them were just you know yeah they were just hanging out like like talking about like like
512920	520760	e-wallets and stuff um so we we met you there and I don't know how much they could hear but
520760	524360	we asked you about your your walker and then found out you have this tragic
525480	531320	spinal stenosis you were walking down the hall one day and down just fell down and found out
531320	534760	you're not going to be able to walk over again it's going to get kind of kind of worse as it goes
536360	541320	and uh and then and then it came up that you're and you're a big Annie Edison fan and that your
541320	546840	name is Annie with one end and that you're you have a blog where you talk about what Annie wears
546840	552680	and that you were bummed out about the uh move from skirts to pants which I I a move I made to
552680	559240	be a decent human being uh I understood your your logic behind all of it you were just wrong yeah
559240	566760	yeah I know um it's fine what was your guilt about that Danny you feel like you're being
566760	574600	exploitative yeah yeah I will I'm looking at you know what uh that character does
575240	581320	outfits differently I was like I'm not going like oh that old innocent school girl thing I'm a pig
581320	587320	like I and also like the act the character is is growing and changing so I thought like well
587320	594040	is she just like in this stasis you know does she just have like 11 000 you know short skirts and
594040	599240	pairs of tights and and and cardigan sweaters and like in this closet it's like half cardigans
600040	606200	right so we put you in charge of wardrobe for for the finale episode there's a there's a couple of
606200	611320	scenes where she'll she'll be she's dressed in accordance with your your wishes you you gotten
611320	616440	you gotten you we actually connected you with our wardrobe supervisor it's true she still has not
616440	622040	responded to me wait wait I'm not like trying to be like hey this is really I'm very upset at all
622040	625400	this but now I asked like a bunch of questions and I think it was like a little too much like I was
625480	629000	like literally three tweets with the questions like this and this and this and that you know
629000	633880	like it's like I think I think it was overwhelming yeah and also you're associated with me so and
635720	641960	the people that work underneath me are not big fans of uh of they they last night was the rap
641960	647000	party for season six and it's always a tradition where I I come up with a new way to promise that
647000	653480	I'll figure out how to run a show and all the new people are like yeah good speech man and all
653560	659480	the like you know the ronda the prop master for six years is over in the corner like if she smoked
659480	666520	she'd just have a cigarette jangling like yeah it's always gonna be different he's really learning
666520	672200	wait so you already shot the uh the Annie last episode then yep yep yeah we tweeted me a picture
672200	676120	actually of it um I don't know how they they managed to find this but I guess there was like
676120	679640	somebody released a picture of like everybody on set and then somebody tweeted it to me and was
679720	684600	like hey this is your outfit did it did it does it all right did we did we get it yeah no I mean
684600	691000	well it's not really a purple sweater I would definitely not call that purple right I literally
691000	694760	what happened I wish I could I wish this was a more glorious story but literally what happened
694760	700760	was they sent me pictures of two outfits literally in the combinations that they were in on the show
700760	705320	so they and they had so all the items had previously been worn and it was only two outfits
705320	710520	so what I said was can we swap that sweater for this dress because I at least then it's a new
710520	714680	combination of things she's already worn all right so well you were that was my amazing
714680	722360	costume designing you were as uh yeah welcome to Hollywood Annie it's great to be here chef
723000	728360	I did have a I did have a little bit of a shit head uh shit head shit fit tantrum uh I remember
728360	731480	on the way to a meeting because I was like looking at these emails and I was going like wait what
731560	736200	there was a picture of a black sweater and then I was like the only thing I remember is a purple
736200	740520	sweater that's all that's all I know I could have I could have like how is that the one thing that's
740520	745480	like different and then they said that you were like in contact with them so after a point I was
745480	751160	like okay as long as I look like a good person Spencer that was my goal here this is the real
751160	757240	yeah no Spencer got in contact with me actually and then and I also talked to Kevin and somebody
757480	762760	else and things have worked out what do you what's what are you holding oh I'm holding a fan because
762760	768040	I'm afraid at any moment I'm going to heat up and exhaust and be like needing this it's a little
768040	774840	worm in here you know why very popular podcast it's like zombie generators like you could you
774840	780280	could you could you could power a marble base with this this room all this all these brains and flesh
780280	784520	what what is it what is a marble base afford you like what I don't know it just looks pretty it's
784520	791000	white okay everything down down on the earth what is your what is your home base are you building
791000	797320	a gavilla like a like a like a home like a like fortress of solitude what do you have it's good
797320	803480	it's like a big computer kind of it's takes in or takes in everything you know like is there an
803480	809720	architectural aesthetic to it or is it like what's a white cube with like multiple it's not about
809720	813640	it's not about aesthetics it's about function about the aesthetic of function it's like when
813640	820040	you look at it you're like this guy's functioning like and he doesn't give a shit right but anything
820040	825560	is to power like ancient Rome functioned uh but they still had like they would they would
825560	829720	show a couple columns when I'm finished with everything being working yeah I make I could
829720	835000	take a chisel and I can make some some things you can yeah can you make it look artistic can yeah
835000	842200	you can yeah you like it now I have no idea what we're talking about but I do like the idea that
842200	846600	one day you would graduate from function like you when you got everything you wanted when you
846600	851640	achieved the heights of whatever you wanted that you would like start becoming like an artistic yeah
852440	858360	yeah I would I would I would I would save that for last yeah I would be like okay now I care
858360	864280	if there's a pot in the corner with a plant in it but up until the moment when you're a god I'm
864280	870200	talking about like if I if I were a third person minecraft or walking up like I ran afoul of your
870200	876360	kingdom and I saw out in the distance a giant building right which is where you dwell right
877000	881640	I would just see a big cube you would see first of all you would go oh my god what happened
881640	888120	like because there there's just these giant rectangular holes in the earth where I just
888120	893400	I built an ender quarry and I just put it on a you know a diamond upgrade and it just goes
894920	899320	and I just like scoop up the earth down to bedrock so there's just lava and that that
899320	905480	so far so far that's ancient Rome like as you get to Rome there's just quarries and mines and
905480	909720	chain gangs and bad things happening yeah he's just like you'd be like oh my god what horrible
909720	915240	monster did all this and then you'd look up on the sky and he's go is that the sun uh no it's my home
915240	921560	are you living the sky yes I live in the sky you live in a marble cube in the sky yes I do okay
921560	929720	that's I like that that's good do you play minecraft Andy no I do not you play video games
929720	933800	I do play video games I do I'm actually really addicted I don't know if anybody
934920	938040	knows this really old game that was on Linux called chips challenge
940360	946040	there was a version in the Microsoft entertainment pack in the 90s anyway I just discovered that
946040	950360	some amazing humans with way too much time in their hands have put all these level packs
950360	953880	and you can actually play it on the iPhone so that's actually what I waste all my time on is
953880	958440	playing this like fake version of chips challenge because it's like it's like my childhood on my
958440	962760	phone is it like an ASCII game what's the no it's just like when the graphics are pretty shitty
962760	967800	you know it's like it's a it's a it's two-dimensional and you have to collect chips in the original
967800	971560	game and then knock off its coins and then but it's all puzzles so like you have to like push
971560	975960	the block into the water to make sure that the creature doesn't come get you and yada yada yada
975960	981000	starting to sound like Minecraft I like it yeah it's it's definitely like a a precursor
981000	984520	except this is all puzzle-based so it's like everything is like you have to get to the end
984520	988600	and how are you going to do that so and some of these puzzles are extremely tricky I mean they're
988600	994360	just ridiculous do you ever play mist oh god I love this you have you can get all of those
994360	1000520	too for the iPhone now mist riven and the seventh guest like yeah buy them now they are amazing
1000520	1004920	it's like and it's like the perfect graphics for a furred iPhone they're a little dated but still
1005720	1011320	but yeah but you can totally get them all sorry my wife is texting me oh we thought you were
1011320	1016520	downloading games now how do you know she was asking you from your pocket she was a certain
1016520	1024120	certain kind of vibrate it no you pulled your phone out and said my wife was texting me well
1024120	1027480	I didn't know I brought it out anybody could have been texting me but then I saw it was her
1028280	1033400	she texted me Minecraft joke question why did the sailor bring iron and gold into his boat
1033960	1035400	answer he needed oars
1047720	1049320	I like the direction the show is taken
1050680	1055240	so like like it really has become our generation's prairie home companion including
1055240	1067240	including the boredom it's just me just Sarah got her brand new hat a blueberry pie and
1068440	1072600	went to church and it's kind of like if you're wondering through you just mean why would anyone
1072600	1078600	watch this which is what Dino asked um but right now Dan like like as of two days ago
1079800	1084120	community is done yeah yeah I've wrapped on community I'm done I'm just editing now
1084120	1088360	I was there yesterday at the uh at CBS Radford and the uh where you shoot whose lens anyway it's
1088360	1093400	this literally the soundstage directly above where they shoot community so in the hallway
1093400	1099640	where our dressing rooms are it goes Ryan Stiles Jeff winger uh it's not it's not the actors names
1099640	1105720	it's the character names and uh it's a character named Ryan Stiles coming up pardon there's a
1105720	1109720	character named Ryan Stiles coming up well no he's a real person well I knew that yeah that's why
1109720	1113560	I see that'd be a really interesting reference to make you know like character name Ryan Stiles
1113560	1119000	but sadly in all the doors for all the community characters it said uh vacant clean room
1120680	1125240	and I've been there like several weeks when it said like occupied like don't don't come in here
1125240	1130440	this is Annie's room this is Jeff's room this is our bedroom and now fucking do as you do as you
1130440	1135480	like yeah and and all Danny Pooty's like okay you can come in clean it up and there's just like blood
1135480	1146840	everywhere this is six dead hitchhikers tons of uh weird tic-tac-toe gamers played in his own poop
1146840	1154440	yeah the the the the um the the Harvey Keitel character that works at Yahoo comes in and looks
1154440	1162600	it over and then they nods to the cleaning crew cover it up make it disappear well what were the
1162600	1172040	numbers last night uh 50 million downloads sir make it so it didn't happen by the way uh
1173480	1178200	everybody in the world watches community now we know now that we're not being measured by Nielsen
1179320	1187880	yeah like I probably should have made the season better but uh it could have been a real double
1187880	1193240	triumph for me to be at my my peak as our viewership was and our support from the other
1193240	1197960	side but well you're finding out that because Nielsen is so flawed that people more people
1197960	1203080	were watching than you thought yeah here's a fundamental way it's flawed guess guess who wants
1203080	1208680	to fill out a diary of what they watched and sell it to Colgate like like Jay Leno's audience does
1208680	1213720	like that's not that is a dying species of television viewer and then there's this
1213720	1217880	sought-after demo called the uh what's their what's or who's it's what are these college kids
1217880	1223720	whatever you call them millennials upscales uh uh roamers sand people i don't know what they're
1225480	1239320	bantas nerf herders low bows tranks um but uh you know they don't watch they don't watch tv on tv
1239320	1245480	they they certainly if they do they're not watching it on a Nielsen box tv so oh surprise surprise
1246280	1250520	you know yahoo knows how to count the clicks and guess what holy shit
1251320	1258680	jesus christ like you always knew how many people i can't say why not well because it's yahoo's
1258680	1263400	business like i don't really they're they're it's their business like you know like they're
1263400	1267960	that's their i don't know they they're they're not necessarily going to like publish you know
1267960	1273560	like that was Nielsen's like business was we're an into we're this contractor and everyone give us
1273560	1277880	money and then we'll announce your ratings and we'll be like this referee that was their business
1277880	1282360	netflix is not doing that they're a private you know thing and they go how many people are watching
1282360	1288200	house of cards fuck you uh do you think house of cards is a good show do you feel like everyone's
1288200	1293160	watching it yes or no like like stick it you know there's no commercials so with yahoo though they
1293160	1297800	have to tell advertisers obviously so they they have they have data and they're just i'm not really
1297800	1301720	asking and they're not telling but they're you know lips were loose at the drunken rat party
1302840	1309640	enough for me to go holy shit that's what i always would have guessed times two or three
1310440	1314200	i always always knew there was like way more people watching this shit than
1314760	1319560	than uh than than whatever that point nine represented are you saying that nbc and sony
1319560	1323880	didn't know that or didn't care i think that i think that the dirty little i think that the
1323880	1328440	last 10 years it's been a dirty little secret that the neilson's has not a totally effective
1328440	1333080	tabulation of viewership over time we've gotten caught in this cycle or like the whole point of
1333080	1337160	the neilson system is advertising so if they're not watching commercials who cares if they're
1337160	1342120	watching but the creatives all the creatives want is for numbers of people to watch their show
1342120	1347320	that's how you measure their success and so now we're in this weird you know flux period where
1347320	1351960	it's like okay live plus seven day live plus 30 day yahoo doesn't even fucking like they're
1351960	1357800	they're like live plus 30 day who who gives a shit like that yahoo knows more information than
1357800	1364280	the cia about like like like viewership they they really are on the internet they know um they they
1364280	1369400	just have like clouds and bell curves and things like they well they're they're like here's the
1369400	1375640	here's the here's the amount of people that are are emotionally uh moved to purchase things by
1375640	1381160	looking at one of alison brie's feet you know like that they they don't like they're not worried
1381160	1386600	about views and like like like the week of and the night of and the month of what do you think
1386600	1390520	people purchase when they look at one of our feet it's probably like a boot or something i don't know
1391720	1393160	look at that foot i need a boot
1396360	1401880	i say i was just using the classic example kumail tweeted uh uh at one point he said his goal is to
1401880	1407560	become so successful that uh that one of the one of the google auto fill-ins is kumail najiani feet
1409320	1413960	it's like a typical thing for female celebrities how you doing are you uh bursting into flame or
1413960	1419000	anything all right well we got some things to talk about so yeah i'm successful uh
1421640	1427240	so will there be a season seven or is that it is community done i don't know man what do you want
1427800	1431240	are you allowed to say don't i mean i gotta talk to my therapist about this
1432360	1436120	i don't i really don't know i just damn pretend i'm your therapist right now pretend no one's
1436120	1440440	listening i just put your phone down put your phone down i want to put your phone down i want
1440440	1445720	to play minecraft no you don't yeah i know you want to play minecraft and i know that if you had
1445720	1451080	your way that you would only play minecraft but let's say let's say there was a clamor and a great
1451080	1456680	gnashing of teeth and wailing for another season of community by anybody either by yahoo or by
1456760	1462520	the fans or whatever would you say yes under certain circumstances i can't tell you right now
1462520	1468680	because i'm like i'm just yeah you have it because you have bubble throat no i have liquid mouth
1471080	1476440	i i i can't i can't say that was a that's a perfectly normal thing i drank
1478360	1484280	then answer answer a question right now i can't talk to her now because swallow a little bit of
1484280	1489080	liquid in my mouth or an ice cube you know it's normal it's not to be mocked
1491720	1495160	i think you're damn as your therapist i think you're kind of evading the question right now
1496200	1501720	um under under certain circumstances like i know i mean i there's so many variables
1501720	1506200	can you can you imagine a circumstance where you would say yes to yes of course i can imagine a
1506200	1513560	circumstance where you know hitler and i would hang out but it involves him hating jews less and
1514280	1518440	coming back to life and like maybe being on a timeline where he didn't kill a bunch of people
1518440	1522840	and like like having a full mustache i mean it's like there's a certain point where he's not hitler
1522840	1534120	anymore he's just sam elliott and and jeff how jeff how would it go if sam elliott was in charge
1534120	1539640	of the third rike you know the jews are a bunch of assholes
1548040	1552520	the jews abide the jews abide
1555480	1563800	oh boy um yeah so very popular television show uh very popular do you think it's going to come
1563800	1570760	back i know it doesn't okay look in no necessary order let me throw some fucking variables at you
1571400	1576520	do you does alison brie want to do uh i don't i i don't know the answer to any question what does
1576520	1581800	her left foot want to do like we don't know like like i mean the actors contracts are up you know
1581800	1590120	that's that is a big deal okay so let's say uh ratings are good yahoo goes hey uh you want to
1590120	1594600	try to marshal the troops and bring it back do you say fuck that shit we're done or do you say
1594600	1599000	let's see what the actors think i well i would say let's see what the actors think and then there's
1599000	1605160	my start from there but but but i just a million things have to be different i have to get my head
1605160	1609960	out of my ass and learn how to run a show so that you know you're never going to learn how to run a
1609960	1614680	show you've proven that you like this is the way that you run a show right like you like you you
1614680	1618360	run the show the way that you run shows then nobody good will work for me we had such a great crew
1618360	1625800	this year man they were so good our new dp buzz so so good i would work for you dan yeah like this
1625800	1632120	is your first year though like you like see then i'd have that energy and i wouldn't hate you so
1632120	1636200	did you say that you that you you pissed off around to the prop lady or she's on your team
1636200	1641400	it's just always hard it's hard to work for me because i like i'm just like the scripts come
1641400	1647320	in last minute and so if you're the person that makes uh uh the pants then you're like
1647320	1652600	i can't make good pants now because i just saw that this person's wearing pants if i had known
1652600	1657560	they were wearing pants a week ago i could have made the best pants ever i like working the way
1657560	1661960	that i work but but i'm not bringing out the best in the people that work for me you know like they
1661960	1669000	don't get a chance to like look at a script and like like hmm pants huh i've got an idea
1670200	1675560	they just have to be like hey here's some pants that's not you know you you know that's called
1675560	1679480	the wardrobe department right yeah the pant the the pants people
1681880	1685000	they really are the people at the wrap party at the end of the year that are always like they
1685000	1689080	have like that that that serious drama about them for all the hell i put everyone through
1689080	1694360	it's always the wardrobe people that are like you challenge me
1694360	1704280	and i like the results come on you make pants
1707000	1713160	take it easy it's just just pants like worst case scenario a bunch of naked
1713160	1717800	beautiful people on tv everyone wants that anyway
1717800	1726280	and they also come with their own clothes but they couldn't pull off a purple fucking cardigan
1727080	1730680	don't let's not rag on him too much there's only so many wardrobe people in the in the city you
1730680	1738520	know um but uh yeah our our production designer our prop master our wardrobe supervisor uh they've
1738520	1744440	been they're old veterans of the harm and effect and uh they're there's some great ladies they're
1744440	1749240	they're real heroes i forgot my shoes last night right right before getting dressed for whose line
1749240	1754280	that's us taping a whose lens anyway and getting dressed i look in my bag i forgot my shoes at home
1754280	1759640	and i i go to the wardrobe people's like i got no shoes and they ran to marshall's and bought me
1759640	1765400	some shoes that were a good size too small and so i sent a pa to my place and he got stuck in
1765400	1772360	traffic so for the first two hours of a four hour taping uh really small shoes and then i i kept
1772360	1776440	playing jar jar binks uh in a game and and wane brady kept coming and cutting my throat
1776440	1779400	because he hates jar jar binks that's a brave choice
1782440	1787560	wait to kill jar jar to play jar jar to kill him to you know to be anti-jar jar at an improv
1787560	1792600	scene when i i broke a cuff link so i had small shoes and one cuff link on it was it was a rough
1792600	1802040	night for me oh man fists with your toes fists with your toes all right so uh okay dan i have to
1802040	1808840	say this um there's you when you're working and you're in your manic like this shit to get done
1808840	1813640	mode and then when there's you when you're not working and it's you right you're seated the
1813640	1818120	entire show well this is this is the first time you've been seated this long is it because we
1818440	1823240	are you sitting because you're trying to be sensitive to me no i just no i actually love
1823240	1829000	sitting you can't stand so it doesn't matter if the guest is is is able to uh run laps around the
1829000	1833640	stage that'd be really funny like you thought that would make me feel comfortable i'm one of you
1833640	1844520	i'm sitting i can't sit i had a i had a girlfriend once who uh i swear to god um the um suspend your
1844600	1850600	disbelief everybody she was she was uh she told me about a show she was in she used to perform for
1850600	1855640	these there was this guy that that that that had somehow stumbled into the kind of like gold mine
1855640	1861880	of writing special shows for school kids i think i've maybe talked about this on the podcast before
1861880	1865800	but like she was in a couple of his shows so like he would write these like educational shows and
1865800	1871480	there would be like musicals and one of them that he wrote was for it was like to you know this is
1871480	1876280	where the language gets difficult because what is the point is to raise awareness is it to comfort
1876280	1882360	is it to benefit but it just has that he didn't he just had that specialness vibe on it because
1882360	1890840	there was like this show he wrote that was about a um a kid in a wheelchair who uh goes to a magical
1890840	1898120	land uh where everyone is a car and and the insinuation is like like i was like so confused
1898200	1904280	i had so many questions i was like so is the idea does he ever does does does the kid come back and
1904280	1910920	and and and be like now i feel better about she's like no he stays there but he's happier
1910920	1916840	because everyone else has wheels and i'm like that's not does does anyone check this guy's
1916840	1922200	like license to write for children like it's just like the kids in a wheelchair that he gets
1922200	1927560	transported to heaven to car world and then the cars are like they have these car songs
1927560	1930840	and she would shoot because she had a couple of them memorized and was like
1930840	1940920	everybody's doing the traffic jam do the damn it do the traffic jam it was uh i was so
1940920	1947640	like intrigued by this guy and his career um yeah they just we have wheels too um
1948760	1952760	anyways that that's what that made me think of that the idea that i would be sitting for
1952760	1959000	for your benefit uh to help you out like a magical car uh thank you i was getting really
1959000	1963080	jealous are we finding out that you brought any up just so you could sit down i well i
1963080	1966760	i often bring guests up just so i could sit down because when the guests come up i can't stand
1966760	1972280	there so yes i often bring people up so i can sit down annie i brought up so that she could verify
1972280	1977080	that i'm like the world's greatest showrunner because totally turned the wardrobe department
1977080	1983320	over to her and the result was an almost purple sweater but we almost got it done people we almost
1983320	1991240	got it done yeah it's just the headlines you know tomorrow tmz dan helps annie all right uh are we
1991240	1996920	gonna get more sit down rapper i thought that was the funniest thing ever like lazy lazy sit down
1996920	2003160	rapper i love the smattering of applause i get where everybody else is like why would you even
2003160	2008440	bring that up i wanted to i wanted to suss through something i blocked adam goldberg on twitter
2011240	2016200	and i can't really remember why i just know that i did i know why i did
2018600	2022360	i don't know if anybody if it's possible like you all have your phones in the audience like if
2022360	2026600	somebody can pull up like a timeline and look at like because i i was hashtag when i blocked
2026600	2033320	somebody i hashtag at harmon block 2015 uh and so if you look i don't know if you can find the
2033320	2040360	what he said right before i did that uh i'm so curious like what he did wrong was it because he
2040360	2044600	said one thing or because it was too many things in a row no it was like it was like it was just i
2044600	2049880	wasn't i was in the wrong mood at the wrong time like i i said something like i don't i was in a
2049880	2056200	certain zone and like said something and then he he was like snarky and dot connecty about it like
2056200	2061960	and i and i and i was just like fuck you fuck you you fucking jackass to like collaborate on why
2061960	2069160	millennials are eight-year-olds oh okay yeah oh yeah no yeah okay so i was just in a pissy mood i
2069160	2073640	i i tweeted like an anti-millennial tweet i said i said remember when millennials were eight years
2073640	2078040	old and we said they're the future and now it's the future and sure enough we're all fucking eight
2078040	2084680	years old um uh and and then he then i don't know what he said he said like well can you elaborate
2084680	2092280	on that and i said fuck you i said can you can you can you can you live without a source of
2092280	2098840	something to react to fuck you harmon block wait you have a hashtag for blocking people
2099880	2100440	sorry what
2103400	2106360	oh that's what i said to him feel free to exist as a collection of reactions
2107320	2110280	did you look that up right now or did you do you know that from memory
2112600	2119160	oh she looked at that that's better thank you i actually heard two different people called me
2119160	2123560	to tell me about hashtag harm and block 2015 they're like Dan's blocking all these people and
2123560	2129400	like literally trying to talk to me as though this is like gossip that is necessary in life
2129400	2132520	like what are you taking right now Dan what is this i got the ADD real bad
2136360	2139720	steady as a rock
2144760	2151000	but he shoots with his hands totally legal got a prescription got the ADD real bad
2154360	2159720	does it get you high no it's actually i'm now i'm taking it like remember they warned you in the
2159720	2164120	after school specials like and after a while you're taking it just to stay normal yeah that's me
2164120	2171560	because i was i was taking it to like stay awake uh and finish writing and uh now as a
2172200	2177080	so now i wake up and like because i have to taper off of it because it's like otherwise my eyelids
2177080	2182840	are like anvils like it's it's it's it's it's exactly what you would think it's just a cartoonish
2182840	2188520	inversion of what you get from the pill is like the you're if you're coming off of it it's like
2188520	2194840	holy shit i'm really tired and super able to focus wait no what do i take it for focusing
2196120	2199080	super unable to focus something about focus
2203000	2211400	annie why one in um well i know i know it's the question that's been on everybody's minds
2211400	2220280	um actually so it's uh it's short for my legal name um my my name ends in annie and at some point
2221000	2225320	my friends and i thought it was clever for me to go by annie like for all those girls in the world
2225320	2231800	whose name ends with annie or anny you know the tiffany's the britney's the all the stephanie
2231800	2236760	over there which which one are you are you stephanie you think i am you're stephanie all the way i'm
2236760	2242040	not a stephanie i am a britney i was gonna guess yeah but i but yeah so i always hated it and i was
2242040	2246840	like and i was also really into the ann of green gables books so i was like well annie is kind of
2246840	2253160	like ann and i can be that kind of dork so it was uh dan why one in
2258680	2260280	just seemed like a good place to stop bro
2260280	2269080	uh yeah all right well i don't i don't want you cooking up here and i gotta i'm gonna i'm gonna
2269080	2274760	bring out more people i think so yeah give a hand for annie and do you need help getting down
2284760	2286600	now that she's gone i can stand up again
2286600	2294840	you're trying to mock annie by standing up the whole rest of the show i don't know i just feel
2294840	2299240	like this is what i've always done if somebody comes up i sit down and somebody's not up here
2299240	2306840	i stand up i thought maybe it would give me a little boost of energy because god knows that
2306840	2312360	medicine won't kick in until midnight it takes a while to kick in yeah do you do you feel like
2312360	2316920	kicking in yeah not not these days i can't take it wrong because when i do it it's like doing
2316920	2323240	just a bag of coke like i guess i i i i once took one at 7 p.m and i was wallpapering my apartment
2323240	2330440	at 4 a.m i'm like i got i got shit to do it's like fucking doodle doo motherfucker if you've
2330440	2335080	never taken it and you and you take that that's the effect or if you don't take it for a really
2335080	2340360	long time then that's the that is the effect and i believe i always assumed like that if that if
2340440	2346040	it's having that effect on you that means you don't have add right um uh but my friend has
2346040	2352280	add she takes it and her memory comes back right and she also goes to bed at 9 p.m or 10 p.m yeah
2352280	2356840	but as i started taking it more like like because i got a real prescription so i was like okay now
2356840	2361560	i'm taking it i did it didn't even out and i did feel as i said like i felt like there were
2361560	2366680	positive effects that had nothing to do with staying awake and and you know spencers spencers
2366760	2372360	kind of convinced that i that i have add but you know that's just coming from his expertise
2373320	2379160	as a dungeon master should we bring him out and talk to him about my add spencer criton
2379160	2383480	daaaaaaad
2393160	2395800	hey guys how's everybody doing
2398520	2405960	that's good spencer uh what do you base your uh your findings that dan might have uh adhd or add
2405960	2410760	it's funny i just like uh was missing my cue i almost didn't come in because i was just
2410760	2416200	explaining to dimore the answer to this very question it's just uh i mean i don't know it's
2416200	2422520	it's hard to explain but my little brother is really add and apparently i'm pretty add
2422520	2429080	according to doctors and stuff i don't know if anyone buys that but um so i mean my doctor would
2429080	2438680	yeah just according to your doctor we all have ad but i've seen glaucoma i've uh i've seen
2442200	2448120	well that's my doctor those are two totally different doctors yeah but uh no i work with
2448120	2454280	the guy i see his uh his behavior his antics at work and it's just it's very uh to me it just
2454280	2460360	seems like a guy who has add you know no offense dan you do great work but uh just your mannerisms
2460360	2469480	they seem very uh yeah deficit in terms of attention what do you what do you think uh
2469480	2474760	what do you what do you what's your view of this season like like like do you have any any uh
2474760	2480040	like like people are probably curious like what what happened uh you know you're sitting and
2480040	2485480	sitting there the whole time what happened yeah uh i don't know you have any interesting
2485480	2494280	insights about about my work no i mean i i don't know it's it's i i feel like people say it it's
2494280	2499880	just like it's it's all it's all coming from you i mean obviously the writers do uh great work but
2499880	2505720	at the end of the day uh everything that is on screen is happened because of something in your
2505720	2511320	brain and uh as such you know it's it's lame to give the other writers credit
2514680	2521320	spencer what is your day-to-day task at the show okay so i get in usually dan still sleep or he's
2521320	2526200	ambiguously in his office potentially asleep so i don't want to bother him and what time of day
2526200	2533000	are we talking uh you know anywhere from 7 a.m to 9 30 he depends on uh you know the night before
2533000	2538680	and uh when i when i determine that he is in fact awake i try and ask him what he what he needs
2538680	2545480	what he needs if he needs coffee or food or something and uh then i i go do that and uh
2545480	2552840	i sit around and uh i basically repeat that routine for you know the whole time it's great
2552840	2556760	and other than that i'm just sitting around and listening and observing are you in the writer's
2556840	2563800	room or not so much this season it was uh it was a hot office and there wasn't as many chairs i
2563800	2569160	would sit my room is right outside the office and uh the walls were like paper thin so i could hear
2569160	2577960	everything all at all times and uh yeah do you feel like do you have ambitions to like write
2577960	2583400	your own stuff and like maybe have a show of your own yeah definitely i just uh don't think i'm like
2583400	2588600	good at anything so i i don't know how i could do it do you feel at your time uh listening to
2588600	2592840	the walls like community might have prepared you in some way like have you learned stuff certainly
2592840	2597320	i think knowing how a writer's room works is a skill i don't know if it's something that they're
2597320	2603080	gonna like look at and be like oh we gotta get this guy but i think that it's certainly something
2603080	2607800	that does actually help because you have a you have an expectation and you kind of understand
2607800	2613960	the packing order and just the workflow and how things go so i mean i think it's valuable for that
2613960	2621720	reason also you know you learn you learn about writing are you writing your own stuff no i've
2621720	2627160	written a couple things but i i got off the wagon i gotta start are you one of those types i'm not
2627160	2631160	like i have friends that are writers and the reason why i'm not a stand-up or a writer is because i
2631160	2634760	don't think of comedy in terms of jokes like stand-up friends of mine they get up and they
2634760	2638840	write jokes and they want to get up and do material and writers wake up in the morning
2638840	2642840	and go i have it i want to i have to make a show about a guy that does this thing or a girl that
2642840	2646440	does this thing i i don't think in terms of ideas like that are you one of those people
2647320	2653320	do you think of premises premises i think of ideas in terms of like traps and monsters usually
2655000	2660600	so it's it's kind of it takes some creative work to turn that into like a script or a joke
2661480	2665960	are you are you a story kind of guy like do you i mean obviously we know that you're good at like
2665960	2671800	character and and character development and creation and certainly trap development i i
2671800	2677720	guess you'd say i guess you'd say i'm more of a world builder in all honesty like i'll think about
2677720	2683080	things and then it's like oh yeah and the pizza story goes at it uh it has this guy and he you
2683080	2686920	know has a mom that he's paying for cancer or something what does he pay for cancer
2687800	2697160	um other people get it for free but uh no but so just you know world building it's really
2697160	2704440	throwing your money away it's paying for kids but so that's that's usually how my mind goes
2704440	2708680	i would i could see you like writing a show because you're very gifted but i could also
2708680	2713400	see you having like you know there's these myth buster guys you know like i like that
2713560	2717960	show i watch myth busters but i you i would watch a show where spencer like is busting traps or i
2717960	2726600	don't know like busting traps trap busters trap sensors trap sensors oh it would be interesting
2726600	2731080	to have a show just like like like kind of uh i don't know how you do it without hurting people
2731080	2736920	but like the idea of like like just traps like people traps like like like like i don't know
2736920	2741800	just doing weird shit to people it's the new challenge rooms you know i would take this down
2741800	2745400	if you were going to make that show if you were the head of a network and you came to me the junior
2745400	2751080	head of the network and said is there a way to do a show without hurting people or there's traps
2751080	2756120	and people trying to evade traps and maybe some people get cotton traps i would say well the first
2756120	2762680	thing i know is we got to get spencer quitting it on this news yeah they have um they have uh
2762680	2766920	they have these like uh things that you can go to you know like those games we were talking about
2766920	2773240	uh mist um you know they have those games on the ipad like escape the room like the room yeah like
2773240	2776920	like escape the room is the name of the genre is that something like that like like they have
2776920	2782360	live action escape the room like events that you can you can buy a ticket to and go to and you're
2782360	2788440	like in a room and there's like a guy chained up like a zombie and the chain is getting gradually
2788440	2793320	longer i guess yeah but and then you have to like figure out like these kind of like esoteric
2793320	2798200	puzzles and things and i wouldn't i wouldn't i don't think i would enjoy that i would i it's
2798200	2804600	fun well i'm sure it's not it's not fun it's horrible we did you went and did one can you
2804600	2808760	come and talk to us about it i really are you willing to come up here you don't you don't have
2808840	2811560	to okay come on up i just want to hear

2854520	2858440	oh boy this is not the vendor's fault
2861320	2865800	but just a like a tiny little bit of that's like i have no idea if uh if wicked is a good
2865800	2879000	play or not it makes your eyeballs wiggle it's teeth grindingly um wonderful um the uh okay but
2879000	2886520	continue so what so there's this building in new york from new york but um you go in and
2886520	2890440	it's a bunch of goofy actors and we're familiar with new york what show did you see
2895800	2900680	nice den den during the world's longest least merited camera take
2906120	2912760	doesn't even make sense because we're in l.a yeah i mean way more so i mean there's nothing
2912760	2918280	but actors here new york has a couple people who's selling fish what was the show called again
2918280	2922440	it's called the room and it's just like a big building and you go through all the rooms and
2922440	2926760	and you are you with a group of people yeah and you have to try to figure it out and then as a
2926760	2931480	group yeah you're talking it out with each other yeah it's just really there's a bunch of people
2931480	2938760	that are like pretending to give you a hard time but like they're prepaid performers that are like
2938760	2947960	look it's not even my idea to be here yeah they're like people like me that have to deal with this
2947960	2953080	like i'm not going to say what race that guy is but he's wearing a flannel shirt and like
2953080	2958360	with like a thermal shirt underneath it and he's like salt of the earth like reminding
2958360	2963160	you that you're privileged and like that that's the first character i'd want to write for one of
2963160	2968120	those things you would probably come up with a better one then i would i would of course i would
2968120	2978120	yeah i i i got excited about a vert like like erin told me about a thing where you pay and then
2978120	2983080	it's like a what like a halloween horror thing where you pay and then you go and it's it's it's
2983080	2991160	like a tour god what am i doing i i i i don't know how to talk i you like you you i thought
2991160	2995560	adderall was supposed to help you focus well i took i took that that thing minutes ago it's for
2995560	3002520	it's for minecrafting all night it'll it'll kick in halfway through an episode of em why not be a
3002520	3007880	professional and take this four hours before the show i forgot because i'm not focused on anything
3009800	3018680	the um the i forgot my alzheimer's medication um okay the uh um you go to a thing and like
3018680	3023800	you're uh it's like a one of the it's like a haunted house but like you're um it's like
3023800	3029400	a zombie apocalypse but you're like led through this thing by like these swat team guys who are
3029400	3033480	like survivors they go like come on get through get through the door come on it's closing and
3033480	3038280	you're like you know in a bomb shelter kind of situation and you like run from point to point
3038280	3042440	with like these guys that are like have guns and stuff and they're but they're like performers but
3042440	3046120	there's then there's zombies attacking i was like that that is the only thing i've ever heard of
3046120	3052200	that sounded kind of fun like that i would enjoy doing except for the running but but like like
3052200	3056120	just the idea that there's just like kind of like if you combine that with like a murder mystery
3056120	3063560	thing where like you you're like oh i'm professor uh johnson and i i i i i i need to i need to mow
3063560	3070200	the lawn like if there was a little bit of role playing to it maybe and you kind of did it with
3070200	3075960	your friends so you you you give them a thousand dollars and like you take 80 your friends you go in
3075960	3081080	and then they there's these swat team guys that go come on like like like like okay okay so you
3081080	3084840	get you get you get dropped off in a shuttle are you pushing or should we are we creating a new
3084840	3088920	show right now well yeah and i don't know how much of this that they do but when i heard the idea i
3088920	3092360	got excited about because this is why i pictured like you get in a shuttle and then you get dropped
3092360	3095640	off with like a little like a little beach or something and then like you there's like a
3095640	3099880	like a pretenses like downbeat thing that's going on it's like happy birthday jeff and you're like
3099880	3105480	on a beach and you're like you know like happy birthday jeff and then there's like like a zombie
3105480	3109880	attack that's just sort of staged like like there's like there's a guy who's in your party
3109880	3114200	that you know he's like a red shirt and star trek like he's on the bus with you and he's like
3114200	3120680	uh and y'all know me i'm gale and everyone's like gale you fuck face and and and then like gale
3120680	3126760	wanders off and like he gets he gets attacked horribly by a zombie like and then we go oh
3126760	3131000	shit and i'm like cops or soldiers come up and go come on come on come on come on and they're
3131000	3136280	like go then you like take you to a shelter and then i don't know then you do then you have to
3136280	3141480	like vote on who to feed the zombies or something or this is very similar to my experience yeah
3141480	3146440	so okay so yeah i forgot i forgot were you listening genetically high no no no just like fun
3146440	3150760	fun high you get so you get so you get to this you get to this room and then they go like oh
3150760	3155000	you gotta solve a puzzle yeah and there's like a door in the corner and they expect you to are
3155000	3159640	the easy puzzles are hard yeah is it like is it like the room challenge where it's like uh oh
3159640	3163800	there's a doormat and there's actually there's like a key tape to the bottom of a drawer and
3163800	3169880	yeah so it actually is just this physical kind of perceptiveness yeah it's like the physical
3169880	3175240	it's a real live version of a point and click like thing where you just like run your cursor
3175240	3182120	over everything just like run drag your hand across the room until a shingle turns around
3182120	3187160	those games so i was like the smartest person in my group that i'm like there's a box on the top
3187160	3191960	of the dresser that has a key in it and it's got like like we have to reset the clock and yeah and
3191960	3200440	then the clock makes another key come out stupid exactly all right jenny is jenny jenny yeah sparkle
3200440	3211160	pants jenny sparkle pants high on mushrooms all the time has a major drug problem sparkle pants
3213080	3219640	needs an intervention okay jenny i went to a show with what that dino told me to go to in new
3219640	3224920	york called sleep no more have you guys been to that yeah that that's mcbeth you go into a big
3224920	3228680	hotel and it's a 20s jazz club and you walk in and you get split up from your people and you
3228680	3232680	put a mask on and you walk through rooms and you're encouraged to go snoop through drawers and like
3232680	3237720	like look around and read stuff and and i for the first 45 minutes nothing was going on i was like
3237720	3242200	this sucks and then you would hear some commotion and you start like snooping around and following
3242200	3246200	stuff and then you start watching hamlet be played out but also it's just like you're just
3246200	3250600	in rooms and you watch a murder then everyone gets naked and they're just dancing around it's great
3251480	3261080	yeah everywhere you go that happens it's like a mcdonald's that's not gonna happen to any of us
3261080	3270680	well not with that attitude so erin is at home right now uh because the nigel the grief dog the
3270680	3279400	new dog he ate a pile of harvey's hair and so first i pause why is there a pile of harvey's
3279400	3283400	hair because it's summertime we're starting to give him little haircuts erin gave him a little
3283400	3290360	haircut so there's a pile of shaved hair from harvey dogs eat hair oh yeah grief dogs
3290680	3297800	grief dogs so nigel ate harvey's hair and then he his poops have like like ropes coming out of him
3298360	3300040	and and erin has to pull him
3304440	3307000	like he's a like he's a british christmas popper
3310440	3313000	but there's no you don't get a whistle you don't get anything
3313000	3321560	my i had a dog one time that ate uh the like a um an insole of a shoe like a foam shoe liner
3321560	3327320	insole and it came out like a perfectly spiraled poop shaped it just went straight through this
3327320	3333560	dog's body and came out as a shoe liner it was amazing i'm i'm wearing it right now
3335960	3341800	you gotta figure the dogs that that are among us like they're the descendants of the dogs that
3341800	3348920	mutated the ability to just eat anything and not die almost except harvey had an incident with
3348920	3355880	a fan's uh race crispy treat tray i told you guys about that but but yeah so they they yeah they
3355880	3362280	can so nigel the grief dog is pooping hair ropes right now yeah and erin has to physically pull
3362280	3369080	them out of his butt because it hurts his little took us to it hurts him to make the poops and he's
3369080	3374360	and he's in the middle of getting trained how to poop so he's like this is what i'm supposed to do
3374920	3379880	you care where i do this it hurts and we're like yeah don't do that in the wrong place and he's
3379880	3389560	like it hurts it's all the wrong place i've never heard of a dog eating hair that's a hungry dog
3391480	3394120	but you're not supposed to feed him for the first seven months oh
3394600	3401240	okay now there's your problem yeah there's your problem although i did get my dog training book
3401240	3407160	on ebay and there's a page missing called don't it's called by the way you're supposed to feed
3407160	3412120	your dog yeah it's like the way the words break down it's like i it made it was the equivalent
3412120	3415560	of the six that turns into a nine i haven't fed my dog in seven months
3424280	3433160	fired corner i'm all done with that fucking show and uh are you happy i don't even know
3433160	3437080	i don't even know is it a weight off your shoulders or how do you feel weight if that's
3437880	3441560	like the understatement of the year you seem like you're uh you're just kind of neutrally
3441560	3447960	buoyant i have no idea who i am what i'm doing i have no idea what i like i don't know who likes
3447960	3453480	me i don't know if chris mckenna hates me or if he loves me i have no idea i i'm not joking i
3453480	3459000	sense that because and i'm not saying this to be like you know like corny but like i feel like
3459000	3463400	your identity is often what you're working on and that goes for lots of us and everybody
3463400	3467560	like when you're working on something that is a huge part of who you are yeah and now that that
3467560	3474040	show is over do you feel like there's a like a suspension of like identity yes it's called
3474040	3482920	workaholism which sounds productive but like it can also just be this just like a slob who like
3482920	3487320	only knows who he is like yeah like by what he does does that make you want to throw yourself
3487320	3491000	into rick and morty or whatever's next or does it make you want to just play minecraft or i'd
3491000	3499160	like to play minecraft for a little while and uh you know which is me working digitally you know
3499160	3503480	so i know who i am by my marble cube you don't you don't have a picture yourself like like

3677560	3682120	fucking burger and it's like there's somewhere there's this assembly line of these sad animals
3682120	3686440	that have like iq higher than some of the people i work with we're out of fucking water here in
3686440	3690280	california if you fly in a plane in the daytime you're landing california look out the window
3690280	3695560	and look at all the reservoirs empty there's no fucking water here and yet we have tons of water
3695560	3700920	to grow alfalfa which is what we feed cows and it takes like a fucking ton of acres of alfalfa to
3700920	3705480	make a couple pounds of meat it's ridiculous like it's completely insane and then they fart and the
3705480	3710120	cows fart and that's an environmental thing the cow farts did you know that that's just a that's
3710120	3718680	just a fucking bugbear man so i can tell you it's a it's a bogey what it's it's a muck a muck
3720680	3730760	it's a muffle mash there you've been muffle mashed man but i i hear tell that the the the
3730760	3740440	beef is like a big proud you know deforestation it's 9 11 nice it's 9 11 it's 9 11 make a wish
3740440	3747960	all right what do we do now our new tradition is every week you forget like but we never really
3747960	3755480	have we said 11 i think for this week we make a one-act play about 9 11 okay or no we make a
3755480	3759640	one-act play about whatever we were just talking about well it's uh we do a one-act play about
3759640	3765800	set against the backdrop of 9 11 okay but it's about something else okay but about genes
3766600	3772040	about no don't that's don't go there okay there's an urban legend about firefighters stealing
3772040	3778920	genes during 9 11 it's not true stealing genes from where from the from the concourse underneath
3778920	3784200	9 11 there was like yeah it's an urban legend is that there's this guy that wrote a book about
3784280	3788520	ground zero and like like there was this there was this urban legend that developed
3788520	3796280	where they found a fire truck filled with genes from the gap and it's the most ridiculous urban
3796280	3800920	legend because it's like can you imagine being a firefighter during 9 11 and you're like boys
3801960	3810760	you're looking at this the wrong way it's just so silly it's just for every for everything that
3810760	3814600	we hold sacred someone has to like create some kind of thing it's just like we have a our mind
3814600	3819480	creates mythology so there was like there was like this there was this there was this notion
3819480	3823880	it's completely unverifiable that they they unearthed in the rubble a fire truck and it
3823880	3833320	was filled with genes and for the and i hope i i don't i i can feel it's clear in the room but for
3833320	3838040	in case it doesn't translate over electronic fibers like we're laughing at the we're laughing
3838040	3843080	because 9 11 is bad and people are good and firefighters are great and like we're
3843080	3848520	we're not laughing like at 9 11 but our firefighters firefighters great only because of their weird
3848520	3853960	love of genes that's what i mean it is like it's funny it just gets you like we're in the rick and
3853960	3857720	morty's writers room we were talking about this for three hours about the firefighters stealing
3857720	3864520	the geez and we we developed a whole movie about about a firefighter what was it what was the movie
3864520	3868840	called can we can we fade in can you can we see some of that movie the movie i know the slogan
3868840	3881080	for the movie was one size fits all it's all right so like but no i no i want to i want to
3881080	3886840	talk about it logistically the the because the the poster i also remember the poster i drew
3887800	3894280	was the new york skyline with with two legs legs of genes that became
3898040	3902440	oh oh oh and the title i remember the title became what became what i don't know what you're
3902440	3908920	talking about there's this the the the the the the the the the story is about a firefighter who
3909000	3917720	survives 9 11 with a bunch of genes and and he now goes around the country and he gives a pair of
3917720	3925880	pants to each family of of a victim of 9 11 and and they magically all fit like like like oh there's
3925880	3931160	like a silly good traveling pants like like thing in there but and the the title of the movie was
3931160	3936120	read no just i gotta get this right so re denim shin
3941080	3945480	we developed the whole movie we did not work on rick and warty for a half a day
3946520	3949800	and we were and we were just crying laughing of course we're crying laughing because it's
3949800	3954760	trash you know the it's that's that's why these how does a firefighter acquire all of his genes
3954760	3959320	but how did he come across the idea is that there's a concourse underneath the world trade
3959320	3963320	center that has all these stores and stuff and there was like they they were looting before they
3963320	3969080	really realized the gravity that it was just it's just it's not true it's not a real story it was it
3969080	3974600	was printed in a book by a guy who did not verify the story he just kept hearing it but every time
3974600	3978920	every person you heard it from was not a verifiable you know there's this urban legend so he printed
3978920	3985320	over urban legend so it became like a real urban legend it's like you know you google like or yahoo
3985320	3995480	uh uh fire firefighter paint 9 11 nice catch nice catch it really is a good search engine
3997400	4001000	it's much more than it's so much more than searching you could you could without even

4048360	4055320	uh yeah redenemption so when the people get the pants and they magically fit then they're like
4055320	4062040	okay thank you but fucked up what you did and he's like i couldn't have and they're like we know
4062600	4066840	like but still but then she should have tried and he's like okay shouldn't that guy go i gave away
4066840	4072920	all the pants i did what i could i like everyone got pants that was affected by this they all fit
4072920	4077080	and he goes back home to long island there's family we're standing down let's say and he goes
4077080	4085640	back home his wife and kids and he sits there and i knock on the door and it's an old that was by
4085640	4092760	accident or was it uh there's a knock on the door and there's an old like like i'm picturing
4093720	4097080	the asian guy from gremlins the guy that's that gives him the magway
4099640	4104440	you know that there's a uh those jeans uh there's a reason why they were hidden down there in that
4104440	4112040	concourse beneath the world trade center tower tower one because those jeans are cursed oh no
4112040	4115640	and no this is going to be and then you pull back and there's there's towers being built
4116840	4118600	everywhere where he gave pants away
4124040	4125640	yeah and then that music plays
4128280	4132120	what did you what are you shaking your head for what did you expect i wanted you to launch into
4132120	4137720	one of your famous fade-ins on fucking you know like like that's a that's the end of the movie
4137800	4139400	no it's the beginning of the second act
4142120	4147880	what it's the beginning the first act is 9 11 happens and a firefighter gives away all the pants
4147880	4153880	yes and at the end of the first act a chinese guy says those pants cause 9 11 that's the crossing
4153880	4161320	of the first threshold are you Christopher Nolan yes the first threshold is there oh seems like a
4161320	4165640	good movie that that seems like that was enough however no no you got yourself into a world of
4165640	4171240	fucking this is this is way bigger than jeans it's way bigger than 9 11 three hours of mcconaughey
4171240	4178200	and a book shelf uh no you gave you gave everybody cursed pants all right all right pants
4181320	4183960	i've not seen the movie you're talking about you gotta see this movie
4185640	4194120	oh behind the bookcase oh there's me oh that's when i did that oh
4194120	4199880	oh i'm a little bolder now because since i since i aired that my grievances about
4199880	4203640	interstellar i have a lot of people have come forward and thanked me for my bravery
4205000	4212200	and said thank you i can't i can't say it you know i'm a i'm a p.a or a stunt coordinator
4212200	4219000	you know someone has to fall off that bookcase like nolan runs this town thank you thank you
4219000	4226920	for saying that the movie's a little silly anyways your movie my movie is that the movie
4226920	4231080	starts when the when the guy finds out that the pants he gave away he thought he was doing a good
4231080	4236040	deed so at what point in your movie is the guy going from town to town giving pants and having
4236040	4241320	these emotional conversations like i would call that a road of trials right okay for you it's just
4241320	4247720	like a ordinary world let's make it let's make it the uh the the the uh the meeting with the
4247720	4253400	goddess is the is the chinese guy saying finding the pants uh is the top of the circle the bottom
4253400	4256280	of the circle is like oh finding out what the pants are actually when you say finding the pants
4256280	4262040	you mean looting them from 9 11 right all right so it fades in on 9 11 yeah a guy a guy says oh
4262040	4267960	shit free pants 9 11 fucking great then his wife goes honey that's fucking you you you profited you
4268680	4273800	we have a fire fire truck full of jeans outside are we identifying with this character so like it
4273800	4278040	fades in and 9 11's happening yes and then it catches you like a certain battalion and the
4278040	4283640	guy's goes like go go go go uh up to floor 19 up the floor 19 and the guy's like this is just
4283640	4287480	a fire it's gonna be or there's an accident like the sign like you got if you really want to
4287480	4291880	identify with the guy like the sign has to turn upside down so he goes to the wrong floor sure
4291880	4295320	so then he's just surrounded with pants there's jeans and maybe maybe someone else says hey you
4295400	4298200	know everybody clear out the building it's like this it's just a fire let's get everybody out
4298200	4301640	there and he goes i got all these fucking jeans in there right take these jeans and then so he
4301640	4304760	goes home he's got a bunch of jeans but he gets home and he goes i gotta get these jeans out of
4304760	4309560	here and then he realizes all of his friends are dead and is and he feels guilty about it so he
4309560	4313160	goes and gives all those jeans away he's i'm gonna make my mission to travel the earth so it's like a
4313160	4319480	cold 9 11 is the cold open right and it's like like yeah he so he runs into and he's like like
4319480	4323560	like i think you need like you'd have to do it in flashback which is kind of cheating but you have
4323560	4328360	to establish that this guy like like you're you know turk 182 yeah like the idea that being a
4328360	4334440	firefighter is like the city fucks you over you know like like like you're you like the guy is
4334440	4341240	like his dad is like is uh has dementia or his brother well just just rip off turk 182 i'd say
4341240	4346520	his brother got hurt really bad being a firefighter and they didn't give him compensation so like like
4346520	4353160	like he's he's going to 9 11 like like half you know pre predisposed primed he's like he's like
4353160	4356520	this is my last day as a firefighter and then they're like and then they're they're like
4356520	4362440	mismanaging 9 11 somehow still in a civic sense they're like go up holding powder roger that
4363560	4366840	you kind of look at the bureaucratic side of it you're like disillusioned you're like it's a
4366840	4371880	disaster and i know i know the big picture of this and but from his perspective it's like this
4371880	4375240	is ridiculous like what is my job how do i know when i'm helping people or whatever and then he
4375320	4380440	just like goes to this door like because he's like i'm gonna i'm gonna try and they're like
4380440	4385480	he gets yelled at he's like like his boss goes like henderson what are you doing he's like i'm
4385480	4392520	trying to save people sir he's like i don't pay you to save people go in that room and and cool
4392520	4401400	off go in that room until you know what's important and he goes in the room and it's like a closed
4401400	4408120	down gap and he's like and he looks up and it's like denim gold yeah and then the fluorescent
4408120	4413400	lights are flickering and it's like there's just jeans everywhere yeah and and it's like the camera
4413400	4423880	kind of pushes on him as you hear like black red denim and then and then it fades up and it's like
4423880	4429480	like his his like dementia addled father is like being fed soup by his mom when they're watching
4429480	4434040	like all the coverage of the disaster like a week later and his brother's like all burnt up in the
4434040	4438280	corner going like i when i a good thing i didn't have to go to night 11 he's like yeah but you get
4438280	4442440	fucked up too and they fucked you over and then and he's like and they're like how come you how
4442440	4446280	come you survived night 11 he's like i told you they made me go in a room and and they're like
4446280	4449880	well whatever and and then he's like okay i'm gonna go downstairs and think about stuff and
4449880	4455160	he goes down to his bedroom and like his bed is surrounded by all these jeans and he's watching on
4455160	4462120	the tv he's watching these funerals like the 21 gun salutes and the and then and then he's like
4462120	4467640	he's just laying in his bed he's like fuck the fuck have i done i'm a ghoul i'm a horrible ghoul
4468200	4471800	and so then like okay so this is like seven minutes into the movie
4473640	4478520	the credits are still going underneath as he like dry and then it's like cuts to montana director
4478520	4483800	of photography and he goes like i'm so sorry ma'am here's your pain like i i fucked up i was there
4484440	4488600	i i couldn't have done anything but i did steal these pants and it's fucked up it doesn't make
4488600	4493800	any sense it's like that's why that's why karmically why this shit happens to us as a country is
4493800	4499720	because of greed so here's these pants back and and and i hope they fit you and and and she's
4499720	4507240	like i'll be right back i don't know if they will but i'm like they better obviously and and then
4507240	4511560	she and then she actually they should look like they they really won't they should look way too
4511560	4515400	small for us it won't thank you like i obviously is like great you know what i'm gonna go try to
4515400	4519800	put these on and and come out and bitch you out yeah so she goes in the bedroom and then it's
4519800	4524680	like this is just a clock ticking tick as he looks at the photographs of the dead 9 11 people
4524680	4531560	and the flag folded up yeah and there's the dog's like and and then she and then he's like he's
4531560	4535240	like i'm i'm gonna do i'm just gonna maybe you add like a character that's always like you should
4535240	4540600	kill yourself like like like like like the ghost of uh his brother died in 9 11 so he's so that
4540680	4544440	he always there's always like a voice his brother saying do it do it fucking kill yourself you piece
4544440	4549480	of shit you should have fucking died you should be dead and he's like okay you want me to do it you
4549480	4556040	want me to do it and he takes a corkscrew and he's like got it under his under his neck and and and
4556040	4562280	and then the woman says yes i do want you to do it and and he slowly turns and she's like i do
4562280	4568680	want you to keep giving out these pants because because they fit great i was about to ask you do
4568760	4572600	i look fat in these jeans but i know what the answer is the answer is no right i look fantastic
4572600	4577240	and he's like oh and she's like you're doing a good thing here i suggest keep doing it and then
4577240	4583400	he goes take me home country road it's like a line going around the country and there's just pants
4583400	4589720	like it's just a you know you got to speed this up at a certain point it's just like stacks of pants
4589720	4595880	going down and like like like people accepting them talking to him like cowboys in a pasture
4595880	4600680	of cows and they take the hand there's a seaside one kid has neither kid has jeans on and then
4600680	4604440	custom one kid and all of a sudden that kid has jeans on and then they get it
4609960	4616200	you're doing camera tricks like like like like it cuts like a Beatles video like they're
4618920	4622600	i'm trying to make this fun it's me it's tasteless it's terrible
4623480	4630360	it's just like it's supposed to you're making it seem like campy and like like like fun like
4630360	4632120	okay i'll take it more seriously though
4634680	4640040	i'm sorry is okay keeps giving pets i'm trying to i'm trying to write your movie like okay
4640040	4645560	because okay so it's page page 13 the truck and you look at the truck and there's like you see
4645560	4649160	the stack of jeans getting slowly smaller the last pair of jeans and he gives it to somebody
4649160	4653160	and that that last person should be somebody who like somebody somebody it's the it's the
4653160	4657800	14 year old black kid that becomes like his sidekick because the pants don't fit for some reason
4661160	4666120	because he lives in the Bronx and the last stop is like he's like he's like hey kid but the real
4666120	4670520	reason is because the kid will find out on page 60 he lied he doesn't he's not a family of a
4670520	4677240	survivor he just wanted pants okay okay i know i know it's funny but it's gonna be a
4678040	4682840	but his brother got shot by cops now and he deserves the fucking pants because everyone
4682840	4689560	has 9 11 going on all the time it's it's only now after you say that that i feel bad about my camera
4689560	4694760	tricks and the seesaw yeah like like you're trying to win an Oscar and you're like doing like like

4704920	4711000	fit and the guy says what our hero says he says like huh maybe because it's the last pair uh and
4711000	4714840	then the kid's like yeah i don't know but they're like kind of baggy and he's like maybe i like
4714840	4719000	maybe those jeans were in the in the fire truck already maybe those maybe they're my pants i don't

4751640	4756600	a knock on the door it's an old chinese man says like those pants were under 9 11 for a reason
4757400	4767960	they're cursed they caused 9 11 this is your idea no okay oh well okay well i i they're cursed
4767960	4771800	was your idea right i'm saying that there's a reason like like you find out that he puts
4771800	4777480	these pants on people but that uh that comes in like that's just too good to be true there's
4777480	4781400	a reason why they fit everybody yeah he has to go get them all back no
4781400	4791480	i think all those people like like they he's created an army of people with magic jeans on
4794360	4801480	that they're worse than 9 11 so what happens you're the writer
4804440	4809240	i wrote a whole movie about the guy and you were like i thought your momentum would carry you through
4809240	4816040	this oh man no they become zombies yeah i was thinking well yeah it just seems like it's just
4816040	4822920	a random this is like mumblecore is that what they call it mumblecore yeah it's like one of
4822920	4828840	those dupeless dupeless brothers disappointed dan i thought you would uh been able to finish this
4828840	4834840	off what did the guy said he comes and says those are pants like we're crossing the first threshold
4834840	4838760	those pants those pants are cursed so then he goes like okay i should go get them back and the chinese
4838840	4847240	guy goes no you can't because well that would be back and forthy so so now all those people are
4847240	4853960	gonna they're gonna start fires are they gonna be al-qaeda are they gonna let's say okay forget
4853960	4861800	the curse thing let's say that is what weddings start hitting people's houses yeah what does well
4861800	4866760	planes yeah well what if the gene wearing people like are they're driven now to return to the
4866760	4876360	concourse and if they all do something horrible happens it's really more of a thinker though
4876360	4881560	what about okay dan dan forget about the chinese guy at the door like what's the end of your movie
4881560	4886200	the guy gives the pants back and what happens that that's well the whole movie is yeah he gives
4886200	4890840	well like in my movie that's the end of the movie he gives the pants back the end everybody gives
4890840	4896360	me the threshold is he sets out on the road to go give the pants back so it's a whole quadrant of
4896360	4903320	the circle is 9 11 which is what people want out of this from the poster they're like buying
4903320	4910200	tickets to see this so because the towers are both legs of pants the road trials oh sorry tom
4910200	4915720	koffman from rick and mornie he sent me a picture of the thing and i have i have the log line in the
4915720	4922360	the title it's really close um he put the the tag line is heroes coming all sizes heroes coming
4922440	4931240	all sizes which is also willow yeah i stole it from willow but and then uh it's it's redenimshin
4931960	4936280	colon pants on fire because he's a liar yeah
4939400	4944200	yeah all right yeah the the pants don't have to be cursed that's just good enough alone
4944200	4949320	so so it's a it's a it's not a movie it's not it's not like an event film it's like a a tear
4949320	4954280	jerker and an oscar winner like he he goes on a journey of self-discovery like he figures out who
4954280	4958760	he is why did he take those pants what the fuck is wrong with him so what does he find out at the
4958760	4963720	end what does he learn the whole system's fucked and you know like fucking rich people should die
4965880	4973400	but anybody that makes more than me like like like billionaires they should they should have
4973400	4977720	all their money redistributed that's what he finds out but then there's nothing about it that's the
4977720	4983960	end of the film well i just that's a lot to take in he's probably need a voiceover
4985480	4989720	but you got you got all these magic no he gives all the pants you don't deal with the magic pants
4989720	4993960	why are they magical right they're not they think they think you whether they because the the
4993960	4998360	traveling pants of the sisterhood they wasn't it wasn't it wasn't like they didn't stop the movie
4998360	5006280	and go holy fuck the devil is real like they it was it was just the idea that these girls
5006280	5011400	like were bonded in a way like every time they put on the pants i assume that they fit he's giving
5011400	5014920	his pants away to strangers that aren't characters in the movie he's just giving is a montage and
5014920	5021800	they all fit because he okay so they all fit when his when his like apology is real okay okay okay
5021800	5029960	all right i got it so the goddess is like a hot woman and her husband died at 9 11 and he chokes
5029960	5035240	up on the bat like he changes a couple things and the pants don't fit because he hasn't come clean
5035240	5041960	he's like it's like uh quantum leap rules he's got a he's got to come 100% clean with the people
5041960	5049400	he gives the pants to or they don't fit and she's like hot so he's like tempted he doesn't want to
5049400	5056760	be a piece of shit and like because he wants to date her so he he kind of he changes a couple
5056760	5063400	details about his pants looting and and his steak in 9 11 and stuff and she's like oh you're so
5063400	5067320	you're kind of a hero and he's like yeah and then she's like okay well let's go on that date
5067320	5073240	and i'm gonna wear my new pants to the date and he's like cool i'm gonna i'm gonna get so laid
5073240	5080920	and it's good and then she's like they don't fit and and that that's like and and then and
5080920	5084920	he's like well here's another pair and she's like these don't fit either what the fuck's going on
5085720	5092200	i don't know why she'd be so it's like it's like groundhog day he has to learn how to be honest
5092200	5096520	like he has to get it right and find out how to make the pants fit on this hot chick
5097800	5104440	i think they all become zombies all right well let's develop it later we should only spend like
5104440	5109640	a maximum of 20 minutes developing the 9 11 i don't care if it takes all fucking night we're
5109640	5113800	gonna fucking hash this out you know you let it go you gotta step back and then you work on other
5113800	5122200	projects right right let's bring to morge out in preparation
5122200	5128600	go
5128600	5149000	yeah

5626040	5633400	dig deep and uh as we play shadow run uh spencer do we have a guest uh intro yeah i think it's by
5633400	5638280	let's be safe but again all right i just a lot of people have been sending not a lot people have
5638280	5643560	been sending me in a lot of the ones i haven't read were too long if anyone's curious wants to
5643560	5649160	revise their work what what what's a good range for length i don't know it's just i mean if you
5649160	5653240	write it read it out loud and see how long it takes yeah i would say 45 seconds is probably
5653240	5659720	a good thing right yeah i mean we run a tight ship over here we really do if our show has proven
5659720	5666760	anything get your shit together well i kind of do right i gotta keep a tight ship you do no it's
5667160	5674520	well you you should yeah i do you you're allowed to thank you so you're saying to those would be uh
5675240	5681720	intro shadow run people writers keep it around under a minute yeah no no offense it's good
5681720	5691640	stuff it's all good stuff that's to our video listeners all right spencer take it away all right
5696760	5704760	last time on harmontown shadow town after completing their first mission the gang kicked
5704760	5711160	back for some much-needed r and r lounging around the pool table at their usual watering hole hank's
5711160	5716680	last stand they indulged in their favorite vices their moment of peace was shattered when an old
5716680	5724040	extremely italian man named ryan dervish barged in screaming jittery and jumping after calming
5724120	5729640	down he explained that the notorious spagouli crime family has kidnapped his son jelly
5729640	5734920	won over by his offer of 2 000 new year in a piece and a pair of fancy italian shoes
5734920	5741640	our heroes accepted the mission to retrieve jelly dervish the old man intimated that arturo spagouli
5741640	5747960	a big stupid dick might know something about the kidnapping the gang resolved to confront
5747960	5754680	arturo at his favorite eatery the burger tyrant but will they find stupid arturo the big dick
5754680	5760920	will they use their well-honed skills and famous teamwork to extract information will they retrieve
5760920	5769080	jelly dervish with their usual discretion and grace find out on harmontown shadow time thank you
5769080	5781880	okay so we're on our we're on our way to a restaurant to uh to uh we're going to the burger
5781880	5789560	tyrants yeah you're headed towards the boob uh the burger the boober tyrant what what kind of
5789560	5795000	vehicle are we in right now you're in an uber we're in an uber what what's our hey driver what's your
5795000	5801960	name it's a robot robot what's your is the robot program to sexually harass women or does that
5801960	5807800	slowly drop away as the uber interested and is the robot is the robot program to after you get
5807800	5811880	out of the car to keep the meter running and pretend that you that the ride is cancelled but
5811880	5818760	charge you for a ride that you didn't do and oh shit gauntlet down all of those yeah we never use
5818840	5824600	lift we just i use lift all the fucking time i get it great uber can driving you happy suck a dick
5824600	5830440	that's what they say hey uh hey uh robot uh how far away from my burger tyrant oh we're pretty
5830440	5837560	close you guys should uh have just enough time to formulate a plan night blade what you got
5838520	5841400	uh not the planning type as such but uh
5841400	5849240	uh i just want to get straight in my head uh this guy uh he's the one who might know where jelly
5849240	5857480	is our tourist pergoli he's a big dick all right uh so we should probably lure him out uh figure
5857480	5862360	out a way to get him by himself i got a feeling he'll be probably surrounded by a lot of a lot
5862360	5868280	of guys hey um hortiguard can you find out what kind of car our tourist pergoli drives is it
5868280	5879080	possible that i could uh possibly uh re-contact my friend rich buson uh yeah ritz ritz hey how are
5879080	5891160	you it's ritz yes don't uh be aggressive with me oh this is just my voice um there is uh we obviously
5891160	5897320	were looking for this uh this asshole this sort of dick the person yeah um is it possible that
5897320	5902440	we could lead let rule him is there something that would bring him out perhaps uh since he's
5902440	5908520	been drinking a glass of water or uh is there some other sort of totem that we might bring him outside
5908520	5914360	with to get him outside of his protection hmm that's a good question i don't really know the
5914360	5919640	guy personally i just i put some i put some you know some of my ears out and found out that's
5919640	5925800	where he is you might you might have better luck asking around elsewhere you see you still talking
5926120	5931960	this guy is it possible that i could use another identity and perhaps go in and lure him out my
5931960	5938120	shelf it's certainly possible is it also possible that we could use our uh our uh our fabulous face
5938680	5942440	the one to the right of me although you're not looking at me right now but the one to the right
5942440	5948280	of me i say we we send in the fabulous i say we use mercy o'Donnell as much as possible on this
5948280	5958920	mission i think this is mercy's time to shine yeah i knew i was gonna make it mercy uh driver
5958920	5966360	are we here at the burger tyrants uh we're just pulling up to three blocks away rich billson rich
5966360	5972680	billson there are a few times that i will say this i apologize for uh abusing your time i will
5972680	5977640	make this up to you later we have a plan uh we've come up with it on our own uh good day sir thanks
5977640	5983640	man let's do uh let's do a blue beauty with a honey pot on the front end do you think that's
5983640	5991160	a good idea it seems to be the configuration okay most conducive in the situation i'll be the honey
5991160	6000040	pot no wait oh if i could uh perhaps the honeypot could be somebody else is that possible do we know
6000040	6006600	his sexual proclivities do we know you know you have a face that is irresistible regardless of
6006600	6015720	sexual proclivities it deals in the i can't tell you guys guys look i huddle everybody up i said
6015720	6019640	look i i think that we'll be fooling ourselves if we didn't think the best plan is to send mercy
6019640	6026280	o' donnell just right in the front door as the as the honey pot and then okay your job is to get
6026280	6035320	him get him over to uh our pre-arranged location uh which is which is just out back of the burger
6035320	6041720	tyrant okay so we're at the front of the burger tyrant you're uh three blocks away we're three
6041720	6046440	blocks away still could the over driver perhaps pull up to the back of the well if we get too
6046440	6052440	close they're gonna they're gonna send something's up okay let's stop let's stop should we stop a
6052440	6059800	block away night blade and let mercy o' donnell walk in the front can i get my beyonce stride on
6060280	6068920	i think you go in we do we do one of these you go in and then uh like uh we stage a uh
6068920	6075560	she has a falling out with her uh her boy and then wait i'm trying to figure out how to like
6075560	6080840	why don't you be the boy she'll uh and then she's gonna get him out to the car if the simple version
6080840	6085320	is she just gets him out to the car and then we're all in the car the more complex version
6085320	6090280	is to get him even further away why can't i just try and convince him to come with me into the car
6090280	6095480	i think we just let her do her thing okay all right perhaps we let this happen yeah and let her get
6095480	6099880	him outside of the building and then we work from there well we're all listed we'll all be in the
6099880	6104680	car you just get him out into the car yeah all right yeah we are relatively speaking night
6104680	6113480	blade is on focus at this time so yeah yeah another hour of unfocused all right so are we
6113480	6119080	a block away yes spencer yep all right mercy yeah i trust you implicitly you really should
6120840	6128280	i got this go knock him dead i have exceptional charisma and uh negotiation top notch
6129080	6132760	is it is it possible i could be both a physical and emotional spotter
6134760	6140280	i think maybe not hovering in the background but perhaps just staying close by in case
6140280	6144440	things go awry yeah it could go off the rails it may very well
6147160	6154600	so what's the move gentlemen and lady it's it's mercy time it's fucking mercy time all right
6154600	6160200	mercy go in there and work your charm so get get what else is go meet our tourist bagulli
6160200	6165480	walk and try to find out and get him out to the car with us okay so right now it's just me
6166280	6169080	walking in all along you must whip it
6171320	6179480	okay so i get to the burger tyrant walk in what's what's the surrounding all right so uh
6179480	6184600	the burger tyrant is classic garbage food of the sixth world 3d printers squirting out grease and
6184600	6190680	krill protein into recognizable shapes injected with flavor simulates and microwaved for perfection
6190680	6195480	to perfection burger tyrant is the pinnacle of the technology serving millions of day this
6195480	6200280	location looks pretty new so it must have been rebuilt to the tyrant's new security slash hygiene
6200280	6206040	specifications standing tall in front of the front door is a hologram icon of the burger
6206040	6212760	tyrant himself his arms are open wide and he proclaims all are welcome get your burgers done
6212760	6220200	right but please oh please don't go and fight leave your weapons at home leave your weapons at home
6220840	6222040	leave your weapons at home

6240680	6246200	you're your ghost okay could be dangerous you go first try not to ghost block
6246440	6254360	so you step into the you step into the burger tyrant it's it's a filthy joint it looks like
6254360	6260120	it must be one of those uh franchise locations rather than a corp run place specifically because
6260120	6265160	the security detail is woefully substandard there's usually about five armed guards on
6265160	6270680	duty at your average burger tyrant here you only see one he's wearing a bulletproof vest and he's
6270680	6277560	picking his nose the second you walk into the door however you hear a piercing shrill alarm
6277560	6284600	shriek lights start flashing and going off right as you right as you uh enter the door and three
6284600	6292360	fry cooks and uh the security guard all pull guns and level pistols right at you they say no weapons
6292360	6298920	get out of here or we're shooting you to death hey hey calm down no weapons it's hey hold on
6298920	6306200	it's law hold on just a second let's just let's just step it back no weapons hold on
