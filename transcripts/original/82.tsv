0	13680	Hello from Meltdown Comics, from the Nerd Milk Theater in Hollywood, California.
13680	15920	Parment Town is now in session.
15920	20880	Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Parment Town.
20880	21880	Dan Harmon!
21880	34920	Happy Thanksgiving, thank you for making the drive and the treacherous traffic.
34920	37800	Good for you, good for you folks.
37800	40440	So there was some kind of parade or something in L.A., right?
40440	41440	Uh, something...
41440	43040	Was it the Christmas parade?
43040	44040	Yes.
44040	45040	Yeah.
45040	46040	Really?
46040	47040	That's a big parade.
47040	49040	It's a bummer though, have you been to it?
49040	50960	Uh, no, no.
50960	51960	It's not a good parade.
51960	52960	I assume it's...
52960	55960	No parade is a good parade.
55960	59200	Now, anyway, I saw the Macy's Day one on TV.
59200	63760	Yeah, Ronald McDonald was just scraping his belly along the...
63760	64760	Broadway.
64760	69200	I don't know if there was a golden age of the Macy's Day parade when it was like, oh,
69200	73800	each float is a cultural masterpiece or something, and it just happens in Hong Kong, Phooey's
73800	79520	in there too, but I think it was probably always a commercial jerk-off, like, it was
79520	84280	probably all, you know, it's probably all pretty capitalistic in nature, but boy, how
84280	85280	would he...
85280	89000	With the floats and then they just stop, and this is like this weird, silent boulevard
89000	94800	and some kid in a snow jacket does a breakdance, and the announcers are just going like, there's
94800	99360	the buttermilk cracker float, buttermilk crackers, that's Santa's workshop, the crackers
99360	104840	go down the chimney, and out to all the boys and girls, and there's Alonzo Mosley.
104840	108920	The star of...
108920	117480	The character from Midnight Run that Yapit Kodo played, in point of fact, is who I just
117480	118480	named.
118480	120360	That's where my brain...
120360	122360	Were he and Hong Kong Phooey in the same parade?
122360	126360	Do you want to tell people who Hong Kong Phooey is in case they don't know?
126360	128440	Hey, look, I didn't even know who the hell he was.
128440	132000	I only ever knew who Hong Kong Phooey was from the Macy's parade.
132000	136320	It would be the, you know, it was that hold-on float.
136320	141360	I don't know if there was still a Hong Kong Phooey, but there was a Pokemon, or a Pikachu,
141360	147680	and the last thing, because it was playing in the hotel in Florida, and the last thing
147680	150480	on the feed in Florida was Santa Claus.
150480	155720	I guess that's how they end, a guy goes, and as always, the end of all the Thanksgiving
155720	161840	parades, there's Santa Claus, boy, it's great to see him, and as all the kids get on top
161840	171240	of the parents' straining commercial, that was really funny, this kid that you just left
171240	176960	with the image of kids on top of parents' straining, anyways, whatever, it was close.
176960	178480	Normally, it's the other way around.
178480	185200	Yeah, usually the parents strain on top of the kids, yeah.
185200	190000	It was funny.
190000	199720	In Purvland, yeah, is that Lorraine Newman's husband?
199720	209600	He's like a weird version of Commander Pike from Star Trek, he's got only a couple buttons
209600	219200	on his, all right, I see the writing on the wall, I'm not the most facile tonight, that's
219200	221440	why we should bring up our amazing friends.
221440	224320	I'm under the weather right now, so I'm in another world.
224320	229520	Let's put the onus on the bonus.
229520	234600	Let's showbiz talk for, let's hinge the show on our special guests.
234600	237480	Let's put the onus on the bonus.
237480	242000	It's an old showbiz term.
242000	244360	Let's put the onus on the bonus.
244360	246160	Don't tell me you've never heard that phrase.
246160	252120	I know what the onus is, it's on the bonus, but they don't know who the bonus is.
252120	257160	Well, I tweeted what the bonus was and he did make it.
257160	265120	Please welcome my impish, quixotic, energetic, incredible, genius, intimidating, delightful
265120	272120	friend Mitch Hurwitz to the stage.
272120	285920	Have any seat you like, do whatever you like with them, okay, go ahead, sit off there,
285920	294400	it doesn't matter, yeah, Mitch Hurwitz, all right, there's a mic in there.
294400	297440	That was the thing that your anus was on.
297440	298440	Dan.
298440	307120	First of all, I can tell you, you have never seen an artist prepare the way Dan does backstage.
307120	309120	Can I lift the veil a little bit?
309120	310120	Sure, sure.
310120	314680	He gets here at like four in the afternoon and it's calisthenics and then newspaper
314680	320120	after newspaper, it's unbelievable to see your process.
320120	322480	Yeah, I look for funny ads.
322480	327960	And then the grooming, I mean the grooming, which I'd heard about, you had only heard
327960	328960	about.
328960	333480	Dan wakes up, actually he doesn't wake up, he wakes up at 6 a.m. as you know and gets
333480	338480	straight to work and starts writing community by 7 at Paramount, but at 4.30 while he's
338480	343400	still asleep, a team of Korean women come in and groom him in his sleep.
343400	345160	That's why every year is always...
345160	346160	And punch up.
346160	347160	Yep.
347200	353040	But I really admire, I make this joke as a statement of admiration because your process
353040	354360	is so effortless.
354360	355360	It just comes out of you.
355360	357880	Honestly, my process is really tortured.
357880	359600	Do you want to see me try to think of a joke?
359600	360600	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
360600	362600	Tell me when I want to go to the caterpillar.
362600	363880	Oh, okay.
365880	366880	See what I mean?
366880	369160	It's just not...
369160	370960	It's not like your... it's too much.
370960	372200	Dan, show him your process.
372200	373200	It doesn't podcast.
373200	375200	Hey, guy walks in a bar, rape.
378160	380160	See, I don't...
380160	381160	Yeah.
382160	383160	Make sure everybody...
383160	385160	Thanks for coming, Mitch.
386160	387160	Whatever comes out of my mouth.
387160	388160	Your band is amazing too.
388160	389160	They're so cute.
392160	395160	The band is good.
395160	401600	So speaking of work ethic, I wanted to ask you about your days at Fox working on Arrested
401600	404760	Development, world's smartest company.
404760	406720	Would you like there to be no more Arrested Development?
406720	408720	Or would you just speak candidly?
408720	410720	No, I wouldn't like there to be...
410720	413720	Because that might be the result of me speaking candidly.
413720	414720	What do you mean?
414720	415720	No, no, no.
415720	416720	I think our situations were pretty similar.
416720	417720	Yeah.
417720	418720	I do.
418720	419720	I think I...
419720	425720	I created a more of a, you know, a sort of a polished social exterior than you did, but
425720	428720	I feel like...
428720	430720	But I didn't have to work with Chevy Chase.
430720	431720	Right.
432720	433720	But you did have to work.
433720	436720	I've heard backstage gossips and murmurs.
436720	437720	Yeah.
437720	439720	Your family was no easy...
439720	440720	No.
440720	441720	They weren't like a...
441720	444720	Like, community is blessed with a bunch of people that...
444720	445720	Except for Joel.
445720	446720	I know it.
446720	447720	They're amazing.
447720	448720	Yeah.
448720	449720	Joel is a bit of a bitter pill.
449720	450720	Yeah.
450720	451720	So you have to swallow.
451720	452720	And there's a girl named Gillian.
452720	453720	Did you know that?
453720	454720	Yeah.
454720	455720	She's a...
455720	457720	She will throw a tantrum if you pronounce the G wrong.
457720	458720	Yeah.
458720	459720	I meant her.
459720	464720	There are hardcover books around that she only bought because she heard about him on
464720	465720	NPR.
465720	466720	Yeah.
466720	469720	And she got them because of the hardness of the cover because she wants to throw them
469720	470720	at people.
470720	475720	And that is, let's just say drinking and let's just say gambling and let's just say violence
475720	476720	and let's...
476720	481720	I got to spend a few days over there and they really were amazing.
481720	482720	Yeah.
482720	483720	And they lionize you.
483720	484720	Yeah.
484720	485720	What is that...
485720	488720	What is the word when you compare someone to a lion?
489720	492720	Whatever that is, they do to you.
493720	495720	And they'll be like, oh, here comes Dan.
495720	497720	He can smell their red meat.
498720	499720	I'm sure that...
499720	500720	They're lionizing them.
500720	503720	I'm absolutely positive that it's no exaggeration that you spent more time with them than I
503720	509720	did the whole 13 episodes because I hope that they understand that that means that what
509720	516720	I do, that the footsteps aren't there because I was masturbating in the bushes.
516720	517720	Yeah.
517720	520720	I mean, I think they know, but I don't...
520720	521720	No, they really...
521720	525720	They all admire you and I do think it's because they haven't spent much time with you.
527720	528720	No, they really...
528720	529720	And they're all so proud...
529720	533720	They're incredibly proud as they should be to be on such a great creative show.
533720	536720	And the one that I got to sit in on was no exception.
536720	537720	It's so out there.
537720	538720	It's so creative.
538720	539720	It's unbelievable.
539720	540720	And I got to the set and I really...
540720	543720	There was like a big chasm between...
543720	544720	You could tell.
544720	545720	They thought, oh, this is like a show creator guy.
545720	546720	A guy can give us jobs and everything.
546720	551720	And by the end, they really started to see me more as an equal, so I got the hell out
551720	552720	of there.
552720	553720	Yeah, that's good.
553720	554720	You got the luxury.
554720	555720	Yeah, that was a close one.
555720	558720	And your bit was amazing.
558720	559720	Oh, it was crazy.
559720	561720	I've seen the thing that the shrub cut together.
561720	564720	But no, I have to say, actually, like your cast, our cast was great.
564720	565720	They're wonderful.
565720	567720	But they hated each other, some of them.
567720	570720	No, they just functioned truly as a family in a great way.
570720	574720	You know, we had like a couple of leading men as brothers and there was a lot of stuff
574720	575720	going on there.
575720	576720	And they loved each other.
576720	577720	They were...
577720	578720	And they, you know, competed.
578720	582720	But for me, the challenge, it was always, you know, Fox, it was always dealing with
582720	583720	the network.
583720	584720	It was all the same stuff you do.
584720	585720	But as far as...
585720	591720	What I found out this season, and I'm an honest person, because these people, once they fire
591720	595720	you and bring you back, not because they respect you, but because if they brought you back,
595720	598720	it's because they don't give a shit anymore.
598720	602720	For that reason, I have been left to my own devices and I have truly found that I was
602720	603720	always the problem.
604720	607720	Well, and some of your devices.
607720	609720	I've seen a couple of the devices.
609720	612720	Yeah, well, left to my own actual self-built devices, yeah.
612720	614720	Yeah, that one device is really offensive.
614720	622720	I'm the Steve Jobs of Cronenbergian acting implements.
622720	631720	I have a fake twin that I invented a lot of weird, curvy, alien, tailbone-looking things
631720	634720	that I claim helped you act.
634720	637720	There's a table full of them and they're all flecked with fluids.
637720	641720	No, but the amazing thing about this, Sony, about your situation with Sony, because I
641720	646720	know they haven't been around this year, and I don't think it's because of that whale-boned
646720	647720	thing.
647720	649720	I think it's that...
649720	650720	I think they...
650720	655720	I've always thought in television they want you to push them out of it.
655720	656720	Really?
656720	657720	Yeah.
657720	658720	I mean, the whole system is set up.
658720	659720	Because they want to be able to say...
659720	660720	Well, yeah.
660720	661720	Maybe that's it.
661720	662720	They don't want to be accountable.
662720	665880	But also, they know the only hits that have ever come for them are the ones where the
665880	666880	guy said, fuck you.
666880	668680	I'm not doing it your way.
668680	669680	That's too selfless.
669680	671040	I don't believe that they're that selfless.
671040	674920	That's why they're still putting in their whole system where they've got all these checks
674920	678440	and balances, and then it takes somebody to come along, and on The Simpsons, they don't
678440	679440	give notes.
679440	680440	Right.
680440	683760	But those are all money-making things, and they never left you alone until...
683760	684760	No.
684800	687400	I mean, you and I, we share...
687400	693720	We're on the Simeon branch that is the low-rated great ape.
693720	695880	We had no tail.
695880	698800	It's called the non-wealthy ape.
698800	702960	It's the one branch of the ape that didn't become super wealthy.
702960	706840	But the Last Temptation of Christ, the guy who's put up on the cross...
706840	707840	What's his name?
707840	708840	Christ.
709840	712840	He read for Michael Bluth.
712840	715840	He was just...
715840	716840	Everything was so on the nose.
716840	717840	Yeah.
717840	719840	Everything was so overstated.
721840	723840	For a moment, you get to see...
723840	725840	Christ is up there on the cross, and you get...
725840	729840	I think that's the conceit of that movie and book and whatever, is that for a moment,
729840	733840	you get to see, okay, it's all fine and well to know that the guy got put up there and
733840	734840	forgive him, God.
734840	736840	They don't know what they're doing and all that stuff.
736840	740840	But for a moment in that story, what you get to explore and see is, okay, what if he
740840	746840	had said in a moment of passion, a moment of selfishness, all right, time out, forget
746840	747840	it.
747840	748840	I don't want to be Jesus ever again.
748840	753840	And you get to see that it would have sucked, that in the long run, it would have been shitty.
753840	759840	I feel like politically, season five, they said, okay, what if we did leave you alone,
759840	761840	you preening, whining fucker?
761840	763840	And the truth is, we all...
763840	765840	I am my own worst enemy.
765840	772840	I will stay at that office until the script is supposedly perfect, but it ain't ever perfect.
772840	777840	Dan, you're saying that you're not getting any trouble from the mucky mucks?
777840	780840	They're not making my life difficult at all, no.
780840	781840	No.
781840	783840	You lose something to rebel against.
783840	784840	I mean, that is part of it.
784840	787840	Part of it is you want to kind of stoke the fires of that anger a little bit.
787840	791840	We did a thing in the last season where we had a Google car, you know, that was going
791840	796840	to be the funny vehicle, because I'm all for just anything else funny you can get in
796840	798840	there, get it in there.
798840	801840	And remember once we were in a parking lot, there were all these air conditioning trucks
801840	804840	and Jim Vallee said to me, look, season six.
804840	806840	Everybody's got a funny car.
806840	811840	So we had Jason driving the Google car, and it was just not that funny, and then we heard
811840	813840	that Google wouldn't let us use it.
813840	816840	We were like, yes, we have a point of view now.
816840	818840	I get to be mad at something.
818840	819840	Yeah, we're mad at it.
819840	820840	And I think that's part of it.
820840	822840	It's oppositional defiant disorder.
822840	826840	It's like someone's going to make me mad.
826840	831840	We brought some integrated marketing into, as we've done, the great success in the past,
831840	833840	and they're really cool.
833840	838840	And then they said that they, well, we never call that that.
838840	839840	And I was like, yes.
839840	841840	And I was like, now I know what the scene's about.
841840	844840	Well, we are calling it a filet of fish sandwich now, my friend.
844840	848840	Or now the scene's about how you don't call it that, now how you like me.
848840	853840	And that really made me step back and go, is that your whole shtick, waiting around
853840	857840	to be told what not to do, and then you talk about how you can't do it?
857840	860840	I mean, you know, there's always something to be outraged about, right?
860840	865840	And I think, like I remember, we did this ninth or the tenth episode of the third season.
865840	867840	It was the first time we'd really gone super meta.
867840	869840	We'd done kind of things like that.
869840	872840	But we had no point of view in the show.
872840	874840	It was just something, nothing tied together.
874840	877840	Like the kid was going to a private school, and they were throwing a dinner.
877840	879840	It was just nothing.
879840	881840	And then I got a call saying, you're canceled.
881840	885840	It was like, best thing that ever happened to show nine.
885840	888840	And that was the one that we were making all these comments about, you know,
888840	892840	now there's going to be 3D segments and all that stuff that feels a little trite now, actually.
892840	900840	We did an episode this year where I wrote it in anger in like six hours out of sarcasm.
900840	901840	I know what that is.
901840	905840	I read something online that was somebody saying something.
905840	906840	We can't say what that is.
906840	907840	And I was like, fuck this.
907840	908840	Fuck this.
908840	909840	You want to see this shit?
909840	910840	Fuck it.
910840	911840	Fuck it.
911840	915840	And it's really one of the better episodes of the season.
915840	918840	It's me going, yeah, everyone want to go home by six?
918840	919840	Fine.
919840	920840	You're going home by six.
920840	921840	See how good the show is.
921840	924840	That's fine.
924840	926840	Fine episode.
926840	928840	A story, B story.
928840	929840	I get it.
929840	931840	Couple jokes for Mitch.
931840	932840	Dan or Mitch.
932840	933840	I'll start with Dan.
933840	939840	What's been the recipe, like, climate-wise for the worst episode of the season?
939840	940840	Definitely without a doubt.
940840	941840	I hope it wasn't putting me in it.
941840	942840	I bet it was.
942840	944840	Definitely without a doubt.
944840	949840	It's knowing in advance that you want to do X.
949840	955840	Now, you know, in the past, some of the episodes are, that's always,
956840	961840	that can generate your best episode knowing that you want to do,
961840	964840	it's going to be a blank episode.
964840	969840	But without a doubt, when you are up at 4 a.m. on a Sunday,
969840	972840	when the call time is 7 a.m. Monday and you're writing the scene
972840	974840	and no one knows what the fuck is going on,
974840	977840	the reason for the trouble starts with someone saying,
977840	980840	we have to do a Dungeons and Dragons sequel.
980840	982840	We have to do a zombie Halloween.
982840	985840	We have to do, Christmas is going to be this.
985840	987840	Because it's not organic.
987840	990840	Yeah, well, it's kind of like knowing what your theme is ahead of time.
990840	991840	And you'll see people.
991840	995840	You'll see, you think Ryan Murphy listens to this show?
997840	998840	Any second?
998840	1000840	Oh, these are some good pointers.
1000840	1003840	I'm going to use that one for American Horror Story.
1003840	1006840	I just picture him as having an Irish accent.
1006840	1008840	I'm Ryan Murphy.
1008840	1012840	I like to make the nice TV shows for the nice people.
1012840	1015840	Oh, just my experience though, he seems like a very nice guy.
1015840	1016840	Green Glovers.
1016840	1019840	Yellow Stars.
1020840	1023840	Little Purple Glee's.
1024840	1026840	Purple Glee's.
1029840	1032840	I don't want to talk about him.
1032840	1033840	He shoots at a stage.
1033840	1037840	But I remember he would say things when he was doing Niptuck
1037840	1040840	and talk about how, you know, I wanted to do a show about superficiality
1040840	1043840	and about how people are as only as deep as their skin.
1043840	1045840	I thought, no, you didn't.
1045840	1048840	You came up with that at some point.
1048840	1053840	But it is, whenever you start off, it's always a lie what you're starting with.
1053840	1056840	I mean, it's what I was just praising you about, about this show.
1056840	1058840	Like, I see you figure out your point as you're making it.
1058840	1059840	Oh, definitely.
1059840	1060840	Right?
1060840	1061840	Which I really admire.
1061840	1062840	Because otherwise, you're kind of full of shit.
1062840	1064840	You're going in with an idea of what you want to say already.
1064840	1065840	And I don't know.
1065840	1069840	I remember pitching arrested and saying the concept was going to be,
1069840	1074840	it's about a family that loses everything and is much happier because of it.
1074840	1077840	And none of that happened.
1077840	1080840	They didn't really lose that much.
1081840	1085840	They just sat around and stayed quasi-rich but very witty.
1085840	1086840	Yeah, right.
1087840	1090840	The funniest family in the world.
1090840	1091840	They're really funny.
1091840	1093840	The material possession ever.
1093840	1094840	Yeah.
1094840	1097840	And it really was the idea of like, you know, I say, oh, you know,
1097840	1099840	the husband and wife that haven't been sharing a bedroom,
1099840	1100840	they're now going to have to share a bedroom.
1100840	1102840	And there's all these sort of family values.
1102840	1105840	And then the first, like, three episodes, that got thrown in my face a lot.
1105840	1107840	Aren't they supposed to learn that it's better?
1108840	1109840	Oh, yeah.
1109840	1110840	No, I'm building to it.
1110840	1111840	They're going to learn it's better.
1111840	1114840	They're going to learn it's much better to be poor.
1114840	1118840	We had a, our post supervisor, didn't you work with Jake Ost?
1118840	1119840	Yeah.
1119840	1120840	On one show.
1120840	1121840	Not on a restive.
1121840	1124840	Doing the last couple episodes of season three, there was a point,
1124840	1126840	because it was like, well, how did season three end?
1126840	1128840	Chang was dressed as Napoleon.
1128840	1132840	There was a dragon in the sky and Abbot's head was the sun.
1132840	1133840	I don't know.
1133840	1135840	It's just the college, the community college experience.
1135840	1136840	Yeah.
1136840	1138840	I'm sound mixing it with Jay.
1138840	1142840	And I was like, Jake, could you think, is there a way we can go to some
1142840	1145840	kind of Japanese anime library and find some kind of something that sounds
1145840	1148840	like a light sword, but also can we mix it?
1148840	1149840	Because it needs to be funny too.
1149840	1152840	It needs to be an ironic take, like an ursatz light sword.
1152840	1156840	It sounds Japanese, but it needs to be like the Americanized version because
1156840	1157840	it's in Jeff's imagination.
1157840	1159840	And something like that.
1159840	1165840	And Jake Ost said, I signed on to a show about people going to a community
1165840	1166840	college.
1166840	1169840	He was being ironic of course.
1169840	1170840	He's a good sport.
1170840	1171840	Yeah.
1172840	1181840	But I was curious, like how, when you're surfing the wave of, yes, have
1181840	1182840	whatever you want.
1182840	1183840	There's water.
1183840	1186840	For the home audience, you have no idea the array that's out here right now.
1186840	1189840	The beverage array.
1189840	1191840	I'm in the Kettle One Alliance now.
1191840	1192840	I don't know if you're...
1192840	1193840	You brought in.
1193840	1195840	I don't know if...
1195840	1199840	And it's you guys against, what, like Captain Bacardi or whatever?
1199840	1201840	That's Ryan Murphy.
1201840	1203840	He's Jameson's.
1203840	1207840	You better not take me Jameson's.
1207840	1211840	I hear the Alliance is in a bitter struggle right now.
1211840	1213840	Against Ryan Murphy's Bacardi Alliance?
1213840	1214840	Yeah.
1214840	1215840	Or Jameson, whatever.
1215840	1216840	His Bacardi Empire.
1216840	1217840	Yeah.
1217840	1221840	All of the five major liquors are like the burrows in...
1221840	1224840	And Pod is working its way in too, which is going to throw off the Alliance.
1224840	1225840	Yeah.
1225840	1227840	Like you can't believe it's going to be like Japan.
1227840	1228840	Yeah.
1228840	1229840	And what was that?
1229840	1230840	Well, that's Netflix, right?
1230840	1232840	The Second World War.
1232840	1235840	I don't know the wars in order.
1235840	1236840	What was two?
1236840	1241840	I saw the first one.
1241840	1243840	But I want to know how...
1243840	1248840	When you were running a network show, how...
1248840	1252840	I appreciate you even trying to ask because you already know the answer.
1252840	1255840	You're trying to think of a way that we can get some information out to them.
1255840	1257840	But it's the exact same experience.
1257840	1259840	No, I don't know.
1259840	1266840	I want to know how dire it got in terms of the distance between what was in your brain
1266840	1268840	and what they were shooting on set.
1268840	1270840	I just want to know chronologically how bad it got.
1270840	1272840	Because there's stories about David Milch.
1272840	1277840	Literally, this is drama and this is David Milch, totally different thing.
1277840	1281840	But there's stories about there's a dude in his parking space waiting.
1281840	1282840	Wow.
1282840	1286840	He pulls up into the parking space and David Milch rolls out of the car onto his back.
1286840	1293840	And starts saying things into the air and the 20-year-old collects it in a jar
1293840	1296840	and throws it at the set.
1296840	1300840	And then they shoot that as it explodes out of the jar.
1300840	1302840	No, it wasn't like that at all.
1302840	1304840	It was really...
1304840	1307840	Was that Deadwood? What was that?
1307840	1310840	It was NYPD Blue.
1310840	1312840	Do you remember that documentary?
1312840	1313840	You saw him on his back?
1313840	1315840	Yeah, there was a shot of him on his back.
1315840	1322840	No, it was really a bad back, but he would sometimes be laying on his back on set
1322840	1325840	calling out lines to the actors and they'd shoot him.
1325840	1326840	That's what I heard.
1326840	1328840	They'd shoot the actors?
1328840	1329840	Oh, I see.
1329840	1330840	No, that's not enough.
1330840	1331840	Let's try it.
1331840	1333840	Maybe it's great for creativity.
1333840	1335840	Shall we get down there?
1335840	1336840	It wasn't like that at all.
1336840	1342840	In fact, I always had this illusion of myself as being reasonable.
1343840	1348840	I was accused once of it being rope-a-dope, is what it was called, basically.
1348840	1350840	Because you said you were a nice guy.
1350840	1355840	Well, I made it an effort not to be defensive,
1355840	1357840	which is very hard to do when you're hearing notes,
1357840	1359840	because you just want everything out of your mouth.
1359840	1361840	If you've created anything, you want to say,
1361840	1363840	No, you don't get it. I don't want to do it your way.
1363840	1366840	But I believe in trying not to be defensive
1366840	1370840	and trying to let in what people are saying.
1370840	1373840	But then I wouldn't always act on it.
1373840	1374840	I mean, I would try to take in, like,
1374840	1379840	Okay, so what they're saying is they don't see that this character cares for his son.
1379840	1380840	And that's a drag.
1380840	1384840	I want to up that, but I also don't want to sell it out and all those things.
1384840	1390840	But I worked so hard on addressing their notes that in a funny way,
1390840	1392840	I don't think they even saw that I was doing it,
1392840	1395840	because I could change the sentence a little bit
1395840	1398840	and I could put this scene earlier, but they didn't want that.
1398840	1400840	You're not going to believe me.
1400840	1402840	I'm sure you're on the same way.
1402840	1404840	Because I came up doing improv, so I would go,
1404840	1408840	There's no difference between someone in a suit saying,
1408840	1410840	Could you put a dog in it?
1410840	1413840	Or, I'm not tracking Annie's character in this scene.
1413840	1416840	There's no difference between that and bringing up someone from the audience
1416840	1418840	and having them do the sound effects.
1418840	1420840	It can be invigorating.
1420840	1422840	And there's a whole creativity that comes out of,
1422840	1424840	Okay, you've got this house that's built.
1424840	1425840	This is the foundation, but let's see.
1425840	1426840	If I move the stairs,
1426840	1429840	all I'd have to do is bolster the stairs and still get to the second.
1429840	1430840	And what they're thinking is,
1430840	1432840	No, we thought you were going to bulldoze it.
1432840	1433840	Right, and so sometimes they go,
1433840	1435840	I don't understand, you're not following my notes.
1435840	1437840	I'm following the note behind your note.
1437840	1442840	I mean, you were saying that you wanted a flower on the guy's head,
1442840	1446840	but what you meant was there wasn't a prettiness to the scene.
1446840	1452840	And so I did that by the guy punching the dog.
1452840	1454840	Punching the ugly dog.
1455840	1457840	Getting rid of one ugly animal.
1457840	1458840	Punished the ugly dog by punching it.
1458840	1460840	Add an ugly animal, remove it.
1460840	1461840	I don't know.
1461840	1463840	I was probably going to try.
1463840	1468840	Like a relatively large volume of notes that are given to me.
1468840	1472840	No, I was always very surprised that they did not see that I was doing that.
1472840	1474840	And then I would get really specific notes.
1474840	1476840	There was one point where somebody said to me,
1476840	1479840	Why are you doing this joke three times?
1479840	1485840	And I really was like, Oh God, is that right?
1485840	1488840	Should it be five times?
1488840	1491840	Why is one a set up and one why is a thing?
1491840	1492840	And why is one a punch line?
1492840	1494840	I remember the joke.
1494840	1496840	It was when, it was Job talking about,
1496840	1499840	it was just this little flight of fancy where someone said,
1499840	1501840	Job said, Did you see the new Poof?
1501840	1505840	Which was what the magic magazine was called in a restaurant.
1505840	1507840	And then Job kind of misinterpreting.
1507840	1509840	And he said, Gary the new PA, is he gay?
1509840	1512840	Oh God, I did something that could be taken the wrong way.
1512840	1515840	And then we see really, I think we see four things that he did
1515840	1516840	that could be taken the wrong way.
1516840	1519840	The last of them, which is the one that this executive pointed out,
1519840	1525840	was him with Gary on his lap on a chair, rocking back and forth,
1525840	1528840	saying, Well, it's not doing it now.
1528840	1533840	And both of them just looking and trying to feel what the chair is doing.
1533840	1535840	Why are you doing that so many times?
1535840	1536840	Why can't you just do it once?
1536840	1541840	And it really was a fundamental understanding shift for me
1541840	1545840	when I realized, you think I'm being an artist
1545840	1547840	or being something that's going to cost you money.
1547840	1550840	I'm trying to make this popular.
1550840	1552840	That was the fundamental misunderstanding.
1552840	1554840	This is my version of mainstream comedy.
1554840	1556840	There is no such thing.
1556840	1557840	I hope there isn't.
1557840	1560840	I would think that there would be a person whose stuff you had never seen
1560840	1562840	because they wouldn't get off the starting block.
1562840	1565840	There's no such thing as a TV comedy writer.
1565840	1568840	Listen to those words, TV comedy.
1568840	1569840	Exactly.
1569840	1571840	Before you get to the word writer,
1571840	1575840	you have long since made the decision to sell out.
1575840	1577840	You want people to like you.
1577840	1580840	It's like saying magician masseuse.
1580840	1582840	Reclusive magician.
1582840	1584840	Reclusive magician.
1584840	1585840	What?
1585840	1589840	You're not going to be one of those artsy fartsy magician masseuses, are you?
1589840	1593840	The guy who says, who needs someone to know that the corner disappeared
1594840	1595840	and then rubs your shoulders?
1595840	1597840	No, I'd want people to be happy.
1597840	1599840	Well, why does it have to be a French franc that disappears?
1599840	1601840	Why can't it be a half dollar?
1601840	1603840	An American half dollar.
1603840	1606840	I know you don't want to dumb it down.
1606840	1610840	They preemptively make you feel like a snob.
1610840	1612840	No, I am trying as hard as I can.
1612840	1613840	That's the sad fact.
1613840	1615840	I'm trying as hard as I can.
1615840	1618840	Well, you and I both made, I don't even know if it was a decision,
1618840	1620840	but it was based on our personalities.
1620840	1622840	Let's do a show that we would like.
1622840	1624840	I mean, there are people in any field.
1624840	1625840	I learned it from you.
1625840	1626840	I don't know what your excuse is.
1626840	1627840	I swear to God.
1627840	1629840	I learned it from watching Arrested Development.
1629840	1634840	It was the moment when the Bluths, for the third time in the show,
1634840	1637840	lost their money, made fun of someone for being cowardly
1637840	1644840	and revealed that the family as a whole does not know what chickens sound like.
1644840	1647840	And everyone's going, cuddle, cuddle, cuddle.
1647840	1651840	Jason Bateman's going, has anyone in this family heard a chicken?
1651840	1653840	And I was like, holy shit.
1653840	1657840	And it wasn't like, holy shit, comedy can be so layered on all this stuff.
1657840	1663840	What it was was, holy shit, I'm supposed to be making myself laugh.
1663840	1670840	I'm supposed to be, like there is no, there's no difference between the job
1670840	1673840	of being funny for other people and being funny for yourself.
1673840	1675840	It is the same thing.
1675840	1677840	It is the crazy thing about...
1677840	1679840	A pause in this crowd that will get you.
1679840	1682840	I love somebody who can applaud themselves.
1682840	1685840	I denounced racism yesterday.
1685840	1686840	Crickets.
1686840	1690840	These people are, these people hate minorities, they love comedy.
1690840	1693840	There are a lot of people...
1693840	1694840	I think they were here yesterday.
1694840	1695840	I don't know.
1695840	1696840	Sorry.
1696840	1698840	I love the Saturday practice shows.
1698840	1701840	This thing is so nailed down.
1701840	1702840	Am I up?
1702840	1703840	Was that your line?
1703840	1706840	Rigorously rehearsed.
1706840	1708840	Rigorously rehearsed.
1708840	1714840	Mitch, Mitch, don't ad lib.
1714840	1721840	We opened in two nights, you guys.
1721840	1725840	I want to see you guys here at 7 a.m. and dress for movement.
1725840	1729840	Are the Cirque guys coming or is it still us just marking them off with tape?
1729840	1730840	They'll be here.
1730840	1733840	Because they're going to throw us when they start doing their gymnastics.
1733840	1737840	But there is a question a good interviewer would ask you in there,
1737840	1739840	which is, where did you learn it from?
1739840	1741840	Because you're a couple years older than me.
1741840	1742840	No, I listen.
1742840	1744840	It's very nice that you say that you learned it from me.
1744840	1745840	But we're all...
1745840	1746840	No, I'm not kidding.
1746840	1748840	I'm telling you, in terms of specifically,
1748840	1750840	in terms of when sitting down to write a TV comedy script,
1750840	1752840	I absolutely learned it from you.
1752840	1753840	I also learned...
1753840	1756840	I picked up Tina Fey doing 30 Rock.
1756840	1759840	I definitely was like, holy shit, this is a pace that you can have.
1759840	1761840	But I would argue, I don't know if she'd disagree,
1761840	1764840	but she'd disagree that she got that from you.
1764840	1765840	I don't know.
1765840	1766840	I don't know if you...
1766840	1768840	I think she'd disagree.
1768840	1771840	But I think that you changed things with the...
1771840	1772840	I got it from Ryan.
1772840	1773840	I don't know if you watched Nip Tuck.
1773840	1776840	I got a lot of it.
1776840	1779840	I will say, I think...
1779840	1783840	I remember being a kid, this will date me a little bit,
1783840	1787840	and watching Get Smart and thinking, like a little kid.
1787840	1790840	How come all the shows sound the same but there's one
1790840	1793840	where it doesn't sound the same?
1793840	1795840	Basically, what I was getting at is like,
1795840	1797840	it's a guy's sense of humor.
1797840	1799840	Whatever you think of that sense of humor,
1799840	1802840	it was clear that that was Buck Henry and Mel Brooks.
1802840	1806840	And for me, I think I remember seeing Larry Sanders' show.
1806840	1807840	That was a revelation.
1807840	1810840	I remember seeing episodes where it would just end
1810840	1813840	and you'd have to do a little thinking yourself.
1813840	1816840	You'd have to say, oh, he's in hell.
1816840	1818840	You know, they didn't explain it.
1818840	1820840	He didn't apologize.
1820840	1822840	That was amazing to me.
1822840	1825840	And I also came up with a lot of writers that would say things like,
1825840	1827840	well, we could do the old.
1827840	1829840	That was said in a lot of rooms I was in.
1829840	1831840	And I remember at that point thinking,
1831840	1833840	I don't want to ever do the old.
1833840	1834840	But unfortunately...
1834840	1836840	I often want to do the old.
1836840	1838840	I scramble for it.
1838840	1841840	I go, oh, this could be like the old thing
1841840	1843840	because I don't know what I'm doing.
1843840	1846840	But that's because you're inventing it every time.
1846840	1847840	That's what I try to do.
1847840	1850840	Try to invent it every time and that's the only way you're going to laugh.
1850840	1853840	But then it's just a bunch of people with their heads up their asses.
1853840	1854840	I don't know.
1854840	1857840	I don't know which version of me is more marketable.
1857840	1860840	Is it the version that is trying to be like other people
1860840	1862840	or is it the version that is...
1862840	1863840	No.
1863840	1866840	Listen, we're all... nobody's that independent.
1866840	1868840	I probably could go through an episode of Arrested Development
1868840	1870840	and say, oh, that's an Albert Brooks thing.
1870840	1871840	That's a Woody Allen thing.
1871840	1872840	That's a John Cleese thing.
1872840	1875840	You know, it all gets filtered through somehow.
1875840	1878840	But for the most part, if you're trying to make yourself laugh,
1878840	1881840	you know, we happen to have chosen a field
1881840	1883840	that neither of us are really right for
1883840	1885840	because television is all about repetition.
1885840	1888840	That's what it does best, maybe up until the current era.
1888840	1889840	Amen.
1889840	1890840	Now, let's make an edit here.
1890840	1893840	And for the podcast listeners, there's a brief silence
1893840	1896840	and then some clicking sounds and then two gunshots.
1899840	1900840	Right.
1901840	1903840	Can we just get a... can we get a gas?
1903840	1905840	But it's got to be clean, no laughter.
1905840	1906840	Just everyone going...
1909840	1910840	Sounds to be amazing.
1910840	1911840	And then...
1911840	1912840	And then...
1912840	1913840	And then...
1913840	1915840	About like a three second silence
1915840	1916840	and then slow applause.
1918840	1920840	But preceded by...
1920840	1922840	I think I know how to help them.
1923840	1925840	I'll cast a bit of me Ryan Murphy witchcraft.
1925840	1926840	Oh, it's Ryan Murphy.
1927840	1928840	Ryan Murphy.
1928840	1933840	Do you just need some voodoo magic from the bayou?
1934840	1935840	Irish voodoo?
1935840	1936840	Irish voodoo?
1937840	1938840	I think...
1938840	1940840	Am I talking about the same guy as the...
1940840	1941840	Yeah, yeah.
1941840	1943840	Yeah, the glee guy is also the voodoo witch guy, right?
1943840	1944840	The voodoo witch guy.
1944840	1947840	He was raised in the bayou and then he went to Ireland.
1948840	1952840	And then he decided to comment on superficiality in America.
1953840	1955840	And that's why that's so rich.
1958840	1961840	Speaking of diversity, let's bring out Kumail Najiani.
1967840	1971840	That is the single greatest intro I've ever gotten.
1973840	1974840	Speaking of diversity...
1974840	1976840	No, you're supposed to do the speaking of diversity now.
1976840	1977840	Yeah.
1977840	1978840	Would you mind speaking about diversity?
1978840	1980840	I think it's good, guys.
1980840	1982840	I am on board.
1982840	1985840	For one thing, it's my sole recourse to an intro.
1985840	1986840	Yeah.
1986840	1988840	Can I say something that happened backstage?
1988840	1989840	Is that okay, Mitch?
1989840	1990840	Sure.
1990840	1993840	We were hanging out back there and Mitch came in.
1993840	1996840	Mitch Hurwitz, creator of Arrested Development.
1996840	1999840	I got two intros and you got barely one.
1999840	2001840	I didn't get any intros.
2001840	2004840	But he came in and he shook my hand and he was like,
2004840	2007840	oh hey, we met a couple months ago and I was like,
2007840	2012840	you will never have to remind me of when I met you.
2013840	2014840	Because you're Indian?
2015840	2017840	We never forget.
2018840	2020840	I'm Pakistani, but that's fine.
2022840	2024840	Yeah, if you squint, I look Indian.
2024840	2025840	I hate Indians.
2025840	2026840	Yeah, yeah.
2026840	2027840	Oh my God.
2027840	2028840	Mitch, thanks for coming.
2028840	2029840	You've been great.
2030840	2032840	Yeah, I'm the opposite of Indian.
2032840	2033840	Yeah.
2033840	2034840	Assholes.
2034840	2036840	The opposite of Indian.
2037840	2038840	That's your drama.
2038840	2041840	Yeah, we're the opposite of Indians and the opposite of...
2042840	2043840	Jews, I guess.
2044840	2045840	Not fond of them either.
2046840	2048840	A lot of you go into cardiology.
2048840	2049840	My people?
2049840	2050840	Don't they?
2050840	2051840	Oh, yeah.
2051840	2052840	Well, doctor, doctor.
2052840	2054840	Yeah, we're mostly doctors, yeah.
2055840	2058840	Is that why you feel comforted by your voice, maybe?
2059840	2060840	I don't know.
2062840	2064840	I wonder if you'd feel comfortable.
2064840	2066840	I wonder if I've ever had a doctor that was telling me
2066840	2067840	my heart would be okay and he had...
2067840	2069840	Yeah, my dad's a doctor.
2069840	2071840	I think my mom's waiting for me to play her doctor
2071840	2075840	in a show so she can commit suicide while she's watching it.
2076840	2077840	She wouldn't like that.
2077840	2079840	No, I think she would be like, oh, if I...
2079840	2081840	Now you're mocking your father and...
2081840	2082840	That's a happy thing there.
2082840	2083840	No, it's a happy thing.
2083840	2084840	Oh, commit suicide.
2084840	2086840	Oh, commit suicide's a good thing.
2086840	2088840	It's the most honorable death possible.
2088840	2089840	Right, right.
2089840	2090840	Oh, boy.
2090840	2091840	Here he goes again.
2094840	2095840	Oh, boy.
2096840	2098840	We have to set ourselves on fire to get into heaven.
2100840	2103840	Camille, Camille, save it for your blog.
2104840	2108840	Did I read correctly that you were voted sexiest man of the year
2108840	2110840	by Salon magazine?
2110840	2111840	Yeah, it wasn't about...
2111840	2112840	What?
2112840	2114840	It was some person decided.
2115840	2117840	Jason Salon decided.
2118840	2119840	I don't know.
2119840	2120840	Yeah, it was weird.
2121840	2122840	It's very cool.
2122840	2125840	It's obviously, and not to say anything about it,
2125840	2129840	but Salon, they have a lot of white guilt in there,
2129840	2131840	and I think this was their way of like,
2131840	2133840	hey, this should make you guys feel better.
2134840	2136840	I mean, you're a very attractive man,
2136840	2138840	but I can see the guilt in that.
2139840	2143840	What I also like is that the description of the article was like,
2143840	2147840	we didn't go after guys who hang out in the gym or anything.
2149840	2151840	Why did you have to put that in there?
2152840	2156840	Yeah, we used the term sexy and a little looser around so long.
2159840	2162840	One of them is just a really great orange I ate yesterday.
2164840	2167840	Most of the other ones is ten, and you're the only human here.
2168840	2169840	I'm the only human.
2169840	2171840	All right, check out this park bench.
2171840	2173840	The ergonomics are the new pecs.
2174840	2176840	Number three, H.A.R.A.M.A. episodes.
2176840	2177840	Number three, calcium.
2178840	2184840	Salon.com is number six on their own list of sexiest men.
2187840	2189840	Come on, that's silly. You're very sexy.
2189840	2190840	Thank you, guys.
2190840	2193840	Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
2194840	2195840	Do something really sexy.
2195840	2197840	Take your shirt off. Take your fucking shirt off.
2198840	2199840	Take your shirt off.
2199840	2200840	Come on, H.A.R.A.M.A.M.A.
2201840	2203840	You're a public figure. It's not harassment.
2204840	2206840	I'm being bullied by Mitch Hurwitz.
2206840	2209840	It's not bullying if you're voted sexy.
2215840	2216840	You're a public figure now.
2217840	2218840	Quick, quick at it.
2218840	2219840	We're going to go back on the music.
2219840	2220840	Cheer like you took a shirt off.
2221840	2222840	We'll let the music go for a second.
2229840	2230840	Jesus Christ!
2231840	2232840	Holy cow!
2232840	2233840	Look at those tips!
2233840	2237840	If we could do a gunshot and a gasp again.
2238840	2241840	Oh my God, his pecs look so good. Mitch, you thinking what I'm thinking?
2243840	2244840	Gasp.
2249840	2250840	Oh my God.
2250840	2251840	Gasp take.
2251840	2252840	That's great.
2252840	2254840	This show's going to take a couple days to come out.
2255840	2257840	This one will not drop tomorrow.
2257840	2259840	No, you've got to go up to Skywalker Ranch.
2260840	2267840	We have to go back and add the sound effects of me and Mitch sucking each other's dicks for the last half hour.
2268840	2270840	You don't need to add sound effects.
2272840	2274840	The tape was rolling backstage, you guys.
2275840	2277840	Sexily said. Sexily said.
2279840	2284840	I actually didn't answer my parents' calls for three days because of that article.
2285840	2286840	Really?
2286840	2287840	Yeah, I really did.
2287840	2288840	Because?
2288840	2289840	Because your phone is ringing off the hook?
2289840	2292840	No, nobody, they are calling.
2292840	2295840	They want to talk about it, and I don't want to talk to them about it.
2296840	2298840	And they're thinking, oh, now he's Mr. Sexy.
2298840	2300840	He doesn't pick up my phone calls anymore.
2300840	2302840	Now he'll never go to medical school.
2302840	2304840	I wish he was Dr. Sexy, yeah.
2306840	2309840	What do you think your mom's take on that would be?
2310840	2316840	Well, I'll tell you what was weird is that in the article they wrote that I had a fundamentalist upbringing,
2316840	2321840	which is a very specific word, and it is not what I had at a conservative,
2321840	2323840	and it took a lot to get them to take that word out.
2323840	2326840	And my brother texted me like, what the fuck?
2327840	2329840	Did you have a different upbringing than me?
2331840	2334840	And I was like, yeah, they made me do push-ups and pull-ups in the back.
2334840	2336840	I was doing the monkey bars.
2336840	2340840	They're always doing that when they show those terrorist training.
2340840	2341840	That's how you get sexy.
2341840	2342840	I was just doing monkey bars.
2342840	2345840	Yeah, you must be amazing at the monkey bars now.
2345840	2348840	I can jump into tires really well.
2348840	2349840	Yeah.
2349840	2353840	It's great. It's tough to get a bunch of guys together on a Saturday just to go use the monkey bars.
2353840	2356840	It's tough to not get in a league.
2356840	2361840	My favorite thing in war movies was when a bunch of guys stood in a line with bayonets and they had to go stab a sack.
2361840	2362840	Yeah.
2362840	2363840	Now you're ready.
2364840	2366840	Let's go and make sack land.
2366840	2369840	You land in Vietnam, and you're like, well, there are no playgrounds here.
2369840	2370840	We haven't prepared.
2370840	2372840	They're no evenly spaced.
2373840	2375840	Everyone here has arms and legs and is shooting at me.
2375840	2376840	Yeah.
2376840	2378840	Why did we spend months going down that slide?
2378840	2379840	Yeah.
2379840	2384840	I could use a seesaw as a death weapon, but we have not here.
2385840	2390840	Do you ever have to really go under all the barbed wire with a drill sergeant kicking your butt down?
2390840	2394840	Have they now figured out to put barbed wire all the way to the bottom?
2396840	2397840	Sixty years later.
2397840	2398840	Yeah, we've got to do this.
2398840	2400840	We've got to put it on the ground.
2400840	2401840	Just lay it down.
2401840	2402840	Stop putting it up on stands.
2402840	2403840	It's easier.
2404840	2407840	And make this wall get these ropes out of here.
2409840	2410840	Well, that's how they're getting over.
2410840	2413840	For God's sakes, this is Normandy, not an open house.
2413840	2414840	Who said they couldn't?
2414840	2416840	Who said they wouldn't be able to climb the ropes?
2416840	2417840	Who said that?
2418840	2420840	That's all we've been practicing for years.
2420840	2422840	Who said the ropes would scare them?
2423840	2424840	They're using the ropes.
2424840	2425840	They're climbing the ropes.
2425840	2426840	They don't think they're snakes.
2426840	2428840	You put knots in them.
2429840	2430840	They'll never get here.
2430840	2433840	We have a bridge made of tires protecting us.
2434840	2437840	No, look at their wide stance while they run.
2438840	2440840	Yeah, they'll waddle over.
2443840	2444840	What does it say?
2444840	2446840	How do you train someone to become a killing machine?
2446840	2449840	You can't, so you're like, oh, distract them with tires and ropes.
2449840	2450840	Okay, four square, guys.
2450840	2451840	Let's go.
2451840	2452840	Yeah, exactly.
2452840	2456840	They do always say, if you watch a word documentary, that's the first thing that they always say.
2456840	2459840	All the GIs will say, the veterans that they interview, they're like, well, we got there.
2459840	2463840	And we had not prepared for this.
2463840	2464840	No shit.
2465840	2466840	Definitely not.
2466840	2472840	No one has ever invaded a military training ground in Minnesota.
2472840	2475840	There was one wall, but we all wanted to hide behind it.
2475840	2477840	Nobody wanted to go over.
2477840	2478840	All the people could move.
2478840	2481840	None of them were stationary sack people.
2482840	2485840	But now the training is very much like the actual war, right?
2485840	2487840	Because it's like, end of the game now.
2487840	2488840	Why are you looking at it?
2488840	2489840	Oh, I bet it is.
2489840	2490840	I caught up to you.
2490840	2492840	I'm looking at you guys as people who might read the news.
2492840	2493840	Yeah.
2493840	2498840	I did hear that Amazon is going to use drones to deliver their fucking...
2498840	2499840	Isn't that crazy?
2499840	2500840	Not really.
2500840	2501840	Where's the end of an Amazon story?
2501840	2502840	Is that what it was?
2502840	2505840	They're going to use drones to send out the same...
2505840	2509840	To deliver, like, just, you know, a copy of Eat, Pray, Love.
2509840	2512840	Or 30,000 feet sky.
2513840	2514840	A Niptuck box set.
2514840	2516840	A Google Chromecast.
2516840	2519840	A little parachute comes down and lands on my mailbox?
2519840	2523840	I think they haven't worked out all the details yet.
2523840	2524840	I don't know how...
2524840	2527840	I mean, there's going to be collateral damage.
2527840	2530840	They are tied to bombs, yeah.
2530840	2531840	And I don't mean...
2531840	2534840	But that switch is set to off.
2534840	2536840	Not that that was a bomb.
2537840	2543840	If they're delivering your groceries like that, the bomb switch is off.
2543840	2544840	Yeah.
2544840	2545840	Yeah.
2545840	2546840	I hope so.
2546840	2547840	I hope they don't get confused.
2547840	2550840	And then we're getting bombs and someone in Pakistan has the Niptuck box set.
2550840	2552840	What the hell?
2552840	2554840	This is actually a good wedding present.
2554840	2555840	Thank you.
2555840	2556840	Yes.
2557840	2560840	This is Sony Aibo dog.
2560840	2563840	Just talking about our direct TV.
2563840	2564840	Yeah.
2564840	2565840	We got an Apple TV.
2565840	2568840	We have nothing to plug it into.
2568840	2572840	I told you, Dan, that I did a couple USO tours with Drew Carey.
2572840	2576840	We did improv for troops around before the Iraq invasion but after Afghanistan.
2576840	2579840	And they took us into the middle of a desert.
2579840	2584840	The war room was this big yellow building in the middle of nowhere in the desert.
2584840	2586840	This big yellow metal building.
2586840	2589840	And in that building was more bandwidth going into it at that time.
2589840	2592840	They said that the Kremlin and maybe the Pentagon...
2592840	2593840	I can't believe it's true.
2593840	2594840	The whole war was being run from there.
2594840	2596840	And there was a war games.
2596840	2598840	You went up to the top floor.
2598840	2601840	There were these giant tilted...
2601840	2605840	Tinted windows looking down on a sea of computers and people in front of these computers.
2605840	2609840	And on these walls, these giant movie screens of...
2609840	2611840	One is a satellite map.
2611840	2614840	One can change to different arenas or areas.
2614840	2619840	Another, a giant map of the whole region and digital blips of everything.
2619840	2621840	The blue is medical units.
2621840	2623840	The orange is infantry units.
2623840	2624840	The red...
2624840	2626840	And then just chuck and buck on one of them.
2626840	2629840	For some reason they were just chuck and buck.
2629840	2631840	Not just anything what came out of it.
2631840	2632840	Not far off.
2632840	2633840	You're actually not far off.
2633840	2634840	It was CNN on the other one.
2634840	2635840	Really?
2635840	2638840	Yeah, which is now not much different.
2638840	2642840	But we were up there and we walked up there and they turned off a couple computer screens.
2642840	2643840	They left a couple on.
2643840	2650840	And one was a picture of a black and white aerial satellite photo.
2650840	2652840	And I asked like a colonel or something.
2652840	2653840	I said, what's this?
2653840	2656840	He goes, oh, this photo was taken five minutes ago.
2656840	2657840	He goes, we can do it in color.
2657840	2658840	We can do it however.
2658840	2661840	I go, we can also have it like right now, but we don't really need to.
2661840	2663840	They had Instagram before we did.
2663840	2664840	Oh, yeah.
2664840	2665840	Oh, that's what...
2665840	2668840	We could do this with Sierra...
2668840	2670840	X-Pro 2.
2670840	2672840	Nashville, would you have a little thing with that?
2672840	2673840	Nashville.
2673840	2676840	It was just a Taliban pictures of stuff they were eating.
2676840	2677840	It was a picture...
2677840	2678840	There was a picture of a guy.
2679840	2682840	They said like BFF and there was a heart.
2682840	2683840	When she were here...
2683840	2685840	And then there was a picture of someone...
2685840	2686840	They zoomed in really close.
2686840	2688840	And it was a picture of an espresso with a heart in it with a phone.
2688840	2689840	Yeah.
2689840	2690840	Wow.
2690840	2691840	So they were really...
2691840	2692840	I asked the guy.
2692840	2693840	I said like...
2693840	2694840	He zooms in on a guy.
2694840	2695840	And you could see a guy that...
2695840	2696840	Who was that?
2696840	2697840	He goes, just a farmer.
2697840	2698840	He's probably like...
2698840	2699840	You could zoom in on guys?
2699840	2700840	Yeah.
2700840	2701840	I go, what's the resolution you have here?
2701840	2702840	He goes, if we load it in...
2702840	2705840	The resolution is to fuck humanity.
2705840	2706840	Exactly.
2706840	2707840	Exactly.
2707840	2708840	Fuck that guy for farming.
2708840	2709840	That's the resolution.
2709840	2712840	Our resolution is to win a thousand times over.
2712840	2714840	He said, see that guy with the pile of rocks?
2714840	2716840	We don't just make it New Year's Eve.
2716840	2719840	I said, could you see if the guy's shoes were tied or untied?
2719840	2723840	He goes, if you were holding a dime, I could tell you what year it was.
2723840	2726840	But the good news is he has no money and shoes that don't lay.
2726840	2727840	Exactly.
2727840	2728840	Just don't worry about it.
2728840	2730840	That's what I like about you, Mitch.
2730840	2731840	We're going to...
2731840	2732840	Bright side.
2732840	2733840	You're a bright side.
2733840	2735840	We have a lot of wasted resolution.
2735840	2736840	So then...
2736840	2737840	They have no money.
2737840	2739840	That's how they've chosen to evade us.
2739840	2742840	Living in games and not having a dime in their hand.
2742840	2743840	Yeah.
2743840	2746840	There's a radio shack, flight simulator joystick there.
2746840	2747840	And he goes, watch this.
2747840	2751840	He zooms back and then you see some details of a farm and then a thing.
2751840	2753840	And you see borders of countries.
2753840	2754840	Then you see the region.
2754840	2755840	Then you see the planet Earth.
2755840	2757840	And it's upside down because they were doing it for that ride.
2757840	2761840	Then he pulls back and it's Oprah holding it in her hands.
2761840	2764840	I was going to say just one masculine claw.
2764840	2765840	Oh, too far.
2765840	2766840	Too far.
2766840	2767840	Go back.
2767840	2768840	Go back.
2768840	2769840	Go back.
2769840	2770840	They turned the monitor off.
2770840	2771840	Oh, shit.
2771840	2772840	Redacted.
2772840	2773840	Redacted.
2773840	2775840	And I said to him, I said, and you guys can't find Osama bin Laden?
2775840	2777840	And he kind of gave me a look.
2777840	2781840	If we find Osama, this is all over.
2781840	2782840	Yeah, exactly.
2782840	2784840	He gave me a look like...
2784840	2787840	We find what they ask us to look for, man.
2787840	2788840	We went on a plane.
2788840	2791840	No one had thought to say, hey, look for Osama.
2791840	2792840	No.
2793840	2794840	He said...
2794840	2797840	I go, we have more bandwidth coming into this building than any building ever.
2797840	2800840	And I said, what does that mean exactly to...
2800840	2801840	Explain that to me.
2801840	2805840	And he goes, if it exists as information, I can get it right now.
2805840	2806840	I'm gay.
2806840	2811840	Dan, I'm trying to tell a story.
2811840	2814840	It's more of a cataloging of the decade.
2814840	2817840	We'll table your homosexuality for a moment, Dan.
2817840	2819840	I don't know what that test was.
2819840	2821840	The story's taking place in the past.
2821840	2823840	Then we go on this plane with a bunch of people.
2823840	2825840	There's all these antennae off the bottom of it.
2825840	2826840	And they fly around.
2826840	2827840	And I forget the name of the plane.
2827840	2828840	And there's all these people.
2828840	2830840	They're linguists.
2830840	2831840	And they listen.
2831840	2832840	And I walked on the plane.
2832840	2834840	And they all turned off their screens.
2834840	2837840	Like, that's some top secret shit.
2837840	2840840	And I was talking to a guy that works on that plane.
2840840	2841840	I go, so what are you guys listening for?
2841840	2844840	He goes, they ask us to listen for certain communications.
2844840	2845840	We find Taliban people.
2845840	2846840	We find this.
2846840	2847840	We find that.
2847840	2848840	We find targets.
2848840	2849840	We radio that in to the bombers or the fighters.
2849840	2850840	And they go in there.
2850840	2851840	And they get those targets.
2851840	2853840	I go, how do you know that those targets are still there when the bombers get there?
2853840	2854840	And he goes, that's not our department.
2854840	2855840	That's crazy.
2855840	2857840	And so I said, well, what can you hear?
2857840	2861840	And he goes, I can't tell you everything that we can hear, because that's top secret.
2861840	2865840	But I will say that this enemy in particular has no idea what we can hear.
2865840	2866840	And he goes, for instance.
2866840	2868840	He probably thought, well, I can really tell you.
2868840	2874840	Because it's not like you're ever going to tell a Pakistani.
2874840	2877840	With all that change in your pockets and those shoelaces.
2878840	2882840	That you would tell this whole story to a Shia Muslim.
2893840	2895840	So he goes, I will say this.
2895840	2896840	We can listen to you.
2896840	2900840	If you're at home and your phones are hung up, like your cell phone or your landlines are hung up.
2900840	2902840	We can listen to you through those.
2902840	2903840	Come on.
2904840	2906840	And that's what you can tell me?
2906840	2909840	And he goes, they know that, kind of.
2909840	2911840	But we're catching them on their cell phones all the time.
2911840	2913840	I go, so tell me what you can tell me.
2913840	2916840	And he goes, if it travels over a wave, we can hear it.
2916840	2919840	And I go, aren't our voices traveling over waves right now?
2919840	2922840	And he gave me the same smile the other guy did.
2922840	2924840	His mom said, what?
2925840	2927840	I said, go get this fucking guy.
2927840	2929840	It's like not my department.
2929840	2933840	They tell us where to go, what to listen to, what to do.
2933840	2937840	Is this one of those situations where then the real guy comes in and is like, get to work.
2937840	2939840	And that guy's the janitor.
2940840	2941840	I'm sorry.
2941840	2943840	Are you doing it again?
2943840	2945840	He gives your diamond shoelaces.
2945840	2947840	I'm sorry, but it's Drew Carey.
2947840	2949840	It's Drew Carey.
2949840	2951840	By your own mission, this was before Iraq.
2951840	2955840	May I hazard a guess as to why they couldn't find Osama bin Laden?
2955840	2957840	This could get really political, guys.
2957840	2958840	I hope you're okay with this.
2958840	2961840	No one listens this far into the podcast.
2962840	2963840	Right?
2963840	2965840	He might be in Iraq.
2965840	2967840	Can't find him.
2967840	2968840	You think why?
2968840	2969840	That's why?
2969840	2973840	I think he was somewhere else and he wasn't high priority.
2973840	2975840	Osama wasn't?
2975840	2976840	No, I don't think.
2976840	2978840	I really do believe with the intelligence.
2978840	2982840	You mean he was in Iraq in the tent next to where Jeff was?
2982840	2984840	Drew Carey.
2984840	2985840	Yeah, yeah.
2985840	2989840	Listen, I actually just watched that Oliver Stone documentary, which is amazing.
2989840	2992840	If anybody hasn't seen it, the untold history of the United States.
2992840	2993840	I can't tell you what it is.
2993840	2995840	It's untold.
2995840	2997840	It's just a black screen for an hour and a half.
2997840	2998840	Yeah.
2998840	3001840	But your imagination goes wild.
3001840	3005840	Isn't Oliver Stone like the worst historian of all time?
3005840	3008840	I do believe he put a little too much on Jim Garrison's back in JFK.
3008840	3010840	He really did.
3010840	3013840	It's a very valuable one.
3013840	3018840	But he was very right about platoon because people only spoke in cliches.
3018840	3019840	That's why we lost.
3019840	3020840	Yes.
3020840	3021840	We were at war with our own language.
3021840	3028840	We were too busy writing grandma about grunts and calling people cheese dick.
3028840	3030840	Platoon.
3030840	3032840	And back then that was an insult.
3032840	3033840	Yeah.
3033840	3040840	So how is it that if they have that, why are they still like drone bombing weddings and
3040840	3042840	stuff in Afghanistan?
3042840	3045840	That was supposed to be rice.
3045840	3046840	Yeah.
3046840	3047840	This is the worst.
3047840	3048840	That was from Amazon.
3048840	3050840	That was an Amazon drone.
3050840	3052840	I know what you're talking about.
3052840	3055840	I put that on my wish list.
3055840	3056840	I don't know what I'm doing.
3056840	3057840	I'm like Robin Williams now.
3057840	3058840	Wish list Amazon.
3058840	3059840	Hashtag.
3059840	3063840	I'm just casting and fucking.
3063840	3065840	Hashtags and bacon.
3065840	3066840	Whoa.
3066840	3067840	That was pretty good.
3067840	3070840	That was a pretty good Robin Williams.
3070840	3073840	Hey, Mitch Hurwitz is Robin Williams.
3073840	3075840	What should I do tomorrow?
3075840	3077840	What's going on?
3077840	3079840	Everybody wonder why Barbara Bush.
3079840	3080840	I don't know.
3080840	3081840	You know what?
3081840	3082840	Take the day.
3082840	3083840	Take the day.
3083840	3084840	That's really good.
3084840	3085840	That's really good.
3085840	3086840	Before you said a single word that was like the most amazing impression.
3086840	3087840	Well, I got a little Irish and then I had that for you.
3087840	3090840	Outside of Goldthwaite's impression of Robin Williams, which is impeccable.
3090840	3093840	Well, they're like, they hang out every day for the last 40 years.
3093840	3094840	Yeah.
3094840	3095840	Oh, bobcat.
3095840	3096840	Yeah.
3096840	3097840	You can't tell the story.
3097840	3098840	Are you friends with Bobcat?
3098840	3100840	He has done Jeff's job here before when Jeff's been away.
3100840	3101840	He's controlled.
3101840	3103840	We actually had Bob and Robin on the same show here.
3103840	3104840	Yeah.
3104840	3105840	He brought, he brought Robin by.
3105840	3106840	Amazing.
3106840	3107840	Unexpectedly one night.
3107840	3108840	He's so funny.
3108840	3109840	He's so funny.
3109840	3110840	I remember him telling me.
3110840	3111840	Yeah.
3111840	3112840	Yeah.
3112840	3113840	Yeah.
3113840	3114840	Yeah.
3114840	3115840	Yeah.
3115840	3116840	Yeah.
3116840	3117840	Yeah.
3117840	3118840	Yeah.
3118840	3119840	Yeah.
3119840	3120840	Yeah.
3120840	3121840	Yeah.
3121840	3122840	Yeah.
3122840	3123840	Yeah.
3123840	3124840	Yeah.
3124840	3125840	Yeah.
3125840	3126840	Yeah.
3126840	3127840	Yeah.
3127840	3128840	Yeah.
3128840	3129840	Yeah.
3129840	3130840	Yeah.
3130840	3131840	Yeah.
3131840	3132840	That's funny.
3132840	3133840	I remember him telling me years ago, I haven't seen him in 100 years, but, but he had just
3133840	3134840	done, what was the clown?
3134840	3135840	Are we talking about Bob or Robinwood?
3135840	3136840	Go for it.
3136840	3137840	Shakes the clown.
3137840	3138840	And he had a LaWanda page.
3138840	3140840	Someone said, Oh, you guys thought it was Robin Williams.
3140840	3141840	Okay.
3141840	3142840	Not a patch.
3142840	3143840	Adam's.
3143840	3144840	They both did clown movies.
3144840	3145840	Yeah, they did.
3145840	3146840	Yeah.
3146840	3147840	Very different tones.
3147840	3148840	Yeah.
3148840	3153160	And the and LaWanda page he said, just, she had a line that was like, what are you doing
3153160	3154160	here?
3155160	3161160	I got that peanut butter pussy is smooth and brown and easy to spread.
3161160	3165160	And Bobcat said, okay, we have one that way.
3170160	3171160	I won Bobcat.
3171160	3173160	He is amazing.
3173160	3177160	And another hero of mine in terms of like, like, like realizing that was back in Milwaukee,
3177160	3178160	Bob.
3178160	3183360	Like I've told him when he came here, like Shrab and I, when we were in Milwaukee as just
3183360	3190960	virtual children, by today's standards, watching Bob do stand up and watching him kind of just
3190960	3191960	untethered.
3191960	3192960	Yeah.
3192960	3196880	And kind of not, you know, like he's on the audience's side, but he also kind of doesn't
3196880	3202240	doesn't even pander to his own audience on the audience's side, but but absolutely not
3202240	3207160	accountable to them at all, like on their side because he expects better of them.
3207160	3208160	Yeah.
3208160	3210800	And to the extent that they disappointed him, he let them know.
3210800	3211800	Yeah.
3212240	3216440	And it was it was it was really gratifying and liberating to watch the realization that
3216440	3221280	performance didn't always mean pandering.
3221280	3224800	You have equal amounts of epiphanies about how it actually is pandering.
3224800	3226120	What the fuck are you even doing this for?
3226120	3229480	If you're going to be a jaded piece of shit with lots of epiphanies in that area.
3229480	3234060	But there are a lot of people who set you free to along the way and send you the message
3234060	3238080	of holy shit, you need to do this for yourself because no one wants to watch you.
3238120	3242440	I worked with Chris Guest on something which, you know, another like such an important guy
3242440	3245200	in comedy and such like Bobcat.
3245200	3251160	And he he maintains that he does not care if his audience likes the show or likes his
3251160	3252160	movie.
3252160	3253160	Christopher Guest.
3253160	3254160	Christopher Guest.
3254160	3257280	And I would say to him, do you care if your wife likes it?
3257280	3258280	Yeah.
3258280	3260760	Do you care if Michael McKeon likes it?
3260760	3261760	Right.
3261760	3262760	Yes.
3262760	3263760	You're getting into an audience.
3263760	3264760	Right.
3264760	3265760	We got an audience situation ruined.
3265760	3266760	Yeah.
3267440	3268440	It's a communication.
3268440	3269440	There's no doubt about it.
3269440	3270680	You're doing it.
3270680	3272320	You're doing it for other people.
3272320	3273320	That's the weirdest.
3273320	3280760	That's the that's the inception top spinning of what would I draw on that as a metaphor.
3280760	3287640	But it spins between the poles of you.
3287640	3289360	They are the most important people in the world.
3289360	3293720	I'm pointing at the audience like there's some kind of horde of plebeians.
3293720	3295500	You do everything you do for them.
3295500	3299280	If you enter the vocation that has anything to do with making them happy, then you owe
3299280	3304040	it to yourself and owe it to them to wake up every morning and go, I would be I would
3304040	3306080	kill myself if they disappeared.
3306080	3310360	I would be like I would have no Winslow on my outcast island.
3310360	3312560	I do everything I do for other people.
3312560	3315720	I am a psychotic I lived to entertain.
3315720	3321120	But because I live to entertain, I also owe it to them whether they like it or not to
3321120	3326240	be myself and speak my mind because that's what they actually are entertained by because
3326240	3329720	believe it or not, they're human beings that have their own thing going on.
3329720	3334080	And when they do volunteer, as we sometimes do, to sit in a chair and watch somebody else,
3334080	3338360	they don't want to watch somebody who spent the day figuring out how to make them laugh.
3338360	3340800	Well, I think they want to watch somebody who's making themselves.
3340800	3343960	I think audiences and you know, we're audiences too.
3343960	3348400	But I think people are highly attuned to being manipulated, you know, and there's a certain
3348400	3350360	amount that they're willing to play along.
3350360	3353800	I think it's why kind of self referential stuff got really popular for a while because
3353800	3357680	suddenly we were doing everybody was doing things like product placement and things like
3357680	3358680	that.
3358680	3360360	You had to call yourself on it.
3360360	3361440	But even that's a trick.
3361440	3366680	You felt like you know, there's always you flipping the pancake if you leave it one side
3366680	3369560	down for too long, it starts to sizzle and burn.
3369560	3375240	And so, yeah, we're are we any more subversive than Jack Benny?
3375240	3376240	No, we're not.
3376240	3377240	Absolutely not.
3377240	3381480	Anyways, he was being more subversive than us, because at least he had the balls to stop
3381480	3384320	in the middle of his comedy routine and say, by the way, this is brought to you by a fucking
3384320	3387320	mob.
3387320	3392400	We so we don't actually gain any distance, we change, we rotate, we flip and we flop
3392400	3394760	and we flip and we flop.
3394760	3395760	What was my point?
3395760	3400680	He was Jack Benny in particular was so subversive in a way, because he really he called himself
3400680	3401680	on everything.
3401680	3405560	That whole show was artifice that also, you know, as soon as something would would embarrass
3405560	3409280	him, he'd kind of step away and he'd say, like, well, this is just a show.
3409280	3411760	I mean, it really, he deconstructed everything.
3411760	3412760	It's hilarious.
3412760	3413760	Yeah.
3413760	3418520	Like on satellite radio, when the classic channel, classic radio stuff with Jack Benny's
3418520	3420360	on, it's the greatest listening in the world.
3420360	3424640	All those guys, you know, it'll happen to us, too, they'll be, you know, in three generations
3424640	3426040	and say, oh, that's right, old stuff.
3426040	3427040	And then hopefully, it'll listen to it.
3427040	3428040	You bet your ass.
3428040	3429040	Yeah, if we're lucky.
3429040	3432520	You bet your ass they'll be talking about me in 30 years.
3432520	3433520	That's what I heard.
3433520	3435200	That's what I heard Mitch Hurwitz say.
3435200	3436200	That was the guy.
3436200	3438480	They'll be talking about me in 30 years.
3438480	3440080	I said that wrong.
3440080	3444000	I'm so sorry, guys.
3444000	3447840	The guy that actually got hung for hate crimes.
3447840	3449520	That guy.
3449520	3450520	You brought the gallows.
3450520	3452880	You know, he was a showrunner before all this crime.
3452880	3456160	What's the show?
3456160	3457160	What's the show?
3457160	3458160	I can't remember what it was called.
3458160	3459160	What's the show?
3459160	3460160	All right.
3460160	3461160	I don't want anybody up here to leave.
3461160	3464680	Nobody's leaving, even though it's going to get physically awkward and crowded because
3464680	3474360	I need to bring, first of all, Spencer Crittenden to the side stage, our dungeon master.
3474360	3481400	Hey, what's up?
3481400	3484280	Mitch, you have to stay and play Dungeons and Dragons with us.
3484280	3485280	Oh, okay.
3485280	3487200	That's your punishment.
3487200	3488200	What?
3488200	3490440	It's a little game you'll catch on.
3490440	3491440	Okay.
3491440	3492640	It's a super simple game.
3492640	3493640	Yeah.
3493640	3494640	Okay, great.
3495600	3496600	No.
3496600	3499880	And I mean, we're in like the final boss fight, like right in the middle of it.
3499880	3500880	That's okay.
3500880	3501880	Don't worry about it.
3501880	3502880	I'll just jump in.
3502880	3503880	Yeah.
3503880	3504880	I'll figure it out.
3504880	3505880	Yeah.
3505880	3506880	Don't worry about it.
3506880	3507880	I won't make a mockery of it.
3507880	3508880	No, no, just go.
3508880	3509880	No.
3509880	3510880	I mean, if you make a-
3510880	3511880	I'll totally figure it out.
3511880	3513400	If you made a mockery of it, that'd probably be the best way this could go.
3513400	3515200	If I made him, if I made him what?
3515200	3516800	No, if he made a mockery of it.
3516800	3517800	No, I won't.
3517800	3518800	I won't.
3518800	3519800	I'll figure it out.
3519800	3521880	I may say things like, oh, I've got the golden amulet.
3521880	3522880	I win.
3522880	3523880	Yeah.
3524120	3525120	No, that's what I'm saying.
3525120	3526120	That's what's going to work.
3526120	3527120	That's what's going to play well here.
3527120	3528120	I'm not going to say much.
3528120	3532600	I think regular Hormantown listeners will know how seriously we take this D&D game.
3532600	3533600	I have an idea.
3533600	3536320	I would like- I should play my Hawk Avenger.
3536320	3537320	Yeah.
3537320	3538320	I was thinking, yeah.
3538320	3539320	Okay.
3539320	3540320	Right.
3540320	3541320	By the way, can I say something?
3541320	3542320	My character is a hawk.
3542320	3543320	Okay.
3543320	3544320	I should play it.
3544320	3545320	Someone just tweeted this at me.
3545320	3546320	You'd be so good at it.
3546320	3547320	Yeah.
3547320	3549240	They tweeted it at us.
3549240	3553680	They said the D&D group has had a liar of building this whole time.
3553680	3557680	They said in episode 50, they found a liar of building in the treasure after killing
3557680	3558680	the dragon.
3558680	3563560	And they can basically build mines, tunnels, ditches.
3563560	3567720	The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 human-
3567720	3569120	It's like 100 human hours.
3569120	3570120	Yeah.
3570120	3571120	Laboring for three days.
3571120	3572120	I got it.
3572120	3573120	I got it.
3573120	3574120	Okay.
3574120	3575120	Let's do it.
3575120	3576120	Let's try it.
3576120	3577120	Let's give it a shot.
3578120	3581120	See, he's got it.
3581120	3582120	He's got it.
3582120	3583120	Mitch has got it.
3583120	3585120	What were you worried about, Spencer?
3585120	3586120	I'm telling you.
3586120	3587120	That's good.
3587120	3588120	Can we also play Erin McGathey?
3588120	3589120	Erin McGathey.
3589120	3590120	It's my girlfriend, Mitch.
3590120	3591120	No, Erin, you sit over here.
3591120	3592120	I'm going to stand up.
3592120	3593120	Oh.
3593120	3594120	Oh, okay.
3594120	3595120	Yeah.
3595120	3596120	Yeah.
3596120	3597120	Yeah.
3597120	3598120	Yeah.
3598120	3599120	Yeah.
3599120	3600120	Yeah.
3600120	3601120	Yeah.
3601120	3602120	Yeah.
3602120	3603120	Yeah.
3603120	3604120	Yeah.
3604120	3605120	Yeah.
3606120	3607120	Oh, okay.
3607120	3608120	Jack, everybody.
3608120	3609120	Exactly.
3609120	3610120	All right.
3610120	3611120	Hello.
3611120	3612120	How can I see you?
3612120	3613120	Okay.
3613120	3614120	Yeah, let's do this.
3614120	3615120	I'm sorry, guys.
3615120	3616120	What a tremendous support crew we have.
3616120	3619920	I almost called them a staff, but we don't pay them.
3619920	3620920	Can you-
3620920	3623320	May very briefly do something very selfish.
3623320	3624320	Yeah.
3624320	3625320	Yeah.
3625320	3626320	Yeah.
3626320	3627320	Mitch, my little brother is your biggest, biggest fan in the whole world.
3627320	3628320	No way.
3628320	3629320	He is.
3629320	3630920	Could you say hello to Michael McGathey real fast?
3630920	3631920	Michael McGathey.
3631920	3632920	McGat- McGathey.
3632920	3633920	Well-
3633920	3634920	Yeah.
3634920	3635920	Yeah.
3635920	3636920	I've been live tweet texting.
3636920	3637920	How old is he?
3637920	3641920	He is three years younger than I am.
3641920	3643920	Well, now you can't say.
3643920	3644920	He's 26.
3644920	3645920	He's 27.
3645920	3646920	Oh.
3646920	3648920	Well, hi, Michael.
3648920	3650760	Thanks for listening to Dan's show.
3650760	3652440	You didn't know I was going to be on it.
3652440	3653440	But thanks anyway.
3653440	3654440	Thank you.
3654440	3655920	You seem like a great little guy.
3655920	3660720	I feel like a- I feel like we're- since we have Robin Williams here, he should say hello
3660720	3661720	to everyone.
3661720	3662720	Oh, hello, Michael.
3663720	3664720	Oh.
3664720	3665720	What's the crazy ones?
3665720	3666720	Oh, the crazy ones.
3668720	3670720	Can you do me a favor too?
3670720	3674720	Can you tell Shabana Nangiani it's okay, I'm not a doctor?
3675720	3678720	But do it as Sean Connery.
3678720	3682720	Do it as Robin Williams again, because they know who Robin Williams is.
3682720	3683720	I'm going to do it.
3683720	3684720	I'll do it as Dan Harmon.
3684720	3685720	Okay.
3685720	3687720	I don't know if you've heard my Dan Harmon impression.
3687720	3688720	No, it's pretty good.
3689720	3691720	Hey, Shabana.
3693720	3695720	It's good that your son's not a doctor.
3695720	3696720	Wow.
3697720	3698720	Thanks.
3698720	3699720	Thank you.
3699720	3700720	Wow.
3700720	3701720	Thank you.
3701720	3702720	That was really close.
3702720	3703720	Yeah.
3703720	3705720	I also do- Michael, I also do your sister, Aaron.
3705720	3706720	Let me see if I can-
3711720	3712720	Oh.
3713720	3714720	Wow.
3714720	3715720	That wasn't nice.
3715720	3716720	I'm sorry.
3716720	3717720	I'm sorry.
3717720	3718720	I'm sorry.
3718720	3719720	She doesn't sound like that, Mitch.
3719720	3720720	Mitch.
3721720	3722720	All right.
3722720	3723720	So you're a hawk.
3723720	3724720	Will Aaron describe what she's wearing?
3724720	3728720	Because I think it's a propitious day to do so, right?
3729720	3730720	Oh, oh, oh.
3730720	3733720	Thank you, Mitch, for plugging my animated show.
3733720	3734720	Is that what you're doing?
3734720	3736720	And paying attention to my girlfriend?
3738720	3739720	Oh, that's the impression.
3739720	3740720	I feel like I have to-
3740720	3745720	In the celebration of the premiere of Rick and Morty, the best animated show I've ever
3745720	3746720	seen.
3746720	3747720	I've seen several episodes.
3747720	3748720	It's hilarious.
3748720	3752720	A sweatshirt featuring one of the main characters, Rick.
3753720	3754720	Yeah.
3755720	3756720	When does it premiere, Dan?
3756720	3757720	When does it air?
3757720	3758720	Tell us.
3758720	3761720	Rick and Morty airs tomorrow on Adult Swim, but it's been on YouTube the whole time.
3761720	3764720	But you should say the day of the week, because it's a podcast.
3764720	3765720	Well, this-
3765720	3766720	Oh, Monday.
3766720	3767720	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3767720	3768720	Well, probably tonight, if you're listening to this.
3768720	3770720	But the podcast will come out in a couple days, probably, right?
3770720	3771720	Or does it come out right away?
3771720	3773720	We're not going to really make those edits, right?
3773720	3774720	So tomorrow.
3775720	3776720	It'll be tomorrow.
3776720	3777720	So tonight?
3777720	3778720	Rick and Morty's on it.
3778720	3779720	Okay, got it.
3779720	3780720	But it's also been on YouTube for two weeks.
3780720	3781720	It's a new business model.
3781720	3782720	I'm just trying to help.
3783720	3786720	It's December 1st, 2013.
3786720	3787720	December 1st, 2013.
3787720	3790720	They put it on YouTube like two weeks ago.
3790720	3791720	Wow.
3791720	3792720	Not two weeks, like a week ago?
3792720	3793720	Really?
3793720	3794720	Yeah.
3794720	3796720	Well, I saw one hilarious little promo, but I didn't see the episode.
3796720	3797720	I didn't see one.
3797720	3798720	But it's been on YouTube.
3798720	3799720	I don't know what-
3799720	3800720	It's really funny.
3800720	3801720	And I say this without a hint of-
3801720	3802720	We don't get YouTube.
3802720	3803720	We don't get it.
3803720	3806720	I have no idea what they're thinking.
3806720	3808720	They're probably thinking wonderful things.
3808720	3809720	They're certainly the best network-
3809720	3810720	YouTube?
3811720	3812720	No.
3813720	3814720	Yeah.
3814720	3815720	I don't know.
3815720	3816720	I just a new-
3816720	3823720	I remember they put the pilot for community on Facebook a couple days before it aired
3823720	3824720	on NBC.
3824720	3827720	And I remember being young and naive enough to go, what?
3827720	3828720	But that means-
3828720	3829720	Yeah, right.
3829720	3834720	And I remember someone from NBC Digital basically saying, in your wildest dreams, so many people
3834720	3837720	would want to watch your shit that this would be a problem.
3837720	3838720	Right.
3838720	3839720	Right.
3839720	3840720	And that's the new attitude with-
3840720	3842720	Well, because all the TV, it's a long con.
3842720	3843720	You know what I mean?
3843720	3848720	You want to get 100 episodes until it's valuable for them, the people that really pay for them.
3848720	3852720	But at the same time, if they dump your shit online and then nobody watches, but I don't
3852720	3854720	think that's the reason nobody will watch.
3854720	3855720	I don't know.
3855720	3856720	They're really cute together, right?
3856720	3857720	We don't know anything.
3857720	3858720	Those numbers mean nothing.
3858720	3859720	I know.
3859720	3861720	Those numbers mean that someone's cat fell asleep on someone's arm.
3861720	3863720	Those numbers mean nothing.
3863720	3865720	They can't mean anything when they're that low.
3865720	3866720	No.
3866720	3872720	But even if you just had- Look, even if you just had 10 million viewers.
3872720	3875720	Like everything on basic cable.
3875720	3879720	Things get- Apparently, even shows like Girls get in the hundreds of thousands.
3879720	3884720	Yeah, Girls get- I know that it was like 600,000 or something, but it's a fantastic show.
3884720	3885720	It is great.
3885720	3888720	And I think it's the right 600,000 or whatever the number is.
3888720	3894720	Dan or Mitch, how would you feel about ratings if you guys were the number one rated show?
3894720	3896720	I don't think you mess with the system.
3896720	3897720	I think it works.
3897720	3903720	I mean, are we too quick to- Did anyone say that ratings- We're not sitting
3903720	3905720	up here saying that ratings are unimportant.
3905720	3906720	We're saying the opposite.
3906720	3911720	We're kind of lamenting our- We want a number that says that a billion people are watching
3911720	3912720	our show.
3912720	3914720	We're not going like- But after-
3914720	3918720	They gave it to MSN, which was then like a big portal like AOL.
3918720	3920720	It was just all the residents were on there for free.
3920720	3922720	They just gave it all away.
3922720	3924720	Anyway, maybe if everyone here- I just want to entertain-
3924720	3927720	I was going to say Nickel, but it's not that big of a crap.
3927720	3935720	If everybody chips in like 10 grand.
3935720	3940720	Can I tell a story real quick that has nothing to do with this, but it's sort of time appropriate?
3940720	3944720	Sure, as long as it's about time.
3944720	3946720	Because that's a good segue.
3946720	3947720	Wow, that was-
3947720	3949720	Time is passing and you're going to tell a time-related story.
3949720	3954720	By the way, I thought that thing about the reclusive magician was really great.
3954720	3955720	Oh, come on.
3955720	3958720	I was like, oh my God, that's fucking amazing.
3958720	3962720	It's just been a sad magician in a room like, ta-da.
3962720	3967720	No, see, the way I heard that was the best magician in the world who doesn't need the
3967720	3968720	feedback.
3968720	3969720	The challenger.
3969720	3970720	The challenger.
3970720	3971720	Exactly.
3971720	3972720	The trick is the point.
3972720	3973720	And he just can't fool himself.
3973720	3974720	He just can't do it.
3974720	3978720	I feel like Merlin and Gandalf are probably pretty reclusive, but those are people-
3978720	3979720	Those are wizards.
3979720	3981720	Yeah, but they're also in all those movies.
3981720	3982720	Yeah.
3982720	3984720	I think Merlin's pretty social.
3984720	3985720	What were you going to say?
3985720	3986720	What were you going to say, Camille?
3986720	3987720	I just thought-
3987720	3989720	You know, the other day I had a shoe.
3989720	3993720	I'm sorry, that wasn't fair of me to do that impression.
3993720	4003720	I was busting Dan with my impression of Dan jumping in.
4003720	4005720	I thought I would just-
4005720	4008720	The first time I was in America, I was like really little.
4008720	4013720	I was just visiting, and I landed in Queens where my uncle was.
4013720	4019720	And it was 6 a.m., and we couldn't sleep, and it just happened to be a Thursday morning.
4019720	4021720	And my uncle was like, here, I want to show you something.
4021720	4026720	My first day in America, and we went down, and he showed me the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
4026720	4032720	And I had no idea what Thanksgiving was, and I thought that's what happened every day.
4032720	4036720	I was like, we get up, and we fucking like, look at us go.
4036720	4038720	How old were you?
4038720	4039720	I don't remember.
4039720	4042720	I was probably not even like maybe nine or something.
4042720	4048720	Two young Pakistani eyes, did it look like they were like dragging animals and effigy down the street?
4048720	4051720	Did it look like, oh, they hate Kermit.
4051720	4055720	They hate Garfield.
4055720	4060720	I don't think they filtered everything through stock footage of terrorists.
4060720	4061720	I don't know.
4061720	4062720	He's waiting for Mussolini.
4062720	4064720	That's the spirit of the question, dude.
4064720	4069720	Oh, you know, this infidel Charlie Brown.
4069720	4077720	You know, I never used the word infidel until I came to America, because we were just us.
4077720	4090720	I think I've told the story, but at that exact age, even though I was born and raised where the miracles happen,
4090720	4094720	that didn't stop me from watching David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear.
4094720	4095720	Oh, yeah.
4095720	4101720	Did I tell the story on this podcast where I watched him make it disappear,
4101720	4105720	and they used to make such a to-do about things and broadcast TV back then,
4105720	4109720	that I turned off the TV and was like, huh, it's gone.
4109720	4113720	Hundreds of years of history.
4113720	4114720	How about that?
4114720	4117720	And I remember my aunt coming up going like, what's wrong?
4117720	4121720	And me going like, it's just David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear.
4121720	4122720	And she's like, oh, interesting.
4122720	4124720	And I was like, no, it's just, I mean, interesting?
4124720	4125720	Why is this?
4125720	4126720	It's fucked up.
4126720	4127720	The French gave it to us.
4127720	4129720	It's like 9-11.
4129720	4130720	You're a little honest.
4130720	4134720	It was like a peaceful 9-11.
4134720	4139720	It was stupid that he really made it disappear for real from the Earth
4139720	4144720	and was pontificating about whether or not that was right or wrong politically.
4144720	4147720	I like the idea of like Osama seeing that, also believing it,
4147720	4150720	and then trying to recruit him to like hang down.
4150720	4152720	My aunt was like, turn on the TV.
4152720	4154720	I think he probably brought it back.
4154720	4156720	No, I don't think so.
4156720	4162720	Dan, how did young you feel when the Harlem Globetrotters made it to Gilligan's Island?
4162720	4163720	Did they really make it there?
4163720	4164720	Well, yeah, they made it there.
4164720	4167720	Melark is buried there.
4167720	4173720	Deleted scene.
4173720	4174720	Sherwood Sports was the best.
4174720	4176720	Like Belushi, you know, on Martha's Vineyard.
4176720	4181720	People still go out to Burbank in Studio City and, you know, just try to find the grave.
4181720	4182720	Jim Belushi died?
4182720	4189720	No, not, oh.
4189720	4191720	That was part one of a three-part joke, but no one did the other two parts.
4192720	4195720	I think everyone did it in their head.
4195720	4198720	I've been in Jim Belushi's basement.
4198720	4200720	Let's play D&D.
4200720	4204720	Listen, the big story is that you're here to tell it.
4204720	4207720	I mean, there are very few people to add to there.
4207720	4210720	Yeah, how did you get out?
4210720	4214720	She's talking about the hipster breakfast place in Connecticut.
4214720	4217720	Jim Belushi's basement?
4217720	4220720	The host slaps you on the ass on the way in.
4220720	4221720	And you're like, that's so funny.
4221720	4224720	That's what they call the colon word at the...
4224720	4226720	Jim Belushi's basement.
4226720	4231720	Yeah, because he gave a lot of money to the colon rectal.
4231720	4232720	Mitch, you're a TV guy.
4232720	4233720	You've been around for a while.
4233720	4236720	I've heard a story that's...
4236720	4237720	Wait, no, wait.
4237720	4238720	We're interrupting a story about Jim Belushi.
4238720	4239720	Oh, I'm sorry.
4239720	4244720	I had a boyfriend who was friends with Jim Belushi's son.
4244720	4245720	Oh, is this in Chicago?
4245720	4246720	His son used to...
4246720	4249720	It's the same son, I'm guessing.
4249720	4250720	Okay.
4250720	4251720	Rob Belushi, I can say that.
4251720	4252720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4252720	4253720	That's fine.
4253720	4257720	You know, Mitch, that was very nice of you to point out that she was interrupted.
4257720	4261720	You're a really fantastic guy that's made a lot of quality television.
4261720	4262720	Thanks.
4262720	4267720	I like that you're interrupting her story to thank someone for stopping someone else from interrupting her story.
4267720	4270720	Camille, I like how diverse you are.
4270720	4271720	Thank you.
4271720	4274720	Hey, we're just putting the onus on the bonus, right?
4274720	4276720	And hey, Spencer.
4276720	4277720	Hey, guys.
4277720	4278720	Oh, hi, Spencer.
4278720	4279720	How are you?
4279720	4280720	Hi.
4280720	4281720	Okay.
4281720	4282720	Rob Belushi.
4282720	4283720	Very brief story.
4283720	4290720	I used to date somebody that was friends with Rob Belushi, and one day my ex-boyfriend took
4290720	4291720	me on an outing.
4291720	4294720	I didn't know where we were going, and the big reveal was that we were going to Jim Belushi's basement.
4294720	4297720	Did he, like, close your eyes and was like, ah!
4297720	4300720	Why are there Jim Belushi posters everywhere?
4300720	4301720	More or less.
4301720	4302720	More or less.
4302720	4304720	We'll say, and I don't think that this is, like, going...
4304720	4308720	Slightly newer Blues Brothers merchandise.
4308720	4313720	Why is it the highest concentration of Jim Belushi merchandise I've ever seen?
4313720	4316720	Why are there, according to Jim, box sets everywhere?
4316720	4322720	You guys are doing bits, but I don't think that Jim Belushi would mind me.
4322720	4328720	Well, I don't care what he would mind, but his basement, it's a bar, but it's covered
4328720	4333720	with pictures similar to an Irish bar, but it's just Jim Belushi shaking hands with different people.
4333720	4336720	And so the reveal was, he was like, do you know where you are?
4336720	4338720	And I was like, well, someone loves Jim Belushi.
4338720	4339720	Oh, I'm at Jim Belushi's house!
4339720	4342720	So that was the big thing.
4342720	4346720	All the people shaking hands with are people who constructed the room, though.
4346720	4348720	Good job on the crown molding.
4348720	4350720	This is the guy that gave me the Miller Life picture.
4350720	4352720	Thank you for moving this dartboard into here.
4352720	4353720	They just want to leave.
4353720	4355720	They just want to leave.
4357720	4359720	Oh, and a wall with a hundred telecosms.
4359720	4362720	This is the guy that sold me the DLP TV.
4362720	4364720	Man, this guy's really taking a pounding in this conversation.
4364720	4371720	But I heard a story that he pissed off his co-stars on Life According to Jim.
4371720	4372720	Is that what it's called?
4372720	4373720	According to Jim.
4373720	4376720	Everything According to Jim.
4376720	4378720	Jeff, it's According to Jim.
4378720	4379720	Sorry.
4379720	4381720	Don't get all Indian on me.
4384720	4389720	He didn't want to go off the set to go pee in the bathroom, which was just off the soundstage.
4389720	4396720	He took the pickle jar on the craft service table and took a piss in the pickle jar next to his female co-star.
4396720	4398720	That's a story I've heard.
4398720	4401720	But he must have been like, now am I a legend?
4401720	4404720	What is it going to take?
4404720	4407720	Does anyone know the name of his book?
4407720	4410720	It's called Piss it in the Pickles.
4410720	4414720	He has a book called Nuh-uh, M'lady, or something like that.
4414720	4421720	The cover of the book is a bicep tattoo with the title of the book on it, which is like, Real Men Don't Say I'm Sorry or something.
4421720	4423720	Yes, that's exactly the title.
4423720	4424720	What a great...
4424720	4427720	I don't own it.
4427720	4432720	Let it be known, I said nothing against Jim Belushi this entire time.
4432720	4433720	Is that an apology?
4433720	4435720	Because I know that Jim Belushi would look down on that.
4435720	4437720	That's not his thing.
4437720	4438720	You don't...
4438720	4441720	Real men don't say I'm sorry.
4441720	4442720	I'm not.
4442720	4444720	Mitch, that was amazing.
4444720	4445720	Mitch heard once.
4445720	4446720	That's all I want.
4446720	4449720	Real men will put their shirt back on.
4449720	4450720	He's a very...
4450720	4451720	I've met him a couple times.
4451720	4452720	A very, very nice guy.
4452720	4455720	Yeah, just so Shabani knows.
4455720	4458720	Shabani knows.
4458720	4460720	That was me...
4460720	4464720	Jim Belushi just shot this off.
4464720	4465720	And no one gasped.
4465720	4466720	Shabani...
4466720	4470720	Shabani just dropped from the rafters with a half mask on.
4470720	4471720	Hey, hey, hey.
4471720	4473720	That must have been why we were talking about him.
4473720	4475720	We saw him and we forgot.
4475720	4477720	He has haunted this comic book store.
4477720	4478720	I know.
4478720	4483720	That was actually Amazon drones delivering a demand with one red shoe.
4483720	4488720	The nerd meltdown used to be a cigar humidor.
4488720	4492720	And he's haunted it ever since it got turned into a comic book store.
4492720	4495720	What are all these picture books?
4495720	4497720	Spot on, Jim Belushi.
4497720	4499720	Why are none of these pictures of me?
4500720	4502720	I do like...
4502720	4505720	Mitch, have you got a Jim Belushi impression for us?
4505720	4507720	I've got a John Belushi impression.
4507720	4508720	It's not very good.
4508720	4509720	So, yes.
4510720	4511720	Oh my God!
4511720	4512720	Oh my God!
4512720	4513720	No, I don't.
4513720	4515720	I can't believe it's too easy.
4518720	4519720	Too easy.
4519720	4520720	And I don't...
4520720	4521720	That's funny.
4521720	4524720	I have no beef with a man.
4524720	4527720	Jim Belushi, get off the roof.
4528720	4530720	He's trying to get in.
4530720	4531720	Oh my God.
4531720	4533720	Somewhere Jim Belushi just looked around.
4533720	4535720	He felt that.
4535720	4541720	Mitch, did you write that a week ago and hope we would get here?
4541720	4542720	I regret it immediately.
4542720	4544720	Jim Belushi is in our electronic system.
4544720	4545720	I know.
4545720	4546720	He's like...
4546720	4548720	And in our hearts.
4550720	4551720	That was amazing.
4551720	4553720	Let's play some...
4553720	4556720	We're at a crucial point in our D&D campaign.
4557720	4558720	I won't get it.
4558720	4559720	I'll let you do it.
4559720	4562720	As a first-timer, I want you to treat yourself.
4562720	4565720	Spencer here is our Dungeon Master extraordinaire.
4565720	4569720	And he will catch us up to date where we are in the campaign.
4569720	4570720	Yeah.
4574720	4576720	What's up, you guys?
4579720	4580720	That's good to hear.
4581720	4587720	When we last met, our heroes were being assaulted by a mysterious metal mitt.
4587720	4590720	After pulling the head off their mortal enemy,
4590720	4595720	a massive arm burst through the floor, grabbing Quark and holding him fast.
4595720	4599720	As Mulrain worked to free the halfling, Sharpie quickly turned into gas.
4599720	4604720	The wizard seeped through the crack in the floor and saw the massive metallic golem
4605720	4610720	to which the arm belonged and flowed through his metal place and into his inner workings.
4610720	4614720	Then as Quark and Mulrain attacked the golem, Quark began...
4614720	4615720	I'm sorry.
4615720	4620720	Sharpie began punching a red glowing node that began emitting a glowing red heat.
4620720	4622720	And then I got pissed and left.
4628720	4629720	Spencer, point of order.
4629720	4630720	I'm not a halfling.
4630720	4631720	I'm a no.
4631720	4632720	Oh, shit.
4633720	4634720	Jeff, leave.
4634720	4638720	If I had something to turn in like a badge, I'd put it on the table.
4640720	4642720	Spencer, you got pissed off last time and left?
4642720	4643720	Yeah, yeah.
4643720	4645720	I mean, something like that.
4645720	4647720	It was a bit.
4647720	4649720	He's not allowed to say it was a bit.
4649720	4651720	How fun would that be?
4651720	4653720	No, I mean, I'd thought about doing it in the past,
4653720	4656720	but it worked best there in that circumstance.
4656720	4658720	But we sat here like thunderstruck.
4658720	4661720	Yeah, well, I couldn't be accountable for that at that point.
4661720	4662720	Yeah.
4663720	4666720	I could have saved the show, but I was offstage.
4666720	4671720	All right, so Spencer, draw for us a picture, remind everybody, and Mitch especially,
4671720	4673720	what we're looking at in the room that we're in right here.
4673720	4676720	Okay, so imagine you're on the second floor.
4676720	4677720	You're way higher than that.
4677720	4678720	You're up in a tower.
4678720	4681720	There's this arm coming in, and it's grabbing around.
4681720	4683720	It's just an arm.
4683720	4686720	And on the lower level, you got a big robot man,
4686720	4688720	and he's putting the arm up there.
4688720	4692720	And now, you are inside this robot.
4692720	4693720	Right.
4693720	4694720	And you guys...
4694720	4696720	No, Quark's on the top level.
4696720	4697720	Kumail's on the...
4697720	4700720	Christoperg's on the top level, and Mulrain's on the robot's shoulder.
4700720	4701720	Is that a true story?
4701720	4707720	Mitch Kumail's character is Christoperg, the guy that wrote Lady in Red.
4707720	4709720	He just told me that.
4709720	4711720	He was like, who's Christoperg?
4711720	4712720	Yeah.
4712720	4714720	Oh, well, so you've heard my work.
4714720	4715720	Big fan.
4715720	4716720	It's a great song.
4716720	4717720	Do you have ladies in any other colors?
4717720	4721720	I guess it's more important than previous episodes,
4721720	4725720	but if I'm gas and I went gaseously into the robot
4725720	4726720	and I'm punching...
4726720	4727720	Yeah.
4727720	4728720	Where's my hawk?
4728720	4729720	Yeah, that's a great question.
4729720	4730720	Avenger.
4730720	4732720	Can the hawk not vaporize?
4732720	4734720	I mean, it can.
4734720	4736720	It can be affected by spells that affect the user.
4736720	4737720	Oh, really?
4737720	4738720	So the hawk came with me?
4738720	4740720	Yeah, in theory.
4740720	4741720	All right.
4741720	4742720	I look around for Avenger.
4742720	4743720	Avenger!
4743720	4744720	That's you.
4744720	4745720	That's you.
4748720	4749720	Played by Robin Williams.
4749720	4751720	We never got this far in the podcast.
4753720	4755720	Yeah, right here, boss.
4756720	4757720	Oh, good. Thank you.
4757720	4758720	Yeah.
4758720	4759720	I was worried about you.
4759720	4760720	It just got a little gassy and I just...
4760720	4761720	But I'm here. I'm back.
4761720	4762720	Yeah.
4762720	4763720	Exactly.
4763720	4764720	Yeah.
4764720	4765720	All right.
4766720	4767720	I keep punching the...
4767720	4769720	I'm assuming this is the robot's heart
4769720	4773720	and I'm going to hit it and stab it and kick it and spit on it.
4774720	4777720	As you do all those things to the glowing red spot,
4777720	4778720	it begins to grow...
4778720	4781720	grow, glow brighter and hotter and brighter and hotter
4781720	4785720	as it burns you with a glowing hot energy.
4785720	4787720	Don't stop doing that.
4787720	4788720	You really?
4788720	4789720	Yeah. Don't do it.
4789720	4790720	Don't do it.
4790720	4791720	All right.
4791720	4792720	Because it's getting hotter.
4792720	4793720	It is.
4793720	4795720	You take three heat damage.
4795720	4796720	I take three heat damage.
4796720	4797720	Yeah, that's how hot it is.
4797720	4798720	All right.
4799720	4803720	I wish there was a way to leave like a grenade here
4803720	4805720	and just get out of here.
4805720	4806720	Well...
4807720	4809720	I have no grenades.
4810720	4811720	Do you...
4811720	4814720	I have a feeling I'm supposed to do something.
4814720	4816720	No, you're just a hawk.
4816720	4818720	I mean, anything that you can conceive of doing as a hawk.
4818720	4819720	Great.
4819720	4820720	Gas hawk.
4820720	4821720	Gas hawk.
4821720	4822720	Well...
4824720	4825720	We nest.
4826720	4828720	We have very good eyesight.
4828720	4830720	I noticed there's a ring on the finger.
4830720	4832720	Yeah, you could peck at things.
4832720	4834720	You could fly an attack with beak and talons.
4834720	4836720	Yeah, so you're inside this robe also,
4836720	4838720	looking around at all these weird glowing stuff.
4838720	4841720	But being a bird, you don't really get what it means.
4841720	4844720	Also, he doesn't have the brain of a non-hawk.
4844720	4846720	He doesn't have the brain of Mitch Hurwitz.
4846720	4849720	Well, even your character wouldn't really understand
4849720	4850720	the inside of a golem, you know?
4850720	4851720	Sure.
4851720	4852720	Well, fuck this thing.
4852720	4854720	I'm shocking grasping the heart.
4854720	4855720	Fine.
4855720	4856720	I'll take my heat damage,
4856720	4859720	but it's going to get some damage in response.
4859720	4862720	I'm defibrillatin' this MF.
4862720	4864720	But that's a good thing.
4864720	4865720	You don't want to do that.
4865720	4866720	Only if he's dead.
4866720	4867720	It's like a toggle.
4868720	4871720	You ever defibrillate a live person?
4871720	4872720	Smart.
4872720	4873720	Yeah.
4873720	4876720	You have the hawk seal of approval on that one.
4876720	4877720	Thank you.
4877720	4879720	It's like a toggle.
4880720	4882720	Can I ask you a question?
4882720	4883720	Please.
4883720	4886720	I know you can see really far, but up close...
4886720	4887720	I don't read a lot.
4887720	4888720	No.
4888720	4889720	I don't.
4890720	4891720	All right.
4891720	4893720	Shocking grasp on the heart.
4893720	4894720	Grasping the...
4894720	4897720	If you hold the book really far away, but then...
4897720	4898720	Do you know what I mean?
4898720	4899720	Then I'm circling and I'm trying to...
4899720	4901720	And I can't track the narrative.
4901720	4903720	I can't track the narrative.
4903720	4904720	You have a scream turn to pay.
4904720	4906720	You're far away.
4906720	4907720	You can't...
4907720	4910720	I've been reading the corrections for about seven years.
4910720	4911720	Of what?
4911720	4913720	I think as many people have...
4915720	4917720	You grab the heart thing.
4917720	4919720	It starts being electrified.
4919720	4921720	It takes 17 damage.
4923720	4925720	It's heart damage.
4925720	4928720	Can I ask, where is Admiral Darkstar at this point?
4928720	4931720	Well, his head got taken off and...
4931720	4933720	Yeah, you don't know where he went.
4933720	4935720	He kind of turned into gas also.
4935720	4937720	There's a lot of gas in it.
4937720	4939720	Am I being grasped upstairs by the arm?
4939720	4941720	No, you slipped out of its grasp.
4941720	4943720	Okay, I go into a barbarian rage.
4943720	4944720	Yeah, okay.
4944720	4946720	As I do, twice a day.
4946720	4952720	And I take my mighty greatsword and I try to chop off the arm and see if that severs any...
4952720	4957720	If robots bleed out of their arteries like mortal beings do.
4957720	4959720	This one doesn't.
4959720	4961720	Well, shit.
4961720	4965720	You cleave into its arm and it blinks off of its arm.
4966720	4969720	As if it didn't take any damage or get hurt in any way.
4971720	4973720	This sucks.
4973720	4975720	I say, ah-fooey.
4976720	4978720	In a rage.
4979720	4984720	I know this is going to be one of those things where it's like, oh, send the hawk down to make friends with it, but I...
4984720	4987720	No, we've tried to make friends every time with something and it always...
4987720	4988720	Okay.
4988720	4990720	We've put on shows for them.
4991720	4993720	And you're inside its chest with me.
4994720	4995720	Yeah.
4995720	4996720	Burning to death.
4996720	4998720	I'm in there with you.
4998720	5000720	And you're in a gaseous state, right?
5000720	5001720	We're not really gassed.
5001720	5002720	No, you guys are back.
5002720	5006720	We're re-solidified, but we're inside a robot's chest just hanging out.
5006720	5007720	So I'm upstairs.
5007720	5009720	Do we try to shaking its heart?
5009720	5010720	Shaking its heart?
5010720	5011720	I just...
5011720	5013720	I try to electrocute its heart.
5013720	5014720	Yeah.
5014720	5018720	If your hawk abilities, you could go flip for other vital organs.
5018720	5019720	Well, a hawk is...
5019720	5022720	Again, that sounds like I'm sacrificing myself, but hawks are very fatty birds.
5022720	5024720	And maybe we just cholesterol him.
5024720	5028720	You know, we just get those HDLs up, the LDLs.
5030720	5031720	I don't know if that's the word.
5031720	5034720	In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I will let him eat me.
5036720	5041720	Spencer, can I use my armlet of summer to ignite my fire armor?
5041720	5043720	Yeah, you're already on fire armor.
5043720	5044720	Okay.
5044720	5045720	Well, I thought so.
5045720	5046720	I was just making sure.
5046720	5051720	And I run up to his neck and I say, heads up.
5051720	5055720	And he'll wrap my fiery arms around his neck.
5055720	5058720	And then I call out for Avenger.
5058720	5059720	Avenger!
5059720	5060720	That's you.
5060720	5061720	Hey, hey!
5061720	5062720	Oh, I'm sorry.
5062720	5065720	I was just listening to some Christophergy.
5065720	5067720	And what do I do?
5067720	5069720	Avenger.
5069720	5072720	Fly into his neck and peck at his innards.
5072720	5074720	Well, I got to get out.
5074720	5075720	If you can.
5075720	5077720	If you can get out or fly up through his...
5077720	5078720	Okay.
5078720	5079720	While you're holding him, I'm going to do that.
5079720	5080720	I'm going to fly in.
5080720	5081720	So you can just go up to the head.
5081720	5082720	I'm around the outside.
5082720	5085720	I have my fiery arms around his neck.
5085720	5086720	And I'm trying to...
5086720	5087720	So I'm burning from the outside.
5087720	5097720	Maybe from the inside you can do like a reverse phone booth peck from birth on his neck.
5097720	5105720	And I go and I do an interesting sort of beak dance in his esophagus.
5105720	5109720	Your interesting set of beak dance, as you put it?
5109720	5112720	Yeah, is that in your thing anywhere?
5112720	5113720	Oh, yeah.
5113720	5117720	The thing you don't know is that I've read all the books and so like I know all these
5117720	5119720	extra things.
5119720	5121720	Yeah, you roll three die for that.
5121720	5123720	But I have talons.
5123720	5124720	I have talons.
5124720	5125720	I can scratch at it.
5125720	5127720	I can create some esophageal bleeding.
5127720	5129720	What is the DC on beak dance?
5129720	5133720	I mean, really like 26.
5133720	5135720	That's not a funny thing at all.
5135720	5137720	No, it's funny because you had an answer.
5138720	5144720	But yeah, the talons not so hot against metal as it happens.
5144720	5145720	Right.
5145720	5146720	But my armor?
5146720	5147720	Yeah, it heats it up.
5147720	5150720	But it doesn't do much more than that.
5150720	5152720	So it's hot now.
5152720	5153720	Okay.
5153720	5158720	So where I am, I'm just watching all this happen?
5158720	5159720	I guess.
5159720	5164720	And I have no way to get into any weak parts of the robot from where I am.
5164720	5166720	I mean, not where you know of.
5166720	5170720	You're up on the second floor with a hand with quark.
5170720	5172720	Oh, on the hand still.
5172720	5173720	Yeah.
5173720	5175720	You're above the other guys.
5175720	5176720	Okay.
5176720	5186720	Well, but I tell me, can I use a bowler to snare the hand and render it immobile?
5186720	5188720	You can definitely try.
5188720	5189720	What do you guys think?
5189720	5190720	Is that a fun?
5190720	5193720	You're going to stare at the finger, tie it to something or just tie its fingers together
5193720	5194720	and do it.
5194720	5195720	Yeah.
5195720	5196720	Tie it.
5196720	5197720	That's it.
5197720	5201720	But I mean, I'm sort of a rope based combatant.
5201720	5203720	So I really want to work this in.
5203720	5205720	So I take the bowler.
5205720	5207720	Is there no way?
5207720	5209720	It wouldn't fit around the arm probably.
5209720	5210720	Oh, okay.
5210720	5214720	Is there anybody have any magnetism or anything like that?
5214720	5215720	I have a bowler.
5215720	5217720	There's an electrical system we could disrupt.
5217720	5222720	I'm very charismatic.
5222720	5224720	You have your arms around his neck.
5224720	5226720	I think that ship has sailed.
5226720	5229720	Can I try using my talents together?
5229720	5230720	There's some kind of wiring.
5230720	5231720	There must be some kind of trouble.
5231720	5232720	There aren't actually any wires.
5232720	5233720	There aren't wires?
5233720	5234720	No.
5234720	5235720	See, you tried that last week, Dan.
5235720	5236720	So this is the six.
5236720	5237720	I was drunk.
5237720	5238720	Yeah.
5238720	5241720	Do we know who has the lyre of building?
5241720	5242720	Okay.
5242720	5244720	Well, guess what, buddy?
5244720	5245720	Yeah.
5245720	5248720	Let me know when it's my turn because I just found it.
5248720	5250720	I just found it.
5250720	5253720	I think it's Kumail's turn, but if he doesn't want to do anything...
5253720	5254720	Who has the lyre of building?
5254720	5256720	Is that a thing that's useful?
5256720	5258720	If no one knows, I'll say it's you.
5258720	5259720	Me?
5259720	5260720	Yeah.
5260720	5267720	So can I just build a building under the robot and just fucking...
5267720	5271720	Just fucking grow a building through his whole fucking body.
5271720	5272720	Maybe like an obelisk.
5272720	5275720	It'd take like a long, long time.
5275720	5276720	How long?
5276720	5278720	Like a half hour.
5278720	5285720	No, but with some of these lyre buildings, it's like a thousand human hours.
5285720	5286720	So you're saving.
5286720	5288720	Yeah, I don't know if you took that into account.
5288720	5291720	I don't know if you heard that part.
5291720	5294720	It's definitely a wondrous construction.
5294720	5295720	Okay.
5295720	5296720	Well, you know what?
5296720	5299720	Dan, I mean, I got a little...
5299720	5301720	Sharpie, go for it.
5301720	5302720	I'd like to give a try.
5302720	5306720	Sharpie.
5306720	5307720	Quick question.
5307720	5311720	This is like Clarence Darrow closing an argument.
5311720	5317720	Would you say this item that I'm standing in front of is his heart?
5317720	5319720	No, it's a golem.
5319720	5320720	It's not like his heart.
5320720	5321720	No, but I'm saying I'm...
5321720	5323720	I like how you're already backtracking.
5323720	5324720	I'm inside.
5324720	5325720	I'm inside of it.
5325720	5326720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5326720	5331720	I'm saying like, would you say that this item that I'm standing in front of is his heart?
5331720	5334720	No.
5335720	5338720	This big red thing that's like burning me.
5338720	5344720	Using your knowledge, Arcana, you determine it to be some sort of heat emission weapon device.
5344720	5347720	Not a heart.
5347720	5349720	So you're saying this item isn't a heart?
5349720	5352720	No, it's more of a heat emission sort of weapon.
5352720	5354720	So you admit it's an item.
5354720	5357720	I shrink item.
5357720	5360720	Oh, nice.
5360720	5361720	Wow.
5361720	5364720	Item shrinks to one sixteenth normal size.
5364720	5365720	Clarence Darrow.
5365720	5367720	It sure does.
5367720	5369720	As you wave your arms about.
5369720	5372720	Conjurous minimus.
5372720	5375720	And speak the magical catchphrase.
5375720	5380720	Before your very eyes, the heat emission object dwindles in size.
5380720	5383720	It dwindles and dwindles and dwindles to about.
5383720	5385720	One sixteenth.
5385720	5389720	One sixteenth of its original size.
5389720	5397720	It begins glowing brightly and emits the heat of maybe a toaster or something non-lethal.
5397720	5404720	I turn to Avenger and I'm like, let's make some toast.
5404720	5410720	Let's eat a little something and then we'll celebrate.
5410720	5412720	Avenger, I loved Arrested Development.
5412720	5415720	Oh, that's so nice. Thank you.
5415720	5423720	I was cut from the pilot, but I was circling the boat in the first scene.
5423720	5425720	Wait, does that kill the robot?
5425720	5426720	Nope.
5426720	5430720	Because it's not his heart.
5430720	5432720	But it's an item.
5432720	5433720	That was really good.
5433720	5436720	Yeah, definitely.
5436720	5440720	Spencer, I want to do a power attack at his wrist and pour water into it and see it.
5440720	5441720	No, it's not electric.
5441720	5442720	It's not electrical.
5442720	5443720	There's no wires.
5443720	5444720	It's magic.
5444720	5445720	It's golem.
5445720	5446720	Shit.
5446720	5447720	It's a golem.
5447720	5448720	Okay, I tried this.
5448720	5453720	Is the arm coming through a hole that just fits its arm or is there space around the
5453720	5454720	hole?
5454720	5455720	No, there's space.
5455720	5462720	Okay, I try to stick my great sword into it and slide down his wrist like Douglas Fairbanks
5462720	5463720	down a sail.
5463720	5464720	Yeah.
5464720	5465720	All right.
5465720	5467720	Down the road, as they say.
5467720	5468720	Okay.
5468720	5469720	I didn't know that.
5469720	5470720	What did he call it?
5470720	5471720	Thank you.
5471720	5472720	Down the road?
5472720	5475720	Down the road is what that's called?
5475720	5476720	Yeah.
5476720	5477720	It's a cutting reference.
5477720	5478720	Oh, it's a suicide.
5478720	5479720	What did the front row say?
5479720	5480720	It's a suicide joke.
5480720	5481720	No, not suicide.
5481720	5484720	Well, I guess if you're going down the road, it is suicide.
5484720	5489720	I mean, look, I didn't know that, but half of our audience did.
5489720	5491720	We have a lot of...
5491720	5493720	No one is surprised at that.
5493720	5494720	It's the Tumblr generation.
5494720	5497720	Do we need to do a sound effect where we all gasp?
5497720	5498720	Yeah.
5498720	5501720	Oh my God, Spencer's showing us.
5502720	5503720	All right.
5503720	5507720	I tried to go down the road, man.
5507720	5512720	You do this as you say it.
5512720	5513720	It does some damage.
5513720	5514720	Let's see here.
5514720	5516720	Am I sliding down his wrist?
5516720	5517720	Oh, yeah.
5517720	5522720	It's breaking your fall as you're cutting it open like a can of meat.
5522720	5524720	Does meat come in a can?
5524720	5525720	Sometimes.
5525720	5526720	Spam.
5526720	5527720	Spam.
5527720	5528720	Corn.
5528720	5529720	Beef.
5529720	5530720	Spam's not really.
5530720	5534720	It's not the first example I would come up with when I was coming up with stuff that's
5534720	5536720	in a can, but meat works.
5536720	5539720	Yeah, yeah, you know, meat in a can.
5539720	5540720	So you do that.
5540720	5541720	It does...
5541720	5542720	What was that?
5542720	5543720	Fifteens.
5543720	5545720	Eighteen damage.
5545720	5546720	All right.
5546720	5551720	And you find yourself, you know, halfway down its arm.
5551720	5553720	Am I down at the lower level now?
5553720	5554720	Definitely there.
5554720	5556720	I'm just going to suspend it around his ulna or what?
5556720	5557720	Yeah, his ulna.
5557720	5558720	All right.
5559720	5563720	It does eighteen damage to a thing with one sixteenth its heart.
5563720	5565720	It's not a heart.
5565720	5567720	It's a heat emission device.
5567720	5572720	It's a hot thing that powers it in its chest.
5572720	5573720	Does it power it?
5573720	5576720	No, it's a weapon emission.
5576720	5578720	It's just a defense mechanism.
5578720	5579720	Yeah.
5579720	5583720	From two floors up I yell, it's not his fucking heart!
5588720	5592720	And then I feel immediately bad.
5592720	5597720	I go back, I'm doing God's work in here!
5597720	5600720	I don't care how long it takes!
5602720	5603720	The monster shifts.
5603720	5604720	It's not a monster.
5604720	5606720	It's a fucking whatever.
5606720	5610720	The automaton shifts as its shoulder is now being occupied.
5610720	5613720	It tries to extricate its arm, but it can't seem to get it.
5613720	5616720	It's all messed up from being all sliced open and whatnots.
5616720	5618720	And from me shrinking its red thing.
5618720	5619720	No.
5619720	5620720	No.
5620720	5621720	It's not a heart.
5621720	5622720	I'll just let you.
5622720	5624720	Yeah, I mean, sure.
5626720	5629720	Avenger, I feel like what I did was important.
5629720	5637720	You know, so much of this is felted through a bird's eyes, but it's, to me, I really, I respected it.
5637720	5642720	And I chose you as a familiar because I feel like everything you've done is important too.
5642720	5644720	I haven't done much.
5645720	5646720	I've done some circling.
5646720	5648720	I made some comments about a beak dance.
5648720	5649720	That got some...
5649720	5651720	You underplay it.
5651720	5653720	You inspire me.
5654720	5655720	Well, then, fuck it.
5655720	5658720	Why do we want to hurt this thing?
5658720	5659720	I mean...
5659720	5660720	This robot?
5660720	5661720	Yeah, we do.
5661720	5662720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5662720	5663720	We gotta hurt the robot.
5663720	5664720	I say dumb things.
5664720	5665720	I say dumb things.
5666720	5669720	Robots fight flailing around.
5669720	5671720	It's swatting at you guys, but it's missing.
5671720	5672720	It's not hitting you.
5672720	5673720	Nice.
5673720	5674720	Yeah.
5674720	5675720	All right.
5675720	5678720	I'm still by his neck, right?
5678720	5679720	Yep.
5679720	5680720	Okay.
5680720	5681720	Huggin' it.
5681720	5682720	Huggin' it.
5682720	5683720	I'm going to use...
5683720	5686720	I'm going to release the heat.
5686720	5688720	So to speak.
5688720	5691720	Also, the name of my WWE wrestling character.
5691720	5694720	I'm gonna release the heat.
5694720	5700720	And I'm going to use my very high diplomacy.
5700720	5703720	And I'm going to say, hey!
5704720	5706720	Shut down!
5709720	5710720	Huh?
5711720	5713720	Do you need to roll dice for that?
5713720	5714720	Yeah, no.
5714720	5718720	I'm gonna file this under W for a worth of shot.
5719720	5723720	Yeah, they dropped Siri from these things a couple of weeks ago.
5723720	5724720	So they don't...
5724720	5726720	Tell them to shut down.
5726720	5727720	I'll add...
5728720	5731720	There is a mix-up.
5732720	5736720	We talked to your master, and they...
5737720	5740720	You're actually the welcoming committee.
5740720	5742720	All is forgiven.
5743720	5745720	Yeah, we forgive you.
5745720	5746720	Yeah.
5747720	5748720	It's cool.
5748720	5749720	It's totally fine.
5749720	5753720	We placated you for a little while because we know this is what you do
5753720	5757720	when we don't want to insult your strength or your mechanism.
5757720	5761720	And while she's taking me with my sword in its elbow, I go, yeah, we forgive you.
5761720	5764720	Test successful. Test successful.
5764720	5771720	So if you could just lower us down and show us the way out of here, that would be all great.
5771720	5776720	I start thinking lady in red, just to be like, hey, this sounds familiar, right?
5776720	5779720	Resume blowjob mode.
5780720	5782720	As per your ordinary protocol.
5783720	5786720	Which is what we know you were designed for originally.
5786720	5787720	Just based on your lips.
5787720	5788720	It's based on that architecture.
5788720	5791720	Based on the DSLs, yeah.
5792720	5797720	And really quick with my craft kit, I make a God's eye, and I present it.
5797720	5803720	Yeah, and I say, hey, we shrunk one of your items, but now you're making one of my items grow.
5807720	5810720	And I kind of just look at it for a while, like, anything?
5810720	5820720	And that's, I mean, I know Chris, whatever, D'Bergie isn't the sexiest man in America right now, but it has an effect.
5820720	5822720	Imagine that Camille said that word.
5822720	5829720	If your children have any bara bat mitzvahs coming up, I'm sure he would be totally willing to perform at them.
5829720	5830720	So what is...
5830720	5831720	Sorry, everybody.
5831720	5832720	How is...
5832720	5833720	Yeah.
5833720	5834720	How is the...
5834720	5835720	Come on, Spencer, play D&D with us.
5835720	5837720	Yeah, can you roll the dice?
5837720	5838720	How's Gollum?
5838720	5839720	How's his robot?
5839720	5840720	I can't respond to all this.
5840720	5841720	You kept track of others.
5841720	5843720	Come on, we told you what we did.
5848720	5850720	Now tell us what he does.
5851720	5854720	The hard facts are that I have very high diplomacy.
5854720	5855720	Hard facts.
5858720	5860720	These are the hard facts, gentlemen.
5863720	5865720	These facts don't lie.
5866720	5868720	Does that mean something different than I think it means?
5868720	5869720	No.
5869720	5870720	Okay.
5870720	5871720	No, no.
5871720	5872720	I'm supporting you.
5872720	5874720	I think it means, you know, we'll perform at your conference, but...
5874720	5879720	While this happens, my sword that's in his arm at a horizontal...
5879720	5880720	Oh, God.
5880720	5881720	That's all right.
5881720	5882720	That's just my dad.
5882720	5883720	It's just...
5884720	5886720	I thought it was still Jim Balicious coming.
5886720	5887720	Jim Balicious coming.
5889720	5893720	It was him trying to do his brother's karate character in the back.
5893720	5897720	As this is happening, I'm sitting on my sword like a little bird perch.
5897720	5898720	He goes to the killer bee and he says...
5898720	5899720	Yeah.
5900720	5902720	He's like, well, I'll practice, and then I'll show them.
5904720	5907720	Just to add to it, I'm sitting on my sword like a little bird perch,
5907720	5910720	and I take out my loot of charming, and I play that, because it's a charm thing as well.
5910720	5911720	Okay.
5911720	5912720	All right.
5912720	5916720	And I take out my ribbon dagger, and I hold a knife in my hand,
5916720	5919720	and I kind of do like a twirling ribbon dance, you know?
5919720	5921720	Like, it looks beautiful.
5921720	5923720	I do it great.
5923720	5926720	You know, and I get out a little typewriter,
5926720	5929720	and I start writing something, and this is what I write.
5930720	5931720	Day three.
5933720	5935720	What's up with rice?
5937720	5938720	That's not beans.
5940720	5941720	All right.
5941720	5942720	The pantry chronicles.
5942720	5944720	Why don't you start with day three?
5945720	5947720	You had just taken it out.
5947720	5950720	It's in media's residue, however you say it.
5950720	5953720	I don't have to tell you when I start my journal.
5953720	5956720	Anyway, deep within the hero's heart,
5956720	5961720	they must have realized that somehow this wouldn't be effective in any way.
5965720	5966720	Got excited.
5969720	5971720	However...
5977720	5978720	Go on.
5979720	5981720	Because it's Thanksgiving.
5984720	5989720	Just as there's not normally a Hong Kong phooey on Macy's Street.
5994720	5996720	That was the end of your pronouncement?
5996720	5997720	Yeah, nothing happened.
5997720	5998720	All right, fine.
5998720	5999720	Okay, all right, we're going.
5999720	6000720	We'll show you.
6000720	6001720	We were sitting and talking.
6001720	6005720	I do everything by the book, okay?
6005720	6009720	My character does everything by the book for the rest of his life.
6009720	6013720	Every child he has, he's got a certain amount of hit dice,
6013720	6016720	and he does everything just normally by the numbers.
6016720	6017720	Wait a minute.
6017720	6018720	So, Spencer... I'm sorry.
6018720	6021720	He does everything by the book.
6022720	6023720	Avenger?
6023720	6024720	I was hoping somebody would...
6028720	6029720	Then the book...
6029720	6030720	Then write down...
6030720	6033720	Then the book could do everything by...
6033720	6039720	I take out the blood book, the blood book.
6039720	6041720	My blood book of blood spells.
6041720	6042720	Okay.
6042720	6044720	But this doesn't have blood in it.
6044720	6046720	It's not a heart.
6047720	6048720	So why would the blood book...
6048720	6050720	That's why it doesn't have blood.
6050720	6051720	I cut myself.
6051720	6052720	I cut myself.
6052720	6054720	You cut yourself.
6055720	6058720	I pour blood onto where I'm standing.
6058720	6059720	Is there a shelf near the...
6059720	6061720	Well, that's interesting, because you would think there's electronics.
6061720	6062720	I keep thinking water.
6062720	6063720	I keep thinking...
6063720	6064720	But there's no electronics.
6064720	6065720	It's not electronic.
6065720	6066720	It's a golem.
6066720	6067720	It's made of magic.
6067720	6068720	It's a golem.
6068720	6069720	But I know that...
6069720	6070720	And I start...
6070720	6071720	I flip through the blood book, and I'm just...
6071720	6072720	I'm just...
6072720	6073720	I'm just randomly...
6073720	6075720	I'm hoping there's going to be a thing that'll turn my blood into something so big that
6075720	6077720	it'll explode the golem from the inside.
6077720	6080720	Sort of what I try to do with the building, but you shut me down.
6082720	6083720	All right.
6083720	6084720	That's not going to work.
6084720	6085720	All right.
6085720	6086720	I'm sorry.
6086720	6087720	Sharpie, look inside.
6087720	6089720	Is there any sort of mechanism or any sort of sinews or things that look vital that we
6089720	6090720	could...
6090720	6092720	I examine my surroundings.
6093720	6096720	It's been a long time since that's happened.
6097720	6099720	You had to roll the dice?
6099720	6100720	I mean...
6100720	6101720	What?
6101720	6102720	I examine my surroundings.
6102720	6103720	It's a perception check, man.
6103720	6104720	You've got to see how much you've seen.
6104720	6105720	I examine all of them.
6107720	6108720	Okay.
6108720	6110720	Yeah, so you examine your surroundings.
6110720	6113720	You see several glowing things.
6113720	6115720	Three of them are green.
6115720	6116720	Two of them are yellow.
6116720	6119720	You also see two holes below you.
6119720	6121720	What about those glowing things?
6121720	6123720	That's going to be the key to something, right, guys?
6123720	6126720	I'm interested in those two holes below them.
6127720	6129720	One of them was my daughter.
6135720	6136720	So that's happening.
6137720	6139720	Are the glowing things like glowing balls?
6139720	6140720	Can I get up to them?
6140720	6141720	You can't.
6141720	6142720	You're outside.
6142720	6143720	You're not in here.
6143720	6144720	Yeah.
6144720	6145720	All right, they're inside.
6145720	6146720	To the holes.
6146720	6147720	Yeah, on the inside.
6147720	6148720	To the holes.
6148720	6149720	Let's go in the holes.
6149720	6150720	We're going to the holes.
6150720	6151720	I hope this is not a meatus.
6151720	6152720	How big are the holes?
6152720	6153720	They're man-sized.
6153720	6154720	Man-sized?
6154720	6155720	Sure.
6155720	6156720	Like we can fit in them?
6156720	6157720	Yeah.
6157720	6158720	Avenger.
6158720	6159720	They've got to be the legs.
6159720	6163720	Guys, you're just going into the feet.
6163720	6164720	Nice.
6164720	6167720	Well, I mean, you say it like that.
6167720	6169720	I mean, this is...
6169720	6171720	A second ago, we were inviting people...
6171720	6174720	No, you said there was two green, two yellow, and they just got...
6174720	6176720	Three green, two yellow.
6176720	6177720	Three green, two yellow.
6177720	6178720	Yeah.
6178720	6179720	Figure out the pattern there.
6179720	6180720	Are there holes on the outside?
6180720	6181720	No.
6181720	6182720	Three green, two yellow.
6182720	6183720	It's something.
6183720	6184720	No, that's a mislead.
6184720	6185720	Yeah.
6185720	6186720	It's not anatomical.
6186720	6187720	That saved you the trouble.
6187720	6188720	It's not like...
6188720	6189720	They're not...
6189720	6191720	There's not like two legs that are the size of a dude.
6191720	6193720	Says the heart guy.
6193720	6197720	But they must go somewhere.
6197720	6199720	I mean, I could explore.
6199720	6200720	Avenger, you...
6200720	6201720	You could go in and look around.
6201720	6202720	Look around, thank you.
6202720	6203720	And I'll go down the other one.
6203720	6204720	Let's go.
6204720	6205720	High five before we go.
6205720	6206720	Okay.
6207720	6209720	Avenger, I love your work.
6209720	6215720	You guys jump down the holes, and what you see is really strange.
6215720	6221720	You see a glowing stone floating in mid-foot.
6221720	6222720	Are we both together again?
6222720	6223720	No.
6223720	6224720	So that's got to be a power...
6224720	6226720	You know, we both see glowing stones.
6226720	6227720	Yeah.
6227720	6230720	So this has got to be the power source of this thing.
6230720	6233720	I feel like it should be someone else's turn unless we want to keep going.
6233720	6234720	It's Chris's turn, right?
6234720	6235720	Yeah, yeah.
6235720	6236720	Okay.
6236720	6238720	Well, I'm outside of all this.
6238720	6240720	I have no idea what's going on, right?
6240720	6241720	Yeah.
6241720	6242720	Can I take my wire saw?
6242720	6243720	Yeah.
6243720	6245720	I'm in the feet.
6245720	6248720	Easy with the saw.
6248720	6252720	Can I get down to the feet from where I am?
6252720	6253720	No.
6253720	6254720	It would take you...
6254720	6255720	A turn?
6255720	6256720	Yeah.
6256720	6258720	Well, what can I reach of the robot where I am?
6258720	6261720	You could get down to his shoulder, I think, or maybe his torso.
6261720	6265720	I just go and I dip the saw in the acid.
6265720	6267720	I have five vials of acid.
6267720	6270720	And I just pour all of them on there, on the wire saw.
6270720	6271720	Uh-huh.
6271720	6273720	Hopefully they don't dissolve the saw itself.
6273720	6274720	Yeah.
6274720	6276720	And they don't.
6276720	6277720	If they don't.
6277720	6279720	I feel like that's what happens.
6279720	6280720	Okay, all right.
6280720	6282720	Well, I go, oh, no, no, no, no, take back.
6282720	6283720	Take back.
6283720	6284720	He still has the handle.
6284720	6287720	I have the handle.
6288720	6290720	I was thinking of Merck's Brothers.
6296720	6297720	Is the robot a poise...
6297720	6298720	Can I use any of the poise?
6298720	6299720	Blue cap?
6299720	6300720	Nah, not on our robot.
6300720	6301720	All right.
6301720	6304720	Well, I just go down there and I start sawing at the neck of the...
6304720	6305720	Nice.
6308720	6309720	I jump out of the way.
6309720	6315720	Your blade bites deeply into the metal and you continue to saw vigorously.
6316720	6317720	You know, it'll take some time.
6317720	6318720	It's sawing.
6318720	6322720	Is it going to take longer than making a fucking building would have?
6322720	6324720	No, not quite as long.
6324720	6325720	Okay.
6325720	6326720	Whose turn is it?
6326720	6327720	Yours.
6327720	6328720	About me?
6328720	6329720	Maureen.
6329720	6330720	We'll go this way.
6330720	6331720	Okay, great.
6331720	6332720	Okay.
6332720	6337720	Well, I am going to...
6337720	6341720	Can I jump into his face down to where the glowing things are?
6341720	6343720	Like, can I jump into his mouth?
6343720	6344720	Into his mouth?
6344720	6346720	No, it doesn't really have a proper mouth.
6347720	6348720	All right.
6348720	6349720	I don't know why that's funny.
6349720	6350720	Okay.
6350720	6351720	All right.
6351720	6352720	Well, then I'm going to...
6352720	6355720	I'm going to help Chris saw.
6355720	6356720	Will that speed it up?
6356720	6357720	Yeah, definitely.
6357720	6358720	All right.
6358720	6360720	Hey, I gotcha.
6360720	6361720	Oh, cool.
6363720	6367720	You know, I almost dissolved my own saw with these assets.
6367720	6369720	What a maroon.
6369720	6372720	Now, does the column have a head, this robot thing?
6372720	6373720	Yeah, definitely.
6373720	6375720	So we're trying to start...
6375720	6380720	I go onto the other side and do a flaming sword power attack
6380720	6382720	and try to chop his head from the other side.
6382720	6383720	All right.
6384720	6385720	Oh.
6385720	6386720	Fuck.
6386720	6387720	Oh.
6387720	6388720	You critically hit.
6395720	6398720	It deals 26 damage.
6399720	6402720	You guys are wailing on it from both sides.
6402720	6405720	It's got maybe a third of its neck left at this point.
6405720	6406720	Yeah.
6408720	6410720	Mitch, you having a good time?
6410720	6411720	Yeah.
6411720	6412720	I feel like...
6412720	6414720	I'm glad the sawing is stopping,
6414720	6417720	because that's been annoying, that sound.
6417720	6418720	We're almost...
6418720	6419720	We're almost...
6419720	6421720	We're almost done with the sawing.
6423720	6424720	You guys go.
6424720	6425720	All right.
6425720	6426720	So I got a gem in front of me?
6426720	6427720	Yeah.
6427720	6428720	I combined the gems.
6429720	6432720	I mean, obviously, I'm the interloper here.
6432720	6433720	I don't...
6433720	6434720	I don't really think we're in the same place.
6434720	6435720	You got a gem.
6435720	6436720	I got a gem.
6436720	6438720	We both went down two different holes,
6438720	6440720	and we're standing in front of two different gems.
6440720	6441720	There's a reason these gems are not separate.
6441720	6444720	Can I cast Shrink Item again?
6444720	6445720	Uh...
6445720	6446720	Yes.
6447720	6449720	You're just making the thing that...
6449720	6450720	Oh, on the jewel.
6450720	6451720	Yeah, now it's...
6451720	6453720	Hey, man, however many hearts this thing has...
6453720	6459720	I open my mouth, and I don't say anything.
6459720	6461720	And I just nod.
6462720	6465720	Minimus, itemus?
6465720	6469720	That's a different magical phrase than the last time.
6469720	6472720	I'm like Lou Diamond Phillips in La Bamba.
6472720	6474720	I don't sing it the same way.
6474720	6476720	It's not part of my people.
6476720	6477720	Oh, then it works.
6480720	6481720	That...
6482720	6483720	Easy, Jim.
6483720	6486720	According to Jim, the show is almost over.
6486720	6491720	Okay, you cast it on this gem, and it seems to not shrink.
6491720	6493720	But then it does.
6493720	6495720	Yeah!
6495720	6496720	That's good story telling.
6496720	6497720	That's drama.
6497720	6498720	That is good.
6498720	6499720	Good show.
6499720	6500720	Yeah.
6500720	6502720	Because for a second it seemed like it wasn't going to shrink.
6502720	6503720	I know.
6503720	6504720	And then...
6504720	6505720	And I was like, oh, God.
6505720	6506720	And then a truck.
6506720	6508720	That's what I was going for.
6508720	6510720	That is what you were going for.
6511720	6516720	I can't see, so I go, guys, did it shrink right away, or was there a moment?
6516720	6517720	No.
6517720	6518720	I did the exact same thing.
6518720	6519720	I thought it wasn't going to shrink.
6519720	6520720	And then...
6521720	6523720	You guys must have been terrified for that split second.
6523720	6524720	Yeah, right at the start.
6524720	6526720	When it seemed like it wasn't going to shrink.
6526720	6528720	Cut the chatter red, too.
6532720	6533720	Yeah.
6533720	6538720	So as you shrink the power gem, you notice the ambient lights of all the glowing things
6538720	6542720	above your head start to dim and go dim.
6543720	6546720	So now that was the light dimmer.
6546720	6549720	Great work by our lighting expert.
6549720	6550720	They're over there.
6550720	6552720	Literally, I saw them walk away.
6554720	6556720	Adventure!
6557720	6558720	Shh!
6558720	6559720	Shh!
6559720	6560720	Shrink your gem!
6560720	6562720	Sorry, go ahead.
6562720	6564720	Shrink your gem!
6565720	6566720	I'm being ironic.
6566720	6567720	I know you can't.
6567720	6568720	You don't have a spot.
6568720	6570720	You know I'm in a foot, and I really can't.
6570720	6571720	You don't know you're in a foot.
6571720	6574720	You made that assumption from the moment we went down those two black holes.
6574720	6576720	I really can't hear you.
6577720	6578720	I think you can.
6578720	6581720	We're like Beastmaster and Beastmasty.
6581720	6582720	Thanks.
6582720	6585720	I'm a huge fan of your work, too.
6585720	6587720	Huge fan of your work, too.
6587720	6588720	Oh, thank you.
6588720	6589720	Thank you.
6589720	6590720	Inspired by it.
6590720	6591720	Thank you.
6591720	6592720	That's not possible, but thank you.
6592720	6593720	Oh, well.
6593720	6596720	Guys, maybe we should slow down on taking off this hat and give them a little more time
6597720	6598720	Yeah.
6598720	6600720	We stopped sawing.
6601720	6602720	We're just going to give them a little more time.
6602720	6604720	No, don't stop sawing!
6604720	6606720	Yeah, don't stop on our account.
6606720	6608720	We just don't want to invade your intimacy.
6608720	6609720	Keep sawing, you guys.
6609720	6610720	Saw our way.
6610720	6611720	Wait, what happened?
6611720	6612720	It shrunk.
6612720	6613720	That was a good thing, right?
6613720	6614720	Yeah, yeah.
6614720	6616720	Guys, the show's over in a minute.
6616720	6618720	Okay, we're about...
6618720	6622720	Is there any way you can get to the other foot quickly and also shrink it?
6622720	6623720	Nope.
6623720	6624720	Sorry, everybody.
6625720	6630720	Can I put my armor on the saw to make it go faster to heat up the metal?
6630720	6631720	It kills my saw again.
6631720	6632720	Yeah, it would.
6633720	6634720	Hey!
6634720	6635720	This saw.
6635720	6636720	I think, is it possible?
6636720	6641720	I mean, this is putting a lot of onus on the bonus here, but is it possible, because we're
6641720	6646720	wrapping the show up here, we've got to get out of here, like maybe Avenger and Sharpie
6646720	6649720	have a kind of a moment here, like to kind of some sort of cliffhanger.
6649720	6650720	But we're separated.
6650720	6651720	Huh?
6651720	6652720	Well, get together and have a...
6652720	6653720	You guys are both...
6653720	6659220	I think what we need to do is pull back from the whole combat scene to a kind of Rod Serling-like
6659220	6661720	genie voiced by Robin Williams.
6661720	6663720	All right.
6663720	6664720	We'll just sort of...
6665720	6667720	Oh, they're in trouble now.
6671720	6672720	That's our show, everybody.
6672720	6673720	Thank you so much.
6676720	6677720	We fucking did it.
6678720	6680720	Thank you so much, everybody, for coming.
6680720	6681720	One more time.
6681720	6682720	Aaron McGathey.
6683720	6684720	Spencer Crittenden.
6684720	6686720	Kumail Nanjiani.
6687720	6688720	Mitch Hurwitz.
6693720	6694720	I'm Jeff Davis.
6694720	6696720	One more time for your mayor, Dan Hartman.
6698720	6699720	Thank you all.
6699720	6700720	Have a good night.
