14560	15560	There we go.
15560	16560	Jeff Davis is so, so far away.
16560	17560	I've stepped in.
17560	18560	My name is Brandon Johnson.
18560	19560	I'll be consoling tonight.
19560	29280	Let us welcome to the stage, our King, our Dungeon Master, Spencer Brinton.
29280	30280	Yes!
30280	31280	Yes!
31280	32280	Enjoy him!
32280	33280	Enjoy him!
33280	43280	You all know him as the mayor, the chief surfayer, bullshocker locker.
43280	49280	Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.
49280	53920	Hello, hello, hello.
53920	58520	It's my podcast show.
58520	63600	Hello, hello, hello.
63600	69120	Welcome to my podcast show.
69120	75800	Can you hear me though?
75800	81800	I said no to your mama's big toe podcast show.
81800	83800	Fuck your mama.
83800	84800	Okay.
84800	91720	I thought I'd try a different, I don't know about the applause, but if it was organic,
91720	92720	you can applaud.
92720	93720	That's fine.
93720	99840	There was a very, I keep having an emotional flashback in my head to our last episode when
99840	111400	I was commending David Cummings from the No Sleep podcast on his graceful delivery,
111400	122160	curating or advocating and weaving of the LGBT kind of pride week kind of thing.
122160	128280	I said what I had to say as far as kudos, and then you were like, you did this, I was
128280	129280	so embarrassed.
129280	133960	I haven't seen you in a week and this is the first thing you say to me.
133960	134960	I know.
134960	135960	Well, it's been a thing.
135960	140800	I don't like walking around with secrets from you, like you and I have a transparent relationship.
140800	141800	Where's the money?
141800	144840	Hey, let me ask you a question.
144840	146320	Why did I embarrass you?
146320	153280	Well, because I, you know, this is my problem, I realize it, but I always view the world.
153280	160360	I always have a camera on me that is the property of the person that hates me the most
160360	164360	in the world, and that's how I choose to view myself.
164360	170880	And so at this phase of my life, that's going to be your alt-righty kind of like I'm sick
170880	174280	and tired of this progress culture stuff.
174280	183400	And so for the forced like one, what is the sound of one man clapping kind of like thing,
183400	188760	I was like, they're going to love that, you know, because it's like, that's their impression
188760	193440	of it is like, that's why we're doing it, you know, that's why we're, that's why we
193440	197880	talk about this stuff is because we want our little Scooby snack, we want to make people
197880	198880	applaud.
199840	206800	Man, I make that camera like an old ass camera with a big tape when I see it, that's it.
206800	211680	Just so you know where I'm coming from, that's when I hear this camera that every that this
211680	214640	awful voice owns, I'm gonna make it like a nice camera.
214640	218320	Yeah, I make it like a really shitty camera.
218320	223720	Like before you bought it in Van Nuys, it was used for porn.
223720	228040	This is a thing is the only it's like, this is a thing that's like endemic to the stand
228040	229240	up community.
229240	233360	And I was a terrible stand up, but I was compatible with that community in one sense, which is
233360	235720	I think it's very like a stand up mentality.
235720	241440	It's like the guy in the back of the room that's not laughing, like, he's the smart
241440	248280	one, he knows, but, but for that reason, fuck him.
248280	252360	And I'm gonna fucking murder this room and his fucking face, you know, like, it's all
252360	256960	this like syndrome of like, you can never just like confront what's scaring you.
256960	263800	You know, I'm like, I just like, so much shame in my spinal column.
263800	265400	It's like, it's crazy.
265400	267000	I'm a shame driven man.
267000	271880	No, no, no, what are you arguing with that for?
271880	275160	I need to have that be true so I can fix it.
275160	276160	Don't tell me no.
276160	277160	All right.
277160	278160	I didn't know it was part of the episode.
278160	279160	All right.
279160	280160	Well, okay.
280160	282040	We got, we got, how long is this arc?
282040	284680	Are we talking like two, three more shows?
284680	288400	What till I'm not have no shame.
288400	294760	It's a 49 year story and I've been alive 45 years.
294760	298080	So I yeah, four years is the answer to your question.
298080	304160	It will be, I will, I will be done with this podcast and I will, I will Instagram under
304160	306040	my new account.
306040	309920	Hey, no shame.
309920	313920	It'll be like hidden in the comment of a, like a picture of a wine label.
313920	318080	Cody and I own a restaurant and some island or something.
318080	321880	I'll be like, by the way, I'm not ashamed of myself anymore.
321880	322880	Cody's dad.
322880	323880	Happy 70th birthday.
323880	329200	We spent since the last show.
329200	330200	Stephen Heller.
330200	332040	If you, you can, you can trace my Instagram.
332040	339120	You can see his, his, his, he's a photographer and we spent his 70th with him and went to
339120	342800	his sushi place and where the hell were we, Burbank?
342800	343800	I don't know where we were.
343800	345800	I don't know where he lives.
345800	349720	I'm never, I just follow, I just go where the Tesla tells me a guy plugged in a number.
349720	358280	But he was telling the stories about, you know, visiting his, his other daughter.
358280	363920	And I, I wrote this down because I thought it was such a great quote, it was offered
363920	364920	so sincerely.
364920	370720	He's telling a story about how he got, he had like, he just had kind of a wild night
370720	378040	and he goes like, so we go to the, we go to, we go to the, we go to the concert and, and
378040	384520	then there's a bar and we're, you know, we're having a good time.
384520	391160	I get over served.
391160	399560	So you know, a lot of this is, long story short, I got over served.
399560	401040	I like that a lot.
401040	405600	We are, we've got this CD case out, we're chopping it up and someone gives me a huge
405600	407800	line of cocaine.
407800	414600	I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got coke injected, someone blew a bunch of coke up
414600	415600	my nose.
415600	421640	I love it that you're kicking it with him at 70.
421640	422640	He's in good shape for 70.
422640	423640	He's still rolling.
423640	424720	He looks identical to me.
424720	428000	People see me and him and Cody and they're like, what's going on?
428000	436160	Like young lady, do your uncle and your dad want to, I don't know, park the car.
436160	442600	I don't know what the, I just, we look, we look the same age and that's, that's a warning
442600	447320	shot across my bow, but it's good, good for him.
447320	449720	There's 25 years between us.
449720	454560	I kind of want to like take the age between us and turn it into a dude and, and just talk
454560	455560	to him.
455560	459400	This is like, it's kind of like lump of 25 year old Play-Doh.
459400	460400	Like would he be cool?
460400	461400	Yeah.
461400	462400	Yeah.
462400	469960	I can't remember because I've been pretty drunk a lot lately.
469960	474320	I've been over served in these, in these shows a lot.
474320	476360	So I know I've been talking about fallout four.
476360	481880	I've been replaying fallout four, but have I talked about the Preston Garvey issue in
481880	482880	fallout four?
482880	484440	No, I don't think so.
484440	487840	Preston Garvey is a man that you meet early in the game.
487840	492800	He's a, he belongs to in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.
492800	502440	He's a, he's part of a, a now virtually extinct group of militia men called the Minutemen.
502440	508040	And they're kind of like, they borrow their culture from like the revolutionary Minutemen
508040	514360	and they represent like hope for the future in this wasteland.
514360	517880	He happens to be African-American and yes, that is an important part of the story.
517880	519480	Why are you looking at Spencer?
519480	520480	Yeah.
520480	521480	Yeah.
521480	524160	What the fuck, man?
524160	529160	So all of these characters like fallout four is a very, very, I'm sure it's got lots of
529160	533680	awards, but it really needs like special awards because it has these like the way that it
533680	536160	handles this concept of romance.
536160	541280	You can play as either gender and that's not me signing off on there being two genders.
541280	543880	Thank you very much.
543880	550120	According to this video game, apparently you got a salt or pepper, but but you, you can,
550120	556040	you can play as one of two genders and, and, but it doesn't, it doesn't like flip all the
556040	561360	other genders, like, which means that basically they're like, okay, so you might be gay and
561360	562400	playing the game.
562400	563400	You might be straight.
563400	564400	You might be a man.
564400	565400	You might be a woman.
565400	567100	Any combination of all of the above.
567100	573720	So they had to like, they had to create these characters that you hook, you, you, you encounter
573720	578720	and then they're your companions and they follow you around and then they, they will,
578720	582800	if they really get attached to you, they start, you know, they start gaining affinity
582800	586320	for you and then you're experiencing that through these conversations.
586320	592800	And within these conversations, like they had to keep in mind that this might be a man
592800	598480	talking to a man who is not interested in male, male sex, like, so, but on the other
598480	603720	hand, but it might also simultaneously be a man talking to a woman, a straight woman
603720	608280	that's playing, that's like really like, ooh, hello, sugar, sugar man, like, like when
608280	613040	she, when she sees this guy the first time, you know, it's good, like, and it's just,
613040	616680	it's kind of, it's, it's really this masterpiece because I'm looking at this 45 year old man
616680	621280	and I'm replaying Fallout 4 and I'm like, I, you know, it's just female characters that
621280	626720	they, then they go like, oh, it's me, my name's Piper and I'm a journalist and I'm like, oh,
626720	632760	I majored in journalism and like, hey, like, and it kind of like automatically like locked
632760	638760	into this thing of like, it like, like every time she, she goes like, Hey, can I tell you
638760	641560	something about my backstory and all this stuff?
641560	646600	And then there'll be a button that says flirt and then event and it'll build to a button
646600	648000	that says romance.
648000	649000	Wow.
649000	653000	So you can play it however you want, but I just think the most interesting thing is because
653000	657820	I started playing the game long enough that now all the guys are doing this too.
657820	663860	So here's the, just the amazing thing about, that I'm, that I'm learning about sexual projection
663860	670460	is that the women characters, when they say, Hey, can I talk to you about something for
670460	672660	a second?
672660	679020	You know, we've been traveling for a long time and I never knew how to trust anybody,
679020	684360	but you're really like traveling with you has really made me realize I need to get over
684360	687140	my defense mechanisms and, and trust people.
687140	691980	And I just wanted to let you know, I really, I really trust you and you're really special
691980	692980	to me.
692980	698100	And like, when it's a, when it's a woman, you, and then there's a button that comes
698100	699100	up that says flirt.
699100	702980	So you're, you retroactively go, Oh, she's hitting on me.
702980	703980	That's what I do.
703980	704980	I don't know why I'm saying you.
704980	705980	I'm sorry.
705980	710780	Like I, like I, and then, but then when, when, when it's a guy and he goes like, Hey, could
710780	712620	I talk to you for a second?
712620	718260	You know, when I first met you, I wasn't sure I thought you were a tub of guts, but
718260	721580	the universal brotherhood of steel needs everything they've gotten.
721580	727700	And I just got to say, you've given this old tin can soldier a new lease on life.
727700	733460	And then, and then what, and then the flirt button comes up and you're like, whoa.
733460	735060	But it's, it's really fascinating.
735060	737580	It's like an actual kind of an educational tool.
737580	743220	Cause it's like they had this, I mean, cause you're, the game isn't, the game is simply
743220	746500	saying, these are people who are growing fond of you.
746500	749900	And then it's up to you to project onto it any, any way you want.
749900	757740	And the, and, and I am ashamed to say as a, as a modern liberal, uh, this video game with
757740	762780	that I'm still, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't gone there with a dude yet.
762780	766700	And yet I have been so unfaithful in all of the female relationships.
766700	771180	I just keep, I just keep like, I'll, I'll max them out until I get all their combat
771180	774580	bonuses and then I'll assign them to a supply line with cattle or something.
774580	779300	Or I'll like, I'll put them in a field because I'm like, well, I got their combat bonuses
779300	782660	and now I'm letting out, now I'm with, now I'm with what's your name.
782660	784940	And like, so there's no shame about that.
784940	790340	There was a little bit of, there was a little bit of difficulty with it, but clearly I got
790340	792420	over it.
792420	795100	But I will not, I still won't fucking do it.
795100	796260	No one's watching me.
796260	802540	I know, I know the game isn't going to punish me or reward me in any particular way.
802540	807620	It's not going to make my character gay and like change my weapons.
807620	812780	It's it, it, I know that the only thing that's going to happen is the conclusion of a fucking
812780	816100	like algorithm and I still don't do it.
816100	817100	Shame on me.
817100	821340	I should be fucking everyone in the apocalyptic wasteland.
821340	822340	It's true.
822340	823340	It's true.
823340	826300	You might have more value in that community.
826300	830460	You might rise to a king because you met a dude and you guys fell in love and because
830460	833700	the way you set your shit up, you got to be the president.
833700	834700	It would be a myth.
834700	836820	So here's, this is why I brought this up.
836820	842540	So this is why it's important that Preston Garvey is African-American, right?
842540	849420	So Preston Garvey is one of these male characters who, so his is particularly, it's, it's legitimately
849420	854740	like it's, it's crazy like he, he, when he gets to the peak where it's time to either
854740	860140	hit romance or not, he says, Hey, can I talk to you about something?
860140	870780	You know, something I, I know I told you, uh, you know, what do you want me to do?
870780	874020	He's not, he doesn't, he doesn't have big headphones on and roller skates.
874020	879100	He's not like, Hey, I mean, you earlier did say something about confronting your fears
879100	880100	on stage.
880100	881100	Are we cool?
881100	885980	This, this, this guy, this guy, he's, he's, he sounds like you.
885980	894060	He's, he's, he's an, he's an unmistakably black man, but there's no impression to do
894060	895060	of him.
895060	897180	He's not like, Oh, I'm an Italian chef.
897180	903580	You know, like, and you're not like, yo, blood, like, uh, you're, you're Brandon.
903580	908700	I don't think, I don't think, you know, I'm not, it's like, like, and, and, and, uh, so
909300	910300	he's a gentleman.
910300	912620	He's, he likes to dress up.
912620	917380	I don't want, I don't mean to derail you and he's deep.
917380	924420	He's a deep thinker and he's an emotionally available friend.
924420	928820	And so he comes up to you when you're playing this game, when you get up to the, to the
928820	934340	peak levels with him, when he's been, and he, and he, what he says is he goes, um, can
934340	935340	I tell you something?
935340	939380	Well, you know, I already told you about how, um, you know, it's really important that
939380	943860	you, uh, uh, uh, fuck, I'm sorry.
943860	946780	It's important that he has this like even keel cause it's a voice actor reading a script
946780	947780	into a microphone.
947780	951100	So that's what's also creepy about it is that he's not, there is no like hemming and hawing
951100	952100	about it.
952100	954300	He's just like reading, just like saying these things.
954300	958980	I already told you about how when I first met you, I wasn't sure you were a natural
958980	964740	leader and then I was inspired by you, but there's one more thing I haven't told you
964740	971980	before I met you, uh, I lost so much hope that I wasn't sure if I wanted to live anymore.
971980	974180	I often thought about ending it all.
974180	979740	I'm, I've never told anyone that before, but I thought about ending it all, all the time.
979740	983060	And just before I met you, I was really thinking about ending it all.
983060	984900	And I really wanted to let you know that.
984900	993860	And then you have four buttons and one says like flirt, like, I don't know, like I won't
993860	996540	even save my place and just see what that is.
996540	1001900	Like, is it, is it what do you go like, well, if you ended it all, that would mean a couple
1001900	1005620	less drinks on me.
1005620	1007220	I don't know what that button is.
1007220	1012100	But then the, then one is like, Hey, let's keep this professional or something like that.
1012100	1018260	And then one is like the one I would hit in real life, which is like, thank you for being
1018260	1019260	honest with me.
1019260	1022820	I appreciate how hard that must be to you because you're telling what you're telling
1022820	1025340	me is you can't tell anybody about this.
1025340	1026700	So thank you.
1026700	1028940	So that's like, that's penultimate.
1028940	1033060	So then what happens is with these characters, if you, it turns out, if you don't friend
1033060	1037460	zone them, if you don't actively friend zone them with the B button, if you don't, there's
1037460	1043620	a button that basically says like, fucking chill, like, like keep it, keep it above the
1043620	1046500	belt and like rock on.
1046500	1049260	And I won't press that either.
1049260	1053900	So not only am I homophobic, I'm also like a crazy like codependent hunter.
1053900	1061980	Like I, like I just farm these guys that are like, I, when I walk through my, my, my settlement,
1061980	1069620	these men who are all, these men are all saying like, Hey, can we talk now?
1069620	1074740	And I'll get, I'll get cornered by them and I'll go, uh-huh.
1074740	1078140	And then, and then, and then Preston's like, his whole thing is he goes like, he keeps
1078860	1079860	doing it.
1079860	1080860	It's on a loop now.
1080860	1081860	And here's the thing.
1081860	1082860	It's like, okay.
1082860	1085380	He's first, now he's African-American.
1085380	1087900	He's dressed like a revolutionary soldier.
1087900	1092620	And through no selection of my own, he is working on crops.
1092620	1094860	Like he, like that's the default that happened.
1094860	1102460	So he's a black man dressed like 1700 soldier in a tricorner hat, digging in dirt, who when
1102460	1107620	I walked by, he pops out of a bushes that he's like cultivating and goes like, is now
1107620	1109220	is a good time for that talk.
1109220	1113900	And, and I go, maybe he's asking you to help him out.
1113900	1117940	And one of the, well, I always, I stop and I go, because, and one of the buttons is like,
1117940	1119900	I thought we already talked about this.
1119900	1124460	I swear that one of the buttons is like, we taught, we, I already, I already heard you.
1124460	1131940	And when you press that, he says, okay, cool, because I just never told anybody that before.
1131940	1135140	And then, and then one of the buttons says romance.
1135140	1140820	So you, and then one of the buttons says, keep it professional and I never press it.
1140820	1146460	And then one of the buttons says, thank you for sharing that I keep pressing it.
1146460	1148900	What am I doing?
1148900	1151740	And why don't I assign him to a different job?
1151740	1152740	It's uncomfortable.
1152740	1156420	Like, like, or put him in a different outfit, dress him as a space man.
1156420	1160820	At least like it's, it's a weird mind fuck.
1160820	1164300	There's also, there's other guys, there's guys that are like George Clooney's and like,
1164300	1168540	like armor and like, like, I don't know if the, I don't know if the robots eventually
1168540	1172580	come on to you, but, but, and then again, the point is they don't come on to you.
1172580	1178620	They, they might, they're, they're designed to just say, I have, I trust you and okay,
1178620	1179620	that's it.
1179620	1180860	So anyways, there's a lot of shit going on.
1180860	1185700	I want you to rescue this dude because he had to work for the military and he has some
1185700	1188260	beans that he's growing with his hands.
1188260	1190340	Maybe listen to him next time and see what he does.
1190340	1194220	I listen to him every time I'm trying to tell you, I listen to him every time I'm
1194220	1197060	caught in this crazy fucking hamster wheel.
1197060	1201740	Like maybe what if that's, what if we're just seeing a low five version of the simulation
1201740	1202860	that is real life?
1202860	1207260	What if my relationship with these people is like, is that like, I keep hitting the
1207260	1213100	A button on like, like, well, do you, do you need approval or do you want to be yourself?
1213100	1216500	And then I keep hitting this like this middle line option where I'm like, I appreciate you
1216500	1218380	coming to the show.
1218380	1222020	And then they keep hitting this button that's like, man, I'm a big fan of yours.
1222020	1227860	And we're just like, like, we're never going to like keep it professional nor are we going
1227860	1233340	to flirt, you know, like we're not going to like max our combat bonuses.
1233340	1242060	Um, anyways, uh, yeah, I, I, I'm really enjoying my fallout for fucking, that's a rich game.
1242060	1244140	It's a real good game.
1244140	1247180	The settlement aspect, like, like, like you gotta check it out.
1247180	1248180	That's for a different episode.
1248180	1251660	I'll be talking about fallout four for the next six episodes.
1251660	1253820	And uh, what is this new show?
1253820	1254820	The new show?
1254820	1255820	Yeah.
1255820	1256820	What are you watching?
1256820	1257820	Oh, maniac?
1257820	1258820	Yeah.
1258820	1259820	I like it.
1259820	1260820	Yeah.
1260820	1262500	I got, I got, I like it too.
1262500	1263500	She's great.
1263500	1264500	Oh, she's so good.
1264500	1265500	Yeah.
1265500	1266500	I know.
1266500	1269180	Is that, is there, we say, and she's an italics, like, like there's like a little subtext there
1269180	1274500	that if Jonah Hill's listening, he's like, like, yeah, she's amazing.
1274500	1277900	I just figured, you know, we'll start off with her first.
1278900	1279900	We'll give her her props first.
1279900	1280900	And then we'll work our way to Jonah Hill.
1280900	1281900	Calm down, Jonah Hill.
1281900	1284460	It is just, I love, I love, I like the construction of the show.
1284460	1286460	Like, I'm a very jaded TV viewer.
1286460	1292980	I don't, you know, like, you know, like, but I, I really, I'm really glad I stuck with
1292980	1293980	it.
1293980	1294980	Yeah.
1294980	1300260	And uh, I'm not done with it yet, but uh, I like, yeah, I like, I like the, the very,
1300260	1306500	very unique combination of giving you what you maybe didn't know you wanted while at
1306500	1308620	the same time continually going lateral.
1308620	1312260	So there's like, like stuff that's just, I'm always lateral.
1312260	1313260	I'm going lateral.
1313260	1314260	And it gets also so lateral.
1314260	1318180	It's predictable where it's like, like, like just sort of like, yeah, I get it.
1318180	1321900	You hate people, you know, and then there's stuff that's like, oh, I'm Charles Schultz.
1321900	1324180	I'm going to make you love like yours to your heart.
1324180	1327340	And like, you're like, okay, yeah, I can see your pattern there, but like, I like, I like
1327340	1328740	this nice blend here.
1328740	1335420	Like this isn't a, I don't, I don't feel like I'm in the hands of uh, uh, amateurs or old
1335420	1342980	stodgy foggy bottoms when I watch the show and I feel like I feel like I feel like it's
1342980	1344060	a, yeah, I like that.
1344060	1345860	I like the stuff that they're doing.
1345860	1347260	It stays out waiting.
1347260	1348260	Yeah.
1348260	1350980	I, there was a point where I said, okay, I really like the show now.
1350980	1353100	And it wasn't like at a point where anything got revealed.
1353100	1359180	It was just sort of like, it was like right at the top of the episode where now they're
1359180	1363780	into the second like iteration of them having different lives.
1363780	1367100	And he's like a magician that's like in the thing.
1367100	1371260	And then it wasn't, it wasn't that yet because previously in a jaded way, I said, so what
1371260	1372260	is this show?
1372260	1377260	Just gonna do this now every week, the different life and not really asking myself what I like
1377260	1378260	that or not.
1378260	1381380	And then, and then when I, when I started giving it to me and I was like, okay, I like
1381380	1382380	it.
1382380	1386620	But, but, but also more importantly that they came out and they're showing the computer
1386620	1391260	people and then what the computer people were saying and how the, the, the, the, the attention
1391260	1395700	that they're paying to the, to the logic of the sci-fi is really important to me.
1395700	1396700	Yeah.
1396700	1397700	Yeah.
1397700	1400660	And there's a lot of like thought about psychology in it.
1400660	1403260	That's not just as simple as like, I'm Tyler Durden.
1403260	1410340	I'm like, I represent your fucking Booyah side, you know?
1410340	1412340	Incredible.
1412340	1415020	There's like clearly a lot of thought going into like, what is that?
1415020	1419460	Like you really like, like, oh, the difference between her and him on a fundamental level
1419460	1420460	and stuff.
1420460	1421460	Okay.
1421460	1424540	I've, I've made our guests wait long enough.
1424540	1429460	He I met, I met him at my neighbor, Beth's house.
1429460	1433540	Her son, Tim, boy, there's a lot of backstory here that's just like, you wouldn't even
1433540	1434540	know.
1434540	1435940	So Dan had this tree, right?
1435940	1436940	Yeah.
1436940	1439700	I had this tree that had to get cut down.
1439700	1440700	Great episode.
1440700	1441700	Classic Harmon town.
1441700	1442700	Right.
1442700	1444260	I'm an amazing episode.
1444260	1450420	Our neighbor, my neighbor Beth and her, you might remember her kid as the nutty kid.
1451020	1454740	Who always did the haunted house every year, the haunted maze.
1454740	1457380	So you know, kids grow up fast.
1457380	1458900	We've been doing this shit for a long time.
1458900	1462180	So he's like 40 now.
1462180	1467940	And he made, he made a short film and like all this stuff like, like, so I was, I was
1467940	1471540	just at their house at a, at a barbecue and I met this guy and he told me about his YouTube
1471540	1473820	thing and it's like, you should come on the show and plug that anyways.
1473820	1477220	Let's talk to him about it instead of me explaining it to you, please.
1477220	1479220	Welcome my new friend, Omar Camacho.
1495620	1496620	I did a little fist bump.
1500460	1501460	Okay.
1501460	1512420	Omar, Omar is a star, Omar is a star of a YouTube series.
1512420	1516420	It's hard to do this terminology now because, okay, so you got your YouTube and then you
1516420	1521460	get your YouTube channels like these people that have a channel called me to write, not
1521460	1523300	to be confused with hashtag me too.
1523300	1524300	No, no, no, no.
1524300	1526300	This is me too.
1526300	1527300	Yeah.
1527300	1530820	I'm a guy with a slanty, uh, uh, instead of a dot.
1530820	1531820	Is the you, I think.
1531820	1532820	Oh, is it?
1532820	1533820	Yeah.
1533820	1535220	Oh, you think it makes me feel better that you don't know.
1535220	1536220	Nah.
1536220	1537220	Yeah.
1537220	1538220	Yeah.
1538220	1539220	I don't know.
1539220	1540220	I'm kind of was in the green room chilling right now.
1540220	1541220	You know what I mean?
1541220	1542220	It's like, could be the eye.
1542220	1543220	Could be the you.
1543220	1544220	Could be IRU.
1544220	1545220	I don't know.
1545220	1547100	I just, I'm a, I'm a white guy and I see, I see the little accents that you have to
1547100	1551020	hold a, an iPhone button down long to get, and I'm just like, that's Gandalf shit.
1551020	1553820	I don't even know.
1553820	1557100	I know the name of one, which is a tilde, right?
1557100	1558100	And that's what makes.
1558100	1559100	Yeah.
1559100	1560100	Yeah.
1560100	1561100	You're right about that.
1561100	1562100	You know what's up, man?
1562100	1563100	I know that's more Mexican than I am.
1563100	1564100	The tilde, you hit it in a fallout four.
1564100	1569060	If you want to do console commands, you want to like, you can use it to raise the, uh,
1569060	1571900	the, uh, uh, graphic budget of your settlements.
1571900	1572900	Oh.
1572900	1581300	Um, anyways, but, um, so you do there, so me too, uh, does this, they do all kinds of
1581300	1587380	shit and one of the things they do is a recurring like series, Cholo's try.
1587380	1588900	Yeah, definitely, man.
1588900	1592500	It's a, it's, you know, it's just something that they put together real quick on the,
1592500	1593500	on the fly.
1593500	1596500	I think, you know, cause it just happened so divinely that, you know, we've got, it
1596500	1600780	got all this recognition, you know, uh, cause we want to see Cholo's try stuff.
1600780	1603140	And sorry, I don't want to get too familiar with that word cause that's the one thing
1603140	1604140	I wanted to ask you.
1604140	1605140	All right.
1605140	1606140	First, let's define Cholo.
1606140	1610740	I looked it up in the, on the phone on the way here and I knew that I would see one definition
1610820	1615100	that I kind of would have guessed because it's just my white guilt kind of like it that
1615100	1619900	it's sort of like, uh, there's a, there's a definition that's sort of like a derogatory,
1619900	1625420	uh, uh, whatever, like kind of the definition that I would have guessed maybe, but then
1625420	1630900	there was the one that then there was all this shit about Mestizo, like, like, like
1630900	1633540	people with different blood and all this stuff.
1633540	1635460	There's like a lot of, it goes deep, man.
1635460	1637260	It goes very, very deep, man.
1637260	1642820	But now, I mean, nowadays in modern era, you know, it gets, uh, misrepresented, you
1642820	1643900	know, as a negative thing.
1643900	1649140	So that's what, you know, the, the media, you know, profiles, what a gangster is a Cholo,
1649140	1650140	you know what I'm saying?
1650140	1653700	And as long as it's the title of your show, I can use it in that context.
1653700	1658940	But if I were, I'd have to be a very trusted white guy in a bar to like, to like refer
1658940	1665220	to somebody in the third person as Cholo, like, like, like in front of someone of Mexican
1665220	1666220	descent.
1666220	1668820	Like, they would be like, they would bristle, like, why are you using that word?
1668820	1669820	I'm a fucking mechanic, bro.
1669820	1671660	What the hell are you talking about, bro?
1671660	1675020	Like, like, cause it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not an innocent phrase.
1675020	1679180	It's like, it's, it's got like, uh, yeah, it's not, it gets thrown out a lot.
1679180	1680180	You know what I mean?
1680180	1683980	But, but then there's the traditional kind of like taking it, taking it back.
1683980	1685380	I actually wanted to read the definition.
1685380	1686380	Yeah.
1686380	1690700	Cause I mean, what it is, what, you know, what we all know it for nowadays is, you know,
1690700	1693700	a thug ass homie in the hood, a thug ass homie in the hood.
1693700	1694700	Yeah.
1694700	1698940	But I would have guessed it's an informal offensive, a lower class Mexican, especially
1698940	1699940	in an urban area.
1699940	1700940	There.
1700940	1701940	Wow.
1701940	1702940	Yeah.
1702940	1703940	Pretty easy.
1703940	1704940	Oh wow.
1704940	1705940	That's fucked up Webster's dictionary.
1705940	1710620	See, I'm going to have to holler at him.
1710620	1716460	Before that, though, it says a Latin American with Indian blood, semicolon, a mestizo.
1716460	1718980	And I was like, what?
1718980	1719980	Right.
1719980	1724820	And then you ask a teenage boy, especially in a Mexican American community, who is a
1724820	1726540	member of a street gang.
1726540	1727540	Yeah.
1727540	1728540	Well, yeah.
1728540	1729540	You know, that's what it is.
1729540	1731180	You know, but what is a 16 year old boy?
1731180	1732180	It's a teenage boy.
1732180	1733180	Oh shit.
1733180	1735620	Most people start gang banging at eight years old, man.
1735620	1739140	Well, yeah, I think, well, if you're, you know, if you're really thugged up, eight's
1739140	1749540	the new 13, you get those, you get those, uh, uh, those quinceañera tattoos.
1749540	1752460	I fake it till you make it, Harmon.
1752460	1759180	Um, speaking of which, so how much of a cholo did like, like, how much do you, do you gleefully
1759180	1760180	self apply that?
1760180	1764900	And how much are you like, I'm an actor and I want to own my, I don't want to be like
1764900	1771220	a sellout and like, say, please, uh, absorb me, uh, uh, you know, like, like, what, what's
1771220	1772620	your relationship with that word?
1772620	1776900	Well, it's a trip, man, because right now how I feel about it, it's ironic that, you
1776900	1782020	know, it's, it's kind of fucked up sometimes that you get typecasted in the industry.
1782020	1783020	You know what I'm saying?
1783020	1785500	And play this thug role, cholo or prisoner or whatever, you know what I mean?
1785500	1789980	So the media perceives us as that, you know, that's a lot of the times we get those roles.
1789980	1790980	Yeah.
1790980	1795540	But, um, before me jumping into the industry, before I got exposed to like, you know, doing
1795540	1800020	extra stuff and then, you know, lead roles and some small shit and feature shit or whatever,
1800020	1803820	you know, uh, I grew up in the ghetto, man, I grew up in the hood, man, I'm from East
1803820	1807180	LA, was raised in South Central and I grew up in Compton, man.
1807180	1810300	So it was like, I got, I got all of that shit at an early age.
1810300	1812580	I used to tag and shit, you know what I mean?
1812580	1817460	Your friends, if you, if you, if you, YouTube cholos try and watch this guy, this, this
1817460	1822980	guy is the, he's the Paul Rudd of the cholos, like, like in the, in the, you are not covered
1822980	1828100	with like very intimidating, uh, I assume prison tattoos with scar, with scar in prison.
1828100	1829100	Yeah.
1829100	1833380	I mean, I don't know if to be honest with you, um, that's fucking loyalty right there.
1834380	1837100	I let him, I let him tell you that shit, you know.
1837100	1838460	Was your friend ever in jail?
1838460	1839460	I don't know, man.
1839460	1843220	I don't even know if that dude's my friend, officer, I'll be honest with you.
1843220	1844780	I thought that was a lady.
1844780	1846780	Was it a dude right there?
1846780	1849540	I don't, I don't speak English.
1849540	1857420	I don't know nothing, because Spencer, one of the, one of the cholos, I, again, using
1857420	1861500	that phrase in the context it's provided, not, not like I'm all excited to call people,
1861500	1862740	to dehumanize people.
1862740	1868940	One of the cholos, um, from cholos try is this guy's scar, who has a fucking Omar from
1868940	1874820	the wire scar going down, but not, well, Omar's thing is like more fucked, like this is, is
1874820	1875820	that real?
1875820	1876820	Cause it looks cinematic.
1876820	1882620	It looks like a lion tried to kill him with its middle finger and he closed his eyes at
1882620	1883620	just the right time.
1883620	1887700	So he has like a fucking thing going down his forehead that continues in a slightly
1887700	1889100	offset way down his cheek.
1889100	1890100	Yeah.
1890100	1891500	Does he have a story for that scar?
1891500	1896420	Um, other than being a big fan of the Lion King that I know, you know, that's the homie,
1896420	1897420	you know, that's my boy.
1897420	1901100	And it's a tat, you know, a lot of people do think it's something that's for reals for
1901100	1902100	reals, but it's a, it's a tat.
1902100	1903100	Oh, it's a tat too.
1903100	1904100	Yeah.
1904100	1905100	The homie will tell you.
1905100	1906100	Ah, fucking scar.
1906100	1907100	Come on.
1907100	1908100	Yeah.
1908100	1909740	But you know, uh, from what the homie has ever told me, like, cause I've asked him,
1909740	1914060	you know, and I'm like, yeah, fool, you know, uh, some, something about the Lion King,
1914060	1917380	you know, scar, the, the, the uncle and shit, y'all know what's up with that movie back
1917380	1918380	in the day.
1918380	1919380	It's like the uncle.
1919380	1920380	Yeah.
1920460	1924020	I guess he liked the name and he liked the scar right there and then, you know, he went
1924020	1925020	all out with it.
1925020	1926020	Yeah.
1926020	1931500	I can't believe you got me impugning, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a Cholo's, uh, a Cholo
1931500	1932500	ship.
1932500	1934100	Uh, I'm like, wait, that's a tattoo.
1934100	1935100	Oh, what a poser.
1935100	1936100	Hey, but you, hey.
1936100	1944620	I mean, the other guy, what, what is it with the, the, uh, cause, can you, so you really
1944620	1945620	can't answer that.
1945620	1949860	Cause I, I thought, I thought there was, I thought something that you guys, one of you
1949860	1954540	guys said in one of the things that I saw, someone referred, otherwise I wouldn't cause
1954540	1960700	I'd be afraid to be offensive to do it, that someone referred to the his tats and the other
1960700	1965180	and one of the other guys as, as prison tattoos, that they were, that they were prison tattoos.
1965180	1966180	Nah.
1966180	1970380	Another, another thing the homie would tell me, he, he said he was eating pineapple.
1970380	1971380	That's how I got that.
1971380	1972380	You know, he didn't pineapple.
1972380	1976380	He was trying to throw a little zinger out there.
1976380	1977380	You know what I'm saying?
1977420	1982860	So I get it full eating some raunchy shit on you guys are like actors who are like bunched
1982860	1987740	together by a YouTube producer who's like, here, like now watch Mean Girls and tell us
1987740	1988740	what you think.
1988740	1991820	Like they're not, you're not like, Hey, it's good to see you again.
1991820	1992820	Yeah.
1992820	1993820	Yeah.
1993820	1994820	Yeah.
1994820	1998100	It was basically something that was just, you know, I guess plied it on for like a week or
1998100	1999100	something.
1999100	2000100	I don't know.
2000100	2001100	Cause I got hit up with that shit last minute.
2001100	2005780	Some of the things that the Cholos try on Cholos try hipster fashion, which I thought
2005820	2010380	was really interesting because, because it was like, well, I thought it was interesting.
2010380	2015540	It was, were you guys making that gas face, like based on like certain shit that I couldn't
2015540	2021340	like cause fashion in general, I can't, I'm like, what like, like, and so like, like seeing
2021340	2027100	a guy who's like, who's like comfort zone is like with the, the button to the top button
2027100	2029300	thing with the, you know, the flannel.
2029300	2034060	And then, and then you put that guy in a pretty much the same shirt, but all the buttons on
2034060	2035060	the sleeves are short.
2035060	2037140	And he's like, well, I feel like a Poindexter.
2037140	2042380	And I'm like, you look, you already look like a Poindexter to me that I thought that I always
2042380	2044180	thought that was part of the, like the whole threat.
2044180	2048380	Like you see, like a, like when you see a dude and he's got the sandals and socks and
2048380	2053820	the socks are all the way up and you're, you look normal with that on kind of shit.
2053820	2059700	Is there anything that like, like, uh, uh, Cholo culture, I fucking don't want to, I
2059700	2062500	feel so dumb saying that phrase.
2062500	2065900	Did you confirm a suspicion that I've had since moving to LA where it's like, some
2065900	2070860	of that stuff is like, I dare you to fucking like think less of me.
2070860	2071860	Like, like, like do it.
2071860	2076500	Like, I guess I could say like any urban like fashion choices, like where it's like, whether
2076500	2080660	it's like a price tag hanging off of things or like something like, like, like, like doing
2080660	2088060	things wrong on purpose as like a red flag to a, to, to, to a, to a white bull that it's
2088060	2091100	like, like, why don't you, yeah, come, come, come at me kind of thing.
2091100	2095940	Like please make the mistake of like, of, of, of saying that I shouldn't be wearing
2095940	2096940	this after labor day.
2096940	2102020	Well, now for me personally, as long as you're in fuck with me, you don't pose no threat
2102020	2103020	of wearing that kind of shit.
2103020	2104540	You could have wear whatever the fuck you want.
2104540	2105540	You know what I mean?
2105540	2106540	Just don't catch me wearing that shit.
2106540	2107820	I don't wear that tight stuff, man.
2107820	2108820	I don't know.
2108820	2109820	I got to breathe, man.
2109820	2114780	And literally when I fucking tried that stuff on bro, literally I felt like kicking my
2114780	2116940	own ass down.
2116940	2120580	I swear to God, dude, there was some stuff where I was like, okay, I can see how you're
2120580	2121580	uncomfortable with that.
2121580	2122580	Other stuff.
2122580	2124420	I was like, to me, that looks pretty much the same.
2124420	2128500	Like it is just a different kind of t-shirt and that like, like, but you can't really
2128500	2130220	fuck with nobody for what they wearing.
2130220	2131220	You know what I'm saying?
2131220	2133460	Catch a felony for that shit, you know what I mean?
2133460	2138860	But you know, shit, I mean, I just fuck kind of trend you on, you know what I'm saying?
2138860	2140620	Like I'm from, I'm an eighties baby.
2140620	2141620	You know what I mean?
2141620	2144380	So I grew up in the late eighties and the nineties, you know what I'm saying?
2144380	2145380	2000.
2145380	2146860	So I always wear that 501 shit.
2146860	2147860	You know what I'm saying?
2147860	2150300	Black, white, solid T, white T, whatever.
2150300	2151300	You know what I'm saying?
2151300	2152300	Dickies and all that shit.
2152300	2155740	But I feel like these dudes adopted some of that from us.
2155740	2156740	You know what I mean?
2156740	2158700	Because, you know, with the flannels, you know what I mean?
2158700	2159700	These dudes wear flannels.
2159700	2161380	It's just for these cats.
2161380	2162380	I don't know.
2162380	2165180	Maybe they ain't fluffy like me, man, but they, they got some, they always wear that
2165180	2166180	shit tight, dude.
2166180	2167940	It's like, can you even bend?
2167940	2171020	Can you climb up a stair or something when you, you know what I'm saying?
2171020	2174220	With that tight ass shit on, you know, they tough them on the bottom.
2174220	2175220	I don't know.
2175220	2179140	I think that I'm saying like underneath this, I am all sinew and muscle.
2179140	2181420	Like I'm, I need to keep warm.
2181420	2184420	Yeah, well, you try to be on my chest out with that shit on, homie.
2184420	2186300	You in the wrong city, though.
2186300	2187300	Yeah.
2187300	2188300	Childless.
2188300	2191740	You guys, the Cholos, try.
2191740	2192740	Hipster fashion.
2192740	2197460	We watched Mean Girls, which was really just a couple of dudes watching Mean Girls and
2197460	2198460	getting it.
2198460	2199460	Like it was just like, oh, okay.
2199460	2200460	Yeah.
2200460	2202900	She's now, oh, now she's realizing that it's not about that.
2202900	2203900	It's about this.
2203900	2204900	Okay.
2204900	2205900	Gotcha.
2205900	2206900	Gotcha, homie.
2206900	2209100	My honey man made me watch that shit after she saw the episode.
2209100	2210100	And I was like, nah, I'm good.
2210100	2212540	I just saw little pieces of it, but I'm gonna be real, man.
2212540	2213540	I like that shit.
2213540	2214540	Shit was tight.
2214540	2216980	What is your favorite part of that?
2216980	2222420	Well, basically, the fact that the chick is from Africa, right?
2222420	2228220	And she comes over, just that my favorite part was the food fight.
2228220	2229220	Okay.
2229220	2230220	You know what I'm saying?
2230220	2233580	It reminded me a lot of, a lot of back in high school, man, I started a couple food
2233580	2237580	fights and shit like a clown, threw a couple of chicken patties and shit at somebody, you
2237580	2238580	know?
2238580	2239580	And that was cool.
2239580	2241340	It brought back flashbacks and I liked that it was cool, you know?
2241340	2245820	It had a cool little twist to it, so, you know, I'm a big movie buff, too, so I'm not
2245820	2250100	gonna shy from, you know, watching some shit just because it's a chick flick.
2250100	2254900	My chick wants to watch it, hey, blaze out, let's Netflix and chill and shit.
2254900	2255900	Yeah, man.
2255900	2261780	Movies are, yeah, like, yeah, like, well, yeah, all right, well, I put a pin in that.
2261780	2266980	I want to get back to that, like Dan's playing that business, but I was like, you guys surf,
2266980	2272660	you golf, you ballroom dance, but the stuff that's got more interesting is like the stuff
2272660	2276500	that's not so, it's like, like, you watch Speedy Gonzales.
2276500	2280260	Oh, dawg, that's like the most racist shit ever, dude.
2280260	2281260	I swear, man.
2281260	2286260	At the top of it, like, it's just so funny when somebody says the most obvious thing,
2286260	2289820	but it's like, takes on such charisma as, I can't remember which guy it is, but it's
2289820	2293420	like in the intro to the video, it's like, we're gonna watch Speedy Gonzales.
2294420	2303660	I used to watch it when I was a kid, and Speedy was, Speedy was, he was my homie, but now I'm
2303660	2310940	an adult, and I know what racism is, so it might be different, I don't know.
2310940	2311940	Oh, man.
2311940	2316220	I haven't watched it in a while, let's check it out, and then it's just, as you would predict,
2316220	2321580	but then, are they still making that movie, or is that, is that just kibosh?
2321580	2323460	Do we know if they're still making a Speedy Gonzales movie?
2323460	2326940	I'm gonna have to update on that one, man, because I'm really curious to see what they
2326940	2330660	come out with, and you know, you know how it is in the game, man.
2330660	2333700	You know, you hear it's about, you know, way in advance, so I don't know if it might be
2333700	2338340	a next year thing, or even how true to the fact that is, it's just we came across it,
2338340	2341580	and you know, that's what it was, we were like, let's review this shit, and what happened?
2341580	2344260	Well, in that simple thing, it's just like, oh, we watched Speedy Gonzales, and then we
2344260	2348420	commented on it, and it's just a YouTube video, but it's like, the place where it's left is
2348420	2353100	the same place that, after maybe two years of me trying to be woke, and like, figure
2353100	2358940	shit out, like, as a writer, as a TV writer, who has influence over people, my mini-hit
2358940	2359940	shows.
2359940	2360940	Of course, yeah.
2360940	2365540	Like, there's a constant pressure on me, like, Harmon, get your brain right, you're
2365540	2368260	affecting like, so many people, like, uh...
2368260	2372180	Waking up looking like Doc and shit on Back to the Future, huh, like, what the fuck is
2372180	2373180	going on?
2373180	2376900	And I try to decode the same stuff that you end up talking about in the end, right in
2376900	2377900	the end.
2377900	2381140	It's like, you watch a bunch of clips of Speedy Gonzales, he's going, arriba, arriba.
2381140	2386340	One person notes that, we never sing La Cucaracha for anything, there's no occasion, there's
2386340	2387340	no...
2387340	2395340	It's his boy, his boy is like, lazy, it's not just Speedy, it's that they made Slow
2395340	2396340	Cucaracha.
2396340	2400620	Oh, no, the thing is for still with all of these, like, things, but you're so, like,
2400620	2403580	and then in the end of it, it's like, you're like, if they make the movie, I think it's
2403580	2409340	you saying this, you're like, if they make the movie, look, you know, like, I'm not saying
2409340	2413340	don't make the movie, but, like, you should probably involve some Mexican people, all
2413340	2416780	this stuff, which is, like, we all have this, like, kind of, we're coming around to this
2416780	2420340	wisdom, but it's like, this is this thing, like, you don't have to have an answer to
2420340	2424940	this either, because this is what we keep struggling with, is we have this, like, we're
2424940	2431180	like, we use this word culture, and then, so then, half the time, we're like, we treat
2431180	2437180	culture like it's, like, a butterfly in a museum or something, or, like, oh, my God,
2437180	2441020	this thing's gonna die out, or you gotta stay true to this thing and all this stuff, but
2441020	2446460	then, like, you could be a villain and stay true to your culture, like, which is exhibited
2446460	2452100	by, you know, this show saying, like, you know, like, well, let's go skydiving, like,
2452100	2456260	it doesn't mean that only white people skydive, and it doesn't mean that Mexican people never
2456260	2462900	skydive, but it's, like, we're cholos, we're striking a silhouette here, let's go skydiving,
2462900	2468260	let's go golfing, let's go surfing, but it's, like, it does, it's, like, the thing that,
2468260	2473980	like, my Asperger brain, like, can't fucking, it's, like, what is my, it's, it's, it's, it's,
2473980	2478500	it's, like, and I know the answer is neither, it's just, like, some combination of the two,
2478500	2482340	but it's just, like, this constant fucking thing where it's, like, are we, are we all
2482420	2488260	supposed to be alike, or are we all supposed to, like, like, represent, you know? Man, I see it
2488260	2491940	like this, man, I see it as, like, fuck the stereotypes, man, because that's what everybody
2491940	2496100	got us twisted with, everybody, our cultures, you know what I'm saying, the stereotypes and shit,
2496100	2500260	you know, and, and, and doing this shit right, and getting it right, and saying the truth,
2500260	2506820	you know what I mean? Because, I mean, the reason why we saw that now as a, as, damn, this shit is
2506820	2511620	racist as fuck, is because, you know, we saw it as in a, we see it as an adult, but as kids,
2511620	2515940	we don't see that, you know what I'm saying? And the people who are writing these cartoons,
2515940	2521700	and coming up with these cartoons, are pretty much generating those stereotypes, like, oh,
2521700	2525140	these fools, all they do is fucking work in the warehouse, and all this and that, you know what
2525140	2531620	I mean? You know what I mean? So, it's like, if, if that is, if that is what it is, you know, there's
2531620	2536020	people out there trying to break from that, you know what I'm saying? We don't just all work in
2536020	2540580	this fucking warehouse, I work in the office, dude, I'm cool, I'm chilling, clerical work,
2540580	2544660	homie, I'm born here, so I got rights, you know what I mean? So, I'm doing my thing, but I'm not
2544660	2549300	gonna let my people's shit go in vain, you know what I mean? For what they came here to do, but
2549300	2556260	see, that's, that's what's projected at that time, you know what I'm saying? As, as a stereotype, that's,
2556260	2559940	maybe, is why you're having that, that little clash, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, because we,
2559940	2564340	we celebrate stuff, because it's like, it's like, it's like, like, we celebrate, like, cultures,
2564340	2568180	and it's like, like, the, one of the big things that I'm learning about as a white person, is that
2568180	2572740	there is shit to learn about, like, the idea that, that, that without perceiving it, that I,
2573620	2577940	that I never, I never knew that I was making this active choice, which is what somebody else might
2577940	2582260	have to do when they wake up in the morning, that I was actually, without making the choice, that I
2582260	2588820	was actually thinking of myself as default, vanilla, mainstream, normal, like, like, like, like, the,
2589380	2593220	the, that, that's the thing that we're coping with right now, is like, is, is like white people
2593220	2596500	going like, what did I do? I didn't do anything wrong, what's going on around here? What's with
2596500	2601300	all the alarm bells? And it's like, I didn't do anything. And it's like, yeah, you didn't do
2601300	2605860	anything. And while you weren't doing anything, you can't, you're like, well, who am I? What the
2605860	2612660	fuck am I? And so then we get into these, like, I think the, the, the evil versions of me are, are,
2612660	2617140	are people that are equally confused, but their confusion generates like this, this anger and
2617140	2621060	frustration where they're just like, what the fuck are we supposed to do? What am I, what am I,
2621060	2626420	like, I, I think I could, I've told this story on this, on this podcast before, like, I was
2626420	2632340	working with this writer who, he was researching like Henry Ford in that era. And he told me this
2632340	2639300	anecdote about Henry Ford at his factories, like he had this thing called like American Day or
2639300	2644820	something. And he would encourage all of his workers that were from all over the world, he would say,
2644900	2650420	if you're going to dress like you're Polish, like, like for real, it's, it's like sort of,
2651620	2657220	you'd imagine it being like some kind of like, like themed Friday or Taco Tuesday or something.
2657220	2662900	It was like, you know, like, but it was basically like ethnic day. But because they would, they would
2662900	2667300	do this ceremony, like whatever you are, if you're Polish, like where your most Polish outfit, if
2667300	2672420	you're Mexican, where your most Mexican outfit is good. Yeah. And, and so, and then they would do
2672420	2679940	this big ceremony on the factory floor where they had a literal giant melting pot. All of these
2680500	2685220	prideful, grateful workers who were part of this new experiment called America would like wearing
2685220	2691380	their Polish outfits would climb into this, they would walk into this like melting pot. And then
2691380	2696820	they would take off, they would, their Polish clothes and put on a suit and tie or like a,
2696820	2701060	like a, and then they would come out the other side and it would be like, like, like, here you are.
2701700	2708660	And it was like this, it's like, you hear, like, to me, that absolutely encapsulates the, the,
2708660	2713620	like the big, the big fucking question. Because when you hear that, you, you, you immediately go,
2713620	2720980	that sounds problematic as far as management. And then, but then you go, also, there's a,
2720980	2725620	there's an asterisk in there in my brain where I go, yeah, but the bad guys are constantly encouraging
2725620	2731460	us to hold on to the differences too. This, there's this thing of like, well, who are the
2731460	2735220	bad guys? Well, women do this, men do that. And it's like, we're starting to recognize that that's
2735220	2740260	like a, that's like a theme, like separating us is how you keep us powerless. Right, right. Well,
2740260	2743620	see, I want to know who are the bad guys? What were you speaking of? Well, I'm talking about
2743620	2748020	Nazis. Have you heard them? Okay. Okay. The government over here. I'm talking about them less
2748020	2752820	and less as I get richer and richer and just want to sneak out quietly. I feel that shit.
2753380	2757620	I just want to die in a fucking lighthouse. Like, well, the fucking atom bombs go off,
2757620	2762900	like a fallout style, baby. Oh, yeah. There's no fighting these old bones.
2763860	2767140	You watch Game of Thrones. I'm the onion knight. I don't got cable, bro.
2769700	2772100	How do you feel like your people feel about the stuff that you do?
2773300	2777300	They're proud, man. Let me ask you this question for like, do you care? Are you out just making
2777300	2782340	content for constant sake, which is also dope? Do you care what your people think? Definitely,
2782740	2786020	definitely. I think that's very important. You know what I'm saying? To an artist, you know,
2787300	2790900	you got to care about what your people think. Yeah. Because otherwise, what are you doing it for?
2791460	2796260	Yeah. You know what I'm saying? As opposed to, you know, doing it for yourself, which is another
2796260	2800900	thing. But like, once you've done that past that level, it's like, is what you're doing really
2800900	2804900	worth it? Right. Is it making an impact? Is it, you know, send a spreading a message,
2804900	2808180	sending a message or something? You know what I mean? Yeah. What do people say to you,
2808180	2811220	like when they, you bump into people, you can recognize for sure.
2811220	2816420	Yeah, man. Even at the taco stands, bro. Can't even order tacos sometimes and shit.
2816420	2822900	Hey, aren't you that guy? That's tough. And I'd be like, uh, uh, where, bro? I just want to test
2822900	2828020	them. Yeah. Aren't you that dude from, uh, no, the videos, Cholo shrine videos? Yeah. Can I take a
2828020	2831780	picture with you, doc? Holding a big ass burrito and shit. Like, you know what I mean?
2834100	2837300	It's the natural, you'd be like, yeah, me and my natural element and shit.
2838180	2839220	No, like a baby, darling.
2843860	2847620	There was a, there was a one backstage you mentioned, because it was like, what is the
2847620	2853220	one thing that, that, that you were made to try through the, through the show that you actually
2853220	2861460	stuck with you. And the answer was sushi. Yes. Yes. Did I ever try sushi? Yeah. Okay. Damn. All
2861460	2865540	right. Yeah. Y'all live up. Y'all probably live on the hipster side of town. You won't,
2865540	2870100	you won't catch no fucking sushi restaurant in Compton, bro. I'll tell you that. But, um,
2870100	2874020	but yeah, that was one of the main things that really stuck with me, man. I, I was really,
2874020	2879540	really, really skeptical for a long time, dude. Cause that shit, I don't know. It does sound,
2879540	2884340	it sounds like it sounds bad. It sounds like the pinnacle of like rich people. Yeah. Of using
2884340	2889700	themselves for no reason. Like eat the seaweed like with raw fish. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and, and,
2889700	2894580	and not to sound culturally racist or nothing like that. I'm expensive. I sound offended,
2894980	2899060	but no, that's all I thought. If it's reverse racism, I think we'd all very much enjoy it.
2899060	2904420	Oh shit. Well, please, please whip us. I don't know. I guess, I guess people would think I love
2904420	2910580	to eat tacos, which I do, but I assume that it was just an Asian cuisine. You know what I mean?
2910580	2913940	For just Asian people. You know what I mean? I thought, yeah, when I saw that, you know,
2913940	2919540	they fuck with like, cause I worked for a Korean dude one time and he brought us some and, um,
2919540	2924180	I think they were California rose. They had no, you know, raw, nothing, but that seaweed,
2924180	2928660	I thought it was fish scale. So I didn't even fuck with it, man. You know what I mean? If you got
2928660	2932900	barbecue though, I can't believe he brought you sushi. Yeah. Right. That's what the fuck I'm
2932900	2937540	saying. What the fuck? They fucked me up with that one. That's why you didn't trust it. Cause
2937540	2941460	you were like, why is a Korean dude bringing me Japanese food? Yeah. If it was warm and looked
2941460	2945940	like it was cooked and looked like, you know, what I eat, like carne asada or whatever,
2945940	2949860	and then I'm with it. I'm sorry. I'm spilling my shit. No, that's okay. You want to, I can fill
2949860	2955780	you up too or help yourself. All right. Is that vodka? Yes, sir. Okay. The homie brought me water,
2955780	2960020	but I thought I'd help myself to some little, please do it. It's for after, you know, cheers,
2960020	2968100	everybody. Cheers, man. Cheers to everybody, man. What, uh, what, what sushi did you like? Um, once,
2968100	2973380	once we tried it, man, and, um, I, I was really open-minded to it and I tried it and I was like,
2973380	2977380	okay, this is pretty good. I guess I'll give it a try next time. I went out, you know what I'm
2977380	2983940	saying? And I had me a little sushi date or whatnot. And I liked that shrimp tempura stuff. Oh yeah.
2983940	2989540	Yeah. Yeah. But you know what I do though, the reason why I like it though is because I make a
2989540	2995220	little pace called what I call crack sauce. Uh-huh. It's very addicting, man. I swear, dude. It's
2995220	3001140	basically low sodium soy sauce with sriracha sauce. Okay. And I dip my sushi roll in it and I just
3001140	3008420	chomp it up, dude. Yeah. Bomb, huh? Like it explodes in my mouth, dude. Like no homo.
3008420	3013300	All right, my bad. It's all right. It's all right. But it's, it's like a party in my mouth,
3013300	3018500	man. And I'm like, oh, damn girl, where you been at all my life? You know, it's like that. Yeah.
3018500	3023620	Sushi's bomb. I love it, man. I love sushi. What's your, all right. Well, what's your dream
3023620	3029860	gig as an actor? Like, uh, can you point at anything that anybody else is doing or like
3029860	3034820	a kind of movie that you'd like to be in? And it doesn't have to be realistic in whatever. Don't,
3034820	3039780	you know, like this is your fantasy. Like, what would you like to be doing as an actor?
3040580	3046180	Ah, shit. In my timeframe, my life, man, uh, I would like to be, if anything,
3046180	3053220	somehow reincarnated to, uh, Antonio Bandera's, uh, fucking career, man. Antonio Bandera is a
3053220	3056900	shit, man. You know what I'm saying? As far as, you know, him being a Latino, I respect his work
3056900	3061540	and all that. He did a lot of good stuff, man. And, um, I always thought he was a good actor,
3061540	3065700	you know, and, you know, somewhere along those lines, you know, he, he never really played the
3065700	3071620	Cholo homie role, like some dudes in, in stand and deliver and, you know, uh, Lou Diamond Phillips,
3071620	3076500	you know, which is a very well-known respected actor in the game. We do have this, I know if my,
3076500	3080980	my ex-girlfriend, who's like a media studies, probably got her PhD by now, she would always
3080980	3086580	blow my mind with all this shit, but she would, I, I imagine if she was sitting here, she'd go,
3086580	3091540	yeah, but there's also this other, the Latin lover thing is like this other way of like,
3091540	3096740	it's like, there's two ways of like oppressing, uh, African-American, like, like, like people,
3096740	3103060	Brandon, I'll explain it to you. Um, uh, it's like, like, there, there's like the,
3103060	3107380	there's like the infantilizing where it's like, oh, look at this little knucklehead. He doesn't
3107380	3112580	mean no harm. And like, then, and then there's the thug thugged out kind of like, uh, oh, careful.
3112580	3116820	Someone's, someone's rolling up. It's like, it's like Eddie Murphy. You always trying to take
3116820	3123300	the big dick thing away though. I've never tried to take that away. There's three things,
3123300	3130180	there's three things, infantilizing, whatever that word was, big dick, and then thug. And the one
3130180	3139860	that upsets me the most is the big dick one. Yeah. Yeah, I never, so stereotypical. Not only have I
3139860	3146820	never questioned that stereotype, neither of you, like the few people do, we just tolerate it,
3146820	3153860	don't we? But, but it's like, but that, that, that, that, that got the, you know, they're like, oh,
3153860	3158900	I'm a Latin, it's all, it's all like a, like a, like a Mandingo thing like that, that idea of
3158900	3167940	sexualizing a, uh, a, a less than privileged, uh, class, like it can feel like it's like awesome,
3167940	3171860	but at the same time, it's like, if you're, if you're into the hobby of problematization,
3172980	3178180	because you had a degree, that's like, you can like trace how it actually, like, but like,
3178180	3182500	but why am I shitting on your dream? You want to be fucking, but Banderis isn't just in movies
3182500	3188580	where he's just, where he's like seducing white honeys, like with a rose in his teeth. He's like,
3188580	3194260	he also like, like, he was like, he was like the, he was the Mexican Bruce Willis,
3194260	3197460	this is what he was. Yeah, basically. Yeah. Basically. Yeah. Basically.
3197460	3203540	He's Spanish though. Okay. Sorry. Racist. No, you're good. You're good. Nationalist. Just
3203540	3208580	shouting it out. Just shouting it out. Can I, okay. So yeah, let me ask like dumb white people
3208580	3215460	questions about Latinx culture. Uh, if, if, if, uh, if you see a Spanish guy, do you guys get in
3215460	3220500	the fight? It's, it's a joke. It's a joke question. No, I'm gonna answer that shit for you, man.
3220500	3226100	Cause you know, it's, it's a yes and a no answer. You know what I'm saying? Because it all depends
3226100	3231300	on the person who it is. You know, I rolled around with homies that they're active and whatever.
3231300	3235060	And we, we're going to Hollywood Boulevard, just chilling and we walking. I'm peeping out the
3235060	3238660	honeys, but this was peeping out the dudes as who's mad dog in this food. Like, what the fuck you
3238660	3243060	looking at? And they want to start some shit. And I'm like, dog, chill, how many? Kicking with the
3243060	3246900	honeys. You see what I'm trying to go to jail tonight, dog. You know what I'm saying? We out
3246900	3251140	here in Hollywood Boulevard and shit, you know? So sometimes it could happen if, if, you know,
3251140	3257300	you're not, you're not with the right people, you know? I think that, okay. Uh, let, let, let,
3257300	3261220	let's dig into the, all right. So I want to dig into this, this fantasy. Like, like maybe we,
3261220	3267060	let's, let's, let's, let's do, let's do the movie where you're the, uh, you're, you're this kind of
3267060	3272900	like, if you were a Banderas type, like what kind of, what's your, what's your, what's your,
3272900	3276740	what is your favorite, uh, not your favorite movie. I hate when people ask me that. What's
3276740	3280820	a movie that you really like? Like, like, that you would be like, man, if I was in that movie,
3280820	3289220	I'd be so excited. Uh, maybe something like, uh, Carlito's ways, Scarface, if it was a Banderas
3289220	3293780	movie, it'd be Desperado. You know, Trejo was in there a while back, you know what I mean? He's
3293780	3300420	the one, you know? And, uh, I like how you say Trejo. Yeah. Yeah. Danny's cool, man. Very Latin X.
3300420	3306180	Oh yeah. What's the, is that new Latin X? I just learned that I was so excited about it.
3306580	3312260	School me on that shit, Danny. You never, have you heard that phrase Latin X instead of, because I
3312260	3318740	think it's, I can, I can help maybe. So you know how there's like Latino or Latina? I think Latin
3318740	3324660	X is just trying to do both of those. Oh, it's like a sci-fi. I think the way people do it.
3325220	3330020	Like gender, gender identification. Well, kind of, it's just like, it's like to say kind of like
3330020	3335460	Latin people like, like, like saying, oh, so you're like, uh, you're like a Latin X comedian or
3335460	3338500	something. Like, like you're just in that community. Like that's how people use it. I
3338500	3346180	think, well, Brenda, do you want to weigh it? Shit. Okay. Oh, I don't know. I'm not going to,
3346180	3354100	I'm not. All I know is Malcolm X. I'm just guessing. Is it true that Malcolm X was developed
3354100	3362740	because there was Malcolm and Malcolm O? Yeah. Malcolm X representation.
3363700	3368900	There had been Malcolm 9. And Malcolm in the middle too. Don't forget that guy.
3370100	3377380	Thank you. But like, um, it, okay. Yeah. Okay. I want to write this movie for you. Okay. Okay.
3377380	3381620	So, uh, let's see. I'm trying to figure out how to do it. Like, I don't want to put you in the spot,
3381620	3388020	but, uh, okay. Um, uh, let's do, let's do like a radio play. Let's come up with a name for your
3388100	3390980	character. It doesn't have to be crazy. Do you want to name them or, uh,
3392180	3398260	or we can, I can name them, man. Uh, about, uh, um,
3398260	3403700	Toko. Toko. I like that. Break it back. Let's make that the name of the movie. Toko.

4379940	4381700	I found it to be a little linear.
4382180	4385060	Like, I'm a story guy myself.
4385060	4387460	Like, I didn't I didn't pick up on enough curvature.
4387460	4388500	But then I guess.
4388500	4391060	Yeah, I wanted to see him eating semen earlier.
4395380	4398420	I think that could have been a nice throw out.
4398420	4400100	I think those are the deleted scenes,
4400100	4401860	that shit was too explicit for content.
4402820	4403300	That's good.
4403300	4405460	I felt like why did this guy even go to law school?
4407140	4408660	And he got fucked over.
4408660	4410260	Clearly, he never once, like,
4410260	4413140	tried to use his law degree to get out of this situation
4413140	4416180	or just practice law to get Toko free.
4416180	4418580	And I feel like his character is called rich white lawyer
4418580	4420980	just to get around all the anti-Semitic issues.
4420980	4421220	Yeah.
4422660	4423060	Yeah.
4423060	4423620	Let's just call it.
4423620	4424340	They were in the boardroom.
4424340	4425620	They're like, let's just call it what it is.
4425620	4425780	Yeah.
4425780	4428580	Because at some point, you become Toko's very best friend.
4429140	4429860	Oh, really?
4429860	4430260	Yeah.
4430260	4432420	In Toko 2, Tuco?
4432420	4432980	Yeah.
4432980	4435140	The story of rich white lawyer.
4435860	4437860	Oh, it's like the rise of Taj.
4439460	4440180	You already know.
4441380	4442340	Exactly like that.
4442340	4442740	Yeah.
4442740	4444420	It's a reverse rise of Taj.
4445860	4448740	I didn't see Van Wilder or Van Wilder to the rise of Taj,
4448740	4449380	so I don't really...
4449940	4453060	I feel like I can figure out those movies from the posters.
4453060	4454180	He really did it.
4454180	4455540	I feel like Taj rises.
4455540	4456260	Yeah, he did.
4457540	4462340	Some say he achieved new heights that Van never could have even dreamed of.
4462340	4465780	Are you saying that in a way, Taj became Van Wildest?
4465780	4466420	Whoa.
4466420	4467300	Holy shit.
4469460	4470580	Holy shit, yeah.
4470580	4471300	Is that what happened?
4471860	4472340	I don't know.
4472340	4473460	You guys are deaf with it.
4473460	4473860	I don't know.
4474980	4476420	I assume that's what happened.
4476420	4477940	A lot of shit happens like that.
4477940	4484180	What's the least cholo-ish, the whitest, I guess, movie that you like?
4484740	4487220	Like, example, 27 Dresses.
4488980	4491220	If that's the answer, you can say it,
4491220	4494340	because then we'll talk about 27 Dresses for like 20 minutes.
4494340	4494980	Yeah, I don't know.
4494980	4496180	I don't know that one.
4496180	4496820	It's pretty good.
4496820	4497540	It's pretty good.
4497540	4498100	Let me see.
4498100	4501060	Let me see real quick off the top of my head within the next five seconds.
4502660	4503620	White chicks.
4503620	4504180	White chicks.
4504180	4504660	Yeah.
4507540	4508740	Nah, I'm fucking with you, man.
4508740	4509460	I'm fucking with you.
4510740	4511060	Shit.
4511060	4511940	It would have to be...
4513780	4515060	Ah, shit.
4515060	4519140	Lockout with Die Hard in Space guy.
4520100	4520580	Nah, it's...
4522340	4525380	Can I add it in with watching it with my chick and shit?
4525380	4525780	Of course.
4525780	4526260	Yeah, yeah.
4527140	4528340	Little notebook, I guess.
4528340	4529460	Yeah, all right.
4529460	4530340	That counts.
4531540	4533140	I kind of cried a little bit on that one.
4534900	4536260	I haven't seen the notebook.
4536260	4538900	Whatever you do, don't be blazed as fuck watching movies, man,
4538900	4539860	because you're going to cry.
4539860	4540900	Yeah, well, wait.
4540900	4542180	You're going to cry, dawg.
4542180	4544420	Have you noticed a theme that will make you cry?
4544420	4549220	Is it like father-son stuff, or is it like underdog stuff, or like...
4549220	4550180	All that stuff, man.
4550180	4552580	All that stuff gets to me, bro, on the real shit.
4552580	4554820	Because it's, you know, it...
4555780	4556340	Oh, shit.
4556340	4556900	What movies...
4556900	4558420	I thought you were about to cry.
4559860	4561300	He paused for a second.
4561300	4563060	God, I forget what it is, man.
4563060	4566420	You know, movies reflect on how you live sometimes in your life.
4566420	4566740	Yeah.
4566740	4567460	You know what I'm saying?
4568500	4572260	If you portray your life in a movie fashion, you're doing this shit all wrong.
4572260	4577620	But if you watch a film and you can relate to it, and it hits home,
4578260	4579380	you know what I'm saying, deep in your heart,
4579380	4581540	like with something you might have been through or something,
4581540	4585620	or whatever it is, you've gone through fucked up relationships,
4585620	4586900	or whatever, you lost a loved one.
4586900	4587540	Whatever, man.
4587540	4590900	Whatever the dramatization is within that film that got to you,
4592500	4594660	it's shit like that that really hits home, man.
4594660	4595540	That gets to me, man.
4595540	4597780	And I'm a big movie buff, you know?
4597780	4601860	And sometimes I'll just be in my zone, people in these movies out, man.
4601860	4605380	And I'm trying to think of the last time I was like bawling.
4605380	4606980	I think it might have been Coco.
4607540	4612260	Like, I'm not trying to, I'm not bringing that up to score a culture punch.
4612260	4613140	Oh, no, no.
4613140	4613700	I feel you.
4613700	4614420	I teared a little on Coco.
4614420	4617940	I think it was like toward the end of Coco, I started fucking losing it.
4617940	4620020	I teared a little on Coco, man.
4620020	4623380	And it was unexpected, because at the beginning of the first 20 minutes of Coco,
4623380	4625860	I was like, this shit's more complicated than Phantom Menace.
4625860	4626500	What the fuck?
4627220	4628580	The fuck are you talking about?
4628580	4632660	You got to be a skeleton by morning, but on Tuesday if no one has your picture on a bench.
4633140	4635140	Yeah, yeah.
4635140	4638420	But it did turn out to be quite simple.
4638420	4640660	And then I actually was very profound.
4641540	4643140	I was just fucking sobbing.
4643140	4645780	I can't even actually remember why I was crying.
4647780	4655220	Like, my girlfriend will just fucking, she'll just sob like a cartoon at anything.
4655220	4660500	Like, anything that's like, well, I don't want to cheapen her.
4660500	4662660	It has to be sincerely done.
4662660	4663540	But I'm just saying, like-
4663540	4665060	She cried to sausage party and shit.
4665060	4666900	Like, well, not quite that.
4666900	4667540	No.
4667540	4670340	But anything where the director was like,
4670340	4674580	you know, if I had it my way, you'd be crying right now.
4674580	4675940	Like, in a real sincere way.
4675940	4682260	Like, Cody will, she'll actually, unpredictably, she'll actually be sobbing.
4682980	4686100	Did you see, you didn't see, there's no way you saw.
4686100	4689060	Did you see a ghost story with Casey Affleck?
4689140	4690660	He's wearing a sheet, the whole movie.
4690660	4692500	And then you got to watch a girl eat a pie.
4692500	4693460	Is this a weird movie?
4693460	4694660	I've seen The Six Ants.
4695220	4695940	It's pretty similar.
4695940	4696660	It's kind of like that.
4696660	4698980	But yeah, that's a movie-
4698980	4700900	I got a lot of catching up to do on movies.
4700900	4703300	That was the most, well, this movie, like, nobody's seen it.
4703300	4706660	But like, it's the most, like, I was the most unexpected.
4706660	4712020	Like, it's like, Casey Affleck is just a dude who, he's like, he dies.
4712020	4715460	And then he, the gimmick of the movie is that he's just under a sheet,
4715460	4717940	like Charlie Brown, like, like, like, like the whole movie.
4717940	4721460	And it's like, the movie waits for you to like, get over that and be like,
4721460	4722340	this is corny.
4722340	4724260	But then it's just like, he's just hanging out in the background.
4724260	4725380	He's in a sheet.
4725380	4729940	And then like, you, there's a scene where his girlfriend, like,
4730820	4731940	he's just watching her.
4732500	4735940	And she eats this pie that somebody gave her.
4735940	4737060	She's alone.
4737060	4738980	And it's like, the camera doesn't cut.
4738980	4741700	And then you just watch her eat a fucking pie.
4741700	4743460	Because she's like, binging.
4743460	4745540	But then, and then I think she goes and pukes it up or whatever.
4745540	4748740	But it's just like, sort of like, it just, it's like two minutes, like,
4748740	4750740	and people who don't like the movie, they're like,
4751700	4753140	they immediately leap to the scene.
4753140	4755060	Like, I want to watch somebody eat a pie.
4755060	4756180	Casey Affleck in a sheet.
4756180	4756900	What are you doing to me?
4757460	4758820	And I don't fault those people.
4758820	4759860	I'm not saying those people.
4759860	4760900	You don't get it, man.
4761780	4763700	Three seconds to the movie, then change the shit.
4763700	4766340	But the crazy thing is, if you're on the other side of it,
4766340	4769460	and the only reason I was, is because Cody started crying.
4769460	4771300	And then I was like, why is Cody crying?
4771300	4773540	And then we paused the movie and that's my girlfriend.
4773540	4774340	She's got a guy's name.
4775140	4777540	My middle name is a female's name.
4778100	4779460	Oh, yeah.
4779460	4779780	All right.
4779780	4781780	So we're like, we were basically like family.
4781780	4782420	Yeah, we're the same.
4783060	4785940	We're the same, a little different, but same, same, you know.
4785940	4788900	I started thinking about what, for the first time in my life,
4788900	4792900	I started thinking about, instead of thinking about how sad it would be to die,
4792900	4796660	as in, like, how bummed I would be to not be able to live life anymore.
4796660	4797160	Yeah.
4797780	4798820	I'd never get no more life.
4799460	4807140	Like, I was like, I started getting scared that I would die because of the,
4807140	4810260	like, I was like, oh my God, what if you had to watch your,
4810900	4813780	the person that you loved, cope with your,
4813780	4815700	and I know there's been other movies about that.
4815700	4816580	Like, like.
4816580	4817540	What movies may come?
4817540	4818100	Yeah, exactly.
4818100	4818900	Robert Williams.
4818900	4819380	Yeah.
4819380	4820980	Like, I know those never affected me.
4820980	4823860	Like, I never, I watched those and I go like, eh, grown up shit.
4823860	4824980	Like, I don't, I don't know.
4824980	4826500	This like, hipster thing got to me.
4826500	4828020	It's like, Casey Affleck's on a sheet.
4828020	4829060	Maybe it disarmed me.
4829060	4829620	Like, like.
4829620	4830900	You just cold-hearted, Dan.
4831460	4831860	I don't know.
4831860	4833300	You're just fucking cold-hearted, though.
4833300	4834420	You don't got no love, though.
4834420	4838020	I think I just needed to have, like, a relationship with somebody that was,
4838020	4838980	like, so cold.
4838980	4842500	Like, she started sobbing and then she's like, I'm gonna pause it, make us some drinks.
4842500	4843940	And then it was like, that's great.
4843940	4844420	It goes deep.
4844420	4844980	It goes deep.
4844980	4846500	And then it was like, what's she crying about?
4846500	4848900	And then I was like, maybe we'll figure it out while she's making drinks.
4848900	4859460	It was truly like, and honestly, ever since then, it's been several years now,
4859460	4864020	I still think about that scene from that movie when I think about death.
4864900	4871460	That's my new, if the director of that movie knew that they had accomplished that,
4871460	4873060	would they be proud?
4873060	4873540	Ashamed?
4873540	4873940	I don't know.
4874740	4875620	I don't know what they mean.
4875620	4877380	I'm sure they would have been proud, man.
4877380	4879380	It's only the chosen few that can catch it.
4879940	4884420	So what would you, as an actor, would you really like to, like, do you'd like to play,
4884420	4888900	like, would that be your ultimate fantasy is knowing that you did something that
4890100	4893460	somebody out there, even if it's one person, because of your performance,
4895700	4897140	it fucked up their whole brain.
4897140	4898660	It changed their whole life.
4898660	4900340	Like, that would be the brass ring, right?
4900900	4904260	Well, that would fuck me up if I fucked up somebody else and shit like that.
4904260	4907620	But if I helped change their life in some kind of way, then, you know,
4907620	4910500	I've served my purpose in life, you know?
4910500	4913300	But yeah, like, that'll be dope, man.
4913300	4916500	Like, that's actually what I really strive for and live for.
4916500	4918980	You know, a lot of the times what I do with my music, you know?
4919860	4920500	Music?
4920500	4921060	Yeah.
4921060	4922340	I produce, man.
4922340	4923460	Drop a beat.
4923460	4924100	No, I'm kidding.
4925940	4926900	Why? Why are you kidding?
4928900	4930500	Because he may be into bluegrass.
4931620	4932420	I love bluegrass.
4932980	4933860	I love bluegrass.
4934500	4935700	I love all kind of music.
4935700	4937460	But his hat says dope.
4939140	4940420	And he's got a chain on.
4941380	4943140	Do you use SoundCloud?
4943140	4944820	Some stereotypes are real.
4946580	4948980	This motherfucker freestyle, probably.
4950500	4952340	What's with the Morrissey thing?
4955540	4956420	How is that real?
4956420	4958100	Like, I don't understand that at all.
4958100	4958580	Morrissey.
4958580	4963380	The Morrissey thing, like, that's a genuine Cholo thing,
4963460	4966020	if I can use that word outside the context of the title of your show.
4966020	4966820	Like, fuck it.
4966820	4975780	Like, Latinx, Los Angeles dudes, like, being so fucking big into Morrissey,
4975780	4977380	you're not familiar with that stereotype?
4978180	4979300	Nah, to be honest with you.
4979860	4981460	I'm not familiar with the stereotype.
4981460	4983380	I think there's a band called Morrissey, ain't there?
4983380	4983860	Yeah.
4983860	4984100	Yeah.
4984100	4985460	So a lot of guys like him.
4985460	4986260	Like, I guess.
4987700	4989860	It's the weirdest thing because he's the hipsters, bro.
4989860	4990580	They look like us.
4990580	4991140	That's what I'm saying.
4991140	4993220	They adopted our culture a little bit, you know?
4994020	4995780	There's like a rockabilly crossover.
4995780	4998420	So it's low riders, rockabilly 50s type.
4998420	4998900	Oh, really?
4998900	4999540	Is that it?
4999540	5001780	I heard of some shit called Cholo Goth, too.
5001780	5003300	I don't know if that falls in the category.
5003940	5004980	Could be, you know.
5004980	5005300	Yeah.
5005300	5005860	I don't know.
5005860	5006100	Yeah.
5006100	5007140	These folks are crazy, though.
5007140	5007780	They're fucking...
5007780	5012900	But a lot of the lucha of other people are Morrissey fan type situation.
5012900	5013460	Because I couldn't pick a...
5013460	5016260	I mean, I was like, I know Morrissey from Impressions.
5016260	5018260	Like, I know Dana Gould's impression of Morris.
5023540	5025300	He's like, he couldn't sound more white.
5025300	5027300	I think, isn't he literally British?
5027300	5027620	Yeah.
5027620	5028100	Yeah.
5028100	5028900	Like, he's not...
5030020	5031060	It's kind of just funny.
5031060	5031540	It's like...
5031540	5036500	He just sounded like he was trying to sound like a creepy ass Santa Claus and shit on
5036500	5038500	December evening, the night before Christmas.
5042500	5044660	Yeah, I mean, that's what I did.
5044660	5045780	I was just fucking with you, Dan.
5045780	5046500	No, it's okay.
5047220	5047620	Jesus.
5047620	5048980	No hard feelings, my boy.
5048980	5049860	No hard feelings.
5049860	5050820	Cholo to Cholo.
5050820	5052180	Cholo to Cholo?
5052180	5054340	You're not making me an honorary Cholo.
5054340	5055300	Man, we're going to...
5055300	5057140	We're going to Cholo-fy you in the backstage.
5057140	5058500	Y'all want to see this cat Cholo-fy?
5058500	5060100	We got to Cholo-fy Dan, I think.
5060660	5061700	We're going to take Dan.
5062580	5066420	We're going to take Dan backstage and have our Cholo experts work with him
5068580	5071220	to create a brand new look that'll say,
5071220	5072340	Hey, Papi.
5074020	5076420	Watch out for the new Cholo Dan and shit.
5076420	5077300	You know what I'm saying?
5077300	5078660	Would we have to shave him?
5078660	5081620	Like, what would we do to make Dan...
5081620	5082660	Nah, we ain't got to shave him.
5082660	5084260	We'll let him keep his masculinity.
5084260	5085380	His masculinity.
5087620	5090100	And then we'll just throw on some bandanas, you know what I'm saying?
5090100	5092100	Like, Tupac, you know what I'm saying?
5092100	5095380	Throw on some Sharpie, three dots, like the crazy life, a little teardrop.
5095380	5097860	But can we give him something that is just uniquely Dan?
5098820	5101220	Not Tupac, not anything you've seen before.
5101220	5105220	We'll tie him up with a little Rick and Morty right here on the side of the guy and shit.
5105220	5106180	Crying and shit.
5106180	5111060	It's three dots, but then when you look at them, they're like keys on a typewriter.
5111060	5111560	Okay.
5112260	5113220	There you go.
5113220	5114420	Okay, Matto.
5114420	5115700	Whatever you want, Dan. We got to come home.
5115700	5117620	Like, you know what they call me, I say?
5117620	5119460	They call me the TV writer, homie.
5120740	5121780	Oreli.
5121780	5124420	I'll serialize your ass for Netflix.
5125300	5127940	I'll write about you in my next fucking series, homies.
5127940	5129940	It's a new generation, a new marketplace.
5129940	5131220	It's all about streaming now.
5131220	5133140	I don't even need to do modular.
5133140	5134980	I eat tacos at home, I say.
5134980	5137060	I'll tell you one story over 10 episodes.
5137060	5138260	Make everyone watch it.
5138260	5138900	There you go.
5139460	5140020	There you go.
5141380	5143060	Serialize that shit, bro.
5144420	5145460	Serialize that shit.
5145460	5147220	You're officially a motherfucking thug.
5148260	5151140	Yesterday's bad movie is today's hit series.
5151140	5153220	We got to make it 10 episodes, bro.
5153220	5153540	Yeah.
5154180	5157220	Groundhog Day meets a fucking tire shop.
5158660	5161140	We got to certify you, though, with a handshake, my G.
5162260	5163460	Certify you with the handshake on me.
5163460	5164020	Certify him.
5165700	5166500	No, not you.
5166500	5167140	He's fucking up.
5167140	5167700	Oh, no, you're not.
5167700	5168660	Strike one, Dan.
5169220	5170100	You're going to follow up.
5170180	5172180	Well, I get three strikes at least, don't I?
5172180	5172820	You sure do.
5172820	5175060	Or are we cholifying baseball now, too?
5175940	5177220	Nah, this ain't baseball, homie.
5177220	5179060	You're going to the pan for this one, bro.
5179060	5181060	I mean, are you ever going to even tell me what to do?
5181060	5181380	One.
5182180	5182980	One.
5182980	5183460	Two.
5183460	5184260	Two.
5184260	5184900	And the pound.
5184900	5185300	I'm three.
5185300	5185700	Oh, OK.
5185700	5187060	That's not hard.
5187060	5187540	Let me do that.
5187540	5188260	Let me do that fast.
5188260	5189540	It's an instant classic.
5189540	5189860	One.
5189860	5190340	Oh, shit.
5190340	5190820	OK.
5190820	5191540	Oh, no.
5191540	5192500	Strike two.
5192500	5193620	Strike two for Dan.
5193620	5194100	All right.
5194100	5194580	Oh, no.
5194580	5195300	Here we go.
5195300	5196660	Third time's the charm, and shit.
5196660	5197460	All right.
5198340	5200340	Oh, man.
5200340	5202420	I want to be casual about it.
5202420	5202900	There you go.
5202900	5205860	I feel like getting it wrong should have penalties.
5205860	5207300	I just want to be, OK.
5207300	5209060	He's about to fall off.
5210020	5210520	OK.
5212500	5216100	Gar-san, give me another of the brisket sandwich,
5216100	5218180	and I've got a cholo friend coming by.
5218180	5220740	Yeah, I'm going to have to have you talk to me.
5220740	5221220	OK, OK.
5221220	5221940	I'm going to have to have you talk to me.
5221940	5223300	I'll have you talk to me a little bit, dog.
5223300	5223940	Oh, hey.
5223940	5224820	What's up, homie?
5224820	5225380	Choco.
5225380	5226180	All right, we'll scrap this.
5226180	5226680	Shit.
5227700	5228500	What's up, dog?
5228500	5228980	Fucking yeah.
5228980	5229480	Yeah.
5229480	5229980	Yeah.
5229980	5230980	Yeah.
5230980	5232480	Yay.
5232480	5233060	Yeah.
5233060	5235700	So anyways, about this new financing plan.
5235700	5238020	Where you fucking go?
5238020	5241060	Now what you got to do is pretend you got arthritis,
5241060	5244100	my boy, and you're throwing up gang signs, homie.
5244100	5244900	Damn.
5244900	5246580	Just pretend you got arthritis and you're
5246580	5248820	throwing up gang signs, dog.
5248820	5254620	That seems like a Paul Rodriguez bit from, like,
5254620	5255340	I don't know, dog.
5255340	5256700	I just know you got arthritis.
5256940	5258980	Gee, homie, you're throwing up gang signs, dog.
5258980	5263340	Yeah, I think that might be, like, a stand-up bit from.
5263340	5264980	Fucking Felipe?
5264980	5269700	I always worry about, whenever, regardless of the culture,
5269700	5273180	because a lot of guys have that thing where you grip the hand
5273180	5275300	and do that thing, I always worry about my fingernail
5275300	5276380	length.
5276380	5277620	Oh.
5277620	5279060	Like, if you're a real man's man,
5279060	5281060	you're not necessarily manicured.
5281060	5282780	And then I'm always worried about,
5282780	5285780	am I digging into this guy's soft tissues
5285820	5288540	with my fucking gross fingernails?
5288540	5289340	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5289340	5290780	Watch out for that one, man.
5290780	5293580	You got to have nice, I mean, you
5293580	5296340	ain't got to have nice-ass fucking manicure fingernails
5296340	5296860	or whatever.
5296860	5298980	As long as they ain't going to shank me, bro.
5298980	5301220	I don't understand why these things keep fucking growing.
5301220	5303620	Don't you think they should have come out with a pill by now,
5303620	5305620	just make these things stop growing?
5305620	5306620	Yeah.
5306620	5309300	Yeah, but I think if you can't do it without the pill, man,
5309300	5311020	you're just lazy as fuck.
5311020	5314660	What about your toenails, though?
5314780	5318740	Toenails, it's like to be old and to hunch over
5318740	5320380	and you've got the thing, and it's like 10 toenails.
5320380	5322420	You ever seen the dude with the long-ass toenails?
5322420	5323020	Yeah, me.
5323020	5324500	Me.
5324500	5326460	No, no, because I put it off as long as possible,
5326460	5328460	because I'm like, are you kidding with this again?
5328460	5329620	It just keeps coming out.
5329620	5330460	It's just crazy.
5330460	5333180	It's fucking insane.
5333180	5334340	What am I doing this for?
5334340	5335020	Where's it coming from?
5335020	5336100	There's got to be a pill.
5336100	5340940	Do you use scissors or head slippers for your shit?
5340940	5344300	Obviously, it's like the nail clippers that you get.
5345100	5346500	You can go get that done.
5346500	5347500	You can go get that done.
5347500	5348340	Go get it.
5348340	5348860	No, yeah.
5348860	5353100	Well, that's they had the Cholos tried Chinese foot massage
5353100	5355300	or whatever, and the one guy was like, that one's touching my feet.
5355300	5356140	That's how I felt.
5356140	5357340	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5357340	5358500	No one's touching my feet.
5358500	5362340	Like, I don't I won't get like a professional back rub or anything.
5362340	5367340	Like, I the same way I would never I would never avail myself
5367340	5371980	of a sex worker is because where other other men would would would
5371980	5376740	think, oh, I I just I just you're my bitch now.
5376740	5380780	I just make it all into like, well, they're they have they've got a metric.
5380780	5383140	Like, they know how much acne I have on my back.
5383140	5384740	Like, like they've seen every back.
5384740	5387260	So now they're going to be like comparing.
5387260	5391300	So I don't want this guy who got a fucking land over here.
5391300	5392300	You got a mountain.
5392300	5394580	You got what city is this is shit.
5394580	5396380	Yeah, I got a lot of shit to work.
5396380	5398500	Yeah, I feel I feel the insecurity.
5398500	5402540	The thing about this, though, is once you get the feet done a bunch of times,
5402940	5406180	I wish I could crash that threshold where I would just go into a place
5406380	5408580	three times and just be like, do my feet.
5409380	5410300	That would be the crazy.
5410300	5411380	That would be crazier.
5411380	5414540	You don't have to talk to him like that.
5414540	5416740	They know they know what you're going in there for, bro.
5417660	5418540	Do my feet.
5418540	5421020	Let me explain why.
5421020	5422620	Let me explain why I'm here.
5422620	5425060	Well, because you know what I would really do is I would be like,
5425740	5429540	hey, I and they would be like, you want me to do your feet?
5429540	5430500	Like they would yell at me.
5430500	5432900	And I guess the next time I go, I'm like, do my feet.
5432900	5433860	And they'd be like, you don't have to yell.
5433860	5435540	And I'm like, see, I don't like this.
5435540	5439020	Oh, you're not you're not going to they're not going to harass you.
5439260	5440860	They're going to guide you over to a chair.
5440860	5441980	You go. You can go with Cody.
5441980	5443780	You get to get your feet.
5443780	5445420	You do this all the time.
5445420	5447100	I don't know. Jeff does now.
5447100	5449940	I heard I heard in downtown L.A.
5449940	5451340	Man, I do my careful.
5451340	5454260	If you go do that, you got to be careful which one you go to
5454260	5456180	because I heard in downtown L.A.
5456180	5457940	Do my feet could mean something else.
5457940	5459900	I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.
5459900	5461540	That might be better. I will tell you.
5461540	5464500	I don't know. You don't get ingrowns that way.
5464500	5467220	So you can you can have somebody do your nails or you can go to a doctor
5467220	5468980	and then he's got to cut your nails out and shit.
5468980	5471020	I'll tell you, I don't want to have claws, my boy.
5471020	5473420	Yeah, for fucking sake, this for a brag.
5473420	5478660	But I don't think I don't get any of those problems because I have the one problem,
5478660	5481740	which is that they grow at one inch a day. Yeah.
5481740	5484380	So there's no ingrowing. There's no things out.
5484380	5488460	I have one problem alone, which is just like, do they ever.
5488460	5491540	Freddy Krueger feet like, do they ever cut through your shoes?
5491540	5497100	Yeah, they are constantly running up against the fucking like physics of our world.
5497100	5503740	And I and I the only I go down to get the food at the door.
5503740	5509620	And if I'm not wearing socks and I'm like, I'm just like, don't look down like,
5509620	5514340	you know, like my toenails, like it clicks like a dog's feet.
5514340	5520780	Oh, yeah, they grow very quickly by my definition.
5520780	5524580	So you've got to keep away a certain length of everything because otherwise,
5524580	5526340	you know, you're going to fucking step on it.
5526340	5528940	I mean, or poke through it or shrink that shit.
5528940	5532820	Well, it's just I'll say, I'll say the fact that like when I'm in the bed,
5532820	5538260	if I'm naked in the bedsheets, the only the only thing that doesn't have to do
5538300	5540500	with vanity like, oh, it looks gross.
5540500	5543700	It's unbecoming. You look like a monster.
5543700	5545380	Who wants to look like a monster?
5545380	5547700	You know, my audience does.
5547700	5550500	OK, but like we come here to celebrate.
5550500	5555340	But but but but but the the one thing is like the the bedsheets.
5555340	5559220	And then you're like, you like move your weight around and you're naked.
5559220	5561780	And you should be the best moment of your life.
5561780	5565460	Naked like fucking like I love my life.
5565460	5567900	I'm going to play some Fallout 4.
5567900	5570900	Like and you're just like and then like you're you're you get this weird
5570900	5574100	reminder that you have a monster toenail because it like drags along
5574100	5577620	your thousand thread count sheet and like makes a sound or something.
5577620	5579460	You're like, I'm a monster. I'm a monster.
5579460	5582780	Do you find yourself having to buy sheets constantly?
5582780	5585460	I don't know the sheets I take out that way.
5585460	5587780	I just I feel like I just feel like John Merrick.
5589380	5590180	That's great.
5590180	5592980	Well, you should be one of the X-Men then, bro.
5592980	5595180	Well, John Merrick was for his time.
5595180	5596780	I guess he probably was like an X-Men.
5596780	5600020	But like before they really appreciated them.
5600700	5604140	Like, like, yeah, that's just like, no, it can be rough.
5604180	5606980	You also got to be cut. There's got to be a pill.
5606980	5608860	Your girl don't hook you up one boy.
5608860	5611700	Hook me up with what? Like, like, she don't men or a pedicure.
5612220	5613740	Like, like, well, she's offered.
5613740	5615500	She says like all women do.
5615500	5617220	They go like, well, let's go get a pedicure.

5655500	5657940	This next segment is called Cholo's get hate mail.
5660380	5663460	One of my most embarrassing moments, I still remember, it was like,
5663460	5665820	I was like, it's got to be 20 years ago now.
5666420	5668580	First girlfriends, I moved to L.A.
5668580	5673220	Like I and I was unemployed and she was very employed
5673220	5678100	and I was staying in her apartment and I'll just I'll never forget the phone call
5678260	5682260	like because I would stay at her place and then I would like eventually,
5682260	5684180	you know, she'd go to work at eight in the morning
5684180	5687740	and then I'd fucking lounge around and watch go bots and smoke a ball
5687740	5692140	and then like fucking head back to my apartment and think about like go bots
5692140	5695380	or whatever the fuck my job, what I thought my job was.
5695700	5700500	And and then one and then her like calling me
5700500	5704380	because we didn't have texts and anything back then and just and her being like,
5704380	5707780	did you clip your toenails at my place this morning and be going?
5707780	5709420	Yeah, it's like, did you do it?
5709420	5710380	I'm saving them.
5710380	5712740	Did you do it on a paper plate like
5714180	5717620	on the couch like while you were watching TV?
5717620	5720060	Because, yeah, you get the idea.
5720060	5722060	Like you forgot a step.
5722060	5726740	And I was I still to this day, I'm just like, you fucking go.
5726940	5728420	Can you imagine?
5728420	5730660	How could she ever touch my penis again?
5731700	5733900	Oh, yeah, I did it to my roommate
5734700	5739540	and I cut them in the fucking shower and it had been like Hulk growth.
5740300	5746460	They were like long and discolored, you know, like, like old slave toes.
5746500	5750420	Right. And I left just a fucked up pile
5751100	5756260	and the look on this dude's face, I thought it was a girl.
5756420	5758020	There was a dude.
5758020	5761140	He looked at me and he was it was like, why would you do this to me?

5777340	5778660	I wish I was so deep.
5778660	5781300	It was just this lovable look.
5781300	5785180	I'm I'm the first person to celebrate the other.
5786780	5789140	I'm not a traditional man's man.
5789140	5792620	Well, why would you do this to me?
5792620	5795460	Paul Giamatti.

5966540	5967700	What did I miss the thing?
5967700	5970060	I said, you're you're much more of the Paul Giamatti type.
5971460	5973700	Less Adam Levine deserving.
5973700	5974980	How weird.
5974980	5976620	OK, where's the idea?

5989700	5991020	Softer sounds difficult.
5991020	5992780	That sounds like turning it into string cheese.
5992780	5995020	I don't like like like like like pliable.
5995020	5996500	Now it's. Yeah, I'm sorry.
5996500	5998500	By the way, this has got to be triggering softer.
5998500	6001260	That way, you don't got to use hedge clippers.
6001260	6003980	But I just truly like I just don't want to be a monster.
6003980	6006980	And I just like I have these fucking horrible.

6007940	6010220	And I got to cut the shit when it's wet.
6010220	6013380	There's got to be a way if there's got to be a way to become rich enough.
6013420	6016060	There's going to be a thing from Skymall where you just put your foot
6016060	6019340	on inside a little thing that's like a robocop sock.
6019380	6021140	And it just goes like.

6035940	6037580	look at those square toenails.
6037580	6038780	Those look ridiculous.

6041340	6043900	I'm like, yeah, but they're not monster claws.
6043900	6046260	I don't know. You can't cut meat with the motherfuckers no more.
6046260	6047460	I'm six feet tall.
6047460	6050940	I have a prodigious belly, a gut belly thing.
6050940	6053380	What do you call it? A belly.

6055340	6058260	It's the idea is you get a you get a bend over.
6058540	6063860	I feel my intestines like squishing, like like I'm like, it hurts.
6063860	6066700	It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
6066700	6069260	I'm like I'm like I'm like contorting myself.
6069260	6070700	I'm like, it hurts.
6070700	6072620	I can't I can't let me down for so long.
6072620	6074340	I got to do it 10 times.
6074340	6077100	But like three, three times on the big toe.
6077100	6079140	And then it's like I'm just like clip, clip, clip.
6079140	6080220	And it's so hard.
6080220	6082980	I don't know if this is the biggest thing in my life.
6082980	6086580	If we if we could if we could figure this out.
6087180	6089860	Well, luckily, Dan, you just got to get over that shit
6089860	6092500	because, you know, you can't get over this shit.
6092500	6093900	That's not a solution.
6093900	6095780	And just go get a damn pedicure, man.

6276340	6277380	Like, how did you put that crew together?
6277380	6280100	Mostly people from Los Angeles or people from all over.
6280100	6284180	Yeah, mainly from L.A., the greater L.A. area.
6284180	6287700	You know, I'm from Compton, you know, so was it a crew that you always rolled with
6287700	6292020	or did you find people, you know, via this person or stuff you had worked on before?
6293380	6296740	Yeah. Every time I go on set, I'm always trying to network with somebody, you know,
6297300	6300820	because what I can't find out, I'm a hustler, man.
6300820	6303140	You know, I network with a lot of people.
6303140	6304180	I talk to a lot of people.
6304180	6305220	I'm a humble dude.
6305220	6309060	You know, it doesn't really matter what it is that you do or what you can do for me.
6309060	6312180	I just chop it up with people and then once you get to know them,
6312180	6316740	you know, once they open those up those doors and you tie with them with that person,
6316740	6319140	then you start to really network and collab, you know.
6319140	6322340	So I try not to put all my eggs in one basket.
6322340	6322820	Yeah.
6322820	6323620	You know what I mean?
6323620	6325460	Is her mano something that somebody brought to you?
6325460	6326660	Did you already have that?
6326660	6328340	Like you had already been trying to make this movie.
6330020	6335060	It was it was brought to my attention and I feel so blessed and I'm very thankful that it did
6335060	6339380	because of the, you know, relationship bond that I built with this independent company.
6339380	6339940	Who is it with?
6339940	6340820	Can you name that company?
6340820	6342020	Yeah. Los Feliz Films.
6342020	6344100	And they are here in the audience right right here somewhere.
6344100	6344420	I don't know.
6345380	6347060	Danny's fucking lights up bright as fuck.
6348500	6349540	Los Feliz Films.
6349540	6350180	You know what I'm saying?
6350180	6351300	It's called Hermanos.
6351300	6352900	They're the producers of the film.
6354660	6357780	And yeah, we plan on branching out on a lot of stuff, man.
6357780	6364500	It's something that, like I said it before, it's like divine intervention almost.
6364500	6367380	Because Cholo's try almost didn't happen, you know.
6367380	6372420	And because it did happen the way it did happen, it's broken a lot of stereotypes.
6372980	6377220	We pretty much, Cholo has became a household name.
6377940	6378740	You know what I mean?
6378740	6382420	So now, you know, we're doing what we're doing with the try stuff.
6382420	6384420	We're doing films, you know, we're doing TV.
6385460	6388260	I produce music, engineering music, you know.
6388260	6388980	What kind of music?
6389540	6390900	Hip-hop is my core.
6390900	6391300	Okay.
6391300	6391860	Yeah, you know.
6391860	6394980	But as a musician, as an artist, I listen to everything, man.
6394980	6395380	Everything.
6395380	6397860	Even the shit that anybody else might not like.
6397860	6398260	Yeah.
6398260	6400900	I listen to everything because I'm trying to find that new sound.
6400900	6405620	As a producer of hip-hop, have you heard anything that I've done?
6406740	6408980	Yes, I have, Dan.
6408980	6410020	Why, yes, I have.
6411300	6411860	What do you think?
6413060	6416340	Hey, I think you need to be on Wild'N Out or something, man.
6416340	6420340	I need to have you on there or something to get these freestyles cracking with these fools
6420340	6421620	and battle them out, man.
6421620	6422420	Okay.
6422420	6423380	He's battle ready?
6423380	6424420	Is he battle ready?
6424420	6426500	I think he's battle ready, man.
6426500	6430740	I think he might be battling with himself, but he's battle ready, man.
6430740	6431300	Should I battle?
6431300	6432260	Let's battle.
6432260	6433220	Let me battle Brandon.
6433860	6435220	Oh, shit.
6435220	6436500	I have to lose.
6436500	6437380	It's the, it's called.
6437380	6440020	No, no, don't, don't, don't lose on purpose.
6442420	6443300	Oh, shit.
6443300	6444020	It's kind of like print.
6444020	6444580	Damn.
6444580	6445060	Oh.
6446100	6447460	Bring your vocals back.
6447460	6448500	Don't be too tight.
6448500	6451700	I want your vagina and your curly hair.
6451700	6454500	I've got your Minnesota vagina.
6454500	6455460	Make a pair.
6457620	6461220	Have you ever fallen asleep on a mustard cloud and danced with a purple bear?
6463220	6463700	Oh.
6464740	6466260	I didn't, I didn't, wait, I didn't even hear it.
6466260	6467860	He's already, okay, wait, wait, wait.
6467860	6470580	Yo, yo, why you burning me so fast?
6470580	6471700	Why you rapping so fast?
6471700	6472980	Did you try to topaz?
6473700	6474980	Stole your mama's topaz.
6474980	6476580	They're going to bring an ass blast.
6476580	6480020	I should do all my freestyles in the voice of Prince.
6480020	6481220	Or would that make any sense?
6482340	6482660	Oh.
6484500	6486740	Hey, I like that shit you did with John Mayer, man.
6486740	6487700	That was dope, man.
6487700	6488580	Yeah, that was dope.
6488580	6491380	You mean having John Mayer freestyle.
6491380	6491860	Yeah.
6491860	6494260	No, but that little beat, that little beat y'all did,
6494260	6497380	and then the freestyle that y'all did, that shit was hard, homie.
6497380	6499060	He got soulful in the middle there.
6499060	6501860	There was like a, he had like a run where he was like, yeah.
6501860	6502420	Oh, yeah.
6502420	6509860	He was truly, he was unafraid in expressing his fear of being John Mayer.
6509860	6510340	Oh, yeah.
6510340	6510980	I really like that.
6510980	6512580	Yeah, he was feeling it, man.
6512580	6513380	He was feeling it.
6513380	6514500	And you were feeling it too, man.
6514500	6515460	I love that shit, man.
6515460	6516740	I've never felt anything.
6516740	6517220	Man.
6518260	6518740	I swear I was like-
6518740	6520020	That's for pussies.
6520020	6521140	Will you shout out your group?
6522340	6524100	If you have a couple groups that we should listen to,
6524100	6525380	you produce them right now.
6525380	6526100	Is there anything hot?
6526740	6528260	I mainly produce for myself.
6528260	6528900	Okay.

6546420	6548180	Childless, chillin' with Dan.

6567220	6568020	Maybe four.
6568020	6569940	I'ma kick your motherfucking ass out the door
6569940	6570980	if you want to talk shit.
6570980	6572020	If you want to be a bitch
6572020	6573140	and if your ass want to trip,
6573140	6574180	then you can suck my dick
6574180	6575380	and I don't give a shit.
6575380	6576740	You still a trick.
6576740	6577780	You a fucking dick.
6577780	6578660	You a fucking prick.
6579620	6580580	That's just how I feel.
6581540	6582820	I don't really care for real.
6583860	6585140	Unless you're paying me money,
6585140	6586740	but this shit might sound bad to you,
6586740	6587700	but to me, it's funny.
6588500	6589140	Yeah.
6589140	6589860	Dan Harmon.
6590820	6591140	Yeah.
6591780	6592260	Yeah.
6593220	6594580	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6594580	6596020	Cholo tribe, baby.
6596020	6597700	Big talk from the West Coast.
6597700	6598660	Just a little something.
6598660	6599620	Just a little something.
6599620	6601620	Just a little something on a beatbox tip.
6601620	6601940	Yeah.
6601940	6602580	I mean, yeah.
6602580	6603460	I got a little something.
6604900	6606180	I may or may not have gone
6606180	6607620	to an all-black middle school.
6608740	6609380	How'd you know?
6610820	6613620	Let's just say if you tell me a name,
6613620	6616340	I can add sir and a lot to it
6617220	6619060	and give you a rapping name.
6620420	6622020	Magic marker on any locker.
6623060	6623460	Damn.
6624900	6625780	Fucking word.
6625780	6626580	He was a tagger.
6627460	6629060	Nah, I wasn't really a tagger.
6629060	6629780	Oh, shit.
6629780	6631700	I was raised around the tagging culture.
6632500	6632980	Oh, yeah.
6634420	6636340	I grew up in a middle school
6636340	6638980	where sharpies and magic markers
6639620	6640740	they were contraband.
6640740	6641860	You ever heard of streaks?
6642900	6643540	Streaks?
6643540	6644500	Yeah.
6644500	6645460	Like naked people?
6647300	6648100	Nah, dog.
6648100	6649780	It's like these fucking little pens and shit.
6649780	6650740	They're little thick pens
6650740	6652500	like magnum markers and shit.
6652500	6654420	And it's basically paint base.
6654980	6656340	So, you know, in middle school...
6656340	6657700	Paint pens.
6657700	6658980	Yeah, in middle school,
6658980	6659700	early high school,
6659700	6660820	I used to be on the walls
6660820	6661700	hitting up everywhere,
6661700	6662740	my name and shit like that.
6662740	6663460	Oh, that should be a nightmare.
6663460	6665220	Then it got into spray canning
6665220	6666020	and then I hit up
6666020	6666980	the fucking freeway
6666980	6667940	spray painting and shit.
6668740	6669620	It was all bullshit.
6669620	6670580	Can I ask you a little bit?
6670580	6671380	When people tag her,
6671380	6672980	they getting just a little high.
6672980	6673460	Didn't that come out?
6673460	6674180	Yeah, they can.
6674180	6675060	Yeah, yeah.
6675060	6676660	That's kind of part of it.
6676660	6677220	Yeah, you know,
6677220	6677940	because a lot of people
6677940	6681460	ain't gonna go fucking buy fucking masks.
6681460	6681700	Right.
6681700	6682900	To go fucking spray can.
6682900	6683940	You spray paint or whatever.
6683940	6685140	You know, I did it on the strength
6685140	6686420	and we used to hit a big ass
6686420	6687940	fucking walls on the side of the freeway.
6688660	6689060	You know?
6689060	6690820	And I would get fucking laid off that shit.
6690820	6691140	Yeah.
6691140	6692260	I get lightheaded for reals.
6692260	6693380	I had to take breaks.
6693380	6694340	It's kind of dope though.
6694340	6694660	Yeah.
6694660	6696820	Because nobody else makes art
6696820	6698180	in a way that gets them stoned
6698180	6698900	at the same time.
6698900	6699380	Yeah.
6699940	6701060	That's where the creativity
6701060	6702020	comes out my boy.
6702020	6702820	Except for this show.
6705540	6706100	There you go.
6706100	6706820	That's pretty dope.
6707140	6708260	You didn't lose anybody.
6708260	6708580	All right.
6708580	6709620	Well, what have we learned?
6712180	6713060	Let me see.
6713060	6714740	If you see a Cholo tonight,
6716420	6717140	don't get scared
6717140	6718420	because they might be humble.
6718420	6718980	Yeah.
6718980	6720980	Ask them what they want.
6720980	6721860	Yeah, what kind of strain
6721860	6722740	they like to smoke.
6724660	6725780	Yeah, ask them what kind of strain
6725780	6726740	they like to smoke.
6726740	6728100	What kind of bitches they like to fuck.
6728100	6730020	What kind of drink they like to drink.
6730020	6730660	You know what I'm saying?
6730660	6731940	What kind of fucking...
6731940	6733060	How they rolling?
6733060	6733620	Yeah.
6733620	6734500	How they rolling?
6734500	6735060	You know what I'm saying?
6735060	6736180	Do they pop mollies?
6736180	6737860	Do they pop ecstasies?
6737860	6740100	Or do they just fucking look all gangbanged
6740100	6740740	the fuck out
6740740	6742340	and they just work regular day jobs?
6743140	6744020	It's fine with me.
6744020	6744500	You never know.
6744500	6745620	They might be your best friend.
6746260	6748260	Is sad clown really a sad clown
6748260	6750340	or is it more of an introspective person?
6751060	6751780	All I know is that
6751780	6753300	that's the homie Payaso.
6753300	6753780	I don't know.
6754820	6755540	Payaso?
6755540	6756020	Yeah.
6756020	6758260	Sad clown, happy clown, smile now cry later.
6758260	6758580	I don't know.
6758580	6759940	You never know the difference, bro.
6759940	6760420	Oh.
6760420	6760580	Yeah.
6760580	6762260	We're all fucked up anyways.
6762260	6762740	What was that?
6762740	6764500	Well, you're moving too fast for me.
6764500	6765220	What was that?
6765380	6765940	Payaso.
6765940	6767540	I'm so excited to learn the word Payaso.
6767540	6768340	I don't know what that means.
6768340	6769460	Payaso clown?
6769460	6770580	Oh, Payaso means clown.
6770580	6771060	Yeah.
6771060	6771780	Okay, great.
6771780	6772500	Now I'm fucking...
6772500	6774580	See, like I just expanded my world.
6774580	6775940	You got the homie Payaso.
6775940	6777380	You got the homegirl Payaso.
6778100	6779540	Got the homegirl clowner.
6779540	6780420	Got the homo clown.
6780420	6780820	Payas X.
6785860	6786420	Sorry.
6786420	6787220	Sorry, everybody.
6787220	6787860	Sorry.
6787860	6788420	Should we do...
6788420	6788900	I don't know.
6788900	6789140	I'm nothing.
6789140	6790180	Should we do like a real beat?
6790980	6791940	You want to do a real beat?
6791940	6794980	It's either that or Cholo's try D&D real quick.
6795620	6796660	Oh, shit.
6796660	6797460	Let's do Cholo's try D&D.
6797460	6800260	In either case, we got three minutes.
6800260	6801220	Let's do Cholo's try D&D.
6801220	6801940	Hey, hold on, hold on.
6801940	6803220	I'm not too hyped on what the fuck.
6803220	6803860	D&D means what that is.
6803860	6804660	That's even better.
6804660	6805060	What that is.
6805060	6806020	Well, that's good.
6806020	6807780	That's because you got to try it, Cholo.
6809300	6809860	All right.
6809860	6810740	No, no, no.
6810740	6811380	I don't think it's...
6812020	6815300	We don't rush D&D and whore it out like this, do we?
6815300	6816740	It's all whatever.
6816740	6817460	I don't want to...
6817460	6817860	I don't...
6817860	6818260	I want to do...
6818260	6821140	Not since Carmen Quest season three got picked up by Verve.
