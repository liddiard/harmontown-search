30000	32000	Ladies and gentlemen
32000	36000	Superstar, Wonder Master, Game Master
36000	40000	Spencer Gringer
42000	44000	So stop running at the mouth

52000	55000	So stop running at the mouth
55000	58000	So stop running at the mouth
63000	67000	Yo, yo, yo, yo
67000	70000	High-pitched rapper, rapping at a high-pitched
70000	73000	Fuck your mama, cause I'm getting nine stitches
73000	76000	It's easy out of me
76000	79000	I'm out of me, but it's gross, okay stop
80000	83000	I already went to a gross place immediately
83000	86000	A pieziotomy
86000	90000	For the folks at home, what's an a pieziotomy?
90000	92000	I mean, I know what one is
92000	95000	That's a world record for how gross it got
95000	98000	It was like right at the gross line
98000	100000	Like coming off the starting block
100000	101000	It was brave
101000	103000	My first step was gross
103000	105000	Yeah, but you know the deal in order to freestyle
105000	106000	Well, you gotta be brave
106000	108000	A pieziotomy was a brave jumping off point
109000	111000	You know what, I'm torn now
111000	113000	Okay, sometimes I'm like
113000	116000	Well, maybe not so much self-reflection
116000	119000	I watched my first AOC
119000	121000	Instagram Live
121000	124000	Have you seen her do her Instagram streams?
124000	126000	I haven't, I have followed AOC
126000	128000	She apparently just
128000	131000	I watched it and was genuinely inspiring
131000	133000	From an attitudinal standpoint
133000	136000	From a performative standpoint
136000	139000	It really doesn't matter what your politics are
139000	141000	For a politician to be like
141000	143000	I'm gonna make a chicken dinner
143000	146000	And talk shop
146000	148000	And it wasn't like
148000	150000	She wasn't like spending the whole time going like
150000	152000	I'm sorry, was that racist?
152000	154000	I don't know
154000	155000	It's refreshing
155000	156000	She was just sort of like
156000	160000	And you better believe she gets more trolls than I've ever had
160000	163000	Like I was just like watching
163000	165000	Everyone's taken the
165000	167000	Pottest pot shots of her
167000	169000	Sorry if I hit you with a piece of popcorn
170000	172000	See, she wouldn't say that
172000	173000	She'd be like
173000	175000	I gotta get a new bowl for my chicken
175000	176000	She was just like
176000	179000	And that's how
179000	181000	Collective bargaining will work for healthcare
181000	183000	You know what, I need a mixing bowl
183000	187000	And she just had this kind of calm
187000	189000	I was watching it and I'm like
189000	191000	She's not fucking around
191000	193000	She doesn't
193000	195000	She really does need that mixing bowl
195000	197000	She's not
197000	199000	She's smart enough to know that she's not
199000	202000	If there's like 11 handlers off camera going like
202000	203000	No, no, no, don't
203000	205000	Not the mixing bowl
205000	207000	You know, like she'd have a million reasons to like
207000	209000	Tail spin
209000	212000	But she's genuinely making like a family dinner
212000	214000	And just propped her phone up and she's like
214000	215000	Okay, what's the next question?
215000	217000	And then there's a million dudes going like
217000	219000	How much for a blowjob?
219000	222000	And she's just like I need a mixing bowl
222000	223000	It's fucking inspiring
223000	224000	It is, it is
224000	226000	Because you see that she really wants to do it
226000	228000	She's used to seeing politicians who don't want to do it
228000	230000	Yeah, to know that you're
230000	234000	I mean, what have we associated politics with
234000	236000	Throughout history, what is the problem with it?
236000	237000	It's always that
237000	239000	Oh, the kinds of people that aspire to it
239000	241000	Are exactly the kind of people you don't want to give that job to
241000	242000	That's right
242000	243000	Because they're pieces of shit
243000	244000	Right
244000	245000	And maybe she's
245000	246000	Maybe she's a piece of shit
246000	248000	I don't know that much about her
248000	249000	But I'll tell you what
249000	251000	She knows how to fucking Instagram Live
251000	252000	Right
252000	254000	Tell you, she's got that on me
254000	255000	Yeah
255000	256000	I was like, man, I'm inspired
256000	260000	She's like the Joan of Arc of Instagram Live
260000	261000	Yeah
261000	262000	I've been trying
262000	264000	I ask myself while I work out
264000	266000	In my Instagram Live feed
266000	268000	What would AOC do right now
268000	270000	And I just think get a mixing bowl
270000	272000	Like
272000	273000	I just try to get the
273000	274000	Was that a fake laugh?
274000	275000	Oh, yeah
276000	279000	I got to do that these days
279000	281000	Is it really that needed?
281000	284000	No, no, it's a real laugh
284000	286000	How are you, Spencer?
286000	288000	Oh, I'm so good
288000	290000	I'm not great, I'm fine
290000	291000	It's good
291000	293000	All right, mixed signals
293000	295000	Yeah, that's me, baby
295000	296000	You need a mixing bowl?
296000	297000	I was going to go there, yeah
297000	298000	For those signals?
298000	299000	Yeah
299000	301000	How do you think they got as such?
301000	302000	Oh
302000	304000	Why don't you go there on one of them?
305000	306000	I might
306000	307000	All right
307000	308000	On my feelings
308000	309000	Yeah
309000	310000	Or my signals
310000	312000	Just one bad thing, one good thing
312000	313000	Okay
314000	316000	One bad thing
316000	317000	I hate myself
317000	318000	Okay
318000	320000	All right, we're going to have to skip the next question
320000	321000	I lied
321000	323000	No, one good thing
323000	324000	One good thing
326000	327000	I don't know, man
327000	328000	Let's see
329000	331000	I guess it's not so mixed
331000	333000	How's it going with your
334000	335000	It's just kind of a bowl of
335000	336000	It's all on one
336000	338000	Yeah, it's all, it's just one
338000	340000	Sorry again, hearing the splash though
340000	343000	No, that was a vodka to go with the popcorn flake that flew off earlier
344000	347000	What are you writing down? Are you? Oh no
347000	348000	Popcorn
348000	349000	She's sketchy
349000	350000	She's sketchy
350000	351000	Oh, you're just drawing
351000	352000	How dare you
353000	355000	It's the opposite of writing, it's fine
356000	358000	Drawing can only ever be supportive
359000	362000	If you're writing, it's like it could go either way
363000	365000	She made me look like Post Malone
365000	367000	I don't want any of this to get out
367000	368000	I don't want anything to leave this room
368000	369000	Don't write anything down
369000	370000	This is between us
370000	372000	You could hand that to someone on a pony
372000	375000	It could be in Delaware by Wednesday
376000	377000	I know
377000	379000	Man, these hipsters, they real old style
379000	380000	Yeah, they love it
380000	382000	They come to your show, they don't take pictures for Instagram
382000	384000	They draw the shit
384000	385000	Hand it to a red coat
385000	386000	Right
386000	387000	They hand it to a Wright brother
387000	391000	And then there's a dirigible going to the Santa Barbara
391000	394000	The next thing you know, the old jeds a millionaire
399000	400000	That's all folks
403000	406000	I was talking, I was talking, I was realizing recently
406000	410000	I have some deep seated issues with my parents that I've been exploring
410000	412000	My therapist says I should get a haircut
412000	415000	Right, well I wanted to ask you about your therapist
415000	416000	Oh yeah
418000	419000	Well don't let me stop you
420000	422000	For those of you who are new to the podcast
422000	424000	Spencer's therapist is a bully
424000	425000	Oh yeah
425000	427000	Who just wants him to cut his hair
427000	429000	Because it's long
429000	431000	Is that still happening?
431000	436000	No, I didn't see him for a month or longer
436000	439000	Because he had some stuff, I had some stuff, you know
439000	441000	He had a rope, he had to climb
441000	442000	Right
442000	444000	He went to a therapist convention
445000	447000	You don't want that to happen
447000	450000	Yeah, I want a therapist to get convincing
450000	451000	Yeah
451000	454000	I always felt like when I was going to a chiropractor
454000	456000	And he would go like
456000	458000	Oh I can't do next week at the regular time
458000	459000	I'm going to a convention and be like
459000	461000	Great, great
461000	464000	You're going to go to nine seminars about how to
464000	469000	Fucking tell me that my foot lymphness has to do with whether I should eat Cheetos
470000	471000	Fucking garbage
471000	474000	You're going to start making me fill out new Xerox forms
474000	477000	You got for free from some fucking dude in Hall H
477000	480000	I'm going to be poking you with his other hand or something
480000	483000	But did your therapist come back with a different attitude?
483000	485000	Yeah, he was like, your hair is great
485000	486000	Oh, see
486000	487000	No, no, it's fine
487000	488000	God damn it
488000	489000	You got to be excited
489000	491000	Because that's what I was thinking is that he would go to a convention
491000	493000	Maybe it's his first one in four years or something
493000	495000	And then he'd go to a seminar and be like
495000	499000	Hey, stop telling your customers to cut their hair
499000	501000	That's like not cool
501000	502000	Well, I don't know
502000	505000	My friend has a therapist who she says
505000	508000	Subscribes to that simulation theory of the world
508000	511000	Which I don't know that there's a lot of religious beliefs
511000	513000	I don't want a therapist to have
513000	516000	But it's all a simulation is probably like
516000	518000	It's got to be one of the worst
518000	520000	It just seems really fucked up to me
520000	521000	Yeah
521000	522000	Like oh, you know what you got to do
522000	524000	A cheat code
525000	526000	What?
526000	528000	Just get into hacking
529000	532000	But no, no, one of my therapists said
534000	535000	I don't know
537000	540000	He asked me about my social life a lot
540000	543000	Which I think is because the first time I came in
543000	545000	I was like really depressed about a girl
545000	548000	And I was just bummed out and it was bummed me out
548000	551000	And that's one of the reasons why I started seeing a therapist
551000	554000	And so since then he's been asking me about my social life
554000	556000	But I always take that as like
556000	558000	Transition into talking about my hair
558000	560000	So I've been trying to be like
560000	561000	Oh, that's great
561000	562000	Oh, went to the beach
562000	563000	Oh boy
564000	566000	Which I don't think is a good use of therapy
566000	567000	You know
567000	568000	By the way, there's no guests tonight
568000	569000	So fuck off
570000	572000	In a way, we're all the guests
572000	574000	Let's bring out Spencer's therapist
574000	575000	Ooh
575000	576000	God, that would be amazing
576000	577000	God damn bully
577000	578000	We should book him
578000	579000	That would be cool
579000	580000	Well, I don't know
580000	581000	It would be hostile
581000	583000	But it would be interesting to just ask him questions
583000	584000	Like it was a real person
585000	587000	When he asks you about your social life
587000	588000	What is he saying?
588000	590000	Is he asking where you go?
590000	592000	Is he trying to fucking hang?
592000	593000	What is he?
593000	594000	He's trying to hang
594000	595000	No, I think that
595000	598000	I think he's just wanting to know what I'm doing
598000	599000	Because I think that
599000	601000	Do you even have any friends?
601000	606000	It's a picture your therapist is like a bad guy from an 80s ski movie
606000	608000	Do you even have any friends?
608000	609000	Why don't you get a haircut?
609000	610000	Yeah, man
610000	613000	Maybe you'd have more fun if you cut your fucking hair, bro
613000	614000	Who do you know here?
614000	616000	Who do you know at this therapist's office?
616000	621000	My therapist started asking me to shower more as I shared
621000	625000	But then also, which I have started doing because I have a pool now
625000	626000	So now I just shower more
626000	629000	And I have a better shower of one of those showers
629000	630000	Where you just like
630000	634000	There's less difference between the shower and the bathroom
634000	638000	So it just feels more like, you know, like a fancy hotel
638000	639000	You can walk right in
639000	640000	Yeah, you walk in and you go
641000	642000	And it goes psss
642000	643000	And you go psss
644000	645000	You start peeing
645000	646000	Yeah, instead of like
647000	649000	You step over it
649000	650000	Something about that
650000	651000	You get in that tub
651000	652000	That poor people tub
652000	653000	And it's like
653000	655000	In the fucking shower heads
655000	656000	Just like
657000	658000	And you're like
663000	664000	And instead of it
664000	665000	It's just like a big booth
665000	668000	And I can just stand behind the shower head
668000	669000	And be like psss
669000	670000	And be as cold as you want
670000	672000	You fucking shit fuck
672000	673000	Okay
673000	674000	And I'll talk to you when you're hot
674000	675000	And then I'm like
675000	676000	You're too hot
676000	677000	I'll talk to you when you're fucking
677000	679000	The temperature of my mom's womb
682000	683000	Too soon
683000	684000	Too late
684000	685000	Too soon
686000	687000	And then I'm just
687000	688000	So then I'm like
688000	690000	Okay, I'll shower all the time
690000	691000	Big deal
691000	693000	Like I always knew it was bullshit
693000	696000	So now I'm the cleanest nerd in the world
696000	698000	I guess I'm your worst nightmare
699000	700000	Can I be
700000	702000	Can I be the president now?
702000	704000	I'm so clean
704000	705000	Smell my dick
708000	710000	Eat off my armpit
710000	712000	You can make a rap sandwich
712000	713000	In my armpit
713000	714000	I'm so cool
714000	716000	I'm so cool
719000	722000	You took it too far when you said rap
725000	727000	Another thing my therapist started saying though
727000	728000	And this troubles me
728000	731000	As my therapist started saying at the end of the sessions
731000	732000	She now goes
732000	734000	So what do you want to do
736000	738000	Next week? Two weeks?
739000	740000	A suspect
740000	741000	Like she's kind of like
741000	742000	I think you're done
743000	746000	Like why are you coming every week?
746000	747000	You're boring
748000	749000	Like we get it
749000	750000	You're rich
750000	751000	You're happy
752000	753000	Oh good
754000	756000	Like what do you just come here to fucking
756000	759000	Talk about some dude that got on your nerves on the freeway
759000	761000	That's not why I get paid
761000	763000	Fuck off you fat jerk
763000	764000	Okay
764000	765000	But again
767000	769000	I think that's awesome to graduate
769000	770000	I know but it feels
770000	771000	But then you also
771000	772000	I feel terrified
772000	773000	I feel I'm like no mama
773000	775000	I need to come back every week
775000	776000	I'm moving
776000	777000	I got all kinds of problems
777000	779000	What if something doesn't spark joy?
781000	782000	And that's true
782000	783000	My shit's like
783000	785000	I still have shit that baby I haven't told you yet
785000	786000	Yeah
786000	787000	Yeah exactly
787000	789000	I want to like beef it up
790000	791000	Like
792000	794000	At the end of a season of
794000	795000	Law and Order
795000	796000	Just like throw in
796000	797000	By the way I'm an alcoholic
800000	802000	Jerry Orbeck's got a problem
802000	803000	His daughter killed himself
803000	805000	I just want to turn to her and be like
806000	808000	Okay so now here's the real me
808000	809000	Yeah
809000	810000	After like four years of seeing
810000	812000	That would be amazing at the end of it
812000	813000	Thank you so much
813000	814000	Yeah I think I'll do two weeks from now
814000	817000	By the way I've always been British
818000	820000	You're a terrible therapist
822000	824000	You did not pick up my accent
824000	827000	You never knew I wasn't British
830000	832000	How would a therapist react to that?
832000	833000	Should they be like
833000	836000	Oh you get some money back?
836000	838000	You're right I'm not that good
838000	840000	I've been treating you as an American
840000	843000	Which means that I don't know who you are
843000	846000	So that would be like finding out
846000	848000	Your doctor's stethoscope didn't work
849000	852000	I've been British the whole time
852000	853000	Love
854000	855000	Governor
855000	858000	I'm not qualified to check your prostate
860000	861000	The entire time
862000	864000	Alright Uber
865000	867000	Updated its app
868000	872000	And the reckoning is upon us
872000	874000	There's now when you order a ride
874000	876000	A thing comes up and it says
878000	879000	Something I've always dreamt of
879000	881000	It says like okay and
881000	883000	What's your conversation preference?
883000	886000	You can say I want a quiet
886000	888000	Or I want a chatty
888000	889000	What?
889000	891000	Yeah it's like the two settings are like
891000	893000	Keep it quiet or
893000	896000	I don't mind a chat
896000	897000	Something like that
897000	898000	Which one are you?
898000	900000	Well 90% of the time
900000	901000	Quiet
901000	903000	But then and I always wanted that
903000	904000	I've always said
904000	905000	I think a lot of people have always said
905000	907000	By the way could you add a fucking button
907000	908000	You've said that
908000	909000	I was going to say yeah
909000	911000	Like add a button that says
911000	913000	Just to let you know
913000	915000	Before you even accept the fare
915000	917000	I don't want to make a friend tonight
917000	919000	I don't want to hear about your podcast
919000	920000	I don't want to fucking like
920000	922000	I don't want you to question my fucking
922000	923000	Left turns and right turns
923000	924000	I don't want you to
924000	926000	I could imagine for the ladies
926000	927000	Maybe there's a whole thing there
927000	929000	It's like don't fucking talk to me
929000	930000	Right
931000	933000	And finally now there's a button there
933000	935000	But now I'm filled with anxiety
935000	936000	Because I'm always like
936000	938000	I hit that button and then I'm like
938000	939000	I keep thinking
939000	941000	Well one of these days I'm going to hit a
941000	945000	Oh maybe I'll have like just taken an Adderall
945000	946000	An hour earlier
946000	947000	Oh shit
947000	948000	And I'm like
948000	949000	I'm just kind of in a high mood
949000	950000	And I'm like
950000	951000	You know what?
951000	954000	I don't mind having a little chitty chat
954000	957000	And like the tyranny of that now
957000	959000	For a driver who would normally
959000	961000	The Jason Statham transporter out there
961000	962000	Who's like
962000	963000	I have two rules, love
963000	964000	I don't, I don't
964000	965000	Oh you don't bug me
965000	967000	I don't bug you
967000	969000	Oh just pick up you
969000	970000	Take you from home plate
970000	971000	And then they get the fare
971000	972000	And they're like
972000	973000	It's like
973000	974000	Wouldn't mind a little chat
974000	975000	And I'm like
975000	976000	Ugh
976000	978000	Like you don't want to punish somebody
978000	981000	Like force somebody to like be driving
981000	982000	Like
982000	983000	How's the weather?
983000	985000	God damn it
985000	986000	Fuck this
986000	987000	Yeah
987000	988000	I should be stuck with
988000	990000	The Sinbad of Uber drivers
990000	991000	She's like
991000	993000	All my La Cienega jokes
993000	995000	All my San Vicente jokes
995000	996000	Hey man
996000	997000	Here we go by Pinks
997000	1001000	You know Pinks is a hot dog seller
1001000	1003000	I don't want to be in the car with that dude
1003000	1004000	Yeah
1004000	1006000	They could have just been like
1006000	1007000	Normal
1007000	1009000	Or just give me a fucking minute
1009000	1010000	You know
1010000	1011000	Instead of like
1011000	1013000	You gotta be talking man
1013000	1015000	Talk
1016000	1018000	You better yes and me dog
1019000	1020000	Cause it's not
1020000	1023000	I don't know who's requesting chattiness
1023000	1024000	It just seems like
1024000	1025000	You know it's like
1025000	1026000	I
1026000	1027000	Today my mom died
1027000	1028000	I don't want to talk to anybody
1028000	1029000	That didn't happen to me
1029000	1030000	But it's like
1030000	1031000	That's the circumstance
1031000	1032000	No one's like
1032000	1033000	Hmm
1033000	1034000	How am I feeling?
1034000	1035000	Like cordial?
1035000	1037000	Well the weird thing is the air one
1037000	1038000	Cause it's like
1038000	1039000	Chat preferences
1039000	1040000	And there's probably like
1040000	1041000	Music preferences
1041000	1042000	And there's one that's like
1042000	1043000	Air preferences
1043000	1044000	And the choices are
1044000	1045000	Hot
1045000	1048000	Who's choosing hot?
1048000	1051000	Warm
1051000	1053000	Cool
1053000	1055000	Cold
1055000	1057000	And no preference
1057000	1058000	But like it kinda
1058000	1061000	That's weird because it makes you
1061000	1064000	It forces someone who ordinarily
1064000	1066000	Your default choice would be like
1066000	1067000	Well wait a minute
1067000	1069000	I want you to be accountable
1069000	1070000	To the livability
1070000	1072000	Of the temperature of your
1072000	1073000	Right
1073000	1075000	Of your cabin
1075000	1076000	But that
1076000	1078000	The only choice for a person
1078000	1079000	That feels that way
1079000	1080000	Is no preference
1080000	1081000	Which is it
1081000	1082000	It's a weird thing to say
1082000	1083000	About your
1083000	1084000	The temperature of a car
1084000	1085000	You're getting to
1085000	1086000	No preference
1086000	1088000	Well I do have a preference
1088000	1090000	I hope it's not cold
1090000	1091000	Right
1091000	1093000	I also hope it's not hot
1093000	1094000	There is no selection
1094000	1096000	In other words that just says
1096000	1097000	Uh
1097000	1098000	Room temperature
1098000	1099000	Right
1099000	1100000	It's no preference
1100000	1101000	Which to me
1101000	1102000	Is like
1102000	1103000	I decided
1103000	1104000	I'm the Ken Bone of temperature
1104000	1105000	I don't know
1105000	1106000	I don't wanna
1106000	1107000	I don't
1107000	1109000	I still haven't made up my mind
1109000	1111000	Give me what you got
1111000	1113000	I'm adorable
1113000	1114000	I'm just here to
1114000	1115000	Feel things out
1115000	1117000	Like how will I know
1117000	1119000	If I'm not exposed to all the elements
1119000	1121000	And then they might feel like
1121000	1122000	I need to
1122000	1123000	Like blast you with
1123000	1125000	Boy what a shitty episode this is
1125000	1128000	I mean that's really
1128000	1130000	I think that's all I got
1130000	1131000	Honestly
1131000	1132000	I don't know what we're gonna do
1132000	1133000	It's fucked up that somebody
1133000	1135000	Could get in your car and be like
1135000	1138000	I'm hot and I told you to shut up
1138000	1140000	This is my checklist
1140000	1141000	It says
1141000	1142000	Quiet preferred button Uber
1142000	1144000	An AOC chicken dinner
1144000	1145000	That's my
1145000	1146000	That's my
1146000	1147000	Those are my notes
1147000	1148000	I didn't
1148000	1152000	Guys I thought that was two hours of
1152000	1153000	Oh well
1153000	1155000	Well we're freestyling now
1155000	1156000	Alright no net
1156000	1157000	Good
1157000	1158000	We don't need no fucking
1158000	1159000	No
1159000	1160000	How are you
1160000	1161000	How's your clothes
1165000	1167000	God dammit they're lovely
1170000	1172000	What'd you do this weekend?
1175000	1178000	I forced myself to go to my old house
1178000	1181000	And grab some stuff that I felt like
1181000	1184000	Was worth bringing over to my new house
1184000	1187000	I'm like living in a big empty house
1187000	1189000	Cody and I are like
1190000	1192000	Living in this unfurnished house
1192000	1194000	Sleeping on a mattress on the floor
1194000	1195000	And it's kinda
1196000	1198000	Like we keep joking like
1198000	1199000	Oh maybe we
1199000	1200000	Maybe this is a new lifestyle
1200000	1202000	Like no furniture
1202000	1205000	There is a decorator that will eventually
1205000	1206000	Be furnishing the place
1206000	1208000	But in the meantime we're kind of like
1208000	1209000	What are we supposed to
1209000	1212000	It's usually when you move
1212000	1214000	You gotta couch at your old place
1214000	1216000	You're gonna bring it to your new place
1216000	1218000	Because number one usually
1218000	1221000	Your old place is not gonna stay your place
1221000	1224000	And you also don't want to buy a new couch
1224000	1227000	So I don't think I have to explain this to you guys
1228000	1230000	But I have to explain it to you because
1230000	1233000	You have to understand it's not the case with me
1233000	1235000	Like I'm keeping my old house
1235000	1239000	And I don't want any of the furniture in it
1239000	1241000	At my new place because number one
1241000	1244000	I'm probably gonna rent my old house
1244000	1245000	Right
1245000	1246000	So I'm not gonna
1246000	1248000	I may not rent it unfurnished
1248000	1251000	Because you don't rent a house with no furniture
1251000	1253000	I don't think
1253000	1254000	You can do both
1254000	1255000	It could do both
1255000	1257000	I lived in a rented house once that was unfurnished
1257000	1258000	Because it was like
1258000	1260000	Oh I'm gonna rent this place yearly
1260000	1261000	So there is that
1261000	1263000	But then there's also the more like
1263000	1265000	Kind of like upscale like
1265000	1266000	Hey this is
1266000	1268000	This place is ready to go
1268000	1271000	Leo DiCaprio's nephew who's in town for a year
1271000	1273000	And who has money to burn and
1273000	1274000	Just like
1274000	1276000	I don't know if there's like a market for that
1276000	1278000	And that market may depend on
1278000	1280000	Oh just keep the furniture that's there
1280000	1282000	At any rate I'm not gonna throw the furniture
1282000	1283000	And the garbage
1283000	1284000	Right
1284000	1285000	But I'm not gonna move it to the new place
1285000	1286000	And I'm not gonna
1286000	1287000	And it's just like
1287000	1288000	It's just like
1288000	1290000	The house is just filled with shit
1290000	1292000	And we were talking about this last night
1292000	1296000	Like it's like you start to realize
1296000	1298000	Usually it's forced upon you because
1298000	1299000	You're
1299000	1300000	You're move
1300000	1302000	You gotta get out of your old place
1302000	1304000	You gotta go through that shit anyway
1304000	1306000	But if you don't have to go through it
1306000	1307000	If it's sitting there
1307000	1308000	You're kind of like
1308000	1312000	Oh you just start to realize your whole life
1312000	1315000	Represents decisions that you delayed
1315000	1317000	That's what your house is full of
1317000	1320000	Is shit that you put off thinking about
1320000	1322000	That's what's on every shelf
1322000	1325000	It's like piles of paper that
1325000	1327000	Like may or may not be valuable
1327000	1330000	They weren't so obviously garbage
1330000	1333000	That it was joyful to throw them away
1333000	1336000	But they also definitely aren't like
1336000	1340000	Oh old man Withers special paper that he gave me to
1340000	1342000	Oh I'm so close to my heart
1342000	1343000	And it's like
1343000	1346000	You're now like forced to
1346000	1348000	I gotta either throw this shit out
1348000	1350000	Or I gotta bring it
1350000	1352000	I gotta act like I'm proud of it
1352000	1354000	And bring it over to my new place
1354000	1355000	I don't wanna do either
1355000	1356000	And it kind of
1356000	1359000	It makes me like wake up in an unfurnished house
1359000	1361000	Every morning and go
1361000	1363000	What should I do today
1363000	1364000	Let's say on the weekend
1364000	1365000	It's like
1365000	1367000	There could be a million answers to that if you're just
1367000	1369000	In the bustle of moving
1369000	1370000	But you're like
1370000	1372000	You wake up and you go
1372000	1374000	Shit I don't have anything here
1374000	1375000	And you go
1375000	1376000	Well I got a bunch of shit at the old house
1376000	1378000	Should I go grab that computer?
1378000	1380000	Nah that computer sucks
1380000	1382000	Like you're probably gonna get a new computer
1382000	1384000	You know what that old ass computer
1384000	1385000	Over here
1385000	1386000	And then you go
1386000	1388000	Am I really gonna spend
1388000	1390000	30,000 dollars
1390000	1392000	On a new fucking Mac Pro
1392000	1394000	Or am I gonna go PC
1394000	1395000	Or am I gonna go
1395000	1397000	Like because
1397000	1398000	And then I'm like
1398000	1399000	I don't wanna think about that
1399000	1400000	I don't wanna think about that
1400000	1401000	Right
1401000	1402000	And then I'm like
1402000	1404000	Okay fuck computers
1404000	1405000	And then you're like
1405000	1406000	What's left?
1406000	1407000	Shirts?
1407000	1410000	Should I bring 11,000
1410000	1412000	Rick and Morty shirts over here?
1412000	1414000	That I don't wear
1414000	1417000	Cause I don't want people to see me in public
1417000	1418000	And think
1418000	1419000	That's so sad
1419000	1422000	He wants us to ask about the show
1422000	1423000	So I don't
1423000	1426000	But I'm not throwing those away
1426000	1428000	What am I doing with those shirts?
1428000	1430000	I have 11,000 Rick and Morty shirts
1430000	1431000	What am I...
1431000	1432000	I can't throw them away
1432000	1434000	I don't wanna be responsible for a bunch of homeless people
1434000	1435000	Going down
1435000	1436000	It's like
1436000	1438000	I don't wanna be the new Britney Spears
1438000	1440000	Where it's like all the homeless people
1440000	1443000	Are wearing Rick and Morty shirts
1443000	1446000	The creator gave me this man
1446000	1450000	This was dumped off in a U-Haul at the Goodwill
1450000	1452000	And like everyone's just like
1452000	1454000	Pickle Rick
1454000	1458000	I could actually undercut my own cottage industry
1458000	1460000	By doing that here
1460000	1461000	Also the irony
1461000	1464000	If you should ever become homeless
1464000	1466000	And then I end up
1466000	1468000	And then you're down there wearing a Rick and Morty shirt
1468000	1469000	And you're like
1469000	1472000	Hey same guy gave it to you gave it to me
1474000	1476000	Maybe you can have an estate sale
1476000	1478000	And have people come over
1478000	1479000	Buy the shit
1479000	1480000	Lug it away
1480000	1483000	And wander the premises in your boxer shorts
1483000	1486000	Crying about how this was your dad's house
1488000	1491000	I think you're on to something there, Brandon
1491000	1494000	Is that all under the category of...
1494000	1496000	That's what an estate sale is
1496000	1502000	So I could pretend I died
1502000	1504000	And that I'm my own uncle
1504000	1506000	Or something like that
1506000	1509000	You can be whoever you want
1509000	1511000	You could be like
1513000	1515000	And I killed him
1517000	1519000	Like a Marvin Gaye's dad
1522000	1523000	I'm out on bail
1523000	1524000	I shot my son
1524000	1526000	Would you like his bedspread?
1528000	1530000	I gotta make bail
1531000	1533000	Why are prices so low?
1533000	1534000	Prices are so low
1534000	1536000	Cause I gotta make bail
1536000	1539000	By the way if you're listening and you're part of the Marvin Gaye family
1539000	1541000	I'm sorry, so sorry
1541000	1542000	That's what the news
1542000	1544000	You can't joke about anything
1544000	1546000	Everyone's becoming keen now
1546000	1548000	They're counting that blurred lines money
1548000	1557000	For the folks at home, what's the Marvin Gaye family doing?
1557000	1559000	Well I don't know what the Marvin Gaye family's doing
1559000	1561000	What have they done?
1561000	1563000	Marvin Gaye was a singer
1563000	1564000	Classic
1564000	1565000	Was he in the Commodores?
1565000	1567000	No, no, he was his own thing
1567000	1569000	He was Marvin Gaye and Tammy Tarot
1569000	1571000	It was a Motons staple
1571000	1573000	Until he shot his son
1573000	1574000	And his dad shot him
1574000	1576000	Oh, he was jealous, jealous dad?
1576000	1578000	His dad shot him because he stood up to his father
1578000	1580000	His father had been abusive to his mom
1580000	1581000	Sure
1581000	1583000	For years, then the Marvin fell on some hard times
1583000	1585000	Had to move back in with the parents
1585000	1588000	Was like, you can't keep talking to mom like that
1588000	1591000	Especially now that I've been famous
1591000	1592000	That's fucking heartbreak
1592000	1594000	Yeah, then was like laying down asleep
1594000	1596000	And his dad came in and was like
1598000	1599000	And then shot him
1599000	1602000	Man, see family's the worst, right?
1602000	1605000	Probably not a controversial opinion
1605000	1607000	But what a shitty dad
1607000	1608000	Yeah
1608000	1611000	Well, you know, I don't want to go
1611000	1613000	I don't want to, you know, play the devil's advocate here
1613000	1616000	But I'm on his side
1616000	1619000	But sometimes kids can be a drag, is that what you're going to say?
1619000	1622000	Sometimes you want to be mean to your wife
1622000	1624000	You can't have people telling you not to do that
1624000	1626000	Yeah, I mean, yeah
1626000	1628000	What are you supposed to do, listen to them?
1628000	1632000	You're a product of the twisted relationship between me and your mother
1632000	1634000	How dare you condemn it
1634000	1635000	Right
1635000	1639000	That's almost like saying I'm doing something wrong
1639000	1644000	I just want to say shout out to all those dudes who punched their dads in the face for some shit like that
1644000	1645000	Hell yeah
1645000	1647000	Hope you don't get shot
1647000	1648000	Right
1648000	1650000	I wonder what the statistics are
1650000	1661000	Is there a word for, is there a side, you know, C-I-D-E prefix for, you know, we have patricide, matricide, we have infanticide
1662000	1668000	Is there a side prefix for killing your offspring?
1668000	1672000	Yeah, okay
1672000	1675000	If you say insecticide, I'm going to come out there
1675000	1677000	You're like an evil villain with a bow tie
1677000	1681000	I'm the word miser
1681000	1683000	Are you looking for something?
1683000	1685000	I've got it
1685000	1687000	I will not explain
1687000	1691000	I'll nearly acknowledge its existence
1691000	1694000	You have 20 questions
1694000	1698000	Do you know the word?
1698000	1699000	No
1699000	1703000	You're just voting confidence in the English language
1703000	1708000	You're like, look, I know old lady English has got it
1708000	1712000	It's the same prefix that you use when you give a job to your son
1712000	1715000	He's a riddler
1715000	1723000	It's a different guy, but our audience is just, I mean, you've got to make your own fun in this episode, I agree
1723000	1726000	Like, don't rush anything, I am on your side
1726000	1728000	It's the same prefix when you give
1728000	1729000	Nepicide
1729000	1731000	Nepicide
1731000	1732000	I love this
1732000	1735000	Which is also
1735000	1738000	Which is the Wikipedia says filicide
1738000	1740000	What's that?
1740000	1744000	F-I-L-I side, filicide
1744000	1745000	No
1745000	1747000	How is motherfucker?
1747000	1749000	Nepicide
1749000	1751000	We know what that really means
1751000	1753000	It's the next episode
1753000	1755000	Nepicide
1755000	1758000	It's also possible it could be both, right?
1758000	1760000	Yeah, yeah, there's plenty of words
1760000	1764000	But he had arrogance that made it sound like it could only be one
1764000	1768000	And that was a mistake-icide
1768000	1771000	So hack
1771000	1775000	Why is it, speaking of language, evolving
1775000	1780000	Why do you think it is that I will never use an emoji
1780000	1784000	But I will constantly use animated gifs
1784000	1787000	Like, what is that about me?
1787000	1790000	Do you use emoticons or have you?
1790000	1792000	No, I won't use emoticons
1792000	1797000	When I was growing up, emoticons were the beginning of
1797000	1803000	It was like people using colon and a parenthesis to indicate a smile or frown
1803000	1809000	We were like, the purists among us were like
1809000	1811000	That was like, how dare you?
1811000	1816000	Like, if you can't communicate your state or your position
1816000	1823000	Or whether I should take you seriously without, like, reverting to the ape-like behavior
1823000	1826000	That chased us here to this haven
1826000	1829000	Like, why are you bringing that here?
1829000	1832000	It was like people would do ASCII roses in chat rooms
1832000	1834000	You know, here's a rose
1834000	1837000	Classic
1837000	1841000	I mean, the heroes among us hated those people
1841000	1842000	Heroes
1842000	1844000	And then the emoji came along and was like
1844000	1849000	Oh yeah, why do emoticons when you can do an emoji
1849000	1852000	And I won't touch it, I won't do it
1852000	1856000	I also won't type lol, I'll only type haha
1856000	1861000	I don't understand what my definition of those boundaries are
1861000	1863000	And I especially don't understand why
1863000	1867000	I think animated gifs are the fucking greatest things in sliced bread
1867000	1871000	I think that's amazing that I don't care how hack it is
1871000	1878000	Whether it's ironic or sincere, like, I'll just throw you an image of Jim Carrey going
1878000	1881000	I likey, likey, like whatever
1881000	1885000	I don't suffer a moment of indecision about it
1885000	1887000	I don't think I'm selling out
1887000	1893000	It's like 50 cent, like, fucking smiling and then driving away and then birds in the backseat
1893000	1895000	I love it all
1895000	1896000	Yeah, they're genius
1896000	1898000	Because they're little mini-movies that you can throw at somebody
1898000	1906000	So why is that, why does that meet my definition of classy or like hip or what is
1906000	1910000	It's a chance at sarcasm like never before
1910000	1918000	I don't know, is it because if you send an emoji what you're doing is
1918000	1925000	Is it about inductive versus deductive, like the shape of the telescope, like you're looking through which end
1925000	1930000	If I send Oprah, if you say something to me and I send you an image of Oprah going
1931000	1934000	It's more up to you what that means
1934000	1942000	And that therefore I'm like, I'm not, I'm kind of like being more creative by choosing that Oprah picture
1942000	1946000	Well, I think that memes are, I mean, gifs are basically just memes
1946000	1950000	So it's essentially like responding with like a canned joke, like that's what she said
1950000	1953000	You know, it's like you're being clever using cultural context
1953000	1956000	You're kind of hacking more than you are participating
1956000	1961000	Right, whereas emojis are just simply like, you're just crudely depicting certain concepts
1961000	1964000	Using images instead of words when you could easily use words
1964000	1973000	So it's essentially language, whereas a gif is more of like, it's more of like a joke or something
1973000	1978000	But I think easily that's just a matter of, I mean, I appreciate you saying that
1978000	1982000	But you probably know that that's totally a subjective thing than that
1982000	1986000	Any number of these kids would be like, that's exactly what I do when I send an eggplant emoji
1986000	1988000	Or even a smiling emoji
1988000	1993000	But they're using those characters, like they're creating a language using these new symbols
1993000	1995000	They're essentially new letters
1995000	1997000	But, you know, that's like creating their own meaning
1997000	2001000	And so you could like do the jackoff thing and that's maybe a step removed
2001000	2005000	But that's different than like the sweating in the hand, which are just letters, you know
2005000	2009000	Whereas I think you're communicating the full idea when you share a meme or a gif
2009000	2012000	It's like, again, more like a joke
2012000	2015000	And it is almost like, it's almost like albums to DJs
2015000	2019000	So like certain people have incredible collections of gifs
2019000	2021000	And memes
2021000	2026000	So if you're like, if you're petty, like myself
2026000	2030000	And you're online and you're flaming and you're going back and forth with somebody
2030000	2035000	If they have like just a fucking Pokemon ball size or collection, I don't play Pokemon
2035000	2037000	Because I met girls
2037000	2039000	Oh shit
2041000	2043000	Shot spider
2043000	2046000	That shit was half laughed and half balled up fists
2046000	2048000	And I respect you all for that
2050000	2054000	But some people have like an arsenal of just like images to throw at you
2054000	2057000	And also, okay, so maybe this is what's key about it
2057000	2062000	Is that with the emoji library that you're choosing from
2062000	2067000	You're not choosing from a circulated cabin of air
2067000	2074000	There's a cultural tint to an animated gif library
2074000	2076000	Even if, because I'm not gonna lie
2076000	2083000	I don't curate a fucking folder of awesome gifs and make them and stuff
2083000	2086000	But people do, and because people do
2086000	2091000	It's kind of a little closer to sending a piece of wall graffiti
2091000	2099000	Because there's a culture out there of people who are continuously updating and circulating images
2099000	2102000	Pulling them from TV shows and things
2102000	2109000	And if you're drawing from that pile, you're at least drawing from something more vibrant
2109000	2117000	Than the idea of Pepsi saying to you, here's the 109 images to choose from this fiscal quarter
2117000	2121000	Here's how you say I'm going swimming, it's a drawing of a guy going swimming
2121000	2126000	But over here it's like, here's the latest in
2126000	2132000	But where it fails is where people can use gifs to be just as banal
2132000	2136000	And horrendously enforcing of horrible toxic culture
2136000	2142000	I remember when Megan Gans was reaching out to me on Twitter and going
2142000	2147000	You hurt me or whatever, and the people that were like, all the popcorn gifs
2147000	2150000	Of people eating popcorn, and then other people going like, you're gross
2150000	2152000	This is a gross time for that
2152000	2155000	What the fuck, what? I'm eating popcorn
2155000	2160000	But it was like, that is the same sickening thing that emojis do
2160000	2165000	It reduces us to keys on a keyboard
2165000	2169000	But the healthy idea of it is
2169000	2173000	What did you just say, and then you're pulling
2173000	2176000	You can type words into the little Giphy engine
2176000	2181000	But it's still like, okay, here's Steve Carell getting a pie in his face or something
2181000	2186000	What's cool about the gifs and memes is that you have to pick it yourself
2186000	2188000	Which means you have to know it exists
2188000	2191000	These days you can search for keywords or whatever and get one
2191000	2195000	But it's an artistic decision to pick one that you think fits best
2195000	2201000	And that's also very much like memeing where it's like, there's a bunch of different things that are kind of this basic joke
2201000	2204000	But you picked this one because it's the most applicable
2204000	2208000	Because I'll type like, I went there into Giphy
2208000	2212000	And then it'll come up, and that's how I discovered that 50 cent
2212000	2216000	He's not saying I went there as he's driving away
2216000	2220000	But it's like, that's what comes up when you type I went there or whatever
2220000	2223000	And then Cody and I discovered that
2223000	2225000	And then we have a relationship with that gif
2225000	2229000	We keep on sending 50 cent to each other like driving it
2229000	2233000	It's like an old meme and you can look up the origin of it
2233000	2239000	And then people add like Burt in the backseat as he's driving away and stuff
2239000	2241000	Yeah, but I don't think emoji has that
2241000	2244000	I think you can kind of get there, but it's just at the end of the day
2244000	2248000	It's just like, this means man, this means hand, this means dollar bills
2248000	2251000	And this means I'm talking to you like this
2251000	2253000	It's all the most obnoxious shit
2253000	2254000	Who has ever done that?
2254000	2256000	The worst is the fucking crying thing
2256000	2257000	It's like, I just
2257000	2259000	Oh yeah, the crying laughing
2259000	2261000	It just makes me so fucking mad
2261000	2265000	It's like taking the LOL phenomenon
2265000	2271000	Which is like, people just type LOL or R-O-F-L-R-L-M-A-O
2271000	2275000	It's just such a nervous twitch that everyone wants everyone to know
2275000	2278000	They're laughing at them condescendingly
2278000	2280000	It's so fucking toxic, I fucking hate it
2281000	2285000	If you're going to condescend to someone, you should know how to condescend
2285000	2288000	Not tell them you're condescending
2288000	2292000	It's fucking horseshit that you can raise a flag while you're talking going
2292000	2294000	By the way, I'm condescending to you
2294000	2297000	No, you're not allowed to, you don't have the words
2297000	2303000	Yeah, it does kind of feel like LOL would be executed like LOL
2303000	2307000	It's like holding up a photo of Frasier while you're talking
2307000	2309000	By the way, I'm super smart
2309000	2310000	And from Seattle
2310000	2312000	No, you're not, put that down
2313000	2314000	That would be cool
2315000	2317000	You're not allowed to do that
2317000	2319000	That's one of the biggest
2319000	2323000	It's like fucking, I guess that's me really shaking my cane
2323000	2326000	It was like, in my day, you could really
2326000	2330000	You had to be a genuinely condescending person
2330000	2333000	It would have to be in your fucking veins
2333000	2335000	You couldn't just go get your mail and be like
2335000	2338000	Oh, I wish I was one of those condescending types
2338000	2342000	And then just be like, oh, these letters are then condescending
2342000	2345000	And like, you're not, no, you're not, you're a sincere hillbilly
2345000	2347000	You're not condescending at all
2347000	2348000	You're an idiot
2348000	2350000	You can't condescend to anything
2350000	2352000	But maybe like a termite that's eating your garage
2352000	2354000	You could be like, I'm going to get you
2354000	2357000	L-M-L-M-A-O
2357000	2360000	It's because there's a printing price now
2360000	2362000	Yeah, I mean, these are the frustrations
2362000	2363000	That's the thing that's making me real
2363000	2366000	I'm like, I'm only expressing the frustrations
2366000	2370000	That the fucking status quo expressed to Gutenberg
2370000	2373000	When he printed Police Academy
2373000	2376000	Whoa
2376000	2380000	Yeah, when Martin Luther was like
2380000	2386000	I have a dream that Bibles should be in German instead of Latin
2386000	2391000	Um
2391000	2399000	I don't think these, I don't know if these hilarious historical mix-em-ups are
2399000	2402000	I don't know if they're, they're not landing because you don't get them
2402000	2405000	You're just sort of like, why are you doing that?
2405000	2408000	What are these, is this like fractured flickers?
2408000	2411000	Like, are you doing like a 1950s comedian?
2411000	2414000	Are you going to do, like, Spoonerism next, Spoonerism's next
2414000	2417000	Uh, Fender-Cella
2417000	2419000	Okay, well, what are we looking at?
2419000	2421000	Oh, Cender-Fella
2421000	2424000	They were like, they were like standups, they would have a whole Spoonerism act
2424000	2425000	What?
2425000	2429000	There we go, Fender-Cella was a, was a sin press
2429000	2431000	I don't, I don't think they would mix the words up
2431000	2436000	No, I know what Spoonerisms are, you flip the first word of two words, or the first letter
2436000	2440000	But then you have to know that's Cender-Fella, and then you have to care about that
2440000	2441000	And I'm like, uh
2441000	2446000	I, I, I saw, I saw a dude in Milwaukee, it was like an old-timer, and he did a whole standup act
2446000	2449000	He said, do you guys know where Spoonerisms are?
2449000	2452000	And the, and I was, I was at like a Def Jam show
2452000	2455000	Like, where Schwab and I were like, went there on a dare to each other
2455000	2458000	We were like, are we going to do the Def Jam open mic, and we both went
2458000	2459000	This is awesome
2459000	2462000	And, um, and at the time it was like, it was like a new concept, the Def Jam thing
2462000	2466000	And Schwab and I were very young, and I, I, I went out and was like
2466000	2470000	Yeah, I just played to my whiteness, and like, the, the Milwaukee black crowd was like
2470000	2473000	Totally respectful and supportive, because I was like, I was totally cheap
2473000	2475000	And was like, look at me, I'm the white guy
2475000	2480000	But there was like, uh, there was like, I remember there was this old guy that came out
2480000	2485000	And was like, just, he had no, it was like, he didn't know from, he didn't, there was
2485000	2490000	It was like Def Jam, I don't, it doesn't, he just came out and did this crazy, like, Catskills act
2490000	2494000	And he was like, have you folks heard of Spoonerisms?
2494000	2497000	And I remember, no, what is happening?
2497000	2500000	And he was like, a Spoonerism was what? And he explained what a Spoonerism was
2500000	2506000	And then he was like, I have a Spoonerism story, and then he told the story of Fendercella
2506000	2511000	And her, uh, Palette Pisters, whatever
2511000	2516000	I can't do, it's like he just went through the story of Cinderella, but like mixing the letters up
2516000	2517000	And she was Cinderfella
2517000	2518000	Yeah
2518000	2519000	For some reason
2519000	2521000	How did it, uh, how did it go over?
2521000	2525000	It was, it was, it was so weird
2525000	2529000	It was just, it was just like, people weren't heckling, because it's Milwaukee
2529000	2535000	And they were like, they were polite, and like, it was like a working class crowd
2535000	2540000	That was just like, who's this old dude? Like, why is he doing this? What is he doing?
2540000	2541000	I don't understand what's happening
2541000	2544000	Is he having a stroke? Like, what, what, why is he doing this?
2544000	2548000	Like, what, what is, is Fendercella gonna eat some pussy?
2548000	2553000	Like, like, like, I, it's Def Jam night at an already shitty comedy club
2553000	2558000	Like, what are we, what are we doing here? Why are we here?
2558000	2560000	Oh, great, if that had happened
2560000	2562000	And the guy just finished
2562000	2563000	Okay, so now
2563000	2566000	I think they were waiting, they were, they were like, I don't want to be, like, set up
2566000	2570000	Like, in the middle, he goes like, and then he ate some pussy and does a backflip
2570000	2573000	And, like, starts playing the violin with his balls
2573000	2578000	And, like, everyone's like, see, I was on his side from the beginning
2579000	2585000	But he just finished up and it was like, and then he got in a hearse and drove into a pit
2587000	2590000	The weird thing is, we had never, it was Milwaukee, so you think you know everybody
2590000	2592000	And then this guy just came out of nowhere
2592000	2594000	I think he might have been a ghost
2596000	2599000	I think his hair might have been snakes
2599000	2604000	Or, like, you go to his agent and go, hey, what was with that guy? Did you book him in the wrong room?
2604000	2607000	That guy died 30 years ago
2608000	2613000	If you listen closely, you can still hear his act in all black rooms
2615000	2617000	Why is that ghost up here again?
2618000	2620000	Why did he do that?
2620000	2623000	It's not the response you want from an audience
2623000	2626000	I'm just still stuck on this Fender Sella
2626000	2633000	Because I realize that the reason it's Fender Sella is because you have to put the F in there
2633000	2637000	Otherwise, there's nothing to spoonerize because it would just be Fender Sella
2637000	2638000	Which is just nothing
2638000	2641000	Like, that's spoonerizing with a non-present letter
2641000	2644000	Yeah, I don't know what to do with the old cube
2648000	2650000	What was wrong with the old cube?
2650000	2652000	It was small
2654000	2657000	I don't like the reaction that got
2658000	2660000	It made me feel insecure
2660000	2663000	Well, I think it's a, just don't, you're not going to drink out of this
2663000	2664000	You're not going to
2664000	2668000	No, no, I meant that you say it was too small, really, titillated people
2669000	2672000	Well, they were, because they were watching my, they were watching me the whole time
2672000	2675000	They were like, he's like a dumb monkey
2676000	2680000	How, and what have you managed to get to the new place, and why?
2680000	2685000	Like, what did you need that you were like, I gotta stop fucking around, I need knives
2685000	2688000	Can I tell one more story from that stand-up clip?
2688000	2689000	Of course, we'll get there
2689000	2692000	I have so much sense memory of that particular club
2692000	2694000	I can't remember its name, but it had the Def Jam night
2694000	2697000	And then it also would have like a regular comedy night
2697000	2699000	Like, ostensibly for white people, I don't know
2699000	2703000	But it's like, it was different, it was like, hey, anyone, please come
2704000	2706000	And I remember there was this magician
2706000	2709000	And he came there early
2709000	2712000	And I was like, I'm going to do my shitty stand-up act
2712000	2716000	And this magician who just like, he was one of two magicians in Milwaukee
2716000	2720000	And he was a constant presence at every open mic
2720000	2723000	And he had this whole thing set up
2723000	2727000	And he's like, Dan, I'm glad you're here
2727000	2731000	Sitting back, but right in the middle, right in the middle
2731000	2733000	And it was like this empty house, and I sat back
2733000	2736000	And then he's like, he played this like, Susie and the Banshees song
2736000	2737000	And I was like
2740000	2742000	Kiss them for me
2743000	2745000	And he made this like, handkerchief dance
2745000	2747000	And go in an aquarium
2747000	2749000	And then it came out of the aquarium
2749000	2752000	And he finished, he did the whole, he did this three-minute thing
2752000	2754000	Where he made this handkerchief dance
2754000	2756000	And I was like, really entertained by it
2756000	2759000	Because it's like, geez, the energy put into this guy
2759000	2762000	Like, pulling these strings with his hands on his
2762000	2764000	That are attached to his rings
2764000	2766000	And he's like, making this handkerchief dance
2766000	2768000	And I was like, that's impressive
2768000	2771000	And it was like, I was like, yeah, it's really cool
2771000	2772000	It's cool
2773000	2775000	That must have taken a lot of work
2775000	2778000	And he's like, yeah, yeah, I did it
2778000	2782000	And I was like, I don't know what I said
2782000	2785000	Where I was like, I didn't mean to, because I didn't realize
2787000	2791000	I didn't know that you weren't supposed to see the strings
2791000	2794000	Because that was the reason why he was making me sit somewhere
2794000	2796000	And he's like, just watch this, just watch this
2796000	2798000	And then I was like, that's cool
2798000	2800000	So the strings are just on your rings
2800000	2805000	Or whatever, and he was like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
2805000	2809000	He fucking, I've never seen a human being
2809000	2814000	He was like, ah, no, fuck
2814000	2817000	Because he had asked me to sit like, that chair
2817000	2819000	No, that chair, no, right to your left
2819000	2823000	So he must have been like, at least that person won't see them
2823000	2826000	Or was it like, that's the one chair left
2826000	2828000	Like, had he been there all night
2828000	2831000	And had he had his girlfriends in every chair
2831000	2836000	I just accidentally triggered a fucking meltdown
2836000	2838000	But it was crazy because I was impressed
2838000	2840000	I was like, well, that's fun
2840000	2843000	Like, a hanky on some strings tied to your rings
2843000	2845000	And they're like pulleys everywhere
2845000	2847000	And I was like, that's fun
2847000	2848000	Oh, it's fun
2848000	2853000	I don't have to believe that there's an angel helping you
2853000	2855000	Like, that's silly
2855000	2857000	I know that there's no ghosts
2857000	2858000	Happening
2858000	2861000	You literally were like, are those bunnies going to be safe in that box?
2861000	2865000	I really was not trying to be a dick, I swear
2865000	2866000	No, not at all
2866000	2869000	Because you were in love with the actual ballet of the whole situation
2869000	2872000	You didn't know people weren't supposed to see that shit
2872000	2876000	Back then, it was like, there was like a serious fucking turf war
2876000	2880000	Like, people, the stakes were high before karaoke wiped us all out
2882000	2883000	The
2883000	2884000	Magicians and puppets
2884000	2886000	They were people proud of their craft
2886000	2889000	And I remember a friend of mine
2889000	2892000	And everybody smoked back then and like
2892000	2895000	I've told this story before, but it was just like
2895000	2901000	Scenes from the class struggle in open mic comedy in Milwaukee in 1989
2901000	2905000	Like, there was a comic who
2905000	2907000	He was a magician, sorry
2907000	2909000	That's the whole point of the story
2909000	2911000	Never the twain shall meet
2911000	2915000	Somebody had broken into the safe house in Milwaukee
2915000	2920000	And in this place, there was this door that you could just kick in from the sidewalk
2920000	2921000	What's the safe house?
2921000	2924000	The safe house is like a tourist trap in Milwaukee
2924000	2926000	Which just sounds like such an oxymoron
2928000	2931000	Oh, it's one of those Milwaukee tourist traps, huh?
2931000	2934000	Hey, you're in Milwaukee, you'll pay anything
2935000	2938000	God knows you won't take your business to Chicago
2939000	2942000	But it was just sort of like, it was like this spy-themed bar
2942000	2945000	That had a secret entrance
2945000	2948000	And it had an open mic where you would perform for like
2948000	2954000	Up to five Austin businessmen who were sleeping off a red eye
2954000	2957000	He would just like practice dying in this place
2957000	2964000	And one of the magicians that stored their stuff
2965000	2970000	Somebody kicked in a door and the closest thing to the door was like a trunk full of magic shit
2970000	2972000	And they took it
2972000	2975000	And I came to the open mic night that night
2975000	2978000	And that magician was just like crying
2978000	2981000	And was like, you know, what the fuck?
2981000	2983000	They fucking took all my shit
2983000	2985000	It was fucking, it was like $5,000 worth of shit
2985000	2988000	Like all these, like genuinely had a bunch
2988000	2992000	And I just remember like my friend and mentor
2992000	2994000	A young comic but still way older than me
2994000	2996000	Because I was like 17 and like
2996000	3000000	He's got a camel light dangling from his lips
3000000	3002000	And he's like, he gets still smoking doors
3002000	3006000	And he's just like, oh, no, no, God, that's so, that's a fucking bummer
3006000	3008000	That's a bummer, man, a bummer
3008000	3010000	And the guy goes running off to like fret
3010000	3014000	And like talk to police or file his report about his magic trunk
3014000	3016000	And then he just turns to me and goes like,
3016000	3019000	That's what you get for being a fucking prop comic
3020000	3024000	And it was just said with no fucking humor
3024000	3028000	And nothing, it was just like, yeah, you fucking Hispanic
3028000	3032000	You know, it was just like this race war between performers
3032000	3034000	Like the fucking jet
3036000	3037000	You know, here's the thing
3037000	3039000	Like, here's the thing
3039000	3043000	Puppets, props, all that shit, big time war, gangs
3043000	3045000	Not a lot of places to perform
3045000	3047000	Don't want to follow a dude with a prop
3048000	3050000	But at the same time, sometimes good
3050000	3052000	Willie, Tyler, Lester, people
3053000	3055000	Puppets, not so bad
3055000	3057000	Puppet musicals, all sorts of shit
3057000	3058000	Henson, great
3058000	3060000	But here's the thing
3060000	3062000	Honor among comics
3062000	3064000	We don't shit on each other
3064000	3066000	If I think you're crazy
3066000	3069000	Because you have a credit card machine attached to your fucking briefcase
3069000	3070000	And that's a great bit for you
3070000	3072000	I'm not mad at you for that shit
3072000	3074000	I'm just thankful I don't have to carry that shit around
3074000	3079000	It was crazy, yeah, it was crazy how mad we'd get
3079000	3082000	About people who had like the same shtick or they had like
3082000	3083000	But they would kill
3083000	3084000	Yeah, it was like
3084000	3085000	It's because they would kill
3085000	3087000	Yeah, and it was like, oh, that doesn't deserve to kill
3087000	3088000	That's a bunch of bullshit
3088000	3090000	It was like, what are we striving for here?
3090000	3094000	We want to earn our keep because we want to suffer
3094000	3098000	Like, what did we, we worshiped Bill Hicks, you know
3098000	3099000	Everybody wanted to be Bill Hicks
3099000	3103000	Everybody wanted to be the truth bringer, the light giver
3103000	3107000	That perfect blend between like you've got a strong 45
3107000	3110000	But you're also like so fucking filled with rage
3110000	3113000	But it's like, not everybody's filled with rage
3113000	3116000	Like that was the fucked up thing is everybody wanted to be angry
3116000	3120000	And everybody wanted to kill and like not die
3120000	3122000	And yeah, it was very easy
3122000	3124000	There was, everybody wanted to be Bill Hicks
3124000	3127000	And a lot of people would have been better Stephen Wright
3127000	3131000	Yeah, like a lot of people were like cornball, cutesy, funny
3131000	3134000	And we would, we would, we would ridicule them
3134000	3135000	Yeah
3135000	3137000	Because if they were too cutesy or something
3137000	3138000	If they were too PG
3138000	3139000	Yeah
3139000	3140000	People that didn't work blue
3140000	3141000	Sometimes you'd respect them
3141000	3144000	But they'd have to fucking murder in order for you to respect them
3144000	3145000	If they don't work blue
3145000	3147000	Because it's like, what are you trying to say?
3147000	3149000	You're not allowed to say fuck
3149000	3150000	You're in a fucking bar
3150000	3155000	Like, just like the crazy factionalism is so entertaining to me now looking back
3155000	3161000	But what's really funny about it is like we, the presupposition was that one tribe was gonna win out
3161000	3168000	And what's funny is that they like, I was there for the karaoke machines being rolled in one by one
3168000	3172000	And it was like, it used to be comedy versus darts
3172000	3176000	It was like, like, like my friend Sean McKenna at the LA freeway
3176000	3179000	Which was a Milwaukee like bar that I did my first open mic
3179000	3183000	He was like, he would, he would say, hey, it's open mic night folks
3184000	3186000	And you know that because you can't play darts
3186000	3188000	And then it was like, it was true
3188000	3190000	It was like, that was the big problem with it
3190000	3192000	It was like, well, there's a microphone in front of the dartboard
3192000	3198000	So, and then, but then five years later, it was like, they're just these dudes with mustaches
3198000	3203000	Like rolling in with these dollies of weird sci-fi equipment
3203000	3204000	It was like, what is that?
3204000	3205000	It's karaoke
3205000	3206000	What does that mean?
3206000	3207000	Yeah
3207000	3208000	Karaoke
3208000	3209000	Yeah
3209000	3212000	It's a Japanese thing where you sing other people's songs
3212000	3216000	And it was like, the fuck is this? A year later, done
3216000	3221000	Everyone get, like, why would the Holiday Inn next to the airport
3221000	3228000	Ever want a fucking alcoholic slob to berate the people waiting in the lobby
3228000	3231000	If they can replace them for 20% less
3231000	3235000	With a fucking music machine that lets them sing I Will Survive
3235000	3239000	Like, we'll make them come in by the droves
3239000	3244000	It was just, like, this crazy Boogie Nights thing of, like, oh, you've been replaced with joy
3244000	3245000	You've been replaced
3245000	3247000	All of your conversations about what's hack
3247000	3249000	Oh, that guy's act is hack
3249000	3251000	Because he's above the belt
3251000	3252000	And he doesn't work blue
3252000	3253000	He's too blue
3253000	3255000	Oh, he's ripping off Andrew Dice Clay
3255000	3257000	He's ripping off Kevin...
3257000	3258000	Durant
3258000	3259000	Sarbo
3259000	3260000	Durant
3262000	3264000	Kevin Sarbo
3264000	3266000	All that Hercules stuff
3267000	3269000	That would be impressive
3269000	3271000	And that just all wiped out
3271000	3274000	Wiped out by this other thing that we never had a chance to factionalize
3274000	3276000	We never were like, oh, singing people
3276000	3279000	We were all extinct like that
3279000	3280000	That was funny
3280000	3284000	Alright, anyways, you were asking me a provocative question about moving
3284000	3288000	About what it takes to make the list to be transferred
3288000	3289000	Yeah, I don't know
3289000	3292000	And that's the weird zen tales bin I'm in
3292000	3294000	I wake up in the morning and I go
3294000	3296000	I need shit in this house
3296000	3297000	And then I'm like
3297000	3299000	What shit are you going to put in this house?
3299000	3300000	And then I'm like
3300000	3301000	I don't know
3301000	3302000	A microphone?
3302000	3303000	Because I'm good
3303000	3304000	Yeah
3304000	3305000	But I'm like
3305000	3308000	Do you talk to your therapist about this?
3308000	3310000	I haven't really yet
3310000	3312000	That could be fun
3312000	3314000	Might get you a couple more weeks
3314000	3315000	She would just say
3315000	3317000	She'll be like, yeah, take your microphone
3317000	3320000	She would just say, oh, that's, well, that's where you're at, you know
3320000	3322000	Like, I think that's really profound
3322000	3323000	Like, that's where you're at
3323000	3324000	I'm going to need a little more
3324000	3325000	You're changing
3325000	3326000	You're changing
3326000	3327000	You know, she's really into it
3327000	3332000	Like, we have a shorthand like shit we go like, oh, that's not who Dan Heller is
3332000	3333000	Like, because I'm like
3333000	3335000	Like, whether I would literally take Cody's name or not
3335000	3338000	I like the idea that I'm Dan Heller now
3338000	3339000	Yeah
3339000	3340000	Or like, I'm not Dan Heller yet
3340000	3342000	Because I like, I keep fucking up
3342000	3344000	Like, but I like to think in my head
3344000	3347000	Like, I'm turning into a different guy
3347000	3348000	Yeah
3348000	3349000	In my older age
3349000	3351000	Joseph Campbell talks about that
3351000	3355000	Like, in like tribal cultures, there's like, you know, old men
3355000	3357000	They, they get reborn
3357000	3359000	They change the way they dress at a certain age
3359000	3362000	And they go from being like, they'll actually change their identity
3362000	3363000	Yeah
3363000	3367000	They'll be like, oh, I was, I was fucking kicking bird
3367000	3371000	But now I'm like screaming, screaming stereotype
3371000	3381000	Screaming stereotype, give me your wisdom
3381000	3384000	Well, I, I don't have that much
3384000	3391000	I'm just a, I'm just an iCloud of tropes that Dan Harmon got from five movies
3391000	3397000	I thought it would be, uh, uh, eat, eat laxatives and get off my lawn
3397000	3405000	But that is the thing, like think, I mean that, like, like Western culture, you go, like, that's what we totally deny ourselves
3405000	3409000	We deny ourselves the right, I was, I was on Duncan Trussell's podcast recently
3409000	3413000	And we talked a lot about the right to change your mind, how we punish it
3413000	3414000	How, and it's like
3414000	3415000	Yeah, that is true
3415000	3420000	Like, like, like, we especially, like, like, we definitely do not want
3420000	3426000	And it, it, it, it's something that, that occurred to me is that, like, all the endless debate and investigation that we commit
3426000	3432000	To the idea of nature versus nurture, which is totally valid, like, that's, of course, that's a
3432000	3436000	Totally, like, that's of academic interest, nature or nurture
3436000	3443000	Did your mom's genes make you a serial killer or was it the thing your mom made you eat?
3443000	3444000	Um, but
3444000	3446000	Either way it was your mama, got that
3446000	3448000	Exactly, either way it wasn't you
3448000	3450000	Either way it wasn't you
3450000	3454000	And that's the thing that we, it's, it's profound how much we debate about nature versus nurture
3454000	3457000	But we don't debate about will versus free will that much
3457000	3464000	You have to, like, sign up for a weird, unmarketable college class in order to have these conversations about
3464000	3471000	Are we choosing anything ever? Or are we just products of a bunch of fucking shit that's either nature and or nurture
3471000	3474000	But do we, do we actually, like
3474000	3477000	See, I fucks with that argument constantly
3477000	3481000	The do we choose, can we move, can we make our own way sort of thing
3481000	3485000	And it is weird because to a certain degree we do sort of choose
3485000	3487000	Is my, is my thought
3487000	3491000	I side with that because the alternative is going insane
3491000	3496000	Like, you're just like a choo-choo train going around a Christmas tree called God's board
3496000	3498000	Yeah
3498000	3500000	For no reason
3500000	3504000	And you're just like, oh, I feel like I'm choosing whole wheat over rye
3504000	3508000	And God's like, nope, that's your fucking dopamine, you idiot
3508000	3510000	Fucking little clockwork man
3510000	3511000	Yeah
3511000	3515000	Way to choose wheat this time, you fucking matchbox car
3515000	3520000	Also, so boring to watch us if we were constantly making the wrong choices
3520000	3524000	Like, be just watching a tragedy day after day
3524000	3527000	So in order for it to be a sitcom and fun to watch
3527000	3529000	There's a little bit of free will that goes on
3529000	3532000	But there's a certain amount of fucking up that also is part of it
3532000	3537000	I like this idea that there's free will is an illusion and God is watching that
3538000	3541000	He's the, because the choice on him is
3541000	3542000	Why did I do this?
3542000	3543000	This is a
3543000	3546000	But that is like an old man watching a model train
3546000	3552000	Like, you set up a model train set and then you watch it go around and do exactly what you anticipated it would do
3552000	3554000	And if it fucks up, you fix it
3554000	3561000	Like, if the train makes its own decision, you call that my, I fucked up making my model train
3562000	3565000	My understanding was, I read in the past that
3565000	3570000	Science, scientists generally have formed the consensus that free will is an illusion
3570000	3574000	But if you think about that, it doesn't help
3574000	3577000	So for all intents and purposes, it's not
3577000	3579000	But scientifically, it is
3579000	3584000	Which means that, like, I think that means that astrology is real, right?
3586000	3588000	I mean, it's the equivalent for sure
3589000	3591000	Yeah, because it's like, I was just born like this
3591000	3597000	Yeah, so, oh, so I'm just a guy who was born in this house on this date
3597000	3601000	And then my mom did this, and then my dad did this, and then the school I went to, this happened
3601000	3603000	And licorice was in season
3603000	3604000	Right
3604000	3608000	And so here I am doing this podcast saying these words that I'm about to say
3608000	3611000	There they go, there go those words that I was already about to say
3612000	3613000	That's so
3613000	3614000	I mean, I guess that's what Westworld was about
3614000	3616000	Maybe that was a good season
3617000	3620000	I thought it was a bag of shit
3620000	3622000	Maybe it was profound
3622000	3624000	Oh, I just got it, the piano roll
3624000	3625000	Oh, shit
3625000	3627000	Was that your ring?
3628000	3629000	Yeah
3629000	3633000	Dan's ring flew off for the folks at home
3633000	3635000	Who applauded my ring flying off?
3635000	3637000	Fucking incels
3638000	3640000	They're everywhere
3642000	3645000	Finding love is the worst thing that ever happened to you
3646000	3656000	You think that magician, like, that's always how he reacts to people getting his allusions?
3656000	3659000	It's like, yeah, you just put that card there
3659000	3660000	Fuck!
3663000	3666000	That's like, it's a bad temperament for a magician, I think
3666000	3668000	Well, it's a bad temperament, really
3668000	3670000	I saw the inside of his apartment once
3670000	3671000	Oh, no
3671000	3672000	What?
3672000	3676000	And I will never trust magicians again
3676000	3680000	I was like, whoa, there's the trick
3680000	3681000	Yeah
3682000	3688000	You being out in society is the prestige
3688000	3694000	This is a temple to self-abuse
3694000	3699000	And also you have a living girlfriend who, of course, is your assistant
3699000	3704000	And if she stops being your assistant, there will be a new girlfriend and she will be your assistant
3704000	3706000	Because the other one escaped
3708000	3718000	Because she, unlike these dying doves in this cage who are just wondering, am I next for the sleeve?
3721000	3727000	There could be a Pixar movie that's like yellow feathered doves in this lightless apartment
3727000	3730000	Going like, dude, you're going in the sleeve next
3731000	3733000	You hear that phone call? That was his manager
3733000	3736000	You're going to Toronto, you're going in the sleeve
3736000	3737000	God damn
3737000	3740000	You're going in the fucking dove holster
3741000	3743000	You're not gonna make it
3745000	3747000	Holy shit
3747000	3751000	The blackness, the dark fucking hole
3751000	3752000	Of course
3753000	3761000	Because I think when you're a magician, you do have license to justify your apartment being caked in debris
3761000	3764000	You can go, well, that's a bunch of magic newspaper
3766000	3768000	I can't throw that away
3768000	3769000	I might have to pour milk
3769000	3771000	I might need that to pour milk in
3775000	3777000	Oh, man, that's awesome
3777000	3779000	Which is junky as fuck
3780000	3782000	In that broken refrigerator
3783000	3784000	God damn
3784000	3788000	No, not a magician, an open mic magician
3788000	3789000	God damn
3789000	3790000	That's dark as fuck
3790000	3792000	Yeah, I mean, but have you, I mean
3792000	3795000	That's like okay for the clan to hate darkness
3797000	3799000	Which only happens if you're really dark, right?
3799000	3800000	Yeah, yeah
3800000	3802000	Justifiable
3803000	3805000	Well, okay, so just to understand
3805000	3810000	I'm not trying to gotcha journalism, but I understood that your apartment was pretty messy
3810000	3813000	So how did this make an impact on you?
3813000	3814000	I think that
3814000	3817000	Well, animals obviously is a huge step
3817000	3819000	No, you're absolutely right
3819000	3822000	I mean, I ended up living in just as much filth as a magician
3822000	3826000	Oh, but you, so at the time you made that judgment, you had a better place
3826000	3831000	I had the privilege of being a college dropout who was like basically still living with
3831000	3833000	I was just living like a college kid
3833000	3838000	I was going from a dorm room to like, oh, hey, can I crash in your attic?
3838000	3841000	And so I didn't have enough stuff to be filthy
3841000	3842000	Right
3842000	3844000	I would definitely graduate to that very quickly
3844000	3845000	You're absolutely right
3845000	3846000	Gotcha
3846000	3847000	I said it was a gotcha
3847000	3848000	It was
3848000	3849000	No, I'm kidding, sorry
3849000	3850000	I just wanted to, cause I don't know
3850000	3853000	It sounded obviously like sad animals
3853000	3856000	And then the mess they make is definitely like a level above
3856000	3857000	But I was just trying to understand
3857000	3860000	Cause it sounded like it wasn't necessarily the level of mess
3860000	3862000	But then you were saying stuff that indicated it might've been
3862000	3863000	Anyway
3863000	3864000	Yeah
3864000	3865000	What's uh, have you like a
3865000	3866000	Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold
3866000	3870000	Buffalo, why did you go O wings?
3870000	3871000	Yes
3871000	3872000	What made you
3872000	3873000	I was just a kid
3873000	3874000	Because you knew it
3874000	3875000	I was like Bob Dylan
3875000	3876000	I was trying to learn about
3876000	3880000	I don't know, I would pick somebody up, drive them to a gig
3880000	3882000	I can't remember honestly
3882000	3883000	You were being nice
3883000	3888000	I would like, I was like, I'm focusing on my comedy
3888000	3890000	So I'm like in it to win it
3890000	3891000	I don't know, I was in the biz
3892000	3893000	I just wondered
3893000	3896000	I can't, maybe I would pick, maybe I was picking him up
3896000	3898000	Maybe my car was working and his wasn't
3898000	3902000	Maybe, maybe, maybe we were gonna write a script together
3902000	3903000	I have no idea
3903000	3904000	I can't remember
3904000	3905000	But it is, yeah it is
3905000	3908000	But I mean, yeah, in terms of overall filth
3908000	3911000	Not as meaningful as much as like these guys
3911000	3913000	They perform in these fancy costumes
3913000	3915000	And they have names like The Great Zander
3915000	3916000	And like
3918000	3920000	To a man they do not
3921000	3925000	Don't live in a loft that's immaculate
3925000	3927000	And there's like, oh my illusion chest
3927000	3931000	It's like, no, it's just a fucking filth nest
3931000	3935000	Because how else are you gonna learn to roll quarters on your knuckles
3935000	3937000	It's not by cleaning up
3938000	3941000	You have to sit and eat string cheese
3941000	3943000	And let the wrapper fall out of your mouth
3943000	3946000	If you want to get the jump on the other magicians
3946000	3949000	That are practicing just as much quarter rolling on the knuckles
3949000	3952000	You have to sit there and fucking like flip cards over and over again
3952000	3955000	You're gonna watch Columbo and collect mucus
3955000	3957000	No, these tricks
3957000	3959000	You can learn these tricks
3959000	3961000	You don't need to like suffer for them
3961000	3962000	You have to practice that shit
3962000	3963000	I mean, practice
3963000	3964000	It's manual dexterity
3964000	3967000	But it's not like a gymnast house has diarrhea all up there
3968000	3970000	Maybe you don't know any good gymnasts
3970000	3974000	A gymnast house has fucking emotional trauma all over it
3974000	3976000	Because they're 11 years old
3976000	3980000	And their soul's been shattered because they have no agency
3980000	3982000	He was supposed to have a workshop
3982000	3984000	Or like a magic shop
3984000	3987000	Yeah, that's what it would be in the Columbo episode
3987000	3988000	Where the suspect was a magician
3988000	3990000	And they'd be like, welcome to my loft
3990000	3991000	There's my freight elevator
3991000	3993000	And here's my guillotine trick
3993000	3996000	And because a production designer designed my nest
3996000	3998000	There's not shit everywhere
3998000	4001000	But the truth is, dirty people
4001000	4003000	Dirty people
4004000	4006000	And high suicide rate, too
4006000	4007000	Yeah
4007000	4008000	Yeah
4011000	4013000	There was a magician that worked at the same pass
4013000	4015000	And his car was in the parking lot
4015000	4017000	It was very clear he was living in it
4018000	4019000	And it was like
4019000	4020000	He's still like
4020000	4023000	They wear like three-piece suits and like ties
4023000	4024000	But it was like
4024000	4026000	Then they get in this like Dennis Woodruff station wagon
4026000	4028000	With a portal hanging off the back
4028000	4031000	And like a fucking bag of pee on the handle
4033000	4035000	I love how we started off
4035000	4037000	Started off saying
4037000	4038000	Hey, we're all equal
4042000	4044000	And then by the time we were done like
4044000	4047000	Lousy fucking magicians with the
4047000	4049000	Fucking pigeons and dirty
4049000	4050000	I am fascinated with people that go into the
4050000	4053000	It's like in a world where like
4053000	4055000	It's like, oh, I'm going to lie to people
4055000	4056000	Yeah
4056000	4058000	I don't want to get better at that
4058000	4060000	I'm not dishonest enough
4060000	4061000	Yeah
4061000	4062000	It's real good
4062000	4064000	What our friend Asperger detective would
4064000	4066000	Call redirecting light
4066000	4068000	Like I'm going to make you think
4068000	4071000	This handkerchief is floating because God is real
4072000	4074000	I'm not content to just be like
4074000	4076000	Check out my fucking thing where I like
4076000	4079000	Put these wires and I made this handkerchief
4079000	4081000	Again, like, I mean
4082000	4084000	God bless, but God damn
4092000	4095000	That's the title, right?
4096000	4098000	That should be the title of the podcast
4098000	4099000	God bless, but
4099000	4103000	It breaks my heart to feel bad for a magician
4105000	4106000	God damn
4107000	4109000	That's like when you find out that shit about
4109000	4111000	People at Disney and they're like puking in the heads
4111000	4113000	And there's catacombs underneath
4113000	4115000	Where they feel like they have to
4115000	4117000	They have to eat this burrito really fast
4117000	4119000	So I can get outside and do the business
4119000	4121000	And you're like, damn Disney
4121000	4122000	Yeah
4122000	4123000	Damn
4123000	4125000	Or like, Ballerina's feet are all mashed up
4125000	4126000	Yeah
4126000	4128000	Well, that's worth it
4128000	4130000	Well, it's working, yeah, but I'm saying
4130000	4132000	It's sad to find out, you're like
4132000	4134000	Oh, you're so beautiful, you're jumping over
4134000	4136000	Yeah, my feet are all purple
4136000	4137000	Yeah
4137000	4139000	Everybody should have to know
4139000	4141000	What every other profession goes through
4141000	4143000	Just to do the shit
4143000	4145000	Or you go like, what a beautiful breed of dog
4145000	4147000	Yeah, well, it's bread for fucking
4147000	4149000	You have to clean its sinuses out with a q-tip
4149000	4151000	Or it'll die overnight
4151000	4152000	Yeah
4153000	4155000	Because someone in England thought their faces
4155000	4157000	Lipped adorable that way
4157000	4158000	We are
4158000	4159000	That's a mush-faced dog
4159000	4161000	It can't really breathe on its own
4161000	4163000	And it needs a CPAP machine
4164000	4166000	Ask me how I got its tail to curl
4167000	4168000	I dare you
4169000	4170000	The hot iron
4170000	4171000	Yeah
4171000	4173000	It involves thousands and thousands of years
4173000	4175000	Of a hot iron
4176000	4178000	And then dangling it in a well
4178000	4180000	I mean, that's dogs in general
4180000	4181000	Dogs are
4181000	4182000	That's the ultimate
4182000	4184000	Dogs are the ultimate magician
4185000	4187000	Because they're like
4187000	4189000	A humankind's best friend
4189000	4191000	And they're so emotionally attached to us
4191000	4194000	And they're like, oh my god, what a bond we have with you
4194000	4196000	And then you open the hood on that
4196000	4198000	And you're like, oh god, yeah, it's because
4198000	4201000	Every single time one of your brothers or sisters
4201000	4204000	Disappointed a caveman, they threw him on the fire
4204000	4206000	And then the ones that were left
4206000	4207000	Were allowed to breed
4207000	4208000	And it's just like
4208000	4210000	Now you get all these different shaped fucking things
4210000	4213000	And like, oh, this one's used to clean cannons out
4213000	4215000	In fucking Brunswick
4216000	4220000	It was bread for the deformity of its front arms
4220000	4222000	And it's like, it can't
4223000	4225000	It gets more lung cancer than usual
4225000	4226000	But
4226000	4227000	It's true
4227000	4228000	Boy, can it clean out a cannon
4229000	4232000	And it'll get those ferrets right out of your Bastille
4232000	4233000	Right
4234000	4236000	At first prize, look at it trot
4236000	4237000	Like
4240000	4242000	You know, they have special muscles
4242000	4243000	On the inside of their brow
4243000	4244000	That make them more expressive
4244000	4245000	That wolves don't have
4245000	4248000	Wolves can only look like they're gonna eat you
4248000	4250000	Almost identical DNA
4250000	4252000	But like dogs are just like
4252000	4253000	The fucking thing
4253000	4255000	Like it's like different breed of canine
4255000	4256000	Since you have said that
4256000	4257000	When I listen to you talk
4257000	4259000	I try to not do that
4260000	4261000	What?
4261000	4262000	My natural
4262000	4264000	To look at me like you're gonna eat me
4264000	4265000	I think all people
4265000	4266000	When somebody's talking to you
4266000	4267000	They're like
4267000	4268000	You'd be like
4268000	4269000	Yeah, I went and got some beer
4269000	4270000	And they're like
4270000	4271000	Oh yeah, yeah, what happened?
4271000	4273000	But since you have said that to me
4273000	4274000	I've been really conscious of like
4274000	4275000	Yeah, that won't happen
4279000	4281000	You're trying to look like a wolf?
4282000	4284000	Or are you trying to look like a dog?
4284000	4285000	I've told you Dan
4285000	4287000	I don't always know what's gonna happen
4288000	4290000	But you're conscious of your brown now
4290000	4291000	It's been cool for like
4291000	4292000	Thirteen years
4292000	4294000	But one day
4294000	4295000	I may have to bite ya
4297000	4298000	Well yeah
4300000	4302000	I'm hard pressed to know
4302000	4305000	Like do I respect wolves more than dogs?
4305000	4306000	Yeah, you respect wolves
4306000	4307000	Because wolves are like
4307000	4308000	You know you said
4308000	4310000	There's a documentary about
4310000	4311000	They compare the two
4311000	4314000	And then they put the little treat under the cup
4314000	4315000	And the wolves just like
4315000	4316000	They know the treats under the cup
4316000	4317000	And they paw at it
4317000	4318000	And they're like
4318000	4319000	I'm a wolf
4319000	4320000	And I get the cup
4320000	4321000	And it's like
4322000	4323000	And then the dog
4323000	4325000	Will try for the cup
4325000	4326000	And it stops
4326000	4328000	And it looks at the nearest person
4328000	4329000	Because it's like
4329000	4331000	Excuse me but
4333000	4335000	I did my best
4336000	4337000	And it's like
4337000	4338000	I don't
4338000	4340000	Are we on the side of that or not?
4340000	4342000	Is it the shadow we cast or is it
4342000	4343000	It's just crazy
4343000	4344000	It's like
4345000	4348000	It's a strange poetic relationship
4350000	4351000	It is, it's great that like
4352000	4353000	We needed something
4353000	4355000	And that something kind of also needed us
4355000	4356000	It's weird when you're like
4356000	4357000	Dog walks over to you
4357000	4358000	And puts its head on you
4359000	4360000	Because you're like
4360000	4361000	Oh man we get along
4361000	4362000	And we don't speak
4362000	4363000	The same language
4364000	4366000	You could have left a long time ago
4366000	4367000	You could have changed your mind
4367000	4369000	And bit my face off a long time ago
4369000	4370000	And it's dope
4370000	4371000	It's kind of the
4371000	4373000	It's kind of the coolest thing
4373000	4374000	That man did
4374000	4375000	Or woman did
4375000	4376000	For each other
4376000	4377000	Thousands of years ago
4377000	4378000	They're like
4378000	4379000	In the future you're going to need a dog
4379000	4381000	When I first moved to the new house
4381000	4384000	There was this moment that I never had with Harvey
4384000	4385000	Where like
4385000	4386000	He, it wasn't
4386000	4387000	He didn't really
4387000	4388000	He's not like
4388000	4389000	This is my house
4389000	4390000	And it's not
4390000	4391000	For all he knows
4391000	4392000	I'm just like
4392000	4393000	You know
4393000	4394000	Their dogs are just like
4394000	4396000	I'm sure they get a sense of like
4396000	4397000	Sort of like
4397000	4398000	Oh this is my new bro
4398000	4399000	This is my new den
4399000	4400000	But he just
4400000	4401000	He's like
4401000	4402000	Well I'm with you
4402000	4403000	You're my man
4403000	4404000	And I'm your dog
4404000	4405000	And we're here together
4405000	4406000	And I kind of like
4406000	4408000	It just kind of organically happened
4408000	4410000	That he and I like
4410000	4413000	Walked the perimeter of my house together
4413000	4414000	And he just like
4414000	4416000	There was no leash or anything
4416000	4417000	It was just sort of night time
4417000	4418000	And he
4418000	4420000	He just like
4420000	4421000	Fell into this behavior
4421000	4422000	That was like
4422000	4424000	And that I fell into too
4424000	4425000	Where I was like
4425000	4426000	It just felt so right
4426000	4427000	It felt like
4427000	4428000	Lifting a hammer
4428000	4429000	Or a gazelle femur
4429000	4430000	Like
4430000	4431000	It was like
4431000	4432000	I'm this sentient primate
4432000	4434000	And I just had this like
4434000	4436000	Retriever at my hip
4436000	4437000	And he just
4437000	4438000	Kept perfect pace with me
4438000	4439000	And he kind of like
4439000	4440000	It was as if he understood
4440000	4441000	That what we were doing
4441000	4442000	Is we were just sort of
4442000	4443000	Checking the perimeter
4443000	4444000	And he
4444000	4445000	It was
4445000	4448000	Something just swelled inside me
4448000	4450000	I think it's very notable though
4450000	4451000	That like
4451000	4452000	You know
4452000	4453000	I don't know what the numbers are
4453000	4454000	Like let's say
4454000	4455000	50,000 years of dog domestication
4455000	4456000	Versus the
4456000	4458000	10,000 years of cat
4458000	4459000	Infestation
4459000	4461000	And I say that very affectionately
4461000	4462000	As a former cat person
4463000	4464000	I just like
4464000	4466000	Cats if you ask them
4466000	4467000	Are you domesticated
4467000	4468000	They would say
4468000	4470000	No, thank you very much sir
4470000	4472000	I am not a domesticated animal
4472000	4474000	I've chosen to live among humans
4474000	4476000	Because it profits me
4476000	4478000	And unlike dogs
4478000	4479000	Cats don't
4479000	4481000	They come in some different shapes
4481000	4482000	And furs and things
4482000	4483000	But they're basically cats
4483000	4485000	And when we go into outer space
4485000	4487000	We're going to bring dogs and cats
4487000	4489000	And it
4489000	4491000	Cats didn't
4492000	4493000	Kiss as much ass
4493000	4494000	As dogs did
4494000	4496000	And they're still coming on the arc
4496000	4497000	For sure
4497000	4499000	And I find that kind of interesting
4499000	4500000	Because also what I find interesting
4500000	4501000	Humans love cats
4501000	4502000	As much as they love dogs
4502000	4503000	We
4503000	4505000	Maybe if you could quantify that
4505000	4506000	That might not be true
4506000	4507000	But like we
4507000	4508000	We
4508000	4509000	We will bring
4509000	4510000	In the way that matters
4510000	4511000	We will bring cats with us
4511000	4512000	To outer space
4512000	4513000	If we survive
4513000	4514000	And like
4514000	4515000	Like
4515000	4516000	We love cats
4516000	4517000	Because they're soft
4517000	4518000	And they
4518000	4519000	They react to us
4519000	4520000	Loving them
4520000	4521000	And they're
4521000	4522000	And like
4522000	4523000	It's almost like dogs
4523000	4526000	Didn't have to go as far as they did
4528000	4529000	It's almost like we
4529000	4530000	As humans were like
4530000	4531000	You know what?
4531000	4532000	You could have split the diff
4532000	4534000	And we would have might have respected you more
4534000	4536000	You could have nagged us a little bit
4536000	4537000	And the dogs were like
4537000	4538000	I figured it out
4538000	4539000	Whatever you say, boss
4539000	4540000	And we're like
4540000	4542000	Alright, dial it back
4543000	4545000	This guy catches mice
4545000	4546000	And he purrs
4546000	4547000	That's it
4547000	4548000	Like he can shit where he wants
4548000	4549000	He shits in a box
4549000	4552000	How's that for fucking consideration
4552000	4553000	Yeah
4553000	4555000	It's interesting
4555000	4557000	Because humans are very self-loathing
4557000	4558000	Which is why we
4558000	4559000	I think we reach out
4559000	4562000	Every animal that we ever touched
4562000	4564000	I'm sure we tried to domesticate
4564000	4565000	We come across an elephant
4565000	4566000	We probably were like
4566000	4568000	Oh, can you have one as a pet?
4568000	4569000	And the answer is no
4569000	4570000	You can't
4570000	4571000	Because they're smarter
4571000	4572000	And they have graveyards
4572000	4573000	I don't know
4574000	4576000	You can't have an elephant as a pet
4576000	4577000	You can't
4577000	4578000	What if this elephant
4578000	4579000	I breed it with that elephant
4579000	4580000	It's going to still be an elephant
4580000	4581000	And it's going to be mad at you
4581000	4582000	And step on you
4583000	4584000	Or it's going to be sad
4584000	4585000	And step on a stool
4585000	4586000	And cry and then die
4586000	4589000	And it'll remember where it died
4589000	4591000	And all the other elephants will go
4592000	4593000	And a scientist will go
4593000	4594000	They're all sad
4594000	4595000	And we'll all cry
4597000	4598000	Not a pet
4598000	4599000	Not a pet
4600000	4601000	You know, we try ferrets
4601000	4602000	We try lizards
4602000	4603000	Yeah, with the bite
4603000	4605000	Everybody needs a carnie in their life
4605000	4606000	But
4607000	4610000	It's because we hate ourselves
4610000	4612000	You know, we're not
4612000	4616000	What other animal species is so insecure
4616000	4617000	That they're like
4617000	4619000	Anybody else want to party?
4620000	4621000	That's fucking crazy
4621000	4623000	You're either eating some shit
4623000	4624000	Or it's eating you
4624000	4627000	That's the general rule in the animal kingdom
4627000	4629000	There's some ants that milk some aphids
4629000	4630000	I get you
4630000	4631000	And there's capybaras
4631000	4633000	I'm picking up what you're laying down
4633000	4635000	There's some crocodile birds
4635000	4637000	Eating out the teeth
4637000	4638000	I got you, player
4641000	4643000	That's the interspecies opening line
4645000	4646000	Are you a shark?
4646000	4647000	I see you shark
4647000	4648000	I got that shark
4648000	4649000	There's some general mishegasque going on
4649000	4650000	Between a couple species
4650000	4651000	Oh, this spider lays an egg
4651000	4653000	And the egg looks like a fruit
4653000	4654000	And the fruit makes the pollen
4654000	4655000	Or whatever
4655000	4657000	But, you know, only us are like
4657000	4658000	Who wants to party?
4658000	4659000	Yeah
4659000	4660000	I'm so alone
4660000	4661000	Wilson
4662000	4663000	We share food
4663000	4664000	Yeah
4664000	4666000	We fucking will give up food
4666000	4667000	Yeah
4667000	4669000	That's a big fucking deal to animals
4669000	4671000	But then only dogs are like
4671000	4673000	Oh shit, that's a human baby
4673000	4674000	However, actually
4674000	4677000	Oh shit, this is a thing I could have written down
4677000	4678000	Okay, so
4678000	4680000	Damn, we filled some time
4680000	4682000	In my new house
4682000	4686000	There is this species of bird
4686000	4687000	Oh
4687000	4688000	Very interesting
4688000	4690000	There's a couple of neighborhood cats
4690000	4693000	And there's also this weird species of bird
4693000	4694000	That I don't see a lot
4694000	4696000	They have like very long tails
4696000	4698000	They kind of look like
4698000	4699000	Sorry, what?
4699000	4701000	Peek
4701000	4702000	Peek
4702000	4704000	That would be cool
4709000	4712000	Okay, I love three things about that
4712000	4714000	I love that you're British
4714000	4716000	I love that you
4718000	4719000	And I was like
4719000	4721000	In the place I moved
4721000	4722000	There's these birds with long tails
4722000	4723000	The peacock
4723000	4724000	Right
4724000	4725000	And then I was like
4725000	4726000	Sorry, what?
4726000	4727000	And you're like
4727000	4728000	Sorry, peacock
4729000	4730000	Yeah, you can see it too
4730000	4731000	The second time I'm like
4731000	4732000	I'm sorry
4732000	4733000	I'm sorry
4733000	4734000	I just
4734000	4735000	I hit the buzzer too early
4735000	4738000	You probably didn't move
4738000	4739000	To a zoo
4742000	4743000	Yeah
4744000	4745000	Where I used to live
4745000	4746000	There was peacocks
4746000	4747000	In like the hills
4747000	4748000	Like ranch property
4748000	4749000	And I'd drive down there
4749000	4750000	Just to see them like
4750000	4751000	They'd jump up on a house
4751000	4752000	And be like
4752000	4753000	Holy shit
4753000	4754000	Wait, well like Simi Valley?
4754000	4755000	Yeah, and Simi Valley
4755000	4757000	Oh, okay, so I apologize, sir
4757000	4758000	That then
4758000	4760000	So it's not a crazy thing to be like peacock
4760000	4761000	Well, to me it indicated
4761000	4763000	He thought you moved somewhere really rich
4763000	4764000	Yeah, okay
4764000	4765000	Like a really rural
4765000	4766000	Like out in the outskirts
4766000	4767000	Like shadow hills
4767000	4768000	And there's peacocks out there
4768000	4769000	Yeah
4769000	4770000	Okay, all right, sorry
4770000	4771000	Maybe, I don't know
4771000	4772000	I didn't mean to mock you
4772000	4773000	I meant to mock you
4773000	4774000	But I didn't have all the information
4774000	4775000	I needed to mock you
4775000	4777000	And shouldn't have mocked you
4777000	4778000	That's what I mean
4778000	4780000	The delivery did deserve mockery
4780000	4781000	Oh, it was fun
4781000	4782000	It was funny
4782000	4785000	In my mind, peacocks are like tigers
4785000	4788000	They only exist in a zoo or a foreign land
4788000	4789000	Yeah
4789000	4791000	That's my own ignorance, apparently
4791000	4792000	They're all over
4792000	4795000	Like you think I'm like Aquaman or something
4795000	4796000	Like oh, he must have moved
4796000	4797000	To the sea
4797000	4798000	To like Xanadu
4798000	4801000	Anyway, sorry
4801000	4802000	Mataré
4802000	4804000	No, they're like regular looking birds
4804000	4805000	That fly around
4805000	4808000	Float, float, flappy, flappy float
4808000	4809000	Or fly
4809000	4810000	What colors are they?
4810000	4811000	They just like bird color
4811000	4813000	No blue and purple
4813000	4814000	Green
4814000	4815000	They just have
4815000	4817000	They're just characterized by like
4817000	4819000	They have slightly longer tail feathers than
4819000	4820000	But picture like a sparrow
4820000	4822000	But then take its tail feathers
4822000	4823000	And like make them like
4823000	4825000	The length of an extra sparrow
4825000	4826000	It's like a
4826000	4827000	Yeah
4827000	4828000	So it's just like
4828000	4829000	What is that?
4829000	4830000	Like a little baby road runner
4830000	4831000	Like not like a cartoon style
4831000	4832000	But like anyways
4832000	4834000	But they're all over my house
4834000	4836000	And they're very like
4836000	4838000	They're
4838000	4839000	God damn
4839000	4840000	They
4840000	4841000	They
4841000	4842000	So there's this neighborhood cat
4842000	4843000	And like
4843000	4846000	If the cat comes in my yard
4846000	4847000	I'm like
4847000	4848000	Oh, cute, cute, kitty
4848000	4849000	We got a little neighborhood cat
4849000	4853000	Maybe I'll give it a bowl of milk
4853000	4854000	One day
4854000	4855000	It's like UNICEF
4855000	4856000	Like
4856000	4857000	Oh, maybe if they catch me at the right time
4857000	4862000	I'll give them a Heathcliff fish bone
4862000	4864000	But no sooner than I'm thinking that
4864000	4866000	And these fucking things
4866000	4868000	Just dive bomb this cat
4868000	4869000	Good
4869000	4870000	And the birds are
4870000	4871000	Those birds are everywhere
4871000	4872000	All over my yard
4872000	4874000	They don't fuck with humans
4874000	4875000	They're constantly like
4875000	4876000	They'll fly low
4876000	4877000	They're not like
4877000	4878000	They don't
4878000	4879000	I've never felt threatened by them
4879000	4884000	I've been impressed by their
4884000	4885000	They're kind of like
4885000	4886000	I don't know what you'd call it
4886000	4889000	Like their airspace is very top gun
4889000	4890000	Like
4890000	4892000	Oh, hello, sailor
4892000	4894000	Like they're
4895000	4896000	You used to sail
4896000	4898000	Sailors don't fly planes
4898000	4899000	But
4899000	4901000	If they did
4901000	4904000	But Marines don't swim as much as the Navy
4904000	4905000	It's true
4905000	4907000	So fuck you for thinking
4907000	4909000	Hey look, there's room for confusion
4909000	4911000	Among the armed forces
4911000	4912000	There could be sailors that fly
4912000	4913000	You don't know
4915000	4916000	There are
4916000	4917000	There are
4917000	4918000	Bandships, they go up in planes
4918000	4919000	They're out in boats
4919000	4921000	You gotta be in the Navy to fly some of those planes
4921000	4922000	That's right
4922000	4923000	You're in the Air Force still
4923000	4924000	But you're also
4924000	4925000	A sailor
4925000	4926000	On the Navy
4926000	4927000	Thank you
4927000	4928000	And fuck everyone
4928000	4929000	Boat
4929000	4931000	Especially you, peacock man
4931000	4935000	How dare you think I had peacocks
4935000	4936000	Sorry
4936000	4937000	Den
4937000	4938000	Den
4938000	4939000	Den
4939000	4940000	Den
4940000	4941000	Yes, yes
4941000	4942000	Yes, British fan
4942000	4943000	Pickle
4943000	4944000	Pickle
4947000	4948000	Anyways
4948000	4949000	Pickle
4949000	4950000	I just find that remarkable
4950000	4951000	Because I was thinking what I'm like
4951000	4952000	These fucking things
4952000	4953000	Okay I know
4953000	4955000	This cat wasn't doing anything
4955000	4958000	It was definitely not like looking to rumble
4958000	4960000	It was like sunning itself
4960000	4961000	And these birds
4961000	4963000	One and then two
4963000	4964000	Started going
4964000	4965000	Shoo
4965000	4966000	And they were like
4966000	4967000	Fuck
4967000	4968000	The cat was like
4968000	4969000	Fuck you
4969000	4970000	It was not
4970000	4971000	It was like
4971000	4972000	Leave me alone
4972000	4973000	I'll move then
4973000	4974000	And then the birds were like
4974000	4975000	I said
4975000	4976000	Fuck you
4976000	4977000	And the cat was like
4977000	4978000	Fuck man
4978000	4979000	And I was like
4979000	4980000	Holy shit
4980000	4981000	I've never seen this
4981000	4983000	These birds are warring on this cat
4983000	4984000	Like honey come look at this
4984000	4985000	And it was like
4985000	4986000	Moving from window to window
4986000	4987000	It was like
4987000	4988000	Holy shit they won't leave this fucker alone
4988000	4989000	He's like
4989000	4990000	Running
4990000	4991000	He's like
4991000	4992000	At this point he is now definitely the victim
4992000	4993000	Like if he wasn't before
4993000	4994000	It was like
4994000	4995000	He's just like
4995000	4996000	I'm only born a cat
4996000	4998000	Like I've done nothing to any of you
4998000	4999000	And they were just like
4999000	5000000	Fuck you
5000000	5002000	Don't like the shape of your body
5002000	5003000	And
5003000	5006000	And I just thought that was crazy because
5006000	5007000	And I was thought about it
5007000	5008000	I was like
5008000	5009000	But they never fuck with me
5009000	5010000	I recognize that bird
5010000	5011000	They don't do that to me
5011000	5013000	I'm in the backyard in my pool
5013000	5014000	Or I'm running around
5014000	5015000	Like they've obviously
5015000	5016000	They've got some instinct
5016000	5017000	To protect their nest
5017000	5018000	Or their grounds
5018000	5020000	400 birds a year
5020000	5021000	One cat
5021000	5022000	They spread out
5022000	5025000	And they'll kill fucking four houses full
5025000	5026000	Like in that region
5026000	5027000	You mean the cats are that
5027000	5028000	Cats are the sharp
5028000	5029000	Cats are the sharp
5029000	5030000	Cats are the sharp
5030000	5031000	Cats are the sharp
5031000	5032000	Of the bloodosphere
5032000	5033000	Whereas humans are not
5033000	5034000	And in fact
5034000	5035000	To the contrary
5035000	5036000	They
5036000	5037000	It's like
5037000	5038000	This species of
5038000	5039000	No species of bird
5039000	5041000	That lives in a city
5041000	5044000	Would survive if their behavior included
5044000	5046000	Ever fucking with a guy mowing his lawn
5046000	5047000	Yeah
5047000	5048000	Because you would immediately go
5048000	5050000	That there's a vampire bird
5050000	5052000	Like open season
5052000	5053000	You hear them
5053000	5055000	Headpeckers are back again
5055000	5057000	They'd be extinct immediately
5057000	5058000	They are
5058000	5059000	They are
5059000	5060000	They don't live to tell the tale
5060000	5062000	There's no such thing as that species
5062000	5064000	I just found that kind of fascinating
5064000	5066000	That key and tumbler mechanism
5066000	5068000	But also did you know crows
5068000	5071000	Did you hear that episode of that G show?
5071000	5072000	Oh yeah
5072000	5073000	All about crows
5073000	5074000	You know about
5074000	5077000	They drop the nuts in the street
5077000	5078000	We've all heard that one
5078000	5079000	That old trope
5079000	5081000	They drop pennies on the train tracks
5081000	5083000	But they like recognize faces
5083000	5085000	They say about crows
5085000	5087000	They recognize human faces
5087000	5088000	Yeah, I bet they do
5088000	5089000	That's why don't be mean to crows
5089000	5095000	They're higher tech
5095000	5097000	It's not good enough for a crow
5097000	5099000	To just be either scared of humans
5099000	5103000	Or have an affinity toward them
5103000	5104000	I thought we were going to die
5104000	5105000	No, we're good
5105000	5107000	Earlier about 20 minutes ago
5107000	5108000	That's how we die
5108000	5109000	About 20 minutes ago
5109000	5110000	Through the crack in that curtain
5110000	5112000	I saw Steve Levy just standing there
5112000	5115000	Cracking his knuckles
5115000	5116000	That was like
5116000	5117000	A piano wire
5117000	5118000	Right
5118000	5119000	So it made me reach for my phone
5119000	5120000	I was like
5120000	5121000	That is gone
5121000	5122000	Come on back
5122000	5123000	It's like
5123000	5126000	A species of bird that we deem as ugly
5126000	5128000	And kind of like parasitic
5128000	5129000	Or what would you call it
5129000	5130000	Infestuous
5130000	5131000	Is that a word
5131000	5132000	Like we don't look at
5132000	5133000	I like it
5133000	5134000	We look at crows as being like
5134000	5138000	They don't deserve the avian title
5138000	5139000	They're like varmints
5139000	5140000	You know
5140000	5142000	But precisely because of that probably
5142000	5147000	They have developed like a keener relationship
5147000	5150000	With their human colleagues
5150000	5151000	Yeah
5151000	5152000	Because they're like
5152000	5153000	They want to be a crow
5153000	5158000	And look at all humans as one thing or another
5158000	5161000	It definitely you reproduce more as a crow
5161000	5163000	If you can tell the difference between
5163000	5167000	The little girl that brings you worms
5167000	5171000	And the cranky old man that has a BB gun
5171000	5174000	And it's like only the DNA passed
5174000	5175000	And it's like
5175000	5177000	So you have this like super intelligence
5177000	5179000	Among this like mangy bird
5179000	5180000	I fucking love crows
5180000	5181000	Yeah
5181000	5182000	That's the thing
5182000	5183000	People love crows
5183000	5185000	People feel like crows are super smart
5185000	5187000	Some people don't like the crows
5187000	5189000	But crows are like upper middle class
5189000	5191000	In the bird situation
5191000	5193000	So like they're sitting pretty
5193000	5195000	Because they can take on like a hawk
5195000	5197000	Like they will fuck a hawk up
5197000	5198000	A group of them
5198000	5200000	But they also kind of like will eat an egg
5200000	5202000	Out of a sparrow's nest
5202000	5203000	So like and sparrows can't really
5203000	5205000	No matter how many sparrows get together
5205000	5207000	They can't really take on a crow
5207000	5210000	So it's tense
5210000	5212000	And they have funerals apparently
5212000	5213000	Yeah
5213000	5214000	If a crow is dead
5214000	5216000	The other crows will gather around
5216000	5218000	And they'll observe the dead crow
5218000	5223000	But it's not just out of like some elephant-like nostalgia
5223000	5225000	They don't all be sad
5225000	5228000	Fucking idiot bleeding heart elephants
5228000	5230000	Oh an elephant died, I'm so sad
5230000	5232000	Let's have a wake
5232000	5234000	The crows are apparently like gathered
5234000	5237000	Around the dead crow for a little practical purpose
5237000	5238000	They're like appraising
5238000	5239000	What happened to this dead crow?
5239000	5241000	It's really more of an autopsy
5241000	5243000	It's an autopsy
5243000	5246000	Yeah, everyone that dies should have
5246000	5247000	In a proper society
5247000	5248000	An autopsy
5248000	5249000	Socialized autopsies
5249000	5250000	Yeah, no
5250000	5252000	I thought that was interesting
5252000	5253000	I don't know
5253000	5254000	Crows are just
5254000	5256000	I wish crows would be my friends
5256000	5257000	Does that make sense?
5257000	5258000	You could train a crow
5258000	5259000	If you got a baby crow
5259000	5260000	You know
5260000	5261000	You could take it up off the streets
5261000	5263000	Yeah, they actually are
5263000	5265000	I mean no one wants to be like a bird pet owner
5265000	5267000	But like crows are especially pretty
5267000	5269000	Bad to keep as pets apparently
5269000	5271000	I mean just they're messy
5271000	5272000	But they are smart
5272000	5273000	They'll be good
5273000	5275000	But anytime I see a crow
5275000	5277000	I wish I could just say to that crow
5277000	5279000	Hey man
5279000	5281000	You need some water or something?
5281000	5283000	I bought a frisbee
5283000	5285000	And a bottle of water to keep in my car
5285000	5287000	So if I see a hot crow
5287000	5289000	I could put out a bird bath of water
5289000	5291000	A hot crow?
5291000	5292000	Yeah, you know
5292000	5294000	You mean like a sexy crow
5295000	5297000	Wearing like fishnets
5297000	5298000	No but
5298000	5299000	Give me a beat
5299000	5300000	Hey girl
5300000	5301000	Hey girl
5301000	5302000	I'll take a beat
5302000	5303000	You working?
5303000	5305000	But when it gets hot
5305000	5307000	You know they kind of open their mouth
5307000	5309000	And they look like they're panting or whatever
5309000	5310000	And it seems really uncomfortable
5310000	5311000	And it's like man that sucks
5311000	5312000	I also went to the store
5312000	5315000	To try and buy crow feed
5315000	5317000	But crows don't really eat feed
5317000	5319000	So I don't know
5319000	5321000	I guess I'm gonna get stale french fries
5321000	5323000	Crows love stale french fries
5323000	5324000	If you didn't know that
5324000	5325000	They'll eat fucking anything
5325000	5326000	You get dead squirrel
5326000	5327000	Right
5327000	5328000	They're awesome
5328000	5329000	They do kind of like
5329000	5330000	I mean
5330000	5331000	That's why they don't eat feed
5331000	5332000	If you live in the city
5332000	5334000	And you got crows in your backyard
5334000	5336000	They can be super fucking annoying
5336000	5337000	Oh they're loud
5337000	5338000	They're, they're
5338000	5340000	That is not a pretty
5340000	5344000	They're the German of bird language
5346000	5352000	That is not a call designed to seduce anyone
5352000	5354000	This seduces me
5354000	5356000	Are you telling me that
5356000	5357000	It's defined
5357000	5359000	And they do the thing that coyotes do
5359000	5361000	Which is one crow will make a bunch of noise
5361000	5362000	To make other crows
5362000	5365000	That it doesn't even know to fuck your shit up
5365000	5366000	But just to do this again
5366000	5368000	They do say their call is a little more intricate
5368000	5370000	And that's probably why it sounds a little uglier to us
5370000	5372000	Because it's more function over form
5372000	5373000	Like German
5373000	5376000	Strumpfenhosenbrügenvergen
5376000	5378000	Strumpfel
5378000	5379000	I just said pantyhosen German
5379000	5381000	That's the only word I know
5382000	5384000	It's a big internet
5384000	5387000	I can say pantyhosen a lot of different languages
5387000	5390000	That's what you learned at the magician's house
5392000	5395000	But also that they, they mimic other birds
5395000	5397000	Like they're just not famous for it
5397000	5399000	The way parrots are
5399000	5402000	That they can, they can choose to sound like other birds
5402000	5403000	They just
5403000	5404000	No one pays them for it
5404000	5405000	They just, yeah, exactly
5405000	5407000	They're like, yeah, those shit gig
5407000	5409000	I'm not gonna, I'm not your fucking
5409000	5410000	Rich little
5410000	5411000	God damn it
5411000	5412000	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
5412000	5414000	Branson, Missouri bird
5414000	5416000	I'm not gonna fucking like play a fiddle for you
5416000	5418000	And fucking wear rhinestones
5418000	5421000	I'm fucking, I'm on the streets, bitch
5423000	5424000	Peacock
5426000	5427000	Now peacocks are bad
5427000	5428000	And they say I moved this place
5428000	5429000	Because these birds are locked in
5429000	5430000	Peacock
5430000	5431000	Sorry, what sir?
5431000	5432000	I'm sorry
5432000	5433000	Peacock
5437000	5438000	I love that guy
5438000	5439000	Yeah, yeah
5440000	5442000	I love just enough booze guy is that guy
5442000	5444000	Don't peacock sound like cats
5444000	5445000	Though peacocks go like
5445000	5446000	Meow
5446000	5447000	Yeah kind of
5447000	5448000	Meow
5448000	5449000	It's a really bad sound
5449000	5450000	Yeah
5450000	5451000	It's awful
5451000	5452000	Meow
5452000	5453000	Meow
5455000	5457000	Brandon's recoiling
5457000	5460000	Can you imagine if that cat was fucking being chased
5460000	5462000	By two things making the same noise
5462000	5463000	It makes
5463000	5464000	By your peacocks
5464000	5465000	Meow
5466000	5467000	Meow
5468000	5470000	What if two peacocks were chasing a cat
5470000	5472000	And two of those long-tailed birds
5472000	5473000	That aren't peacocks
5473000	5474000	Were like in the neighborhoods
5474000	5475000	They're like
5475000	5476000	Yeah, I don't know
5476000	5478000	I don't know what they sound like
5478000	5479000	On fox
5481000	5484000	Did you know that whales, Brandon
5487000	5490000	That they might be able to communicate their feelings
5490000	5491000	With their echolocation
5491000	5495000	That human observers detect pods of whales
5495000	5496000	With a couple of sick whales in it
5496000	5501000	And we suspect it's possible that the whale song
5501000	5502000	In a pod of whales
5502000	5506000	That their song so affects each other
5506000	5508000	That if there's a couple of sick whales in a pod
5508000	5511000	That their whole song becomes We Are Sick
5512000	5515000	So they sort of tease the sick whale
5516000	5518000	We are sick
5518000	5522000	We are sick
5526000	5528000	And they really feel it too
5528000	5529000	They feel it
5529000	5530000	So you're saying
5530000	5532000	They're just trying to get rid of the sick whales
5532000	5534000	I'm sick too
5534000	5537000	Look at me, I'm sick
5537000	5539000	I'm just going to go beach myself
5539000	5542000	Oh, I'm going to beach myself too
5542000	5544000	See you later, Glenn
5547000	5550000	That would be an equally valid explanation of that phenomenon
5550000	5551000	We just wouldn't know
5551000	5553000	We wouldn't assume that they were like us
5553000	5554000	Yeah
5554000	5557000	We listened to, me and Dan listened to this podcast on Radiolab
5557000	5560000	It was a contest about animal intelligences
5560000	5563000	And the slime mold one, which is bullshit
5563000	5564000	What?
5564000	5565000	They're not smart
5565000	5566000	They're just efficient
5566000	5568000	Like a robot's not smart
5568000	5569000	That's how they judge it
5569000	5570000	Well, it's kind of dumb
5570000	5573000	It's like, yeah, like what's your, I mean, that's the question they asked in the beginning
5573000	5575000	Like, how would you measure animal intelligence?
5575000	5576000	Yeah
5576000	5580000	Would you measure it if a dog, like Robert Krollwich said
5580000	5585000	He used the example of like a snow fox being able to detect a mouse and dive down
5585000	5587000	Which to me is not intelligence
5587000	5590000	It's like, yeah, well, we define intelligence by like
5590000	5593000	Yeah, but that kind of raises that question
5593000	5595000	It's like, well, what are we doing that's so goddamn smart?
5595000	5597000	Math, cities
5597000	5598000	There you go
5598000	5599000	Yeah, but we're
5599000	5600000	Two answers right off the bat
5600000	5603000	But aren't we doing those things by instinct
5603000	5605000	And also which one of us can do those things?
5605000	5606000	Like we're not
5606000	5607000	I can do math
5607000	5608000	We just do those things
5608000	5609000	I can do cities
5610000	5619000	I love that we said it like two rejects during the apocalypse
5619000	5620000	Yeah
5620000	5622000	Well, I can do math
5622000	5625000	So don't kill me and my boy here
5625000	5626000	He's cities
5626000	5627000	He does cities
5627000	5630000	We should get extra crackers
5630000	5632000	We should get access to water
5632000	5634000	Because my boy here do cities
5634000	5637000	You guys are like of mice and men, you're like traveling
5637000	5640000	This building should be 11 buildings high
5640000	5645000	Which means seven buildings high plus two buildings high
5645000	5647000	And then no one can question you because you're like
5647000	5650000	I invented math
5650000	5651000	No one else has math
5651000	5652000	Everyone's like
5654000	5658000	Sounds like that's what 11 is
5658000	5660000	So I'm not very good at it, but we're still rich
5660000	5664000	I guess he's the Gary Sinise
5664000	5665000	That episode was weird
5666000	5667000	It was a live event
5667000	5670000	And so people were leaning really hard into trying to perform
5670000	5671000	And not like pleading their case
5671000	5674000	But I found it pretty unsatisfying as a result
5674000	5677000	I thought it was an interesting blend of that
5677000	5679000	And some information
5679000	5680000	I don't know
5680000	5684000	You judge an animal's intelligence by its ability to unscrew a lid
5684000	5685000	Yeah, see exactly
5685000	5686000	That's what I mean
5686000	5689000	It's like an octopus can fucking get the thing and then put it over itself
5689000	5690000	Like that's smart
5690000	5693000	Like the whale lady was like
5693000	5696000	Oh it might be the case that whales feel feelings
5696000	5699000	Because when they echolocate to communicate with each other
5699000	5701000	It actually hits them in the face
5701000	5704000	And so it's a physical sensation that they're feeling
5704000	5707000	And so it's like if you're actually punched in the face by sadness
5707000	5709000	Rather than just receiving sadness
5709000	5713000	And I'm like that's not putting yourself into a cup
5713000	5714000	You know
5714000	5717000	That's not learning to read a book like an octopus does
5717000	5720000	I mean a motherfucking chicken can beat you a tic-tac-toe
5720000	5721000	They talked about that
5721000	5722000	They talked about that
5722000	5723000	Holy shit
5723000	5724000	Do not
5724000	5725000	Don't
5725000	5726000	It's not true
5726000	5727000	Don't
5727000	5728000	Sorry
5728000	5729000	Don't
5729000	5730000	Don't
5730000	5731000	This is my dad's stuff
5731000	5734000	Chickens are actually the dumbest animal in the world
5734000	5735000	What?
5735000	5737000	That chicken beat me
5737000	5739000	It beat me dead
5739000	5741000	I mean that guy was kind of funny, right?
5741000	5744000	Because he brought the chickens out and he was kind of subverting the whole thing
5744000	5747000	Well, yeah, see, to me it's like
5747000	5751000	They say, oh, we're going to do a contest about animal intelligence
5751000	5755000	And here's four people that are going to do three minutes of weird stand-up
5755000	5757000	Like it's like, well, let's talk about
5757000	5758000	We could do
5758000	5759000	There's probably room for both
5759000	5760000	But I don't know
5760000	5761000	Anyway
5761000	5763000	I think I'm just 46 and I'm like now I'm like
5763000	5765000	I like NPR
5765000	5767000	And you're like, God damn it
5767000	5768000	The world's on fire
5768000	5769000	And I'm like
5769000	5770000	It really is
5770000	5771000	Calm down, Sonny
5771000	5772000	Isn't it?
5772000	5773000	It's fucking on fire
5773000	5776000	Just listen to the big band music on the NPR
5776000	5779000	They've got Tommy Dorsey blowing bubbles
5781000	5785000	They don't want to say Nazi too many times in an hour
5785000	5788000	They would upset the old bones
5788000	5791000	Yeah, I think I just specifically have a vendetta
5791000	5793000	Against like that Radiolab style of humor
5793000	5794000	I don't know
5794000	5796000	Something about it really greats me
5796000	5799000	Did you ever hear the Radiolab where they fucking
5799000	5802000	Like, where Krollwich accidentally fucking
5802000	5805000	Catastrophically triggered like this like
5805000	5807000	Indigenous dude who was like
5807000	5808000	Oh, that pissed me off
5808000	5810000	But I was like, yeah
5810000	5811000	Okay, so there was a
5811000	5812000	Let's talk about it
5812000	5815000	There was a guy who was talking about how in his village
5815000	5816000	Or city or whatever
5816000	5817000	There was this
5817000	5820000	A phenomenon that he almost
5820000	5823000	Invested with supernatural
5823000	5824000	Weight to it
5824000	5825000	Because it's like this
5825000	5828000	Was it like yellow detritus
5828000	5830000	Or yellow dust kind of came down or something
5830000	5832000	Some color of dust descended
5832000	5834000	And there they like thought it was like
5834000	5836000	It was like a myth or like
5836000	5838000	It was like a secret alien
5838000	5839000	Not alien but
5839000	5841000	They're like, oh, it's like the government
5841000	5843000	Or it's like aliens or ghosts or something
5843000	5845000	And then he's like, you know, that was like
5845000	5847000	America doing weird experiments
5847000	5849000	And he got like really mad, right?
5849000	5850000	Was that you're talking about?
5850000	5853000	Yeah, but are you sure that specifically was the paradigm?
5853000	5855000	Because I thought I remembered it as like
5855000	5858000	They were convinced it was government experiments
5858000	5859000	Right, that's what it was
5859000	5861000	The truth is it was like fungus or something
5861000	5863000	Yeah, and so then they got really offended at the idea
5863000	5866000	And then they were like, yeah, well, we've struggled so hard
5866000	5867000	And it's been so hard
5867000	5868000	And you just don't understand that
5868000	5870000	But it's like, no, you don't understand
5870000	5871000	You just the government sucks
5871000	5873000	And also this was just moss
5873000	5874000	Like I'm sorry
5874000	5875000	The government still sucks
5875000	5876000	I'm not saying they're great
5876000	5878000	Yeah, no, it was just crazy
5878000	5879000	It was crazy to listen to
5879000	5881000	It was basically what he was saying was
5881000	5883000	Our people have suffered from this
5883000	5885000	Incredible dust that the United States put on us
5885000	5887000	And these guys were like debunkers who were like
5887000	5888000	Hey, that was just pollen
5888000	5889000	Yes, something like that
5889000	5890000	Yeah, it was sort of like
5890000	5891000	This is just sexually just fungus
5891000	5892000	You don't know
5892000	5893000	We've been through a conversation
5893000	5895000	Your people have been the victim of like
5895000	5897000	Exploitation or whatever development or whatever
5897000	5901000	But this yellow shit that comes down is actually just a natural thing
5901000	5905000	And the it was like it was act it was it was
5905000	5907000	It was magnified by the fact that it was like a young woman
5907000	5910000	That was translating for like this elder
5910000	5912000	Was like just speaking in his native language
5912000	5913000	And she was translating for him
5913000	5915000	And it was just it was crazy to hear
5915000	5916000	It was intense
5916000	5917000	Like it was really I mean
5917000	5918000	It was one of those things was like
5918000	5922000	I was really glad I heard it because it was so like
5922000	5924000	It was like part train wreck
5924000	5926000	But there was something healthy about it
5926000	5927000	I don't know
5927000	5930000	It was like because it was it was NPR guys that were just like
5930000	5933000	Oh, by the way, we do a science show on NPR
5933000	5935000	And this is just shit falling down
5935000	5936000	And then the guys like
5936000	5940000	I don't want to do an impression of fucking indigenous language
5940000	5941000	No, no do it
5941000	5942000	But if you did
5942000	5943000	No, no
5943000	5944000	Go a little something
5944000	5945000	I don't know
5945000	5946000	He's speaking indigenous language
5946000	5947000	And she's translating
5947000	5951000	And it's like but you can hear his timber changing
5951000	5953000	And then she's translating
5953000	5954000	And she's going like
5955000	5956000	But you don't understand
5956000	5957000	The thing is is this
5957000	5959000	And then Crow which is like
5959000	5963000	Yeah, but it was just like the fungus
5963000	5964000	And then he's just like
5966000	5968000	Excitation level starts going up
5968000	5969000	So you can't understand what he's saying
5969000	5972000	But she's matching his level
5972000	5973000	And she's translating for him in real time
5973000	5976000	And she's in tears
5976000	5977000	Yeah
5977000	5978000	She starts going like
5978000	5980000	But but you don't understand
5980000	5983000	Like like like how can you do this to us
5983000	5987000	How can you after everything you've done
5987000	5989000	And then you bring us in here
5989000	5991000	And the whole time you hear him underneath
5991000	5992000	Saying things you don't understand
5992000	5994000	And but it's mounting and mounting
5994000	5996000	And he's he he's the baseline
5996000	5997000	And she's the treble
5997000	5999000	And they're both going up and up and up
5999000	6003000	And Robert Crow which doesn't strike me as a guy
6003000	6005000	Who's ever been in the business of confrontation
6005000	6006000	And so he's just like
6006000	6007000	Whoops
6010000	6011000	And then Jad Abenrad's like
6011000	6014000	Well maybe there's a way to huh
6014000	6016000	It was it was fucking crazy
6016000	6019000	But it was like deep respect that they aired it
6019000	6021000	That they fucking that they that they family go like
6021000	6024000	Here's a crazy fucking thing we got into
6024000	6025000	Yeah
6025000	6028000	Which is like we didn't mean to offend
6028000	6030000	But it was like no heroes no villains
6030000	6034000	Just like a crazy four-way intersection of culture humanity
6034000	6036000	Like like like I don't know
6036000	6039000	It was it was it was I mean one thing's for sure
6039000	6041000	You get hypnotized driving to work
6041000	6042000	You're listening to Radiolab
6042000	6044000	And then all of a sudden some shit like that goes down
6044000	6047000	And you're like whoa goddamn do I need to pull my car over?
6047000	6049000	Should I call in late to work?
6049000	6051000	Like do I need to drive over to NPR?
6051000	6053000	Do they need help?
6053000	6055000	They need help
6056000	6058000	It was a driveway moment
6058000	6059000	And I do respect that
6059000	6061000	Because I like I did Whiting Wongs with Jessica
6061000	6062000	And like you know we would do
6062000	6064000	There was more than a couple times when it was like
6064000	6066000	Shit would hit the fan
6066000	6068000	And like I would sound like a fucking pompous ass
6068000	6071000	And like I you know we'd step out of the booth
6071000	6072000	And go like that was visceral
6072000	6075000	And then you go like the engineer would be like
6075000	6076000	You want me to edit anything out?
6076000	6079000	I'd be like no because you can't like don't
6079000	6080000	Yeah
6080000	6083000	Like like like like like let's what are we doing this for then?
6083000	6084000	That would be fucking dumb
6084000	6087000	Like like like like okay so I threw a tantrum
6087000	6090000	And like like air it you know like gotta do it
6090000	6092000	Gotta do it put it in the shadow box
6092000	6094000	Otherwise otherwise you can't pay yourself
6094000	6096000	To like fucking talking to a microphone
6097000	6099000	Yeah, I do respect it that they're like
6099000	6101000	They got caught in that fucking sand trap
6101000	6103000	And they were like oof this is uncomfortable
6103000	6104000	This isn't
6104000	6107000	It's also faster if you double down in a way
6107000	6110000	That's like oh man I was also shocked by the things
6110000	6111000	That came out of my mouth
6111000	6114000	Versus this like what we do is we kind of run
6114000	6117000	And I think now if you can get there faster
6117000	6120000	Than your critics and go shit
6120000	6123000	I was trying I said some shit
6123000	6124000	I fucked up
6125000	6126000	And you would have too
6126000	6128000	If you'd been talking for 48 minutes straight
6128000	6131000	Because we all would like I think after
6131000	6134000	We all got about 15 minutes with a charm in us
6135000	6136000	Which means
6136000	6138000	In like 30 minutes you start being like
6138000	6141000	Yeah, my dad was just you know he just drank too much
6141000	6142000	I don't know anyway
6142000	6144000	I'm glad we're here let's cut the cake
6147000	6150000	But it just bring me back to that thing that I talked with Duncan
6150000	6153000	Babbling endlessly about but it was like it had to do with that free will thing
6153000	6156000	Because it's like it is weird how our culture
6156000	6159000	And by our culture I genuinely mean like
6159000	6163000	I think basically the entire human species culture
6163000	6165000	Like we seem to have it in for ourselves
6165000	6171000	In that we do not want to reward the changing of the mind
6171000	6173000	We have an inherent suspicion
6173000	6175000	And probably for a pretty good reason
6175000	6177000	Because there's this thing called sociopaths
6177000	6179000	That like if there's absolutely
6179000	6181000	If you hold nothing sacred
6181000	6184000	And you can just feel however express
6184000	6186000	Whatever you need to express to get through
6186000	6188000	Whatever gates you need to get through
6188000	6190000	You're a genuine danger to the rest of society
6190000	6192000	We are held in place by the fact that
6192000	6195000	Hey, I choose not to be a criminal today
6195000	6197000	It's not because there's a cop watching me every second
6197000	6201000	It's like I might not encounter a cop the entire day
6201000	6202000	And still obey the law
6202000	6206000	Why? Because I have decided that I am a law abiding citizen
6206000	6208000	How do you do that?
6209000	6212000	Oh Brandon
6215000	6218000	Now a man don't move to the
6219000	6224000	But it is weird how much we punish
6226000	6228000	The changing of the mind
6228000	6231000	That we're like oh I don't trust you now
6231000	6234000	Because you said you felt a different way yesterday
6234000	6235000	Yeah
6235000	6237000	And the weird thing about that is
6237000	6239000	That we are
6239000	6243000	All you have outside of the changing
6243000	6245000	The changing is the only thing
6245000	6247000	Whether we say free will is an illusion or not
6247000	6250000	It's still arguably
6250000	6253000	That's all there is to who you really are
6253000	6255000	Everything else is shit outside your control
6255000	6258000	Even within a model where you have no control over your choices
6258000	6260000	This real stat over here is still
6260000	6263000	Arguably the only thing worth paying attention to
6263000	6266000	That this moved today to yesterday
6266000	6269000	Like all this other shit is like well this guy woke up on Monday
6269000	6271000	And he said I'm proud to be white
6271000	6273000	And he spent 70 years saying that
6273000	6275000	It's like well that's obviously worth nothing
6275000	6277000	Because it never changed
6277000	6280000	And so like we punish the change
6280000	6283000	We kind of like we regard it
6283000	6285000	We want it to happen a little bit
6285000	6287000	But we don't want to go
6287000	6289000	David Bowie did it enough
6289000	6291000	But don't do it too much
6291000	6293000	Because you don't want to be a Kardashian
6293000	6295000	Don't be empty
6295000	6297000	Don't reveal yourself to be virtue signaling
6297000	6299000	Which means that you only
6299000	6301000	You just do whatever you go where the wind blows
6301000	6303000	We just have all these opinions
6303000	6306000	About when you're allowed to change your mind
6306000	6309000	And what basis you're using
6309000	6311000	To change how you think
6311000	6313000	And yet that's all you possibly could be
6313000	6315000	And throughout your life is like how you change
6315000	6319000	I want my money back
6321000	6323000	From being a human
6323000	6325000	I wish I could be a raccoon
6325000	6327000	They got a maid
6327000	6329000	There's no raccoons out there rumbling each other
6329000	6331000	Like hey man
6331000	6333000	You ate a different kind of garbage yesterday
6333000	6336000	But they do sniff each other's butt for that reason
6336000	6340000	So there is some evolutionary shit to change
6340000	6342000	You told me all about the butt sniffing
6342000	6343000	With the dogs
6343000	6344000	I know
6344000	6346000	He's got a whole thing about the butt sniffing
6346000	6348000	Go off king
6349000	6351000	Go, go, go
6351000	6353000	Is that a thing or did you?
6353000	6354000	Oh I invented that
6354000	6355000	I'm a genius
6355000	6356000	Go off king
6356000	6357000	No no that's a thing
6357000	6359000	That's the counter to yes queen
6359000	6361000	That's the salt to yes queen's pepper
6361000	6362000	Fucking
6362000	6363000	I want to hear about this
6363000	6364000	Go off king
6364000	6365000	Spill the teen uncle
6365000	6367000	Or the dog butts
6368000	6371000	Spill the power aid
6373000	6374000	No what's this about dogs?
6374000	6376000	Spill that gospel priest
6378000	6380000	That they use it to figure out what the other dog has been eating
6380000	6381000	Where it's been going
6381000	6383000	What it's been fucking around with
6383000	6385000	That they sort of use it like a
6385000	6387000	Like it's a cheap GPS
6387000	6388000	Because your butthole
6388000	6391000	Your butthole holds all the information about where you've been
6391000	6392000	The poop
6392000	6393000	The poop
6393000	6394000	It's their wallet
6394000	6395000	It's their
6395000	6396000	It's the shoes they're wearing
6396000	6397000	It's like a dog
6397000	6401000	A dog from uptown is going to have a totally different asshole smell
6401000	6403000	Than a dog from downtown
6403000	6404000	And the dog from uptown is like
6404000	6406000	God damn you got a high protein diet
6406000	6407000	Right
6407000	6409000	And like wolves are like
6409000	6411000	Oh shit there's a lot of protein in your asshole
6411000	6413000	You're not eating a bunch of grass
6413000	6414000	You're not a sick wolf
6414000	6415000	You've been
6415000	6417000	You're downing a lot of mammoth or pigs
6417000	6418000	Right
6418000	6420000	I'm going to roll with you
6420000	6422000	Because you've got protein to
6422000	6424000	Like people who hunt with you
6424000	6426000	End up with protein
6426000	6427000	Yeah
6427000	6428000	Yeah
6428000	6429000	That's a fucked up
6429000	6430000	And you thought that was a little disappointing
6430000	6432000	Because you're like
6432000	6433000	They're capitalists
6433000	6434000	You know
6434000	6435000	That they're
6435000	6436000	That they're not
6436000	6437000	That they're
6437000	6439000	But I thought it was a little actually uplifting
6439000	6441000	I want to go back to the choice thing though
6441000	6442000	Because it's super interesting
6442000	6444000	Is that you can buy certain cars
6444000	6446000	You can buy eight colors
6446000	6449000	But on high end cars you can get 40 colors
6449000	6450000	Right
6450000	6451000	So I think
6451000	6455000	I think choice is a huge thing that gets used against us
6455000	6459000	And that the execution of choice is offensive to people
6459000	6460000	That they're like
6460000	6463000	Who do you think you are to make that choice
6463000	6465000	It's really what we're all fighting to do
6465000	6468000	Is get to a position where we can choose every hour of the day
6468000	6470000	But there's a big scam going on, right
6470000	6473000	Like the man is laughing all the way to the bank
6473000	6474000	Yeah
6474000	6476000	If poor people and like
6476000	6479000	The less we change our minds
6479000	6481000	Well they like to keep you in a box so you can't
6481000	6482000	Right
6482000	6484000	Because who wants a bunch of poor people
6484000	6486000	Like waking up every day and checking
6486000	6487000	Take an inventory and going like
6487000	6488000	How do I feel?
6488000	6489000	I don't know
6489000	6490000	I'm going to make a new decision today
6490000	6491000	Is it Taco Tuesday?
6491000	6492000	No, fuck you
6492000	6493000	It's not even Tuesday
6493000	6495000	Oh shit I woo
6495000	6496000	Yeah
6496000	6497000	And so there's a
6497000	6501000	And I don't mean like America, Area 51, Washington
6501000	6502000	I like
6502000	6503000	In general
6503000	6504000	Society
6504000	6506000	And by the way we live in one
6506000	6507000	What?
6507000	6509000	We live in a society
6509000	6511000	Like that is the scam
6511000	6512000	Yeah
6512000	6513000	That's the big con
6513000	6514000	Is like
6514000	6518000	Don't fucking tell me you feel differently today
6518000	6520000	Don't come at me talking about like
6520000	6522000	You felt one way today
6522000	6523000	And you felt
6523000	6524000	That's women talk
6524000	6526000	Like we feminize that
6526000	6528000	We say oh women are intuitive
6528000	6529000	They were mercurial
6529000	6530000	Like we
6530000	6531000	And we tell them at the same time
6531000	6532000	You're weak
6532000	6533000	That's why you can't
6533000	6535000	Be in charge of shit
6535000	6537000	Because you'll change your mind too much
6537000	6539000	When women go shopping it takes forever
6539000	6541000	When a man goes into a store
6541000	6543000	You just pull something off the shelf
6543000	6544000	I'm on to the game
6544000	6545000	That's how we shame you
6545000	6546000	The man
6546000	6547000	If the man is listening
6547000	6548000	I'm on to your shit
6548000	6550000	I'm going to change my mind every fucking day
6550000	6552000	I'm going to be the fucking kiss of minds
6552000	6553000	Yeah
6553000	6556000	Well they kind of stuck to the same thing basically
6556000	6559000	I'm going to be the David Bowie of minds
6559000	6561000	But like faster though
6561000	6563000	I'm not going to like take seven years
6563000	6565000	And then be like look at now I'm into suits
6565000	6566000	I'm going to
6566000	6570000	I'm going to be the RuPaul of minds
6570000	6571000	You're going to be the
6571000	6572000	Remember you're going to be the
6572000	6573000	Christie Brinkley Billy Joel
6573000	6574000	I'm going to be the
6574000	6576000	Christie Brinkley of minds
6576000	6579000	Not the early Irish angry Jewish
6580000	6583000	I'm going to be like a fast forward Billy Joel
6583000	6584000	Where I'm like
6584000	6585000	Surprise I'm not
6585000	6586000	I'm not like
6586000	6590000	I'm not going to hit you for talking last night at the party
6590000	6593000	Now I love you and I'm keeping the faith
6593000	6594000	But like
6594000	6596000	I'm not going to take four years to get there
6596000	6597000	I'm going to be like
6598000	6599000	I'm going to punch you
6599000	6600000	I love you
6600000	6601000	I'm a drone
6604000	6606000	You were talking about that last night
6606000	6607000	Billy Joel
6607000	6609000	He bedded Christie Brinkley
6609000	6610000	And then he became
6610000	6611000	He was like
6611000	6612000	He started off like
6612000	6614000	I'm an angry man
6614000	6616000	I'm an Irish man Jewish
6616000	6618000	But Irish singing man
6618000	6619000	And then he got a little
6619000	6620000	Last night at the party
6620000	6622000	You started lipping off
6622000	6625000	You had to be a fucking bitch, didn't you?
6625000	6627000	Oh, but you didn't know this morning
6627000	6628000	I pay the rent
6631000	6632000	And then it was like
6632000	6633000	Uptown girl
6634000	6636000	She's got pussy that I've never had
6637000	6641000	I think I'm going to give her pussy a whirl
6641000	6646000	I'm afraid to look around at the world
6646000	6648000	And then every album
6648000	6649000	And I was like
6649000	6652000	Cooling in my pockets and a heap of the Pepsi
6652000	6654000	Doop-a-doop-a-doop
6654000	6657000	Cause the good days weren't always good
6657000	6660000	And tomorrow's not as bad as it seems
6660000	6663000	That's fucking liberal talk
6663000	6665000	He was all the way mega
6665000	6667000	Like what happened to the fuckers
6667000	6668000	To the bakers
6668000	6670000	Are you fucking Chinese?
6670000	6672000	Right, right
6672000	6674000	I got a problem with you
6674000	6676000	And I don't mind playing the piano with my foot
6676000	6678000	I'm racist
6679000	6680000	I'm putting grease in my hair
6680000	6682000	And if you got a problem
6682000	6684000	You can take it up with my dickball
6687000	6688000	Cut to
6688000	6690000	Do I do that?
6690000	6692000	Oh, I want some grease in my hair
6692000	6693000	Or maybe I don't
6693000	6695000	I love weedies
6696000	6697000	And then at all cold nights
6697000	6698000	And we didn't start the fire
6698000	6699000	He's just like
6699000	6702000	No burning bras and a lid of mine
6702000	6704000	Everybody remembers all the burger wars
6704000	6705000	And Pepsi Coke
6705000	6707000	And he's just hanging out talking about
6707000	6709000	He's like Gandalf now
6709000	6710000	She's great, so great
6710000	6711000	Everything so great
6711000	6713000	Got that pussy so great
6713000	6715000	Pricky, prickly, so great
6715000	6716000	Ex-wife, first wife
6716000	6718000	Look at Chrissy, prickly now
6718000	6720000	She's my wife, wife, wife
6720000	6722000	I didn't get divorced
6722000	6724000	But I'm Mary Chrissy, prickly
6724000	6726000	So you can all blow me
6729000	6731000	By the time she left me
6731000	6733000	My dick didn't work anymore
6733000	6734000	I still win
6736000	6738000	I'm gonna be on American Idol
6738000	6740000	Cause I wrote 900 songs
6742000	6744000	Well, we didn't, we can't top that
6744000	6745000	But we blew it
6745000	6746000	We could've ended on a high
6746000	6748000	So, I, I mean
6748000	6750000	Have you seen these videos of Billy Joel
6750000	6751000	Just like losing it
6751000	6752000	And like throwing shit
6752000	6753000	And kicking stuff
6753000	6755000	Was that in his earlier days?
6755000	6756000	Like just a burger king or
6756000	6757000	No, no, on stage
6757000	6758000	Like he has these, he's had these
6758000	6759000	On stage tantrums
6759000	6760000	Where he like
6760000	6761000	So you've seen him
6761000	6762000	Does he, I think he like
6762000	6764000	Puts his foot through someone's drum
6764000	6765000	And
6765000	6766000	Yeah, he got really mad at like
6766000	6767000	A sound check
6767000	6768000	And was like, fuck this
6768000	6769000	But he was on stage
6769000	6771000	Well, but if somebody brings a drum
6771000	6772000	To a concert
6772000	6773000	No, it was his band
6773000	6774000	Oh, his band, okay
6774000	6775000	And I think
6776000	6777000	I would be like
6777000	6778000	If somebody had a microphone here
6778000	6779000	I'd be like, give me that
6779000	6780000	Stop that
6780000	6781000	Peacock, peacock
6782000	6783000	Come here, stop that
6783000	6784000	That would be so crazy
6784000	6785000	I love you, but you, you, you
6785000	6787000	You can't be that amplified
6787000	6789000	I want to see someone bring it like
6789000	6790000	Just bring a drum
6790000	6791000	Into a concert
6791000	6793000	Boom, boom, boom
6793000	6794000	First drum
6794000	6796000	I got a pocket full of
6796000	6797000	Boom, boom, boom, boom
6797000	6798000	Crap tonight
6798000	6800000	Boom, boom, boom, boom
6801000	6802000	Spin doctors are like
6804000	6806000	Chicago, we're famous for our
6806000	6807000	Comradery, but
6807000	6808000	Buddy
6809000	6810000	Come on
6810000	6811000	Would you
6811000	6813000	Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop
6813000	6814000	Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop
6814000	6816000	You just got the major hat
6816000	6817000	I also know this song
6818000	6819000	It says spin doctors on it
6819000	6820000	You're kind of like
6821000	6822000	Boop, boop, boop
6822000	6823000	Next time I go to a concert
6823000	6824000	I'm going to get the first row
6824000	6825000	And bring a harmonica
6829000	6830000	I don't give a fuck
6830000	6831000	Who's on stage?
6831000	6832000	Like, oh look
6832000	6833000	It's Tyrese Gibson
6833000	6835000	From the Fast and the Furious movies
6836000	6838000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
6842000	6843000	So we all have
6843000	6844000	YouTube
6845000	6846000	YouTube Billy Joel
6847000	6848000	Oh yeah, please do
6848000	6849000	I wish we could just
6849000	6850000	put it up on the screen
6850000	6851000	He throws his piano
6851000	6853000	Doesn't he throw his keyboard?
6853000	6854000	I just, I can't think of
6854000	6856000	what the actual move is
6856000	6857000	But to me it was like just
6857000	6859000	just incredibly violent
6859000	6860000	Like you didn't hit someone
6860000	6862000	But like everything he was doing
6862000	6864000	to me just smacked of violence
6864000	6865000	And I was like wow
6867000	6868000	Yeah
6868000	6869000	It punched of violence
6874000	6875000	Let there be no mistaking
6875000	6876000	where we're going
6877000	6878000	Yeah, it was wild
6878000	6879000	Smack to violence
6880000	6882000	The one thing that sticks in my head
6882000	6884000	about Billy Joel is that supposedly
6884000	6885000	maybe it's apocryphal
6885000	6886000	I don't know but supposedly
6886000	6888000	he's the one guy that never gave
6889000	6892000	Weird Al permission to parody him
6892000	6893000	Or like
6894000	6895000	He didn't like that tracks
6895000	6896000	Like Weird Al did that sign
6896000	6898000	It's all Billy Joel to me
6898000	6900000	And Billy Joel was like
6900000	6902000	historically was like
6902000	6903000	Thumbs down
6903000	6904000	I don't like it
6905000	6906000	Whereas Madonna's like
6906000	6907000	Yeah, like a surgeon
6907000	6908000	I mean
6909000	6910000	I think like a virgin's
6910000	6911000	a little edgier but
6912000	6913000	I'm not sure what you're
6913000	6914000	parodying at this point
6914000	6915000	You're kind of
6916000	6918000	taking the edge off of my work
6918000	6920000	It seems non satirical
6920000	6921000	Like a surgeon
6922000	6924000	So Billy Joel, come on man
6924000	6925000	You're ripe for it
6926000	6927000	You're ripe for ridicule
6928000	6929000	But he didn't want it
6929000	6930000	I don't cottin' to that
6931000	6932000	Don't weirdify me
6933000	6934000	I'm not weird
6935000	6936000	So you're weird
6937000	6939000	Made that Weird Al bootleg
6940000	6941000	Oh Billy Joel
6942000	6944000	Don't you try to make my songs
6944000	6945000	any weirder
6946000	6947000	I'm gonna put some grease
6947000	6948000	in a cracker jack
6948000	6950000	And put a Studebaker on my shoe
6952000	6954000	We should just do the lamest version
6954000	6956000	Just change up down to downtown
6956000	6957000	Just to piss him off
6957000	6958000	Down town girl
6959000	6962000	You been puttin' on a cracker jack world
6963000	6966000	Got a guitar in a six string hell

6984000	6986000	I collect her snot
6986000	6988000	on a Lincoln Luck
6989000	6992000	She'll see I'm not so tough
6993000	6994000	Just a box of snuff

6996000	6998000	and a top top gun
