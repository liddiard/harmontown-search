0	1000	Are you ready to be the happiest you've ever been in your entire life?
1000	2000	Welcome to Harmentown.
2000	3000	Harmentown is now in session.
3000	4000	Please welcome to stage the third.
4000	5000	Harmentown, fifth grade.
5000	6000	Daniel James Harman.
6000	7000	Go.
7000	8000	Go.
8000	9000	Go.
9000	10000	Go.
10000	10000	
30000	41000	Go.
41000	43000	Oh, really? These are more expensive down here?
43000	45000	Sure.
45000	47000	All right.
47000	49000	For podcast listeners, we are in a room for the sake of
49000	51000	description.
51000	55000	It's like a beautiful kind of expensive beachwood thrust has
55000	60000	been placed in the middle of a driver's ed class.
60000	68000	And there's like an orchestra pit with VIP booths that are
68000	72000	nerdy audience could not afford to sit in.
72000	77000	Well, that means I should probably put me out of the
77000	80000	light, right? I'll be in the dark.
80000	83000	For the listeners, this club has a runway.
83000	85000	Yeah. I just moved down the thrust.
85000	89000	It's like a runway. It's like a Katy Perry concert.
89000	95000	Hello, Kansas City. We have a limited time here at
96000	98000	the strip mall.
98000	101000	There's another show coming out next.
101000	104000	How many of you are from Kansas City?
104000	108000	So that means the rest of you traveled.
108000	111000	Who drove the farthest?
111000	112000	Omaha.
112000	114000	I heard Omaha.
114000	117000	Tulsa? Is Tulsa further than Omaha?
117000	119000	Tulsa's got us beat.
119000	122000	I realize that's a tough spot that I put you in when I'm
123000	125000	like, who drove the farthest?
125000	128000	There's like an unspoken edge to that question.
128000	133000	Who lives with their mom the most?
133000	137000	But I thank you so much for anybody that came even five
137000	139000	minutes, even if you walked here.
139000	144000	Even if you were forced to be here, thank you for being here.
144000	148000	Everybody eat at that dinosaur place?
148000	150000	That's pretty badass.
150000	154000	I couldn't believe how high I forgot to get before I ate
154000	155000	there.
155000	158000	I kept wondering, I know a lot of people probably smoke a
158000	160000	lot of pot and go to the dinosaur place.
160000	163000	A lot of people probably take mushrooms and go to the
163000	164000	dinosaur place.
164000	166000	But I kept wondering, does anyone ever do coke here?
166000	170000	Like at an executive luncheon?
170000	174000	Does anybody meet in the bathroom there and kind of do a
174000	177000	bump under a stegosaurus tail?
177000	178000	Hey, Dan.
178000	179000	Yes, Erin.
179000	181000	Stay on that thought.
181000	183000	Oh, shit.
183000	184000	Oh, shit.
184000	186000	Rapping about coke.
186000	188000	Oh, shit.
188000	190000	Oh, runway.
190000	193000	Wrap to the titty, wrap Kansas City, wrap, wrap to your
193000	195000	mama, wrap all about that.
195000	199000	Fuck your mama north, fuck your mama south, Kansas City,
199000	200000	north, south.
200000	202000	Half of it is in Missouri.
202000	205000	Half your mama is out to jury.
205000	207000	Half your mama's been voted back.
207000	210000	Half your mama is with darn crack.
210000	212000	Half of it is in the state of Kansas.
212000	215000	Half of your mama took down my pansies, sucked my dick,
215000	219000	licked my nuts, fingered my nose, put it in my butt, so I
219000	221000	had a booger in my butt.
221000	222000	It was gross.
222000	223000	It was gross.
223000	224000	Sorry.
224000	226000	Sorry about that.
226000	231000	Yeah.
231000	232000	Thank you.
233000	237000	I don't know if I'm supposed to be distracted by this or
237000	240000	not, but I keep imagining the show from the perspective of
240000	243000	the people that work here.
243000	246000	You guys don't seem like regular clients of this particular
246000	248000	place, and they don't see it.
248000	250000	Like, I keep wondering, I keep putting myself in their shoes
250000	253000	and going, what is a podcast?
253000	254000	What is this show?
254000	255000	What is going on?
255000	258000	They put it on the door that it's a nationally televised
258000	259000	podcast.
259000	262000	Nationally televised.
262000	264000	Funny on two levels.
264000	265000	Yeah.
265000	268000	Not televised, not just national.
268000	271000	So they've got to be confused right now.
271000	276000	But can I ask this question?
276000	279000	I know like 60 of you bought tickets online, which I assume
279000	282000	means 60 of you listened to the podcast.
282000	285000	How many of you by applause are in that other category of
285000	288000	people that wandered in here wondering what kind of comedy
288000	291000	you know what I mean?
291000	293000	It's kind of like this back wall.
293000	294000	There's like a tear.
294000	295000	There's like a pit.
295000	298000	There's a pit of nerds.
298000	303000	And then there's a Sesame Street brick wall with comics that
303000	306000	are doing the next show and people from Kansas City.
306000	307000	But welcome, welcome.
307000	308000	We welcome you here.
308000	309000	Welcome.
309000	311000	I hope you like live sex on stage.
311000	314000	That's how we close our show.
315000	318000	So I don't understand.
318000	321000	Is there anybody that works in local government here that can
321000	325000	explain how the, isn't your city split down the middle and
325000	328000	half of it's in one state and half of it's in the other?
328000	333000	So is there anybody that is kind of like an expert on how that
333000	337000	works and why, like wants to come up and explain that to me
337000	340000	or we don't, all right, yeah.
340000	341000	You just hate it.
341000	343000	You're just beleaguered by the civil war that is happening and
344000	345000	Kansas City.
345000	346000	All right.
346000	347000	Fine.
347000	348000	Guess what?
348000	349000	I don't care.
349000	350000	I pretended to care for a second.
350000	352000	I don't care that your city is split down the middle between
352000	353000	two states.
353000	356000	I grew up thinking that there were two Kansas cities, that
356000	358000	that's why there was a Kansas City, Missouri, and a Kansas
358000	359000	City, Kansas.
359000	361000	I thought that there was actually just two places called
361000	362000	Kansas City.
362000	365000	And I found out, I think today, that, oh, okay.
365000	366000	There's a, yeah.
366000	368000	So, all right.
368000	372000	So there's a lot of tension between the halfs of the cities
373000	375000	and what I've done is I've made the mistake of calling it one
375000	376000	city.
376000	377000	I should call it two.
377000	379000	You guys are the separatists.
379000	384000	You're the people who believe that the other Kansas City should
384000	386000	get up and walk away.
386000	388000	And most of you drove from Omaha.
388000	389000	Okay.
389000	390000	No one cares.
390000	393000	How's Nebraska?
393000	397000	Oh, everybody hates where they're from.
397000	399000	Nobody, everybody wants to be a hero.
399000	401000	Everybody wants to just go away and kill themselves.
402000	406000	Or rescue a family of orphans from a fire.
406000	408000	No one wants to just be where they're from.
408000	411000	And nobody out in the audience is waving a giant foam finger
411000	412000	for anything.
412000	420000	I want, I'm worried tonight because I was looking at my
420000	423000	story circle, for those of you who are familiar with that.
423000	428000	For the back row, I'm only famous for making a TV show that I
428000	430000	got fired off of.
430000	432000	And then just barely.
432000	434000	Only 3 million people watched that.
434000	436000	And then I'm famous for getting fired off of it.
436000	441000	And then during the time that I was making it, this story
441000	444000	circle that I had developed years ago kind of came to light.
444000	447000	And I'm kind of obsessed with it, what makes a story and stuff.
447000	450000	And we're doing this tour documentary about the show,
450000	453000	about me going on the road, talking about nothing and not
453000	454000	having an act.
455000	458000	And I've been placing myself on this circle.
458000	462000	And the truth of the matter is that on my circle, on my story
462000	467000	circle, according to my arithmetic, tonight represents a
467000	468000	horrible death.
468000	473000	Like tonight is a night of horrible, like something bad
473000	475000	is going to happen.
475000	476000	Something bad is already happening.
476000	478000	Yes, thank you comics.
478000	483000	I understand that compared to what you do, this is already
483000	484000	death.
484000	486000	Like you would have already gone, okay, I did a bad job.
486000	487000	I'm fired.
487000	489000	But podcasting is different.
489000	490000	It's different.
490000	492000	It's more like NPR.
492000	497000	It's not, you know, if 20 minutes of silence goes by, it
497000	499000	might be captivating.
499000	501000	Maybe it's not hilarious.
501000	504000	Also this room is more brightly lit than anywhere I've ever
504000	506000	been in my entire life.
506000	510000	If the show goes poorly, it won't be a secret.
510000	511000	Everyone's face.
511000	516000	Hello, man, with a beautiful spearmint scarf over there.
516000	517000	I like that.
517000	519000	Also the cloud tie-dye in the back.
519000	520000	I like that.
520000	521000	You can see all the colors.
521000	523000	I'm demonstrating how bright it is.
523000	524000	Yeah.
524000	529000	We can see the ghost of impending doom hanging over,
529000	532000	standing in the back, shaking his head, giving a thumbs down.
532000	534000	We can see all the way.
534000	536000	We don't like it when we can see nothing.
536000	537000	That's no good either.
537000	543000	But anyways, what was I talking about, Aaron?
543000	546000	You were talking about?
546000	547000	Death.
547000	548000	Right.
548000	549000	Oh, okay.
549000	550000	Death.
550000	551000	Yeah.
551000	553000	Yo, yo, yo.
553000	554000	Rapping.
554000	556000	Rapping about death.
556000	557000	Hold your breath.
557000	559000	Good to go six feet under.
559000	562000	Front your mama like I was blundering.
562000	564000	Looking where to put my dick.
564000	568000	Couldn't find a place to pick a hickory stick instead of my penis.
568000	571000	Fuck your mama like Dukes of Hazzard's Enus.
571000	573000	It was a character from the 80s.
573000	576000	I fucked your mama like she was just another lady.
576000	577000	But she wasn't.
577000	579000	Her ass was fine.
579000	581000	I fucked your mama down the county line.
581000	583000	I got Roscoe Coltrane going.
583000	584000	Do, do, do.
584000	585000	Fuck his mama.
585000	586000	Do, do, do.
586000	587000	All right.
587000	590000	Yeah.
590000	601000	For the guys in the back that don't know what the show is, that's not part of the show.
601000	605000	We're only doing that because we're in Kansas City.
605000	608000	We heard you like barbecue and freestyle rapping.
608000	611000	And so we're just doing it to make you comfortable.
611000	613000	These guys are like, what's he doing?
613000	614000	Why is he doing that?
614000	615000	He's selling out the show.
615000	618000	Stop rapping about Enus.
619000	621000	A couple Dukes of Hazzard references in there.
621000	622000	I apologize.
622000	623000	Everyone's 25.
623000	624000	I didn't mean to do that.
624000	625000	There was a movie.
625000	628000	Maybe you can Google it.
628000	630000	Death.
630000	632000	Tonight is going to happen.
632000	635000	You're going to witness a transformation hopefully.
635000	640000	I think it's going to come at the hands of Spencer because I was thinking about it.
640000	642000	And we should bring them up here.
642000	643000	Spencer, can you come out?
643000	646000	Spencer to the stage.
654000	656000	Kansas City.
656000	658000	Right.
658000	660000	Spencer, this is your first hair down show.
660000	661000	My first what?
661000	662000	Oh, yeah.
662000	664000	First show with your hair down.
664000	665000	Yeah, like Jesus.
665000	666000	Yeah.
666000	667000	Or like Party Jesus.
667000	669000	You're letting it loose for Kansas City.
669000	672000	Fat frat boy Jesus.
672000	675000	Gotta die on stage.
675000	679000	For you guys in the back, Spencer is the podcast's dungeon master.
679000	681000	Sold you yet?
681000	683000	Sold you yet?
685000	688000	Sound a little more marketable?
688000	690000	We have a dungeon master.
690000	693000	We play Dungeons and Dragons on the show.
696000	700000	Spencer, I'm starting to think, in accordance with my story model,
700000	704000	this is the hero of the tour because unlike me,
704000	707000	he is actually going through changes, aren't you, Spencer?
707000	708000	Yeah, yeah.
708000	711000	I hit puberty a couple days ago.
711000	713000	It came on fast.
713000	715000	Yeah.
715000	718000	But you have been whisked across a threshold by a horrible,
718000	721000	wealthy fat guy and stuck in a tour bus that he rented
721000	724000	so he could go out and masturbate on stage.
724000	728000	And you, yourself, are experiencing new things and adapting and changing.
728000	732000	And we're almost done with the tour and I haven't changed in any way.
732000	734000	So it occurred to me this morning that I must be the villain
734000	738000	and Spencer must be the hero, which means that Spencer must die.
738000	740000	Or that I must die.
740000	742000	And that must either happen in Dungeons and Dragons
742000	745000	or it will happen just in the show.
745000	750000	So Spencer, let me have it, fucking lay waste to me.
750000	752000	What?
752000	754000	Undo me at the seams.
754000	756000	Tell me what my problem is.
756000	757000	Tell me why I'm a piece of shit.
757000	760000	You want to know what your problem is.
760000	766000	You're so generous that you bought me a Dave and Buster's card.
766000	769000	But it was only for...
769000	773000	That was the false death gong.
773000	775000	Spencer.
775000	778000	Okay, so when you come to the ticket window,
778000	781000	do they go, okay, your seat's in the room,
781000	785000	but do you want it to be in the front because that'll cost $5 extra?
785000	792000	And do they offer it or that was just offered online
792000	794000	and you just didn't check the box that said,
794000	797000	I would like the luxury Coke booth.
797000	799000	All right.
799000	801000	That's such wasted space.
801000	805000	Is it possible to have just one person in each of these booths?
805000	806000	Would that be weird?
806000	808000	Let's pick some VIPs.
808000	809000	VIPs?
809000	811000	Okay, we got a VIP there.
811000	814000	We put on a little VIP music.
814000	817000	You came to Harman Town and you thought that you were...
817000	819000	Well, wait, we don't want to separate couples.
819000	822000	You look like you came here by yourself, no offense.
822000	825000	Are you single and want to boot alone to watch Harman Town?
825000	828000	Would you be willing to come up and talk to us first?
828000	830000	We don't bully anybody at Harman Town.
830000	832000	Can I help you up?
832000	835000	We don't bring people up to pick on them.
835000	836000	What's your name, sir?
836000	838000	My name is Kyle.
838000	839000	Kyle.
839000	841000	So are you one of the people that...
841000	842000	You're not familiar with the podcast?
842000	843000	Oh, no.
843000	844000	No, I'm very familiar with it.
844000	845000	Oh, you are?
845000	846000	Okay.
846000	847000	All right.
847000	848000	No, no, no, no, no.
848000	850000	You came here by yourself?
850000	854000	Yeah, I couldn't get my wife to come after she listened.
854000	857000	I should not have let her listen.
857000	860000	What episode did your wife listen to?
860000	863000	It was Pittsburgh.
866000	868000	It wasn't our relationship that made her...
868000	869000	No, no.
869000	871000	She might have come if she'd have heard that part.
871000	873000	Tell us the exact point where she said...
873000	875000	She didn't like the funky mama raps.
875000	877000	What's her name?
877000	878000	April.
878000	879000	April!
879000	881000	More like...
881000	883000	April!
883000	884000	Check it!
891000	893000	April, heard you don't like my show.
893000	895000	I fucked your mama, and here's how it goes.
895000	896000	What's your mom's name?
896000	897000	Pat.
897000	898000	I fucked your mama, Pat.
898000	900000	I fucked her so hard she started to ignore she's Pat.
900000	903000	Flattened her out like she was a pancake.
903000	906000	Fucked Pat and gave her man cake better.
906000	908000	On her face.
908000	911000	I fucked Pat so hard she turned into a different race.
911000	914000	Genetically altered.
914000	916000	Fucked her till my dick faltered.
916000	917000	Sorry. Sorry.
917000	918000	No, okay.
918000	919000	No, no, no.
919000	920000	Sweetie, please.
920000	921000	No, sweet.
921000	922000	No, no.
922000	923000	I said stop.
923000	924000	It's okay.
924000	925000	Again?
925000	926000	A different one?
926000	927000	No, no, no.
927000	928000	No, sweetie, please.
928000	929000	I fucked Pat.
929000	930000	I fucked Pat.
930000	931000	I fucked Pat.
931000	932000	Outro?
932000	933000	Thanks for coming.
933000	934000	No, no.
934000	935000	Sweetie, no.
935000	936000	No, for God's sake.
936000	937000	We just got to know Kyle.
937000	938000	Okay.
938000	939000	All right.
939000	941000	Here comes the April monster.
941000	942000	We heard the fog on.
942000	943000	All right, Kyle.
943000	944000	Oh, okay.
944000	947000	Yeah, can you do the April monster?
947000	951000	You hear the sounds of far-off showers.
951000	953000	April approaches.
953000	956000	With a steady foot and clever hand,
956000	960000	you're sure that May flowers are soon to follow.
960000	961000	All right, great.
961000	965000	All right, Kyle, why don't you sit in the VIP booth to the right?
965000	968000	Thank you, Kyle.
968000	972000	I assume you should keep it clean and set up for...
972000	975000	Don't make them mad.
975000	978000	Don't get popcorn everywhere or anything.
978000	982500	Dance, we reserved the VIP section for people who weren't able to get their friends to come
982500	984000	because they don't like the show.
984000	985000	Yes, yes, exactly.
985000	989000	Is there anyone else who had to come alone because everyone but them hates the thing?
989000	991000	Let's start from the back.
991000	992000	Wait, no, no, no.
992000	993000	It'll be okay.
993000	994000	What's your name, sir?
994000	995000	Tim.
995000	996000	Tim, come on up.
996000	999000	This is Tim's song.
1005000	1007000	Are you okay coming up and talking to us?
1007000	1008000	Yeah.
1008000	1009000	Okay, come on up, Tim.
1009000	1010000	Tim knows about that.
1010000	1011000	Okay, Tim.
1011000	1013000	You're from Kansas City, or...?
1013000	1014000	I moved here in May, so...
1014000	1015000	Okay.
1015000	1016000	Why'd you move?
1016000	1017000	I got a job here.
1017000	1019000	Where were you before that?
1019000	1020000	I was in college.
1020000	1021000	Okay.
1021000	1022000	So you got...
1022000	1027000	At Planet College or in a location?
1027000	1031000	Where were you going to college?
1031000	1033000	At the University of Missouri in Columbia.
1033000	1035000	Whoa!
1035000	1036000	All right, all right.
1036000	1037000	So obviously...
1037000	1038000	Kyle, I'm so sorry.
1038000	1041000	Now you understand why you didn't say anything.
1041000	1042000	All right.
1042000	1043000	It was.
1043000	1044000	That's a big deal.
1044000	1045000	You'll live.
1045000	1046000	Whoa.
1046000	1047000	It seems like...
1047000	1048000	All right.
1048000	1050000	We love everyone in Hermit Town.
1050000	1054300	I'm starting to think that really giving these guys the time of their lives would just talk
1054300	1056000	shit about Missouri all night.
1056000	1059000	But you would know that I didn't mean it.
1059000	1063920	Like, I would just be wandering into this, like, conflict you're having.
1063920	1067960	From my perspective as the wandering hero, it's a Lilliputian conflict that doesn't...
1067960	1068960	I don't know what it means.
1068960	1069960	It's like...
1069960	1071620	It makes you guys feel better.
1071620	1073880	It seems adorable.
1073880	1074880	I do like it.
1074880	1078000	I wish I had something like that with...
1078000	1079000	The Kansas City, Missouri...
1079000	1082960	The Kansas-Missouri feud does start at the Civil War, which is the favorite of Hermit
1082960	1083960	Town.
1083960	1084960	Oh, okay.
1084960	1085960	Yeah.
1085960	1086960	I've been talking about the Civil War a lot on this tour.
1086960	1087960	All right.
1087960	1088960	It was Ken?
1088960	1089960	Tim?
1089960	1090960	That's close enough on my part.
1090960	1091960	All right.
1091960	1094960	You want to take the VIP booth to the left and please keep it clean.
1094960	1095960	Don't.
1096960	1098960	We got Tim and Kyle, right?
1098960	1101960	Does anyone else deserve to be a VIP?
1102960	1103960	Do you guys feel...
1103960	1104960	Does this feel nice?
1104960	1106960	Is it comfortable?
1106960	1109960	How much more would you pay for this booth?
1111960	1112960	Okay, you can't put a price on it.
1112960	1113960	Well, you didn't.
1113960	1115960	You didn't buy the fucking booth.
1115960	1117960	You guys were offered it.
1117960	1118960	You cheaped out.
1118960	1121960	But you're getting a taste because you came here alone.
1121960	1126960	If we put a whole family in these booths, then we'd be stealing money from the
1126960	1127960	venue.
1127960	1129960	But because you're alone, you won't be able to share it with anybody, so it's
1129960	1131960	like it didn't happen.
1131960	1135960	For the listener, we've said this already, but there are four booths that seem
1135960	1137960	like the only seats in the entire...
1137960	1141960	Yeah, but mathematically, if we take that time to put one person in each booth,
1141960	1142960	then we have to leave.
1142960	1143960	Then that's the show.
1143960	1146960	Like, we only have a certain amount of time up here.
1147960	1148960	I like Tim and Kyle.
1148960	1151960	They're kind of like Statler and Waldorf.
1157960	1159960	But so was the Edinburgh.
1161960	1162960	All right, all right.
1162960	1163960	So we got some buddies up here.
1163960	1164960	They're VIPs.
1164960	1165960	It's good to see VIPs at the show.
1165960	1166960	That's good.
1167960	1168960	Let's see.
1169960	1170960	All right.
1170960	1172960	Who is in the most pain tonight?
1172960	1176960	Like the most devastating, maybe not physical, maybe emotional...
1177960	1178960	I just saw a woman.
1178960	1179960	Let's shake her head now.
1180960	1182960	And that's her, right?
1182960	1183960	All right.
1183960	1186960	You want to come up here and share your pain?
1186960	1187960	I just quit smoking.
1187960	1188960	Oh, you just quit smoking.
1188960	1190960	I quit smoking eight years ago.
1190960	1191960	I used to smoke two packs a day.
1191960	1193960	Do you want me to hypnotize you?
1193960	1195960	Yeah, come on down.
1196960	1197960	Okay.
1197960	1199960	Can we find some cosmic music?
1199960	1201960	Or no, we don't have any, do we?
1202960	1208960	Is there a woman in the audience who thinks she can pull off a reasonable Enya?
1209960	1211960	A reasonable copyright-free...
1211960	1213960	There's a guy raising his hand, okay.
1213960	1214960	Let's bring him up.
1220960	1224960	This is exactly how I dressed on Prom Night, but I wasn't going anywhere.
1225960	1226960	I'm Jeff Understudy.
1226960	1227960	Jeff Davis is Understudy?
1227960	1228960	What's your name?
1228960	1229960	Ryan.
1229960	1231960	You look like John Cryer in Hiding Out.
1232960	1234960	I get Matthew Broderick a lot.
1234960	1235960	Oh, right, okay.
1235960	1236960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1236960	1239960	Yeah, he's a little Cryer, a little Broderick, all Jeff Davis.
1239960	1240960	All rock and roll.
1240960	1241960	Oh, sorry, what's your name?
1241960	1242960	Did we get your name?
1242960	1243960	Ryan, yeah.
1243960	1244960	Ryan, okay.
1244960	1245960	All right.
1245960	1246960	Can we give him a special mic, special Enya mic?
1246960	1247960	There you go.
1247960	1248960	Thank you.
1248960	1249960	And your name was, I forgot, already?
1250960	1251960	Ian.
1251960	1252960	Ian?
1252960	1253960	Yeah.
1253960	1254960	Okay.
1254960	1255960	Were you hoping that smoke would come out?
1255960	1257960	All right, we're going to...
1257960	1258960	Ian, we're going to take...
1258960	1261960	You just sit right there and just let...
1261960	1262960	You're just going to...
1262960	1264960	You're never going to smoke again after this, okay?
1264960	1265960	Oh, yeah.
1265960	1266960	Do it every night.
1266960	1267960	Okay, all right.
1267960	1268960	Okay, I need...
1268960	1269960	If there's anyone...
1269960	1272960	I'm not going to hold my breath, but if anyone's controlling the house lights,
1272960	1274960	I need to bring them down a little bit.
1274960	1275960	Okay, I didn't...
1275960	1276960	Yeah.
1276960	1279960	We're on the face of the sun and no one is paying attention to the show.
1279960	1280960	Who works here?
1281960	1284960	We're Lash Key kids.
1284960	1285960	Yeah.
1285960	1287960	All right, so maybe just...
1287960	1289960	Just give him some Hot Pockets in a $5 bill.
1289960	1294960	Maybe just close your eyes and...
1294960	1295960	Ryan?
1295960	1296960	Yeah.
1296960	1298960	Okay, start and yang, but in a copyright-free way.
1298960	1299960	Okay.
1299960	1302960	Who can say what...
1302960	1303960	All right, too many lyrics.
1303960	1305960	Too many lyrics.
1305960	1307960	I just need like tones.
1307960	1309960	Just like meditative tones.
1309960	1310960	Well, maybe...
1310960	1311960	May I suggest something?
1311960	1313960	Because he's dressed like Jeff Davis.
1313960	1314960	Okay.
1314960	1316960	And he's dressed like his understudy.
1316960	1317960	Can we just switch places?
1317960	1319960	I can be the audience volunteer.
1319960	1320960	Yeah.
1320960	1321960	And I'll do some tones.
1321960	1322960	Oh, you want to Comptroller?
1322960	1323960	I'll do some tones and he can Comptroller.
1323960	1324960	All right, okay.
1324960	1325960	All right.
1326960	1327960	That's good, Erin.
1327960	1328960	Thank you.
1328960	1329960	That's smart thinking.
1329960	1332960	That's good Comptroller, realizing that he...
1332960	1336960	Of course, John Cryer should be Comptroller and you should be the woman.
1337960	1338960	Well, that sounds sexist.
1338960	1340960	So, Dan says to me all the time, you should be the woman.
1340960	1341960	Of course.
1341960	1343960	I should be eating ice cream and you should be the woman,
1343960	1345960	meaning give me a spoon.
1346960	1347960	Okay.
1347960	1349960	So, John Cryer, you take it easy for a second.
1349960	1350960	Got it.
1350960	1352960	Erin, you start taking us on a cosmic journey.
1352960	1355960	Everyone else, lower the house lights in your mind.
1357960	1359960	Literally, no one is paying attention to the show.
1359960	1360960	We're going to help.
1360960	1361960	Oh, okay.
1362960	1363960	We had some go out.
1363960	1364960	Nice.
1364960	1365960	Cool.
1365960	1366960	And this is to help...
1366960	1367960	God damn it, Ryan?
1367960	1368960	What was your name?
1368960	1369960	Ken.
1369960	1370960	Ian.
1370960	1371960	Ian.
1371960	1372960	All right.
1372960	1373960	I've met a lot of people, all right?
1373960	1374960	You know what?
1374960	1376960	They wouldn't ride my ass like this in Missouri.
1378960	1382960	So, just be careful.
1382960	1385960	Because you might wake up with a different label on you.
1385960	1387960	You know, they could switch to the sides of the city
1387960	1388960	like that overnight.
1388960	1389960	All right.
1390960	1391960	Ian.
1393960	1397960	Ian, you are losing control of your body.
1398960	1400960	Not in a poopy way.
1401960	1405960	Just drifting, your consciousness is drifting out of your corporeal frame.
1406960	1409960	You are rising, Ian, into the reaches of space.
1411960	1414960	Ian, there's a giant cigarette in front of you.
1416960	1418960	You reach for it.
1419960	1421960	Scorpions run out of it.
1422960	1423960	Up your hand.
1423960	1425960	No sound effects.
1426960	1427960	Sorry.
1427960	1428960	Well, you don't have to be sorry.
1428960	1429960	Just don't do it again.
1431960	1432960	Sorry, Ian.
1432960	1433960	Try to relax.
1433960	1435960	Scorpions crawling up your arm.
1436960	1438960	The largest of them, the mother,
1440960	1442960	crawls over your ear,
1442960	1444960	at which point the baby's on her underbelly.
1444960	1448960	All eight million of them go into your inner ear canal
1450960	1452960	and lay eggs in your brain.
1452960	1453960	That's right.
1453960	1458960	Baby scorpions lay eggs only in a smoker's brain.
1459960	1461960	Now they're hatching, Ian.
1461960	1463960	Your brain is all scorpions.
1463960	1467960	You return to Earth craving nicotine,
1467960	1469960	bent on a murderous spree.
1469960	1471960	You sting your family.
1471960	1473960	You sting your friends.
1473960	1475960	You sting everyone.
1475960	1477960	It's a metaphor for secondhand smoke.
1478960	1480960	But now, Ian, now,
1481960	1484960	now you come to a giant apple pie
1485960	1487960	and you climb inside it
1487960	1489960	and you eat the whole thing
1489960	1491960	because you quit smoking.
1491960	1493960	And every time you quit smoking,
1494960	1496960	you get a giant apple pie.
1498960	1499960	Ryan?
1499960	1500960	Ian?
1500960	1501960	No, Ian.
1501960	1502960	Sorry.
1502960	1503960	Sorry.
1503960	1504960	Sorry.
1504960	1505960	Ian?
1506960	1508960	There's a monster truck coming up the street
1508960	1509960	to the apple pie.
1510960	1512960	It pulls up outside the apple pie.
1514960	1515960	Hulk Hogan gets out.
1517960	1521960	He gives you one of his patented Hulk Hogan hand gestures.
1523960	1526960	You can tell you're cool with him now.
1526960	1528960	He doesn't smoke either.
1528960	1529960	Did he die?
1529960	1530960	Did Hulk Hogan die?
1530960	1531960	No, he's alive.
1531960	1532960	He's alive.
1532960	1533960	It's cool.
1533960	1534960	If he died, he's a ghost and it's still cool.
1534960	1535960	He was just involved in a scandal
1535960	1536960	and a sex scandal, but he's fine.
1538960	1540960	You take Hulk Hogan by the hand
1540960	1542960	and you go into a field, Ian,
1543960	1545960	and you play Frisbee.
1546960	1548960	He takes you to a water fountain
1548960	1551960	and you drink cool, fresh, refreshing water
1551960	1552960	with Hulk Hogan.
1553960	1555960	And then you notice as you're drinking
1555960	1557960	that he's touching you.
1558960	1560960	But you don't care
1560960	1562960	because you look around
1562960	1565960	and you see from a nearby calendar sculpture
1565960	1566960	that it's the year 2080
1566960	1569960	and homosexuality is not taboo anymore.
1570960	1571960	It's a hologram statue.
1571960	1573960	It's designed so that you can look at it from any angle
1573960	1575960	so it's not coincidence that you see it.
1575960	1577960	It's not bad story writing on my part.
1579960	1581960	It's just how it works.
1581960	1582960	You're in the year 2080
1582960	1583960	and Hulk Hogan is rubbing your crotch
1583960	1585960	as you drink cool water.
1585960	1587960	Your belly's full of apple pie
1587960	1589960	and you have an orgasm.
1590960	1591960	Now wake up.
1592960	1593960	Do you want a cigarette, Ian?
1593960	1594960	Fuck yeah.
1594960	1595960	All right.
1595960	1597960	Well pretend he said no.
1600960	1601960	You want one,
1601960	1603960	but you know that baby scorpions
1603960	1605960	are going to lay eggs in your brain.
1606960	1607960	All right.
1607960	1608960	I'm glad I could help, Ian.
1608960	1610960	Spencer, how are we doing on time?
1610960	1611960	Do we have to play Dungeons and Dragons?
1611960	1612960	Oh shit, I'm sorry.
1612960	1613960	I should be asking Ryan.
1613960	1614960	Oh, it's 634.
1614960	1615960	634.
1616960	1617960	That's a time bet.
1618960	1619960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1620960	1621960	What you're realizing now
1621960	1623960	is that we have not been up here
1623960	1624960	for very long.
1624960	1625960	Oh, right.
1627960	1628960	Usually time goes so much faster.
1628960	1629960	I don't know why.
1630960	1634960	Ryan, if you could have anything,
1634960	1635960	what do you want?
1635960	1636960	What is your dream?
1636960	1637960	What's my dream?
1638960	1641960	I actually want to do stand-up comedy
1641960	1644960	and I want to be a writer for TV, actually.
1645960	1646960	That's why I'm here.
1647960	1650960	Do you have a strong two minutes, Ryan?
1651960	1652960	Yeah.
1652960	1653960	Yeah, I could do two.
1653960	1655960	Do you want to come out in the thrust
1655960	1656960	and do them to an audience
1656960	1657960	of Kansas City Comics?
1658960	1659960	Ryan, we're back.
1662960	1664960	Here, I'll do you the favor.
1664960	1666960	I'll give you a horrible opener
1666960	1668960	so that the bar is lowered for you.
1669960	1670960	Ladies and gentlemen,
1670960	1672960	welcome to Nickelbackers.
1674960	1675960	Please remember,
1675960	1677960	Rob Schneider will be here next week,
1677960	1679960	the star of Sheeps of Heaven.
1681960	1684960	And on all next week, it's Ladies Night.
1684960	1685960	All the ladies get to be ladies.
1685960	1686960	You don't get anything for free.
1686960	1688960	We just won't punch you.
1693960	1694960	You don't have to boo that.
1696960	1698960	We're not proud of our policies here, ma'am,
1698960	1699960	at Nickelbackers.
1701960	1702960	Now coming to the stage,
1702960	1704960	the opener for tonight's act.
1704960	1705960	It's not you, Ryan.
1705960	1706960	It's just a different guy.
1706960	1708960	Schmeagol Flangerhäng.
1712960	1713960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1713960	1715960	You ever notice that Chinese people
1715960	1716960	are inferior?
1716960	1718960	Whoa!
1718960	1719960	What are they eating?
1719960	1720960	Why are they eating it?
1720960	1721960	Whoa!
1721960	1722960	Hey, come on now.
1722960	1723960	What are you talking about?
1723960	1724960	Knock, knock.
1724960	1726960	Who's there?
1726960	1727960	Fuck you.
1727960	1728960	I'm racist.
1728960	1730960	Whoa!
1730960	1731960	I got AIDS in my blood.
1731960	1733960	I'm spraying it on the audience.
1733960	1735960	Whoa!
1735960	1736960	It's like Gallagher,
1736960	1738960	but you got AIDS now.
1738960	1740960	Whoa!
1740960	1742960	Okay, well, I'd like to settle it down
1742960	1744960	for a minute and tell you about my wife.
1744960	1747960	Veronica, she's struggling with breast cancer,
1747960	1750960	and there's a table of T-shirts in the back.
1750960	1752960	I'd really like you to buy them.
1752960	1754960	Oh, thank you very much.
1754960	1755960	I've received a note
1755960	1757960	that all your cars have been stolen,
1757960	1760960	and wherever they are,
1760960	1762960	there's people sleeping in them.
1762960	1764960	But the people sleeping in them
1764960	1767960	are covered with little tiny spikes
1767960	1769960	filled with poison.
1769960	1771960	So let them be,
1771960	1774960	and then you'll be okay,
1774960	1775960	and you just need a new car,
1775960	1776960	and all your lives are ruined.
1776960	1779960	Also, you have AIDS.
1779960	1781960	All right, well, I guess I did pretty poorly
1781960	1782960	with my stand-up act,
1782960	1785960	but we're gonna bring a new guy to the stage.
1785960	1789960	He's gonna do two strong minutes of stand-up
1789960	1792960	because he's a well-respected stand-up comic.
1792960	1794960	He's performed at clubs and colleges
1794960	1796960	all over the thingamabob.
1796960	1798960	Please welcome Ryan Salomon!
1799960	1800960	Hey, guys.
1800960	1802960	Thanks for coming out here.
1802960	1804960	You look great.
1804960	1805960	I don't know about you guys.
1805960	1808960	Every time I see Channing Tatum in a movie,
1808960	1809960	all I can think is
1809960	1812960	how much better Ryan Gosling would have been.
1812960	1814960	And every time I kiss my wife,
1814960	1815960	all I can think is
1815960	1818960	how much better Ryan Gosling would have been.
1818960	1819960	And when I say that,
1819960	1820960	people usually ask me,
1820960	1821960	and by people I mean my wife,
1821960	1824960	Ryan, do you mean
1824960	1825960	you can't help but think
1825960	1827960	of how much better Ryan Gosling would have been?
1827960	1828960	You can't help but think
1828960	1829960	of how much better Ryan Gosling would have been
1829960	1830960	at kissing you
1830960	1832960	or how much better Ryan Gosling would have been
1832960	1834960	at kissing your wife.
1834960	1837960	And the answer is either.
1837960	1838960	Both.
1838960	1839960	In an ideal world,
1839960	1841960	my wife and I would never kiss each other.
1841960	1844960	There'd just be two Ryan Goslings
1844960	1847960	sharing a tender embrace.
1847960	1850960	Have you guys ever done something horrible,
1850960	1851960	like just so bad
1851960	1852960	you just never wanted to tell anybody?
1852960	1853960	No, good.
1853960	1854960	You're perfect.
1854960	1855960	Thank you.
1855960	1857960	Well, for the rest of you,
1857960	1859960	you should do something terrible.
1859960	1860960	You just don't want to even bring up again.
1860960	1862960	Like you're messing around with some friends
1862960	1864960	in the woods and you push one
1864960	1866960	and he falls and he breaks his nose
1866960	1869960	and there's so much blood that you just run away.
1869960	1871960	That didn't happen.
1871960	1873960	Or maybe like in college,
1873960	1874960	a bunch of girls run into your dorm room
1874960	1876960	and steal a bunch of your stuff.
1876960	1877960	So to get them back,
1877960	1878960	you take one of the flashlights
1878960	1879960	that you're borrowing from one of them
1879960	1882960	and you just take a shit in it
1882960	1884960	and then you give it to her.
1884960	1886960	And then like a couple of years later,
1886960	1888960	you just go ahead and you marry her.
1888960	1890960	Yeah, that did happen.
1890960	1892960	That did happen.
1892960	1893960	Several years ago,
1893960	1895960	I was going on a mission trip
1895960	1897960	with a church when I was in high school
1897960	1899960	and we were going to help
1899960	1901960	just some people in West Virginia
1901960	1902960	and a few months prior,
1902960	1905960	a woman had tragically lost her son,
1905960	1907960	her very young son, in a car accident
1907960	1912960	and the weeks before it happened,
1912960	1915960	he kept saying that he saw a bunny in the yard
1915960	1918960	and his mom never saw it.
1918960	1920960	And after the horrible event,
1920960	1921960	she got this package,
1921960	1923960	it was a statue of a bunny
1923960	1925960	and it didn't say who it was from.
1925960	1927960	So she was like very confused.
1927960	1929960	She was like, where did this come from?
1929960	1931960	And while we were on the trip,
1931960	1934960	after a particularly rowdy night at a pizza place,
1934960	1936960	we were riding back to where we were staying
1936960	1938960	and the bus stopped.
1938960	1939960	I was like, why?
1939960	1940960	Why is the bus stopping?
1940960	1941960	And it turns out there was a bunny
1941960	1944960	in the middle of the road and it wouldn't move.
1944960	1947960	I couldn't understand why it wouldn't move.
1947960	1949960	Most people on the bus
1949960	1951960	understood the significance of this bunny
1951960	1953960	and this poor woman who went through something
1953960	1956960	that no parent should ever have to go through.
1956960	1960960	Most people on the bus realized the significance.
1960960	1964960	Almost everybody knew what was going on.
1964960	1966960	Some people just wanted to go back
1966960	1968960	to where we were staying.
1969960	1973960	Some people just all hopped up on root beer and pizza,
1973960	1975960	didn't really know what was going on,
1975960	1977960	why a bunny was stopping us.
1977960	1980960	Some people started to chant,
1980960	1983960	or maybe one person started to chant
1983960	1986960	or more like just yell,
1986960	1988960	Run it over!
1988960	1990960	Run it over!
1990960	1992960	Run it!
1992960	1996960	Oh, shit.
1996960	1999960	Do you think she heard me?
1999960	2000960	And I know we looked her in the eyes again.
2000960	2001960	That was the end of the day.
2001960	2002960	That was the worst thing I ever did.
2002960	2004960	So thank you very much, guys.
2004960	2005960	Whoo!
2005960	2008960	Ryan Sullivan, everybody!
2008960	2010960	Oh, don't forget, I'm racist for me.
2010960	2012960	Thank you, Ryan Sullivan.
2012960	2013960	Could be worse.
2013960	2015960	Ryan Sullivan, we'll talk about you after you.
2015960	2016960	Ryan Sullivan.
2016960	2018960	Ryan Sullivan, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2018960	2020960	Keep your eyes out for that kid.
2020960	2022960	You can sit in a VIP seat, Ryan.
2022960	2025960	Yeah, sit in a VIP booth if you want.
2026960	2027960	Spencer.
2027960	2028960	For a second, I was like,
2028960	2030960	oh, who's going to stop the music?
2030960	2032960	Then I realized.
2032960	2034960	Spencer, tell me my biggest flaw.
2034960	2036960	Take my fucking head off, man.
2036960	2037960	I can't, man.
2037960	2039960	You're like my hero.
2039960	2040960	My shoes?
2040960	2042960	Yeah, they're untied, bro.
2042960	2044960	I don't know.
2044960	2045960	That's your flaw.
2045960	2047960	Is that just the drunk lady in the back?
2047960	2048960	Okay, that's fine.
2048960	2051960	Can we talk about Ryan really quick?
2051960	2052960	You want to talk?
2052960	2054960	Yeah, that is my biggest flaw.
2054960	2056960	Can somebody top me off?
2056960	2059960	It's mass hysteria up here.
2059960	2063960	I need more ice first, but that's fine.
2063960	2065960	All right.
2065960	2069960	Death is the theme of tonight's show in Kansas City.
2069960	2075960	I really liked Ryan's Ryan Gosling joke.
2075960	2077960	Correct me if I'm wrong, audience,
2077960	2079960	but it seemed like you guys were really ready
2079960	2081960	to not like anything Ryan did.
2081960	2083960	No, that's not true.
2083960	2084960	They were.
2084960	2085960	No.
2085960	2086960	Oh, well, fine, fine.
2086960	2087960	That's good.
2087960	2089960	No, I expected bigger laughs.
2089960	2093960	Don't make us throw Ryan under the bus.
2093960	2095960	His Ryan Gosling joke worked,
2095960	2097960	and then it had too many tag lines,
2097960	2099960	and then he had that big, long conceptual thing
2099960	2100960	with the rabbit.
2100960	2101960	Okay, okay.
2101960	2102960	He lost us.
2102960	2105960	Ryan, I'm standing up here fucking crucified
2105960	2107960	on Golgoth, though.
2107960	2109960	I am not.
2109960	2112960	Do not let that hurt your feelings at all.
2112960	2114960	No, can we hear it again for Ryan?
2114960	2116960	That was very brave and great.
2116960	2119960	It was really great.
2119960	2120960	That's good.
2120960	2123960	That was really good.
2123960	2131960	It was weird that you attacked Ryan for his jokes, Erin.
2131960	2133960	That's not what I meant to do.
2133960	2135960	I wasn't meant to attack Ryan.
2135960	2136960	I misunderstood the audience.
2136960	2137960	I'm sorry.
2137960	2138960	It's these lights, guys.
2138960	2140960	I always felt most traumatized on the playground
2140960	2141960	whenever people would stick up for me.
2141960	2143960	That's always when I would start to cry.
2143960	2145960	I know you're my audience,
2145960	2146960	so I know some of you know what it's like
2146960	2149960	to get picked on on the playground.
2149960	2151960	It would never make me cry to get picked on.
2151960	2152960	People would bully me.
2152960	2155960	They'd give you face washes in the snow,
2155960	2156960	swirlies in the toilet,
2156960	2159960	and Melvin's in the hoo-ha.
2159960	2160960	Just punch you and ask you,
2160960	2161960	why don't you shower?
2161960	2163960	Why do you drop your pants all the way to the floor
2163960	2165960	when you take a pee at the urinal?
2165960	2167960	Why are there skid marks in your underwear
2167960	2168960	when you do that?
2168960	2169960	Why do you eat paste?
2169960	2171960	Why do you think a glue bottle is a rocket?
2171960	2175960	Why is your hair full of dandruff and grease
2175960	2176960	and sound erases?
2176960	2177960	Well, I understand.
2177960	2179960	Just to clarify, I wasn't sticking up for Ryan.
2179960	2182960	I just wanted to give him extra credit where he stood.
2182960	2183960	But then it would always be the people
2183960	2185960	that would come up in the midst of it
2185960	2187960	while somebody was picking on me,
2187960	2189960	because that would just make me gird my loins.
2189960	2191960	I would just go, okay, this is the way life is.
2191960	2192960	I'm going to put the shields up.
2192960	2193960	I'm going to be a porcupine.
2193960	2196960	I'm going to, like, this pain, I'll get numb to it.
2196960	2198960	And then some well-meaning fucker would come up
2198960	2200960	and go like, hey, leave him alone, man,
2200960	2202960	just because he's all fucked up
2202960	2205960	and dirty and greasy and shitty and doesn't fit in.
2205960	2209960	He doesn't have to be a normal person for you to like him, okay?
2209960	2210960	Maybe he's special.
2210960	2212960	Maybe he's so fucked up
2212960	2214960	that something really weird about him is good.
2214960	2216960	You don't know.
2216960	2219960	Maybe some really specific situation will happen,
2219960	2224960	like a flood of chemicals that only freaks can breathe.
2224960	2226960	Maybe bat creatures will attack
2227960	2229960	that have a weird-shaped face
2229960	2233960	that is vulnerable to fucking gross, stinky nerds.
2233960	2235960	And then he'll be a hero then.
2235960	2236960	And then I would always start crying,
2236960	2239960	because that's the guy that likes me,
2239960	2241960	like sticking up for me.
2241960	2243960	And then when I would start crying,
2243960	2246960	and then the nerd protector would go like,
2246960	2248960	come on, see, now he's crying.
2248960	2249960	You're a bad person.
2249960	2250960	Don't pick on people.
2250960	2252960	You shouldn't pick on people that are gross,
2252960	2253960	stinky, shitty nerds.
2253960	2255960	Well, Ryan, just so you know,
2255960	2256960	that's not what I was doing.
2256960	2258960	Now it's kind of what Dan's doing,
2258960	2260960	because he qualified it that way.
2260960	2264960	But I was just offering you more applause.
2264960	2267960	Ryan, you and I are fucking square.
2267960	2269960	Also, Aaron, I was just kidding.
2269960	2271960	I didn't think you were doing anything wrong.
2271960	2273960	Jesus Christ, have we learned one thing in Kansas City?
2273960	2278960	If not, that we all must go through a valley of darkness?
2278960	2280960	Beef?
2280960	2281960	Beef?
2281960	2282960	A valley of beef?
2282960	2284960	I've got VIPs up here now.
2284960	2285960	I can't remember which are which.
2285960	2288960	Yeah, can we check in with our Wallace and Gromit?
2288960	2289960	Tim.
2289960	2290960	Kyle.
2290960	2291960	Tim.
2291960	2292960	Ryan.
2292960	2293960	Kyle Ryan.
2293960	2296960	How come people can't be named like Banana?
2296960	2298960	Like Terrier.
2298960	2301960	How come you can't have a code name or something?
2301960	2302960	You know, like G.I. Joe.
2302960	2304960	If you had a flamethrower on your back,
2304960	2306960	your name was Barbecue, you know?
2306960	2309960	Like if you had skis, your name wasn't Christmas tree.
2309960	2311960	Dan, you have a rap about this, right?
2311960	2313960	Uh-huh, I guess.
2313960	2315960	G.I. Joe had really clear names.
2315960	2317960	He never had to tell men from Dames
2317960	2320960	who just looked at their hat, and that's what they were.
2320960	2322960	If they were fat, their name was Raymond Burr.
2322960	2324960	Terry Mason.
2324960	2325960	Fuck you.
2325960	2326960	Jarsa Kason.
2326960	2327960	Fuck you.
2327960	2329960	Keep thinking about April and Pat.
2329960	2332960	I fucked April, and then I fucked Pat.
2332960	2334960	Fuck Pat and made April watch.
2334960	2337960	You listening, April?
2337960	2342960	Fuckin' April, you unsupportive wife.
2342960	2346960	April, listen to me, April.
2346960	2348960	I do this shit for free, April.
2348960	2349960	No one charges for it.
2349960	2351960	Your husband came down here,
2351960	2353960	and you thought he was gonna have a bad time.
2353960	2357960	He's sitting in the fuckin' VIP slut booth.
2357960	2361960	Can we hear more about why she didn't like it?
2361960	2364960	He could get high-licking that tabletop.
2364960	2366960	That's where Tim Allen sits
2366960	2368960	when he comes down.
2368960	2370960	Like, you know that if you ran your finger
2370960	2372960	on the underside of that table and rubbed your gums,
2372960	2375960	you'd go in for dental surgery for half price.
2375960	2378960	He is in the VIP booth, April.
2378960	2381960	You drove him here. You drove him away.
2381960	2385960	If he comes home tonight, you're lucky.
2385960	2387960	And it's because he's a Harman Town listener
2387960	2390960	that he'll stay faithful to you, April.
2390960	2393960	Because he's a nerd, and he knows what it's like
2393960	2397960	to be like me and Ryan be unappreciated.
2397960	2400960	And so he's gonna have a moment of compassion
2400960	2403960	as all these fellow Harman Town fans.
2403960	2405960	And there's a lot of good-looking chicks out here
2405960	2407960	in the audience tonight.
2407960	2409960	And they're gonna be all over...
2409960	2412960	Is it Kyle? Okay.
2412960	2416960	Dan, that is an interesting phenomenon.
2416960	2418960	I talked to a few people before the show
2418960	2420960	who were either here with their partners
2420960	2422960	or had come without them who had said,
2422960	2424960	I tried to get my girlfriend to come, but she went to come,
2424960	2426960	or I tried to get my boyfriend to come.
2426960	2428960	Where do you stand on that? You and I...
2428960	2430960	It's kind of like the same things, but...
2430960	2432960	I would absolutely... I think it's a very supportive thing
2432960	2434960	to say, go ahead, go to the show,
2434960	2436960	but I'm not gonna go because it's not my cup of tea.
2436960	2438960	I think you're fine, April.
2438960	2441960	Your mom, also, I think is fine.
2441960	2443960	Let's call her who she is, Pat.
2443960	2445960	I think she's amazing.
2445960	2447960	Is there anyone in the audience
2447960	2450960	who has fallen in love over Harman Town?
2450960	2453960	Yeah, is anybody like...
2453960	2455960	It's wishful thinking.
2455960	2458960	The things that I received after that question.
2458960	2460960	Yeah, that's kind of fishing for something.
2460960	2462960	You can't blame yourself for...
2462960	2466960	All right, so let's get back to April's mom, Pat.
2466960	2470960	So where is Pat from?
2470960	2472960	Probably Missouri.
2472960	2474960	Central Missouri.
2474960	2477960	Right in the middle of fucking the Death Star.
2477960	2482960	That piece of shit state.
2482960	2486960	Show me. More like, don't show me.
2486960	2488960	I don't want to see it.
2488960	2491960	Keep that fridge door closed, Missouri.
2491960	2497960	How weird that your state is a barely mispronounced misery.
2497960	2499960	What a coincidence.
2499960	2501960	You sons of bitches.
2501960	2504960	Dan, one of our closest friends is from Missouri.
2504960	2506960	Who?
2506960	2509960	Kimber Hall, my closest friend, my roommate.
2509960	2511960	I'm just trying to get these guys on my side.
2511960	2513960	No, it's fine.
2513960	2515960	But you're uniting them via hatred.
2515960	2517960	I don't think they want that. They're smarter than that.
2517960	2519960	Play the country song.
2519960	2522960	I'm going to sing a country song about Missouri sucking.
2528960	2530960	All right.
2530960	2533960	Hip-stomp and a boo-boo-lop.
2533960	2537960	A doop-doop-doop-doop-doop.
2537960	2541960	Well, my name is John Missouri.
2541960	2544960	I'm a shit-eating son of a fucker.
2544960	2549960	I went to my house and never hoped for supper.
2549960	2552960	Because I eat dogs and dirt and cigarettes.
2552960	2555960	And I wear peanut butter for a hat.
2555960	2558960	I'm a big dumb fucking asshole piece of shit.
2558960	2562960	And my wife's name is Pat.
2563960	2566960	I'm Kyle's father.
2568960	2571960	Hold on. I'm sorry. I lost my place.
2571960	2575960	Sorry, deep-dop, deep-dop, a-doop-a-dop-do.
2575960	2577960	Here we go. Second verse.
2577960	2579960	I'm Kyle's father.
2579960	2583960	My wife's name is Pat.
2583960	2586960	I gave birth to Kyle.
2586960	2588960	My good effects stopped at that.
2588960	2591960	I've never done anything good.
2591960	2594960	I live in a pile of leaves.
2594960	2595960	Yeah.
2595960	2598960	I'm a big piece of fucking shit.
2598960	2601960	I'm from Missouri.
2601960	2605960	It's got no right to have half a Kansas City.
2605960	2609960	Just leave your garbage on the lawn.
2610960	2614960	I got three feet and half a hand.
2614960	2618960	I got Russell Brand on the TiVo.
2619960	2622960	Because I like his style.
2622960	2627960	I'm a big piece of fucking motherfucking shit from Missouri.
2627960	2630960	I hate Missouri.
2630960	2632960	I mean, I love it, and I'm a piece of shit.
2632960	2633960	Sorry, I got it.
2633960	2635960	All right.
2635960	2636960	All right.
2636960	2639960	We can do anything together now.
2639960	2644960	It's almost time for D&D, but I am so curious to hear from somebody who's a...
2644960	2645960	From Missouri?
2645960	2646960	Hardcore Kansas, loyal...
2646960	2647960	Well, both.
2647960	2648960	Are you from Missouri, sir?
2648960	2650960	I just want someone to say what they hate about Missouri.
2650960	2651960	No, no, no, no.
2651960	2652960	We have better.
2652960	2653960	We have a Missouri...
2653960	2654960	Are you willing to come up?
2654960	2656960	Please, no one kill him after show.
2656960	2657960	No, no.
2657960	2658960	Nobody's going to kill him.
2658960	2661960	Oh, thank you.
2661960	2662960	Thank you.
2662960	2665960	I know Amanda is one of the servers.
2665960	2667960	Is that you?
2667960	2668960	Oh, okay.
2668960	2672960	I have face blindness, and you changed your hair before the show.
2672960	2675960	Amanda and the other servers, don't forget to tip them.
2676960	2681960	Sometimes, believe it or not, people forget to do that.
2681960	2686960	It also seems weird that people would forget.
2686960	2689960	You always hear people say don't forget, so they must forget occasionally.
2689960	2691960	I'm basing it on that alone.
2691960	2692960	Hello, sir.
2692960	2693960	What's your name?
2693960	2694960	Darren.
2694960	2697960	Darren, the human being from Missouri.
2697960	2698960	He's a human being.
2698960	2699960	How dare you?
2699960	2700960	Don't boo him.
2700960	2701960	Don't in both.
2701960	2704960	Actually, the song that you sang was fairly accurate.
2705960	2708960	See, he's a self-loathing.
2708960	2710960	His pulse beats.
2710960	2712960	It's Darren.
2712960	2713960	Yeah, Darren.
2713960	2715960	Darren, we have the same name.
2715960	2718960	Why does everyone pick on you on Missouri?
2718960	2719960	I don't get it.
2719960	2721960	I think it's because we have a better baseball team.
2721960	2723960	Is it the same thing in Missouri?
2723960	2725960	Do you guys pick on Kansas?
2725960	2728960	Yeah, well, yeah, we're on one side of Missouri.
2728960	2729960	They're on the other side.
2729960	2730960	What divides you?
2730960	2731960	Is it a river?
2731960	2735960	I mean, I know it's hatred, but is there a river between...
2735960	2736960	What's that?
2736960	2737960	A river of hate.
2737960	2738960	A river of hate, okay.
2738960	2739960	I thought you said river of paint.
2739960	2740960	It was like, okay, wait.
2740960	2742960	Is that like an industrial thing?
2742960	2743960	This fucker's from Missouri.
2743960	2748960	They make paint, and then they put it into the river.
2748960	2749960	You tell me.
2749960	2751960	So it's a geologically, geographically it's a river
2751960	2753960	that separates the two parts of the city?
2753960	2754960	Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
2754960	2756960	I don't understand why they're both the same city then.
2756960	2758960	They're saying the same thing.
2758960	2759960	What the hell happened?
2759960	2761960	What is going on?
2761960	2762960	I have no idea.
2762960	2766960	I failed geography in a minute, so...
2766960	2767960	I'm the wrong person to ask about that.
2767960	2768960	All right, well, I don't...
2768960	2771960	Okay, I'm not gonna get any answers here tonight.
2771960	2772960	We should just stick with him.
2772960	2774960	I need a second place.
2774960	2776960	All right.
2776960	2779960	Somebody's calling out something that's sports related.
2779960	2780960	Hey, Aaron, let's do a...
2780960	2781960	No, he's...
2781960	2782960	Oh, no, no, it's okay.
2782960	2783960	Thank you for coming.
2783960	2785960	He's excusing himself off the stage.
2785960	2786960	Oh, Darren's excusing himself.
2786960	2787960	Well, Darren, did you...
2787960	2788960	Wait, Darren.
2788960	2789960	Darren, wait.
2789960	2790960	We can't let you go right away.
2790960	2794960	This is how thick this conflict is.
2794960	2797960	I want to know from Darren what his...
2797960	2799960	What is your...
2799960	2801960	Can you tell us like a wish that you have,
2801960	2803960	a big ambition or anything like that?
2803960	2806960	I wanted to hear a second season
2806960	2810960	of the werewolf teenager show.
2810960	2812960	That we did in Charlotte, yeah.
2812960	2815960	All right, well, beat that, you Missouri fucker.
2815960	2817960	That's not gonna make any sense.
2818960	2820960	What's a personal wish of yours,
2820960	2822960	besides Missouri and Kansas getting along?
2822960	2825960	Besides fucking Pat, which all of us...
2825960	2827960	We all want to do that.
2827960	2829960	Are you listening, April?
2831960	2834960	Yeah, I really... I have none, so...
2834960	2835960	Oh, Jesus.
2835960	2837960	I'm a fairly happy person.
2837960	2841960	Darren, is there anyone who you love who has a dream?
2841960	2843960	Libby Huey over there has a dream.
2843960	2845960	Yeah, which was her dream?
2845960	2847960	What's Libby's dream?
2847960	2849960	I think she wants to be a musician.
2849960	2851960	We've been dating for five years,
2851960	2853960	and I literally know nothing about her.
2853960	2855960	All right, let's thank Darren,
2855960	2857960	and we're gonna do a quick movie for Darren.
2857960	2860960	We're gonna create a movie for him.
2860960	2862960	Darren, I want you to play Libby Huey
2862960	2865960	in the Darren and Libby story
2865960	2867960	about two star-crossed lovers
2867960	2869960	from different sides of Kansas City.
2869960	2871960	I'd like you to play Darren.
2871960	2877960	Bling, bling, bling, bling.
2877960	2882960	A tale of two sides of the same city.
2886960	2892960	What's that sound from outside my shitty Missouri apartment?
2892960	2895960	I'm gonna go out and check it out.
2895960	2899960	Ooh, it almost fell in the river that's right outside my door.
2900960	2902960	Excuse me, young lady.
2903960	2905960	I'm sorry, I'm just Darren.
2905960	2908960	I was just in my apartment just wanting nothing,
2908960	2913960	and I couldn't help but overhear this sound.
2913960	2915960	What's going on?
2915960	2917960	I'm playing the guitar.
2917960	2919960	Oh, a musician?
2919960	2922960	Well, I want to be.
2922960	2924960	I'd love to hear some more,
2924960	2928960	but this damn river lies between us.
2929960	2932960	Would you meet me at the bridge
2932960	2937960	where there's that dinosaur cafe?
2937960	2939960	In Kansas City?
2939960	2942960	Well, what if we met right in the middle of the bridge?
2942960	2946960	Neither of us were in either part of the city?
2946960	2948960	All right, I can do that.
2948960	2950960	Just don't speak too loudly or my family will kill me
2950960	2952960	and cut out my brain.
2952960	2955960	Okay, three hours later...
2960960	2963960	I'm not sure how it works.
2963960	2966960	Here we are in the middle of the bridge.
2970960	2972960	Hey.
2972960	2975960	I never touched a Kansas City girl's face.
2978960	2980960	I'm in a Kansas girl's face.
2980960	2982960	We're both from Kansas City.
2982960	2984960	I don't know if you can.
2984960	2988960	My family told me that if a Missourian ever touched my face
2988960	2991960	skin would melt and turn into an army of Nazis
2991960	2994960	that would destroy the planet.
2994960	2999960	Can I touch you?
2999960	3003960	Yes, I can, sis.
3005960	3010960	Should I feel you?
3010960	3014960	Yes, I should.
3014960	3017960	A Missouri.
3017960	3024960	When you smile, and I smile.
3024960	3029960	When you laugh, and I laugh.
3032960	3037960	Missouri, Kansas,
3037960	3041960	Kansas,
3041960	3043960	Kansas,
3049960	3051960	This is the sickest of the police.
3051960	3053960	You are in violation of the non-miscegenation treaty
3053960	3055960	between Kansas and Missouri.
3055960	3059960	Please stop interbreeding with that inferior Missouri woman
3059960	3061960	and get back to your home.
3061960	3063960	Or, shit, a Kansas person.
3063960	3064960	I'm sorry, I'm a helicopter pilot.
3064960	3068960	I'm confused, because I often cross between things.
3068960	3071960	I'll explain later, but just know that you guys
3071960	3073960	are forbidden to do what you're doing.
3073960	3077960	Run! Run! We have to go to Omaha.
3079960	3084960	Go through this sewer. It'll take us straight there.
3084960	3089960	Oh, God. Oh, shit, Omaha.
3089960	3092960	Where everything is mutual.
3095960	3098960	I kind of set myself up there, didn't I?
3098960	3102960	Hey, I should let you know now. I have five years in me.
3102960	3104960	What does that mean?
3104960	3107960	Look, there was a prophecy. I read it on a plate
3107960	3110960	when I was 15 years old that said that I would meet a man
3110960	3112960	from the other side of the river.
3112960	3114960	We would start dating, and then we would stop
3114960	3117960	after five years, and we would go to a comedy show,
3118960	3121960	and then one of us would eat the other's face.
3123960	3124960	Five years from now?
3124960	3126960	It was a long plate.
3127960	3129960	Yes, five years from now.
3129960	3132960	Libby, I wouldn't eat your face.
3132960	3135960	Really? But what if I ate your face?
3138960	3144960	What if I ate your face?
3145960	3151960	Put your blood out of place.
3153960	3157960	You would
3165960	3168960	milk
3168960	3171960	milk.
3171960	3173960	Were you going to say me?
3173960	3175960	I was going to say milk.
3175960	3177960	You're fucking weird.
3177960	3180960	I can't do this relationship anymore.
3180960	3182960	Open up in there.
3182960	3186960	It's the international Omaha police department.
3186960	3188960	We know you're in there.
3188960	3192960	Intermingling with Kansas and Missouri people.
3192960	3195960	We're coming in with our special futuristic Omaha
3195960	3198960	bathroom rams.
3198960	3201960	Put them on laser setting.
3201960	3203960	I don't even know who this bitch is.
3203960	3206960	I'm out of here.
3206960	3210960	20 years later, in Kansas City maximum security
3210960	3214960	future prison,
3216960	3219960	Libby, I've got good news.
3219960	3220960	You're up for parole.
3220960	3222960	Oh, you gave birth.
3223960	3226960	No, this is Sarah's.
3226960	3229960	Sarah has...
3229960	3232960	No, I didn't give birth because I've been without my
3232960	3235960	one true love this whole time, but thanks for rubbing it in.
3235960	3238960	Well, you've got a big awakening in for you.
3238960	3241960	You know that in the time you've been incarcerated,
3241960	3243960	the laws have changed.
3243960	3244960	The rivers dried up.
3244960	3246960	The laws can never change.
3246960	3247960	There's no more river, Libby.
3247960	3248960	Kansas and Missouri can never get a law.
3248960	3250960	There's no more river.
3250960	3251960	It's gone.
3251960	3252960	There's no more water.
3252960	3253960	There's no more river.
3253960	3255960	All the cities are united now.
3255960	3259960	East and west, New Hampshire.
3259960	3262960	St. Louis and Minneapolis are the same thing now.
3262960	3265960	It's called St. Louis.
3265960	3267960	You geography genius.
3267960	3269960	Thank you for letting me know.
3269960	3273960	I say go out there and go to that man that betrayed you
3273960	3275960	and left you.
3275960	3277960	Because it seems like an ending.
3277960	3279960	Maybe not a good one.
3279960	3281960	All right, I'm going to find him.
3281960	3287960	You never close your eyes when I crawl through weeds
3287960	3290960	and jump over fences.
3290960	3293960	Ian?
3293960	3294960	Darren.
3294960	3295960	Darren.
3295960	3296960	Darren.
3296960	3298960	I'm behind you.
3298960	3299960	What?
3299960	3302960	No one's behind or in front of anyone anymore.
3302960	3305960	It's post-riverdom.
3305960	3308960	I've been behind you the whole time.
3308960	3310960	I went to prison too.
3310960	3311960	You did?
3311960	3313960	I was your parole officer.
3313960	3316960	Well, that's fucked up.
3316960	3318960	Why didn't you say something?
3318960	3320960	I didn't want you to get mad at me for taking a job
3320960	3322960	at the place where you were imprisoned.
3322960	3324960	I always knew that you loved me as someone
3324960	3326960	who didn't want to do anything.
3326960	3328960	I got you this guitar.
3328960	3330960	It's made of shoes and...
3330960	3332960	Shoes!
3332960	3333960	Corn.
3333960	3337960	I love shoes, so I'll forget everything you just said.
3338960	3347960	I just want to have a happy ending
3347960	3350960	in here's guest room.
3350960	3358960	I'll say that because Missouri
3358960	3369960	and Kansas are the same.
3369960	3373960	Oh, Erin McGathey, what a great movie.
3373960	3376960	See, you guys understand, right?
3376960	3378960	You get it.
3378960	3379960	Yeah.
3379960	3382960	Spencer, how did you feel about that?
3382960	3386960	It was good, but I liked your lyrics.
3387960	3389960	There was a deleted scene in that movie
3389960	3394960	where Kyle's wife's April's mother's pat
3394960	3398960	took like a million dicks in her face.
3398960	3400960	You hear that, April?
3400960	3404960	Your mother had to be cut out of the movie
3404960	3408960	because it was too dirty when she was in it.
3408960	3410960	No, but be fair, she only took a million dicks
3410960	3413960	because she already has a million dicks.
3413960	3416960	They wanted friends for her dicks already.
3416960	3418960	The owner of the club was giving us the light
3418960	3421960	and I automatically assumed it was like a camcorder.
3421960	3423960	I was like, oh, the show's going better.
3423960	3425960	He's taping us.
3425960	3429960	I automatically assume it's time for Dungeons & Dragons!
3435960	3439960	All right, when we last met, our heroes...
3439960	3440960	Jesus, are you okay?
3440960	3442960	Yeah, you don't give me any time to set up beforehand.
3442960	3445960	You just randomly cue me and start the music.
3445960	3447960	Hey, do you see me dying up here, motherfucker?
3447960	3448960	Well, you could have said something.
3448960	3450960	We're fighting. You and I are fighting.
3450960	3451960	You want to fight right now?
3451960	3452960	Yeah.
3452960	3454960	I don't think we should play Dungeons & Dragons.
3454960	3457960	Whoa!
3457960	3458960	I'm sorry, Spencer.
3458960	3460960	Now we've made up and we've atoned.
3460960	3463960	There, my sense of story structure is appeased.
3463960	3464960	That's it? That's all we need?
3464960	3465960	Yeah, yeah.
3465960	3466960	Sometimes that's all it is.
3466960	3467960	It's a shitty movie.
3467960	3469960	Last time we met, our heroes had been journeying
3469960	3471960	in the belly of the beast.
3472960	3474960	No, I don't think that's it.
3474960	3475960	Okay, all right.
3475960	3476960	I think...
3476960	3477960	I've got to say something.
3477960	3478960	Should I keep going, guys?
3478960	3480960	No, I have something to say.
3480960	3481960	Yeah.
3481960	3483960	Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden.
3483960	3487960	You know, Spencer and I have been doing merch
3487960	3488960	this whole time.
3488960	3489960	Yeah.
3489960	3491960	And Spencer's been very thoughtful
3491960	3495960	and very kind and very attentive.
3495960	3497960	What do you mean attentive?
3497960	3499960	I just mean he's sensitive to the way I feel
3499960	3501960	and he really sees me.
3501960	3504960	Like, he really sees, like, your crotch and stuff?
3506960	3508960	No, not yet.
3508960	3509960	I mean, I just...
3509960	3510960	What?
3510960	3512960	This is crazy.
3512960	3517960	I'm just saying he's very kind and sensitive
3517960	3521960	and, you know, you've been a bit of a bully.
3521960	3522960	Yeah.
3522960	3525960	And I think that maybe over the course of this trip,
3525960	3528960	Spencer and I have become close.
3528960	3529960	All right.
3529960	3530960	Well, that's fine.
3530960	3531960	Can I...
3531960	3532960	We only have, like, six minutes left.
3532960	3533960	Yeah.
3533960	3534960	Okay, all right.
3534960	3535960	Pause.
3535960	3536960	JK.
3536960	3537960	All right, here we go.
3537960	3538960	I don't even know.
3538960	3539960	You guys are in a fish.
3539960	3540960	All right.
3540960	3541960	Do you have our character sheets?
3541960	3543960	You rejoined and entered a large cavity
3543960	3545960	after fighting a mucusy spider slime
3545960	3548960	and several spindly-limbed lightning creatures.
3548960	3549960	You defeated them.
3549960	3551960	You were left alone.
3552960	3553960	So that's where you guys are.
3553960	3554960	All right.
3554960	3556960	Do you want characters right now?
3556960	3557960	Should we just go?
3557960	3558960	Like, we could just go.
3558960	3559960	Let's just go freestyle.
3559960	3560960	Yeah, freestyle it.
3560960	3561960	All right.
3561960	3562960	If there's a spell I should cast, tell me.
3562960	3563960	Okay.
3563960	3564960	Roll of a thousand dicks.
3564960	3566960	So what did you...
3566960	3568960	That just sounds deadly.
3568960	3569960	What did you say, Ian?
3569960	3570960	He said roll of a thousand dicks.
3570960	3572960	Earlier, like, you were talking about, like,
3572960	3574960	a thousand dicks with Pat.
3574960	3575960	Oh, yeah, Pat, yeah.
3575960	3576960	In her face.
3576960	3577960	If there were a thousand dicks involved,
3577960	3578960	I was definitely talking about Pat.
3578960	3579960	Yeah, April's mom.
3579960	3580960	Yeah.
3580960	3581960	And all the dicks, like,
3581960	3583960	how would Spencer react to that?
3583960	3585960	Oh, yeah, well, I mean, honestly,
3585960	3586960	now we have two minutes left.
3586960	3587960	Okay.
3587960	3588960	That's all right.
3588960	3589960	Just go smoke a cigarette.
3589960	3591960	You're killing us.
3591960	3592960	Oh, no, no.
3592960	3593960	No, don't really.
3593960	3594960	Don't really.
3594960	3595960	He relaxes.
3595960	3596960	He put so much work into that.
3596960	3597960	I quit eight years ago.
3597960	3598960	I was smoking two packs a day.
3598960	3600960	I don't even fucking think about it.
3600960	3601960	It gets so easy.
3601960	3602960	He really doesn't.
3602960	3603960	I've never seen him.
3603960	3604960	It gets so easy.
3604960	3605960	Don't worry about it.
3605960	3606960	All right.
3606960	3608960	If you recall, you killed those things.
3608960	3609960	You're now in a lung.
3609960	3610960	And you started...
3610960	3612960	You set some smoke to make it cough.
3612960	3613960	All right.
3613960	3614960	All right.
3614960	3615960	So now we're, like, what?
3615960	3616960	We're, like, almost out of the fish or...
3616960	3617960	The lung spasming.
3617960	3618960	All right.
3618960	3619960	All right.
3619960	3621960	We wait as the lung spasms.
3621960	3624960	It spasms so violently, it threatens to shake apart.
3624960	3627960	You get the sensation that if you would only breach its membrane,
3627960	3630960	it could be torn asunder very quickly.
3632960	3633960	I agree.
3633960	3635960	What did she say?
3635960	3636960	I don't know.
3636960	3637960	I just agree.
3637960	3638960	You're just agreeing for that.
3638960	3639960	Yeah, because we don't have time to disagree.
3639960	3640960	Yeah.
3641960	3642960	Oh, man.
3642960	3645960	There's a very pretty drunk girl.
3645960	3646960	Very happy lady.
3646960	3647960	She's enjoying it.
3647960	3648960	It's a good show.
3648960	3649960	Yeah, she had a good time.
3649960	3650960	Yeah.
3650960	3651960	A nice time.
3651960	3653960	Stick around for all the comics that are going on next,
3653960	3655960	that are sitting next to you.
3655960	3656960	It'll be great.
3656960	3657960	All right.
3657960	3658960	The...
3658960	3662960	We breach the membrane, whatever you said that we get the sense we could do.
3662960	3663960	Okay.
3663960	3665960	Well, do you have a sword?
3665960	3666960	You don't have a sword.
3666960	3667960	Do you have a knife?
3667960	3671960	I tell Quark to do it with his fire sword.
3671960	3672960	All right.
3672960	3673960	I got this sword.
3673960	3674960	Let me just slice through.
3674960	3679960	He pulls out his sword and making a couple slices across the belly of the membrane
3679960	3681960	that you guys are currently in.
3681960	3683960	It slashes open and the smoke pours out.
3683960	3687960	You feel the entire creature you're surrounded by give a violent shudder
3687960	3689960	as if it was hurt or wounded.
3689960	3693960	And then you feel yourself drop in the sky as if the entire thing had fell down
3693960	3696960	a couple hundred yards before regaining traction.
3696960	3697960	Oh, shit.
3697960	3700960	You've definitely done something, but it's not dead yet.
3700960	3701960	Okay.
3701960	3703960	Well, probably good because we don't want to die with it.
3703960	3704960	Ha!
3704960	3705960	Oh, we don't want to die with it.
3705960	3706960	Well, yeah.
3706960	3709960	We don't want to plummet to earth and explode with us in it.
3709960	3714960	Giving a final violent shudder, the entire lung you're inside of falls apart
3714960	3717960	and you fall down about 50 feet
3717960	3720960	until you land on a pillowy cushion back in the room you were in before.
3720960	3721960	Oh, nice.
3721960	3722960	Convenient.
3722960	3723960	It's like a video game.
3723960	3724960	Yeah.
3724960	3725960	All right.
3726960	3728960	Can we see that village from here?
3728960	3729960	The things?
3729960	3731960	You can see you're in a green room.
3731960	3732960	There's three holes.
3732960	3734960	One of them you just came through.
3734960	3735960	The other two you haven't been through.
3735960	3739960	Back behind you is a small purple door that leads back towards the village.
3739960	3740960	Right.
3740960	3741960	All right.
3741960	3742960	We've got to go through each of these.
3742960	3743960	Absolutely.
3743960	3744960	Yeah.
3744960	3747960	I mean, I really don't want to pay you more attention because I feel like I'm
3747960	3748960	doing you a favor.
3748960	3749960	Have you taken acid tonight?
3749960	3750960	Because this would be a trip.
3750960	3754960	There's a woman in the audience who said, have you ever taken acid before?
3754960	3755960	I have.
3755960	3756960	I have taken acid in mushrooms.
3756960	3762960	I haven't done heroin or ayahuasca.
3762960	3766960	But a fan gave us a jar of ayahuasca at the show.
3766960	3771960	And we should go take it now in the tour bus and finish this evening.
3771960	3772960	All right.
3772960	3773960	We've dropped 50 feet.
3773960	3776960	Well, not to – you guys have been great.
3776960	3777960	Thank you for coming to the show.
3777960	3778960	Yeah.
3778960	3779960	You've been amazing.
3779960	3780960	But it's 7-10.
3780960	3781960	We've got to be off the stage in five minutes.
3781960	3783960	So I don't – we should – let's just wrap up the Dungeons and Dragons.
3783960	3786960	You decide that you're going to go somewhere else.
3786960	3789960	I roll over on top of Sharpie.
3789960	3790960	Okay.
3790960	3791960	Nice.
3791960	3792960	Good.
3792960	3793960	That's very nice, isn't it?
3793960	3794960	All right.
3794960	3796960	Spencer, everybody, thank him for that wonderful –
3796960	3797960	Thank you, Spencer.
3797960	3804960	Sometimes Dungeons and Dragons doesn't last that long.
3804960	3807960	Hey, Dan.
3807960	3813960	So this show is probably a pivotal – pivotal –
3813960	3814960	Yeah.
3814960	3815960	Are you drunk, too?
3815960	3816960	Super.
3816960	3817960	Okay.
3817960	3821960	SCC second sectionals.
3821960	3822960	Isn't that –
3822960	3825960	Is that like – is that your cheerleading troupe or is that –
3825960	3828960	what are you – are you just cheering for a team of yours?
3828960	3830960	She doesn't know you're talking to her.
3830960	3831960	Okay.
3831960	3832960	That's fine.
3832960	3834960	You're a fire hydrant to her and vice versa.
3834960	3835960	That's fine.
3835960	3836960	That's fine.
3836960	3841960	Dan, this is a – this is an important moment in the – in your story circle.
3841960	3842960	Right.
3842960	3844960	This is – this is what?
3844960	3846960	The death?
3846960	3848960	Perhaps.
3848960	3849960	Do you want to queue up to –
3849960	3851960	But maybe it requires some – yeah, that's what I'm doing.
3851960	3852960	Right, right.
3852960	3854960	Yeah, what have we learned in Kansas City?
3854960	3858960	Ooh.
3858960	3859960	Ian, take it easy.
3859960	3861960	Just don't smoke.
3861960	3865960	Libby, keep loving your gross Missouri man.
3866960	3868960	And your gross misery man.
3868960	3872960	Drunk lady, keep drinking.
3872960	3875960	I've seen a beautiful city.
3875960	3879960	Its name was Kansas City.
3879960	3883960	As soft and creamy as a titty for me.
3883960	3886960	In misogyny town.
3886960	3889960	Man, I'm sorry if I sucked.
3889960	3891960	But really, who gives a fuck?
3892960	3896960	The room kind of looks like a place that you'd go to.
3896960	3899960	Fill out a customer survey about crackers.
3902960	3909960	In a shopping mall in Hama town.
3910960	3912960	The poop is brown.
3912960	3913960	I fucked your mama.
3913960	3915960	I fucked her good.
3915960	3918960	I fucked your mama and she turned to wood.
3918960	3923960	I shaped her into a tree and her leaves touched the sky.
3923960	3926960	And then I fucked her eye.
3926960	3929960	And she went blind.
3929960	3934960	And when she couldn't see, I told her about color.
3934960	3938960	And what I told her made her think twice.
3938960	3940960	No more race.
3940960	3943960	I fucked your mama and fixed her brain.
3943960	3947960	I fucked your mama in the rain.
3947960	3950960	I fucked your mama down the street.
3950960	3953960	I fucked your mama with my podcast meet.
3953960	3956960	And every town that I go to now,
3956960	3960960	I'm going to tell them about your mama and fuck her like cows.
3960960	3964960	It's got a reflection of who you are.
3964960	3967960	You should all get a brand new car.
3967960	3971960	You get a car, you get a car.
3971960	3973960	You also get a car.
3973960	3976960	Everybody that looks under their seat and finds gum
3976960	3977960	gets a car.
3977960	3978960	Just don't ask us about it.
3978960	3981960	Ask the manager of the club and we'll be gone.
3981960	3984960	We'll be on the front lawn.
3984960	3987960	We'll be going till the break of dawn.
3987960	3990960	If you bought stuff, I'll sign it over there.
3990960	3992960	That's the way you go.
3992960	3994960	Don't go down those stairs
3994960	3997960	because that's the next audience for the next show.
3997960	3998960	They'll beat you up.
3998960	4002960	I think we already know that my audience is nerds
4002960	4006960	and everyone out there is stronger and better
4006960	4010960	and has more money for these booths in the front.
4010960	4014960	And April, you're a concert.
4014960	4016960	Oh, no, he's such a heady.
4016960	4019960	Put it in the British sense.
4019960	4021960	In the British sense.
4021960	4023960	They use that word.
4023960	4024960	Okay.
4024960	4025960	Yo.
4025960	4026960	Hey, everybody.
4026960	4028960	Thank you for coming back home in town.
4028960	4030960	You have all been great mostly.
4030960	4031960	It's been awesome.
4031960	4032960	You guys are wonderful.
4032960	4034960	Please say hi after the show.
4034960	4035960	Yeah.
4035960	4036960	Yeah.
4036960	4038960	Fuck your mama and I'll see you later.
4038960	4040960	Fuck your mama like an alligator.
4040960	4044960	Go out the back and tip your waitstaff.
4044960	4047960	Fuck your mama so hard she was a giraffe.
4047960	4051960	I made her neck so long she couldn't handle it.
4051960	4054960	I fucked your mama like a candle got lit.
4054960	4057960	Lit in the back saying get off the stage
4057960	4058960	giving us a heart attack.
4058960	4060960	We've got to clean off the tables.
4060960	4062960	Got to get the shit out.
4062960	4063960	Got to go.
4063960	4065960	Got to fuck your mouth.
4065960	4068960	He's here for Kyle and Tim.
4068960	4069960	Kyle, everybody.
4069960	4071960	Ryan for doing his Tim.

4075960	4076960	Tim.
4076960	4077960	Everybody.
4077960	4078960	Tim, yeah.
4078960	4080960	Come on down to Harmon's house.
4080960	4081960	Ian for quitting smoking.
4081960	4083960	Turn your frown upside down.
4083960	4084960	Libby and Darren.
4084960	4086960	He's yelling for his frown.
4087960	4089960	Come on down to Harmon's house.
4089960	4091960	Yo, you got to settle your bills.
4091960	4093960	You got to eat all your hot wings.
4093960	4094960	I hope you got your fill.
4094960	4097960	I'll thank Aaron McGathey and Spencer the DM.
4097960	4101960	I fucked your mama so hard she stopped peeing.
4101960	4103960	I gave her a UTI, jammed her up.
4103960	4107960	Fucked your mama so hard she turned into a Labrador pup.
4107960	4109960	Changed her fur.
4109960	4110960	Changed her face.
4110960	4111960	Changed her species.
4111960	4113960	Changed her race.
4113960	4114960	See you in back.
