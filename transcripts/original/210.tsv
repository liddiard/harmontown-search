0	21000	I'm sorry for the delay, it's my fault. I don't know, there might be a word for this,
21000	27320	it's an Uber thing. I filled out the Uber thing, but I didn't hit the request button.
27320	33760	I put it back in my pocket. I hate to advertise for Uber, but it's become such a big part
33760	37680	of my life and it's so convenient that I didn't notice that I didn't do it all the
37680	44880	way. And then I looked at 745, I pulled out the phone and it was like, yeah, anytime you
44880	50600	want to say that you want someone to start thinking about picking you up, it's fine.
50600	57960	And I was like, Harmon, not a good way to start the show, especially when you're going
57960	64040	to start it late. You don't come out with a dumb boring story of why you're late. Don't
64040	76160	do that. The crowd will turn on you. They'll turn on you. Thank you, thank you. Said he
76160	83400	loved me. Choking, why are we ashamed to do it? We've talked about that. You start chocking
83400	87000	up food, your first instinct, I got to get out of here. I got to get out of this restaurant.
87000	91160	People are going to see me choking. When did we talk about this? I just imagine we did
91160	96200	because it's like, it seems like we would have. I mean, it is embarrassing to choke
96200	100520	because you're saying, look at me failing at the only thing we're designed to do as
100520	106140	humans. That was Cody's theory, but I wanted to add to that. I think it's also like, our
106140	114780	throats are reverse buttholes. They're private to us. It's glottal and gooey. That's the
114780	122420	threshold before we consider this to be stinky, gross factory of violence and everything we're
122420	128860	ashamed of. On a deep level, we have body shame. We all worry about, I mean, there's
128860	133260	a couple of us that don't worry about it, but getting our clothes suddenly ripped off
133260	139700	and our body being laid bare. We think about that as being a shame, but we don't even
139700	145020	have a word for the level of shame we have about our actual intestines. Saving Private
145020	148520	Ryan when the people are walking around and they're like, oh God. They're like, I'm so
148520	154700	embarrassed about this because they don't feel the pain yet. The pain is not an issue.
154700	160460	They're right there and they're feeling like, my arm is off. They're going, I look like
160460	165820	a dick to myself. No one else is going, what a dick, but it's what we feel and so when
165820	172420	you're choking, I mean, I swear to God. Do you think there's something about sphincters
172420	178860	that make us shameful inherently? Wait, about what? Sphincters. Oh, sphincters. You're saying
178860	184260	we're embarrassed of our throat buttholes. Yeah, I think that if you present a human
184260	190340	being or any biological organism with an image of a thing that has a sphincter on it, which
190340	198100	is a spot where it's a spot in a membrane or a case where things come to an elastic
198100	208740	but snug airtight. It sure is, Dan. I think we side with everything inside the sphincter
208740	217780	but we also, we are ashamed of it. The inside of anything that's sealed off from the outside
217780	224340	world represents us shamefully. When push comes to shove, we side with the sphincter.
224340	232700	Yeah, sphincter's a threshold. We side with the dark side of the sphincter. Right. With
232700	244500	all the shit, sir, yes. Jesus, this audience. All right. So Andy Dick is rescheduled. Yeah.
244500	248380	And I only mentioned that because of the appropriateness of it, he and Dino will be
248380	258940	back on September 11th. And I think it's okay to say this, but I don't even know which week
258940	263100	so you'll just have to keep coming to the show. We got some of those duffer brothers
263100	268660	coming today. Yeah, yeah. But we only got, a lot of people don't know this, there's nine
268660	275140	duff brothers. There's three duffer, three of the duffer ones of the nine are the ones
275140	281980	that make the show that you like. But there's two duffest brothers that they're so duff they
281980	286940	don't even work in entertainment. Like they're, they're just relaxed. Those are the people
286940	294140	you want on your show. But we got, we got, we got some duffer brothers. There's weed
294140	304300	oil lube. I don't know. That you can put on your, I guess you can put it on your privates
304300	320300	and. All right. We'll just talk about Trump all night, I guess. Who ironically hates children.
320300	328620	He hates children. All right. Well, and so, oh, oh, oh, oh, Obama. He's going to visit
328620	337180	the flood zone. Oh shit. Didn't they tell him not to? Oh shit. Thank you. Is it kind
337180	340820	of funny when you're the president, you have to visit the disasters. It's kind of, it's,
340820	346900	I realized what would happen if you didn't, and sometimes they don't. But it's funny,
346900	351380	just the idea of being a president and visiting a disaster is funny. It's hilarious. Because
351380	356700	it's like, because he's like show, he's, I mean, he, you know, we need, no, you know,
356700	362980	what's he going to do? He's just like, yup. I mean, I understand it's a symbolic thing.
362980	366860	It's like, it's, it's, do you want it to happen? But it is also still funny from a logical
366860	370620	perspective. It's like, it's very silly. He's just like, here he is. It's like, here, here
370620	375820	it is. So all the water, from where it was to where it shouldn't be. He gets off the
375820	380860	plane and is like, whoa. Yeah. That's fucked up. You guys are fucked up. Yeah, that's fucked
380860	386540	up. And I like, and then I'll make a speech and I'll go, I talked to Carl whose house
386540	398380	was inundated with water. Carl will be like, thank you for mentioning it. This is, yeah,
398380	402900	you can't make those up at a flood, at a flood speech. No, you gotta, you gotta, he's, he's
402900	408380	doing research. He's going to get the personal stories. Hello. Did you get flooded? Yes,
408380	421740	Mr. President. Okay. What's your name? Tara. T-A-R-A. Yup. Okay. Flooding for you was bad.
421740	438380	Yes. You have, you owned a lot of dry things. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, give me the high sign when
438380	442300	our first guests get here. The, just, just so I know, cause I'll, I'll bring them up
442300	447500	like a good idea. Cool. Oh, Spencer, that I'm interpreting that as you thinking the
447500	452140	show's going poorly. Oh, it is. It's terrible. Okay. It's going to be a bad show. It's good
452140	454980	to be on the same page. Sorry guys. I should, I'm going to face over here for the next five
454980	466420	minutes. Uh, then, okay. Will you just at least just come, can she sit up here at least?
466420	474380	That's weirder, isn't it? That's why I follow the weirdness. I, let's make children uncomfortable.
474380	488100	See, this is bad, right? We're having a fun time. Do you want to, do you want to hold
488100	494140	a microphone and make your voice real loud? She knows that. Uh, do you, do you, do you
494140	500820	want to tell us your name? You can, it can be a- My name's Madeleine. Madeleine? Madeleine
500820	507100	or Madeleine? Madeleine. What, you were going to say, you were going to say something? It's
507100	515820	okay. I'm, I'm, I've been uncomfortable for 43 years. It's not going to stop. She was telling
515820	520660	you something. Did she, do you know what she wanted you to- She was saying her name. It's
520660	527220	true. She was. The thing that she was answering was her name. Madeleine, uh, I guess, I guess
527220	532500	you'd probably sick of answering this question, but how old are you? Four. Four? You get that
532500	535940	all the time, right? That's where the interview stops. You're like, if another, if another
535940	540460	person asks how old I am, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to smash.
540460	548980	I can't, I can't even do any bits of it. Uh, don't worry about it. Uh, Madeleine, uh, so
548980	558340	four years, so you were born, uh, like when I, I weighed five less pounds. Try, I don't,
558340	561420	nothing has really happened in my life since in the last four years, but for you, it's
561420	566740	been a real roller coaster ride. Do you, do you, do you, you don't, you can't, you don't,
566740	570260	you don't have prenatal memories. Do you, do you know what, do you, do you have any
570260	579060	idea of, do you, do you remember your birth at all? No. It's probably traumatic. I think
579060	588820	I just, this is probably traumatic. I'm sure, I think being born probably makes Vietnam
588820	597460	look like a jimberie. Uh, we're on vacation, so I had to bring her here. So it's a family
597460	602020	vacation. Okay. Just me and her. So you're saying, but I want you to tell, let these
602020	609060	people know at, at home, you're saying I don't have to filter my show through four year old
609060	619860	ears. No, go for it. Okay. It's your show. All right. Uh, Madeleine, do you, do you have
619860	624900	anything that you're, you're super into like trains or polar bears or dinosaurs or, I mean,
624900	629380	you don't have to pick a thing. I don't want to limit my little pony. Like, uh, you know,
629380	633700	I don't know. I'm not going to pigeonhole you, but you know, like maybe a frozen character.
633700	648580	Oh, she loves Rick. Rick is her Elsa. It's a, it's a new, it's a, it's a new generation.
649780	657060	Uh, uh, so do your parents, uh, are, do you admire them?
657060	664900	Or do you ever think I act like, like these guys, they don't, they don't know what they're
664900	668900	talking about. I asked them who invented peanut butter and jelly and they said they didn't know.
671060	678420	Yeah. Yeah. Is, is, is the world a happy place? Is it by and large, is it stress free or is it
678420	682660	a stressful place? Like when you wake up in the morning, are you stressed out? Do you feel
682660	692180	anxiety? Do you know what anxiety is? I'm sure. Must be nice. Do you get dressed by yourself or do
692180	696500	you still get dressed to the people? Does everybody need to help you put dress to your dress?
699860	702980	I can do it myself. That's great. That's great.
702980	717220	How's, are you going to school yet? I only go to Flamenco.
717220	720660	You only go, wait, to, to Flamenco? She, she takes Flamenco classes.
720660	725780	Flamenco, she only goes to Flamenco class. She's, she's starting school when you get back,
725780	729620	but you don't know, you know, that's a, that's a dance. You don't know any steps yet. Do you,
729620	732820	you just started, you don't want to show us a Flamenco dance?
738420	743700	That's all right. It's privacy is a scarce thing in this post-millennial age.
745140	750740	You're, you're part of the new generation that's going to like crave silence and bicycles.
750740	760100	She actually has her own YouTube channel. That's why she passed a thousand subscribers.
761140	766260	Well, we should plug it probably. What's, what's the, what's the YouTube channel? Can we go there?
770900	774820	Do you want to do the intro for that? I, I'm daddy.
774820	781300	It's, I show my daughter trailers.
781300	786500	All right. Well, we'll, we'll, we won't go there and freak you out. You can keep,
786500	789540	keep practicing and you can come back on the show and let us know when you're ready to,
790260	795540	ready to share your Flamenco with the public. All right, Madeline, you want to go back and,
795540	802820	and, and, and silently wonder what is happening on this? Oh, she's like, okay, we'll stick around.
802820	814260	All right, fine. Do you think I'm really setting myself up for this. Do you think
814260	818580	the show is going okay so far? Thank you.
818580	834020	It didn't matter. Oh my God.
838900	844660	Okay. So, oh, do we have, we, it looks like we have, okay. Let's bring out our,
844740	848420	our old friends, Cameron and Ria, Cameron Esposito and Ria Butcher.
857060	861860	It's just me right now, Dan. I'm sorry. It's just me right now. I'm so sorry, you guys.
862740	868020	I know that. Thank you. I know that people are either fans of Cameron or fans of me. So
868580	872820	the people who are only fans of Cameron, I apologize. Oh man. Well, that means I'm gonna,
872820	878500	I'm gonna come over there. Great. Dan's coming over here. I gotta move my chapstick and my shit.
878500	882580	Sorry. I have to take my chapstick out of my pocket because these jeans are tight. So,
884100	889140	hello Dan. All right. Well, so you guys have a hard out. Hello. We have, this is Madeline. Madeline,
889140	892180	this is Ria. Hi Madeline, nice to meet you. Oh, you don't know what this is. I get it.
895540	900340	She's four. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But she has a, she has a YouTube channel and she does
900420	904740	flamenco. She's taking flamenco lessons. Amazing. All I know about her, she's probably a Republican.
904740	912340	She's got great shoes. I love your shoes. Fantastic shoes. Great. She's adorable.
915540	920820	So, okay. So what you, the, the, the, take my wife. I just, I just, I just, just watch.
921460	922340	Oh, thank you, Dan.
926260	930820	It's Cameron and Ria and it's, you guys, it's very nuanced and touching and it's like, like,
930820	935700	I like it. And it's also shot really well. Oh, thank you. And I like, I like the, the,
936500	940260	like, there's a lot of texts and tweeting, like, like digital stuff. Like, like, that's been a
940260	945220	challenge for all of us. Like, like, like getting that into our narratives on screen. Yeah. How much
945220	950260	of it do you do without feeling like bye-bye birdie bubbles? Absolutely. But, but it works really well.
950260	954340	Oh, thank you very much. Cameron throughout the, it works as like a Greek chorus is what,
954340	959300	is what, is what, yeah, because Cameron throughout the thing is like,
959300	963380	just like checking in and it just says like, you're like, we get it. You're gay.
964500	967380	You know, what's funny about that, Dan, and she'll probably tell this exact same story.
967380	972900	So pretend like I didn't tell it when she gets here is that when we were filming that part of
972980	981460	that episode, her and an episode of her appearance on Comedy Bang Bang came out while we were filming
981460	988580	it. And she got those exact responses on Twitter in actual real life. Right. Even though she had
988580	993220	previously written them as kind of an amalgam of what she had already gotten everything that had
993220	997860	already had, like it had already happened before, but that day it happened again. So it was perfect.
997860	1004260	We were like, yeah, this episode is accurate. I mean, it is like, I mean, if, if, if there's any
1004260	1008660	subversion to it, it's subversion is simply in the fact that it's just a nice, uh, single camera
1008660	1013940	sitcom and it's not necessarily driven by any kind of us versus them energy in spite of the fact
1013940	1019460	that wait for it. These are two women and they're married. All right. Just calm down. Will you calm
1019460	1022980	down? I didn't know about that part. I just, I watched, I'm not done watching the whole thing.
1022980	1026900	Maybe there's a mask involved at the end, which certainly made me more comfortable.
1026980	1028500	Then there's a snow globe at the end.
1031620	1039540	But it's not, the world is absurd, but it's not absurdly like, uh, it's not like everyone doesn't
1039540	1044100	understand. And you know what I mean? Like, it's not like there's a world of straw dogs, which like,
1044100	1048340	I it's, it's just the pretty much normal world, but there's a little bit of mystical realism,
1048340	1054100	just like a, a, a touch to it. I just, I really like the tone and I was like, like, and no,
1054100	1058980	like it's not a spoiler driven thing, but like, cause it's just the story. The, the first episode
1058980	1063780	is the story of you overcoming your fear of committing to this job so much that you would
1063780	1070180	actually quit your real job. And meanwhile, while she's like having these like, like struggles with
1070180	1075460	whether or not she wants to be a comic that mentions you on stage ever. And, uh, and then
1075460	1080340	she's like, she, the, the triumphant return threshold moment is her, uh, you know, like
1080340	1084420	turning sideways to the wings and do it and talking to you instead of the audience. And
1084420	1088100	it's really, it's a really nice moment. It's not overly cloying or anything. I don't know why you
1088100	1094260	don't need my approval. No, no, Dan, actually I do. I don't know. Yeah, this is like the best moment
1094260	1099620	of my life right here. Yeah, I don't know if it's better. I'm like, I watched it. I watched it.
1102100	1106820	But it is, it is cool. I like, it's great. Congratulations. Thank you so much. And SISO
1106820	1113780	is obviously, we're all, we're all in the same boat here. Yeah. I got to be a female sword.
1114340	1123620	Yeah. Oh yeah. Your episode of the watch. Harmon quest. The most amazing wordplay ever
1124340	1128660	in the history, but it's, it's not, it's because the guy's name is Sinax, but he gets his snout
1128660	1136580	cut off and Ria goes Sinax infection. I think it was like in real time. Now that's Sinax infection.
1136580	1143620	Yeah. That's the thing from the show. It's from the show. Yeah. Oh man. That was great.
1143620	1147380	You know, Spencer. Hey, Spencer. How are you doing? I have a question about take my wife. Can
1147380	1154420	I ask a question about taking my wife? How did you decide your characterizations of a married
1154420	1160020	couple? Because obviously you could do, oh, it's just going to be us, but then maybe you want to
1160020	1163780	make things more arch, but then also you might've been like, well, let's write these characters
1163780	1167700	and they'll be based on us, but there'll be characters for the point of plots and stuff.
1167700	1171780	And then obviously, you know, you're being a married couple on television. So that comes
1171780	1175540	into play too. So I'm wondering like, what was your thinking there? Well, I mean,
1176100	1183060	the way we wrote it was we wrote all the, like basically that season is all stuff that happened
1183060	1188980	and then some of it is fictionalized so that people aren't like, Hey, that was me. You know,
1188980	1194340	so like it's, some people are like amalgams of experiences and stuff like that, but it's,
1194340	1199220	I think Cameron calls it like, I don't even remember, like fictionally autobiographical
1199220	1204180	geographic. Yeah. Like everything actually happens. So I mean, the thing about the show
1204180	1208900	is it's kind of the lead up to us being married. So we're not married yet. And it's really us
1209540	1214900	figuring ourselves out within a relationship. And I mean, we just sort of wrote out all the stories
1214900	1219780	that we wanted to cover. And in doing that, we sort of found the characters of Cameron and Rhea
1219780	1223940	there. So it wasn't ever anything where we're like, okay, well, this care, like Rhea is going
1223940	1227700	to be this and Cameron is going to be this. It just sort of organically happened through
1228660	1233700	all that stuff out there. And you know, it's, I just, I just didn't have this conversation,
1233700	1239140	but this thing came up because I didn't know how, what, what was, what to think about it. But
1240100	1251460	a person I know is finishing a pilot and I'm a character in it. And it's like, it's like,
1251460	1255140	these days, I mean, it's like, there's a confessional kind of mandate, the golden age
1255140	1260260	of TV or post golden age of sacking of TV, whatever's going on right now, the, it's kind
1260340	1265860	of like incumbent upon people for our audiences of a maximum of a million people that it actually
1265860	1271140	does need to be a little bit, what needs to be passionate. It needs to be personal. It needs to
1271140	1274660	be sincere. That doesn't automatically mean it needs to be autobiographical. But then again,
1274660	1278740	it's like kind of the easiest thing to do right now. And TV's never been about fighting, like
1278740	1282660	I'm struggling and in terms of the idea. So the easiest thing to do right now is to go,
1282660	1287300	this is me. This is like my world. And this is, this is, that's been a main staple of TV.
1288180	1292100	Anyway, this has been going through the Carsey Werner filter of like, oh, your standup says you
1292100	1297220	like to use tools. Here's your fictional wife. Here's your set. But, but, but so we're still,
1297220	1301300	still at the core of the demand is for, in television is for real people. Why did you just
1301300	1305380	explain that, Dan? I would just be like a jacket saleswoman or something. You know what I mean?
1306180	1309700	But the funny thing is the person knows that because so I'm a character in this person's
1309700	1315780	script. And it's important that I'm 43. It's important that I, I'm at a kind of a more
1315780	1322260	comfortable place in my career than this person is. It's, there's so many details about,
1322260	1328740	about it being me that make it, that are important to where that, to the situation this person is in,
1328740	1335140	that it's kind of dumb to go through it and go, make it flan farming. And, but, but, but the one,
1335140	1340500	but the thing is then there's a shot where the person is looking at a wall of my house and
1340500	1344740	there's like a community poster and all the things. It's like just the things like community and
1345780	1351540	whatever else I've done. The, the, there's an Emmy, I guess. I don't know. It's for the
1351540	1359300	Oscars who are Hugh Jackman hosted. I won an Emmy for writing the Oscars. I try not to bring it up.
1361060	1367380	But, but I was like, I read the thing and I was like, Oh, you should change like community to
1368740	1375060	like crazy community college show. And I don't know what it was. I just think that's an interesting
1375060	1381300	concept when we're doing these like weird, like meta things, like what is the rule there? It's
1381300	1384260	kind of like why you ask the question, right? Like, what do you, what do you, you know,
1384260	1388260	we were in great minds obviously. And also I don't think great care was taken in our
1388260	1393140	characterizations beforehand. They just kind of grew out of the storyline. So I was just curious.
1393140	1396660	I don't know. Yeah, that's interesting. Cause it's like, you start with a dynamic, like, like,
1396660	1399780	so it's like, Oh, it was important is that you were working for me and everything kind of
1399780	1404820	bloomed out of that. Yeah. So you get me as like this weird Jack Donaghy to your Liz Lemon.
1408180	1413140	But yeah, it's, it's, it's funny. Boy, boy, writing about myself is fascinating.
1414660	1417540	Oh yeah. Madeleine, don't you think it's fascinating?
1421300	1427220	Solid no on that one. That makes it when she lets you know, things are going good and you feel it.
1427300	1430900	Oh yeah. Because she's not, she hasn't developed a moral conscience yet.
1430900	1436340	She doesn't even know what a handshake is. No, she just said, she has no reason she will not
1436340	1444900	smoke up your ass. She's like, I liked it. I didn't like it. Um, you know, I mean, it's like,
1444900	1448500	like, like there's certain demographic things that make me go like, well, who cares? It's like,
1448500	1453380	you're not, you know, I'm not going to do a show about the times tables. I don't care.
1453380	1458900	I don't care what these people find entertaining. I have to express myself. Absolutely.
1465460	1468500	So anyways, do you guys hear about these itsy bitsy spiders?
1475940	1477780	She's doing it. She's doing it with her fingers.
1483380	1487300	Well, now I want one.
1490900	1498260	If they're going to do that, 20 bucks, 20 bucks, 20 bucks. All right. Well, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
1498260	1504820	hey, uh, yeah, let's, let's do that. I like, cause I'm, I summon my wife, Cameron Esposito.
1504820	1509140	Your wife, she's here. Here, you take this one.
1509140	1519780	Hey, hi. Hello, the audience. This is Madeline. Hey, Madeline. This is Madeline.
1521700	1525700	She was just doing a real cool, itsy bitsy spider a second ago. You know what? I saw it
1525700	1534340	and you are legit very good at that. It was my idea. It's my idea. I brought it. Yeah.
1534340	1542020	I came up with it. I didn't create it, but I, story by, I adapted it. Definitely like a story
1542020	1548740	by story by for sure. Uh, have you ever gone on a bear hunt, Madeline? Uh, like in, in,
1548740	1551540	yeah. Cause you haven't been, they don't do it. They don't do that stuff in flamenco school.
1551540	1556180	They're like, you warm up. This isn't kindergarten and start flamencing. Uh,
1556180	1560260	what if she had though, Dan, what if she had what did she put on an actual bear hunt and was like,
1560340	1565380	a real one? Oh no, but I was talking about that. You, did you, you, you guys never like in
1565380	1569060	kindergarten or nursery school. Like there was like this, I don't know. There was this thing.
1569060	1575620	I don't think they still do this. The kids would replace this. Well, this was before my time. I
1575620	1581380	think they seemed very problematic. The teacher would go, we're going on a bear hunt, bear hunt,
1581380	1583860	bear had, I don't know if there was like a chant to it or not, but they would,
1583860	1587380	there was a lot of call and response and they would, so the kids would all go like this.
1587380	1590580	And then they go like, oh, we're going to go across the stream. There's a stream.
1594340	1600740	That's true. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, everything's an exercise in conformity,
1600740	1605860	especially public school. Uh, keep, keep in mind, sir, a bear gets hunted
1607380	1612660	and becomes the hunter. They're not to spoil it, but you go on the whole bear hunt and you
1612660	1616500	see the bear and the bear comes after you and you run and you do all the other stuff.
1616500	1619620	I think it, I think it's more an exercise in like story structure because it's like,
1619620	1624500	makes you go backward and forward through a thing. You, you, you take note of the things you do while
1624500	1628900	you get to the bear. You meet with the goddess of seeing the bear. You atone with the father of
1628900	1634180	realizing the bear found you. You recharge back across the return threshold and you go home
1634180	1642100	having changed into a kid that, that didn't set fire to the gymnasium. Uh, definitely,
1642100	1646820	definitely storytelling's primary function is to keep young people from burning down whatever
1646820	1652500	white houses are in the vicinity. Absolutely. Ideally directing your energy towards a cultural
1652500	1657060	other. Like that's what Campbell says, like, especially like adolescent boys need to be
1657060	1661620	like told the reason why you not only think you could destroy everything right now,
1661620	1669140	but probably could is because of a great thunder god that the neighbors really don't want you to
1669140	1676660	achieve. Um, so hate them and, and, and go to, go to, go to math class and register for selective
1676660	1684340	service to the draft Madeline. If you, if you get drafted, it'll be against cool space bugs.
1686660	1688660	You're going to get a jet pack when you get drafted.
1688660	1698900	It's all right. It's okay. Look, this is going to happen. It's live podcasting.
1698900	1701540	People are going to, people, there's going to, there's going to be contention.
1705220	1715380	Whoa. Oh no, we don't have security here, by the way. We have like a kid that works in the
1715380	1722500	Alan Moore section. That's just, he's scary, but he doesn't, he's not, he doesn't do anything.
1722500	1728180	Usually he just watches the watch. Oh, that's who does it. I don't know.
1729060	1734340	That's who does that. He watches the watch, but in typical Alan Moore fashion,
1734340	1738820	he doesn't really enjoy it very much. He's like, this could have been better. Uh,
1739780	1745620	all right. Madeline's, she's, she's, usually Dan's the one that gets poetry. Now she's warmed up.
1747620	1754020	So, Madeline, all right. What, what, what's the scariest thing? I'm asking not just because I
1754020	1760180	want to scare a child. I have, I have, I have other guests coming soon and there's a fear of,
1760180	1764260	a theme of fear. So I'm just wondering, is there something that scares you?
1765060	1773140	Like I could, I could, I'll go, I'll tell you, spiders scare me a lot and clowns and, and,
1775700	1781300	and, uh, uh, I guess, I guess like, uh, leaving the house,
1784660	1789060	getting into a shower when, and not knowing that the water is going to get like really hot after
1789060	1796580	I get into it. Um, uh, I like this person who's trying to put words in a child's mouth.
1796580	1805540	Yeah. Is that the same person who was like conformity failure? I do whatever. Listen,
1805540	1814580	kids say failure. It's Donald Trump's political advisor. I saw a thing on a TV ad and the volume
1814580	1818660	was down, so I don't even know. And it's kind of cool to not know whether this was a democratic ad
1818660	1823380	or like a splinter Republican ad, but it was just like, I just saw a bunch of images of Donald
1823380	1827300	Trump and then it would, and then the, it was a negative ad and it said like Donald Trump,
1827300	1832020	dangerous. And I was like, I liked the fact that I didn't know that could have been like some weird
1832020	1836820	like group of like Republicans that was like, not weird, like I guess more normal than the rest,
1836820	1842820	like going like, but I liked that. I liked this car. I, it made me happy because, because I feel
1842820	1849780	like, uh, uh, if, if we can admit that we don't like a guy because dangerous, like that's actually,
1849780	1853860	there's a little like lobe in my head that goes like, wait, you should be dangerous. And then I
1853860	1857620	go, wait a minute. No, we want to be comfortable and we need to admit that more. We need to be less
1857620	1863460	hyperbolic about our politics and more like practical and go like, look, look at this guy.
1863460	1869540	He's a turd. Like that's scary. Vote for not scary. Like you always do anyway, except you pat
1869540	1873380	yourself on the back afterwards and put on a cape and say, I did something heroic today by
1873380	1878900	voting for comfort. Like I think, you know, like we're, we're, there's like good dangerous and bad
1878900	1883380	dangerous. Like when people talk about Hillary and I know people are hearing me shocked to find out that
1884660	1889940	I like her. Um, when people talk about Hillary, they talk about her being dangerous, but it's
1889940	1894180	people will be like, cause she's done like backdoor deals with everybody and she's probably
1894180	1900020	responsible for a lot of murders. And she has single-handedly met and done every, and I'm like,
1901140	1908580	yeah, it sounds like a president. Like sounds like a person that runs this country
1909140	1913060	since the first time that somebody was like, you, you should run this country.
1913060	1919540	Hey, old wooden tooth. You own people. Do you want to run this place?
1919780	1925940	I mean like that's, and then, but then it's funny cause now, so there, I feel like that's like
1925940	1932820	dangerous in the way that our country has always, that's us. I'm not saying we're great. We have a
1932820	1937060	lot of stuff we can improve on, but that's definitely us. Like that's for sure us. We're
1937060	1943700	terrible. We are, we're the worst. We don't own this place. We stole this place. This belongs to
1943700	1948260	meltdown. Um, no, like we don't know this. We stole this place. We're, we're all, we've always
1948260	1954980	been dangerous. Then it, then he is dangerous in relief to that because his thing is like, I could
1956980	1965940	I'll blow it up. Why wouldn't I use the nuclear weapons? Yeah. Why, why, why can't I,
1966820	1975300	we got them. They spent a lot of money. Yeah. I mean, it is, it is a time in which we've,
1975300	1980340	yeah, I, I shamefully find myself just craving status quo, which I have on a level that I never
1980340	1984980	have. Cause it's like, you're looking down the gaping maw of actual historical like things where
1984980	1990660	you go like, oh, this is, as I've said, and I really, again, unashamed, like it's fine. Hitler
1990660	1995540	comparisons are fine. The earlier, the better. That's the point of them. Hitler, the healthy
1995540	2000580	version of a Hitler comparison is the earliest one in the world. The most premature one. Imagine if
2000580	2005060	the Hitler comparison had happened early on in Hitler's career. If someone had gone, this guy's
2005060	2010580	Hitler. Uh, uh, then, you know, like, like, I don't know. Well, there's also like two different
2010580	2014340	types of dangerous. There's like, so there's like, there's like Hitler dangerous. And then there's
2014340	2029780	also like, like if you think about a spot, she said, like three minutes ago, I want to talk now.
2029780	2034260	I was like, you can talk if you want to. And then, all right, Madeline, let's, let's, let's hear it.
2034260	2036340	I mean, I guess what I'm saying is women of the future. Clearly.
2038660	2039940	What were you going to say, Madeline?
2042180	2046740	Oh, you just said it. You just said blah, blah, blah. You just, I mean, I can't tell you,
2046740	2050420	you're four. So I don't know if that's mocking us or if that's actually like half of what you know
2050420	2056340	how to say. Oh no, it's mocking us. I feel like for the podcast, she's going to sound even younger,
2056340	2066180	like an actual baby was up here. Well, maybe that will be next week. Oh yeah. Hey, Madeline,
2066180	2074980	I heard that you are a fart head. Oh boy. I don't know that this is healthy.
2078180	2083460	It's actually okay. There are adult men mouth agape at that. Just, I just, I looked at this
2083460	2091460	dude specifically and he went like, it's actually right. Dude's fired. It's actually right up our
2091460	2096660	alley. Do you want to tell them our nickname for each other? Okay. Well then I'll tell them because
2096660	2101940	you're a butt head. Oh boy. They call each other butt heads and stuff. All right. Well,
2101940	2107140	we have to make room for my, my neighbors are coming up and they have a special, you guys
2107140	2115140	remember Beth Butzen, right? Oh no. Oh, this is the dark side of show business.
2117460	2119620	No, Madeline, you're still going to be, you're going to be right there.
2121940	2131140	Oh God. Oh, Spencer gets to be proven right again. Yeah, man. All right. But think about this,
2131140	2136980	Spencer. If we hadn't gone through all of that, no show. It's not that I'm happy about being
2137060	2142340	right all the time. It's just that I see it when it's going to happen. Yeah. Yeah. But what if I
2142340	2147620	saw it too? What was I supposed to do? I did the, what was I supposed to do? No, it's great. This is
2147620	2155220	a great show. Let's how, how is it? How about that? Take my wife? Uh, yeah. Don't you guys have
2155220	2159460	heart out? Not that long. Can't, can't, Cameron, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a scene
2159460	2163700	and take my wife where you're out at lunch and you're in like an outdoor, uh, restaurant. Oh,
2163780	2169540	I can't, I'm sorry, Madeline. You're okay. You'll be okay. She did great. I just said, I just don't
2169540	2173300	know. I didn't like the sound of my own voice talking at the same time as a, as a person that
2173300	2176740	was like sobbing and I'm like, like, I'm ignoring it. Like it's some Orwellian thing.
2180820	2187060	Sort of a, get that baby out of here. Oh man. That's what I know. Now I know why. Let's not do
2187060	2195860	that. Yeah. When we say we're okay with this, we don't change our stance. I love it. This is what
2195860	2202100	America's all about. I learned from a hit Pixar movie, uh, that, that feeling sad is just as much
2202100	2210100	a part of life as feeling good. Yeah. And I, and I, and I, and I, and I learned that while losing my
2210100	2220340	Oscar. And I thought that's fine. That's what that movie that took my Oscar, uh, said, this is fine.
2221780	2229380	And I cried and I loved it. The mom, the mom was controlled by sadness. Great film.
2234180	2239860	So there's a scene where your, uh, Cameron's out on a, uh, she's eating lunch at an outdoor, uh,
2240180	2243860	cafe, but there's like, and, and Ria's blowing up in the, and then there's like,
2243860	2247620	there's one shot of you and it's like pushing on you and you're like, or I don't think it's
2247620	2251940	pushing on you. It's just like the static. There's no music and it's just you by yourself at a
2251940	2257220	restaurant. Like do you, do you, do you, do you like the, do you, do you know the like expression
2257220	2262820	I'm thinking of? Like when you're like, you're kind of like, is it just you like, are you, are
2262820	2268420	you going through like, uh, like, is it, is it like, it's like, it's like a, it's like a,
2269860	2273460	because we're, because we're not specifically tracking in that moment that it's, it's like,
2273460	2277700	are you just uncomfortable in your own skin? Like you're, cause you're alone. Yes. Yeah. Right. No,
2277700	2285140	that I actually know exactly what you're asking. Um, yeah, it's supposed to be
2285940	2291700	not knowing where to focus energy. Right. So like, I'm just sitting by myself alone at a cafe and
2291700	2298500	thinking maybe I see somebody that I know, like awkwardly waving, kind of like hide in, uh,
2299220	2302500	crawl inside of myself. And then right after you do that, you like wave and you go, no,
2302500	2307460	like that. And then a leaf falls in the background. I guess it obviously wasn't planned, but I love it
2307460	2312100	so much. Why do you think that wasn't planned? Just like dead leaf, just fault. The last, I was,
2312100	2318340	I told it to do that. We had a serious rig and they're like, let the leaf go. Get the one leaf,
2318820	2325540	get the leaf, get the leaf. It's like 10, okay. Leave to one and bring the leaf to one, bring
2325540	2336820	the leaf to one and just like leaf it. Leaf it. The leaf industry doesn't have more precise
2336820	2343220	language than this thing and leaf it. Well, that could mean 5,000 things. I'm a union employee
2343220	2349780	who solely focuses on leaves and you just say leaf it when I, do you want them to blow across a
2350580	2357940	detective's driveway? I would love to see the leaf person on like every show, just like
2357940	2362900	leaf blowers attached to the belt. It seems like the leaf person on a set, that's one of those
2362900	2367780	jobs that has a name that doesn't have leaf or a Latin like root of leaf. Rare. It's, it's, it's a
2367780	2373460	called like something like a squibbler and you find out it's the leaf wrangler. And if you ever
2373460	2380420	call them that or her, absolutely. Thank you, Dan. Great point. Great point. That's a great point.
2380420	2385700	That's amazing. That's amazing. You know, you didn't have to use that second pronoun.
2387140	2395060	You did. And that's amazing. That's really what we need. Acknowledgement of women. Right. Yeah.
2395060	2402500	There sure are women. Do you know what is right next year? Dan, did you see our, not,
2402500	2409940	I'm pointing this way. There's a billboard with our dumb faces on it. Yeah. Actually, I didn't,
2409940	2413620	I didn't know there was one here in this neighborhood, but I saw it right by the Chipotle.
2414500	2419540	You guys took me off. You replaced me. That's great. That's what it should be.
2420340	2423780	That's what television should be. I think. Right.
2425220	2434100	Replacing you with a white male. Yeah. Yeah. That's what we need. I think.
2436340	2442020	Thank you. Thank you. I just want to acknowledge that two dudes are being applauded for their
2442020	2448260	bravery. No, we are very brave in acknowledging that women are cool and you guys are pretty
2449060	2457780	light on the claps for Rihanna. No, we went, we went and we asked a stranger to take a picture.
2457780	2462100	We just stopped a stranger. We went over to the billboard and we were standing in front of it
2462100	2466100	and we asked a woman who was passing by. We were like, Hey, do you mind taking a picture of us? And
2466100	2471700	she was like, Oh sure. Like just what, like in front of what? In front of what? Because we were
2471780	2478340	like just on the street. And then we were like, um, and it was actually so cute because she goes,
2478340	2485540	Oh my God, you guys. And she gave us a giant hug. And like, this is a stranger. We did not know this
2485540	2492340	person. Was it? Was it? Oh my God. You guys, uh, I didn't recognize you and I actually knew
2492340	2495940	you from before. Or is it? Oh my God. You're two other human beings and you're on that.
2495940	2503380	Yeah. She was like, I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. Who are you?
2506420	2510420	It was very cute. It was like a cute moment. She took a bunch of it. She like,
2510420	2515620	she was like, check them. Make sure you check them. I don't want to be the one that messes up for you.
2517620	2523700	And then a guy was like running headphones came by and he went, Hey, that's you. Cause he had his
2523700	2529860	headphones in and he was like, this goes. And I was like, yeah, yeah. He yelled. It's so loud.
2529860	2534740	It was really adorable. It was a fun, but also loud. It was super fun. I don't think, I don't
2534740	2538660	know. I don't think, except maybe in cartoon form, there was a Harmon quest billboard. I don't think
2538660	2544260	I've ever, I've, I don't, I, that's a feeling. I don't know. I don't know. No, like, uh, like,
2544260	2550900	looking, there's your bed's all big. It feels pretty good. Okay. I don't even know. I mean,
2550980	2555700	do you pull over the car? Do you, and that was the, oh yeah, we parked and got Chipotle and
2555700	2558740	we literally did eat that at the Chipotle that's directly under the
2559540	2564260	thing of us, which is like shameful. Yeah. Yeah. Did you, did, did, did, did, were you,
2564260	2568020	were you able to just look at it while you ate? We went around the corner so that we were not near
2568020	2570660	there, but there definitely were people who were eating at Chipotle that were like,
2574420	2576740	there's something very familiar about all this.
2577380	2582100	I have to get a quote in for Back to the Future at some point.
2584980	2588900	All right. So you guys, I, I, I heard a rumor that you guys needed to,
2588900	2592660	to get out of here at nine, but, but I don't want to, I do. You can stay. Yeah.
2595940	2598660	I can stay. Yeah. I mean, if you can, I didn't mean to put you on this. No, yeah,
2598660	2602260	you could. I mean, you know, um, we live together. We live together.
2607620	2611780	I, I'm ready to teach Donald Trump a thing or two about being dangerous.
2616500	2620980	Yes. I live with, I live with my wife. Yeah. So dangerous.
2622580	2626180	You missed me proving that I've seen the first episode of the show before you got out.
2626180	2631140	He did. And then I liked it very much. He liked it very much. Thank you. We are so stoked because
2631140	2636900	it got like a bunch of people cared about it. And I, I mean, honestly, you know what
2636900	2642020	this is like. I, this was the first time for me, you spend aware of the, of time and space
2642020	2645060	and television. And you know that a lot of things, nobody, a bunch of people were like,
2645860	2648180	cool. And then we were like, awesome.
2653780	2657700	Yeah. And so, and, and, and, and there make, there may be a time when you,
2658340	2663860	the, the, that nightmare that you were maybe dreading, you'll have to, that'll have to happen
2663860	2668980	too. And like, but both of them will be like, you'll wake up the next morning alive. It's like,
2668980	2674500	it's like a bingo card. You know, like I, I, like, I remember, uh, yeah, I just, I remember
2674500	2679060	like this cat, this thing that we did was like this pilot in the nineties. And it was just like,
2679060	2683300	no, we don't want that. And like, just cried. It just went to the car. I was like,
2683300	2688660	and it was, it was a really, it was a good thing because it was like, like salty hot tears.
2688660	2691940	I was like, I'm not crying because I'm a spoiled baby. I am a spoiled baby,
2691940	2698020	but that's not why I'm crying. I'm crying because I really, really care. And that's a good thing. And
2698020	2703460	it's like, there is, you're not receptive to it in that moment. It does. Nothing feels like you're
2703460	2709380	getting good or better or being, but, but what is happening in that moment is like the germination
2709460	2713460	of some kind of seed where you're like, well, one thing's for sure. I belong here. I got,
2713460	2719220	because like, this is like, like, like, I don't like people like, uh, not, not watching me.
2720980	2726020	There's no romantic or charismatic way to put it. I actually think maybe this was the first
2726020	2729940	experience I've had in my career that wasn't that. And I don't mean that, like, of course,
2730900	2735220	you know, it's been bit by bit and success by success. It's not like I'm been toiling in
2735220	2740580	obscurity, but for 15 years, I feel like there have been very loud noise, very loud voices that
2740580	2744740	really liked what I was doing and very light voices that wanted me to stop talking about being gay.
2744740	2749780	Uh, and that that was like a thing that I heard just so many times, just like,
2749780	2753540	this person is not funny. Stop talking about being gay. We don't care about this. And then,
2753540	2758420	we get it. Yeah, we get it. You're gay. We get it. You're gay is will be my epitaph. Like, for sure.
2758420	2766420	It should be your, we got it. She was. No, I know. I have tweeted. Um,
2767220	2770580	no, I mean, that, that will be my epitaph. But you know,
2774180	2778980	but this was really like a huge weight off the shoulders because like the New York Times and
2778980	2783300	vulture and indie wire and navy club were just like, we get it. She's gay. But in like, uh,
2783300	2787540	they're like, we get it. She's gay. And I was like, so it was really nuts.
2787540	2794900	So is the other one. Yeah, I'm just talking about my experience. Oh, I know. I'm just
2794900	2801060	riffing. That's all. I don't think I'm not Dr. Phil, but I don't think Rio was saying that
2801060	2809700	you were transcribed. All right. Well, we'll deal with this later. Um, uh, so many people are also
2809700	2813780	really stoked about re on this show, which is really cool. It's like a real breakout moment
2813780	2820820	for her. And it's really awesome. Well, I assume that's going to be a theme of the,
2824100	2828180	is that going to be the theme of the, of the show? Cause I've, I've, I've seen one episode,
2828180	2833540	but is that, is that a thing? I mean, if it, regardless of, of gender persuasion,
2833620	2839460	uh, uh, uh, uh, what are the other things? Uh, pris, pris, prismatology, um, uh, cosmological
2839460	2847220	shift, shiftage, um, uh, continuum of, of, of, of, of, of rep, rep, rep, rep, rep, rep,
2847220	2852900	rep, rep us to a sovereignty. Um, uh, the regardless of like, like two people doing the
2852900	2858020	same thing at the same time automatically, like, is there, is there a story coming up?
2858980	2864420	And if not, is there, well, is there's where people, people want to drive a wedge between
2864420	2869540	those things. Like they, they, that's how they, we, we eat lobster by breaking it open. Like,
2869540	2876340	like, like if, if you guys are delicious as a couple, like inevitably the consuming of you
2876340	2883460	as a couple is going to involve people testing the hinges of the claw bridge, putting, putting
2883460	2888020	pressure on the, have you experienced that? Do you, do you know that's coming? Yeah.
2889380	2893860	I mean, I think it's been there the whole time. People will ask us if we're competitive with each
2893860	2898340	other, which is the funniest thing to ask to stand up comics. Cause you wouldn't do,
2898340	2906020	you wouldn't do this job if you didn't think you were the best stand up comic to ever exist,
2906020	2910740	period. Like there's no other reason you would do this to yourself. And also it's a total
2910740	2914100	privilege and what a ridiculous thing to say, but I just mean you wouldn't get up on stage and
2914100	2920180	fail this much if you weren't like, I'll show them. And so like, do you think you're the,
2920180	2927380	do you think you're a better stand up comic than me? Absolutely. Yeah. No, but like you do, right?
2927380	2932500	Yeah, of course. Like you want, like you want, you want what's best for me and you love me so much.
2932500	2935620	Yeah. I want you to totally succeed, but I am going to succeed more than you. Right.
2936340	2942340	Like, so what I want to do is I want to lift you up and I want people to see how great you are and
2942340	2945620	to see you through my eyes and just like to love you. And I want to, you know,
2945620	2953700	put a foot on your face and kick you back down. She's like a grappling hook or a fire ladder.
2953700	2959940	Yeah. I lift you up. I hook you into something above me that is soft enough to secure anchor.
2959940	2965620	I climb over you. That's exactly right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I think what you're, I thought
2965620	2970340	maybe where you were going was that, oh, it's actually easier in such a, when you combine a
2970340	2978340	naturally, uh, the universe will seek to find crevices, uh, thing like being a couple, um, that,
2978340	2984020	that's entropy and the outside world will do its work as sure as water does. You drop anything
2984020	2988020	into a glass of it and the water, it may look pretty, but the water is silently going like,
2988020	2993540	is there a way to pick this apart? You know? Um, anyways, that's a tangent, but, um, uh,
2993540	2999460	I'll tell it to my chemist. The, uh, uh, Dan's actually incorrect about the properties of water.
3002260	3010500	Subreddit. Uh, but, but I think I thought maybe what you were, what you were getting at was that
3011460	3017460	because standups are so ridiculously solipsistic, so like narcissistic, so, so like, like, like,
3017940	3022900	that you actually, it is an easy thing to just put two of them in a house together and let them
3022900	3028340	both try to be standups. And there's, there's a, there's a, there's a kind of select few situations
3028340	3035460	in which that, that, that, that, that Ernie and Bert partnership could be turned into like enmity
3035460	3041460	or jealousy, but those things would be offset if Ernie and Bert were like, also then like, like,
3041460	3046100	they're okay. We're actually living together because we love each other. Like they do. Yeah,
3046100	3051060	no, right. They're totally a couple, but actually, yeah, I think you're, I think you are right. I mean,
3051060	3056980	I will say I don't feel a ton of jealousy. I feel competition in our relationship and I feel,
3058180	3061860	but I don't feel jealous. Here's what I worry about. My girlfriend, here's what I worry about.
3061860	3066580	I'm not trying to bend it back to me. I bend it like it, but if I did, it would go something like
3066580	3072580	this. The, the, uh, ghost of Jeff is everywhere. The, the, um, I, I, I, I, I worry about with,
3072580	3077940	with Cody, who's, uh, 11, 12 years younger than me and who I want. I'm so tired. I don't want to
3077940	3081540	work. I swear I think of that. I don't want to work anymore. And like, I saw, I have fantasies
3081540	3086420	about her, you know, Celine Dioning and I can be that guy with the beard that could just be like,
3086420	3091540	I love Celine Dion and I'm so old and lucky. Well, then you should have got to her younger.
3091540	3098020	Honestly. Um, that is a really specific Celine Dion joke. If you understood Celine like I do,
3098100	3103700	that'd be so funny. It's okay. We can move on. Uh, but, but I, but I have a weird feeling
3103700	3110340	about Celine Dion on podcasts. That's just a joke for anyone that's watched the show.
3111940	3116020	But yes, go ahead. I have a weird feeling that I would get, I would, as soon as I,
3116020	3121700	it wouldn't be about achievement. I wouldn't, I wouldn't want anybody to, it's not that I don't
3121700	3127140	wait. I'm trying to stack these negatives like a Jenga tower here. It's, it's not that I don't
3127140	3132820	want my partner to be successful. Far from it. I want the, like, like I consider that such an
3132820	3137620	ironic concept, uh, for anyone to be, as you were talking about that same thing. It's like, I'm all,
3138660	3145140	that's such a hilarious idea. I am so behind it. It's like, like, like, like, but that the,
3145140	3149460	but at the same time that that feels like sincerity, like, oh my God, my fantasy would be
3149460	3157060	that, that you would, would be like, just like all, like the idea of me being jealous of someone's
3157060	3161140	success. Like I would love that. I would love that. But I do, and I, I think the thing that
3161140	3166500	I would screw up is that I would, it would just be regular jealousy because I would think,
3166500	3172340	I would turn it into a thing where I was like, uh, she's out there with people. It would be a
3172340	3178820	sexual thing. The, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be a, I, I wouldn't have like, I wouldn't have career
3178820	3184660	jealousy, but it would quickly turn into a gateway to something I still haven't figured out, which is
3184660	3191860	like how to not be. Like I, I just, I don't trust myself to, to not be like, that guy is so cuter.
3191860	3195540	Like, like, like what? Just just be with him. And like, I'm just like, and it just drives me nuts.
3195540	3199700	Like I'm, I'm just going to sit home and play Minecraft and take care of our baby. And then,
3199780	3204180	like, uh, and then I'm just going to be like, obviously she would be in love with anybody but
3204180	3208260	me right now. You know, like, like that's where it would, but that don't odd because that's horrible
3208260	3213060	serial killer, like stuff with a support system. Like it's not, you shouldn't, because that's
3213060	3216900	jealousy and it's toxic and it's gross. But I don't mean to tell you that lesbians are awesome,
3216900	3222980	but you know, what's a cool thing about being in a same sex couple is that the scissor thing. Yeah.
3222980	3231300	Yeah. I say no more. That's number one. I've seen the movie. No, that's not real. Um,
3231300	3237540	that's not real. Um, that's not a real thing. Um, looked real to me.
3239620	3246660	Riley Reed ain't no, uh, she didn't. No, those women are not having a good time. Um,
3246660	3250980	that's not how that works. I'll tell you about it later. But, um,
3253620	3258180	oh, I think, I mean, I don't know. Do you, do you have partner jealousy towards me? I don't really,
3258180	3264820	I find that a cool part of it is like, well, number one, we're, we are both, we are both, uh,
3265460	3269780	moderately recognizable. I don't mean we're super famous, but I mean, most of the time when we meet
3269780	3274100	people, it's like after a show. And so that's a situation where there's already a weird power
3274100	3280580	dynamic. And so it's not like a, it's not actually super fun to go and talk. Nothing's
3280580	3285380	going to happen. It's going to be really weird. I don't, that's, that feels gross and not fun to,
3285380	3288660	cause that person doesn't know you, they're a stranger and, but they do know you because
3288660	3292260	they know you from podcasts. Anyway, it's weird. Uh, you don't know them at all and they might
3292260	3298020	eat you. So it's a whole thing, but not in the good way. Um, my point is there's that. And then
3298020	3302660	I think the other thing is like, we share, uh, you know, we're both into the same thing.
3304500	3310340	Which is when people, oh yeah, that's a cool thing is that we can both be like, Hey,
3312180	3318180	nice. She's cute. Yeah, exactly. Oh God. Hey, nice. And then we go like high five. I get it. Okay. I
3318180	3322580	just, I just, that's a, like, there are so many things that are not great, but that's a good part.
3322580	3328500	Yeah. That makes sense. Being like, Oh, I'm not jealous of you about that interaction. Like,
3328500	3332740	Hey, I get it. Keep going. She's cute. Allow me to watch you talk to her,
3332820	3335220	you know, like it's where you'd be able to file it in the same place. Like,
3335220	3339300	I don't know how to file it. If a guy, like there's like a combination of like,
3339940	3344180	like what, I don't know. It's like, it's like, if he's everything that I'm not like,
3344180	3348820	I don't know where to file it. If like, I see my girlfriend, like, like having a good time
3348820	3353220	talking to him, like, can I pose this to you, Dan? Can I just put this? If he's everything
3353220	3357620	that you're not, then she wants nothing to do with him because she likes you.
3362740	3372500	That was such a like daytime talk show. Not, not sentence from Ria, but your guys reaction,
3375060	3381060	the time that it took. Like, I don't know if you guys had, I don't know if you could hear you,
3381060	3385220	but it was like, you all waited for me to say the full sentence and then you thought about it.
3386180	3387060	And then you were like,
3389780	3396340	all right, I've been rude to our second guest. Yes. So I have to go. Yeah. Oh, shit. You have
3396340	3399620	to go. Yeah. Yeah. I do have to go. But I'm just going to say this one thing. I also just put out
3399620	3406580	an album on Friday. Oh, that's why I'm wearing a shirt. It's number one. Number one. Number one.
3408820	3413700	And thank you, Dan. You bet. You're the best. I have keys in my hand. This is weird. That was
3413780	3417780	called butcher. You buy it on iTunes. You're a cool rock story. Thanks for, come on.
3418740	3421220	Sorry. I'm just picking up what you, listen, go my wife. I got it.
3422660	3424180	Ria Butcher, everybody.
3428660	3433220	So there's going to be two more guests. Yeah. No, I think, I think them coming right in between
3433220	3439620	us will be, will be a good thing. Yeah. It was 9 11. It is. You're right. Never forget. You're
3439620	3445060	right. Never forget that Andy Dick, 9 11, September 11th, Andy Dick's coming to the show.
3445060	3452420	Rudy Giuliani forgot. He just, he did forget. He did forget. It's pretty fun. I mean,
3453380	3459060	of all, I'm not saying 9 11 should be more memorable to anybody, but you know, he really,
3459060	3466420	it was his favorite national tragedy. Like, like he really loved that thing. Like he loved it more
3466500	3471860	than it was like, Jesus wakes up on September 25th, December 25th. What is this? What's all this
3471860	3478100	stuff? When I, when I think of what's Easter about, does anyone know what this is? I think
3478100	3484260	Rudy Giuliani's theme song for his relationship between him and 9 11 is Lady in Red or like,
3484260	3489140	like, like, it's like, it's like a ballad. It's like a beautiful, like, you're over across the
3489140	3494740	thing and then you're like, I met you and it was crazy. Mix and wakes up. I don't know how I feel
3494740	3499540	about crooks. Like, it just feels like you remember that thing that was important to you, right?
3500340	3504340	Yeah. Maybe time to check them out. Put a little popsicle stick in his mouth. See if he remembers,
3504340	3511620	you know, see if he's still Alice. You know what I'm saying? Yep. Don't I ever know what you're
3511620	3522180	saying. All right. That didn't, that didn't land. I thought it was CF. Oh, man. I wish you could
3522180	3529380	just drive my car home when I can't drive your car. Because I drive stick. They love stick.
3533540	3539140	Oh, we get it. Okay. Yeah. Whoa. And they caught it. God damn it.
3541620	3543940	You guys ever noticed lesbians always have each other's keys?
3543940	3553220	New stereotype. Coin to stereotype. Talk about dangerous. This is a momentous occasion.
3554980	3557220	It's a competition between me, you and Donald Trump.
3559140	3564740	Someone's going to emerge as the most dangerous tonight. Speaking of danger and fear and things
3564740	3572820	that scare you. Oh, an ooky, spooky Halloween's just around the corner. Actually, no, it's not,
3572820	3580180	which is why I think it's a good idea. Don't just say anything. Vincent Price. Vincent Price is
3580180	3586580	here. Is he alive? It's like when people at a Torrey Amos concert, they go like, they yell out
3586580	3597060	like, Angie Dickinson. No, I get it. I'm dating myself, which you can do. Look it up. Three states
3597060	3606820	allow it. You guys remember my neighbor, Beth Bootson of the eucalyptus tree.
3609220	3618420	So I'm just going to bring her and her son Timor up. And if I try to introduce what we're talking
3618420	3626180	about, I'll ruin it. Welcome them to the stage. Here's Beth Bootson and Timor.
3628020	3629300	Beth and Timor.
3633860	3643220	All right. So the, I mean, the, the, the, the, this is the Cameron, by the way. Beth, Cameron.
3645620	3651460	Whoa. You have met. We just met now. We met just now. Nice. Okay. I'm just worried about that mic,
3651460	3657540	man. Worried about that mic. It'll be fine. Okay. So you guys are my neighbors. Hello. Can you hear
3657540	3663220	me? Yeah. Yeah. Timor, you want to get a level? Testing, testing. Oh yeah. Okay. That's how you
3663220	3671060	use a mic. Okay. So it's what? It's August? Yeah. It started in May. It started in May. Okay. It
3671060	3675860	started in May. Okay. For a year, but it started years ago. What are you guys talking about? Oh,
3675860	3680660	my God. It's like a lifetime movie. Like, like, like, like cold open crawl. What's,
3680660	3687860	what's happening now? I know what this looks like, but before I was here, you gotta go. This is bad.
3687860	3692420	Right. Right. I'm Bailey. This is me. I bet you're wondering how I got here. Is that what you were
3692420	3697460	trying to say? That's the good version of what I was doing. This is why you're a professional.
3697460	3705140	That's amazing. This is why you took over my billboard. She deserves more television
3705140	3716100	than you. No, that's what I said. I got great applause. It was great. Timor. Timor. Timor.
3716100	3723300	Timor. It's T-I-M-U-R. Correct. Timor. I don't know. Some people get it so wrong. T-U-M-O-R.
3724020	3737220	Two more? Someone spelled my name like T-I-M-E-O-U-R. Come on. Come on, pronounce it.
3740020	3745860	So, more. T-I-M-U-R. But if we're just in a rush, we can just go Timor and it's fine, right? Timor.
3746660	3753460	If it's fine by you, I guess. So, no. Not a yes. I think it's, is it like it's Jamal,
3753460	3759140	but it's Timor? Is it like that? Is it like the emphasis has to be on the second syllable for it
3759140	3765060	to be right? You know what? I think technically it is Timor, but since he was little, everyone
3765060	3770020	calls me Timor, so. Timor. So, we've just gone with that. All right. Like Jamal. I was right.
3770020	3776500	You're welcome. All right. We'll get through this. One step at a time. No, we're doing it. I'm
3776500	3784260	taking ass. I'm so good. One of our early conversations that we had as neighbors,
3784260	3789060	I think was like, oh, my, one of my sons, he has a haunted house every how, you know,
3789060	3792260	and he's making it in the backyard. Is that going to be a problem? There's going to be people like,
3792260	3797860	I don't, I've never ever once ever, I don't think, complained to a neighbor about any, I just,
3798740	3803300	I'm either forcing myself to stay awake and play Minecraft and tuning everything out,
3804660	3810340	or I'm just like unconscious because I fell asleep against my will for the three hours
3810340	3815300	between Adderall's that it takes, you know, for me to recharge my brain and get out there and
3815300	3823300	just damage myself more. So, you're fine. But I could hear, so I hear your haunted house going on
3824100	3829300	at haunted house time. And there's a thing playing on a loop that I've like become familiar with.
3829300	3834020	There's like a loop, looped thing. And I kind of get into it. I'm like, I'm like, but you've been
3834020	3839780	doing this for years and you're steadily, you're, you're becoming one of these Halloween people.
3839780	3844180	You're becoming a haunted house person. I don't want to categorize you. You thought you were
3844180	3849940	special. I'm saying, you know, it's weird what you're, that's why you're here. You were going
3849940	3856180	to talk. I'm sorry. You're, you're, you've been getting more and more into your haunted house
3856180	3863460	every passing year. When did you start? What year? I started it for, uh, four, five years ago. And
3863460	3868820	so, and that, at that time, like how, how much before, uh, Halloween did you start making your
3868820	3874900	haunted house? I started about the first, first time I started was like a week before. All right.
3875140	3882100	And then the next year, well, I would disagree with that. Oh, controversy. Moms always win. So go
3882100	3890180	ahead. Not on Harmon town. You know, this is going to be the worst possible thing I'm going to say,
3890180	3894740	but Ria has a super early call time and I feel like I'm going to be useless in this haunted house
3894740	3901940	conversation. I'm going to go to my house so that my wife can go to bed at some point and I'm going
3901940	3908420	to leave you guys, but Dan, you have to take notes and tell me about it because I am neighborhood.
3908420	3913940	Just trying to avoid the argument, aren't you? The haunted house. What argument? I was not expecting
3913940	3917460	an argument to happen. I thought you were going to lay out all your plans and that we were going
3917460	3920180	to hear about it and that you were going to tell me your address so that I could come to your haunted
3920180	3925140	house. Uh, but we'll figure that out later because I also live in the neighborhood. So I'll see you
3925140	3930660	guys there. All right. Watch. Take my wife on. Thank you so much.
3935540	3940740	I'm not a bad host. I gave them, I said they had an out before and the, yeah, I,
3940740	3945940	that's not my fault. You were so good at hosting. I'm so good at everything. No, it's great. I'm
3945940	3951300	good at sleeping next to a haunted house. All right. So, so you, so the first year,
3951300	3954660	week before a haunted house, you threw up a haunted house. You obviously had a good time next
3954660	3958900	year. You want to make another haunted house. You started probably a little earlier, right? Yeah.
3958900	3966980	How much earlier? Um, one and a half. Okay. So now it's 2016. It's August and you got your
3966980	3971860	haunted house. It's like in construction right now, right? Yeah. And you got a bag here.
3972580	3977460	That is like, these are your haunted house plans, right? Well, one of the things that I would say
3977460	3986660	is that, um, Timor started his official, um, haunted maze. Um, and it wasn't even a maze at
3986660	3993540	that point because he was 11 years old. But, um, when I had my brain tumor, um, your brain Timor.
3993540	4004180	My brain Timor. Is that what you did? Yes. No, dad was going to work and I was sleeping all day.
4004820	4010580	And we were very worried about Timor and what he was going to do all day. And this was in the
4010580	4017540	summertime and you started building, uh, your first haunted maze. And it was, it went straight.
4017540	4023300	It was, there wasn't much maze to it, but it was probably because he was only 11 years old.
4023300	4030100	It probably went from here to that wall. And I remember that it went right up our sidewalk
4030100	4036900	and, um, everybody that was coming to visit me had to go through that, uh, little tunnel. So
4036900	4042420	whether it was a pizza delivery man or people delivering food or relatives, they all had to
4042420	4047700	go through that. And that was the first year. And what is that? So when you started, when you do a
4047700	4055780	haunted, uh, maze, I've been calling it a house, I, but it's like, do you, do you go to the front
4055780	4060020	door of your house? Does that, is that where the customer goes? Do they go to the front door of
4060020	4067060	your house and enter your home or do they go around the house? So my house is like a regular
4067060	4072420	house right here. And then there's a yard around it and, uh, leading up to it or some stairs. So
4072420	4079700	then down there people wait to get up. Well, the first year, the first year it went right up to our
4079700	4085300	door. Right. But then after that, uh, the next year he said, I'm going to build it around the house.
4085860	4092260	And we were saying, uh, tomorrow that's crazy because we live on a, uh, in a house that's on
4092260	4097140	a hill and to go around it, there's so, I mean, just to get up to our house, there's a lot of steps,
4097140	4101300	uh, our garage is at ground level. And then you have to go up a lot of steps. Well, see,
4101300	4108580	now you're scaring me already. Just know you'll burn calories if you go. Yes. And then to go
4108580	4113700	around the house, which is where he wanted to build the whole haunted maze, is there are steps
4113700	4119460	all over because it's on a hill. So it's actually quite dangerous. So you never go through the
4119460	4123860	boots in the home. You're not opening your home to strangers and like, like, cause you'd have to
4123860	4129940	have like people just like with knives would be like to protect you because last year,
4131060	4136020	last year with all the chaotic, I'm, I'm walking through my house and all of a sudden there's a
4136020	4141700	little old grandma standing there like, um, where's the restroom? Like right there. And then I'm
4141700	4144980	waiting there for her to finish. And then I'm like waiting there for like 10 minutes because
4144980	4150180	our random old grandma in my house, I'm like, effects it's this way. So here I'll escort you
4150180	4161060	out. And then she went, no, sunny, I'll escort you to hell. And you're like, no, my hubris. I,
4161060	4169860	I had fun imitating horror and now I'm in it. I mocked death and I am now it's play thing.
4170100	4177860	Uh, I should have known this is my creep show. You know what a creep show is? It's a vignette,
4177860	4183700	it's a horror vignette. All right. So, all right. Well, so I just want to show that I don't even
4183700	4187860	know because you started bringing this out and I was like, save it for the stage. Cause I just
4187860	4196100	want the, I mean, this is stuff that he did when he was 11, 12 years old, his haunted house file.
4196100	4204900	So you're, okay. When he was 11 and 12 years old. So that makes, well, maybe 12 or 13. That one's
4204900	4211540	from 2014. So I see what's in here is like, there's waivers. So those are workers that applied. Right.
4212420	4217460	Interns, I would call. Well, they're his friends. Yeah. There's friends. Yeah. And I think we all
4217460	4225780	know the difference. That's, that's, that's a cash register not opening. Yes. Let's face it.
4226100	4230260	Let's talk about that. Okay. Let's talk about that. Are people paying, what are they, they
4230260	4234020	giving you a buck at the door? What are they, what did, what's the, where's, where's the wheels
4234020	4239220	getting greased here? We actually go buy donations at the end. So if they liked it or got scared. Oh,
4239220	4243300	I like it at the end. That's nice. Yeah. We have a donation booth at the bottom of the stairs that
4243300	4250260	says donations and that's actually a booth. So like on some nights we'll have a person waiting
4250260	4256180	in the booth. Like last year we had a clown theme. So we'd have like a clown in there,
4256180	4261300	a person that looked fake. And then after someone put a donation in, they'd move. So.
4263380	4267140	All right. Well, that's yeah. So, okay. So it's all on donations. So then you take that and you,
4267140	4271300	what, do you put it all into the haunted house or? Yeah, it actually goes back to all the money we
4271300	4277300	spent on the house. I see a map here. It's just a bunch of quadrants and it says plastic. Well,
4277860	4284820	they, they, and there's a drawing of dismembered arms. The thing I wanted to point out where these
4284820	4292500	were all things that he had. Just ideas. Are those boobs or pencils? But these are things that he
4292500	4297700	did when he was 11 or 12 years old. Those are teeth, but in your perspective, I could see how
4297700	4306820	those look like boobs. Yeah. Well, it's called misogyny. She uses that to consume me.
4307860	4310180	Whoa.
4312820	4317220	It's Smith. It's deep, man. All right. I just want, I don't know. It's a stack of things.
4317220	4322500	So, Tamora is 16 years old now. That was one of the things I wanted to point out. And he started
4322500	4328420	this when he was 11. Right. So, so, and I, this is the thing that I like about it. I, because you
4328420	4332900	need my approval. But I like that you said, you said, oh, my son's going to do a haunted house,
4332980	4338740	you know, and, and, and like, okay. And I like it. I mean, it's neat. It's cool that you're like,
4338740	4343300	you're into it. And you keep putting more and more energy into it. And you might get,
4343300	4349140	next year might be the year that you're like, oh, haunted houses are dumb. Or, but more than likely,
4349140	4353700	some kind of weird morph is going to happen where you're like, oh, you know what I really like about
4353700	4358500	haunted houses? You know what I'm doing? And there might be some weird offshoot of that.
4358500	4364420	Or you may be one of the lucky people that's like, and I found out I love you, you, you're,
4364420	4370900	it'll be 2048. And you'll be like, I'm the master of haunted houses, or just this one.
4371460	4375620	I want to ask you, like, what do you think? And there's no, there's no wrong answer to it. Just
4375620	4381460	like the most dumb, like, like, like childish caveman answer that you want to give, like, what,
4381460	4385780	what do you, what do you, what's the pleasure? Like, what, what draws you back to it? What,
4385780	4389220	what do you really get out of the whole experience of making a haunted house and
4389220	4395780	having people come through it? Well, it's a community thing that happens. So all the neighbors
4395780	4401140	come. And then from actually six to seven p.m. is the less scary version for little kids,
4401140	4406180	like her age. Oh, they go through. See, can I, you, I think you guys invited me to that one,
4406180	4415380	right? Most likely. You know, there, but, you know, all the neighbors do get involved. And there is
4415380	4421700	a lot of generations. So we have little kids like you that are working the haunted maze. And
4423140	4428500	tomorrow's got his friends, probably like four year old girls are the easiest, like, like haunted
4428500	4432980	house worker of the world. They could just put an Easter dress on them and have them just stand and
4432980	4438420	stare. As long as they could just hold still for like an hour. Like, that's probably the most
4438420	4448180	terrifying thing they beckon with a lace glove. They're like holding something random, not like
4448180	4453620	a bloody knife, because it's over the top. Like they're just holding like an apple or, or like a
4453620	4462900	gerbil or a football with like, with like a pentagram on it. I don't know. You're not far
4462900	4468100	from there. Or like a piece of, no, okay. Scariest thing in the world. Four year old girl
4468980	4475380	in a nightgown holding a, an O-ring from a space shuttle. Oh, shit.
4477620	4482340	Think about it. And just, and just with a look of confusion on her face.
4487540	4490580	The face I have right now, because I have no idea what you're talking about.
4490580	4494980	It's, it's just, yeah, it's like, it's like a, like, or just like, let me, let me, let me
4494980	4499140	re-pitch that. Like, like, that's what I would project onto it. If it was like a girl holding
4499140	4506260	like a piece of, it was clearly like a piece of like crucial aeronautic equipment. You know what
4506260	4510420	I'm saying? It's like some dark, dark shit. The idea is that a bunch of people are going to die
4510420	4514100	because of this child. Just something specific. It's like, that girl's not supposed to be holding
4514100	4518980	that. And like, what is that? It's like a big nut, you know, like a, like a, like an industrial
4518980	4523140	sized, like washer that's like rusty or something. And she's just holding it up and going like,
4523940	4529540	and you're like, where did you get that? And then you just hear this huge crash.
4531620	4537060	That's, that's terror. Like, like, like, like, you should, you can use that. Like, like,
4538180	4544260	I'll take that into consideration. But aside from it being, because if you, if you just wanted to do
4544260	4548820	community stuff and that's great, like, like, you're very, you know, that's, that's a, that's a
4548820	4553140	good answer. And I'm not saying it's an insincere one. It's part, it's, you like, you like contribute,
4553140	4557940	you like contributing. Like they, like you like the feeling of like the neighborhood is like,
4557940	4562100	there's a tradition and they're coming over and you're like, you're, you're, you're doing this
4562100	4566100	thing that people know, oh, there's Timmer. He's the guy that does that haunted house thing every
4566100	4570820	year. And it's like consistency and tradition. And you have this role, like I'm the shoemaker.
4570820	4575380	I'm the, I'm the, I'm the barber. I'm the guy that saves your life. I'm the light, you know,
4575380	4582820	like, like whatever that you have, you have this role. And, but now just a subset of that, it,
4582820	4587220	the terror thing, the horror thing, the idea, because you could do that with Christmas. You
4587220	4591380	could do that with, you know, you could do that with Easter. You could do that with no holiday at
4591380	4595540	all. You could do that with like a bicycle race around here. You could organize like a marathon
4595540	4600180	where everyone walked on their hands and the proceeds went to the next year's marathon,
4600180	4606660	like you're, you, you, you, people being scared. Does that, does that, like, do you like that?
4608580	4614420	That's the first question I've ever got asked by someone. Your guides counselor should have been
4614420	4621940	the first. He should have said, do you like scaring people, Timmer? No comment.
4622900	4626100	Well, do you like, uh, do you like a good night's sleep?
4627860	4634180	Who doesn't? Yeah. No, who doesn't is right. Let me tell you something about Casper mattresses.
4636580	4642020	Casper is an obsessively, an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly low price.
4642020	4645060	Now as a, as a cool kid, does that appeal to you in any way?
4645060	4654180	Uh, not really. No, you're right. It's not appealing to kids. This is engineer stuff.
4654180	4658660	But what about the fact that it combines spring latex and supportive memory foam
4658660	4663060	to create an award-winning sleep surface with just the right sink and just the right bounce?
4665380	4670180	Yeah. A hundred day guarantee. You can try it out for a hundred nights. If you don't like it,
4670180	4673540	bring it back for free. We don't care. Wait a minute. Are you telling me,
4673540	4677060	and I know this is what people say in a commercial, but I really am like,
4677060	4684660	are you telling me crazy King Spencer that, that, that, that there's a mattress company that lets
4684660	4691940	you try a mattress for a hundred days and at the end of a hundred days, which is a mattress is
4691940	4695460	life. I mean, I'm like, like, oh yeah, that's like, that's like, like, you know,
4695460	4698820	the best years of a mattress or the first hundred. Well, I mean a hundred days is like,
4698820	4702660	that's like, like, if you, if you, if you try a mattress for a hundred days and then go,
4702660	4706260	I didn't like it, you're, you're, you have a right to, but you're lying.
4707540	4712100	Not only are you late on something for a hundred days, you can't tell me you didn't like it,
4712100	4716900	but, but maybe you're busy. But I mean, maybe you're just, you know, hoodwinked by the fact
4716900	4722660	that time magazine named it the best invention of 2015, the best invention in general. Yeah.
4722660	4728500	It's a mattress that won't disappoint. Now in a world where we've landed on the moon,
4729300	4735300	I guess the idea is like a slow invention year. Yeah. Well, no, it's the exactly the opposite.
4735300	4742660	It's actually the biggest invention year of a 2015 self-driving cars, artificial intelligence,
4742660	4749780	Casper mattress, Dan, they ship anywhere in us in Canada. I got one. It came in this box,
4749780	4754820	the size of a mini fridge. I accidentally cut it open. It was full of gold coins.
4755700	4761140	It's a $2,000 value just hidden away in a mattress. All right. Wait a minute. Is that,
4761140	4764740	is that allowed? I mean, I'm not saying that's normal, but that's just my experience.
4766580	4773780	Oh, okay. Yeah. I, I, I got a, I got a, I got a Casper mattress and, and all of our
4773780	4779540	immigration problems were solved. Whoa. Now we can't say that's connected. No, no,
4779540	4785140	but it just, it did. Think about it. It did happen. Sorry, Tim. We all have a donation box
4785140	4791300	at the end of the, here's the upshot tomorrow. If you use the promo code Harman at checkout
4791300	4797860	at a Casper mattress.com, you can get $50 off. Yeah. $50 off of a hundred day guarantee of a
4797860	4803780	free mattress. Now that's a good night's sleep. That's also the best invention of 2015. Wow.
4803780	4814020	Casper, uh, the first name in, in, in, in softness now in ghosts and mattresses. Yeah.
4814020	4818660	That's Casper.com slash Harman, Casper.com slash Harman over. Okay. We're done.
4819540	4826100	Slash Harman, not Harman. So what's your favorite ghosty Timor? Do you like goblins?
4826100	4836900	You like grim reapers? I'm partial to gnolls. Once again, no comment. Okay. I mean, it's weird
4836900	4843220	to plead the fifth in an interview, but I don't know which you, I don't know which footage you
4843220	4847620	watched before you came here. These, these PR lawyers these days, they're getting in early,
4847620	4852180	but okay. Here, here's a, here's a question for you. All right. So, so you're like the,
4853060	4858020	the pit boss at these things, like at a casino, you know, like, uh, like you're, you're running
4858020	4862660	the whole, the whole thing. Like you're, it's a Timor production. Like you're, you're top dog,
4862660	4870260	right? No, no, my parents are so millennial. All right. Well, well, let me tell you a story about
4870260	4877940	that. Um, uh, I gave birth to him, so animal and couldn't get away with killing him. So I dominate
4877940	4885140	his life. And this is his thing. And of course we have the ultimate say, but, um, you know, it's
4885140	4891780	like when he invited all of his school friends to help out and he was probably like what 13 or 14.
4891780	4896740	And, um, his friends, it was supposed to be something that they were, uh, it's going to be
4896740	4901780	something cool and fun that they do together. But then at a certain point, because Timor takes his
4901780	4908660	haunted maze so seriously, they started, um, accusing him of being really bossy. Uh-huh. And,
4909940	4913780	you know, heavy lies, the crown, my friend, this is why he's no commenting.
4914420	4922740	His enemies are looking for a weakness at one point. Yeah, at one point they started to revolt
4923860	4929540	and they said they weren't going to put up with it anymore. And they started to have a skateboard
4929540	4937620	party down in a cul-de-sac. Season four. And of course he came up to me extremely frustrated
4937620	4944580	because he wanted his friends to be there helping him and they weren't going to have any more of it.
4945140	4950340	So, um, at that point, um. Did they do a Muppet episode? Yeah.
4950340	4961300	You don't, you don't know how much I share this. Yes. Yeah. I'll bet. So at that point, um,
4962020	4968340	I went down there and, you know, called them up and they were looking at me like, you know,
4968340	4972420	what are you going to do about it? Holy shit. This is crazy. Cause it's like,
4972420	4976740	that's, that's a, it's a haunted house. And then it's like, this is really scary.
4976740	4981300	Yes. Yes. It's scary. How not scary they're big. Yeah. They're like, they're literally,
4981300	4985780	it's like, this is like a purge anarchy. Yes. Like they've got like skulls on their heads and
4985780	4990900	they're like skateboarding. They're not doing things to alarm people. And then Timor said that
4990900	4997940	he wanted to fire them and they said, you can't fire us. We're working for free. Whoa. And so
4997940	5006260	he said that he would pay them so he could fire them. Nice. I can't, this is just like humanity
5006260	5010900	thinks we have so many levels of sophistication and that is just, that's, that's global politics
5010900	5016900	played out. Just like, exactly. So, oh, okay. You're, you're, you're a territory.
5018420	5023380	So at that point, I mean, I kind of asked the guys, I said, let me ask you something. I said,
5023380	5028020	do you guys want to be a part of something that's really cool or something that's a part, uh,
5028020	5032100	something that's just really, really lame? I said, cause you're going to go back to your friends
5032100	5037620	and they're going to ask you, they're going to say, man, that haunted maze was really lame.
5037620	5043140	Or they're going to say, that was really cool. I didn't understand it for us. I thought you were
5043140	5049300	going a different direction, but that's a lot more encouraging. It's positive, you know? And so that,
5049300	5054020	at that point they said, we want to be a part of something that's really cool. And I said, you know,
5054020	5058420	well, Timor's getting really frustrated because he's trying to make this really cool and he's not
5058420	5064180	getting any help from you. So then at that point, they all kind of rallied around and they, um,
5064900	5071060	you know, started helping Timor. But, um, so that's, you know, a typical teenage
5071780	5080100	thing. But it sounds like mainly you went through it. Like he was, he was practically in tears.
5080980	5084420	So I doubt that. I'm sure it was fine.
5086580	5090660	He's probably used to that. He's watching this all with a cocktail, watching a window,
5090660	5096980	like Bruce Wayne. Yes. Let her have it mother. Well, these are all, these are all his best friends.
5098500	5101860	Morgan Freeman comes in and goes, sir, we found a new way to scare people.
5103300	5107940	Let's take a look. Lucius. Where's your mother? She's out talking to the riffraff.
5110820	5115540	Well, here's what I was going to ask you. So you're, you're, you're the boss and, and, and,
5115540	5119860	and I, I get it now, like saying yes to that is like, yeah, of course you gotta, you gotta,
5119860	5125140	you gotta say, well, you know, a creator is a myth. Really. It's a collaboration. I get it.
5129860	5135620	But, um, the, the, the, uh, goddamn it. I'm always distracting myself. Uh,
5135620	5138900	when you, when the show is actually going, when the thing is running full swing,
5139540	5144100	what do you prefer to do? Do you walk around like Robert De Niro and casino, like observing,
5144100	5150500	or do you actually immerse yourself in like one jack-o'-lantern? Well, well, I'll stand in the
5150500	5156820	front in the beginning and then I'll wait there until my ADHD kicks in and then I'll go back and
5156820	5166500	start scaring people. Yeah. That's what Dan does. Except I, I, I give myself ADHD with a drug called
5166500	5176340	Adderall because I don't have ADHD, except don't tell my doctor that. Uh, but yeah, so you, so you're
5176340	5180900	saying, wait, so you go scare people, but what do you do? Are they, you just grab a, a dull machete
5180900	5188100	and just wander or is there like a spot you like? I just go to whatever spots open. So depending on
5188100	5193300	the night, how many actors, if we're short on actors, I'll just stay in and like help scare. But
5193300	5199220	for good on actors, I usually stay down until I get bored and I don't like, I like help out like,
5199220	5204740	oh, you're, go ahead, wait here or go, whatever. So surely there's been like, okay, there's been
5204740	5209300	some mishaps, right? Somebody, has there been complaints or somebody, somebody went through,
5209300	5216980	they're dissatisfied? Um, yeah, there's been a few of those. I actually remember the first, uh,
5216980	5222660	maybe like the third year we were into it. Uh, there are like maybe five or six of us actors.
5222660	5226900	And then I remember there are these little kids that came up and they came down and then we
5226900	5232260	didn't establish at the time where we could stop scaring people. Like, there was no, they didn't
5232260	5240260	establish what the safety zone is. So a couple of my actors, a couple of my actors start scaring
5240260	5244660	these little girls and then they start running down the street and we're in a cul-de-sac, so it's
5244660	5250180	like around and I assume like they're right after you exit, that's it. But then they start chasing
5250180	5255380	them all the way down the street and I'm like, and come on, these are little girls, six and seven.
5255380	5260580	Come on. Well, you know, I was going to say the other thing about running a haunted maze
5260580	5267380	is, you know, when he was younger, like 11 or 12 years old, you know, it was actually quite cute.
5267380	5272340	And people would say, oh, you know, they said, oh, it was really good. But then at a certain point
5272340	5279380	when he got older, it started getting really scary. And we actually had one parent who was
5279380	5286020	throwing a party and brought his whole party of kids to the haunted maze. And because that was a
5286020	5292420	year where it was kind of the turning point and things had gotten really scary. And a couple of
5292420	5298580	his actors chased this party all the way down the street and the kids got really scared. And the
5298580	5304660	parent came back and said, he goes, you know what? He says, I have a couple of girls crying here.
5304660	5310820	He says, they're going to go back home terrorized. He says, and you guys, you need to establish a
5310820	5316020	safety zone. But he was right. He was right. I guess he's right. But I know he's right.
5317060	5321540	We all hate him right now. Unless it was one of your kids. If we were him, if he was, you know,
5321540	5327940	if he was humanized, you'd be back if it was one of his kids. Yes. If he had a kid and okay. Well,
5327940	5335940	it was. Yeah, it was. And you know what? He was right. But at that point, we had to establish
5335940	5343140	some rules for the actors. Like you don't go down the steps. And you know, so I mean,
5343140	5349220	it's interesting because as tomorrow's gotten older, you know, and things getting scarier,
5349220	5354980	there's a lot of things that a person doesn't have to, you never consider when a kid is younger. And
5354980	5361300	it's kind of cute. You know, I wish it's a whole area I'd never go into because when I go to haunted
5361300	5367060	houses, it's usually it's like, it's a whole game of like, I don't want to, it depends who I'm with,
5367060	5371220	I don't want to miss out on stuff. And then but so everyone's going to do this thing. But I
5371220	5379060	genuinely like, I have a really low threshold. And, and I, you know, my therapist says, I startle
5379060	5385300	easily for various reasons, she gave me a license to be easily startled. Like, like, you know, and,
5385300	5389940	and like, I get scared, like, if, if my girlfriend's in the bathroom, and she's brushing her teeth,
5389940	5395060	and I go, Are you almost ready? Yeah, yeah, I'm just brushing my teeth. And then I'll like, go
5395060	5399780	and pick up a sock. And if I turn around, and then she's not in the bathroom, but she's in
5399780	5406420	the living room, and I hear her voice from the wrong room, I'll go, it's not even seeing anybody.
5406420	5411220	I'll just like, if someone passes the salt, and then it's where it's not supposed to be. Yeah,
5411220	5417540	like, I have this like visceral reaction. So what I'm saying is, because of that,
5418260	5421940	knowing that people are coming through, and they have all these different relationships with being
5421940	5426660	scared, some people are like, I, in my wildest dreams, I've lived this punk rock haunted house
5426660	5432100	where people chased me all the way down the street, because fuck this like March of Dimes bullshit,
5432100	5436980	you know, like, you know, like, this is like, you're an adult, this is like mind pop. And sometimes
5436980	5441460	you pay to get scared. Yeah. And yes, it's like Tabasco sauce. It's like, I want to burn my tongue.
5441460	5446500	I know it's not real. I want to feel like it's on fire. Exactly. And then it's like, my little girl
5446500	5451620	got scared. Well, you need a highway cone to establish. And then everyone's like, well,
5451620	5456900	you know, what's interesting is we have little kids that are so brave, and we have adults that
5456900	5464740	are crying. So, you know, there is, there is, I just, here's what I do. I just, I'll just like,
5464740	5469220	I yelp and like a high pitched scream, like when anyone scares me, like anything that's not
5469220	5475300	supposed to be where it is, I go, and it'll scare other people. And then I feel bad. And then they
5475300	5480420	scare me because they're screaming like, I stay away from haunted houses. So I'm gonna, but I
5480420	5485220	think it's a smart thing to have like the kiddie time where it's like, what do you do when you
5485220	5490180	scare a little kid? What are the, what's the difference between scaring a kid and scaring a,
5490180	5494420	when you do it, you have little kid, what are the, what are the, what give us some examples of
5494420	5500020	what kind of choke up on the scaring bat? A year or two back, we tried to do this thing
5500020	5504500	called the pumpkins in the goblins. So if there's a little kid going through, we'd call them the
5504500	5509140	pumpkins. So that would mean you don't scare them as much. But if we say goblins and the actors know
5509140	5514340	to step up their game, you're calling that ahead. We've got two pumpkins coming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It
5514340	5518980	is a nightmare trying to get it all figured out, but we stopped that and figured out the six to
5518980	5522740	seven. Yeah. That makes more sense because pumpkins are going to come with goblins, you know,
5522740	5526740	and so what are you supposed to do? Two pumpkins, three goblins, said three goblins.
5526740	5541060	The one pumpkin is like, you got it. That's exactly what happened. Yeah. Boy. All right.
5541060	5556980	So commitment is a theme. Terror, hierarchy, a weird fun blend of these phrases, helicopter
5556980	5562580	mothering and also, but you're turning them loose. Like you're letting them explore his inner Ted
5562580	5569300	Bundy. Like you're, you're, you're going like, okay, so you love, you love this, this haunted house
5569300	5574740	thing, but then you're like down there doing labor relations with for him. No, the only time I show
5574740	5583460	up is actually on Halloween. Do you, do you and Dan, her husband, do you, do you, do you guys
5583460	5589140	actually, do you go check into a hotel while he does the haunted house? Cause the sound or? No,
5589140	5595060	we actually are there because a lot of times I'll take our dog down for all the little kids that get
5595060	5600980	scared and I dress up our dog in a costume and you know, people show up with their little kids
5600980	5609380	and then sometimes I'll run the booth and play the scary clown in the booth. But and Dan helps
5609380	5616100	him build it sometimes, but really Timor and his friends are the ones that build all of it. And
5616100	5622340	what are the, what are the, what are the do's and don'ts? Okay. Creatively haunted house craftsmanship.
5622900	5631300	What's hack? You know what hack means? Like explain, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, uh, uh,
5631300	5638100	catch penny, pure aisle, 2000 and late. Like, like it's what, it's what the amateurs do. It's like
5638100	5644260	bush league, like, like easy shortcut. Like, like, like, even if it does get a reaction, it's like,
5644260	5648900	oh, but that's like not, that's not like what a good haunted house guy does. Well, one of my main
5648900	5653860	things is I make sure since I don't know how all my actors are acting wise, I make sure they all
5653860	5662740	have a mask on there. I'm not letting them try to explore their acting skills here. No, thanks to my
5662740	5672100	actors. So everyone is dehumanized and controllable. Yeah, you're an opportunity for body work. Yeah.
5672660	5676580	Well, yeah. Well, it keeps them interchangeable. No one can make an argument. It's like, look,
5676580	5683620	I'm Damien. You know, they're coming for me. The way I scare them with my eyebrows. Well,
5683620	5690500	you know, what's funny too, is that, um, tomorrow would get really, really frustrated because he
5690500	5697620	would, when a cute girl would come through the haunted maze, he would get mad because his, his
5697620	5701300	actors, which are his friends, would not stay in character. I'm one of my friends, like,
5701300	5707380	you're hot. It's like, come on, bro. Yes. Well, that is just another form of terror. Yeah.
5709300	5714020	That's the haunted house. She's trying to escape. Right. A haunted house with a glass ceiling.
5716260	5721620	Oh, well, I mean, they're 16. They're, I mean, yeah. I mean, I learned this at 42
5722420	5727380	and it was only to get, try to get, not get booed on my podcast. I wasn't because I was
5727380	5735140	a bald person. I just figured out that women have a hard time. Um, uh, the, uh, so, all right. So,
5735140	5739380	so that's, well, that's interesting. So that's a, that's a note. Like, don't, don't, don't,
5739380	5744180	you know, it's a selfless job, scaring people at a haunted house. Don't, you don't get to like,
5744180	5749460	uh, same would go for a, uh, someone writing a parking ticket or a judge or, uh, anything else.
5749460	5754180	You're an impersonal cosmic force. If you're not a hack, you're gonna, you're gonna stick to your
5754180	5760740	role and rev your prop, uh, chainsaw. And it doesn't matter if like a redhead comes through,
5760740	5765620	you're not going to try to impress her. Yeah. Well, I feel like if, if you're wearing a mask,
5765620	5770340	you don't have to be self-conscious that someone will identify you or something. So you have a
5770340	5781060	mask on. So you hear that kids? Just, just words they'll live by. Um, we all wear masks. But, uh,
5781060	5790020	yeah, yeah. So, uh, uh, okay. So what, what, what, what are your rules on touching? Uh, well,
5790020	5796500	I have a sign outside that says actors won't touch you and you don't touch them. Okay. So here's the
5796500	5802500	thing. Such a relief. Like, I, I, like, like when I see that, I'm like, yeah, well, good, I guess.
5802500	5808580	But at the same time, something in the back of my brain is like, well, but now, like, like, do you,
5808580	5814260	did you ever struggle with that? Did, did you, in your career from 12 to 16, was there a time when
5814260	5818180	that sign had to go up or did you, did your philosophy change? Were people like grabbing
5818180	5822500	people's shirts or anything? Well, I was never a fan. I know there's those haunted houses that grab
5822500	5828100	me or like feet or ankles or whatever. They touch you. I'm not a big fan of that. It's New York
5828100	5840100	shit. Yeah. That's where Dino goes. Like you grab their feet. Dungeons. Yeah. Uh, but so, so you,
5840100	5844180	you are never a fan. You're like, you're like, I like, like, but so what's your favorite? Like,
5844180	5848900	like, I don't know. I'm trying to think like, like, like, is it like, is your bag of tricks
5848900	5854740	primarily based on like, I'm walking and I can't see everything and then just a dude jumps out,
5854740	5860340	like from behind something. I hate to sound like a demeaning your profession. Like, like,
5860340	5864020	I'm boiling it down to something, but there's, cause there's also like, I don't know, like
5864660	5868260	hands reaching through things. Why am I pretending I'm an expert at what you do? You don't have to
5868260	5874260	come through, Dan. I, I'm going to come through, but with the, during the kitty hour and I'm gonna,
5874260	5879460	I'm gonna periscope the whole time so that it is so that if I, if I, if I shriek, I can sell it,
5879460	5885700	I can sell it. But, but, but, but is it like, you don't want to answer that because then you'll be
5885700	5894740	like, that'll be giving away your recipe. Eat the mic. Tell, tell us the secrets. Well,
5895620	5904420	if the darker it is, the better. So, if someone's not wearing a mask and it's dark, it's better.
5905300	5912500	And like, um, okay, let's, okay. Nevermind. Nevermind.
5912500	5917700	Jeez. All right. Hey, it's hard. It's hard to be up here. He's doing a great job. We're all doing
5917700	5927700	a great job. Thank you. Thank you so much. Well, also, also it can be kind of hard trying to get
5927700	5935540	people to come because we live at a, on the end of our very, at the end of a cul-de-sac and tell,
5935540	5939140	tell me how you did it. This year we've got something that will catch your attention.
5939140	5945780	For sure. For sure. I don't know. Are you guys really hurting for traffic? I mean, how, like,
5945780	5950260	that's the other thing. What about bandwidth? Oh, if there's two cars on the, on the cul-de-sac,
5950260	5954580	you have traffic already. Yeah. Right. But I'm saying, I'm saying like foot traffic going through
5954580	5958340	your haunted house. Like, are you really craving? Do you, how much do you think you can handle?
5958980	5966500	Uh, well, we have, uh, um, like security guards slash like, they help like when that
5966500	5971060	people come through. You can scare people. You can turn around a lot of scaring people per minute.
5971700	5975700	Yeah, I think so. Because if we're plugging your haunted house, we're plugging my house,
5975700	5979380	because my neighbor, I just realized that that's the scariest thing of all
5980340	5982500	is that I'm going to have just people in my kitchen.
5984260	5989220	But that's fine. There'll be fans and that'll be fine. Uh, but, but, but, but we thought,
5989220	5992820	we thought you could dress up as the psycho woman and from your window.
5994020	6000580	We, I just, well, that's something, you know, I never even like dress up like a granny or your mom.
6001300	6007620	Well, that can help me like cope with my, like, if I just played a part at the haunted house.
6007700	6013540	Yes. And then we can say, or is that cheating? Look up at you and you'd be in your window doing
6013540	6018740	this. I need to, oh, oh, like play it from my house. I can just like, I can just do weird things.
6018740	6022580	Like, like, like, like up at your window. I thought that's what you were responding
6022580	6026900	positive to. I was thinking about being down there and just being like a mummy that goes like,
6027700	6032740	you're talking about, I just keep, I just keep going. Like, I can't figure out my third act.
6032740	6038020	Bang. Over and over.
6039940	6042180	Fade in on the bang.
6044900	6052340	Daddy, why, why? No, shut up. It's for you. Uh, like, just like weird shit going on,
6052340	6059700	like silhouettes and like, yeah. Tell them how you would get people over to your haunted maze.
6060180	6067060	Uh, I had an idea one year to make cards, business cards. So we make them, design them,
6067060	6071620	and then hand them out to people at school. And then I give a bunch. So I have a bunch of friends
6071620	6076180	that come to work in the haunted house that don't go to my school. So I have friends from all these
6076180	6080580	different schools. So I give them cards and they hand them out to all the people at their school.
6080580	6085380	And then the word travels. And then, and then you had flyers, flyers, flyers. And where would all,
6085380	6092660	you and all your friends go? Stores and work people. And then elementary schools. And then
6092660	6097700	the other thing they would do is they would go door knocking, inviting people to come. So listening,
6097700	6101460	you're knocking on the door going, like, would you like to have a shit scared out of you? Yes.
6101460	6107620	I'm thinking Thursday. Uh, yeah. Well, I mean, well, we can, it's early. The point was to bring
6107620	6111300	you in early because I wanted to showcase, cause if it was October and I was like, this guy's
6111300	6116260	working on a haunted house. It'd be like, who cares? It's weird in a good way to be 16 and be
6116260	6121540	in your fourth year of this level of commitment to haunted house re you're supposed to be so
6121540	6126500	distracted by some of those people walking through there that you spend the next five to eight years
6126500	6131140	living in an existential vacuum and thinking everyone's robots and just going like this on
6131140	6136100	a typewriter, uh, doing derivative things, but really just fantasizing about like, like this
6136100	6141060	asphyxiation. Um, that would be normal. And they, and the, like, I'm listening to a lot of
6141060	6146100	in excess Phil Collins, James addiction and, uh, yes, uh, Sinead O'Connor like, like sprinkled in
6146100	6150500	there. Well, you know, one of the things that we thought, because he starts in may, it's basically,
6150500	6156100	he starts when school lets out. And so he would always, you know, I would tell him, I said to
6156100	6161140	more, I said, you know what? I want my yard for barbecues. And he would always say, mom, I'm already
6161140	6168420	behind schedule. So, you know, while other people are going to pool parties and barbecues,
6168420	6172100	tomorrow is working on his haunted. Well, people are living a normal life. I'm working on the
6172100	6179700	haunted house. When does business start? When does it go up? Um, I'm always bad with time. Me too.
6180820	6184660	Maybe that's part of the appeal is you're like, I know what time it is now. It's Halloween time.
6184660	6191540	It starts the first, it starts the second Friday of October. Second Friday. And then Friday,
6191540	6198180	Saturday, second Friday of October. Who's going to forget that? You know, we got some more,
6198180	6202820	we got some more, uh, bookkeeping to take care of. Steve wants us to plug something.
6202820	6207060	Can we do that? Okay. Yeah. That's Steve. You plug it. Come out here, Steve.
6207060	6218100	Steve texts me like 10 minutes ago. We got to plug this thing. You fucking do it.
6220660	6225780	All right. Well, because we, we had Michael Christian on the show in San Francisco and
6225780	6231700	the lost episode, the lost episode, and he was plugging an event. And, uh, I told him that we,
6231700	6237300	we would plug it. Of course. Yeah. Michael Christian does, uh, it's, uh, it's, it's friends
6237300	6243540	for benefits.org. That's it. Uh, and, uh, what, what's the event that they're doing, uh, in
6243540	6248820	November, they're doing a avatar, the less air bender and legend of Cora event in San Francisco
6248820	6254820	at the JCC. Um, the tickets are on sale at friends for benefits.org. Uh, they're going to
6254820	6261060	have Janet Varney, who's the voice of Cora Mindy Sterling, who's Lynn Bayfong Dante Bosco,
6261060	6266980	who's Zuko, uh, and John Michael Higgins, who is Verick. Yeah, man. And they're going to do it.
6266980	6272900	Yeah. Friends for benefits.org. And Michael, uh, like, uh, like he, like he, yeah, it's such a
6272900	6278180	goddamn crime. I, my French Madeleine, the inspiring went to the Bay areas of me. Well,
6278180	6283460	I mean, he has like, I think it's a relative of, of, of, of ALS or if it's not, I, yeah,
6283460	6288580	it's complicated, but it's like that it's not debilitating. And that, but for him, way more
6288660	6293380	congenital, like, like, like Stephen Hawking got to like hang out and party in college. And then
6293380	6298740	one day started to find out he had this thing that was like, like, like Michael's like, like wheelchair
6298740	6302980	bound and has this fancy like super villain wheelchair. And it's a, and, and he'd like,
6302980	6308660	his whole life is like, uh, doing this, uh, this, this foundation, this thing where he's coordinating,
6308660	6314740	connecting people that affect people with people that, uh, uh, with charities that, that, that can
6314740	6321300	use that attention to, to benefit people that need benefits. Um, and, uh, and, and, and he was,
6321300	6325140	he was there at the, I know it's kind of meta. He's, he's like runs a charity for charities,
6325140	6329220	basically, but, but it's actually well needed. But he, we did a show in San Francisco. It was
6329220	6333940	amazing interview and, and, uh, we dragged them all the way out into the woods and he has like
6333940	6338420	this crazy electric wheelchair and it was a real nightmare to get them there. And then we lost his
6338420	6344420	episode. Yeah. It was terrible. We really fucked up. We're sorry, Michael. We're making it right.
6346500	6351540	No, we're making it right. It's great. I did a great job. It's a great show. Everybody clap.
6356100	6360740	But I was just going to say, so like, because we're, I wanted to check in this early because I
6360740	6364740	want to, you guys should come back sometime in October because I want to know, I want to follow
6364740	6371060	the, the, the Howard Hughes journey of this like pursuit of haunted house perfection. Like I'm
6371060	6374500	going to check, we're going to check back in with you guys in October, right? Before the haunted
6374500	6379860	house goes up. Like preferably I'd like to, like, if there's a show before the lights go on before,
6379860	6384580	I don't want to talk to you. I'll take anything, but I don't want to, I'd like to not talk to you
6384580	6388820	after it's in full swing. You'll be busy then. Anyway, I would like to, it would be nice if
6388820	6395140	there's a show right before the big, like that would be nice. I want you at your highest level
6395140	6402260	of anxiety, like where you're like, I don't have time for this. Like I'm going to, I'm going to
6402260	6406260	ask you what's going through your head right now, man. How do you like your haunted house now, man?
6409060	6415220	And Dan, there's something I want to give you before we, before we end this.
6415220	6421380	Yeah. What time is it? Oh, it's time to end this. This is a great time for this. Yeah,
6421380	6425860	we'll go. Oh, did you want to do it on? Okay. All right. Yeah, we'll be a good ending.
6426500	6432660	Oh, this will be great. I don't do good endings. Oh, we're about to do a good ending. I had,
6432660	6437060	I had told Beth, I had the gift for her. Somebody had cross stitched the thing that said it was a
6437060	6443300	quote from the show, the eucalyptus tree show. It said, uh, uh, uh, I can't, now I can't remember
6443300	6454500	the exact quote to be, uh, to be honest, Beth. Oh, um, you know, we had to remove four eucalyptus
6454500	6460340	trees and they were four 100 year old eucalyptus trees and they were right on the border, uh,
6460340	6467860	between Dan's and my house. And, um, the, we have four, uh, four young little trees there now.
6467860	6473940	And this is a cutting from one of the trees that's growing and it's a little, it's a little branch.
6478180	6485300	I wanted to share it with you and it's, it's an evergreen. So I just, um, I thought, you know,
6485300	6491540	the four eucalyptus trees, he was going through his divorce at the time. And, um, this, the trees
6491540	6497060	were kind of, uh, an analogy. Did you know? Well, don't be rude. Aren't you going to drink some?
6497860	6506900	So anyway, uh, the, the, uh, some 6 billion year old organism has been drinking this already.
6506900	6512900	Um, uh, uh, did you know Rob Cordry stayed in the Airbnb that's near our place and he,
6512900	6517700	he's a fan of the podcast and he, so therefore a fan of us. I don't know if you know who Rob Cordry
6517700	6522020	is, but you, I mean, you, you should be excited. I'm saying you should be excited. You don't,
6522020	6527700	you don't have to value that. But it's cool. He's cool and funny and famous. And, and he
6527700	6532420	was staying at that Airbnb and he was like, he, he, he was like listening to those episodes
6533220	6537940	and he was looking at his wifi and it said Harmon wifi because he could see it. And then he's like,
6537940	6541540	wait a minute. And then he like looked out the window and there's like eucalyptus tree stumps
6541540	6545860	and like, like, uh, the one that you were referring to that's in my yard. Yes. Anyways,
6545860	6552660	that was exciting. He's on, he's on ballers, HBO ballers. There he is. He was on daily show.
6552660	6560820	Well, you know, what's funny is on those four eucalyptus trees, we had, um, stumps that were
6560820	6567460	really, really big because they were big trees. And at one point, um, like I had, uh, I actually
6567460	6574980	stood on this stump to give you some, um, brownies or pancakes or something. Yeah. Muffins or
6574980	6584580	something. Yes. And now then we had the stumps ground and we were able to plant, uh, four little
6584580	6590260	young trees and within the stumps or what I don't know, they, they were able to dig down like two
6590260	6594740	feet down below the ground. So you got little eucalyptus babies. We got little, we had a little
6594740	6600660	baby tree that was probably about this big. And now it's probably about four times the size. I
6600740	6607140	gotta figure, I gotta, it's like a joke that I don't care about my other tree. I gotta, I gotta
6607140	6614260	get this, this, this well, well-respected arborists number from you to examine my tree. Okay. It's
6614260	6620660	called, my therapist calls it self-care. Oh, okay. Like I said, why is your right eye, uh, red? Uh,
6620660	6624820	and I go, I've stayed up all night playing Minecraft. And she's like, it sounds like you're
6624820	6628660	not happy. And I said, no, I love Minecraft. And she said, but what did you do last night in
6628660	6632420	Minecraft? I said, I don't know. I was asleep. I was like, so you're playing Minecraft and you're
6632420	6639780	asleep. Um, I'll save it for next episode. Uh, okay. I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm self-destructing,
6639780	6644980	but, but, but very happy that, that, that, uh, Cameron and Ria have their show and that it's
6644980	6650980	doing well. And then it's, it's, it's good. And, uh, and then you're, uh, finding your, your, your,
6650980	6655060	your passion and you don't have to don't get tricked into it. You know, some kids it's like,
6655060	6658740	oh, I love trains. I'm six years old. Everybody keeps giving me trains. And it's like, you're
6658740	6662980	locked into this train thing. Like I always, I always worry about those kids. I give somebody
6662980	6667060	give this kid a turtle. Like, like, like, like, just, just let them give him an out. Like, like,
6667060	6673700	he's boxed in, uh, like you can, you're 16. So this could be, we don't know. It could be your big
6673700	6678740	ass like haunted mansion thing where you're like, I've done it. This is it. This is my Burt Reynolds
6678740	6684420	boogie nights. This is the one, uh, uh, let the death of this industry begin. And you move on to
6684420	6693620	something called like hospitality houses, hotels, where when you walk in, you don't get scared to
6693620	6699780	the, to the point where you're willing to pay a thousand dollars for a Bay view. That's an idea.
6700900	6704420	He has no idea what you're talking about when you say Burt Reynolds and boogie nights.
6705060	6712340	I do. Well, good. Cause a certain amount of clarity makes me a criminal, right? Uh, I mean,
6712420	6715620	I didn't say, and I'd never said anyone could bring children to the show. All right.
6717380	6722180	All right. Well, so, all right. Uh, Steve. Oh, Steve got this.
6724660	6729460	All right. Are you good? What's up? A wrap, wrap, wrap. What do you want to wrap? Yeah. Yeah.
6733780	6739700	Oh boy. And while we queue up the beat, he's come to some of us this Saturday. It'll be great.
6739700	6744020	It's a great party that meltdown does. It'll be great. Pull up the beat. Let's do it.
6748260	6754500	Do some hype man. Yeah. Yeah. Hype. Hype. MC Harvey at the house, everybody.
6757220	6763940	Hype. Here we go. Yeah. He's going to drop a beat. All right. Here we go.
6769700	6778420	Ham sandwiches. Two pieces of bread. That's where it is. In between with a piece of cheese.
6779060	6792260	I fucked your mama. All right. All right. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Itsy bitsy spider. Itsy bitsy spider.
6792260	6799540	Itsy bitsy spider. This beat is going wider. Yo. I got a water spout. I saw the rain come down.
6799540	6804980	And it tried to wash me out. But I rose on up with all eight of my legs. I said,
6804980	6810820	you ain't going to do this. I climbed up the pegs and now I'm four years old. But the world is mine.
