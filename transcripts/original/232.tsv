0	8440	There we go.
8440	20200	From Hollywood, California, at Meltdown Comics, Harman Town is now in session.
20200	21200	Spencer Crittenden
21200	39480	And the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harmon.
39480	41480	Hello.
41480	45720	Hello.
45720	46720	Thank you.
46720	47720	All right.
47720	49360	Well, we got a lot of show tonight.
49360	50360	Not a lot of good show.
50360	51360	I don't know that.
51360	53560	I'm just saying, we got a lot of guests and things.
53560	56520	I'm not saying, oh, it's going to be a great show.
56520	58160	I don't want to make promises like that.
58160	61280	But sometimes I say it's going to be a bad show, and then sometimes you feel like that's
61280	62280	a good show.
62280	63280	Who cares?
63280	64280	You don't know.
64280	67680	There's a big portion of our audience who hates when we have guests.
67680	68680	Oh, really?
68680	69680	Yeah.
69680	70680	What are they called?
70680	73200	The Tories or the Whigs?
73200	74200	Bull moosers.
74200	78480	Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, is you basing this on talking to them at karaoke
78480	79480	after the show?
79480	80600	Are you basing this on Reddit?
80600	81600	Are you a Reddit lurker?
81600	82600	I'm not a Reddit lurker.
82600	83600	Okay.
83600	85800	Some people say to me, oh, I love it when you have guests.
85800	87040	Some people say, I hate when you have guests.
87040	89120	I like it when it's just you, Dan and Spencer.
89120	90120	Yeah.
90120	95120	I mean, you know, and sometimes if we don't have guests, it's a bad show because I'm like,
95120	98040	I don't have anything to talk about and I'm sluggish.
98040	101000	Sometimes if we do have guests, it's a good show because we do have guests.
101000	104360	Sometimes if we don't have guests, it's a good show in spite of having no guests.
104360	106360	You can live by the guest and die by the guests.
106360	107360	Yeah.
107360	108360	I mean, who knows?
108360	112600	Sometimes people come up and we get to know them and sometimes they're a big dud.
112600	118040	Sometimes they're people, sometimes the people in the live venue, sorry, that was probably
118040	124200	vodka, not spit, but sometimes people in the live venue enjoy the people that come up and
124200	129080	people that are listening at home are like, fuck that guy, I hate him.
129080	139720	But let's spend this, let's spend this personal time before we bring out our guests wisely.
139720	142240	I want to ask you a couple of questions.
142240	143240	Hmm.
143240	145200	Oh, yeah.
145200	146200	Okay.
146200	147200	Yeah.
147200	150280	You became kind of Bruce Willis there.
150280	151600	There's a, okay.
151600	153440	So does anybody know anything about pee?
153440	164160	The, when it, a pee coming out of a penis, a human, a male penis, that twist at the, right,
164160	169560	right by the, is that because I'm imagining, I'm not a physicist, but that's because it's
169560	176560	shooting out at a high velocity in the floor, in the shape of a wall, like a vertical wall,
176560	180480	and then gravity is doing its thing and it's like leveling out and it's also at the same
180480	184040	time like coalescing into a cylinder of, of pee.
184040	191520	I think there's kind of two streams that strike each other and their combined force kind of
191520	199600	sends them in a spiral around each other until they land or like one of those water fountains
199600	204120	sometimes do it where there's two separate holes and they kind of strike each other.
204120	208200	I assume it's to get more, you know, distance out of it.
209200	212000	Hello Spencer, how are you tonight?
212000	214400	Are you saying that it's like the Coriolis effect?
214400	215400	Like the, like the pee?
215400	219160	It's absolute, it's absolutely the Coriolis effect.
219160	225680	That people, that people's pee, men's pee out of their penises south of the equator spirals
225680	230360	the other way because of the, the, the, the rotation of the earth.
230360	231360	Yeah.
231360	234760	When we were in Australia, it was like that.
234760	238720	When you guys, now ladies, forgive us for a moment.
238720	244760	When you guys have the comings, you know, when you, when you, when you, when you, when
244760	251680	you ejaculate, you, when you make, when you make your, your leavings and then if you,
251680	257760	and then if you, let's say it's a hot summer day and, and you're already tired and, and
257760	262480	so you, and so you just kind of like, you don't, you don't, you don't do any self care.
262480	267920	You just sort of drift off to sleep, which I, which I, which I did once in my twenties
267920	273200	when I was living in, uh, in Koreatown and I, I, I, I really, I just value my candor.
273200	274200	No, don't value it.
274200	275200	Hate me.
275200	280720	I, but, but I remember I was like, like, this is a sad chapter of my life was like so fucking
280720	286360	hot and I lived in this like little two foot closet in our house in Koreatown and I, and
286360	291640	I masturbated and I just passed out on my bare mattress and I had, I had, I had masturbated
291640	297080	on to like a piece of newspaper and I, and I, and I just put it over onto the side of
297080	303240	my bed and I just, I just drifted into a semi blissful, semi chronically depressed, sad,
303240	306120	like when do I have to move back to Milwaukee sleep?
306120	313960	And I woke up and there was just this like carpet of ants just like, and it just, it
313960	318760	just, it made me feel like I was in an Irish poem or something about like, like, like, like,
318760	325800	like that, that, that hos, hos, hosier song or whatever after the insects have made their
325800	331920	claim after the raven who's wet, his beak, I'll be home with you.
331920	334120	I'll be home with you.
334120	339160	I was just listening to Skull Juice with, uh, Dino's Tamatopoulos, they talk about the fact,
339160	343000	I did not know this, that if you leave your jizz rack out, that the ants will come and
343000	347960	that you, you're, you're like, I did not know that ants love, uh, come.
348360	351320	I think the ants that we get a lot are like piss ants, right?
351320	354520	They love bathroom stuff that they eat piss.
354520	355400	They drink piss.
356120	357800	They're a lot like Donald Trump in that way.
357800	358680	Imagine being an ant.
360200	363880	What a, what a, what a, what a life the ants life, you know, it's like, like, like,
363880	365640	that's what we really have to ask ourselves.
365640	367720	Like, like, what are we, what are we shooting for?
367720	368440	No pun intended.
368440	373160	Like, what are we, what we as primates are shooting for the ants and the answer there
373160	379240	to, to, to gather it all and take it, take, take every, uh, uh, protein charged flake
379240	380280	back to their brood.
381640	383560	And they've been here since before the dinosaurs.
383560	387240	And so in some, some respects we were tempted to say, oh, the ants have won.
387240	388120	They've won.
388120	389240	It's their planet, right?
389240	390840	Because they're not going to go anywhere.
390840	393640	And then we're going to come and go, but we're going to come and then we're going to go.
395320	396280	Cummings and Leavings.
397800	401080	Uh, the, the, the, but, but what kind of life is that?
401080	401880	That's not a life.
401880	406760	I'd rather be a super intelligent monkey that just like rises up and spits in God's eye.
406760	407240	That's a good point.
407240	407740	Yeah.
408440	410280	It's better to be a human than an ant.
411960	415800	I think it's, I think it's a bold stance, but I, I agree.
416600	417960	We're, we're with this.
417960	419960	We're presenting a unified front here.
421080	427400	We're the only animal that has a, uh, a philosophy, an evolutionary strategy
427400	431000	that is proofed against the death of this planet.
431000	432680	And also one that is causing it.
432680	437480	But, but we are the only ones I've, as I've said, I don't see any big plans
437480	438920	coming out of giraffes these days.
438920	441480	Like I, I, I was like, like, they ain't got no rocket ships.
441480	445400	And we're just saying we're the one animal that actually theoretically you
445400	447160	could blow up the whole planet.
447160	450760	And we'd be like over here, we're not there yet.
450760	452840	But like, I'm just saying we should be proud of ourselves.
452840	454440	We shouldn't aspire to be ants.
454440	458600	And when I look at, at our freeways and our public schooling systems,
458600	461080	I think we're aspiring to be ants and we shouldn't do that.
461080	461800	Our next guest.
462440	465640	No, wait, Dan, before you, before you bring out a guest, uh, real quick,
465640	467720	uh, point of order, uh, Spencer and I were talking.
467720	471960	Well, we should slow down the show, but before, before we bring out our guests,
471960	474040	we've been talking and we keep forgetting about it,
474040	476040	about starting a new D and D campaign.
481320	486920	Let's lay the groundwork right now for forgetting this rolling
486920	488200	because we have a million guests tonight.
488520	490520	You mean like in the interest of next week or something?
490520	491160	Yeah, next show.
491160	494440	Let's, let's talk about how we proceed with this now.
494440	497480	So we're ready to start rocking on this as we go forward.
497480	497720	All right.
497720	498520	Well, one thing.
498520	499880	Electric boogaloo.
502040	503880	Because I, because I never really finished my thought.
503880	506440	I know people at home are like, oh, he never got there.
506440	510520	Sometimes if you're a guy and you do your thing and then you've,
510520	514520	and then you don't, you don't do anything else,
514520	517000	then you forget, you go to the bathroom and you go pee.
517000	523960	And it's this amazing double, like, like, like Lego, Legolas, elven arrow.
527720	529000	And you, and you wait for it.
529000	531160	You're like, like, have you ever, have you ever had that happen?
531160	533480	And then you, and then you're like, well, I'm not going to,
533480	534840	because it hurts to stop.
535880	540040	I know smallest violin in the world for, for the, for the,
540040	542600	for the half of the gender that's destroyed our species.
542600	544440	But, but, but, but it hurts.
544440	545560	You don't want to stop.
545560	549400	And so you, so you just kind of like, you try to, you try to push through it.
549400	551400	You figure like, well, it's what, give me a break.
551400	554840	What could possibly be going on down there that could keep these two streams separate?
555640	558840	And so you put a little more pressure on it and then it's just like two drinks
558840	560760	and it's just like going everywhere with the toilet.
561640	564680	And it, I mean, it's really, it's pretty steadfast that,
564680	569160	that I'm assuming it's a little, it's just a little super glue from that,
569160	574440	that you made in servicing that selfish gene.
574600	579880	So you're talking about when you're close to coming, then it's hard to pee?
580760	581480	No.
581480	584840	No, he's saying, he's saying, am I that bad at making that?
584840	589000	He's saying that there was, there was still some, like some left in there.
589000	589720	Afterward.
589720	592600	You come and then, and then you go to sleep and when you sleep, it dries.
592600	593320	So you haven't done it.
593320	594920	And then you go pee and it's dry.
594920	599800	The tip of your wiener, the hole, I believe is probably just glued in the middle.
599800	600360	Right.
600360	600680	Okay.
601320	602200	No, that's true.
603000	603240	Yeah.
604920	605800	No, I believe it.
605800	608600	I didn't want to, I tried, I tried to be quaint with my language.
609720	613240	I didn't, I didn't want to get all clinical and, and grody about it.
613240	614520	I need, I need that.
615320	615720	All right.
615720	618440	So talking about D and D, well, what do we have to decide?
618440	619560	Like what carrying characters?
619560	621480	I mean, I will, I will throw that to you and Spencer.
621480	622840	Like Spencer, what do you think?
622840	623320	Yeah.
623320	623960	Just, just, yeah.
623960	625320	What kind of characters do you want?
625320	629400	I'm thinking your guys are, uh, your, your emissaries of a church
629400	631320	that was like going into strange lands.
631400	632360	Well, what's our platform?
632360	633640	Are we doing a Pathfinder?
633640	635080	Oh, let's just do Pathfinder.
635080	635480	Okay.
635480	637400	Are we allowed to like see, so why is it?
637400	639640	Oh, I talk to those guys.
640920	647240	I use my plus two cloak of charisma and also a scroll of fireball.
648360	649080	It was great.
650200	650600	All right.
650600	651080	Okay.
651080	651080	
651080	651480	So, okay.
651480	652680	So, so we're off now.
652680	652920	Okay.
652920	653560	So go on.
653560	655080	You want us to be emissaries of what?
655080	655480	Yeah.
655480	659560	So I don't want to tell the story of the story that I want to tell, but, uh, yeah,
659640	663400	you guys are your adventurers, but you're from some sort of church.
663400	665560	You don't have to be like believers of the church.
665560	669800	You could be like, you know, employees or contract laborers from the church or something,
669800	673240	but you're, you're, you're a team from the church.
674520	674760	Yeah.
674760	676360	So it's like book of Mormon.
676360	678200	It's it's yeah, that's what it's going to be.
678200	678840	Book of Mormon.
678840	684760	Well, I think I would, I would like to be a very devout, uh, I, I know I could be like
684760	689160	a hit man hired by the church or a, or a paladin that represents the church,
689160	696280	but it's like, it's all into, I think I, I would like to be, because I kind of, I think,
696280	699960	I think my thing would, I would like to be certain about things.
700520	702920	I would like to know exactly what I'm supposed to do.
702920	707400	And I'm not saying from you, I just mean like, I would like to play a character that gives me
707400	712760	the relaxing, refreshing, uh, thing of not being conflicted and confused.
712760	716680	And I would like to like, no, like, oh, I have a religion and I'd like to know what
716680	718040	the tenets of that religion are.
718120	722040	I mean, I'll make them up, but, but if you don't, I'm not asking you to write me a
722040	722360	religion.
722360	725080	I'm just saying like, I, that's the, I'd like to be a cleric.
725080	725400	Yeah.
725400	725720	Okay.
725720	726360	Great.
726360	730040	A cleric, a cleric of that church, right?
730040	731720	Of that church that we're talking about.
731720	732040	Yeah.
732040	732280	Yeah.
732280	732520	Okay.
732520	732920	Cool.
732920	733320	Great.
733320	736440	Is it possible to still be Chad the Fire Liker from the San Francisco show?
736440	737000	Yeah, definitely.
737000	737160	Okay.
737160	743160	But I was in that show, I was an elf druid, but I like your drawing that you made when he
743160	744040	was a gnome druid.
744040	744440	Sure.
744440	748440	So I might modify and be the gnome druid version of Chad the Fire Liker.
749640	750520	Whatever you like.
750520	751320	I like that.
751320	752040	I like it a lot.
752600	753480	All right.
753480	754200	Okay.
754200	758600	So do you want to, do you want to like roll us like, uh, attributes and stats and things?
758600	759000	Yeah.
759000	763080	That might take a week or two or something, but also I think maybe we should make Steve
763080	765640	Levy a character, but I could handle that off mic maybe.
765640	766280	Yeah, that's good.
766280	770360	And then, but, and so then we just have three dudes, but here's the thing.
770360	779000	Like gender imbalance with consistency might be better than like, we used to have Aaron.
779000	779400	Yeah.
779400	785000	We could use, you know, but like, I think what we all agreed upon after a while is that these
785000	788040	things keep falling apart because we keep rotating.
788040	788200	Right.
788200	791000	We don't need, we don't need, we don't need people.
791000	792360	We want to have consistency.
792360	797080	We want it to be like a radio show and then it's like, oh, here's another chapter of this
797080	800200	and everybody that played last week has played this week and so that we have that kind of
800200	800760	consistency.
800760	803320	It's also very common for when people are missing just to have them be missing.
803320	805320	That's, that's something that happens in games.
805320	806760	So we could just do that.
806760	810200	Well, but not if you didn't anticipate them being missing, I don't know.
810200	813800	We got, we got bogged down because sometimes Camille would not be here and then Dumorge
813800	817960	would be here and then not be here and, and, uh, Curtis would, you know, like come and go
817960	824920	and Aaron would come and go and then went because, uh, so it's, I think it's hard to
824920	828600	keep track of a weekly show when the, when the half the cast is never there.
828680	833640	So, yeah, we had a golden age when it was just like a core.
833640	838680	So like Steve could play a woman or I could play a woman, you know, but it wouldn't be true
838680	842040	balance in terms of casting, but it would be in terms of the mythology.
842040	844280	Oh, we could have like NPCs come up and be women or something.
844280	845400	Is that just pandering?
845400	849480	I think is it like, uh, well, well, well, just, all right.
849480	849880	I'm sorry.
849880	850520	I brought it up.
850520	851320	No, that's the thing.
851320	851960	I didn't want to buy.
851960	857080	We have way too much way too much show too much show, but we've talked about it.
857080	857720	No, we're good.
857800	861320	I'm moving forward as it stands right now.
861320	864920	You and I have characters, possibly Steve Levy, and that's moving forward.
864920	865160	Yeah.
865160	865560	All right.
865560	866440	Now let's figure out the rest.
866440	867880	Let's get on with the cavalcade.
867880	868360	Okay.
868360	875240	Our first guest is, is, is a, a modern veteran of the television directing trenches.
875240	877720	He's directed many, many episodes of always sunny.
878600	880680	He's, he's, he's done tons of acting too.
880680	885560	We can talk to him about that, but, um, uh, his, the most, uh, noteworthy thing is his,
885560	888840	his movie, uh, uh, fist fight is coming out February 17th.
888840	891160	I think, uh, it's got Charlie day and ice cube in it.
891160	892600	And, uh, uh, let's bring them out.
892600	893640	My new friend, Richie keen.
901800	902680	Did I get that right?
906120	907000	I'm so bummed.
907000	907720	I wasn't out here.
907720	912600	Cause you talked about two very important subjects and you pivoted amazingly from
912600	917480	pissing to D and D back to the double stream, back to D and D.
917480	919240	I'm passionate about both these issues.
920040	921400	I'm an OG D and Z.
921400	923800	I'm Gary Gygax first edition D and D.
924840	930360	And ladies, for those of you who don't understand the double stream, it's I, there's
930360	933960	women who are always wondering what's happened in there.
933960	934520	Right.
934520	936200	Why can't you hit it?
936200	936920	Yeah.
936920	940440	And you just explain, you really, this is something that's not,
940440	944760	you kind of just took the hit for everyone and got it out into the world.
944760	945880	I appreciate that.
945880	948840	But I don't want to, I don't want to just like hide behind.
948840	951320	Oh, my Dick was glued shut every time.
951320	958040	Like we also, we're also weird, lazy giants that can't fucking keep it in the bowl.
958040	959800	I feel like this could be your thing.
960360	961960	This could be a cause.
961960	965320	Yes, this could be your, your, you can really get in front of this.
965320	975320	I wonder if shorter men are more popular with women in terms of toiletry hygiene.
975320	981080	Like of a girl that went out with like a seven foot guy and then goes out with like a five foot
981080	981880	five guy.
981880	984520	Like if she's like, oh, Michael's so, he's clean.
984520	988120	He's so clean and they don't even really think like, yeah, it's probably like
988120	990760	size distance because size is important.
990760	995880	The closer you're hanging down there closer.
995880	996840	This is so exciting.
996840	998040	You don't have to be taller.
998040	999160	I'm almost six foot four.
999160	1003720	And when I'm at home, I generally sit because it's just, I'm too far away.
1003720	1005160	Another important issue.
1005160	1005800	Sitting.
1005800	1007800	I'm sitting.
1007800	1013080	First of all, blessed is he that can sit down as the Scandinavian poet once said.
1013080	1013720	Sitting is great.
1013720	1014840	We invented chairs for a reason.
1014840	1015720	They're important things.
1016680	1019080	But I, I'm going to splash.
1019080	1020520	I'm too goddamn far away.
1020520	1024600	Even if I nail it, even if I'm completely hitting the clown's mouth of the carnival,
1024600	1025640	making the balloon go up.
1026760	1031400	I'm still just, if I, if my reward for hitting the water in the middle of the bowl and not
1031400	1036440	hitting the seat is refractory pee or toilet water coming out.
1036440	1037640	You're very passionate about this.
1037640	1038360	I can see this.
1038360	1040440	I just, I want to do the right thing.
1040440	1041240	I want to do the right thing.
1041240	1042920	I'm a nighttime sitter.
1042920	1043240	Really?
1043240	1044840	I sit at night in the middle of the night.
1044920	1047000	If I got to get up, I don't want to put the light on.
1047000	1048520	It's going to be a disaster.
1048520	1052280	I only pee when it turns out I have a pee.
1052280	1055640	Like when I, if I have to take a poop and then I'm like, oh, I had to take a pee.
1057400	1060760	I'm a nighttime sit down peer, but I'm a nighttime stand up pooper.
1060760	1061880	I have a stand up.
1062920	1064840	That is a, you're a rare breed.
1064840	1065800	That's a mic drop.
1065800	1067720	That's a mic drop on the subject.
1068680	1069240	All right.
1069240	1070280	Well, okay.
1070520	1074680	So, so how did your career start, Richie?
1074680	1077480	Now that you're our new Hollywood friend, because you're about to blow up because
1077480	1079000	this movie's probably very funny.
1079000	1083240	We talked about, uh, uh, um, three o'clock high a lot.
1083240	1083720	I don't know.
1083720	1088680	Some of the older fogeys in the audience, uh, uh, remember this movie three o'clock
1088680	1090360	high that was kind of like this cult hit.
1090360	1092360	It didn't really like, didn't make a huge splash.
1092360	1093800	There weren't nine sequels.
1093800	1094760	I don't even remember.
1094760	1096440	I met the actor that played the bully.
1096440	1099800	I told you at a party at Sam Simon's house and he looked identical,
1099880	1101240	but I can't remember the actor's name.
1101240	1102120	Richard Tyson.
1102120	1102600	Okay.
1102600	1103240	Amazing.
1104280	1104840	Is he here?
1104840	1105320	What the hell?
1106360	1108280	I said that was really.
1108280	1109640	My name is Richard Tyson.
1111000	1112920	Frank Johnson from Johnson management.
1112920	1114920	Also, I was another two clients.
1114920	1115880	Sparkles the horse.
1117400	1117640	All right.
1117640	1118840	We're talking over each other tonight.
1118840	1122920	So that, uh, well, three o'clock high.
1122920	1129400	Also in an era of John Hughes movies where, um, there was a lot of hearts and a lot of
1129400	1133000	big comedy three o'clock high came out in that time and it was dark
1133720	1134760	and just edgy.
1134760	1137320	And the cinematography was so interesting.
1137320	1138040	It had more.
1138040	1141400	I remember, I remember seeing somebody talking about, you know, I don't know
1141400	1143080	directors, forgive me for a second.
1143080	1144360	I think they're very silly people.
1144360	1148520	I, I, they're confusing to me because they think about things I don't think about.
1148520	1153080	So, so, so when, when you meet a good one or one that understands you, you, you, you,
1153080	1156440	I grabbed them and hugged them and go like, please keep working with me forever.
1156440	1157080	Justin Lynn.
1157080	1157880	Oh, okay.
1157880	1159320	Go do nine fast and furious movies.
1159880	1164600	Um, but, but, but like, uh, when, but, but like, why didn't I talk?
1165480	1171400	So I was watching like Hitchcock, Hitchcock, like, uh, like, like, like he was, uh, he
1171400	1172520	fucked with you more.
1172520	1175560	It was like you were in the hands of a madman a little bit.
1175560	1178200	Like there's a, there's all these different ways to talk about directing.
1178200	1180120	Like the philosophy is in three o'clock high.
1180120	1185320	John Hughes, I think, I think maybe he, if you researched it and you, maybe you have,
1185320	1191080	but like he probably did things with his cameras and his cutting that made you feel
1191080	1197080	like you were on not only John Hughes side, but that John Hughes was on the character side.
1197080	1197800	Absolutely.
1197800	1202200	And whereas Hitchcock, for instance, and then also whoever directed three o'clock high,
1202200	1206600	like they were kind of intentionally going, you don't know whose side I agree.
1206600	1208360	Hitchcock really did fuck with you a lot.
1208360	1210600	It's what, I mean, you see a movie like psycho where you're supposed to
1211320	1214040	be on one person's side in 20 minutes and she's killed and you're like,
1214040	1215720	Oh fuck, what just happened?
1215720	1220920	And John Hughes, I agree, was very much very clear about whose side he was on.
1220920	1224040	It was the first time I was conscious as a kid in a movie theater, watching three o'clock
1224040	1229080	high of all these like weird, like dolly shots, like just kind of almost needlessly you,
1229080	1231080	it was like, Oh, that's a weird thing to do with the camera.
1231080	1234680	And apparently it was based on high noon, I assume, which I've never seen.
1234680	1238440	But the, because of the high idea was in the beginning of three o'clock high,
1238440	1244120	the innocent kind of like sweater clad, nebbish character, not necessarily a nerd,
1244120	1245160	but certainly not a jock.
1245160	1248760	He's just sort of a middleman in his high school biosphere.
1248760	1251560	And he somehow accidentally offends this touches him.
1251560	1252200	That's the big rule.
1252200	1253480	You can't touch him.
1253480	1257000	And he says something like they run into each other at the urinal.
1257000	1260760	And he says, I forget what he says, but he slaps him on the back.
1260760	1263160	And you know, Buddy Ravel turns around.
1263160	1263880	Buddy Ravel.
1263880	1264760	Yeah.
1264760	1267000	And he's fucked for the rest of the day.
1267000	1269080	And it was kind of like, that was after Ferris Bueller, right?
1269080	1273560	I assume that movie because the guy was kind of, he looked, he had a broader look to him.
1273560	1274120	Right, right, right.
1275160	1279080	And he was sort of a, he, I think the thought balloon above his head,
1279080	1282600	like everyone in the audience was, I wish I was Ferris Bueller.
1282600	1286040	But why is it that when I try to be Ferris Bueller, I end up in the crosshairs of the
1286040	1292200	most terrifying man that's this 35 year old senior who now is going to see me after school
1292200	1295880	at three o'clock and the rest of the movie is just a psychological examination of your
1295880	1298360	unraveling as you wait for three o'clock to show up.
1299000	1300360	But an amazing journey a lot.
1300360	1304200	Like I remember as a kid just being like mesmerized by that movie.
1304200	1308360	Our movie is nothing like that aside from the concept of there's going to be a fight
1308360	1309880	after school, but I love three o'clock.
1309880	1313160	I mean, I just think it's such a, it's such a movie worth revisiting because
1313160	1314680	I wouldn't have brought it up if I thought it was nothing.
1314680	1315480	Yeah.
1315480	1315560	Okay.
1315560	1316120	All right.
1316120	1322200	Well, well, no, I mean, the log line is very similar, which is there's going to be a fight
1322200	1322600	after school.
1322600	1325160	This just happens to be two teachers and not two students.
1325160	1330360	And, um, what happens along the way is, is very different, but, uh, it's a similar sort
1330360	1332200	of what the fuck would you do?
1332920	1339560	Uh, the difference I think in, in fist fight is even though ice cube goes a step too far
1339560	1345640	early in the movie, as you go through the movie, if I did my job and I hope I did your,
1345640	1350760	you might be on his side as he continues talking about why he wants to do this.
1350760	1355960	And as Charlie starts to be sketchier and sketchier in his methodology of getting out
1355960	1356280	of it.
1356280	1361240	So, uh, it's a little bit more by the time you get to this big fight.
1361240	1366040	I think my hope is that you're sort of kind of like, Oh, I don't know who I want to see
1366040	1367720	when and how this is going to go down.
1367720	1371720	Whereas I think in three o'clock high, you want him to get those brass knuckles and knock
1371720	1374200	buddy Ravel out as quick, you know, if he can.
1374200	1374600	Yeah.
1374600	1376200	Did you remember my bodyguard?
1376200	1376760	Of course.
1376760	1377320	Okay.
1377320	1379480	So I grew up in Chicago, all those movies.
1379480	1381000	I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago.
1381000	1382680	I grew up in John Hughes country.
1382680	1386920	They were filming Ferris Bueller when I was a kid in my hometown, my bodyguard.
1386920	1388520	Those were all the movies in my youth.
1388520	1391560	Well, I like about three o'clock high because I love that movie too.
1391560	1394040	But also it's, is it a play on 12 o'clock high?
1394040	1397960	Like, it's like, like, it's not just three o'clock high school, like three o'clock high,
1397960	1399400	but it's also like 12 o'clock high.
1399400	1401400	It's like, like, it's a war film, right?
1401400	1404360	Like, like, it's like, wait, oh, there's a movie called 12 o'clock high.
1404360	1404840	Yeah.
1404840	1408920	There's an old war film, like, uh, from the forties or fifties, uh, and 12 o'clock high.
1409000	1410120	It's like, like, he's at 12 o'clock high.
1410120	1413160	Like, it's like, it's like fighter pilots talking about, like, you're being attacked,
1413160	1414120	like three o'clock high.
1414120	1415160	I knew, I knew it was a high noon.
1415160	1417000	Three o'clock, three o'clock high.
1417000	1419400	Like, like, look to your three and he's up there.
1419400	1421480	Like, you have someone coming at you at three o'clock high.
1421480	1423320	Well, the focus is really on the time.
1423320	1426840	So I just assumed that it was high noon because I'm, I'm sure high noon is like,
1426840	1429080	oh, at noon, you're going to fucking fight.
1429080	1430440	But school gets out at three o'clock.
1430440	1431640	And so that's what I'm saying.
1431640	1433720	And you can't say, you can't say high three o'clock.
1433720	1435160	You guys are agreeing and you don't know it.
1435160	1435960	Right.
1436040	1437640	I want to step in and help.
1437640	1440520	I'm asking, I don't know if I'm conflating two things.
1440520	1441960	I don't know if that was an intentional.
1441960	1446040	I didn't know there was a war movie called, no one knows.
1446040	1447400	No, there wasn't, there wasn't.
1447400	1448600	He's fucking drunk again.
1450120	1453800	So I said, I said modern veteran because I was like,
1453800	1457560	I didn't want to say veteran TV director because then it sounds like you're 70.
1457560	1464680	But you're, I mean, the TV director's life is like very hand to mouth traveling.
1465560	1466280	Samurai.
1466280	1468200	Willie Loman style.
1468200	1471720	You're never, I mean, as a, as a guy who ran one of these shows,
1471720	1475880	you never directed a community, but you, I wish I had, but like the directors are like,
1475880	1478680	like you, we treat them like substitute math teachers.
1478680	1484440	Like even, even, even the principal, if I can call myself that treats them like substitute
1484440	1486600	teachers. Like it's like, oh, welcome shithead.
1487480	1488200	Get it done.
1488200	1489080	Just get it done.
1489080	1493160	And then they go down into the hot box with the actors who are on their 80th episode.
1493160	1494840	And the actors are like, I got this.
1494840	1496920	Like, like, watch this. I call it the Allison.
1497960	1501480	Yeah. Like they, they direct themselves if they're worth their salt and they're like,
1501480	1506360	they'll bust the director's balls and they make friends with some of them and they torture some
1506360	1510200	of them. And, um, but, but I, but every show is different.
1510200	1511720	Every show is really different in it.
1511720	1516040	And that's what's, there are certain shows that you come into and it's like,
1516920	1517960	they want your help.
1517960	1519800	But when I do, it's always something Philadelphia.
1519800	1521320	What they're like, what do you want to do with this?
1521320	1521960	What's your take?
1522040	1523240	What should we play with?
1523240	1526680	Just tell us where to stand, you know, uh, and, and we'll do what you want.
1526680	1529560	Um, shameless is like making a movie.
1529560	1531400	They're just like, go do whatever you want.
1531400	1533800	John Wallace doesn't even have the writers on set.
1533800	1535960	You know, the Goldbergs, you're there to help.
1536840	1537720	I'm there to help.
1537720	1538920	I'm sure Adam Goldberg.
1538920	1540920	I'm there to help his vision.
1540920	1543960	So in certain, they're, they're all fun and different.
1543960	1548360	It's really for me about point of view, someone who has a strong point of view
1548360	1553240	that I could, that I understand and I can help and hopefully be additive.
1553240	1556920	And there are certain gigs where you're there just to help.
1556920	1560680	And there are certain gigs where they need your help and it's always different.
1560680	1564520	And I was a private acting coach and acting teacher for a long time.
1564520	1566440	And so I love to mix it up.
1566440	1569400	When I hear someone's difficult, I'm like, let me in there.
1569400	1571240	When I hear an actor, Oh, this actor is tough.
1571240	1572360	This actress is really difficult.
1572360	1573640	I'm like, I can't wait.
1573640	1574760	Like that's fun for me.
1574760	1576440	I know I'm going to reach that person.
1576440	1577960	I know, I know I'm going to find a way.
1578040	1578920	I always do.
1578920	1581800	And it's like, that's, that's really joyful for me.
1581800	1581960	Yeah.
1581960	1587000	Well, with Chevy, the way into his, I've heard the story.
1587000	1589240	There would be directors that he would be like, is she coming back?
1589240	1589800	I love her.
1589800	1593400	You know, they're like, why does Chevy love that, that, that, that director or this
1593400	1593720	director?
1593720	1597640	And it was like, they, you know, they weren't bad directors, but they were just
1597640	1600920	like, they saw the writing on the wall and were like nailed to Chevy and like,
1600920	1602760	like, like, let's shoot Chevy out.
1602760	1605720	You know, like, and he was like, I love that person.
1606360	1612840	Anyways, but I did want to ask you, like, so, so you're, you're kind of a man without
1612840	1615800	a country when you're, you're coming in because unless you direct a pilot,
1615800	1618600	I don't know how many people that are listening, they're interested in working
1618600	1620680	in TV versus features.
1620680	1625960	No, like in, unless you direct a pilot, you're not really, you know, you don't
1625960	1629240	have ownership creatively or in actuality over that show.
1629240	1633000	So you are just coming in and you have like this really stringent period of time
1633000	1635800	to shoot your episode, to prep your episode, to shoot your episode.
1635800	1639240	And then you have like a little temporary office that's never going to be the best
1639240	1639560	one.
1639560	1642600	It's like, there's no potted plant director from last week has their shit still
1642600	1642840	there.
1642840	1646200	There's like, there's like scrawled switchblade carvings in the wall.
1646200	1650680	They're like, like, like, don't eat the beans or the cake is a lie.
1652280	1655720	But you, and then, and then you have to, you know, it's like, you're always under
1655720	1656040	the gun.
1656040	1659320	There's like all this shit, probably politically like trickling down and you're
1659320	1662280	not the line producer might show up on the set and say,
1662360	1665800	Oh, always you got to eliminate three shots and all this stuff.
1665800	1668600	So then you have to have this a clinical relationship with it.
1668600	1670200	And then you have to do your director's cut.
1670200	1671480	You have like a week to do that.
1671480	1671960	Right.
1671960	1675000	And then at the end of that week, no matter where you're at with that edit, you
1675000	1677080	got to go do another show.
1677080	1678520	Otherwise you won't pay your rent.
1678520	1679000	Right.
1679000	1685080	So I guess my question is how within that weird clinical morass, how do you find
1685720	1686440	the pride?
1686440	1687800	How do you find the empathy?
1687800	1689480	How do you find the passion?
1689480	1692360	It's like any portfolio of work or anything.
1693720	1695480	You do a pilot and you have ownership.
1695480	1697160	I have a pilot that I did a couple of years ago.
1697160	1697960	It's still going.
1697960	1699480	It's paying for my wedding.
1699480	1700040	Okay.
1700040	1703480	Then you go do an episode of a show that you really love the people on and you're
1703480	1708040	there to help and you're cool with whatever the show runner does with your edit.
1708040	1711080	Then you go make a movie and it's a year and a half of your life and it's all
1711080	1713800	yours and there's pros and cons truly to all of them.
1713800	1720600	So for me, I started so late that it's a miracle that I get to do any of it.
1721240	1724600	I didn't, I was in, I was a comic, I was an actor, I was an acting teacher.
1725560	1729960	So for me that anyone wanted my help to begin with, I'm one of those
1729960	1733960	unknowingly truly grateful people who can't believe he gets to do it at all.
1733960	1738920	And so it's a bonus when I come be a guest on a show and they're like,
1738920	1740120	what do you think?
1740120	1744040	And I find that that happens now more and more as I return to the same shows over and over again.
1744040	1748680	But how do you keep, how do you keep from falling into the sand traps of either A,
1749320	1752520	getting so excited about this episode of Sunny in Philadelphia, you're like,
1752520	1757160	this is going to be fucking amazing, but I needed more time and I didn't have more time.
1757160	1761160	Like how do you keep from throwing a shoe and knowing like, no, I need,
1761160	1763800	let me do, let me take the weekend in the edit bay.
1763800	1765400	Like I'm almost done with my director's cut.
1765400	1766040	That happens.
1766040	1772920	I mean, I'm lucky that the shows I work on are shows I really dig and I really dig the show runners.
1772920	1778760	So if there's a situation where I feel like if I could just get a little more time,
1778760	1783320	either I'll ask for it or I know they're going to, they're going to elevate it.
1783320	1785640	So why am I fighting?
1785640	1790280	What's frustrating is when a line producer understandably
1790280	1794840	is worried about something that I know you need and you're in the writing room
1794840	1798200	and you're not there and that's a very tricky political situation.
1798200	1799560	And I know I have to get it.
1799560	1802920	And then I just have to be difficult and say, sorry, bro, I'm shooting it.
1802920	1807320	And, but I don't ever, every once in a while I throw a shoe.
1807320	1812280	Every once in a while my best self doesn't come out because of the things we're talking about.
1813400	1815320	But for the most part in television,
1817400	1821640	I'm there to help unless it's a show like the ones I do a lot of,
1821640	1827640	which is no coincidence, where they feel they want my additive value.
1827640	1828760	Does that make sense?
1828760	1829000	Yeah.
1829000	1829640	Jesus Christ.
1829640	1830280	Was that boring?
1831000	1832840	Let's go back to pissing and D&D.
1833400	1837800	Well, why don't we spice things up by bringing some of your Chicago friends out here
1837800	1840040	or fellow Chicago natives.
1842920	1847880	As I understand it, we have, do we have, I mean,
1847880	1850680	this shit gets dropped on me like a fucking sandbag.
1851640	1853080	Not in charge of when shit goes wrong.
1853720	1855400	I'm only in charge of when shit goes right.
1856520	1857960	That's a nice, that's a good job.
1858680	1861720	I think that was on Harry Truman's desk on a little sign.
1861720	1862760	It's certainly on Trump's.
1862760	1866120	I mean, well, why don't we, let's, let's bring Dino Samitopoulos out.
1869720	1871240	No, you don't have to move down.
1871240	1874680	All right.
1874680	1877880	He's doing lines in the back.
1890520	1892120	Oh, you gotta be careful with those.
1896200	1897400	I'm in big trouble, buddy.
1898200	1898920	What happened?
1899000	1905320	I wrote this graphic novel like 20 years ago and you had an artist work for three years on it.
1906200	1908680	Hardcover and hi, Richie.
1908680	1911160	You guys, I was his intern in 1994.
1911720	1912840	It's a true story.
1912840	1915320	I didn't, I wasn't sure he was my intern.
1916520	1919480	But then I made him say, hey, can you read my script, please?
1919480	1920600	And then I knew exactly.
1920600	1920920	It was me.
1922120	1922920	It's a true story.
1925080	1928440	I made 2000, we printed 2000 of these.
1928520	1929720	And no one's going to buy them.
1930520	1931240	I got a fucking hobby.
1931240	1932680	I'm sure that's not true, Dino.
1933320	1935480	I feel like it's like an infomercial.
1935480	1936040	Believe me.
1936040	1937720	I fucking, I brought my guitar.
1937720	1941240	I'm going to like, I'm going to do like a little monkey tap dance here.
1941240	1943400	I brought Scott Atsted and Britta Phillips.
1944280	1944760	Yeah.
1944760	1945720	I heard a gasp.
1946600	1948120	They're way more popular than me.
1950200	1954920	You mean Pete Hornberger from 30 Rock and the singer whose name I stole
1954920	1955960	for the character of Britta.
1955960	1956600	That's right.
1956600	1956840	Yeah.
1958440	1960280	I was going to bring I.O. Perry too.
1960280	1961480	The other half of the.
1961480	1962440	Britta Perry's name.
1962440	1964600	Like whose foibles I stole for the character.
1964600	1964760	Yeah.
1964760	1965720	She's in my band.
1965720	1966840	Sorry about everything.
1968520	1969640	No applause, nothing.
1971640	1973480	Because they don't know what you're talking about.
1974760	1977720	I mean, you're late, you're late blooming, which is an exciting thing.
1977720	1979400	I started a band at 52.
1980360	1981560	It's a fucking nightmare.
1982520	1989240	Our, uh, we're doing a gig actually, uh, on Saturday at, at Starburns at, uh,
1989240	1993400	at super tight and my drummer, our drummer, it's not my band.
1993400	1996520	It's our band and the drummer couldn't make it because it's his birthday.
1996520	2000120	And he planned this thing, you know, in Vegas for, he said, whatever you do,
2000120	2002600	don't have a show on the 18th and now we have a show on 18th.
2002600	2007160	And so I was on Facebook and one of a couple of my friends who are married
2008200	2010600	and fucked and had a baby.
2010600	2015160	And the baby grew up to be 12 years old and now he's drumming on Facebook.
2015160	2017960	So I asked if he could drum and he's going to come and drum with us.
2021000	2021640	You never know.
2021640	2023800	Sometimes you wake up to a carpet of ants.
2023800	2026200	Sometimes one of them turns into a drummer.
2027400	2029880	That's an amazing thing about our bodies.
2029880	2033240	We just shoot out torpedoes that either.
2034280	2037080	Did you, were you talking about a carpet of ants?
2037080	2038840	Cause I talked about it on sculpture.
2038840	2041960	I just said that you guys, I just heard you and Dan brought that up,
2041960	2046280	but I just today was listening to you and Andy talking about how ants left come.
2046280	2048440	I did not know that they go nuts.
2049320	2053400	They like, they'll let me do an imitation of an ant just coming upon come.
2053400	2055080	Like, again, here's what you want.
2055080	2058440	Here's what you want to spend $5 to subscribe to Harmon town
2058440	2062360	so you can see the visuals of what Dino's about to do.
2062360	2063160	This is a normal.
2064280	2065400	Let's just say your come.
2065400	2065720	Okay.
2066600	2068360	Oh, he's going about his business.
2071720	2074440	Oh, where, where are the guys?
2074440	2075240	Where's everyone?
2075240	2075960	Which way do I go?
2075960	2076760	Which way do I go?
2076760	2079880	They literally go nuts when they taste the come.
2080520	2081480	It's awful.
2083400	2085240	Do you think it's maybe here's a theory.
2085800	2086920	Maybe it's because
2086920	2087640	Disgusting.
2088440	2094120	Ants are so sophisticated as carnivores that they can taste DNA
2094120	2100440	and they, and they, and they're tasting the sophistication of, of, of a, of a primate,
2100440	2102920	which is like, they don't even, their brain can't process it.
2102920	2108520	They're, their ant tongues are like, this is beyond a grilled octopus.
2108520	2109160	I don't think so.
2109160	2112280	I think it's, I think it's, I drink pineapple juice and it tastes great.
2113160	2115080	Oh, he loves pineapple juice.
2115080	2115800	That's this came up.
2116840	2118040	Ants love pineapples.
2119400	2119640	All right.
2119640	2122200	Well, we only have one extra chair, Dino.
2122200	2125960	So you, you, I understand you brought 17 people from your show.
2125960	2127080	They don't, they can't even sit here.
2127080	2129400	I got my, my, uh, drawing room back.
2130360	2132920	I want to, I want to help you.
2132920	2134600	You guys are both from Chicago.
2134600	2136120	We should talk a little for a second.
2136120	2137960	I'm from Milwaukee, which is much colder.
2138600	2139480	And shittier.
2139480	2140200	Yeah.
2140200	2141800	In general fireworks.
2142680	2148040	But, uh, you know, why somebody, I think a lot of everyone in Los Angeles that works in
2148040	2150120	television is, is, is from Chicago.
2150120	2153000	I wonder is what, what, what, what that is.
2153000	2153560	Second city.
2153560	2154040	Well, funny.
2154040	2155080	You should ask.
2155080	2156840	Uh, I have no idea.
2156840	2162840	No, I, uh, I was thinking about that too, because I, I grew up and I wanted to do
2162840	2164600	nothing else but comedy.
2164600	2168280	And I think it was just coincidence that Chicago was a comedy based city.
2168280	2173480	I think, you know, I'm just a goofy, ugly guy who got picked on a lot.
2173480	2175880	So of course I wanted to get a very beautiful.
2175880	2176680	Oh my God.
2176760	2177240	Come on.
2178040	2179880	You know, that's where I know you from.
2179880	2181240	You're, you're down here.
2183880	2185880	Thanks for letting me audition for that sketch.
2187720	2188920	I never fucking read it.
2188920	2191160	You sucked me off and I didn't even read your sketch.
2193240	2195960	When did you, you guys were, you're talking about Conan.
2195960	2196920	He was your intern.
2196920	2199560	I was an intern the first summer on the air.
2199560	2202520	I was the general office intern.
2203160	2209880	Uh, so this guy, Smigel, Louie, Louie with the trumpet and the gum thrown against
2209880	2210440	the wall.
2210440	2211880	And, uh, I couldn't believe it.
2211880	2213000	I couldn't believe I had a trumpet.
2213000	2213480	I don't remember.
2213480	2213960	He had to try.
2213960	2214600	What was that?
2214600	2216280	He was walking around the trumpet and he never played it.
2216280	2216920	He ever saw it.
2216920	2219880	Just, I don't think, I know he didn't play the trumpet, but he had one.
2219880	2224760	So he was like, had one day he spit his gum and he threw a trumpet and it just stuck to
2224760	2225080	the wall.
2225080	2225640	Something like that.
2225640	2227960	Were you there when we had the kitten running around too?
2227960	2229640	I don't remember the, there was a kitten called.
2229640	2233720	We were going to call this show night night with Conan O'Brien, uh, but they wouldn't
2233720	2234680	let us at NBC.
2235720	2238920	So we named a kitten night night and he just wandered around everywhere.
2238920	2240760	And everyone loved this kitten.
2240760	2244120	And then Max Weinberg came and he's like, I'm allergic to kittens.
2244120	2245080	And we had to get rid of it.
2245080	2246520	What a dick, right?
2246520	2247240	He was a dick.
2247800	2249320	I'm literally was a dick.
2249320	2250120	I didn't like him.
2250680	2253160	I had, he threatened to beat me up a few times.
2253800	2255560	It's that, it's that Brit set Bruce.
2255560	2257800	It's that East street band Moxie, you know?
2257880	2259480	Yeah, except Bruce had talent.
2261160	2264200	I heard, I heard that he couldn't even keep a beat.
2265320	2265960	Like keep trying.
2265960	2267480	Let's get a Twitter one tonight.
2268040	2272200	I think I will say with Chicago, I mean, I can only speak about my experience, but like
2272200	2277080	between getting exposed to all the movies, filming there, my bodyguard, the John Hughes
2277080	2282520	stuff, and having second city that you go to, it occurred to me that comedy was something
2282520	2283960	you could do as a job.
2284680	2287400	And it wasn't just something that happened far away.
2287400	2291640	I think that for me was part of it, but we, because you're a good looking guy.
2291640	2292600	I'll take it.
2292600	2295080	I'll take it, but we don't have anything to scratch my back.
2295080	2296440	I'll scratch yours, my friend.
2296440	2300200	Because I mean, I grew up in Milwaukee, which is like a smaller, I'm going to offend my
2300200	2301960	Milwaukee brethren.
2301960	2303560	It's a smaller Chicago.
2303560	2306600	It also had its own little smaller comedy community.
2307560	2312360	You know, like, so I have to wonder, like, okay, maybe if you grew up in a town of 200
2312360	2318200	people, I guess maybe you didn't grow up around comedy clubs and I don't know.
2318200	2322120	Like, I mean, I, I don't know what my point is.
2322120	2323720	Like, what am I trying to scientifically prove?
2323720	2327720	There's something in the water in Chicago that makes them move to LA.
2327720	2327880	Sure.
2327880	2334120	I do think second city, a lot of people came out of second city as like a breeding ground.
2334120	2338840	And I don't know why it might be like maybe people in Chicago are like, well,
2338840	2343800	I got to move to one of two bigger cities and I don't want to move to the fucking dirty one.
2343800	2344840	Right.
2344840	2345880	And I'm sick of the cold.
2345880	2346360	Right.
2346360	2346840	I'm sick of the cold.
2346840	2349880	I'm going to move to the colder, more complicated one.
2349880	2350760	Right, right.
2350760	2352040	You know, that's probably what it is.
2352040	2353720	It's like, yeah, forget it, brother.
2353720	2353960	Okay.
2354840	2357160	But Scott Atson is also from Chicago.
2357160	2357560	Right.
2357560	2358440	Is that, is that a good time?
2358440	2359800	Scott Atson, everybody.
2361880	2363320	Scott Atson.
2365080	2366600	Who's also from Chicago?
2366600	2368680	Scott Atson!
2368680	2370520	That guy's famous.
2370520	2372200	I've seen that guy on TV.
2372200	2374040	Also from Chicago.
2374040	2374360	Hi.
2375160	2377480	Sorry, I didn't want to out host you.
2377480	2378840	No, no, please.
2379560	2382280	Just you're an, you're an ant to my cum.
2384200	2384840	Help yourself.
2386840	2389480	I was going to make a baby with this one day, but I'll make more.
2391480	2393640	There's a lot of fan ants out there because of you.
2393640	2401880	I probably killed them because they can't get back into the pool.
2406280	2407640	Man, that guy jerks off a lot.
2409640	2410520	Hi, Scott.
2410520	2410680	Hi.
2411880	2414440	Dino brought you out to talk about.
2414440	2416920	He had a, yeah, sorry.
2416920	2419560	Well, no, no, no, I'm from Chicago and I moved to New York
2419560	2421960	because I'm more complicated than these people.
2422040	2423880	Didn't you move to LA first, though?
2423880	2424360	Yes.
2427720	2432440	But also, Dino, Dino, you moved to New York as well for a time,
2432440	2437000	and then you moved from New York to LA on 9-12.
2437000	2437640	Yes.
2437640	2440600	Yeah, no, first I moved to LA, and then I went to New York.
2440600	2442120	Paul's a travel day, bro.
2444120	2448280	Yeah, no, I, we saw this, this is a funny story,
2448280	2450600	we saw the second plane hit out our window.
2452920	2455880	Uh, luckily it wasn't a plane window.
2456840	2460200	We were actually in our house, and I was like,
2460200	2461400	check, please, New York.
2462520	2465880	And I was like, all three stooges, we'll get the fuck out of there.
2467320	2470840	I just love that concept because it tickles me so much
2470840	2473880	because the flow chart your brain goes through is like,
2473880	2476760	oh, you're not supposed to have that reaction
2476760	2478120	because that's cowardly.
2478120	2481160	Like your job is to stand there and get out a sword.
2482520	2483560	Bring another one.
2484280	2488200	Well, you know, people did help drag out bodies and stuff,
2488200	2490440	but you know, sorry, everyone.
2490440	2493960	But I had a daughter, you know, she was like two years old,
2493960	2496600	and we were really close, and we were living there,
2496600	2501160	and like the fumes of everything was coming,
2501160	2502440	and people were getting sick, so.
2502440	2504360	By the way, I talked to a kid in New York
2504360	2507000	who works for a law firm who, you know,
2507000	2510440	under the Obama administration, there was attention paid to this
2510440	2512920	because otherwise, you know, it wouldn't have been
2512920	2516680	not to suck a previous administration's dick too hard,
2516680	2518440	but it doesn't take that much these days.
2519800	2523000	There's probably people in Arkansas
2523000	2524680	that are Obama lovers right now.
2524680	2531000	But the, you know, his administration said,
2531000	2533240	you know, come on, there's been,
2534360	2536920	you got fucked up if you lived near ground zero.
2536920	2539320	Like asbestos and all this shit.
2539400	2540200	Anyways, I don't know.
2540200	2541080	Yeah, I got out of there.
2541080	2544200	And also, you know, I have this amazing little,
2544200	2548120	you know, carrot dangling called writing for Master of Disguise.
2550600	2552120	Now, Master of Disguise was.
2552760	2554280	I knew you were going to grab onto this.
2555960	2558280	A Dana Carvey movie about a guy who.
2558280	2558680	Are you kidding?
2558680	2560280	These kids grew up on that movie.
2560280	2561160	So you know that movie.
2564760	2566600	Do you know what's brought in to save it?
2566600	2568200	Yeah, I rewrote.
2568200	2570760	I rewrote 90 percent of it.
2571400	2577160	And then Adam Sandler came in and took my 90 percent out
2577160	2579800	and threw it away and put in fart jokes and bush jokes.
2579800	2585400	And I really, I wish I could show you my cut
2585400	2586600	because I don't have it.
2587160	2589800	And so you're never going to believe me that when I say
2590920	2591720	it was better.
2593400	2596280	The idea that there's a fucking masterpiece.
2597160	2598760	Version of Master of Disguise.
2599800	2601960	It's not outside the realm of possibility.
2601960	2604280	It wasn't a masterpiece, but God damn it.
2604280	2605320	It was kind of fun.
2605320	2607080	They shot your version.
2607080	2609320	Yeah, they shot it and re-edited it.
2609320	2610520	Oh, it's a disaster.
2610520	2611000	Yeah.
2611000	2611640	So it doesn't exist.
2611640	2613480	He had a friends and family screening and they said,
2613480	2614760	we're not going to take any notes from them.
2614760	2616280	We're just, you know, it's just a friends and family.
2618440	2620200	Every note they took, every note.
2620200	2620680	Brutal.
2620680	2621160	Yeah.
2621160	2622600	More farts was the main joke.
2622600	2623160	More farts.
2623720	2624840	One, one joke.
2624920	2626760	And I'm probably going to bury myself because you're
2626760	2628440	probably going to go, ew, that sounds bad.
2629000	2633800	But if you remember, halfway, like he has a little puppy
2633800	2636920	called the cuteness, which was not my idea.
2636920	2642840	It's a little puppy because I forget who, like Sony said,
2642840	2644200	we need a little puppy in this.
2644200	2644840	Ew.
2644840	2645560	Yeah.
2645560	2649160	So it showed up and halfway through the movie,
2649160	2650360	it just got lost.
2650360	2652360	And then the grandfather came in.
2652360	2652840	That.
2652840	2655000	And he was the master of disguise, right?
2655000	2656200	Sounds bad.
2656200	2656360	Yeah.
2657080	2657560	Yeah.
2657560	2658840	So I didn't write any of that.
2658840	2661640	And then halfway through the grandfather comes in.
2661640	2663720	He's supposed to be master of disguise and the puppy's
2663720	2665480	never talked about again.
2665480	2668840	So my idea was that the grandfather was there the whole
2668840	2669080	time.
2669080	2673080	He was in the little puppy costume and then he came out
2673080	2675960	and then at the end, they're like, we miss the cuteness.
2675960	2678120	He's like, oh, I hate dog food.
2678120	2678440	All right.
2678440	2681320	And he has to go back and be a puppy for the rest of his life.
2681320	2682600	You know, puppy.
2682600	2685400	And the big note was like parents were going,
2685400	2687000	don't kill the puppy at the end.
2687000	2687880	It's like, you're not.
2687880	2688680	We're not killing a puppy.
2688680	2689640	We're bringing it back to life.
2689640	2691960	I mean, it didn't make any sense whatsoever.
2691960	2693240	Fucking hate Adam Sandler.
2694360	2696760	Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, Max Weinberg,
2696760	2698040	they can all fuck themselves.
2701240	2702120	It's a big moment.
2702680	2703400	It's a big moment.
2704280	2705080	Someone's going to catch up.
2705080	2706120	I hate those guys.
2706120	2706920	I hate those guys.
2706920	2707960	They ruined my life.
2707960	2708440	What do you hate?
2708440	2709400	Look at me.
2709400	2711880	I got 2000 books and I'm not going to sell.
2713560	2716840	I mean, the views of Dino don't reflect some of the bridges
2716840	2718040	that I haven't burned yet.
2719560	2721880	I think there's like two or three of those
2721880	2724280	that I prefer to burn my own.
2724920	2725960	I'm almost there.
2725960	2729480	But soon I will have a box of 2000 books.
2730760	2731880	And I'll be happy that way.
2732840	2733960	And you should be happy too,
2733960	2735800	because you're a joyful life master
2735800	2736840	that everyone looks up to.
2737720	2738220	Thank you.
2740440	2740760	All right.
2740760	2742280	Seven people agree.
2743240	2745080	You don't want to be this guy's intern.
2748360	2750200	What's it like, Dino, sitting next to an intern
2750200	2751960	who has a better career than you right now?
2753960	2755560	All the interns, who's...
2757080	2757720	Matt?
2757720	2758600	Our intern on...
2759240	2759560	Mike.
2760120	2762200	Our intern on Sometimes Live.
2764040	2766920	Matt became a big writer for Cozbee, right?
2766920	2767240	Right.
2770680	2771160	Arden.
2771160	2771800	Arden.
2771880	2772280	Arden.
2772280	2773080	Arden Mirren was the...
2773080	2773880	Arden Marine.
2773880	2774360	Marine.
2774360	2775320	Arden Marine, part of me.
2775320	2776040	Yeah, she was...
2776040	2777240	She's doing way better than me.
2778120	2778600	Conan.
2778600	2779240	He's doing great.
2780520	2781240	He was your intern?
2782520	2783880	No, I think he started...
2783880	2784840	Wait.
2784840	2785800	No, he was...
2785800	2786520	Yeah.
2786520	2787240	I can't remember.
2787960	2788920	Where did he come from?
2789800	2790840	How did he get that show?
2797560	2799400	Is Weinberg still doing anything?
2799400	2800840	Is there a risk to burning that bridge?
2802760	2806280	I burnt that bridge when I was on Conan.
2806280	2807560	And you know, it's a little bridge.
2809480	2811160	And I think it was built on fire.
2818440	2819400	That guy's a dick.
2821640	2822920	What's your beef with Weinberg?
2824520	2827800	Well, he treated his band really badly and...
2827800	2828440	Tell the story.
2829640	2830440	Tell the music story.
2830440	2831240	That's right, I forgot about it.
2831240	2834520	I told it on Skulljuice, but you guys don't mind hearing it again.
2837560	2838200	Assholes.
2842200	2845480	Max Weinberg, Ben Stiller.
2846840	2847640	What's the other guy?
2847640	2848520	Adam Saylor.
2850200	2853800	And this fucking audience could all go fuck themselves.
2853800	2855160	Now, these guys are going places.
2855160	2856040	I don't know if I would...
2856040	2857720	They're already more successful than me.
2858920	2860360	I had to beg to come on this show.
2860360	2861080	You guys are just here.
2862360	2866520	So one of the Zappa brothers were on...
2866520	2868680	This is back in 1992, 1993.
2868680	2870440	And they wanted to come out...
2870440	2874600	I think Amit wanted to come out and sing What's New Pussycat?
2875240	2877880	And so Frank Smiley who...
2877880	2879560	Is he still there?
2879560	2880840	Yeah, is he still there?
2880840	2882120	Yeah, you could use your mic too.
2882120	2882680	Sorry.
2882680	2882920	Yeah.
2884520	2887240	He's the audience...
2887240	2887880	What do you call him?
2889320	2890040	The audience guy.
2890680	2893000	No, not the audience guy, the guest guy.
2893000	2893960	He's the segment producer.
2893960	2895000	Segment producer, yeah.
2895560	2897480	Dude, I was an intern on the fucking show.
2897480	2898120	You wrote for it.
2898120	2899880	You don't know who Frank Smiley is?
2899880	2901320	I just wrote the ha-has.
2901320	2901800	Okay.
2901800	2902440	Yeah.
2902440	2909320	So Frank Smiley knocked on the band room door and Max answered,
2909320	2910440	and the whole band is there.
2910440	2911480	And Frank says,
2912680	2913400	Dweezel wants...
2913400	2915320	Or Amit wants to do What's New Pussycat?
2915320	2915800	And the band's like,
2915800	2917400	Oh yeah, we love that song.
2917640	2920200	And Max stood up and he said,
2920200	2921400	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2921400	2922120	Hold on a second.
2922120	2922440	Hold on.
2922440	2923320	I said, Frank, come with me.
2923320	2925560	And he goes outside, shuts the door.
2925560	2926520	And he's yelling at Frank.
2926520	2930120	He's like, you know, I need 48 hours notice.
2930120	2931080	We have to make them...
2931080	2932680	We have to write the notes out.
2932680	2933480	We have to do all this.
2933480	2933800	We have to...
2933800	2935240	And as he's screaming at him,
2935240	2937800	the band inside starts playing What's New Pussycat?
2937800	2938840	Perfectly.
2938840	2941240	Like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
2941240	2942840	And just Max just...
2942840	2945320	That's the greatest fuck you I've ever heard in my life.
2945320	2945320	
2946280	2947320	And he's like, all right.
2947320	2947800	All right.
2947800	2949480	Well, I'll make it happen.
2950200	2951720	It probably wasn't even a fuck you though.
2951720	2953320	It was just they were that excited.
2953320	2956680	And he was moving that quickly to block notes.
2956680	2957160	Yeah.
2957160	2957880	He had no idea.
2957880	2960120	They had no idea he was going out there to say,
2960120	2961000	we can't do this.
2961000	2963880	That's because he gets money to write the charts for it.
2963880	2964360	Yeah.
2964840	2967240	And they got a lot of shit for it.
2967240	2967640	We know.
2967640	2969720	It's like, no, I write it because I get paid for it.
2969720	2971720	Like, no, we could do it right now.
2971720	2972120	That's right.
2972120	2974280	He got paid and he didn't write anything.
2974360	2978680	Jimmy Vivino wrote all the music, all the original music.
2978680	2979880	Max Weinberg had him killed.
2981720	2982920	How does the band feel about that?
2982920	2983560	Did I make that up?
2983560	2984920	Well, the band didn't like Max.
2984920	2988040	And when shit like that happened, Max would go off on them.
2988040	2990920	And we would talk as I was friends with the band.
2990920	2992680	And they were like, God, he's such an asshole.
2994760	2998040	And they're like, please don't say anything on a podcast.
2999480	3000840	Well, he's not there anymore.
3000840	3004520	But because I think once I brought it up
3004520	3006680	and it was even worse for them.
3006680	3011480	So I had this bit called Tamari the Ostrich
3011480	3013000	where I got into an ostrich costume.
3013640	3014920	And thank you.
3016280	3017240	You're my biggest fan.
3018040	3021240	And so I would come out every once in a while.
3021800	3024600	And just the whole bit was just like going out
3024600	3027080	in this ostrich costume and hitting people
3027080	3029240	with the head and the neck and stuff.
3029240	3032760	And one time when the band was complaining,
3032760	3034280	I said, don't worry, I'll get Max.
3034280	3035960	And I went out.
3035960	3037320	And they're playing this song.
3038520	3040360	And then this dumb ostrich comes out.
3040360	3041640	And I take the head.
3041640	3043800	And I start bashing his drum set.
3043800	3047960	And I knocked over cymbals that broke them and shit.
3047960	3050920	And then I did my bit and left.
3050920	3053240	And it might have been you.
3053240	3055320	Someone came up to me and said, get the fuck out of here.
3055320	3057160	Max is going to break your neck.
3058120	3059640	And I fucking ran home.
3060520	3065560	And he asked for my check that week for the Tamari
3065560	3069400	the Ostrich check, which is, you know, he's like,
3069400	3071480	he's not getting paid for that ostrich stint.
3072760	3074040	And he got my $300.
3074920	3077960	I would have seen him chewing out you in an ostrich costume.
3079960	3083080	I've yelled at people with the ostrich legs.
3083080	3085000	And it just stomped away with the big feet.
3085800	3088200	I remember saying to the head writer at the time,
3088200	3089800	it wasn't Smigel, it was some other head writer.
3089800	3091720	I'm like, you just settle for shit.
3091720	3095080	And I walk away in the boop, boop, flopping in the big feet.
3096200	3097000	Look like an idiot.
3097000	3099880	I'm not a musician expert person.
3099880	3103240	But I think if you can break cymbals,
3103240	3105720	you should get that money back from the guitar center.
3107160	3107880	They're cymbals.
3107880	3110200	Their job is to crash.
3111560	3112760	That's what he said they broke.
3112760	3113400	I don't know.
3113400	3113880	Yeah.
3113960	3115480	Come on, Max Weinberg.
3115480	3116600	Yeah, hate him.
3116600	3117800	He probably voted for Trump.
3119320	3120600	Oh, I guarantee it.
3120600	3122040	If he thinks cymbals can break,
3123720	3125880	then he thinks democracy can be fucked with.
3125880	3126760	Turns out it can't.
3126760	3127640	I thought so too.
3128280	3129320	I'm embarrassed now.
3130360	3132600	I found out my mom, my mom, my mom,
3132600	3134280	I don't know if my mom wants me to talk about it,
3134280	3136840	but I want to talk about how good it feels
3136840	3139640	when you find out that somebody that you were afraid to ask
3140280	3143000	who they voted for, you know, like turns out to,
3143080	3143800	you know, my mom.
3144360	3144840	I don't know.
3144840	3147960	I'm hard on my mom, like mythologically,
3147960	3150120	like I call her a lizard woman and stuff.
3151880	3152520	I like your mom.
3152520	3154280	She never raised me badly.
3154280	3155960	But when I got home from LAX,
3155960	3158040	like when I accidentally protested
3158040	3160520	by landing on top of the protest in an airplane,
3162680	3165720	and I kind of tweeted the play-by-play of it,
3165720	3167160	and I got home and she texted me,
3167960	3171560	and she sent me a picture of her in a pink pussy hat,
3171560	3173560	and it was nice.
3173560	3174440	I was afraid to ask.
3174440	3175560	I thought, I really thought,
3175560	3176760	I was very comfortable thinking,
3176760	3178520	and I just assumed my Wisconsin parents
3178520	3180760	you know, that they voted for Trump,
3180760	3182040	and I really didn't want to know that.
3182680	3185800	Next Thanksgiving will be way less awkward for you.
3185800	3190680	Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't really go there for Thanksgiving.
3190680	3195160	I guess I'm kind of, now I'm officially the bad family member.
3197000	3197720	What do you guys know?
3197720	3200040	You don't even know who Max Weinberg is.
3201960	3202760	And you oohed.
3202760	3204520	Like it was like, oh, it's a feud.
3206760	3207800	The mummies are fighting.
3211400	3213240	The bandage industry is never going to be the same.
3213240	3213960	You don't care.
3213960	3215720	All you care about is hatred.
3215720	3216680	That's all you care about.
3217240	3218120	Look where it got you.
3221080	3221560	Yeah!
3224040	3226600	All your policing of each other's language,
3226600	3229160	you know, that just set up those fucking 4chan people
3229160	3231400	to be like, my feelings are hurt as a Nazi.
3232200	3235560	They're making fun of us now.
3237000	3237960	We got to just beat them up.
3238920	3239960	My gun came today.
3239960	3240520	Oh, it did?
3241160	3242520	I didn't know you were telling everyone.
3243160	3243880	Well, here we go.
3246200	3248600	I hope the nice thing about a gun is that you never have to.
3249480	3250920	I should just tell everyone.
3250920	3251880	I have a gun.
3251880	3252680	Right, that's true.
3252680	3253560	That's true.
3253560	3254200	It works.
3254200	3254520	I know.
3254520	3256280	I'm not going over to your house anymore.
3257000	3258200	I'm going to put a sign outside my house.
3258200	3260280	I have a gun, and I'm not sure I know how to use it.
3261960	3265480	It might go off while I'm just weaving it around.
3266360	3269240	So, save me for last.
3269240	3271400	Also, don't be aware of the dog.
3271400	3272360	They're very placid.
3274440	3275800	And they don't know how to use the gun, even.
3277080	3278440	So, Dan, when you bought the gun,
3278440	3279560	when you said I'm going to get a gun,
3279560	3280680	what was the motivation?
3280680	3282200	What did you picture using it for?
3282200	3282700	Trump?
3284520	3286360	No, no, no, no.
3286360	3289640	I got to kill Trump that he was elected president,
3289640	3291320	and now we should be scared.
3291400	3292680	You just don't want to be a sitting duck.
3293880	3297880	Yes, it started with me being scared of general destabilization.
3299640	3301320	So, I had Spencer start researching.
3301320	3303480	Like, well, what do you do when you want to get one?
3303480	3305400	And Spencer did some research, and he's like,
3305400	3308040	well, one of the things I learned is 10-day waiting period,
3308040	3309480	okay, for a handgun in LA.
3311320	3314920	And then, during the first 10 days of this administration,
3314920	3316840	so much shit happened that I was like,
3316840	3318280	okay, I'm not, you know,
3318280	3321800	a 10-day waiting period is exactly the amount of time you want.
3322520	3325560	I was just like, I don't know why I will want this.
3326200	3328680	I have to assume that I may need it,
3328680	3331320	that I will want it twice as much 10 days from now.
3331320	3332360	Right, right, right.
3332360	3334600	The first 10 days was a doozy.
3335880	3338200	It looked very familiar to anyone
3338200	3340840	who didn't fall asleep during 10th grade history class.
3340840	3341480	Yeah.
3341480	3344200	Like, it looked real fucking familiar.
3344520	3348840	And I just, sometimes, I talked about it with my therapist.
3348840	3349960	She asked me the same thing.
3349960	3350680	What's it for?
3351960	3352680	Is it for you?
3353320	3358440	Is it for, you know, like, look, it's for,
3359320	3362680	sometimes it's for the fact that, like,
3363240	3365400	I think it's just a general state of, like,
3365400	3371480	it's for the fact that all of my control over my recourse
3371480	3376040	to representation, my recourse to sanity and stuff like that,
3376040	3380360	being taken away, it's like, I'm this white privileged dude
3380360	3382760	that's just like, it's my first experience with it.
3382760	3385400	Those nerve endings have never been stimulated.
3385400	3389800	So I just fucking wandered out and bought a power tool
3389800	3392120	that's like, you know, it's like, whoa,
3392920	3396120	you might want to put a hole in another person at some point.
3396120	3398520	Like, it's like a black and Decker commercial in your head.
3398520	3400280	It's just like, don't be caught off guard.
3400520	3403800	Like, it's just sort of like, like, sometimes in my head,
3403800	3407400	if the dust is attacking you, you want to have sometimes,
3407400	3410120	sometimes in my head, it's just a general destabilization thing
3410120	3414440	where it's like, like, like, I want to have it in a locked case
3414440	3415560	somewhere in my home.
3416760	3420760	So that if because of all this domino effect
3420760	3422760	of all the shit that's being caused by people
3422760	3424680	who are rank amateurs in the White House,
3424680	3428440	who are just think executive orders are just like fucking office memos.
3429080	3432520	And purposely causing destabilization.
3432520	3437160	And also out and out calling out to cities and states
3437160	3441080	and saying, I don't recognize your sovereignty.
3441080	3443240	Like, all this talk going on.
3443240	3445000	Sometimes the thought in my head is like,
3445000	3448440	this is as close as we're ever going to get in our lifetime
3448440	3453800	to a situation that could cause plummets of infrastructure
3454440	3460680	on a level that would make me responsible for the food and water
3460680	3463640	of like a large group of people in my neighborhood.
3463640	3468520	And so maybe that guy should have a gun because for friendly reasons,
3469240	3472120	because they won't listen to a whistle around my neck.
3472120	3472680	I don't know.
3474520	3478600	Maybe I'll maybe I end up in charge of 19 kids.
3478600	3483000	You know, like, I don't I don't I don't I don't want to wait
3483080	3487240	until the moment I'm like, I think it's the apocalypse.
3487240	3489640	And Dan Harmon never wanted to be a father.
3491960	3493000	Best sitcom ever.
3494520	3498120	And the funny thing about the end of the world is they did.
3498120	3502600	Yeah, you just never there's never enough time to prepare for it.
3502600	3506680	And you just kind of go, yeah, what's the what are some of the tools I'll need?
3506680	3509000	I mean, I'm also getting a water filter.
3509000	3512360	I'm not I'm not exclusively going, how will I kill people?
3512360	3516040	I'm like, how I must obsessed about all these details.
3516040	3521160	And one of them is like, like, so did you did you talk about going in
3521160	3522040	and buying this yet?
3522040	3526280	Because one of my favorite things that you said when you walked in is like,
3526280	3527480	it's they're so excited to see you.
3527480	3528920	It's like a sushi restaurant.
3528920	3533960	It is when you actually start looking around for them in Burbank.
3533960	3537960	It's like, holy shit, I just I don't think this is very much of an exaggeration.
3537960	3539640	Come out of hiding these places.
3540360	3543000	The street that we went on, it had like nine.
3543720	3546360	It was like there were three on a block.
3546360	3546680	Yeah.
3546680	3547640	And they weren't.
3547640	3549240	It's like, are they competing with each other?
3549240	3552360	They had sandwich boards out front, like a boutique restaurant.
3552360	3555320	Like, like, nine millimeter ammo, half off and stuff.
3555320	3555720	Yeah.
3555720	3556600	Hi Spencer.
3556600	3558040	Hey, I'm helping out.
3559320	3559720	Sorry.
3561080	3562280	I like it when you talk.
3562280	3562680	Thanks.
3562680	3563160	Me too.
3563160	3563720	No, they're very.
3564280	3570840	They're very excited about new gun owners at gun stores for obvious reasons.
3570840	3573960	Old gun owners probably, probably die.
3576760	3579400	They're like, hey, it's like buying a motorcycle.
3579400	3580040	Yeah, exactly.
3580040	3581160	I don't see those guys again.
3581160	3581640	Exactly.
3582440	3583240	We're not we're not.
3583240	3584520	What's that cater to our base?
3585720	3587320	We need to swell our ranks.
3588520	3589640	I don't know anything about guns.
3589640	3591320	Hey, get in here.
3591320	3592840	Welcome to people poison.
3594600	3595720	All right.
3595720	3595960	Yeah.
3595960	3597960	But anyways, my 10 day waiting period is up.
3597960	3601640	So, uh, now I'll have a little, I'll have a locked case in my home.
3602680	3604680	Well, put a gun to their heads, William.
3604680	3606280	Tell them to buy some Trent books.
3607080	3608520	Buy some by Trent.
3608520	3609800	I like segways.
3609800	3610040	Yeah.
3610680	3611720	We got Britta back there.
3611720	3612840	We could sing a song.
3612840	3617640	Do you want to do a selection from your, from your comp, from your graphic novel,
3617640	3623560	which is also a musical about it's the, it's a world's first musical graphic novel.
3623560	3627400	I haven't done a lot of research on that, but I'm pretty sure.
3627400	3630200	I mean, I Googled musical graphic novel and mine was the only one that came up.
3631400	3635880	So maybe if I, but there was musical and then graphic novel and then just me.
3635880	3640680	If I, if I step over here behind Spencer, you'll have this space to play your guitar.
3640680	3641160	Oh yeah.
3641160	3645560	And then, and then Britta could come out and sing a selection or without Scott.
3647480	3647880	All right.
3647880	3649400	Let's rotate and bring out Britta.
3649400	3651000	Britta, you could talk to her a little bit.
3653560	3660840	Now Britta, before she starts talking, she was the voice,
3660840	3665400	the singing voice of gem in gem and the Argonauts hologram hologram.
3665960	3666600	Oh, thank you.
3667240	3668440	And what else were you?
3668440	3669640	You were in your Luna.
3670280	3673400	Yeah, talk about yourself.
3674360	3680040	I don't like to talk about myself, but I, I like to show up wherever Dino says to come.
3680680	3683640	She was the voice of Bliberta on moral oral.
3683640	3684200	Yes.
3684200	3688360	And she was also Elizabeth and Frank and whole.
3688360	3688920	Frank and whole.
3688920	3689160	Yeah.
3689160	3689880	Yes, indeed.
3692600	3693480	Dan took the mic.
3695000	3695960	No, you should keep it.
3695960	3697480	I can use Spencer's here.
3698600	3699480	Okay. Yeah.
3699480	3700440	Spencer never talks.
3701720	3702600	I like it when you talk.
3703480	3704360	He picks his shots.
3705880	3707480	So yeah.
3707480	3708200	What were you saying?
3708200	3710680	I just want you to point at me when it's my turn to sing.
3712200	3712920	Oh, all right.
3714440	3720440	So anyway, yeah, if it, do you guys know moral oral at all?
3722040	3725880	Well, if you like third season of moral oral, which is what got me canceled and in trouble,
3726760	3729400	you'll like Trent because it's really depressing.
3730920	3732680	But it's uplifting a little bit too, right?
3733320	3734920	I don't want to give away too much about it.
3736120	3737240	It's about hope.
3737240	3743480	And people are traditionally in the market for, uh, uh, cynicism and, uh, depression.
3743480	3746040	But even now in, uh, in today's political.
3746040	3746840	Yeah. Yeah.
3746840	3748840	I know it's the worst point.
3748840	3749080	I know.
3749080	3753480	It's the worst time to bring a dark black novel out.
3754840	3756520	You know, it's such a dark black time.
3758840	3761880	It should sell really well though.
3761880	3762440	Don't buy it.
3764680	3765800	It's not cheap either.
3768040	3769320	Aren't you, aren't you?
3769320	3770120	I looked at the price.
3770120	3771480	I'm like, really?
3771480	3772680	Literally selling it.
3772680	3778040	Like if someone gives you $25 on this stage, won't you give them a book from that box you have?
3778040	3779160	It's not $25.
3779160	3782120	It's $24.99 and a penny.
3782120	3784440	So you're saying it's something it's something nobody wants.
3784440	3787080	And it's $15 and $16.
3788280	3788760	Wait, what?
3789800	3791800	No, the ship has sailed.
3791800	3795640	Oh, um, no, I will sell it for $20 here.
3795720	3799880	And, and these guys will, uh, will you sign it to Richie?
3800440	3801320	I can't wait to sign it.
3801320	3804200	Yeah. You have, you had nothing to do with it, but maybe you'll direct.
3804200	3805240	I want to make it stop.
3805240	3805880	It's 9 11.
3808040	3811640	I actually made it because I want to make a stop motion movie of it, uh,
3811640	3813560	and really bore everyone silly.
3813560	3814840	So maybe you could direct it.
3815400	3816440	I can't wait to read it.
3816440	3818760	I want Scott in Britain to do the main voices.
3819480	3820920	Well, we, we can't wait to read it.
3821160	3821640	Okay.
3824440	3826440	Why don't you, why don't you get out your guitar?
3826440	3827400	I'm going to get out of my guitar.
3827400	3828120	You guys talk.
3829400	3833800	All right. Well, uh, so here's the thing Thursday.
3835000	3839160	This audience is the only one that's going to know in time, uh,
3839160	3845240	at starburns industries in Burbank on the stages where we shot Anomalisa.
3845880	3850840	Uh, we're going to do a little dry run, a little test of, uh,
3851080	3858600	uh, of, uh, of using those facilities to, uh, to do, to do the harm in town stream
3858600	3859480	from there.
3859480	3861240	So, uh, it's good.
3861240	3862200	And there's other stuff too.
3862200	3864360	There's a super tight show there going on that night.
3864360	3867800	So where, where, where can we leave eat?
3867800	3870920	Where, where can we refer to people so that in my drunkenness,
3870920	3873800	I can just tell them like, go somewhere and check it out.
3873800	3874680	That doesn't exist.
3875400	3880760	But I mean, it's, it's at the castle 1101 West Isabel street, Burbank.
3881160	3882360	APM Thursday.
3883000	3888280	There'll be a big super tight, uh, lots of bands and standup comedians performing.
3888840	3889960	Uh, it'll be a big party.
3889960	3895000	It'll be booze, free booze and, uh, free to get in.
3895000	3897880	But it's not all ages because there will be free booze there.
3897880	3901560	So, um, right 21 and up.
3901560	3906040	So, um, and, and, and, uh, uh, but, uh, how do we, how do, what,
3906040	3909800	if I'm listening at home and I'm in LA and I'm like, oh, I want to go to that.
3909800	3912120	What if, what if I'm the 500th person to show up?
3912120	3913480	Am I going to get turned away at the door?
3914520	3916760	Uh, yeah, that's the answer.
3916760	3917480	Yeah.
3917480	3918760	There's fire code.
3918760	3923480	Um, Kevin day said he'll put up all the information on harmontown.com.
3923480	3926840	So you could just check out the front page.
3926840	3927240	Okay.
3927240	3928920	So go to harmontown.com.
3928920	3933560	If you're hearing this and you're close enough to Burbank to come and participate
3933560	3941240	in a cost-free, uh, minus your gas money, uh, uh, experiment in, uh, live streaming
3941240	3950760	HD, uh, extravel life and enter in the, uh, the code, uh, underage drinking guys.
3950760	3951960	You got to really buy the book now.
3951960	3952840	Cause I broke the box.
3952840	3953720	I brought it in.
3953720	3955640	There's no way to bring them all home.
3956200	3957320	It's a fucking nightmare.
3957320	3958600	Don't buy that old scam.
3959320	3960200	The oldest trick.
3960920	3962920	I have 40 boxes back there.
3962920	3964360	The old broken box trick.
3964360	3965960	Look at it's a handsome book.
3965960	3971000	Britta, do you want to read from the blurbs in the back of people who read it?
3972680	3979720	Well, with the mic in your face, uh, Trent is trenchant, funny, disturbingly and unremittingly
3979720	3984680	strange how it results in something so touching is anyone's guess.
3984680	3986200	Maybe it's the singing.
3986200	3988120	And who, who said that?
3988600	3989400	Charlie Kaufman.
3990600	3992040	Charlie Kaufman.
3992040	3992840	That's nice.
3992840	3994520	I can't lie about that.
3994520	3995320	I get sued.
3995880	3998040	Wait now, Britta, Britta, read the last one.
3998040	3998600	Read the bottom one.
3998600	4001160	Well, no, it's funnier if they dwindle.
4002200	4003800	They get worse as you go down.
4005400	4006200	The last one.
4006920	4008120	No, no, the second one.
4008120	4009480	Second one, second one, second one.
4009480	4009960	Okay.
4009960	4016920	As pessimistic as Trent is, it still ends up hopeful in its own sick way.
4017880	4018840	And who said that?
4018840	4019480	Andy Richter.
4019480	4020040	Andy Richter.
4020040	4020760	Okay.
4020760	4021240	All right.
4021240	4021800	Next one.
4023080	4026680	Now, this guy you could tell didn't really like it this next year.
4027240	4030120	Dino wrote the greatest scenes on Mr. Show.
4030120	4034280	Here is a book that digs deeper into his alternate universe.
4035160	4037000	Comic and unsettling.
4037000	4040600	It's a perfect dose of stamatopolis.
4040600	4041480	Stamatopoli.
4041480	4042600	Oh, stamatopoli.
4042600	4042920	Sorry.
4042920	4043640	Who said that?
4043640	4044360	Bob Odenkirk.
4044360	4045160	Bob Odenkirk.
4045160	4045640	Yeah.
4046440	4047080	That's what I said.
4047080	4047720	I talked to him.
4047720	4048920	He's like, it wasn't for me.
4050920	4052360	But you wanted his name on the book.
4053320	4056600	But, you know, I said you could say anything and I'll print it.
4056600	4058840	So, and then the next one.
4058840	4064200	Halfway through, bold, original, painfully real, we'll finish tomorrow.
4065160	4067240	He never finished it.
4067240	4068280	Who never finished it?
4068280	4068920	Dana Carvey.
4068920	4069400	Dana Carvey.
4073960	4074680	Never finished it.
4075720	4078600	He had a much better review, but Sandler changed it.
4083240	4085880	Guys, read what Dana Carvey didn't.
4085880	4086200	Okay.
4087560	4088040	All right.
4088040	4088520	Next.
4089080	4090280	This is the last one.
4090280	4092360	I'm not sure who this would appeal to.
4093480	4094280	Who said that?
4094280	4095000	David Cross.
4095000	4095480	Yeah.
4102040	4102520	So both.
4102520	4103080	It's a nightmare.
4103080	4103960	My life's a nightmare.
4104920	4106840	Both Bob, Bob and Dave.
4107400	4107880	Yeah.
4107880	4108760	Didn't like it.
4108760	4109240	Yeah.
4111880	4112360	Yeah.
4112360	4112840	Yep.
4113960	4114840	$25.
4116360	4118040	The $24.99.
4118040	4119400	But I'm selling it over 20.
4120440	4120920	All right.
4120920	4122040	It's probably gonna go down.
4124120	4125720	This is the worst telethon ever.
4130920	4132920	He can't even afford a real box to put it in.
4134920	4140600	Hey, you guys ever stay in a five-star hotel, and you get room service, and then the guy comes
4140600	4143560	in the room, and it's like, Jesus Christ.
4144360	4146280	He knows less about your order than you do.
4147480	4151080	He's in your bedroom functionally, and it's like, you're in your bed,
4151080	4152760	and you're in your underwear, and he's going like,
4154120	4156120	I got a quesadilla.
4157560	4158280	Yeah, I know.
4160440	4161880	And then a Diet Coke.
4161880	4163320	Why are you reviewing it?
4164920	4165480	He doesn't...
4165480	4173560	And then he holds up a croissant and goes, I think it's Moon Bread.
4174360	4175480	Get out of here.
4175480	4177240	You're a stranger in my bedroom.
4177240	4178200	Get out.
4178200	4180360	I came here to get away from people.
4180360	4181240	Get out of here.
4182120	4184120	I want the food to come in a tube.
4185560	4188360	What is your crazy person coming in here talking about?
4188360	4191640	I don't know what about sitting down here makes you into a shrub.
4192040	4192360	Yeah.
4193400	4194680	See, Spencer, that's what you got to do.
4194680	4195640	Just interrupt.
4195640	4195960	Oh, wait.
4195960	4197240	Also, Rob Sharp is here, everybody.
4197240	4198120	Rob Sharp.
4198120	4198920	Bring him out here.
4205000	4206520	He doesn't want to come out.
4206520	4207320	Rob Sharp.
4210360	4211640	Don't step on the books.
4214360	4215800	We don't have enough people out here.
4216520	4217320	Rob Sharp.
4222600	4223240	Look at that.
4223240	4225480	I resent being told I was interrupting.
4225480	4227960	I mean, are you going to do your song?
4229080	4231320	Yeah, but Rob...
4231320	4232120	Hello, Dan.
4233800	4234280	Hi, Rob.
4241560	4242600	Can we hear the guitar?
4243400	4243960	I can.
4243960	4244920	I can hear it fine.
4246840	4248280	That's why you brought me out, right?
4248280	4249320	Yeah, yeah.
4249320	4251240	You're the best at listening to guitars.
4251320	4251800	You hear it?
4253720	4254040	Is it...
4254040	4254520	You hear it out there?
4254520	4255160	I hear it.
4255160	4255720	I hear it.
4258680	4258920	Check.
4258920	4259480	One, two.
4259480	4259720	Check.
4259720	4259960	Check.
4259960	4260440	One, two.
4261880	4262600	Yeah, you do that first.
4263160	4263560	Yeah, yeah.
4265320	4265720	Yeah, yeah.
4265720	4266600	We didn't plan this out.
4267800	4269560	Anyway, this is a song that comes in like
4271320	4273000	beginning of the third act.
4273000	4275320	So you won't know what it's about, but it's kind of a pretty song.
4276200	4277960	But something has happened to their family.
4277960	4279400	How many acts are in this?
4280360	4281240	Three acts, you know.
4286120	4286360	Thanks.
4286360	4287000	What, Jeff?
4288520	4290440	I was asked about the sound department.
4290440	4291960	Do you have volume control on your guitar?
4291960	4293320	And if so, can you turn it up a bit?
4294520	4295080	It's all up.
4295080	4295560	Let's hear that.
4296920	4297400	How's that?
4299160	4300040	Is there something wrong with it?
4300040	4300760	It's a new guitar.
4300760	4303800	No, they just wanted it louder for the audio.
4303800	4304360	Right, I know.
4305800	4306920	I'd say turn up a little bit more.
4306920	4307800	Well, no, it can't go up.
4307800	4308440	Yeah.
4308520	4308760	Okay.
4311160	4312200	But it's a pretty song.
4314600	4315880	Should we all come back later?
4319640	4321560	I thought you made fun of him, not me.
4321560	4322200	I like you.
4322920	4325240	Dino's book is now $17, everybody.
4326280	4326920	$17.
4327720	4328440	Thank God.
4328440	4330920	If it gets any cheaper, we're going to have to print 2,000 more.
4334280	4337160	The nice thing is that you can, you've got all the broken box,
4337160	4339400	but you've got all these books you can build a new box out of.
4342200	4345560	And then you can take the returns home in that.
4345560	4346760	I really hate my life.
4349560	4350280	Look, there's something.
4351240	4351560	Yeah.
4352200	4354360	Do you want to tell them, you want to set up the song at all?
4355080	4355720	Do you want to?
4356360	4357080	Do you want me to?
4357640	4358600	Yeah, you think you should.
4358600	4359160	I don't know.
4359160	4362120	I don't want to spoiler alert it for everyone who's not going to buy it.
4363800	4365720	But I don't know if the song will resonate like you want it to
4365720	4366760	if they don't know what's going on.
4367560	4367800	Yeah.
4367800	4369480	Let's really get to the bottom of this.
4371160	4373400	Let's really think this through.
4373400	4373640	Yeah.
4374360	4375000	It's about pregnancy.
4375000	4375960	Oh, you're not going to help.
4375960	4377880	You just want to, you're just going to yell at us.
4379080	4379320	Okay.
4379320	4379480	Yeah.
4379480	4382920	It's not, it's not a spoiler to say it's about pregnancy, right?
4382920	4383880	It's about pregnancy.
4383880	4385720	Something happens to their baby.
4389080	4389640	It lives?
4393800	4394520	On what page?
4395400	4396520	Two things babies do.
4398200	4400920	One of them is they grow up to be people.
4402040	4405000	There's a lot of things that could go wrong with a baby.
4407880	4408920	That reminds me of a story.
4409960	4411080	You know that story about my friend?
4411080	4414520	I was watching a movie, Outlaw Jesse Wales with my friend
4414520	4416840	and my brother was there and he had seen it.
4416840	4421080	And at one point my friend asked my brother, does this character die?
4421080	4423240	And I'm like, don't whisper it to him.
4423240	4424040	I don't want to know.
4424680	4427160	So my brother whispers if he died or not.
4427160	4430200	And then we start watching some more and my friend turns to him and says, when?
4433160	4434280	When does he keep living?
4437480	4438440	That story's so funny.
4438440	4440040	I've already told it when you weren't here.
4443480	4444600	I've actually already told it.
4444600	4445880	Hey, it's still got a big laugh.
4445880	4446840	No, yeah, they don't care.
4449880	4453960	Okay, so it's a pretty song.
4454040	4455240	I'm probably gonna screw it up.
4456200	4457400	Why? What do you want?
4457400	4457880	Why?
4457880	4459400	Why should this as well at the end?
4459400	4460840	You're saying everything I gave you.
4462760	4463240	Okay.
4463240	4464680	I'm so mad at you right now.
4466680	4467400	I start right now.
4468040	4469880	Yes.
4483960	4499880	He's dead.
4513960	4515880	I know how you feel.
4517400	4519080	You were young so young.
4520520	4521960	You couldn't have known better.
4523560	4527800	I want you to know that I'm not mad.
4528680	4531560	You are my son Trent.
4532600	4533880	And I am your father.
4535400	4537080	Though I know you'll never hear it.
4537640	4540120	You can just call me dad.
4540120	4549160	Trent, Trent, did you feel neglected?
4549160	4550760	Yes, sir.
4550760	4551400	Yes, sir.
4551400	4554360	I stepped in my fight from the start.
4555720	4561880	Trent, Trent, you were unexpected.
4561880	4568760	I promise to always do my part.
4568760	4569400	Pretty, right?
4571000	4571480	All right.
4575640	4576200	That was good.
4577560	4579480	We didn't rehearse it or anything, so.
4580440	4582840	I think we should all nod like Muppets after they finish singing.
4586840	4589480	So that song's inside the comic book?
4589480	4591560	Well, here's the thing, Spencer.
4591560	4592040	Thank you.
4593720	4595400	There's a website that you go,
4595400	4599000	you could all hear it for free, if you want, and then buy it.
4599000	4601160	And the book is now only $15.99.
4601160	4602760	Oh, my God, it's a steal.
4603960	4605240	I swear to God, I'll go buy that.
4605240	4606440	$15.99.
4606440	4606920	Careful.
4610280	4611400	$15.99.
4611400	4612360	Let's make it $15.
4612360	4613000	I don't have change.
4614040	4617960	Well, now that's getting close to the ticket price for Richie Keene's movie,
4617960	4619240	Fist Fight, which comes out.
4619240	4619960	Look at you.
4619960	4621240	Look at you.
4623400	4625880	I think you can even get some popcorn for that money.
4625880	4626840	Hi, Richie, sorry.
4627800	4628280	Sorry.
4629800	4631320	It just went really dark, bro.
4632760	4635400	I was like Winona Ryder at the SAG Awards listening to that thing,
4635400	4636280	when she's like, what?
4636280	4636600	What's that?
4636600	4637240	What's the speech?
4638840	4642920	I know it's about a dead baby, but it's also not as funny as you think it is.
4647400	4648520	It's not shock humor.
4649640	4650440	No, right?
4650440	4651400	It's not shock humor.
4651400	4652200	Use the mic.
4652200	4652680	Say no.
4652680	4653160	No.
4653160	4654200	Yeah.
4654200	4655160	It's very funny.
4656040	4657000	And kind of touching.
4657000	4657640	And yes.
4657640	4658120	And moving.
4658120	4659160	And it's about hope.
4659720	4661240	This is going to be the worst.
4661240	4666440	You know how when you're playing football as a kid,
4666440	4670200	and the suckers walk back to the other side of the...
4671320	4671880	Forget it.
4671880	4674520	Give me a log line on the book.
4674520	4678760	This is going to be the worst suckers walk back to my apartment with all these books.
4678760	4679560	Dino, listen.
4679560	4680920	It's a great book.
4680920	4682920	It's a great play, and it will be a great movie.
4682920	4683640	Thanks, Daddy.
4683640	4684440	I need it.
4684440	4686760	And you're giving them away at $12 a buck.
4686760	4687720	God damn it!
4689000	4689640	All right, $12.
4690520	4693080	You'll never get them at $12 anywhere else!
4694120	4694840	What if you...
4694840	4698120	You're going to see them here, like out on a shelf for five bucks next...
4699480	4700840	What if you scoop them up,
4701560	4705880	take them out, start setting up to sell them for the after-the-show rush?
4705880	4706840	That's what I'm going to do.
4707720	4708760	Oh, you want to get rid of me now?
4709720	4711000	I want my chair back.
4711000	4711320	All right.
4712360	4712840	All right.
4712840	4713960	I feel like I was going to say something,
4713960	4714760	but no, that's okay.
4715720	4716120	Goodbye.
4718120	4719400	Dino Stamatopoulos!
4732760	4734360	I was going to play, like, walk-off music,
4734360	4737560	where you have to put a guitar away, fix your book box.
4739640	4741480	Skydancing Britta Phillips, everybody!
4744760	4746760	Uh-huh, nice.
4749080	4750360	Britta just stole one of your books.
4753240	4754120	I'll get that for you, buddy.
4754120	4755080	Jesus Christ.
4755080	4757400	She's doing my intern job again, my intern job.
4757400	4758520	Cleaning up after Dino.
4758520	4759160	That's good, though.
4759160	4761240	When a mic drops, that means something good happens.
4761240	4762440	All right, Shrav, take a seat.
4762440	4763960	Shrav, go park it out there.
4763960	4764600	All right, Shrav.
4764600	4765000	Shrav, Shrav.
4767800	4768520	Front and center.
4772520	4773560	Britta, you want to stay out with us?
4774760	4775400	You want to?
4775400	4779240	My brother-in-law edited your movie, Matt Freund.
4779240	4779800	Oh, my God.
4779800	4780680	I love Matt Freund.
4780680	4780920	Yeah.
4781720	4785320	We were both first-time feature guys,
4785320	4788440	and we were, like, on a stakeout for eight months in a room together.
4788440	4789640	He's fantastic.
4789640	4791880	He's very talented and wonderful.
4791880	4794280	A little inside baseball, but I do love the man.
4794280	4794840	Yes.
4794840	4798120	And he edited Kumail's Melt-On Show.
4798120	4798520	Correct.
4798520	4799720	Oh, correct.
4799720	4802120	Who's also in Fist Fight, February 17th.
4802760	4804360	Kumail's movie is really great.
4804360	4805640	Have you seen The Big Sick?
4805640	4806440	I haven't seen it, no.
4806440	4807560	It's super great.
4807560	4808440	Has anybody seen it?
4810200	4811160	Yeah, how do you see it?
4811960	4812840	You were at Sundance.
4816040	4817160	How did I see it?
4817160	4817800	Yeah.
4817800	4819560	He got me into a screening.
4819560	4821000	OK, well, OK, all right.
4822040	4824040	You guys, I just got a text from Dino.
4824040	4825960	He's now going to pay you $4 for every book.
4828440	4831320	He's giving away them, and you get $4.
4832280	4834200	I swore I would say whatever you did.
4835720	4836760	Wait, you said $7?
4845960	4847400	He hates his book and money.
4849000	4855160	So I'm working with, you know, I'm slowly writing a book for Double Day,
4855160	4859240	and I have a friend who's helping me on it,
4859320	4862840	and they have a kid in a third grade class.
4863800	4864840	And this is the...
4865720	4867800	I just wanted to share this because I thought it was funny.
4868520	4872920	This is the list of essay topics that the kids generated for a third grade English class.
4872920	4875240	These are the list of essay topics.
4875240	4877880	These are third graders coming up with their own essay topics.
4879240	4880200	For the children.
4880200	4881480	So they pick their own.
4881480	4883800	They're told, you know, this is what an essay is, and then, OK.
4883800	4886360	And then these would be the title of the...
4886440	4889480	These are third graders coming up with their own essay topics.
4889480	4889960	Yes.
4889960	4891560	For essays they'd like to write.
4891560	4893080	And they're in the third grade.
4893080	4893560	Yeah.
4895560	4896040	All right.
4898840	4900200	Shrub has become Ed McMahon.
4903720	4905160	You should help the homeless.
4906760	4908600	The government should help the homeless.
4909800	4911160	Those two are going to get married.
4912520	4914280	Wolves should be thought of more.
4916360	4920920	People should have more kids.
4922120	4923480	So kids are like, no.
4923480	4925000	They're like, well, they're biased.
4926200	4927720	They don't know that they're going to be adults.
4929880	4931000	That's a conflict of interest.
4933000	4933880	I should have a sister.
4934920	4937320	They just think if enough people have kids, they'll be able to take over.
4938920	4941640	Kids should not bring devices on the bus.
4941640	4947000	Everyone should get a kitten.
4950040	4951560	You should go snorkeling.
4952440	4953080	You should.
4954040	4955160	It's fucking awesome.
4955160	4956040	I love snorkeling.
4956840	4957720	I love kittens.
4961080	4961800	Oh, shit.
4961800	4962280	Sorry.
4965240	4965880	Sweatshirt.
4971800	4973000	You can stay, Scott, if you like.
4973000	4973960	You want to stay and join us?
4974600	4975720	Yeah, Scott's going to stay.
4979960	4982520	Although Dino's book price went back up to $14.
4984520	4985480	I've got Dino's phone.
4985480	4986760	We can start calling famous people.
4988920	4990280	Can we call Adam Sandler?
4993240	4994440	Yeah, when he calls, it just goes...
4997000	4999880	These are third grade essay topics picked by third graders.
4999880	5001400	Third grade essay topics.
5002360	5005320	We're about a quarter of the way through the list.
5006360	5009320	These are written by third grade children.
5009880	5012280	They have chosen their own essay topic.
5012280	5014920	These are not the essay, these are the titles of the essay.
5014920	5015480	Yes.
5015480	5019640	So you would know which essay you're talking about without reading the whole essay.
5019640	5021640	You could just do the title first.
5021640	5023160	I like everyone gets a kitten.
5024840	5026200	So far, I don't disagree with them.
5026200	5028120	I think Herbert Hoover ran on that same platform.
5028120	5033800	Yes. I don't disagree with anything that these kids are saying, except for more kids.
5034600	5039240	There is too much junk food, comma, and you should eat less junk food.
5041320	5042760	That person's going to write for Breitbart.
5045160	5046680	Was he speaking directly to you, Dan?
5050200	5052600	Everybody should do rhythmic gymnastics.
5054040	5054840	Okay, you lost me.
5054840	5056520	I'm not inclined to disagree with that.
5056520	5057000	You lost me.
5057080	5058440	Beautiful sport.
5058440	5061960	I think that kid was coached by her mom or his mom.
5061960	5064280	I'd rather watch people do that than snorkel.
5064280	5067480	If you watch people snorkel, you see it as a fucking straw floating around.
5067480	5070760	Don't you hate it when you see an ad of people saying why they don't like Trump,
5070760	5075880	and really cogent arguments against Trump, and then they end it with a kid saying
5076440	5080520	a really articulate thing about why Trump shouldn't be the president.
5080520	5081960	Because it undermines everything.
5081960	5084920	Because the kid has just been coached, and you just feel like all the adults have been coached.
5084920	5086680	None of it has any real authenticity.
5086760	5088440	I haven't seen these ads.
5088440	5091160	Where are we advertising Trump not being president?
5091160	5092200	Well, these are ads I made.
5094600	5099560	There's one clip of a little girl in Scotland's interview, and she goes,
5099560	5100760	Trump is a cunt.
5104360	5106200	I like that kid that set the fire.
5106200	5107400	That's Drew Carey's kid.
5107400	5108600	Drew Carey's child!
5111240	5111880	Hey, young man.
5111880	5112840	What's going on with this fire?
5113560	5114280	I set it.
5115320	5116440	I set this fire.
5116680	5118760	Because I fucking wanted to!
5121960	5123560	Wait, what did he say about Trump?
5123560	5124840	He said Trump can go fuck himself.
5124840	5126760	He said the president's a piece of...
5126760	5127240	All right.
5129560	5130680	What are we doing here?
5130680	5135480	These are essay topics written by third grade students.
5135480	5136520	Well played.
5136520	5139800	Rob, refresh us on the premise right now, please.
5139800	5140680	These are titles.
5141560	5143160	These are the titles that they chose.
5143160	5143880	They chose.
5143880	5144920	They didn't write them.
5144920	5145240	No.
5145240	5146520	They haven't written essays yet.
5146760	5147640	They haven't written the essays.
5147640	5149080	They've submitted these essay titles.
5149080	5150440	I imagine there's another round of...
5150440	5151720	These are the children.
5151720	5152120	Yeah.
5152120	5152520	Okay.
5152520	5155160	The third graders themselves, they picked their own essay topics.
5155160	5157000	You know, in my day, you'd be told,
5157000	5158920	you need to write an essay about Harriet Tubman.
5158920	5161400	Oh, well, you know, now we're more interactive.
5161400	5162600	These kids are going to break off.
5162600	5163880	Guy knocked that camera.
5164520	5165240	Yeah, he did.
5166680	5168760	It's Spencer's profile.
5168760	5171640	Yeah, I don't want to be on film anymore, anyway.
5171640	5172120	All right.
5172120	5172600	All right.
5172600	5175320	Can we do it digitally then?
5175320	5175640	Okay.
5175640	5177800	I bet the audience will figure out how to get it back.
5178600	5179080	I don't know.
5179960	5180920	Kevin, you want that fixed?
5182360	5183640	I had a feeling he would be here.
5183640	5185000	I mean, Chris, I'm in.
5185000	5185640	Technician.
5185640	5186520	Trick-nition.
5186520	5187160	Chris Brough.
5187160	5187720	Chris Brough.
5187720	5190600	Okay, back to work.
5190600	5191720	All right.
5191720	5193240	We got some Chris Brough.
5194520	5195480	These are titles.
5195480	5195720	All right.
5195720	5198920	These are titles that third grade English students came up with for the essays.
5198920	5201720	The English students came up with.
5206280	5209320	Uh, you should go to Universal Studios.
5210760	5211400	You shouldn't.
5211400	5212920	You shouldn't.
5212920	5213880	You don't want to.
5213880	5215400	You know, get a little Butterbeer, maybe.
5215400	5216360	Yeah.
5216360	5219720	But what better needed essay than if we all disagree?
5219720	5222120	You know, like, let's have this kid, like, let's give them their time.
5222120	5224440	I want to read the passionate essay about that.
5226440	5227880	We need more sushi.
5230360	5231240	That's a good point.
5232040	5235160	Yeah, I love that a third grader is an expert in sushi, though.
5235160	5236680	Especially living in Los Angeles.
5236680	5239880	One thing that we're really lacking is enough sushi restaurants.
5241400	5242840	These are also in the corporate interest.
5242840	5245160	They're also, like, they all work for these conglomerates.
5246760	5248040	They all work for Big Kitten.
5250360	5252360	I should be on a basketball team.
5254680	5255560	Oh, my God.
5255560	5257560	Well, then put that pencil down, my friend.
5259320	5263640	You're on a one-way train to no sports town.
5265160	5266600	I should get a new bike.
5268200	5270920	This guy, yeah, he just mistook it for a Santa list.
5271880	5273240	I should get an iPhone.
5274200	5277160	I should get more room for my toys.
5277160	5279000	There's a little twist there.
5279000	5280120	Brentwood kid.
5280120	5281640	That is a spoiled kid.
5281640	5283000	They don't even want more toys.
5283000	5284680	They want more toy storage.
5288680	5292920	I need to annex my sister's room to store my toys.
5293880	5296280	Uh, I should get a dog.
5297560	5299080	It's wearing a rut here of kids.
5299080	5300600	I think they're all looking at each other going,
5300600	5301880	what is an essay topic?
5301880	5303400	And they're like, it's shit you get.
5303400	5304200	Hey, Dan.
5304840	5307400	Dan, read those last few like you were a really depressed guy.
5310200	5311960	I should be on a basketball team.
5313560	5315400	Like you haven't achieved anything and you know it.
5316680	5317800	I should get a new bike.
5321400	5322600	I should get an iPhone.
5323720	5325240	I should get more room for my toys.
5327640	5328360	I should get a dog.
5331960	5333400	You're just staring out the window.
5335800	5337720	Okay, this one I don't understand.
5338360	5339720	I'll clear it up.
5339720	5343800	More people should be on DJ Loug.
5345960	5347160	I've been saying this for years.
5347160	5353320	Sounds like something sounds like a radio station that's somebody.
5353320	5355640	It could be the word league without the E on the end.
5355640	5357880	No more people should be on DJ league.
5357880	5360280	If the school has a DJ league, I'm going to kill myself.
5361320	5363000	I was on their side a minute ago.
5365080	5367560	Criminals should be caught on videotape.
5373720	5375400	Very few people on the other side of that issue.
5375400	5377000	The problem is all the innocent people.
5377400	5379560	Caught on videotape, my child.
5380680	5383720	But if you're saying eye witness accounts are unreliable
5383720	5384920	and police should have body cams.
5385880	5387640	Maybe that's what they overheard their parents saying.
5389400	5390200	Oh, okay.
5390200	5391640	This is third grade children.
5391640	5391800	Yeah.
5392920	5394040	How old are you in third grade?
5394040	5395320	You're nine, nine years old.
5395320	5399640	Where, where, where, where are these kids now?
5401800	5403080	They're, they're, they're...
5403080	5403720	Bring them on.
5404680	5405720	Bring them up.
5405720	5406520	They're sleeping.
5407480	5409160	They're surrounded by kittens and dogs
5409160	5411480	and snorkeling all over the goddamn place.
5411480	5412200	Oh, oh shit.
5412200	5412680	I'm sorry.
5414440	5416440	It looked like these were two different things.
5416440	5419560	No, the full thing is criminals should be caught on videotape
5419560	5421640	because eye witness cannot be trusted.
5425960	5428120	And that little boy grew up to be big brother.
5428120	5428620	Right.
5430120	5431240	Or, I mean, I am.
5432040	5433800	How is that when he was a little brother?
5433800	5434920	How is eye spelled?
5435640	5437080	Eye witness.
5437080	5437320	Yeah.
5437320	5438120	How is it?
5438120	5439560	Is it eye or is it...
5439560	5440600	No, it's spelled like the...
5440600	5441160	Oh, okay.
5441160	5441960	Spelled like the...
5441960	5443320	Because eye witness.
5444520	5445080	No, no, no, no.
5445080	5446440	You just didn't know how to spell that, Rob?
5446440	5447000	Eye witness.
5447000	5447480	What's that?
5447480	5448440	You just didn't know how to spell?
5449080	5449320	No.
5449960	5451400	Why do you think I came here tonight?
5453080	5454200	Eye should get a pet.
5455000	5455800	Spelled how?
5455800	5456040	Hack.
5458040	5460360	Kid, kids are already burning up that dog topic.
5461640	5462920	You should stop littering.
5463800	5464440	Old judgey.
5468920	5470200	Dance is the best.
5471160	5472280	Dance is the best.
5473080	5474280	Sometimes you gotta dance it out.
5474280	5476200	Dance should be caught on videotape.
5477320	5480040	Basketball is the world's best sport
5480040	5482040	and hockey is the best sport.
5482040	5484360	I assume that last kid will beat up the kid above him and...
5485320	5485880	All right, yeah.
5485880	5489320	Those were third grade essay topics from a real...
5489320	5490520	That's kind of a desk piece.
5491160	5493800	I want to get those essays, though.
5493800	5495560	I want to see what they became.
5495560	5498200	How did you get a hold of those?
5498200	5500440	I am friends with a person who I'm working with
5500440	5503080	that their kid is in this third grade class
5503080	5504360	and they're teachers.
5504360	5505560	I'm wearing a lot of fun stories.
5506360	5507480	Teachers, whenever we have them...
5507480	5510040	Name one fun story.
5510040	5510760	Whatever, whatever.
5510760	5511880	Just name it.
5511880	5512920	Just name it.
5512920	5513880	What is the title?
5515080	5518040	What are the titles for this fun story?
5518040	5519960	If you're a teacher and you're a fan of the show.
5519960	5521080	Is this the title?
5521080	5522440	I'd love you to come on the show.
5522440	5523640	I'm always begging these people.
5523640	5526280	I beg this person, this teacher,
5526280	5528040	because she's written some stuff...
5529400	5531320	She sends out an email to the parents
5531320	5534280	and the stuff that she says about teaching...
5534280	5536200	Name one thing she says.
5537880	5539400	If you're not going to name a story.
5539400	5539960	I don't have it.
5539960	5540600	You don't have it.
5540600	5542600	Take my word for it that she's an admirable person.
5542600	5543960	Are there any teachers in the audience?
5545240	5546600	We can't see you, so say something.
5546600	5547480	Well, we don't want to...
5547480	5548520	There'll be some guy going,
5548520	5549160	I lied.
5549160	5552520	Buy my fucking sponge that I make for washing your car.
5552520	5553400	It might be Dino.
5554920	5556200	But it'll be a sponge that keeps you
5556200	5557400	from slitting your wrists.
5557400	5558520	I can't kick him off stage.
5559480	5561480	Remember when Dino came out with a box full of books
5561480	5562760	and pretended the box broke
5562760	5565320	so all the books spilled out across the floor
5565320	5567960	and tried to elicit our pity so we would buy his book?
5569800	5572600	In entertainment news, did you guys know that this guy...
5572600	5573800	It's now $17.
5573800	5574760	Taika Waititi.
5574760	5580280	He signed on to direct this crazy stop-motion movie
5580280	5582040	about Michael Jackson's chimp.
5582600	5583560	I read that movie.
5583560	5585480	Talk about career suicide, am I right?
5586920	5588520	But we wish him the best of luck
5589080	5592440	with his new feature project, Bubbles,
5592440	5593800	produced by Starburns Industry.
5593800	5594920	It's my studio!
5594920	5596120	That's why I brought it up.
5596120	5596520	I know.
5598280	5599000	All right, anyways.
5599000	5599960	Lashed out at me with those.
5599960	5601160	You're making that movie?
5601160	5601640	Claws.
5601640	5602520	I read that script.
5602520	5603240	It's amazing.
5603240	5604040	Yeah, man.
5604040	5604840	Oh, it's so good.
5604840	5606200	It really is.
5606200	5606440	Yeah.
5607640	5609640	Now that hopefully it's been more set up,
5609640	5612280	we'll have the writer on in coming months maybe,
5612280	5614920	and we'll have the director on.
5614920	5616200	We'll have the monkey on maybe.
5617720	5619080	They'll rip off your face.
5620840	5623080	Those things will rip your face off.
5623080	5623560	Yeah.
5623560	5624520	And testicles.
5626440	5626920	So don't...
5628440	5629640	Don't mess with them.
5629640	5630920	Just make it shorter.
5630920	5633480	What animals do you encounter in the wild
5633480	5635000	in its own natural environment?
5635000	5636760	Would you be most terrified to encounter?
5637400	5638040	Which one?
5638040	5638360	Well, yeah.
5638360	5640840	Which particular species of animal?
5640840	5641240	Man.
5650040	5651800	I was seriously a chimpanzee, right?
5651800	5656120	Because it's like a human will shoot you or blow you up.
5656120	5658840	A lion will just fucking eat you and eviscerate you.
5658840	5661000	But what we know of chimps is that they will...
5661000	5662600	They'll dress up like cowboys,
5662600	5663960	and then they'll rip your face off.
5664920	5666920	Yeah, they'll write a tricycle on the Tonight Show,
5666920	5667880	and then you'll be like,
5667880	5669080	hey, can I have the tricycle back?
5669080	5670120	And I'll be like, I'm not sure.
5670120	5671560	I went through puberty an hour ago.
5671560	5673160	So nope, nope.
5673960	5674200	Pop.
5674760	5675960	Just peel.
5675960	5676920	Now it's my face.
5679080	5680600	Now I'm gonna rip your jaw off.
5680600	5682040	I'm gonna rip your jaw around like a ceiling fan
5682040	5685640	because my little tiny monkey arms are stronger than...
5685640	5686040	Yes.
5686040	5687240	...a fucking tank.
5687240	5688200	Spencer, who do you think...
5688200	5689240	Bite off your fingers.
5689240	5692520	Spencer, what animal would you say is the most formidable
5692520	5693880	if you had to encounter them,
5693880	5695560	which would be more terrifying for you?
5695560	5696200	Yeah, man.
5697000	5697480	Man.
5697480	5698280	They got guns.
5699000	5702040	You'd rather go one-on-one with a man than like a leopard?
5702040	5702760	Yeah, yeah.
5704120	5704920	Really?
5704920	5705160	Yeah.
5706040	5710520	I would rather go one-on-one with a man than a leopard.
5710520	5711720	Like hanging out?
5712360	5714120	Like just going out, like going out on a...
5714120	5715080	Buying shoes and...
5716360	5717480	Any encounter.
5717480	5718600	Window shopping.
5718600	5720760	Probably better with a man than a leopard.
5720760	5722920	No, you said man was the most dangerous.
5722920	5723560	Yeah, yeah.
5723560	5724280	I would say, but you...
5724280	5726680	I don't think the question has been posed very closely.
5726680	5727720	No, he means cheetah.
5728760	5731640	He means multiple questions flying around.
5731640	5732600	Yeah, no.
5732600	5734680	No one has been clear in what the question is.
5734680	5737240	The question wasn't, what are you more scared of?
5737240	5739720	The question was, like, wait, what are you asking?
5739720	5743640	What would be the last animal you'd want to go one-on-one with?
5743640	5745720	Like the one that you would be most afraid to...
5745720	5746280	Oh, a hippo.
5746280	5746440	...to face.
5747960	5749880	Yeah, you can't stop a hippo.
5749880	5752280	Hippo's more than sharks.
5752280	5753800	Yeah, I feel like if I...
5753800	5754280	I don't know.
5754280	5756760	I mean, if a lion's like, I'm gonna kill this guy,
5756760	5757720	he's probably gonna kill you.
5757720	5760440	But like, if a lion's like, I might kill this guy
5760440	5762120	and you stab him in the eye or something,
5762120	5763800	he might fuck off, you never know.
5763800	5766120	But like a hippo, oh man, you're dead.
5766120	5767240	You're fucking dead.
5768680	5770200	I hear terrible things about geese.
5775320	5776920	Well, what are your sources?
5778040	5781480	Anyone who's ever been golfing tells me that a goose
5781480	5782680	almost took their face off.
5783640	5786440	They don't got strong jaws, let me tell you that.
5786440	5788600	They will bite you till the cows come home,
5788600	5789960	but it won't hurt that bad.
5790760	5793000	Spencer, you've been bitten by a geese?
5793000	5793160	Yeah.
5793160	5794120	And you have cows?
5794120	5794680	By a geese.
5795560	5798920	Yeah, they saved the day.
5800680	5802040	I was fucked.
5802040	5803640	Have you been bitten by a goose?
5803640	5804120	Yeah, yeah.
5804120	5806520	I mean, I used to go to duck pongs and stuff
5806520	5807640	and feed animals.
5807640	5809640	And yeah, geese are the super aggressive.
5809640	5811400	They got weird, weird, yeah.
5811400	5812120	They bit you?
5812120	5812680	Yeah.
5812680	5816520	Well, tell us a classic goose bite story.
5816520	5818440	What part of your body did they bite you?
5819800	5821160	Describe it slowly.
5821160	5822040	The hands.
5826520	5828120	They bit me on the hands.
5829560	5830040	I know.
5830680	5832360	Because you had duck food in your hands?
5833160	5833660	Yeah.
5835560	5838760	One time me and my friends were hanging out behind a Costco
5838760	5843080	and we found that they threw out more than 40 fresh loaves of bread
5843080	5844520	because they got the new bread in,
5844520	5846920	but they weren't bad breads, presumably.
5847560	5850760	So we got 40 loaves of bread and went to the duck pond.
5852520	5853160	It was good.
5853720	5855880	I think you guys were probably stoned.
5857400	5859080	No, we were definitely stoned, but that's not...
5860200	5861480	We were making it rain.
5861560	5867560	We were like, slices and slices just flooding the water.
5868200	5870440	It was probably bad for the local environment.
5871800	5873800	But no, you know, they were all loving it.
5873800	5876760	I used to feed ducks and animals a lot, like a duck pond.
5876760	5878440	In Simi Valley, there wasn't a lot to do.
5878440	5881720	There was a big duck pond that you could go to, all sorts of animals.
5881720	5883000	And so sometimes you'd feed them.
5883000	5884840	But yeah, the geese are the most aggressive.
5884840	5886920	So they'd come and they'd kind of swarm you
5886920	5888440	and they'd really get like...
5889160	5892360	They put their necks up like they're trying to square up with you.
5892360	5893880	To get food from you?
5893880	5896760	Yeah, they know you have food and they're trying to bully you.
5896760	5897560	That's crazy.
5897560	5898360	That seems like so...
5898360	5899720	I think they're territorial too, though.
5899720	5901480	Yeah, and they're stupid.
5901480	5903720	They're just really angry and dumb.
5903720	5905960	Like, they don't get really loathsome animal trait.
5907560	5909880	You know, I understand animals coming at you
5909880	5912360	and maybe scaring you because they want the food,
5913000	5917160	but an animal that's being mean to you because it wants your food.
5917160	5917800	What a dick.
5917800	5919960	Yeah, they're not nice.
5919960	5921640	Geese are lame, man.
5923080	5923560	Yeah.
5923560	5925560	Wow, way to bring it down, bro.
5925560	5926200	This whole thing just can't be stopped.
5926200	5928680	I wonder if swans are like that.
5928680	5932600	I mean, isn't a swan just like a fancy goose?
5932600	5933320	I think.
5933320	5934200	Yeah, I don't know.
5934200	5934600	Yeah, man.
5934600	5936280	What about those swans, man?
5936280	5937320	Yeah, what about the swans?
5937320	5938760	Check out the swan.
5938760	5941240	Have a swan ever tried to get your bread, man?
5942200	5942760	No, no.
5942760	5944600	No, what about these swans?
5944600	5946600	I feel like they don't get close to the swans.
5946600	5947560	Or haven't seen them.
5948200	5948680	I don't know.
5948680	5949080	No.
5949080	5953640	What do you guys think about, like, you know how in hotels, like...
5956280	5957080	Room service.
5958360	5959320	Fucking room service.
5959320	5965000	Like, no matter how much or how little snacks are available,
5965000	5969160	the Snickers bar is like the Gideon Bible of the hotel snacks.
5969160	5969800	Always there.
5969800	5973080	So I wonder, is that like a corporate toll hole?
5973080	5974520	Completely unrelated.
5974760	5977640	That's got to be based on demand, though, right?
5977640	5978360	That's got to be...
5978360	5980200	No, that's got to be demand.
5980200	5982040	That's like the generic candy bar.
5982040	5985320	I bet if you pulled candy bar Snickers is number one.
5985320	5985800	Yeah.
5985800	5986680	It's the one that you can count on.
5986680	5988760	So how come there's not like a bunch of, like,
5988760	5991880	Snockers and Snookers and, like, like, like these rip-offs?
5991880	5992440	Like, how much...
5993240	5994200	Wait, wait, wait.
5994200	5995000	Like, how come there's not...
5995000	5996840	Like, there's not really a lot of candy bars
5996840	5998440	that are very close to Snickers.
5998440	6003080	I wonder if there's like a weird patent-squatting, like, yeah.
6003160	6003720	Like, they just...
6003720	6006600	Like, if you try to add a certain amount of nougat to something,
6006600	6009480	they go like, ahem, we invented that.
6009480	6011080	And you're like, I can't have nougat?
6011080	6012600	And they're like, you can't have nougat.
6013960	6015720	I think they invented nougat.
6015720	6016360	So, yeah.
6016360	6018920	I think nougat's kind of a gray area, too.
6018920	6021640	What actually comprises of nougat...
6021640	6023000	What was the chewing and delicious?
6023000	6023800	And that's all we know.
6023800	6025080	You don't know what nougat is?
6025080	6026440	Talking about nougat.
6026440	6028040	You eat it and then you get a new gut.
6029560	6030280	No, that's great.
6030280	6031320	That's a great joke.
6033320	6033800	Yeah.
6035800	6037080	If you're talking to a child.
6037080	6039800	Dina's books are back down to $13 because of that.
6039800	6040600	God damn it!
6043240	6045240	I had to find the snack bar after the show.
6045240	6046600	All right, but they're back to $15.
6047880	6048360	All right.
6048360	6049080	Here we go.
6049080	6051400	I talked about pee and...
6051400	6051880	And cum.
6052760	6053720	Talked about cum.
6053720	6056040	But Snickers are really satisfying.
6056040	6056840	They're the fucking best.
6057640	6058760	Oh, man, they're a meal.
6058760	6059960	I ate one on the way here.
6059960	6060760	I'm gonna have a late dinner tonight.
6060840	6064040	Hey, Dan, do you remember when you and I had a deep fried Mars bar in Scotland?
6064840	6065800	That was fucking good.
6067480	6071080	The myth of the deep fried common day items,
6071080	6073800	I'm gonna put a little dent in that if I could.
6073800	6074680	They don't exist.
6076920	6078440	Oh, I'm gonna have a deep fried...
6078440	6079160	It's a myth!
6079160	6080440	I'm gonna have a deep fried whatever.
6082760	6084040	A deep fried peanut butter cup.
6084680	6089480	It's a ball of fried bread or whatever the fuck they say.
6089480	6091480	And you open it and it's just goop.
6091480	6092600	Like, come on.
6092600	6094520	Let's get real about what we're doing.
6094520	6097400	I seem to recall you enjoying your deep fried Mars bar
6097400	6098600	when we were really drunk in Scotland.
6098600	6099080	Well, sure.
6099960	6100840	Yeah, it's delicious.
6100840	6101560	Okay.
6101560	6102840	I'm not gonna eat that.
6102840	6104360	So I won't eat that.
6104360	6105320	Forensic files.
6105320	6106760	It's goop in the middle.
6108280	6109560	I'm not eating this.
6110760	6111560	Excuse me, miss.
6111560	6112920	Will you please take this bath?
6113880	6114440	No, I'm not gonna...
6114440	6115160	I'm not gonna eat this.
6115160	6116520	Yeah, I'm not gonna throw it in the garbage.
6116520	6118600	It's a bunch of hot chocolatey mess.
6119560	6121480	It is not to my satisfaction.
6123640	6125960	It's melted on the inside.
6125960	6128200	Well, we put it in boiling oil, sir.
6129560	6130840	Why did you do that?
6133800	6135160	Why did you do that?
6139960	6142360	$5 gets you the video subscription.
6142360	6148840	So, you know, at the...
6148840	6150280	If you watch forensic files, you know,
6150280	6151960	they always have to close the episode
6151960	6152840	because it's always sad.
6152840	6154040	Someone got murdered, you know,
6154040	6156440	and so they can't end it with just the people
6156440	6157800	because they can't go like,
6157800	6159720	yay, we solved the forensics.
6159720	6161800	Like, oh, like, like, hooray.
6161800	6163160	I was stuck in the closet.
6165000	6167160	I was stuck in the closet.
6167160	6168360	We thought you were murdered.
6168360	6170200	No, I was stuck in the closet.
6171160	6173720	I'm so hot in there and I've eaten a coat.
6173720	6174440	I'm so...
6175080	6176600	I'm stuck in the closet.
6176600	6178200	That would have been a good episode.
6178200	6179000	They don't do that.
6179000	6180120	But they never do that because they...
6180120	6180920	They should do that.
6181720	6182920	They should do it once.
6184920	6186440	The second to last thing that happens
6186440	6187240	is always the...
6188200	6189480	Stuck in the closet.
6190200	6191720	The murdered people's families,
6191720	6192520	they have to say like,
6192520	6194200	oh, we're so sad they got murdered
6194200	6195880	and we always hang out in their grave
6195880	6197320	and we always, like, miss them and stuff
6197320	6198760	and it sucks that they're dead.
6199160	6200440	But you can't end the episode like that.
6200440	6202280	So then they always need this, like...
6202280	6203560	And I don't know how come they haven't
6203560	6204760	just figured it out.
6204760	6206360	I don't get people to say it.
6206360	6207960	But I guess because it's hard
6207960	6209160	for these cops and stuff
6209160	6210840	because it always has to be like a cop
6210840	6212040	that says it and they're not...
6212040	6213560	You know, look, if you're a cop
6213560	6215080	and you're listening and you're a genius,
6215080	6216840	like, email me.
6216840	6221640	But, like, I'm just saying
6221640	6223480	there's been court cases
6223480	6224840	about the fact that they screen you
6224840	6225720	for a high IQ
6225720	6227960	and not in the positive side.
6228040	6229480	Like, they're like...
6229480	6230360	Because you tend to quit
6230360	6231400	and waste taxpayers' money.
6231400	6233400	But so these cops are kind of like...
6233400	6234280	You know, and they live...
6234280	6236040	And then so then they're like...
6236040	6237320	You want to close the episode
6237320	6238360	with them saying...
6238360	6239480	They just need to say
6239480	6242120	that forensics were important.
6242120	6243640	And so they're always like...
6243640	6244200	They just like...
6244200	6245800	The music is rising up.
6245800	6247240	And it's like sometimes it takes them
6247240	6248040	a really long time.
6248040	6248600	Like, they're like...
6249880	6251560	This was a case
6251560	6254360	that where a person definitely
6254360	6255640	did a bad thing
6255640	6257560	and it's not done as much.
6257960	6259240	But if it weren't...
6259240	6262360	If it weren't for science...
6264360	6265000	You can just...
6265000	6266200	You just like sense the...
6266760	6267800	This is kind of funny.
6267800	6269320	It's just something I wanted to talk about.
6271240	6272920	I just watch every episode of Forensic Files
6272920	6273640	and I'm always like waiting
6273640	6274360	for that part at the end
6274360	6275720	where somebody's just like...
6275720	6277560	Like, they're almost getting played off.
6277560	6279000	You hear like the theme music coming up
6279000	6279880	and they're just like...
6279880	6282840	Like, this is a guy who's a bad guy.
6282840	6283480	Say science.
6283480	6284600	Say science.
6284600	6285640	Yeah, exactly.
6285640	6286360	They're like waiting.
6286360	6286840	They're just like...
6286840	6288440	They just want them to say like...
6288440	6290040	No, and you can tell that
6290040	6291960	the way they start their quotes.
6291960	6293320	You can tell the interviewers are asking.
6293320	6293960	They're like...
6293960	6296280	So, do you think forensic science
6296280	6299240	was crucial to this investigation?
6299240	6300120	And they go, yes.
6300120	6301480	They go, what could you repeat?
6302520	6305000	Can you make the question part of the answer?
6305000	6306040	And so they go like...
6306040	6308360	I definitely think forensic science
6308360	6309480	was important.
6309480	6311560	Because when you have a crime...
6313960	6314680	And then the police...
6315320	6316600	We do things.
6317560	6323480	But obviously, that swab from her vagina,
6325080	6326920	that really tied it up.
6326920	6327880	Boom, boom, boom, boom.
6327880	6329080	Later on, Jimmy Kimmel.
6333720	6334920	The forensic files guy,
6334920	6336280	the voiceover guy.
6336280	6338120	I don't like that guy
6338120	6339320	because he's always out of breath.
6339320	6339800	He's like...
6339800	6342440	And then a guy came in.
6342440	6343800	No, come on, he's the best.
6343800	6346440	And then the door was open.
6347000	6349560	That guy is the show.
6349560	6350680	How do you not like that guy?
6350680	6351800	But you like forensic files.
6351800	6352440	I don't like that guy.
6352440	6353800	I like trying to bring some energy
6353800	6354760	to the situation.
6354760	6355560	They're dead people.
6355560	6357320	It's a story about a person
6357320	6358680	that got slashed to pieces.
6358680	6359560	There's energy already.
6359560	6361640	What I like about that guy
6361640	6363240	is that he picks it up at the end
6363240	6364280	when they get to the point
6364280	6365000	where they're finally
6365000	6365960	conclusively approved
6365960	6366840	what the murder is.
6366840	6368040	And then the guy
6368040	6369400	has to describe the murder.
6369400	6370440	So out of empathy,
6370440	6371560	he starts amping it up.
6371560	6372680	Or he's the guy who did it
6372680	6373560	and he's really panicked.
6374120	6376200	And his heart is beating
6376200	6377880	a million miles in a second.
6377880	6379160	That'd be the greatest serial killer
6379160	6380840	of all time who hosts his own show.
6382600	6383400	Like this arsonist
6383400	6384360	always goes back to the scene
6384360	6385480	like watches the fire burn
6385480	6386840	with the fire department.
6386840	6388840	So science has proven
6388840	6390280	that that guy did it.
6390280	6392760	And he said join us next week.
6392760	6393240	We're going to get
6393240	6394360	that little girl's killer.
6395320	6396200	Oh, she's not dead yet.
6396200	6396840	But we'll get her.
6399000	6400200	They also during the recap
6400200	6402040	they incorporate all of the things
6402120	6403800	like that they found forensically.
6403800	6404760	So they make it sound
6404760	6406040	like the person doing the crime
6406040	6407240	did all these really weird
6407240	6408680	specific microscopic things.
6408680	6411400	Like pulling into the driveway
6411400	6412680	angry about his girlfriend.
6412680	6414120	He got out of the car.
6414120	6415000	And as he did,
6415000	6416200	his fingertips touched
6416200	6417400	the edge of the door
6417400	6418760	leaving the grease stains
6418760	6420120	later found by police.
6420680	6422120	He yanked her hair
6422120	6423880	pulled her down the driveway
6423880	6425640	leaving a slight trail
6425640	6427400	of grease and dandruff
6428280	6429720	that the dog would lick up
6429720	6431880	and that the dog pathologist
6431880	6433480	would find in the dogs intestines.
6434280	6435400	Anyway, I'm not making
6435400	6436040	my point clear.
6436040	6436600	I don't know what my
6437800	6439000	science event so far
6439000	6440360	that we can find dead people's
6440360	6441800	dandruff in a dog's intestines.
6443000	6444440	They had a really sad dog one.
6444440	6445560	I would have really bummed you out.
6445560	6446680	Dog got the dog.
6446680	6447640	Because I'm the only one that
6448200	6449080	likes dogs.
6449080	6449400	Yeah.
6449400	6450840	No, it's the dog.
6450840	6451960	You're the only one that like
6451960	6453320	during our fascist takeover
6453320	6454440	you're like still tweeting.
6454440	6455400	Like you said this last week.
6455400	6455800	Don't forget to take
6455800	6457320	it to adopt a dog last week.
6458200	6458920	Last week you said
6458920	6460840	there was a dog that got shot.
6460920	6463000	But then the dog got shot.
6463560	6465640	And then he still at the end
6465640	6467240	he got he tried to still
6467240	6468520	he got shot and then he was like
6468520	6469720	out of commission for a little bit.
6469720	6473080	And then the way that the guy got caught
6473080	6474440	he was a Samoan gangster
6474440	6475400	named Sabo Claus.
6477880	6479080	Those gangs must be scary.
6479080	6479800	We've talked about that
6479800	6481000	like cactus bunch and stuff.
6481000	6483720	Like if you're like these gangs
6483720	6485080	when those gangs that have
6485080	6486840	like silly names like you're oh man
6486840	6488280	they must fucking just like
6488280	6489640	I guess he was like in a Hannibal
6489960	6491000	Dolly in the court and it was
6491000	6492440	just like I want to do it more.
6494360	6497160	But Sabo Claus got busted only
6497160	6499240	because the dog that he shot
6499240	6500280	his name was Chief.
6501720	6503800	He got shot in the fucking just
6503800	6504760	like I guess he was like
6504760	6506120	in a Hannibal Lector Dolly
6506120	6507160	in the court and it was just like
6507160	6508280	I want to do it more.
6509560	6510680	Fuck Sabo Claus.
6512040	6512280	Yep.
6513880	6515240	But not you know not because
6515240	6516760	he's Samoan because he's a gangster.
6517640	6518760	So I'll make that clear.
6519960	6520520	Samoans.
6520520	6521720	Samoans have provided us
6521720	6524520	with a lot of like wonderful people.
6525880	6526440	Yes.
6526440	6527480	Dwayne The Rock Johnson
6527480	6528440	I think is one of them maybe.
6528440	6529960	What are some of the inventions
6529960	6533560	that Samoans made in history?
6534120	6535800	Like famous inventions.
6535800	6536680	They have a good cookie.
6536680	6537720	That's the cookie.
6539400	6539960	The cookies.
6539960	6540760	I get it every year.
6541640	6542280	Yeah.
6542280	6543240	A lot of people don't know
6543240	6545160	that Ben Franklin's key was Samoan.
6546120	6556520	I mean who asked that?
6556520	6557640	That sounds like that's something
6557640	6559320	you ask on a racist website.
6559320	6561240	Who would Samoans provide for us?
6562120	6563560	I found I'm cracking the case.
6563560	6565080	What did Harriet Tubman invent?
6571080	6572280	Maybe she didn't get a chance.
6573720	6575000	You know maybe Thomas Edison
6575000	6576280	when he was born he was given
6576280	6579400	like a bunch of light bulb assembly kits.
6579400	6579960	We don't know.
6587000	6588520	Hey guys we only have a couple minutes left.

6701560	6703560	All she could see was the back of my dick
6703560	6706280	because she was using the back of her eyeballs to look at shit.
6707160	6708280	That's how eyeballs work.
6708280	6709480	They work on both sides.
6709480	6712200	They're orbs and when you open them twice as wide
6712200	6714920	you can see 360,000 degrees
6714920	6717800	and you see all the humanities on its knees
6717880	6720920	because we've been abusing the planet, abusing our air.
