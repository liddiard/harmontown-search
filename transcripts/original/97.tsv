17380	19480	Bonjour and bonsoir, Madam and Mademoiselle.
19480	23280	Welcome once again to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.
23280	25780	Harman Town is now in session.
25780	35780	CHEERING
35780	40780	While we're at it, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
40780	51780	CHEERING
51780	53780	Thank you.
53780	56780	Nothing really to talk about tonight.
56780	57780	Woo!
57780	59780	Very busy, very sleepy.
59780	62780	Before I get on this GI Joe cartoon.
62780	65780	Wasn't this supposed to be turned in several months ago?
65780	69780	Well, it airs Thursday.
69780	74780	So we're just got a couple more GI Joes to draw.
74780	78780	Wait, so you have an animated episode of Community that is...
78780	84780	When was that supposed to be in a properly functioning studio, network driven universe?
84780	86780	When was that supposed to be in?
86780	88780	Months ago, months ago.
88780	90780	You said that.
90780	92780	Now you're shocked by it.
92780	94780	Wasn't that supposed to be done months ago?
94780	96780	I don't know, months ago.
96780	98780	We're putting on a show here, Dan.
98780	102780	I'm trying to involve these people in the crisis that is your life right now.
102780	108780	Well, I don't do time. I'm not good with dates and things.
108780	110780	Certainly it's all my fault.
110780	111780	Which time was your show here?
111780	113780	Eight o'clock.
113780	116780	He does that time.
116780	122780	It's all my fault because I took too long to write the script and all that stuff.
122780	129780	So Shrob's kind of doing his Shrob thing and he's being an asshole.
129780	135780	It's like saying stuff on Twitter implying I should be there instead of being here.
135780	140780	If I went out to go do wedding plans with Aaron and then Rob was tweeting,
140780	145780	I hope you're having fun while I'm over here animating this and stuff.
145780	147780	So today I...
147780	150780	Oh, sweet.
150780	153780	You don't have this on your iPad, do you?
153780	157780	I might have it in my mail. Do you want me to try to open it in there?
158780	161780	Will it then play on their speakers better?
161780	162780	Let's see if I have money.
162780	170780	So today I went over and one of the last things I had to do was record the vocals for the G.I. Joe theme.
170780	174780	We had Jonathan Kimmel, who's Jimmy's brother,
174780	178780	we used him for some vocal stuff on the Sarah Silverman show back in the day.
178780	186780	He's a great singer and he's particularly good at this G.I. Joe register for that well-known theme song.
187780	189780	I have a question about it, but before we play it,
189780	193780	is that so close that you guys are in jeopardy of copyright infringement?
193780	197780	No, no, no. It's with their permission. Hasbro has been very cooperative.
197780	198780	Because it's the melody.
198780	200780	It's the absolute song, yeah.
200780	204780	Yeah, we're caught. It's G.I. Joe.
205780	207780	So I just did some alternate lyrics.
207780	211780	I think we're allowed to play this because it's like fair use or parody or something, right?
211780	212780	I just...
213780	218780	Our show? I play the Beatles and shit, man.
218780	221780	Yeah, I mean, it's a podcast. Let's hope we squeak by.
221780	224780	I mean, we're not going to make any money off of this or steal any money from anybody.
224780	227780	What would the season desist be? Stop doing that next week?
227780	231780	It's being leaked. It's like the Chevy voicemails. It's a leak.
231780	232780	Okay.
232780	234780	I don't know who's doing this.
235780	238780	TMZ, get your cameras out, right?
239780	241780	So I didn't even listen to the...
241780	244780	John Jonathan did the regular lyrics of the theme song,
244780	246780	because that's what people really want to hear.
246780	247780	But I ran in with...
247780	250780	I was like, can you do one more take and just do these alternate lyrics
250780	253780	so I can bring them back to the office to Schwab?
253780	257780	So this is punishing where Schwab was dutifully directing the episode
257780	261780	that you turned in too late, and he's working around the clock.
261780	262780	Yeah.
268780	271780	He tweets some bullshit whenever he's busy.
271780	276780	Schwab is an asshole. Schwab asshole.
276780	278780	Schwab asshole is there.
278780	281780	It's Robbie Schwab against all of humanity,
281780	283780	tweeting things all day.
283780	286780	He'll never be nice. He's always mean.
286780	289780	Eating his own poop and drinking his pee.
289780	292780	Schwab asshole.
292780	295780	Schwab asshole is there.
295780	298780	Schwab asshole is the code name for America's biggest,
298780	300780	dumbest poop-eating asshole.
300780	303780	His purpose? To tweet mean things at Dan Harmon,
303780	306780	a TV writer determined to entertain nice people.
306780	308780	I also suspect he hits his wife.
308780	311780	He makes you feel bad when you write a script plate.
311780	316780	Schwab is an asshole. Schwab asshole.
316780	320780	Schwab asshole.
320780	322780	Yeah!
323780	325780	All right.
330780	333780	It's a little unfair, but it's great that it's good.
333780	335780	It's a good song.
335780	337780	It's accurate.
337780	340780	I mean, it's very, very, you know,
340780	343780	he gets close to a deadline, and then he's like,
343780	346780	oh, I hate you. I hate you for, you know,
346780	348780	not turning the script on time or whatever.
348780	352780	It makes him feel better. It gets him going.
352780	355780	You know what's not healthy for me is a satisfied,
355780	359780	confident Schwab that feels sorry for me
359780	361780	or is loyal to me. That's dangerous.
361780	363780	Him running around out there. I don't know.
363780	367780	Why is that? I don't know. He's a devious guy.
367780	369780	You know?
369780	372780	Remember when Sarah fired me? Yeah.
372780	375780	He kept working there.
375780	378780	Is that what this is about?
378780	381780	Don't bury the lead, man.
381780	384780	There's always a little of that underneath everything.
384780	387780	You guys used to be inseparable best friends.
387780	390780	You guys still, I mean, you're not as close as you obviously were,
390780	392780	but what's the state of the union with this?
392780	394780	What do you mean? We're just close.
394780	396780	No, we had a year where we really,
396780	398780	we're really actually not talking to each other.
398780	400780	We were actually mad following the,
400780	402780	in the wake of the Sarah thing,
402780	407780	like I actually spent a year like kind of not liking him and stuff for real.
407780	409780	But then we made up.
409780	412780	When Mike Ash died, channel 101,
412780	419780	we were at a memorial service for a guy who ended his life doing channel 101
419780	421780	and it just felt like we're both there
421780	424780	and it just felt nobbish to continue to not like each other.
424780	427780	So we kind of made up there.
427780	430780	Yeah. Put it in your biopic.
431780	434780	And then you wrote that song today.
434780	436780	All right. I don't have anything.
436780	439780	I mean, in pop culture news.
441780	444780	I smell Bieber rant.
444780	446780	No, there's a goodie, by the way.
446780	449780	There's hashtag. The new thing now, Jeff, is hashtags.
449780	454780	You can use hashtags to cancel TV shows for being racist.
454780	457780	You can pick which show you think is racist
457780	460780	and you can hashtag cancel in the name of the show
460780	466780	and then voila, racism will go away.
467780	470780	Comedy will become incredibly sophisticated.
470780	472780	The whole species will become smarter
472780	477780	because obviously people that do that are all ready for really smart material
477780	479780	to go into their heads.
479780	484780	We're clearly at peak IQ as a nation here.
484780	486780	Yeah, it's just a new thing.
486780	489780	Do you have a, for instance, hashtag on your mind right now?
489780	493780	Well, I would like to submit hashtag cancel Teen Wolf.
493780	495780	I think Teen Wolf's racist.
496780	498780	It's on Mondays at 1030.
498780	500780	You know I created that show.
501780	503780	Aren't you racist?
503780	505780	Huh? As racist as the day is long.
505780	507780	Okay.
508780	513780	As Jeff Bryan Davis, not the creator of Teen Wolf,
513780	517780	who people still are convinced that I created the goddamn show
517780	521780	but I have never seen nor would under any fucking circumstance.
522780	525780	Every time I tell people that, I get more Teen Wolf followers.
525780	528780	And for some reason, in Portuguese,
529780	532780	I did a series of tweets again about how I didn't create it
532780	535780	but I started doing TNA or TNA.
537780	539780	I'm getting ahead of myself.
539780	542780	Teen Wolf Q&A, or as I call it, TNA.
543780	545780	Because my time is very valuable.
546780	548780	I answer questions about Teen Wolf as me
548780	550780	but people think that I am Jeff Davis,
550780	552780	creator of Criminal Minds and Teen Wolf.
552780	555780	And I just keep saying what a racist I am on high.
556780	561780	So cancel Teen Wolf and watch Rick and Morty on Mondays at 1030 instead.
563780	565780	That's my secret agenda.
565780	569780	Teen Wolf is the only show that gets higher ratings than Rick and Morty in our time slot.
570780	572780	Is that right? That's unfair.
572780	574780	Look, I think I've made it pretty clear.
574780	578780	I'm not too hip to the modern TV shows and music and stuff like that.
578780	580780	I fucking love Rick and Morty.
581780	585780	I watched it last week and I texted you about it, which I don't really do.
586780	589780	That show delights me. It makes me very happy.
589780	590780	Nice.
590780	591780	It's a good show.
591780	592780	It's really...
593780	594780	It's good.
595780	598780	And I think I can say that objectively
598780	602780	and like subtract my friendship with you and knowing Justin
602780	604780	and knowing everybody involved with it.
604780	607780	I think I would like that show in a vacuum just as much.
608780	610780	Like Futurama, like I've watched those and never did it.
611780	612780	Like there's other animated shows.
612780	613780	This is fucking goody.
613780	615780	I never really watched Futurama.
615780	616780	I heard it was really good.
616780	618780	I should go back and start watching it.
618780	620780	I'm sure it is. I just never got off the ground.
621780	625780	Okay, so I wanted to bring out some special friends
625780	628780	and kind of have a special show tonight
628780	631780	because we're going to take a little break for April.
633780	635780	I had a little chance.
635780	637780	I got a lot of shit going on.
637780	638780	That's not really why.
638780	640780	I can be busy and keep doing Harman Towns.
640780	642780	And I'll miss it as soon as we don't do it for a week.
642780	644780	But we're just going to take April off
644780	647780	because it's a show that never takes a hiatus.
647780	649780	Is this because Game of Thrones is also on Sunday?
649780	651780	Oh, no.
651780	653780	And then there's people tweeting.
653780	655780	Oh, shit, I'm coming in from Australia.
655780	657780	And I'm like, okay, I'll have a drink with you.
657780	660780	And then someone else says, I'm coming in from Texas.
660780	661780	Okay, I'll have a drink with you.
661780	664780	I'm going to have a busier month because I'm taking it off.
664780	668780	But I also just realized, you know, Aaron and I are now scheduling like a trip
668780	671780	to go to Cancun at some point.
671780	675780	And I think that might overlap with the arrival of Levi.
675780	678780	Remember Levi with the bare feet in the business?
678780	679780	How could I forget?
679780	681780	He's coming up here.
682780	685780	So then I saw that, and I was like, well, that guy's not going to take missing me.
685780	686780	Go to Cancun, Levi.
686780	688780	Take Levi to Cancun.
688780	690780	It's built for bare feet.
692780	698780	I feel like as long as the boat that's hitched to my car has at least one axle,
698780	701780	Levi will figure out a way to come down there.
701780	703780	Cape Fear reference.
703780	704780	Wow.
704780	706780	Okay.
706780	708780	Jesus.
708780	710780	Is that Robert Mitchum?
710780	712780	I'm referencing the De Niro movie.
712780	713780	De Niro.
713780	714780	Someone said both, I think, maybe.
714780	716780	I never saw the Mitchum one.
716780	719780	What a sizzler this tonight's show is.
719780	721780	Not that it's our job to sizzle.
721780	723780	I don't know.
723780	724780	We're a sizzler.
724780	725780	Okay.
725780	729780	I think iTunes called us the most notable sizzlers.
729780	731780	Are we on sizzlers?
731780	733780	I don't have a lot of time.
733780	735780	You don't have a lot of money?
735780	737780	Sizzler.
737780	739780	So in what order should we bring people up?
739780	740780	I say...
740780	741780	I say alphabetical.
741780	744780	I say first, is Dunk in here yet?
744780	745780	No.
745780	746780	Okay.
746780	747780	Spoiler.
747780	748780	Yeah.
748780	750780	Well, first let's bring out Kumail then.
759780	760780	Hello.
760780	761780	Hello.
762780	763780	Sorry.
763780	765780	Thank you for nailing that.
766780	770780	I have to say, the iPad's been a little spotty today.
770780	772780	I got to say, I've had that...
772780	775780	Because I was at Starburn's earlier today for some other thing,
775780	778780	and you played me that song, Shrava Asshole.
778780	780780	It's been stuck in my head.
780780	781780	It's really catchy.
781780	784780	If you see Rob on the street or something, really,
784780	786780	he'd really appreciate you.
786780	790780	That's why I emailed it to his wife and all his friends.
790780	793780	I've actually been doing fake lyrics to that melody all day long.
794780	796780	Cheddar cheese!
796780	798780	Favorite cheese on my sandwich?
798780	800780	Cheddar cheese is there.
800780	804780	It was so funny because you played it for me and Shrava was there,
804780	806780	and he's so good at that way.
806780	808780	He's like, oh, come on, guys.
808780	810780	Please, no, come on.
810780	815780	It was so funny to see his face as we're listening to this.
815780	817780	He loves being the victim.
817780	818780	He's so funny.
818780	821780	When he comes on the show, it's like, it's really fun to make fun of him.
821780	822780	It really is.
823780	825780	He makes it really fun.
825780	826780	He does.
826780	828780	He says stop doing it, but it's like...
832780	834780	Are your parents still in town?
835780	836780	Mine?
836780	837780	Yeah.
837780	839780	Oh, my parents-in-laws.
839780	840780	What do you say?
840780	843780	I was following your Instagrams, and I thought it was like your parents.
843780	845780	You thought I had white parents?
846780	848780	Are you not paying attention at all?
848780	849780	There were no photos.
849780	851780	I didn't see photos of your parents.
851780	855780	Just like the captions that said, like, my mom taking a picture of a thing.
855780	857780	Oh, yeah, that was Emily's mom.
857780	859780	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
859780	860780	Yes, they are still in town.
860780	861780	They're in town for...
861780	862780	Emily's wife?
863780	864780	Yeah, dude.
864780	865780	I scored.
868780	869780	Lucky devil.
870780	872780	We don't see race at Harmentown.
872780	874780	Yes, we fucking do.
874780	878780	Harmentown is a race-free zone,
879780	881780	which sounds bad.
882780	883780	Yeah.
883780	885780	Only one race allowed.
886780	887780	No races.
889780	892780	I think if you go back and listen to all the Harmentowns,
892780	895780	I think that statement will stand up.
896780	900780	I obsess about race because the rest of society gets tangled in it,
900780	901780	falters in it.
901780	904780	I, who see human beings as beacons of light,
905780	907780	try to study...
907780	909780	You're about to say the most racist thing yet.
911780	912780	Beacons of light.
914780	915780	He means white people.
916780	918780	Beacons of light with different accents.
920780	922780	Yeah, that cancel thing was really bugging me, too,
922780	926780	because it was Colbert and SNL were the two ones, right?
926780	927780	Yeah.
927780	928780	And it was for race stuff.
929780	936780	I invite people's decision to start pushing comedy
936780	939780	to be more sophisticated, but that's not.
939780	941780	You don't do that by canceling shows,
941780	943780	and you don't cancel shows with hashtags.
943780	944780	What is the hashtag?
944780	945780	Hashtag cancel it racist?
945780	946780	No, it's cancel.
947780	949780	You're terrible at coming up with hashtags.
949780	950780	It's got to be quick, buddy.
950780	952780	It's got to be snappy.
953780	954780	We only got 140 kyarkins.
954780	955780	Get to it.
955780	956780	What is the hashtag?
956780	957780	Cancel it racist?
958780	959780	Cancel it racist.
959780	960780	How is the racist?
960780	964780	Another hashtag, cancel Colbert and cancel SNL
964780	967780	are the two hashtags that I think Dan did before.
967780	969780	Why is race built into that hashtag?
969780	970780	Well, it's not.
970780	974780	It's just two things in a row happen
974780	977780	where the Twitter account for Colbert...
977780	980780	Which is not run by their writers.
980780	982780	Yeah, but also, yeah, whatever.
982780	986780	So there was a joke on there that was the first free joke
986780	989780	in, what, 20 years that that show's been at a Twitter account,
989780	991780	I guess, because it was like...
991780	993780	I don't know what the joke was, but it was like,
993780	995780	it really doesn't matter.
995780	998780	It was sort of interpreted as...
998780	999780	I know what the joke was,
999780	1002780	and it was just a quote from the show the night before,
1002780	1004780	and it was taken out of context and quoted.
1004780	1007780	And the point of it was, the owner of the Redskins,
1007780	1010780	they're like, sort of, you know how Colbert does?
1010780	1012780	So it's like, yeah, he's right.
1012780	1013780	He should have a racist whatever.
1013780	1014780	He's helping him.
1014780	1018780	And then it said, in the show he says,
1018780	1020780	and we have the...
1020780	1024780	I feel horrible saying it, but it's like,
1024780	1026780	we'll have the Ching Chong Bing Bong Foundation
1026780	1027780	to help Asian Americans.
1027780	1028780	That was what...
1028780	1031780	Hashtag cancel Camille Nanjiani.
1031780	1035780	I can't be racist. I'm not white.
1035780	1036780	That's racist.
1036780	1037780	No, it's not.
1037780	1038780	Yes, it is.
1039780	1040780	No, Camille, I'm white.
1040780	1042780	If I say it's racist, I'm right.
1042780	1043780	Fuck.
1043780	1045780	That's right.
1045780	1047780	So something like that, even if you don't...
1047780	1048780	You've learned nothing.
1048780	1049780	Yeah.
1049780	1051780	Even if you don't think the joke is funny,
1051780	1053780	you at least get what they're going for,
1053780	1054780	and it's not clearly...
1054780	1055780	Yeah, it's called satire,
1055780	1057780	which is lost on 95% of humanity.
1057780	1060780	And especially a new emerging group of people.
1060780	1062780	I hate to shake my Gen X cane again,
1062780	1064780	but it's just like,
1064780	1068780	did we go through some kind of censorship war
1068780	1071780	so we understand that it's always a bad idea
1071780	1075780	to start telling people what's right and wrong
1075780	1077780	to say for free on the internet?
1077780	1080780	Also, what I hate is, so when this was happening,
1080780	1082780	there were people sort of defending Colbert,
1082780	1083780	and there were so many people being like,
1083780	1085780	oh, you're white, you don't get to talk about this.
1085780	1088780	No, everybody gets to talk about it, right?
1088780	1092780	And also, comedy doesn't suffer any discussion at all.
1093780	1100780	And how much brilliant, fucking sophisticated comedy
1100780	1105780	is going to come out of these arbiters of comedy?
1105780	1109780	These are the most joyless fucking people in the world.
1109780	1112780	What are they going to replace bad jokes with?
1112780	1114780	They're not going to replace them with good ones.
1114780	1115780	No.
1115780	1117780	Like Sudoku?
1117780	1120780	Because they don't seem like bright people to me.
1121780	1124780	If you don't understand...
1124780	1128780	I understand not...
1128780	1131780	You guys caught that, too, right?
1131780	1136780	I understand if you get a...
1136780	1138780	I wish there was a way to describe this,
1138780	1142780	like the ironic racial humor,
1142780	1145780	where it's like, oh, I'm using the boomerang the wrong way
1145780	1148780	on purpose, blah, blah, blah, like racially.
1149780	1151780	Boomerang?
1151780	1153780	The oddities have gone down, too.
1153780	1155780	You're going to just take every race down.
1155780	1159780	We're all beacons of light, but some are less bright than others.
1159780	1163780	But honestly, the charge seems to be led by people who actually...
1163780	1166780	We're not even talking about the greatest jokes in the world,
1166780	1169780	and then we're talking about people who actually don't seem to get them.
1169780	1170780	Yes, exactly.
1170780	1175780	Who actually parse language in a joke word for word
1175780	1178780	and, like a spell check, like see a word
1178780	1181780	that they then connect a dot to offensiveness with
1181780	1184780	and then categorize the joke as therefore offensive.
1184780	1187780	Actually not getting the joke, and I'm not saying...
1187780	1189780	We're used to saying, if you don't get the joke,
1189780	1192780	then that means that the joke is so much more sophisticated than you.
1192780	1195780	Now we're talking about knock-knock jokes that people aren't getting
1195780	1197780	because they involve race.
1197780	1199780	It's like, knock-knock, who's there?
1199780	1200780	Black guy, black guy who?
1200780	1204780	Hey, I'm sorry I'm late because black people time stereotype.
1205780	1207780	Cancel Dan Harmon.
1208780	1212780	That's a bad, dumb, unsophisticated joke.
1212780	1215780	Just let them stop getting laughs.
1215780	1218780	It's really not hurting anybody.
1218780	1221780	And this idea that the television is going to somehow...
1221780	1226780	We're going to control television and make ourselves less racist
1226780	1229780	because then the things that we watch on the magic box
1229780	1231780	won't make us racist anymore.
1232780	1234780	All these racist people are just going to go outside
1234780	1236780	and make the outdoors racist.
1237780	1240780	If there's nothing racist to watch on TV anymore,
1240780	1241780	they're just going to...
1241780	1244780	I mean, isn't the problem that your neighbor is secretly racist
1244780	1247780	and he's just watching Big Bang Theory and going,
1247780	1249780	Yeah, I got that. I hate Jews.
1252780	1255780	I mean, don't you want that guy glued to the tube?
1255780	1257780	Do you want him in the woods?
1258780	1261780	You don't want him out there buying crosses and matches.
1263780	1266780	And isn't there actual racism happening somewhere?
1266780	1270780	Real racism, like actual ethnic cleansing
1270780	1272780	where someone goes up to a race and says,
1272780	1275780	Me no like your race because you're race bad.
1277780	1279780	And me want to eliminate.
1279780	1281780	Again, Dan, very problematic.
1282780	1284780	Japanese, Australian...
1284780	1286780	I was now the Chinese. Is anybody saying that?
1286780	1288780	That was a caveman, not an Asian.
1291780	1293780	You guys are racist.
1295780	1296780	Again.
1296780	1298780	Oh, I can't be racist.
1299780	1301780	He wasn't going to kill a bear.
1301780	1302780	Long time.
1303780	1305780	See now, okay, so there you go.
1306780	1309780	So we're in this realm where we're trading like pogs,
1309780	1312780	like examples of socially non-consciousness.
1312780	1315780	I think it's racist to assume that cavemen can't be Chinese.
1316780	1319780	Why can't they be Chinese cavemen? I'm sure there were.
1320780	1323780	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
1323780	1327780	They didn't sound like that.
1328780	1331780	You mean they didn't speak English with a Chinese accent?
1331780	1332780	Yeah.
1332780	1336780	Like somebody told them, you guys have to do this Chinese thing. I'm sorry.
1336780	1339780	Camille, and I don't want you to think about the consequences.
1339780	1342780	I'm going to ask, I'm going to give you a suggestion,
1342780	1344780	and I want you just to do it without considering the fallout.
1345780	1347780	This is the end of my career.
1348780	1351780	What would a Chinese caveman sound like?
1351780	1353780	I think you did that great.
1353780	1355780	We're both racist.
1356780	1357780	There was a movie.
1357780	1359780	But I can be racist.
1359780	1360780	I'm allowed to be racist.
1360780	1362780	No, you've proven that time and again.
1362780	1365780	Yeah, I make it look good, you know.
1366780	1368780	It's more allowed.
1368780	1374780	People that qualify as minority are allowed to be a little bit more...
1374780	1376780	No, I don't.
1376780	1380780	Listen, Pakistani people are very, very racist.
1380780	1383780	Which is a racist thing to say.
1384780	1387780	Wait, people are born racist.
1387780	1391780	I'm not saying this to be glib.
1391780	1394780	I have a friend who's Assyrian,
1394780	1397780	and his, what you would call your Polak jokes,
1397780	1401780	there are a certain neighboring country, and I forget what it is.
1401780	1404780	And that country's Polak joke is the Turkish.
1404780	1405780	Oh, yeah.
1405780	1406780	You just supplant...
1406780	1408780	Everybody's shitting on somebody else.
1408780	1412780	The worst premise of all time is, I grew up in Los Angeles.
1412780	1414780	I didn't know any Polish people.
1414780	1416780	If they were Polish, they were a fifth Polish.
1416780	1418780	But it's still on the playground.
1418780	1420780	Polish jokes had traction for some reason.
1420780	1423780	Yeah, we had our version of Polish jokes.
1423780	1424780	Who is it?
1424780	1426780	We called them Patan,
1426780	1429780	but it's basically the ethnicity that sort of lives in Afghanistan,
1429780	1432780	and the area of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan.
1432780	1434780	And they're called what?
1434780	1435780	We called them Patan.
1435780	1436780	So what's a Patan joke?
1436780	1439780	It would be like, how do the Patan tie his shoelaces?
1439780	1442780	And it would be that, you know, that thing, or...
1442780	1443780	Well, okay.
1443780	1444780	It's a visual joke.
1444780	1446780	Make it podcast friendly.
1446780	1449780	He lifted his shoe halfway and then reached out.
1449780	1451780	Because you're supposed to sit?
1451780	1454780	He puts one shoe in a chair and then reaches down to the other foot,
1454780	1455780	but he can't reach it.
1455780	1460780	Because he's a Patan, a dirty, dirty,
1460780	1462780	famously unintelligent classic.
1462780	1464780	Class the Patan.
1464780	1471780	Patan sounds like a Star Wars creature that you would ride around.
1471780	1476780	Yeah, I was too cold, so I killed a Patan and crawled inside him.
1476780	1478780	What were those things called?
1478780	1479780	Tontons.
1479780	1480780	Tontons.
1480780	1481780	Tontons.
1481780	1483780	We can't get away from this.
1483780	1486780	Hashtag, hashtag, cancel arm and tongue.
1486780	1491780	I'd rather sleep on a giant wanton than a filthy Patan.
1491780	1495780	I thought they smelled bad on the outside.
1499780	1502780	Your groans are too late.
1502780	1505780	You should have groaned at the beginning of this.
1505780	1509780	You should have groaned at Empire Strikes Back, I guess.
1509780	1511780	Smelled bad on the outside.
1511780	1513780	I think that was the perfect joke.
1513780	1515780	For that situation.
1515780	1521780	I want to end this segment, which I'll call, let's talk about race again.
1521780	1525780	On a positive note, I really do think it's like,
1525780	1527780	I don't want to be just knee-jerk and say,
1527780	1529780	don't tell me what to do, don't tell people what to say.
1529780	1531780	Slippery slope, you'll find out for yourself.
1531780	1534780	I'm 41, you can have this planet fuck off.
1534780	1537780	You'll find out on your own, kids.
1537780	1541780	But also, I think if you want to clean up the planet,
1541780	1544780	and even if you just want to clean up comedy, that's fucking good.
1544780	1546780	But that's called being a comedy snob.
1546780	1550780	First thing you better do is go watch Four Seasons of Mr. Show.
1550780	1554780	Then you should, I don't know, read some books that make you laugh
1554780	1557780	or watch all the Woody Allen movies, I don't know.
1557780	1560780	Become a student of fucking comedy.
1560780	1564780	Become a millennial Sid Caesar and start telling people
1564780	1566780	which jokes are funny and which ones aren't.
1566780	1570780	And let the whole, you know, the crutch that is racial comedy,
1570780	1571780	the hot button.
1571780	1574780	You know, because if I had one leg and I came out on stage
1574780	1576780	and I said, I know what you guys are thinking,
1576780	1578780	something about my one leg.
1578780	1580780	I would learn as a one-legged comic,
1580780	1582780	I would have the choice of like,
1582780	1584780	there would be a temptation to go to that well.
1584780	1589780	And whether you belong to the minority in question or not,
1589780	1592780	like racial comedy has a kind of like, you know,
1592780	1594780	it gets a reaction out of people because it's on our minds
1594780	1595780	and stuff like that.
1595780	1597780	And there's intelligent racial comedy,
1597780	1599780	and there's lowbrow racial comedy,
1599780	1601780	and there's downright racist racial comedy,
1601780	1603780	and there's everything in between.
1603780	1607780	But if you want to police comedy, like great.
1607780	1610780	Like here's your lightsaber, here's your robe,
1610780	1612780	like here's your blast shield.
1612780	1615780	Like you just took your first step into a world where you're not
1615780	1617780	going to get a lot of jokes for a while.
1617780	1620780	Because if you're starting your comedy analyzation career
1620780	1624780	being so dumb that you think that shows should be canceled
1624780	1628780	and it can be on Twitter, then I bet you're going to find out
1628780	1632780	that you don't want your jokes to be too much smarter.
1632780	1635780	How does like, where does that, if somebody writes,
1635780	1637780	cancels this, who started that thing?
1637780	1642780	Well, the one for, yeah, it was, you started it?
1642780	1645780	A gal in the front row raised her hand.
1645780	1648780	I think for the Colbert, it was a lady.
1648780	1650780	Sui Park.
1650780	1653780	She's a Korean-American woman, and she started it satirically.
1653780	1654780	No, she didn't.
1654780	1656780	I read an article that she wrote today, right?
1656780	1658780	It's fine, yeah.
1658780	1659780	Yeah, she is not being...
1659780	1660780	Or a different girl.
1660780	1662780	Sui Park, she's not being...
1662780	1663780	Can you not tell them apart?
1664780	1666780	Wow.
1669780	1672780	For the record, Adam Goldberg also a racist.
1674780	1676780	But accusing others of racism.
1676780	1678780	This is, yeah, we all fall apart.
1678780	1680780	Which is a good thing.
1680780	1683780	Fall apart, let's deconstruct, let's be interested in each other
1683780	1685780	and what makes us laugh and what's appropriate.
1685780	1689780	The way the internet works and everybody wants as many retweets
1689780	1696780	and likes and, you know, like, they want as much feedback as possible.
1696780	1700780	Like, is it possible that people just do things that are clearly
1700780	1702780	going to create energy?
1702780	1703780	Yeah.
1703780	1704780	That's exactly it, yes.
1704780	1707780	And so they're not really taking any bold stance.
1707780	1709780	Well, no, that's the thing.
1709780	1710780	That's the outrageous thing.
1710780	1711780	No one's doing anything.
1711780	1713780	They're not creating anything.
1713780	1715780	They're just attacking stuff that other people are doing.
1715780	1718780	You're not really doing anything constructive.
1718780	1722780	The thing I read didn't make it seem like she did it as a satirical thing.
1722780	1724780	She seemed very serious about it.
1724780	1728780	I saw, I followed her yesterday because she started getting a little bit,
1728780	1730780	like, racist in a different way.
1730780	1732780	It's like a whole different, like, Native American thing.
1732780	1733780	What?
1733780	1736780	But, yeah, she said, yeah, no, because it was just about Natives.
1736780	1737780	Yeah, it was.
1737780	1738780	It wasn't a Native American thing.
1738780	1741780	Yeah, she's like, I helped, like, Indigenous people like this.
1741780	1744780	And, like, instead of saying, like, yeah, I did take attention away from that.
1744780	1745780	Sorry.
1745780	1746780	Oh, yeah.
1746780	1747780	Yeah.
1747780	1748780	All right.
1748780	1750780	Yeah, she was saying, like, this was satirical.
1750780	1753780	And also, like, Colbert is a millionaire white dude.
1753780	1754780	He'll be fine.
1754780	1757780	She's saying, like, hundreds of, like, per hour,
1757780	1759780	she's getting hundreds of, like, rape and death threats.
1759780	1760780	Okay, that is wrong.
1760780	1762780	She shouldn't be getting rape and death threats.
1762780	1765780	But she did sort of start this thing.
1765780	1767780	No, I'm not saying she asked for it.
1767780	1768780	I'm not.
1768780	1769780	Oh, God.
1769780	1770780	That's the end of the segment.
1770780	1771780	Thank you.
1772780	1773780	Oh.
1776780	1780780	This show brought to you by Chinese cavemen.
1782780	1787780	Yeah, I can't be racist, but misogyny, that goes well with this color.
1787780	1788780	All right.
1802780	1807780	I wish there was some kind of, like, machine that could actually measure
1807780	1809780	genuine offensiveness.
1809780	1813780	You know, like, actual offense that a person is actually taking.
1813780	1817780	Like, because it's become an exercise.
1817780	1822780	Dino's Tamatopolis said that society obviously peaked with the invention of dessert
1822780	1824780	and that we were weird.
1824780	1827780	Because we were now, there was a part of your meal that you were just like,
1827780	1830780	I'm not hungry anymore, but...
1830780	1833780	That's the thing that is worst for me.
1833780	1840780	And I think the dessert of culture has become, I mean, our culture.
1840780	1844780	And in parts of the world where, again, there are parts of our country, fuck it,
1844780	1846780	where there is actual racism going on.
1846780	1851780	But, like, we sitting in our chairs at our laptops, tweeting and hashtagging,
1851780	1856780	this is intellectual dessert, talking about what's offensive to someone else
1856780	1857780	and what is not.
1857780	1860780	I wish there was a way to actually get out a yardstick and really measure,
1860780	1863780	like, genuine off offense.
1863780	1866780	Yeah, like, listen, you're only a two on this.
1866780	1870780	And I wish there was a different word for P's and Q's,
1870780	1876780	like, violations that were technical violations, party fouls, if you will.
1876780	1881780	So is there some kind of word for something that absolutely isn't even coming close
1881780	1886780	to hurting anybody in any way and yet, you know, could be a valid topic of conversation
1886780	1889780	if we want to be such high-minded comedy snobs
1889780	1892780	and talk about what's proper comedy and not?
1892780	1896780	Because that's the other thing is, like, well, I mean,
1896780	1900780	a woman who's being tweeted hundreds of thousands of rape and death threats,
1900780	1905780	that sounds possibly distorted, like, I can't even picture
1905780	1908780	a hundred thousand rape and death threats, like, scrolling through them.
1908780	1915780	But I'm certain that there's a lot of idiots in the world that react,
1915780	1919780	that are having the same unease that I'm feeling,
1919780	1923780	but are really terrible people and who are, like, then want to go, like,
1923780	1927780	I want to hit you in the face with a rock because you're a bad person
1927780	1929780	and I'm a bad person, all this terrible shit.
1929780	1935780	Like, it is offensive for somebody to, like, tweet at you that they're going to murder you
1935780	1940780	or sexually assault you to humble you and put you back in your place.
1940780	1944780	People think I created Teen Wolf and I'm getting rape and death threats.
1945780	1947780	People like that show, by the way.
1947780	1949780	A lot of people really like Teen Wolf.
1949780	1951780	Congrats, buddy.
1953780	1954780	I'm sure it's a great show.
1954780	1960780	If I go by the vitriolic praise and the superlative praise
1960780	1963780	and the vitriolic hate that I get as a wrong person,
1963780	1966780	and now I've changed my bio on Twitter, I did not create Teen Wolf.
1966780	1970780	Now that people can click on that, I just, I don't know how that came to be,
1970780	1973780	but it's really, like, I just think it should be canceled.
1973780	1977780	I think the 10-30 Monday night slot should be cleared of racist television.
1978780	1981780	Let Rick and Morty stand for him.
1981780	1982780	Dan, can I come clean a little bit?
1982780	1983780	Yeah.
1983780	1985780	I actually did create Teen Wolf.
1987780	1989780	You finally figured out a way to get my attention.
1989780	1993780	And I, you have my guarantee as a creator of a television show that you love and adore
1993780	1995780	that there will be no pitons on it.
1997780	1998780	No Chinese cavemen.
1999780	2000780	I'm a racist.
2001780	2002780	I want to be a piton.
2002780	2004780	It's a sense of sci-fi.
2005780	2006780	Give me one more baton joke.
2006780	2010780	The baton people will not be denied their destiny.
2014780	2016780	That it takes ten of them to change a light bulb.
2018780	2023780	It'll be like, you know, like a Polish joke, like how does a baton...
2023780	2024780	No, no, no, I'm doing the joke.
2024780	2026780	Camille just pulled out of Notebook.
2027780	2032780	A standard Camille is leather-bound joke book.
2032780	2034780	Just off the top of my head.
2036780	2037780	No, I mean...
2039780	2040780	Let me look.
2040780	2042780	Yeah, I mean, you're doing this shit for years.
2042780	2044780	It's bombing. Nobody knows what batons are here.
2045780	2046780	It's under P.
2046780	2047780	No, it'll be...
2047780	2049780	Yeah, this is the baton Notebook.
2050780	2055780	No, it'll be like, you know that joke, like how does a baton turn pages?
2055780	2060780	It'll be like, you know, I don't have the manual dexterity for it.
2063780	2064780	That's exactly...
2064780	2067780	He's licking one finger as if in preparation to turn a page
2067780	2071780	while his other hand deftly turns the page's sans-licked finger.
2071780	2072780	No, but see, that's...
2072780	2073780	That's like Mort from work.
2073780	2075780	But that's interesting because that also...
2075780	2077780	And I forget which Marx Brothers film.
2079780	2081780	I think it's Harpo or Chica.
2081780	2082780	Harpo Marx's Dealing Bridge.
2082780	2083780	Patano.
2084780	2085780	And he licks...
2085780	2087780	He has the deck in his left hand and he licks his right thumb.
2087780	2088780	It just deals with his left hand.
2088780	2089780	Uh-huh.
2089780	2090780	Yeah.
2090780	2093780	There's a way to be high status in that joke and a way to be low status in that joke.
2093780	2095780	Yeah, so this is the...
2095780	2096780	It's just the standard.
2096780	2101780	But then also, for any of you old enough to have been around when Dan Quayle was vice president,
2101780	2103780	he inherited all Polish jokes.
2103780	2104780	Anybody...
2104780	2105780	Well, he wrote a lot of new ones.
2107780	2108780	He's Polish?
2108780	2109780	No, no, no.
2109780	2110780	He just...
2110780	2113780	He was just finally like, well, give the Polish people a break.
2113780	2115780	We found an actual...
2115780	2116780	We found an avatar.
2116780	2120780	We found a person who actually walks around with a car door so that if it gets hot,
2120780	2121780	he can roll the window down.
2122780	2123780	And he's our vice president.
2125780	2129780	Is it true that Dan Quayle once tried to spray graffiti on a chain link fence?
2130780	2131780	Is that true?
2131780	2132780	Yes.
2132780	2133780	Is it?
2133780	2134780	It was a chain link fence.
2134780	2142780	He directed with his own hammer and nails, and I saw him throwing several of the nails away.
2142780	2144780	He kept looking at them.
2145780	2148780	And I said, why are you throwing some of the nails away?
2148780	2153780	And he said, the point is facing the wrong side.
2153780	2154780	Yeah.
2154780	2156780	The head's on the wrong side.
2157780	2161780	Please cross-reference the earlier Harman Tamara, Dan can't tell a joke.
2162780	2164780	I don't know how to tell a joke.
2164780	2165780	Is that right?
2166780	2169780	Have you heard the moment Dan tries to tell the duck joke?
2169780	2171780	I can't tell jokes either.
2171780	2172780	I can't do street jokes.
2172780	2173780	What's the duck joke?
2173780	2174780	Oh, I'll tell you.
2179780	2184780	There's a guy who walks... Dan Harmon can't tell jokes.
2185780	2186780	I have the same problem.
2186780	2187780	All right.
2187780	2188780	There's a guy that walks into...
2188780	2189780	Dan, before you start, before you start.
2190780	2191780	Hang on.
2191780	2194780	I'm not trying to ice you like a field goal kicker right now.
2195780	2199780	Camille, for those of you that are coming in late to this party,
2201780	2204780	Dan, I want you to... You've told this joke a bunch of times.
2204780	2208780	I want you to non-ironically tell it as straight and as simple as...
2208780	2209780	I'm going to.
2209780	2210780	Do a joke.
2210780	2211780	Just tell us the joke.
2211780	2214780	Yeah, just take it right across the goal line.
2215780	2218780	Dan Harmon now presents the duck joke.
2219780	2228780	Okay, so this guy goes to a whore house and he goes to the matron of the...
2230780	2233780	And he wants a whore for money and he says,
2233780	2237780	I only have a dollar.
2240780	2242780	But is that enough for a whore?
2243780	2244780	Goddamn it.
2245780	2247780	You're distracting me with your...
2248780	2249780	We'll be right back.
2250780	2253780	For more Dan Harmon, tell us the duck joke.
2254780	2258780	The person says, the owner of the whore house says...
2258780	2259780	The matron.
2259780	2263780	The matron says, for a dollar, you get a duck.
2263780	2264780	You get this duck.
2265780	2266780	Okay, that's all you get.
2266780	2267780	That's all you get.
2269780	2271780	And he goes, okay.
2271780	2277780	And he takes it upstairs and he comes back down later and with the duck
2277780	2279780	and he gives the duck back and he says, I had a wonderful time.
2279780	2283780	That was a great duck sex session.
2284780	2290780	And he leaves and he may mutter something about, man, I got to come back.
2290780	2292780	Because then he does the next day.
2292780	2294780	It doesn't matter that he said...
2294780	2296780	There's so much unnecessary detail.
2296780	2298780	I know, but he does...
2299780	2307780	And now, the shocking conclusion that Dan Harmon tells the duck joke.
2308780	2314780	So he comes back the next day and he's got his dollar.
2314780	2315780	He's all excited.
2315780	2319780	He's like, yeah, I didn't even bother to bring more because...
2320780	2321780	Well, fuck that duck.
2321780	2322780	Oh, no.
2325780	2330780	When I say conclusion, I mean the conclusion.
2331780	2334780	And he goes, I'll have the duck, please.
2334780	2338780	And she gives him the duck and he didn't...
2338780	2339780	I fucked one thing up.
2339780	2341780	He didn't give her a dollar yet.
2341780	2342780	He just came...
2342780	2343780	He just did that.
2343780	2347780	He just came bounding in and said, I'll have the duck, please.
2347780	2350780	And the matron gives him the duck.
2350780	2351780	He goes upstairs.
2351780	2352780	He comes back down.
2352780	2354780	She says, that'll be seven dollars.
2354780	2356780	And he goes, seven dollars?
2356780	2358780	It only cost a dollar yesterday.
2358780	2363780	And the prostitute matron says, yesterday's duck...
2363780	2364780	Fuck.
2364780	2365780	God damn it.
2367780	2368780	It feels...
2368780	2369780	Wait, wait, wait.
2369780	2370780	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
2370780	2371780	Wait, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
2371780	2373780	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
2373780	2375780	This is excruciating.
2375780	2379780	It feels like you're coming up with the joke as you're telling it.
2379780	2381780	And also learning the English language.
2383780	2385780	He comes down.
2385780	2388780	He gives back the duck and she says, that'll be seven dollars.
2388780	2393780	And he says, this duck...
2393780	2395780	He says, this...
2395780	2397780	This guy writes TV comedy for a living.
2397780	2398780	He says, okay, okay.
2398780	2399780	I figured out how to word it.
2399780	2402780	He says, he hands the duck back and he says, here's the duck back.
2402780	2404780	Well, why didn't he give the duck back?
2404780	2405780	Because this is the next day.
2405780	2406780	Come on, come on.
2406780	2407780	He doesn't have the duck yet.
2407780	2408780	What do you mean?
2408780	2409780	He took it upstairs.
2409780	2410780	He had sex with it.
2410780	2411780	The second day?
2411780	2412780	Seven dollars.
2412780	2413780	He paid the seven.
2413780	2414780	No, he didn't pay the seven.
2414780	2415780	He's coming down with it.
2415780	2416780	It's pay afterward.
2416780	2417780	Okay.
2417780	2420780	It's one of those pay afterward whorehouses.
2420780	2421780	Go ahead.
2421780	2423780	So he gives the duck back.
2423780	2426780	The whole prostitution industry is based on trust.
2426780	2432780	There's only one door to the whorehouse and it's a small town and it's not worth it.
2432780	2435780	You'll be blacklisted from...
2435780	2438780	The matrons talk to each other.
2438780	2442780	If the whores don't have trust, what do they have?
2442780	2448780	This is a region of the country and a time in our history when prostitution isn't like...
2448780	2456780	It's not respectful to women, but it's also not as frowned upon as an industry.
2456780	2460780	And therefore, there is no oversight.
2460780	2463780	So he brings the duck down.
2463780	2465780	On the second day, he went upstairs with it.
2465780	2466780	He brings it down.
2466780	2467780	He gives it to the woman.
2467780	2469780	This is only the second day?
2469780	2470780	No, no, no, no.
2470780	2471780	There's only two days.
2471780	2472780	I'm with you.
2472780	2473780	I'm with you.
2473780	2476780	He gives it back and she says, that'll be $7.
2476780	2479780	And he says, that's seven times as much as yesterday's duck.
2479780	2482780	And she says, that duck didn't have AIDS.
2489780	2491780	That was Dan Herman of Tell the Duck Show.
2491780	2493780	A worth the wait production.
2494780	2498780	You should have said, this duck doesn't have AIDS.
2498780	2500780	No, but why is it more expensive then?
2500780	2503780	Because it doesn't have AIDS.
2503780	2505780	Oh, right, right, right.
2505780	2507780	You don't want to fuck the AIDS duck.
2507780	2509780	You don't want to fuck the AIDS duck.
2509780	2510780	Wait, no.
2510780	2512780	So he says, this duck.
2512780	2514780	I had to say that duck.
2514780	2515780	The joke goes like this.
2515780	2516780	A guy goes to her house.
2516780	2518780	So the guy goes, that duck didn't have AIDS.
2518780	2520780	It was so cheap.
2520780	2522780	No, and she goes, this duck doesn't have AIDS.
2522780	2524780	He's like, oh, it's, oh, okay, I get it.
2524780	2525780	That guy goes to her house.
2525780	2526780	He says, all I have is a dollar.
2526780	2527780	What can I get?
2527780	2528780	You can't get much.
2528780	2529780	And she hands him a duck.
2529780	2530780	And he goes, a duck.
2530780	2531780	And she goes, that's all you get for a dollar.
2531780	2532780	He goes upstairs.
2532780	2533780	He comes back down.
2533780	2534780	He goes, you know what?
2534780	2535780	Not bad.
2535780	2536780	He goes back to the next day.
2536780	2537780	And he said, I'll take the duck again.
2537780	2538780	So he goes, fuck the duck.
2538780	2539780	And she goes, that'll be $5.
2539780	2540780	And he goes, $5.
2540780	2541780	It was a dollar yesterday.
2541780	2542780	Because, yeah, but this duck doesn't have AIDS.
2542780	2543780	Yeah.
2543780	2544780	Yeah.
2545780	2551780	Well, congratulations.
2551780	2555780	You're good at something silly.
2555780	2557780	All right.
2557780	2559780	Creating mercy.
2559780	2560780	No, just so you know.
2560780	2561780	No, but it's funny.
2561780	2562780	You can't tell a joke.
2562780	2564780	Jay Johnston and Dino Samitopoulos.
2564780	2568780	Three of the funniest people I know cannot tell joke jokes.
2568780	2573780	Does it help that in my head the whole time all the characters were Asian in this joke?
2573780	2576780	What does that say about me?
2576780	2577780	Racist.
2577780	2578780	No.
2578780	2581780	They weren't, like, stereotypical Asian.
2581780	2585780	But you're saying that you're not going to tell straight jokes as well?
2585780	2586780	No, I can't do.
2586780	2587780	I think I'm doing a good job.
2587780	2589780	But at the end, nobody laughs.
2589780	2591780	And I just, then I have to, like, I think.
2591780	2596780	I have to say, like, the most nervous I think I ever get in the year is telling a joke.
2596780	2598780	And even doing that just now, the joke I know.
2598780	2600780	Yeah, it's very nerve wracking.
2600780	2602780	It raises, like, my heart rate goes up.
2602780	2603780	My left hand starts to tingle.
2603780	2606780	Because if you say one wrong thing, you can fuck the whole thing.
2606780	2607780	That's the thing that fucks me up.
2607780	2611780	Like, I end up, like, off-roading because I'm, like, I'm trying not to drive wrong.
2611780	2613780	I'm, like, I get really nervous.
2613780	2617780	But you get bogged down in miscellaneous and extraneous detail.
2617780	2621780	Well, because my favorite part, I have to say, is when the guy comes in for the first time
2621780	2624780	and he says, I want to buy a whore for money.
2624780	2627780	I think the whore money detail was probably...
2627780	2628780	Right.
2628780	2629780	Well, I wasn't, yeah.
2629780	2630780	Also, Matron.
2630780	2631780	I liked Matron.
2631780	2632780	That was good.
2632780	2633780	That was a great detail.
2633780	2634780	Did you mean Madam?
2634780	2635780	Yeah, I guess.
2635780	2636780	I meant Madam.
2636780	2637780	But you're...
2637780	2638780	I think that you're...
2638780	2644780	Like, karaoke, I do karaoke because karaoke makes me nervous.
2644780	2648780	I could go on stage, like, nude at the Hollywood Bowl.
2648780	2650780	And I don't think I'd be that nervous.
2650780	2652780	Karaoke gets me, like, I don't...
2652780	2654780	But you're really great at karaoke.
2654780	2657780	Well, I can sing, but I don't want those people that can get up there and, like, perform.
2657780	2659780	Vamp with a free hand, like, flying around.
2659780	2660780	I hold the mic with both hands.
2660780	2661780	No, you're really good at it, though.
2661780	2666780	Well, I can sing, but, like, I don't feel comfortable up on stage doing karaoke for some reason.
2666780	2667780	Okay.
2667780	2668780	Yeah, I don't do karaoke.
2668780	2669780	I'm not good at it.
2669780	2670780	I can't do it.
2670780	2671780	But, like, stand up, I do.
2671780	2672780	And I tell jokes.
2672780	2674780	But only if it's jokes I've written.
2674780	2676780	I can't do other people's songs or anything.
2676780	2678780	Tell somebody else's joke.
2678780	2679780	No, I'm kidding.
2679780	2680780	Okay.
2680780	2688780	There's a guy, he goes to the whorehouse, and there's only one door in the whorehouse.
2688780	2696780	The matron, who's there, and they say matron because English is not their first language.
2696780	2703780	They're learning English, and they're performing this transaction.
2703780	2707780	I also love when you came back the next day, and you did the whole thing.
2707780	2708780	Seven dollars!
2708780	2709780	That's too much!
2709780	2710780	Oh, wait, no, okay.
2710780	2711780	Forget that.
2711780	2712780	He just takes the duck.
2712780	2713780	He just takes the duck.
2713780	2717780	And then he comes down, and then it's seven dollars.
2717780	2722780	I mean, that joke telling had so many gifts to give.
2722780	2729780	Although, even with our interruptions and interjections, you told that joke half as long as you did the last time you told me.
2729780	2730780	Yeah.
2730780	2734780	There was a guy on the Harmontown tour.
2734780	2737780	He had a t-shirt that he had made.
2737780	2740780	It's filled with text, and it's me trying to tell the duck joke.
2740780	2742780	It's pretty great.
2742780	2743780	All right.
2743780	2746780	Let's do our medical corner.
2746780	2747780	Boom!
2747780	2748780	Boom!
2748780	2749780	Boom!
2749780	2750780	Boom!
2750780	2751780	Boom!
2751780	2752780	Boom!
2752780	2753780	Boom!
2753780	2754780	Boom!
2754780	2755780	Boom!
2755780	2756780	Medical corner.
2756780	2757780	Okay.
2757780	2758780	All right.
2758780	2764780	You know who we haven't seen in a long, long time and haven't checked in on him, and he has a dramatic update.
2764780	2766780	Our good friend, Seek Donnelly.
2766780	2767780	All right.
2767780	2768780	Boom!
2768780	2769780	Boom!
2769780	2770780	Boom!
2770780	2771780	Boom!
2771780	2772780	Boom!
2772780	2773780	Boom!
2773780	2774780	Boom!
2774780	2775780	Bang argument not the power.
2775780	2776780	Boom!
2776780	2777780	Boom!
2777780	2778780	Boom!
2778780	2779780	Bang babies got the power.
2779780	2782780	Bangies got the power.
2782780	2797780	Seek, Seek for those who don't know is multiple aneurysm survivor who we had established last time he, because of his strange condition,
2797780	2807780	his proclivity for something that is catastrophic to anyone when it occurs randomly, he has a proclivity for aneurysms
2807780	2818780	and these doctors, like, were cutting you a deal where they said, well, because that's so weird, we'll give you free kind of treatment,
2818780	2823780	but it's for our purposes, it's for our studying and stuff like that.
2823780	2830780	And you've got your own neurologist as well, but you were just telling me in the green room, do you want to take it from there?
2830780	2838780	Well, sure, yeah, so one of the things I lost that I think I said in previous shows was my visual memory,
2838780	2846780	and so what that does is it cuts down on my short-term memory a lot and it also makes it really hard, I'm an artist, so it makes me really hard to create artwork.
2846780	2853780	And so the pieces I did for Harmontown, where you guys are all Mega Man characters, I actually had nosebleeds trying to create that art.
2853780	2855780	Those are wonderful.
2855780	2859780	Oh, thank you. I had fun doing an indoor kids one with you and Emily.
2859780	2865780	And so it takes a lot out of me to create things, but I don't like being told I can't do stuff,
2865780	2873780	so these doctors that I've been seeing for a couple years now, I had another coiling procedure done in November,
2873780	2877780	and since then they've kind of laid off some of the tests they normally do on me,
2877780	2884780	and in that time period where it was a longer period than I usually have between tests,
2884780	2889780	I started, at least I thought, having some visual sense coming back.
2889780	2894780	So I had a dream one night, and I haven't had a dream in a long time.
2894780	2898780	I haven't had a dream in a long time.
2898780	2901780	That's not how you sound. Jeff, stop doing that.
2902780	2905780	I'm just saying he's stealing from Morrissey right now.
2905780	2907780	Oh, who?
2910780	2911780	Visual memory.
2911780	2912780	What is coiling?
2912780	2913780	What is coiling?
2913780	2920780	Coiling is a procedure, though, where they go up, it depends on where they feel the best is,
2920780	2925780	but sometimes they go up in your inner thigh and they run a calf that are up your entire body.
2925780	2926780	What?
2926780	2928780	That's the fastest way to get there?
2928780	2932780	No, it's not the fastest, but it's one of the options, yeah.
2932780	2936780	So they're like, either we could start up here or we could do the thigh.
2936780	2937780	We could do the thigh.
2937780	2942780	No, well, that was my option, so yeah.
2942780	2945780	So they're writing up like an artery or a vein or something like that?
2945780	2948780	Yeah, yeah, and then they go straight up.
2948780	2949780	Good heavens.
2949780	2957780	And then they put these coils into kind of clip and direct the aneurysms,
2957780	2959780	and to drain them sometimes, too.
2959780	2962780	So they'll put them in and hold them in place.
2962780	2968780	So since I have multiple ones that keep growing, they have to do this procedure more often than they do.
2968780	2971780	So for no one comes up to go in and take care of these coils?
2971780	2974780	Yeah, well, I think the last two times, I didn't get one at a time.
2974780	2976780	I got like two or three.
2976780	2980780	So the last time I went in, I got 14 coils put in.
2980780	2982780	And then they stay there?
2982780	2984780	Yeah, I mean for a while.
2984780	2986780	Over time, some of them dissolve.
2987780	2990780	Yeah, so they ran these tests.
2990780	2993780	So I had this dream, and then I was trying to explain the dream.
2993780	2998780	And they were like, well, because I have trouble saying things visually, I was having trouble explaining the dream.
2998780	2999780	But I knew I had one.
2999780	3001780	So then they're like, oh, it's probably nothing, you know, whatever.
3001780	3002780	So I said, OK.
3002780	3006780	So then in like a week or two later, I could have sworn I had another dream.
3006780	3011780	And then I said, OK, now I'm starting to connect a really major dot here.
3011780	3018780	After my aneurysm, there was a time when I was like writing and stuff again that I would draw, like doodle a little bit.
3018780	3020780	And then since then, I've been under this program.
3020780	3023780	And that whole time, it's been really hard for me to draw.
3023780	3027780	And I felt neutered by the medication and stuff they've been doing to me.
3027780	3030780	I felt like it was stopping me from creating.
3030780	3037780	So I basically told them, hey, look, before we run any more tests, I'd like some time off to see if I have more dreams, if I get more visual sense.
3037780	3042780	And then so what ended up happening in that time off was I sculpted something.
3042780	3044780	I started writing a song.
3044780	3045780	I started painting.
3045780	3048780	And I'm still having trouble with the visuals.
3048780	3050780	And it's still hard for me to do these things.
3050780	3052780	But the neat thing is that or not the song so much.
3052780	3059780	But the neat thing is is that I'm conquering it like I'm beating, I think, whatever this wall was that I was hitting.
3059780	3065780	So recently, I told those doctors like, hey, I appreciate all the help, but I want out of this program.
3065780	3070780	And they're like, well, we advise against that because they paid for a lot of my medical treatment.
3070780	3073780	They're like, you make no money at all.
3073780	3080780	And even less than a normal artist because none of my stuff sells and it's all for charity.
3080780	3084780	Yeah, that's a terrible business plan for me.
3084780	3085780	I'm not making money.
3085780	3086780	I'm donating all of it.
3086780	3089780	Well, it's funny that my last two jobs have been marketing jobs.
3089780	3091780	And I'm like, I don't know how to pay my own bills.
3091780	3094780	Why are you having me to pay your bills?
3094780	3096780	So I just like creating.
3096780	3098780	And I feel like that's my purpose.
3098780	3104780	So I've made the decision, well, even if this kills me not having you doctors around, I want to create this project.
3104780	3110780	So I started this project that was inspired by Harmontown because this is the only I listen to this podcast religiously.
3110780	3113780	Even I've seen I heard every episode like 10 or 20 times.
3113780	3115780	And I feel like this is my family.
3115780	3116780	This is my home.
3116780	3123780	These people who understand me, who don't judge me in a negative way and who also help me create art, like create those prints for you guys.
3123780	3126780	And so I wanted to do a big love letter to that.
3126780	3134780	And the type of people we have come up here, like Jane, who our earth shine friend, he has some earth shine kit.
3134780	3135780	Follow him on Twitter.
3135780	3136780	He'll tell you about it.
3136780	3137780	And then we have Levi.
3137780	3139780	And you have these people who are really great people.
3139780	3142780	And they are in search for an identity.
3142780	3146780	And I feel like that's what I'm in search for because my memories of childhood are gone.
3146780	3150780	I remember up to about six, seven years ago.
3150780	3151780	Really?
3152780	3154780	You don't have any memories of when you were okay?
3154780	3157780	I have some knowledge of them, but most of them are gone.
3157780	3161780	So when you say there's no visual memory, you can't picture your elementary school.
3161780	3162780	You can't.
3162780	3163780	No, no.
3163780	3164780	Or my mom.
3164780	3165780	Really?
3165780	3166780	Yeah.
3166780	3171780	So that's why me and my mom have such a weird relationship now is because she always says, don't don't you remember when you do this?
3171780	3172780	Don't you remember that?
3172780	3177780	And I it breaks my heart every time to tell her that I don't because then I see the look on her face.
3177780	3182780	Do you feel that now that it's kind of trickling back in like your visual sense that that maybe memories might come?
3182780	3183780	I'm hoping.
3183780	3184780	And that's why I want to explore it.
3184780	3191780	And like I said, I'm it's if anything's worth dying for, it's it's to find out who you are.
3191780	3194780	You know, so I said, well, OK, so I don't want to die.
3194780	3198780	I don't I have my one neurologist, but everyone else I'm like, you can all go away.
3198780	3200780	Like, let me explore this.
3200780	3202780	Let me see how deep this pool is.
3202780	3203780	That's amazing.
3203780	3209780	And were they barking at it because they saw you as an investment for their own research that I mean, they put a lot of effort and money into you.
3209780	3210780	There's that.
3210780	3212780	But then there's also like they do care for my well-being.
3212780	3215780	They're doctors, you know, they're trying to make me a better me, obviously.
3215780	3218780	But but I don't want to help now.
3218780	3222780	I want to find out who seek is and I want to find out what kind of artists he is.
3222780	3227780	So, you know, I heard you talk to Katie at South by Southwest and she said, oh, I'm trying to figure out what kind of artists I am.
3227780	3228780	I want to paint.
3228780	3229780	I want to draw.
3229780	3230780	I want to create music.
3230780	3231780	And you're like, do them all.
3231780	3232780	So I was like, you know what?
3232780	3233780	I'm going to do them all, too.
3233780	3239780	And so I'm releasing a book called Alain Vitale, which means which is French for vital force.
3239780	3247780	And it's a book about the first robot that gets a soul and in order to prove that he has a soul, he creates a bunch of different art styles.
3247780	3251780	And so I'm creating the art styles as the robot, obviously.
3251780	3253780	And so every page is different art style.
3253780	3255780	So I do purism, surrealism.
3255780	3256780	I do sculpting.
3256780	3258780	You know, I teach.
3258780	3259780	I choreograph a dance.
3259780	3273780	I'm literally doing every art style I can think of and putting it all in one book as a big love letter to art, but also a big love letter to the people that inspired it, which is pretty much everyone that's ever heard or listened to or come to this show.
3273780	3275780	And you guys, obviously.
3275780	3281780	That's amazing.
3282780	3302780	But there's this there's this sobering, chilling edge to the whole thing where you're, you know, you're you're you're gambling like like, you know, your this thing that we all sometimes take for granted, but also are imprisoned by, which is like your well-being.
3302780	3308780	You're you're you're you're you're already you already have to deal with that being at risk all the time.
3308780	3316780	And you've now made this decision that you're these guys that put coils up there and build levies and things and stuff.
3316780	3327780	You know, you're you're you're associating their their tests and treatments and things with a mitigation of of your true self.
3327780	3337780	And so you're just going to like the guy and into the wild kind of like you're you're going to you're going to go off and do the Alaska of not getting these coils anymore.
3337780	3347780	And there could be poison berries or there could be amazing buses that you get to live in that the haven't seen that movie.
3348780	3357780	But but I mean, it's sort of it's the story of a guy who's just kind of like he he he does it wrong, but he gets to live his life.
3357780	3363780	And then he he he he he does die in the end of the wild. Yeah.
3363780	3371780	But but because you're crediting harm in town with the inspiration for this decision, which I don't know if I would ever have the courage to to to make myself.
3372780	3380780	I want to make sure that that that I've had an equal shot at inspiring you to make the other decision, too.
3380780	3387780	You know, have you have you have you do you have a neurologist in your life and you've got these crazy sci-fi scientists in your life?
3387780	3396780	Do you do you have a do you have a counselor of some kind in your life, somebody that you can talk to about this gigantic decision that's maybe a little more qualified than me?
3396780	3406780	Currently, I had right when after I had my first aneurysm rupture, I met with a psychologist and we talked out stuff.
3406780	3410780	And I know you guys were talking about that last week. So it was really cool to have someone to talk to.
3410780	3416780	But I also suffer, like I said, some emotional damage from where the rupture happened.
3416780	3420780	So I'm also like the most robotic person to talk to at times.
3420780	3423780	Like I feel happy and stuff and I get that. And then there are times where I feel sad.
3423780	3426780	But in the middle there, it's like that's where it gets weird.
3426780	3433780	So so that's why I wanted to write a book about a robot because I'm like, I identify you have people up here that identify when they're men.
3433780	3436780	They identify as women and women who identify as men and vice versa.
3436780	3440780	But it's I identify as not human, if that makes any sense.
3440780	3450780	And but I love humanity like I I want to be a part of humanity so much that I'm willing to cut that tether because I think that's what's going to make me rejoin humanity.
3450780	3454780	That's what's going to make me feel the most human before I if I do die. And I don't know.
3454780	3461780	I mean, I've been told twice now that, oh, you got this much time to live. And I'm still here four years later and I feel like I'm doing OK.
3461780	3467780	Like I'm walking. I'm talking pretty good. So I mean, I'm not saying doctors don't know anything.
3467780	3474780	I have utmost respect for doctors are the reason I'm here. But I I think I have to just trust myself for once.
3474780	3477780	And no, I have given it a lot of thought and I've talked about with a lot of friends.
3477780	3482780	But ultimately, it's my decision. And and I'm going to stand by it. I think it's the right one.
3482780	3488780	Absolutely. Of course. And we I when we stand by you, you're our friend.
3488780	3495780	Thank you so much for. So what do you say you don't have like the memories?
3495780	3498780	Is there is it like you do stuff and then sometimes you don't remember you've done it?
3498780	3505780	Sometimes lately it's been happening a lot more. So there's a chance you might not remember Dan's retelling of the duckjack.
3506780	3512780	Can I tell my favorite joke? Yes, of course. Yes. All right. It's real quick.
3512780	3518780	I hate traveling. I think it's because my dad used to beat me with a globe.
3518780	3526780	You see, Dan. Thank you. See.
3526780	3531780	Thanks so much. If I can plug it real quick. Yeah, absolutely.
3531780	3539780	The book I was talking about, Alon Vital, the Kickstarter starts tomorrow and I'm looking to raise five thousand dollars to make a limited 500 print run of it.
3539780	3542780	Cool. So if anyone out there would like to donate, I would appreciate it.
3542780	3549780	Alon, like A-L-A-I-N. E-L-A-N. Alon. Yeah. Cool. All right. Thank you. All right.
3549780	3572780	Holy smoke. That guy asked to actually deal with one of the most offensive things in the world, which is our relationship with an unforgiving, unpredictable God.
3572780	3581780	That's, you know, hashtag cancel humanity. Don't cancel God.
3581780	3591780	That's why your problem with a joke at Colbert. I mean, the ice caps are melting, you dicks.
3591780	3600780	Does anybody else in the room have, I don't know if it's sympathetic or empathetic pain where somebody describes an injury or an illness or whatever that you feel physically the thing?
3600780	3610780	Like I had this thing where he talks about brain injury and my head starts hurting like crazy or someone says they had a friend that had a hernia like operation and my abdomen start hurting.
3610780	3617780	I don't know if anyone else has that. It's like he's up there and my head just starts. I don't get headaches. My head just starts pounding during that.
3617780	3626780	Like I don't know. I don't know if I'm alone. Yeah. Applause. How many people have that? Oh, good. Okay. Yeah.
3626780	3635780	It's like someone like, like, like has a knee injury. It's like, oh, God damn it. Like if your knee starts saying it. Oh, yeah.
3635780	3641780	I can't watch shows where people get hurt, like, like Tash or whatever. And so there's people getting wrecked. Like, I can't.
3642780	3653780	I like the idea of someone who's like that, but it's a terrible knowledge of anatomy. So like the wrong parts of there. My appendix hurts. Oh, my foot.
3653780	3658780	Is that a baton joke?
3658780	3668780	You know it, buddy. You're catching on. But is Duncan back there? Did he ever, did he ever show up? Is he? Almost. Okay.
3668780	3670780	Well, why don't we bring Spencer up?
3682780	3694780	Bounding. I'm just setting up and just hold on. Okay. Spencer, you said a very strange thing in the green room. Suck my dick.
3695780	3704780	I mean, that's not very strange out of place. Sure. You said you, you said you often think about how much you would enjoy fighting a pack of coyote.
3704780	3713780	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. No. I have follow up questions.
3713780	3721780	Also, you live in L.A. You can make this dream come true. Oh, I know. All you have to do is have a cat or a poodle. Yeah.
3722780	3726780	I used to live in Moorpark, which was kind of like a farming town. What?
3726780	3731780	Did somebody just root for Moorpark? Nobody's ever done that.
3731780	3737780	Yeah. No. Seriously. Check it. Look it up on an urban dictionary. It has an entry.
3737780	3747780	But there's a lot of farmland and stuff and you can go out and sometimes we go out hiking just in the fields and stuff at night and you'd be able to hear coyotes or even just not hiking.
3747780	3756780	In my bed, I'd be able to hear coyotes like all the time and you'd hear a lot of them. But like when we go on night hikes, sometimes they sound really close and you'd be like, holy shit.
3756780	3765780	Sounds like six or seven. I'd love to be fine. Now, when you picture yourself fighting a pack of coyotes, is it bare handed or do you have a weapon or some sort of bare handed?
3765780	3771780	I mean, the only thing I can ever imagine is like having a bag with me like a backpack that I'm hiking with because it's hiking.
3772780	3777780	So I'd like, you know, maybe swing hefta bag around. But yeah, mostly bare hands.
3777780	3780780	Do you think you could take a pack of coyotes?
3780780	3783780	I mean, how big are we talking, Kuma? How big of a bag?
3783780	3784780	Six or seven.
3784780	3785780	Yeah, yeah, definitely.
3785780	3791780	I kind of feel like they're very cowardly scavengers. I mean, they're...
3791780	3796780	Oh, I'm talking about enraged, like pissed off coyotes.
3796780	3799780	I don't know what's supposed to happen here.
3799780	3805780	Traveling down the roads of Moorpark, you stop when you hear a rustling.
3805780	3812780	The red gleaming eyes from the bushes are all the information you need to realize what's upon you.
3813780	3816780	A pack of slightly timid coyote.
3819780	3822780	So you have initiative.
3824780	3826780	You can take six or seven coyotes.
3826780	3830780	I can say this just by looking at you. You're never flat-footed against coyote.
3830780	3834780	Yeah, no, that's definitely a bonus I earned.
3834780	3840780	I think he could do it, but not because of the six coyote, actually. Is it the plural coyote?
3840780	3841780	I don't care.
3841780	3842780	Coyotes.
3842780	3843780	I think it's coyotes.
3843780	3844780	Coyotes.
3845780	3847780	Coyotes interrupt us.
3847780	3848780	Coyote tie.
3849780	3850780	Coyotes.
3850780	3851780	Coyotes.
3851780	3852780	What do you say?
3852780	3853780	You're somebody's Sam?
3853780	3854780	Coyotes.
3854780	3865780	I think that if all six of them had a rage virus or whatever that made them physically endeavor as a unit of six coyote, I think my dog could take me out.
3867780	3868780	I could take your dog.
3868780	3869780	No way, man.
3871780	3875780	The thing about dogs is all it takes is one blow to the throat.
3876780	3884780	I mean, sure, you got to throw out your left arm, not your good arm, your left arm as a sacrifice.
3884780	3888780	But once it's clamped on, it's just a quick knee in the throat and you're done.
3888780	3895780	Wait, but Rottweilers and those guys kill people all the time?
3895780	3901780	Yeah, I hear a lot about people getting attacked, and you literally never hear them going for the throat, ever.
3902780	3909780	Well, because the stories aren't going to be like, the guy went for the throat and it didn't work, because he didn't let me tell the tale, Spencer.
3909780	3916780	You hear about the flailing they do and that they hit it on the top of the head or they try and un-wedge the jaw.
3916780	3917780	That's not what you do.
3917780	3918780	You just go for the throat.
3918780	3920780	If they can't breathe, they're not going to be biting you.
3920780	3923780	Where did you read this?
3923780	3925780	Where is this information?
3925780	3926780	This is holistic knowledge.
3926780	3927780	I've cleaned and I have a day life.
3927780	3929780	What journal do you subscribe to?
3929780	3932780	Yeah, it's a dog throat attack monthly.
3932780	3937780	Harvard Medical Coyote edition.
3937780	3938780	I'm just saying.
3938780	3941780	I mean, have you guys seen coyotes?
3941780	3942780	Yeah, I grew up in...
3942780	3944780	They're like maybe twice the size of a house cat.
3944780	3945780	They're not huge.
3945780	3948780	They're mangy looking skinny things.
3948780	3951780	I've never seen them in really what I call packs.
3951780	3955780	I've seen them travel around which look like small nuclear families.
3955780	3958780	Like you see like mom and pop and maybe a kid.
3958780	3959780	Yeah, that's probably more likely.
3959780	3962780	And also, they're terrified of us.
3962780	3965780	But I mean, again, we're talking about that's out of the equation here.
3965780	3967780	So you're saying these are special coyotes?
3967780	3971780	I mean, they're just not going to be super timid.
3971780	3972780	That's what I'm saying.
3972780	3973780	He just wants to fight them.
3973780	3975780	So if they're timid, they're going to run away.
3975780	3976780	Yeah, that's not a fight.
3976780	3978780	But you wouldn't want to fight a wolf because a wolf will kick you.
3978780	3979780	No, no, sure.
3979780	3982780	I mean, I might be able to take one wolf.
3982780	3984780	Maybe.
3984780	3987780	Now, I say there's only one way to find out.
3988780	3989780	I don't think.
3989780	3992780	Let's bring out our wolf.
3992780	3996780	Spencer, we have great news.
3996780	3999780	Spencer, do you think you could take a pitbull or a Rottweiler?
3999780	4003780	I don't because I mean, honestly, if you're talking like a coyote versus a pitbull.
4003780	4006780	Well, I mean, that's a crazy huge difference.
4006780	4007780	That's what I'm saying.
4007780	4012780	It's like there's a lot of dogs that I'd feel more confident fighting against.
4012780	4015780	Rottweilers and pitbulls probably aren't up there.
4015780	4018780	What about 80 Shih Tzu?
4018780	4020780	Yeah, see, this is the whole thing.
4020780	4023780	When they're small enough, and I think you could pull this off with a coyote,
4023780	4026780	all you have to do is spin around kicking.
4026780	4028780	That's not easy to do.
4028780	4030780	It's very easy to do.
4030780	4031780	This is a street fighter.
4031780	4033780	It's not down back kick.
4033780	4036780	It is quite literally down back kick.
4036780	4037780	Spencer.
4037780	4039780	You just spin down and backwards while kicking.
4039780	4040780	How?
4040780	4042780	I mean, show us, please.
4045780	4049780	If somebody just instagrammed this right now, I'm going to kill all of us.
4049780	4052780	It is such a bummer that this is an audio podcast.
4052780	4053780	God damn it.
4053780	4056780	Because that is one of the best things I've ever seen.
4056780	4060780	Spencer did something between Jean-Claude Van Damme and Baryshnikov.
4060780	4062780	Pippi Longstacking.
4062780	4065780	I don't see any of those kicks doing major damage.
4065780	4067780	No, but you keep knocking them back.
4067780	4069780	You just got to keep going.
4069780	4071780	You know, they would get you on the ground.
4071780	4073780	I mean, not Shih Tzus.
4073780	4075780	Oh, no, not Shih Tzus.
4075780	4078780	Honestly, you might have been born in the wrong era.
4078780	4082780	There's a great book about the early New York Five Points.
4082780	4085780	They made that terrible movie, Gangs of New York, about it.
4085780	4088780	Luke Santé wrote a book called Low Life.
4088780	4091780	Someone likes that movie?
4091780	4094780	You're the person that wounded it at Moorpark?
4094780	4096780	That movie stinks.
4096780	4098780	It's a bad history.
4098780	4101780	Maybe it's a fine movie, but it's not good history.
4101780	4106780	There was a bunch of things, like entertainment back in the good old bad days of America.
4106780	4109780	There were things like rat baiting and bear baiting.
4109780	4113780	There was a thing called rat stomping, where they would put a guy in a ring,
4113780	4119780	surrounded by a wooden pen, and they would put like a hundred or two hundred rats in there.
4119780	4123780	And you had to stomp them because they would come attack you.
4123780	4125780	No, no, no, but is it like a sport?
4125780	4128780	You would bet rat or man.
4128780	4131780	So these weren't prisoners.
4131780	4133780	No, no, this is a bar.
4133780	4140780	This is a bar, which is now the Bowery, in the Lower East Side of New York.
4140780	4144780	There'd be bear baiting, and there'd be dogs versus bears,
4144780	4148780	and you would bet money on dogs, four dogs or bear.
4148780	4150780	I wouldn't want to watch that.
4150780	4151780	It's all horrible.
4151780	4155780	I think that, Spencer, you might have taken to that rat stomping.
4155780	4157780	You were talking about rat stomping.
4157780	4159780	You know those tiny monkeys that you see at the zoo?
4159780	4161780	The little tiny black ones?
4161780	4163780	Like really inches tall?
4163780	4164780	Yeah, those are adorable.
4164780	4166780	The first time I saw those, I was just like,
4166780	4168780	man, don't you just want to squish one?
4168780	4170780	Oh, see now.
4170780	4172780	Just stomp on it.
4172780	4175780	Spencer's learning to fly.
4175780	4179780	We're getting to the heart of the matter here.
4179780	4183780	So in your coyote fight fetish dreams,
4184780	4186780	are you annihilating them?
4186780	4189780	Are you breaking their necks and ripping their hearts out?
4189780	4190780	No, no.
4190780	4192780	Well, you break a couple necks, sure.
4192780	4195780	You've got to fight it back without breaking a couple necks.
4195780	4197780	I imagine you want to make a coyote omelet.
4197780	4199780	Well, I mean, you've got to take it out of the fight, right?
4199780	4200780	Yeah.
4200780	4201780	It's important.
4201780	4203780	I think fighting a bunch of coyote,
4203780	4205780	I think the first thing you do is you break the biggest one's neck
4205780	4207780	and send a message to the rest of you.
4207780	4209780	Well, yeah, again, this isn't assuming
4209780	4211780	they're not just going to turn tail and run, obviously.
4211780	4212780	So that's the thing.
4212780	4213780	If you were to spin around circles,
4213780	4215780	you'd kick about half the coyotes.
4215780	4216780	They'd freak out and leave.
4216780	4217780	Okay, how about you, Spencer?
4217780	4218780	I will say this.
4218780	4222780	That move you did is a lot less threatening than you think it is.
4222780	4224780	It's not supposed to be threatening.
4224780	4228780	It's specifically designed to take on hordes of small dogs.
4228780	4235780	If I see a little dog and I see a guy doing that, I'm like, I got this.
4235780	4236780	There's no way.
4237780	4241780	Dogs, like any dog bigger than a Shih Tzu or any canine,
4241780	4245780	their objective is to get you down on the ground.
4245780	4250780	And once that happens, you're in trouble.
4250780	4252780	Well, again, with coyotes, they're very light.
4252780	4256780	So if you have three or four coyotes on you, you just jump right up.
4256780	4260780	But you can't jump up when these things got you.
4260780	4261780	Yeah, buddy.
4261780	4265780	My dog loves me and sometimes he gets me at a disadvantage.
4265780	4266780	What does that mean?
4266780	4267780	What?
4267780	4268780	That just sounds dangerous.
4268780	4275780	Well, I'm just saying he's a golden doodle, but he's like a five foot child.
4275780	4281780	He would have the body mass of like six, five coyotes.
4281780	4285780	They have mouths full of little 32 caliber bullets.
4285780	4286780	Coyotes do?
4286780	4289780	That's why you throw it in the left arm.
4289780	4292780	They could kill you, man.
4292780	4294780	Sometimes I lay in bed with this guy and I'm rubbing his belly
4294780	4297780	and he's just like, oh, and I look at his teeth and I'm like, yeah,
4297780	4299780	this fucker could kill me.
4299780	4300780	That's what Kooto is.
4300780	4301780	Kooto goes bad.
4301780	4304780	I have a scar on my ass, so my left butt cheek,
4304780	4306780	like a shark tooth, like a triangle.
4306780	4309780	That's your butthole.
4309780	4311780	Is there poop coming out of it?
4311780	4312780	Is it right in the middle?
4312780	4314780	Yeah.
4314780	4316780	When you push the button and pull the chain,
4316780	4319780	is that where the Choco Choo Choo train comes up?
4319780	4322780	Because that's a butthole.
4323780	4325780	Everyone has that scar.
4325780	4326780	It's not a scar.
4326780	4327780	Don't think of it that way.
4327780	4328780	That's fucked up.
4328780	4331780	Listen, it's not pretty, but that doesn't mean it's a scar.
4331780	4332780	It's not a wound.
4332780	4334780	It's actually, if anything, it's keeping you alive.
4334780	4337780	I feel like you guys are making a little too lightly
4337780	4340780	of an actual injury that I had.
4340780	4342780	My neighbors, when I was a kid,
4342780	4344780	we had the O'Sullivan to live next door,
4344780	4349780	and there was 19 of them because they were Irish Catholic and...
4350780	4353780	No, there were fucking 19 of some of them.
4353780	4355780	Any time, Bill, Jeff, my brother and I,
4355780	4357780	any time you guys want to come up
4357780	4359780	and take a swim in our pools, we didn't have a pool,
4359780	4361780	any time you guys want to walk up and have a swim,
4361780	4364780	just make sure that their dog,
4364780	4366780	the two German Shepherds, one was named Guinness.
4366780	4368780	I remember his name because I bear the scar on my face.
4368780	4369780	I feel like you have, like,
4369780	4372780	you've put racist memories in your childhood.
4372780	4376780	The Irish people's dog was named Guinness?
4376780	4378780	This is an actual fact.
4378780	4380780	My brother has a dog named...
4380780	4382780	We had a dog named Guinness because of that, too.
4382780	4384780	The others was Shalalie.
4384780	4386780	Shalalie?
4386780	4388780	Yeah, one was just called Drinkin'
4390780	4392780	and a parakeet named Famine.
4394780	4395780	Pote.
4395780	4396780	Too soon.
4398780	4400780	I mean, not funny enough?
4400780	4403780	I hope you're groaning and that was a bad joke.
4403780	4405780	I went too far.
4405780	4407780	I can't stop...
4407780	4410780	Think about him thinking that it's somebody thinking
4410780	4412780	they're an old little scar
4412780	4414780	and it's still making me laugh.
4414780	4415780	I know.
4415780	4417780	I felt like he shut that down too fast.
4417780	4418780	Yeah, I thought so.
4418780	4420780	You and I were having a good time
4420780	4422780	just placating him about his scar.
4422780	4425780	Hey, mom, I have bad news. I have a scar.
4425780	4428780	And it bleeds, but it's not blood.
4428780	4431780	Yes, my scar bleeds long brown blood.
4433780	4435780	You don't know how to make this joke funny.
4436780	4438780	I'm trying to help your awesome premise, you guys.
4438780	4439780	We're doing it.
4439780	4443780	You're literally shitting over our awesome joke.
4443780	4445780	So do your scar-y butt hole.
4445780	4447780	Sometimes men come over to my apartment
4447780	4449780	and fuck me in my scar.
4450780	4451780	You're not good at it.
4451780	4452780	What?
4452780	4453780	You can't make this look...
4453780	4454780	Okay, go ahead.
4454780	4455780	It's my scar.
4455780	4457780	That's maybe why you can't make it funny.
4457780	4458780	I don't know.
4459780	4462780	I'm just trying to help you with your bulletproof premise.
4463780	4465780	Long brown blood.
4466780	4469780	You've shown us that our premise maybe isn't so bulletproof.
4471780	4472780	Okay, go ahead.
4472780	4474780	So you're there with the dogs.
4474780	4475780	The guys said the dogs would be locked up.
4475780	4476780	We got up there.
4476780	4477780	The dogs were not locked up.
4477780	4479780	And there were two giant German shepherds.
4479780	4482780	And Guinness, of all people, comes running straight at me.
4482780	4485780	And I had like a little bathing suit on,
4485780	4488780	and I'm like...
4489780	4490780	I'm defenseless.
4490780	4491780	I'm barefoot.
4491780	4494780	I'm sorry, long brown blood just got funny to me.
4495780	4496780	It's so gross.
4496780	4497780	Now?
4497780	4498780	Yeah, I don't know why.
4498780	4500780	It's like a really, like a wrestler
4500780	4503780	for a really, really low caliber wrestling federation.
4504780	4506780	There goes long brown blood.
4508780	4510780	He's going up against scorpion scissors.
4510780	4513780	Oh, long brown blood.
4515780	4516780	Long brown blood.
4517780	4518780	Go ahead.
4519780	4521780	So the dog's running at me and my brother,
4521780	4523780	but the dog picks me the smaller the two.
4523780	4525780	I think that's good pack animal instincts,
4525780	4527780	as if they take the baby out.
4527780	4528780	I don't know.
4528780	4529780	I was about like six or something like that.
4529780	4531780	And I turned around, thank heavens,
4531780	4534780	because he chomped me right where the essentials might have been.
4534780	4536780	And he took a piece out of my ass
4536780	4538780	and took a big chomp.
4538780	4539780	That's the other thing.
4539780	4540780	They go for your nuts.
4540780	4541780	That's what I was going to say.
4541780	4542780	Okay.
4542780	4543780	They go for your crotch.
4543780	4545780	Because that's dog height.
4545780	4547780	And it doesn't matter how much throat punching you do.
4547780	4549780	Well, no, you kick them right when they're in mid jump.
4549780	4551780	They can't change direction.
4551780	4552780	Dude, there's more than one.
4552780	4553780	There's a lot of them.
4553780	4554780	Yeah.
4554780	4555780	Well, they don't all jump at the same time.
4555780	4556780	That'd be silly.
4558780	4559780	Right.
4559780	4561780	Because they don't want to get hurricane away by your kicks.
4561780	4562780	Yeah.
4563780	4564780	I'm trained under chomp.
4564780	4568780	You're a flurry of feet that you have unleashed
4568780	4569780	on this unsuspecting pack.
4569780	4571780	You saw that flurry of feet.
4572780	4573780	Please.
4573780	4574780	I know you don't like doing requests,
4574780	4576780	but I'm the only one that's going to have a video of this.
4576780	4578780	Can you get up and demonstrate the...
4578780	4580780	I really don't like doing requests.
4580780	4581780	Come on.
4581780	4585780	I'll do my Sean Connery impression if you do your circle kick.
4585780	4586780	Show us the magic.
4586780	4588780	We have to have it documented.
4588780	4589780	No.
4589780	4590780	For science more than anything.
4590780	4591780	I'm going to cry while I do it, though.
4591780	4592780	Okay.
4592780	4593780	Fine.
4593780	4594780	All right.
4594780	4595780	Do it.
4595780	4596780	Whoo!
4596780	4616780	That's how you fight off a pack of dogs.
4616780	4617780	I sold out.
4617780	4618780	By the way, how...
4618780	4620780	This is the day that the podcast changed me.
4620780	4621780	I sold out.
4621780	4624780	How pissed would you be if that was the ending to the gray?
4624780	4625780	That's what he did.
4625780	4626780	Oh, that should be it.
4626780	4627780	That'd be amazing.
4627780	4628780	That would have been amazing.
4628780	4630780	Just leave him pieces.
4630780	4634780	That's basically how Alice in Wonderland ended, right?
4634780	4638780	That's why they cut the ending out of the gray.
4638780	4641780	He kept teasing that crazy movie that he's got.
4641780	4642780	And then he's like, does it?
4642780	4646780	Spencer, it doesn't matter how many of them come at you.
4646780	4649780	I've got a special move I'll use.
4649780	4651780	What's it called?
4651780	4656780	The Mega Neeson.
4656780	4659780	The Whirling Liam.
4659780	4662780	And they're like, can you show us the Whirling Liam?
4662780	4663780	No.
4663780	4665780	Dogs have to come at me in a certain...
4665780	4669780	I have to be encircled and they have to come at me one by one.
4669780	4671780	I'm perfectly counter-clockwise.
4671780	4672780	Oops.
4672780	4674780	I spilled water everywhere.
4674780	4677780	That was so intimidating.
4677780	4678780	And thrown.
4678780	4680780	Spencer, I think I speak for all of us when I say we've missed you dearly, man.
4681780	4684780	Is... no?
4684780	4689780	Duncan Trussell was threatening to drop in on us, but it's also 9.30.
4689780	4691780	This show doesn't need him.
4691780	4692780	No, I know, but...
4692780	4694780	I have tears running down my face.
4694780	4697780	I cannot handle it.
4697780	4699780	Have you done that before?
4699780	4703780	Was there a time when you were in your room and you were like, if dogs happen, I think I can do this.
4703780	4704780	Yeah, are you kidding?
4704780	4707780	Why do you think I had such confidence when I told you that?
4707780	4710780	You don't just go into these situations half-cocked.
4710780	4711780	Do you prepare?
4711780	4716780	I also think if you're spinning around in a circle, you're gonna start, like, you know, getting...
4716780	4718780	Oh, yeah, that's why, you know, six or seven.
4718780	4721780	No, but you said 80... whatever.
4721780	4722780	Cheetos.
4722780	4723780	What?
4723780	4724780	Cheetos.
4724780	4725780	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4725780	4728780	You'd start... but again, at some point, you'd start stomping.
4728780	4730780	It'd be... you'd save energy.
4730780	4732780	It's self-defence.
4732780	4734780	It's self-defence.
4734780	4735780	You'd save energy.
4735780	4738780	It's self-defence.
4738780	4740780	These are bloodthirsty sheep shoes.
4740780	4742780	Yeah, so I could commit violence against animals.
4742780	4743780	What's wrong with that?
4743780	4745780	It's hypothetical.
4745780	4749780	Yeah, if it helps, these dogs are all racist, so...
4749780	4750780	And Polish.
4750780	4753780	And Polish pitons.
4753780	4756780	Piton coyotes.
4756780	4757780	You know what?
4757780	4762780	You know, a piton coyote went into a bar.
4763780	4769780	And he's like, like, this is how a piton coyote eats a shih tzu.
4774780	4779780	I held the shih tzu with my paws, put it over to the side.
4779780	4781780	It's better they don't know.
4784780	4789780	Deconstructing the piton joke formula.
4789780	4793780	It seems like they just have bad spatial...
4793780	4795780	No depth perception.
4795780	4798780	That is a big component of the piton joke.
4798780	4801780	A lot of them suffer from an agenesis of the basal colosome
4801780	4805780	or the compass colosome, and they don't know where things are.
4805780	4806780	Yeah.
4806780	4807780	Fucking pitons.
4807780	4810780	Can you do the joke that's Sikh dead?
4810780	4812780	Which is one line?
4812780	4814780	Oh, well, my dad...
4814780	4815780	Oh, God.
4815780	4817780	Oh, God.
4817780	4818780	Oh, dear God.
4819780	4822780	My dad was a globe manufacturer.
4826780	4828780	Oh, oh, God damn it.
4828780	4829780	Quick disclaimer.
4829780	4831780	Some kid wrote to me on Tumblr.
4831780	4833780	I think it was Tumblr.
4833780	4834780	I want to pull it up.
4834780	4839780	Last week's episode, you know, I was in my cups, as Chevy calls it.
4839780	4841780	I was having fun.
4841780	4844780	When I'm talking about therapy and stuff and how much I don't want to do it
4844780	4847780	and blah, blah, blah, and I'm all self-righteous and indignant and all that stuff,
4848780	4850780	I'm not in role model mode.
4852780	4860780	And I never want anybody emulating me or taking anything I say seriously in that regard.
4861780	4864780	We apparently talked Sikh out of actual help.
4864780	4865780	Well, yeah.
4865780	4867780	I mean, he was inspired by your show.
4867780	4869780	I'm like, well, don't say that.
4871780	4872780	God damn it.
4872780	4873780	Where's the...
4873780	4876780	I thought it was one of our Tumblr dealies.
4876780	4877780	Whatever.
4877780	4878780	It doesn't matter.
4878780	4882780	I guess I wanted to give the person, you know, give them their own words,
4882780	4886780	but I don't think I can find them, so whatever.
4886780	4892780	It was a kid writing in and saying, you know, I hope that...
4892780	4896780	You know, because they said, I need help from professionals
4896780	4901780	and I hope that nobody interpreted your screed as like being a recommendation
4901780	4905780	against seeking help from others, professional people and stuff like that.
4905780	4911780	Not only was I being ironic, like I, in the end, like I'm self-deprecating going,
4911780	4913780	of course the whole point of this is that I'm crazy.
4913780	4914780	I'm in denial.
4914780	4918780	Nobody needs therapy more than me and I like to have fun and say,
4918780	4921780	I don't need therapy and therapists are full of bullshit.
4921780	4923780	I mean, I'm not kidding either.
4923780	4928780	I'm expressing this indignation and like crazy.
4928780	4929780	I'm being a child.
4929780	4935780	I'm sucking my thumb and like having fun, but I don't want any of you kids out there.
4935780	4939780	I don't want anybody that thinks that they need to talk to somebody
4939780	4943780	to think that they shouldn't, my God, or that that's a bad choice.
4943780	4944780	That's crazy.
4944780	4945780	That's so crazy.
4945780	4949780	You should see a shrink.
4949780	4954780	Going to a shrink is not going to hurt you at all and could very well help you
4954780	4959780	and I'm only making fun of myself by saying indignantly that I don't need to go
4959780	4961780	and I'm 41 and blah, blah, blah.
4961780	4967780	So I hope that that buys back any karma that I may have tainted.
4967780	4970780	All right, back to being funny.
4970780	4973780	Also, races are good.
4973780	4978780	If I said anything and it made you think your race is bad.
4978780	4979780	It's good.
4979780	4981780	It's a good way to know who to trust.
4981780	4985780	I think, you know, look, we all have our functions.
4985780	4991780	You know, Germans are, they're like the Swiss army knife of races.
4991780	4994780	What are the Swiss?
4994780	5001780	Sort of a, I call them the German shadow.
5001780	5003780	What are the Dutch?
5003780	5010780	The Dutch are, they're the Dykes of men.
5010780	5012780	He's tough but fair.
5012780	5013780	He's tough but fair.
5013780	5022780	The blue people are, they're black.
5022780	5024780	El Salvadorans?
5024780	5028780	They love carrots.
5028780	5032780	But what are Peruvians famously afraid of?
5032780	5034780	Mosquitoes.
5034780	5039780	But it's that fear that drives them, you know, it keeps them making bug zappers.
5039780	5046780	That's technically racist to say that Peruvians make great bug zappers but they do.
5046780	5048780	El Salvadorans, what did you say?
5048780	5049780	El Salvadorans.
5049780	5052780	They're terrified of mosquitoes.
5052780	5057780	I said it.
5057780	5061780	You go down there, you do mission work like I did.
5061780	5062780	I help those people.
5062780	5063780	I work with them.
5063780	5068780	I understand them and when you work with them, you learn to laugh at them.
5068780	5072780	It becomes okay.
5072780	5081780	I have carried an El Salvador child into the ocean to drown him, to show him mosquitoes.
5081780	5083780	Ocean mosquitoes?
5083780	5089780	Because that country has no extradition policy.
5089780	5092780	Oh my God.
5092780	5095780	There's been such great advice on this.
5095780	5098780	Oh no, it's Words to Live By, it should be the title of the podcast.
5098780	5099780	It should be Words to Live By.
5099780	5100780	Oh.
5100780	5101780	Or Long Brown.
5101780	5102780	Scarfoo.
5102780	5103780	No, I just mean it should be.
5103780	5104780	Long Brown.
5104780	5109780	It should be called, do as I say and as I do.
5109780	5112780	We've learned how to fight dogs.
5112780	5113780	Imitate me.
5113780	5121780	And the logo is just a fork going into an outlet.
5121780	5131780	Just a happy kid staring into a happy son.
5131780	5135780	Spencer, is this a thing that you've thought about since you were a kid fighting?
5135780	5136780	I really want to parse this.
5136780	5140780	Yeah, like I said, I grew up listening to coyotes like outside my window.
5140780	5146780	And it's like, man, is there going to be a time where they're going to be closer than outside my window?
5146780	5147780	I don't know.
5147780	5149780	Yeah, I definitely thought about it.
5149780	5151780	I used to hike a shit ton.
5151780	5153780	Again, we lived in farmlands.
5153780	5154780	And you'd just go.
5154780	5157780	If you got a one mile anywhere, you'd be hiking.
5157780	5159780	You wouldn't just be walking on a street.
5159780	5160780	Think about stuff.
5160780	5163780	I used to fall asleep when I was a little kid in Teston.
5163780	5165780	Behind the house was just hills.
5165780	5166780	There was nothing there.
5166780	5167780	Now it's totally developed.
5167780	5169780	But it was just at night.
5169780	5171780	It was so cool.
5171780	5172780	Yeah, it's great.
5172780	5174780	Yeah, we heard one last year.
5174780	5176780	We live in Silver Lake.
5176780	5178780	And we actually went out, too.
5178780	5180780	Because Emily is like, loves animals.
5180780	5181780	And she was like, there's a dog.
5181780	5182780	It's lost.
5182780	5183780	We've got to go find this.
5183780	5184780	And we went.
5184780	5186780	And it was just a coyote out there.
5186780	5189780	I wish I'd known about this spin kick move.
5189780	5190780	What about that?
5190780	5195780	Is it like a big ass mountain lion or a jaguar or some shit that lives up in the Hollywood Hills?
5195780	5196780	Have you seen this shit?
5196780	5198780	Oh, there's cougars there.
5198780	5200780	Yeah.
5200780	5201780	I'm so sorry.
5201780	5202780	Go ahead.
5202780	5203780	Please take that out.
5203780	5205780	Test it.
5205780	5206780	Leave it.
5206780	5210780	And somebody put a motion sensor camera up, but aimed it towards the Hollywood side.
5210780	5213780	And there's an awesome glamour shot of this giant mountain lion.
5213780	5214780	Is it a mountain lion?
5214780	5216780	It's fucking enormous.
5216780	5218780	It's a huge predator.
5218780	5222780	They just crossed the 134 freeway somehow?
5222780	5223780	I don't know how you get there.
5223780	5224780	Yeah.
5224780	5231780	I remember when we were kids, one of our vacations was we went to a different part of Pakistan
5231780	5232780	to go hiking.
5232780	5235780	And we all day took us to get up this mountain.
5235780	5237780	Me and my family and their friends.
5237780	5239780	Is it Patanville?
5239780	5240780	No.
5240780	5241780	It's not.
5241780	5242780	Yeah.
5242780	5245780	We climbed the mountain by digging a hole.
5245780	5247780	Spatial gyms.
5247780	5248780	Yeah.
5248780	5250780	They can't do a damn thing the right way.
5250780	5252780	And we finally got all the way up.
5252780	5256780	What is a patan sandwich?
5256780	5260780	It's just two pieces of meat with a bread in between.
5261780	5263780	That is what it is.
5263780	5268780	We've really figured this out.
5268780	5272780	I saw they wear glasses on their feet and shoes on their head.
5272780	5276780	They just have airplanes for hats.
5276780	5279780	We climbed all the way up, took us all day.
5279780	5282780	And as soon as we got up there, it was like a very barren mountain.
5282780	5285780	And we got there and it was just one tree.
5285780	5290780	And under that tree was just sitting a big fucking lion looking right at us.
5290780	5295780	And we all walked up, saw this lion, and just hiked back down.
5295780	5298780	Our whole day was going to be hanging out on top of that mountain.
5298780	5300780	We just saw this fucking...
5300780	5301780	On Lion Ridge?
5301780	5302780	Yeah.
5302780	5303780	Just this mountain's taken.
5303780	5304780	Yeah.
5304780	5306780	So what do you think, tough guy?
5306780	5308780	You get a little adventure.
5308780	5312780	Well, is there anything else we need to wrap up before we go on a month-long break?
5312780	5314780	I don't actually hate animals.
5314780	5315780	This is hypothetical.
5315780	5316780	No, no, no.
5316780	5317780	We're not...
5317780	5318780	None of us think you're actually going to fight.
5318780	5321780	Everyone was disclaiming, I feel like I should have done it too.
5321780	5322780	No, don't let me jump start that.
5322780	5324780	Look, I think it's one thing that's for certain.
5324780	5327780	There's nothing that you can say on this stage that's so innocuous that someone's not going
5327780	5328780	to have a problem with it.
5328780	5329780	No, that's true.
5329780	5330780	I want to make that...
5330780	5332780	Now I want to make that clear.
5332780	5333780	That's a good example.
5333780	5335780	That backpedal, whatever you call that.
5335780	5340780	I was saying that because I love people and I want them to be happy and I don't want them
5340780	5341780	to be in pain.
5341780	5345780	Then there's this other culture of like, wow, that was offensive technically.
5345780	5350780	You put your elbow on the table of language and it's like, I shouldn't have done that
5350780	5352780	because I know that that hurt someone.
5352780	5354780	I'm saying that's not...
5354780	5358780	It's like we blur the two and go like, you should apologize.
5358780	5362780	I thought Natasha Leggero's a non-apology for her...
5362780	5363780	That was great, huh?
5363780	5364780	Oh, so good.
5364780	5367780	Her Pearl Harbor joke.
5368780	5370780	I thought that was amazing.
5370780	5371780	Perfectly.
5371780	5375780	That reigned in a new era for me of like, what the fuck are we doing?
5375780	5376780	I miss that.
5376780	5380780	She just made some joke on a New Year's Eve show about like, it was just like...
5380780	5382780	Didn't we talk about this already?
5382780	5387780	It was like a really innocuous joke mainly about like, Pearl Harbor veterans being older
5387780	5388780	something.
5388780	5390780	It was a very innocuous joke.
5390780	5391780	I don't know.
5391780	5395780	SpaghettiOs was sponsoring the show and she said that's good because it's the only food
5395780	5396780	that the Pearl Harbor veterans...
5396780	5397780	I had no idea.
5397780	5399780	But only because they're old.
5399780	5402780	Redoing someone's joke is not going to make it sound funny and blah, blah, blah.
5402780	5403780	It doesn't matter.
5403780	5404780	No, we've proven that.
5407780	5413780	But her non-apology like, blog was great because it was like, hello.
5413780	5418780	So anyways, I guess I'm supposed to apologize but I'm not going to because I don't really
5418780	5422780	believe that the world's greatest generation wasn't in any way threatened by my dumb joke
5422780	5423780	about SpaghettiOs.
5423780	5425780	I really refuse to believe it.
5425780	5428780	I don't think Pearl Harbor got them down.
5428780	5433780	If they survived Pearl Harbor, they could make it through my joke.
5433780	5435780	I think we apologize too much.
5435780	5436780	And you know why?
5436780	5439780	Because the D&D Day stands for day.
5439780	5441780	I was wondering what D Day stands for.
5441780	5442780	It's Day Day.
5442780	5444780	It's the stupidest shit in the world.
5444780	5447780	D Day stands for Day Day.
5447780	5449780	I was like, what is D Day?
5449780	5450780	What is the D&D Day?
5450780	5451780	It's Day.
5451780	5452780	Day Day.
5452780	5454780	Like ATM machine?
5454780	5455780	Yeah.
5455780	5456780	Salsa sauce.
5456780	5457780	Yeah.
5457780	5458780	Or Sierra Mountains.
5458780	5459780	Ah.
5459780	5460780	Right.
5460780	5461780	Or Glendale.
5461780	5463780	Glendale, which means Valley Valley.
5463780	5465780	Tautology, I think they call it.
5465780	5466780	No?
5466780	5467780	Is that right?
5467780	5468780	I don't know.
5468780	5469780	Alright, fuck it.
5469780	5470780	Fuck it.
5470780	5471780	Day Day.
5471780	5472780	Fuck your language.
5472780	5476780	Fuck you Pearl Harbor assholes.
5476780	5480780	I'm sorry.
5480780	5483780	Spencer, can we just...
5484780	5487780	While you unpack your gear...
5487780	5491780	Are we continuing the thing we were doing?
5491780	5493780	I hope so, yeah.
5493780	5495780	Did you hear errands and dragons?
5495780	5496780	Yeah, it was amazing.
5496780	5497780	I wish that she was here.
5497780	5499780	I'd like her to DM me instead.
5499780	5501780	So much less work.
5501780	5502780	No, I'm kidding.
5502780	5503780	I love it.
5503780	5504780	But yeah, no, she was great.
5504780	5505780	It was great.
5505780	5507780	I really liked listening to it.
5507780	5511780	She was thinking of starting a podcast where she does a terrible job of dungeon mastering
5511780	5512780	some kind of game.
5512780	5517780	I think I was too much of an asshole about warning her that it's like, you know, there's
5517780	5518780	some rules to the game.
5518780	5520780	Like, you should read some of the books.
5520780	5522780	Like, it's not just improv.
5522780	5523780	Well, that's the thing.
5523780	5526780	Like, if I was just making stuff up, this would be so much easier.
5526780	5527780	Yeah.
5527780	5529780	But, you know, it's a lot harder when you have to abide by rules and stuff.
5529780	5530780	No offense to Erin.
5530780	5532780	Like, I'm not saying she had any faults.
5532780	5533780	She didn't do anything wrong.
5533780	5535780	She was great, but...
5535780	5536780	I just want to disclaim.
5536780	5538780	I mean, no, she was great because she did everything wrong.
5538780	5539780	That's why it was great.
5539780	5542780	Like, she willfully neglects the rules.
5542780	5545780	I was in a blackout.
5545780	5546780	I don't remember.
5546780	5547780	Yeah, what happened?
5547780	5550780	Oh, you were doing the charity that day, and you were tight as Dick's hatband.
5550780	5551780	Yeah.
5551780	5553780	I don't know.
5553780	5554780	What is that?
5554780	5556780	A Dick's hatband?
5556780	5557780	You never heard that?
5557780	5558780	It's an old expression.
5558780	5559780	That's weird, isn't it?
5559780	5560780	I said yeah to it.
5560780	5561780	I was like, yeah.
5561780	5563780	Yeah, that old chestnut.
5563780	5565780	Tight as a Dick's hatband.
5565780	5567780	Tight as Dick's hatband.
5567780	5568780	That means you're drunk.
5568780	5569780	What?
5569780	5570780	Look it up.
5570780	5571780	I don't know.
5571780	5572780	Dick, like, Private Eye probably.
5572780	5575780	It's one of those idioms that nobody knows exactly why it is.
5575780	5577780	Private Eye's wear tight hats.
5577780	5581780	It's one of those idioms that I just made up 30 seconds ago.
5581780	5584780	The other night, I heard I was pissed as a parrot.
5584780	5585780	I think it was great.
5585780	5587780	I don't know that parrots got drunk, but I like them.
5587780	5589780	You know those wild parrots at Burbank?
5589780	5590780	Yeah.
5590780	5591780	Isn't that crazy?
5591780	5592780	Yeah.
5592780	5593780	Right outside, like, the building.
5593780	5595780	I came out, and I saw them, and I was like, what the...
5595780	5596780	What is going on?
5596780	5599780	Spencer, how would you fend yourself...
5599780	5601780	How would you fend off physically?
5601780	5604780	Well, of course you clip their wings, and then you do the spin kick.
5604780	5605780	No, it's spin punches.
5605780	5607780	They're coming from the air.
5607780	5608780	Spin punches?
5608780	5609780	Spin punches.
5609780	5610780	They're coming from the air.
5610780	5611780	Spin punches.
5611780	5612780	I don't suppose we can see the spin punches.
5612780	5613780	I can't kick that high.
5613780	5615780	It looks the same, but I'm punching.
5615780	5616780	Yeah.
5616780	5617780	Imagine...
5617780	5618780	It's so amazing.
5618780	5623780	Imagine a flock of parrots attacking Spencer, and he's just going in a circle, punching
5623780	5625780	left, punching right, punching left.
5625780	5630780	What if parrots and coyotes teamed up and came at you at once?
5630780	5636780	I mean, it's tough because the whole spin kick thing is you're punching behind you.
5636780	5637780	Oh, no.
5637780	5638780	I didn't catch that.
5638780	5639780	Well, it's not...
5639780	5642780	Oh, so you had a rear guard punch going on?
5642780	5643780	Well, it's not a guard.
5643780	5645780	It's more of a decoy that also flails.
5645780	5647780	You might smack something.
5647780	5648780	I didn't even notice that.
5648780	5649780	I didn't notice that.
5649780	5650780	I didn't know how new I was.
5650780	5651780	This is well thought out.
5651780	5654780	This is not just bullshit.
5654780	5656780	You're like a magician, man.
5656780	5659780	You're distracting us with the...
5659780	5660780	Yeah.
5660780	5663780	If they jump at my back, they'll just get my arms.
5663780	5665780	I could swing them around for a knee.
5665780	5666780	All right, Spencer.
5666780	5670780	Let's rejoin our campaign in Dungeons and Dragons territory.
5670780	5671780	Oh, yeah.
5671780	5673780	He's got his hands behind him.
5673780	5674780	Yeah.
5674780	5679780	It's better than getting your kidneys spin.
5679780	5684780	Last time on Harmontown, our heroes with the help of a minotaur named Meredith
5684780	5688780	and her crazy ladder had managed to climb out of their hole
5688780	5691780	and back into the frozen wastelands of the north.
5691780	5693780	They sought the tarragon of virtue,
5693780	5696780	nestled upon the floating isle of paradise,
5696780	5699780	which was elusive as it was utopian.
5699780	5703780	Mulrain jumped onto Coco and began scouting out the nearby landscape
5703780	5704780	in all directions.
5704780	5707780	In the vast, featureless tundra,
5707780	5710780	the ranger discovered a sack covered in gnomish script
5710780	5712780	and brought it back to the group.
5712780	5714780	While the gang puzzled and debated over the sack,
5714780	5717780	Mulrain took initiative and leapt into the sack
5717780	5720780	and into an equally magical city.
5720780	5724780	The gang followed suit and soon they were met with a gnome named Fizzbulb.
5724780	5728780	Christopher quickly solved the gnome's riddle,
5728780	5731780	granting them access to the magical city.
5731780	5735780	But before the gang could enjoy Bill Mardigan's delights,
5735780	5737780	they were stricken by agonizing pain,
5737780	5740780	a symptom of their bloody soul curses,
5740780	5743780	promises to slay Meredith, their newfound ally.
5743780	5746780	But could the gang break their curses
5746780	5749780	or would they be forced to slay Meredith?
5749780	5751780	And who was Bill Mardigan?
5751780	5754780	And did he have anything to say about this?
5754780	5759780	We'll find out tonight on an all-new Harmontown Time.
5766780	5768780	Yay.
5768780	5774780	Alright, so we're all feeling the agony of the soul curse in our heads right now.
5774780	5778780	Yeah, you guys are still reeling from the massive pain you just experienced.
5778780	5783780	It was in your head and then you felt a burning in your soul and it was like, ah.
5783780	5785780	Is the gnome still with us?
5785780	5786780	Fizzbulb.
5786780	5788780	Yeah, Fizzbulb, he's sitting on a toadstool.
5788780	5790780	He just gave you the riddle and you solved it.
5790780	5791780	He's sitting.
5791780	5793780	Let's go to Bill Mardigan's, right?
5793780	5795780	Yeah, we gotta get there.
5795780	5796780	Alright.
5796780	5799780	They have buffalo wings there that'll wipe you out.
5799780	5801780	I want hot legs.
5801780	5803780	A gnome appears in front of you.
5803780	5804780	I mean, he doesn't appear.
5804780	5809780	He leaps out of a bucket that he was in and he introduces himself.
5809780	5814780	He says, my name is Fizzbulb and I'm supposed to help you get around the city.
5814780	5816780	How y'all doing today?
5816780	5818780	He comes out of a bucket?
5818780	5820780	Out of a bucket.
5823780	5827780	I want to get high right now.
5827780	5832780	Welcome to Bill Mardigan's, the city that's everywhere.
5832780	5834780	Wait, you know where Mard...
5834780	5835780	Wait.
5835780	5837780	I'm Wizzbulb.
5837780	5839780	Do you work at Bill Mardigan's?
5839780	5840780	I mean, I don't...
5840780	5842780	I have a job here.
5842780	5843780	Mostly I'm just...
5843780	5844780	In the bucket?
5844780	5845780	No.
5845780	5846780	Sharpie.
5846780	5849780	Bill Mardigan's is the city that's everywhere.
5849780	5850780	Okay.
5850780	5851780	Wizzbulb.
5851780	5852780	Yeah.
5852780	5853780	We're cursed.
5853780	5858780	We're cursed with a pain that...
5858780	5862780	We were supposed to kill this minotaur Meredith over here and we didn't because we're good people.
5862780	5868780	And now we're being punished for this deal that we made that we would die if we didn't destroy this person.
5868780	5871780	I'm behind on my mortgage.
5871780	5872780	Okay, well we...
5872780	5873780	You live in a fucking bucket.
5873780	5874780	It's not a competition.
5874780	5876780	Oh, I thought we were just revealing personal truths.
5876780	5879780	No, no.
5879780	5882780	How much is the mortgage on your bucket?
5882780	5883780	No, that's not my house.
5883780	5885780	It's a portal.
5885780	5886780	That's a portal?
5886780	5887780	Yeah.
5887780	5888780	I stick my head in his bucket.
5888780	5891780	You pop your head out of a bucket in a bathroom.
5891780	5894780	It's a small bathroom.
5894780	5898780	No, that's just where I keep the bucket.
5898780	5900780	Wait, do you poop in the bucket?
5900780	5901780	No.
5901780	5904780	I use it for travel.
5904780	5907780	It'd be great to poop in the bucket and just send it to another dimension.
5907780	5909780	But then it'd come out right before you.
5909780	5912780	I pull my head out of the bucket and I look at Whizball.
5912780	5913780	You do that.
5913780	5915780	You live in a bathroom?
5915780	5921780	I have a bathroom in my house where I keep a bucket.
5921780	5925780	Do you poop in that bucket?
5925780	5932780	I feel like my life is so much weirder than I've always thought.
5932780	5938780	I poke my head in the bucket and I look around for a confirmation that this is not the actual toilet.
5938780	5940780	There's a toilet and there's a sink.
5940780	5941780	It's like a porcelain toilet.
5941780	5943780	You don't even understand.
5943780	5945780	I pop my head back out.
5945780	5949780	So you just keep the portal to this other dimension in your bathroom at your other crib?
5949780	5950780	Yeah.
5950780	5952780	Why do you keep it in the bathroom?
5952780	5956780	Because then if I have to get out of the house...
5956780	5961780	Is that why they call you Whizball?
5961780	5965780	No, but that's very clever.
5965780	5966780	Well, it's not on me.
5966780	5970780	I mean, it seems like that's something that might have occurred to you before.
5970780	5974780	No, I never thought my bucket would be questioned to be quite honest.
5974780	5982780	Whizball, is there anybody in Bill Mardigan's Great Expanse that could help us lift this curse from us?
5982780	5984780	Bill Mardigan's a place of wonder.
5984780	5990780	We got potion peddlers, vape shops, barn grills, Spizwad's weird bungalow, and of course a cigarette museum.
5990780	5994780	I go to Spizwad's weird bungalow.
5994780	5997780	I make a beeline for Spizwad.
5997780	6001780	I'll cover the cigarette museum.
6001780	6004780	I'm going to go with that bucket.
6004780	6011780	Okay, so Christoper emerges from the bucket in a gnomish bathroom while Quark heads over to...
6011780	6013780	How big is the bucket?
6013780	6015780	It's a magic bucket.
6015780	6016780	You can fit through it?
6017780	6020780	It's like Santa's chimney.
6020780	6022780	It's like that bag that you guys came through.
6022780	6023780	Yeah, okay.
6023780	6024780	All right, sorry.
6024780	6027780	It's cool, I'm just throwing things out there.
6027780	6033780	I pee in his toilet, but I don't flush because you know what they say?
6033780	6037780	If it's yellow, if it's brown, let it drown.
6037780	6038780	I don't know how it goes.
6038780	6039780	Let it drown?
6039780	6040780	Flush it down.
6040780	6044780	If it's brown, let it drown.
6045780	6048780	That's what my mother said to me when I was born.
6048780	6049780	That's not true.
6054780	6057780	They were really hoping for a miracle.
6058780	6062780	I jump back out and I go, are we all going to different things?
6062780	6068780	I'm going to Spizwad's weird bungalow.
6068780	6070780	I want to go to the weird bungalow too.
6070780	6072780	I was going to do the cigarette museum.
6073780	6074780	I'm taking Meredith with me.
6074780	6077780	There's a sign that says closed for renovations.
6078780	6080780	That's why I wanted to knock that one out first.
6081780	6085780	I pitch up to Spizwad's weird bungalow.
6085780	6088780	You come up to a shoddily constructed room.
6088780	6090780	It's a one-room flat.
6090780	6095780	It's got a very little, it's got a big table with chains on either end
6095780	6098780	that's just kind of dominating the center of the room.
6098780	6103780	And on that table sitting on it like it were a chair or something sittable,
6103780	6108780	I guess it is sittable, is a gnome who you take to be Spizwad,
6108780	6112780	especially because he has a name tag that says it's such.
6112780	6117780	He's got a big blue and orange beard, which is weird even for gnomes.
6117780	6119780	And he's sitting there.
6119780	6122780	He's like, hey, what's up?
6123780	6126780	I heard about your bungalow.
6128780	6132780	And look, my name is Cork.
6132780	6135780	I'm new here at Bill Martigans.
6135780	6139780	And what's for sale here at the bungalow?
6139780	6142780	I'm a curse breaker and a healer.
6142780	6143780	Son of a bitch.
6143780	6144780	Oh, shit.
6144780	6146780	Extraordinaire.
6146780	6147780	Nailed it.
6147780	6149780	I look out the bungalow.
6149780	6151780	Guys, I found the guy.
6151780	6157780	I look over where I'm studying the really complex cigarette museum hours.
6158780	6162780	I'm trying to figure out Mondays and Tuesdays except Wednesdays.
6163780	6164780	What?
6164780	6166780	I got a curse breaker in here.
6166780	6167780	Oh, shit.
6167780	6168780	Yeah.
6169780	6172780	Wait, I go in there too.
6172780	6176780	So what seems to be the problem?
6176780	6181780	We have a sole curse on us because we made a deal to kill off this minotaur here, Meredith.
6181780	6184780	And we didn't want to because we took mercy.
6184780	6185780	Yeah, we befriended her.
6185780	6187780	And we feel like we're being punished unjustly.
6187780	6190780	She's a stand-up minotaur with a weird ladder.
6190780	6194780	He waves his arms and pokes his eyes with his hands.
6194780	6197780	And you see his eyes kind of change color magically.
6197780	6199780	And he's like, true vision.
6199780	6204780	And he looks at you guys and is like, hmm, hmm, hmm.
6205780	6207780	It's just like detective mode in the back.
6207780	6209780	That's stuck in there pretty good.
6209780	6211780	Yeah, it is kind of like that.
6211780	6212780	Kind of.
6212780	6213780	I never played that game, probably.
6213780	6214780	Biz what?
6214780	6216780	Is there any way to get these curses unbroken or broken?
6216780	6218780	They're in there pretty tight.
6218780	6220780	It's going to cost a pretty penny.
6220780	6222780	Do you guys have any material wealth?
6222780	6223780	Hell yeah.
6223780	6224780	Hell yeah.
6224780	6225780	Do you?
6225780	6226780	I don't know.
6226780	6228780	Actually, I don't see anything in my money.
6228780	6231780	You don't loot corpses after you kill them?
6231780	6232780	Oh, fuck.
6233780	6235780	Holy shit.
6235780	6236780	Biz what?
6236780	6238780	Full disclosure, we've killed a lot of people.
6238780	6240780	That never occurred to us.
6240780	6242780	We're fucking broke right now.
6242780	6244780	We've killed a lot of people.
6244780	6245780	Yeah.
6245780	6247780	I'm poor as Job's turkey over here.
6247780	6250780	I killed a million, a million people.
6250780	6252780	We're doing the batons looting.
6252780	6254780	Yeah.
6254780	6256780	Which is we give them money.
6256780	6257780	Yeah.
6257780	6259780	We leave money in the corpses.
6259780	6260780	Yeah.
6260780	6263780	A baton thief.
6263780	6267780	Dollar signs appear in the corpse's eyes.
6271780	6272780	Wrong eyes.
6272780	6277780	I have a loot of charming I'd be willing to part with.
6277780	6280780	I can't play the loot.
6280780	6281780	That's pretty cool though.
6281780	6282780	Yeah.
6282780	6285780	I could use 70 cartons of cigarettes.
6285780	6287780	Oh shit.
6288780	6290780	Do you know how to sell cigarettes at the cigarette museum?
6290780	6293780	Because usually at museums they don't sell the stuff that they...
6293780	6295780	Guys, I don't know what you're talking about.
6295780	6297780	Okay, private pow wow.
6297780	6299780	Yeah.
6299780	6303780	First of all, let's remember to loot corpses from now on.
6303780	6305780	Yeah.
6305780	6307780	That was a mistake.
6307780	6309780	We could have retired by now.
6309780	6312780	Yeah, because we're definitely going to leave some more corpses in our wake.
6312780	6313780	Yeah, certainly.
6313780	6316780	But we should have found some treasure now and then.
6316780	6318780	Not without looking for it.
6318780	6320780	Hey buddy.
6320780	6322780	What part of private pow wow?
6322780	6324780	What part of private bow do you not understand?
6324780	6326780	I can hear everything.
6326780	6328780	It's a small puddle of...
6328780	6329780	Okay.
6329780	6330780	I'll leave.
6330780	6331780	No, no, stay here.
6331780	6332780	No, no, stay.
6332780	6333780	That's why I'd stay.
6333780	6334780	Who gives a shit?
6334780	6336780	Guys, Dan...
6336780	6337780	Sorry, Sharpie.
6337780	6338780	Did you see...
6338780	6340780	You went over to the cigarette museum.
6340780	6341780	Was it open?
6341780	6342780	It's closed for real.
6342780	6343780	Let's break into that thing.
6343780	6345780	Steal this guy his cigarettes and we'll pay the dude off.
6345780	6348780	Renovation being the key point.
6348780	6354780	You'll be expecting men in white overalls to be going in and out of there.
6354780	6355780	Okay.
6355780	6357780	Spizwad, is there a...
6357780	6363780	How about maybe we see if there's a store that sells cigarettes before we...
6363780	6366780	We're not going to be able to loot any corpses if we buy honest cigarettes.
6366780	6367780	We don't need to loot.
6367780	6369780	I mean, we could just trade maybe.
6369780	6372780	Like, I could give up my goggles of night.
6372780	6373780	Spizwad.
6373780	6374780	Spizwad.
6374780	6377780	Does anybody sell carton cigarettes in Bill Martigan's?
6377780	6378780	Oh, probably.
6378780	6380780	This place is full of cigarettes.
6380780	6382780	I don't know about 70 cartons though.
6382780	6383780	It takes a long time to make...
6383780	6385780	Okay, guys, let's just go rob the goddamn place.
6385780	6387780	Wait, you guys make cigarettes here?
6387780	6389780	If we need to, we can jump in the bucket or back out the back.
6389780	6391780	Listen, they make cigarettes.
6391780	6393780	That's what Bill Martigan's does.
6393780	6395780	Well, yeah, it's a main export.
6395780	6400780	It's the city of smoking and riddles.
6400780	6401780	Guys, I'm a gnome.
6401780	6403780	We love smoking and riddles.
6403780	6408780	But it seems fucked up to rob a museum in the same town where you're buying curse breaks.
6408780	6409780	Spizwad.
6409780	6411780	How bad do you want these cigarettes?
6411780	6413780	I mean, how bad do you not want to die?
6413780	6416780	You okay?
6416780	6418780	He makes a good point, fellas.
6418780	6420780	70 cartons.
6420780	6422780	So your export is cigarettes.
6422780	6425780	You guys are basically like North Carolina.
6425780	6426780	What?
6426780	6431780	All right, fair enough.
6431780	6432780	Fair enough.
6432780	6435780	Guys, look, my head is killing me.
6435780	6438780	I don't know about you guys, but the soul curse has really taken its toll.
6438780	6440780	Let's not beat around the bush.
6440780	6442780	It's a closed museum.
6442780	6445780	You know, we're seasoned veterans of lots of battles.
6445780	6449780	Let's just go in there, get these cigarettes, pay the gun.
6449780	6451780	We'll get the soul curse lifted.
6451780	6454780	We'll jump back through the sack and be back in our way.
6454780	6458780	All right, but I feel morally conflicted about it, so we have to really keep it secret.
6458780	6459780	That seems weird.
6459780	6462780	We've committed so many weirder crimes.
6462780	6465780	We've killed our friends.
6465780	6468780	You've killed our friends.
6468780	6472780	I would like you to think back on all of my behavior throughout this campaign
6472780	6473780	and realize that I...
6473780	6474780	Irrational.
6474780	6475780	Irrational.
6475780	6479780	Torrid asshole monsters that try to leverage us.
6479780	6481780	No, authority issues.
6481780	6486780	Yeah, so that's not the same as robbing a gnome museum.
6486780	6488780	A cigarette museum?
6488780	6489780	Well, they do.
6489780	6491780	They aren't bad for you.
6491780	6494780	Yeah, we're getting rid of a cigarette museum.
6494780	6496780	It's not good for the kids.
6496780	6501780	But you think a museum is going to have 70 cartons of cigarettes?
6501780	6503780	What's this museum about?
6503780	6505780	Are there lots of cigarettes in there?
6505780	6506780	I reckon.
6506780	6507780	Why do you ask?
6507780	6508780	You've never been?
6508780	6510780	Just because we really want to see what's...
6510780	6512780	We're just big fans.
6512780	6514780	You know, it's closed for renovations.
6514780	6518780	Is there a cigarette factory around?
6518780	6522780	You know, there really ought to be.
6522780	6526780	I can't think of one, but you can't imagine.
6526780	6528780	You're the city that has everything.
6528780	6530780	No, there's everyone.
6530780	6532780	I admit that.
6532780	6533780	You'd imagine that.
6533780	6536780	Guys, I think I see which side the bread is buttered on.
6536780	6538780	Let's just go to the museum.
6538780	6539780	I got a...
6539780	6541780	Can I get a sub powwow?
6541780	6542780	Okay.
6543780	6545780	Spizwad, cover your ears.
6545780	6546780	I'll leave.
6546780	6547780	Okay.
6547780	6548780	Okay.
6548780	6549780	Spizwad leaves.
6549780	6551780	I got the old teleport cape.
6551780	6552780	You know what I'm saying?
6552780	6556780	It's like, this is going to be a breeze.
6556780	6560780	Let's go find a spot in the alley and teleport to inside the...
6560780	6561780	Did we all go in there?
6561780	6563780	Oh, open the back door.
6563780	6564780	We could also...
6564780	6565780	Yeah.
6565780	6566780	That's great.
6566780	6567780	How about this?
6567780	6568780	You don't even need to open the back door.
6568780	6571780	If we get that guy's bucket, we could...
6571780	6574780	We teleport in with the bucket and then we can climb through the bucket into the...
6574780	6577780	The bucket just leads to the guy's bathroom.
6577780	6579780	But if we move it from the guy's bathroom...
6579780	6583780	Although, I don't know how you could carry the bucket through itself.
6583780	6590780	If I can teleport with the bucket into the museum and then I can take a shit in that guy's bathroom from the museum...
6590780	6593780	I don't know if it's going to help us.
6593780	6596780	I say it's worth a try.
6596780	6598780	It's better to have the perfect crime.
6598780	6601780	It's better to have it not want than not having it.
6601780	6604780	I like the idea of bringing in a museum just to take a shit in their toilet.
6604780	6606780	A different guy's toilet.
6606780	6607780	A different guy's...
6607780	6608780	Guys...
6608780	6609780	Okay.
6609780	6610780	I like that idea.
6610780	6611780	I'm also...
6611780	6612780	I'm going to keep talking like this.
6612780	6616780	All right, all right, all right.
6616780	6617780	I got...
6617780	6619780	We have a bag of holding or something, right?
6619780	6621780	I could just pop in there and fucking...
6621780	6623780	I'll do this Hudson Hawk style.
6623780	6625780	We could go to one of the other spots that's cool.
6625780	6626780	Yeah, we'll make a diversion.
6626780	6628780	You go in there and do it and we'll just...
6628780	6630780	We'll, you know...
6630780	6634780	Yeah, we'll create a diversion that'll draw attention away from the cigarette museum.
6634780	6635780	Okay, cool.
6635780	6636780	Okay.
6636780	6638780	Give me a bag of holding.
6638780	6639780	I got one.
6639780	6640780	Okay.
6640780	6641780	Okay, great.
6641780	6642780	All right.
6642780	6643780	All right.
6643780	6644780	Hey, Spizwad.
6644780	6645780	Hey.
6645780	6646780	We're going to get you 70 cards.
6646780	6647780	I'm back.
6647780	6648780	Okay.
6648780	6649780	Are there any brands you prefer?
6649780	6652780	Yeah.
6652780	6653780	Yeah.
6653780	6657780	Give me some Gnarlborough Pinks.
6657780	6658780	What is this, the Flintstones?
6658780	6660780	That was way too...
6660780	6663780	That got way too good of a reaction.
6663780	6666780	Gnarlborough.
6666780	6669780	They play a terrible mad magazine.
6669780	6674780	Spizwad, is there a famous commercial for Gnarlborough Pinks?
6674780	6676780	There would be, probably.
6676780	6678780	You'd think so, right?
6678780	6679780	Yeah.
6679780	6683780	You know, they have the famous Gnarlborough man who's the...
6683780	6684780	It's the Gnarlborough...
6684780	6685780	No.
6685780	6687780	Gnarlborough, no.
6687780	6688780	All right.
6688780	6691780	I think we figured out the best version of that joke.
6691780	6694780	Let's move on.
6694780	6695780	All right, come on.
6695780	6696780	I don't want to cliffhank before this heist.
6696780	6697780	All right, no, no, no.
6697780	6698780	Let's go.
6698780	6699780	So you do that.
6699780	6700780	We're going to create a distraction.
6700780	6701780	Okay.
6701780	6703780	We'll go outside, and if we see...
6703780	6706780	We'll be lookouts, and if we see any fuzz or anybody that wants to come up,
6706780	6708780	and any 5-0 shows up, we'll...
6708780	6712780	We should have some sort of signal that we can signal you if you're in there like,
6712780	6714780	hey, there's 5-0.
6714780	6715780	Right.
6715780	6716780	What's the signal?
6716780	6717780	Don't we have...
6717780	6720780	Oh, I'll play my looted charming.
6720780	6724780	I could sing Lady in Red.
6724780	6725780	Okay.
6725780	6729780	If there's trouble, we'll start singing Lady in Red really loud.
6729780	6730780	Yeah.
6730780	6731780	Okay.
6731780	6732780	Okay.
6732780	6733780	All right.
6733780	6735780	So we walk over to the cigarette museum.
6735780	6736780	Great song.
6736780	6737780	You do that.
6737780	6738780	You're there.
6738780	6739780	All right.
6739780	6741780	It doesn't seem like there's any guards around.
6741780	6742780	Okay, cool.
6742780	6748780	I go to a discreet spot where I'm out of the view of the public, and I use the teleport
6748780	6752780	cape to teleport myself through the wall of the museum.
6752780	6754780	You teleport into the museum.
6754780	6760780	You see several things are covered up and papered over for the renovation, but you see...
6761780	6765780	The biggest thing you see dominating the room next to posters of cigarettes and all sorts
6765780	6772780	of breakdowns of models of cigarettes and diagrams, you see a giant bust of a gnome composed
6772780	6774780	entirely of cigarette butts.
6774780	6782780	Its eyes smolder with smoke, and it seems to look at you as you enter.
6782780	6787780	Bro, I think you just got fucked.
6787780	6792780	I disguise myself.
6792780	6797780	As you're casting the words, you notice it definitely is looking at you.
6797780	6803780	It turns towards you, a massive amalgamation of cigarettes, and opens its mouth and says,
6803780	6806780	I am Bill Mardigan.
6806780	6810780	What do you in my museum?
6810780	6826780	Lady in red, messing with me cheek to cheek.
6826780	6832780	Well, I am sharpie butts a lot.
6832780	6836780	Which is sort of a good descriptor for what this person is.
6836780	6838780	A lot of butts.
6839780	6841780	He's a lot of butts.
6841780	6848780	I am a human sorcerer who has seen many adventures, and I am in your town because I am afflicted
6848780	6855780	by an unfair curse that wants me to kill a friend, which I cannot.
6855780	6867780	Because in my world, friendship and cigarettes are the foundation of life.
6867780	6879780	And I came in here to find cigarettes that I could use to pay to have my curse lifted.
6879780	6882780	And those cards are on the table.
6882780	6886780	I'm not a good liar.
6886780	6889780	I don't think I could beat you in a fight.
6889780	6892780	You're made of cigarettes.
6892780	6898780	Even if I could, even if I could, I wouldn't want to.
6898780	6901780	Because even if he did, he wouldn't loot you.
6901780	6904780	To battle looting, pull out my pockets.
6904780	6907780	I've never looted a single corpse in my life.
6907780	6911780	That should tell you something.
6911780	6914780	That's no excuse for trespassing.
6914780	6917780	Even if you like friendship and cigarettes.
6917780	6921780	Two most important things to me.
6921780	6925780	Sounds like there's some common ground.
6925780	6927780	You're absolutely right.
6927780	6929780	And I didn't think that I was...
6929780	6931780	I wasn't thinking of it as trespassing.
6931780	6933780	I was thinking of it as...
6933780	6936780	I saw the sign that said, you're under renovation.
6936780	6939780	Yeah, it's a dangerous place. You might get hurt.
6939780	6940780	Yeah, and I actually...
6940780	6943780	I've done a lot of carpentry and things.
6943780	6948780	So I misinterpreted it with my tiny non-cigarette brain
6948780	6952780	as meaning that you needed help renovating in here.
6952780	6954780	And it was going to come in and help
6954780	6957780	so I could come in and see the cigarettes sooner.
6957780	6959780	I fucked up.
6959780	6960780	I'm admitting that.
6960780	6965780	So you are lying.
6965780	6967780	We're outside. We're outside.
6967780	6971780	Never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight.
6971780	6974780	His eyes seem to glow brighter
6974780	6977780	as if someone's taken a drag from his eyes.
6977780	6979780	And then he opens his mouth
6979780	6981780	and smoke billows out into the room.
6981780	6984780	It swirls around you and consumes you
6984780	6986780	and choking acrid smog.
6986780	6988780	It's hard to breathe, but it doesn't feel too bad.
6988780	6992780	It feels smooth and flavorful.
6992780	6999780	You have entered null world country.
6999780	7002780	Can I get a warning label about this
7002780	7005780	or explaining what it is?
7005780	7008780	No!
7008780	7011780	Well, are we fighting?
7011780	7015780	Just wait.
7015780	7017780	What are we doing outside?
7017780	7019780	You guys are looking for guards, right?
7019780	7020780	We think we're kicking ass.
7020780	7022780	There's not very many guards.
7022780	7024780	I look at Christopher and say,
7024780	7025780	this has taken too long.
7025780	7026780	No, I don't know.
7026780	7028780	You think something's bad?
7028780	7029780	It's 70 cartons.
7029780	7031780	I think it's going to take him a while.
7031780	7033780	Trust me, I think things are fine.
7033780	7039780	Okay.
7039780	7042780	I'm wearing my boots of spry-springing.
7042780	7045780	Does that mean I could like leap out of the smoke?
7045780	7046780	You can, yeah.
7046780	7048780	Sure.
7048780	7050780	I say to the guy,
7050780	7053780	hey, listen, I'm wearing these boots of spry-springing
7053780	7057780	and I might leap out of the smoke
7057780	7058780	but just really still,
7058780	7060780	why don't I have an open dialogue with you
7060780	7065780	and I don't want to lose your trust
7065780	7070780	and create a cycle of mistrust by avoiding this smoke
7070780	7075780	but at the same time you're not explaining the smoke.
7075780	7079780	And I asked you, are you attacking me?
7079780	7081780	You said just wait.
7081780	7084780	I could take that two ways.
7084780	7085780	Okay.
7085780	7086780	Can we go outside?
7086780	7087780	Hey, I think something is wrong.
7087780	7088780	Yeah.
7088780	7090780	There's a chance that he's probably getting angry.
7090780	7091780	You know what?
7091780	7093780	I say we go in there and help right now.
7093780	7094780	Let's just burst our way in.
7094780	7095780	This has taken too long.
7095780	7098780	I'm going to go grab that pee bucket, that portal,
7098780	7099780	just in case.
7099780	7100780	Go to the guy's bathroom.
7100780	7101780	Yeah.
7101780	7102780	That's a good getaway place.
7102780	7103780	Yeah.
7103780	7104780	Just in case.
7104780	7105780	It's better to have.
7105780	7107780	I go grab the pee portal bucket
7107780	7111780	and I just burst with all my mite through the front door.
7111780	7114780	You burst with all your mite through the front door
7114780	7119780	and into the area where Sharpie managed to pull himself into.
7119780	7121780	You see him, he's surrounded by smoke,
7121780	7123780	but then he leaps out of it, right?
7123780	7124780	Well, I know.
7124780	7125780	I started talking to the guy.
7125780	7128780	Then he starts, then he's saying all these weird things.
7128780	7129780	You don't get what's going on.
7129780	7130780	It's very confusing.
7130780	7132780	There's a man made of cigarettes.
7132780	7134780	I don't think that, you know, now is the time
7134780	7136780	to enter into conflict.
7136780	7137780	While he's talking, I take the buckets
7137780	7139780	and I just, I see the cigarette monster, right?
7139780	7140780	I see what's going on here.
7140780	7141780	Yeah.
7141780	7142780	Okay.
7142780	7144780	No, don't attack the cigarette monster.
7144780	7147780	I just, I look, I go instinctively.
7147780	7148780	I think what we could do.
7148780	7149780	Christopher?
7149780	7150780	I think we could wave the bucket around
7150780	7155780	and move all the smoke to that guy's bathroom.
7155780	7157780	I was just going to push him into the bucket
7157780	7159780	and send him to the fucking bathroom.
7159780	7160780	I feel like.
7160780	7163780	He doesn't want to go to the bathroom.
7163780	7165780	Yeah, what if he doesn't want to go to the bathroom?
7165780	7167780	Well, he'll be in the bucket.
7167780	7169780	I think we could talk to him.
7169780	7171780	I think we could talk to this guy.
7171780	7172780	All right.
7172780	7174780	Let's not fight.
7174780	7177780	Okay, this guy.
7177780	7180780	Smoke pours through the guy's mouth
7180780	7183780	and is now kind of consuming this whole room and smoke.
7183780	7187780	You guys are overcome with smooth flavor.
7187780	7190780	Hey, sense motive on him, maybe?
7190780	7191780	No.
7191780	7192780	Yeah.
7192780	7193780	No.
7193780	7194780	Hold on.
7194780	7196780	He's trying to get you flavor.
7197780	7200780	You think that he's...
7200780	7202780	He doesn't seem hostile,
7202780	7205780	but he does seem overwhelmingly powerful.
7205780	7206780	All right.
7206780	7208780	I don't think a bucket is going to defeat this guy.
7208780	7210780	I light a torch and I throw it at him to try to...
7210780	7211780	No!
7211780	7212780	No, please.
7212780	7214780	I intercept the torch.
7214780	7215780	Okay.
7215780	7216780	All right.
7216780	7217780	I didn't throw it.
7217780	7218780	I had to cocks.
7218780	7219780	Okay.
7219780	7220780	And I go,
7220780	7221780	Quark!
7221780	7222780	What?
7222780	7223780	Please.
7223780	7224780	Let's talk to this guy.
7224780	7225780	Is he attacking...
7225780	7226780	Hey.
7226780	7227780	Who are you asking?
7227780	7229780	Cigarette buddy.
7229780	7232780	I am Bill Mardigan.
7232780	7234780	Oh, it's Bill Mardigan.
7234780	7235780	Holy shit.
7235780	7238780	Dude, your name is everywhere.
7238780	7241780	I am everywhere.
7241780	7243780	Are you attacking our friend or are things cool?
7243780	7244780	No.
7244780	7247780	He is a true follower of the curling smoke.
7247780	7250780	He enjoys both cigarettes and friendship.
7250780	7251780	Oh.
7251780	7252780	Oh, this is good.
7252780	7253780	You almost set this guy...
7254780	7256780	That's funny.
7256780	7257780	You should say that.
7257780	7259780	That's very funny because I just lit this torch.
7259780	7261780	I like smooth flavor.
7261780	7263780	I smoke torches.
7263780	7266780	This is like a big, really hardcore cigarette.
7266780	7267780	Great.
7267780	7268780	All right.
7268780	7269780	Okay.
7269780	7271780	I love cigarettes also.
7271780	7276780	Then breathe in the purifying smoke of Narlboro.
7276780	7277780	It's all right.
7277780	7278780	It's all right.
7278780	7280780	You sense motive on him.
7280780	7281780	Yeah.
7281780	7283780	I mean, he's just welcoming us to Narlboro country.
7283780	7285780	We're going to get killed by this guy.
7285780	7286780	No.
7286780	7287780	No.
7287780	7288780	He's a good guy.
7288780	7289780	You don't know.
7289780	7290780	We've been here for three seconds.
7290780	7291780	It seems like he's...
7291780	7292780	Okay.
7292780	7293780	Again.
7293780	7295780	You're going to regret me and that light and this fucker on fire, man.
7295780	7296780	This has happened a lot.
7296780	7299780	We've run into people who are our friends, and we end up fighting them, and they're very
7299780	7300780	powerful.
7300780	7301780	He's a cigarette monster.
7301780	7305780	I mean, I wouldn't put it past him to suppress research about long-term effects of what's
7305780	7306780	happening here.
7306780	7309780	But at the same time, in the short term, I think he just wants us to be happy.
7309780	7310780	Yeah.
7310780	7311780	All right.
7311780	7312780	Look.
7312780	7313780	10-10, cliffhanger.
7313780	7317500	I deeply inhale the smoke, and I say, fuck it.
7317500	7319780	You feel your curse being lifted.
7319780	7320780	Oh.
7320780	7321780	Oh.
7321780	7322780	Oh, my guys.
7322780	7323780	You guys.
7323780	7324780	You guys.
7324780	7327180	You guys got to try this.
7327180	7328980	I also deeply inhale.
7328980	7330340	I hadn't inhaled yet.
7330340	7331340	I don't.
7331340	7333220	You seem to be kind of resisting.
7333220	7334220	Oh, sorry.
7334220	7335220	I was just...
7335220	7336220	I was talking.
7336220	7337220	I assumed I was breathing the whole time.
7337220	7338220	I don't know.
7339220	7342540	The same happens to you.
7342540	7344980	Christoperger's still possessed in general, though.
7344980	7345980	Oh, fuck.
7345980	7346980	Right.
7346980	7347980	No.
7347980	7348980	Okay.
7348980	7349980	Fuck the cigarette monster.
7349980	7351620	No, no, no, no, no, no.
7351620	7352620	Fuck you, buddy.
7352620	7353620	No.
7353620	7354620	We can go back.
7354620	7355620	We can go back to Spizwad.
7355620	7356620	Maybe get your curse lifted.
7356620	7357620	We can bring him some cigarettes.
7357620	7358620	I don't have a curse.
7358620	7359620	I'm doing great.
7359620	7360620	Cheers.
7360620	7361620	All right.
7361620	7363820	But our curses are lifted, you guys.
7363820	7367300	I mean, I mean, at least that soul curse, for the time being, we're good.
7367300	7369820	Meredith bursts in, carrying a long ladder.
7369820	7370820	Uh-oh.
7370820	7371820	No.
7371820	7372820	Hey, what's up?
7372820	7373820	Uh, we're good.
7373820	7375500	We don't have to kill you now.
7375500	7379300	I'll put this away, then.
7379300	7380300	She leaves.
7380300	7381300	Cliffhanger!
7381300	7382300	All right, gang.
7382300	7383300	Yeah.
7383300	7393940	If you're crazy, go get professional help.
7393940	7397520	If you're a race, love yourself and each other.
7397520	7404700	If you're a comedy writer, embrace the challenge of writing non-offensive comedy.
7404700	7412460	If you love Harman Town, we'll see you in May.
7412460	7413460	Thank you, Dustin Marshall.
7413460	7414460	Thank you, Meltdown.
7414460	7415460	Nerd.
7415460	7416460	Melt.
7416460	7420220	I thank you most of all to the people that come here every week.
7420220	7421220	You guys are the best.
7421220	7422220	We love you.
7422220	7423220	We'll see you soon.
7424220	7427220	We send you free on Sundays to watch Game of Thrones in peace.
7427220	7428220	Oh, yeah.
