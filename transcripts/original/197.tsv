0	15380	Oh, yeah, it's a little music by our friend Titanic Sinclair from Hollywood, California,
15380	25400	the Sunshine State, Hermitown is once again in session, let's bring out Spencer Crittenden
25400	49440	right off the bat. And the mayor of Hermitown, Ted Harmon. Thank you. Thank you. It's very
49440	52960	kind. Very kind people. Thank you very much. All right. We've got a lot of talks about.
52960	63720	Oh, shit. All right. What should we talk about? It's part of a time strip. I got high. All right.
63720	73400	I went out of the way. Yeah, what do we talk about first? You guys, if you want,
73400	77920	you can all come back in like 10 minutes. I'm trying to look through and like,
77920	87960	what will I be mad if Rob interrupts before I bring out Rob? Let's bring out Rob Shrub, everybody.
107920	121880	He might have got bigger applause than the mayor. It's all ironic. Everybody loves Loki
121880	129560	more than Thor, but they know I'll take that. I'll take that. I will take that. I'll take that
129560	140280	comparison. Brought to you by Dr. Pepper. God damn it. This is what you get when you don't talk
140280	149600	to me at dinner. It was a big booth and you guys were coming across. Can we talk about our text
149600	156400	message exchange? Sure. I got nothing to hide. Can we bring Steve Levy out because he has a part
156400	167360	in this. Oh yeah, Steve Levy. I'm sorry if you're here for this. Clean, shaven, freshly cut Levy.
167360	175400	Look at the biceps on this guy. He's the hottest. He looks like Captain America. You look like one
175400	179680	of the guys kind of changing in the background in that locker room scene in Top Gun and you're like,
180640	188920	but you're on Iceman side. I'm just saying, this guy's got fantastic. Also, do you wax? You're
188920	197480	smooth as an eel. What's happening? No, I don't wax. Again, you can subscribe, ladies. Five dollars a
197480	205480	month. Get to see this shit. Okay, so I got a text message from Shrub. Let's see. A couple of them.
205480	216480	I think it was yesterday. All right. First text message. Yesterday, 3.26 p.m. Shrub says, wait,
216480	222120	what should we... What did I... I don't even remember. We should read each our own parts. No,
222120	227200	no, no, no, no. Okay, go ahead. No. Yeah, read your fucking text that you sent me. Open your
227200	235560	iScript, Rob. Open your iScript. You want me to... Yeah, read yours. This is like, like being like
235560	241720	the Steppenwolf. My phone's dead. I mean, I can't. My phone's dead. So go sit next to him and do it
241720	249160	together. No, no, just read it. Just read it. Man, this is the worst. You know, if you would have
249160	253520	mentioned something at dinner, we could have had it all planned out. I didn't know you were gonna
253520	259960	do this. Just sit here and read your fucking texts. I brought Levi out so Levi could read
259960	265200	his in the middle. That's the funny part. It's all the worst. All right. Okay. Okay. Like the
265200	272520	podcast has become like, we're like the unearned popular kids at the lunch table and it's like we
272520	278840	think that the lunch table means we have a TV show. Okay. We're closing in on our 200th episode and
278840	284800	we still haven't figured it out. All right. But there's at least five people in the audience
284800	289480	tonight who have never been here and they're like, what the fuck is this? What is this? Like,
289480	295200	I thought he... I thought he... Where's Chevy Chase? Where's... What's... All right. Just read. So... Am
295200	300600	I reading you or me? No, you're reading yourself. Yesterday, 3 26 p.m. yesterday. Just don't touch
300600	306480	it. See with your eyes, not with your hands. It's too small. I'm sorry. He's got bad eyesight.
306480	319360	Okay. Where is it? Where are we starting? Aren't they adorable? There. Yesterday, 3 20. This is the
319440	336880	worst. Just had brunch with Chris Pratt. Kind of a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's got... Yeah.
336880	356160	Pratt brunch at Soho House. Holy shit. So I let it go. Which makes me feel like you didn't get it.
356160	363960	Oh, I got it. I didn't know that. I thought you didn't hear it. So then, what was it? An hour
364040	371800	later? What's the timestamp? So then I get a text message from Steve Levy. This is from Steve.
374440	385080	Hold on. Here. Here. This is... God, we text a lot. I send you a lot of Vines.
386920	390920	You send me so many Vines. This is even better than going to see Hamilton. This is amazing.
391880	395080	It's a fucking stage craft up here. It's at the top of the screen.
396120	401960	This is three hours after that at 6 p.m. This is from Steve Levy. 6 0 3 p.m.
401960	405080	Shrob wants me to tell you he had a brunch with Chris Pratt.
410440	416040	Well, I didn't know you got it. So I wanted to make sure. In case you were trying to get a hold
416040	422840	of me, I had my phone on do not disturb mode while I was having a meeting with Pratt.
423480	429800	So then I said, my assistant telling me about your brunch with Chris Pratt doesn't make it
429800	441720	dinner with Chris Pratt. At 10 0 8 p.m. 9 14 a.m. So 12 hours later, you said,
442200	446360	it's at the top and just fucking read it. It was a great meeting. He's super friendly.
449320	453000	And then I said, don't you think it's possible he was acting?
459800	465320	Why would he do that? Maybe that's how actors practice.
465560	470760	Maybe making someone think they're your friend is the acting equivalent of catching a fly with
470760	479160	chopsticks. Have you been an actor this whole time?
483880	487800	No, and that's why my friendship is more valuable to you than his.
488680	497640	That's all I wanted to know. Screen grab. All right, that's it. Thanks, Steve. You got it.
509160	516280	When they remake this on Broadway, I think the more coveted role is a Steve Levy role. I think
516280	520680	he becomes the whole. That's the big punch line. That's what I like. I ruined it. I was like,
520680	524360	I shouldn't have never. I shouldn't have thought like, oh, we should read those texts. It should
524360	529960	be organic. See, when you go after something, you kill the butterfly. All right. So I shit my pants
529960	537080	again. Like I went to Palm Springs with my. Yeah, that's what they're calling it now.
537080	548600	I went to Palm Springs before I came on stage, man. El compadre. I went. I was driving there
548600	557000	with my lover. It's a two hour drive. And you've taken a lover did a little Dan Harmon takes a lover.
558360	562440	He's taking a lover. A two hour ride to Palm Springs.
562440	569800	All right. It's just it's it's a story. I mean, it's just okay. Yeah, I was giving you a title
569800	577560	sequence. So I saw it. So I I took a little hit. I grabbed the vape pen. Her vape pen is
577560	584040	differently configured than mine. And I kind of like I took a big full hit. And I and then I
584040	591800	started coughing. And during the cough, like each cough, as you know, I fart largely. And I was like,
591800	597800	those those feel like hot farts, like I was like coughing, like, like, like horrible,
597800	605480	horrible coughing. And for there were four in a row that I was like, that that was a hot fart.
607160	612120	Four in a row. And then and then everything was fine. Then we went on two hour drive. Great time.
612920	617000	I made her a wonderful birthday present. I'm very talented while you were driving. No.
617240	624440	No, I made she's a fan of the Karina Longworth podcast. You must remember this. I made her a
624440	630040	half hour episode of You Must Remember This. I want to hear this. Well, you can't. It's her
630040	637400	birthday present. So we listened to it. She loved it. And and then and then and then she's like, oh,
637400	642520	we're almost to the place. We're about 10 minutes away. Probably this is probably our last chance
642520	653480	to stop grab some snacks stopped at a Walgreens and got out and remembered and felt that you
653480	660280	weren't just making birthday presents. They weren't hot farts. They were. So I mean, the
660280	665000	opening, the opening credits that Rob was making, Rob didn't know the movie was called hot farts.
666280	671320	And I'm saying it's got a Z. I was like walking around Walgreens. And then I went, I was like,
671320	675800	I don't know what's going on back there, but I can tell it's a big deal. Like I don't know.
675800	681160	I don't know for sure. You never know for sure. I'm drinking Soylent a lot during the weeks. And so
682680	686600	thanks. Well, I just I'm telling you that kind of throwing Soylent under the bus because I don't
686600	691400	want you to think Jesus, he's dying. I do shit my pants more than the average person. We've learned
691400	698920	that. But but I also like I'm drinking a lot of liquid. The and then I went back to the restroom
698920	705000	area and the restroom was closed. It was under renovations. And there was like one of those key
705000	710520	code things in the women's room. So I just I slashed back out and like I wish you you would
710520	715480	already let it rip. It's already in. It's already out. They were hot farts, man. Oh, I'm sorry.
716280	721480	You're already you're already carrying the shed his pants for time. I thought you were still like
721480	725320	you didn't know what was. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This isn't like a like a story about like,
725320	729960	oh, it leads up and then let's celebrate the moment of the show. I'm saying this is like a
729960	735240	like, oh, I coughed. And then each cough, I was like, that was a hot fart.
736680	739480	There was a hot fart, too. There was like four of them. And I was like,
739480	746760	if those are all hot farts, why doesn't it smell in the whole car? And if they if they if they
746760	751960	weren't, if they were something else, why doesn't it smell? They and then forgot about them because
751960	755480	I wasn't moving around. So I was like, like, like, oh, I guess nothing's wrong. Got out at the
755480	761960	Walgreens and then felt okay, I could feel right. Okay, something happened. Gotcha. So you shit your
761960	767640	pants. And then and then really, there's almost well, then I had to like, because I was like,
767640	771880	I shit my pants. And it's just like, we'll go to the bathroom. Bathroom is closed. So I was like,
771880	776120	just getting we just gotta go. And I just like, I just went back to the car and I just like sat
776120	782120	down. Did you get? Did you get like, I mean, you could get like, wet wipes and stuff like that.
782120	785800	I hadn't thought about that. But what was I gonna do take them into the like a dumpster or like a,
786680	790520	it was a desert like there's like, like, like, like stack up rattlesnakes and just like hide
790520	796760	behind the rattlesnakes. And you can't sit in the desert, man. Why? Where can you?
799080	805160	I didn't have to shit I'd shit my pants. I'd have to remove my pants. So you went to the underwear.
805160	810600	You went you went to this you went to a wedding. You went to a wedding. Where did you go? There's
810600	817000	a birthday weekend. It was a birthday weekend. Birthday weekend. Okay. All right. And so,
817800	819240	happy birthday. You're back in the car.
822600	827480	I mean, I was telling the story. Like, you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what happened?
827480	830920	You shit your pants? Yes. Then what happened? I'll be right with you.
830920	838360	All right. So you're back in the car. I sat in the car. Like, what's going on? I just held
838360	842120	still and we're in the desert. And then we pulled up to the thing and she's like, I'll check in.
842120	846040	I'm like, yeah, you check in. I'm not going to move. I'm just going to sit here in my shit.
846040	849560	And then I was like sitting there and it was like a while because they're hippies. You know,
849560	852840	I'm out in the desert and it's like some artisanal hotel that probably had to pay and
852840	859400	bark or something. And like the, like, so I'm sitting there and I, I just like, I could swear
859400	863560	that I was hallucinating. Then I could feel something dripping down my leg. Like I, but I
863560	866920	wasn't, I couldn't, I didn't want to check. I didn't want to, I was just one of those sitting
866920	871640	there and just sat there. And then we got to the bathroom or the room and I, and then I looked at
871640	877800	it's just a little roar shock. Okay. That's the end of my story. I shipped my pants. Okay. All right.
877800	888360	Lots to talk about. So, can I, I, I have one question. You're telling me, but you, you, you
888360	894280	did four hot farts in the car, drove to the wall, Walgreens, Walmart, Walgreens. And then you got
894280	900040	out of the car, realized that you had indeed pooped your pants, walked around a little while,
900040	904360	while you're trying to sort it out. Couldn't get into one restroom. Didn't know the key code to the
904360	910600	lady's restroom. Uh, go back to the car, sit in the car, take another, I'm assuming a few more
910600	917160	minute drive back to 10 minutes onto the crib. Right. She goes into the check-in pain with bark.
917160	922840	You're sitting out in a hot desert car, possibly poop running, running on your legs, or you're
922840	929400	having like a, like you're having like a psychosomatic. It didn't smell like shit in the car. No. What?
930120	935080	Cause it really wasn't that. It seems like once it's out of the fucking box, it's fucking.
936120	939080	Yeah. But maybe it's just like, I got a big hairy butt and it's like,
940120	945240	a lot of stuff can be going on up there. God knows that you couldn't eat off it right now
945240	953320	and the room doesn't stink. I think the secret is to be a big wide person with a, with a giant
953320	958680	canyon for an ass. And it's like, cause I was on stage doing an improv show a long time ago.
958680	963640	And one of the, one of the improvisers had to run off stage, like really unceremoniously,
963640	969080	just leave the show like halfway through. And the whole room smelled like, like poop,
970280	974120	but we didn't connect those dots cause it smelled like poop before he left. We thought something
974120	980520	else was happening, but he had indeed completely emptied his drawers on stage. So you just let a
980520	984760	little, no, I've never done, I don't even remember when I've done that, but I have a lot of stories
984760	994520	about like farts gone awry. I probably had said this before, but I might be misquoting it either
994520	1000920	way. Tommy Lasorda, the ex manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Wow. I get finger snaps from
1000920	1005160	Dave Klein on that one. I didn't expect that. He, he, he had some advice for people and I think
1005160	1009720	there was more than this, but he said, never pass, like when you get older, never pass a bathroom and
1009720	1013640	never trust a fart. Right. Never trust a fart. That's the thing. I had to learn that in my thirties
1013720	1018120	that I had to stop. I'd be like, you know what else is on the menu? And then it'd be like,
1018840	1024920	I'll be right back. Oh yeah. So yeah, you've lost the ability to do,
1024920	1028520	to do bit farts. You can't do it anymore. When's the last time you shit your pants, Spencer?
1028520	1033480	I think I was like a 19 or something. It was just a fart gun awry. Yeah.
1033480	1043400	Right outside of a Taco Bell, fittingly. Hey, Jeff, what would the Sam Elliott ad for
1043960	1048760	for, uh, wait, what would it, uh, for, for, for, for,
1048760	1055000	come on down to Palm Springs and go to the all new Walmart. We've closed the men's room
1055000	1063240	because Dan Harmon comes by once in a while. Ladies, the passcode is three, four, two, one.
1065080	1070680	All right. That's Sam Elliott for Walgreens. It's a new segment. I want to do it. Sam Elliott.
1070680	1077880	Check out Harmon Quest on CISO. Hey, Sam Elliott for, uh, I'm going to make you do one too.
1077880	1082360	For Shrobs, Shrobs mama's pussy. Oh, she was on the show. She was on the show.
1082360	1086200	Yeah. Really, you know, really not cool.
1089560	1090920	All the glitters isn't gold.
1090920	1102440	But there's one substance that never tarnishes in my mind and that's Shrobs mama's pussy.
1102440	1108120	Right. Right. Right. Right. Of course. I call it the mother lode. Right.
1110840	1117080	Sam Elliott. All right. It's not cool. Dan Harmon. Uh, I heard on the,
1117080	1122120	I was listening to a talk radio, which I don't normally do. And I heard that. Shrobs,
1122120	1130600	give me like a small business of any kind. Shoe. Shoe. I heard an ad for shoes. I don't
1130600	1134840	know if it was shoe makers or shoe repairers. Shoe business. It's a whole shoe business.
1134840	1139800	The shoe business. It's called, it's called shoe biz. Yeah. Shoe biz. Shoe biz. Also with the
1139800	1145400	Z just like hot farts. Shoe biz. Shoe biz. There was a local spot by iced tea.
1145400	1157640	Yo. Yo.
1161560	1165000	Do your feet suffer from no shoe-itis?
1165000	1175720	Remember, it's not personal. It's shoe business. Come on down to shoe.
1177720	1185960	We got all manner of foot coverings, boot jacks, flap naps, canvas tops, highbacks,
1185960	1198840	round arounds, mule wedges, pumps, double pumps, non pumps, neo pumps, and the revolutionary air
1198840	1203480	nine at shoe. Fuck you.
1211080	1217960	All right. Now, I guarantee you as we, you know, we're, we're toying with searching for
1217960	1223000	sponsorship here. There's got to be a place called shoe biz. Oh, for sure. Yeah. I mean,
1223000	1227480	that's just free advertising for shoe biz. We're just giving the shit away. Dr. Pepper's looking
1227480	1235560	right at camera three over there. Uh, so, uh, uh, during the trip, uh, you guys use Waze sometimes?
1235560	1239880	Yeah, I use that Waze, man. Have you used the Shaquille O'Neal, uh, Waze voice?
1241480	1248440	I haven't heard that. Shaquille O'Neal, Waze voice, uh, says, uh, I don't know if I can do
1248440	1255880	an impression of him. He's like a big guy. And, uh, he was like, hazard ahead. Be careful. Don't
1255880	1266760	cause a Shaq-sident. All right. What he takes that pause, like he's like, get ready to say about
1266760	1272840	police. Yeah. He says the police thing is police reported ahead. Don't be shacked in a fool.
1272840	1284920	My favorite, they used to have Terry Cruz. It was like a Brooklyn nine nine, uh, integration
1284920	1292360	and Terry Cruz was the best because he would be like police reported ahead. It would just be really
1292360	1299720	excited. I used to get in your car and it would just be like, turn, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like left
1299720	1306440	and then go straight. Yeah, it was great. Everybody keep your eyes out for a 1998 Toyota Corolla.
1306440	1315000	It's a Shaq-ter alert. That's about child abduction. Shaq, Shaq doing an Amber alert.
1315000	1320200	Amber and Shaq-ter alert. I thought, I mean, it was like, I thought the car was stolen.
1320920	1325640	Oh yeah. You didn't mention a child. Look, we'll pick it up in post.
1326360	1336040	Uh, I haven't eaten much today. Hey, okay. So game of thrones, which we'll get, you know,
1336040	1343080	we're all missing tonight. Thank you for, I already saw it. Yay. So it's a good app last week's episode.
1343080	1348440	Now these aren't spoilers. I'm not going to, I don't think I already did that last episode. I
1348440	1353800	think I really spoiled some stuff for people. Did I? Yeah. I mean, I don't know about you. Some
1353800	1359560	people did. It's fine. Let's move past. That's why, that's why you say spoiler alert and they're
1359560	1362520	supposed to put their fingers in the air and go, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Yeah. Yeah.
1363800	1370840	This episode, not tonight, but last week, I finally have a girlfriend who
1370840	1376040	also like me likes to watch all television and movies with the subtitles on closed caption.
1376040	1380200	Yeah. Can't ever understand what the fuck people are saying, especially in that show.
1380200	1386120	You're from house. What gibberish. It's gibberish. Also, so many names start with the same letter
1386120	1391160	and the same. And they're all vowels and it was like, for our, oh, for our, oh boy. And now I
1391160	1396760	know everything. What letter do they all start with? You got a teary and a tie, when a Tom, when
1396760	1403000	Timmy taps a tubi dupes. So did you see the scene where the, they're in the, they're at King's Land?
1403000	1408680	I think Timmy dupes. This is his season, by the way. They're having the, uh, uh, King's Landing,
1408680	1414280	like the, the, the workplace comedy, King's Landing, uh, boardroom meetings, you know, where,
1414280	1419880	where Cersei's kind of like, guys care, WKRP needs to get to get his profit margins back up.
1419880	1423560	You know, it's like, it's like this, like the, they have those scenes where it's like her little,
1423560	1428520	like, like unwilling minions are gathered around the table. And the, the guy, the old guy, the
1428520	1436040	bearded old, old fucking guy with the bathroom, the guy that, the guy that in one episode they
1436040	1442280	revealed when everyone's out of the room, he's, he's only 70, not 90. Remember that? Remember that
1442280	1450520	scene where he was like, they left and he was like, Oh wow. You're only pretending to be 90.
1450520	1456040	You're 70. And that's cool. Uh, that'll come into play. That'll pay off. Yeah.
1457720	1464920	There's got to be like, like, yeah. There's going to be an 80 year old chasing him. This is my chance.
1467000	1471800	He's going to catch him by a decade. Wait a minute. What's going on? It's like,
1471800	1476200	they cut down to the verbal can't Kaiser. So they like, like shot of the feet. Like,
1476200	1482280	wait, that's not a 90 year old's gate. That's a hobble. That's a full hobble.
1483480	1486280	The unit guys in Iraq and everyone, we have a serious problem.
1486920	1489800	There's a slam dunk contest in 45 minutes.
1490520	1498520	Yes. Uh, the, uh, the basket will be of course lowered each time around is failed,
1499080	1507240	but it's the opponent is 85. And as we all know, our champion is a sharp 90. Uh,
1509080	1517000	anyways, that guy was talking shit about, uh, you know, Darth zombie man, the, the fucking like guy,
1517080	1523800	the, the, the, the mountain, the mountain, it got turned into a, like this guy. Uh,
1523800	1528440	and, uh, he's talking shit about him. He's doing the old, he's right behind me. Isn't he? Uh,
1528440	1532600	cause he's like, that thing ought to be, you know, you gotta put that thing to death. Like,
1532600	1538040	as far as I'm concerned, that thing's like crazy. And it's like, chomp, chomp, chomp. Like it's a,
1538040	1545080	coming up in the frame. And then he turns and goes, uh, and then he, if you're watching it with
1545080	1551720	the subtitles, like you know for sure what, what's up. Like he, he looks and then there's a beat
1551720	1557480	and then he farts the care. It says, and it says in the subtitles, farts.
1559240	1564440	And there's like a little sound. What's going on at game of thrones this season?
1565640	1569560	Do you think they hot farts, do you think they added that? They could, they might,
1569560	1572440	do you think they added that in a post or do you think that was scripted?
1573080	1577000	If you knew, if you knew how many farts I had to actively suppress in community,
1577000	1587480	like, like, cause God bless them, but audio engineers, they're, I mean, they, they got to
1587480	1592600	make their own fun. Like, like, and they, they will have a track of the entire show
1592600	1596680	if they've had time. Like, and they're like, of course we could, you know, well, Glenn's in the
1596680	1600120	bathroom. We could play the, uh, play it for him. And then they play it and it's just like,
1600120	1604760	there's horse winnies and like hooves and farts and everything's a fart. And like,
1605480	1611240	the Wilhelm scream is all lines of dialogue. And like, and it's just like, guys, I love your craft.
1611240	1616120	I love what you do. It's very important to me, but everyone can't be farting all the time.
1616920	1620760	And I think this is like, like, yeah, they were like, like, they must have like, like,
1620760	1625800	maybe they said, like, call George RR Martin and, and, and cause, you know, we're, we're having a
1625800	1629960	debate in the mixed bay. And he's like, I'm just the writer. I'm working on the books.
1630520	1632600	And they're like, there's a fart. And he's like, I can't hear you.
1633960	1638360	I hope we get more young Hodor. I want like a young Hodor spin off. Remember when he was
1638360	1645400	a little, little young teenage Hodor. I hope that whole storyline. Oh, I'm loving it now.
1645400	1651000	I'm loving it now. You like, you like the brand. You like the log brand loving it now. Yeah.
1651960	1656440	Now that, now that Branson is awkward years. Yeah. I'm all over the Wikipedia. I'm reading
1656440	1661080	stuff. Things are interesting. It's crazy. Are you being sarcastic? No, no. It seems like
1661080	1666600	it's leading somewhere where it could be leading somewhere. It's completely like new,
1666600	1671720	weird territory. That's like never done before. I hope so. I hope it's not more
1671720	1677400	eye white animal occupying. I don't, I don't, and I don't want to hang out in a tree anymore.
1677400	1682600	And I don't want to walk through holodeck flashbacks. I don't like, look, what am I
1682600	1685880	complaining about? It's a good show. It just seems like the season's kind of like,
1685880	1689240	Hey, what if, what if they had a meeting? Yeah, there was a whole season where there
1689240	1695160	was no crows. I was, I was okay with that. Like one, I'm not sure. Okay. Well, this is a good
1695160	1700760	question. Unless you're not into Game of Thrones and wandered in here tonight. What, what, what is
1700840	1707320	the, like of the, of the, of the, of the, of the 19 like places you can cut to in a Game of
1707320	1711640	Thrones episode. Like what really like, like what's the top one for you that you're, you're like
1711640	1716840	leaning in. Give me a moment to think about that. I recently asked somebody, what would be the
1716840	1721560	shittiest if you were an actor? When we had a, when we had Grey Worm on it, like, what was the
1721560	1725240	shittiest gig? We talked about that here. What would be the best one? Do you have one already on
1725240	1728600	hand? I don't really, I don't know what my answer to that is. I think what's, what's the one where
1728600	1734760	everybody's fancy? Like the, where the seat of power is. What's that one? Yeah. That's probably
1734760	1740120	King's Landing. But, but Dinklage is out of there now. Like that's, yeah, that was my favorite was
1740120	1744840	when he was there and he was like hand of the King and he was hanging out and stuff. Okay. Anyways,
1744840	1752760	what, what a dumb podcast. Stupid ass podcast. But really, where would you get Game of Thrones
1752760	1756760	conversation if, if this podcast didn't do it? This is your only place on the internet to find
1757240	1761400	out. All right. Let's get back to the stuff. Only we can provide. So are there any women with big
1761400	1769640	boobs in here that wait for it? Like, do you have a problem with seat belts? Okay. That sounded like
1769640	1776040	a lot of big boob women. That sounded like a unanimous consent in that one. Do you, do you
1776040	1782200	put how many of those women, uh, uh, I don't know how to measure it because it's by applause.
1782760	1787240	I don't want, I don't want to embarrass you. I want to give you your privacy, but, but, uh,
1787240	1791160	like, like, I guess you said yes. When I said you, do you have big boobs? You can say it the same way.
1791160	1797720	Do you put the seat belt behind you? That was a, that was a, that felt like, that felt like there's
1797720	1804040	12 women with big boobs in here and four to seven of them drive with the seat belt wrapped behind
1804040	1811160	them because it disturbs their boobs. Just a thought started dating someone with big boobs.
1811240	1815000	And I'm, uh, I'm an advocate and I, and I want you to be safe in the car.
1815960	1821480	Yeah. So so one of you that, uh, gals that drives with it behind, like you're sacrificing the
1821480	1827720	shoulder strap and you're just doing the lap belt. Really? The illusion of safety. So is it,
1827720	1832120	yeah, you might not be flung out of the car. You'll just be smashed into the dashboard head first.
1834680	1840360	That's a bummer. Is, is, is, is there anybody, is there anybody like, like travel safety,
1840360	1843720	whatever that's called, like working on seat belts that can accommodate that?
1844440	1847400	In, are you asking if there's any way in here? No, I mean, like,
1849560	1852760	Professor Mortem, Mortem, Handa.
1854200	1859000	I, are people currently like working on, I doubt it, remedying that. Yeah, probably not.
1859000	1863880	And I feel like, what? There's that, um, as seen on TV where it's like a sleeve.
1864600	1874120	Oh, oh, oh, like there's like, I got there. People sell a, uh, like, uh, yeah. Is that supposed to
1874120	1881240	ease the, but that doesn't work, I'm assuming. Wait. Okay. So the boobs lift the belt and make
1881240	1890840	it like a braid your neck. So look, I don't want to white knight the situation, but look, uh,
1890840	1897400	body, body shaming. I'm saying like, like, if it's not getting addressed, it's because,
1897400	1901720	you know, how, you know, like we've done a number on women, like how many of them are going to write
1901720	1907240	to anybody and say, I've got giant tits and I've got a problem with that. Like, like, like, none of
1907240	1913320	them are going to do it. A lot of them are driving around. Like, like, uh, you know,
1914200	1921560	anybody that's, that's crazy. It's like, and it's like, you know, like, like, yeah, like, like, uh,
1921560	1923320	what did I have the same problem with the lap belt?
1935640	1940360	That's exactly, that's the customer service line when you call and you're like,
1940440	1945000	seriously, like you're disturbed because you just had a near accident or you lost a friend and you're
1945000	1948840	like calling and you're like kind of crying and like, and then the guy's like asks you like eight
1948840	1952280	questions and then you go, it's like, okay, I'm just getting this down because, because it's the
1952280	1958120	same with me and the lap belt. And then you hear three guys laughing and then they, and you just
1958120	1967400	hang up and curl up in the corner. Sob. Um, yeah, well, well, ladies with big boobs, let it be said
1967400	1976920	to hear first, I am on your side. Dan Harmon, ladies with big boobs. Ladies and gentlemen,
1976920	1985560	Sam Elliott for big boobs seat belts. Oh boy. Uh, I was going to go to a really dark place.
1985560	2001240	What are you making this, Rob? Uh, I dropped my microphone a little bit.
2001800	2011000	I dropped it. It was on my, got on my foot. We here at BMW have a whole new concept about the
2011000	2018200	way cars should be driven and driven in. You got some big old hang down floppers.
2019400	2022200	You got some big old out front punching rounds.
2025080	2028600	He's going into the different kinds of breasts.
2030440	2034600	I don't know. Don't, don't make me do a commercial for titty safety.
2034600	2041320	What else do you got? Your, your bosom deserves a respect.
2043320	2047480	Ice tea for titty safety. Why doesn't he have a rap beat?
2049240	2056840	Because he's iced teas. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't play a Nashville music when you're doing
2056840	2060840	Sam Elliott. If I had it, I would play it. I'm not allowed to play licensed music anymore.
2060840	2068120	Yeah. Just look, if you're going to pimp me to do ice tea endorsements, don't play a beat
2068120	2071720	because I'm not going to rap to it. Then it's just going to, it's just a sound. All right.
2071720	2081960	Ice tea for, um, for man space exploration and then the funding thereof.
2083720	2086600	We've been on this earth for over five trillion years
2086600	2092280	and we still can't get off it. Shit.
2099000	2104600	It don't even matter to me personally. What's out there? It's a principle of the thing.
2105160	2111880	You gotta get my ass off this planet. If you feel the same way, write your congressmen.
2121320	2126280	That was pretty good. Yeah, I liked it. The beat was fucking me up. I liked it.
2127560	2131800	Okay. All right. What else is on here? I got, okay. Well, I, you know, I said I had a lot to
2131800	2135000	talk about, but I'm really realizing it's just a bunch of dumb cutesy shit that like,
2135000	2142520	cause I was in love all weekend. So I was like, I was at, I said, I said, and throughout the week
2142520	2167240	also, yeah, I threw a little china.
2172760	2177960	What was that? You, did you talk about it on the show yet? The fact that you drove in an
2177960	2183480	Uber with a dude who was like full blown flat earth, uh, guys. Did you talk about that here?
2183480	2188120	I don't, I don't think we did. Did I? Oh dear heaven. I totally forgot about that.
2188120	2194120	There's still flat earth people and they're down to talk. This guy was, he seemed like a reasonable,
2194120	2199880	rational, like sober individual who, like he was articulate. What music was playing?
2202520	2206760	This is ice tea.
2213880	2221080	This guy, he stuck his head in the window for a second. He drove away. Sorry. I guess you're
2221080	2227320	busy. I'm going on a coffee run. Oh, you guys are going. I left, I left an ice cream truck or
2227320	2230920	something. This was a month and a half or two months ago, probably. Right. I left a Harmon town
2230920	2236040	here and I got into a lift and the dude had, sometimes people put their, their ways, their
2236040	2240360	phone, like, like on the dash or on suction cups at the window or up on their visor or different
2240360	2250360	places. Where else? Uh, are there other places? Sometimes, sometimes. And they're passengers,
2250360	2256920	big titties because, oh yeah. Yeah. Cause it keeps the chafing on the neck. Uh, so he, but he had
2256920	2261880	another screen up, but he had a big, like, like one of those giant Samsung, like big ones. And,
2262920	2269000	and I'm talking about his dick though. He had a screen up in the visor and he, when I got in,
2269000	2275080	it was clearly like, um, kind of like talk radio, but like with visuals, like, there was like,
2275080	2279960	like just pictures and it was guys talking about science stuff. And he kind of not like rushed to
2279960	2283960	turn it off, but he like, I got in the car, he got the destination and he turned it off and like,
2283960	2288040	what was going on there? He had like some planets in space. He's like, yeah, like it's,
2288040	2291560	you know, it's a science thing. I listened to it. I like science. Like we started talking about stuff
2291560	2296520	and, uh, it was revealed at one point that he is a flat earth believer, flat earther. Is there a
2296520	2304040	name for it? And so he's like, the whole thing is a lie. The earth is flat. And I was like,
2305560	2312520	but okay. Well, so I tried, I tried to come at that Citadel wall, like with
2312760	2316520	through the front gate over the top, but like tunnel under it. You don't want to be a dick,
2316520	2320760	but you're fascinated. It was super fast. And also he was a pleasant guy. And I wish I could
2320760	2324040	remember all the details, but like, I was saying like, but like when you've seen,
2324040	2327160	like, do you believe we went to the moon? He goes, Oh, we did go to the moon. That's also flat.
2330760	2335400	See that is, see, that's amazing. That was like the most flat earth people from whatever
2335400	2340840	I read online. They think that they also are moon hoax people. I was saying, what do you think
2340840	2346840	happens if you walk in a straight line? And he goes, we don't know because the polar ice caps
2346840	2351240	are there. That they're there to keep us from falling off. I go, so this guy, what if we walk
2351240	2354840	around the equator where there are no, is like, but there's no such thing. There's no such thing
2354840	2360520	as that. But this guy, hardcore environmentalists, that's the crazy thing too, is that he's like,
2360520	2367480	he agrees. He's, he's, he's, he's, if, if, if you're dumb enough, you're fucking liberal.
2367480	2373320	Yeah. That's great. We gotta, that's what we gotta do. We gotta, we gotta deny education to
2373320	2376920	conservatives until they become flat earth. There's unbelief that the ice caps are keeping
2376920	2382680	their children dry. So like that, or that, or I'm sorry, not dry because they, what they believe
2382680	2387240	is that if the polar ice caps melt, all the water will fall off the edge of the marble madness level
2387240	2393880	that we live on. So I asked him about what do you think creates gravity? If not, if not that swirling
2393880	2399000	iron core, and he goes, he had a, not a good answer, but he had an answer and it was preposterous
2399000	2404120	and lunatic, but he laid it out nice and simple. He, he talked like this level-headed. Big turtle.
2405400	2411480	It's a big, just a big turtle. Big, big turtle. I said, all right. Big turtle keeping the water
2411480	2415880	down. If you believe that, if you believe that we walked on the moon as human beings and we took
2415880	2420120	photos, do you believe those photos? He goes, yeah. I go, how come you can only see part of
2420120	2424040	that flat disc? How come you, you can only see Africa or you can only see a certain continent
2424040	2428760	at once? And again, he said, well, that's the photos or that, because that's, that's a, that's
2428760	2433160	a good question because here's where I'll tell you why. And then he started making this other weird
2433160	2437480	shit that goes the whole, I go, when you go high enough on a plane or a spaceship that you can see
2437480	2441000	the curvature of this. He goes, no, that's just because the lenses and the cameras are curved.
2441080	2446760	Oh. The, the, the Beastie Boys video theory. So then I said,
2449080	2451080	so what you, what you, what you want?
2453720	2459240	Intergalactic. So, so I said, and I laid down something that I, when I was like,
2459240	2462600	drunk and high and talking to professor Brian Cox about, I said, like, I said,
2462600	2466280	like gravity and all this stuff. I explained what we know what it does, but do we really know what
2466280	2470680	it is? And he goes, well, it's like, or like space time and stuff like that. He goes, we're
2470680	2474920	talking about space time. And he goes, gravity curves things in the same way that like, if you're
2474920	2480200	walking on a curved surface, like our planet, if you and I stood in a straight line along the
2480200	2487080	equator, like a hundred, you know, kilometers apart, and we walked, we both had a compass and
2487080	2493000	we walked due north. We would eventually meet. We would eventually touch. We would think that we were
2493000	2497560	both walking perfectly straight and we were. And if you didn't know that the world was round,
2497560	2502520	you would think that there was some weird force acting upon you. It's no, it's just, it's just the
2502520	2508760	simple curved nature of space, time and planets and anything that has curvature to it. So I was
2508760	2513800	like, if you and I stood on, like, if you and I, like, if we, if I could come up with the money,
2513800	2517480	where you and I could like do this experiment, we drove like a hundred miles apart and had
2517560	2520040	composers walk through and he goes, let's do it. Let's do it.
2522040	2527960	I love that this guy's down for anything but research. He's like, he'll get on a plane and
2527960	2533240	like meet you. What made, what made him crack a book? Did you ask him what made him like,
2534040	2538440	stop believing it? Or did he never believe it? I think somebody turned him on to this idea that
2538440	2542360	we've all been lied to the whole time. It's all been this big bunch of baloney. And I was like,
2542360	2547960	but like, what's the, like, who's putting that myth forward? Who's, who's making money off that?
2547960	2551400	That one, this is, this is the heroic one because that one's got it.
2551400	2553720	You're just making money. The big globe lobby.
2553720	2557000	Like, like, like, like he, he's, as far as I know, unless somebody tells me different,
2557000	2560120	he's really not hurting anybody. And in fact, that whole polar ice cave, like that guy,
2560120	2566680	that guy wants the polar ice caps to stay there more than we do. And so really, he's really not
2566680	2570200	hurting anybody unless he thinks what keeps the earth flat is hitting children or something.
2571160	2576440	But, but, but, but the crazy thing to me is like that, unlike the climate change denying
2576440	2582280	like kind of things or whatever, the vaccination crap that like that, this is a guy who like,
2582280	2587400	he has a belief system that is actually incredibly difficult. I would think like,
2587400	2593160	like you would do like, it's not, it's beyond like, like he has to fucking protect that thing
2593160	2598840	with a, with a, you couldn't, you couldn't say anything that, that seemed to me logical
2598920	2603320	that ever got through like his force field of what he believed in.
2603320	2607400	You think whenever he's like at a movie, you know, and the universal logo comes out,
2608840	2609800	here we go again.
2613080	2615800	Bullshit. Turn it off.
2615800	2619640	That's why he only goes to Dreamworks movies. That kid is sitting on a flat.
2619640	2623000	Right. Right. Yes. Finally. Yeah.
2623000	2625800	Uniforceful. He's a flat, he's a flat move here.
2625800	2629960	But there's a, here we go. It's a point where, where, where close mindedness.
2629960	2631320	Not me buddy. I'm not.
2632840	2639480	Okay. So you have to actually open your mind a bit to get that close minded. Like, like, like,
2639480	2644040	like that's not like, he had to one day, someone had to say to him, there's some people who believe
2644040	2649400	the earth is flat and he had to be like, you know, there has to be some story where he's like, yeah,
2649400	2654760	but fuck those people. And then some spider bit him or something. And he was like, maybe not fuck
2654760	2659160	those people. Like he delivered one of their flat babies in the, in an elevator. I was like, it's
2659160	2665400	human. Uh, like, like, like something happened to him where he was like, maybe the earth is flat.
2665400	2669800	When I got to my destination, I didn't get out of the car. We talked for maybe five, eight minutes.
2669800	2673160	We, I was like, I have so many, we have to keep talking. But he's like, like, like,
2673160	2677320	I'd love to. I'm like, keep the meter running. He's like, I already turned it off. Like, let's,
2677320	2681800	let's just talk about it. He goes, what is it? Like, what's your hangup? I'm like, it's,
2681800	2686840	it's like, you're a lunatic. And he's like, what? I take that back. You're not a lunatic. Like,
2686840	2692440	but this, this is a lunatic idea for me. And he's like, he's like, you have been fed a bunch of lies.
2693160	2698520	And like, it's all a bunch of lies. I was like, but why? What's the, how do you start exactly?
2698520	2704920	How do you, was this lift or Uber? People are, uh, okay. So there you go. So that means he's got
2704920	2708840	a podcast on the way there. I said, Oh, on the way that I'm like, we were using, are you using
2708840	2713800	Google or maps or, or ways when he goes, I'm using, I'm using ways. I'm like, how do you think GPS
2713800	2720600	works? If it's flat, you can't, Jesus Christ. What about, what about you could go to the beach
2720600	2725480	and see the ocean and you can see it curving just with your own naked eyes. You could see the curve.
2725480	2730920	That's an optical illusion. Well, then so is anything like you could just say, I'm,
2731320	2734840	you guys can hang out. You guys can hang out. I would respond to that and say, well,
2734840	2740520	if the earth is round, how come everything seems so flat? Like the answer is just, I would just say,
2740520	2744680	but I get that. But if you could see it curving, like, I don't know. Yeah, but I can see it
2744680	2751080	flatting. And the answer is, well, it's a matter of scale and it's a different shit happens. I want
2751080	2756360	to, I wish I want to get in there, man. I want to be, I want to be one. I want to be a doomsday.
2757320	2761960	I was like a couple of things. There was one that was like, okay, if the earth is flat,
2761960	2765160	on a clear day, if we had a really good telescope, wouldn't we be able to see
2765160	2770280	Mount Everest and everything else? Like, I full tower. Like, like, no, he has all this stuff.
2770280	2776360	It was crazy. Clouds. My biggest, my biggest regret about this whole thing is that right when
2776360	2780360	you get out of the car, I was like, why didn't I invite him on Harmon town? Yeah. Because it would
2780360	2784360	have been awesome. And not, not to mock him. No, of course not. We would have fucking like,
2784840	2793320	we would have, but you wouldn't mock him. You would question him. That shit's dumb, man. But
2793320	2797080	you wouldn't, you wouldn't bully him. There's no need. You wouldn't, you would, you would question
2797080	2801560	him. You can't just say, Oh, you can't just have an answer. I could come up with leak. You could
2801560	2807080	come up with lie answers for anything and not, you know, have to example. Okay. Well, just,
2807080	2813400	well, let's make Spencer be a, uh, okay. Sure. Uh, hollow earther. All right.
2815960	2822440	Hey, uh, if, if the earth is hollow, how come, uh, they're, uh, holes? Because it spins.
2828200	2835560	It keeps the shape that way. Uh, uh, uh, when you wait, well, I don't want to,
2835640	2837960	I'm supposed to poke holes, right? Like, I'm supposed to like,
2838760	2843800	I don't know what the exercise became. You're trying to ask hard-hitting. Right. I'm trying to
2843800	2850200	debunk it. Uh, well, I don't really know anything in common day that I can point at that. That's
2850200	2858200	because the government. All right. See, it's easy. You could just say anything.
2859720	2863960	Someone has like a ruler or something. You can't go out and disprove it.
2865720	2871880	This is true. We blew it. I blew it by now. Do you want to, how about Sasquatch? Do you want
2871880	2878360	something else? Sure, sure, sure. Hey, how come we haven't found, uh, Sasquatch skeletons?
2878360	2879800	Because they've been hiding them.
2882440	2884760	Who's they? The Sasquatches.
2886120	2890520	Why are they hiding them? Because that's literally all they do is hide and hide things.
2891480	2899080	They hide skeletons. They're not obsessed paraders. Yeah. They hide the skeletons. Where?
2899080	2906040	In the beach. The beach. Yeah. Why the beach? Because people think they're whale bones.
2907560	2913960	It's fucking easy. You just say anything. All right. Spencer.
2920520	2926040	Let's have Spencer pretend he's someone who believes in the electoral system of the United
2926040	2935400	States. So how come if I live in New York where 9-11 happened, my vote counts for way less than
2935400	2942200	if I live in Wyoming? Because every state gets to determine that. Well, how come we can't just use
2942200	2946440	the technology to pick the president now? You could. You just have to vote to make that happen.
2946440	2954040	That's the biggest argument about the electoral college. It's like, oh, it's broken and fucking
2954040	2958280	vote for it. Assholes. It's stupid. How come all the presidents are either rich people,
2958280	2962680	politicians or people that knew rich people are politicians? Because that's what it takes.
2964120	2970680	That's the system that the forefathers wanted. They didn't just want anyone to be a president.
2971320	2976120	It's true. They didn't. That's true. Yeah. I mean, if anyone was president, a disaster could happen.
2976840	2979880	They just pick some douchebag from a reality show in pizza commercials.
2982440	2989080	I mean, God, mob rule can't happen or else. I love it. I love what's happening. We're not celebrating
2989080	2992760	the total collapse of the Republican party. We're just being afraid that Trump's going to get elected,
2992760	2995640	but we're not noticing that the fucking Republican party. I don't think it's the collapse of anything.
2995640	3000040	I think it's us blossoming into a weird, shitty flower that was always coming along.
3001640	3005640	It's kind of neat. I said a lot of crappy stuff about the bipartisan system as if it was always
3005640	3010280	going to continue and there was no way for it to ever change. But what, you know, it's not
3010280	3013480	necessarily going to make things better, but at least we're looking at like a kind of, it's
3013480	3018360	definitely a shaky year for the bipartisan system. They still have the legislature though. We still
3018360	3022520	got that legislature. Yeah. Where the shit really happens. That's the trick. That's what they've
3022520	3027240	realized. They think that if they lose the nomination, they can still win back legislation
3027240	3034280	and still win that way. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right. I really don't have
3034360	3041720	a lot more. That's getting scary. What's going on in Venezuela? I don't know. Okay. Seems rough.
3044040	3049240	What do you think is going on in Venezuela? There's some kind of horrible apocalyptic
3049240	3054760	economic and health collapse of their entire system. There's like a state of emergency.
3054760	3056600	Dan, that's what they want you to think.
3056600	3066440	Just follow the money. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know what's going on in Venezuela.
3066440	3069640	I don't think they're listening. I think, I think something's horrible has happened where they're
3069640	3073960	like, they're in the dark ages. Anybody here legitimately into, and I don't, don't come up
3073960	3076920	just because you're like, you want to be on stage. Is anybody here like into something
3076920	3081160	like flat earth, hollow earth, chemtrails, like stuff like that? Like I really is a firm ass
3081160	3088680	believer. Firm ass. Firm ass. If you believe in firm ass. You believe, but you get a nice tight
3088680	3092520	ass. It just seems like a loaded thing. Like, yeah, somebody's going to go, Oh, I, I, if I
3092520	3096120	squint real hard, I can be into big foot. And then they come up and they're like, there's a big foot.
3096120	3099720	And we're like really big foot. And they're like, okay, maybe medium sized foot. And we're like,
3099720	3108120	yeah, I'm proud of you guys for not volunteering. Thank you. Uh, but I'm proud of you Jeff for
3108120	3116280	asking though. But also I have nothing to talk about. So thank you for trying the, uh,
3116280	3119960	I let you down. I let you down. I'm trying to help. Let's enter the, uh,
3119960	3122280	there's a new segment. It's called scraping the bottom of the barrel.
3122280	3145560	And you dip a ladle in and nothing comes out. So you go lower. Okay. Uh,
3145560	3150360	here's this, this is scraping the bottom of the barrel brought to you by shrubs mom's pussy.
3150680	3159800	So gross. When you want someone's mama's pussy, you need more than the worst. You need the best.
3161720	3164440	And if you can't get that, go to shrubs mama.
3167960	3173160	What are, what are we doing? It's just not funny. I don't know. It's just not funny.
3173880	3183960	It's kind of cheap. It's not that funny. Well, I agree technically as a, as a comedic craftsman,
3183960	3190920	but at the same time, your attempt to high road me is I just don't think it's that funny. It's not
3190920	3197240	that funny. It's just all right. So, all right. Here's a, here's a, we're still in the segment
3197240	3203000	called scraping the bottom of the barrel. This is a subsection of that called, uh, things I could
3203160	3211400	easily look up and have the answer to in one minute, but decided to write down and then ask on stage.
3211400	3219800	All right. How many you got? One. Let's start with number one.
3224360	3228120	This is, this is the bottom of the bottom of the.
3228120	3231720	You got a barrel.
3237320	3239160	Where does the word surcharge come from?
3242360	3245640	I don't know. Because if you say service charge, I'm going to ask you,
3245640	3249160	why is it so you are? Because it's, I want to guess because it's the bottom of the thing.
3249160	3252360	It's a, it's a, it's a charge they add to the bottom after all the things are tallied. What's
3252360	3260280	the sir? What's a sir is, is a wait. Yeah. Sorry. I heard too much at once. Latin for Latin for
3260280	3268280	under bottom. What country is this? Oh, like, like, uh, surreptitious country of Latin. God,
3268280	3275080	I hate him. I hate him so much. I don't think so. Last time I checked, this was America.
3275800	3286360	Is it the same Latin? Your phone died. You can't use that. Your phone is dead. You're not allowed
3286360	3292520	to use that as a bail out mechanism. Stop, stop it. Stop. Do you want me to charge your
3292520	3298200	phone so you can use that? Would you really? I need to get home. I don't. Yeah. Get them home.
3298200	3307640	That text message thing really got under your dander. Are we allowed to know about this Chris
3307640	3313640	Pratt meeting or what was going on there? Is he going to be a Lego? Obviously it was just like,
3313640	3319080	Chris Pratt was like, what's taking so long with the Lego movie? You know, like what's going on?
3319080	3322760	Should I even do the voice? Maybe someone else would do the voice of the Legos. And then,
3322760	3326360	and they're like, well, why don't you go eat with Schwab? And then he's like,
3326360	3330360	so anyways, um, can I get some more cantaloupe?
3333240	3339880	The Legos are going to be on a pirate ship this time. And he's like, okay. Because I can't hear
3339880	3347080	the sound of you over the 800 million movies I should be doing right now. Like if each of my
3347080	3356120	packs did one movie, that'd be two movies, but. Well, tell it to talk to me about Legos. Like,
3356120	3361480	tell me. And you're like, wow, they snapped together. And uh, can I get another cantaloupe?
3366120	3367720	They're not, they're not called Legos.
3370680	3371720	Companies called Lego.
3372600	3376440	I don't care. You're never going to be friends with anybody cooler than me. So
3378120	3379480	it sounds like he had brunch with one.
3380440	3384040	That doesn't make a friendship. That was my point. He's not friends with him. It's just a brunch.
3384760	3388360	I think, I think you're terrified that maybe one day he will find somebody cooler than you.
3389000	3392680	In order for me to be terrified of that, there'd have to be something terrifying happening.
3392680	3397960	What? Are you saying Rob's incapable of finding somebody cooler than you?
3397960	3408600	I'm just, yes, I am. Yes, I am. So is it like, sir, sir, like surreptitious?
3408600	3412920	No, like, like, like, like, sir, sir name, Titian, sir name.
3417240	3422760	Oh, on. Yeah, on top of like, why did they just say that?
3423640	3427960	Oh, it's like sur la tabe. Yeah, you're on the table. I always said it was under the,
3427960	3431720	I grew up in LA and speaking Spanish, like under the table. That's like when you're drunk.
3433320	3437320	It's like, I'm glad I asked. I should have looked it up, but I'm glad I asked.
3437320	3440120	That's, that's a great, okay, I have no more of those. All right.
3441160	3444440	And we got about, about 50 minutes left.
3446760	3448680	I also heard that. What's going on in Venezuela?
3449400	3454440	Speaking of the French and, and, and, and us using their language, supposedly the expression,
3454440	3459960	that's the ticket, like, yeah, that's the ticket. It comes from a bastardization of that's etiquette,
3459960	3461800	French, like that's etiquette. That's the way you did it.
3463560	3468920	And is it etiquette based on the word ticket? Oh, sorry. I interrupted your take. No, no, no.
3471560	3476680	Is it etiquette based on the word ticket because they like would put up manner signs like up at
3476680	3481400	places and they'd be tickets. Well, it's not funny in any way. Fairly entertained. Are you
3481400	3486040	trying to flat earth this right now? No, no. That'd be amazing if you, if you just, it's a big loop.
3486040	3495560	Anybody see this Civil War Land, Civil War Man show? Yeah. Civil War Man? You see the Civil War
3495560	3501480	Man under ruse? Didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't we find out why he's calling him under ruse? No.
3502600	3505000	Dan and Rob, didn't you write a movie called Civil War Land?
3505880	3514280	Yeah, but that's, it isn't ours. Who's Civil War Man in the movie? John.
3519000	3528120	Okay, let's, who considers himself the like, like, like, like sort of, you're, you're, you're a solid.
3528120	3533960	Yeah, here we go. Feet on the earth, like, like, like, like, you, you went to see Civil War and,
3534760	3539960	and you, and you liked it and you're a big Marvel guy and like, you just kind of hear. There's no
3539960	3543880	sort, no shortage. I think the hand that went up first was over here. Why don't you, you, you, you
3543880	3547160	come up. Are you willing to come up? I, I just forgot to ask her if you wanted to come up.
3548200	3555160	All right. So we got a Civil War movie. What is your name, sir? Ben. Ben? Yeah. Nice to meet you,
3555160	3563000	Ben. Ben. All right. So no spoilers. Tell us the entire movie. But there probably aren't any
3563000	3567080	spoilers to have, right? I mean, they're just, they're just superheroes. They're, they're super
3567080	3573800	in the beginning. They stay relatively super. Is he called Underoos in the beginning of the movie?
3573800	3581000	And then he, and he goes, actually, it's Spider-Man. And I go, oh, I'm sorry. I must have, while the
3581000	3586920	car was driving by, I heard Underoos. That's so weird. You're, you're, everybody is, I'm so
3586920	3592040	embarrassed. I gotta change my phone now. Your name in the phone. All right. He's hung up on the
3592040	3597720	Underoos thing. I am. I am. That's weird. And then some kids are playing with a Captain America
3597720	3603480	toy while Black Panther's running through the garage, right? What? When were they were playing
3603480	3608040	with the toy? You know, when they're running through the garage, Black Panther, it's in the
3608040	3614840	trailer. I'm assuming that that scene is still in the movie, right? Okay. So Black Panther and Captain
3614840	3620360	America are running through the garage and then there's like a family in a, in a minivan or
3620360	3629080	whatever, the mom and dad are talking or something like that. But Rob, why wouldn't there be toys
3629080	3633640	in a universe where the people actually existed when they're, I guess they have firefighters.
3634680	3638680	Wait, the firefighter toys. Is that what you're saying? You're saying that because we don't have
3638680	3644440	firefighter action figures, which we, no, no, no, I'm saying I'm agreeing with you. So, okay. Okay.
3644440	3650520	Well, that's been around since the eighties. The idea that people, that the army man, that, well,
3650520	3657080	no, that's the meta concept of like, oh, if there's a, in a sequel, like, like, oh, the people exist
3657080	3663480	in the real world. And then they have the toys, the merchandising. I don't remember ever seeing that.
3664280	3668360	It happens in like every fucking like name to, I don't know, man. Like it,
3668600	3675720	I can't, okay. I know I can name one, but there'd be like a five minute gap and everyone would get up
3675720	3683240	and leave. It's been all right. So a good movie, civil war. Oh yeah. I really enjoyed it. I've seen
3683240	3689400	it twice now. Whose side are you on? Well, I'm always on the side of Captain America because
3689400	3693720	he generally has the most like straightforward logic. Like, uh, Iron Man is a little bit more
3693720	3700920	selfish. You know, he's, he's out for a lot more his own agenda type of thing. So yeah, he agrees.
3700920	3706760	But, uh, uh, I have to say that the first time I saw, um, civil war, I saw it in this thing of 40x.
3706760	3713160	Have you guys know what's 40x? Okay. So it's this thing that they're trying to, uh, like,
3713160	3717320	they're trying to do like the, you know, the Dolby Atmos and all that kind of stuff. But in this,
3717320	3722440	they have chairs that literally like move with the movie, like all the way around, like,
3722520	3728360	not just like just a little bit. What? Where was it? Around, like up and down. No, where was the place?
3730680	3733880	Someone said, where did you go? And he said around. Oh my God.
3736920	3742520	Was that the regal cinema? Um, but, uh, it's, it's just, no, where did the chairs move? Did it go
3742520	3749160	left and right? I'm sorry. Did they go, did they shake or what? I don't know the address.
3749640	3755560	But they shake and move, but the worst part of it is like that. So they also blow smoke in your
3755560	3761880	face and water and shit. And then when people get punched, they literally punch you in the back.
3761880	3765640	Shut up. No, I'm not even joking. This is how you saw the movie or what do you, that's how I
3765640	3770680	saw the movie. What? Yeah. What? They're just physically abusing people. It's like a carnival
3770680	3774520	line. It's the worst thing ever. I thought it would be cool. Wait, human beings, that's why
3774520	3780040	you want to see it twice. Cause you were like, how about not knocking my ass around? And I'll
3780040	3785400	just have some popcorn. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. Hold up, Ben. Everybody in the
3785400	3789480	theater gets a punch in the back by another human being. It's by the chair. No, it's the chair. It's
3789480	3794840	all mechanical. So the dude that works there named Douglas comes up and people work for the theater.
3794840	3798120	Like, okay. Yeah. So you're getting like the bug's life treatment where there's, you know,
3798120	3804440	but you don't really mean exactly like that. So at a point where you, where it's actually
3804680	3810200	kidney throttling you, like, is it, is it really literally like a character in the
3810200	3814920	movie is getting punched or is it like we're going off a cliff or something exploded?
3817080	3820840	It happens for a bunch of different things. Like, uh, is there any fucking in the movie?
3823960	3830280	I wish you could tell. No, there isn't. No, not, not, it's, it's, it's a Disney movie. So,
3830760	3835640	okay. By the way, he calls him under is cause it's, you know, it's like, he's wearing like,
3835640	3840200	his stuff is made out of underpants. But he made that that would be stupid. He doesn't make it
3840200	3844600	though. Iron man made his suit for him. That's what I'm saying. So now he's, he's calling him
3844600	3849000	out by the under that's all. I was like, if I gave you a t-shirt and I was like, Hey, t-shirt,
3849000	3854360	motherfucker. Yes. It's like, that's your t-shirt. You put that on me so you can insult me with it.
3854360	3859720	That's terrible. That's like a monopoly guy, but under under roos is a product.
3860920	3866360	Right. And he's calling it under roo under roos is a product that was in the late 70s
3866360	3872840	that would have like spider man's symbol on it and Batman symbol on it. And he's calling him
3872840	3877640	under roos. Yeah. Right. Well, that's Iron Man style. He, he like gives everyone a nickname.
3877640	3882920	At one point he calls, dude, I fucking know that. Yeah. But shrub, what are you,
3884360	3889880	is Iron Man saying that he's referencing a thing that went out of style like decades ago. Yeah.
3889880	3895240	That's how long known for like spider man underwear. So he's had merchandising since
3895240	3899240	the seventies. Oh, you're talking about, oh, so you're saying that spider man,
3899240	3903880	you're thinking that he's time referencing spider man, like his own, like branding his brand of
3903880	3907320	under roos. Right. He's looking at him when he's talking to him, right? You're connecting a dot
3907320	3912360	there that I don't think is, it's like, like not all under roos or we're spider man under roos. Yeah.
3912360	3918600	So there's Batman under, so he's going, it's like long jobs because there's Batman under roos. Yeah.
3918600	3924200	Spider man under roos. No, because you got a bat on your chest and you're wearing a gray
3924200	3929400	tights. Hey tights. Hey man, who's wearing tights. Hey asshole. I understand. It's like that, but it's
3929400	3933800	under roos. Then when he has a Captain America, it makes sense. No, it doesn't. You're just
3933800	3939320	connecting a dot that they're not connecting for that reason. It doesn't make sense. It does. No,
3939320	3945240	it doesn't. How low earth are you going to go? Are you going to go see it in the, in the, in the
3945240	3952040	movie theater thing? Do you want to, do you want to go watch it with me? If you take the seat that
3952040	3957640	punches you in the kidney, I don't want to get, I don't want it. We can just go see it regularly,
3957880	3962760	I don't have to have smoke blown in my face. My favorite is seeing it in AMC prime because
3962760	3966760	it's really comfy seats. And then like they have the Dolby. You get delivery overnight.
3969080	3976760	That's Amazon prime. Hey, you know, the guys that directed that movie, they used to direct
3976760	3982840	my show community. Oh really? Yeah. You know, they got that job that way. You know, the paintball
3982840	3989400	episode. I don't, I don't know why I'm angry. They referenced it. Give me a super community
3989400	3995640	reference in civil war. Well, do you mean Dean Jim Rashes? Yeah. Yeah. He is the reference. Yeah.
3996840	4001000	That was, it was a very brief cameo and I was like, Oh my God, I launched a lot of stars kid.
4003880	4012680	Underoos are a t-shirt and briefs. There's no leggings. There's no armings. There's no gloves.
4012680	4019800	There's no hood. There's t-shirt and briefs. And it's sometimes to Wonder Woman. Batman's
4019800	4025560	Spider-Man was a popular one. Doesn't make sense. Underoos. I'm sorry. It doesn't make sense. I
4025560	4029080	will say it was a weird area, but I also can't say I could put my money where my mouth is as
4029080	4036680	far as what Tony Stark should yell out when calling to Spider-Man. Spider-Man. It's on the
4036680	4042520	cover of his comic book that apparently probably exists in this universe too. He does, he does
4042680	4049080	question his name. Why is his eyes squint? It's the robot. Yeah. Tony Stark made his suit. He
4049080	4054680	custom made it. And there's a part where he's talking about the goggles that he wears. And
4056280	4060040	they really obscure your vision, but because his senses are so heightened, they actually help him
4060040	4063960	see better. So I believe Tony Stark made them so that they adjust to his eyes. So they could squint
4063960	4070360	to give him an expression. And that. Okay. So is this version of Spider-Man, does he have web
4070920	4077480	shooters? He made the stuff himself. So Peter Parker in this version of the Marvel universe
4077480	4083880	is in addition to getting bit by a radioactive spider also is so smart that he can make web
4083880	4088520	shooters. Yeah. And that's what actually what makes their, their relationship really work well.
4088520	4092440	Because they're both geniuses. Yeah, exactly. One of them is a superhero because he's a genius.
4092440	4095880	The other one is a superhero because he's a genius and also got bit by a spider.
4095880	4103080	Here's another thing. Here's another thing. So he got bit by a spider and he got all the powers
4103080	4110760	of a spider. He can crawl up walls. He's super strong. He can be telepathic, but he can't shoot
4110760	4115880	webs. Right. And also he woke up there and he's like, how come I can walk on walls and
4116760	4124680	when danger is coming, typical spider shit. I'm connecting this dot to that spider that bit me.
4124680	4131000	And as such, I'm going to use my previously untapped ability to create military grade weaponry.
4132440	4135880	I mean, that was like, that was the comic book. It was fine, but I really, I'm just saying like,
4135880	4140600	I thought that was like in this world where the movie industry takes comic book properties that
4140600	4144920	we love and kind of like demystifies them and like tries to jerk itself off for making everything
4144920	4149720	real. That's NATO bots. That's not just a magical comet. That's why you're made of stone and she
4149720	4157480	can turn invisible. It's like nano technology. But one of the rare instances of, I thought,
4157480	4163240	was, you know, the decision to make Peter Parker just a puberty myth and have him have like,
4164120	4168520	he mutated and he's shooting like fucking shit out of his wrists. I thought that was cool.
4168520	4172920	Anyways, that all comes from the movies, I believe, right? What's his name?
4173640	4174440	Yeah. Toby McGuire.
4174440	4179160	That's what I'm saying. I'm being an old man and saying like, I love, I love Toby McGuire.
4180280	4184760	That's what, that's what I'm doing. I'm saying, I thought that was a cool instance. I wasn't like
4184760	4190520	jumping up and going in the comic book. He invents, uh, you know, like weird, like,
4190520	4194680	like the stuff with the tensile strength of steel that you could shoot. Like the idea that a kid
4194680	4199160	could do that. And then also that's the kid that got bit by a radioactive spider. Is it true that
4199160	4206520	he could shoot out of his feet too? In this one, he built a machine for it. They never,
4206520	4211560	they never expressed that at any point. He might be able to shoot one out of his, out of his ass.
4211560	4218200	Who's your favorite? Do you have a favorite? Uh, sorry, I missed hashtag hot farts. Come on.
4220040	4229000	I missed, I missed off. Come on. Oh, oh. Spiders do it though. Oh, Ben. Oh, Ben. Come on.
4230120	4234680	Oh, Ben. Maybe Spiderman got bit by a spider that doesn't actually create silk.
4234760	4241000	Do all, do all spiders spin? So no, but you're, you're misunderstood. I don't think I'm saying
4241000	4245960	that I'm not going to keep it. I'm saying, I'm saying that I thought it was a clean,
4245960	4250040	nice simplification to say, why don't you get all the powers from the spider bite?
4250040	4255960	Right. Not have to have one in comic book. In that age of comic books, it was like, fine.
4255960	4259560	It was like, like, that's the point of comic books was like, it was like punk rock to be like,
4259560	4263160	like, okay. And then he made these things and he doesn't think when Tony Stark is seeing Spiderman
4263320	4267720	is the first time he's ever, they've ever met. Uh, he's been watching him a bit closely,
4267720	4273880	but this is gross. This is really kind of creepy. If you think about it, it's the origin of Spiderman
4273880	4278920	then, right? Yeah. Well, yeah. So Tony Stark is aware of a product called underoos, but didn't
4278920	4285160	know that Spiderman was one of the lions in the 70s. Oh my God. I think they're going, it's like
4285160	4291080	a slightly alternate universe. Like where like the superheroes, this is the first time they've
4291080	4296680	ever existed, but like the, all like the products and things that we like know and care about still
4296680	4309560	like have happened just without like branding of those characters. A person has volunteered
4309560	4314040	that DC comics exists in the, well, yeah, because there's the, well, and vice versa,
4314040	4319080	right? Because there's the joke of, uh, Oh, I'm sorry. No, not vice versa. The Toby McGuire movie
4319160	4325960	when she says, well, you're not Superman, right? You're not. Okay. Anyways, uh, the, uh, the, uh,
4325960	4332040	what's your favorite? Who's your favorite guy? Tony Stark putting words in my mouth. Uh, yeah,
4332040	4338280	no, I, I mean, like, honestly, Iron Man is the most fun to watch, I think, but, uh, uh,
4338280	4344280	Captain America has the best movies. Why do you think it is that? Well, yeah. Why do you think it
4344280	4350440	is the like, like, what, what? So if you look at, uh, Batman as folklore, like he's a guy who was
4350440	4356520	born rich. Uh, he had tragedy befall him. He, it's like, he's a philanthropist. He's a playboy.
4356520	4360840	He's a billionaire. He uses his money to make a bunch of shit. It's like the obvious parallels.
4360840	4365880	Iron Man, like that's the big thing. Marvel, like even though he's not the most super,
4365880	4370920	what do you, do you, do you, if you thought about that, do you, do you think, what, why do you think
4371160	4376840	why do we like the superhero characters that we like in America? What, what it's okay if you haven't
4376840	4380760	thought about it. I don't know. I've totally thought about this, uh, especially cause like a lot
4380760	4388120	of people like Batman, uh, the best and Iron Man is obviously like a very like close equivalent,
4388120	4391640	but I think the, one of the reasons why I like that people like Batman better is because he's
4391640	4395960	like a lot darker and like has a lot more like intrigue in his past. But we like the guys who
4396040	4401080	aren't super. Even from DC, even to Marvel, it's like, we, we like the not decidedly non
4401080	4406840	super superheroes. Like the superhero got invented, but then we settled into, well, I like,
4406840	4414840	I like this, but we can't, we, we can't have, I, I, I dated a victim that, uh, uh, was a,
4414840	4418520	had her getting her PhD. Nobody even laughed because they're like, yes, everyone you date is a victim.
4418760	4425240	I dated a young lady who, uh, uh, who was full of light when I met her and, uh,
4426600	4430760	I was getting her master had her master's was getting her PhD in media studies and she
4430760	4435480	indoctrinated me into this concept of American mythology being having this really specific
4435480	4440200	slant on hero mythology where we like, we can't decide between the outlaw hero and the righteous
4440200	4445400	hero. So in deadwood, that's swear engine and Timothy Ali, uh, a character, I can't remember.
4445800	4450200	My brain is Swiss cheese because I'm more of an outlaw hero, but it's like, we, we need our,
4450200	4456040	we love, we love our Han Solo with our Skywalker. Like we, it's like caviar on the cracker. Like we
4456040	4461400	want to, so it's, but, so what I can't figure out is, is that, is that why we love in comic book
4461400	4465800	mythology? Sure. We love the fantasy of a guy getting really so mad. He can turn green and
4465800	4468920	then he can fucking do all this shit that we want to do at the bank, but they can't make a good Hulk
4468920	4473160	movie. They can't make a good movie out of it because what we really like ultimately,
4473160	4478600	and the thing that passes hands through all these studios and things, we like, we like rich people
4478600	4483880	because we don't want to be, we don't want to be socialists for God's sake. Like we, we want to,
4483880	4491320	we like rich dudes that are playboys, but then that also decide what am I doing with my life?
4491320	4495160	I'm going to, I should be out there fighting for truth and justice and they use all their money
4495160	4500520	to make like, like stuff. And then they beat people up. So because we don't want to let go of
4500520	4504520	the American dream, which is that one day we're going to be Bruce Wayne. Well, it's still putting
4504520	4508760	someone above you, like a God type figure. But it's also saying like, but it's a fantasy
4508760	4513320	fulfillment. We don't want to have a, when we do fantasy fulfillment, we don't, we don't,
4513320	4517720	we don't imagine ourselves as John Henry. Like, we only go like, I want to race a steam engine
4517720	4525720	and then die trying. Like, like, that's my guy. You know who I love? Jesus Christ. Woke up one
4525720	4532280	morning, said I'm going to cause it. Like I sees it got nailed to a tree. I love him. I got him on
4532280	4537000	all my t-shirts. But it's like, it's like Batman. He's like, it goes and breaks your spine because
4537000	4541960	his parents got killed in an alley. And he's like, why me? And we're like, that's my man. And I think,
4541960	4548840	I do, I do think it's because they have to be rich because not only does that make it feasible
4548840	4553160	for them to do the things that they do, but also we have a fixation in our country where we're like,
4553160	4557400	we don't want to fetishize the poor. We want to believe, we don't want to give up on the idea that
4557400	4562840	we're, we're entitled to become rich. Yeah, that capitalism, capitalism works. So, so if there was
4562840	4568680	like a superhero comic that was like, poor man. And it was like, like, like, like one day his parents
4568680	4579960	got killed from malnutrition. And he decided to put a trashcan lid on his chest and grab a heavy
4579960	4589160	object and go out and fight the real injustice. Property. And we would all be like, no, that's
4589160	4597000	terrorism. It sounds like a Bernie Sanders campaign commercial. There's a guy with a Bernie
4597000	4602200	shirt there. I planned to my, why do you, why do you think people like Batman over Iron Man?
4603880	4608440	Wait, do they? That's what he said. Oh, no, you never said that. Ben, don't let him put a word in
4608440	4615160	your mouth. I mean, I kind of did, but I, I hear more people talk about Batman than, than Iron Man,
4615160	4620120	but especially like the comic book version of Batman, because the comic book version,
4620120	4625720	at least up until recently, was more interesting. The version of Batman than the comic book version
4625720	4629000	of Iron Man, because he was just kind of a rich guy. And he didn't have like, Iron Man was like
4629000	4634680	waiting in the wings. I always loved him. I loved him before. And then I swear to God, I swear to
4634680	4640520	God, he was my pixies. And then, and then, and then Robert Downey Jr. was cast and it was like,
4640520	4645720	holy shit. It was also like, it kind of coincided with like, like we were, well, people my age were
4645720	4650600	like rooting for Robert Downey Jr. in a meta sense. It was like, it's a perfect like coalition
4650600	4654360	prior or whatever you call it, something, something with the word co in front of it.
4655080	4666600	But, but that was a recent thing. Batman was like, he was handed through different studios
4666600	4673400	and television shows and mediums. And he just kept enduring. Because all he really does is,
4674600	4680680	well, I mean, the things that kept accruing as that myth was handed through different studios
4680680	4685960	are the things that popped for us. Like, like, like, it was, it was weird that the Batmobile
4686840	4691640	was part of this mythology and not part of that. And like, but whatever sticks, it sticks. And then
4692760	4699080	I don't care. I'm boring myself. Batman's older. He's more like Paul Bunyan. He's closer to being
4699080	4704280	folklore mythology. Iron Man is like a straight handoff from, from a comic book property to
4704280	4707960	cinematic property where they nailed it. And now we're really into it. Really what he is,
4707960	4711480	he's Marvel's Batman. I'm not a comic book guy at all. Are there any like awesome,
4711480	4718760	like women, like superheroes that you know? Yeah, there is. Nah, nah, nah. Not a single one.
4718760	4724360	Are you flattering my question right now? No, no, no. There just aren't any women superheroes.
4724360	4730920	No, there are. Ben says yes. Yeah. Well, it's Wonder Man.
4730920	4739160	Wonder, Wonder Woman, obviously. Do you have a favorite, do you have a favorite woman?
4740200	4748600	Big Red. Jean Grey. I like Big Red because the, the, the, the cinnamon flavor was so powerful.
4748600	4753560	I, I like She-Hulk actually. She's the, she's the lady version of the Hulk. I always thought
4753560	4758120	she was big. And the lawyer. Yeah. She's a lawyer and she shows up as the Hulk.
4759080	4765240	She, she, she holds out in order to defend supervillains, right? Yeah. Not supervillains,
4765240	4769400	but like, maybe she does. I don't know. I've never read the ones where she shows up as the lawyer.
4769400	4774840	All I know is that she like, uh, uh, she got the powers because she was, uh, the Hulk's cousin,
4774840	4782520	I think. And, and she got into a horrible car accident and she could only live because, um,
4782520	4787160	Bruce Banner was the one who had the correct blood type. So he donated his blood and she,
4787160	4794040	she got the powers and then was, um, uh, she, she, um, she, she liked it. She, she's like,
4794040	4799400	she's okay with being the Hulk. But she, she was already a lawyer before this happened or did she,
4799400	4805480	did she go to the, pass the bar as the Hulk? She went, if it's not already comic book line,
4805480	4810840	I would love that. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm going to try to, uh, okay. So, uh, Ben,
4810840	4815720	anything you're plugging, you got a new, uh, tap dance special coming up for. I actually do.
4815720	4821000	I actually do. Um, I'm working on my, my thesis project, uh, for school. You don't need to plug
4821000	4825960	those. That's I, but I've got an Indiegogo for it and no one's donating to it. Wait, no, wait,
4825960	4829800	wait. I don't understand your thesis. You need funding. Yeah. We've really gotten that back.
4831640	4835640	I thought we just eliminated arts education from grade schools. I didn't know, I didn't know
4835640	4841000	college kids were now going, I need, I want to write a thesis about going on a really expensive
4841000	4847320	vacation. It's a, it's a short film. It's a, I'm making a, it's a modern day Western.
4847880	4851080	Okay. So you have an Indiegogo. Well, tell them about it and they'll let them go check it out.
4851080	4855000	Yeah, sure. Uh, it's, uh, the project is called guns don't lie. It's a modern day Western where
4855000	4864280	these two guys like who like, uh, like, uh, idolize the Western who idolized the like
4864280	4868840	whole Western mythos and everything dress up as cowboys and pull off a train robbery. And then
4868840	4874840	modern technology and stuff gets in the way. All right. I would find it on the, uh, Indiegogo,
4874840	4881160	just type in guns. Don't lie. Guns don't lie. All right. Thank you, Ben, for Ben also.
4884520	4888840	Did you notice a Ben around his wrist? I was going to ask Ben, you have a series of,
4888840	4892680	it's too late now. You have a lot of like, we'll look like band bracelets. Like you got,
4892680	4900520	would you come back? I'd rather speculate about it. I think he's so young that he's,
4900520	4906040	he's been to that many places in the last week. Are they all from clubs, bars, like bands, things
4906040	4927480	like that? Not a scissors convention. That's for sure. Shots fired. All right. Well,
4928920	4933800	well, what I was going to suggest is like, cause I'm zeroing in like, what if we created a, uh,
4933800	4940440	cause I figure if a guy's a billionaire and then he has like technology and he uses it to fight
4940440	4948360	crime and get bit by something. No, you're wrong. No, take the bite away. It's hit by something.
4949640	4957240	We could create a new, uh, superhero mythologies and cash in, but also that's just, I mean,
4957240	4962120	that's just me trying to fill. I got a game of thrones to watch. We could cut it early.
4963080	4967640	Do you know the only comic book that I ever read cover to cover? Scud.
4972360	4978280	Dan, did you ever read Scud cover to cover? What was, what was the deal with that bad guy in the
4978280	4983160	beginning? Whatever happens to him, he doesn't really come back. Yeah. He came back in the last
4983240	4991000	four. What happened? Got his legs cut off. Why? Fucked with Ben, Ben Franklin.
4992760	4994440	It's a great comic series.
4998440	5005560	Um, uh, any of you guys, uh, follow the vine, uh, account. Uh, what is it? Amazing talent.
5007240	5012120	Amazing talent. Shrops sends me all these. Shrops sends me these vines. Anybody see it?
5013080	5018200	And it's, I can't believe the amount of people that this planet is generating that are falling
5019240	5023720	like it's amazing. Like it's, it's heaven. It's a vine is amazing. I fully support it.
5023720	5027240	You could swipe through and it's just people getting hit with things and falling. I don't
5027240	5030920	like the, I don't like, we don't like the, you know, if it looks like they really got hurt.
5032120	5035480	Nothing's funnier than people falling down and not getting hurt. People, I don't like when they
5035480	5039000	actually get hurt. Like if you ever, it's like when I was at USC, I was just sitting on like
5039000	5043320	on the grass reading the book and it was kind of a lazy day. Like school wasn't in session and I
5043320	5048120	heard this like footsteps. It sounded like high heels. I look up and there's this young girl,
5048120	5052040	like I got a lot of books and she just like trucking down the cobblestones of USC and she's
5052040	5056040	really moving. She got to be somewhere. And she just hit the ground like a mousetrap closer
5057080	5062600	and books everywhere. I was like, Oh, like, like, do I have to call 911? Like they should, I, I, I
5062600	5066600	was getting, I was getting up to go see if she needed any help, but she got up and she was fine.
5066600	5074280	She dusted herself off and I was like, adults wiping out is the best. I don't know how to,
5074280	5080280	like, like I get a vine from shrub and then it's always some crazy thing and then crazy. Okay.
5082040	5085240	If I swipe in different directions and get different results, but I don't know what's
5085240	5089080	happening. I feel like I'm, I'm in a dungeon crawler, like, like, like game where I'm just
5089080	5093560	like swiping and then like, go ahead, like, how come? And I don't understand why if the account is
5093560	5100440	like Latino people be like, and then it's like, but it's just dogs falling downstairs or like
5101400	5106040	a guy farting at an ear of corn. And it's like, there's nothing Latino happening. But, but, but
5106040	5110040	like that account, I guess maybe got popular and it was like people we need to aggregate.
5111240	5115880	The, I don't know, but I'm swiping and I don't know what I'm following and what I'm browsing,
5115880	5121240	but I know I love vine. But I, but the weird thing is that most of them are
5121240	5125800	comedically based. Most of them are based on the six second kind of orgasm of like,
5125800	5131400	you're watching something and then something's going to happen. But then it's like a certain
5131400	5136680	percentage of them are like, there's this one that's like, I think it's called amazing talent
5136680	5144360	or something like that. And it's just, it's mostly just teenage girls. It's, it's singing,
5144360	5148040	but there's no irony that a basket, you keep waiting for a basketball to fly in
5148760	5155000	a clobber on because you're like in this vine traumatic stress disorder mode. And you're like,
5155000	5160520	like, wait, wait. So then it's just a girl singing kind of well for six seconds. Like, like, oh,
5160520	5166120	yeah, no, that's not a good example. That doesn't, they sing well, but then the captions are just
5166120	5170120	like, Oh, she sings so well. But then it's like, they just keep popping up. And it's like,
5170120	5176360	I realized today, I think, I think about 40% of the public sings well. And I don't think it's a,
5176360	5184840	I don't think we can call it a talent anymore. Sorry. I think it's, I think it's like being
5184840	5192760	double jointed or, or people like me who like the smell of skunk. Like, I think just like 40% of us
5193560	5197800	can carry a tune. Rob, do you sing? And I don't, I don't know if you should, I don't know if you
5197800	5208840	should think of it as being talented. I'm just worried. I'm just worried because they're usually
5208840	5213000	singing another person's song and they're not playing an instrument. And I'm just worried about
5213000	5217080	these young ladies. I believe that they think you should do that. And you should like make a chair.
5220200	5224040	If you're listening to me out there, like, I'm just worried. He wants you to bury your dreams
5224120	5229480	and start making him chairs. Make Dan Harmon a chair and stop being such a singer. So when I
5229480	5241080	send you a vine, do you watch it immediately? No. Do you watch it at all? Yes. Okay. All right. So,
5241720	5245000	so when you don't respond, I shouldn't send it again. What am I supposed to type?
5245160	5257400	Ha. Vine-a-palooza. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You don't have to, but, you know. This friendship.
5257400	5260680	I feel like you guys are getting closer before our very eyes. I feel like this is like you keep,
5260680	5267320	like, I think you guys are, it's, it's, it's, it's fake to pretend that you guys don't really
5267320	5274520	love each other. Right. Sure. I'm doing my half. I'm doing it. You know, I keep them around
5274520	5279240	because he's confusing. Like, to me, like, I'm going like, like, what is he doing? What does he
5279240	5286120	mean? Hasn't that always been the case since you guys were youngsters? No, I used to, I used to,
5286120	5290920	you know, we were like the two musketeers, but then we, and then like, like, but now we're really
5290920	5295000	old. I think our brains are dying and I'm just like, I feel like we're both on just like the
5295000	5301560	rocking, the rocking chairs of life and like, it's getting really funny, but I'm also like really
5301560	5306280	confused. I think I'm, I'm not putting on a character when I'm like, what are you talking
5306280	5312360	about? Why did you do that today? But Rob, you've always been like this, Rob. I feel like, yeah. No,
5312360	5320120	no, it's not true. He's changed and so have I. He's always been this weird. Always. I don't call it
5320120	5329400	weird. I wouldn't, I wouldn't call it weird. He's, there's always some prolonged, huge macro bit
5329400	5333240	going on. That's, that's always been the case since I have known you guys. Well, I don't know,
5333240	5338600	man. You wouldn't, you wouldn't want to live in a world without it. No, I, look, I,
5343480	5347880	I'm just trying to, I'm saying like what you see, maybe you've lost some, maybe you've lost something
5347880	5354760	inside yourself that you forgot how to translate Rob's, you know, unique qualities into, into what's
5354760	5361160	important to you. Maybe it's you that's changed, Dan. I never doubted that. Yeah, yeah, no, I, yeah,
5361160	5366360	sure. Yeah, sure. It's all right. We've gotten very old. Did you, did you ever see the vine where
5366360	5371400	there's like the old guy and it hit like somewhere in Europe and he's like talking to the, it's all
5371400	5375560	foreign language and put that another old guy like comes out in the background and he goes like, meow.
5376360	5385720	They're like really old. I always think like that, that, that could be us. Like one day just like on
5385720	5390040	camera and then like the other guys going and the other guys like, what do you, why you put my,
5390040	5395000	the other guy actually doesn't react. I put my will together. Uh, finally, like I finally,
5395000	5401480	I like hired like a lawyer to get like my will together and I put, and, and, and like he came
5401560	5407880	over to our house and we're going through and he, and he goes, and so, um, if you're like on life
5407880	5413720	support, you're getting, and, and something, God forbid happens to Kate, who do you want to be in
5413720	5420120	charge of pulling the plug on, on you? If, if, if, if that happens. And I said, he's looking at his
5420120	5426600	phone right now. And then I said, and I said, I said, Dan Harmon and Kate goes, Oh, what the fuck?
5431480	5443960	And I go, and if, if something after, I mean, you get, you get first dibs, I would pull the plug,
5443960	5450280	but if you're God forbid, something happens to you, Dan's, Dan's in charge. And I, I don't know.
5450280	5456280	I, and I said this to, to her with the lawyer who I'm paying a lot of money to do this. I go,
5456280	5465240	it's just going to be really funny. See Dan, Dan has always lived. Dan's going to be like,
5467960	5468840	he's going to get Steve.
5472360	5475000	He's good. He's going to make Steve Levy come over and do it. Yeah.
5477160	5482760	That's okay. I was picturing like cheats, cheats on vacation when it happens or something like some
5482760	5487320	deadline. I'm like calling her and going like, are we going to pull the plug or not? Like,
5487320	5492840	she's like, it's my, it's my say. And I'm like, yeah, but you're not here. Uh, I don't know. Yeah.
5492840	5495240	Let's say I did it already. Would you be upset?
5499800	5502760	The guy in charge of the plug was a Rick and Morty fan. And I,
5503480	5506920	we were taking pictures and then we were taking pictures of me pretending to pull the plug.
5506920	5515880	I didn't know if you plugged it back in, it wouldn't just turn back on. It reboots
5515880	5519720	and I didn't have the password. What's the password? That's what I'm saying, Kate. What's
5519720	5525240	the password for his heart and lung machine? Is it too late to make an addendum to your will
5525240	5528200	and say that not only is Dan the guy that does it just in case, but it has to be
5529000	5537160	rig it up. So it's an actual plug into a wall. Yeah. I want, yeah, that's going to be my living
5537160	5541880	will is like, if you're going to put me on lives in front, I want an actual plug. And I want,
5541880	5547320	I want the local, uh, the local lions club to have to like pose and like, it's a tug of war
5548280	5552440	during a pancake. But also it's on a big power strip. Like, is it the,
5552440	5556520	it's the gray one or the big brown one? Hey, who's messing with the air conditioning in here?
5558200	5562040	You could do, yeah, it was like, we spent time thinking about like the terms of our,
5562040	5566840	yeah, the terms of your actual, like, like, like, or have it be like a doomsday clock
5566840	5571640	and make it just characterize it as if like, as you switch Dan Harmon to off, the world goes to
5571640	5575880	shit. Like, you know, there's like sunshine and cows. And then it like, uh, there's like a
5575880	5580120	midnight point in the middle as it goes from on to off, you know, picturing what I'm picturing.
5580120	5585080	I gotcha. And there's like, you know, devils and Sauron and stuff on the thing. It's like
5585080	5592440	Dan Harmon off and it's like, okay, here we go. Like, let's, we, we, we voluntarily enter a world
5592440	5597640	of darkness. Do you have, have you made a will then? I don't, I don't think so. Well, you would
5597640	5601560	probably have to have been there. Yeah, you, yeah, you probably would know. It's not something you
5601560	5608360	can knock out. Yeah. Uh, Steve, did you, did you make me a will Steve? Okay. Uh, Spencer. Well,
5608360	5613720	I noticed when you make, uh, we, we had the restaurant reservations tonight and it was
5613720	5618040	under Levy, not Harmon. So I'm just wondering if you made the will and it was like under Levy,
5618040	5625320	not Harmon. Uh, you gotta keep, you gotta stay vigilant. These kids. Does he have like power of
5625320	5632520	a turning over you? I bet he does. I just wish that he just disappeared and you're like, wait,
5632520	5640360	all my money's gone. Steve. Steve! But that would be, if Steve Levy cleaned me out and disappeared
5640360	5648600	tomorrow, I would, that's money well spent. You got, you got to go ahead, buddy. I always tell,
5648600	5653400	I tell us both, uh, but I've said that to you many times, right? Like acting as my assistant,
5653400	5657000	like, like whenever you have to get like cash or petty cash. Not in so many words, but in cash. But
5657000	5662360	I go like, take something off the, embezzle for God's sake. Like, like, because if I don't notice,
5662360	5666440	then it's fine. Yeah, then you deserve it or something. Right, right. Because if it's possible
5666440	5670440	for you to take, if I have so much money that you can take some and I don't notice, then have some.
5672040	5680280	Because I could die any minute. Take my money. Not you, but, but I'm like, I hear, I'm kind of like a
5680280	5685640	Batman or Iron Man. Well, you clearly love Iron Man. You keep bringing that up. You, you, you,
5685640	5690200	you, you identify with the Tony Stark character, right? Well, I, like, yeah, but I, and I think I,
5690200	5696040	I fight, I fight, I fight, I fight, I fight my own, I fight, I fight the forces of my own discomfort.
5697480	5705000	Glurp, Glurp, Glurp. No, that was me doing comic strip like Glurps.
5705000	5707960	Sound effects. What's Iron Man's Lex Luthor?
5709320	5713800	It's a hammer, right? The Hammerman? No, Hammer. What's his name? Hammer.
5714600	5718760	His problem, his problem is that people steal his suits and then he's like, oh no,
5719400	5723640	that's my whole deal. I relate, I relate to that character.
5725720	5729000	Wait, who? Somebody, somebody comes in to steal my suits?
5730040	5735800	No, for sure. I'll go crazy. Yeah. Leave my suits alone. Honestly, I have terrible nightmares about
5735800	5740440	people fucking up my suits. But if I identified with anybody the most, it would be Lex Luthor,
5740440	5748040	I think, like, like, but it's not. Me? No, me. Me. Okay. Because Lex Luthor hates Superman.
5748760	5755240	Iron Man doesn't hate anybody. Who would you cast Rob as if you had to cast him as a DC or Marvel?
5755240	5761560	Gotta go, like, I got definitely like getting an Aquaman vibe from him. I feel like.
5761560	5767560	How about Spencer? For sure, like, like, like Tron.
5767560	5774280	You know, Tron. Famous superhero. How about me? Who would you cast me as?
5774280	5776680	You, I think you would make a good Black Panther.
5782520	5786120	Are they political? Why is he a Black Panther? I don't know. I don't like the sound of it,
5786120	5789320	though. That's why I haven't gone, because I don't see in that, you know, to do that lens.
5789320	5799800	Shrob looks like Professor Xavier. Yeah. I mean, looks like. He's got the eyebrows.
5802520	5808200	Who would you cast Dave Klein as? Dave Klein. Oh, Dave Klein. Well, he's Thor, right? I mean.
5808200	5812280	He's Sabretooth. But are we going with, like, physical looks? Like, I would say,
5812280	5816120	if I was going to get serious, I would say, okay. Essence-wise. Essence-wise,
5816200	5821720	Shrob would be like. Shrob is like. He's definitely a villain. Like, he's like.
5823320	5828680	He's like a mister. It's like a flash. Dustin said the Riddler from backstage. Yeah, that's good.
5830680	5837880	Yeah. Sorry, Steve said it. See, he's stealing Dustin's lens now. Yeah, that's good. That's fine.
5838920	5843960	This doesn't seem fruitful. I don't know. Hey, man, we're just making our way in the world.
5843960	5848760	You okay, Dan? No. Did you get a little high?
5851640	5856200	I'm like Sherman Capote on. You became kind of a cute and smiley and rolly polar.
5856200	5858920	Well, I'm just running off the clock. I mean, it really just turns out I didn't really have
5858920	5862840	anything to talk about tonight. These people didn't come here to watch you run off the clock.
5862840	5866360	They came here for high-grade entertainment. No, I know. I'm trying to figure out how to make it.
5866360	5871800	Give these people entertainment. I want to. I do want to. I want it to be.
5871800	5874680	Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice.
5879720	5881080	Hey, Iron Man.
5886920	5891000	Check out what's going on on Vine. Bring it up on the screen, computer.
5893880	5898280	Check this one out. You swipe left. I'm going to eat this donut so much.
5899240	5901960	You motherfucker. I'm going to eat this donut so...
5903000	5911880	Freeze it. Enhance. Enhance more. Enhance even more.
5914920	5922360	Back up a bit. You enhance too much. Iron Man, take a look at that. Oh, my God. It's
5923000	5932840	Doom-Namatron. Doom-Namatron is on Vine. Get your phone out. We got to get more hits than he does.
5934120	5936600	More loops. I'm not good at improv and just
5936600	5940440	stole a villain's name from an upcoming episode of Rick and Morty.
5940440	5949880	I just stole it. Doom-Namatron.
5949880	5953960	But I think I wrote it, so I think I can steal it. But I don't remember.
5954760	5957800	Okay. Sorry. You think you have a will.
5957800	5960920	Let me take another run at that. Okay, back it up. Back it up.
5960920	5964040	All right. Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice.
5964040	5970440	Hey, Batman. Oh, I'm Batman.
5970440	5978920	Yes. What's up lately? Does it seem to be a lot of crime happening?
5979480	5985800	Well, you start by trying to take back the night in your hometown, and then at some point you
5985800	5993080	decide to move into a Hall of Justice. Yeah. And suddenly your character takes out a strange,
5993080	5997720	weird comic relief quality. Yeah. It's a weird time we're living in.
5998920	6002200	It's like my whole dichotomy was about innocence and guilt and
6002200	6005240	justice and things, and now I just hang out with Aquaman.
6005240	6009080	I know. I know. Seven corner pocket.
6011640	6017000	Fuck! You know who I don't like? Excuse me.
6017880	6020200	It's me, Alfred. I just came to see if you were...
6020200	6021080	Auschwitz? What?
6021080	6022920	Alfred. Oh. Alfred.
6022920	6023480	What?
6023480	6024280	Alfred.
6024280	6025240	Get the guns!
6025240	6029960	I work for you forever. Alfred. I'm here.
6033720	6036920	Okay. Let's put his head on the wall.
6043240	6046680	I can't believe Auschwitz would think of coming into the Hall of Justice.
6047560	6053000	How did he make it past the... You know, I like it. I like it. I like it when the
6053000	6059240	villains come to us. It's like E24. We don't have to go outside or anything.
6059240	6064520	What the... I'm Auschwitz. Why did you kill your butler, Alfred?
6069640	6071720	Awkward. Awkward.
6072760	6075640	Oh shit. Oh shit. He went through seven layers of glass.
6077320	6079320	I'm sorry. Hey, I didn't get your name, by the way.
6079320	6080840	You called me Aquaman twice.
6082040	6087240	But you started over. Okay. And I became Batman as far as I knew.
6087240	6089320	Right. You called me Aquaman twice.
6089320	6095560	All right. Fine. Find a river and take it to an ocean that could help you chase that guy.
6098280	6099080	Meanwhile, I'll...
6099080	6103880	Oh, shoot, Batman.
6104600	6107880	Getting in my car. Barracuda. Drive that shit.
6109960	6111240	That guy's so slow.
6111240	6112040	Drive it.
6112040	6115400	Send the Bat... Alfred? Alfred.
6116920	6124360	Oh shit. Oh shit. All right. All right. Okay. I think I know how to do this.
6124840	6128120	Go, go, Batman. Bat. Pack.
6130440	6133720	Soaring up through the foyer of the Hall of Justice,
6133720	6138600	their Batman goes through the opening dome, justice dome.
6138600	6142760	And into the sky. Seeing Aquaman and the river below,
6143400	6147080	they give each other the Justice League salute as they head...
6155160	6158520	I'm going to Tron's house.
6161560	6162760	Was he riding a bike?
6163800	6165000	It's a head-up boat.
6168200	6170200	Yo, Tron, let me in.
6170200	6170680	All right.
6170680	6171400	It's Aquaman.
6173800	6174920	Tron, let me in.
6174920	6175880	It's open.
6179320	6182600	Hey, what's up, man? What do we got going on here, huh?
6182600	6184360	Man, you know who I don't like?
6185080	6185800	Batman.
6185800	6187000	Batman's a dick.
6187000	6190200	Yeah. His parents, they sucked.
6190760	6195160	Yeah. A long time ago. Get over it.
6195160	6197880	Yeah, man. My parents died.
6198680	6198920	Yeah.
6199560	6200840	You don't see me talking about it.
6200840	6203480	No. That's why we hang out.
6206200	6207160	Where's the bong?
6209400	6210440	You're sitting on a man.
6210600	6212600	I turn this whole couch into a bong.
6212600	6215400	I'm always sitting on bongs. That's one of my things.
6221480	6222280	Oh, man.
6225640	6227080	I'm sucked on that shit.
6227960	6230200	This is the new cyberweed, man.
6230200	6234280	Yeah. I'm going to blow that out of my gills.
6241240	6245800	But meanwhile, in the skies over Gotham,
6248040	6249560	I can't remember where I was going.
6252440	6253560	What was that? Prime rib?
6253560	6253800	What?
6255320	6255640	What did you-
6256200	6256840	Bong rib.
6257560	6257960	Bong.
6257960	6259400	That was back at the other scene.
6259400	6262040	Right. That's, you know, he was, he wants me to do that too.
6262040	6265640	But I, there was a thing we were going to talking to you because-
6266680	6268520	No, you just decided to leave, I think.
6268600	6272200	You were going to go get Doom Namatron.
6272200	6275000	Oh, right. Yeah. I'm almost, I'm going to go get Doom Namatron.
6275000	6278040	It's me, Alfred, the ghost of Alfred, your butler that you killed,
6278040	6279720	you fucking piece of garbage.
6280280	6283240	The lives of the innocent are the price of the war on Prime.
6283240	6284280	Yeah, but he's fucking-
6285160	6285880	Can't hear you.
6289320	6291000	Gave you the best years of my life.
6292920	6295000	If I listened to ghosts, I'd never get anything done.
6295960	6299640	If you didn't have a butler, you wouldn't get anything done.
6299640	6301080	I'd do all the fucking work.
6301080	6303880	Can't hear you over the sound of me avenging your death.
6304680	6307000	This Tony Stark makes all his own shit.
6308600	6309960	You have other people do that. You're like,
6309960	6311720	you're like the Trump of superheroes.
6315800	6316920	Ghost power.
6321400	6322360	Doom Namatron.
6322360	6325560	I know you know I'm here.
6325560	6326280	Yeah, what's up?
6329720	6330280	Who is it?
6332680	6333880	I'm Batman.
6333880	6334760	Yeah, I'm here.
6334760	6335640	Yeah, I don't know you.
6337160	6338520	I don't know Batman.
6338520	6339720	You've heard about me.
6339720	6340360	No, no.
6340360	6344120	Every time I beat up one of your friends, I say, tell all your friends about me.
6344120	6344440	Yeah.
6344440	6347320	I've crunched the numbers. I know it's gotten back to you.
6347320	6349880	No, no, no, let me. Okay, let me think about it a little bit.
6349880	6350920	No, you've heard of me.
6350920	6351640	No, let me think about it.
6352440	6355000	It's Batman. Don't high road me.
6355000	6358440	Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I think I heard you.
6358440	6361320	Yeah, oh, yeah, so aloof.
6361320	6362520	Doom Namatron, who's out?
6362520	6364520	Who are you talking to out there?
6364520	6366200	Some Batman.
6366200	6368120	We're watching TV in here.
6368120	6370200	And we're watching TV. We got no time for this.
6370200	6373720	Doom Namatron, you tell that Bat lady to go away.
6374360	6375800	Get away. I've got to go. Go back.
6376280	6381880	A well-placed gel spray shaped like a bat for no reason.
6386600	6390200	A few steps back, press the X key, I think.
6394600	6395480	Door open.
6395480	6398040	Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Shit.
6398040	6400200	God damn it. Shit. Shit.
6400200	6403160	Bat, bat, bat, narco, narcojets.
6403640	6406040	I didn't hurt your dog. I put him to sleep.
6406040	6407640	I mean, it made him go asleep.
6409640	6411320	Oh, hell no.
6411320	6412200	What the fuck?
6412200	6413400	Oh, hell no.
6413400	6415400	What the fuck did you do to ladybug?
6415400	6416440	I put him to sleep like...
6416440	6418280	What did you do to ladybug?
6418280	6419720	What did you do to ladybug?
6419720	6421080	You should have opened the door.
6421080	6422440	Why did you do that to ladybug?
6422440	6423880	You should have opened the door.
6423880	6425240	We had him for 13 years.
6425240	6426520	Why did you do that to ladybug?
6426520	6428040	Keep your hands where I can see them.
6428040	6429240	Stop reading.
6429240	6430440	I'm not going to read.
6430440	6431640	I'm not going to read.
6432600	6433960	Stop resisting.
6433960	6435480	Why did you do that to ladybug?
6435480	6437320	Keep your hands where I can see them.
6439320	6440600	I'm putting this on Vine.
6442280	6443080	Put down the gun.
6443880	6445560	Bat, bat, bat, bat, bat.
6446760	6448120	Bat shaped batarangs.
6448120	6448920	Bat, bat, bat.
6451640	6451880	Loop.
6455160	6456200	I boomeranged it.
6457720	6458840	It was Instagram.
6461640	6464360	I shot batarangs at you.
6464360	6464860	Right.
6466440	6467400	I'm not denying it.
6469080	6470280	You killed my dog.
6472200	6473080	You're under arrest.
6474840	6476760	For what?
6479000	6480760	I don't see no badge either.
6481400	6484760	You're dressed up like a devil, man.
6484760	6487880	9-1-1, some crazy underoos walked in here right now.
6487880	6489000	I just killed ladybug.
6490040	6491400	Just put the phone down.
6491480	6492360	I'm a batman.
6493560	6496600	He's wearing more than a t-shirt and briefs.
6497240	6499560	So I would not call him an underoos.
6499560	6502120	He looks like a underoos Beyonce.
6502120	6505240	No, you're going to confuse him
6505240	6509480	because he's wearing more than just a t-shirt and briefs.
6510440	6513080	It would be confusing to call him underoos.
6514120	6515000	Don't do that.
6515000	6516600	Don't confuse the police.
6516600	6518760	They got plenty of things to do.
6518760	6520520	Meanwhile, back at Tron's house.
6522280	6522940	Hey!
6522940	6525000	Do you want to ride light bikes around?
6525000	6525500	Hey!
6526040	6526540	Hey!
6527480	6529160	Where's the orange slices?
6529160	6530760	Who are you talking to, man?
6530760	6531240	What?
6531240	6532280	Who are you talking to?
6532920	6535480	The person I'm talking and yelling at.
6535480	6536600	I'm right next to you.
6536600	6538280	Okay, where are the orange slices?
6538280	6539080	They're in the fridge.
6539080	6540520	We're standing right in front of them.
6541640	6542840	That's why I like you.
6545080	6547400	Can I have some orange slices?
6547400	6548200	Yeah, man.
6548200	6548680	Oh, good.
6551880	6554280	Hey, don't answer that.
6554920	6556520	Oh, I already did.
6556520	6557160	Hello?
6557160	6557640	Sorry.
6557640	6558840	It's disrespectful.
6558840	6559340	Hello?
6560040	6560920	Hey, it's Batman.
6561880	6563480	Listen, I got a bit of a situation.
6564520	6565480	Do you have any...
6565480	6567240	Don't bogart the orange slices.
6568440	6568940	Hello?
6570280	6570780	Hey.
6571400	6571960	Are you there?
6571960	6574040	We leave a message at the tone.
6574040	6574680	What are you doing?
6574680	6575160	What the fuck?
6577320	6577800	Hello?
6577800	6580360	I did the tone before I did the...
6580360	6581160	Well, it's Batman.
6581160	6582360	It doesn't make sense.
6582360	6584280	I don't think you hung up the phone.
6584280	6585160	I can hear people.
6587400	6588360	It's Batman.
6588360	6589480	Do you have a fish tank?
6590680	6591080	Yes.
6591080	6591640	Why would I?
6591640	6592440	Hey, Batman.
6592440	6593240	It's me, Alfred.
6593240	6594040	I'm hanging out.
6594040	6596680	I'm hanging out with the ghost of that dog you just killed.
6598600	6600040	He just kicked my fish.
6601160	6603160	Everybody you killed, we're all hanging out up here,
6603160	6604120	having a good old time.
6605000	6605960	Is that a ghost?
6607800	6608840	I gotta get justice.
6609720	6610360	Hanging up.
6611160	6614440	Hanging up.
6614440	6615320	Tube Namatron.
6617720	6618220	Yes?
6619880	6620600	I'm sorry.
6621880	6622680	I'm sorry I...
6623800	6625080	I'm sorry I transgressed.
6626360	6627240	I made a mistake.
6627880	6629240	I put myself above the law.
6629880	6631000	I feel bad.
6632040	6633800	I acknowledge I did that.
6633800	6635880	I'm going to think better of it in the future.
6637480	6638040	I'm leaving.
6639240	6639880	Bat.
6639880	6640680	Bat.
6640680	6641480	Bat.
6641480	6642280	Bat.
6642280	6643000	Bat.
6643000	6643480	Bat.
6647320	6647880	Who was that?
6650120	6650840	Oh, thanks, kid.
6652600	6654760	He's Hispanic, though.
6658120	6660360	Oh, I mean, that's innocent.
6661400	6663560	People I protect can't do anything for me.
6663560	6664840	It's my job to do something for them.
6666360	6668840	It's just not powerful enough.
6669560	6670520	Only rich enough.
6672360	6677880	If I just turn around backwards and fall backwards,
6677880	6680360	spreading my arms in a bat shape.
6688520	6689320	What is he doing?
6691320	6692920	Is this like the end of Birdman?
6692920	6693400	It's weird.
6693800	6697800	Oh, god damn it.
6697800	6701000	The cape is designed to automatically make me land like a hero.
6702360	6703640	I thought I would kill myself.
6703640	6705320	It's weird to see him during the day.
6705320	6705800	I know.
6705800	6706360	It's weird.
6706360	6708280	It's like 330.
6708280	6708760	I thought it was...
6710440	6710920	Ladies.
6711640	6712280	It's weird.
6712280	6712920	It's weird.
6712920	6714120	Hey, what is he doing?
6714120	6715160	He's just right here.
6715160	6715640	He's weird.
6715640	6716360	It's weird.
6716360	6717000	Hey, hey, hey.
6717000	6717960	I can hear you.
6717960	6718760	Yeah.
6718760	6720360	We're picking up our children from school.
6721320	6723960	And Bruce Wayne.
6727240	6728120	Fucking Bruce Wayne.
6728840	6730520	I live in the biggest house in the city.
6731160	6735160	I'm the guy that has equipment approximating Batman.
6735160	6737640	So this whole time, we just thought you were like an underdog hero,
6737640	6738680	but you're just a rich person?
6740760	6741240	Yeah.
6741240	6744680	Yeah, I wasn't a poor person with fucking military equipment.
6745640	6747000	I was a rich person.
6747880	6748280	Yeah.
6748280	6752280	Why didn't you give all that money to the police force or the poor?
6752280	6754280	Because corruption lies in every darkness.
6754280	6754760	Snap.
6755320	6755880	Oh, fuck.
6755880	6756760	I snapped her neck.
6756760	6757800	Oh, fuck.
6760200	6760680	Mace.
6761400	6761880	Mace.
6763480	6764680	Anti-Bat Mace.
6766760	6769240	Well, maybe you don't recognize me, Batman.
6769240	6770200	Snake King.
6773880	6774520	Sorry.
6774520	6775080	Yes.
6779720	6780440	Nice to meet you.
6781800	6783640	I didn't even have an S on the end of it.
6783640	6786040	I added a gratuitous S.
6786040	6790760	The villain is so reptilian that words without S is still...
6791880	6795640	I was bitten by a radioactive spider and turned into a snake.
6797080	6798280	What did you base that out?
6798280	6798840	I don't know.
6798840	6799880	It's all fucked up.
6801000	6801240	What?
6801240	6802360	Can you climb walls?
6802520	6805160	Well, I can kind of go up trees.
6805160	6806680	Are you sure you're not a spider?
6806680	6810840	Are you sure you don't have spider powers and you just mistakenly decided to opt for a snake?
6810840	6811240	I don't know.
6811240	6812200	I'm pretty...
6812200	6813080	I slither about.
6813080	6813720	I kind of go...
6813720	6815240	You still define slither.
6815240	6816200	I go around.
6816200	6817000	I go up a tree.
6817000	6817640	Watch this.
6817640	6818840	A spider can do that.
6818840	6821640	But yeah, but they walk up a tree.
6821640	6822120	Watch this.
6823080	6825240	But you're a human being going like this up a tree.
6825240	6826280	That's a spider can do that.
6826280	6827160	Yeah, you're not a bat.
6829400	6830920	I didn't get bit by anything.
6831800	6833560	I was just taking the shit out of you.
6833560	6834440	I was fucking around.
6834440	6835400	I don't know.
6835400	6836600	You're just a crazy guy.
6836600	6837400	I'm not a snake.
6838360	6838840	Kyle?
6841560	6842600	How did you recognize me?
6843800	6844600	You're Tude.
6848520	6852040	You're the only guy that gave me the business in high school.
6852040	6854040	I've been following you around for your entire career.
6854920	6856040	You knew I was Batman.
6856600	6858520	Every time you saw a shadow that wasn't yours,
6858520	6861160	it was one of those shadows that was mine.
6867880	6868520	They call me...
6869640	6870360	Hot farts.
6873880	6875240	Do you guys mind if I just-
6875240	6875960	Hot farts, away!
6877480	6878600	Shit.
6878600	6879080	What?
6879080	6879320	What?
6880360	6881000	I just...
6881000	6881720	It's my car.
6881720	6882600	I got to pull out.
6882600	6883080	You guys are...
6885880	6887160	I'll be real quick.
6887160	6887960	I'm just gonna go.
6888440	6889960	I'm getting late, you know.
6891080	6892040	You can continue this-
6892600	6894120	I can continue what?
6894120	6895000	My friend left.
6896040	6898760	You can continue standing there after-
6898760	6899960	Oh, can I?
6899960	6901080	How about I take your car?
6902840	6904360	How about I take your fucking car?
6905240	6906200	You know what I think?
6906200	6907240	I think you're a criminal.
6908200	6909560	I'm a vigilante.
6909560	6910840	I think you're a criminal.
6910840	6911480	Step back.
6911480	6912360	Step the fuck back!
6913000	6914120	I'm taking your car.
6914120	6914920	Give me the keys!
6914920	6918040	I'll use bad equipment to-
6918040	6918440	Give me the-
6919320	6921000	If you're lucky, I'll leave it somewhere.
6924920	6925480	Where is the-
6925480	6926520	How do you fucking-
6926520	6927160	What is this?
6927160	6928280	You don't have to put the key-
6928280	6929000	Don't fucking-
6929000	6931080	Don't put your fingers out of my face!
6931080	6932120	Press the button, you don't-
6932120	6933560	There's no fucking dick.
6934520	6935480	Just press the button.
6936200	6936840	You don't have to put the key-
6936840	6937720	Fucking button?
6937720	6938440	What?
6938440	6939240	Pick a lane.
6939240	6941160	Is it a Batmobile or a car?
6941160	6942520	It's my car.
6942520	6944120	It's not a Batmobile.
6944760	6946840	Why is there a key if there's a power button?
6947480	6948760	What the fuck are you people-
6948760	6950280	I'm not Henry Ford, motherfucker.
6950280	6951640	Just press the button or get-
6953720	6954840	It's not making a sound.
6954840	6955800	Can I move now?
6955800	6956840	Is it like a golf cart?
6957960	6960600	Maybe you should steal someone else's car.
6961400	6962440	I'm taking this.
6962440	6963400	God damn it.
6963400	6963960	Taking this.
6964520	6964920	Watch it.
6964920	6965560	You're gonna hit-
6965560	6966280	Just shut up!
6967480	6968680	You're gonna hit the mailbox!
6968680	6969560	I can't hear you!
6969560	6970520	I'm a block away!
6970520	6971480	I'm a block away!
6975080	6976520	It's just too really loud.
6979400	6980600	Are you fucking kidding me?
6984440	6984920	Shit.
6985480	6986200	Hey, it's me.
6986200	6987320	I was an undercover cop.
6989880	6995480	Cliffhanger!
6996120	6996440	Yeah.
6997080	6998600	Well, if you didn't have fun-
7000600	7001480	That's not our fault.
7004440	7006280	Let's hear it for Rob Schwab, everybody.
7010840	7012280	Steve Levy, who made an appearance.
7012280	7013160	Spencer Crichton and-
7015000	7015480	Ben-
7017640	7019080	Go check with the car there.
7019080	7019880	Guns don't lie.
7019880	7020760	Find that guy's movie.
7020760	7021720	Pay for it.
7021720	7023560	Help him make that awesome Western.
7023560	7024680	I'm Jeff Davis.
7024680	7025800	You're Mayor Dan Herman!
7030120	7031640	Hard for-
7034120	7034920	Did you get any of that?
7036360	7037800	It's a good show!
