0	13760	From Mountain View, California, for the first ever Idiot Fest, Harbontown is now in session.
13760	15720	Spencer Crittenden to the stage, everybody.
15720	16720	Spencer!
16720	43480	I'm not supposed to, I shouldn't be offended that these seats are empty, right?
43480	49120	Those are famous people's seats, it's just other famous people don't like me.
49120	51080	That's the Harbont guarantee, that's fine.
51080	52880	Those were empty for the other people, right?
52880	54380	No, that was full.
54380	55380	Okay.
55380	59000	Wait, did Portlandia fill these seats or were those empty too?
59000	60000	They were all full, weren't they?
60000	61000	They were full.
61000	62000	You know why?
62000	69080	Because crooked Fred Armisen makes promises to other famous people that I don't make.
69080	70080	I'm an outsider.
70080	76280	A lot of those people though were paid by Fred Armisen to be here, they were paid seat
76280	77280	fillers.
77280	84480	Crooked Fred Armisen and crazy Kerry Brownstein.
84480	89320	If you like her, you should hate him, if you like him, you should hate her, etc.
89320	98760	Comey's a leaker and I drained the swamp, the swamp is empty up there.
98760	102520	But thank you for coming, it's a nice sound, it's a hot day, you're walking around, you
102520	105080	come into a tent, what could be funnier?
105080	108960	Comedy works with high ceilings, outdoors.
108960	112200	You took a big chance and I want to make it pay off for you.
112200	115320	It's amazing, this is the first year this festival's going on, right?
115320	126040	Chris Hardwick is trying a new thing, he's a good guy.
126040	128360	You guys all know this, you're probably Chris Hardwick fans.
128360	133800	He's got that amount of niceness that brings out the badness in you when you're talking
133800	140080	to him, he makes you wonder what you could do to make him mad.
140080	146160	What if I ate a baby, would you frown, would that make you upset?
146160	151480	Evil people have that technique, you know you've been intoxicated with evil when you
151480	156320	start coming up with hypotheticals, you tell people, what if I ate a baby?
156320	161040	That's the only one I have.
161040	164480	Because we're in an outdoor tent right now, your hair is kind of blowing in an awesome
164480	172560	Stevie Nicks kind of rock and roll fashion.
172560	177760	You can tell from one syllable I was trying to do Stevie Nicks, and then I gave up, I
177760	183640	want to be Stevie Nicks, can't do it, can't do it no matter how you try.
183640	189680	I kind of got good at Roger Waters last night because I watched The Wall with Cody in the
189680	194960	hotel room because there's not a lot of places to keep out here, and we just stayed in the
194960	199800	hotel room and tried to find The Wall, Pink Floyd's The Wall, you millennials, you don't
199800	206200	know what maybe that is, like somebody's like, okay, all right, I misjudged you, but it's
206200	210720	hard to find The Wall, something happened, I think, by the way, how are you Spencer?
210720	211720	I'm good.
212720	218720	Spencer Crittenden, everybody, he came out here.
218720	220720	You're too kind.
220720	227040	But do you guys think Roger Waters, who, it's like the mastermind behind The Wall, so remember
227040	231720	The Wall that came out, and then you're like, when I was a kid, it was like, yeah, The Wall,
231720	236520	it's like education, and then when The Wall, the Berlin Wall was coming down, he did that
236520	241200	big concert, and it was like, it's relevant again, and then Cody was saying like, because
241200	245480	he just did a concert again, because now Trump is like saying, build a wall, and then
245480	250200	now he's doing, he's got a new album, and Cody's saying, no, you know Roger Waters is
250200	257160	stoked about Trump, I think that he's just like, time to get back out there, the smell
257160	265000	of grease paint, the limelight, cha-ching, all right, take that Roger Waters.
265000	269320	Wait, Dan, but you started off by saying that you are doing a pretty good Roger Waters impression
269320	270320	these days?
270440	278880	Well, now, because the acoustics in here probably won't sound like a good impression of you,
278880	283160	but I was thinking it would be funny if that song, you know, that starts with, I got a
283160	290320	little black book, my poem's in, got a bag, got a toothbrush, and a comb, that if the list
290320	294080	just kept going, and it wasn't relevant to anything, that he was just like, I got six
294080	301280	cowboy hats with ice cream inside two of them, and the third one has a frog with a
301280	302280	screwdriver.
302280	304800	So you're not going to do the impression for us?
304800	305800	No.
305800	310000	That's the thing, it's like, I can't, no, you have to be in an elevator with me or very
310000	315000	close with me in bed in order for the, to sound like, Roger Waters is, he wasn't somebody
315000	319920	that could have worked in like 1930s radio or at Woodstock or something, he's like, he's
319920	327240	an artist that's reliant on a certain layered, high-tech, high-fidelity thing.
327240	334640	So don't fucking, don't look at me like I'm less than talented, blame God for the speed
334640	337360	of sound and the laws of nature.
337360	341480	There's a place in my shower, if I get right into a corner in my shower, at a certain place,
341480	348760	a certain distance from the corner of my shower, I can sound exactly like a cello.
348760	352480	It sounds exactly like a cello, but I can't do it anywhere else, it sounds like me humming
352480	353480	like an asshole.
353480	356360	Spencer, do you ever sing in the shower?
356360	359560	Yeah, I sing in the shower.
359560	360560	You sing anywhere else?
360560	361560	You sing in a car?
361560	364960	Yeah, I really let loose in my car.
364960	369480	If there was a camera in my car, I'd be in prison, I think.
369480	374280	I just scream, like, just scream onomatopoietic sounds.
374280	377720	By the way, where the fuck are we?
378680	382520	That's not to offend you guys, that's my own ignorance.
382520	384520	We get in a plane, we flew for an hour.
384520	385880	We're in Mountain View, California.
385880	386880	What is that?
386880	387880	Where did we go?
387880	397480	It's where the white people live.
397480	398480	Hawaiian people?
398480	402360	The white people.
402360	407160	We went to a restaurant, there's a weird contradiction here, I think because it's a college town,
407160	413960	that's also a place where white people go to die, or invent things that make everyone
413960	416600	else live, which kills them.
416600	420280	I'll tell you what, they invented the iPhone 7, which I can't plug into the goddamn jack
420280	421280	here.
421280	432360	Yeah, because there's a strip mall near our hotel that's the size of fucking Babylon,
432360	435480	which was famous for its size.
435480	441200	I'm just saying, it's just endless, endless, and every single store is some place where
441200	446680	you can buy a thousand dollar pants or a plate you can't eat off of, but then in between
446680	452720	every third one is a restaurant, but it's like corn dogs, that's it.
452720	456960	It's like shitty restaurants where you order at the counter, and there's shit on the table,
456960	462040	and there's just a 16 year old going, I don't want to make you food.
462040	463040	What's with you people?
463040	465040	Pick a lane.
465600	468800	Are you rich, or are you going to kill yourselves?
468800	472800	Dan, it sounds like you're describing a mall, you went into a mall.
472800	479760	I guess I haven't been in a mall in a long time, that's what it is, it's not your fault.
479760	487800	There's a mall in your town, and I blame you for it.
487800	493920	We went into a place, and the young lady that was at the hostess counter, when we went
493920	504200	in she said, I don't ... Roger Waters.
504200	509320	The weird thing is, if she in any way has a disability, then this is a terrible thing
509320	511720	to do, is to imitate her voice.
511720	514480	I say you roll those dice, Dan.
515440	519520	It would be in her head, so I guess the idea is you're never supposed to make fun of anybody
519520	522560	or imitate them, because you might ... But then what?
522560	524440	Then what do we do?
524440	526320	What if you found out Trump was disabled?
526320	527320	He is!
527320	532880	He's a terrible president, he can't even- Did you hear the news?
532880	536760	What if they diagnosed that, and then every time you went, Comey's a leaker, and then
536760	541760	you're like, that's the equivalent of going, eh, what are we supposed to do?
541760	543340	The answer is just be bad people.
543340	546860	This is our invitation, there's a horrible man in the White House, you just be a troll
546860	547860	now.
547860	550700	So anyways, this bitch at this restaurant, fuck her!
550700	552700	Here's how she talked.
552700	559340	But I'm just saying, she did this thing, it was a Seinfeld low talker thing, we couldn't
559340	566860	understand her, there's this weird loud music playing, and she kept going like ... And then
566860	574220	we just leaned in, and until that one syllable became stuff, and when you leaned in enough,
574220	582100	you zoomed in on the wavelengths, and so you could hear and enhance, like, we're kind of
582100	588740	crowded, so you can sit, and you can order right away, but the kitchen's backed up, so
588740	591580	the food might take long.
591580	595740	That's every- You can't just say that.
595740	599380	That's every restaurant's disclaimer.
599380	602340	That doesn't make any sense, we can't compare that to anything, I don't know how fast- By
602340	606980	the way, we ordered the food, and it came out right away, so they're like the fastest
606980	610780	restaurant in the world, but, hey, you should know, there's something.
610780	616420	And there was a picture on the wall of Steve Jobs, it was like a portrait, the famous portrait
616420	623020	of Steve Jobs stroking his chin hairs, but he was flipping a middle finger.
623020	626540	And I was like, to me?
626540	627540	To society?
627540	628540	What?
628540	632100	I don't- Do you hate the guy?
632100	637980	The waiter swiped my credit card on an iPhone, but the thing was Steve Jobs flipping me the
637980	638980	finger.
638980	642820	Was that him trying to like outdo Einstein's picture of him sticking his tongue out?
642820	644300	He's like, I'm going to fucking- But what does that even mean?
644300	646460	I don't- I'm going to update this shit, motherfuckers.
646460	652060	Yeah, I don't know, I'm not going to say do you love him or hate him, I'll get some weird
652060	656460	biased opinion from 500 people in a tent.
656460	659980	Maybe you all hate Steve Jobs because he didn't give you a kidney, I don't know.
659980	662500	I'll never get the truth, who made that art?
662500	666440	Some guy that wanted clicks, and then some restaurant person hung it on a wall who has
666440	670940	no sense of time, doesn't know when their restaurant's fast, put their niece in charge.
670940	674740	Ugh, we're slow today, ugh.
674740	677980	Fuck your city.
677980	681500	I've seen all I can see.
681580	685420	I know everything about your people, I pronounce you terrible.
685420	693180	I've had a very- Well, now you seem interesting.
693180	697380	The only negative experience I've had since I was here, I was walking down University
697380	702380	Street Avenue, whatever that is, where all the kind of bougie restaurants are, and I
702380	708820	was walking down the road, like looking for a bar to have a drinking on a Sunday morning,
709820	712620	but it was all people having brunch, and there was screaming kids, so I couldn't hang with
712620	716820	that, and then there was one bar that was too bro-y, and it kind of smelled like last
716820	720100	night's body odor, and I couldn't dig that, and I'm walking down the road, and there's
720100	724780	this really good-looking young gal in tight jeans, and I look, okay, what's she going
724780	726380	to stop me for?
726380	730380	She's standing outside of a shop, and has anybody ever experienced the makeup people
730380	732820	that stand out there and fucking stop you?
732820	733820	Anybody?
734820	739060	Because I met some of the people who, they crossed the street around that place, and
739060	741820	this really good-looking gal, she goes, oh, you want a sample?
741820	742820	You shave?
742820	743820	You want some aftershave lotion?
743820	744820	It's really good.
744820	745820	I go, okay, cool.
745820	746820	Thank you.
746820	747820	Wait, wait, wait.
747820	748820	Come here.
748820	749820	I have something else that's really, really good.
749820	750820	I'm like, okay.
750820	751820	And she goes, wait.
751820	752820	Come inside.
752820	753820	Like, oh, gosh.
753820	754820	It's stuff like, what do you use for your skin?
754820	755820	I'm like, I gotta go.
755820	759100	And she's like, oh, come in, and she sits me down, and she puts some shit, like some
759100	767180	collagen stuff, it cleans off my eye, like some foamy, like cleanser, I presume.
767180	770660	And she cleans my eye, and she puts some shit on my face, and then takes like a folder
770660	775260	and starts fanning it, and it feels like there's cement on my eyeball.
775260	778940	And then he only puts it on one eye, and then she goes, okay, now put your hand over your
778940	779940	eye.
779940	783340	And she holds a mirror up to me to show me how, it's like, look at the bags under your
783340	784340	other eye.
784340	786460	Look how shitty this eye looks over here.
786460	788460	Like, do you feel this one tightening up?
788460	789460	Keep your hand there.
789460	790940	Keep your hand on the one that's tightening up and being good.
790940	796420	Do you feel how, look at how shit you look over here, you fucking, you 43-year-old alcoholic,
796420	798780	you look like shit over here.
798780	802580	And then he goes, now, now take your hand off.
802580	808820	You see, there was no fucking difference, except this side of my face felt like there
808820	814380	was plaster on it, and this side felt fine, and I still looked like I stayed up too late
814380	816260	last night and had a million beers.
817080	819620	Yeah, well, some people have had their health care taken away.
819620	822780	Anyways, this fucking guy.
822780	827740	Oh, hell no.
827740	829540	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, high road.
829540	831680	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, high road.
831680	838540	Ah-ah-ah-ah, do not take the low road, low road is off limits, high road, dance limits.
838540	845660	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, that's what's gonna be in this tent an hour from now.
845660	850060	They have the lights, they have the equipment, they are ready to go.
850060	854540	We are in the way of a fucking EDM revolution.
854540	858420	These chairs are obstructionists.
858420	861300	You are gonna be happy when I'm gone.
861300	866140	That's my 44-year-old impression of whatever EDM is.
866140	869900	That's your prom night, you fucking old piece of shit.
869900	873940	Do we have the capabilities, tech people back there, to get some EDM lights going from the
873940	874940	EDM tent?
874940	879500	Do an EDM check, let's just make sure it's ready.
879500	881740	Like do you have beats you can put on?
881740	882900	Ah-ah-ah-ah, what?
882900	888200	Ah-ah-ah-ah, no new taxes.
888200	894660	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, call me, call me, call me's a leaker.
894660	900540	Someone's got a tambourine, it's like a tribal thing in here now.
900540	902780	You brought a fucking tambourine to the show.
903780	905780	Oh, it's got lights on it.
905780	906780	Wow.
906780	913540	Oh, it's like an MDMA tambourine, it's got blinking lights on it.
913540	917700	The people around him are like, please kill yourself.
917700	921580	The people around him are gonna kill themselves at his cult meeting six months from now.
921580	922580	Fantastic.
922580	926660	He's a charismatic tambourine, glowing tambourine guy.
926660	929180	Be honest, are you on Molly or anything right now?
929180	930700	A little bit?
930700	932100	A tiny bit?
932100	936940	Are you coming down off last night?
936940	942100	Are you criss-crossing with Molly and something else?
942100	946940	The tambourine doesn't lie.
946940	951220	Who's on something that would make them freak out if I started talking directly to them?
951220	957700	Hands run up and like, I'm on something but don't want to discuss it on stage with you.
957700	962060	You're doing what I do when you're high, you just covered your mouth, you're like.
962060	965700	Who here right now is holding felonious amounts of class A narcotics?
965700	972140	I would like to come up and discuss that with us in front of the police.
972140	973740	Now we don't want anybody up here.
973740	978860	Look at that, there's a microphone in the middle, they can ask their, they're drawing
978860	979860	season three.
979860	982860	Have you ever done Hermitage on?
982860	990340	In fact, by now they're done drawing it, it's sitting in a vault, it's, it's, try to go.
990340	993660	You keep saying that, I've been to the studio, they're just doing nothing over there.
993660	994660	Yeah, there's no one drawing.
994660	995900	Yes, because they're drawing it.
995900	998660	They don't give a shit about the show, they don't care about you.
998660	1000500	That's true, because they're drawing it.
1000500	1004900	We cared a long time ago, I feel like I can't, I go out on my Instagram, me getting my mail
1004900	1009540	and there's a spider in my mailbox and I'm like, that spider's scary and 15 dudes are
1009540	1012380	like, are like, yeah, this is what you're doing?
1012380	1013380	Make Rick and Morty.
1013380	1018260	And I'm like, I, I go to the studio, there's a big dry, there's a giant dry erase board
1018260	1021700	and it's just pictures of tits and dicks and balls.
1021700	1023780	That's what they're drawing over at Starbucks industry.
1023780	1028940	The people that are responsible for it taking this long finished working on it a long time
1028940	1029940	ago.
1029940	1034420	That's the beauty of being slow, shitty people that in the hand their work off to talented
1034420	1038460	fast people, they're, they're behind schedule, but it's, but I can't do anything about it.
1038460	1042260	Which country did you send it off to, to have draw, animated and drawn?
1042260	1045380	Canada, a little, a little sweat shop called Canada.
1046380	1060980	Boo indeed, my, my, your outsourcing job by American, that disgusting troll, Justin Trudeau.
1060980	1071100	What a grody autocrat leaping out of caves, uh, taking selfies with tourists, sexy, gross
1071100	1072100	monster.
1073100	1078820	I just want to cuddle him to death, frown and roll around with him in a big pool of
1078820	1079820	syrup.
1081180	1082780	Maple, maple syrup.
1082780	1084020	Is that what they make up there?
1084020	1085020	Maple syrup.
1085020	1094220	I'm going to make maple syrup up there because I'm a boot to come, that shouldn't get that
1094220	1098900	bigger reaction, but that's also, that's, whatever you, whatever makes you give that
1098900	1099900	bigger reaction is fine.
1100220	1102540	They were just happy that that bit was, had come to a close.
1102540	1105020	Yeah, they were like, okay, we recognize that you're doing comedy.
1105020	1106020	Good.
1106020	1107020	That's good.
1107020	1109820	That's like giving a cat peanut butter if it just kind of does something.
1109820	1114300	Hey, uh, tech guy out there with the, with the light panel or gal, who is it?
1114300	1115820	Who's doing the lights back there?
1115820	1116820	What's your name?
1116820	1121620	I'm nine non binary and my name is nothing.
1121620	1122620	Sorry.
1122620	1123620	I just, I just thought it'd be funny.
1123620	1125620	It was like tech tech guy or tech lady.
1125620	1129060	And then you're like, I wrote it that and you're like, um, it's stellar.
1130700	1131700	What's your name?
1131700	1132700	Carter.
1132700	1133700	Carter.
1133700	1136020	If Dan ever tells a joke, it totally bombs.
1136020	1143100	Just go right into EDM place, but I'm not telling you the signal that you guys are supposed
1143100	1144100	to laugh.
1144100	1149380	And this show is no Portlandia, but wait, what if I, what if I, what if I say something
1149380	1150380	that works?
1150380	1151380	Can't I get a celebration?
1151380	1152380	Okay.
1152380	1153380	Carter, we'll leave it to you.
1153380	1155780	If you want to celebrate it when something really good happens, or if you want to be
1155780	1164140	ironic when there's a real turd or if I say hit it, that too, that's another.
1164140	1168500	So keep your eyes peeled for all that.
1168500	1169500	Let's just test it right now.
1169500	1170500	Hit it.
1170500	1171500	All right.
1171500	1172500	That was good.
1172500	1173500	That was good.
1173500	1174500	That was just a test.
1174500	1175500	That was okay.
1175500	1176500	Okay.
1176500	1189900	All right, but I like, you're, you're ready to go.
1189900	1190900	Yeah.
1190900	1192340	I almost finished the word wicked.
1192340	1196940	That's how I was getting into it, but, but I was getting tired.
1196940	1197940	So it's good.
1197940	1198940	You stopped.
1198940	1203140	I'm going to be catching my breath for the next few measures.
1203140	1205140	Um, yeah.
1205140	1208960	So it's, uh, you're already out of breath from that for a second of dancing.
1208960	1209960	That's what I just said.
1209960	1213900	You can't shoot me through a hole I shot.
1213900	1215400	It's called self-deprecation.
1215400	1219700	It makes me invincible.
1219700	1223420	Everyone on the internet with the fucking, I'll hit you where you just hate yourself.
1223420	1225620	I hit myself there.
1225620	1226980	I said, I'm fat.
1226980	1227980	I said it already.
1227980	1231180	I'm not fat anymore.
1231180	1232180	You can't make me fat.
1232180	1233180	I said, I'm fat.
1234180	1243820	It's just a big crowd of fat people over there, a bus from a camp that they, let's go see
1243820	1244820	our hero.
1244820	1254460	And then now I fucked that up mountain view.
1254460	1260060	So most of you guys are and ladies and, and, and, and anything are, uh, you're going to
1260060	1261060	your, are you students?
1261060	1263060	Is that it's a college town, right?
1263940	1264940	Okay.
1264940	1267940	So it's like, let me keep walking through guesses.
1267940	1270900	It's like, it's like Woodstock.
1270900	1274500	There's nothing normally here, but we all decided to come here.
1274500	1275500	Okay.
1275500	1276500	Got it.
1276500	1277900	I don't know what my third guess was.
1277900	1281660	Uh, it's a weird eyes wide shut, cold, cold.
1281660	1284660	I can't speak.
1284660	1285660	Okay.
1285660	1286660	Fidelio.
1286660	1287660	Fidelio.
1287660	1288660	But the eye is a one.
1288660	1290540	You have to watch the movie.
1290540	1295140	That's the password that Tom Cruise uses to get into the sex party.
1295140	1302620	Do you guys think that Hollywood is controlled by an elite, uh, cabal of pedophiles?
1302620	1305900	Because there was an article where Nicole Kidman said that Stanley Kubrick told her
1305900	1306900	that was the case.
1306900	1309820	And then she like now she's catching some flack for that.
1309820	1315180	There was recently a big thing about like British pedophiles up in high, high government.
1315180	1316180	That was a real thing.
1316180	1317980	And we kind of like, yeah, that was a weird thing.
1317980	1318980	Yeah.
1318980	1322740	And if predictive pedophiles controlled the world, that story wouldn't be huge.
1322740	1326900	And it wasn't.
1326900	1328140	So you're a believer.
1328140	1330180	Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.
1330180	1333300	No, no, I think it, I am.
1333300	1334540	I think it could be real.
1334540	1337820	It's really crazy, but it's weird to talk about it without seeming insane.
1337820	1342780	It's weird that you can't talk about it because you'll either be a target of a secret, secret
1342780	1348340	cabal of pedophiles or in your enthusiasm for explaining to people that it's possible,
1348340	1351780	you'll come off like a pedophile because you'll be like, think about it.
1351780	1353180	If you were rich, you'd fuck kids.
1353180	1357460	It's the first thing you do.
1357460	1360460	Hit it.
1360460	1363460	Hit it.
1363460	1364460	Pedophilia.
1364460	1367460	It's the, it's the, it's the mozzerati of sex.
1367460	1369780	Go to hell when you want to fuck a kid.
1369780	1370780	Go to get your neck.
1370780	1371780	Eat out a 12 year old.
1371780	1372780	Like a Ferrari going all the way.
1372780	1373780	I want to be a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
1373780	1382220	a 12 year old, like a, a Ferrari going all the way.
1382220	1392980	I want a yacht, but I don't want anyone over 13 today.
1392980	1394980	That one took a lot out of me.
1394980	1396980	Aerobically and spiritually.
1396980	1400380	I think we all lost a little part of ourselves in that one.
1400380	1401860	That was rough.
1401860	1406140	I lost two pounds and gained a horn.
1406140	1410540	I'm going to die and God will be fine with it.
1410540	1411540	I'm out of breath.
1411540	1413220	I got to get back on the elliptical.
1413220	1414220	Yeah.
1414220	1415220	I was so proud of myself.
1415220	1421140	I heard them cheering and I was like kicking and then my stomach was like, what do you
1421140	1422140	mean?
1422140	1427140	Like, like you got to stop.
1427140	1428140	I got to fuck more kids.
1428140	1429140	That's wrong.
1429140	1430140	Every time they shoot, they fuck a kid.
1430140	1431140	When the bullets come out, you know what they did.
1431140	1432140	Black to the white.
1432140	1433140	Go to fuck a truck.
1433140	1434140	A 12 year old in Trump tower.
1434140	1435140	That's the meaning of power.
1435140	1436140	When you fuck a kid, you don't know what you did.
1436140	1437140	That's all he rhymes with.
1437140	1438140	I put on a bib with a little kid on it.
1438140	1439140	Time to fuck a kid.
1439140	1440140	I'm going to die.
1440140	1441140	I'm going to die.
1441140	1442140	I'm going to die.
1442140	1443140	I'm going to die.
1443140	1444140	I'm going to die.
1444140	1445140	I'm going to die.
1445140	1446140	I'm going to die.
1446140	1447140	I'm going to die.
1447140	1448140	I'm going to die.
1448140	1449140	I'm going to die.
1449420	1451900	I'm going to die.
1451900	1454900	I'm going to die.
1454900	1458900	I'm going to die.
1458900	1469520	Then, uh, the applause was getting less enthusiastic as the no roads made by the president.
1469520	1472540	I wasn't telling you to pump it up.
1472540	1477660	I was standing next to you saying we all feel that we don't want this to come.
1477660	1481460	We all feel that we don't want this to be a runner.
1481460	1482460	That's what I'm saying.
1482460	1486380	Your natural behavior is right and good.
1486380	1490300	I think that diminished applause, that slightly less applause, was kind of the feeling that
1490300	1491300	that was act two.
1491300	1495300	That was the empire strikes back of a trilogy.
1495300	1499420	The payoff will be in act three of your child's pedophilia of sex.
1499420	1505280	I got to tell you, in most pedophile-driven stories, act three is not that satisfying.
1505280	1512000	It's either someone escapes from a garage or it's told from the other side.
1512000	1520600	Dear idiot fest, here's why our sponsorship is being revoked.
1520600	1529800	Signed Microsoft, Pentium, Google, Monster Energy, and, of course, Red Bull.
1529800	1531960	Are all those storm troopers walking around?
1531960	1533680	Are they all cosplayers?
1534680	1539440	Some of them are real storm troopers.
1539440	1543160	I walked out, and the first thing I saw was like 14 storm troopers.
1543160	1545520	Are they like the waiters?
1545520	1547520	They look like...
1547520	1548520	Pardon?
1548520	1557200	It's like a union, like a fake union, and it's like, that's cool, that's cool, I like
1557200	1558200	that.
1558200	1565760	It's like Civil War reenactors, like, put them in that drawer in terms of sexual probability.
1565760	1571360	I know that sounds like a bully thing you say, they're not going to get laid because
1571360	1572360	they're nerds, whatever.
1572360	1574800	I mean, look at me, I'm out.
1574800	1581840	What else can we rate in terms of sexual probability?
1581840	1585880	Chances of reigning men, 20%, partly cloudy.
1585880	1593000	Anyways, that would be a smart thing for Trump to do, because he could just pretend
1593000	1597840	to be a Star Wars fan, and then he'd have this street cred with nerds, and then he'd
1597840	1603600	start dressing cops like storm troopers, and then you could really beat down the people
1603600	1606200	that would be the first to resist.
1606200	1610920	You could target high IQ people, and take their asthma inhalers away and step on their
1610920	1615240	faces, and then if anyone had a problem with it, Trump would be like, I don't get why these
1615240	1622240	people, such haters about Star Wars, like, I'm looking forward to the movies, I enjoy
1622240	1628320	it, give me a lot of pleasure, you know, and you'd have people behind you more.
1628320	1634640	Because he's really hurting, he's not going to do fine at all, we're all going to die.
1634640	1641040	We're all in the midst of dying, it's permission to have fun, if you're 25, I'm sorry, sorry
1641040	1648880	about the burning husk filled with water, good luck, growing gills and figuring out
1648880	1659720	a way to express yourself in coal, dust on the hammered flat surface that used to be
1659720	1672600	a radiator in your fucking weird horn cave, drilled into the side of a ruined skyscraper
1672600	1678760	by a robot pterodactyl, powered by coal.
1678760	1685600	My vision, fuck you Alan Moore, I have a vision too.
1685600	1688580	Anyone can do this.
1688580	1693860	It doesn't just have to be zeppelins, if it's a dystopia, maybe it's robot pterodactyls.
1693860	1696660	Thank you.
1696660	1701020	All right, let's get on with the show.
1701020	1702220	I say so, yeah.
1702220	1707140	Let's stop delaying things, that was all the cold open.
1707140	1716980	Idiot, yeah, but one of the eyes is a one, but you don't know which one, I don't know.
1716980	1720700	When you try to Google it, you write an idiot fast, nothing comes up, you've got to put
1720700	1722740	the 10 in there and it's all fucked up.
1722740	1726900	Maybe it's genius, I don't know, maybe, I don't know, he's Hardwick.
1726900	1731020	Where Hardwick says to go, I go, I go where Hardwick tells me to go.
1731020	1737420	You know, Idiot like that is like in Apple stores, when the customer is an idiot, you
1737420	1742980	might say they're having an ID10T error and it's a code name for they're an idiot.
1743980	1751580	You don't have to clap, it's just relevant, right?
1751580	1756620	How is that a clever code, oh, you say ID10T, if you say it in front of the customer, they
1756620	1757620	don't know.
1757620	1758620	Yeah.
1758620	1765420	I was in a back of a squad car once and the cop said to another cop, yeah, I got a DFW
1765420	1770220	and I said drunk fucking, wait, what was it, god damn it, it was a DFI, I think it was a
1770220	1774740	drunk fucking idiot and the cop was like, yeah, I cracked your code, you're not going
1774740	1776860	to use code.
1776860	1782740	It was like three letters that was it, I was just like, yeah, I know what I am, and you're
1782740	1789140	not going to offend me, what happens now, I change squad cars, quick wasting taxpayer
1789140	1791500	money, take me home!
1791500	1792500	I'm drunk!
1792500	1793500	Were you being arrested?
1793500	1799300	No, because I'm the fucking Teflon drunk, man, I saw the cop, I pulled over, got out
1799300	1805340	of the car, he came roaring up, what were you doing, not driving?
1805340	1806340	That's what counts.
1806340	1808820	And he said, oh yeah, where are you going?
1808820	1815180	I said, to a friend, or I said, I'm coming from a friend, and he said, what's your friend?
1815180	1818700	I said, Carl?
1818700	1820020	And he's like, where's Carl live?
1820020	1825840	I said, I don't know, I'm drunk, can't remember where Carl lives, I just know I wasn't driving
1825840	1826840	and I walked.
1826880	1831800	He said, what if I said, I saw you driving, I'd say, I don't know, I'm drunk, I just came
1831800	1835640	from Carl's, and he said, what if I went up to every one of these houses and knocked on
1835640	1841480	it and asked for Carl, I'd say, at that point, who's winning?
1841480	1846160	And he put me in the car, and then made me wait forever, and another cop came up and
1846160	1847160	said, what do you got?
1847160	1848160	A couple DFIs?
1848160	1854480	And I said, I know, I'm still drunk, still smarter than all of you, like it's not that
1854480	1859920	big a deal, I respect you because you can shoot people.
1859920	1865080	Not because you're smart, drive me home.
1865080	1868840	I'm sorry, I took this into an ugly place.
1868840	1877160	Yeah, we took a kind of a sad turn from pedophilia into that dark realm.
1877160	1880440	Remember the good old days of pedophile jokes, you guys?
1880440	1884040	Now there's a kid there, there's a kid, I can see there's kids everywhere.
1884040	1889200	I got that born identity kid vision.
1889200	1890640	Why is that, Dan?
1890640	1893680	Because I protect them.
1893680	1903800	Why do I know where every exit and child is?
1903800	1909520	This better not translate to any online medium.
1909520	1912080	It's all about context these days.
1912080	1915960	That's 442, I feel like we should maybe, do we?
1915960	1916960	Should we?
1916960	1917960	Up to you, baby.
1917960	1918960	Kind of.
1918960	1923080	Let me crunch some numbers for a second, I'm kind of famous for it, for my math skills.
1923080	1925000	That's like the 50 minute to go mark.
1925000	1926000	15?
1926000	1927000	5-0.
1927000	1928000	No.
1928000	1929000	40.
1929000	1930000	Okay.
1930000	1931000	Let's hash all this out.
1931000	1935280	Let's maybe, let's meet one person from the area.
1935280	1936280	Yeah.
1936280	1940160	I don't know how you get them.
1940160	1941160	What are you doing?
1941240	1943240	I'm turning up to the microphone.
1943240	1944240	Okay.
1944240	1945240	Let's meet you.
1945240	1946240	All right.
1946240	1947240	This is great.
1947240	1948240	Wait, wait.
1948240	1949240	Don't look behind you, sir.
1949240	1950240	Oh, they already voted.
1950240	1951240	Do not look behind you.
1951240	1952240	Whatever you do, do not turn around.
1952240	1953240	Wait, what is going on?
1953240	1954240	What is this, the DMV?
1954240	1955240	What the fuck is going on?
1955240	1956240	All right.
1956240	1957240	Speed round.
1957240	1958240	Yeah, what is that?
1958240	1959240	What is that?
1959240	1960240	What is that?
1960240	1961240	What is that?
1961240	1962240	What is that?
1962240	1963240	What is that?
1963240	1964240	What is that?
1964240	1965240	What is that?
1965240	1966240	What is that?
1966240	1967240	What is that?
1967240	1968240	What is that?
1968240	1969240	What is that?
1970240	1971240	Yeah.
1971240	1972240	Well, okay.
1972240	1973240	I mean, fine.
1973240	1974240	Let's create it.
1974240	1975240	All right.
1975240	1976240	What is your name?
1976240	1977240	My name is Chewie.
1977240	1978240	Chewie?
1978240	1979240	Welcome, Chewie.
1979240	1982680	So, first off, I want to say that Abed was the first character I've ever seen in anything
1982680	1984240	that connected directly to me.
1984240	1985240	All right.
1985240	1988240	And no one will ever shut down the Delta Cubes.
1988240	1989240	All right.
1989240	1990240	Oh, nice.
1990240	1991240	Wow, man.
1991240	1992240	The Delta Cubes.
1992240	1997560	So, Deep Vision and Jack was one of my favorite shows, and I only saw one episode of it.
1997560	2003040	I was wondering if you feel like the timing, the cultural timing, was what made that not
2003040	2006760	work versus other things are doing now, or if there's some other?
2006760	2009160	Deep Vision and Jack, I don't think it was cultural timing.
2009160	2015960	Well, I guess maybe cultural, if you've got, yeah, it was, the audiences weren't fragmented
2015960	2021640	enough that one million people wanting to watch something meant cha-ching yet, which
2021640	2022640	it now does.
2022640	2025680	I mean, and I think a million people would have liked to watch Deep Vision and Jack because
2025680	2027800	it asked the question, what is television?
2027800	2031600	But back then, it was like, I think you need 20 million people to want to watch something
2031600	2033080	before somebody wants to make something.
2033080	2034080	It was a show.
2034080	2035080	It was about Jack Black on a talking motorcycle.
2035080	2036080	It was great.
2036080	2038800	It was a pilot, and they didn't pick it up.
2038800	2043080	They thought it would be expensive, and it was like, there were things before that, you're
2043080	2050680	just a baby, a sledgehammer, I'll say these words, you Google them, look well, a naked
2050680	2055560	gun or what was the police squad, what was the, like there's shows that kind of like
2055560	2059960	skew absurdity and stuff, and then it's like, oh, can I watch this or is this a sketch?
2059960	2063880	I think it was just that, and these days you could put something like Deep Vision and Jack
2063880	2065760	on sci-fi, maybe?
2065760	2066760	Too long an answer.
2066760	2067760	Thank you, Chewie.
2067760	2068760	Let's hear it for Chewie, everybody.
2068760	2069760	Yeah.
2069760	2070760	I didn't know we could go to Q&A.
2070760	2071760	It's great, though.
2071760	2072760	Here we go.
2072760	2073760	Oh, shit.
2073760	2076760	It's, it's, it's craft punk, actually.
2076760	2079560	It's, it's, it's, what, what?
2079560	2084000	It's from the Eric Andre show, it's called a craft punk, you like.
2084000	2087120	I think you can hear yourself in there.
2087120	2088440	It's called a craft punk.
2088440	2089440	Oh, okay.
2089440	2095000	Yeah, so it's like, you know, daft punk, but I throw cheese at people and feel like that.
2095000	2099400	But I, well, first off, I want to dance with you.
2099400	2105560	If we can do a dance off, that'd be cool, but, but, um, what do you got?
2106560	2112560	Oh, shit.
2112560	2124560	This is the most applause you've ever gotten.
2124560	2125560	He wins!
2125560	2126560	Dan is doing push-ups.
2126560	2128560	Dan, he did the worm, not push-ups.
2128560	2131560	He was doing the worm, I think.
2131560	2133560	I was kind of just like humping the ground, kind of.
2133560	2137560	I'm going to do the worm, Herman.
2137560	2142560	It's, it's like it's take a little, take a little nap.
2144560	2146560	All right, Dan, let it go.
2146560	2147560	Let it go.
2147560	2148560	Thank you very much.
2148560	2149560	Thank you.
2149560	2150560	Whatever your name was.
2150560	2152560	It doesn't matter.
2152560	2153560	Call you Carl.
2153560	2154560	Hello, sir.
2154560	2155560	What's your name?
2155560	2160560	His second question was about world hunger.
2160560	2166560	Hi, I'm John, and I was wondering, this is a question for all three of you.
2166560	2171560	What guest at Harmon Quest would you ever want to join?
2171560	2173560	Who would be our favorite guest to have on Harmon Quest?
2173560	2175560	Yeah, that hasn't appeared yet.
2175560	2177560	Chris Hardwick!
2177560	2180560	Whoo!
2180560	2181560	There you go.
2181560	2186560	He asked, weren't we, weren't we talking about getting Dwayne The Rock Johnson on?
2186560	2190560	It was Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
2190560	2192560	Famous people are great.
2192560	2195560	They don't come to my show, but they're great.
2195560	2200560	Yes, old-timey root beer spokesmodel.
2200560	2205560	Having seen Harmon Quest, I know there's a lot of chaos to your creative process.
2205560	2210560	How much do you feel that fan theories influence where Rick and Morty goes?
2210560	2214560	Because some of those fan theories are really sophisticated, and you might not have met them,
2214560	2216560	but I bet you could run with them.
2216560	2221560	Well, I'm sure fan theories are just as good, if not better, of anything that we would come up with in a writer's room,
2221560	2230560	but I don't personally go to those forums since Community because I don't want to be influenced.
2230560	2236560	It's sci-fi, so it's like higher stakes to let yourself be influenced by a theory, you know what I mean?
2236560	2240560	And also, to tell you the truth, I hope this doesn't spoil anything, but I know that Rick and Morty,
2240560	2243560	there's not going to be an underlying fucking... I don't know.
2243560	2249560	We have conversations in the room, and then one's canon's canon, but I'm not a person that would ever be like,
2249560	2254560	okay, from the beginning of the series, I've always got this thing that inside the back behind his ear.
2254560	2258560	If you look real close, there's an egg, and the egg means the whole show's a lie.
2258560	2265560	He's an old drunk guy that's smarter than everyone, and for some reason, he's incredibly selfish and wants to...
2265560	2267560	I mean, we'll figure it out as we go.
2268560	2273560	But I have seen... I did have...
2273560	2278560	When we sat down and started writing the show, I was like, should we have one of those just in case?
2278560	2280560	And Mike McMahon, one of the writers, was like, how about this one?
2280560	2283560	I was like, holy shit, that's amazing. Let's do that?
2283560	2287560	And then two years later, I could see people were like, what if this?
2287560	2289560	And I was like, fuck that. No.
2289560	2291560	No, if you can sit... shouldn't do that.
2291560	2295560	Audiences are a render farm of ideas. They have nothing to do but sit there and think.
2296560	2299560	So if your show is payoff based, you're fucking yourself. I think.
2299560	2304560	But I'm just an old Batman that just...
2304560	2307560	Stop staring at me like that!
2307560	2312560	Alright, thank you. We have time for a couple more. We can't do everybody, because we have some business to attend to.
2312560	2320560	When you guys do festivals, do you stick around and watch bands, or do you go straight to the hotel room for Minecraft?
2320560	2324560	It's funny you should ask that, sir. Because last night...
2324560	2333560	Because last night, the saddest text message of the world came from Jeff to all of us, because he went to Weezer and Spencer stayed at the hotel and played Minecraft.
2333560	2334560	Yeah.
2334560	2339560	Jeff sent us video and then said, have fun playing Minecraft. And it was sad.
2339560	2345560	Yeah, because Steve Levy, if you know Steve, he'll probably come up here in a little bit.
2345560	2353560	We went down to see OkGo, and the people here at the festival gave us nice tickets in the main amphitheater.
2353560	2356560	And we saw that, and we came backstage and had a drink.
2356560	2359560	You know, like, you know, Dimitri Martin's hanging out back there in Hardwick.
2359560	2363560	And we walked back out, and to get back to our seats, we have to walk by the front row.
2363560	2372560	And we walked by, and the security guard that is in front of the photograph pit, right in the front, happened to be a Who's Linus Anyway fan.
2372560	2376560	He's like, oh man, Jeff! He's like a stoner dude, he's super cool.
2376560	2382560	And he goes, oh, I'm a big fan, man. I said, cool, can we come in the photo pit?
2382560	2386560	And he's like, yeah! So we just watched the first three songs of Weezer, right in the front.
2386560	2391560	And we just took a bunch of photos and sent it to these assholes who were at home in the hotel playing Minecraft.
2391560	2398560	Well, wait, I mean, that's a cool story, but how can that match, like, I was in the overworld, and I went through an obsidian portal,
2398560	2404560	where there happened to be ghasts flying around and lava rocks everywhere, and I didn't know where I was going,
2404560	2410560	but then I found a blaze and have shot a fireball? I mean, you didn't get a fireball shot at you.
2410560	2411560	No, I didn't.
2411560	2414560	Oh my god, you guys, millions have been deprived of their health care.
2416560	2417560	Hit it!
2421560	2426560	The High Road Dance, everybody. Let's give it up for MC High Road.
2429560	2433560	When you take a low road, you won't get far.
2433560	2437560	Take the high road, tell people where you are.
2438560	2445560	Say, I'm bisexual. You hurt me in your contextual argument, because this is who I am.
2445560	2450560	Took the high road to the peanut butter and jam of the real conversation.
2450560	2453560	I fucked your mama all across the nation.
2460560	2461560	All right.
2462560	2468560	I didn't mean that bisexual people take the high road, that was a weird, I didn't, that was just...
2468560	2470560	What did you mean, Dan? What did you mean?
2470560	2471560	I don't know, I was rapping.
2471560	2476560	And then, so MC High Road just immediately starts fucking your mother, that's the high road deal?
2476560	2483560	No, I think MC High Road is like, has an ironic compulsion for the low road.
2484560	2489560	That's like, how old was old Dirty Bastard? We don't know, I mean, he was older than Wu Tang, but...
2490560	2491560	All right.
2492560	2497560	Dan, if you're gonna fuck any mothers tonight, will you mind fucking my mama?
2499560	2501560	Sir, I would be honored.
2502560	2505560	All right, we'll take one more question, then we're gonna play some D&D.
2507560	2511560	I just want to say, I listen to your guys' podcast every day that it comes on,
2511560	2518560	and I actually wanted to talk to Spencer and ask if you've seen the street that is your last name that's like, really close.
2519560	2524560	Maybe not this exact one, or maybe, yeah, because I've driven around Northern California a fair amount,
2524560	2529560	but I've seen a ton of streets, not even on purpose, they just drive by streets that are crittendent.
2529560	2530560	Perfect.
2530560	2533560	So, it happens, there's way too many of them, it's weird.
2533560	2536560	Well, it's here and it made me think, so...
2536560	2538560	Well, thank you so much, I'll check it out.
2538560	2542560	All right, thank you very much, Mr. Meeseeks is here, I think, everybody.
2543560	2550560	Oh, Jesus Christ, that is really, really alarming.
2550560	2554560	That is, for the podcast listener...
2554560	2556560	A lot of people...
2556560	2558560	There's gonna be a lot of nightmares...
2558560	2560560	Oh, no, there's more than 36.
2560560	2561560	Oh, no!
2561560	2564560	I know, I sold it myself, it's my first time.
2565560	2567560	However, I do have one question.
2567560	2569560	I have several questions for you.
2570560	2572560	Wait, go ahead.
2572560	2574560	I mean, I serve you, if you have a question...
2574560	2578560	No, no, I was just making a terrible joke, go ahead, please.
2578560	2582560	Well, if you tell a Meeseeks that you have a question, he's gonna stop things.
2582560	2584560	Existence is pain, what do you want?
2584560	2588560	I just wanna, just this is, you know, we didn't press the button.
2588560	2591560	You're going, you're barking up the wrong tree, dog.
2591560	2593560	This is bad nerdery.
2593560	2598560	Well, his task, someone might have pressed a button and said go out and learn everything about stuff.
2598560	2600560	We don't know. It could be one of those Meeseeks.
2600560	2602560	So I just wanna know.
2602560	2606560	Even though Jerry has been divorced and whatnot,
2606560	2610560	Season 3, some of us are still left around.
2610560	2613560	We need to know if his short game is gonna get any better.
2615560	2616560	See?
2616560	2619560	Is he gonna get a better short game?
2619560	2622560	Are you saying you're more of a stickler Meeseeks than the...
2622560	2625560	I have a very stickler Meeseeks, I wasn't even in the scene.
2626560	2630560	Yeah, no, I think eventually he could become a pervert.
2630560	2632560	This is follow through Meeseeks.
2632560	2634560	Follow through Meeseeks.
2634560	2636560	Yeah, no, I think he'll eventually become better.
2636560	2641560	But while he learns, go dip your Meeseeks feet in a river.
2641560	2644560	You know, like do like awakening stuff.
2646560	2648560	I don't know how much longer I can exist like this.
2648560	2651560	He better be Tiger Woods five years ago tomorrow.
2651560	2654560	It's a circular conversation at this point.
2654560	2656560	What are you saying? I can't control it.
2656560	2659560	I mean, you're not gonna make me disappear anyway, so thanks for helping.
2659560	2661560	Alright, well, goodbye.
2661560	2663560	Thank you, Mr. Meeseeks.
2667560	2670560	I wanna know what's in that fanny pack so bad.
2670560	2674560	Most Meeseeks conversations, costumes have like bigger head,
2674560	2677560	like they make the bigger head in the padding.
2677560	2680560	It's like a weird to make it, to let it be regular sized head
2680560	2683560	is like John Wayne Gacy's pointy clown makeup.
2683560	2686560	It's just a subtle but fundamental choice.
2686560	2690560	They have a Meeseeks with like a tiny head, and they're like, okay.
2690560	2691560	Alright, well.
2691560	2694560	The opposite of tiny heads, one of the biggest brains in the world.
2694560	2697560	Let's bring up Steve Levy to the stage, everybody.
2697560	2707560	Steve Levy.
2707560	2710560	Hey.
2710560	2712560	How's it going, everybody?
2712560	2713560	Thought, man.
2713560	2714560	Hi.
2714560	2715560	We had a pretty good night last night, didn't we?
2715560	2716560	We had a great night, yeah.
2716560	2718560	We totally partied down.
2718560	2719560	Yeah.
2719560	2720560	Yeah.
2720560	2721560	It was wonderful.
2721560	2722560	Lots of good music.
2722560	2723560	Yeah.
2723560	2724560	A lot of good times.
2724560	2725560	Yeah.
2725560	2726560	A lot of memories.
2726560	2727560	We'll do that.
2727560	2728560	We'll have for the rest of our lives, Steve.
2728560	2731560	It was a nice, harmonless night.
2731560	2732560	That's fine.
2732560	2733560	I don't care.
2733560	2735560	I watched The Wall with my girlfriend.
2735560	2737560	I had a great time.
2737560	2739560	Okay.
2739560	2742560	I don't get jealous of people anymore.
2742560	2743560	I don't care.
2743560	2745560	I have a perfect life.
2745560	2748560	You seem pretty mad about your restaurant experience today.
2748560	2750560	It's a bad restaurant.
2750560	2751560	I don't understand.
2751560	2753560	They also didn't have salt on the table.
2753560	2755560	I don't like restaurants that don't put salt on the table.
2755560	2756560	I feel judged by them.
2756560	2758560	Like, I have low blood pressure.
2758560	2759560	So judge someone else.
2759560	2764560	Like, if you serve hash browns at your restaurant, you don't put salt on the table.
2764560	2773560	What you're saying to me is, wait, it gets better.
2773560	2777560	Nothing makes you question what you're currently saying, like the vision of someone just walking
2777560	2778560	out.
2778560	2779560	You're like, wait, what am I doing?
2779560	2780560	What am I doing?
2780560	2781560	It doesn't matter.
2781560	2782560	They might have diarrhea.
2782560	2784560	They're not trying to send that signal.
2784560	2786560	But it makes you really think twice.
2786560	2787560	I think everyone...
2787560	2788560	But they walked out in a pair.
2788560	2791560	Do you think they both have diarrhea?
2791560	2794560	Everyone who's ever talking should always have to have an image of someone walking out
2794560	2796560	of a tent while they're talking.
2796560	2799560	It'll keep you on your toes.
2799560	2800560	All right.
2800560	2805560	So we're going to play our second round of our new campaign of Pathfinder, everybody.
2805560	2806560	Yeah.
2806560	2810560	Now, Levi, you weren't with us for the first... for the pilot episode.
2810560	2813560	I was not, but I certainly listened to it.
2813560	2816560	Yeah, we didn't get a lot done.
2816560	2819560	Did anybody here hear last week's D&D?
2819560	2820560	All right.
2820560	2821560	Not that many.
2821560	2823560	So Spencer, you're going to have to catch this up.
2823560	2827560	Not a lot happened, so you're kind of coming in pretty fresh.
2827560	2829560	You'll be easily caught up on this.
2829560	2830560	Right.
2830560	2832560	Spencer, do you want to lay out the intro for us?
2832560	2833560	What?
2833560	2834560	You want to give us the intro?
2834560	2835560	Sure.
2835560	2836560	Yeah.
2836560	2838560	Do you have character sheets for us?
2838560	2839560	Sure.
2839560	2840560	Yeah.
2840560	2844560	All right, I'll come grab those.
2844560	2850560	I think that, you know, one thing that's going to be tough, because we're going to have
2850560	2853560	to, like, make sure we hear each other.
2853560	2855560	It's a tent.
2855560	2858560	We're doing stuff that's going into canon, you know?
2858560	2859560	Yeah.
2859560	2860560	Rob or Carter, was it?
2860560	2863560	Is there a way to get a little bit more of our mics in the monitor so we can get each
2863560	2864560	other a bit more?
2864560	2866560	Check, check, check, one, two, two.
2866560	2867560	There we go.
2867560	2868560	Oh, yeah.
2868560	2869560	What if that results in feedback?
2869560	2871560	You know, they write a line back there.
2871560	2872560	Just don't point your mic at the monitor.
2872560	2875560	You've never been in a rock band?
2875560	2877560	No.
2877560	2880560	All right.
2880560	2882560	I'm just looking for my character sheet.
2882560	2884560	It's fine.
2884560	2886560	Who cares?
2886560	2888560	We're not doing anything.
2888560	2889560	A lot of people care.
2889560	2893560	Spencer, I'm going to give you the intro music and you're going to lay it on us, all right?
2893560	2894560	What?
2894560	2895560	He can't hear you.
2895560	2896560	Okay.
2896560	2897560	No, it's great.
2897560	2898560	All right.
2898560	2903560	You guys, last time a town was in peril and they dispatched the church.
2903560	2908160	That is to say, you guys, to help solve the problem.
2908160	2914080	Upon seeing a house, you immediately demanded entrance, pushed past the homeowners and went
2914080	2917560	upstairs to accost a child.
2917560	2919240	Bedridden.
2919240	2922560	You attacked the child and punched him in the face.
2922560	2925560	Luckily, it turned out he was possessed by a demon.
2925560	2931560	So it wasn't like entirely terrible, but it was bad news and a ghost came out.
2931560	2932560	Oh, boy.
2932560	2937440	The demon attacked and you guys didn't know what was going on and so you told the mom
2937440	2944440	to make some bad soup like Adam's family and then you left and then it was over.
2944440	2945440	That's all.
2945440	2948440	We're caught up.
2948440	2949440	Okay.
2950440	2956440	The most important thing that I don't have is my list of spells.
2956440	2957440	Yep.
2965440	2969440	I feel like you like it that I'm not prepared.
2969440	2970440	Yeah, it's great.
2970440	2972440	I'm really digging this.
2972440	2975440	Can't you go on our slack, Dan, and find your spells?
2975440	2976440	They're on there, aren't they?
2976440	2981440	I don't know if I have a list of my spells on the slack.
2981440	2984440	Players go, thank you, sir.
2984440	2985440	I'll try.
2985440	2993440	I mean, the other thing is that going on to slack will require me to shut off my iPad
2993440	2999440	and turn it back on so I can get on the AT&T fucking network.
2999440	3000440	Interesting.
3000440	3003440	How about if I just spend this adventure eating shit and die?
3003440	3007440	Yeah, you cannot cast spells or you can cast healing spells.
3007440	3008440	It'll be great.
3008440	3009440	Fine.
3009440	3010440	Let's worry about it.
3010440	3012440	So where are you guys?
3012440	3019440	You guys, you just left a house and Diarrhea Jr. is there.
3019440	3021440	Hey, guys.
3021440	3022440	Hey, DJ.
3022440	3023440	How's it going?
3023440	3024440	Good.
3024440	3032440	I finally caught up with you after you left me in the last village to clean up that mess you made.
3032440	3036440	Yeah, well, you know, we had the wagon and the horses, and, you know, and six o'clock means six o'clock.
3036440	3039440	You were late, and so we left without you.
3039440	3040440	All right.
3040440	3042440	Well, I'm here now.
3042440	3043440	Yeah.
3043440	3044440	What did I miss?
3044440	3054440	Well, Carlos punched a child that was in bed, and a ghost came out, but we didn't know how to get rid of the demon ghosts, so we left.
3054440	3058440	And we're going to go investigate these burned-out ruins over here, we think.
3058440	3059440	All right.
3059440	3060440	Let's do it.
3060440	3063440	Do you have any spells that you think could get a demon out of a child?
3063440	3065440	I'm just a fighter.
3065440	3066440	Okay.
3066440	3067440	Forget it, then.
3067440	3068440	All right.
3068440	3074440	So we're pretending that we knew you before we started the last one, or what did we...
3074440	3075440	You've known me.
3075440	3076440	Yeah.
3076440	3078440	You took me under your wing.
3078440	3081440	This is kind of unceremonious, this, like, reunion.
3081440	3083440	He was just late.
3083440	3085440	He didn't make the wagon time in time.
3085440	3088440	He was back taking care of another thing, and you and I went ahead.
3088440	3089440	Don't you remember?
3089440	3091440	You exclaimed, my work here is done.
3091440	3099440	And then everything was on fire, and I had to stay behind and just put out the fires, and you left.
3099440	3103440	So you're kind of like an assistant to me.
3103440	3106440	Whatever you won't think.
3106440	3108440	All right.
3108440	3109440	Yeah.
3109440	3111440	Hey, DJ, you're not his assistant.
3111440	3115440	You're a priest of the silver flame, just like he is, just like I am.
3115440	3117440	Don't let him talk to you like that.
3117440	3119440	I appreciate him.
3119440	3121440	He can say what he wants, you know?
3121440	3123440	I feel like he's walking all over you.
3123440	3124440	Okay.
3124440	3125440	I don't.
3125440	3132440	Well, let's go check out those ruins that were across from the street from the kid that I punched.
3132440	3140440	You walk over there, and you see the charred-burnt ruins of what looks like it was a barn and then a house.
3140440	3145440	There's only kind of the skeletal structure of blackened buildings.
3146440	3149440	I investigate the blackened charts.
3149440	3151440	Oh, man.
3151440	3153440	It looks like it was a recent fire.
3153440	3156440	There's ashes everywhere.
3156440	3162440	Do either of you have any magical ability to kind of find important things while my iPad boots?
3167440	3171440	I take out my magnifying lens.
3171440	3172440	Oh, shit.
3172440	3175440	Then examine the charring wood.
3175440	3181440	Examining the charring wood, you see that the floorboards don't line up perfectly.
3181440	3188440	Hidden among the ashes in the dust, there seems to be the outline of some sort of trap door or something.
3188440	3190440	It looks like there's a trap door.
3190440	3192440	Nicely done, Squire.
3192440	3195440	Thank you.
3195440	3197440	Let's examine it.
3197440	3200440	It's a trap door!
3200440	3207440	Can you pick up a chunk of burnt wood and throw it at the trap door to see if it springs any mechanism?
3207440	3209440	No, it doesn't. It just lands.
3209440	3214440	It hits as if it's a little hollow underneath it, but otherwise it just lands.
3214440	3221440	I go up to it, and I wipe off some of the charred dust ash away from it and try to lift up the door.
3221440	3223440	All right, you do that.
3223440	3225440	Inside, you see two charred corpses.
3225440	3226440	Ah!
3227440	3229440	Appropriate.
3230440	3235440	I investigate him to see if there's any identifying clothing or marks or anything like that.
3235440	3241440	Not really. They seem really heavily burned as if they perished in the blaze.
3241440	3243440	Do they look like humans?
3243440	3246440	Oh, yeah, they look like humans. Sorry.
3246440	3252440	This is really upsetting to me, so I take out my foldable shovel and start digging graves for them.
3252440	3256440	Okay, you do that. It takes a long time.
3256440	3261440	I just examine the corpses more. Like, were they wearing clothes? Are their clothes gone?
3261440	3269440	Their clothes are like kind of... You only see the barest remnants of it, but it seems like heavy, heavy-duty clothes like blue-collar clothing.
3269440	3275440	Can we tell if one is female and one is male? Because this might be James and his wife that they said burned the house down and left.
3275440	3279440	You can't really tell. The skeletons are too deformed by fire!
3279440	3282440	Is there anything else down there that is worth looking at?
3282440	3285440	I check out the rest of the trap area.
3285440	3289440	No, it just looks like the bodies are just kind of stowed underneath the house.
3289440	3295440	Ah, so I think somebody burned down this house and hid the corpses down here.
3295440	3297440	Whoa.
3298440	3305440	Wait, you think somebody burned down the house and then went back into the burned-down house and...
3305440	3306440	Yeah.
3306440	3308440	Whoa.
3308440	3311440	Or...
3311440	3318440	Another theory would be that someone came here to bully these people and they hid themselves in a place where they could be hidden.
3318440	3324440	And then because the people couldn't find them, they simply burned down the house and these people died with the fire.
3324440	3326440	Whoa.
3326440	3328440	That's a possibility.
3328440	3336440	Or they wanted to die together and they lit the house on fire and then locked the door and they just hugged and burned to death.
3336440	3340440	Diarrhea Jr., don't you have some kind of looking glass that you were using?
3340440	3341440	Oh, yeah.
3341440	3344440	Can you check their privates? Because they...
3344440	3345440	Whoa.
3345440	3346440	Whoa.
3346440	3350440	We're being told that we can't tell if it was a man and a woman, but I just feel like, can you look closer?
3350440	3352440	I'll do my best.
3352440	3355440	Can't you see, like, the size of the pelvis or something like that, you know?
3355440	3360440	I take out my magnifying lens and start to examine their groin areas.
3360440	3363440	They're all burnt up. It's all fucking burnt to death.
3363440	3365440	It's all fucking burnt to death.
3366440	3370440	You know, guys, I'm Chad the Fire Liker, but I don't like any... I don't like this at all.
3370440	3374440	I'm not Chad the Burnt Corpse Liker.
3374440	3376440	I move the corpses.
3376440	3377440	Where do you move them?
3377440	3379440	Out of the hole.
3379440	3380440	You do that!
3380440	3381440	I was...
3381440	3383440	Okay. Is there anything beneath them?
3383440	3392440	No, it just kind of looks like it was underneath the floorboards and then they kind of just put a new plank in there to make it look like it wasn't.
3392440	3395440	It seems like you guys didn't make it here on time.
3395440	3401440	I go out onto the... What kind of fucked up thing is that to say?
3401440	3407440	You know, you left the other town early and it's just really bumming me out.
3407440	3409440	Jesus Christ, you know...
3409440	3414440	We left when we got the call from our superiors to say to come here because bad things have happened.
3414440	3418440	I mean, if we got here and nothing had happened yet, we probably wouldn't have gotten that call.
3418440	3424440	And maybe if we don't dwell on who's to blame for what, we'll get to the next place faster.
3424440	3426440	Like, this is awful what you do to us.
3426440	3430440	Batman doesn't look up and see the bat suddenly and go, I'm sure everything's fine.
3430440	3439440	Let's just... I want to go out to the outer perimeter because I feel like if people are going to burn a house, they're going to do it from the outside after they've filled it with accelerant.
3439440	3441440	Like, they did it Waco.
3441440	3445440	Whoa.
3445440	3448440	Texas.
3449440	3466440	I just want to do a perimeter around the burnt house, like knowing where the house was if I was going to burn a house from the outside, that perimeter, and walk it and look for anything, foreign objects, anything.
3466440	3471440	It doesn't look like that. It looks like the outside wasn't as burned as the inside.
3471440	3472440	Oh, interesting.
3472440	3474440	So, burnt from the inside, guys.
3474440	3475440	Figured that out.
3475440	3479440	Do you think that it was magic or just regular fire?
3479440	3483440	Hard to say.
3483440	3487440	Do we see any tracks leading in any direction?
3487440	3491440	No.
3491440	3492440	No tracks.
3492440	3494440	How far outside of town are we?
3494440	3503440	You're on the edge of town. There's the towns and then there's the farmland, which is, you know, pretty large swaths of property, and then there's more kind of towny buildings.
3503440	3516440	If one of my skills is knowledge, parentheses, arcana, would that maybe qualify me to know the difference between arson and, like, maybe a magical started fire?
3516440	3519440	Yeah. You could tell it's a magically started fire.
3519440	3522440	Can I pinpoint where the magically started fire started?
3522440	3526440	From the inside. Like, the main room.
3526440	3529440	Can I go to that main room? Is that where the corpses were?
3529440	3539440	No, not exactly, but it's close. It's like the house was small and there's only one main room and it's kind of just a frame, like a structure, so there's not really rooms anymore.
3539440	3541440	So you're just kind of in the middle of it where you found it.
3541440	3545440	Well, I go to that spot just because I want to, you know, be thorough.
3545440	3548440	Ash, ash, ashes, burnt wood.
3548440	3555440	All right. Well, I say we get in our wagon, take the horses into town and go, I mean, like, there's clearly, there's something going on.
3555440	3561440	We got a possessed child across the street. We got clearly either a double homicide or a double suicide here.
3561440	3564440	Do we need to go back across the street to help a possessed child?
3564440	3567440	I think put a pin in him.
3567440	3570440	Whatever you say, boss.
3570440	3573440	Yeah. Let's get in the wagon and go into town.
3573440	3574440	What's up?
3574440	3576440	We're taking the wagon into the town.
3576440	3578440	Man, I really can't hear you.
3578440	3582440	OK, you do that. You take the wagon into the town. You enter.
3582440	3588440	It seems that there's a small hill and there's just like seven or eight buildings kind of situated around the hill.
3588440	3591440	Most of them just seem like little houses.
3591440	3597440	Yeah. And then there's a winding path that goes up a hill and towards a wooded area.
3597440	3603440	And right on the edge of the woods, you can see the stone church building.
3604440	3607440	Great. You should probably check in at the church.
3607440	3609440	Yes, definitely. Let's go to the church.
3609440	3613440	All right. At this point, it's late at night.
3613440	3614440	Sorry. Sorry.
3614440	3618440	The prairie is a stone monastery made of ancient bricks.
3618440	3622440	The masonry is impressive and expensive and the front door is old and weathered.
3622440	3626440	On the door, you can see cracks in the wood and nails poking through,
3626440	3629440	as if the door has been reinforced recently.
3629440	3634440	You can hear the sounds of snoring coming just from beyond the door.
3634440	3638440	So people have nailed themselves inside the church.
3638440	3639440	Yeah.
3639440	3643440	All right. I knock on the church door.
3643440	3645440	Hello? Who's there? Who's there?
3645440	3649440	No one should come in at this night. It's too late. Who's coming in?
3649440	3654440	Inquisitors! From the church of the Silver Flame.
3654440	3657440	We're here to rid your town of evil forces.
3657440	3660440	We'll prove it.
3660440	3664440	Hey, if I prove it, you're going to spend a long time re-nailing that door.
3664440	3666440	Why don't you just open it?
3666440	3669440	The big threat. I can't back up.
3670440	3672440	He doesn't respond.
3672440	3676440	My name is Carlos the Unimaginative. I'm with the church of the Silver Flame.
3676440	3680440	What do you mean prove it? We don't have fax machines.
3680440	3686440	I will have somebody put their head up to the door that's sick.
3686440	3691440	He opens the door. It just opens despite all those nails.
3691440	3694440	Okay. Hi.
3694440	3698440	Hey, what's up? Thanks so much for coming.
3698440	3699440	What's your name?
3699440	3700440	Patchens.
3700440	3701440	Patchens?
3701440	3704440	Patchens with an N.
3704440	3707440	Patchens, what's with the nailed door?
3707440	3710440	Oh, people have been trying to break in or something. I don't know.
3710440	3712440	I just do what I'm told.
3712440	3714440	People? Have you experienced that?
3714440	3716440	Nope. I just heard people saying that happened.
3716440	3717440	Are you alone?
3717440	3718440	They told me to nail up the door.
3718440	3720440	Are you alone in here?
3720440	3724440	No, no. Everyone's sleeping. I'm just watching guard.
3724440	3727440	Not letting anyone in.
3727440	3729440	How many people live here?
3729440	3732440	Four, five. I can't count.
3735440	3739440	We should probably wake up your bosses and let them know we're here.
3739440	3742440	Are you sure? I mean, it's late.
3742440	3746440	This is important. There's evil at work in your town.
3746440	3747440	All right. All right.
3747440	3750440	You know what they say, if it's worth nailing a church door shut,
3750440	3754440	it's worth waking people that work in church up.
3754440	3755440	All right.
3755440	3759440	He does that. He takes you through the church.
3759440	3760440	Yeah, he just does that.
3760440	3764440	Eventually, you're at the door of just a door.
3764440	3767440	You don't know what door it is because they're not labeled.
3767440	3770440	Patchens knocks on the door, and you can hear stirring.
3770440	3774440	He's like, sir, sir, they're here. The Inquisitors are here.
3774440	3778440	And you can hear just kind of a mumbling and then like a fumbling
3778440	3784440	and an old looking guy comes up. He looks gross.
3784440	3786440	He's like a fat, gross old man.
3786440	3790440	He's wearing one of those really long night caps, and he comes up
3790440	3797440	and he's like, what is this? What's the deal?
3797440	3799440	We're Inquisitors from the Silver Flame Church.
3799440	3802440	I'm Carlos. This is Chad. This is Diarrhea Jr.
3802440	3803440	You can call him DJ.
3803440	3806440	How do we know we can trust you?
3806440	3808440	We will now...
3808440	3812440	Can't you see? What denomination is this church?
3812440	3814440	The Church of the Silver Flame, of course.
3814440	3818440	We show him our Silver Flame emblems that we wear.
3818440	3819440	Oh, yeah. Holy symbol.
3819440	3823440	He looks at him for like way too long and is really suspicious of him,
3823440	3828440	but eventually he's like, okay, all right, whatever.
3828440	3831440	You guys having some kind of problem trusting people
3831440	3833440	that look like people you should trust?
3833440	3837440	Yeah, everyone's gone evil. Sin is taking root in this town
3837440	3839440	and it's rising up all over the place.
3839440	3841440	We don't know where to turn and who to trust.
3841440	3843440	It's a terrible situation.
3843440	3846440	We don't even know to trust you.
3846440	3848440	And how do we trust you?
3848440	3852440	Exactly. That's the problem I'm having.
3852440	3856440	All right, I turn my back to him and hold my arms out to the side
3856440	3858440	and I just fall back toward him.
3858440	3860440	He catches you.
3860440	3862440	I like it.
3862440	3863440	That's a good start.
3863440	3864440	Yeah.
3864440	3865440	I'll do it.
3865440	3867440	He's holding Jeff still.
3867440	3870440	Oh, shit. Ow.
3870440	3873440	I catch Carlos.
3873440	3875440	All right. Well, then that's fine. It's all fine.
3875440	3877440	Everyone wins.
3877440	3880440	We like to do that everywhere we go just to show you.
3880440	3883440	No matter how big your problem is, it's not as big as you think.
3883440	3885440	That follows perfectly.
3886440	3889440	Can you tell us what has happened exactly?
3889440	3891440	Why are you hiding in here?
3891440	3893440	We don't know exactly.
3893440	3895440	We just know that evil is loose.
3895440	3898440	Evil spirits are messing with people and causing evil.
3898440	3903440	We think the sinners are sinning and God has taken his wrath out on us.
3905440	3913440	We're here to fix that because we eat evil for breakfast and we shit goodness.
3913440	3914440	Goodness.
3914440	3916440	Purge the unclean.
3916440	3918440	Cleanse our village.
3918440	3920440	Do you have any tips on how to do that?
3920440	3921440	Nope.
3921440	3922440	That's your job.
3922440	3923440	You're the experts, right?
3923440	3925440	Yeah, but we should...
3925440	3930440	I mean, can you take us from the moment when things were normal
3930440	3933440	by your definition to when they started to get bad?
3933440	3935440	Take us back as far as you can.
3935440	3936440	I don't know.
3936440	3940440	It just seems like it all started when Tom.
3940440	3941440	Tom was getting weird.
3941440	3943440	It seems his kid came down with some sickness.
3943440	3946440	And ever since then, weird shit's been going down.
3946440	3947440	His kid died.
3947440	3950440	We don't know if it was a punishment for his evil.
3950440	3951440	Archer?
3952440	3953440	Yeah.
3953440	3955440	That was the first kid.
3955440	3956440	Yep.
3956440	3957440	Didn't he have two kids?
3957440	3958440	Yep.
3958440	3960440	Yeah, Cliff, the one that you punched.
3961440	3964440	Now, are you saying that the father, Tom, is evil?
3964440	3966440	You don't trust him?
3966440	3970440	I don't know, but he's been acting all fucked up like an evil person would.
3970440	3971440	Oh.
3972440	3974440	We were punching the wrong guy.
3974440	3977440	We should have been punching the dad, not the son.
3978440	3981440	Well, that's what you say every time you go to a movie theater, you know?
3981440	3983440	Like, how could a kid be to blame?
3983440	3986440	But at the same time, he was the one screaming.
3990440	3992440	Wow, I didn't know...
3993440	3995440	To use language that I shouldn't be able to use,
3995440	3999440	I thought that was more of a side quest when we came into the town.
3999440	4001440	Turns out that was the A story.
4001440	4004440	Well, maybe, maybe not, but there's evil.
4004440	4008440	We just know going forward that we can't trust everybody when we meet.
4008440	4009440	Right.
4009440	4010440	Are there other possessed people?
4010440	4011440	What?
4011440	4012440	Are there other possessed people?
4012440	4013440	What are you talking about?
4013440	4014440	Possession.
4014440	4015440	That's ghosts, right?
4015440	4016440	Yeah.
4016440	4019440	Yeah, we met a kid that had an evil ghost inside him,
4019440	4021440	and it came out and then went back in.
4021440	4022440	He was possessed by a...
4022440	4024440	What the fuck are you talking about?
4024440	4026440	Tom's child, Cliff, has a ghost inside him.
4026440	4027440	We saw it.
4027440	4028440	I knew it.
4028440	4030440	Oh, he must be a fucking cultist.
4030440	4031440	Who, Tom?
4031440	4032440	Yeah.
4032440	4033440	Oh, shit.
4033440	4034440	Devil worshipers, all of them.
4034440	4035440	With a name like Fel?
4035440	4038440	That, like, means you're from hell, I think.
4038440	4040440	We never asked for his last name.
4040440	4043440	Well, I know his last name because he's a person in my village.
4043440	4044440	Tom Fel?
4044440	4045440	Oh, yeah.
4045440	4047440	Oh, like he fell from Grace?
4047440	4048440	I don't know.
4048440	4052440	Well, your last name doesn't say whether you're evil.
4052440	4053440	That doesn't make sense.
4053440	4054440	You're born with your last name.
4054440	4055440	You're a non-believer.
4055440	4057440	Shut up with your heresy.
4057440	4058440	All right.
4058440	4060440	Side bar about this guy.
4060440	4064440	If we go up, like, does this guy want us to murder a family?
4064440	4065440	What if he's the bad guy?
4065440	4068440	Yeah, I mean, I think, like, fake news.
4068440	4070440	Do sense motive on him, Carlos.
4070440	4071440	Sense motive on this dude.
4071440	4073440	What's your name, old man?
4073440	4076440	What is my name?
4076440	4077440	Two seconds.
4077440	4081440	Sense motive.
4081440	4083440	You do a sense motive.
4083440	4084440	Oh, man.
4084440	4087440	He's obviously freaking out.
4087440	4090440	He's like a paranoid man who's terrified,
4090440	4092440	like as if he's thinking the world's
4092440	4094440	going to fall on his shoulders.
4094440	4097440	And everything he does is motivated by fear.
4097440	4101440	My name is Phil Stoganwaller.
4101440	4104440	Phil Stoganwaller.
4104440	4105440	All right, Phil.
4105440	4107440	Well, you're clearly not in your right mind.
4107440	4108440	So sit down.
4108440	4110440	You're going to tell us everything.
4110440	4113440	Would you be in your right mind if demons and whatever people
4113440	4116440	were showing up talking about ghosts fucked up?
4116440	4119440	Yeah, so now empty your not right mind
4119440	4122440	so that people with righter minds can take in your information,
4122440	4125440	digest it, and go do more right shit than you've done.
4125440	4127440	That Tom is a real piece of shit.
4127440	4130440	He's coming knocking on my church door asking for help.
4130440	4132440	We're trying to deal with evil.
4132440	4133440	We can't be helping people.
4133440	4135440	He's here all over the place.
4135440	4137440	We had to lock our doors and bolt him
4137440	4139440	so he wouldn't be coming in.
4139440	4140440	It's all fucked up.
4140440	4142440	Let's go back and talk to Tom.
4142440	4147440	Tom sounds like a victim with a sick kid in a corrupt society.
4147440	4149440	I mean, what else were you dealing with
4149440	4151440	that you thought Tom wasn't a priority?
4151440	4153440	People are all fucked up.
4153440	4154440	It's evil.
4154440	4155440	Evil's in the town and everyone's being-
4155440	4156440	You're fucked up.
4156440	4157440	Look at you.
4157440	4158440	You're fucked up.
4158440	4159440	You're fucked up.
4159440	4160440	You're fucked up.
4160440	4161440	You're fucked up.
4161440	4167440	Maybe we both have a lot to learn.
4167440	4170440	Do you have anything to give us on our quest here?
4171440	4173440	I got some holy water.
4173440	4174440	Can I see it?
4174440	4175440	Can I see it?
4175440	4176440	What?
4176440	4177440	Can I see holy water?
4177440	4178440	I don't think you should hold it
4178440	4181440	after what I heard happened last time.
4181440	4184440	Yeah, I think somebody else should hold the holy water.
4184440	4186440	Just let me try something.
4186440	4187440	Okay.
4187440	4189440	Holy water on you, on him.
4189440	4190440	No.
4190440	4192440	I'm wet.
4192440	4193440	Why?
4193440	4195440	Why did you waste our holy water?
4195440	4197440	Do you have any more holy water?
4197440	4198440	I hope that wasn't all of it.
4198440	4200440	Are you going to just fucking throw it at me?
4200440	4201440	No, no.
4201440	4204440	This is going to be a terrible decision to do anything for you.
4204440	4207440	I'm going to keep it and use it on people in a safe manner
4207440	4210440	and not keep wasting all of our precious resources.
4210440	4213440	Well, I'm going to leave the room and tell you where it is.
4213440	4214440	Where is it?
4214440	4217440	It's right here and then he leaves.
4217440	4218440	All right.
4218440	4219440	I follow him.
4219440	4220440	All right.
4220440	4222440	He goes back to bed.
4222440	4224440	I stand at the foot of his bed and stare at him.
4224440	4226440	Don't throw anything at me.
4226440	4227440	I won't.
4228440	4230440	I pick up the holy water.
4230440	4231440	It's water.
4231440	4232440	Oh, well, yeah.
4232440	4233440	Okay.
4233440	4234440	You fill up a bottle or something.
4234440	4235440	Yeah.
4235440	4238440	I'll fill up one of my three glass jars.
4238440	4239440	Great.
4239440	4241440	I fill up a water skin.
4241440	4242440	I'll fill up holy water as well.
4242440	4243440	All right.
4243440	4244440	I'll fill up everything.
4244440	4246440	You're at the bed door.
4246440	4252440	I have my fear of being left out.
4252440	4254440	I follow that to the holy water.
4254440	4255440	Ha!
4255440	4256440	All right.
4256440	4258440	You're at him sleeping?
4258440	4259440	Yeah.
4259440	4260440	All right.
4260440	4261440	Fine.
4261440	4263440	I fill up my holy water containers.
4263440	4266440	You all got all the holy water.
4266440	4270640	Do you want to go back and try this holy water on Tom, the evil dad, or do you want to press
4270640	4272720	forward and see if there's bigger fish to Polk?
4272720	4275560	Okay, but what if that doesn't work?
4275560	4278000	What if we go back to Tom's house and it does nothing?
4278000	4281640	Like, we're just kind of out of our element here.
4281640	4283440	We won't know if we don't try.
4283440	4286720	Well, let's at least go out and check out these other buildings around here and just
4286720	4290000	kind of investigate the town a little bit.
4290000	4291000	So what?
4291000	4293000	I just can't hear Jeff for whatever reason.
4293000	4294000	All right.
4294000	4295360	We're going to investigate the town.
4295360	4296360	All right.
4296360	4297880	You go back into the town.
4297880	4298880	There's a hill.
4298880	4299880	Well, wait.
4299880	4300880	It's nighttime?
4300880	4301880	You're going in the nighttime?
4301880	4302880	Yeah.
4302880	4303880	Yep.
4303880	4304880	All right.
4304880	4305880	There's a hill.
4305880	4307840	You see a bunch of houses that seem to be asleep.
4307840	4314360	Someone should take a shit in the street or something so we can end the...
4314360	4317240	Is there like a town bell or anything like that?
4317240	4321440	You look for a town bell and find none.
4321440	4323600	Do you really want me to take a shit in the street?
4323600	4329200	Well, it might make a good place to end the adventure because I don't know how to end
4329200	4330200	things.
4330200	4334680	You want him to end it by taking a shit in the street?
4334680	4336080	What is that design to accomplish?
4336800	4337800	I don't know.
4337800	4341440	How else do you end a D&D chapter?
4341440	4344720	We could go back and maybe save the kid with holy water.
4344720	4345720	Okay.
4345720	4346720	Well, we have seven minutes.
4346720	4347720	So, okay.
4347720	4348720	Let's do it.
4348720	4349920	I could always come back and take a shit.
4349920	4351840	I'll be really embarrassed about it.
4351840	4352840	All right.
4352840	4354520	Let's go back to Tom's house.
4354520	4355520	Okay.
4355520	4356520	All right.
4356520	4357520	All right.
4357520	4358520	You do that.
4358520	4360520	I knock on the door.
4360520	4361520	Tom!
4361520	4362520	Wake up.
4362520	4363520	All right.
4363520	4369440	So, Tom, what do you want from my house?
4369440	4371640	I dropped my keys.
4371640	4374120	I think my keys are here somewhere.
4374120	4375480	I don't care about that.
4375480	4377720	I need these important keys.
4377720	4380840	I need these keys to help clear town of evil.
4380840	4383400	Do you think I don't have a memory?
4383400	4386880	This is insane that I'd let you back into my house at three in the morning after what
4386880	4387880	has turned us by.
4387880	4389680	I cast fire bolts and burned his door down.
4389680	4390680	Jesus.
4390680	4391680	All right.
4391680	4392680	It starts burning.
4392720	4393720	Oh, fuck.
4393720	4394720	Now you're part of a problem.
4394720	4395720	It's not instant.
4395720	4401680	I take out my water skin and try to put out the fire.
4401680	4402680	Okay.
4402680	4403680	You do that.
4403680	4404680	I'm going to go around back.
4404680	4405680	All right.
4405680	4406680	Wait.
4406680	4407680	Wait.
4407680	4408680	Did he put the fire out before it accomplished what I wanted?
4408680	4409680	Was burning the door down?
4409680	4410680	Yeah.
4410680	4413320	Well, it is still burning, but it's being dampened.
4413320	4414680	Like it started to be extinguished.
4414680	4415680	All right.
4415680	4416680	I kick the door in.
4416680	4417680	All right.
4417680	4418680	What's your strength?
4418680	4421680	Strength is 10.
4422680	4423680	Nope.
4423680	4424680	You don't kick it in.
4424680	4426680	You kick it with your little gnome foot.
4426680	4428680	DJ, kick the door.
4428680	4429680	You're big and strong.
4429680	4430680	No, no.
4430680	4431680	Well, Dan was going around back.
4431680	4432680	What were you doing, Dan?
4432680	4436800	I'm going around back because I saw that documentary about Waco, and I know that that's where the
4436800	4443760	innocent cultists will try to run out of, and I want to be able to possibly pick them
4443760	4449960	off with automatic gunfire if I'm the ATF or FBI, but not really.
4449960	4450960	Okay.
4450960	4451960	Tell me over.
4451960	4452960	Tell it to your 90s therapist.
4452960	4453960	All right.
4453960	4454960	You're stationed there behind the door.
4454960	4455960	Well, I'm going...
4455960	4457640	No, I'm actually going to the back door.
4457640	4458640	I'm actually going to...
4458640	4459640	Is there a back door?
4459640	4460640	Okay.
4460640	4461640	Can I...
4461640	4462640	I try to open it.
4462640	4463640	It's unlocked.
4463640	4464640	It's locked.
4464640	4465640	I kick it in.
4465640	4466640	Yeah.
4466640	4467640	What's your strength bonus?
4467640	4468640	Oh, shit.
4468640	4469640	Sorry.
4469640	4470640	Sorry.
4470640	4471640	Hold on.
4471640	4473840	It's coming up.
4473840	4475440	My strength is 12.
4475440	4477400	My ability modifier is plus one.
4477400	4479600	You don't kick it in.
4479600	4480600	Human size kick.
4481360	4484440	I try to talk to Tom.
4484440	4487400	Hey, Tom.
4487400	4489120	I'm just another guy.
4489120	4490960	I wasn't here earlier.
4490960	4493800	My name's DJ, and I have this holy water.
4493800	4494800	I really...
4494800	4498120	If you let me in, I think I could help your child.
4498120	4502120	How convincing do you think that was?
4502120	4504440	I mean, you've got no other options.
4504440	4505440	I'm with these two guys.
4505440	4508640	I know they didn't do a great job, but that's why they brought me here.
4508640	4509640	Kick your story in, DJ.
4509640	4510640	You're strong.
4510640	4511640	Kick it in.
4511640	4512640	Fuck this guy.
4512640	4513640	Fuck him.
4513640	4518040	I don't want to resort to violence, but I am strong enough to kick this door down.
4518040	4519080	It's just a door.
4519080	4520080	It's not violence.
4520080	4521080	It's just a door.
4521080	4523480	Please, just let me in and let me help your child.
4523480	4524760	No, fuck you.
4524760	4525760	Kick the fucking door in.
4525760	4526760	All right.
4526760	4527760	I'm going to kick the door in.
4527760	4529760	This is a great tactic.
4529760	4531160	I mean, we're great.
4531160	4532160	All right.
4532160	4534160	You also don't kick the door in.
4534160	4535160	Shit.
4535160	4539600	You hear a window open above you, and a bunch of objects start raining down on your head.
4540600	4543600	Rocks, mostly.
4543600	4544600	All right.
4544600	4545600	You all get hit by rocks.
4545600	4546600	Shit.
4546600	4547600	All of us.
4547600	4548600	All right.
4548600	4549600	All right.
4549600	4554840	You each take six damage, as heavy rocks are hurled from the second story window onto
4554840	4555840	your heads.
4555840	4557800	Well, I'm in the back there in the front.
4557800	4558800	Right.
4558800	4559800	Not you then.
4559800	4560800	Sorry.
4560800	4561800	I forgot about that.
4561800	4563360	I'm great at this game.
4563360	4564360	We should do a wrap.
4564360	4565360	Yeah.
4565360	4566360	Well, that's what I was saying.
4566360	4567360	We'll do a cliffhanger right there.
4568120	4569120	We'll do a cliffhanger right there.
4569120	4570120	We'll do a cliffhanger.
4570120	4573120	But then, kick it.
4575120	4577120	Finish it off, Harmon.
4577120	4586000	Ladies and gentlemen, you have been present at Mountain View, Palo Alto, St. Jonas, Jonestown,
4586000	4593080	California, somewhere within an hour of Los Angeles by plane's Idiot Festival, spelled
4593080	4602680	with any number of ones and zeros, O's and capital I's, and Chris Hardwick got a wick
4602680	4603680	that's hard.
4603680	4607680	Gonna fuck your mama so hard, my dick is a yard, a football field, couldn't slow it
4607680	4608680	down.
4608680	4612360	I put your mama up, I put your mama down, I put my dick in her butt, I put my dick in
4612360	4613360	her eye.
4613360	4614360	I said, hello.
4614360	4615360	Then I said, hi.
4615360	4616360	It was redundant.
4616360	4617360	Get up here.
4617360	4618360	It was a greeting.
4618360	4619360	Oh, shit.
4619600	4625040	I got a meeting with an alien, with an orange man, with fiberglass spray paint around his
4625040	4630560	hands and head, and it's some combination of references.
4630560	4631560	Here he comes.
4631560	4632560	Security's tight.
4632560	4633560	I feel safer already.
4633560	4637680	When I go out tonight, he could be ISIS, he could be Al-Qaeda.
4637680	4638680	We don't care.
4638680	4639680	I eat a tomato.
4639680	4640680	Fresh grow.
4640680	4641680	Yeah.
4641680	4651960	My name is H-A-R-M-O-N.
4651960	4652960	Your name is...
4652960	4653960	Oh, again.
4653960	4654960	Together again.
4654960	4661040	We're gonna do this just like Kitten Play.
4661040	4665040	That's where you put your foot in it.
4665040	4671040	He's too young to know Kitten Play.
4671040	4684320	Oh, my name is Morgan, and I'm sitting here, and I'm not in Oregon, hanging out with Dan
4684320	4685320	Harmon.
4685320	4686320	He's my friend, and I love him.
4686320	4687320	I'm gonna hang out, remember him forever, because I love the weather.
4687320	4688320	It is, we belong together.
4688320	4689320	Together.
4689320	4690320	We belong together.
4690320	4691320	Together.
4691320	4692320	Together.
4692320	4693320	Together.
4693320	4694320	Together.
4694320	4695320	Together.
4695320	4696320	Together.
4696320	4697320	Together.
4697320	4698320	Together.
4698320	4699320	Together.
4699320	4700320	Together.
4700600	4701600	We belong together.
4701600	4702600	All right.
4702600	4703600	Thank you, Kevin Harman, Dan and everybody.
4703600	4704600	Thank you.
4704600	4705600	Thank you so much.
4705600	4706600	What's your name again, sir?
4706600	4707600	What's your name?
4707600	4708600	I'm Morgan.
4708600	4709600	It's Morgan, everybody.
4709600	4710600	Thank you, Morgan.
4710600	4711600	Thank you, everybody.
4711600	4712600	Thank you, everybody here on sound.
4712600	4713600	Thank you, Carter, back there on the EDM lights.
4713600	4714600	Steve Levy, everybody.
4714600	4715600	Spencer Crichton.
4715600	4716600	I'm Jeff Davis.
4716600	4717600	Your mayor, Dan Harmon.
4717600	4718600	Thank you so much.
4718600	4719600	Enjoy the rest of your idiot fest, everybody.
4719600	4720600	Thank you.
4720600	4720600	
4730320	4732400	Now, get these chairs out of here.
4732400	4734040	You're going to dance in this tent.
4734040	4736200	There's dancing in this tent.
4736200	4737200	I think.
4737200	4738200	I think that's what's next.
4738200	4755200	Did you get any of that?
