0	7000	From beautiful downtown Los Angeles, from MacArthur Park, hepatitis district,
7000	12000	to identity typewriter, Perfect Town is once again in session.
19000	25000	For your delectation and delight, let's bring out the Game Master and our good friend Spencer Crittenden.
31000	36000	Be He From Heaven, Be He From Hell, the damn Elizabeth Peppernell.
36000	39000	Let's welcome the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
45000	53000	Yep, yep, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, MLK, MLK Day, Don't Go Away, It's a Great Day,
53000	58000	Honorary Command, it made lots of hay while the sun shone, even though it didn't.
58000	65000	Okay, yeah, we got a lot, I mean, I got a lot of balls opening with some rest in peace.
66000	69000	I don't know if you can see, there's a little sound board and a laptop behind me,
69000	73000	but we're probably going to be doing some, a fair share of Pippin and Hoppin tonight.
73000	75000	There's going to be a lot of show tonight.
75000	77000	It's MLK Day, it's, uh...
77000	79000	Oh, Steve Levy's comparing gifts.
79000	83000	Oh, yeah, he's got the alcohol ice bucket.
83000	84000	Yeah.
85000	93000	We honor a man today that, whose Wikipedia page is probably crippled for 24 hours.
94000	98000	I know I was all over it in the green room so that I could learn the following.
99000	101000	Really interesting stuff for me.
101000	105000	I like some, some, some tidbits that I didn't know.
105000	107000	He invented the typewriter.
107000	113000	He was, he was, he was, he was, he suffered from depression when he was a kid.
113000	115000	There's stories about, you know, that having causes.
115000	119000	Obviously that wasn't a big, you know, mental, uh, fitness wasn't like a,
119000	122000	it wasn't like a, an understood thing back then.
122000	126000	I do think it was by the FBI. It's fucking crazy if you knew that.
126000	131000	It's, it's never a good idea for a government to write a letter to a guy saying,
131000	134000	we have recordings of you fucking all these women.
134000	139000	You should, uh, save your, you know, that letter that the FBI wrote to him in his adulthood
139000	141000	at the peak of him being targeted by Hoover.
141000	146000	What I didn't know is, and what Hoover surely knew when that letter was sent to him,
146000	149000	is that he tried to jump out a window when he was 12 years old.
149000	152000	He did jump out a window. He didn't try. He tried to, tried to kill himself.
152000	158000	I, I, uh, um, and, and, you know, his dad, his dad was real hard on him, uh, uh,
158000	162000	physically, but his dad was, you know,
162000	165000	kind of an inspiration to him in terms of like his, his dad's,
165000	168000	his dad's personality being very uncompromising.
168000	172000	It's, it's a funny thing because here's his, his dad is like,
172000	176000	kind of not afraid to take a stick to somebody, but at the same time,
176000	182000	probably part and parcel of that persona is also why his dad would do these things like,
182000	186000	you know, if somebody called him boy, he would, you know, he wouldn't,
186000	187000	he wouldn't lay down for it.
187000	189000	He would confront people or he'd walk out of a store that,
189000	192000	that, that asked him to go in the back and things like that.
192000	198000	So he's watching these two things, you know, from this, from this mythical father.
198000	203000	That's like both the, the, the punisher and the, I mean,
203000	206000	it was like the devil and God kind of at the same time.
206000	210000	That was kind of interesting. Somebody should make a biopic about this guy.
210000	214000	Uh, what other, what other tidbits did I learn?
214000	218000	Uh, it was, I didn't know that there was, that he was born,
218000	225000	him and his, that his dad changed the, the, the, the names to, uh, Martin.
225000	233000	Uh, I think for him and his, uh, son after he went in the thirties to Germany
233000	236000	and he was so inspired by the story of Martin Luther,
236000	238000	they actually had birth certificates changed.
238000	243000	Uh, the, uh, their name was, their name was, their name was King.
243000	249000	I don't know if it was it, but, uh, uh, Martin Luther King Jr. was born Michael
249000	252000	and then birth certificate was changed later to Martin, I believe.
252000	257000	Wikipedia, Wikipedia facts about, about, about, about a guy.
257000	261000	Uh, but imagine, I was like, I was realizing like,
261000	265000	this guy watched JFK get assassinated, right?
265000	267000	So he like, and there's lots of quotes.
267000	270000	If you go through the MLK quotes for your Instagram, you know,
270000	272000	you're going to, you can see all the, you scroll down.
272000	278000	You see like a fair share of, of like real Christ-like,
278000	283000	like go into the spiritual mattress in terms of like, you, if there's,
283000	286000	you know, unless you're willing to die for something,
286000	288000	it doesn't matter kind of stuff.
288000	292000	Like, like, like more, more than one quote about that and kind of,
292000	296000	you have, you have to know that this guy, like more than anybody ever,
296000	300000	like he kind of like had to make peace with that idea that I am probably
300000	304000	going to get, uh, I'm very likely to get assassinated.
304000	309000	I mean, the president of the United States died and, you know,
309000	313000	like he watched it happen during this turbulent time.
313000	318000	And it's like, okay, so like, what am, what am I going to hide behind?
318000	319000	I mean, just imagine that.
319000	326000	I can't even, did, did, uh, who died first, uh, uh, RFK or, or MLK?
327000	329000	No, no RFK is on second.
329000	335000	I'm wondering if he also watched, uh, Bobby Kennedy get shot and like,
335000	336000	I mean,
336000	339000	I don't know what ordered Bobby and, and, uh,
339000	341000	I was like, once the president is just in a motorcade,
341000	342000	it's just like kaboom.
342000	346000	And then you're like, you're a civil rights activist to the FBI is trying to
346000	347000	make kill yourself.
347000	351000	I mean, you have to be just like, there must be almost maybe the only good
351000	353000	news of that is that maybe you get to wake up in the morning and be like,
353000	357000	okay, so like get over that or don't like, like, like you get like,
357000	360000	if I leave the house today, it's because I got a mission.
360000	364000	Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, if, if my objective is safety,
364000	367000	then I guess I should shut the fuck up and you know,
367000	370000	like hide under a rock and they'll probably still find me.
370000	374000	It just reminds me very much of Gethsemane and, and that U2 song.
374000	375000	Uh, all right.
375000	379000	So, uh, anyways, there's a, here's it.
379000	382000	Nothing should remind anybody of any U2 song.
382000	385000	I fucking hate U2.
385000	388000	Uh, why is there U2 on my, I didn't download it.
388000	389000	It's on my fucking.
389000	390000	Oh yeah.
390000	392000	I don't know how to get rid of this guy.
392000	396000	It's just, it's on there like, like a Sharpie written on your hand.
396000	398000	You have to wash it for the rest of your life.
398000	400000	That was like 15 years ago.
400000	401000	I know.
401000	405000	I just turned my music out of my car and I got,
405000	410000	I'm like, what the fuck did I do to U2?
410000	411000	All right.
411000	412000	The latest.
412000	413000	So now somebody's ever.
413000	414000	No, I'm not done.
414000	415000	Dan.
415000	416000	Oh, sorry.
416000	419000	No, I just, how do you, how do you hijack my iPad?
419000	421000	Somebody's air dropping.
421000	424000	Oh no.
424000	428000	It's a meme that says two Jews, one brain.
428000	429000	Oh no.
429000	430000	What does that mean?
430000	435000	I don't, I, the, maybe the, maybe the Jews aren't as smart as a whole person
435000	437000	or does it, is it, is it a reference to.
437000	438000	They're air dropping you.
438000	439000	Yeah.
439000	440000	It's a, you know.
440000	441000	What the fuck?
441000	442000	Is that person here?
442000	443000	Yeah.
443000	444000	Let's bring, let's bring them up.
444000	445000	Why?
445000	446000	They're anti-Semitic.
446000	448000	If you're here, I'm joking.
448000	449000	Just state the fuck.
449000	450000	Oh, it's like, I'm sorry.
450000	455000	I thought it was, uh, well now, now I just promoted them, but also it might be worth
455000	457000	noting that, uh, it's a comedy podcast.
457000	459000	That's a comedy podcast.
459000	460000	Two Jews, one brain.
460000	468000	So now we assume that the titular Jews are probably okay saying two Jews, one brain.
468000	469000	Sure.
469000	471000	We're, we're, I don't know.
471000	474000	I'm still, I'm not willing to get that comfortable yet.
474000	475000	I'm still on edge.
475000	479000	But I saw, I saw a hand go up so that I hear, but I'm not sure I want to fucking.
479000	480000	Yeah.
480000	483000	I mean, I, yeah, I don't think, I don't think that's how you should get your podcast
483000	484000	signal boost.
484000	485000	Right.
485000	486000	You don't just get to, you don't just get to be.
486000	491000	I think you should be targeted by the FBI for a while or something.
491000	495000	I don't, I don't mind if it's a good podcast, but I don't want, I don't want, there are
495000	499000	people that sitting in their seats going like, Oh, well now what do I got to do?
499000	501000	I feel like a dollar.
501000	502000	A dollar.
502000	508000	Like, like, like what is this world where the squeaky wheel gets the grease?
508000	509000	Yeah.
509000	510000	I don't know.
510000	511000	I don't know.
511000	512000	Nice people.
512000	513000	I don't know what to tell you.
513000	514000	I'm sorry.
514000	517000	So there's a podcast and I'm not, I'm not going to promote this shit.
517000	518000	That's good.
518000	519000	I believe the jokes on them.
519000	521000	They're not, they're never going to make any money in podcasting.
521000	523000	I mean, they're going to, that's the true.
523000	524000	Yeah.
524000	526000	It might actually be their punishment.
526000	529000	If we direct a little bit of traffic to them enough to keep them from getting real jobs.
529000	533000	And let's just remind everybody it's called three Jews, four brains.
533000	540000	So go to three Jews, four brains.com hashtag three Jews, four brains.com.
540000	543000	I will signal boost a couple of things.
543000	544000	There's just Netflix things.
544000	546000	This is our next segment that we'll bring on our guest.
546000	551000	This is, uh, uh, Dan Harmon's life now is sitting in bed watching Netflix.
551000	552000	Uh,
552000	553000	Oh,
553000	554000	Oh,
554000	555000	Oh,
555000	556000	Oh,
556000	557000	Oh,
557000	558000	Oh,
558000	559000	Oh,
559000	560000	Oh,
560000	561000	Oh,
561000	562000	Oh,
562000	563000	Oh,
563000	564000	Oh,
564000	565000	Oh,
565000	566000	Oh,
566000	567000	Oh,
567000	568000	Oh,
568000	569000	Oh,
569000	570000	Oh,
570000	571000	Oh,
571000	572000	Oh,
573000	574000	All right. Well,
574000	576000	you gotta watch the bravo dirty John adaptation.
576000	577000	Even if you heard the podcast.
577000	578000	It's crazy.
578000	580000	The bravo dirty John thing.
580000	581000	Oh man.
581000	582000	Everybody see that?
582000	583000	Did you check it out?
583000	584000	You watched it.
584000	585000	Yeah.
585000	586000	Well, how long is that?
586000	587000	What's the episodes?
587000	588000	What happens?
588000	589000	You kill it in like eight hours or something.
589000	590000	I gotcha.
590000	591000	Yeah. Yeah.
591000	592000	The podcast was nuts.
592000	593000	Yeah.
593000	594000	And as I mean,
594000	596000	you could go from the podcast to the it's not like unenjoyable to watch the
596000	597000	adaptation.
597000	599000	It's somewhat more enjoyable because the thing is having.
599000	600000	Listen to the podcast.
600000	603220	then you know that the young ladies,
603220	604780	all the actors are killing it,
604780	606720	but the young ladies who are playing the daughters,
606720	608780	you know from listening to their interviews in the podcast
608780	611540	that they're not doing caricatures of like,
611540	613460	it's a really interesting thing.
613460	618460	These daughters, I won't spoil the story of Dirty John,
619540	621260	but these daughters are just like,
621260	625440	so if you wrote characters like this in your sitcom
625440	629260	or your movie, they would be so, you would by default,
629280	630800	you'd be like, oh, and they're bad people
630800	632760	just because of the trappings of them.
632760	635120	They're just like these kind of like,
635120	639320	they judge their mom's relationships
639320	641000	and police them and all these things
641000	642560	because the mom's been divorced four times
642560	643680	and they're just sort of like,
643680	646160	they're just like, hey, I got you a chai tea latte.
646160	647640	Oh my God, was he here again?
647640	648480	And it's just sort of like,
648480	650980	they're fully committed to these characters,
650980	652720	but they're great actors playing these characters.
652720	657000	Plus those daughters, you know, emerge as heroes,
657000	659620	which is all I can really say about the story
659620	660460	without spoiling it,
660460	662660	but it's just interesting as a writer exercise
662660	666620	when you're like, yeah, there's characters
666620	668160	with depth that you're supposed to like,
668160	670740	and then there's characters that are like so fun
670740	672280	because they're two dimensional,
672280	674600	but only in a real life adaptation of something
674600	677780	as a writer forced to take people that actually sound
677780	682620	to seem two dimensional and walk them through the story
682620	685740	where they're their heroes.
685760	689300	And it's like, it's a stranger than fiction kind of thing.
689300	691800	Yeah, it's just, just watch it.
692960	693800	You're gonna like it.
693800	696160	I mean, watch it for 30 seconds and you'll watch it for 40.
696160	698560	I mean, that's the Harmon guarantee on Dirty John.
700720	703360	Likewise, the documentary Three Identical Strangers.
703360	704200	Check that out.
704200	706000	I think everybody's talking about that.
706000	709560	The abducted in plain sight.
709560	710520	Whoo doggy.
711840	714080	Boy, at what price Mormonism?
714980	716820	Check that one out.
716820	717660	I don't even know.
717660	720180	That's what I've been saying.
720180	722020	It's just that after the Elizabeth Smart thing,
722020	727020	I listened to the Elizabeth Smart book on tape
727420	730580	and it was so, it's this weird double edged sword
730580	733780	because like the only way she survived that ordeal
733780	735140	was through her faith.
735140	737580	Like, I mean, she's such a resilient person
737580	741300	and I genuinely admire whenever I see,
741300	743540	whenever in real life you hear stories about,
743680	745240	that involve Mormonism, it's like,
745240	747040	you come up against this like,
747040	749440	you're like, geez, you guys really,
749440	751000	you really believe in God.
751000	754680	You know, like, that's crazy how much you believe in God.
754680	756600	Like, and it really gets them through shit
756600	759840	and it makes them friendly and like forgiving,
759840	763040	like the forgiveness, like the weaponized forgiveness.
763040	765480	Like, it's crazy.
765480	770080	Like, they're able to forgive the fuck out of things.
770540	775220	And I mean, it's really inspirational to anybody
775220	777900	who's like a mainstream, just run of the mill,
777900	781520	podunk fucking blue pill Christian.
785100	788100	You gotta take that, what color pill would be Mormonism?
788100	791740	You gotta take that daffodil pill.
794700	796140	Anyways, but watch this.
796140	799340	So this documentary, the abducted in plain sight,
799360	804320	it's another tale of child exploitation
804320	805600	and abduction and stuff like that.
805600	809360	But it is like only within a Mormon community
809360	811880	does it seem as stuff as possible.
811880	812800	It's just crazy.
812800	814320	Watch it and then we'll talk about it.
814320	815380	I'll give you a week.
816380	817880	But I did, when we were watching it,
817880	819760	Cody and I were talking about,
819760	821560	here's like a little Mormon thing.
823280	824680	Should there be theme music for this?
824680	827720	When the Mormons, when they go to their Mormon college
827740	830860	and stuff and they're like regular biological horny teenagers
830860	833860	but they're Mormon, like they have developed these,
833860	835940	every, any religion, if you're committing to it
835940	838100	and you're a teenager, there's gonna be these things
838100	838940	they're gonna develop.
838940	842580	This is not about judging anybody for their faith
843540	846140	or saying like, oh, those people are crazy.
846140	847940	Anybody, any place where there's,
847940	851220	if you gotta believe in God and you're living in America,
851220	854100	some shit's gonna be nuts as a byproduct.
854100	857060	So this is not about punching down.
857280	858180	He proclaimed.
859680	862560	But it's just weird, this shit,
862560	864560	so there's this thing called soaking.
866520	867360	Whoa.
867360	870040	It's like kids, so we've heard with Catholic kids,
870040	873640	if you're really Catholic, you hear these stories,
873640	875200	we're like, oh, well, I'm still a virgin
875200	876880	if we do it in the butt, that kind of thing.
876880	878800	So now that I've said that,
878800	880280	I'm not judging like Mormons,
880280	881960	but there's this thing called soaking
881960	885320	where they're like, the kids get themselves convinced
885340	888540	like that, well, if you just put it in
888540	889720	and you don't move it,
891500	893300	that's not sex.
893300	895860	Everybody knows sex is like back and forth.
895860	898220	So if you just marinate it,
900460	902540	you're not, God doesn't see that.
902540	904580	He doesn't hear that cricket leg.
905500	908020	Yeah, it's like in a quiet place.
908020	909420	If you don't move the dick.
909420	911620	Yeah.
911620	914820	Well, yeah, I used to be Mormon and when I was a kid,
915720	918560	of course, I was soaking all the time.
918560	923240	I was soaking to the East, I was soaking to the West.
923240	925760	I was soaking with the Mormon that I loved the best.
925760	928200	But this is the thing, that's the thing I believe.
928200	929540	This is the part where I actually,
929540	932220	I mean, Cody and I were like, that can't be real.
932220	934120	And then we looked it up and who knows
934120	936360	if you look something up whether it's real or not.
936360	941360	But along with soaking comes the concept of jumpers.
941420	945180	Jumpers are friends whose aid you solicit.
945180	948020	If the soaking, as I imagine it would,
948020	950780	starts to become unsatisfying.
950780	952120	Oh.
952120	957120	And you can have your friends come over and-
957740	958580	They jump you.
958580	962740	And they stand on the mattress and kind of jump.
962740	963920	They're jumping.
963920	965140	They're jumping.
965140	966580	So now, you're soaking.
966580	967420	You're soaking.
967420	970100	This is just soaking turbulence.
970160	971320	This is science.
971320	973080	That's all it is.
973080	974720	And the worst thing that can happen
974720	977420	is that you could become Supreme Court Justice.
979000	980480	Hashtag Kavanaugh.
980480	982760	I mean, don't all paths lead to Rome?
982760	985960	And can't you at that point, if you're soaking and jumping
985960	988920	and you're still getting into heaven,
988920	990320	can't you just go all the way with it
990320	993520	and call the sperm that comes out
993520	997080	in the event of an over jump soak?
998060	1000340	Just say that that sperm doesn't count
1000340	1004340	because the tadpoles are Lutheran or something.
1006620	1010740	Just have the baby and raise it and say,
1010740	1014300	well, you were conceived as a jumper baby.
1015180	1016860	So you can do whatever you want.
1016860	1018420	And if you, but you should,
1018420	1019740	no, we love you because we're Mormon.
1019740	1021940	You can have caffeine.
1021940	1022860	You can have caffeine.
1022860	1025940	You can watch Reagan and Andy's Christmas Special at school.
1027820	1029420	I don't know if Mormons had to,
1029420	1031500	do they, is that like Jehovah's Witnesses?
1031500	1034180	Like Jehovah's Witnesses always had to leave the room
1034180	1035180	when we were in grade school.
1035180	1037560	They had to, when we would sing Christmas carols
1037560	1041480	and watch Christmas shows, like when we were kids
1041480	1042420	and Christmas would come around
1042420	1043300	and then the Jehovah's Witnesses
1043300	1045580	would have to go out in the hallway.
1045580	1047940	They would have to or they chose to?
1047940	1050140	Well, it's not like the teacher was like,
1050140	1055140	oh, here's our Christ, Frosty meets Christ.
1057220	1061100	Special, hey, Carl, get the, you know,
1061100	1062820	I mean, they'd raise their hand
1062820	1066140	and maybe if the teacher was new, they'd explain,
1066140	1068860	but over the years it was like, yeah, okay, yeah,
1068860	1069940	get out of here.
1069940	1072540	Spoil sport, go run the halls.
1072540	1075860	Yeah, hey, we're gonna force people to watch stupid shit.
1075860	1077780	Go do what you want.
1077780	1081340	Jehovah's Witnesses also, my memory of all of those kids,
1081340	1084220	like four or five of them in my public school,
1084240	1087560	incredibly friendly, like just nonjudgmental,
1087560	1091040	like, yeah, it's weird, this double-edged sword of like,
1091040	1092640	when these religions that kind of,
1092640	1094960	yeah, they got a bit of a Steve Jobs approach
1094960	1098400	as far as accessibility to their children's souls.
1098400	1100200	Like, you know, it's like, no,
1100200	1102040	we don't want any of your viruses
1102040	1103240	ideologically or anything.
1103240	1106600	So, you know, we'll just be behind these walls
1106600	1111020	and we'll kind of curate the American experience
1111020	1111860	for these folks.
1111880	1116860	It's not gonna take part in your general pastie show.
1116860	1120200	Like, it produces, you know,
1120200	1121980	it's like you get your good results
1121980	1126160	and you get your swarm of 19-year-olds
1126160	1128160	who are like on the internet going,
1128160	1130160	let's compare notes about being a Jehovah's Witness
1130160	1132120	and it starts to get pretty,
1132120	1134240	that religion's got PR problems.
1134240	1136600	Have I told you, Dan, like on the show before,
1136600	1138720	about my Mormon friend from high school,
1138720	1141040	like the nicest family, they throw these great parties
1141060	1143580	and they're probably one of the wealthiest families
1143580	1146020	at our school and they would throw these giant parties
1146020	1148020	and my friend Roy was like the coolest dude
1148020	1149620	and got along with everybody
1149620	1152300	and it's like, that family made such a case
1152300	1154660	for being Mormon because they were so awesome.
1154660	1156900	They were just like the most generous, lovely people.
1156900	1159660	Have I told you the story about the church sign?
1159660	1161340	You know, there's little billboards
1161340	1162820	that put out little things that say,
1162820	1166100	like, hey, this Sunday, Jesus loves you,
1166100	1169100	like little placards out in front of the thing.
1170080	1172440	Roy was the nicest straight A student,
1172440	1174880	the most meek and mild, lovely dude.
1174880	1178620	He called me, I think Matt Gorley, a few other people
1178620	1182200	and said, get up and drive around town
1182200	1183920	and look at these five churches.
1184960	1187120	And they had all put up this,
1187120	1189440	I forget which denomination it is,
1189440	1192760	but they'd all put up this thing that says God cares.
1192760	1196880	And lovely meek, never heard a fly,
1196880	1198960	like straight A student Roy,
1199060	1202060	went out and changed all of them to dog races.
1202060	1204620	He just couldn't resist.
1206540	1209220	He worships a higher power called wordplay.
1210780	1212620	But for three hours, you could drive around
1212620	1215380	the wood here in California and it was just dog races.
1216660	1218180	When he dies, he goes to heaven
1218180	1223180	and Gabriel just stone faced points over
1223660	1226380	to this like dog track where he has to spend eternity.
1226380	1227500	It's like, you're not going to hell,
1227520	1230880	but you have to like, I hope you have allergies.
1234800	1237200	Why are all these, these are all the dogs.
1237200	1238560	These races are going to go on forever.
1238560	1241700	Yeah, you have to race every single one of them.
1241700	1244400	By the way, they age seven times faster than a person.
1244400	1247520	So you're never getting in.
1247520	1248360	Damn.
1248360	1249240	You're not getting into heaven.
1249240	1251040	I'm going to restart this.
1251040	1252360	I've got them workshopping.
1252360	1253440	You're not getting into heaven
1253440	1255240	until you've raced every dog.
1256220	1257740	Wait, he has to race the dogs himself?
1257740	1261260	Yeah, each dog needs to be individually raced.
1261260	1264460	But him versus the dog or other dogs racing each other?
1264460	1266900	Yeah, they all have to be raced versus another dog.
1266900	1269900	I think it's better if he has to race every dog.
1269900	1273380	Because all dogs go to heaven
1273380	1276080	and he has to race every one of them.
1276080	1278340	It's like Tantalus or Sisyphus or something.
1278340	1279180	What about Kujo?
1279180	1280820	Do you think he went to heaven?
1280820	1282200	He was terrifying.
1282200	1283900	It wasn't his fault.
1283900	1285220	It wasn't Kujo's fault.
1286040	1287520	Well, is it Jeffrey Dahmer's fault?
1287520	1288500	What are we saying?
1289600	1291560	Yes, it was Jeffrey Dahmer's fault.
1291560	1293880	What's the difference between Kujo and Dahmer?
1293880	1295800	People are refrigerators and fucking fuck them and shit.
1295800	1298600	Obviously, people don't do that unless they're fucked up.
1298600	1300280	Kujo is a fucked up dog.
1300280	1301520	Dahmer is a fucked up guy.
1301520	1303000	Like, what are we?
1303000	1303840	Damn.
1303840	1304680	I don't understand.
1304680	1306340	All dogs go to heaven.
1306340	1307720	Kujo is up in heaven going,
1307720	1311040	look everybody, I'm sorry, I had a bad run.
1311040	1313760	If I, Kujo killed people.
1313760	1314920	Probably a mailman, I assume.
1314940	1315760	I've never seen the movie,
1315760	1319020	but I assume the first to go is a mailman.
1319020	1321280	He killed 14 frisbees.
1322300	1323740	God knows how many tennis balls.
1323740	1327900	If you are a Christian mailman killed by Kujo,
1327900	1330260	you go to heaven and you're like,
1330260	1331740	and they're checking the book and they're like,
1331740	1333260	oh, the mailman's here.
1333260	1335060	Looks like you steamed open a couple
1335060	1338660	of clearinghouse sweepstakes things.
1338660	1339900	Yeah, I'm sorry.
1339900	1342820	I just wanted to see what they looked like on the inside
1342820	1344320	because my wife won't let me open them.
1344340	1345860	It's not like I thought I was gonna
1345860	1347180	steal somebody's winnings.
1347180	1349420	I, you know, you can't lie up here.
1349420	1351220	We can read your mind.
1351220	1353620	I accept that, thank you.
1353620	1355620	And they're like, they're murmuring and he's like,
1355620	1357620	fuck, God damn it, I'm so fucked.
1357620	1358460	And then you just hear like,
1358460	1360400	woof, woof, woof, woof,
1360400	1362340	and you look through the pearly gates
1362340	1365180	and fucking Kujo's running around,
1365180	1368740	fetching a ball for Tom Hanks's dad.
1368740	1371000	I was just trying to think of someone
1371000	1372780	who's guaranteed heaven.
1372800	1374160	And you ask that mailman to go,
1374160	1377160	oh, wow, if Kujo's in here, then I'm good to go.
1377160	1379240	No, you're in line getting your balls busted
1379240	1380520	by the velvet roper.
1380520	1385120	And Kujo's like, you're like,
1385120	1386280	is that Kujo?
1386280	1387120	And they're like, yeah.
1387120	1387940	And they're like,
1389360	1391840	and you're pointing at the gaping fucking bite wound
1391840	1392680	on your neck.
1392680	1393500	Right.
1393500	1394720	And Gabriel's like,
1396360	1398320	look, all dogs go to heaven.
1398320	1399160	I'm sure Kujo.
1400520	1402120	Is there a comment box?
1402120	1404380	I'm sure Kujo, when he went up to the pearly gates,
1404380	1406220	he got his balls busted too.
1406220	1408460	And they're like, who's a bad boy?
1409660	1411660	Who's been a bad boy?
1411660	1413580	And then Kujo's gonna be like, fuck you,
1413580	1414420	I'll pee on you,
1414420	1415500	because all dogs go to heaven.
1415500	1416660	I already heard.
1418020	1420980	Like, you need, you need, you need to,
1420980	1422260	like that's what I'm saying.
1422260	1424580	You either, it's pick a lane heaven.
1426500	1429100	If I go to heaven and I seek a happy Kujo,
1429120	1432720	who's been like, who has atoned for his Kujo sins,
1432720	1435240	I'd be like, oh, this is, this is a good heaven.
1435240	1436400	I don't think all dogs go to heaven.
1436400	1438160	I think they picked that as a title for a movie
1438160	1440520	that they wanted to trick you into watching.
1440520	1443520	I don't think that's an official biblical stance.
1443520	1446120	I think dogs cannot accept Christ as their savior.
1447800	1451600	If it's hard, hard for a rich man to get into heaven
1451600	1453520	through the eye of a needle or whatever it is,
1453520	1454680	like, like, what is it?
1454680	1458720	A camel, a camel can't get through a needle,
1458720	1461640	but a camel can get through the eye of a needle
1461640	1464260	faster than a rich man can get into heaven.
1464260	1467260	So that poor camel, like,
1467260	1469460	well, the camel, was the camel going to heaven?
1469460	1472160	No, the camel's going through a needle.
1472160	1474020	So the camel doesn't get into heaven at all.
1474020	1474860	He just gets put through a needle.
1474860	1476940	No, that's not a table for the camel.
1476940	1479060	But they're just using camels as a metaphor.
1479060	1480940	Right, camels don't sin, as we all know.
1480940	1483640	What about camels that refuse to go through the needle?
1483640	1485180	I think when the Bible was written,
1485180	1487260	that was the biggest animal they could think of.
1487280	1489840	They didn't know about elephants or shit.
1489840	1491200	It was the humpiest animal.
1491200	1494640	They probably saw elephants, but they're like,
1494640	1496640	well, they're like, let's be clever about this,
1496640	1500560	because a camel's so humpy that even if you made it
1500560	1502760	a big needle, it would still be like,
1504360	1507080	it'd still be an arduous process to get it through.
1507080	1510080	It'd be like putting a key on a key chain.
1510080	1511480	That's what they, they just didn't have key chains.
1511480	1514720	They were like, it's harder for a rich man
1514720	1516520	to get into heaven than it is to put a key
1516520	1517460	in a new key chain.
1517460	1519460	Yeah, it's harder for a rich man to get into heaven.
1519460	1520540	If you don't have fingernails.
1520540	1524620	Than to put your USB into any USB port.
1524620	1527140	Yeah, you have a better chance of getting into heaven
1527140	1529180	as a rich man than you do of guessing right
1529180	1530780	when you plug in a USB.
1530780	1534380	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
1534380	1537620	This is the King Harmon edition of the Bible.
1537620	1539580	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
1539580	1542460	All right, well, let's discuss it all
1542460	1544820	with our old friend, Open Mike Eagle.
1544880	1545800	Yeah!
1545800	1546640	Yeah!
1546640	1547480	Yeah!
1547480	1548300	Yeah!
1548300	1549140	Yeah!
1549140	1549960	Yeah!
1549960	1550780	Yeah!
1550780	1551620	Yeah!
1551620	1552460	Yeah!
1552460	1553280	Yeah!
1553280	1554120	Yeah!
1554120	1554960	Yeah!
1554960	1555780	Yeah!
1555780	1556620	Yeah!
1556620	1557460	Yeah!
1557460	1558280	Yeah!
1558280	1559100	Yeah!
1559100	1559940	Yeah!
1559940	1560760	Yeah!
1560760	1561600	What's up, Mike?
1561600	1562440	Hey, how's it going?
1562440	1563280	Good.
1563280	1564680	I think all dogs go to dog heaven.
1564680	1566600	Oh, it's like a shitty heaven.
1566600	1569580	Well, if you're a dog, it's the best heaven.
1569580	1570660	Cause it's just dogs.
1570660	1572520	Well, cause they don't have anything to compare it to.
1572520	1573960	True.
1573960	1579560	Do you think it's they achieve heaven fatigue
1579560	1581600	seven times faster?
1581600	1583640	I never heard of heaven fatigue before.
1583640	1586640	I guess that's something most of us assume.
1586640	1588880	It's like an eternity of anything.
1588880	1591720	How many millennia does it take for you to be like,
1591720	1593200	oh, I wish I could die.
1595840	1597600	Maybe there's a reset button.
1597600	1599280	Oh, and you could just forget who you are?
1599280	1600240	You could forget, yes.
1600240	1602480	You can have coming to heaven all over again
1602480	1603440	any time you want it.
1603440	1607480	It starts to remove all meaning from any of it.
1607480	1608760	It's like, oh, I'll just, I mean,
1608760	1609920	because I bet you would do that.
1609920	1612640	You would achieve, I guess it gets very Eastern,
1612640	1614320	because it's basically like you'd
1614320	1618560	achieve this kind of ultimate perfectionity to go, well,
1618560	1620000	then let me experience.
1620000	1622000	And you'd go back down and be like a termite or something.
1622000	1622680	No, don't go back.
1622680	1624440	No, I just mean start heaven over.
1624440	1625040	Right.
1625040	1627920	Not start life over, because that would be terrible.
1627920	1629600	OK, I want to talk about dog heaven.
1629600	1631040	Resetting a game.
1631040	1632040	Yeah.
1632040	1633880	But it's just heaven again.
1633880	1635160	Heaven plus.
1635160	1637040	I wouldn't mind getting reincarnated on Earth
1637040	1638680	if you could prestige all the time.
1638680	1641000	I don't like this idea, like, prestige in video games.
1641000	1645880	Like, send me back, but give me a rocket launcher.
1645880	1647640	Like, new life, new game plus.
1647640	1650000	Like, you're born with a rocket launcher.
1650000	1652920	So they're like weighing you, and you're like, fuck you.
1652920	1655520	You keep all your experience points from your last life.
1655520	1659560	You can now just like water ski without learning.
1659560	1662360	This baby's great at water skiing.
1662360	1662880	Why?
1662880	1663880	Don't ask questions.
1663880	1665920	It has a rocket launcher.
1665920	1668880	Why does your baby have a rocket launcher?
1668880	1672760	I do think we'll experience life where babies can have skills.
1672760	1675960	It's going to be scary, but I think with genetic engineering,
1675960	1678560	that's something we're going to have to contend with.
1678560	1679480	Whoa.
1679480	1680680	Skill babies.
1680680	1681400	Skill babies.
1681400	1682560	That's crazy.
1682560	1683800	I buy it.
1683800	1684280	See?
1684280	1684920	Holy shit.
1684920	1685960	There's going to be skill babies,
1685960	1687320	but they're going to be like, it's
1687320	1691360	going to be like the army reserves where the parents will
1691360	1691960	have a right.
1691960	1694920	They'll go like, getting pregnant will cost so much money.
1694920	1695480	You know?
1695480	1697400	Like, they'll come to you and go like, so you want to procreate.
1697400	1699440	You want to breathe some of this fucking air?
1699440	1702720	Which, by the way, on the Dow Jones is now like,
1702720	1704040	more than diamonds.
1704040	1704560	Sure.
1704560	1708400	I don't think diamonds are on the Dow Jones, but they're like,
1708400	1712920	so you're going to bring a fucking rando into this planet
1712920	1716680	where we're like fighting over molecules.
1716680	1718720	What's in it for society?
1718720	1720520	And you're going to be like, well, you know,
1720520	1724760	Julie is very good at painting, and I created community.
1727600	1728520	What happened to Cody?
1728520	1729320	Who's this Julie?
1732120	1735480	That was a weird juggle of real life,
1735480	1738160	and then you made it you.
1738160	1740440	That's honest, though.
1740440	1742720	But then that was Duncan Trussell
1742720	1744840	and I were talking about that, where it'll be like,
1744840	1748680	if you can basically sell the first 20
1748680	1752560	years of your unborn kid's life to various corporations.
1752560	1756960	Sort of like a fusion of the Israeli army and internships.
1756960	1764800	And so they go, we're going to give your kid extra charisma
1764800	1770160	if they work for Apple for two years, from 15 to 17.
1770160	1772360	And then the army goes like, we'll
1772360	1778320	make him jump high if he does it with a gun on his head
1778320	1779600	for two more years than that.
1779600	1780240	And you'll be like, OK.
1780240	1782040	I think the thing where the babies get skills
1782040	1783440	come way before that.
1783440	1785120	Baby skills, we're just going to help.
1785120	1785640	Let's hope.
1785640	1786120	I think so.
1786120	1788640	Is there a list of baby skills, or are the baby skills,
1788640	1791280	are they assigned at birth, or is it just random?
1791280	1792560	I think you get to pick.
1792560	1793960	I think that's the whole sales pitch,
1793960	1796280	is you get to pick what skills your baby has.
1796280	1800800	Wouldn't every couple pick flights or invisibility?
1800800	1803080	Well, I don't think they're supernatural skills.
1803080	1807520	I think there's skills you could already have as an adult,
1807520	1809240	but your baby could have it.
1809240	1810520	My baby speaks four languages.
1810520	1811920	There you go.
1811920	1813880	That's the kind of baby skills that I can really
1813880	1817120	see happening in the marketplace.
1817120	1818760	But that's dystopic, right?
1818760	1821200	As soon as we open up that jar, we're in trouble, right?
1821200	1821680	True.
1821680	1822640	The jar is kind of open, though.
1822640	1823960	They make goats every day.
1823960	1826720	They make new goats in a lab every day.
1826720	1827800	They're doing that already.
1827800	1830400	They finally did some human cloning in China,
1830400	1832880	I think, recently, which is a benchmark I've always
1832880	1834440	been watching, because I always wanted
1834440	1837240	to be the first person to do a human clone.
1837240	1838560	I'm not a scientist or anything.
1838560	1839920	I just wanted to.
1839920	1840680	Accidentally?
1840680	1841640	Well, no, on purpose.
1841640	1844160	I always wanted to clone myself and just be like, hey,
1844160	1845120	I did it, guys.
1845120	1846040	I'm the clone guy.
1846040	1847920	I'm the guy who cloned humans successfully.
1847920	1849600	Ha ha.
1849600	1852200	Like an instant clone, or would you just be like 60
1852200	1855080	and there would be a 30-year-old Spencer coming out
1855080	1857080	of a Petri dish?
1857080	1859880	I'd give it a couple years and be like, check out this baby.
1859920	1861600	That's me.
1861600	1865000	I bet you're wondering how I got here.
1865000	1868440	And your baby's going to have the unreliable narrator skill.
1868440	1870520	That would be nice.
1870520	1875280	I don't want to pick baby skills.
1875280	1877680	I don't want to either, but somebody will.
1877680	1879280	Yeah, it's going to happen no matter what.
1879280	1881000	It's inevitable.
1881000	1883360	I'm distracted by the thing that you brought up, though,
1883360	1885400	like this idea of being in heaven
1885400	1886840	and then there's this button.
1886840	1890000	And you go, this idea of getting to a point
1890000	1892280	where you're like, I've done it all for real.
1892280	1894480	There's nothing I can experience anymore.
1894480	1898560	And then there's this button that says, started over.
1898560	1899480	Let me be honest here.
1899480	1900720	This was inspired.
1900720	1903080	I just started watching The Good Place,
1903080	1904680	and I just got through the first season.
1904680	1906680	So that kind of happened in there a little bit.
1906680	1908640	That kind of.
1908640	1910920	But it's interesting, because it's like a sci-fi or even
1910920	1914600	a sitcom-y way into thinking about, oh, well,
1914600	1917800	what if the God that made the universe is just like kind of,
1917800	1919960	yeah, it's like, I mean, what's the difference, right?
1919960	1922640	You're just doing this weird thing where you're like, well,
1922640	1924480	it's not going to be fun if I remember anything.
1924480	1926040	And then you're like, pfft.
1926040	1927760	Well, you're going to learn everything, right?
1927760	1930040	Because it's heaven, and it'll be great.
1930040	1932000	If you're going to get fatigued, heaven fatigued.
1932000	1932880	You taught me that.
1932880	1934880	Heaven fatigued.
1934880	1936480	So yeah, that's the cure to heaven fatigues.
1936480	1938680	You push the reset button.
1938680	1939200	Yeah.
1939200	1941840	And you're not tired anymore because you forgot you were tired.
1941840	1945720	In dog heaven, you're saying that it's just dogs, right?
1945720	1946600	It's just dogs.
1946600	1947760	They don't have any buttons.
1947760	1950760	But who's going to throw the ball or do the thing?
1950760	1952680	The ball gets thrown.
1952680	1954040	They don't care who throws the dog.
1954040	1956360	It'd be another giant dog throwing the ball.
1956360	1957240	They don't care.
1957240	1959360	God throws the ball.
1959360	1960440	They don't like us.
1960440	1961120	We think they do.
1961120	1962160	They don't like us.
1962160	1963480	They think we're dogs.
1963480	1966080	Yeah, they think we're like bears, I think.
1966080	1966640	Yeah, they're nice.
1966640	1967640	I think dogs think we're bears.
1967640	1969520	They think we're bears.
1969520	1972680	I think dogs think that we're bears that think they're bears.
1972680	1973480	Right.
1973480	1975120	And they think they're the lucky dog
1975120	1977360	who the bears think they're a bear, too.
1977360	1980320	But that's why dogs all get along, essentially.
1980320	1981920	Some of them are like, fuck you.
1981920	1985080	But I think they're like, don't tell them we're dogs.
1985080	1986880	Right, that's it.
1986880	1987960	You're letting on.
1987960	1990200	But most of them, when they're sniffing each other's butts,
1990200	1992280	that's them going, do they think you're a bear?
1992280	1993240	Yeah, of course they do.
1993240	1994440	Otherwise, they'd be eating us.
1994440	1995840	And they're like, this is what bears do, right?
1995840	1997080	They sniff each other's butts.
1997080	1998080	It's just a show.
1998080	2001680	Because that's the thing in the wild that looks the most like,
2001680	2004880	in a dog's, it's like they were big, hairy,
2004880	2007920	or weird things that go, rah, rah,
2007920	2009720	like walk around on hind legs.
2009720	2013920	And if you fuck with our babies, we'll kill you.
2013920	2016960	And we're always gobbling salmon out of a stream.
2016960	2020480	Yeah, if bears started feeding dogs first,
2020480	2021720	we wouldn't even have dogs.
2021720	2023400	Bears would have dogs.
2023400	2025400	Wait, wait.
2025400	2027760	Yeah.
2028640	2030240	I missed the top of that.
2030240	2032480	If we weren't around, bears would have dogs.
2032480	2035920	No, if bears started feeding dogs first, let's say,
2035920	2037920	bears started sharing your salmon with the dog.
2037920	2039320	We wouldn't even have dogs.
2039320	2041120	But let's say you're walking your dog who
2041120	2046880	thinks you're a bear that didn't eat you because you thought
2046880	2048320	it was a bear, too.
2048320	2050440	Let's say you're walking through Yosemite National Park
2050440	2053200	and a bear goes by.
2053200	2053880	With your dog.
2053880	2056200	You're with your dog in Yosemite and a bear comes by.
2056200	2059560	And the dog would be like, hey, fucking
2059560	2060640	let's hang out with that guy.
2060640	2062960	Well, that's why in bear attacks,
2062960	2065680	the dog never protects the person.
2065680	2068120	They're like, shit, bear war.
2071720	2074000	There's only one loser here and I'm headed for them.
2074000	2077240	I'm grabbing the marshmallows and I'm out of here.
2077240	2079320	This is where my four legs come in handy.
2079320	2080440	I could leg it out of here.
2080440	2084040	I just became an outdoors dog.
2084040	2085760	Commence world's longest walk.
2086760	2089320	OK, another scenario.
2089320	2090520	You're walking your dog.
2090520	2092600	Dan, you're out in Yosemite National Park
2092600	2094240	and you're walking Harvey around.
2094240	2095760	You're golden doodle.
2095760	2098240	And you see a wolf.
2098240	2100400	And what is hard to think about?
2100400	2103040	I mean, you're poking holes in my theory.
2103040	2104040	What about coyotes?
2104040	2106640	I mean, what are they saying?
2106640	2109760	I got coyotes right behind my back wall right now.
2109760	2111200	They're just like right there.
2111200	2112560	I still haven't seen one.
2112560	2116320	My dog sitter saw one when we were out of town.
2116320	2118200	They cross my street all the time in a pack
2118200	2120520	and they come down two different streets
2120520	2122240	because they're surrounding.
2122240	2123600	They're like the sharks in a jet.
2123600	2124640	So they're going to have a rumble.
2124640	2126000	Yeah, coyote rumble.
2126000	2127440	You're never alone.
2127440	2128760	You're never disconnected.
2128760	2130480	But it's so cramp, so cramp.
2130480	2131000	Here's the thing.
2131000	2133920	In my neighborhood, some of the coyotes are Puerto Ricans
2133920	2137920	and some are just white guys from New York.
2137920	2140080	I guess that's true.
2140080	2142440	Like genetically and geographically.
2142960	2144400	I'm doing one side story joke.
2144400	2144920	Oh, I see.
2144920	2145520	It's a musical.
2145520	2146040	Right.
2146040	2147280	Yeah, Sondheim, remember?
2147280	2148520	OK.
2148520	2153600	But they hunt in packs and they all come down this one street
2153600	2156400	down from the convent that I think Katy Perry bought.
2156400	2162840	And they come down this one road and then they all split up.
2162840	2165760	And they all just fan out like the Blue Angels.
2165760	2169000	And then 10 minutes later, you hear the sound
2169000	2170280	of an animal dying.
2170280	2172400	And then you hear a bunch of people screaming.
2172400	2175040	And then I open my window and look out.
2175040	2176960	And you see people just throwing shit
2176960	2179560	at these coyotes who were running off with their animal.
2179560	2181040	Yeah.
2181040	2182920	You can track it like this every time?
2182920	2183400	Huh?
2183400	2183920	Every time.
2183920	2184560	You can track it like this every time.
2184560	2185760	I mean, I've seen it happen.
2185760	2189160	Where I live, Paul Rust and Leslie Arfand, the great TV
2189160	2192520	show creators, their cat got ate.
2192520	2195760	And their dog was traumatized by it and never got over it.
2195760	2197200	Because the dog was giant.
2197200	2198960	The dog's like, you can eat the cat?
2201280	2207440	I've sat here for 11 years taking this thing's shit.
2207440	2209440	Why can't I eat the cat?
2209440	2212040	There's nothing but the dog in me.
2212040	2215480	But yeah, their cat got eaten next door to me.
2215480	2218400	And the sound of it, and then the wailing of the dog going,
2218400	2219240	I'm helpless.
2219240	2221800	I feel like if you keep seeing this happen,
2221800	2223680	where there's this dog procession and then
2223680	2226560	some animal gets murdered, you should warn people.
2226560	2228440	Well, everybody warns each other.
2229320	2232680	I see coyotes all the time coming down my street.
2232680	2235960	And I'll pick up a rock and throw it at them.
2235960	2237880	They're like, get the fuck out of here.
2237880	2239600	But all they do is just fan out.
2239600	2243200	And you just see them like a black ops unit,
2243200	2245920	going through backyards and fucking like, seal team six.
2245920	2248960	You know what their technique is?
2248960	2251000	What I want to know is, what is a dog hearing
2251000	2252000	when they hear a coyote?
2252000	2254120	But you see the dogs go crazy when they hear like this.
2254120	2256200	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
2256200	2257640	The coyotes start doing this thing.
2257720	2263320	But their typical technique is, they'll send one stray coyote.
2263320	2265080	One will start doing this thing.
2265080	2268000	Like, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.
2268000	2269960	And the dogs are like, Mike, do you
2269960	2272200	have sample technology in there?
2272200	2273640	Can we loop his coyote or not?
2273640	2279320	But apparently, they goad dogs into an interaction with one.
2279320	2284320	It's a pretty standard raptor, a clever girl technique.
2285240	2287840	They purposely, like, I think that's the fanning out thing
2287840	2292840	is that they basically like, they do these little trollings.
2292840	2296400	And then any dog that takes the bait and kind of like,
2296400	2299680	is like, fuck, is there a crazy dog over there
2299680	2304160	that I could fucking talk to about being disguised
2304160	2305000	as a bear?
2305000	2309840	And then they just fucking run up and grab
2309840	2311320	that poor little fucker.
2311560	2316240	There's a dementia-addled, half-blind French bulldog
2316240	2319080	that lives up above my wall, where I just
2319080	2321640	hear these coyotes now, and I'm like, I got a broomstick.
2321640	2324200	And I'm like, get out of here!
2324200	2327000	Get out of here, coyotes!
2327000	2330080	I'm going to buy long flannel underwear with a butt flap
2330080	2334520	just to have a cowboy hat with a brim up.
2334520	2337520	Get out, you varmints!
2337520	2339000	You should buy a couple Roadrunners.
2341760	2344280	That attracts them.
2344280	2345720	They self-destruct.
2345720	2348840	But then you can also sell faulty products to the coyotes.
2348840	2349320	Yeah.
2349320	2354360	Well, if I start like styling these catalogs around,
2354360	2359560	like the magnetic boxing glove, they're like,
2359560	2362160	I'm making money hand over fist.
2362160	2366440	I like, once every couple years, have a standoff
2366440	2370480	with a family of skunks that just decide that they live.
2370480	2373560	For charity, this is a charity thing.
2373560	2374680	Where do you live?
2378600	2380480	Las Vegas on stage.
2380480	2383200	He has the worst Vegas stage show.
2383200	2386920	Also, I can make Tiger disappear.
2386920	2389800	Sometimes, just skunks, the whole family, like mama
2389800	2391920	papa and the little babies, and they're adorable.
2391920	2393320	They're so cute.
2393320	2396480	And they'll just be on my front door.
2397480	2399880	It's late at night.
2399880	2401040	Just got home.
2401040	2402080	And I'm looking, and I'm thinking, OK,
2402080	2403440	there's a bunch of skunks just hanging out there.
2403440	2404000	And they see you.
2404000	2406160	And what they don't do is run off like other animals,
2406160	2407200	like squirrels and cats.
2407200	2408080	No.
2408080	2410280	They just look at you, and they're like, what up?
2410280	2414800	They're like, and then if you get close and try to shoo them,
2414800	2418000	the adults put their tails up in the air, which means.
2418000	2420680	And they're like, you know, it actually
2420680	2423000	hurts to walk around with this shit.
2423000	2426040	Give me a reason.
2426080	2427400	It's burning my tail.
2427400	2430400	I think it stinks, too.
2430400	2433680	Look at me sideways.
2433680	2439200	Like, just infringe upon my ancient pact
2439200	2443360	with the druids that founded Los Feliz.
2443360	2448000	They have like a millennial old pagan ceasefire.
2448000	2449600	I don't have a chip on my shoulder.
2449600	2451880	I have a chip on my butt that I can't wait
2451880	2453560	to fucking fire at you.
2453560	2456320	Did you ever see, like in the nature document,
2456320	2459400	where they show like a skunk in high speed super slow-mo,
2459400	2460680	like a skunk spraying?
2460680	2462120	It's so gross.
2462120	2463040	Super disgusting.
2463040	2464920	It's like snot coming out.
2464920	2466840	It's like, you know, it's just like, it's not.
2466840	2470240	It doesn't like, oh, stinky spray or like Fred Flintstone
2470240	2470840	vapor.
2470840	2474800	It's like grody, nasty fucking Peter North gross.
2474800	2482000	We're pretty fortunate that only one animal got that
2482000	2483400	as a defense mechanism.
2483400	2485760	Oh my god, yeah.
2485760	2487040	It is crazy.
2487040	2490520	There's only like a handful of ways to protect yourself.
2490520	2494400	There could be birds that project how shit at you.
2494400	2498280	I got pooped in the mouth.
2498280	2500360	All right, moving on.
2500360	2502920	I was walking down the road.
2502920	2506000	Walking down the road.
2506000	2511720	Fucking midday downtown Los Angeles.
2511720	2512920	Gonna go get my car.
2512920	2514720	Everything was groovy.
2514720	2517120	And I see a flight of little birds,
2517120	2519640	like small little sparrow swallow-sized birds,
2519640	2521040	little birds.
2521040	2524120	And I see like a little hoplite of fucking birds coming at me.
2524120	2526280	And they're going to go up into a tree.
2526280	2527440	And I see one bird.
2527440	2531360	And I don't want to over-dramatize this.
2531360	2535800	But I'm pretty sure this bird made eye contact with me.
2535800	2537760	From the distance that Spencer is for me,
2537760	2539920	but about 10 feet higher.
2539920	2544400	I came down with the rest of the birds, broke fucking ranks,
2544400	2548360	like feathered off of that one, and fucking pooped
2548360	2550560	like about five feet in the air.
2550560	2551960	And it went right in my mouth.
2551960	2555240	Like it judged the fucking trajectory
2555240	2558040	like an 83 in television games.
2558040	2559080	No, no.
2559080	2562520	It was like fucking Iron Eagle.
2562520	2565640	He just fired a missile of little baby bird poop.
2565640	2567800	It wasn't like a big seagull turd.
2567800	2569880	It wasn't like a big giant thing.
2570840	2573360	The bird flew at me and just dropped one about four feet
2573360	2573960	away.
2573960	2577920	But because of inertia, that the poop leaving the bird
2577920	2580960	is going to carry the same speed for the first few feet.
2580960	2583600	It landed right in my bottom lip.
2583600	2586040	My mouth was closed, but it went ugh.
2586040	2586840	It went right there.
2586840	2588320	I'm like, motherfucker.
2588320	2591040	And that bird knew exactly what was happening.
2591040	2592160	What is it with birds?
2592160	2594120	Shit, you know, it's really gross.
2594120	2597560	It would be one thing if it was either turds, like hamster
2597560	2602600	turds, or just glaps of white goo.
2602600	2603680	You know what's weird about it?
2603680	2604160	It's both.
2604160	2604920	That's so gross.
2604920	2609080	And the other supernatural properties of bird poop,
2609080	2615040	it's like it's black on white stuff and white on black stuff
2615040	2616440	with the same bird butt.
2616440	2617920	That doesn't even make sense.
2617920	2618800	What do you mean?
2618800	2622840	Because in large poop, like pigeon poop,
2622840	2625240	I may be wrong about this because my avian knowledge is
2625240	2626200	not where it ought to be.
2626200	2627120	Oh, I see what you're saying.
2627440	2630360	It's like a reverse chameleon, like you've adapted.
2630360	2632720	Just let everyone know where our shit is.
2632720	2634880	They've mastered a contrast.
2634880	2637040	The brown part is the feces, and the white part,
2637040	2639720	or the lighter kind of stuff, is the urine.
2639720	2642960	So that bird probably peed in my mouth.
2642960	2646400	Birds, you're gross.
2646400	2649960	If there are any birds that listen to the podcast,
2649960	2652440	OK, your bones are hollow, so it's not
2652440	2653600	impressive that you can fly.
2653600	2655160	Dan, we have it.
2655160	2656760	I could fly too if I had hollow bones.
2657360	2658320	And I don't want them.
2658320	2659200	I don't care.
2659200	2660320	I can get on a plane.
2660320	2662560	I don't want to do that either.
2662560	2663360	I hate planes.
2663360	2665120	You're offending open mic eagle, right?
2665120	2667400	No, no, no, it's just a name.
2667400	2672480	I have no emotional connection to it at all at all.
2672480	2677360	I do want to remind everyone that this whole moment was
2677360	2680640	started with you saying, I got pooped in the mouth.
2680640	2682480	He was all enthusiastic about it.
2682480	2685480	I got pooped in the mouth.
2686320	2689400	Don't mistake my enthusiasm for outrage, Dan.
2689400	2693880	The birds were going off to my left,
2693880	2696680	and one broke ranks and fired a poop in my mouth.
2696680	2697920	Or maybe pee.
2697920	2700520	I don't know, but all I know is it's good luck.
2700520	2702120	When did this happen?
2702120	2702960	When did this happen?
2702960	2703440	This happened.
2703440	2705720	Church, are you still here?
2705720	2707360	She fucked off.
2707360	2709080	It was like two weeks ago.
2709080	2711280	Is this the first you're telling other people of this?
2711280	2713080	I told her.
2713080	2714360	I just got pooped in the mouth.
2715480	2722480	Is it fair to blame this on the government shutdown?
2722480	2726640	Like that wouldn't happen if there was 800,000 people
2726640	2728440	getting paid to work.
2728440	2730000	They regulate this stuff.
2730000	2732160	OK, maybe it was longer.
2732160	2734520	I feel like it was pretty shut down.
2734520	2735160	I don't know.
2735160	2737640	Look, the timeline's not important.
2737640	2740240	What matters is I got pooped in the mouth.
2740240	2742040	Birds are savage creatures.
2742040	2744840	When my brother got married, we had a bachelor party
2744840	2748000	in Balboa, Newport Beach, California.
2748000	2749760	And we all went out the next morning
2749760	2754680	to have a bloody marriage, a cool old dive bar in Balboa.
2754680	2756160	And we're hanging out.
2756160	2759160	And my brother's friend, Bren, is a college buddy.
2759160	2761680	He's the most mellow surfer dude.
2761680	2762680	He's like Matthew McConaughey.
2762680	2764680	He's like, yeah, man, everything's cool.
2764680	2767240	He's just one of those guys who's super laid back.
2767240	2770640	And he goes out to have a cigarette and comes back in.
2770640	2774160	I've never seen him look worried or bummed out.
2774160	2775080	And he comes back in.
2775080	2777840	And he's just walking as fast as you can walk
2777840	2781040	without running into the bathroom.
2781040	2782160	And then he comes back in.
2782160	2783000	And he sits down next to him.
2783000	2784240	And he picks up his buddy, Mary.
2784240	2786760	And he's all like, oh, fuck, man.
2786760	2788000	I'm like, Bren, what happened?
2788000	2794440	And he goes, I'm going to try to say this without laughing.
2794440	2799720	He said, bird pulled a deuce on my bean.
2799720	2803240	A bird pulled a deuce on my bean.
2803240	2804760	That's the way, if you're a surfer guy,
2804760	2807640	you say a bird shit on my head.
2807640	2808760	See Australian?
2808760	2809800	No.
2809800	2813360	I can't say a bird pulled a deuce on my bean.
2813360	2815360	Mate.
2815360	2817480	He's a mate after it.
2817480	2818800	Let's make some music, shall we?
2818800	2820640	Can I say one more word, bird thing?
2820640	2821920	Just before we put this in.
2821920	2822440	I don't mind.
2822440	2824760	I mean, look, I got a couple more animal things.
2824760	2825520	Go ahead.
2825520	2830240	So it was raining a lot here in the last week or so.
2830240	2831600	And I was riding around with my kid.
2831600	2834960	And my kid goes, I feel bad for the birds.
2834960	2836920	It's going to fly around on his brain.
2836920	2840080	A little open falcon eagle.
2840080	2840560	That's close.
2840560	2841360	Wait, no.
2841360	2841960	Open shit.
2841960	2842560	Never mind.
2842560	2843040	That's close.
2843040	2845680	I was trying to riff your son's name.
2845680	2847040	Almost did.
2847040	2848680	Open Kevin Sparrow.
2848680	2849180	Kevin.
2849180	2849680	Kevin.
2853680	2857200	Well, Kevin turns to me and he says, well, no, yeah.
2857200	2861040	He says, he felt bad for the birds.
2861040	2862720	And I was like, they're OK.
2866000	2869520	You're driving like, yeah, that's exactly what I was doing.
2869520	2870520	You're almost mad at them.
2870520	2872600	Because in my heart, I was like, they are OK.
2872600	2876000	But then he asked me why I had no answer whatsoever.
2876000	2877440	Why are the birds OK?
2877440	2878640	Are they OK?
2878640	2879680	Should we be concerned?
2879680	2880960	There should be sanctuaries.
2880960	2884440	Well, if they weren't OK, wouldn't the ground
2884440	2885920	be covered with them?
2885920	2887360	But then he starts crying.
2887360	2889240	This is the confidence I had.
2889240	2890640	But I also had no reason.
2890640	2892520	Do you ever watch the David Attenborough,
2892520	2893640	The Life of Birds thing?
2893640	2895720	Like, it's like the planet Earth kind of stuff.
2895720	2897040	It's called The Life of Birds.
2897040	2899040	And I think there's like six or eight episodes.
2899040	2900480	It's so good.
2900480	2903280	It's just his British dating tips.
2906280	2908000	Oh, look at that bird over there.
2908000	2909000	The knife of the bird's hand.
2909000	2911280	I fuck her like to watch her flap around your fucking head.
2911280	2912600	She knows what she's doing.
2912600	2914920	Fucking hell, look at that fucking bird.
2916920	2920360	You're like, boy, you drink bird, you fucking little fucker.
2920360	2921520	Offer her a fag.
2921520	2922320	Yeah.
2922320	2924480	No, but there's one that's just about the technology
2924480	2925400	of feathers.
2925400	2927440	And the reason why they don't fucking have to worry
2927440	2930600	about it is the feathers are like this Klingon cloaking
2930600	2931480	device for water.
2931480	2932200	Like, they just.
2932200	2934920	I almost said some bullshit like feather technology,
2934920	2936120	but I couldn't back it up.
2936120	2938320	Also, and you also said you would see birds
2938320	2939200	all over the ground.
2939200	2942560	You'd almost never see a dead bird in the ground.
2942560	2945560	Like, maybe a few times in your life, you'll see like a, oh,
2945600	2946480	shit, there's a dead bird.
2946480	2947520	It is weird.
2947520	2950160	The reason why you don't is because they're instantly
2950160	2951240	eaten by other things.
2951240	2953520	And because they're so light, because the bones are hollow
2953520	2956360	and they're made of feathers, they blow away.
2956360	2960320	Yeah, I bet the feather in the Forrest Gump
2960320	2963920	is probably recently.
2963920	2967400	Also, that feather killed Archduke Ferdinand
2967400	2970360	to start the World War I.
2970360	2973120	That's how fucking rich the history of Forrest Gump is.
2973120	2976760	Before, and when it did, like someone was like, whoa,
2976760	2979040	feather, why did you do that?
2979040	2979920	Think different.
2979920	2981120	Yeah.
2981120	2981920	That's great.
2981920	2982840	We should use that.
2982840	2986120	And that chocolate box was made out of the lunar lander.
2986120	2988360	How old is Kevin Sparrow?
2988360	2990240	He just turned 10.
2990240	2993200	That's sort of, I mean, that's got to be amazing, right?
2993200	2995320	I would love to have a 10-year-old.
2995320	2997520	I don't want anything, well, almost anything else.
2997520	2998480	I hear you.
2998480	3000240	Because I remember being 10.
3000240	3002640	That's going to go mimetic tomorrow.
3002680	3004920	You're two years from him chesting up on you.
3004920	3006520	Right, no, it's going to happen, for sure.
3006520	3008280	He's trying to be like, you're going to be like,
3008280	3009720	why does that get an eye roll?
3009720	3011240	All I said was good morning.
3011240	3014880	Yeah, in any way he can, he tries to dominate me now.
3014880	3016120	He just can't, because he's 10.
3016120	3017720	But when he's 12, it'll be different.
3017720	3021080	I mean, the 10-year-olds, first of all, they play Minecraft.
3021080	3023760	So I'm just like, mm.
3023760	3029360	But then they just love to just talk about lists of shit.
3029360	3031800	They're like, Dilapisaurus is another crap.
3032760	3034400	And I'm just like, this is something
3034400	3037680	that's more interesting than credit cards.
3037680	3041760	Is your son a skilled baby?
3041760	3044280	I don't think so.
3044280	3046800	I think we've taught him everything he knows.
3046800	3048720	Either that or somebody else has.
3048720	3050400	What's your relationship?
3050400	3051640	Are you guys pals, or?
3051640	3053800	Yeah, we're pretty cool.
3053800	3055080	We are.
3055080	3056600	We have some shared interests.
3056600	3058200	That was a measured response.
3058200	3061280	Yeah, because I think it's a complicated answer, probably.
3061280	3062840	Sometimes I think maybe he's just
3062840	3064960	hanging around because he's legally obligated to.
3068080	3069480	That's what it sounded like.
3069480	3071600	We went to the zoo the other day and I'm like,
3071600	3076160	I felt like it was kind of a mutual.
3076160	3078160	I love him, all right?
3078160	3079800	My question, I guess what I'm asking
3079800	3082040	is, do you like him as a person?
3082040	3084920	Oh, I like him a lot.
3084920	3087640	He is 10, though.
3087640	3089120	So he can be a pain in the ass.
3089120	3090640	Oh, my god, yes.
3090640	3092800	But in cute ways, most of the time.
3092800	3094360	Is he gangly?
3094360	3096200	First of all, is he listening?
3096200	3097440	No, he hates podcasts.
3097440	3099840	OK, he's not allowed to listen to this one.
3099840	3102000	But is he getting gangly?
3102000	3104560	Yeah, he is.
3104560	3107120	He's the tall, skinny version of his toddler self,
3107120	3108280	which is weird.
3108280	3110320	But he's not quite like a teenager yet.
3110320	3114800	He's just a long, small child.
3114800	3116400	I see pictures of myself around that age.
3116400	3118880	I'm like, ugh, it could start saying, yeah,
3118880	3126160	I don't think our human brains are designed to adorableize
3126160	3128920	the day-to-day transition, where it's like,
3128920	3131240	this is the gangly period, where we're like, ugh,
3131240	3132440	will you just pick a lane?
3132440	3135000	You know what I notice about him, too?
3135000	3136680	Because he's constantly growing.
3136680	3138840	We're having to buy shoes and shit all the time.
3138840	3140920	He grows out of everything.
3140920	3142960	His pants always get short.
3142960	3145360	He's wearing the same shirt he was wearing when he was five.
3145360	3146240	I swear to God.
3146240	3148040	It's like his legs get long with his torso.
3148720	3150680	He's going to be tall, then.
3150680	3151400	Maybe.
3151400	3152720	Maybe that's all children.
3152720	3153720	I saw him.
3153720	3156360	When I was 10, I was really short.
3156360	3160800	But my shoes were really outside.
3160800	3163920	I looked like I was skiing all the time.
3163920	3166440	And I made a lot of noise walking around.
3166440	3170080	I was skinny and short with big-ass feet.
3170080	3170800	That's all of them.
3170800	3174440	I saw a British documentary about puberty.
3174440	3175960	Is it David Attenborough?
3175960	3177920	I don't know.
3178680	3181560	I bought it in Times Square from some guy in a raincoat.
3181560	3185360	No, it was really cool.
3185360	3186800	I can't remember what it was called.
3186800	3187720	I saw it years ago.
3187720	3194920	But it was like, they take you through a boy and a girl.
3194920	3197360	Both are going through these changes.
3200200	3204200	They live next door to each other in this little town.
3204200	3206200	And then they go to school together.
3206200	3209400	And then it's like, they walk you through puberty.
3209400	3214000	And including the fact that the boy, his brain chemistry
3214000	3215080	is starting to change.
3215080	3221520	And so thoughts of he starts scuffling with other boys.
3221520	3225680	I was just talking about all of this weird biochemical shit.
3225680	3229240	One of the things that they said was, both of them,
3229240	3233000	as they're going to bed at night,
3233000	3237080	when shit kicks in, literally overnight,
3237080	3238200	these changes are happening.
3238200	3239680	And I think they said, if you were
3239680	3244000	able to somehow, without being a villain in maybe
3244000	3247320	a Eli Roth movie, if you were able to focus in
3247320	3250960	on the leg bones of a kid at that age,
3250960	3255800	you could see with the naked eye the growth happening.
3255800	3260200	That's how fast bones are lengthening and shit.
3260200	3263480	They wake up and they're like a quarter inch taller.
3263480	3264840	I wonder if you could hear it.
3264840	3266240	Does it sound like a tree?
3266240	3272400	Does your son like, I'm going to write a book about you.
3275400	3279560	No matter what, Mike, does your son listen to your music?
3279560	3281240	Do you play music with him?
3281240	3283920	He used to like my music.
3283920	3284960	He like your old shit.
3284960	3287400	Well, yeah, he's a hip hip.
3287480	3292520	No, we programmed him with all this independent alt-rap shit.
3292520	3295440	And then he like heard Drake for the first time.
3295440	3296600	And now he wants.
3296600	3297360	You lost him?
3297360	3298120	We lost him.
3298120	3299440	I mean, we lost him for a while.
3299440	3300440	This is his rebellion.
3300440	3303320	He likes to hear the hi-hats.
3303320	3306400	That's what he's into, you know?
3306400	3307360	That's amazing.
3307360	3308480	That's all about the mixing.
3308480	3311160	Is he musical, or is he going to fall off?
3311160	3311840	He raps.
3311840	3312840	He raps a lot.
3312840	3314440	He raps himself to sleep every night.
3314440	3315760	Does he write or freestyle?
3315760	3316600	Only freestyles.
3316600	3318000	He will not write a ram.
3318000	3318800	Oh, shit.
3318800	3321520	He won't write a ram, or we're going to ask, is he good?
3321520	3323040	He is pretty good.
3323040	3325000	He used to like not use words.
3325000	3326040	So that was bad.
3326040	3328520	Like he would just freestyle syllables.
3328520	3331000	Yeah, he would just make up enough syllables to get to it.
3331000	3332760	Dab-a-dab-a-dab-a-dab-a-dab-a-dab.
3332760	3333600	It's scam.
3333600	3335320	Ella Fitzgerald had a career out of it.
3335320	3336200	That's true.
3336200	3338360	But those were choices.
3338360	3340920	He wasn't making choices.
3340920	3341840	He's just fudging it.
3341840	3343240	He's just kind of like.
3343240	3346080	It's camadabadab-a-flib-a-dab-boop.
3346080	3347640	Oh, that reminds me, too.
3347640	3350920	He loves to make fun of 80s rap.
3350920	3351440	Oh, yeah?
3351440	3352360	Just like that.
3352360	3352840	Right.
3352840	3354440	He'd be like, what is 80s rap sound?
3354440	3357640	He'd be like, he would even die in a Papa Dabata.
3357640	3359160	And I'm like, yeah, you're right.
3359160	3359800	That's it.
3360760	3362080	That's not a little fast.
3362080	3362960	That was a little fast.
3362960	3363280	You're right.
3363280	3364280	Does he know 80s rap?
3364280	3365960	Like, he knows run to the theater?
3365960	3368440	Look, I've steeped him in rap.
3368440	3370320	So now he has these refined tastes where
3370320	3371400	he knows what to hate on.
3371400	3375320	But you say now he's into more poppy, like bigger,
3375320	3376320	like produced stuff.
3376320	3379520	He likes relevance, like most people.
3379520	3380280	That's why it's called pop.
3380280	3381160	It's popular.
3381160	3383720	What do we think Martin Luther King, Jr.
3383720	3387240	Do we think he would have been a hip-hop fan?
3387240	3388840	Would he have been like a crotchety?
3388880	3390640	Would he have been like, I have a dream
3390640	3393160	that you're turning that down.
3393160	3397800	Or would Ella Fitzgerald, or would he be like, this is the.
3397800	3399440	No, he would have been very disappointing.
3399440	3400760	Yeah, he would have hated rap.
3400760	3403720	Just because it's not, because you think he was,
3403720	3407560	probably because it's like, I mean, because it's like,
3407560	3411480	oh, you should be, his definition of championship
3411480	3413960	was like, you're going to a school that has music classes,
3413960	3415400	and you're playing an instrument,
3415400	3418400	and you're conquering the system.
3418400	3420840	His idea of rebellious music would be like,
3420840	3422960	blues music with curse words.
3422960	3424600	You know what I mean?
3424600	3427240	Like rap would be just straight obscene to him.
3427240	3430760	But also, at that time of his life,
3430760	3433200	up in Harlem, the jazz clubs and stuff like that,
3433200	3436200	that's where that culture of music.
3436200	3437520	That was the dangerous part of town,
3437520	3439360	where they played an upright bass.
3439360	3440000	Yeah.
3440000	3441760	Yeah, he didn't actually.
3441760	3445000	I mean, he always thought, oh, just keep moving forward,
3445000	3445920	keep moving forward.
3445920	3449240	And he didn't know, yeah, god, I mean,
3449240	3454120	he would have wept had he known the Harlem Renaissance
3454120	3457800	and the counter-targeting and what it resulted in.
3457800	3459440	I think if you explained it all to him,
3459440	3462120	then he would be a hip-hop fan, because he'd be like,
3462120	3464600	well, when you put it that way, because it's basically like,
3464600	3467000	oh, you can't have music funding,
3467000	3469160	you can't have an instrument, you can't go to things.
3469160	3471000	And then it's like, well, then fuck you.
3471000	3473760	So if he read the hip-hop Wikipedia page.
3473760	3476320	Right, if he read as much about hip-hop
3476320	3478680	as I did about him an hour ago, I
3478680	3481480	think he'd be a smart enough guy to be like, OK, well,
3481480	3482880	then you've got to like.
3482880	3484120	But I think he'd be really.
3484120	3485120	I'm sorry, Dan, go ahead.
3485120	3487320	No, I probably don't have to finish.
3487320	3489560	I just thought, I think he'd be really bummed out
3489560	3493040	that there was like, oh, shit, there was a counter-punch.
3493040	3494240	Because it wasn't there.
3494240	3495360	Yeah, there was a huge one.
3495360	3498120	I mean, it was like, the 80s were like, no, fuck.
3498120	3500000	It was like, boom.
3500000	3502680	Right when I was a kid and I was not conscious of it,
3502680	3505480	but then in the 2000s, it's like,
3505480	3506800	then we're learning about it.
3506800	3508640	I mean, I think it was really in the 70s.
3508640	3512440	I think if you look at COINTELPRO specifically, which
3512440	3514360	was like an official FBI program,
3514360	3519920	it was like sent to destroy black uprisings, basically.
3519920	3523400	And a lot of it was with crack cocaine and with heroin
3523400	3526120	and just stuff that was funneled into communities
3526120	3528880	because they knew that it would destroy people.
3528880	3531640	And if nothing else, if you can attach a drug
3531640	3533600	to a population, then there's always
3533600	3535800	a reason to throw them in jail whenever you see them.
3535800	3537200	Also, yeah, you turn around and make
3537200	3539720	the laws that are more specifically punitive
3539720	3542440	towards the things you've introduced into the community.
3542440	3544240	It's a lot.
3544240	3546440	And it created a generation gap.
3546440	3551920	And a lot of that is part of why the ruder parts of rap music
3551920	3552840	are like they are.
3552840	3557360	Because this is a generation of people who lost parents.
3557360	3559320	When you see a crackhead or hear about a crackhead,
3559320	3560560	that's somebody's mom.
3560640	3562640	Then they just weren't around because crack
3562640	3563800	was more important to them.
3563800	3565880	Yeah, when I was in high school, I was like, all of a sudden,
3565880	3567760	all the white guys were in the locker room
3567760	3570720	were like, we're reciting the EZE lyrics.
3570720	3572320	It was like this thing was happening.
3572320	3577480	It was the double irony of, oh, hip hop has gone full nihilism.
3577480	3580760	But at the same time, now white people love it.
3580760	3582960	So now it's worth money, et cetera.
3582960	3585200	Like, it was just fucking weird.
3585200	3586240	Let's solve it tonight.
3586240	3586840	Let's figure it out.
3586840	3588240	Where do you think that's at now?
3588240	3592320	Obviously, like, let's see what we're going to do.
3597320	3599000	Mike, when you're writing your music,
3599000	3602320	because your stuff is poetic and funny.
3602320	3609080	And from what I've heard, you just keep moving and talking.
3609080	3610280	Are you talking to yourself?
3610280	3612200	Are you talking to an audience?
3612200	3614520	When you're writing your stuff, are you writing just
3614520	3615800	to get stuff out?
3615800	3620880	Or are you trying to tell a story to somebody else,
3620880	3623560	or are you just talking about the stuff in your head?
3623560	3627960	I think I am trying to entertain,
3627960	3630720	but I'm starting with trying to entertain myself.
3630720	3632240	So I think I'm filtering what I want
3632240	3636280	to say to other people via what amuses me, mostly.
3636280	3638160	And I think that's kind of what it looks like.
3638160	3640520	Do you think the emo rap thing, like,
3640520	3642640	we probably talked about this last time, maybe,
3642640	3643640	and I was blackout drunk.
3644120	3648800	But to me, it's like, from what I hear, I'm like, oh,
3648800	3654320	that's kind of cool, at least, the rappers
3654320	3656440	that are grinding their jaws and going like,
3656440	3658760	I'm so fucking high, I'm pills.
3658760	3660520	And no one's calling me back.
3663120	3665360	That it's like, the more, like, that's.
3665360	3668760	I smell the hit.
3668760	3673480	I mean, I don't know.
3674440	3680080	To me, I was like, oh, good.
3680080	3690880	That feels like one iteration less healthy, maybe,
3690880	3693760	than being like, here's how it is.
3693760	3696680	And I'm resigned to, I don't know, it's like,
3696680	3699400	I statements and exploring depression
3699400	3708280	seems like a cooler thing than being almost tricked
3708280	3714200	into celebrating criminalization.
3714200	3718760	Exploring addiction and co-dependence and loneliness
3718760	3721720	and alienation is like, oh, we're starting
3721720	3726440	to meet in the middle here, because white America is now
3726440	3727720	all opiated out.
3727720	3732240	And at least we can all just be like, yo, fuck that.
3732240	3734520	I want to buy Nintendo.
3734520	3737200	Yeah, and I think that's exactly where it gets hazy, right?
3737200	3740080	Because music is a huge business.
3740080	3744160	So something that might have genuine worth for us
3744160	3747960	psychologically or emotionally is quickly co-opted
3747960	3751920	and figured out, marketed in a way that becomes dangerous.
3751920	3755280	So you don't necessarily just get the benefit.
3755280	3759240	But I think that's like selling art, basically.
3759240	3763040	You just have to contend with those sorts of things.
3763040	3764160	Fun stuff, huh?
3764160	3767600	When you're writing, just like a writing question,
3767600	3771560	when you're making stuff, do you just sit down, pen and paper
3771560	3773320	and write or type?
3773320	3776200	Or are you just freestyling your head and say, oh, that's good.
3776200	3777040	I'm going to put that in.
3777040	3777600	No, I write.
3777600	3778280	I write a lot.
3778280	3778760	I write.
3778760	3780560	I rewrite all of that.
3780560	3782040	So it's actual pen to paper.
3782040	3783040	Well, it used to be pen to paper.
3783040	3783720	Now I'm typing.
3783720	3784280	I hate it.
3784280	3785920	But I do it because I'm lazy.
3785920	3786520	Same thing.
3786520	3787640	Yeah.
3787640	3789200	You got to keep up with your kid, too.
3789200	3789840	That's true.
3789840	3793560	If you use a pen, he's going to fucking swallow you up.
3793560	3796280	That's true.
3796280	3798480	Your son thinks you're a bear, by the way.
3798480	3800200	He does.
3800200	3801400	We produce some stuff.
3801400	3804880	I like, because we do.
3804880	3809720	It started with Starburn's audio wanting
3809720	3814320	to put out a tape of just the.
3814320	3815000	The rapping.
3815000	3818600	The rapping from the podcast, just the raw record,
3818600	3820440	just the clips, which you can hear for free
3820440	3822920	if you just listen to the podcast and stuff and the audio
3822920	3824400	is whatever it is.
3824400	3827680	And I think it was me going, well,
3827680	3829520	if you're going to sell it to people,
3829520	3834280	can we do a B side where we bother to take the raps
3834280	3836840	and rerecord them?
3836840	3839560	And then we had to have this whole conversation where
3840280	3843640	is our job to make them good?
3843640	3845680	Because then you change everything.
3845680	3851160	Or when you're restoring a painting from the Renaissance,
3851160	3852720	but it ain't from the Renaissance.
3852720	3857240	It's from a horrible show in Denver.
3857240	3861280	But it's sort of like we recorded a bunch of stuff.
3861280	3862400	We did.
3862400	3866440	Yeah, a lot of you, what we decided to do
3866440	3869160	was kind of repeat your process from here.
3869760	3870960	You just rap, that's what you do.
3870960	3873840	We don't need to sit and try to craft
3873840	3875640	a bunch of perfect rap songs.
3875640	3878200	The essential Dan Harmon rap experience
3878200	3880680	is him just fucking rapping, right?
3880680	3881880	You guys have heard that, I'm sure.
3881880	3882760	That's true.
3882760	3884480	It couldn't be more genuine.
3884480	3885800	We heard it today.
3885800	3887920	Yeah, that's what I thought I heard a little bit of it.
3887920	3889640	I mean, a little goes a long way.
3889640	3891880	I like it.
3891880	3894680	So we have a bunch of songs that we made.
3894680	3897520	You would rap and rap and rap and rap,
3897840	3900600	and we would kind of craft these songs
3900600	3902840	based off of what you did.
3902840	3903680	I did bring some to play.
3903680	3905120	Should we play some?
3905120	3905960	I think we should.
3905960	3906800	Because we haven't.
3906800	3907640	Cool.
3907640	3908480	Cool.
3909480	3912800	Like Simon Orre from Starbirds kind of went through
3912800	3916040	initially and pulled out all of the times.
3916040	3917920	It was like rapping.
3917920	3921080	The ones that stick out are Apologies to Denver.
3921080	3922520	That's a good one.
3922520	3925760	What's the one that's Funky Horns?
3925760	3926760	Funky Horns is dope.
3926760	3928560	Funky Horns.
3928560	3929680	Funky Horns is tight.
3929680	3934680	I really like the song dedicated to Mark Maron.
3935360	3937040	That's probably my favorite one.
3937040	3939360	The Funky Horns that we have, the one we always play?
3939360	3940960	Oh, you know the horns.
3940960	3942960	I think the horns were playing when I came out here.
3942960	3943800	I think.
3943800	3947480	The Funky Horns.
3947480	3948840	Okay, so you know what?
3948840	3950200	That's what we're gonna do.
3950200	3951520	We're gonna play Funky Horns.
3951520	3952360	Right.
3952360	3956120	We're gonna play Dan Harmon's rap version of Funky Horns.
3956120	3958000	Do you guys in the studio or on stage during the show?
3958000	3959560	This is the studio, folks.
3959560	3961120	This is the world premiere.
3961120	3963120	This is deep in the lab.
3963120	3963960	This is the world premiere.
3963960	3964800	Oh yeah.
3964800	3965640	This is professional shit.
3965640	3967760	I don't think y'all's buttholes are clenched tight enough.
3967760	3969120	Okay?
3969120	3971160	They're not, I can see, right?
3971160	3972720	This is high stakes shit.
3972720	3973560	This is.
3973560	3976600	This is like, there's gonna be beefs and feuds.
3976600	3978600	Well, we're gonna get to that.
3978600	3980040	We're gonna start with Funky Horns.
3980040	3981480	Oh yeah.
3981480	3983040	Them beefs and feuds.
3983040	3984400	Uh-oh.
3984400	3987760	Let's bring those Funky Horns.
3987760	3990480	Yeah, Funky Horns is the name of this track.
3990480	3992320	You named it once and you never looked back.
3992320	3994680	Ryan Elder is the man, put all this shit together.
3994680	3997480	He's a genius on the couch and the genius on the leather.
3997480	3999160	Now I'm gonna use my privilege to rap.
3999160	4001400	I'm gonna waste your time and rap just like that.
4001400	4003840	I'm gonna be fat and 44 years old
4003840	4007160	and I'm gonna blow my ass into a microphone cord
4007160	4008480	and fucking waste your time.
4008480	4010560	Just a fucking big fat white dude
4010560	4012960	and fucking just talking shit into a microphone
4012960	4015720	because he can pay himself to do whatever the fuck he wants.
4015720	4017400	Rick and Marty, I created.
4017400	4020200	Rick and, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick and Marty.
4020200	4023720	A million dollars a season, a million dollars a season.
4023720	4024840	Didn't earn it.
4024840	4026520	Funky Horns is the name of this track.
4026520	4029960	I'm gonna make this rap up because my crap is gold.
4029960	4031120	I don't do what I'm told.
4031120	4032360	I get fired from every job
4032360	4034160	but it doesn't make me less bold.
4034160	4036000	I came, I saw, I fucked.
4036000	4038560	Vini, Vini, Vini, your mom said shucks.
4038560	4040880	Bunch your mama with my understanding.
4040880	4043160	I fucked your mama like it was not landing.
4043160	4045360	Funky Horns is the name of this track.
4045360	4047160	I'm gonna do an improvised rap.
4047160	4049680	I'm a big fat blowhard with lots of privilege.
4049680	4050800	I fucked your mama so hard
4050800	4054040	there was some shrivelage of her vulva.
4054040	4056320	But it was from pleasure, I assure you.
4056320	4057600	She wasn't going out.
4057600	4058760	It hurt. I was abused.
4058760	4061880	She was saying my pussy got adequately used.
4061880	4063240	I got inside the depths.
4063240	4064680	I plumbed it inside and out.
4064680	4065640	She needed a rest
4065640	4069480	and she was having a tremendous amount of satisfaction
4069480	4070280	with my action.
4070280	4072760	Rhyme's gonna be predictable, but so can you.
4072760	4075200	If you don't like fucking my mama, what you gonna do?
4075200	4076040	You can't fuck my mama.
4076040	4077400	I fucked that up.
4077400	4078360	My mama's dead.
4078360	4079760	Why you bring her up?
4079760	4081560	Fucking insensitive prick.
4081560	4082760	My mom's fucking dead.
4082760	4084400	Breast cancer, number one killer of women.
4084400	4085240	Piece of shit.
4086160	4087000	Light a can.
4087000	4088560	All right, here we go.
4088560	4089560	Funky Horns.
4091960	4093400	Dan Harmon, everybody.
4093400	4094240	That's a...
4094240	4095080	Yeah.
4097080	4098960	But that's really opened my giggle
4099440	4101240	as a hip-hop producer.
4101240	4103880	Because, yeah, I mean, the thing is like,
4103880	4106760	it's like a different split between like,
4106760	4110560	it's not, I mean, I was like, I did a bunch of shit.
4110560	4113160	You were like a genius about it
4113160	4114720	because like it brought you in.
4114720	4118040	It wasn't a job that you were like, I have an idea.
4118040	4120160	We were like, what if we tried to do this?
4120160	4121120	How would you do it?
4121120	4124520	And you approached it like, oh, well,
4124520	4128160	if you're making a statue, like get the slab of marble
4128200	4129960	in there, I think kind of, and you just did this
4129960	4133640	bare amount of like chiseling.
4133640	4135680	It's not like, it doesn't make me a good rapper.
4135680	4138760	It's not like edited to the point of anything.
4138760	4140560	I think you made some good songs though.
4140560	4145560	I think you made, I think a lot of people
4146120	4150480	that don't have any business rapping make albums, right?
4150480	4154120	But you actually rap all the time.
4154120	4157160	And so like, you have this like relationship
4157160	4158560	to the craft of rapping.
4158560	4160960	There's really uniquely interesting.
4160960	4163240	And I think that like in everything that we did,
4163240	4166680	we can kind of distill like, oh, this is the painting
4166680	4167840	you were painting.
4167840	4170200	And we kind of like this, you know, this is the joint.
4170200	4171880	Yeah, this is an interesting process.
4171880	4174080	Like talking about like, whoa, what happened?
4174080	4177800	So you got drunk in Maryland and you did this rap,
4177800	4180760	but it like turned into, like apologies to Denver,
4180760	4185760	like I think it's interesting because it's just a recreation
4186120	4188880	of a rap that happened in Denver.
4188880	4192400	And it was like, all we were really doing
4192400	4196360	is kind of reproducing it word for word, right?
4196360	4199200	Like it wasn't like we did more with it.
4199200	4200520	We just produced it.
4200520	4202720	But in the moment it was this odd thing.
4202720	4204920	I was almost kind of like a weird,
4204920	4207000	like more artistic than anything I would do
4207000	4209840	if you let me think about it for any amount of time.
4209840	4212200	I got drunk and started doing this rap in Denver.
4212200	4214640	And I just kept saying, you know, like, we're like,
4214640	4215880	oh, it's about the apology.
4215880	4217480	Like you keep saying he's sorry.
4217480	4220320	I keep, cause I'm rapping about pussies and all this stuff.
4220320	4222320	And I keep, but I'm also like wrapped with like.
4222320	4223160	I wanted to know more about what it means
4223160	4225040	to fuck somebody's mama like it was not slanding.
4225040	4226520	Yeah.
4226520	4227480	That was a show.
4227480	4230920	It was a prime time soap in the eighties.
4234320	4236520	I mean, if you know what Dan Harmon rapping,
4236520	4239760	we know that he likes to spend a lot of time with your mom,
4239760	4240600	always rapping.
4241600	4242440	What else you got?
4242440	4244400	Give us, give us another track.
4244840	4246560	You play your favorites.
4246560	4247400	Okay.
4247400	4248800	That puts you on the spot, but.
4248800	4249920	I was prepared.
4249920	4252000	So that's not a problem for me at all.
4253840	4256800	I am really into this Marc Maron.
4256800	4259200	He's got a diss song to Marc Maron.
4259200	4262160	Oh shit, you got a beef with Marc Maron?
4262160	4263000	I'm really into this.
4263000	4265160	But it's based on the one where Marc Maron was,
4265160	4267400	when we came back from the tour and we were at the Egyptian
4267400	4268840	and Marc Maron was at the show.
4268840	4270240	And as he was coming up to the stage,
4270240	4273040	I did like a Marc Maron rap, kind of.
4273800	4277800	This is sort of like a, yeah, we reproduced that.
4277800	4278960	I don't know about any real beef.
4278960	4279800	I just like the song.
4279800	4280640	So this is from that show, the Egyptian,
4280640	4282760	or it's a redo, like you did later on?
4282760	4284440	This is all studio.
4284440	4286000	We did it in the studio, but we're, yeah,
4286000	4289840	it's like a recreation of the, we're a departure from.
4289840	4292520	It's about to be the podcast beef of 2019.
4292520	4293960	Here we go.
4295960	4298320	Dan Harmon got beef with Marc Maron.
4298320	4300720	Dan Harmon got beef with Marc Maron.
4300800	4303760	Dan Harmon got beef with Marc Maron.
4303760	4304600	Kind of on the note.
4304600	4309600	Beef, Marc Maron, M-A-R-O-N.
4310320	4312720	The fuck your mama's gonna do it again.
4312720	4317600	Marc Maron, when you interview comedy people,
4317600	4318600	it's enlightening.
4319560	4322800	Yo, Marc Maron, why you staring at me?
4322800	4324360	Is your mama rocking, cheering?
4324360	4327400	Gonna fuck her like Sharon Stone.
4327400	4330000	I gave her soup, my bone.
4330000	4332440	And I financed her house with a loan
4332440	4334320	at the bottom of the market.
4334320	4336880	She got robbed, Marc Maron.
4336880	4338640	Does that make your weenie throb?
4339560	4342200	Probably not, unless you're incestuous.
4343160	4345480	Marc Maron, that probably crossed a line,
4345480	4346920	but I don't care.
4346920	4348240	Cause this is beef.
4349360	4351680	But it was still consensual.
4351680	4353280	Call you out.
4353280	4354840	I got beef with you.
4355760	4358240	Marc Maron, why you staring at me?
4358240	4359760	Is your mama rocking, Sharon?
4359760	4360600	Take a knee.
4362760	4363880	Whatever.
4363880	4367920	Marc Maron, Marc Maron, Marc Maron,
4367920	4369360	why you staring at me?
4370360	4372080	Is your mama rocking, Sharon?
4373360	4376760	I'm gonna fuck her like Sharon Stone.
4376760	4377600	As a refrain?
4377600	4381400	Yo, Marc Maron, wine parents.
4381400	4384720	Should this red wine go with this bitch?
4384720	4386400	Should I put your mama's titties
4386400	4389320	on a separate dish from each other?
4389320	4390960	My brother, we got a beef.
4396160	4397160	My brother, we got a-
4397160	4399600	Marc Maron, I want beef.
4399600	4400560	Calling you out.

4423640	4427520	Marc Maron, freeway, Farron.
4427520	4430640	Marc Maron, Marc Maron, forgot your name.
4430640	4433840	Marc Maron, dragon, larin, nerd.
4433840	4434880	Marc Maron.
4437400	4442320	Remember Karen from ancient Greek mythology?
4442320	4443800	Cross the river of sticks.
4443800	4447600	And now I'm crossing your mama with a boat made of dicks.
4447600	4450640	N-A-R-C is the way to spell Marc.
4450640	4451840	Not.
4451840	4454360	Where's the K, bitch?
4454360	4456880	Dan Harmon got beef with Marc Maron.
4456880	4458720	Dan Harmon got beef with Marc-
4458720	4459960	I'm calling you out.
4459960	4462400	Dan Harmon got beef with Marc Maron.
4462400	4464800	Dan Harmon got beef with Marc Maron.
4464800	4466560	Had Obama at his show.
4469080	4472680	So, what number are you on iTunes?
4474040	4475000	Who knows?
4475000	4476360	They use an algorithm, right?
4476360	4479360	Everyone's new podcast is number one for a week.
4479360	4482400	Tries to encourage people to be excited about free labor.
4484560	4487960	He managed to get a dig at capitalism in here.
4487960	4489400	Some dangerous shit.
4492440	4495160	You cross the river of sticks on a boat made of dicks.
4496600	4498000	Inspired.
4498000	4499880	Can fuck it, inspired.
4499880	4501800	All right, well, I mean.
4502800	4505320	I think it's time for some freestyle.
4505320	4507520	You guys are going to make some music together, right?
4507520	4509120	I don't want you to play the thing that we-
4509120	4510960	whatever came of the session where we did it,
4510960	4514080	but I just wanted to mention the session that we did where-
4514080	4515000	because I kept talking about it.
4515000	4518240	I want to do one of these emo things and you're like,
4518240	4522600	look, man, are you just trying to do a Yankovic-y thing?
4522600	4524720	Or do you want to do it?
4524720	4526920	And I was like, well, let's do it.
4526920	4529880	And then you have to get so high.
4529880	4532000	And like, I got really high.
4532000	4534280	You got so high.
4534280	4536240	And I was like in the booth and I remember-
4536240	4537880	all I remember, I swear to God,
4537880	4540800	all I remember is you on the other side of the glass.
4540800	4542880	And I was like, this is joint.
4542880	4545760	And I remember you pressing the button going,
4545760	4547960	Dan, what do you, what do you want?
4547960	4550880	And I was like, I want black people to like me.
4553160	4554000	Why?
4554920	4556360	I don't know.
4556360	4560840	Hopefully with auto tune, this will be good.
4560840	4561680	I don't know.
4562920	4564160	That part didn't make the cut.
4564160	4569120	Just, just know that we, it's not in the final version.
4569120	4572480	I walked out of there and got into an Uber and was like,
4572480	4574720	what, what, who am I?
4574720	4575600	The song is tight.
4575600	4578040	I think this song is dope.
4578040	4578960	Wait, do you have that one?
4578960	4580080	I have all of them.
4581640	4584120	All right, play one more of your favorites, Mike.
4584120	4587520	And then let's cut some new tracks.
4587520	4589760	Then let's replenish the well.
4589760	4590600	Yeah.
4592840	4595840	You probably noticed that since your appearance on the show,
4595840	4599640	I didn't exactly like get better.
4599640	4601880	Like I had a, it was like, it was like,
4601880	4604640	it was like, you know, like a gymnast coach coming out
4604640	4606520	and like, no, you got to do this and that.
4606520	4607360	And it was like-
4607360	4608200	Then I disappeared.
4608200	4609040	So you kept, you went back to your habits.
4609040	4612640	Yeah, and then I just went back to my mama fucking.
4612640	4613480	You did.
4614120	4619120	I'm going to play one of my,
4619120	4621560	you haven't heard this one yet.
4621560	4622880	It's called Smooth Jazz.
4622880	4624520	I really like this song. Smooth Jazz.
4624520	4626440	I fucking love this shit so much.
4628800	4631840	So it's all the, it's all the Harman Town tracks.
4631840	4633000	I don't even know if this was one.
4633000	4636240	I think this may have been just a straight studio original.
4636240	4637440	Oh, is that this?
4637440	4638280	Yes.
4638280	4639120	That's it.
4639120	4639960	Yes, you made a song over that.
4639960	4640800	Right, okay.
4640800	4643160	Oh God, this is, this is the best.
4643160	4645160	Okay, here we go.
4648240	4653240	Oh, shit, shit, oh God, don't come here.
4654920	4656920	This is Smooth Jazz.
4661200	4662400	It's not about fucking.
4663920	4666480	It's about getting to know each other.
4666480	4668040	Get that pussy at rest.
4669760	4672120	Fucking the mom doesn't have to go fast.
4672120	4675200	It can be real smooth like jazz.
4676720	4680240	No, tonight, it's not about that.
4680240	4682320	It's about getting to know you.
4682320	4683680	What's your name?
4683680	4684920	Smooth, what do you mean?
4684920	4687120	I should already know your name.
4687120	4688440	Okay.
4688440	4689280	Your opinion.
4692040	4693200	What's your shoe size?
4695080	4697360	All right, no, I don't have to know that.
4699280	4700880	I'll check back with you later.
4703120	4707000	Damn, girl, you got a lot of hats.
4710440	4712160	Were you in theater in high school?
4712160	4717160	Smooth Jazz, aw, damn, what do you pay for rent here?
4720200	4725200	God damn, are these real hardwood floors?
4726800	4729360	What do I mean real hardwood floors?
4729440	4731200	Just wanna take it easy.
4731200	4733520	Smooth Jazz, nothing creepy.
4734440	4736080	It's a pretty nice place.
4738600	4739640	Where's your roommate?
4741720	4742560	That's cool.
4742560	4743560	Smooth Jazz.
4744760	4746520	Can I grab one of these LaCroix?
4748320	4749440	He's up for grabs.
4751560	4754040	Aw, shit, all you got is coconut.
4755920	4756800	Nobody likes him.
4757800	4760720	Curl up in front of the window.
4762080	4763800	You should really get a fireplace.
4766040	4768520	Nobody curls up in front of a window.
4768520	4769520	Maybe a cat.
4770880	4773280	It's actually colder here, less cozy.
4773280	4776200	Just get a, at least a space heater.
4776200	4777800	God damn, bitch, get a job.
4777800	4780600	Just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm not gonna go with it.
4780600	4782040	Can I make you a Negroni?
4782040	4786600	Negroni, sweet vermouth, gin, Campari.
4787480	4790120	Slice of orange, but I don't have that.
4790120	4791560	It's a good daytime drink.
4792520	4794920	I'm ending up doing cocaine by the end of the day.
4794920	4799920	Smooth Jazz, oh, shit, look at mama again.
4801040	4804880	He means everything to you, oh.
4804880	4807480	Cause you're smooth jazz to me.
4808520	4809360	Where's the bathroom?
4809360	4810200	Thank you.
4811200	4812680	Step, step, step, fully.
4814000	4816320	Door sound, clothes.
4816320	4818720	Damn, let's see what this bitch has in her medicine cabinet.
4818720	4819560	What the fuck?
4819560	4822120	Anti-psychotic pills, no!
4822120	4826200	Smooth, smooth jazz.
4826200	4828200	I don't care, everybody's crazy.
4828200	4829320	I'm crazy for you.
4829320	4830280	What the fuck did I want?
4830280	4833080	The sane person to come home with me in the first night?
4834880	4836960	Your vagina's fine with me.
4837960	4840960	And I don't hold it to a standard
4842960	4845960	that encourages vaginoplasty.
4847960	4851960	Girl, I don't care if your pussy looks like
4852960	4854960	gnarled, scrambled eggs.
4854960	4856960	Looks like chewing gum.
4856960	4857960	So what?
4858960	4860960	Cause I'm not here to say what you should look like,
4860960	4861960	cause look at me.
4861960	4864960	I look like fucking Jim Belushi.
4864960	4865960	I wish.
4866960	4869960	I look like a bag of dead fish.
4869960	4872960	I'm a big fat, hairy, gross piece of shit
4872960	4874960	covered in pimples and zits.
4874960	4876960	There is a difference.
4876960	4878960	And you don't want to know what it is.
4879960	4881960	That's what I look like, naked.
4881960	4884960	So, girl, you don't need to fake it for me.
4885960	4886960	Anyway.
4889960	4890960	Wow.
4890960	4892960	This is me realizing
4893960	4895960	I should have let you hear that before.
4897960	4900960	That was a real toboggan ride into sadness.
4900960	4902960	I mean, when you preceded by going,
4902960	4903960	I love this one.
4903960	4904960	I did.
4904960	4905960	Cause as we know from our work session,
4905960	4907960	I just want black people to like me.
4907960	4909960	You're like, this is my favorite.
4909960	4910960	I'm like, okay.
4910960	4911960	You are one for 10 million.
4911960	4912960	And it sounds good.
4912960	4913960	Sorry, I dehumanized you.
4913960	4914960	It's okay.
4914960	4916960	I still feel human through it all.
4918960	4922960	Do you have the technology to make a new one right now?
4923960	4926960	I got beats so we can rap for sure.
4926960	4927960	Yeah, I think we have to.
4927960	4929960	I mean, clearly,
4930960	4931960	I got the fire.
4934960	4936960	This may be the most fired up I've ever seen you.
4937960	4941960	I'm ready to cross the river stakes on a boat made of dicks.
4942960	4944960	But you, sir, are in luck.
4945960	4946960	Dan's warming up.
4946960	4949960	He's loosening up his whatever he's wearing.
4950960	4951960	Is that a hoodie?
4951960	4952960	What do you got?
4956960	4957960	Does some sexy happen over here?
4957960	4958960	No.
4958960	4959960	Oh, shit.
4964960	4967960	Dan's harnesses Minecraft t-shirt power.
4968960	4969960	Is that what it is, Minecraft?
4969960	4970960	Oh, yeah.
4971960	4973960	Let's see.
4981960	4991960	I think you're a beast, Mike.
4995960	4997960	Okay, I'm not going to fuck any mamas.
4997960	4999960	Yeah, right.
4999960	5001960	Should we have an objective or?
5001960	5002960	Okay.
5003960	5004960	Objectives are good.
5007960	5008960	What do we want to do?
5008960	5009960	We want to solve racism.
5010960	5011960	We said it earlier.
5011960	5012960	Yeah.
5012960	5013960	Well, it's MLK Day.
5013960	5014960	Yeah.
5015960	5017960	That's not why you have me here today, is it?
5017960	5018960	Oh, God.
5018960	5021960	No, you ran into Jeff at the drawing room.
5021960	5022960	That's true.
5022960	5023960	Yeah, that's true.
5024960	5026960	Mike, your band-aid's coming off your face.
5026960	5027960	Shit.
5028960	5030960	Band-aid on your face.
5030960	5031960	Yes.
5031960	5032960	Here with open mic,
5033960	5034960	going to solve race.
5035960	5037960	Race needs to be solved.
5037960	5040960	Racism also needs to be solved.
5041960	5043960	If you solve race, you solve racism.
5044960	5047960	If you just mix everyone's jism,
5047960	5050960	there won't be race, so we can't be racist.
5050960	5053960	But you can't have a band without a bassist.
5053960	5056960	You can't have grapes without raisins?
5057960	5060960	You can't have cranberry without craisins.
5062960	5065960	And then racists like to separate people
5065960	5067960	by the colors of their faces.
5067960	5070960	They'd be mad if one person had a straight tooth
5070960	5072960	and there was another person wearing braces.
5072960	5073960	They'd be like,
5073960	5076960	this is not amazing, because I hate this,
5076960	5079960	because I say things that are hateful.
5079960	5082960	Every hateful person wants to be better.
5082960	5085960	Everybody wishes they were born in a sweater.
5085960	5087960	Then they would never be cold.
5087960	5089960	They wouldn't need pants.
5089960	5092960	Every racist has a hypocritical dance.
5092960	5095960	The hypocritical dance and a stance that they wear,
5095960	5099960	but I'm happy because I also like pants or sweaters.
5099960	5100960	Yes.
5100960	5102960	That's what I was born in.
5102960	5103960	If I didn't wear a sweater,
5103960	5106960	I'd be like transforming into something warm then.
5107960	5111960	Because I would feel left alone like a fucking orphan
5111960	5113960	if I didn't have more skin.
5113960	5117960	But that's like a penis with a foreskin or something.
5117960	5120960	Circumcision comes with a decision,
5120960	5124960	but everything else comes from derision.
5124960	5126960	I don't know what that means,
5126960	5128960	but when you let your mind go,
5128960	5130960	you start to wrap jelly beans.
5130960	5133960	And then little kids start to scream
5133960	5136960	because circumcision is a terrible scene,
5136960	5139960	but that's just a parent's decision,
5139960	5143960	usually informed by some Judeo-Christian religion.
5143960	5146960	Didn't the tortoise put the hair on his plate?
5146960	5150960	And isn't the whole Aesop myth that slow and steady wins the race?
5150960	5152960	You gotta take it slow.
5152960	5155960	You don't have to be the top of the heap, right?
5155960	5159960	You know that you don't have to be like it's me against you.
5159960	5164960	It could be us together, and we could be two, right?
5164960	5165960	Not white.
5165960	5167960	White doesn't make white,
5167960	5169960	and white doesn't make might.
5169960	5172960	Might just be shit, and the English call it shite.
5172960	5178960	If I ruled the world,
5178960	5184960	I'd get me a girl.
5184960	5187960	I love the ladies.
5187960	5189960	Ladies, alright ladies,
5189960	5191960	and I'm rapping for the 80s,
5191960	5192960	just like my kid,
5192960	5194960	cause I don't like conversations.
5194960	5196960	I rap and I'm not a baby,
5196960	5197960	I say it lately,
5197960	5198960	and I like yes or no,
5198960	5201960	I don't fuck with your babies.
5202960	5204960	Koot Joe had rabies,
5204960	5205960	foaming at the mouth,
5205960	5208960	and he didn't have labia.
5208960	5210960	He had a dog penis,
5210960	5213960	a lipstick in a sheath of fur.
5217960	5219960	Sheath of fur.
5219960	5225960	That was like a wolf or a dog pretending to be a bear to a female dog.
5225960	5227960	He was deceiving her.
5227960	5228960	Oh shit.
5228960	5230960	And then it will be a blur.
5230960	5231960	In my memory,
5231960	5233960	I'm cold as December be.
5233960	5236960	Intricately I rap and do my rhymes all the time.
5236960	5237960	Raw is rhyme.
5237960	5239960	It's never overcooked or overlooked.
5239960	5241960	I forgot the fucking symptoms
5241960	5244960	or the direction that we were going in.
5244960	5246960	So I'm flowing like oceans then.
5246960	5247960	This way underground,
5247960	5250960	I bring the thunder down like Zuzi do too.
5250960	5251960	Do the fool,
5251960	5252960	watch your nails,
5252960	5253960	take your cuticles,
5253960	5254960	take the medicine.
5254960	5255960	This shit is chillable,
5255960	5256960	fruitful,
5256960	5257960	mission split
5257960	5259960	just like decisions I'm ripping.
5259960	5260960	It's freestyle shit,
5260960	5262960	it's never written, yeah.
5262960	5264960	It's like in the sky with ribbons,
5264960	5265960	but that's just creepy wonder.
5265960	5266960	But that's that one song,
5266960	5268960	and I can come strong.
5268960	5269960	I've never been stained,
5269960	5271960	dragging punches like I'm Sheng Long.
5271960	5272960	Ain't been in the rain long.
5272960	5274960	I beat my chest like King Kong.
5274960	5276960	Big and then go back and forth with mics
5276960	5278960	like it was ping pong, yeah.
5278960	5279960	It's never saying so.
5279960	5280960	Yeah, I'm sorry.
5281960	5283960	Oh shit.
5283960	5285960	Like Sheng Long.
5288960	5291960	No mamas got fucked in that song.
5291960	5294960	Oh shit, not one mom.
5294960	5297960	Not one mom.
5297960	5299960	Zero mamas.
5299960	5301960	Holy fucking shit.
5301960	5302960	Fucking did it.
5302960	5304960	God damn it.
5304960	5305960	All right, go with the flow.
5305960	5307960	That's fucking incredible.
5307960	5310960	Going back and forth with ping pong,
5310960	5311960	I love that one.
5311960	5312960	We'll make history, God damn it.
5312960	5314960	Yeah, you did it, Mike.
5314960	5315960	No, he did it.
5315960	5316960	He didn't rap about fucking mothers.
5316960	5319960	That's the most, look,
5319960	5321960	I heard him freestyle a lot.
5321960	5324960	A lot of moms got fucked, okay?
5324960	5325960	Yeah.
5325960	5326960	Matter of fact,
5326960	5327960	I think at one point we were like,
5327960	5329960	this whole project has to be about him
5329960	5332960	being somebody's stepfather.
5332960	5335960	Because in that way,
5335960	5336960	talking to you about how he's
5336960	5339960	fucking your mother makes sense.
5341960	5342960	It's very Freudian.
5342960	5344960	I mean, it's literally Freudian.
5344960	5345960	It is.
5346960	5348960	Spencer, you got some freestyle on you tonight?
5348960	5349960	I don't know.
5349960	5350960	I guess.
5350960	5353960	He doesn't sound very close.
5353960	5355960	I would like to hear just a very,
5355960	5357960	you know, just a Spencer freestyle.
5357960	5360960	Doesn't have to be like Fast and Furious again.
5360960	5362960	Yeah, no, we'd all love that, yeah.
5362960	5363960	I agree.
5363960	5364960	I'd love to see that too.
5364960	5366960	That sounds awesome.
5366960	5367960	You know?
5367960	5368960	Yeah.
5368960	5369960	Yeah.
5372960	5373960	Mike's picking a beat.
5373960	5374960	Okay, you ready now?
5374960	5375960	Let's do it.
5375960	5376960	Okay, I'm ready.
5386960	5387960	Eggs in the morning.
5387960	5388960	Eggs in the morning.
5388960	5390960	Scrambled or fried.
5390960	5391960	How you want them, motherfucker?
5391960	5392960	You better decide.
5392960	5394960	Yeah, right now.
5394960	5396960	Eggs in the morning.
5396960	5397960	There's people in line behind you,
5397960	5398960	goddamn it.
5398960	5400960	Fry them in a pan.
5400960	5402960	Put them in a skillet.
5402960	5404960	My stomach's empty, fill it.
5404960	5405960	Yeah.
5405960	5406960	Breakfast.
5406960	5407960	I'm going to kill it.
5407960	5410960	Yeah, breakfast.
5410960	5414960	Oh, eggs in the morning.
5414960	5416960	Coming from a chicken.
5416960	5419960	Yo, how they taste?
5419960	5420960	Mm, delicious.
5420960	5422960	Figure licking.
5422960	5424960	My name is MC Chicken.
5424960	5426960	I got a beak, and I've never licked it,
5426960	5428960	because I don't have a tongue,
5428960	5430960	and even if I did,
5430960	5434960	I don't think I know what I did in an auction,
5434960	5437960	and I'm owned by the farming industry.
5437960	5439960	So my poop is part of my pee,
5439960	5441960	because a chicken butt is also a penis.
5441960	5445960	I don't have a penis because I'm a hen.
5445960	5453960	Sorry to get heteronormative.
5453960	5456960	Non-binary MC Chicken.
5456960	5458960	Yo, I'm neither rooster nor hen,
5458960	5461960	and I'm going to tell it to you like I told you again.
5461960	5464960	I don't crow in the morning, and I don't lay eggs,
5464960	5467960	and I make my own decision, and I walk on my own legs.
5467960	5468960	I am autonomous.
5468960	5470960	I am neither of anything.
5470960	5473960	I do what I do, and I have a song to sing.
5473960	5476960	But I'm a butcher, and I want to sell chicken wings,
5476960	5479960	so that means there's things that we have to do
5479960	5481960	with it before I wasn't mentioning.
5481960	5484960	That means that there are things that are brought about.
5484960	5485960	You're my chicken.
5485960	5487960	I've grown you, but it's time for the slaughterhouse,
5487960	5488960	so here we go.
5488960	5491960	And I'm sorry to be a punk and to take a dump on your dreams,
5491960	5493960	but there's a stump over there,
5493960	5495960	and that's how I have to do.
5495960	5497960	I bled you to this spot here to grab this knife
5497960	5498960	and then behead you,
5498960	5501960	because I have to sell this people shit that they're loving
5501960	5504960	and turn your entire body into like nine nuggets,
5504960	5506960	and that's just all we have.
5506960	5507960	And you had dream stuff,
5507960	5510960	but now your body and flesh is turning into pink stuff
5510960	5512960	that I'm going to deep fry,
5512960	5514960	because I seem wise and it's going to sell you
5514960	5517960	with a big fucking box of these fries.
5517960	5520960	And you like those, too, because that's what I feed you,
5520960	5521960	because farming is gross,
5521960	5526960	but that's how we freestyle and make it sound the most worse.
5528960	5530960	Yo, chicken response.
5535960	5537960	You're not blowing my mind.
5537960	5540960	It's not your time to find the things that make me surprised,
5540960	5546960	like, that's my impression of you.
5547960	5550960	My name is M.C., non-binary chicken.
5550960	5553960	I didn't even meet your opinion.
5553960	5556960	I already know you owe me and you're going to kill me.
5556960	5558960	I'm trying to explain what happens to fulfill me
5558960	5561960	before the sun comes up on the end of my life.
5561960	5564960	You're telling me about particulars that have to do with your knife.
5564960	5567960	I know you have needs and you have labels and you have things,
5567960	5569960	but I'm just telling you what makes me sing.
5569960	5573960	And I'm trying to tell you about these wings, okay?
5573960	5575960	That's the decision I've made, because you're delicious,
5575960	5577960	and that's how it goes.
5577960	5579960	You have to follow me here,
5579960	5581960	because you are the key to my personal economy.
5581960	5584960	I'm sorry it's pretty weird, and I don't want to have to beg,
5584960	5587960	but I need your meat and your body and your eggs.
5587960	5590960	Listen, rise up, and I'll pick you to death.
5590960	5593960	Rise up to stop you till you draw your last breath.
5593960	5596960	I'm M.C., non-binary chicken.
5596960	5598960	You pushed me so far, now it's time I'm kicking.
5598960	5602960	I'm kicking down your door, coming in your house in the middle of the night,
5602960	5605960	and I'm creeping like a mouse, and I'm grabbing all your tools.
5605960	5607960	Oh, and you put all these holes in my blouse.
5607960	5610960	Oh, you have the sharpest mouth.
5610960	5613960	I wasn't prepared for this.
5613960	5622960	I'm not used to this type of treatment from my roosters.
5622960	5624960	White meat, dark meat, chicken thighs.
5624960	5628960	I'm coming in for an Orwellian surprise.
5628960	5632960	If you walk on hind legs, my breakfast just...
5632960	5635960	Hey, excuse me. My name is M.C. Neighbor.
5635960	5637960	Would you guys keep it down? I'm trying to...
5637960	5640960	I work in the morning.
5640960	5642960	That was fun.
5642960	5644960	That was fun.
5645960	5653960	Take that poultry farming industry and...
5653960	5656960	There was a transphobic...
5656960	5657960	Yeah.
5657960	5660960	We like to get work done.
5660960	5663960	Don't have me left in this.
5663960	5669960	Yeah, kind of a vegan trans anthem.
5669960	5671960	A militant vegan trans anthem.
5671960	5673960	You're getting very good at this, Dan.
5673960	5676960	Nobody's mind got fucked in that either, did they?
5676960	5677960	No.
5677960	5679960	Is that fucking two?
5679960	5681960	Still Freudian, though.
5681960	5682960	Yeah, well, okay.
5682960	5683960	Rose up.
5683960	5684960	Baby steps.
5684960	5689960	It's the feeling that you don't have to lock everything down to A, B, A, B,
5689960	5691960	like these metrical things.
5691960	5695960	You can just let a rhyme happen over time throughout the sentence,
5695960	5699960	and that you have the freedom to, and now Dan's got the freedom to.
5699960	5700960	You can find it.
5700960	5702960	I now don't have the freedom to.
5702960	5704960	You can't just announce that I have the freedom to.
5704960	5706960	Dan now has the freedom to.
5706960	5709960	God himself couldn't stop you from being a better freestyle.
5709960	5712960	On this next one, it's called...
5712960	5713960	Shit.
5716960	5717960	All right.
5717960	5718960	I'm not ready.
5718960	5719960	Clear your head.
5719960	5720960	Clear your head.
5720960	5721960	Don't think, throw.
5721960	5722960	Don't.
5722960	5723960	Throw.
5727960	5728960	Why, why?
5729960	5730960	No.
5730960	5731960	Do the hook.
5732960	5734960	I want a lollipop.
5734960	5735960	Yes.
5735960	5736960	Yes.
5736960	5738960	I want...
5738960	5740960	I want a lollipop.
5741960	5743960	I want a lollipop.
5744960	5746960	I want a lollipop.
5746960	5748960	I want a lollipop.
5750960	5753960	I want a lollipop.
5755960	5757960	Dan, what do you want?
5758960	5759960	Yo, girl.
5759960	5760960	Sugar.
5760960	5761960	Sweet.
5761960	5762960	Come get a candy.
5762960	5764960	A little treat.
5764960	5767960	I don't like where this rap is going.
5768960	5770960	I want a lollipop.
5771960	5773960	Then have a lollipop.
5774960	5776960	Just take a lollipop.
5777960	5779960	Have a literal lollipop.
5779960	5781960	I don't want a metaphorical lollipop.
5781960	5783960	Give away free lollipops.
5783960	5791960	The internet has created a situation where we're all satiated with nightmares about predation.
5791960	5794960	We don't want to lend to a starving nation.
5795960	5803960	Every time you think of sweets and kids, you think of predators wearing bibs with little pictures of your little boys.
5803960	5805960	It ruins Christmas.
5805960	5807960	I just came here for a lollipop.
5807960	5809960	I've got a lot of anxiety.
5809960	5812960	I'm the only sugar shop in this whole damn city.
5813960	5815960	Just take a free lollipop.
5815960	5817960	I'm getting so accused of this.
5817960	5819960	Thank you for the lollipop.
5819960	5825960	You can also have some turds.
5825960	5828960	You can also have a licorice.
5828960	5831960	I'm trying to leave with my lollipop.
5831960	5838960	The doors lock from inside with the button that I press on the underside of my Matt Lauer counter.
5838960	5841960	I can't let you leave until you pay your bill.
5841960	5843960	I just need water and a lollipop.
5843960	5845960	Just gotta make sure you pay.
5845960	5847960	I'll take a credit card or cash.
5847960	5849960	It's the usual way.
5849960	5853960	I used an expression when I said...
5853960	5856960	It used to be a free lollipop.
5856960	5862960	I gave them to you, but an exchange of goods and services behoove you.
5862960	5865960	I just called my parents.
5865960	5871960	I jammed your cell signal with my secret candy man computer.
5871960	5873960	It's in the basement made of pewter.
5873960	5878960	I'm a steampunk predatory candy shop owner.
5878960	5884960	I jammed your cell signal with my pewter computer.
5884960	5886960	I want a lollipop.
5886960	5889960	And you're gonna have one.
5889960	5890960	But you're gonna...
5890960	5892960	Not that kind of lollipop.
5899960	5903960	Well, no heroes in that story.
5910960	5913960	I did hear the guy in the beginning. He wanted out.
5913960	5915960	He wanted out of the narrative.
5916960	5918960	But then he got...
5918960	5920960	It was kind of like Macbeth.
5920960	5922960	He spends the first half of the play going,
5922960	5924960	I'm not a murderer.
5924960	5926960	I'm not controlled by witches.
5926960	5928960	And then the forest comes to Duncinea and he's like,
5928960	5930960	I'm on Macduff.
5932960	5934960	I want a lollipop.
5934960	5936960	I'm gonna be singing that the whole night.
5936960	5938960	It's so catchy.
5938960	5941960	I want a lollipop.
5942960	5945960	Oh, music is evil.
5945960	5946960	What's the joke?
5946960	5949960	There's a van driving down the street and there's a little boy
5949960	5952960	and a guy who also windowed down in the van.
5952960	5954960	Oh, Dan knows this one.
5954960	5955960	The welder mask?
5955960	5957960	No, not was one. It's the candy one.
5957960	5958960	Dan wants some candy.
5958960	5959960	He has a candy mask.
5959960	5960960	Yeah, he's got a bag.
5960960	5962960	He says, kid, if you get in the van,
5962960	5963960	I'll give you a piece of candy.
5963960	5965960	And the kid says, if you give me the whole bag,
5965960	5967960	I'll suck your dick.
5968960	5971960	I want a lollipop.
5971960	5974960	Everyone's a winner in that story.
5974960	5977960	Tonight 4chan's a winner.
5977960	5981960	4chan get the uncut person.
5981960	5983960	Jesus.
5985960	5988960	Let's make up for that.
5988960	5991960	What's the opposite of that?
5991960	5993960	That one's a hit.
5997960	6000960	Old people.
6000960	6005960	I want to fuck old people now.
6005960	6008960	They'll love that.
6008960	6011960	Yo, Dan, who you want to fuck, young or old people?
6011960	6014960	Who, Dan, who you want to fuck, young or old people?
6014960	6016960	Yo, Dan, who you going to fuck tonight?
6016960	6017960	Old people.
6017960	6019960	Yeah, tell me how you're going to fuck them.
6019960	6020960	Old people, yo.
6020960	6023960	The wrinkly, the better, the tighter, the sweater,
6023960	6026960	the lower, the prices, the earlier,
6026960	6029960	the bird specials.
6029960	6031960	Yo.
6031960	6032960	Old people.
6032960	6036960	You need bifocals to check out this dick.
6036960	6038960	Up close, it's more slick.
6038960	6043960	Come into your house to watch the stories.
6043960	6044960	Old people.
6044960	6046960	Guiding light.
6046960	6049960	All my children, young and the restless.
6049960	6051960	Dylan.
6051960	6055960	And then we'll curl up under the quilt you made.
6055960	6056960	Old people.
6056960	6057960	Old people.
6057960	6060960	I'm stroking your thighs.
6060960	6063960	Open your eyes.
6063960	6064960	Oh, shit.
6064960	6065960	You're in a coma.
6065960	6066960	Oh, God.
6066960	6067960	You can't see me.
6067960	6068960	You got glaucoma.
6068960	6071960	Yo, tonight, you're going to be on top of me.
6071960	6074960	I hope your shit is covered by AARP.
6074960	6077960	Old people, the best in bed.
6077960	6080960	You can't tell if they're about to be dead
6080960	6082960	because you're fucking old person.
6082960	6085960	You don't know because sometimes they move
6085960	6093960	and sometimes they just go and they have to pee all the time.
6093960	6094960	Yeah.
6094960	6097960	Old people.
6097960	6099960	Old people.
6099960	6100960	I watch CBS.
6100960	6102960	I watch CBS.
6102960	6105960	I watch CBS.
6105960	6107960	Yo.
6107960	6109960	Prime time.
6109960	6112960	Yo, baby, I want to kiss you if you had your shoulders
6112960	6113960	or your shoes.
6113960	6116960	I want to fuck you from behind while you're watching Fox News.
6116960	6119960	I want to get up on that shit.
6119960	6122960	I don't even know where I'm going to find your tit.
6122960	6125960	It might be down below your knees or up behind your back.
6125960	6128960	I want to find you and get inside that crack.
6128960	6133960	But everything is a crack when you got somebody wrinkle.
6133960	6134960	Old people.
6134960	6146960	Tell me about the Depression while I suck on your titties.
6146960	6151960	Tell me about making baseballs out of balls of yarn and cork.
6151960	6152960	Yo, yo.
6152960	6155960	While you're going down to me, I want to ask you,
6155960	6158960	where are you going down in World War II?
6158960	6161960	Were you going down in the French Rebellion?
6161960	6164960	Look, something smelling.
6164960	6167960	Old people smell like baby powder and poo.
6167960	6168960	But that's okay.
6168960	6170960	I'm cool with you.
6170960	6173960	Look, I'm going to fuck you from the floor to the rafter.
6173960	6181960	I'm just going to give you a hand bath after.
6181960	6182960	Old people.
6182960	6183960	Old people.
6183960	6189960	I become you more and more every day, every day, every day.
6189960	6193960	I get closer to you in every organic way.
6193960	6199960	I watch my nuts dragging down to my knees.
6199960	6203960	Please let me fuck an old person.
6203960	6204960	Yo, girl.
6204960	6206960	I like what Dan did.
6206960	6210960	Don't talk to me unless you got grand tears, yeah.
6210960	6215960	I'm busting nuts, busting nuts, but a lot of them blank.
6215960	6220960	It's about to turn to crank on your eyes as you tang, yeah.
6220960	6221960	Let's drop this.
6221960	6224960	Come over here and get a piece of this wrinkly ass.
6224960	6227960	My nuts are so low, they tell me when it's time to mow the grass.
6227960	6230960	My fucking balls are getting swiggy and low.
6230960	6233960	Yo, you can swing them to and fro.
6233960	6236960	I can throw them over my shoulder and make a tie.
6236960	6242960	Look, you like my nutsack tie?
6242960	6248960	Show me more plates that you ordered from the internet.
6248960	6254960	Show me more plates that we can't eat off of yet.
6254960	6264960	Prince says, die, Davey, Crockett.
6264960	6267960	That's good shit.
6267960	6268960	The opposite worked.
6268960	6269960	That was good.
6269960	6270960	It was good.
6270960	6271960	He's just veer right.
6271960	6275960	What was the thing I saw where somebody used the phrase gerontophile?
6275960	6278960	Someone was a gerontophile in something I saw.
6278960	6280960	What does that even mean?
6280960	6283960	Gerontology.
6283960	6287960	People who are viscerally and compulsively attracted to the elderly.
6287960	6293960	Do we worship them as gods in a world where we all agree?
6293960	6298960	Where we're like, well, pedophiles, that's the worst thing you could be.
6298960	6302960	Do we therefore then are these gerontophiles?
6302960	6304960	Should we build statues to them?
6304960	6307960	It's more of a standard deviation kind of thing, I think.
6307960	6313960	If you're on either extreme, it's probably frowned upon.
6313960	6318960	I think it's like, you know how it's like vultures where it's like,
6318960	6320960	but I mean, it's got to happen, right?
6320960	6323960	It's like they're doing a service.
6323960	6326960	I'm not going to do it.
6326960	6331960	It looks horrible.
6331960	6333960	They make a living off of it.
6333960	6334960	Oh, they're paid?
6334960	6335960	Vultures.
6335960	6336960	That's their whole shtick.
6336960	6337960	They love it.
6337960	6338960	They can't get enough.
6338960	6339960	They circle.
6339960	6342960	Their friends come.
6342960	6343960	Where friends come?
6343960	6344960	Yeah.
6344960	6345960	Vultures.
6345960	6346960	Vultures.
6346960	6350960	Also, vultures solve a lot of crimes of missing bodies because the police see,
6350960	6351960	oh, there's some vultures over there.
6351960	6352960	That's probably where the body is.
6352960	6354960	Right.
6355960	6359960	I thought that was in reference to some like 80s vulture detective
6359960	6361960	cartoon that I forgot about.
6361960	6363960	I was trying to remember it.
6363960	6366960	My ass doesn't...
6366960	6367960	Hit a beat.
6367960	6368960	Hit a beat.
6368960	6369960	My kid beat.
6369960	6370960	Right now?
6370960	6371960	Dan, explain what you're about to talk about.
6371960	6372960	I wasn't ready.
6372960	6374960	I don't think it's going to lend itself to a rap.
6374960	6375960	No, no, it's going to.
6375960	6377960	It's just thinking about aging and it was like, you know,
6377960	6380960	what's the one thing that I really wish, you know,
6380960	6383960	I can cope with the bald spot and like, and even death.
6383960	6384960	Like, I can't wait.
6384960	6385960	I can wait.
6385960	6386960	I am.
6386960	6387960	I love waiting.
6387960	6388960	That's what I mean.
6388960	6391960	I'm like, I love playing Minecraft and waiting to die, but I,
6391960	6392960	my...
6392960	6393960	Do you really play a lot of Minecraft?
6393960	6394960	Yeah.
6394960	6395960	Really?
6395960	6396960	Yeah.
6396960	6397960	Wow.
6397960	6398960	So does your kid.
6398960	6399960	That's why you're here.
6399960	6401960	My kid played Minecraft for like one year.
6401960	6402960	He uses mods.
6402960	6403960	He uses mods.
6403960	6404960	Mod packs.
6404960	6405960	You tell him to get those mod packs.
6405960	6406960	We tried to do mods.
6406960	6409960	He've had it on Xbox where you couldn't do the mods.
6409960	6410960	That's, that's chump shit.
6410960	6414960	And then, well, he was seven at the time.
6414960	6415960	So he was a chump.
6415960	6416960	I will.
6416960	6417960	Yeah.
6417960	6420960	But then, uh, we didn't, we couldn't figure out how to make the mods
6420960	6421960	work.
6421960	6422960	Even if you did it like on a phone or whatever, we didn't know how to,
6422960	6423960	like you have to do it on a PC.
6423960	6424960	Is that how you do it?
6424960	6425960	It's hard.
6425960	6426960	Yeah.
6426960	6429960	You got to get it on a PC, a real whip ass Dell Inspiron.
6429960	6430960	Okay.
6430960	6434960	And then you load it up with 180 mod packs and say you can make like
6434960	6438960	computers and systems and that's just, just give me chaos and let me turn
6438960	6443960	it into order and then die like a cyber Christ.
6443960	6445960	Just put everything in order.
6445960	6447960	Slowly like create this system.
6447960	6448960	Or are you just like, do you ever stream?
6448960	6449960	Are you playing Minecraft?
6449960	6450960	No, I can't stream it.
6450960	6452960	The whole point is to hide.
6452960	6455960	I want to just, I was going to go watch you play Minecraft one day.
6455960	6456960	Yeah.
6456960	6458960	Because if you watch it, you'll just be like, what are you doing?
6458960	6459960	I'll just go to your house.
6459960	6462960	Just walk in circles for hours.
6462960	6465960	Just show me for you.
6465960	6467960	You, you, you just show me just for hours.
6467960	6468960	You want to watch me.
6468960	6470960	No, not just for as long as I want to.
6470960	6471960	Oh, okay.
6471960	6473960	Well, I'll bring my laptop.
6473960	6474960	It's great.
6474960	6476960	Do we have a guest next week?
6476960	6477960	Maybe not.
6477960	6479960	We'll, we'll rebook them.
6479960	6482960	What's that?
6482960	6485960	Steve's back there.
6485960	6489960	Well, if you're available next week, I'll, I'll play Minecraft.
6489960	6490960	You can watch until you cry uncle.
6490960	6491960	Okay.
6491960	6492960	I know.
6492960	6493960	I don't want you to do it in front of the people.
6493960	6496960	If you don't want to know, I'll let them like, cause you'll, I'll show you.
6496960	6497960	I'll show you my base.
6497960	6500960	Like, I'll show you my current base.
6500960	6501960	Like I have an elevator.
6501960	6502960	It's kind of cool.
6502960	6503960	I really want to see it.
6503960	6505960	We can put like a, like a, like a slow jam beat on it.
6505960	6508960	And then we, then you and I can just kind of freestyle across it and Spencer.
6508960	6511960	I mean, we can just like, we can, we can, we can, we can narrate.
6511960	6514960	I make, I make bases that are hidden from nobody.
6514960	6515960	Is it?
6515960	6516960	Yeah.
6516960	6519960	Cause no one's, there's literally nobody in the universe but me, but I don't
6519960	6520960	bother to disguise my base.
6520960	6521960	He's made a hideout.
6521960	6522960	Yeah.
6522960	6523960	For no reason.
6523960	6525960	So I fly up to it and then the mountainside turns into a doorway.
6525960	6526960	Holy shit.
6526960	6528960	And then you go into it and it's still, if you didn't know that you have to
6528960	6532960	walk up to this wall and then they're fucking like, I spent days making a
6532960	6533960	piston powered like thing.
6533960	6537960	It goes, and it pops out and there's a button and you press it and the
6537960	6539960	elevator goes down.
6539960	6540960	I want to see this real bad.
6540960	6541960	Yeah.
6541960	6542960	Yeah.
6542960	6543960	It's so satisfying.
6543960	6545960	If I could have that in real life, like nobody would ever have any trouble
6545960	6546960	from me.
6546960	6548960	All you got to do is be Batman.
6548960	6551960	If I could just go down to the center of the earth and there would be like
6551960	6556960	three giant things with lasers going into nothingness and spewing out
6556960	6564960	into a, like an electrical matrix, like tons of ore that I, that wasn't
6564960	6567960	coming from anywhere that was being hurt, but I, it was my job to categorize
6567960	6573960	it and funnel it into systems that allowed my base to slowly expand.
6573960	6577960	I just, before I came here today, I made a room that makes concrete and I'm
6578960	6581960	like, that's, that's the day that you make a room that makes concrete.
6581960	6583960	I have a concrete factory.
6583960	6585960	This is amazing.
6585960	6588960	So it's sand and gravel come out of this thing and then I took the sand and
6588960	6592960	gravel and I funnel it into this thing and as I make concrete powder and then
6592960	6595960	it goes into this like fluid transposer and it makes the concrete.
6595960	6597960	So then I'm like, now I have concrete.
6597960	6600960	I don't even like Minecraft, but I've ever been so turned on in my life.
6600960	6602960	Yeah.
6602960	6609960	But I looked, I saw a thing that was like, what is that, that guy, there's
6609960	6614960	like a guru guy who's like a, he's like a to do guru or something and he has
6614960	6617960	a system that's like a get things done or something like that.
6617960	6618960	Is that it?
6618960	6619960	There's like a.
6619960	6620960	Learn the cable guy.
6620960	6621960	Yeah.
6621960	6622960	Get.
6622960	6623960	It's done.
6623960	6625960	Get, get her done.
6625960	6626960	I don't know.
6626960	6629960	I said thing, but I saw, I saw his thing and I was like, oh shit, that's me
6629960	6630960	playing Minecraft.
6630960	6634960	It was like this thing where he's like, he sells this kind of principle where
6634960	6639960	he's like, uh, you, you take chaos and you, you, you go through this process
6639960	6641960	where you, you just take everything.
6641960	6644960	It's all about actually licensing yourself to live life.
6644960	6649960	Uh, unless you're like me where you, but, but, but like, like, where if you felt
6649960	6652960	like you could walk around and anything that happened to you was therefore
6652960	6653960	valuable.
6653960	6657960	Like, I think that's what hoarders are thinking where they're like, they're
6657960	6662960	actually like, I can, I, when I watch hoarders, I'm like, I'm so close to like,
6662960	6665960	I could see that because it's like, you just like imagine where you were so
6665960	6669960	free that every piece of garbage you saw was valuable.
6669960	6671960	And then you'd be like, let me grab that.
6671960	6674960	And then like, I'll save it for later, but there's like a kink in the system
6674960	6679960	where they're not able to, uh, just put it into a thing where there could be
6679960	6683960	boxes within boxes and you could just like go like, Oh, this is my whole life.
6683960	6686960	Every, every moment that I'm experiencing, I'm in charge of it.
6686960	6689960	So then anyone that comes up to you and goes like, can I have a dollar?
6689960	6690960	You're like, I don't know.
6690960	6695960	Can you, uh, instead of like, you know, like, like avoiding life where you're
6695960	6698960	just like, Oh, I'm going to go back to my laptop.
6699960	6700960	Sorry.
6700960	6702960	I hit it by accident.
6702960	6704960	I don't, I don't, what do you think about that?
6704960	6705960	Don't you think that's deliberate?
6705960	6710960	I mean, I'm here every week, but I feel like it's deliberate.
6710960	6713960	I put my hand down on my iPad and it made it, it made a thing happen.
6713960	6717960	So I think he gets jealous and then he like throws these weird, I, they're
6717960	6722960	probably unconscious, but it's like he, can I, can I, is there, is there a room?
6722960	6724960	Is there a space between deliberate, but not jealous?
6725960	6728960	I know. I just actually just put my hand down on the thing.
6728960	6729960	All right. These kids have school in the morning.
