0	9000	Welcome to Meltdown Promise in Hollywood, California. Harbontown is now in session.
9000	18000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harbontown, Mr. Dan Harbough.
18000	33000	Thank you. Thank you so much. Happy New Year, 2015. We're in Back to the Future's version of the future.
33000	37000	Are we all wearing metal hats and things like that?
37000	46000	We've got little LEDs. You have to choose whether you're a Lobo, a Squeeb Squab, or a Zip Head.
46000	50000	There's three. You're a Trank, a Lobo.
50000	52000	Wait, do you actually know?
52000	54000	Yeah, low-res Bojo.
54000	61000	Low-res Bojo and Flapjack? What are the three? That's Back to the Future 2, anyway.
61000	69000	YouTube recommend. I recommend YouTube. It's amazing.
69000	73000	Videos just direct to your computer.
73000	80000	The next time you're like, oh boy, I've got nothing to do. I've got nothing to think about.
80000	86000	My world isn't dark enough.
86000	92000	This will actually lighten it up. There's these videos. Shrob sent me.
92000	100000	There's this guy. This is my new fascination is the people who are exposing things, like the Illuminati things.
100000	106000	Like the patterns that they see in stuff. You've seen the one that's like Angels in the Outfield.
106000	113000	There's a guy who's proving that Angels in the Outfield is like a pedophile spell that it's casting on you.
113000	119000	And it just keeps freezing. He's right here going, look where his eyes are looking, right at the little boy's dick.
119000	125000	It's like the Back to the Future one is fucking amazing.
125000	129000	There's this guy who throws everything at it.
129000	143000	First of all, he sees every moon landing, JFK, and 9-11 in Back to the Future.
143000	154000	He literally says at one point in his video, the movie is crawling with 9-11s as he's pointing them out.
154000	164000	There is a point, for example, when the DeLorean finally goes Back to the Future and leaves the trail of 11
164000	172000	as it heads for the movie theater and the camera pans back, and there is a fucking goddamn if there isn't a goddamn 9.
172000	180000	It's like some kind of western themed breakfast place or something with a lasso for a logo and it's like 9-11.
180000	190000	I'm a convert, but the crazy thing about it is that the guy can detect every 9-11 and he sees JFK's head everywhere,
190000	197000	but he doesn't know that there's a difference between Back to the Future one and two.
197000	201000	He keeps referring to him as the same movie. It's like, no, that's the second one.
201000	205000	You're in the splash zone here, my friend. You're going to get a little bit of...
205000	214000	What happens is my mustache has a wick effect and I take a drink, the vodka capillaries up,
214000	218000	and so then whenever I have an explosive...
218000	225000	The other day, I picked a pack of peppers. I don't know.
225000	231000	It's just vodka. It's not even spit. It's just pure vodka. It's good for you.
231000	234000	If you sit in the right place, you can get fucked up.
234000	239000	Yeah, especially him. Look at him. He's a pretty fresh-praised young man.
239000	244000	I believe you could get drunk off of a little bit of aerosol vodka.
244000	251000	That's a compliment. You're a very handsome little boy.
251000	257000	If you want to watch Angels in the Outfield later...
257000	263000	Dan, is it me or is your beard achieving greatness?
263000	269000	I noticed backstage I can actually grab it with my fist now. There's a thing here I can grab.
269000	271000	A threshold has been crossed with your beard.
271000	276000	I lost my trimmer at the wedding. It's somewhere in the house.
276000	281000	I had my beard trimmer. I trimmed my beard for the wedding and I haven't trimmed it since.
282000	287000	It looks trimmed, though. You've manicured a nice, gentle-ben kind of beard.
287000	290000	I haven't.
290000	294000	YouTube. We're talking about YouTube.
294000	297000	Well, no.
297000	302000	Just check that out. Just Google or use Yahoo.
303000	310000	Back to the future, 9-11.
310000	319000	The JFK stuff is really interesting because the guy is convinced that the Hill Valley is identical to Deli Plaza.
319000	328000	And that Marty McFly is standing where Kennedy was shot when he's looking at the sports almanac.
328000	335000	And then in the window where you see the sports almanac, you see two different presidents portrayed two-dimensionally.
335000	345000	But then you can see a Kennedy head that is three-dimensional, thus proving the point which is that Kennedy is a transcendent, multi-dimensional being.
345000	351000	And his assassination has something to do with Back to the Future and 9-11.
351000	354000	Spielberg has did it again.
354000	362000	And the guy keeps calling. Of course he's gaga for the Twin Pines thing. Of course he's crazy about the Twin Pines thing.
362000	368000	He's like, for some reason, now there's one pine. Motherfucker, watch the movie that you're...
368000	373000	It's not a hidden message. It's the joke is that the...
373000	377000	It's like, why is there now one pine?
377000	380000	It's a bit.
380000	384000	That's Pine 11.
384000	387000	That's been our show. Thanks, guys. Thanks for coming.
394000	398000	The thing is, that wasn't even funny.
398000	401000	You guys are a real pushover.
401000	405000	Yeah, they're a hot crowd. We gotta reward them.
405000	412000	Gotta reward them for this heat. Gotta make some popcorn with this.
412000	421000	So, this is the last week, I think, that the music is gonna be just a free-for-all, copyright-wise.
421000	424000	Should I just play Beatles all night, then?
424000	427000	Yeah, yeah. But we're asking...
427000	433000	If you go to harmontownmusic.tumblr.com, if you're a musician anywhere in the world, really,
433000	439000	there's already people that are giving us stuff that we can use under a term that they can agree to.
439000	444000	We'll use people's stuff who let us use their music, and we'll be able to give you credit.
444000	448000	That'll be fun, because I love being able to play whatever I want, but I would love to...
448000	452000	If it was all Armenian music, that'd be pretty cool.
452000	455000	Yeah, yeah. Well, it'd be cool, because, yeah, they do a little thing.
455000	461000	Especially, like, stir me up a little hip-hop pudding.
464000	467000	You little hip-hoppers out there, within the sound of my voice.
467000	482000	You know, you could be really... I'm sure that would be a real honor for your beats to be served up alongside my dropped science.
482000	489000	Okay, so SimCity Build It is going on in the news.
489000	493000	I'm playing it on my iPad, and you know how those Sims...
493000	496000	You know how the Sims, like, they talk gibberish, like Sim language.
496000	499000	They go, like, argh, argh, argh, argh.
499000	508000	There's a guy, every time you click on a guy that's gonna sell you something or buy something from you,
508000	513000	he goes, he goes, pussy whips.
513000	514000	Pussy whips?
514000	515000	Yeah.
515000	516000	Pussy whips.
517000	518000	Yeah, or lips.
521000	522000	Pussy whips.
522000	523000	Yeah, check it out for yourself.
524000	527000	It's free to play, so check it out.
528000	535000	But, of course, after a while, you might have to buy magic dollars to keep potatoes from taking a year to grow.
536000	540000	This goddamn virus, this style of game.
540000	541000	Terrible.
542000	548000	I was driving here, and I had my iPad plugged into my car, like, iPod thingy,
548000	551000	and I forgot someone named Kyle Coberly.
551000	553000	Does anyone know him? Kyle Coberly?
553000	554000	He sent us this.
571000	582000	Welcome, Dan Harmon and Jeff Bryan Davis.
583000	584000	That's nice.
586000	589000	See, send us cool shit while playing.
592000	598000	That seems like a little bit of some back to our shenanigans, like, that guy's a little more into you than me.
602000	604000	Johnny Carson's on the show.
604000	607000	Now please welcome Ed McMahon.
607000	609000	Edward Anastasia.
610000	616000	McMahon.
617000	619000	Because Davis doesn't even rhyme with anything.
620000	621000	It's a hard name to rhyme.
622000	623000	Selfie sticks.
626000	627000	Are happening in the news.
628000	630000	You got back from Paris.
630000	634000	I was at the Eiffel Tower a couple weeks before you, and everybody had their goddamn selfies.
634000	636000	Selfies be stickin'.
637000	639000	People be selfie stickin'.
642000	643000	You got me, man.
644000	646000	I don't know, man. They were all over Venice.
646000	649000	Did you get the thing when you were in Paris where the people walked up? Do you speak English?
650000	652000	There are women that walk up to you. Do you speak English?
652000	654000	I don't talk to women.
655000	657000	That's a hard line.
658000	663000	No, it's just people are like panhandlers, but the thing is, you look American, do you speak English?
665000	683000	A previous trip to Paris, I think, I encountered, like, somebody came up and thrust a note into my hands that was like this long, tragic tale of, like, my child is basically like a global, kind of born-identity voice.
684000	693000	It was like a version of, I ran out of gas, my kids are in the car, but it was like much more, like, creepy, like, you know, why do I know where the exits are?
694000	699000	Where's my safety deposit box? I can't even remember how we responded to it. You said, yes, like, that's happened to you.
700000	703000	Do you remember what it is? Like, what's the in and out of it?
704000	712000	No, they didn't speak English very well themselves, because they had this kind of broken English written down, and it was, yeah, a soft story in our school.
713000	718000	Yeah, and you just kind of have to give the note back. You're like, here's your, here's your note back.
719000	720000	So selfie sticks.
721000	723000	Selfie sticks are happening.
724000	725000	Do you have one?
725000	726000	I don't have a selfie stick.
726000	730000	What's the point of a selfie stick? If you don't have a friend to hold your camera?
731000	740000	I don't know. Well, I saw, first I saw people, the first selfie stick I saw was in Venice, and I thought, oh, this must just be something, like, maybe it's canal-based.
741000	747000	Maybe people want to take, maybe there's too many canals here, and maybe it's an adaptation, like a gondola, you know?
748000	753000	Like, you can't take a good selfie. Too many people lose their phones over the canal, maybe.
754000	759000	But then it turned out, oh, no, I've just arrived in Europe as the selfie stick has arrived out of humanity.
760000	763000	Are these people walking around by themselves with the selfie stick, or are they with other people?
763000	792000	I saw a couple, I was walking in Paris behind a couple, not even in, like, a touristy place, and I was behind a couple in an empty street, and they were walking and holding hands, and the man let go of her hand, took the selfie stick, extended it, and got, like, a tracking, like, selfie stick shot of them walking just for a little bit, and then put it, they both, they kept their heads forward.
793000	796000	While he did it, he got the shot, and then re-telescopes it.
796000	800000	So they're just, like, the, like, survivor man walking down the road, like, just, like, filming themselves?
800000	804000	I don't know, yeah, it's just, I guess it's just, they feel it's a better shot. I guess it's, like, a little jib for them.
805000	808000	I don't like it. I'm a gimmick.
809000	811000	I, I, I, was it worth it, Adam?
815000	817000	Adam, if you had a selfie stick, would that have been easier for you?
818000	825000	I would, yeah, if everybody, next week, everybody bring selfie sticks, and we'll do something with them, I don't know.
826000	827000	It worked for Ellen.
828000	829000	All right.
830000	833000	Would, would, would you get a selfie stick, if you had one, would you use it?
833000	841000	If, if I was able, would you, would you get a selfie, no, I wouldn't, I don't, I, I was, I was, I was definitely, I had a lot of opportunities to get a selfie stick.
841000	846000	If somebody, if somebody gifted you one at work, would you, would you, would you ironically carry it around and then use it?
846000	849000	No, I would use, I would use it to see what the hubbub's about.
850000	852000	It just seems like a stick with your camera on the end of it.
852000	852000	
852000	853000	It's stupid.
853000	854000	Well.
854000	857000	Ask a stranger, ask a stranger as they take a fucking picture of me.
857000	861000	Yeah, well, I mean, maybe that's, I don't know, you, you don't have.
862000	865000	Yeah, well, I, whatever he said is true, too.
866000	867000	You, you both have your points.
867000	870000	Your beard has got me mesmerized. Your beard is really good.
870000	873000	Also, the gray is coming in nicely.
874000	876000	You now have a properly gray beard.
876000	877000	It doesn't matter.
881000	899000	He's, Liam Neeson is, he's, Liam Neeson is in taken three and he's, he, he, there's a, somebody, somebody sent me a link to a LinkedIn, like promotion, where he's, he's,
900000	908000	it's him doing his character saying like, oh, my name's, uh, Connor McJohnson, whatever his character's name is.
908000	916000	Me and my friends have a particular set of skills, um, skills like enhanced conversation.
916000	926000	Uh, and then they'll cut to like a clip from taken where they're like meeting people up, uh, aerodynamic, uh, persuasion, and then throwing a guy out a window.
927000	932000	And then, and then he goes on to say, say like, do you have a particular set of skills?
932000	942000	If you send in your LinkedIn profile, um, a lucky winner will have me read their resume to their prospective employers explaining their particular set of skills.
942000	944000	He keeps saying particular set of skills.
944000	945000	For real?
945000	947000	Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing.
947000	950000	Why don't we try that? Why don't we get, get on that?
950000	952000	Go ahead. Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.
952000	956000	Do it. Get, get, get on LinkedIn and make a profile.
956000	958000	What is, what is LinkedIn?
958000	961000	It's something that everyone outside LA uses.
965000	967000	I don't understand it at all.
968000	970000	It's job Facebook.
971000	980000	It's a resume. It's like a, it's like the internet equivalent of while someone's driving by you on a, on a, on a road,
980000	987000	throwing your resume through their back window so that they have it.
991000	997000	Except unless you're hiring a backseat person, you're going to find it and be annoyed.
997000	1001000	You're going to be like, who put this garbage in my car or my inbox?
1001000	1009000	The cool thing about it is that, like, I'll see every once in a while, I'll get a LinkedIn profile, like a LinkedIn request from somebody like,
1009000	1015000	from like 12 years ago that was like a, like a bigger shot than me.
1015000	1018000	And like now is like sending me their LinkedIn profile. That's kind of cool.
1019000	1027000	It's like seeing them like, like, like, you know, you know, selling selfie sticks on a boardwalk or something.
1027000	1034000	LinkedIn. I'm sure it's, I'm sure LinkedIn is great for people that I just, I don't understand.
1035000	1045000	You know, so it helps you. Maybe if you stain glass, but you don't like to cut glass and you send your LinkedIn profile out and there's some guy that's like, he only likes cutting glass, but he doesn't know how to stain it.
1049000	1050000	I think that's the idea.
1051000	1053000	Did you enjoy your honeymoon? Was it fun?
1053000	1056000	Yeah, because you guys run everywhere. You guys were in Dublin and Paris and Venice.
1056000	1060000	Yeah. I figured out why I love Dublin and Ireland.
1061000	1076000	Because we went to like this Irish storytelling night, like a very touristy thing, like in this, in this bar, which is like, you get a dinner and this lady stood in front of a fireplace and told Irish stories and sang songs and stuff.
1076000	1089000	And it was really cool. And she explained Irish history and I, it kind of dawned on me, like, listening to this stuff, why I fetishize Irish culture is because they're, they're a European culture without, they didn't have a renaissance.
1089000	1097000	They don't, they don't have, they didn't participate in this rich people bullshit. Like they're, they're, they're, they're their own little, little thing.
1097000	1111000	Like they don't, if you go back in their history, any other like European culture, it's like, if you go to their museums or whatever, there's going to be some like red suspenders at some point, like, or some like fancy pointy shoes or like a windmill hat or something.
1111000	1118000	Like, like, oh, and then we did this. So this is what we're famous for. He could do what to do. Like, like, like, look at us.
1118000	1127000	Like we look like flower people are like, like, like, like we got, we got perfume on our, on our, on our, on our, on our face.
1127000	1129000	What country is that?
1129000	1137000	The one I just described, like all of them, except for Dublin, you know, like I, I, the country of Dublin.
1137000	1147000	I thought, I, I thought you said city. The, uh, the, the, they're just, they're just poor potato people. They just grew with the potato.
1147000	1157000	They're just, they're just, they're just dirty little people and they, and they had to, they, they, they, they, they,
1157000	1161000	I wish, I wish that was inflammatory enough for you to get letters about that.
1161000	1165000	No, they don't care because they've been dirty potato people.
1165000	1171000	They're fine with that. They don't care. They, they, they have a great sense of humor. They don't, they're not effective.
1171000	1176000	I think, I think everybody cares about you when you call them dirty little people.
1176000	1178000	You're wrong.
1178000	1183000	We, we had our Irish friend, Gramlin, I had here last, last, last a couple of weeks ago.
1183000	1186000	That dirty little guy.
1186000	1188000	Shut up, Adam.
1188000	1194000	You told him I, I called Irish people dirty little potato people. Not on Twitter though, out of context. Don't.
1194000	1198000	But, uh, like he'd be like, yeah, that about sums it up.
1198000	1203000	You said it, you said it in context though. You, you called Irish people dirty little potato people.
1203000	1207000	Yes. And so they're, they're,
1207000	1214000	all of their songs and poetry and literature and things like they're, they're not, they don't come out of any kind of nobility or anything.
1214000	1224000	It's kind of like, uh, it's very nice. They didn't really, didn't really dawn on me until I was, until I was really learning about it, uh, over, uh, over, uh, mashed potatoes.
1224000	1228000	They still love potatoes over there too.
1228000	1232000	Their, their, their civilization exploded because of the potato.
1232000	1239000	The potato became a thing like that they could do and they, they, they grew, they grew in population quite a bit.
1239000	1252000	Uh, and then of course there was the potato blight and then like things got real bad for them and, uh, uh, you know, the rest is, uh, history.
1252000	1257000	Can you sing a little Irish song for us about it?
1257000	1270000	That's what, that's what she would do. She would go like, oh, and there's a, there's a, uh, one of the fairies of, of, of the, of the potato patch was the Shin Lanean.
1270000	1279000	The Shin Lanean was a lovely woman, but take the form of a very seductive lady and she would come a call in when the things and blah, blah, blah.
1280000	1283000	And then, and then, and there's a song about her.
1287000	1289000	Well, that doesn't sound right.
1291000	1298000	She sounded beautiful. I bought her CD. That's how beautiful she sounded. I don't even have a CD player.
1300000	1306000	I just bought it because I'm like, make more music. I don't know. Keep making it.
1306000	1310000	Does it, there's a fairy of the potato patch? No, I made that all up.
1311000	1319000	There's no, there's a, that was one of the coolest things about Irish folklore was the, the, uh, fairy, uh, I don't know, it's the idea of fairies.
1319000	1325000	Like, uh, the, we, we all, uh, you know, have our understanding of fairies, like take the Tinker Bells and the whatnot.
1325000	1334000	They, they're always, for us, they're always small and they always have insect wings and they have like, you know, like, you know, there's a very specific fairy, like kind of image we get in our head.
1334000	1348000	But, but, but the word fairy originally just meant, it's like, it's just kind of these crazy, like magical beings that are kind of one foot in, one foot out, like, um, as a, you know, as pre-Christian mythology that got, uh, Christianized.
1348000	1362000	But like the, the way that they Christianized it was to say that, uh, when Lucifer went down from heaven into hell, there were, there were a bunch of angels, uh, you know, who were like totally like hail Lucifer.
1362000	1368000	I'm going to go with him right away. And then there were like the angels that were like, fuck Lucifer. I'm going to stay, stay up here.
1368000	1375000	But then there were like the kind of like, I don't know, let's see where the action is. Um, kind of wandering downward.
1375000	1382000	And then there was like an angel that went to God and said, uh, come on, give those guys a break. Don't, don't make them go all the way to hell.
1382000	1389000	And, uh, and then God like snapped his fingers in at the exact moment, you know, when he, when he called, you know, it's like play it where it lays.
1389000	1400000	So some, some, some angels were like, you know, in the ocean and somewhere in a rock and somewhere like, uh, had half of their head in a flower in their foot in a, you know, a pork chop or something.
1400000	1412000	So, so like, that's the kind of fairy you are, you know, like you're the, you're, you're a, if you're, if you, if you get a pork chop for a foot and then, uh, like a, like a flower for a hand.
1412000	1422000	And then, but it's just like, you know, their fairies are like, they could be monsters. They're like Cenobites. They're, uh, they're angels to some and demons to the two others.
1422000	1426000	And a leprechaun is one of those. A leprechaun is a fairy. Jeff, did you know that?
1426000	1428000	I did not.
1428000	1431000	What do they call the one that has half a foot in a pork chop?
1431000	1436000	That's a, I don't, that's a sin fire.
1436000	1438000	Did you enjoy a Venice, Italy? How was that for you?
1438000	1441000	Did you know, did you know a banshee is also a fairy?
1441000	1448000	They're all fairies. Every, every monster you could name, werewolves or fairies. I made that up.
1448000	1450000	How was, how was Venice for you? Do you enjoy that?
1450000	1459000	Venice was cool. Uh, uh, uh, I, I, I got to walk around Venice like, uh, by myself on Christmas Eve.
1459000	1465000	Uh, it's crazy. Cause I didn't even realize until the daylight, like how crowded that city can get.
1465000	1473000	And the winter, it's pretty dead, which is why Peter Weller recommended it in his architecture blog, which Aaron read.
1473000	1480000	The reason we went to Venice is because Aaron read this article by Peter Weller, who is not only robo, robocop apparently,
1480000	1483000	but is also a PhD in like Renaissance architecture.
1483000	1492000	It's a huge history, history nut. Yeah. Um, and it's arguably like more into like Renaissance architecture than being into robocop.
1492000	1500000	But, but like we, we, we were joking about, cause in the article he talks about why you should go to Venice in the winter,
1500000	1510000	why it's so beautiful. And, uh, um, uh, you know, so, so Aaron booked all this travel based on this like article that he wrote.
1510000	1515000	And we did, we went, we're going to a lot of the places that he recommended and we kept joking like,
1515000	1520000	I will probably run into Peter Weller. But so we finished dinner on Christmas, Christmas day.
1520000	1527000	Was it Christmas? Was it Christmas night? And, uh, yeah, I finished dinner and, uh, went down to get our coats
1527000	1533000	and we're putting on our coats and like this kind of coat room. And then in walks Peter Weller. No. Yeah.
1533000	1543000	And like, uh, just froze and Aaron looked at me, like, gave me this look that was like silently communicating like, like, should I?
1543000	1548000	And I'm like, yeah, fucking go for it. Like, cause I don't, I'm not going to talk to him like about, like,
1548000	1555000	I'm not going to go like dead or alive. You're coming to Venice. Like, all I'm going to talk about is robocop.
1555000	1562000	Talk to him about fucking this bullshit you read him about. And she's like, excuse me. I'm sorry.
1562000	1571000	We, we, uh, we read, we read your article about, about Venice in the winter. And he's like, no, you're here.
1571000	1580000	He kind of, he kind of held his hands out. Like, and the amazing thing is you have to, you have to understand like Peter Weller,
1580000	1589000	like while the beautiful Christmas miracle, this is like fucking Peter Weller. But while he's, while he's talking to us,
1589000	1598000	people are, he's speaking in Italian to these, you know, people who are putting his winter clothes back on him.
1598000	1609000	And so as he's speaking to Aaron about Venice, he's becoming this old Italian man because like the cape and the scarf and the hat are going on.
1609000	1617000	So it's like, like, like, kind of like robocop kind of came in and it was like, and then he talked to, and then he slowly became like, you know,
1617000	1624000	I don't know, he just started, like, he became like one of those cool old guys that walks through like an Italian city, like, like, like at night,
1624000	1633000	like looking at a pocket watch and eating a, eating a panini. But, but, so, so he just, he just talked to Aaron for like, you know,
1633000	1644000	15 minutes or so about like, like how cool Venice is and why he wrote that article. And, and I just, I just sat there and stared like, yeah, that's it.
1644000	1650000	That's all that's, you know, if Aaron's got a different version of that story, but I love that. It was pretty, it was pretty amazing.
1650000	1657000	It was just like a really magical thing. Like when you, when you, when something like that happens, you kind of like, you kind of, you kind of gather,
1657000	1664000	gather it up in a little jar and you kind of like just want to run out like right away, but you make it last as long as you can.
1664000	1671000	You try not to, you know, overkill, like, you just kind of like ran around the corner and we're like skipping, going like,
1671000	1680000	he's right behind us. He's right behind us. But like, gotta, gotta get somewhere safe so we can like just crack up and like roll around on the cobble.
1680000	1690000	Like, like, like, like freaking out, like, like, like repeating every, every, every word. That's so good. He had a purple cashmere scarf.
1690000	1700000	It had to be a gift. Like, like, it looked, it looked so odd. I think someone gave him a purple cashmere scarf for,
1701000	1704000	he gave him about it for a dollar. Adam, let's do it.
1708000	1709000	I'm sad that I got that joke.
1712000	1715000	Did you ever see the new RoboCop? No. Yeah, I saw it.
1717000	1724000	Did they, did they stick with a new outfit or did they redid the outfit? Yeah, they redo it. Yeah. Yeah. And they make a point of redoing it.
1724000	1734000	Like, like, they have a scene where it goes like, you should make it black. I don't even understand what they were doing. I don't get it. I don't like it. I don't like, I don't like it.
1735000	1744000	I did some terrible, terrible movie that never, never was released with Kurtwood Smith and he was in it. We'd never worked together. And he sat in front of me at the screening and it was so bad.
1745000	1759000	And I just, I was freaking out because RoboCop Kurtwood Smith was in front of me. And at the end he grabs me. I was dead on page 40. And at the end of the movie, he grabs me by my collar, by my tie and pulls me towards me and goes, boy, did they kill you too early.
1762000	1763000	I was like, I got out when the getting was good.
1764000	1766000	Cabin times? What was that called?
1767000	1768000	Cabin times.
1775000	1787000	It wasn't cabin fever because that's a thing, right? It was called, uh, it's something cabin. No, it's not a deadly cabin. I wish it was called deadly cabin. It's called evil remains.
1788000	1791000	Oh, evil remains colon. It's cabin time.
1796000	1801000	It took place in a cabin. There was, there was a cabin for certain. I've never seen that one. Don't.
1803000	1815000	It's a horror movie. And I went to the screening of it and Kurtwood Smith is in front of me and the other actors in the film. And they brought a bunch of people into the, uh, the Lemley theater like in the Sunset Boulevard thing.
1816000	1826000	Whatever the fuck it is. And, uh, it's so bad. I think the audience thought it was a comedy incident. Then they just started laughing to the whole thing. But it's not a comedy either.
1827000	1837000	But nobody thought it was scary either. So it became a comedy and we were just like sinking down into our seats. And it was really bad. Really, really, really bad.
1838000	1846000	Well, all right, let's see what else we got here. I ran into a kid in Paris that, uh, learned English from watching community and Sopranos.
1847000	1850000	Um, can you do an impression of what that would be like?
1851000	1858000	Well, no, I mean, there's no, you know, what do you like? He would say, but Bada, bada, boom, a pop, pop, or, you know,
1858000	1872000	Met about it. Met about it. And there was another kid there and he had this, well, whatever. No one's interested in that.
1873000	1882000	No, I've told it like three times and no one cares. There was this other, this other French kid that showed up and he had an app on his phone that he showed me.
1882000	1890000	I just thought this was kind of interesting because it's like, I don't know, it's a foreign people who we don't know anything about them. What are they doing?
1891000	1904000	Like, how could your show that you write had never having been outside of the country? You know, how could it ever be appealing to like, you know, like people who don't speak the same language when they're, when they're, when they're, when they're in grade school.
1905000	1906000	Did they watch it in French or in English?
1906000	1919000	Well, they, they, I think they watch it in English. Like I said, one of them, one of them, one of them would watch it with French subtitles on first and then to change them to English subtitles and then eventually turn the subtitles off.
1920000	1933000	That's something they do there. They're so steeped in English, like, you know, more so than we are steeped in French, that it's a little, it makes it a little more natural for them to be able to do that. But rest assured, we are a lazy bunch.
1934000	1960000	I really am. I can't, I can't, I can't just, I can't do it. Like, I can't, like, like, Aaron, Aaron knows definitely more, more French than me. But like, also, I think there's this crucial thing where it's like, shit, like, there's just, there's just a shamelessness of like, like, you have to, you can't, you can't like, you have to like, just be willing to speak wrong in order to ever successfully speak to someone who speaks a different language.
1960000	1982000	You can't be like this, held up by this, like, like, like, this is fear that like, seizes me, you know, you just end up going like, oh, bonjour, le bacon, le bacon, le bacon, I'd like, le bacon, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, good day, the bacon.
1982000	2008000	But, but Aaron would kind of like slide, you know, slide into the French Uber and just be like, and the driver'd be like, huh? But, but, but then like a couple minutes later, he'd be like, oh, my, my, and she'd be like, oh, my, my, my, my, my. Are they both doing a bit or they're like talking to each other about stuff.
2008000	2021000	And then Aaron, Aaron got like bronchitis. She thought she might have pneumonia. So she got up in the middle of the night. She's like coughing up a lung and she got on the phone and then she's like, uh, I can't do an impression of it because it's like fluent French.
2021000	2031000	I don't know. She's like speaking to somebody about getting a doctor. Like she called somewhere in Paris, like a regular person trying to get a doctor and was like, oh, sweet dream.
2031000	2044000	It was just sweet dream a lot. Like, what the fuck? Jesus Christ. She's speaking French about dying and being sick and stuff. Like it was like, she took out sticks and made a fire.
2044000	2054000	And then, and then she puked at a very size. Well, we'll let her tell that story.
2054000	2059000	Yeah. I mean, you know, what, what, what else am I going to talk about? Who cares? Right.
2059000	2079000	Uh, uh, uh, why don't we bring up my, uh, my, my honeymooned wife, uh, Aaron McGathey.
2080000	2082000	Did you guys do a French style? You kiss both cheeks?
2082000	2088000	Uh, we didn't.
2088000	2090000	Are you all better now? You're healthy again?
2090000	2102000	I am. Uh, just recently though, I still have a little thing in my throat. And today I did a like a channel one on one pilot and there was an older woman there.
2102000	2114000	Uh, this actress who was brought in who I don't think knew anybody and I, and I coughed and like she had done some very nice woman, but she had done some like very like six seeming things earlier that made me kind of worried about her health.
2114000	2126000	Like there was a fog machine and she said, oh, is something on fire? And I said, oh no, that's a, that's a, it's a fog machine and it's just, it's just vapor.
2126000	2136000	And she was like, okay, okay. Don't want anything to be on fire. And I was like, yeah, no one does great. Um, but then 10 minutes later, she, she looked at me like she was looking through the pizza.
2136000	2151000	Also she was like examining the pizza, which is strange, but she had eaten pizza and was just looking, seeing all the pizza. And then she looked at me and she said, is something on fire? And I was like, ha ha ha ha. She was like, is something on fire?
2151000	2161000	Uh, no, it's a fog machine. It's vapor. And she was like, okay. Um, but then five minutes later I coughed and she said, you need to get some help.
2161000	2166000	So I guess I'm still a little sick.
2166000	2174000	Yeah. You don't, you don't sound that good. Like in bed at night.
2175000	2182000	Oh no, we, we, we sleep together.
2182000	2187000	But we're not always sleeping.
2187000	2193000	Right. Because she keeps coughing.
2193000	2198000	Well, then why don't you start living?
2198000	2214000	Uh, yeah, no, I got, I was very, very sick and I was very proud of myself for calling the French doctor and the French doctor came and gave me, prescribed me some antibiotics and they made me violently ill.
2214000	2225000	And I threw up in Versailles after doing a ton of research and trying to convince Dan to go. And it was very self-righteous about how great I am about enjoying historical things.
2225000	2233000	And I threw up right on history and was ushered out, escorted out while the tour continued and I just slept.
2233000	2237000	Oh, I didn't tell you this because I was very ashamed and I thought you'd be embarrassed.
2237000	2244000	But when I was escorted out, I was so sick. And you know, when you're sick, you want to put your face up against something cold.
2244000	2270000	And so I was, I was lying in the courtyard of Versailles with my face just on the stone, literally like behind the golden gates where we're living the 16th for summary internet and, and, and the, the, the people of France looked in wanting to be there because that's what the French Revolution is.
2270000	2271000	Right.
2271000	2281000	I'm just kidding. Anyway, I was lying, lying on the ground at Versailles, but put my very fancy coat over me so people didn't think I was homeless and it worked out.
2281000	2284000	Homeless people hate insulation.
2284000	2290000	Well, I was just like, well, I mean, because I definitely looked like there was something wrong, but I was on the inside of the gate.
2290000	2295000	So I clearly bought a ticket, but people don't usually lie on the ground with their face on the stone at Versailles.
2295000	2299000	So you put your coat over yourself so that people just thought you were a corpse.
2300000	2305000	Well, I put it, I put it like over my shoulder and then I had like out like a, like my little guidebook.
2305000	2308000	So it looked like I was kind of doing something.
2308000	2309000	I was very sick.
2309000	2317000	You know, when you position yourself in a sleeping position, when you have to sleep and you want people to think that you're doing it on purpose, it was that kind of thing.
2317000	2320000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
2320000	2326000	Well, have you ever tried to fake sleeping and in a, in a educational situation?
2327000	2329000	You mean like putting your, putting your head down?
2329000	2330000	Yeah, yeah.
2330000	2332000	Like, like, like in school, you're sleeping.
2332000	2339000	You have your hand on your, on your face and just your head down and then a book and you learn how to hold a pen while you're sleeping.
2339000	2341000	So it looks like you're doing something.
2341000	2342000	Yeah.
2342000	2344000	I'm just glad you didn't make me go.
2344000	2345000	I mean, I.
2345000	2346000	You didn't go?
2346000	2347000	No, I don't.
2347000	2348000	I don't.
2348000	2349000	I don't.
2349000	2350000	You said you don't.
2350000	2352000	You're like, why would I want to go to some guy's house?
2357000	2364000	And the, and the, and the only answer is, oh, this guy was really rich.
2364000	2365000	No.
2365000	2366000	All right.
2366000	2367000	I'm not going to have this.
2367000	2369000	I told everybody what to do.
2369000	2370000	Yeah.
2370000	2371000	Yeah.
2371000	2372000	That's.
2372000	2375000	So, so you, you, you didn't go.
2375000	2377000	No, I'm not going to go to first sigh.
2377000	2381000	What do you also hates Paris?
2381000	2384000	I mean, why is it so absurd?
2384000	2386000	Because it's like, we cut their heads off.
2386000	2388000	Like we hated them.
2388000	2390000	We didn't do that.
2390000	2396000	We being modern people, we turned our back on the idea of all that shitty fucking.
2396000	2397000	Yeah.
2397000	2400000	Well, I wasn't going because I was like, oh, the way they did that or wallpaper.
2400000	2410000	I'm walking through and I'm like, oh, this is.
2410000	2426000	This is where, this is where the Royal court, uh, met for the last time when they, when they said, you know, uh, Louis the 14th and Marie Antoinette, you have to, you have to stay or you have to stay hostage because we have this big list of people who are going to be beheaded.
2426000	2429000	And they're, you know, these moments, so many moments.
2429000	2439000	And, uh, you know, Marie Antoinette is, is Austrian and she's 14 years old and she's married right away and she goes into her room and she, she's like, ah, this is, this is my life.
2439000	2440000	And my life is perfect.
2440000	2443000	And my life is, or my life is, my life is terrible.
2443000	2444000	Oh, so many dresses.
2444000	2445000	And she has no idea what's going on.
2445000	2450000	And you get to be in these halls or people have been.
2450000	2453000	I mean, I care more about that, that stuff.
2453000	2454000	Obviously.
2454000	2456000	Do you think Peter Weller would have enjoyed that?
2456000	2457000	Well, of course.
2457000	2458000	Yeah, yeah.
2458000	2459000	That's what I mean.
2459000	2466000	That's the amazing thing about Peter Weller is he's, he's part Dan part Aaron all.
2466000	2468000	He cares about architecture.
2468000	2469000	He was a robocop.
2469000	2470000	Yeah.
2470000	2472000	I mean, it's also, it's also magnificent.
2472000	2475000	What did you do instead, Dan, that day?
2475000	2484000	Uh, at that, well, at that particular time when she was at Versailles, I found a bar I could drink in, in Paris because it was a British themed bar.
2484000	2487000	So it was just made to be like a pub.
2487000	2489000	I can't like, like, it's hard.
2489000	2493000	They don't have like a burgeoning cocktail culture in Paris.
2493000	2494000	They do.
2494000	2495000	I mean, I went to pressure the first time.
2495000	2498000	I've never, I've never spent any time there, like alone.
2498000	2501000	So I went there alone in the first week of December.
2501000	2504000	And I had friends there that are these Parisian rock and rollers.
2504000	2505000	They're very cool.
2505000	2508000	And they kind of showed me around the first night and then it was on my own.
2508000	2511000	And I kind of like, I kind of failed.
2511000	2513000	Like, I wasn't like, like doing anything cool.
2513000	2517000	I was seeing some sites, went to, went to see the museums and whatnot.
2517000	2524000	But like, I was intimidated by the, I don't speak any French except the how do you do's and pleases and thank you's and stuff.
2524000	2528000	And I asked my friends, like, how come girls here just do not look at you?
2528000	2531000	Like, as in New York a week before, people like flirt with each other.
2531000	2537000	They make eye contact and they look at you and either have a fuck that guy or that guy's good looking or like, or they don't care.
2537000	2539000	In Paris, girls are gorgeous.
2539000	2541000	Everybody's fucking skinny for some reason.
2541000	2544000	And they all, they're all smoking and nobody makes eye contact.
2544000	2547000	And my friend who's from, he goes, he's a Jeff, he's a girl in Paris.
2547000	2549000	She looks at you one time.
2549000	2552000	That means she is very interested in you.
2552000	2557000	If she looks at you a second time, that means she is going to fuck you.
2557000	2560000	And I said, I didn't get the fucking first look yet.
2560000	2563000	And then the last day I was there, I went to this fancy cake place.
2563000	2567000	It was like, like a gato, something, you know, like, like a, what do you call it?
2567000	2568000	Patisserie?
2568000	2569000	Patisserie.
2569000	2570000	And really fancy place.
2570000	2575000	I found out a way to get French girls to look at you, walk around with a really nice box of cake.
2575000	2579000	I had a white box with gold lettering and girls just like turning their heads.
2579000	2582000	They want to know what's in that fucking box.
2582000	2583000	So did you.
2583000	2585000	So if they're...
2591000	2592000	Oui.
2593000	2598000	So I went to a club one night and there was, on the carpet, this place is called Chez Castel.
2598000	2601000	And the carpet is all dicks, pussies and tits.
2601000	2603000	Like, this is the ornate carpet.
2603000	2606000	If you look at it closely, it's all this weird, horny thing.
2606000	2608000	And down in the basement, there's this piano.
2608000	2612000	And it was Serge Gainsburg's old piano where he used to go play it kind of as his second home.
2612000	2615000	And there's cigar, a cigarette burns from his cigarettes on it.
2615000	2617000	I went there one night and there was nobody there.
2617000	2620000	On the last night I was there, I met these people.
2620000	2626000	And they took me, I went to La Perouse, this place, like right on the Seine,
2626000	2629000	which is like from the 1700s and like Victor Hugo used to go there.
2629000	2633000	And I just did my old experiment of just going to a place and posting up,
2633000	2635000	sitting at one place all night long.
2635000	2637000	No one talked to me for two hours.
2637000	2640000	And at the end, they're like, they kicked everybody else out and they go, you can stay.
2640000	2643000	And then at the end, they're like, there's a girl there that I love.
2643000	2644000	She was so beautiful.
2644000	2646000	And she actually made eye contact with me.
2646000	2649000	And she was like the DJ there, or one of the DJs.
2649000	2652000	And they took me, they go, you come to this club with us.
2652000	2653000	I go, should I meet you there?
2653000	2655000	And they go, no, no, you walk with me.
2655000	2659000	And we went there and down in the basement, where I'd been before,
2659000	2662000	I was filled with people, smoky, people playing piano.
2662000	2664000	Girls start taking their shirts off.
2664000	2667000	And guys lighting cigarettes, when they're dancing with their shirts off,
2667000	2669000	it was so fucking French, I couldn't believe it.
2669000	2672000	They were lighting the women on fire?
2672000	2673000	No, no.
2673000	2674000	There was a girl.
2674000	2675000	She took her shirt off.
2675000	2676000	She's laying on the piano.
2676000	2680000	And a guy that she doesn't know, it's a picture on my Instagram.
2680000	2683000	And this guy, this really good looking guy, lights a cigarette and puts it in her mouth.
2683000	2686000	And on my Instagram, she's like, who is that guy?
2686000	2687000	She didn't know that guy.
2687000	2692000	They all took me to this party afterwards, where it was three girls,
2692000	2697000	the girl who was one of the DJs, and this two guys in this crazy house,
2697000	2702000	it was like if M.C. Escher and Frank Geary made a really gay Parisian house together.
2702000	2706000	Stairways that went nowhere, you have a push on a wall and the whole thing opens up,
2706000	2709000	and some floors are glass, and you look through, you can see down in the bathroom,
2709000	2712000	or you can see through to that room, but you can't see into that room.
2712000	2716000	Yeah, you can look from one room into another, but some rooms you can't see into.
2716000	2720000	And the top floor is one giant bed.
2720000	2726000	And I get up there and they go, one of the girls goes, Jeff, you are gay, no?
2726000	2727000	And I said, no.
2727000	2731000	And they ripped my coat off, ripped my jacket off, ripped my tie off,
2731000	2734000	and all of them took their fucking shirts off and started making eye with me.
2734000	2735000	How is the pastry?
2735000	2738000	Huh?
2738000	2741000	And then, so while that's happening, this guy comes up,
2741000	2745000	this guy named Aurelion, he comes up and he lays down,
2745000	2748000	like 15 feet away from us, lays down sideways and smoking a cigarette,
2748000	2752000	and one of the girls and friends are like, Aurelion, do you want to come and join?
2752000	2755000	He goes, no.
2755000	2759000	I just sat there smoking and digging it.
2759000	2761000	Wait, he was just...
2761000	2762000	He wanted to watch.
2762000	2763000	He wanted to watch.
2763000	2769000	So, a couple of nights ago, I was telling this story to some friends of mine,
2770000	2772000	because a friend from France was showing up,
2772000	2775000	his famous hairdresser, Charlie LeMendou, who does Lady Gaga's hair,
2775000	2778000	and he's like a super duper famous French hairstylist.
2778000	2781000	And he shows up and I just told this story.
2781000	2783000	And I said, do you know La Paris?
2783000	2785000	And he goes, yeah, I do a night show once a month.
2785000	2787000	I promote a night show.
2787000	2789000	I go, oh, I was just telling them about this girl.
2789000	2791000	And he goes, was it Amre?
2791000	2792000	I go, yeah.
2792000	2795000	And he goes, yeah, she rapes all the men.
2799000	2804000	It was fucking French.
2804000	2806000	And my car came at 8.30.
2806000	2810000	It was fucking French.
2810000	2812000	They had written all over me.
2812000	2815000	I had writing all on my arm and on my face and my neck and my shirt.
2815000	2818000	Like, they kept writing on me.
2818000	2820000	Like, this is the back of the pocket square.
2820000	2824000	And I got to the airport and I was just covered in writing.
2824000	2827000	And the French guys at the airport seemed like that was just another day
2827000	2831000	at the office for them.
2831000	2833000	It does get very French in Paris.
2833000	2837000	It does.
2837000	2840000	It's like these French have got a different word for everything.
2840000	2842000	We were there on New Year's Eve.
2842000	2846000	And I had some friends that we ran into from New York.
2846000	2850000	And we were in this club up until 5 AM.
2850000	2853000	And when we walked in there, we were like, oh, cool club.
2853000	2854000	And it was all red.
2854000	2857000	And the music, the music's terrible.
2857000	2858000	Paris?
2858000	2861000	Well, I mean, sure, not across the board.
2861000	2862000	But where we were, it was pretty bad.
2862000	2869000	It was like a whatever the what it's called when you type it words into a website
2869000	2874000	and then it gives it back to you.
2874000	2875000	Translation?
2875000	2876000	Yeah, like a translator.
2876000	2878000	But what you want to say.
2878000	2881000	Like a Stephen Hawking like automated.
2881000	2885000	I know there are many obvious words that I'm forgetting.
2885000	2890000	Anyway, we were in this place where this DJ was typing words into some sort of
2890000	2898000	child's toy or a deaf person's toy and was playing it with a heavy beat
2898000	2899000	underneath.
2899000	2901000	And everyone was really into it.
2901000	2907000	Except for the deaf people, ironically, even though their life is a game.
2908000	2922000	We were at the door and I speak very little French, but it was at the door and
2922000	2926000	like spoken enough French to the guy that somehow like we got into this club
2926000	2929000	that was like a private party and everyone's dancing and then everyone's
2929000	2930000	making out.
2930000	2933000	And then people are taking people's faces and saying, no, you make out.
2933000	2934000	No, you make out.
2934000	2935000	Like we're not a part of this.
2935000	2936000	Like we're very obvious.
2936000	2941000	We're just watching all of this happen.
2941000	2945000	But every everyone is there's this just this very free energy.
2945000	2949000	And I was like, I read like a very special free club, but I think it's just
2949000	2950000	like a French thing.
2950000	2956000	But the height of it was when a guy came downstairs who looked like a jolly old
2956000	2961000	elf and he had this sack full of presents.
2961000	2966000	Like when you when you watch if you were to watch a 70 a biopic about a very
2966000	2970000	famous hairdresser from the 70s, this would be that guy.
2970000	2974000	He came down wearing a beret, which they wait.
2974000	2975000	They do.
2975000	2976000	They really well.
2976000	2977000	And it was crazy.
2977000	2978000	Like it just seems so on the nose.
2978000	2979000	They actually they do wear berets.
2979000	2980000	They wear berets.
2980000	2982000	I actually I heard one totally non ironic.
2982000	2985000	Ooh la la.
2985000	2990000	I went to McDonald's and they said Bon Appetit.
2990000	2995000	And I was like, ah, wait, wait.
2995000	2996000	I have a question.
2996000	2999000	Why did you go to a fucking McDonald's in Paris?
2999000	3004000	Well, because everything was was we we we went because the kids that Dan met at
3004000	3008000	that bar were talking about it like it was the most amazing restaurant in the
3008000	3009000	world.
3009000	3010000	And we did.
3010000	3011000	I thought it was funny.
3011000	3012000	I did it.
3012000	3013000	The kids call it Mac doh.
3013000	3016000	But anyway, this guy.
3016000	3019000	The guy is wearing the guy's wearing this beret.
3019000	3021000	And he comes down.
3021000	3024000	He comes down into this dance floor.
3024000	3026000	And this club this club is called Bonnie and Clyde.
3026000	3027000	And it's in the pig.
3027000	3031000	And it's like the cool like hipster club.
3031000	3037000	And the bathroom was crazy.
3037000	3040000	The bathroom is crazy because you like wait in line for the bathroom.
3040000	3045000	And you get to where like it would split off into like men's or women's or
3045000	3047000	two stalls or three stalls.
3047000	3049000	There's one stall that has a door.
3049000	3052000	And then there's like a trough or urinal.
3052000	3053000	But it's like right there.
3053000	3057000	So if you're standing in line and a guy just has to pee like he'll stand there
3057000	3058000	and pee.
3058000	3063000	But the more shocking thing about this became if you were a man who had to
3063000	3066000	shit, you had to wait for this other thing.
3066000	3067000	And I learned very quickly.
3067000	3071000	I learned a lot of French for I am so sorry.
3071000	3074000	I am going to shit before you.
3074000	3076000	Anyway this guy comes down with a beret.
3076000	3079000	And then you would take someone's butt and go like now you shit over here.
3079000	3080000	And you pee.
3080000	3082000	You pee in his shit.
3082000	3086000	No it was it was just weird because like I mean it was weird for a second.
3086000	3091000	But when I say weird I mean it was it was actually like this this really like
3091000	3095000	neat human moment where it was like yeah we're all in this together.
3095000	3098000	Like knowing when a man has to shit.
3098000	3101000	But then also the women get to maintain this mystery of like you don't know
3101000	3103000	what's gonna happen in there for me.
3103000	3107000	But like for a man like it's like I poop will be coming out of my butt.
3107000	3111000	And that is why I am waiting in this line and poop will come out of my butt
3111000	3114000	before you do whatever mystery you'll do in there.
3114000	3115000	Anyway this guy came down.
3115000	3120000	You guys had a very different Paris experience than I had.
3120000	3125000	This guy had a beret and a cape and came to the middle of the dance floor
3125000	3131000	and a cape a long cape and and not not heels but men's heels.
3131000	3136000	Like when you see pictures of like restoration heels like French restoration
3136000	3140000	heels like they were clearly men's shoes but he was wearing heels and just
3140000	3143000	started very sincerely voguing.
3143000	3150000	And I look I was looking around and every no no reaction no reaction.
3150000	3155000	And it was it was amazing and beautiful and like he saw me looking at him
3155000	3159000	and then was like all right this is the time when I do this when I do this for
3159000	3162000	you and I just sat there while this man vote for me.
3162000	3164000	Well while while you're waiting to take a shit.
3164000	3166000	No.
3166000	3171000	This is in the yeah this is in the this is in the in the dance the dance room.
3171000	3172000	All right.
3172000	3173000	All right.
3173000	3175000	Well.
3175000	3176000	Yeah.
3176000	3178000	So Dan Dan thumbs up thumbs down on Paris.
3178000	3179000	What do you like?
3179000	3180000	I'm not a Paris man.
3180000	3185000	But you know I was I wasn't a New York man for for several New York visits
3185000	3190000	and then Dino showed me the the Dino side of New York and now I love New York.
3190000	3194000	I someone will have to you know Paris is very intimidating to me.
3194000	3201000	It's it's it's for for no I'm absolutely of no like like like I don't funnel my
3201000	3206000	fear of Paris into me going oh Paris is shitty.
3206000	3209000	I think the deal with Paris is if I could totally make a bunch of sweeping
3209000	3213000	generalizations and speculations is that like even though it's a city that
3213000	3217000	everyone on the planet wants to go to the unlike other cities that everyone
3217000	3221000	on the planet wants to go to they have they've refused to succumb to the
3221000	3223000	tourist industry.
3223000	3227000	They the tourist culture like they all know English but that's where you get
3227000	3231000	that that that stereotype of like well you have to try speaking French otherwise
3231000	3232000	they don't like you.
3232000	3236000	I finally got that when I was there I was like I think putting myself in their
3236000	3241000	shoes like oh suppose you're suppose you're Paris and you just want to be
3241000	3245000	New York like like people in New York don't bend over backwards for people that
3245000	3247000	don't speak English.
3247000	3251000	Yeah like like in my experience like going to Italy people like will throw their
3251000	3255000	arms around you as a stranger in some in also Paris is not all of France like
3255000	3259000	south of France is very different than being in Paris where people like it's
3259000	3263000	it's more provincial and it's less like in Paris people are busy they got shit
3263000	3267000	to do like and also being an American doesn't charm them that's not enough on
3267000	3269000	its own to be interesting to them they got shit to do.
3269000	3273000	I went to go buy a razor so I left my razor in New York and I went to a very
3273000	3277000	busy like drug store and I found the razor and I was hoping that I could just
3277000	3282000	walk up put the razor on the thing she would type it up I would see a number I
3282000	3286000	would overbid on euros she would give me a lot of change and that would be the
3286000	3290000	end of it and she goes she rings it up I put them on and she goes
3290000	3296000	I said I said I don't know and she's like why not?
3297000	3304000	In perfect English I go I don't know I don't speak French and she goes
3304000	3311000	like why? And I said one phrase I know I said I don't know I don't speak French
3311000	3317000	like one day I hope I can speak French well and she goes I don't know
3317000	3323000	like one day like you're fucking she's like you're here now I go lady give me
3323000	3329000	the fucking razor she fucking died laughing like she loved it like they'll
3329000	3333000	give you shit you can give them shit back like I just said I hope I go one
3333000	3336000	day I'll speak French well and she was giving me shit back like they they
3336000	3341000	they're not mean they just got shit to do and I think that they're quite
3341000	3344000	charming there well I think there's just also it's a city that people go to to
3344000	3350000	have like fantasies and dreams and things like but it's not like like like
3350000	3355000	like barfing in Versailles like when you go to Venice every other building is
3355000	3360000	either a hotel or a purse store there's it's obvious that like like there's not
3360000	3365000	obviously tourism is like late it's in it's it's infused the culture like if
3365000	3368000	you're gonna if you're gonna roll your eyes at the idea that you have visitors
3368000	3374000	then you you're an idiot as a Venetian I think like you the die is cast for them
3374000	3378000	and and for Paris there they're like look I understand that you're in a waking
3378000	3383000	dream because the Eiffel Tower is over my shoulder but I yeah I got shit to do
3383000	3387000	and I'm not I'm not being a prick to you I'm just saying like when you wander
3387000	3391000	into my my my bar and you're kind of like you know you you're just in a
3391000	3395000	different mindset as a tourist you're like like like oh look like you're you're
3395000	3399000	off work you're not working and the it's yeah whatever we've beat this horse
3399000	3404000	dead but it's a I think there's just cities that cities that make that choice
3404000	3408000	like they it's a binary thing almost they go like okay let's face it people
3408000	3412000	are coming here to visit I can't I could see you liking it because I think that's
3412000	3416000	kind of the the great thing about it because I think that it that's a turn off
3416000	3419000	about the touristy stuff obviously is like the selfie stick so you have to buy
3419000	3422000	the selfie stick take the selfie stick but it's kind of neat to just kind of
3422000	3426000	get comfortable enough you know it would be it would be yeah several several
3426000	3430000	like visits whatever but I what I was blown away by is I had that box of cake
3430000	3436000	and I went to like I went to a little cafe and said like near the Eiffel Tower
3436000	3441000	I said I asked a waiter is it okay if I eat this here and it's like only if you
3441000	3446000	share with me like everybody wanted in that fucking cake box I took two little
3446000	3451000	this is the story that blew Jeff away the story where he went into a sex
3451000	3463000	dungeon. I know he didn't say it but time travel was implied. So I just like that the
3463000	3469000	precursor to that the cake story was this is what blew me away this is what
3469000	3476000	blew you were at the airport and it said like horror on your forehead.
3477000	3482000	You should write a new like a new manual for men to replace the game which is
3482000	3489000	such a pile of bullshit would just called the box of cake and we can just see men
3489000	3493000	carrying around beautiful boxes of cake. I went to the what's the what's the
3493000	3499000	museum or the like the Les Invalides where all the doors say where like Napoleon's
3499000	3502000	tomb is where all the armory and all that shit is I walked in there and then I
3502000	3508000	went I had I didn't finish all the cake and so I went into the the set at
3508000	3515000	Napoleon's grave with the cake and Napoleon was like oh you're going to share
3515000	3522000	that with me. I was in Napoleon's tomb with my half-eaten cake and then I had
3522000	3527000	the box and then I went I went across the road to the Musée Rodin and I wanted to
3527000	3532000	see the the statue of Honoré de Balzac and so I walk in there and these two
3532000	3536000	security guards come charging at me and I'm assuming they're gonna go you can't
3536000	3541000	you can't bring food in here and they're like what is this and I opened up a
3541000	3545000	show them and I said okay he was like one guy's like no it's okay you can
3545000	3551000	bring food into the thing and then I said no no you have to give it to me.
3552000	3561000	I was like for two euro you walk in the fucking Musée Rodin gallery and you're out in the
3561000	3564000	fucking garden and there's a fucking Le Pincero there's this thinker by Rodin
3564000	3567000	and I'm fucking eating my cake and no one gave a shit like you couldn't bring
3567000	3571000	cake into a museum in the States it was the best and then girls walk by into
3571000	3576000	smoke and they fucking want to know about that cake. Was this cake made out of
3576000	3582000	diamonds? What kind of cake? It did oh it's so good. Come on we got we're you guys we
3582000	3587000	keep a tight schedule on this show and we got we got important shit to talk
3587000	3591000	about with Spencer Crittenden bring them out.
3591000	3610000	Hey guys you know wouldn't you believe it I read a fucking article about men
3610000	3616000	carrying cakes in public and it's a great way for men to get the female
3616000	3621000	experience of always having eyes on them you know because men aren't
3621000	3625000	traditionally stared out by everyone whereas women are and it's really hard
3625000	3630000	to kind of fathom that experience of all this constant attention but when a man
3630000	3636000	is holding a cake they get all that attention. Are you on PCP right now?
3639000	3645000	His mic's just a little a little up I think but wait doesn't this imply that all
3645000	3653000	women are Kathy? No no. Did you say you read an article did you really? Oh yeah
3653000	3657000	yeah I read an article. I love that yeah. Are you being glib or did you really read an article?
3657000	3664000	No why would I make up an article that I read? No this lady she she was like it's
3664000	3669000	probably really hard for for you know guys to fathom what it's like to always
3669000	3674000	be contemplating you know gazes on you and to how that changes your behavior
3674000	3677000	and just the way you hold yourself and the way you walk and then her partner
3677000	3682000	just was by chance carrying a cake and noticed that everyone was staring at him
3682000	3686000	and they talked about it and she made this not exactly scientific test where
3686000	3692000	she got guys to carry various baked goods in public and like a plate of
3692000	3700000	cookies you know no nothing nothing an exposed cake oh boy look out like a
3700000	3704000	birthday style cake yeah like on a stand do you think it's does the article talk
3704000	3709000	about is the idea because it's because of the psychological ramifications the
3709000	3713000	mystery behind it or is it because everyone just wants that cake I think
3713000	3717000	that they said it was it was part of that it was both it was some people wanted
3717000	3720000	the cake and wanted to make jokes about getting the cake and other people seemed
3720000	3724000	like they just wanted to wait for someone to drop a lot of times the men
3724000	3728000	look at women that they want to fuck it looks like they want to eat them yeah
3728000	3734000	so that it's comparable I don't know if you guys Dan you don't strike me as a
3734000	3741000	person that buys flowers 9-11
3741000	3746000	I love the idea of someone walking in for the first time and being like what the fuck
3746000	3752000	celebrating 9-11 Dan actually buys flowers very frequently
3752000	3756000	but if you're walking down what walked down the street like in a busy like in
3756000	3760000	like New York or Seattle or big town walking down the road with with flowers
3760000	3765000	in your hand is aphrodisiac to everybody like everybody likes or people just like
3765000	3770000	oh that guy thought about something at somebody else I was what I was my I was
3770000	3776000	my diets cheat day yesterday and I went to a froyo place and I got the biggest
3776000	3781000	bucket they had and I filled it I filled it a quarter of the way through and then
3781000	3786000	I put all peanut butter cups and then I filled it another half way through and
3786000	3791000	I put all peanut butter cups and a little bit of crushed peanut butter cup and then
3791000	3795000	I filled it the rest way through and I was just walking through Las Feliz with it
3795000	3801000	with with like it was it was obvious that I wasn't like taking it to a family
3801000	3806000	it had one spoon in it what did the side of it say it says something like just
3806000	3816000	for me treating myself today a special day I know it's a novelty I think it's
3816000	3821000	a cousin of the concept because of the prop I was carrying I did feel like all
3821000	3828000	of this extra meaning to everybody I wasn't allowed to just be in in a in a
3828000	3834000	in a shell as I walked past people I wasn't allowed to just be anonymous like
3834000	3839000	I had this prop and I and so I was a story to any every everybody in every
3839000	3844000	window it was like it was like yeah laugh it up laugh it up and fuckers that's
3844000	3849000	that's just what boobs are yeah you know how I feel it's like I'm covered in
3849000	3855000	frozen yogurt all the time and candies
3855000	3863000	so so so I say in the Garfield dress so I mean like I
3864000	3871000	I don't know what's happening to me right now the the I wanted to we've been
3871000	3878000	talking forever about you know the the like trying a different game from my
3878000	3885000	childhood my high school days called shadow run yeah and Spencer's been like
3885000	3890000	reading the books and like I've seen him outside my writers room like sitting
3890000	3895000	there reading the shadow run books getting very excited and you like like
3895000	3898000	we're not gonna we're not gonna we're not gonna play it tonight but we're
3898000	3904000	also not gonna play D&D and we're we'll get hey fuck you people if you if you
3904000	3908000	want to know how it feels to get that kind of reaction take a tray of cookies
3908000	3915000	and wear them like a necklace and then maybe you'll start to get it but they
3915000	3923000	can't be oatmeal because that's it's the most masculine yeah the put put put
3923000	3929000	a pickle behind your ear like it's a pencil and you're like handy smurf and
3929000	3933000	then on the other ear just dangle a piece of pizza or where a sign where a
3933000	3939000	sign around your neck that says I forgot your cookies right yeah that pencil was
3939000	3945000	way too big to stay tucked behind that guy's ear just like a giant ass it's
3945000	3949000	like a microphone size pencil behind his ear but you don't know how stiff smurf
3949000	3956000	cartilage is it can't be that tough like can I can I just point out very quickly
3956000	3962000	that there's a man in the audience whose laugh is identical to judge Doom's laugh
3962000	3967000	Christopher Lloyd's character and Roger Rabbit right after when he's when you
3967000	3970000	find out he's a cartoon and he's turning into a cartoon he like has that maniacal
3970000	3979000	laugh Dustin Marshall pointed that out backstage how's that laugh go like that
3981000	3983000	well I don't want to do it that does that's not what it sounded like and that sounded
3983000	3987000	like I was making fun of you but you're that like is it a good laugh are you
3987000	3991000	enjoying this laugh are you I mean I I mean I've gone through at first I was
3991000	3998000	like huh and then I and then I was like oh and then I was like oh neat okay great
3998000	4003000	we're all and it's the truth yeah now I'm like now I love it now it's like being
4003000	4009000	covered in yogurt but my yogurt for my own in front of a mirror I'm not walking
4009000	4013000	down the street I'm in a room of mirrors and I just am seeing my own yogurt yogurt
4013000	4019000	yogurt's a lot grosser when it's not frozen covered in my own sugar-free
4019000	4024000	Greek yogurt Spencer do you have other logic problems with the Smurfs besides
4024000	4030000	the size of yeah I mean there's just the one lady Smurf right yeah and they don't
4030000	4037000	they lay eggs what okay but you know the lady Smurf was created by Gilgamesh
4037000	4043000	what's his name that's even more yeah isn't that even Gargamel well
4043000	4054000	it would be impressive did they come out of the mushrooms she was created by
4054000	4061000	Hammurabi Smurf where did it do they come like I don't know I know there's
4061000	4066000	three apples high but but didn't they are they what yeah they're supposed to be
4066000	4070000	three apples tall those are giant fucking mushrooms then they look like they could
4070000	4076000	be easily crushed underfoot but three apples man those are huge mushrooms you
4076000	4080000	can tell from the Pac-Man cartoon that they definitely ripped off Smurfs like
4080000	4085000	the they had a Gargamel figure I can't remember what was his name Mesmer on
4085000	4093000	maybe I didn't like that Pac-Man had hands and feet and had gloves on for
4093000	4098000	some reason he was supposed to do what's the cartoon supposed to be I'm not
4098000	4101000	a rhetorical question but what would that cartoon be like he's just floating
4101000	4107000	in space and he's like well I ate one dot time to eat another one like how do you get a hundred
4107000	4119000	episodes like what do you do at Christmas they were just gloves they were like kind
4119000	4123800	of got gauntlets yeah he had like big fancy gloves cartoons always seem to be
4123800	4130800	wearing gloves yeah cuz hands are scarier you could just draw the hands are like nature's
4130800	4135800	glove and then you could not have a little risky part of the glove and you'd have a hand
4135800	4143800	I didn't realize until I we were creating fills out the glove shape perfectly that's
4143800	4149800	why it's that shape sorry so I bet I know why I bet I know why they wear gloves maybe
4149800	4154800	because the old days like cell animation like the color the when you were the way you
4154800	4158800	made things move is by putting like transparency and type of transparency there was always
4158800	4161800	like a color differentiation between things that are moving and things that are static
4161800	4166800	yeah so making sure that anything that's going to be moving a lot is like a different color
4166800	4175800	than the thing next to it maybe is like a good idea just a thought so right right so
4176800	4182800	of course because we all grew up on animation but but but but I'm saying you're saying what
4182800	4186800	I'm saying this Cali here is that is that because it's a different cell because we've
4186800	4190800	all seen those like Scooby-Doo cartoons where it's like they're walking by a mountain and
4190800	4193800	you're like gee I wonder if there's a secret door there because it's like you know it's
4193800	4198800	gonna move so it's like different color different just slightly different shade because it's
4198800	4201800	like through the did I tell you guys I was I drove with an uber driver who was like a
4201800	4207800	he-man the second biggest collector of he-man cells the second biggest second biggest I
4207800	4210800	love that he knew he was the second I was like who's the first and he knew his name
4210800	4214800	and I suppose like was he angry yeah I was like are you guys enemies he's like no no
4214800	4221800	we are you know it's like he's like your cringer or whatever so anyways the I didn't
4221800	4224800	I didn't know until we did Rick and Morty that you have to pick the number of fingers
4224800	4229800	when you do a you know Justin had Justin I had to sit down and Justin's like okay it's
4229800	4234800	time for the finger conversation how many how many fingers are human beings gonna have
4234800	4240800	and the thing it was like well fucking five motherfucker and he's like well take it easy
4240800	4250800	there cowboy five fingers runs into money like the Simpsons have four fingers don't
4251800	4258800	it's like 25 percent more fingers you have to draw yeah it adds up I mean this budget
4258800	4267800	budgetary-minded stuff yeah well if you yeah yeah I'm not our field has four Spencer have
4267800	4273800	you played have you played shadow run before no would you what do you what's your impressions
4273800	4284800	off the bat of shadow run it's a great system the shot I believe that the shadow run universe
4284800	4297800	is it sure is Dan we'll be right back Squarespace it helps you make your own website I'm here
4297800	4307800	to talk about bonobos it takes place in the in the dark future of mankind corporations have taken
4307800	4314800	over the government mega corporations imagine that the but in addition to that in addition
4314800	4319800	to all that far-flung future business where you know there's all the hacking and the laser
4319800	4325800	swords and the implants and the bionic things there has been an awakening an awakening has
4325800	4330800	happened along the way yeah in addition to the world going to shit just for regular conventional
4330800	4337800	reasons there was an awakening or magic returned people started deforming turning into trolls
4337800	4342800	and elves and goblins and orcs and things and there's dragons and stuff that are like did I
4342800	4346800	read correctly that there's a dragon that gave an interview yeah there yeah that was those

4630800	4648800	no I'm I've got a funny thing to tell if someone is I'm like looking is 25 years or younger I'm that
4648800	4670800	yeah yeah yeah who is John Bobbitt oh let me tell you about John Bobbitt I don't know am I gonna learn when I'm 25 you'll be
4670800	4678800	taken to the woods and I'll tell you who John Bobbitt is to me he's the he's the most guaranteed comedy
4678800	4686800	sports suggestion from from from during the three-year period is that the guy that had his penis cut off
4686800	4693800	as well it's horrible it's horrible a few years ago he did that porn so everything's fine his penis reconstructive did
4693800	4702800	he do that 25 years ago no it's just a funny thing that a friend of mine pointed out that anyone under like 25 does not know that story that's
4702800	4713800	fascinating I want to know why well what happened 20 like when people are talking about yeah I know but when why why aren't they when were
4713800	4719800	they because when you were when it happened you were too young for your parents to tell you about a guy who's dick when it happened
4719800	4737800	oh it happened like early so 94 someone knows it in in why why was it notable yeah it was just like a like a bit like a highly publicized like true crime
4738800	4751800	seven stories about crazy mishaps involving penis severings I mean well it wasn't a mishap and she followed through it sounds like a mishap I heard about a woman I don't know where I heard
4751800	4763800	this maybe this is the thing everyone knows about it maybe something I just happened to have someone that I like a friend of a friend some a guy the woman didn't like him she was mad at him and she super glued his dick to his stomach
4764800	4780800	I think I think that was dialogue from reservoir dogs wasn't that's what you're thinking of I don't know Harvey Keitel told sorry I well it's that's pretty interesting concept though that you could stand that you can pick a random thing or not a random thing a very
4780800	4798800	decided thing because that's the thing you're looking for that there's a there there's a there's a momentum to pop cultural zeitgeist and the John Wayne Bobbitt thing like the foam of that surf like stops just before the toes of someone at a certain age I think that's very interesting.
4799800	4827800	Nancy Carrigan and Tony Hardin tell you about Nancy Carrigan wait was that figure skating yeah yeah I my roommate watched a documentary about that that I was listening to it's back in the news but had you heard about it before the documentary thing when I when I heard the incident I was like oh shit this was big when I was like seven or something like I definitely heard echoes of it but yeah I don't I don't really yeah doesn't it seem a little bit like I'm
4827800	4856800	maybe this is an illusion of we're in between them like I remember the last one I can remember is like October mom like every other there's like when there's when there's this thing that has no stakes to global society at all but it's just like everyone's talking about it because it's just like when you focus in on it it's it's everyone just wants to talk about October mom the it seems like we've been we've been in this reverse oasis of sandbar of like like are those days over because I think you might just be working too hard I mean they're just.
4857800	4865800	There are there are a lot I'm not doing it bad I mean there there are a ton of like true crime things that are constantly in the news that Casey Anthony was pretty.
4865800	4886800	I don't think Octomoms crime thing though well she she was like I don't know well she I guess I mean it's I mean it does it does count because it's like relative to what should be important to anybody it is one human life and it shouldn't it's it's like yeah our decision to focus in on it yeah Casey Anthony was a thing I guess those just pop up once in a while it just.
4887800	4910800	Feels like we've been through this patch right now is just fucking like darkness darkness dark like this river sticks of like like oh there's Bill Cosby's head floating I can recognize that but like like like everything is just more over just kind of like real like everything's kind of real right well and I didn't want to imply that the Casey Anthony story was fun no no no it's not fun.
4910800	4939800	Harder but but no there's bigger fish to fry than 350 million people focused on one verdict of one case to be sure so those there's like these things that pop up I was just wondering it seemed like in the but I think that's how you remember time like if I look back to the eighties I'll remember like all of those things these little maples that we danced around and I won't remember like the lava flow of actual society stuff just also like turns over so much more quickly that I used to.
4939800	4968800	Right now it's just like I think with every with every passing day it's like I don't know where the tipping points are or where they've been but it just it's like it seems like I almost want to like you either they're going to invent some phrase for it now or you can't even exist as a as an entertainment like kind of person like you have to make a decision in your life whether you're going to dip a toe in that river or not like you have to have a relationship with it because it's like there's just too much available reality.
4968800	4989800	Available reality now you can't you can't like there's there's a camera on everything everything is documented all of the all of the goo is seeping up it's all available to us I could I could I could tweet like like hey everybody like like we're going to have a sock hop tomorrow night let's have let's let's we're going to have a good old sock hop.
4989800	5016800	And I know that somebody out of three hundred fifty thousand people that are like like like looking at that I know that someone is going to go that's a that's a little bit of a bummer considering that someone got strangled by socks yesterday like or that or that or that you know socks like hashtag sock slaughter like like like like like like you know and I'll do a little googling and I'll be like you know what come to think of it my relationship with the word sock does need to change like I fucked up.
5017800	5030800	I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not being that that that that guy that's going like like give me a break let me say what I want I'm not I'm saying and I'm saying like you're just saying that Irish people are dirty little people dirty little potato people.
5031800	5039800	I'm going to get one of those I'm going to get one of those mouth swabs and mail it in so I can I can I hope I'm one of them I hope I'm one of those dirty potato people.
5040800	5047800	What is your hair that you're your lineage I don't know I got to find out I want to be a dirty potato person let's do it I'll get us I'll get us some some.
5048800	5062800	So there are my minds minds pretty clear I'll get you a swab yeah what do you what do you think you are you must know something I feel like I must be pretty Irish but then and then and then beyond that pretty Polish what if you found out that you were straight up one hundred percent Parisian.
5063800	5080800	You get a letter from the company and they're like Mr. Harmon no no a knock on the door sir we we've never done this before but we've never gotten a test back that's so conclusive you are from this cafe they printed.

5195800	5197800	Laura everybody thank you Laura thanks for coming.
5198800	5199800	Thank you the best birthday.
5200800	5202800	1985 bill Clinton is.
5204800	5207800	Bill Clinton is 99 bill Clinton is Bill Clinton Bill Clinton.
5209800	5212800	She walked so fast it's just a blur of Bill Clinton.
5214800	5215800	It's all I remember.
5216800	5217800	Did you say Bill Clinton is in 1999.
5218800	5219800	Yeah.
5220800	5222800	All right so it's been a shadow run late on us.
5225800	5226800	You guys are great at Segways.
5228800	5231800	Well what we have to talk about is what kind of characters we would like to play.
5232800	5233800	Yeah.
5234800	5241800	So yeah I mean there's there's a way you guys got to make the characters so in general there's kind of five roles.
5242800	5248800	The roles are kind of like classes but they're not really there's not strictly classes and shadow runs so.
5249800	5253800	The first role is the face you know he's the guy he's like Jeff Davis.
5254800	5260800	He knows people and he tells stories and he talks and you know he's that guy he knows you know that's a role.
5261800	5268800	Yeah it's whenever whenever there's a crew of people in a movie in a caper movie they go to a guy who knows some people.
5269800	5270800	That's the face man.
5271800	5288800	Yeah because because the word the title of the game shadow run comes from the idea that that in the future there's the corporations control like the world the mega corporations they can have their own armies and they have their own law and the world is kind of a mishmash of craziness and alliances and and stuff.
5289800	5299800	And there's and there's these mercenaries that dwell in the shadows that can you know if you if you need something done and you can't do it through legitimate channels.
5300800	5306800	You go you go to these people's shadow runners face man's an actual character from a team is there a.
5307800	5317800	It's all it's like they can I be be a be a bureaucracy yeah you can he's a troll is it in in shadow one is a troll and make the rules.
5318800	5324800	Okay so what else do you have the face man you got the troll you know trolls are a race Jeff.
5325800	5327800	You said there were no races classes.
5328800	5336800	Yeah there's no classes classes or what sorry okay there's the face after the face there's what I hate to refer to as the street samurai.
5337800	5340800	That's essentially a guy who owns weapons.
5342800	5352800	Yeah they're there the muscle you know sometimes they got rocket launchers sometimes they just got swords and sticks and shit but they use them for tasks street samurai street samurai.
5352800	5381800	They're fighters with weapons yeah okay then you got you got the decker that's your hacker that's kind of like the whole thing about the future is instead of the internet they got the matrix and the matrix is like this virtual overlaid world so like if I was looking in the matrix I'd see like a virtual mic stand and like a virtual table and then it would be like this is a mic stand made by Sony Corp and you know it's all virtual reality sort of thing and then the deckers they they hack that shit.
5382800	5395800	They have these little portable computers that can do illegal stuff and they can steal money and you know do do hacking things gotcha like hackers would I don't know they could disable your cyber eyes or something you know.
5397800	5406800	My cyber eyes yeah if you have them make of car and chatter you can get cyber eyes lots of people have like implants bionic implants.
5406800	5429800	Yeah okay so we got we got the face the street samurai the decker who decker then you got your rigger a rigger is like a hacker but they work with vehicles and machines because in this far flung future people don't really know how to drive everything just kind of drives automatically using this thing called grid guide which is essentially like if you had to do what ways told you to.
5430800	5448800	So it's just like that and so no one knows how to drive unless you like spent time learning how to drive and then the advance people are riggers where they can actually jump into the into the Internet and control vehicles from the inside like like go in and be the vehicle and they also control drones which are robots and stuff.
5448800	5477800	So that's the rigger then you got your magic users which are broken up into your shamans and your sorcerers as well as your ad apps and shamans are like you know they they pray to spirits and that's where they get their magic and sorcerers they're just wizards and shit and then ad apps are like they're like people that are really good at stuff in a magical way so like if you were if you could punch through a wall that would because you're like magically strong but you couldn't like shoot fireballs on the wall.
5478800	5479800	And stuff.
5483800	5484800	That's five right.
5484800	5485800	Yeah.
5485800	5486800	Yeah.
5486800	5487800	Yeah.
5487800	5488800	I have some more questions about the ad apps.
5488800	5489800	Yeah.
5489800	5496800	Like so so are you a certain kind of ad app would you be like I am like a muscley ad app that punches through walls.
5496800	5497800	Yeah.
5497800	5507800	Like there could be an ad app to like a master with a swordsman so like if you think of a swordsman who could like slice a grasshopper in half with his eyes closed that would be like an almost magical level of skill or if someone was like.
5508800	5519800	Someone could like be so good at card games or shooting guns or something that it really you know is it like shape shifting without shape shifting or you like absorb like you get to absorb.
5519800	5522800	It's like it's like Neo in the matrix I would say.
5524800	5526800	I tried Adam.
5526800	5527800	I tried.
5528800	5529800	I got one.
5531800	5534800	I tried to help you anyway.
5534800	5535800	Yeah.
5535800	5546800	Ad apps like ad apps are like there's a guy you know he's maybe an assassin and he's got magical abilities that augment his assassin ship.
5546800	5547800	OK.
5547800	5564800	But maybe there's a better because the like the there's probably a permutation of the class system that allows for just about any kind of character you would want to be.
5564800	5567800	So it kind of begs the question like what you know.
5567800	5568800	Yeah.
5568800	5574800	So knowing what little I've told you about the setting if you had a character concept that'd be a great place to start.
5574800	5587800	So like if I was if I was in the world of Shadowrun I'd be like the well mannered nerd who knows enough but not enough to save his own ass or you know like something like that.
5587800	5588800	You start.
5589800	5590800	We have to size ourselves up.
5590800	5591800	Yeah.
5591800	5594800	You start with like a tagline as your character concept.
5594800	5595800	Yeah.
5595800	5596800	You know.
5599800	5601800	That's a character concept.
5601800	5602800	It happened.
5603800	5606800	I wish you were a big fan of that movie Lucy.
5606800	5607800	I remember.
5608800	5610800	That's my favorite movie ever.
5610800	5612800	It was the dumbest piece of shit ever.
5614800	5616800	But it's so exhilarating.
5618800	5622800	But 10 minutes before the end of that movie Aaron said God damn it.
5622800	5624800	Why does this movie have to be ending.
5625800	5629800	I don't know the last time that I felt that you wanted Scarlett Johansson to keep turning.
5629800	5631800	I just wanted them to start improvising.
5631800	5632800	Yeah.
5632800	5639800	Like her go through the ground and then the earth she starts juggling the solar system and then eating it and then.
5640800	5652800	Quickly in that movie like like they make the big deal in that movie which is like Asian guys with guns like a totally no stakes deal lately.
5652800	5655800	Like it's about 20 percent of her brain.
5655800	5657800	She can just make everyone in the world fall down.
5657800	5658800	Right.
5658800	5662800	And then like for another hour and a half after that it's like now what's she going to do.
5663800	5669800	Well you can always make everyone fall down like that thing you do where you just kill the planet.
5669800	5671800	And then teleport.
5671800	5678800	Aaron was saying is this movie going to end with her like taking the sun out of the sky and throwing it at a guy.
5683800	5685800	Lucy you should check it out.
5686800	5694800	So the job of these shadow runners is like they're kind of like guns for hire the people that like.
5694800	5695800	Yeah.
5695800	5696800	They do illegal stuff.
5696800	5697800	The whole thing is OK.
5697800	5706800	There is this incident that happened where the Native Americans they formed their own state and they stole nuclear warheads and they're holding the whole world hostage.
5706800	5709800	And as a kind of a result of that.
5710800	5711800	Spencer really soon.
5711800	5712800	Really quick.
5712800	5722800	Spencer sent this email today explaining all of this and then I had some questions about the attitudes towards the other races and in the email you see you said well you know like everybody hates Native Americans.
5722800	5723800	And I thought.
5723800	5724800	That is not.
5724800	5730800	That is not the day that like your understanding of the world is that everyone hates Native Americans.
5730800	5731800	And I was like holy shit.
5731800	5732800	And I just like let it go.
5732800	5734800	But this isn't within the world.
5734800	5736800	It is not the diction I use.
5736800	5740800	I feel like Native Americans are getting a free ride in this country for too long.
5740800	5741800	No that's not.
5741800	5742800	That's not what he.
5742800	5743800	No.
5743800	5744800	He didn't say anything.
5744800	5747800	But I thought I may use those words exactly.
5747800	5748800	No no no.
5748800	5756800	Everyone in the world of Shadowrun is as racist against Indians because you know they they they took the world hostage with nuclear weapons.
5757800	5758800	OK.
5758800	5759800	And what like terrorists.
5759800	5761800	I'm not familiar with that.
5761800	5762800	Did that resolved that.
5762800	5763800	Yeah.
5763800	5767800	You know they shot missiles but the missiles didn't didn't didn't get to where they were going.
5767800	5769800	No one knows why.
5769800	5778800	So then as a result of that the the governments of the various nations were like shit man you companies you need to be able to protect yourselves.
5778800	5791800	And so they started hiring private armies and then they got this thing called extra territorial status which basically meant that corporations set the rules instead of the governments and then they formed their own government called the corporate court.
5791800	5801800	So as of that all the corporations started rewriting the rules and started getting all the money and start making everyone kind of into this you know these dystopian wage slaves.
5801800	5819800	So when everyone is kind of just slaves to corporations and corporations only have to play by the rules that they set when they don't want to play within those rules they hire shadow runs or shadow runners to do stuff like murder politicians or steal high tech shoes.
5822800	5824800	Those are going to be your first two missions.
5827800	5833800	Like a shadow run is one of these covert operations that shadow runners are basically mercenaries.
5833800	5834800	Yeah.
5835800	5836800	No.
5836800	5838800	We moonlight a shadow runner.
5838800	5844800	Well the thing is in the world you need this thing called an S.I.N. that's essentially like a credit card number that everyone has.
5844800	5846800	Well it's like a credit card in the social security number.
5846800	5853800	It's what the government's used to track you but shadow runners don't have those so they can kind of live outside of the world or outside of the law.
5853800	5856800	But as a result they can't actually have jobs in the normal way.
5856800	5860800	So the only way they make their living is with crime and with doing these runs.
5860800	5865800	If you are you're outed as a shadow and are you are you imprisoned like is it illegal to be one.
5865800	5868800	It is illegal to be one but that's why they always use false IDs.
5868800	5871800	So you'll probably be running with three or four false IDs.
5871800	5875800	So if someone's like oh that's Kyle Robertson where you're like I'm James Jamerson now.
5877800	5881800	So it is illegal but they have ways around it.
5881800	5886800	Oh you know who would be helpful in this is Demarj Brown. Is Demarj Brown here?
5886800	5887800	Demarj?
5888800	5890800	Demarj are you here?
5892800	5895800	There is a really big Demarj Brown fan over there.
5897800	5898800	Hopefully not too big.
5898800	5901800	I thought if we're going to make character are you going to be here next week?
5902800	5905800	I'm scrolling through my schedule right now.
5905800	5907800	It doesn't matter.
5907800	5910800	I just wanted to get the pudding stirred here a little bit.
5910800	5912800	We're making characters.
5912800	5915800	Now do we have to decide right now or should we sleep on this and go home?
5915800	5917800	Should I do some more research and think about this more?
5917800	5919800	Or should I fire from the hip and pick a character?
5919800	5921800	I mean I don't care.
5922800	5927800	I think for the presentation of it maybe we should come up with character ideas
5927800	5930800	and then if you change your mind we could go from there.
5930800	5932800	Just for the audience.
5932800	5935800	Like what you were saying when you were describing those five roles
5935800	5939800	what you mean by that is that...
5939800	5941800	Those are kind of skill sets.
5941800	5944800	In order for there to be a successful kind of typical mission
5944800	5947800	you kind of want those points covered.
5947800	5949800	Or at least a couple of them.
5949800	5952800	So what is the Faceman again?
5952800	5954800	He's the guy that you go to for what?
5954800	5956800	He just knows people.
5956800	5961800	So if it's like, oh I need to be smuggled into the sewers of Borneo.
5961800	5963800	He always has a cake box.
5963800	5965800	Yeah, he has a cake box.
5965800	5968800	Maybe he knows, maybe he has a guy who's high up in the business
5968800	5971800	so if you need to get some business intel
5971800	5975800	he knows what's going on at the Shiowase Corp for instance.
5975800	5978800	So he's like Huggy Bear and Starsky and Hutch.
5978800	5980800	Thank you Demarge.
5980800	5982800	He's like that thing that he said.
5982800	5985800	Demarge your hair has become tremendous as well.
5985800	5987800	You have the Dan Harmon's beard of hair.
5987800	5989800	I think it's all...
5989800	5991800	Just letting it fly man.
5991800	5992800	It's good stuff.
5992800	5994800	Is it easy to maintain?
5994800	5997800	Just let it sit there.
5997800	6000800	When it needs to be reordered I pull it all out
6000800	6003800	and it curls back in on itself over the course of a month.
6003800	6005800	I like it.
6005800	6008800	I mean obviously I'm going to be the Faceman of the group.
6008800	6010800	That seems pretty obvious.
6010800	6012800	That's obvious.
6012800	6014800	I've never been a magic user.
6014800	6017800	I've attempted to be a magic user because I've never done it.
6017800	6020800	Alright, so do you want to be a shaman or a sorcerer?
6020800	6023800	Shamans kind of revere spirits where sorcerers are like
6023800	6026800	this is a science to use magic.
6026800	6028800	They function...
6028800	6031800	Who wants me to be a shaman?
6031800	6034800	Who wants me to be a sorcerer?
6035800	6038800	I'll be a rigger.
6038800	6041800	Fuck it, I'm a sorcerer Spencer, I'm a sorcerer.
6041800	6042800	Alright.
6042800	6045800	Who's confused about the vehemence of the opinions?
6045800	6048800	Oh nobody, nobody, okay.
6048800	6051800	But also there's race, so there's dwarf and human.
6051800	6053800	I want to be a black sorcerer.
6053800	6054800	Okay.
6054800	6057800	Or a dirty Irish potato sorcerer.
6061800	6066800	I mean, so there's human and orc and troll and elf and dwarf.
6067800	6069800	Who's black too?
6071800	6074800	I imagine an elf sorcerer would be pretty good at being a sorcerer, right?
6074800	6075800	Yeah.
6075800	6077800	Who wants me to be an elf sorcerer?
6078800	6080800	Who has no opinion?
6082800	6084800	I'm a decker.
6085800	6091800	Spencer, could you, as a GM, could you give some advice on like
6091800	6099800	what would make us happiest as individuals when choosing what we are?
6100800	6103800	Are you saying, what character would you like to kill off less quickly
6103800	6105800	than your other character?
6107800	6111800	Should we be choosing characters that fit, I don't know,
6111800	6114800	like your opinion, obviously there's not a right or wrong.
6114800	6118800	I mean, if you think about a character in like a TV show,
6118800	6121800	it's like that could be summed up in like a thing
6121800	6124800	and then a character like that might be appealing to you.
6124800	6127800	So it's like, oh, she's the bubbly girl next door.
6127800	6130800	Like that could be like a kind of concept.
6130800	6134800	So whatever appeals to you as a concept of a character you might want to play,
6134800	6137800	even independent of abilities and stuff, that's what I'd write.
6137800	6140800	Do you have an opinion about whether people are most, I mean like,
6140800	6142800	because there's two philosophies.
6142800	6145800	One is you play a person who like you could never be in real life
6145800	6148800	and then the other is to like kind of play a mythologized version
6148800	6150800	of what you are in real life.
6150800	6151800	Yeah.
6151800	6153800	And they're both valid like for role playing,
6153800	6156800	but like do you, do you, what do you do when you play?
6156800	6158800	I play as little girl's man.
6161800	6162800	Really?
6162800	6163800	Yeah.
6163800	6164800	Perfect.
6171800	6172800	Too soon.
6172800	6175800	No, I play as, I play as a character.
6175800	6178800	I exclusively play as characters that are skinny.
6178800	6179800	Well, okay.
6179800	6180800	So.
6181800	6182800	I recommend that.
6182800	6184800	Do you play?
6184800	6185800	They can jump higher.
6185800	6189800	Do you play as, but I mean like, like as far as personality goes,
6189800	6193800	do your characters tend to be more like what you want to be or what you aren't
6193800	6194800	or what you dare not be.
6194800	6199800	Characters that let me utilize intelligence, you know, like, yeah.
6199800	6200800	Nobody.
6200800	6203800	I mean, as far as the, your relationship to that character, what kind of,
6203800	6204800	what should I do?
6205800	6209800	I'm saying like, I'm going to make a decision for myself right now,
6209800	6210800	only because I think this will be fun.
6210800	6214800	I want to be a 15 year old girl who is an elf sorcerer.
6214800	6215800	All right.
6215800	6216800	Yeah.
6216800	6220800	I want to be like, I got like a, like a, a young high school girl age.
6220800	6222800	Well, Aaron, it doesn't franchise.
6222800	6225800	This is like disaffected like little punk rock chick.
6225800	6227800	Well, finally teenage girls have a voice.
6228800	6229800	See what?
6232800	6236800	When, when we're playing, I mean, what do you tend to find yourself doing?
6236800	6240800	You know, like you, you, you, you, you certainly craft a lot of things.
6240800	6244800	Like you, you like to find, uh, yeah.
6244800	6247800	Well, I'm, I'm, I'm torn.
6247800	6251800	Uh, Adam, what I think you might enjoy playing a decker slash rigger
6251800	6255800	because there's a lot of go with it and make stuff up in hacking.
6255800	6256800	Yeah. I was kind of thinking that too.
6256800	6258800	Like see, like taking the existing world.
6258800	6259800	I would agree with that.
6259800	6263800	Like, like, like, oh, can I make that car do this or yeah.
6263800	6264800	Okay.
6264800	6265800	Cool.
6265800	6268800	Well, I mean, I mean, part, part of me really wants to play like,
6268800	6271800	so it was like something that I'm not, that I would really like to be like,
6271800	6275800	like a really short, strong immigrant man.
6278800	6280800	I did not expect that to get a laugh.
6280800	6281800	I feel like that's obvious.
6281800	6282800	I like deep down inside.
6282800	6285800	It's just funny how convicted you are.
6286800	6289800	There's a lot of phrases that are funny when you just say them.
6290800	6292800	Um, but then obviously like when I,
6292800	6295800	I really like crafting things and coming up with different things.
6295800	6297800	Maybe you should start with a name first.
6298800	6301800	What country, what country do you immigrate from?
6301800	6306800	Oh, just like an immigrant from an Eastern European country.
6306800	6307800	Well, good news.
6307800	6312800	Most of the Eastern European countries have been buried by radioactive sludge.
6312800	6315800	So there's great reason to emigrate from them.
6316800	6321800	Emigrate is a 21st century form of immigration where you,
6321800	6325800	you send yourself to a computer.
6325800	6327800	What I think I like within the game,
6327800	6331800	the things that I enjoy the most are like my character,
6331800	6336800	like pretending to be something or trying to talk to people.
6336800	6338800	I guess, I don't know.
6338800	6341800	I just like talking to people about how they feel.
6342800	6345800	That could be like the face man, you know, you'll,
6345800	6348800	you'll stroll up to the security guard and be all like,
6348800	6354800	Hey man, I'm here on an inspection and then you'll roll some dice and maybe
6354800	6355800	he'll believe it.
6355800	6360800	So that's always my favorite part of the adventure is when Aaron is in charge.
6362800	6363800	Go ahead, Aaron.
6363800	6364800	Go talk to the guy.
6364800	6365800	Okay.
6365800	6366800	Yeah.
6366800	6367800	Yeah.
6367800	6368800	All right.
6368800	6369800	So you're just, yeah.
6369800	6370800	I mean, well that, yeah, that would probably be a disaster.
6370800	6372800	Everyone would be really mad.
6372800	6375800	Hey, entertainment is a disaster.
6376800	6378800	It's what you enjoy.
6380800	6381800	Okay.
6381800	6383800	Well, I enjoy, I like talking to the other characters.
6383800	6384800	I also like magic.
6384800	6386800	Can I be a magic face?
6386800	6387800	Yeah.
6387800	6390800	I mean, they're like, we were talking about Adepts.
6390800	6394800	There's like an Adept face might be like a guy who, or a girl who's like so
6394800	6399800	charismatic and beautiful that it's beyond, you know, the normal world.
6406800	6407800	I think we have a winner.
6407800	6408800	That's a yes.
6408800	6409800	That is a yes.
6409800	6412800	I mean, like people are like, I mean, how did that happen?
6412800	6414800	I mean, look at that face.
6414800	6415800	Yes.
6415800	6416800	Yes.
6416800	6417800	I would.
6417800	6418800	Yeah.
6418800	6419800	Yes.
6419800	6420800	I would like that.
6420800	6421800	I.
6421800	6422800	Yes.
6422800	6423800	Okay.
6423800	6424800	Okay.
6424800	6427800	Harmon, what do you want to be?
6427800	6428800	Yeah.
6428800	6430800	Well, I'm just going to go.
6430800	6434800	I'll just go with my, my old, like when I played Shadowrun the first time, like
6434800	6437800	I, uh, you know, if his name is Jim Nightblade, that's fine.
6437800	6438800	Oh.
6438800	6439800	I have to return it.
6439800	6440800	Jim Nightblade.
6440800	6443800	Like I, like, uh, I guess he'd be a street samurai category because it just,
6443800	6445800	it's just more of like an assassin kind of guy.
6445800	6446800	Yeah.
6446800	6447800	You'd probably just have a lot of gear and stuff.
6447800	6448800	Yeah.
6448800	6453800	Like, uh, like, like specialty in, uh, stealth and like, uh, kill, kill, you
6453800	6454800	know, killing, killing.
6454800	6455800	Yeah.
6455800	6456800	Yeah.
6456800	6457800	Quiet.
6457800	6458800	Five o'clock shadow.
6458800	6461800	Uh, uh, very, very sexy, obviously.
6461800	6464800	Uh, but yeah, I'm not going to totally unintentionally.
6464800	6465800	Yeah.
6465800	6466800	I'm not going to physically describe them.
6466800	6469800	Uh, you'll, you'll, you'll get there.
6470800	6473800	Like, uh, kind of ripped and, uh,
6473800	6477800	You have, you have like old doodles of Jim Nightblade in your journal.
6477800	6478800	Yeah.
6478800	6483800	That is a promise if I find a doodle.
6488800	6489800	Very, very, yeah.
6489800	6490800	World, world weary.
6490800	6495800	Uh, uh, just design, write down any of those things.
6495800	6498800	That'll be like your duty to bring to the character, you know?
6498800	6499800	Yeah.
6499800	6505800	I'm just going to write down like six, four, 13, you know, numbers and shit.
6505800	6508800	What's, what's left to merge?
6508800	6511800	You can't be black.
6511800	6516800	Oh, can I be, uh, would I be, uh,
6516800	6522800	Is there some sort of cross between a street samurai and then, uh,
6522800	6526800	Almost like a Hager grab, like a, a person that mood re can read a mood,
6526800	6531800	can shift with the mood as the situation changes.
6531800	6534800	What can sense a mood change in the situation before it gets there?
6534800	6540800	Like he's highly perceptive or empathetic.
6540800	6541800	Yes.
6541800	6545800	If there was a, if we were going from A to B and in between that,
6545800	6547800	there were several different types of people to encounter,
6547800	6550800	or maybe is there somebody who would be like, uh,
6550800	6556800	since they can't have jobs that they would have.
6556800	6562800	We said you can't be black.
6562800	6565800	I'm not even, I don't get it.
6565800	6569800	I'm standing perfectly still for the people who can't read this at home.
6569800	6573800	Uh, sir, you know, characters in that world,
6573800	6576800	sometimes they're, they have these underground jobs,
6576800	6581800	like they're the greeter at a hotel or they're a greeter at a, like a casino,
6581800	6583800	it's an underground casino or something,
6583800	6585800	but they have all this other information.
6585800	6590800	So for people in that world, they have one face for people in the know.
6590800	6595800	They do something completely different and they always have this sort of broad
6595800	6598800	personality for the people in the regular road.
6598800	6601800	So hello, hi, hi, that kind of thing.
6601800	6603800	And then out of the other side of their mouth,
6603800	6605800	they're whispering vital information.
6605800	6607800	People are doing something else.
6607800	6611800	So they're like well read.
6611800	6613800	At the street level, maybe.
6613800	6617800	Is that a charisma thing?
6617800	6623800	What about a street samurai that can kind of convince other people,
6623800	6626800	that can change form in front of other people?
6626800	6632800	Do I write like the newspaper guy from Men in Black?
6633800	6635800	I'm a street samurai.
6635800	6640800	Yeah, that's a thing, definitely.
6640800	6646800	It sounds like what you're describing is just a guy who has this personality trait.
6646800	6648800	Like a precog that can walk around.
6648800	6649800	Like a what?
6649800	6650800	Like a precog that can walk around.
6650800	6654800	Oh, I don't know if there's anything like that quite,
6654800	6658800	there's not really psychic abilities so much as magic.
6658800	6661800	So just a street samurai.
6661800	6663800	All right, I'll be an everyman.
6663800	6667800	We got to figure out your guys' race.
6667800	6669800	What race do you want to be, Demorsch?
6669800	6673800	I want to be Norwegian.
6673800	6678800	And my name is Hordegard.
6678800	6683800	So like there's humans and dwarves and elves.
6683800	6686800	And then there's orcs and there's trolls.
6686800	6695800	And any one of those can be from Norway.
6695800	6697800	The second one.
6697800	6699800	There's dwarves?
6699800	6701800	I'm a dwarf, yes.
6701800	6703800	A Norwegian dwarf.
6703800	6707800	I once had a dwarf.
6707800	6708800	He's an elf.
6708800	6709800	A dwarfling.
6709800	6712800	What about Dan and Erin?
6713800	6716800	I want to be from British Columbia.
6716800	6719800	Okay.
6719800	6731800	And I want my name to be Mercy O'Donnell.
6731800	6740800	And I want my race to be I think human.
6740800	6741800	Okay.
6741800	6743800	Mercy O'Donnell, the human from British Columbia,
6743800	6747800	with a face that you've never seen.
6747800	6749800	It looks like a picture of the galaxy.
6749800	6751800	And you're like, how did they take that picture?
6751800	6752800	But it's a human.
6752800	6754800	It doesn't actually look like the galaxy,
6754800	6759800	but your relationship with it is like you're looking at the heavens.
6759800	6764800	I am very excited.
6764800	6767800	I'd like to be human.
6767800	6769800	All right.
6769800	6771800	I'm going to be a 15-year-old girl named Juna,
6771800	6773800	who's an elf sorcerer.
6773800	6774800	All right.
6774800	6777800	I think we got everything settled then.
6777800	6778800	Yeah.
6778800	6779800	Yeah.
6779800	6780800	All right, that's good.
6780800	6782800	So do we have a show next week?
6782800	6788800	My character wears Converse.
6788800	6790800	Is there a show next week?
6790800	6793800	Yeah, there is a show next week.
6793800	6795800	Oh, my God.
6795800	6796800	No.
6796800	6798800	I guess there's not a show on TV.
6798800	6800800	We're getting a rocky start coming back from the New Year.
6800800	6802800	So there's no show next week.
6802800	6806800	But then there's one the week after that.
6806800	6809800	How about that?
6809800	6813800	So what do we have to do between now and the next show, Spencer,
6813800	6814800	in terms of character?
6814800	6816800	Do we have to roll stats and stuff like that?
6816800	6817800	No, I'll take care of all that.
6817800	6819800	Just think about the characters you want to create
6819800	6823800	and their backgrounds and what their interests might be,
6823800	6824800	stuff like that.
6824800	6826800	Now, you're like a super magic guy,
6826800	6829800	so you probably don't want a lot of robot parts.
6829800	6830800	Girl.
6830800	6831800	Yeah, girl.
6831800	6835800	But the rest of you guys think about maybe also what kind
6835800	6837800	of robot parts you want.
6837800	6839800	Do we have to have robot parts?
6839800	6840800	A metal spleen.
6840800	6842800	No, no, you don't have to.
6842800	6843800	What is that based on?
6843800	6844800	How are we making that decision?
6844800	6845800	Why would we want a metal spleen?
6845800	6847800	Because it's the future, man.
6847800	6849800	You can have laser eyes and shit.
6849800	6850800	I don't know.
6850800	6851800	That's part of it.
6851800	6855800	If you want to have a robot arm that has a laser eye in it,
6855800	6858800	do you want like an eye that shoots lasers?
6858800	6860800	Like a drinking fountain in your thumb?
6860800	6863800	I can't be robotic because I'm a magic user?
6863800	6865800	Yeah, it fucks up your magics.
6865800	6866800	Ah, good.
6866800	6868800	Yeah.
6868800	6869800	I love this.
6869800	6873800	So think about those things, and I'll work on making the characters.
6873800	6880800	You know, backgrounds, your histories, what you do on Thursday evenings,
6880800	6881800	stuff like that.
6881800	6883800	I eat lingonberries.
6884800	6887800	What does Jim Nightblade do on a Thursday evening?
6888800	6898800	He just looks out at the futuristic cityscape and wonders how it got to this.
6904800	6907800	Over a vial of blue liquid.
6907800	6912800	Are we returning in two weeks with a presentation or poetry about our characters?
6912800	6914800	You have to write a theme song.
6914800	6916800	That's not up to me.
6916800	6917800	That would be great.
6917800	6921800	We should do old school mazes and monsters.
6921800	6924800	You have to introduce your character.
6924800	6928800	I am Cariana of the...
6928800	6929800	Yeah, I don't know.
6929800	6930800	We'll figure it out.
6930800	6932800	Two minute presentation.
6932800	6935800	Any medium we would like.
6935800	6937800	Except PowerPoint.
6937800	6938800	Except PowerPoint.
6938800	6940800	I also feel like structurally...
6941800	6943800	I hate PowerPoint.
6943800	6944800	We?
6948800	6950800	Is the gameplay the same as D&D?
6950800	6953800	I mean, for you guys it probably will be.
6953800	6956800	Yeah, it'll be pretty familiar.
6956800	6962800	I would like, on our side, I will take the step toward improving things by...
6962800	6968800	I think what we'll try to do is move the gameplay session into the middle of the show
6968800	6971800	so that we're not always rip-roaring drunk
6971800	6974800	and it's not the thing that we save for the end.
6974800	6980800	It's like a thing we do at the goddess point of the story and not the end.
6980800	6981800	So that we can...
6981800	6982800	Yeah, I don't know.
6982800	6983800	It's just a thought.
6983800	6988800	That way it'll have a little more consistency.
6988800	6991800	I'm always so fucking drunk by the time we play D&D.
6991800	6993800	I never remember anything.
6993800	6997800	Dan, would it be okay if we did...
6997800	7001800	And when I say we, I mean me, would it be okay if we...
7001800	7003800	Because I don't want to speak for everybody,
7003800	7009800	but if we did maybe have a presentation in two weeks of our characters,
7009800	7010800	would that be okay?
7010800	7011800	Yeah, that's fine.
7011800	7015800	And also it's a visual medium now, so any incentive to...
7015800	7021800	Yeah, if you have a hat or something that you put on and you play the character,
7021800	7024800	then that's all the more reason to...
7024800	7028800	I see Jane is here, earth shine.
7028800	7032800	I'm glad I didn't work there.
7032800	7036800	I've been drinking the Absinthe and I'm high as a Georgia pine over here.
7036800	7037800	Pine 11?
7037800	7039800	The shit is fucking wild.
7039800	7046800	I have to write a song for Community Tomorrow, so I shouldn't be doing it.
7047800	7055800	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
7055800	7058800	You said that you were going to say like,
7058800	7060800	well, I'm supposed to mow the lawn tomorrow,
7060800	7064800	but it's something everybody cares about and is excited about.
7064800	7068800	I have to feed the baby tomorrow.
7068800	7071800	What's the song about without spoiling anything?
7072800	7084800	It's just a song that Britta used to listen to in high school,
7084800	7090800	like a cool alternative song.
7090800	7092800	Like a la who?
7092800	7096800	Maybe Porta's Head, but...
7097800	7100800	Why don't you just try riffing a little bit for us right now?
7100800	7104800	Workshop it. Workshop that shit.
7105800	7107800	I mean, do you have like...
7107800	7108800	I don't have any Porta's Head.
7108800	7110800	I was trying to do the Porta's Head.
7114800	7116800	You want music?
7116800	7118800	Yeah, what do you have?
7118800	7121800	I'll see here. Let's do...
7121800	7123800	Hang on a second.
7124800	7127800	I'll give you something instrumental.
7127800	7130800	What kind of mood do you feel like?
7130800	7134800	I mean, like, like, like, heroin.
7135800	7137800	Like, that's the idea.
7137800	7140800	Kind of like very, very laconic.
7143800	7145800	Not mainstream.
7153800	7155800	Give it a minute.
7159800	7162800	Glass...
7163800	7165800	Blood...
7167800	7170800	Glass, blood, dirt...
7174800	7180800	Needles, dreams...
7181800	7185800	Bloody glass, dream, dirt...
7186800	7189800	Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.
7192800	7195800	Des Moines Browns, Spencer Crittenden, Aaron McGathey,
7195800	7198800	I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.
7198800	7201800	Thank you, Jane, for the booze.
7205800	7208800	Den, Den, keep singing.
7211800	7216800	Trackmark City...
7226800	7229800	Fire escape...
7230800	7232800	Torn dress...
7233800	7236800	Art degree...
7240800	7247800	Why'd I make you such a mistake?
7249800	7255800	Down the drain like a hurricane...
7256800	7263800	Fingernails bleeding on the brain cellophane...
7264800	7269800	Independent label...
7270800	7274800	Toy...
7274800	7277800	Tank top...
7282800	7285800	Good night, everybody. We love you.
7287800	7289800	Did you get any of that?
7289800	7292800	It's a good show!
7292800	7295800	Thanks for watching!
