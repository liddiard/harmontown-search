0	21320	Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California!
21320	23560	Harman Town is now in session.
23560	40520	Please welcome to the stage, the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman!
40520	41520	Thank you.
41520	47520	Thank you for coming out, you're all wonderful, let's figure everything out.
47520	50600	How are you Dan, I'm good, I'm good.
50600	55520	I just came from doing the treatment with Elvis Mitchell, Californians will know what
55520	65280	I'm talking about, KCRW, Elvis Mitchell, very, very wily and unexpectedly deep researcher
65280	67800	in terms of his interviews.
67800	71000	I don't know, I can't figure that guy out, like he was asking me questions about like
71000	77800	comic books I wrote in the 90s, I don't know if he just, is he, I couldn't, it was weird.
78800	80440	Weird how, like he'd done so much research?
80440	86960	Well it was very insightful and asking strange questions that had never been asked and drawing.
86960	92760	I had heard him interview people before, I was fantasized about being a guest of his,
92760	98600	you know, kind of like one day maybe I'll be a writer and I'll be interviewed by this
98600	101520	guy who interviews writers.
101520	109280	And somebody had told me, yeah he draws weird parallels and connects weird dots that may
109280	115320	or may not be there but you, and then he did, he was talking about how all of my work was
115320	121720	about sensitivity, exposed nerves, that's what he kept saying.
121720	127960	I kept saying it's about humanity versus systems, that's what I always thought, but he kept
127960	136680	saying exposed nerves, which I guess, yeah, I don't know, is that just, I feel like you
136680	137680	have exposed nerves.
137680	140120	Yeah, well everyone does, what does that even mean?
140120	141120	I don't know.
141120	142960	Feels like I just hit one right now.
142960	145960	What is that supposed to mean?
145960	150720	Yeah, it was odd and insightful.
150720	152360	I was on fire, I guess.
152360	154840	Do you think it's a catchphrase of his that he's applied to lots of people?
154840	155840	No, god no, absolutely not.
155840	156840	Absolutely not.
156840	161960	No, I don't think, he doesn't have catchphrases that he doesn't have catchalls that he uses
161960	164080	with each individual guest.
164080	169040	It's just that with each guest, the gimmick seems to be that he kind of all of a sudden
169040	174920	is asking a question that's sort of like, oh yeah, I guess, I guess so, I guess.
174920	177040	I don't know how to explain it.
177040	178040	Listen to it.
178040	179040	I'm plugging it.
179040	180040	I was happy with the interview.
180040	186560	But the other weird thing is it was at the house of the guy who created Spongebob Squarepants.
186560	188720	But he wasn't on the show.
188720	189720	It was just at his house.
189720	190720	Is it always at his house?
190720	191720	No, it's not.
191720	193760	Is he always hosed from a different guy?
193760	197200	No, he's not always hosed from a house.
197200	202160	It was pulled up at a giant house, the kind of house you'd expect to have if you created
202160	204080	Spongebob Squarepants.
204080	205400	A giant pineapple.
205400	207600	Rolled in.
207600	215040	And there were all these people, I guess they're KCRW donors, kind of well-heeled liberal
215040	225760	types, kind of ersatz Tim Robbins' and eating prosciutto and things, and drinking delightful
225760	227680	Campari drinks.
227680	228880	They were low-budged Tim Robbins?
228880	230880	Well, I wouldn't call them low-budged.
230880	231880	I mean ersatz.
231880	237200	For all we know, well, all right, well, I'm saying non-Tim Robbins' Tim Robbins' handsome
237200	240240	old men with gray feathered hair.
240240	243040	But just not, they weren't in the Hudsucker proxy.
243040	244040	Yeah, exactly.
244040	245040	Well, they weren't actors.
245040	247080	I'm sure a lot of them were captains of industry or something.
247080	250920	They were all patrons of public- All hanging out at the crater of Spongebob's
250920	251920	house?
251920	256200	All at Spongebob's house, even though Spongebob, who I talked to, I don't think he likes to
256200	260120	be called Spongebob.
260120	266440	He was just like, yeah, it's at my house, man, good to have you here.
266440	267440	He was there?
267440	273920	Yeah, but only because his wife was like, I think she's into, I think from talking
273920	282920	to him, what I gleaned is his wife is very active in that community and so offered up
282920	285640	their home as a venue.
285640	290040	The highfalutin liberal writer type of community or what community?
290040	291040	Well, I don't know.
291040	294360	These people were, I believe they were primarily donors.
294360	297000	They were like people who really keep KCRW going.
297000	298000	Oh, I see.
298000	299000	I got you.
299000	300000	Yeah.
300760	307360	Just the strangest, I said to Elvis Mitchell when I got there, well, I've listened to your
307360	308520	show a bunch of times.
308520	309520	I've heard you interview people.
309520	313840	I've never, I didn't know that when I was listening to it, you were in a living room
313840	318400	full of middle-aged- Or sought to Tim Roberts.
318400	319400	Timsters.
319400	321520	I never picked up on that.
321520	323200	He said, no, no, we've never done this before.
323200	328960	I was like, okay, all right, I'll see you on the ice.
328960	338760	We just sat in front of a fireplace surrounded by delightful, primarily caucasoid, like people
338760	344880	kind of just sitting in thrall at every little word I had to say about how I was angry at
344880	347840	executives and how humanity should fight the system.
347840	348840	It was invigorating.
348840	351680	Did you ever get like a back rub from anybody?
351680	357840	There was a point where Elvis started like rubbing me, but it was radio, so you won't
357840	360160	be able to tell from listening.
360160	369480	I didn't feel like I was allowed to say no, which is fucked up, but I also don't feel
369480	371200	like I'm allowed to say that.
371200	378000	But also, you have a lot of exposed nerves, what do you mean?
378000	384720	But it was nice, it was interesting, and I felt very articulate.
384720	388640	I went up and I stumbled over my words very little.
388640	393040	I don't know if it was, I felt like I was in a room full of my parents or something,
393040	397360	and I had to rise to the level of my cardigan.
397360	403600	I'm not saying this to be a glib, had you drunk less?
403600	404600	Did you show up a little more?
404600	409960	No, I had like three of these wonderful drinks they made that were Campari grapefruit drinks.
409960	414440	I don't know if I was less drunk than I usually am.
415440	417600	I'm asking, was it a gig?
417600	420840	You go like, you know, I'm going to have a bunch of water before this.
420840	424000	If anything, I was a little panicked about how sober I was, because I was like, I don't
424000	428680	want my brain to get in the way of what's going on here, I've got a lot of weird class
428680	429680	issues and stuff.
429680	433080	This is a living room full of rich people listening to me.
433080	435080	Did you make any friends outside of Elvis?
435080	438320	I don't make friends, I don't know what that means.
438320	439320	You mean like a snowman?
439320	440320	Like you go in the front yard?
440320	443320	How do you make a friend?
444200	449240	You and these white people on the couch with the gray hair and the back rubs, was there
449240	451240	an after party?
451240	452240	There was a mingling.
452240	455800	In my mind, the sun goes down and you guys are in the tub.
455800	457400	It gets back an alien.
457400	461000	Hey guys, there's a room full of swim trunks, we got all sizes, whatever you want.
461000	467040	No, but I was really taken and a little put off by how handsome everyone was.
467040	473000	I feel like, because they're all over 50 and they all look under 30, and I'm 41 and I
473000	478920	look 60, and I felt like that was okay, but the guy that created SpongeBob's got a 15
478920	484520	year old kid and I won't drop his age, he told me how old he was, and I was shocked.
484520	488760	You know, it's weird when somebody tells you how old they are and my response was like,
488760	490080	holy shit.
490080	497160	But I forgot to say, I'm saying that because you look young, I'm 52 and you go, wow, fuck,
497160	498920	Jesus Christ.
498920	502960	Holy smoke, what's that like?
502960	510800	I mean, people that are, I don't know, they must eat algae and not drink and just walk
510800	516080	in a treadmill and do crunches, fight crime, I don't know what they do, their faces look
516080	517080	like little Ken dolls.
517080	522320	We've opened up parties full of rich white people, they tend to, like people with lots
522320	525880	of money tend to age well, they get really good healthcare and shit.
525880	530880	Yeah, so the guy that created SpongeBob, they get some vitamin D and stuff like that.
530960	534960	Yeah, they know how to, and I wonder, does that mean they're gonna live to 150 or does
534960	539040	that mean, as Aaron said, no, they're gonna die when you die but they're gonna do so gracefully.
539040	542440	They'll probably die 20 years later too, by the way.
542440	545640	But I mean, they'll have a better quality of life.
545640	551400	He looks like Davy Jones, the guy that created SpongeBob, he is like, the number of his age
551400	557040	is like, wow, you should have thrown the towel biologically.
557040	561680	It's a couple years older than me but it's like, I associate it with like, fuck it,
561680	566000	you should be wearing Kleenex boxes on your feet and you should be flipping off traffic
566000	571480	and shooting your TV with a .38 and fucking checking out, man, and he looks like Davy
571480	572480	Jones.
572480	573880	But he created that show a long time ago.
573880	575200	Yeah, and he looks great.
575200	576960	Yeah, okay, I see what you're saying.
576960	581600	It's amazing to me, I get a little jealous, I guess, I should eat some kale or something.
581600	588280	I feel like the secret for the wealthy people that I know that have awesome lives, they
588280	591000	spend a lot of their time on vacation.
591000	596080	There's lots of Riviera's and things, you know, you're on a boat a lot.
596080	603520	Here's somebody who's, to me, this is a truly remarkable, I wish there was a way we could,
603520	607720	somebody Wikipedia Stan Winston and tell me how old he is.
607720	609760	Is that the special effects guy?
609760	610760	Yeah.
610880	615320	We're watching the newest season of King of the Nerds, remember when we had Genevieve
615320	619320	Pearson on the show, she was a contestant on King of the Nerds, there's a new season
619320	620320	of that.
620320	626760	Stan Winston comes out with a robot he built or whatever, he looks like Tony Hawk or something.
626760	630800	I have been to his old house many times because Ryan Styles from Whose Line bought his old
630800	635160	house in LA, I think he recently sold, and his house is up in like, his old house he
635160	636920	got rid of.
636920	639120	You'd be young if you had this house.
639120	643720	In something like the valley side of the Hollywood Hills, like towards Encino, there's
643720	648240	a backyard that if you were the guy in the world that could throw a football the farthest,
648240	650920	you couldn't throw a football out of that yard.
650920	655920	And there was a, it was like, the front of it looked like if Bilbo Baggins was as tall
655920	663120	as Gandalf, it looked like a Shire home, except the person that lived there was 11 feet tall.
663120	669440	We have shared units of measure like acres and yards, if you, you don't have to, nobody
669440	677000	knows, no, see, fuck you, because, oh no, if I said, Dan, it was 14,000 square feet,
677000	680120	you would go, ooh la la, you wouldn't know what I was talking about, you would say, how
680120	682120	many, you would say, how many hobbits?
682120	687200	How many Gandalfs, if I was a Gandalf, how many hobbits, okay, how dare you, you hit
687200	691080	my exposed nerve, you son of a bitch, I really do.
691080	694720	There's a house there from the front, you go, that looks like a nice, beautiful, like,
694720	699440	Bilbo Baggins-y Gandalf house, and you get inside, you can get lost in the cocksucker,
699440	703200	you can actually hang a wrong turn, and then you go, okay, I don't remember how to get
703200	704680	back to the wine cellar.
704680	709520	I know that there was a pool table, but you can't, and fucking, like, I think, it's not
709520	711920	all, it's not, the old comic.
711920	716520	Does everybody, if you go to Pottery Barn, if you're lucky enough to get it before they
716520	723680	sell out of the five that they keep on the counter, Jeff's album of covers of classics,
723680	727780	it's called Lost in the Cocksucker.
727780	732440	It's so beautiful, like, you do, you're not, it's not original stuff, but you really bring
732440	738560	new life into, it's all, it's all by a paper moon, so I do Sound of Silence, it's good
738560	742320	stuff, it's mostly zither.
743320	748080	The comic Joe E. Lewis from the 20s, 30s, he said, money isn't everything, but it calms
748080	752680	the nerves a little, and I think that there's a thing about wealth, if you're not, wealth
752680	758160	can also destroy you, wealth can turn you into a Scrooge, and it can crush and weaken
758160	763160	yourselves, I think, if all you care about is competition, but there are people, and
763160	769880	I think in our world, this little enclave that we live in, I don't meet rich tycoons,
769920	774880	I don't meet entrepreneurs and shit, I meet rich comedians and singers and stuff like
774880	780120	that, and I think it may be the art that keeps them young, but I think there's a way to grow
780120	785760	old gracefully, and certainly money doesn't hurt.
785760	795480	Speaking of, no, fuck that, okay, all right, so here's a new segment called What Am I Doing,
795480	800160	what's Dan Harmon doing, it's the most boring segment we've ever done, let's get it out
800160	804200	of the way, do you have a boring song, a boring song, that song I almost started the show
804200	805200	with?
805200	819720	What's Dan Harmon doing this week on his schedule?
819720	827840	So tomorrow morning I'm going in, you guys may have seen me on Twitter or the whatnot
827840	833040	making fun of the fact that there's this Dungeons and Dragons anthology on tape coming out,
833040	834040	on tape, on-
834040	837720	It's on ceramic disc, I think it's on-
837720	846520	On audible bit-bytes, Ice-T did this Dungeons and Dragons thing, and he was interviewed
846520	850960	about it, I guess he was saying things like, yes, weirdest thing I ever read, I couldn't-
850960	857440	It's a bunch of gobbledygook, and I've been doing my impression of Ice-T-
857440	858440	No, I'm just saying-
858440	867160	First thing not, the orc came down the mountain wielding his axe plus three, it wasn't personal,
867160	868160	it was business.
868160	871400	Wait, can I hit pause real quick?
871400	876240	Sure, because I currently have 14 questions.
876240	880040	Question number one, he is a dungeon master, he's narrating, he's reading it out loud-
880040	891920	He's reading an audible book, it's a D&D book, thanks, a lot.
891920	898640	What a lighthouse.
898640	902120	In my stammering, the only words I had were D&D book.
902120	904560	Like a player's guide or a monster manual?
904560	907880	Well, Adam, you think you know- It's a- there's a-
907880	908880	Adam?
908880	909880	Okay, Adam.
909880	910880	I mean, we-
910880	911880	Alright.
911880	912880	Yeah.
912880	913880	Yeah, everyone's excited.
913880	915280	They're not saying boo, they're saying Adam.
915280	917280	I was saying boo.
917280	924040	No, he's doing a D&D novel, and he talked on his podcast, which he now has, about how
924040	927360	motherfuckers have maps for places that don't even exist.
927360	928360	It's ridiculous.
928360	931040	I read this to my D- I-
931040	932040	Did somebody put him up-
932040	935520	This is my D&D group, and we named our group Places That Don't Motherfuckin' Exist.
935520	937920	Did someone put him up to this, or something genius producers say?
937920	938920	He has a bad agent.
938920	939920	Or a really bad agent.
939920	942880	Well, I don't know, because it's not like he wants for money, although in other interviews
942880	947680	he's said that he basically- he's driven- Joel McHale is like this, like, sometimes
947680	951400	no matter how much money you have, you might be driven by a compo- like a work ethic.
951400	954160	Maybe Ice-T has this- maybe he's Irish, I don't know.
954160	957080	He wanted to get a book out, so everybody would know that his voice should not just
957080	958600	be on comedy bang bang.
958600	959600	Alright.
959840	965280	So anyways, I tweeted about it, I was so taken with the idea of Ice-T, then a day- doing
965280	970760	a Dungeons and Dragons book on tape, the next day I get an email inviting me to be one of
970760	971760	the people, because it's like an anthology-
971760	973360	On Ice-T's D&D thing?
973360	978240	Well, it's not Ice- I will be a label mate with Ice-T, you would say.
978240	980240	What the fuck?
980240	983920	So they ask, will you come in and do this thing, and I'm doing it tomorrow morning,
983920	987280	here are my other label mates, here are the other people that are doing- that are reading
987280	988560	the thing.
988560	993840	Michael Chiklis, now I'm going to breeze through some names that maybe you know.
993840	1003000	Felicia Day, Melissa Rasch, Tom Felton, Greg Grunberg, Weird Al Yankovic-
1003000	1004000	Yeah.
1004000	1005000	Yeah.
1005000	1007000	It makes sense.
1007000	1008000	Ice-T-
1008000	1010000	Wait, wait, wait, which Al Yankovic?
1010000	1013400	Deposed, Ukrainian-
1013400	1019640	Not that uptight cocksucker, Alan, fuck him.
1019640	1034840	The Ice-T, Will Wheaton, here's where my kneecaps go all buttery, David Dukovny, David Dukovny.
1034840	1039920	If you've listened to all 89 episodes of this podcast, you know that instinctively when
1039920	1043520	I talk about a sexy man, I blurt out David Dukovny.
1043520	1051840	Wait, okay, Dan, maybe I'm behind the ball here, but like, there is a- he started doing
1051840	1052840	this?
1052840	1053840	There's Ice-T's project?
1053840	1054840	Or somebody wants a project?
1054840	1055840	No, it's not Ice-T's project.
1055840	1056840	They got them to read the books.
1056840	1057840	They didn't write the books.
1057840	1059480	They brought him in and now they're bringing me in.
1059480	1060480	Who is this they?
1060480	1065520	It's a kind of fellowship of like, you know, as Aaron said, I want to see this pilot with
1065520	1068040	these people being locked in a cabin.
1068040	1073480	I have one more name to tell you, Sean Astin and, oh, and Danny Pooty, they were at the
1073480	1077480	time of this email, they were going to try to get Danny Pooty.
1077480	1078480	David Dukovny.
1078480	1080320	Is it a television project?
1080320	1082320	No, it's audiobooks.
1082320	1086480	It's reading a thing on, it's a book on tape.
1086480	1088200	You said pilot.
1088200	1089200	I didn't say pilot.
1089200	1090200	Oh, I heard pilot.
1090200	1091200	I'm sorry.
1091200	1094880	Ice-T came in chapter one.
1094880	1097680	Grim Knops had had it.
1097680	1100640	Did he write the material?
1100640	1103760	Down to three hit points.
1103760	1107200	Things were not looking good for Tordak the Dwarf.
1107200	1113080	A moderate heel wound spell took care of the last of the concerns.
1113080	1116720	However, business remained.
1116720	1117720	So he'll do that.
1117720	1122160	And then I'm going to come in and be like, no, also, here's another thing.
1122160	1124160	That was a really good Dan Harmon.
1124160	1125160	All right, thank you, Adam Galbrake.
1125160	1126160	Thank you for coming on back.
1126160	1127160	Adam, really?
1127160	1128160	Yeah.
1128160	1132640	I mean, that couldn't have happened from the audience.
1132640	1134640	They call him the elucidator.
1134640	1141160	Dan, I wonder, first off, couple things.
1141160	1143680	Full disclosure, I like your Ice-T impression quite a bit.
1143680	1144680	Thank you.
1144680	1146080	It's a very good Ice-T impression.
1146080	1148040	It's nothing personal, Jeff.
1148040	1151240	It's just business.
1151240	1160440	I would like to hear a brief conversation between Ice-T and Vincent Price, though.
1160440	1165600	Just so I can hear how many Gandalfs of distance are in between.
1165600	1168800	So you're saying Ice-T is coming over to Vincent Price's house.
1168800	1170320	He's been invited over for dinner?
1170320	1171320	Look, certainly.
1171320	1172320	Yeah, yeah.
1172320	1173320	Whatever you want.
1173320	1175960	And he doesn't know that for dinner sometimes means I'm going to eat you?
1176960	1182160	I would say that Elvis Mitchell is going to be doing an interview, but this time it's
1182160	1184080	at Vincent Price's house.
1184080	1188880	You've been asked over and you didn't realize, Ice-T didn't realize that he was coming into
1188880	1189880	Vincent Price's home.
1189880	1190880	Ding dong.
1192880	1193880	Damn.
1199640	1202400	Takes a long time for them to come to the door.
1206960	1207960	Hello.
1209960	1212960	The fuck?
1212960	1216960	I'm here to do the Elvis Mitchell documentary.
1216960	1217960	Yes.
1219960	1222960	I hope you'll enjoy doing...
1223960	1226960	You're trying to not be Ice-T.
1226960	1227960	Yeah.
1227960	1228960	Okay.
1228960	1229960	I'm not saying you're identical.
1229960	1233960	I'm saying that their Olympic rings overlap a tiny bit.
1233960	1236960	Ice-T, I presume.
1236960	1239960	Please come into my house.
1239960	1241960	I'm Vincent Price.
1242960	1246960	All right, but nothing personal.
1246960	1249960	No, it's business.
1250960	1251960	I...
1251960	1253960	You know what we should do?
1253960	1257960	I think at some point Ice-T should start rapping and Vincent Price could do one of his famous
1257960	1259960	thriller-style breakdowns.
1260960	1261960	All right.
1262960	1263960	Yo.
1263960	1264960	Yo.
1264960	1265960	Yo.
1265960	1266960	Ice-T.
1266960	1268960	Ice-T on the...
1268960	1270960	Ice-T gonna get with me.
1270960	1274960	I got the tippy to the two, got the four to the three.
1274960	1277960	Ice-T, you're gonna put sweetener in me.
1277960	1280960	Cop killer on the front to the four three.
1280960	1283960	Aspect ratio, 69.
1283960	1286960	I got the high definition and it's gonna be mine.
1286960	1288960	I go down to Best Buy.
1288960	1289960	I go down every aisle.
1289960	1290960	I go...
1290960	1292960	Look at VCRs by the mile.
1292960	1296960	Say, will this one have a tracking problem?
1296960	1298960	I don't know.
1298960	1302960	I got slob-flem in my mouth when I get a code.
1302960	1309960	I wanna go home and watch the old people roll past my porch.
1309960	1312960	Yo, there's Larry Storch.
1312960	1315960	He's an actor from Hawaii Five-O.
1315960	1319960	I don't need your husbands or wives to go to.
1319960	1321960	Google it and verify my reference.
1321960	1324960	I just wanna rap and experience your deference.
1324960	1327960	Cause I'm OG to the O-G-O.
1327960	1331960	That means original gangster got a old in the go.
1331960	1334960	I don't know what it spells all day,
1334960	1337960	but I'm ice motherfucking T and I'm not gay.
1337960	1340960	Got a cop killer bullet in my penis for a gun.
1340960	1341960	Gonna...
1341960	1343960	Gonna rub it till I start to cum.
1343960	1345960	And when the sperm comes out,
1345960	1347960	gonna pierce the armor of a cop.
1347960	1350960	And then you know I went farther than.
1350960	1351960	I should've gone.
1351960	1354960	Should've left it back.
1354960	1356960	When I rhymed a couple times.
1356960	1359960	Yo, yo, I'm ice T rapping hard
1359960	1364960	and now it's time for me to do the Vincent Price Bridge.
1364960	1370960	Spiders and skeletons coming out of your closet.
1370960	1374960	On a spooky Halloween.
1374960	1377960	The mind reels with scariness.
1377960	1381960	Fogs and fogs of scary souls.
1381960	1385960	Blood in buckets of wolf howls.
1385960	1388960	On a howl's eve.
1388960	1389960	Cop killer.
1389960	1390960	Yo, yeah.
1390960	1391960	Cop killer.
1391960	1392960	Yeah, yeah.
1392960	1396960	I'm sorry.
1396960	1399960	I couldn't tell the difference.
1399960	1403960	If ice T didn't tell you Vincent Price was coming in,
1403960	1405960	that could've been a very confusing album.
1405960	1406960	There's a reason why.
1406960	1408960	When Vincent Price got the Michael Jackson call,
1408960	1413960	he's like, who wants me to do a bridge in their popular song?
1413960	1415960	Is it one of those people I sound like?
1415960	1417960	No, this is Michael Jackson.
1417960	1419960	Let me hear a recording of him.
1419960	1421960	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1421960	1423960	All right, okay, I'll do it.
1423960	1425960	Ice T wants you to do it.
1425960	1426960	Let me hear.
1426960	1428960	Yo, I'm ice T.
1428960	1429960	I won't do it.
1429960	1433960	Okay, that was a long walk for...
1433960	1436960	Sometimes I tell you a joke and then I explain it.
1436960	1438960	Larry Storch was on Hawaii Five-O?
1438960	1440960	I think so.
1440960	1442960	I'm gonna go on F Troop.
1442960	1443960	He's on F Troop.
1443960	1445960	I told you not to look it up.
1445960	1447960	Ice T told you.
1447960	1451960	I would love to find out that Larry Storch was also on Hawaii Five-O.
1451960	1452960	It's nothing personal.
1452960	1454960	It's just business.
1455960	1459960	The Harman Town documentary is gonna be at South by Southwest.
1459960	1461960	I forgot to mention that last week.
1461960	1463960	Go see it.
1463960	1465960	We want to fill that theater.
1465960	1466960	Do we know what's gonna happen with it?
1466960	1472960	Are they waiting for the festival people to decide how that will be released, distributed, shown?
1472960	1476960	Oh, no, yeah, the idea of these festivals is you show it and then...
1476960	1480960	I guess probably Harvey Weinstein will come up afterwards and go,
1481960	1487960	I think America is ready to watch a movie about a fat alcoholic baby.
1487960	1490960	Do nothing.
1490960	1495960	Let's put this in 50,000 theaters.
1495960	1500960	I mean, barring that happening, I think it'll be in the fans' hands.
1500960	1502960	I think it's a very interesting movie.
1502960	1503960	I'll say one thing.
1503960	1507960	It's a very fair portrayal of me, which is a bummer for me.
1507960	1510960	But that was up to you, because this thing has gone through zillions of cuts,
1510960	1514960	but you kept going in there saying, no, let's not pull the punches on that.
1514960	1515960	Well, don't mischaracterize that.
1515960	1517960	A lot of people online are wondering about that,
1517960	1519960	but I want to make it very clear, and it will be made very clear,
1519960	1521960	because my name's on it as executive producer,
1521960	1525960	but I think it'll be very clear when you see it that I couldn't possibly have had final cuts.
1525960	1527960	And I don't.
1527960	1532960	The deal I made with Neil was for the feels and the wheel.
1532960	1534960	You dig?
1534960	1538960	The deal I made with Neil was, it's my tour, it's his movie.
1538960	1541960	And I wanted to be able to try to help him,
1541960	1544960	and there were a couple moments where he's doing a bit.
1544960	1548960	If you're saying, hey, look at that thing across the room,
1548960	1553960	and I'm able to say, you should cut to that thing here,
1553960	1556960	and it'll get a bigger laugh than what you're getting right now
1556960	1558960	if you change it by eight frames.
1558960	1559960	But I am not allowed.
1559960	1562960	I wish I was allowed, which is why I can't be allowed,
1562960	1565960	to say, hey, you know that part where I'm really abusive to my girlfriend?
1565960	1567960	Let's lift that.
1567960	1570960	It would make a shittier movie,
1570960	1575960	and also, yeah, I would be doing it for the wrong reasons.
1575960	1578960	I think it's an interesting documentary.
1578960	1579960	I can't tell.
1579960	1582960	I'm required to hate myself, required to be bored by myself.
1582960	1583960	I watch the movie.
1583960	1585960	I go, I'm always kind of riveted.
1585960	1586960	I've talked to people who have seen it.
1586960	1588960	They go, I want to see the whole thing.
1588960	1590960	I saw kind of it with Kate, and I watched it,
1590960	1591960	and he's like, do you have any notes?
1591960	1592960	I'm like, no.
1592960	1593960	I was in it.
1593960	1596960	My only note is I wish I could see the entire tour.
1596960	1598960	It made me feel nostalgic for me.
1598960	1599960	Which I think people will be able to.
1599960	1601960	I think there's like 700 hours of things,
1601960	1603960	including like 25 minutes of John Oliver.
1603960	1606960	That would be worth $5 right there.
1606960	1609960	I mean, this guy shot a lot of shit.
1609960	1612960	They could show 17 hours of us singing Pringles Dick
1612960	1614960	and Chicken Noodle Dick.
1614960	1619960	I think what emerges is a very, very, very interesting
1619960	1624960	portrait of a 41-year-old idiot
1624960	1627960	that doesn't know what he's doing at all.
1627960	1628960	Okay.
1628960	1634960	But I think it's interesting.
1634960	1638960	There's a depth to it, too, that has to do with the fans.
1638960	1639960	That's my favorite part.
1639960	1641960	I don't think you can spoil that,
1641960	1644960	but the best part about it, there's interviews
1644960	1646960	after lots of the shows with a bunch of people
1646960	1648960	that came to the shows.
1648960	1651960	I've seen several different cuts and clips of that,
1651960	1653960	and it really chokes me up.
1653960	1656960	It's really sweet and emotional.
1656960	1658960	If you're within the sound of my voice,
1658960	1661960	please come to that premiere, whatever theater we're in.
1661960	1663960	I think we're in a huge theater,
1663960	1665960	and I want to fill that thing.
1665960	1667960	Then we're watching the movie,
1667960	1668960	and then we're all going to go out.
1668960	1670960	I think so, yeah.
1670960	1673960	Well, are we sure about that?
1673960	1675960	I don't know for sure about that yet.
1675960	1676960	No, I don't know.
1676960	1678960	I mean, because they were e-mailing me going,
1678960	1680960	oh, the venue might be changing and all this stuff.
1680960	1684960	Anyways, why don't we put the onus on the bonus
1684960	1688960	and bring out Mitch Hurwitz!
1688960	1689960	Yo.
1689960	1690960	Yeah.
1690960	1691960	Yeah.
1691960	1692960	Yeah.
1692960	1693960	Yeah.
1693960	1694960	Yeah.
1694960	1695960	Yeah.
1695960	1696960	Yeah.
1696960	1697960	Oh!
1697960	1698960	Yeah.
1698960	1699960	Oh.
1699960	1701960	Mitch Hurwitz, Arrested Development.
1701960	1704960	Gonna fuck your mama, then give her a breath mint.
1704960	1706960	Gonna fuck your mama, gonna do a Netflix.
1706960	1707960	Oh, that's so nice.
1707960	1709960	Fuck your mama with a hundred of my squid dicks.
1709960	1710960	Oh, this is wonderful.
1710960	1711960	Arrested Development.
1711960	1713960	Fuck you for seasoning.
1713960	1714960	Pay the rent.
1714960	1715960	Oh, thank you.
1715960	1716960	Robin Williams breakdown.
1716960	1717960	Robin Williams breakdown.
1717960	1720960	Robin Williams breakdown.
1720960	1721960	Oh, no.
1721960	1722960	Yeah.
1722960	1723960	Yeah.
1723960	1724960	Yeah.
1724960	1725960	Oh, no.
1725960	1726960	That's all I wanted.
1726960	1727960	That's all I wanted.
1727960	1728960	That's all I wanted.
1728960	1730960	Will you remember any of this tomorrow?
1730960	1732960	Will you hear this podcast and say...
1732960	1733960	That's a loaded question.
1733960	1735960	Will you hear the podcast and say,
1735960	1738960	I do not remember singing about VCR tracking.
1738960	1740960	Do you even remember now?
1740960	1741960	I'm sober as a...
1741960	1742960	No, it's not that.
1742960	1743960	Relatively speaking, I'm very sober.
1743960	1746960	It's just that it was such stream of consciousness.
1746960	1747960	That is so impressive.
1747960	1748960	That's why my rapping is important.
1748960	1749960	Oh, my God.
1749960	1750960	Can you not freestyle, Mitch?
1750960	1751960	Have you ever tried and failed?
1751960	1752960	No, I really haven't.
1752960	1754960	I think everybody's tried at one point.
1754960	1755960	I don't know that I want to start tonight.
1755960	1757960	Everybody's tried to handle it at a freestyle.
1757960	1760960	I was telling people today, like Mike Schneider, a TV guy.
1760960	1762960	Do you know that fellow?
1762960	1763960	I like Mike.
1763960	1764960	Yeah.
1764960	1765960	He's all right.
1765960	1766960	He has his moments.
1766960	1769960	It was explaining that you and I were now best friends.
1769960	1770960	I don't want to smother you.
1770960	1771960	Yeah.
1771960	1773960	Only on stage, and we keep it that way.
1773960	1775960	We won't even look at each other.
1775960	1779960	Talking about the intimidating nature of...
1779960	1780960	This is ridiculous.
1780960	1781960	No.
1781960	1782960	It puts you on the spot.
1782960	1784960	You really encapsulate wittiness.
1784960	1785960	It's really ridiculous.
1785960	1786960	Oh, God.
1786960	1787960	Oh, no.
1787960	1790960	You know, it reminds me.
1790960	1792960	No, I have nothing.
1792960	1796960	No, it occurred to me halfway through that it was such a ridiculous thing to say to somebody
1796960	1797960	on stage.
1797960	1798960	Oh, that's very nice.
1798960	1799960	I'm so sorry.
1799960	1800960	I'm so sorry.
1800960	1801960	I was just talking to your fiancé.
1801960	1802960	Fiancee.
1802960	1803960	Right?
1803960	1804960	The two of you.
1804960	1805960	What do you marry her?
1805960	1806960	Noel.
1806960	1807960	Listen.
1807960	1808960	I mean, I think if we're going there already.
1808960	1811960	But anyway, I was just making out with...
1811960	1814960	I was just talking to your...
1814960	1817960	And she said you were so articulate today.
1817960	1819960	Any other shoes dropping here?
1819960	1820960	Yeah.
1820960	1823960	I feel more comfortable with 45-year-old people with gray in their hair.
1823960	1824960	No kidding.
1824960	1831960	I wasn't thrilled backstage listening to kind of what sounded maybe like dissing white people
1831960	1832960	that have some money.
1832960	1834960	I felt like that was maybe older people.
1834960	1836960	I kind of felt like...
1836960	1837960	I think it's okay to pull that thread, though.
1837960	1838960	That could hurt somebody's feelings.
1838960	1839960	No, no.
1841960	1842960	It really hurts.
1842960	1844960	There's no danger there of anything happening, though.
1844960	1845960	You're going to have a target.
1845960	1847960	Was Elvis Mitchell being very thoughtful with you?
1847960	1848960	What's he like in front of an audience?
1848960	1849960	He was deep.
1849960	1850960	Has he ever interviewed you?
1850960	1855960	No, but I listened to his interviews, and he'll be talking about the movie Easy A.
1855960	1857960	How has he never interviewed you?
1857960	1858960	Yeah, fired up.
1858960	1859960	What?
1859960	1860960	You've never...
1860960	1861960	I'm surprised by that.
1861960	1862960	No.
1862960	1863960	No.
1863960	1864960	Mitch, do you feel...
1864960	1865960	Why?
1865960	1866960	Because my name's Mitchell?
1866960	1867960	Is that why you just thought that would be like...
1867960	1868960	Yeah, because you created...
1868960	1870960	We could do 10 minutes on the name.
1871960	1872960	You know, I don't...
1872960	1873960	No.
1873960	1874960	I talked to Terry Gross once.
1874960	1875960	What?
1875960	1876960	Yeah.
1876960	1877960	Fuck you.
1877960	1878960	Did he talk to Terry Gross?
1878960	1879960	No.
1879960	1880960	And right in the middle of it, she said,
1880960	1881960	This is fresh air.
1881960	1883960	And it really was like...
1883960	1884960	You know.
1884960	1887960	It's like Hendrix playing the national anthem or something.
1887960	1888960	It's like...
1888960	1889960	There it is!
1889960	1890960	No, that's...
1890960	1891960	Okay, that's the answer.
1891960	1895960	The reason why Elvis Mitchell's never sat down with you is because he's local.
1895960	1896960	You're a big league.
1896960	1897960	And he got the Terry Gross.
1897960	1898960	He's black, right?
1898960	1899960	Is he black?
1899960	1900960	I didn't notice.
1900960	1901960	I don't see that kind of thing.
1901960	1902960	Okay.
1902960	1903960	I guess come to think of it, I suppose...
1903960	1904960	Yeah.
1904960	1905960	Well, I have a problem...
1905960	1907960	You know, I have that problem with black people.
1907960	1908960	Right, no.
1908960	1909960	So that could have been part of it.
1909960	1910960	Wait, Elvis Mitchell's black?
1910960	1911960	Yes.
1911960	1912960	I think he is.
1912960	1914960	But Dan would know.
1914960	1916960	You really should know.
1916960	1918960	Now that you mention it, yes, he was.
1918960	1919960	I just...
1919960	1922960	I admire your restraint in not bringing that up earlier.
1922960	1926960	That's the first time you've ever had an encounter with a black person before that.
1926960	1928960	You didn't say the word black in the first sentence.
1928960	1931960	I mean, I don't think we can forget, you know, the impression of iced tea.
1931960	1932960	I don't think we should go...
1932960	1933960	You know what I mean?
1933960	1935960	I don't think we should just let that go completely.
1935960	1938960	That is an accurate impression of iced tea.
1938960	1939960	I'm very accurate.
1939960	1946960	And any stereotypical landmines that I'm stepping on are attached to his feet.
1946960	1947960	Absolutely.
1947960	1949960	He sounds like that.
1949960	1950960	It's not personal.
1950960	1951960	You're channeling something.
1951960	1954960	It's just business.
1954960	1960960	I love how it ends with I eat.
1960960	1965960	You're telling me this lady was raped, then murdered?
1965960	1968960	It's SBU.
1968960	1972960	It's him on the crime scene.
1972960	1974960	It's a nasty city.
1974960	1976960	What's he been up to, Mitch?
1976960	1979960	Him and his stand-up comic friend, Richard Belzer.
1979960	1981960	What have I been up to?
1982960	1985960	God, I'm being held accountable for so many things.
1985960	1986960	I'll tell you what.
1986960	1989960	I watched House of Cards.
1989960	1991960	That really...
1991960	1992960	That was fun.
1992960	1993960	Are you...
1993960	1994960	Well, okay.
1994960	1995960	Let's talk about that.
1995960	1996960	Well, I don't know.
1996960	1997960	I can't say anything about it because I'm friendly.
1997960	1998960	I watched last season.
1998960	2002960	Last season ended with him, like, going jogging and turning off his Walkman or something.
2002960	2005960	You know, I had no recollection of what happened in the last season.
2005960	2006960	Yeah.
2006960	2007960	It was just sort of...
2007960	2008960	Yeah, but it was fun.
2008960	2009960	It was really...
2009960	2010960	It was fun.
2010960	2011960	And it helps...
2011960	2013960	You know, like, it just helps you plan...
2013960	2016960	It's going to sound awful.
2016960	2019960	But anyway, it helps you plan your own murders because you...
2019960	2020960	Right.
2020960	2021960	He gets away with it.
2021960	2023960	Because you see how he plans it.
2023960	2028960	In case you haven't seen it, he kills a couple people and...
2028960	2029960	No, here's what I didn't get.
2029960	2032960	Actually, one of the things I didn't get about it that...
2032960	2035960	But I just don't get in life, and you kind of alluded to this earlier.
2035960	2037960	Like, how much is too much?
2037960	2038960	There's one scene.
2038960	2039960	Have you seen it?
2039960	2040960	The first season.
2040960	2041960	Yeah, right.
2041960	2042960	You're right.
2042960	2044960	There's one scene where Gerald McCraney is talking...
2044960	2045960	You know, they're threatening Gerald McCraney.
2045960	2047960	They say, we're going to shut down your power plants for two weeks.
2047960	2048960	That's going to be a lot of income.
2048960	2050960	And I'm just always amazed by that.
2050960	2054960	I used to talk to Ron Howard about that when we did Arrested the first time.
2054960	2058960	And I said, you know, if I had directed Cocoon, that would have been it.
2058960	2061960	I would have been, like, you know, walking into restaurants and saying,
2061960	2063960	Mitchell Hurwitz, director of Cocoon.
2063960	2068960	I certainly wouldn't be just out there doing another one every year.
2068960	2069960	What do you say?
2069960	2070960	I'm not sure...
2070960	2072960	I don't understand what you're saying.
2072960	2075960	Well, I'm just saying that ruthless ambition...
2075960	2076960	I don't know.
2076960	2078960	Maybe it's just in all of us.
2078960	2081960	Are you asking why these powerful men continue to play power games?
2081960	2082960	Is that what you're saying?
2082960	2083960	Yeah, I guess so.
2083960	2084960	That always confuses the hell out of me.
2084960	2087960	Why is Rupert Murdoch continue to care?
2087960	2088960	Why?
2088960	2089960	Why?
2089960	2092960	Because they're competitive people, and it's all about winning.
2092960	2094960	They're not used to being second in anything.
2095960	2098960	Like, Carnegie and Rockefeller and those guys,
2098960	2101960	they resent that someone has more money than them.
2101960	2103960	And they're not measuring things in terms of...
2103960	2106960	Like, a quarter is not a quarter of a dollar.
2106960	2108960	It doesn't exist to them.
2108960	2110960	I would say it certainly does.
2110960	2112960	I think they know exactly what a quarter is.
2112960	2115960	No, but I mean, it doesn't represent a fourth of a load of laundry.
2115960	2118960	It doesn't translate into goods and services.
2118960	2120960	It's a measure of a video game that's applied.
2120960	2122960	But it represents that bit of mortar and the brick in the house that I built
2122960	2124960	with my own two hands and I pulled myself up.
2124960	2126960	No, I think it's just a collection.
2126960	2128960	I think it's just like collectors.
2128960	2130960	And these guys aren't bootstrappers.
2130960	2132960	I mean, I don't care how many millions they were born with.
2132960	2134960	They were not born poor.
2134960	2135960	Some were.
2135960	2139960	Like, some of the robber barons I think were working class.
2139960	2142960	Well, maybe back before money was just being invented.
2142960	2145960	Maybe a couple of them by sheer coincidence didn't have enough
2145960	2147960	because money hadn't been invented yet.
2147960	2149960	But I don't want to name names.
2150960	2155960	But today's tycoons, I guarantee you, there's none of them that were born broke
2155960	2156960	or we'd know their name.
2156960	2159960	We'd go like, that's the guy that was born broke and is now a tycoon.
2159960	2163960	Some of them are very proud of the fact that they were only given 50 million
2163960	2165960	to start their whatchamacallit.
2165960	2166960	Oh, absolutely.
2166960	2167960	That's Trump's story.
2167960	2170960	You know, he took 50 million and turned it into a billion.
2170960	2173960	First of all, you got to put it somewhere.
2173960	2176960	Yeah, you could put that in a money market account.
2176960	2177960	The same thing happens.
2177960	2179960	Yeah, and then you have a problem because you have more money
2179960	2181960	and you got to put that somewhere.
2181960	2184960	That's why I say I don't like it when we take on people that are white
2184960	2185960	and make money.
2185960	2187960	You know, it's challenging.
2189960	2190960	Thank you.
2190960	2191960	Oh, nice.
2191960	2193960	Like there's someone wealthy.
2193960	2195960	Have you guys ever hung...
2197960	2200960	Mitch, Dan, have the two of you ever hung out one on one?
2200960	2202960	Ever gone out and had a lunch or a thing?
2202960	2203960	How dare you?
2203960	2204960	Yes.
2204960	2205960	Yeah.
2205960	2206960	Yeah.
2206960	2208960	Are you asking about three ways?
2208960	2209960	I'm just saying.
2209960	2211960	Tell them where we hung out, Mitch.
2211960	2213960	I forget the name of the bar, but it was a bar.
2213960	2215960	Spearmint Rhino?
2215960	2216960	Spearmint Rhino.
2216960	2217960	What is it called, Dry Bar?
2217960	2218960	Dry Bar.
2218960	2219960	We went to the Dry Bar together.
2219960	2220960	God damn it.
2220960	2222960	We hung out at the drawing room.
2222960	2224960	You guys have never been to the Dry Bar.
2224960	2226960	You guys have never hung out together.
2226960	2228960	I hung out at the drawing room with Mitch Hurwitz.
2228960	2230960	They just colluded together to come up with a story.
2230960	2232960	He forgot the name of the place.
2232960	2233960	He's been there.
2233960	2234960	He's been in there.
2234960	2236960	We had a wonderful conversation.
2236960	2238960	He and I are best friends.
2238960	2240960	Jeff has some jealousy issues.
2240960	2243960	He probably doesn't even know that I was the comptroller.
2243960	2245960	When you were gone, he comptroller.
2245960	2246960	I listened to it.
2246960	2247960	You were wonderful.
2247960	2248960	Thank you so much.
2248960	2249960	That is so big of you to say.
2249960	2250960	Don't let him high road you.
2250960	2251960	Thank you.
2251960	2252960	And I think you're great.
2252960	2253960	Well, thank you.
2253960	2254960	You've never listened to Mitch.
2254960	2255960	Yeah, it doesn't matter who you are.
2255960	2256960	No, no.
2256960	2257960	It's not a jealousy thing.
2257960	2258960	You said earlier, Dan, that I said,
2258960	2260960	did you make any friends at the Elvis Mitchell thing?
2260960	2261960	That's a friend.
2261960	2262960	Yeah, I know.
2262960	2263960	You make a friend.
2264960	2266960	Are you a friend-maker, Mitch?
2266960	2267960	Are you a gregarious?
2267960	2268960	No, I'm not, actually.
2268960	2271960	I mean, every time you talk about me as being kind of like,
2271960	2273960	you'll say things like, boy, he's kind of, you know,
2273960	2275960	he doesn't look neurotic or whatever you say.
2275960	2277960	It's like, no, I'm so neurotic.
2277960	2280960	And so, you know, if I'm out with people, I embrace that.
2280960	2281960	I'm always happy about it.
2281960	2283960	But it takes a lot to get me out.
2283960	2285960	Even when you talk about going to San Francisco
2285960	2287960	and doing this tour and everything.
2287960	2288960	Do you want to come to my wedding?
2288960	2289960	I'd love to officiate.
2289960	2290960	Are you?
2290960	2291960	Do you need someone?
2291960	2292960	That gives me enough time.
2292960	2293960	That'd be great.
2293960	2294960	I would.
2294960	2295960	I will.
2295960	2298960	You're on the short list now, for sure.
2298960	2300960	I'll be great.
2300960	2302960	Are you already ordained?
2302960	2304960	No, but I have time now.
2304960	2306960	And I won't make it all about me.
2306960	2308960	I mean, you know, that'll be...
2308960	2311960	Some of it, obviously, I have to have an act.
2311960	2316960	But there has to be a little Robin Williams moment
2316960	2317960	in the officiating.
2317960	2318960	Yeah, that's right.
2318960	2320960	Well, I have a lot of props around.
2320960	2321960	And I'll take a plunger.
2321960	2324960	And I'll be, you know, like, oh, I'm a unicorn.
2324960	2326960	That wasn't Robin Williams.
2326960	2328960	So my favorite Robin Williams thing, though,
2328960	2333960	is the impression of the thing that doesn't exist anymore,
2333960	2335960	which is the preacher.
2335960	2336960	Right.
2336960	2338960	Oh, Jesus Christ.
2338960	2339960	Still making fun of the preacher.
2339960	2341960	Like, we're with you.
2341960	2342960	We get it.
2342960	2344960	He's an asshole.
2344960	2347960	What a hypocrite.
2348960	2350960	The...
2350960	2352960	No, but I could marry the hell out of you.
2352960	2355960	I know now, because I've been married for some time.
2355960	2356960	All right, short list.
2356960	2358960	It's like there's three people on the list.
2358960	2361960	I couldn't stop sweating when I got married.
2361960	2362960	It was awful.
2362960	2364960	I was nervous beforehand.
2364960	2365960	And I was in New York.
2365960	2367960	And I thought, well, let me just go for a run.
2367960	2368960	And that'll calm me down.
2368960	2370960	And I went for a run.
2370960	2372960	Really, I went out into Central Park.
2372960	2374960	And I ran around the whole reservoir.
2374960	2376960	You see your tuxedo running in the tux?
2376960	2379960	Yeah, of course, because you wanted to fit and move with you.
2379960	2380960	No, no, no, no.
2380960	2382960	No, I just used a full spandex bodysuit.
2382960	2383960	And I just went out running.
2383960	2384960	Right.
2384960	2385960	Just for speed.
2385960	2389960	This is back when you were a known strangler.
2391960	2392960	Well, I knew a lot of stranglers.
2392960	2393960	I know what you're thinking of.
2393960	2394960	Never convicted.
2394960	2396960	But you were certainly under investigation for many years.
2396960	2398960	I remember I was jogging past those kids wilding.
2398960	2400960	I was like, hi, kids.
2400960	2401960	I just felt like part of the scene.
2401960	2404960	Anyway, I came back and I looked at the clock.
2404960	2406960	And I had like a half hour.
2406960	2407960	And so I panicked.
2407960	2409960	I hadn't even tried on my tux.
2409960	2410960	And I jumped in the shower.
2410960	2411960	And I came out.
2411960	2412960	And I'm still sweating.
2412960	2413960	And then I put on the tux.
2413960	2416960	And I had to walk like six blocks and then get up on a hoopa.
2416960	2418960	Because at that point, I think I still believed in God.
2418960	2422960	And we had this Jewish thing.
2422960	2425960	I'm going to be honest about my get on top of the hoopa.
2425960	2428960	That's like, you're not Gidget.
2428960	2429960	What?
2429960	2431960	You don't get on top of the hoopa.
2431960	2433960	That's why they were laughing.
2434960	2435960	But why it looked so triumphant.
2435960	2436960	No.
2436960	2437960	Did I say on top of it?
2437960	2438960	No.
2438960	2439960	I was right.
2439960	2440960	But I had to get on top of a stage under a hoopa.
2440960	2442960	And then there was a light right here.
2442960	2445960	And the whole time, I was just like trying to very casually wipe away.
2445960	2447960	It was like Albert Brooks.
2447960	2452960	And nothing says confidence about getting married.
2452960	2455960	Like just a total flop sweat.
2455960	2457960	Nothing says confidence about wanting to get married.
2457960	2459960	Like I should go take a run.
2459960	2460960	I know.
2460960	2461960	I know.
2461960	2463960	Literally my last run.
2463960	2465960	Literally running away from the scene.
2465960	2466960	Yeah.
2466960	2469960	Do you get in fights with your wife?
2469960	2470960	Yeah, kind of.
2470960	2471960	I mean, I've learned.
2471960	2478960	I've learned a lot about, this is what you do when, here's the move.
2478960	2479960	Put on some spandex.
2479960	2481960	I just want to make sure Aaron's not back there.
2481960	2482960	Just run.
2482960	2486960	So nobody ever wants to apologize first when you have a fight.
2486960	2489960	Not when your heart is pounding and your arteries are dying.
2489960	2490960	Go for it.
2490960	2491960	You go for it.
2491960	2492960	You go for it.
2492960	2493960	You don't have to mean it.
2493960	2500960	And it makes them feel so much worse than any insult.
2500960	2503960	You know, you know, how could you say that?
2503960	2504960	How could you say that?
2504960	2505960	There's a lot of that, by the way.
2505960	2508960	We have a lot of like complete, you know, I just feel like every time I feel
2508960	2515960	like every time I, you know, but, um, but if you dive in with like, look, I, I,
2515960	2516960	I love you.
2516960	2518960	I don't, I don't want you to be unhappy.
2518960	2519960	So I'll take the blame.
2519960	2521960	No, I'll take the blame.
2521960	2522960	Okay.
2522960	2527960	You know, they can't, many women can't apologize first, but they can't, you
2527960	2528960	know, resist.
2528960	2531960	I feel like I was always so good at what you're describing.
2531960	2537960	And I, I, I feel like, I don't know if this is justification to rationalization,
2537960	2543960	but I, I can't, I can't get out of that pit with Aaron and I have to assume it's
2543960	2545960	because she intimidates me more than anyone I've been with.
2545960	2550960	I, I find, I find like, I can't, I always know that you're, I've always been
2550960	2555960	able to do that, always been able to like find the high road immediately.
2555960	2556960	And I can never do it.
2556960	2560960	I'm get so, I'm so like mad.
2560960	2561960	Actually, I was only half joking.
2561960	2566960	I mean, I, I will say that one of the keys to like my relationship being
2566960	2570960	successful, I think, and by successful, I mean, she lets me sleep with other
2570960	2571960	women.
2572960	2573960	Safe.
2573960	2574960	Yeah.
2574960	2575960	I mean, that's a, that's a big success.
2575960	2580960	That's once, once you, once you overcome that hurdle, that's matrimony becomes
2580960	2581960	gravy.
2581960	2582960	Yeah, no, that's not true.
2583960	2587960	But it really is kind of, it is doing what I just made a joke out of.
2587960	2592960	It's really trying to see that other person because that's really what anybody
2592960	2593960	wants, right?
2593960	2596960	Is to be seen, is to be acknowledged and everything you're doing in a fight is,
2596960	2600960	is sort of not seeing them and kind of claiming you don't see me.
2600960	2604960	So when I, if I can remind myself of that, I actually can sort of think like,
2604960	2608960	I mean, I look at, look at your fiance.
2608960	2609960	I refuse to.
2609960	2610960	I know.
2610960	2611960	That's a problem.
2611960	2614960	And you just go, oh, I love her.
2614960	2617960	I love her even though she doesn't understand.
2617960	2620960	Also, it's like, it also, it's like, it's like, I don't know anything about
2620960	2623960	Pokemon, but I know it has something to do with weapons or something or choices
2623960	2624960	of attacks.
2624960	2628960	I'm doing a, I'm doing a whole audio book on Pokemon next week.
2628960	2630960	With the Harlem Globetrotters.
2630960	2631960	I'm doing it.
2631960	2632960	I'm doing it.
2632960	2633960	Three cards left.
2633960	2634960	Leila Ali and I, that's Muhammad's daughter, are doing.
2634960	2635960	Yeah.
2635960	2638960	She's, for whatever reason, they put us together.
2638960	2640960	I, I, I, I, I've done a show with Leila.
2640960	2641960	You have not really.
2641960	2642960	I swear to God.
2642960	2644960	But on Whose Line Is Anyway, they brought her out as a guest.
2644960	2645960	Oh my God.
2645960	2648960	So Wayne Brady and I had to sing a song to Leila Ali and she was awesome.
2648960	2649960	She was great.
2649960	2650960	Oh, that's amazing.
2650960	2653960	Also, she, you know, talk about being a guest.
2653960	2654960	I'm a guest.
2654960	2655960	I'm a guest.
2655960	2656960	I'm a guest.
2656960	2657960	I'm a guest.
2657960	2658960	I'm a guest.
2659960	2661960	Also, she, you know, talk about being intimidating.
2661960	2664960	Like she's, she's a, she's never lost a fight.
2666960	2668960	I've never lost a fight.
2668960	2669960	Yeah.
2669960	2670960	Have you ever fought Leila Ali?
2670960	2671960	I've never fought anyone.
2671960	2674960	Have you ever thrown a punch in anger at somebody?
2674960	2677960	Have you ever actually like, like thrown a duke at someone?
2677960	2680960	I can't, I think I can tell some of these stories.
2680960	2681960	It was your wife.
2681960	2682960	Yes.
2682960	2683960	It was your wife.
2683960	2684960	Oh my God.
2684960	2687960	In my defense, you know, they were children.
2687960	2688960	No.
2688960	2689960	And they were welding.
2689960	2691960	I've come, I've more recently, I've come close.
2691960	2694960	You know, like I do lose some sanity in those moments.
2694960	2696960	I just feel like I don't care.
2696960	2699960	I just remembered, and now let's bring Aaron out.
2699960	2701960	I punched her in the jaw in my sleep.
2701960	2702960	All right, Aaron, come on.
2702960	2703960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2707960	2709960	Thank God for saying in your sleep at the end of that.
2709960	2710960	Yeah.
2710960	2712960	I thought you were saying I punched her in the jaw last Tuesday.
2712960	2716960	No, I physically assaulted Aaron in bed.
2716960	2717960	Yeah.
2717960	2722960	We just watched Demolition Man, and I fell asleep.
2722960	2727960	And in my dream, I was fighting Sylvester Stallone in a ring,
2727960	2728960	like I was boxing him.
2728960	2729960	And he kept punching me.
2729960	2731960	And I was getting so frustrated.
2731960	2733960	Because your arms aren't moving right, you know.
2733960	2737960	And then I finally like, and I woke up,
2737960	2740960	and something was weird in the bed.
2740960	2745960	Like I had moved, and my fiance is in bed next to me going,
2745960	2748960	ow, I'm massaging her jaw.
2748960	2749960	Wow.
2749960	2752960	And I'm going, I'm slowly, I punched her.
2752960	2753960	I've done it.
2753960	2756960	I mean, I have, and my excuse really was, it's so lame.
2756960	2758960	But I, you know, my wife's like, you punched her.
2758960	2760960	Well, it's when you and I were together.
2760960	2761960	No, no.
2761960	2762960	There's a big apology.
2762960	2764960	He almost never punches.
2764960	2767960	No, but I said, what's the matter with you?
2767960	2768960	You just punched me.
2768960	2770960	I woke up, and I said, well, I was defending you.
2770960	2772960	Which I really thought at the time.
2772960	2774960	Because that was what was happening in the dream.
2775960	2776960	Yeah, it's fine.
2776960	2778960	I mean, Dan, we've talked about this on the show before.
2778960	2783960	Dan really is very, he's so verbose in his sleep
2783960	2784960	in a weird way.
2784960	2787960	And I like a haunting way, because it's not.
2787960	2789960	It's riveting, I imagine.
2789960	2791960	I mean, most people when they speak in their sleep
2791960	2794960	sound kind of drunk or disoriented.
2794960	2797960	But Dan speaks very clearly and very frightening,
2797960	2800960	weird, non-sequiturs.
2800960	2802960	Also non-secular, though.
2803960	2806960	I get down to mythological physicians.
2806960	2807960	There is no God.
2807960	2809960	God walked down from there.
2809960	2811960	I actually think it's the best part of the documentary
2811960	2813960	I saw in an earlier cut.
2813960	2816960	And that's stuff of you asleep.
2816960	2820960	What if you spoke of your sleep, but it was all gospel?
2820960	2822960	Yeah, Dan speaks in his sleep a lot.
2822960	2827960	And we actually, the other night when Dan falls asleep,
2827960	2829960	I'll watch a shitty movie for comfort.
2829960	2831960	And Dan, we've talked about this before.
2831960	2832960	You've watched Demolition Man.
2832960	2834960	Then you'll watch it.
2834960	2836960	Then we'll go lowbrow.
2836960	2837960	Got it.
2837960	2840960	There's Dan's version of a shitty movie.
2840960	2842960	There's my version of a comforting movie,
2842960	2845960	like My Best Friend's Wedding, et cetera, et cetera.
2845960	2847960	And Dan will wake up in the middle of his sleep
2847960	2850960	and say, well, I mean, if you're not in love,
2850960	2852960	I mean, why don't you just fuck everybody at the wedding
2852960	2855960	and just fall back asleep?
2855960	2859960	And I feel all the shame, because it
2859960	2862960	doesn't feel like he's talking in his sleep.
2862960	2865960	This is not a real, like you a couple of nights ago.
2865960	2867960	It's a one-sided thing, because you don't remember any of it.
2867960	2869960	You got up and left the bedroom, because I
2869960	2871960	was about to fall asleep.
2871960	2874960	This is a milestone in our relationship.
2874960	2876960	You left the bedroom to go finish
2876960	2879960	watching a romantic comedy in a different room,
2879960	2883960	because you knew, air quotes, knew
2883960	2885960	that if you continued watching it in bed,
2885960	2888960	I would have notes in my sleep.
2888960	2890960	And I wasn't mad.
2890960	2892960	I kissed you and patted your bottom,
2892960	2894960	and I walked into the other room.
2894960	2896960	You powdered his bottom?
2896960	2899960	I patted his bottom.
2899960	2900960	That's how he likes to be greeted.
2900960	2901960	You know that.
2901960	2904960	My bottom self powders.
2904960	2906960	Gross.
2906960	2907960	No, that's beautiful.
2907960	2908960	Gross?
2908960	2909960	Gross?
2909960	2910960	I think that's beautiful.
2910960	2911960	Thank you.
2911960	2915960	He woke up in his sleep again and had a criticism
2915960	2917960	for the very shitty movie I was watching,
2917960	2920960	which is like telling somebody that Cheetos are bad for you.
2920960	2921960	Yes, I know.
2921960	2922960	I know.
2922960	2923960	But I'm sleeping.
2923960	2924960	Yeah.
2924960	2925960	What?
2925960	2926960	I'm sleeping.
2926960	2927960	I know.
2927960	2928960	But then you wake...
2928960	2931960	But this is why we've evolved as a couple,
2931960	2933960	because you woke up and you...
2933960	2935960	I hate to tell you guys what I was watching.
2935960	2938960	I was watching How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.
2938960	2941960	How to Lose an Audience in 8 Seconds.
2941960	2943960	Dan, wake up.
2943960	2944960	Dan, wake up.
2944960	2946960	You just did it again, Dan.
2946960	2947960	Fuck that movie.
2947960	2948960	Which is a terrible movie.
2948960	2949960	Fuck that movie.
2949960	2951960	And it's like watching it as a woman,
2951960	2952960	like it's really...
2952960	2953960	Yeah, shame on you.
2953960	2954960	Like sexist and crazy.
2954960	2955960	It's so bad about it.
2955960	2957960	But just the way...
2957960	2964960	The truth is that I like Matthew McConaughey's voice as like a song.
2964960	2965960	Then watch True Detective.
2965960	2967960	I do.
2970960	2971960	Wow.
2971960	2973960	It's so interesting.
2977960	2978960	Yo.
2978960	2979960	Yo.
2979960	2980960	Yo.
2980960	2981960	True Detective.
2981960	2982960	Yo.
2982960	2983960	Yo.
2983960	2984960	True Detective on HBO.
2984960	2985960	It's a...
2985960	2987960	It's the only song you got to take out.
2987960	2989960	It's a serialized miniseries.
2989960	2993960	So it's eligible for a different award category.
2998960	3001960	The truth is like I'm so into True Detective.
3001960	3003960	I wanted more McConaughey.
3003960	3004960	And I was watching it.
3004960	3005960	Then watch Dallas Buyers Club.
3006960	3008960	There it comes.
3008960	3009960	There it comes.
3009960	3010960	Yo.
3010960	3011960	Yo.
3011960	3012960	Yo.
3012960	3013960	Yo.
3013960	3015960	If you're a redneck with AIDS,
3015960	3018960	what you gonna do when your society's made?
3018960	3021960	Your mockery of you and your health care?
3021960	3024960	You gonna go ring the bear?
3024960	3027960	New vitamins from Mexico.
3028960	3029960	Hi.
3033960	3034960	Well thanks Dan.
3034960	3036960	I hadn't seen that yet.
3036960	3039960	I watched it because like I have...
3039960	3040960	I've watched...
3040960	3043960	It'd be great if that was the musical event at the Oscars by the way.
3043960	3046960	It's like you know like they just didn't get like at the last minute.
3046960	3050960	Like Dan we heard you do an amazing tribute.
3051960	3053960	We haven't seen your Philomena.
3053960	3055960	I'm sure it's amazing.
3055960	3058960	I know I'm not alone in like the amazing discovery
3058960	3061960	that Matthew McConaughey is a great actor.
3061960	3064960	So it's funny watching him in these really shitty movies.
3065960	3066960	So anyway.
3066960	3067960	So you will...
3067960	3069960	Then watch Surf's Up Pro.
3069960	3071960	Wait what's it called?
3071960	3073960	Surfer.
3075960	3078960	Anyway Dan woke up out of his sleep and criticized the movie.
3078960	3079960	And I was like you know what?
3079960	3083960	I'm gonna go to the other room because I know this is wrong.
3083960	3084960	I feel like I was doing crack and betting.
3084960	3085960	I was like don't do crack and betting.
3085960	3086960	Yes I know.
3086960	3087960	Yes.
3087960	3088960	I'll do it in the other room.
3088960	3089960	So I kissed him goodbye.
3089960	3091960	That movie's a piece of shit.
3092960	3100960	I fell asleep at the point where that movie spent 10 minutes depicting in real time
3100960	3103960	Kate Hudson learning to play a card game.
3103960	3104960	What?
3104960	3105960	Yeah.
3105960	3107960	She spends 10 minutes of that movie.
3107960	3108960	What game?
3108960	3109960	It's called Bullshit.
3109960	3110960	Bullshit.
3110960	3111960	It's really charming.
3111960	3115960	It's kind of like in Good Will Hunting when they just take 8 minutes to just tell you
3115960	3116960	a street joke.
3116960	3117960	It's just a story point.
3117960	3118960	It's not a movie.
3118960	3119960	Oh Mini Driver tell us a joke.
3119960	3121960	Okay I'm gonna tell you this joke.
3121960	3123960	Once upon a time.
3123960	3124960	And there's no...
3124960	3126960	This is a medium that invented the montage.
3126960	3127960	I'll send the message back.
3127960	3128960	I'll send the message back.
3128960	3129960	Move past it.
3129960	3131960	Show a calendar page going like this.
3131960	3136960	Come back and say oh Mini Driver what a great joke.
3136960	3140960	The Lumiere brothers knew to do that.
3140960	3142960	You fucking forgot it now?
3142960	3143960	Now?
3143960	3146960	My life is trickling away.
3146960	3149960	So does two pair?
3149960	3151960	Does that beat a full house?
3151960	3153960	Let's go back to the start.
3153960	3154960	Wow the game of bullshit.
3154960	3157960	You gotta call bullshit when you call bullshit.
3157960	3158960	No.
3158960	3159960	Okay bullshit.
3159960	3161960	You're supposed to be so delighted by the whole thing.
3161960	3162960	I just want to...
3162960	3165960	How many times his voice is like a heart?
3165960	3168960	Oh no his voice is like a guy who's trying not to project.
3168960	3169960	He's just doing that.
3169960	3173960	No that voice reaches me.
3173960	3175960	Alright alright alright.
3175960	3177960	Yeah yeah yeah.
3177960	3184960	If you don't exhale as you talk anybody can sound like Matthew McConaughey.
3184960	3185960	It's nothing.
3185960	3189960	His voice is like a wave covered in icing.
3189960	3192960	It's like a Christian Slater started his career trying to sound like Nicholson.
3192960	3193960	Which is true by the way.
3193960	3197960	Which is true because my friend Jimmy knows his mother.
3197960	3199960	Tonight Christian Slater.
3199960	3200960	Yeah.
3200960	3202960	You named my other voice Crash.
3202960	3204960	Pump up the volume like Christian Slater.
3204960	3205960	Meow meow.
3205960	3207960	You know they're just copies of other guys.
3207960	3210960	Because Matthew McConaughey is doing Paul Newman.
3210960	3211960	Sure.
3211960	3212960	Well I don't know.
3212960	3213960	Really?
3213960	3214960	Yeah.
3214960	3215960	Oh definitely.
3215960	3216960	But still that doesn't...
3216960	3219960	I mean I still appreciate Christian Slater's voice.
3219960	3222960	I think Paul Newman's a million times cooler and sexier than Christian Slater.
3222960	3224960	I mean not now but yeah right.
3224960	3230960	Kurt Russell in Big Trouble in Little China is doing John Wayne.
3230960	3231960	And that's great.
3231960	3234960	Because he just picks one movie to be John Wayne and that's hilarious.
3234960	3236960	Also that movie, that holds up.
3236960	3237960	Yeah.
3237960	3238960	It does hold up.
3238960	3239960	Big Trouble in Little China.
3239960	3242960	May I make a little announcement really quick?
3242960	3243960	Uh oh.
3243960	3244960	Pregger.
3244960	3245960	Impossible.
3245960	3246960	Pregger.
3246960	3247960	Congratulations Anatoly.
3247960	3248960	You did it.
3248960	3255960	It was pointed out to me that I was a little hard on you last week.
3255960	3256960	I'm sorry.
3256960	3257960	I adore you.
3257960	3258960	And you look great.
3258960	3260960	Look at Wes Anderson in the front row.
3260960	3261960	So quick announcement.
3261960	3263960	Your voice is like an open.
3263960	3264960	Well he's...
3264960	3265960	Well I mean I think...
3265960	3266960	Anatoly come on up here.
3266960	3267960	Check out this Anatoly.
3267960	3268960	Every guy I dated in college.
3268960	3269960	Look at this Anatoly.
3269960	3270960	We would listen to Belle and Sebastian.
3270960	3271960	Look at Anatoly.
3271960	3272960	Look at this Anatoly.
3272960	3273960	Look at this Anatoly.
3273960	3274960	Look at this Anatoly.
3274960	3277960	We would listen to Belle and Sebastian.
3277960	3279960	Look at Anatoly.
3279960	3281960	He would tell me he was sensitive.
3281960	3283960	Look at Anatoly.
3283960	3288960	Then he was afraid of love.
3288960	3289960	What the fuck?
3289960	3291960	That was your announcement?
3291960	3292960	No.
3292960	3293960	Oh.
3293960	3297960	The announcement is everybody here.
3297960	3302960	Dan and I are going through our house and purging a bunch of things and...
3303960	3308960	Oh are you going to try to sell those fucking picture frames again?
3308960	3309960	This is crazy.
3309960	3312960	He makes so much money.
3312960	3313960	You don't...
3313960	3317960	Five for ten dollars.
3317960	3319960	We have a bunch of stuff.
3319960	3323960	As does I'm sure Jeff and I haven't talked to you about this yet.
3323960	3324960	I have no stuff.
3324960	3325960	I know.
3325960	3327960	I live like a Quaker.
3327960	3329960	I have one chair and no one's allowed to sit.
3329960	3332960	Dan and I have a lot of furniture.
3332960	3337960	There's a lot of old community stuff and there's a lot of like extra promotional things.
3337960	3340960	And I'm somebody who loves garage sales.
3340960	3342960	I'm also someone who loves 826LA.
3342960	3344960	Are you guys familiar with 826LA?
3344960	3346960	Which supports kids learning how to write.
3346960	3349960	So we're having a Harman Town garage sale.
3349960	3354960	Which will basically be Dan and I taking all of our things and putting them in this room.
3354960	3357960	All the proceeds going to 826LA.
3357960	3361960	It's going to happen on March 23rd from 11 to 6pm.
3361960	3363960	I'm going to be making a bunch of cakes.
3363960	3367960	We'll have a lot of dirty underwear lined up.
3367960	3369960	Not literally dirty underwear.
3369960	3372960	But a lot of clothes and things.
3372960	3374960	Just a ton of stuff.
3374960	3378960	If you love Dan or love Harman Town or just love things, come on out.
3378960	3380960	March 23rd in support of charity.
3380960	3384960	Everything will be garage sale priced.
3384960	3385960	That's it.
3386960	3387960	And the vanilla.
3387960	3389960	Very nice.
3389960	3391960	Very nice.
3391960	3395960	Mitch is going to be donating a lot of his new...
3395960	3398960	He's writing a new script and he's going to put it on a thing.
3398960	3400960	All of his ideas, his whiteboards.
3400960	3402960	All my stuff is brand new.
3402960	3404960	Because I just throw away anything that...
3404960	3406960	I sort of live this...
3406960	3408960	I don't know if it's environmentally sound.
3408960	3409960	We think it is.
3409960	3410960	It's recyclable.
3410960	3413960	Everything is constantly new in our house.
3413960	3415960	I mean, I like this jacket.
3415960	3416960	It's in the trash tomorrow.
3416960	3418960	You were feeling sexy when you got dressed tonight, right?
3418960	3419960	What?
3419960	3421960	You were feeling very sexy when you got dressed tonight.
3421960	3422960	Really?
3422960	3423960	Yeah.
3423960	3424960	Does it seem that way?
3424960	3425960	Knock it off!
3426960	3427960	Dan, wake up!
3427960	3428960	Wake up, Dan!
3428960	3429960	Wake up!
3430960	3432960	That's nice of you to say.
3435960	3437960	I'd like to pay myself a compliment.
3437960	3441960	But when I woke up from the love of my life punching me in the mouth,
3442960	3444960	I was like, we'll talk about it in the morning
3444960	3446960	and just put a pillow between us and went back to sleep.
3446960	3450960	You were the second woman in 41 years
3450960	3453960	that I have physically assaulted in my sleep.
3454960	3455960	Aww.
3461960	3465960	That was the third time I've been assaulted by that dance.
3466960	3470960	My girlfriend, Allison, in my 20s,
3470960	3472960	went to visit my parents in Florida.
3472960	3474960	Wait, Allison with the flat nose?
3474960	3475960	Allison with that broken...
3475960	3476960	Yeah.
3476960	3477960	She dated...
3477960	3478960	She dated Elvis Costello.
3478960	3480960	She was sleeping in our parents' guest room,
3480960	3486960	and at the time I was reading a lot of alien abduction books
3486960	3489960	because I was writing a script
3489960	3492960	that was going to be an alien abduction comedy
3493960	3496960	that I hoped that perhaps Mr. Sandler might read.
3498960	3499960	Who knows?
3500960	3502960	Kevin James as lead alien.
3502960	3507960	And I was half asleep and you're in that weird fugue state
3507960	3511960	where you think you're awake but you're asleep or whatever.
3511960	3517960	I rolled over and I realized that I was in bed with a gray.
3518960	3520960	There was an alien face.
3520960	3521960	Yeah.
3521960	3524960	I had a Whitley Stryber alien face
3524960	3526960	staring at me on the pillow next to me
3526960	3527960	and I went...
3527960	3530960	And I flailed physically.
3530960	3532960	I was like, get this alien away from me
3532960	3533960	the way you would with an alien.
3533960	3535960	You know, there's an alien laying in bed.
3535960	3537960	You know who else has had that experience?
3537960	3539960	Everyone who's ever thought they saw an alien.
3539960	3540960	By the way.
3542960	3543960	By any way, go ahead.
3543960	3547960	And I flailed and in flailing my knuckles hit.
3547960	3551960	I mean, I hit my lover in the face
3552960	3554960	getting this alien away from me
3554960	3557960	and then came to and my poor girlfriend is going,
3557960	3558960	you...
3558960	3559960	Excuse me.
3559960	3561960	That's not part of the story.
3562960	3565960	I've never seen anyone sneeze on stage.
3565960	3567960	It's actually impossible.
3567960	3570960	I didn't know it was possible to sneeze on stage.
3570960	3571960	I don't think...
3571960	3572960	I never thought it was.
3572960	3573960	It's weird, isn't it?
3573960	3575960	I'm just allergic to entertainment.
3576960	3577960	I've had that theory a long time,
3577960	3578960	but now it's finally proven.
3578960	3579960	But, you know, what was your name?
3579960	3580960	Alyssa?
3580960	3581960	Allison.
3581960	3582960	Allison.
3584960	3587960	She had a tattoo of a son in the middle of her back
3587960	3589960	and a half-made mermaid tattoo
3589960	3590960	in the inside of her thigh.
3590960	3592960	No, you're merging two women.
3596960	3599960	Allison had a son tattoo on her back.
3599960	3601960	You're thinking of a different person
3601960	3602960	with the mermaid tattoo.
3602960	3603960	Great.
3605960	3606960	Who was that person?
3606960	3607960	Now I know there's another person.
3607960	3608960	I thought I was the same person.
3608960	3613960	I assume that son tattoo would also have mermaid thigh tattoo.
3613960	3616960	That's what you don't understand about women.
3616960	3619960	No woman would have both of those things.
3619960	3621960	Son tattoo on the back girl has Japanese kanji
3621960	3623960	that says strength on her ankle.
3625960	3626960	I think we've all known that.
3626960	3628960	It was a different time.
3628960	3630960	And it was your own fault for probing you, right?
3630960	3631960	I mean, that might have been part of it.
3631960	3632960	Maybe she was an alien.
3632960	3633960	I don't know.
3633960	3634960	Maybe I saw her true form.
3635960	3636960	That's interesting.
3637960	3640960	And so that's the second time that I've actually
3640960	3642960	hurt someone that I was in bed with.
3642960	3645960	So you woke up and your fist made contact.
3645960	3646960	Right.
3646960	3647960	Thank you.
3648960	3650960	Matthew McConaughey reference.
3650960	3651960	He was in the movie Contact.
3651960	3652960	That's great.
3652960	3653960	But I've told the story before.
3653960	3654960	The show's over.
3656960	3657960	Everybody out.
3657960	3660960	I had a dream once where Bruce Willis was taunting me
3660960	3663960	and I was fighting Bruce Willis
3663960	3668960	and I was, thankfully, thank God I was alone at the time.
3668960	3671960	I was sleeping in a single mattress in my two bedroom apartment
3671960	3676960	and in my dream, Bruce Willis was taunting me.
3676960	3679960	And I, again, with the thing where you're like,
3679960	3681960	I can't move my arms and then you just go,
3681960	3683960	fuck you, Bruce Willis.
3683960	3686960	If it was witty taunting, that's how you can tell.
3686960	3687960	He was just smirking.
3687960	3688960	He was smirking.
3688960	3689960	Yeah, no.
3689960	3694960	Capri or Seagram's Golden Wine Cooler's Smirk.
3694960	3700960	And I just lunged at him and woke up as my fist collided
3700960	3702960	with the plaster wall next to my bed.
3702960	3703960	Oh, no.
3703960	3704960	Like really hard.
3704960	3707960	And the thing that always blows me away about that
3707960	3712960	is the idea that some way of looking at the universe,
3712960	3715960	our unconscious dream characters, they have a life of their own.
3715960	3717960	They exist because we make them exist.
3717960	3722960	And they're accountable to our wakefulness or sleepfulness.
3722960	3726960	They resent us for being gods that they can't control.
3726960	3728960	They know that they're going to all die no matter what
3728960	3730960	as soon as we wake up.
3730960	3732960	The real Bruce does not know.
3732960	3735960	One guy in the figment of my unconscious mind,
3735960	3738960	one hero, this Bruce Willis guy, in one dream,
3738960	3742960	knowing that he was going to die along with the rest of dream world,
3742960	3745960	like he accomplished this Promethean task.
3746960	3749960	He bruised my knuckles.
3749960	3754960	He reached out across the threshold between sleep and awake
3754960	3755960	and fucked with me.
3755960	3757960	And won a fight with you.
3757960	3761960	There would be a statue of him built outside of Dream City
3761960	3764960	if those fucking assholes could live past today.
3764960	3765960	Yeah, right.
3765960	3766960	He hurt someone.
3766960	3768960	He hurt one of the real people.
3768960	3770960	He'd be the president of dreams.
3770960	3772960	Well, fuck Dream City because in Dream City
3772960	3775960	they administered that fucking I can't run or walk
3775960	3778960	and the gun doesn't shoot, nothing fucking works drug on you.
3778960	3782960	And so they always win this fucking Dream City, motherfuckers.
3782960	3783960	Fuck those guys.
3783960	3785960	Is this a real thing or is this a movie?
3785960	3788960	Sweetie.
3788960	3791960	Did I tell you about the dream when I was JJ from Good Times
3791960	3795960	and I was fucking Thelma the whole time?
3795960	3797960	You get that in every show.
3797960	3798960	Unbelievable.
3798960	3799960	Never.
3799960	3802960	It's an unmistakable agenda.
3802960	3804960	Okay, so amazing.
3804960	3808960	Bruce Willis, not the sharpest dude, apparently.
3808960	3810960	Did you read Kevin Smith's book?
3810960	3811960	No.
3811960	3812960	Oh, it's amazing.
3812960	3813960	Kevin Smith talks shit about him?
3813960	3814960	Oh my God, yeah.
3814960	3816960	And every other sentence keeps saying,
3816960	3818960	I mean, he's a hero of mine and what a fucking asshole.
3818960	3821960	And I actually was at a party with him once and I had like-
3821960	3823960	You were at a party with Bruce Willis?
3823960	3826960	Yeah, my friend Kevin Rooney knows all these guys
3826960	3828960	because he was a comic, you know?
3828960	3829960	Bruce Willis.
3829960	3832960	Yeah, so that whole class of comics knows him
3832960	3835960	and he walked up and my friend Kevin was holding a-
3835960	3837960	That whole class of comics.
3837960	3839960	It's true, it's like one year, you know?
3839960	3841960	There's also a jazz musician somewhere saying like,
3841960	3844960	well, you know, Bruce was a jazz musician.
3844960	3847960	Well, that's his real gift.
3847960	3851960	But he walked up to my friend who was holding a cookie
3851960	3855960	and he wanted to make a joke and the joke he came up with is-
3855960	3857960	What do you got there, a donut?
3861960	3863960	He smirked away.
3863960	3865960	Wonderful!
3865960	3869960	Well, a donut has a hole in the middle and this is a-
3869960	3871960	Isn't that a crazy story?
3871960	3874960	I saw Bruce Willis at a bar one time when I was like 24
3874960	3878960	and I was dating a girl who looked enough like Demi Moore to-
3878960	3882960	You can say that Bruce Willis might have a Demi Moore type.
3882960	3886960	She had like the kind of like just above the shoulder black bobbed hair,
3886960	3889960	like a similar size, didn't look facially like her.
3889960	3893960	But I was in a bar in Hollywood and there was like-
3893960	3895960	It was like some sort of party or something, I don't know what it was.
3895960	3900960	And I was going to the men's room and I was standing next to my date
3900960	3906960	and he saw her from across the room and did like-
3906960	3909960	It was like a Cirque du Soleil act, watching him get across the room.
3909960	3911960	There's people in the way and there's couches.
3911960	3915960	And he was doing front like tumbles and back handsprings
3915960	3920960	and he grabbed like a vine that we didn't know existed in the ceiling and swooped across.
3920960	3923960	He went through an air vent, he had to light it with his zippo.
3923960	3928960	A German guy with blonde hair shot the glass and his shoes were off and he still made it.
3928960	3935960	And then the final obstacle, and I kind of see this Tasmanian devil of energy coming
3935960	3942960	and navigating any slight breach in the wall of humanity and furniture that was there.
3942960	3945960	The only thing that was finally in his way was the guy standing right next to her
3945960	3947960	and he line-backered me out of the way.
3947960	3948960	No.
3948960	3949960	Like just like-
3949960	3953960	He's got to lay that donut line on her probably.
3953960	3958960	Well she was wearing a skirt and he couldn't wait to ask, are those pants?
3958960	3959960	What are those pants?
3959960	3961960	What are you wearing, is that a pantser?
3961960	3963960	I was at a Hollywood party once.
3963960	3965960	Wait, what's the end of this?
3965960	3968960	The end of the story is me getting up and the thing is he didn't see me.
3968960	3971960	He hadn't made eye contact with me and said, I must destroy this guy.
3971960	3977960	I was just simply a chess piece that was on an adjacent square that needed to be like knocked away
3977960	3979960	so he could occupy that square.
3979960	3985960	And he just came up to her and just was laying this really like heavy, not charming,
3985960	3989960	just like Sprechensee Pernum, like look at this memory of this whole face,
3989960	3991960	like you and me, I'm Bruce Wells.
3991960	3994960	And she was like, she kind of gave him the flick of the shoulder like, go away.
3994960	3995960	Wow.
3995960	4000960	And he went like, just shrank down and just cruised off and kind of unfazed.
4000960	4003960	Like it was off to his next weird nonconquest.
4003960	4007960	But I wanted to go like, hey, fucking fuck you.
4007960	4009960	Yeah, I'm kidding.
4009960	4012960	Hey, fucking California.
4012960	4016960	I saw him try to eat a tree stump once.
4016960	4018960	He tried to eat a tree stump?
4018960	4020960	Timing was better earlier.
4020960	4024960	It was one of these times when like it would have been like,
4024960	4028960	and then I said, I've never interacted with Bruce Willis.
4028960	4031960	I just thought like maybe the dumbest thing would be to try to eat a tree stump.
4031960	4032960	Well, we have a surprise for you tonight.
4032960	4033960	Let's bring him out.
4033960	4034960	Let's bring him out.
4034960	4035960	Jan and I.
4035960	4041960	Hey, hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm Bruce Willis.
4041960	4044960	Yo, yo, I'm going to thrill this.
4044960	4046960	Yo, I'm Bruce Willis from down here.
4046960	4047960	What you doing?
4047960	4049960	Yo, taking foot but my yard.
4049960	4051960	Yo, Bruce Willis in the house.
4051960	4055960	I heard you're cool with your ex's new boyfriends.
4055960	4057960	Thank you.
4057960	4060960	You must be really open minded.
4060960	4063960	Yeah.
4063960	4065960	Bruce, who are you rapping with?
4065960	4067960	Who is that character that?
4067960	4071960	You know, you bring some people out and they help you out sometimes.
4071960	4073960	Thank you. Thank you, Cindy.
4074960	4075960	You're welcome.
4075960	4080960	I'll be in the back trying to eat all the paper.
4080960	4081960	That's what she does.
4081960	4082960	Totally.
4082960	4084960	There's a side story.
4084960	4085960	I know.
4085960	4088960	I never realized I didn't have an ending to that Bruce Willis story.
4088960	4091960	I always thought it was enough to say Bruce Willis tried to knock me over
4091960	4092960	and actually kind of half did.
4092960	4094960	I was like halfway to the ground before I recovered.
4094960	4095960	But the thing is.
4095960	4096960	You're a good ending.
4096960	4097960	You're a good ending.
4097960	4099960	I'm rather in Philadelphia.
4099960	4100960	That's really good.
4100960	4102960	You're not a good ending to that story.
4102960	4105960	And then he went on to make like eight horrible movies.
4105960	4106960	That would be a good.
4106960	4107960	Seven.
4107960	4108960	Seven.
4108960	4109960	Seven.
4109960	4113960	Woody Harrelson gave me a black eye.
4113960	4115960	Woody Harrelson gave me a black eye.
4115960	4117960	We're talking about celebrity interruptions.
4117960	4120960	Who was the black guy?
4120960	4123960	This is 1853.
4123960	4126960	You were allowed to give someone a black eye.
4126960	4130960	A little bow wow.
4130960	4135960	What precipitated him giving you a black eye?
4135960	4140960	Through a series of unimportant events, I ended up at an impromptu
4140960	4144960	basketball game following the premiere of semi-pro.
4144960	4152960	And there were ten people that were really famous.
4152960	4155960	And I was the only unfamous person at the UCB theater.
4155960	4159960	And they were playing a pickup game of basketball on the stage of the UCB
4159960	4160960	theater, which was really small.
4160960	4161960	And I was the only girl.
4161960	4163960	And Woody was like, hey, darling, come on.
4163960	4166960	I was like, oh, yeah.
4166960	4167960	And I walked down.
4167960	4169960	I didn't do that.
4169960	4171960	I looked really cute.
4171960	4172960	I was a little thinner.
4172960	4175960	And I walked down on the stage and played basketball.
4175960	4179960	And Woody Harrelson, I was on the other team.
4179960	4181960	And he elbowed me in the eye.
4181960	4182960	Everyone saw him.
4182960	4184960	He didn't do it on purpose.
4184960	4186960	We don't know that.
4186960	4188960	No, we don't.
4188960	4191960	Listen, when you're playing a basketball game on the UCB theater,
4191960	4192960	it's serious.
4192960	4197960	You do what you have to do to make the fucking shot, I guess.
4197960	4201960	The stakes are high when you're in the show.
4201960	4204960	The famous people that I met, it was a bunch of comics.
4204960	4207960	But everyone was really like, oh, my god, Woody Harrelson's here.
4207960	4208960	Woody Harrelson's here.
4208960	4212960	So everyone saw him elbow me in the eye.
4212960	4214960	And I went to the ground.
4214960	4215960	But I tried to pull it together.
4215960	4217960	But then because it was Woody Harrelson, everyone's like,
4217960	4218960	you're fine, Aaron, right?
4218960	4221960	Because they're worried that the game was going to end because I
4221960	4223960	got elbowed in the eye.
4223960	4224960	That's terrible.
4224960	4226960	And Woody was like, hey, darling, did I hate you?
4226960	4227960	And I was like, no.
4227960	4228960	But like, oh, he really?
4228960	4231960	I had a black eye for a week because of Woody Harrelson.
4231960	4234960	The concern was not for a wounded person
4234960	4236960	or maybe the only woman on stage.
4236960	4239960	But the celebrity might fly the coop.
4239960	4242960	Well, I mean, I didn't want to be wounded.
4242960	4244960	But I did for the rest of the night, everyone saw my face just
4244960	4245960	get bigger and bigger.
4245960	4247960	And everyone was pretending that it wasn't happening.
4247960	4249960	Because you don't want him to say something like, hey, man,
4249960	4253960	if everyone's going to complain about me busting their eyes,
4253960	4256960	I'll just go.
4256960	4259960	This seems like coming down here and playing basketball
4259960	4261960	is not too high maintenance.
4261960	4262960	I certainly.
4262960	4263960	I definitely.
4263960	4264960	Yo.
4264960	4265960	Yo.
4265960	4266960	Yo.
4266960	4267960	Yo.
4267960	4268960	Woody Harrelson.
4268960	4269960	No.
4269960	4270960	No.
4270960	4271960	Woody Harrelson.
4271960	4272960	No.
4272960	4273960	No.
4273960	4274960	Woody Harrelson.
4274960	4278960	I'm chewing my cock.
4278960	4280960	Get me some more Harrelson rap for guns.
4280960	4281960	No.
4281960	4282960	No.
4282960	4283960	Yeah.
4283960	4284960	Woody Harrelson.
4284960	4285960	No.
4285960	4286960	No.
4286960	4287960	No.
4287960	4288960	When you rap like Woody Harrelson.
4288960	4289960	Oh, yeah, you always stop.
4289960	4290960	I stop when you start rapping.
4290960	4291960	You always stop.
4291960	4292960	You always stop.
4292960	4293960	If you give me a look like you're done, then I stop.
4293960	4295960	I don't give you a look like nothing.
4295960	4296960	All right.
4296960	4297960	Get out of here.
4297960	4300960	I give you a look like I'm on fire.
4300960	4302960	Oh, so I got the look like get me out of here.
4302960	4303960	No, I don't know about that.
4303960	4309960	Okay, now, again, I'm not saying that your iced tea and your Vincent Price is totally touched.
4309960	4314960	You want to know what it would sound like if Woody Harrelson and Sammy Davis Jr. rap together.
4314960	4315960	Wait.
4315960	4316960	Oh, God.
4316960	4320960	Because, I mean, at least let them introduce themselves subsequently.
4320960	4321960	Yo.
4321960	4322960	Yo.
4322960	4323960	Yo.
4323960	4324960	Yo.
4324960	4325960	Yo.
4325960	4326960	Yo.
4326960	4327960	I don't know which one you're doing.
4327960	4328960	No.
4328960	4329960	Okay.
4329960	4330960	They're different sides of his mouth.
4330960	4331960	Look closely.
4331960	4332960	Look closely.
4332960	4333960	Yeah.
4333960	4334960	Yeah.
4334960	4335960	That's Sammy.
4335960	4336960	No, that was Woody.
4336960	4337960	That was Woody.
4337960	4338960	Woody, go to the left.
4338960	4339960	No.
4339960	4340960	Woody, go to the left.
4340960	4341960	All right.
4341960	4342960	That's Woody.
4342960	4343960	My name is Woody Harrelson.
4343960	4345960	I'm here to say I'm from somewhere in the Midwest today.
4345960	4347960	When I rap, I like to chew my mouth.
4347960	4350960	I look like I'm chewing from the south.
4350960	4353960	I kind of slur my lips around.
4353960	4356960	I'm rapping on the ground.
4356960	4357960	Double palsy.
4357960	4358960	Woody Harrelson.
4358960	4359960	Double palsy.
4359960	4360960	Woody Harrelson.
4361960	4364960	Hey, babe.
4364960	4367960	Spiders crawling out of this closet.
4367960	4368960	Where was he?
4368960	4370960	Spooky, ooky.
4370960	4371960	Yeah.
4371960	4372960	This was written by Vincent.
4372960	4374960	Creepy crawlies, babe.
4374960	4375960	No.
4375960	4376960	No.
4376960	4377960	Yeah.
4377960	4378960	You wanted it.
4378960	4379960	You got it.
4379960	4380960	No.
4380960	4385960	Um, tonight has been just a field of dreams for me.
4385960	4388960	Yeah.
4388960	4390960	And believe me, the last thing I would ever want to do
4390960	4392960	is stop a beat before you were done rapping.
4392960	4394960	There was a very subtle thing going on there
4394960	4397960	because, you know, Sammy didn't write the songs he sang.
4397960	4400960	So he was doing a song that clearly Vincent Price wrote.
4400960	4404960	That was a very subtle piece.
4404960	4406960	Spiders.
4406960	4407960	It's true.
4407960	4410960	Most people who end up doing bridges,
4410960	4413960	there was a guy who wrote bridges to pop songs,
4413960	4416960	and he was a very horror-oriented guy.
4416960	4417960	Yeah.
4417960	4419960	So when you come in, you have to talk about spiders and coffins.
4419960	4420960	Yeah.
4420960	4421960	Always the best bridge man in town.
4421960	4422960	Get me.
4422960	4423960	Hey, kid.
4423960	4424960	It's a great song.
4424960	4425960	It's a great song.
4425960	4426960	I love the hook.
4426960	4427960	The verses are great.
4427960	4428960	But your bridge...
4428960	4430960	Can we bring in a professional...
4430960	4431960	You won, McClintock.
4431960	4432960	You won.
4432960	4434960	He writes a spooky bridge.
4434960	4437960	He's been Vincent Price's guy for 20 years.
4437960	4440960	But, sir, this is a love song.
4440960	4442960	We're making a love song.
4442960	4444960	It's about a woman that I saw on a beach.
4444960	4446960	Yeah, but couldn't there be a coffin or a ghoul?
4446960	4448960	Kids love a spooky bridge.
4448960	4449960	Yeah.
4449960	4450960	Give the kids what they want.
4450960	4451960	They want the monsters to mash,
4451960	4454960	and they want the ghoulie-the-louie.
4454960	4456960	They want a celebrity to do it.
4456960	4460960	Vincent Price, he owned the spooky bridge.
4460960	4462960	Yeah, and it wasn't because he was Mr. Spooky,
4462960	4465960	it was because McClintock's words didn't need the...
4465960	4468960	The piano doesn't write the concerto, cocksucker.
4468960	4472960	It's the fucking...
4472960	4473960	You want to work in this town.
4473960	4475960	You want to sell records?
4475960	4478960	You put a spooky ooky in there.
4478960	4480960	Aww.
4480960	4483960	This is my first attempt at a Woody Harrelson...
4483960	4484960	But the jaw thing is interesting.
4484960	4488960	Wait, see, now you gotta move your mouth around.
4488960	4489960	You almost went Jodie Foster then.
4489960	4491960	I don't know if you start to...
4491960	4494960	If you start to put your tongue in your cheek,
4494960	4496960	it'll go a little bit of shell.
4496960	4498960	Shell?
4498960	4500960	Shell?
4500960	4502960	Woody Harrelson.
4502960	4505960	So you do a spot on Matthew McConaughey, right?
4505960	4507960	Can we see these two guys at a drive-through movie?
4507960	4509960	I'd rather try to...
4509960	4512960	I've gone right at it, but I'd rather show you my Cher,
4512960	4514960	because that's what you were doing.
4514960	4516960	What if Cher came to a drive-through
4516960	4520960	and Woody Harrelson was working the drive-through?
4520960	4522960	I'll be Woody Harrelson.
4522960	4525960	Yeah, let's try it. Let's do it.
4525960	4528960	Well, welcome to the burger restaurant, ma'am.
4528960	4530960	Can I help you?
4530960	4534960	Oh, well, I'm Cher, as you know.
4534960	4540960	And I hate those tree people, because I killed my husband.
4545960	4547960	Well, I'm on phone now. It's over.
4547960	4549960	No, I'm giving you the look. It ended.
4549960	4552960	That was it. No, this one's not over.
4552960	4554960	This one is not over. Cher wrapped...
4554960	4555960	That's understanding of trees.
4555960	4556960	I don't care for your talk.
4556960	4558960	That is me, Cher.
4559960	4562960	We will be here till... We'll serve fucking breakfast.
4565960	4567960	I have dreams just like this.
4567960	4569960	And I always punch my wife at the end of the book.
4569960	4572960	We came so close to Cher after.
4572960	4576960	What was your character? A little bit Lily Tomlin and things?
4576960	4578960	I can do it.
4578960	4580960	It's been a while, actually.
4580960	4582960	As I started that, it was probably what you felt,
4582960	4585960	which is like, wait, who's Cher?
4585960	4587960	It's been a while.
4587960	4591960	I'm not joking. Dan, you tiptoed into Jodie Foster.
4591960	4595960	Oh, yeah. Oh, Dr. Lecter. I'm sorry.
4596960	4600960	Woody Harrelson, I don't understand what you're saying.
4600960	4603960	Well, good damn, young lady. I'm Woody Harrelson.
4603960	4605960	I'm Jodie Foster.
4605960	4607960	Oh, you know what? I haven't heard you do it in a long time.
4607960	4609960	I love your Matt Damon. You do a good Matt Damon.
4609960	4610960	What?
4610960	4612960	Oh, it's a shrub. What are you doing with Matt Damon?
4612960	4615960	No, no, no. Wahlberg and me. I mean Wahlberg.
4615960	4616960	Mark Wahlberg.
4616960	4617960	No, that's true.
4617960	4618960	Oh, fuck. God damn it. That's a goodie.
4618960	4619960	We should get him out here.
4619960	4622960	I mean, I thought that was my first Woody Harrelson.
4622960	4625960	What I am is an artist. I'm an outsider artist.
4625960	4627960	I'm not an impressionist.
4627960	4631960	That was the first time I've ever attempted and nailed a Woody Harrelson.
4631960	4634960	Woody Harrelson. If we heard Woody Harrelson, we could do it, though.
4634960	4635960	He's got it.
4635960	4638960	It's kind of weird. Woody Harrelson.
4638960	4641960	You're just going to move your mouth around a little bit.
4641960	4643960	That is a sling blade.
4643960	4646960	I want some French fry for entertainers.
4646960	4652960	You look like Woody Harrelson in the last 10 minutes of The People versus Larry Flynn.
4652960	4655960	Or if you had Bell's palsy.
4655960	4656960	Or just Larry Flynn.
4656960	4664960	Do you think there's any chance that Liam Neeson might rap ever in his life?
4664960	4669960	I don't know Liam. I'm a big fan of his, but I don't know if he's a rapper.
4669960	4672960	It doesn't matter if you know Liam Neeson.
4673960	4675960	He's going to rap.
4677960	4679960	Liam Neeson.
4679960	4683960	Yo, yo, yo.
4683960	4685960	I'm Liam Neeson.
4685960	4688960	Yo, yo, yo.
4688960	4691960	It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong.
4691960	4694960	It doesn't matter if you rap or sing a song.
4694960	4698960	I'm Liam Neeson. I'm from the streets.
4698960	4702960	I'm going to tell you something. You need to hear it.
4703960	4705960	Pay attention.
4705960	4709960	Or you'll regret it.
4709960	4712960	I'm Liam Neeson.
4712960	4714960	I don't sweat it.
4714960	4716960	Four o'clock in the morning.
4716960	4721960	Got a beeper on my cell phone going out for it in the...
4721960	4724960	I'm going to give Sling some rock.
4724960	4727960	Doesn't matter if it's down the block.
4727960	4730960	I've got ice to sling.
4731960	4734960	Doesn't matter if I sing.
4734960	4737960	I'm a fucking crack dealer.
4737960	4740960	I deal crack.
4741960	4744960	Deal with it.
4744960	4747960	Neeson style.
4747960	4751960	Doesn't matter what it costs.
4751960	4754960	It's just crack.
4754960	4757960	Five dollars.
4757960	4760960	Sean Connery, Spooky Bridge.
4760960	4764960	Sean Connery, Spooky Bridge by Sean Connery.
4764960	4768960	Coffins with spiders inside.
4768960	4772960	Coming out, your mouth opens wide.
4772960	4776960	Spooky skeletons and ghosts.
4776960	4780960	All kinds of S sounds.
4780960	4782960	Doesn't matter.
4782960	4786960	Don't listen to him. Listen to me.
4786960	4789960	Don't Sean Connery.
4789960	4792960	What Liam Neeson?
4794960	4797960	Let's go get a sandwich.
4797960	4800960	It doesn't matter what kind of sandwich you want.
4800960	4803960	That's my line.
4805960	4808960	Now this was...
4811960	4813960	It really has been a magnificent evening.
4813960	4817960	This show has crossed over for the first time into the realm of art.
4817960	4821960	In fairness, that was right after McClintock had a stroke.
4821960	4824960	And he was still, we thought, does he still have it?
4824960	4827960	McClintock was what, in his 80s or mid 80s?
4827960	4829960	He was up there.
4829960	4831960	He definitely started phoning it in.
4831960	4835960	He would send people just stacks of index cards of what it would say, skeletons.
4835960	4838960	Coffins.
4838960	4842960	He also made that deal with Brock's Candies at that point, which was just tragic.
4842960	4847960	There was that Billboard headline that McClintock's gone back to the grave once too many times.
4847960	4848960	Right.
4848960	4851960	And then he did that whole Easter thing for a while.
4851960	4852960	Oh my God.
4852960	4853960	The Cadbury...
4853960	4854960	How can we forget that?
4854960	4855960	He tried.
4855960	4856960	No, leave him alone.
4856960	4858960	And then he transitioned and they promised him.
4858960	4860960	Yo, yo, standard rapper.
4860960	4862960	Just rapping like a rapper.
4862960	4864960	Standard rapper just to play the straight line.
4864960	4867960	Rapping about this, rapping about yours and mine.
4867960	4869960	From the street and I'm rapping two and three.
4869960	4872960	Gotta rap to the you, gotta rap to the me.
4872960	4874960	Gotta rap about the street experience.
4874960	4875960	Gotta rap to everything.
4875960	4878960	Gotta drop the difference.
4878960	4882960	A rock moving from a cave.
4882960	4886960	A Messiah is reborn.
4886960	4891960	A shroud with a face imprinted on it.
4891960	4894960	Eggs hidden.
4894960	4896960	I'm trying to figure out who this is.
4896960	4897960	I don't know who that was.
4897960	4898960	I think it's Heston.
4899960	4900960	Was that Heston?
4900960	4902960	Was that Heston?
4902960	4904960	Richard Widmark.
4904960	4905960	Was that a Widmark?
4905960	4907960	I think at that stage of his career,
4907960	4909960	there was no A-list people doing his work.
4909960	4910960	No, no, no.
4910960	4912960	He was going back to the Widmarks.
4912960	4916960	Those were people who were selling you their CD outside 7-Eleven.
4916960	4918960	It was just with incense and stuff.
4918960	4921960	It's a shame to see a star falling, McClintock.
4921960	4922960	Yeah.
4922960	4925960	I'm McClintock, the writer of Spooky Bridge.
4926960	4932960	My friend Jim went to meet with Jerry Lewis once
4932960	4936960	to talk about making the Nutty Professor into a musical.
4936960	4940960	And one of the things that Jerry Lewis kept saying is,
4940960	4942960	I've got a prop guy.
4942960	4944960	He's the best.
4944960	4947960	And I think of that when we talk about McClintock.
4947960	4949960	I'll call this prop guy when we're ready.
4949960	4950960	He's the best.
4950960	4953960	You haven't seen an umbrella.
4953960	4955960	This guy has an umbrella.
4955960	4957960	We're going to do a Broadway play.
4957960	4958960	Did you see the day the clown cried,
4958960	4960960	that big, thick screenplay that exists out there?
4960960	4962960	I've never seen the screenplay. I know about it.
4962960	4964960	And then there's a note in the screenplay that Jerry Lewis wrote
4964960	4966960	that says about the shoes.
4966960	4968960	And there's an annotation that says,
4968960	4972960	we need to discuss the shoes with props or something like that.
4972960	4975960	That's when he found this new prop guy.
4977960	4980960	You guys ever take our clown class?
4980960	4982960	I'm willing to. Show us.
4982960	4984960	Take us through it.
4984960	4986960	That sounded like I was about to teach you a clown class.
4986960	4989960	I thought I was sure that's what was coming next.
4989960	4992960	This certainly sounds like we're in for a clown class story.
4992960	4994960	Yeah, we'd love to take a clown class.
4994960	4996960	Absolutely.
4998960	5001960	I asked a question because I think most people my age that were theater majors,
5001960	5003960	you have to take a clown class,
5003960	5007960	and you have to reduce your personality to one emotion,
5007960	5009960	and that is your clown?
5009960	5011960	Dingleberry.
5011960	5013960	What was your emotion?
5013960	5015960	About to yawn.
5016960	5018960	Bemused resignation.
5018960	5022960	Just an about to yawn clown at all times.
5025960	5032960	That face you make right before the nose starts to flare.
5032960	5034960	Nobody gets this. What? I've been doing this.
5034960	5036960	I traveled with this.
5036960	5039960	I've won one clown competition.
5040960	5042960	I don't think this is totally representative of me,
5042960	5048960	but when I was 17, my clown was like a really careless, clumsy clown.
5048960	5050960	Whereas now...
5050960	5052960	How'd you come up with that?
5052960	5054960	It was given to you.
5054960	5057960	I was going to say. It's a pretty standard clown.
5057960	5059960	I mean, they're not great with their hands.
5059960	5062960	Mitch, if you were in a clown class,
5062960	5067960	and you had to very quickly choose your essential clown quality.
5068960	5071960	If it wasn't about to yawn,
5071960	5073960	sleepy.
5073960	5075960	Sleepy.
5075960	5079960	Or actually, too hot would be a good clown.
5079960	5082960	Just constantly like wedding sweater.
5082960	5084960	It's too hot.
5084960	5086960	Can you talk as a clown? Is that an option?
5086960	5088960	You cannot talk as a clown.
5088960	5090960	For your final, you cannot talk.
5090960	5092960	That makes it too hot a little harder.
5092960	5094960	They can go...
5094960	5096960	They can do that, right?
5096960	5099960	The Cirque de Soleil, and you start the show, and the guy goes,
5099960	5101960	Ay, ay, ay.
5101960	5103960	Terrifying.
5103960	5105960	I think I would do rethinking Christianity.
5105960	5107960	It would be like a clown.
5107960	5110960	A clown that was raised, Lutherans say,
5110960	5112960	or Catholic.
5112960	5115960	And maybe it's like half the genuflection,
5115960	5118960	and he just stares off.
5118960	5121960	Big eyebrows.
5121960	5123960	All right, so it's at that point in the show
5123960	5126960	where usually, for the last eight years or so,
5126960	5128960	we would usually bring out Spencer.
5128960	5131960	Spencer Clements!
5131960	5134960	He's not here.
5134960	5136960	He's got the week off.
5136960	5138960	That's right.
5138960	5140960	He was...
5140960	5143960	Dan punched him in his sleep, you know.
5143960	5146960	Spencer was watching like Water for Chocolate,
5146960	5151960	and Dan stabbed him with a butter knife.
5151960	5153960	We had a conversation about it, and it turns out,
5153960	5155960	hindsight being 20-20, Spencer's the only one
5155960	5158960	who was never told, unlike all of us,
5158960	5161960	that he didn't have to do the show if he didn't want to.
5161960	5163960	Well, who told him that?
5163960	5165960	Why was he...
5165960	5167960	No one ever told him anything.
5167960	5169960	He just kind of fell into this thing,
5169960	5171960	and he was doing this thing,
5171960	5173960	and he felt like he had to do it,
5173960	5175960	or else there would be horrible repercussions if he didn't do it.
5175960	5176960	He did.
5176960	5178960	And he wasn't having a good time doing it all the time,
5178960	5180960	and he felt forced to do it.
5180960	5182960	We haven't really been up to...
5182960	5188960	I mean, not that there is any expectations that he puts on us,
5188960	5190960	but if there were an expectation,
5190960	5192960	we were underneath that expectation.
5192960	5194960	I'm glad you said that. You should be more focused.
5194960	5197960	As D&D campaigners, we don't...
5197960	5200960	Yeah, certainly by Gen Con tournament rules,
5200960	5202960	definitely bad D&D.
5202960	5203960	We don't remember what happens.
5203960	5205960	We play too short a round.
5205960	5207960	We all have an inventory full of awesome shit
5207960	5209960	that we've never used.
5209960	5212960	The word to believe is that there's something
5212960	5215960	that he'd rather be doing than playing Dungeons & Dragons
5215960	5217960	on a Sunday night.
5217960	5219960	I misjudged this man.
5219960	5221960	We should have had him tailed,
5221960	5224960	and he's at the batting cages right now.
5224960	5227960	He's playing Magic the Gathering.
5227960	5230960	It's really not that he doesn't want to do it or anything.
5230960	5233960	No, he absolutely does. He loves doing it.
5233960	5236960	I was horrified to find out,
5236960	5238960	mortified to find out that he...
5238960	5240960	I never really thought about it,
5240960	5242960	that he felt like he had to do it.
5242960	5245960	I would never want anyone feeling like they had to do something.
5245960	5247960	Kumail texts me...
5247960	5249960	We never had a single conversation about it.
5249960	5253960	Kumail texts me every week that says either,
5253960	5256960	I got an early call time tomorrow,
5256960	5258960	or I'll see you tonight. It doesn't matter.
5258960	5261960	Jeff always has a reason to...
5261960	5264960	If he's not going to be here, it's because he's got some gig,
5264960	5266960	and so we try to replace him.
5266960	5268960	The roof wouldn't necessarily cave in.
5268960	5270960	We haven't not had a comptroller yet,
5270960	5272960	but Aaron comes and goes.
5272960	5275960	Dispenser was brought up out of the audience.
5275960	5277960	Indispensable.
5277960	5279960	And never...
5279960	5281960	You put yourself in his shoes,
5281960	5283960	and you think he never actually had an opportunity
5283960	5285960	to know whether or not...
5285960	5287960	What if he were to come up in the green room and go,
5287960	5291960	Yeah, I don't want to play D&T this week.
5291960	5293960	I think I would like to go...
5293960	5295960	What would you like to play?
5296960	5298960	There was that moment in last week's show,
5298960	5300960	I think, where he said,
5300960	5302960	Why did you guys bring me up?
5302960	5305960	We keep bringing him up and not talking to him for a 10 or 15,
5305960	5307960	or sometimes 20 minute span.
5307960	5310960	He has every right to cater the show
5310960	5313960	to whatever he wants to get out of it.
5313960	5316960	I don't think there should never be a single person up here
5316960	5319960	who's bummed out to be up here.
5319960	5321960	I'm a little sad right now that he's not here,
5321960	5323960	only because I love Spencer.
5324960	5326960	And also his little table.
5326960	5328960	It's sad.
5328960	5330960	We have to on the fly.
5330960	5334960	Our show is dependent on Spencer as a closer.
5334960	5337960	So we're just as guilty as anybody.
5337960	5339960	I've got a feeling there's going to be some rapping.
5339960	5341960	Hey, let's call him.
5341960	5343960	Why don't we call him?
5343960	5346960	Call him, we'll put him on speakerphone,
5346960	5348960	and you have to be really quiet.
5348960	5349960	And we'll say,
5349960	5352960	Hey man, we just ended the show early,
5352960	5354960	and we just thought we missed you.
5354960	5357960	We just thought maybe you and I could just play some D&D.
5357960	5359960	My feeling was Aaron's here.
5359960	5361960	I'm just coming up with this now.
5361960	5364960	We bring up someone from the audience
5364960	5368960	that needs a problem resolved.
5368960	5371960	I'll sit at Spencer's table,
5371960	5374960	and I wouldn't call it dungeon mastering,
5374960	5377960	because there's no dungeon involved.
5377960	5381960	But we'll walk through helping them solve their problem.
5381960	5384960	Can I add a pitch to that?
5384960	5386960	You can replace that pitch.
5386960	5388960	It was a bad pitch.
5388960	5390960	We won't have the character sheets,
5390960	5391960	but we can remember enough,
5391960	5394960	because we don't really know our character sheets all that well anyway,
5394960	5396960	that you go over there and sit down.
5396960	5398960	I play the Spencer D&D intro music,
5398960	5403960	and you Ice-T Dungeon Master a little campaign here.
5403960	5405960	You can make up all the new characters.
5405960	5407960	We can pick a new character.
5407960	5409960	It could be a dream sequence.
5409960	5411960	Try your hand at Ice-T Dungeon Master,
5411960	5413960	or is that too heavy an impromptu?
5413960	5416960	It gives you the advantage that next time you talk to Spencer,
5416960	5418960	you can say, don't worry about it.
5418960	5421960	It went better than it's ever been.
5421960	5424960	Then maybe Spencer will be fine to come back.
5424960	5427960	I don't want to make a mockery of his domain.
5427960	5429960	I don't want to use your characters,
5429960	5431960	because we don't have the character sheets.
5431960	5433960	We can make up new characters.
5433960	5437960	The thing would be a shallow mockery of what Spencer does very well.
5437960	5440960	The first step is, who in the audience?
5440960	5442960	Somebody's already raised their hand.
5442960	5444960	Who's this young man?
5444960	5447960	Eric, do you want to come up here?
5447960	5452960	I was going to ask, who has herpes?
5452960	5454960	Eric, you can sit there.
5454960	5455960	I guess.
5455960	5456960	No, I'll sit there.
5456960	5458960	Eric, why don't you come sit up here so people can see you.
5458960	5459960	I'll sit down there.
5459960	5463960	They know what I look like.
5463960	5464960	How's it going?
5464960	5465960	Hello, Eric.
5466960	5469960	So I had a book signing here like an hour before Harmentown.
5469960	5470960	It was fun.
5470960	5471960	Nice.
5471960	5475960	So I think the first thing we should do is try to guess your problem.
5475960	5478960	I'm going to guess, lack of publicity.
5478960	5479960	You had a book signing?
5479960	5481960	I said, yeah, I wrote a comic book called Loki, Ragnarok and Roll.
5481960	5483960	Is this a cheap plug?
5483960	5484960	You came up here to chill?
5484960	5485960	No, no, no.
5485960	5486960	We're friends with Eric.
5486960	5487960	Eric was at my birthday party.
5487960	5488960	We're friends with Eric.
5488960	5490960	Well, the problem was that nobody came, really.
5490960	5493960	I had some friends from the show here at the game.
5494960	5495960	Now I'm sorry.
5495960	5496960	That was cold of me.
5496960	5497960	What's the name of the book?
5497960	5499960	It's called a Loki, Ragnarok and Roll.
5499960	5501960	It's a heavy metal Norse mythology thing.
5501960	5502960	That sounds great.
5502960	5503960	Thanks.
5503960	5505960	It's selling well.
5505960	5508960	It's doing well nationally, but it's a little bit jaded.
5508960	5510960	There's a lot of stuff to do on a Sunday.
5510960	5511960	It's a tough market, man.
5511960	5517960	When I was your age, I'm judging from the lack of pores in your skin that you're about
5517960	5518960	half my age.
5518960	5519960	I thought it worked on.
5519960	5521960	I worked in comic books.
5521960	5522960	Yes, it's got to make sense.
5522960	5524960	You know who would have bought one of those?
5524960	5525960	Spencer.
5525960	5527960	I actually bought one for him and put it on his chair.
5527960	5529960	The only day he's not here is that.
5529960	5532960	Guys, we're going to have to get through this without Spencer.
5532960	5534960	Stop bringing his name up.
5534960	5536960	It hurts too much.
5536960	5539960	All right, so you guys are going to have to invent new characters on the fly.
5539960	5542960	This is the adventure of, sorry, what was your name, Eric?
5542960	5543960	Eric, yeah.
5543960	5544960	Eric what?
5544960	5545960	Esquivel.
5545960	5546960	Eric Esquivel.
5546960	5547960	Dan, do you want to give us race or class?
5547960	5548960	Yeah, give us everything.
5548960	5551960	Dwarf, orc, human.
5551960	5552960	Nice.
5552960	5553960	Eric.
5553960	5556960	I'll be a dwarf fighter, let's say.
5556960	5557960	Okay, dwarf fighter.
5557960	5560960	Aaron, you're an orc cleric.
5560960	5563960	Mitch, you're a human.
5563960	5564960	I'd be human.
5564960	5566960	Maybe I work for the DWP or something.
5566960	5567960	Yeah, all right.
5567960	5570960	Human civil servant.
5570960	5573960	He's a half elf resources.
5573960	5574960	Yeah, all right.
5574960	5578960	You know, my salary just went up, obviously.
5578960	5580960	And Eric, you're just part of the story.
5580960	5582960	You're like, you're kind of objective.
5582960	5584960	We'll involve you in a second.
5584960	5586960	Okay.
5586960	5587960	How are you?
5587960	5589960	I used to use dungeon mastering.
5592960	5598960	Your intrepid party has been traveling for several days.
5598960	5602960	Across the lands of Galga 4.
5602960	5608960	You trod, hoping that no encounters will occur.
5608960	5612960	Finally, campfire after campfire.
5612960	5620960	You sleep in the sleep of the damned.
5620960	5626960	When you wake up, you're ready to go again.
5626960	5628960	And you do.
5629960	5634960	So you walk, and you come upon a comic book store.
5634960	5638960	It seems like there's nobody there.
5638960	5643960	You look around, and it confirms your suspicions.
5643960	5646960	There's nobody there.
5646960	5648960	It's empty.
5648960	5651960	It's not personal.
5651960	5653960	It's business.
5653960	5659960	So begins your adventure.
5659960	5665960	I'll start the combat, or whatever you choose to do.
5665960	5669960	Based on my role of initiatives,
5669960	5675960	this has been Ike's team introducing dungeons and dragons.
5675960	5676960	Nice.
5676960	5678960	Bitch.
5684960	5685960	All right.
5685960	5687960	I put it in Jeff's turn.
5687960	5689960	I approach the door to the comic book store.
5689960	5693960	You approach the door to the comic book store.
5693960	5695960	It seems to be locked with a device.
5695960	5701960	I take my great sword, and I try to jimmy the door open.
5701960	5702960	Now hold on.
5702960	5707960	You just approached Aaron's turn.
5707960	5709960	It's nothing personal.
5709960	5711960	It's just business.
5712960	5713960	That was a standard action.
5713960	5716960	That wasn't a full move action.
5720960	5722960	You were 10 feet from the door.
5722960	5723960	Mr. T, I'm sorry.
5723960	5725960	Mr. T, motherfucker!
5725960	5727960	What?
5727960	5729960	Mr. Ice T, Mr. Ice T.
5729960	5731960	All right, all right.
5731960	5733960	God damn.
5735960	5737960	It's not personal.
5737960	5741960	All right, Aaron, you observe Jeff going up to the door,
5741960	5744960	trying to unlock it.
5744960	5745960	It's my turn.
5745960	5746960	Yeah, it's your turn.
5746960	5752960	No, no, I was asking you what to do, what you want to do.
5752960	5757960	I detect magic on the door.
5757960	5762960	Waving your arms in a magical manner.
5762960	5766960	You sense that the door has an enchantment spell on it.
5766960	5769960	It could be some kind of magical glyph.
5769960	5772960	It could cause damage upon opening,
5772960	5774960	but you don't know what type.
5774960	5776960	Okay, Mitch.
5776960	5779960	Well, you know, I've got the DWP truck out front,
5779960	5784960	and, you know, I could just, really,
5784960	5787960	I could just say the city wants to come in and check the pipes,
5787960	5792960	because that's the kind of shit we do at the DWP.
5792960	5794960	We call that through the door?
5794960	5795960	Yeah.
5795960	5796960	To who?
5796960	5797960	To who?
5797960	5798960	You don't see anybody.
5798960	5799960	Well, I do see one guy out there.
5799960	5800960	You don't tell me who you see.
5800960	5802960	Sad looking guy.
5802960	5803960	I don't tell you that.
5803960	5805960	I tell you who you see.
5805960	5807960	It's the empty comic book store.
5807960	5809960	Yeah, yeah.
5809960	5810960	Well, it looks like a...
5810960	5811960	Do you want to roll a perception?
5811960	5813960	First thing I do is I turn to the cleric and I say,
5813960	5814960	what's going on here?
5814960	5817960	They sell them Loki comic books.
5819960	5820960	Then...
5820960	5822960	What's your perception?
5822960	5823960	My perception?
5823960	5825960	What I see through the crack?
5825960	5826960	Take a number between one and, like, 30.
5826960	5827960	No, just say a number.
5827960	5828960	Oh.
5828960	5830960	I perceive 12.
5835960	5839960	You see that there is a comic book store employee inside.
5839960	5841960	His name looks like his...
5841960	5843960	You can't tell a name from looking.
5843960	5844960	Yeah.
5846960	5847960	He catches your eye.
5847960	5849960	Yeah, he looks like his name is Buzz,
5849960	5850960	but I would have no way of knowing.
5850960	5853960	You see him and he looks at you and he's like,
5853960	5857960	okay, Eric, you're inside the store.
5857960	5859960	They're not with you.
5859960	5860960	You can't talk to them.
5860960	5862960	You can't see them.
5862960	5864960	You can't do shit.
5865960	5867960	It's nothing personal.
5867960	5869960	It's business.
5870960	5874960	I say to my ocelot companion, Chunky,
5874960	5875960	Chunky!
5875960	5877960	Chunky says, what?
5881960	5882960	I'll tell you what, Chunky.
5882960	5887960	Remember in the ice caverns of strumpled months?
5887960	5888960	Yeah.
5888960	5890960	When you climb through that small crevice
5890960	5893960	to find the key and unlock us out of that prison?
5893960	5894960	Yeah, cool.
5894960	5895960	Yeah.
5895960	5897960	I want you to climb through the mail slot
5897960	5899960	because you're perfect mail slot ocelot size
5899960	5901960	to climb in there and see if you can find some way
5901960	5903960	to undo this glyph.
5903960	5905960	What's your animal husbandry?
5906960	5909960	I'm a plus seven.
5910960	5913960	Chunky moves through the mail slot
5913960	5916960	with adeptness and precision.
5916960	5919960	You see his tail wag out of sight
5919960	5923960	as he disappears through the mail slot.
5925960	5928960	I put it in Aaron's turn.
5928960	5936960	Be mindful of your surroundings.
5939960	5942960	Aaron, what are you going to do?
5942960	5944960	I did better in that move of D&D
5944960	5948960	than I've done the entire time as my other character.
5948960	5951960	Why am I more invested in this new dwarf character?
5951960	5954960	Aaron, you observe this ferret go through the slot.
5954960	5955960	Ocelot Chunky.
5955960	5957960	Ocelot shit.
5958960	5965960	I use speak to animals.
5965960	5968960	And I speak to the ocelot
5968960	5970960	and ask him to let me in.
5972960	5974960	Okay, cool.
5974960	5976960	You speak to the ocelot.
5976960	5979960	The ocelot says I'm inside, so...
5981960	5983960	Let me in.
5984960	5986960	What's your...
5986960	5987960	A hundred.
5989960	5991960	One hundred.
5991960	5994960	I've been playing for forty-five years.
5995960	5998960	The ocelot, you hear scurrying and scampering
5998960	6000960	upside the door side.
6001960	6004960	Scampering of claws on aluminum.
6004960	6007960	It seems rodential, but you can't be sure.
6009960	6011960	But I know it's him, so...
6011960	6013960	You don't know shit.
6013960	6016960	All you know is you're outside a door.
6019960	6021960	That's not personal.
6021960	6024960	But because my intelligence is zero, I forgot that I...
6027960	6029960	Sorry, what?
6029960	6034960	So you telling me an ocelot went through the mail slot?
6035960	6037960	Damn.
6038960	6041960	You people can keep this city.
6042960	6044960	Shit.
6045960	6049960	You hear the scurrying after a brief bit of business.
6049960	6052960	Nothing personal.
6053960	6055960	A plaque in a latch,
6055960	6057960	and the door egresses,
6057960	6060960	opening wide its door-ness to your surroundings.
6060960	6062960	The door's open.
6063960	6066960	I call Chunky back to my shoulder where he's safe.
6066960	6069960	Hold on, it's Mitch's turn.
6070960	6074960	Mitch, you saw an ocelot go through a mail slot door open.
6074960	6076960	It was confusing.
6076960	6079960	I think I go in and I say,
6079960	6082960	guys, let's keep our eye on the goal
6082960	6085960	and not get sidetracked browsing,
6085960	6088960	flipping through, you know, buying Mr. Burns.
6088960	6089960	You always tell us what to do.
6089960	6090960	You always tell us what to do.
6090960	6092960	Yo, as soon as the door opens,
6092960	6095960	six ogres start shooting arrows.
6095960	6097960	What?
6097960	6098960	You didn't ask?
6098960	6101960	You didn't know.
6101960	6105960	All you know is six ogres in the non-fiction section.
6105960	6107960	Roll my invasion.
6107960	6112960	I'll roll your invasion when your arrows come at you.
6113960	6115960	I need you to all roll initiative.
6115960	6117960	I'll roll it for you.
6117960	6118960	Shit.
6118960	6121960	Oh, y'all got low initiative.
6121960	6124960	Ogres got high initiative.
6124960	6127960	Arrows coming from everywhere.
6127960	6129960	Three coming at Jeff.
6129960	6131960	Two at Aaron.
6131960	6133960	One at Mitch.
6133960	6135960	Of the three coming at Jeff,
6135960	6137960	one hits.
6137960	6139960	Six damage.
6139960	6141960	Fuck.
6141960	6144960	Aaron gets hit by one of her arrows.
6144960	6147960	The other arrow misses Mitch.
6147960	6151960	It flings off your shoulder like a flea on a brick.
6154960	6155960	Like a flea?
6155960	6156960	A flea?
6156960	6159960	Okay, you know like if a flea was on a dog
6159960	6162960	and the dog walked past a brick
6162960	6165960	and the flea took the calculated risk?
6165960	6167960	Shut up.
6167960	6170960	And the flea took a calculated risk
6170960	6173960	of trying to transfer itself.
6173960	6175960	Maybe it wasn't having luck
6175960	6179960	with the flea business on the dog.
6179960	6181960	So it jumps to the brick
6181960	6185960	and you can't tell a dog from a brick visually.
6185960	6188960	Jumps onto a brick.
6188960	6189960	Get no blood.
6189960	6191960	No dog blood.
6191960	6192960	Doesn't matter.
6192960	6194960	Sorry.
6194960	6197960	Well, since they seem to be kind of face blind,
6197960	6202960	I guess I try to convince them that we're Ogres too.
6203960	6207960	That's how you want to spend your turn?
6208960	6211960	Thinking about shit?
6213960	6216960	No, no, no.
6216960	6218960	I have fines against it.
6218960	6221960	I don't usually dip in,
6221960	6223960	but it's not a wise use of your turn.
6223960	6225960	Just because Mitch works for DWP,
6225960	6229960	he has a huge intimidation and bluff ability.
6229960	6230960	Yeah.
6230960	6231960	All right.
6231960	6232960	Well, you got...
6232960	6233960	That's how I got the job, the DWP.
6233960	6235960	What's your willpower?
6236960	6238960	I would...
6238960	6239960	Three?
6239960	6240960	Sixteen.
6240960	6241960	All right.
6241960	6242960	And you're doing what?
6242960	6245960	I'm convincing the Ogres there on our side.
6245960	6246960	You're saying what?
6246960	6247960	Tell me.
6247960	6248960	You got to make your case.
6248960	6252960	I'm saying, let's shoot Eric.
6253960	6254960	You don't...
6254960	6255960	No, I'm not saying that.
6255960	6256960	Who's Eric?
6256960	6257960	I'm not saying that.
6257960	6258960	I'm saying, hey guys,
6258960	6261960	we were just sent over from the main building
6261960	6262960	and they...
6262960	6263960	Are you guys Ogres?
6263960	6264960	Because we're Ogres.
6264960	6266960	And we're supposed to join you guys,
6266960	6267960	keeping people out.
6267960	6268960	What's your charisma?
6268960	6269960	What's each of your chorismas?
6269960	6270960	I want to know.
6270960	6271960	Jeffs?
6271960	6272960	I'm a 12.
6272960	6273960	Aaron?
6273960	6274960	100.
6274960	6275960	Mitch?
6275960	6276960	I'm up there.
6276960	6277960	I'm 26.
6277960	6278960	All right.
6278960	6279960	Hold on.
6279960	6280960	I got a lot of calculations to make.
6280960	6281960	Yeah.
6281960	6282960	All right.
6282960	6284960	The Ogres seem to agree.
6284960	6286960	They look at each other and they're like,
6286960	6289960	okay, they speak Ogresh.
6289960	6290960	Yeah.
6290960	6291960	Yeah.
6291960	6292960	And then they seem to relax.
6292960	6293960	Well, the lead one,
6293960	6296960	one who has plumes of feathers on his head,
6296960	6297960	and he's got...
6297960	6298960	Yeah, that's Gary.
6298960	6301960	Skull bones on his head.
6301960	6302960	That's Gary.
6302960	6303960	Gary.
6303960	6304960	He comes over.
6304960	6305960	With the feathers on his head?
6305960	6306960	Looks over at you.
6306960	6307960	Gary.
6307960	6308960	He knows you.
6308960	6309960	Okay, cool.
6309960	6310960	He says, come on in.
6310960	6311960	Come on in.
6311960	6312960	You're all Ogres?
6312960	6313960	Yeah.
6313960	6314960	Cool.
6314960	6315960	Come on in.
6315960	6316960	Come in.
6316960	6317960	We got to borrow some arrows.
6317960	6318960	All right.
6318960	6319960	He lets you come in.
6319960	6321960	He closes the door behind you.
6321960	6324960	He latches it with magic.
6324960	6327960	And the hobbits come out outside the door,
6327960	6329960	and they're trying to get in,
6329960	6330960	but they can't get in.
6330960	6331960	Yeah.
6331960	6332960	Well, we're close.
6332960	6336960	That just goes to emphasize the threshold you crossed.
6336960	6340960	Lesser heroes have failed.
6340960	6341960	Business.
6341960	6342960	All right.
6342960	6344960	You look around.
6344960	6347960	You see Eric sitting behind a table.
6347960	6348960	He's got his comic book.
6348960	6349960	It's called Loki.
6350960	6352960	It's got oonglots above the K.
6352960	6355960	Makes no sense.
6355960	6356960	It's metal, man.
6356960	6357960	It's metal.
6357960	6358960	It may be.
6358960	6361960	It's a misappropriation of an oonglots.
6361960	6366960	Of an ancient linguistic device.
6366960	6368960	You get the picture.
6368960	6372960	It seems like he wants you to think his comic is metal.
6372960	6377960	But oonglots above a consonant?
6377960	6380960	I don't know.
6380960	6382960	Still, he's sitting there.
6382960	6383960	He's got a stack of them.
6383960	6387960	He's got Sharpie pens, like paint color.
6387960	6389960	I go up to the Loki comic book,
6389960	6392960	and I do a perception check on it.
6392960	6394960	Or detect magic or something.
6394960	6398960	You see it's about 33 pages with ads.
6398960	6400960	There's splash pages.
6400960	6403960	The art looks good.
6403960	6406960	I don't know.
6406960	6412960	It's stylized, but still clean.
6412960	6413960	I look up from text to my mom,
6413960	6415960	telling her the sign is going really well.
6415960	6417960	And I wave.
6417960	6421960	The lettering is legible.
6421960	6430960	I say to Eric, we were told on our last mission
6430960	6435960	that there was a scribe who put secret magical codes
6435960	6437960	inside texts.
6437960	6439960	And we were sent in this direction.
6439960	6442960	Do you know anybody that hides secret magical messages
6442960	6444960	inside books?
6444960	6446960	He has no fans, two thumbs.
6446960	6447960	And he's right here.
6447960	6448960	That joke doesn't work at all.
6448960	6449960	Yes, it's just me.
6449960	6450960	No, for me.
6450960	6452960	I'm a dwarf with low intelligence.
6452960	6455960	I laugh as hard as I've ever laughed at.
6455960	6458960	He has two thumbs.
6458960	6460960	Because we all have two thumbs,
6460960	6461960	but he was pointed a little bit.
6461960	6462960	Jesus Christ.
6462960	6465960	I call my editor immediately and hand the phone to you.
6465960	6466960	Okay.
6466960	6468960	The two of you are watching this happen.
6468960	6473960	You think they might have ass-burgers.
6473960	6476960	We knew that was a risk when we came to a comic store.
6476960	6478960	What's your perception, Erin?
6478960	6480960	We know what my perception is.
6480960	6481960	100.
6481960	6482960	Yeah.
6482960	6485960	Okay, so you sense no one else does.
6485960	6489960	There's a green gas coming down from the vents.
6489960	6492960	It's coming down, like, slowly at first.
6492960	6495960	No one notices, but you notice.
6495960	6499960	Maybe Doug Benson's shooting a podcast upstairs.
6499960	6501960	Nice.
6501960	6505960	20 experience points.
6505960	6506960	That's good.
6506960	6511960	That's good podcast shit.
6511960	6514960	I like that.
6514960	6516960	That's cross-promotional.
6516960	6518960	That's business.
6518960	6519960	That's what I like.
6519960	6520960	I hate...
6520960	6523960	I just want to take a moment aside
6523960	6525960	to tell everybody that doesn't know,
6525960	6527960	I hate the personal.
6527960	6529960	I enjoy business.
6529960	6531960	Didn't you just recently incorporate?
6531960	6535960	I graduated with an MBA in business,
6535960	6537960	non-personal business.
6537960	6538960	Seems like it.
6538960	6541960	I loathe the personal.
6541960	6544960	And I applaud the business.
6544960	6546960	Is that what attracted you to show business?
6546960	6548960	Yeah, because it's a business.
6548960	6549960	Yeah.
6549960	6550960	Yeah, right.
6550960	6552960	It's not about personal show.
6552960	6554960	I examine my surroundings and look for staircases
6554960	6555960	that might lead up to...
6555960	6557960	Okay, we're back in the game.
6557960	6560960	Okay, I'll ring that bell.
6560960	6562960	Ring-a-ding-ding, motherfucker.
6562960	6563960	Okay, let's go.
6563960	6564960	That's the bell.
6564960	6565960	That's the bell.
6565960	6566960	That's his bell.
6566960	6567960	Sorry, I don't mean to take charge.
6567960	6569960	I look around for a way to get upstairs.
6569960	6571960	But I'm the dungeon master.
6571960	6572960	I understand.
6572960	6574960	You're doing a great job, Mr. T.
6574960	6576960	Jesus Christ, man.
6576960	6580960	Your character's gonna be fucking hanging from a thread,
6580960	6584960	you know, running around inside a fictional universe
6584960	6589960	I control, talking shit, precarious position.
6589960	6592960	I'm not saying you're Mr. T, like B.A. Barakas.
6592960	6593960	I'm saying I'm...
6593960	6595960	You're addressing me formally.
6595960	6596960	Yeah, I get it.
6596960	6597960	I get it.
6597960	6598960	But I see that probably...
6598960	6600960	You probably get a lot and don't like that.
6600960	6601960	Yeah, yeah.
6601960	6604960	Yeah, you ain't the first to tread in that territory.
6604960	6608960	Has anyone ever said that you sound a little bit like Vincent Price sometimes?
6608960	6611960	What's your move, man?
6611960	6613960	I look around for a way to get upstairs.
6613960	6617960	Are there stairs or some sort of way to get to where the gas is in your eyes around
6617960	6618960	in a visual manner?
6618960	6620960	You take in your surroundings.
6620960	6623960	You see that there are three flights of stairs.
6623960	6627960	One north, one south, and one east.
6627960	6630960	I send Chunky the Ocelot up the eastern one,
6630960	6632960	because he has great stuff.
6632960	6634960	Okay, you spend a turn looking shit.
6634960	6636960	Aaron?
6636960	6638960	Ocelot's at the ready, though.
6638960	6639960	He's at the ready.
6639960	6640960	Thank you, T.
6640960	6642960	Aaron?
6642960	6646960	Because I see the gas, I cast Painter's Mask.
6649960	6654960	And then I start running up the north stairs,
6654960	6659960	and I look back at Mitch, because we have that packed from so long ago.
6659960	6661960	Well, also we need to see each other.
6661960	6662960	I know, right?
6662960	6663960	Yeah.
6663960	6664960	How you guys?
6664960	6669960	You all need to understand turn-based combat.
6669960	6671960	You cast a spell.
6671960	6676960	As I understand it, Painter's Mask tastes one foot round
6676960	6682960	and has a manual component, meaning you wave your hands
6683960	6685960	in a physical component.
6685960	6687960	Painter's Mask, also known as magic chalk.
6687960	6692960	You have a lizard tail in your pouch that makes it possible to cast that spell.
6692960	6694960	So you do.
6694960	6697960	For all of you that are observing her, if anyone's looking,
6697960	6701960	what you see is a mystical astral painter's mask
6701960	6705960	appear over her face as she runs up the north stairway.
6705960	6709960	Now, she's trying to look back, but I need to check your agility,
6709960	6712960	and you're talking to other people while you're doing it.
6712960	6713960	Okay, let me look at my feet.
6713960	6716960	You trip and fall on the stairs.
6716960	6717960	Mitch, it's your turn.
6717960	6719960	The gas is still coming down.
6719960	6721960	The gas is coming down.
6721960	6724960	All the ogres are starting to look around at each other.
6724960	6727960	These might not be ogres.
6727960	6729960	That's a good point.
6729960	6730960	They're starting to look at each other.
6730960	6731960	That's good.
6731960	6735960	Mitch, her wits.
6735960	6737960	Well, I don't know that that's this guy's name.
6737960	6738960	This guy's name.
6738960	6741960	Well, I mean, he's working for the native music.
6741960	6743960	That flicks, motherfucker.
6743960	6750960	Well, we had a meeting about doing a spin-off very briefly.
6750960	6752960	Just called Order.
6752960	6754960	So I go up.
6754960	6757960	I go up the other, there's another staircase,
6757960	6759960	and I think you're going to like that.
6759960	6760960	I thought there were three.
6760960	6761960	There's three total.
6761960	6762960	Three total.
6762960	6763960	Yeah.
6764960	6770960	And I go up the third, and I use my special walkie-talkie
6770960	6772960	to call a guy named Chet McClintock.
6772960	6773960	Oh, shit.
6773960	6776960	Who creates a bridge, you guessed it,
6776960	6778960	from one stairway to another.
6778960	6779960	Nice.
6782960	6784960	All right.
6784960	6785960	I don't even call him directly.
6785960	6786960	I call him back.
6786960	6787960	It's a callback.
6790960	6791960	You call McClintock.
6791960	6792960	I call back.
6792960	6794960	The writer of Spooky Bridges.
6794960	6795960	Yeah.
6795960	6796960	Yeah.
6796960	6799960	He enters through the skylight.
6799960	6804960	But first, there's a rap by Robin Williams.
6807960	6808960	I can remember.
6808960	6809960	Otherwise, there can't be a bridge.
6809960	6810960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6810960	6813960	There's nothing to bridge if there's no rap.
6813960	6814960	Whoa.
6816960	6819960	I'm climbing up, and the trust seems windy.
6820960	6822960	Oh, I'd give anything to be back with Mindy.
6827960	6829960	What was the name of that bridge?
6830960	6831960	Patch Adams.
6831960	6832960	Patch Adams.
6834960	6839960	I tell you, I tell Aaron to go Adams.
6841960	6845960	But not in the style with the big red nose like Patch.
6845960	6846960	That didn't work.
6847960	6851960	A thousand spiders climb out of an eyeball
6851960	6855960	and spooky fire up your face and nostrils.
6855960	6858960	Skeletons come out of the dark coffins
6858960	6861960	and bats hang out their asses.
6861960	6866960	Climb up their assholes with rats and glasses.
6866960	6870960	Everybody's spooky with blood and guts.
6870960	6871960	Oh, shit.
6871960	6873960	I just bust a nut.
6874960	6875960	That's Hermitown, everybody.
6875960	6877960	Thank you for coming.
6878960	6880960	That wasn't a good ending.
6882960	6883960	It's not personal, Dan.
6884960	6886960	We need Spencer back.
6886960	6887960	We need Spencer.
6887960	6888960	Spencer, we miss you.
6889960	6891960	Let's hear it for Spencer, everybody.
6894960	6897960	Aaron McGathey, Mitch Herrwitz, Eric, Clint Loakey,
