0	10880	From downtown-ish, Los Angeles-ish, from MacArthur Park in the prestigious stabbing district,
10880	14880	Carmentown is now in session. Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden to the stage now.
14880	31520	So thin. So live. No, no. Only three episodes until you just absolutely evaporate and disappear.
31520	37600	That's what everybody wants. I love your little sexy desk. Well, you know what?
37600	40640	Just for good measure, let's bring out the mayor of Carmentown, Dan Herman.
44880	49520	Thank you.
59520	64240	The texts don't go out. Oh, rap, rap, rap. I'm gonna rap about this.
64240	73920	I'm gonna rap south and rap to the east. I'm gonna rap to your mama's titty. That's the feast
73920	79600	I love. Put some gravy on it. All right. You know our deal that we made?
81360	88320	If it's not going, if it's not working, we stop. I think you came out not really feeling the rap
88320	92560	like before it happened. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Here's some other things that came out
92560	99360	not feeling. Uh, humanity. Uh, like life. I don't care. You know, like I'm fine, but I don't,
99360	106560	yeah, I'm not, I'm not particularly connected to, uh, the brotherhood of man, uh, this week. I'm not
106560	118160	like rooting for anybody. Um, I'm uh... Rob Strava has taken the stage. He sat down.
118160	127200	They're staring at Dan. Rob Strava, an unheralded Rob Strava came out.
128080	132800	Hello, Rob. How you doing? Hi, Jeff. Are you, are you feeling humanity right now, Rob?
132800	137840	Am I feeling humanity? Yeah, Dan said he wasn't feeling humanity. Especially not the brotherhood
137840	142960	of humanity, which is good because that's a very dangerous cult. You should not worry about them.
143920	149200	Um, I don't think I am feeling the brotherhood of humanity. I'm being very isolated lately.
151440	154960	Well, it seems like Jeff didn't get what he was instigating. Jeff, do you want to try to
154960	160880	re-instigate something? Rob didn't respond to that. Do you want to try to... No, what I just
160880	165680	found out is that you guys both aren't feeling it right now. Oh. So that you guys are at simpatico.
165680	171120	Yeah. Well, uh, yeah. Uh, what do you, what do you, what's the worst thing that you saw this week
171120	178240	that made you think that, uh, the best thing you could do is hide from everyone? What was the,
178240	183040	the worst thing? Yeah. What's the thing? What's, what's, what's a, what's an event or something?
183040	188560	Well, I gotta tell you, this Kavanaugh shit is really bumming me out. I mean,
188560	196960	this is where we're at people. No, I was watching Vine compilations on YouTube and I got really
196960	202640	sad because... Because Vine's gone. Yeah. I like Vine. Vine was, Vine was fun. It was good. There
202640	209840	were some very, very, very funny things. And I know you and I had our disagreements as to when
209840	216480	and where it should be listened to and volume. Oh, yeah. You shouldn't play Vine in a fancy
216480	221040	restaurant. No, even if everyone in the room is enjoying it and... Everyone at the table,
221040	224080	everyone at the table. Everyone at the table. Obviously everyone at the restaurant can't enjoy
224080	229840	you playing a Vine. That's not, like maybe in a Vine commercial if, you know, like, oh, what's
229840	234800	going on over there? You know, like, like, it's like a Milton Bradley commercial for Vine, like,
234800	239120	where, oh, the chef comes out. I was trying to make food, but if someone's playing a Vine at top
239120	244720	volume, I'll stop making the food and, well, I was hungry, but I'd rather eat this Vine.
246400	250000	So what's the, what's the bur in your boot, Harmon? Like, is there anything in particular?
250000	254320	I think it was like, like, like I had a great week or a great... What are we talking... Yeah,
254320	257600	I was like, like, I guess we're going, like, since the last time I saw everybody.
259440	267360	Like, I, it's been great. What are you doing? You get a fart? No. Why'd you put the microphone
267360	274400	in your ass? What were you... No, you're talking. Why would I interrupt you? Please, continue.
275360	282000	It's just insane to me. What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. Why are you so against humanity?
283600	292160	What are you doing? I'm listening to my friend talk on his show. You're putting the microphone
292800	297280	under your ass. I would have to have something in the chamber to do that, and I'm,
297280	302240	and I'm telling you as a friend, I don't. Please continue with your story.
305360	310320	He's not saying you were farting into the mic, but we both heard you drag the microphone up the
310320	313920	butt. We all saw it with our eyes. I can't help that.
317440	323680	I think I had a... I don't know where I went sour. I think it was relatively recently. I can work
323680	329600	backwards from here and go, actually, I got really sour just now backstage because I was scrolling
329680	335440	through Instagram and I was... I follow Mark Hamill on Instagram and Mark Hamill... He's the best.
335440	340320	He should be on the show. We should have him on the show. I would love to have him on the show.
340320	345600	And he's unapologetically... Look, I don't think Mark Hamill is out there asking how am I driving
345600	351440	in terms of how he's handling being famous or what... Obviously, I would... Maybe I'm projecting
351440	357200	a lot to the guy, but it's like I see him as a guy who has passed a couple of return thresholds
357200	363360	into, yes, I'll say it, a return of a kind of Jedi where he's like, I got my robot hand and
363360	368240	I got my... I'm like, I don't fucking care. I'm throwing down my lightsaber, which to a lot of
368240	374080	people means picking one up, but fuck them. And he's like, yeah, I'm liberal and I fucking don't
374080	379280	like the president. And you're following Mark Hamill, not Luke Skywalker on fucking Instagram.
379280	384960	And it's just like, I got it. It's like a magnet. It's like negative stuff is sticky and you're like,
385440	392560	I want to look through his con... Because if I see Mark Hamill, he'll Instagram something that's
393760	404000	unapologetically left. It's like liberal. I don't like this Trump fellow. And then it'll say
404000	409920	6,000 comments. And I'm like, this probably isn't 6,000 people saying, and may the force also be with
409920	419760	you. I know what it's going to be and I just have to click on it. And I'm just like, I hate, I hate,
419760	427840	I hate everyone. I hate reality. I hate this fucking... It's just stupid, just dumb people.
428720	438560	Who cares? If you really... Is he doing the butt? He was. He was. He's putting the microphone
438560	443280	under his ass. No, I'm not. I'm not. I was... What are you lying? You're lying to people. What am I
443280	453040	lying? I was listening. There's 63 people out here that can see you sticking a link under your ass.
453040	457840	Oh yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you got busted. You're putting the mic on your butt and you're doing
457840	462640	a microphone butt wipe and he's talking about Mark Hamill. Okay, well, we'll never know.
462640	474000	That's not what we agreed to. It just made me grumpy. I scrolled through it and I'm just like,
474000	479120	it just toxifies. I'm just like, ah, God, people are fucking dumb. I just don't like... Totally.
479120	483840	I don't like people. But those aren't people. It's like looking at a fish tank at the zoo. You're
483840	489600	like, you're not seeing the fish. You're not seeing people, those are fish. It's like you're
489600	497680	seeing a sample of humanity that were driven to comment on an Instagram of a guy that played Luke
497680	503680	Skywalker and I don't know why I would choose to do that. What did you do? Did you successfully...
503680	508320	Did you fart? How do we know when you've done what you wanted to do? It depends how the fart sounds.
508320	513520	I think you think it's gonna sound like a fart and you think a fart is gonna be louder than you
513520	523680	continually sliding a microphone along fabric. It's gonna be... Spencer, are you on my side?
523680	532320	I'm on the world's side, but not humanity's side. Are there fish at the zoo or do you have to go to
532320	538080	the aquarium? Oh, so many fish. It's not a focus, but they're there. They don't stay because the
538160	543840	water keeps going through the bars. They have to keep refilling the cages.
546080	551360	They're still trying to figure that out. God damn it, why aren't these fish comfortable in
551360	557440	captivity? The monkeys are playing ball. What the fuck, fish? Every zookeeper keeps ordering
558240	562800	a cage on Amazon. The description with iPhone products is just like,
563760	572080	all animal, giraffes, hippos, fish, snakes, fits all models. In case you're searching for anything,
572080	576400	you type snake cage and they're like, here's a cage, works for snakes. You can fit a snake in there.
576400	587600	The snake comes out, bites you. I didn't say it worked. The aquarium house at the Milwaukee Public
587600	596560	Zoo was my favorite. Milwaukee had a relatively good zoo for the size of the city. The aquarium
596560	604480	house? I don't know. A fish house? I don't know. You said the aquarium house. They probably didn't
604480	613040	call it that. The aquarium, which probably includes a Latin suffix for house, right?
614000	617760	Yeah. Eum probably means house. Yeah, it's the aqua house. It's a water house.
618560	622560	Operarium. Opera house. You're describing an operarium.
622560	624480	Operarium, yeah. What?
628160	632000	I miss when Rob was using the microphone to make butt sounds.
634000	634880	It'll happen again.
635680	645600	So did you fart? No, you would have. I'm just asking. I'm getting comfortable. I'm enjoying
645600	649200	myself on the show. I think you're funnier and less comfortable chairs. I think
650080	656080	now that we've got you these comfy chairs, you're too relaxed. I think you're too sedate.
656080	660080	Talk about what you brought up before the show and you want to address that.
660240	663840	Your anxieties. Sure, yeah.
665040	669120	You feel like you've been listening to the show. You feel like you're bored with my own shit.
669120	674400	You're a little negative. Yeah, I feel like all I do is come out here and complain and
674400	680880	my voice gets to that register that nobody likes. And I feel like,
681520	685760	yeah, I'll switch it up a bit. So that's why I came out earlier.
685920	695040	Then that. Dude, you're misinterpreting that. That is not me. I was just stretching.
697600	702240	I love the idea that you sincerely were like, yeah, I'm tired of this shit. I'm going to change
702240	708000	it up. And you changing it up in your eyes is farting into the microphone. I didn't, though.
708800	710640	But you're like, as long as I'm not cranky.
710640	719760	No, no, no, like Nolan, Nolan, like I posted a picture of Tom Kenny and myself from back in the
719760	725600	comedy sports days. I think it was like nineteen ninety three one. No, it was before Scott.
728160	731920	Excuse me. Ninety one before Scott. Ninety one before Scott, you know, and it was a great day
731920	736880	because that was the day Tom Kenny gave me this amazing advice about comedy and writing and I
736880	740880	use it to this day. And it was great. And then like, no one comes up to me and he goes,
742000	746240	this is you? And I was like, yeah, do I look that much different? And he goes,
746240	750480	this guy's like smiling. He's got so much hope in his eyes. And I was like,
751520	755280	really? Is that what I'm projecting? And I guess I am. I'm projecting this
755280	760160	hopeless, depressed, sad, angry, pissy, pissy.
760160	766800	Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Well, I mean, I don't I don't want that to be me.
767840	776240	Well, don't you? I look like I would interpret that. I love that song. I would interpret that
776240	781600	as like Nolan's living in the Shire and he's like, oh, I love it when Gandalf comes to visit.
782240	788720	And if you asked the Shire to fill out a survey, don't you think it would come back on the Shire
788720	796240	news today? 90% of hobbits feel like Gandalf should should smile more. Well, of course,
796240	800400	they're gonna say that I feel like I'm always smiling. Well, no, I said, fuck how Gandalf
800400	805520	felt. I thought like, like, Gandalf is happy the way he is. But like, I'm saying it's like,
805520	810080	you don't want to go to the Shire for how you should be a wizard. Here's the thing.
810640	814960	Nolan was just saying, like, I can't believe you've become a life master. You have so much power.
814960	820400	You could turn a pine cone into a fireball. Right. And you you you you this guy that fights
820400	825600	a ball rock and says you shall not pass. It's crazy that you were once a kid. You made the dawn
825600	830880	come early. So the things turn into stone. I get it. I know. I'm pretty cool. Did he make it come
830880	835280	early? Was he doing that? I was like, that part of the book is he was like, he was just waiting.
835280	841200	He just like stalled them. And then the sun came up. Oh, I don't think he made the sun like move
841200	845440	faster because that would screw up everybody in China. They would be going, what the hell's going
845440	855280	on? Middle, middle China. Middle China. What? I just put the kids to bed. China. The kids are
855280	863600	going to school. And now I think I think he probably slowed time, slowed it. What? Or sped
863600	870960	it up, sped up. So you think he moved the sun? No, for the I think the perception of the let's
870960	875920	get this straight. We got to figure this out. I I truly believe that that story is that Gandalf
875920	880800	was just stalling them. He's like, you shouldn't eat them. You should hang out. And then he cracked
880800	887440	a rock that revealed the sun was maybe he did that. But my theory is that and Spencer. Yeah.
887440	891520	Don't go anywhere. What's he the Lord of? You know what I'm saying?
891520	902160	Uh, beards. The better title rings, the better title and the better title. And we don't have
902160	909040	to edit much. The better title. We don't have to edit much. Lords of the ring. Lords of the ring.
909040	916400	Right. Perfect. Okay. Okay. Send it out. We did it. We can leave. We fixed it and didn't have to
916400	921280	waste any ink because the other rings, even though you acknowledge that they exist.
921280	925920	They don't really play a prominent part. They don't do anything. It's like it should also be
925920	935600	called jaw. Well, I see both jaws and the two of them, but they both do seem like there's an upper
935600	942800	and lower jaw. Bad example. I thought I thought I had them for a second. They should call it Star
942800	951040	War. That's fair. Yes. They should. They should. Okay. All right. Okay. Episode one. Star is war.
953040	960800	There's one war. Star's war. They should call it. I like this exercise. They should call it
961760	969280	the horror at a specific house in Amityville. Right. Okay. Because who are we kidding? I bet
969280	975520	that place was a great place to have brunch. They should also call them mission possible.
977440	983680	All right. This is great. This is great. This guy keeps nailing it all the time. They should call
983680	993600	it meaningful woman. Oh, pretty woman. That's all right. Valuable woman. That was the story.
994400	999840	They should call it woman who shouldn't be in a, you know, like she means more than just human
999840	1007280	woman. They should call it human woman. They should call it human woman walking down the street,
1007280	1017040	human woman, Richard Gare like your feet. Her existence does not exclude non binary. You're
1017040	1021920	a foot guy. You're in the foot. You like the foot. Of course. They like feet.
1024560	1032080	I don't get it. That's the dead Harman foot stab. Great. So you like jerking off on feet. Okay.
1034000	1039200	Wait, do you jerk off on the feet? I don't know. Nine years from now, will that be terrible?
1040400	1048880	Probably. Okay. Well, then I better not. Feet have rights. You hate it. I'm just here doing a show
1048880	1057840	until I fucking die. Uh, yes. I like go on. What's your point about feet? Um, I'm happy for you. Okay.
1060560	1066080	No, no, no, no. Okay. So let's get back to the Hobbit thing. So they're trolls or goblins?
1066080	1075360	Hobbits. No, when, when they, when they turned to stone, they're trolls. They're
1075440	1082960	trolls because they might be ogres turns trolls to stone, right? Oh, I remember those being trolls.
1082960	1089600	Yeah. Yeah. Those are trolls. That was the hot. And they go, why did the sun come so soon? I wasn't
1089600	1096240	paying attention to it. I think what Gandalf did was he distracted him. He put a spell on him to
1096240	1103040	make them think that there was more time than they thought called power. Like he did like a
1103040	1111440	technique. What's teller would that be? Um, speed time. Mind fog. Mindful. Fascination. Okay.
1111440	1119120	Fascination. Fascination. Okay. All right. Uh, their feet turned to stone.
1119920	1125600	Their whole things. Oh, they're not just their feet. They should call it face on. Yeah.
1125600	1134480	Yeah. Face is on. Face is on. Oh yeah. Because they put faces on. Yeah. There's hardly any of
1134480	1142080	that movie spent with face off. No. Most of that movie is faces on. Okay. Okay. I hate to interrupt.
1142080	1147760	Wrong faces on. They should call it face swap. Face swap. I really hate to interrupt you. And
1147760	1151760	I mean that sincerely. I usually love interrupting you, but I hate interrupting you because I'm
1151760	1156160	turning over a new league. I hate interrupting you, so I'm going to interrupt you anyway. Okay.
1156160	1164560	Sure. Okay. Raiders of the Lost Ark. All right. Nazis go, we want to get the Ark of the Covenant
1164560	1175040	so we can win the war with the, because whoever owns the Ark wins the war. Okay. So the Ark of
1175040	1183200	the Covenant, a Jewish. Yeah. Let's get the box of Jew power. And like, does anybody go?
1184080	1193280	Okay. So we believe that this Jewish artifact is super powerful and it's got a direct link to Jesus
1193280	1201520	Christ. Not even Jesus. Fuckin' Yahweh. Yahweh. Yeah. Okay. Maybe we're on the wrong side. Yeah.
1201840	1208000	Maybe the Jews, who we're going to steal their death star in a box,
1209440	1217440	have got, are onto something. Yeah. Maybe they, they, we are admitting. It's just, it's just God.
1217440	1223360	He's not going to read the room when you open this thing. Like, whoa. There's one guy in that
1223360	1228960	movie that comes up to the guy, I'm uncomfortable with this Jewish ritual. And the guy's like,
1228960	1233920	yeah, whatever. Like, come on. We're going to, we're going to, this is going to be great. You're
1233920	1238480	uncomfortable with it because it's going to work really good and we're going to win the war because
1238480	1243840	of Jew magic. And you're, where's the magic? They should have called the movie Jew magic.
1247200	1252320	Yeah. But here's the, like, nobody wins. They should call every movie Jew magic.
1253040	1261680	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So we're, we're going out of our way. We've got a special task
1261680	1267520	force. We got one guy that's going to track down Marion. We've got the fucking, the thing that's
1267520	1271680	going to put it on the other thing and then we'll know where the thing is. And that thing is going
1271680	1278800	to make us win the war because it's super powerful because it's connected to God. Wait a minute. God,
1278800	1284240	the God. Yes. God. How? Because they're Jewish. The Hebrews are onto something. They're onto
1284240	1288000	something. What? Religion. They're religion. We don't have a religion. Maybe we should get a
1288000	1292400	religion. What are you crazy? Maybe we should just join forces with them. Then why are we doing this?
1292400	1296640	At the very least, stop killing them. Why are we killing everybody?
1300000	1303200	Hitler doesn't like that kind of talk. He just wants us to look at, look, we just got to feed
1303200	1310800	the beast. This is thousands of years ago. We did the biplane and then we did the Messerschmitt
1310800	1316880	and the apple pie kooken and stuff. What are we doing here? That's all we got. We got the kooken,
1316880	1324640	the tank and the Messerschmitt. They've got a box with Moses's bones in there that'll shoot a laser
1324640	1330880	and melt everybody. And we're saying that they're rat people and they should be destroyed. It doesn't
1330880	1336720	make any sense. What are we doing here? What's pointed at ourselves? Also, you can't put a rock
1336720	1342080	inside of a cannon on a tank and it blows the tank up, but it'll just shoot the rock out. Remember
1342080	1346080	when they put the fucking rock in there? Wait, who put a rock? Is that the third one? Somebody runs
1346080	1350480	alongside. Oh, that's you. That's the third one, right? Yeah. You fucking put the rock in there.
1350480	1358240	One more Indiana Jones, one more Raiders note. Bellock. Arg. What the fuck? Dr. Jones,
1358240	1364320	I am your shadow self. Oh, this watch. If you bury it, it becomes valuable. God doesn't exist.
1364320	1369600	I'm the shadow you cast with your atheism. I'm Bellock. I'm the evil version of you. I'm a
1369600	1375200	cautionary tale. I hold nothing sacred. I'm the guy that didn't give a fuck about the idol. I just
1375200	1379600	want to keep it. So I'm able to speak the language that the natives speak. And so you who were going
1379600	1384640	to put it in a museum have to run from them. How ironic. I'm the smarmy guy that knows the
1384640	1388960	shit, knows how to play the game, but I don't believe in God. Either do you. You're just an
1388960	1394240	academic. You work at a museum and then it's like they sit down and he's like, Hey, isn't it great?
1394240	1400160	We're both atheists. We both give two shits about people's culture and what the fuck. But Bellock is
1400160	1406000	the guy who's just like, I can't wait. And I don't care if Hitler Hitler can take a flying fuck. He
1406000	1411600	just emerges as this weird, like, he's like, fuck you guys. I believe in God. I'm going to put on
1411600	1416000	this Pope hat and I'm going to open this thing. And like the Nazis are like, um, I just thought of
1416000	1422160	this. He's like, go fuck yourself. Open it. Like, where did that, where was that Bellock when he was
1422160	1425600	closing the well, I was like, Hey, Bellock, you believe in God. Don't seal me in here. Fuck you.
1426960	1432560	He really thought, I mean, he put on the outfit there. They've got the cameras running. They're
1432560	1438240	like going, something's going to happen. What was Bellock hoping would happen? I know the Nazis hoped
1438320	1447680	that God's ghost would come out and go boo. And they'd go boo for Jews. And then God would be like,
1447680	1452720	Hey, you opened the box. I'm like a genie, genie rules. And they'd be like, good,
1453600	1460080	Heil Hitler. And the God would be like, Heil who? Okay, whatever you say, just give me more ghost
1460080	1466000	snacks. And it tracks with Nazis. They should have called the movie ghost snacks.
1466880	1473120	But Bellock was like, it's just weird that like, he's got the bazooka Indiana Jones. It's like,
1473120	1477680	I'm going to blow it up. And Bellock's like, go ahead, blow it up. You know, you want to open
1477680	1483200	this box as bad as I do. It's just, I, I never really got, I never really got that. But then
1483200	1487680	if you don't look at it, you're okay. Like that's so weird. Close your eyes. I looked this up.
1487680	1492880	That was a deleted scene. Seriously. There was like, there was a scene where it says like,
1492960	1498000	only, only like, if you look on this without blah, blah, blah, blah, there was something in there.
1499760	1505040	I vote undelete. Like I needed that. I was like, close your eyes. Yeah. Okay. I mean,
1505040	1509200	I granted nothing much else to do. He can't say break your ropes.
1510160	1512480	I don't know if it was a deleted scene, but it was in the script.
1513200	1519040	Now can I, can I say as because you haven't said it yet. Maybe if they fix it, they'll be famous.
1519600	1522080	Yeah, you can do that because I don't do that anymore.
1522080	1525360	Oh, you're, it's positive. Rob, the microphone farter.
1527440	1531200	I'm glad to get that stuff off my chest. I wonder how many of these kids even saw this movie about
1531200	1539920	this guy that raids a lost arc. You don't have to try to impress me. I don't need you. I'm not,
1539920	1544480	I'm not one of these people that's like, you know, I don't care. Pick any religion,
1544480	1552800	any religion, pick any religion, pick Judaism, something that we were raised in Lutheranism,
1552800	1559680	something we weren't raised. Oh, Catholicism. Jesus fucking Christ. There's a finite number
1559680	1568080	of religions. Shinto. Okay. Shinto. Okay. We're at war with the Shinto. Okay. All right. I hear
1568800	1577920	that they have a magic hat. Right. That if you put it on, it will, and it will kill everybody
1577920	1583920	because their religion is real. Because it has the power of the Shinto God. Right. Because they're,
1583920	1588960	their religion is real. They believe in a God. The people that we hate. That if you put this
1588960	1594080	hat on and you, and you look at somebody there, they'll melt and everything like that. So they
1594080	1598560	have it. They have it because yes, it's their religion and we don't like them. Well, why haven't
1598560	1606640	they won yet? I mean, we've been killing them for a while. It's lost. Oh, I'm thinking we find the
1606640	1613040	thing before they do before they do, put it on, put it on and then kill them with their own God.
1613040	1617600	Let me just back up. Okay. Sorry. Let me just back up. The reason we don't like them
1618320	1622400	is because of their faith. Yeah. I mean, it's gross. It's, it's, I, I have a lot of questions
1622400	1627120	about it. Ding dong. Oh, hello. Sorry. Guys have started interrupting. I've put an important
1627120	1634400	meeting. There's a, a very sexy archeologist who is, I think he might, he might have the
1634400	1639920	hat. Send him in. No, no, no, no. I'm saying the hat you're looking for, the magic Shinto hat.
1639920	1645840	I think there's a atheist archeologist who has your hat. He came here? No, no, no. He's got the
1645840	1651040	hat. Oh, you mean you found out about him. Okay. Well, Brian, I thought you were Amazon. No, what?
1651840	1658080	I'm waiting for a mouse. I'm saying, I look, you can be passive aggressive if you want. I'm saying,
1658080	1663520	I think, I think the guy absolutely actively aggressive. Brian, how about this? I'm telling
1663520	1669440	you that there's a, there's a atheist, uh, archeologist or archeologist that might have your
1669440	1676400	magic Shinto hat. Well, let's go. I'm sorry. I snapped it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I didn't
1676400	1680560	understand what you meant. I thought he was in the lobby. Thank you, Brian. And Brian,
1680560	1684560	hey, let me take you aside. Okay. Listen, I get, I know it's Christmas time and I heard about your
1684560	1691840	dad. Like I, it's not traditional to surprise, to not to tell people a bonus is coming, but like,
1692800	1697200	am I, am I Brian? Yeah, you're right. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to, I want to give you your
1697200	1701360	Christmas bonus early. I'm going to have Shirley write you a check, like, because it might help
1701360	1707040	with your dad's radiology. This seems like a trap. No way. Look, no, we're not Nazis to each other.
1710960	1718400	The whole point is to help. Okay. I know. Or tell on you if you're gay. I just, well,
1718400	1722480	okay. Well, let's, let's unpack that. Well, you're, you're not gay. Are you? Cause I'll put
1722480	1728960	you on a list and they'll turn you in. That's my job. Is it not? I'm gender. I'm gender fluid.
1729920	1732720	Oh boy.
1736400	1743360	Sorry. I had a little Tim Allen act right there. Nazi style. Okay. My third right got kind of
1743360	1748000	home improved down to, I'm going to put my two week notice and then quit. And also I don't give
1748000	1753040	a fuck about your magic hat. Also look, like you, you work for a company that thinks that
1753040	1759360	hats are magic and this whole thing is stupid. Brian, take a breath. You're incredibly important
1759360	1765600	to me. I won't turn you in. I will personally recognize behind closed doors, your gender
1765600	1772000	fluidity. If you never tell anyone that I did that. And what are you hiding? It seems like
1772000	1779120	I'm hiding my approval of you. That's a lot. That's me going for you in a Nazi empire. I'm
1779120	1784880	doing, I'm like practically a shindler here. Boss, you're so DL. It's like, it's not even like,
1784880	1793760	I'm DL. You're so DL. Download. Yeah. Everybody fucking knows. Everybody knows. I'm download.
1794800	1800720	You're download. You weird gender fluid Nazi. I already, I already quit. Like I said, you can't.
1800720	1807600	Okay. Well, good luck out there with telling everybody. I won't tell you where the archaeologist
1807680	1814240	is with your fucking magic. Oh, come on. Like he's hard to look up. So come on, Brian,
1814240	1819600	get it. Will you come in? See Brian. All right, Brian, I'll give you a raise. Huh? I'll give you
1819600	1825280	a raise. I'll forget what you said about gender fluidity. Why? It's really going to be a sticking
1825280	1830560	point with you. You're going to be the first gender. I never gave a shit about it. This is that
1830560	1835600	important. You're so, you're just so hung up on your own shit. You brought it up. Like you,
1835600	1839760	you played that at my doorstep. It's a fascist empire. Like I have to report you or I'm guilty
1839760	1845680	of like, look, how bad do you want this magic? How important is that to you? I'm telling you how
1845680	1850560	badly I'm telling you I'm willing to forget what you told me about yourself. I'm willing to pinch
1850560	1855840	the hose of honesty just enough to extend your career and your, your ascension through the
1855840	1860160	fascist ranks. Like that's, that's the best gift we can give each other. That's what, that's what
1860160	1865440	we do. This is what we do here in Nazi. We withhold, we withhold damaging information about
1865440	1869120	each other. That's what I could do. That's a high five. I could have told so many other people I
1869120	1873600	knew where the hat was. And you know, I come to you guys. Well, that's what I don't want you to do.
1873600	1877760	Obviously. Obviously. I'm coming clean. I'm laying a couple cards in the table. But yeah, because I,
1877760	1881280	now I have the leverage. I know where the hat is. I would like to know who this archeologist is.
1881280	1885840	Of course you would. I'm promising you as a Nazi. How about this? I would like to know,
1885840	1889840	I would like you to be honest with me for one minute and then I'll tell you anything you want
1890080	1895120	to know. Well, you've earned that. Okay. Do you want to pinch the hose of honesty?
1904640	1905920	Could you give us five minutes?
1909920	1911040	Brian, what does that mean?
1913600	1917280	That was a metaphor that you brought up when I thought that was, that you were being DL-ing.
1918000	1919120	DL? What does DL mean?
1920400	1921360	You're on the down low.
1922320	1923280	Oh, down low.
1923280	1924560	Yes, you're on the down low.
1924560	1925840	Yeah, being closeted.
1925840	1928400	All right. Oh, you think I'm DL?
1928400	1930320	Fucking everybody knows that.
1930320	1932800	Wait, you think I'm like, what? You think I'm a gay Nazi?
1932800	1933600	You're the most fucking down low.
1934800	1938720	Like there's such a thing as a gay Nazi. That's the call.
1943600	1946480	Sorry, sorry, sorry. I thought you guys were done.
1947920	1953760	I'm not saying you're a gay Nazi. I'm just saying like, you can be honest
1953760	1957920	about the fluidity of what's going on with you. All right, look.
1957920	1959840	This isn't about magic hats.
1959840	1963120	All we have to, everything is about magic hats.
1963120	1963600	Okay.
1963600	1967040	Yes, because if I find the magic hat, I'll be a fucking gay Nazi.
1967040	1968160	I can change the system from the inside.
1968160	1968800	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1974480	1976800	Just tell me you're a gay Nazi and I'll get you the hat.
1978240	1983440	I mean, I can't get you the hat. I can tell you where the sexy cis male
1984560	1987040	archaeologist who knows where the hat is.
1987040	1993520	You're going to have to fight a cis white male fucking archaeologist for this hat.
1993520	1996160	There's a fight them. The Americans are this close to flipping.
1996160	2000240	Like we'll find them. We just got to talk to them.
2000240	2002000	Look, we all hate Shinto people.
2004080	2005120	We're on a razor's edge here.
2005120	2006880	Tell me three things about Shinto.
2008240	2009600	They believe.
2010240	2011120	It doesn't matter.
2013120	2013760	Is that a chat?
2015600	2017520	Tell me three things about being gender fluid.
2018160	2019200	Well, I know.
2019200	2020160	Let me write it down.
2021200	2021760	Right?
2021760	2022160	Yeah.
2022160	2022560	Okay.
2022560	2023920	Well, what do you know about it?
2023920	2026640	Oh, it goes in my file. That's what you're doing.
2026640	2027520	Look, I'm just saying.
2027520	2028960	I'm a Nazi. That's what's important.
2028960	2034480	I think you want this magic hat so you get to be the biggest gay Nazi in the world and feel okay
2034480	2035920	about it, which is all right.
2036400	2038080	It's okay to be a gay Nazi.
2038080	2039680	I want to be the gayest.
2039680	2041120	I want to do right by.
2041120	2043760	Do you think Herman Garring is a straight Nazi?
2043760	2044480	He's a guy.
2044480	2046000	Look, he basically wears girls.
2046000	2046880	Don't even get me started.
2046880	2047760	See, right?
2047760	2048480	Shit. Fuck.
2048480	2049120	God damn it.
2051280	2052400	I was going like this.
2052400	2054880	He stole all of Gustav Klimt's art.
2054880	2056800	He stole Gustav Klimt's art.
2056800	2059200	He calls it, you know, like, like, uh, what's his word?
2059200	2060240	All right. Okay. Okay.
2060800	2062800	Like, look, wait, what do you want me to look?
2062880	2065360	Nobody does anything except for the microphones.
2065360	2068240	Like, look, okay, cone of silence between you and me.
2068240	2069120	We have an alliance.
2069120	2069440	Okay.
2070640	2071920	I have no horse in this race.
2071920	2076560	I is like, like, like, like, look, we're not going to change Nazism from the outside.
2076560	2079200	Like, let's you be a trans Nazi.
2079200	2080240	I'll be a gay Nazi.
2080240	2082240	We can't be out trans and fluid.
2083280	2083680	Okay.
2083680	2084000	I didn't.
2084000	2084400	I'm sorry.
2084400	2086160	I got the language wrong.
2086160	2088240	Like, what are you a trans Nazi Nazi?
2090640	2092000	Because I won't tolerate that.
2093040	2096080	I believe in freedom of speech.
2098880	2101280	Don't you dare try to refine my language.
2103760	2104080	Bitch.
2106080	2108480	Let's just keep each other's secrets.
2108480	2111120	Because otherwise, we don't do each other any good dead.
2111120	2114880	I just don't see the future in this relationship.
2114880	2116000	How about the future?
2116000	2117120	Hold on a second.
2117760	2121440	And if you listen at the door, I will fucking convince people you're Jewish.
2123760	2125360	I'll tell you our future, Brian.
2126400	2132160	Our future is we are the Nazis that deliver the magic hat to defeat the Shinto's.
2133280	2136320	And then after we do that, come on.
2136320	2138880	At the wrap party for World War II?
2141120	2143920	Guess what's okay now by the ice sculpture?
2143920	2146480	Like, oh, by the way, sometimes I harp.
2148880	2150480	And we fucking change it.
2150480	2152320	We change shit from the inside.
2152800	2154560	We're not going to change anything from outside.
2154560	2155040	Come on.
2155040	2156400	Just fucking sell out with me.
2156400	2157760	Make me this deal.
2157760	2158080	What?
2159920	2161360	Are the airplanes ready?
2162160	2162560	Fuck.
2162560	2163840	They just invented it.
2168800	2170320	They invented it 42 years ago.
2170320	2170880	I know.
2170880	2170960	I know.
2170960	2172240	This is a special airplane.
2172240	2172640	Okay.
2173760	2174800	It's pretty special.
2178800	2179840	I got to be honest with you.
2179840	2181040	I'm not super confident.
2181040	2185680	But if I give you the whereabouts of the magic hat, Shinto hat,
2185680	2187280	you're going to use this for the right reasons.
2189040	2192000	Maybe the cis white male guy should have that.
2192000	2192480	Oh, yeah.
2192480	2199200	You should go trust the one Nazi down the hall that doesn't share this shame with you.
2199200	2200400	You didn't share shit.
2201440	2204560	We have our fucking balls by the nut hair.
2206320	2210240	This is called a fucking friendship you can believe in, Nazi style.
2210320	2212480	We could each destroy each other.
2212480	2214000	Now let's move up together.
2214000	2216000	I pinky Nazi swear.
2216000	2219360	I will never tell anybody about your fluidity.
2219360	2221440	You never tell anybody I'm gay.
2221440	2225040	If you violate the pinky Nazi square, you realize what the consequences of that are.
2225680	2226640	Fucking A, man.
2228240	2228480	Yeah.
2229440	2230240	Of course I know.
2230960	2231200	What?
2233040	2235360	That's the most sacred oath of Nazi ever.
2236240	2236720	Yeah.
2236720	2238880	In other words, we have a thing that you can betray.
2238880	2239360	Okay.
2239760	2240080	Okay.
2240080	2240800	Pinky Nazi square.
2240800	2241680	Pinky Nazi square.
2241680	2242400	Pinky Nazi square.
2242400	2243120	All right.
2243120	2243920	And you're not going to...
2245680	2247440	It's a pinky...
2248320	2251280	If I violate this shit, if either of us violates this shit,
2251280	2252400	we're worse than a Nazi.
2252400	2254960	We're a fucking Nazi sellout.
2256720	2257360	And a coward.
2257360	2257840	Like we didn't...
2257840	2259440	What's wrong with being a Nazi?
2261520	2263840	Did I use that as a metric of madness?
2263840	2264080	Yes.
2265920	2268480	Well, look, in my defense...
2268640	2271440	Well, it's funny you say that.
2271440	2276160	I work for the Gestapo, and you just admitted that you're a self-shaming Nazi.
2276160	2278000	Brian, come on. Anyone can do that.
2278000	2279280	I work for the Gestapo.
2279920	2280960	Okay. All right.
2280960	2281680	Yeah. All right.
2281680	2282240	Come on.
2282240	2286720	I take off my lightweight tunic, and underneath it is a leather jacket.
2286720	2287920	But it's a Gestapo jacket.
2287920	2292160	I take off my lightweight tunic, and now I don't have my clothes on.
2292160	2296160	I take off my leather jacket, and now I'm nude.
2296400	2299280	I'm already nude, and I've been working out.
2299280	2305280	I take out a bottle of baby oil, and I start putting it on my thighs.
2305280	2306480	I fucking put...
2306480	2308000	It's just a second.
2308000	2309920	Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!
2310640	2312240	It's exactly what it looks like.
2313520	2315280	Until the airplane, it could just go...
2315280	2317280	No. Walter, get in here, Walter.
2317280	2317760	Okay.
2317760	2319440	I don't want to get in, Walter.
2319440	2320960	I don't want to get in, Walter.
2320960	2323120	Walter, get in here.
2323120	2324960	I will send you straight to fucking downtown.
2324960	2325840	I don't want to get in.
2325840	2326880	Walter?
2326880	2328400	Walter, if you walk away...
2328400	2331280	So help me, God, I may go down, but I will make sure you go down.
2331280	2332960	That's what she said.
2332960	2335360	And by she, I meant maybe he or they.
2335360	2337680	Walter, Walter, you fucking...
2338240	2339520	Walter, get in here.
2339520	2341440	You knocked, and then open the door.
2341440	2342960	You don't do that.
2342960	2344320	It defeats the purpose of the knock.
2345200	2346960	You fucking knock, knock, knock, open.
2346960	2347760	It doesn't matter.
2351440	2353040	Walter, you need to watch this.
2356000	2357520	So that you are culpable.
2358240	2360080	We all have something on each other now.
2363200	2364720	I'm holding you and kissing you.
2368320	2370880	And we're making Walter watch it, which is pretty bad.
2371760	2372560	We are Nazis.
2376240	2377280	All right, then we do it.
2377280	2377920	We're doing it.
2379920	2380720	Are we doing it?
2380720	2381760	Do you want it done?
2381760	2382400	No, no.
2382400	2383680	Three weeks later, we've been...
2383680	2384800	Three weeks!
2386320	2388560	Jesus Christ, someone give me water.
2389600	2392400	Oh my fucking God, I love this job.
2392400	2393120	We should...
2393120	2393840	You know something?
2394640	2395520	You convinced me.
2397280	2398480	You wear me down.
2398480	2399520	Hold my calls.
2400400	2401040	Unhold them.
2402160	2404160	No, I said hold my calls.
2406560	2407120	Three weeks.
2408560	2409200	Oh my God.
2409200	2411120	So it's an old Nazi gay joke.
2411120	2412000	Let's go...
2412000	2414800	Now, Brian, can we go see this guy?
2415440	2416560	Oh, guys, ding dong.
2418640	2419440	Deliver here.
2419440	2420080	I have a box.
2421440	2423920	Oh, this is a nice gift.
2424880	2426320	I would like you to open this up.
2426320	2427520	Oh, thank you, Brian.
2427520	2429920	Kind of looks a little bit like a hat box.
2429920	2431440	Thank you, Brian.
2431440	2433760	No spoilers, but it looks a little bit like a hat box.
2433760	2436240	Oh, Kyle Hitler, Brian.
2436240	2436880	Thank you.
2439200	2440240	What do we got in here?
2441920	2444640	Oh, Shinto hat.
2445360	2446720	Turn your eyes away.
2446720	2447840	Turn your eyes away.
2455200	2457120	Ghosts of my grandparents.
2461600	2463760	Playing my ribs like a xylophone.
2466720	2468160	Up my ass and out of my mouth.
2468160	2470320	The fucking spirits of death.
2470320	2473680	Oh, God, the fucking Old Testament wrath
2473680	2475040	of Shinto.
2475040	2475840	Oh my God.
2476640	2478000	Every nerve ending.
2478000	2481440	It burns with the fire of fucking evil.
2481440	2485920	Everything I was ever told by my unconscious is true.
2485920	2487760	I chose wrong.
2487760	2489040	I chose wrong.
2490320	2493680	I was fine being gay, but I shouldn't have put a Nazi.
2499360	2500480	They're telling me that.
2500480	2503120	The ghosts are saying, this isn't because you were gay.
2504640	2510240	It's important to people to clarify that after they see the whole world.
2510240	2511040	They're like, what?
2511040	2513120	You don't hurt anybody by being gay.
2513120	2515200	You hurt everyone by being a Nazi.
2525520	2527120	What do you think of that, Spencer?
2527120	2530240	I was trying to come up with rap lyrics.
2531200	2533840	I think a takeaway is that Shinto sounds pretty fucked up.
2535840	2536480	But it works.
2538640	2539920	I mean, it works.
2545520	2546400	Spencer?
2546400	2547120	Yeah.
2547120	2547840	Shinto thoughts?
2547840	2548320	What do you think?
2549520	2550560	Thumbs down on Shinto.
2550560	2552960	They really had it all figured out with that hat, huh?
2554320	2558000	There's really no need to argue once you have an artifact like that
2558000	2559680	from which to base a religion.
2560240	2564640	How do you think having that hat went south for the Shinto?
2564640	2565440	They lost it.
2568080	2569600	People were like, well, fuck you guys.
2569600	2570080	I'm sure.
2570080	2571600	I hope that person got fired.
2571600	2572560	Shinto doesn't have a hat.
2574160	2583040	Joseph Campbell went to a religious convention of all the world religions got together.
2583040	2584000	And it was in Japan.
2584800	2585920	I want to say Kyoto.
2586640	2589280	And what's up?
2589360	2590480	Rob farted again.
2592800	2594640	I think I heard it fart that time.
2597920	2599840	I might not have heard incorrectly.
2601040	2603200	This question is as rhetorical as you want it to be.
2603200	2604000	How old are you?
2605120	2605680	Yeah.
2605680	2606560	So, OK.
2606560	2607760	What are you doing?
2607760	2609200	I'm going to be 49.
2609200	2609760	All right.
2609760	2611120	What are you doing, man?
2611120	2613760	49 and you're taking a mic and you're going to fart in it.
2614800	2617840	Someone's got to clean that after the show.
2618000	2620000	They're like, oh, I guess he, you know.
2621600	2622400	Oh, and now he's got.
2623280	2623920	I'm sorry.
2623920	2624480	I'm sorry.
2625120	2626080	Oh, he's.
2627760	2629040	He has consumption.
2629040	2630160	That's adorable.
2630160	2632560	Sneezing looks enough like crying and he went with it.
2634880	2636800	He started sneezing and yeah.
2637520	2638320	Oh, look at him.
2638320	2641600	He's crying because he's holding in sneezes.
2644320	2646880	The thing is, Dan and Rob, no matter who died,
2646880	2648320	which of you dies first?
2648320	2649760	One of you is going to be the first person
2649760	2651280	to speak at the other person's.
2651280	2651760	No.
2653760	2654240	Yeah.
2659440	2661280	I'm just going to play the speechless card.
2661280	2662160	I'm going to be like, I can't.
2663280	2664080	Too important.
2664080	2665200	Too amazing a guy.
2665200	2666080	I got a thing.
2666080	2666720	No words.
2668880	2670080	And then people will be like, whoa,
2670080	2671360	Harmon always has words.
2673120	2676080	Do a little rift eulogy for each other right now.
2677040	2678160	I can't believe.
2678160	2679200	I can't believe he's gone.
2680880	2682000	Such an amazing guy.
2687120	2689200	And then I'm just going to pour booze on your body
2689200	2692400	and stumble out of the church and people will forgive me
2692400	2693360	because that's what I do.
2693360	2694640	I fucking get away with it.
2696800	2697680	I'll be like Jackie.
2697680	2700080	Oh, fucking like, oh, he's so grief stricken.
2700080	2700800	Look at his eyes.
2700800	2702480	I must be heartbroken.
2702480	2703520	People will be like, come on.
2703520	2704000	He's human.
2704000	2704720	He's a human being.
2704720	2705120	I'll be like.
2706240	2707520	Ashes to ashes.
2707520	2708720	Rust to rust.
2708720	2710560	Better to burn out than fade away.
2711680	2713680	And then I'll just like pull down my pants
2713680	2715120	and do somersaults out of the church.
2716400	2717520	It's going to be in a church, right?
2717520	2719360	You're not going to have like a vegan funeral.
2723600	2725600	Where they where they shoot arrows made out of.
2725600	2728160	It's funny because it's something that's important to me.
2729520	2730880	That's why it's funny.
2730880	2732000	That's why it's funny.
2732000	2736560	It's funny.
2736560	2738480	No, it's funny.
2738480	2740560	The idea of vegans as like Vikings
2740560	2742080	that they have like a special funeral.
2742080	2743680	It is legitimately funny.
2743680	2745040	I give myself an A plus.
2747440	2748640	I've reached a point in my career
2748640	2750320	where I got to be my own judge.
2751280	2752720	I can't rely on other people.
2753440	2756000	At least of all the targets of my aggression.
2756960	2759280	What do you think your eulogies?
2759280	2760560	Okay, let's say you're okay.
2760560	2761840	Harmon, you're dead.
2762160	2763280	You're in the box.
2763280	2765120	You're either in a church or not in a church
2765120	2766240	or wherever you want to be.
2766240	2768080	I think I want to do one of those like
2769760	2770160	one of those.
2770880	2772320	It's freaky to think about it,
2772320	2774800	but like, you know, like those things
2774800	2776960	where you're in a pod, you're underneath a tree.
2776960	2777520	Yeah, yeah.
2777520	2779440	Like those things like, you know,
2779440	2781680	it's like there's no like a biodegradable.
2781680	2783680	Yeah, and trees and flowers grow out of you.
2783680	2784880	It's like, think about it.
2784880	2787120	So we're standing over your future tree.
2787120	2789520	My shrub, my sapling.
2789600	2792640	We're standing over your organic mound.
2792640	2795120	The spray painted fluorescent orange axe
2795120	2796960	that marks where the tree should be coming out.
2799600	2803840	If there are people that you want to speak over your remains.
2803840	2804400	Brad Pitt.
2805520	2805920	In order.
2806720	2807360	Brad Pitt.
2807360	2808400	Okay, Brad Pitt starts.
2809440	2810480	Have you ever met Brad Pitt?
2810480	2811520	No, but alphabetical.
2812080	2813520	We'll disguise it as alphabetical.
2813520	2814000	Okay.
2814560	2815120	Brad Pitt.
2818720	2819680	Catherine Zeta Jones.
2824800	2825680	David Duchovny.
2827280	2830560	Ernest from the from the camp movies.
2830560	2831200	Now he's dead.
2834080	2834960	He's already dead.
2836400	2838400	So none of your friends are family so far.
2838400	2840400	You want famous people that you've never met.
2840400	2841840	I got to have to do the alphabetical thing.
2841840	2843120	I was going to go through the whole alphabet.
2843520	2844080	No, no, for real.
2845520	2846080	What do you mean?
2846080	2847200	I got to pick people.
2847200	2848320	Yeah, be real.
2848880	2851040	I wouldn't wish a funeral on anybody.
2851040	2853520	So like, who is what I'm going to do picks.
2853520	2854720	No, this is what I'm going to do.
2854720	2855520	This is what I'm going to do.
2855520	2858800	Okay, you're going to plant your body in the ground
2858800	2861600	with like tree seeds on your forehead, right?
2863760	2867520	What I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm going to sit there.
2868480	2872000	And with I'm going to I'm not going to say anything,
2872080	2874800	but I'm going to kneel down right where the tree is
2874800	2876880	up the bush or whatever is going to come out
2876880	2881200	with a fork and knife and some vegan salad dressing.
2881200	2881680	Okay.
2881680	2884240	And I'm going to wait for that tree to come out.
2884240	2885760	The damn tree.
2885760	2886400	Oh, no.
2887840	2891440	In front of your mom, in front of Cody, in front of.
2893280	2894000	That's amazing.
2894000	2894960	That's great.
2894960	2899200	Then you and then I'm going to get all that smart energy.
2899200	2900160	Yeah, you're going to be great.
2900240	2902400	You're going to be so successful and happy.
2902400	2903440	Big words.
2903440	2904880	Yeah, it's really me.
2904880	2906000	You're going to be so jazzed.
2906720	2908000	You know, it'd be cool to do.
2908000	2911120	I'm going to gain the ability to not return texts.
2911120	2913520	Yeah, I live forever.
2913520	2918000	Dan, let's say you just you got crushed by a falling piano tomorrow.
2918000	2919920	And your funeral happened that you didn't.
2919920	2922560	You didn't write up a like, right?
2922560	2923280	Dick first.
2923280	2925040	A pitch meaning of how you want.
2925040	2926320	Piano falls on your dick.
2927760	2929360	And you slowly die.
2929360	2933120	I'm pretty I'm pretty sure we don't need to like invent a sudden death
2933120	2937520	for me to not have met the deadline of writing up how I should be buried.
2937520	2940000	Let's say I'll probably put that project off.
2940000	2942480	Let's say your friends and family get up there.
2942480	2944000	Who do you expect would be first?
2944800	2946800	Probably invent Nicole Brown from.
2948800	2950080	It seems like she's a.
2954480	2955600	Because you guys are pretty tight.
2955600	2959840	Well, I just I just said, no, she's a she was a Christian person.
2959840	2961360	And she'd be like, Oh, God, Dan died.
2961360	2963600	And I'm like, Oh, you weren't joking.
2963600	2965120	You're saying that event gets up there first.
2965120	2968640	I think I think you can guarantee she seems the kind of person that would
2968640	2972560	that would be emotional, but be composed.
2972560	2974080	She always had higher hopes for me.
2974080	2975440	You know, she was a Christian woman.
2975440	2976240	I do.
2976240	2978240	Do you think Chevy gets in there at all or no?
2979520	2984800	I have a feeling like he'll he'll be otherwise disposed.
2985600	2990400	Do you think Rob will get up there and speak?
2991760	2992240	Me?
2992240	2998240	Look, you know, I mean, this is like you're I could stay on the outside of this of this
2998240	3003680	of this concept, which where I'm like doing bits or like, but I don't think those bits
3003680	3005360	will be funny because I'll be on the outside.
3005360	3008960	I think was the thing to do would be to like actually think about this.
3008960	3013280	But thinking about it is a little it is a little uncomfortable.
3013280	3016240	It's like like I don't mean necessarily like stop.
3016240	3017120	I reject this.
3017120	3018160	Let's not talk about it.
3018160	3024000	But I was like, like, gosh, I mean, what's your fear of like what somebody might say
3024000	3025440	like eulogizing you?
3025440	3031920	Oh, I don't I think that the I don't think I think if you can't come up with good stuff
3031920	3033520	to say about me after I'm dead.
3033520	3037520	Like, I think I feel like I've heard the worst of it through Google Autofill.
3037520	3042160	Like, like, I don't I don't I don't think Google Autofill is going to be at my funeral.
3042480	3046160	I feel like I think, you know, people will tweet like that would be so good.
3047280	3052560	It's just like Dan Harmon, Chevy, Dan Harmon, bad question.
3054240	3057040	Do you have a net worth and people are just crying.
3057040	3063600	I would like to think that that that if I can make it the 10 years necessary that like
3064480	3071680	that the only people at my my memorial would be just people that knew me, you know,
3071680	3074960	like, wouldn't it wouldn't be like a thing that people would comment on.
3074960	3080240	Like, I felt I felt pretty bad for as much as you can feel bad for a memory of someone.
3080240	3082240	I felt a little bad for Hugh Hefner.
3082240	3087120	I thought I thought it was a little awkward and sad that Hugh Hefner lived for so long
3087120	3091280	that if Hugh Hefner had died at 70 instead of 90, whatever he was,
3091920	3096000	that that he would have been like there would have been a 60 minutes like piece or whatever.
3096000	3099680	And it's like it says nothing to do with whether or not it was right or wrong.
3099680	3105680	It's just like the timing of it felt so sad to me that we were so awakened and stuff that Hugh
3105680	3108320	Hefner who we don't we don't know.
3108320	3113920	I mean, all we know is that like Brian Wilson or, you know, let's put Michael Jackson in there.
3113920	3114640	Like, I don't know.
3114640	3120960	It's like that people who do terrible things, people who do who who are so visible and so
3121760	3129120	like are effective that then like I don't did, you know, it was like the context of him dying was
3130160	3130800	it was like shit.
3130800	3134400	This is like like he really died at the exact wrong time.
3134400	3136640	Are you saying that you might agree?
3136640	3143520	I might I might die early just to make I'll be like sensing the Dow Jones of death value.
3143520	3145280	Like this would be a perfect time to die.
3147120	3151440	Are you worried that you that you might you might die under a shadow of?
3151440	3157440	No, no, no, no, I just what I'm saying is I don't think I think I'll be I'll be fine.
3157440	3162640	I don't think that I have to worry about what the world would say about a corpse.
3162640	3167680	Like, I will I think I could step outside and get hit by a bus.
3167680	3170400	But I believe it first.
3170400	3170640	What?
3172000	3173680	What is the bus?
3173680	3175440	Bus cross your deck in the day.
3176400	3177600	You're like what?
3177600	3178560	You're a grown man.
3180960	3183360	It's like, like, I don't know.
3183360	3186720	I'm pretty sure you're the reason why this topic is happening.
3186720	3191760	And like, you're just like, because I'm you're like, you know, you're like a fucking kitten,
3191760	3196320	you know, you you like you ever have a kitten and then like you could roll up a paper ball
3196320	3200640	and throw it and the kitten will just spend 20 minutes being so freaked out by the fucking
3200640	3201280	paper ball.
3201280	3202880	It's like running sideways.
3202880	3205040	It's so and you're like, that's adorable.
3205040	3208560	The kitten thinks that the paper ball needs to be attacked and stuff.
3208560	3211520	Like, this is you're like, hey, it's me.
3211520	3212880	I'm going to fart in the mic.
3212880	3216080	And I'm like, oh, I'm flexible enough that I'm like, oh,
3216080	3218800	that farting in the mic reminds me of death.
3218800	3220160	Let's talk about death.
3220160	3221920	And then you're like, blah, blah, blah.
3221920	3222960	What about me?
3223520	3224880	You haven't changed at all.
3225920	3231200	What what were you trying to accomplish when you were moving that mic in such a way?
3232640	3233920	You were going to fart in the mic.
3233920	3237280	Well, let's let's not let's not let's let him let's let him answer.
3237280	3238240	Let's try it.
3238240	3242960	I was adjusting the cushion with the mic with my hand.
3242960	3246000	And you want people to respect you and like you.
3247040	3248320	Those days are over with.
3250560	3256880	You know, it'd be funny, you guys, if when you died, you got a service, a skydiving service
3256880	3262000	to put your corpse in a parachute that has a time lapse so it triggers itself.
3262000	3265120	So your corpse just kind of like skydives just somewhere.
3265120	3267680	And so people are like, oh, it's a skydiver.
3267680	3270080	Oh, wait, he's coming into the city.
3270080	3271760	Oh, he's landing right here.
3272480	3275600	Oh, well, he's not getting out from under his parachute.
3276160	3277200	Oh, is he OK?
3277200	3278560	We got to help him.
3278560	3279840	He's dead.
3279840	3280880	Oh, no.
3280880	3282080	He's dead.
3282080	3283120	What happened?
3283120	3284080	And it's the fuckers.
3284080	3288480	This was my plan all along like in the end of the Super Bowl.
3288480	3288880	Like you would.
3288880	3291040	Yeah, it would be amazing.
3291040	3292080	It would be so good.
3292080	3294160	It would take so long to figure out.
3294160	3294640	Oh, yeah.
3294640	3295600	Yeah, sure.
3295600	3302080	If you can have a parachute canopy that like had like like you're a corpse, you're in the thing.
3302080	3302480	Yeah.
3302560	3308800	And you're going down and it's the Super Bowl or it's the champions like the soccer.
3310960	3311680	The soccer.
3311680	3312560	Or the football.
3312560	3313200	Winners.
3313200	3313760	Thingies.
3313760	3320560	And but a big game and you just the big but you have like servos and shit that fly you.
3321520	3323200	Just a dead guy lands right.
3323200	3323760	Yeah.
3323760	3324880	On the 50 yard line.
3324880	3325680	He's so good.
3326240	3326640	I guess.
3326640	3331200	But that's I mean, I guess I suggested that and then I take it back.
3331200	3332880	Like I think the parachute thing is amazing.
3332880	3339360	But then if you're like, oh, my final act is I want to I want to disrupt the like the Super Bowl.
3339360	3341440	Like then it's like, oh, yeah, I got an idea.
3341440	3342560	No wonder you're a corpse.
3342560	3346160	Like it wouldn't it wouldn't be it wouldn't be disrupting anybody.
3346160	3348800	It would be it would be like, oh, you're hacking the Super Bowl.
3348800	3352080	You figured out how to ruin like that.
3352080	3359840	One astronaut that jumped jumped off like a satellite and it was like an insane skydive.
3360720	3362880	Didn't you see that footage or whatever?
3362880	3366320	He jumped from the like the atmosphere and the skydive from.
3366320	3366800	Yeah.
3366800	3369120	And it was a parachute like whatever.
3369760	3370720	Here's what you do.
3370720	3371920	I like Spencer's idea.
3371920	3373280	He just didn't go high enough.
3373280	3373520	Okay.
3374720	3376400	Take the corpse up high.
3376400	3376800	Okay.
3376800	3377520	Super high.
3378320	3379760	Throw it out of the ship.
3379760	3380000	Right.
3380640	3381840	Let it go down.
3381840	3383280	Burns in the atmosphere.
3383280	3384880	You're a falling star.
3384880	3387840	So people can wish on you.
3387840	3389200	Somebody can make a wish on you.
3391440	3392800	But why did it have to be called?
3392800	3394240	Call Elon.
3394240	3399040	You better call Elon and say, hey, I got some ideas, Elon.
3399040	3400320	Hey, Elon.
3400320	3403040	Hey, don't rip off my idea.
3403040	3404720	That was my idea.
3404720	3406880	I'll sue you, Elon.
3406880	3409360	If you steal my idea.
3409360	3414080	Remember that time that Elon Musk sent a super cool red convertible sports car in
3414080	3416320	a space and then it turned out he was a douchebag.
3416320	3416960	I remember that time.
3417600	3419520	Talking about one of my best friends and I won't.
3420400	3422480	I think I saw his car recently.
3422480	3425600	Remember that time that I was driving my route,
3426320	3429520	my very circuitous route to get back home for the second time.
3429520	3435120	And my Tesla said, raising suspension based on location because I was in a neighborhood
3435120	3435760	with speed bumps.
3435760	3437360	And I was like, I love you too, Elon.
3438480	3440240	Fucking amazing car.
3440240	3441360	The man can do no wrong.
3441360	3442400	What does he smell like?
3442960	3443440	Apples.
3445120	3446400	The ultimate smell.
3447520	3450400	Smells like a bushel of South African apples.
3452320	3455680	Just more American than than the apples.
3456960	3457600	Can I be?
3457600	3458800	I thought you said owls.
3458800	3460720	He seems like an unsupportable asshole.
3460720	3461600	I got it.
3461600	3464000	Well, you you you go.
3464000	3465280	You go.
3465280	3466400	He's my best friend.
3466400	3470640	Can I just say that I think the Internet's mean to him.
3470640	3474720	And that's not to absolve him of any of anything that anyone has against him.
3474720	3478480	But it's hard when you're a weird guy in the first place.
3478480	3479680	It's hard to be visible.
3479680	3480560	Yeah, it's called.
3480560	3483920	And that's that's again, not to give him like too much credit or anything.
3483920	3486800	But I don't want to create the joke.
3486800	3488000	I don't think the Internet is being hard.
3488000	3491520	And I think the stock market is being harder than because he keeps fucking.
3491520	3497040	I think we could really be, you know, be be driving a man off the cliff because it's fun
3497040	3498000	on the Internet.
3498000	3498400	Right.
3498400	3498640	Yeah.
3498640	3504480	You really want to support a system that's like, oh, you're the new like car magnate.
3504560	3507760	And you made a completely green car.
3507760	3510480	And like, oh, you got high with Joe Rogan.
3510480	3513760	We should definitely like punish that until you kill yourself.
3513760	3519760	Like, I mean, like, I don't look like he seems like a dish canoe until further notice.
3521040	3523280	Until he does what he bench presses a nun.
3523280	3525280	Like, wait, wait, wait.
3525280	3529520	Well, my first rhetorical question is, what does he have to do to get anyone's approval?
3529520	3531440	And my second question is, go fuck yourself.
3531440	3534000	Like, like, like, like, like, who cares if he does that?
3534640	3536960	Like, I'm obviously biased.
3536960	3539520	I am I am I am in a healthy way.
3539520	3546000	Very toxified about the the like I need to move into my Gandalf, the white, the extremely
3546000	3552160	white privileged period where I'm like, yeah, I got to get over my approval addiction.
3552160	3556000	So that's tainting my my view of everything.
3556000	3562160	But in a healthy way, like I it makes me all the more like fucking rabidly like
3562800	3567200	human rights, like oriented, because I'm like, everyone should stop being fucking ashamed.
3567200	3569280	Like, everyone should stop shaming each other.
3569280	3572480	That includes everything that you think you're allowed to shame people for.
3573760	3575440	There shouldn't be any exceptions to that.
3575440	3580240	I'm tired of, you know, it's like, we've all been on a big roller coaster ride.
3580240	3586320	And for my money, I've been like, you know, I started here and I fucking do, but do, but do.
3586320	3590240	And I kind of like, you know, when I think back to the beginning of the podcast,
3590240	3595280	when I was like this boner that like, you know, was like, democracy doesn't matter.
3595280	3596480	And you shouldn't vote and all this stuff.
3596480	3599040	Like, I've changed in a lot of ways.
3599040	3600640	And I've changed back in a lot of ways.
3600640	3604320	Like the one thing that's come around full circle is I'm kind of like, fuck everybody.
3604320	3605680	Stop telling me to tie my shoes.
3605680	3606480	Go fuck yourself.
3606480	3607680	Like, I got to get out of here.
3609040	3616240	And and and I and I would never, ever, ever hurt a person that wanted to just be who they were.
3616240	3618560	Like, I don't I don't want anybody to feel pain.
3618960	3620480	You're still a boner, Dan.
3620480	3621040	I know.
3621040	3621840	That's what I'm saying.
3621840	3626800	Like, like, and if that's the new definition of boner, I'm like, good, because like, I spent
3626800	3631040	too much time in the deprivation tank of like, thinking that that could be the definition of a
3631040	3632160	good person because it can't.
3632720	3639120	If you are kind of like, across the board in favor of everybody being happy, sooner or later,
3639120	3644160	you're going to fuck you have to accept that that's going to piss a good 70% of people off.
3644160	3649360	And if you're not adult enough to handle 70% of people, like being pissed at you,
3649360	3654240	then you shouldn't be bandying about this concept, this, this supposed position you have,
3654240	3658800	like, like, you got to nut up, pardon the expression, because some people need to
3659360	3663520	some people that don't have nuts or want nuts, like guarding nutting up and like,
3663520	3666960	like teaching me lessons and being like, yeah, you're gonna fucking like it gets bad.
3667520	3672000	Like, you got to handle like, like this idea that you don't give a fuck what people think,
3672000	3678080	because that way, you can have self esteem and you'll inspire people to go, oh, yeah, etc.
3678080	3678480	All right.
3678480	3682480	What do you think percentage wise is your like, your, your, your, your Q rating?
3682480	3683760	Your global Q right now.
3683760	3686000	I don't know. There's 20 people out in the audience here,
3686000	3690400	they were willing to pay $10 on a Monday night. I think that's, that's a metric I'll use.
3692240	3695520	Like, like, 20 out of like,
3696320	3696960	8 billion.
3696960	3701200	Yeah, I don't say I mean, I was like, I'm incredibly biased. But I think like,
3701200	3711440	in 2018, I think that fame is a really, really like, it's, it's a dangerous thing.
3711440	3716720	I think that if you have no money, and you can become famous, like, that's a smart
3718400	3725280	parkour move, you could like, jump from, from zero fame and zero money up to fame and zero
3725280	3729920	money. And then with the right twisting and the right circumstances, you could leap from
3730480	3737680	fame, fame and no money to some money. And then my advice is grab that money,
3737680	3744480	hang on to that. And don't fucking use too much fame as your parkour point, because visibility
3744480	3750160	means you're, you're like, hanging out there. And it's fun right now. I'm not, I'm trying,
3750160	3756400	I'm not, I'm not, I don't want to be like, like, Aaron Sorkin and or, you know, like my predecessors
3756400	3762000	and be like, this internet, fuck you. I'm saying as a 45 year old dude, like spent like 30 years
3762000	3766640	being like, Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me. And I want to spend my life online. And I want
3766640	3770480	everybody to know what's going on with me. And no, no, no harm can come of that. If I just commit to
3770480	3776320	that and all this stuff. I'm just saying like, like, we've arrived at a world where, like,
3776320	3782880	there's so much fame to go around. And it's, it's so like, it's like, kind of like helium or some gas
3782880	3787600	that just sort of like, you can become, you can be famous for 30 minutes, you can be famous for
3787600	3793680	20 years, you can be, you can be this famous, that famous. It's like, like it, but it all has one
3793680	3800160	thing in common, which is that it's like, it's like, it's like the ratio of safety that it provides
3800160	3807760	to risk that it creates has gone way into if I was your broker, and I was like, don't buy fame,
3807760	3815520	I'd be like, sell, sell, because it'll make you it could destroy you more than it could help you.
3815520	3820880	Is there a ratio for you that like, that like, if you could achieve a certain amount of wealth
3820880	3831200	that you could retire on, divided by or multiplied by the love of strangers, like, like, how important
3831200	3835120	is that? It's not fame for you. I don't, I don't think you've ever wanted fame.
3835120	3841360	No, I did want fame, because I was like, I did, I was like, I was like, there's no question about
3841360	3847840	it. Like, I'm not, I'm not a victim of anything. Like, I absolutely engineered every day of my
3847840	3854240	life. I was like, how can I be visible? How can I make people know my name? Like, I branded myself,
3854240	3860800	I am every bit responsible for it's like every fucking ounce, I put nothing but energy into
3860800	3866800	the idea of people knowing who I am, knowing what I am, I, I will even go so far as to say,
3866800	3872320	like, I even like, added in these elements of like, oh, he's drunk, and he's cantankerous,
3872320	3876960	and he's like, oh, he's a tortured genius. And like, I wish that I could have controlled it every
3876960	3885760	fucking micro bit of it. But it's all ingredients that I aimed at a cauldron and set at a temperature
3885760	3893360	that I was like called fame or called called called attention or obsolescence insurance called,
3893920	3899440	called you can't if I'm if I'm a showrunner on an NBC sitcom, you can't fire me quietly.
3900000	3905040	Called like you can't like you I'm Colonel Sanders. So whether you like me or not,
3905040	3914000	my head's on a bucket. And like, like, and like, like, like, like, that's called tenure. That's
3914000	3922000	as close as we get. It's like, oh, you can't just be like, Colonel Sanders wasn't a colonel.
3924000	3931120	Yeah, and I'm not the whatever the fuck we thought I was. I am a guy that was like, hey, look at me.
3932000	3937120	Which is which is anybody that's like into me is like, yeah, that's why I like you. You're not you've
3937120	3943040	never pretended to be higher than us. But when you said that you want it, you want your name to be
3943040	3948240	indelible. And like, you want to be everlasting. Like, in that way, like, no matter whether they
3948240	3953440	liked you or not, you're not for legacy, just for tenure for for job security. But so it's job
3953440	3958240	security. But it's like, like Dick Wolf. Where's Dick Wolf? Dick Wolf is here tonight. We don't
3958240	3964320	know. Oh, we did. Dick Wolf. We don't. Is he alive? Is he dead? Is he in a Admiral Pike like thing,
3964320	3969440	like, Dick Wolf? Like, he's got 900 TV shows. His name's Dick Wolf. Like, you can like Tom Clancy.
3969440	3975360	Hey, Tom, stand up, Tom Clancy. Like, like, like, what is that? Is that what you want? Yes, yes,
3975360	3979680	yes. You want to be and could I also have a different name other than the thing? Like,
3979680	3985920	can I can I so that I can stop when I when I get on Google, can I stop being reminded that is it
3985920	3990480	important to you? And these are questions that I probably maybe knows the answer to because I've
3990480	3994640	known you for a long time, but maybe not. Maybe we never talk about this. Is it important to you
3994640	3999440	that to walk in the street and feel love or just attend or attention? I think that might have been
3999440	4004480	important to me at 32. No, it's not. It's not important anymore. I've gotten I've, I've, I've
4004480	4010080	gotten so much of that drink. Like, I love it. Like, it's so good. It was so nourishing. Wonderful.
4010080	4014400	When you talk about now, because you keep repeating that the idea that you want to retire and go away
4014400	4020240	and disappear. Do you think that you've achieved what you wanted out of that? Yes, yes. Because
4020640	4027680	you can't be 70 and be like, check the dailies. Did how did I do today? That's not what we want
4027680	4033120	from a 70. I don't see any version of you that when you're 70, that's not going to still want
4033120	4038720	to check your day. They have more faith in me. I mean, I don't think you should see a version of
4038720	4044640	me, but I do in my office. And what I was so amazing about watching you talk to Norman Lear,
4045200	4048960	who was maybe for me, the most intimidating guest we ever had in the show,
4048960	4058720	because he was well into his 80s, and he was fit and spry and groovy, and showed no signs of,
4059440	4063440	of wanting to not keep making television and stuff like that. Like, like he was just one of
4063440	4068960	those guys. But like you're saying I would like to just like retire now, but I can't see you. No,
4068960	4076080	but I retire from the, from the part from the visibility thing retire from the public from the
4076160	4080720	What does that mean now? How can you? Well, I don't know how can you I mean, like,
4080720	4088720	stop doing your podcast, stop, stop doing like, you know, like, I don't do interviews, I don't
4088720	4095840	want you know, like, it's, and you said you, you, you, you know, like, mused about talking about,
4095840	4099680	like, not doing harm intent anymore, which is fine with me there. I can't believe it's gone on as
4099680	4107040	long. Yeah, it's been a good run. But if you stop doing it, like, would you play Fallout 4?
4107040	4115040	Yeah, I would. And I say this with like, with like, with love and with all due respect, like,
4115040	4122000	I don't know a version of you that doesn't want to walk out on stage and find out that 63 strangers
4122000	4128720	are happy to see you. I'm sure I'm sure I would miss it. But it's also like, it's not unachievable,
4128720	4133760	like, when you stop doing it once a week as a regular thing that you, you know, have, it's,
4133760	4138240	it's, you could, it's Los Angeles, I guess if it's still worth anything, and you really missed it,
4138240	4145920	you can always go like, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna stand on stage next Wednesday,
4146880	4157840	and answer questions about writing. Please don't ask, can I have a job? I won't be able to give you
4157920	4164480	one. I fucked your mama so hard. I fucked her to the north. I fucked her in the mouth. I
4165440	4173040	fucked her to the west. I fucked her in, I forget the other directions. Oh, look, there's Rob.
4175040	4180160	Oh, he's, he's burning up in the, with his, with his jetpack. Now, wait, let me ask you a question
4180160	4185600	about that. The guy that did that, he didn't burn up in the atmosphere. You don't think like he,
4185600	4190720	his will to live stopped him from burning. Like, he wasn't like, and he had like,
4191840	4195840	you're saying just like, yeah, okay. So I don't know. It might not be, you're saying go to that
4195840	4201040	altitude, don't let corpse out and it'll burn, it'll burn up. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. But you
4201040	4204240	want to be unconscious for that part because that sounds like a nightmare. Oh yeah. I don't think
4204240	4210880	this is a method of euthanization. I think you're already dead. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
4210880	4217600	best suicide ever. What did I say? No, no. Best way around an insurance policy. You're like,
4217600	4220720	I'm an astronaut. Like no one's more alive than me. And they're like, all right,
4220720	4225440	we got to cover you, but you bet this better not be a suicide. No, I'm just visiting the atmosphere.
4226640	4232640	I'm going to colonize this atmosphere. Oh, it went wrong. My wife, my money. Why is,
4232640	4236640	why is your space suit look like Batman? Why does it have, why does it have
4236640	4242960	rice paper and firecrackers on it? Why do you have 5,000 GoPros around you?
4244240	4251600	Why did your corpse explode into Happy New Year, YOLO?
4254800	4259920	I support the trans community. Like, why, why were this all this like five messages? Like,
4259920	4265680	I just thought that would be a fun way to come back home. It'd be a lot of inside jokes that we
4265680	4269040	didn't get. It's just stuff. You gotta listen to my podcast. What were you going to say? Sorry,
4269040	4274080	kid. You get derailed. No, no, no. I was trying, I was trying to interject and I was interrupting.
4274080	4279520	Okay. Well, I was like saying, let's beat out like, like how, like I was going, well, this
4279520	4284080	isn't going to be very, it's going to be expensive because like, there's just be shut because people
4284080	4291200	are dying every second. Sorry, kids. Uh, that there's just be hauling like payloads of corpses
4291600	4296880	and throwing them at the earth. Oh yeah. We're not suggesting. Well, what I'm suggesting is maybe
4296880	4304400	it would be easier is if we shot them up in a cannon and then they fell down, but they,
4304400	4309840	so we would have to really pay. So we'll just be shooting dead people up into the sky to fall down
4310800	4318240	and then you could control it. Like, okay. Um, friends and family, do your funeral service.
4318240	4323280	We've got it locked in load. We're aiming for right. Uh, Portland. Right. Like you,
4323280	4328960	the more you pay, the more, the more precise the aiming gets. If you're a death row inmate,
4328960	4334320	we're just like, I don't know. We shot them up. What about if a government that like, like ours,
4334320	4339760	like in like several countries that can afford a space program, if your government approval rating
4339760	4346320	goes under like 30%, everybody gets shut up into space and we all get to watch them. And then the
4346320	4353760	night sky just to send like, like, like meteorites. We have a regular purge of Congress. Like we set,
4353760	4360800	we send them up every two years. We send all of the government up to a summit where we're like,
4360800	4367200	good luck. Better come back down with a functional budget. We'd love to bring you back down. We'd
4367200	4375760	love to be able to afford to bring you back down alive. Like time to earn that fucking
4375840	4380000	lifestyle. Or you're like, you have to wear your little outfits and like be a lawmaker and you
4380000	4385520	don't get parking tickets and they all go up like, okay. And they radio down to us. We're working on
4385520	4392240	it. Yeah. Not good enough. Uh, midnight's coming. And then, and then we're like, oh, here we go. And
4392240	4396240	everyone, like it's a win-win for the people. Cause you're just like, look, look, it's a new
4396240	4407360	beginning. It's raining sparkle people. Hallelujah. I mean, they were probably all 85. Like otherwise,
4407360	4411360	how did they end up lawmakers? Right? So they're like, just like, it's like, oh my God, they lived
4411360	4415520	longer than the poor, poor people that they are legislating. You know, like, they were just like,
4415520	4420160	oh, they sparkly now. They wouldn't want to live. It's like a Logan's run, but like healthy,
4420720	4425040	you know, it's not like you get killed at 30. You get, you know, it's like 85. That's a good run.
4425200	4429520	And your, your atoms get scattered into the universe and you, you know, like the iron in
4429520	4435280	your blood might like, or the amino acids might like start a new civilization somewhere. Yeah.
4435840	4442240	Oh, oh. Or they get, or they get totally, uh, how do you think space works?
4444800	4450880	I want to believe what you're pitching here. If I go up to a space station and they, and they just
4450880	4456320	drop me out of the space station, it's possible my, I'll start a new species. I mean, the, the
4456320	4461920	atoms in your body won't disappear. The, the law of conservation of energy and stuff like that.
4461920	4467840	You'll still, those atoms and things will still exist and be dispersed somewhere. Yeah. We will,
4467840	4471280	that goes for us too. We don't have to, you don't have to die in space. Yeah. But it's more fun
4471280	4475280	because it might go somewhere cool. Like, but that's the part where again, you're getting, no,
4475920	4481840	you're, you're like, I feel like you're mixing this, like, we all breathe Julius Caesar every
4481840	4486720	four breaths or whatever, you know, that stuff where it's like, Oh, every, every, every breath,
4487360	4491600	every breath has like one atom of Julius Caesar in it or whatever. And you're mixing that with
4491600	4495920	this idea of putting the senators up. They're all going to fall back to earth and they're just
4495920	4501120	dying. They're going to become a rock in Florida. That will be ignominious.
4501120	4506400	I just think we should take people that actually want to be, they're like, I got an idea. What if I
4506400	4512240	told everybody what to do? Hey, I think that's a great idea. I think here's the rules and we
4512240	4516160	should like make them brutal. You know, speaking of rules, why don't we play some D&D for once in a
4516160	4525040	while, man? You want to play some D&D? Damn. You got the good Spencer? We need Levi, right? Yeah.
4525120	4527760	Let's bring up a Levi.
4536640	4542720	Oh, Jesus. There's a thug on stage. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa. I didn't know what
4542720	4549200	neighborhood we moved in. Who's this thug? Eating some potatoes backstage. Weren't you eating
4549200	4556480	potatoes? No. Who are you eating? Plantains. Plantain. Oh, they did look like potatoes. Yeah,
4556480	4564000	the banana of potatoes. Plantains are the bananas of potatoes. Why do you kids wear these hoods? You
4564000	4567120	want to look like a thug? You don't have to take it off. Just explain your culture. Tell me like
4567120	4573120	grandmother. I don't know. It's cold. All right. But don't you worry about the peripheral vision?
4573120	4578480	I find when I wear a hood, like, which I haven't done since I lived in Milwaukee because it was
4578480	4583440	cold, that I'm like, I can't see on either side of me. It's like how you train a hawk.
4583440	4588240	Were you having a bad hair day or like, what's why the hood? No, it was just cold backstage.
4588240	4592080	Okay. I like wearing a hood. I like my ears covered. You don't have bad hair days. Your
4592080	4596800	hair seems very consistent. Yeah, you're like, yeah, Cody said this about me. So I'm shit rolls
4596800	4603920	downhill. You're like a Lego. Okay, I'll take it. I love Lego. Steve has had bad hair days. Yeah,
4604240	4610000	you're like a piece of Danish plastic. What the fuck? Why don't you bring up more bad? Oh, shit.
4611040	4613920	Fucking shit. Oh, right. Because Schwab did the Legos.
4614960	4619280	Cody had a, she started calling me a Lego because I got my last haircut. It was like nice and clean
4619280	4622960	back here. And she showed, I was like, come on. She just doesn't, she's just looking at the nape
4622960	4627600	of my neck and she's not like, it's a haircut. But then she showed me a photo of the back of a Lego
4627600	4633040	and it was like, I see what she's doing. And then I, are you ever been so in love that you're like,
4633680	4637760	you like being teased? Like you like, you're like, I like it when she calls me a Lego.
4639440	4643200	Never. Have you ever had a love that deep? You fucking married fuck.
4646000	4648000	Did we lose Jeff's character sheet?
4650640	4652880	That's the one that holds the character sheets.
4655760	4661360	Does that mean we lost Jeff's character sheet? No, he's got it. Well, then everything's going
4661360	4671200	according to plan. Sorry. What, what was the confusion? Nevermind. There was an extra folder
4671200	4675840	that we didn't know. Yeah, yeah. It's the folder that holds the folder. Gary Shambling's folder
4675840	4680320	is not clearly marked. So we didn't know which was which. It's clearly marked as the one that's not
4680320	4686160	marked. Anybody playing this Spiderman game, this new Spiderman game? Oh yeah. I haven't played it
4686320	4693520	yet. Is it only a platform? It's not on Steam. No, no Steam PS4. I heard it's good. You know,
4693520	4696960	it's not like, like if you were going to detract, detract it, then it would be like, oh, it's a,
4696960	4702400	it's a Arkham city, but Spiderman, but that's not, that's, that's good. Like,
4702400	4707840	it's also Batman. It's also shadow, shadow of Mordor. I fucking love it. It's like, it's like,
4707840	4711520	yeah, there's like game engine where it's like, oh, hold this button down and you can see shit.
4712320	4716320	But when that, there was that one Spiderman game, it's like, that's all I've ever wanted is like,
4716320	4722880	yeah, give me some Grand Theft Auto, but I'm Spiderman, which is like, yeah. That's all I,
4722880	4728880	that's all anybody's ever wanted. I want to, I want to sling some, some webs.
4728880	4738160	I'm bringing back, um, sexy friends. Uh, we got David, the company and, uh,
4739760	4747360	that could be big. Hey, uh, hey, I have a question for, uh, Rob Schwab and Steve Levy,
4747360	4753280	Dan Harmon. And what's your name? Spencer Crittenden. Uh, we can, it seems like an edit point.
4754000	4756480	Yeah, it kind of feels like it. Would you guys like to play some
4756480	4765200	totally uneditable, uh, D&D? Yeah, man. I did enjoy all those ads we just heard.
4767760	4772880	Well, what happened last time? You guys, you found the bluest apron ever.
4774560	4780240	The other place capable of conjuring great meals that you prepare. You want to expand your
4780240	4784960	investment portfolio, but you don't want to do it. Not on your cell phones. Zap to it,
4784960	4789760	recruit it. It's here to be a reverse LinkedIn for you. Oh man.
4791680	4798160	Okay. So no, you guys left the town. You got reassigned. You were reassigned from the town.
4798160	4805920	You were looking for patches just on your own time and you got reassigned. You got sent on your way
4805920	4811360	to this new place where shit was going down. It was a mining town and the mining town was like
4811360	4818160	going on strike. You were there to like investigate, clear up the log jams, you know, as you are want
4818160	4825840	to do. And on your way, there was demons. Oh boy. Well, I guess it was, there was cults. You
4825840	4830880	found a cult, you found a different cult, you helped the different cult summon a demon.
4831840	4838400	The demon was summoned and you continued to help summon the demon. And then you kind of fought at
4838400	4847280	the demon a little bit. Ineffectually, the demon was strong, maybe even very incredibly strong,
4847280	4855040	but that's the situation you found yourself in. What will happen? Who will live? Who will not?
4857600	4864560	Wait, didn't we? It makes you think like, what if, what if, what if the reason the world is the
4864560	4871120	way it is right now is because God is dungeon master and he's given up. And he's just like,
4871120	4878880	you guys are in a cave. Tell me what you want. I'll tell you who I'll tell you. We want to sneak
4878880	4882640	and he's like, yeah, to what's your agility? And we're like, we don't know. He's like, fuck you.
4884000	4888560	Call me when you can keep a planet. Hey, Carlos, why don't you put a sock in it? Because I'll tell
4888560	4895600	you, I'll tell you who hasn't given up. Oh, giving up Chad, the fireliker before. Hey, look,
4895600	4902160	you know, I hate it. I know when I'm not wanted. I got to go back home. I got to let my dog out.
4902160	4906880	This is bullshit. You guys were all talking shit about me. I can never do anything right.
4906880	4914240	Fuck off. Take this and this and you keep these stupid things. Goodbye. Stay, stay, stay.
4914240	4921680	Oh my God. I love that. He's pretending his character is leaving. Stay. My character is
4921680	4935920	saying stay. My character wants your character to not leave. Stay. Please stay. I want my,
4936320	4946960	my character is nicer. Okay. Like I, I do what's the, what's necessary to make him stay.
4950000	4956800	16, which pretty accurate. It's not bad. It's not really a metaphor. It's like,
4956800	4962960	that's exactly my charisma. But I'm a plant person. Right. But I'm an inclusive 16 supposed
4962960	4970400	to talk to plants. I'm, I can talk to anybody. Stay. I'm, I'm with the church of the silver
4970400	4974960	flame. Stay. What are you doing? Isn't there a demon about to kill us? Yeah. Damn it.
4977920	4985520	Oh my God. I, I try to focus on the, the, uh, the inherent peril going on right now. And I, I
4985520	4989920	examine the surroundings, what's going on around. So I don't know what Steve was doing last, but
4989920	4995360	shrub walking away and leaving the circle is like making the circle, which has been distorted and
4995360	5000160	messed up, kind of tightened more around the demon. He's kind of half in and half out of it.
5000160	5005440	So it's kind of holding him fast and he was like, Oh no, this is bad. But being like a 25 foot tall
5005440	5010400	demon, he can still lash out and attack and stuff. So it's not a solved problem. Wait. So him walking
5010400	5017360	away, Gary Shambling walking away is that that's making it harder for the demon. Yeah. Because
5017360	5022480	Steven, uh, Rob helped summon the demon. They were one of like about the seven to eight people
5022480	5027360	that stood in the summoning circle to summon the demon. So when they left their places,
5027360	5034640	it had an effect on the ritual is what you're cleaning Gary and, uh, diarrhea junior walk away
5034640	5039040	from each other and it'll, it'll make it harder for the demon to move. Well, that's happened at
5039040	5045200	this point that has occurred. All right. I walk away. You guys think our alcoholism is your
5045200	5049280	sandbox. That's what you just think you could just do whatever you want during my blackouts.
5050320	5055120	Well, you can't, I mean, you can, but then I will during the next blackout, hear about it.
5055680	5062480	And then I'll be like, what the fuck do we know about how many, uh, HP, the, uh, the, uh, the
5062480	5068240	demon has right now. It looks like it has all of it. All of it. How much of its body is through
5068240	5073840	the circle? About half, but like a diagonal half, but mostly the upper. All right. Well,
5073840	5079760	I'm like, I'm walking away. I'm like, that was a mistake. You didn't help some of the demons. So
5079760	5084880	I wasn't helping anyway. So it doesn't change it, but you are, you're farther away from it,
5084880	5092560	which is good because it's, it has a long reach, you know? Yeah. Are we in combat like turn mode
5092560	5101760	right now? Technically, technically we always are. I mean, whose turn is it? How about it's yours?
5101760	5108720	All right. Well, then how about this? I summon nature's ally and I summon a giant ant. Okay.
5113840	5119920	His name is Cornelius. Uh, he's a, uh, he's a fire ant. He, uh, he, he, he,
5119920	5124320	cause I'm a fire elemental kind of fair. I don't think you're supposed to see if the
5124720	5131520	he's, he's a fiery ant and, uh, and he has some of my fire elemental power. Let's have a shower
5132080	5137200	for him. Then let's find out if you summon why you, why, why are you shaming my, my,
5137200	5142560	you know, I'm saying like, it's not healthy. Like wait to see. Oh, no, you can summon. That's fine.
5142560	5146960	The summit just happened. Cornelius. Yay. Cornelius. You were doubting my ability to
5146960	5152960	summon nature's ally. Fire ants don't use real fire. Yeah, but, but, but because I'm a fire,
5152960	5158800	because I'm a fire like, or he, he's a fire ant. He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a real pain in the butt.
5159840	5165120	He also likes spicy food. He loves, yeah. He, uh, he loves fur.
5168080	5176480	He's some people call him a fur ant. That's stupid. Okay. So, uh, hello, Cornelius.
5177440	5186080	Attack. All right. It goes, it rushes. It's in a rage. Yeah. Oh boy. If I know Cornelius,
5186080	5192640	he's fucking in a full on range. Cornelius don't fucking play being summoned from, uh,
5193280	5200160	another plane. It makes them all crazy and such. There's just a plane of ants. There's a whole,
5200160	5205280	yeah, there's a plane for every monster. It's really fucked up. These planes on these planes,
5205280	5209040	are they like the dominant life form? Are these planes like functional,
5209040	5212880	like the material plane, or are they just planes where there's like ghost ants? Like,
5212880	5217840	like, I always imagine it just being like swirling monsters in space,
5217840	5221040	but it probably is something more logical. I would have, I would have summoned a snake
5221040	5231600	from a plane, but, uh, it's not on my sheet. All right. The, the ant bites him. It doesn't seem
5231680	5236720	like it hurts very bad. It bites him for three damage. Three is fucking better than no. It's,
5236720	5246080	it does look like it's better than no damage by a thin margin. Cornelius, uh, relocate. He re he,
5246080	5251680	he makes as to relocate because Cornelius is a rogue ant and he likes to do sneak attacks.
5252240	5257920	How many turns does this guy get? Well, he's just like, I go to college. I use,
5258880	5264240	but pretend, pretend to be a cop so that my role as a kingpin can be bolstered.
5264240	5268640	I use my turn. I summoned an ant, did three damage. What have you done for me lately?
5268640	5273360	I can't do anything. You get the departed ruling out here. You've got like all your 90
5273360	5278960	moves like happening. That was my joke. You should go. Uh, I would like to wait.
5281760	5285920	Wait, what? I'd like to wait and see what happens. Wait, wait, wait for what,
5286000	5288720	for your awesome jokes to land and hurting my feelings.
5288720	5293920	Now hurting your feelings. Why do you, you're, you're a fucking macho guy with attack. Did I,
5293920	5300800	well, I don't, the demon, I didn't think it was a mistake. I'm stepping back and I'm, I'm like,
5301360	5306800	we shouldn't have done this. I don't remember doing it. Yeah. You didn't actually, you, you,
5306800	5311760	they did it, but I'll be frank and say, I don't remember not doing it. Sure. So we should, I
5311760	5317120	should cop to my, but you're saying that you're wasting a turn on not doing anything. Well,
5317120	5320720	I want to be a participant and go like, look, while this is happening, I want to do everything
5320720	5325760	I can to make sure you're saying I pass. Okay. I gotcha. Yeah. I think it would, it would be
5325760	5330960	helpful if during this, like, it'd be helpful if the toughest guy in our group didn't do shit
5330960	5336880	during, uh, during this fight. I think Rob's the toughest guy. I thought you were. I mean,
5337120	5343200	Rob has the most way a shambling mounds are toughest guy in the world. He's status.
5349200	5354080	I did it. Um, Hey, Spencer. Hey guys. Um,
5356880	5365040	can I, I'm gonna take my elvish blade and I'm going to run in a circle around where the
5365040	5370720	the cultists are and just again like slice all the cultists as I run in a
5370720	5375680	circle all right well you can only attack one at a time what's you okay
5375680	5387200	let's do it we're doing it I'm just trying to be proactive I can't just sit
5387200	5393640	around wait also I partially caused this problem you summoned a demon and now
5393640	5398480	it's our job to kill this demon I would I would suppose you chopped the leg off
5398480	5404880	one of the cultists hell yeah yeah there's six more but that one he's on
5404880	5410160	the ground bleeding whatever what other what are the other coldest doing they're
5410160	5414720	hanging out it's there they're existing within the five seconds most of this
5414720	5422240	action is taking place within ish does it help when we chop down cultists it
5422240	5428040	certainly helps you should ask that before you that always the order should
5428040	5435640	be you're describing a conscience you ask that question and then you chop them I
5435640	5442880	did dismember this leg but was it good well is it is the is the gateway closing
5442880	5450240	no at this point the gateway looks as closed as it can get around a demon you
5450240	5456240	know like it's it's crude tight I'm shrub you got anything yeah I'm like
5456240	5462600	over the hill out of eye shot oh wow and I'm like walking down I'm going after him

5881140	5886260	go find that weird brony kid that like is obsessed with horses and and it's
5886260	5889940	ironically the one that keeps getting us in huge amounts of trouble hey just
5889940	5896780	random fucking DJ DJ get over here we're all talking shit about the church of
5896780	5900500	the silver flame and I mean we believe in a silver flame but the religious part
5900500	5910860	of it is kind of getting us down what am I their expense well okay so you're
5910860	5916500	you're fighting the demon right I guess yeah well like you witness a cavalry
5916500	5921420	arrive and it's you know them as the fourth cavalry of the church of militant
5921420	5927100	it's a faction of the the members of the church who save people from evil
5927100	5932460	demons and they actually just kind of make quick work of the cult and the
5932460	5937860	demons because they're highly trained this is exactly what they do
5937860	5945700	give you stuff and then they send you on your way catch then you catch back up so
5945700	5954300	they're like silver flame SWAT hey Gary play play it cool you know time in a
5954300	5960260	place let's change let's change the Nazis from the inside let's make an
5960260	5964580	agreement okay can we all I wasn't supposed to be leading either that was
5964580	5969380	just what was gonna happen no offense let's trust you not to create weird
5969380	5973500	princes in the pee situations that guide us but can we all kind of huddle up can
5973500	5976860	can the four of us get together and have a little huddle DJ we came up with
5976860	5980700	a new handshake quit what's the new handshake thumbs down and you make a
5980700	5983140	fart noise
5993580	5998060	well DJ is back there good journey now we're all together roll together now
5998060	6002820	we're all DJ that all happened in the past while you guys were were hashing it
6002820	6008380	out with with with Rob and then then he just caught up to damage what I look
6008380	6012940	like we all agree right now that we're all together now but it's for us it's
6012940	6016900	not for the it's not for the church it's for it's for what we believe in yeah and
6016900	6020980	I know that that's it's it's a less powerful conviction given that really
6020980	6024700	it's not the church's fault that we're constantly drunk and forgetting
6024700	6030580	everything we did but I do think it's like you can do the right things for the
6030580	6036140	wrong reasons like I think that we we were doing the wrong things for the
6036140	6040180	right reasons we will we've been trying to be good soldiers and like for the
6040180	6044060	church and stuff and it's not a job we're cut out for no I feel like this is
6044060	6048660	my hope and maybe this is unhealthy thinking if we start doing adventures
6048660	6055380	that that are based on our own agenda that we might remember him better and we
6055380	6064380	won't fuck him up hey uh hey Cornelius he disappeared like you can't summon an
6064380	6070460	ant that'll then just hang out sorry I don't mean that I've never summoned an
6070460	6082180	ant before and I look am I a bad person it's not it's a soldier that you would
6082180	6085500	watch fight for you and killed you and then you're like hey can I ask you a
6085500	6093220	question like it's Judd Hirsch on taxi it's like well pick a lane I summon a
6093220	6101060	person whose opinion I value to fight a troll well if we're relinquishing our
6101060	6106140	allegiance to the church keep your voice down should we should we come with a new
6106140	6111300	group name like like horse friends or super squad or something here's my vote
6111300	6116740	I don't think the church gives that much of a fuck about us they have no reason
6116740	6122820	to care I don't think we need to say to them hey whoa I declare my independence
6122820	6128700	they'll stamp us out like but what we can do is decide that we're not we're
6128700	6134820	not working for them anymore the silver flame didn't say make this church and
6134820	6138980	have this church be in charge of me the silver flame is a real thing does it
6138980	6144940	actually talk yeah I believe it does it I believe in the myth of the silver
6144940	6148100	flame and I'm using the word myth in the Campbellian phrase and Campbell is the
6148100	6153260	thing I'll tell you about later or but like it's I believe the story I believe
6153260	6159860	that the silver flame is real well while while Carlos is talking because I think
6159860	6163020	this is gonna go somewhere pretty big and important for yeah for where we're
6163020	6174020	headed do I have a second level spell in me so sure I cast Al's wisdom which
6174020	6180600	gives you who's Al Al from happy it gives you a plus four on wisdom right
6180600	6198080	yeah that could be good do not pollute like that's a reference okay so I then
6198080	6202920	I continue babbling and I it sounds wiser yeah way why is it like I'm saying
6202920	6208200	like look it doesn't I mean if this the silver flame is real the allegiance with
6208200	6213280	the church like I don't know man like I think they sent us out here on a what we
6213280	6221960	call a fuck run fucking Al Al's wisdom is fucking working right there's no such
6221960	6234160	phrase but but I can't believe I cast Al's wisdom and you came up with fuck run well you
6234160	6241680	didn't cast articulation no I'm saying it's working you like we were in a fucking fuck run
6241680	6251320	yeah the truth is the reason why I joined the church was was personal and I like it had to do
6251320	6256520	with the purification that the silver flame represents the idea that that there is an
6256520	6261680	empirical difference between good and bad and that and pure and impure and that it's not it's
6261680	6269920	not based on like people's subjective opinions that there is a truth out there an ideal that we
6269920	6276120	should strive for and God bless the church but like I don't I don't think you can organize
6276120	6282880	something to that to the level that our church has organized us and and be without corruption
6282880	6287320	of that thing and I'm not even saying that's why we should quit it I'm saying actually honestly
6287360	6295160	I'm an alcoholic and I'm a I'm a bad cleric like they got they had me in the library and like they
6295160	6301000	strategically like designed it so that it was a certain distance from the break room they knew
6301000	6305160	they know about my drink so what's your what do you what's your pitch I'm saying they let me out they
6305160	6310600	sent me on an adventure they knew I was gonna get drunk and they didn't care so that means they
6310600	6316680	didn't care if we lived or died I'm saying to you guys as a person with a Swiss cheese brain who
6316680	6323320	can't I can't I'm from one moment to the next I can't remember what we were doing like it's a bad
6323320	6330040	like I think we should we should be renegades it would suit us better so we shouldn't go to the
6330040	6339960	mining town well we should have the mining town come to us I guess there's really nothing we can
6339960	6346840	accomplish if we continue to not be able to remember what we did from one moment to the next
6347880	6355400	that's a good point whoa maybe we should try to be oh it's a sunflower I left the cult oh
6356440	6362680	I'm just improvising sorry um no I don't exist this is fake all right all right well okay must be nice
6363640	6372760	sorry there was a spiritual track what you're saying is simplify simplify and and and and maybe
6372760	6381640	play once a week I well yeah maybe if we I don't know man I'm yeah I don't know I mean uh I I know
6381640	6388600	that uh I'm uh I'm worried here's yeah I'm worried that I don't remember that we summoned a demon
6389400	6393880	like I felt like that was like a warning sign like when you wake up and you're like like oh
6393880	6401800	summon a demon and the like like I don't know when we did like I honestly I also as look you guys
6401800	6407240	know that I'm a gnome druid and you also know that I have improv gigs that come up once in a while
6407880	6414520	so I look I can't I can't always be here to cast owl's wisdom on people and summon ants like I said
6414600	6421720	sometimes I have to go do uh like sing dick jokes like in Rochester New York do you guys remember
6421720	6426760	barony mac whatever happened to that guy uh he's not here don't don't remember him
6428360	6434200	don't didn't remember he was a gnome don't remember he had tour dates don't remember a
6434200	6439720	lot what happened whenever I remember one thing come here on Monday where's Camille don't remember
6439720	6448920	what happened all right look let's you're saying let's let's keep it simple I'm trying to just go
6448920	6455720	with the yeah I'm going what are we doing we summoned a demon no that we we didn't these
6455720	6461960	no no but are we going to continue to obviously we're doing this wrong I feel like I've said this
6461960	6468440	before but I don't I want to be I want to be productive about it and go guys we're doing this
6468440	6471080	wrong yes
6475560	6483000	yeah so what are you running around in the circle and you're cutting people's legs I look I you're
6483000	6488600	like the talented Mr Ripley you're like it's like you're I'm trying to I'm trying to live up to your
6488600	6493080	greatness you rescued me from a little town I don't know what I'm doing are there I'm terrified

6549080	6553720	you know what guys are gross you know he's gone you know what the first thing we need to do is
6554360	6563240	we get like like a painter to paint our portrait and and put out calendars of our potato farm
