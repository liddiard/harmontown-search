0	4000	All right, let's start this bitch, kitty.
4000	17000	The Bell House, deep in the heart of beautiful
17000	19000	Kiwanis, New York.
19000	25000	Hello Brooklyn, you beautiful, beautiful bunch of weirdos.
26000	29000	I have some exceedingly good news for you.
29000	31000	Hermentown is now in session.
42000	46000	Please welcome the Mayor of Hermentown to the stage, Mr. Dan Hermon.
46000	73000	Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.
73000	75000	Holy crap, thank you.
75000	79000	And really, thank Jesus Christ and God above.
79000	81000	What have I done to deserve this?
81000	84000	There's a sea of humanity out here.
87000	90000	All I can do is fuck it up, that's it.
90000	93000	This is the coolest room I'll ever be in.
93000	96000	Even before you guys filled it with your coolness.
96000	99000	When this room was empty, I got a little intimidated.
99000	104000	This room feels very much like the Pixies must have played here at some point.
104000	107000	So much heroin must have been done here.
107000	114000	Daniel Day-Lewis probably got a hand job at some point during some Scorsese film.
114000	118000	If Hermentown had a dream venue, it would be this room.
118000	125000	For you listening at home, it looks like a town hall.
125000	136000	It's got this wooden stage. Jeff's podium was sanded out of Abe Lincoln's casket.
136000	140000	There's still a top hat in a drawer.
140000	143000	I feel like I should stand and have a Bible up here.
143000	149000	That's what Lincoln wore, right? A top hat? He was known as the fancy president.
149000	153000	Boy, it's great to get stove top, thank you.
154000	160000	Somebody's bothered to yell out a correction on the type of hat Abe Lincoln wears.
160000	164000	Now the audience is cheering that person for correcting Abe Lincoln.
164000	168000	For those of you who have listened to the podcast, especially on our tour,
168000	172000	people popping off from the audience is a huge staple of our diet up here.
172000	177000	Let's not springer them. Let's not wind them up.
177000	182000	Yes, it's true, Jeff, that eventually people do tend to get riled up and yell things out.
182000	186000	But we can't lose credit. Shut the fuck up!
186000	190000	All right, I will come out there and I will beat the fuck out of you!
190000	194000	I'm not intimidated by this city!
195000	200000	Fuck you, too! Can't understand you, can't hear you!
200000	204000	I don't care! Spike Lee shot stuff here.
204000	207000	Doesn't matter to me!
207000	211000	That was my fault. I rubbed the lamp too soon.
211000	214000	Anybody have a paternity test that's unresolved?
214000	218000	Just pop up here. Anybody not know what's going on in their life?
218000	222000	Just wander up. It's Brooklyn, Jeff. We could get stabbed.
222000	227000	No, you carry with it. That's the thing about New York versus L.A.
227000	231000	When I live in L.A., I lay in bed and I move my arms.
231000	235000	I don't touch another person from L.A.
235000	241000	We live a less insectoid, like colonial kind of existence out there.
241000	244000	It's more kind of lazy and sandboxy.
244000	249000	My friend Dino lived in New York for ten years.
249000	252000	He's not coming out.
252000	255000	But I think he put it best. He said, when you live in New York,
255000	258000	the coolest thing about it is that you live in New York.
258000	260000	You go to bed at the end of the day
260000	264000	and you can build a whole personality off the fact that you survived living in New York.
264000	266000	You're not able to do that in L.A.
266000	268000	No one gives a fuck about you in L.A.
268000	270000	You're never in anyone's way.
270000	272000	Every time I come to New York, I get instantly intimidated.
272000	274000	From the moment you step out of the airport
274000	278000	and you forget that you don't have the right away as a pedestrian,
278000	281000	immediately everyone's all too happy to remind you.
281000	283000	They will fucking run your ass over.
283000	287000	It's also the only town, at least in the U.S., I think.
287000	291000	I went into Soho today as we're staying here in Brooklyn,
291000	293000	but I subbed into Soho,
293000	295000	and I was just wearing jeans and a big parka,
295000	297000	like what I wore on the tour bus,
297000	300000	and I was the most underdressed dude in that town.
300000	303000	Everybody's just got perfect hair,
303000	306000	the kick-ass coat and a big-ass scarf for some reason.
306000	308000	They're all fancy here.
308000	310000	Everyone's fancy in New York.
310000	312000	Nobody says I'm weird for wearing a suit in this town.
312000	314000	It's amazing. You can wear a suit in New York.
314000	316000	It is a little nice since we're...
316000	318000	I'm not throwing the South under the bus,
318000	322000	but it will be nice to not spend a night talking about the fucking Civil War.
325000	327000	Holy shit, man.
327000	329000	I am exhausted.
329000	331000	Every city, I Wikipedia...
331000	333000	I Wikipedia'd Brooklyn, it was like,
333000	335000	George Washington farted here, and then, you know,
335000	337000	they built a bridge, Brooklyn Bridge.
337000	339000	Jeff, did you know Brooklyn Bridge?
339000	342000	First bridge between two. Who gives a shit?
342000	344000	It's Brooklyn.
344000	346000	It's...
346000	348000	This is the history right now.
348000	351000	For me, all I care about is Neil Diamond.
351000	354000	Yeah, he's coming out tonight, you guys.
354000	357000	You know what? Let's bring him out. Neil Diamond!
357000	360000	What did he did?
360000	362000	What if? God damn it.
362000	365000	Yeah, it's the biggest of the five boroughs, Jeff.
365000	367000	I think you know the other boroughs.
367000	382000	It's Manhattan, Chelsea, Pete Rose, Broadway, and Times Square.
382000	385000	But then Brooklyn is the biggest of all of them.
388000	390000	Like the rappers, they tire.
390000	392000	I heard a guy rapping about how each of the boroughs
392000	395000	is like one of the fingers in his hands that he used to sling rock with.
395000	398000	I thought that was really cool.
398000	400000	That's why I get really jealous in New York.
400000	401000	It's so much fucking culture.
401000	403000	Like, five boroughs, oh, there's five fingers and a fist,
403000	406000	and you sling rock with that hand, and it's just like,
406000	409000	fucking, oh, the Queen's is my middle finger.
409000	411000	Fuck you, motherfucker.
411000	413000	Like, it was such a badass rap.
413000	415000	Like...
415000	419000	I was looking forward to seeing some black people.
419000	421000	I'm scanning the crowd.
421000	424000	But honestly, in Los Angeles, we don't really...
424000	425000	Really?
425000	426000	You got some of them back there?
426000	427000	Okay.
427000	428000	Okay, we got some black people.
428000	429000	Okay, all right.
429000	431000	And when we say some, we mean two women.
431000	432000	That's it.
432000	434000	There are two black women.
434000	435000	All right, all right.
435000	436000	Let's get...
436000	437000	Who do we got back there?
437000	441000	And any of our resident black people want to come up
441000	444000	just for a quick interview?
444000	447000	Yeah, it just is a change of pace.
447000	449000	I just want to see you, give you a hug.
449000	452000	I've been in the South.
452000	455000	But honestly, it's like...
455000	456000	All right, we're coming.
456000	457000	We're coming.
460000	461000	Do you need help up?
476000	480000	Smooth black people are the way of the world.
480000	484000	I've got black people, black girl coming up on the stage.
484000	486000	It makes me feel so cool.
486000	490000	Got a black person going to jump in the black pool.
490000	492000	Find out what it's like to be black.
492000	496000	I don't want to have a hunky heart attack.
496000	499000	I want a black lady to give me some style.
499000	503000	Going to go from the West to the Egyptian Nile.
503000	506000	That's where black people started.
506000	507000	Egypt.
511000	516000	Funky, funky, king-tut black people.
521000	522000	I don't know.
522000	523000	I don't know.
524000	525000	Sorry.
525000	526000	Thank you.
529000	530000	You had all the power there.
530000	533000	You could have just given that a thumbs down and walked away.
533000	534000	I wanted the support.
534000	535000	What's your name?
535000	536000	Maya.
536000	538000	Oh, nice black lady name.
538000	539000	Maya.
539000	541000	I'm just going through withdrawal.
541000	542000	Black second.
542000	543000	Oh, Maya.
543000	544000	Black second.
544000	545000	Black second?
545000	548000	Oh, so you're doing the whole American melting thing.
548000	549000	You've got a lineup here.
549000	550000	Good.
550000	552000	This is one-stop shopping.
552000	554000	Are you from Brooklyn, Maya?
554000	556000	I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.
556000	557000	Whoa!
559000	560000	Where were you?
560000	562000	I'm going to talk to you about the Civil War.
566000	568000	You didn't escape it.
568000	569000	Who won?
569000	570000	I don't know.
570000	572000	We came back from there.
572000	573000	I think the answer is pretty quick.
573000	575000	We're still trying to figure that one out.
575000	577000	It was weird down there.
577000	581000	You can make more of a joke about racism up here.
581000	583000	Not because we're heroes.
583000	585000	We weren't involved.
585000	589000	Brooklyn's role in the Civil War was that they were getting high and eating sandwiches.
589000	590000	They said, you know what?
590000	591000	Slavery should be illegal.
591000	595000	Meanwhile, down there, everyone's dying and shit's happening.
595000	598000	My clothes are more expensive for some reason.
598000	604000	New York had it pretty hard with the racial rights, the draft rights and stuff like that.
604000	606000	Gangs in New York.
606000	607000	Them movies.
607000	612000	I like that they would just do a shot walking down the five points and there'd be nobody on the streets.
612000	615000	That really sparsely populated area.
615000	618000	Well, they cleared the streets because the gangs were going to have a fight.
618000	619000	I thought it was...
619000	620000	I don't know.
620000	622000	Scorsese can't really do any wrong by me.
622000	623000	Martin Scorsese's here.
623000	624000	Let's have a hand for him.
625000	626000	He's not here.
628000	630000	There's a chair down in front that says reserved and it's empty.
630000	631000	Who's this asshole?
631000	632000	That's...
633000	634000	Eddie Geller.
634000	635000	Eddie Geller?
635000	638000	Oh, here you go.
638000	640000	I don't need a seat reserved for me.
640000	641000	I'm coming.
641000	642000	Oh, that's Eddie better.
642000	643000	Sorry.
646000	647000	Yeah, he got the...
647000	649000	Maybe he saw where his seat was and goes, fuck that.
649000	652000	Save my seat.
652000	655000	I'm going who has who has who has.
661000	663000	We fucking Beatles used to...
665000	668000	Were you just ordering a drink in back or did you just get here?
668000	670000	I didn't realize there was a seat for me.
672000	673000	Did your friend say...
673000	675000	Here, let's get him on mic.
676000	678000	I'm not able to talk at the same time.
678000	679000	I'm sorry, Maya.
679000	680000	Stick around for a second.
680000	681000	That's okay.
681000	682000	I forgot you were there.
682000	684000	We're used to being the backdrop.
686000	688000	It's okay for her to play that card.
688000	691000	I brought her up literally as the black lady.
691000	693000	She gets to say whatever she...
693000	694000	She gets to...
694000	696000	She gets all the power.
699000	700000	Eddie better.
700000	701000	What's your name?
701000	702000	Eddie Geller.
702000	703000	Eddie Geller.
703000	704000	Thanks for coming.
704000	705000	Thank you for having me.
705000	708000	Can I get you anything dot dot dot a watch?
709000	711000	It's a standard, standard comedian thing.
711000	712000	Yeah.
715000	717000	Eddie, what are you most afraid of?
718000	720000	Being a failure.
721000	723000	I would have said spiders.
724000	725000	Spiders?
725000	727000	You're just a badass with spiders?
727000	728000	I'm okay with spiders.
728000	729000	I hate snakes, though.
729000	730000	Okay.
730000	731000	Snakes and being a failure.
732000	735000	Maya, let's do a scene from Eddie Geller's early childhood.
736000	738000	Do you have any theatrical background?
738000	740000	Do you think he can hold your own?
740000	741000	12 years old.
741000	742000	Summer camp.
742000	743000	Okay.
743000	744000	All right.
744000	746000	So I'll be 10-year-old Eddie Geller,
746000	750000	and we're going to do the scene where he learned to be afraid of snakes and failure.
759000	760000	Mommy?
760000	764000	Why are you so much more ethnic than me?
766000	770000	It was the immaculate conception again.
771000	776000	I never knew my dad, but I just wanted you to know that I love you.
777000	779000	Today's my first day of school.
783000	787000	Do you want to give me a pencil or like any clothes?
791000	792000	No.
795000	796000	But wait.
799000	800000	No.
803000	804000	Snakes!
804000	805000	Snakes!
805000	808000	No!
809000	811000	Well, that explains everything.
816000	818000	I guess that makes sense.
818000	822000	I guess it's okay for you to leave a gaping seat open
822000	826000	in the front of the totally phase me out on my first show in Brooklyn.
827000	830000	All right, Maya, what's your biggest ambition?
830000	832000	What's your biggest dream?
833000	835000	Well, that puts you on the spot, doesn't it?
835000	836000	It happened.
836000	838000	Oh, you're like me.
838000	839000	You've lived your dreams.
839000	840000	Yeah.
840000	844000	Like I turned 40 and I got to do a tour and play in this hip room in Brooklyn.
844000	846000	I'm just making up shit to do before I get hit by a car.
847000	848000	Like I already had a TV show.
848000	849000	I didn't deserve that.
849000	850000	I got fired from it.
850000	851000	They finally caught up.
851000	852000	I wasn't fishing for that.
852000	853000	I wasn't fishing for that.
853000	854000	Stop it.
855000	856000	It's not what I...
861000	864000	Mommy, why did NBC fire me?
867000	869000	Because they have no sense.
869000	870000	Thank you, Mommy.
870000	871000	Snakes!
873000	875000	We're not so different, Eddie Geller.
877000	879000	I'm your shadow father.
881000	884000	Okay, so Maya, I don't know.
884000	886000	So you really mean that?
886000	888000	You feel pretty self-actualized?
889000	890000	Self-actualized.
890000	893000	I mean, I live in Brooklyn and I'm a writer.
893000	895000	How self-actualistic.
895000	897000	Can't get better than that.
897000	899000	If I ever thought I was truly successful,
899000	901000	I would move to New York and try to be a writer here,
901000	904000	because that's the real writer thing.
904000	906000	Yeah, I don't understand why you're not here.
906000	908000	Shut the fuck up!
909000	911000	Is that real enough for you?
916000	919000	I just mind doing a bunch of heroin and jerking off on them.
919000	921000	Is that all in one motion?
922000	926000	When I feel like I have that maneuvered down,
926000	927000	I'll move to New York.
929000	931000	I'll start with a nice little place in Queens
931000	933000	and I'll just jerk off for a while
934000	936000	and then I'll add heroin to it.
937000	938000	All in one motion.
938000	940000	So what kind of stuff do you write?
941000	943000	I write a lot of lies.
943000	945000	So fiction, but I'm working on a screenplay.
945000	947000	What kind of fiction?
947000	949000	Long fiction, but I'm working on a screenplay.
949000	951000	Oh, long fiction working on a screenplay.
951000	952000	Who isn't working on a screenplay?
952000	953000	Anybody else?
956000	958000	That would be everybody in LA.
959000	961000	That's another nice thing about New York,
961000	963000	is that there's lots of creativity happening here,
963000	965000	but there's also a couple people lifting things for a living.
966000	967000	Someone has to...
968000	969000	That's the nice...
969000	973000	It's a real city that you feel like if Spielberg moves,
973000	975000	it won't fall apart immediately.
976000	977000	You walk down the street in Los Angeles
977000	978000	and you're like,
978000	980000	what's going to happen if he decides to go to Vermont
981000	983000	for more than a summer?
984000	986000	Spielberg lives everywhere, my friend.
987000	988000	Spielberg is here.
988000	989000	Let's bring him out.
991000	992000	He's not here.
993000	994000	Sorry.
995000	996000	Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
996000	1001000	Well, you know, maybe if you pray real hard,
1001000	1002000	it'll come out.
1002000	1003000	I don't know.
1003000	1004000	How does movies work?
1004000	1005000	Like you clap your hands or something?
1005000	1006000	Swelling violence.
1006000	1007000	Yeah, yeah.
1007000	1008000	And things happen.
1008000	1009000	Yeah, if the camera...
1009000	1011000	If we get a crane in here and make a big enough shot,
1011000	1012000	he'll come out.
1013000	1016000	All right, well, can I give you any help
1016000	1017000	writing your screenplay?
1017000	1018000	Are you stuck on any part?
1019000	1020000	I'm like an expert.
1020000	1022000	You're an expert.
1023000	1024000	Thank you, baby.
1025000	1026000	Monster house fans.
1027000	1028000	The house is a monster.
1028000	1030000	I don't know how I come up with this shit.
1032000	1034000	Houses aren't supposed to be monsters.
1034000	1037000	You're supposed to live in those motherfuckers.
1037000	1039000	What if they ate you?
1040000	1041000	That's Rob Schrab's idea.
1041000	1043000	Oh, where can you help me?
1044000	1045000	Where can you help me?
1046000	1047000	How should it end?
1047000	1048000	Okay.
1048000	1049000	Good.
1049000	1050000	I'm glad you asked.
1050000	1051000	Yeah.
1051000	1052000	Can you tell me a little bit what it's about
1052000	1053000	so that I can...
1056000	1061000	It is about a woman who was born with the voice of a man.
1061000	1063000	This sounds like a terrible idea.
1063000	1064000	No, I'm kidding.
1064000	1065000	I'm kidding.
1065000	1066000	It's a stupid, cheap joke.
1066000	1067000	Whatever she said.
1068000	1069000	A woman with the voice of a man?
1069000	1070000	Like, literally physically?
1070000	1072000	Like, when she speaks, she sounds like a dude?
1072000	1073000	Yeah.
1073000	1075000	So it's like a metaphor for, like...
1075000	1076000	Oh, it's no metaphor.
1076000	1077000	Oh, okay.
1077000	1079000	Is it based on a friend of yours?
1079000	1080000	Yes.
1080000	1081000	Oh, okay.
1081000	1082000	She has a lower register voice.
1082000	1083000	It's just a...
1083000	1085000	She sounds like a straight up dude.
1085000	1086000	Oh, okay.
1086000	1087000	Like this.
1087000	1088000	And so, all right, so...
1088000	1090000	Most beautiful woman you've ever seen.
1090000	1091000	All right.
1091000	1095000	So does she cross a threshold of starting to sound like a dude?
1095000	1096000	No, there's no threshold.
1096000	1099000	So it's like fade in on a woman that sounds like a guy.
1099000	1100000	And then...
1100000	1101000	Fade in.
1101000	1102000	Right.
1102000	1103000	And then...
1103000	1106000	So then what happens, like, what separates the Peter Weller from the Robocop?
1106000	1109000	Like, what's the threshold?
1109000	1111000	I'm a very pedantic screenwriter.
1111000	1113000	Like, I'm very structured.
1113000	1114000	Like, so we have to cross.
1114000	1116000	Like, when does Jaws roll into Amity?
1116000	1117000	When does...
1117000	1121000	You know, what's the yellow brick road that we start going down?
1121000	1125000	Like, what's the point where we realize, oh, shit, she sounds like a guy,
1125000	1130000	but now she's got to work as a telemarketer at an all-female...
1130000	1132000	She does Gillette commercials.
1132000	1133000	Gillette commercials?
1133000	1134000	And, like, the selling rate?
1134000	1136000	So it's like a reverse Tootsie.
1136000	1137000	Yes.
1137000	1138000	Okay, she gets a job.
1138000	1140000	That's how we're selling it, is reverse Tootsie.
1140000	1143000	That's how any good thing should be sold.
1143000	1148000	I thought a reverse Tootsie is when you poop on somebody's chest.
1148000	1152000	You can get a reverse Tootsie in Brooklyn for $40.
1152000	1153000	Same as in town.
1153000	1155000	Can you demonstrate what that is as well?
1155000	1156000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1156000	1161000	For those of you listening at home, I'm putting my ankle above my neck
1161000	1163000	and my hand is reaching down.
1163000	1165000	I'm putting my middle finger up my asshole.
1165000	1166000	Yeah.
1166000	1167000	Holy shit, yeah.
1167000	1171000	And now if I could just reach my...
1171000	1172000	Yeah, yeah.
1172000	1174000	Oh, reverse Tootsie.
1174000	1176000	All right.
1176000	1180000	Oh, enjoy that in Nashville.
1180000	1181000	All right.
1181000	1182000	You better add it in Nashville.
1182000	1183000	All right, so how should it end?
1183000	1184000	Okay, well, I assume it should end with...
1184000	1185000	Tell me.
1185000	1186000	Okay, so I'm assuming, like, she...
1186000	1188000	Okay, she talks like a guy.
1188000	1189000	She sounds like a guy.
1189000	1192000	So she crosses some threshold where she goes down a road to trials
1192000	1194000	and she meets with some goddess, blah, blah, blah.
1194000	1195000	I'm not...
1195000	1198000	All right, so she's happy at a certain point that she does sound like a guy
1198000	1202000	or either that, if it faded in on her sounding like a guy,
1202000	1205000	the threshold might be her starting to sound like a woman successfully
1205000	1207000	at which point at the midpoint she...
1207000	1208000	Hold on a second.
1208000	1210000	Are you taking notes?
1210000	1211000	All right.
1211000	1212000	So you've already...
1212000	1213000	Have you already written this movie?
1213000	1215000	Yeah, so she's good.
1215000	1216000	She just needs an ending.
1216000	1217000	She needs an ending.
1217000	1218000	Oh, okay.
1218000	1219000	I need an alternate ending.
1219000	1221000	Like Clue, you know how they have the three endings, I think.
1221000	1224000	All right.
1224000	1226000	All right, I have to workshop it from the beginning.
1226000	1227000	I have to, like, feel it.
1227000	1229000	I have to run my hands over the story.
1229000	1231000	So, Jeff, can you help me?
1231000	1234000	Maya, can we thank Maya and then we'll...
1234000	1236000	We're gonna give her an ending.
1236000	1238000	Thank you, Maya.
1238000	1239000	Thank you.
1239000	1247000	On behalf of all white men, thank you for being a black woman.
1247000	1253000	Beautiful, beautiful, wonderful, noble black woman.
1253000	1254000	Let's not get...
1254000	1255000	Let's not get...
1255000	1256000	Let's not get...
1256000	1259000	I mean, when we get down to that, like, I'm probably eight things.
1259000	1262000	Let's keep things binary.
1262000	1264000	That's how I'm comfortable.
1264000	1267000	You're either one race or another, goddamn it.
1267000	1270000	I demand it.
1270000	1271000	All right.
1271000	1272000	So, okay.
1272000	1274000	So, fade in, Jeff.
1274000	1277000	The woman who sounded like a guy.
1277000	1279000	Okay.
1279000	1282000	What age do we start her at?
1282000	1283000	I think we just fade in.
1283000	1284000	She's 30 years old.
1284000	1286000	She's doing her PowerPoint presentation for her ad firm.
1286000	1289000	Okay.
1289000	1293000	And furthermore, ad sales will go up
1293000	1297000	if we use our ad firm to sell ads.
1297000	1299000	Seems like a simplistic idea,
1299000	1301000	but sometimes the thing that's most obvious
1301000	1304000	is the thing that you need to do first.
1304000	1305000	My name's...
1305000	1310000	I have to interrupt Mrs. Tameras.
1310000	1312000	Yes, Glenn?
1312000	1316000	As a powerful white, icky male,
1316000	1318000	I'm having a hard time listening to you,
1318000	1321000	staring at your perfect tits and ass
1321000	1325000	and combining that with this incredibly dulcet, masculine voice
1325000	1327000	that you've been laying down.
1327000	1329000	Cut to just the title card,
1329000	1331000	and there's no music,
1331000	1333000	because this is a beautiful, independent film.
1333000	1334000	It's going to win an Oscar.
1334000	1339000	So it just says, like, dude voice.
1339000	1342000	And then she's on an airplane.
1342000	1344000	Ladies and gentlemen, you're captain.
1344000	1346000	You've been landing in Los Angeles.
1346000	1348000	Just keep your eyes on the window
1348000	1353000	and say you're captain stuff.
1353000	1356000	So, you here on business or pleasure?
1356000	1358000	I've been noticing you throughout the flight.
1358000	1359000	I'm a little shy.
1359000	1361000	Yeah, I'm married, but we're getting separated.
1361000	1364000	I just didn't want this whole flight to go by
1364000	1366000	and not connect with you.
1366000	1370000	You're used to an incredibly beautiful, fragile, wonderful...
1370000	1372000	Thank you.
1372000	1374000	Sorry, something wrong with your voice?
1374000	1376000	Wow, laryngitis.
1376000	1377000	Oh, really?
1377000	1380000	You know, I can give you something for that.
1386000	1389000	Sorry, the captain's saying something for me.
1389000	1393000	Ladies and gentlemen, you're penis.
1393000	1396000	That's aeronautic talk for the Grand Canyon.
1396000	1398000	We just flew over it.
1398000	1400000	We're on our way to Los Angeles.
1400000	1402000	I'll flag it for flag.
1402000	1404000	You know, I'm also...
1404000	1406000	I'm getting separated.
1406000	1409000	My wife didn't like the fact that what I do for a living
1409000	1411000	is I make the world's most delicious,
1411000	1413000	soothing and restorative chicken soup.
1413000	1415000	If you want to come back to my place,
1415000	1416000	I'll give you some chicken soup,
1416000	1418000	and we can restore your voice.
1418000	1420000	And then I can hear you talk.
1420000	1421000	My name is Jessica.
1421000	1423000	Oh, Jesus Christ!
1427000	1429000	He pooped his pants.
1429000	1430000	All right.
1430000	1433000	Well, that's not the crossing of the threshold.
1433000	1436000	That's the call to adventure, and we'll pick up.
1436000	1439000	We'll do another chapter of that in a little bit.
1439000	1441000	I don't want to get bogged down with that.
1441000	1444000	Yeah, that story's got legs.
1445000	1448000	I think a Billy Crystal or Robin Williams
1448000	1450000	might end up playing a magical shopkeeper
1450000	1452000	in that movie.
1452000	1454000	I think something's going to happen on page 17
1454000	1457000	that's going to make that thing break wide.
1457000	1460000	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
1460000	1463000	Jeff, you're sick of spilling all your colognes
1463000	1464000	all over the place.
1464000	1466000	You hate liquid colognes, is that correct?
1466000	1467000	It's my nemesis.
1467000	1470000	It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long.
1470000	1472000	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you
1472000	1475000	just covered in sticky wet cologne.
1475000	1479000	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear.
1479000	1482000	And then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse
1482000	1483000	for the rest of time.
1483000	1484000	Yeah.
1484000	1487000	But Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company
1487000	1489000	that specializes in solid colognes,
1489000	1490000	shave and shower products,
1490000	1493000	all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
1493000	1494000	Now, when you say solid colognes,
1494000	1496000	do you mean like solid in the jazz sense?
1496000	1499000	Like, wow, that jazz solo was solid.
1499000	1500000	You know, I do mean that,
1500000	1503000	but I also mean physically solid as well.
1503000	1504000	Oh, like a little...
1504000	1505000	Like, you're talking about a wax-based cologne
1505000	1507000	that travels in a little small package
1507000	1510000	that I can't spill all over my luggage
1510000	1514000	and smell like a Mexican tit house.
1514000	1516000	So these are travel-friendly wax-based colognes
1516000	1517000	that can go anywhere.
1517000	1519000	Plus, there's nothing to break or spill.
1519000	1521000	And of course, they all smell fantastic.
1521000	1522000	Fantastic.
1522000	1525000	Like a Mexican tit house.
1525000	1529000	I mean, there's different levels of Mexican tit house.
1529000	1531000	I mean, there's the high-quality ones.
1531000	1533000	There's the ones that you wish you didn't go to.
1533000	1534000	Right, yeah.
1534000	1536000	It does fantasticos.
1536000	1539000	Is one of their fragrances called Mexican tit house?
1539000	1540000	Yeah.
1540000	1543000	Que fantástico.
1543000	1545000	Fulton and Hork's bar soap is designed
1545000	1548000	to exfoliate the skin with or without a washcloth.
1548000	1549000	Also, you don't even have to touch it.
1549000	1551000	It comes in desert in the night.
1551000	1553000	Well, that's amazing.
1553000	1555000	That's literally unbelievable.
1555000	1557000	Did you know, Spencer, that GQ magazine
1557000	1559000	just named their shave cream
1559000	1561000	the very best on the market today?
1561000	1562000	Well, yeah, of course I knew that.
1562000	1563000	Why would you ask?
1563000	1564000	I mean, who am I asking?
1564000	1566000	I mean, this guy, you go to this house,
1566000	1568000	it's like an episode of Hoarders.
1568000	1570000	So many back issues of GQ magazine there.
1570000	1572000	Right, and I've got to tell you,
1572000	1574000	my house is made out of bricks of cologne.
1574000	1575000	Wax-based cologne, I hope.
1575000	1576000	Yeah, yeah.

1680000	1683000	I might do the singer songwriter Bill Cosby thing.
1683000	1684000	All right, yeah, yeah, let's do it.
1684000	1688000	Let's hear about your wife and kids and trips to the dentist.
1688000	1691000	Friends from the neighborhood.
1691000	1693000	No idea what to talk to you about or do with you,
1693000	1695000	but I thought it was cool that we were in town.
1695000	1697000	We've never had anything before.
1697000	1698000	We've gone along just fine.
1698000	1699000	Yeah, no, yeah.
1699000	1700000	We just go and drink.
1700000	1702000	Does anyone but us call you Suds?
1702000	1704000	No, Suds is the longest lasting.
1704000	1705000	Cool.
1705000	1708000	I mean, no, I'm saying, yes, a lot of people do.
1708000	1709000	Oh, okay.
1709000	1710000	All right.
1710000	1713000	I said no, no, it's not an original nickname.
1713000	1716000	But it's been along, it's a good one.
1717000	1718000	It's the best one.
1718000	1721000	Tell us something criminal about Lorne Michaels.
1721000	1726000	Something that would get you in a huge amount of trouble.
1726000	1729000	Something that would make him seem like a giant asshole
1729000	1732000	and get him in all kinds of like legal trouble
1732000	1734000	and destroy and scandalize.
1734000	1737000	Something that would be in TMZ tomorrow if you said it.
1737000	1740000	Something just like, something horrible
1740000	1742000	that would profit you nothing and cost you everything.
1742000	1743000	Yeah.
1747000	1750000	Oh, boy, just one?
1750000	1751000	Just one?
1751000	1752000	Yeah, just off the top.
1752000	1758000	Gosh, I guess it would be that he, you know,
1758000	1760000	I'm going to answer this, honestly.
1760000	1761000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1761000	1762000	Yeah.
1762000	1763000	We'll edit it out.
1763000	1768000	He, you know, Sandusky took the fall for him.
1768000	1769000	Yeah.
1774000	1778000	They knew each other from Toronto and they like,
1778000	1780000	and he just, you know, it's like, you know,
1780000	1783000	it's like the guy that took the hit and never, you know,
1783000	1784000	snitched for Jay-Z.
1784000	1786000	It's a very similar, I don't know,
1786000	1787000	I forget the guy's name.
1787000	1788000	He's referencing that song, Click.
1788000	1792000	But it's, yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, Sandusky was like,
1792000	1793000	I got it.
1793000	1797000	And Lorne was like, you know, thanks, Jer.
1799000	1800000	What are the five boroughs?
1800000	1801000	And that's just through reading emails,
1801000	1803000	sifting through his emails when he's away from the,
1803000	1806000	I mean, that's not, I haven't seen him do anything
1806000	1808000	with kids or anything.
1810000	1813000	Well, I was actually, I meant the recruiting violations.
1813000	1814000	I meant the recruiting violence.
1814000	1815000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1815000	1816000	That's fine.
1816000	1819000	It's all, it's all, it's all, honesty's the best thing
1819000	1821000	for him at this point.
1822000	1823000	Okay, what are the boroughs?
1823000	1826000	Because I want to do some, if and when I rap tonight,
1827000	1829000	I want to be like that one guy that I heard in that one rap
1829000	1832000	where he was like, he was going, I got Queens in my hand,
1832000	1834000	and I've got, I got Brooklyn on my thumb,
1834000	1838000	and I got, we got Bronx, Staten Island, Queens,
1838000	1841000	New Jersey, Manhattan.
1841000	1843000	Someone slipped New Jersey in there?
1843000	1844000	And then you'd-
1844000	1845000	And his crafty sons of bitches.
1845000	1846000	And then you'd-
1846000	1847000	They snuck it in.
1847000	1848000	They snuck it in.
1848000	1849000	All right.
1849000	1850000	Oh, come on.
1850000	1852000	Hey, was it, was it?
1852000	1856000	I believe Brooklyn was its own city until like 1898
1856000	1858000	when it was annexed by New York.
1858000	1860000	So isn't New Jersey kind of a kind of,
1860000	1864000	maybe you're jealous that they never succumb to annexation.
1865000	1866000	I don't know.
1866000	1870000	Why don't you marry New York if you like being annexed so much?
1870000	1872000	I don't know.
1872000	1875000	Maybe New Jersey's like a little, something to look up to.
1875000	1876000	They're proud.
1876000	1877000	They're independent.
1877000	1878000	I think-
1879000	1882000	All right.
1882000	1883000	Long Island.
1883000	1886000	How many people are from New Jersey right here?
1887000	1889000	What would you do without these people?
1892000	1893000	I think it's weird.
1893000	1895000	I think it's weird that there's half the people from New Jersey scream,
1895000	1897000	the other half just raise their hand.
1897000	1900000	And that's like, that I wouldn't have anticipated
1900000	1901000	based on the television programs.
1901000	1903000	I would have, I thought it would have been this.
1903000	1904000	Yeah.
1905000	1907000	They need professors too in New Jersey.
1908000	1911000	I don't understand this New Jersey class system,
1911000	1912000	like this whole thing.
1912000	1915000	I'm from Wisconsin and then I lived in Los Angeles.
1915000	1918000	So I don't understand the whole New Jersey thing,
1918000	1921000	like the take a dump on New Jersey.
1921000	1922000	What did they do?
1922000	1924000	Can you tell me as a New Yorker?
1924000	1926000	As a New Yorker, I mean-
1926000	1927000	From Kansas City?
1927000	1928000	Right, right, right.
1928000	1929000	By way.
1929000	1930000	I don't know.
1930000	1933000	I guess it's kind of like, no, I have no idea.
1933000	1934000	It's like-
1934000	1935000	You're right here.
1935000	1937000	Do we have a New Jersey person?
1937000	1939000	We have a New Jersey hater.
1939000	1940000	Okay, come up.
1940000	1942000	What's your name?
1942000	1943000	I'm Noah.
1943000	1944000	You're what?
1944000	1945000	Noah.
1945000	1946000	Noah, okay.
1946000	1948000	Noah, let's not boo people.
1948000	1949000	You can boo him.
1949000	1952000	Let's not treat him like he's from New Jersey.
1953000	1954000	All right, Noah.
1954000	1958000	What's the justification for the New Jersey hatred?
1958000	1962000	Well, New Jersey basically takes all the shitty stuff
1962000	1964000	that New York needs and just takes it
1964000	1966000	and puts it in their state.
1966000	1967000	And so I guess I'm thankful for that,
1967000	1969000	but at the same time, whenever I go there,
1969000	1971000	it smells really, really bad.
1971000	1972000	All right.
1972000	1973000	Of course.
1973000	1974000	I don't know.
1974000	1978000	As a Los Angelesian, a whole, whole city around you,
1978000	1980000	not known for its bouquet.
1980000	1982000	It's a great city.
1982000	1984000	So, all right.
1984000	1986000	Yeah, I guess it's-
1986000	1988000	I'm not going to solve this problem.
1988000	1990000	I thought I would come here and I could heal people.
1990000	1991000	You only have theory over here.
1991000	1994000	All right, ma'am, come on up.
1994000	1997000	It'd be nice if you were black, but come on up.
1997000	1998000	I'm Jewish.
1998000	1999000	Okay, she's Jewish.
1999000	2000000	Close enough.
2000000	2001000	White, black.
2001000	2002000	White, black.
2002000	2003000	What's your name?
2003000	2004000	Jewish is the white, black.
2004000	2005000	My name is Lisa.
2005000	2006000	Okay, Lisa.
2006000	2007000	Do you know Noah?
2007000	2008000	Oh, God, Noah disappeared.
2008000	2010000	Noah turned into a cup of beer.
2010000	2013000	More like Goa.
2013000	2014000	That's kind of- no, that's nice.
2014000	2016000	We applaud that behavior.
2016000	2019000	Noah dismissed himself and took his seat.
2019000	2022000	People from Jersey wouldn't do that.
2022000	2023000	I'm kidding.
2023000	2024000	He had to leave.
2024000	2025000	There was a flood warning.
2025000	2029000	Oh, stupid, stupid joke.
2029000	2030000	I don't even get it.
2030000	2031000	I don't-
2031000	2032000	Noah, flood.
2032000	2033000	Oh, Noah.
2033000	2035000	Wow, that was stupid.
2035000	2036000	Holy shit.
2036000	2037000	Wow.
2037000	2038000	All right.
2038000	2041000	Whoo!
2041000	2042000	Bible.
2042000	2045000	Bible.
2045000	2046000	Bible, jokes.
2046000	2047000	Bible.
2047000	2048000	All right.
2048000	2049000	I'm sorry.
2049000	2050000	Melissa, was it?
2050000	2051000	Lisa.
2051000	2052000	Lisa.
2052000	2053000	I was totally close.
2053000	2054000	All right.
2054000	2055000	It's all the letters are in there.
2055000	2057000	All the letters are in there.
2057000	2058000	Why did we bring you up?
2058000	2059000	I can't remember.
2059000	2063000	Recently, New Jersey annexed the Statue of Liberty from New York.
2063000	2066000	And that's straight crap.
2066000	2069000	So New Jersey stole the Statue of Liberty?
2069000	2071000	Straight up the gate, yeah.
2071000	2075000	Well, that's a dick move.
2075000	2078000	The whole point of that statue is that people can do whatever they want.
2078000	2080000	You can't just hoard it.
2080000	2081000	Yeah.
2081000	2082000	Yeah.
2082000	2083000	Yeah.
2083000	2084000	We let New Jerseyans in through that statue.
2084000	2086000	You can't just take it on your way out.
2086000	2087000	That's crazy.
2087000	2088000	Okay.
2088000	2089000	All right.
2089000	2090000	Fuck New Jersey.
2090000	2091000	All right.
2091000	2092000	All right.
2092000	2093000	Thank you, Lisa.
2093000	2094000	I guess that's-
2094000	2095000	Melissa.
2095000	2098000	Do you remember when David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear?
2098000	2099000	I sure do.
2099000	2100000	You guys are 20.
2100000	2101000	You don't remember.
2101000	2104000	But I remember I was watching it on TV.
2104000	2105000	I was like 10 years old.
2105000	2108000	And how else would you have watched it at that point?
2108000	2109000	Yeah.
2109000	2110000	I wasn't like Macaulay Culkin.
2110000	2113000	I didn't journey out here.
2113000	2115000	I was watching it on TV.
2115000	2118000	And he made it disappear with his brain.
2118000	2121000	And there was a radar thing next to him that showed up.
2121000	2122000	And there was a blip that disappeared.
2122000	2125000	And then he was like, oh, it's gone.
2125000	2127000	And then they showed that it was gone.
2127000	2128000	I was a 10-year-old kid.
2128000	2133000	I was watching it by myself when my parents were downstairs having a party or some kind.
2133000	2137000	And I don't know, there were keys involved and some bull.
2137000	2143000	And I just like- I kind of like- I was Marvel.
2143000	2144000	I was like, oh, shit.
2144000	2145000	He made it disappear.
2145000	2147000	And I kind of turned off the TV.
2147000	2151000	And I really thought that he made the Statue of Liberty disappear forever.
2151000	2156000	I was like talking to people at school going like, all that work.
2156000	2157000	You know, it's crazy.
2157000	2160000	It's like, and then some magical guy comes along and just-
2160000	2162000	I was like being really profound about it.
2162000	2165000	Like, I had some insight into it.
2165000	2169000	And then someone said, no, he made it reappear after you turned off the TV.
2169000	2172000	It's like a real deep level of object permanence for you.
2172000	2173000	Yeah.
2173000	2176000	Like, were you good at peek-a-boo as a kid?
2176000	2180000	You feel it?
2180000	2185000	I was the best at peek-a-boo.
2185000	2189000	If I can't see it, it does not exist.
2190000	2191000	Let's bring-
2191000	2192000	What is that?
2192000	2195000	This is my Samsung Gigantor.
2195000	2196000	Is that a phone?
2196000	2198000	I have the SUV of phones.
2198000	2200000	Dan, here's an iPad mini.
2200000	2201000	Hold yours up next to my mic.
2201000	2202000	Look at that.
2202000	2205000	It's not-
2205000	2207000	It's not-
2207000	2208000	All right.
2208000	2209000	Pretty big.
2209000	2210000	Jodie Foster.
2210000	2212000	All right.
2212000	2214000	Let's bring her out.
2214000	2215000	You never know now.
2215000	2218000	You can't get her out.
2219000	2220000	Can't get her out.
2220000	2221000	She's a tease.
2221000	2222000	You can tiptoe around it.
2222000	2224000	That was a weird speech.
2224000	2226000	I don't have to tell anybody that was a weird speech.
2226000	2230000	You have to tell people that didn't watch The Golden Globes like you assume everybody did.
2230000	2231000	I feel like-
2231000	2237000	Every year we do this with all these awards shows, these actors come out and they make these weird speeches.
2237000	2238000	Oh, here we go.
2238000	2240000	I feel like-
2240000	2246000	There needs-
2247000	2248000	Shouldn't they have a sign?
2248000	2250000	Is there a door you go through before-
2250000	2254000	Are you going to make an awkward speech for us in that genre?
2254000	2255000	Oh, no.
2255000	2257000	I could try that.
2259000	2264000	And the winner for fired off of most television series.
2264000	2268000	The Golden Globes goes to Dan Harmon.
2268000	2269000	Thank you.
2269000	2272000	Thank you.
2272000	2274000	Thank you for this award.
2275000	2278000	I know that you don't care.
2278000	2280000	I accept it.
2280000	2282000	I really appreciate it.
2282000	2284000	I'm going home now.
2284000	2285000	Thank you.
2285000	2286000	There.
2286000	2288000	That's not so hard, is it?
2288000	2293000	I feel like there should be a sign above the doorway you go through before you accept the award that says,
2293000	2295000	They don't care.
2295000	2297000	Just as a reminder really quick.
2297000	2299000	It's going to sound like they care.
2299000	2305000	There's a lot of actors out there applauding you and People Magazine cares and TMZ cares.
2305000	2309000	But largely not enough people that are watching care for you to go out and-
2309000	2310000	I missed what happened.
2310000	2311000	What did she do?
2311000	2313000	It was just odd.
2313000	2314000	That's all.
2314000	2318000	It's the 950th odd moment in an award show's history.
2318000	2325000	The Golden Globes famously, the director of that decided that they should seat people with really funny mismatchings
2325000	2327000	and there's lots of boos on that table.
2328000	2329000	I've only ever watched one.
2329000	2332000	I think there may have been a bag of pills on her table.
2332000	2338000	I just know that Annette Benning was absolutely shithouse drunk by the third thing.
2338000	2341000	She was sitting across from like an MC Hammer or somebody.
2341000	2342000	I don't know.
2343000	2346000	Annette Benning, did Bubsy come out this year?
2346000	2347000	What was she in?
2347000	2348000	I don't know.
2348000	2349000	It was a few years ago.
2349000	2350000	I don't know.
2350000	2351000	I didn't watch him.
2351000	2352000	I just watched the YouTube clip.
2352000	2353000	It was weird.
2353000	2356000	She came out and she quoted some SNL bit I've never seen.
2356000	2359000	Not that I don't watch it every week.
2361000	2362000	She said, I'm 50.
2362000	2363000	I'm 50.
2363000	2365000	And then made this weird Jeff Goldblum face.
2365000	2369000	How did you know it was from SNL then?
2369000	2370000	My girlfriend told me.
2370000	2371000	She's 28.
2371000	2372000	That tracks.
2372000	2373000	That tracks.
2373000	2374000	That's all it takes.
2374000	2376000	The internet would also have been acceptable.
2377000	2378000	All right.
2378000	2379000	Let's do some old school.
2379000	2381000	I tried to get Matlock on you.
2381000	2384000	Well, how did you, if you've never seen it?
2384000	2385000	No, you guys are safe.
2385000	2386000	You're safe.
2386000	2387000	You're a comedic institution.
2387000	2388000	You're fine.
2389000	2393000	Name a couple of your favorite Jason Todaka sketches from the last season or two.
2395000	2397000	I mean, you've known him for a good long time.
2397000	2399000	I like his Joseph Biden impression.
2399000	2400000	All right.
2403000	2409000	I like the funny tracksuit guy that does the dancing on the guy when he says, say what?
2410000	2412000	I thought about making him come out and do that.
2413000	2417000	But I was going to start rapping and then he'd come out and do the tracksuit dance.
2418000	2420000	But I was like, you don't win.
2428000	2430000	Dateline, Brooklyn, New York.
2430000	2432000	I fucked your mama with a spoon and a fork.
2432000	2434000	I fucked your mama all the way to the bridge.
2434000	2437000	Fucked your mama so hard her forehead had a ridge.
2437000	2438000	She was a Klingon.
2438000	2439000	Fucked her south.
2439000	2440000	Fucked her inner ear.
2440000	2441000	Fucked her inner mouth.
2441000	2442000	Fucked your mama's salt.
2442000	2443000	Fucked your mama's pussy.
2443000	2446000	Fucked your mama nothing rhymes with pussy.
2446000	2448000	Fucked your mama on a New York stage.
2449000	2451000	Fucked your mama I was all the rage breakdown.
2452000	2455000	There are seven, seven boroughs of New York.
2456000	2457000	East Stanton.
2458000	2459000	Queen Town.
2460000	2461000	Poughkeepsie.
2464000	2465000	Old Jersey.
2465000	2466000	New Jersey.
2467000	2469000	Bronx City.
2470000	2471000	Stanton Island.
2472000	2474000	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
2475000	2477000	Each of my fingers is a borough in New York.
2478000	2480000	I got queens on my thumb that's a fork.
2480000	2482000	I'm going to stab my little finger with it.
2482000	2483000	That's Stanton Island.
2483000	2484000	I don't give a fuck.
2484000	2486000	Shit, I've got to work on that.
2486000	2487000	I've got to work on that.
2490000	2494000	And by the end of the night I'm going to have like a, it's going to be like a metaphor.
2494000	2497000	Each of my fingers is a, it's a, it's a borough in New York.
2497000	2499000	I'm going to fucking sling rock with it.
2499000	2501000	Sling rock with my hand.
2501000	2505000	Each, each one fifth of my hand is a different borough.
2505000	2507000	I'm going to fucking do it.
2507000	2509000	Stanton Island is my thumb.
2509000	2511000	Get shit done.
2511000	2512000	Fuck queens.
2512000	2513000	You know what I mean?
2513000	2515000	Middle finger, fuck you.
2515000	2516000	Stanton Island again.
2516000	2517000	I can't fucking.
2518000	2519000	Bronx.
2519000	2522000	I think that'll loosen you up once you, once you accept the other boroughs.
2522000	2525000	Like that'll give you different things to rhyme with and.
2525000	2527000	Ring finger straight downtown.
2527000	2530000	Good fucking mama, Stanton Island.
2534000	2536000	It's, it's, it's close.
2536000	2542000	Dan, you're, I think, I think in the back of your head you were expecting to be bailed out by Jason coming up and doing his little dance.
2542000	2545000	And you were just kind of putting placeholders out there.
2545000	2546000	No, I don't put that.
2546000	2547000	I don't put that on other performers.
2547000	2549000	He's up here as a guest.
2549000	2551000	I don't, I don't care what anyone does.
2552000	2554000	I think it is a little out of breath.
2554000	2556000	I think it is time for a Joe Biden rap.
2561000	2563000	Joe Biden's going to rap in a minute.
2563000	2564000	I'm going to set him up.
2564000	2565000	Then you're going to be in it.
2565000	2567000	Joe Biden's going to do some rapping.
2567000	2568000	It's not going to be hack.
2568000	2570000	It's going to be long lasting.
2570000	2572000	You'll be talking about it on the way home.
2572000	2574000	Joe Biden's going to rap.
2574000	2575000	He's going to do it alone.
2575000	2577000	Joe Biden's going to rap to the stage.
2577000	2578000	Joe Biden.
2578000	2580000	Here it goes.
2581000	2585000	I mean, you know, I appreciate the opportunity, Dan.
2585000	2588000	It's really great to be here.
2588000	2592000	You know, I'd really just like to talk about gun control if that's all right.
2595000	2596000	Yeah.
2596000	2597000	Yeah.
2597000	2599000	You know, if it doesn't have to rhyme, it's easier for me.
2599000	2602000	I just simple man, you know, I just.
2604000	2605000	Does NBC own that?
2605000	2607000	Am I going to license that?
2607000	2608000	Yeah.
2608000	2609000	They have to ask.
2609000	2612000	Joe Biden has to ask NBC if he can do it.
2612000	2613000	But it's Comcast.
2613000	2614000	It's Comcast.
2614000	2616000	Jason, I have a question.
2616000	2620000	When you remember the cast, I know there's a there's a lot of I wouldn't say
2620000	2624000	about political stuff, but like it's hard to get your sketches in the show.
2624000	2625000	Like you can write a funny sketch.
2625000	2626000	It may not make it in the show.
2626000	2629000	And there's people that I think are probably, you know, in the past have been
2629000	2634000	more forward about getting this stuff into the reads, making it past the read
2634000	2635000	through is into the show.
2635000	2636000	Yes.
2636000	2640000	Well, when you because now it's it's written in stone that the show is always
2640000	2642000	going to start more or less with a political piece.
2642000	2643000	Yeah.
2643000	2646000	So when a new political figure comes on the scene and you kind of look like
2646000	2648000	that person, is it like the greatest day of your life?
2648000	2650000	And you're like, oh, I fucking got Biden.
2650000	2651000	This is it.
2651000	2652000	It may be early.
2652000	2654000	I think it probably is early on.
2654000	2659000	I would say that for me with Joe Biden, I I played him in like in like
2659000	2664000	Halloween of 2009 around then because Barack Obama came to do the show and
2664000	2665000	myself and Bill Hader.
2665000	2667000	Bill played like Chris Dodd, I think.
2667000	2672000	And I played Joe Biden and then cut to the summer of whatever.
2672000	2673000	No, the summer vote.
2673000	2674000	This would have been oh, seven.
2674000	2680000	So then cut to the summer of oh, eight or sorry, Halloween.
2680000	2681000	Oh, seven.
2681000	2682000	This is awful.
2682000	2684000	Here's the this is the part you're going to have to cut out.
2684000	2687000	You know, but but yeah.
2687000	2694000	So August, oh, eight, he he names Obama, names Biden as his as his guy as VP.
2694000	2698000	And then Fred Armisen, who was playing Obama at that point, text me, go, hey, man,
2698000	2700000	congrats, like with no context.
2700000	2703000	No, no context.
2703000	2704000	No context.
2704000	2705000	Well, congrats.
2705000	2707000	I was like, I want Biden.
2707000	2708000	And I was like, what?
2708000	2709000	What about it?
2709000	2710000	Like he got picked out.
2710000	2711000	So what?
2711000	2712000	He goes, well, you played him.
2712000	2713000	I go, I do.
2713000	2716000	So I forgot because, like, use it.
2716000	2718000	I mean, I wear up like a bald cap and fake teeth.
2718000	2721000	I mean, I put a there's a little they put a little fake nose tip on me.
2721000	2724000	I mean, it's a long way from, you know, just Chevy Chase just going out there and
2724000	2726000	falling down or like Dan Dan.
2726000	2727000	We'll never get back there.
2727000	2728000	Jimmy Kurt.
2728000	2729000	No, yeah.
2729000	2730000	No.
2730000	2731000	By the way, can I.
2731000	2732000	That's right.
2732000	2734000	You know, yeah.
2734000	2735000	Okay.
2735000	2737000	I know him better than anyone.
2737000	2738000	I work.
2738000	2740000	I have worked with him longer than anyone.
2740000	2745000	Literally, literally in the entire TV industry because I've known you since forever
2745000	2751000	that like that like that's I don't even think about you and him.
2751000	2752000	Like, that's so funny.
2752000	2755000	I've known you for years and years before any of that stuff went down.
2755000	2756000	So I'm just talking about shit in the world.
2756000	2758000	And then I realized, oh, you used it.
2758000	2759000	Yeah.
2759000	2760000	You were tight.
2760000	2761000	You say we're tight.
2761000	2762000	Yeah.
2762000	2763000	Humble brag.
2763000	2765000	Life is weird.
2765000	2770000	I just remind like I texted Chevy because we're in New York and he's often in New
2770000	2771000	York.
2771000	2773000	So I texted him to see if he could make it.
2773000	2774000	Spoilers.
2774000	2775000	He can't.
2775000	2776000	But I know.
2776000	2777000	I know.
2777000	2778000	I know.
2778000	2779000	You would have loved it.
2779000	2782880	He would have made a little between Jeff and I you will get enough like a garnish of Chevy
2782880	2786920	Chase possibly throughout just the performance I would say maybe just like what just just
2786920	2791000	as far as just like, you know, just I don't know what in whatever way.
2791000	2796880	I just I just want to I just want to I'm going to get drunk and send Dan racist voicemail.
2796880	2801680	I wouldn't say I wouldn't say like the the new the newest version maybe it maybe at his
2801680	2805680	most high web as most I can I can't do his impression.
2805680	2806680	Oh, I know.
2806680	2807680	I'm not talking about impression.
2807680	2808680	I'm talking about.
2808680	2810680	What am I talking about?
2810680	2811680	Height.
2811680	2812680	Oh, I got that.
2812680	2813680	Yeah.
2813680	2814680	Yeah.
2814680	2815680	That's what I'm talking about.
2815680	2816680	Watch this.
2816680	2817680	Watch this.
2817680	2818680	Jason.
2818680	2819680	You don't love this.
2819680	2820680	Yeah.
2820680	2821680	Now fall down.
2821680	2822680	Fall down.
2822680	2823680	I texted him.
2823680	2825080	I'm doing my show in Brooklyn tomorrow night.
2825080	2827000	Are you in New York?
2827000	2834000	And three hours later, he texted back the word country.
2834000	2836400	It's how do you spell it?
2836400	2838000	Is it two words or one word?
2838000	2841000	Is he calling you a name?
2841000	2848560	Yeah, that is like, does he have a treasure map he's going to give you or?
2848560	2851400	Is that the password to deactivate his burglar alarm?
2851400	2852400	Like what?
2852400	2853400	Who is he mistaking me for?
2854400	2855400	I tell you what he said.
2855400	2856400	He texted.
2856400	2857400	His last text was the word country.
2857400	2858400	I don't want to know what this guy meant.
2858400	2859400	Who was this guy?
2859400	2860400	What did he mean to people?
2860400	2861400	Country.
2863400	2864400	It's not too late.
2864400	2865400	It's like Citizen Chase.
2865400	2866400	That was Citizen Chase.
2866400	2867400	Let's try it, Paul.
2867400	2868400	Let's see.
2877400	2880400	Please pick up the phone.
2880400	2881400	Oh, my phone's ringing.
2884400	2885400	Come on.
2886400	2887400	Do a Chevy.
2896400	2898400	He doesn't have a voicemail, right?
2899400	2902400	This is the stand-in for Chevy Chase.
2903400	2909400	He can't come to the phone right now, but I'm going to get over to him as soon as I can,
2909400	2911400	as somebody who can only stand.
2914400	2916400	At the tone, please record your message.
2916400	2917400	Joe Biden.
2917400	2918400	Joe Biden leaves a message.
2918400	2919400	Hang out for a press conference.
2919400	2920400	Joe Biden message.
2922400	2923400	Hey, Chevy.
2923400	2925400	It's Joe Biden, Vice President.
2925400	2930400	I just want to say we thank you for being a great patriot and have fun in the country.
2931400	2933400	We hope the country always want to go back to it.
2933400	2934400	That was America.
2935400	2936400	All right.
2936400	2937400	There we go.
2938400	2939400	Joe Biden.
2939400	2942400	That's a pretty low-stakes prank.
2942400	2944400	We're not exactly the jerky boys.
2945400	2948400	Also, he has your phone number in his phone.
2948400	2949400	Yeah, that's true.
2949400	2950400	Also, I forgot.
2950400	2952400	It's not going to say Joe Biden.
2952400	2953400	It's not exactly the perfect crime.
2953400	2957400	It's going to say fat alcoholic asshole or whatever he has me in his phone.
2957400	2961400	I love that you're skirting around the fact that my impression of Joe Biden, and much
2961400	2964400	less anybody, sounds anything like Joe Biden.
2964400	2966400	I love that Fred Armisen called.
2966400	2967400	He was like, we got it.
2967400	2968400	We did it.
2968400	2970400	I was like, you don't look or sound anything like Joe Biden.
2970400	2972400	But I played him once before, so that's what gets set in stone.
2972400	2973400	I know.
2973400	2974400	That's what's amazing.
2974400	2979400	In TV writing in LA, it's like on community, sometimes people, you never know who wrote
2979400	2982400	a script that had a character in it, like Leonard or something.
2982400	2986400	It's like, there's all this weird shit with like, oh, I created that character because
2986400	2987400	I wrote that episode.
2987400	2992400	It actually translates into royalties and shit, and it gets pretty grody.
2993400	2994400	There's no reason to talk about that.
2994400	2995400	Edit that out.
2995400	2996400	Should we bring up Spencer at this point, Dan?
2996400	2997400	Yeah, yeah.
2997400	2998400	Let's bring Spencer up.
3001400	3002400	Jason has no idea.
3002400	3003400	He's never heard the show.
3003400	3004400	He doesn't know.
3010400	3012400	Standing ovation for Spencer.
3013400	3014400	I wasn't asking for it.
3014400	3015400	I was reporting it.
3015400	3016400	Reporting it.
3021400	3022400	Spencer's our dungeon master.
3024400	3025400	He plays Dungeons and Dragons.
3025400	3027400	What did you say?
3028400	3029400	Spencer is our dungeon master.
3029400	3030400	He plays Dungeons and Dragons with us.
3030400	3031400	Oh, great, great.
3031400	3032400	Do you have a heart out?
3032400	3035400	Do you need to go be married to Olivia Wilde or anything?
3036400	3038400	No, we haven't set a date.
3038400	3039400	Okay, all right.
3039400	3040400	Congratulations, right?
3040400	3041400	Thank you.
3041400	3042400	That wasn't secret news, was it?
3042400	3044400	She's Tron, right?
3044400	3045400	Well, she's...
3045400	3047400	You can't get engaged to Tron and have it be a secret.
3047400	3048400	She's glowing.
3048400	3050400	Yeah, you can see her from a mile away.
3050400	3051400	Yeah, okay.
3052400	3053400	No, I mean, it's not a secret anymore.
3053400	3054400	I mean, I don't think...
3054400	3055400	It was never really a secret.
3055400	3056400	It was just something, you know.
3056400	3057400	Let's call her.
3058400	3059400	She's asleep.
3060400	3061400	She's in the country.
3063400	3064400	A different country.
3064400	3065400	She's down-rezzing.
3066400	3067400	Yeah.
3067400	3069400	I'm trying to remember my Tron jokes.
3070400	3072400	Because I want to kill in Brooklyn, is why.
3073400	3074400	That's the brass ring.
3074400	3076400	I'm trying to remember my Tron jokes.
3077400	3078400	Original Tron jokes.
3079400	3082400	If you lose your identity disc...
3082400	3083400	I'm sorry.
3083400	3085400	You will be subject to immediate...
3085400	3087400	Not another de-resolution!
3088400	3090400	End of line, Dillinger.
3090400	3091400	Something like that.
3091400	3093400	Spencer, do you have any Tron references?
3095400	3096400	The Tron discs.
3099400	3101400	The 23-year-old Spencer.
3101400	3103400	Hey, Spencer, can we do a new segment?
3103400	3104400	I don't want to spring this on you.
3104400	3108400	I want to do a new segment called Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes.
3108400	3109400	Here we go.
3110400	3113400	Spencer has a very, very arch opinion about...
3113400	3115400	Is there a theme song you can play for it?
3115400	3117400	We've been riding on a tour bus with Spencer,
3117400	3118400	so we're learning all about each other.
3118400	3119400	This is our sixth stop.
3120400	3122400	The other shoe will not drop with Spencer.
3122400	3125400	Everything you learn about him, he becomes more and more awesome.
3126400	3130400	The latest thing, he has got a fucking hook in his craw.
3130400	3132400	What's the expression? A bee in his bonnet.
3132400	3133400	A hook in his craw?
3133400	3134400	I don't know.
3134400	3139400	He is up in arms about Looney Tunes for specific reasons.
3139400	3142400	Here's our first installment of Spencer Hates Looney Tunes.
3142400	3143400	Let me get some music.
3143400	3145400	Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes.
3150400	3152400	So, that daffy duck.
3152400	3154400	Fuck that guy.
3155400	3158400	No, I don't know. He just sucks.
3158400	3160400	I mean, does anyone like him?
3161400	3162400	Why?
3163400	3165400	Do you like that he's self-entitled,
3165400	3170400	or that he just feels compelled for it to be rabbit season?
3170400	3173400	I mean, when he's fighting with Bugs Bunny,
3173400	3176400	it's hard, because they're both assholes
3176400	3178400	and they both deserve to be shot and killed.
3180400	3182400	So, I mean, when it's both of those,
3182400	3184400	you can kind of, daffy duck's kind of okay,
3184400	3186400	but otherwise, fuck him.
3186400	3190400	Ladies and gentlemen, that's Spencer Hates Looney Tunes.
3190400	3192400	Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes.
3193400	3194400	Wow.
3201400	3202400	All right.
3202400	3203400	Spencer, dispense the character Hates.
3203400	3206400	Let's get Aaron McGathey to the stage, too, to play some...
3206400	3207400	You want to stay?
3207400	3209400	You want to play some D&D?
3209400	3210400	Yeah.
3210400	3211400	I've never played.
3211400	3212400	You don't have to know anything.
3212400	3213400	All right.
3213400	3215400	There might be something for Jason to do.
3215400	3217400	Like, you could play ancillary characters.
3217400	3219400	Like, we're going to play Dungeons and Dragons.
3219400	3221400	Can we, like, do a, like,
3221400	3223400	can we set up a Settlers of Catan board
3223400	3225400	on, like, stage left and, like...
3226400	3227400	Yeah.
3227400	3229400	That's my nerd shit.
3230400	3231400	That's the stuff I like.
3231400	3232400	So, yeah, you guys have characters...
3232400	3234400	Settlers of Catan is some Jersey shit, man.
3234400	3236400	Aaron McGathey?
3236400	3238400	Aaron, you out there?
3238400	3239400	Come on out.
3239400	3240400	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
3243400	3244400	Hello, Aaron.
3245400	3246400	Aaron, take a seat if you'd like.
3246400	3249400	I'd like to introduce one of my best friends.
3249400	3252400	Our moms both died of the same cancer, Eddie Geller.
3255400	3257400	My one comp during the tour.
3257400	3258400	No, I didn't know.
3258400	3259400	No, it's fine.
3259400	3260400	I'm sorry.
3260400	3261400	I didn't tell you that your seat was up front.
3261400	3262400	Thanks for being a good sport.
3262400	3264400	Thanks for being on my mom.
3265400	3266400	Our moms are dead.
3266400	3269400	Cancer is the Looney Tunes of disease, brother.
3270400	3273400	Spencer, get us up to date on our campaign if you would be so kind.
3273400	3274400	Hold on.
3274400	3275400	Phil.
3277400	3278400	Oh, yeah, right?
3279400	3281400	When we last met, probably.
3281400	3283400	Do you want me to stop, Spencer?
3283400	3284400	No, I'm good.
3284400	3287400	Last time, our heroes.
3289400	3294400	Last time, our heroes had just reunited in the starboard side of a flying black airship.
3294400	3297400	Sirens blaring and cannons firing.
3297400	3302400	After splitting up in a dramatic fashion, Quark had been infiltrating Darkstar's vessel.
3302400	3305400	But now, together with the power of Butzalot's teleporting cape,
3305400	3309400	Sharpie and Bullrain quickly ported to Quark.
3309400	3312400	Blasting open a large door, they worked their way through the ship.
3312400	3316400	After facing down a nine naked foe with a wicked whip,
3316400	3319400	the party gained access to a room full of lockers.
3319400	3325400	They found treasure from a loot of Charmin to some beads of force to some magic arrows.
3325400	3331400	Using a magical staff, they found, the party ascended through some sort of hatch in the floor.
3342400	3343400	So, less dramatic.
3343400	3345400	Do you guys remember you were in a room full of treasure?
3345400	3349400	You found, like, this magic staff, and you were writing it to the top?
3352400	3354400	That's just what happened.
3355400	3357400	If there's any bad guys or anything, Jason, you can play them.
3357400	3359400	No, I'm checking them out.
3361400	3362400	So, okay.
3362400	3366400	So, there's a hatch right above you since you can't all pop through at the same time.
3366400	3368400	So, you're going to have to figure out an order to go in.
3368400	3370400	All right.
3370400	3372400	Ladies first.
3372400	3373400	Ah, thank you.
3373400	3375400	Newly lady.
3375400	3376400	Jason, I just turned into a woman.
3376400	3377400	Oh, that's great.
3377400	3378400	Thank you.
3378400	3379400	Within the game.
3379400	3380400	Yes, within the game.
3380400	3381400	Within the game.
3381400	3382400	No, no, no.
3382400	3383400	I'll go first.
3383400	3385400	It's a gentleman's obligation.
3385400	3386400	Okay.
3386400	3387400	Yeah.
3387400	3388400	All right.
3388400	3389400	Then who?
3389400	3390400	Who's next and who's last?
3390400	3391400	I'll bring up the rear.
3391400	3392400	All right.
3392400	3393400	All right.
3393400	3395400	Can we talk about what happened in the hotel room today?
3395400	3396400	Yes.
3396400	3399400	Is it sexist?
3399400	3401400	No, we can talk about it.
3401400	3402400	I thought it was amazing.
3402400	3403400	I don't know.
3403400	3404400	You're freeing, too.
3404400	3406400	You want me to roll a six and a nine?
3406400	3407400	Oh.
3407400	3408400	Oh.
3408400	3409400	Oh, my God.
3409400	3423400	Apparently, when you go on a month-long tour with your girlfriend, that guarantees that
3423400	3430400	there's going to be a moment like today where you burst into tears out of nowhere and said,
3430400	3432400	I just want you to love me.
3432400	3433400	Yeah.
3433400	3434400	Yeah.
3434400	3435400	And we're crying.
3435400	3436400	Yeah.
3436400	3437400	Adventure.
3437400	3450400	I'm sorry, ladies, because I don't want to out us, but I believe that I am about to have
3450400	3458400	my period.
3459400	3460400	I don't get angry.
3460400	3461400	My PMS style isn't angry.
3461400	3462400	It's just tears.
3462400	3469400	And I said to Dan, hey, out of nowhere, hey, is everything cool?
3469400	3475400	And he said to me, hey, Aaron, you've got to deal with this shit on your own.
3475400	3481400	I'm not soliciting a boom.
3481400	3482400	I'm not soliciting a boom.
3482400	3483400	But I just started crying.
3483400	3486400	And I was like, Aaron, just go to the mirror and just look in the mirror and you'll be
3486400	3487400	fine.
3487400	3490400	But somehow looking at myself crying in the mirror made me cry more.
3490400	3496400	So then when I came back to Dan, I was covered in tears and swollen and just like, is this
3496400	3497400	dumb?
3497400	3498400	And then I put it in your mouth.
3498400	3499400	And I was looking at my laptop.
3499400	3500400	And I just heard, Dan.
3500400	3501400	And I looked up.
3501400	3503400	And I was like, Jesus Christ, what's happening?
3503400	3507400	Hey, guys, guys, are you going to climb this staff or what?
3507400	3510400	This guy hates emotion.
3510400	3513400	I'm sitting down on a magic staff like an asshole down here.
3514400	3517400	I just wanted to say, because I'm bad at it when we're one on one.
3517400	3524400	I'm like a Jim Carrey type who can only express himself through entertainment.
3524400	3531400	I'm very sorry that you had period feelings today.
3531400	3538400	And I will be there for you through all your periods.
3538400	3541400	All of them, they come every month.
3541400	3542400	Yeah.
3542400	3545400	But maybe not next month.
3545400	3546400	Right.
3546400	3548400	Yeah.
3548400	3553400	I don't like using condoms.
3553400	3554400	All right.
3554400	3556400	Let's get back to you.
3556400	3557400	I'm sorry.
3557400	3558400	I'm sorry.
3558400	3559400	It's OK.
3559400	3560400	It's OK.
3560400	3561400	I just thought it was amazing.
3561400	3564400	Jason, can we talk about what happened in the hotel room earlier with me and you?
3564400	3567400	Did Olivia ever cry for no reason?
3567400	3568400	OK.
3568400	3573400	Jason, you have an amazing, beautiful, wonderful fiance.
3573400	3574400	Thank you.
3574400	3575400	Yeah.
3575400	3576400	She cries for no reason sometimes.
3576400	3578400	But she's brand new.
3578400	3583400	You're going to find out that there's a de-resification that happens.
3583400	3586400	Her ram is going to mainframe.
3586400	3587400	A year.
3587400	3588400	A year.
3588400	3589400	Yeah.
3589400	3590400	Well, we've been together a year.
3590400	3591400	Yeah.
3591400	3592400	Well, and men have mood swings too.
3592400	3593400	We sure do.
3593400	3594400	Yeah.
3594400	3596400	Do I need to turn this thing on at all or something?
3596400	3597400	No, no.
3597400	3599400	That's for the movie that you're now in.
3599400	3600400	What's the...
3600400	3601400	I forget our silent guy's name.
3601400	3603400	Is there one more mic for Jason while we're up here?
3603400	3604400	No?
3604400	3605400	Oh, this is for the video.
3605400	3606400	OK.
3606400	3607400	Yeah, yeah.
3607400	3608400	This is just for the live crowd.
3608400	3609400	All right.
3609400	3610400	Sorry.
3610400	3611400	I'm sorry about that.
3611400	3612400	Yes.
3612400	3613400	Sometimes she does cry, but it's...
3613400	3614400	Gorgeous.
3614400	3616400	You come when she cries.
3616400	3618400	Oh, go on.
3618400	3622400	She cries and looks in the mirror and goes, oh, yeah.
3622400	3627400	She cries and deer walk into the room and lick her tears off of her gorgeous face.
3627400	3628400	Revlon.
3628400	3630400	Just Revlon falling off her, just dripping on the mascara.
3630400	3632400	Is she literally the Revlon model?
3632400	3633400	She must be...
3633400	3634400	One of them.
3634400	3635400	She's one of them.
3635400	3636400	God damn it.
3636400	3637400	They actually...
3637400	3640400	Revlon actually uses the mascara that drips off of her cheeks.
3640400	3642400	They bottle it and give it to regular women.
3642400	3644400	I'm the Teflon role model.
3644400	3645400	Oh, that's great.
3645400	3646400	Yeah.
3646400	3647400	That's great.
3647400	3648400	That's great.
3648400	3654400	How integral in your fiancé falling in love with you was your Joe Biden impression?
3654400	3658400	I would say that Mitt Romney maybe had more...
3658400	3661400	I think she already loved me at that point, but I think Mitt Romney had more to do with
3661400	3664400	it because she's very active politically on the...
3664400	3666400	Well, at least back then on the opposite side.
3666400	3667400	Oh, really?
3667400	3668400	Yeah.
3668400	3669400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3669400	3670400	Jason, do you ever get sick of how beautiful she is?
3670400	3677400	Do you ever just want to throw a brick at her nose?
3677400	3678400	I haven't.
3678400	3679400	I haven't.
3679400	3682400	It's actually really, really neat.
3682400	3683400	It's true love.
3683400	3684400	It's true.
3684400	3686400	Like soaking wet or with no makeup on.
3686400	3688400	You look at her and you're just kind of like, oh, yeah, all right.
3688400	3689400	Yeah, she's an angel.
3689400	3690400	She's an angel.
3690400	3693400	Yeah, she can say really hard, mean stuff.
3693400	3694400	Or not mean, but like...
3694400	3695400	Oh, so you're an angel.
3695400	3696400	Sharp stuff.
3696400	3697400	Two angels.
3697400	3701400	Two angels met in heaven on Earth and are now marrying wonderful angels.
3701400	3702400	That's fact.
3702400	3703400	I mean, that's fact.
3703400	3704400	Congratulations.
3704400	3706400	Yeah, thank you.
3706400	3709400	My dialogue will be put in a card that will be sent to you.
3709400	3710400	I appreciate it.
3710400	3711400	I'll take it.
3711400	3712400	I'm starting to feel like she's mad that she's with me.
3712400	3714400	No, no, no, no, no.
3714400	3716400	Not at all.
3716400	3717400	Not at all.
3717400	3718400	All right.
3718400	3719400	Sorry, Spencer.
3719400	3721400	It's all good.
3721400	3722400	I'm enjoying myself.
3722400	3724400	I just wanted to make sure we didn't leave Brooklyn without a human moment.
3724400	3727400	You know, like I want to make sure that these guys get their money's worth.
3727400	3728400	Brooklyn, make sure that too.
3728400	3729400	And that's what I like about Brooklyn.
3729400	3731400	Brooklyn, make sure you don't leave without a human moment either.
3731400	3735400	Oh, it's Brooklyn Governor Mel Poops.
3735400	3736400	Mel Poops.
3736400	3737400	Mel Poops.
3737400	3738400	Mel Poops.
3738400	3739400	Oh.
3739400	3742400	P-U-U-P-S. It's Dutch.
3742400	3746400	Mel Poops.
3746400	3747400	Brooklyn has its own governor.
3747400	3748400	Did you know that, Jeff?
3748400	3749400	I did not know that.
3749400	3750400	Yeah.
3750400	3752400	And it's not Mel Poops.
3752400	3753400	I know that.
3753400	3754400	What's your name?
3754400	3755400	Marty Markowitz.
3755400	3758400	Marty Markowitz?
3758400	3760400	Marty Markowitz?
3760400	3761400	Marty Markowitz.
3761400	3762400	Marty Markowitz.
3762400	3765400	I think I have my pants tailored by him, I think.
3765400	3767400	All right, Spencer.
3767400	3769400	You'll get the best pants for your body shape.
3769400	3772400	That's the Mel Markowitz guarantee.
3772400	3774400	Marty Markowitz, sorry.
3774400	3776400	Also, I'm the governor.
3776400	3780400	Yeah, ask me about my state.
3780400	3782400	Buy a suit, I'll govern you.
3782400	3784400	You want to pardon?
3784400	3789400	Buy suits from me.
3789400	3791400	Tuesday is belt day.
3791400	3792400	Come in, get a belt.
3792400	3794400	I'll govern you.
3794400	3798400	Let me govern the slacks in your trousers.
3798400	3803400	The first person to buy three suits, I'll appoint district attorney.
3803400	3809400	Does your waistline need to be legislated?
3809400	3811400	I'm Marty Markowitz.
3811400	3817400	I'll cuff your pants and make a law.
3817400	3821400	For every two pairs of pants, you get to make a law.
3821400	3823400	All right, sorry, Spencer.
3823400	3824400	All right.
3824400	3831400	Popping your head through the hatch, you are facing four large black leather chairs.
3831400	3833400	You see four people in this room.
3833400	3835400	A large steering wheel stands in the center,
3835400	3839400	and a huge glass panel behind you reveals the world below.
3839400	3842400	Standing at the wheel is a large, darkly armored knight,
3842400	3845400	staring ahead and guiding the wheel gently.
3845400	3849400	As you enter, three of the other people leap to their feet.
3849400	3852400	They're wearing orange coveralls stained with dark spots.
3852400	3854400	They quickly yell at you in abyssal.
3854400	3856400	How did you get in here?
3856400	3858400	Jesus and the Yankees can do some of those parts.
3858400	3861400	I'm one of the four people, I think, involved here, aren't I?
3861400	3864400	Yeah, I could have you that, or you could be a good guy back there.
3864400	3865400	No, don't tell me how you can make it.
3865400	3867400	Tell me what it is.
3867400	3871400	There's four people in this room, and you can be one of them.
3871400	3872400	Be one of the bad guys.
3872400	3873400	Yell at me in abyssal.
3874400	3877400	One of those guys has got to be Admiral Darkstar, the guy in the middle, right?
3877400	3882400	You actually recognize, although similarly clothed, it's not the same man.
3882400	3887400	Sidebar, super tough to be dungeon master when a guy's got you on his tour bus, right?
3887400	3891400	Yeah, because if I kill off his character, he's just going to dump me.
3891400	3893400	Yeah, I'd be like,
3893400	3897400	Oh, your coffee didn't roll a three against my piss, did it?
3897400	3903400	Well, drink your coffee then, right?
3903400	3906400	Guess you're bunked in save versus being shit in.
3906400	3908400	I know purify food and drink.
3910400	3911400	Wow.
3911400	3912400	Dungeon snap!
3912400	3913400	Dungeon snap!
3916400	3919400	All right, so you want to yell at him then?
3919400	3921400	Can we just stop and say that we're at the Bell House in Brooklyn.
3921400	3924400	We have to be the first show that played D&D on stage here, right?
3928400	3929400	No, maybe not.
3929400	3930400	It was Brian Posein here earlier.
3930400	3931400	Sorry.
3932400	3935400	Ryan Adams may have done a song about it, maybe.
3936400	3937400	So what's my motivation?
3937400	3938400	What am I yelling at about?
3938400	3942400	You're a crewman and some random dude just popped up through this bottom hatch
3942400	3945400	in what's normally an inaccessible area of the ship.
3945400	3946400	What the fudge?
3947400	3949400	From this place, I swear words like, yeah, fuck.
3949400	3950400	Yeah.
3950400	3951400	What the fudge?
3953400	3956400	The bottom of the ship's broken.
3957400	3958400	Yeah.
3963400	3966400	Do you want to climb out of the hole or you're just kind of like poking out of
3966400	3967400	this whole whack-a-mole style?
3967400	3973400	I cast Summon Monster 2 into the bridge and then drop down.
3973400	3974400	Okay.
3974400	3976400	What a monster do you want to summon.
3976400	3979400	Last time I think you summoned a Celestial Bee.
3979400	3980400	Yeah.
3982400	3983400	All right, all right.
3983400	3984400	Squid, squid.
3988400	3991400	Casting your hands in a magical manner.
3991400	3994400	A large fiendish squid appears in the room.
3995400	3996400	I drop down.
3996400	3999400	It lands on one of the guards, trapping it under its bulk.
3999400	4001400	What the fudge?
4002400	4003400	Fludge?
4004400	4006400	Guys, there's four people up there in black armor.
4006400	4011400	I put a squid on them, but I'll be darned if I'm not tapped.
4011400	4014400	Black ink drips down from the floor above.
4014400	4016400	I fire two arrows.
4018400	4022400	Okay, so you're not currently in the room, so you poke your head up and do that?
4022400	4024400	We're still down below the hatch.
4024400	4025400	Yeah.
4025400	4026400	I climb up.
4026400	4027400	I'm sorry.
4027400	4028400	I thought I was above the hatch.
4028400	4029400	Okay.
4029400	4032400	I climb above and I fire two arrows.
4035400	4036400	Oh, shit.
4037400	4039400	You fire both of the arrows.
4039400	4040400	They go wild.
4040400	4042400	One strikes you in the foot.
4043400	4046400	You take seven damage and fall down the shaft.
4048400	4049400	I deserved it.
4049400	4051400	Someone hates arrows and booed me when I fired you.
4051400	4054400	For the audience, she rolled double critical fails.
4055400	4057400	That's what you get for having a period.
4059400	4060400	So we have...
4062400	4065400	Was it a critical attack on the squid on the one guy?
4065400	4068400	You don't know how exactly that played out.
4068400	4071400	But we just know he's got a squid on him, so he's subdued for a bit.
4071400	4072400	Well, you don't know what happened.
4072400	4076400	You just saw your friend shooting arrow into her foot and fall off.
4076400	4079400	I disregard that and climb up the hatch and jump into the room.
4080400	4081400	Shocking.
4081400	4084400	Launching into the room, you're met with a grisly scene.
4084400	4088400	Although the black, dark armored figure hasn't moved from the wheel,
4088400	4090400	three of the men lie trapped under the squid.
4090400	4092400	They seem unable to move.
4094400	4096400	Can I just go up to him with my great flaming sword
4096400	4098400	and poke him on the side while they're under the squid?
4098400	4102400	No, because I put the thing on autopilot and turn to face you.
4103400	4104400	Yes.
4106400	4109400	Jason Sudeikis, ladies and gentlemen.
4109400	4112400	He's... he's junctioning the fuck out of this guy.
4112400	4115400	So you're the pilot of this ship, is your motivation?
4115400	4116400	I get it now.
4116400	4119400	I go into a... I go into a...
4119400	4120400	Where are my hit points at?
4120400	4125400	Hey, hey, I got... guys, guys, I gotta find out where my hit points are, okay?
4125400	4126400	What are my hit points?
4126400	4127400	Right now you're at 33.
4127400	4129400	The amulet got me back to 33?
4129400	4130400	Yeah.
4130400	4133400	All right, is this a good time to go into a... into a berserker rage?
4134400	4136400	Sounds like it.
4137400	4139400	Can I use intimidate too?
4139400	4141400	You could do... once you're...
4141400	4143400	I would prefer you didn't.
4144400	4146400	Intimidate first, rage later.
4146400	4147400	Okay, I intimidate first.
4147400	4149400	Okay. Are you gonna intimidate the black armored figure?
4149400	4152400	Yeah, I'm gonna take my shirt off and intimidate this guy.
4153400	4155400	You feel rather intimidated.
4155400	4158400	You seem like he might kick your ass if you're not careful.
4158400	4160400	This guides your actions.
4160400	4163400	Okay, great. So then I go into a berserker rage.
4166400	4168400	You see a halfling before you.
4168400	4174400	He's a good four feet tall, but now he's swelling, growing in size, rippling with muscles.
4174400	4176400	Ladies, come on, all right.
4179400	4180400	So now he's how big?
4180400	4181400	Are you gonna attack or...?
4181400	4184400	Yeah, a flaming great sword attack.
4184400	4186400	Flaming great sword attack.
4187400	4189400	Eh, you missed, sorry.
4190400	4194400	Swinging wide, your blade catches just the tip of his helmet.
4196400	4197400	That's where you want it.
4197400	4199400	So I circumcised him.
4200400	4201400	We'll see.
4204400	4207400	I regroup.
4207400	4208400	You regroup.
4208400	4210400	What is my spell?
4210400	4212400	Tasha's hideous laughter.
4212400	4215400	It afflicts the person with a dangerous laughter.
4215400	4218400	They can't take any other actions because they're rolling on the floor so hard.
4219400	4220400	Oh, my God.
4220400	4221400	Yeah.
4221400	4223400	Well, I better crawl up into the fray here.
4223400	4225400	Crawling up into the fray.
4225400	4227400	You crawl up into the fray.
4231400	4234400	Hey, there's a time and a place for the ray of frost.
4234400	4237400	Oh, I didn't mention you're holding an axe, by the way.
4237400	4238400	It's a pretty wicked axe.
4238400	4239400	Yeah, I know.
4240400	4243400	Like a Gibson Les Paul or something like that?
4245400	4246400	It may be.
4246400	4248400	It's better than your loot.
4250400	4251400	Dungeon snap!
4252400	4254400	Dungeon snap!
4257400	4259400	So I'm a halfling and this dark armor dude.
4259400	4260400	I'm both these people.
4260400	4262400	I'm taking on these people.
4262400	4263400	He's the halfling.
4263400	4265400	So I was describing what you were seeing.
4265400	4266400	Oh, okay.
4266400	4267400	So yeah.
4268400	4269400	All right.
4269400	4270400	You're this dark.
4270400	4271400	I'm still this guy.
4271400	4272400	Yeah.
4272400	4273400	This armor.
4273400	4274400	Okay.
4274400	4275400	Do a thing.
4275400	4276400	Yeah.
4276400	4277400	It's your turn.
4277400	4278400	It's my turn.
4278400	4279400	Yeah.
4279400	4280400	Oh, all right.
4280400	4281400	I want to...
4281400	4282400	You know what I'd like to do?
4282400	4286400	I'd like to crush up a billiard ball and blow it in his face like a smooth criminal.
4288400	4289400	Nice.
4293400	4294400	That happens.
4294400	4295400	That happens.
4295400	4298400	I'm going to say it again just really quick because I want to get it right in my mind.
4298400	4301400	I want to grab a cue ball off a nearby billiard table.
4302400	4303400	I want to grab it.
4303400	4304400	I want to hold up in front of it like this.
4304400	4307400	I want to crush it in my hand to show my superior strength.
4307400	4310400	And then I would just be going real fucking nonchalant.
4310400	4312400	And he'd go in his face and be like...
4312400	4315400	Very similar to the laughter thing, but it's from Smooth Criminal.
4319400	4321400	The barbarian is blinded.
4322400	4323400	Okay.
4323400	4324400	Now I want to suck his dick.
4324400	4325400	No, no.
4327400	4329400	What kind of cockpit is this?
4333400	4335400	Properly named one.
4335400	4336400	I don't know.
4336400	4338400	What kind of cockpit is this?
4340400	4341400	No, I want to...
4341400	4342400	Okay, so now I got him dazed.
4342400	4343400	I got him dazed.
4343400	4344400	He's dazed.
4344400	4345400	He's off balance.
4345400	4346400	Okay, so now I want to...
4346400	4349400	You know, again, I want to sweep the leg.
4349400	4350400	I want to sweep the leg.
4351400	4354400	It's a bit difficult of a noob here, but you are wearing heavy armor.
4354400	4355400	Mm-hmm.
4355400	4356400	You sweep him.
4356400	4357400	Yeah, of course.
4358400	4360400	He falls to the front ground.
4360400	4365400	His raging barbarian mind can barely comprehend the horizontality of his body.
4373400	4377400	I want to open up a little door in my seat.
4377400	4381400	I then want to allow a fart to secrete.
4381400	4385400	I want to do it right on his face.
4385400	4388400	And it concentrates right in that one's face.
4388400	4389400	Halfling.
4389400	4390400	Are you okay?
4390400	4391400	Are you okay?
4391400	4392400	Are you okay, halfling?
4398400	4402400	I feel like my guy, even though he's dressed as well, I kind of want to make him more of
4402400	4403400	an imp, I guess.
4403400	4404400	That is what I'm getting at here.
4404400	4405400	You know he's doing a little playful thing.
4405400	4409400	I just want to scooch down, put my, like, I want to, like, put my, um...
4417400	4418400	Fart in the face.
4418400	4420400	Like, um, they would call it, in Halo, they call it tea bagging.
4420400	4422400	Yeah, yeah, tea bagging.
4422400	4424400	But this is, it's more, it's more, um...
4424400	4425400	With a cherry on top.
4425400	4426400	I assume it's a halfling.
4426400	4429400	He's half the size of a human being, but his senses are probably stronger, so it would,
4429400	4430400	I mean, that would do damage.
4431400	4432400	Roll him.
4432400	4434400	He is nauseated, although not damaged.
4434400	4435400	I'm crushing, okay.
4435400	4436400	Yeah, yeah.
4437400	4440400	Now I want to go through his iPod and make fun of the songs on it.
4443400	4444400	Alright, it's Dan's turn.
4444400	4447400	One song on his iPod, and let me see if I can riff on it.
4448400	4450400	Another Day in Paradise by Phil Collins.
4454400	4456400	Just Another Day in Paradise?
4456400	4458400	Yeah, yeah, Come Down Against Homeless People.
4460400	4461400	Let's see, let's see you do it.
4462400	4463400	It's a song about homeless people.
4463400	4464400	See you.
4464400	4465400	Yeah.
4467400	4469400	Well, he watched that guy die and didn't do anything about it,
4469400	4470400	except write a song about it.
4470400	4473400	So I don't know if he's really into anything you write songs about.
4475400	4479400	I would say, I would say, oh man, you know, I'm homeless, except for this ship.
4481400	4485400	And maybe just have like a genuine moment, like you try to have in Brooklyn, or space.
4487400	4488400	Are we in space?
4488400	4490400	I don't even know where the hell this game takes place.
4491400	4495400	We've been fighting this sci-fi people in Dungeons and Dragons world.
4495400	4496400	I love it.
4496400	4497400	Yeah.
4497400	4503400	No, I would just, I would, yeah, I want to, I just want to do a nice, you know, knock him out.
4503400	4506400	I want to take his, you know, I have a flashlight, I assume, right?
4506400	4507400	No.
4507400	4508400	Alright.
4508400	4509400	You have an axe, right?
4509400	4510400	Oh, right, I have the axe.
4510400	4511400	I want to hit him with the blunt side of the axe.
4511400	4512400	I don't want to chop off anything.
4512400	4515400	I just want to knock him out so I can deal maybe with the other two people that might be,
4515400	4517400	and try to get that squid off my folks.
4518400	4521400	So, okay, do you want to lift the squid or hit the guy?
4521400	4522400	Well, I got to, he's down.
4522400	4524400	Is he, how, where is he at for the count?
4524400	4525400	He's farted on.
4525400	4526400	Yeah.
4526400	4528400	He's slightly blinded.
4528400	4529400	Okay.
4529400	4531400	I got billiard ball on my face.
4531400	4533400	I'm on the ground because you swept my leg.
4533400	4534400	Yeah.
4534400	4536400	And to add insult to injury, you kind of farted on me.
4537400	4540400	Also, does the squid have kind eyes?
4540400	4542400	It has fiendish eyes.
4542400	4543400	He has what?
4543400	4544400	Fiendish.
4544400	4545400	Fiendish eyes.
4545400	4550400	You just let me know when I can cast Tasha's hideous laughter on this farting billiard guy.
4550400	4552400	Well, he's entitled to a will save.
4554400	4555400	He passes his will save.
4557400	4560400	I, I use, I use wild empathy on the squid.
4560400	4563400	He gives a meager chuckle, but he's unaffected.
4563400	4564400	Wild empathy.
4564400	4566400	What do you, okay, you can see the squid.
4566400	4567400	It's like, I'm confused.
4567400	4569400	So many vague pronouns.
4569400	4571400	Can my guys be named Dave?
4571400	4572400	Dave sees the thing.
4572400	4574400	Dave sees the thing.
4575400	4578400	Jeff just told me I, just, Jeff just told me I fucked up.
4578400	4579400	The squid's on our side, right?
4579400	4580400	Yeah.
4580400	4581400	Yeah.
4581400	4582400	So you wild empathize with the squid.
4582400	4585400	You realize it just got here from another plane.
4585400	4586400	It doesn't know what's up.
4586400	4588400	It fell on some people.
4588400	4589400	It can't breathe.
4589400	4591400	Can I say something else to him?
4591400	4592400	Yeah.
4592400	4593400	Yeah.
4593400	4594400	Like you're going to die.
4596400	4597400	What do you want to say?
4597400	4601400	When I say to the squid, hey, first of all, you look great.
4602400	4605400	Second of all, can you take care of us a little bit more?
4605400	4609400	It whips a tentacle around in protest.
4610400	4611400	Rude.
4611400	4613400	I have three people for you.
4613400	4614400	Yeah.
4614400	4615400	It's not bad.
4615400	4616400	Not bad.
4616400	4617400	Thanks, dad.
4619400	4621400	My dad hates me when he comes to every show.
4623400	4625400	A charm person.
4625400	4626400	Charm person.
4627400	4629400	He passed his will save.
4629400	4630400	It doesn't affect him.
4630400	4631400	God damn it.
4631400	4632400	Who are you?
4633400	4634400	At this point, it's quarter term.
4634400	4635400	I'm Dave.
4637400	4638400	All right.
4638400	4640400	So have I taken any hit points from that leg sweep?
4640400	4642400	No, you're just on the ground.
4642400	4644400	It'll take you a bit to get up.
4644400	4645400	All right.
4645400	4646400	I get up.
4646400	4647400	You leap to your feet.
4648400	4649400	You can't see points at all.
4649400	4651400	Well, well, well, look who's back.
4652400	4653400	Right?
4653400	4654400	Yeah.
4654400	4655400	Yeah, it's me.
4655400	4660400	I grab his I clasp hands with him like in Billy G or beat it.
4660400	4661400	Yeah.
4662400	4664400	And I throw you.
4664400	4666400	I have I have throwing knives.
4666400	4669400	I give him a throwing knife and I keep one for myself.
4669400	4670400	OK.
4670400	4673400	And we hold our hands together and we spin around in a circle.
4674400	4675400	I kind of like.
4685400	4687400	And then I leap in first.
4687400	4693400	Then I take my knife and a very ungentlemanly like a breach of contract.
4693400	4695400	I throw my knife at his face.
4698400	4700400	Your tricky move seems to get the better of him.
4700400	4701400	But does it hit?
4702400	4703400	Nope.
4703400	4704400	Shit.
4704400	4709400	The knife whizzes past the head and plants itself in the machinery behind him.
4709400	4710400	Who are you?
4715400	4719400	If I would have known you were going to be throwing knives, I wouldn't have shaved this morning.
4720400	4721400	My guy.
4722400	4723400	My guys.
4723400	4726400	The guys trapped under the squid are cracking up.
4728400	4730400	They love your antics.
4731400	4732400	Yeah.
4737400	4739400	Reduce person.
4739400	4740400	Oh, reduce person.
4740400	4742400	That's a classic.
4742400	4744400	Dan Harmon uses it constantly.
4745400	4746400	What?
4746400	4747400	No, I love him.
4747400	4748400	I love him.
4748400	4749400	Don't boo me.
4749400	4753400	You see the armored figure before you shrink down in a comical fashion.
4754400	4759400	Is this a private party or should you pick on someone your own days?
4761400	4764400	So you're about three feet tall now and a bit weaker.
4765400	4767400	I fire a single arrow.
4767400	4773400	I use all of my focus and also I'm really beautiful while I'm doing it.
4774400	4776400	At this point you've accrued many magical arrows.
4776400	4777400	So which one?
4777400	4780400	You got non-lethal arrows, good-lined arrows, sleep arrows.
4780400	4781400	You have this memorized?
4781400	4783400	I don't understand what's happening.
4783400	4784400	I'm a dungeon master.
4784400	4785400	Yes.
4785400	4786400	That's amazing.
4786400	4788400	That's amazing.
4789400	4792400	Oh, shit.
4792400	4794400	I'll take his high fives.
4794400	4796400	I'll take all of his high fives.
4796400	4797400	Yeah.
4797400	4799400	I stole them.
4799400	4800400	Yeah.
4800400	4802400	Yeah.
4802400	4803400	Give them half.
4803400	4806400	Give them half of the high fives.
4806400	4807400	Those are from those guys.
4807400	4808400	There you go.
4808400	4810400	Yeah.
4812400	4813400	All right.
4813400	4814400	So an arrow.
4814400	4815400	A lot of different arrows coming at me.
4815400	4816400	Yeah.
4816400	4819400	So I have a sleepy arrow and a...
4819400	4820400	A good arrow.
4820400	4821400	All right.
4821400	4824400	An arrow that's good for knocking people out but not killing them.
4824400	4825400	Okay.
4825400	4828400	And an arrow that lends itself well for shooting two arrows at once.
4832400	4834400	You should have fired that last time.
4834400	4839400	And just to clarify, I'm wearing armor that has little doors in its butthole area and like...
4841400	4843400	Did his armor shrink too or is he comically...
4843400	4845400	No, he's like a child in it now.
4845400	4846400	He's clumsy.
4846400	4847400	Oh, because I'm three feet.
4847400	4848400	Right.
4848400	4849400	Yeah.
4849400	4850400	But the armor is regular size.
4850400	4856400	Well, dear Spencer, I think I'm going to go ahead and do the two arrows.
4856400	4857400	Okay.
4859400	4861400	One of your arrows hits.
4861400	4863400	The other hits the squid.
4866400	4867400	What is your...
4871400	4872400	That's critical things.
4872400	4875400	Really quick, Spencer is really the best.
4875400	4878400	He's one of the kindest, coolest people ever.
4879400	4881400	The shoe has not dropped.
4881400	4882400	Spencer.
4882400	4883400	I don't know.
4883400	4887400	I needed some applause after the booing with shooting the squid and everything.
4890400	4891400	I didn't mean to shoot the squid.
4891400	4893400	That should be Jeff or Dave's turn.
4893400	4897400	I do a mysterious emerald dagger attack on Dave.
4897400	4899400	You use your mysterious emerald dagger.
4900400	4901400	You hit.
4903400	4906400	Suck on that sword.
4907400	4909400	Sword sucker.
4910400	4912400	You deal eight damage.
4913400	4914400	Not bad.
4914400	4915400	Not bad.
4915400	4916400	All right.
4917400	4919400	We got to kill Jason's a dick.
4919400	4920400	Yeah, you do.
4921400	4922400	You got to kill Dave.
4922400	4924400	I'd like to be left out of this.
4926400	4927400	So it's my turn.
4927400	4928400	It's your turn, Dave.
4928400	4929400	Okay.
4929400	4930400	And where am I standing?
4930400	4931400	I just got...
4931400	4932400	I'm standing.
4932400	4933400	You can't move around too well.
4933400	4934400	Where'd the arrow hit me?
4934400	4935400	The one arrow that hit?
4935400	4937400	I'd say it hit you in the clavicle.
4938400	4939400	Right in the clavicle.
4940400	4941400	See?
4941400	4942400	It's right in the bone.
4942400	4943400	Yeah.
4943400	4944400	All right.
4944400	4945400	So the chink in the armor.
4945400	4946400	That's a weird thing.
4946400	4947400	You're like having trouble breathing probably.
4947400	4949400	And then the then the emerald dagger comes at me.
4949400	4950400	And where is that?
4950400	4952400	That's going to hit you right in the stomach.
4952400	4956400	Even though it didn't hit your armor, you feel quite injured from the blow.
4956400	4957400	Yeah.
4957400	4958400	Yeah.
4958400	4959400	Knocked the wind out of me at least.
4960400	4961400	Okay.
4962400	4963400	Okay.
4964400	4967400	Well, at this point, I have no other option.
4967400	4968400	And what's going on?
4968400	4969400	The squid still got my three boys?
4969400	4970400	Like on lockdown?
4970400	4971400	Yeah.
4971400	4972400	They do.
4972400	4973400	Yeah.
4973400	4974400	Even though one of the arrows hit the squid, like three guys.
4974400	4975400	Three guys.
4975400	4976400	One squid.
4976400	4977400	Even if the squid was dead, it'd still be doing that.
4977400	4978400	Yeah.
4978400	4979400	Good point.
4979400	4980400	It's heavy.
4980400	4981400	Okay.
4981400	4982400	Heavy squid.
4982400	4983400	And they're over there.
4983400	4984400	I mean, they're struggling.
4984400	4985400	They're awake.
4985400	4986400	They can laugh at jokes, but they're also...
4986400	4987400	Okay.
4987400	4988400	Okay.
4988400	4991400	I mean, I know the ship better than these guys do.
4991400	4995400	So I got to say that what?
5000400	5002400	Why didn't we think of that?
5002400	5003400	No, I feel...
5008400	5009400	Live my own life.
5009400	5010400	Yeah.
5010400	5012400	Follow the beat of your own drummer, Dave.
5014400	5017400	I never knew D&D was as much like Price is Right.
5018400	5019400	I didn't know that element of it.
5019400	5020400	The kitty litter!
5020400	5021400	The kitty litter!
5026400	5027400	Go Ohio State!
5030400	5031400	Let's see.
5031400	5032400	I would like to...
5038400	5042400	I'd like to take off the headrest where I was captaining.
5042400	5043400	Yeah.
5043400	5044400	The headrest there.
5044400	5047400	If I hit that button, I pull it up, and I can get the two things, like you're having
5047400	5053400	a lot of cars, and use that as a weapon to go after Jeff.
5053400	5055400	Quick reminder, you do own it.
5055400	5056400	Oh, I have my axe.
5056400	5057400	You know what?
5057400	5059400	We're going to leave that thing where it is for now.
5061400	5065400	And I'm going to use the sharp side of the axe instead of the blunt side, like I missed
5065400	5066400	with earlier.
5066400	5070400	And I'm coming after next.
5070400	5072400	I'm going after everybody's next.
5072400	5073400	Who's next?
5073400	5074400	Who's next?
5074400	5075400	Pick a neck.
5075400	5077400	Pick up neck number one.
5077400	5079400	Well, that would be the dagger guy.
5079400	5080400	Okay.
5080400	5081400	That's me.
5081400	5082400	Bold move.
5082400	5083400	I know his name is Jeff, but I don't know if you're correct.
5083400	5084400	Quark.
5084400	5085400	Quark.
5085400	5086400	Quark.
5086400	5087400	Or your quark.
5087400	5088400	Quark.
5088400	5089400	This is my name.
5089400	5090400	Quark.
5090400	5092400	The axe strikes you right in the chest, but it pings off your armor.
5092400	5095400	Fuck you!
5095400	5097400	So I missed his neck?
5097400	5099400	No, you hit him right in the chest.
5099400	5101400	It was a bit low.
5101400	5102400	His neck was a bit low.
5102400	5103400	You're really short, right?
5103400	5104400	Oh, I'm really short, right?
5104400	5105400	Yeah.
5105400	5106400	You're used to swinging higher.
5106400	5107400	Why am I going for dicks?
5107400	5108400	I should have went for dicks.
5108400	5109400	Ankles.
5109400	5110400	Necks.
5110400	5111400	Obnoxious.
5111400	5113400	You don't think of these things when you're short.
5113400	5114400	The world's the same, but it's not.
5114400	5115400	It's different.
5115400	5120400	The squid is dead.
5120400	5127400	Ray of frost!
5127400	5145400	I'm going to cast a spell that you know I don't toss out lightly.
5145400	5148400	Ray of frost, motherfucker!
5148400	5151400	Ray of frost!
5151400	5153400	Sorry, sorry.
5153400	5154400	Sorry about that.
5154400	5155400	It hits him right in the eye.
5155400	5158400	His eyeball freezes over.
5158400	5165400	He takes three damage and loses the use of one eye.
5165400	5166400	That was a good shot.
5166400	5170400	I think for all that wrapping, it should have been better.
5170400	5174400	Three is the maximum damage Ray of Frost can heal.
5174400	5178400	It's a level zero spell.
5178400	5180400	Jesus, it comes out now.
5180400	5181400	It gets a theme song, though.
5181400	5182400	It gets a theme song?
5182400	5183400	Yeah.
5183400	5185400	That's the dilemma with Dungeons and Dragons.
5185400	5189400	The things they're most familiar with are the shittiest things.
5189400	5194400	That's not just Dungeons and Dragons.
5194400	5196400	That's every relationship.
5196400	5203400	A billion burgers sold.
5203400	5204400	Controversial.
5204400	5205400	McDonald's insult.
5205400	5206400	Controversial.
5206400	5209400	McDonald's slam.
5210400	5211400	Who's turn?
5211400	5212400	I put it at Moraine's.
5212400	5213400	Yeah.
5213400	5214400	All right.
5214400	5216400	So I go, I'm down an eye.
5216400	5218400	So my depth perception is nuts.
5218400	5221400	And with a sword, an axe, I'm in bad shape.
5221400	5222400	You're already shorter.
5222400	5223400	Yeah.
5223400	5224400	All right.
5224400	5229400	First I grab a quirk in Sharpie's hands and grip them.
5229400	5230400	Oh, my God.
5230400	5231400	This hippie shit.
5231400	5235400	As if to say, I got it.
5235400	5238400	And then I take an arrow, the good arrow.
5238400	5246400	I take the good arrow, and I shoot it at his other eye.
5246400	5249400	Critical hit.
5256400	5264400	Olivia Wilde, too pretty for anybody.
5264400	5266400	No, but pretty enough for you.
5266400	5267400	But a fucking angel.
5267400	5268400	You're dating a goddess.
5268400	5269400	I know.
5269400	5270400	It's really, yeah.
5270400	5272400	You're going to live forever or die immediately.
5272400	5274400	Who knows?
5274400	5276400	Well, he's blind now, right?
5276400	5277400	Oh, no, he's dead.
5277400	5278400	He's dead.
5278400	5279400	He's gone.
5281400	5285400	Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Spencer and the Dungeons
5285400	5286400	and Dragons.
5289400	5290400	Aaron McGathey.
5290400	5291400	Wow.
5291400	5294400	Also, Jason, stay on stage.
5295400	5296400	We're getting about that time.
5296400	5298400	Spencer, everybody, I'll get the character sheets.
5302400	5303400	Yeah, that was a goodie.
5303400	5304400	That was crazy.
5304400	5306400	Jason, I hope it's not weird later.
5306400	5309400	Spencer, I want to go through your browser history.
5309400	5311400	So fucking bad right now, brother.
5311400	5313400	I swear to God.
5314400	5316400	Aaron McGathey, everyone.
5320400	5321400	Tough on squids.
5322400	5323400	Tough on squids.
5325400	5328400	All right, Dan, we're getting about that time.
5328400	5332400	Maybe it's towards you, though, you know, for the final.
5333400	5334400	Not just yet, but...
5334400	5336400	Can I tell you a fantasy of mine?
5338400	5340400	It involves Olivia Wilde.
5341400	5342400	No, no, no.
5343400	5345400	I couldn't place her in a lineup.
5345400	5347400	I wish them the best.
5347400	5349400	You'd still pick her if you saw her.
5352400	5353400	That's not...
5355400	5357400	Wild, wild slam.
5358400	5360400	Fiancé slam.
5361400	5362400	Fiancé slam.
5362400	5363400	Chivalry slam.
5364400	5366400	People are tightly packed together, and I just want to...
5366400	5368400	Like, I could do it very carefully.
5368400	5370400	I'm sure they have a rule against it.
5370400	5371400	But if I just...
5371400	5372400	Like, if I...
5372400	5374400	Is there a dog paddle version of a stage dive?
5374400	5375400	Or you can just kind of like...
5375400	5377400	Just very carefully...
5377400	5379400	Very carefully do it.
5379400	5380400	Yeah, you can do this.
5380400	5381400	I'm 40 years old.
5381400	5382400	I just want to...
5382400	5383400	I'm 40.
5384400	5385400	I'm 40.
5387400	5388400	All right, let's...
5388400	5390400	I don't want anyone to...
5390400	5394400	Hang on, let me find the...
5395400	5397400	I'm not going to jump onto you.
5397400	5399400	It'll be like when you learn to swim.
5399400	5405400	But go backwards so people don't like, you know, inadvertently grab, you know, decking balls.
5405400	5408400	Keep in mind, he's been on a tour bus for about a week and a half right now.
5408400	5409400	There's a little...
5409400	5410400	Yeah, yeah, Joan.
5411400	5413400	Use one hand to cover your nose.
5413400	5415400	All right, here's the Dido Rihanna rap.
5415400	5417400	If you guys know the chorus.
5417400	5418400	Yo.
5418400	5419400	Yo.
5419400	5420400	Yo.
5420400	5421400	Yo.
5421400	5424400	Also, Jason, if you want to sing the hook, it'd be Dido for us.
5429400	5430400	Brooklyn, more like Brooklyn.
5430400	5431400	It's my home.
5431400	5434400	I want to go from place to place, home to home.
5434400	5439400	I want to fuck your mama so far in space that she comes back down and says,
5439400	5443400	You should give me some laces to put onto my shoes.
5443400	5447400	I know, I want to fuck your mama till her pussy turns to booze and then drink it.
5447400	5452400	Cup by cup, I fuck your mama so hard that she turns into a pop.
5453400	5455400	Come on down to haunted town.
5455400	5456400	Bad rap.
5457400	5458400	Upside down.
5458400	5459400	Bad rapping.
5459400	5461400	She is yellow, blue, and brown.
5461400	5462400	Yo.
5462400	5464400	Come on down to haunted town.
5464400	5467400	Going to do a low stakes, gentle stage dive.
5467400	5470400	Just going to go up to the edge and make it come alive.
5470400	5473400	Going to crawl like a little dog paddle.
5473400	5474400	Going to just go out there.
5474400	5476400	It's going to be like a raffle.
5476400	5478400	They're very, very careful.
5478400	5479400	They're very careful.
5479400	5481400	Everyone's going to be fine.
5481400	5483400	Everything's going to be fine.
5483400	5486400	Come on down to haunted town.
5486400	5488400	Turn your frown upside down.
5488400	5490400	Wait, I've got to go backwards.
5491400	5494400	Come on down to haunted town.
5494400	5495400	Space cosmos.
5495400	5497400	See a humanity.
5497400	5498400	Rocking Brooklyn.
5498400	5500400	I want to do reality.
5500400	5501400	Fuck your mama.
5501400	5502400	Fuck your daddy.
5502400	5503400	Fuck your dad.
5503400	5504400	Holy shit.
5504400	5506400	I feel like Saddam and Baghdad.
5506400	5507400	Worshiping me.
5507400	5509400	Worship my ass.
5509400	5510400	Who took my wallet?
5510400	5511400	Fuck you.
5511400	5512400	I'll be back for it.
5512400	5513400	Oh shit.
5513400	5514400	I love Brooklyn.
5514400	5515400	Oh shit.
5515400	5516400	New York, God damn it.
5516400	5517400	Do a stage dive.
5517400	5518400	Shit.
5518400	5519400	What do we do now?
5519400	5521400	Come on down to haunted town.
5521400	5522400	Take me back.
5522400	5524400	Turn your frown upside down.
5524400	5525400	Put me back.
5525400	5527400	Here we go.
5527400	5528400	Take me back.
5528400	5530400	Come on down to haunted town.
5530400	5531400	Oh shit.
5531400	5532400	Yeah.
5536400	5537400	Holy shit.
5537400	5540400	Dreams come true.
5540400	5543400	Dreams come true in Brooklyn.
5543400	5545400	Yeah.
5545400	5547400	You can just do that?
5547400	5548400	Yeah.
5548400	5550400	That's fucking amazing.
5550400	5556400	I always thought that was like a David Blaine thing where you had to look at a certain angle.
5556400	5558400	That was crazy.
5558400	5559400	All right.
5559400	5562400	That was a legitimate stage dive.
5562400	5563400	That was okay.
5563400	5564400	Yeah.
5564400	5567400	There's no asterisks next to that.
5567400	5569400	I don't want you like when people are like, did you ever stage dive?
5569400	5570400	And be like, well, yeah, kind of.
5570400	5572400	No, you did it.
5572400	5576400	I mean, I was being like, everyone should experience that.
5576400	5577400	Okay.
5577400	5578400	Everyone come up till 3 AM.
5578400	5579400	Everyone come up.
5579400	5580400	Line up here.
5580400	5581400	What happened to another?
5581400	5582400	It's like a trust exercise.
5582400	5583400	It's a $5 donation.
5583400	5584400	Everyone has to.
5584400	5585400	Everyone has to.
5585400	5586400	All right.
5586400	5588400	Jeff, we're tired of the rap.
5588400	5590400	Obviously, I'm getting worse and worse at the rap.
5590400	5592400	We wanted to try something different tonight in Brooklyn.
5592400	5596400	They call it Music City, Brooklyn.
5596400	5598400	The typewriter was invented here.
5598400	5599400	I don't know if you know that.
5599400	5601400	They called it the south of the north.
5601400	5605400	The sandwich was invented here.
5605400	5610400	Brooklyn famous for its hats and sandwiches.
5610400	5615400	But we want to try to end with like a gentler, like this new song.
5615400	5619400	Because this rap, this Dido Rihanna rap, we can continue to do it city to city.
5619400	5622400	We have a friend here that we should bring up before we do that.
5622400	5623400	Is Hervey here?
5623400	5624400	Our old buddy, Hervey.
5624400	5625400	Mark Hervey to the stage, please.
5625400	5627400	Mark Hervey, everybody.
5627400	5629400	Grab your six string.
5629400	5631400	And isn't there some dude who...
5631400	5633400	It will help.
5633400	5635400	You know, this is a stage dive in the opposite way.
5635400	5637400	This is a reverse Tootsie stage dive.
5637400	5638400	First, Mark.
5638400	5640400	Mark, we all met.
5640400	5644400	The reason why we're in New York and it was remiss to not bring one of our friends up.
5644400	5647400	I know Dan through a thing called Comedy Sports.
5647400	5648400	It's an improv thing.
5648400	5650400	Yeah, three of you.
5650400	5653400	I did it for the Los Angeles chapter.
5653400	5655400	You were Kansas City, Jason.
5655400	5656400	You bet is correct.
5656400	5657400	Dan was Milwaukee.
5657400	5658400	You were originally Madison, right?
5658400	5660400	Yeah, Madison.
5660400	5662400	And then I met you guys when you were the cool kids
5662400	5663400	from the New York thing.
5663400	5664400	And you were an awesome...
5664400	5665400	And now we're not.
5665400	5666400	No, you're not.
5666400	5668400	But you were an awesome sketch group called Burt Ferschner's,
5668400	5670400	which is the funniest fucking sketch show I've ever seen in my life.
5670400	5671400	I'll never forget it.
5671400	5674400	So, Mark, go find your axe back there.
5674400	5675400	We'll mic you up if we can.
