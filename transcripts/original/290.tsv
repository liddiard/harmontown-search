0	8680	Welcome to the Hayworth Theatre in the Dumbledore Tapestry, whatever the fuck this place is called,
8680	13600	in the prestigious heroin district of downtown Los Angeles.
13600	19760	We walk at you once again and it's always my absolute joy to say the words, Harmon Town
19760	21520	is now in session.
21520	29600	Thank you.
29600	33060	Everybody reach over and put your right hand in the lap of the person next to you and just
33060	39960	rub it around, except for church, then give it both hands.
39960	50600	Let's bring out our game master, Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
50600	56440	And once in a while a mayor is required, let's give it up for the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan
56440	57440	Harmon.
57440	58440	Thank you.
58440	59440	Harmon.
59440	60440	Thank you.
60440	61440	Thank you.
61440	62440	A gratitude rap.
62440	63440	I'm thankful for that.
63440	64440	A thank you.
64440	65440	All right.
65440	66440	That was it?
66440	85440	Yeah, sometimes, you know, I remember six degrees of separation, like the Donald Sutherland
85440	86440	House.
86440	93040	Great art is about knowing when to take the drawing away from the child.
93040	96680	Like people look at a Jackson Pollock and they go, I could do that.
96680	102040	You could, you could start to do it, but you'd keep doing it until you fucked it up.
102040	107480	Pollock got drunk, fell asleep, genius.
107480	111280	So you were feeling less pollicky or more pollicky about that rap?
111280	116440	Not feeling like on point about my Pollock curation in terms of myself, I was like, gratitude
116440	117440	rap.
117440	118440	And then I'm like, fuck it.
118440	119640	I'm not sure.
119640	127200	I'm not sure how comfortable I am as comptroller of how thin and well-shaven and your haircut.
127200	132360	Like you're looking, you're looking like the sexy version of Dan Harmon.
132360	133760	Thanks.
133760	135560	Thanks, guys.
136560	142320	Well, I mean, look, I, the paradox is always going to be that like all handsome people,
142320	146200	I don't care about looks anymore.
146200	148120	I'm over it.
148120	151920	How many abs do you think that you currently have?
151920	163400	You know, I think I have two standard abs that are dripping over my belt and then another
163400	168360	two backup retro abs that are actually my breasts.
168360	176360	I'm working on working on reducing them into maybe a more of an abdominal muscle.
176360	182120	I don't, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't changed my diet, which I do want to say to, you know,
182120	190480	my tribe, guys that look like me probably may be at the risk of offending.
190480	194680	So you, Russell Crowe.
194680	202680	You know, I'm sure I lead a sedentary pack of quote unquote alphas.
202680	203960	The quotes are theirs.
203960	205360	We're meta alphas.
205360	207200	We're very self-loathing.
207200	211360	Those quotes actually count as abs.
211360	213880	The air quotes are my fingers rippling.
213880	219400	We have purple tunnel from the air quotes when we flatter ourselves.
219400	224720	You could, we could hang from a doorway by our air quotes.
224720	226480	Nothing is sincere.
226480	228800	All is ironic.
228800	231320	But we're fat.
231320	235640	And I would just say to those guys, I'm not, I'm not mistaking myself for a fitness guru,
235640	243120	but I will say we always think diet and exercise and like diet seems like the easier thing
243120	249320	because it's like, oh, I don't eat a cheeseburger that's easier than do doing a sit-up.
249320	253840	And I will say from, I don't want to give bad advice, we're all dealt different genetic
253840	260600	cards and stuff, but I so far don't tell Dave Klein, I said this, my trainer slash fan that
260600	269080	I met at the drawing room and, um, is he here or is that just somebody, that was a, that
269080	276080	was a, that was a Kleinerlganger, um, double, double Kleiner, double Kleiner, double Kleiner.
276080	278120	We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll finding that up in post.
278120	279120	Yeah.
279120	282360	So this is only the West coast broadcast, if you're listening, we, we clean it up by
282360	283360	East coast.
283360	290360	We've removed De Niro, um, we had to be funnier three hours ago.
290360	294280	But I was, I was just going to say, just if you're curious, if you're like me and you're
294280	297440	like, well, I definitely don't want to do two things.
297440	300840	I don't want to exercise and I don't want to diet.
300840	305920	So I, I, I, like, I will say from my experience, it turns out, even though this wouldn't seem
305920	310040	this way, the exercise is the easier thing because if you do it, you can still eat like
310040	311040	shit.
311040	313800	Like I'm still eating like shit.
313800	317720	Like I was just in New York and I was just like inhaling, I just like, you know, blackout
317720	318720	drunk.
318720	319720	I looked at the photo roll.
319720	322360	I'm like, what, why did the police keep not arresting me?
322360	324360	Why are they taking pictures?
324360	325920	The, the, the, and who are these people?
325920	330360	This and that guy's pissed and oh, this guy's seem nice, but it's like, oh, that's urine.
331360	335960	I found a video of me peeing just somewhere in the darkness.
335960	337480	What does this have to do with your diet, Dan?
337480	339280	Well, guess what?
339280	343720	I didn't stop at the Albertsons and get kale on the way home.
343720	351080	I followed Fred Flintstone vapor trails of bronto burger cookouts and just wandered into
351080	356200	people's living rooms and ate turkey off of their table.
356200	361080	And so if you do that in 20 minutes on elliptical a day, you can, you can, you'll probably
361080	367600	die of like bad things, but you might, you'll lose more tummy than if you, what am I doing?
367600	369000	Harmon, stop.
369000	373400	I just thought it was an interesting fact because I never knew, I never knew it would
373400	375320	work that way.
375320	377880	Never tried exercising before in my life.
377880	378880	I really haven't.
378880	380320	It was, it was, it was called gym class.
380320	384200	That was where we were culled from the herd.
385200	391080	The rope and the, and the pull ups and the, the, even the square dancing, I don't know
391080	393000	if that was a bone they were throwing us.
393000	398520	Do you think that was maybe, was it, was, was the square dancing thing like give the people
398520	404760	that can't throw a ball a break, let them touch a girl before they become serial killers
404760	411760	or, or was it fuck these guys that can't throw a ball and are still going to sail through
411760	413840	the fire system?
413840	419040	I want to prove their monsters, make them touch girls, and I'm going to, I'm going
419040	420320	to, I'm going to bust them.
420320	423080	Was there actually a square dancing in Milwaukee or where?
423080	424080	Oh yeah.
424080	425080	For real.
425080	426080	That wasn't part of everybody.
426080	427760	Well, this is a generational thing too.
427760	432560	Who had square dancing by applause in there?
432560	438880	Did you, did you go to some school for the sexually confident or something?
438880	441880	Everyone had a suit and all the kids.
441880	442880	We did.
442880	443880	Kattillion.
443880	446160	Kattillion and everybody was, everybody was.
446160	449020	Your high school hallway looked like a ventriloquist act.
449020	450020	Yeah.
450020	454580	And the guys had to look like Louise Jordan and the women had to look like Audrey Hepburn.
454580	460540	And then you, there was a woman that had like castanets and she would teach us like how
460540	466320	to do like the Roomba and the Samba and like the merengue and shit like that.
466320	468240	Like this is, when's this going to come in handy?
468240	469680	It turns out it did.
469680	472400	Well, yeah, I mean, yeah.
472400	478880	You can, you can indirectly bully people on a podcast.
478880	480840	Learn the Samba.
480840	483320	So it wasn't choices that made you superior.
483320	484320	No, no.
484320	486960	It was your breeding.
486960	489240	It was being raised in Orange County.
489240	492440	Like they made you be fancy.
492440	493440	Privilege.
493440	496320	Well, you want to talk about privilege?
496320	498660	I do.
498660	501780	It profits me every time.
501780	508260	Can we talk about you hating being in first class in airports?
508260	514300	Because your tweets against the mint jet blue gave you a...
514300	516840	That was not a jet blue lounge.
516840	521820	That was a lounge in the jet blue terminal that you need a jet blue ticket to get into.
521820	522820	But they were very nice about it.
522820	524860	But you were, you're like, this is fucked up.
524860	529420	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm up in a lounge like a piece of shit.
530240	532640	You're talking shit about being in a first class lounge.
532640	534800	I put a positive spin on it too.
534800	539320	A lot of people said it was the, it was the best stuff they'd read in a long time.
539320	541480	I got a lot of compliments on that.
541480	542840	I really did.
542840	543880	And it made me proud.
543880	547840	I do like people telling me I enjoyed your tweets.
547840	552120	You know, I, it's like, you know, I will say thank you sometimes.
552120	559400	I won't just start getting in a tussle with the 17 year old dressed in a baggy suit.
559400	564260	Disguised with a freaking ink mustache he drew on his face.
564260	565260	You're a bad writer.
565260	567260	Kid, come on.
567260	572740	I'm not, I'm not great, but I'm like, you can't even say in a tweet that I'm a bad writer
572740	573940	without writing badly.
573940	580340	I know that you don't know, you do like adding all these syllables to sound like Frasier.
580340	581340	Like I, come on.
581340	582900	Like I'm not, I don't...
582900	586500	Is it somebody that works with jet blue or just a regular person?
586500	587500	No this is, I felt bad.
587600	590600	Yeah, JetBlue tweeted and said, that's not our lounge.
594600	596600	They disowned their lounge.
596600	598680	And you were very contrite about it.
598680	599680	You were very...
599680	600680	Because I love JetBlue.
600680	602840	They only fly back and forth from New York to L.A., right?
602840	603840	It's all it is.
603840	608000	It's like, for the rarefied, I'm sure, I don't know if people fly JetBlue coach and if you
608000	609600	hate your bad experience as a JetBlue coach.
609600	610600	I don't know.
610600	616320	I do want to say this, I realized this on the plane.
616420	619420	I dare to admire me, the...
619420	622420	Everybody buckle your admirer belts.
622420	623420	A lot of oligarchs.
623420	625420	Yeah, I'll say it.
625420	627420	I'm an oligarch.
627420	634420	I haven't looked it up yet, but it sounds appropriate.
634420	641420	We'll undercut our own position with our politics or, I'm sorry, we'll refuse to.
641420	645420	I'm a hero for, I forgot why I was admirable.
645520	651520	I don't care if my feeling about how things should work happens to point to me having
651520	653520	to give up some stuff.
653520	660520	For example, I realized on that plane, having had to do it, but also having been allowed
660520	665520	to do it, which I shouldn't have, that first class people should not be allowed to shit
665520	667520	and coach.
667520	669520	Okay.
669520	675020	If you're in first class and the captain's taken a shit, coach can't come up and take
675120	677120	a shit in first class.
677120	679120	Actually, they can.
679120	684120	If the curtain is halfway unbuttoned, that means you're allowed from coach to go up
684120	688120	into first and take a little first class poop.
688120	696120	If the curtain is halfway undone, that means the captain is like, oh no, it's when the
696120	698120	food is going down the back.
698120	700120	If the curtain is loose, the captain's...
700120	702120	In the caboose.
702220	706220	He's dropping a deuce, but I couldn't...
706220	711220	No, no, no, because if the flight attendants are bringing the food cart down the aisle,
711220	719220	nobody can go back down to the aft lavatory, so you are by law by the FFA to go up and
719220	721220	take a first class poop.
721220	723220	Okay.
723220	726220	If you're being blocked by the food cart.
726220	728220	Okay.
728320	730320	Maybe I don't feel...
730320	734320	Because I've been on planes so vast, so...
734320	737320	How vast were they?
737320	745320	I think that scene from Inception was shot on there where it turns out most of the movie
745320	750320	takes place on one level in that weird plane where there's a cafe and there's a bunch of
750320	754320	briefcases with hosed wheels in them.
754320	756320	Something like...
756420	759420	I never saw the movie, so I have no idea what you're talking about.
759420	763420	Or are you seeing it now without knowing it?
763420	765420	The trick isn't to get to see it.
765420	767420	To get you to see it.
767420	769420	The trick is to convince you you've seen it.
769420	773420	I'm taking a poop in the lobby right now and nobody knows that.
773420	780420	I've been yelled at for being in first class and taking a poop in, like, platinum class.
780420	782420	Like, I had a guy...
782420	784420	I got up, took a poop, walked...
784520	786520	What was this dude?
786520	788520	Walked forward ten feet and took a poop.
788520	790520	And then as I was coming out...
790520	799520	A fucking dude followed me back to my seat and then played the airline like in a little uniform.
799520	803520	Like, which meant he was waiting for me to finish pooping.
803520	807520	And then he followed me and was like,
807520	809520	Excuse me, sir.
809520	811520	You're not supposed to use the bathroom in there.
811520	813520	And I was like...
813520	815520	Yeah, so he said, that's platinum class.
815520	821520	And I said, well, it's a blue collar poop so it doesn't really matter.
821520	825520	I didn't say that. I'm a coward.
825520	830520	Wait, there's a platinum blue collar poop area but you didn't use it.
830520	832520	I somehow passed it.
832520	837520	I guess there was a Hogwarts pillar at a train station that you could...
838520	840520	It's just like disguised more.
840520	845520	It's like more worked into the turn the coffee pot and then there's like a bathroom.
845520	846520	I just passed it.
846520	848520	Just because I'm used to the geography of it, I'm like,
848520	851520	The bathroom's gonna be as far as you can walk and then you hang a yo.
851520	853520	Right.
853520	855520	And then you do your thing.
855520	858520	But I didn't know that like four stockbrokers were like...
862520	866520	Did that millionaire just put his ass...
868520	871520	on our billionaire toilet?
871520	878520	And fill it with whatever fucking high quality vegan bakery
878520	881520	that he didn't even have to eat?
882520	887520	Did I tell you, I was in San Francisco and I was flying back to LA first class
887520	894520	and the San Francisco Giants had just won the World Series while we were in the airport.
894520	899520	So everybody bought everybody a fernet bronca and a like Angers team.
899520	903520	So I had 90 drinks and I got on the plane, sat down and go,
903520	906520	Oh shit, I have to barf.
906520	907520	I have to barf.
907520	908520	Have we talked about this before?
908520	909520	I think you've mentioned it.
909520	910520	Yeah, you went back.
910520	912520	Yeah, and I went back and put all over my shoes,
912520	914520	but I didn't do it in the fucking front one
914520	918520	because that's where the people that fly the goddamn thing are gonna have to be.
918520	922520	So I went in the back and I was persona non grata.
922520	928520	I was a bad guy because it took me 30 minutes to clean up after what I fucking did.
928520	931520	I was lucky that I had a little stealth bomber back this time.
931520	934520	Coach, as we all know, everyone's gonna look at me anyway,
934520	936520	even if it's not my poop, they'll all look at me.
936520	940520	But luckily, it was just like...
940520	949520	I'm six foot four almost and I'm tall and the back laboratories are very short
949520	955520	and I couldn't get down close enough to the thing to successfully puke it.
955520	956520	Yeah, I don't know how you would do that.
956520	960520	So I just basically just leaned my head over
960520	966520	and vomited a gallon of Fernet Bronca and Acres team all over the whole building.
966520	968520	And then people were,
968520	970520	Hey, whoa, what's up?
970520	974520	And they knew that I was just fucking from first class.
974520	978520	I was like, yeah, you don't wanna be in here right now.
978520	980520	Hey, Spencer, how's it going over there?
980520	982520	Hey, guys, Chef Kevin here.
982520	985520	I like it without the blanket.
985520	990520	I thought it was funny with the blanket, but the desk, it's very...
990520	997520	Are your desks gonna get more and more elaborate as this show goes on?
997520	1002520	I'm gonna keep adding drawers and the opening.
1002520	1007520	Are you just gonna be like the king speech at some point and write a whole thing?
1007520	1011520	I'm gonna be like the king speech at some point.
1011520	1013520	I hope you know that at the end of this mystery,
1013520	1016520	we're not gonna be surprised that you were the ghost.
1016520	1018520	Yeah.
1018520	1022520	You're the only one that was here when our van broke down.
1022520	1026520	Obviously, you're here looking for the gold and using projectors and...
1026520	1031520	Yeah, you're right that now no one is going to be surprised.
1031520	1033520	Why? I'm the fancy guy.
1033520	1035520	Why don't I have candles up here?
1035520	1037520	You want some of my candles, man?
1037520	1040520	No, I don't want any of your candles.
1040520	1042520	I want you to have all the candles.
1042520	1043520	Thank you.
1043520	1046520	Just one more thing about JetBlue and I wanted to bring on our guest.
1046520	1049520	Because I like them and I want to praise them for their...
1049520	1051520	Because all the people are always friendly and they're always...
1051520	1053520	Look, I'm biased and this doesn't make people good,
1053520	1057520	but there's an overwhelming percentage of JetBlue flight attendants
1057520	1060520	that recognize me and say that they like my work.
1061520	1064520	Sorry, but that makes you a good airline in my book.
1064520	1070520	And I have that rapport then with them because I feel like,
1070520	1076520	well, now they know they like me so now I can be gregarious and it's just fun.
1076520	1081520	And they do the thing where they put the cart in front of the thing
1081520	1084520	because the bathroom captain's got it.
1084520	1088520	And I got up to use the bathroom and the flight attendants are leaving the thing
1088520	1092520	and they look and they go, oh, and I go, oh, captain taking a deuce.
1092520	1095520	And they're like, yeah.
1095520	1097520	It just feels more sincere and honest.
1097520	1099520	They're like, it's okay, he can say it.
1099520	1104520	I bet if I was a welder, they'd be like, I think you mean he's shitting.
1105520	1109520	Let's bring on our guest, Judd Apatow!
1118520	1130520	Well, we'll never know how funny my bit was going to be introducing Judd Apatow.
1130520	1133520	Judd, Judd, Judd, go back.
1133520	1134520	We're going to do a read.
1134520	1135520	We're going to do a read.
1135520	1136520	All right.
1136520	1139520	So Dan, yeah, yeah, JetBlue.
1139520	1140520	It's not the best.
1140520	1141520	It's not the worst.
1141520	1143520	But anyways, enough about me.
1143520	1145520	I'm tired of hearing myself talk.
1145520	1150520	When I started this podcast, it was all about me.
1150520	1155520	But then I thought, what about the voices we don't get to hear?
1155520	1160520	And it was then that I've decided to start using my podcast as a signal boost
1160520	1163520	for the unheard voices of America.
1163520	1166520	Please welcome Judd Apatow.
1176520	1177520	Thank you.
1177520	1179520	Pretty funny intro.
1181520	1182520	They went for it.
1182520	1183520	You'll edit out the first part?
1183520	1185520	We're going to have to.
1185520	1186520	Yeah, I guess.
1186520	1187520	Well, you know, I think we...
1187520	1188520	No, no.
1188520	1192520	What Judd, you don't know, is we're going to do four more iterations of this.
1193520	1195520	This is the whole time you're on stage.
1195520	1197520	This show's heavily edited, right?
1197520	1198520	Yeah, yeah.
1198520	1201520	I panicked when you arrived in the green room and you were like,
1201520	1202520	so what's the plan?
1202520	1204520	And I was like, uh-oh.
1206520	1207520	Uh-oh.
1207520	1210520	How come you get a stand for your microphone?
1210520	1211520	Oh, yeah.
1211520	1214520	Yeah, where is Schwab's weird lectern that we had last time?
1214520	1216520	What if my arms are tired?
1217520	1218520	There's one?
1218520	1223520	That's a power move to have your own stand and deny it to your guests.
1225520	1227520	There's one over there, but it's actually...
1227520	1232520	Now that I've donated mine, it's not only did I get to High Road,
1232520	1234520	but it's actually better not to have one.
1235520	1236520	That thing is...
1236520	1237520	Do you feel powerful?
1237520	1238520	I don't need it either.
1238520	1239520	Let's go standless.
1246520	1248520	How many pianos are there?
1251520	1254520	Seems like a complicated way to hold a microphone.
1254520	1257520	And you know the real irony, zero typewriters.
1259520	1261520	No, there's one typewriter.
1262520	1265520	Wait, he's got a stand too.
1274520	1275520	And we don't even want him.
1275520	1277520	He's right here the whole time.
1277520	1278520	And you move the piano.
1285520	1286520	I hate them.
1286520	1287520	I hate stands.
1288520	1290520	I never realized how insulting they are.
1290520	1292520	Like, oh, can I hold that for you?
1292520	1293520	No, no.
1295520	1296520	Thank you for...
1296520	1297520	That was so much...
1297520	1298520	The drink holder.
1298520	1299520	Thank you for the drink holder.
1301520	1303520	Do you play a little piano, Judd?
1304520	1305520	I only know one thing.
1305520	1306520	Here we go.
1306520	1307520	Lay it on us.
1311520	1312520	Yeah!
1313520	1321520	Now, within the category of people that learned anything on piano, that's lazy.
1322520	1323520	Because you stopped.
1323520	1327520	That's like stopping shaving a haircut and never learning two bits.
1332520	1333520	Okay.
1333520	1334520	He just...
1334520	1335520	But he was improvising.
1335520	1336520	I figured that out.
1336520	1337520	He inverted the first part.
1338520	1340520	Back when he was eight, his mom was like, Judd, if you...
1340520	1341520	No, mom!
1341520	1342520	It's hard!
1342520	1343520	I'm just tired of it.
1343520	1344520	You just wanted a microphone stand.
1344520	1347520	I think you wanted, like, a piece of furniture.
1347520	1349520	That could have saved me a whole lot of calories.
1350520	1352520	Well, you did get him a piece of furniture.
1353520	1356520	You're just like a Victorian lord over there.
1357520	1358520	Oh, yeah.
1359520	1360520	This desk is outstanding.
1360520	1362520	Well, I'll start by asking probably...
1362520	1364520	It might be a question you've been asked before.
1364520	1366520	Can everyone in the building have a job?
1366520	1367520	Yes, yes.
1368520	1370520	Do you have to...
1370520	1375520	It's like, oh, is your interview going to be about what it's like to be famous?
1376520	1377520	Is that...
1377520	1378520	Is that...
1378520	1379520	Does that something that worries you?
1379520	1380520	What it's like to be famous?
1380520	1383520	No, to be interviewed by somebody that's just going to do that instead of...
1384520	1389520	Like talking about you as if you're an inhuman demagogue and, like, wondering...
1389520	1392520	Are you asking, like, what's it like and are there...
1392520	1393520	No, I like it.
1393520	1394520	I like it.
1394520	1395520	Okay, okay.
1395520	1399520	In the novel of fame, I was just like, I was at Disneyland and somebody said to me,
1399520	1402520	they said, you know, if someone asks for your autograph at Disneyland,
1402520	1407520	they will send security over and they will let you cut the lines the rest of the day.
1408520	1412520	You know, so it's like Tom Hanks goes, it's a security problem if people start asking for autographs.
1412520	1413520	All right.
1413520	1415520	So I think it's a two people ask for your autograph,
1415520	1419520	security will walk you around the rest of the day and let you cut the lines.
1419520	1423520	So the next time I went to Disneyland, I wore a 40-year-old virgin T-shirt.
1425520	1428520	And I did not get asked for an autograph one time.
1428520	1430520	I was looking in people's eyes.
1430520	1436520	So you may have a dysmorphia about my level of success and awareness.
1436520	1441520	That is an insane, distracting policy on their part.
1441520	1446520	I mean, like, how does that make you feel when you hear that?
1446520	1448520	That fills me with panic.
1448520	1451520	Oh, it makes me so happy because then I figured out how to crack the code,
1451520	1453520	which is I bring my wife.
1453520	1454520	Right, that's one person.
1454520	1457520	And then it's easier, but it doesn't work solo for me.
1457520	1461520	How do you verify that you have to walk up to somebody that's an employee there and say,
1461520	1463520	hello, my name is Judd Apatow.
1463520	1465520	I've been asked for two autographs.
1467520	1468520	You have to break up.
1468520	1470520	I'm in a real hurry.
1470520	1473520	You have to be the lamest person in the world to do it.
1473520	1475520	But when you're cutting the lines, it's so worth it.
1475520	1477520	Like every second of it is worth it.
1477520	1480520	I mean, we'd almost do anything to cut a line, I would imagine,
1480520	1483520	but that's why it's like...
1484520	1487520	Because people go in wheelchairs, they put on fake casts,
1487520	1489520	and go in wheelchairs to cut lines.
1489520	1491520	So you've got to do what you've got to do.
1491520	1492520	You know what's cool now?
1492520	1498520	Because I'm not famous, but I am occasionally on Whose Line Is It Anyway.
1498520	1502520	Everybody that works at Disneyland is 24.
1502520	1504520	They all are theater kids.
1504520	1507520	They all took an improv class.
1507520	1509520	So church, my girlfriend and I, we went there,
1509520	1512520	and we were way more famous than you there.
1513520	1518520	Well, there are certain spaces where you're famous,
1518520	1521520	but only in that room.
1521520	1522520	Yeah, it was good.
1522520	1525520	But that's going to stop in three years,
1525520	1527520	because they're all going to be too old,
1527520	1529520	and no one's going to know who the fuck I am.
1529520	1531520	But they're going to know who you are.
1531520	1533520	But you have to wear the right shirt.
1533520	1536520	I have to wear a 40-old version T-shirt.
1536520	1541520	I'm impressed that it's not an out of swarm,
1541520	1542520	because my panic...
1542520	1545520	I would imagine life in your shoes would be like,
1545520	1550520	well, it's that can I have a job thing?
1550520	1556520	Your brand is that you can give people movies.
1558520	1560520	It just seems kind of dangerous.
1560520	1561520	I'm only famous for...
1561520	1564520	He might yell at you if he's drunk.
1565520	1569520	But to be kind of...
1569520	1572520	That's part of your brand.
1572520	1577520	That would be not only an invitation for a lot of...
1577520	1581520	kinds of conversations that would make me very anxious.
1581520	1584520	Well, Sundance is a bad place for me to go,
1584520	1586520	because if I walk up and down the street in Sundance
1586520	1589520	and everyone's just looking for anyone who makes movies,
1589520	1593520	they spot you, and now they hand you memory sticks,
1593520	1595520	which have a screenplay on them,
1595520	1598520	which you really can't put a strange memory stick
1598520	1600520	into your computer.
1600520	1602520	That could be anything, really.
1602520	1604520	That might be anything.
1604520	1607520	That might be something awful that goes into your computer.
1607520	1609520	I've told the story of this podcast before,
1609520	1614520	but I did a panel and a girl came up and she said,
1614520	1618520	Mr. Harmon, I am such an admirer of your work.
1618520	1619520	Do you think...
1619520	1621520	Can I please...
1621520	1624520	I know this is crazy, but I just always wanted to be a writer,
1624520	1628520	and you're a role model to me,
1628520	1633520	and it would just mean a lot if you would sign my screenplay,
1633520	1636520	and I'm like, oh, you know, probably.
1636520	1640520	Of course I'll do this thing that you're telling me is crazy.
1640520	1642520	So I take it and I sign it, and she just goes,
1642520	1646520	and if you could read it, that would be great, and walked away.
1646520	1648520	Now, do you ever, for the hell of it,
1648520	1650520	read a stranger's screenplay?
1650520	1652520	Like, would you ever just read that?
1652520	1655520	I had to open that one because my religion dictated
1655520	1657520	that I needed that girl to be a bad writer.
1657520	1659520	Didn't that?
1659520	1662520	Because what if she's good, and I just throw it in the garbage
1662520	1666520	because I felt like, how dare she?
1666520	1668520	So I was like, no, I have to fucking read it,
1668520	1669520	and I'm like three pages in it.
1669520	1672520	I'm like, yeah, that's pretty sweaty.
1672520	1677520	Judd, how did Camille and Emily come to you with the big sec?
1677520	1679520	Were you pals with him before that?
1679520	1680520	Well, no, not at all.
1680520	1684520	I went to Atlanta, no, not Atlanta, Austin.
1684520	1687520	Haven't seen it.
1687520	1688520	It's very good.
1688520	1691520	To show the first episode of Girls,
1691520	1696520	and Dave Rath, who is the manager for Pete Holmes,
1696520	1698520	said, will you do Pete Holmes' podcast?
1698520	1702520	And I said, who's Pete Holmes?
1702520	1704520	Pete Holmes popped out of a bush and went,
1704520	1708520	he's an experience.
1708520	1711520	I love Pete Holmes.
1711520	1713520	But at the time, I wasn't doing stand-up,
1713520	1715520	and I didn't really know who anybody was.
1715520	1717520	I was really out of the loop.
1717520	1721520	And so I showed up, and Pete Holmes was interviewing Camille
1721520	1726520	and Chris Gethard and I think Todd Barry.
1726520	1727520	I love Todd.
1727520	1728520	He's great.
1728520	1730520	We met on stage, and then it was just really weird
1730520	1737520	that over the next few years, I produced Chris' one-man show,
1737520	1742520	and then I'm now working with Pete on Crashing
1742520	1743520	and worked with Camille.
1743520	1747520	So it was the most productive podcast of all time.
1747520	1750520	And then he came in and he pitched me this crazy story
1750520	1755520	about Emily and the coma and all of it.
1755520	1758520	And I just thought, no one has a story that good.
1759520	1761520	No one's anecdote of their life.
1761520	1765520	Yeah, it's just dark enough, too, because it makes you have to wonder,
1765520	1768520	well, if I had one date and then...
1768520	1774520	It's like a thing that feels just a little too dark to make jokes about
1774520	1777520	or that you don't want to go there, which is always a good thing.
1777520	1780520	And he said, I fell in love with her while she was in the coma.
1780520	1783520	And I thought, well, that seems like a good movie,
1783520	1785520	but at the time, I didn't really even know Camille.
1785520	1787520	But I thought, this is a great idea.
1787520	1790520	Does anybody really know Camille?
1790520	1792520	You can't know Camille.
1794520	1797520	You can only know my horrible impression of him.
1798520	1800520	Whoa, I've never heard one of those.
1800520	1801520	That's pretty good.
1801520	1803520	I worked with him for four years.
1803520	1804520	I don't even have any impression.
1804520	1806520	I cannot do a Camille impression.
1806520	1807520	You know how every...
1807520	1810520	If you're a bad impression of Sir James Adomian,
1810520	1813520	it has a different fucking process than me for his impressions.
1814520	1819520	But if you don't do impressions but you want to try to do one,
1819520	1824520	there's a phrase or a word that gets you started.
1824520	1828520	For Camille, it's cunt because that's how he says can't.
1831520	1833520	That's funny.
1833520	1835520	What did you call me?
1836520	1838520	I'd like to hear an extended Camille impression.
1838520	1839520	Can you keep going?
1839520	1841520	No, I don't want to because it's...
1841520	1844520	If it drifts in and out of the fucking language.
1844520	1848520	A Burger King drive-through and try to order something as Camille,
1848520	1850520	but you cannot use the word cunt.
1852520	1854520	You have to use every word about that.
1854520	1858520	Now, you have given people opportunities that changed their life.
1858520	1860520	I don't know about that.
1863520	1865520	It doesn't look like a changed life, but...
1865520	1868520	I'm still working at the Apple Store.
1869520	1874520	This used to be an Apple Store, but it was pretty much...
1875520	1880520	His desk wasn't always an Edwardian, beautifully enameled desk.
1880520	1882520	He's really moved up.
1885520	1889520	How much of you pays that forward because, as we were discussing backstage,
1889520	1891520	your term was the patient zero I was using.
1891520	1894520	Neither of these phrases are going to be flattering to him,
1894520	1897520	but Ben Stiller is like, you call them the patient zero,
1897520	1899520	I call them the Lestat.
1901520	1907520	Ben, let's use the term very loosely because you're a self-starter
1907520	1911520	and he discovered, plucked you, whatever phrase you want to use.
1911520	1915520	Ben grabbed you and it was the Ben Stiller show.
1915520	1919520	What was your title on that? Were you EP?
1919520	1923520	No, I was the executive producer, but that was just a funny moment in time.
1924520	1928520	My main job then was I was writing HBO specials for Tom Arnold,
1928520	1931520	and I wrote Roseanne's act with her for a year,
1931520	1934520	and I was doing a lot of stand-up specials.
1934520	1936520	Did you write the Tom Arnold special where he does the,
1936520	1940520	my big penis, my big penis.
1940520	1942520	Was that a stand-up special?
1942520	1948520	It was like a pre-taped sketch that was part of a special.
1948520	1950520	It could be.
1950520	1952520	To the tune of My Shirona.
1952520	1954520	My big penis.
1956520	1957520	My shirona.
1957520	1959520	I'm not delivering it right.
1959520	1961520	There were two things that no one remembers at all.
1961520	1963520	There were three Tom Arnold specials.
1963520	1967520	There'd be a sketch and then it would turn into a piece of Tom trying to solve a problem,
1967520	1970520	almost like a reality comedy piece.
1970520	1972520	It was called Tom Arnold the Naked Truth.
1972520	1974520	How many people saw one of those?
1974520	1976520	Oh, damn.
1976520	1977520	Two people.
1977520	1980520	This is how fast the culture discards greatness.
1980520	1982520	Yeah.
1982520	1986520	Well, comedy doesn't age well, but also old people.
1986520	1988520	I mean, it's been a while.
1988520	1990520	Old people age great.
1990520	1992520	That's their main thing.
1992520	1994520	You know why it's weird is I always think,
1994520	1998520	like that was 26, 27 years ago.
1998520	2000520	What was the bits?
2000520	2002520	What would I remember after that?
2002520	2004520	Well, we went to the mall and Chris Farley,
2004520	2006520	there was a piece about how to pick up women,
2006520	2010520	we shot Chris Farley walking around the mall hitting on strangers,
2010520	2012520	like with the hidden cameras.
2012520	2014520	No one knew who Chris Farley was.
2014520	2016520	So actual, like candid cameras?
2016520	2018520	That's what one of the bits was.
2018520	2020520	What was it on?
2020520	2022520	It was on HBO.
2022520	2024520	But I always look at it like this.
2024520	2032520	When I was a kid, in 1977, 27 years earlier, was 1950.
2033520	2039520	So from the Ben Stiller show, from here is 1950.
2039520	2040520	Right.
2040520	2041520	Yeah, I know.
2041520	2043520	It's crazy when you realize that.
2043520	2049520	I keep thinking, well, Mr. Show is the most recent good sketch show.
2049520	2051520	No, we're all dying.
2051520	2055520	I hung out with Mark McKinney in New York,
2055520	2060520	and I was like, why do you look so good?
2060520	2062520	And it was like, oh, because we've gotten so old
2062520	2064520	that he's now injured a second phase of his life
2064520	2068520	where now he's a handsome old man.
2068520	2070520	I hope he doesn't hear that.
2070520	2076520	But it's like, some of our peers are getting handsome again.
2076520	2079520	It's been so long, and we're so close to death.
2079520	2081520	Yeah, there are.
2081520	2087520	I've recently become kind of palsy with Feig.
2087520	2089520	Yeah, and you dress like Paul Feig.
2089520	2090520	No, he dresses better.
2090520	2091520	Yes.
2091520	2092520	Because he has more money.
2092520	2094520	Because Paul Feig did not used to wear suits all the time.
2094520	2096520	He used to wear bowling shirts all the time.
2096520	2097520	Yes, he did.
2097520	2099520	And on a dime, he went suit.
2099520	2100520	Yeah.
2100520	2101520	Just on a dime, like, by the way,
2101520	2103520	starting tomorrow, I will wear a suit every day
2103520	2104520	for the rest of my life.
2104520	2106520	I was chatting to my girlfriend,
2106520	2108520	like, if we had all the money in the world,
2108520	2111520	we would just dress like fancy at all times
2111520	2113520	and like bespoke shit.
2113520	2114520	But Paul does.
2114520	2117520	Like, Paul really has bespoke shoes and suits.
2117520	2118520	Yeah.
2118520	2121520	And I went the other way, which is about three years ago,
2121520	2124520	I decided that every day of my life,
2124520	2129520	I would wear a black James Purse polo shirt.
2129520	2131520	Forever?
2131520	2135520	I just kept wearing Rick and Wordie shirts
2135520	2137520	until there were so many people watching it,
2137520	2143520	that 20% of the people were Nazis, and then...
2143520	2145520	Because it's a good show that's loved by a lot
2145520	2147520	of really wonderful people.
2147520	2149520	There's good people on both sides.
2149520	2153520	But I know it's like, I can't...
2153520	2156520	It really wasn't because of that.
2156520	2157520	I'm being glib.
2157520	2159520	But it was because, actually, oh,
2159520	2161520	the show's become so popular that I don't want to look
2161520	2165520	like I'm doing the 40 t-shirt thing.
2165520	2167520	Well, you weren't at Disneyland.
2167520	2169520	I'm just rotating between three Henleys
2169520	2171520	because I finally found out Henleys are slimming.
2171520	2172520	That's it.
2172520	2174520	But this is what we do,
2174520	2176520	because we don't want to exercise,
2176520	2178520	we don't really want to eat well,
2178520	2180520	and we're just searching for a shirt
2180520	2182520	that makes us look kind of shitty.
2182520	2184520	Yeah.
2184520	2186520	This is 45 and 50.
2186520	2188520	I want to go backwards, because...
2188520	2191520	The show's brought to you by men's rights activists.
2197520	2200520	Let's rewind just a little bit before Ben's...
2200520	2203520	Because I didn't know that,
2203520	2205520	so my imagining was like...
2205520	2207520	I was picturing Ben plucking you from like...
2207520	2209520	I think you started...
2209520	2211520	When you were in high school,
2211520	2213520	your mom was working at a...
2213520	2216520	Gee, Dan, did you read his Wikipedia page?
2216520	2218520	Your mom was working at a comedy club?
2218520	2220520	Yeah, my parents got divorced,
2220520	2222520	so my mom was seating people at a comedy club
2222520	2224520	because my parents used to own a restaurant,
2224520	2226520	and the guy was the bartender,
2226520	2229520	who went on to become a big manager of the...
2229520	2231520	Tim Allen and Drew Carey, this guy, Rick Messina.
2232520	2233520	It was Rick?
2233520	2235520	It was Rick, and he opened a comedy club on Long Island,
2235520	2238520	so in the aftermath of this terrible divorce,
2238520	2240520	my mom, who's broke,
2240520	2243520	she was seating people at a comedy club,
2243520	2247520	and so that was maybe 1982 or something.
2247520	2249520	How old were you?
2249520	2252520	I was 15 or 14.
2252520	2254520	It's kind of like...
2254520	2256520	There's kids these days that would be a podcast now,
2256520	2259520	but there's that archetype where it's like...
2259520	2262520	There's the mogul that pays it back,
2262520	2264520	and then there's the...
2264520	2268520	But you started as that self-start and precocious guy
2268520	2270520	who, through your mom's job,
2270520	2274520	you were getting headliners to come and do your interview show
2274520	2276520	that you did for, what, AV Club in high school?
2276520	2278520	For a high school radio station
2278520	2280520	that really didn't even get out of the parking lot.
2280520	2282520	Because what happened is,
2282520	2284520	I went to see all the comedy shows all summer,
2284520	2286520	and it was like Paul Provenza and Jay Leno
2286520	2287520	and people like that,
2287520	2289520	and I just, in my little teenage head,
2289520	2291520	I thought, I need to meet them.
2291520	2292520	How can I meet them?
2292520	2294520	And I had a friend who used to interview rock bands,
2294520	2296520	like REM, like when they first started
2296520	2297520	for the high school radio station,
2297520	2298520	and he's like,
2298520	2300520	maybe you could start a show where you interview comics,
2300520	2302520	and that'll be an excuse to call them,
2302520	2304520	and then I would call them,
2304520	2307520	and the first interview I did was Steve Allen,
2307520	2309520	and I show up.
2309520	2310520	I didn't have a tape recorder.
2310520	2314520	I literally brought a boombox
2314520	2315520	that had a record function,
2315520	2317520	and I put the boombox on the table
2317520	2318520	and pressed record.
2318520	2320520	Was it very sober with you?
2320520	2322520	Yeah, at that one.
2322520	2326520	And so that was the beginning of it.
2326520	2328520	But that was like, there were no podcasts.
2328520	2332520	There was no way to know what anyone thought about anything,
2332520	2333520	and in my head, I'm like,
2333520	2335520	I wish I could talk to Harold Ramis
2335520	2337520	and ask him about that stuff.
2337520	2338520	But it was still an archetype
2338520	2340520	that kind of transcends technology,
2340520	2342520	because now that kid would have a podcast,
2342520	2344520	but there's an archetype there.
2344520	2347520	Like, the kid, the precocious kid, who's like,
2347520	2350520	please, sir, I'm just interested in your funny comedy,
2350520	2353520	and the people getting a kick out of like,
2353520	2355520	well, I'd be a pretty good person
2355520	2357520	for being on this kid's show
2357520	2359520	and treating him like an equal,
2359520	2362520	and I just proved I was a great guy.
2362520	2365520	Like, I've done that for a certain podcast,
2365520	2367520	and like, do you...
2367520	2368520	Never.
2368520	2370520	If people ask me to do it, I never do it.
2370520	2372520	The kid's like, you did it,
2372520	2373520	and I'm just like, fuck off.
2373520	2374520	I don't know, I don't know.
2374520	2377520	So the kind of baptismal moment is Ben Stiller
2377520	2380520	doing what he also did for me in Schwab
2380520	2383520	and what he's done for so many
2383520	2386520	that it's kind of crazy that if he wasn't also Ben Stiller
2386520	2388520	and therefore interesting in different ways,
2388520	2391520	it would be a naturally very interesting thing about him
2391520	2394520	that he sees...
2394520	2395520	He has great taste.
2395520	2397520	Yeah, he's just like this frog tongue goes...
2397520	2400520	And just grabs the juiciest fly.
2400520	2402520	That's a horrible way of putting it.
2403520	2405520	Why did I have to take something wonderful about a guy
2405520	2406520	that I owe everything to
2406520	2410520	and purposely turn it into the most grotesque thing I could ever...
2410520	2411520	You know why?
2411520	2413520	It's because I started to realize I was flattering myself
2413520	2418520	because I was like, oh, my benefactor has great taste.
2418520	2420520	So I hit like an ear break.
2420520	2422520	I was like, no, make it gross and dumb.
2422520	2424520	Well, back then, you know, it was different
2424520	2426520	because comedy wasn't as big.
2426520	2428520	So, like, Stiller...
2428520	2431520	I think he was on four or five episodes of Saturday Night Live.
2431520	2432520	He was like a writer-performer.
2432520	2434520	They kind of didn't let him on the show.
2434520	2436520	How he got on the show is a crazy story,
2436520	2438520	which is he made a short film,
2438520	2441520	which is a parody of the movie The Color of Money,
2441520	2443520	which is about pool.
2443520	2446520	He did a version with John Mahoney, which was bowling.
2446520	2450520	And he played Tom Cruise, and John Mahoney played Paul Newman.
2450520	2452520	He was a really good impressionist.
2452520	2455520	His Tom Cruise was insane.
2455520	2458520	No one was doing a Tom Cruise impression.
2458520	2461520	Back then, people were still doing, like, Jimmy Cagney.
2461520	2464520	Spirit Agnew.
2464520	2466520	And so he makes this film.
2466520	2469520	He waits in the lobby at NBC,
2469520	2472520	and he sees John Levitz, and he hands it to him.
2472520	2475520	He says, will you show someone at Saturday Night Live?
2475520	2477520	And he did.
2477520	2479520	And then they said, we're going to put it on this weekend.
2479520	2480520	And people loved it.
2480520	2481520	And then he got asked to be on the show.
2481520	2483520	But when he was on the show, he was like,
2483520	2484520	I want to make short films.
2484520	2487520	No one there wanted him to make short films.
2487520	2488520	So he left.
2488520	2491520	Like, he quit Saturday Night Live, like, in six weeks.
2491520	2493520	And he did a show for MTV.
2493520	2497520	And then that didn't go, but had some great YouTube parody
2497520	2498520	that was pretty incredible.
2498520	2499520	It was really good.
2499520	2503520	And then I met him online at Elvis Costello Unplugged.
2503520	2506520	I was with Dana Gould, and he had met Ben.
2506520	2510520	And we both knew HBO was looking to produce a sketch show.
2510520	2513520	And then Ben and I met.
2513520	2514520	We thought of an idea.
2514520	2516520	And we sold it, like, two weeks later.
2516520	2519520	And we had known each other for two weeks
2519520	2520520	when the show got sold.
2520520	2522520	Like, everyone thought we were pals.
2522520	2523520	But we literally just met.
2523520	2527520	But he didn't know that I didn't know how to do anything.
2527520	2532520	And did he got you that EP credit, right?
2532520	2535520	Like, he probably, like, fought for you.
2535520	2537520	I might have had better credits than him at that moment.
2537520	2538520	Oh, OK.
2538520	2539520	Well, if you're doing all those specials,
2539520	2541520	that's the chapter that I noticed.
2541520	2543520	It was a mistake, because HBO wanted a sketch show.
2543520	2545520	And then we pitched it for HBO.
2545520	2547520	And HBO started a production company.
2547520	2549520	And they sold it.
2549520	2551520	So they were the producers.
2551520	2552520	So it would air on Fox.
2552520	2557520	So Fox had no vetting process of, like, these are children.
2557520	2559520	They shouldn't have a network show.
2559520	2561520	And suddenly, I'm the executive producer,
2561520	2563520	from, like, just writing jokes.
2563520	2566520	This is, like, after Christopher Guest's stuff.
2566520	2569520	They would do their little shorts on SNL, right?
2569520	2570520	Yes.
2570520	2572520	So that was already kind of a thing.
2572520	2573520	Yeah.
2573520	2575520	But then that became, like, that was,
2575520	2577520	is that where Mr. Show kind of was launched at?
2577520	2579520	It's like the protoplasmic Mr. Show.
2579520	2580520	Yeah.
2580520	2582520	Odin Kirk and Cross were on it.
2582520	2586520	Garofalo, Andy Dick, our friend Dino Stamatopoulos was on it.
2586520	2590520	And Rob Cullen.
2590520	2591520	Yeah.
2591520	2592520	And...
2592520	2596520	But it was all done with, like, you know,
2596520	2599520	we were so naive, we didn't know that there was a thing called casting.
2599520	2600520	Mm-hmm.
2601520	2603520	So when they said, who's, like, in the show,
2603520	2606520	like, who's your troop,
2606520	2609520	Ben and I just sat down in, like, five minutes, just went,
2609520	2613520	well, Bob and Andy are funny, and Janine's funny.
2613520	2615520	All right.
2615520	2618520	But we didn't know that in town was Jack Black
2618520	2620520	and Will Ferrell and all these people.
2620520	2623520	We just thought, well, who's the funniest people in our group
2623520	2624520	that we love?
2624520	2625520	And...
2625520	2626520	You hear that, Janine?
2626520	2629520	You would have been replaced with Jack Black.
2630520	2632520	He just didn't know he could.
2632520	2634520	But then I was like, Ben would have an instinct,
2634520	2636520	like, you know who's hilarious? Bob.
2636520	2638520	And then back then we were like, okay.
2638520	2639520	Like, we didn't...
2639520	2641520	It wasn't like a corporate process to it.
2641520	2644520	How old are you in that first kickoff?
2644520	2645520	Twenty-four.
2645520	2646520	What?
2646520	2647520	Yeah.
2647520	2648520	That's crazy.
2648520	2650520	Okay, I was pretty young at the...
2652520	2654520	When I...
2655520	2656520	Blogged.
2656520	2658520	Dan, you're 58.
2658520	2659520	I can take it easy.
2659520	2660520	But I...
2661520	2662520	Like, Ben...
2662520	2666520	We refer to this thing called the fraud complex out here.
2666520	2668520	It's something that I learned early on.
2668520	2671520	Like, I was dating...
2671520	2674520	You probably know Tracy Kadsky.
2674520	2675520	I was...
2675520	2679520	She was like my first L.A. girlfriend, I think.
2679520	2683520	I remember kvetching about something at probably that age.
2683520	2685520	She also taught you the word kvetching.
2685520	2687520	Probably, yeah.
2687520	2693520	But she's like, I'm just a drama queen about this and that.
2693520	2694520	She's like, fraud complex.
2694520	2696520	You have a fraud complex.
2696520	2698520	It runs the industry.
2698520	2702520	But I think Ben Stiller's fraud complex runs more industry.
2702520	2705520	It's like, Ben's fraud complex,
2705520	2707520	and I hope he wouldn't be offended by that,
2707520	2708520	because it's a complex.
2708520	2709520	It doesn't mean he's a fraud.
2709520	2711520	He's more than proven that...
2711520	2716520	But he was born with these parents that, you know,
2716520	2717520	they were the...
2717520	2719520	The rest of us have these stories about being in our pajamas
2719520	2721520	and running out at the parties and being like,
2721520	2724520	oh, and here's this little sociopath.
2724520	2726520	Let's all pay attention to them.
2726520	2727520	The funniest guy in the Midwest.
2727520	2733520	And Ben Stiller is the son of these legendary, hilarious,
2733520	2735520	amazing party animal comedy people
2735520	2737520	who are never going to be outshone,
2737520	2739520	no matter what his pajamas look like.
2739520	2743520	And I think that we owe that.
2743520	2745520	We owe everything to that.
2745520	2747520	Like, we owe better calls all to that.
2747520	2748520	We owe everything.
2748520	2753520	It's like the chart of what Ben Stiller being so unsatisfied,
2753520	2756520	being so unable to just go, yeah, nailed it.
2756520	2760520	That made him quit SNL before he, like, drowned in it.
2760520	2763520	It made him, like, do 13 episodes of a show with you
2763520	2766520	that won an Emmy after it got canceled.
2766520	2769520	It makes him, it made him, at least at that time,
2769520	2773520	like, he just always is like, oh, that person's funnier.
2773520	2774520	Who do you say is funnier?
2774520	2777520	Like, if I hear someone's funny, I just go, well, fuck that person.
2777520	2780520	I'll figure out why later.
2780520	2782520	And then maybe over time, I'll go, Dan, what are you doing?
2782520	2783520	Calm down. Go to therapy.
2783520	2785520	Maybe someone's funny.
2785520	2787520	But I feel like Ben would hear someone's funny.
2787520	2789520	He'd go, oh, really?
2789520	2790520	How funny.
2790520	2791520	Can I meet them?
2791520	2792520	Like, can I help them?
2792520	2795520	Well, it was, for Ben, I'd watch it.
2795520	2797520	It was like falling in love.
2797520	2800520	Like, we saw Owen Wilson when we were casting the cable guy.
2800520	2804520	And you could just see it was like a comedy falling in love.
2804520	2806520	You know, we saw a little piece of bottle rocket,
2806520	2808520	and we just lost our mind.
2808520	2810520	Like, this is going to be the greatest thing ever.
2810520	2812520	We thought the movie would make $208.
2812520	2817520	And then that happened with Jack Black
2817520	2820520	and with a bunch of people over the years with that.
2820520	2824520	Yeah, so when you started off by saying our version of casting
2824520	2826520	is just picking the four people that we know,
2826520	2828520	now that you get the pick of the litter,
2828520	2830520	like, how does that work for you now?
2830520	2832520	How does it work now?
2832520	2835520	Well, you know, sometimes I have a lot of energy for casting.
2835520	2838520	When we did Freaks and Geeks, we said, well, let's get real kids.
2838520	2839520	It'll work better with real kids.
2839520	2842520	So me and Paul and Jake Hessen, we would do open calls.
2842520	2843520	And no one does this.
2843520	2847520	We just go, we're at a school at noon in Vancouver.
2847520	2850520	Anyone can come read for us.
2850520	2852520	And 1,000 people would show up.
2852520	2856520	And we did that in Chicago and New York and some other places.
2856520	2858520	And we found people that way.
2858520	2861520	And in other projects, you're just tired.
2861520	2864520	And you just realize, I'm not going to look at that many people,
2864520	2867520	but this one seems good.
2867520	2868520	But does it feel great?
2868520	2871520	Do you give yourself credit for when you look at Freaks and Geeks
2871520	2874520	and the fact that that was in terms of the Lestat factor,
2874520	2879520	the patient zero, that you became patient negative one?
2879520	2882520	Do you acknowledge that?
2882520	2885520	Do you feel proud of that, that every single person in Freaks
2885520	2889520	and Geeks went on to become an entire cottage industry,
2889520	2891520	and that that actually doesn't usually happen,
2891520	2895520	and that that means that you picked up that Ben Stiller habit?
2895520	2896520	Yeah.
2896520	2899520	I mean, it's so weird now when you really look at it
2899520	2901520	and how deep into the show.
2901520	2903520	And there's a whole other level at the show where, like,
2903520	2906520	Shia LaBouf was on the show and saw these other people.
2906520	2910520	We were discovering people that we didn't even...
2910520	2911520	Whatever.
2911520	2913520	I'm not going to finish that one.
2914520	2915520	But it...
2915520	2917520	I always thought it was who was great.
2917520	2920520	It's a very weird thing when you open it up to,
2920520	2922520	we're just going to hire great kids.
2922520	2924520	We're not going to go, I need a blonde for this,
2924520	2926520	I need a tall guy with this attitude.
2926520	2929520	Just who of every kid that you could show us is great,
2929520	2933520	and we will rewrite, Paul will rewrite the script
2933520	2935520	to tailor it to these people.
2935520	2938520	You can find amazing people,
2938520	2941520	but also I felt terrible about the fact that I knew
2941520	2943520	the show was going to get canceled,
2943520	2945520	and all these kids had foregone college.
2945520	2947520	And I really...
2947520	2951520	That was the time where there was way more young stars
2951520	2953520	robbing liquor stores and things.
2953520	2956520	And I thought, I need to not allow that to happen.
2956520	2959520	My Jewish codependency kicked in.
2959520	2961520	And I knew they were all great,
2961520	2963520	so I wanted to keep the team together,
2963520	2966520	but I was also afraid for their lives.
2966520	2967520	Yeah.
2967520	2969520	They don't do that anymore.
2969520	2974520	I guess they slide over to YouTube and get robbed by Google.
2974520	2978520	Which of you two think it's going to play the other one
2978520	2982520	in the movie about the other person?
2982520	2985520	What's more likely?
2985520	2989520	Answer my question.
2989520	2993520	I'll facilitate this in any way I can.
2993520	2997520	I'll play Judd in a movie that's a little darker,
2998520	2999520	more of the...
2999520	3000520	You were in Funny People.
3000520	3001520	That's right.
3001520	3002520	A lot of people don't know.
3002520	3004520	You started my acting career.
3004520	3005520	You and Kyle Kane?
3005520	3006520	Yeah.
3006520	3007520	Yeah.
3007520	3008520	Kyle Kane.
3008520	3011520	You were saying, oh, these paparazzi guys are obnoxious
3011520	3013520	and they say these terrible things.
3013520	3015520	And I was like, really?
3015520	3016520	Really?
3016520	3017520	And then I...
3017520	3019520	I can't remember if it was in the cut
3019520	3021520	or if it's just in my memory.
3021520	3025520	I felt really bad because I said to Adam Sandler's character,
3025520	3027520	was it AIDS or cancer?
3027520	3029520	And then he went...
3029520	3033520	And I felt like it was like, oh, fuck.
3033520	3035520	I'm one of those extras that...
3035520	3036520	You pushed it.
3036520	3037520	You pushed it a little bit.
3037520	3039520	Then he was like, Jesus fucking Christ, can I work?
3039520	3041520	Are you done being funny?
3041520	3042520	You fucking...
3042520	3043520	Paparazzi number two.
3043520	3044520	I was like...
3044520	3046520	I think the final joke we wound up with
3046520	3048520	was just in you saying, is it true
3048520	3051520	that you're going to be in the Ghostbusters reboot?
3051520	3053520	That must have been Kyle, probably.
3053520	3055520	That sounds very smart.
3055520	3057520	And...
3057520	3059520	Yeah, well, so...
3059520	3060520	But it's...
3060520	3062520	So, Freaks and Geeks,
3062520	3066520	then that precedes Larry Sanders' show, right?
3066520	3068520	No, that's after Larry Sanders.
3068520	3070520	Oh, shit. Okay, so now we gotta...
3070520	3074520	I explained all of this in my masterclass.com.
3074520	3077520	$90 and you get five hours of this.
3077520	3079520	I didn't know that you worked on Larry Sanders.
3079520	3080520	What's that?
3080520	3082520	I didn't know that you worked on Larry Sanders.
3082520	3084520	You know, when we did Freaks and Geeks in my head
3084520	3086520	the whole time, I would think...
3086520	3088520	I would trick myself into thinking
3088520	3090520	I was still at Larry Sanders,
3090520	3094520	and this is just a scene about some of their kids.
3094520	3096520	And I thought, if I just write this
3096520	3098520	the way Gary would approach Sanders,
3098520	3099520	it'll be right.
3099520	3101520	And so that was, like, my little private approach.
3101520	3103520	Was Sam Simon still around on that?
3103520	3105520	Sam Simon was on It's Gary Shandling's show.
3105520	3107520	Oh, Sam, he wasn't on the other one.
3107520	3108520	Yeah.
3108520	3110520	I asked you something about Larry Sanders,
3110520	3112520	and I don't think I've ever...
3112520	3114520	I don't know who I've talked to that's been on that.
3114520	3117520	You had a hand in it.
3117520	3118520	The...
3118520	3120520	When I watch it, like...
3120520	3122520	I think I did, like, a rewatch of it a couple years ago,
3122520	3128520	and it looks to me like it...
3128520	3130520	Well, you guys were developing it.
3130520	3133520	The idea would have been that it would have been
3133520	3135520	this kind of noises-off hybrid.
3135520	3137520	That it was going to be very...
3137520	3139520	That there was a formula there
3139520	3141520	that they were going to be rooted in the talk show
3141520	3143520	and that it was going to be...
3143520	3146520	Stories were going to threaten to derail the show,
3146520	3147520	as we told it.
3147520	3149520	And that it clearly evolved into a thing where, like,
3149520	3151520	we definitely didn't care if we ever saw what was happening
3151520	3154520	on stage, if that was just, like, a weird mill
3154520	3158520	that sometimes collapsed and drove everything.
3158520	3162520	Can you just describe, like, was that an evolution?
3162520	3163520	Am I accurate?
3163520	3165520	I think that Gary...
3165520	3168520	I think Gary said he was at the Tonight Show,
3168520	3171520	and he was hosting, and there was some sort of problem
3171520	3172520	with Little Richard.
3172520	3175520	Little Richard was mad about something,
3175520	3177520	and he was watching a producer trying to, like,
3177520	3179520	calm down Little Richard,
3179520	3181520	and I think that he realized, like,
3181520	3184520	there's a whole emotional world behind this show,
3184520	3186520	which has to do with, you know,
3186520	3189520	you have this egomaniacal host
3189520	3191520	that everyone is trying to figure out what he wants,
3191520	3194520	and there's all these relationships
3194520	3196520	between the back crew,
3196520	3198520	and that through the backstage of a talk show,
3198520	3202520	you could explore just the entire human condition,
3202520	3206520	and I think Gary was fascinated by his own problems
3206520	3208520	with wanting to be successful and famous.
3208520	3213520	Like, he hated his own egomaniacal tendencies.
3213520	3218520	But it really became a show about...
3218520	3219520	It was enough...
3219520	3221520	It could have been a black box theater show
3221520	3222520	that never...
3222520	3223520	That one of the sets...
3223520	3226520	You could have broken down the set of the talk show.
3226520	3229520	You kept using it, but it was like his office,
3229520	3232520	and it was the kitchenette, because it was like...
3232520	3238520	And it was just this crazy self-loathing,
3238520	3241520	like, weird spiraling portrait
3241520	3244520	of the kind of guy that's good at this job.
3244520	3246520	And there's nothing that will make him happy.
3246520	3247520	Right.
3247520	3249520	You know, he wants success at all costs
3249520	3253520	to the destruction of most of his relationships,
3253520	3256520	and it just never works until finally
3256520	3259520	he's pushed off his own show by the younger guy.
3259520	3261520	Yeah, I'm just curious, which was Jon Stewart,
3261520	3264520	for you space kids, you little hologram kids.
3264520	3266520	You don't know no Larry Sanders.
3266520	3268520	You thought it was its Gary Shandling show.
3268520	3269520	Oh, that's...
3269520	3271520	It's streaming on HBO.
3271520	3274520	Also, Little Richard was a black entertainer.
3274520	3277520	It was an ironic thing.
3277520	3279520	He was a black entertainer.
3279520	3280520	He was...
3280520	3282520	I'm certain he was mad about Lucille
3282520	3285520	not doing his sister's will.
3285520	3286520	But I just...
3286520	3288520	What I'm curious about is,
3288520	3292520	do you recall a point in some season of that show,
3292520	3294520	the way that I...
3294520	3298520	Because I think about Rick and Morty, thank you.
3298520	3301520	You have daughters, I'm sure you're familiar.
3301520	3304520	The...
3304520	3306520	Did that sound...
3306520	3308520	Maybe because his kids are daughters.
3308520	3310520	We'll certainly fix that one in question.
3310520	3313520	Everyone with kids, that's my in now.
3313520	3315520	I can be like, Elon Musk has kids,
3315520	3318520	so I've touched the fucking space man.
3318520	3322520	Damn, stop it, stop it.
3322520	3325520	Stop touching children.
3325520	3327520	I've got an Elon Musk story.
3327520	3328520	All right, let's...
3328520	3329520	Okay.
3329520	3331520	I'm gonna tell a quick and interesting...
3331520	3334520	I just want to know, is there...
3334520	3336520	Can we go into a segment called Elon Musk stories?
3336520	3338520	Yes, we can in a second.
3338520	3339520	In a second.
3339520	3342520	The current segment is, I want to hear this...
3342520	3344520	If there's a point that you remember
3344520	3346520	where you were doing Larry Sanders,
3346520	3348520	where this template that you decided on,
3348520	3349520	where you're like, you know,
3349520	3351520	we had this whole idea of the show,
3351520	3354520	and was there a frustration or a breakdown
3354520	3357520	or an epiphany where someone or some faction
3357520	3359520	or some people said,
3359520	3362520	we don't even have to ever see the talk show
3362520	3363520	in order for this to be a good show.
3363520	3364520	Yeah, I don't think that was the turn.
3364520	3366520	I think the turn was in the first year or two,
3366520	3367520	he had a wife,
3367520	3369520	and I think that Gary was writing
3369520	3371520	the wife he wished he had.
3371520	3373520	So he had this, like, professional,
3373520	3376520	the Catherine Harold, like, smart woman,
3376520	3378520	and it was almost like,
3378520	3382520	what would a relationship look like if I was Sainer?
3382520	3387520	And it never played the way that it needed to,
3387520	3389520	because that wasn't the kind of person
3389520	3392520	that Gary dated in real life.
3392520	3395520	And so we did have a conversation once
3395520	3398520	about Larry should be single,
3398520	3401520	because I don't think this is truthful
3401520	3403520	what you're trying to do with your wife,
3403520	3405520	and there was also an ex-wife character,
3405520	3407520	and there were some good episodes,
3407520	3408520	and they were great,
3408520	3410520	but as soon as you made him date,
3410520	3412520	I think that was the moment where it became more
3412520	3415520	about his, you know, his personal life
3415520	3417520	and how frustrated he was.
3417520	3420520	And then it became more truthful, I think.
3420520	3421520	Yeah.
3421520	3422520	When I think of that show,
3422520	3424520	I remember this was like him walking into work
3424520	3426520	and already shielding him from everybody,
3426520	3428520	and him just, like, in his baseball cap
3428520	3430520	and just in that voice
3430520	3432520	and just, like, not being able to handle it,
3432520	3434520	and I can't handle it.
3434520	3437520	Like, I actually, at Eclipse,
3437520	3440520	I forgot that there was another part of that show that,
3440520	3442520	like, did you remember the Barney Miller pilot?
3442520	3444520	If you watched the Barney Miller pilot...
3444520	3445520	It was a lot of his wife.
3445520	3447520	It was like, you could tell the pitch was,
3447520	3449520	look, cops have two lives.
3449520	3451520	They got their work family,
3451520	3452520	and they got their home family,
3452520	3454520	because it's like Hal Linden's putting on his...
3454520	3455520	And he, like, loves his wife,
3455520	3457520	and then he goes to work with this, like,
3457520	3459520	crazy sweat-hog group of, like, cops.
3459520	3462520	And, like, the show became a one-act play
3462520	3464520	on one set of these crazy cops.
3464520	3466520	Like, Hal Linden never had a wife again.
3466520	3469520	But it's...
3469520	3471520	The weird connection there is that
3471520	3474520	the Dick Van Dyke show always struggled with that, too,
3474520	3476520	which was the first thing Gary Shambly brought up
3476520	3478520	in the one encounter I ever had with him,
3478520	3480520	which was right before we lost him.
3480520	3483520	And I haven't been able to watch your documentary on him,
3483520	3485520	because I just...
3485520	3488520	It's...
3488520	3491520	I also haven't watched Atlanta, so maybe it's for dumb reasons.
3491520	3492520	Yes.
3492520	3493520	Maybe it's because, like, I don't want to watch
3493520	3495520	Judd Apatow be friends with Gary Shambly.
3495520	3496520	Um...
3496520	3498520	But I also...
3498520	3499520	I'd like to credit myself and think, like,
3499520	3501520	actually, it's kind of heartbreaking,
3501520	3503520	because he was this meta guy.
3503520	3506520	And Sarah Silverman, bless her heart,
3506520	3509520	someone who was smart enough to recognize
3509520	3511520	that she couldn't work with me
3511520	3514520	and yet still would invite me to her rooftop parties,
3514520	3515520	and, you know...
3515520	3517520	That's rare.
3517520	3520520	Well, you mean rare for a person, not rare for her.
3520520	3522520	Not for her, but for a person to...
3522520	3524520	She cast a...
3524520	3526520	She just embraced that.
3526520	3527520	She's nice.
3527520	3531520	And she knew...
3531520	3533520	She's like, you want to meet Gary Shambly.
3533520	3534520	And it was like...
3534520	3536520	It was the last...
3536520	3538520	I was like, well, yeah, but I...
3538520	3540520	She's like, you know, like dragging, you know?
3540520	3542520	Like, just meet him.
3542520	3544520	Gary, this is Dan Harmon.
3544520	3545520	You don't know him.
3545520	3548520	And it's just, like, putting me in a zoo,
3548520	3551520	and, like, it doesn't matter how this turns out for him.
3551520	3553520	Hi, Gary, I'm Dan Harmon.
3553520	3555520	I made a show called NBC Community.
3555520	3557520	I've been reasonably fired from it.
3557520	3559520	Oh, yeah, why did you get fired from it?
3560520	3562520	I think, I mean, I'd like to think,
3562520	3565520	because it was two inside, two meta.
3565520	3568520	He's like, ah, jeez, are they still giving that note?
3568520	3570520	And I was like...
3570520	3573520	And then, because that's what I wanted to hear from him,
3573520	3576520	because his Showtime show, not...
3576520	3580520	He was always the guy where the painting was part of the frame.
3580520	3583520	But he also loves that you're being real with him,
3583520	3587520	and that you're showing him your pain,
3587520	3589520	and that's why he wanted to talk to you,
3589520	3592520	because he really couldn't handle the bullshit.
3592520	3594520	But if you walked up and go, like,
3594520	3596520	I'm all fucked up right now, he's like,
3596520	3599520	let's go, let's get into it, you know?
3599520	3601520	Yeah, and then he immediately went...
3601520	3603520	The rest was him talking about the Dick Van Dyke show,
3603520	3604520	which I found so interesting,
3604520	3607520	because I never even realized Dick Van Dyke show was meta.
3607520	3608520	He worked on...
3608520	3609520	He worked on a goddamn show.
3609520	3610520	He worked on that show?
3610520	3611520	No, no, no.
3611520	3612520	He was saying, like, what is it?
3612520	3613520	Fucking Matt works, hey.
3613520	3616520	Like, oh, it's inside baseball.
3616520	3618520	It's about TV, so it's not TV.
3618520	3620520	Fucking Dick Van Dyke worked on...
3620520	3622520	My impression is fading.
3622520	3624520	He turned into Camille.
3624520	3626520	I can't tolerate your impression.
3626520	3629520	That was the best Camille non-Gioni impression.
3629520	3631520	And it was so great, because it was like,
3631520	3634520	like, wow, this is like the one...
3634520	3638520	He'll never see my show, but I got to say,
3638520	3642520	the network doesn't like it, because it's about...
3642520	3643520	It's aware.
3643520	3645520	And he said, like, my shit's all aware.
3645520	3646520	I'm like, yeah, why the fuck do you think
3646520	3647520	I wanted to meet you?
3647520	3649520	And then he's going, Dick Van Dyke was aware.
3649520	3650520	Television is aware.
3650520	3651520	It's supposed to be...
3651520	3652520	I got a little drunk.
3652520	3653520	Sorry, Judd Apatow.
3653520	3654520	Well, that...
3654520	3655520	But that, you know, when Gary...
3655520	3658520	But that's why I've been unable to watch your documentary,
3658520	3660520	because it's like...
3660520	3662520	And also, if you did one about Harold Ramis,
3662520	3664520	I also would not be able to watch that,
3664520	3668520	because that was a celebrity death that buckled my needs.
3668520	3670520	Well, how do you think I felt having to, like,
3671520	3675520	watch hundreds of hours of Gary just talking?
3675520	3676520	You know, as a friend...
3676520	3678520	You probably loved it, you ghoul.
3679520	3682520	Elon Musk story!
3687520	3688520	Who's going first?
3688520	3690520	Who's going first?
3690520	3691520	Let's start with Dan.
3691520	3695520	Dan, you got the first Elon Musk...
3695520	3698520	I don't know if he was trying to throw a party,
3698520	3700520	but he throws terrible parties.
3702520	3704520	Judd Apatow, you're up!
3705520	3709520	Judd Apatow, Elon Musk story!
3709520	3711520	Okay, before he had the car,
3711520	3715520	and he was just like a mystery scientist guy,
3715520	3718520	I was at an Oscar party, and I was talking to him.
3718520	3720520	I didn't really, like, know the significance of him.
3720520	3723520	He just seemed like a tall, strange, very smart man.
3723520	3726520	And I'm a little drunk, and I don't know.
3726520	3729520	He was in whatever space he lives in, and...
3730520	3732520	Just the regular space.
3733520	3735520	That's where his car is.
3735520	3737520	And that's weird enough.
3737520	3738520	You're not supposed to live in space.
3738520	3742520	I was asking him what he's working on,
3742520	3747520	and he said, I'm trying to invent a rocket ship
3747520	3750520	that will go to Mars and back.
3750520	3752520	And then I said to him,
3752520	3756520	there's no way you'll figure that out before you're dead.
3766520	3769520	That kind of reminds me of...
3769520	3772520	So I'm fucking Elon Musk one night.
3773520	3776520	And I mean, I'm fucking him.
3776520	3783520	Did you ever work with Sam Simon?
3783520	3785520	I never worked with Sam Simon.
3785520	3787520	Although I loved him.
3787520	3790520	There's a story of Jeff...
3790520	3794520	Sam told Jeff this story about himself meeting Bill Clinton,
3794520	3795520	which is that...
3795520	3797520	Oh, yes!
3797520	3798520	He was Sam Simon.
3798520	3801520	He liked The Simpsons and Cheers
3801520	3803520	and fat Albert and fucking everything.
3803520	3805520	Oh, yeah, he created everything.
3805520	3806520	He wrote on everything.
3806520	3808520	Yeah, go ahead.
3808520	3810520	I was just giving him a little...
3810520	3812520	You can tell it if you want.
3812520	3815520	I don't know what the context was,
3815520	3817520	but Sam was meeting Bill Clinton,
3817520	3821520	who was currently the president when he was meeting him.
3821520	3824520	And there was some fundraiser who knows what,
3824520	3827520	and the president does his whole line of things
3827520	3829520	and he's shaking hands.
3829520	3832520	See? Fucking... God damn it.
3832520	3834520	I'm only going to give you this.
3834520	3836520	It was a party that was at a house party
3836520	3838520	in, like, Bel Air or Beverly Hills,
3838520	3839520	and someone said,
3839520	3841520	I think the president's coming by,
3841520	3843520	and everyone's like, no, he's fucking not.
3843520	3844520	And then...
3844520	3845520	And it wasn't Sam's house,
3845520	3846520	it was someone else's house?
3846520	3847520	Yeah, it wasn't Sam's house,
3847520	3851520	but then Bill Clinton shows up at a house party.
3851520	3853520	There's so many people in this world
3853520	3855520	that you can be at a Bel Air party
3855520	3857520	and be Sam Simon
3857520	3860520	and hear that the president's coming by
3860520	3862520	and it's not your house.
3863520	3866520	Like, that's a lot of rich people.
3866520	3867520	So now just take it from there
3867520	3869520	because you'll have everything out of the way.
3869520	3870520	So then the president comes by
3870520	3872520	and he visits... I'm sure it's complicated.
3872520	3873520	When the president comes by,
3873520	3875520	you could probably get shot for passing the mustard.
3875520	3876520	I don't know.
3876520	3877520	They have to...
3877520	3878520	Thank God I took square dancing,
3878520	3880520	if I'm in that situation.
3880520	3883520	But there's a whole line, and all I remember of...
3883520	3885520	It just comes down to a dialogue couplet.
3885520	3889520	It's like Bill Clinton being introduced to Sam.
3889520	3892520	Sam, Sam helped create the Simpsons of...
3892520	3895520	Oh, I love the Simpsons.
3897520	3900520	Wait, wait. Was Camille there too?
3901520	3905520	Oh, Andy. Andy, I love the Simpsons.
3905520	3907520	Wait, are you Barney Fife or Bill Clinton?
3907520	3910520	I did not have relations with Mayberry.
3912520	3915520	You're kind of in the same impression category.
3915520	3918520	Me and James Adomian, we...
3918520	3920520	You learn to categorize things.
3920520	3922520	Fucking...
3922520	3924520	So Bill Clinton goes, I love the Simpsons.
3924520	3926520	And then somebody comes up.
3926520	3928520	There's some kind of...
3928520	3931520	A guy comes up and goes,
3931520	3933520	Mr. President, it's all right.
3933520	3935520	You got to go do the thing,
3935520	3936520	and then the other thing you got to do
3936520	3939520	is even more needing to be done than that.
3939520	3942520	And it's just a bunch of rigmarole,
3942520	3944520	and like, oh...
3944520	3947520	And Bill Clinton, he's like,
3947520	3949520	oh, all right.
3949520	3951520	These people.
3951520	3954520	And I guess I got...
3954520	3957520	What's the set-up line?
3957520	3959520	Bill Clinton goes...
3959520	3962520	Can I just help? Can I help?
3962520	3965520	Just the set-up line. Bill Clinton's line.
3965520	3967520	I know Sam's punch line.
3967520	3970520	He goes, you know, I'm so tired.
3970520	3973520	There's nothing that happens in the White House
3973520	3975520	that doesn't need my looking at,
3975520	3976520	and I have to sign everything.
3976520	3979520	I have to look and sign off
3979520	3981520	and put a signature on everything.
3981520	3982520	And...
3982520	3984520	And Sam goes, tell me about it.
3984520	3986520	LAUGHTER
3989520	3991520	Sam's name is...
3991520	3993520	My favorite story is he...
3993520	3995520	Like, season two of...
3995520	3996520	Have we talked about this?
3996520	3997520	I don't know.
3997520	3998520	Season two of Simpsons,
3998520	4000520	where he goes to the Playboy Mansion?
4000520	4001520	Oh, yeah, yeah, that's...
4001520	4003520	Yeah, I think, yeah, we've...
4003520	4004520	Yeah, we've told...
4004520	4005520	We've done 300 episodes, so...
4006520	4008520	You have told it, yeah.
4008520	4009520	He sees...
4009520	4012520	He goes into the grotto, sees a little blonde girl getting...
4012520	4013520	I mean, why'd you ask?
4013520	4014520	Getting fucked in the butt.
4014520	4015520	I'm doing the...
4015520	4017520	I'm doing the fast version.
4017520	4018520	OK.
4018520	4020520	He's never been invited to the Playboy Mansion.
4020520	4023520	He sees a little young blonde girl getting fucked in the butt
4023520	4025520	by a giant black, you know, football player,
4025520	4029520	and he's watching and, like, everyone's just taking it,
4029520	4031520	like, it's no big deal.
4031520	4033520	And so he lights up a cigarette,
4033520	4034520	and he's watching it,
4034520	4036520	and security runs in with the earpieces in,
4036520	4037520	like, the ear monitors,
4037520	4038520	and they write in, they go,
4038520	4041520	sir, you can't smoke in here.
4047520	4051520	And then, I'm sure I've told the story eight times on the show,
4051520	4054520	like, 30 minutes later, he's outside the grotto,
4054520	4056520	the girl comes out naked, rubbing her butt,
4056520	4058520	like, kind of in pain,
4058520	4060520	and she goes,
4061520	4064520	what was the name of this club again?
4064520	4066520	And I asked Sam, like, what was her line reading,
4066520	4068520	like, because I want to call my friends up
4068520	4070520	or fuck this place, like, get me the phone,
4070520	4073520	and he goes, her line reading was kind of like,
4073520	4075520	who needs this?
4078520	4080520	OK.
4080520	4083520	So, like, like, like...
4083520	4085520	Now he's dead.
4086520	4091520	Third act of this is, like, sort of like...
4091520	4093520	I told you backstage, because I was like,
4093520	4096520	I'm a bad interviewer, do you...
4096520	4098520	What do you not want to talk about?
4098520	4099520	What do you want to talk about?
4099520	4100520	You're like, what do you want to talk about?
4100520	4102520	I said, honestly, if I met you at a party,
4102520	4105520	I would start the conversation with the topic of,
4105520	4107520	when is it enough?
4107520	4110520	When is enough enough, and what does that mean?
4110520	4114520	And because it circles these areas of, like,
4115520	4117520	the fraud complex we've dealt with,
4117520	4118520	that's the road of trials,
4118520	4121520	and we don't need to be hooked up to a polygraph,
4121520	4123520	and I can ask you a thousand times,
4123520	4125520	do you have a fraud complex?
4125520	4126520	And you can either say yes or no,
4126520	4128520	and we'll never really understand,
4128520	4131520	like, do you really, like, do you look in the mirror
4131520	4132520	when you go home at night and go,
4132520	4135520	Judd Apatow, who are you kidding?
4136520	4139520	I had this conversation with my psychic yesterday.
4140520	4142520	Honestly, I was talking to a psychic.
4142520	4144520	Was your psychic by psychic?
4144520	4146520	Would you recommend them?
4146520	4149520	It's hard to know, because I was...
4149520	4150520	It's always hard, because I've got to see
4150520	4152520	if the predictions work or not,
4152520	4155520	so I need a little more time to decide if the psychic was good.
4155520	4158520	But there was this psychic that we were talking to,
4158520	4160520	because we occasionally like a good psychic,
4160520	4163520	and this woman was just wrong about everything,
4163520	4166520	but really confident, you know?
4166520	4169520	You and your wife, or...?
4169520	4173520	Well, it was separately, but the woman was like,
4173520	4175520	you like the classic cars?
4175520	4177520	You like the classic cars?
4177520	4179520	You know?
4179520	4181520	You know?
4181520	4183520	Your mom's not doing well.
4183520	4185520	She's got the Alzheimer's.
4185520	4187520	I'm like, well, no, she's dead already.
4187520	4189520	Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4189520	4191520	But she also took big swings at, like,
4191520	4194520	really terrible things happening.
4194520	4196520	So you were in Katrina?
4196520	4197520	Yeah.
4198520	4201520	Yeah, there's no way to even turn that into...
4201520	4202520	But a storm.
4202520	4205520	You've seen your share of storms.
4205520	4206520	But she did say to you,
4206520	4208520	you're depressed, right, right?
4208520	4211520	You thought about killing yourself, right, right?
4211520	4212520	And I was like...
4212520	4213520	No, for real?
4213520	4214520	Big swings, big swings.
4214520	4215520	For real?
4215520	4216520	Oh, yeah.
4216520	4218520	Wait, that's a fucking...
4218520	4219520	That's a home run hitter.
4219520	4221520	If there was a psychic movie equivalent of
4221520	4223520	Slapshot or Happy Gilmore,
4223520	4225520	they'd be like, fuck it.
4226520	4230520	And there's a prude, antagonist, psychic centrist who's like,
4230520	4233520	you can't read fortunes like that.
4233520	4234520	Hey, fuck it.
4234520	4236520	You fucked Paul Bunyan.
4236520	4237520	No, I didn't.
4237520	4239520	Well, you're gonna.
4239520	4240520	Whoo!
4240520	4243520	It's in the way that you use it.
4244520	4246520	So was she close?
4246520	4248520	No, she was wrong on everything.
4248520	4250520	Every single thing she was wrong.
4250520	4252520	Although I felt bad because I felt like she looked in my eyes
4252520	4254520	and just thought, like...
4254520	4256520	You know, I think that those people mainly just look at you
4256520	4257520	and if you're in a good mood,
4257520	4259520	they kind of say things that support that.
4259520	4261520	And if you're in a bad mood, they're like,
4261520	4262520	you're having a hard time, aren't you?
4262520	4265520	And, like, I gave off the terrible vibe
4265520	4267520	that she just thought my life was trouble.
4267520	4269520	But she clearly didn't know who you were.
4269520	4272520	She wasn't a big Apatow fan.
4272520	4273520	She didn't...
4273520	4275520	If she knew you, she would have been more like a little...
4275520	4276520	No, she didn't.
4276520	4277520	On point.
4277520	4278520	Well, she was English.
4278520	4280520	She was English.
4281520	4285520	She was like, this is 40, isn't on cable yet.
4285520	4286520	And you're like, no, it is.
4286520	4288520	And she's like, well, not here.
4289520	4292520	Do the English not dig your movies?
4293520	4295520	In England, do they dig them?
4295520	4296520	I don't know.
4296520	4302520	I've gone places and it never seems to catch on in a big way.
4303520	4307520	Well, you are pretty anti-British in your movies.
4307520	4309520	You know, we've worked with the Russell brands
4309520	4310520	and the English people,
4310520	4313520	and it doesn't seem to explode the whole thing.
4313520	4315520	I only went to a psychic one time.
4315520	4318520	I was on a road trip and I was like,
4318520	4319520	well, fun.
4319520	4321520	You go in the psychic.
4321520	4322520	That's what everyone thinks.
4322520	4323520	No one thinks...
4323520	4325520	I'm not severe of going in a psychic.
4326520	4327520	They went out.
4327520	4329520	But I thought it would be an occult experience.
4329520	4331520	I didn't know it would be...
4331520	4333520	It's like she laid out some...
4333520	4335520	I think she did some tarot cards
4335520	4337520	or maybe it was pong history.
4337520	4338520	I can't...
4338520	4340520	Because what I remember is she was like,
4340520	4342520	well, you want to do this, but you want to do that.
4342520	4344520	It was actually the opposite of what you're describing,
4344520	4345520	like no...
4345520	4347520	Like tiny little weed whacker swings
4347520	4349520	that couldn't help but be accurate.
4349520	4351520	She's like, you're conflicted about something
4351520	4353520	related to your life.
4354520	4356520	Like, you're good.
4357520	4359520	And it was like, you know,
4359520	4362520	the part of you that went in, paid money,
4362520	4363520	is like, that's the smarter move
4363520	4366520	because you actually are engaging in a self-inventory
4366520	4368520	that could be beneficial.
4368520	4369520	It could be a form of therapy.
4369520	4371520	But then at the end of it, it's like,
4371520	4373520	it just turned into like, this is like, you know,
4373520	4375520	and, you know, you've turned your back on Christ
4375520	4377520	and he just needs to...
4378520	4379520	And it just...
4379520	4380520	Everything got Christian and I'm like,
4380520	4381520	wait, how do you know...
4381520	4382520	That's been our show, you guys.
4382520	4383520	Thanks for coming.
4384520	4385520	How do you know I'm not Muslim
4385520	4387520	and aren't you a witch?
4388520	4390520	How are you even on this team?
4390520	4391520	What do you even...
4392520	4394520	When I was like 10 years old, I got my palm red
4394520	4396520	and the woman looks at my hand and she goes,
4396520	4398520	when you're in your late 40s,
4398520	4400520	you're going to have an injury to your right ear.
4400520	4403520	I'm like, give me this hand back.
4404520	4407520	There's no way there's that many lines.
4407520	4410520	It's fucking impossible.
4411520	4414520	We went to a psychic and the psychic implied,
4414520	4416520	it was like, we were about to go on vacation to Hawaii
4416520	4419520	and she was like, I'm seeing, I don't know,
4419520	4421520	I'm seeing some windy roads.
4423520	4426520	She was like, probably we're going to die on the vacation.
4426520	4430520	And so we went to Hawaii and hid in the room for 10 days.
4431520	4433520	Until you realize, it's an island.
4433520	4435520	Every road is supposed to be windy.
4435520	4437520	The dangerous roads would be straight.
4437520	4438520	We got scared.
4438520	4439520	But we proved her...
4439520	4441520	I don't know if we proved her correct or not correct
4441520	4443520	because we didn't die.
4444520	4447520	Also, I think the same woman like two months later,
4447520	4450520	in my hand, he goes, you're going to live forever.
4450520	4451520	Whoa!
4451520	4454520	I'm like, but what about my fucking ear?
4456520	4458520	It's like you're Thor, so I'm like,
4458520	4459520	you're going to live forever,
4459520	4461520	but your brother's going to take your ear.
4461520	4462520	He's a giant ox.
4462520	4465520	Also, I've been told I'm going to have three children.
4465520	4467520	I think that ship has sailed.
4467520	4469520	Everything was a lie.
4469520	4472520	Nothing's ever been accurate about that.
4472520	4475520	Let's respect our guests and give them...
4475520	4476520	Oh, look at that.
4476520	4477520	See, I fucking nailed it.
4477520	4479520	I'm so good at this show.
4479520	4482520	All right, what are you plugging?
4484520	4485520	I'm plugging.
4485520	4486520	I thought we were...
4486520	4489520	I thought we were talking about when is enough enough.
4489520	4490520	Oh, yeah, but look, I...
4490520	4492520	Hey, Jed, can we talk about you being the host
4492520	4495520	on Chop Junior for the next two seasons?
4495520	4496520	Yeah, I know.
4496520	4498520	Well, do you have fantasies of retirement?
4498520	4499520	Do you have plans to...
4499520	4500520	Well...
4500520	4502520	This is Dan asking about whether or not
4502520	4504520	he's allowed to retire.
4504520	4506520	Do you think about him retiring?
4506520	4509520	Why do you still do it?
4509520	4513520	Because it's always been for the money,
4513520	4515520	and I hate everyone, and they've always hated me,
4515520	4517520	and I arrived alone, and I'm leaving likewise,
4517520	4519520	and they've been hurtful,
4519520	4521520	and they're going to miss me when I'm gone.
4526520	4530520	And to prove it, I just drove a Tesla yesterday,
4530520	4531520	on Sunday.
4531520	4533520	Dan, sorry, I had to cut you off for a second.
4534520	4536520	Hold your thought here.
4536520	4538520	Dan, you're never going to fucking retire,
4538520	4542520	because your identity is based on your output.
4542520	4547520	Like, you want to be liked and to be in the mix.
4547520	4549520	Like, you're going to fuck...
4549520	4551520	Tell him, Jed. Tell him.
4551520	4553520	No, Dan, you tell me.
4553520	4556520	How much money have you made?
4556520	4561520	Well, am I allowed to count the money I'm going to make?
4561520	4562520	Yeah.
4562520	4563520	Oh, okay.
4563520	4565520	Like, hundreds of millions of dollars.
4567520	4569520	If you can't count it until you have it,
4569520	4571520	I don't know, like, ten dollars?
4571520	4573520	Are you like Ryan?
4573520	4574520	What's his name, Ryan Murphy?
4574520	4576520	Do you have a Ryan Murphy deal?
4576520	4579520	Yes, probably.
4579520	4581520	Jed, you and I have just met.
4581520	4585520	I can guarantee you, having known Dan for a long, long, long time,
4585520	4587520	he's never going to retire,
4587520	4591520	because his identity is too built into the work.
4591520	4595520	You want to create, and you want people to like the things that you create.
4595520	4596520	Jed, do you think, based...
4596520	4598520	You're a storyteller.
4598520	4602520	Is this the character in the movie that is the good friend or the...
4605520	4609520	Is this the drinking buddy that doesn't want you to get married or...?
4609520	4613520	Dan, like, if you went off the air, Dan,
4613520	4615520	if you went off the air and didn't have a TV show,
4615520	4617520	didn't have a movie coming out, didn't have a podcast...
4617520	4619520	Have I moved to Montana?
4619520	4623520	You'd be happy just moving to the hills and completely switching off.
4623520	4625520	Well, I wouldn't take it that extreme.
4625520	4627520	I mean, like, Larry Sanders in that season,
4627520	4629520	like, he's a very resonant thing.
4629520	4630520	He has this fantasy.
4630520	4632520	He's like, I'm going to go to a cabin in Montana.
4632520	4635520	It just becomes this mantra, and then, like, the season ends with,
4635520	4637520	like, there's the cabin.
4637520	4639520	He's in Montana, and it's just, like, quiet.
4639520	4642520	He's like, fuck.
4642520	4643520	But I wouldn't...
4643520	4648520	I don't make the mistake of thinking that I don't love attention
4648520	4652520	and that I don't need to feel the admiration of strangers and all this stuff.
4652520	4654520	I simply...
4654520	4659520	Like, I'm pretty confident that I mean it when I say,
4659520	4663520	I would love to wake up one morning and ask myself the question,
4663520	4666520	what do I want to do?
4666520	4668520	Because you're burdened with the challenge.
4668520	4671520	There's too much to do to get all the work done.
4671520	4672520	Yeah, and I think...
4672520	4674520	Not have a deadline, not have a boss.
4674520	4676520	To make a couple little dumb movies,
4676520	4678520	that got you your start.
4678520	4679520	And the guy that goes,
4679520	4681520	Shrob and I did Channel 101, it was like,
4681520	4684520	these are the happiest times of our lives when we were in our 20s
4684520	4686520	and we made these, like, dumb things.
4686520	4688520	And, yeah, you make them now and you put them on Instagram
4688520	4691520	and you just, like, 40 Nazis go stop talking about politics.
4691520	4692520	I don't know.
4692520	4694520	But who cares about them?
4694520	4696520	It's not for them.
4696520	4699520	I just want to watch them burn.
4699520	4702520	It's like the fulfillment, like, I'll make a little song
4702520	4704520	and I'll go, like, that feels nice.
4704520	4706520	I think that's the expression on my dad's face
4706520	4707520	when he works on stained glass.
4707520	4709520	He's like, my dad doesn't go,
4709520	4713520	I can't stand not working on VHS duplication anymore.
4713520	4716520	My dad doesn't have to be good or bad or lying or honest
4716520	4720520	in order to be, like, I'd prefer working on stained glass.
4720520	4721520	He's really bad at it.
4721520	4723520	Like, I hope my dad...
4723520	4725520	He makes terrible stained glass.
4725520	4726520	Is he a fan of the show?
4726520	4727520	Should we not talk about that?
4727520	4729520	I don't think so.
4729520	4731520	Because I think in the 300 episodes of this show,
4731520	4734520	I think even just as an aggregate,
4734520	4736520	we've probably provided tutelage
4736520	4738520	in making stained glass better than he's made.
4738520	4740520	On accident.
4740520	4742520	Okay, well, all right.
4742520	4745520	The reason you groaned is because the joke
4745520	4747520	was poorly constructed.
4747520	4750520	It's not because it was, like, a low blow.
4750520	4751520	You were groaning because you were like,
4751520	4753520	oh, a vat for that?
4753520	4755520	Just to say your dad's shitty.
4755520	4756520	Judd, how about you?
4756520	4757520	Are you going to be the kind of person
4757520	4759520	that wants to retire soon or worked...
4760520	4761520	No, no.
4761520	4762520	They put you in the dirt.
4762520	4763520	No, I just...
4763520	4768520	Sometimes I think the things that are smaller
4768520	4770520	are less pressure and more fun.
4770520	4773520	Like, it was really enjoyable to, you know,
4773520	4775520	work on the documentary.
4775520	4777520	I made a documentary about the Avitt brothers
4777520	4779520	and about Donald Strawberry and Dwight Gooden,
4779520	4781520	and I find that I'm getting more and more joy
4781520	4783520	out of the things I don't get paid for.
4783520	4786520	Have you been able to find some place where you don't...
4787520	4791520	What is your relationship with people's opinion of you?
4791520	4792520	Yeah.
4795520	4797520	Because I'm only to the place where I can go,
4797520	4799520	oh, fuck them.
4799520	4801520	That's the healthiest I can get.
4801520	4803520	Even the ones who like you.
4803520	4804520	No, no, no.
4804520	4805520	Not fuck them.
4805520	4806520	No.
4806520	4809520	A thousand camels for their children.
4809520	4812520	No, I just mean, like, it's like,
4812520	4815520	oh, that relationship can hurt me.
4815520	4817520	So, fuck it.
4817520	4820520	But you're about to tell me how to get a relationship
4820520	4823520	where you're like, actually, it's okay for them to say,
4823520	4825520	fuck you, Judd Apatow,
4825520	4827520	you straight white fucking privileged piece of shit
4827520	4829520	that's never fucking by, fuck you,
4829520	4831520	and you hacky bullshit.
4831520	4833520	Oh, it's like, when you're on every billboard
4833520	4835520	because you're a piece of shit, fuck you.
4835520	4837520	And then you're able to go like...
4837520	4840520	Judd, you're allowed to leave whenever you want to.
4840520	4842520	But, like, you...
4842520	4844520	But you feel there's like a debate on the work
4844520	4847520	that's happening, that there's some people who love it,
4847520	4850520	and there's some people who enjoy engaging with you
4850520	4852520	and attacking you for different reasons.
4852520	4854520	There's not even a debate on the work.
4854520	4856520	Like, maybe this...
4856520	4857520	It's like, oh, the work's great.
4857520	4859520	Is it ever going to make this guy a good person?
4859520	4860520	Yeah.
4860520	4862520	Why do they think you're a bad person?
4862520	4863520	I'm a bad person.
4863520	4864520	Yeah.
4864520	4866520	But why are you a bad person?
4866520	4869520	Well, ironically, a lot of...
4869520	4872520	Judd Apatow just called you a bad person.
4872520	4874520	I want that to go on record.
4874520	4877520	I would like to think, ironically, it's because,
4877520	4879520	well, I had work to do.
4879520	4881520	You had work to do, and that made you a bad person?
4881520	4882520	Yeah.
4882520	4887520	My work wasn't in the area of being a good person.
4887520	4890520	But you were focusing on your own ego and your own success
4890520	4892520	and not helping anybody.
4892520	4893520	Like, if somebody came up and said, like,
4893520	4895520	hey, can you help me open this soda?
4895520	4900520	I'd be like, how is that going to make television good?
4900520	4901520	Yeah.
4901520	4902520	And they'd go, we're eight.
4902520	4906520	And I'm like, well, bitch, you better fucking figure it out.
4906520	4907520	Yeah.
4907520	4909520	Because I'm going to be controlling TV one day,
4909520	4911520	and you're going to be opening sodas.
4911520	4912520	Yeah.
4912520	4914520	And you compound that for 40 years.
4914520	4915520	Yeah.
4915520	4917520	But it's like, is there a difference between our breed?
4917520	4918520	Are you a...
4918520	4923520	You're a more likeable person, right?
4923520	4925520	Like, you're...
4925520	4928520	I think this crowd likes you more than me, so you're wrong.
4928520	4931520	They're self-abusive.
4931520	4932520	So yes, you're right.
4932520	4933520	They do.
4933520	4937520	But because they conflate loathing with authenticity.
4937520	4940520	And so then they're like, ah, I like him because he hates himself.
4940520	4942520	That gives me a break from hating myself.
4942520	4943520	It's terrible.
4943520	4944520	We're all unhealthy.
4944520	4945520	I see.
4945520	4946520	That's true.
4946520	4949520	But that's why we have guests like you to invite us upward.
4949520	4952520	And so I think we're all asking you, do you have a secret?
4952520	4955520	Can we escape this?
4955520	4956520	Well, I used to be...
4956520	4960520	I think I used to have a lot more of your energy early in my career
4960520	4962520	because I remember I was working on The Betz Tiller Show
4962520	4964520	and they gave me all these terrible notes.
4964520	4968520	And I said to the guy, I said, well, I'm not doing any of them.
4968520	4970520	What happens now?
4970520	4974520	Yeah!
4974520	4975520	Yay!
4975520	4978520	And then we got canceled.
4978520	4979520	And I did the same thing.
4979520	4980520	And you won an Emmy!
4980520	4982520	And then I did the same thing on Freezing Geeks and we got canceled.
4982520	4984520	I did the same thing on Undeclared and we got canceled.
4985520	4987520	And then I made this pilot with the great Dave Herman
4987520	4989520	from Office Space and King of the Hill.
4989520	4990520	And he had a beard.
4990520	4992520	He played a parole officer.
4992520	4996520	And the head of the network said, I want you to reshoot.
4996520	4998520	We were three days into shooting the pilot.
4998520	5001520	I want you to reshoot everything because I don't like the beard
5001520	5006520	because only villains and pirates have beards.
5006520	5008520	And so then the head of the production company came to me and said,
5008520	5009520	can you do this?
5009520	5011520	Will you reshoot everything you've done?
5011520	5013520	But we had been improvising for three days.
5013520	5016520	We couldn't really recreate what had happened.
5016520	5019520	And he looked better with the beard as kind of a grizzled guy.
5019520	5022520	And I said, I don't think I can do it.
5022520	5025520	Like, I don't think that it will be better without the beard.
5025520	5028520	And she said, if you don't shave the beard,
5028520	5032520	there's no chance this show will get picked up.
5032520	5033520	I'm like, really?
5033520	5035520	Like, she will hold that against me.
5035520	5037520	Like, she begged me to make a show.
5037520	5040520	But she will hold it against me and not pick it up only because of the beard.
5040520	5041520	She said, yes.
5041520	5043520	And I'm like, well, I'm not shaving the beard.
5043520	5047520	And then they didn't pick up the show.
5047520	5050520	So I have had Dan Harmon here.
5050520	5052520	Like, keep going.
5052520	5054520	Was there a dead man's curve?
5054520	5057520	Or you're like, I can't do it.
5057520	5058520	There was.
5058520	5059520	There was a dead man's curve.
5059520	5061520	Which is I was working on The 40-Year-Old Virgin.
5061520	5064520	And I was like, again, I was like three days in.
5064520	5066520	We had only shot two things.
5066520	5070520	We shot, he was like, remember, there was like a bus that had all this like sexy
5070520	5071520	signs on it.
5071520	5075520	And he was just running away from this bus with a perfume ad on the side.
5075520	5077520	And so we shot that.
5077520	5080520	And then we shot this speed dating sequence.
5080520	5082520	And the studio saw it.
5082520	5086520	And then someone from the studio, in the middle of the day,
5086520	5089520	called and said, shut the movie down.
5089520	5093520	And they said, Steve looks like a serial killer.
5093520	5095520	And Paul Rudd looks fat.
5095520	5098520	And you're lighting it like an indie.
5098520	5101520	And it also felt like they didn't really understand the style,
5101520	5103520	immediately, of what we were doing.
5103520	5106520	And that was usually the moment where I would like, you know,
5106520	5110520	burn everything down and we wouldn't start up again.
5110520	5113520	And for the first time in my career, I went, okay,
5113520	5116520	I'm going to listen to everything they say.
5116520	5118520	Because someone said to me, when you,
5118520	5121520	would you tell people their notes are stupid?
5121520	5123520	You're basically calling them stupid.
5123520	5126520	And then they may get their mission to destroy you.
5126520	5128520	But that's their reaction.
5128520	5130520	This is all in the master class, by the way.
5130520	5134520	And so I said, don't do it.
5134520	5136520	Just listen to the notes.
5136520	5138520	Maybe there's a way to do the notes.
5138520	5141520	And so she's like, well, he looks like a serial killer.
5141520	5144520	And I said, well, because he's wearing like a tan,
5144520	5146520	like a Jeffrey Dahmer jacket all the time.
5146520	5149520	And I said, well, we probably could make that maybe like a running gag
5149520	5151520	that everyone tells him he's looking like a serial killer.
5151520	5152520	That's good. I like that.
5152520	5153520	And then we did that.
5153520	5155520	And it became a big part of the story.
5155520	5158520	It became a lantern on it, we call that.
5158520	5160520	You don't address the note.
5160520	5162520	You make the note part of the script.
5162520	5165520	I actually made up a comedy term that no one uses,
5165520	5169520	which is a certain joke is a turd in a slipper.
5169520	5171520	A slipper?
5171520	5173520	A turd in a slipper, which basically means,
5173520	5176520	like you put your foot in a slipper with a turd in it.
5176520	5180520	And it's a joke that feels good, but it's not right.
5186520	5191520	If this episode is not called turd in a slipper, I quit.
5191520	5197520	But then I couldn't make Paul Rudd skinnier because I wanted Rudd to be fat.
5197520	5201520	You know, I thought, you know, he was always so cute and like clueless.
5201520	5205520	And I was always like, I like him like when he looks like he's falling apart.
5205520	5210520	And so I said, I'm going to make Paul lose weight, but it was too late.
5210520	5213520	You wanted to poop in a slipper.
5213520	5216520	And then, you know, the lighting is the lighting.
5216520	5220520	And then I realized like, oh, this didn't even make sense shutting us down.
5220520	5225520	Like she could have just called and said, hey, keep an eye on these three things.
5225520	5234520	That happens a lot where like an email will come in and it's like their choice to make it seem catastrophic.
5234520	5237520	And so their language is catastrophic.
5237520	5242520	And so you inherit that and then you go, well, then defiance is the only idea.
5242520	5243520	I'm just beating that horse.
5243520	5247520	But it's like, yeah, that is why it's worth like breathing and going, what's the note behind the note?
5247520	5248520	How do you actually do this?
5248520	5256520	Like let them be hysterical and go like, actually, this is this is as most notes is addressable.
5256520	5260520	Yeah. And the way to be defiant is to prove that that serves your ego.
5260520	5265520	And go like, actually, you guys think it's hard to make him not look like a serial killer.
5265520	5267520	All you had to say is please.
5267520	5270520	Yeah. And you can retain your ego and you're like,
5270520	5275520	but it's so hard because when they give you the notes, what you're thinking is I'm funny.
5275520	5283520	And it's because it's because that's a link to the presupposition that you didn't you don't know what you're doing.
5283520	5291520	Yeah, it has to be because if you really knew when you really have confidence, isn't your it's like actually dumb shit.
5291520	5294520	Say like, are you sure this should be a thing?
5294520	5301520	Yeah. Like, like, isn't it kind of like, do you want us to engage in the humiliating ritual of changing it for you?
5301520	5306520	Like, you kind of like you have that, like, power that Harry Potter scar in your head.
5306520	5312520	I think for me, it was like, for me, the reason why I'm also that confident is no, I'm not.
5312520	5320520	I but but I just realized I don't know if maybe was that moment that coincide with you.
5320520	5330520	A relationship in your personal life, a daughter born or a wife married that you're like, I got to stop making bridges out of firewood.
5330520	5340520	Well, you know, I had I had a realization, which is I think something anytime something would happen, like with the show or even the scene or anything going wrong.
5340520	5348520	I would just lose my shit. And my wife would always make fun of me and just, you know, just be like, oh, nightmare on the side, nightmare on the side.
5348520	5351520	Like mock me, you know, meltdown on the side.
5351520	5359520	What will you do? And and she just so laughed at me for the fact that I would go to 10 on things that weren't that important.
5359520	5364520	And and I made a connection at one point I was in this giant fight.
5364520	5370520	I wanted to direct this the pilot that with Dave Herman, I couldn't get them to let me direct it.
5370520	5386520	They said no. And I was just losing my shit. And I realized that I was treating the head of the network like my mother and that I was looking to there were two heads of the network at Fox.
5386520	5395520	I think they were like my mom and dad getting divorced and that I had the energy of like a 14 year old fucking flipping out with them.
5395520	5401520	And I'm like, this isn't what's happening. I have different energy than what's actually going wrong here.
5401520	5412520	And as soon as I realized I was treating the head of the network like my mother, I made a choice to find people who understood what I do and that I wouldn't be in fights.
5412520	5420520	If I really spent more time going, what executive gets the joke? Right. And ever since I've done that, it's all easier.
5420520	5429520	But you have to really remember that Larry Gilbert and Larry Gilbert wrote the movie Neighbors, the one with John Belushi and Dan Eckert.
5429520	5436520	And he said he went out to dinner with the director and the director wasn't funny, but he didn't do anything about it.
5436520	5441520	He was just like, he wasn't funny. And then like two weeks in the shooting, he's like, this is a disaster.
5441520	5449520	And he said he realized like at that moment, I got to pull the plug on the whole thing. I have to make sure that these are the right people.
5449520	5454520	Like if I don't if I don't have the right team around me, the whole thing is screwed.
5454520	5459520	And so that's what I tried to do, slow down and go, who really understands me?
5459520	5466520	But but an argument could be made that that that guy that melts down, that that's what he's trying to do.
5466520	5471520	He's he's trying to make the he's going, this isn't right. You're not right. You don't get me.
5471520	5477520	This email is you being a person that can't work with me.
5477520	5483520	And so we have these stories where, oh, OK, and then I rose and I breathed and I became a better collaborator.
5483520	5487520	But then you just undercut it right there because it's like that's just as true, too.
5487520	5492520	It's like, yeah, if you don't have chemistry, how are you ever going to make anything work?
5492520	5497520	You didn't know you were allowed to not cast your friends in the Ben Stiller show.
5497520	5499520	That's that's the Emmy winning sketch show.
5499520	5504520	They laughed at me when I said, let's let's have Seth Rogen be the lead of undeclared.
5504520	5508520	They literally started laughing like it was so ridiculous.
5508520	5516520	And but I think that at some point you realize, like all this energy I put into my meltdown, it's not actually making anything better.
5516520	5525520	It is making me sick. And is there any way to just not do it only because it's it's exhausting at some point in that place?
5525520	5530520	Is there a part because like I I'm not like an employer.
5530520	5537520	You got you guys have things that go on where you have 100 people that work, you know, with you underneath you like and you're making.
5537520	5542520	You know, you could have fooled me with where you're pushing this sports drink backstage.
5542520	5553520	I don't know. I thought I was I just thought I'd invent some weird thing that Jeff has a sports drink company like it didn't land.
5553520	5557520	How is he famous? How is between you and me?
5557520	5559520	Why is that even here? I know.
5559520	5568520	But like when you're like in a creative space and you have all these people underneath you that are reliant upon you,
5568520	5575520	how much does that weigh into your daily decision making at all or not a bit?
5575520	5581520	Well, it depends on the project because sometimes you're working with people and you go, this is their big break.
5581520	5586520	Like, so if I fuck this up, Amy Schumer is screwed.
5586520	5588520	She's not going to get another movie.
5588520	5591520	I got to do a good job. I'm going to really hurt her long term prospects.
5591520	5600520	I think about it, but it's worse when I work with my kids because I just think I'm going to make my children a laughingstock around the world.
5600520	5606520	Also, there's wardrobe people, the makeup department, all these grips and carpenters and all this stuff.
5606520	5615520	I was kind of happy about one aspect of the Roseanne thing, which was that actually for the first time in mainstream media talking about the television industry,
5615520	5619520	there was a big talking point that was 200 people lost their jobs.
5619520	5627520	And I'm not saying, oh, that was a great talking point or as bad as like, we'd never really talk about that.
5627520	5629520	And also, it's not always true.
5629520	5640520	Every day that Sony came to a table read on community, their theme was actually, you're fucking 200 people over with your shitty, late, crazy Dungeons and Dragons scripts.
5640520	5648520	That's why I kept saying to them, you know, you can always fire me and all these guys that saw wood and hall cable be safe in your fucking loving army.
5649520	5659520	It's kind of like sometimes that fraud complex goes, I need to get out of here to save people hauling cable.
5659520	5665520	But do you think, I know this sounds weird, but everyone in show business is in the circus.
5665520	5672520	So this isn't like people have been working at Ford for 25 years and the show goes down and they never get a job again.
5672520	5675520	They all just jump on another fucking Hulu show.
5676520	5680520	Yeah, I mean, you might have three or four bad ones.
5680520	5682520	That's if they're lucky.
5682520	5693520	But I think that a lot of people's like, like when somebody like Kevin Spacey gets Kevin Spacey and the House of House of Cards just dies.
5693520	5699520	There's some probably 150 people that said, fuck, I just got hired.
5699520	5701520	Like, I thought I had.
5701520	5702520	No, it definitely sucks.
5702520	5704520	I mean, it definitely sucks.
5704520	5705520	It's it's awful.
5705520	5709520	But, you know, only shows are like eight episodes or ten episodes.
5709520	5716520	And there's so much demand for crews for shows that like the biggest part of it.
5716520	5719520	I mean, you get screwed is like certain actors or actresses.
5719520	5721520	They can only work on that show.
5721520	5723520	You know, there are certain people on Roseanne.
5723520	5727520	You go, this is where they're going to score in this show.
5728520	5735520	You know, I guess my question wasn't so much about the like the grand picture of Laurie Metcalf being out of a job.
5735520	5744520	It's it's the fact that like when you're writing an episode, fighting with the network, fighting with the studio, having your own little like tug of war.
5744520	5750520	How much do you think about the fact that you're that you're in charge of a lot of people?
5750520	5753520	Well, I only think about it in the sense that there's a big crew.
5753520	5761520	And this sounds like bullshit, but I really think I'd like this all to work well for them so that they all feel respected.
5761520	5765520	If anything gets weird, they can come to me and it will be dealt with.
5765520	5767520	And that like we're like a happy family.
5767520	5769520	That's not a big burden on you as you're doing the crew.
5769520	5770520	It's not hard to do.
5770520	5775520	It's hard to be pleasant and nice to the people who work for you.
5775520	5779520	Like the people who are a nightmare, it requires more energy.
5779520	5786520	How much time like like how many sets crews like shows have you been on where it was a fucking nightmare?
5786520	5790520	Because I've been very lucky to work in comedy where everybody's nice.
5790520	5791520	Yeah.
5791520	5794520	And only maybe one or two times people were shitty.
5794520	5796520	But that's like really rare.
5796520	5798520	Like I haven't had a lot of those experiences.
5798520	5804520	I think a director can be shitty and be yelling at the crew and yelling at the Dolly grip that they miss the mark.
5804520	5807520	Like you do see that like somebody who is so obsessed with doing a good job.
5807520	5810520	They're mean to people around them.
5810520	5813520	But I think everyone has bad days where they do that.
5813520	5819520	Do you think you're good at cultivating like an environment of happiness and fun and grooviness?
5819520	5821520	I'm the least fun person on the set.
5821520	5822520	I'm not fun.
5822520	5827520	You know like I don't know how you are like you know when you're working on episodes and you're on set.
5827520	5831520	I am so nervous that the day is not going well.
5831520	5842520	But my main thought is I need to figure out a way to seem like I'm in an OK mood for everyone around me because what's in my head is so unplugged.
5842520	5843520	But that's good.
5843520	5854520	I find myself I get so easily fixated on what they're doing that and then I over time over a couple of seasons I objectively noticed because I love being in the edit bay.
5854520	5858520	And I love being in the writers room.
5858520	5864520	And then I would sometimes go to the set where they're shooting the things that you wrote in the writers room that you labor over and then that you're going to have to edit.
5864520	5883520	And what I would notice is that me on the set was like you might as well throw a bucket of chicken bones in the air and and adjust the set the way the chicken bones implied because because it was basically like it's like sometimes the chicken bones are going to be right.
5883520	5892520	Sometimes raw is like like outside of like any of it is like I'm not my instincts for actors and how to communicate with them like yeah.
5892520	5893520	Yeah.
5893520	5894520	Might as well roll the dice.
5894520	5896520	Well I agree with that to a point.
5896520	5901520	I you know when it shows going well you were shooting crashing right now.
5901520	5902520	We have great directors.
5902520	5907520	I don't feel like when I sit on the set it's essential to what's happening.
5907520	5911520	And you know I'm always thrilled when an episode comes in and it's incredible.
5911520	5912520	And I can go.
5912520	5914520	I was not there for one second.
5914520	5915520	Yeah.
5915520	5917520	I felt that funny people like I had that.
5917520	5918520	You know.
5918520	5922520	And I was like Judz Judz got his ass plopped in this director's chair.
5922520	5923520	It's like we're burning money here.
5923520	5925520	He could be off developing something.
5925520	5927520	I got this.
5927520	5928520	But but but yeah.
5928520	5933520	Is that the only time you've worked at the honest Kaminsky.
5933520	5934520	Wait I don't know.
5934520	5937520	That's a cinematographer who did the funny people.
5937520	5940520	And Lincoln.
5940520	5942520	Why are they always.
5942520	5943520	Polish.
5943520	5944520	Yeah.
5944520	5949520	Well I guess Polish like they're always like some.
5949520	5952520	They smoke cigarettes with their hand back.
5952520	5955520	Like why are they always from some.
5955520	5959520	He came to America and he's the best ever.
5959520	5964520	And the first movie he did was the vanilla ice movie Cool as Ice.
5964520	5967520	Which for my money holds up.
5967520	5968520	Yeah.
5968520	5974520	Cool as Ice is fucking like it's still it's still as true as it was the day it was made.
5974520	5977520	Is there any way I hate I hate this question.
5977520	5980520	I always like like we've connected with you.
5980520	5992520	You're at the you're at the top of the tornado which means you're either going to be flung off and be a cautionary tale of the velocity of a human body or or end up somewhere random.
5992520	6000520	I guess what part is the best part of the tornado to be in top top or top center and then you end up like it's like like Ripley's believe or not.
6000520	6003520	Judd Apatow was in Kansas when this tornado sucked him up.
6003520	6010520	He ended up sitting in Hawaii happily married as opposed to like fuck.
6010520	6011520	Which is what the.
6011520	6014520	But like he's so far so good.
6014520	6015520	Yeah.
6015520	6016520	You're doing all right.
6016520	6022520	You started like scrapping and wanting and you've been transparent about it.
6022520	6026520	Like there's one hundred and ninety people in here.
6026520	6028520	Some of them are surely bad people.
6028520	6030520	Some of them are good people.
6030520	6034520	A lot of them is you guys are all good people.
6034520	6044520	So is there is there is there any way to like like like like after all of these decades of you with these these rollercoasters like it's dumb.
6044520	6049520	It's like what's your advice to young people.
6049520	6052520	Well what is it you know.
6052520	6055520	You know what is the advice to young people.
6055520	6060520	It could take the form of like a more practical way of asking it because it might get a more sincere answer is what do you wish.
6060520	6064520	What do you wish you could poke your head through Dr. Strangehole and say what's your advice to Dan Harmon.
6064520	6066520	So he's not so freaked out right now.
6066520	6068520	Now what do you wish you could say to yourself.
6068520	6069520	Pick an age.
6069520	6071520	I mean if you want to pick 17.
6071520	6084520	Well I think you know the one thing that I got out of being around Gary was because I never thought about any of the things that he talked about before meeting him in terms of you right from a personal place.
6084520	6087520	You're trying to learn who you are through your creativity.
6087520	6090520	You know he was a guy who didn't.
6090520	6096520	He wasn't really part of the system like he made these shows but he didn't seem like he was a part of show business.
6096520	6103520	You know like he just did his things on the side and he was almost like an independent filmmaker in doing his TV shows.
6103520	6115520	And I think there's a lot to be said for caring that passionately about whatever you're doing and being willing to dig deep and then if you have something to say people might connect with it.
6115520	6120520	You can't really succeed if you're just trying to be a cog in the machine.
6120520	6125520	You're really trying to figure out what you want to express to other people.
6125520	6132520	And for me in a very simple way I think I'm over and over just trying to say you know don't be an asshole.
6132520	6133520	Try to be nicer.
6133520	6135520	Try to grow.
6135520	6139520	And that every movie is like a fucking idiot trying to be less of a fucking idiot.
6139520	6140520	You know and that's all it is.
6140520	6148520	And I'll think I'm reinventing the wheel and I'll sit in a story meeting and then by the end of the meeting we've kind of cracked a story and I'm like yeah it's just another version of that.
6148520	6150520	And that's what it is.
6150520	6156520	Do you notice that in your work like there's a common theme that no matter how hard you try to get away from it you're landing on it again.
6156520	6162520	No.
6162520	6163520	What are your themes.
6163520	6164520	Do you have any.
6164520	6168520	Dealing with being brilliant.
6168520	6177520	No control is it's like it's like it's sort of like every episode of community and Rick and Morty like it's so easy for it to come around to.
6177520	6180520	Oh we're talking about control versus not control.
6180520	6182520	And it always makes me feel like right.
6182520	6183520	Are we doing this right or wrong.
6183520	6188520	Is every story about the human ambition for control or are we fucking up.
6188520	6192520	Are we just like going back to a golf swing that is basically like killing our shoulder.
6192520	6194520	Like are we supposed to be different than this.
6194520	6197520	Are we supposed to be telling stories about fucking.
6197520	6203520	What happened to you that you're obsessed with the idea of control.
6203520	6206520	This is a whole different show.
6206520	6209520	Because I've never heard anyone talk about that as a theme.
6209520	6211520	But I'm fascinated about how it works.
6211520	6214520	Well because I'm terrified of being a control freak.
6214520	6216520	It's like like like more so than I.
6216520	6219520	It's it feels like I'm a control freak.
6219520	6222520	I feel like control freaks worry about not having control.
6222520	6227520	And I find myself waking up every day and going I'm I'm terrified I'm going to be a control freak.
6227520	6229520	I see. But we don't have. Come on.
6229520	6232520	We've got control freak. It's just like how you carry it.
6232520	6235520	Like I'm sure there's no difference between how I'm controlling things.
6235520	6236520	Now you're controlling things.
6236520	6238520	It's just how we're acting around the office.
6238520	6240520	Yes. Yes.
6240520	6248520	And that brings us to Twitter and this new age where it's like oh I'm like has any of this become cash in a bull.
6249520	6256520	Like like it is is the common man or lady.
6257520	6259520	You can be common.
6261520	6263520	Are they are.
6263520	6265520	Can I can I finish.
6265520	6268520	Like can it can they say you're all right.
6268520	6269520	You did it.
6269520	6273520	But but not mean you did it.
6273520	6279520	Like you made three branded content videos that won a Chloe.
6280520	6284520	You meaning like no because you did all that stuff.
6284520	6286520	All right. You're not gross anymore.
6286520	6291520	Like you're not like like I touch your hand in square dancing.
6291520	6294520	Like like I wouldn't.
6294520	6302520	That's not saying I date you but I wouldn't like I wouldn't I wouldn't go to the cafeteria and and and say I can't believe.
6302520	6307520	I had that beginning a fire credit required touching that person.
6307520	6308520	Yeah.
6308520	6313520	Can you can you can you ever take the journey that would like can you undo that.
6313520	6316520	Can you be less gross by making shit.
6317520	6318520	No.
6319520	6323520	I think you hate yourself in a different way than I hate myself.
6325520	6328520	Well that's not I wasn't even I was just kidding.
6332520	6350520	Well I could come back some time and can I have how much self loving goes into being a great like show creator like like like do you do you feel like like a little bit of self loving is a part of what you make.
6351520	6353520	I you know I think I got lucky.
6354520	6363520	You know you know I see my career in two phases which is I had all these shows canceled and I felt like they were good and I had movies that to do well like cable guy and heavyweights that I liked.
6363520	6367520	And I was like I think I'm out of sync with the world like the things that I like.
6367520	6373520	I think they are good but I don't think I guess I'm never going to transcend and connect with the audience.
6373520	6382520	And then I was lucky enough to be Paul Feig and we worked on freaks and geeks and then when that was over I had a very visceral sense that something magical had happened.
6382520	6393520	Like this is weird like this came out exactly the way we wanted to do it before the public reacted or was it it was disconnected from the reaction of the audience.
6393520	6403520	It was just a personal feeling like I think for me this is as good as I can do and I think it works perfectly the way we wanted it to.
6403520	6408520	And as a result I'm going to look at the rest of my career as like an aftermath.
6408520	6427520	And so like you know it's almost like a trick on myself like I did it once so I could take all that pressure off of myself and just try a bunch of shit because I really only wanted to prove to myself once that I knew what I was doing and everything else can be an experiment.
6428520	6432520	So identify the top of your Appetower.
6435520	6436520	No that didn't work.
6439520	6440520	Does that make any sense.
6441520	6443520	The connection of Appetower and then the word tower.
6444520	6445520	A little too much.
6446520	6447520	I'm good.
6448520	6449520	No I did.
6450520	6452520	Joel Hodgson came to an epiphany you know Joel.
6453520	6467520	Like about Mystery Science Theater like he had a love hate relationship with it because of what it represented in his life and so he kind of you you got lucky enough to sounds like you're in the edit band freaks and geeks and you're like you know what if I think it's going to get better than this.
6468520	6474520	I may be right I may be wrong but one thing's for certain I have unreasonable expectations if I compare.
6475520	6480520	That's how I feel about Rick and Morty is like I'm like I community was fucking perfect.
6481520	6493520	Therefore like I like Rick and Morty I'm like if you ever expect to be this happy about something you've made like like you're dumb.
6494520	6498520	And that doesn't mean you're not going to and it doesn't mean you you are.
6499520	6503520	It's like it's it's that it is that atoning with like good enough is good enough.
6504520	6508520	Yeah or just not even good enough just I'm giving myself to it.
6509520	6519520	I mean as creative as I can be and I have the courage to put that out there and we'll see what it is like I'm not holding back I'm not trying to obsess on how people are going to feel about it.
6519520	6524520	It's a pure expression because you're not you're not letting yourself be defined. I'm sorry that happens a lot.
6525520	6526520	I'm hidden.
6527520	6538520	But you find your like you're taking the pressure off yourself and you're not letting yourself be defined by your work so in that sense it's not about your ego it's really just about focusing on the thing that you're doing.
6539520	6543520	Can you get to that place right and then but there's always that other party that's like I'm gross.
6543520	6555520	You know you're where we carry what we're trying to let the dominant thing be I'm going to try to be in flow on whatever this creative expression is and put it out there and whatever whatever happens.
6556520	6561520	It's not fair to people to like it's like a writer on a contract with the audience inside.
6562520	6564520	Oh do you like that show Mighty Mouse. Yeah it's great.
6565520	6568520	Hey did you know the guy that created it wants you to think that he's a good person.
6568520	6574520	Well I don't know. I'm not prepared to have that conversation.
6575520	6584520	I'm what I'm very prepared to tell you is that I enjoyed Mighty Mouse episode three yesterday and may change my mind tomorrow and have a full fucking right to.
6585520	6589520	Yeah it's like that's the I think the lesson I just learned tonight and it really embarrassing.
6590520	6595520	But that's like the feel like your fuel to do the work sometimes is I'm gross.
6595520	6599520	I'm gross. Are we boring you. He just yawned. Oh yeah.
6600520	6609520	But that's like you're like you can't do the work unless you have some like insane wound you're trying to like overcompensate for it.
6610520	6618520	So the real question is at a certain age could you go. I can find a different fuel than this weird insecurity self hatred and do it from a different place.
6618520	6633520	Yeah yeah I mean the metaphors there would be it could include like aerospace or it's like it takes a different form of propulsion to get like you know to certain places and it's like things need to detach and take over or you're a bad rocket like you're flying on fucking diesel to the moon.
6634520	6639520	How does how does Dan get as mellow as you.
6640520	6655520	What could what could he learn from you how to be your worst nightmare needs to become a reality for that to happen because every seats filled in here because of my mania go ahead you can tell him go ahead tell him.
6657520	6665520	What would it take to make me I'm just saying calm the fuck down motherfucker. I'm not the one I've been I've been I've been like haven't we done too much show like.
6666520	6674520	I was the worst. Do you think you're in pre crazy prime crazy or post crazy.
6675520	6688520	It's like right at the tip of the Appetower like I'm I'm like I did I feel like I'm like I'm like right at the place which isn't it's like my therapist said to me she goes because she goes.
6689520	6695520	I describe all the joys of 70 episodes whatever I walked her through the merch.
6696520	6710520	I mentioned three times in my GQ article and she goes so next is happiness huh and I go yeah for sure pretty cool right and she's like huh.
6711520	6713520	Now this will be interesting this will be.
6714520	6727520	And I'm like what's that about and she goes no no no I just I'm saying it's going to be interesting because you're an archetype and about half of you.
6728520	6739520	That's true you now you become happy and now you just actually just grow to your randomly allotted age and you just die with a smile on your face or or or with a look of shock because maybe it's a bus.
6741520	6754520	But but but the other half to the point where you could flip a coin and she's very convincing I don't know if maybe she's bullshitting with the stuff but she's like she makes it sound like science is like the archetype you are in the situation you're in the half of you.
6754520	6768520	Half of you now you die now you put on slippers as she said and you drink yourself to death because you don't know how to process happiness and I was like all right.
6769520	6777520	And she's like yeah it's going to be going to be going to be interesting because what is your job cliffhanger.
6778520	6780520	Slippers full of poop.
6781520	6783520	Thank you so much hey we're a theater.
