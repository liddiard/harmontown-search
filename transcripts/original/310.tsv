0	7000	Hell yeah!
7000	16440	From the Bureau of Manhattan Community College, Tribeca Performing Arts Senator and the New
16440	22520	York Comedy Festival, Harmon Town is now in session.
23520	29520	How about we introduce our Game Master, Mrs. Spencer Crittenden.
36520	39520	Hello! Hello, Spencer.
40520	43520	You've got a really adorable little desk there.
43520	46520	Oh yeah, I'm owning my space.
47520	52520	Let's bring out your mayor, Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
61520	67520	Big apple, not too small. Big apple, buildings tall. Lots of windows, lots of cars.
67520	72520	Hey, the city, ours. Good to me.
73520	79520	Oh, all the New York history. George Washington once invaded.
84520	86520	The River. Third Street.
87520	91520	Patrick Henry had a birthday here.
92520	99520	Dan, you want to give us a little bit of some of your, you're known as kind of a New York, like, kind of a guide.
99520	102520	You're like the Anthony Bourdain of New York.
102520	107520	You know that podcast, The Bowery Boys? It's like a podcast and they talk about New York.
107520	114520	The living, thriving New York. When I listen to those guys, I'm like, it'd be nice if they knew a thing or two about the city.
114520	120520	Right. Where can I get the best spats? Spats.
120520	128520	1853, right at the prime, when Central Park was just a cattle ranch, that's when the spat was invented.
128520	139520	What happened is General MacArthur, who used, it was part of the sugar trust, he wanted to figure out a way to turn shoes into boots.
139520	146520	Because a lot of people don't understand this, but the sodium streetlights were highly combustible.
146520	152520	And so it was a sign of wealth if you were singed.
154520	161520	Because Fifth Avenue was basically a, before it was a candy bar, it was a fire hazard.
161520	175520	But it was where the wealthy lived, and so boots were less popular than shoes because how could you survive a sodium streetlight fire?
176520	189520	With your boots intact. So the wealthy liked to wear shoes, which a lot of people don't know this, where shoes were invented.
189520	201520	A shoe is a burnt boot. A shoe doesn't make any sense. Everything was a boot. And then this fashion thing happened.
201520	207520	It made it look like you were in a fire. So the more of the top of your shoe that was burnt off meant you were a sign of wealth.
207520	223520	The more, the nearer the Rockefellers you were, who in that day you could see dancing at the Green Mile over on Third and Crenshaw.
223520	246520	You know there were only three boroughs back then, representing the two gangs of New York, and of course the unofficial mayor of New York at that time, Butterfinger Boss Todd, and his famously corrupt mayor.
246520	250520	You were talking earlier, Dan, about why they call Wall Street Wall Street.
250520	254520	Right. Well, it was originally a wall.
254520	262520	It wasn't a street because it's where people were making money, and you don't want a street there. Poor people follow streets. You don't want them to go where your money goes.
262520	278520	And then there was a sort of famous squabble. They threw a bunch of ticker tape into the harbor, and the rich people said, what if it's a wall and a street? And Wall Street was born.
278520	284520	Just make it a street, but we'll call it Wall Street because it means if you're here, you're not welcome.
284520	290520	No, go ahead. You can take your trolley. You can make your lightning bike.
290520	294520	New York history. I'm just full of it.
294520	299520	Where's the best place in town for you to get a nice Chinese hotpot?
299520	305520	Well, I know a lot of people will tell you never to go above 103rd.
305520	311520	But the truth is, the Upper East is the new meat pack.
311520	319520	And I will find myself right between 95 and 97 on the corner of A&A.
319520	325520	The best wontons in the Duplo.
325520	329520	Look, we don't have a lot of time. We're ripping through. This is a festival set.
329520	336520	For those of you listening at home, you're going to be like, whoa, this podcast is really impressive.
336520	342520	No, we're just moving at a higher crisper pace because it's a festival energy.
342520	348520	We're in a packed house here. I think we're at the...
348520	352520	There's not a single empty seat.
352520	355520	Don't look it up. I believe we're at the...
355520	358520	I think tonight's attendance is 48,000 people tonight.
358520	364520	We're at the Metropolitan Opera House and we couldn't be...
364520	369520	A lot of you people could have been at Elton John tonight at Madison Square Garden, but no, they chose to be here.
369520	372520	And the fire department's been turning people away.
372520	375520	They can't fit all that people in here.
376520	383520	There was not to make light of awful, awful current mass shootings or the mass shooting du jour, but...
383520	386520	Maybe a little bit.
386520	397520	Well, no, what I think is odd is getting on a plane to go from California to New York and feeling safer because Griffith Park's on fire right now, as we speak.
397520	400520	My house is about to maybe burn down.
400520	404520	Yep. We've been keeping eyes on that all day.
405520	411520	It just feels nice to come out to a nice quiet evening in New York.
411520	413520	Yeah, man.
413520	415520	We've got it under control.
415520	417520	Where the stops are frisked.
422520	429520	Well, look, no guests. I'm not going to come to New York and bring out, like,
429520	433520	Oh, here's John Oliver. It easily could. That would be an easy thing I could do.
435520	438520	Butterfinger boss Todd is here tonight.
440520	445520	But it would take time. You know, he'd be playing catch up and all this stuff, but I...
445520	448520	Look, I brought Rob Shrob. Let's bring him in.
460520	461520	Look at this.
471520	473520	How does that feel?
473520	475520	What the fuck is going on here?
475520	477520	I'm good. What?
480520	484520	Did you bring enough gum for the rest of the class?
484520	488520	What is the... For the listeners, we're describing...
488520	490520	That's not my dick.
490520	494520	It looks like a walker had sex with a desk.
494520	497520	What is the little black plastic thing in front?
497520	500520	My dick's just popping out back here.
507520	510520	Photos are good podcasting.
511520	513520	I can't even think of...
513520	515520	He really can't.
515520	517520	What is the front plastic section?
517520	519520	It's to hide my dick.
521520	524520	And the microphone is glued to the top?
524520	528520	Or what? Well, why would you think that? That's a stupid thing.
528520	529520	Turn it upside down.
529520	530520	What?
530520	531520	Turn the desk upside down.
531520	533520	No, it's not stuck. Why would you think that?
533520	535520	It's a stupid thing to think.
536520	537520	Uh...
539520	540520	I'm looking at...
540520	542520	Don't make me move to the next stool.
542520	543520	Oh, God.
544520	546520	You were saying, Dan, I'm so sorry.
547520	549520	This is kind of a rear show, because usually...
549520	551520	I mean, it's not the first time coming to New York.
551520	553520	We take the show on the road. We love going places.
553520	561520	But this is probably the first show that if we talk about the flight out here,
561520	563520	it's the only thing we're ever going to talk about.
563520	564520	That's good, though. That's a good show.
565520	566520	You guys don't know what happened.
566520	569520	We burned a lot of material on the way over here.
569520	571520	I'm going to give you some headlines.
571520	575520	And at first, in the interest of the...
577520	580520	We took a limo to LAX from Los Feliz, and we got...
580520	584520	You get into one of these limos, and there's an ice thing,
584520	587520	and there's some glasses, and I'm like...
587520	589520	Every time I get...
589520	591520	I go like, well, then we should have booze.
591520	592520	I don't know what that is.
592520	594520	I think it's called alcoholism.
594520	597520	But you see ice, and then you see glasses, and then you're like,
597520	598520	well, then I get...
598520	601520	Okay, so then I go and get a bottle of vodka,
601520	606520	and I get a bottle of Fernet Bronco, which is that Hitler medicine
606520	610520	that Jeff's always talking about if you're a fan of the podcast.
610520	613520	Is it fixed or Hitler yet?
613520	615520	You came down with some Hitler.
615520	618520	I had a 24-hour Hitler.
620520	621520	Hitler medicine!
623520	627520	And we're just drinking in the traffic on the way to LAX,
627520	628520	and we're having a good time.
628520	629520	And we were fine.
629520	631520	We were listening to Celine Dion.
631520	633520	There was a CD in the limo.
633520	635520	I think that's the last time the limo was used.
635520	640520	You were playing the Little Mermaid soundtrack as loud as it could go.
640520	645520	You and Cody were screaming along a different song,
645520	647520	different lyrics to the song.
647520	650520	I do. I remember everything up until about...
651520	653520	Do you remember me going, maybe another song?
653520	654520	Maybe a different one?
654520	655520	Yeah.
655520	657520	I knew it was starting with Cody a bit.
657520	659520	She goes, like, play Chicago.
659520	663520	What's the song where he had it coming,
663520	666520	and I'm like, play he had it coming.
666520	668520	And Jeff's like, it's called he had it coming?
668520	669520	I don't know.
669520	671520	And it's not called he had it coming.
671520	673520	It's a cell block tango.
673520	676520	But it's like Cody kind of...
676520	679520	I can see I've been with her for many years,
679520	682520	and I can kind of start to see, like...
682520	685520	It's usually an adorable amount of, like,
685520	687520	when the Gary Busey starts to come out.
687520	689520	Can I just stop here?
689520	692520	When she starts to become...
692520	695520	There's lines being drawn in the sand for no reason.
695520	697520	Let me just paint one picture.
697520	701520	Also, Cody is dressed like a garage mechanic.
701520	706520	She has this comfortable, very sexy for how comfortable
706520	708520	and practical it is.
708520	710520	Usually those things don't overlap,
710520	712520	but in the middle of that Venn diagram...
712520	715520	Bright pink chrome shoes, dressed like a mechanic...
715520	718520	She looks like a mechanic from Knight Rider, yeah.
718520	720520	Arms everywhere.
720520	722520	And she's like, you know, she's like, put it on that song.
722520	723520	I love that song.
723520	726520	And then that song starts, and it starts with, like,
726520	729520	pop, swish, schwartz, Cicero, or whatever.
729520	730520	You know, that's right.
730520	734520	And Cody's of all the songs to defiantly pretend
734520	736520	you know the lyrics to...
737520	739520	Pop, Cicero, schwartz.
739520	741520	You're just saying what you're hearing.
741520	743520	You don't know the song anyways.
743520	744520	But we're like...
744520	746520	So we roll up to LAX, and I'm like...
746520	748520	Now, if I can hit pause here,
748520	751520	this is the last thing I remember.
751520	753520	And this is, like, the foreword of the story.
753520	754520	Right.
754520	757520	Because the stars of the story that emerge
757520	761520	are gonna be Jeff Davis and Cody Heller and...
761520	763520	It's Steve Levy.
763520	768520	I would call it a tale of two kinds of drunk.
768520	769520	I don't know what happened.
769520	771520	Like, I feel like I roofied myself.
771520	772520	You drank a lot and got drunk.
772520	773520	That's what happened.
773520	774520	Yeah, but I was...
774520	776520	But, like, I disappeared.
776520	777520	I became...
777520	778520	Right, we'll get there.
778520	779520	I think it's...
779520	780520	He disappeared.
780520	783520	It's actually a rare story that's actually
783520	785520	probably most important to just cut ahead.
785520	787520	It's like one of those, like,
787520	797520	Jeff will be awoken by LAX police on a bench
797520	799520	and ask him,
799520	801520	where are you going?
801520	804520	And his answer will be Los Angeles.
804520	806520	And they will say,
806520	808520	you're in Los Angeles,
808520	811520	and where are you going?
811520	814520	And after a while, they'll arrive at New York.
814520	817520	No, no, they got me there.
817520	818520	They pitched in New York.
818520	819520	They said, where are you going?
819520	821520	I paused and I thought about it.
821520	823520	I said, I don't know.
823520	825520	I thought I was coming home.
825520	827520	See, because what happened...
827520	829520	What we've pieced together...
829520	831520	I can tell you the subjective things.
831520	833520	I can tell you that I last saw Jeff and Cody.
833520	836520	We got split up into the TSA checkpoint line.
836520	838520	I looked over, these are my friends.
838520	839520	I'm having a great time.
839520	840520	I'm actually...
840520	842520	I thought I was gonna be the self-destructive rock star
842520	845520	because I'm in my anti-TSA mode
845520	846520	where I'm just like,
846520	848520	I can't understand what you're saying.
848520	850520	You have to take your laptop out of the bag.
850520	852520	The guy goes to Dan,
852520	855520	sir, can I look in your bag?
855520	857520	And Dan goes, what if I say no?
857520	859520	And I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ.
859520	861520	That's how drunk I was.
861520	863520	I'm like, oh, God.
863520	866520	He's the third drunkest person in this store.
866520	871520	I was like, okay, I'm just gonna fight the government.
871520	872520	Let me answer.
872520	873520	Let me answer that question.
873520	876520	I end up being the Matthew Broderick in this story.
876520	880520	I end up being the Anthony Michael Hall of this breakfast club.
880520	883520	And I'm like, what are you gonna do?
883520	886520	Take me to Guantanamo?
886520	889520	So I get through that line,
889520	891520	and then Cody somehow,
891520	894520	maybe it got activated by the backscatter machine.
894520	898520	Like, she's a marionette of Courtney Love
898520	900520	when she gets to the other side.
900520	906520	And the only person holding the strings is God.
906520	911520	And God is not a good puppeteer.
911520	912520	He's not.
912520	914520	But I don't want to derail us with that stuff.
914520	915520	We'll get back to that.
915520	917520	We'll get back to your theories about God.
917520	923520	We get up to the lounge where Cody's like...
923520	924520	Something's happened.
924520	925520	It's like a delayed...
925520	927520	It takes 20 minutes.
927520	929520	We were over-served in the limo.
929520	933520	And it must just be hitting her,
933520	937520	and she's getting unable to be motile,
937520	940520	and she's starting to like...
940520	944520	She's just like making sounds,
944520	952520	and all you can register is that she's defiant about something.
952520	954520	And then I'm like not...
954520	956520	I'm not a good person either.
956520	960520	Like, you get to do your impression of me.
960520	961520	Yeah, yeah, go, Shropp.
961520	963520	Shropp has the best version of this story.
963520	965520	Well, I see...
965520	966520	Because I'm looking around, and I'm seeing a guy...
966520	967520	Shropp's the most so...
967520	970520	If I see Cody being loosey-goosey in a fluorescent-lit lounge
970520	973520	at 6 p.m., like, and then I see a guy across from her
973520	975520	going like this...
975520	977520	Maybe that guy's playing Pokemons,
977520	979520	but maybe he's TMZ, and I'm just like...
979520	982520	I don't want to feel protective.
982520	984520	Anyway, chaos.
984520	986520	We get into the lounge, chaos, chaos, chaos.
986520	988520	I'm like, here's my ticket.
988520	990520	Oh, you're in first class. Go ahead.
990520	991520	All right, that's great.
991520	994520	I, you know, I start walking.
994520	997520	I turn around enough in time to see Cody
997520	1000520	going to the woman across the counter to go,
1000520	1003520	what up, bitch?
1003520	1004520	What up, bitch?
1004520	1007520	And I'm like, oh, my God.
1007520	1010520	And just to give you an indication of how...
1011520	1014520	That bitch's response was in German.
1014520	1016520	It was like she was just...
1016520	1018520	There was absolutely no way that she...
1018520	1020520	We don't have the papers.
1020520	1022520	Well, German maybe evokes that stuff.
1022520	1024520	I'm saying, like, make her Swiss.
1024520	1026520	But she was a tourist.
1026520	1028520	She didn't speak English because her response
1028520	1030520	to what up, bitch, was...
1030520	1032520	What is happening?
1032520	1036520	I came here for the gummy bears and the Seattle needle.
1037520	1040520	My brain goes blank with deuce chills.
1040520	1042520	I'm just going to...
1042520	1044520	And I turn away and then I turn back again
1044520	1047520	in time for you to catch you saying
1047520	1049520	to the Swiss German woman,
1049520	1052520	look, we don't work here,
1052520	1056520	and you're acting like we're supposed to know this stuff.
1056520	1058520	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1058520	1059520	Holy shit.
1059520	1060520	You're confusing.
1060520	1062520	I'm not saying that to the tourists.
1062520	1064520	I was saying that to the people at the counter
1064520	1065520	that work for the airline.
1065520	1067520	Yeah, wasn't she the Swiss German woman?
1067520	1069520	No, Cody wasn't saying what a bitch to a person
1069520	1070520	that worked for the airline.
1070520	1072520	She was saying it to some poor bystander
1072520	1074520	who was also sitting in the reading area.
1074520	1076520	Okay, well, I was far away.
1076520	1080520	I didn't see that part, so I'm glad we had this discussion.
1080520	1081520	We're piecing it together.
1081520	1082520	Right.
1082520	1084520	Well, the great thing is, again, it gets worse.
1084520	1086520	So, Cody...
1086520	1089520	So, Cody is like...
1089520	1091520	And she lost her boarding pass at this point, right?
1091520	1094520	And her footing, she fell down a couple of times.
1096520	1098520	We all love Cody, by the way.
1098520	1099520	Yeah, we love Cody.
1099520	1102520	You do a little non-linear storytelling thing here
1102520	1104520	because the whole time there's also this, like,
1104520	1107520	the sideline of, like, Steve...
1107520	1109520	Levi is...
1109520	1110520	Right, we have a mention.
1110520	1111520	He's doing this, like, get him to the Greek
1111520	1115520	if there's, like, eight Russell...
1115520	1117520	Russell brands.
1117520	1120520	And the theme I keep hearing is, like,
1120520	1122520	well, can you try to...
1122520	1124520	I'm gonna try to find Jeff.
1124520	1127520	And I just keep thinking, like, where's Jeff?
1127520	1128520	Where's Jeff?
1128520	1129520	Where's Jeff?
1129520	1131520	And then later, Jeff, while we were driving here,
1131520	1133520	Jeff's listening to the stories about Cody,
1133520	1136520	and then Jeff at one point goes...
1136520	1139520	He goes, oh, well, maybe I was there,
1139520	1140520	and that's why I left?
1140520	1144520	And Sharab goes, no, you were gone in the Star Wars crawl.
1144520	1146520	You were...
1146520	1150520	He goes, you were the silver C-3PO.
1150520	1153520	Which is true, because what we pieced together
1153520	1156520	is here's what Jeff did.
1156520	1159520	Jeff was in the TSA checkpoint.
1159520	1160520	The TSA checkpoint.
1160520	1161520	We think he got through security.
1161520	1164520	I was pretty sure he got through the X-ray machine.
1164520	1167520	Right, he was just in a line and then disappeared.
1167520	1171520	And then fate turned his body physically around enough
1171520	1176520	that 40 years of touring and landing at LAX
1176520	1182520	and eight quarts of Fernet Branca broke his sim,
1182520	1186520	and he ended up just walking...
1186520	1188520	Oh, I'm at LAX, we're home.
1188520	1190520	From the fucking X-ray machine.
1190520	1191520	Better call an Uber.
1191520	1193520	And he called a Lyft.
1193520	1194520	And he did call a Lyft.
1194520	1199520	And he woke up on a bench three hours later by stun baton.
1199520	1202520	Between getting out of the limo,
1202520	1206520	the next thing I remember is police tapping me on the shoulder.
1206520	1209520	I was sitting downstairs outside at a rivals,
1209520	1211520	and a cop is going,
1211520	1214520	Sir, your friends are looking for you.
1214520	1216520	Because Steve Levy called the fuzz.
1216520	1218520	Because here's the thing.
1218520	1219520	Spencer.
1219520	1222520	I was in New York when this was all happening.
1222520	1224520	I was already in New York in a hotel room.
1224520	1228520	Because for some reason Spencer doesn't like to travel with us.
1231520	1232520	Right.
1232520	1234520	So...
1234520	1236520	I put foam on all the sharp corners and stuff.
1236520	1240520	It was two LAX cops that tap me on the shoulder and go,
1240520	1243520	Hey, your friend, they moved your flight, come with us.
1243520	1247520	Because Steve is now boarding the flight that is leaving without Jeff.
1247520	1250520	And he's like, Spencer, Jeff is missing.
1250520	1252520	Can you call someone?
1252520	1256520	And not only did I have nine texts from Steve,
1256520	1260520	I had four or five texts from the Lyft driver that I called,
1260520	1263520	because I was going to go home.
1263520	1265520	And she's like, I'm here.
1265520	1266520	Where are you?
1266520	1267520	I'm upstairs.
1267520	1268520	What the fuck?
1268520	1272520	And I called the car thinking I was leaving the goddamn thing.
1272520	1276520	So the cops bring me back in to Alaska Airlines.
1276520	1278520	And they go, okay, we have a flight for you.
1278520	1281520	You're going to be in first class till there's one seat available.
1281520	1283520	And the woman says...
1283520	1285520	And the cop says, Sir, where are you going?
1285520	1287520	And I said, Los Angeles.
1287520	1290520	And he goes, you're in Los Angeles.
1290520	1291520	Where are you going?
1291520	1294520	And I went, I don't know.
1295520	1297520	And then we all laughed.
1297520	1299520	The cops and the lady.
1299520	1301520	We all had a good laugh about it.
1301520	1303520	I said, look, I've been on tour a lot,
1303520	1305520	and I'm very disoriented right now.
1305520	1306520	I don't know what's going on.
1306520	1308520	Disoriented.
1308520	1311520	I tour a lot every Friday night, too.
1311520	1313520	I lost my compass.
1313520	1315520	I'm going to tour after I get done with you.
1315520	1317520	Somehow, because Levi is awesome,
1317520	1321520	and he got me a driver from JFK,
1321520	1325520	I somehow managed to make it to our hotel with my bags
1325520	1327520	and all of my stuff.
1327520	1329520	We thought you were going to come out on the carousel
1329520	1331520	when we got to New York.
1331520	1332520	We were a torture.
1332520	1335520	But I just realized we're committing a major podcast crime,
1335520	1338520	like all the true crime shows that focus on the murderers
1338520	1340520	and not enough on the victims.
1340520	1343520	I want to bring out Steve Levi.
1343520	1345520	Because...
1345520	1347520	Levi.
1352520	1354520	Awesome.
1354520	1356520	Because he was the only sober one,
1356520	1359520	and we were only able to piece all this together
1359520	1361520	by asking him questions.
1361520	1362520	I'm so sorry.
1362520	1364520	Can we have Steve Levi come back on?
1364520	1366520	I have a different music drop for you.
1366520	1368520	Oh, damn.
1368520	1369520	I'm so sorry.
1369520	1370520	This will just take a second.
1370520	1371520	Can you play it through your mic?
1371520	1372520	I can try.
1372520	1373520	All right.
1373520	1375520	Steve Levi, everybody.
1382520	1384520	Wasn't this so much better?
1384520	1386520	Thank you, Spencer.
1386520	1387520	That's a good theme for you.
1387520	1390520	A muffled, muted distance.
1390520	1391520	That's what he deserves.
1391520	1394520	He doesn't deserve a generic sound clip.
1394520	1395520	All right.
1395520	1396520	So, all's well done as well.
1396520	1398520	Steve Levi gets me on the plane.
1398520	1399520	I get the car home.
1399520	1400520	I make it.
1400520	1401520	But meanwhile, there's a whole...
1401520	1404520	The A story is still happening aboard the original flight.
1404520	1407520	Yeah, because most of the story happens while you're unconscious.
1408520	1410520	Yeah, it's more fun to talk about Cody,
1410520	1413520	but that's because we have answers about her.
1413520	1416520	You went into the black hole.
1416520	1417520	I did.
1417520	1418520	I think I roofied myself.
1418520	1420520	I don't know what happened.
1420520	1423520	I got to tell you, I went to the University of Miami,
1423520	1429520	and when I was there, we won Playboy Party School of the Year,
1429520	1432520	and I had a lot of training.
1432520	1434520	I had a lot of training.
1434520	1437520	Being the only silver person at that school.
1437520	1441520	Dealing with the most drunken people,
1441520	1444520	and I really got to use those tools last night
1444520	1445520	that I sharpened.
1445520	1446520	You were great.
1446520	1448520	Some highlights that I wasn't there for,
1448520	1451520	because eventually I had to leave Cody in the lounge
1451520	1452520	because I was like,
1452520	1455520	you people who I've not met, but hello.
1455520	1458520	Including Ruthie Aslan's cousin.
1458520	1461520	Ruthie Aslan was a community editor.
1461520	1464520	She was my right hand on a lot of amazing stuff I made,
1464520	1465520	and her cousin's here.
1465520	1466520	Shout out to her.
1466520	1467520	Or I don't know if her cousin's there.
1467520	1468520	You know what?
1468520	1469520	You can be Ruthie's cousin and be a guy.
1469520	1470520	It's a new world.
1470520	1472520	Whoa.
1472520	1478520	Shout out to cousins for being inherently non-binary.
1478520	1482520	Fuck your heteronormative nephews and nieces.
1482520	1483520	Better bread, better stuff.
1483520	1485520	Cousins are where it's at.
1485520	1487520	I'm not sure.
1487520	1488520	They can be anything.
1488520	1489520	All right.
1489520	1490520	Anyways.
1490520	1491520	My time.
1491520	1492520	I'm sorry.
1492520	1495520	I don't want this show to go by without people knowing
1495520	1497520	that my girlfriend on the bridge,
1497520	1498520	what did they call it?
1498520	1499520	The jet bridge?
1499520	1500520	She made it.
1500520	1502520	I never thought you would get her that far.
1502520	1503520	That you had to...
1503520	1504520	Well, let's go back.
1504520	1505520	Let's start from...
1505520	1506520	First warning.
1506520	1507520	Let's do a little...
1507520	1508520	I mean, this is a little weird.
1508520	1509520	I'm sorry.
1509520	1510520	I'm sorry.
1510520	1511520	I don't want this show to go by without people knowing
1511520	1513520	that my girlfriend on the bridge to the...
1513520	1514520	What did they call the bridge-y thing?
1514520	1515520	The jet bridge?
1515520	1516520	She made it...
1516520	1517520	This is a little...
1517520	1518520	I mean, this is a little Rashomon, right?
1518520	1519520	Like, let me...
1519520	1520520	Right, right, right, right.
1520520	1521520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1521520	1522520	I just wanted...
1522520	1526520	She saw a baby in a stroller and said way too loud,
1526520	1528520	look at that fucking baby.
1528520	1529520	She was...
1529520	1532520	I was standing Cody up against the wall
1532520	1533520	and I was looking at Cody.
1533520	1535520	I was like, Codes, tell me something.
1535520	1537520	And then she sees this baby.
1537520	1539520	It's about two feet to her right.
1539520	1542520	She goes, look at this fucking baby.
1542520	1544520	Like, just an inch away from touching its hand.
1544520	1547520	And the mother's just like, oh, no.
1547520	1548520	That's what Cody does.
1548520	1550520	Cody drinks too much.
1550520	1553520	She becomes Richard Dawson from the 70s Family Feud.
1553520	1554520	She just keeps...
1554520	1558520	She keeps welcoming people to her drunkabird.
1558520	1561520	So when she got on the plane, she looked over
1561520	1564520	and there were two incredibly handsome gay dudes
1564520	1565520	who were like...
1565520	1566520	Like, they were very...
1566520	1568520	They were as...
1568520	1570520	The reason I know they were gay is because
1570520	1573520	if two straight guys that handsome were hanging out
1573520	1575520	together, they...
1575520	1576520	It's just not possible.
1576520	1577520	Well, that's not true.
1577520	1579520	When you and I hang out, it's no...
1579520	1580520	It's not a big deal.
1580520	1581520	They were a very...
1581520	1582520	But they were...
1582520	1583520	They were...
1583520	1587520	They were clean cut, like straight edge kind of looking guys
1587520	1588520	and...
1588520	1592520	But just actually strikingly chiseled and handsome.
1592520	1598520	But these are the thoughts you keep in your head.
1598520	1601520	But not when you're America's aunt,
1601520	1604520	my girlfriend after a drink,
1604520	1606520	who comes on the plane...
1606520	1607520	I sit her down.
1607520	1608520	And she sits...
1608520	1611520	She plops down on the seat and looks over at those guys
1611520	1612520	and goes like,
1612520	1616520	Whoa, look at these good looking fellas.
1616520	1617520	Look at these handsome guys.
1617520	1618520	Look at these handsome guys.
1618520	1619520	They're very handsome.
1619520	1620520	They're very handsome.
1620520	1621520	What are you...
1621520	1622520	Where are you guys?
1622520	1623520	You guys going to Alaska?
1623520	1627520	Because we're on Alaska Airlines?
1627520	1633520	And they go, no, are you going to Alaska?
1633520	1636520	Is that how they dress in Alaska now?
1636520	1638520	Are you skipping over part of that baby encounter?
1638520	1639520	I'm skipping over a million things.
1639520	1641520	This is a post Netflix audience.
1641520	1642520	They can handle it.
1642520	1647520	Did you know that Jonah Hill's character was actually an octopus after...
1647520	1649520	Wasn't there a much more important thing with the baby?
1649520	1650520	No, there's a million important things.
1650520	1652520	I just wanted to make sure.
1652520	1653520	Some of these things I'm like,
1653520	1656520	I just want people to know how much I love my girlfriend
1656520	1657520	and why they're like...
1657520	1666520	I like that even the worst case scenario with my girlfriend is dark Bill Murray.
1666520	1669520	That she's like, look at this fucking baby.
1669520	1673520	And then she kind of like was starting to unzip her...
1673520	1679520	She halfway unzipped her jumper and her boobs were out a little bit.
1679520	1680520	And I don't know what...
1680520	1681520	Why did you do that?
1681520	1682520	She's trying to feed the baby.
1682520	1683520	Yeah, she's like, hey, kid.
1683520	1684520	Hey, kid.
1684520	1685520	Come over here.
1685520	1691520	So after she plops down and says, take a look at these good looking dudes.
1691520	1693520	And they're going, oh, okay, right, whatever.
1693520	1697520	And I'm sitting like a row or two behind.
1697520	1701520	And then so for the next hour I hear, go to sleep.
1701520	1702520	Go to sleep.
1702520	1703520	That's me.
1703520	1704520	That's great.
1704520	1705520	Go to sleep.
1705520	1706520	Go to sleep.
1706520	1707520	Go to sleep.
1707520	1708520	Go to sleep.
1708520	1709520	Why?
1709520	1710520	Are you going to break up with me?
1710520	1711520	Go to sleep.
1711520	1712520	Go to sleep.
1712520	1713520	Go to sleep.
1713520	1714520	Go to sleep.
1714520	1716520	But she never went to sleep.
1716520	1717520	No.
1717520	1720520	She just sat there and kept...
1720520	1726520	And every once in a while look over at me like my dad after eight southern comforts when
1726520	1727520	I was 10.
1727520	1728520	Like I would just get this...
1728520	1731520	Feel this glare and I would go to sleep.
1731520	1733520	I did nothing for five hours.
1733520	1739520	I pretended to look at my phone while I was like, you're drunk too.
1739520	1741520	You don't get mad.
1741520	1744520	God, just go to sleep and wake up normal.
1744520	1746520	But she never did.
1746520	1750520	She just slowly got more charismatic.
1750520	1753520	And she had best friends with the flight attendants.
1753520	1754520	She was like...
1754520	1755520	I'm fine.
1755520	1756520	I'm fine.
1756520	1757520	Yeah, I know you're fine.
1757520	1760520	I hate you.
1760520	1765520	Dan's in the lounge going, I don't know what to do.
1765520	1767520	I'm waving my options.
1767520	1769520	You're a piece of celery right now.
1769520	1770520	You're a piece of celery.
1770520	1772520	I want to dump you in a dumpster.
1772520	1774520	You're going to dump me?
1774520	1776520	Why?
1776520	1781520	Just like, oh my God, I want to die.
1781520	1786520	Whereas I, like a gentleman, was just having a nice little nap outside on a bench.
1786520	1791520	Levi, do something to mitigate that glimpse he just gave these people of me talking to
1791520	1793520	my girlfriend when she's incapacitated.
1793520	1794520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1794520	1798520	So here's my side of this crazy story.
1798520	1799520	Just even it up.
1799520	1802520	So we get through security.
1802520	1804520	Jeff is not nowhere to be found.
1804520	1809520	I'm like, well, look, Jeff, one thing about Jeff is every time we travel, he always splits
1809520	1810520	up from the group and goes so far.
1810520	1813520	Oh, yeah, first thing that happens when we get through security is Jeff's gone.
1813520	1815520	He just ditches us and goes and reads a book somewhere.
1815520	1818520	No, it's to go read Moby Dick in the coolest bar in your city so you can come out here
1818520	1820520	and say, oh, I love the penny pincher.
1820520	1823520	And you guys go, oh, that's wow, that's extra cool.
1823520	1828520	I can't believe you read a Cormac McCarthy book in the fucking phone booth cafe.
1829520	1834520	So our little touring family was like, look, this is what Jeff does is what Jeff does.
1834520	1838520	I was going, no, he did not make it through security.
1838520	1840520	I think Jeff's the grown up.
1840520	1844520	And I knew I had to get them to the lounge.
1844520	1846520	So I get them to the lounge.
1846520	1852520	We had the altercation at the front desk where we couldn't get in because she lost her boarding
1852520	1853520	pass, right?
1853520	1854520	Cody lost her boarding pass.
1854520	1857520	Dan didn't know which card he had to give to get us into the lounge.
1857520	1858520	Bob was already checked in.
1858520	1860520	Cody was going, this bitch.
1860520	1863520	She's got to this fucking bitch.
1863520	1867520	And the lady is just like, she's not going to make it on this.
1867520	1870520	They will not let her on the flight if she's like this.
1870520	1872520	And then I'm like, God, fuck.
1872520	1875520	Okay, well, this changes my night entirely.
1875520	1878520	Then we realize how bad the situation is.
1878520	1879520	Dan sits Cody down.
1879520	1880520	She's stumbling.
1880520	1882520	She could barely stand up at this point.
1882520	1885520	She's stumbling while sitting down.
1885520	1886520	Yeah.
1886520	1895520	She was in danger of missing the chair she had been sitting in for 10 minutes.
1895520	1898520	She was still in the process of sitting in it.
1898520	1899520	Shrub.
1899520	1902520	Shrub's texting me, what's the Wi-Fi?
1902520	1904520	What's the Wi-Fi?
1904520	1905520	I got to send an email.
1905520	1906520	What's the Wi-Fi?
1906520	1907520	A man is dead.
1907520	1908520	I'm being pretty quiet.
1908520	1909520	I'm being pretty quiet.
1909520	1910520	I'm like, oh, look at these lunatics.
1910520	1912520	And I'm like, hey, I can't figure it out.
1912520	1915520	There's signs, literally, a billboard right ahead of me.
1915520	1920520	The Wi-Fi password is what's the Wi-Fi password?
1920520	1923520	I say to the group, I got to find Jeff.
1923520	1924520	They're like, you're being ridiculous.
1924520	1925520	Jeff is fine.
1925520	1927520	No, I got to find Jeff.
1927520	1932520	So I go down and I look at every airport bar, no Jeff to be found.
1932520	1933520	I call Spencer.
1933520	1936520	I'm like, I know you just got to the hotel.
1936520	1937520	I can't find Spencer.
1937520	1938520	I can't find Jeff.
1938520	1941520	I might have to call you in a little bit to help me with this one.
1941520	1943520	I'll let you know how things go.
1943520	1945520	Cody's really blasted, too.
1945520	1946520	We may not make it on this flight.
1946520	1949520	I don't know what the hell is going to happen.
1949520	1952520	And then I get back up to the lounge.
1952520	1953520	Cody's gotten worse.
1953520	1956520	She's wearing her black glasses and she's like...
1956520	1957520	I thought that was cool.
1957520	1960520	I was like, oh, now she looks like a Kennedy widow.
1960520	1964520	Yeah, she's like, yeah.
1964520	1966520	I thought that was cool.
1966520	1969520	Maybe this is probably a terrible codependent relationship,
1969520	1973520	but I was kind of turned on some of the time.
1973520	1975520	I called Jeff about ten times.
1975520	1977520	Couldn't get in touch with him.
1977520	1978520	I called Church.
1978520	1980520	She hadn't heard from him.
1980520	1982520	And then the flight starts boarding.
1982520	1985520	And I'm like, Rob, you guys have to get on this flight.
1985520	1986520	I turn to Dan.
1986520	1988520	I'm like, flight's boarding.
1988520	1989520	You know, we have to make a decision.
1989520	1994520	And Dan's like, to Cody, Cody, I love you.
1994520	1997520	I think the best thing for me to do is cancel this show,
1997520	2002520	take you home, take care of you, because you're not going to...
2002520	2004520	Yeah, give him the mic, swap mics.
2004520	2005520	You're cutting it out?
2005520	2007520	Yeah, yeah, give him the other mic.
2007520	2008520	All right.
2008520	2010520	Now you take the other mic on the screen.
2010520	2012520	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
2012520	2013520	You got it, you got it.
2013520	2018520	You know, a lot of people could do that without any words.
2018520	2023520	So he looks at me, what am I doing?
2023520	2026520	I can't deal with it.
2026520	2028520	They're not going to let her on this flight look at her.
2028520	2029520	She can't stand up.
2029520	2032520	I said, I got it.
2032520	2033520	Don't worry about it.
2033520	2034520	Don't even...
2034520	2035520	Just get on the flight.
2035520	2036520	Don't...
2036520	2037520	You know, I'll figure it out.
2037520	2038520	I'll figure it out.
2038520	2041520	Dan goes, I don't know how you're going to figure this out.
2041520	2044520	But, okay, I don't want to cancel this show.
2044520	2046520	There's going to be hundreds of people.
2046520	2047520	It sucks.
2047520	2049520	I don't want to go to New York without Cody.
2049520	2050520	He turns to Cody.
2050520	2052520	He tells her that he loves her about 12 times.
2052520	2055520	He kisses her and he goes, I'm so sorry.
2055520	2058520	Levi's going to figure this one out somehow.
2058520	2060520	And he goes, and I look at Cody.
2060520	2062520	I'm like, codes, it's you and me, bros tonight.
2062520	2065520	We're going to figure this out somehow.
2065520	2066520	Where's her boarding pass?
2066520	2068520	She's like, I don't know.
2068520	2070520	I had printed her a second boarding pass at this point.
2070520	2073520	She lost this one.
2073520	2076520	I was like, okay, Cody, we're going to get on this flight.
2076520	2077520	It's boarding.
2077520	2078520	Don't even trip.
2078520	2079520	I got to find Jeff.
2079520	2080520	She's like, yeah, what?
2080520	2082520	Jeff, where is that guy?
2082520	2084520	Like, are we going to make this flight?
2084520	2087520	What's Jeff doing?
2087520	2089520	And so I go and I talk to the lady at the front.
2089520	2092520	I'm like, I need three seats on the next flight.
2092520	2095520	She's like, there's only one first-class seat
2095520	2097520	for the next three flights to New York.
2097520	2100520	I was like, I don't think I'm going to make it on this flight
2100520	2104520	without losing one of my team.
2104520	2106520	I just want to pause here and point out
2106520	2112520	that a podcast flying across a first-world country
2112520	2116520	to do a 90-minute show shouldn't have a casualty ratio
2116520	2123520	as high as a police action in the 70s in a third-world country.
2123520	2126520	I think Spencer's like, did you guys get on the plane?
2126520	2129520	I'm like, yeah, there's some casualties.
2129520	2135520	I think seven of us came, five of us are going to be at JFK.
2135520	2138520	Yeah, so I was like, I had to make a decision.
2138520	2141520	Do I try to find Jeff or do I just try to get Cody on this flight?
2141520	2143520	The woman at the front was like, you got to do your best
2143520	2145520	at getting her on the flight.
2145520	2147520	Just don't have her say a word.
2147520	2151520	Try to make her walk as best as she can.
2151520	2152520	And you can do it.
2152520	2154520	You can get her on this flight.
2154520	2156520	Everyone's rooting for you guys.
2156520	2157520	I'm going to get her on the flight.
2157520	2158520	So I go to Cody.
2158520	2161520	I was like, codes, we got to go board this flight.
2161520	2162520	We're going to be late.
2162520	2163520	She's like, all right, let's do it.
2163520	2164520	I'm really tired.
2164520	2165520	I got to pee.
2165520	2166520	I was like, we got to just wait.
2166520	2168520	We got to wait till we get on the flight.
2168520	2170520	She's like, can I wear my glasses?
2170520	2171520	You better wear those glasses.
2171520	2173520	You look so fucking cool.
2173520	2175520	So I stand Cody up.
2175520	2176520	She staggers a little bit.
2176520	2179520	I'm like, here, here, hold my arm.
2179520	2181520	And so I lead her to the elevator.
2181520	2182520	We get in.
2182520	2183520	She's very talky.
2183520	2184520	She's like, what's happening?
2184520	2185520	Are we going to make this flight?
2185520	2187520	Where's Jeff?
2187520	2190520	Do these glasses make me look as cool as I think they do?
2190520	2193520	And we're walking to the gate.
2193520	2198520	And we walk up to the guy, and I'm like, can we scan in?
2198520	2201520	And he was like, yeah, I'm holding Cody's boarding pass
2201520	2204520	so that she doesn't have to do anything.
2204520	2206520	She's holding my arm very quietly.
2206520	2208520	She knows exactly what she's doing, too, like a child.
2208520	2210520	She's like playing this game.
2210520	2211520	I get scanned in.
2211520	2216520	And as soon as we hit that bridge to the plane, she goes,
2216520	2217520	I killed it.
2217520	2223520	They didn't know.
2223520	2225520	They didn't know.
2225520	2226520	And they didn't know.
2226520	2229520	But then the first thing she does is she turns around and
2229520	2231520	bumps the guy in front of us, because they're still
2231520	2232520	lined aboard the flight.
2232520	2234520	And I was like, Cody, you can't.
2234520	2236520	Please don't do that.
2236520	2238520	I still can't get a hold of Jeff.
2238520	2239520	She bumps the guy again.
2239520	2241520	And he's like, what's wrong?
2241520	2243520	And then I leaned her up against that wall.
2243520	2244520	She sees the baby.
2244520	2245520	She does the thing.
2245520	2247520	Like, oh, look at this fucking baby.
2247520	2249520	And then she unzips her thing.
2249520	2250520	There was no buffer.
2250520	2252520	She didn't go, look at this fucking baby.
2252520	2254520	Hey, baby, admit it.
2254520	2257520	You wish I was your mom.
2257520	2262520	It was like about a three second between baby and me going,
2262520	2266520	whoa, and this action.
2266520	2268520	But then I walked around the flight.
2268520	2270520	And Dan was like, no, I don't.
2270520	2271520	I sit her down.
2271520	2273520	He's like, what the hell is happening?
2273520	2274520	Where's Jeff?
2274520	2276520	I sit in my seat.
2276520	2277520	I'm calling everybody.
2277520	2278520	I call Spencer.
2278520	2279520	I'm like, our flight's about to take off.
2279520	2284520	Please, can you call TSA and see if they have Jeff in a room
2284520	2286520	somewhere?
2286520	2289520	While he's doing that, I'm calling the LAX police going,
2289520	2291520	have you guys seen my friend Jeff Davis?
2291520	2292520	They haven't.
2292520	2294520	I go to the front of the plane.
2294520	2297520	I tell the woman, one of my party isn't here.
2297520	2299520	And she's like, well, who is it?
2299520	2300520	They look it up.
2300520	2301520	And they're like, he didn't check in.
2301520	2303520	And I was like, that's not possible.
2303520	2305520	I checked him in on the computer.
2305520	2307520	And I printed his boarding pass.
2307520	2310520	She's like, well, they already lifted his seat.
2310520	2311520	They already gave his seat away.
2311520	2315520	And I was like, OK, well, I don't know.
2315520	2317520	The LAX police didn't have him.
2317520	2319520	And we took off.
2319520	2321520	And you just said Hail Mary.
2321520	2323520	Jeff called me just as the plane was moving.
2323520	2326520	He was like, Levi.
2326520	2328520	Levi, where are you?
2328520	2329520	Where are you?
2329520	2330520	Play the message.
2330520	2332520	Can you play the message on the phone?
2332520	2333520	Yeah.
2333520	2335520	Yeah.
2335520	2336520	Oh, no.
2336520	2338520	It's not embarrassing.
2338520	2339520	Jeff doesn't like this.
2339520	2342520	So what's crazy is that you're like, think of everything
2342520	2343520	that we just told you.
2343520	2346520	And then this is Jeff's explanation.
2346520	2348520	I was like, Jeff, we're about to take off.
2348520	2349520	We're about to take off.
2349520	2350520	He's like, I can't hear you.
2350520	2351520	I can't hear you.
2351520	2352520	It's really loud out here.
2352520	2354520	And it's just honking horns in cars driving by.
2354520	2358520	So the last time you see someone is outside of Sbarro
2358520	2363520	in a Logan's run complex that is illegal to like cross
2363520	2364520	certain thresholds.
2364520	2366520	Everything is so official.
2366520	2369520	But you don't expect horns to be honking the next time
2369520	2370520	you hear from them.
2370520	2372520	Dan's texting me like, where is Jeff?
2372520	2374520	And I'm like, he's on the street somewhere.
2374520	2376520	There's a lot of honking in the background.
2376520	2377520	I was impressed.
2377520	2378520	He's the new Amelia Earhart.
2378520	2382520	I'm like, how did he get from a plane to a street?
2382520	2385520	And that's illegal.
2385520	2387520	So he calls me.
2387520	2388520	He keeps calling me.
2388520	2389520	He can't hear me.
2389520	2390520	He can't hear me.
2390520	2392520	I was like, text me.
2392520	2394520	And then he calls me one last time.
2394520	2395520	He goes, I can't hear you.
2395520	2397520	But I'm going to get on the next flight.
2397520	2398520	And then he called me again.
2398520	2401520	And he left me this message while I was mid-flight.
2401520	2402520	And we got it when I landed.
2402520	2403520	So let's see.
2403520	2404520	Hold on.
2404520	2405520	Oh, boy.
2405520	2406520	Hey, Steve.
2406520	2407520	It's Jeff.
2407520	2409520	I fucking slicked you out.
2409520	2419520	And I'm on flight 1420 from LAX to New York, JFK.
2419520	2421520	Oh, someone called Steve.
2421520	2422520	They fucked it up.
2422520	2423520	They fucked it up.
2423520	2424520	Sorry, everybody.
2424520	2426520	I mean, the point is, it's like Jeff goes, hey, sorry.
2426520	2427520	I flaked out.
2427520	2429520	1130 PM.
2429520	2434520	So let me know if I can get a car or otherwise I'll get my own car.
2434520	2435520	Sorry about that.
2435520	2436520	Thank you, Jim.
2436520	2441520	So he was fine.
2441520	2442520	And we were right.
2442520	2446520	So the question is, what's scarier?
2446520	2448520	The Cody version, where it's like, holy shit,
2448520	2449520	you had too much to drink.
2449520	2451520	You're King Kong.
2451520	2453520	The government has to be there.
2453520	2456520	But meanwhile, like a very frightening level of like,
2456520	2460520	he's like Denzel Washington in.
2460520	2465520	It's like, hey, is that after he got woke up by cops?
2465520	2466520	Yes.
2466520	2467520	And so he's just like, yeah.
2467520	2472520	So a little bit of a fucking spot of bother.
2472520	2475520	You know, nothing I can't handle, baby.
2475520	2478520	It's in the way that you do this.
2478520	2479520	I fell asleep.
2479520	2481520	I woke up on a fucking bench.
2481520	2483520	I was sleepy time Davis.
2483520	2486520	The one thing you can say was, I spaced out, I spaced out.
2486520	2489520	And all of us are going, what the fuck does that mean?
2489520	2491520	That's the best euphemism.
2491520	2495520	You know when you space out, we've all been there when you spaced out
2495520	2499520	and then wake up on the street corner, the cops poking you saying,
2499520	2503520	what city are you in?
2503520	2505520	It made me like rewind.
2505520	2509520	Well, since we met, like how many times you've said you spaced out to me.
2509520	2511520	You spaced out sometimes.
2511520	2512520	We all spaced out.
2512520	2514520	I fell asleep, Rob.
2514520	2515520	While walking somewhere.
2515520	2516520	I was sleeping.
2516520	2519520	No.
2519520	2523520	If I got, I went through security and I thought, you know what,
2523520	2525520	this seems like a bad flight to be on.
2525520	2526520	I don't like the vibe.
2526520	2529520	And I was like, I'm going to go out and sleep this one off.
2529520	2530520	Yeah.
2530520	2531520	There's going to be another flight in an hour.
2531520	2533520	It's all going to be good.
2533520	2539520	If you get sleepy while you're walking, you might be a space neck.
2539520	2541520	All right.
2541520	2542520	A space neck?
2542520	2547520	Fuck me for anticipating laugh volume.
2547520	2548520	I should know better than that.
2548520	2550520	Thank you for that valuable lesson.
2550520	2551520	Okay.
2551520	2553520	Now that we explained how we got here, let's start the show.
2553520	2555520	Okay.
2555520	2566520	From beautiful downtown New York, it's Homingtown.
2566520	2568520	Yeah.
2568520	2576520	Here's some things that Cody's doing when she's not offering a baby her breast on a random flight.
2576520	2579520	She's introducing me to this high maintenance show.
2579520	2582520	You guys like high maintenance or New Yorkers?
2582520	2583520	I love that show.
2583520	2585520	I just wanted to signal boost it.
2585520	2587520	You've seen this show, high maintenance?
2587520	2588520	No, I haven't.
2588520	2589520	What's it about?
2589520	2592520	It's like an anthology.
2592520	2598520	Like a lot of good shit, the pitch doesn't go as, oh, what a clever idea.
2598520	2599520	It's an anthology.
2599520	2601520	It's like a drug dealer in New York.
2601520	2608520	And like all of his, it kind of like weaves through the lives of his customers and stuff.
2608520	2609520	And then his life as well.
2609520	2611520	But it's just really like, it's such a good show.
2612520	2613520	Does he sell different drugs?
2613520	2614520	I thought it was just weed.
2614520	2615520	Yeah, it's weed.
2615520	2616520	Oh, okay.
2616520	2617520	Yeah.
2617520	2618520	I never watched it.
2618520	2622520	I mean, I didn't see every episode, there might be stories about how maybe he can hook
2622520	2623520	you up with Molly.
2623520	2624520	I don't know.
2624520	2625520	Hell yeah.
2625520	2626520	Next season.
2626520	2627520	It's just really exciting.
2627520	2632520	Do you think we can talk to somebody here at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center about
2632520	2637520	buying this desk so we can bring us back to LA so Spencer can always be at that thing?
2637520	2639520	I like it.
2640520	2643520	Here's a question that was asked in my hotel room, but I think it's been asked in the
2643520	2644520	podcast before.
2644520	2649520	It must have been Cody that asked it, does Spencer's dick have a beard?
2649520	2651520	That sounds fake and made up.
2651520	2652520	That really happened?
2652520	2656520	That was a real question, but I don't think she expected the answer to the yes.
2656520	2657520	That's good.
2657520	2658520	Yeah.
2658520	2660520	I think we're all dicks kind of have beards.
2660520	2664520	We were doing a call back to the fact that we ended up in a conversation.
2664520	2666520	Oh, shit.
2670520	2672520	She's already hell or anybody.
2672520	2673520	No!
2673520	2675520	No!
2675520	2676520	No!
2676520	2678520	We got places to go after the show.
2678520	2680520	You got the vodka back.
2680520	2681520	No.
2681520	2682520	No.
2682520	2683520	No.
2683520	2684520	Go to sleep.
2684520	2685520	Go to sleep.
2685520	2687520	Do you feel okay about the coverage?
2687520	2688520	Go to sleep.
2688520	2692520	Wait, didn't somebody, Dan, what was the person next to you that said, like, asked you at
2692520	2696520	the end of the flight about having to sit next to her, right?
2696520	2697520	Yeah.
2697520	2700520	You know, Cody, Cody bolted up out of the seat as we were landing, you know, and at
2700520	2702520	that point when everyone's got to get up to, you know, stand up.
2702520	2707520	And Cody was immediately befriending the flight attendants and talking to them.
2707520	2710520	And you could kind of just hear her voice wafting back through the plane.
2710520	2711520	A little bit.
2711520	2716520	And it was at that point that another guy in first class looked at me and in a kind
2716520	2721520	of, like, male bonding, like, or fellow traveler kind of thing, was like, you had to deal with
2721520	2723520	that the whole flight.
2724520	2730520	But because he didn't, I sent me dealing, because what he saw was me getting on a plane
2730520	2737520	and unloading my fucking No Man's Sky laptop and my Xbox controller and like, and then
2737520	2743520	he saw everyone's aunt get on the plane and plopped out and be like, what's going on?
2743520	2749520	And he probably never saw or heard any indication that we actually knew each other.
2750520	2754520	So he thought it was like I was in a plane's trains and automobiles sitch.
2754520	2757520	But then he was like, I nailed it.
2757520	2759520	I think I nailed the whole thing.
2759520	2762520	Like, I stand by what I said in that fucking bridge.
2762520	2764520	I fucking killed it.
2764520	2767520	Like, people, people were digging my vibe.
2767520	2768520	Like, I was, it was fun.
2768520	2770520	It was energetic.
2770520	2771520	No.
2771520	2773520	I don't remember.
2773520	2776520	You don't remember anyone not digging your vibe.
2776520	2777520	I don't.
2777520	2778520	That is true.
2778520	2784520	And I got to tell you, that's like, look, all's well that ends well.
2784520	2785520	Best sex we ever had.
2785520	2789520	Later when we checked into the hotel.
2789520	2790520	Thank you, Dan.
2790520	2791520	Thank you.
2791520	2792520	OK, but I did.
2792520	2793520	I actually came up here to clarify something else.
2793520	2795520	I don't really care about that story.
2795520	2798520	But yes, I did for real ask if your dick had a beard.
2798520	2799520	OK.
2799520	2801520	Well, do you want to know the context of it?
2801520	2805520	Well, do you because you obviously people have pubic hair.
2805520	2807520	I know, but I guess I was wondering if yours.
2807520	2808520	Yes, I know.
2808520	2809520	Obviously.
2809520	2812520	This was this while you were having sex with Dan.
2812520	2817520	No, this is like I said, best sex I ever had.
2817520	2818520	So that's a tip for you tonight.
2818520	2821520	Go home and talk about me.
2821520	2822520	Ask me.
2822520	2825520	Ask me more questions about Spencer's dick.
2825520	2828520	It was because earlier I had a beard.
2828520	2829520	Do you think it has a beard?
2829520	2831520	It was because I don't know.
2831520	2832520	I don't know.
2832520	2834520	Oh, it was because earlier.
2834520	2838520	I asked if your dick floats in the bathtub.
2838520	2839520	Oh, yeah, I remember that.
2839520	2843520	If it floats up like I wanted to know and Dan said.
2843520	2845520	I don't know if the time frame lines up here.
2845520	2847520	Dan said must be nice because.
2847520	2849520	Yeah, everybody's always look.
2849520	2851520	I wasn't saying that yours wouldn't float.
2851520	2852520	Right.
2852520	2855520	Do you think do you think do you think I have a micro penis?
2855520	2856520	No.
2856520	2859520	You have a perfectly sized penis for you.
2859520	2861520	You're a human.
2861520	2862520	Small.
2862520	2863520	Pair of players.
2863520	2865520	You know, you get you get it.
2865520	2867520	You get a badge when we have that conversation.
2867520	2869520	And I get to be a toothpick.
2869520	2872520	I still want to know like I'm nailing it.
2872520	2873520	I guess it doesn't.
2873520	2874520	It doesn't matter.
2874520	2877520	We found each other and we did fits.
2877520	2878520	I love it.
2878520	2879520	I love it.
2879520	2880520	You know how much I love it.
2880520	2881520	It shouldn't matter.
2881520	2882520	On the way here.
2882520	2883520	You took a shower.
2883520	2887520	And while you were in the shower, I was saying, you know, watch that dick dick extra good
2887520	2889520	because I'm going to suck on it later.
2889520	2892520	And then I and I and I heated that call.
2892520	2894520	I was working on it for like 20 minutes.
2894520	2895520	I conditioned it.
2895520	2896520	I'm ready.
2896520	2897520	Well first he refused the call.
2897520	2898520	I'm looking forward to it.
2898520	2901520	This is usually a point of anxiety with previous lovers.
2901520	2904520	I'm looking forward to sex.
2904520	2906520	So, I mean to you baby.
2906520	2907520	Me too.
2907520	2908520	What?
2908520	2909520	Me too.
2909520	2911520	My puke is going to throw up right now.
2911520	2916520	But Spencer said that his dick does float in the water.
2916520	2918520	So then I was imagining a dick.
2918520	2920520	Does everybody's dick float in the bathtub?
2920520	2921520	But not in a sexual way.
2921520	2923520	Dick does or doesn't float.
2923520	2924520	Yes.
2924520	2925520	Yes float.
2925520	2926520	Yes.
2926520	2927520	No float.
2927520	2928520	No.
2928520	2929520	No float.
2929520	2930520	Okay.
2930520	2931520	That's what I thought.
2931520	2932520	Okay.
2932520	2934520	All the ladies out there with pendulous breasts, which is a clinical term for the kind of breasts
2934520	2937520	that like, you know, you can put a pencil under.
2937520	2939520	Like some women don't have those kind of breasts.
2939520	2941520	They have just like little breasts, you know.
2941520	2946520	I have the kind of pendulous breasts that in the water they get extra buoyant and they
2946520	2947520	float.
2947520	2949520	So I was wondering if men have the same kind of experience.
2949520	2950520	And they do.
2950520	2952520	Well, yours does.
2952520	2953520	I think yours does.
2953520	2961520	But when your dick is basically a nipple, you can send me to Mars.
2961520	2963520	Let's skydive with me.
2963520	2964520	What's your dick doing?
2964520	2966520	I just want to hear these conversations.
2966520	2969520	What's your dick look like in a botanical dome?
2969520	2971520	And I'm just like, this is more evidence.
2971520	2975520	The fact that this is a question for anyone means I have a really small dick because this
2975520	2977520	wouldn't be a question if everyone's dick looked like mine.
2977520	2981520	You would never be like, does it float?
2981520	2982520	What do you mean?
2982520	2986520	It's a pepperoni and a fucking turtleneck.
2986520	2997520	It's an alien mandible that when in need, when it's agitated, when it's time to strike,
2997520	3002520	an impressive Rick Baker effect happens.
3002520	3009520	It's not so impressive that I then am in the realm of these people who apparently while
3009520	3010520	flaccid have a floaty dick.
3010520	3012520	It's not on top of the water.
3012520	3014520	It's just being upwardly mobile.
3014520	3015520	It's moving up.
3015520	3016520	It's trying to get there.
3016520	3022520	I picture your penis is so long that you're sitting in a bathtub and the head goes up
3022520	3024520	like a bobber when you're fishing.
3024520	3025520	Yeah.
3025520	3026520	No, it's not like that.
3026520	3030520	And it's just floating and then the rest of it is like a kite string.
3030520	3031520	No, no.
3031520	3033520	Rob, does your dick float?
3033520	3034520	Yeah.
3034520	3035520	Yeah.
3035520	3036520	I just assumed they all did.
3036520	3037520	I was there when you guys were talking about.
3037520	3038520	I know.
3038520	3039520	Everyone's got a great big dick.
3039520	3040520	Everyone's got a great big dick.
3040520	3042520	Oh, that's why I started thinking about it because you took a bath and I asked if your
3042520	3043520	dick floated first.
3043520	3045520	You said, you said, did you use bubble baths?
3045520	3046520	And I said, no.
3046520	3049520	He said, so you just looked at your dick and I go, why do you think I took a bath?
3049520	3052520	I got to look at that.
3052520	3053520	Yeah, I remember.
3053520	3054520	Okay.
3054520	3055520	Well, so.
3055520	3057520	I could have been on that fucking list.
3057520	3059520	I could have been at home.
3060520	3065520	I had a really profound therapy session before I came to New York because I've had a rough
3065520	3066520	year.
3066520	3069520	And rough year for me means nothing.
3069520	3077520	But my therapist is privy to the little labyrinthine thing I've been going through and all this
3077520	3078520	stuff.
3078520	3080520	And we really talked about it.
3080520	3085520	And this all does relate because I kind of like she was asked, she's like, all right.
3085520	3091520	So all this shit's over with all this stuff that you were thinking, what are you doing
3091520	3092520	this weekend?
3092520	3093520	I'm like, I'm going to New York.
3093520	3094520	I'm doing the show.
3094520	3095520	She's got all these questions.
3095520	3096520	I was like, are you going to New York?
3096520	3098520	What are you worried about going to when you do a show in New York?
3098520	3101520	What are you worried about being in public or whatever?
3101520	3103520	And I'm like, what are these questions?
3103520	3104520	I don't even understand.
3104520	3105520	Like, what is your perception of me?
3105520	3106520	It goes to this guy.
3106520	3109520	I go, look, here's how I feel about this stuff right now.
3109520	3117040	I feel like for a year, I have not been able to do what I've done all my life again, which
3117040	3125160	I said on my last episode, which is just talk and stay feeling safe because of the venting
3125160	3129520	of the shame and letting people know where I'm at and all this stuff.
3129520	3138480	And I started to get it was like I came through that session because she made me understand
3138480	3149960	that she's like, so you've been selling for 44 years this product called I don't care.
3149960	3153120	And that's been very comfortable for you.
3153120	3160200	And what you're really upset about right now is that you care and you resent people for
3160200	3165320	making you feel that way and you resent the ramifications of that and all this stuff.
3165320	3169360	And hearing her kind of like, parse it in this way.
3169360	3171220	What I came around to was, oh, shit.
3171220	3176760	So my job is not whether or not I should keep doing this or not doing it or whatever.
3176760	3182520	It's like, vulnerability is a good thing.
3182520	3185720	It's a thing that I've been allergic to.
3185720	3190560	Whenever I was on a playground and I would get beat up by the bully, sometimes I'd fight
3190560	3198640	back, sometimes I'd take the punches so hard that the bully would start to freak out.
3198640	3202240	Sometimes I'd just cry and piss my pants.
3202240	3207800	Like in any of those cases, the only thing that actually fucked me up was when the well-intended
3207800	3210280	person would come up behind me and go, hey, what are you doing?
3210280	3212680	Why are you doing that to this guy?
3212680	3217360	And then the bully would go, because he's dirty and his hair's nappy and he smells like
3217360	3219680	a fish.
3219680	3223120	And then that's not what would, I already knew that's why I was getting the beating.
3223120	3231040	I was like, I cosigned on that, yeah, I'm definitely not showering for this kind of person.
3231040	3237040	So let the beatings begin and whoa, Beaty, he who says enough.
3237040	3241440	I think that was kind of from Macbeth.
3241440	3246360	The thing that would make me cry is when that nice person would come up behind and then
3246360	3250080	say to that bully, go, so what if he doesn't comb his hair?
3250080	3252120	So what if he smells like a fish?
3252120	3254200	That doesn't make him a bad person.
3254200	3255200	You're a mean person.
3255200	3256720	You're the one beating people up.
3256720	3260400	You shouldn't beat people up just because they smell like fish.
3260400	3265640	That would make me want to murder the guy sticking up for me.
3265640	3269080	And it would make me more importantly, like want to get out of there who would make me
3269080	3271160	really, really sad.
3271160	3274880	It was the thing that hurt about getting beaten up.
3274880	3276360	Not the beating.
3276360	3279360	I fetishized getting beaten.
3279360	3280840	I fetishized the numbness.
3280840	3283840	I fetishized the abuse.
3283840	3289880	Just don't ever, ever fucking try to convince me that I'm vulnerable.
3289880	3293160	Because vulnerability means destruction.
3293160	3295000	But no, it doesn't.
3295000	3298360	That's the thing that I recalibrated.
3298360	3304160	These relationships between shame, vulnerability, and existence, and what our job is, what bravery
3304160	3310520	is, and all this stuff, I finally came out of that going, okay, so vulnerability is good.
3310520	3315000	It's actually good to tell people, here's what I'm embarrassed about.
3315000	3317800	Here's what makes me feel bad.
3317800	3319760	Here's how you can actually hurt me.
3319760	3323360	Here's the amount of pain that I'm feeling.
3323360	3327600	That's a good thing to share that stuff.
3327600	3334080	It's a bad thing to let trauma push you back and cause you to start getting more and more
3334080	3335920	practical.
3335920	3340080	That's called PTSD.
3340080	3344640	You experience a random piece of chaos that makes you wonder what the fuck you've been
3344640	3350360	your whole life, and then your solution is to limit your experience to a little straw
3350360	3355200	so that the distance between the cup and your mouth doesn't have as much of an opportunity
3355200	3358200	to be fucking violated again.
3358200	3360040	That's chaos winning.
3360040	3363200	That's cycle of abuse.
3363200	3365160	That's the problem.
3365160	3370480	It's natural and it's good, but I finally figured it out.
3370480	3374000	For this last year, I've been like, what am I doing on this show?
3374000	3378600	What am I supposed to be doing?
3378600	3387680	If there's things that talking about them actually helps Nazis, so then the way you
3387680	3392880	fight Nazis is you pretend they're not Nazis, and all this shit, just like the spiral of
3392880	3398160	thought and all this shit with this fucking mentally ill people weaponized by 4chan trolls
3398160	3403200	and people doing their best to try to get me fired and all this shit, all of the experiences
3403200	3409000	that I've gone through this last year, the common theme has been, well, I know one thing's
3409000	3410000	for sure.
3410000	3414440	The worst thing you could ever do is go out there and talk about it.
3414440	3415560	It's been true.
3415560	3417640	That's a true thing.
3417640	3422200	It completely fucked me up, but now I got it.
3422200	3424000	I think I got it.
3424000	3430960	I'm sharing this now because I'm pretty sure Jeff is probably pretty embarrassed that he's
3430960	3439640	such a 70s family feud drunkard that he can fall asleep on his feet and end up in the
3439640	3450200	clutches of the police outside LAX, but I want you supported in that vulnerability.
3450200	3454480	I don't want you punished for it.
3454480	3458720	If I were to enter your head, I'd be like, well, don't talk too frankly about this stuff
3458720	3462440	because then when it comes down to whether or not you're this or that and whether you
3462440	3465920	should quit doing this or quit doing that, then everyone else has all the power because
3465920	3468480	they're all weighing in on your life and all that shit.
3468480	3470240	But no, that's not true.
3470240	3477880	We can continue to be pathologically unapologetic, self exploratory, narcissistic fucking sociopathic
3477880	3479880	messes.
3479880	3486120	We have to double down now more than ever about what we find in our navel every morning.
3486120	3488920	If you're gay right now, can I ask a favor of you?
3488920	3495640	Could you please be more gay in everything that you say and everything that you do?
3495640	3501680	If you're a person of color and then you happen to have a distaste for identity politics,
3501680	3505740	could you find a little bit of a love for it, just to antagonize the kinds of people
3505740	3513160	that want to ... So that we can draw battle lines between those who want shame to grow
3513160	3521320	on trees and those who want to overcome it because that battle will be won by the people
3521320	3523960	who oppose shame.
3523960	3527320	But this battle that we're fighting right now, where it's like, who should be more
3527320	3528320	ashamed?
3528320	3533760	Well, guess who's going to win, shame mongers, shame experts.
3533760	3538160	Yeah, but I'm right to feel ashamed about my behavior today or last night.
3538160	3541760	Jeff, how dare you imply that I read you wrong.
3541760	3542760	Fuck you.
3542760	3548560	No, I wasn't sure if I wanted to discuss this tonight because it is embarrassing, but it
3548560	3553720	happened and talking about it out loud makes me want to improve myself and not do that
3553720	3555040	again.
3555040	3559240	That's really, really fucking bad.
3559240	3560240	It's really shady.
3560240	3564560	It's so weird because I honestly, hearing the story, I was standing back there hearing
3564560	3567680	it about me and I was like, fucking sounds so cool.
3567680	3574520	I'm fucking a fan of my ... I didn't even know I could stay and do such cool shit.
3574520	3582240	I was wearing this fucking jumpsuit that I remember peeing and a sleeve might have brushed
3582240	3587920	the top of the water because for the jumpsuit, you have to take off the whole thing and sit
3587920	3590840	down and you're naked on top when you pee.
3590840	3596480	I definitely remember being like, remember not to let the sleeve go in the water and
3596480	3602120	then I don't remember anything else after that.
3602120	3608840	Anyway, but honestly, I thought it was a win for most of us.
3608840	3610040	Oh yeah, no, we did it.
3610040	3613760	Steve Levy, I give you so ... I mean, you know I love you, man.
3613760	3617400	I don't remember anything, but I do remember ...
3617400	3620120	Leave the MVP all the way.
3620120	3623040	Shrav, you're a real piece of shit though.
3623040	3624120	I didn't do anything.
3624120	3626200	I just was like, oh God.
3626200	3628680	All right, let's see what else we do.
3628680	3630280	I guess I'm ashamed of that.
3630280	3631280	I didn't help out.
3631280	3633080	What is this little red pouch that you're holding, Shrav?
3633080	3636000	You've been holding a strange kind of leather-ed pouchy thing.
3636000	3639520	Is my ... Excuse me?
3639520	3643000	Oh, your glasses.
3643000	3646120	I put my glasses in it.
3646120	3655840	Oh, have I ever told you guys that I've known Rob Shrav for 70 years, whatever it is?
3655840	3656840	72.
3656840	3658840	72 on Monday.
3658840	3667320	He still maintains, he's never bothered to let this go, that he ... One of the many neurotypical
3667320	3679280	things that he hates, like Pictionary, big words he hates, he absolutely hates the Happy
3679280	3683880	Birthday song, and the crazy thing is it's about to be his birthday.
3683880	3690200	And since we're here at the Metropolitan Opera House, I thought we should make Rob
3690200	3693320	kill himself by singing him Happy Birthday.
3693320	3698320	Happy Birthday to you.
3698320	3703400	Happy Birthday to you.
3703400	3709880	Happy Birthday, dear Rob Shrav.
3710880	3715880	Happy Birthday to you.
3715880	3716880	Wait.
3716880	3721880	Do we have to pay $25,000 for that?
3721880	3724880	Dan, do you want to sing in the company?
3724880	3725880	No, it's legal now.
3725880	3726880	It's fine.
3726880	3727880	I think it's legal now.
3727880	3730880	I think they kicked those sisters that own the rights for the Happy Birthday song.
3730880	3731880	Get on the floor!
3731880	3732880	Get on the floor!
3732880	3736560	You guys know about the TV thing with Happy Birthday, that it used to cost a lot of money,
3736560	3740160	so that's why on a lot of TV shows, when they sing the Happy Birthday song, it's like
3740160	3742960	a fake, it's like, Happy Birthday.
3742960	3743960	Happy Happy Birthday.
3743960	3748560	Dan, do you want to sing Rob the ... Or as a community, when we fade in, and it's
3748560	3756520	Troy's birthday, and they go, to you, and then on top of it, and then a character goes,
3756520	3761400	like, I don't understand that song, what do you mean, to you?
3761400	3767040	Because I'm a genius.
3767040	3768040	It was great.
3768040	3771040	It was a great episode.
3771040	3774040	The crazy thing is that the Happy Birthday song, now it's Kleenex.
3774040	3779680	Now anyone can just fucking cum in it, whatever you want.
3779680	3788040	But Mickey Mouse turns 175, and it's, you know, it's time to re-examine America's copyright
3788040	3789040	laws.
3789040	3790880	I thought that was amazing.
3791320	3794400	I remember when that happened, it was like, Mickey Mouse is about to become as old as
3794400	3798800	Mark Twain novels.
3798800	3804320	You're about to be able to do whatever the fuck you want to Mickey Mouse, and the entire
3804320	3811920	establishment was like, well, obviously we're going to have ... That's not right.
3811920	3815880	And everyone reacted like, yeah, well, what are you going to be able to just use Mickey
3815880	3816880	Mouse?
3816880	3817880	That's not fair.
3817880	3819640	We all just rolled with it.
3819640	3821800	Well, how would you protest that?
3821800	3822920	What kind of group would that be?
3822920	3831520	What kind of antifa would be out front of a building going like, hey, hey, ho, ho, not
3831520	3838400	letting me draw Mickey Mouse, blowing the little mermaid has got to go.
3838400	3842120	And selling it as a t-shirt at Spencer's Gifts, not you.
3842120	3843120	All right.
3843120	3844120	Sorry.
3844120	3845120	I've been drinking.
3845120	3846120	That could be something.
3846120	3848120	All right.
3848120	3849560	Spencer's beard probably doesn't have a dick.
3849560	3850560	Oh, yeah.
3850560	3851560	Back to that.
3851560	3853560	What do you mean?
3853560	3857120	What's the beard part in your mind, in your conception?
3857120	3861360	That you would grow out your pubes, like ... I don't know, that you would grow them out
3861360	3864280	in a way that ... Do the curtains match the drapes, you know?
3864280	3867680	Well, I do shave the front three quarters of each ball.
3867680	3869280	Wait, the curtains match the drapes there.
3869280	3870480	Wait, wait, what do you do?
3870480	3874200	I shave the three quarters of each ball.
3874200	3875200	Each ball?
3875200	3876720	That sounds like you have more than two.
3876720	3877720	Right.
3877720	3880600	That gives each of them a little beard.
3880600	3885320	We got ... I think like ... Well, only so ... Here's what I heard.
3885320	3888760	I'm not on Twitter anymore, so my news comes through weird trickles.
3888760	3892400	I literally talk to people that are water cooler now.
3892400	3900360	The Girl Scouts are suing the Boy Scouts because the Boy Scouts are dropping the boy part,
3900360	3901760	and therefore becoming scouts.
3901760	3903320	Oh, shit.
3903320	3907560	And so the Girl Scouts are like, fuck you.
3907560	3914400	You can't fucking horn in on our ... You can't transition and then just invite yourself
3914400	3920280	to our slumber party and start talking about how dudes are full of shit.
3920280	3924200	The Girl Scouts are ... That's what I heard.
3924200	3926440	Isn't the Church of Satan suing Netflix?
3926440	3927440	Yeah.
3927440	3928440	For what reason?
3928440	3930640	They use the image of Bofo Man.
3930640	3932360	Who's Bofo Man?
3932360	3933360	The ...
3933360	3934360	Church of Satan.
3934360	3938440	And according to ... They have a Bofo Man.
3938440	3941400	Bofo Man is a person or a building?
3941400	3943200	It's a depiction of Satan.
3943200	3945160	It's a depiction of Satan that's copy written.
3945160	3946160	Or a demon.
3946160	3947160	What?
3947160	3948160	Yeah.
3948160	3949160	It's copy written.
3949160	3950160	I mean, a legend.
3950160	3951160	Are you a Satanist or were you ever ... No, no.
3951160	3952160	I think it's all very, very stupid.
3952160	3953160	Bofo Man is a copy.
3953160	3955520	And anyone who thinks it's at all cool is stupid.
3955520	3957840	Well, I would ... Sorry, everybody.
3957840	3962280	Okay, so ... Okay, next ... Next ... Here's my final tidbit that I learned at a party
3962280	3964920	from our Swedish friend.
3964920	3971760	The Swedish ... So picture a Swede.
3971760	3974840	Are you picturing a diversity hire?
3974840	3979160	I just want to seed that.
3979160	3987280	Because I was amazed to find out from our Swedish friend that in Sweden there are ... Now,
3987280	3990120	I'm going to get a bunch ... I'm going to butcher some of this and some of you in a crowd
3990120	3992640	that's bigger are going to be like, no, I know what you're talking about and I actually
3992640	3993640	know what I'm talking about.
3993640	4005480	Try not to get too agitated by my thing, but I ... The Swedes are not OG Swedes.
4005480	4011680	They also ... They moved into Sweden and there were people there that were already Swedish
4011680	4019360	who got marginalized and are hanging out and they still live there and it's nothing ... Any
4019360	4027600	parallel ... They're called the Sami ... I don't know how to pronounce it, but they look
4027600	4037100	like old navy Christmas elves from ... They dress very festively and midwesterny.
4037100	4042200	They raise reindeer and they live in tents and they ... I can't ... Would you pull up
4042200	4043640	a picture of them?
4043640	4048520	They also look like Abba, but I guess their jaws are different or something?
4049520	4056160	It was 2,000 years ago that the Swedes showed up in Sweden and then these people then got
4056160	4057160	pushed aside.
4057160	4063480	I'm like, you haven't fucked that problem out yet?
4063480	4069560	How much races can you have when both people are white and it takes you 2,000 years to
4069560	4072560	not fuck each other?
4072560	4076960	It made me feel good about America because I'm like, we haven't ... We just fucking jumped
4076960	4079920	into the fucking dirt and we're like, what are you doing here?
4079920	4080920	I don't know.
4080920	4081920	I'm looking for gold.
4081920	4082920	I'm racist.
4082920	4083920	Well, I'm fucking black.
4083920	4084920	Fuck you.
4084920	4090320	I'm ... And we just fucking ... People banging gavels and going, look, we need a fucking railroad,
4090320	4095040	so I'm telling you, these people are free, but not you chicks.
4095040	4096040	Everyone gets a gun.
4096040	4099160	No, only if it's a revolver.
4099160	4101160	Two hundred years we've been doing this.
4101160	4102160	It's like nothing.
4102160	4103160	It's a blink of an eye.
4103160	4107720	The country this young should have fallen apart with this degree of everybody just like
4107720	4111160	chesting up on each other when they're allowed to.
4111160	4117080	When you talk to your European friends and their dirty little secrets come out, I'm like,
4117080	4125440	you guys, like 2,000 years ago, you haven't fucked these people yet?
4125440	4126440	That's my ... I don't know.
4126440	4127440	I just found it uplifting.
4127440	4132880	They live in the ... They're kind of like ... In order for Americans to understand it,
4132880	4137680	you have to fuse your understanding ... Everyone tonight, I want you to ... If you take one
4137680	4142920	message away from our show tonight, I want you to go home and fuck a Sammy tonight.
4142920	4145120	Fuck any ... Fuck everybody.
4145120	4146120	Everybody fuck everybody.
4146120	4147120	Hurry up.
4147120	4149640	That's what I'm saying.
4149640	4155400	The two minute clock is ... I mean, obviously, consensually.
4155400	4160280	That's my point, is everybody fuck everybody, not half of you fuck people and half of you
4160280	4167960	say no thank you and that's ... Let's stop doing that too.
4167960	4170360	Let's all just ... I heard Bill Cosby fell down the stairs
4170360	4171360	in jail.
4171360	4172360	Did you hear this?
4172360	4177920	It's like, first date, date line, Los Angeles.
4177920	4181480	Bill Cosby, first day of prison, falls down the stairs.
4181480	4186880	So he's like ... Oh shit.
4186880	4188880	Love dropping a mic, huh?
4189400	4192160	Don't do that.
4192160	4193320	People keep throwing sandwiches at him too?
4193320	4198240	Yeah, he got hit in the head with a stale hot dog bun on early the first week.
4198240	4199240	People keep food fighting them too.
4199240	4204520	I have to imagine ... When you hear that, don't you think, oh, must be nice to be so
4204520	4209760	famous that basically you have a ... He got a bun thrown at him?
4209760	4217760	I'm like, the day after I'm in prison, I'm going to have whatever tattoo the strongest
4217760	4220920	dude told me to get.
4220920	4226360	I will have shanked anyone smaller than me that was ... I was told to shank.
4226360	4230000	I will have been ... It's like, did you ever watch that I Love
4230000	4236840	You Phillip Morris story, that movie where Jim Carrey is the new guys on ... It just
4236840	4242240	got to prison and he goes, well, if they start beating you up, always fight back or you could
4242240	4247120	suck their dick, like that, you could either wash their clothes for them or you could suck
4247120	4248120	your dick.
4248120	4249120	Suck their dick.
4249120	4253760	The answer is, suck their dick, suck their dick, and the last thing, and you can suck
4253760	4254760	my dick now.
4254760	4255760	That's not real.
4255760	4256760	So, what is that right?
4256760	4257760	That's not real.
4257760	4259760	There's a lot of homophobia in prison.
4259760	4260760	Okay.
4260760	4261760	That's true.
4261760	4263680	I was talking about the movie.
4263680	4267920	This character, Jim Carrey's character is talking to another guy and saying, these are
4267920	4268920	these options.
4268920	4269920	Right.
4269920	4275760	Shout out to our imprisoned podcast listeners, which I don't know if podcasting is a thing
4275760	4276760	in prison.
4276760	4279080	This is a hot dog bun at Bill Cosby.
4279080	4281560	Let's see if we can now do it next week.
4281560	4285240	I do want to let you know I have a pet peeve about this.
4285240	4289480	I don't like that our society thinks it's totally fucking kosher, this idea that there's
4289480	4294680	like a, oh, you go to prison, which is supposed to be a bad place, and I'm not being a prudent
4294680	4296160	saying, let's stop making jokes about it.
4296160	4300480	I think it's fucked up that we all have this understanding that, oh, and then when you
4300480	4306600	get in there, it's fucking horrible, in ways that make no sense and that weren't ordered
4306600	4311320	by a judge, you could get raped and you could get murdered and it all depends on whether
4311320	4312440	or not you just...
4312440	4316320	And we all just go, yeah, that's what prison is like, because it should be a bad place.
4316320	4318160	Come on, these people fucking...
4318160	4325240	These are the only people you caught and that showed up to court and were made themselves
4325240	4327120	available to handcuffs.
4327120	4331280	Make a fucking life for them in the joint.
4331280	4332640	It's probably...
4332640	4338600	This Alaska Airlines flight made me want to go legit.
4338600	4341240	No leg room for five hours.
4341240	4344600	I was on my back, my feet are on the ceiling.
4344600	4348760	I am pretty sure prison's always going to be a drag.
4348760	4353600	Let's stop accepting that it's escape from New York and that, oh, where you're going,
4353600	4356040	I heard Bubba's going to fuck your butt.
4356040	4357840	That's so fucked up.
4357840	4359760	I'm not saying the jokes aren't...
4359760	4360760	Don't make jokes about that.
4361720	4366240	Are you saying we should make prison better or stop joking that it's bad?
4366240	4367240	We should...
4367240	4368360	No, jokes, jokes, smokes.
4368360	4370720	I'm saying we should...
4370720	4376120	If we're going to have the largest prison population in the world, we should start looking
4376120	4382280	at prison the way we look at other shit where we're like, well, here's...
4382280	4385200	Tell them America sent you...
4385200	4390560	The prison system is basically a huge, gigantic fucking part of the American experience.
4390560	4395880	Let's define ourselves by how rehabilitative it is and how much it prepares you to be the
4395880	4399840	next Elon Musk.
4399840	4405040	Show people, show the world and go like, just dude, grand larceny, didn't have a chance.
4405040	4406040	Every fucking...
4406040	4407040	By the time you get out...
4407040	4408040	Just neighborhood sign off on him.
4408040	4412920	We're going to reform you into a rich douchebag.
4412920	4416960	Got out of the joint, invested in Tesla, and fucking started his own playwright.
4416960	4421400	Is Elon Musk becoming the least likable person?
4421400	4424400	Every time you read a news story about this guy, he's just becoming a bigger twat.
4424400	4426600	And there's Nazis, Jeff.
4426600	4427600	There's Nazis.
4427600	4428600	Oh, right.
4428600	4433040	I just get scared because I truly do say I believe it's possible for me to go to prison.
4433040	4438760	It was fucking acting badass about searching my laptop to some TSA guy.
4438760	4443240	If you're at the wrong place at the wrong time, you end up in prison.
4443240	4446840	People are going to say, well, Dan Harmon's in prison, and then they're going to go, well,
4446840	4449640	then, you know, he's probably going to get raped.
4449640	4454800	Imagine how that feels when you're behind the door, like, what do you mean, probably
4454800	4455800	going to get...
4455800	4459280	That's not on the menu.
4459280	4461360	That should be a thing I sign up for.
4461360	4463960	All right, well, okay.
4463960	4466520	Preach into the choir or I don't know.
4466520	4468880	You definitely shouldn't sign up for prison, though.
4468880	4469880	That's true.
4470880	4475560	I think this theater, there's a prison being built across the street, and all of these
4475560	4482200	guys live in the attic, and they're like, come on, fair's fair, we don't want this prison.
4482200	4483200	It's all local politics.
4483200	4484200	That's why they're not...
4484200	4488000	There's all this crazy shit with prisons because they're all owned by companies and shit.
4488000	4493000	We should open a fucking prison and make it the best fucking prison that people, like,
4493000	4497800	I'll tell you a little tidbit, I got in trouble.
4497800	4498800	Let's open a Herman jail.
4499320	4506520	We could just put bars on the rest of society and call ourselves prisoners of...
4506520	4507840	We could say we're locked away.
4507840	4508840	I like this, yeah.
4508840	4509840	Yeah.
4509840	4515160	I'm sure everybody's in the mood to follow me on some gimmick for the podcast because
4515160	4517160	they really got that moon payoff.
4517160	4518160	What's your tidbit?
4518160	4519760	You said you had a tidbit.
4519760	4525840	I was saying, I think I could start a cool prison because when I was a kid, I got caught
4525840	4529840	smoking a cigarette in the parking lot at school, in high school.
4529840	4534680	I was with three other girls, the vice principal walked down, made eye contact with me, saw
4534680	4539120	that I clearly was smoking, but I had enough time to warn my friends, so they put their
4539120	4541680	cigarettes out, and I took the fall for all of them.
4541680	4547040	The principal, she fucking knew, in the office, she was like, look, I have to call your parents.
4547040	4549560	It is a big thing, but I want to give you props.
4549560	4551760	I saw what you did back there, cool on you.
4551760	4554240	There was an unspoken thing, at least I think.
4554240	4556400	We like organized crime.
4556400	4563200	What happened was, since she felt sympathetic toward me, she was like, listen, I'm not going
4563200	4564200	to suspend you.
4564200	4568640	I'm going to make this limited thing where it's just lunchtime detention and all of you
4568640	4571440	guys are going to have to go because you guys weren't even allowed to be in the parking
4571440	4572440	lot.
4572440	4575040	It was like lunchtime detention in this room, right?
4575040	4577160	We had to go every day and eat lunch there.
4577160	4581040	By the end of the week, people were fucking getting in trouble on purpose to be part of
4581040	4582040	Lunch Bunch.
4582040	4587200	We were having our own page in our yearbook, it caught on, is what I'm saying.
4587200	4590120	And part of it was, at first, people were just coming to hang out with us, and then
4590120	4593760	it was like, no, you have to get into Lunch Bunch, you have to actually get in, you have
4593760	4598360	to get into trouble, because the teacher, Mr. Sherrod, was like, I'll lot it.
4598360	4601200	And so then they were getting in trouble.
4601200	4602200	What?
4602200	4603200	What?
4603200	4604200	Mr. Sherrod.
4604200	4605200	Oh, okay.
4605200	4606200	That's what I'm talking about.
4606200	4607200	Sorry, Mr. Sherrod.
4607200	4608200	How old do you think I am?
4608200	4609200	I have a question.
4609880	4610880	I'm the teacher.
4610880	4617440	Lunch Bunch sounds like an awesome sequel to Breakfast Club.
4617440	4620280	And there's dinner centers, I mean, you have the whole...
4620280	4627280	It is a good, but I mean, really, it gets right to that point, which is that society is supposed
4627280	4628280	to...
4628280	4631680	Well, at least the liberal side of society says you're supposed to be defined by the
4631680	4635600	treatment, the experience you have as the lowest person, right?
4635600	4644320	So if someone were to propose prison reform and say like, oh, when you go to prison, actually
4644320	4647200	you get kind of a fucking break.
4647200	4650200	Like this nightmare for people who are like, fuck them.
4650200	4654600	It's like, isn't there this really easy, thick line where it's like, well, then do you...
4654600	4659640	Sounds like you want to go to prison, which isn't the same with gay marriage and drugs
4659640	4663560	and all of a sudden, there's always this debate between people who are like, well, what?
4663560	4666560	Then everyone just starts smoking joints all the time?
4666560	4667560	What the fuck?
4667560	4671160	What's to stop me from smoking a joint?
4671160	4673960	And that's always the other person that I started doing, I was like, sounds like you
4673960	4677600	want to fucking smoke a joint.
4677600	4681720	Or you're worried that if you do, you're going to punch somebody, or that you're not going
4681720	4682720	to...
4682720	4683720	Or that you're going to die, or that you'll think.
4683720	4689280	And it's like, with prison reform, it's kind of like, what is our real worry that, oh,
4689280	4695880	if you grow up in a shitty neighborhood, and you end up sentenced of a crime, and then
4695880	4700760	you're like, oh, we're worried that the slippery slope is that everyone's going to want to
4700760	4701760	go to prison.
4701760	4706960	And I'm like, what if you pushed that gas pedal down, and we're like, yeah, make a society
4706960	4710040	where everyone wants to go to prison.
4710040	4711040	Figure it out.
4711040	4715440	Like, by the time you figure out how to create that society, I think you're going to have
4715440	4718360	accidentally created a proper...
4718360	4719360	Because itself.
4719360	4722040	Because you're going to be like, well, then why is it prison?
4722040	4723520	And then you're going to be like, yeah.
4723520	4726240	You come out of prison a better person, is what you're...
4726240	4727240	No, I don't...
4727240	4728440	You don't know what I'm talking about.
4728440	4729440	No.
4729440	4730440	You ruined everything.
4730440	4731440	I was being so clear.
4731440	4735720	They were silent because I was being clear.
4735720	4736920	You ruined it.
4736920	4742080	That's the way I choose to remember this, which I will not in 10 minutes.
4742080	4747280	I'm sorry, I ruined the show with my pontifications about society, but I feel like, in my head,
4747280	4752240	there's like a definition, like the podcast has to be like 70% how we got here, even though
4752240	4753240	we were drunk.
4753240	4757920	And then I choose to make 30% somehow educational or something.
4757920	4758920	It was good.
4758920	4762560	It's a throwback to my 80s education.
4762560	4767400	That was like a public access programming, was born of that.
4767400	4771840	They were like, well, we'll give you a monopoly over television, cable company, but you have
4771840	4774440	to let poor people use cameras.
4774440	4781600	It's a new segment on our show called The More You Drink.
4781600	4785480	Okay, so we're at the end of our festival.
4785480	4786480	We'll run away.
4786480	4788480	Have you guys been enjoying your festival?
4788480	4789480	Thank you.
4789480	4790480	I love that.
4790480	4791480	Disappointed.
4791480	4795640	Thank you so much for the New York Comedy Festival for having us out here.
4795640	4800440	All the voices that were sad about the show being over were feminine, I noticed.
4800440	4801440	Finally.
4801440	4802440	Yeah, I know.
4802440	4806760	Finally, we got some bitches on our side.
4806760	4809000	What are you, Cody?
4809000	4812720	It's because Cody is so bon vivant with her fucking beanie and her fucking like, I'll
4812720	4814720	show my titty to a baby and I'm going to shit.
4814720	4818440	You guys are good guys and women, we love you.
4818440	4819440	I'm one woman.
4819440	4820440	I love you.
4820440	4821440	I love all of you guys.
4821440	4822440	I love all you guys.
4822440	4825280	I think this has been a fun time for me.
4825280	4827440	This is my first time coming on the podcast.
4827440	4828440	Yeah.
4828440	4829440	Hell yeah.
4829440	4833720	I've been dating Dan for three years and this is the first time and the whole reason
4833720	4838240	I never come on is because there's really mean people on Reddit and they say really
4838240	4839680	mean things.
4839680	4844440	One guy, there was a whole thread about I put a lot of nude pictures up on my Instagram
4844440	4849040	and this guy is trying to talk shit and he's like, I don't even get why she would do that.
4849040	4852320	She's just a fleshy pyramid with a doughy face on top.
4852320	4853320	So guess what I did?
4853320	4855800	I fucking took back the night.
4855800	4860680	Now I take even more nude pictures and I fucking hashtag fleshy pyramid with doughy
4860680	4864240	face on top and now I'm loving it.
4864240	4865240	Embracing the shame.
4865240	4866240	Prison reform.
4866240	4867240	All right.
4867240	4872600	Maybe that guy is masturbating, but I don't know, but you're happier than I am and I'm
4872600	4877080	happier because I'm with you because you, when you look at me, when I get naked and
4877080	4883680	at the foot of the bed and go like, I'm a flamingo, I'm like, holy shit, I'm in a place
4883680	4885520	of no judgment and no shame.
4885520	4889520	It's like, and then it's like, you go like, oh, go like that and I'm going to Instagram
4889520	4890520	me.
4890520	4891520	I'm like, okay, whatever.
4891520	4892520	I am fine.
4892520	4893520	I'm going to get called fat.
4893520	4895120	Can I ask one question to codes?
4895120	4899840	So when, when Dan was in the bathroom and you were, you were like in the other room saying,
4899840	4902040	wash that dick because I'm going to suck it later.
4902040	4907720	Were you in the outfit with sunglasses and go, wash that dick so I can suck it?
4907720	4908720	And my mechanic jumps in.
4908720	4909720	Yeah.
4909720	4910720	Were you in there?
4910720	4911720	Yes.
4911720	4912720	Okay.
4912720	4913720	That's pretty fucking...
4913720	4914720	You know what, Dan?
4914920	4917560	You know, wash that dick because I'm going to suck it later.
4917560	4918560	Yeah, I know.
4918560	4919560	I know.
4919560	4922560	I for one, Dan, I for one, I'm glad that your dick doesn't float.
4922560	4925400	I think that's, I think that makes you special.
4925400	4926400	Hey, probably.
4926400	4937800	I, when I, if I think about, if I was going to perform oral pleasures on a gentleman,
4938800	4945760	I would like to start with a little, like a salted nut, like fucking, like a little,
4945760	4951040	a little thumb tip, like right above the knuckle and like have the pleasure of the fucking
4951040	4952040	fur.
4952040	4955480	Happy New Year.
4955480	4959520	It would make me feel more masculine and like, I like that.
4959520	4962440	It's like every, and so does every Cracker Jack prize.
4962440	4964040	Like, like, oh, it's a dinosaur.
4964040	4967760	You drop it in the water and you, I guess, I mean, we are, we have the fur.
4967760	4971000	It's a phrase grower and not a shower, but sorry, go ahead.
4971000	4973760	I was just saying, I love your dick a lot.
