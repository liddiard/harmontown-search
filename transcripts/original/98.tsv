0	21240	Welcome back everybody.
21240	45800	For those of you not here live in Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, I am dressed
45800	51600	as a pirate because I came from the Renaissance Fair with all of the Harmonians, or the Hormontown
51600	53600	cast more or less.
53600	63760	But without further ado, please welcome the main pirate, Charger Shit, Mr. Dan Harmon.
63760	64760	Thank you.
64760	65760	Thank you.
65760	66760	Welcome back.
66760	69760	I missed you too.
69760	72240	We all missed each other.
72240	73240	I missed you too.
73240	75240	Yeah, we took a month off.
75320	77320	It was good that we took a month off.
77320	80320	I didn't really miss you during that month.
80320	82320	I was exactly ready to come back.
82320	85320	Because we spent the entire month at a Renaissance Fair.
85320	89320	Yeah, we went to the, was it the Renaissance Fair?
89320	97840	Listen, honestly, it seems dumb to disclaim this, but I am so fucking drunk and high.
97840	104920	It seems stupid to even bother to say it, but I have to tell you, and that doesn't mean
104920	107000	that I'm giving myself an excuse.
107000	113600	That doesn't, I absolutely take it upon myself to give you your $10 worth.
113600	115960	Is it still $10?
115960	122320	You're not walking out of here feeling like you wasted $10.
122320	129640	That's the fucking Harmon guarantee, but I am so drunk and so high.
129640	134680	Because we went into a, we went, we got in a bus dressed as pirates, we got onto a field
134760	139120	and we went to a place, like we've been doing this every year for the last four years.
139120	140120	Four or five years, yeah.
140120	147200	It's a goddamn, the Renaissance Fair, you don't know what it really is.
147200	153160	It's a goddamn Mecca, it's more than Comic Con, it's a more important thing.
153160	160560	It's a Malcolm X level, like actual statement of fucking position.
160560	164160	You go through these turnstiles and then it's like, no, you're the, like there's guys that
164160	169920	are wearing baseball caps, they're like, you're the nerd now, you're the nerd.
169920	171680	Why don't you look weird?
171680	175760	You're the fucking nerd, and they're kind of like, they're having fun and they're like
175760	181440	pushing their strollers, like we like, we like the Renaissance a little bit, not enough.
181440	183760	You don't like it enough, where's your eyeshadow?
183760	188480	What's your, you just fucking bully them, you're the fucking nerd tonight.
188480	193320	And it just, nothing bad happens to anybody, but it's just like your blood pumps, that's
193320	194320	why I go.
194320	202320	I say, everybody's got a plastic sword, and you're like, you're the fucking nerd.
202320	205120	Is that what you get out of it?
205120	206120	I started going-
206120	208920	You just like to wear women's shoes.
208920	212720	You'll find that these slippers are Prada that were given to me by Greg Proust, they
212720	213720	were too big for him.
213720	218440	And I'm like, I'm never going to wear size 14 jazz slippers until the Renaissance Fair
218440	219440	came into my life.
220440	223440	Those are my own socks though.
223440	232920	Now, there's a section that, okay, sorry, everything I'm wearing right now, minus my
232920	239280	socks, everything I'm wearing right now is from the women's section at a Buffalo exchange
239280	241720	thrift store.
241720	245640	These fucking pirate pants look like pirate pants, right?
245640	248200	I didn't do anything but rip the bottoms and make them a little shaggy.
248200	249200	It's fucking great.
249960	255120	Renaissance Fair, just guys go to the ladies section, and you get a big ass billowy shirt.
255120	257320	The wig, I don't know how I got this one.
257320	265520	Even specifically, they look like cookie thief, like you're a cookie thief.
265520	270400	It's hard to believe that there's a time and place in America when women were pursuing
270400	271400	the-
271400	275240	I don't know when these pants were ever anybody's idea, except for me to find them and make
275240	276240	pirate pants.
276240	277240	Fucking great.
277280	278280	Fucking great.
278280	279280	It's so comfortable.
279280	280280	I'm wearing these forever.
280280	281280	All right.
281280	283720	Jeff's happy.
283720	287840	I guess I'm experiencing my happiness through an angry valve.
287840	292680	A long time ago, years ago, let's say six years ago before we had ever gone to the
292680	297680	Renaissance Fair together, I was against Renaissance Fairs because it sounded really stupid.
297680	299320	It sounded like a big bummer.
299320	306760	It sounded like a lot of bad improv and a lot of people doing fake Elizabethan and whatnot.
306760	309320	Doing something stupid too seriously.
309320	316760	My friend Diva Zappa, the youngest of the Zappa clan, she also hated Renaissance Fairs
316760	318320	and she goes, I'm going to the Renaissance Fairs.
318320	319320	I was like, why?
319320	321440	She's like, because I hate it.
321440	322440	Because it's stupid.
322440	323960	I have to go look it in the eye.
323960	326560	I have to go confront my terror.
326560	328560	She went and I texted her the next day.
328560	329560	I go, how was it?
329560	330560	She goes, I applied for a job.
330560	331560	I'm like, what?
331560	335520	She goes, I don't know why.
335520	336800	I don't know why I like it.
336800	337800	I don't know if it's ironic.
337800	339120	I don't know if it's sincere.
339120	341600	I think it's a combination of both.
341600	344120	I know I need to be closer to that flame.
344120	348320	Something magical is happening there and it has absolutely nothing to do with history.
348320	350320	Nothing to do with academia.
350320	352320	There's no appreciation of anything.
352320	355360	Does the guy dress like a little finger?
355360	357280	Nobody fucking knows.
357280	359520	There's a million goggles.
359520	366280	The steampunk is a weird syphilitic vein that runs through it to the point where there's
366280	367680	no kiosks.
367680	372760	You can buy steampunk goggles at the Renaissance Fairs because they're like, somehow that overlaps.
372760	373760	Not somehow.
373760	375480	I know how.
375480	376480	That's the point.
376480	377480	I don't know.
377480	380360	It's just anything that you could wear that would make someone want to beat you up.
380360	386840	It's just a bunch of people wearing it going, who's going to beat me up?
386840	387840	Nobody's going to beat me up.
388160	393560	But there's also a lot of overt, like I would call generally, not a jock culture, not a
393560	398800	macho culture, but a lot of overt sexuality where guys are just wholesale.
398800	400200	That's the part I don't like.
400200	401200	All right.
401200	402200	On to that.
402200	406120	Hashtag rape culture.
406120	412720	If you have a Tumblr blog and you would like to get outraged, holy choledo.
412720	413720	That's right.
413720	419960	It's a choledo with a C-H. It's a Cheeto form of Toledo.
419960	422160	It's an extra cheesy, holy Toledo.
422160	428880	If you're a 17-year-old girl and you would like to be a social activist, if you're interested
428880	438280	in rape culture and the illumination of it, start at Erwindale, California, where people
438280	443400	are juggling and just going like, every fucking booth you walk by, they go like, oh, glass
443400	446120	and they're like, oh, hello, milady.
446120	450880	Would you like a hard six inches of something hard and transparent to go up into your purse?
450880	455520	Like every fucking thing is like a joke about non-consensual sex.
455520	456520	Absolutely.
456520	462680	Oh, I went like the drip my meat on the globes of the thing and everybody's just like, it's
462680	463680	none of it's inventive.
463680	471640	On the flip side, the women are- Weird Al Rapavik is what I would call the vibe.
471640	478360	You're kind of like connecting semantic dots like, oh, I make a rain stick, oh, there's
478360	483160	a hard, hard eight inches of wood, oh, milady.
483160	488120	Just because something looks like a dick doesn't mean you can say it's a dick and threaten
488120	493400	to hit someone with it and come with them, come on them.
493400	496440	They're really thinking still there in the middle of that field.
496440	502440	They're like, well, truthfully, if you can connect those dots, if something looked like
502440	511280	a dick, if it was longer than it was wide, whether you were selling a candle or a glass
511280	519280	or a sword or a turtle, it's satire.
519280	524120	I think it's satire of rape is what we're selling.
524120	529080	From what I've heard, and I cannot verify this, but from what I've heard, first hand,
529080	531000	I've gone now to, I would say four of these, right?
531000	532160	We've gone to four, right?
532160	533160	I think we've gone to four.
533160	537080	Four and five years we've gone.
537080	544760	There are certain groups that go to the Renaissance Fair and Pleasure Fuckfest and some are war
544760	549400	camps or the people that put on the war pageants and the jousting bits and stuff like that.
549400	557200	Some are old, Medici-looking, Borgia, Italian kind of clans, and they stay there.
557200	561240	They stay there for the whole, I think the whole goddamn time, and I believe they stay
561240	562240	in character.
562240	563240	And they get down.
563240	564240	They get down.
564240	565240	They get down.
565240	569960	When the sun goes down, as you're leaving, if you're leaving the Renaissance Fair, as
569960	576160	the sun is starting to set, and it's time to get the pain, the pain, the pain, the
576160	577160	pain.
577160	581360	Everybody that works there has already got sights set on somebody that they're just
581360	584640	like, I'm going to fuck that corn dog selling lady over there so much.
584640	588160	I'm going to fuck that corn dog lady.
588160	589160	I'm just yesterday.
589160	590160	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
590160	591840	I'm going to fuck that corn dog lady.
591840	598920	From what I've heard, that when the pain customers leave and when the lights that don't exist
598920	601160	go down.
601160	610680	When the anachronistic lights go down in the non-city, do I want to be there using a
610680	613600	period excuse to not use a condom?
613600	614600	Whoa.
614600	622400	From what I've heard, and maybe somebody in our audience here tonight can hit me to the
622400	623640	actual details.
623640	624640	What I've heard is that-
624640	625640	I would be surprised.
626640	633480	I bet there's three people here tonight who lost their virginity at a Ren Fair.
633480	636680	Or that served as corn dogs four hours ago.
636680	640720	But I've heard that it's like a rampant STD situation because nobody wants to wear condoms
640720	641720	because that ain't period-
641720	642720	It's period-correct.
642720	647840	Yeah, you don't want to be an anachronistic and not give somebody herpes or AIDS or whatever.
647840	652280	I've heard that it's just like, it's just spirochetes of poppin' and then the old spirochetes
652280	653280	of poppin'.
654280	655280	All right, all right.
655280	658280	Hey, can anybody verify or deny that?
658280	659280	No.
660280	663280	Yes, I am professor.
663280	664280	What was it?
664280	666280	Like a guy would come up and-
666280	669280	No, someone could say they worked at a thing.
669280	671280	That's what I've heard, but apparently it gets really-
671280	672280	I'm so drunk.
672280	673280	I'm so drunk.
673280	674280	But it's fine so far.
674280	676280	Can we talk about the party bus a little bit?
676280	677280	We're in a party bus.
677280	678280	We're in a party bus.
678280	685280	There's limos, and there's lims-vines, and there's limousines.
685280	689280	There's hum-vines, and there's all kinds of different-
689280	693280	There's golden doodles and chippewoches.
693280	696280	There's different kinds of vehicles you can get.
696280	700280	If you get a party bus, that's a fucking-
700280	704280	That's a bus that they usually relegated to, you know,
704280	715280	developmentally empowered students,
715280	718280	where they've stripped the tent off the windows
718280	720280	and then put it back on.
720280	723280	Like, now it's for partying.
723280	727280	What I'm saying to you kids is it's a short bus,
727280	729280	but they've taken out all the seats,
729280	732280	and then they put plywood on the floor, and-
732280	734280	There was at least one stripper pole in it.
734280	736280	There was a stripper pole in it.
736280	738280	Because, you know, yeah, it's just like,
738280	741280	how else are you going to dance and have a good time?
741280	743280	There was a hole under my feet.
743280	746280	I sat in the back, and there was a hole that you could see the highway.
746280	748280	There's a freeway underneath your feet.
748280	751280	You can look down, and it's concrete.
751280	752280	You can see it.
752280	754280	Like, I'm wearing slippers.
754280	756280	If my slipper fell off, that was the end of that slipper,
756280	758280	because there was just the freeway underneath it.
758280	761280	You could drop your phone down that hole
761280	763280	and never see it again.
763280	765280	Hug me up with a beat.
765280	766280	Boop, boop, boop.
766280	767280	No, I'm kidding.
767280	768280	I don't know why that's-
768280	769280	Also-
769280	770280	I'm really drunk.
770280	771280	I'm really drunk.
771280	772280	And before-
772280	773280	Dan, let me say-
773280	774280	Let me use my phone and say,
774280	775280	I'm doing it off my iPhone
775280	777280	because I didn't remember to bring my iPad.
777280	778280	That's why tonight's going to be great.
778280	779280	Yeah.
779280	780280	We're going to-
780280	783280	I'm on the beat section.
783280	784280	In case you want to beat-
784280	785280	You could-
785280	786280	What, wasn't there a-
786280	787280	Okay.
787280	790280	Did you guys see my $70 wooden cup I'm drinking out of?
790280	791280	They told them-
791280	794280	They told them that the wood enhances the flavor.
794280	796280	It enhances the flavor of the beer.
796280	798280	You guys just made out of wood.
798280	800280	That doesn't make any sense.
800280	804280	Because you'd have to, like, coat it with some kind of plastic, like-
804280	806280	You don't know that, man.
806280	808280	It's no such thing as a wooden cup.
808280	810280	All right.
810280	813280	The idea that it enhances the flavor is funny.
813280	815280	Also, I thought I was being environmentally sound
815280	817280	because I went to a show the other night
817280	819280	and there was a charity there that was funding it
819280	821280	and it was all about not using-
821280	824280	Not refusing to use one-use plastic.
824280	827280	So, like, not having a plastic water bottle
827280	829280	or, like, the order food to go-
829280	831280	I don't want the plastic fork.
831280	832280	I'm taking it home.
832280	834280	I don't want the plastic fork that I'll use once throw away
834280	837280	and it ends up in one of the gyre systems in the ocean.
837280	838280	Yeah, great.
838280	840280	Like, I don't want the straw.
840280	841280	I'll drink it without the straw.
841280	842280	That's a very noble thing.
842280	846280	So you go to the rent fair and you buy a nice $70 wooden cup
846280	849280	that enhances the flavor of the beer.
849280	852280	And then they can't pour it into the goddamn wooden cup.
852280	853280	Yeah, they can't do it.
853280	854280	They have to pour it into a plastic cup
854280	857280	that you pour into your beer and then they throw it out.
857280	859280	It's fucking bullshit.
859280	860280	Yeah.
860280	862280	How'd you get so drunk and high, Dan?
862280	863280	Walk us through it.
863280	864280	How'd your day start?
864280	865280	Well, I was gonna-
865280	866280	Well, okay.
866280	869280	Before we bring other people in.
869280	870280	I didn't-
870280	872280	Wasn't there a news item?
872280	875280	Wasn't there a party bus where a woman was dancing
875280	879280	and she was party busing and then she fell through the floor?
879280	880280	No one heard about that?
880280	881280	Okay.
881280	882280	All right.
882280	884280	Well, let's not worry about it.
884280	886280	Wait, I'm worried about it.
886280	891280	Tonight we were brought to the rent fair by firstimpressions.com.
891280	892280	Look them up.
892280	897280	Dan had a flintlock gun, like not quite a blender bus,
897280	900280	but sort of like a flintlock musket, we'll call it.
900280	902280	And you left it at the goddamn restaurant.
902280	903280	I fucked up.
903280	904280	I had it the whole time.
904280	906280	We walked into El Compadre down the road
906280	908280	and people were unhappy about it.
908280	909280	No, no.
909280	910280	We were well received.
910280	911280	I don't know.
911280	912280	Today was great.
912280	915280	I went to the men's room and one of the waiters came up
915280	916280	and said, no, no, no.
916280	917280	The lady's room is that way.
917280	919280	Then I turned around and he's like, ah!
919280	920280	But that's just him.
920280	921280	He's just-
921280	922280	I'm seven feet tall.
922280	923280	Yeah, but he-
923280	926280	This is West Hollywood.
926280	928280	It doesn't mean we had a bad time.
928280	929280	No.
929280	932280	We had a good time today.
932280	934280	I can't believe that parrot stayed safety pinned
934280	937280	to your shoulder the entire time.
937280	938280	I forgot.
938280	939280	Jesus.
943280	944280	All right, come on.
944280	945280	Give me a beat.
945280	946280	Give me a beat.
946280	947280	Let's fucking rap.
947280	949280	I'm gonna fucking rap.
949280	951280	Why do these people come here?
951280	953280	Let's fucking rap.
953280	954280	Yeah.
954280	955280	Yo.
955280	956280	Smooth rap.
956280	957280	Yeah.
957280	958280	Yeah.
958280	959280	Smooth.
959280	960280	Slow.
960280	961280	Smooth.
961280	962280	You want it faster?
962280	963280	You want a faster rap?
963280	964280	No.
964280	965280	No.
965280	966280	All right.
966280	967280	No.
967280	968280	Smooth rap.
968280	969280	Yo.
969280	970280	I'm from the streets.
970280	971280	Rap.
971280	972280	I'm from the tip to the sky to the top of the floor.
972280	973280	I'm gonna fuck your mama down to the ceiling and floor.
973280	974280	I just-
974280	977280	I just rhyme the words floor and floor and when I'm done
977280	980280	getting fucking your mama gonna rhyme some more.
980280	983280	I fucked your mama in her knee and her eyes.
983280	986280	I fucked your mama with her shoe and her thigh.
986280	989280	I fucked your mama's legs, fucked your butt.
989280	992280	I fucked your mama in the eye and your dad said,
992280	993280	what?
993280	996280	I said, hey, mister, don't mean offense.
996280	998280	I'm just fucking your wife.
998280	1001280	It's the best defense.
1002280	1006280	And he was like, whoa, okay, let me process this.
1008280	1011280	And after a while, he was open to it.
1012280	1015280	He got dressed up as Spider-Man, sat on a chair,
1015280	1019280	and watched me fuck your mama, and he didn't seem to care.
1019280	1022280	He started rubbing his crotch and getting hot.
1022280	1025280	I fucked your mama like her name was Tater Tot.
1025280	1028280	I fucked your daddy, too.
1028280	1032280	I fucked everyone and you.
1033280	1034280	You were taking a bath.
1034280	1036280	I came creeping in and said,
1036280	1039280	let me help you with your math.
1039280	1044280	Two plus two is four, but what's going down below here and more?
1044280	1047280	Can you look at balls and stroke your shaft?
1047280	1049280	I was like, head with the angry inch.
1049280	1051280	You're fucking doing that.
1051280	1053280	Yeah, down the drain.
1053280	1056280	Everyone's homophobia is catching the train.
1056280	1060280	We're going cross country and more.
1060280	1063280	Every culture is going to advance more.
1063280	1066280	Everybody's cool with everything.
1066280	1069280	Yeah, all the races.
1069280	1073280	Yeah, fuck your mama some more.
1073280	1075280	Black people, gay people.
1075280	1078280	Dan Herman, everybody. Dan Herman.
1078280	1081280	Is that what you wanted?
1084280	1087280	I know that's why you came here tonight.
1087280	1091280	I thought your rap would be a little bit more Renaissance-y.
1091280	1094280	I thought it would rhyme more.
1095280	1097280	I thought there would be more rhyming.
1097280	1100280	It rhymed plenty when you were rhyming the same word.
1100280	1102280	I thought your mama would have a shoe.
1102280	1105280	I thought I'd put on a sock and put on a shoe.
1105280	1108280	I'm really drunk and high.
1108280	1110280	I can't stress the high part enough.
1110280	1112280	I need people to know I'm also high.
1112280	1113280	Yeah?
1113280	1115280	Yeah, you're not allowed to just say you're drunk.
1115280	1116280	How high are you?
1116280	1118280	I'm super high.
1118280	1122280	All right, so let's bring it up.
1122280	1125280	No, come on. The show's going great.
1125280	1128280	We've been off for a month.
1128280	1131280	No, we're coming back with the best show ever.
1131280	1134280	There's nothing...
1138280	1142280	Let's get Kumail Nanjiani out here.
1142280	1157280	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
1157280	1163280	By the way, you don't look like your face doesn't match the Renaissance era,
1163280	1168280	but you really were born in the wrong time, my friend.
1168280	1170280	But you saw Spencer, right?
1170280	1172280	Oh, of course, but we all know that.
1172280	1176280	Spencer is the last guy that would bother to dress up for something,
1176280	1179280	but if a Renaissance guy came through a portal,
1179280	1183280	if he caught a glance at Spencer, he'd be like,
1183280	1186280	Hey, what's going on?
1186280	1190280	Spencer looks like a fucking alchemist,
1190280	1194280	and all he did was put on a mustard shirt at a vest.
1194280	1198280	Yeah, Spencer could be wearing a Ninja Turtles shirt in the time travel.
1198280	1200280	He's like, what on my own?
1200280	1202280	Let's bring Spencer out just to...
1202280	1204280	Spencer!
1214280	1216280	You guys are dressed like assholes.
1216280	1218280	Yeah, sorry.
1219280	1221280	Where did you get that hat?
1221280	1223280	It's just my hat.
1223280	1226280	When the sun's out, that's the hat you put on?
1226280	1228280	Just going to the game.
1228280	1230280	It's great, yeah. It's got a very straight bill.
1230280	1233280	It doesn't impede my vision.
1233280	1236280	No, I got all this stuff at a costume place.
1236280	1238280	I just went in there and came out.
1238280	1240280	Was that your first Renaissance fair experience?
1240280	1244280	This was my first, all sorts of experiences.
1244280	1247280	I drank mead. There was a turkey leg involved.
1247280	1250280	I was surprised that you wanted to go.
1250280	1252280	Uh, okay.
1253280	1255280	Did you have a good time, Spencer?
1255280	1257280	Yeah, I mean, it's like a state fair,
1257280	1260280	except everyone's acting all dumb and weird.
1260280	1263280	Oh, so you have a very different take than Dan does.
1263280	1265280	No, I loved it, but everyone's like,
1265280	1269280	oh, the Lord wants to duck it for his coop.
1271280	1273280	I'm like, no, I want a cider.
1274280	1277280	What does meat taste like? Is it just like beer?
1277280	1279280	I mean, it's not as good.
1279280	1281280	I mean, well, beer's not. I don't know.
1281280	1283280	Alcohol tastes alcoholic,
1283280	1287280	and then it has these weird flavors that taste bad.
1288280	1290280	That's about all I've been able to understand
1290280	1293280	in terms of flavor profile of alcohol.
1295280	1296280	I'll get there. We're fine.
1296280	1298280	I wish I'd gone.
1298280	1300280	I just got back in town this evening.
1300280	1301280	I would have loved to have gone.
1301280	1303280	Yeah, what have you been up to?
1303280	1304280	Nothing, right?
1304280	1308280	Aside from being the star of a hit television show on HBO.
1312280	1315280	Yeah, I haven't been up to anything.
1315280	1317280	I've just been hanging out.
1317280	1319280	I was in Atlanta, which is actually...
1319280	1321280	Is anyone from Atlanta?
1321280	1323280	It's like a pretty good city.
1323280	1325280	It's the best city in the world.
1325280	1326280	It's what?
1326280	1327280	It's the best city in the world.
1327280	1328280	Is it? Okay.
1328280	1330280	That's crazy.
1330280	1332280	Yeah, I remember Woody Allen made that movie
1332280	1334280	Midnight in Atlanta.
1335280	1338280	What a great movie that was.
1339280	1344280	I remember the black and white one called Atlanta.
1347280	1349280	Was that Casablanca?
1349280	1350280	No.
1350280	1352280	I was going with Woody Allen, so it was Manhattan.
1352280	1353280	Oh, Manhattan.
1353280	1355280	That is fantastic.
1356280	1359280	Don't they have all the traffic lights?
1359280	1361280	They're on strings? That's weird.
1361280	1363280	What?
1363280	1365280	They're just hanging from strings.
1365280	1367280	Why can't you just let a city do something?
1369280	1371280	Well, you know, here we have them on poles and stuff.
1371280	1373280	What are the strings hanging from? The stars?
1373280	1375280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1375280	1376280	No, the ceiling.
1376280	1377280	The ceiling?
1377280	1378280	The ceiling.
1378280	1379280	The ceiling of Atlanta?
1379280	1380280	The ceiling.
1380280	1383280	He doesn't know. Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him.
1383280	1386280	Atlanta, the entire city is indoors.
1386280	1389280	You should have mentioned it's under a doe.
1389280	1391280	I don't know why we didn't bring that up.
1391280	1393280	I didn't even notice. I barely look up.
1393280	1394280	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
1394280	1396280	Well, they have these big wide roads,
1396280	1397280	and they have a lot of traffic signals,
1397280	1399280	and they just have like six or seven traffic signals
1399280	1402280	just on this big string that's strung between two poles.
1402280	1403280	It's weird.
1403280	1406280	It's not even, it's not funny. It's weird.
1406280	1409280	I didn't notice that. Is that right, Atlanta?
1409280	1411280	She disagreed.
1411280	1413280	I've been there like two or three times.
1413280	1416280	That was literally the only takeaway I had.
1417280	1421280	When you're there, you feel like the city's trying to make you fat.
1421280	1422280	That's the takeaway I took.
1422280	1425280	They're like, you don't want, for a side, you want a fried chicken biscuit?
1425280	1427280	Just for a side, it was $2.
1427280	1429280	I was like, yeah, that's just a side.
1429280	1433280	It was like a full fried chicken sandwich for $2.
1433280	1438280	That's how I felt in Nashville and Portland and everywhere but Los Angeles.
1439280	1442280	Los Angeles is the only city where there's such a thing as a restaurant.
1442280	1448280	It's like, well, we're, you know, high protein, low lactose.
1448280	1452280	Like you can go in and get a little square of fish.
1452280	1456280	We were at this, the same diner, and this guy was there, and he was very nice,
1456280	1459280	and we ordered food, and we told some funny story, and he laughed,
1459280	1461280	and he was like, the funniest thing happened earlier today.
1461280	1462280	You guys missed it.
1462280	1466280	This woman came in, and I'm not going to do the Southern accent,
1466280	1470280	but like imagine like a racist version of that,
1470280	1473280	and then don't change anything.
1474280	1476280	And he's like, funniest thing happened earlier today.
1476280	1479280	This woman came in, and she asked for toast.
1479280	1484280	She asked for gluten-free, and then we were like silent
1484280	1487280	for what seemed like three minutes.
1487280	1491280	It's just like staring like, is there more to this story?
1491280	1492280	Nope.
1492280	1494280	I think the world was silent for three minutes,
1494280	1497280	and then one put in our order.
1497280	1500280	Good story, guy.
1501280	1506280	So has life changed for you now that you're, I mean,
1506280	1512280	it seems like you've been at a very linear 45-degree rise.
1512280	1516280	Like, I don't perceive your life as changing in quantum shifts,
1516280	1522280	but you are now a regular character on this, like, judge show.
1522280	1523280	Yeah.
1523280	1529280	I'm curious, have you perceived any shifts happening in your reality?
1529280	1533280	No, I mean, I get recognized more,
1533280	1536280	but you know the kind of recognized where they're like, hey, how's it going?
1536280	1539280	Where they think I went to like college with them or something?
1539280	1540280	There's a lot of that.
1540280	1542280	Where people are like, hey, how are you?
1542280	1545280	I'm like, good, I've never seen your face before.
1545280	1548280	They don't put it together a lot of times.
1548280	1550280	How are your mom and dad taking this?
1550280	1554280	Well, they're taking it by not bringing it up at all.
1554280	1558280	So it aired, you know, it aired, and I was like, hey, watch the show.
1558280	1560280	Two weeks went by, and they did not bring it up.
1560280	1564280	And then I said, hey, did you watch my new show?
1564280	1565280	And she said, yeah.
1565280	1570280	And then it was silent for longer than it was silent with that waiter in Atlanta.
1570280	1574280	She didn't say anything, and then she was like, it's good.
1574280	1575280	And that was it.
1575280	1576280	Great.
1576280	1578280	This is all I want from them.
1578280	1579280	I don't want them to love it.
1579280	1582280	First of all, fuck, I do want them to love it.
1582280	1586280	If your son is on a show, even if you don't love it, fucking love it, you know?
1586280	1589280	Love the fucking show that your son is on.
1589280	1592280	But even if you don't love it, just tell me you love it.
1592280	1593280	That's all I want.
1593280	1594280	What do you think?
1594280	1595280	Because that's a through line in your life.
1595280	1600280	You've told several of these kinds of stories where they're terse about your career.
1600280	1606280	What do you think there is blocking them from just being effusive or being upfront about
1606280	1607280	what they don't like about it?
1607280	1608280	I don't know.
1608280	1611280	My brother was in town, and he sees him every other week.
1611280	1616280	He lives by them, and we were hanging out, and I hadn't really hung out with my brother
1616280	1617280	as an adult very much.
1617280	1622280	And I was like, hey, so how's your relationship with our parents?
1622280	1627280	By the fact that says something.
1627280	1632280	Are their parents to you?
1632280	1633280	No.
1633280	1637280	And he was like, it's fucking weird.
1637280	1642280	And then we just bonded over how weird he said, he talked about how there's this wall
1642280	1644280	where we don't talk about.
1644280	1645280	There's a big filter.
1645280	1650280	Is that just because that's their identity, or could you expand that and say that's a
1650280	1652280	Pakistani kind of cultural thing, or no?
1652280	1653280	I don't know.
1653280	1660280	I mean, I don't know how many Pakistani parents have kids who are in HBO shows.
1660280	1661280	Is it a religious thing?
1661280	1665280	Are your parents devout Muslim, for instance?
1665280	1666280	They are devout Muslims.
1666280	1672280	But I think this is more like, usually when you have parents, your relationship evolves.
1672280	1676280	In the beginning, they're just your caretakers, and they're your disciplinarians.
1676280	1679280	And as you grow, it becomes more of sort of a friendly relationship.
1679280	1684280	You never become peers, but there's like a warmth to it.
1684280	1685280	Yeah, hopefully.
1685280	1686280	Yeah.
1686280	1692280	We have a warmth, but we never crossed the line into actually being able to talk about
1692280	1693280	stuff.
1693280	1696280	It reminds me of like Dan, like you and Shahab, and like my Midwestern friends.
1696280	1697280	Yeah, yeah.
1697280	1698280	That's a very Midwestern US thing.
1698280	1700280	No, it's funny how familiar that sounds.
1700280	1701280	That's right.
1702280	1708280	There's a weird filter there where I felt like my parents were like lizard people.
1708280	1719280	I remember being a kid and laying my head on my mom's lap, and then I remember the day
1719280	1725280	when my mom tried to touch me, and I was like, ah.
1725280	1730280	Religion did have something to do with it, but it was also, moreover, it was almost like
1730280	1737280	there was an unspoken tradition about the nature of kids and their parents that I hit
1737280	1742280	an age where actually on both sides, there was an unspoken agreement that...
1742280	1744280	Like this is over.
1744280	1745280	Yeah.
1745280	1746280	We're not cuddly anymore.
1746280	1747280	Yeah.
1747280	1748280	Because there's no reason to be.
1748280	1749280	It's not you.
1749280	1750280	It's not me.
1750280	1751280	It's all based on logic.
1751280	1757280	When I see that Star Trek episode when Spock says like, wow, it's every seven years, here's
1757280	1761280	something I buried the lead on before I joined Starfleet.
1761280	1767280	Every seven years, I have to go back to my planet, and I got to fuck her fight.
1767280	1768280	Yeah.
1768280	1773280	I should have brought it up earlier, but the writers ran out of storylines this year.
1773280	1777280	Honestly, Captain Kirk, I got your back and everything else, but can you give me a ride
1777280	1780280	to third in Lancashire?
1780280	1783280	And Captain Kirk's like, okay, that's fine.
1783280	1785280	Is there anything you want to talk about?
1785280	1786280	Absolutely nothing.
1786280	1790280	And he just goes back to his planet and has to deal with all this shit.
1790280	1791280	There's a compartmentalization.
1791280	1792280	Yeah, certainly there is.
1792280	1797280	And I think part of it for me was I left when I was 17, and I wasn't like a person yet,
1797280	1799280	and then I became a person away from them.
1799280	1805280	And when they met me, I was like a person, and I think they never were able to reconcile
1805280	1806280	the person with their son.
1806280	1812280	So I think that divide is still there where they never really see me develop into an actual
1812280	1813280	human being.
1813280	1818280	Is that because they didn't feel they were a part of that change, of that shift?
1818280	1821280	I think it probably weirds them out that I'm not the same...
1821280	1823280	I'm very different from when I was a kid.
1823280	1825280	I was very, very shy.
1825280	1827280	I wouldn't talk...
1827280	1829280	Okay, this is kind of revealing.
1829280	1830280	It's weird.
1830280	1833280	I had this weird thing until I was pretty...
1833280	1835280	Well, I was very shy.
1835280	1837280	I couldn't buy stuff at the store.
1837280	1842280	I thought they wouldn't sell me stuff here in the States or back home?
1842280	1843280	Back home.
1843280	1844280	I was like...
1844280	1853280	Because I thought that I was very ugly always until I was pretty old, and so I thought,
1853280	1857280	oh, the stores won't sell me stuff because I'm ugly.
1857280	1858280	What did you want?
1858280	1861280	A handsome hat?
1861280	1865280	I feel ugly again.
1865280	1866280	Come on.
1866280	1869280	Sell me the chips.
1869280	1870280	No, I just felt weird.
1870280	1871280	I don't know.
1871280	1876280	And so I was very, very shy and introverted, and then they suddenly met me, and I was more
1876280	1879280	outgoing and talkative and stuff, and so I think that was weird for me.
1879280	1883280	Where did that extreme shyness come from?
1883280	1887280	Can you trace that back in a minute?
1887280	1893280	Well, it came from how I thought I looked, and that's how it came, which was weird.
1893280	1898280	Did you ever ask your mom if you were handsome?
1898280	1900280	No.
1900280	1904280	I did.
1904280	1905280	How old were you?
1905280	1906280	Tell me how old.
1906280	1907280	Yeah.
1907280	1910280	I asked my mom if I was good looking.
1910280	1913280	I want to know what room in the house you were in.
1913280	1914280	Yeah.
1914280	1915280	Set the scene.
1915280	1916280	Interior.
1916280	1920280	I was in my living room, and I want you to word it exactly as you word it.
1920280	1926280	I was in my living room, and I think it was 14 or 15th, and I...
1926280	1928280	Old enough to not say it.
1928280	1929280	I asked my mom.
1929280	1933280	That's funny that one detail could make a story go from funny to sad.
1933280	1934280	Hello, Mommy.
1934280	1935280	Am I handsome?
1935280	1936280	What?
1936280	1937280	You guys thought I was 23?
1937280	1938280	Yes.
1938280	1939280	You thought I was some kind of loser?
1939280	1940280	Yeah.
1940280	1941280	I get it.
1941280	1944280	No, you thought you were fucking eight, dude.
1944280	1945280	I know.
1945280	1946280	I know.
1946280	1947280	Just a joke.
1947280	1952280	I'm getting my learner's permit to drive a car soon, but tell me, am I handsome, Mommy?
1952280	1956280	I asked my mom if I was handsome.
1956280	1957280	Would you...
1957280	1963280	If you had to go back and sort of pinpoint when your relationship with your mom got weird...
1963280	1965280	No.
1965280	1966280	Damn.
1966280	1970280	Did you ask her to rate you from zero to 10?
1970280	1971280	Wait.
1971280	1973280	I mean, so she...
1973280	1979280	In my mind, she's like in the kitchen, like putting a sandwich in a bag.
1979280	1981280	She's having a normal day.
1981280	1984280	She doesn't know what's going to happen.
1984280	1986280	She didn't buy a ticket to this ride.
1986280	1989280	All I do is get pregnant at 22.
1989280	1993280	A five foot ten gentleman walks into the kitchen.
1993280	2001280	A Ralph Macchio felt hat yin yang on the sleeve of his frosted denim jacket.
2001280	2005280	Mom, am I good looking?
2005280	2006280	What happened?
2006280	2007280	Is that what you want?
2007280	2008280	What'd she say?
2008280	2013280	She laughed.
2013280	2014280	That's what anyone would.
2014280	2017280	Well, as the audience did just now.
2017280	2018280	Right.
2018280	2019280	Yeah.
2019280	2020280	I mean, that's the thing.
2020280	2021280	I'm realizing.
2021280	2023280	I'm the weird one.
2023280	2025280	That's a tough...
2025280	2027280	That's a tough whacking nerd.
2027280	2029280	That's steeple to chase.
2029280	2032280	What did her face do and what did her mouth say?
2032280	2040280	She immediately made it clear that that was one of the worst questions you could ever ask a mother.
2040280	2042280	And it was like, I don't know.
2042280	2043280	You're fine.
2043280	2045280	She just tried to get through it.
2045280	2048280	You know how they say everyone, like, in mother's eyes?
2048280	2049280	Even through the mother's eyes.
2049280	2052280	She's like, you're fine.
2052280	2055280	What had happened that day, Dan, that led you to that question?
2055280	2056280	Something must have happened.
2056280	2057280	I don't know.
2057280	2062280	I assume it was some girl in high school that was, I don't know, that was...
2062280	2063280	Were you going to let go?
2063280	2069280	Inexplicably not responding to my obsessive compulsive notes that I was giving her.
2069280	2071280	I said circle one.
2071280	2073280	Yeah.
2073280	2075280	Well, I haven't you circled one.
2075280	2077280	Was the plan to go back to your...
2077280	2079280	Maybe it's the shape of my face.
2079280	2081280	Hey, mom.
2081280	2087280	Was the plan to go back to your arm with your mom's response as a rebuttal?
2087280	2090280	I asked my mother.
2090280	2092280	It seems you are mistaken.
2092280	2094280	I believe you...
2094280	2096280	I believe you...
2096280	2098280	Guess what, Tracy?
2098280	2103280	Someone just told me I look like David Dukupne.
2103280	2105280	I have a list of references.
2105280	2106280	I think you might want to look over.
2106280	2109280	Yeah.
2109280	2110280	Oh, no.
2110280	2111280	I don't know.
2111280	2114280	Believe me, this will shock you.
2114280	2119280	At the age of 15, when I asked my mom if I was good looking, I didn't know what I was doing.
2119280	2121280	I had no idea where it was going to go from there.
2121280	2123280	And she said you're fine.
2123280	2124280	Yeah.
2124280	2127280	I didn't walk away from that conversation feeling handsome.
2127280	2129280	And that's not on her.
2129280	2131280	That's not a mom's job.
2131280	2132280	No.
2132280	2135280	Like you said, she just got pregnant at point of view.
2135280	2137280	She didn't sign up for you.
2137280	2138280	All right, buddy.
2138280	2140280	I imagine if I was just having...
2140280	2141280	Try not to smoke pot.
2141280	2143280	Take it easy on the skateboards.
2143280	2148280	I just had sex that one time and now you're in my kitchen being weird.
2148280	2149280	Yeah.
2149280	2151280	This is not fair to me.
2151280	2156280	I need a government subsidy if I'm going to be gauging this activity.
2156280	2160280	Yeah, you're real hot, stud.
2160280	2161280	Take your shirt off.
2161280	2163280	Use your hot pockets.
2163280	2164280	Get the fuck to school.
2164280	2166280	Get out of my house.
2166280	2168280	Jesus Christ, you're 15.
2168280	2171280	You're jerking off.
2171280	2173280	You're shooting cum everywhere.
2173280	2176280	I think no one should be talking to you about anything.
2176280	2181280	Just get the fuck out of here.
2181280	2183280	Thank God for video games.
2183280	2185280	Get the fuck out of my house.
2185280	2188280	Get the fuck out of my house, you weird fucking weird dude.
2188280	2191280	A scrawny Gary Busey looking fucking maniac.
2191280	2196280	I imagine you going back to playing video games and asking Mega Man the same question.
2196280	2198280	Am I good looking?
2198280	2199280	Yes.
2199280	2201280	Leisure suit Larry.
2201280	2204280	All right, let's get more of our friends out.
2204280	2207280	I...
2207280	2212280	Oh, brother.
2212280	2217280	Let's bring out my fiancé and Matt Gorley at the same time.
2217280	2234280	There's no way to quit.
2234280	2238280	No, Kumail's leaving.
2238280	2240280	We're trying to find more chairs.
2240280	2243280	Kumail will get another mic.
2243280	2250280	If I know Kumail, I'm really drunk and sorry.
2250280	2252280	What do you guys bring to the table?
2252280	2257280	What do you want?
2257280	2261280	These are just two other people that woke up too early.
2261280	2269280	Matt Gorley, Aaron, by the way, has a marvelous outfit on that she cobbled together.
2269280	2271280	Looks like a million bucks.
2271280	2275280	Matt, this is just a trip to your girlfriend's closet, if I'm not mistaken.
2275280	2280280	It's five minutes to my girlfriend's wardrobe.
2280280	2288280	Aaron, how many men implied that they would like to have non-conceptual sex with you
2288280	2296280	while you're walking on a circular dirt road around a bunch of vans?
2296280	2300280	I did leave the fair to go to rape Vanfield.
2300280	2302280	Everyone's like, you're gonna get angry.
2302280	2305280	That's what the renaissance fair is, rape Vanfield.
2305280	2310280	One of the actual booths is just a rape van.
2310280	2313280	It really is like, I don't know what the protocol for a guy is.
2313280	2316280	If you're walking with your girlfriend down a dirt road
2316280	2321280	and everyone's like, we're dressed like Toucan Sam and Barney Revel and whatever the fuck,
2321280	2323280	you know, everyone's like, oh, we're having a good time.
2323280	2329280	And if there's just a guy like at a glassblowing stand, if he goes like, glassblowing?
2329280	2331280	Oh, hello, my lady.
2331280	2336280	Oh, looks like you've got two glass bulbs that I'd like to blow on.
2336280	2340280	The nipples of those glass bulbs.
2340280	2343280	You're supposed to just keep walking, right?
2343280	2346280	That doesn't make me Willy Loman or anything.
2346280	2347280	You stab him.
2347280	2348280	You stab him.
2348280	2349280	There was a...
2349280	2352280	Am I supposed to stop and go like, hey, fuckface, what's up?
2352280	2354280	That's what they did, yeah.
2354280	2355280	I'm Adam Sandler.
2355280	2358280	I don't think any of those things were specific to me,
2358280	2364280	but there was a point where there was a nuts salesman or a ball salesman
2364280	2366280	that was like, how am I going to eat my nuts?
2366280	2369280	And Dan and I were joking about this very thing,
2369280	2371280	and I said, I just want to go to him and say,
2371280	2373280	yeah, I'm going to fucking eat your nuts.
2373280	2374280	I just want to take my hands.
2374280	2376280	I just want to squeeze your little baby nuts.
2376280	2377280	Just take it.
2377280	2379280	You want me to squeeze your nuts?
2379280	2381280	Does that feel good about your mom?
2381280	2385280	I mean, I'm going on and on, and Dan said,
2385280	2389280	Aaron, you're in a forest of children.
2389280	2390280	We had walked in.
2390280	2392280	She was doing that bed, and she's like, what if I said that?
2392280	2393280	And we were walking there.
2393280	2396280	There was like 18 children.
2396280	2401280	And between them, their collective age wasn't 30.
2401280	2403280	There was like half a dozen children.
2403280	2408280	Mind me, when does that woman want to squeeze that man's testicles?
2408280	2412280	There was this guy at the Mead Hutch or wherever we were.
2412280	2414280	And he was selling this special deal
2414280	2418280	where he had these like kush ball sponges full of cold water,
2418280	2422280	and he would put them on the backs of women to cool them down.
2422280	2424280	He was selling this, mind you.
2424280	2427280	And then the girl that had it done, her boyfriend was right next to him,
2427280	2430280	and then he put it on her chin, and he goes, look familiar.
2430280	2431280	What?
2431280	2432280	A boyfriend.
2432280	2434280	Wait, meaning that the sponges are like balls?
2434280	2436280	Yeah, because they were ball shaped.
2437280	2439280	Oh, there was someone with a mister who was like, get it all over your face.
2439280	2442280	That's what you're used to, aren't you?
2442280	2444280	You kind of fade away.
2444280	2448280	It doesn't hold up to the fucking cancer cold bear standard.
2448280	2452280	Like if you go in there with the slightest ounce of fucking,
2452280	2457280	if your Geiger counter is like, it won't last five seconds.
2457280	2461280	Everyone beyond those gates is like, oh, my balls are my dick.
2461280	2463280	You're like a fucking dick.
2463280	2465280	I'll wreck my dick on you.
2466280	2469280	I will say to their credit, all those men that are saying all those things
2469280	2471280	are very respectful on them.
2474280	2475280	That was such a dumb joke.
2475280	2476280	That was such a dumb joke.
2476280	2481280	Hey, real quick, a couple days ago I was watching,
2481280	2484280	I had Conan Deviard, and I was playing the commercials,
2484280	2487280	which is something you don't usually see commercials.
2487280	2489280	And I saw a promo.
2489280	2492280	This sounds like the dumbest, the worst.
2492280	2497280	So there was a promo for a news segment where they said,
2497280	2500280	proms to puzzles, an epidemic.
2500280	2504280	And then it cut to like a clip of these kids proposing to their girlfriends
2504280	2506280	at prom, and they're like too much too soon.
2506280	2508280	And I remember thinking like, oh, that's so silly.
2508280	2514280	Like that seems like a, I don't know, let the kids propose prom.
2514280	2516280	Totally unrelated from that.
2516280	2518280	I just met someone backstage named Luke.
2518280	2520280	Will Luke come on stage?
2520280	2521280	Luke, all right.
2521280	2522280	Unrelated.
2522280	2523280	All right, unrelated.
2523280	2524280	Luke.
2524280	2525280	Hey, real quick.
2525280	2527280	What are you doing for prom?
2527280	2529280	You want to go with me?
2529280	2530280	You good with that?
2530280	2531280	Yeah.
2535280	2537280	Wait, is he proposing?
2546280	2548280	Sorry, I hope he just said not at all what I expected.
2549280	2551280	I hope that was okay.
2551280	2554280	Wait, I'm really confused right now.
2554280	2556280	Are you guys in high school?
2556280	2559280	Yeah, it was an actual thing.
2559280	2563280	You just proposed, you just asked this girl to the prom.
2563280	2564280	Yeah.
2564280	2565280	And she said yes.
2565280	2569280	Oh, I thought you were saying, I know I was here, but I have a lot of questions, Luke.
2569280	2571280	You watched what happened.
2571280	2573280	By the way, she could not say no.
2573280	2576280	I thought you were saying, I thought you were saying, Aaron, that there are
2576280	2579280	kids that are proposing at prom for marriage.
2579280	2584280	Well, he's got another thing in his pocket that she's going to see at prom.
2584280	2589280	I thought that maybe that intro would qualify it in a way as to not embarrass Luke, but
2589280	2590280	maybe it embarrassed him.
2590280	2591280	No, no.
2591280	2592280	No, Luke is cool.
2592280	2594280	Luke's not the one who's embarrassed.
2594280	2595280	Can I do it again?
2595280	2597280	Can I do it again?
2597280	2599280	No.
2599280	2602280	Half the audience just said, no, you cannot do that.
2603280	2606280	Am I the only one here that thought you were saying a story about how kids are proposing
2606280	2607280	marriage at prom?
2607280	2608280	Yeah, that's what I thought.
2608280	2609280	Okay.
2609280	2610280	So I thought a 18-year-old or something.
2610280	2611280	That is what she was saying.
2611280	2612280	You were.
2612280	2613280	That was the story.
2613280	2614280	No, no, no.
2614280	2618280	They were talking about how kids are having very elaborate prom asking.
2618280	2620280	Oh, they're turning it into...
2620280	2622280	You got his name written on your hand.
2622280	2623280	They're having fun.
2623280	2626280	Well, he came up before and asked me if I could get him in.
2626280	2628280	Luke, what's the girl's name?
2628280	2629280	This is Haley.
2629280	2630280	Hello, Haley.
2631280	2633280	Are you happy about this prom proposal?
2633280	2634280	I could be up here.
2634280	2635280	Okay.
2635280	2638280	Let's take that again with more sincerity.
2640280	2642280	And action.
2643280	2644280	Are you guys friends?
2644280	2645280	Yeah, we know each other.
2645280	2646280	Yeah.
2648280	2650280	So I know you know each other.
2650280	2652280	They're like this.
2652280	2654280	Luke, how could I have done that better?
2654280	2655280	What were you hoping for?
2655280	2656280	I did great.
2656280	2658280	You did everything I expected you would do.
2661280	2662280	Why?
2662280	2664280	That sounds so creepy.
2664280	2666280	You did everything I expected.
2666280	2667280	Why is that an excitement?
2667280	2670280	He just used you as a ploy to do what you do.
2670280	2673280	And he's like, she'll do it bad, and then we can make fun of her,
2673280	2675280	and that's how we'll fall in love.
2676280	2679280	The dot I'm not connecting is they're not high school kids.
2679280	2680280	They are high school kids.
2680280	2681280	Oh, they are?
2681280	2682280	He's asking her to go to prom.
2682280	2685280	Proms, promposals.
2685280	2687280	Asking proms to posals.
2687280	2689280	Oh, it wasn't a marriage proposal?
2689280	2690280	No.
2690280	2691280	He's asking her to go to prom?
2691280	2692280	Yes.
2695280	2696280	Oh.
2696280	2698280	God forbid that go wrong.
2698280	2699280	Dan, where were you?
2699280	2701280	In the Renaissance?
2704280	2705280	That's happened.
2706280	2708280	Yeah, they're just, but you guys are just friends.
2708280	2709280	Yeah, that's great.
2709280	2710280	That's fine.
2710280	2711280	Okay, we've been friends.
2711280	2713280	Luke and Hailey.
2713280	2714280	They know each other from high school?
2714280	2716280	American friends or French friends?
2716280	2717280	Hang on, Hailey.
2718280	2719280	Luke and Hailey.
2719280	2722280	So your friends, you want to go to prom with each other,
2722280	2725280	or you at least wanted Hailey to go with you, Luke?
2726280	2728280	This is a culture of things that's happening
2728280	2731280	where kids are doing more and more elaborate proposals,
2731280	2733280	and so are we living in a world now
2733280	2736280	where you would come to a podcast and do that?
2736280	2739280	Are your friends also doing that sort of thing?
2739280	2741280	Yeah, they're a different podcast.
2742280	2745280	There's a guy at Douglas Movies right now.
2746280	2748280	Yeah, you couldn't have worked up a flashback.
2748280	2749280	Hailey.
2749280	2751280	They tried to get WTF, but, you know,
2751280	2753280	he's booked out for a while.
2753280	2756280	Hailey, do girls ask guys out in the same way,
2756280	2758280	or is it mostly a guy on?
2758280	2760280	Yeah, what's the Sadie Hawkins protocol?
2760280	2763280	Do girls also initiate, or is the only guys initiating it?
2763280	2765280	Oh, yeah, nothing for the girls.
2765280	2766280	The guys initiate?
2766280	2767280	But you could, right?
2767280	2769280	I mean, there's nothing precluding you from that, right?
2769280	2771280	You'd be spit on.
2771280	2772280	You'd be spit on?
2772280	2773280	What?
2773280	2776280	If a girl asked a guy, would you go to the prom with me,
2776280	2778280	the guy would spit on them?
2781280	2783280	She's saying, like, you're putting yourself,
2783280	2785280	as much as you're putting yourself out there,
2785280	2788280	a guy asking a girl to prom.
2788280	2790280	It's way more the other way.
2790280	2793280	Yeah, we haven't progressed to this point yet.
2793280	2795280	Look, be honest, Luke,
2795280	2798280	what percentage would you say that you thought that was a done deal?
2798280	2800280	Like, she was going to say yes.
2800280	2802280	Um, well...
2802280	2803280	50, 50, 80.
2803280	2805280	Be careful, Luke.
2806280	2809280	Yeah, I had that shit in the bag.
2810280	2812280	We're really good friends.
2812280	2814280	She doesn't go to my school, but she used to go to my school.
2814280	2816280	You know, I feel like she...
2816280	2817280	She expelled for a...
2817280	2819280	For going to too many proms.
2819280	2822280	She was the Hester Prynne of their high school.
2822280	2824280	A big pee on her chest.
2824280	2826280	She did ask a guy to prom?
2826280	2828280	Oh, yeah, and she got spat on. That's what she left.
2828280	2830280	Are you kidding me? What is happening?
2830280	2832280	It's a really bad set up to a joke.
2832280	2833280	No, no.
2833280	2834280	Luke, don't try with this.
2834280	2836280	You guys are what, 17, 18? How old are you?
2836280	2837280	I'm 18.
2837280	2838280	You're 18?
2838280	2839280	Mm-hmm.
2839280	2840280	And? Mm-hmm, okay.
2841280	2843280	Lily, you're 18?
2843280	2844280	You're 18?
2844280	2846280	As far as we know, yes.
2846280	2850280	Luke, when you asked your mom if you were physically attractive,
2850280	2853280	when you were nervous about today, what did she say?
2853280	2856280	No offense, I think Luke is the kind of guy that has the kind of looks where
2856280	2858280	he knows the answer already.
2858280	2859280	We all do.
2860280	2863280	Yeah, Luke's mom has been responding with fine.
2865280	2867280	She's opening with fine.
2867280	2869280	I just came from a dusty love festival.
2869280	2872280	He wanted to prove that he could ask a girl to prom in any way.
2872280	2874280	Like, he's just flaunting it.
2874280	2875280	Yeah.
2875280	2879280	He's like, I could poop will you go to prom with me on a plate?
2880280	2882280	Still still say yes.
2882280	2885280	I'm gonna take her to a show and embarrass the fuck out of her.
2886280	2888280	I'm fucking Luke, man.
2890280	2893280	I feel a little used by Luke a little bit.
2893280	2894280	Well, I'm jealous.
2894280	2895280	I'm jealous.
2895280	2899280	There was nothing, there was no amount of flowers I could give to a girl
2899280	2901280	that would make her do anything.
2901280	2911280	Spencer, what kind of high school romantic path did you forge?
2911280	2913280	I went to high school.
2914280	2917280	Did you do it in high school?
2917280	2919280	I went to high school.
2919280	2922280	Did you get any action?
2922280	2924280	I went to high school.
2925280	2927280	Did you attend to prom?
2927280	2928280	Yeah, yeah.
2928280	2930280	I mean, I had friends that were girls.
2930280	2932280	It's not hard to, you know.
2932280	2934280	Hey, do you want to go?
2934280	2935280	They're incredible.
2935280	2940280	You know, women, they love dressing themselves up.
2941280	2943280	No, I mean, prom.
2943280	2945280	Oh, write a book, my friend.
2945280	2946280	Proms?
2946280	2947280	Yeah.
2947280	2950280	Only Spencer could get away with saying that.
2950280	2953280	Yeah, and that's Jim Allen said that.
2953280	2956280	Or Tim Allen said it again.
2956280	2959280	Oh, Spencer being delightful.
2959280	2960280	I'm a delight.
2960280	2963280	Did you have a high school sweetheart?
2963280	2967280	No, I'm just dodging all these questions for no fucking reason.
2968280	2971280	If you know Spencer, you know he loves talking about this stuff.
2971280	2973280	It's not that far gone.
2973280	2976280	I'm talking about myself and the things I do and all my relationships.
2976280	2978280	There was a girl in high school.
2978280	2980280	I mean, there was tons of girls in high school.
2980280	2983280	Like, it was half the student body.
2987280	2989280	I remember, like, they're a big girl.
2989280	2991280	I remember, like, they're a big girl.
2991280	2993280	I remember, like, they're a big girl.
2994280	2998280	I remember, like, they're a big prom posals.
2998280	3001280	I'm going to keep on saying it until it's a real thing.
3001280	3003280	Did you go to any of the functions?
3003280	3005280	Did you go to any of the dances?
3005280	3007280	In high school, there actually weren't.
3007280	3010280	Like, for what we did, middle school had a lot of dances,
3010280	3014280	and then high school basically only had, like, homecoming and prom.
3014280	3020280	So I didn't go to homecoming because those were just, like, a glorified football game.
3020280	3022280	I mean, there was a dance, but no one even went to that.
3022280	3024280	It was just part of the football game.
3024280	3025280	Everybody went.
3025280	3026280	No.
3027280	3028280	Nerd.
3029280	3030280	I was there.
3030280	3033280	I was at the football game part, but, like, there was, like, an auditorium.
3033280	3034280	No one was in it.
3034280	3037280	Like, there was literally a dance that people weren't attending
3037280	3039280	because they were watching football.
3039280	3042280	I'm not going to defend football school.
3043280	3045280	Spencer went to football school.
3046280	3048280	That's where he learned his...
3048280	3049280	What is it?
3049280	3051280	The wolf-kicking dance?
3051280	3052280	Oh, yeah.
3052280	3053280	Yeah.
3053280	3056280	In the morning, we'd have to call the coyotes out of the field.
3056280	3057280	Yeah.
3058280	3060280	We need... There's a job for ten men.
3060280	3062280	No. Just send Spencer.
3063280	3067280	I mean, this is... That's, like, dramatized, but I was, like, that guy.
3067280	3068280	Like, there's weird stuff.
3068280	3069280	People would be like,
3069280	3071280	Hey, Spencer, can you climb onto that roof?
3071280	3074280	And, you know, eat that bug for me.
3074280	3075280	I need it.
3076280	3078280	I need someone to eat this bug.
3078280	3080280	Did you really eat bugs?
3080280	3081280	Not in high school.
3084280	3086280	I mean, people eat sushi.
3087280	3089280	They're water bugs, yeah.
3090280	3091280	Food's weird, man.
3091280	3093280	I mean, well, people actually...
3093280	3095280	People actually eat bugs, like, as a normal thing.
3095280	3096280	It's normal to them, I guess, right?
3096280	3097280	Sure, yeah.
3097280	3099280	I should have went with that first.
3101280	3102280	Sushi's a weird lead one.
3102280	3103280	I think... Well, fish are weird, too.
3103280	3107280	I don't eat anything that has a non-standard number of legs, so...
3107280	3109280	Two or four is okay.
3109280	3111280	No legs, fish, fuck off.
3112280	3113280	Eight legs.
3113280	3114280	What about oysters or clams?
3114280	3115280	I don't eat those.
3115280	3116280	What about amputee livestock?
3116280	3118280	How many? If it's two...
3118280	3119280	How would you know?
3119280	3120280	If it's two legs, then it's five.
3120280	3124280	But, I mean, you've probably eaten three-legged hamburgers in the past.
3124280	3126280	Yeah, but they were born with four legs, right?
3126280	3127280	Wait, what do you mean?
3127280	3128280	What?
3128280	3129280	Okay, sure.
3129280	3131280	What about, like, milk-fed three-legged veal?
3132280	3133280	I don't do veal, bro.
3133280	3134280	Oh.
3134280	3135280	What about lobsters?
3135280	3136280	No lobsters.
3136280	3137280	No lobsters.
3137280	3139280	Because of their non-standard amount of legs.
3139280	3142280	Well, they look like giant bugs, like...
3142280	3143280	They are giant bugs, basically.
3143280	3145280	Yeah, food doesn't have exoskeleton.
3145280	3147280	Bugs have exoskeleton.
3147280	3149280	So you won't eat lobster?
3149280	3150280	No.
3150280	3154280	By the way, I've got to say, the term amputee burgers has never been said before.
3154280	3156280	And Spencer, again, blazing trails.
3156280	3159280	No, I don't eat any seafood, and I don't...
3159280	3160280	It's not like a moral thing.
3160280	3162280	I'm just kind of creeped out by it.
3162280	3165280	You don't like... Because of the legs.
3165280	3167280	Yeah, that's part of it.
3167280	3168280	Too many legs.
3168280	3169280	Too few legs.
3169280	3170280	No, thank you.
3170280	3172280	Have you ever had good octopus?
3172280	3173280	No.
3173280	3174280	It's got, like, eight legs.
3174280	3175280	Yeah.
3175280	3176280	That's defined by its legs.
3176280	3177280	Sea turtles?
3177280	3178280	I'm telling you.
3178280	3179280	That's some good shit, bro.
3179280	3180280	Octopus is good shit?
3180280	3181280	Octopus is good.
3181280	3183280	Is it springy?
3183280	3184280	Yeah, it is.
3184280	3185280	It's rubbery.
3185280	3188280	Yeah, but when it's good, it's like...
3189280	3191280	It's like salty bubble gum.
3192280	3194280	When it's bad, bad octopus...
3194280	3198280	Bad octopus has, like, a rubbery skin on the outside of it.
3198280	3201280	I have an issue with this.
3201280	3203280	You and I have been dating for three years,
3203280	3206280	and we've gone out to several places where they have octopus.
3206280	3207280	And every time you get it, you're like,
3207280	3208280	ah, not the good stuff.
3208280	3210280	I don't believe you anymore.
3210280	3213280	You're ordering octopus, and you're this octopus expert.
3213280	3215280	But I think maybe you were drunk one time,
3215280	3216280	and you had octopus, and you were like,
3216280	3217280	that's the best.
3217280	3220280	And then every other time, I was in this.
3220280	3221280	And it was like meatloaf.
3221280	3222280	He just thought it was...
3222280	3223280	Yeah.
3223280	3225280	We've been to very fine restaurants where he's like,
3225280	3228280	no, not the same as...
3228280	3231280	I remember that a certain percentage of calamari is served
3231280	3233280	that is, like, cow anuses.
3233280	3235280	Yeah, pig butt.
3235280	3236280	Pig butts, the little...
3236280	3237280	Who cares?
3237280	3238280	I've heard that.
3238280	3239280	Then guess what?
3239280	3241280	Pig butt's delicious.
3244280	3247280	Nine out of ten pig anuses are fucking delicious.
3248280	3250280	Because...
3250280	3252280	I heard that story in NPR.
3252280	3253280	That's a real thing.
3253280	3254280	Yeah, it's a real thing.
3254280	3255280	I mean, it's not...
3255280	3256280	Well, yeah.
3256280	3257280	All right.
3257280	3258280	Pig, yeah.
3258280	3259280	Some of it's pig anus.
3259280	3260280	It's good.
3260280	3261280	All right.
3261280	3262280	All right.
3262280	3264280	It's time for our next segment.
3264280	3265280	Uh-oh.
3265280	3266280	What time is it?
3266280	3267280	Nine out of three.
3267280	3268280	Oh, shit.
3268280	3269280	Yeah.
3269280	3272280	There's a lot of people out here tonight.
3273280	3278280	We started doing the show again.
3281280	3282280	We shared...
3282280	3283280	I'm a little...
3283280	3285280	I may be a little drunk.
3285280	3288280	Also, a little bit high.
3288280	3289280	But...
3289280	3290280	How did you get high?
3290280	3291280	I didn't see you smoking.
3291280	3292280	Shut up!
3292280	3293280	It doesn't...
3293280	3294280	We were on the same bus.
3294280	3297280	It smelled like Willie Nelson's bus.
3297280	3298280	Okay.
3298280	3300280	And it's just a sheet of plywood with four wheels
3301280	3302280	and there was some joints.
3302280	3303280	What bus were you on?
3303280	3305280	I was on the bus paying attention to things.
3305280	3306280	How did you not get high?
3306280	3308280	I don't know.
3308280	3309280	All right.
3309280	3310280	Anyways.
3310280	3311280	It doesn't matter.
3311280	3312280	I'm 41.
3312280	3315280	I need to grow up.
3315280	3318280	I need to be a better person.
3318280	3322280	This is all very irresponsible.
3322280	3325280	These people paid $10.
3325280	3328280	They came here in record numbers tonight.
3328280	3333280	I would like to start a new religion.
3333280	3334280	Just...
3334280	3337280	Just to do it.
3337280	3342280	Because I just finished listening to Going Clear,
3342280	3345280	the book about Scientology.
3345280	3346280	Is it...
3346280	3347280	What's the perspective?
3347280	3348280	Is it like...
3348280	3349280	It's like...
3349280	3352280	Starting a religion is like a fucking gangbusters,
3352280	3355280	fucking financial jackpot.
3355280	3357280	But also it helps a lot of people.
3358280	3359280	No.
3359280	3360280	For real.
3360280	3361280	I'm not kidding.
3361280	3362280	Here's the thing.
3362280	3364280	Going into it, you think of Scientology,
3364280	3367280	you have all these weird kind of voodoo,
3367280	3368280	you heard about it,
3368280	3371280	and you have these weird urban legends
3371280	3373280	that you've heard about it.
3373280	3374280	Yeah.
3374280	3377280	There's fucking crazy people that are in charge
3377280	3378280	and all this stuff,
3378280	3380280	but listening to that book,
3380280	3383280	the 600-page book, the story of the thing,
3383280	3386280	what emerges is the same thing that emerges
3386280	3388280	when you watch Book of Mormon,
3388280	3389280	which we just saw.
3389280	3394280	People make too much fun of new modern religions.
3394280	3396280	They're fucking new.
3396280	3398280	Of course they're gonna say that,
3398280	3401280	yeah, Jesus has a toothbrush for a hat.
3401280	3404280	Of course they have nothing else to do.
3404280	3406280	They're fucking like...
3406280	3408280	They're out in the wind, man.
3408280	3409280	It's a new religion.
3409280	3412280	Yeah, their only fault is that they're so new
3412280	3414280	that they can talk about stuff that...
3415280	3416280	They have the concept of aliens,
3416280	3418280	so now aliens are part of it.
3418280	3419280	Yeah, and then everyone's like,
3419280	3422280	wow, let's think about that.
3424280	3427280	Scientology, it's a pretty good racket.
3430280	3433280	Those motherfuckers, they got some shit going on.
3433280	3435280	The money changed hands,
3435280	3438280	and the fucking IRS went toe to toe with them
3438280	3440280	and they fucking beat them.
3440280	3442280	They beat the government.
3442280	3443280	That's a good religion.
3445280	3448280	Any religion that beats the fucking shit
3448280	3451280	out of the government, holy shit.
3451280	3453280	What I love is when you get really worked up,
3453280	3455280	it looks like your parrot is nodding along
3455280	3456280	for what you're saying.
3456280	3458280	He's like, yeah, that's right.
3458280	3460280	That's a good religion.
3461280	3465280	Those fuckers sat in a room with the IRS at one point.
3465280	3467280	See? He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3467280	3470280	And the IRS was like,
3470280	3471280	we don't know what to do anymore.
3471280	3474280	You've bankrupted our fucking legal department.
3474280	3478280	And Scientology was like, yeah, we're on our knees too.
3478280	3482280	Truce, ceasefire, they fucking made a fucking agreement
3482280	3485280	with the best.
3485280	3488280	What are some of the tenets of your new religion?
3488280	3489280	Okay, well, here's the thing.
3489280	3492280	Okay, so here's the thing, okay?
3492280	3495280	Forget that money making stuff he just mentioned.
3495280	3496280	I swear to God.
3496280	3498280	That's how not to start a religion.
3498280	3500280	Best part of our new religion,
3500280	3504280	the L. Ron Hubbard of it doesn't give a fuck.
3504280	3506280	Like, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't,
3506280	3508280	I have no money to make.
3508280	3509280	I don't want to, I don't...
3509280	3511280	You just said the opposite.
3511280	3512280	No, no, no, no, no.
3512280	3515280	I don't want to make any money.
3515280	3517280	Oh, there, there, okay.
3517280	3518280	You have to pee, sorry.
3518280	3519280	Oh, you have to pee.
3519280	3520280	I'm sorry.
3520280	3522280	You got synchronized pee?
3522280	3524280	There's a stress test in the bathroom.
3524280	3526280	You can fill that out.
3526280	3527280	There's two cans.
3527280	3529280	You can't flush it unless you hold the cans.
3529280	3531280	There's a pee meter in there.
3531280	3533280	No, I, uh...
3533280	3535280	It did seem like for two people that had to pee,
3535280	3536280	like, they were very like,
3536280	3538280	no, I have to, oh, my God.
3538280	3540280	I felt like they were Scientologists.
3540280	3543280	Yeah, they're calling Scientology right now.
3543280	3546280	Which is fine, because I mean, I, anyways,
3546280	3548280	I read the book.
3548280	3553280	A lot of people, like, benefit from any religion that you start.
3553280	3556280	You don't have to actually rob anybody blind.
3556280	3557280	You don't have to do anything.
3558280	3561280	Like, Dianetics, when L. Ron Hubbard wrote Dianetics,
3561280	3563280	it was kind of an open source kind of thing.
3563280	3565280	You should also say that, like, when you were listening
3565280	3568280	and reading to that movie, that movie, that book,
3568280	3571280	that your reaction every moment of it was like,
3571280	3572280	oh, my God, this is fucking crazy.
3572280	3574280	These people are mistreating these other people.
3574280	3577280	Like, that's your, but you were also like,
3577280	3580280	oh, God, I could make my own religion.
3580280	3582280	So that's possible.
3582280	3585280	But, like, your reaction to Scientology
3586280	3589280	as a religion isn't like, oh, God, this is great.
3589280	3591280	This is doing so much good for people.
3591280	3594280	Any religion does great for people.
3594280	3597280	If you can call it a religion, it's doing good for people.
3597280	3599280	There is no such thing, really.
3599280	3602280	The only thing that hurts people is, like,
3602280	3604280	weird, is government.
3604280	3607280	It's people, it's when you tell people
3607280	3611280	you have to go into a fucking double-wide trailer
3611280	3614280	and sit in there with no air conditioning
3614280	3615280	and do these things.
3615280	3616280	That's not religion.
3616280	3617280	That's fucking government.
3617280	3620280	Did you change your mind since reading this book?
3620280	3621280	What are you talking about?
3621280	3622280	What do you mean?
3622280	3623280	I don't know.
3623280	3624280	I don't want to tell you that.
3624280	3627280	I'm saying, like, when you, if you say to people,
3627280	3629280	I have a way, I have a philosophy,
3629280	3632280	I have a way for you to connect with the unknown
3632280	3634280	of the universe, there's no way that can hurt anybody.
3634280	3635280	That's not true.
3635280	3636280	Yeah, it could.
3636280	3637280	What do you mean?
3637280	3639280	All you have to do is give me all your money
3639280	3640280	and go shoot up this building,
3640280	3641280	and then you'll get into heaven.
3641280	3642280	But that's government.
3642280	3643280	What?
3643280	3644280	No, but then you're preying on it.
3644280	3645280	That could be one of those people.
3645280	3648280	When you tell people what to do, then you're,
3648280	3649280	that's not religion.
3649280	3651280	That is religion.
3651280	3652280	Religion tells you what to do.
3652280	3655280	So then you think Scientology is government.
3655280	3656280	Okay.
3656280	3658280	You think Scientology is government,
3658280	3659280	so you want to make your own government.
3659280	3661280	Or you want to make your own religion that's not Scientology.
3661280	3664280	No, you could make a religion that didn't have anything to do.
3664280	3666280	You would never have to tell anybody what to do.
3666280	3667280	Well, then what would people do?
3667280	3669280	Well, then stop comparing it to Scientology.
3669280	3671280	So you wouldn't respect a religion
3671280	3675280	unless it fucking branched over into politics and government?
3675280	3676280	No, no, no.
3676280	3679280	But you're saying that if you tell people what to do,
3679280	3682280	it's government, and Scientology does tell people what to do.
3682280	3683280	All religions do.
3683280	3684280	So then technically it's government.
3684280	3686280	Okay, forget Scientology.
3686280	3689280	But I mean, all religions tell people how to act.
3689280	3690280	Yeah.
3690280	3691280	It's a huge part of it.
3691280	3694280	What I read in that book is like...
3694280	3696280	Even your parents disagreeing with you.
3697280	3698280	About...
3700280	3701280	He's shaking his head.
3701280	3703280	That's the first time he shook his head the whole time.
3703280	3704280	Yeah.
3704280	3707280	Which, by the way, is physically impossible for it today.
3707280	3709280	Must be religion.
3710280	3715280	We tend to politicize religion in a way that makes you say,
3715280	3720280	okay, Mormonism, Scientology, Jehovah's Witness,
3720280	3724280	like, we weigh them on this scale.
3724280	3727280	But don't you think they politicize their own religion?
3727280	3731280	But we're too predisposed to do that.
3731280	3732280	I have a quick question.
3732280	3734280	And this is not to counter anything.
3734280	3735280	I'm curious.
3735280	3738280	So I have a family member who's involved in the Christian religion,
3738280	3739280	and she really...
3739280	3740280	Get her out.
3740280	3741280	Get her out.
3741280	3744280	So she espouses this belief that she believes she's taught
3744280	3747280	where the Lord will provide and will take care of it
3747280	3750280	and has been in two unhappy marriages
3750280	3752280	and won't divorce for that reason.
3752280	3754280	And there's nothing political about that.
3754280	3756280	How would you answer to that?
3756280	3757280	Well, I didn't...
3757280	3760280	I'm too drunk and high to have heard all of it, but...
3764280	3766280	What I'm trying to say is that...
3766280	3768280	Now that the parrot just cried.
3769280	3771280	I didn't actually think anything I said would be that controversial.
3771280	3773280	I'm pleased that it is.
3773280	3775280	I'm glad I got that response.
3775280	3779280	It's unintentional because truly, whatever I'm trying to say,
3779280	3781280	it shouldn't really be that controversial.
3781280	3785280	All I'm trying to say is that there's a component of every religion
3785280	3791280	that just atones the individual consumer with the unknown
3791280	3794280	and costs nothing and doesn't demand anything else.
3794280	3796280	But that's not at all what Scientology is about as far as I think.
3796280	3798280	But we're talking about...
3798280	3799280	But when you...
3799280	3802280	But you're rooting for Scientology because they beat the government.
3802280	3803280	No.
3803280	3804280	Okay, I'm sorry.
3804280	3805280	That was a different thing.
3805280	3807280	They also feed up on people's pocketbooks
3807280	3809280	and make them rob from their families and friends
3809280	3813280	to pay for the unfucking known results of whatever they're fucking doing.
3813280	3816280	I know people that went through it and they got a lot good out of it.
3816280	3819280	Actually, there's a lot about Scientology that's clean living and like...
3819280	3823280	Christianity is the same and they're doing it on the surface of like, that's fine.
3823280	3825280	Every religion is about clean living.
3825280	3828280	Every religion is about looking within yourself,
3828280	3833280	figuring out what you're ashamed of and laying it out there and coming clean.
3833280	3836280	And there are people within every religion,
3837280	3839280	even the ones that we call cults,
3839280	3844280	there are people that belong to those organizations who get benefit out of it,
3844280	3846280	who are just in the middle of the bell curve,
3846280	3847280	who are just like,
3847280	3851280	oh, I walked into this thing and a guy told me,
3851280	3854280	put on this red hat and you're part of red hat-ism.
3854280	3859280	And red hat-ism means that you flap a hat up and down
3859280	3860280	and then you go like,
3860280	3865280	I used to think that I was a bad person for jerking off
3865280	3867280	but now I don't feel that way anymore.
3867280	3872280	Like, good religion like a street hot dog,
3872280	3874280	like a dog on the street.
3874280	3876280	You guys really missed something.
3876280	3878280	Yeah, catch them up.
3880280	3885280	There are ordinary people who derive good results.
3885280	3886280	Sure, there are.
3886280	3888280	But it can be very good.
3888280	3890280	But it can be every religion that you would ever make fun of.
3890280	3892280	I know, there's a positive side to every religion
3892280	3894280	and that gives you something to believe in.
3894280	3895280	And they actually,
3895280	3897280	they're the ones that are keeping the things going.
3897280	3900280	We hear the crazy stories about magic underwear
3900280	3902280	or super duper hats
3902280	3906280	or like they paid this money to this political fund or whatever.
3906280	3910280	We weigh these religions on a triple beam scale.
3910280	3912280	So all I'm saying is,
3912280	3914280	okay, so if that's the problem,
3914280	3918280	then what if you started a religion that didn't have any of that?
3918280	3920280	If I could promise you,
3920280	3922280	no, fuck Buddhism.
3923280	3925280	The lady in the front row said Buddhism.
3925280	3926280	No.
3926280	3928280	I hope that's the title of this episode.
3931280	3932280	Because that's a bold thing.
3932280	3934280	Because there's not enough back end.
3935280	3937280	They didn't beat the IRS.
3937280	3940280	It's not, it's Buddhism.
3940280	3943280	There's too much Richard Gere involved in it.
3944280	3947280	You have a long way to go to explain your love of religion
3947280	3950280	and also the clear line you draw,
3950280	3952280	it has to be a prophet based.
3953280	3955280	There's not going to be a prophet.
3955280	3958280	I swear, I know you've heard this before.
3959280	3962280	But I swear I won't make any of you kill anybody.
3962280	3963280	I don't believe.
3963280	3964280	I don't believe.
3964280	3966280	Least of all yourselves.
3967280	3969280	I swear to God this time.
3971280	3972280	It's one.
3972280	3975280	I know it seems like,
3975280	3979280	here comes another one of these guys with the religion.
3980280	3983280	This time I swear you won't have to kill anybody.
3983280	3984280	Father Harmon.
3985280	3990280	Father Harmon, I saw your flyer at Froyo.
3992280	3995280	God, I just moved to Los Angeles
3995280	3997280	and I moved here with my husband and my daughter
3997280	3999280	and I came home and there was a note from him
3999280	4001280	saying that I was an unfit mother
4001280	4003280	and they've left me.
4003280	4006280	I can't afford to pay my rent
4006280	4007280	and I don't know who to turn to.
4007280	4009280	I know that I need something in my life.
4009280	4012280	I saw on your flyer that you offer.
4013280	4015280	You're not going to tell me what to do
4015280	4016280	but you're going to make me feel good
4016280	4018280	but also I owe you money and I just wanted to know.
4018280	4019280	You don't owe me any money.
4020280	4021280	No money.
4021280	4023280	I just, how do I, what do I do?
4023280	4025280	Just, do you play bass?
4027280	4029280	Because the first thing, we have a rock band.
4029280	4032280	Yeah, I play a little bass.
4032280	4034280	Our band is called Pillars of Fire
4034280	4038280	and we are meeting, that's the first thing.
4038280	4041280	We just need to put together a band.
4041280	4044280	The first problem with your religion
4044280	4047280	is that the band doesn't have a bass player.
4051280	4053280	Have you heard of the Rolling Stones?
4053280	4054280	Yeah.
4054280	4056280	Have you heard of Christianity?
4056280	4057280	Thank you.
4059280	4061280	Both of them needed bass players.
4061280	4063280	I'm a little drunk.
4063280	4066280	I'm just saying, here's what I'm saying.
4066280	4069280	I just got a contact drunk off of that story.
4071280	4073280	I think people listening at home just got drunk.
4073280	4074280	Yeah.
4074280	4076280	I agree with you because I think people
4076280	4080280	in our demographics seem to dismiss religion offhandedly
4080280	4082280	and without giving it any sort of thought.
4082280	4084280	All religion, the concept of religion,
4084280	4086280	the concept of religion at all.
4086280	4088280	Because every single religion...
4088280	4090280	I think it gives people a lot of stuff, important stuff.
4090280	4091280	I agree with you on that.
4091280	4092280	That's the hard part.
4092280	4094280	That's not what you were saying.
4095280	4097280	What is the secret that you're giving
4097280	4099280	or the comfort that you're giving?
4099280	4100280	Open source religion.
4100280	4102280	It's the first open source...
4102280	4104280	So it's like a Wikipedia of religion?
4104280	4106280	You can just add to it?
4106280	4109280	I'm out as soon as I fanged it.
4109280	4111280	So what if somebody comes in and goes,
4111280	4113280	I'm going to start taking some money?
4113280	4114280	People will abuse that money.
4114280	4115280	No, no.
4115280	4116280	They can't do that.
4116280	4117280	If anybody makes money off of it,
4117280	4118280	then it's not a religion.
4118280	4119280	It's a government.
4119280	4121280	Is there a theology to it there?
4121280	4122280	Yes.
4123280	4125280	There was a band without a bass player.
4125280	4128280	It seemed like there needed to be more religion
4128280	4130280	and I made one.
4130280	4131280	No, I don't know.
4131280	4133280	I'll figure that out later.
4133280	4135280	It also sounds to me...
4135280	4137280	Look, I have this sneaking suspicion
4137280	4140280	you haven't really thought this through that well.
4140280	4142280	And it sounds to me that perhaps
4142280	4145280	you kind of fancy yourself the leader of this religion.
4145280	4146280	Nope.
4146280	4147280	I swear to God.
4147280	4148280	I swear to God.
4148280	4150280	What God?
4150280	4151280	Harmon God.
4151280	4153280	What's your theology?
4153280	4156280	What is God in this new religion?
4156280	4158280	Spitball it.
4158280	4161280	I don't want... spoilers.
4161280	4163280	It's an open source religion.
4163280	4164280	What does that mean?
4164280	4166280	That means it's Tyler in the front work.
4166280	4167280	It means you do it.
4167280	4168280	He can...
4168280	4169280	He makes it.
4169280	4170280	Listen to him submit something.
4170280	4171280	I think the slogan,
4171280	4174280	the first religion with spoilers...
4174280	4175280	It's your new religion.
4175280	4176280	That's where you...
4176280	4177280	We don't even know yet.
4177280	4179280	Christianity is the first one with spoilers.
4179280	4182280	No, but he's available in his religion.
4182280	4183280	He rolls it out.
4183280	4185280	You know how they back into...
4185280	4186280	Okay.
4186280	4187280	Okay.
4187280	4188280	Okay.
4188280	4189280	Okay.
4189280	4193280	This is the beginning of a weird period of your life, I think.
4193280	4194280	Fucking A, man.
4194280	4195280	I'm 41.
4195280	4197280	This is your my step to becoming a Scientologist.
4197280	4200280	Also, look how you're dressed and you're saying this.
4203280	4204280	Got them.
4204280	4208280	Do you think there was a really ship-shaped screenplay in place
4208280	4212280	before they greenlit the Grinch that stole Christmas with Jim Carrey?
4212280	4213280	Are you saying that...
4213280	4217280	Or do you think they've camera-tested some yellow contacts
4217280	4219280	and they didn't know what the fuck they were doing?
4219280	4220280	Yeah, but they...
4220280	4225280	Best case scenario, your religion is as good as the Grinch who stole Christmas.
4225280	4226280	With Jim Carrey?
4226280	4228280	With Jim Carrey, right.
4228280	4232280	You can back into a project.
4232280	4234280	You can say, this is our goal.
4234280	4237280	You just wanted to be the Grinch who stole Christmas of religious?
4237280	4238280	No.
4238280	4239280	That's what you're shooting for?
4239280	4242280	I would rather be Fast, Furious, 7.
4242280	4243280	Whatever number...
4243280	4245280	It's not done yet and one of the actors died.
4245280	4247280	You can back into a number.
4247280	4248280	You can back into it.
4248280	4254280	So Dan, if the Grinch who stole Christmas by Dr. Seuss is to the movie
4254280	4258280	The Grinch Who Stole Christmas with Jim Carrey, what is the source material?
4258280	4259280	Like, what is the...
4259280	4261280	Like, if this is your religion, you're backing into...
4261280	4263280	Like, is there a thing?
4263280	4266280	Just a life-spent feeling.
4268280	4272280	And I know that makes me sound like a prophet and I don't...
4272280	4274280	I swear to God...
4274280	4276280	We don't think it makes you sound like a prophet.
4276280	4278280	I promise.
4278280	4280280	You have my word.
4280280	4281280	P-R-O-F-I-T.
4281280	4284280	If we get this thing I've been running, I am out.
4284280	4285280	I promise.
4285280	4286280	I'm not a prophet.
4286280	4289280	What is going on?
4289280	4290280	What is going on?
4290280	4291280	Where did she see...
4291280	4293280	I want to smoke what you had, man.
4293280	4294280	This is fucking wild.
4294280	4296280	You guys seem like you're taking this more seriously than I am.
4296280	4299280	Can we eat glass for the ready to start?
4299280	4301280	That pattern is way more interesting.
4301280	4302280	At what point you started...
4302280	4304280	You started wagging your finger at us.
4304280	4306280	You got really upset.
4306280	4307280	I'm sorry, I...
4307280	4310280	You want to do something terrible to people.
4310280	4311280	No!
4311280	4312280	I want to...
4312280	4317280	It's like the point where you disappeared into a sooth shack today and you came out changing.
4317280	4318280	Yeah, you're like, hell no.
4318280	4321280	He walks like an inch off the ground.
4321280	4323280	All right, well, for real.
4323280	4325280	All right, seriously.
4326280	4327280	All right.
4327280	4334280	Just think for a second about your fears about what happens after you die.
4334280	4341280	And just imagine for one moment that I knew...
4341280	4343280	He's not a prophet.
4343280	4344280	He's not a prophet.
4344280	4346280	I swear to God I'm not a prophet.
4346280	4348280	He's just a guy with a plastic carrot on his shoulder.
4348280	4352280	I'm saying hypothetically, if I knew.
4352280	4353280	That's my view.
4353280	4354280	My greatest fear is that you know...
4354280	4357280	Yeah, I don't want you to know.
4357280	4360280	If I did, then couldn't everybody...
4360280	4362280	Then why wouldn't you just tell us?
4362280	4363280	Out of beneath the system.
4363280	4364280	How many...
4364280	4365280	What's your...
4365280	4368280	What's the average salary of the people in this audience here?
4368280	4370280	What the fuck is going on, man?
4370280	4371280	I'm trying to alienate.
4371280	4373280	What kind of question is this?
4373280	4380280	What if we put it into building a compound?
4380280	4383280	Everybody's like, oh, I'm the big bad guy.
4383280	4385280	Oh!
4385280	4387280	Just think about it, you fucking...
4387280	4390280	You parasites!
4390280	4393280	Are you inferior?
4393280	4395280	They're definitely in that scenario.
4395280	4400280	If you guys can't see what I'm seeing, then maybe you should leave.
4400280	4408280	There's definitely a moment where someone's assigned to feed your parrot.
4408280	4411280	Speak to the people then.
4412280	4420280	Just think about what your soul wants.
4420280	4422280	Dan, I'm a plumber.
4422280	4424280	I make $10,000 a year.
4424280	4426280	Well, you should make $20,000.
4426280	4427280	No, Dan!
4427280	4429280	Take her for your wife.
4429280	4439280	I am the parrot Gabriel, fallen from heaven.
4439280	4443280	Just think about everything that you've ever wanted in your life.
4443280	4446280	And now imagine having twice as much.
4446280	4450280	And then now ask yourself why you don't have it.
4450280	4452280	And get mad!
4452280	4459280	I want you to get mad with me about you not having twice as much as you want.
4459280	4466280	You are allowed to have twice as much as you think you should have.
4466280	4472280	I just want to help you have more!
4472280	4475280	It's not rocket science!
4475280	4478280	And it's not a cult.
4478280	4481280	It's not religion, and I'm not a prophet.
4481280	4483280	I'm not doing anything to you.
4483280	4487280	You don't have to do anything I say, ever.
4487280	4494280	You just have to wake up!
4494280	4503280	You just broke the mike's sign of apathy.
4503280	4504280	We'll work on it.
4504280	4506280	Well, it's an open source religion.
4506280	4507280	It's open source.
4507280	4509280	You're going to feed into it.
4509280	4510280	What's it called?
4510280	4513280	It's called nothing, motherfucker!
4513280	4515280	It's called fuck you!
4515280	4516280	It's called...
4516280	4518280	It's called...
4518280	4520280	It's called...
4520280	4524280	Harmonology!
4524280	4526280	It's a working title!
4526280	4528280	It's called...
4528280	4530280	Harmonology!
4530280	4532280	I just made that up!
4532280	4534280	It's called...
4534280	4536280	It just fucking came out.
4536280	4538280	It just came out.
4538280	4540280	Harmonology!
4540280	4541280	I made it up.
4541280	4545280	This would have been such a fun time to bring up Luke.
4545280	4548280	All right, so usually at this time in our show,
4548280	4551280	we play Dungeons & Dragons.
4551280	4554280	But I refused...
4554280	4557280	Yeah, I was not allowed to leave.
4557280	4563280	I told Spencer he wasn't allowed to go and work on D&D.
4563280	4566280	So he just had to come up and sit here dressed like...
4566280	4569280	I've been writing holy writings for you behind the scenes.
4569280	4573280	But I told him that I would DM for him.
4573280	4576280	You could come up here and I'll DM for you.
4576280	4579280	Whatever anybody wants, I'll do anything.
4582280	4584280	I like the sound of that.
4584280	4587280	Dan, do you want to go to the table?
4587280	4589280	What time is it?
4589280	4590280	9.25.
4590280	4591280	Okay, that's a good time.
4591280	4592280	Oh shit, I really broke this.
4592280	4594280	You broke the mic, Stan.
4594280	4595280	Oh fuck.
4595280	4598280	All right, I'll pay for that.
4598280	4602280	Or you'll pay for it with your prayers.
4603280	4606280	Because it's not...
4606280	4608280	It's not a cult.
4608280	4612280	By the way, don't say that anymore.
4612280	4616280	Don't say if you're starting a cult that it's not a cult.
4616280	4618280	Oh, we don't need it.
4620280	4622280	All right, hold on.
4622280	4624280	All right, I'm gonna...
4624280	4627280	Okay, all right, thank you.
4628280	4633280	What the people at home missed was that Dan reached for a bottle of vodka
4633280	4637280	and then Aaron gave him a bottle of water instead.
4637280	4639280	Here's your...
4639280	4641280	Thank you.
4641280	4644280	All right, Dan, do you want to just...
4644280	4647280	I'll give you some music and you'll just freestyle an intro?
4647280	4648280	Yeah.
4648280	4650280	Are we continuing our own...?
4650280	4651280	No, this is a new campaign.
4651280	4652280	Everything is new.
4652280	4654280	Everything is canon, right?
4654280	4655280	This is not canon?
4655280	4656280	This is a new campaign.
4656280	4659280	This is a new RPG.
4659280	4661280	It's an Elseworld?
4662280	4664280	This is a new RPG I've developed.
4664280	4667280	It's called This World.
4667280	4669280	Okay, let's do it.
4669280	4670280	Harmon...
4671280	4672280	Oh, boy.
4672280	4673280	Great.
4673280	4675280	Sounds great, Dan.
4675280	4677280	Dan, are you ready to roll?
4677280	4680280	You guys are all playing yourselves, okay?
4680280	4682280	All of your stats are...
4682280	4684280	But I'll tell you where you are.
4684280	4686280	Okay, so we're not making up characters.
4686280	4687280	We're us.
4687280	4688280	I've got Jeff, Camille, Camille...
4688280	4689280	But I need dice.
4689280	4690280	I don't have any dice.
4690280	4691280	You have to pretend.
4691280	4692280	Yeah.
4692280	4693280	Well, let's...
4693280	4694280	Hit the table and see it.
4694280	4695280	Who has dice?
4695280	4696280	I have this.
4696280	4697280	Okay.
4697280	4698280	What?
4698280	4700280	Whatever for me has dice, which surprises almost nobody,
4700280	4701280	which is great.
4701280	4702280	What's your name, sir?
4702280	4703280	Dylan.
4703280	4704280	Dylan has dice.
4704280	4705280	Thank you, sir.
4705280	4707280	Dylan the Dice Man!
4707280	4709280	I love it.
4709280	4712280	By the way, perfect throw.
4712280	4714280	You hit him right in the hands.
4714280	4715280	Thank you.
4715280	4716280	Dylan's dice.
4716280	4717280	Dylan's dice.
4717280	4718280	This is all I need.
4718280	4719280	What do you play, Dylan?
4719280	4720280	What's your game?
4720280	4721280	Also, maybe like a...
4721280	4722280	D&D.
4722280	4723280	D&D, all right.
4723280	4724280	D&D.
4724280	4725280	Maybe like a pen and pencil so I can keep track of hit points.
4725280	4728280	How many hit points do I have in real life?
4728280	4730280	I can keep track of them.
4730280	4731280	I'll keep track of them.
4731280	4732280	Yeah.
4732280	4734280	Oh, Dylan, are these from the collector's edition
4734280	4737280	of the D&D, the box set thing?
4737280	4738280	Okay, whatever.
4738280	4739280	Okay.
4739280	4740280	All right.
4740280	4741280	Thank you, Dylan.
4741280	4742280	Oh, thank you.
4742280	4743280	See?
4743280	4744280	All right.
4744280	4748280	This is how religions actually start.
4748280	4749280	With dice?
4749280	4752280	Or like, I need one small thing.
4752280	4755280	And then you give it to them, and then they want the world.
4755280	4757280	And you want to have a mortgage they can sign over?
4757280	4758280	Thank you.
4758280	4761280	Spencer and Matt.
4761280	4765280	She had to look to see who's on stage.
4765280	4766280	My name's Jeff.
4766280	4767280	And I'm Kamau.
4767280	4768280	All right.
4768280	4770280	Plus, he's TV writing where you're not even really...
4771280	4772280	No.
4772280	4774280	I'd like to show you what I wrote.
4774280	4778280	And I can't wait to talk to you guys after tonight's show
4778280	4782280	and rob us of all of our worldly belongings.
4782280	4784280	I can't wait for you when you guys are like,
4784280	4786280	wow, that was fucking crazy.
4786280	4788280	You made up a new game.
4788280	4790280	Oh, I thought you checked with the religion.
4790280	4791280	Yeah.
4791280	4792280	Okay, now it's a game.
4792280	4793280	Oh, that too.
4793280	4795280	I can't wait for you guys next week to be like,
4795280	4797280	wow, this religion's taken off.
4798280	4800280	It's going to make people happy.
4800280	4802280	I don't want anyone's money.
4802280	4803280	You keep saying that too.
4803280	4804280	It's not a cult.
4804280	4805280	You don't want anyone's money.
4805280	4809280	It's not typically associated with the concept of religion.
4809280	4810280	Of course it is.
4810280	4812280	I'm not saying it's not involved.
4812280	4814280	It's not what comes to mind.
4814280	4816280	You think of crosses and bunnies and stuff.
4816280	4817280	Of course it does.
4817280	4822280	How many people thought about money after the word religion was said?
4822280	4823280	Yeah.
4823280	4825280	This is a problem.
4825280	4828280	Well, fuck all you guys who raise your hands.
4829280	4832280	They need a genuine fucking religion they can trust.
4832280	4833280	I hate this game.
4835280	4836280	It's a different thing.
4836280	4837280	This is a new RPG.
4837280	4843280	This RPG is not an indoctrination into my new religion.
4843280	4844280	I swear to God.
4848280	4852280	All right, I'm going off my iPhone, so I'll have to do what we'll do.
4852280	4854280	Play a new cool song.
4854280	4855280	Okay, you ready?
4855280	4856280	Yeah.
4861280	4862280	It's fine.
4862280	4863280	I don't care.
4864280	4865280	Introduce it.
4865280	4866280	That's fine.
4866280	4867280	I don't care.
4868280	4874280	Kumail and Jeff, you guys are in a three-foot cube.
4879280	4880280	Yeah.
4881280	4883280	Are we regular size?
4883280	4884280	Yeah.
4884280	4885280	Okay.
4885280	4886280	So that sucks.
4886280	4887280	Yeah.
4887280	4888280	Our lives suck.
4888280	4889280	Yeah.
4889280	4890280	Yeah, you're in it.
4890280	4891280	Okay.
4892280	4893280	Are we in liquid form?
4893280	4895280	Are there poop holes in the cube?
4896280	4898280	Or are we just pooping on each other?
4903280	4906280	You've only been there for like three minutes.
4906280	4908280	Okay, all right.
4908280	4909280	Okay.
4910280	4911280	All these questions.
4913280	4915280	You guys are in a three-foot cube.
4915280	4916280	Okay.
4917280	4921280	Matt and Aaron, you guys are in a boat.
4923280	4924280	That's way better.
4924280	4925280	Easy streets.
4926280	4927280	On a river.
4927280	4928280	Easy streets.
4928280	4929280	All right.
4929280	4930280	You're in a cube?
4930280	4933280	Spencer, you're in a rock.
4933280	4934280	You're in a giant rock.
4934280	4935280	I'm in a rock?
4935280	4936280	On a rock.
4936280	4937280	Oh, okay.
4937280	4938280	You're in a huge rock.
4938280	4939280	Okay.
4939280	4940280	On top of it.
4940280	4942280	How close are these three things to each other?
4942280	4949280	Spencer, you can see a river going east and west beneath you.
4949280	4950280	Okay.
4953280	4954280	He's not a prophet.
4954280	4956280	He's not a prophet, you guys.
4956280	4957280	No.
4957280	4959280	You guys are still in a three-foot cube.
4959280	4961280	Is it opaque or transparent?
4961280	4962280	Can we see out of it?
4962280	4963280	Yeah.
4963280	4964280	There's no light.
4964280	4965280	There's no light source.
4965280	4970280	So if we just end up there, it takes us a couple, like, be like, wait, is that you, Jeff?
4970280	4973280	Is the intro ever going to stop the music?
4973280	4974280	Wait.
4975280	4976280	Who's playing the music?
4976280	4977280	Me.
4978280	4979280	Stop it.
4980280	4984280	I was giving you Spencer intro music so you could set the scene.
4984280	4985280	Oh, well.
4985280	4987280	Did you not notice the music?
4987280	4988280	I like the props.
4988280	4989280	She not fucking noticed it.
4989280	4990280	Everyone noticed it.
4991280	4992280	Waiting for him to...
4993280	4996280	I thought you were going to set the stage for us.
4996280	4998280	With that music?
4998280	4999280	Really?
5000280	5001280	Okay, now the stage is set.
5001280	5002280	Now let's go.
5002280	5003280	He's on a rock.
5003280	5005280	No, you really thought I would set the stage to that music.
5005280	5007280	I think you did an appropriate job today.
5008280	5011280	I think you guys met in the middle.
5011280	5012280	Okay, go ahead.
5012280	5014280	Now with the stage set, we know where we are.
5014280	5015280	Are you saying that you guys...
5015280	5016280	Do you want better music?
5016280	5017280	If I give you spooky music, will you give us a spooky music?
5017280	5018280	You can give me any music you want.
5018280	5019280	I do.
5019280	5021280	Now that I know that I'm supposed to set the stage, I'll do that.
5021280	5023280	I gave you Blue Bell Polka by Jimmy Shannon.
5023280	5024280	Wait, he did set the stage.
5024280	5026280	That was the stage.
5026280	5029280	Dan, not that they're connected, but your parrot looks very embarrassed right now.
5031280	5032280	Do you want proper spooky...
5032280	5034280	Do you want proper spooky DM music?
5034280	5035280	Yeah, parrots.
5035280	5037280	I wish it was real parrots that could fly away.
5038280	5042280	I don't need anything, but I will set the stage.
5042280	5043280	You just...
5043280	5044280	Yeah.
5044280	5046280	Kumail and Jeff.
5051280	5054280	Where did your life go?
5058280	5061280	What happened in it?
5061280	5062280	In it.
5062280	5064280	You don't know.
5065280	5069280	As your blurry eyes blink and flicker...
5071280	5072280	Our eyes are flickerin'.
5072280	5077280	They start to take in what appears to be total darkness.
5077280	5080280	So take in nothing at all, okay.
5082280	5091280	Aaron and Matt, you also are confused about your previous goings and comings.
5092280	5096280	But find yourselves now in a boat raft.
5097280	5102280	Going east down a river, which seems to also go west.
5103280	5108280	Spencer, your knees are weary from kneeling.
5109280	5114280	As your aching muscles bend and break...
5115280	5117280	Your muscles break.
5118280	5120280	His muscles are breaking.
5121280	5128280	You rise up your six-foot frame, hulking into the sky air.
5129280	5132280	You take in the world around you.
5132280	5134280	Is this Goldavon?
5136280	5138280	The Lost Continent?
5139280	5141280	That your father told you about?
5143280	5144280	Who knows?
5144280	5147280	You are L. Ron Hubbard-ing so hard right now.
5148280	5149280	Creating a myth.
5150280	5151280	Goldavon.
5151280	5153280	I can do it better than him, man.
5154280	5159280	Could it be this world is yours for the inhabiting?
5159280	5160280	What's been happening?
5161280	5162280	Who could know?
5163280	5164280	And who could see?
5165280	5169280	It's up to you and up to me.
5172280	5177280	That sounded like, you know how sometimes you can translate a webpage into Russian and then back into English?
5178280	5179280	He's battlefishing.
5180280	5184280	Okay, so I put it at Kumail and Jeff's turn.
5184280	5186280	Remember? Remember? Remember? Remember?
5187280	5188280	Where did your mouth get to?
5189280	5190280	We're in a three-foot cube together.
5191280	5192280	Oh, yeah.
5192280	5195280	You feel a wriggling in the side of the three-foot cube with you.
5196280	5198280	It seems another person is in there with hum.
5199280	5200280	Hey.
5200280	5201280	Kumail, is that your asshole?
5201280	5203280	How did you recognize me by that?
5207280	5208280	And yes.
5209280	5219280	Look, deprived of all other sensory inputs, I just had a feeling that this was certainly a non-Giani a-hole.
5220280	5222280	Okay, you guys continue to talk about that.
5223280	5225280	I think one way out of this, I have a theory.
5226280	5229280	Maybe you should lick it. Maybe we'll see what happens.
5230280	5231280	There's a chance.
5231280	5232280	I lick Kumail's asshole.
5233280	5236280	You've spent that turn talking about it.
5237280	5238280	Spencer, you are...
5239280	5240280	It worked.
5240280	5242280	I mean, we're not out, but it worked.
5243280	5245280	You spent a round talking about it.
5246280	5247280	Spencer, you...
5247280	5248280	That's not a round.
5248280	5249280	That's not a round.
5249280	5250280	That's not a full action.
5250280	5252280	Well, I guess licking my asshole is the...
5252280	5258280	Tiny spider-sized holes open up in the box and spiders come in.
5260280	5261280	Oh, shit.
5263280	5265280	What's your... I'll tell you what your...
5266280	5267280	Spider save is.
5267280	5269280	At least my asshole got licked.
5269280	5270280	Fuck you guys.
5270280	5272280	You guys are getting bit by spiders.
5273280	5275280	Hey, spiders, work your way to my asshole.
5276280	5278280	They don't talk. You're getting bit by spiders.
5278280	5279280	Both of you take damage.
5279280	5281280	All right, Spencer.
5282280	5286280	You stand up on top of a big rock.
5286280	5287280	Sure, yeah.
5287280	5288280	You can see a river below you.
5289280	5291280	What do I... Do I have an inventory?
5291280	5293280	Yeah, you have three bags,
5294280	5295280	two ropes,
5296280	5297280	three sticks,
5298280	5299280	two shoes,
5300280	5301280	a hammer,
5302280	5303280	a corkscrew,
5305280	5307280	three foot strip of leather.
5307280	5310280	I take... I lash some of the strips of wood together
5310280	5311280	and create a frame,
5311280	5313280	and then I put a sack over it,
5313280	5314280	almost like a sackcloth,
5314280	5317280	and I put another sackcloth in a bundle atop,
5317280	5318280	almost like a head,
5318280	5320280	and then I put it down at the shore,
5320280	5323280	and I hide behind the rock and look to see...
5323280	5325280	If anyone sees this crude figure
5325280	5327280	I've constructed on the shore,
5327280	5329280	maybe by the riverside or something,
5329280	5330280	and I just sit and watch,
5330280	5332280	hoping for some clues from...
5332280	5333280	Galdivant?
5333280	5334280	Yeah.
5335280	5336280	This is the land.
5336280	5340280	This is a figure out of leather and sticks.
5340280	5342280	You sit behind a rock.
5342280	5343280	Yeah.
5343280	5344280	All right.
5345280	5346280	Aaron and Matt,
5347280	5349280	you're on a boat and you're going down,
5349280	5350280	you're heading east.
5355280	5356280	Could be worse.
5356280	5357280	We could be in a cube.
5359280	5360280	I'm pretty good at cubes.
5360280	5362280	I say we just rest this action out.
5362280	5363280	Relax.
5363280	5364280	I'm having a great time.
5364280	5367280	I don't want to bring any drama into the situation,
5367280	5368280	but I have some margaritas.
5368280	5370280	I was just going to offer you a mimosa.
5371280	5373280	Well, let's trade.
5373280	5374280	Here, I'll bring this to your mouth,
5374280	5376280	and you bring your drink to my mouth.
5376280	5378280	What's your perception?
5379280	5382280	What?
5382280	5383280	That life is pretty good.
5385280	5387280	And we don't need no religion.
5390280	5393280	You hear gurgling from the wood line.
5394280	5396280	Oh, maybe we've caught...
5396280	5397280	What's a wood line?
5397280	5399280	A tree line.
5399280	5401280	Oh, it's a wood line.
5402280	5405280	I mean, maybe we've caught some more fillets.
5405280	5406280	What's your dexterity?
5406280	5408280	Both of you have ten.
5419280	5429280	Matt Gorley, an arrow shoots from the wood line into your knee.
5429280	5432280	Wait, you had six options of body parts there.
5433280	5435280	Doing forward damage.
5435280	5436280	Oh, my knee.
5436280	5438280	This day was going so well.
5439280	5441280	You got shot in the knee.
5441280	5443280	It appears to be a goblin.
5443280	5446280	You recognize it as a goblin arrow.
5447280	5453280	They use a specific type of stone on the heads of their arrows.
5453280	5457280	Oh, it's quartz with a bit of theodolite.
5459280	5461280	Jeff and Kumail.
5462280	5464280	You feel the rustling.
5464280	5467280	Your cube is being rustled.
5470280	5472280	Hey, is there rustling?
5473280	5475280	I'm too busy being attacked by spiders.
5475280	5477280	Well, spiders aren't really dangerous, though.
5477280	5479280	I think it's just icky that they're here.
5479280	5481280	But it's not anything bad, right?
5481280	5483280	We took damage, though, didn't we?
5483280	5484280	No, we didn't.
5484280	5485280	Each of you took damage.
5485280	5487280	We're taking damage here, man.
5487280	5488280	Should we push?
5488280	5490280	On the count of three, let's push.
5491280	5495280	As hard as we can on all sides of this cube and try to get out of this.
5495280	5497280	I think I know what's going to happen.
5497280	5499280	One, two, three.
5507280	5509280	Matt and Aaron.
5515280	5520280	You hear a strange sound from below deck, kind of collapsing.
5520280	5523280	Oh, we're under the boat. We're in the boat.
5523280	5530280	Kumail and Jeff, the bright light hits your eyes for the first time in six months.
5530280	5532280	We've been in this cube for six months.
5532280	5534280	I thought it was three minutes.
5535280	5537280	This cube is full of shit.
5537280	5538280	It's full of shit.
5538280	5540280	So is the DM.
5540280	5543280	You hear male voices from below deck.
5543280	5552280	I brandished my goblin killing sword to protect myself because I'm going to take care of this guy.
5552280	5554280	I run downstairs.
5555280	5559280	Come party upstairs. Who's here?
5561280	5563280	That happens.
5564280	5567280	Hey, we're friends. Aaron, it's Jeff and Kumail.
5567280	5568280	Oh, guys.
5568280	5570280	I'll leave you alone.
5570280	5572280	No, no, no, no.
5573280	5576280	Matt, it's what we thought was going to happen.
5576280	5577280	Happened.
5577280	5579280	And I know we're very happy about it.
5579280	5581280	We should give them some time.
5581280	5582280	Yeah, let them do it.
5582280	5585280	I'm just putting some bactin on this old goblin wound down here.
5586280	5588280	The taint shirt, little poultice.
5588280	5589280	There we go. That's better.
5589280	5592280	I feel good, no matter what any dice roll will tell you.
5593280	5595280	Taking control of my own destiny.
5596280	5598280	Looking outside the glass bubble.
5598280	5600280	What is reality?
5601280	5611280	Spencer, from high atop your perch, you see in the distance to the west, moving down the river, a boat-shaped object.
5612280	5617280	Sailing in, in sailingness down the eastward direction.
5618280	5619280	Tell us, prophet.
5622280	5624280	Okay, so that, okay.
5624280	5625280	There's a boat.
5626280	5627280	Who's in that boat?
5627280	5633280	I'm going to, I'm going to lift up this crude effigy I made, and I'm going to attempt to hurl it.
5633280	5636280	I'm sure I'm going to fail, but I'm going to try and throw it at the boat.
5644280	5646280	I like your resolution mechanic system here.
5647280	5648280	Very unique.
5649280	5650280	A lot of rolls.
5652280	5655280	Aaron, Matt, and Kumail, you hear a splash.
5656280	5657280	Jeff doesn't even-
5657280	5658280	Jeff!
5659280	5665280	You see an effigy fly through frame and into the water.
5665280	5667280	My sister's drowning!
5668280	5671280	You hear a voice say that.
5671280	5672280	An effigy!
5674280	5675280	What, you heard it?
5675280	5676280	I heard it.
5676280	5677280	I saw it.
5677280	5678280	I heard it like an effigy splash.
5678280	5679280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5679280	5680280	Was that what it was?
5681280	5686280	I saw a thing, you said you heard what you think was an effigy?
5686280	5692280	I can't be a hundo, but it felt, it sounded like an effigy hitting the water.
5692280	5695280	I mean, I didn't hear it hit water, I just saw an effigy fly.
5695280	5696280	It was an effigy!
5696280	5697280	Oh yeah!
5697280	5698280	Fuck yeah.
5698280	5699280	Still got it.
5699280	5701280	Man, that sounded like a plain idol to me.
5701280	5702280	You got a good ear.
5702280	5703280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5703280	5704280	It's totally an effigy.
5705280	5708280	Scraaaaaaack!
5709280	5712280	Scraaaaaaack!
5713280	5714280	Scraaaaaaack!
5715280	5718280	I need perception numbers from each person.
5718280	5719280	Spenser?
5719280	5720280	I have plus 6.
5721280	5722280	Good.
5722280	5723280	I'm pretty astute.
5724280	5725280	I know all your perceptions.
5725280	5726280	Oh my God, good.
5726280	5727280	What's mine?
5727280	5729280	Oh, you rolled a 2.
5729280	5731280	No, what's my perception number?
5731280	5732280	You don't even know.
5732280	5733280	Oh.
5733280	5735280	So it must be bad.
5735280	5736280	Yeah.
5736280	5738280	How could you know?
5738280	5741280	Ask Schrodinger, where is his cat?
5741280	5742280	It's in the box.
5742280	5743280	Yeah.
5743280	5744280	Is it?
5745280	5747280	Yeah, dead or alive, it's in the box.
5747280	5748280	Well, I don't know.
5748280	5749280	I don't know.
5749280	5752280	The question we've got whether or not it's in the box.
5752280	5753280	I don't know.
5754280	5755280	Alive or not?
5755280	5756280	I don't know.
5756280	5758280	We all know it's in the box.
5758280	5760280	Who let this fucker drive?
5763280	5765280	Dragons are flying at you!
5765280	5766280	Dragons!
5770280	5771280	I throw it here.
5771280	5772280	Six dragons!
5772280	5774280	Six dragons.
5774280	5777280	I run below deck and I use my sword to hack open the box
5777280	5779280	to let out Camille and Joel.
5779280	5780280	Well, they're out!
5780280	5781280	Their box fell apart.
5781280	5782280	I don't know that.
5782280	5783280	So I'm doing it and I'm like,
5783280	5784280	I have six dragons.
5784280	5786280	Roll for initiative.
5786280	5787280	I'll roll.
5787280	5789280	None of you have initiative.
5790280	5792280	All the dragons have initiative.
5794280	5795280	Are you the dragon?
5795280	5797280	Six dragons.
5798280	5799280	How many dragons?
5799280	5800280	I hate this guy.
5800280	5801280	Six dragons.
5801280	5802280	Six dragons.
5802280	5805280	Each of them are the size of a football field.
5805280	5806280	God, I'm sick.
5806280	5808280	A hundred yards.
5809280	5811280	And their baby, just this is a foot.
5811280	5812280	How wide are they?
5812280	5813280	They're baby dragons.
5813280	5814280	How wide are they?
5815280	5816280	The hundred yards alone.
5816280	5817280	As wide as a football field.
5817280	5818280	Which is how wide?
5818280	5819280	Yeah.
5819280	5821280	As wide as the length of a football field.
5821280	5822280	30 yards.
5822280	5824280	As wide as the length of a football field.
5824280	5826280	They're perfectly square dragons, right?
5826280	5828280	They're Instagram dragons.
5828280	5829280	No, they're oblong.
5829280	5831280	They're oblong dragons.
5831280	5835280	They're a hundred yards long and 30 yards wide.
5835280	5836280	Oblong dragons!
5836280	5837280	Yeah.
5837280	5838280	Ice cream.
5838280	5839280	30 yards.
5839280	5840280	Yeah, get used to it.
5840280	5841280	Okay.
5841280	5844280	I summon Supreme Wrath.
5844280	5846280	They have initiative.
5847280	5848280	I still summon it.
5848280	5850280	Okay, so all six of them are going to attack.
5850280	5852280	I'm summoning it while you're doing it.
5852280	5854280	They're attacking you, huh?
5854280	5855280	He just has to kill us.
5855280	5858280	Good luck because I'm summoning Supreme Wrath.
5858280	5862280	So, one dragon attacks Aaron.
5867280	5868280	Holy shit.
5868280	5871280	One dragon asks his mom whether he thinks it's a dragon.
5871280	5872280	That's attractive.
5874280	5876280	One attacks Spencer.
5876280	5878280	One attacks Jeff.
5878280	5880280	One attacks Aaron.
5880280	5881280	You're fucking full of shit.
5881280	5884280	They're basically attacking all of you.
5884280	5887280	You each get attacked by one dragon.
5887280	5889280	I summon Supreme Wrath.
5889280	5891280	They have initiative.
5891280	5893280	You said they attack.
5893280	5896280	Yeah, wait to find the result.
5896280	5897280	Okay.
5897280	5899280	Jesus Christ.
5900280	5903280	Okay, so each dragon, you get attacked.
5905280	5906280	All right, you're all right.
5906280	5907280	You're all right.
5907280	5910280	A dragon tries to attack Camille and it misses.
5912280	5914280	Same thing happens with Jeff.
5914280	5916280	It chomps out on me.
5916280	5917280	It misses.
5917280	5918280	Supreme Wrath.
5918280	5919280	What are you supposed to do?
5919280	5924280	Oh, Gorillie gets bit on the shoulder by a dragon.
5924280	5926280	I don't need that shoulder.
5927280	5930280	Leaving him with 20.
5936280	5937280	Aaron gets bit.
5937280	5939280	I was attacked by two dragons.
5939280	5941280	Sixty.
5941280	5944280	Spencer gets bit.
5944280	5945280	I got bit 60.
5945280	5946280	Eighty.
5946280	5947280	Eighty.
5947280	5948280	Good job.
5948280	5950280	Basically what happens is...
5950280	5952280	I'm going to go...
5953280	5955280	Camille's walking over to...
5955280	5957280	This says 17.
5959280	5960280	That's a dragon.
5960280	5961280	That's an attack roll.
5961280	5962280	I was expecting his dice.
5962280	5965280	I have 17 equal 80 damage to him.
5965280	5966280	How does 17...
5966280	5968280	What math...
5968280	5971280	What math leads 17 to become 80?
5971280	5974280	It's an attack roll versus his armor roll.
5974280	5976280	Now the parrot looks guilty.
5976280	5978280	Is there a math where that can work?
5978280	5980280	No, I mean there might be some...
5980280	5983280	A high number means a hit.
5983280	5985280	Is it being multiplied by an imaginary number?
5985280	5986280	No.
5986280	5989280	What number multiplied by 17 gives you 80?
5989280	5990280	All right, let's continue.
5990280	5991280	That's not the damage.
5991280	5993280	For a guy who says he doesn't want to be a prophet,
5993280	5996280	you have tremendous God issues.
5997280	6000280	You guys are bummed out because you're getting attacked by dragons.
6000280	6001280	Am I as God?
6001280	6002280	I'm fine.
6002280	6004280	I don't think I have 80 hit points.
6004280	6009280	I fall on my knees and I summon the power of the God of Harmon.
6011280	6016280	What have you done, woman?
6016280	6019280	You killed us all.
6019280	6024280	I summon the God of Spencer, old school Spencer.
6024280	6029280	Spencer is dead when Aaron falls to her knees and she...
6029280	6030280	You just killed Spencer?
6030280	6031280	Yeah.
6031280	6035280	If I have less than 80 hit points, I think Aaron might have less than 60.
6035280	6039280	Aaron's saying things like, I know you're not a prophet.
6039280	6040280	I know you're not a prophet.
6040280	6042280	I know this isn't a big deal.
6042280	6044280	I know this isn't a religion.
6044280	6045280	Everything's fine.
6045280	6046280	You changed everything.
6046280	6048280	You changed everything, but you don't need to.
6048280	6052280	There's no money on the back end for you.
6052280	6054280	You're a good person.
6054280	6056280	You're very handsome.
6056280	6060280	And Spencer's wounds are healing.
6060280	6061280	They're closing up.
6061280	6063280	He's gaining strength.
6063280	6064280	He's becoming a more powerful character.
6064280	6065280	I thought I was...
6065280	6067280	Because Aaron did it right.
6067280	6069280	Didn't you say I was dead?
6069280	6070280	Did what right?
6070280	6074280	She prayed to me.
6074280	6079280	She said that I was a God and that I could, but she said that I didn't want to be.
6079280	6080280	Spencer is God.
6080280	6081280	He's healing.
6081280	6083280	All hail Spencer.
6083280	6084280	The Messiah.
6084280	6086280	The Messiah is God.
6086280	6087280	He's back.
6087280	6088280	Spencer.
6088280	6089280	Spencer.
6089280	6090280	Spencer.
6090280	6091280	Spencer.
6091280	6092280	You guys have it wrong.
6092280	6095280	You have it wrong.
6095280	6098280	A tree falls on Spencer.
6098280	6101280	It's a sign.
6101280	6105280	I want to try and dodge the tree.
6105280	6114280	When you dodge, do you say that you admire me?
6114280	6117280	Admire Dan Harmon.
6117280	6121280	Do you acknowledge that I don't want to be anybody's prophet?
6121280	6124280	I just want to help people.
6124280	6127280	I just want people to be happy.
6127280	6129280	No, that's fucked up.
6129280	6130280	He's dead.
6130280	6131280	I'm dead.
6131280	6133280	You didn't roll to die.
6133280	6134280	You didn't roll to die.
6134280	6139280	No, but there's some things in this universe that are fait accompli.
6139280	6141280	There's spiders all over all of you.
6141280	6143280	There's spiders everywhere.
6143280	6147280	There's a hundred spiders on each of you.
6147280	6149280	Are they poisonous?
6149280	6150280	Yes.
6150280	6153280	Fuck, I shouldn't have clarified.
6153280	6156280	I go down into the cube and just...
6156280	6159280	The spiders are laying dragon eggs.
6159280	6162280	Can I have a round of action?
6162280	6164280	I summon Buddha.
6164280	6167280	Okay, he's like, what?
6167280	6173280	He's, you know, some would call kind of a prophet as well.
6173280	6175280	I summon him.
6175280	6177280	Yeah, he's here.
6178280	6179280	Who takes this?
6179280	6183280	And I cast Logic Fights with Dan Harmon.
6183280	6184280	Logic Fights?
6184280	6185280	Yeah.
6185280	6187280	What, you want Buddha to fight Dan Harmon?
6187280	6188280	Dan Harmon's God, yeah.
6188280	6190280	All right.
6190280	6195280	This doesn't look good.
6195280	6202280	Buddha, like, he turns purple and he's like deflating like a balloon.
6202280	6208280	And I, Dan Harmon, like standing over him and Buddha's like dying.
6208280	6210280	He's dead.
6210280	6212280	He just killed Buddha?
6212280	6213280	Yeah.
6213280	6218280	Okay, I summon Allah and just know that this podcast is going out.
6224280	6225280	Okay, all right.
6225280	6228280	Let's see what happens.
6228280	6230280	I don't want to medigate.
6230280	6235280	He just shows up and Dan Harmon's like, what's up?
6235280	6241280	And Allah's like, hey, I have no quarrel with you.
6241280	6245280	And Allah's like, cool, word.
6245280	6246280	And he leaves.
6246280	6247280	He walks away.
6247280	6248280	He just goes away.
6248280	6249280	Typical.
6249280	6250280	Yeah.
6250280	6251280	But they're cool.
6251280	6253280	They're cool.
6253280	6254280	Buddha wasn't cool.
6254280	6259280	No, Buddha fucking crossed the line.
6259280	6261280	I summon Elrond Hubbard.
6261280	6262280	Elrond Hubbard.
6262280	6264280	Elrond Hubbard appears.
6264280	6265280	Okay.
6265280	6266280	All right.
6266280	6267280	Cool.
6267280	6272280	He turns purple and dies.
6272280	6274280	Allah's like, Allah's down the street.
6274280	6275280	I summon.
6275280	6277280	Because I don't want that trouble.
6277280	6280280	I summon your mom circa 1980.
6280280	6281280	All right.
6281280	6283280	My mom shows up 1980.
6283280	6284280	All right.
6284280	6288280	She's like, why are you, what are you doing?
6288280	6292280	I'm like, I cast.
6292280	6297280	I cast Find Me Attractive.
6297280	6298280	It doesn't work.
6298280	6305280	There's no number high enough on this job.
6305280	6307280	I charm her.
6307280	6309280	And she's like, you're a good writer.
6309280	6312280	Now I know it's a fantasy.
6312280	6315280	And she's like, you know, you should take a bath.
6315280	6317280	I hated season four.
6317280	6318280	All right.
6318280	6321280	So I'm taking a bath now.
6321280	6325280	With my mom's being a little too proactive about washing me.
6325280	6326280	Do you need it for this?
6326280	6330280	Or can we go?
6330280	6331280	I don't know.
6331280	6332280	It's good.
6332280	6333280	It's good to be clean.
6333280	6334280	You're going to make sure you're clean.
6334280	6336280	But I'm 11.
6336280	6338280	This is really, really fascinating.
6338280	6340280	It's fucked up.
6340280	6341280	All right.
6341280	6344280	This is one of the most lonely experiments I've ever seen.
6344280	6347280	Can we everybody just tiptoe out?
6347280	6349280	Guys, little secret.
6349280	6351280	Dan doesn't know any of you are here right now.
6351280	6353280	You guys show up for homework town next week.
6353280	6356280	And he's still rolling down to find out if mommy likes him.
6356280	6358280	She's like, OK, you're clean now.
6358280	6360280	But I'm crying.
6360280	6361280	I go to bed.
6361280	6363280	And I'm like, I'm sleeping.
6363280	6364280	I have weird dreams.
6364280	6365280	And they're loud.
6365280	6367280	Like, I feel like it's loud.
6367280	6370280	The sounds are loud.
6370280	6373280	Now I've been given an Etch A Sketch for Christmas.
6373280	6376280	And you draw the image of Allah.
6376280	6377280	I'm drawing.
6377280	6381280	I'm figuring out that through the lines,
6381280	6385280	you can see a weird metallic thing underneath it.
6385280	6390280	So I'm scraping the entire Etch A Sketch methodically
6390280	6392280	so I can see what's underneath it.
6392280	6397280	And it's just two armatures and a bullet-shaped metal thing.
6397280	6401280	And it's disturbing because it's coated in graphite.
6401280	6404280	And it's disturbing.
6404280	6406280	It feels like pornography.
6406280	6413280	It feels like the world has been controlled by robots.
6413280	6414280	Now dad's home.
6414280	6416280	It's 9.30.
6416280	6417280	Oh, fuck.
6417280	6419280	Shit just got real.
6419280	6420280	And he's not.
6420280	6422280	He's fucking.
6422280	6424280	He's going through shit of his own.
6424280	6429280	Because he's basically me, but 28.
6429280	6430280	Let's be real.
6430280	6432280	28?
6432280	6435280	And his job is to take customers out.
6435280	6437280	Fucking, you know.
6437280	6440280	This guy's a parrot on his shoulder right now.
6440280	6442280	Now he's coming home and his mom's like,
6442280	6444280	well, the children are terrible.
6444280	6448280	He's like, hold on.
6448280	6450280	I'm rolling.
6450280	6452280	He's like, what do you want me to do?
6452280	6455280	She's like, I want you to be a father.
6455280	6457280	Oh, OK.
6457280	6458280	Is this being a father?
6458280	6463280	All right, he's taking off his belt.
6463280	6466280	OK, he's being sarcastic, but the kids don't know.
6466280	6468280	The kids don't know what sarcasm is.
6468280	6470280	Dan, what's your reflex save?
6470280	6473280	I can't save versus it.
6473280	6475280	Because the kids don't know.
6475280	6476280	They just know.
6476280	6479280	They just feel like they did something wrong.
6479280	6480280	They did something wrong.
6480280	6484280	So the dad's going, OK, this is what you want me to do.
6484280	6485280	All right.
6485280	6487280	He successfully has beaten the children.
6488280	6490280	Are there still spiders on those?
6490280	6491280	There's spiders everywhere.
6491280	6493280	There's spiders on everything.
6493280	6495280	I cast Ed Harmon town.
6495280	6498280	Thank you for coming, everybody.
6498280	6501280	Wait a minute.
6501280	6502280	There is a God.
6502280	6504280	And more to do.
6504280	6506280	There is a God.
6506280	6508280	Matt Gorley.
6508280	6511280	Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, Camille Nantiani.
6511280	6514280	I'm Jeff Davis.
6515280	6518280	Oh, worship Dan Harmon.
6518280	6521280	Next week, we start in this new religion.
6521280	6524280	We're going to start in this new religion, right, Jeff?
6524280	6525280	Oh, yeah.
6525280	6528280	I think you laid down the basic tenets of it already.
6528280	6530280	We get the groundwork laid.
6530280	6532280	If anyone wants to keep role playing,
6532280	6534280	I'm going to be here all night.
6537280	6540280	Did you have a stroke during this show?
6540280	6543280	It wasn't a bad show, though, right?
6544280	6546280	It was a good show.
6546280	6549280	Roll a D20 and find out how good the show is.
6549280	6550280	I'd be honest.
6550280	6553280	It was a 5 out of 20.
6553280	6554280	It was a good show, though, right?
6554280	6555280	I thought so, yeah.
6555280	6556280	Oh, yeah.
6556280	6557280	You're a good person.
6557280	6558280	You're a good person.
6558280	6561280	We got drunk and high, and we went to the Red Fair.
6561280	6563280	You're good for coming here.
6563280	6564280	$10.
6564280	6565280	What are you going to do?
6565280	6567280	Good night.
6567280	6572280	You could play three free-view games on the App Store.
6573280	6576280	You spend it more than that.
6576280	6579280	Also, if the star is close, you're going to have to exit out the back door,
6579280	6581280	if you will, please.
6581280	6584280	Oh, where was the fella?
6584280	6585280	Whose dice are these?
6585280	6586280	Dwayne?
6586280	6589280	Dylan, thanks for the dice, Dylan.
6589280	6593280	Congratulations, Luke, and Hailey, was it?
6593280	6594280	Yes.
6594280	6598280	Congratulations, Luke and Hailey, on your prom-posal.
6599280	6601280	Thank you.
6604280	6605280	Is that yours?
6605280	6606280	Yes.
