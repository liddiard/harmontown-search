0	6000	What did I say?
6000	12000	From Seattle, Washington!
12000	17000	The home of the greatest football team in the world.
17000	19000	The Seattle fuck phases.
19000	21000	What do they call it?
21000	27000	It's Hylin' Down!
27000	31000	I'm your comptroller, the ugly Jeff Davis.
31000	35000	But aren't we all, really, who's a fuckin' guy?
35000	37000	Just give us a little bit, you know?
37000	40000	It's like your teacher says, do you have enough for everybody?
40000	43000	Fuckin' Jeff, that has to be like the most handsome guy around?
43000	44000	Fuck him!
44000	45000	I'm so fuckin'...
45000	50000	Although if you really look closely, when he smiles you see a lot of his gums.
50000	51000	That's like...
51000	53000	It's kinda gross.
53000	55000	Fuck that guy.
55000	58000	I'm only saying that because he's listening right now, intently.
58000	61000	Uh, and, um...
61000	64000	Oh, and here's the mayor?
64000	65000	Yeah!
65000	67000	Of Harman Town?
67000	68000	Yeah!
68000	71000	Yeah!
80000	82000	Yeah!
82000	83000	Whoo!
83000	85000	Thank you.
85000	86000	I wonder if I...
86000	89000	I hadn't really put any thought into what I should do.
89000	92000	Guest comptroller, Dino Stamatopoulos, everybody.
92000	95000	Whoo!
95000	99000	I prefer the ugly Jeff Davis.
99000	100000	Give me one second.
100000	101000	One second.
101000	102000	I'll just fill.
102000	103000	I'll just fill.
103000	104000	Uh, yeah!
104000	106000	I won't use the mic stand.
106000	107000	Uh, I had filler.
107000	108000	I hadn't thought about it.
108000	109000	I don't know.
109000	110000	I didn't know I had a comfort zone.
110000	111000	All right.
111000	112000	I'll just sit in a chair.
112000	113000	It's fine.
113000	114000	How you doing?
114000	115000	I'm doing good.
115000	116000	Is this how it goes?
116000	118000	Like, I'm like Ed McMahon or what?
118000	119000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
119000	120000	This is what you do.
120000	121000	Okay.
121000	123000	From here on out, do whatever you would do.
123000	124000	Like...
124000	125000	Interrupt you and...
125000	126000	Yeah, absolutely.
126000	127000	Whatever you want.
127000	129000	Or if I'm talking for 20 minutes, you're doing fine, too.
129000	131000	That probably means, like, it's going great.
131000	132000	Can I go take a sh...
132000	133000	Not to be presumptuous.
133000	135000	I want to take a shit right now.
135000	136000	Like, on stage?
136000	137000	No!
137000	139000	You want to leave and take a shit?
139000	141000	No, I'm the ugly Jeff Davis.
141000	145000	I do it in private.
145000	149000	If you know how Jeff loves the shit in front of the girls.
149000	152000	Because he's beautiful.
152000	156000	I came back from introducing the movie.
156000	158000	And I went back to the hotel where Dina was drinking.
158000	160000	And I was rejoining him.
160000	161000	And he said, how did it go?
161000	164000	And I said, man, it's a hot crowd.
164000	165000	Seattle's a hot crowd.
165000	167000	Like, you guys are very...
167000	170000	You were very enthusiastic when I introduced the movie.
170000	173000	Dina said, a hot crowd.
173000	174000	Of course they're hot.
174000	177000	You thought you'd get walk-ins?
177000	179000	Yeah, is there like a bum coming in?
179000	182000	It's warm in here, isn't it?
182000	184000	Of course it's a hot crowd.
184000	186000	What's on the fucking screen?
186000	190000	Is that me?
190000	191000	It's a hot crowd.
191000	194000	Yeah, it's a preheated crowd.
194000	197000	I mean, they've endured a lot just to get here.
197000	200000	You're watching a movie about Jesus Christ.
200000	201000	About Jesus Christ.
201000	205000	Not a Freudian slip, people.
205000	206000	All right.
206000	210000	So, life hack section.
210000	214000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
214000	219000	Jeff would play a song.
219000	222000	While he's shitting in his pants.
222000	223000	Sorry, that's all I got.
223000	224000	So I came up with a new...
224000	225000	This happened on accident.
225000	227000	I'm working very hard.
227000	230000	And not as hard as a guy in a loading dock.
230000	232000	But I've been working hard.
232000	235000	And I also had to come to Seattle.
235000	236000	And I came home.
236000	238000	And the flight was early in the morning.
238000	240000	And I fell asleep early.
240000	241000	And I got up.
241000	242000	And I was ready to go.
242000	243000	You know why?
243000	246000	Because the thing I found out, sleep in your pants.
246000	247000	I know.
247000	248000	It's actually brilliant.
248000	249000	Sleep in your pants.
249000	253000	I was so excited when I woke up because I sat up in bed.
254000	255000	Yeah.
255000	257000	And Erin had gotten McDonald's.
257000	259000	There was a McDonald's bag on the foot of the bed.
259000	260000	She...
260000	262000	We were packed and ready to go.
262000	263000	And I was so excited.
263000	265000	It was like, oh, I figured it out.
265000	266000	Yeah.
266000	267000	Yeah.
267000	268000	Sleep in your pants.
268000	270000	And she was kind of put off by it.
270000	272000	Because she wanted me to understand.
272000	276000	Do you understand that that's not a trick?
276000	278000	Not to make it a theme show.
278000	282000	But wait till you learn about adult diapers.
283000	284000	Mwah!
285000	286000	I really thought...
286000	288000	I know that it's possible to sleep in your pants.
288000	290000	And I know I've done it before an accident.
290000	291000	But I kind of...
291000	294000	Like, I made a conscious decision to do it when I came home from work.
294000	297000	It was like, I got to get up at like 5, 6 a.m.
297000	298000	Get on a plane.
298000	299000	Slept in my pants.
299000	301000	There are blankets for your legs.
301000	304000	So you don't need to even...
304000	306000	Like, you can just lay...
306000	310000	Just laying in your pants on a bed.
311000	313000	You don't need a blanket.
313000	314000	Blankets?
314000	316000	You're all wearing blankets right now.
316000	319000	The reason you put a blanket over you when you go home.
319000	321000	I don't have to explain this to you.
322000	323000	You've chosen this life.
323000	325000	I've hacked it.
329000	332000	Aaron, my fianc√©.
335000	338000	Embarrassing things about Aaron's segment.
339000	341000	Wait, how long do we have?
344000	349000	There was a documentary about these 9-11 people.
349000	351000	Who are 9-11 people, Dan?
351000	352000	Who are 9-11 people?
352000	355000	They're like this high and running around.
358000	361000	It was a more adorable national tragedy than you might think.
361000	365000	It was engineered by a tiny group of people.
365000	368000	They lived to make 9-11s.
368000	374000	It was a documentary about the company that was on the upper floors.
374000	375000	There was a specific company.
375000	382000	There was a documentary about the effects of 9-11 on that company.
382000	390000	So in the description, it's trying to make it clear how badly impacted this company was.
390000	392000	So you're watching a documentary about...
392000	395000	Yes, in a world where 9-11 was bad for everyone.
395000	400000	This is a documentary about this company, this investment firm.
400000	402000	Goodbye, laughter.
404000	409000	And so the description says, on whatever morning, whatever,
409000	416000	CEO so-and-so finds out that 750 of his employees are gone.
416000	418000	Something like that.
419000	421000	We watched the whole movie.
421000	423000	And Erin's kind of in silence.
423000	424000	I watched the whole thing.
424000	425000	It's riveting.
425000	426000	It's interesting.
426000	428000	Personal inside.
428000	429000	Sorry.
429000	433000	A couple days later, actually it was today.
433000	436000	Erin said she made this clear before.
436000	439000	I was really disappointed in that documentary.
439000	441000	Yeah, why?
441000	443000	To me, it was kind of boring because it was like,
443000	445000	what does your company do after 9-11?
445000	446000	Yeah, it's hard.
447000	449000	So we're a couple.
449000	452000	We're intimately sharing these opinions about this movie.
452000	457000	And Erin goes, yeah, I thought it was going to be like a mystery.
459000	464000	Because it said 750 people disappeared.
465000	467000	She thought the documentary...
467000	470000	Because we've seen documentaries about people that are like,
470000	473000	oh, she pretended she was in 9-11 and she wasn't.
473000	475000	Whoa, it's a documentary about...
475000	477000	Whoa, she's a pathological liar.
477000	480000	She thought this was a documentary about a group of people
480000	482000	who maybe went out on a picnic.
482000	485000	And the ending may surprise you.
485000	486000	We found them.
486000	488000	Yeah, we're here.
488000	490000	Where are they now?
490000	492000	We were playing Frisbee.
492000	494000	Life is weird.
494000	496000	That's what she... I don't know.
496000	499000	It doesn't suffer retelling very well.
499000	500000	Seattle.
500000	502000	Oh, Seattle.
502000	504000	That fucking place.
504000	507000	I actually think this is the first time I've ever been in Seattle.
507000	512000	And I got off the plane and on the airport floor they have fish
512000	514000	and eel and stuff.
514000	515000	And a trail.
515000	517000	Like goldfish.
517000	519000	Is it in water?
519000	521000	No, it's just pavement.
521000	522000	Oh, pavement.
522000	525000	It's goldfish embedded into the...
525000	526000	Oh, wait.
526000	529000	If you're looking down, you're just seeing fish in a trail
529000	531000	leading you to the baggage carousel.
531000	532000	No, no.
532000	534000	As they would for Ariel.
534000	536000	No, I was... I keep looking at...
536000	539000	You've got to get that suitcase.
539000	543000	Aren't you always looking for, you know, baggage area this way and shit?
543000	544000	Right.
544000	547000	No, I was looking at the floor and there's this goldfish and like...
547000	549000	It's because Erin's holding her hand.
549000	552000	Crawdad and sea snakes and things.
552000	555000	And then I was like, oh, Seattle.
555000	557000	I just got that.
557000	558000	No.
558000	560000	I just got it today.
560000	561000	I swear to God.
561000	563000	I'm so sorry.
563000	566000	It's not like you guys are famous for scuba diving.
566000	568000	You're famous for Eddie Vedder.
568000	571000	I never ever entered my head.
571000	572000	Sea.
572000	574000	It's a port city.
574000	579000	So at the Portland airport, it's just like wooden planks and...
579000	581000	I got Portland.
581000	582000	Portland.
582000	584000	Sea land I probably would have gotten.
584000	587000	It's the Attle part that fucks you.
588000	591000	No one knows what you're talking about.
591000	592000	Seattle.
592000	594000	It just sounds like the name of a city.
594000	595000	It doesn't...
595000	598000	You don't break it down until you see the fish.
598000	599000	Yeah.
599000	600000	Seattle.
600000	603000	I didn't know that the Beatles was spelled that way because of beat.
603000	604000	Beat.
604000	607000	It's just they misspelled Beatles because they wanted to be fun like the monkeys.
607000	608000	Right.
608000	609000	Rock and roll.
609000	610000	Yeah.
610000	611000	Yeah, monkeys doesn't spell it right.
611000	612000	Yeah.
612000	613000	Yeah.
613000	615000	Why should the Beatles if the monkeys do it?
615000	617000	They came first.
619000	620000	All right.
620000	623000	Life hacks sleeping in your pants.
623000	626000	Bam, bam, bam, bam, down, down, down.
626000	629000	I noticed a...
629000	632000	Is that what Jeff Davis does?
632000	634000	I noticed there was a mirror position.
634000	638000	Sometimes this happens to you while you're drinking and it doesn't happen to me all the time.
638000	639000	The bars I prefer.
639000	641000	They don't usually have mirrors behind the bar.
641000	642000	Oh, right.
643000	648000	I find myself looking at the mirror a lot while I'm drinking.
648000	651000	There's a reflection of me behind the bar.
651000	652000	Right.
652000	655000	And I do find myself very distracted by my reflection.
655000	658000	And then equally distracted by the fact that I'm engaged in...
658000	659000	Sorry.
661000	664000	I'm engaged in a socially unacceptable behavior,
664000	667000	which is I'm staring at myself in the mirror while I'm drinking in a bar.
667000	668000	Right.
668000	671000	But I can't get a hold on you because you don't like the way you look.
671000	674000	You'll sign pictures of yourself and just write,
674000	675000	I never looked worse.
675000	677000	Go fuck yourself.
677000	678000	But I would like...
678000	681000	You know how you run your tongue over a tooth wound?
681000	682000	Yeah, yes.
682000	684000	Yes, I do.
684000	685000	It hurts.
685000	687000	I'm doing it now.
687000	689000	It hurts, but it feels good.
689000	690000	I don't know.
690000	691000	You're fascinated with it.
691000	693000	Your tongue goes to the hole.
693000	695000	But now you're like, you want more mirrors in your house.
695000	697000	And I was looking and I was like,
697000	699000	while I was sitting in the back room of this hotel
699000	701000	and I'm drinking, it's just...
701000	703000	All pretense was off.
703000	705000	It wasn't a mirror behind a bar.
705000	707000	It was like, and I don't have a lot of mirrors in my house
707000	709000	and I just realized this.
709000	713000	But I was just sitting there and my initial instinct was,
713000	715000	I've got to move after 10 minutes.
715000	716000	I'm not paying attention to anything.
716000	719000	I'm just staring at myself, drinking in the mirror.
719000	721000	And so I moved three feet.
721000	724000	I was three inches over on the sofa so that I wasn't in the mirror anymore.
724000	726000	And then there was other thing, other people came in
726000	727000	and I was back in front of the mirror.
727000	731000	And then I said to Aaron, we should have more mirrors in our house.
731000	734000	Because I don't know the limit on this.
734000	735000	I love Minecraft.
735000	737000	I didn't know until I played it.
737000	739000	I would just want to sit and drink in front of a mirror
739000	741000	and know when it would stop.
741000	745000	When I would stop being like, maybe that's my favorite thing to do.
745000	747000	Yeah, well, also you don't move around a lot.
747000	750000	I've never seen you move more than with that mirror.
750000	751000	Yeah.
751000	752000	You're getting your exercise.
752000	753000	Because suddenly it was like a thing.
753000	756000	It was like demanding my attention, which is weird.
756000	758000	Another person could just ignore it.
758000	760000	I think this needs to be investigated.
760000	761000	Yeah.
761000	762000	I want any more mirrors in my house.
762000	766000	Then Dustin, our podcast producer's girlfriend, Elizabeth,
766000	769000	I hope this doesn't get her in trouble.
769000	774000	She said that her mom said that Kiefer Sutherland is afraid of mirrors.
774000	776000	Right.
776000	778000	Oh, was her mom Kiefer Sutherland's assistant?
778000	779000	No.
779000	781000	She's just a lady.
781000	785000	She read it on a Honduran website or something.
785000	789000	We were trying to get more information about it, but it was just an urban legend
789000	792000	that Kiefer Sutherland doesn't like mirrors.
792000	793000	Right.
793000	795000	I mean, it's just somebody that took Las Vegas really seriously.
795000	796000	It's just he's getting old.
796000	798000	No one old likes mirrors.
798000	799000	I hate them.
799000	801000	I'm dying.
801000	803000	Look at me.
803000	806000	I like looking at how disgusting I am.
806000	809000	I like watching my face melt.
809000	812000	I like watching your face melt, too.
812000	813000	Thank you.
813000	815000	That must have been hard for you to say.
815000	816000	Ow.
816000	817000	I just hit my nose.
817000	819000	I'm a microphone.
819000	822000	Look, I'm just talking about whatever happens.
822000	824000	This is what Hermann tells about, right?
824000	825000	How do you do this?
825000	826000	Am I doing it right?
826000	827000	Yeah, you're doing great.
827000	828000	Okay.
828000	829000	All right.
829000	833000	So we have some special Seattleites.
833000	835000	Is that what they call themselves?
835000	836000	Yes.
836000	837000	For real?
837000	838000	Yeah.
838000	839000	Yeah.
839000	840000	Seems like a bit.
840000	841000	Seattleites?
841000	842000	Yeah.
842000	843000	Oh, boy.
843000	846000	That's cool.
846000	852000	I mean, because why be a Refusenik?
852000	857000	No, but we have some special guests there.
857000	859000	I mean, you know, we do.
859000	860000	I didn't know that.
860000	862000	I paused and someone said, yeah.
862000	863000	Yeah.
863000	868000	For instance, we have there's an 18-year-old birthday girl here.
868000	869000	There is?
870000	873000	I don't know why people are squealing because she came by herself.
873000	875000	That was part of the story.
875000	877000	Where's our 18-year-old birthday girl?
877000	880000	Are you embarrassed by being singled out?
880000	883000	Kind of, but it's okay at the same time.
883000	884000	Okay.
884000	887000	Do you want to come up and share your birthday with us?
887000	888000	Sure.
888000	889000	Okay.
889000	899000	If you're, I think probably sit there.
899000	901000	That's probably a good one.
901000	902000	What's your name?
902000	903000	My name's Kaylene.
903000	904000	Kaylene.
904000	907000	You can take the mic and take control.
907000	910000	Kaylene, what's the age of consent here in Washington?
910000	911000	Okay.
911000	915000	So I knew this would happen because 18 is the age of consent.
915000	917000	I'm like, someone's going to make a joke about it.
917000	918000	I'm Starburns.
919000	920000	I'm glad it happened early.
920000	921000	I'm glad it happened early.
921000	923000	No, I'm 41 and I'm getting married.
923000	925000	I consider you a daughter figure.
925000	927000	I'm going to take care of you.
927000	930000	I'm bummed out your friends and family aren't here,
930000	933000	but I think it's wonderful that you chose to spend your birthday with us,
933000	936000	where you will be safe and nurtured and respected.
939000	942000	And you can vote now.
942000	943000	Room two.
943000	945000	And it means nothing.
945000	947000	Your vote means nothing.
948000	950000	Room two 18.
950000	952000	What's the hotel call?
952000	953000	Ah, come on.
953000	955000	It's a joke, you fucking cunts.
957000	961000	See, actually the reason I'm alone is that I would invite my mom,
961000	962000	like we're really close,
962000	965000	but I knew she would be offended and exhibit one.
966000	967000	Come on.
967000	970000	If I was really hitting on you, would I do it in front of a...
970000	971000	Yeah, actually I would.
973000	975000	That's the safest way to do it.
975000	976000	That's actually what I said too.
976000	979000	I tweeted Neil Berkley because he was asking for pictures from everyone
979000	980000	on Twitter.
980000	983000	So I was like, yeah, here's my mom in line with me before she leaves
983000	984000	because she can't come in.
984000	985000	Right.
986000	989000	But she dropped you off here and she trusts us with you,
989000	991000	which is important to note.
994000	996000	History is being made here tonight.
996000	999000	Sometimes kids tweet me.
999000	1001000	There was a kid that tweeted me and said,
1001000	1003000	I'm 16, can I get into the show by myself?
1003000	1005000	I don't suppose that kid's here, are you?
1005000	1006000	I don't think you're supposed to be.
1007000	1010000	And I don't tweet him back because what I would tweet...
1010000	1013000	I feel like a funny duddy, but I'm like, well, no, you're...
1015000	1016000	You shouldn't be...
1016000	1017000	You can't come.
1017000	1018000	You shouldn't come.
1019000	1020000	I actually...
1020000	1022000	Not because I'm a prude or anything,
1022000	1024000	and I mean all kinds of parents who are like,
1024000	1028000	oh, yeah, my kid's 10 years old and he's seen it all, whatever.
1028000	1029000	I'm fine with that.
1029000	1030000	I don't care.
1030000	1031000	Just Dino's gonna be here.
1032000	1036000	But when a kid says by themself, when they say like,
1036000	1039000	oh, my parents don't know about it, I want to come to the show or whatever,
1039000	1042000	I'm like, well, I can't sign off on that.
1042000	1046000	You got to tell your parents that you're coming to the Rocky Horror Picture Show,
1046000	1047000	which is how I grew up,
1047000	1050000	which is what we were talking about up in the projection booth.
1050000	1052000	I did have my mom listen to one episode.
1052000	1055000	It was the Robin Williams episode because she loves Robin Williams.
1055000	1057000	And she loved that episode.
1057000	1058000	Too soon.
1062000	1063000	She loves that episode.
1063000	1066000	So she got a taste of what I was getting into.
1066000	1068000	And then we're also that kind of family.
1068000	1072000	I'm just telling you things to make you feel at ease of me being at this show.
1072000	1074000	But I got her Cards Against Humanity for Christmas.
1074000	1076000	We're that family.
1076000	1077000	You got a what for Christmas?
1077000	1078000	Cards Against Humanity.
1078000	1079000	Oh, okay, yeah.
1079000	1080000	So your mom's a hack.
1082000	1083000	I'm kidding.
1083000	1084000	I'm just kidding.
1085000	1087000	Why is there a plaza there?
1088000	1092000	It just seems like play apples apples.
1092000	1094000	Bring the guy who's angry about it.
1098000	1100000	I want to talk to him for a while.
1101000	1103000	Well, if that's what you want, I mean, that's no, no, no.
1103000	1104000	Do whatever you want.
1104000	1105000	It's your show.
1105000	1107000	I mean, I've got to agree, though, because I'll talk to you later.
1107000	1109000	I'm going to fuck this shit out of you.
1110000	1111000	Not the guy, right?
1111000	1112000	Oh, yes.
1114000	1115000	Oh, yeah. Sorry.
1115000	1117000	Yeah, this is a TV.
1117000	1118000	I'm looking right at him.
1120000	1121000	Yes.
1121000	1124000	Well, if your parents listen to this, this is what I would say to them.
1124000	1127000	Thank you for entrusting us with what's your name?
1127000	1128000	Kaylee.
1128000	1129000	Kaylee.
1129000	1130000	Thank you for entrusting us.
1130000	1131000	It's in my phone.
1131000	1132000	Don't worry.
1134000	1135000	It's the worst.
1135000	1136000	It's the worst.
1136000	1137000	I know it's long.
1137000	1139000	It's low hanging fruit, but I love it.
1139000	1141000	They're not going to listen to this now.
1141000	1142000	Okay.
1142000	1143000	All right.
1143000	1144000	Good.
1144000	1145000	Anyway, probably.
1145000	1148000	My mom let me watch all kinds of horrible things and listen to horrible things.
1148000	1149000	But she was involved.
1149000	1152000	You know, I was able to have a dialogue with her.
1152000	1158000	I feel like an old Fuddy Duddy, but I imagine having kids in this age and I hear parents
1158000	1159000	talking about it.
1159000	1163000	It's like I walked in and my kid was in front of YouTube and he's eight years old.
1163000	1164000	It's like YouTube alone.
1164000	1167000	You could like type anything in and you could be looking at it.
1167000	1169000	And what are you supposed to do as a parent?
1169000	1170000	What's your rule?
1170000	1171000	I'm a parent.
1171000	1172000	Why do you think I fucking drink?
1172000	1173000	It's a nightmare.
1174000	1180000	Is your parent going to be that you're going to be the bottleneck between all of reality,
1180000	1184000	which used to be relegated to one box in the living room that could be controlled, could
1184000	1192000	be turned on and off, kind of, and is now an aerosol mist of nano robotic fucking like
1192000	1194000	just donkey fucking.
1194000	1197000	It's just like it's on all of us.
1197000	1201000	When you're born now, they put a barcode on your ass and they put you on a stainless steel
1201000	1206000	scale and you're watching already somebody getting fucked on YouTube.
1206000	1210000	It's playing in the corner of the room when you get your vaccinations.
1210000	1214000	I wish I could say you took the words right out of my mouth, but I can't.
1214000	1216000	So what do you do as a parent?
1216000	1219000	Because we punish theocracy.
1219000	1221000	We punish family values.
1221000	1225000	We associate that with Republicans and we go like, oh, you're a Fuddy Duddy.
1225000	1229000	What are you going to learn that I can have a tattoo and I can have my dick pierced and
1229000	1233000	I should have blue hair and I should be whatever I want to be.
1233000	1235000	That's all very wonderful.
1235000	1238000	It's like, no, but what do you really actually do?
1238000	1244000	You see in Seattle, you see the guys walking with the flannel shirts and they look like
1244000	1249000	Ryan Gosling and they got a beautiful toe-haired kid behind him and the kid stumbles and the
1249000	1252000	dad turns around and goes, you okay, bro?
1252000	1255000	I just saw that today happen.
1256000	1259000	No, I'm not making that.
1259000	1261000	And that's how we think.
1261000	1262000	Okay, let's do that.
1262000	1264000	Yes, let's do that for sure.
1264000	1267000	In the good moments, that seems like a really cool thing.
1267000	1268000	You okay, bro?
1268000	1271000	Yeah, I've got like bananas and lasers.
1271000	1272000	Cool, bro.
1272000	1274000	Cool, bro.
1274000	1277000	I mean, family is darkness.
1277000	1282000	Family, if it's a real family, it's a box you're drawing around all of the shit.
1282000	1286000	It's not just the moments with the parkers and the stumbling.
1286000	1290000	There's going to be darkness contained in that box.
1290000	1295000	We do tell parents, number one, you have to have a job, both of you.
1295000	1300000	Number two, your kid better have a job when he's 18 because we're running a fucking ant
1300000	1301000	colony here.
1301000	1303000	Number three, fuck daycare.
1303000	1308000	Your kid that needs to have a job in 18 years and you and your wife have to both have a
1308000	1309000	job.
1309000	1314000	Also, you can't take care of them and go to work.
1314000	1318000	You better hire someone whose job is to take care of your kid.
1318000	1321000	We tell everybody all this stuff with the way the system works, but nothing that we're
1321000	1322000	telling anybody.
1322000	1324000	It's like, what do you do?
1324000	1330000	This adorable girl with her braces and she's in Harman Town and has a big sweaty lump of
1330000	1335000	shit talking about fucking and sucking.
1335000	1339000	Your mom dropped you off and she's hoping for the best.
1339000	1345000	You'll probably be a senator, but I don't know what to tell you.
1345000	1351000	I'm sitting here, I'm listening to you and I A, either want to be your child, B, want
1351000	1357000	to marry you, or C, probably this is the easiest one, just fuck you.
1357000	1360000	My kids are going to be all that more messed up because I'm going to come sit on their
1360000	1364000	bed and go, hey, your mom said you were watching YouTube today.
1364000	1368000	Heard you Googled the pickle lady.
1368000	1372000	You know, the pickle lady's not like regular ladies.
1372000	1374000	She's special.
1374000	1375000	I don't know.
1375000	1376000	What are you going to say?
1376000	1378000	How do you explain this shit?
1378000	1381000	How do you explain anything?
1381000	1383000	None of it makes any sense.
1383000	1386000	There's so many cultural tripwires, too.
1386000	1393000	Do I explain to my kid that the word watermelon has energy behind it, that carrot doesn't?
1394000	1398000	Or at what point am I creating something?
1398000	1400000	Because my parents did that to me.
1400000	1405000	I was raised in the 70s and my parents, my mom, I was playing with two Sesame Street
1405000	1411000	figures, Gordon and Mr. Hooper, and my mom said, are you enjoying playing with them?
1411000	1412000	Yes, I am.
1412000	1416000	Do you notice a difference between them?
1416000	1420000	One owns the newspaper store.
1420000	1424000	Do you notice anything else different about them?
1424000	1426000	I don't know.
1426000	1430000	Good.
1430000	1431000	That's good.
1431000	1435000	Because the difference is one's black and one's white, and you should never notice that
1435000	1437000	for the rest of your life.
1437000	1442000	She just opened the panel and was like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
1442000	1445000	And now I'm 41, and I'm a black person sitting in the front room.
1445000	1449000	I'm like, I hope the black person likes the show because they're black, black, black, black,
1449000	1451000	black, black, black.
1451000	1453000	Because I'm not racist.
1453000	1455000	I'm so not racist.
1455000	1459000	Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black.
1459000	1462000	All right, Dan, your time is up.
1462000	1466000	Kayleen, you now have 20 minutes to respond.
1466000	1470000	You are now 19.
1470000	1472000	The debate is on.
1472000	1475000	What do you kids think about race?
1476000	1478000	I'm sorry.
1478000	1481000	That's not a fair question for anybody.
1481000	1483000	Your 18th birthday.
1483000	1485000	I am so sorry.
1485000	1486000	Forget I said anything.
1486000	1487000	It's an open mic.
1487000	1488000	Just talk.
1488000	1490000	Back to family.
1495000	1498000	My mom always, because kids inherently ask questions.
1498000	1500000	That's what they do.
1500000	1504000	So your mom thrusts the question onto you, but what my mom did was she just opened the
1505000	1506000	floor.
1506000	1507000	We could ask her questions.
1507000	1509000	She'd decide if it's time or not time.
1509000	1511000	And if we pressed her, she'd just tell us.
1511000	1513000	And that's why I'm scarred for life.
1513000	1520000	But she was like, if we asked her a question, she'd be as honest as she could.
1520000	1523000	And I think it worked out.
1523000	1524000	That's all you need.
1524000	1530000	I think that's probably it because I can see the vodka spraying off my mustache hairs.
1531000	1535000	I think that's probably it because there was an Internet when I was a kid, as I've described
1535000	1538000	in the show, which was called the creek where we would hunt craydad in.
1538000	1540000	And crawdad?
1540000	1541000	Crayfish?
1541000	1542000	Crawdad, yeah.
1542000	1546000	And there were Hustler magazine pages that would float over the railroad tracks and we
1546000	1547000	would rub the mud off of them.
1547000	1551000	That's basically YouTubing something.
1551000	1554000	It's an unhealthy way for a kid to discover the world.
1554000	1559000	And the big difference is if you're able to go to your parents and say, hey, I saw
1559000	1573000	that Charlie at school today said that girls have a hole where their wiener's supposed
1573000	1574000	to be.
1574000	1576000	What's your take on that?
1576000	1580000	And your parents should just field the question like the White House press correspondent,
1580000	1581000	right?
1581000	1585000	They're like, oh, we are still actively exploring that.
1585000	1589000	It appears to have something to do with how you were created.
1589000	1593000	However, it's not an important thing socially.
1593000	1599000	There's an X and a Y chromosome.
1599000	1605000	So the words by yourself are depressing socially, but you are here by yourself.
1605000	1606000	Yeah.
1606000	1607000	Because your friends hate Harmentown.
1608000	1611000	No, I tried to get them involved, but they're busy.
1611000	1613000	So they never.
1613000	1615000	I kept sending them links.
1615000	1617000	I made it really easy.
1617000	1618000	I made it extremely easy.
1618000	1621000	I sent them links to episodes I think they would like.
1621000	1625000	The millennial generation, they're in their Gmail box.
1625000	1628000	They're getting invitations.
1628000	1630000	They will not attend.
1630000	1635000	I'd love to attend a nerd fest on a Saturday night.
1636000	1641000	So yeah, you were like, this sweaty old man is important to me.
1641000	1644000	I don't know why.
1644000	1647000	And then all your friends were like, we respect that.
1647000	1649000	And we respect you.
1649000	1651000	But we are choosing different paths.
1651000	1655000	I, for instance, plan on hunting vampires.
1655000	1657000	There are a lot of things to do in high school.
1657000	1659000	This is not one of them.
1659000	1660000	That's good.
1660000	1662000	It makes you feel more genuine.
1662000	1666000	If you're here with a group of friends, we'd be like, fuck youth.
1666000	1670000	Yeah, well, I'd just be worried about what they were thinking.
1670000	1673000	You play a song for a friend and you're like, I hope they like it.
1673000	1675000	You can't even listen to the song.
1675000	1678000	You're just looking at their face like, how do you feel?
1678000	1685000	When I was 12, I made all my friends see space balls.
1688000	1690000	I dragged them into the theater.
1690000	1692000	They were like, no, Beverly Hills Cop 2.
1692000	1696000	I was like, no, space balls for suresies.
1696000	1698000	Here's why.
1698000	1700000	This guy did Young Frankenstein.
1700000	1701000	He did Blazing Saddles.
1701000	1703000	And it's Star Wars.
1703000	1705000	Slam dunk.
1705000	1707000	Come with me, gentlemen.
1707000	1709000	Come with me.
1709000	1711000	And then it was cut to us walking out.
1711000	1715000	And Steve Ruel was like, why was the guy a cat?
1715000	1721000	Because it wasn't a good Star Wars parody.
1721000	1724000	I'm so happy that you didn't like it when you saw it.
1724000	1726000	I'm 10 years older than you.
1726000	1728000	And I'm like, fuck this.
1728000	1732000	They had a joke where it's like, Sergeant Asshole, there's Lieutenant Asshole.
1732000	1734000	I'm surrounded by assholes.
1734000	1736000	That movie is filled with that.
1736000	1737000	That's every joke.
1737000	1740000	And someone goes like, I'm Richard Chair.
1740000	1743000	I'm going to sit on you.
1743000	1744000	What?
1744000	1745000	It's just not a joke.
1745000	1747000	That's like a joke for a child.
1747000	1749000	It doesn't even make sense.
1749000	1752000	You know what my first joke I ever told when I was a kid was?
1752000	1754000	Kaylee?
1754000	1755000	Is that right?
1755000	1756000	Kaylee?
1756000	1761000	Is it K-A-Y-L-E-I-G-H?
1761000	1765000	You almost said K-A-Y-L-E-N-E.
1765000	1766000	Yeah.
1766000	1768000	N.
1768000	1769000	Kaylene.
1769000	1770000	Kaylene.
1770000	1771000	Oh.
1771000	1772000	Okay.
1772000	1773000	That's weird.
1773000	1774000	It is.
1774000	1777000	It's been mistaken all the time.
1777000	1778000	Kaylene.
1778000	1779000	Kaylene.
1779000	1781000	I can't believe the weirdo called her weird.
1781000	1782000	I know.
1782000	1783000	It doesn't matter.
1783000	1784000	It doesn't matter.
1784000	1785000	Kaylene.
1785000	1786000	Okay.
1786000	1787000	All right.
1787000	1789000	What was I saying?
1789000	1791000	What was the first joke that you told?
1791000	1792000	Okay.
1792000	1793000	I'm glad you asked.
1793000	1799000	That's how he gets them.
1799000	1803000	I'm going to tell you the first joke I ever told anybody.
1803000	1808000	And it's significant because I'm now a comedic master.
1808000	1812000	But I don't actually have a lot of memory of it, but my mom explained it to me that this
1812000	1814000	was my first joke that I would tell over and over again.
1814000	1818000	And I will pronounce the punch line to you the same way I did when I was a kid.
1818000	1819000	Okay.
1819000	1821000	Here's the first joke I ever told.
1821000	1823000	Kaylene?
1823000	1826000	I didn't include that part.
1826000	1830000	What's gray and has four legs and a trunk?
1830000	1831000	What?
1831000	1837000	An elephant, right?
1837000	1839000	I got it.
1839000	1842000	Worst joke ever.
1842000	1846000	A mouse going on vacation.
1846000	1849000	Oh, fuck.
1849000	1850000	You got me.
1850000	1851000	It still kills me.
1851000	1853000	I can't believe it.
1853000	1854000	You got me.
1854000	1856000	It's a fucking massive vacation, bro.
1856000	1858000	You didn't ask how big it was.
1858000	1860000	I thought it was an elephant.
1860000	1862000	You pictured an elephant.
1862000	1863000	It's a massive vacation.
1863000	1865000	I fell right into that one.
1865000	1868000	I got a feeling.
1868000	1870000	Kaylene, let me ask you a question.
1870000	1871000	You're 18.
1871000	1874000	What are you...
1874000	1875000	It's in my phone.
1875000	1876000	Ow.
1876000	1877000	Jesus.
1877000	1880000	I got so excited, I almost smashed my teeth in.
1880000	1882000	It's in my phone.
1882000	1883000	Hold on.
1883000	1886000	I want to look and see if...
1886000	1889000	There's another guy up here that I want you to meet.
1889000	1891000	Not like that.
1891000	1892000	Fuckin' cock blocker.
1892000	1895000	Everyone's on eggshells because you're 18 and it's like...
1895000	1896000	Nobody screwed this up.
1896000	1898000	I don't want you to meet him like that.
1898000	1900000	Are you sending another 18-year-old here?
1900000	1901000	No, no, no, no, no.
1901000	1904000	Because I don't think I could take it in my heart.
1904000	1906000	No, this guy is a guy that came up to me.
1906000	1908000	I don't know if he's willing to come up either,
1908000	1912000	but he came up to me and he said...
1912000	1914000	Hey, I have some cutting boards for you.
1914000	1917000	Oh, my God. Send him up.
1917000	1919000	He said he made some special cutting boards.
1919000	1920000	I love cooking.
1920000	1922000	Is the cutting board guy here?
1922000	1924000	Yeah, there he is.
1924000	1926000	Do you want to come up?
1926000	1929000	We won't. We won't.
1929000	1932000	You're not going to cut up Kaylene, are you?
1932000	1934000	You can just sit and...
1934000	1937000	Because, yeah, I think we'll probably have questions.
1937000	1940000	Okay.
1949000	1951000	Because he's...
1951000	1954000	I mean, I was like, okay, you made cutting boards for us.
1954000	1956000	And he wants to give them to us.
1956000	1958000	And, you know, it's something you do.
1958000	1959000	You're passionate about it.
1959000	1961000	Do I get one, too? Because I'm a cook.
1961000	1962000	You do.
1962000	1963000	Okay, good.
1963000	1966000	So I don't have a lot of creative outlets
1966000	1968000	that I'm, you know, really kind of...
1968000	1970000	Everything's always kind of like making something
1970000	1972000	for a utilitarian purpose.
1972000	1974000	But I kind of found that if I made...
1974000	1976000	Room 218?
1978000	1980000	I found if I made cutting boards,
1980000	1982000	it was something I was really kind of good at.
1982000	1985000	And so I made you and Aaron, and I made Spencer,
1985000	1987000	and I made, you know...
1987000	1988000	Sure.
1988000	1989000	Yeah, I'll take it.
1989000	1990000	All right.
1990000	1991000	So, no, I have a seat.
1991000	1995000	I mean, I have more questions than you'd think about cutting boards.
1995000	1997000	And I don't know if I'll offend you or not,
1997000	1999000	because my first questions are based on, like,
1999000	2002000	isn't a cutting board just a slab of wood?
2002000	2003000	And therefore...
2003000	2004000	Oh, what's your name?
2004000	2005000	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Jeff.
2005000	2006000	Jeff?
2006000	2007000	Yeah.
2007000	2008000	Oh, Jeff.
2009000	2011000	Do you want vodka?
2011000	2012000	Sure.
2012000	2013000	I'll pour you one.
2013000	2015000	Sorry, Katelyn.
2016000	2019000	So, yeah, cutting board could just be a piece of wood.
2019000	2021000	But what I do is I laminate it,
2021000	2024000	so I will, like, contrast the wood.
2024000	2026000	So I use...
2028000	2031000	It's just a master at work.
2031000	2032000	So...
2037000	2038000	Oh, boy.
2038000	2039000	What?
2039000	2040000	He's trying...
2040000	2042000	Even the things that you would normally not get wrong,
2042000	2045000	you had to enforce getting wrong.
2047000	2050000	You had to try so hard to pour vodka wrong.
2052000	2053000	I love attention.
2055000	2057000	So I'll laminate wood.
2057000	2060000	So what I'll do is I'll take a wood of, like,
2060000	2062000	a light-colored wood and then, like,
2062000	2065000	usually a darker-colored wood or a different kind of wood
2065000	2067000	and contrast it so it looks kind of cool.
2067000	2070000	So what does that mean?
2070000	2073000	And please, audience, let me know when you just, like,
2073000	2074000	hate me for the...
2074000	2077000	But honestly, like, sometimes I just, like,
2077000	2079000	I need to understand things.
2079000	2080000	So when you...
2080000	2081000	You're trying to...
2081000	2082000	Lem, can I just interrupt for a second?
2082000	2085000	Dustin, Dustin, you're making editing notes, right?
2085000	2086000	Oh.
2086000	2087000	Okay, good.
2087000	2088000	Well, don't...
2088000	2091000	No, because I intend for this to be the most fascinating thing
2091000	2092000	in the conversation in the world because...
2092000	2094000	So do you mean that, like...
2094000	2096000	Okay, I'm looking at a cutting board in my mind.
2096000	2097000	You want me to show you some?
2097000	2098000	Yeah, yeah, okay.
2098000	2100000	That'd be the best option, Mike.
2100000	2103000	But it is a podcast audience,
2103000	2105000	so I also want them to understand, like,
2105000	2107000	when I picture a cutting board,
2107000	2109000	I'm just picturing it's a piece of wood
2109000	2111000	and it usually has a handle.
2111000	2113000	Yep, that's what it is.
2113000	2115000	Oh, boy.
2115000	2116000	Wait, oh, my God.
2116000	2118000	And here's the new development.
2118000	2121000	This guy really just made some cutting boards for us.
2121000	2124000	They don't say community on them or anything like these.
2124000	2125000	I actually love them.
2125000	2126000	I need a cutting board.
2126000	2128000	This is truly his passion.
2128000	2129000	These are great.
2129000	2131000	They look delicious.
2131000	2135000	So you're saying you took light wood and dark wood,
2135000	2138000	but so they're adhered together with...
2138000	2140000	What, an epoxy or something?
2140000	2144000	Yeah, use a wood glue called Titebond.
2144000	2146000	What happens to that in the dishwasher?
2146000	2148000	I don't recommend putting it in the dishwasher.
2148000	2149000	You don't put it in the dishwasher?
2149000	2150000	You can't put it in the dishwasher!
2150000	2151000	You fucking Bulgarian...
2151000	2153000	You fucking son of a bitch!
2153000	2156000	You piece of shit, you fucking asshole!
2156000	2158000	What the fuck are you doing?
2158000	2160000	I'm yelling at you!
2160000	2161000	Oh.
2161000	2162000	Oh, you're yelling at me?
2162000	2165000	Yeah, you don't put him in the fucking dishwasher, you cocksucker!
2165000	2166000	I was trying strength for me.
2166000	2167000	No!
2167000	2168000	I thought we were getting up on him.
2168000	2169000	No!
2170000	2171000	I don't cook!
2171000	2172000	I don't cook!
2172000	2173000	Yeah, you don't cook!
2173000	2174000	I don't cook.
2174000	2175000	Death is right!
2175000	2177000	Even I knew that, like...
2180000	2182000	All right, okay, all right.
2182000	2185000	All right, well, good job on the cutting board.
2185000	2186000	Thank you.
2186000	2190000	I mean, as long as some psycho doesn't mistreat it.
2190000	2193000	Yeah, you just put some mineral oil when it starts to get dry,
2193000	2195000	and then hand-washing works best.
2195000	2197000	So you don't want your cutting board to be dry.
2197000	2199000	You want to have mineral oil on it.
2199000	2201000	Yeah, well, I mean, you just put enough on there,
2201000	2203000	and then it kind of evaporates, or it sucks up what it needs.
2203000	2207000	And what's the worst-case scenario with a dry cutting board?
2207000	2209000	It's just going to be a little more prone to damage.
2209000	2210000	It's going to take the...
2210000	2214000	Like you could scratch it with your knife that you're cutting on it.
2214000	2216000	But that's also the point, though, too.
2216000	2217000	I'm fucking taking...
2217000	2218000	A little bit.
2218000	2221000	I'm fucking taking your cutting board, Dan.
2221000	2223000	Erin doesn't need it.
2223000	2224000	She bakes.
2224000	2226000	That's all she does.
2226000	2228000	She will...
2228000	2230000	Erin, where are you?
2230000	2232000	You have to cut cakes, though.
2232000	2234000	Oh, yeah.
2234000	2236000	Yeah, but you don't need a board for it.
2236000	2239000	All you need is a plate.
2239000	2240000	I do.
2240000	2241000	I mean...
2241000	2242000	It's not...
2242000	2247000	Unless, you know, Erin's are a little tough.
2247000	2248000	What? It's a podcast.
2248000	2252000	I'm trying to get laughs.
2252000	2255000	All these oohs and ahs.
2255000	2266000	I feel like I'm killing Jews over here.
2266000	2267000	I mean, you...
2267000	2268000	So, do you...
2268000	2271000	Is there a way that people can reward you if they hear...
2271000	2274000	I mean, I don't want to make this into Shark Tank or anything, but...
2274000	2277000	But should we consider these quality cutting boards?
2277000	2281000	Should people be able to find you on Etsy or where are you selling your wares?
2281000	2285000	No, I'm kind of too OCD about when I make stuff for people.
2285000	2287000	I usually only do it for, like, as a gift.
2287000	2289000	You're like the Cormac McCarthy of cutting boards.
2289000	2292000	People have to come find you in the woods.
2292000	2294000	What did you mean by that cutting board?
2294000	2300000	I told you no one but the Cohen brothers.
2300000	2303000	It's just something that I could never...
2303000	2308000	I mean, it's kind of like this anxiety I have that if I make it, like,
2308000	2315000	commercially for somebody that I would just be, like, scared that they're going to find a defect
2315000	2317000	and then I'm going to feel like I didn't do a really good job.
2317000	2318000	Jesus.
2318000	2320000	Yeah, don't be scared. I love them.
2320000	2324000	Well, now I'm going to have to start cooking just to honor your cutting board.
2324000	2325000	Yeah, you really do.
2325000	2327000	Because that means you giving me this is, like, a huge...
2327000	2332000	But if you make it as a gift, it's like there's less pressure because it's a gift, you know?
2332000	2336000	But the flaws in your cutting boards, you should, you know...
2336000	2342000	If you move to L.A. and say, yeah, the flaw is the point.
2342000	2344000	Which flaw are you going to do?
2344000	2349000	I think his point is you make the flaws in my cutting board.
2349000	2351000	Oh.
2351000	2352000	Yeah.
2352000	2354000	It's a cutting board.
2354000	2356000	You choose how much mineral oil goes on at when.
2356000	2357000	Yeah.
2357000	2358000	I'm going to go take a shit break.
2358000	2360000	Do you ever cook, Kaitlyn?
2361000	2362000	Not really.
2362000	2365000	We recently had this thing that, like, they send you the ingredients,
2365000	2369000	and I tried that, and it sucked because of my fault.
2369000	2371000	Who are they?
2371000	2373000	What is a thing?
2373000	2377000	Because this could be a sci-fi movie.
2377000	2381000	It's a company that, like, they measure out all the ingredients.
2381000	2385000	It's like a rich people thing, and someone gifted it to us.
2385000	2386000	So maybe you'd like it.
2386000	2388000	Room 218.
2389000	2390000	I know what you're talking about.
2390000	2391000	Is it to your family, or just to you?
2391000	2392000	Yeah, to our family.
2392000	2393000	Like, it's an easy way to start cooking.
2393000	2395000	Like, if you're in a hurry, you don't have to measure out.
2395000	2396000	It's, like, easy instructions.
2396000	2397000	Oh, my God.
2397000	2401000	So I made these, like, BLT sandwiches,
2401000	2404000	but they were, like, tofu instead of bacon.
2404000	2406000	So I already knew I kind of wouldn't like it,
2406000	2410000	but I tried it just to, like, I don't know, be a better person.
2410000	2412000	I love that someone sent you guys this.
2412000	2417000	Are you guys a family that's sending up, like, red flags for the neighborhood?
2418000	2420000	They're like, we should teach them to cook.
2423000	2427000	The Smiths are, they might pop at any second.
2427000	2428000	Yeah.
2428000	2429000	Like, they're over there.
2429000	2431000	I can hear horses in the backyard,
2431000	2433000	and I don't know if they know how to feed themselves,
2433000	2435000	and I'm worried about the economy.
2435000	2438000	We're going to send them ingredients, and people are...
2438000	2442000	My mom and I just moved to a new, like, little apartment,
2442000	2445000	so it was just, like, a moving gift, like, here's something to...
2445000	2447000	Because my mom works, and then I'm, like, home alone.
2447000	2449000	Are your parents separated?
2449000	2450000	Yeah.
2450000	2453000	So how long are you in Seattle? Do you live here?
2453000	2455000	Both my parents live in Seattle.
2455000	2458000	So, well, suburbs of Seattle.
2458000	2461000	So your dad took the cooking board.
2461000	2463000	Did your dad do all the cooking?
2463000	2466000	Yeah, actually, he owns a restaurant, so, yeah, he did all the cooking.
2466000	2468000	Men are better cooks.
2468000	2471000	And that's not the...
2471000	2473000	Well, because women have to.
2474000	2476000	We just do it for fun.
2476000	2479000	So it's just you and your mom living in an apartment now?
2479000	2482000	Yeah, we kicked my brother out, because he's too old.
2482000	2483000	Does he want to live with dad?
2483000	2485000	Well, because he's a man.
2485000	2487000	Yeah, he's...
2487000	2489000	No balls allowed in the house.
2489000	2491000	I'm sorry.
2491000	2494000	He's getting an apartment with his friends, so...
2494000	2495000	How old is he?
2495000	2496000	19.
2496000	2497000	Yeah, he's out.
2497000	2499000	Wow, you're in a real...
2499000	2501000	I mean, that's a tumultuous situation to be in.
2501000	2504000	That's a late stage of your admittedly...
2504000	2505000	No wonder you're here.
2505000	2507000	You should take one of these.
2507000	2509000	You should definitely take a cutting board.
2509000	2511000	Take his, for God's sake.
2511000	2512000	No, don't take mine.
2512000	2515000	Or Spencer's, what's he going to cut pot on it?
2520000	2521000	But I want to hear more...
2521000	2523000	I'll cut Coke on mine.
2523000	2525000	Hey, by the way, I put out a tweet for Coke.
2525000	2528000	If anyone has any, you can fucking set it up.
2529000	2530000	What?
2531000	2532000	All right.
2532000	2533000	I can't hear.
2533000	2537000	How have you been handling, I mean, is it...
2537000	2539000	Is your mom...
2539000	2544000	At any point you can go, this is not for your podcast consumption.
2544000	2548000	But when I was younger than you, my parents separated for a while.
2548000	2551000	I lived with my mom and my brother lived with my dad.
2551000	2553000	We would go back and forth, but it was like...
2553000	2555000	There was a division in the family and it was just like...
2555000	2557000	Everything was just, oh, okay, this is how it is.
2558000	2560000	And it wasn't like a TV show.
2560000	2564000	It wasn't like I had feelings to begin with that I was going to like flaunt around and go like,
2564000	2566000	well, I just feel like I should feel like this.
2566000	2567000	So I kind of like...
2567000	2571000	This is happening to you and you seem like a put together young lady.
2571000	2574000	You're 18 years old, but you're still young.
2574000	2576000	It's you and your mom in an apartment.
2576000	2577000	Do you...
2577000	2583000	How do you feel about all of this that's happening in your family?
2584000	2587000	I think you misunderstand a little piece of information.
2587000	2589000	They divorced it when I was in fifth grade.
2589000	2590000	So...
2591000	2593000	Now you're drudging up memories.
2595000	2596000	We're not like...
2596000	2598000	This isn't like a really recent thing.
2598000	2602000	It's just like my mom and like my brother and I,
2602000	2605000	we stayed in our home that we grew up in.
2605000	2608000	And then now the mortgage is like too much for my mom.
2608000	2610000	So we moved to an apartment now.
2610000	2612000	So that's the only real big change.
2612000	2614000	This isn't the point of the schism.
2614000	2616000	This is just the point of you and your mom moving in a different place.
2616000	2617000	Yes.
2617000	2619000	So your dad's been out of the picture for a little while.
2619000	2620000	Well, I still see him.
2620000	2621000	Like he's not out of the picture.
2621000	2622000	Sorry, dad.
2623000	2626000	Put some mineral oil on that marriage.
2626000	2629000	I didn't mean to make it seem so sparse and dry.
2630000	2632000	Yeah, well, that's the age I was.
2632000	2634000	I was in fifth grade when the parents like...
2637000	2638000	This is great.
2638000	2640000	You're going to be a great artist.
2641000	2646000	Do you think that parents should stay together for the kids?
2646000	2648000	It's kind of a loaded question, isn't it?
2649000	2652000	But I always have this fascination with this like,
2652000	2654000	when are they supposed to honor us?
2656000	2658000	I think I was also kind of a well-adjusted child.
2658000	2660000	So it didn't really hit me too hard.
2661000	2663000	But I don't know.
2663000	2665000	It didn't really impact my life in a very big manner.
2665000	2667000	Like I still see my dad.
2667000	2669000	We have two Christmases, two Easter.
2669000	2670000	I don't think.
2670000	2671000	You're all fucked up.
2671000	2672000	Trust me.
2672000	2674000	Hey, Kayleen, you had a hard life, things are hard,
2674000	2676000	but you're getting a cutting board out of this.
2676000	2677000	Thanks for coming.
2678000	2679000	You're going to...
2679000	2680000	I mean, maybe.
2680000	2681000	I don't know.
2681000	2682000	We'll see in like 20 years.
2682000	2683000	She'll get a cutting board.
2683000	2685000	No, like three years.
2685000	2686000	Okay.
2686000	2688000	Yeah, it's going to start coming up in your work.
2688000	2689000	There's an actual timer.
2689000	2690000	Yeah.
2690000	2691000	People are going to go like...
2691000	2693000	I mean, it's your first big relationship.
2693000	2695000	Like the guy is going to go...
2695000	2696000	Guy, I'm making presumptions.
2696000	2697000	Oh God, don't make it gross.
2697000	2698000	He's going to go...
2698000	2699000	It's the first time someone says,
2699000	2701000	What's wrong with you?
2701000	2702000	Then you're going to go,
2702000	2703000	What is...
2704000	2705000	Gail?
2706000	2708000	I'm assuming that's your dad's name.
2713000	2714000	And then, I don't know.
2714000	2716000	You know, by the time you're my age,
2716000	2718000	the life expectancy will be 300.
2718000	2719000	And then everyone will be like,
2719000	2721000	How do I learn less?
2722000	2724000	I don't know why I'm talking to you.
2724000	2725000	Because it's your birthday.
2725000	2726000	Happy birthday, Kayleen.
2726000	2727000	Happy birthday!
2727000	2728000	Happy birthday.
2728000	2731000	She's 18.
2731000	2734000	She's become an adult in front of your eyes.
2734000	2736000	Let's give her her first drink.
2736000	2739000	No, that's years from now.
2739000	2740000	Years from now.
2741000	2743000	And probably years ago.
2743000	2746000	But not happening here.
2746000	2748000	I'm actually the goody two shoes in my family.
2748000	2750000	So I don't actually plan on drinking even while I'm 21.
2750000	2752000	You're not going to like this anyways.
2752000	2754000	You picked your role models very well.
2755000	2757000	Jeff, you're not drinking.
2757000	2758000	Oh, I'm all done.
2758000	2759000	You're all done?
2760000	2761000	What the fuck?
2762000	2764000	Oh, he's getting some other drinks.
2764000	2766000	Kayleen, can...
2766000	2767000	I want to...
2767000	2769000	I want to bring my fianc√© up.
2771000	2772000	Do you want me to bartend?
2772000	2774000	Like, I think I could do a better job.
2776000	2778000	Okay, but don't...
2778000	2780000	Yeah, don't get any on your fingers.
2785000	2788000	I feel convinced that this is how my career ends.
2790000	2793000	They tried to get me every way they could, but then...
2793000	2795000	Then he asked Dino to be with him.
2799000	2801000	That's for Jeff, I guess.
2801000	2802000	Jeff!
2802000	2803000	Jeff!
2803000	2804000	Whatever.
2804000	2805000	Cutting board guy.
2805000	2808000	Not only do you have face blindness, you have name blindness.
2808000	2810000	I have other people blindness.
2811000	2817000	But I want to bring my woman up, Erin McGathey.
2817000	2818000	That's my job.
2818000	2822000	Now, Erin McGathey!
2826000	2827000	Isn't that my job?
2827000	2829000	That's what I was just struggling with.
2829000	2831000	It's like, maybe Kayleen...
2831000	2834000	Erin could sit there for a second, but at a certain point,
2834000	2836000	we've got to put a pin in Kayleen.
2836000	2840000	But I want you to come back up and play Dungeons & Dragons with us later, if you would.
2840000	2841000	Oh, yeah.
2846000	2849000	But we'll just play it by ear right now.
2849000	2852000	I'm not very good at delegating.
2852000	2854000	I'm familiar with Armand Jones.
2854000	2856000	Cutting board is beautiful.
2856000	2863000	I was camping on Wednesday, and I went camping with my best friend and our dog.
2864000	2868000	And we were just having a spirit journey, camping trip.
2870000	2873000	This is really when I'm going to take a shit.
2882000	2886000	I am going to tell a cooking story, and Dino does get very jealous of me.
2889000	2891000	He's bounding back to heaven.
2892000	2894000	I had pre-cooked some fettuccine.
2895000	2896000	I was going to make a...
2896000	2900000	Hey, remember when the 18-year-old poured booze for her?
2900000	2902000	That's not... I don't know what you're talking about.
2904000	2906000	Anyway, me and my friend got really drunk,
2906000	2908000	and we had this fettuccine and no cutting board,
2908000	2910000	and I had this handful of fettuccine,
2910000	2913000	and I dropped it in the dirt at our campsite,
2913000	2916000	and then tried to wash it off and spick it,
2916000	2920000	and then had it on the picnic table and was cutting it on the picnic table,
2920000	2926000	and then put it on a plate, and me and my friend almost broke our teeth on the dirt.
2926000	2931000	So thank you for this, and we'll use that.
2931000	2933000	So you're welcome, Jeff.
2933000	2934000	Thank you.
2934000	2935000	It's crazy.
2935000	2937000	Dino, you can take a shit.
2937000	2940000	Oh, I don't really have to. It was a bit.
2941000	2945000	Actually, once you mentioned cooking, the shit went right up me.
2946000	2950000	It's easy that you can take wood, two different colors of wood.
2950000	2952000	There's a lighter wood and a darker wood.
2952000	2957000	Yeah, that's ash and cherry on that one.
2957000	2960000	Did you start with other wood items?
2961000	2964000	You just gave me a look like that was a stupid question.
2964000	2965000	I'm sorry.
2965000	2966000	I guess it was.
2966000	2967000	I apologize for that.
2967000	2968000	It was a stupid question.
2968000	2970000	He gives a lot of those looks.
2970000	2972000	Did you start with cutting boards, or were you like,
2972000	2975000	oh, a table, or a roof, or hammers?
2975000	2977000	You know, those wood hammers.
2977000	2982000	It was just something that I kind of stumbled across because I was making like,
2982000	2984000	I was setting up my garage to be a wood shop,
2984000	2986000	and so I was kind of making all the fixtures for a wood shop,
2986000	2989000	and then that was kind of like the first big thing.
2989000	2991000	Are you going through something?
2991000	2992000	No.
2992000	2994000	It's just a creative outlet for me.
2994000	2995000	That's fun.
2995000	2998000	I mean, this is his way of not going through something.
2998000	3001000	If he goes through something, we're in trouble.
3002000	3004000	We're our necks on the chopping block.
3004000	3010000	The wood glue, this is the thing I can't get my finger out because I'm like,
3010000	3013000	I know nothing about cooking, and I was thinking in my head like,
3013000	3015000	okay, what should a good cutting board be?
3015000	3017000	It should be like an anvil.
3017000	3022000	It's like in a world where metal is malleable.
3022000	3026000	We need a piece of metal on which we hit other metal.
3026000	3033000	It's got to be like the most like unpervertible metal ever.
3033000	3035000	God, sometimes you're stupid.
3035000	3038000	And a cutting board, it should be that of cooking.
3038000	3040000	So it's like, okay, well, and then you're like,
3040000	3042000	oh, I took some dark wood and some white wood and glued it together.
3042000	3046000	Motherfucker, so if I smash this over my knee,
3046000	3048000	is it going to break into?
3048000	3050000	I shouldn't.
3050000	3053000	Wood glue, therefore, holy shit, wood glue.
3053000	3057000	Yeah, but when I did those, I used what's called a pipe clamp.
3057000	3063000	So it applied like, I want to say like three to 500 pounds of pressure on each clamp.
3063000	3065000	And that makes a difference.
3065000	3067000	The glue itself isn't just like...
3067000	3072000	The excess glue squeezes out, and then it's a real tight bond, and then it...
3072000	3074000	See, what?
3074000	3077000	I don't know, the excess glue squeezes out.
3077000	3080000	Hey, this isn't like a fucking...
3080000	3084000	If you've just tuned in, the podcast says, yes, it's never become about...
3084000	3086000	Dan, what was the last thing that you...
3086000	3090000	Hey, Erin, room 218 with that wood glue talk.
3090000	3094000	Dan, what was the last thing that you cooked?
3094000	3098000	You know, I know you're trying to just make fun of me and embarrass me.
3098000	3100000	I'm not trying to make fun of you, I'm just, I'm really curious.
3100000	3102000	Dan is the worst...
3102000	3105000	Can I tell the story about when you were talking to me about like what this...
3105000	3108000	I never saw the sopranos, and I asked them,
3108000	3111000	why is everyone so into the sopranos?
3111000	3115000	And he said, oh, it's just great, because, you know, all this stuff is happening,
3115000	3118000	murderers are happening and all this, and...
3118000	3122000	But people are talking about, hey, yeah, you know, like there's cooking going on,
3122000	3128000	like, hey, pass me another pickle, we need more mayonnaise in the pickle.
3128000	3131000	Like, pickled stuffed mayonnaise?
3131000	3132000	You know nothing about...
3132000	3134000	That's all he got out of my description of the sopranos.
3134000	3136000	He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3136000	3138000	Mayonnaise in a pickle? That's the worst...
3138000	3140000	That sounds like the worst fucking thing I've ever...
3140000	3143000	I don't know anything about food, I don't care about food, it's dumb.
3143000	3145000	Food is dumb.
3145000	3147000	You had bad pizza today and you knew it.
3147000	3150000	Here are a couple of things that are stupid that everyone in this audience
3150000	3153000	and everyone in the world needs to hear once and for all are stupid.
3153000	3154000	Food.
3154000	3155000	Close.
3155000	3156000	Fuck you.
3156000	3157000	Fuck you.
3157000	3158000	Fuck you.
3158000	3159000	Close.
3159000	3160000	Hair.
3160000	3162000	I care about hair more than anything in the world.
3164000	3165000	Food is dumb.
3165000	3166000	You take it for granted.
3166000	3167000	You don't think it's dumb?
3167000	3168000	I know I do.
3168000	3169000	You're finished.
3169000	3172000	When I cook a nice duck pie for you, you love it.
3172000	3173000	You're right.
3173000	3177000	And when I met Erin, she made homemade guacamole
3177000	3180000	and it tasted better than the regular stuff.
3180000	3183000	See, little baby likes his bottle.
3188000	3191000	Also, you do that thing like late at night,
3191000	3194000	like I'll get up to go downstairs and get some water or something
3194000	3197000	and you'd be like, oh, you're making some food?
3198000	3202000	You're to make a guacamole and cheese?
3204000	3207000	Don't you have like a cheeseburger song and shit?
3209000	3212000	Because he knows that even though I know that he's a 41-year-old man,
3212000	3214000	that voice, I'm like, yes.
3214000	3217000	My uterus just leads me down to the kitchen.
3217000	3221000	You'll give me one of these babies that wants cheese, won't you?
3221000	3224000	That's going to be fascinating when we have kids in the kitchen.
3224000	3227000	I'm like making like little bananas for the kids and dance like,
3227000	3230000	but me too, I want a banana.
3230000	3232000	It's not like that.
3234000	3238000	It's like that emotionally, but that's not how I talk.
3239000	3242000	I make it cooler than that.
3244000	3247000	It's like empowered who's wanted bananas.
3248000	3250000	This isn't food, but last night you were like,
3250000	3254000	and you'll get the water for Dan too?
3255000	3257000	Never talk like that.
3257000	3259000	It's got to be right. It's got to be.
3259000	3261000	It's got to be while you talk.
3261000	3262000	Do that.
3262000	3266000	And then I'm like, are you going to squeeze out the excess glue?
3267000	3268000	218.
3268000	3272000	If I get that water for baby, you're going to squeeze out that glue.
3272000	3275000	And he's like, yes, I am.
3276000	3280000	But I've been wearing the same pants for so long.
3282000	3284000	I have a life hack.
3287000	3289000	Kaitlyn, can I have a drink?
3289000	3291000	Or can anyone else form a drink?
3291000	3294000	You can tell by how much he's laughing how true it is.
3296000	3300000	I mean, Dan, we do have moments that are like, oh, shit.
3301000	3305000	It will be interesting when there are kids in the mix.
3305000	3310000	Well, there's points in the morning when I'm not working,
3310000	3312000	when I don't have to get out of bed and go to work.
3312000	3314000	We both have to get up for the same thing.
3314000	3317000	I'm more hesitant to get out of bed.
3317000	3320000	The way she'll get me out of bed is by actually,
3320000	3324000	she could commit to actually dressing me like her baby,
3324000	3326000	which freaks me out.
3326000	3327000	No, stop.
3328000	3331000	I used to be a nurse for a quadriplegic man.
3333000	3338000	So she knows how to get me from the bed to the car,
3338000	3340000	even if I don't want to.
3340000	3343000	I just do it until it embarrasses him.
3345000	3348000	Dan is notorious for not wanting to take baths.
3348000	3353000	And he tweeted maybe a couple years ago about,
3353000	3356000	he's like, oh, this is why people take baths.
3356000	3358000	And I was like, big bubble bath.
3358000	3360000	And all my friends were like, of course,
3360000	3362000	that's how you get babies in a bath.
3365000	3369000	All your friends, what do you hang out with some vindictive,
3369000	3372000	what are you, Archie comics?
3373000	3378000	I have a lot of friends who laugh at your bath habits.
3381000	3385000	Dan, remember the misstep when I bought you those bath crayons?
3386000	3389000	Bath crayons?
3389000	3390000	Bath crayons?
3390000	3392000	This is more on me than on us on him.
3392000	3396000	This is more about me wanting to engage with Dan in a way that...
3396000	3398000	You just want him to be clean every day.
3398000	3399000	Yeah, well, I was...
3399000	3401000	Here's a rubber ducky.
3401000	3403000	I'm an overachiever.
3403000	3409000	I was the Tracy flick of my school.
3409000	3413000	When Dan says, I need to buy some bath bubbles.
3413000	3414000	I bought the bath bubbles.
3414000	3416000	I was like, without thinking about it on Amazon,
3416000	3417000	I was like, oh, cool.
3417000	3420000	They're Arctic bath toys.
3420000	3423000	I'll get those and bath crayons.
3423000	3424000	And then I got all this...
3424000	3427000	Like, not even thinking, like, this is for a 41-year-old.
3427000	3430000	Yeah, but you're not the one who's wrong.
3431000	3432000	What the fuck is a bath crayon?
3432000	3433000	What am I supposed to do?
3433000	3434000	Right on the water?
3434000	3435000	What?
3436000	3438000	That's what three-year-olds ask.
3438000	3440000	I don't even know if I took them out.
3440000	3443000	Because I also have this idea, and this is equally stupid,
3443000	3445000	that, like, I'll have these crayons in the shower.
3445000	3447000	Because you get good ideas in the shower.
3447000	3450000	And someone brought this up on the podcast a while back.
3450000	3454000	Yeah, a lot of his ideas are, green goes well with blue.
3454000	3456000	Well, no, he'll be away from his eye, Harmon,
3456000	3458000	so you could write on the shower wall.
3458000	3463000	The only idea I get in the shower is, I can't believe they won.
3465000	3467000	You can't believe you won?
3467000	3469000	The society made me take a shower.
3469000	3470000	Oh, I say you can't believe they won.
3470000	3472000	It stings my skin!
3472000	3474000	That's not stinging.
3474000	3475000	It's like needles.
3475000	3477000	That is not pain.
3477000	3480000	Someone break his shin.
3480000	3483000	That is not pain.
3484000	3487000	Does that hurt when someone shakes your hand?
3487000	3494000	You know, it's a pain offset by what I get out of it.
3494000	3498000	What if you imagined that you were in a waterfall when you were taking a shower?
3499000	3502000	What if every time you got into a shower...
3502000	3505000	This is what their couples therapy is like, by the way.
3505000	3510000	Draw a waterfall scene with the bath grands in the shower.
3510000	3511000	Yeah.
3511000	3513000	See, our 18-year-old couples therapist.
3513000	3514000	Sounds great.
3514000	3515000	Well, here's what I want to do.
3515000	3519000	And it's not ageism, and it's not because...
3519000	3523000	It's because your cutting board legacy is complete.
3523000	3527000	And you are avoiding it, which is more admirable,
3527000	3529000	and it's going to make more people want to get your cutting board.
3529000	3535000	So I want to make sure, Jeff, before you leave...
3535000	3537000	Are you sure there's no place people can find you
3537000	3540000	if they're questing for the perfect cutting board?
3540000	3542000	Just follow them home.
3542000	3543000	Yeah.
3543000	3545000	Well, I mean, you could tweet me.
3545000	3548000	I'm at Lazy Woodworker.
3548000	3552000	Would you sell yourself, God damn it?
3552000	3553000	No, that's good.
3553000	3554000	At least they know where to find you.
3554000	3555000	I don't know.
3555000	3556000	It's a start.
3556000	3557000	You don't have to be like,
3557000	3562000	oh, I've decided I'm going to take my cutting board empire to the NASDAQ.
3562000	3564000	But at least they know where to find you.
3564000	3568000	You won't be lost in the snow of podcasts to chaos.
3568000	3569000	Because these are great cutting boards.
3569000	3570000	They are good.
3570000	3571000	You should be sharing your...
3571000	3572000	These are really, really nice.
3572000	3575000	Yeah, yours is maple and walnut.
3575000	3576000	Oh, my God.
3576000	3577000	Two 18, buddy.
3577000	3581000	There will be no excess glue.
3581000	3582000	All right.
3582000	3584000	So let's only the appropriate amount.
3584000	3585000	I use all the glue.
3585000	3588000	Let's thank Jeff, the cutting board guy, for joining us.
3588000	3590000	Because we need the real estate up here.
3590000	3592000	Thank you, sir.
3592000	3595000	You can see him out in the lobby.
3595000	3600000	Get his Twitter handle from him on the thing.
3600000	3601000	Erin's got the right idea.
3601000	3602000	She knows what she's doing.
3602000	3603000	That's why I'm engaged.
3603000	3604000	She knows where to go.
3604000	3605000	Because you know where we're going with this.
3605000	3606000	I don't know.
3606000	3607000	Oh, no.
3607000	3609000	Kelly, frankly, you're popping.
3609000	3612000	So you're staying up here.
3612000	3614000	That's an industry term.
3614000	3616000	She's got a big Q rating.
3616000	3617000	Yeah.
3617000	3619000	Is it excessive to get another round of applause for Kelly,
3619000	3620000	who's so wonderful?
3620000	3623000	She's turning 18 with us.
3623000	3624000	She did it.
3624000	3626000	This is the New Year's Eve of her life.
3626000	3629000	Also, congrats on knowing what you wanted to do tonight
3629000	3630000	and coming by yourself.
3630000	3631000	That's really cool.
3631000	3632000	It is kind of an awesome one.
3632000	3634000	It makes you want to hit her with a 2 by 4 as well,
3634000	3635000	though, right?
3635000	3637000	Because you weren't that cool when you were 18.
3637000	3639000	And then again, what was the idea of being cool,
3639000	3642000	being characterized by coming to see you,
3642000	3646000	and then the idea that all of her friends were, like, gross?
3646000	3648000	I'm like, well, who are they?
3648000	3650000	I feel like Kaitlyn and I would have been buddies.
3650000	3652000	And we would go home and we would write down a transcript
3652000	3653000	of Harmontown.
3653000	3654000	And then I'd be like...
3654000	3656000	Oh, God.
3656000	3658000	I'm trying to meet Jeff.
3658000	3660000	Hey, Jeff.
3660000	3662000	You guys would sit cross-legged on a bed together
3662000	3665000	and listen to an LP of me?
3665000	3666000	What do you think he means?
3666000	3667000	I think it would be like,
3667000	3671000	how would you improve this episode?
3671000	3674000	Sorry, that was...
3674000	3675000	Sorry.
3675000	3678000	Yes, we would sit and we would just listen to the LP.
3678000	3680000	I just didn't want it to get sexy in that situation.
3680000	3681000	Not that it would.
3681000	3682000	Nobody did.
3682000	3683000	All right.
3683000	3684000	Let's welcome Life's time.
3684000	3685000	Edit.
3685000	3687000	The World's Cutting Board.
3687000	3689000	Spencer Crittenden is here.
3689000	3690000	Whoo!
3690000	3696000	The World's Cutting Board.
3696000	3701000	Whoo!
3701000	3702000	Hey, everybody.
3702000	3703000	Hey, Spencer.
3703000	3705000	Can Kaitlyn have your cutting board?
3705000	3706000	No, I need it.
3706000	3707000	God damn you.
3707000	3709000	That's going to be a great dice board.
3709000	3710000	Oh, man.
3710000	3711000	The acoustics.
3711000	3714000	I want to get a mic down on that thing
3714000	3716000	and hear those dice hit that cutting board.
3716000	3719000	We could mic the cutting board itself.
3719000	3720000	Yeah.
3720000	3722000	It could get its own mic.
3722000	3724000	Hey, weren't you telling me about...
3724000	3725000	We could do reaction takes of it.
3725000	3728000	Isn't there a new kind of earphones that, like,
3728000	3730000	play sound into your bones?
3730000	3732000	I mean, these are relative term.
3732000	3735000	But, yeah, there's these earphones that work
3735000	3738000	by vibrating your, like, your skull bones
3738000	3740000	or your jaw bones or your ear bones directly
3740000	3743000	instead of vibrating a membrane
3743000	3746000	which transmits the vibration through sound,
3746000	3749000	you know, through the air into your eardrum.
3749000	3752000	It skips the middleman entirely and just vibrates your...
3752000	3754000	Man, I don't need that shit.
3754000	3756000	It's fucking hippie garbage, man.
3756000	3758000	It's like fucking tofu.
3760000	3762000	Spencer, do you cook for yourself?
3762000	3763000	I haven't lately.
3763000	3764000	I used to cook a lot.
3764000	3767000	I was huge into food network and stuff,
3767000	3768000	cooking channel.
3768000	3769000	Oh, man.
3769000	3770000	Oh, man.
3770000	3772000	What's your dish?
3772000	3774000	I mean, the thing that I bring around to parties
3774000	3776000	is this crazy cheese dip.
3776000	3779000	It's probably too heavy for an L.A. kind of crowd,
3779000	3781000	but it's quite delicious.
3781000	3783000	It's full of cheese and bacon,
3783000	3785000	and it just tastes good. I don't know.
3785000	3787000	Did you bring it here?
3787000	3789000	Yes, Dino. He has a...
3789000	3790000	Well, what the fuck?
3790000	3791000	I mean, he lives in L.A.
3791000	3793000	He's a fond new cauldron in the back.
3793000	3794000	Anyone can go...
3794000	3797000	Is somebody not much older than Kayleen?
3797000	3800000	Maybe there's some advice you can give her
3800000	3803000	from just, you know, more closer to the shores
3803000	3804000	of the River Styx...
3804000	3806000	Watch Cooking Channel?
3806000	3807000	I mean, that's what I did.
3807000	3808000	It was a dumb question.
3808000	3810000	You learn a lot of good stuff, man.
3810000	3812000	You know about deglazing a pan?
3812000	3813000	Holy shit.
3813000	3814000	It changes your life.
3814000	3817000	This guy knows.
3817000	3819000	You deglaze pans every day.
3819000	3821000	I fucking... That's all I do.
3821000	3822000	He loves it.
3822000	3823000	It's important.
3823000	3824000	No, I mean, I just...
3824000	3825000	You just do it.
3825000	3826000	I don't know.
3826000	3829000	My parents kind of made us cook as kids and stuff,
3829000	3831000	so I picked up a thing or two.
3831000	3832000	I think it's lame.
3832000	3834000	Yeah, it's a real cop-out.
3834000	3835000	Fuck you.
3835000	3837000	What are you guys shooting her, like, slaves?
3837000	3838000	Why would you forget the bit you like it
3838000	3839000	when you taste it?
3839000	3840000	Yeah.
3840000	3843000	They're like legal slaves.
3843000	3845000	Yeah, the key word is legal.
3845000	3846000	Yeah, I had this kid.
3846000	3849000	Now let's make him work until I can kick him out.
3849000	3851000	Actually, when I go to my dad's restaurant,
3851000	3853000	he doesn't cook the food for us.
3853000	3855000	We have to cook it at his restaurant.
3855000	3857000	Well, that sounds more, you know,
3857000	3860000	that's more like, ugh, you're taking on my craft.
3860000	3861000	I'm gonna stand up and watch.
3861000	3864000	Is it like a Build-A-Bear?
3864000	3865000	It's a restaurant.
3865000	3867000	It's an Italian restaurant,
3867000	3870000	so I guess combining the ingredients,
3870000	3873000	building a dish, building a bear.
3873000	3875000	Have you ever been mad at your dad
3875000	3876000	and said that you don't like his food?
3876000	3878000	Is that, like, a sticking point?
3878000	3880000	I don't think I've ever said that.
3880000	3883000	Do you kind of admire your dad for leaving, don't you,
3883000	3887000	on a deep, unconscious level?
3887000	3889000	Like, you blame yourself,
3889000	3893000	and you are like, he's a hero because he boned out.
3893000	3898000	And I'm telling you, you need to stop thinking that.
3898000	3900000	I love that you think I'm a bad guy.
3900000	3901000	You love your dad, and he's not hanging out with you.
3901000	3903000	Your mom dropped you off here.
3903000	3904000	She's got your back.
3904000	3906000	I'm going to the zoo tomorrow with my dad.
3906000	3908000	Your dad's lame.
3908000	3909000	He fucking left.
3909000	3912000	Dan, you can't be Kayleen's dad.
3912000	3914000	She already has a dad.
3914000	3915000	You need a better dad, bro.
3915000	3917000	You need a dad that lives in L.A.
3917000	3919000	You need to just hang out, okay,
3919000	3920000	and watch him drink in a mirror.
3920000	3922000	Dan...
3922000	3925000	It's going to be fun, trust me.
3925000	3928000	Kayleen, Dan is literally jealous of your dad,
3928000	3930000	and he has known you for an hour.
3930000	3933000	No, I'm actually, I don't know, I'm bonding with her about,
3933000	3935000	like, I don't know, I was a kid.
3935000	3937000	You're not bonding anywhere.
3937000	3939000	You ever watch Rick and Morty?
3939000	3941000	Yeah.
3941000	3943000	The idea with the...
3943000	3946000	Dan needed an applause break.
3946000	3949000	Don't you wish your dad made Rick and Morty?
3950000	3954000	The Beth character, the mom character,
3954000	3960000	the whole point is that she thinks that Rick is cool because he left,
3960000	3962000	and she's wrong.
3962000	3966000	Like, she worships exceptionality,
3966000	3970000	and she thinks that people who leave are smarter than people who stay.
3970000	3972000	You just tanked the show.
3972000	3974000	No one's going to watch anymore.
3974000	3977000	And it's something that we should all monitor ourselves for,
3977000	3980000	because we often think that people who'd, you know,
3980000	3982000	like, I play to the guy in the back of the room that's like,
3982000	3984000	who are you?
3984000	3986000	I'm the mayor of Seattle.
3986000	3988000	And I'm like, that guy must be back there.
3988000	3989000	But then there's all these people that are like,
3989000	3992000	I made you a cutting board, and I'm like, fuck you.
3992000	3995000	And I gotta stop that, Kayleen.
3995000	3997000	Okay.
3997000	3999000	Oh.
4009000	4012000	We're getting married in 49 days.
4015000	4018000	We'll see how Toronto goes.
4018000	4019000	I won't be in Toronto.
4019000	4021000	I have my bachelorette party next week.
4021000	4023000	I guess we'll get married, though.
4023000	4025000	Is it okay, speaking of this,
4025000	4027000	is it like cooking and stuff?
4027000	4030000	Is it okay if we register at Sir La Table?
4030000	4031000	Table.
4031000	4032000	What?
4032000	4033000	Sir La Table.
4033000	4034000	That means south of the table.
4034000	4035000	What does that mean?
4035000	4036000	It means south of the table.
4036000	4037000	It means on the table.
4037000	4039000	It means on the table.
4039000	4040000	It's a store.
4040000	4042000	Do you care where we register?
4042000	4043000	I don't.
4043000	4044000	No, I don't.
4044000	4045000	No.
4045000	4046000	Okay.
4046000	4047000	Sir La Table.
4047000	4050000	Is it time to affiliate?
4050000	4052000	Oh, are we, boy.
4052000	4053000	Is this show over here?
4053000	4055000	No, the show started at like 10 something.
4055000	4057000	I've never been this drunk in my life.
4057000	4058000	That's not true.
4058000	4062000	I always think that when I see you, but...
4062000	4066000	This time, I was sure.
4067000	4068000	Can we end it?
4068000	4071000	We don't have to do Dungeons and Dragons, do we?
4071000	4073000	Fuck!
4073000	4074000	I don't know how to do it.
4074000	4076000	You're out of your element, man.
4076000	4077000	I don't know how to do it.
4077000	4078000	You don't have...
4078000	4079000	I'm scared.
4079000	4080000	You're going to have a great time.
4080000	4082000	All right.
4084000	4086000	They love me.
4086000	4088000	Or Dungeons and Dragons.
4088000	4090000	But we should start now, huh?
4090000	4091000	I think so.
4091000	4093000	You're the one that looked at a clock or something.
4093000	4094000	I don't care.
4094000	4096000	Well, should we improvise the theme song?
4096000	4097000	Let's do a quick one.
4097000	4099000	Aaron's got some Seattle facts.
4099000	4101000	Seattle facts.
4103000	4105000	Are you the announcer for Seattle facts?
4105000	4107000	Well, I was just trying to vamp.
4107000	4110000	Why don't we play Dungeons and Dragons?
4110000	4112000	In Seattle.
4112000	4115000	Add the Seattle facts in the story.
4115000	4119000	We can tell the people about the Seattle facts after the show.
4119000	4122000	I'll be in the lobby if you want to know more about your show.
4122000	4125000	Did you know the typewriter was invented here?
4125000	4126000	No, I did not.
4126000	4127000	All right, good.
4127000	4128000	Thank you for coming.
4128000	4132000	First Beatles song was played in the U.S. in Seattle.
4132000	4133000	True.
4133000	4134000	Yeah.
4134000	4136000	Also, most people with college degrees?
4136000	4137000	It's the most literate city.
4137000	4138000	I'm sure they know that.
4139000	4143000	Also, the needle is made out of dads who have left their families.
4148000	4152000	Like their whole bodies or just their nose bones or something?
4152000	4153000	It's really complicated.
4153000	4154000	There's an algorithm.
4154000	4155000	I don't get it.
4157000	4167000	The Seattle, yeah, the Space Needle is constructed out of the 10 percent of the salary that the city takes from dads who earn the right to go find themselves.
4169000	4170000	Well, all right.
4170000	4172000	I'm a Seattle judge.
4172000	4174000	I'm also from Maine.
4176000	4179000	You may leave, but 10 percent to the Space Needle.
4180000	4181000	This gavel sound.
4183000	4185000	Okay, Dungeons and Dragons.
4187000	4189000	Dungeons and Dragons.
4190000	4191000	So tired.
4191000	4192000	He's a prospector.
4192000	4193000	So tired.
4193000	4195000	He's so tired he's going to be rich.
4195000	4197000	He's going to hit gold.
4198000	4199000	Dungeons and Dragons.
4200000	4201000	Come on.
4201000	4202000	Let's move it along.
4203000	4206000	Oh, well, it's not.
4206000	4207000	Wait.
4207000	4208000	Hold on a second.
4208000	4209000	We're going to hand out the character sheets.
4209000	4210000	Yeah, there's this one.
4210000	4211000	What?
4211000	4212000	I have to do something?
4212000	4214000	No, you just sit there, man.
4214000	4215000	All right.
4215000	4218000	Just take the top and pass it down.
4219000	4221000	Is this about the imagination?
4221000	4222000	Thank you.
4222000	4223000	And most mostly.
4223000	4224000	Who do you got there?
4224000	4226000	It's most mostly about rules.
4226000	4227000	Do you know?
4227000	4228000	Rules.
4228000	4229000	Fuck rules.
4229000	4230000	Oh, shit.
4230000	4233000	You're not going to fit in well at all.
4235000	4236000	Just follow my lead.
4236000	4237000	I'm known as the expert.
4237000	4238000	Oh, great.
4240000	4243000	I'm writing a few books on how to play correctly.
4244000	4245000	Hide in it.
4245000	4247000	It's not going to go well.
4247000	4248000	Okay.
4248000	4249000	Give me.
4249000	4251000	What are you going to do, Kayleen?
4251000	4252000	What do you think?
4252000	4253000	You're growing up now.
4253000	4254000	You're going to go to college?
4254000	4256000	Yeah, I'm doing the Running Start program.
4256000	4259000	So I'm a high schooler at a community college.
4259000	4261000	You're a what in a community college?
4261000	4263000	So I'm a senior in high school.
4263000	4266000	But I take all my classes at a community college.
4266000	4267000	Oh, cool.
4267000	4268000	It's called Full Time Running Start.
4268000	4269000	You can take like half and half or four people.
4269000	4270000	Wow.
4270000	4271000	Then you have my high school.
4271000	4275000	So then after that I want to go to Central Washington University.
4275000	4280000	And they have an obscure degree that I really want to get.
4280000	4283000	It's called Primate Behavior and Ecology.
4284000	4285000	Wow.
4285000	4287000	Hey, this guy has it.
4287000	4290000	There's a guy with super hairy arms raised in his photo.
4290000	4291000	They're tattoos.
4291000	4293000	You're okay with me saying that, right?
4293000	4294000	Yeah, those are tattoos.
4294000	4295000	Yeah, those are tattoos.
4295000	4296000	They're tattoos.
4296000	4298000	I mean, it's not like it's devoid of him.
4298000	4299000	I think your arms are so hairy.
4299000	4301000	You just might be a blotchy.
4302000	4303000	By the way, beautiful tattoo, sir.
4303000	4304000	Beautiful tattoo.
4304000	4306000	Primate ecology.
4306000	4307000	Okay, all right.
4307000	4309000	Great assault, department.
4312000	4313000	All right, here we go.
4314000	4316000	Wait, is that a degree you'd recommend?
4317000	4318000	You can't get paid any money.
4318000	4319000	So no, right?
4320000	4321000	Well, cool.
4323000	4324000	That is worth it.
4324000	4325000	No.
4325000	4326000	So say it again.
4326000	4329000	Primate Behavior and Ecology.
4329000	4330000	And Ecology.
4330000	4332000	Yeah, so they're an environment that they live in.
4332000	4333000	All right.
4333000	4337000	Yeah, the reason they have that degree is the first chimpanzee to learn sign language
4337000	4342000	named Washoe, like she grew up somewhere else, but then they like ran out of funding.
4342000	4343000	Had to find a place for her.
4343000	4349000	So Central Washington University built a housing unit for her and her family, and they moved
4349000	4350000	her there.
4350000	4357000	Oh, and so if you were to spend your life like reaching out to other primates, learning
4357000	4361000	language and then connecting with them and stuff, that would be like...
4361000	4363000	I don't want to do a language experiment, necessarily.
4363000	4368000	I want to work with orangutans and like rehabilitate and get them in the wild, like in Indonesia
4368000	4369000	or something.
4369000	4370000	Oh.
4371000	4372000	You don't say the G?
4372000	4373000	It's orangutans?
4374000	4375000	They're not orangutans?
4376000	4377000	It's orangutan.
4377000	4378000	It is orangutan?
4378000	4379000	Yeah.
4379000	4380000	There's no G on the end.
4380000	4381000	God damn it.
4381000	4382000	It changes your whole world, doesn't it?
4382000	4383000	Welcome to Earth, asshole.
4384000	4385000	Sorry about my friend.
4385000	4386000	By the way, this is fucked up.
4386000	4388000	This is like a fucking tense form.
4388000	4390000	Yeah, just don't worry about that.
4390000	4391000	What the fuck?
4391000	4394000	It's the most joyless piece of paper I ever found in my life.
4394000	4395000	Yeah.
4395000	4396000	Follow my lead.
4396000	4397000	I don't want to do it.
4397000	4398000	I don't want to do it.
4398000	4399000	That's horrible.
4399000	4400000	Just don't.
4400000	4401000	Just do what you're doing.
4401000	4402000	Yeah.
4402000	4403000	Just do that.
4403000	4404000	But later.
4404000	4405000	Look at this.
4405000	4407000	It's not like anybody knows what's going on.
4407000	4408000	It's awful.
4408000	4409000	It's boring.
4409000	4410000	There's like rules everywhere.
4410000	4411000	No.
4411000	4412000	No.
4412000	4413000	Let Dino do it.
4413000	4414000	Fuck everyone.
4415000	4416000	Dan, let's do.
4416000	4420000	Let's do the theme song that we always do for Dino.
4420000	4421000	Oh, that one.
4421000	4422000	Yeah.
4422000	4423000	Do you throw the papers?
4423000	4424000	Is that what you did?
4424000	4426000	Yeah, I threw the fucking papers.
4426000	4427000	They're strewn about.
4427000	4428000	That's what I did to my tax forms, too.
4428000	4431000	Well, I went to jail for 10 years.
4431000	4433000	Obviously, I'm the only one who cares about D&D.
4433000	4435000	It's been this way since the beginning.
4435000	4436000	Shoo.
4436000	4437000	Good.
4437000	4438000	Good.
4438000	4439000	Good.
4439000	4440000	Oh, all right.
4440000	4441000	Here we go.
4441000	4447000	Did you do last time on Harman town?
4447000	4452000	Our heroes were faced with their greatest foe, Father Tinder.
4452000	4453000	Good.
4453000	4454000	Good.
4454000	4455000	Good.
4455000	4456000	Good.
4456000	4458000	He discovered the killer they pursued
4458000	4462000	was none other than the juice-loving priest who watched over the town.
4462000	4465000	Father Tinder attacked with deadly magics,
4465000	4470000	and it was all Sharpie could do to stay alive until his friends arrived to save the day.
4470000	4473000	Together, they dealt the father a mortal blow,
4473000	4479000	but before he could die, the evil magic of a shard of power transformed him into a hideous demon.
4479000	4482000	Krista Berg deployed the robot baby.
4482000	4485000	The perilous gambit failed as the baby's arm was melted off,
4485000	4490000	but his sacrifice gave our heroes the crucial seconds they needed to ready a plan.
4490000	4495000	Dignity put water into a hole in the Father Tinder's skull and Sharpie froze it.
4495000	4500000	With Krista Berg's final blow, the combination shattered his head into pieces,
4500000	4504000	felling the demon in a single devastating moment.
4504000	4507000	But with the mayor dead at the hands of the gang,
4507000	4510000	would they really be able to simply walk away,
4510000	4513000	or would they be made to pay for their crimes?
4513000	4515000	Would the barrier hold strong?
4515000	4519000	Or would they come priced without the power of the shard?
4519000	4523000	Hey, I didn't recommend this. Just for the record, this was other people's idea.
4523000	4526000	I mean, and what a bad world.
4526000	4528000	I'm gonna go pick up my pieces of paper.
4528000	4532000	Find out this time on an all-new episode of Harmon doodle-doo.
4532000	4534000	Doo, goo, goo.
4534000	4541000	Pivot up, pivot up, pivot up, pivot up, pivot up, pivot up, pivot up, pivot up, pivot up.
4541000	4544000	Let's see, on the W5 form.
4544000	4546000	Alright, so we were fighting it.
4546000	4547000	This is the perfect time for that.
4547000	4550000	We were fighting a guy, and we blew his head off, right?
4550000	4552000	Yeah, well, I mean, you shattered it.
4552000	4554000	I shattered his head. We shattered his head.
4554000	4556000	Krista Berg, yeah.
4556000	4558000	Good job, guys! We did it!
4558000	4560000	Yay!
4560000	4563000	We shattered a giant stone god's head.
4563000	4565000	Is Yay okay to say?
4565000	4566000	Yeah.
4566000	4567000	Yay!
4567000	4570000	Jerks.
4570000	4572000	Fantastic.
4572000	4576000	Alright, I examined my surroundings.
4576000	4583000	Yeah, you're in the broken ruins of the Darmvon household inside the town of Rosebook.
4583000	4586000	You stand upon the shattered corpse of Father Tinder, you see.
4586000	4592000	All of his demonic aspects have faded away, just leaving a bloody heap of chunked flesh.
4592000	4594000	It's just all scattered about the lawn.
4594000	4598000	I take my sword and blow up the universe.
4598000	4601000	Your sword can't do that.
4601000	4604000	Man, I thought you were a hippie.
4604000	4608000	It's a blazing sword. It lights on fire.
4608000	4610000	Yeah, what do I do with it?
4610000	4612000	Not destroy a universe, I guess.
4612000	4615000	Room 218.
4615000	4617000	Spencer, I have a question.
4617000	4618000	Sure.
4618000	4623000	When Father Tinder was originally dying back at his house and Spisble ran away,
4623000	4628000	what was the figure of the dying Father Tinder? Do we ever find out who he was?
4628000	4630000	That was my question, too.
4630000	4635000	That's metagaming. You'd have to discover that yourself in character.
4635000	4639000	She's asking, did we ever actually find out?
4639000	4642000	No, you never actually found out. You ran off.
4642000	4646000	Was Christa Berg in that room when Father Tinder was dying? Do I know there was something there?
4646000	4648000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4648000	4650000	Don't talk down to her.
4650000	4652000	No, I'm answering the question three times.
4652000	4654000	Yeah, I don't like the way...
4654000	4660000	Whoa! I don't like this game. It makes him a bad guy. I usually like Spencer.
4660000	4663000	He's not doing anything wrong.
4663000	4664000	Really?
4664000	4666000	I think it's fine.
4666000	4668000	Why don't you make some necklaces for the group?
4668000	4670000	Me? Okay.
4670000	4673000	La, la, la, la, la.
4673000	4676000	You make six necklaces.
4678000	4683000	I just want to make sure, like, everybody grab everything that's worth anything,
4683000	4686000	because as I've said before, we keep not doing that.
4686000	4692000	Okay, I'm going to grab Spencer's woodblock and give it to Kayleen.
4692000	4695000	The guy made them for you guys. I feel weird.
4695000	4698000	Fuck you, Kayleen. You're not in on it.
4698000	4701000	You're a teen. You don't know what you're talking about.
4701000	4703000	Spencer's not here with us.
4703000	4706000	I think Chris DeBerg is asking the really smart question,
4706000	4709000	which is, like, okay, if that guy was Father Tinder,
4709000	4712000	then who's the Father Tinder that was dying back at that place?
4712000	4715000	Maybe we should go back there and check out the scene there.
4715000	4717000	All right, let's go back there.
4718000	4721000	But I wanted on record that we gathered everything of value,
4721000	4724000	and the next time I ask you if we have any treasure and you say we don't.
4724000	4727000	Well, this area is devoid of value.
4727000	4729000	His corpse is just little chunks of flesh.
4729000	4731000	You don't even see clothing or any blots.
4731000	4733000	All right, devoid of value, people.
4733000	4735000	Wait, do we have the robot baby with us?
4735000	4736000	Yep, his arms melted off.
4736000	4739000	Hey, guys, my arms melted off.
4739000	4742000	Okay, I'm going to walk across the street.
4745000	4748000	Meep, meep.
4748000	4751000	Oh, shit, something exploded over there.
4751000	4752000	Not the baby.
4753000	4755000	Fucking turkey.
4755000	4758000	This is stupid.
4758000	4761000	You make it across the street.
4761000	4763000	You make it across the street.
4763000	4765000	Should I take a shit? Is that what you want?
4765000	4766000	All right.
4766000	4768000	Would that be better for everyone?
4768000	4769000	I don't care, man.
4769000	4772000	Other people care that aren't me, but I don't care.
4772000	4774000	I'll take a shit, I'll take a shit.
4774000	4776000	I don't even have to.
4777000	4778000	Bye, Dino.
4778000	4782000	I think people would have liked watching you learn to...
4783000	4788000	Dino is sitting upon the audience member that suggested he take a shit.
4788000	4790000	This guy's got cripples.
4790000	4791000	I mean crutches.
4791000	4794000	A stranger has...
4794000	4796000	This is what happens.
4796000	4799000	You see what you've done, Dino?
4799000	4801000	You shit before the show.
4803000	4806000	We're not sure you're funny. Sit down.
4809000	4810000	All right.
4810000	4812000	Maybe that'll get Dino to...
4812000	4813000	You gotta ruin the whole thing.
4813000	4815000	At least I know how to shut up.
4815000	4818000	You might have saved it, in all honesty.
4818000	4819000	It's possible.
4819000	4820000	All right, yeah.
4820000	4824000	He gave Dino a way to be subversive and play the game.
4825000	4826000	All right.
4826000	4827000	That guy has crutches.
4827000	4829000	Are your legs hurt more than they were?
4829000	4830000	Oh, wait.
4830000	4832000	I sat on you.
4832000	4834000	On a crippled guy, yeah.
4834000	4835000	Oh, no.
4835000	4837000	Wait, don't you also have a boot on?
4837000	4838000	What the fuck?
4838000	4840000	And they're double. They're double.
4840000	4841000	Oh, okay.
4841000	4842000	Dino sat on a man with a...
4842000	4844000	I stepped on that thing.
4844000	4847000	I stepped on his fucking broken foot.
4847000	4848000	Oh, my God.
4848000	4850000	The two of you have crutched.
4850000	4853000	What happened to the two of you?
4853000	4855000	Do you know each other?
4855000	4856000	No.
4856000	4857000	No.
4857000	4858000	I don't know.
4858000	4861000	That's just this place where they sit people that have crutches?
4861000	4863000	You guys have never met?
4863000	4864000	We had earlier.
4864000	4865000	All right.
4866000	4868000	It's too late in the show for this many plot twists.
4868000	4869000	Yeah.
4869000	4873000	And also, guys with broken feet shouldn't yell at me.
4873000	4874000	Dick.
4875000	4876000	We'll come back to Seattle.
4876000	4879000	There's clearly unplumbed deaths here.
4879000	4882000	I don't know how that word is pronounced, what I just said.
4882000	4883000	All right.
4883000	4886000	So, wherever we are, I examine my surroundings.
4886000	4888000	Heading back to Father Tinder.
4888000	4891000	Let's say you're at Father Tinder's house.
4891000	4892000	You're there.
4892000	4893000	All right.
4894000	4897000	I examine my surroundings.
4897000	4900000	You see the outside of Father Tinder's house.
4900000	4903000	You see the window that's broken leading into his bedroom.
4903000	4905000	That's where he must have broken out of the-
4905000	4906000	Kayleen, come on.
4906000	4909000	Let's go check out the scene of your crime.
4909000	4910000	Okay.
4910000	4911000	Not you.
4911000	4912000	Well, I don't know what to do.
4912000	4914000	How do you guys suppose we get it like up there?
4914000	4917000	Should we like grapple hook to the window or?
4917000	4918000	Well, I mean-
4918000	4919000	Did we unlock the door?
4919000	4920000	The place was the site of it.
4920000	4922000	I would just go up in the front.
4922000	4924000	I mean, it was the place-
4924000	4926000	He got murdered here and then-
4926000	4927000	I don't know.
4927000	4928000	We don't have to be sneaky, right?
4928000	4930000	Sounds like I'm better at this game than anyone.
4930000	4932000	Yeah, you're doing great, Dino.
4932000	4935000	I vote for kicking in the door and going upstairs,
4935000	4937000	but I'm a wizard.
4937000	4938000	Let's do that.
4938000	4942000	You kick in the door and go up the stairs to the bedroom.
4942000	4946000	You see a puddle of water with a gray, silvery,
4946000	4950000	kind of slightly flesh-toned head floating in the middle of it.
4950000	4951000	Oh, I like that.
4951000	4952000	It's melting away.
4952000	4953000	Really?
4953000	4954000	Yep.
4954000	4955000	Does it look like Father Tinder?
4955000	4959000	It looks like if Father Tinder was in the microwave for too long.
4959000	4961000	What the fuck?
4961000	4962000	Hello.
4962000	4963000	Hello, sir.
4963000	4964000	No, that's-
4964000	4965000	Fuck.
4965000	4966000	Tim.
4966000	4967000	No.
4967000	4968000	Are you on?
4968000	4969000	Which form are you on?
4969000	4971000	That's page three.
4971000	4972000	Why can't I try to-
4972000	4973000	Here's your highlight.
4973000	4974000	No, you can do whatever you want.
4974000	4977000	I'm just saying, not going to get results.
4977000	4978000	All right.
4978000	4979000	Pitter.
4979000	4980000	I-
4980000	4982000	My character's not super smart.
4982000	4984000	My knowledge of Arcana, maybe.
4984000	4985000	Have I seen anything like this before?
4985000	4986000	Oh, yeah.
4986000	4987000	Do I know what this is?
4987000	4988000	What's your skill rank on that?
4988000	4994000	Wow, this is a game that we're having fun with.
4994000	4996000	Well, I am.
4996000	4997000	Yeah.
4997000	5003000	Using your knowledge Arcana, you look at this magic and it strikes you as something very familiar.
5003000	5007000	It's actually a common magician trick known as the Simulacrum.
5007000	5009000	Unless I pronounced that wrong.
5009000	5011000	Simulacrum, right?
5011000	5012000	Simulacrum.
5012000	5015000	This is my guy who knows what I'm talking about.
5015000	5018000	They fans of the Simulacrum in the front.
5018000	5019000	Simulacrum.
5019000	5020000	Simulacrum.
5020000	5022000	An ice doppelcare.
5022000	5024000	Spencer, this is why you're famous?
5024000	5025000	Apparently.
5025000	5028000	I mean, again, it's not my idea.
5028000	5030000	I like you so much being yourself.
5030000	5031000	Yeah.
5031000	5032000	Yeah.
5032000	5033000	Leave.
5037000	5039000	What's your room number?
5039000	5040000	218.
5040000	5041000	218.
5041000	5042000	218.
5042000	5043000	Of course, of course.
5043000	5045000	All the girls got it wrong.
5045000	5046000	219.
5046000	5051000	The guy next to me is going to get laid.
5051000	5058000	Looks like we got an ice doppelganger on our hands.
5058000	5063000	I haven't encountered an ice doppelganger.
5063000	5065000	A Simulacrum.
5065000	5067000	Simulacrum before.
5067000	5069000	I'm going to say it like that.
5069000	5071000	Simulacrum.
5071000	5076000	Looks like somebody maybe replaced Father Tinder with a Simulacrum.
5076000	5081000	I look around the room for any clues.
5081000	5083000	Or anything.
5083000	5085000	Clues of what?
5085000	5086000	I don't know.
5086000	5087000	This is awful.
5087000	5091000	Are you now or have you ever been a communist?
5091000	5094000	That's the joy that's here right now.
5094000	5097000	We're just standing in a line, just answering questions.
5097000	5099000	We're sitting.
5099000	5101000	Sitting in a line.
5101000	5102000	Sounds a lot better.
5102000	5104000	Thanks, dungeon master.
5104000	5106000	I know what people are sitting.
5106000	5109000	Is anyone else having an out-of-body experience right now?
5109000	5110000	I wish.
5110000	5114000	Am I the one making it a bad dungeon dragon?
5114000	5117000	I mean, do you think you're making it a bad dungeon?
5117000	5120000	I mean, you're doing what people that were good at football did in high school.
5120000	5125000	I guess that's admirable at some level.
5125000	5128000	I guess we thought they were cool.
5128000	5131000	But it's usually better than this?
5131000	5132000	Yes.
5132000	5133000	All right.
5133000	5134000	Okay.
5134000	5135000	I'll shut up.
5135000	5140000	I'm going to wait and see.
5140000	5143000	Pressure's on, assholes.
5143000	5148000	I'm going to leave the room and walk around the exterior of the house.
5148000	5149000	All right.
5149000	5152000	Upon exiting the room, you hear a sound, a sound.
5152000	5157000	It sounds like wee-woo, wee-woo, wee-woo.
5157000	5158000	You don't hear.
5158000	5164000	You see blue and red lights flashing, is the words I was looking for.
5164000	5170000	Blue and red lights flashing over a hedge outside of the yard.
5170000	5172000	So this looks bad.
5172000	5177000	The police are going to come in and see us with a head and goo.
5177000	5179000	We should probably get out of here.
5179000	5182000	Well, I'll stand on the outside.
5182000	5185000	I have a relationship with the police in this town.
5185000	5190000	And also, I know how to talk to people.
5190000	5191000	All right.
5191000	5194000	And as I've said before, that is my favorite part of the game,
5194000	5197000	is listening to you talk to people.
5197000	5200000	Should we stay or flee while you stall them?
5201000	5203000	It's up to you.
5203000	5204000	We should bone out.
5204000	5205000	Yeah, let's go.
5205000	5206000	They don't trust us.
5206000	5208000	And let her talk to the cops.
5208000	5209000	All right.
5209000	5211000	We flee, and she stays.
5211000	5212000	You flee.
5212000	5213000	Which direction?
5213000	5215000	Should we go and hide out at Spizz Bowls?
5215000	5217000	Yeah, I think we should.
5217000	5221000	You head towards Spizz Bowls while the fuzz arrives.
5221000	5222000	Dignity.
5222000	5225000	You see several guardsmen armed going off.
5225000	5226000	Aha.
5226000	5232000	Hello, fellow-minded friends of the law.
5232000	5237000	That's a very ready greeting you have there.
5237000	5238000	Yes.
5238000	5242000	Well, ever since I was a child, I've written down greetings.
5242000	5244000	I've memorized them.
5244000	5247000	That's a really suspicious thing for someone to say, I think.
5247000	5248000	Is it?
5248000	5251000	I just thought it was eccentric and didn't make a lot of sense.
5251000	5254000	That's what suspicious is a lot of times.
5255000	5256000	Right.
5256000	5257000	Right.
5257000	5260000	Well, I checked out the scene here.
5260000	5262000	Looks like we're good.
5262000	5272000	It looks like justice is floating here, not sinking.
5272000	5276000	I'd go out on a limb here to say things don't look good.
5276000	5278000	I mean, I see a broken window up there.
5278000	5279000	Yeah.
5279000	5283000	And our father's missing, and I just found this pile of human meat chunks that I think
5283000	5285000	might be related.
5285000	5287000	I'll say.
5289000	5291000	You wouldn't know anything about that?
5291000	5292000	Do I?
5292000	5293000	I saw.
5293000	5294000	No.
5294000	5297000	Do you is what I...
5297000	5298000	Do I know anything?
5298000	5299000	I have seen it.
5299000	5300000	Yes.
5300000	5301000	And do I like it?
5301000	5302000	No.
5303000	5304000	I don't.
5304000	5305000	Do you like it?
5305000	5306000	No, I don't.
5306000	5307000	Yeah.
5307000	5308000	All right.
5308000	5311000	Well, so nice to meet you.
5311000	5315000	And I will be on my way unless you have any more information.
5315000	5317000	Which way is that?
5317000	5320000	The way of truth.
5320000	5324000	Well, I mean, speaking of truth, we're just trying to collect some statements.
5324000	5328000	If you want to come down to the Constabulary, it'll just take a minute or two.
5328000	5329000	All right.
5329000	5333000	I have nothing to fear, and I like the Constabulary.
5333000	5335000	I also...
5335000	5337000	I like you.
5337000	5338000	I like you.
5338000	5340000	Well, I mean, I wasn't pleased.
5340000	5341000	And I...
5341000	5347000	And our relationship as fellow law professionals is important to me, and I think that we should...
5347000	5355000	We should just sing the song of goodness together, and no one should stop singing a verse because
5355000	5356000	then the song stops.
5356000	5357000	It's a...
5357000	5358000	It's a...
5358000	5359000	It's a melody.
5359000	5360000	It's a...
5360000	5361000	It's a...
5361000	5364000	Let's sing in a harmony.
5364000	5365000	Ha.
5366000	5369000	Just like my mother used to say.
5370000	5371000	I saw that.
5371000	5372000	I saw that in your eyes.
5372000	5373000	I saw that we had kind of a...
5373000	5374000	You know what?
5374000	5375000	I...
5375000	5379000	I basically got the gist of what you were trying to say.
5379000	5381000	I mean, I could jot down some notes.
5381000	5382000	You don't need to...
5382000	5383000	Great.
5383000	5388000	I take a second, and I look down at the ground, and I'm like, ah, that worked, but really,
5388000	5391000	you just annoyed him away.
5391000	5394000	And then I go, and I head to the...
5394000	5395000	What?
5395000	5396000	I'm just gonna...
5396000	5397000	No.
5397000	5399000	You're just saying a lot of weird stuff.
5399000	5400000	I was being nice.
5400000	5403000	I just don't think we could get a useful statement out of you.
5403000	5404000	All right.
5404000	5405000	You know what?
5405000	5406000	That's...
5406000	5407000	That's fair.
5407000	5408000	I'll do law on my way, and you do it your way.
5408000	5409000	I guess.
5409000	5410000	All right.
5410000	5411000	You keep on...
5411000	5412000	Keep it on.
5412000	5413000	Oh.
5413000	5414000	All right.
5414000	5415000	Jive.
5415000	5416000	Jive, jive.
5416000	5417000	You don't know what happened to anybody.
5417000	5418000	There's exploded meat chunks.
5418000	5419000	Nothing.
5419000	5420000	No idea.
5420000	5421000	I hate it.
5421000	5422000	Don't like it.
5422000	5423000	Have a good night.
5423000	5424000	You too.
5424000	5426000	The guy walks off.
5426000	5428000	The lights fade.
5428000	5430000	Meanwhile, me and Christoperg...
5430000	5434000	Heading towards Spizbulb's tower, if I recall, right?
5434000	5435000	Yep.
5435000	5436000	Yeah.
5436000	5437000	We're downloading.
5437000	5438000	I want to get your thoughts on this.
5438000	5439000	You're 18.
5439000	5440000	Your mind is unsullied by...
5440000	5443000	I've benefited so far from hearing your recaps of stuff.
5443000	5446000	I want to get as much as I can before you leave.
5446000	5450000	So what else is going on, Christoperg?
5450000	5453000	Last I remember, Spizbulb was not very fond of Father Tinder.
5453000	5454000	He was very suspicious.
5454000	5457000	I think we should try to find out what he knows.
5457000	5461000	And he did not want us to go to the constabulary.
5461000	5462000	Yeah.
5462000	5463000	Right?
5463000	5464000	Yeah.
5464000	5466000	So maybe there's something suspicious there, and we should ask him what's happening there
5466000	5467000	that he knows of.
5467000	5468000	Right.
5468000	5469000	But the Spiz...
5469000	5472000	I mean, Spizbulb was...
5472000	5475000	I mean, I don't know who was fake and who wasn't.
5475000	5478000	There was a Spizbulb we made friends with.
5478000	5481000	And then there was a guy who turned out to be Spizbulb, but he wasn't Spizbulb.
5481000	5483000	He turned out to be Father Tinder.
5483000	5487000	Father Tinder was fake, made of jello back at his place.
5487000	5488000	Yeah.
5488000	5492000	What I originally thought was that maybe Spizbulb was that as a replacement.
5492000	5493000	He was the body there.
5493000	5496000	But it was a magic thing, so I don't think he was.
5496000	5497000	But maybe.
5497000	5499000	So we should try to find him, and that will solve that problem.
5499000	5502000	Find Spizbulb, the actual person.
5502000	5503000	See if we can.
5503000	5506000	We got to go to his place, because that's the place we haven't been yet.
5506000	5507000	You're right.
5507000	5508000	Okay.
5508000	5509000	That's where we're headed.
5509000	5510000	Good.
5510000	5511000	You are headed there.
5511000	5512000	Yeah.
5512000	5517000	Before you can get there, you hear the familiar crunch of tires on gravel,
5517000	5518000	and you see...
5521000	5522000	That was Dino.
5522000	5523000	That was Dino.
5523000	5524000	Good job, dude.
5524000	5525000	He's back on board.
5525000	5526000	I can do sound effects.
5526000	5527000	He loves it.
5527000	5529000	I'm getting into this, motherfucking thing.
5529000	5530000	Yeah, he loves it.
5530000	5531000	I can do sound effects.
5531000	5532000	Yeah.
5532000	5534000	Spizbulb rolls up in his wheelchair.
5534000	5535000	He's like...
5539000	5540000	Wait, what was his voice?
5540000	5541000	Hey, guys.
5542000	5543000	Oh, that voice.
5545000	5547000	You had to draw from your well of...
5550000	5551000	Well.
5551000	5553000	Can Spizbulb talk to the baby for a second?
5555000	5556000	The baby?
5556000	5557000	I don't see a baby.
5557000	5558000	Yeah, I don't see a baby.
5558000	5559000	Okay.
5559000	5560000	Wait, wait, wait.
5560000	5561000	We had him when we left.
5561000	5563000	Oh, we didn't tell him to flee with us.
5563000	5564000	Wait.
5564000	5565000	No, we had him.
5565000	5566000	Do we have the baby?
5566000	5567000	He's there.
5567000	5568000	He's there.
5568000	5569000	You just heard him.
5569000	5570000	All right.
5570000	5571000	Spizbulb, what the fuck?
5572000	5573000	What the fuck?
5573000	5574000	Spizbulb's nice.
5574000	5575000	No.
5575000	5580000	A guy pretending to be you just blew up Father Tinder, but also Father Tinder's fake.
5581000	5583000	Why is that what the fuck to me?
5583000	5586000	I mean, it sounds completely unrelated to anything I've done.
5588000	5589000	All right.
5589000	5590000	You protest too much.
5590000	5591000	Do I?
5591000	5592000	Yeah, you do.
5592000	5593000	Do I really?
5593000	5594000	Yes.
5595000	5596000	Yes.
5597000	5601000	In a world where people are pretending to be other people, what the fuck is going on?
5601000	5606000	In a world where people pretend to be other people, why do you think I'm soliciting people
5606000	5608000	to pretend to be me?
5608000	5611000	That seems like the work of some person who's against me.
5611000	5613000	I'm saying it's natural for me to see.
5613000	5614000	Is it?
5616000	5620000	To see anyone and say, what the fuck is going on?
5620000	5622000	I would expect you to say that to me.
5622000	5624000	Wait, in what circumstance?
5625000	5630000	If you went off on an adventure where I was pretending to be someone else and you saw
5630000	5634000	a version of me going, oogly-boogly, I would expect the next time you saw me.
5634000	5639000	I don't expect you to punish me, but I expect you to say, what the fuck to me?
5639000	5641000	I guess that's one way you can think of it.
5641000	5645000	I definitely wouldn't bend towards that train of thought.
5645000	5649000	Do you remember how I met you?
5649000	5650000	Yeah.
5650000	5651000	Your back was broken.
5651000	5653000	I was getting attacked by orcs and you guys blew up the cart.
5653000	5654000	I healed your back.
5654000	5655000	I healed you.
5655000	5656000	Actually, the clerics did.
5656000	5658000	Once you dragged me, it hurt very much.
5658000	5664000	I dragged you back to the city so that you could get medical attention.
5664000	5665000	And I appreciate it.
5665000	5666000	You're a friend.
5666000	5669000	I'm saying to you, what the fuck?
5669000	5671000	There's people pretending to be you.
5671000	5676000	I'm saying, if someone just came up to me with a mask that looked like you, I wouldn't
5676000	5678000	go questioning you.
5678000	5680000	Where are masks being made of you?
5680000	5683000	I would say, someone's making a mask of this guy.
5683000	5686000	That's crazy.
5686000	5690000	I mean, that's just me.
5690000	5693000	I guess you're just more sophisticated.
5693000	5697000	You wouldn't even never check back in with me because it seems like I would be a clue
5697000	5698000	on that trail.
5698000	5699000	Why are they making masks of you?
5699000	5700000	I don't know.
5700000	5705000	That seems like something you'd ask someone who is actually involved in the plan.
5705000	5711000	You don't think I just finished running around trying to figure out the situation from every
5711000	5712000	other angle?
5712000	5713000	I don't know what you did.
5713000	5714000	Exactly.
5714000	5716000	I finally catch up with that.
5716000	5718000	You catch up to them.
5718000	5723000	Sharpie, I feel like I wasn't as honest as I could have been with the authorities.
5723000	5728000	I'm a little mixed up about what's going on.
5728000	5732000	Maybe Christopher can tell me what's happening.
5732000	5734000	Chris Filleran.
5734000	5737000	We've just met up with Spizbulb.
5737000	5739000	Sharpie is being very defensive right now.
5739000	5744000	Are you kidding me?
5744000	5746000	Incredible.
5746000	5747000	Yeah, I can see that.
5747000	5748000	All right.
5748000	5751000	Okay, fine.
5751000	5756000	Spizbulb, we know that earlier in the day that you did not trust Father Tinder.
5756000	5758000	Yeah, he can't be trusted.
5758000	5762000	Do you have any evidence to that that could help us on our quest to find out why he intimidated you?
5762000	5764000	He doesn't like alcohol.
5764000	5767000	Oh, yeah, that's right.
5767000	5771000	Is that your only basis of hate and mistrust?
5771000	5773000	Do you guys like alcohol?
5773000	5774000	Of course.
5774000	5775000	I like it at weddings.
5775000	5776000	Exactly.
5776000	5781000	Isn't it weird that he doesn't?
5781000	5782000	Is it?
5782000	5783000	Yeah.
5783000	5788000	I mean, other weird things include his replacement with an ice golem.
5788000	5791000	It's a lot of weird stuff.
5791000	5794000	It's hard to know where to start from.
5794000	5795000	No, but I see.
5795000	5796000	It is weird.
5796000	5800000	It is weird to like juice more than to like juice so much.
5800000	5801000	Yeah.
5801000	5802000	But it's strange.
5802000	5804000	We were all put off by his health care.
5804000	5805000	That's what I'm saying.
5805000	5806000	He's suspicious.
5806000	5807000	He's a bad guy.
5807000	5808000	Right?
5808000	5809000	Okay, so.
5809000	5811000	So why are you questioning why I think that?
5811000	5814000	Why are you so defensive and why am I the one that's confusing?
5814000	5819000	Can I just say for a second that you two are very cute together.
5819000	5820000	I realize this is not about that.
5820000	5826000	And I don't know how you orient, but it is sweet, sweet pairing.
5826000	5828000	Your Danny Glover, Mel Gibson.
5828000	5830000	We got to find a closer to this thing.
5830000	5831000	I mean, we're going to.
5831000	5832000	Yeah.
5832000	5833000	Am I supposed to do that?
5833000	5834000	I don't know.
5834000	5836000	I don't know if I want to know you.
5836000	5838000	I am the ender.
5838000	5840000	Maybe if the room just starts.
5840000	5841000	Oh my God.
5841000	5842000	There's a way.
5842000	5846000	I am ending this podcast.
5846000	5847000	Oh no.
5848000	5850000	I'm eating all of you.
5853000	5854000	He's choking.
5854000	5856000	Good night, everybody.
5856000	5857000	Come on.
5857000	5858000	That's not.
5858000	5862000	No, that's like if your dad came in and just kicked your toys away.
5862000	5863000	That's not.
5863000	5867000	I'll do anything to get over this.
5867000	5872000	It'll happen soon enough and your life is not that hard.
5872000	5877000	What is, what is a bit of advice we can get from, from Kayleen for the rest of
5877000	5878000	our lives?
5878000	5880000	What, what, what is the meaning of life?
5880000	5882000	That's not going to close the show.
5882000	5883000	I don't know.
5883000	5884000	Maybe it is.
5884000	5885000	Recycle.
5886000	5888000	You're all on the same team.
5888000	5892000	Research palm oil and how it's bad for the orangutans.
5892000	5893000	Oh.
5893000	5894000	Yeah.
5894000	5895000	That's not.
5897000	5899000	That's got to be the end.
5899000	5901000	That is a fake ending.
5902000	5903000	I don't doubt for a second.
5903000	5905000	Paul mile is important.
5905000	5907000	This is harmontown to the movie.
5907000	5908000	Come on Spencer.
5908000	5909000	All right.
5909000	5910000	Come on.
5910000	5911000	What?
5911000	5914000	I run up to the matrix of finality.
5914000	5916000	What is that's just like what Dino did.
5916000	5917000	I mean.
5917000	5918000	All right.
5918000	5919000	You're right.
5919000	5920000	You're right.
5920000	5921000	You're right.
5921000	5922000	It's fine.
5922000	5923000	It's fine.
5923000	5924000	All right.
5924000	5925000	Well, we'll just.
5925000	5926000	Okay.
5926000	5928000	I run into the street.
5928000	5929000	All right.
5929000	5930000	You run into the street.
5930000	5931000	Like.
5933000	5934000	Meep meep.
5935000	5936000	You have.
5936000	5937000	Fuck you.
5937000	5938000	Get out of the way.
5939000	5940000	And I go.
5940000	5941000	Why.
5941000	5942000	Why.
5943000	5944000	And I start.
5944000	5945000	I start.
5945000	5948000	I start kind of flailing around like I'm not going to.
5948000	5951000	I don't want to hurt anybody but I'm flailing around.
5951000	5952000	Why.
5952000	5953000	Why.
5953000	5954000	I run out.
5954000	5956000	I run out after him.
5956000	5958000	I sit back and watch.
5959000	5960000	I'm not.
5960000	5961000	I'm not made out of tongue here.
5961000	5962000	Why.
5963000	5964000	He's.

6063640	6069600	You said it started lower though.
6069600	6074960	Oh okay.
6074960	6088160	The most literate city with all of the books.
6088160	6090660	The space needle tubs.
6090660	6102660	The two are slow, you're a city on the sea.
6102660	6119660	A town for you and me great Seattle fishermen come home to shore.
6120660	6130660	And the football team plays and the towers go to gray.
6130660	6141660	All the rain and the grunge will come forth.
6142660	6161660	But the mayor of Seattle always feels all the cow when you live and you love in the gorse.
6161660	6163660	Your Mayor Dan Harmon.
6163660	6164660	Thank you for coming out.
