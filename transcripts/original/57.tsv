0	22000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, I am Bobcat Goldwain and I am your guest composer today.
22000	38000	Jerry, yes, I'd like to apologize to the ladies who are here for Jeff, but it's me, Bob Scratch Goldwain.
38000	44000	And now hear ye, hear ye, Harmontown is now in session.
52000	61000	Here's the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
61000	65000	You were waiting for your name.
65000	68000	I didn't even know it was possible for you to do it wrong.
68000	70000	I didn't.
70000	74000	You are Poplob's mayor.
74000	79000	No, I did mess that up, but I stood there for a second.
79000	81000	We made eye contact.
81000	85000	What am I waiting for? My name is the show anyway.
85000	87000	It's right there.
87000	91000	I know the mayor. Who's the mayor?
91000	96000	I said Harmontown, but is it Town? Is that his name?
96000	101000	Please welcome Robert Town, the mayor of Harmontown.
101000	103000	I wrote Chinatown.
103000	105000	Yes, you did.
106000	111000	Welcome, Bob Count. Thank you for filling in for Jeff.
111000	115000	You'll find comp trolling is as easy as falling off a log.
115000	117000	Well, I'm a little nervous.
117000	123000	Now, by the time you got to the G's in your Rolodex, who said no?
123000	129000	Or did you go by the first name? It was just Al, weird Al said no, and then it was Bob.
129000	134000	No, I swear. I mean, you're a fan favorite to citizens of the town.
134000	136000	Oh, that's nice.
138000	140000	I don't have Robin Williams number.
140000	146000	No, but I have a little bit like a hobo that jumped off a train in Harmontown.
146000	148000	Yeah, I wasn't really invited.
148000	150000	I shamed Ken for a hat.
150000	154000	Or you're like the town drunk that sleeps in the open, the unlocked cell, you know?
154000	156000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
156000	158000	He comes and goes as he pleases.
158000	160000	Otis!
160000	170000	Speaking of which, I just, I got to shave this beard and get a haircut because I just realized today, looking in the mirror, and maybe this is something only you and I will understand.
170000	172000	I'm starting to look like Uncle Jesse from Duke's acid.
172000	174000	Right around, man.
174000	176000	You know, it's weird you say this.
176000	180000	When I saw you tonight, I thought, I thought you look good. I really did.
180000	185000	I was a little jealous. I said, I wish I, one, could grow a head of hair.
185000	190000	And also, I can't grow hair right here. Like, I need a merkin for my sideburns.
190000	194000	It's just, oh yeah. Different people have different problems.
194000	203000	What I can't do is something that Spencer can do, get that ZZ Top thing going, where your beard gets longer as time goes.
203000	205000	That's where Simon's power is.
205000	208000	Mine just kind of galleries out like a cloud.
209000	219000	I'm flattering myself by that comparison even because it's just like random hairs will just like send out tendrils and then I try to take a beard trimmer and it just does that.
219000	225000	I'm tired of the whole mess. I got to get off this train, this crazy beard, fat, long hair train.
225000	228000	So next week you're going to be without beard?
228000	230000	I don't know.
231000	236000	You play like this weird shell game with your fat face underneath of the beard.
238000	242000	Or an advent calendar. I don't know what's under there.
242000	245000	I don't know if I'm going to get a chocolate coin.
245000	252000	I have a feeling I'm going to look like Jerry Mathers when they did the return to leave it to the beavers.
252000	257000	Is that the beaver? Did he eat beaver? Who is that?
258000	261000	That sounded way dirtier than I wanted.
262000	269000	This is interesting. We're touching upon manorexia, body issues with men who are overweight.
269000	272000	I was going to say chubby, but that was a little too adorable.
275000	277000	I'm wearing this shirt.
277000	278000	Husky.
278000	280000	My mother, did you ever buy Husky pants?
280000	283000	No, I wasn't Husky when I was still shopping with my mom.
283000	284000	Yeah, I was a fat kid.
284000	287000	I was gangly. I looked like Ralph Macchio at that age.
287000	290000	I actually still shop with my mom. That's why.
290000	292000	I still look like Ralph Macchio.
292000	298000	My mother would take me to get the Huskies at Sears. That's what they call the fat pants.
298000	300000	I don't know if they still have Huskies.
300000	304000	I think they finally figured out somewhere between the n-word and retarded.
304000	308000	They figured out that Husky was bad. That it was part of the problem.
308000	310000	In a funeral, for the word Husky.
311000	313000	Mother, why am I wearing dog pants?
317000	321000	My mother would lose her shit about an hour into finding pants for her.
321000	325000	I was basically Bobby Hill, this fat little boy.
325000	328000	She would go, you're not fat. You're a Husky.
328000	332000	Then when none of them would fit, she's like, I'm going to take you to the tent department.
332000	333000	Actual quote.
334000	336000	She'd jump cut. I'm on stage.
337000	340000	You know, I think that describes all...
342000	346000	You know, I think, where do you get that nutty character from?
346000	349000	My mother said that you should wear tents.
350000	353000	There's two things I wanted to talk about with that nutty character.
353000	360000	One is, when you became famous, your name was Bobcat Goldthwaite.
360000	362000	You came out and you would go...
364000	366000	Which sounds like a bobcat.
366000	368000	Oh, no, no, no. That wasn't the connection.
370000	373000	See, this is great to finally have this...
373000	375000	You thought way more about it than I did.
375000	377000	Was that just an old nickname, Bobcat?
377000	381000	Yeah, Bobcat. I became Bobcat when I was about 15.
381000	385000	I'll try to do a quick version of the story, because I do get asked that sometimes.
385000	387000	The host of your...
387000	389000	If you hear Jeff's stories, you don't have...
389000	391000	Oh, okay. But this has an end.
393000	395000	No, so when I was...
395000	399000	I started doing comedy when I was 15, 16 years old, around that age.
399000	403000	Tom Kenny, who I don't want to name drop, but he's spongy about square pants.
403000	405000	I've known him since I was six.
405000	406000	Oh, really?
406000	407000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
407000	409000	And so we grew up together at Catholic school.
409000	411000	We started doing comedy at a local open mic night.
411000	416000	A very funny comedian, Barry Crimmins, comes in and he announces that he's Bearcat now.
416000	418000	And that we're gonna introduce him as Bearcat.
418000	421000	And us being sarcastic little pricks, both go,
421000	423000	Oh, that's funny. They call me Tomcat.
423000	425000	And I'm like, oh, I'm Bobcat.
425000	426000	He's just like, really?
426000	428000	But you killed that night, so it's stuck forever.
428000	429000	Well, yeah, that's...
429000	430000	You're afraid to shake your audience.
430000	431000	Exactly.
431000	435000	No, no, the problem is, the punchline is, they're Barry and Tom, and I'm Bobcat.
435000	437000	It's like, yeah, I really gave it to him.
437000	440000	I'm 15 now, and I'm Bobcat, you know.
440000	442000	But it's easier to stick with Bobcat.
442000	445000	Listen to people mangle golf weight, you know.
445000	446000	I always...
446000	449000	Because when I met you then, when I...
449000	451000	Well, I told the story of...
451000	453000	Shrav and I met you in Milwaukee.
453000	458000	And you were still Bobcat Goldthwaite, but you were, at least that night, you were...
458000	460000	Had an ass load of it.
460000	463000	Well, you were talking normal.
463000	464000	You weren't doing the character.
464000	469000	And you also were, like, inspiringly jaded.
469000	473000	We're not having any of what my hometown was giving you
473000	477000	in terms of talk back and reception.
477000	481000	We're saying these really amazing, smart, cynical things.
481000	485000	But I think you were still calling yourself...
485000	486000	But you might not have been.
486000	487000	I thought...
487000	490000	My perception was that at one point, if you were famous for being Bobcat Goldthwaite,
490000	497000	that then, if one decade turned into another, then when you meet that person again,
497000	502000	you'd expect them to want to be called Bob or Robert or Octavius or something.
502000	503000	Right.
503000	507000	But I thought that's because you were called Bobcat because the character was...
507000	512000	Rawr! I'm Bobcat Goldthwaite! Rawr! I'm a tiger! Rawr!
512000	513000	And I was way off base.
513000	518000	That sounded like the guy who was the gatekeeper in The Wizard of Oz.
518000	523000	Rawr! Rawr! The wizard's not here!
523000	525000	No, no, no. I never gave it that much thought.
525000	527000	I was Bobcat, actually, before the persona.
527000	531000	Most of my close friends call me Bobcat, but my family doesn't.
531000	534000	My daughter, on purpose, will be in a mall and go,
534000	538000	look, that's Bobcat, just to make my skin crawl.
538000	540000	But yeah, I don't think too much about it.
540000	545000	I don't want to be Ricky Schroeder, who I'm now Rick.
545000	548000	And people will go, oh, please. You are in Police Academy.
548000	550000	Now you want to be taken seriously.
550000	553000	So I don't think too much about it.
553000	555000	I'm comfortable with Bobcats.
555000	560000	Speaking of which, there's a story that Shrob told me that I think you must have told to him.
560000	569000	It sounds like a sad story, but your sad stories are really funny.
569000	573000	You would cut me off if you either don't want to tell the story
573000	576000	or start telling it if you know what I'm talking about.
576000	579000	Robin Williams was going to be in some commercial,
579000	582000	and he said to the people shooting the commercial off.
582000	585000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So he called me up and he goes,
585000	588000	you know, they're going to make you do the voice.
588000	590000	And he said, like, Robin said, I'll only do it if like...
590000	593000	Yeah, he brought me on board. He got me money.
593000	597000	Basically, Robin's a nice man and got me a nice paycheck
597000	600000	and took care of my back taxes.
600000	603000	And he said, yeah, I want Bobcat in it.
603000	606000	And then he's like, you know, I'll only do it if he...
606000	609000	And they call me up and they go, you know, you're going to have to do the voice.
609000	612000	Like, he's giving me a heads up, you know, it'd be nice.
612000	615000	And I said, for the amount of money they're paying me,
615000	619000	I will fuck a Snickers bar.
619000	621000	It was a Snickers commercial.
621000	623000	And when I say that, yeah, and when I say that, people go,
623000	625000	how do you fuck a Snickers bar?
625000	627000	Well, see, I didn't even blink at that.
627000	629000	That's how small my dick is. I was like, yeah.
629000	633000	I was like, oh, that'll just put a small discreet hole in the Snickers bar.
633000	635000	I guess I should have said...
635000	637000	I could fill it with more nougat.
637000	640000	That was grosser than I wanted it to be.
640000	642000	That wasn't a cum joke.
642000	644000	Or you...
644000	649000	I guess I saw it going up my ass, honestly.
649000	651000	My first thought was I have a pencil dick
651000	654000	and your first thought was you fucking putting things up your ass.
654000	657000	I'm more comfortable with the gay part of my...
657000	659000	No, but here's the thing.
659000	662000	There's a caveat with the Mars Corporation that I really...
662000	664000	Oh, you can't...
664000	669000	By the way, that doesn't mean I don't like Snickers.
669000	674000	I'm just saying that maybe one of my ass would be nice.
674000	677000	We're suggesting other ways that it satisfies.
677000	679000	Did you make me really...
683000	684000	And there's guys...
684000	686000	This is typical me.
686000	689000	Here's some money. All right. You got to give it back.
689000	691000	They said to me...
691000	695000	I had a short meeting when they're going,
695000	699000	you know, there's this thing where if you get involved in a scandal
699000	703000	or if you do something that's offensive or outrageous,
703000	705000	you have to give the money back.
705000	710000	And I said, well, I can't imagine something like that ever happening.
715000	719000	Did you ever hear that people have no idea who they're dealing with?
719000	722000	I couldn't imagine anything like that happening.
722000	727000	Did you ever hear this L.A. legend about...
729000	731000	Who's the guy that created all the game shows?
731000	732000	Griffeth.
732000	733000	Merv Griffin.
733000	734000	Merv Griffin.
734000	735000	Yeah, Merv Griffin.
735000	736000	When you hear...
736000	739000	Merv Griffin would fit on this show.
741000	743000	When you hear the words Merv Griffin and Candy Bar,
743000	746000	does anything come into your head that you ever heard?
746000	748000	No, no.
748000	751000	For some reason when I first got to L.A.,
752000	755000	I actually know who the someone is,
755000	760000	so I'm not going to say his name because I don't want anyone calling him
760000	762000	for confirmation.
762000	764000	But he pointed at the...
764000	765000	We were driving down this street,
765000	767000	he pointed at this one distinct building.
767000	769000	It's like this circular building.
769000	772000	It's like a house, like a big circular house on a hill,
772000	776000	something that's kind of prominent in the L.A. scenery.
776000	780000	And he said, you know, they say that Merv Griffin lives up there
780000	784000	and that he eats candy bars out of a little boy's butt.
784000	786000	Just asking if he would ever...
786000	788000	I mean, it was so random,
788000	791000	and I was like, I guess that's the secret of urban legend.
791000	793000	Will he be remembered for the hours of enjoyment
793000	795000	he supplied America on television?
795000	797000	No.
797000	799000	And I was like, is that why the house is round?
799000	801000	So that they can... I don't know, it's like an arena?
801000	803000	Or are they like...
805000	808000	But then I realized if you really wanted to,
808000	810000	you know, it should be like a triangle,
810000	812000	like maximize the corners, you know.
815000	818000	And then that's how that becomes an urban legend
818000	820000	because it's just interesting.
820000	822000	You've got to pass it on because it's so specific.
822000	824000	Somebody out there tries to make a believable urban legend,
824000	828000	like, hey, did you hear Robert Downey Jr.
828000	830000	did some coke last night?
830000	832000	And no one spreads it, you know?
832000	834000	No one cares.
834000	836000	So you've got to do something really specific
836000	837000	with something really specific.
837000	839000	But we're a weird culture because, like,
839000	843000	these urban legends, because if you don't address them,
843000	845000	people just accept them as true.
845000	847000	Like the Richard Gere thing.
847000	849000	Yeah, I mean, I really wish Richard Gere
849000	852000	would go on a talk show and say,
852000	856000	look, I never had a hamster in my ass, you know?
856000	858000	Just go look at this face.
858000	861000	Do you really think I'm that bored with pussy?
862000	865000	Yeah, you guys are putting a hamster in your ass
865000	867000	before Richard Gere does.
867000	870000	Or are you looking at it the other way, though?
870000	873000	He'd be bored of pussy sooner and wear it out.
873000	875000	Well, sometimes, like, rock stars, I think,
875000	878000	Tom Kenny had this theory that they're like the immortals,
878000	879000	you know what I mean?
879000	881000	And they get bored with, you know what I mean?
881000	884000	Because there's a picture of Brando with a wiener in his mouth.
884000	887000	And his explanation of it, I think he said it one time.
887000	889000	He's like, yeah, I was just like,
889000	892000	because he was at the height of his fucking dominance of everything.
892000	895000	And it's like, after a while, I'm sure, you know,
895000	898000	DiCaprio and McGuire probably go like, hey, man,
898000	900000	you thinking what I'm thinking?
900000	903000	We're the only two people we haven't fucked yet.
903000	907000	Let's go in the bathroom and set a record.
907000	909000	It's just a numbers game?
909000	912000	Or just like an Everest game, you know?
912000	917000	It's just like walking over the frozen bodies of every supermodel in the world
917000	920000	and going like, this is, you know, you're not invited.
920000	922000	I'm bored.
922000	925000	I'm so bored of pussy.
925000	926000	Is that Droopy?
926000	927000	That's Droopy dog.
927000	928000	He got a lot of talent.
928000	931000	And he eventually, he fucked Yosemite Sam.
931000	935000	Like, I only took out enough to win.
935000	936000	Yee-haw.
936000	938000	I'm not going to do Yosemite Sam.
938000	940000	I say, I say boy.
940000	943000	No, he fucked five more and let go on.
943000	945000	I say, I say boy.
946000	949000	What are you doing with that erection?
949000	951000	But you know what?
951000	954000	Never in the rumor mill, Clooney.
954000	955000	Yeah.
955000	960000	Because he's trying to achieve Clooney.
960000	963000	We want him, he's like Cary Grant or whatever he fits,
963000	966000	he's that tarot card that we reserved for one guy.
966000	970000	He fixed a paparazzi's tire.
970000	971000	Come on, man.
971000	974000	How can you be that zen, that perfect?
974000	979000	Every time he's in the news, it's like he tipped a lemonade stand $100.
979000	980000	You know what I mean?
980000	982000	We're going to find out when he, you know,
982000	987000	he's got to have like a trap door under a carpet in his house.
987000	990000	There's got to be some dudes down there or something.
990000	993000	No, man, I don't want anything bad about Clooney.
993000	997000	I want to believe there's one person without,
997000	1001000	although the political right, the conservative groups hate him.
1001000	1004000	Oh, because he's outspoken and progressive.
1004000	1006000	Yeah, which is just so insane.
1006000	1009000	You know, all the, that whole, you know,
1009000	1011000	when I made the movie Goblet's America,
1011000	1014000	there'd be a lot of conservative types that would be so angry at the movie
1014000	1017000	and not seen it or they just needed it for fodder.
1017000	1018000	You know what I mean?
1018000	1020000	It's not reality, you know?
1020000	1023000	I didn't say you couldn't make a movie where,
1023000	1026000	I don't know who was the Bill O'Reilly type that got shot in the face.
1026000	1029000	Didn't one of the Zucker brothers like make like the world's first
1029000	1031000	conservative comedy?
1031000	1035000	And I was like, why is all comedy like so liberal and stuff?
1035000	1039000	And he made like a parody of Michael Moore and it was like, yeah,
1039000	1042000	he's doing bits in it that are like Zucker brothers bits.
1042000	1046000	But they're, the joke is that, you know,
1046000	1051000	9-11 is going to happen again if we don't stay on our guard.
1051000	1055000	Like, why do you think comedy is liberal?
1055000	1058000	Because we need to fucking relax.
1059000	1063000	Why do this conservatism doesn't lend itself to comedy?
1063000	1065000	But the other thing is, is like,
1065000	1068000	Michael Moore has a huge sense of self-parody.
1068000	1071000	You know, it's not like, he's not like a guy that doesn't, you know,
1071000	1074000	who isn't the first one to crack wise about himself.
1074000	1077000	It's like, we got to take that clown down a couple of matches.
1077000	1081000	I mean, it's never going to work if you're, yeah, not coming from that side.
1081000	1082000	It's just too much.
1082000	1084000	I mean, I'm sure there's some, there's very funny,
1084000	1087000	certainly there's very smart people who also happen to be politically right leaning,
1087000	1092000	but just in general, there's two, those two things don't traditionally mesh.
1092000	1097000	And I think there's a, there's the, there's just this weird thing.
1097000	1101000	Like when Clint Eastwood went up and talked to the chair,
1101000	1104000	that bit, it wasn't a sign of a guy being crazy.
1104000	1106000	That bit just wasn't written for me.
1106000	1108000	It wasn't written for progressive liberal types.
1108000	1109000	It was like, you know,
1109000	1113000	he was making fun of people that people,
1113000	1115000	I didn't see it as a guy who was nuts.
1115000	1118000	I just thought, oh, these jokes aren't for me.
1118000	1119000	He knew his audience.
1119000	1120000	He wasn't babbling.
1120000	1121000	He wasn't insane.
1121000	1122000	And it killed there.
1122000	1123000	And you know, and it didn't kill there,
1123000	1126000	but they were really mad that he didn't go out there and just go make my day.
1126000	1128000	They're like, you're a conservative.
1128000	1130000	You're just supposed to say your catchphrases.
1130000	1132000	Come on, say hasta la vista, baby.
1132000	1136000	That's what a conservative, you know, you're supposed to say that I'll be back.
1136000	1139000	You're not supposed to go up there and do a bit.
1139000	1141000	So I actually defend him.
1141000	1143000	I think he's a very bright man.
1143000	1145000	It's just those jokes weren't for me.
1145000	1147000	Yeah, I reckon you're right.
1147000	1151000	I don't know.
1151000	1152000	Politics.
1152000	1155000	I hear you.
1155000	1159000	Back to Husky body issues.
1159000	1160000	Back to me.
1160000	1165000	I saw a first cut of my documentary,
1165000	1168000	the documentary about Harmon Town.
1168000	1172000	And my big takeaway is I had no idea how fat my hands are.
1173000	1177000	I was like the whole time I'm looking at my big fat face with my stupid scraggly beard
1177000	1182000	and my bags under my eyes and my yeah, I knew I was thinning back there.
1182000	1183000	And then I don't.
1183000	1184000	Yeah, it's weird posture.
1184000	1188000	I walk like a train circus bear.
1188000	1192000	I make these weird aloof expressions when I'm actually thinking and feeling.
1192000	1193000	Thank you, sir.
1193000	1194000	And then and madam.
1194000	1196000	And then get the look on my face.
1196000	1201000	Looks like I want people to die and weird fucking disorders facially.
1201000	1205000	And all of this I knew when I when I take off my shirt,
1205000	1209000	I know I look like Ron Jeremy or George the animal steel,
1209000	1214000	but but but but but if he only ever wrestled Twinkies
1214000	1219000	and won every time undefeated.
1219000	1224000	But but I never knew because there's all these shots of me typing because I'm a writer
1224000	1230000	and and it's like close ups of my hands and shots of angles of me with my hands in front of me typing.
1230000	1236000	I have these little Gerber baby hands, these little like little doll hands
1236000	1238000	and like these short fat fingers.
1238000	1243000	I I always thought that that that that from my perspective,
1243000	1247000	I think it's because the fingers disappear into the distance as I'm looking at them.
1247000	1250000	I always pictured that from your perspective,
1250000	1254000	I would look like a like a like a cool wizard when I was typing.
1254000	1257000	I just look like a little little baby hamster,
1257000	1262000	like just just just poking at the keys with my little baby carrot fingers.
1262000	1265000	It looks like I'm just filled with vodka and I'm just like,
1265000	1267000	like if you poked one of the ends of my fingers,
1267000	1271000	there'd just be this little stream and shoot out like a vodka sprinkler,
1271000	1274000	like a surgical glove when you fill it with.
1274000	1277000	So you didn't realize you had chubby baby hands.
1277000	1279000	Yeah, a little tiny baby.
1279000	1282000	I can't remember what I I think it's the vanity is really funny.
1282000	1284000	Like I'm diagnosed with pre-diabetes.
1284000	1285000	I'm not going to lose weight.
1285000	1286000	I see myself on something.
1286000	1288000	I'm like, man, you're fat, B.C.
1288000	1290000	You got to take a couple of LPs off.
1290000	1295000	Like I recently lost 20 pounds because I saw myself like on something.
1295000	1298000	Yeah, I well, I've definitely I'm going to shave the beard and I'm going to
1298000	1300000	and I got to take it easy on the drinking.
1300000	1303000	Don't you think the beard slenderizes?
1303000	1309000	Well, it's just I mean, in the sense that a giant shrub slenderizes
1309000	1314000	a big fat monster behind it by making less of it visible.
1314000	1318000	I mean, but you're not really fooling anybody.
1318000	1319000	It's not.
1319000	1324000	I mean, I my my wife, the 09 will not allow me to grow a beard.
1324000	1325000	I don't know why.
1325000	1329000	Well, it's probably I mean, I will don't women generally.
1329000	1332000	I mean, Erin, Erin likes the beard.
1332000	1334000	I think I finally found her limits and stuff.
1334000	1336000	But I mean, she's the exception.
1336000	1340000	Like a lot of a lot of women like I thought they like the little baby face.
1340000	1343000	I don't know why she won't let me have facial hair.
1343000	1344000	Do I sound whipped?
1344000	1346000	No, do do.
1346000	1349000	There's a glass ceiling in this country.
1349000	1352000	Give her give her something.
1352000	1354000	You can't make as much as me.
1354000	1355000	Yeah.
1355000	1356000	So I won't be here.
1356000	1357000	Seventy percent of you.
1357000	1358000	That's good.
1358000	1359000	Same work.
1359000	1360000	She was sitting there.
1360000	1362000	She would 70 percent of nothing.
1362000	1364000	She would have to pay to be here.
1364000	1367000	She'd have to give me some of that water.
1367000	1370000	So she that's why she gets me with.
1370000	1371000	Yeah, I don't know what.
1371000	1372000	Yeah.
1372000	1376000	But I think her thing is that she is a fear that I would be a 50 year old guy trying to
1376000	1378000	look like I was a hipster.
1378000	1379000	I think.
1379000	1380000	Yeah.
1380000	1381000	Well, there's that fear.
1381000	1382000	Yeah.
1382000	1383000	That's why.
1383000	1384000	That's why I think I'm going to.
1384000	1385000	Yeah.
1385000	1388000	I just I went to a friend's 40th birthday yesterday.
1388000	1392000	And because it was one of those, you know, parties where you hire one bartender and there's
1392000	1395000	like a little tiny bar and there's like 50 people there.
1395000	1398000	I was like, this isn't this isn't going to work for me.
1398000	1400000	So I went to the liquor store down the street.
1400000	1404000	And I and I bought a fifth of Kettle one.
1404000	1407000	And and then I was like, well, what am I supposed to do with it because I'm just going to become
1407000	1408000	a second bartender.
1408000	1412000	If I put it down, people are going to come up and like start making screwdrivers with
1412000	1413000	it.
1413000	1414000	And I'm going to be going crazy.
1414000	1416000	I can't keep it in my pocket because it's a fifth.
1416000	1417000	They didn't have flash size.
1417000	1420000	So I really crossed a threshold.
1420000	1425000	I kept saying this is the second milestone in my biopic with the way I.
1425000	1429000	Long story short, I just took the cap off and I was just walking around a party with
1429000	1431000	the vodka.
1431000	1433000	And at the end of that party, it was empty.
1433000	1436000	Like it was a milkshake or something.
1436000	1437000	And I was fine.
1437000	1438000	Kind of.
1438000	1440000	I mean, I got a huge, huge fight with my girlfriend.
1440000	1443000	So I went and had another drink somewhere else.
1443000	1447000	And it was like midnight and I bought some dill taco and I probably could have killed
1447000	1448000	11 people.
1448000	1454000	And I I watched Inglorious Bastards or rather that's what was on when I woke up on the
1454000	1458000	sofa and and then apologize to my girlfriend because I was like lightheaded.
1458000	1463000	And I like I drank probably a half a gallon of vodka.
1463000	1464000	And it didn't really.
1464000	1468000	I other people will pass out or puke before they die of alcohol poisoning.
1468000	1472000	I'm one of those people that really needs to actually I got to be I got to I got to
1472000	1474000	I got to watch watch my shit a little bit.
1474000	1475000	Right.
1475000	1479000	I'm worried about what people are thinking when you're just taking a pole out of this
1479000	1481000	bottle at a party.
1481000	1483000	Well, what are they going to what's the worst they could think.
1483000	1484000	I think Dan might drink a lot.
1484000	1492000	I mean, that's that ship has sailed at an ocean of something that isn't water.
1492000	1498000	But if you if you use the straw, you would have looked adorable.
1498000	1503000	If you just like a light up one from just loopy straw.
1503000	1505000	Oh, he's doing one of his bits.
1505000	1506000	That guy's always on.
1506000	1509000	I'm going to detox.
1509000	1513000	This is a uncharacteristically sober for this show.
1513000	1516000	I'm a little less nervous than the first time we did the show sober.
1516000	1519000	I'm going to see what the effect of a week is.
1519000	1524000	But I don't I don't like former drinkers and how evangelical and weird and yeah,
1524000	1525000	where they are.
1525000	1528000	But we had we had we had we had Chris Hardwick on the show.
1528000	1529000	He's been sober for a long time.
1529000	1531000	I think you're probably sober.
1531000	1532000	Right.
1532000	1533000	Yeah.
1533000	1534000	People don't know that about me.
1534000	1535000	Right.
1535000	1536000	Because you don't run around.
1536000	1537000	Because I'm a member of sobriety.
1537000	1538000	I am.
1538000	1540000	I'm a member of an anonymous program.
1540000	1542000	That's why they don't know.
1542000	1543000	Sorry.
1543000	1545000	No, no, no, but I'll talk about it now.
1545000	1548000	But I mean, yeah, I stopped drinking and all that when I was 19.
1548000	1552000	I'm kind of glad to at this point because it's 30 years, you know,
1552000	1554000	but I don't think it's an achievement when people get sober.
1554000	1555000	You know what I'm saying?
1555000	1557000	And a lot of people make it their personality.
1557000	1558000	Yeah.
1558000	1561000	And that's as criminal as being drunk and having to have people personality.
1561000	1562000	Exactly.
1562000	1566000	And I just find I actually find sober people super fucking annoying.
1566000	1567000	And I'm sober.
1567000	1568000	Yeah.
1568000	1571000	But I did have a vacation from sobriety because of my bad back.
1571000	1572000	And I was really nervous.
1572000	1573000	And I was really nervous.
1573000	1575000	I joke about that, but I was terrified of it.
1575000	1578000	I really kind of was afraid that this was going to start something.
1578000	1579000	Oh, you were going to.
1579000	1581000	But the weird part of it was I really couldn't wait to get off of it.
1581000	1587000	But but I was really high on stage and at film festivals.
1587000	1589000	And I was going, man, this is awesome.
1589000	1590000	Like, I didn't worry about.
1590000	1593000	Yeah, I think I'm going to I'm going to jump right into weed.
1593000	1594000	Like, I'm not going to.
1594000	1595000	Well, a lot.
1595000	1596000	It is heavy.
1596000	1597000	I mean, that's morphine.
1597000	1600000	I was on the shit that killed my Bruce and I'm up on stage.
1600000	1603000	And I'm going to ask me anything.
1603000	1605000	You know, what do you want to know?
1605000	1607000	How heavy is Pluto?
1607000	1609000	Oh, no.
1609000	1610000	Real heavy, baby.
1610000	1613000	I was like, no, I would talk about anything.
1613000	1614000	You know, hey, yeah.
1614000	1618000	Let's, you know, we're going to talk about Sam Kittinson and your rival.
1618000	1619000	What's it like to bang Nicky Cox?
1619000	1622000	You know, I was just like an open book.
1622000	1623000	Oh, my God.
1623000	1624000	You banged Nicky Cox.
1624000	1626000	Well, when you're engaged, that comes up.
1626000	1627000	Yeah, yeah.
1627000	1628000	It happens.
1628000	1630000	It's like it's not like a period.
1630000	1632000	No, but that's something I always.
1632000	1634000	Where marriage is arranged and you had to pretend you had sex.
1634000	1635000	No, but I would.
1635000	1637000	That was always something that just talking about.
1637000	1640000	I'd be like, you know, recoil, if anyone asked.
1640000	1644000	But when I'm on the lot and my life was an open book.
1644000	1647000	Your audience doesn't appreciate the lot.
1647000	1652000	But someday or you've tried it, you've had it for surgery.
1652000	1655000	Yeah, it's it's it's really weird, isn't it?
1655000	1661000	It's a little bit like ejaculating all day.
1661000	1662000	That's what it was like.
1662000	1664000	I mean, without the face.
1664000	1668000	I mean, I wasn't like, you know, that's the only bad thing about it.
1668000	1669000	That's my sexy face.
1669000	1670000	I had to walk around with it.
1670000	1671000	Oh, my God.
1671000	1674000	You know, he's having a stroke.
1674000	1675000	Someone help me scratch.
1675000	1677000	There's billboards up all over the city of you.
1677000	1680000	Just like with glasses on reading a library book.
1680000	1682000	And it says, I'm ejaculating right now.
1682000	1683000	Yeah.
1683000	1684000	Thanks to you.
1684000	1687000	I don't know if that's a name.
1687000	1693000	I think it is just the general name for this beautiful, beautiful little pill.
1693000	1696000	I'm looking at my Evernote app.
1696000	1699000	OK, more Hollywood gossip.
1699000	1704000	This comes to me from from an unnamed source that claims to have two sources,
1704000	1707000	which makes it an urban legend.
1707000	1714000	Do Jeremy Piven and John Cusack really have a lot of three ways together?
1714000	1715000	I don't know.
1715000	1716000	Wow.
1716000	1717000	I...
1717000	1720000	Jaitline Los Angeles.
1720000	1721000	That's just it.
1721000	1725000	No, I thought they were on the outs, actually.
1725000	1729000	I thought Piv and Cusack don't hang out anymore.
1729000	1731000	That's what I hear.
1731000	1732000	I did a movie.
1732000	1738000	Well, I bet double teaming women probably tests the metal of your friendship.
1738000	1743000	That candle probably burns brightly and quicker.
1743000	1746000	It's being burned at both ends.
1746000	1747000	It's being burned at both ends.
1747000	1751000	Beef fungus bill with the Grand Slam.
1751000	1753000	Sorry, I wasn't doing that to humble you.
1753000	1755000	I was just doing a callback.
1755000	1758000	You don't want people to call you beef fungus bill, do you?
1758000	1759000	Beef fungus bill?
1759000	1761000	He brought some beef and had some fungus out of it.
1761000	1762000	Okay.
1762000	1764000	Did it have any hallucinogenic properties?
1764000	1766000	Wasn't that how they discovered LSD?
1766000	1767000	It was a fungus?
1767000	1771000	We hallucinated before we found the fungus on it that it was okay to eat a stranger's
1771000	1774000	meat at a show that just brought it in paperbacks.
1774000	1777000	Back to eating stranger's meat.
1777000	1779000	I don't believe they had a three-way.
1779000	1780000	I mean, maybe they have.
1780000	1781000	I don't think that's their thing.
1781000	1782000	John is like...
1782000	1785000	The urban legend I heard is that they're constantly...
1785000	1790000	They have sex together, not with each other, but that if you're having sex with one of
1791000	1794000	them, it's like the other guy's there.
1794000	1799000	Because John has actually entered Howard Hughes kind of thing.
1799000	1801000	He's a little like...
1801000	1802000	He's making airplanes?
1802000	1803000	No.
1803000	1804000	He's like...
1804000	1811000	His daily seaweed wraps and he's just kind of little...
1811000	1812000	So, yeah.
1812000	1814000	Do you think he threw it with Jeremy Clippen?
1814000	1819000	I don't think he's really too awesome about germs right now.
1819000	1822000	And people.
1822000	1825000	He kind of jettisoned a lot of friends.
1825000	1829000	I did a movie with him a million years ago called One Crazy Summer.
1829000	1830000	Yeah, you did.
1830000	1832000	And he was very...
1832000	1838000	We were pally and everything, but we were recently talking about doing a follow-up,
1838000	1840000	like One Nutty Autumn.
1840000	1844000	Two mildly sane...
1844000	1845000	Whatever.
1845000	1846000	No, One Crazy Summer.
1846000	1848000	How about Dan Harmon kills himself?
1848000	1851000	One Crazy Summer had a different title.
1851000	1854000	And then Savage Steve Holland was so upset when they called it One Crazy Summer.
1854000	1861000	And he's like, if Warner Brothers was releasing Woody Allen movie, it'd be One Neurotic Jew.
1861000	1863000	So, we had a...
1863000	1864000	Jenny Moore was in that.
1864000	1865000	Was Curtis Armstrong in that?
1865000	1866000	Curtis, a.k.a.
1866000	1867000	Booger.
1867000	1872000	Yeah, we'd be walking around with Cusack and Demi Moore and all these people that were
1872000	1876000	recognizable, but no one would recognize anybody except the guy, Booger.
1877000	1879000	Curtis would be like, Booger!
1879000	1880000	Booger!
1880000	1882000	We were in Massachusetts.
1884000	1891000	So, we were talking about One Nutty Autumn, which would have been Hoops McCann,
1891000	1896000	Cusack's character, 30 years later or 25 years later, is now running like a Pixar.
1896000	1900000	Like, his dream did come true because at the end of that, he went off and became an animator.
1900000	1901000	Right.
1901000	1908000	So, in this movie, we all band together to come and try to get his sense of humor back.
1910000	1915000	Before the release of the movie, based on different kinds of hardware in a drawer or whatever.
1915000	1917000	Or no, we try to talk about it doing the Raven.
1920000	1922000	Whatever happened to Savage Steve?
1922000	1924000	Savage Steve Holland directs a lot of stuff.
1924000	1926000	It's like ABC family stuff, yeah.
1927000	1929000	I mean, he was such a...
1929000	1930000	Yeah, he did.
1930000	1933000	Better Off Dead was like, you know, it was...
1933000	1937000	Better Off Dead is a better movie than One Crazy Summer, but they're both really funny
1937000	1939000	and he definitely had his own view.
1939000	1942000	Yeah, you know, he was a very, very unique comedic voice at the time.
1942000	1943000	Right.
1944000	1947000	Better Off Dead was like the easy rider of my...
1947000	1951000	When I was like 10 or something, I don't know how old I was, but it was like,
1951000	1953000	Holy shit, this movie is so fucking different.
1954000	1958000	It didn't break the fourth wall, but it did something equally...
1958000	1961000	It had this mystical realism to it.
1961000	1964000	It was like the paper boy that wants his $2 and he's everywhere.
1964000	1972000	It was somewhere between Zucker Brothers and all the corny ass rat pack movies.
1972000	1975000	They're just getting laughs at the fact that you get a boner.
1975000	1978000	It had this wild...
1978000	1980000	Whatever, why am I explaining Savage Steve?
1981000	1984000	No, but it was the equivalent of that Zucker humor,
1984000	1989000	but it also had characters that were based in reality
1989000	1992000	and by the end of the movie you actually cared about,
1992000	1996000	which is weird when you watch a Zucker movie because they'll be really funny jokes,
1996000	2000000	but eventually I'm like, I don't care about anything and when I get done,
2000000	2003000	I don't have any idea what these filmmakers are thinking about.
2003000	2008000	And clearly, I've noticed that conservative people do very silly comedy
2009000	2013000	because they can't really expose how they really see themselves or the world.
2013000	2016000	Right, so a high fight is something that a Republican could understand.
2016000	2021000	Yeah, or they'll make a Michael Moore movie that tanks.
2022000	2027000	The only reason I'm banging on them is because they're kind of dicks.
2029000	2032000	I haven't met all of them, but one of them is a real cock.
2032000	2034000	I went in and met with them and I go,
2034000	2037000	hey, that meeting went well, and he called up my agent and said,
2037000	2040000	that was the worst meeting I've ever had, why did you send him here?
2040000	2041000	Oh, no.
2041000	2043000	Cool, cool, cool.
2043000	2046000	Good luck with Scary Movie 5.
2049000	2053000	Man, talk about... Fuck that, we can't even talk about that, it's so sad.
2053000	2058000	The way that silly comedy started as silly comedy,
2058000	2061000	which was never hired in the first place, but how fucking low it got.
2061000	2063000	Well, it's not comedy, it's like...
2063000	2065000	These are things you know.
2066000	2069000	It's insanity, recognize this?
2069000	2072000	It's just literally like a guy will walk on screen and he'll just say,
2072000	2076000	I see dead people, and they'll just take a bow and walk off.
2078000	2081000	It was already fucking with us that the Zuckers would go like,
2081000	2083000	hey, he's turned into jelly back there and they'd cut to the guy
2083000	2085000	and he's made of fucking jelly and then they'd cut back
2085000	2087000	and the guy would be normal again.
2087000	2091000	They were still doing gags and they were still stringing it along with a narrative.
2092000	2097000	It's just nuts that people come in and get off my lawn.
2097000	2100000	Everyone, America, get off my lawn.
2100000	2104000	Speaking of getting old, I'm going down my Evernote list,
2104000	2106000	see what else we got here.
2106000	2109000	I wrote down hacky dreaming because last night I had to dream...
2109000	2114000	I feel like now that I'm 40, my serotonin is probably depleting or something
2114000	2119000	or the dots, my unconscious mind is able to connect are getting closer together.
2120000	2123000	Dreams used to be, when I was 25, if I remember a dream,
2123000	2125000	you'd be like, you're on the bank of a river,
2125000	2128000	but the river has upside down buildings instead of clouds
2128000	2132000	and there's a crocodile that goes, hey, let me show you what's in my wallet.
2132000	2134000	It'll be like a picture of Brooke Shields
2134000	2137000	and then she'll start talking and you go into the picture
2137000	2139000	but the picture's at your grandma's house.
2139000	2140000	You'd be like, explain the dream.
2140000	2142000	You're like, wow, I'm fucked up. That's awesome.
2142000	2144000	My brain's on fire.
2144000	2147000	I don't remember a lot about my dream last night,
2147000	2150000	but I remember at one point there was a character who wasn't a crocodile
2150000	2153000	and I was in a normal place and the character of the dream kept going,
2153000	2156000	hey, can I show you something? Can I show you something?
2156000	2161000	He pulled out his wallet and he was clearly stalling for time
2163000	2167000	and never opened his wallet because my brain painted itself into a corner.
2170000	2172000	I remember being conscious of that in my sleep.
2172000	2176000	I was like, shit, man. This used to be a cakewalk.
2181000	2183000	What's in there? A train?
2183000	2185000	If my shame hadn't jarred me awake,
2185000	2188000	there probably would have ended up being just a Python reference in there or something.
2188000	2190000	No, I think you're in a better place.
2190000	2191000	Can I show you something?
2191000	2196000	He has dollars and credit cards and his license.
2196000	2199000	He looks up at you and he goes, you're all out.
2199000	2201000	Dan, you're all out.
2203000	2205000	Your bus room has no budget.
2205000	2207000	You want to go get a sandwich?
2207000	2210000	Shit, this place is cash-only.
2211000	2214000	Was it in color? Do you dream in color?
2214000	2217000	Yes, I guess so.
2217000	2220000	I've heard that conversation happen before,
2220000	2223000	but you would notice if it was black and white, right?
2223000	2225000	You'd be conscious of it being black and white.
2225000	2227000	I think it's more sepia.
2228000	2231000	It's not one way or the other.
2231000	2233000	I just remember the experiences,
2233000	2235000	and since my experiences are in color,
2235000	2238000	and since the things that I dream are kind of the same as the things that happen,
2238000	2242000	except with crocodiles and stuff, I assume it's in color.
2242000	2245000	But I've had bold dreams that felt like reality,
2245000	2250000	and they popped more. They were more HD than...
2250000	2254000	Wouldn't it be great when you have a really shitty, vivid dream?
2254000	2257000	It's one of those dreams that's so grounded,
2258000	2260000	but it's skewing bad.
2260000	2262000	It's not like I found $50 and then you wake up
2262000	2265000	and you get that $50 smile that's fully phased.
2265000	2267000	I don't have $50.
2268000	2269000	But the opposite...
2269000	2271000	Isn't it great when the opposite happens?
2271000	2273000	It's just kind of like,
2273000	2276000	shit, I lost a YouTube video contest or something.
2276000	2278000	Everyone saw my dick or something,
2278000	2281000	and then you wake up and you're kind of bummed out about it.
2281000	2283000	And you forgive yourself.
2283000	2285000	You're like, oh, well, everyone makes mistakes.
2285000	2287000	So now everyone knows what my dick looks like now,
2287000	2289000	and I'm just going to take it a day to take...
2289000	2292000	Wait a minute, no, I didn't do that. That's crazy.
2292000	2295000	Or, like, an unimaginative dream that's not easy.
2295000	2298000	I mean, that's super easy to figure out.
2298000	2301000	Like, you know, you're just standing with someone
2301000	2304000	and you're crushing on watching a train.
2305000	2308000	You go, hmm, I guess I want a fucker.
2309000	2311000	Boring.
2312000	2314000	What did that dream mean about... I don't know.
2314000	2316000	We were eating popsicles.
2316000	2318000	Me and Richard Geer.
2319000	2321000	We were in a big wheel, and it just kind of...
2321000	2323000	Sober for a week, hanky dreaming.
2323000	2325000	Willow Creek, your movie, I want to...
2325000	2327000	You should get something out of this.
2327000	2329000	You had a screening of this movie, Willow Creek.
2329000	2331000	It's like this Bigfoot kind of horror movie that you made,
2331000	2334000	where the interesting experiment is that you...
2334000	2337000	There's narrative elements that you shot like a regular movie,
2337000	2341000	but because it's a Bigfoot, like, kind of a mythology movie,
2341000	2342000	it's sort of the Bigfoot myth,
2342000	2345000	you have interviews as if they're part of the narrative,
2345000	2347000	as if, you know, it would be one of the...
2347000	2348000	Yeah, well, they are.
2348000	2350000	But your interviews are actually real interviews
2350000	2353000	with real Bigfoot people who didn't know they were characters
2353000	2354000	in your movie.
2354000	2357000	Well, I didn't do that out of being, like, mean.
2357000	2359000	No, it wasn't like a candid camera.
2359000	2361000	No, I just thought if I explained it to them,
2361000	2364000	it would have made them, you know,
2364000	2366000	it suddenly would have been very hammy
2366000	2368000	or it would have been overthinking.
2368000	2370000	So they didn't need to know that the actors
2370000	2373000	that they were talking to really weren't Jim and Kelly
2373000	2374000	from San Francisco.
2374000	2375000	Right.
2375000	2376000	Yeah.
2376000	2377000	But I did...
2377000	2380000	I was heavily into the Sasquatch community.
2380000	2382000	I was fortunate to have...
2382000	2384000	How did I tell you?
2384000	2385000	In order to get to...
2385000	2387000	It's where the Patterson-Gimlin footage was shot.
2387000	2389000	So that's the famous Bigfoot...
2389000	2391000	You're in a little deep...
2391000	2392000	Oh, you were about to explain it, sorry.
2392000	2393000	Yes.
2393000	2394000	I was about to tease you for...
2394000	2395000	Oh, for the Patterson-Gimlin.
2395000	2396000	You're a little deep.
2396000	2397000	You were inside too long.
2397000	2398000	It's too deep.
2398000	2399000	Cover it up.
2399000	2400000	No one went...
2400000	2402000	So I thought I better explain.
2402000	2403000	Patterson-Gimlin is the...
2403000	2405000	You've seen that footage of Bigfoot turning around
2405000	2406000	and looking behind...
2406000	2407000	Yeah, okay.
2407000	2409000	Behind herself, by the way.
2409000	2411000	It has breasts on that one.
2411000	2414000	I do love the Bigfoot guys that found that.
2414000	2416000	Like, they're sewing the Bigfoot and they're going,
2416000	2417000	hey, are those tits?
2417000	2418000	You know what I mean?
2418000	2420000	Like, there you go.
2420000	2423000	Meanwhile, there's six messages from their girlfriends.
2423000	2424000	Like, what are you guys doing?
2424000	2425000	You're watching this footage.
2425000	2426000	Leave it alone.
2426000	2427000	Look at those cans.
2427000	2428000	Oh, you want it, Patty.
2428000	2431000	So that's why they call it that Bigfoot Patty.
2431000	2436000	So I went to where the site was, which is 11 hours from here.
2436000	2439000	And then we go to this town where you drive another 40 miles.
2439000	2441000	And then you go 17 miles down a dirt road.
2441000	2443000	It takes two and a half hours to get there.
2443000	2445000	And the bottom, then we hike.
2445000	2447000	There's no one around, nothing around.
2447000	2449000	And one of the...
2449000	2455000	This Ranger Robert, who is a Sasquatch expert.
2455000	2457000	That's the best way to describe him.
2457000	2459000	It's about 3 AM.
2459000	2461000	We've seen mountain lions.
2461000	2462000	We're in the middle of nowhere.
2462000	2464000	This guy is my life.
2464000	2466000	Like, if anything ever happened to us,
2466000	2468000	this is how I'm going to live.
2468000	2473000	And he says, so, you know, I'm a writer, too.
2473000	2474000	And I go, oh, really?
2474000	2475000	What do you write?
2475000	2480000	He goes, well, I write, it's, you know, Twilight?
2480000	2481000	And I go, yeah, I know Twilight.
2481000	2487000	So I write, like Twilight, but said in the Bigfoot community,
2487000	2494000	I write books for tweens in the Sasquatch world.
2494000	2496000	And I go, oh, that's good.
2496000	2499000	And he goes, I know this sounds like I'm setting you up,
2499000	2501000	but this is not true.
2501000	2508000	And then he goes, I have my book Yeti or Not.
2508000	2512000	It's a coming-of-age town.
2512000	2514000	And I think some of you are calling bullshit on this.
2514000	2515000	Just look it up.
2515000	2516000	You can buy it.
2516000	2517000	Oh, it exists.
2517000	2518000	It's published.
2518000	2519000	Oh, sure, sure.
2519000	2520000	Oh, Jesus.
2520000	2523000	You know, so Yeti or Not.
2523000	2527000	And, yeah, so, you know, you said something
2527000	2529000	really funny about-
2529000	2530000	I doubt it.
2530000	2533000	No, it is, because I've stole it.
2533000	2536000	Now, when I'm doing the Q&A, I explain it,
2537000	2540000	where you said, we were talking about picked-upon subgroups.
2540000	2541000	Right.
2541000	2546000	And you said it's like people who love Renfaire and then
2546000	2551000	Al-Qaeda and then Bigfoot believers,
2551000	2554000	as far as people who get picked up,
2554000	2556000	or people that people don't understand.
2556000	2560000	Some people are rolling with a couple of Al-Qaeda people.
2560000	2561000	Yeah.
2561000	2562000	Let's see what he's got to say.
2562000	2564000	Maybe he's got some valid points.
2565000	2567000	He joined for the health benefits.
2567000	2568000	It's not-
2570000	2573000	The thing is, he's a great drinking buddy.
2573000	2574000	All right.
2574000	2575000	All right.
2575000	2576000	All right.
2576000	2577000	Sober for a week.
2577000	2578000	Hacking Dream and Willow Creek.
2578000	2579000	Documentary Baby Hands.
2579000	2580000	Purge.
2580000	2581000	Return of the Archons.
2581000	2582000	That Purge movie.
2582000	2584000	Looks like it's ripping off the Star Trek original series
2584000	2585000	episode, Return of the Archons.
2585000	2587000	Look it up and cry it from the rooftops.
2587000	2588000	Maybe they give him credit.
2588000	2589000	I don't know.
2589000	2590000	It's like, obviously, this Purge thing.
2590000	2591000	And I asked somebody what it's about.
2591000	2593000	And their description is the description of this Star Trek
2593000	2594000	original episode.
2594000	2596000	But I don't know about the original episode.
2596000	2599000	Is it just that you have an X amount of time to go kill?
2599000	2600000	Yeah.
2600000	2601000	That's where Stiller's production company, Red Hour,
2601000	2602000	gets its name from.
2602000	2605000	It's a reference to their festival.
2605000	2606000	I think I'm getting this right.
2606000	2608000	You definitely don't want to get things wrong.
2608000	2610000	Where you get to kill for one hour?
2610000	2611000	Yeah.
2611000	2613000	I think they Purge for an hour.
2613000	2615000	Like, nothing is illegal.
2615000	2616000	You can do anything to anyone you want.
2616000	2620000	But is it the idea that we're all just kind of suppressing this?
2620000	2621000	Yeah.
2621000	2624000	Because they do this, they're able to be collective and
2624000	2625000	harmonic for the rest of them.
2625000	2627000	So like what the...
2627000	2629000	Oh, shoot.
2629000	2631000	You know, the pretzels.
2631000	2633000	The Amish do.
2633000	2634000	Oh.
2634000	2635000	Oh, that...
2635000	2637000	Yeah, a little bit like that.
2637000	2638000	Ragnarok.
2641000	2642000	Rumspring.
2642000	2643000	Rumspring.
2643000	2644000	Rumspring.
2644000	2646000	Anyone here on Rumspringing tonight?
2647000	2649000	Whoo!
2649000	2652000	It's worse than a bachelorette party, I'm telling you.
2652000	2655000	It's just one guy with a bunch of dick-shaped cups.
2655000	2657000	That is the bane of stand-up.
2657000	2659000	That is the bachelorette party.
2659000	2660000	Oh, man.
2660000	2661000	It is the worst.
2661000	2662000	Right down front.
2662000	2664000	It won't make you a feminist.
2664000	2665000	It will not.
2665000	2667000	Like, as a stand-up, you will not.
2667000	2670000	Your Alan Alda stuff will not come out on stage
2670000	2672000	if there's a bachelorette party about it.
2672000	2674000	But a bachelorette party is not being thrown by feminists.
2674000	2675000	You know, it's not.
2675000	2676000	That's what I'm saying.
2676000	2680000	It does not bring the woman lover out of you.
2680000	2684000	And it's always like dick cups and dick pads.
2684000	2687000	There's all this shit on the table and they're wearing shit on their heads
2687000	2693000	and they're screaming at a frequency that only chimpanzees like know
2693000	2696000	and associate with tigers.
2696000	2698000	Talk about Chloe! Talk about Chloe!
2698000	2699000	Yeah.
2699000	2702000	And then finally you say something like,
2702000	2703000	please be quiet.
2703000	2706000	Like, America hates you right now.
2706000	2710000	And so fucking vindictively angry.
2710000	2713000	Like, during the show, after the show, I remember,
2713000	2716000	because I would referee for this thing called comedy sports
2716000	2717000	where you stand up there.
2717000	2720000	That's like hosting an improv show.
2720000	2722000	You're getting the suggestions, all this stuff.
2722000	2726000	Like, the fucking worst bachelorette parties will kill me.
2726000	2728000	You know, once I just went like,
2728000	2730000	I'm not proud that I can shut up hecklers.
2731000	2734000	And the crowd hated these women so much.
2734000	2738000	And I finally just, I kind of, they were like, kick them out, shut them up.
2738000	2740000	And so I just unleash on them.
2740000	2745000	And I truly, I really don't, when I see red, I really, it's just like, blah, right?
2745000	2748000	And I come out of it because the crowd's cheering.
2748000	2749000	Because...
2749000	2750000	You're like Teen Wolf.
2750000	2751000	Because people...
2751000	2752000	He's holding a basketball.
2752000	2753000	Yeah.
2755000	2759000	Why if I have poodle parts and blood on core all over me?
2759000	2762000	It's like a scene from that hot new franchise, Yeti or Not.
2762000	2763000	Yeti or Not.
2764000	2767000	Where Blake comes to and the Himalayas,
2767000	2770000	and it's like, did I do it all the way with Veronica?
2770000	2772000	Don't make Seth angry.
2774000	2775000	And that's the thing.
2775000	2777000	It's like the crowd, we're weird.
2777000	2778000	I guess that's just all culture.
2778000	2779000	But people go nuts.
2779000	2780000	They really love that.
2780000	2784000	Yeah, because people love other people giving bait up.
2784000	2786000	A bar's never empty because I go,
2786000	2788000	hey, quick, two guys are getting along in the parking lot.
2789000	2791000	Let's watch them get along.
2791000	2794000	I think there's loose change falling back into their pockets
2794000	2797000	because they love each other so much.
2797000	2803000	I totally, I know I just abuse these women to shame them.
2803000	2805000	And then I come out of it and the crowd's cheering.
2805000	2807000	And then I go back into my monologue,
2807000	2810000	and then this woman stands up, tears.
2810000	2813000	And she goes, I am not a whore.
2819000	2822000	I don't remember.
2822000	2826000	Also, the male equivalent, the bachelor party,
2826000	2828000	even if they're at a strip club,
2828000	2831000	they're still not, they don't have hats with vaginas on it.
2831000	2833000	That would just be creepy.
2833000	2837000	And there's a table full of dudes with vaginas on their heads.
2838000	2840000	You better call the cops.
2840000	2843000	They clearly have bodies in a trunk.
2843000	2844000	You get it?
2844000	2845000	I'm getting married.
2845000	2847000	Here's a vagina straw.
2848000	2849000	A vagina ladle.
2849000	2851000	I don't know what you'd make out of a vagina.
2851000	2855000	Just think, are you from the state that prides itself on its calamari?
2855000	2857000	They wouldn't know what it was.
2857000	2860000	How do you make a vagina in a hat form?
2862000	2865000	I don't want to keep coming up with analogies.
2865000	2867000	No one's going to make any friends.
2867000	2869000	Yeah, I think they've already been done.
2872000	2874000	Jeremy Piven.
2874000	2875000	All right.
2875000	2877000	Kanye up front, who cares?
2877000	2879000	Kanye came out at the Adult Swim up front
2879000	2881000	and he was surrounded by so much fog.
2881000	2883000	I have a feeling I didn't actually see Kanye perform.
2883000	2885000	I think he was like some body double.
2887000	2889000	Downton Abbey.
2889000	2891000	Well, how about that Downton Abbey?
2893000	2894000	Dog shopping.
2894000	2895000	We went to the dog store.
2895000	2897000	We got our dog coming in six days,
2897000	2900000	so Aaron and I went to the dot petco today.
2900000	2903000	They have these horrible fucking panhandler people
2903000	2906000	that work for all the different dog food companies
2906000	2908000	just roaming the store.
2910000	2911000	Shaking you down?
2911000	2912000	Yeah.
2912000	2914000	I mean, whatever.
2914000	2916000	I'm going to shame you here.
2916000	2918000	You went and bought a puppy mill dog?
2918000	2919000	Yeah.
2919000	2922000	Well, I mean, it's a lady outside San Diego.
2922000	2924000	She's, you know, whatever.
2924000	2926000	The more I protest, the more guilty her I'll sound.
2926000	2928000	She's not a puppy mill.
2928000	2931000	But in defense of, actually, I think it is petco.
2931000	2933000	You know, they do have adoption days and things there.
2933000	2934000	They're not so bad.
2934000	2935000	Yeah, yeah.
2935000	2939000	And I was able to, out of guilt, like give 20 bucks to rescuing dogs
2939000	2946000	just through the purchasing of all my shit for my gross bread super dog
2946000	2948000	that I brought into the world
2948000	2951000	instead of taking a nice Chinese dog whose parents got shot.
2951000	2952000	But you know, here's the thing.
2952000	2953000	All my cats.
2954000	2955000	And he had to watch.
2956000	2959000	All of my cats are rescues.
2959000	2963000	But one, you know, Peeps LaRue actually is from Petsco.
2963000	2964000	And she's...
2964000	2965000	I know Peeps.
2965000	2967000	Peeps is in the spectrum.
2967000	2971000	She doesn't like to get pet, but you can squeeze her when she comes.
2971000	2972000	It's really tough.
2972000	2974000	They have those vests for anxiety, but she'd love those.
2974000	2976000	Maybe I should put Peeps in one.
2976000	2977000	But now she's pretty gordo.
2977000	2978000	She's pretty fat.
2978000	2979000	Well, they're Velcro.
2979000	2981000	I mean, they're like, you know what I mean?
2981000	2982000	Okay, so they grow whither?
2982000	2983000	I got you.
2984000	2985000	Like, if I was on a plane with Peeps,
2985000	2988000	I'd have to ask for the extra seatbelt.
2988000	2990000	Kevin Smith section?
2990000	2992000	Yeah, I imagine Peeps would make you pay for another.
2992000	2994000	But Squeaky Fromm is my other cat.
2994000	2997000	Detective Carla Whiskerson and...
2997000	2998000	Who am I forgetting?
2998000	3000000	Oh, the Widow, Madeleine, Perman.
3002000	3006000	No, I know Aaron's reminding what the Downton Abbey thing is.
3006000	3007000	Okay, fine.
3007000	3011000	I was drunk in New York and...
3012000	3013000	A Shaw.
3013000	3017000	Aaron's trying to watch Downton Abbey on a laptop next to me in bed.
3017000	3021000	I woke up because she ordered bagel from...
3021000	3023000	Let's not get distracted by my pronunciation.
3026000	3029000	She ordered bagels from room service,
3029000	3032000	and I could smell the sesame, and I woke up.
3032000	3034000	And then I was like, I guess I was annoying her,
3034000	3038000	and she was trying to watch Downton Abbey, so I kept going like,
3038000	3040000	Oh, good day, governor.
3040000	3041000	Like, under my breath.
3041000	3044000	And she was trying to listen with earbuds, so she would be like...
3044000	3046000	Because I don't usually, I'm not like one of those jokers
3046000	3048000	where I'm like doing shit and then saying like,
3048000	3049000	What, what?
3049000	3051000	But I was so drunk, I just started...
3051000	3052000	It was weird.
3052000	3054000	For the first time in our year and a half, two year relationship,
3054000	3057000	whatever it is, who knows what color eyes are.
3059000	3062000	For the first time ever, I was just being like a fratty douche.
3062000	3065000	Like, I just kept on, I was like...
3065000	3066000	I was just like a lack of guys going,
3066000	3069000	Aaron, I swear to God, I'm not doing that.
3069000	3071000	Like, it's just British people talking.
3071000	3072000	What do you...
3072000	3073000	How can you...
3073000	3074000	What do you think I'm doing?
3074000	3075000	You think...
3075000	3076000	And then she'd put her earbuds back and she'd say,
3076000	3077000	She's being fucking weird.
3077000	3080000	And then I'd go like, Oh, go to the gym.
3080000	3083000	She'd be like, What the fuck are you doing?
3083000	3085000	And I did it for like 20 minutes.
3085000	3089000	And I was like, Aaron, I swear to God, I am not...
3089000	3090000	Look at me.
3090000	3091000	I love you.
3091000	3093000	I'm not doing that.
3094000	3096000	And she's like, I don't understand this bit.
3096000	3098000	I'm like, that's because it's not a bit.
3098000	3100000	And she's like, okay, then you're having a stroke.
3100000	3103000	And I was like, if you think that there's something wrong
3103000	3107000	with me because you think that I'm speaking British talk
3107000	3111000	without moving my lips at all, which would be a huge feat,
3111000	3114000	and you should give me a medal.
3114000	3117000	Have you ever gone down so far that you just don't want
3117000	3119000	to bust that it's a joke because...
3119000	3121000	Well, because she was like so disappointed in me
3121000	3124000	because she's funnier than me a little bit.
3124000	3126000	I was like, well, fuck her, then it'll be the longest joke
3126000	3129000	if not the funniest.
3129000	3131000	Then you have brain damage.
3131000	3135000	And I'm like, if it's the choice between that and that, fine.
3135000	3137000	And she's like, okay, then I'm calling 911.
3137000	3140000	And I'm like, if you really want to call 911,
3140000	3142000	she dialed the nine and the one.
3142000	3144000	I was like, all right, what the fuck?
3144000	3145000	She was gonna...
3145000	3149000	My joke was so bad, she called the hospital a lot.
3149000	3151000	She was gonna have me arrested.
3151000	3153000	She wouldn't, before she would believe it,
3153000	3157000	she was just gonna have me thrown in jail or a hospital.
3157000	3162000	I was moving, so I canceled the service on my TV,
3162000	3166000	but I said, I'm moving in two weeks, will you cut it off?
3166000	3169000	And I had to explain that I didn't want that service anymore
3169000	3171000	and they get really...
3171000	3174000	They won't let you drop their service.
3174000	3176000	And I said, well, I'm doing an experiment.
3176000	3178000	I'm not watching television for a year,
3178000	3179000	so I said, okay, well.
3179000	3181000	So then we both sit down to watch a program
3181000	3183000	that we were all excited about and the TV goes...
3183000	3185000	They had turned it off two weeks premature.
3185000	3187000	I don't know if it was aggressive or what.
3187000	3190000	Call him up, explain it to him.
3190000	3192000	They say...
3192000	3196000	And my wife's explaining to me, look, he's not moving.
3196000	3199000	He's moving in two weeks.
3199000	3201000	Can you turn it off then?
3201000	3206000	The guy goes, I need to talk to the homeowner.
3206000	3209000	I'm the apartment guy, my title.
3209000	3210000	So she...
3210000	3211000	The Lord.
3211000	3213000	The Lord.
3213000	3216000	So she hands me the phone and I go,
3216000	3220000	I don't know this woman.
3220000	3223000	Don't turn off my TV.
3223000	3226000	She does things like this to me all the time.
3226000	3230000	If you know my wife, the anger at that moment...
3230000	3234000	I forgot the part that she was on hold for like 35 minutes.
3234000	3236000	I kept getting switched to different departments
3236000	3238000	and she was all ready to kill.
3238000	3241000	And then I go, I don't know who she is.
3241000	3243000	She does this all the time.
3243000	3245000	So you're saying don't turn my TV back on?
3245000	3247000	Yeah, just kidding.
3247000	3249000	It's just a different freeware of your life.
3249000	3250000	This will be better than TV.
3250000	3252000	I just looked at her and I said,
3252000	3255000	before you say anything, I need to remember this face
3255000	3262000	because this is the face I'm going to see before I die.
3263000	3266000	But yeah, sometimes you go down the hole and...
3266000	3268000	How seriously do you think your wife's life...
3268000	3270000	The accent is Mary Poppins.
3270000	3271000	Hello, Governor.
3271000	3273000	You need your chimney sweeped?
3273000	3276000	Hello, Mary Poppins.
3276000	3278000	Do you think your wife might kill you ever?
3278000	3281000	Well, I am going to really flip people out
3281000	3283000	because I am a gun owner.
3283000	3287000	And people go, well, you know that you're not going to stop a burglary
3287000	3291000	and I don't have any delusions that I'm going to.
3291000	3296000	But the likelihood of someone in your family killing you is very great,
3296000	3298000	which is a true statistic.
3298000	3300000	And I go, look, one way or another,
3300000	3303000	I know that's the last face I'm going to see.
3303000	3307000	Better it be an instrument designed to take me out fast.
3307000	3309000	You're like, I'm knitting needle.
3309000	3311000	Well, that's sexist.
3311000	3313000	My knitting needle.
3313000	3317000	Hey, hey, men knit.
3317000	3318000	Yeah, I might...
3318000	3319000	Alex Karish used to knit.
3319000	3323000	I'm constantly telling Erin that she's going to kill me.
3323000	3327000	I love her so much, but I've never had more.
3327000	3333000	I'm so mean in fights and we're so equally stubborn.
3333000	3336000	We just get these fights that no one else would get into
3336000	3341000	because all it is is she'll imply that I did something wrong
3341000	3344000	or imply that I hurt her feelings in some way.
3344000	3347000	And instead of just going, sorry about that, whatever,
3348000	3350000	which wouldn't even be arguably that altruistic.
3350000	3353000	It would just be a person lazy enough to just not want to fucking...
3353000	3355000	I always go like, no, I didn't.
3355000	3356000	What are you talking about?
3356000	3357000	Shut up.
3357000	3359000	You did something worse on Wednesday.
3359000	3364000	And instead of her going like, I go out with a dipshit.
3364000	3366000	He's a fucking baby.
3366000	3369000	I'll never get this 48 minutes of my life back if I go down this road.
3369000	3372000	She goes like, Wednesday was a different thing.
3372000	3374000	And we just fucking start...
3375000	3378000	We're awful, but I can't live without her.
3378000	3380000	So I know I'm going to...
3380000	3383000	You're not supposed to say I'm going to marry somebody and tell you whatever.
3383000	3388000	But I'm saying I know that she's the one for me,
3388000	3392000	but I think that means I'm going to die by murder.
3392000	3397000	That was the sweetest story about homicide.
3397000	3401000	I'm actually touched and you're trying to explain that.
3401000	3405000	I'm saying that if I thought it was possible to dump Aaron,
3405000	3411000	maybe the prostate cancer would be a higher candidate for my death.
3411000	3415000	Yeah, we're just an episode of snapped waiting to happen.
3415000	3416000	I don't know.
3416000	3419000	Your audience isn't a big oxygen audience.
3419000	3425000	But snapped is a show where it's only about a woman that kills a spouse.
3425000	3427000	And it's kind of like Blaxploitation movies.
3427000	3430000	It's like, wait, who made this? And who is it for?
3430000	3432000	And who am I rooting for?
3432000	3436000	I love that show because it's clean storytelling.
3436000	3440000	They meet, something goes wrong, bitch gets a knife.
3440000	3443000	That's really what they should call that show.
3443000	3446000	Bitch gets a knife because it always starts off.
3446000	3449000	They met in high school. They were the perfect couple.
3449000	3451000	Like, oh, this is going to be good.
3451000	3456000	Then they go, when we return to snapped, Kira snaps.
3456000	3458000	And then they go to dog food commercial.
3458000	3461000	Maybe I should just edit that together.
3461000	3462000	That part.
3462000	3464000	Steven Soddenberg was making a speech recently,
3464000	3467000	and he talked about how he was really disheartened.
3467000	3469000	He was on a flight, and he looked over.
3469000	3474000	And he saw a guy who had edited all the action scenes out of big,
3474000	3477000	big movies together.
3477000	3479000	And he was just watching that.
3479000	3482000	It was just CGI porn.
3482000	3484000	He was just watching action porn.
3484000	3487000	He cut the story out and just got right to the car chase,
3487000	3489000	as people say, cut to the car chase.
3489000	3491000	He did.
3491000	3493000	And did you see this speech?
3493000	3495000	No, I keep hearing about it.
3495000	3498000	He's this guy that I always really look up to,
3498000	3504000	and he basically made the speech where he's quitting.
3504000	3507000	It's just saying it's not worth it.
3507000	3509000	It's a losing battle.
3509000	3511000	I got a teacup.
3511000	3512000	It's a big boat.
3512000	3514000	There's a lot of holes.
3514000	3516000	This is my hero.
3516000	3520000	He very eloquently explains why it's not worth it
3520000	3523000	to make movies and tell stories.
3523000	3525000	I keep hearing about the speech.
3525000	3527000	I never really connected the dots of his name, what he's done.
3527000	3529000	I'm sure I turned out to do a few.
3529000	3530000	So many movies.
3530000	3533000	He's always just been the guy whose last name makes me thirsty.
3533000	3535000	But there's so many movies.
3535000	3537000	He does so many art pictures,
3537000	3539000	and then he does big box office.
3539000	3541000	And I thought, well, here's a guy who found the balance.
3541000	3543000	He does the Oceans 11, but at the same time,
3543000	3545000	he does the Che movie.
3545000	3547000	He's a fascinating guy.
3547000	3550000	He started doing sex lives and videotapes.
3550000	3552000	He's made a million movies, some that are huge.
3552000	3557000	But he can't justify the carbon print making movies.
3557000	3560000	And I'm like, you should go make a movie with me,
3560000	3563000	because there is no carbon footprint.
3563000	3565000	It's total Edward.
3566000	3568000	It's your world's first green director.
3568000	3571000	Yeah, I am very green.
3571000	3573000	As a director, you will leave only footprints.
3573000	3577000	As long as the four guys that it took to film this movie
3577000	3579000	recycle, we're ahead.
3583000	3584000	Oh, Soderberg.
3584000	3588000	Erin is now, she comp trolls through text messages.
3588000	3591000	She directed the Liberace movie.
3591000	3592000	Did you see that?
3592000	3593000	Yeah.
3593000	3596000	That was why he kind of, I think he's just kind of...
3596000	3600000	After you made Michael Douglas make out with Matt Damon,
3600000	3602000	you're kind of like, all says, what else?
3602000	3603000	What's left?
3603000	3605000	I'm the Neil Armstrong of the directors.
3605000	3609000	No, but he, I think he was frustrated that he couldn't get that movie,
3609000	3613000	you know, I guess he saw it as, I could be a way off base.
3613000	3615000	He couldn't get it made in 3D. That was just big.
3615000	3616000	Exactly.
3616000	3617000	Coming at you.
3617000	3619000	He wanted the IMAX money and he couldn't.
3620000	3623000	You know, I saw the writing on the wall with Liberace.
3623000	3626000	I didn't see that he was going to be around too much longer.
3626000	3628000	You suspected me?
3628000	3629000	I did.
3629000	3632000	So we were making a police academy and I was in Canada.
3632000	3635000	And I suggested to the producer that I said,
3635000	3639000	hey, you know these bad guys we're catching at the end of the movie?
3639000	3642000	What if we established them at the very early scenes?
3642000	3644000	Because there's a scene right now at the beginning
3644000	3645000	with these guys breaking the law.
3645000	3647000	What if they were the same guys?
3647000	3650000	You know, I was suggesting a story.
3650000	3652000	And I got berated.
3652000	3655000	Like, I've been in the business for 35 years, blah, blah, blah.
3655000	3657000	You know, I got chewed out hard.
3657000	3660000	So I went to the airport, flew to New York City,
3660000	3665000	and bought Liberace tickets in the middle of the production.
3665000	3668000	So they're trying to give me my call for the next morning
3668000	3669000	and they're freaking out.
3669000	3671000	And they finally get Tim Kasaritsky.
3671000	3672000	And they go, where is he?
3672000	3674000	And they go, oh, he went to New York.
3674000	3676000	Nobody gave a permission to go to New York.
3676000	3678000	What is he doing?
3678000	3681000	He said he was going to see Liberace.
3681000	3682000	And I did.
3682000	3683000	And I went and I saw him.
3683000	3684000	It was an amazing show.
3684000	3687000	And I bought tons of Liberace.
3687000	3690000	Like, he had everything you'd want, like soap on the rope.
3690000	3692000	Seriously, not even winking.
3692000	3695000	Like, Liberace soap on the rope.
3695000	3697000	And I just came back.
3697000	3699000	I was 40 minutes late to call and I just handed out
3699000	3703000	all these Liberace gifts to the crew that had been waiting around.
3703000	3704000	All right.
3705000	3709000	That concludes the discussion portion of the meeting.
3709000	3711000	We have to move on to your favorite part, the Dungeons
3711000	3712000	and Dragons portion.
3712000	3715000	Let's bring up Spencer printing in our dungeon master.
3715000	3717000	Wow, that wasn't fast.
3717000	3718000	Yeah, it does.
3718000	3719000	Look what time it is.
3719000	3720000	Uh-oh.
3720000	3721000	Jeff Davis would love that.
3721000	3722000	Uh-oh.
3722000	3724000	Jeff Davis is one of those guys that insists
3724000	3728000	that it's uncanny how many times he sees 9-11 on a clock.
3728000	3733000	I am a dine-in-the-wool skeptic about this idea.
3733000	3734000	You just notice.
3734000	3735000	You don't notice 9-13.
3735000	3736000	You notice 9-11.
3736000	3741000	Jeff thinks that he sees 9-11 on a clock and a watch, an inordinate.
3741000	3744000	Does he feel like he's going to stop it from happening again?
3744000	3746000	Is it like Mothman?
3746000	3747000	Yeah.
3747000	3748000	He just stops there.
3748000	3750000	He just likes to have a little magic in his life.
3750000	3751000	How do you feel about the bombing in Benghazi?
3751000	3753000	Did he see that coming?
3753000	3756000	You think about it all the time.
3756000	3757000	Oh, hello.
3757000	3758000	They have to give it a number.
3758000	3759000	Hello, Spencer.
3759000	3760000	How are you?
3760000	3761000	Great.
3761000	3762000	How are you?
3762000	3767000	You rolled in tonight right on the nugget.
3767000	3770000	We were concerned, not about you.
3770000	3771000	Yeah.
3771000	3773000	I said not and then stammered and then said about you.
3773000	3779000	I think before we go forward, I feel that you guys need to talk about something.
3779000	3784000	I think there's something going on, and let's just get it out and spend some time.
3784000	3785000	Yeah.
3785000	3786000	I mean, okay.
3786000	3791000	You were talking about fat, long-haired beard guys and how that look wasn't for you earlier
3791000	3792000	on in the show.
3792000	3793000	What's that all about?
3793000	3794000	What's wrong with that look?
3794000	3795000	Me?
3795000	3796000	No, no.
3796000	3797000	Do you want that look?
3797000	3798000	Yeah.
3798000	3799000	Dan's trying to get away from it.
3799000	3800000	I'm abandoning it.
3800000	3801000	You're 20...
3801000	3802000	12?
3802000	3803000	What are you?
3803000	3806000	I am 20-12.
3806000	3808000	You're so 2008.
3808000	3811000	I'm so 2000 and late.
3811000	3815000	I mean, you don't have crow's feet.
3815000	3820000	You don't have gray hairs coming out of your nose.
3820000	3823000	You can pull off the mountain man look and be an actual mountain man.
3823000	3830000	I look like a troll in the mountain that your people would sacrifice a virgin to just to
3830000	3832000	keep it raining on time.
3832000	3835000	That was exactly what I was fishing for.
3835000	3838000	Well, good, because I thought I was starting another of my classic fights.
3838000	3840000	Why couldn't I just say I'm sorry?
3840000	3844000	So why do you insist on being right?
3844000	3847000	You want to be happy or you want to be right?
3847000	3848000	There's two lines.
3848000	3853000	Well, but that's a case where me being right made him happier, right?
3853000	3859000	Right, but I mean, sometimes you'll concede and you go, huh, I'm right, but that person
3859000	3862000	is just being an idiot right now and that's human.
3862000	3864000	You think I should have let Spencer be an idiot?
3864000	3865000	Well, I'm not implying he's an idiot.
3865000	3866000	I'm talking about...
3866000	3867000	You guys need to talk?
3867000	3868000	No.
3868000	3871000	Spencer and I are good.
3871000	3875000	I'm not sure I like how you've been undercutting me.
3875000	3876000	Who, me?
3876000	3879000	I'm just stirring up content.
3879000	3883000	Which makes the show interesting, but I've got a little acid going down in my throat
3883000	3884000	right now.
3884000	3890000	Yeah, he's definitely, yeah, physically like he looks like he could pop and like take off
3890000	3891000	your arm.
3891000	3892000	That's what you mean, right?
3892000	3893000	No.
3893000	3894000	No, not at all.
3894000	3897000	Honestly, when I look at him, I never thought I'm threatening, even though he is a lawyer.
3897000	3902000	Bob says he thinks he can kick your ass.
3903000	3908000	All right, let's also bring out our campaign co-players, Kumail Najiani and Aaron McGathey.
3917000	3919000	I'm sorry if we were long-winded.
3919000	3921000	You guys are probably waiting to come out.
3921000	3924000	Have you ever been to this show?
3924000	3925000	This is the show.
3925000	3926000	It was awesome.
3926000	3932000	I always target like nine-ish to start playing D&D, but whatever.
3932000	3938000	But I saw the show a bunch, and I think as soon as I get in Jeff's seat, I'm going to
3938000	3939000	shape this thing up.
3939000	3942000	You know, I'm going to make this commercial.
3942000	3944000	Like your movies.
3944000	3947000	That's not a slam.
3947000	3948000	That's a compliment.
3948000	3949000	Yeah, I am.
3949000	3950000	It really is.
3950000	3951000	Clearly, they're not familiar with my movies.
3951000	3953000	They make hundreds of dollars.
3953000	3955000	Actual hundreds.
3955000	3958000	They're awesome movies, but you know.
3958000	3959000	Well, thank you.
3959000	3960000	Yeah, I don't make them for everybody.
3960000	3965000	I make them for 50-year-old dudes who were in Police Academy.
3965000	3968000	This really is the get off my lawn show.
3968000	3972000	Dan and I may have to have our own show called get off my lawn.
3972000	3976000	We'll just have a giant inflatable cane and we'll just shake it at different things.
3976000	3980000	Talking about, oh, I got a pee four times a night.
3980000	3985000	Aaron was noticing that the hair's coming out of my nostrils on the way over here.
3985000	3986000	Just one.
3986000	3989000	You tried to tuck it in and realized that it was actually coming out.
3989000	3990000	So gross.
3990000	3993000	And then you said something like, oh, I can't take it or something.
3993000	3994000	I was like, oh, man.
3994000	3996000	What if she really can't take it?
3996000	3997000	She's 12 years younger than me.
3997000	3998000	No.
3998000	3999000	She's going to see so much worse before.
3999000	4000000	No, no, no.
4000000	4003000	It wasn't that I can't take that you have hair growing out of your nose.
4003000	4004000	I don't know.
4004000	4005000	I guess maybe it is.
4005000	4008000	That's not what I think about it.
4008000	4009000	No, it's not a cute look.
4009000	4010000	No.
4010000	4011000	I mean, I can...
4011000	4012000	It can be cut.
4012000	4016000	I have friends who are 27, 28 who have nose clippers.
4016000	4017000	Yeah.
4017000	4018000	But I...
4018000	4021000	Shrob got one of those and he, you know, did that thing where you put it up there and you
4021000	4022000	do all that.
4022000	4023000	And he said that that's like...
4023000	4024000	It makes it real sharp.
4024000	4025000	Yeah.
4025000	4026000	And itchy.
4026000	4027000	It's like having five o'clock shadow in your nose.
4027000	4030000	And then also he's convinced that it just...
4030000	4031000	And I don't know if this is a myth.
4031000	4032000	But no.
4032000	4035000	I just believe that the hair, when you shave hair, that it starts coming back.
4035000	4036840	But it's not talking to the follicle.
4036840	4039760	The end of the hair that you're cutting off is not...
4039760	4040760	It's dead.
4040760	4041760	It's not talking to the follicle.
4041760	4042760	It'd be like, hey, we're...
4042760	4043760	I'll talk to it a little bit.
4043760	4044760	I'll talk to it a little bit.
4044760	4046840	How does it talk to it a little bit?
4046840	4052720	There are plants in the Amazon that look exactly like the snake whose venom they cure.
4052720	4053720	What?
4053720	4054720	Wait.
4054720	4056720	Did you just have a stroke?
4056720	4057720	I have.
4057720	4058720	You know what?
4058720	4062600	I can't call bullshit on that.
4062600	4063600	That's just too weird.
4063600	4065120	You just pulled that out of your ass.
4065120	4071080	There are plants in the Amazon that are shaped like they look like the species of snake.
4071080	4076040	The leaf has little things coming off of it and the pattern on the leaf makes it look
4076040	4080440	like the snake that the leaf's juice cures the venom of.
4080440	4082440	It's a prepositional nightmare.
4082440	4087320	Yeah, that's actually what the paper that was written on it said.
4087320	4090560	There's gonna be a lot of fucking prepositions in there.
4090560	4091560	Just assume magic's real.
4091560	4092560	Wait.
4092560	4094400	The human eye is really complicated.
4094400	4096920	So do people not use it to get over a snake bite?
4096920	4097920	They go, ha!
4097920	4098920	That's that snake that bit me.
4098920	4099920	Yeah.
4099920	4100920	And they go, ironically, that would actually cure you.
4100920	4101920	It's a nightmare.
4101920	4102920	I remember I found...
4102920	4111160	And the plant, the people used to use the plant to get over the snake bite, so the
4111160	4114480	plant very recently started going, ah, maybe I'm the snake.
4114480	4115480	Yeah, exactly.
4115480	4118200	That's what scares you so much that you keep uprooting me.
4118200	4122400	You killed my entire family for your selfish means.
4123400	4125400	Oh, I don't want to die for a snake bite.
4125400	4126400	Mutation.
4126400	4128400	Maybe we're just here on this planet.
4128400	4134160	All I'm saying is, I'm not an intelligent design person, but I'm also not a geneticist,
4134160	4139520	and we keep finding out new things about how genes are stimulated and talk to each other
4139520	4141520	and what happens.
4141520	4142920	I think it's possible.
4142920	4147000	I mean, physically, if you just think of one hair, it's dead.
4147000	4148000	But what if the follicle...
4148000	4152040	So you're saying your nose hairs out of spite are growing longer?
4152040	4153040	That's what he said.
4153040	4154040	No, I think there was...
4154040	4155040	They could be...
4155040	4156040	It could be...
4156040	4157040	I'm way out of my league.
4157040	4158040	He's saying it's out of spite.
4158040	4159040	No, it's not out of spite.
4159040	4160040	It's out of protection.
4160040	4161040	They're growing longer.
4161040	4162920	This guy lives in an environment that depletes nose hair.
4162920	4163920	He needs more.
4163920	4169040	That's something that mothers tell their daughters when they're 9, 10 and really want to shave
4169040	4170040	their legs.
4170040	4171040	Do they...
4171040	4172040	Women have this...
4172040	4173040	Yeah, they warn you.
4173040	4175640	Yeah, they're like, well, honey, I would let you start shaving your legs, but it's going
4175640	4179440	to start growing back like a black, gnarled bush if you start...
4179440	4184440	I figured out how it could make sense scientifically, is that if you cut the hair on your nose
4184440	4188520	and then out more dust is going in, then there's some signal like, oh, too much dust, grow
4188520	4189520	more hair.
4189520	4190520	Maybe.
4190520	4194240	I'm going to end this argument right now.
4194240	4197240	With that?
4197240	4199720	I shave my head.
4199720	4201720	There you go.
4201720	4209320	By this theory, I should look like Dan.
4209320	4210320	Speaking of...
4210320	4211320	Everybody got sad over there.
4211320	4213320	Yeah, they don't know.
4213320	4218280	Well, they're 25, so when they're 35, they'll start to laugh at baldness right now.
4218280	4223320	It's like they're like, oh, man, what does he do at night?
4223320	4231320	Like a month ago, I found a gray pubic hair, and I literally wear it on my pubes.
4231320	4233320	But it was your body.
4233320	4234320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4234320	4235320	No, I wasn't...
4235320	4238320	You were at a stop and you looked under the bench.
4238320	4239320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4239320	4244320	I was having sex with a grandmother, and I was like, oh, my God.
4244320	4247320	Everybody likes to pull some steel wool.
4247320	4254320	When I found out my fans are old, it really bummed me out.
4254320	4259320	A bunch of age-appropriate women were flirting with me one night, and I wanted to drink.
4259320	4262960	I was like, oh, my God, I could pull so much steel wool.
4262960	4265920	These saber-toothed tigers are really trying to fuck me.
4265920	4273920	Was it true that Jeremy Piven and Richard Gere only fuck old women with candy bars?
4273920	4274920	I was trying to figure it out.
4274920	4279920	Wait, you know, I actually was at a show, and this woman, my brother had just died,
4279920	4281920	and she says, I heard your brother died.
4281920	4282920	I go, yeah.
4282920	4283920	She says, I have cancer.
4283920	4285920	Do you want me to say hi to him?
4285920	4287920	Oh, God.
4287920	4290920	By the way, she was flirting.
4290920	4294920	And my wife was like, was she really coming onto you with pulling the cancer card?
4294920	4295920	She was super hot.
4295920	4298920	She was really thin.
4298920	4300920	Was she hot?
4300920	4301920	No, no.
4301920	4306920	She definitely, though, if you looked at her, she definitely had a cancer vibe.
4306920	4312920	I would give anything to follow that woman for a day and see all of the inappropriate jokes that she makes.
4312920	4314920	Can I cut in front of you in line?
4314920	4317920	My kids are about to bury me.
4317920	4319920	Yeah, at Starbucks, she's like, my name's cancer.
4319920	4321920	I mean, Amy.
4321920	4326920	But put cancer on the cup, because, yeah, I'm more cancer than person at this point.
4326920	4328920	Just write cancer on the cup.
4328920	4332920	Just now, I started feeling bad that I told that story, but then I realized it happened two years ago,
4332920	4333920	so there's no way she...
4333920	4335920	Aww.
4335920	4337920	What?
4337920	4339920	Wait, if she's alive...
4339920	4342920	She's gonna punch her brother in heaven now.
4342920	4344920	No, my brother...
4344920	4348920	My brother is this crazy biker guy who I don't think she would punch, you know.
4348920	4350920	He used to hunt from his house.
4350920	4351920	It's gonna get too...
4351920	4353920	It'll take too long to explain this.
4353920	4354920	We should just...
4354920	4356920	We'll put an asterisk there and come back.
4356920	4360920	Are you talking about the ironically but reciprocally nicknamed kitten, Goldthwaite?
4360920	4363920	No, my older brother...
4363920	4364920	I spoke at his funeral.
4364920	4365920	He used to...
4365920	4366920	He was a poacher.
4366920	4371920	Like, when he died, he lived in Central New York, so he's a game poacher.
4371920	4374920	I think that was only a cartoon villain occupation.
4374920	4375920	No, no, no.
4375920	4376920	No, the warden...
4376920	4379920	The warden, his kids would tell me the game warden used to come in the house
4379920	4381920	and bust open the lock on his freezer.
4381920	4384920	Wow, he was like a joker.
4384920	4386920	He had, like, the actual game warden.
4386920	4387920	He would have to run out the back door.
4387920	4389920	The stories with him just go on and on.
4389920	4390920	We're not gonna start.
4390920	4392920	Do you know if your brother ever watched Captain Planet?
4392920	4394920	No, no.
4394920	4396920	He was the biker guy.
4396920	4397920	Right, right.
4397920	4400920	My brother, biker hunter, because he...
4400920	4402920	Okay, I'll quickly tell a fast story.
4403920	4407920	He had this house, and he was living with his family at the time, these kids,
4407920	4409920	and I was worried that he didn't...
4409920	4414920	This house needed new windows and installation, so I gave him some money for it,
4414920	4416920	and then I drove out to make sure he spent it on it.
4416920	4419920	And he did, lo and behold, have new windows in the house.
4419920	4421920	He lived with those in the middle of nowhere.
4421920	4425920	And I went up, and in the bathroom, I saw that one of the windows were broke,
4425920	4430920	and first there's corn in the front yard and then the back yard and just no rows.
4430920	4431920	It's just growing up.
4431920	4433920	It's like psycho corn.
4433920	4436920	And my friend Tony goes...
4436920	4437920	He's with me.
4437920	4438920	He goes, what's the deal with all the corn?
4438920	4440920	He goes, oh, you know, it's for the deer.
4440920	4443920	And Tony goes, oh, you help him through the winter?
4443920	4446920	And he goes, no, I'm gonna blast him.
4446920	4449920	So, they're like blood on the corn.
4449920	4452920	No, that's a good title for his autobiography.
4452920	4454920	His bio.
4454920	4458920	So I go to the bathroom, and the windows broke, and I go, what happened to this window?
4458920	4459920	It's brand new.
4459920	4462920	And he goes, yeah, I had a problem with recoil.
4462920	4467920	So, my brother was shooting deer on the toilet.
4467920	4469920	And that's not a makeup story.
4469920	4471920	Just like one-handed?
4471920	4472920	Whoo-hoo!
4472920	4475920	I used like my phone on the toilet.
4475920	4476920	No, he would shoot...
4476920	4477920	That's extra crazy when you...
4477920	4478920	A rifle.
4478920	4480920	That rare euphemism for taking a shit.
4480920	4482920	Shooting deer.
4482920	4484920	No, is that really one?
4484920	4485920	I'm pretty sure...
4485920	4488920	He's like, why'd I go...
4488920	4489920	I'm gonna shoot some deer.
4489920	4490920	I'm gonna shoot some deer.
4490920	4491920	I'm gonna shoot some deer.
4491920	4492920	I'm gonna shoot some deer.
4492920	4493920	I thought I was gonna shoot...
4493920	4495920	I just had a fawn.
4495920	4498920	I really thought I was gonna shoot more deer.
4498920	4499920	I need more roughage.
4499920	4501920	I just shot a fawn.
4501920	4502920	My brother...
4502920	4503920	I just shoot...
4503920	4504920	Wanna go hunting?
4504920	4506920	Meet me in the kitchen.
4506920	4507920	My brother...
4507920	4512920	So, we're leaving, and my friend Tony goes, he sees this woodchuck.
4512920	4513920	And he goes, what is that?
4513920	4514920	That's a woodchuck?
4514920	4515920	And my brother goes, yeah.
4515920	4518920	And then we're driving down the driveway, and we just hear...
4518920	4519920	Kaboom!
4519920	4521920	And Tony's like, I fingered that woodchuck?
4521920	4522920	I go, yeah.
4522920	4524920	Yeah, that woodchuck's dead.
4524920	4526920	You pointed him out.
4526920	4528920	Yeah, you squealed on that woodchuck.
4528920	4533920	That woodchuck would have had a long life, but you pointed him out to my brother.
4533920	4538920	And when he died, the priest at the funeral was like, Tommy loved outdoors, and he loved
4538920	4539920	animals.
4539920	4542920	And then I went out after the priest in church, which is weird.
4542920	4547920	And I go, my brother, he loved to kill animals, father.
4547920	4550920	He loved to do it indoors, mostly.
4550920	4554920	There's a lot of deer out in the woods going, whoo!
4554920	4555920	Wow.
4555920	4557920	All right, all right.
4557920	4560920	Did you think I came from normal stock?
4560920	4561920	I always...
4561920	4566920	I would have pictured that your brother of yours would have a cardigan and have a den
4566920	4570920	and three kids that he never hit, you know.
4570920	4576920	So he would always bring over bikers, and my mother would be like, you can't wear that
4576920	4579920	Harley's the best, fuck the rest t-shirt in my house.
4579920	4583920	So they would wear t-shirts inside out and be like, this is low life.
4583920	4584920	You've met little shit.
4584920	4585920	This is big shit.
4585920	4586920	This is Beaver.
4586920	4588920	These would be all of his friends.
4588920	4590920	Little shit and big shit?
4590920	4592920	Yeah, they both shits were there.
4592920	4594920	Are they brothers?
4594920	4595920	Oh, when my brother died...
4595920	4596920	Are they related?
4596920	4598920	No, but when my brother died, I didn't know how to find these guys.
4598920	4600920	I go, I don't know who Beaver really is.
4600920	4601920	What's his name?
4601920	4604920	It'd be funny if you looked at the book, and it was just Beaver.
4604920	4605920	Big shit.
4605920	4606920	Big shit.
4606920	4608920	Shit come a little, you know.
4608920	4609920	Yeah, shit come a little.
4609920	4611920	There's like three of them, and you have to call them.
4611920	4612920	Are you the...
4612920	4613920	Are you the shit...
4613920	4615920	Are you from the Hampton Shits?
4615920	4616920	Yeah.
4616920	4618920	And one's just Jason shit.
4622920	4625920	A family of all deer that have been dropped.
4625920	4626920	Or shot.
4626920	4627920	Sorry, you don't drop, dears.
4627920	4628920	You shoot them.
4628920	4629920	All right.
4629920	4631920	All right, Spencer, go.
4634920	4635920	When we last met.
4635920	4637920	Do we have D&D music?
4637920	4638920	Okay.
4638920	4640920	Do you wish I should paint the character sheets go?
4640920	4642920	Yeah, I should because...
4642920	4643920	Holy shit.
4643920	4646920	I had a plus one versus a pussy.
4646920	4650920	Seeing that I'm Jeff, please give me that character sheet.
4650920	4651920	I don't know.
4651920	4653920	Where did Jeff leave off?
4653920	4654920	We'll find out.
4654920	4656920	He'll recap it for us.
4657920	4658920	All right.
4658920	4659920	All right.
4659920	4660920	Go ahead, Spencer.
4660920	4661920	You can recap it.
4661920	4662920	I'm about to.
4663920	4669920	Last time on Harmon Town, our party had been defeated by a squad of blade-armed shadows.
4669920	4675920	Choked to unconsciousness by acrid shadowy smoke and lacerated by many bladed limbs.
4675920	4680920	The gang was unconsciously dragged off into the darkness beyond the Ebon King.
4680920	4683920	Our gang awoke, hurting and exhausted.
4683920	4684920	This is kind of funky.
4685920	4686920	I dig it, though.
4686920	4692920	In the middle of a massive circular ring, crowds of shadows were in attendance watching the center of the ring.
4692920	4699920	Our heroes quickly discovered they were chained together and anchored to a wall and also guarded by a group of shadow men.
4699920	4701920	Their situation seemed hopeless.
4701920	4706920	They stared intently at a large, breathy-like man who was forced to fight his own shadow.
4706920	4713920	Trying to burst their chains, the group could only struggle in vain as they watched the shadow tear breathy too limb from limb.
4713920	4725920	The shadow triumphantly took to the stands and the shadow men guarding our heroes dragged them towards the center ring.
4725920	4727920	They were met by familiar faces.
4727920	4730920	It was their own shadows.
4731920	4733920	Combat is now.
4733920	4735920	Fighting is happening.
4735920	4738920	Battle is current.
4739920	4746920	Wow, you kind of synced up as much as possible, even when there's some weird public domain...
4746920	4748920	Yeah, fuck music.
4749920	4754920	Your dungeon master recap still comes in at a punctuated time.
4754920	4757920	Did you see I got my special D&D gold microphone?
4757920	4761920	I'm like an asshole at the bar who brings his own cue stick, you know?
4763920	4764920	I had to switch it out.
4765920	4767920	Visual jokes were great on podcasts.
4768920	4769920	That mic is so much better.
4769920	4770920	Thank you.
4770920	4772920	Could you just leave it on?
4773920	4776920	It's fairly standard to just leave it on.
4778920	4779920	He's trying to point it out.
4779920	4780920	He's not as human.
4781920	4785920	All right, so we're all unchained and we're all facing shadow versions of ourselves.
4785920	4787920	Yeah, you guys faced off.
4787920	4790920	Mulran, you were piloted by, was it Denise?
4790920	4791920	Yeah, Denise.
4791920	4795920	Yeah, you were piloted by Denise and you fired off some arrows.
4795920	4801920	And he hit one of the shadows with your arrows and then they fired arrows and then it was fighting time.
4801920	4802920	All right, thanks Denise.
4802920	4804920	Hey, what time is it?
4804920	4805920	Fighting time.
4805920	4808920	No, no, I wasn't trying to whoop up the ground.
4809920	4811920	Is it night or day?
4811920	4813920	Who let the dogs out?
4813920	4815920	Fighting time.
4816920	4817920	It's getting ready to rumble.
4817920	4818920	I need to know.
4819920	4824920	It's the shadowy kind of purgatory-like realm where it's always gray and black.
4824920	4828920	It would be more like nighttime, but at the same time there's kind of like a...
4828920	4829920	No, it's just dark.
4829920	4830920	It's fighting time.
4830920	4832920	But if it's dark, how can we see shadows?
4832920	4834920	Is it CPO, like Bob's dreams?
4835920	4841920	You are a gnome and you have low light vision, which lets you see a little bit better than your average person.
4841920	4843920	So you can kind of see these, you know.
4843920	4846920	Yeah, that's why I noticed that I've got that ability.
4847920	4850920	It's all on my shoulders, really.
4851920	4853920	Tiny, short shoulders.
4853920	4856920	You're like three feet tall, by the way.
4856920	4858920	It's a character I'm playing.
4859920	4861920	Yeah, okay.
4861920	4865920	Because a lot of these people have never been exposed to me and I don't want you putting it out.
4865920	4866920	That's how you walk in.
4866920	4868920	They think I'm Danny DeVito right now.
4868920	4871920	Do they think you're like way closer?
4872920	4875920	Do you look normal-sized like Gandalf?
4877920	4879920	That's a perspective joke.
4883920	4887920	And sorry to ask this again, but as you know, I'm sometimes drunk when we're playing.
4887920	4891920	I got my... we got our spells kind of reset a little bit.
4891920	4895920	Yeah, you guys regained all your health and your spells came back.
4896920	4903920	I don't know if it was your chains dissolving or the dark sun shining, but one of the two did it.
4903920	4904920	You know what it is.
4905920	4906920	I don't recall.
4906920	4910920	I explicitly said one of those two and I currently don't remember.
4910920	4912920	Spencer, what's Coco's status?
4912920	4914920	Is she fighting her own shadow?
4914920	4919920	You have shadow Coco, but there isn't like a shadow Coco doppelganger facing her down.
4919920	4923920	Okay, but shadow Coco's good or she's suddenly like, oh, shadow Coco.
4923920	4924920	She hasn't turned on you yet.
4924920	4925920	I mean, who knows, man?
4925920	4930920	Okay, so what are we going to do to get an initiative or who's going first?
4930920	4933920	Where I went first, I like to just go in towards me order.
4933920	4935920	So I'm going to go to you next.
4935920	4936920	All right.
4936920	4938920	I got this level three spell called suggestion.
4938920	4939920	Yeah.
4939920	4940920	And I'd like...
4940920	4943920	Is that the kind of spell I could use to maybe turn these guys against each other?
4943920	4945920	A suggestion spell would...
4945920	4950920	It would make him kind of regard you better or like take a... take an action maybe, but
4950920	4952920	it won't let him turn on his friends or like do something.
4952920	4954920	But charm person would do that maybe, right?
4954920	4956920	Maybe, but these aren't people.
4956920	4957920	They're monsters.
4957920	4958920	So is your mama.
4958920	4960920	That's true.
4960920	4961920	Really good stuff.
4961920	4964920	She's a monster.
4964920	4966920	And listen to the podcast.
4966920	4967920	Does she really?
4967920	4968920	Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's great.
4968920	4969920	Does she a monster?
4969920	4970920	No, no, no.
4970920	4971920	Does she send to the podcast?
4971920	4972920	Yeah, yeah.
4972920	4973920	Shout out to Spencer's mom.
4973920	4974920	She's lovely.
4974920	4976920	You monster.
4976920	4977920	She'll hear it.
4977920	4982920	It'll be great.
4982920	4984920	Okay, so yeah, it's still your turn.
4984920	4986920	I don't think you cast anything, right?
4986920	4987920	All right, fuck it.
4987920	4992920	Then speaking of your mama, I would like to cast Summon Monster 3.
4992920	4997920	Oh, your mom's a level three monster.
4997920	5000920	What monster did you want to summon there?
5000920	5001920	How about that?
5001920	5003920	How about that classic?
5003920	5007920	Is there some kind of orangutan or something?
5007920	5011920	How about my scorpions, Keith and David?
5011920	5015920	Yeah, I'll start with Keith.
5015920	5019920	Well, okay, so since you're casting Summon Level 3, you can actually cast two scorpions
5019920	5020920	since they're a lower level.
5020920	5021920	Oh, okay, Keith and David.
5021920	5022920	Yeah, yeah.
5022920	5023920	Bring them from there.
5023920	5028920	Keith and David launch into being and clap slowly towards the foes.
5028920	5031920	They attack Chris de Burgh as well as...
5031920	5032920	What?
5032920	5033920	Oh.
5033920	5034920	Shadow Chris de Burgh.
5034920	5037920	Oh, please say that.
5037920	5039920	Going forward, I will.
5039920	5044920	As well as Shadow Sharpie.
5044920	5048920	Keith makes his mark, but David is not so lucky.
5048920	5053920	Keith deals four damage to Shadow Chris de Burgh.
5053920	5054920	Lame.
5054920	5055920	Yep.
5055920	5063920	At the same time, Shadow Quark leaps across the battlefield and launches himself directly
5063920	5064920	at...
5064920	5065920	No, I'm sorry.
5065920	5066920	Shadow Sharpie.
5066920	5067920	Ah, ah.
5067920	5068920	Shadow Sharpie.
5068920	5069920	Do you want to talk about something tonight?
5069920	5070920	You came late.
5070920	5073920	My mom's a racist, okay?
5073920	5077920	Your mom's gonna love this episode.
5077920	5079920	Is she really?
5079920	5083920	I mean, we all are a little bit, but is your mom more than that?
5083920	5085920	Like, a little bit more than that.
5085920	5088920	Like, okay, tell us about this.
5088920	5091920	She's like, I'm not racist against Mexicans.
5091920	5096920	I just don't like that they all tag our city.
5096920	5100920	That's more than a little racist than average.
5100920	5103920	Oh, my baseline might be off.
5103920	5107920	Yeah, your baseline is off.
5107920	5112920	Has your mom never met any non-tagging Mexicans?
5112920	5115920	You'd think she would come across some at some point.
5115920	5116920	I don't know.
5116920	5117920	I don't know.
5117920	5118920	Those are maracas.
5118920	5120920	They have to be cute.
5120920	5121920	Yeah.
5121920	5123920	He says something very racist.
5123920	5125920	I love you, mom.
5125920	5127920	Oddly enough, she loves Banksy.
5127920	5128920	Yeah.
5129920	5131920	That's a nice white boy doing that.
5131920	5132920	That's cultured, yeah.
5132920	5133920	Yeah, that's an English chap.
5133920	5135920	So you got a little spat with her because you probably said,
5135920	5138920	well, that's not a logical statement,
5138920	5142920	and then you guys got a classic generational, little teddith hat.
5142920	5145920	Yeah, well, in my family, we have this thing where, like,
5145920	5147920	I colloquially use racism as, like, you know,
5147920	5150920	being conscious of race in a kind of denigrating fashion,
5150920	5153920	but the textbook definition of racism is, like,
5153920	5156920	actually finding people of less value.
5156920	5158920	So according to my family, it's fine if you're like,
5158920	5161920	yeah, all Armenians are trying to get your money
5161920	5163920	because that's not necessarily a terrible thing.
5163920	5165920	It's just, like, a generalization.
5165920	5168920	And we don't see it as racist because it's just, like, a racial thing.
5168920	5169920	Yeah, yeah.
5169920	5171920	Since you've moved out a couple weeks ago,
5171920	5173920	have you hung out with your family?
5173920	5176920	I mean, my mom's birthday was not too long ago.
5176920	5177920	No, it wasn't that.
5177920	5178920	It was Mother's Day, huh?
5178920	5179920	Whatever.
5179920	5183920	Some sort of Mother's Center.
5183920	5185920	Some reason I had to go over there.
5185920	5188920	I really wanted a harvest of the uterus.
5188920	5190920	There was pizza.
5190920	5192920	I love when people say really racist stuff,
5192920	5195920	but I was looking for this place,
5195920	5198920	and the guy who was, like, the landlord guy was, like,
5198920	5200920	you know, and it's great, and everything's great.
5200920	5202920	And he's like, you know, I love everyone.
5202920	5204920	You know, all kinds of people live here.
5204920	5207920	I'm not racist, you know, except I don't rent to any Koreans
5207920	5209920	because, you know, everyone hates Koreans.
5209920	5213920	And we were like, I don't know if that's true.
5213920	5215920	Who are you hanging out with?
5215920	5218920	I knew the landlord that would use the term,
5218920	5221920	he kept saying that he didn't like the Mediterranean's.
5221920	5225920	And I had no idea who the Mediterranean's were.
5225920	5226920	That's really it.
5226920	5228920	Those merpeople.
5228920	5230920	That's nice. I like that.
5230920	5234920	That's got to be a hard needle to thread in the grocery store
5234920	5237920	at a glance, you know?
5237920	5239920	Well, I really wanted to play, so I jumped in.
5239920	5241920	Yeah, those Mediterranean's.
5242920	5243920	Who am I slamming?
5243920	5244920	I have no idea.
5244920	5245920	The Greeks.
5245920	5247920	There's a lot of the Mediterranean.
5247920	5249920	Generally swore the people, I think, your mom,
5249920	5251920	is what she's trying to put in that box.
5251920	5254920	Spencer, can I listen to the show with your mom?
5254920	5256920	I would recommend it.
5256920	5257920	This would be a good one.
5257920	5259920	Wait, listen to this part.
5259920	5261920	I'd like to talk about your uterus.
5261920	5263920	My mom doesn't have a uterus.
5263920	5266920	My first two bedroom apartment I got in in Las Villas,
5266920	5270920	the neighbor came over and there was a sign in the driveway,
5270920	5272920	like a construction sign, and they said,
5272920	5274920	you have to move that every time you pull into park
5274920	5277920	and then move it back after you pull your car in.
5277920	5280920	I put it there because, you know, the ethnics,
5280920	5284920	they pull into the driveway and they honk to each other.
5284920	5292920	And it's like, it's one thing to just have a racist thing
5292920	5295920	in your head, but like, he picked something up
5295920	5298920	and moved it because he had come to find something
5298920	5300920	that was true, that when he said it out loud,
5300920	5303920	like, made as much sense as a Dr. Seuss.
5303920	5307920	The ethnics pull in and honk at the other ethnics.
5307920	5309920	These are not stereotypes.
5309920	5311920	You're making it up.
5311920	5313920	You're making up new stereotypes.
5313920	5315920	You know how Russians hate elevators.
5315920	5317920	What? No.
5317920	5320920	Black people have huge knees and they love carrots.
5320920	5323920	I'm friends with Jay Chandrasekhar,
5323920	5326920	who's in Broke Lizard, directed Super Troopers and all of those
5326920	5328920	and he's in those movies.
5328920	5329920	Right after like the terrorist stuff,
5329920	5331920	he was walking outside of a,
5331920	5333920	he like walked out of a convenience store
5333920	5336920	and this group of like three guys were like shaved heads.
5336920	5337920	He was like, oh, fuck.
5337920	5339920	And they were like, you, hey, you fucking doll head,
5339920	5341920	we're gonna shoot you, fucking doll,
5341920	5342920	like yelling stuff at him.
5342920	5348920	And then one guy walked out and was like, Super Troopers.
5348920	5349920	And they were like, we love you.
5349920	5351920	And they got pictures with him.
5351920	5354920	If you're famous enough, they won't be racist to you.
5354920	5357920	Well, here's the equipment for, you know, for years,
5357920	5359920	like I wouldn't even go to a bar or stuff
5359920	5361920	because it'd just be like all these knucklehead jocks,
5361920	5363920	like, you know, putting, you know, me in headlocks,
5363920	5365920	going, please, you can't out of me, bro.
5365920	5366920	I can't believe it.
5366920	5369920	You know, and it sounds like a weird thing to complain about
5369920	5372920	to 25 year olds, but it's a real thing in my life.
5372920	5376920	So I was in a bar and I'm walking and I see the dudes,
5376920	5378920	they're coming, right?
5378920	5379920	And it's gonna happen.
5379920	5382920	I can smell, I know, I know them now so well
5382920	5383920	and they're heading towards me.
5383920	5384920	And they go, Bobcat.
5384920	5385920	I go, hi.
5385920	5386920	How'd they go?
5386920	5389920	Nobody makes dark comedies like you, bro.
5389920	5390920	Oh.
5390920	5393920	And I go, what was the fucking point?
5393920	5395920	Why did I change careers?
5395920	5397920	It doesn't matter.
5397920	5399920	I should have done dancing with the stars.
5399920	5400920	It really doesn't matter.
5400920	5401920	Yeah.
5401920	5403920	World's greatest dad was the bomb.
5403920	5404920	Yeah.
5404920	5405920	I was like, oh, it really doesn't matter.
5405920	5407920	Those broken glasses in the library
5407920	5411920	at the Twilight Zone.
5411920	5412920	I think it's your turn, right?
5412920	5414920	I was still going.
5414920	5415920	Yeah.
5415920	5416920	Yeah.
5416920	5418920	Launching himself directly at Sharpie.
5418920	5420920	Shadow Sharpie's arms are reeds
5420920	5422920	and electrical crackling energy.
5422920	5423920	Uh-oh.
5423920	5424920	Yeah.
5424920	5425920	Let's see.
5425920	5428920	Maybe I can learn some moves from this guy.
5428920	5431920	Yeah, I could get songwriting tips from my guy.
5431920	5432920	Yeah.
5432920	5433920	I can feel the hair.
5433920	5434920	He knows it.
5434920	5435920	It just looks like I'm a coke head
5435920	5437920	because I just can't.
5437920	5438920	You should trim those.
5438920	5439920	I'm sorry.
5439920	5440920	It's fine.
5440920	5442920	My grandfather had a lot of hair in their ears,
5442920	5444920	and I would always make fun of him.
5444920	5447920	And it's fucking happening, you guys.
5447920	5448920	Yeah.
5448920	5450920	It's associated with math teachers.
5450920	5452920	As soon as I saw the math teacher thing,
5452920	5454920	his hair was working.
5454920	5456920	That's another stereotype.
5456920	5457920	Yeah.
5457920	5459920	Fuck those guys with Mediterranean math teachers.
5459920	5462920	Oh, they love to honk.
5462920	5465920	Those dirty honking Mediterranean math teachers.
5465920	5467920	Two plus two is Algo.
5467920	5469920	I don't know what the Mediterranean says.
5469920	5470920	Hi.
5470920	5471920	I love olives.
5471920	5473920	Cocoa butter.
5473920	5476920	Give me more cocoa butter.
5476920	5479920	It's so hot down here.
5479920	5480920	So he attacked.
5480920	5482920	And he misses.
5482920	5485920	He flies directly and lands belly first in the dirt.
5485920	5489920	I'm putting it at Quark's turn, who's played by you.
5489920	5490920	All right.
5490920	5494920	So I want to cast a spell.
5494920	5498920	I think it's a one.
5498920	5500920	And it's the dancing lights.
5500920	5501920	Yeah.
5501920	5508920	So dancing lights conjures several dancing lights.
5508920	5509920	I knew that.
5509920	5512920	And so if you do that, you'll be able to control them
5512920	5514920	and make them kind of move around and dance.
5514920	5517920	Really, I'm trying to confuse and make the...
5517920	5519920	Are you trying to start a party?
5519920	5523920	I want the shadows to disappear with the lights.
5523920	5524920	All right.
5524920	5525920	I like that.
5525920	5526920	That's not bad.
5526920	5527920	No, it's great.
5527920	5528920	I like that.
5528920	5530920	Summoning four several teeny bursts of light.
5530920	5533920	Can I say dancing queen while this happens?
5533920	5534920	I'd recommend it.
5534920	5535920	They're going to be distracted.
5535920	5536920	Yeah.
5536920	5537920	Yeah.
5537920	5538920	I'll say dancing queen just to distract them.
5538920	5541920	You notice your lights are rather supernaturally dim.
5541920	5544920	They don't even seem to be lighting up much at all.
5544920	5547920	Oh, yeah.
5547920	5552920	It's as if the shadow plane dampens lights.
5552920	5554920	Now we both look like dragons.
5554920	5556920	Oh, that's a drag.
5556920	5558920	Sorry, y'all.
5558920	5561920	At the same time, Shadow Quark launches himself
5561920	5565920	at real-time Christoper and swinging his blade wickedly.
5565920	5567920	Oh, wow.
5567920	5570920	Striking Christoper squarely in his jaw.
5570920	5574920	It's a bad place to strike squarely.
5574920	5576920	Dealing seven damage.
5576920	5577920	Well, you decided that.
5577920	5579920	The guy didn't say John.
5579920	5581920	I have a dice that says John.
5581920	5582920	Do you really?
5582920	5583920	No.
5583920	5584920	Okay.
5584920	5587920	Well, you stole the shit out of that.
5587920	5590920	He should have held up his fist when he said that.
5590920	5593920	I got a dice that says John with your name on it.
5593920	5599920	It's got two sides, your face, and it hits your ass.
5599920	5600920	All right.
5600920	5601920	So that happens.
5601920	5603920	Putting it at Christoperg's turn.
5603920	5604920	All right.
5604920	5605920	Well, I don't really have...
5605920	5607920	Oh, I have a poison dagger.
5607920	5608920	True.
5608920	5610920	I tie a rope to it.
5610920	5611920	God damn it.
5611920	5613920	I can throw a dagger, right?
5613920	5614920	You can throw a dagger.
5614920	5615920	Yeah.
5615920	5623920	So I tie it to a rope, and I throw it at...
5623920	5624920	Which one's closest to me?
5624920	5625920	Which one's the biggest target?
5625920	5627920	The closest is Shadow Sharpie right now.
5627920	5628920	All right.
5628920	5630920	Can I just stab Shadow Sharpie with it?
5630920	5631920	Please.
5631920	5632920	Am I close enough to stab him?
5632920	5633920	You could, yeah.
5633920	5634920	Yeah.
5634920	5635920	Let's just do that.
5635920	5638920	All right.
5638920	5642920	I still tie the rope just because I like that.
5642920	5647920	All right.
5647920	5652920	You stab Shadow Sharpie in the gut with your dagger.
5652920	5657920	The poison soaks into his body, and he takes six damage.
5657920	5658920	All right.
5658920	5663920	He doesn't seem to be affected by the poison, which is weird.
5663920	5664920	It happens.
5664920	5665920	What about the rope?
5665920	5668920	The rope is still attached to the knife, I imagine.
5668920	5671920	He doesn't seem to be affected by the rope.
5671920	5674920	Is that so you can pull your dagger back?
5674920	5675920	Yeah.
5675920	5676920	So I can throw it and then pull it back.
5676920	5677920	Why don't you use...
5677920	5678920	It's not a string.
5678920	5682920	You should have used tying a rope that would be thicker than a knife, tying it to a...
5682920	5683920	You should have used bungee.
5683920	5684920	Paper.
5684920	5685920	It's like Scorpion.
5685920	5686920	Do you know Mortal Kombat?
5686920	5687920	Get over here.
5687920	5689920	I'm trying to do that move.
5689920	5692920	Shadow Christopher hides among the shadows.
5692920	5696920	You should have tied it to a boomerang.
5696920	5698920	I don't have a boomerang.
5698920	5700920	A boomerang will come back anyway.
5700920	5703920	Yeah, but you tie a knife to a boomerang.
5703920	5707920	That will fuck a bitch up.
5707920	5708920	A knife-a-rang.
5708920	5709920	A knife-a-rang.
5709920	5713920	We got to patent this.
5713920	5714920	Putting it in.
5714920	5717920	Mulrain's turn.
5717920	5722920	What is Shadow Coco's relationship with Shadow Mulrain?
5722920	5726920	That would not be something you could divine in a glance or two.
5726920	5729920	Interesting.
5729920	5730920	Coco.
5730920	5733920	I feel like you're jealous of Shadow Mulrain.
5733920	5735920	I like her very first.
5735920	5736920	I mean, she looks thinner.
5736920	5737920	She's so dark.
5737920	5738920	Yeah.
5738920	5743920	That's very...
5743920	5744920	Coco.
5744920	5746920	Shadow Coco.
5746920	5753920	Will you approach Mulrain and try to get Shadow Mulrain and get her to mount you?
5753920	5755920	Yes.
5755920	5757920	Shadow Coco doesn't talk.
5757920	5759920	Well, does she do it?
5759920	5760920	She's slowly...
5760920	5761920	Are you writing her?
5761920	5763920	Yeah, what are you hoping to accomplish?
5763920	5764920	I have a plan, you guys.
5764920	5766920	Well, are you writing her?
5766920	5767920	Am I writing her?
5767920	5768920	No, I am not writing her.
5768920	5769920	Yeah, she walks off a little.
5769920	5771920	Okay, well, can I tell her my entire plan then?
5771920	5773920	No, she's already doing it.
5773920	5775920	You could call it out to her.
5775920	5777920	Well, then the shadows will hear.
5777920	5779920	All right, fine.
5779920	5784920	Well, I'm able to control my voice in a way where she hears me and the shadows don't hear me.
5784920	5785920	That's a little quick.
5785920	5786920	Coco.
5786920	5790920	Coco, this is my idea.
5790920	5796920	You're going to approach Shadow Mulrain and do that thing with your back that makes us
5796920	5798920	want to mount you.
5798920	5801920	Are we here in Eclipse?
5801920	5804920	No, no, you're in the middle of a giant arena-type thing.
5804920	5805920	Oh, an arena.
5805920	5806920	But there are walls to the arena.
5806920	5807920	There are giant walls.
5807920	5808920	They're really far off though.
5808920	5810920	Okay, well, no, that's fine because Coco's fast.
5810920	5811920	Yeah.
5811920	5814920	Coco, you're going to get Shadow Mulrain to mount you.
5814920	5818920	And then I know how we always talk about physics when we're writing.
5818920	5823920	You're going to run as fast as you can towards one of the walls and stop just short of the
5823920	5824920	wall.
5824920	5831920	And then Shadow Mulrain will fly into the wall and surely die 100%.
5831920	5833920	Yeah, do you have...
5834920	5837920	Do you have that die, Spencer?
5840920	5844920	That's just a coin flip for that.
5844920	5851920	Anyway, yeah, so she hears your plan, presumably, and is trotting off, you know, and then kind
5851920	5854920	of looks at Shadow Mulrain.
5854920	5858920	I mean, horses can't really communicate very well, especially when they...
5858920	5861920	Well, you have not looked in the face of a horse, my friend.
5862920	5864920	This doesn't really have, like, a countenance.
5864920	5866920	It's, like, just dull black.
5866920	5867920	But it's Shadow to Shadow.
5867920	5868920	That's true.
5868920	5869920	That's true.
5869920	5873920	Why doesn't it do the thing with the bag that makes us want to mount them?
5877920	5880920	You could get some direct quote.
5884920	5889920	All right, well, as, you know, Shadow Coco approaches, Mulrain kind of gets jumpy.
5889920	5893920	Shadow Mulrain fires off three arrows at Shadow.
5895920	5897920	Things happen, you guys.
5900920	5903920	All the ladies in the audience are like, God, the horse, the horse.
5903920	5905920	I'm dealing 20 damage.
5907920	5908920	Shadow Coco.
5909920	5911920	Can we just turn on a light?
5911920	5913920	Does anyone have a light?
5913920	5915920	That's what Disco Boy tried to do.
5915920	5916920	I tried.
5916920	5917920	We all tried that.
5917920	5920920	Everyone tries with the light, and it's just, the light doesn't work here.
5920920	5924920	It's not, I mean, Jesus Christ, if a book of matches would make you a god here.
5924920	5928920	I mean, it's not like having a bucket of water in witch world.
5928920	5930920	Shadow Coco stumbles.
5930920	5931920	This is Avengers.
5932920	5933920	Duh.
5933920	5934920	Putting it, it sure is true.
5934920	5935920	You know, that old saying.
5935920	5936920	Yeah.
5937920	5938920	Didn't the water melt the witch?
5938920	5939920	Yeah.
5939920	5941920	Yes, the water melted a witch baby.
5943920	5945920	Don't like being patronized.
5947920	5949920	Did baby make that better or worse?
5951920	5952920	It worked for me.
5952920	5954920	You would have me right around my finger.
5954920	5955920	I'd be, all right.
5956920	5958920	She called me baby.
5958920	5960920	You like me.
5961920	5964920	I have these fat baby fingers, and I have hair coming out of my nose.
5964920	5966920	That's all you thought, going right back to your fingers.
5966920	5969920	She says, she calls me baby, because my fingers...
5969920	5972920	Because when I touch her, she thinks there's a baby molesting me.
5972920	5974920	You're being fondled by a baby.
5974920	5975920	And a beard.
5975920	5976920	A baby with a beard.
5978920	5982920	I always pictured my hands as like Hugh Laurie's hands.
5982920	5985920	I thought the funniest thing that you said about your fingers today was that you were like,
5985920	5988920	yeah, I had never seen my hands before, because you know, when you're standing in the mirror,
5988920	5989920	you don't look at your hands.
5989920	5990920	And I was just like, what?
5990920	5992920	I was like, I know exactly what my hands look like.
5992920	5997920	It's just literally a saying that goes, I know it as well as the back of my hand.
5998920	6000920	But it's not the tips.
6000920	6004920	It's flattering, because it means that you're not.
6004920	6008920	You're not vain at all, which is the reason why I was worried about the nose hairs,
6008920	6009920	because I love you.
6009920	6011920	I don't care what you look like, ever.
6011920	6016920	But the nose hair thing, the second I saw one, I was like, well, that's it.
6016920	6019920	There's going to be a waterfall of hair.
6019920	6023920	Did you ever think that that's where he gets his power?
6024920	6027920	If you pull those nose hairs out, and he'd be like...
6027920	6029920	A nasal samsung?
6029920	6033920	To bring it all together, I once saw a baby with nose hair.
6033920	6034920	Really?
6034920	6036920	Have you ever shook a little person's hand?
6036920	6038920	You must have been in the Mediterranean.
6038920	6039920	Have you ever shook a...
6039920	6040920	Yeah, with their nose hair, baby.
6040920	6044920	Have you ever shook a little person's hand, and their fingers are like cocktail wieners?
6045920	6047920	Do you know what I mean? They're really stubby?
6047920	6048920	Yeah, they're soft.
6048920	6053920	And I'm like trying to be cool, but I'm like, your fingers are like cocktail wieners.
6054920	6056920	I thought of that when I met Billy Barty once.
6056920	6058920	Okay, enough with the name dropping.
6058920	6061920	You wouldn't have to drop that name too far.
6062920	6067920	Billy Barty asked me to go be in his pro-am golf tournament,
6067920	6069920	and I wrote a letter back saying...
6069920	6070920	Is it mini golf?
6070920	6071920	That's what I said.
6071920	6075920	I said, I'm not trying to be cruel here, but are we talking miniature golf or regular golf?
6075920	6077920	And I never heard back from him.
6077920	6079920	Oh, one more story.
6079920	6082920	Dear Mr. Golf, you were trying to be cool.
6082920	6084920	You know what, I'm not sending this letter.
6084920	6088920	What's funny is he got that response from every single person.
6088920	6092920	Okay, back at my brother's funeral, and I'll be off of it.
6092920	6094920	I just wanted to bring everyone up again.
6094920	6100920	One of his pallbearers was a little person, and nobody gave us a heads up, so...
6101920	6103920	I looked out, and there's...
6104920	6105920	And I go...
6105920	6107920	I thought it was a tune. I go to my daughter.
6107920	6111920	I go, it looks like little Ricky's riding a subway,
6111920	6113920	because he was hanging on the...
6114920	6120920	And then my daughter goes, he just got air.
6125920	6129920	The alternative is holding the coffin really low.
6129920	6131920	Or riding it.
6131920	6133920	That's how my brother would have liked it.
6133920	6135920	On a shopping cart, there's a little chair.
6135920	6139920	Okay, he's riding it with some sort of rifle with a scope.
6139920	6141920	That's how my brother would have appreciated it.
6141920	6143920	If you're a little person, and you're listening to the podcast,
6143920	6146920	and you'd like to come down to Hermit Town, I'll fly you out,
6146920	6150920	and buy you drinks for the last five minutes of the film.
6150920	6153920	You don't have that kind of money, do you?
6153920	6157920	Your target audience is little people.
6158920	6161920	Are you saying because you can put two of them in a seat?
6163920	6166920	I genuinely feel bad. There's got to be one.
6166920	6169920	There are a lot of wonderful little people in Los Angeles.
6169920	6170920	I know some little people.
6170920	6172920	I do too, but I don't feel like...
6172920	6173920	It's such a weird thing to say.
6173920	6176920	It's so weird that little people is the politically correct thing to say,
6176920	6178920	because it feels so demeaning.
6178920	6179920	That seems even bad.
6179920	6181920	I mean, honestly, my brother...
6181920	6183920	Let's just call it dinklages.
6183920	6184920	Wait.
6184920	6185920	My brother is a little person.
6185920	6187920	Can I just say this?
6187920	6190920	He's not, but what if he was?
6190920	6195920	A good fourth of this show is dedicated to you guys playing dwarfs,
6195920	6198920	and your goblins, and little people.
6198920	6201920	So I think you're down with the little people.
6203920	6205920	When they have hours.
6205920	6207920	They're one of the last...
6207920	6209920	Nice play on words, by the way.
6209920	6212920	Overweight people and little people.
6212920	6214920	Down with little people.
6214920	6216920	But those seem to be...
6216920	6218920	Never mind. We'll move on.
6218920	6220920	I'm not against them.
6222920	6224920	I love their little faces.
6224920	6225920	I want to squeeze them.
6225920	6227920	None of this is helping.
6228920	6230920	I love the rum to their little heads.
6230920	6234920	I once had a higher one to play a pig when I was shooting this thing called...
6234920	6236920	None of this is helping.
6236920	6238920	I was doing this thing called Houdini the Pig,
6238920	6240920	where I had an escape out of this pig.
6240920	6242920	Can I know you're gonna fly five of them down now?
6242920	6244920	All right, we can keep going.
6244920	6248920	Does anyone know about the little person neighborhood in San Diego?
6248920	6249920	Yeah.
6249920	6250920	That's a thing.
6250920	6255920	There's a street that was made by Disney, or Theater Geisel.
6255920	6257920	I think it's Theater Geisel.
6257920	6258920	Really?
6258920	6259920	Yeah, worthy.
6259920	6262920	What if you just stumbled into that area and you didn't know?
6262920	6266920	Well, you'd feel delighted and joyful.
6266920	6272920	The houses are custom-made for little people, so the doors are smaller.
6272920	6279920	So he was pro-Star Belly Sneetches, not mixing with the other Star Belly Sneetches?
6279920	6281920	Well, I don't think it was like a ghetto.
6281920	6283920	It was like...
6283920	6286920	There wasn't a wall around it.
6286920	6287920	No one was sent there.
6287920	6292920	They had a two-and-a-half-foot wall.
6292920	6294920	They're just keeping their money little.
6294920	6300920	They're doing what the Irish, you know, and the Italians did.
6300920	6303920	We really helped this 100%.
6303920	6310920	Guys, let's cut this conversation short and move on.
6310920	6312920	Hold on to me, Kumail!
6312920	6313920	Can I just say this?
6313920	6318920	They were fine with all the bad, negative things we were saying about little people,
6318920	6321920	but it was a pun that broke the class.
6321920	6322920	That's what kills it.
6322920	6325920	So I did it to kill it, and now we move on.
6325920	6328920	They're fine with a form of racism, but a pun!
6328920	6330920	Ow, that hurt my brain!
6330920	6332920	Because puns are really the hardest...
6332920	6333920	The puns hold up a mirror.
6333920	6337920	They're the hardest jokes to write, but they're the most loathed.
6337920	6339920	Are they really the hardest to write, though?
6339920	6340920	Really?
6340920	6341920	I find them hard.
6342920	6344920	I guess good ones, I don't know.
6344920	6346920	I see why they're in low humor, because they're like,
6346920	6348920	well, they don't elicit any joy.
6348920	6352920	They just make you go, uh, you connected a dot.
6352920	6353920	I see what you did there.
6353920	6357920	Maybe they're not the hardest ones to write, but they're the hardest ones to do right.
6361920	6362920	Sorry.
6362920	6363920	All right.
6363920	6364920	It was a filibuster.
6364920	6365920	What's going on?
6365920	6366920	What's the game?
6366920	6367920	Sharpies turn.
6367920	6372920	Okay, I'm going to, uh, uh, uh, take a page from my Shadow Selves Playbook,
6372920	6374920	and I'm gonna cast...
6374920	6375920	Is he still laying there?
6375920	6376920	He's still laying there.
6376920	6379920	I'm gonna hit him with the shocking grasp.
6379920	6380920	All right.
6380920	6384920	You find him much easier to hit lying on the ground.
6385920	6387920	That's what I said in college.
6388920	6389920	Okay.
6396920	6399920	Electricity surges through your arm and flows into the, uh,
6399920	6401920	lying on the ground wizard.
6401920	6402920	It's my comedy.
6402920	6404920	Twenty damage.
6409920	6414920	Sharpie leaps to his feet and taking a step back,
6414920	6415920	waves his arm.
6415920	6417920	Uh, waves is just the one arm, I guess.
6417920	6418920	Yeah.
6418920	6420920	Casting a fireball spell.
6420920	6425920	It flies into the middle of your group and, uh, hits friend and foe alike.
6425920	6426920	This is the Shadow Sharpie.
6426920	6428920	Yeah, Shadow Sharpie.
6429920	6431920	It's a good move, fireball.
6431920	6432920	Yeah.
6432920	6435920	You still have respect for the Shadow guys?
6435920	6437920	That's good stuff.
6437920	6441920	Everybody but Shadow Christopher gets hit for damage.
6441920	6443920	Fuck yeah.
6444920	6446920	No, you got hit too.
6446920	6447920	No.
6447920	6448920	Shadow Christopher.
6448920	6449920	Yeah.
6449920	6450920	Fuck.
6450920	6452920	Fuck yeah.
6452920	6454920	I love to get hit.
6455920	6457920	Hurt me good.
6461920	6462920	Okay.
6462920	6465920	Um, real quark takes 20 damage.
6465920	6466920	Oh.
6466920	6469920	Real Sharpie takes 14 damage.
6469920	6470920	Oh.
6470920	6471920	I gotta write this down.
6471920	6472920	20.
6472920	6473920	Uh, 14.
6473920	6474920	17.
6474920	6475920	20.
6475920	6476920	Okay.
6476920	6478920	That's not helping.
6478920	6480920	We can all say that, right?
6480920	6483920	And real Moraine takes 13 damage.
6483920	6485920	And real, did I say real quark yet?
6485920	6486920	No.
6486920	6488920	Real Christopher takes some damage as well.
6488920	6489920	How much?
6489920	6490920	15.
6490920	6491920	15?
6491920	6492920	Yeah.
6492920	6493920	So we all got kind of fucked up.
6493920	6499920	But at the same time, um, our Shadow Quark also takes, oh, that's not bad, 22 damage.
6499920	6500920	Yeah.
6500920	6501920	Alright.
6502920	6504920	Oh, uh, he's almost dead, guys.
6504920	6505920	Cool.
6505920	6506920	You guys are almost winning a fight.
6506920	6508920	This is awesome.
6509920	6512920	Can we just bring up earlier fights we've had with them?
6512920	6514920	Make them feel bad?
6515920	6516920	I guess.
6516920	6517920	That could happen.
6517920	6519920	Putting it at Quark's turn.
6519920	6520920	Alright.
6520920	6525920	So, um, so Shadow, I'm gonna attack Shadow Quark.
6526920	6528920	Uh, cause I can move really fast.
6528920	6529920	Yeah.
6529920	6532920	I'm gonna hit him with my, uh, nut sack.
6533920	6536920	You aren't as proficient with your nut sack as you are a sword.
6536920	6537920	Hmm.
6537920	6538920	Okay.
6538920	6539920	I mean, you could do either.
6539920	6540920	Well, maybe.
6540920	6541920	Yeah.
6541920	6543920	Could I hit him with my six knives?
6543920	6544920	Yes.
6544920	6545920	Okay.
6545920	6546920	That's what I'm gonna hit him with.
6546920	6548920	Does it really say nut sack?
6548920	6549920	Yeah, I have a nut sack.
6549920	6550920	Yeah.
6550920	6554920	It's, it's, he uses it to bribe squirrels that he summons.
6555920	6556920	That was tough.
6556920	6557920	Never brought that up.
6557920	6559920	That really is a sack full of nuts.
6559920	6560920	Okay.
6560920	6561920	Yeah, no.
6561920	6564920	I thought I was gonna teabag my, um...
6565920	6567920	No, you have to wait till they're dead.
6567920	6570920	Otherwise they just attack when they're, when they're down.
6570920	6573920	Is there a water back in the, in the green room there or something?
6573920	6577920	I'm sitting next to this bucket of vodka and I, so my first day of sobriety's not going there.
6577920	6578920	Yeah, the vodka's in there.
6578920	6580920	Getting my ass kicked by Shadow's and...
6581920	6582920	Hello, Dan.
6582920	6583920	I understand you.
6583920	6584920	I'm your friend.
6585920	6586920	I'm your friend.
6586920	6587920	Don't care, Dan.
6588920	6590920	I'm assuming you're attacking with a knife.
6590920	6591920	Yeah, I'm a six knife.
6591920	6592920	I thought that was happening.
6592920	6594920	I'm getting super stabby up here.
6594920	6597920	Getting super stabby indeed.
6597920	6599920	Although just a bit stabby rather.
6599920	6604920	You stab Shadow Quark with your knife, dealing four damage.
6604920	6606920	I'm sorry, six damage.
6606920	6607920	Great.
6607920	6608920	I did math wrong.
6609920	6610920	It happens.
6610920	6614920	How much, how many, how much damage do we have to do to kill these guys?
6614920	6615920	You know, a couple more.
6615920	6616920	Some damage.
6617920	6618920	He makes it up as he does one.
6618920	6619920	Am I, am I wearing...
6619920	6621920	Sixteen, technically.
6621920	6623920	Am I wearing the Cloak of Resistance this entire time?
6623920	6624920	You are indeed.
6624920	6626920	It gives you a plus one to all saves.
6627920	6636920	Shadow Quark not using his knife, instead opting for his flaming sword, attacks real Quark, striking his flank.
6636920	6637920	His flank.
6639920	6640920	Dealing eight damage.
6641920	6643920	Everyone's getting destroyed right now.
6643920	6644920	This is awesome.
6648920	6650920	Putting it at Christoper's turn.
6650920	6651920	All right.
6651920	6653920	Well, I take, I have a bola.
6653920	6656920	That's, that's like a cat of nine tails kind of thing.
6656920	6660920	It's like, it's two weights tied together by a cord.
6660920	6661920	Oh, so it doesn't hurt.
6661920	6662920	It just...
6662920	6663920	It'll do a bit of damage.
6663920	6665920	It'll trip people up, knock people down.
6665920	6667920	I think you forgot my scorpion's a couple of...
6667920	6670920	It gives it the Tombowomba effect.
6671920	6672920	It's the Tombowomba effect.
6672920	6675920	It'll pick people up and knock them down.
6675920	6676920	And then you get up again.
6676920	6677920	But they'll get up again.
6677920	6678920	But they'll get up again.
6678920	6679920	That's the problem.
6679920	6680920	It's kind of useless.
6686920	6689920	When I was in middle school, I went to go buy the Tombowomba CD.
6689920	6694920	But the cover of it was so scary to me because it was like a weird baby and I was, I was about to buy it.
6694920	6696920	And then I was like, I can't, I can't.
6696920	6698920	I can't buy this devil's CD and left it at the thing.
6698920	6699920	Not a good story.
6699920	6700920	That's my one.
6700920	6701920	Well, you dodged a bullet.
6702920	6703920	Yeah.
6703920	6704920	Because it's not...
6704920	6706920	I wonder what the other songs on that CD were.
6707920	6708920	No one knows.
6708920	6710920	It's all that song over and over.
6713920	6715920	I think that band was kind of like some kind of like a hard...
6715920	6717920	They were like, they were not the kind of band that you'd expect.
6717920	6720920	Like that was like the weird random thing they did.
6720920	6721920	They wanted to be the Sex Pistols.
6721920	6722920	Yeah.
6722920	6723920	They were very political.
6723920	6724920	Were they really?
6724920	6725920	Oh, that's what it was.
6725920	6726920	Yeah.
6726920	6727920	And then that was what hit, you know.
6727920	6728920	That sucks.
6729920	6734920	It's like being a big who fan and then a squeeze box gets played on the radio.
6734920	6737920	And you have to explain to your friends, they don't suck.
6739920	6741920	What did the scorpions do?
6741920	6743920	Oh, they're going to go after you.
6743920	6749920	So if I can use the bolas and get one of them on the ground, then Sharpie could electrocute them, right?
6749920	6751920	Sharpie, what do you think of that plan?
6751920	6752920	Can I use shopping...
6754920	6756920	Can I use shopping grasp again?
6756920	6758920	Yeah, yeah, that's a level one spell.
6758920	6761920	You got quite a few of those to my... as far as I know.
6761920	6764920	And he got someone's babysitter's calling and going,
6764920	6766920	What happened to you?
6769920	6773920	You owe me $600 and I put your baby in the oven.
6775920	6778920	Because I was 13 when I got the job and now I'm experimenting with acid.
6780920	6782920	I'm saying the show's going long.
6783920	6785920	Hello?
6785920	6789920	That was a really fully fleshed out person on the other end of that call.
6790920	6792920	They had a whole art of backstory.
6792920	6797920	I'm going to make a request to the Tumblr community to unpack that with pictures.
6797920	6803920	So I do the bola and I get one of them down.
6803920	6804920	Which one?
6804920	6805920	Which one?
6805920	6807920	Let's do one that has good health.
6807920	6808920	Good health.
6808920	6811920	That would be mole rain or you can't see your doppelganger.
6811920	6813920	So probably mole rain or Sharpie.
6813920	6815920	Let's do Sharpie.
6815920	6816920	Alright.
6816920	6818920	Because he fucked us with those fireball things.
6818920	6819920	Yeah, he did.
6820920	6821920	Yeah, you hit him.
6821920	6822920	Okay.
6822920	6828920	It strikes his legs and it wraps around his legs and with a start he falls over,
6828920	6834920	kind of like a felled tree striking the ground with great vigor and a plumb.
6834920	6835920	Great.
6836920	6839920	Sharpie, next time you can just go over and...
6839920	6846920	Keith and David, the scorpions, wheel around and pull up on Quark, Shadow Quark rather,
6846920	6848920	and strike his surface.
6852920	6856920	That sounded a lot more feasible in my headspace.
6857920	6860920	For the purist, I already rolled the attacks earlier.
6860920	6862920	I'm not just bullshitting this.
6862920	6864920	Dealing two and five damage to Quark.
6865920	6867920	Oh man, why always me?
6867920	6868920	Oh, Shadow Quark, sorry.
6868920	6870920	This is very confusing.
6870920	6872920	I need to get a diagram.
6872920	6875920	Man, these scorpions suck as much as the band.
6875920	6877920	Some monsters aren't that great, yeah.
6877920	6879920	But it happens.
6879920	6883920	Do you want another turn or should we cut it soon?
6883920	6887920	Well, I'd like to go.
6887920	6888920	I bet.
6888920	6890920	Like leave or do a turn?
6890920	6891920	No, do a turn.
6891920	6892920	I'd like to have a turn.
6892920	6893920	Alright.
6893920	6896920	Do you have to shoot some deer?
6896920	6899920	You've got to blast him.
6900920	6902920	Is there a toilet nearby?
6902920	6904920	You murdered some deer.
6904920	6906920	Don't go in there for 20 minutes.
6906920	6909920	Seriously, I shot a bear.
6914920	6916920	I've got to go so bad right now.
6916920	6918920	I'm falling.
6919920	6924920	I'm not going to look at you guys.
6928920	6935920	May I summon the great and powerful marbles, the monkey?
6935920	6936920	Yes.
6940920	6942920	You should have said no.
6943920	6948920	Ooh, aah, shadows, attack, aah!
6948920	6951920	I don't know what I mean.
6951920	6953920	Who are you attacking?
6953920	6955920	We murdered the monkey.
6957920	6959920	Yeah, who are you attacking at?
6959920	6962920	Marbles is going to attack all the shadows.
6962920	6964920	And can I give him some tools?
6964920	6965920	No.
6965920	6968920	Give him a little outfit and a trace of gold.
6968920	6970920	And a mouth gag.
6970920	6972920	Hey man, that's not cool to monkeys.
6972920	6974920	Just the one target.
6974920	6976920	Alright.
6976920	6978920	Who has the most...
6978920	6980920	Maybe the one down on the ground would be...
6980920	6981920	I don't know.
6981920	6982920	I don't know.
6982920	6984920	I just did something I didn't feel like.
6986920	6990920	I send marbles towards...
6990920	6992920	Who's the one down on the ground?
6992920	6994920	Sharpies down, but Quark is almost dead.
6994920	6995920	Yeah.
6995920	6999920	Shadow sharpies on the ground, Quark is on the ropes.
6999920	7000920	Alright.
7000920	7001920	Well, I guess I could do that.
7001920	7002920	Shadow Quark.
7002920	7003920	I really believe in marbles.
7003920	7007920	I think that he could do a lot of damage to someone who had a lot to lose.
7007920	7010920	Sure man, monkeys will fuck you up.
7011920	7013920	Yeah, go for a strong one.
7013920	7014920	Okay.
7014920	7015920	Who's the strongest right now?
7015920	7016920	Mulrane.
7016920	7017920	That's debatable.
7017920	7020920	Probably Mulrane has the most health.
7020920	7021920	I don't know why I'm flattered.
7021920	7022920	I mean, it's not me.
7022920	7024920	Shadow Mulrane.
7024920	7027920	Even Mulrane is not you.
7030920	7031920	What?
7031920	7032920	I...
7037920	7039920	Attack Shadow Mulrane.
7040920	7041920	That happens.
7041920	7042920	Yeah.
7043920	7045920	Bubbles leaps atop Shadow Mulrane.
7045920	7046920	Marbles!
7047920	7048920	Bubbles.
7048920	7050920	Michael Jackson's monkey again.
7050920	7052920	I'm an old man now.
7052920	7053920	No.
7053920	7054920	Bubbles are useless.
7054920	7055920	Marbles hit things.
7055920	7056920	Get everywhere.
7056920	7058920	Was there another set of marbles, summon monsters?
7058920	7059920	Bubbles is useless.
7059920	7060920	I'm done talking.
7060920	7061920	Bubbles is Michael Jackson's.
7061920	7062920	Good night everybody.
7062920	7063920	Hello.
7063920	7064920	No.
7064920	7065920	What if that ended the show?
7065920	7067920	Do you see how quickly they applaud it?
7067920	7068920	Oh good.
7068920	7069920	Yeah, they're like...
7070920	7071920	Yeah, yeah.
7071920	7075920	Okay, so he strikes Shadow Mulrane dealing four damage.
7076920	7077920	Just the four.
7077920	7079920	It's a small monkey.
7079920	7082920	I have giant scorpions and they do like two points of damage.
7082920	7083920	I mean, what do you want?
7083920	7085920	These things happen.
7086920	7087920	It's fine.
7087920	7089920	You have no tools to fight with.
7089920	7091920	Like, you could kill a monkey.
7091920	7094920	I don't understand why I can't give marbles tools.
7094920	7095920	He has hands.
7095920	7096920	He's eager.
7096920	7099920	He's got a great spirit and a great backstory.
7099920	7100920	He's in it for himself.
7100920	7101920	He's like...
7101920	7102920	He just appeared here.
7102920	7105920	He's gonna rip some hair out.
7105920	7109920	He's not looking to apply technology situations.
7109920	7111920	Right, but how do you...
7111920	7113920	So we don't have...
7113920	7116920	He has a t-shirt that says that.
7116920	7121920	Maybe if I summon a monolith, marbles will touch it.
7121920	7123920	Three thousand years from now.
7123920	7127920	Spencer, Spencer, I have a connection to him.
7127920	7129920	Also, I have high nature.
7129920	7130920	Yes, I do.
7130920	7133920	Yes, you can't tell me what I have a connection with and what I don't.
7133920	7137920	I am quite literally, quite figuratively God of this realm.
7143920	7145920	Great work, everyone.
7146920	7150920	But I have handled animal and knowledge of nature.
7150920	7152920	All of these are true.
7152920	7153920	All right.
7153920	7155920	You got her to do something.
7155920	7157920	Without that, it would not even have been four damage.
7157920	7161920	It might not have even known how to use a wrench or whatever.
7161920	7163920	No, it might have failed harder.
7163920	7164920	It could get...
7164920	7168920	If it was fighting termites, you gave it a stick.
7168920	7169920	Yeah.
7169920	7173920	It could possibly use the stick to gather the termites.
7173920	7174920	God damn it.
7174920	7175920	All right.
7175920	7177920	Monkeys rip people's faces off.
7177920	7178920	Yeah.
7178920	7179920	This is a very little monkey.
7179920	7182920	This is like a foot, like a coochin.
7182920	7184920	Oh, have you seen Jumanji?
7186920	7188920	That's not a good conversation story.
7191920	7192920	I'm saying it, Adrian.
7192920	7193920	You're on our first stage.
7193920	7194920	Hi, my name is Troy.
7194920	7195920	Hi, I'm Aaron.
7195920	7197920	Have you seen Jumanji?
7197920	7198920	Terrible icebreaker.
7198920	7200920	Do you even know?
7200920	7202920	Your car will get crushed by a monkey.
7204920	7207920	They'll ruin your dishes, and they'll look like they're having a great time.
7209920	7211920	Robin Williams.
7211920	7213920	Yeah, yes, yes, it is.
7214920	7216920	I can connect us.
7216920	7217920	Did you like that one?
7217920	7218920	All right.
7218920	7219920	Well, we should...
7219920	7220920	I guess we're not going to feed her.
7220920	7223920	I don't want to play Dungeons and Dragons anymore.
7225920	7228920	I know that you wanted to play when you sat down.
7228920	7230920	You did look a little grumpy.
7230920	7231920	That's...
7231920	7232920	We got to...
7232920	7234920	I mean, are you at the end of your role?
7234920	7237920	No, I just thought that'd be a funny way to end the segment.
7237920	7238920	It was.
7238920	7239920	It was funny.
7239920	7240920	Thanks, guys.
7241920	7242920	All right.
7249920	7252920	We've long since given up trying to find awesome endings to the show.
7252920	7255920	The end of Dungeons and Dragons is good enough.
7255920	7260920	I do want to have a special thanks for our guest comptroller, Bobcat Goldthwaite.
7263920	7265920	I'm the Bobcat.
7266920	7268920	And you just got scratched.
7270920	7273920	And thanks to all the people that we usually thank if you want the full list of credits
7273920	7276920	listed to another episode of the podcast, because Jeff usually has the whole list.
7276920	7277920	Oh, okay, yes.
7278920	7280920	We would like to thank Baby Jesus.
7281920	7284920	Thank you for the Mars Candy Corporation.
7284920	7285920	It's a great word.
7285920	7286920	Zach in the booth.
7286920	7290920	Dustin is usually here, but who's been replaced with a Zoom recorder this week,
7290920	7294920	which, you know, if the show turned out fine, he's in the crosshairs.
7297920	7298920	There's Danielle.
7298920	7299920	There's Mo.
7299920	7303920	There's other people running around doing all kinds of important things.
7303920	7306920	And just thank you to Meltdown for letting us be here every week.
7306920	7308920	And thank you for your patience.
7308920	7310920	And we'll see you next Sunday night.
7311920	7313920	God bless you.
7315920	7316920	That seems sincere.
7316920	7317920	Thank you, Spencer.
7320920	7321920	Thank you.
