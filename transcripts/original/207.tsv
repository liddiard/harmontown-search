0	15000	From the Hyatt Regency Hotel in beautiful Montreal, Quebec, Hormontown is now in session.
15000	21000	The three are Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
21000	24000	You know him.
24000	25000	You love him.
25000	28000	You want a piece of him, Spencer.
28000	34000	How are you doing, brother?
34000	36000	I'm so good.
36000	39000	How was that chicken sandwich at McDonald's sitting with you?
39000	41000	It was not so good.
41000	46000	Let's bring out the mayor of Hormontown, Dan Harmon!
53000	55000	Bonjour.
59000	62000	We're going to do the whole show in French.
68000	70000	Dipped in almost.
70000	71000	There we are.
71000	72000	Did you have a pill?
72000	73000	And I'm out.
73000	74000	That's it.
74000	75000	That's all I got.
75000	78000	That's two years of French in my high school days.
78000	81000	They make you take French, but you can also take Spanish.
81000	87000	You take each one for a year and you just kind of, I don't know if eight years is wheat
87000	91000	show.
91000	97000	If being bilingual makes you so great, then how come everyone bilingual isn't rich?
97000	101000	Why don't you have twice as much money if it's so important?
101000	104000	I guess Americans can't really have that philosophy anymore.
104000	106000	We're kind of broke now.
106000	109000	If you speak three languages, you're tri-lingual.
109000	111000	If you speak two languages, you're bilingual.
111000	114000	If you speak one language, you're American.
115000	119000	We may be back here in November forever.
121000	123000	I'm sure you've heard that a lot.
126000	128000	We'll be very low profile.
128000	131000	We're not going to act like we're allowed to be here.
131000	135000	We'll thank you for not building a wall before we get here.
135000	136000	We'll just hang out.
136000	141000	I will just enjoy sitting in a corner dipping French fries in mayonnaise without feeling creepy.
141000	143000	I love that so much.
143000	145000	Thank you for that cultural debate.
145000	148000	They just brought a bowl of mayonnaise with the French fries.
148000	152000	The French fries may as well be a spoon.
152000	155000	It's just yummy.
155000	158000	They put gravy on anything you want.
160000	163000	Some Montreal facts, Jeff.
163000	166000	Do you know the typewriter was invented here?
166000	172000	The shoe was invented here?
172000	175000	Just the one shoe.
175000	178000	It took another country to invent the other shoe.
178000	182000	Portugal invented the right shoe.
182000	189000	Did you guys know that for a long time, shoes existed before they figured out to make left and right versions of them?
189000	193000	They were just neutral shoes for a long time.
193000	195000	That makes sense, I guess.
195000	197000	Yeah, it's cool.
197000	199000	I love it.
199000	201000	Carry on.
201000	205000	What year did we start making feet-specific shoes?
205000	207000	Ancient history.
207000	210000	Maybe Egypt figured it out or something.
210000	211000	A long time ago.
211000	214000	How are you Spencer? I noticed you got more applause than I did.
214000	216000	Oh, yeah.
216000	217000	I don't know about that.
217000	218000	You know why?
218000	222000	Because you're as Canadian as an American can get.
222000	225000	I meant it as a compliment.
225000	227000	Yeah, you always mean it as a compliment.
227000	230000	I always take it as an insult.
230000	231000	Do I say it a lot?
231000	233000	Yeah, all the time.
233000	236000	You Canadian piece of shit.
236000	241000	Well, for instance, you missed your flight.
241000	243000	That's pretty Canadian.
243000	247000	Wasn't there just a flight all the time that anyone can just get on?
247000	249000	Mass transit.
249000	251000	You guys love mass transit.
251000	253000	So he missed his flight.
253000	255000	Because of mass transit.
255000	256000	Just connecting dots.
256000	258000	I just wanted to talk about you missing your flight.
258000	259000	No, I love it.
259000	261000	I didn't bring my passport.
261000	264000	I think that you used to not need a passport.
264000	265000	I don't know.
265000	266000	I didn't bring my passport.
266000	269000	That was back when people had the same shoe on both feet.
269000	276000	We invented countries and left and right shoes in 1928.
276000	282000	Al Capone invented the right shoe and the passport.
282000	284000	There's stuff flying off on my mustache.
284000	286000	I don't know if you can see that.
286000	289000	That means it's going to be a good show.
289000	291000	I'm a little sober.
291000	292000	I apologize.
292000	294000	But yeah, the bar is not open.
294000	297000	How do you have a hotel during a festival at 1 o'clock p.m.?
297000	298000	The barbie shut?
298000	299000	It's directly above us.
299000	301000	I think we hit the ceiling.
301000	302000	Can we get a really big broom?
302000	307000	We're making some drops of booze to trickle down the light fixtures.
307000	310000	Levi texted us all in a group text this morning telling us where to meet
310000	311000	and what the deal was.
311000	313000	And he said, the show is below the bar.
313000	315000	And Jeff said, I'll say.
322000	325000	Yeah, I've got some notes.
325000	327000	And then Spencer said, that's what she said.
327000	328000	And we're like, OK.
328000	330000	Hey, let's make this real clear.
330000	334000	Dustin on the text chain was doing That's What She Said all morning.
334000	337000	And by the time I was doing it, it was very clearly ironic.
337000	339000	OK.
339000	340000	All right.
340000	341000	That's what she said.
341000	343000	Then I wrote.
343000	346000	Then after 100 That's What She Saids, I wrote, I have a vagina
346000	348000	and like to have sex with men.
348000	350000	And nobody said anything.
350000	351000	Yeah.
351000	354000	It's plain hard to get.
354000	356000	That's proof that That's What She Said doesn't actually mean
356000	358000	that's what she said.
358000	359000	It means something else.
359000	361000	We don't know what it means.
361000	364000	We don't know who she is, why she keeps saying stuff.
364000	365000	But she's clearly.
365000	367000	She's pretty chatty.
367000	370000	She says a lot of stuff.
370000	371000	All right.
371000	373000	So let me just look at my.
373000	374000	You have a monitor, Dan.
374000	375000	Do you see yourself down here?
375000	378000	Oh, Jesus.
378000	383000	You can see the own stuff flying out of your own mustache.
383000	385000	I took off all my clothes in San Diego.
385000	387000	And I was looking at screen grabs of it.
387000	389000	And I was like, I got to get on the elliptical.
389000	394000	But then I just ate a quarter pounder with fromage downstairs.
394000	396000	Fries with mayonnaise.
396000	399000	I hate myself so much.
399000	402000	Just a disgusting monster.
402000	405000	Imagine being my girlfriend and just looking up.
405000	406000	How can I?
406000	411000	This giant gross flappy tits bouncing up and down.
411000	418000	And I like grit my teeth and go.
418000	423000	I made a TV show once.
423000	430000	I'm going to come thinking about my TV show.
430000	437000	Looking at my own tits.
437000	438000	She's a saint.
438000	440000	She's a good woman.
440000	443000	On the flight here, the gal I'm dating sent.
443000	447000	I left a little like little lovely post-it notes around the crib.
447000	450000	And she was texting Cody, Dan's girlfriend.
450000	454000	And she said, oh, look, she took a picture of one of the little post-it notes that I love you on the fridge.
454000	459000	And Cody goes, oh, Dan shit the bed.
459000	463000	OK, well, I was saving that for later.
463000	465000	It was only a matter of time.
465000	468000	You've heard me talk on the podcast about shitting my pants a lot.
469000	475000	What is a bed but a large pair of pants you wear for eight hours of your day?
475000	478000	And so, of course, it was a matter of time before I actually took sh...
478000	480000	You're wearing those giant pants a third of your life.
480000	482000	You're going to poop those pants as much.
482000	486000	I mean, so like I'm on this...
486000	490000	I know I don't look like it, but I'm on this Soylent diet back at home.
490000	493000	Like I'm just trying to...
493000	497000	And if I'm on the Soylent long enough, like for a couple of days,
497000	499000	like, you know, I'm just teeing it up.
499000	501000	Like, I don't want you to worry about me.
501000	505000	Like that I'm always shitting uncontrollably.
505000	508000	So just full disclosure.
508000	510000	I mean, I just have to tell you everything.
510000	512000	Because I was like, this is like, how did you...
512000	513000	What happened?
513000	517000	And I was like, I was masturbating.
517000	519000	And so I...
519000	521000	So you shit yourself.
521000	522000	I'm a...
522000	525000	I'm a kneeler.
525000	528000	So I had my laptop open in front of me and I was kneeling.
528000	530000	Can I pause for a second?
530000	532000	You don't have to applaud, but by applause.
532000	536000	Does anybody hear a kneeler when they masturbate?
536000	537000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
537000	538000	For real?
538000	540000	Really? It's not like a thing?
540000	541000	I don't think so.
541000	542000	Are you?
542000	544000	Is there a gal applauding tune next to you?
544000	545000	You're also...
545000	547000	I can't really see. Are you a gal? Yes.
547000	549000	You're a kneeler too?
549000	550000	You have.
550000	553000	You have knelt, but you're not a kneeler.
553000	554000	Like a kneeler.
554000	557000	Yeah, I've done all kinds of shit.
557000	561000	I put a pen on my ass, but I'm not an ass-penner.
561000	564000	I've done meth, but I'm not a method.
564000	567000	I'm just an adventurer.
567000	568000	I'm a tourist.
568000	570000	I'm a connoisseur of variety.
570000	573000	There's no other dedicated kneeler here? No?
573000	574000	But I really...
574000	575000	I'm actually surprised by that.
575000	576000	I've never bothered to ask.
576000	578000	Because like, for instance, watch this.
578000	581000	How many people here wipe their ass standing up?
581000	582000	Sometimes.
582000	583000	See?
583000	584000	I know it's embarrassing.
584000	587000	And you have to double that, because who's going to clap?
587000	590000	The brave and the single.
590000	592000	Oh, no, no, the other way around.
592000	594000	It's probably the people and couples.
594000	595000	But the...
595000	596000	I can't understand that at all.
596000	600000	But that's like a really specific thing that you would think is kind of weird.
600000	605000	And it's like 40% of the world wipes their ass standing up.
605000	607000	But no kneelers.
607000	609000	So there's something really weird about me.
609000	610000	I don't know what it is.
610000	613000	What percent of the world doesn't have squat toilets, though?
613000	615000	Does that line up?
615000	618000	Because in a squat toilet, you probably have to stand a white.
618000	620000	Oh, well, I don't know how that figures in.
620000	621000	I just look...
621000	623000	We could get someone on that.
623000	627000	I bet it's like 40% of the Western, like, sitting toilet world.
627000	628000	Oh, okay.
628000	629000	Well, fuck it.
629000	630000	But I'm just guessing.
630000	631000	Yeah, yeah.
631000	633000	We should have like a Hermon Town statistician.
633000	636000	Like somebody's up here and just pulling up stats for us.
636000	637000	Yeah.
637000	638000	That sounds like it.
638000	645000	So Montreal is the fourth largest country in the world.
645000	649000	And they have the 16th largest navy.
649000	655000	And each sailor gets their own typewriter.
655000	657000	Who's the current Prime Minister of Canada, Dan?
657000	661000	King Heraldo.
661000	663000	He just has one name.
663000	666000	And he's a very controversial figure.
666000	669000	He's run for four terms.
669000	672000	And he loves pickles.
672000	674000	And the metric system.
674000	676000	They make a king run for election?
676000	678000	Mm-hmm.
678000	679000	Yes.
679000	681000	And they call feet yards.
681000	682000	Here.
682000	684000	Did you know that?
684000	686000	Feet are yards.
686000	688000	These people.
688000	689000	You've got to love them.
689000	691000	Their trolleys don't have wheels.
691000	695000	They have sleds, little sleds on them.
695000	699000	If you say excuse me, that means fuck you.
699000	702000	Pants are napkins.
702000	708000	Glasses are an insult to your mother's family.
708000	714000	Which is your family as well.
714000	716000	Just on the matrilineal side.
716000	718000	Excuse me.
718000	719000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
719000	720000	Piece of shit.
720000	723000	Whoa.
723000	724000	All right.
724000	725000	So you're masturbating.
725000	726000	You're about to shake yourself.
726000	727000	Okay.
727000	728000	All right.
728000	730000	Let's stay on target here, Dan.
730000	733000	Well, maybe we should parcel this thing out.
733000	735000	This will be like Spalding Grey.
735000	738000	I'll take you up to a little point and then we'll talk about some other stuff.
738000	739000	Okay.
739000	741000	So here I am naked squatting on the...
741000	743000	I wonder what it is.
743000	744000	Maybe it's...
744000	745000	Who knows?
745000	746000	I don't know why I'm a kneeler.
746000	747000	I don't know.
747000	749000	I really thought there would be a couple kneelers in here.
749000	750000	Really.
750000	751000	Is there an origin story?
751000	755000	I can bring myself to orgasm easily enough.
755000	760000	Laying down or maybe sitting in the lotus position.
760000	761000	I don't know.
761000	765000	Are there any lotuses here?
765000	768000	I can finish in a variety of ways.
768000	772000	But when it comes to like, okay, I have work in 10 minutes.
772000	774000	The Uber's on its way.
774000	776000	I'm a kneeler.
776000	779000	Do you flex your legs when you're kneeling?
779000	782000	Or are you just trying to be as neutral as possible?
782000	786000	Are your legs doing anything or are they just propping you up to jerk off?
786000	791000	Because sometimes when I'm feeling good...
791000	794000	Sometimes when I'm feeling good, flexing.
794000	796000	Flexing those muscles helps.
796000	797000	It makes it feel different.
797000	798000	I sit on my heels.
798000	799000	Right.
799000	800000	Okay.
800000	804000	So you aren't shitting while you're upright.
804000	806000	You're kind of in just a modified sitting position.
806000	807000	Well, this isn't how I shit.
807000	811000	Just so to make it clear, this is how I shit once.
811000	813000	What I was doing when I shit once.
813000	817000	We're going to start the show in a couple minutes.
817000	821000	But I had the laptop open and I'm kneeling.
821000	824000	And I, again, with the Soylent.
824000	830000	And also I've recently discovered like, oh, a couple toots on a vape pen, you know?
830000	833000	Like makes masturbation more palatable.
833000	834000	Sure.
834000	835000	Palatable.
835000	836000	Yeah, it's tough.
836000	839000	I mean, you know, it makes it like...
839000	842000	It's less of a drag.
842000	848000	If you get high on marijuana, it's fun to jerk off.
848000	850000	Funner.
850000	856000	And so I took a little hit of a joint and I was kneeling and I...
856000	858000	This is last night?
858000	860000	No, this is when I...
860000	861000	Oh, two nights ago rather, yeah.
861000	866000	And I coughed.
866000	867000	I'll do it.
867000	868000	And then I didn't...
868000	869000	I didn't know.
869000	873000	I was like, eh, that was a hot one, but...
873000	875000	You know, and then I jerked off and then I...
875000	876000	But I didn't know.
876000	879000	And then I like, I guess I...
879000	881000	I fell asleep like this.
881000	884000	Oh, no.
884000	886000	Jesus Christ.
886000	887000	It's a blase energy.
887000	888000	But you just described...
888000	889000	You just showed us how you did it.
889000	890000	Didn't you poop on your feet?
890000	891000	Because you probably...
891000	892000	Yeah, no.
892000	894000	My feet aren't underneath my butt hole.
894000	895000	They were.
895000	900000	I'm not like the land of lakes girl.
900000	902000	I'm like, you know...
902000	903000	I got you.
903000	906000	I'm like a guy on a New York subway.
906000	910000	I'm a three-seater with my spread.
910000	914000	Okay, so you drift off to sleep.
914000	918000	And I get up and I got to go do something and I go, oh, boy.
918000	921000	I pooped in the bed.
921000	923000	I see it and I go, I don't have time to do anything about it.
923000	924000	Was Cody in the bed with you?
924000	925000	No!
925000	926000	She wasn't...
926000	927000	Why would I be kneeling and masturbating and farting?
927000	928000	I don't know.
928000	930000	I mean, maybe she came in later on and joined you in bed.
930000	931000	No.
931000	936000	See, that's the reason why this is all public knowledge now is because before we were supposed
936000	939000	to meet because we were going to...
939000	943000	She was going to spend the night and we had an early flight to come to Montreal.
943000	945000	Girl.
946000	947000	And so she...
947000	950000	I was at work and then Levi...
950000	953000	I had told Levi that I pooped in the bed.
953000	954000	Steve Levi.
954000	957000	That seems more like a Spencer task, isn't it?
957000	959000	It's nobody's task, but I said...
959000	961000	I wasn't telling him so he would clean it up.
961000	964000	Spencer, are you jealous that Steve Levi got the call?
964000	967000	I would have been real jealous, yeah.
968000	969000	I was just...
969000	972000	I was said to Levi, like, make sure...
972000	974000	I need to get home before Cody gets there.
974000	978000	I need to beat her home, like, because I have some things to tend to.
978000	980000	You just left it there for the day?
980000	982000	I had no choice.
982000	983000	I had to leave.
983000	985000	You fell in the laundry.
985000	987000	I didn't have time to do anything.
987000	989000	Did you just leave the poop on the bed?
989000	991000	Well, I did.
992000	993000	Cody just...
993000	994000	Cody's texting me.
994000	998000	She said, don't forget the reason you had to tell me was because of the new sheets.
998000	1000000	Yes, okay.
1001000	1006000	The sheets I pooped on were brand new sheets that Cody had found on Amazon
1006000	1011000	because I have a California King mattress, and so she found...
1011000	1014000	It's getting a little hot up here. I'm going to take off my sweatshirt.
1015000	1017000	Don't poop yourself.
1018000	1024000	I don't know why I'd be sweating up here, telling this story.
1026000	1027000	God damn it.
1028000	1030000	Such a fucking gross monster.
1030000	1034000	So I shit on the fucking new sheets that she...
1034000	1037000	So I knew, even if I...
1037000	1042000	I knew that if she got home before me, that she'd see that the new sheets came
1042000	1043000	and she'd be excited.
1043000	1046000	I knew she'd want to look at them, all of them, you know?
1046000	1049000	She'd, like, whip back the duvet and go, look at these new sheets.
1049000	1050000	You covered it up with the duvet?
1050000	1051000	I didn't cover it up.
1052000	1054000	Okay, I guess I maybe...
1054000	1055000	Jeez!
1055000	1056000	Oh, no.
1056000	1057000	You're a fucking villain.
1058000	1060000	I wasn't trying to hide it from anybody.
1060000	1063000	I have a dog sitter, so I didn't want her to have to look at shit.
1064000	1068000	She came in the room to get the dogs, and then she'd see...
1068000	1071000	I didn't want anyone to have to deal with my things, you know?
1071000	1074000	I don't want people to have to see things that would make them, you know,
1074000	1076000	have to never unsee them, you know?
1076000	1079000	Like, I don't want people to have to think about who I really am.
1079000	1081000	It's a burden on people.
1081000	1084000	It's like going to Vietnam, knowing me.
1084000	1086000	Like, knowing little things.
1086000	1089000	You could see things that would be the equivalent of, like,
1089000	1092000	seeing a beheading or something.
1095000	1097000	So, now you're...
1097000	1099000	So, she's texting me, and I go...
1101000	1102000	I just...
1102000	1105000	Let me see if I can find the conversation.
1105000	1107000	She was...
1109000	1111000	Steve comes running in, and he goes, like,
1111000	1113000	Cody's on her way to your house.
1113000	1115000	And she has a key.
1115000	1116000	I'm scrolling.
1116000	1119000	And he knows why that's dangerous.
1119000	1120000	Right.
1120000	1122000	This is, like, high noon all of a sudden.
1122000	1124000	We should have locked the gate.
1125000	1127000	She couldn't even use her house key that way.
1127000	1129000	I wasn't thinking when I left the house,
1129000	1131000	I'd have to keep Cody out of the house.
1131000	1134000	I was thinking I have to come home early and clean up my shit.
1134000	1136000	That's a good thought.
1139000	1141000	I'm just looking for this.
1141000	1142000	Sorry.
1144000	1146000	Let's all look up stuff on our phones.
1147000	1150000	Spencer, talk about the one-pen thing on airplanes.
1150000	1154000	This is a segment called Let's Uncork Spencer's Rage.
1154000	1155000	Yeah.
1156000	1159000	So, when you fly here, you've got to fill out a sheet.
1160000	1161000	I don't even know why.
1161000	1163000	I guess it's just so, like, they know if you're taking, like,
1163000	1165000	large amounts of money into the country
1165000	1167000	or, like, plants or something.
1167000	1168000	I don't know.
1168000	1169000	But you've got to fill out a sheet,
1169000	1172000	and then they don't have any pens on the plane,
1172000	1174000	because pens are very expensive.
1174000	1176000	We all know this.
1176000	1179000	How much money have you guys spent in pens in the last year?
1179000	1182000	Because for me, it's at least $1,000.
1182000	1185000	And I'm not even an airline.
1185000	1188000	And God knows, on an airplane, like,
1188000	1191000	space is at a premium, and pens are so bulky,
1191000	1195000	they're like a million hot towels worth of space
1195000	1198000	or shitty meals or fucking weird crackers
1198000	1201000	or all the other crap they jam into a plane.
1201000	1204000	And it's not like you can place them in a bag.
1204000	1205000	No.
1205000	1207000	They fall right out.
1207000	1209000	And they make a lousy promotional tool,
1209000	1211000	because you can't put your logo on them.
1211000	1212000	No.
1212000	1214000	And no one ever needs one,
1214000	1216000	and they never give one to anyone else.
1216000	1219000	And everyone's always traveling with writing utensils.
1219000	1222000	Anytime I go out of the door, I have writing utensils.
1222000	1224000	I got a colored pencil set.
1224000	1228000	Wallet, key, phone, ballpoint pen,
1228000	1230000	because I'm a form filler.
1230000	1232000	Yeah. That's what we do.
1232000	1235000	And also, just, you know, writing on paper is so today.
1235000	1237000	It's so useful.
1237000	1239000	Like, everyone's writing just stuff down
1239000	1242000	on pieces of paper these days.
1242000	1244000	You'd think that they'd have taken care of that
1244000	1246000	with, like, note-taking apps on phones
1246000	1248000	or, like, word processors on computers.
1248000	1250000	Anyway, they don't have any fucking pens.
1250000	1252000	They make you fill out a form.
1252000	1254000	But the thing is, there are pens on the plane,
1254000	1256000	but God help you if you get off the plane
1256000	1257000	without filling out that form,
1257000	1260000	because in the way to get out of the airport,
1260000	1262000	there's absolutely no one who will give you a pen.
1262000	1264000	And they'll tell you they're not allowed to give you a pen.
1264000	1266000	Or they did last time. I don't know.
1266000	1268000	This time, I borrowed from the guy next to me.
1268000	1273000	But then you're just trapped in another country
1273000	1276000	without, you know, cellular data service in most cases,
1276000	1279000	and you have to fill out a form
1279000	1281000	without any ability to fill out a form.
1281000	1283000	Like, there's literally nothing you can do.
1283000	1285000	You can't go to a store and buy a pen
1285000	1287000	because you're not on that side of the thing.
1287000	1289000	So you're just stuck in this legal limbo
1289000	1291000	where you have to fill out this form
1291000	1294000	that says I'm not carrying plants or $20,000.
1294000	1296000	How often does that come up?
1296000	1298000	Who gets that information?
1298000	1301000	How do they know if you're lying?
1301000	1303000	What if your address is off by a digit?
1303000	1305000	Like, who gives a shit?
1305000	1307000	If they're able to catch you in that,
1307000	1308000	then why don't they have the information?
1308000	1310000	Why would you have to fill out a form?
1310000	1311000	However they can...
1311000	1314000	Oh, so you live at 123 Hibiscus?
1314000	1317000	Sure, huh.
1317000	1320000	What are they catching with that process?
1320000	1321000	The guy asked me a million questions.
1321000	1323000	I don't fucking know where I'm going.
1323000	1325000	What are you doing in Montreal?
1325000	1326000	I'm here for the festival.
1326000	1327000	What?
1327000	1329000	The guy kept saying what every time.
1329000	1331000	If your job is to interrogate dumb, fat Americans
1331000	1332000	coming into your country,
1332000	1337000	learn to recognize mumbling.
1337000	1339000	I was like, I'm here for the Just For Laughs Festival.
1339000	1340000	What?
1340000	1342000	I was here for the Just For Laughs Festival.
1342000	1346000	Oh, do you have a letter?
1346000	1348000	A letter?
1348000	1351000	I haven't had a letter since 1989.
1351000	1353000	Who has a letter?
1353000	1355000	What am I, Paul Revere?
1355000	1357000	Do I have a letter?
1357000	1358000	Is this Game of Thrones?
1358000	1360000	What the fuck are you talking about?
1360000	1361000	Do you have a crow?
1361000	1366000	I sent it for a crow so I can enter your fucking house totally.
1366000	1367000	What the fuck?
1367000	1368000	What?
1368000	1371000	The Canadian customs people are much nicer than the U.S. customs people.
1371000	1372000	Well, in the U.S.
1372000	1373000	Yeah, but they're still customs people.
1373000	1374000	That's like saying like, oh.
1374000	1375000	More than once.
1375000	1378000	My turgid is like, there's more fiber in it.
1378000	1381000	Well, I think two times, Greg Proops, we travel to Canada a lot,
1381000	1386000	and Greg Proops, the comedian and friend of the show,
1386000	1389000	he twice, this is like, so what's your occupation?
1389000	1390000	He goes, I'm a comedian.
1390000	1391000	And he goes, no, you're not.
1391000	1394000	It's like you're an American.
1394000	1395000	I didn't say it was Canadian.
1395000	1396000	I said it was a comedian.
1396000	1397000	Twice that's happened.
1397000	1402000	Twice that's happened from the media.
1402000	1405000	Like you'd go up to customs and be like, I'm a Canadian.
1405000	1407000	Let me in.
1407000	1408000	For a living.
1408000	1410000	That's how I make my money.
1410000	1411000	Professional Canadian.
1411000	1412000	Do you have a letter?
1412000	1413000	What are you talking about?
1413000	1416000	And he says like, usually there's a letter.
1416000	1417000	An invitation to a thing.
1417000	1418000	And then they send you a letter.
1418000	1423000	I'm like, well, I guess that letter would get sent to a letter receiver.
1423000	1426000	I am a performer.
1426000	1428000	I am an artist.
1428000	1431000	He said, oh, like, well, are you traveling with a party?
1431000	1432000	I said, yes, I am.
1432000	1434000	And he said, so where are you going?
1434000	1437000	I said, your mom.
1437000	1438000	I said, a hotel.
1438000	1439000	Which one?
1439000	1441000	I don't know.
1441000	1443000	We had the exact same conversation.
1443000	1449000	I have left that brain space free for hilarious stories
1449000	1450000	about shitting in a bed.
1450000	1453000	Meanwhile, meanwhile, Seth Rogen was on our flight,
1453000	1455000	and that dude got shot out of there on a magic carpet.
1455000	1456000	He didn't do anything.
1456000	1458000	There was a good-looking middle-aged woman who picked him up
1458000	1462000	and just carried him out on a litter like Cleopatra.
1462000	1464000	And he just fucking, it was amazing.
1464000	1466000	Yeah, I was looking at Seth Rogen on the plane,
1466000	1468000	and I was thinking about that.
1468000	1472000	I'm like, does he have to fill out this fucking form and look for a pen?
1472000	1473000	I bet he doesn't.
1473000	1475000	I bet Alec Baldwin doesn't go to the DMV.
1475000	1477000	Or that's a driver thing.
1477000	1479000	I don't know what they call it here.
1479000	1483000	Le Carte Department of...
1483000	1486000	Le Fromage.
1486000	1488000	Vehicles.
1488000	1491000	V-E-C-O-L-O-M.
1491000	1494000	Why is he mocking our language?
1494000	1496000	Look at him.
1496000	1501000	Why is he entitled to leap across the border with no...
1501000	1502000	No letter.
1502000	1504000	With no letter.
1504000	1505000	I mean, I don't think I'm entitled.
1505000	1507000	You should lock me out if you want.
1507000	1509000	But I was calling the guys Bluff.
1509000	1511000	I'm thinking, let's see where this goes.
1511000	1513000	Am I going to go to Guantanamo?
1513000	1516000	I've been taking a secondary screening in Canada,
1516000	1519000	and I got everything but being duct-taped to a folding chair.
1519000	1522000	They sent me there and went through all my shit and gave me...
1522000	1525000	He did write a 94 on the bottom of my thing,
1525000	1529000	and I was like, I passed.
1529000	1532000	But then Cody's had a 63 or something.
1532000	1536000	I was like, wait, is this percentage chance you're a terrorist?
1536000	1538000	For the next people to check?
1538000	1539000	Because it's like a big 94.
1539000	1541000	I was actually really scared that they were going to go,
1541000	1543000	hmm, a 94, come with me.
1543000	1545000	And then, yeah, find out what Canadian waterboarding is.
1545000	1548000	Mine had a big X and a 35.
1548000	1550000	Because I was going through the thing where you type in,
1550000	1552000	you put the little four and they scan that in.
1552000	1553000	That's new for me.
1553000	1556000	You scan it in, and it's like, you didn't say date left Canada.
1556000	1558000	And I was like, haven't left Canada.
1558000	1560000	Yeah, that happened to me too.
1560000	1561000	And I was like, okay, I'll set a date.
1561000	1562000	I will leave Canada.
1562000	1563000	So I write that down.
1563000	1564000	And then it goes, sorry.
1564000	1565000	It shoots it back out.
1565000	1566000	It can read.
1566000	1569000	And it says, you didn't say how much money you're bringing in.
1569000	1570000	So I wrote zero.
1570000	1571000	And he goes, you didn't say how much money.
1571000	1573000	So I wrote a bunch of zeros in there.
1573000	1574000	And it lines through them all.
1574000	1576000	And then it goes, how many plants do you have?
1576000	1578000	And I said, I just wrote zero.
1578000	1581000	And he goes, all right, we're going to have to ask you a lot more questions.
1581000	1585000	Why do you have zero plants?
1585000	1586000	Those machines are new.
1586000	1588000	You're supposed to bring a gift.
1588000	1591000	You're going to see the Lannisters, for God's sake.
1591000	1593000	You're empty-handed?
1594000	1596000	Where is your poppy milk?
1596000	1597000	Milk of the poppy.
1597000	1600000	I've brought the letter a million times to Canada where you get this letter of invitation
1600000	1604000	that says where you're performing, what kind of theater, what the deal is, who you're with,
1604000	1605000	all this stuff.
1605000	1606000	And they never read it.
1606000	1607000	They just look at it.
1607000	1608000	You show them the letter and they go, okay, he has the letter.
1608000	1610000	And it's a cursory glance of the thing.
1610000	1612000	You can just hand them like a...
1612000	1616000	Yeah, and of course, ISIS could never get a hold of a just for laughs letter.
1616000	1619000	It's just not within their fucking capability.
1619000	1622000	They've got so many other things to think about.
1622000	1626000	Yeah, we got ISIS to think about.
1626000	1632000	I remember that there was a guy in America that was a mailman that landed on the lawn
1632000	1635000	with letters for Congress to talk about campaign reform.
1635000	1640000	It was like a kind of performance art slash protest slash possible martyrdom
1640000	1643000	because he knew there was a chance they might shoot him out of the sky.
1643000	1645000	It's like he made his own helicopter, right?
1645000	1648000	Yeah, it was like a little lawn chair with a helicopter blade on it.
1648000	1651000	He just landed right next to the fucking Congress.
1651000	1652000	And they took him to jail.
1652000	1653000	They should hire that guy.
1653000	1654000	He makes his own helicopters.
1654000	1656000	And it was like, okay, great.
1656000	1658000	This is like, okay, campaign reform.
1658000	1659000	Now we're going to talk about it a little bit.
1659000	1662000	And like five minutes later, the top story on CNN was,
1662000	1666000	how many ISIS could have fit on that helicopter?
1666000	1671000	What if that was an ISIS?
1671000	1672000	They think they're so important.
1672000	1673000	People want to kill them.
1673000	1678000	These lawmakers, oh, they're going to come in here and ISIS us.
1679000	1683000	Then the country will shut down because there's not a bunch of fucking jerks
1683000	1686000	banging gavels and whatever they do in there.
1686000	1687000	All right.
1687000	1688000	Hate government.
1688000	1689000	Stupid.
1689000	1696000	Did you know that Montreal's government is divided into four quadrants?
1696000	1704000	The press, the judicial, the police, and mass transit.
1704000	1706000	And they all check the balances.
1706000	1709000	The way a bill becomes a law, they don't call it a law here.
1709000	1712000	They call it a lure.
1712000	1717000	Is that you have to, a judicial has to have an idea.
1717000	1721000	And then he gives it to a bus driver.
1721000	1725000	If a majority of the bus drivers think that it's an okay idea,
1725000	1730000	then they pass that up to the police who don't carry guns
1730000	1732000	and who simply say thank you.
1732000	1734000	And then the bus drivers say sorry.
1734000	1736000	And then they say thank you.
1736000	1737000	Sorry.
1737000	1739000	And then after a while it's a law.
1739000	1741000	But you can break it too.
1741000	1744000	And they'll just make you a policeman.
1744000	1746000	It's a perfect system.
1746000	1748000	You know how many people died here last year?
1748000	1749000	Zero.
1749000	1750000	What?
1750000	1751000	Yeah, it's like Brigadoon.
1751000	1753000	I assume.
1753000	1754000	Never read it.
1754000	1755000	Have you seen Brigadoon?
1755000	1756000	No.
1758000	1761000	It's like Westworld but with no guests.
1761000	1762000	But they're not robots.
1762000	1764000	They just don't die.
1767000	1770000	You know, last time there was a mass shooting in Canada.
1770000	1775000	It was a paintball game.
1777000	1780000	They try not to shoot each other when they play paintball up here.
1780000	1781000	There was an American.
1781000	1782000	He went nuts.
1782000	1784000	He shot everybody.
1784000	1788000	And their flags were at quarter mass.
1788000	1794000	Six decons, which is what they call a month here.
1794000	1796000	Do they have a metric calendar here?
1796000	1797000	Ten months make a year.
1797000	1798000	Isn't that simpler?
1798000	1800000	Each month is ten days.
1800000	1801000	Makes sense.
1801000	1803000	How many days in a year?
1803000	1804000	A hundred.
1805000	1807000	I was about to say a thousand.
1809000	1811000	It's a simple system.
1812000	1813000	Okay.
1813000	1819000	Spencer, can you come share a mic so you can read Cody's lines in this text conversation?
1819000	1820000	Yeah.
1820000	1821000	So I come up there.
1821000	1822000	I'll use your mic.
1822000	1823000	Okay.
1823000	1824000	Great.
1824000	1825000	Yeah.
1825000	1826000	Okay.
1826000	1832000	So Thursday, 903 p.m., you're gray so you're Cody.
1832000	1833000	Okay.
1833000	1835000	I might get to your house a little early if that's okay.
1835000	1838000	So Nicole can drive me and I don't have to Uber.
1838000	1840000	Are you on your way?
1841000	1842000	Not yet.
1842000	1845000	Nicole was going to drive me in about five to ten mins.
1845000	1849000	But I can change that plan if needed.
1849000	1852000	It's okay.
1852000	1859000	But it necessitates me warning you about one thing.
1859000	1863000	It's not sex doll related.
1863000	1864000	Ha.
1864000	1865000	Okay.
1865000	1866000	I can wait if it makes you uncomfortable.
1866000	1867000	That's great.
1867000	1868000	That's awesome.
1868000	1870000	I can just Uber when you're ready.
1870000	1872000	It's no big deal.
1872000	1876000	I guess I'd rather just tell you now because otherwise you'll have to make up guesses in
1876000	1877000	your head.
1877000	1879000	That was a bad move, Dan.
1879000	1880000	It was not.
1880000	1881000	She just went with it.
1881000	1882000	That's true.
1882000	1887000	The new sheets came.
1887000	1891000	And Sophia put them on the bed on Tuesday.
1891000	1895000	And they're great.
1895000	1898000	Asterisk.
1898000	1903000	And then last night I accidentally kind of shit on them.
1903000	1906000	Ha ha ha.
1906000	1908000	Oh.
1908000	1910000	My.
1910000	1913000	And I didn't see until this morning.
1913000	1915000	God.
1915000	1918000	There's a visible stain.
1918000	1920000	So what's our plan for sleeping tonight?
1920000	1922000	Are the old sheets still somewhere?
1922000	1924000	By the way, I'm not judging you, baby.
1924000	1926000	Just trying to solve a problem solve for later.
1926000	1928000	That's also great.
1928000	1930000	Well, it's not.
1930000	1932000	I just need to hit it with some cleaner.
1932000	1933000	You never had to know.
1933000	1938000	But now I had to tell you because you getting there before me and you were going to see
1938000	1942000	this new sheets and want to look at them and then you were going to see the stain.
1942000	1943000	Ha ha ha.
1943000	1944000	Okay.
1944000	1948000	Well, I don't think I'm going to get there before you anyway now because I released Nicole
1948000	1950000	when you said you had to tell me something.
1950000	1952000	So I'll just meet you there at seven.
1952000	1954000	Ergo.
1955000	1956000	Erg.
1956000	1958000	It auto corrected.
1958000	1959000	Sorry.
1959000	1961000	I didn't know what was going to be.
1961000	1964000	And I didn't want her to keep you and I didn't want to keep her waiting.
1964000	1966000	So I just told her to go on.
1966000	1967000	Well, now you know.
1967000	1970000	I shit on the new sheets you picked out.
1970000	1971000	Ha ha.
1971000	1972000	I don't care.
1972000	1973000	I didn't pay for them.
1973000	1974000	You can order a million more.
1974000	1978000	I was just making sure we had a plan tonight because I know you're because you know, I'm
1978000	1983000	sort of OCD about germs trying to get over it, but I'm still not cured.
1984000	1989000	Well, yeah, I just was scanning ahead because I didn't want to invade her privacy.
1989000	1990000	Yeah.
1990000	1991000	I just thought of that.
1991000	1992000	Yeah.
1994000	1995000	Okay.
1995000	1997000	I just thought of that.
1997000	1998000	No, I have a question.
1998000	2002000	Good thing she's not OCD about privacy.
2002000	2005000	By the way, did you already head back to the house?
2005000	2007000	Because I was going to say if it's easier.
2007000	2008000	Oh, that's her.
2008000	2009000	Sorry.
2009000	2010000	That's what you skipped away a lot.
2010000	2012000	Well, I think I can skip ahead.
2013000	2014000	Uh.
2015000	2016000	Let's see.
2016000	2017000	I was.
2017000	2018000	Oh.
2018000	2019000	Oh, by the way.
2019000	2020000	Okay.
2020000	2021000	You read that part.
2021000	2022000	Sorry.
2022000	2023000	I'm really fucking this up.
2023000	2024000	Okay.
2024000	2025000	By the way, did you already head back to the house?
2025000	2027000	Because I was going to say if it's easier for me to meet you in B bank, I could just
2027000	2028000	do that.
2028000	2030000	And my social security number.
2032000	2035000	Oh, well, yeah, I'm almost home.
2035000	2040000	I was only going home to, you know, clean the shit stain.
2041000	2042000	Ah.
2042000	2043000	Potato.
2043000	2044000	Is that like a curse word?
2044000	2045000	No, that's okay.
2045000	2046000	Pet name.
2046000	2047000	All right.
2047000	2048000	Well, I tried.
2048000	2050000	Well, you can still do that now.
2050000	2056000	And I know so you can get extra points that would have otherwise just gone unnoticed.
2056000	2060000	I don't think that's how cleaning up your own shit works.
2060000	2063000	I think it's better when nobody knows.
2064000	2067000	By the way, does Levy know about this whole thing?
2067000	2071000	Because it would make our text exchange a lot funnier if I knew he was covering for
2071000	2072000	you.
2072000	2073000	Because he was like being super big.
2073000	2074000	Right.
2074000	2075000	That's good, though.
2075000	2076000	It depends on when you talked.
2076000	2078000	We can compare time stamps and figure it out.
2078000	2079000	I don't know.
2079000	2080000	Okay.
2080000	2081000	Yeah.
2081000	2082000	I don't know.
2082000	2083000	This is all fine.
2083000	2084000	Yeah.
2084000	2085000	I mean, well.
2085000	2087000	I mean, it looks like it transitions out of this conversation.
2087000	2088000	Yeah.
2088000	2089000	Great.
2089000	2090000	Okay.
2090000	2091000	Great.
2091000	2092000	Thank you, Spencer.
2092000	2095640	Had we planned that, we could have ended on a big thing like a lion coming out in the
2096640	2097640	text or something.
2097640	2098640	Potato.
2098640	2100640	I have a couple of questions.
2100640	2101640	I'm a potato.
2101640	2102640	She's a bean.
2102640	2103640	Potato and bean.
2103640	2104640	Yeah.
2104640	2112640	Because I'm like a, like a potato is like a giant bean, kind of, but that lives in dirt.
2112640	2113640	So do beans, don't they?
2113640	2114640	Okay.
2114640	2117640	A bean grows on a plant in the sunlight and it heals people.
2117640	2119640	It's good for you.
2119640	2122640	Potato is just a fucking gross piece of shit.
2122640	2133040	Giant subterranean, obese bean covered in filth and warts waiting to be dug up and turned
2133040	2138760	into something better by anyone.
2138760	2143720	Possibly with a knife.
2143720	2148640	Begging to be cut, stabbed, microwaved.
2148640	2151460	Catching potatoes and Seth Rogan.
2151460	2152800	What about this sausage party?
2152800	2153800	Have you seen this?
2153800	2154800	Have you heard about this?
2154800	2155800	I've seen the adage.
2155800	2158120	The foods, they're alive.
2158120	2161640	They got feelings and personalities.
2161640	2162640	But here's the thing.
2162640	2163880	I mean, Toy Story, you get it?
2163880	2166900	It's like, these are things they're made for children to enjoy.
2166900	2169640	And part of the love of the child brings the toys to life.
2169640	2170640	I get it.
2170640	2175600	But you have, like, lettuce that's like alive and a potato that's alive and hotdogs that
2175600	2178040	are alive and bacon that's alive.
2178040	2179040	But when does that happen?
2179040	2182560	I mean, the lettuce is obviously always alive or whatever.
2182560	2186920	When does the bacon stop being a pig and become an alive piece of bacon?
2186920	2188960	And is it before it's sliced into bacon?
2188960	2189960	Does it know it was sliced into bacon?
2189960	2194960	And a hot dog is a conglomeration of a bunch of different meats and ingredients.
2194960	2195960	Yeah.
2195960	2197960	At what point does that become sentient?
2197960	2201880	Why isn't the herbs and spices in the hot dog, like, are they dead or are they...
2201880	2202880	Yeah.
2202880	2203880	There's a hot dog bun.
2203880	2207040	Is the wheat sentient or is the dough sentient and does it know it's getting put into an
2207040	2208680	oven?
2208680	2210400	I think it's like a rated R comedy.
2210400	2212600	I'm sure they just make fun of that thing and then they...
2212600	2217360	If they don't explore that premise and come up with a reason, I'm gonna be so pissed because
2217360	2218360	they could.
2218360	2219440	And it would probably be awesome.
2219440	2221720	But I bet they'll just say, oh, that's just part of the conceit.
2221720	2222720	You gotta accept it.
2222720	2223720	And I will not.
2223720	2224720	Shots fired, sausage party.
2224720	2225720	But it's probably gonna be great.
2225720	2226720	I'm sure.
2226720	2227720	I mean, I...
2227720	2228720	I saw the one...
2228720	2229720	I don't care for the ad campaign.
2229720	2230720	I saw one.
2230720	2240920	There was a female taco and she's got, like, little, like, sexy legs and I got like a hand
2240920	2243640	on her hip, on her taco shell hip.
2243640	2247480	And it says she likes fish and beef or, you know, like...
2247480	2248480	Beef and fish, I think.
2248480	2249480	Yeah.
2249480	2250480	She said she's a bisexual taco.
2250480	2251760	I'm great.
2251760	2252760	But she's...
2252760	2254120	The fish part is like...
2254120	2256080	It's like they call it a fish taco, right?
2256080	2258240	Like, so it's like she's eating out herself?
2258240	2259240	Kind of?
2259240	2260240	Yeah.
2260760	2261760	Yeah.
2261760	2262760	Maybe that's just me.
2262760	2263760	I don't know.
2263760	2264760	I don't like it.
2264760	2265760	Ain't gonna see it.
2265760	2266760	Maybe you guys should go see it.
2266760	2267760	You know?
2267760	2268760	Oh, I'll see it.
2268760	2269760	It'll be great.
2269760	2270760	Dan, why did we...
2270760	2271760	Did we discuss why Cody hates Seth Rogen so much?
2271760	2273760	Why does her fucking problem with Seth Rogen?
2273760	2274960	Stop that.
2274960	2277680	No one hates Seth Rogen.
2277680	2281040	He's worth billions of dollars.
2281040	2282040	Why didn't we get him on the podcast?
2282040	2283040	Oh yeah, you were...
2283040	2284040	We were...
2284040	2287240	Because I'm not gonna be some weird douche on a plane that goes like, hey, can you come
2287240	2288240	and fuck it?
2288240	2291160	Seth Rogen sits there and he goes, this is Dan Harmon sitting over there, and this guy's
2291160	2292160	not even gonna look at me?
2292160	2293760	He's not even gonna ask me to come be on Harmontown?
2293760	2294760	No.
2294760	2297520	Well, I think he'd be truly grateful that I didn't bug him.
2297520	2299800	Maybe he didn't just get whisked out of the airport.
2299800	2304240	Maybe he ran because he was sort of ashamed.
2304240	2305960	He probably has a lot of stuff going on, I think.
2305960	2306960	What do you have to do?
2306960	2310440	At what point is your career so awesome that you get Seth Rogen airport status?
2310440	2311760	You have to be Seth Rogen.
2311760	2312760	He's worth like a...
2312760	2313760	He gives a jillion dollars.
2313760	2314760	Yeah.
2314760	2315760	Of course he is.
2315760	2317840	What's the low end of that thing?
2318440	2319440	What's the threshold you have?
2319440	2320440	Oh, yeah.
2320440	2321440	I don't know.
2321440	2322440	It's probably like DL Hughley or something.
2322440	2323440	Yeah, yeah.
2323440	2324440	That's what I was gonna say.
2324440	2327600	I think probably there's like a threshold you cross right around Hughley level.
2327600	2328600	Yeah.
2328600	2329600	Yeah.
2329600	2333360	Where like maybe like an old person comes and meets you at the gate and kind of takes
2333360	2336120	you to like a slightly shorter taxi line.
2336120	2341280	Did I ever tell Harmontown how I was on the plane with George Takei, Sulu from Star Trek?
2341280	2342280	Yeah.
2342280	2343280	Yeah.
2343280	2344280	Yeah.
2344280	2345280	Oh my.
2345280	2346280	Yeah.
2346280	2349160	What do you do in your life when you got Sulu on the plane?
2349160	2353360	I had to stop following him on Twitter because he just he has like a little cottage industry
2353360	2357160	of like retweeting stuff and then you click and it's all bad jokes too.
2357160	2358360	It's not great.
2358360	2363360	An ad supported like shit fills your screen and like oh my.
2363360	2366880	Isn't he mad about the gay Sulu?
2366880	2368840	Like the openly gay Sulu in that movie?
2368840	2370280	Wasn't he like mad about it?
2370280	2371760	But I don't know even what you're talking about.
2371760	2374000	Oh, there's a new Star Trek movie.
2374000	2375480	There's a new Sulu.
2375480	2376480	He's openly gay.
2376480	2377480	Oh.
2377480	2378480	In the character.
2378480	2379480	And he doesn't like it.
2379480	2380600	I don't think George Takei likes it.
2380600	2383840	I guess I could understand that because he'd be going well I'm an actor.
2383840	2389480	I played a character like why are you making him gay just like a nod to my sexuality as
2389480	2390480	a real person?
2390480	2391480	Yeah.
2391480	2394400	I guess I kind of get that but on the other hand I can understand them thinking he's going
2394400	2398920	to be stoked about this because he had to be in the closet back then while he was like
2398920	2402160	a huge star and that was like probably really unfair and painful.
2402160	2406360	So in their minds they were probably like this is sort of a little bit of a restitution.
2406360	2410060	It's like a doffing of the cap, an apology almost.
2410060	2413440	So I can understand how there's two heroes in that story and they're both each other's
2413440	2414440	villains isn't it?
2414440	2415440	Yeah.
2415440	2416440	Isn't that something?
2416440	2417440	Well that's just the world man.
2417440	2418440	That's the world we live in.
2418440	2421120	What if dichotomy was too limited for the human experience?
2421120	2426560	What if everything happened in a continuum that ate itself you know like what if you
2426560	2432520	shouldn't have to choose between I heard a guy on public radio some Democrat guy that
2432520	2438680	was like pumping people up for Hillary Clinton and he was like in between applause swells
2438680	2444160	he was like I don't know who it was because it was radio I couldn't see him but he was
2444160	2454640	like now I know our candidate isn't perfect but what did he say he's like but it's about
2454640	2459440	not voting for Trump basically is what he said it was like that's the fucking scam in
2459440	2463760	a nutshell it's like it just it's just fucking sucks like and it's really not limited to
2463760	2470800	America it's just like magnified there where it's like we it's just scam that we've turned
2470800	2476220	elections into how much you hate someone else and so that's just an easy way to get nothing
2476220	2480480	done because everyone's like oh don't vote for that other person there's always someone
2480480	2485200	worse to vote for in fact there's only one person that's worse or better to vote for and
2485200	2491040	it's like you have to choose but it's a dumb crap fucking what I smashed my brains in with a hammer
2491040	2496280	I had to I can only threaten suicide now verbally because it's not probably not legal to say you
2496280	2500920	want to kill someone else you know be taken seriously because there's a lot of people that
2500920	2506320	deserve to die it wouldn't it wouldn't be taken as a joke because it'd be like I could that's a
2506320	2509960	threat because I would want to kill that person too but you're not allowed to say it for that
2509960	2518720	reason I just want to kill so many people I mean are there people like I would imagine a lot of
2518720	2525840	you like you like you're Justin Trudeau right like you people like him yeah he's so charming
2525840	2534840	and so like open-minded and sexy and like like kind of and he created Dunesbury okay so he's
2534840	2539240	very political we know that going in like he knows about the issues because he made a political
2539240	2545840	cartoon for many decades is it possible to still be a government-hating anarchist when you're when
2545840	2551400	your prime minister is that charming and sexy good that's what I want to hear probably all the
2551400	2555040	more so because there's probably an effective level of like lower level government here that's
2555040	2559120	probably very you know whether whether or not it's better than most or not but it's probably
2559120	2564440	maybe maybe the issues they have to deal with here are less like there's a lunatic in the White House
2564440	2570400	he's gonna kill us all like and more just like yeah but this is bullshit and inefficient and it
2570400	2574200	kind of cheats these people out of this or that and so it's probably you could probably still hate
2574200	2581920	the government even if you have a good good prime minister yeah good this is hate government not the
2581920	2585960	government you can just hate government who wants to be governed why would they have invented
2585960	2590400	government if anyone liked being governed no one's gonna ask for it to happen they had to make it up
2590400	2595200	like you need to be governed well oh good it's a good thing you told me because I never would have
2595200	2600240	fucking come up with that idea on my own someone telling me what to do it's not something I'd come
2600240	2608240	up with I'd rather hang out and then I poop and I'm like who's gonna move that somewhere where it
2608240	2614160	stinks less we need to someone govern someone and get that out of here I think he'll govern me I
2614160	2620880	think King Geraldo's doing a pretty bang-up job though he found Al Capone's vault I mean there was
2620880	2629160	nothing in it but well I've run out of lack of materials there I never had any but whatever I
2629160	2635640	didn't have I've run out of is there an epilogue to the sheets like you you got I got home and I
2636120	2644840	found some pet spray like some for carpets I try it you know I there's somebody who poops
2644840	2650080	himself as often as you you should really have some stain stuff right yeah some nature's miracle
2650080	2656880	yeah so I yeah and they got the old sheets back out and yeah I did the new sheets come out of the
2656880	2661560	laundry I didn't poop on them no I didn't know I'm saying that the new ones did they come out
2661560	2667320	alright or do we know oh I don't know they teed up for the laundry so they're just right now at
2667320	2672960	home just chilling in the laundry basket they're not covered in shit there it's not like it's not
2672960	2677520	like the Manson murders like like but with but everything's brown instead of red like I didn't
2677520	2684360	I didn't it's not like it's it's not it's a little skidmark okay it's like a little you know I just I
2684640	2693880	coughed I coughed and I had been drinking soylent a lot is my girlfriend still out there is she did
2693880	2700640	she just leave she's just like she's back in Los Angeles yeah she did she did leave hmm I just I
2700640	2707960	go back I go to the back of the room and there's just a note a letter with just for laughs letter
2707960	2713680	head that I can use to get back into America I don't know why I keep looking at this back though
2713680	2722360	right like usually there's just a bunch of ATM style machines right when you're coming back I can't
2722360	2726680	remember now I've only dealt with these big ATM like that's the American way it's like don't use
2726680	2735080	like free paper and pens that you borrow from people buy eighteen ten thousand dollar machines
2735080	2740440	and just put them in a row and let them sort it out like yeah every three months they'll become
2740440	2744240	obsolete and you'll have no bid contract with whoever makes those machines it's like American
2744240	2753440	job creation man yeah let that shit trickle down to Quebec fucking global hegemony if you guys are
2753440	2758840	so smart why aren't you rich what do you have missiles what are your top fat smart have a big
2758880	2767760	missile what are your top four favorite provinces in Canada and I mean we're gonna I'm gonna
2767760	2776160	eliminate Quebec cuz we're in Quebec so we're limited I think you know in my heart I'm a I'm
2776160	2785920	a sesquipaduche man like you gotta catch them all yeah but you know everybody always says
2786440	2796440	Ademata Pia but but but I think and that's that's two and I got nailed it and I and you know I'll
2796440	2804600	give you Saskatchewan and Ottawa the and those are and north north of that is Peabody and helms
2804600	2813280	helmsman Wichita I don't know man it's a it's a big thing it's above it's on all of our maps
2813280	2819800	it's just like a big square above the world and then it's subdivided into squares and they all
2819800	2827120	have these names like scooby doo-ba-doo Canada's always pink on the maps don't let them panic you
2827120	2831240	it's not always pink on the maps I know it's a weird arbitrary thing for him to say it's it's
2831240	2834400	usually white it's usually like because it's like oh it's the North Pole there's penguins
2834400	2840600	up there there's bacons and penguins and and and and no one that can invade us and that's what's
2840600	2846960	important just the penguins are on the bottom of earth you guys don't have any oil or fresh

2880360	2887400	millionths to blame if it's is it the subprime mortgage thing is that that thing did we okay

3035320	3040440	so you uh you transited in from uh from Ottawa to be here for the festival yes just for the show
3040440	3045960	yeah just for us yeah wow that's uh are we living up to your standards of course and here you are
3045960	3053720	on stage fantastic yes uh what's what's going on that has made you blue JP uh in March my girlfriend
3053720	3060760	passed away oh here there you go that's it for those of you listening in audio they laughed
3060760	3066120	because I handed him a drink he didn't give him a hug that would be that's gonna be the weirdest
3066120	3070360	reaction he should have been my girlfriend passed away oh
3070360	3079320	ah I'm so how long ago did this happen is like a hug yes how did uh how long ago I'm sorry I didn't
3079320	3087080	get uh in March okay and then we asked her what caused uh pulmonary embolism caused by
3087080	3091800	antibiotic fluid oh Jesus so it was it was no warning at all like it was pregnant oh
3092200	3094840	oh all right good night folks
3096920	3104840	just for tears festival holy smoke yeah how old was she uh 32 and so that just came out of the
3104840	3110600	out of nowhere so your your has put together about this and able to share this without without a
3110600	3115160	crack in the veneer because it's just it's absolutely necessary you had to deal with it
3115160	3122600	and you're just you're a brick wall right now try my best no and so what happens after that
3122600	3127720	happens like like in terms of like do you do you keep to yourself if everyone's like flooding you
3127720	3132360	with emails and phone calls and things do you want to be alone uh it's more or less I think
3132360	3139160	what happens is that immediately afterwards you get like sort of uh it's like a tsunami it just
3139160	3144440	hits you you have like no repair like you have no idea what's going on you're constantly surrounded
3144440	3149400	by people and then after one point like everybody's gone like you have your family you have your
3149400	3153160	close friends but then you sort of realize sort of the extent of the damage
3156760	3160680	meaning that that you say you the tsunami is referring to a bunch of people flooding you with
3160680	3165560	with condolences and the condolences and also the fact like she passed away like it comes out
3165560	3171080	of nowhere like it sort of just hits you so and it's probably I would imagine it's probably timed
3171080	3180040	right so that just when you might actually need some like sympathy it's probably
3180760	3185480	timed it's just after everyone is kind of like okay I did my part yeah pretty much that's pretty
3185480	3190840	much that's what you awaken to this tragedy after your body has protected you through numbness and
3190840	3197720	stuff and you you you regain sensitivity and then you're largely alone and as you said you're
3197720	3205400	surveying the the damage like what is give us give us a detail not about the the not about the
3205400	3214760	event I think it's too too ghoulish to but about the loss about after afterward like like like
3214760	3220280	I don't know paperwork or like like like like what is when you're married and then you lose
3221080	3229080	your partner like what is the what is the worst like like non-emotional inconvenience
3231800	3236440	I think pretty much the paperwork it's you have so much paperwork to fill up it's amazing
3236440	3242920	the insurance the for the hospital and everything everything you have to deal with it's like it's a
3242920	3247560	non-stop barrage of paperwork and I snap a few times that people on the phone want to have to
3247560	3250440	fill up and they're like oh yeah the doctor needs to fill desktop and I just call them up
3250440	3256440	and like motherfucker like just leave me be for just five minutes alone and yeah yeah that was
3256440	3262520	just about to ask that before you said it like you must several times a day or a week like you must
3262520	3267400	just explode into a righteous outrage because you're talking to someone that's just like
3268360	3274920	oh you have to fill out a z stroke nine dash two and like they they're not even you have to remind
3274920	3282680	them why this is happening and what's going on oh yeah oh yeah I like a few times you have to
3282680	3286280	call like for example like I don't know like her phone company and then tell they're like tell
3286280	3290600	them like we have to cancel her her contract and they're like oh what's the reason it's like well
3290600	3297160	she passed away and like you just hear their enthusiasm just drop sort of like in the room
3297160	3302200	when when I announced what happened like the same thing like well it's and I sort of feel bad that
3302200	3307080	like you invite somebody oh here's not feeling well enthusiasm dropping is a negative way of
3307080	3312680	putting it I think that's it's them like like opening up to you know they're like oh I need to
3312680	3318920	be I need to be on alert I'm not gonna trample all around this I'm gonna like like be careful now
3318920	3324600	and like how long did you know her like 10 years and you're married for how long oh we were not
3324600	3331480	married oh you're sorry no it was like a common law couple pardon common law uh wow did you have any
3333080	3339400	do you have any moments when you do one of those snaps where you like shut somebody down or just
3339400	3345000	like go into a sam jackson monologue do you do you do you do you have any memories of any like
3345000	3350760	choice zingers that you literally you just dropped a bomb on somebody on the phone it happened a few
3350760	3357400	times yes do you remember like your favorite your favorite one it's mostly like people when they
3357400	3363640	talk about in the um yeah trying to recall but it's it's such a blur right now but it's mostly like
3366200	3372280	how long ago did you say it happened I'm sorry uh march 7th wow um just like what like are you
3372280	3377560	just numb do you walk around in kind of a daze or are you have you kind of has since come back to
3377560	3382040	you at all more or less yes yeah yeah like today I was just walking around for a few hours before
3382040	3387880	the show and like you do feel like sometimes you snap back you snap out and you just relive the
3387880	3392360	moment again and again and again do you have like a friend or a family member or do you have like any
3392360	3397240	circle of people that are like like there's been like someone to totally rely on and oh yes oh good
3397240	3402760	that's yeah no no for the first month my best friend lived with me so uh he was very kind and
3403960	3409080	uh I thanked him for doing that and I thanked his wife to allow him to spend some time with me and
3409160	3416040	she was like super happy you can have him oh yeah she was like oh you can keep it from as long as
3416040	3420040	as long as he was like are you sure I'm getting so much shit down at the house right now it's amazing
3420040	3424120	exactly that's what she kept saying I get stuff done finally because he's the fuck out of that
3425480	3430760	how many people this year or within it within a year or so how many how many people out here
3430760	3438120	have lost a loved one there was like a big you made you made people clap for that by the way
3439400	3445720	well let's hear it everybody put those hands together for lost loved ones well they came to
3445720	3450840	a comedy show they were they they're probably looking forward to a little levity um that that
3450840	3458760	was less less applause than I thought I'd hear like I uh but so it must be like lonely like not
3458760	3462760	even in the sense that you lost a loved one but it's a lonely experience like there's not a bunch
3462760	3466200	of people around you that understand what's happening to you and there was no time to even
3466520	3470600	prepare yourself for it it just happened no so it's just the rug's completely pulled out from
3470600	3475480	under you exactly yeah like I mean I my mother passed away and like we knew like like she it
3475480	3481160	was a process and you emotionally you know kind of get ready for that but I can't imagine if just
3481160	3488360	somebody went poof like that it's it's horrifying what's a thing that you uh put yourself into that
3488360	3492440	what's something that makes you really happy that you indulge in that kind of helps you stay
3493400	3498840	uh well it takes your mind off of things like what's something that's the you know just a
3500120	3506520	habit or a uh or an indulgence spending time with friends that's mostly it just spending time is
3506520	3509880	that what you said spending time with friend yes what do you do when you spend time with them just
3509880	3515240	chat just chat and talk about stories about her name was Mary so just talk about Mary and like
3515240	3519800	stories and share share funny stories oh so you're not taking your mind off it with anything
3519800	3523400	well more or less yeah we're not we're not spending 24 hours just talking about her constantly
3523400	3529160	we're just like chatting about different things but um but is there any so is that so so at this
3529160	3535480	point it's become like kind of it's all about remembering and stuff so you don't you don't
3535480	3542760	play minecraft no I knew you were hoping it's gonna say minecraft no but my uh my nephew he's
3542760	3548360	a big he's a big player okay does he play with mod packs yes he just recently started playing

3568600	3575560	with grief everybody just passing everything into a minecraft conversation then it's okay to cry
3575560	3581800	why well I'm not I yeah I mean I have no idea how I'll deal with death I mean it's it's
3581800	3589240	me neither I I'm really actually that's this that's that I I'm in denial about my denial about my
3589240	3594360	denial of death like it hasn't been put to the test at all yet and I've now I feel like there's
3594360	3599320	no wood to knock on and all this stuff and I just like yeah I can't even I've been so lucky and so
3599320	3608360	like untouched by that side of reality and I just can't I can't I I'm gonna I'm gonna show the world
3608360	3615960	the new definition of pussy when when anything bad happens to me like I'm I will I'm gonna be
3615960	3624520	up on my roof wailing at the moon for six years I felt like doing that sometimes I would is there
3624520	3631400	is there a way to do that are you do you have a therapist yes are they uh good yes yes no I'm
3631400	3637240	actually seeing two two of them yes did they both know it's like yes that's good that's good keep
3637240	3642360	them on their toes I like that I always start my therapy sessions but I take them through all the
3642360	3648520	previous therapists and like how I fired them like what I did um yeah one of them like I caught one
3648520	3653640	of them uh crying and they lied about it like they uh their their eyes were watering and I said why
3653800	3658120	why are you crying and they said because it's such an emotional story I said no it's not and uh
3658120	3664520	because it wasn't and then like 20 minutes later the therapist said uh I'm sorry I feel really bad
3664520	3670600	I had eye surgery recently uh cosmetic eye surgery like an eye tuck so my eyes are watering so my
3670600	3681160	instinct was to lie about it okay good session uh so go out there and be a good person then

3859320	3866760	canadian uh you're a texan tell me you'll leave if i don't give you enough money see i actually
3866760	3875240	i have a custom story okay um so i met a man on world of warcraft and you wait i'm sorry you
3875240	3880120	met a man on the world of warcraft i did yes we we did your boyfriend know about this man uh yeah
3880120	3884920	he's aware okay okay this was a long time ago this was around eight years ago something like that
3884920	3892680	okay uh so he's french canadian and we decided to elope but when i came through customs they
3892680	3900200	thought i was a mail-order bride because my ex-husband is much older than me and so they just
3900200	3904120	put us through the wringer every time i went through customs like i get pulled aside with
3904120	3909640	the immigrants for three hours and i have to wait they take me into a room and they grill me this
3909640	3914280	is canadian customs by the way this isn't us customs so they thought you were marrying a
3914520	3922600	canadian to become a canadian i think so yeah who does that i don't it's gonna happen a lot in
3922600	3928840	november yeah a lot of people will be doing that i mean is that even necessary isn't i thought i
3928840	3933560	thought that was like uh it seems that there's a black market you pay about three hundred thousand
3933560	3938120	dollars for the health care card because when you immigrate oh the health care thing of course so
3938120	3941640	there are people like trying to come up here and get like pharmaceuticals and stuff well you'll
3941640	3946040	have people that have cancer and cancer is so expensive to treat in the us that you come to
3946040	3952280	canada and it's much more manageable and all you have to do is marry some schmuck and pain what a
3952280	3957480	mind fuck that is like like oh there's cancer like cancer and cancer is so expensive what a
3957480	3965000	fucking like mind what the fuck is there did we kill god what is wrong with us cancer is so
3965000	3970680	expensive in america it's like the worst place to get cancer what the fuck is wrong with us it's
3970680	3977400	the easiest place and the worst place yeah yeah uh because it's probably wi-fi right wi-fi is giving
3977400	3984280	it to all of us i blame the wi-fi yeah so it's uh that time we cross with customs it took us
3984280	3990280	seven days and three attempts to get across the border to canada wait so they so they're
3990280	3994520	three attempts so what is a failed attempt like they go like you're you're you're just you're just
3994520	4000120	you don't love him you just want a band-aid and then they just they just they just get out of here
4000200	4005480	and you just go and then you try to come back in and they turn you around there's like a mile
4005480	4010200	between the two customs they turn you around and you have to go back through u.s customs and
4010200	4016040	explain why you were turned around at the canadian border and that's really awkward because when you
4016040	4020440	come back through they're like what the fuck are you doing here and then you're like oh well they
4020440	4026200	turned us around they're like really yeah why what do they know that we don't know if they don't
4026200	4031080	like you why should we like you and and the second time it's always the same customs we tried so
4031080	4036120	the second time we came back over they're like oh it's you again huh and they were like don't worry
4036120	4040920	you know canadian customs it's really shitty but you're okay with us you're always welcome back
4040920	4047400	into the united states and yeah i know it's it's really weird it's always been canadian customs
4047400	4054280	it's been a problem for me um shana can i ask you a question sure are you a drug mule no no no are
4054280	4062520	you holding no but you're in montreal you can find something i want to talk about how do you
4062520	4069320	fall in love with somebody over a world of we so we used to raid together a lot world of warcraft
4069320	4077480	by nature is uh time consuming and it's also very social so you spend a lot of time talking to
4077480	4083320	people and you work together in raids and you defeat bosses and that's very kind of dumbing
4083320	4089400	down what well is but um so i would spend probably eight nine hours a night with this
4089400	4095560	guy and my guilds doing raids and you just get to know a person over that time and we started talking
4095560	4102520	on um on msn messenger this was a long time ago and you're like lee roy jenkins i love you
4103320	4110680	pretty much yeah yeah exactly i would like to be mrs lee roy jenkins will you make me the happiest
4110760	4116280	at least i'll have chicken but the um yeah no so we met over there we got to know each other and
4116280	4122280	then eventually we decided to do the uh intelligent thing by eloping and then it turned out that that
4122280	4130520	was a bad idea how long did that marriage last almost five years oh yeah yeah divorce is a good
4130520	4135800	thing like i i've changed i've i've changed my position on this recently and it doesn't have
4135800	4141560	anything to do with like i like you know arian and i with a great tragically short marriage um
4141560	4147240	and but the not speaking about the marriage and the quality of it or especially the quality of
4147240	4154040	my partner at all like putting all of that aside the idea of divorce it's like it really like
4154600	4159960	shocks your system into letting go of a bunch of shit you didn't know you were like i always i
4159960	4163320	i always just had all these presuppositions i didn't even know i had about how you're supposed
4163320	4166680	to live the second half of a full life like like oh i'm supposed to do this i'm supposed to do
4166680	4170360	that and it's not that i'm not necessarily going to do those things now i may get married and have
4170360	4174440	kids or something like that but now i live in this world where i'm like oh i've none of that
4174440	4179480	is like a carryover from my midwestern upbringing like there's not any like tapes that i'm playing
4179480	4186120	in my head that i'm like following the soundtrack of uh and and so i i have to imagine like i think
4186120	4191080	divorce like psychologically is as beneficial as like coming out of the closet must be for somebody
4191080	4195960	who like comes out like because it's like okay i'm not gonna care as much about spilling um a drink
4196840	4201000	dinner anymore i'm not gonna like freak out because like i had to tell my parents i'm gay
4201000	4205320	or i had to look at them i had to tell everyone i invited to my wedding that it did thanks for
4205320	4209640	coming and like witnessing us and like well we talked about how in love we were and stuff and
4209640	4214280	we were just kidding like and then you and then you and then they go that's all right it was a
4214280	4218840	fun party thanks for inviting me i like wearing my suit and then and then you wake up the next day
4218840	4223240	and you're not dead and you're like holy shit i can do like okay i don't what's my favorite color
4223240	4228120	i don't know maybe i should have one um i hate i refuse to have a favorite color it's so fucking
4228120	4236120	dumb you know that you're a fan of the show john john phillip um what what is your do you
4237000	4243000	what is your reaction to happy people when you're in this time of grief like do you do you do you
4243560	4249160	do you secretly like like like like wish that they you know is there resentment is there
4250040	4254200	well there were some resentment especially towards my friend because their life sort of continue on
4254200	4259240	while mine has stopped but at one point you have to accept that that's how life is is that mine has
4259240	4263000	temporarily stopped that other people are allowed to have fun other people are allowed to enjoy
4263000	4270360	themselves and eventually i will that is a that is a double therapist uh talking this guy's got it
4270360	4277560	with both barrels you're like you're like cyber christ yeah i mean no cyber christ was evil that's
4277560	4281160	lawnmower man after the show if you're if you're hanging around like i'd love just to have a drink
4281160	4285080	and just chat with you about well for sure you probably will probably buy your own drinks after
4285080	4288840	after this at the bar i'm good with everybody by this guy we're gonna get you so fucked
4290200	4294360	whenever they open the bar i don't know it's like i'm not gonna let you back in the auto way you're
4294360	4299000	like no you're staying in montreal i got no problem with that are you going to the other shows
4299000	4304200	while you're here are you know that's the only one really i feel so like it's pressured and
4304200	4309800	embarrassed yes i know that's terrible like i came here to a like i should have had a letter and i
4309800	4317000	like i should have had an act i should have had a good material um i am going to do you do you
4317000	4324600	have like any not a rap beat but like a beautiful like a ballad kind of thing you're talking to me
4325320	4331400	yeah yeah let's uh let's see what we have here you know why i'm very curious to know what you're
4331400	4338040	about to do with this i just want to sing to to montreal and i don't think it's gonna make
4338040	4347720	john phillip feel better but uh it may make uh shana shana it may make shana bummed out
4348520	4354120	and i think john phillip will secretly like that that's my strategy
