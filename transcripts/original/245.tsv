0	14000	Yes! Yes, you lovely people, make some noise for yourself!
15000	18000	Harman Town is now in session!
19000	23000	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Spencer Brinton to the stage!
26000	28000	You can be louder than that if you want to
28000	35000	And now the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
36000	37000	Thank you!
37000	39000	Very, very kind of a thing!
41000	44000	A little late start where, you know, it's our new home.
44000	48000	If you're here for the third time, you see there's an evolution taking place.
48000	51000	You should be honored to be part of it.
51000	53000	You should be honored to be waiting for things.
53000	58000	Why is he still looking at his phone if there's an evolution?
58000	62000	Because the future hasn't happened. I don't have a fucking...
62000	66000	You should put your phone notes on the screen behind you.
66000	69000	Well, then the people can just see...
69000	70000	Exactly!
72000	74000	It'll speed things up.
80000	82000	What have I done?
83000	85000	I mean, this isn't really what I...
85000	88000	It's a bit of a nature video right now.
88000	91000	I mean, I don't even know... You don't even know... Okay.
91000	94000	No, this is stupid. Let me just...
95000	98000	It doesn't matter, because I'm not going to talk that much and then I'm going to bring it up.
98000	104000	We have a show chock full of entertainment and you guys are so lucky to be here and you're...
108000	111000	Yeah, you're plotting your own good fortune.
111000	113000	That's a great thing to applaud.
113000	115000	That's what people should applaud.
115000	120000	Like, I mean, gone are the days when you would applaud the entertainment itself.
121000	123000	Now you just applaud your own privilege.
123000	128000	You just go like, we are lucky to be here. I was told that by the fake news.
130000	131000	So here's the thing.
131000	134000	All right, let me just try to blow through some stuff that doesn't...
134000	137000	That deserves more than being blown through.
138000	142000	I'm drunk. I came up drunk. I usually get drunk during the show.
143000	147000	Because I was with my friend Joel Hodgson, who was celebrating with his Kickstarter supporters,
147000	151000	the Mystery Science Theater accomplishment that happened on Kickstarter.
153000	155000	So many funny people attached.
155000	159000	And I was dragged out and hoarded off to...
160000	162000	No offense to whores.
163000	167000	But I had a great time because you're just surrounded with people.
167000	170000	I was like, what? I got to hold court. That's what they call it. I held court.
170000	171000	Right.
171000	175000	Talking to people that have no choice but to stop talking when I interrupt them.
176000	178000	Oh, I'm interested in this video game.
178000	181000	Yeah, here's the thing about video games.
181000	183000	Okay, Dan's talking.
183000	186000	I thought this game's better than this one.
186000	190000	Well, you're a fat, rich windbag, so I guess that's true.
192000	196000	But yeah, we talked about so much stuff that I feel like I don't really have much show in me.
196000	199000	So I think we'll try to get it...
199000	201000	Okay, here's the thing.
201000	203000	Yeah, here we go. God damn it.
203000	205000	So we weren't here last week because I went on vacation.
205000	210000	It was my girlfriend's birthday. I went to Tulum, Mexico, the most amazing place in the world.
210000	215000	It doesn't need my help. It's already beautiful. It's monetized. It's fine.
215000	218000	But it's gorgeous there.
219000	223000	I got high on the beach and Cody went to get a drink.
223000	226000	Here's what happened to me.
226000	229000	Here's why I'm now going to be a perfect person.
231000	235000	First of all, it all starts with Trump because we're all feeling the same thing,
235000	240000	which is that we're all now living in a new space where we're like, no wrong answers.
241000	244000	Which is not just a glib thing to say.
244000	249000	It's true that we were living in a world where we were wondering if we were drinking too much coffee
249000	252000	or if we were saving enough for our retirement or if our mortgage payments meant this
252000	255000	or should I have kids or should I not have kids? What's my favorite color?
255000	261000	And then a rapist Nazi became president and he did it by tweeting horrible things.
261000	263000	He didn't do it by tricking anyone.
263000	265000	He just went like, I'm a rapist Nazi.
265000	269000	And everyone went, well, sometimes that's better than a woman. Yay!
269000	272000	And our nightmare just marched.
272000	277000	And all of the walls came down and I'm not saying it's a good thing.
277000	279000	And I'm not saying we needed that to happen.
279000	284000	But I am saying that at least we can find the positivity in that when it's like
284000	289000	when your paradigm shatters, you are on the verge of new epiphanies
289000	292000	that don't have to do with how much coffee you're drinking.
292000	296000	You have no choice now but to get up every morning and think about God
296000	301000	and whether he exists, whether he's a she, like you're out of shit.
301000	303000	You're an idiot if you're thinking about coffee.
303000	306000	There's a fucking Nazi in the White House.
306000	308000	So now you have to...
308000	310000	So anyways...
315000	318000	Is he affecting it now? Is he affecting the thing?
318000	321000	No, he's not. He has a problem.
321000	324000	He can't speak. He's not a professional entertainer.
326000	328000	He gets wound up.
328000	332000	I was on a day bed overlooking the beautiful Tulum Ocean.
332000	334000	I got high.
334000	337000	Cody went to go get drinks.
337000	340000	And I started doing this thing that I do when I'm happy,
340000	343000	which is I go back over my life and I torture myself.
343000	348000	I don't think this is just a Midwest thing.
348000	354000	There's such a fine line between gratitude and I'm about to get cancer.
354000	358000	Because gratitude means I have it so good.
358000	361000	Oh, I should really appreciate how good I have it.
361000	366000	To me, being from Wisconsin, that is identical to saying I'm about to get cancer.
366000	370000	And it's also identical to saying, oh, I don't deserve this
370000	373000	because I've been such a piece of shit.
373000	375000	And so I'm just sitting there looking over the ocean
375000	377000	and I'm going back over my life because my girlfriend's gone
377000	380000	and I can't hold her hand anymore and I can't be distracted by these things
380000	382000	that slow me down as my therapist says,
382000	384000	run on your engine, not on the pistons.
384000	388000	So I start running on the pistons and I'm going back over my life.
388000	391000	And I'm going, well, why did Sarah Silverman fire you?
391000	393000	Well, because you're a fucking idiot because you did this.
393000	396000	Why did you do that with Chevy Chase?
396000	399000	Why did you get fired from community?
399000	403000	Why didn't you just tow the line at Kung Fu Panda?
403000	410000	How many times have we all said that?
410000	417000	For most people, it's code.
417000	421000	Normally that's an exercise of just like, oh, you're out of the moment.
421000	422000	You're fucked up.
422000	423000	Now you were happy.
423000	426000	So you went back through your life and now you're torturing yourself.
426000	428000	But I followed through on it and I was like, okay,
428000	432000	so there's a version of me that didn't get fired, season four, community.
432000	436000	There's a version of me that didn't fuck up, that knew better.
436000	439000	Now, the Sarah Silverman show, there's a version of me that was like,
439000	444000	knew while working on Kung Fu Panda that no one cares about story structure.
444000	449000	They don't know that if a panda is born entitled to win,
449000	454000	that that makes him a villain.
454000	457000	It doesn't matter.
457000	459000	I made different choices.
459000	463000	I swiped a laminate at DreamWorks the animation
463000	468000	and went to work every day and went, you know your movie's shitty, right?
468000	472000	And they kept going like, well, it's probably going to be pretty good.
472000	476000	And I kept going, oh, these guys don't know what they're talking about.
476000	480000	So anyways, suffice to say, I have regrets.
480000	485000	I could have serviced the fans better, like season four of community
485000	489000	if I hadn't had a fucking meltdown, if I hadn't taken myself so seriously.
489000	492000	So I'm going over all of these decisions every fucking moment.
492000	494000	But here's what happens.
495000	498000	So I go, okay, so there's that version of me, there's that version of me,
498000	499000	there's that version of me.
499000	501000	So that guy's got more money.
501000	503000	That guy's working on a better show.
503000	504000	That guy transitioned.
504000	505000	He's a woman now.
505000	508000	You're welcome.
508000	510000	Like, whatever.
510000	512000	Like, all of the choices I could have made.
512000	516000	And I'm like, okay, so all of you guys,
516000	519000	like, what do you want?
519000	523000	What would you, what would you, what are you going for?
523000	527000	One of you has a Tesla, one of you has Spielberg and your Rolodex.
527000	530000	There was these things called Rolodexes.
530000	532000	What do all of you want?
532000	537000	And then I was like, I think all of them want to be on a beach in Tulum.
537000	541000	And then my girlfriend came in and I was like, holy shit, that's my girlfriend.
541000	543000	And I was like, whoa.
543000	545000	And I was like, oh, it is a simulation.
545000	546000	It's a simulation.
546000	549000	I'm in a cut scene.
549000	552000	Because it's a sandbox open world game.
552000	554000	But then there's a braiding point.
554000	558000	Because it doesn't matter what you do in a good game.
558000	562000	You come to a point where the designers said, yeah,
562000	567000	but then you end up at this specific point where you sit on a beach
567000	570000	and you go, this is who I am.
570000	575000	And the women know this is sliding doors that I'm describing.
575000	579000	Maybe not, maybe not the women in our audience.
579000	582000	But that's what I'm saying.
582000	583000	It was an epiphany.
583000	586000	I don't care if you understand it.
586000	590000	There's no way to react to an epiphany that registers to me
590000	592000	as I nailed my epiphany.
592000	593000	I'm just sharing it with you.
593000	595000	You were saying that you had so much fucking fun.
595000	599000	You had some broke flashbacks to when life was rough.
599000	600000	Well, that's also true.
600000	601000	Well, no.
601000	602000	Here's what you know.
602000	604000	I am broke right now, or I was broke for a little bit.
604000	612000	My checking balance was so low that I was feeling middle class.
612000	614000	Ew.
614000	615000	Disgusting.
615000	619000	Not one, but two of my assistants had to take me aside
619000	622000	and warn me that my checking account balance was so low.
622000	623000	Do you know how that feels?
623000	628000	I was just trying to mitigate Steve a little bit.
628000	633000	They don't do that unless they're worried they're not going to get paid.
633000	634000	I was like, why did you take me aside?
634000	637000	And they're like, because you were in front of the electronics guy
637000	640000	who was installing shit in your house and he might stop.
640000	642000	Yeah.
642000	643000	But, you know, whatever.
643000	644000	And then a check came in.
644000	646000	Let's not get distracted.
646000	651000	Like, here's the thing.
651000	652000	But it's not the thing.
652000	654000	I'm tired of saying here's the thing.
654000	656000	I don't know the thing.
656000	662000	Like, I'm...
662000	664000	Like, okay.
664000	668000	So, like, if you...
668000	670000	Here's what I realized.
670000	673000	I started going, okay, so let's say Elon Musk is right.
673000	676000	And I know it's not his idea, but we're a simulation.
676000	678000	So we're playing a game.
678000	682000	Okay, so all games are based on deprivation of something.
682000	684000	Like, you spin a kid around.
684000	685000	They don't know how to stand.
685000	689000	Wouldn't it be funny if they pinned a tail on something?
689000	692000	There's no party game where you give the kid a tail
692000	694000	and a donkey with a tail slot.
694000	695000	And you go, like, well, good.
695000	698000	So you're not an idiot.
698000	700000	We purposely deprive people of things.
700000	703000	We put boxes on our heads, and we watch each other in turn,
703000	705000	like, flounder around.
705000	710000	So if life is a simulation, like, what if it's a party game?
710000	711000	What if we're each taking turns?
711000	713000	And what if...
713000	717000	Knock it off, you piece of shit.
717000	722000	You fucking impoverished piece of garbage, you.
722000	725000	What did I do wrong to let you in here?
725000	730000	Now, see, I lost it.
730000	732000	In those moments when you...
732000	734000	Video game.
734000	736000	Yes, thank you.
736000	738000	When you're sad, when you're in love,
738000	740000	when you've been dumped, when you're angry,
740000	744000	when you're feeling racist, when you're feeling angry,
744000	748000	when you're too tall, when you're too short,
748000	751000	when you're having these heightened experiences,
751000	755000	if you imagine that it's a bit...
755000	759000	How can I imagine that my crippling pain is a bit, Dan?
759000	762000	My health care just got gutted.
762000	766000	Well, okay, I'll get to you in a second.
767000	769000	There are people...
769000	771000	If you imagine philosophically,
771000	773000	and this is something that even an atheist can imagine
773000	774000	without violating your atheism,
774000	777000	because it's not an actual religion, it's just a philosophy.
777000	781000	Just imagine a party full of people watching you
781000	783000	with a box on your head going,
783000	786000	Look at him! Look at him go!
786000	789000	Oh, shit, he's on to us! He's on to it!
789000	791000	Like, when you look into the eyes of your lover
791000	793000	and you go, like, this is where I...
793000	795000	This is it. This is where I'm meant to be.
795000	797000	And then they go, like, whoa!
797000	799000	But they're also not mad at you for blowing it.
799000	800000	Like, if you're just jerking off
800000	802000	and playing Minecraft for three days, they're not like,
802000	803000	He's losing!
803000	805000	There's no wrong way to do it.
805000	808000	It's a party game.
808000	810000	I just wanted to get that out.
810000	813000	I don't care. You're too dumb to get it.
813000	814000	That's not true.
814000	817000	It's like Roy and Rick and Morty.
817000	819000	Yeah.
819000	822000	It's exactly like that.
823000	825000	No, I know it's not a new concept
825000	827000	or it's not something we haven't explored already.
827000	830000	The emotional epiphany is just the imagination.
830000	833000	Instead of Rick watching you play Roy,
833000	835000	what if it was, like, people you loved?
835000	837000	What if every time I look at Spencer,
837000	839000	like, either Spencer's an AI
839000	843000	that's, like, designed to pull certain behaviors out of me,
843000	847000	or Spencer represents an octopus Spencer
847000	849000	that's, like, part of my species.
849000	852000	But in either case, like, I can look at Spencer
852000	854000	and go, like, I get it.
854000	856000	It's just, we're just fucking around.
856000	858000	And then you just, you can hear, like,
858000	860000	a choir of octopus angels going,
860000	862000	Yay!
862000	863000	I don't know.
863000	865000	I give up. I give up.
865000	868000	We have a lot of show. I'm sorry.
868000	869000	You'll figure it out.
869000	870000	Don't, no!
870000	872000	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
872000	873000	No!
873000	874000	Yes.
874000	875000	Oh, yeah.
875000	878000	You deserve it because you literally went away,
878000	880000	came back so happy you didn't even know
880000	882000	what the fuck to talk about.
882000	883000	That's awesome.
883000	884000	I had a good vacation.
884000	887000	Yeah!
887000	888000	Don't patronize me.
888000	891000	And that is all right.
891000	896000	You ain't got to feel bad about that.
896000	898000	I saw it get out.
898000	904000	Awesome!
904000	906000	Yeah.
906000	907000	It was good.
907000	908000	It was a pretty good movie.
908000	909000	All right.
909000	910000	We got a lot of show, so let's just...
910000	912000	Ha, ha, ha, ha!
912000	913000	It was a really good movie.
913000	914000	We were just talking about it over there
914000	915000	while we were waiting to come out,
915000	917000	so I'm all talked out about get out.
917000	922000	But you've already seen it, so...
922000	926000	Our next guest...
926000	928000	Created Mystery Science Theater 3000.
928000	935000	Joel Hodgson is here.
935000	936000	Hi, Joel.
936000	937000	Sorry.
937000	939000	Sorry.
939000	944000	Hey, y'all.
944000	945000	Okay.
945000	946000	Take me up, Dan.
946000	947000	Sorry I took so long.
947000	948000	That's okay.
948000	949000	Show me what you're seeing tonight.
949000	950000	Let's go.
950000	951000	What?
951000	952000	What do you mean?
952000	953000	What's going on in your heart?
953000	954000	Oh, oh, oh.
954000	955000	Oh, wait.
955000	956000	You just did that.
956000	957000	Yeah, I did.
957000	958000	You did that.
958000	959000	Okay.
959000	960000	Yeah, so I know...
960000	962000	I mean, the reason we were together tonight
962000	967000	is because you've recently resurrected MST.
967000	972000	Thank you.
972000	973000	And you did it through crowdfunding,
973000	974000	and what is it on?
974000	975000	Netflix?
975000	976000	What's the...
976000	977000	It's on Netflix, yeah.
977000	979000	There's 14 new Mystery Science Theaters right now.
979000	980000	And they're all just dumped out there?
980000	981000	You can just watch them?
981000	982000	They're right.
982000	983000	Yeah, they came out like three or four weeks ago.
983000	984000	All right.
984000	985000	I didn't feel like...
985000	987000	I don't think any of my jokes got used.
987000	988000	Yeah.
988000	1004340	I think the
1018000	1020000	question was, even before I did,
1020000	1022000	because we met at Comic-Con,
1022000	1026000	like when I was selling comic books,
1026000	1031000	you were a person that I recognized from television
1031000	1033000	that Shrab and I, therefore, when we...
1033000	1038000	You were so nice to us, treated us like equals,
1038000	1040000	and therefore, when we moved to LA,
1040000	1043000	we had your number and we're hanging out with you,
1043000	1045000	and you were still treating us like equals
1045000	1047000	and kind of mentoring us,
1047000	1049000	and you were from the Midwest,
1049000	1051000	moving to this weird city and industry,
1051000	1053000	and you were also from the Midwest
1053000	1055000	and had been there a little longer,
1055000	1059000	and were truly like I...
1059000	1063000	The stuff that you told us,
1063000	1068000	probably definitely helped a lot.
1068000	1071000	Like just the idea of like,
1071000	1075000	everyone out here is a fucking idiot, man.
1075000	1078000	You've got to accept that.
1078000	1081000	The secret to happiness is like the day you wake up
1081000	1086000	and you're like, holy shit, everyone's fucking dumb.
1086000	1088000	You might be embellishing there.
1088000	1089000	I'm not sure.
1089000	1090000	Yeah, I remember that lesson.
1090000	1092000	Well, you guys were adorable, man,
1092000	1093000	when I met you and Shrab.
1093000	1095000	I just, you know, had to be friends.
1095000	1097000	You guys were great.
1097000	1103000	I got just as much from you guys as you got from me.
1103000	1104000	I want to talk about crowdfunding,
1104000	1106000	because you just did this thing,
1106000	1108000	and we did crowdfunding with Anomaly,
1108000	1110000	so we worked with Kickstarter.
1110000	1111000	There's actually...
1111000	1113000	You have a friend here who, like,
1113000	1115000	he's more qualified to talk about it,
1115000	1119000	and could we do a Kickstarter for me to remember his name?
1119000	1121000	His name is Ivan Askwith, and...
1121000	1122000	Let's bring him up.
1122000	1123000	Before we do,
1123000	1125000	I want to just kind of prep the audience for him.
1125000	1126000	He's kind of...
1126000	1127000	He has a mole on his forehead
1127000	1128000	that's like the size of a basket.
1128000	1129000	Yeah, don't look at it.
1129000	1131000	If you look at it, he flips out.
1131000	1132000	It's not fun.
1132000	1134000	That's why he got into Kickstarter.
1134000	1138000	But Ivan has so much to do with the success of our Kickstarter.
1138000	1140000	I worked with him every day on it,
1140000	1143000	and he really helped me so much
1143000	1145000	in understanding how to work with a...
1145000	1147000	You know, we had 50,000 backers,
1147000	1150000	and we gave them updates almost on a weekly level,
1150000	1152000	and he was...
1152000	1154000	We worked, collaborated together,
1154000	1157000	and how to talk to them and how to keep them abreast
1157000	1159000	of what we were working on with MST,
1159000	1161000	and he's just probably...
1161000	1163000	He's writing the book on how to do this.
1163000	1165000	He's an expert on it, and he's...
1165000	1168000	Aside from doing our Kickstarter campaign,
1168000	1172000	he's responsible for all the other top Kickstarter campaigns
1172000	1175000	like Veronica Mars and Reading Rainbow
1175000	1178000	and Super Troopers 2, so he's really an expert at it.
1178000	1179000	So it's Ivan Askwith.
1179000	1180000	You want to come on up, Ivan?
1180000	1181000	Bring him up, man.
1181000	1182000	Thank you.
1188000	1191000	See, I'm doing a Carson style where I move down
1191000	1193000	and then he moves over.
1193000	1195000	You told him about the mole on my forehead.
1195000	1196000	Yeah, sorry. It's weird.
1196000	1198000	Go ahead. Just flash it. Yeah.
1198000	1200000	I just think it's easy.
1200000	1203000	Ooh! There's no mole, you idiots.
1203000	1205000	I mean, it...
1205000	1208000	It...unavoidably sounds like a weird keynote
1208000	1211000	like we're at some Silicon Valley company now
1211000	1214000	introducing you because you didn't create Batman
1214000	1217000	or design the rainbow in Reading Rainbow,
1217000	1221000	but you figured out in an emerging age...
1221000	1223000	You're a piece of shit!
1223000	1228000	You're a spontaneously evolved person
1228000	1231000	in a new food chain that hasn't had time to become old,
1231000	1233000	which is crowdfunding.
1233000	1235000	There's a tightrope here.
1235000	1238000	We did a Kickstarter with Anomalisa,
1238000	1241000	and I'll be the first to admit, we didn't know what we were doing.
1241000	1243000	We fucked up in a lot of ways.
1243000	1245000	You need to update and all this stuff,
1245000	1249000	but how much are you allowed to talk about the Zach Braff thing?
1249000	1252000	Not to throw him under the bus and shit on him,
1252000	1256000	but to talk about him as a milestone of crowdfunding
1256000	1259000	where the consciousness had to change.
1259000	1260000	You know what?
1260000	1263000	I think it's easier to just get him to talk about his worldview,
1263000	1265000	and how he looks at it.
1265000	1267000	Joel's going to take all my questions for me.
1267000	1269000	I want you to do that,
1269000	1272000	and then you can come back around to it if you want to.
1272000	1274000	What can I come back around to?
1274000	1277000	I think it's the Zach Braff thing.
1277000	1280000	Look, pretend I never said anything,
1280000	1282000	but if I didn't say anything,
1282000	1284000	it's not like you just start talking.
1284000	1287000	Something has to be said to you.
1287000	1290000	You can start talking at the drop of a hat, believe me.
1290000	1291000	What's that?
1291000	1293000	He can talk at the drop of a hat.
1293000	1294000	Let's go ahead and get that started.
1294000	1296000	Is this weird for anybody else?
1296000	1297000	Just me?
1297000	1299000	I guess we'll start with Zach Braff,
1299000	1300000	and then we'll work our way back around.
1300000	1301000	No, don't.
1301000	1302000	I'm kidding.
1302000	1303000	We're going to come around to Zach Braff.
1303000	1305000	So in like 1960, Zach Braff was born.
1305000	1306000	Awesome.
1306000	1307000	I think we've covered that.
1307000	1308000	Now let's just see what you do.
1308000	1311000	Joel's theory is that it's okay for you
1311000	1314000	to just start talking about your worldview,
1314000	1318000	and I'd like you to do that just to prove him wrong.
1319000	1321000	You'd like me to do it to prove him wrong or right?
1321000	1322000	Well, no, prove him right.
1322000	1323000	Oh, right.
1323000	1324000	Make that your goal.
1324000	1329000	My speculation is you will prove him wrong.
1329000	1331000	My worldview or my crowd worldview?
1331000	1333000	Just start talking about your worldview.
1333000	1334000	Explain your worldview.
1334000	1335000	Explain your worldview.
1335000	1336000	Explain your worldview.
1336000	1338000	That's how all good interviews start.
1338000	1341000	So in the beginning, there was Dan Harmon.
1341000	1343000	Is that what I'm supposed to...
1343000	1344000	That's your worldview?
1344000	1346000	He told me at dinner that he's a monotheistic guy.
1346000	1349000	How does that relate to the Zach Braff thing?
1349000	1352000	Yeah, get the Zach Braff thing out of the way,
1352000	1356000	because it's really fucking up Dan.
1356000	1358000	So what was the question?
1358000	1359000	Worldview.
1359000	1360000	Worldview.
1360000	1361000	Was Zach Braff's worldview?
1361000	1362000	No.
1362000	1364000	What's your worldview?
1364000	1365000	That's a big question.
1365000	1366000	It is.
1366000	1367000	Okay, well then let me...
1367000	1368000	Joel was wrong.
1368000	1369000	Is that what you want me to say?
1369000	1370000	Yes.
1370000	1371000	Thank you.
1371000	1372000	Joel was wrong.
1372000	1373000	Here's Kickstarter.
1373000	1375000	Give me money so I can make something.
1375000	1376000	Nope.
1376000	1377000	Right.
1377000	1379000	So explain the nuance.
1379000	1381000	What's the nuance that we learned there?
1381000	1384000	So I think the big misconception on Kickstarter
1384000	1387000	is that people are giving money because they want to do somebody a favor,
1387000	1388000	and it's not.
1388000	1391000	Usually if it's going well, people feel like you're doing them a favor
1391000	1394000	by making this thing possible that they want.
1394000	1397000	So I had a conversation with Zach Braff's team
1397000	1398000	when they were in the middle of their campaign.
1398000	1401000	I had a much weirder conversation with Mike Lee's team.
1401000	1402000	That's interesting.
1402000	1403000	You talked to Zach Braff's people.
1403000	1404000	Yeah.
1404000	1406000	Well, I...
1406000	1407000	It was.
1407000	1408000	We talked about my worldview.
1408000	1409000	Mostly.
1409000	1412000	So you can ask him what it is if you ever have him on.
1412000	1414000	No, I mean, I think the...
1414000	1418000	I was telling you just before we came up that maybe his fault, maybe not,
1418000	1421000	but Zach Braff's campaign is kind of like the cautionary tale for people now,
1421000	1424000	not just because he was like one of the first people to come on.
1424000	1427000	And he came just after Veronica Mars, which was a weird moment for everybody
1427000	1429000	because Kickstarter is kind of seen as this space
1429000	1432000	where like people who have no resources can suddenly make a good pitch
1432000	1434000	to everybody and see if they want to give them some resources.
1434000	1435000	Right.
1435000	1437000	And instead, Veronica Mars is this thing owned by Warner Brothers
1437000	1439000	who have a decent number of resources.
1439000	1440000	Right.
1440000	1441000	Usually.
1441000	1444000	And people were like, why the fuck is Kickstarter asking...
1444000	1446000	Or why is Warner Brothers asking people to give money
1446000	1447000	for this thing that they could easily fund?
1447000	1448000	Right.
1448000	1452000	So right after that succeeded, Zach Braff was kind of like next out the gate.
1452000	1455000	And the problem was he didn't have a very good explanation,
1455000	1458000	in most people's opinion, for why he was asking for money
1458000	1460000	when it was really clear on like Scrub's fuck you money
1460000	1463000	that he could have just funded the entire thing himself
1463000	1466000	on one episode's salary, or at least that was what everybody thought.
1466000	1470000	And it got worse after he actually got the money.
1470000	1472000	Like he got what he was looking for.
1472000	1475000	And then it started getting worse for him because the main argument
1475000	1477000	for why he wanted money was he wanted creative freedom.
1477000	1479000	And people were like, but you have your own money.
1479000	1481000	That is creative freedom.
1481000	1483000	And he used everybody else's money.
1483000	1485000	But then as I was telling you,
1485000	1489000	the thing started to go sour when the first update that he sent to everybody,
1489000	1492000	to tell them how much he appreciated the money that he really needed from them,
1492000	1495000	was on a GoPro video shot on the back of his jet ski.
1495000	1496000	Right.
1496000	1499000	With like a cool hit indie soundtrack.
1499000	1501000	I'm not even kidding.
1501000	1503000	And then the second one was a little better.
1503000	1505000	It was a GoPro from the back of a motorcycle.
1505000	1507000	Still not kidding.
1507000	1512000	But, you know, and I think the kind of really bad moment for him was that he,
1512000	1515000	I think he thought of it just like every other project he had gotten funded.
1515000	1516000	He was like, I have the money now.
1516000	1517000	Now it's my thing.
1517000	1518000	I do what I want with it.
1518000	1523000	And it wasn't necessarily a clear sense that he owed all these people who had given five.
1523000	1530000	Basically what you're doing is you're breaking up the five people who normally are paid by a corporation.
1530000	1534000	These fat cats, you're breaking them up into possibly hundreds of thousands of people.
1534000	1537000	And that collectively, they're now your Weinstein.
1537000	1540000	You actually work for them and you owe them these updates.
1540000	1544000	Or at least you owe them to not take them for granted is like the problem, right?
1544000	1545000	Like I think people don't necessarily,
1545000	1548000	it's misleading to think that people mostly care about the rewards.
1548000	1553000	What they mostly care about is not being treated like they're a nuisance to you after they made this thing possible.
1553000	1554000	Right.
1554000	1560000	So in his case, the like really bad moment was at Sundance when Wish I Was Here premiered.
1560000	1564000	And not only were his backers not given a heads up that it was going to be premiering,
1564000	1568000	but I think the New York Times got a photo of one of his backers who had given a couple thousand dollars
1568000	1570000	standing in front of the theater because they hadn't been able to get a ticket,
1570000	1573000	holding up a cardboard sign like a homeless person saying,
1573000	1576000	Backer from Kickstarter will pay for tickets to my own moving.
1576000	1578000	And yeah, it didn't go over well.
1578000	1584000	I'm sure there's probably people in this audience with some, there's gotta be, with Anomalisa.
1584000	1587000	You actually took over for Anomalisa.
1587000	1591000	Wait, can we talk about his worldview now?
1591000	1592000	Just get that out of the way.
1592000	1595000	All right, but I'm telling you while you were in the bathroom,
1595000	1597000	I checked in on his worldview.
1597000	1600000	He is so racist.
1600000	1602000	I saw it get out.
1602000	1604000	He's a new racist.
1604000	1606000	It's like a 90s band.
1606000	1610000	Yeah.
1610000	1614000	But that's the interesting thing about you is, by the way, you don't work for Kickstarter.
1614000	1615000	No.
1615000	1617000	You're kind of a freelancer.
1617000	1621000	That's what's interesting to me is that that's the healthy part of capitalism,
1621000	1626000	is that crowdsourcing popped up, which is vastly superior in my opinion.
1626000	1631000	Forget about ethics and karma and like, oh, give the people their TV and movies.
1631000	1639000	It's just more efficient to say to people, hey, I'm thinking of making a Knight Rider reboot.
1639000	1646000	I need $5 million to do what I have in mind if enough people,
1646000	1654000	and only if enough people are so interested in it that they can pledge the money in advance to see it,
1654000	1657000	then I can make it.
1657000	1659000	That's the amazing thing about the studio system, right?
1659000	1661000	Everyone racks their brains and worries about getting fired,
1661000	1663000	because they're like, how do we figure out what the audience likes?
1663000	1667000	Nobody knows what the audience likes, except, of course, the audience, if you just ask them.
1667000	1668000	Right.
1668000	1670000	Which you now can with clicking and...
1670000	1671000	Right.
1671000	1673000	You can find out whether anybody would want to show up for the thing that you want to make,
1673000	1675000	and if they don't, you don't have to waste your time on it.
1675000	1678000	This is what you were saying earlier this evening,
1678000	1679000	is it's nice.
1679000	1682000	It's not that you're begging people for money, which is what some people think it is.
1682000	1686000	It's that you're finding out before you put two years of your life into doing a new project
1686000	1688000	whether anybody gives a fuck about that project.
1688000	1689000	Right.
1689000	1692000	It's also good creatively, too, because you have to billboard a few ideas,
1692000	1698000	so I think it's actually helped me kind of put forward what are the new things in MST
1698000	1703000	or what can I show you about it that's kind of an innovation or a feature.
1703000	1705000	Well, because we're kind of spoiled.
1705000	1708000	We're coming from a world where those are the suits,
1708000	1712000	and it's easy for us to look at them as mommy and daddy, and we're creative,
1712000	1717000	and if you would just let me stop doing math homework
1717000	1721000	and start doing this thing that I really want to do, then I'd do it.
1721000	1725000	But the truth is, yeah, no one wants to write an outline.
1725000	1728000	No one wants to figure out what the fuck you're going to do.
1728000	1734000	I didn't want to throw Braff under the bus.
1734000	1737000	He made some pretty honest mistakes.
1737000	1741000	I think that was an interesting thing that we went through all those years ago,
1741000	1744000	where it was like, oh, Kickstarter started, and it was like,
1744000	1746000	oh, this guy doesn't have a finger,
1746000	1749000	and he wants to come up with a prosthetic finger
1749000	1753000	that all the prosthetic companies won't allow him to make.
1753000	1754000	Can I have money?
1754000	1757000	And it was easy to think of it as like, oh, that's what crowdfunding is.
1757000	1760000	It's us revolting against the system
1760000	1763000	and funding things that couldn't exist otherwise.
1763000	1766000	And see, if you want the closest thing I have to a worldview,
1766000	1769000	because I don't have a worldview, but I have a view on like...
1769000	1771000	Just say it's your worldview, and let's move on.
1771000	1774000	So my worldview is basically that in this space,
1774000	1776000	the thing that interests me about it is not the money.
1776000	1778000	The money's the least interesting part of crowdfunding,
1778000	1780000	and I get kind of like itchy and pissed off
1780000	1783000	when people are like, oh, that guy's a crowdfunding guru,
1783000	1785000	which is what Joel now makes the point of telling everybody
1785000	1786000	when he introduces me to them.
1786000	1788000	Because to me, the money isn't the interesting part.
1788000	1791000	The fact that the crowd at large has the chance to say,
1791000	1794000	this is what we want, and we're tired of people ignoring us
1794000	1795000	when we say we'd rather...
1795000	1798000	It's the Futurama meme, like shut up and take my money.
1798000	1801000	Yeah, well, because the people that...
1801000	1802000	Capitalism and populism are...
1802000	1804000	It's not like they're removed from each other.
1804000	1806000	It's not like people that want to make money are constantly going,
1806000	1809000	oh, what all those people want is so disgusting to me.
1809000	1811000	They use it, they throw it in the face of people.
1811000	1813000	They go, well, the people wanted it.
1813000	1816000	So it's like, just connect those wires, whatever.
1816000	1819000	Why am I explaining this to a nation of people that already know?
1819000	1822000	All right.
1822000	1824000	So your worldview is basically like...
1824000	1825000	I know you voted for Trump.
1825000	1827000	You explained to me.
1827000	1831000	It's part of being a racist.
1831000	1832000	We should...
1832000	1834000	We have cards that instruct us.
1834000	1835000	We have limited shares.
1835000	1837000	Is there anything that...
1837000	1838000	Because I want to bring up our...
1838000	1839000	Actual guests, yeah.
1839000	1846000	I want Joel to stay because I value his disruption.
1846000	1852000	But you, I'm going to trade for other people, so I...
1852000	1853000	It's okay.
1853000	1854000	He can take it.
1854000	1856000	It's a simulation, so it's totally worth it.
1856000	1857000	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
1857000	1858000	It's fun.
1858000	1860000	You and I will talk when you're ready for six seasons in a movie.
1860000	1861000	I don't...
1867000	1868000	Yeah, see...
1868000	1869000	Well, okay.
1869000	1870000	So there's a thing I can't...
1870000	1871000	That's the thing.
1871000	1873000	In a post Veronica Mars world, like, I feel...
1873000	1874000	Sometimes I feel like...
1874000	1875000	No, I'm not getting off the stage.
1875000	1878000	Well, I do feel like people go...
1878000	1880000	How come Dan doesn't love community?
1880000	1882000	How come he doesn't want to help us out?
1882000	1886000	Because if he did, wouldn't he just jump on the internet and say...
1886000	1890000	Who wants to pay me a dollar, a ticket?
1890000	1893000	I need $40 million to make the community movie and all this stuff.
1893000	1894000	It's like...
1897000	1900000	Can you tell me why I'm not doing that?
1901000	1905000	In a way that will make some people feel less like I...
1905000	1908000	It's like a sympathy not liking.
1908000	1909000	I could guess a bunch of different reasons.
1909000	1912000	And I can tell you why Joss Whedon doesn't do it with Firefly,
1912000	1914000	which is the other one besides you that people keep asking for.
1914000	1920000	And that's that just because the possibility is there doesn't mean that it's necessarily what you want to do with the next chunk of your life,
1920000	1923000	or it doesn't mean that there's a story you want to tell just because people want a story told.
1923000	1926000	Like, if you had an idea and you had no other way to do it,
1926000	1929000	and you were itching to tell that story, then maybe you'd be looking at it.
1929000	1933000	But to do it just because it's what people are clamoring for doesn't mean that you're going to get excited enough to make something right.
1933000	1938000	So you're saying the reason there's not a community movie is because Dan doesn't like community.
1940000	1943000	That's pretty... that's my worldview.
1943000	1947000	I heard it's because I'm like Joss Whedon. That's what I heard.
1947000	1950000	I feel like you... your simulation is glitching.
1950000	1952000	Oh, no.
1953000	1957000	I didn't raise any money to remember your name, so I...
1957000	1959000	It's okay. I've been asked with.
1959000	1960000	It's still Ivan.
1960000	1961000	What is it?
1961000	1962000	Ivan.
1962000	1963000	Ivan.
1963000	1964000	Okay.
1965000	1967000	Rushagate.
1970000	1972000	But is there anything I want to honor?
1972000	1975000	Because you came up, stuck your neck out, and put up with this.
1975000	1979000	So is there anything from your worldview that you want to plug anything?
1979000	1982000	Tip anybody off to any fucking projects?
1982000	1989000	You're cooking up any... is there a Knight Rider series that needs people to click on or any projects?
1990000	1993000	I mean, I'm supposed to talk to Justin about something.
1993000	1994000	Really?
1994000	1995000	Oh, shit.
1995000	1996000	Maybe.
1996000	2001000	About the fact that I'm always out of the loop on Justin projects?
2003000	2004000	No comment.
2004000	2007000	What are you supposed to talk about, Justin?
2009000	2011000	What is he up to now?
2013000	2017000	First you hold back on the Zach Braff. Now you hold him back on Justin?
2019000	2020000	We want to know.
2020000	2023000	What is Rick and Wernie being deprived of that it needs to be crowdfunded?
2023000	2027000	It's a fucking virtual reality project, isn't it? He's obsessed.
2028000	2031000	I genuinely don't know what he wants to talk about.
2031000	2035000	He might just want to introduce you to, like, a porn star or something.
2036000	2037000	If there's money in it, yeah.
2037000	2038000	Yeah.
2038000	2041000	You're gonna come over to my house. It's gonna be great.
2046000	2048000	Those pickups never end well.
2049000	2051000	I never get invited anymore.
2053000	2055000	It's all right. There'll still be a season four.
2056000	2057000	We'll figure it out.
2057000	2061000	All right. Well, so let's thank Ivan for sharing.
2061000	2064000	Ivan, ask with.
2067000	2068000	Okay.
2068000	2073000	And let's immediately now, because I've eaten into their time,
2073000	2078000	let's bring up Robert Evans and Magenta Vaughn, and we'll tell you.
2079000	2085000	All right. Sorry, you guys. I don't know.
2085000	2086000	What are you apologizing for?
2086000	2088000	I apologize too much. Yeah. For all you know,
2088000	2091000	it's part of the format of the show for me to not bring up that one.
2091000	2092000	All right.
2092000	2095000	So first, let's just, I'd like you to explain your worldview.
2097000	2100000	It's shit except for the stuff that's not, and that stuff's all right.
2100000	2102000	That's what I think sometimes.
2103000	2108000	We weren't talking about upstairs just to skip around because I'm a bad interviewer.
2108000	2111000	You just came back from the Middle East. You were in Iraq. Iraq and Turkey.
2111000	2112000	Yeah, but mostly Iraq.
2113000	2117000	So really right in the Middle East. Yeah, right in the middle.
2117000	2120000	We had to cross the Tigris to get where we were going.
2121000	2123000	The part when the Middle East isn't prepared properly,
2123000	2125000	and it's the first place that's like cold.
2126000	2127000	Okay.
2130000	2134000	But you were talking about like Rick and Morty fans in Iraq.
2134000	2136000	Was it Iraq? Yeah, it was Iraq.
2137000	2140000	And we were talking about the fact that somebody quoted,
2140000	2142000	you take it so that someone's talking other than me.
2142000	2144000	Yeah, so we've got a couple of friends out there,
2144000	2147000	and one of them is this guy, I.R., who's like 27 years old,
2147000	2150000	and his day job is taking journalists from Erbil,
2150000	2153000	which is a safe city in northern Iraq, to Mosul,
2153000	2155000	which is the city where all the ISIS guys are.
2155000	2158000	So like one day he'll be in college studying for his business degree,
2158000	2161000	and the next day he'll be like taking sniper fire with the guys from Vice
2161000	2164000	or the guys from The New Yorker or the guys from The New York Times or The Guardian.
2164000	2167000	Like he's worked with everybody that's done anything out there.
2167000	2168000	You mean fake news?
2168000	2169000	What's that?
2169000	2170000	Fake news?
2170000	2171000	Definitely.
2171000	2172000	Sounds like fake news.
2172000	2173000	Yeah, okay.
2173000	2175000	He's where the fake news comes from.
2175000	2176000	All right, gotcha.
2177000	2181000	So this guy, like he's a perfectly normal dude.
2181000	2184000	We'll talk about The Simpsons or whatever, just like Facebook.
2184000	2187000	Like he loves, like he shot a Mannequin Challenge video
2187000	2189000	with members of the Iraqi army.
2189000	2192000	Like while they were under sniper fire, like he went up to these guys
2192000	2195000	and he was like, there's this thing called The Mannequin Challenge
2195000	2196000	and I want to do it with you?
2196000	2199000	And they were like, no, that's the dumbest idea in the world.
2199000	2200000	But then he described it and they were like,
2200000	2203000	oh, well, that's what we're supposed to do under sniper fire.
2204000	2205000	It's decidedly not.
2205000	2207000	Oh, okay, because they're like this.
2207000	2209000	Yeah, they're standing, it was dangerous.
2209000	2211000	Oh, God, that's awful.
2211000	2215000	Can you imagine anything more horrible than a Mannequin Challenge video
2215000	2217000	where midway through it?
2217000	2218000	I mean, we've got it.
2218000	2219000	We can show it later if you want.
2219000	2221000	Okay, but it doesn't end horribly.
2221000	2223000	No, that one doesn't end horribly.
2223000	2225000	Please, God, I want to see this.
2226000	2229000	We're going to delineate a visual chapter of the show
2229000	2233000	for our audio only participants so that we can either edit it out
2233000	2235000	or they can plug their eyes.
2235000	2236000	Sure.
2236000	2240000	But, yeah, I just don't want to pepper the show with a ton of visuals.
2240000	2241000	Yeah.
2241000	2245000	All right, anyways, but just to finish that random thought.
2245000	2248000	When we leave, I give this guy like my copies of Rick and Morty,
2248000	2251000	Seasons 1 and 2, and he sends me like a Facebook message the day we get back,
2251000	2254000	and he's like, this is the show I've been waiting for all my life.
2254000	2256000	This is the best thing I've ever watched.
2256000	2259000	And he posts like a Rick meme to his Facebook, like Rick looking sad
2259000	2262000	because he had like a tough day at school, like the next day.
2262000	2264000	And one of his friends who we'd met on the trip,
2264000	2267000	who also leads journalists up to the front line, immediately posted,
2267000	2270000	nobody belongs anywhere, you know, that whole quote,
2270000	2272000	like everyone's going to die, let's go watch TV.
2272000	2273000	Right.
2273000	2276000	Because if you've grown up as a kid in Iraq your entire life,
2277000	2280000	like you're tuned into the same global media culture as everybody in this room,
2280000	2284000	like we've all watched Time Cop and Commando and whatever in community.
2284000	2286000	But like also sometimes your friends explode
2286000	2288000	because that's just like the nature of the world you live in.
2288000	2290000	Like IR, we'd be talking with him about like bullshit,
2290000	2293000	and then randomly he'd mention, oh, sorry, my suspension's messed up,
2293000	2295000	there was a car bomb, and I got stuck in traffic,
2295000	2298000	and it blew up next to my car, so the suspension's all fucked.
2298000	2302000	Like, so they're perfectly set up for that kind of humor
2303000	2306000	where it's like the darkness makes it feel right to them,
2306000	2307000	like they don't shrink away.
2307000	2309000	Yeah, and when I heard that, I thought that was it,
2309000	2312000	because that reminded me of a thing my therapist was talking about,
2312000	2316000	which was she watched something,
2316000	2319000	I think it was a documentary about women in war,
2319000	2323000	and not meaning women that put on a Kevlar vest and go out there,
2323000	2328000	like Vasquez and aliens, but in traditional cultures
2328000	2331000	where the men go away and then the boys go away
2331000	2338000	and meanwhile there's just rubble and a need to continue
2338000	2342000	as if life will continue after whatever's going on,
2342000	2349000	and the psychological capacity of nurturers to be like,
2349000	2352000	I don't fucking care about this war,
2352000	2355000	this kid needs to learn the alphabet,
2355000	2357000	and he's not going to learn it, or she,
2358000	2360000	it's a wrong place to be inclusive.
2360000	2368000	They're not going to learn it if I'm so passionate
2368000	2371000	about the goddamn struggle that's going on.
2371000	2375000	There's something about that, I guess I related that to the idea
2375000	2378000	that when you said that, you said if there's a kid somewhere
2378000	2380000	where everything's blowing up,
2380000	2382000	and they're quoting that line from Rick and Morty,
2382000	2385000	which believe me, when I write Rick and Morty
2385000	2389000	and I go to that nihilistic place,
2389000	2394000	I do it with difficulty because I feel like first world kid.
2394000	2398000	I feel like I'm part of the problem and not the solution sometimes,
2398000	2405000	but it's like kids already feel like life means nothing.
2405000	2407000	That's called being a kid,
2407000	2412000	and so if your favorite cartoon is also saying life means nothing,
2412000	2415000	I mean, but the alternative is to say life means something
2415000	2417000	and then I'd be lying.
2417000	2421000	But it's just like, so that line where Morty says that,
2421000	2423000	I remember typing that and going like,
2423000	2427000	this is like the idea that you're selling consumerism,
2427000	2429000	basically you're saying like,
2429000	2432000	life means nothing comes down to watch TV.
2432000	2435000	I was like, this feels a little shitty, but at the same time,
2435000	2438000	it just feels like he's being a good little brother
2438000	2443000	as to what she needs to hear, otherwise she's going to leave home.
2443000	2449000	But hearing that somebody whose life is being torn apart
2449000	2453000	would latch onto that line, then I go,
2453000	2456000	oh, nihilism is like the baseline.
2456000	2458000	The truth is life means nothing.
2458000	2461000	If you're wiping your ass with dollar bills
2461000	2464000	and you say life means nothing, you're being a piece of shit.
2464000	2467000	And if you're born in a bomb crater and you say life means nothing,
2467000	2471000	you're actually centering yourself and getting through shit.
2471000	2474000	It's not nihilism if you live with that.
2474000	2477000	If it's a real possibility that someone you know could die any day
2477000	2481000	just because things explode where you live and that's a normal part of life,
2481000	2484000	or if you know you're going to get shot at when you get up in the morning,
2484000	2488000	it's not nihilism to say, yeah, if anyone can die at any point in time,
2488000	2491000	let's enjoy ourselves for this 22 minutes that we have
2491000	2493000	that we know we're not getting shot at probably right now.
2493000	2495000	Like, that's not nihilistic.
2495000	2498000	That's like one of the most liberating things in the world,
2498000	2501000	is to be like, well, I know that right now when I'm watching TV,
2501000	2502000	I'm probably pretty safe.
2502000	2505000	I'm going to go out tomorrow and maybe die, but that's fucking in the morning.
2505000	2511000	Yeah, I mean, I really am drunk and I look.
2511000	2514000	The thing is, what's that?
2514000	2517000	What does she have to say?
2517000	2519000	We'll be right with you, sir.
2519000	2521000	In the meantime, enjoy your poppers.
2521000	2526000	Wait, there's poppers?
2526000	2527000	There's poppers tonight.
2527000	2528000	Son of a bitch.
2528000	2530000	There's a lot of things I do wrong.
2530000	2532000	Among them is also, I don't introduce people.
2532000	2534000	I don't tell them what's going on.
2534000	2537000	It's like, no, it's okay.
2537000	2540000	Your cookie's in the mail for caring about her.
2540000	2546000	Magenta.
2546000	2547000	You got it right.
2548000	2551000	So you guys, let's get back to the top of the interview
2551000	2553000	and what I should say.
2553000	2558000	Bypassing your worldview, you guys just came back from the Middle East
2558000	2561000	where, are you the tippy-typy, you tap the things,
2561000	2564000	and are you photographing things?
2564000	2568000	Are you guys young enough for me to ask how old you are?
2568000	2569000	29.
2569000	2572000	I'm a millennial.
2572000	2575000	Everybody under 40 is now.
2575000	2578000	No, because you hear me shitting on millennials all the time.
2578000	2580000	I sound out I'm one.
2580000	2582000	Can I ask how old you are?
2582000	2583000	27.
2583000	2584000	27 and 29.
2584000	2586000	I'm 44.
2586000	2592000	So you guys, in the interest of journalism,
2592000	2595000	you go to this place that,
2595000	2600000	if you guys were, knock on wood,
2600000	2604000	to have something horrible happen to you,
2604000	2608000	the worst people in the world would be the ones to say,
2608000	2610000	well, why'd they go over there?
2610000	2613000	And the best people in the world would only say,
2613000	2618000	oh, they went over there because they loved their job.
2618000	2622000	Nobody would say, well, good thing they went over there.
2622000	2625000	So I wanted to know from you guys,
2625000	2628000	because you're the verbal one.
2628000	2631000	You're the, not the pigeonhole, you guys,
2631000	2633000	but you're taking pictures, you're writing stuff.
2633000	2634000	We switched now.
2634000	2636000	You're both journalists.
2636000	2642000	You're providing an otherwise ignorant world with an eye into a part
2642000	2644000	that they otherwise wouldn't see.
2644000	2646000	So why are you doing that?
2646000	2650000	I mean, we went over there for the first time
2650000	2653000	because I'd read about this place called Kurdistan,
2653000	2656000	which is a region in northern Iraq that, if you read the new stories about it,
2656000	2659000	it's supposed to be really nice, really stable, really safe,
2659000	2661000	really advanced attitudes for the region towards women.
2661000	2664000	Like, one of the rules is in their parliament,
2664000	2666000	30% of the seats have to be held by women,
2666000	2669000	which is twice the representation of women in Congress in the United States,
2669000	2672000	just as a heads up.
2672000	2674000	It sounds like they're the Dan Harmon of Middle Eastern countries.
2674000	2677000	That's literally on their flag.
2677000	2679000	It's a confusing flag.
2679000	2686000	I also force myself to include a certain amount of women in everything I do.
2686000	2690000	You're welcome.
2690000	2693000	So it was one of those, like, we'd read all these reports,
2693000	2697000	but they're also, like, you never know what's true about that,
2697000	2700000	especially since, like, there's a lot of people on the far right
2700000	2702000	who have a lot of investment in Kurdistan,
2702000	2705000	like the myth of that being real and it actually being a really nice place
2705000	2708000	because it's the one era where, like, George Bush's plan worked out.
2708000	2710000	So I didn't know if that was real.
2710000	2711000	What exactly is that real quick?
2711000	2714000	Democracy in Iraq is a safe, nice place
2714000	2717000	where people get to vote and things don't explode as much.
2717000	2719000	And what are the industries that people are in?
2719000	2722000	Oil. Almost entirely oil.
2722000	2724000	It's super corrupt up there, the government,
2724000	2727000	which might not be a great thing for when I go back to say, but, like, it's...
2727000	2731000	Oh, they listen to this show. Kurdistan.
2731000	2732000	Surprising number.
2732000	2735000	All right, so I want to make sure I don't lose something, though,
2735000	2736000	because there's a point...
2736000	2740000	I want to rewind your play deck to the point
2740000	2744000	before you become the kind of person that wants to go to the Middle East
2744000	2746000	as a journalist, and I want to, like,
2746000	2750000	I want to frame forward from where you go from being someone
2750000	2753000	that hadn't considered that at all to being somebody that was like,
2753000	2754000	I'm going to go over there.
2754000	2758000	Because it's probably one of the easiest decisions in the world
2758000	2761000	for even the smartest, most liberal people to be like,
2761000	2763000	yeah, but then also I don't go over there.
2763000	2765000	Can I butt in?
2765000	2768000	It's kind of like, why would you eat meat?
2768000	2771000	Like, you should probably kill an animal
2771000	2775000	and, like, know about what's going on inside your body.
2775000	2778000	So, like, if millions of other people are living over there,
2778000	2780000	why wouldn't you go there?
2780000	2783000	Wait, I want to make sure I know the parallel you're drawing,
2783000	2785000	because it's like, why...
2785000	2789000	I would eat meat because it's the easiest thing to do.
2789000	2790000	No, it's not.
2790000	2792000	Also, can you eat the mic just a bit? Sorry.
2792000	2793000	Oh, yeah, eat the mic.
2793000	2794000	Definitely eat the mic.
2794000	2795000	You should just...
2795000	2796000	It's not me.
2796000	2799000	I think you should be willing to do whatever you're partaking in,
2799000	2801000	and if you're in the society,
2801000	2803000	buying things as you are, living as you are,
2803000	2806000	contributing to the whole world, being the way it is,
2806000	2809000	and you're fine with millions of other people dying and living through that,
2809000	2811000	like, why don't you go check it out, because they're doing it.
2811000	2812000	Right.
2812000	2817000	Yeah, I know why it's a good thing to do.
2817000	2819000	So it's not a choice, too, though.
2819000	2821000	Talking to the human beings, though,
2821000	2825000	like, where do you get to the point where you find the ability to do it?
2825000	2827000	Because I know I shouldn't be eating meat.
2827000	2829000	I think I'd be happier if I didn't eat meat,
2829000	2833000	but then Tuesday turns into Wednesday and Thursday.
2833000	2835000	You should kill an animal and try it
2835000	2837000	and just see how that makes you feel about me.
2837000	2838000	Right.
2838000	2840000	I should, I should, I should.
2840000	2842000	The question also is, what makes you brave?
2842000	2843000	Right. Exactly.
2843000	2844000	That's what I'm trying to get at.
2844000	2846000	We all feel like we have a responsibility,
2846000	2849000	but your responsibility is great in that you put yourself in danger
2849000	2851000	and come back and tell stories.
2851000	2853000	What exactly made you do that?
2853000	2855000	What makes you do that?
2855000	2858000	It's pretty fucking brave to go someplace where people are doing bombs and shit.
2858000	2860000	That's the thing, you're just like in an airport
2860000	2862000	and you're like buying your pretzel and drinking beer
2862000	2864000	and you like walk onto the runway
2864000	2866000	and you're like getting drunk in the airplane
2866000	2868000	and then you're with other humans
2868000	2869000	and there's dangerous things going around,
2869000	2874000	but like it's just you moving physically to a different part of the world.
2874000	2875000	Wait, Magenta.
2875000	2878000	Sorry, just put, always, I want to make sure people hear you.
2878000	2879000	Okay. Sorry.
2879000	2884000	The, the, but that's, this is the thing.
2884000	2892000	It's like, can you remember a version of you that didn't have that altruism
2892000	2894000	that wasn't functioning on that level?
2894000	2897000	Can you remember a version of you that was selfish and lazy
2897000	2899000	and did what was easy?
2899000	2900000	That's the only version of me.
2900000	2901000	So what changed?
2901000	2903000	Did you see something?
2903000	2904000	Did you feel something?
2904000	2906000	Did you have a dialogue with yourself?
2906000	2908000	No pressure.
2908000	2911000	But I think the reason is because like, if I could just,
2911000	2915000	I'll just babble and derail.
2915000	2917000	This is the thing.
2917000	2920000	It's like, there's all these people in the world
2920000	2924000	and then you go like, oh, there's one of those, there's one of those war journalists.
2924000	2926000	Ah, they got the vest.
2926000	2927000	They got the camera.
2927000	2931000	Ah, I just came back from Kublaka-Blaka.
2931000	2932000	Oh, what happened there?
2932000	2935000	Oh, well, there was this guy and then the wheel came off
2935000	2937000	and then there's like, but then we didn't know.
2937000	2939000	We had to get blindfolded and all this stuff.
2939000	2941000	And the rest of us are thinking deep down inside.
2941000	2943000	We're going like, well, I'll take that information
2943000	2946000	and I'll put it on my coffee mug and I'll use it to bully someone at work tomorrow
2946000	2949000	because I want them to vote for someone instead of someone.
2949000	2954000	But deep, deep, deep, deep down, although none of us are soldiers,
2954000	2960000	you guys, you guys go there figuratively and literally.
2960000	2968000	It's truly a risk and it's truly more importantly a risk that no one would even,
2968000	2969000	that's what I was saying before.
2969000	2972000	And so I'm just, okay, one more.
2972000	2979000	Let me just, the valuable thing about me nitpicking this is precisely because
2979000	2986000	if you guys aren't that different from us, if you weren't born special and brave,
2986000	2991000	there might be something, there might be something we could think.
2991000	2994000	There might be some path we could walk down where we end up like acting
2994000	2995000	instead of thinking.
2995000	2997000	So that's why I'm asking.
2997000	3002000	I mean, I can say the first war zone we ever reported from was in eastern Ukraine.
3002000	3004000	It was this town called Evdivka.
3004000	3006000	Okay, but before that, no, I'm kidding.
3006000	3008000	That's what I'm getting to, Dan.
3008000	3010000	We want to know, did you get into a fight?
3010000	3015000	What made you suddenly say,
3015000	3019000	I'm going to do a little bit more than the average person when it comes to getting facts?
3019000	3023000	I didn't like cleaning up dead animals and cockroaches in mobile homes.
3023000	3025000	There we go.
3026000	3030000	When you did it, though, did you do it as a journalist?
3030000	3033000	You're like, I'm standing over three dead bodies.
3033000	3035000	Roaches the carnage here right now.
3035000	3038000	What were you going to say, Robert?
3038000	3041000	There's two parts to that question.
3041000	3043000	One of them is that it's fun.
3043000	3048000	Up until someone gets horrifically injured, it's a lot of fun out there.
3048000	3049000	You're moving around.
3049000	3050000	Everything's going fast.
3050000	3051000	You're riding around in cool vehicles.
3051000	3052000	Everyone's really friendly.
3052000	3054000	Everything's super funny.
3054000	3059000	Anything that happens in a war zone is hilarious to everybody who's there.
3059000	3064000	At one point, we're at this area where some ISIS snipers have just been shooting,
3064000	3066000	and they've been shooting rockets back at them.
3066000	3068000	This guy is trying to load a big rocket, and he leans over,
3068000	3071000	and all the grenades fall off of his vest and down the berm.
3071000	3075000	It was like a fucking slapstick comedy moment.
3075000	3078000	He's going for all these grenades, and he sees we're filming him,
3078000	3082000	and he's like, you could tell the guy felt so bad that we caught that moment
3082000	3085000	where he looked like a badass, and then he drops his grenades on camera.
3085000	3086000	This brings up an interesting thing.
3086000	3090000	My mind is scrambling because I have two big questions off of that to ask,
3090000	3095000	which is, but I think the one I don't want to forget is,
3095000	3100000	so you're traveling with military people always.
3100000	3101000	No, no, no.
3101000	3102000	No?
3102000	3103000	They're up at the front.
3103000	3105000	You usually, so all of the war journalism,
3105000	3109000	whether it's Vice or the New York Times or the New Yorker or the Guardian or the BBC,
3109000	3112000	any time you see this report from Iraq, this report from Syria,
3112000	3117000	those guys got in a car with some local person whose primary qualification was
3117000	3121000	speaks good English and knows someone involved in the military in some way there,
3121000	3123000	and that person led them around.
3123000	3128000	They're called fixers, and it's like a little cottage economy that pops up all around.
3128000	3129000	I should probably plug.
3129000	3133000	We're raising money for a documentary about some of these guys called The Fixers.
3133000	3135000	It's on Indiegogo.
3135000	3141000	Sorry about that.
3141000	3145000	These guys, they range from literal war profiteers to where they're just like,
3145000	3148000	you're just paying them $600 to drive you to a dangerous place,
3148000	3150000	to actual good journalists.
3150000	3153000	There's this great New Yorker article that the two people we worked with
3153000	3156000	for this documentary helped put together where this guy from The New Yorker was like,
3156000	3159000	I want to talk to some, I know this battle's going to start for Mosul.
3159000	3161000	I want to talk to these Iraqi special forces.
3161000	3164000	And they were like, well, actually, there's the SWAT team of guys that were put together
3164000	3167000	because they all had someone they know killed by ISIS.
3167000	3170000	And so it's like this huge vengeance quest for all of these guys.
3170000	3172000	These are the dudes you should get embedded with.
3172000	3175000	And he did, and it's a great article on The New Yorker by Luke Mobelson.
3175000	3176000	He's there.
3176000	3179000	And it's not political.
3179000	3184000	The reason I'm asking the question, it's because you guys are,
3184000	3188000	if I had a fire person up here, is that?
3188000	3189000	A firer.
3189000	3192000	A firelady?
3192000	3199000	If I had a firefighter up here, which I never have, I'd be like, okay,
3199000	3201000	why would you ever run into a fire?
3201000	3204000	And I know I'd get some answer, like, I'd feel comfortable because I've watched enough
3204000	3208000	Scorsese movies and stuff that I, you know, if they were like, well,
3208000	3211000	my dad was a Southie, and I'd say, you know, you've got to fight fire.
3211000	3216000	You know, and I'm like, and I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
3216000	3218000	I'm not trivializing it or undercutting it.
3218000	3223000	I'm saying, like, I can map that in my universe the same way that in pre-Columbian
3223000	3228000	Earth, we could go, here there's dragons.
3228000	3234000	What, I've always been fascinated with this archetype where you guys,
3234000	3238000	like, you're, you're going and pointing and clicking and you're,
3238000	3242000	and you're writing about, and you're interviewing in these places that all
3242000	3247000	we know about them and all we seem to continue to know about them is that
3247000	3250000	they're a mess and that, and that there be dragons.
3250000	3256000	And so I, I, I, I kind of like, I don't want you to compromise your integrity.
3256000	3261000	If, if you feel like it makes you sound like a douchebag, but if you were to say
3261000	3266000	to me, you know what, at the end of the day, it's just the perfect slot.
3266000	3270000	Like, I feel like it's just enough trouble and just low enough risk.
3270000	3273000	Or if you put it up, I'd be like, okay, I got it. I got it.
3273000	3274000	It's not that I think.
3274000	3278000	Okay. So this is where I think you're, and I think we're like 99% of people
3278000	3280000	who haven't been to a place like that.
3280000	3282000	And I think probably most people who go there as part of the military,
3282000	3285000	because you only see a very limited chunk of these countries when you're doing.
3285000	3288000	You see through the eyes of, of some political.
3288000	3291000	Exactly. And you're in armored, like even in a place like Iraq,
3291000	3294000	most of the country is perfectly nice.
3294000	3296000	Like geographically, most of the country is nice.
3296000	3301000	Iraqis are the kindest people to guests that you will ever meet in the world.
3301000	3303000	They will, there were times when we would be, we would be in Mosul.
3303000	3306000	So we're in the most dangerous city on earth probably.
3306000	3308000	Like there's all night you're hearing the sounds of gunfire.
3308000	3313000	There's fucking like vehicle based IEDs blowing up and like sending mushroom clouds
3313000	3315000	up into the sky a mile away.
3315000	3318000	And you, you drive up to where like just some dudes are bunked down
3318000	3321000	and their job is to pull people out of like collapsed buildings.
3321000	3323000	They got blown up in airstrikes every day.
3323000	3325000	And you're like, can we crash here tonight?
3325000	3327000	And they're like, of course you're staying here tonight.
3327000	3329000	We're going to cook you dinner. Like we've got all this tea on.
3329000	3330000	Like we're getting our tobacco up.
3330000	3332000	Let's, let's talk and hang out all night.
3332000	3334000	Like you guys will be as safe here as you are anywhere.
3334000	3338000	Like if you spend more than like 20 minutes talking to anyone in their house in Iraq,
3338000	3340000	they're going to invite you to stay the night.
3340000	3341000	They're going to invite you to cook food for you.
3341000	3343000	They're going to put out tea for you.
3343000	3347000	Like you have to, you have to turn people down from giving you hospitality.
3347000	3351000	Like we would be talking to people who had family members killed in American airstrikes
3351000	3354000	and with a lot of reasons to be angry at the US and they would tell it to you.
3354000	3356000	They'd be like, you know, I have issues with your government,
3356000	3358000	but I know that's just your politicians.
3358000	3360000	You're a guest here in my home and I'm going to take the best care of you
3360000	3361000	that you've ever had taken of you.
3361000	3366000	Like it's, you don't feel like when people are shooting at you during those limited chunks of time,
3366000	3369000	they generally are pretty limited temporally.
3369000	3373000	They're in enough supply for me to the extent that it would ever happen.
3373000	3375000	A little would go a long way.
3375000	3379000	That part, that part's like there's, there's fear in that part,
3379000	3381000	but the rest of the time you're not actively terrified.
3381000	3382000	I'm sorry.
3382000	3387000	When we mentioned homelessness one night after we thought we were finished filming the documentary,
3387000	3390000	I.R., the guy that we're, one of the guys we're doing it on,
3390000	3393000	he didn't understand the concept of homelessness.
3393000	3394000	Right.
3394000	3395000	And that just blew my mind.
3395000	3400000	Yeah, we're talking with all these guys whose job again is to pull people out of like burning buildings and whatnot.
3400000	3403000	And like none of these guys have been paid in two and a half years
3403000	3406000	because they're all civil employees of the city that got taken over by ISIS.
3406000	3409000	So they spent two and a half years living under ISIS control.
3409000	3412000	The city got liberated and now they're doing the same job for the Iraqi government,
3412000	3416000	but they're still not getting paid because the government hasn't reactivated their paychecks.
3416000	3419000	And we get onto the subject of homelessness in Los Angeles.
3419000	3420000	And he's like, wait, go back.
3420000	3421000	What do you mean homeless people?
3421000	3422000	What do you mean homeless people?
3422000	3423000	Like they have less home?
3423000	3424000	Yeah.
3424000	3425000	You had to explain it.
3425000	3426000	We're their families.
3426000	3429000	I mean, now that you say that, that is blowing my mind.
3429000	3434000	It also makes sense because you're like, wait, where else but a totally entrenched,
3434000	3440000	capitalistic first world empire would you, would you go, oh, no home.
3440000	3443000	What did he do wrong?
3443000	3445000	All right.
3445000	3451000	But is that God, I don't mean to keep nagging you about this, but is that why is that?
3451000	3452000	Is it here?
3452000	3453000	Here.
3453000	3454000	Here.
3454000	3455000	Let me pitch you something.
3455000	3456000	Say yes or no.
3456000	3462000	It's you, you, you do it because you get the satisfaction of knowing that you've,
3462000	3470000	you've taken the, the, the more Keanu pill from the matrix than the Pantiliano's pill.
3470000	3472000	I can't remember which color is which, but I don't know.
3472000	3473000	I don't even know.
3473000	3474000	I know one hates women.
3474000	3475000	Who is Pantiliano's?
3475000	3476000	Well, that's the thing.
3476000	3480000	Like you're out there and there's sand in your head and you're like, like, I'm like,
3480000	3483000	what about the matrix?
3483000	3484000	Is that part of it?
3484000	3487720	Is it, is it, is it like, like, kind of like, man, I live in fucking reality, man.
3487720	3493440	Like you're like a weird drone, you know, a normal person and like, are you like a weird
3493440	3494440	drone?
3494440	3495440	Yes.
3495440	3499000	No, me, I'm saying, I'm saying he is, is that part of the satisfaction of being like, yeah,
3499000	3502040	I want to breathe free air, i.e. real air.
3502040	3507280	I don't want to, I don't want to be like the actor Joe Pantiliano, who you should really
3507280	3513200	Google and appreciate, in the matrix, he's the Judas character who is like, give me the
3513200	3517680	steak, give me the, you know, not a new myth, but it was modernized.
3517680	3519400	So I use that to connect with the kids.
3519400	3522680	Also, we kind of think that we're good at adventure.
3522680	3524720	And so maybe we have a little bit of ego there.
3524720	3528800	Like we think that we can get a little bit deeper than the journalists next to us.
3528800	3529800	And so that's kind of a fun challenge.
3529800	3530800	Which is a competitive aspect.
3530800	3536200	I want to ask that really difficult question that I don't think I would ever, I have the
3536200	3540440	balls to ask a soldier because I feel like I would be, I would actually almost be somehow
3540440	3541840	spiritually offensive.
3541840	3553520	No, but do you guys feel like you're like, karmically, like, no, like, like, like, like,
3553520	3557600	you get like, like, like you got a little bubble around you, like you're a, you're a,
3557600	3562040	you're a hobbit and not an elf, like, like, no, we bought, we bought medical kits, like,
3562040	3564920	like, I'll just, I'll just kinda, you know, I'm more important.
3564920	3570280	Like, not more important, but more like detached, like, like, like, like when R2 and C3 PR are
3570280	3575520	walking through the spaceship in the beginning of the original Star Wars, you should look
3575520	3580600	at that up to its, I've seen the original Star Wars, I don't know what to believe anymore.
3580600	3583720	Uh, but there, but it's like, no, no one shoots a droid.
3583720	3584920	Why would you?
3584920	3587920	You know, the answer is because one of them holds the fucking hope.
3587920	3593800	Is that, is that like part of the journalist, like, like, like, like fetish, maybe?
3593800	3594800	No.
3594800	3600800	I don't, like, for me, it's, uh, like I, like I've always liked to travel and stuff
3600800	3605480	and I like that feeling of like getting an idea of how like tiny you are.
3605480	3609560	And it's also like extreme experiences are interesting and there's nothing more extreme
3609560	3610560	than that experience.
3610560	3612400	There's nothing more extreme than like being in it.
3612400	3615960	Like it looks like, like Mosul right now looks like you see these movies, like World
3615960	3620240	War II movies of Stalingrad and stuff, like, uh, what was the, the, the, the one about the,
3620240	3621240	the sniper in there?
3621240	3622240	I don't know.
3622240	3623240	Enemy at the gates.
3623240	3624240	Enemy at the gates.
3624240	3625240	Like it looks like that.
3625240	3628280	So you're seeing all this stuff that like you never would have imagined seeing with
3628280	3631960	your own eyes and it's so shocking and weird and fascinating.
3631960	3635480	And as like a journalist, like my whole, the whole thing that motivates me is talking to
3635480	3637840	people with more interesting stories than me.
3637840	3642160	And so that kind of place, like you, any single person you just walk up to and start talking
3642240	3644320	to, they have experiences you can't imagine.
3644320	3646320	They've seen things that I can't even comprehend.
3646320	3649120	They have, they have a thousand experiences to tell me.
3649120	3652840	So like normally working, like when I'm at the Republican National Convention or the
3652840	3656960	Democratic Convention, like doing, like you walk up to people and most people don't have
3656960	3661280	anything interesting to say and the people that do have like two interesting sentences,
3661280	3664800	like you go to a place like that, everybody you talk to has a thousand fascinating things
3664800	3665800	to say.
3665800	3669320	And I would imagine, I don't want to take, but it's, it's the same way with pictures
3669320	3670320	there too.
3670320	3671320	Like anywhere you turn.
3671440	3673720	I was absolutely going to go there.
3673760	3676080	Oh, here's a, yeah, here's a concrete example.
3676240	3677400	You're holding up a can.
3677400	3678840	You guys showed me these cans.
3679320	3683880	This is just in the department of if you go far enough in the world, there's shit you
3683880	3687360	won't believe, which is they sell cans of liquor.
3687360	3688440	This is canned whiskey.
3688480	3690440	It's not, it's not a mixed drink.
3690480	3693240	Like it's not, it's not a whiskey soda.
3693320	3695640	It's not like a little bit of whiskey poured into it.
3695640	3699360	This is straight whiskey and there's, it's around for sips if people want sips.
3699960	3701640	It's not going to push it.
3703320	3707640	There is a can back at the bar that should be open now if people want to take little
3707640	3709280	bits of it and we can pass this around.
3709520	3710400	It's God awful.
3710960	3712920	I'm not, there's, there's no sugarcoating this.
3712920	3714160	It's the worst thing you drink.
3714200	3715240	We have a hand raised.
3715240	3718080	I'll reward your politeness by giving you the floor.
3719920	3721440	Oh, wait, what?
3721560	3723040	Oh, oh, you just went liquor.
3723280	3723880	Jesus.
3724200	3726520	And you use the worst metaphor ever.
3727160	3733040	And not that there are soldiers, but like that, you know, Willie Roberts, he found a
3733040	3734800	grenade in Los Feliz.
3734920	3735400	What?
3735440	3737200	He just found a grenade somewhere.
3737200	3739120	The police came and blew it up.
3739240	3739960	Oh, nice.
3739960	3740320	All right.
3740320	3741040	Next episode.
3741280	3741560	Yeah.
3741560	3742920	You would have, you would have loved it.
3744160	3751480	I wanted to, because we, because magenta year, uh, you look for through a camera
3751480	3753560	while you're there, I'm not pigeonholing you.
3753560	3758360	Cause you said backstage, like, well, you'll like to do the, you want to do the typing
3758360	3764960	too, but, um, or you guys overlap or the talking, the, the, the, okay.
3765080	3775640	But the I, when you're abroad and you're covering war, uh, what I like, you, you
3775640	3782240	be the judge of whether or not it's like, uh, should we, do you want to talk about
3782240	3788400	it or do you want to show some of the stuff, uh, that you guys brought at what, while
3788400	3789280	you talk about it?
3789280	3790800	Is that like a better way to do it?
3791160	3793200	You can do that at some point, any, any point you want.
3793240	3797280	Cause I think, yeah, it'd probably be an easy thing in that for the audio podcast
3797280	3801680	listeners, if we're, let's just look at some stuff and let's just make an edit
3801680	3804720	point here and say, Hey, $5 a month.
3805000	3811160	Oh, for the, for the podcast, we should just put in like screaming, just like
3811160	3814120	screeching and just a solid me undies ad.
3814160	3814680	Yeah.
3815000	3816640	Here's a, here's a free me undies ad.
3816640	3824440	I want to give, I shit my pants this morning because of a weekend of drinking
3824440	3830000	nothing but soylent because my girlfriend is writing.
3830000	3832160	So she's not around to order pizza with.
3832760	3839560	Uh, I, I was so unwilling to throw my me undies away.
3840560	3842240	I watched them in the sink.
3845240	3845960	Which sink?
3846000	3848120	That was not an ad for soylent.
3850440	3852640	And he didn't pay for it.
3852680	3854880	I just love me undies that much.
3854920	3856000	I don't want to throw them away.
3856040	3856320	All right.
3856560	3857440	Well, that's convinced me.
3857440	3859040	How do I get these underpants?
3859520	3863760	I'll get, uh, you, you, yeah, go to, not those underpants, right.
3864840	3865680	I'm telling you there.
3865680	3867960	It's like, it's, it's, it's incredible.
3868000	3869240	You can put them on Kickstarter.
3869680	3872840	I mean, but that's why, and then I go like, well, so deep, but then
3872840	3874280	why would I go to Iraq?
3874320	3875600	They don't have me undies.
3875800	3877720	I mean, they, they might have them there.
3877720	3881080	Well, if we, if we, if we bring freedom to them, of course.
3881920	3885840	What I did get over there was a pair, a great pair of Hugo bass underwear.
3886000	3890360	But did they have micro modal of fabric that's three times softer than cotton?
3890640	3891520	Nice.
3895160	3897240	I, is that a, is that a synthetic fiber?
3897400	3898320	Oh yeah.
3898320	3899520	That's made in LA.
3899520	3903040	I think you don't want to wear synthetic fibers in the work because when
3903040	3905640	things light on fire around you, they can melt to your skin.
3905680	3908640	Like if you get hit by an incendiary natural fiber.
3908960	3911280	What's the verdict on the whiskey so far?
3912840	3913160	It's good.
3913200	3913560	All right.
3913560	3915560	I can't, I can't believe y'all are saying that.
3915560	3918080	Do you want the actual, this is the actual whiskey.
3921080	3921600	Oh man.
3923120	3923520	All right.
3923520	3927560	So no, go ahead and, uh, let's put a, we'll put a little
3927720	3929200	marker somewhere around here.
3929320	3931400	If you're, it's pretty funny.
3931680	3932080	Okay.
3932120	3935240	And we're going to, we're going to look at some stuff that only you guys are
3935240	3936400	looking at cause you're here.
3937000	3938200	Uh, we'll describe it to you though.
3940480	3941320	There's a feminist.
3941320	3941480	Yeah.
3941480	3944400	Which one start with the mannequin challenge.
3944440	3944640	Yeah.
3944640	3947920	So this is, so I are, went to these guys and was like, I want to do this.
3947920	3950840	There's this thing called the mannequin challenge guys who are in an active war
3950840	3951240	zone.
3951560	3952960	I want you to do this for me.
3953200	3956760	And they were like, no, so you had the balls to say to them,
3957600	3959000	Hey, could you point for me?
3959000	3960960	And yeah.
3960960	3964200	Does this sort of thing happen a lot as like people dabbing when
3964200	3965480	grenades are going through the air?
3966120	3966440	No.
3966800	3969000	Ice bucket challenge.
3969800	3973040	So he tells him to do this and they say no, but part of his job, like the
3973040	3975960	reason he's a good fixer, the reason he can get journalist places is that he
3975960	3979800	just, he meets a lot of officers and like captains, colonels, generals, and
3979800	3980880	you get their phone numbers.
3980880	3983880	Like it's the Iraqi military is not like the U S military.
3984200	3986640	Like it's all about who, you know, you bring people cigarettes and they're
3986640	3987160	your buddy.
3987480	3990680	So he calls their captain up and he says, I want you to make them do this.
3990760	3993360	And their captain called them and said, do this.
3993520	3994360	And then they had to do it.
3994520	3996720	And you can tell how pissed they are in the video.
3997680	3998960	And is it going to fuck things up?
3998960	4002200	Cause I don't think Joel's going to be able to contain himself.
4003240	4006520	You're what he's going to start making funny riffs during the.
4006520	4007000	That's fine.
4007560	4010480	No, we all, you all know how this, you all know how the mannequin challenge
4010480	4010920	goes.
4040480	4047480	Smoked in the air, been streaking, they lose it when the DJ drops the knee in the mood.
4047480	4053480	Getting so cold I'm not thinkin', what in the world was I thinkin'?
4053480	4056480	Today, no one needs to be mad.
4056480	4058480	Damn.
4061480	4063480	Rappers ain't shit.
4063480	4065480	Rappers are not shit.
4065480	4069480	Because if you have guns in your video and you're trying to act hard and shit, you're
4069480	4071480	just fuckin' hard.
4071480	4073480	This isn't as hard as it fucking is.
4073480	4075480	I think he won the mannequin challenge.
4075480	4077480	Yeah, yeah.
4077480	4081480	But it's weird to think about because when we think of soldiers, we think of army men,
4081480	4085480	we think of World War II, and we think of guys in camouflage holding guns because they're
4085480	4088480	detached from what's going on at home.
4088480	4092480	And what's going on at home is television and Bart Simpson and donuts, and that's what
4092480	4094480	they're fighting for and all this stuff.
4094480	4101480	So to be in a third world country and be holding an assault rifle, and your orders are to kill
4101480	4106480	another human being with fast flying pieces of metal that are gonna be projected from
4106480	4112480	your gun, but to have a phone in your pocket connected to Donald Trump's tweets and stranger
4112480	4114480	things and gossip.
4114480	4119480	I don't know, and to have a journalist telling you, hey, do you know what the mannequin challenge
4119480	4120480	is?
4120480	4121480	Oh, we didn't do that.
4121480	4122480	Oh yeah, I know what that is.
4122480	4123480	I'll do that.
4123480	4127480	Blowing the head off of someone if they do the wrong thing like appear in front of me.
4127480	4131480	I want to clarify, that was filmed by I.R., who's our fixer.
4131480	4132480	We had nothing to do with that.
4132480	4135480	That was his purely, he was motivated to do that when he was up there.
4135480	4136480	Wait, so you weren't there?
4136480	4137480	I was not there at that point.
4137480	4138480	Okay.
4138480	4139480	No, that was in October.
4139480	4140480	So he's like, hey, should I do the mannequin challenge?
4140480	4142480	And you're like, you don't have to do that for me.
4142480	4143480	And he's like, no, it'll be great.
4143480	4144480	Oh, he did that for him.
4144480	4146480	That was all for I.R.
4146480	4149480	How do you get, how do you get people to trust you?
4149480	4152480	How do you get people to take you where you need to go to see things?
4152480	4154480	I mean, it's most about meeting good people.
4154480	4158480	So before we went over there, I got the numbers and names of a bunch of different fixers who
4158480	4160480	are all people who said they could do this for us.
4160480	4164480	And then I found people who they were connected to on Twitter, who had like the guy that I
4164480	4169480	wound up reaching out to runs a company that helps recover people who have been kidnapped
4169480	4170480	and ransomed.
4170480	4174480	So this guy was a friend of the guy that I was going to work with, was like a Twitter
4174480	4175480	buddy of the guy I was going to work with.
4175480	4177480	And I was like, hey, did you work with this guy in Iraq?
4177480	4178480	And he said, yes.
4178480	4180480	So this guy has like clear credentials.
4180480	4181480	He knows what he's doing.
4181480	4182480	He's got a record.
4182480	4183480	I say, can I trust this guy?
4183480	4184480	And he says, yes.
4184480	4186480	I would say you can trust him with your life.
4186480	4189480	Do people like, do they know you're liberal?
4189480	4192480	Do they care that their story is going to get told a certain way?
4192480	4195480	I have the first time we met.
4195480	4196480	I'm sorry.
4196480	4198480	I think they're hyper aware around journalists.
4198480	4200480	Okay, they don't want this kind of bullshit.
4200480	4202480	So you have to really sift through it.
4202480	4203480	And how do you do that?
4203480	4206480	How do you get to like, we want to know what's really going on?
4206480	4209480	Don't tell about the Japanese guy that was there for a week.
4209480	4210480	Yeah.
4210480	4212480	So this sets up some of the other footage.
4212480	4215480	And this kind of dovetails into the topic of fake news.
4215480	4220480	So we're there one morning, and we drive into West Mosul,
4220480	4223480	which is the part of the city that's still a big chunk of its held by ISIS.
4223480	4226480	And we get up to the front, and our fixers are with us like,
4226480	4228480	there's going to be a caravan with a bunch of other journalists
4228480	4230480	and a bunch of Iraqi army guys.
4230480	4232480	We need to ride with them up to the front,
4232480	4234480	but we want to escape from them as soon as we can
4234480	4236480	so we can run around without handlers and whatnot
4236480	4238480	so we can actually get a good story.
4238480	4239480	Seems like a good idea.
4239480	4240480	Yeah.
4240480	4242480	You don't want to be where all the other people with cameras are.
4242480	4244480	But we wound up getting corralled into this van
4244480	4246480	and wind up with these guys anyway,
4246480	4247480	and they take us to a section of the front line,
4247480	4248480	and we're there five minutes,
4248480	4250480	and there's one or two sniper shots from ISIS,
4250480	4252480	and they just start firing.
4252480	4254480	The Iraqi army just starts firing all of the RPGs
4254480	4257480	and these big weapons called SPG-9s
4257480	4258480	and just shooting everything off.
4258480	4259480	You called my name.
4259480	4260480	You were talking to me.
4260480	4263480	I was walking through this part that you're supposed to run through,
4263480	4265480	but he said my name, so I turned around,
4265480	4267480	and I forgot that I'm not supposed to like,
4267480	4268480	it's not a good place to stand.
4268480	4271480	So I was there for too long, so someone started shooting.
4271480	4272480	But there was a berm above us.
4272480	4274480	Nobody could hit us, which is the point.
4274480	4276480	So this is the point, is that we were never in,
4276480	4278480	it was not a real firefight.
4278480	4280480	Like, we watched this thing happen,
4280480	4281480	and it's incredibly, it looks like a movie,
4281480	4283480	it feels like an actual fight,
4283480	4284480	and then after it gets done,
4284480	4286480	and all of these, there's like 20 people filming it,
4286480	4288480	our fixers turn to us and they're like,
4288480	4290480	you know that was mostly bullshit, right?
4290480	4293480	Like, every morning they lead journalists right here,
4293480	4295480	and there's always that, that always happens.
4295480	4298480	There's like a thousand outgoing shots for every one of them coming.
4298480	4303480	But you guys know, that takes me back to this all important point.
4303480	4310480	It's like, you guys do perceive the,
4310480	4313480	like, do you make peace with the idea,
4313480	4318480	like I do when I fly on an airplane, period?
4318480	4323480	Because that's too much for me to be out of that much control
4323480	4326480	and to have these savages called flight attendants,
4326480	4330480	like in charge of my destiny.
4330480	4336480	Like, I need to decide before I get on the plane,
4336480	4340480	I might die, blah, blah, blah, I hope not to.
4340480	4343480	You could argue I expect not to.
4343480	4346480	I will complain if I start dying.
4346480	4348480	I will go to my grave dying.
4348480	4351480	If I did what you do, I can't do that.
4351480	4355480	I can't be like, oh, look at that landmine go off.
4355480	4359480	Wait, there's one under me? I've had it.
4359480	4363480	But if I get on a United Airline and a cop starts tasing me
4363480	4367480	because their Christmas discount isn't working or whatever the fuck,
4367480	4370480	I can be like, this is bullshit.
4370480	4373480	It might not work, but at least I have that recourse.
4373480	4375480	That is a blanket we wrap around ourselves.
4375480	4377480	We feel like complaining.
4377480	4381480	We're never more than one complaint away from our mommy grabbing us
4381480	4383480	and going, it's okay.
4383480	4385480	And that's why I continue to eat meat.
4385480	4389480	Because to continue to do what you did before
4389480	4393480	and to only cry out and to only do things when something's wrong,
4393480	4396480	that's just primatology.
4396480	4400480	And that's why I keep harping on that because I truly do wish,
4400480	4403480	because I want to know.
4403480	4406480	The biggest thing in my mind is, I want to know,
4406480	4409480	when you guys look at people like me, do you go,
4409480	4412480	you fucking gross piece of shit.
4412480	4414480	Or are you like, that's the customer.
4414480	4417480	Well, let's go up, take some more pictures of landmines for them.
4417480	4420480	No, okay, so here's what you're getting at there,
4420480	4423480	is what makes something really scary is not having any control.
4423480	4426480	They did a series of studies on fighter pilots in Vietnam
4426480	4428480	back during that whole war thing,
4428480	4431480	and they found out that most of these fighters would have,
4431480	4433480	the actual pilot, and then there's the navigator.
4433480	4435480	And so in the weeks leading up to the mission,
4435480	4437480	the navigator who was planning the mission,
4437480	4439480	who was deciding where they were going to go
4439480	4442480	and exactly what was going to happen, had very low stress levels.
4442480	4444480	And the fighter pilot's stress levels spiked
4444480	4446480	because they had no control over anything.
4446480	4449480	And then during the actual mission, when they're actually flying,
4449480	4451480	the fighter pilots have zero stress,
4451480	4453480	but the navigator's stress spikes
4453480	4455480	because you have no control over that plane.
4455480	4458480	That's what makes things scary is the lack of control.
4458480	4461480	So when you're in a plane at 30,000, 40,000 feet,
4461480	4463480	however the fuck high planes go,
4463480	4466480	I don't have any more ability to affect that than you do.
4466480	4469480	But when I'm in Mosul and somebody might shoot at me,
4469480	4473480	I have the ability to run and hide behind a heavy wall
4473480	4476480	or find the biggest Iraqi guy in a body armor and hide behind the wall.
4476480	4478480	That's the whole problem, though.
4478480	4482480	That's the thing, when I go on the Batman ride at Six Flags...
4482480	4486480	Completely perfect parallel.
4486480	4490480	It's the only parallel I have.
4490480	4496480	When they lower a big fucking 90s or more modern grate over you,
4496480	4498480	like eating meat, by the way,
4498480	4504480	when you have society's fucking permission to be a piece of garbage,
4504480	4506480	when you're just like, clank,
4506480	4510480	you're like, it's not my fault if anyone gets decapitated on this ride.
4510480	4513480	I'm in a Batman harness.
4513480	4514480	I can't do shit.
4514480	4517480	Scariest roller coaster I ever went on,
4517480	4520480	the world's oldest roller coaster is like Six Flags.
4520480	4522480	It's like The Eagle.
4522480	4527480	They put you in a wagon and put a jump rope across your lap.
4527480	4532480	I am now at fault if everyone dies, including myself.
4532480	4534480	I'm going to fail.
4534480	4538480	That to me is, you're saying, you sound like you'd be like,
4538480	4542480	whoof, hate being in that Batman harness, not enough control.
4542480	4544480	I'm like, what are you talking about?
4544480	4546480	Give me a sedative.
4546480	4548480	Would you rather kill yourself or someone else kill you?
4548480	4550480	Would I rather kill myself or have someone else kill me?
4550480	4552480	Okay, I love you.
4552480	4556480	Okay.
4556480	4560480	And by the way, I also love our audience who tweeted.
4560480	4563480	I said, we have war journalists fresh back from the Middle East,
4563480	4569480	and there's a fucking handful of shit that would make Chomsky fun for it.
4569480	4571480	I want to get to them, but I also want to see photos.
4571480	4573480	I want to ask, okay.
4573480	4575480	Would I rather kill myself or be killed?
4575480	4577480	I'd rather kill myself.
4577480	4579480	I'd rather kill myself.
4579480	4580480	Thank you.
4580480	4583480	Thank you.
4583480	4589480	But here's the thing.
4589480	4591480	I think this is really important.
4591480	4597480	That's an easy question to answer because it's like a credit card bill
4597480	4599480	that you buy control.
4599480	4608480	If you asked me, you have to die at 12 a.m.,
4608480	4612480	is it going to be by your own hand or by a stranger?
4612480	4615480	My answer changed because when you say,
4615480	4617480	would you rather kill yourself or be killed,
4617480	4620480	all I hear is control versus lack of control.
4620480	4622480	Instead of Batman versus old roller coaster,
4622480	4624480	because that doesn't make sense.
4624480	4626480	You should want the old roller coaster, not Batman.
4626480	4630480	I want to kill myself because then I get to just be like,
4630480	4632480	okay, well, maybe today, maybe tomorrow,
4632480	4634480	I'll gladly pay you for a hamburger.
4634480	4638480	That's what we're all doing.
4638480	4641480	We're kind of like going, how are you doing, Joel?
4641480	4643480	I have an idea.
4643480	4647480	I was just going to say about being in situations where it's dangerous
4647480	4650480	and there's tension and a threat.
4650480	4652480	A lot of it is gradual.
4652480	4654480	You move into it slowly,
4654480	4658480	and you could say your job is scary and there's a lot of tension,
4658480	4661480	there's a lot of money getting thrown around,
4661480	4663480	and you have to make a show.
4663480	4665480	For a lot of people, that would be very daunting,
4665480	4667480	and you gradually moved into it.
4667480	4669480	I think that's one piece of this,
4669480	4674480	is just that you slowly get into more and more dramatic situations.
4674480	4679480	You always feel like you may have leverage in your pocket.
4679480	4682480	I felt like when I was working on Community,
4682480	4684480	I was sitting on a network sitcom,
4684480	4687480	and I'm surrounded by people who are fucking pros.
4687480	4692480	I got fired from basic cable.
4692480	4694480	I wasn't even able to hold myself there.
4694480	4696480	I'm like, these people are diplomats.
4696480	4699480	I'm on King's Landing and I'm a fucking wildling.
4699480	4701480	Do you guys know what that means?
4701480	4704480	No, you were out fucking doing important shit.
4704480	4707480	Game of Thrones is important shit, Dan.
4707480	4711480	Let's not downplay the importance of that.
4711480	4714480	I distinctly recall, because I was like,
4714480	4716480	well, I've always been a piece of shit
4716480	4718480	that loves having attention paid to me,
4718480	4722480	and I did notice that the people I was the most afraid of,
4722480	4724480	because of their business acumen,
4724480	4727480	because of their diplomacy, because of their savvy,
4727480	4731480	when the spotlight would hit me, they would shrink away.
4731480	4735480	They would be like, don't talk about that.
4735480	4737480	No, I don't want to do an interview with them.
4738480	4741480	And I'd be like, oh, so if I'm Colonel Sanders,
4741480	4744480	it's my fried chicken.
4744480	4747480	Does that make sense?
4747480	4749480	So that's an example.
4749480	4752480	I could picture a firefighter even going like,
4752480	4756480	okay, so, oh, you're scared about the idea
4756480	4758480	of running into a burning building,
4758480	4761480	because it's mystical to you.
4761480	4764480	I found something that I've demystified
4764480	4766480	and I can continue to explore.
4766480	4770480	That person's not going to go back and go,
4770480	4772480	but what about my parcheesi skills?
4772480	4774480	That person's going to continue to go,
4774480	4777480	like, I want to grow in that direction.
4777480	4779480	I want to...
4779480	4783480	That's helping me not hate myself
4783480	4785480	for living on the same earth as you.
4785480	4787480	What are you talking?
4787480	4789480	Because I'm worried I'm not a good person,
4789480	4791480	but now I realize nothing matters.
4791480	4793480	But being a good person has nothing to do
4793480	4795480	with doing stuff that's dangerous.
4795480	4798480	You can see that because you traipse over
4798480	4800480	the military zones.
4800480	4801480	Who's the thing?
4801480	4803480	I live in the Matrix.
4803480	4804480	I love my stake.
4804480	4806480	We all live in the same city here.
4806480	4807480	The people...
4807480	4809480	I get that sometimes around our friends and everything.
4809480	4810480	No, you live on earth.
4810480	4811480	You live in reality.
4811480	4812480	You're a child of God.
4812480	4816480	I'm a fat, fucking horrible agent of compromise.
4816480	4818480	And you know that.
4818480	4822480	And the fact that you won't admit it makes me hate you.
4822480	4824480	No, there's nothing more without compromise.
4824480	4825480	Kill me.
4825480	4826480	We're all just stabbing each other.
4826480	4829480	Kill me so I don't have to kill myself.
4829480	4832480	I know you know people with guns.
4832480	4835480	I don't have the balls to get my own...
4835480	4837480	Have you not pissed yourself by the way?
4837480	4840480	My 10-day waiting period is seven months.
4840480	4842480	All right.
4842480	4843480	I mean, I can...
4843480	4845480	Let's roll some of that beautiful bean footage.
4845480	4846480	No, I don't...
4846480	4847480	Magenta.
4847480	4848480	Magenta.
4848480	4851480	Do we have stuff up here that you've photographed?
4851480	4852480	Okay.
4852480	4854480	Let's look at...
4854480	4856480	I want to look at war photography.
4856480	4857480	Yeah, that's what I was starting to walk...
4857480	4858480	If you want to...
4858480	4859480	Do you want someone getting shot?
4859480	4860480	Do you want someone shooting?
4860480	4861480	No, no.
4861480	4863480	Well, I mean, why am I saying no?
4863480	4864480	I mean, what?
4864480	4868480	No, I want the part of war where everyone high-fives.
4868480	4870480	Do you want to do the screening with us in Iraq?
4870480	4871480	You can do a Harmon town in Erbil.
4871480	4873480	No, I don't want to ever do anything.
4873480	4874480	We'll keep you safe.
4874480	4875480	It's a nice safe place.
4875480	4876480	We'll keep you safe.
4876480	4877480	This is part of the thing.
4877480	4878480	That would be a really nice hotel.
4878480	4879480	Let's do it.
4879480	4880480	The hotel's really nice.
4880480	4881480	It's safer city than L.A.
4881480	4883480	Should we go do a Harmon town in the Middle East somewhere?
4883480	4884480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
4884480	4887480	I'm telling you, if you want to go...
4887480	4892480	We could talk about this later if you're serious, but if you want to do a Harmon town in Erbil,
4892480	4894480	it is a safer city than Los Angeles.
4894480	4899480	What if we do a Harmon town there and it's 9-11?
4899480	4900480	They didn't do 9-11.
4900480	4901480	I know.
4901480	4902480	I'm just saying.
4902480	4903480	Wouldn't it be weird?
4903480	4904480	Someone's like, it's 9-11.
4904480	4907480	It'd be fun.
4907480	4909480	Let's just look at some pictures.
4909480	4917480	And you tell me, Magenta, because the average person is like, well, I don't even understand
4917480	4920480	any photographer.
4920480	4921480	And I admire all of them.
4921480	4925480	They look through a lens and they go, oh, that's a good picture, as opposed to everything
4925480	4928480	else I look at.
4928480	4933480	Can you shed any verbal light on what it is you're supposed to do when you want to take
4933480	4934480	pictures of shit?
4934480	4936480	Shed that verbal light, yo.
4936480	4941480	What photography is very different, which is why I have a chance, because I'm a horrible
4941480	4942480	photographer.
4942480	4943480	I'm not a photographer.
4943480	4946480	I'm just trying this new thing out that I like.
4946480	4950480	And so you can't have as much control as you want to have, which would be awkward for you,
4950480	4951480	I guess.
4951480	4958480	Oh, is that like if I was like, oh, I prefer to write in a tank of water hanging upside
4958480	4959480	down.
4959480	4961480	What are the shows that they do on screen?
4961480	4965480	Yeah, because then if my script is like, whoa, that's good for a guy hanging upside down
4965480	4966480	in a tank of water.
4966480	4967480	Can't plan it.
4967480	4968480	So you kind of have to just be good at adapting.
4968480	4969480	It's like Christian Rock.
4969480	4970480	You can't plan Christian Rock?
4970480	4973480	Oh, you see, if you're bad at rock, you're still Christian.
4973480	4980480	It's like it doesn't have to be Van Halen, you love Christ.
4980480	4984480	If you're photographing Iraq, you're like, whoa, there was a guy shooting at me.
4984480	4985480	Yeah.
4985480	4986480	Or a lady.
4986480	4987480	It's a buffer.
4987480	4989480	It's a great place to practice.
4989480	4994640	No, but I'm sorry, I got distracted by my fucking dumb shit.
4994640	4999640	But there is a little bit of truth to that, in that you're like, well, I don't want to
4999640	5003500	be Ansel Adams because I don't know how to deal with that internal.
5003500	5008320	My therapist says run on the engine, not the pistons.
5008320	5015320	So when you're photographing in the field, are you like, can you just talk, do you discriminate?
5015320	5017280	Are you looking, that's a good picture.
5017280	5018280	That's a bad picture.
5018280	5022840	Or are you like, I'll figure it out later, so probably somewhere in between, but.
5022840	5028200	Just do whatever I feel like doing, and he'll be like, look that way, and then I just start
5028200	5029200	doing that.
5029200	5032320	And it's like, and look that way is based on.
5032320	5035320	Well, some of it's like we're filming a documentary out there.
5035320	5038800	So like some of it's like, oh, we got to get, we need footage of this, like, or I'm, hey,
5038800	5041440	I are saying something and we want to get them on camera saying this.
5041440	5042440	Can you get over here?
5042440	5046000	But I don't like, talk about the eyes that you see in all those people and how that,
5046000	5050200	like that little kid you saw on the, in the back of the truck, like there's like sometimes
5050200	5054440	the people's eyes, just like you see someone and it's like magnetic, you just get pulled
5054440	5057320	to them.
5057320	5062920	If you want to, you know, if you want to, cause it's a, you know, it's audio, it's a podcast.
5062920	5064760	We know that's, that's probably not interesting.
5064760	5068160	Some of their eyes are magnetic, I don't know.
5068160	5074280	So are you, have I been, maybe I've been stupid, it's like, you're doing all video.
5074280	5077760	Are you, are you doing still photographs or it's, it's video.
5077760	5081280	Last time we did photographs and so I bought the A6000 and then he's like, oh, let's make
5081280	5082280	a documentary.
5082280	5087720	So we just bought a GoPro in Iraq at the mall to make the documentary and use the A6000.
5087720	5089560	So you're a videographer.
5089560	5093960	I have this eighties thing in my head where it's like James Woods with a vest and he's
5093960	5099680	like got film rolls and you know, the right instant will end up on the cover of time and
5099680	5101280	change the way people vote.
5101280	5107280	But it, I mean, that's not, it's like you're, you're, you're, you're getting footage of
5107280	5114000	shit that could also be on the cover of a Harry Potter version of time where the things
5114000	5116080	on the cover move.
5116080	5119760	And do you, do you ever use stills from your video?
5119760	5120760	A little bit.
5120760	5121760	Awesome.
5121760	5122760	Let's take a look.
5122760	5127080	Let's look at your, what do you, what, what would you want people to see?
5127080	5130360	Well, there's three videos that tell a little bit of the story we were just talking about.
5130360	5136240	So let's start with RPG fire, which is, comes from that first firefight we saw.
5136240	5141940	I just fired an RPG in my HTC Vive at home.
5141940	5145160	It's a VR simulator of a.
5145160	5162680	And you can tell us how accurate this is.
5162680	5163680	What the fuck?
5163680	5164680	This is fake.
5164680	5165680	This is the fake one.
5165680	5166680	Weapons and stuff.
5166680	5167680	Wait, what do you mean it's fake?
5167680	5168680	Thousands of dollars.
5168680	5170560	That's a fake Gilligan's Island tour.
5170560	5175660	ISIS shot about two rounds at us and the Iraqi army fired everything that they had
5175660	5176660	back at them.
5176660	5180020	And they were, they were aiming, they were like pivoting towards the cameras at points.
5180020	5181020	Like you can see it.
5181020	5184360	And so like it was very, and then afterwards the second video, they had a musical number
5184360	5185360	for the cameras.
5185360	5188660	Like it was literally like a Pirates of the Caribbean because there's 20 some journalists
5188660	5190000	there all filming.
5190000	5192000	So at the end of this, there's your little firefight.
5192000	5195080	You get your 20 minutes of the Iraqi army shooting at ISIS footage.
5195080	5196840	Then we do a song and a dance.
5196840	5199040	And then, you know, we get you back on the bus and it's away.
5199040	5200960	You're saying I can't wait to break away from that.
5200960	5202320	Show me the real Tijuana.
5202320	5203320	That's what you're saying.
5203320	5207120	But then, okay, so have you seen the fucking beheading videos?
5207120	5208120	Like what happens?
5208120	5213640	A journalist that they don't know your dad, so why does it matter?
5213640	5219120	You know, while you're being beheaded, it takes a long time to use a knife.
5219120	5222800	I put together like a video for cracked before we went out there that was just about ISIS
5222800	5223800	propaganda.
5223800	5227640	So I had to watch all of their beheading videos and it was like, yeah, like that's a little
5227640	5228640	bit intimidating.
5228640	5232280	But at the same time, you're way likelier to get killed in an airstrike just because
5232280	5234020	one of them misses the target.
5234020	5242840	So that's like comforting, kind of, like, yeah, I did, I did, I did have a brief feeling.
5242840	5247680	I remember Easter Sunday, you guys are probably over there was like, just because this is
5247680	5255040	how it is like, what's his face from, you know, North Korea, like unveiled his nuclear
5255040	5256560	missiles and it was Easter Sunday.
5256560	5262720	And we would we went to a barbecue and saw hipsters had to talk about was the idea of
5262720	5268160	what if what if a nuclear missile landed on Los Angeles and blew us all up.
5268160	5272520	And we definitely all agreed that that would be a way better way to go than what would
5272520	5278000	happen if North Korea wasn't in the picture and Trump just had his run, you know, because
5278000	5282560	because the ladder would be like, oh, I'm gonna have to eat a foot.
5282560	5284960	Yeah, it may or may not be my own.
5284960	5290360	I have to swing someone else's daughter as a weapon like, you want to you want to slow
5290360	5291360	cook foot.
5291360	5295080	Like, that's the real key with a foot is you don't want to you don't want to try too fast
5295080	5299200	to cook that because you want to let it's it's also you've got to peel off the cows.
5299200	5303080	Those guys took you through there and they're like, so what's their agenda?
5303080	5307120	They you're American journalists and they want you to they want you to say what?
5307120	5308120	What do they want you to say?
5308120	5309120	What do you mean?
5309120	5314240	Well, well, if they're staging that stuff, it started Isis, a lot of people think that
5314240	5315240	way.
5315240	5320280	So I say it again, magenta, I didn't catch a big popular belief is that Hillary Clinton
5320280	5321280	started Isis.
5321280	5324080	Wait, so just there's nobody over there.
5324080	5327560	That's like, well, if we show you this and that, you'll you'll write that.
5327560	5331840	No, they like the Iraqi army guys want you to say that the Iraqi army is winning the
5331840	5334440	battle against Isis and they're they're good dudes.
5334440	5335600	Most of the guys we met are nice dudes.
5335600	5339160	I have nothing against like, I was really impressed with a lot of them.
5339160	5342600	But they they want you like you get the same thing, whether you're talking to like the
5342600	5346400	Kurdish Peshmerga, which are like these ancestral mountain warriors of the Kurds,
5346400	5349920	or whether you're talking about the Iraqi army or the Iraqi federal police, which are
5349920	5353680	basically an army and they all are like, we love America, we're just trying to stop the
5353680	5354680	bad guys.
5354680	5356560	Please send us more weapons.
5356560	5361120	But don't you get I recently found out there's three women on the Supreme Court.
5361120	5366920	And I mean, I had made a joke about there being only one I what did you graduate?
5366920	5368880	Are you do you have a 200 IQ?
5368880	5370600	Don't you worry about going?
5370600	5374040	That's another reason I wouldn't go to the Middle East because I'd be like, I don't
5374040	5378360	what I can't point to where we are on a map and I don't know anything about any thing.
5378360	5381280	That's how you learn to college dropouts right here.
5381280	5385440	You learn by just being plunged into Europe.
5385440	5389080	No, you go you you went over there and you're like, we'll figure it out.
5389080	5390080	Yeah.
5390080	5391080	Well, that's the say.
5391080	5392640	It's like what Rick says in the first episode of Rick and Morty.
5392640	5396920	It's just like that you you you throw yourself into situations that you don't fully understand
5396920	5401080	and then you grow as a person because you figure it out or you don't know, but you could
5401080	5404680	have gone a burning man.
5404680	5411520	But you went to like burning if the shit is on fire, bomb the fuck out, man.
5411520	5412520	Let's see another one.
5412520	5413520	Let's let's watch.
5413520	5416880	You guys should see like the song and dance routine they do at the end of this one.
5416880	5419240	It's it has dancing or something in there.
5419240	5421760	And this is like, yeah, this is when they were.
5421760	5422960	Yeah, the dance number.
5422960	5424240	He gives a little speech first.
5424240	5426280	We probably don't need to go through it all.
5426280	5429840	It's mostly about how they're sweet.
5429840	5433240	You want to pay attention because we're going to see this guy again, another clip to this
5433240	5434240	dude.
5434240	5435240	This is going to be great for all the listeners.
5435240	5439480	Is that a pencil mustache or is that like a no, he's got a beard.
5439480	5440680	So they really get crazy.
5440680	5443120	The guys that had to shave their beards get big on the mustaches.
5443120	5446280	Oh, they're not allowed to have beards because then you look like Isis.
5446280	5447280	Yeah.
5447280	5448280	Yeah, I got a lot of shit.
5448280	5452280	They thought he was Isis every time they put their hands on their guns being like gosh
5452280	5459280	and it's like it's going to be a while before the beard recovers in Iraq.
5459280	5460960	The beard is tough there.
5460960	5463360	So there's like an anti silver lake over there.
5463360	5467520	So this guy is the colonel who's in charge of that position and his job is like in the
5467520	5472040	evenings and the afternoon he like kills Isis guys and in the morning he leads journalists
5472040	5475840	on a tour and that dude behind him is like you can watch it.
5475840	5477920	Watch his face during this because it's really interesting.
5477920	5480880	He's like the guy who keeps everyone alive when they're running around.
5480880	5484420	He was always whenever people were like shooting at us or near shooting at us.
5484420	5486760	That dude always had his body between magenta and the bullets.
5486760	5488080	He's a really cool dude.
5488080	5499520	He's a really cool dude.
5499520	5508200	That's what he's saying.
5508200	5517360	That's what he is saying.
5517360	5519360	That's their stave leader.
5519360	5525140	He just bones out and he's like I couldn't hold it.
5525140	5528540	Do you speak Arabic?
5528540	5530780	What the fuck was that?
5530780	5535380	You said you dropped out and everybody applauded and you're like oh he's saying that a thermal
5535380	5537220	dang grenade is... what the fuck?
5537220	5538220	What?
5538220	5539220	What do you mean?
5539220	5540220	No, you're smart.
5540220	5541220	You're worldly.
5541220	5542220	You speak other languages.
5542220	5543220	Not mostly.
5543220	5544220	Just badly.
5544220	5550260	It takes a lot to be you and so we all are allowed to not be you.
5550260	5553260	Of course.
5553260	5555780	Nobody trusts me with a budget, Dan, so.
5555780	5556780	What did that guy look like?
5556780	5557780	What character did he look like?
5557780	5558780	He looked like flea.
5558780	5559780	Which one?
5559780	5561180	The little dancing guy?
5561180	5563900	The leap guy looked like old flea.
5563900	5566180	Oh, from um...
5566180	5567180	Chili Peppers.
5567180	5568180	Like California.
5568180	5571300	We're about to see him, so we...
5571300	5573620	Wait, but seriously, linguistically, did you pick up...
5573620	5574620	Did you pick up...
5574620	5576660	No, we had a translator who gave me the gist of that.
5576660	5580340	I speak a little bit of Kurdish, but my Arabic is terrible.
5580340	5581820	I know like eight words.
5581820	5582820	It's bad.
5583380	5590140	I would get off a plane over there and I would be afraid to use the word Arabic, because
5590140	5595100	I would assume from what I've lived through someone would go, uh, Arabic?
5595100	5596100	Rude.
5596100	5597100	And I'd be like, I don't know!
5597100	5598100	I don't know!
5598100	5602860	No, you would be off the plane like 10 minutes before someone was like, oh, this guy clearly
5602860	5603860	needs help.
5603860	5604860	I speak English.
5604860	5605860	Come with me.
5605860	5606860	You want to crash in my house?
5606860	5607860	And then I'd be like, is he going to rape me?
5607860	5608860	He's going to rape me.
5608860	5609860	He wouldn't rape you.
5609860	5612140	I went to Fiji and I couldn't fucking relax.
5612220	5613940	I told the story of this thing.
5613940	5617980	There was a pool guy that was like, come do this fucking low-grade ayahuasca with me in
5617980	5618980	my family's village.
5618980	5622500	And I spent the entire car ride going, they're going to rape us.
5622500	5623500	But they didn't!
5623500	5625260	Because everything different is a threat.
5625260	5630580	But okay, so that's the thing that separates, like before we ever went to a war zone, we
5630580	5634020	traveled a lot in parts of the world where we had experiences where you're in the car
5634020	5636860	with the people that you don't really understand and they're like, oh, is something bad going
5636860	5637860	to happen?
5637860	5641020	Is this the first 15 minutes of an Eli Roth movie and then we all get cut to pieces?
5641420	5642420	Like is something terrible?
5642420	5643420	And it doesn't.
5643420	5644420	That's what I've always said.
5644420	5645420	Eli Roth, that's what I've always said.
5645420	5649420	But when it doesn't happen five or six times in a row, you stop thinking about that as
5649420	5650420	much.
5650420	5651420	You're like, Eli Roth doesn't exist.
5651420	5652420	But he does.
5652420	5654420	Yeah, but he's just a mediocre director.
5654420	5655420	No, but that, yeah.
5655420	5656420	Okay.
5656420	5657420	Oh, shit.
5657420	5658420	You're shot fired.
5658420	5662420	It doesn't matter.
5662420	5664140	He's probably not that gifted a writer.
5664140	5666140	I don't think he'd disagree with that.
5666140	5667140	Oh, shit.
5667140	5669500	His stories largely have a first act of people.
5669500	5674220	I'm so glad we're getting on to this subject because fuck that guy.
5674220	5678220	I want to know, what do we need to know that we don't know?
5678220	5682860	Like what do you see over there that we might be getting the bullshit story on?
5682860	5686740	Here's the thing that I do want to make sure I talk about because I don't want to get off
5686740	5687740	of it.
5687740	5691220	There's an anarchist feminist militia that are the people who are actually beating ISIS
5691220	5693900	in Syria right now.
5693900	5697420	Not surprised.
5697420	5700700	When you hear about them on the news, you'll hear like the United States government has
5700700	5704300	increased its aid to the SDF, the Syrian Democratic Forces.
5704300	5709380	70-ish percent of the Syrian Democratic Forces are a group called the YPG, the People's Protection
5709380	5710380	Units.
5710380	5714700	The YPG and their sister unit, literally sister unit, the YPG, which is the Female People's
5714700	5716500	Protection Units, okay?
5716500	5720540	They are, when we went to Iraq the first time, we started touring all these refugee camps
5720540	5724180	where there were a bunch of Yazidi survivors of the genocide ISIS carried out.
5724180	5727340	So these are people like, I was asking about like, oh, hey, America.
5727340	5731220	This is the only time that the U.S. intervened in a timely manner to help stop a genocide,
5731220	5732220	like ever.
5732220	5735040	Like ISIS started killing these people and we sent in airstrikes and I expected them
5735040	5739460	to be like, yeah, we're really grateful to the United States for stopping ISIS.
5739460	5740860	None of them had that to say.
5740860	5742800	They were all like, no, it was the YPG.
5742800	5746780	So what happened is during, when ISIS was on the move and they were expanding in Iraq
5746780	5750900	and expanding in Syria and everybody was running away, the Iraqi army was fleeing from them,
5750900	5754700	the Kurdish military was fleeing from them, all the different Syrian militias were fleeing
5754700	5758060	from them and they were just growing unchecked like a giant fucking tumor.
5758060	5762140	In the middle of all that, they're massacring the members of this religious sect in Iraq
5762140	5767580	called the Yazidis who live in Mount Sinjar and the YPG, who is again a feminist, anarchist
5767580	5768580	militia.
5768580	5769580	Here's what's happening.
5769580	5770580	This is happening.
5770580	5773260	They're fighting their own desperate battle against ISIS and getting pushed back.
5773260	5777700	And they divert forces from this battle for survival to invade Iraq.
5777700	5778700	Devort?
5778700	5779700	You fucking idiot.
5779700	5786060	He doesn't even know words.
5786060	5789460	This motherfucker just gave away the plot to wander woman.
5789460	5791460	Sorry.
5791460	5797380	So these guys, and ladies, punch a hole in ISIS's lines in Iraq, rescue tens of thousands
5797380	5801700	of people, avert a genocide, and then leave forces behind to train a militia.
5801700	5805860	And the only complaint that we heard the people we talked to there make about them is that
5805860	5810100	the Yazidis are a very traditional, traditional in the sense that they don't let women do
5810100	5811100	a lot.
5811100	5814300	And they were like, well, they forced our women to learn how to fight.
5814300	5817420	They gave them guns and we didn't want them to give our ladies guns and now our women
5817420	5818420	have guns.
5818420	5820420	And it's frustrating to us because we didn't like them.
5820420	5823060	That sounds like an indie movie, right?
5823060	5826100	They're like, well, you know, it is what it is.
5826100	5829740	This is going to sound like a really loaded liberal question, but do you think the reason
5829740	5834980	we're not aware of that very, very marketable phenomenon that would make a really compelling
5834980	5838660	story is, you know, do you think that's being filtered out?
5838660	5839660	You think that's a threat?
5839660	5840660	Oh, hell yeah.
5840660	5841660	Absolutely.
5841660	5842660	Do you think it's a threat to the first world?
5842660	5849300	The idea that women and the men who support them, not in a chivalrous way, but in a fucking
5849300	5854660	like, like, fuck it way, like, that that will be the solution.
5854660	5856780	Like that that's the last thing anyone wants to hear.
5856780	5862340	There's a lot to be scared of in that because like, when, when Rohava is one of the names
5862340	5864860	you'll find them under, they don't go by Rohava anymore.
5864860	5865860	They're not a state.
5865860	5869660	It's like a democratic, it's democracy without a state is the way you'll hear it described
5869660	5870660	a lot.
5870660	5874340	It's a weird system of government that's based around like one of the things they do is they
5874340	5878140	elect a man and a woman simultaneously to every political position and they have to
5878140	5880720	come to an accord before anything can get decided.
5880720	5884500	So it's like it is actually a perfect 50-50 representation.
5884500	5888580	And in some of these towns when they took over from the Syrian government and they were
5888580	5892560	like, hey, ladies, like we have female organizations for lady journalists.
5892560	5894100	We have female military units.
5894100	5898100	Like we have female farming collectives, like you're free to have a job and do whatever
5898100	5899980	you want and participate in politics now.
5899980	5904020	There were some areas where the divorce rate went to like 50% from almost nothing.
5904020	5906700	Like half the women there just left their husbands were like, oh shit, I can go do stuff
5906700	5907700	now?
5907700	5912180	Well, fuck this noise, like I'm going to go do shit.
5912180	5914660	So yeah, there's definitely an element of it that it's a threat.
5914660	5919620	And there is a reason that you only hear to them referred to as the SDF rather than a
5919620	5924060	feminist anarchist militia who's rabidly against the idea of states.
5924060	5927220	Yeah, that's bad ass, that's bad ass.
5927220	5932980	I wanted to make sure I got in my crazy left wing screed before I met there.
5932980	5937220	There was one question like, is there any pressure from your employers, the media to
5937220	5940700	show the Middle East in a specific different light than you observe?
5940700	5943740	But I think that's I mean, you're a freelancer.
5943740	5947500	I mean, no, I'm salaried with crack, but they don't pay for us to go.
5947500	5948980	We just buy plane tickets.
5948980	5959580	We're like, if you can find a bit, I don't know what's wrong with my tweet deck.
5959580	5967180	I thought I saw some shit that was like, you know, tweet, tweet deck, sweet dick, but I
5967180	5968260	always hear that.
5968260	5975220	I set up a little filter for the hashtag thing, but you got anything we should know that we
5975220	5976220	don't already know?
5976460	5977660	There's so much to know in the world.
5977660	5981620	Give me your top one.
5981620	5983020	As quickly as you possibly can.
5983020	5984020	I can't do that.
5984020	5985020	Sorry.
5985020	5986420	I mean, there's just one weird moment.
5986420	5988420	No, no, no, no, no, God damn it.
5988420	5989420	What?
5989420	5990420	That's a, that's a.
5990420	5993700	I am at a podium with a microphone and I asked you a question.
5993700	5994700	Okay.
5994700	6000060	I just got one thing to say for everyone here, do all the shit that you just like talk about
6000060	6002220	and then you put it off and you don't do it and it's just a fantasy.
6002220	6003220	Just do it.
6003220	6004220	Because that's what I did.
6004220	6005220	That's what we're doing.
6005220	6006220	That's what we wanted to do.
6006220	6007220	And it sounds silly.
6007220	6008220	Just.
6008220	6009220	It's worth the wait.
6009220	6011220	I was worth the wait.
6011220	6013220	I knew you had it in you, girl.
6013220	6016220	I knew you had it in you.
6016220	6020820	I still want to know though, I still want to know as a, as a person who has, who is
6020820	6026020	three weeks into having decided to get back on the elliptical.
6026020	6030260	I still want to understand what it is that put me on it in the first place because I
6030260	6033660	know once I was on it, I wanted to stay on it.
6033660	6037700	And I know once I got off it, it got easy to stay off it, but I'm trying to isolate
6037700	6044060	that moment so that we can bottle it, put it in a little pill that's like, take action
6044060	6048500	because we all know this, like we hear it all the time in our own heads and we hear
6048500	6052180	it from the people we admire that they're like, Hey, that thing that you want to do,
6052180	6053180	just do it.
6053180	6059620	And it's like, how, how were you scared the first time you like wrote up a pilot or wrote
6059620	6063020	with the first thing that you wrote that you submitted to somebody, you respect it.
6063020	6064580	And they had a chance to turn it down.
6064580	6069220	It's almost like the path that led me to where I am ego, ego, ego.
6069220	6073260	Like I was too fucking dumb to know how untalented I was.
6073260	6074260	Well there you go.
6074260	6075260	That's great.
6075260	6076260	Okay.
6076260	6078820	Well, so I played a lot of D and D and watched Indiana Jones movies as a kid.
6078820	6080540	So that was, that was everything.
6080540	6084660	I mean, it's like, it's like, okay, yeah, but it's like, it's, it's, if something seems
6084660	6089140	scary to someone or even beyond scary, if it just seems like, ah, this isn't the time
6089140	6090140	to do that.
6090140	6091140	I get fucking.
6091380	6092660	Got to go to work at Starbucks.
6092660	6093660	Yeah, I got to go work.
6093660	6098100	Or just, yeah, it's like, I got to do shit yesterday and I got to do shit tomorrow.
6098100	6102220	If I even have a time to think right now, then I owe it to myself to just sit here and
6102220	6107980	think what in that moment, like, yeah, yeah, I'm going to answer my own question.
6107980	6109260	My fucking therapist answered it.
6109260	6111060	It's like, this never leads anywhere.
6111060	6112460	Thought doesn't lead to action.
6112460	6113700	Only action leads to action.
6113700	6114700	You said it yourself.
6114700	6115860	You just have to do it.
6115860	6119500	Even though it does it, it vexes us because we're addicted to thought.
6119500	6120980	We have that luxury.
6121460	6123140	We're addicted to safety as well.
6123140	6126420	We're addicted to just like we have the luxury of going.
6126420	6127220	That's what we do.
6127220	6128100	We're on King's Landing.
6128100	6133660	So we go, we can't, we can make a difference when we go, I'd like that funding to go
6133660	6134180	over here.
6134180	6139180	And we mistake that for meaning that as individuals, it's okay for us to go.
6139660	6145940	Well, I've decided I'm a vegan or I've decided I'm left, but right of this.
6146340	6148540	It's words and it's thoughts.
6148540	6153380	Whereas the things that everybody in this room knows that all the shit that changed
6153380	6155140	them is shit that they just did.
6155140	6156900	We have so much support.
6156900	6159820	Like if you're homeless in America, you're still going to have clean water.
6159820	6161100	You're still going to find a toilet.
6161100	6161980	You're not going to starve.
6161980	6163300	Like you're in America.
6163300	6168940	So rely on the community or the culture that we don't have and miss that week of
6168940	6171740	work, even if you get fired to pursue what you want to do, because you're still at
6171740	6173700	the end of the day going to have a clean place to shit.
6173700	6175940	And at least you're a step closer to trying something different.
6179540	6180820	You're going to have a clean place to shit.
6180820	6181980	No matter what you're in America.
6181980	6182380	It's fine.
6182380	6183180	Just try some shit.
6183180	6187380	I can definitely, but to the extent that logic is employed there, I can twist that
6187380	6188340	into like, okay, yeah.
6188340	6190260	So I should stay put and like I'm doing great.
6190580	6192380	Yeah, you are, you are doing great.
6192380	6195340	So I'm not going to do anything different tomorrow because even if I'm homeless, I
6195340	6197660	can shit in a clean, no one makes you happy.
6198900	6199540	Fuck you guys.
6199540	6200300	Don't high road me.
6200340	6201980	No one's telling you to do anything different.
6201980	6203460	We all want season four.
6203580	6206860	The bottom line is, yeah, like there is how you met Joel.
6207700	6211620	I went because I moved what, what I, because I moved, you just fucking did it.
6211700	6213300	You'd moved out, dropped it.
6213300	6214900	And I hitched her right on his U-Haul.
6215460	6217100	I've taught you guys, I'm Gollum.
6217100	6222580	Like I, I felt like a ring fell near me and I was like, this is precious.
6222620	6226540	And then one day it fell away.
6226540	6228060	It would no matter where it fought.
6228060	6228940	That's when I moved.
6228940	6230300	I go, well, this is less precious.
6230300	6231540	I want the precious back.
6231540	6233060	Like that's all I've ever done.
6233060	6233980	That's all I do.
6234620	6235180	Okay.
6235220	6235980	You got it.
6236340	6237700	Well, who doesn't that describe?
6238340	6240060	That doesn't describe you.
6240060	6241260	You fucking dick.
6241420	6242820	It's a whole planet of Gollum.
6242860	6244620	That's the whole, that's the whole, you're not Gollum.
6244620	6248340	When you go to the middle east, Gollum never goes to the middle east.
6248580	6251940	I mean, he goes, there's, well, no, he doesn't go to a desert, it's a fog, right?
6251940	6253140	Kids that are starving.
6253140	6255860	And then you go have some fancy fucking meal at night every night while you're
6255860	6259220	out there, you're just doubling down on that.
6259260	6260540	Gollum would never do that.
6260660	6262820	He'd be like, no, those kids make me uncomfortable.
6262820	6264620	I'm going to go eat fish in a cave.
6265020	6266580	Those kids don't have any fish, Dan.
6266940	6268020	The Gollum doesn't care.
6268020	6269180	He doesn't want to think about that.
6269180	6270860	And he wants his precious to think about it.
6270860	6271860	We all want our precious.
6271900	6274060	No, you want photo journalism.
6274180	6276900	Yeah, but that's not feeding the kids that you see over there.
6280740	6284340	That's not bad as that place that Gollum's in a middle earth.
6284380	6286300	That's just the goblins mountain.
6286580	6292340	Gollum, Gollum hangs out in mortar because that's where he found a comfortable place.
6293660	6299300	All right, look, let's, Annie, let's just accept that we're all, we're all
6299300	6302660	equidistant from transformative human evolution.
6303980	6306020	So you guys really aren't that much better than me.
6306340	6306980	Well, why?
6306980	6307740	Certainly not.
6308460	6312380	There's real secrets and I learned earlier, I'm just like John
6312380	6316980	Sweden, because I don't make a community movie.
6317420	6318740	I'm fucking nailing it.
6319860	6321580	Uh, no, sorry.
6322300	6324300	It's not like skydivers are better.
6324340	6326140	You're not like yelling at skydivers.
6326140	6326500	Are you?
6326500	6327980	It's just like, that's what gets them off.
6328020	6329940	I silently judge skydivers.
6329940	6330260	I do.
6330300	6331100	Well, why?
6331180	6335540	Because they needlessly risk death in a world where life is precious.
6335540	6337820	That's where I find them atrocious people.
6337860	6339700	Well, nobody needs us.
6339700	6341380	So you go on roller coasters.
6341540	6345140	Yeah, at least I don't do it so that my friends don't judge me.
6346460	6347420	I'm judging you.
6349380	6351180	I, can I say something, man?
6351180	6354140	I think one thing is that it's about bravery a little bit.
6354140	6357540	And so kind of about doing good work, you know, that's what they're doing.
6357820	6359460	That's what I know you aspire to do.
6359460	6362700	That's like kind of part of your problem is you want to be good at what you do.
6362740	6363700	To be glorified.
6363780	6367620	Well, maybe, but you also really like know it's edifying for people.
6367620	6371780	I mean, these guys are watching your shows when they're in a dangerous place.
6371780	6373420	I'm recognizing that I do good work.
6373420	6374540	That makes me feel glorious.
6374740	6375060	Okay.
6375060	6377820	Well, that's all I got.
6379540	6381100	How many writers do you think?
6381340	6383500	Say they do it to be glorified.
6384700	6385100	You're right.
6385100	6386020	I am special.
6386180	6386580	Yeah.
6387780	6388900	Thank you, Spencer.
6389660	6391900	I owe it to the world to share my worldview.
6393300	6397420	Well, it's I think I think it's about time for us to wrap up.
6397420	6400220	I thank you guys so much for coming in here and.
6403540	6404540	And thank you, Ivan.
6404540	6405820	Is Ivan still here?
6408220	6409900	And thank you, Joel, for.
6410900	6421380	Yeah, Joel at one time went to the Iraq of making his own fucking TV show where he sat
6421380	6425980	with the fucking robots and made fun of movies like that was not a runway laid out for you.
6425980	6427940	That was that was brave.
6429220	6430620	Yeah, I don't have the problem.
6431100	6432180	I know I'm a hero.
6436220	6438660	I got a shameless plug.
6438740	6441500	Yeah, so you get to plug anything you want to bravery.
6441500	6442700	I have to be shameless.
6442700	6445500	Brandon and I have a podcast starting on August 16th.
6445500	6446180	What?
6446260	6448420	It's called Cracked Gets Personal.
6449020	6453340	We talk about doctors talking about stories of people shoving stuff up their butts.
6453340	6453700	Really?
6454100	6458060	People who killed people, all sorts of great stuff.
6458100	6459420	It's going to be it's going to be great.
6459820	6465580	It sounds like it's not on Feral audio, so you should be aware that it probably it's not funds.
6465580	6471380	ISIS summon direct and we have a documentary on Indiegogo, the Fixers.
6471980	6474780	There's a bunch of there's a trailer up right now and a bunch of footage.
6475060	6481380	If you want to donate, I'll smile at you in my soul, but not in person, probably because I will not know who does that.
6483660	6485660	I remember Sarah Hill's name.
6485700	6487620	She she helps us with the show.
6487620	6488740	I always forget to thank her.
6488740	6489460	Crisper rough.
6489460	6490100	Thank you.

6508300	6509780	No, is that going to start a problem?
6509780	6509940	Is it?
6509940	6511980	Yeah, we're we're Kickstarter people.
6512020	6516020	No, no, no, that's I serve no one.

6520100	6521500	I shit my me undies.
6522540	6523540	Can I tell you something?
6523660	6526140	I quit watching cartoons because I thought they were all shitty.
6526140	6527380	And then I saw Rick and Morty.
6527380	6528460	Oh, well, thank you.
6528460	6529820	Cartoons are shitty.
6530380	6535700	Joel Joel came up to me at the top of the dinner tonight and told me he loves Rick and Marty.
6542260	6543140	I deserved it.
6543140	6546460	I mean, I was kind of burping while I said that.
6546460	6547980	I know it's Rick and Morty, man.
6547980	6551060	I've been to the I've watched a season and a half.
6551420	6552620	See, I did it right there.
6552620	6555620	Are you going to get mad because I said half wrong?
6555980	6558100	It's half, not half.
6561780	6569660	I I I somehow feel like I'm landed in a cage where I have to I have to end the show with a rap.
6569660	6571020	With a rap. Yes.
6573260	6573900	Yes.
6576940	6578980	And you have so much of an Elise to talk about.
6581900	6586700	I don't think they're ready.
6587900	6589220	What do you mean?
6589220	6590300	I don't think they're ready.

6700540	6702060	Everyone is hot.

6796860	6799420	Why isn't he out of breath?
6799420	6804620	Because he exercised six months ago.
6804620	6807980	Catching up to me now, though.
6807980	6813180	Starting to feel my respiratory system slowing down.
6813180	6817580	The lungs are labored.
6817580	6819580	Tapered.
6819580	6822460	OK, here's the thing.
6822460	6826140	I'm gonna make the planet Earth sing.
6826140	6828620	I'm gonna share my knowledge.
6828620	6830060	Nothing rhymes with that.
6830060	6831820	College.
6831820	6832300	College.
6832300	6834060	College rhymes with that.

6912060	6914860	I'm trying to do something real and you're waiting.
6914860	6916620	You're like, why doesn't it sound like Will Smith?
6916620	6919260	Because it's not packaged for you.
6919260	6921340	Because what you're experiencing is real.
6921340	6924700	This is the shit that ends up in a Will Smith song.
6924700	6926780	It's called art.
6926780	6928460	Give me a second.
6928460	6930220	Stop judging.
6930220	6930700	One.
6937580	6939420	Kaleo diet.
6942780	6943660	We should try it.
6945180	6947100	It's just oranges and veggies.

6949820	6950780	Are we not ready?
6952620	6958380	What if refined flour and sugars cause boogers?
6960060	6961980	What if caveman had it right?
6961980	6966860	What if everything dietarily was learned the night we discovered
6966860	6970220	to take two sticks and turn them into flame?
6970220	6972860	What if Michael Douglas knew it was a game?
6973660	6974220	Whoa.
6974940	6976780	What if Sean Penn was wrong?
6977420	6981740	What if that movie only took place in a song sung by Vishnu?
6982940	6985180	Oh, I wish you knew that reference,
6985180	6989020	but you didn't stay in Indian high school.
6990700	6992140	Didn't mean to judge.
6993180	6995260	Just want to dance and budge.
6996220	6999180	Eating fudge and sugar in my blood.
6999180	7000620	Cholesterol's too high.

7007660	7008780	Salt and pepper.
7008780	7010060	Two kinds of seasons.
7011900	7013420	Also summer and fall.
7014700	7017660	Fuck your mama till she was less tall.
7017660	7017900	Okay.

7030620	7035740	Who's your bartender?
7035740	7039260	I think he gives you drinks and they're free right now,
7039260	7041420	so probably too late to tip them.
7042620	7043980	I think we'll be back next week.
7045500	7046540	Go to the Middle East.
7048700	7049820	Plain tickets are cheap.
7049820	7053740	I can't seriously say this is a good vacation.
7060620	7076380	Did you get any of that?
7078060	7079740	It's a good show.
