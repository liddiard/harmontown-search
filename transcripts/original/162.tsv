0	18020	From Hollywood, California, in the steamy Cambodian death fields of the warmth of Meltdown Comics'
18020	21020	Nerdmelt leader, Harmon Town, is now in session.
29020	33020	The audience has made an agreement to laugh despite their discomfort.
34020	38020	Despite bathing in the warm humidity of each other's armpits.
39020	42020	Speaking of which, let's bring out Spencer Crichton.
42020	54020	Warmest kids in the world. He deals in humidity.
59020	66020	I have a good idea. Let's bring out the mayor of Harmon Town and bring this shit to order, Mr. Dan Harmon.
66020	72020	Thank you very much.
73020	85020	Thank you. Kumail's here and I want to maximize our Kumail time, but we've got a couple of items of official business.
86020	95020	We've got some awareness. This segment's called Boring Awareness Things about our show.
96020	100020	Boring. Sometimes you've got to say stuff about your show.
101020	105020	And if anyone is listening for the first time, they're like, this is like every podcast.
106020	112020	The first ten minutes is about a bunch of shit, as if I listen to the podcast every week.
113020	117020	But I don't. Sorry, but we're one of them tonight.
118020	123020	We're doing this Harmon Quest thing. It's for real now. It's been a long time.
124020	130020	I thought it was a working title, but I think it's too late now to change it.
131020	134020	If anyone has any ideas, let us know.
135020	137020	No, I don't think we can change the title.
138020	143020	Is that you're admitting that you want to keep that title no matter what? Even in the face of a better title?
144020	148020	I would love to have come up with something like pencils and swords.
149020	155020	But obviously I didn't. I did come up with that, but I was like, well, that's dumb.
156020	158020	I'm quite happy with Harmon Quest.
159020	160020	I know, it's good.
161020	165020	It's an offshoot of Harmon Town, and now we go on a quest. I think that makes very linear sense to me.
166020	172020	Well, an offshoot of Harmon Town? Wouldn't you ideally like the thing to stand on its own?
173020	180020	If I was Kevin Smith, wouldn't you want it to be called Smith Smith Smith-ness?
181020	183020	Smith Smiths and sorcery?
184020	186020	Or would you want a chance to be like, well, Kevin Smith's in it.
187020	192020	However, I also like Dungeons and Dragons. I don't want to force... It's like Appetown.
194020	200020	Hey, I don't care what you... You've got to drink my Kool-Aid, otherwise you can't even give this show a shot.
201020	203020	Are you saying it's too late to make that change now?
204020	205020	Yes.
206020	207020	Why is it too late? We haven't even shot it yet.
208020	211020	I don't know, because I assume that the larger wheels turn earlier and more slowly.
212020	213020	They're not drawing up billboards right now.
214020	218020	All right, well, I'll make a call on Tuesday, but I better have a list of types.
219020	221020	I'm glad we announced the name sucking.
222020	223020	All right.
224020	229020	Are you saying that we should put that flare up in the air for people to give us names for it?
230020	231020	I did, but he thought into it.
232020	233020	No, because then they'll sue us.
234020	238020	But the real reason we bring it up is because the tapings, which we're going to do,
239020	242020	regardless of what it ends up being called, are happening very soon.
243020	246020	Within the next couple of weeks, September 15th, we start taping for a week.
247020	248020	Two weeks?
249020	250020	Yeah, like eight days, I think?
250020	253020	Eight days. It's like a week. Yeah, it's like a week-ish.
254020	258020	And there's like five separate tapings that we're going to need, each of which will...
259020	260020	Two episodes, two episodes.
261020	263020	Yeah, there's five nights with two showings each night, I believe.
264020	266020	So you can sign up for any of those ten shows?
267020	269020	No, I think you can sign up for any of those five nights.
270020	271020	Oh, and you're there the whole night?
272020	275020	You're there for two shows, two episodes worth of taping, which will take a couple hours.
275020	279020	And we'll move you around in the seats between each episode,
280020	282020	so it looks like there's a different crowd every night.
283020	287020	And we'll change shirts, but you'll be there for two episodes,
288020	290020	which I think will be good. That's the way we did the original stuff.
291020	296020	And so what I'm going to do, because we don't have the information that you need right now.
297020	299020	Also, I think it would be weird for me to announce it right now,
300020	302020	because then to the extent that you are an adoring fan,
302020	305020	you'd have to spend the next five minutes going like,
306020	308020	let me get my foot in that door before it sells out.
309020	310020	I'm flattering myself, I know.
311020	316020	But I want you to just enjoy and not have anxiety about Black Monday,
317020	318020	or whatever the hell it's called, Boxing Day.
319020	322020	I don't want this rush for... The Cabbage Patch Doll Rush.
323020	324020	Cyber Tuesday.
325020	329020	So what I'll do is on Tuesday at noon, noonish, right around noon,
329020	333020	so now you're forewarned, like right around noon Tuesday,
334020	336020	when we have the information, I'll tweet a link to a website
337020	341020	where you can rush to reserve seats for the Harmon Quest.
342020	345020	For the whole audience? That'll be our whole audience, is that rush?
346020	348020	Well, again, I flatter myself, but I don't think we're going to need more.
349020	350020	If that would be the way to do it, that'd be awesome,
351020	354020	as opposed to just having people that may or may not know exactly what we're doing.
355020	357020	Yeah, no, I don't think we're going to need to go get people off the street,
357020	358020	but I do think we're going...
359020	361020	Do we know how big the... I talked to the guy that's producing it,
362020	364020	do we know how big the studio audience is yet?
365020	366020	Like 110 people.
367020	368020	That's great. Yeah.
369020	370020	We can do that five times.
371020	372020	Of course we can. Look at him.
375020	377020	But we're also using one of those services,
378020	379020	we're doing it through a service that I'm sure will then go,
380020	382020	nope, your fans don't like you, now we'll turn this other valve
383020	386020	where tourists are coming in dressed as lobsters for let's make a deal.
388020	391020	I couldn't get into the prices right, but I guess I'll watch this guy.
392020	394020	What if it was only the same two or three hundred people
395020	396020	that just kept sifting through the whole time wearing different shirts?
397020	398020	That'd be fine with me.
399020	400020	Yeah, no, I have no problem with that.
401020	403020	People can come every show.
404020	408020	What I would like people not to do is just automatically before they figure out
409020	412020	that they can make every show reserve a ticket for every show,
413020	414020	because that's a ticket we can't...
414020	417020	You know, try to split the difference between precaution and...
418020	420020	Because at the same time we're going to be like 10% overbooking and all that shit.
421020	424020	So there's bullshit going both ways, ain't there?
425020	428020	We're both going to fuck each other over.
429020	431020	Just hit every elevator button in the car.
432020	436020	Why didn't we make the smart move and do all five tapings at Madison Square Garden?
437020	439020	All right, so moving on.
439020	447020	Festival Supreme, Jack Black's Lollapalooza of comedy and music is happening in October.
448020	449020	Harmontown is doing a show.
450020	453020	Jeff isn't going to be able to participate, but we're doing a Harmontown Festival Supreme.
454020	455020	Sadly, I'll be out of town.
456020	461020	I know we do, but I don't, because I don't personally right now.
462020	465020	Does anyone have any details about when our show is for Festival Supreme?
466020	467020	It's October 10th.
468020	469020	They gave Jeff.
470020	471020	I think it's October 10th.
472020	476020	I know that because I think that's the date I found out that I had been booked on a long time ago.
477020	478020	That makes sense.
479020	480020	But I could be wrong about that, but double check that.
481020	482020	It's a 10th, but we don't have a time yet.
483020	484020	Oh, all right.
485020	486020	Well, I'm out of town no matter what fucking time it is.
489020	491020	I came down a little hard on Steve on that one.
494020	495020	I wish we had a big...
495020	498020	See, one day I want to move the show to a big sound stage so that we can...
501020	503020	Mr. Spielberg!
505020	507020	It's Nine Foot Neel.
509020	513020	I can't see around in this pillar, because I'm tall.
514020	517020	Nine Foot Neel should meet Tay Brixon.
519020	522020	The tallest fan of the show should meet the littlest show promoter.
526020	528020	You see me coaxing you back into Tay Brixon.
529020	530020	Is it Ty or Tay? I know, I forgot.
531020	532020	Ty Brixon.
533020	537020	When we do get bigger, more comfortable digs with room to create a space,
538020	542020	I would like to put Steve Levy in a little circular research desk.
543020	545020	Oh, so he's our newsroom back there?
546020	548020	Yeah, he can have a little internet, like the center.
549020	551020	And then he can just tell me about my calendar and about...
552020	554020	He can do corrections at the end of the show?
555020	559020	Yeah. And he could be the one to put through tweets from people that are watching live,
560020	563020	and we'll have them up on a screen, and then I got big plans.
564020	565020	That's a great idea.
566020	568020	But I know you do what it is. It's bullshit.
569020	571020	Well, I don't need you. You're an original fan. I don't need you.
574020	575020	Who cares?
576020	578020	That's how I felt about the fucking pixies. Look what they did to me.
579020	580020	They broke up twice.
581020	583020	You just Donald Trumped the whole audience right now.
583020	585020	And they had a big laugh about it.
586020	588020	Death to the pixies. I love you.
589020	592020	Why are you selling me this shirt? You're making fun of me.
593020	594020	Is that your dick or your thumb?
595020	596020	That's your thumb.
598020	600020	You are a debaser. You really are.
602020	606020	Eight laughs from people with really specific haircuts, I'm sure.
609020	612020	All right, speaking of music, I want to do one segment
613020	616020	and then I'm going to do a mail out and have an open potpourri.
617020	620020	I call it a kumail bag.
621020	623020	A kumail bag?
624020	626020	A kumail bag's not bad.
627020	629020	That implies correspondence, though.
630020	632020	He texted me that he was going to make the show,
633020	635020	and I said, cool, exclamation point, and then two spaces,
636020	637020	and then parentheses, mail.
638020	640020	And then he wrote back an hour later,
641020	643020	I don't understand that that doesn't sound anything like my name
644020	645020	and it's spelled differently.
646020	647020	You've got kumail.
648020	649020	No? Okay.
650020	651020	We'll get to that in a second.
652020	654020	I'm going to think of a 90 worst versions of that.
655020	658020	Here's a segment I call Dan Nitpik's song lyrics.
661020	663020	I like to listen to music and stuff.
664020	666020	Nitpik the lyrics.
667020	669020	Nitpik the lyrics.
670020	671020	Nitpik and the lyrics.
672020	676020	If these were the lyrics to a song, I'd say they were repetitive.
681020	682020	See, I'm not immune.
683020	688020	I don't give myself a pass, so this is where I hold other musicians to the fire,
689020	690020	including their feet.
694020	695020	I frequently nitpick on lyrics.
696020	699020	I think you and I have both sat around a drink
700020	703020	and talked about Billy Joel's tonic and gin.
704020	705020	Come on.
706020	707020	That's the thing, when you're chasing a rhyme,
708020	709020	you don't have to rhyme.
710020	711020	So here's this song.
712020	715020	It's called The Highwayman by The Highwaymen,
716020	718020	the super group, the country western super group.
718020	719020	Waylon Jennings.
720020	721020	Chris Christofferson.
722020	723020	We say all four names differently.
726020	727020	Waylon Jennings.
729020	730020	Chris Christofferson.
731020	732020	Johnny Cash.
733020	737020	It's Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Chris Christofferson and Willie Nelson.
740020	742020	Chris Christofferson, I think, I'm going to guess,
743020	744020	if he's the one who's taking the verse, I think he is,
745020	746020	because I think I recognize everyone else's voice.
747020	748020	I think he showed up to this song pretty drunk.
749020	751020	Johnny Cash goes to space, right?
752020	753020	Yeah, yeah.
754020	755020	The song's called The Highwayman,
756020	757020	it's a country western super group, and they each take a verse.
758020	761020	This is the frustrating thing about these lyrics,
762020	765020	is how I get on board, and I'll walk you through me getting on board.
766020	767020	Willie Nelson starts and says,
768020	771020	I was a highwayman, along the coast roads I did ride,
772020	774020	with sword and pistol by my side.
774020	775020	That's pretty cool.
776020	778020	We're off and running at that point, yeah.
783020	785020	Oh, I'll keep it down if you like.
789020	791020	You're on your own for the rest of this highwayman.
793020	796020	Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade.
797020	798020	Code, but it's good.
799020	802020	Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
802020	803020	Cool.
804020	806020	The bastards hung me in the spring of 25.
807020	809020	I don't know what century you're talking about.
810020	813020	1925 is when we started hanging the people that ran around the highway with swords.
814020	816020	I feel like I'm going to go 17 or 18.
817020	818020	Yeah, I think it was just simply, but he had to rhyme,
819020	820020	but I am still alive.
821020	822020	Okay, so fine, good.
823020	824020	I'm on board, because it sounds like it's about a ghost.
825020	826020	Of a highwayman.
827020	829020	Or a timeless character that lives through time.
829020	831020	Well, you're way ahead of everything.
832020	833020	It sounds like a ghost from that.
834020	836020	It doesn't sound like a timeless character who lives through everything.
837020	839020	For me it does, because I've read literature.
840020	843020	No, it's one verse of a song.
844020	845020	I was killed in 1925, but I'm still alive.
846020	847020	That's a ghost!
848020	849020	He's got unfinished business. That's all it is.
850020	851020	A ghost doesn't say I'm still alive.
852020	853020	A ghost says I'm not alive. I'm a ghost.
854020	858020	No, that's a ghost out of cereal box.
859020	861020	I'm a ghost and I love blueberries.
862020	864020	All right, look, I've heard this song 19 million times.
865020	867020	I might be ahead of the curve on this song. I'm sorry.
869020	872020	If ghosts say I'm a ghost with Patrick Swayze,
873020	875020	he would have been a terrible, terrible movie.
876020	877020	He would have woken up after getting shot,
878020	879020	and he would have gone, I'm a ghost, woo.
880020	881020	And then he never would have went to Goldberg.
882020	883020	But none of the ghost and poltergeist guys said,
884020	885020	I'm alive still. I'm a regular person.
886020	887020	They knew what they were fucking getting away with.
887020	888020	All right, second verse.
889020	890020	So here's where Chris Christofferson comes in.
891020	892020	When you listen to the song, you'll hear he's a little,
893020	895020	he's in his cups, as Jeffy would say. He's a little drunk.
896020	897020	I was a sailor.
898020	900020	I was born upon the tide.
901020	903020	With the sea I did abide.
905020	908020	I sailed a scrooner around the horn of Mexico.
909020	912020	I went aloft and furled the main sail in a blow.
913020	914020	Chunky.
915020	916020	In a blow?
917020	920020	And when the yards broke off, they said, I got killed,
921020	922020	but I am living still.
923020	925020	Okay, so now, as Jeff spoiled,
926020	928020	we're talking about a timeless figure here.
929020	932020	Oh, or is it a series of ghosts stepping forward
933020	935020	and saying, here's what I was doing.
936020	939020	At the tip of my cap, my sailor cap, and then the...
940020	941020	Ghost Anonymous.
942020	944020	And then, so I'm assuming this is Waylon Jennings who comes in.
944020	947020	I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide.
948020	950020	We're stealing water did collide.
951020	954020	A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
955020	958020	I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
959020	962020	They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound.
963020	965020	But I am still around.
966020	970020	I'll always be around and around and around and around.
971020	972020	They all come in.
972020	975020	Okay, so I'm like, this sucks great. I love this.
976020	979020	And then Johnny Cash comes in and goes, I fly a starship.
980020	983020	This was the late 70s, early 80s.
984020	986020	If you didn't have a spaceship and a quarter of your shit,
987020	988020	you were off the air.
989020	990020	So take it easy on them.
991020	992020	But it's...
993020	996020	One of them comes in with a guitar that kind of sounds like a laser.
997020	1000020	Without ruining what you want to get through here,
1000020	1002020	can I freeze frame the first time you heard this?
1003020	1004020	Is that recently or is that a while back?
1005020	1007020	I heard this a while back, but I like the song that I've heard.
1008020	1009020	I was listening to it again recently,
1010020	1012020	and then my problem lyric is coming up right at the end.
1013020	1014020	So at the point, the first time I heard the song,
1015020	1017020	I heard the song a bunch of times and never really paid attention to the lyrics,
1018020	1019020	as you often do.
1020020	1022020	You hear a song a million times, oh, I never knew what that song was actually saying.
1023020	1025020	And this one, the first time I realized that Johnny Cash goes to space,
1026020	1027020	that moment was awesome.
1028020	1031020	This is before Cloud Atlas, by the way, this song.
1032020	1033020	I was Tom Hanks.
1034020	1036020	I was a caveman after the war.
1037020	1039020	With Holly Berry in my door.
1041020	1044020	A future-rich lady with cures to my disease.
1045020	1049020	I talked her into easing my sick son's disease.
1051020	1055020	And when she explained to me that the human race was a joke,
1056020	1057020	I was still Tom Hanks.
1058020	1059020	Alright.
1060020	1066020	I'll always be Tom Hanks, and I Hanks, and I Hanks, and I Hanks, and I Hanks.
1067020	1068020	Alright, so anyways.
1069020	1072020	I fly a starship across the universe divide.
1073020	1075020	And when I reach the other side,
1076020	1079020	I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.
1081020	1083020	Perhaps I may become a highwayman again.
1083020	1086020	Oh, shit, awesome, awesome.
1087020	1090020	This is the peak of, I'm like, holy shit, he stitched it all together.
1091020	1092020	He is, he's the same guy.
1093020	1097020	He's in a starship, he's thinking about being a fucking highwayman.
1098020	1102020	Or I may simply be a single drop of rain.
1102020	1115020	But I will remain, oh, pick a team.
1116020	1121020	I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again.
1122020	1123020	Yeah.
1124020	1128020	I mean, they weave this macho, like Cloud Atlas of these guys, like one guy.
1129020	1132020	What's the difference between a dam builder and a highwayman,
1133020	1137020	and a future truck driver in space, like we're all old white men.
1139020	1142020	And there's a spiritual connection that unites us all.
1143020	1146020	But I may be a drop of rain, well, me too.
1147020	1149020	A drop of rain? Who wants to be a drop of rain? That's dumb.
1150020	1151020	Yeah.
1152020	1155020	Actually, Chris, I've never noticed that lyric.
1156020	1157020	That is a very disappointing lyric.
1158020	1161020	Why is the guy in the starship going, going like, who's he talking to?
1162020	1165020	He's going like, I fly a starship, look out for that asteroid.
1166020	1170020	You know, I got this weird feeling, I was a highwayman in a past life,
1171020	1174020	so when I die, I'll probably come back as a highwayman.
1175020	1178020	But fuck it, you know, it made me just general Buddhist shit.
1180020	1186020	I mean, the space man is the most, because you're seeing stars and fucking planets and shit.
1186020	1190020	If you're ever a drop of rain, it's when you're flying through space.
1191020	1192020	Or is he saying that...
1193020	1194020	No, there's no rain in space.
1195020	1196020	No, but I mean, he's like, he's...
1197020	1198020	The rain in space calls...
1199020	1205020	He's only a drop of rain, he's so minuscule, even in comparison to the whole of rain.
1206020	1209020	You're saying, how infinitesimally small is my existence?
1210020	1214020	He's like a cycle of souls, in a cycle of a rain of souls.
1217020	1219020	That keeps going, it's like the water.
1222020	1224020	It's kind of cool.
1225020	1228020	He's also saying that I may come back again.
1229020	1231020	If I come back again and keep doing this...
1232020	1236020	It will either be as one of these people, a human being, or a drop of water.
1237020	1238020	No, it's like metaphorical.
1239020	1245020	The soul cycle is like rain, and he's just part of all of these souls in these internal cycles,
1246020	1247020	and how they used to be highwaymen.
1248020	1251020	But if he's going to use it as a metaphor, then the whole song should be called Drops of Rain.
1252020	1255020	And then they should be like, one drop of rain I was, was called a highwayman.
1256020	1259020	Here's another example of a kind of rain I was.
1260020	1263020	I was a drop of rain named Ralph from Colorado.
1264020	1268020	I slipped ironically on real rain and fell below.
1270020	1273020	These are all lives and they're as pointless as the rain.
1273020	1281020	But each drop will remain until it evaporates again and again and again.
1283020	1285020	But he does say...
1286020	1292020	I go across the universe divide, and when I get to the other side, that implies when he's dead.
1293020	1302020	When I actually go to whatever the afterlife for possibly a cyclic, like a karmic traveler,
1303020	1305020	goes to, maybe I find out, maybe I'm nothing.
1306020	1307020	Maybe that was all pointless.
1308020	1311020	Maybe I'm just one of these stars in this endless space that we look at, like Spencer said.
1312020	1313020	I think it's cool.
1314020	1318020	I thought it was dumb until it got resolved where he'd still remain, and it would be like, oh, it's a metaphor.
1319020	1322020	I don't like when people say rain and rhyme again and again.
1323020	1325020	Because first it was highwaymen and again.
1326020	1327020	They said again like we said.
1328020	1330020	You didn't get the change on the scene.
1331020	1332020	I like that all the guys are...
1333020	1336020	It's a human song. It's not a song about a fucking cosmology.
1337020	1343020	It's about four different shapes of loner.
1344020	1354020	Just because you're born in a time when a man with integrity didn't even have the option of being a cattle rustler or a highwayman,
1355020	1358020	doesn't mean that while you're welding a rivet on a dam, when you're building...
1358020	1359020	Something is silly.
1360020	1365020	I'm not a cowboy. I'm not a spaceman when I'm welding this dam, but it's four different guys going like,
1366020	1372020	I was a country western archetype, and then I died, but I didn't die because they're all me.
1373020	1377020	It's important to me that that guy be like a guy with...
1378020	1383020	It's a guy. It's about a guy's relationship with the cosmos, not about mapping the cosmos itself and going like...
1384020	1385020	You couldn't die and become nothing.
1385020	1391020	One of those ants could be me, and the grains of sand upon the beach.
1392020	1393020	Why not that? Why isn't that...
1394020	1396020	Because that's a different song. That's something you'd hear in an incense store.
1397020	1400020	That's not something you'd listen to when you're drinking a glass of scotch.
1401020	1403020	You're like, yeah, my dad was a fucking spaceman, and I'm gonna...
1404020	1407020	Sorry, are you upset that this song isn't country enough for you?
1408020	1411020	That it goes into the hippie, cosmological, metaphysical of the very...
1412020	1420020	I don't like going from... When I get to the other side, which is like Tolkien-esque, like the elves going across, there's like, I'm a person, and I have a...
1421020	1422020	I thought you didn't like Tolkien.
1423020	1424020	I don't like those elves, man.
1425020	1430020	How do you just turn off your mortality by going on a fucking boat? What the shit is that?
1431020	1432020	Thanks, Steve.
1433020	1438020	Well, now what we're finding out is you'd like it as they got right off the shore, they all turned into rain.
1439020	1450020	Well, I'm just... If I was observing my life over millennia cycling and cycling and cycling, I might have the thought that shit, maybe millions of other people are doing the same thing, and that's also kind of interesting.
1451020	1452020	I guess.
1453020	1454020	But only worth a passing mention.
1455020	1460020	I will agree, Dan. I don't think that the song Highwayman succeeds in doing what it tries to...
1461020	1469020	It fumbles on the goal line a little bit, of the goal line they're trying to cross. It's like, this is a giant metaphysical thing going on.
1470020	1475020	Like, I get what they're going for, but it doesn't quite succeed in either way.
1476020	1479020	Highwayman lyrics, you've been nit-picked.
1486020	1487020	It's a good song, though.
1487020	1491020	Kimeo Nanjiani is here.
1493020	1494020	Kimeo Nanjiani.
1498020	1499020	Kimeo Nanjiani.
1500020	1501020	Hello. Hello.
1504020	1506020	Is Alan Wu coming, or what?
1507020	1509020	Alan Wu is actually directing Harmon Quest.
1510020	1511020	Oh, and he's not here.
1511020	1518020	People at home who aren't watching video, there's a seat very ostentatiously reserved in the front row that says, reserved Alan Wu on it.
1519020	1520020	Yeah, it's like that.
1521020	1525020	It's the only empty seat here, and it's the one guy here that's directing Harmon Quest.
1526020	1529020	Maybe he's running around the back of this house holding up his fingers like the camera frame thing.
1532020	1535020	Dan, can I say something? I'm with you on that song.
1536020	1539020	These guys are... You guys are working too hard to make sense of something.
1539020	1540020	It makes sense.
1541020	1544020	Can I say, I wrote down this quote you said, Spencer.
1545020	1547020	First off, Kimeo, I didn't say it made sense.
1548020	1551020	I come down to the side, I get where they're going, I don't think they nail it.
1552020	1560020	And I think Dan's right in saying, if it had just stuck to a song about the archetype of the loner that goes on through time,
1561020	1566020	and that will always be as we go on through the cosmos, I think they could have done either or and made it better.
1567020	1569020	Well, I think it's... Well, this is what Spencer said.
1570020	1571020	What did I say?
1572020	1580020	Spencer said, if you're ever a drop of rain, it's when you're flying through space and everyone here nodded like, yeah, that's true, Spencer.
1581020	1588020	I think it's funny that it's Johnny Cash's, they all clearly wrote their own verses, and they're like, I'm going to be a dam builder.
1589020	1592020	I'm going to be a boatman. And Johnny Cash is like, I'm going to drive a space ship.
1593020	1594020	I'm not sure about that. I don't know.
1595020	1600020	If I had my guess, this is totally a guess, and we will verify this later on. I'll look it up later.
1601020	1603020	My guess is that Chris Jefferson wrote the whole thing.
1604020	1605020	It was ours or one other person wrote the whole thing.
1606020	1609020	It seems to me so different, because he's the biggest star, Johnny Cash.
1610020	1612020	I bet they had a meeting where they're like, well, we've got to have Johnny Cash.
1613020	1617020	If he's going to be a spaceman, we'll put him at the end. Hopefully people will stop paying attention to the lyrics by then.
1618020	1621020	But they were all collaborators through so much of their careers.
1622020	1628020	Yeah, and I will also interject there that at this particular point in time, Willie Nelson could have been the big gun.
1629020	1630020	It depends from year to year.
1631020	1637020	Johnny Cash went through a heavy period of time where he was like, sort of, oh, it's like the way we thought about Roy Orbison.
1638020	1639020	We're going to win the travel like we'll always have.
1640020	1641020	Well, there's Roy Orbison. But anyways.
1642020	1645020	But then Johnny Cash got co-opted by hipsters. He's like the hipster.
1646020	1647020	That was much, much later.
1648020	1649020	That was recently.
1650020	1651020	God damn it.
1652020	1653020	Fucking damn it.
1654020	1655020	Raindrop.
1656020	1659020	Oh, the rhyme scheme is actually pretty sophisticated.
1660020	1662020	If you gave them each a verse, I don't know.
1663020	1667020	It's weird. The sailor one is kind of fucking a mouthful.
1668020	1669020	I heard the furloom.
1671020	1673020	That sounds like Chris Christopher.
1674020	1675020	Yeah, I don't know.
1675020	1679020	I don't know. I don't know if it was like, you know, like an MC thing where they came in with it written on their hand.
1680020	1681020	And they're like, I was I was a plumber.
1682020	1684020	And everyone's like, fuck, did he? This is supposed to be an epic song.
1685020	1687020	I plunged the shit out of the crap.
1688020	1690020	The shit out of the crap.
1691020	1692020	I sorted it upon my lap.
1693020	1696020	I found the peanuts, distinguished turds from diarrhea.
1697020	1701020	And then they were like, well, we got to put someone in a spaceship to balance this out.
1702020	1708020	I do remember like, like probably in my teens or 20s being disappointed when they changed again to a gain.
1709020	1711020	And I hate when songs make it a gain.
1712020	1713020	That's dumb.
1714020	1715020	Yeah.
1716020	1721020	Or when they backwards sing, which we talked about too, when they put like, they do Yoda speak, like just to make the rhyme.
1722020	1723020	That's the worst.
1724020	1726020	What's a good example of that when somebody's like, like...
1727020	1730020	And my love you will have...
1731020	1732020	You're right. Yeah. Yeah.
1733020	1734020	Tonic and gin. Yeah.
1735020	1736020	Tonic and gin. Fucking.
1737020	1738020	My love you will have.
1739020	1742020	All right. So we watched Nightmare on Elm Street 2 this weekend.
1743020	1744020	And one.
1745020	1749020	We watched one because of Wes Craven passing and we thought we'd honor him again.
1750020	1752020	And I think it made a difference.
1753020	1755020	I want to beat that lyric before I move on.
1756020	1763020	My belt is buckled with the topaz of my pain.
1764020	1765020	I don't know.
1766020	1769020	You got to bring it back to a country western thing, like a belt buckle or a beer bottle or something.
1770020	1771020	I love the topaz of my pain.
1772020	1773020	Topaz of my pain.
1774020	1775020	Or not topaz. What's the other thing?
1776020	1777020	Turquoise.
1778020	1780020	My belt is buckled with the turquoise of my pain.
1781020	1782020	No, that would be dumb.
1783020	1786020	I don't think Johnny Cash ever said the word turquoise in his life.
1791020	1792020	Nightmare on Elm Street, we watched it.
1793020	1796020	So then we thought, let's just watch Nightmare on Elm Street 2 because we kept talking about what we were watching.
1797020	1802020	Camille was there and Shrob and Emily and Agee.
1803020	1804020	And Holy Cats!
1805020	1807020	Nightmare on Elm Street 2 is super gay.
1808020	1813020	There's no fear of that sounding like a homophobic or inaccurate statement.
1814020	1816020	It is one of the gayest movies that's ever been made.
1817020	1818020	It's gay as fuck.
1819020	1820020	And it's kind of beautifully gay.
1821020	1823020	It's not even that pornographicly gay.
1824020	1828020	There are some prurient, externalized gay things about it.
1829020	1832020	There's a lot of people taking their shirts off and doing push-ups together.
1833020	1837020	But the thing that really makes it gay is the gay love, the relationship.
1838020	1844020	There are two guys and there's a part where they're both fighting and one guy pulls his pants down and the fight continues with just one guy's butt out.
1845020	1846020	There's a lot of that kind of stuff.
1847020	1848020	Well, it's the equivalent.
1849020	1858020	Today it would be looked at as totally progressive because there's a girl in the movie but there's not an inch of skin outside her arms or collarbone exposed.
1859020	1860020	She's just sort of like a regular person.
1861020	1863020	And she doesn't get in any pillow fights or have any friends.
1864020	1868020	But the guys have friends that pull each other's pants down and roll around and they're all hunky and stuff.
1869020	1870020	Is it never acknowledged? Did they speak about this?
1871020	1874020	They don't really talk about it. It's just from like an alternate universe where men are objectified.
1875020	1879020	Well, what they do keep talking about is how one of them who...
1880020	1881020	A lonely clap in the back of the room.
1882020	1889020	What they do keep talking about because that's the one where Freddy is inside the kid and so the whole movie is about...
1890020	1891020	A kid.
1892020	1895020	It's about a kid going... It's being misunderstood by people and going like,
1896020	1897020	I don't know who I am.
1898020	1901020	And according to Shrob, the writer actually in an interview said,
1902020	1909020	yes, I was thinking of this as a metaphor for being young and figuring out that you're gay.
1910020	1914020	But he didn't expect the director to then take it and then double down on it.
1915020	1919020	Writers often have... My original writing mentor, when I was writing Monster House,
1920020	1922020	one of the first pieces of advice he gave me is he said,
1923020	1925020	and I don't know if this is... Maybe I'm betraying this?
1926020	1928020	Am I going to be Bruce Lee teaching people kung fu?
1929020	1931020	And now, yeah, because now everybody knows kung fu.
1939020	1940020	That's why they never wanted it to get out.
1941020	1942020	Yeah. Oh, fuck.
1943020	1945020	Why you got fucking Jackie Chan running around?
1948020	1950020	He said every screenwriters always have a secret.
1951020	1952020	They have a secret about the movie.
1953020	1955020	You try to be transparent in all your work.
1956020	1960020	Get your own head on paper and be really clear about things and passionate.
1961020	1965020	But then there's one little exception to that, which is the writer should know something that nobody else knows.
1966020	1969020	Like the basketball in Monster House is DJ's puberty.
1970020	1973020	It's his boyhood bouncing over to the house or something like that.
1974020	1978020	I think that was me phoning in his advice going, okay, it's his puberty, I'll keep that a secret.
1981020	1984020	But so anyways, if that writer had then handed that...
1985020	1986020	That actually makes a lot of sense.
1987020	1988020	Well, yeah, it's their basketball.
1989020	1994020	Yeah, it goes in and it's him becoming a grown-up and having a deal with grown-up shit like a fucking Monster House.
1995020	1996020	It's true. Well done.
1997020	2002020	Yeah, like a mortgage, you know, like when your property is who you are.
2003020	2008020	As opposed to being a kid, kids trick or treat, they go and they take what they want from the grown-ups.
2009020	2013020	They're communists and parents are capitalists and the basketball is...
2014020	2015020	So he's going from communism to capitalism.
2016020	2017020	Which is going from boyhood to adulthood.
2018020	2019020	Wow.
2020020	2021020	Because communism is not viable.
2022020	2024020	That should have been the tagline for the movie.
2024020	2025020	Communism is not viable.
2026020	2027020	Communism is not viable.
2028020	2029020	Monster House.
2030020	2031020	What?
2032020	2033020	Who's this for?
2035020	2037020	The bourgeoisie is the monster.
2038020	2040020	All right, so, yeah, well, I mean, I just want...
2041020	2046020	I mean, well, because one of the most interesting things is that in Friday, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, part one,
2047020	2050020	the girl is a typical kind of scream queen.
2051020	2053020	She's being stalked by this Freddy guy.
2054020	2061020	She goes to Johnny Depp and she says, I have this idea, like watch me sleep and then wake me up and I'm going to try to grab Freddy.
2062020	2066020	That whole thing is played out in this movie as well, but he goes to the guy's house.
2067020	2073020	Like the guy crawls in the window of another hunky guy's bedroom and wakes him up and he's wearing this midriff shirt.
2074020	2076020	He's like, what's going on, Taylor?
2077020	2078020	And he's like, listen, I really need to talk to you.
2078020	2079020	I really need to talk to you.
2080020	2081020	But like the girl is like in the movie.
2082020	2083020	That's not who he takes his problems to.
2084020	2087020	And he tells him, like, I want you to wake me up with this thing.
2088020	2092020	It's a total rom-com because they start out enemies and then they become really close.
2093020	2094020	Yeah, that's great.
2095020	2096020	I love them.
2097020	2098020	And they're not constantly calling each other fag or anything like that.
2099020	2104020	Like there was a lot of stuff in the 80s where it was like, oh, you're, you know, like guys like bullying each other for being...
2104020	2105020	No.
2106020	2107020	Like calling each other homo while they beat them up.
2108020	2111020	But then in that same scene, it's like, oh, the water is like glistening off of my pecs.
2112020	2117020	And it's like, that's what you expect from the 80s, but this was like more of a just a gay love story.
2118020	2122020	And it was kind of like on the sleeve, on the rolled up fluorescent sleeve.
2123020	2127020	Because we were talking through it, but there's nothing really homophobic that happens in it.
2128020	2129020	I just said that. Moving on.
2129020	2135020	I just, I feel like this is from your leftover high women aggression that's being taken out of me now.
2136020	2137020	I don't think I was ever aggressive about high women.
2138020	2141020	I felt that we found some common ground on high women.
2143020	2146020	I feel like you're bringing some sort of weird nightmare on Elm Street.
2147020	2148020	Three rage on me right now. I don't understand.
2149020	2150020	Nightmare on Elm Street, three is a really good one.
2151020	2152020	That's where they're dream warriors.
2153020	2154020	And they each have a dream power.
2155020	2156020	See, the only thing I know about, I've never seen anything movies.
2156020	2160020	The only thing I know about those movies is that Don Dokken did the soundtrack for it.
2161020	2162020	It was all Dokken songs, right?
2163020	2164020	I don't know who that is.
2166020	2167020	He was a rock and roller.
2168020	2172020	Yeah, well also do yourself a favor and load up the fat boys Freddy Krueger video.
2174020	2175020	When the fat boys are running around the house.
2176020	2181020	We talked about this, our favorite part is that they're being chased by Freddy, but they still find time for donuts.
2182020	2184020	Oh yeah, they're like, oh my God, there's food.
2185020	2186020	But then Freddy is rapping a lot.
2187020	2189020	He's not like just the bridge in the rap. He like starts the rap.
2190020	2192020	He's like, my name is Freddy Krueger and I'm here to say it.
2194020	2196020	Like he really says that. Is that the Will Smith one?
2197020	2198020	Because he also did a thing with Will Smith.
2199020	2201020	Will Smith has one, but Freddy's not in that one. It's just Will Smith talking about Freddy.
2202020	2203020	Oh, he doesn't have like a bridge?
2204020	2205020	I don't think Freddy shows up in the Will Smith one.
2206020	2210020	Okay. But he does say my name's Freddy Krueger and I'm here to say like in the fat boys one.
2211020	2212020	Was he really?
2213020	2215020	Yeah. You I will slay. Yoda talk.
2216020	2217020	Yep. Force that rhyme Freddy.
2218020	2219020	All right.
2220020	2222020	It's like Bobby Brown's rap and Ghostbusters 2.
2223020	2225020	My man Vigo, the master of evil.
2226020	2228020	Vigo and evil? No.
2229020	2230020	That's like again and again.
2231020	2234020	I like when you have like raps at the end that like recap the whole movie.
2235020	2236020	I'm all for that.
2237020	2238020	Ninja Turtles has that.
2238020	2241020	You're like, who is it? Because I just saw the movie. You don't need to recap it.
2242020	2245020	Is it for people who come in at the credits? Like what did I miss? Oh, okay.
2246020	2250020	Yeah, but nowadays like Disney and Pixar movies, they have all those little Easter eggs for the credits.
2251020	2253020	I would be very happy if there was a rap at the end of every movie.
2254020	2255020	Yeah, no, I loved it too.
2256020	2261020	I always feel bad for the rapper. Like I feel like it wasn't his idea to like rap about ghost busting.
2262020	2266020	I just feel like he's like in front of the microphone like seeing the ghost of his dad like shaking his head.
2267020	2269020	Because his dad wanted it to be a laser.
2270020	2273020	When Spock came in with the lasers. Yo, there wasn't tasers.
2274020	2277020	I'm like a Mac daddy, but you know, I've got the lasers.
2278020	2279020	And then he looks over and his dad's like.
2281020	2284020	Wait, what about the boy? You used to rap about selling cocaine.
2286020	2290020	Yeah, not rhyming lasers with tasers and lasers.
2292020	2293020	You could have said phasers.
2293020	2296020	But pop, phasers was right there.
2297020	2302020	That's the only thing that's in Star Trek. Yeah, they don't have tasers.
2303020	2307020	I was trying to do double duty where I was like trying to rap like a rapper that hasn't seen Star Trek.
2308020	2309020	Freddy Krueger has razors.
2310020	2312020	Well, that's sick. Come on. Let's not.
2313020	2316020	This is not that segments over. We're not nitpicking my improv lyrics.
2317020	2320020	The okay, new segment. It's called sperm count questions.
2320020	2327020	Sperm count questions. Sperm count questions. Sperm count, you hear it a lot.
2328020	2334020	But what do you do when you got your sperm and it's being counted?
2335020	2347020	Sperm count questions. Sperm count questions.
2347020	2353020	Will you come on tonight? I've got a sperm count questions.
2361020	2365020	Dan, this is not a note, but sometimes you give me a look like you want me to kill the music.
2366020	2367020	Oh, okay.
2368020	2371020	And then I give you out in the music and then you then you go.
2372020	2373020	We should have a signal.
2374020	2376020	I thought you were saying and then out.
2377020	2378020	I don't know.
2379020	2381020	I'm just going off your lead.
2382020	2384020	I don't want to have a signal. I want this to be a fluid thing.
2385020	2386020	Usually it really is.
2387020	2390020	You guys, I'm always amazed that you know when to cut the music out.
2391020	2395020	But sometimes I blow it all the way. It's a fluid thing.
2396020	2397020	All right. Sperm count questions.
2398020	2400020	Do we ask you sperm count questions or do you have sperm count questions for us?
2401020	2402020	I have sperm count questions.
2403020	2404020	Oh, okay. I have one question.
2405020	2406020	What's a good number?
2407020	2408020	80, 80, 80.
2409020	2410020	I don't know.
2411020	2412020	80, 80.
2413020	2414020	It's 80, 80.
2415020	2416020	Oh yeah. My sperm's an 80, 80, bro.
2417020	2418020	I'm good.
2419020	2421020	You got 80 sperms out of 80 possibilities of sperms.
2422020	2423020	I got 80 out of 80 possible sperms.
2424020	2425020	Okay. So here's the thing about sperm count.
2426020	2427020	Here's the theory. Okay.
2428020	2434020	So I come and there's some sperm and then you take a needle and you and then you're like, you take a, you know,
2434020	2439020	you're, you're, you have some like sample size, like a cubic, cubic micron or whatever the fuck it is.
2440020	2441020	You're doing this?
2442020	2443020	No, I'm not doing it. Okay. Sorry.
2444020	2446020	A spermologist is doing it. Whatever the people that count your sperm.
2447020	2453020	So as far as I understand it, the idea is that what it is, is a, it's a, you know, it's like a ratio to amount of fluid, right?
2454020	2455020	I would assume so. Right?
2456020	2460020	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's density of usable shit in the jacket.
2461020	2463020	I would think it's like the sperm and not the semen.
2464020	2465020	What is his guest chair?
2466020	2467020	You know, it's the sperm.
2468020	2470020	A gentleman is raising his hand over here. Do you know the answer to this?
2471020	2472020	We do know the answer. It's not like how many you have.
2473020	2474020	Can you get up and grab a mic real quick?
2475020	2476020	You'll have to come up and talk about sperm. Sorry.
2479020	2481020	Sperm count answers.
2483020	2485020	The same thing happens in Nightmare on Elm Street part two.
2486020	2487020	There's this whole scene in biology class.
2488020	2489020	I just spent 20 minutes talking about sperm now.
2490020	2492020	All right. What's your name, young man? Have you been up here before?
2492020	2494020	I have. It's Scoota. Scoota. Oh.
2495020	2496020	How can I forget?
2497020	2498020	How do you spell it?
2499020	2500020	S-K-U-T-A. Okay. Yeah.
2501020	2504020	All right, Scoota. So I don't know why, but I learned it recently, I believe.
2505020	2509020	So the sperm count, you have like the sample and then they have like a,
2510020	2514020	I don't know if they use real eggs or not, but what they count is how many make it
2515020	2516020	to the egg. Wait, really?
2517020	2518020	Like in a simulated race track?
2519020	2521020	How many viable sperm make it through an actual...
2522020	2525020	Egg. Because like some like, like sometimes like alcohol use or some drug use
2526020	2528020	makes your sperm like kind of lazy. Sure.
2529020	2531020	Tell me about it. Wait, Scoota, wait.
2532020	2534020	So you'd have like a smaller count because less would make it to the egg.
2535020	2537020	Okay. Where is the egg that they're using in the counting?
2538020	2539020	I don't know. It's a lady.
2542020	2544020	It's Martha. It's also the same lady. It's the same lady for all of us.
2545020	2547020	It's one lady. She's old now.
2548020	2550020	She just has a window in her, in her like ovaries. Yeah.
2551020	2554020	She's like a cow at the state fair that you can watch Grass Digest,
2555020	2558020	but there's like, they put, they put, they put semen and then they come.
2559020	2560020	It will be back in six hours, Gloria. And she's like, okay.
2561020	2562020	And she puts on headphones.
2566020	2568020	What song is playing? I was a highwayman.
2570020	2571020	Drop of rain.
2573020	2576020	But then they come back in and they, and they, I mean, seriously, come on.
2577020	2578020	Now this is, this raises 90 more questions.
2578020	2579020	How do you count?
2580020	2583020	Scooter, you're saying they're using actual viable eggs and creating a situation
2584020	2586020	where the sperm, they would find out how much.
2587020	2590020	Yeah. They basically, it's like the active sperm you have versus bullshit,
2591020	2592020	deadbeat, never going to make it.
2593020	2594020	Organizer race.
2595020	2596020	And they see how many make the finish line.
2598020	2599020	Sperm race. Yeah.
2600020	2602020	Well, all of my questions about sperm count have to do with how they do it.
2603020	2604020	So, I mean, that's an interesting.
2605020	2606020	Can anybody else verify or deny?
2606020	2608020	Is it like a male? What is it like?
2609020	2610020	Michael, get the fuck up here.
2611020	2612020	Michael knows more sperm answers.
2617020	2618020	Welcome to sperm in town.
2619020	2620020	How's it going?
2621020	2622020	Also, I could have Googled it.
2623020	2625020	Yeah. I think we both read the same Reddit post.
2626020	2627020	Scooter.
2628020	2630020	Yeah. There was a post recently about how when you smoke marijuana,
2631020	2632020	it makes your sperm have less motility.
2633020	2634020	So they get lazy.
2634020	2638020	And so how they measure it is just like literally watch them move.
2639020	2640020	And they travel away from a point.
2641020	2642020	So they just look at a microscope.
2643020	2644020	They literally just measure. They pick a radius.
2645020	2647020	It's like, and they don't care what direction they go.
2648020	2649020	Oh, they went pretty far. Okay.
2650020	2652020	But how, okay. But, but, but okay.
2653020	2655020	So, so, so let's say I come.
2656020	2657020	Oh yeah.
2658020	2659020	Easy, Michael.
2660020	2661020	I'm sorry.
2662020	2663020	I do a microscope slide.
2664020	2665020	Um, with a picture of a redhead on it.
2666020	2667020	Yeah.
2670020	2673020	Uh, and you put it under the microscope and now you see, well,
2674020	2677020	you're going to see like a random number of, of sperm.
2678020	2680020	They have, they have to like, they, do they have a set number?
2681020	2682020	So is the, is the sperm counts?
2683020	2687020	I always have a count was the amount of like spermatozilla per like,
2688020	2689020	that's what I thought, like density.
2690020	2691020	Well, it's not, is it?
2692020	2693020	What's your name?
2694020	2695020	Yeah, I will sacrifice.
2696020	2697020	Scoot it. Scoot it. You're gone.
2698020	2699020	Scoot it. Scoot.
2700020	2702020	This is like the worst game show ever.
2705020	2708020	And the prize is going to be the worst prize.
2709020	2710020	What's your name, sir?
2711020	2712020	Will. Okay.
2713020	2714020	And so they actually measure several things.
2715020	2717020	But one thing is sperm count, which is the number of sperm per volume.
2718020	2719020	Okay. They also measure motility.
2720020	2721020	That's called the SPV, right?
2721020	2723020	Okay. Sperm count. Sperm count.
2724020	2726020	But then they do have motility, which is how many of them are moving well.
2727020	2728020	Okay. Like a percentage of how many are moving well.
2729020	2730020	All right. So sperm count.
2731020	2732020	There's morphology also. What is that?
2733020	2734020	Which is how many look defective.
2735020	2736020	How many actually look odd?
2737020	2738020	Do you want it to make it to the egg?
2739020	2742020	Yeah. I don't, I don't, I don't care about anything but sperm count.
2743020	2745020	Because, because you always hear these statistics about, oh,
2746020	2747020	the average sperm count's gone down or this loads your sperm.
2748020	2749020	I just want to know how do they count sperm?
2749020	2755020	Like, like, like, because if it's per volume, is that, so that's per a set volume.
2756020	2761020	So, so the thing is like, like, like, what, so it's not, it's not like,
2762020	2765020	it's not like our, our, our, forgive me, ladies, cover your ears.
2766020	2768020	It's not like my balls have a bunch of cum in them and, and like,
2769020	2770020	including the sperm and then it's like a bag of liquid.
2771020	2772020	Also, man, close your ears too.
2773020	2776020	Yeah. And then, and then, and then it all comes out like it's, like,
2776020	2780020	it's, like, it's, it's like my, my, my balls are making sperm cells.
2781020	2785020	The, the liquid is that, that makes up a majority of the semen.
2786020	2787020	It comes from some other place in my body.
2788020	2789020	Prostate.
2790020	2791020	And the seminal vesicle.
2792020	2794020	There we go. Don't forget the Cowper's gland.
2795020	2799020	What about, isn't, isn't, is it vas deferent?
2800020	2801020	The vas deferent.
2802020	2803020	Vas deferent.
2803020	2806020	So, so what volume are they taking when you come?
2809020	2812020	Is there a joke that's like there's a vas deferent between sperm and semen?
2813020	2814020	You just made it. You just made it.
2815020	2816020	Is that, you just made it.
2817020	2818020	There's no way that's the first time.
2819020	2820020	No. I wish you guys would take this seriously.
2821020	2824020	They, they take a measured amount and they just count them.
2825020	2827020	But they take what out of the wad that comes out, sorry, ladies,
2828020	2831020	the fucking cloudy wad, the fucking, like, it's like part, there's like,
2831020	2833020	it looks like the earth in there.
2834020	2835020	It looks like there's like North America and Australia.
2836020	2837020	There's like on your bathroom floor.
2838020	2840020	I mean, how do you, there's like, you know what gum looks like.
2841020	2843020	Like there's like, there's like, it doesn't, it doesn't look like glue.
2844020	2845020	It looks like fucking.
2846020	2849020	Dino, our friend who we all know very well from his shady encounters.
2850020	2852020	He was, did he talk about him being a sperm donor for a while?
2853020	2854020	Yeah, Dino was.
2855020	2856020	Yeah. And he was, but he, did we discuss that in the show?
2857020	2859020	So he would go in there and like donate sperm all the time.
2859020	2861020	So Dino may have countless children out there.
2862020	2863020	We have no idea.
2864020	2865020	That's terrifying.
2866020	2872020	And the woman that ran the sperm counter, counter, the counter where you put your sperm on to have it counted.
2873020	2874020	Yes.
2875020	2876020	She would look at it and go, get the fucking back in there.
2877020	2878020	Like, this is just water.
2879020	2880020	Like you, like, you, like, you, like, you've been jerking off too much.
2881020	2885020	Come back when you haven't jerked off all fucking day long and bring me some actual, like, cum.
2886020	2887020	She, she would, she could talk by looking at it.
2887020	2888020	She's like, we can't do anything with this.
2889020	2891020	All right. So that kind of goes to my point, I guess.
2892020	2897020	The, the, like, the, the idea, I mean, this is not a, this is an organic, like, I still don't, I don't understand this idea that you can scientifically look.
2898020	2900020	It's a solution. It's not like one constant thing.
2901020	2905020	So in the solution, there's some stuff that's sperm, that's swimming sperm and some stuff that supports it.
2906020	2907020	But sometimes, okay.
2908020	2909020	They measure a set amount of volume.
2910020	2911020	Okay. So, so here's, okay. So here's my follow up question.
2913020	2914020	Please, sir. Simmer down.
2914020	2915020	We'll get to you in a moment.
2916020	2917020	That's Beefsteak Bill, I believe.
2918020	2919020	What do you do, Will? What's your job?
2920020	2921020	Beefsteak Bill, I work for a health insurance company.
2922020	2924020	Okay. So my, so I think I'm starting to get this.
2925020	2930020	I'm, what I'm deducing from this is that when you, forgive me, ladies, just, I'll be with you in one moment.
2931020	2935020	When you come, like, you're coming like a random amount of fluid.
2936020	2941020	Like, like, like, like, like sometimes, you know, it's like, you know, it's like a little bit.
2941020	2942020	And sometimes it's a lot.
2943020	2944020	Sometimes it's just dust.
2945020	2947020	I can't use this. Come back.
2948020	2949020	And so I'm assuming.
2950020	2952020	Camille, we're going to table that comment until a little later.
2953020	2962020	And so I'm assuming, like, that that, what that means is that the amount of fluid that comes out of your wiener when you have an orgasm has nothing to do.
2963020	2969020	It's, that's like just a, that's just fluid that your sperm count, even on a bad day or a bad, bad day,
2970020	2981020	meaning like less fluid coming out of your wiener, like during an orgasm, that that would have the same sperm count as Wednesday when you're like, whoa, it took me a long time and whoo.
2982020	2984020	Like, and it's like, wow, look at all that.
2985020	2988020	But it's like, same sperm, still, still three, three per drop, though.
2989020	2991020	Can I ask you a probably what might be a personal backstory question?
2992020	2993020	Are you going in regularly to a?
2994020	2997020	No, I'm asking this because I'm just curious about how they count sperm.
2998020	3000020	No, this is not, there's nothing personal about it.
3001020	3003020	And it shouldn't have taken this long. I just want to know how they count sperm.
3004020	3005020	Have you already gone in and tried this? Or this is, this is.
3006020	3007020	No, I just, it just said no.
3008020	3009020	Okay, so I'm sorry, I totally.
3010020	3011020	Dan, have you gone in to the.
3012020	3015020	I don't know why I'm so frustrated with you guys tonight.
3016020	3017020	It's got to be me.
3018020	3021020	I honestly really thought that you, like, this is something that you've gone in and tried multiple times.
3022020	3024020	The way that you started talking about it sounded like.
3024020	3027020	No, because you know, I just stuff about it. I don't, I don't, I don't.
3028020	3037020	He's just curious. And I think your question is when it, when it's a lot or when it's a little, is it still the same number of sperm and it's just more liquid or is it the same density? Hence more sperm.
3038020	3039020	Yes. On better days. Yes.
3040020	3042020	Yes. So how do they like, I couldn't tell you that.
3043020	3045020	I mean, it should only read read it just mathematically.
3046020	3051020	Yeah. It should just average out to the point that they could do science and determine what's good or bad.
3051020	3057020	So each man is walking around with a certain amount of sperm that he sets to the task whenever he ejaculates.
3058020	3061020	And, but, but it always happens with a random amount of fluid.
3062020	3066020	And that, that sample of sperm might be lazy, weirdo sperm.
3067020	3068020	So they might be, they might be good ones.
3069020	3074020	And when they're counting them, they're not worried about that. They'll go like, well, you got a very high sperm count, but they all look like Greg Allman.
3075020	3076020	Yeah.
3077020	3079020	Four tails, you know, it works.
3080020	3082020	All right. Well, let's thank our sperm panel.
3087020	3088020	Come again.
3090020	3093020	Hey, you forgot your drink. You forgot it.
3094020	3095020	Not you guys. You're good.
3096020	3098020	Michael sperm and Will sperm. Thank you. Scooted sperm.
3101020	3102020	That scoot is a looker, huh?
3103020	3103020	
3103020	3104020	He's a handsome young man.
3109020	3111020	He could be in a nightmare on Elm Street movie.
3113020	3115020	Are we connecting dots right now?
3116020	3118020	Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I want to count my sperm.
3120020	3121020	I don't know what we're, I don't know what we're.
3122020	3123020	And I want scooter to do all the counting.
3124020	3130020	If I wanted to have a baby with a, with a, with a woman and raise it with a man, well, how would my sperm count matter?
3133020	3135020	Dan, why is that on your mind? Is that, is that because?
3136020	3137020	It's just random. Why is anything, it's just.
3138020	3139020	Is it because you're thinking of child rearing?
3140020	3146020	I think it's because he was thinking that sometimes he comes a lot and then sometimes he comes a little and he's like, well, how does that work when they're counting it?
3147020	3150020	I guess that's probably what it popped in my head today when I jerked off. Yeah.
3151020	3154020	It's also like, oh, and I was like, oh, that's a little felt good though.
3155020	3156020	But it's also.
3157020	3161020	And then I was like, and then I was like laying there going to sleep on a nice summer afternoon. I was like, ah, it feels good.
3162020	3166020	I wonder if it feels better when there's more liquid that comes out or when there's more sperm coming out.
3167020	3168020	That's interesting. And you said this.
3169020	3176020	And then I thought, well, there's probably, there's probably not a variation in the sperm because there's, there's sperm count and they like, and then that's why I thought so.
3177020	3179020	I, you said this, it is interesting. This is going to be so gross.
3180020	3183020	But if you take longer, there's more that comes out.
3184020	3187020	Is it like your body like, sort of like, he worked hard for this.
3189020	3190020	Give him more. Yeah.
3191020	3192020	I mean, it's weird. It's so weird.
3193020	3195020	That's our bodies are weird. Well, we had that anthropologist guy, doctor.
3196020	3208020	What's his name? The guy who's never remember anyone's name, but that guy who was like the punk rock anthropologist, who's one of his big theories that people know him for is that the human penis has a, has a head on it because it's, it's a plunger.
3209020	3215020	It's supposed to like, you know, scrape out, suck out, like, like, like, like pull back like the previous competitors.
3216020	3217020	Oh dear.
3218020	3220020	I don't think that does not happen.
3221020	3224020	I don't think when I have sex, there's more sperm in my penis.
3225020	3229020	Well, he's saying, get that other guy that just fucked her up before me, get it, remove his stuff.
3230020	3232020	But into your penis. Not into your penis now.
3236020	3238020	How do you, I thought it's like, that's called the syringe.
3239020	3241020	Get it, get it, get it, eat it, and then mine.
3244020	3246020	That would be amazing.
3247020	3254020	That would be so amazing. If that's like the pinnacle of human competitiveness, it's like, it's like, now your comes in my dick.
3256020	3257020	That's how straight I am.
3260020	3262020	In my dreams, you're still the same.
3265020	3268020	So his thing is that the head scrape takes out all the other.
3269020	3274020	It's like a plunger, like, you know, like what, like you're creating suction on the way out.
3275020	3276020	I think it's pulling back.
3279020	3284020	Animals probably had that, and then it evolved less and less, but it's probably a remnant of that, I'd imagine.
3285020	3297020	It could be, who knows. I mean, it's, I think what's interesting is actually, like, I think the important thing about anthropology is not proving things, but actually, actually coming up with crazy theories because, like, we are basing all of our understanding on humanity on crazy theories.
3298020	3306020	We don't regularly get disproved. Like, in 1995, we found out a bunch of shit that they're still teaching in high schools that's based on 50s understanding of anthropology.
3307020	3321020	It all fell apart in 95, but they still teach the same thing, which is basically that we were apes and trees and that we, that there was some kind of climatic change that put us onto the plains in the savannah environment, and that's why we started walking up right and all this stuff.
3321020	3331020	No, no, that's been proven false. I mean, it's been proven very, very unlikely, if not actually proven false by analyzing, like, the food that we ate at certain times in our evolutionary.
3331020	3347020	Anyways, so we're never going to know anything because we're trying to dig up our own bones and, like, figure out, like, at what point did we stop being monkeys and start being these amazing specimens?
3353020	3355020	I like that half-assed flourish.
3356020	3364020	All right, so, it was an actual, I was playing the Mad Max video game all day today.
3365020	3369020	And you liked this game. I thought you had a very funny tweet about it, about the dog.
3370020	3375020	Yeah, well, thank you. I mean, it was an actual, just, like, my dogs are going insane from the fucking...
3376020	3377020	I thought it was very funny.
3378020	3381020	I had to go clear the minefields because there's a dog in the game that, like, barks when you're near a mine, and the dog...
3382020	3384020	Is it a game based on the most recent film?
3385020	3387020	No, they were making it before that movie got greenlit.
3389020	3393020	But then they kind of put, like, a bunch of Fury Road kind of stuff in it, too.
3394020	3396020	Like, the title, I think is good.
3397020	3405020	But, yeah, the dogs, like, so the dogs, like, obviously what's happening is, like, you know, they recorded a dog, a real dog.
3405020	3411020	And they don't know what the, they're just having the dog bark, and then having the dog growl, and then having the dog, like, do different kinds of barks.
3412020	3415020	Because you're using the different kinds of barks to find the mines that you have to defuse.
3416020	3420020	So, obviously, the dog is saying something like, like, my name's Roger! Hey! Hey, I'm over here! My name's Roger!
3421020	3424020	Like, or something, who knows what it's saying? Like, it could be, I don't know how they got the dog to bark.
3425020	3429020	They might have, like, shown it a picture of a cat, so it's going like, everybody, look at this cat! This cat! There's a cat in front of me!
3430020	3431020	My name's Steve! My name's Steve! I'm a dog! I'm looking at a cat!
3432020	3442020	But at any rate, like, the dogs are just like, because if there was, if there was a video game, but you didn't know what video games were, and you just all of a sudden, you heard some guy in your house going, going like, hey, hey, happy birthday! Happy birthday!
3443020	3446020	I had a birthday once! My name's Mike! My name's Mike! It's my birthday, too!
3447020	3455020	You'd also do the dog equivalent, the human equivalent of what the dogs are doing, which is, like, not bark, but you'd, like, grab a butcher knife, or, like, go, you're gonna go, right.
3456020	3464020	So the dogs are, like, they're freaking out, and Harvey already, like, he freaks out when he sees dogs, then he sees the dog in the Max car, like, barking at the bombs, and he's just freaking out.
3465020	3479020	But then, over time, they got used to it, so they think that's very, dogs, they understand, like, they started to figure out it was a recording, because that's why they don't react every time music comes on, they're not like, where's Beck? Why is Beck in the house?
3480020	3497020	Like, do you ever notice in animals, they don't freak out as much as they should about, like, TV and music, like, when it's just playing, like, given how freaking out they get when they hear, like, a raccoon a block away, like, scratch its ass, like, they're, like, rrrr, rrrr, or when there's a ghost in your closet?
3500020	3504020	You know it. You've seen it. Don't act all scientific.
3504020	3512020	Do you think your dog, when it sees a dog on TV, is like, oh, that's, that's a dog?
3513020	3528020	I don't know, because the, they change, like, why does the dog, like, but Nigel doesn't do it. Nigel's, Nigel reacts to the barking sounds, like, in stuff, but he doesn't, he doesn't watch TV. Harvey watches TV, and if he sees a dog or Danny DeVito, he, like, freaks out.
3529020	3532020	And that's not a joke, like, Danny DeVito, like, like, like, he...
3533020	3534020	Because he cuts the silhouettes.
3535020	3540020	I got, like, like, like, like, like, late, late, late, late, always sunny, but then I, well, that's what I thought, because I was like, oh, he gets scruffier.
3541020	3542020	You should try, like, different versions.
3543020	3549020	But then he was barking at the iTunes menu, and it was the Rainmaker movie, the key art. He's walking next to Matt Damon with a briefcase, and he's like, rrrr, rrr, rrr, I'm like, it's fucking DeVito.
3550020	3555020	You should try Batman Returns to see if in the penguin makeup, if he still barks.
3556020	3557020	If he still barks.
3558020	3562020	Yeah, but honestly, the novelties weren't off of me. Now it's just terror, because it means your dog can read.
3563020	3569020	I don't understand, like, he does it, because it cuts, like, does he think that he's looking you through a magic window that's always changing?
3570020	3576020	I think he's probably just reacting to very simple stimulus, like, the sound of something, and he realizes, okay, that's only sound, there's no smell to that, like, it's not connecting from the energy level.
3577020	3578020	Right, I bet smell is a big way.
3578020	3588020	So, I'm hearing a noise, but I'm not connecting it to a thing, or I'm smelling something, but where's the visual, like, I would guess that it's very simple little stimuli. Maybe?
3589020	3590020	I don't know, man, because I think it is.
3591020	3592020	Scoot it, get back up here.
3593020	3601020	I mean, you could say that about anything, honestly, with any animal, including us, but the thing is, like, he sees the dog on the screen, and then forget about barking.
3602020	3609020	Just like we're watching a cartoon where a dog loves cereal, and it's like a cartoon dog walking on its hind legs.
3610020	3616020	Shrab's dog, by the way, does this with the family guy, that dog, like, his dog recognizes as a dog and starts freaking out.
3617020	3619020	It looks like a coffee mug, it doesn't even look like a dog.
3620020	3624020	It's like an artistic expression of the idea of a dog, and the dog's like, yeah, that's a dog.
3625020	3630020	What we've done to dogs, like, canis familiaris, like, domesticated dogs, is we've made them...
3631020	3632020	What did you call them?
3633020	3635020	Canis familiaris, I believe, is the species, right? Am I getting that right?
3636020	3637020	That's all dogs that are at home?
3638020	3639020	That's what we call, like, our domesticated dogs, like, not wolves.
3640020	3642020	Ironically, when you're on unfamiliar terms with them.
3645020	3646020	That's pretty close.
3647020	3648020	It's as familiar as you're going to get with a canis.
3649020	3651020	It's the best case of scenario-ists.
3652020	3656020	But, like, we breed certain dogs for herding, so, like, if you have a German...
3657020	3663020	Or, like, an Australian shepherd, and you walk them down the road, they bark at cars moving, because they want to herd, like, moving things next to you.
3664020	3665020	They want to move things out of...
3666020	3670020	Other dogs are about burrowing, other dogs are about sheltering, other dogs are about just straight at protection.
3671020	3674020	So we've bred them to do very specific tasks.
3675020	3676020	And now Harvey is...
3676020	3677020	What do you think those...
3678020	3679020	A golden retriever and a poodle?
3680020	3682020	What are those wiener dogs for? Do you think they're for, like, cleaning the insides of canons?
3685020	3686020	The fluffy little dogs?
3687020	3689020	I asked a guy that on the sidewalk...
3690020	3692020	We have to get inside this cannon, but I won't go in there.
3693020	3696020	I told this story on the show, I'm sure, because I asked that of a guy on the sidewalk.
3697020	3698020	I was looking at his little dog, and I was like...
3699020	3703020	I was like, oh, I never noticed, like, you see cartoons of these things, or you see them in movies, and, like...
3703020	3707020	But I just realized, it's a regular sized dog, but it's just, like, it's a dwarf.
3708020	3713020	It has, like, little tiny stunted legs.
3714020	3716020	And I was just, like, marveling at it.
3717020	3718020	I was like, huh, we really did a number on these things.
3719020	3720020	Like, what...
3721020	3722020	You know, every dog has, like, a thing.
3723020	3724020	What do you think these things are for?
3725020	3726020	Like, going back to, what was their purpose?
3727020	3731020	And, like, it's sometimes me rambling, because it was a friend of, like, Ridley's or something that he was just talking to.
3732020	3733020	And I was just, like, kind of...
3734020	3735020	Shitting on his dog.
3736020	3737020	I don't know, I guess I was like...
3738020	3745020	And then, like, halfway through my questions about the dog breed, he was like, I don't know, I didn't invent him, I just own him.
3746020	3747020	Wow.
3748020	3750020	Like, he was kind of defensive, like, I guess it felt like I was accusing him of eugenics or something.
3751020	3752020	I feel like they're good.
3752020	3762020	A lot of the really extreme, like, breeds that, like, they are, like, like, like, porgies and, like, I think, like, the wiener dogs, whatever they call those, and, like, and, like, giant dogs, those have been...
3763020	3765020	We have made those extreme by breeding those just for looks.
3766020	3767020	That's just fashion.
3768020	3770020	Yeah, and, like, the 1800s, it's just, like, rich British people going, like, I want to...
3771020	3779020	If you took a British bulldog back when it was actually more like the actual dog, it kind of was bred to be, like, naturally, it was a much more effective, like, healthy dog.
3779020	3781020	And now we've taken that dog and made it way less healthy.
3782020	3784020	And Sharpay's are just, you know, riddled with disease.
3785020	3787020	German Shepherds, there's no reason why the spines are curved like that.
3788020	3791020	What's the dog that has, like, the alcohol to save people in the snow?
3792020	3793020	Saint Bernard.
3794020	3795020	In cartoons?
3795020	3796020	Saint Bernard.
3796020	3797020	Snoop Dogg.
3797020	3798020	And that's what that's for.
3798020	3799020	Yeah.
3799020	3800020	And you know, you know they sew those...
3803020	3804020	They sew those barrels to their necks.
3805020	3806020	Oh, no.
3806020	3807020	They're born with them now.
3808020	3809020	It's really inhumane.
3810020	3812020	I think wiener dogs chase rats.
3813020	3814020	I think that's why they're bred.
3815020	3823020	Terriers, like, little rat terriers, their legs are small so they can get through little holes, and they kept rats off your farm and out of your grain so that you could sell your shit without them.
3824020	3830020	And they have a heavy, heavy, like, relative to dogs, a huge, like, they're diagnosable OCD, the terriers.
3831020	3832020	Oh, really?
3832020	3835020	Like Jack Russell's in particular, like, because they're such good rodent dogs.
3836020	3837020	They've bred...
3837020	3838020	Now they've bred...
3838020	3841020	It's like they're obsessed with detail.
3841020	3844020	They're obsessed with holes, electrical outlets, corners of the coffee table.
3845020	3847020	If they start licking your face, they can't stop, you know?
3848020	3849020	And they hear minute scratches.
3849020	3857020	The always thing, like, my friend has a Jack Russell terrier, and it's like, do we live in a house full of ghosts because this dog is hearing something at all times and trying to burrow through the wall?
3858020	3859020	He's just a burrower.
3859020	3863020	So by that logic, your dog was maybe bred to fight Danny DeVito.
3865020	3869020	And there's some guy who hates Danny DeVito who's like, I fucking bred this dog.
3869020	3870020	I don't know where it went.
3870020	3872020	Or maybe just bring him to me.
3874020	3875020	Yeah, he's in Hollywood.
3875020	3877020	Maybe he'll run into Danny DeVito at some point.
3878020	3879020	He just gets...
3879020	3884020	Yeah, he gets out of the yard for three days, he comes back, and Danny DeVito's just in his mouth.
3884020	3885020	Forty years ago...
3886020	3887020	Forty years ago...
3887020	3888020	I'm so sorry, sir.
3890020	3892020	Let me call you an Uber.
3894020	3895020	It's a golden doodle.
3895020	3896020	No.
3896020	3897020	I understand.
3897020	3898020	I get it all the time.
3898020	3899020	I get it all the time.
3899020	3900020	He's like, this is the fifth time this happened to me.
3900020	3902020	It happens like three times a week.
3902020	3909020	And I hope you won't take this personally, but I'm leading the charge on legislation against these animals.
3913020	3914020	Danny DeVito seems awesome.
3914020	3915020	Just a side note.
3915020	3918020	Every story you hear about him would confirm that.
3918020	3920020	He sounds fun by all counts.
3921020	3923020	Danny DeVito slipped through the cracks.
3923020	3924020	The highway men?
3924020	3925020	Not so lucky.
3927020	3928020	Nightmare on Elm Street 2?
3931020	3933020	You're a little competitive tonight, Dan.
3933020	3935020	I feel like you're coming in loaded for bear.
3935020	3937020	You want to win these arguments as opposed to...
3937020	3939020	Maybe it's because I was playing Mad Max all day.
3939020	3940020	Because I was playing Mad Max.
3940020	3942020	I wasn't what I was going to say.
3942020	3947020	I am getting into the game now, and it's like you're doing a lot of car combat.
3947020	3950020	So I was kind of going like, what a lovely day.
3950020	3951020	What a lovely day.
3953020	3957020	And then at like six o'clock I bothered to go outside to play fetch with the dogs.
3957020	3959020	And it was like, oh shit, what a lovely day.
3962020	3963020	It's 9-11.
3963020	3966020	What a lovely day.
3968020	3969020	What a lovely day.
3970020	3972020	What wasn't a lovely day?
3973020	3974020	The opposite of a lovely day.
3974020	3975020	9-11.
3976020	3979020	I mean meteorologically it was a lovely day.
3979020	3981020	Okay, let's move off.
3984020	3988020	We can't be like, listen, silver lining, it was a gorgeous...
3988020	3990020	It was like 79 degrees.
3990020	3992020	The sun was out, yeah, light breeze was great.
3992020	3995020	I mean it could not have happened on a more beautiful day.
3997020	3998020	I can't say any of that.
4001020	4003020	What else do you have on your list?
4004020	4007020	I thought maybe we should check in with you because we don't see you anymore.
4007020	4008020	So what's been going on?
4008020	4011020	Your show is doing well, everyone loves it.
4011020	4015020	You're shooting movies now in all kinds of places.
4016020	4020020	The thing I was most excited about was I did an episode of X-Files.
4023020	4030020	That was the one that I was really truly very very nervous about and very very excited.
4030020	4034020	Can we know what your role was or is that a disclosure that you're not allowed to?
4034020	4040020	No, I don't think I could say, but it's not a huge role, but it's not tiny either.
4040020	4042020	I saw a photo, you were dressed in some sort of official outfit?
4042020	4043020	Yeah.
4043020	4045020	You were allowed to post that or you're not allowed to?
4045020	4049020	Yeah, I'm an animal control officer because that's what it says on my badge, so I guess.
4049020	4051020	I think they were maybe annoyed that I...
4051020	4054020	But you know, it's the X-Files, there's animal control officers.
4055020	4059020	But it was crazy because I honestly...
4059020	4063020	I found out two months before I did it and I was like, I didn't tell anybody,
4063020	4066020	I didn't watch a single episode because I was freaked out.
4066020	4070020	And then when I landed, I was like, fine.
4070020	4073020	I was like, I worked on the scenes, I was like, I'm not going to be nervous.
4073020	4079020	And then when they picked me up, they gave me a folder and it said Kumail Nanjiani X-Files welcome folder.
4079020	4082020	And it was Mulder's like, I want to believe poster,
4082020	4085020	but instead of I want to believe it was my name.
4085020	4086020	And that's what I called Emily.
4086020	4088020	I was like, Emily, I'm freaking out a little bit right now.
4088020	4090020	You need to talk me down.
4090020	4091020	What did you mean?
4091020	4093020	You said you didn't watch a single episode.
4093020	4097020	I didn't watch for two months before because I'd known for two months I was going to do it.
4097020	4098020	Right.
4098020	4099020	Because I didn't want to start freaking out.
4099020	4103020	You didn't want to have too much information about the show you were going to be on.
4103020	4105020	Or be too much of a nervous fanboy.
4105020	4109020	Yeah, I just wanted it to be a job and not like,
4109020	4110020	fucking dream.
4110020	4112020	I never dared dream coming true.
4112020	4113020	You know, that makes sense.
4113020	4115020	See, that's why I'm not an actor.
4115020	4116020	Actors that were ever on it and all that.
4116020	4118020	I wouldn't even have had that common sense.
4118020	4120020	I would have been like, oh, I should.
4120020	4124020	I should watch every episode twice so that I really know the tone of the show.
4124020	4126020	And then I'd be like to be or not to be.
4126020	4127020	What are you doing?
4127020	4129020	I'm like, well, I watch the show.
4129020	4130020	I know the show super well.
4130020	4134020	So that wasn't the but I had to sort of like pretend to be cooler on them.
4134020	4138020	Like, oh, hello, David Jillian.
4138020	4140020	Nice to meet you.
4140020	4143020	Did you get to work closely with those two?
4143020	4144020	Yeah.
4144020	4147020	That's great.
4147020	4149020	He loves to cool there a little bit.
4149020	4151020	Yeah.
4151020	4153020	Because I didn't just talk to...
4153020	4156020	Scooter, take a sperm count on that just now.
4156020	4158020	It skyrocketed.
4158020	4161020	It's 150, 80.
4161020	4163020	Wow.
4163020	4164020	That's a very rare thing.
4164020	4167020	I had this moment where I didn't just meet...
4167020	4169020	I had a scene with them.
4169020	4170020	I had a couple scenes with...
4170020	4172020	Well, I had scenes with them.
4172020	4176020	It's very hard for me to talk about without getting teary-eyed.
4176020	4178020	Don't be shy.
4178020	4180020	So I had this moment where I was like, I didn't...
4180020	4183020	Because I was talking to Jillian Anderson, David Duchovny,
4183020	4186020	and I kind of like, you know, I was with them for three days.
4186020	4189020	And then during one of the scenes, I was like,
4189020	4192020	oh, I'm talking to Mulder and Scully now.
4193020	4196020	I didn't just talk to David Duchovny and Jillian Anderson.
4196020	4198020	I talked to Mulder and Scully.
4198020	4199020	With the haircuts and the...
4199020	4201020	With the haircuts and the everything.
4201020	4203020	And the cell phones and the...
4203020	4204020	Flashlights.
4204020	4206020	And the simmering sexual tension.
4206020	4208020	Yeah, it was great.
4208020	4210020	I hope I'm good in it.
4210020	4213020	Usually when I do a job, I'm like, oh, I did well.
4213020	4214020	Or that wasn't as good.
4214020	4215020	This one, I have no idea.
4215020	4217020	I could be horrible enough.
4217020	4220020	I'm a failure as a fan because I don't even know the details.
4220020	4222020	Is Chris Carter running it?
4222020	4224020	And are a lot of the old writers back?
4224020	4225020	Or is he...
4225020	4226020	A lot of them are back.
4226020	4227020	Not Vince Gilligan.
4227020	4228020	But my...
4228020	4229020	Why not?
4229020	4230020	Why not Vince Gilligan?
4230020	4233020	He just was at home, you know, hanging out.
4236020	4239020	The episode was written and directed by my favorite X-Files writer,
4239020	4240020	Darren Morgan.
4240020	4241020	Darren Morgan.
4241020	4242020	Yeah.
4242020	4243020	Is that the guy that did the Jose...
4243020	4244020	Yeah.
4244020	4246020	That's the guy that did that one in Clyde Bruckman's final repository.
4246020	4247020	Spencer, are you a big X-Files fan?
4247020	4248020	Nope.
4248020	4250020	I just listened to the podcast.
4250020	4252020	Probably everybody that listens to our podcast knows
4252020	4254020	Kumail is a podcast called the X-Files Files.
4254020	4256020	And he talks to, like, lots of...
4256020	4257020	Yeah.
4257020	4259020	I mean, this has to be the best case scenario.
4259020	4262020	Do you start a podcast about something you love?
4262020	4263020	Do you...
4263020	4266020	I mean, were you hired because you're a successful actor right now?
4266020	4268020	Or because you have that podcast or a mixture of both?
4268020	4270020	Or is there one more thing?
4270020	4273020	I mean, they clearly were like, it'll mean so much to this guy.
4273020	4275020	That's great.
4275020	4276020	And it does.
4276020	4277020	Yeah, they were...
4277020	4280020	I want to start a podcast called Vivian Westwood Suits.
4280020	4281020	Yeah.
4281020	4284020	That's actually a smart move for, like, not a huge part,
4284020	4286020	but, like, an important part.
4286020	4288020	Because I'm thinking as a producer, I'd be like,
4288020	4290020	well, this guy's not going to complain if we go overtime.
4290020	4291020	Oh, yeah.
4291020	4292020	I was like, I'm here.
4292020	4293020	What do you guys need?
4293020	4295020	I can serve the food, whatever you want.
4295020	4297020	We need you to get into makeup and then just sit.
4297020	4300020	We're going to shoot you whenever the other actors are busy.
4300020	4301020	Okay, all right.
4301020	4302020	Yeah, okay.
4302020	4303020	So, Kumail, you said you were having me.
4303020	4305020	I want to go back to what you said earlier.
4305020	4308020	Like you say, sometimes you walk away from having shot something
4308020	4310020	and you go, nailed it, or sucked.
4310020	4312020	But you have, like, you...
4312020	4314020	I have zero sense...
4314020	4316020	Was your memory just completely overblown?
4316020	4317020	No, I remember every single moment.
4317020	4321020	I just was like, I don't know if I'm good in this or...
4321020	4324020	It was hard, because it's also outside of my, like, I don't...
4324020	4326020	I haven't done sci-fi or horror stuff.
4326020	4327020	Was it heavy lifting?
4327020	4329020	Did you have, like, a lot of emotional range stuff to go through?
4329020	4330020	Or was it pretty...
4330020	4333020	It wasn't, like, a fully easy part.
4333020	4334020	Like, it was kind of hard.
4334020	4336020	Like, there was...
4336020	4340020	I had to, like, do stuff instead of just, like, crack-wise.
4340020	4342020	Yeah.
4342020	4344020	So, it was a hard part.
4344020	4346020	Did you labor over the rehearsal, like, at home?
4346020	4347020	Oh, my God.
4347020	4349020	I worked on it so much.
4349020	4352020	I worked on it so much.
4352020	4354020	And that's why it's hard to know, like, I don't know...
4354020	4357020	Well, then when you get there and you worked on it really hard,
4357020	4360020	then it's just noises that you're making and you have...
4360020	4361020	It's candy.
4361020	4362020	Oh, shit.
4362020	4363020	Yeah.
4363020	4364020	I saw...
4364020	4365020	Alan Wu.
4365020	4368020	Alan Wu, who probably became a director because he loves attention.
4368020	4369020	He loves...
4369020	4370020	Do you know Alan?
4370020	4371020	Or do you...
4371020	4372020	Oh, no.
4372020	4373020	You're...
4373020	4374020	Why did you guys do...
4374020	4375020	He would, like...
4375020	4376020	He nodded at Kumail.
4376020	4377020	Attack of the Show.
4377020	4378020	Oh, Attack of the Show.
4378020	4380020	Yeah, Alan, Alan shot a bunch of Attack of the Show.
4380020	4383020	Hey, I'm going to go to the bathroom, you guys.
4383020	4384020	Oh.
4384020	4385020	Okay.
4385020	4388020	All right.
4388020	4390020	That's nice to get over.
4390020	4394020	That's probably the first applause he's gotten for that since 1987.
4394020	4395020	Yeah.
4399020	4401020	Yeah, you know, I mean...
4401020	4403020	Yeah, when do you get applause for that?
4403020	4404020	Do you remember...
4404020	4405020	Does anyone remember being potty trained?
4405020	4406020	Is that a memory...
4406020	4410020	No, I remember my cousin, who was my age,
4410020	4413020	ate his own shit and it was a huge family scandal.
4413020	4414020	A scandal?
4414020	4415020	Yeah.
4415020	4416020	It was, like, spoken in hushed tones.
4416020	4419020	Like, his mom came in and she's lying.
4419020	4420020	At what age are we talking?
4420020	4421020	I don't know.
4421020	4423020	Like, infancy or toddler?
4423020	4425020	Enough to be walking around and stuff.
4425020	4427020	And he just picked up some poop and just decided...
4427020	4428020	Well, he...
4428020	4429020	He tried his own for size.
4429020	4432020	She put him on the toilet and then when she came back,
4432020	4434020	he had done his business and he was, like...
4434020	4435020	Oh.
4435020	4438020	He was bent over and just, like, pulling out and eating it, like...
4438020	4440020	Like, oh, I poop too much.
4440020	4441020	I should put...
4441020	4443020	He did not say I poop too much.
4443020	4444020	No, he didn't say anything.
4444020	4447020	He just gave it and he was like, hey, look.
4447020	4449020	But that would be a great time for a catchphrase
4449020	4451020	because, like, no one's ever going to forget
4451020	4452020	whatever you say there.
4452020	4455020	You could just be like, no new taxes.
4455020	4458020	They shouldn't be new taxes.
4458020	4461020	Like, you could get a guy elected if you ate your own shit
4461020	4464020	and then looked at the camera and were like, remember this?
4464020	4467020	Do you think as a kid being guilty about poopies
4467020	4469020	or he's starving?
4469020	4471020	Like, feed me more food.
4471020	4472020	What was his thing?
4472020	4473020	Yeah.
4473020	4475020	I think he was just an adventurous kid that was like,
4475020	4476020	let's see what this is about.
4476020	4477020	Well, you know, I mean...
4477020	4478020	Oh, no.
4478020	4480020	Freud's big thing was like...
4480020	4483020	I mean, I think Freud's been sort of, like,
4483020	4486020	discredited by his...
4486020	4488020	The people that came after him, which...
4488020	4490020	And I think a little too much because it's not like we all
4490020	4492020	question Ben Franklin when we talk about electricity.
4492020	4494020	Like, Freud was the first guy to go,
4494020	4496020	what if your brain is complicated?
4496020	4498020	And before that, it was just like, you're a lady.
4498020	4499020	You should lay down.
4499020	4500020	You're hysterical.
4500020	4502020	Your uterus is making you crazy.
4502020	4504020	And Freud was like, no, what if there's, like,
4504020	4507020	a bunch of shit in your brain that you don't even understand
4507020	4510020	and why we should take shits on him because he also said
4510020	4512020	we all want to fuck our moms.
4512020	4513020	I don't know.
4513020	4516020	But anyways, that was my Freud defense segment.
4516020	4518020	But Freud's thing was that, like, you know,
4518020	4522020	what is the first thing you ever do as a sentient mammal?
4522020	4524020	You know, other mammals, they just...
4524020	4526020	You know, deer are born and they start walking.
4526020	4530020	And kids are like, you know, we're born conscious.
4530020	4532020	And we may not be born moral, but we're born conscious
4532020	4533020	and sentient.
4533020	4538020	And then, like, the first thing that happens is you make something.
4538020	4541020	You make something that's not you, but you made it.
4541020	4542020	It came out of you.
4542020	4545020	And so things can happen.
4545020	4547020	You know, Freud's theory was that things are happening
4547020	4550020	formatively to you depending on the attitudes in their world
4550020	4552020	toward the thing you made.
4552020	4555020	And then the other things, the things you put in your mouth,
4555020	4557020	you know, that's all you can do.
4557020	4558020	You grab things and you stick them in your mouth.
4558020	4559020	How do people react to that?
4559020	4561020	How do you feel about that?
4561020	4563020	And, you know, you make a duty and you...
4563020	4564020	You know, it's all that...
4564020	4565020	You know, I've heard those phrases,
4565020	4567020	the anal fixation and the oral fixation and stuff.
4567020	4571020	But anyways, I believe that's totally valid.
4571020	4572020	That's stuff that makes sense.
4572020	4575020	Like, the penis plunger, I don't doubt it.
4575020	4577020	But it's so specific.
4577020	4579020	We have our episode title.
4579020	4580020	I know that.
4580020	4582020	Simple things make sense to me.
4582020	4584020	Like, oh, yeah, like, your mom's the first person...
4584020	4587020	Your first woman you meet and your dad's the first man you meet.
4587020	4589020	Like, you can't really argue with the simplicity of that.
4589020	4592020	You can then argue about neuroplasticity
4592020	4594020	and whether or not you still have a chance to, like, overcome
4594020	4597020	your nurture and your nature.
4597020	4602020	But it's still, like, simple shit makes sense to me.
4602020	4604020	You take a shit when your kid sees you
4604020	4606020	and you have shit on your hand in the crib.
4606020	4607020	And then you're like, probably...
4607020	4609020	I'm sure we all ate our own shit at some point.
4609020	4613020	We just didn't get caught and didn't do it like a weird cartoon,
4613020	4615020	like a Heathcliff cartoon.
4615020	4617020	He's got a turd and he's like...
4617020	4621020	He goes like this and then there's a fish bone comes out.
4621020	4625020	This guy took it to a Popeye place.
4625020	4629020	He deserves the shame that he probably still lives with.
4629020	4632020	Is it a cousin you said or was he?
4632020	4635020	Yeah, what's his first and last name?
4635020	4637020	I mean, what town does he live in?
4637020	4638020	How is he adjusted?
4638020	4640020	Has he grown up into a happy, healthy human being?
4640020	4644020	Oh, yeah, he's a doctor.
4644020	4645020	Well, who are some of his patients?
4645020	4647020	Maybe they're listeners, I mean...
4647020	4650020	He's a radiologist who are like...
4650020	4651020	I think they're like...
4651020	4652020	Yeah.
4652020	4653020	Look at X-rays.
4653020	4654020	Right.
4654020	4657020	And they're in charge of whether or not you get over or under-radiated
4657020	4658020	when you're...
4658020	4661020	So someone out there is, like, doesn't know that the guy at the button
4661020	4664020	once ate his own shit out of the toilet.
4664020	4665020	Yeah.
4665020	4666020	Like...
4666020	4668020	Do you remember when you...
4668020	4670020	I don't have any memories of potty training.
4670020	4671020	Spencer, how's it...
4671020	4673020	Yeah, yeah.
4673020	4676020	Are you okay? Do you want to talk about your poopies?
4676020	4677020	No, I just had to pee.
4677020	4679020	That was a pee. He was gone for 45 seconds.
4679020	4680020	Oh, okay. You just had to pee. Okay.
4680020	4681020	Yeah.
4681020	4683020	He came back like a ghost. It was amazing.
4683020	4685020	Oh, yeah. I may or may not have a kidney stone,
4685020	4686020	so I've been drinking water.
4686020	4687020	Oh, he's serious?
4687020	4688020	That's right.
4688020	4689020	Yeah, yeah.
4689020	4691020	Yeah, I was going to ask him for notes, you know.
4691020	4696020	Don't ask him. He's had them, like, four times.
4696020	4697020	Yeah.
4697020	4699020	That would be fun.
4699020	4701020	We got to get Spencer health coverage.
4702020	4703020	He texted me over the...
4703020	4704020	It's fine.
4704020	4706020	A couple days ago, it was like four in the morning,
4706020	4707020	and you were like, holy shit.
4707020	4708020	It's five.
4708020	4709020	He had this terrible pain in his gut,
4709020	4711020	and he was afraid to go to the emergency room because...
4711020	4713020	Yeah, because you hear horror stories that's like,
4713020	4718020	I broke my foot, and they charged me $20,000, you know?
4718020	4719020	I don't know.
4719020	4720020	You got to go in.
4720020	4723020	No, I went to the doctor. They said I had a kidney stone,
4723020	4725020	but, you know, who knows what they know?
4727020	4729020	How did they figure out that you had a kidney stone?
4729020	4731020	Because if they touched my appendix,
4731020	4735020	and it didn't feel like it exploded in my body,
4735020	4737020	I didn't have an appendix problem.
4737020	4741020	And, you know, urine tests denied infection.
4741020	4744020	So those are the things that can happen in your bladder.
4744020	4746020	That's a great song.
4749020	4750020	So, yeah.
4750020	4754020	Pea can form, but so can stalactites of calcium
4754020	4756020	that turn into shards.
4756020	4759020	And that's one thing that women have better than us.
4759020	4761020	It's the one thing.
4763020	4767020	70% of the wage is for the same job.
4768020	4771020	No maternity leave,
4771020	4776020	but you don't have shards of calcium,
4776020	4780020	ninja star-shaped bone fragments,
4780020	4783020	a Cronenbergian weapon,
4783020	4788020	trying to fit through a diameter of a drinking straw,
4788020	4792020	a cocktail straw, like a little tiny cocktail straw,
4792020	4799020	a fucking tiny ninja star the size of a marble.
4799020	4802020	Can I please right now send this out there into the ether
4802020	4804020	that the guy that did the Ty Brixton theme song
4804020	4806020	put music to that right there?
4806020	4808020	Well, I don't know if there was any meter to that.
4808020	4809020	I was really impressed with that.
4809020	4810020	Oh, there was plenty of meter.
4810020	4813020	The guy who did the thing for the Chinese,
4813020	4815020	when I was the guy like, those Chinese?
4815020	4817020	Ah, those Chinese.
4817020	4820020	When we were talking about misogyny and phylogeny,
4820020	4822020	and phylogeny is when you,
4822020	4825020	I just realized that misogyny,
4825020	4827020	wait, what was my epiphany?
4827020	4829020	Oh, it was that Phil file.
4829020	4831020	The Phil in philanthropy.
4831020	4833020	That it's like, oh, it's the same as the Phil.
4833020	4834020	It's the file.
4834020	4835020	Philadelphia.
4835020	4837020	It's the file like at the end of people
4837020	4838020	who fuck different things.
4838020	4839020	File.
4839020	4840020	Phil.
4840020	4841020	Philadelphia file.
4841020	4843020	Philanthropy versus misanthropy.
4843020	4845020	And then misogyny.
4845020	4847020	There is no philogony.
4847020	4849020	It's not even possible as far as I know.
4849020	4852020	The best you can do is get along with him at work.
4852020	4857020	But I was like, oh, so philogony would be that you like the Chinese.
4857020	4858020	And then I rushed into it.
4858020	4859020	Yeah, Chinese.
4859020	4860020	I was like, those Chinese?
4860020	4862020	Gotta get those Chinese.
4862020	4865020	And then like, why am I explaining this?
4866020	4867020	I must have missed that show.
4867020	4868020	That's not ringing any bells for me.
4868020	4869020	Did you?
4869020	4870020	I think you were here.
4870020	4871020	Oh, no.
4871020	4872020	Ridley, I think was comfortable.
4872020	4873020	I wasn't there for that one.
4873020	4874020	No, no, no.
4874020	4875020	You were sitting there because you were the one who was,
4875020	4878020	I was talking to philanthropy about Jesus Christ.
4878020	4879020	We're drunk.
4879020	4880020	Okay.
4880020	4881020	And I mean drunk like long term.
4881020	4883020	That sounds like a short bit,
4883020	4885020	but I didn't realize somebody made music to it.
4885020	4886020	Yeah.
4886020	4887020	Yeah.
4887020	4888020	I tweeted it.
4888020	4889020	I think I see.
4889020	4893020	Or I didn't retweet it because it sounds like I like those Chinese.
4893020	4894020	It does.
4894020	4895020	It's distracting for that reason.
4895020	4896020	Also, it's an Eric Idle song.
4896020	4898020	To the extent that you listen to it, because I go, because I go like,
4898020	4899020	how do you do it?
4899020	4900020	You got a hole where your wiener should be.
4900020	4903020	And it's like the, if I retweeted it,
4903020	4908020	the wrong kind of people would have like come out of the woodwork hearing it
4908020	4909020	out of context.
4909020	4911020	They would just be like, so hello.
4911020	4914020	Haven't seen you since the rape joke.
4914020	4916020	Like I don't listen to your show.
4916020	4917020	Don't know who you are.
4917020	4920020	Get you confused with everyone else.
4920020	4923020	There's a hole where your wiener should be.
4923020	4924020	Yeah.
4924020	4925020	That's great.
4925020	4926020	But it came out great.
4926020	4927020	You should listen to it.
4927020	4928020	It's a great song.
4928020	4929020	There's a hole where your wiener should be.
4929020	4930020	The guy put music to it.
4930020	4931020	I love it.
4931020	4932020	I can't wait.
4932020	4935020	There's a hole where your wiener should be.
4935020	4937020	Wiener as a hole?
4937020	4938020	That's a go-to for me.
4938020	4940020	I've used that phrase a lot.
4940020	4941020	Oh, okay.
4941020	4943020	That's my ironic misogynistic thing.
4943020	4947020	You don't see a wiener as another kind of hole?
4947020	4949020	The joke is that I don't.
4950020	4953020	The joke is where your wiener should be.
4953020	4955020	That's the joke.
4955020	4956020	You're right.
4956020	4957020	I'm in a bad mood.
4957020	4958020	I don't like you guys.
4958020	4959020	You're doing great, Dan.
4959020	4960020	Oh, okay.
4960020	4961020	Thank you.
4961020	4962020	Sorry.
4962020	4963020	I said I didn't like you.
4963020	4965020	You are doing great, but you're a little on edge tonight.
4965020	4966020	I'm on edge.
4966020	4967020	You feel a little edgy.
4967020	4968020	What a lovely day!
4968020	4970020	What a lovely day!
4970020	4973020	I was saying that during a lovely day.
4973020	4977020	Do you think that it could be as simple as just having played an edgy video game all
4977020	4979020	afternoon that that could make your mood a little easier?
4979020	4980020	Yeah.
4980020	4982020	My therapist says when I'm playing video games, I'm not actually...
4982020	4988020	No, it took her a while to her credit to start, you know, getting after the video game thing.
4988020	4992020	But she says from the description of what you're doing when you're playing video games
4992020	4996020	or what you do when you're at work, it sounds like you're not taking a break from work so
4996020	5001020	much as you are feeding an addiction to a heightened state of nervousness.
5001020	5002020	Wow.
5002020	5006020	Like your nervous system, you need to meditate and calm down.
5006020	5009020	And I have found that that works.
5009020	5010020	But I don't want to.
5010020	5013020	The way I don't want to take a shower, you know.
5013020	5017020	You don't want to do things that are good for you when you're like in an addicted state.
5017020	5021020	So I'm coming home from work and I'm like, I don't want to think about anything, but
5021020	5022020	I definitely...
5022020	5025020	My nervous system's at a six instead of a zero.
5025020	5027020	So it goes to nine.
5027020	5030020	The ten is...
5030020	5031020	You're dead.
5031020	5033020	You get a cooking show.
5034020	5037020	If I just keep talking, they'll think it's an awesome reference.
5037020	5039020	No one will ever know.
5039020	5041020	There's so many cooking shows by the time they get to the bottom of the list and they're
5041020	5044020	like, there's no such thing as a famous nervous cook.
5044020	5046020	I'm like, see you later, sucker.
5046020	5047020	I got your laugh.
5047020	5049020	I'm out of town.
5053020	5054020	But I didn't.
5054020	5057020	I stopped down and explained that and now I forgot what I was saying.
5057020	5058020	Oh, yeah, because I described her.
5058020	5059020	She's like, what do you do at work?
5059020	5062020	And I go, well, you know, she's like, I'm not writing one thing right now.
5062020	5064020	I'm helping a guy with the script.
5064020	5067020	It took me 20 minutes to describe what I'm doing right now because it's a lot of work,
5067020	5069020	a lot of jobs, a lot of different jobs.
5069020	5070020	I like that.
5070020	5071020	It's a lot of jobs.
5071020	5073020	I don't like focusing on one thing and blah, blah, blah.
5073020	5075020	And she's like, so when you relax, what do you do?
5075020	5076020	I play video games.
5076020	5078020	And she's like, what kind of video games?
5078020	5080020	And I said, well, I'm playing Witcher 3 right now.
5080020	5082020	And she says, well, what is that like?
5082020	5085020	And I said, well, it's like an open world game.
5085020	5086020	How much detail did you go into?
5086020	5088020	I explained it around 20 minutes ago.
5088020	5089020	Well, you're like a Witcher.
5089020	5091020	You're going to go at least side quests.
5091020	5092020	And then you could do the thing.
5092020	5097020	And she's like, if we were living in a time with the witches,
5097020	5105020	I wouldn't know which of those you just described that was the break you were taking.
5105020	5110020	Sounds like you may be actually just feeding a, you know, you're amped up
5110020	5113020	and then you're like, you want to stay there.
5113020	5114020	There was something you said real quick.
5114020	5116020	Do you meditate?
5116020	5117020	I do now.
5117020	5118020	And what is that like?
5118020	5122020	Breathing, but on purpose.
5122020	5127020	It's the first time that's ever been asked to anyone.
5127020	5130020	I can retire as a guru now.
5130020	5132020	Yeah, you're just breathing.
5132020	5135020	You're focusing your mind on the same thing your body is always focused on.
5135020	5136020	So they get on the same page.
5136020	5141020	And if you just keep breathing and try to stop thinking about things,
5141020	5143020	but you also don't punish yourself for thinking about things,
5143020	5144020	your mind is all warmed up.
5145020	5149020	Get your nervous system down to a zero level so that everything that's happening
5149020	5152020	is happening for the first time, like as far as your body's concerned.
5152020	5156020	That way, if something frustrating happens to you that's like a level of three frustration
5156020	5161020	and you're at a zero, it pumps you up to a three for a second.
5161020	5163020	It's much easier to get down to a zero from a three.
5163020	5167020	If you're at a six and a three happens, you turn into a, you get a cooking show.
5167020	5170020	Where did you learn the meditation?
5170020	5172020	Where did I what?
5172020	5174020	Where did you learn the meditation? Is there a teacher?
5174020	5176020	It's just breathing. It's not rocket science.
5176020	5179020	Well, I used to do it when I was very combative.
5181020	5184020	What level are you at now? Is this a zero?
5184020	5186020	Nah, I'm going to a six. Definitely. I'm going to a six.
5186020	5188020	What a lovely day!
5192020	5196020	I mean, I'm only personally joking when I went and saw the theory road.
5196020	5199020	I might have mentioned this when we talked about it on the show before.
5199020	5203020	When I drove home, I was disappointed that people weren't trying to ram me off the road.
5203020	5208020	I'm like, we're supposed to be at war when I'm behind the wheel.
5208020	5213020	It was two hours of wheels and exhaust and flame and all this stuff.
5213020	5217020	I was like, this drive home is so peaceful. I was like, it didn't make any sense to me.
5217020	5219020	I missed the tab of that. That's from you playing what?
5219020	5221020	That's for me watching the movie.
5221020	5222020	Oh, watching the movie.
5222020	5225020	Just being in the theater and you go home like, oh, I'm driving home right now.
5225020	5229020	Everybody's playing by the rules and being polite and stopping when the light is red.
5229020	5232020	It was strange.
5232020	5236020	Just shake yourself out a little bit of that thing that you've just been immersed into.
5236020	5241020	I can't imagine. When you play a video game, you play it for four or six hours sometimes.
5241020	5244020	I can't see how that would not affect you like that.
5244020	5247020	I don't know what I'm getting out of it sometimes.
5247020	5250020	I'm definitely being entertained and it's positive in some way,
5250020	5253020	but I don't know if I'm getting the kind of break that I need.
5253020	5258020	It's not a break. I think what we need to recognize is that you're going into a different room.
5258020	5263020	You're shutting out your real life, but that's different from taking a break.
5263020	5268020	You're not refilling your energy.
5268020	5273020	You're just putting an ice pack. I don't know what the metaphor would be.
5273020	5276020	You're just disconnecting.
5276020	5281020	It's true. If I'm working a lot, then I can't really play an intense video game,
5281020	5286020	which means it comes from the same reservoir of energy or whatever it is.
5286020	5294020	When I'm working a lot, I just play very repetitive video games that require no skill or concentration.
5294020	5298020	When I'm not working, then I'll play Witcher or Metal Gear or something.
5298020	5300020	You know what you never do?
5300020	5305020	You don't go and sit in the chair and put your hands on your laps and stare forward
5305020	5310020	and just take four second deep breaths and let them out.
5310020	5318020	It doesn't feel like that would make you worse at your job or worse at life.
5318020	5321020	It would definitely make you better.
5321020	5324020	It's not like you become the sugar bear where you're like,
5324020	5326020	Ooh, what's going on?
5326020	5332020	I do that. I'll sit quietly and just check Twitter or something.
5332020	5333020	I totally do that.
5333020	5337020	That's relaxing, checking Twitter.
5337020	5342020	That's definitely always relaxes me. I'm definitely going there for relaxation.
5342020	5344020	Let's bring out Demorge.
5344020	5348020	Demorge Brown.
5348020	5351020	Demorge Brown.
5351020	5354020	Hey, whatever happened to the fucking little cuties?
5354020	5356020	They're here.
5358020	5360020	Have we forgotten somebody?
5360020	5362020	We forgot the guests that we had tonight.
5362020	5366020	In my defense, they were not here when I took the stage, so I kind of forgot about them.
5366020	5367020	They're right here.
5367020	5369020	They've been there.
5369020	5373020	Demorge, there's two of them.
5373020	5376020	I would gladly go back to have them come out.
5376020	5378020	No, I'm telling you right now.
5378020	5380020	I know that David Horowitz as well, but I'm not sure.
5380020	5381020	Very good friends of mine.
5381020	5384020	We've got to talk to the little cuties because there's people here.
5384020	5385020	Oh, boy. Let's do that.
5385020	5386020	Demorge will be right back.
5386020	5387020	No.
5387020	5388020	Don't worry about it.
5388020	5389020	Are they not?
5389020	5391020	Are they down the street?
5391020	5393020	No, they're right back there.
5393020	5394020	I can see them.
5394020	5397020	Please welcome Dave Horowitz and Sean Perlman.
5403020	5405020	Yeah, Demorge.
5405020	5406020	We kicked him off.
5406020	5407020	I'm so sorry.
5407020	5409020	I'm so sorry, guys.
5409020	5411020	We got here like 804.
5411020	5413020	I hope you didn't think we weren't here.
5413020	5414020	We were here.
5414020	5415020	We heard the whole show.
5415020	5417020	A lot of Jizz talk.
5417020	5420020	Okay, what were they talking about at 804?
5420020	5422020	I'll read the minutes right now.
5422020	5423020	Nightmare on Elm Street.
5423020	5425020	Nightmare on Elm Street, too.
5425020	5426020	They were here.
5426020	5428020	Then we're hoping you bring up Dream Warriors, which you did.
5428020	5429020	That's my favorite one.
5429020	5433020	I'm very sorry, but I don't feel as bad because you weren't here.
5433020	5436020	It evens out.
5436020	5438020	I'm not mad that you weren't here.
5438020	5441020	It just allows me to not feel as bad as I should for forgetting to bring you up.
5441020	5442020	This is good.
5442020	5443020	It's positive.
5443020	5444020	Yeah.
5444020	5445020	We're at it.
5445020	5446020	We're at it.
5446020	5447020	Not as mad as a positive.
5447020	5448020	No, it's totally good.
5448020	5449020	He's neutral, right?
5449020	5450020	Yeah, yeah, neutral.
5450020	5453020	I'm at zero in terms of my relationship to them.
5453020	5455020	My nervous system's at a six.
5455020	5456020	I'm a fucking on edge.
5456020	5458020	It didn't help or hurt your nervousness.
5458020	5461020	I wanted to read some of Sean Perlman's tweets.
5461020	5463020	No, just go to Sean Perlman's Twitter.
5463020	5464020	It's funny.
5464020	5467020	He's one of those funny tweeters.
5467020	5469020	Sean, what's the handle so that we can find it?
5469020	5475020	It's s-h-a-w-n Perlman as Pearl as an oyster, Pearl and man.
5475020	5477020	My name.
5477020	5479020	That was so much more confusing than that.
5479020	5484020	Sean, it sounds like you're on a terrible date.
5484020	5486020	As in man, my name.
5486020	5489020	Gender and also what I...
5489020	5492020	Dan, what makes Sean's tweets so special to you?
5492020	5496020	I don't want to butcher his jokes, but he said one of them was like,
5496020	5498020	I'm really into religious texts recently,
5498020	5504020	like this one I got at 2 a.m. from my priest that said, you up.
5504020	5507020	Now I know how that's going to go out on stage.
5507020	5508020	That'll work.
5508020	5510020	Anyway, religious texts.
5510020	5512020	We've had that phrase forever.
5512020	5516020	I don't remember connecting those just...
5516020	5520020	And also a little anti-Catholic subversion in there, too.
5520020	5522020	I didn't even pick up on that until you said it.
5522020	5525020	Finally, we're giving it to those guys.
5525020	5526020	Oh, I don't want to just controversy.
5526020	5528020	I'm going to delete it now probably.
5528020	5534020	It's a Catholic show, but we're more Jesuit, so we're open to...
5534020	5537020	So you guys have a podcast called The Little Cuties?
5537020	5539020	Yeah, here on Feral Audio.
5539020	5541020	Let's hear it for Dustin Marshall.
5541020	5543020	Dustin Marshall!
5543020	5548020	Dustin! Dustin! Dustin! Dustin!
5548020	5550020	What do the little cuties do?
5550020	5551020	The little cuties...
5551020	5554020	What do the little cuties not do is my question.
5554020	5556020	Answer mine first.
5558020	5559020	Okay.
5559020	5564020	Well, they do not behave like adults a lot of the time?
5564020	5565020	Not yet.
5565020	5567020	So maybe if they wear button-down shirts,
5567020	5572020	they also come to this show on a giant cocktail of cold medicine,
5572020	5573020	which I am on.
5573020	5574020	Yeah, you sound like you've got a cold.
5574020	5575020	I'm a little sick right now.
5575020	5578020	Which is fine, but also, you know, like...
5578020	5580020	Maybe you are eating habits aren't super adults.
5580020	5584020	One time I ate Sean's three-week-old birthday cake for dinner.
5584020	5586020	That's just like the kind of stuff.
5586020	5588020	That's so many mistakes in one.
5588020	5589020	Yeah.
5589020	5590020	Just two.
5590020	5592020	Cake for dinner.
5592020	5593020	Three weeks old.
5593020	5594020	My birthday cake.
5594020	5597020	I was saving for three weeks to fucking eat.
5597020	5598020	And you told me, please don't eat.
5598020	5601020	There was a sign that said, Dave, don't eat this cake.
5601020	5602020	This is you.
5602020	5603020	I'm talking to you, Dave Horwitz.
5603020	5606020	He was bound and gagged as he was eating my birthday cake,
5606020	5608020	just, you know, laughing at my face.
5608020	5611020	Part of that story is made up.
5611020	5613020	The thing I would be most excited to talk to you guys about,
5613020	5616020	but we can't because we had dinner,
5616020	5618020	because I have a studio and we talked about that idea,
5618020	5622020	but I want to make it into a cartoon so we can't talk about it.
5622020	5623020	Why didn't I bring it up?
5623020	5624020	I don't know.
5624020	5627020	All is forgiven.
5627020	5629020	What do you guys talk about on the podcast?
5629020	5630020	We talk about regret.
5630020	5632020	We have a lot of regrets as two men.
5632020	5635020	We talk about being, we're both 32 years of age.
5635020	5640020	We're both trying, you know, to maybe act a little bit more adult.
5640020	5644020	We've reached a point in our life where we can't get away with quite as much anymore.
5644020	5647020	You know, we still feel like little babies,
5647020	5648020	but we're not.
5648020	5649020	People expect more of us.
5649020	5651020	So we're just trying to be better human beings.
5652020	5655020	And so we invite people on who may or may not be grown up,
5655020	5657020	and then we sort of ask them, are you an adult?
5657020	5658020	Are you a little cutie?
5658020	5660020	Which we could posit to the group.
5660020	5661020	Yeah.
5661020	5667020	It took us a few episodes to actually solidify the definition of little cuties.
5667020	5669020	So, right?
5669020	5670020	Yeah, a little bit.
5670020	5671020	But then we got there.
5671020	5675020	I was trying to make it a big all-encompassing life philosophy,
5675020	5679020	which I realized three episodes that I wasn't smart enough to do.
5679020	5681020	Well, I wasn't even included in that.
5681020	5684020	So I felt like, you know, so yeah, you know.
5684020	5686020	Somewhere on the fourth episode, we went to a stand-up show.
5686020	5687020	We got into a big fight.
5687020	5689020	It was like a stand-up versus a stand-up fight.
5689020	5690020	With each other?
5690020	5691020	Yeah, yeah.
5691020	5694020	We went to a big fight and just had like this big long drawn-out thing
5694020	5697020	in the back of like, what was like a brewery where there was a stand-up show.
5697020	5700020	And we realized like, this isn't worth it.
5700020	5701020	It's not worth it to fight.
5701020	5702020	It's not worth it to admit.
5702020	5703020	Is there a real fight?
5703020	5704020	Like, I mean, not fist fight.
5704020	5705020	Not fist fight.
5705020	5707020	A real emotional, like, dust up.
5707020	5709020	It was the worst fight we've ever had.
5709020	5710020	But it was also the only fight we've ever had.
5710020	5711020	But a lot of good.
5711020	5712020	How long have you guys known each other?
5712020	5713020	Seven or eight years.
5713020	5714020	Yeah.
5714020	5717020	And we've been coming on married for six, right?
5717020	5719020	No, he's nervous.
5719020	5722020	The word little cutie, is that something that you, is that a joke
5722020	5724020	that you've been called in the past?
5724020	5725020	Oh, you little cutie.
5725020	5729020	Yeah, a friend of mine used to kind of make fun of me a little bit.
5729020	5732020	Good naturely, but I used to, any time I would show up to a party
5732020	5734020	in like a sweater or a button-down shirt
5734020	5738020	or just anything that kind of was me trying to look a little bit older
5738020	5740020	or act a little bit older, she would just look at me and go,
5740020	5741020	look at you.
5741020	5743020	Look at you, little cutie in your little sweater.
5743020	5744020	Look at you.
5744020	5745020	What is that?
5745020	5746020	Is that a button-down shirt with a sweater over it?
5746020	5747020	Oh, my God.
5747020	5748020	And I was like, well, what does that mean?
5748020	5749020	What?
5749020	5750020	I'm not allowed to be an adult.
5750020	5751020	And she's like, you're just such a little cutie.
5751020	5752020	And I realized, like, oh, I can't.
5752020	5755020	I'm like wearing the disguise of an adult.
5755020	5758020	Yeah, but I would say that you would also, like,
5758020	5759020	because I've known you for a little while,
5759020	5765020	that you might be a successful 65, 75, 85-year-old gentleman
5765020	5767020	that, you know, with like loads of giant...
5767020	5768020	No, he's 32.
5768020	5769020	Oh, shit.
5769020	5770020	Oh, my God.
5770020	5771020	Sorry.
5771020	5772020	He probably gets that a lot.
5772020	5778020	I'm saying, as your life goes on, you might be a successful man
5778020	5780020	and people still go, that's a little cutie.
5780020	5783020	Like, that might just be something essentially who you both might be.
5783020	5785020	Like, you might be eternal little cuties,
5785020	5789020	which is one of the greatest things that you might be.
5789020	5792020	Somebody odd, which is the kind of thing we're going for.
5792020	5793020	Which is good.
5793020	5795020	It's an inside job.
5795020	5797020	Yeah, we can sneak a couple of those through.
5797020	5800020	We sort of wanted the aesthetic of, like, the Muppet Babies
5800020	5802020	where we're, like, on these little bodies
5802020	5805020	and we're looking up at legs, you know,
5805020	5808020	opening the door and catching us the mischief.
5808020	5810020	Yeah, but like, but our mischief is, like,
5810020	5812020	not knowing how to text a girl back or, like, you know,
5812020	5814020	freaking out over a job.
5814020	5817020	I understand I should have consumed the material
5817020	5820020	before we talked about your material on the show,
5820020	5822020	but I don't understand the format.
5822020	5823020	Is it a podcast?
5823020	5826020	Are you guys in front of a microphone talking about the stuff?
5826020	5828020	Oh, we should get microphones.
5828020	5831020	Is it a fictional narrative?
5831020	5835020	It's a live podcast, and it's gone once they stop talking.
5835020	5836020	Yeah, you could...
5836020	5839020	When the clock runs out, then we're done.
5839020	5841020	We do it at Griffith Park at midnight.
5841020	5843020	No, we usually...
5843020	5844020	Look at those cuties.
5844020	5846020	Yeah, see? See?
5846020	5847020	No, yeah, we...
5847020	5849020	Maybe if you don't understand the format,
5849020	5851020	it's because we're not super locked into one yet.
5851020	5852020	We've only had 12 episodes.
5852020	5853020	We've got a couple of guests.
5853020	5855020	We just kind of have a free-flowing interview
5855020	5857020	with the guests we bring on.
5857020	5860020	The first 20 or so minutes, we get to know our guests.
5860020	5863020	We get to see, like, what kind of behavior, you know,
5863020	5866020	makes up their life, if they consider themselves an adult,
5866020	5868020	you know, what kind of behavior they exhibit.
5868020	5870020	If, you know, we have some arbitrary, like,
5870020	5872020	do you live alone or do you have a long-term partner?
5872020	5875020	Do you have a stable employment?
5875020	5878020	So far, only one person has identified as an adult.
5878020	5879020	One person has said, oh, yeah, I'm a totally an adult.
5879020	5880020	Who was it?
5880020	5881020	I'm your bloomin' fault.
5881020	5882020	Okay.
5882020	5884020	I would not have thought of him as an adult.
5884020	5885020	But he's very confident.
5885020	5887020	We were like, you're anxious and we're like us, right?
5887020	5888020	And he's like, no, I got everything under control.
5888020	5890020	And we're like, okay, got it.
5890020	5892020	Camille, do you feel like an adult?
5892020	5895020	Or a little cutie?
5895020	5898020	I don't know if I'm committing myself to that term.
5898020	5900020	It might feel good if you say it.
5901020	5906020	I'm pretty sure it's not going to feel good.
5906020	5909020	I like a big fat mountain of tits.
5909020	5911020	That is the third option we have.
5911020	5912020	You forgot to mention that.
5912020	5914020	I was going to suggest you add that because, like,
5914020	5920020	I guess I'm a baby in the sense that I'm a big fucking slobby and gross.
5920020	5924020	The secret venue.
5924020	5927020	Spencer, do you feel like an adult?
5927020	5929020	Sure, yeah.
5929020	5930020	You do?
5930020	5931020	Confidently?
5931020	5934020	Well, here's the thing, you guys.
5934020	5939020	I think of myself as, like, a kid when I'm not paying attention.
5939020	5940020	You know?
5940020	5943020	Like, I see a couple kids and I'm like, oh, check out those kids.
5943020	5947020	I'm 27.
5947020	5948020	You know?
5948020	5950020	We're not both kids together.
5950020	5953020	You see kids and you identify with them and you go, yeah, these are my people.
5953020	5957020	Yeah, they're not going to arrest me for smoking pot.
5957020	5958020	They're not going to call the cops.
5958020	5960020	How old is a kid in your mind, though?
5960020	5962020	You said I'm looking at a kid.
5962020	5963020	How old is that kid?
5963020	5966020	Straight, 14.
5966020	5969020	I'm like, we're on the same level.
5969020	5972020	So then you're a little cutie.
5972020	5974020	Well, that's when I'm not paying attention.
5974020	5978020	But otherwise, I just feel like, yeah, it's not like I'm not going around in my life
5978020	5980020	like being childish.
5980020	5991020	I'm not super up on how mortgages work or what a credit limit is or stuff like that.
5991020	5992020	But I mean...
5992020	5994020	Do you know what your credit score is?
5994020	5996020	It happens to be 750.
5996020	5997020	You're an adult.
5997020	5998020	You're an adult.
5998020	5999020	You're an adult.
5999020	6000020	That's nice, dude.
6000020	6001020	Is that good?
6001020	6002020	That's good.
6002020	6003020	750 is very...
6003020	6005020	It's a good, solid score.
6005020	6007020	Mine was in the 500s.
6007020	6008020	Oh, man.
6008020	6009020	Yeah.
6009020	6011020	Mine's not 750.
6011020	6013020	That's from a commercial I saw.
6013020	6016020	You little cutie.
6016020	6018020	You're a little cutie.
6018020	6022020	It's like that joke, though.
6022020	6024020	You might be a redneck.
6024020	6025020	You might be a little cutie.
6025020	6030020	If you don't know your own credit score, it might be a little cutie.
6030020	6034020	If you got your credit score from a commercial, you might...
6034020	6035020	Yeah.
6035020	6038020	If you see a 14-year-old and you're like, that's like me,
6038020	6040020	you might be a little cutie.
6040020	6044020	Now, David and Sean, are you guys using this to strive to be adults
6044020	6046020	or do you want to remain little cuties?
6046020	6050020	Are you asking the universe whether or not it's a this or that kind of situation?
6050020	6054020	We hope that there is like an arc to our podcast
6054020	6056020	that over time we'll become...
6056020	6058020	We'll graduate as adults in the final episode.
6058020	6060020	I feel like we've already made strides.
6060020	6064020	When we started it, I was a sad, unemployed man
6064020	6067020	and just a beaten down old soul.
6067020	6071020	Now I'm employed, I'm in a healthy, wonderful relationship.
6071020	6072020	I bought...
6072020	6074020	It sounds like you bought these shoes.
6074020	6076020	It's bad radio, but they're nice shoes.
6076020	6078020	One person agrees.
6078020	6082020	It sounds like you're becoming an adult, but your shoes say little cutie.
6082020	6083020	See?
6083020	6085020	We're trying to confuse you.
6085020	6087020	I would say I think that you know that you...
6087020	6088020	Here's my prediction.
6088020	6090020	Sean stays little cutie all the way through.
6090020	6093020	You turn into the Walter Mathau and his odd couple
6094020	6096020	and your shoes are always...
6096020	6099020	You're always going to find a way to add on one little cutie aspect of yourself
6099020	6101020	to deny yourself of your adulthood.
6101020	6105020	I think I'll just start wearing much brighter colors the more white my hair starts going.
6105020	6108020	So when I'm full Steve Martin, I'll just be wearing like a clown outfit.
6108020	6110020	And then all bets are off.
6110020	6114020	I'll have to invent a new category in the mountain of tits secret menu realm.
6116020	6117020	All right.
6117020	6119020	Well, so we get...
6120020	6123020	I was going to say like the little cutie should come back next week or something
6123020	6127020	so we can have them be littler and more cute for a longer time with us
6127020	6129020	because I kind of... I fucked them over.
6129020	6133020	I forgot that they existed until it was time to start playing D&D.
6133020	6135020	We'll get out of here.
6135020	6136020	I'll say this though.
6136020	6138020	Of all the people that we brought on that do podcasts,
6138020	6140020	some whom I know and some whom I do not,
6140020	6141020	I want to listen to little cuties.
6141020	6142020	I like this premise.
6142020	6143020	Yeah.
6143020	6144020	I mean, that's the important thing.
6144020	6145020	It's a feral audio podcast.
6145020	6146020	Now you can start listening to it.
6146020	6148020	We'll have the little cuties on next week or something.
6148020	6149020	What are you, Jeff?
6149020	6150020	You've asked everyone.
6150020	6151020	What about you?
6151020	6153020	I would say probably an adult,
6153020	6155020	but that won't grow up in a certain way,
6155020	6157020	but I wouldn't call those ways little cutie ways.
6157020	6159020	I think that I'm kind of an eternal...
6160020	6161020	Okay. I'll just say adult.
6161020	6163020	When I was four, I felt 40.
6163020	6165020	I'm 41 now. I feel 40.
6165020	6169020	If I live to be 90, I will be a 40.
6169020	6170020	You're a little 40.
6170020	6172020	I'm a little 40.
6172020	6173020	You're a little 40.
6173020	6174020	Wow.
6174020	6176020	He's a little 40.
6177020	6179020	A four-year-old that knows how to tie his own tie,
6179020	6182020	I felt like an adult most of the time.
6182020	6183020	Wow. You were this the whole time.
6183020	6185020	That makes so much sense.
6186020	6187020	It really does.
6187020	6189020	Like little four-year-old Jeff Davis.
6189020	6190020	When we talked about this,
6190020	6193020	the picture of you when you were like a kid actor,
6193020	6194020	stunning.
6194020	6195020	Stunning.
6195020	6197020	I was a little cutie when I was a kid.
6197020	6198020	Yeah.
6198020	6200020	I was also an adult.
6202020	6205020	I was breaking home with a fucking bacon.
6205020	6206020	You are.
6206020	6207020	King and I.
6207020	6209020	Well, let's send the little cuties to their room
6209020	6211020	and Demarge back out.
6211020	6212020	All right. We're grounded. Thanks, guys.
6212020	6214020	We'll have you back, little cuties.
6214020	6216020	Sorry, guys. I'll make it up to you.
6217020	6219020	They're little cuties.
6223020	6225020	They're easy to abuse because they're little cuties.
6225020	6228020	Demarge Brown, get back at her, would you?
6232020	6234020	Sorry about that, Demarge.
6234020	6235020	I'm all apologies tonight.
6235020	6237020	That's the title of the podcast.
6237020	6240020	What else can I be?
6240020	6241020	Oh, no, no, no.
6241020	6243020	We're going to get Shazam scanned and blocked
6243020	6245020	by a universal record.
6245020	6247020	You sang the entire High Women song.
6247020	6249020	That was a damn bittler.
6249020	6251020	When I was in high school,
6251020	6254020	among the things that we loved to freak out about
6254020	6255020	was that High Women song.
6255020	6256020	Oh, yeah.
6256020	6257020	You guys have never seen the video.
6257020	6258020	Oh, no.
6258020	6259020	Is Johnny Cash in space?
6259020	6261020	There are two of them.
6261020	6263020	One of them is the official video,
6263020	6265020	which I think was the video they made
6265020	6267020	in the style of Iron Maiden's The Trooper.
6267020	6270020	It's a black and white Conestoga wagon freak out
6270020	6272020	where they took the clouds and isolated them somehow
6272020	6274020	and turned them upside down and then time-lapse them
6274020	6276020	so they're churning.
6276020	6278020	Yeah, I've seen that since a long time ago.
6278020	6279020	Yeah.
6279020	6282020	But when Cash shows up, his face appears in space.
6282020	6284020	Oh.
6284020	6286020	So he's just in the clouds telling you about the starship.
6286020	6288020	I'm appearing via satellite.
6288020	6290020	Willie, I can't make it to the shoot.
6290020	6291020	That's all right.
6292020	6293020	You can be in space.
6293020	6295020	You say you're in space, man.
6295020	6296020	Thanks, Willie.
6296020	6297020	You're welcome, Johnny.
6297020	6300020	It's sort of like a solid gold-produced type performance.
6300020	6302020	I think they were in one of those countries.
6302020	6303020	Some countries start with get a hit,
6303020	6305020	and they give them a summer special for episodes.
6305020	6308020	And there's one, I think it just looks like
6308020	6311020	they're standing there, and everything's green screen.
6311020	6315020	And then when it gets to Cash, all the windows turn to space.
6315020	6317020	And he's wearing a long coat,
6317020	6319020	and then they put chrome on it or something.
6320020	6322020	He's the only one who doesn't move.
6322020	6324020	So when he's saying, I fly a starship,
6324020	6326020	only his cheeks are kind of vibrating.
6326020	6329020	The starship has no windshield.
6329020	6331020	Yeah, something like that.
6331020	6333020	But it has stability control, so you can stand on it
6333020	6335020	and just kind of ride it like a skateboard.
6335020	6337020	Like a segue.
6337020	6339020	Yeah, absolutely.
6339020	6340020	All right.
6340020	6342020	So are you a little cutie or not a little cutie?
6342020	6343020	Hell no, man.
6343020	6345020	There's nothing little about me.
6345020	6347020	Oh, man.
6348020	6351020	Let's skew female in the choosing of a helper.
6351020	6355020	You can be someone who's presenting as female.
6355020	6357020	You can be having a female day.
6357020	6359020	You can have an inner chromosome,
6359020	6362020	but I'm not going to pick you if you look like a dude.
6362020	6364020	Because we've had too many.
6364020	6366020	Anybody that hasn't been up here before
6366020	6368020	that's feeling feminine.
6368020	6370020	Yeah, right in the middle.
6370020	6371020	What's your name?
6371020	6372020	Marissa.
6372020	6374020	Come join us, Marissa, would you?
6378020	6380020	I'm handing these.
6383020	6384020	And I believe you'll be playing
6384020	6389020	Aaron McGathey's character, Mercy O'Donnell.
6389020	6390020	Oh, awesome.
6390020	6392020	Because we have the original Dr. Friend here,
6392020	6393020	and we certainly have our hortiguard.
6393020	6396020	Camille, you've only played Dr. Friend how many times?
6396020	6397020	Just you?
6397020	6398020	He hasn't.
6398020	6399020	I have.
6399020	6400020	Nope.
6400020	6401020	Who was I?
6401020	6404020	You explained your character but never played.
6404020	6405020	Okay, sure.
6405020	6406020	That makes sense.
6406020	6407020	Oh, I played once.
6407020	6408020	I don't think so.
6408020	6409020	Okay.
6409020	6410020	You might have.
6410020	6411020	Thank you.
6411020	6412020	Oh, thanks, Hannah.
6412020	6414020	Thanks for coming up, Marissa.
6414020	6415020	Oh, thanks.
6415020	6416020	So, best behavior, guys.
6416020	6419020	Let's really knock this role-playing out of the park.
6419020	6420020	For eight minutes.
6420020	6421020	Alan Wu is here observing.
6421020	6423020	He's going to direct Harmon Quest.
6423020	6425020	So he's like, where would I put the camera,
6425020	6426020	and what is this show?
6426020	6427020	I already warned him.
6427020	6428020	It's a mess.
6428020	6430020	Don't come to the Harmon Town show
6430020	6432020	and think that it's what we do.
6432020	6434020	But I also think we could knock it out of the park.
6434020	6436020	Yeah, in our minds, we play this game for a half hour
6436020	6439020	every show, but we only play it for 45 seconds.
6439020	6441020	And nothing ever happens except then,
6441020	6444020	because we're all blackout drunk at the end of the show,
6444020	6446020	I was just in the green room with Spencer.
6446020	6448020	He was describing what happened last time.
6448020	6450020	I was like, I don't remember any of that
6450020	6452020	about the MP3s and stuff.
6452020	6455020	So we have to really listen to his recap.
6455020	6456020	Spencer, you ready for a recap?
6456020	6458020	Okay, I'm not going to ask too many questions or anything.
6458020	6460020	I'm just going to play along because we don't have much time.
6460020	6461020	Do you know what we're doing, Marissa,
6461020	6462020	or did you just come up with me?
6462020	6463020	No, I know what we're doing.
6463020	6464020	Okay, cool.
6464020	6465020	I know exactly what we're doing.
6465020	6466020	Great, great.
6466020	6467020	Well, thank you for helping.
6467020	6470020	I'm frightened.
6470020	6473020	All right, this one's done by Chris Miller,
6473020	6477020	and he did it in rhyme.
6477020	6480020	All right, I'll just do it.
6480020	6483020	Jim Nightblade now founded Obscene.
6483020	6485020	The failures beset by his team.
6485020	6488020	Their briefcase was empty, his conscience weighed hefty,
6488020	6491020	and Mercy couldn't even shit while remaining unseen.
6491020	6496020	The gang met at Old Hank's Salon to put on an old 70s band on.
6496020	6497020	That's my fault.
6497020	6500020	But the jukebox was vapid and Old Hank was rapid
6500020	6503020	to suggest an adventure that might not be canon.
6503020	6506020	So our runners trek to an academy
6506020	6509020	for the help of some much-gifted progeny,
6509020	6513020	with their persistent assistance at Hank's Great Insistence,
6513020	6516020	they'd have a song that would say Open Sesame.
6516020	6518020	Thank you.
6519020	6521020	Wow.
6521020	6524020	Dan, that help you out?
6524020	6525020	That'll catch you all up.
6525020	6527020	I would like to discourage that behavior in the future
6527020	6529020	if you're writing a recap.
6529020	6534020	I would like to go for content over style.
6534020	6536020	This recap is all in Portuguese.
6536020	6538020	Because nobody's listening to these recaps
6538020	6541020	more intently than me,
6541020	6543020	because I was drunk last week when I played,
6543020	6544020	and now I'm drunk this week,
6544020	6546020	and I'm like, what did that drunk guy do?
6546020	6549020	We have to come up with a song that cracks a code?
6549020	6550020	What?
6550020	6553020	We were all trying to write an awesome song, right?
6553020	6554020	No.
6554020	6556020	You're trying to find a song that cracks a code.
6556020	6559020	Fuck, that doesn't ring any bells.
6559020	6561020	Well, you know what's going on, Marisa.
6561020	6562020	I think that was snuck in at the end,
6562020	6564020	like the very last second.
6564020	6565020	Oh, yeah.
6565020	6568020	You're standing in the academy of a gifted art students
6568020	6572020	in front of several small, creepy-looking children.
6572020	6574020	You've just shown them what you got
6574020	6579020	for, you know, no reason and with no introduction.
6579020	6581020	We, like, sang for them?
6581020	6582020	Yeah.
6582020	6583020	Was I here for this one?
6583020	6586020	Dude, it was a blackout, straight blackout.
6586020	6588020	Because it was Paul Scheer and Rob Hubel were up here,
6588020	6589020	and it was like...
6589020	6590020	Oh, yeah, it was all over the shop.
6590020	6591020	Yeah, this is...
6591020	6595020	I'm looking at my notes, and all I wrote down was...
6595020	6596020	Troll Magnet.
6596020	6597020	That's all I have.
6597020	6598020	That was from three ago.
6598020	6599020	Troll Magnet!
6599020	6600020	And you kind of...
6600020	6601020	So Ghoul Magnet.
6601020	6602020	Ghoul Magnet.
6602020	6605020	That was 18 shows ago.
6605020	6608020	I remember Vagina Mesh happened at the very end.
6608020	6611020	There was a Vagina Mesh commercial or something?
6611020	6612020	Yeah.
6612020	6613020	Transva...
6613020	6614020	Well, that was two episodes ago.
6614020	6615020	Great.
6615020	6616020	Two or three.
6616020	6617020	Alan is in free-fault panic right now.
6617020	6618020	Yeah.
6618020	6622020	He's saying, I turned down a cooking show for this.
6622020	6624020	There was going to be one guy cooking,
6624020	6627020	one camera, easiest job of the world.
6627020	6628020	Is that real?
6628020	6629020	No.
6629020	6631020	No, that's a reference to the most nervous thing possible.
6631020	6634020	Yeah, I'm doing a cooking show theme.
6634020	6635020	Spencer, where are we standing?
6635020	6636020	What do we need?
6636020	6639020	We're in the Academy of Gifted Arts students.
6639020	6641020	All right, so let's do this song, right?
6641020	6644020	We got to find a song to crack the code?
6644020	6645020	You got to find...
6645020	6649020	You asked them for help to learn how to get perfect pitch
6649020	6652020	so you can break the musical locks.
6652020	6654020	Okay, let's ask them.
6654020	6656020	All right, go ahead.
6656020	6659020	Hey, so what do we need to do to break this lock?
6660020	6662020	Oh, I don't know what you're talking about,
6662020	6664020	but if you want to learn how to sing,
6664020	6666020	we'll really put you through the ringer.
6666020	6668020	All right, so I have a question for the Game Master.
6668020	6669020	Thank you.
6669020	6671020	This lock doesn't really exist, right?
6671020	6674020	We just came to this Academy because we assumed going on an MP3 mission,
6674020	6677020	which was made up by somebody that we were going to have to sing eventually,
6677020	6679020	so we came to the Academy to learn how to sing.
6679020	6682020	Yeah, the locks exist, but they're, you know,
6682020	6685020	they're locking the cargo, which you're not near.
6685020	6687020	Oh, okay, so we are here for a reason.
6687020	6689020	Are we on a mission right now? Do we have a Johnson?
6689020	6691020	We're going to get the MP3s back.
6691020	6693020	Okay, all right.
6693020	6695020	Okay, that rings sort of a bell.
6695020	6698020	Okay, so we are here to learn how to sing.
6698020	6699020	Okay, so what did you say?
6699020	6700020	Yeah, put us through your ringer.
6700020	6703020	I think you'll find out that you little whippersnappers
6703020	6706020	have nothing on a hardcore, seasoned,
6706020	6709020	salty group of Shadowrunners any day of the week.
6709020	6712020	All right, training montage, right?
6712020	6713020	Right.
6713020	6717020	And you're going to find the power.
6717020	6718020	All right.
6718020	6721020	You learn how to sing.
6721020	6722020	Okay.
6722020	6725020	Your pitch is perfect.
6725020	6726020	Okay.
6726020	6732020	Kids, thank you.
6732020	6733020	Okay, this way.
6733020	6734020	Thank you.
6734020	6736020	Thank you.
6736020	6739020	Thank you.
6739020	6749020	We've achieved three students level status on that one.
6749020	6752020	Yeah, we're not cutting an album anytime soon,
6752020	6759020	but we could make an intro as plumbers.
6759020	6763020	Yeah, we're the most fun plumbers you've ever hired.
6763020	6764020	All right, see you later.
6764020	6766020	We'll send you a check.
6766020	6767020	Oh, thanks.
6768020	6771020	Boy, that was a tough six days.
6771020	6774020	It felt like seven.
6774020	6779020	So what do we use this new power that we are clearly
6779020	6784020	one of the burgeoning hotshot vocal groups in town?
6784020	6787020	How do we use this to our advantage as Shadowrunners?
6787020	6790020	Well, we're going to go on this mission that we took on,
6790020	6792020	and then I explain what the mission is.
6792020	6793020	Via Spencer.
6793020	6795020	In Spencer's voice.
6795020	6797020	So Hank's last stand, you were there.
6797020	6800020	Hank, he was explaining that the jukebox was all fucked up
6800020	6803020	because he doesn't have any of that old style MP3s.
6803020	6805020	It's all new age garbage.
6805020	6809020	And so he knew that in a storage facility,
6809020	6813020	there was under lock and key, musical lock and key,
6813020	6817020	all the MP3 profiles that you could ever ask for.
6817020	6821020	And how far away are we from the storage facility?
6821020	6823020	Not far.
6823020	6826020	Shall we call close enough to call an Uber or close enough to walk?
6826020	6828020	You're close enough to walk.
6828020	6830020	No, let's walk. We can get to know each other.
6830020	6833020	I think we should get an Uber anyway. I mean, it's a hot day.
6833020	6836020	Yeah, but you don't want to go through that Uber shame thing.
6836020	6838020	I already called one shit.
6838020	6839020	Fuck.
6839020	6841020	You know when we could just walk?
6841020	6844020	Yeah, but if you cancel it, then I'm going to charge you five.
6844020	6847020	And also your rating will go down several stars.
6847020	6849020	That's right. I'm sorry.
6849020	6850020	They're going to lower your rating too.
6850020	6852020	The Uber arrives.
6852020	6853020	That's shit.
6853020	6855020	There's five of us.
6855020	6857020	Can you take five?
6857020	6858020	Can you take five?
6858020	6860020	There's no driver.
6860020	6861020	It's an automated Uber.
6861020	6864020	Yes, but automated driver, can you seat five in this thing?
6864020	6866020	There's five seats.
6866020	6867020	Oh, okay.
6867020	6872020	Take us to Hank's last stand and drive like Fury.
6872020	6874020	All right.
6874020	6877020	Hello. I am automated.
6877020	6879020	I'm on.
6879020	6884020	Hope you will enjoy a clip from Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
6884020	6886020	Brought to you by Doritos.
6886020	6893020	When your wife takes this Uber, she will be sexually harassed.
6893020	6896020	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6896020	6897020	Yeah, I already did that.
6897020	6898020	I know, but they didn't hear it. Only I did.
6898020	6899020	Okay.
6899020	6900020	So we're there.
6900020	6901020	You're at Hank's last stand.
6901020	6903020	Hey, Hank, listen, we learned how to sing.
6903020	6907020	Tony, you want these MP3s just to make your jukebox the best jukebox in the world?
6907020	6908020	Oh, yeah.
6908020	6911020	Is there a more, is there an ulterior motive in there?
6911020	6914020	When we have good music, let me tell you.
6914020	6915020	Okay.
6915020	6917020	The customers are going to start rolling in.
6917020	6921020	Okay, so we should sing to your jukebox now to open this thing up and get the MP3s?
6921020	6923020	No, you should not do that.
6923020	6925020	We should go to the storage facility.
6925020	6927020	Oh, right, right, right.
6927020	6928020	Why did we come here first?
6928020	6929020	Why did we come here first?
6929020	6930020	I thought we were going to go to the store.
6930020	6934020	Oh, I left my Apache Warhammer here.
6934020	6936020	How far are we from the storage facility?
6936020	6937020	Now you're 20 minutes.
6937020	6938020	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6938020	6939020	We were close to the bottom.
6939020	6941020	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6941020	6944020	Mike, they suggest that we go back to the storage facility.
6944020	6947020	That means that I'm bat wiping us to the next thing.
6947020	6949020	You're outside of store quest.
6949020	6950020	Okay.
6950020	6952020	It's a storage facility.
6952020	6954020	Incidentally, you can't do that.
6954020	6955020	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6955020	6957020	You're not the game master.
6957020	6960020	Oh, keep it up and up and under this and you guys wanted to talk.
6960020	6961020	No, he did it the first one.
6961020	6962020	He didn't do this.
6962020	6963020	I'm adding a monomonominem.
6963020	6965020	You can't just add monomonominem.
6965020	6967020	You can just repeat monomonominem.
6967020	6969020	I'll stop the Uber.
6969020	6971020	Let's go back in time for Hank's last hand and get back in the Uber.
6971020	6972020	I won't do that.
6972020	6973020	Okay, so we're at the Uber?
6973020	6974020	We're back in the Uber.
6974020	6975020	Yeah, you're back in the Uber.
6975020	6977020	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6979020	6983020	You find yourself outside store quest storage facility.
6983020	6984020	Thank you, Spencer.
6984020	6985020	I feel like it's as if I've been here before.
6985020	6988020	You have a storage facility here.
6988020	6989020	All right, guys.
6989020	6990020	Brief pep talk.
6990020	6991020	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6991020	6992020	Shit.
6992020	6993020	No.
6993020	6994020	Your couch.
6994020	6996020	That's why I think we'll do great.
7004020	7007020	Wow, that was the best pep talk you've ever given.
7007020	7008020	Thank you.
7008020	7009020	That was like 45 minutes long.
7009020	7011020	Yeah, but it went by like that.
7011020	7012020	But worth it, am I right?
7012020	7014020	Yeah, you were like Martin Luther King.
7014020	7015020	Oh my God.
7015020	7016020	Remember that.
7016020	7020020	It was touch and go when I used Holocaust metaphors.
7022020	7024020	Is that a helicopter based Holocaust?
7024020	7026020	That's like a little kid like being tired about that.
7026020	7027020	It comes home.
7027020	7029020	I learned about the Holocaust.
7030020	7033020	Okay, so let's go in to store quest.
7033020	7034020	Okay.
7034020	7037020	To the code area where we need to break the code.
7037020	7041020	I scan the other guards outside the front of storage quest.
7041020	7044020	No, there's cameras, barbed wire.
7044020	7045020	That's it.
7045020	7046020	All right.
7046020	7048020	Mercy, you're a face person.
7048020	7050020	Why don't you walk up there and use your charms
7050020	7052020	and see how far we can get through.
7052020	7053020	We'll cover you from behind.
7053020	7056020	Well, I would, but I think don't we need to sing
7056020	7058020	to open this lock?
7058020	7060020	Isn't that what Hank said?
7060020	7063020	Well, right now you're just at the customer facing entrance.
7063020	7064020	Oh, okay.
7064020	7065020	All right.
7065020	7066020	Okay.
7066020	7068020	We have to get into the storage facility to find,
7068020	7070020	imagine where all the MP3s are being stored.
7070020	7075020	And Mercy, we're all listening to you on our comms.
7076020	7078020	The code is blue.
7078020	7080020	If you say bluebird, we'll light the place up.
7080020	7081020	All right.
7081020	7082020	Okay.
7082020	7083020	Okay.
7083020	7084020	I got it.
7084020	7085020	All right.
7085020	7086020	So I walk to the customer service.
7086020	7089020	You walk to the door and open it.
7089020	7091020	There's a guy behind a counter.
7091020	7093020	He's not paying attention.
7093020	7094020	Oh.
7094020	7096020	Oh, hello.
7096020	7097020	Hey.
7097020	7099020	There's a lady here wishing to speak with you.
7099020	7100020	Oh.
7100020	7101020	Yeah.
7101020	7106020	So, you know, I hear there's some MP3s in this building.
7106020	7108020	Got any info on that?
7108020	7109020	No.
7109020	7113020	Just checking in to suggest that perhaps that's not very subtle.
7113020	7114020	Oh.
7114020	7115020	Oh, I'm sorry.
7115020	7116020	I know.
7116020	7117020	No backseat.
7117020	7118020	No backseat.
7118020	7119020	Face mask.
7119020	7120020	Not gonna Sarah know this.
7120020	7121020	Come on.
7121020	7122020	You're on your own.
7122020	7123020	I get one of those.
7123020	7126020	I mean, I like music.
7126020	7127020	Yeah.
7127020	7130020	You know, what do you know about music?
7130020	7131020	Oh man.
7131020	7132020	Let me tell you about music.
7132020	7135020	You ever heard of Freddie Frank's?
7135020	7136020	Yeah.
7136020	7138020	All about him.
7138020	7139020	Oh man.
7139020	7140020	I love him.
7140020	7141020	Let me tell you.
7141020	7144020	I got his latest data chip today.
7144020	7145020	No kidding.
7145020	7151020	While you're talking to him, I'm crawling on my hands and knees back below the counter.
7151020	7152020	No.
7152020	7153020	Don't do this.
7153020	7154020	Don't do it.
7154020	7155020	What do you do?
7155020	7156020	Don't do this.
7156020	7157520	This is a mission that's the right size for us.
7157520	7159020	And you want to go into this place.
7159020	7160020	Back back out.
7160020	7161020	I should back.
7161020	7162020	Okay.
7162020	7163020	I cry.
7163020	7164020	Do it.
7164020	7165020	Do it.
7165020	7166020	You're doing great.
7166020	7167020	No, no.
7167020	7168020	Come back.
7168020	7169020	Are you saying Camille don't do this or me?
7169020	7170020	No, I'm telling you.
7170020	7171020	Do you keep doing it?
7171020	7172020	You did stop telling him to not do it.
7172020	7173020	We just walk into this facility.
7173020	7174020	This is not like a secret facility.
7174020	7175020	But there's movement.
7175020	7176020	She's.
7176020	7177020	I'm calling.
7177020	7178020	I'm calling it.
7178020	7179020	We don't need to infiltrate.
7179020	7181020	They don't just walk into a 7-11.
7181020	7184020	He's not going to let us break into a storage facility.
7184020	7185020	We're not breaking in.
7185020	7186900	We're entering into the area.
7186900	7193060	While this is going on, I'm accessing my potential to dig into cyberware, to see if
7193060	7197060	there is a digital log that might tell us where such contents are manifest of some
7197060	7199900	sort that would tell us where such things are stored.
7199900	7200900	Great.
7200900	7201900	Thank you.
7201900	7202900	Okay.
7202900	7203900	Now I'm just on my hands and knees below the counter.
7203900	7204900	Stay there.
7204900	7205900	Stay there.
7205900	7206900	I'm okay.
7206900	7207900	All right.
7207900	7211820	So you find some public records, but nothing specific, nothing that says anything about
7211820	7214900	the kind of cargo a unit might have stored.
7214900	7216940	It's not something they keep track of.
7216940	7219780	But the guy, he's behind the counter and he's looking.
7219780	7223420	He's looking down at his counter and he's like, I'm seeing there's like, is there someone
7223420	7224420	crawling right under?
7224420	7225420	I told you.
7225420	7226420	Bluebird.
7226420	7227420	Bluebird.
7227420	7228420	Bluebird.
7228420	7229420	I go in.
7229420	7230420	I want to.
7230420	7231420	I want to.
7231420	7232420	I want to.
7232420	7233420	Oh, that's yours.
7233420	7234420	Yeah.
7234420	7235420	Bluebird yourself.
7235420	7236420	Yeah.
7236420	7237420	I can.
7237420	7238420	I can.
7238420	7239420	I can.
7239420	7240420	I can.
7240420	7241420	I can.
7241420	7242420	I can.
7242420	7243420	I can.
7243420	7244420	I can.
7244420	7245420	He just got a stun baton on this guy.
7245420	7246480	I just got a stun baton of him.
7246480	7249580	I'm sorry, Mercy, Are you really attacking the stand?
7249580	7250860	We will give him mercy.
7250860	7252920	Is he behind glass or an enclosure or just this?
7252920	7253920	These are the regular key.
7253920	7256940	I jump up and I shoot him in the chest.
7256940	7257960	No.
7257960	7259380	Stun dart.
7259380	7260380	Stun dart.
7260380	7261380	I shot.
7261380	7262380	I shot.
7262380	7264680	Are you shooting him with the stun gun after you've killed him?
7264680	7266720	I c� it's going to work.
7266720	7273000	IANS she bubba go storii questions, and I can't think of anything good.
7273000	7274000	Storii this.
7274000	7275000	Storii this.
7275000	7276000	Storii this.
7276000	7277000	Storii this.
7277000	7278000	Electricity in your chest.
7278000	7280580	I was zap and I just shotgun him right in the chest.
7280580	7285200	Using their physical agility and acrobatics, I grab hold of my grenade launcher, jump in,
7285200	7289080	do a combat roll, stand up and do absolutely nothing.
7289080	7291280	Alright.
7291280	7292680	I have a code of honor.
7292680	7296160	I can't fight someone who hasn't hurt me first.
7296160	7297160	That's true.
7297160	7298400	So I do nothing to the corpse.
7298400	7299400	Alright.
7299400	7300960	We don't know what's happening.
7300960	7304040	We don't even know if I've stunned this guy yet, right?
7304040	7309560	You guys simultaneously stun baton and stun gun him right in the heart.
7309560	7312720	He goes down real hard.
7312720	7319360	It's a million dollar baby situation.
7319360	7323720	I haven't seen that movie, but it's not Wizard of Oz.
7323720	7324720	It's a laugh riot.
7324720	7325720	It's a laaaaaaff riot.
7325720	7330160	It's a bit of a laugh, but Morgan Freeman gets what he deserves, which is a bit of screen
7330160	7331160	time.
7331160	7332160	Alright.
7332160	7334160	So we got this guy down.
7334160	7335160	Let's move.
7335160	7336160	Let's move.
7336160	7337160	Let's move.
7337160	7338160	Let's find this MP3 door.
7338160	7339160	Alright.
7339160	7340160	Dr. Friend, is he dead?
7340160	7341160	We'll figure it out later.
7341160	7342160	I'll check his pulse.
7342160	7343160	Oh, there's no pulse.
7343160	7344160	Oh.
7344160	7345160	Yeah.
7345160	7346160	He's just...
7346160	7350160	Guys, he's dead for no reason.
7350160	7354160	Alright, let's make it for a reason and get those MP3s.
7354160	7355160	Come on.
7355160	7356160	Let's go.
7356160	7357160	Move people.
7357160	7358160	Move people.
7358160	7359160	Look alive.
7359160	7360160	This is a public facility.
7360160	7361160	This is a public facility.
7361160	7362160	I turned him to my pep talk.
7362160	7363160	We're going to do great.
7363160	7364160	And there's lots to be lost.
7364160	7365160	You walked through the door.
7365160	7366160	Now you're in the actual storage.
7366160	7367160	We could have walked into this door.
7367160	7368160	He wouldn't have let us through.
7368160	7369160	There's people everywhere.
7369160	7370160	Would he have let us through?
7370160	7381160	Did you guys ever visit a storage facility?
7381160	7384160	It's a commercial public enterprise.
7385160	7390160	You can't just go into other people's storage unless you're Jodie Foster.
7390160	7392160	You could crawl under and think you have a warrant.
7392160	7393160	I don't know what that reference is.
7393160	7395160	Silence of the Lambs!
7395160	7401160	Using my powers to detect enemies, I'm surveying the area to see if there's any threat.
7401160	7404160	But also being a precog, I know that there is none.
7404160	7409160	I just want to be part of the team.
7409160	7411160	I try and give the guy a first aid.
7411160	7413160	Well, he's dead.
7414160	7416160	Second aid.
7419160	7422160	Has that ever been done?
7422160	7424160	You think that we're out of that by now.
7424160	7430160	I want you all to stand here and look at his face for 30 seconds before we go in.
7430160	7432160	We don't have time.
7432160	7433160	No, we didn't.
7433160	7434160	We did it.
7434160	7436160	Have you looked at his face?
7436160	7438160	Let's find those MP3s.
7439160	7441160	MP3.
7441160	7444160	MP3.
7444160	7446160	MP3.
7446160	7447160	MP3.
7447160	7448160	Okay, fuck it.
7448160	7449160	Let's find it.
7449160	7451160	What did those lessons do?
7451160	7453160	Save it for the night.
7453160	7454160	MP3.
7454160	7456160	All right, MP3.
7456160	7459160	If you're in the system, find any mysterious...
7459160	7462160	I know there's no thing that says there's MP3s in the storage unit,
7462160	7465160	but there's got to be a mysterious one, right?
7465160	7467160	Haven't we been to this specific locker before?
7467160	7468160	No.
7468160	7469160	Okay.
7469160	7474160	Using my ability to type in again to computer records,
7474160	7478160	I am looking for anything that seems to be obscured in its description,
7478160	7480160	anything that might be obfuscative or strange.
7480160	7483160	And while he's doing that, I take off the dead guy's clothes
7483160	7484160	and put him on and take his place.
7484160	7485160	Die hard style.
7485160	7488160	By the way, having been a pre-gog and looked at his face for 30 seconds,
7488160	7490160	I can tell you that he was guilty of a pre-crime
7490160	7492160	and would have done something terrible
7492160	7495160	to a child or a pre-teen in a month.
7495160	7496160	You see?
7496160	7498160	Oh!
7501160	7502160	Wow.
7502160	7503160	Yeah.
7503160	7505160	We're heroes.
7505160	7508160	I wasn't saying I like everything this guy does.
7508160	7511160	I was just saying he didn't deserve to die in that moment.
7511160	7514160	I didn't know he was into what he said he was going to be into.
7514160	7515160	So you're pro, right?
7515160	7516160	That he'd been a friend of mine.
7516160	7518160	I would have told him to run.
7518160	7519160	This is...
7519160	7520160	Okay.
7520160	7521160	No, I'm not...
7521160	7523160	Hey, I'm not pro-rape.
7523160	7525160	Whoa, somebody protest too much.
7525160	7527160	No, I'm not.
7527160	7530160	It's almost like you're forcing us to accept that you're not pro-rape
7530160	7532160	but we don't have anything to say about it.
7532160	7534160	You guys got lucky that he was into rape.
7534160	7536160	You're being very forceful about this argument right now.
7536160	7537160	He could have been not into rape.
7537160	7538160	We didn't know.
7538160	7539160	Whatever.
7539160	7541160	I'm taking off my clothes and I'm putting on this guy's...
7541160	7542160	You're wearing a rape...
7542160	7544160	You're wearing rape clothes.
7544160	7546160	And I chose to wear them.
7546160	7549160	That's what people like you don't understand.
7550160	7551160	It's called agency.
7551160	7554160	No, in a rape, someone is making a choice.
7554160	7556160	Are you in the system?
7556160	7558160	Are you in the system right now?
7558160	7559160	It's the wrong...
7559160	7561160	Anyway, let's not...
7561160	7563160	I'm just saying this guy shouldn't have died anyway.
7563160	7565160	Or maybe he should have because he was going to do...
7565160	7567160	I'm in the system.
7567160	7570160	But the FTR, for the record,
7570160	7573160	anything you would like to know, you could possibly know.
7573160	7575160	So if you are worried about the possibilities of his clothes,
7575160	7578160	I could tell you what he may be able to do in the future.
7578160	7580160	But otherwise, looking at the system,
7580160	7583160	I can tell you that most of this data was put together
7583160	7587160	by someone working part-time
7587160	7591160	who was going to an extension school.
7591160	7593160	And so the information is not complete
7593160	7595160	because this is not their first priority.
7595160	7597160	We need a real hacker.
7597160	7599160	Like an actual...
7599160	7601160	Someone less empathic.
7601160	7604160	Yeah, he's like worried about the guys.
7604160	7605160	A college career.
7605160	7607160	Why do we keep not bringing a hack guy?
7607160	7609160	That guy whose hack is in his name.
7609160	7611160	Can hack a remote hack?
7611160	7612160	Hey, guys.
7612160	7615160	Oh, shit!
7615160	7618160	Cliffhanger!
7618160	7619160	All right.
7619160	7622160	So, Alan, it's kind of like that except there's swords,
7622160	7626160	but it's also different,
7626160	7629160	and it'll be in a different room and different people,
7629160	7632160	and you'll figure it out.
7632160	7634160	Alan's with everybody.
7635160	7638160	Thank you, Marissa. Thank you, Jamor.

7652160	7653160	I think it was a Michael.
7653160	7655160	And Dr. Spur.
7655160	7657160	And Dr. Spur.
