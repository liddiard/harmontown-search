82960	90080	i got him in my pocket okay yeah just want to just want to wrap at the top of the show
90080	96960	just to get the uh the pump primed let's hit that beat again all right so uh all right
99440	109600	here's the uh top of the show top show uh all right so you've watched nature shows about bees
109600	116480	you've heard about bees here's this here's this rule you've heard killer bees regular bees that
116480	122160	you've agitated whatever you know you see the list of things to do and don't bees are attacking
122160	127840	you don't do this what's the thing you know you know where i'm going uh uh because it's
127840	135520	the weird bee rule that intrigues we all know this uh you know it don't if bees are chasing you
136480	143440	don't jump in water don't jump in water don't do it don't don't absolutely under no circumstances
143440	149920	if a swarm of killer bees are chasing you do and you happen to be near a nice pool of water don't
149920	155680	jump into it because uh and then and then you go oh really why so that's like that rule like where
155680	160240	you're if you're dying of thirst in the ocean and like even though you're surrounded by salt water
160320	166800	don't drink the water which then you you find out why oh it's salt water you will dehydrate
166800	170800	yourself even faster than if you just don't drink water this this rule is a little different though
170800	179520	because you go oh why why why why with the bees well because um they could and it's it's they
179520	187760	always use this this phrase they they could be waiting for you when you come up because they can
187760	191280	detect the carbon dioxide coming out of your mouth that's why they say when you're running
191280	197600	away from bees they're trying to kill you do zigzag wrap your head in a shirt cover your head
197600	203440	for god's sakes cover your head cover your mouth and your nose they can track you by the carbon
203440	212640	dioxide you're emitting do not under any circumstances jump into water because what it magnifies your
212640	218400	carbon dioxide emissions no it they might be waiting for it when you come back up but mother
218400	226400	fucker i'm also covering my whole body with water and and like what the fuck i like say it this way
226400	231120	from now on i'm sick of who you who are you targeting with this statement every b
231120	238160	the authorities every public service announcers google b attack every b article google every
238160	244240	fucking b google national biograph you're on notice every b article anybody anybody that has
244240	250000	ever written or has ever how should they phrase it about b attacks and how to survive them from
250000	256480	now on when you before you copy and paste because i know that's what you're doing don't jump into
256480	267600	water uh just just just just amend it to this if it's a choice between water and your house
268480	276000	go in your house right you'll be safer there in the house than in the water if you're in a
276000	281040	fucking desert and you're running from goddamn killer it's not gonna be any water and there's
281040	289200	of some water okay jump the fuck in it it's there for you i got you know you want to hear
289200	294880	i have some coyote tips you want to hear my b tips coyote tips what are your b tips you're covering
294880	301040	your head with your shirt right uh-huh because you're supposed to jump in the water keep the
301040	307280	shirt over your head poke your head out of the water covered by the now wet shirt you got a bubble
307920	314400	bubble i mean there's a million there's a million ways to use water to avoid a b attack and everyone's
314400	320880	so fucking uh taken with their observation that the bees could be waiting for you when you come
320880	326720	out i i don't care if they could be waiting for me also anytime you're ever escaping anything
326720	331360	the thing you're escaping could be waiting for you at some point it's even they even say could be
331360	336960	which means i i'm gonna say a lot of times not i'm gonna say a lot of times if you jump into water
337280	342160	killer bees are like ah fuck it i think what are we going to play the track his carbon dioxide
342160	349600	sting his nose every three minutes game until he slowly dies over six months yeah it would be scary
349600	354800	to have like one of those cartoon reeds that you use to breathe when you're hiding in a pond
354800	359680	and then the bees all pour into that yeah i'm pretty sure that was like a tom and jerry cartoon
360160	366800	that's that's scary i want to see the article uh about the guy who was in a killer bee attack
366800	374160	and ran and jumped in the uh uh water and because he jumped in the water not in spite of jumping in
374160	379840	the water because he jumped in the water he died well because if you're in the water and
379840	383840	you're underwater and all you're emitting is bubbles that's going to be mostly carbon dioxide
383840	387680	they're going to go oh this is this guy there's a carbon dioxide fountain right here hey great
387760	394880	guys right here so so don't go into the water if there's a house closer right don't go god damn it
394880	400640	oh look at that house okay lee proof house ah i see some water up there what a better idea than
400640	406960	the house so don't do that that's a way different rule you're gonna kill somebody with that rule
406960	412560	don't jump in the water what if that's all there is i just can't think i mean look i love honey
412560	418960	as much as the next person um and if i go getting in that honeycomb and i i agitate
418960	424320	the bees and they're coming after me that's already a rarified situation that's not a usual
424320	429360	thing but then now we're talking about there's a house and a pond like that's like like how
429360	433680	often am i around like just standing water anyway or a house in a pool but no we're talking look
433680	438320	oh we're talking about like you're cleaning out your tool shed and you're you move a sled
439280	445840	the and and there was a geese nest in the wall and they start they're africanized so they start
445840	450880	going like this fuckers trying to take our honey get them and you're like what i didn't try shit
450880	457200	just moving a sled bitches and then you're like running okay like like if your pool is closer than
457200	462320	your house by five feet okay head for the house take a couple more stings for the team
463120	470720	for your kids live to tell the tale with your coyote uh like punch kick maneuver do you let's
470720	478960	say that you didn't have house or water resources available to you a bunch of bees are on your ass
478960	485200	what would your like instinctive game master technique be to thwart them man i don't know
486080	490320	i think that we're talking about the wrong problem and we really got to be addressing
490320	496880	beyond bee crime well you know how you know how they work with those queens if the queen dies
496880	503040	then they start feeding uh the regular larva royal jelly but they don't just uh they don't
503040	507920	just make for one queen they they do a whole selection a whole row and then the first one
507920	516160	to hatch she uh she goes and stings all the other queens to death in their cradle but here's the
516160	524160	thing i stayed at a hotel this week uh that that boasted an apiary uh 120 000 bees and four queens
524160	527600	i was like jeez how did they have such can they have such control over how many queens there are
527600	532800	really i didn't know that was such a mathematical thing they're like our our beehives have four
532800	538720	queens and 120 000 bees come taste our honey uh and then i said i started looking it up i'm
538720	541680	like really they have that much control i'm like oh that's the whole science of uh
542320	550400	uh beeology or whatever is uh it is uh the uh this is the bee the queens will live like five
550400	557280	to seven years but the older ones they're not as productive so a beekeeper we think they're so cool
557280	562160	and they're just like gathering honey these fuckers are like the cia in the 50s they're
562160	566960	like they're they're like dipping and dapping in the government like they they just they'll they'll
566960	574080	reach in or they'll they'll wound the queen because if the queen becomes wounded then the
574080	578720	bees will produce more queens that are more vibrant but typically what they'll do also is
578720	583520	they don't even trust because new queens are just as shitty as old queens so they'll like trade and
583520	588800	buy queens and just import them and just kill the queen and then drop a new one in there and be like
589440	594080	there's your new queen and the bees will be like fine with us because we're fucking morons it's
594080	601600	like sim city you know what's weird about bees is uh they're like flying ants basically
601600	608720	whose avapositors have been uh adapted into stingers but uh they uh they don't do that pheromone
608720	614160	thing the ants have the pheromone trail oh they don't smell well honey bees you know they
614880	618880	they come back to the hive you see the documentaries where they do the little dance
618960	625200	yeah they do the little the little clockwork like they have an elaborate geometric code that
625200	632960	like indicates coordinates yeah that's fun it's crazy i mean thinking about the ways other animals
632960	637280	communicate with each other is always this mind-blowing thing to me because it's like
637280	641520	you know even if it's very simplistic and basic it's very crazy but it's probably not
641520	646240	simplistic and basic it's probably just impossible to truly comprehend on a meaningful level
646240	650480	it's pretty crazy that they yeah they communicate with each other but it doesn't all it means is like
650480	655120	go get some pollen like like all their whole language is just for nothing if anybody's looking
655120	659280	down at us they'd be like yeah look at all this shit they're bullshit yeah they love all these
659280	663920	memes they talk in memes but all they all they're doing is like moving the oil from here and then
664800	669520	yeah they're trying to get to mars but they can't cars are probably some weird thing like from
670240	674160	an outside perspective it's like they have all this car stuff that's going all over the place
674160	678720	and they get in and out of cars all the time i'll tell you what bees haven't done aside from
678720	682800	pollinating all of our flowers and giving us walnuts and you know all like all of the food
682800	692080	that we uh they've never sent a car into space no uh and by the way a bee i dare i challenge you bees
692080	698720	to send a car into space and show us what you got i can't wait like if this was a cartoon if
698720	705360	our life was a cartoon like the cutaway gag would be like like star trek enterprise is there
705360	710240	and then they're like having a scene and then the tesla comes and just smashes into the enterprise
710240	714640	and kills everybody like that's going to happen like i can't wait until our future society is
714640	718960	like taken out by that tesla because we didn't think about the ramifications of just shooting
718960	724800	something off into space so dumb they say that space junk is going to destroy all chance of
724800	728640	exiting the planet aren't the chinese working on some laser to go like blow up all the space
728640	733440	junk god i hope so there's so much space junk that we have all these uh astrophysicists that
733440	737280	are like watching the space junk to make sure we can launch stuff into space without it hitting
737280	743040	space junk because if we get hit by space junk it'll all uh make a chain reaction and cause
743040	748080	an impenetrable web of space junk that renders our skies unbelievable you know what ilan musk
748080	753840	should have done is maybe maybe he did maybe he did maybe he sent a car into space so he could
753840	760240	put all that space junk in the trunk right as this ilan musk shooting a car into space
760240	764400	in a country with a completely bankrupt space program that isn't doing shit
764400	772240	in a world that has a shelf life on it of like 20 to 30 years uh max uh the one guy who has a 30
772240	777920	year plan is like i'd like to colonize mars uh within the time that it's going to take for us
777920	782320	to eat through the planet like hey you can shoot whatever he wants out of space like like like
782320	787680	is that somebody like easy target like fucking things like all my friends like like rolling
787680	793040	their eyes and like uh i guess he doesn't care about starving children what the what in the
793040	797200	fuck you know how many people are gonna starve if we don't get the fuck off this shit whole planet
797840	803440	like the guy is like what what is he like what go pick on philip morris jesus christ the guy's just
803440	808400	a cool rich guy like flinging shit into space it's like how shit else is anything gonna get
808480	812960	done around here you gotta throw cars out there i don't know about you know he made those flame
812960	817520	throwers i don't know that seems kind of what are you trying to pull why are you making flame
817520	821680	throwers i think his joke is that he's a bond villain and that he like i don't know it's like
821680	826960	but if your joke is that and then you start like producing c4 explosives for fun and profit like
826960	832000	i mean aren't you just doing that i don't think that he's in the in the sense that maybe we are
832000	836240	i don't think that he's an out and out like liberal i don't think that he thinks that everything needs
836240	841360	to be regulated and and babysat stuff he might be something closer to a libertarian we probably
841360	848320	have political differences in the in that regard but the same kind of hubris is it like he gets
848320	853040	shit done and he doesn't just start a go fund me to say like hey if we all put our hands together
853040	858000	maybe we can pray and get into space and i can put it's like he just does crazy shit it's like
858000	862240	well i'll just make baseball hats and i'll fund an entire fucking piece of space equipment and it's
862240	867920	like people buy it like there's like he to me he represents the interesting aspect of like
867920	873760	like like when we talk about capitalism's evils we're really talking about unimaginative pieces
873760	878000	of shit who are cheating they're not actually capitalists they're thieves because they're not
878000	884480	interested in competing they're not interested in um uh uh you know like actual um stirring of the
884480	889680	economy they want to like miser their money and like use it to just like make more money and
889680	894640	they're like not even actually playing the game right and people who are like hey you know people
894640	899600	are greedy people don't want to donate stuff people don't want to pitch in so maybe if i said
900240	904560	look at this fucking cool thing would you give me a dollar and then everyone wants to be cool and
904560	908240	gives me a dollar and it raises all this money that couldn't otherwise be raised by sally
908240	913840	struthers crying into a camera and we use it to then try to further the species before it goes
913840	919360	extinct like like have some like hail mary or something like the guy does have plans no one
919360	925440	else has a fucking plan like like like the closest guy the second place planned to his
925440	929920	is i don't know some guy we had on our show that wants college to be more affordable and then the
929920	936000	third after that is a fucking nazi that wants to build a wall um who's that i ain't got no plan
937040	942560	charles flasher yeah we'll have him on as a guest to defend his wall but i don't know
944000	947040	his theory is that if you build a wall around charles flasher
950000	955760	it'll help it'll amplify his voice um uh uh uh all right there was a all right well let's
955760	963840	bring up rob shrob because uh okay shrob it up where's your music where's his music
967040	968640	rob shrob on the stage everybody
971600	978800	oh shit yo bow down and worship the man that you don't deserve rob
979600	986480	cheapy cheapy shrob hello everyone hello jeffrey what's up rob how you doing man
989120	996400	is it true that somebody changed your wikipedia page to rob cheapy cheapy because i saw a little
996400	1000960	something was it you no but i i didn't know if that was a honest it was not me i swear to god
1000960	1005520	would you know how to do it i i i mean i could probably photoshop it if you gave me an afternoon
1005520	1012320	but it i i that was either a bit that somebody was doing i pretty sure it's a bit yeah i don't
1012320	1016640	think you don't think someone actually thought they were correcting the record because i don't
1016640	1023120	really know how the vicissitudes of uh wikipedia work because my wikipedia page is hilariously
1023840	1029600	inaccurate so maybe someone could just go on and change your give you a nickname on it yeah you
1029600	1035200	can yeah yeah yeah but in the i mean we look i don't want to start rehash the argument but
1035200	1040400	it did it seemed conclusive that robs a cheapy peepy like from from that story like it wasn't
1040400	1046000	he got which yeah i mean think about he wanted to try dance ipad uh yeah think about it just
1046000	1050160	think about it i mean if you put it under the microscope i think that it's really really the
1050160	1055280	only thing you can conclude from that will you fucking turn your phone on that was my
1055520	1061680	i was texting steve all right wait okay lick look anybody else would do that he would hit the roof
1063840	1068000	hey yeah i'm trying to talk i've run a tight show i'm trying to talk and you're
1068560	1073520	yeah you've just texted you're killing your mentions off for fuck's sake
1073520	1077200	yeah nothing oh careful nothing but order around here
1077360	1079200	and
1085680	1094400	why do you make it it's a bond villain joke about it though what do you think people are going to do
1094400	1099200	with those flamethrowers clear we're going to hang them on the wall and say i got one of 20,000
1099200	1105280	flamethrowers that that hey it's cool that that the fucking historical dude made i think he's cool
1105280	1111120	that he's making space travel interesting again i mean we used to be so excited about it and then
1111120	1117120	those and then we all got bored by it yeah and we're like fuck this this is too boring and then
1117120	1122720	how everybody's going yay we're we're we're doing something futuristic again the rocket's amazing
1122720	1127280	the falcon heavy is an amazing piece of equipment yeah that's great you would have done it different
1127280	1132320	i i i i would have been sure it up washing it because it's so magnificent and then just the
1132320	1136560	red convertible it's like it's just like you couldn't have picked a more midlife crisisy thing
1136560	1141520	to put in space well he's going through his midlife crisis thank god yeah good but say that
1141520	1148080	but he's like oh he kind of laughed it up he he grew up he saw heavy metal as a kid and he never
1148080	1152720	i want to do that and he does this yeah and it's like it's like imagine all the kids going like
1152720	1158320	look i like like i didn't know you could just fucking do anything like like like like i didn't
1159040	1163200	for me the space shuttle was like that because it didn't look like a dumb ass rocket like like it
1163200	1169200	all of a sudden had wings so like a little remember them they would just be like these dumb ass rockets
1169200	1178160	man yeah remember that USA i think the player will come from here why you sound sarcastic don't you
1178160	1184240	agree with me fuck those things fuck you they look like missiles no the Saturn five is the greatest
1184240	1189440	thing that humans have ever built they look like a fucking missile and you know it they look like a
1189440	1197760	fucking dumb like god damn a big old dick because there wasn't a tesla inside it and it wasn't a cool
1198480	1203040	what do you want you wanted a suit to come out of the heavy falcon i wanted a big bucket of
1203040	1210880	viagra to pour out and just fucking just like what what says uh midlife crisis erectile
1210880	1216560	dysfunction more than sending your your hot shot convertible i know and yes and he had the fucking
1216560	1221520	belly playing i know it made people like space more but he had a ducker that to make you like
1221520	1226480	space remember relate to the space so it would have been better if he did nothing huh it would
1226480	1230320	have been better if he did nothing i i would have i would have liked to have been in the conversation
1230320	1235440	and was throwing a couple of their ideas involved jeff in the decision well he might he might he
1235440	1239600	you know we're we're more within reach of getting him on this podcast than any podcast i could ever
1239600	1247280	name you hear me marin uh and uh now again we're blowing it we're blowing it i would say again i
1247280	1251440	would have sent a instead of the concrete block that they use to simulate mass for the for the
1251440	1258720	for the payload i would have sent an enormous cufflink because i think that sends them

1515440	1521440	or you know like like like songs that that have toys ilephones in them instead of like kind of
1521440	1526880	saccharin cutesy pike yeah just sort of like the the the the the the adult adult children that
1526880	1532880	were starting to release like the biorx music the biorx i mean yeah yeah i i imagine twee being a
1532880	1537760	very subjective phrase you you could argue that biork was twee but then again she's also like very
1537760	1543040	you know like she's been around for a long time and you know doesn't just you're a fan of course

1567920	1574880	almost church was almost uh beside herself with gail's laughter no i i happened upon that scene
1574880	1582080	church was she was we were talking about steven tyler from arosmith and well we were talking about
1582080	1588000	the beetles well the joke was involving the evolution of of people like screaming you know
1588000	1592640	like in songs and stuff like that and uh so like i'm still workshopping this is not a finished
1592640	1598080	product this is why we have podcasts let's hear your happy joke maybe read it tomorrow

1606640	1616480	arosmith use to make his irish coffee extra special it's worse than when i occurred you
1617360	1622560	it's gotten worse all right what was the original setup well it was just what's his favorite liqueur
1622560	1627440	oh yeah what is steven okay okay let's keep it simple what what is arosmith steven tyler's
1627440	1639360	favorite liqueur why that again is a fucking perfect joke that's a timeless you'll be telling
1639360	1647200	it to your grandchildren long after elon musk's tesla has fucking like degraded into the sun's
1647200	1655200	gravity yeah a guy who floats puns like that is offended by our roadster a space-bound roadster
1655200	1660640	that's collecting data about radiation and uh all kinds of spacecraft your job is to love cars in
1660640	1667520	space my job is to write perfect timeless jokes i gotta say i heard you tell that joke outside
1667520	1673440	the outside the the castle and um i didn't actually hear it properly i just heard like
1673440	1678480	the what do you call it the payoff the punch line no just like the the way the bant like the
1678480	1683600	way you talked and uh yeah and you were already repulsed and so no i had to fill it in with like
1683600	1689280	just my own brain based on your cadences and stuff and so my what i heard your version of the joke
1689280	1697360	was uh what's steven tyler's favorite vegetable c-c-c-cale and then i was like this seems like a bad
1697440	1704560	joke yes because you misheard my yeah no i didn't do it right don't get me wrong see there's jokes
1704560	1712720	at last like the parthenon still stands not in its former glory but that's eons of time has passed
1712720	1717280	this joke will be one of those jokes that we will all be telling yeah no one's arguing yeah
1717280	1724080	i have a question what do you guys church hates it what do you guys think dogs think music is
1724640	1730400	and do they do they understand that it's uh it's coming through a speaker or because they
1730400	1736080	they sit and act like it's fucking nothing but if a dog barks in a movie they lose their shit
1736080	1743120	well they i've got like music i've got a playlist that's like music for dogs i play that while i
1743120	1747760	stretch after my i play that like sometimes when i leave the apartment and i do feel like the dogs
1747760	1753760	fucking like it i can't i mean it's but it's weird it's like or there there's like i don't know
1753760	1758560	what it's basically class it's a classic music that has certain like tonalities in it that
1759280	1766480	relaxes the dog and i would put it on every time kate and i would leave so lolly wouldn't freak
1766480	1773840	out and feel sad because like my heart goes out to her because all we are are all she has is us
1773840	1781280	and we are about to leave and and i would put it on and it would work but then there would get to a
1781280	1787040	point where when she would hear that music it meant we're leaving oh and then she would get
1787600	1793520	she would put on the act get ready yeah here's this she would be like i'll just play a little
1793520	1798320	bit i think it's it's classical so it's really not i don't think the music would go on seven
1798320	1804560	days going to be like you can't you find them oh spotify has been paused because your account
1804560	1809200	is being used the dogs are listening to this right now
1814640	1823200	sorry this music would go on and then lolly would look at kate and i at the door like
1828320	1836000	he's acting dogs like really sad music this is the dog of music like it's got puppy dog eyes
1836000	1839200	this music yeah i kind of like it i've come to really like it because i shower with it this is
1839200	1844800	like the snoopy go home this is like i switch from two fighters to this after i after i've ripped my

1891360	1897520	i'm a dog but anyways i'm just saying like a dog is it a dog is there was a dog at the rustic in
1897520	1902640	you know and it's sitting there and it's like at its owner's feet and it it's i i get so distracted
1902640	1907200	because i'm like i'm trying to talk to waldron about the movie we're working on and i i what
1907280	1914640	movie can't tell you oh what movie can't tell you i'd go right over oh we what wow a movie uh
1916080	1926800	we're like what is it gumby it's it's as dumb i i have i i like i'm still writing
1926800	1932960	shit that dumb yes for hire uh which means for getting fired a year from now um but uh
1932960	1937040	i could i was distracted by this dog because there's a dog in a bar like i'm always i know
1937040	1941840	that someone's eventually gonna step on its uh tail or something it drives me nuts uh but uh
1941840	1947280	i was just watching the dog and it's just like is you know i was always fucking music playing and
1947280	1951440	there's people talking i was just wondering what is the dog like how does it stay sane
1951440	1956640	and also if it understands does it understand that the the jukebox is playing like oh that's
1956640	1961680	like a guy they like to listen to each other bark and then they must be really pissed like
1961680	1966080	because we're like when we get mad that they're barking they're like i can't fucking say
1966080	1970640	one thing around here like like these people are always talking well they're not talking
1970640	1976880	they're listening to talking well well dogs react to different sounds differently like lolly will
1977600	1981760	there'd be there's cars driving all over the place whatever people are walking down like that
1982720	1990560	down the sidewalk she doesn't give a shit skateboard she goes fuck nuts man she does not like
1990560	1998800	skateboard sounds which she hears the going down the side goes fucking crazy goes fucking crazy
1998800	2005760	here's the dump truck goes fucking crazy here's the bus i don't care i don't care here's uh a
2005760	2011920	bicycle i don't give a shit what is that that's gotta be frequency stuff like yeah but it's like
2011920	2017440	what we were talking about this like a couple times you know now that there's like hd screens
2017440	2022000	and things like that more and more dogs are paying attention to the screen when it was like
2022000	2030160	standard death right they didn't give a shit but now lolly will stare and watch tv with me
2030720	2037920	and will go absolutely crazy when any kind of cartoon dog yeah we can't watch it shows up animals
2037920	2042640	in it yeah i can't play video games with the animals in it no no no and it's not and it's
2042720	2049280	and it's dogs like brian from family guy which is a bipedal he's like holding drinks and he's
2049280	2057280	talking like that lolly will go cheats so she recognizes a non-quadripetal like if gucci walked
2057280	2063120	on the screen she would go crazy but would not give a fuck about making a intervention episode
2063120	2069920	and there was a fucking harvey just starts going ape shit and uh uh uh uh ken seeley's talking
2069920	2073840	and and he's like you gotta recover you gotta you don't understand is this a problem that your
2073840	2078880	sister has you gotta support her and harvey's like what is it harvey what is he you don't like
2078880	2084000	his enabling and there's like he's in another shitty intervention hotel there's a fucking
2084560	2092800	drawing a shitty drawing like just a minimalist fucking like zen crap art like hotel art like
2092800	2098880	idea of a dog like piece of art on the wall it was like a like a couple lines you'd use to make the
2098880	2108320	shape of a dog and he's like when i was when i was when i was editing the portuguese gremlin's
2108320	2113680	trailer for for community this is my favorite joke and uh it's you don't know it i've never
2113680	2121120	told it's not a joke it's more of an anecdote but i will continue anyway uh lolly was sitting
2121120	2125440	there next to me while we're doing it and there's the point where the the eyes change where it's
2125440	2131360	just like the the gremlin looking into the screen with its cat eyes which i went to a taxidermist
2131360	2138000	and i got like real like animal eyes and it's just the face going like a freeze frame of it
2138000	2146080	and its eyes change color lolly went fucking crazy just went crazy this this this like bobcat
2146080	2151840	eyed thing was looking through the magic window at her yeah i told the story i hear of that like
2151840	2159360	when i was married to megathy she uh she she recorded harvey and then she airplayed it
2160320	2166800	and then she recorded him reacting to him being airplayed and then she recorded that and then
2166800	2171920	airplayed that and i and i came into the room because the sounds harvey was making were so
2171920	2179600	fucking insane because it was like he was he was either losing his mind or worse gaining it yeah
2179600	2185520	he was i think he was consciousness was coming so so it's like honey if you keep doing this thing
2185520	2194960	has a jaw that can snap our throats in half uh uh it's only kept in line by its ignorance
2195680	2199520	so you're making itself aware it's going to be waiting for us in the kitchen one morning
2199520	2203360	with uh with the neighbor's head on a plate why don't you eat out of the bowl
2203360	2209920	what so wait a minute when you say he she's she's airplaying well you mean like she's
2209920	2216400	she's was she doing video of him and then putting it on the big screen yeah video yeah she had two
2216400	2223840	devices going was was harvey like looking at yeah he was he was looking at the back of himself
2223840	2228800	barking at the tv which had a harvey on it that was barking the original was you know it was like
2228800	2233760	enter the dragon with bruce lee yeah it was like infinity harvey and everyone and the real
2233760	2237680	life harvey was like progressively going like

2251120	2257360	like thing that barks or wind-up robot dog thing and put it in front of nigel and harvey
2258320	2265760	i can't i don't remember we i've done this with lolly like maybe three times in in my life with
2265760	2272720	her thinking like this will be cute she'll like oh what this cute toy we got like this dog toy
2272720	2278160	that was like all furry you turn it on and it walks walks walks and goes and walks walks
2278960	2289200	back bark put it down lolly hits the fucking roof she's just like jeez what is what is this

2310400	2315840	to the uh fans uh to put that to music at some point well it's like it's like send that to my
2315840	2323760	twitter account or to harmontown.com imagine if i brought in like a robot human person to walk
2324320	2332320	yeah well if octopus creatures came from outer space and they and the the flying saucer door
2332320	2336960	came open and they came out and they looked at us for a second and then they took some measurements
2336960	2343280	with octopus rulers and then they went they went and they went back inside and then that came down
2343840	2355520	like this fucked up like hey hello i'm from octopus world my name is frank it's like it's like
2355520	2360320	watching fucking polar express did you uh did lolly watch shape of water and what did she think
2360320	2367520	about it uh no she didn't yeah and uh she hasn't yet because she hasn't seen it she uh answer one
2373280	2382560	oh the fucking dogs dogs every morning we're going to light a rose every goddamn morning eight
2382560	2388240	o'clock i get up i work out because i'm fucking so early that's the early time and uh did you get
2388240	2394960	your big on same time every morning dash my neighbor's cat uh comes over uh and uh the same
2394960	2400320	same it's got the same schedule a cup of coffee it like hangs out the window hey fucking harvey
2400320	2407120	and nigel just like these guys like it's just like i i just what is it like what is it like
2407120	2411840	to be a dog like they just they're meeting that cat for the first time and each other for the
2411840	2415680	first time every five minutes like they're just so amazed that there's a cat in the yard and they're
2415680	2421920	just like like just yelling at it like are they yelling get away are they yelling get over here
2421920	2426480	like i had a cat and they were relentless they were harvey wouldn't leave the fucking cat alone
2426480	2432320	like i i i it was the i regret it for the rest of my life suggesting food to that i think like i
2432320	2441440	think like lolly barks at big dogs and any dog that stares her down like and i don't think it's
2442080	2450560	i don't think she's like i'm afraid of you so my reaction is to make a lot of noise and and jump
2450560	2456800	around and get you to run away because you probably will eat me and i think your harvey
2457680	2466080	thinks he's a small dog i think but but but i know that if i let him out when the cat was there
2466080	2470800	i know the cat would run away right if he came running out because he's a giant dog but i also
2470800	2476560	know and maybe this is to your point kind of but uh he wouldn't eat it he wouldn't like no attack
2476560	2483680	it he no he would terrorize it because he he's a fucking giant fucking moron but like like like
2483680	2488960	the cat would be traumatized but he would like run out he would want to he wants to play with the cat
2488960	2494720	why do you bark at something you want to play with why what is he saying like i think he's confused i
2494720	2500160	think yeah i think he's running up and going are you a friend or a friend but you look like you
2500160	2505280	don't you look you're not responding the way you should but friend friend no no no but he's caught
2505280	2510640	behind glass that's the other thing that sounds like they're the the weird selective ability for
2510640	2517840	dogs to be a part of our world like they understand almost perfectly where your front yard is they
2517840	2523040	they they have like this these weird they just blend into your world they understand what windows
2523040	2529040	are they know that they can't get through them so they just stand there and bark at them and they
2529040	2534240	they don't even ever try to like bang their head against the glass to get through it they don't
2534240	2540320	forget that glass is is an invisible barrier but they don't remember what the fucking cat is
2540320	2545920	they're just like so goddamn amazed that it's a cat silver silver man had like a great theory about
2545920	2552720	like a dog's perspective of an elevator like they've got to think it's a time machine like you go in
2552720	2557360	the doors open up and now the furniture's different what's going on here all right i must be 10 years
2557360	2562720	in the future and i was like that's a fucking pixar movie you gotta do that i wonder if they
2562720	2568880	do that i wonder what's that movie called up i wonder if they keep track it's called it's called
2568880	2575280	puppet and elevator and the soundtrack is by steven taylor uh i wonder if they keep they but
2575280	2582080	they keep track of uh of of of puppet and elevator and all that stuff like we would if we were if we
2582080	2587920	didn't have certain advantages we would think it was a time machine but they're like i'm going up
2587920	2593120	three floors i'm going up like 30 dog units you know like they because they you know all those
2593120	2597120	stories about dogs that like they jump out a window and then they find their way home and
2597120	2601360	you know they they they like they're they're like always they have like a little gps in their head
2602400	2605840	so they're probably like oh i'm in a box and it's got no windows i wish i had a window so i could
2605840	2611440	stick my head out of it what's up with that shit dogs dogs you put a cat in a car and the cat's
2611440	2617440	like god damn it what the fuck is this god damn it get me out of here are you fucking kidding me
2617440	2622400	i mean i i don't i didn't want to be in a this small space involuntarily in the first place now
2622400	2628160	it's moving are you out of your goddamn mind i'm gonna piss on your face if i can like it's rare
2628160	2633920	to find a cat that's like down with a with a joyride uh they kind of either go catatonic or
2633920	2639600	they just fucking like freak out dogs they're just like i can't believe they stick their head
2639600	2643840	out the window they're into it why don't you be into that it's like the world is throwing them a
2643840	2652880	tennis ball they like lolly will look out the window and just be like it's insane if they're
2652880	2659680	into that shit that would be like going on here it's like my legs aren't moving but i'm running
2659680	2667200	really fast what is going on i can't believe they're just down with that well it's like if we
2667200	2671760	if we were experiencing something that we just didn't understand and it just kept happening to
2671920	2679280	us we would be fascinated by it yeah i would be well i know but it's like it first and foremost
2679280	2684080	i agree with the cat and the cats cats are smart too like cats never get used to it they never come
2684080	2689200	around and go like none of the other hand it's kind of cool to be really fast cat like and taste the
2689200	2694400	wind like cats love running quickly and cats love the world cats love to look at things like but
2694400	2700080	dogs are just like look man they just think there's just a weird canine relationship with humans where
2700160	2704720	they're just like i love stimuli like like the wind in their face like it's a lot happening yeah
2706640	2714480	smells yeah they're they're they're they're watching like they're watching five channels at
2714480	2719280	the same time so they you probably they you wouldn't put a dog in Elon Musk's car out in
2719280	2722560	outer space because there's no wind and there's no smells out there you know there's a bunch of
2722560	2729440	radiation which is data we're getting right now would you put data out in space sure sure i would
2729440	2736720	data's already out in space not anymore shows cancelled wow oh slow little mic drop slow
2741760	2748480	rob is doing the he's the he's the Geppetto of mic drop mic drop it's a mic teabag that's how
2748480	2752480	they do it in london that's how they drop the mic in london like a teabag
2752480	2763520	he's queen desert and you will be able to get all of your pumpkins for free this evening
2767440	2772000	my favorite part of that of course is the rift what a queen would say
2772000	2777120	that would provoke a mic drop which turned out to be free pumpkins you won't be getting your free
2777200	2788240	pumpkins i'm no world traveler i'm no geo politician i don't know what what's going
2788240	2794720	on in england but wow that is brexit is really fucked up it's a whole brexit thing yeah brexit
2794720	2800560	yeah there's been a whole gourd crisis you see that uh winston churchill movie yeah i saw it
2800560	2804800	yeah great performance really interesting as you said it's kind of like well it's like uh
2804880	2810000	it's like like watching an episode of uh what'd you say the crown doctor who this is called the
2810000	2815200	finest hour what's the gary oldman one what's it called the darkest hour i haven't i have the
2815200	2821440	screener i haven't was really amazed i obviously this is the whole point of everything but i was
2821440	2827120	like amazed at how actually true it was i don't know what i expected but like how like winston
2827120	2832880	churchill's absolute this guy who you've there's a million quotes from quotes that truly you're
2832880	2839040	like wow one guy said all this shit he's like the fucking vince lombardi of of world war two
2839040	2846000	he really had a lot of profound ways of phrasing this shit um and uh but and then you watch the
2846000	2852320	movie and it's like oh yeah that's all he did like he was like he just he just fucking talked
2853440	2857760	like this i mean i don't know what else i expected to see like a young winston churchill like vaulting
2857760	2863520	over uh uh you know with wolverine claws that were still bone and hadn't been infused with
2863520	2869040	titanium yet i'm impressed in the world that most of the great like actors now are from the adamantium
2869040	2875280	don't write in continue like all the big actors seem to be from like the uk or the antipodes and
2875280	2879440	like like like we had an american actor playing winston churchill that's kind of amazing oh i
2879440	2884080	didn't know gary oldman was american necessarily i mean he played so many like different characters
2884080	2888480	i didn't know i don't know is he i think he's i thought he was american i thought he was british
2888480	2893040	is he english i thought it was english i didn't know this you know i mean i mean well
2894000	2902800	john let's let's go did winston churchill and the crown and he is and he is american
2902800	2909600	and his mouth is a circle no it makes it out to a circle oh uh i don't know what you're talking
2909840	2916880	it's me winston churchill oh oh the only thing we have to fear is being misquoted
2919280	2926000	speak softly and have another quote misappropriated stop i don't know what you're talking about think
2926000	2933200	of one of my real quotes i don't know what you mean i'm off the circle oh oh daddy i'm winston

3140000	3145360	very excited about me and dan it's a documentary about about something that's not always talked
3145360	3154880	about in public feces it's a poop documentary it's a poop documentary they got their funny friends
3155840	3160400	talking about poop i think they delve into the history of poop what was the first thing that
3160400	3167120	could be considered poop like well i made that up poop i i i was that doesn't stop me from thinking
3167120	3171920	it i mean yeah you made it up i think that i mean shouldn't you say i think i remember dan
3171920	3176960	doing an awesome riff on how how it might start no i remember that being the actual part of the
3176960	3182240	movie oh you saw it as you riffed it oh but like i thought you were being so you've seen the movie
3182240	3187280	or you've not seen the movie oh i've seen it and it changed my life in the way i look at poop forever
3187280	3192640	is dan dan in the movie dan's in the movie everyone you want to be in the movie is in the
3192640	3199040	movie in a typical documentary fashion i i'm in the movie and i i accomplished the rare task of
3199040	3204560	making you hate me more than poop as a that's a joke for my fans who know that every documentary
3204720	3212560	and i come off like a douchebag um armand town the uh i think it'd be a mistake to make a poop
3212560	3218960	documentary and not put dan harmon in it exactly what other documentaries are you in i was in a
3218960	3226880	back to the future documentary where they used uh in over my protests i was like please don't

3232960	3238880	two sucks don't make me talk about it but you weren't the only one in that documentary that
3238880	3246320	said that i'm i well if that's true i i know they sandwiched me saying that between like
3246320	3252160	a father and son with different kinds of cancer whose sole way of coping with it is to celebrate
3252160	3257040	back to the future two and like a mayor who brought jobs to his town by building a back
3257040	3263920	to the future two statue and then in the middle is me going like it sucks anyways that sounds like

3414800	3422400	i have known you for 57 years it's true this guy i looked at my hands the other day and i went
3422400	3429760	jesus christ my hands are fucking looking old man and they were shaking they were all wrinkled
3429760	3437040	and i was like what the fuck happened to my hands what happened to my hands they used to be so soft
3438000	3444560	they're they're all wrinkled and fucking old i didn't i i i almost started crying i'm like
3444560	3448400	going what the hell happened can you play the dog music while he talks about his hands
3449120	3455840	because usually because i can't see very well relax i think it's going to be a nice i can't i
3455840	3460240	can't see very well so i'm looking at my hands right now without my glasses and they look like
3460240	3465280	you know what looking at civil shepherd on moonlighting close-up i mean they're all like
3465280	3471360	you know frosted glass looking they look pretty good i put my glasses my reading glasses my special
3471360	3478560	close-up reading glasses for when i want to look at my phone and read what's on my phone and i
3479600	3483920	turned my palm my hand around and i just looked at my hand and it was just like
3485680	3495840	i actually noticed how old my hands looked and i said it's it's it's coming it's it's almost over
3496800	3502160	it's almost over it's like you know when you when you take ecstasy for the first time and
3502160	3507680	it's the best feeling in the world you know you're just like oh my god and you peek and you go ah
3507680	3513040	it's great and then all of a sudden you start coming down and there's like this heartbreak of
3513040	3521520	like i just got here i just got here and i'm coming down that's what my life is like right now
3521520	3531600	i just got here and i'm fading out the dimmer switch on tribe is turning dim clockwise
3533680	3539920	check out randy and jason scalaris poop talk that's good that was great that was that was
3539920	3544480	fucking heavy you know what you know what always accentuates for me coming down from the ecstasy
3544480	3550880	of life is that that being the exact chapter of the party where a million strangers burst
3550880	3557120	in and point at you and yell privilege that's my favorite part of the party no
3559200	3563680	wait when you're high on on ecstasy yeah it's just a good well no when i'm dying when i'm
3563680	3571360	middle-aged i've been i was just commenting on also it's not a good time to be like we we hit
3571360	3576560	it we hit our peak and we were we we're and we weren't ready to you know for the whatever
3576560	3583920	the opposite of the the uphill downhill i think it is you know we weren't i'm pretty sure it's not
3583920	3589920	uphill we weren't ready to we were ready to be over the hill i i feel like i hit my peak like maybe
3592000	3598240	30 minutes ago with my steven taylor kremic account joke i felt like that was that's that's
3598240	3603040	me at mount Everest and now it's just going to be a horrible toboggan ride down at the bottom
3603040	3608720	but i was just saying like politically fashionably like partially probably because of the just
3608720	3613600	population dynamics because the uh the younger kids they're like part of a huge shadow of the
3613600	3620000	baby boom it's like a giant huge section of the population like it became open season on on old
3620000	3625120	people so it's like here there's kind of like a you hit the peak and then you start going downhill
3625120	3629120	and then you hear this war cry in the distance you're like oh man well at least it's downhill
3629120	3638320	and then it's like oh so fuck shit i am an easy target i thought i could like slide into like
3638320	3644000	retirement like by the old rules you know you're supposed to like be a old young white man and
3644000	3649440	like become an old white man and then you you you hoard your privilege and then you you have it in
3649440	3655680	your little sack and then you tip toe quietly to a wagon and coast downhill into a into a little
3655680	3664480	chalet i i might not make it like there's a there's a price on my scalp people know that this
3664480	3669120	is the route you take now there's there's there's uh i won't call them bandits because they might be
3669120	3674320	heroes i might be the villain but there's there's people on the highway they know i'm here they're
3674320	3684000	gonna get me this new purge movie looks pretty good what's this one what's it's a purge equal
3684000	3689520	prequel prequel prequels i'm coming up with the purge coming up with the purge it's called the

4001840	4007440	just completely independent of all anything like no one writing any of these articles knew
4007440	4014960	about anything else that shob had ever done but it was like just because kumail read shrubs uh
4015040	4022240	obnoxious uh uh redundant question tweets uh on on the air that was so long ago
4024560	4030240	jimmy kimmel or fallon or one of those things or no no no i think it was it was on harmonica i think

4043120	4048800	doing harmontown it's uh at least five years i would say i would say so long that it's sad but
4050160	4052800	it's good because we've gone through transformations because it's not really
4052800	4058480	the same podcast i listened to the cheapie peepy episode uh earlier today really insulting it's
4058480	4064800	hurtful really it's actually really good i really enjoyed it sad said that you feel comfortable
4064800	4069120	enough to talk to people like that that's why i'm a little lighter now this one will suck i'm sure
4069120	4074240	because in that one you can hear me going this episode sucks like whoa this episode sucks i was
4074240	4079920	wrong the whole time it's it's like gold it's gold cheapie peepy it's like top 10 top 10 it's
4079920	4085600	a top 10 episode yeah we can't follow cheapie peepy with music for dogs no this has been awful
4085600	4088800	probably because i'm in high spirits i don't know there might be something maybe i need to be an
4088800	4092320	abbot you know maybe that's my thing i'm complaining the whole time i'm like oh you guys are picking
4092320	4096160	on me i hate you i'm annoyed with you i wish i wish my podcast was better you know like maybe my
4096160	4101760	lot in life is just to be miserable i don't know maybe when i'm happy that's what i think uh uh or
4101760	4110320	my therapist says dan when you're certain you're in trouble dan harman you're better off not being
4110320	4116400	certain that's when you excel when you don't know things when you're confused people need you to be
4116400	4123920	uncertain you not everybody you dan when you're certain like every time you think you know
4123920	4130320	something for sure just stop just go soak your head in a bucket and you were like how much does
4130320	4136400	this cost i think it's two dollars i thought it was great advice although it's not really
4136400	4139680	advice you can follow because when i'm certain of something i'm like i don't need to follow that
4139680	4144240	advice in this situation i'm certain of it like i can't really follow it right well that's why
4144240	4148400	she's telling you but i always do realize that she's fucking right like i look back and i go
4148400	4152480	yeah there you were you you definitely thought you knew what the fuck you were doing it's like
4152480	4156880	you're just gonna speed that up it's like the mobius strip of your dry erase board advice to
4156880	4163360	your high self yeah like you you can't listen to hi dan but hi dan knows what he's talking about
4167440	4173280	that's a deep cut reference what remember dan's office back in the commonwealth apartment i had
4173280	4182240	a note on my whiteboard and it said dear hi dan or no dear non-high dear not hi dan don't get high
4183040	4188880	it makes you feel like you're having a heart attack signed hi dan and then jeff saw it while
4188880	4196400	we were getting high and he's like what's this that's a note i wrote uh well well hi a and to
4196400	4200000	remind myself he's like but we're getting high i was like well i'm not gonna listen to this guy he's
4200000	4208240	hi yeah he's acting all you still have heart palpitations when you smoke uh the the fucking
4208720	4215840	well the advent of uh vape pens vape life oh so so it's really controllable it was the paper that
4215840	4220560	was uh no i think it's just i think it's just in general like when you're willing that vape
4220560	4228560	it's well grown weed is uh that's rolled into a thing and it's an herb it as as opposed to a
4228560	4234480	cartridge you buy from a fucking 7-eleven that's like that's all the same oil like i just think
4234480	4239680	i've learned i still every once in a while i get too high if i get too high for 20 minutes i'll
4239680	4246240	check my pulse because that way if my pulse stops i'll go go you'll be the first to know
4246240	4255600	first to know is is there ever been in have you ever read anywhere online in a book
4256960	4264240	milk carton what have you of somebody having a heart attack because of of gunge no i mean like
4264320	4268560	the fatality the fate it's like that's the running joke with weed or not running joke
4268560	4273520	the fact that we joke about it says sit down there's no no one dies from fucking weed you
4273520	4277840	you'd have to you'd have to you'd have to suffocate in it you'd have to be dropped
4277840	4281840	into a silo full of weed that doesn't give you any comfort it doesn't give you no it doesn't
4283520	4287360	he's high i think it's what people it took me a long time to realize that that's what older guys
4287360	4291760	when i was younger and they would say i can't smoke weed as much anymore it makes me paranoid
4291760	4295520	and i always thought they meant i was i would always be like really police are coming yeah
4295520	4299440	can't you just not know the police are coming or know that the police aren't coming because i
4299440	4305200	thought paranoia meant like hallucinations like but i think paranoia is just like a catch-all phrase
4305200	4312080	that means uh something's wrong for me it does mean the police are coming like when i'm super high
4312080	4316720	and i'm like driving around anytime i see anyone on the phone i think they're talking to everyone
4316720	4320640	else i see on the phone and i think they're all talking to be about me and talking to me with the
4320640	4324960	government and stuff i mean i love the mr show sketch when they did they um so you're really
4324960	4331440	outed really over from the end of uh was it good fellows yeah the mr show the mr show sketch when

4379280	4384960	and i want to state this i want to start this off because i saying i'm not racist i'm getting
4384960	4393280	offended right now i am a huge like nightmare in elm street fan and i love like the screen

4458320	4466160	is going out and fighting monsters in buffy the vampire slayer esque adventures and i was and
4466160	4473040	it's called the west craven chronicles he plays animated series it's about west craven himself
4473680	4480160	west craving the director yes animated killing them killing vampires and they had
4481600	4487280	art yeah i remember it i could draw it if i knew how to draw it i could because i can picture it
4487280	4493280	so clearly and there's like this kind of batman the animated series version of west craven
4493920	4500960	fighting a yeti and and he's he's got like the salt and pepper beard and the hair slick back
4500960	4507440	in this kind of like like intelligent look on his face he's fighting like a mummy and then
4507440	4518880	he's fighting and i'm like and i'm and my brain is going whoa whoa whoa oh my god oh my god and i'm
4518880	4528400	going hmm oh okay all right put that right down there what's this oh there he is again
4528480	4534320	there's a west craven fighting an alligator person oh that's great that's great so it's uh
4534320	4540080	so this is this is this is this is a gut this is gut you get this so so and he's he wants to do
4540080	4546720	this oh yeah oh yeah yeah we pitched it to like west is totally into it lovely idea like uh-huh uh-huh
4547760	4554960	could i it just would help me put together like you know pitch or whatever can i can i take these

4561840	4567360	to dan harvish department stick to the flavoring the framing place and put them behind glass and
4567360	4574240	then just like a calm walk oh thank you very much i'll just be going out you're gonna go already
4574240	4580240	yeah i got so many ideas i gotta just gotta go you gotta take care of it let's open up the door
4581040	4586320	and it just like see charlie chaplin fast forward me run to the car
4595280	4596320	open the fucking door
4598160	4603280	dan opens up he's got a bathrobe and a coffee mug that says kiss me on monday and
4603520	4609360	just kiss me hair's up at a ferris ferris bueller like air and i
4612720	4618640	sit the fuck down you gotta hear this story and look at this visual i am not gonna live this
4618640	4627760	alone this is the reason we're friends and it was like insane and i was so broke as fuck i was so
4627840	4634240	broke that i went i i said i'm in let's do this and i you know and they were like well west
4634240	4640240	graven likes uh crossword puzzles so we think yeah that's right into it and he's also a bird watcher
4640240	4646480	so if you can get that in there too and i'm just like yes and i'm like writing and writing and
4646480	4650320	writing those last two details up or is that for real it's for real the crossword puzzle but the
4650320	4654320	bird watching bird watching oh my god i remember the crossword puzzle because i was like whoa
4654800	4660960	and and then and then at one point was this it was this west craven's idea or they're pitching
4660960	4666960	it this is what their idea because i never once in this whole thing never got to meet west craven
4667600	4675680	and which is sad because i i'm a huge fan i think he's brilliant i got the impression towards the
4675680	4682080	end that this guy was not an executive he was like an up and comer or whatever had an idea i said
4682720	4691760	let's put two and two together let's just do this and and and west was like yeah sure whatever
4691760	4695680	yeah i mean why say no why say no that's the explanation of everything that happens
4695680	4700240	but people so people say how did this get made or how did like why is hollywood so plastic or what
4700240	4704880	why does this happen or what other things the answer is why say no why would you ever say no
4704880	4710080	it costs nothing to say yes right right um it caught it ends up it costs nothing to say no and
4710240	4715520	it costs everything to say yes well okay but i was saying the opposite i'm just saying like you're
4716400	4721680	anyway like you could ruin your career by saying no to the wrong thing you can't ruin your career
4721680	4726320	by saying yes to the wrong thing until it comes to the point where because everything dies anyway
4726320	4730480	so if you're west craven and your assistant's assistant's assistant's vice president of
4730480	4735600	assistance is saying like oh yeah and also this thing i want to do is like it's you and a crossword
4736080	4740560	fighting a mummy you just you just you just say the fastest route to the end of the phone
4740560	4745760	call you don't pull over your car and go now hold on a second i'm west craven and i'll be
4745760	4750880	god damned if you're going to be interested in me and keep making projects about me for no money
4750880	4758320	while i drive my car around you just go yeah bye right bye i'm busy doing sounds great sounds great
4758320	4762480	love it and everyone and then every conference call that trickles daverly i was like love it love
4762480	4767280	it love it love it west loves it sounds like the crossword puzzle and the bird watching thing
4767280	4773280	sounds like his pitches no no that's definitely no yeah that's that's his underling sucking up to
4773280	4777840	him that's someone being like i am nailing this and they're nailing which oddly i want to say
4777840	4782240	don't you think now are you revisiting this right now on this stage and thinking actually
4782240	4789680	now post netflix post mindhunter post garb for post post just everything golden age post golden
4790400	4797120	like actually mike tyson mystery yeah like like like why not west you would have to lean into
4797120	4802160	post rick and morty fuck it you would have to lean into it where there would be constantly people
4802160	4808560	like going west craven how do i know that guy uh i'm a director what did you do i did a nightmare
4808560	4814240	on the same oh i think i think i don't i think this well you're talking about the consumer's
4814240	4817280	perspective i don't think so i think he's like he's like stephen king or whatever it wouldn't
4817280	4820640	matter it'd be like west craven you're like i know those words it's like kleenex or something i
4820640	4824720	don't know i think you know but the average person doesn't know what he looks like enough that if you
4824720	4831440	saw a caricature of him that you would go west craven no no no you don't need to it's the carrot
4831440	4835840	fuck the caricature no the name that's it that's all you start with and then it's that's why you
4835840	4841200	step on the gas with the caricature when you do a receding hairline and a gray beard and you you
4841200	4844720	you lean into it he's like dr who like dr who doesn't have to fucking like
4844720	4849280	be sexy and cool he's just like like like that's the thing is like okay crossword puzzles bird
4849280	4854640	watching which is interesting because that's ultimately what what the doctor is right he's
4854640	4859200	west craven he just goes around and he says it's a cool name and it's like it kind of sells itself
4859200	4865840	these shows called doctor who he's the character's the doctor uh but uh uh uh but but back then it
4865840	4871680	was fucking ludicrous because it it i still think it's pretty fucking well also you know that if
4871680	4876720	tomorrow if west craven was alive and because i know this because i've done these fucking projects
4876720	4882960	where you go like somebody goes like oh my god i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna do a
4882960	4888080	pretensey name that's like equivalent because i don't want to get in trouble by naming names but
4888080	4895360	like sorry like garth brooks loves uh community rick and morty whatever and you go like and he
4895360	4900240	wants he and he also loves animation because his kid's in animation you go fucking all right like

4916800	4921520	like mike nice it's it's like then it's all execution dependent the show's good or it's not
