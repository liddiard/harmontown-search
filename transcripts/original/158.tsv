0	18560	Now. Hello everybody. I am your guest controller, Ryan Ridley. Harman Town is now in session.
18560	35560	Please welcome your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden. And of course, the Mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
35560	45560	Thank you very much. Thank you for having me back. Here in the City of Angels. Did you know that's what Los Angeles means?
45560	55560	Yeah, of course. So where's the city part of that? Los Angeles. I know it's enough Spanish to know we're being taken for a ride.
55560	61560	It means the City of Angels, no? I think it means the angels.
61560	70560	Los Angeles is short for some ridiculous, stupid long name. Did you guys know that? Los Ciudad de Angeles?
71560	80560	I mean, it's at least four times that many syllables, I believe. I don't know it, so this is worthless.
80560	86560	I stopped listening because I'm a flawed person is why I stopped listening.
86560	91560	Well, I mean, you made the right choice. No, no, don't self-deprecate.
91560	98560	It was a dead end. How are you doing, Ridley? I'm good. I'm a lot less nervous than the last time I was here.
99560	107560	Still more nervous than Jeff, though. Oh, God, yeah. Of course. He's never. Is he ever nervous? Any time?
107560	116560	I think he channels it via tubes down his back, like an actual visible tubes down.
116560	119560	That's why he always wears a suit.
119560	127560	It's to mask his dune armor that takes his nervousness. It goes into his balls, obviously.
127560	132560	Because the more nervous he should be, the bigger his balls get.
132560	137560	Which makes you go, oh, he's not nervous. And he's like, not anymore.
137560	147560	Not thanks to Ball Direct. And some of you, ladies, and I'm not...
147560	157560	My strong, fierce, totally equal agency-addicted, Armenian females, you're going, what's the big deal with balls?
157560	171560	What about the puffy parts of the labia? Is that the... You don't go by just the part on the body where it hangs down?
171560	176560	That's an act equivalent, yeah. No? All right. Well, I'll keep researching.
176560	181560	I was trying to be an understanding man, but I guess I need to look into it a little more.
181560	188560	I know it's the ovaries.
188560	197560	Okay, so my lovely... Speaking of labia, my wife, Erin McGathey, or as they call her in her homeland,
197560	207560	Ern McGathey, she's over in Ireland right now. She left New York to go on a month-long vision quest?
207560	209560	You said something like, yeah, identity quest is what you call it.
210560	219560	I said identity quest because vision quest, we say that now to, I think, Impune. If your friend, Kevin, you know...
219560	220560	Sarcastic?
220560	222560	Yeah, you're kind of like, oh, Kevin's on his vision quest.
222560	224560	Walked about, yeah.
224560	231560	Walked about, maybe we should bring back. Vision quest is kind of like, we need to let that soil heal.
231560	238560	And let me shed an extra tear for the Native American people who came up with the vision quest, as far as I know,
238560	242560	only to see it go from being magical to hack.
242560	252560	Imagine that, they're like, now that? First my life, then all this litter in the 70s.
252560	258560	Now my comedic chops?
258560	260560	They get a tough break.
260560	269560	Now I'm the new Abe Lincoln, says a guy who's effectively slaughtered by Lincoln, slaughtered by him.
269560	275560	Every slave he freed cost an Indian a life.
275560	278560	Look it up. Don't look it up.
278560	282560	Don't look it up because I'm afraid I'm wrong. Don't look it up because...
282560	285560	Don't spend your night that way.
285560	290560	Don't look it up because you have people in your life that need you and neighbors that are afraid of you.
290560	296560	I don't even know how you'd look that up. What would that even look like in a Google search?
296560	298560	What would the results be?
298560	304560	I don't want to answer the question because you'd have to break it down into unfunny things about actual genocidal statistics.
304560	310560	Speaking of statistics, I don't know. I don't want to jump to that.
310560	317560	Erin's in Ireland and she's in a different time zone, so I don't know. She's sending me police brutality statistics.
317560	322560	So we'll check in with her department in just a while.
322560	327560	We've got Fred Fredrickson on the Fred floor. Fred, how's it going down there with all those Freds?
327560	333560	Well, the Freds are spread from floor to ceiling. It's a Fred room.
333560	335560	All right, Fred. More on that later.
335560	338560	Now we go to Steve. Steve, what's going on in Hawaii?
338560	346560	Well, I bet you thought there was going to be Steve's here, but I'm just in Hawaii. Back to you, Rick.
346560	351560	Fred? Fred? You okay? Oh, my God. Fred's drowning in Fred's.
351560	359560	Steve, do something. I'm in Hawaii, Rick. I can't do anything. Was your name Rick?
359560	366560	So she's in Hawaii. She's not in Hawaii.
366560	387560	She's in Ireland, Erin, and, you know, I have to, you know, I have, like, I was like, she was registering sadder things earlier before me,
387560	392560	and then checking in with me and going, you know, I'm leaving for a month, and I'd be like, yeah.
392560	400560	And she's like, well, are you sad that I'm leaving for a month? And I'd be like, yeah, of course. I feel things differently than you, you know?
400560	410560	Like, and I do, and I did. And then, like, an hour before she, her car pulled up to the hotel in New York, they're like,
410560	422560	I just wave of panic. It was like, maximum of three days ever, and I'm not seeing this person. And then I was so excited to text her,
422560	434560	well, I'm really bummed out. And she was like, yay. So, you know, I stuck her in a car, and off she goes to the airport to go to Ireland,
434560	447560	her ancestral homeland, where she's, it's a, you did the Israeli version of this. This is a, it's a goy kibbutz.
447560	455560	Much more dangerous. Not that it's a competition, but I was definitely risking my life more.
455560	467560	We must have talked about this on the show, but when you, I had all other friends that went to Israel and did the thing, and they said that there were decoy bus stops.
467560	469560	Decoy bus stops?
469560	480560	Secret, secret real bus stops down in a secret place, and then a big fake public Sesame Street bus stop for getting blown up.
480560	483560	So it still results in people getting blown up?
483560	494560	No, no, no, they don't send people to, no, they tell everybody, shh, just for Jews. The secret, it's a secret.
494560	504560	Look, I heard this from a Jewish guy. This is not me. I will be very happy to find out this isn't true. I mean, you guys sound like Smurfs a little bit.
504560	509560	Well, nobody told me about the secret bus stops.
509560	523560	I bet it was like one thing. I bet it was like a, I bet it was like a, I bet that's an urban legend created from somebody, from like one stretch of road where they built a, you know, like it was some apocryphal, like based on a real, one real incident.
523560	533560	The closest ever, I was in a bus stop in the West Bank and there was a concrete slab next to it and they said it was because of snipers, protecting you from snipers.
534560	535560	That was real.
535560	538560	Just while you're at the West Bank, cause that's where all the money is or?
541560	543560	That's the opposite.
543560	545560	That's where all the money is not.
545560	551560	When they, when they added the ATMs at the West Bank, they had to, they had to add a sniper barrier.
551560	553560	Oh God, Dan.
554560	559560	Get them while they're withdrawing their money from the West Bank.
560560	563560	I'm going to look it up later and I'm going to have a really smart conversation about Israel.
563560	566560	On the same site as the Indians slaves.
566560	567560	Yes.
567560	568560	Yeah.
568560	583560	So geopolitically I'm on it and my, and so what, what Erin is on is sort of a, yeah, it's the, it's the, she, it's not, she, it's, it's like a website that like, I don't even know.
583560	586560	I can't describe it without making it sound silly.
586560	600560	It's a, it's a, it's a website that pairs people that are looking to travel with organic farm, like nonprofit kind of a network of a non-profit network of organic farms or businesses.
600560	608560	And then the people can go and like, I think work for room and board, but then you get to just stay there for, you know, so, so at night.
608560	610560	You told me it was an Irish kibbutz.
610560	611560	An Irish kibbutz.
611560	612560	Yeah.
612560	616560	What's a non-Irish kibbutz?
616560	618560	A kibbutz.
618560	619560	What is?
619560	622560	The kind in Israel, I guess.
622560	631560	I'm not going to, I'm not going to describe a real kibbutz because I, I'm, I, it'll somehow, I'll walk over some trip wire.
631560	632560	Say something anti-Semitic again.
632560	633560	Yeah.
633560	635560	I'll sound, I won't say something anti-Semitic.
635560	640560	Talk in your description possibly be more offensive than the ATM fly paper bit.
641560	643560	Well, that's not okay.
643560	646560	I see you're drawing the anti-Semitic dots of like Jews and money.
646560	648560	I get what you're doing.
648560	651560	The line came out of your mouth between the two dots.
651560	654560	West, West bank bank.
654560	655560	It's the word bank.
655560	660560	Oh my God.
660560	664560	Wait, no one.
664560	669560	That was just a horrible coincidence.
670560	678560	Wait, so you guys were just hanging out in a world where I like hate Jews and, and then I think it's hilarious that I hate them.
678560	680560	And then I'm like, well, I got one.
680560	683560	They're getting their money because they're Jews.
683560	686560	Bro, I've been hanging out in that world for 10 years.
686560	688560	That's as long as I've known you.
688560	692560	Well, can somebody, can you put a special tone in the podcast recording?
692560	698560	Because if they're a test group, then 2 million people are about to think that I, and they won't wait.
698560	701560	They won't wait this long.
701560	705560	You can't delete the Vulture headline.
705560	714560	You can't unwrite the 20 pages that are about to get published in salon that you can write in 10 minutes.
714560	716560	I think they'll be fine.
716560	719560	I'm your Robin Quivers.
719560	720560	All right.
720560	723560	What's a kibbutz?
728560	733560	It's like a commune, basically, in Israel.
733560	734560	That's all it is.
734560	738560	Okay.
738560	739560	That's it.
739560	741560	Yeah.
741560	742560	Do you know what a commune is?
742560	743560	Oh, yeah.
743560	744560	Okay.
744560	747560	Very disappointing.
747560	752560	You go and you, you ho a, you ho a potato or, or what's a Jewish potato?
752560	754560	What's an Israeli potato?
754560	755560	A latke.
755560	756560	And oranges, actually.
756560	757560	What did you say?
757560	758560	A latke.
758560	759560	A latke.
759560	760560	You ho a latke.
760560	761560	You ho a latke.
761560	763560	I was like, say latke, it'll get a laugh.
763560	765560	And I was like, no, give the real information.
765560	768560	And I said oranges.
768560	770560	Or dates.
770560	773560	I'm just so shaken by the, the bank thing.
773560	776560	Like I, I was just like, yeah, I'm six years old.
776560	778560	It's a bank, right?
778560	781560	And everyone's like, oh my God.
781560	784560	But you were still talking about how the Jews were coming there to get money out.
784560	785560	Well, who cares?
785560	786560	Yeah, I'm not dumb.
786560	788560	Like I'm not, I'm not Peter Sellers in being there.
788560	790560	I'm not, I'm not like, oh, it's so innocent.
790560	792560	I'm just saying like my intent couldn't have been where it is.
792560	794560	Like I was doing dumb wordplay.
794560	795560	Yeah.
795560	796560	I can still call them Jews and say that they're going there.
796560	797560	I didn't mean that.
797560	800560	It wasn't making the.
800560	802560	Yeah.
802560	808560	Um, no, oh, no, no.
808560	809560	Uh, okay.
809560	811560	So Erin's in Ireland.
811560	814560	She's on a kibbutz, essentially.
814560	816560	Which you, you now know what that is.
816560	817560	I do.
817560	820560	And, uh, uh, she's gone.
820560	822560	She's, she's, she's, she's ethereal.
822560	823560	She's watching.
823560	825560	She's right there.
825560	827560	But, uh, I mean, on the camera.
827560	828560	Hi, Erin.
828560	829560	You can't touch her.
829560	832560	Uh, and I thought, you know, the car drives away.
832560	836560	And I went, I had a little, I had a little surprise cry in like a bathroom.
836560	840560	But like, and then I was like, but I really, and I pushed it down.
840560	842560	There was the wrong kind of laugh from the back.
842560	843560	Thank you.
844560	847560	We, we, we now live in a world where we know the different kinds of laughs.
847560	851560	That was, uh, that's the wrong kind of laugh.
851560	852560	I'm not, I'm not judging you.
852560	854560	You're free to stay.
854560	857560	But I know you are judging me.
857560	860560	And I'm calling you out.
860560	862560	Hashtag cancel the back row.
868560	872560	Uh, so, so I, but then, so then I suppress it all.
872560	879560	And I suppress it with the fabric of, I go, I get to play really, really uninterrupted video games.
879560	885560	Like, I don't think, and I don't, I don't, I don't think that, you know, Erin, the truth is Erin never stopped me.
885560	891560	You know, she was never the reason, but it's just like, I just mean with impunity, with no guilt, no shame, you know, like,
891560	894560	which is a dangerous thing because I have a lot of shit to do.
894560	897560	Like Erin would always be, she's like, it's five in the morning.
897560	898560	And I'd be like, so what?
898560	900560	You're not my real mom.
902560	906560	But now it's just like, oh shit, I forgot to feed the fish or something.
906560	910560	And I was like, stuff will grow on me if I'm not careful.
910560	913560	So, but, but still, I'm very excited.
913560	918560	And I, and I, I hook up the, the Shadows of Mordor game.
918560	919560	Yeah.
919560	921560	These kids know what I'm talking about.
921560	923560	They like, they like the Shadows of Mordor.
923560	926560	And they're going through the tutorial.
926560	932560	You know, every video game now has, you know, action video game has, has like the, the parts where, you know, they, they,
932560	934560	they sometimes they work it into the narrative.
934560	936560	Sometimes they just go, hey, here's a tutorial.
936560	940560	A lot of them seem hard pressed to work into the narrative.
940560	941560	I don't know why you couldn't just say.
941560	942560	What do you mean, the training part?
942560	943560	Yeah.
943560	950560	I was like, like, it seems like we were about 15 years in now of all video games being ironic and working it into the narrative.
950560	953560	I don't know if, I think they're putting too much effort on themselves.
953560	955560	I think, I mean, I don't play a lot of video games.
955560	959560	I'm talking about in Elder Scrolls when you're in the prison and you, in oblivion and you get broken out.
959560	960560	Elder Scrolls.
960560	961560	That's good.
961560	967560	That's like a good version of it because you're doing real stuff, but it's like the bad ones are like your friend Winslow comes over and he's like,
967560	970560	for old time's sake, why don't you wave the stick around?
970560	975560	Press A to wave the stick.
975560	979560	You know, I thought the weird, the weird ones are the ones where they're actually telling you,
979560	988560	I think the weirdest one so far is New Vegas because they, your character is waking up from a near fatal head wound.
988560	993560	A doctor has fixed your brain and is doing a checkup on you.
993560	996560	And so he wants to make sure your brain works right.
996560	1001560	So he asks you to associate certain things and the whole time you're like, well, come on.
1001560	1006560	I know I'm, I know when you ask me that what you really mean is, do I want to be a demolitions expert?
1007560	1012560	And also it's just weird that you're asking me to form my own brain from a head injury.
1012560	1017560	Like I'm always going to think whenever I blow myself up later, I'm going to be like, I bet I was supposed to be a sniper and I bet I,
1017560	1021560	and I bet they shot the judgment part out of my brain.
1021560	1023560	So I'm a monster in this game.
1023560	1028560	Anyways, the, so, but they, but they, they always walk you through, okay, here's how you crouch.
1028560	1029560	Here's how you run.
1029560	1037560	Here's how you, and one of the big things is stealth attack at the beginning of, of, of, of, of shadows of Mordor.
1037560	1046560	You're learning how to stealth attack, but they do a very clever thing because they're also weaving this horrible tragic thing with this guy who's lost his wife to orcs and goblins and things.
1046560	1056560	He's woke up, woken up as a half dead, a wraith like being who's tied to another being's curse to be a spirit of vengeance against these orcs and mortars.
1056560	1066560	Such an awesome game. And the, but, and, and so you, you, you're having flashbacks as your tutorials on how to operate the character.
1066560	1073560	So the way you learn to stealth kill people is like two minutes into the game where I'm like, all right.
1073560	1083560	Like I cried, I miss my wife, but fucking on the other hand, shadows of Mordor.
1083560	1087560	And then I wrote it down because it said at the bottom of the screen, you have it.
1087560	1099560	You literally have a bouquet of flowers in your hand and your, your wife is up ahead and it, and you, it teaches you stealth by you hiding so that you can surprise her better.
1099560	1108560	And it says at the bottom of the screen, while in stealth, press X to kiss your wife.
1108560	1112560	And I just started bawling.
1112560	1119560	I didn't start bawling. I fucking nailed her. I gave her the flowers because I'm going to kick ass at slitting people's throats on this game.
1119560	1123560	But, but I was giving her a flower that I was just crying.
1123560	1126560	That's like the equivalent of the wax on wax off.
1126560	1133560	Like you learn by giving flowers, like I remember on your slit and orcs throat.
1133560	1136560	You say for me or for the character of the character?
1136560	1139560	I think the character of the game learned how to slit throats.
1139560	1144560	They're not teaching you that he's learning how to slit throats using flowers on his wife.
1144560	1146560	That would be the craziest.
1146560	1149560	I guess that would be a leap, yeah.
1149560	1153560	That would be the craziest mentor in the world.
1153560	1156560	Because of his romance training, he's able to be an elite assassin.
1156560	1157560	Yeah, that's crazy.
1157560	1165560	Or because he's such a lethal assassin, he recognizes to kill his nerves, to love.
1166560	1172560	This is like a downer, but there's like a Call of Duty game where like you attend a funeral and you can press X.
1172560	1175560	You're supposed to press X to pay respects to the fallen.
1175560	1182560	But you can mess up, like if you don't approach it at the wrong angle, like you could press, it'll also pop up.
1182560	1188560	Press like control pad to vault over the gravestone, which is some bad.
1189560	1196560	I love those unintentional social, the things that, like all video games have that to the extent that they try to simulate reality,
1196560	1198560	try to simulate a world and individuality.
1198560	1206560	There's always these gaps where it's like it's hilarious, like unavoidably sociopathic, like the Witcher 3,
1206560	1213560	like you walk into a guy's hut and you go, hey, I'm here about the thing you put on the board.
1213560	1221560	Oh, yes, my Jessica. Oh, they found her bones outside the troll cave, but the blood trail let off the cliff.
1221560	1227560	I keep telling the preacher that her soul won't come back tormented, but he's making me tie this ear to a branch.
1227560	1234560	I'm afraid ghouls will come and try to eat me because they'll be attracted by my daughter's rotting human flesh.
1234560	1240560	So could you come with me and just stave off the ghouls so I can summon my daughter's ghost
1240560	1247560	and just murder her with the arms of her lover to banish her soul for all of eternity?
1247560	1250560	And I'll give you 20 silver pieces.
1250560	1260560	And then just one of your four options is like, how about a hand of Gwent, which is like this card game in the thing.
1260560	1265560	It's just like you know checkers.
1265560	1270560	You're asking him if he'd rather play Gwent instead, or you're offering him a deck of Gwent.
1270560	1279560	My punchline demands a really religious knowledge of Witcher 3, and I apologize for that.
1279560	1285560	I was on a roll halfway through and I was like, this train is not coming to the station, they think it is.
1285560	1290560	And I could have ripped something, but then you would have gone, why would you play checkers?
1290560	1295560	I'm really sorry about everything that happened.
1295560	1304560	But all those RPG games, they're always like, you know, they're just talking forever sometimes about like corpses and their ancestors and stuff.
1304560	1309560	And you can always just go like, what have you got for sale?
1309560	1312560	Because they just happen to also be a blacksmith.
1312560	1316560	Could you make me a hammer?
1316560	1320560	I have the idea of a guy that would really be like that.
1320560	1325560	Other people would be like, um, yeah, yeah.
1325560	1330560	Listen, about that thing earlier, here's your hammer.
1330560	1334560	So your wife, oh God, thank God, I guess you're just like a strange person.
1334560	1345560	But I hear, as I said at the top of the conversation, your reputation precedes you.
1345560	1349560	I'm very disturbed because I have shadows and borders and another great, it's like a Batman thing.
1349560	1354560	Hey, what's this, the video game show? I don't know. What did you think it was, Troy?
1354560	1358560	Is that somebody in the audience you're picturing? Yeah.
1358560	1361560	Raise your hand, Troy. And your name might not be Troy.
1361560	1366560	I hate video games and I love Dan Harmon.
1366560	1372560	So that person deserves actually a lot of attention.
1372560	1375560	Gee, I think I'm Troy.
1375560	1377560	You haven't played in a while.
1377560	1379560	But I'm just talking about it in general.
1379560	1383560	You don't have to have any familiarity with video games for this conversation to happen.
1383560	1391560	So as I've often said, the thing that I love most about these video games is inventory management.
1391560	1397560	I love, no matter what the game's like, I demand that it be really good with the combat.
1397560	1401560	I kill a little dinosaur, but I will always, like 90 percent of the game,
1401560	1406560	as anybody that's ever come into my home will tell you, it's just me, it's just a screen of tacks
1406560	1411560	and I'm just sorting cabinets.
1411560	1414560	And then once I do, I stop playing.
1414560	1419560	I'm like, these are my fishing rods, these are my magical swords,
1419560	1424560	these are my swords that I'm probably going to sell because let's face it, I don't need them,
1425560	1430560	I also don't need the money at this point because I've got to think towards your system.
1430560	1434560	These are my wolf pelts, these are my uncured wolf pelts because the thing is,
1434560	1439560	if there's a guy in the other town that if you sell him to him, he'll give you an extra gold piece.
1439560	1444560	If you do that a thousand times, that's a good way to spend an hour.
1444560	1449560	I'm obsessed, I become obsessed with these things that I'm not obsessed with in real life.
1449560	1453560	But then the only other thing that I like, Ryan.
1454560	1460560	And this is a segment called Dark Confessions.
1460560	1464560	Is there a music cue for...
1464560	1467560	I know I'm hitting you kind of off-card there.
1474560	1479560	The Shadows of Murder made me, finally I connected the dots because I'm like,
1479560	1482560	I like this game, I like Assassin's Creed, I like the Batman games,
1483560	1487560	these aspects of these games, I like stalking and killing.
1487560	1491560	I like specifically stalking and killing.
1491560	1496560	Not fair fighting people, not being honorable.
1496560	1505560	I like creepy, horrible, self-empowered, creepy, 70s serial killer.
1505560	1509560	Yeah, you don't remember because the one time I did play video games 10 years ago,
1509560	1514560	we were both playing Oblivion, and I found out that that was the difference between you and me.
1514560	1520560	Because I like to go charging into battle with a sword, swinging face-to-face with my opponents,
1520560	1523560	and you're like, no, I sneak up behind them and slit their throats.
1523560	1525560	And I was like, what's the fun in that?
1525560	1529560	Because it's like not playing the game.
1531560	1534560	Who is? The time to sneak?
1534560	1537560	I do, I do.
1537560	1546560	If you would watch me, well now you can with Twitch, but if you see me the way that I play video games,
1546560	1554560	I'm always like, I'll just find some fucking cabinet or like a little railing or something
1554560	1558560	where it's shaped weird, so I kind of wiggle in there,
1558560	1564560	and I just wait for the monsters to go, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr.
1564560	1568560	And then I'm like, coward bomb!
1568560	1572560	And it takes like two damage away, and they're like, rarrr, rarrr.
1572560	1574560	And I'm like, I got you, motherfucker.
1574560	1577560	Hole in the system.
1577560	1581560	It may only be two points of damage, but it adds up, baby.
1581560	1585560	So then someone will come in the room and go, what are you doing?
1585560	1592560	And I'll go, I'm slowly blowing up an elephant gorilla that I could probably kill with three hits,
1592560	1600560	but then I'd have to suffer the indignity of that fucking thing touching me, thinking that it's better than me.
1600560	1603560	I like these.
1603560	1607560	Shadows of Mordor is like, it's the ultimate, this is the thing.
1607560	1611560	This is why I now know what I've been doing with video games my whole life,
1611560	1616560	because Shadows of Mordor says it, you get your throat slit in the beginning of the game,
1616560	1620560	and you wake up a ghost man in hell world.
1620560	1623560	So you kind of don't belong there.
1623560	1625560	So everyone's expendable.
1625560	1626560	There's no guilt.
1626560	1627560	Everyone's an asshole.
1627560	1631560	You're an asshole land, which is run by the people that already killed you.
1631560	1632560	Your wife's already dead.
1632560	1634560	Your kids are already dead.
1634560	1638560	You have no idea what's going on, but there's a ghost man saying, you have ghost powers now.
1638560	1640560	Go fucking kill people.
1641560	1643560	But here's how you really kill them nice.
1643560	1647560	You get behind them, you press the X button, then you scrub their windpipe,
1647560	1652560	and you suck their life essence into your sword, and then you take your sword and you stick it,
1652560	1657560	and the sword gets more power the harder you choke them.
1657560	1663560	And once your sword's full, you can stick it in a stone and get a bigger hand for choking two throats at once.
1670560	1671560	Sold.
1679560	1680560	Dark confessions.
1680560	1686560	I fear now as a 42-year-old, as we enter the world of increased virtual,
1686560	1689560	now I'm my mom.
1689560	1694560	Now I'm ready to say, this is going to be trouble.
1694560	1698560	Now I'm willing to say, I think if a 14-year-old kid could put on a helmet
1698560	1706560	and walk around a virtual house with a knife and practice, being Michael Myers from Halloween,
1706560	1716560	that the kid, now I'm just old, but I get to do it all.
1716560	1718560	I'm like, fuck it, choke you in the game.
1718560	1722560	Wouldn't you be satisfied being Michael Myers in just the VR world?
1722560	1723560	You think you'd take it out?
1723560	1724560	I don't know.
1724560	1727560	And then there's the question of, well, if they have the technology to simulate that,
1727560	1731560	and then they have the technology to simulate you preventing it,
1731560	1735560	and understanding that it's wrong and stuff, which is what our current video games are.
1735560	1737560	I heard somebody make a titter.
1737560	1739560	Do you think that that's silly?
1739560	1741560	Well, there's something we'll do it.
1741560	1742560	Oh, wow.
1742560	1746560	Do you mean do good through video games?
1746560	1753560	I think we're kind of seeing that shift right now.
1753560	1754560	Wait a minute.
1754560	1759560	Michael told me he did Oculus Rift demos, and he said that one of them is you walk through a party
1759560	1765560	both from the POV of someone getting date-raped and also the date-raper.
1765560	1768560	So you kind of see like...
1768560	1771560	Well, okay.
1771560	1776560	And it was meant to be an educational, like, don't date-rape people.
1776560	1780560	Here's how you do it.
1780560	1784560	Well, I mean, the funny thing is that's like a new face on...
1784560	1787560	It was like empathizing with the victim or something.
1787560	1792560	The origins of pornography is like it had to originally start as like reefer madness.
1792560	1794560	You know, it's like show you...
1794560	1796560	Let's show you people smoking pot.
1796560	1797560	Let's show you what...
1797560	1798560	You want to come...
1798560	1802560	You're fascinated with pot smoking, so you're going to come see this movie called Reefer Madness.
1802560	1806560	We're going to be protected because we're going to be telling you blah, blah, blah.
1806560	1809560	And then pornography started as sex-ed kind of videos.
1809560	1811560	Well, look at Sally the Slut.
1811560	1813560	Here's how you recognize her.
1813560	1820560	She'll be chomping around showing gam when it's not called for by her job.
1820560	1824560	That's too much gam, Sally.
1824560	1825560	You just got to...
1825560	1831560	I hope you got enough more gam to walk to the skid row.
1831560	1837560	And they said, what if we take the narrator out?
1837560	1838560	Exactly.
1838560	1841560	That's the history of pornography, right?
1841560	1846560	They slowly were like, well, how educational is this?
1846560	1854560	I just came back from a test screening of Sally Slut and there weren't a lot of anti-Sluts in the audience.
1854560	1865560	A lot of guys demurely respecting the film craft by holding their hats in their laps.
1866560	1868560	Was that a positive fart sound?
1868560	1877560	I projected onto that and I just heard my older brother going, that's a sentence.
1877560	1884560	Well, it wasn't like a buckled over belly laugh is what you're probably hearing.
1884560	1887560	It was like a slow air escape from a balloon.
1887560	1889560	I guess that was kind of funny laugh.
1889560	1893560	But don't you do that when something's really, really unfunny sometimes?
1894560	1896560	Yeah, it wasn't your best work.
1896560	1897560	No, no.
1897560	1898560	And you know what?
1898560	1901560	I'm making it up as I go, you asshole.
1907560	1910560	When in stealth press X to kiss your wife.
1910560	1917560	That doesn't necessarily have to be the title of tonight's podcast, but it's words to live by.
1917560	1922560	I was going to call.
1922560	1923560	Oh, no.
1923560	1924560	See it.
1924560	1925560	Yeah.
1925560	1926560	Okay.
1926560	1927560	Nope.
1927560	1928560	Thought I had something to talk.
1928560	1929560	Nope.
1929560	1930560	All right.
1930560	1931560	Nope.
1931560	1932560	Nope.
1932560	1933560	No, nothing much related to talk about.
1933560	1935560	Rick and Morty's doing good.
1943560	1946560	The last of the leaked episodes airs tonight.
1947560	1948560	Well, yeah.
1948560	1949560	John Chinks it, baby.
1949560	1950560	Did anybody watch it yet?
1950560	1951560	The leaked episode?
1954560	1955560	Really?
1955560	1956560	Wait.
1956560	1957560	So which one is tonight?
1957560	1958560	Last week was the his ex-girlfriend.
1958560	1960560	No, no, that's tonight.
1960560	1961560	Oh, really?
1961560	1962560	Oh, that one leaked.
1962560	1964560	That's why everyone was telling me.
1964560	1966560	So it airs tonight.
1966560	1967560	Okay.
1967560	1968560	Yeah.
1968560	1969560	Oh, kids.
1969560	1970560	That one's a bummer.
1970560	1975560	These kids hard to write for hard to sell to and then they go and steal it.
1976560	1986560	And then you try to give them something they think will be neat.
1986560	1987560	Okay.
1987560	1988560	You're into that stuff.
1988560	1989560	How about an Apple watch?
1989560	1990560	They don't even buy it.
1990560	1991560	They don't like it.
1991560	1992560	They say it's dumb.
1992560	1994560	They say it's like a tiny iPhone on your wrist.
1994560	1996560	Why would I have that?
1996560	2003560	I need my free hand for snogging.
2003560	2010560	Polyamorous holographic snogging.
2010560	2017560	Speaking of shifting definitions and things, I don't even know what my job is in this situation,
2017560	2020560	but I feel like I don't have a job.
2020560	2021560	There is no job.
2021560	2022560	There's no policing.
2022560	2023560	There's nothing going on.
2023560	2029560	But I thought it was an interesting part of the conversation to bring up that very funny
2030560	2033560	albinies last week in New York.
2033560	2039560	I was sitting there, so I think there was a really uncomfortable kind of coincidence
2039560	2046560	that happened, which was that Rory was not looking at ... If you were listening to the
2046560	2049560	podcast, Rory is not looking at Jane, I don't think.
2049560	2053560	I don't think he knows Jane exists or where Jane is.
2053560	2058560	Rory is hearing about Jane verbally.
2059560	2067560	And then there's a point where Rory, as a stand-up comic coming from a certain 90% of
2067560	2073560	the time admirable instinct for skepticism of social trend and fad and groupthink and
2073560	2081560	things, still got the name wrong, Jan or Jane or something, wasn't looking at Jane,
2081560	2087560	but then went into a kind of riff about, and I know it's okay to have boobs these days
2087560	2090560	and do whatever you want or the transgender thing.
2090560	2097560	And I was like, oh, God, this is terrible because Jane is a harmontown fan.
2097560	2100560	That's what happened.
2100560	2102560	It was just sort of a bumper car crash.
2102560	2109560	I thought it was good to let the traffic keep moving rather than stop down the entire show.
2109560	2114560	I knew that Jane would probably most likely be tickled by the whole thing.
2114560	2117560	And I have no idea if anything happened online as a result of that.
2117560	2120560	We're living in tender times.
2120560	2125560	But I did see a tweet or two that implied that maybe, I don't know, conversation got
2125560	2132560	generated about that moment because it's like a really important bottleneck that we're
2132560	2134560	going through all at the same time.
2134560	2137560	And so there's conversation generated on there.
2137560	2140560	For my part, I don't know any more information.
2140560	2147560	I just wanted to say I was sitting there on the stool and no one was witness to a microaggression.
2147560	2150560	I almost feel dumb like being a traffic cop for that.
2150560	2157560	But I'm always like the most bummed out about people hurting each other's feelings
2157560	2160560	because I know that nobody wants to.
2160560	2162560	There's so few people that would ever make that choice.
2162560	2165560	By the way, here's a trick.
2165560	2170560	If somebody is saying something hurtful to you, it's either a misunderstanding
2170560	2179560	or they're putting so much energy into trying to hurt you that they must be anticipating the same from you.
2179560	2182560	There's no other reason why they would do that.
2182560	2188560	And they're always drawing that energy from some other part of them that's a great place
2188560	2192560	for a sneak attack, which is their respect receptor.
2192560	2197560	If somebody is being a total piece of shit to you, there's almost nothing to lose
2197560	2201560	by even giving that first shot, which is just being nice.
2201560	2203560	Which, by the way, Jane always does.
2203560	2207560	Jane always meets that stuff with total resilience and compassion,
2207560	2213560	which makes you wobble and goes like, oh, I thought this whole thing was about making me feel bad.
2213560	2222560	So anyways, I got high before the show.
2222560	2226560	I don't know who any of these people are.
2226560	2232560	Only heard the episodes I've actually been on, so it's two.
2232560	2236560	You can reference those episodes. I'll know what you're talking about.
2236560	2241560	Didn't he say he played a lot of Gwent, that guy, Rory?
2242560	2251560	Yeah, Rory, who's awesome, by the way, was doing this IFC pilot with us, a really, really, really cool guy.
2251560	2258560	Yeah, he said he stopped playing the game, I think, because he was just playing Gwent with NPCs.
2258560	2261560	Well, if you overheard that, then it was him for sure, yeah.
2261560	2267560	Yeah, he plays for the Gwent, for you Witcher 3 fans, that's some Witcher 3 comedy for you.
2267560	2268560	He plays for the Gwent.
2268560	2271560	Holy shit, we're going to bring our guests up. Jesus Christ. What the fuck?
2271560	2273560	I was just going to say something.
2273560	2275560	What the fuck? What were you going to say, Ryan Ridley?
2275560	2279560	I was going to say, let's keep the show moving, because that's what a comptroller is supposed to do, right?
2279560	2283560	In what way should we keep the show moving, comptroller Ridley?
2283560	2285560	Let's bring up our guests.
2285560	2286560	Oh, shit.
2286560	2289560	Dan, introduce our guests.
2289560	2291560	Sorry, I was reading texts from Aaron.
2291560	2293560	Excellent comptroller.
2293560	2296560	Thank you.
2297560	2302560	We'll bring our guests up, and then we'll read them police brutality statistics.
2302560	2305560	Okay, now I've got to go back to the – hold on.
2305560	2311560	Dan was saying, in the last four days, 500 people have been killed by cops.
2311560	2314560	It's funny, because it's not true.
2314560	2317560	Yeah, I got it a little wrong.
2317560	2319560	All right, Jesus Christ.
2319560	2325560	Could someone put kerosene on my face and light it on fire?
2325560	2330560	To just burn off some of the sweat?
2330560	2331560	Or is there a towel?
2331560	2333560	I'm fucking dying up here.
2333560	2339560	I'm like Louis Armstrong.
2339560	2341560	But I haven't earned it.
2341560	2347560	I mean, he's like blowing into a tube.
2347560	2353560	So these guys are recent addition – recent relative to us, we're old timers – recent addition to the Feral Audio Network.
2353560	2358560	They had this show that they started doing called Before You Were Funny, which is a really interesting concept.
2358560	2360560	We live in Los Angeles.
2360560	2367560	We're surrounded by geniuses all the time and people we admire, even ourselves sometimes.
2367560	2373560	And then you really – you open up to yourself and your closest friends about the really hack shit you did,
2373560	2380560	unless you're some kind of weird, deformed prodigy that was like writing good comedy when you were 13 years old.
2380560	2382560	You probably went through this horrible hack phase.
2382560	2384560	So it's a really refreshing show.
2384560	2385560	I took part in it.
2385560	2386560	Aaron's done it.
2386560	2392560	It's really great when you get the right group of people, these really funny people that come together
2392560	2399560	and reveal that when they were 22, 25, 27, whatever it is, that they wrote these horrible and funny things
2399560	2401560	and they read through them.
2401560	2403560	It's an uplifting experience.
2403560	2404560	It's not caustic.
2404560	2408560	I wouldn't tolerate it otherwise.
2408560	2415560	Did you hear my 38-minute, what is your point, transgender monologue?
2415560	2427560	I obviously care about something that has clearly to do with me being perceived as a good person
2427560	2432560	and stops completely right there and does no one else any good.
2432560	2435560	I just have this really tight bubble around me of good intention.
2435560	2437560	Yeah, you don't have to try so hard, man. You are a good person.
2437560	2442560	If anyone ever finds himself looking over here into this corner of the room,
2442560	2445560	just wanted you to notice I'm a feminist.
2452560	2453560	Hello?
2454560	2456560	Boy, oh boy, is that bad.
2456560	2457560	What do we do to black people?
2457560	2458560	Hello?
2460560	2461560	Just over here.
2461560	2467560	I brought some calamari frozen.
2467560	2468560	I don't know how to make it.
2468560	2469560	I'm white.
2471560	2473560	I'm so white.
2480560	2482560	When's the bachelor coming on?
2484560	2485560	Okay.
2485560	2487560	I had to give him a place.
2487560	2488560	It was for my improv training.
2488560	2491560	I put him at a bachelor viewing party.
2493560	2495560	So these guys have the show.
2495560	2496560	It's called Before You Were Funny.
2496560	2501560	Let's meet them and pick their brains about this weird verdun that they live in.
2501560	2503560	Justin Michael and Jacob Reed.
2515560	2516560	Hello, fellas.
2516560	2517560	Hello, how are you?
2517560	2518560	Sorry about the wait.
2519560	2520560	Wait was great.
2520560	2522560	We learned about a lot of social issues.
2522560	2523560	Okay, good.
2524560	2528560	Are you guys airtight now on how to feel about me?
2528560	2529560	Yeah.
2529560	2531560	I'm a good person.
2533560	2536560	I don't know how to tell you how to feel about gun control,
2536560	2538560	global warming, transgender.
2541560	2545560	We need a noun that describes the issue because I keep going.
2545560	2547560	Transgender movement.
2548560	2549560	Yeah.
2549560	2551560	Transgender issue.
2551560	2552560	Transgenderism.
2552560	2553560	Transgender.
2553560	2554560	Yep.
2554560	2555560	Yeah, I'll text that.
2555560	2556560	I don't know.
2556560	2557560	That makes it sound like that.
2557560	2558560	That's all right.
2558560	2559560	What if we just refer to it?
2559560	2560560	LGBT rights.
2562560	2565560	I looked to you like you were saying that and that was not you.
2565560	2569560	I'm not going to memorize a bunch of letters that don't spell something.
2569560	2571560	ISIS I can remember.
2572560	2574560	LGBT.
2575560	2579560	I don't know whether to respect it or order it.
2580560	2586560	So if those, if that acronym had vowels in it and made a word,
2586560	2587560	then it would be better.
2587560	2588560	Yeah.
2589560	2593560	And it would have to spell something cool, like tree or something.
2594560	2595560	Sword.
2596560	2598560	I bet if you rearranged them enough, it would spell something.
2598560	2600560	I mean, it spells quipital.
2600560	2601560	Quipital.
2602560	2603560	Yeah.
2603560	2604560	The thing that you slice somebody with?
2604560	2605560	Yeah.
2605560	2607560	I took quipital for a week when I would have the flu.
2608560	2614560	So if you guys, how long have you been doing this experiment of inviting
2614560	2619560	people to bring their, really the shit that they would never want anyone to
2619560	2622560	hear if they were invested in protecting their image?
2623560	2629560	Three years as like a good show and then like six years probably.
2629560	2635560	Did it six years ago, like twice and then stopped because there was zero
2635560	2637560	audience for the first year.
2637560	2638560	Yeah.
2638560	2639560	And then we tabled.
2639560	2642560	They were like, we should wait until we, until more of our friends become
2642560	2643560	famous and want to do this show.
2643560	2644560	Right.
2646560	2647560	And also, yeah.
2647560	2653560	The thing I'm curious about in, in that time, so I'm trying to, I'm trying to
2653560	2657560	be a better interviewer, but so part of it was me realizing that you're not
2658560	2660560	supposed to ask things that you think an interviewer should ask.
2660560	2662560	You're supposed to ask things that you actually want to know.
2662560	2664560	So I was thinking about what I want to know.
2664560	2668560	And the thing is, when you hear it, it's not going to be that you're going to
2668560	2669560	be like, we can't answer that.
2670560	2677560	But what I really want to know is like, when you're like, who, there's must be,
2677560	2685560	you now have, you guys have, you guys have an encyclopedic library of diff, of
2685560	2688560	the ways people handle embarrassing themselves.
2688560	2689560	Oh, yeah.
2689560	2690560	Yeah.
2690560	2693560	So you must, do you have a shorthand for, oh, he's a Henry.
2693560	2697560	Like, like, he's gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna bring in the shit that he
2697560	2699560	actually thinks is funny.
2699560	2700560	And you're going to be able to tell.
2700560	2701560	He thinks it's funny.
2701560	2703560	There are some people who do bring in things that they think is funny.
2703560	2705560	And then, you know, but, and then they're like, oh, it didn't go over well
2705560	2707560	because people are expecting bad things.
2707560	2708560	Right.
2708560	2710560	I think it's a defense mechanism because you're like, wow, I said,
2710560	2712560	bring your most terrible stuff, but I'll bring my stuff.
2712560	2713560	It's still a show.
2714560	2715560	Which is the word.
2715560	2719560	I mean, it's such an understandable, logical decision, but it's so, you can
2719560	2723560	see how that's, I think, isn't that, isn't that what we're all doing all the
2723560	2724560	time?
2724560	2731560	Aren't we all going, uh, well, you know, they say you love me, but you know,
2731560	2736560	like you, I guess that is, uh, you'd love me more if I was a little different.
2736560	2739560	And we don't, we don't, we're not ourselves.
2739560	2741560	Therefore we know our warts are not showing.
2741560	2745560	Therefore our, our actual like most amazing moments are kind of through a
2745560	2746560	weird gauze.
2746560	2751560	The best stuff is always this stuff that people are horrified when they realize
2751560	2752560	how bad it is.
2752560	2755560	Like a lot of the time people will, will send us stuff without having read it
2755560	2757560	ahead of time, which is what we suggest.
2757560	2760560	But I mean, I would read stuff before I send it to someone.
2760560	2764560	I think it'd be crazy not to, but a lot of people do what we ask and send it
2764560	2765560	sight unseen.
2765560	2769560	And then as they're reading it, they realize how truly terrible it is.
2769560	2771560	And those are the best reactions in the world.
2771560	2772560	Yeah.
2772560	2776560	We had one that, uh, they realized halfway through the sketch that only the
2776560	2778560	stage direction was racist.
2778560	2784560	The sketch itself was not, but the way in which they described it was very
2784560	2788560	racist, specifically mentioning the ethnicity of characters who are coming in,
2788560	2790560	but it didn't play into the sketch.
2790560	2795560	Well, that one, when you say it that way, that's as racist as three years ago
2795560	2797560	in network TV, like that.
2797560	2801560	Uh, but, but I thought, I thought you met like, like, like it would say, like,
2801560	2805560	like, uh, do mortgage and the boys are hanging out.
2805560	2808560	Like, I mean, there is stuff like that for sure.
2808560	2809560	Yeah.
2809560	2811560	Do more just regular on the show.
2811560	2815560	And he hasn't, he had a story about a commercial that matches that definition.
2815560	2817560	The, the descriptions were racist.
2817560	2822560	They were saying that the guy, they were spelling it wrong because they were,
2823560	2827560	I'm assuming cause a group of black people, like there's some of the vowels come
2827560	2830560	out and stuff because the, just in the state, in the stage direction.
2830560	2833560	Uh, anyways, the I'm a good person.
2836560	2838560	And if I had been at that audition, I would have pulled the mortgage out of
2838560	2840560	there. I was like, you're better than this.
2840560	2851560	Um, what is it about us at like, at that eight, because I, I brought in something
2851560	2853560	to your show that it's like, whatever.
2853560	2857560	I, it was something from when I was like 12 or 13 or something.
2857560	2861560	No, very early heat vision.
2861560	2865560	And we just, we just screened it and everyone enjoyed it.
2865560	2866560	And then we called the show.
2866560	2869560	But I think you guys recommend don't bring stuff in from your childhood because
2869560	2873560	then it's like, you know, the line between like, oh, how adorably bad at
2873560	2875560	writing I was at 12.
2875560	2880560	But like the really important thing is this idea that, that, that, that you
2880560	2884560	know, I don't know what age we think it is in our heads, but like, oh my God,
2884560	2888560	you're going to read that thing I wrote when I was 23.
2888560	2890560	Um, I think it's college.
2890560	2891560	Uh, yeah.
2891560	2894560	I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's that age between, and I don't know what's
2894560	2897560	supposed to happen to you in that age, except for you writing badly.
2897560	2900560	That's supposed to make you so good on the other side.
2900560	2905560	Do you, do we worship the idea of, uh, are we supposed to be perfect?
2905560	2906560	That's how it feels sometimes.
2906560	2909560	Like we're supposed to, we're supposed to never have done anything wrong,
2909560	2912560	which is very, it doesn't make any logical sense when you think about it,
2912560	2914560	but it is how we feel, right?
2914560	2917560	You're never supposed to have done anything wrong.
2917560	2918560	Yeah.
2918560	2923560	I think, I mean, I think what, for me, what I, uh, please keep, turn your
2923560	2925560	phone on.
2925560	2926560	Vibrate.
2926560	2927560	We have people.
2929560	2935560	I think, uh, yeah, what, what is fun about it for me is getting to see people
2935560	2940560	who I admire, who I'm friends with and, and realize that we were all and
2940560	2944560	sometimes still are just like terrible at what we all love doing.
2944560	2949560	And even, even great people will bring in stuff that's like maybe a year old
2949560	2951560	that just wasn't good.
2951560	2953560	They're just throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.
2953560	2955560	But I think it's like, oh, they're trying, right?
2955560	2956560	Right.
2956560	2957560	Right.
2957560	2959560	And there's this idea that like, when you watch people you love, you're like,
2959560	2961560	oh, they must've been perfect the whole time.
2961560	2962560	Right.
2962560	2963560	And they're not.
2963560	2966560	I mean, do you think that, do you think that Salinger, like, I mean,
2966560	2969560	I haven't read catcher on the rise since they made me read a chapter.
2969560	2973560	And then I just fucking got the cliff notes, but like supposedly isn't this
2973560	2977560	really, I mean, that was his whole trip is that he dedicated his life to this idea
2977560	2982560	that like, and now his books are going to come out of a magic chest once a year,
2982560	2983560	whatever.
2983560	2984560	Everything was like batten down.
2984560	2987560	Like, like, no, look, there's no, there's no transparency there.
2987560	2991560	Who wants to, who wants to listen to Anne Rice disown the vampire movies?
2991560	2994560	Who wants to, I don't want to see what JK Rowling's having for breakfast.
2994560	2996560	This whole, everything's, who are these?
2996560	2999560	These people were creative and now they're just, now they're just boring,
2999560	3000560	terrible people.
3000560	3004560	JD Salinger, he wrote one book, one book, the most perfect book ever.
3004560	3010560	And then he did, and he boarded himself up in a basement.
3010560	3014560	But you could hear the typewriter clicking away.
3014560	3021560	And every once in a while they say the squirrel's breath carries a paper pulp on it.
3021560	3026560	But when they form, they say the New York Times is holding the last will.
3026560	3031560	The JD Salinger will once again have written the second perfect book.
3031560	3036560	Well, what if it, what if it was like better than, anyways, like how, like,
3036560	3039560	now I'm being rhetorical because I know we're all asking the same question.
3039560	3040560	Right.
3040560	3042560	But like, what, what the fuck?
3042560	3043560	What kind of person would that be?
3043560	3045560	Would we even like that person?
3045560	3047560	But we always think about the people that we admire.
3047560	3049560	We think that they're better than us.
3049560	3052560	We don't, we don't just think, oh, they must have fucked up really bad.
3052560	3056560	We have had a couple of people who bring stuff that's like, that they, they
3056560	3057560	truly think is terrible.
3057560	3060560	Like they're not trying to trick the show by bringing stuff they think is great.
3060560	3064560	But they are just so funny that even their terrible stuff is great.
3064560	3070560	And you kind of hate them for it because they just have been funny.
3070560	3072560	They're humiliated by an amazing sketch.
3072560	3073560	Right.
3073560	3078560	Or like we had a Rob Delaney did an early standup set that like almost verbatim
3078560	3082560	of, of how he would have done it back in the day, but then pointed out like it
3082560	3086560	was all very funny, but he pointed out with each joke, like why he doesn't think
3086560	3088560	it's funny now.
3089560	3091560	And it was more of just like, I wouldn't make that.
3091560	3094560	He was saying like, he wouldn't make that kind of joke now because that's just
3094560	3096560	not what his sense of humor is.
3096560	3100560	So sometimes it's, it's not as much about like, Oh, you were shitty then.
3100560	3103560	It's like, Oh, you've been funny the whole time, but your perspective has changed.
3103560	3104560	Right.
3105560	3108560	That's not a funny answer, but that's the truth.
3108560	3113560	I mean, maybe one day in the future you'll have the perfect funny funniest answer.
3113560	3115560	No, that's the answer I wanted.
3116560	3117560	No, it's not.
3117560	3118560	What am I talking about?
3119560	3120560	There was a random answer.
3120560	3121560	I don't want to.
3122560	3126560	There was a very interesting, like I, it's, it's because I wouldn't, Aaron did
3126560	3127560	the show.
3127560	3128560	Aaron's was amazing.
3128560	3129560	Yeah.
3129560	3130560	So like late bears.
3130560	3132560	She, she was, she was writing.
3132560	3136560	She was, she wasn't, there weren't letters to her English teacher.
3136560	3137560	They were like plays.
3137560	3140560	They were plays, but they were clearly like she was.
3140560	3142560	It was fan fiction for her own life.
3145560	3147560	And then only she had read before.
3147560	3148560	Right.
3148560	3149560	And yeah.
3149560	3150560	And then, yeah.
3150560	3156560	And like, it was a very transparent like attempt at a sort of seduction of this teacher.
3156560	3162560	I think, I think the plan was that she was going to, everyone in her class had to write
3162560	3167560	these plays, these like one act and hers involved a character loosely based on her and a character
3167560	3172560	loosely based on her teacher having a liaison after school.
3172560	3174560	But having kind of a snarky, like it was definitely not.
3174560	3178560	It was clearly, and this is the thing that would like make me cringe the most.
3178560	3183560	Like we were talking about these bare wires that I think your show at its best is like,
3183560	3187560	this was energy is coming from these exposed wires.
3187560	3194560	The most, to me, listening to those pieces she was reading, the craziest thing about
3194560	3200560	them was that she didn't, she didn't just want to have sex with her teacher.
3200560	3206560	Like she, the way she was, like she wanted to be married to him and she wanted to like,
3206560	3208560	she wanted to have sassafrasse with him.
3208560	3210560	Like she wanted, like, like, like, like it didn't have it.
3210560	3213560	I mean, it was like they were talking about sex, but it was more like, like,
3213560	3218560	it was like if a 16 year old, like what a 16 year old thinks that all of that stuff would be.
3218560	3219560	Yeah.
3219560	3220560	Like, like, like, yeah.
3220560	3223560	She wanted to have like this repartee and like, yeah.
3223560	3227560	And that was like crazier than if she had just said his hand touches her boobs.
3227560	3230560	Because also he'd be staying there after class the whole time.
3230560	3231560	Milk comes out.
3231560	3232560	Sorry.
3232560	3237560	I was just telling them what boobs do.
3237560	3238560	What did you say?
3238560	3241560	Oh, just the idea that a teacher stays there that long after class too is like,
3241560	3246560	he must be burning the midnight oil every night, an element or a middle school teacher.
3246560	3249560	Like he's not just flocking out and getting the fuck home.
3249560	3250560	Yeah, exactly.
3250560	3254560	But it is, it's exposed, I think that's, that's the thing.
3254560	3257560	It's like nobody, what is that?
3257560	3262560	Like, like, like it's when your intent is so clear, when it's like crystal clear.
3262560	3267560	I think the best stuff comes from the end of high school and the beginning of college,
3267560	3275560	because that's when you, you're at the center of the world to yourself more than the world's so big.
3275560	3276560	Right.
3276560	3278560	Like you just realize the world's bigger than it's ever been.
3278560	3279560	You're going to be a part of it.
3279560	3280560	You're right at the center.
3280560	3282560	And you don't know that you're wrong.
3282560	3288560	And everything that you do is something you're inventing because you haven't seen hardly anything.
3288560	3290560	You've had a chance to see four things.
3290560	3293560	So you're definitely not going to write where the red fern grows again,
3293560	3296560	but everything else you're convinced you're creating.
3296560	3300560	You're like, holy shit, man, I'm going to like, and it's so like,
3300560	3304560	like God forbid that you ever get that insulation.
3304560	3307560	I feel like your friends that go to film school, you know,
3307560	3309560	that was always the cliche when we first came out here to LA.
3309560	3312560	It was like, oh, he must have gone to film school because we just had an hour lunch with him.
3312560	3316560	And we talked about 20 movies and he never smiled.
3316560	3320560	And we talked about what kind of movie we want to make with our, you know,
3320560	3321560	camcorders.
3321560	3323560	And he, you know, he was paralyzed because I was like, oh,
3323560	3328560	he must have gone to film school because for four years you're sitting there watching everything
3328560	3332560	and learning what everybody's ever thought that ever picked up a camera.
3332560	3336560	And it fills you with like, oh, who's little old me?
3336560	3341560	Yeah, it's before you realize that I think when you become an adult,
3341560	3346560	which I am not claiming to be, but you realize like someone has done a good version
3346560	3348560	of a lot of different things already.
3348560	3352560	And it's crippling because what the fuck are you going to add?
3352560	3357560	But at the heart of that fear, though, it can't just possibly be because we're not
3357560	3360560	that noble that we would just think, well, I wouldn't want to be,
3360560	3368560	I wouldn't want to do a worse job of writing a book about a car that eats people than Stephen King.
3368560	3371560	It's, it's, there's a, there's a one thing right after that.
3371560	3373560	And that's actually what we're worried about.
3373560	3376560	It's the, then everyone will make fun of me.
3376560	3377560	Right.
3377560	3380560	Then everybody, it's not, it's not actually the book being bad.
3380560	3383560	It's like people will think that I'm stupid.
3383560	3387560	People will think that I think that I invented cars that eat people.
3387560	3390560	And then they'll be like, you know, you didn't invent that, right?
3390560	3392560	And I'll be like, fuck you, fuck you.
3392560	3395560	Like, I just, I'm not going to, no, no, no, no.
3395560	3399560	I'm not going to enter this game until I'm safely away from all the double dutch.
3399560	3403560	And like, I'm going to do this perfect Mary Lou Renton, this handspring through it.
3403560	3408560	What the, what in the fucking 42 year old man.
3408560	3414560	And then I'm going to land a Frogger game and just get the Pokemons.
3414560	3416560	We started in a car that eats people.
3416560	3417560	Yeah, yeah.
3417560	3421560	Christine, I'm holding that up as like, oh, I didn't want to get anything wrong about Anna Karenina.
3421560	3427560	The thing is, by the way, Stephen King himself has done multiple versions of the,
3427560	3429560	I'm going to one up the car that eats people.
3429560	3431560	It's a washing machine that eats people.
3431560	3432560	Yeah.
3432560	3434560	It's lots of trucks that eat people.
3434560	3436560	Like he's done his own.
3436560	3439560	Most of the people that you think are great, which is why I brought up Salinger,
3439560	3442560	because I think he's kind of one of the exceptions because we just can't, you know,
3442560	3445560	people want to find Salinger failing and it's like,
3445560	3446560	Oh, he wrote catcher on the Ryan.
3446560	3449560	He's the literary equivalent of the episode of Seinfeld,
3449560	3456560	where George decides to just leave after he gets one joke in in a meeting.
3456560	3460560	Everybody else that you admire, in fact, quite, you know,
3460560	3462560	like Stephen King is a great example.
3462560	3467560	As I'm sure now it's now it's kind of hip to kind of not say he's good at anything,
3467560	3470560	but certainly one of the most prolific, like, sorry, Stephen,
3470560	3473560	if you're listening or your son or anyone that loves you,
3473560	3478560	your caretakers, why am I, why do I do that?
3478560	3485560	Not that anyone thinks Stephen King's good.
3485560	3486560	Honey, what was it?
3486560	3488560	Do you think Dan has something against Stephen King?
3488560	3490560	I don't know.
3490560	3495560	But I think it's cool that you're driving, even though I'm a guy.
3495560	3496560	They got to get to that bathroom.
3496560	3497560	I'm a guy, too.
3497560	3501560	My voice is just in a higher register.
3502560	3507560	Why are you holding those ice cream cones and lifting them up and down?
3507560	3511560	I thought you might like one or the other.
3511560	3515560	Do you like vanilla or chocolate?
3515560	3517560	I don't feel very secure in this conversation,
3517560	3521560	so I don't know if I'm going to volunteer information about what I like,
3521560	3526560	but I'll tell you chocolate without letting you know whether that's what I am.
3526560	3527560	There is no chocolate.
3527560	3528560	Fuck you.
3528560	3530560	See, that doesn't hurt me because, as I was saying,
3530560	3533560	I don't have the power to hurt me, and I'd appreciate it if you just let me out up here.
3533560	3534560	Nope.
3534560	3535560	Fucking problem at all.
3535560	3538560	I'm moving these ice cream cones to the right.
3538560	3539560	Yeah.
3539560	3540560	Just word of advice.
3540560	3541560	I don't want your advice.
3541560	3542560	Word of advice, though, in case you don't know.
3542560	3543560	I don't want your fucking advice.
3543560	3544560	Close the fucking door.
3544560	3545560	Close the fucking door.
3545560	3546560	Word of advice.
3546560	3548560	Don't you fucking physically intimidate me.
3548560	3550560	Don't you physically intimidate me.
3550560	3551560	Oh, give me a fucking break.
3551560	3552560	Fuck you.
3552560	3553560	Fuck you.
3553560	3554560	Ah!
3554560	3555560	Ah!
3555560	3556560	Ah!
3556560	3557560	Whoo!
3558560	3559560	Freeze!
3561560	3562560	Freeze!
3566560	3567560	Freeze!
3567560	3569560	Put the towels down!
3573560	3574560	Give me the handcuffs.
3574560	3576560	Where are the extra handcuffs?
3576560	3578560	There's like four people here.
3578560	3581560	We don't have enough handcuffs for all these corpses.
3582560	3586560	Should we check in on the police brutality statistics?
3586560	3587560	Yes.
3588560	3592560	Okay, now these are coming in from Erin, who's our correspondent in Ireland.
3592560	3595560	I don't know why she knows this about the U.S.
3595560	3600560	And so I'm not saying these are accurate, so...
3600560	3602560	I feel like there's huge...
3602560	3606560	I want to put this big, giant asterisk on this and say,
3607560	3609560	if I haven't said this already, can you...
3609560	3613560	You have to believe one of two things, which is that all cops are bad.
3613560	3618560	If you don't believe that, and that's a crazy thing to believe because it's just a absolute thing
3618560	3622560	and none of those are true, then what has to be true is that there's good cops out there
3622560	3625560	and their hearts must be fucking broken right now.
3625560	3629560	And I know it's not a great time to be like, what about them?
3629560	3630560	But I just...
3630560	3631560	I do...
3631560	3634560	It's so easy to just be like, but they're a fucking epidemic.
3634560	3635560	Here's the numbers.
3636560	3638560	Well, here's the numbers from Erin.
3638560	3643560	If she's wrong, remember when that guy from Yahoo said we were one of 11 sitcoms to...
3645560	3646560	Oh, yeah.
3646560	3648560	And then people were like, what about Sanford and Sonnet?
3648560	3650560	It was like, okay, one of 238 sitcoms.
3657560	3663560	By March of 2015, U.S. cops had killed more civilians this year than they did in the U.K.
3663560	3665560	over the last hundred years.
3666560	3667560	Yeah.
3667560	3670560	So it's a hundred times more than Europe.
3670560	3671560	Yeah.
3671560	3673560	Every year.
3674560	3679560	U.S. cops kill at an average rate of 70 times higher than other countries.
3681560	3682560	Yeah.
3682560	3683560	Well, whatever.
3683560	3686560	And then there's some crazy shit that...
3686560	3688560	It's an epidemic and...
3688560	3692560	Dan, cops are like Stephen King books.
3693560	3695560	Most of them are very good.
3696560	3701560	But occasionally, he lets through The Mangler or...
3701560	3702560	Do you want to flip that?
3702560	3704560	I think there's a couple hits.
3704560	3708560	Like, there's a couple of good ones and then there's a lot of Tommy Knockers out there.
3708560	3709560	No, no, no.
3709560	3710560	Listen.
3711560	3713560	Only a couple of good Stephen King books?
3717560	3718560	It.
3718560	3719560	The Stand.
3719560	3721560	The Dark Tower Quadrilogy.
3722560	3724560	Plus two more or whatever.
3724560	3727560	Whatever seven books are in a series.
3727560	3730560	He was writing for, like, middle school kids.
3730560	3733560	It's all, like, eighth grade vocabulary.
3734560	3737560	I mean, that's the target audience.
3738560	3740560	Fuck you.
3744560	3746560	All right, well...
3747560	3754560	Do you guys have any parting words for people who are interested in...
3755560	3757560	Police brutality.
3759560	3762560	I mean, obviously people are going to look for your podcast.
3762560	3764560	It's called Before You Were Funny, which is...
3764560	3766560	Yeah, beforeyouwerefunny.com.
3766560	3769560	We're on Feral Audio, on iTunes, you know.
3769560	3771560	If you look up Before You Were Funny, you'll find it.
3771560	3772560	Yeah.
3772560	3774560	There's a lot of fun episodes with great people.
3774560	3775560	Your episode's great.
3775560	3776560	Aaron had an episode.
3776560	3777560	It's great.
3777560	3778560	I'm not going to say any episodes are bad.
3778560	3780560	They are mostly very, very entertaining.
3780560	3782560	But who is the worst person that you ever had?
3782560	3783560	Oh, that's easy.
3783560	3784560	No, I'm just kidding.
3784560	3785560	It's a great...
3785560	3787560	A lot of great people have been on the show.
3787560	3790560	And I'm certainly not going to publicly announce the ones that haven't been great.
3791560	3793560	We do have a thing.
3793560	3794560	Oh, yeah.
3794560	3795560	I don't know if...
3795560	3796560	I mean, there's probably not...
3796560	3797560	We'll just hand this to you blindly.
3797560	3801560	So this is something, when you did the show, that we didn't have time to read.
3801560	3802560	Oh, fuck you.
3802560	3803560	So...
3804560	3805560	Oh.
3805560	3806560	Oh, no.
3807560	3808560	Oh, no.
3809560	3813560	We haven't read it, so I truthfully don't know what it is.
3813560	3814560	Oh, no.
3814560	3815560	Thank you.
3816560	3818560	Feel free to say yes or no.
3818560	3819560	Wait, I don't even know...
3819560	3821560	Well, I'm just saying, oh, no, but...
3821560	3822560	I mean, we have to...
3822560	3825560	I mean, we're not going to do all that conversation, and then...
3826560	3827560	I'm getting that weird...
3827560	3830560	Like, I'm seeing this, and I'm recognizing...
3830560	3831560	I think I...
3831560	3833560	There's no date or anything on it.
3833560	3835560	This has got to be...
3835560	3840560	It's done on a regular typewriter, like a word processor typewriter, so it's got to
3840560	3841560	be like...
3841560	3842560	It's heavily indented.
3842560	3843560	Yes.
3843560	3844560	Yeah.
3844560	3845560	It's too heavily indented.
3845560	3849560	Like, I was learning to set margins while I was doing it, yeah.
3849560	3850560	Like, I'm going to...
3850560	3853560	I mean, I'm going to guess, like, I was like...
3853560	3862560	I could be anywhere from 15 to 19 writing this, but...
3862560	3863560	How do we read it?
3863560	3864560	I think it's a short story, so...
3864560	3865560	Yeah, we could go...
3865560	3866560	Paragraph?
3866560	3867560	Paragraph?
3867560	3868560	Round Robin?
3868560	3869560	We could...
3869560	3870560	Whatever.
3870560	3871560	All right.
3871560	3872560	Just the...
3873560	3874560	I'll do the...
3874560	3876560	Well, it doesn't seem like there's...
3876560	3880560	I see that there's a guy and a girl in this.
3881560	3890560	So, what if I did all the narrative and then one of you would be Dan and one of you would
3890560	3893560	be Ashley?
3893560	3896560	All right.
3902560	3903560	All right.
3903560	3908560	And the way that the podcast works is that anyone can chime in with questions or thoughts
3908560	3913560	about what's being read, so if you guys have questions or thoughts, or as you remember
3913560	3916560	maybe what this is from, you can tell us.
3916560	3918560	Well, don't tell them they can ask questions at each other.
3918560	3919560	Not the one.
3919560	3920560	Oh, you guys know.
3920560	3921560	You're everyone at a microphone.
3921560	3922560	Okay.
3922560	3924560	Sorry, no offense, guys.
3924560	3925560	You're...
3925560	3927560	But they're very empowered.
3927560	3928560	Sure.
3933560	3935560	You know, there's, like, a kid with a gun.
3935560	3939560	Like, that would be like an adult with a gun.
3941560	3942560	All right.
3943560	3945560	So, and my job...
3945560	3948560	Like, I'm a pussy if I don't just fucking commit to this.
3948560	3951560	Like, if I have to keep ruling my eyes and apologizing for it...
3951560	3952560	I think you have to go for it.
3952560	3953560	Like, that's...
3953560	3954560	I'm just talking to myself.
3954560	3955560	Like, I'm not gonna use...
3955560	3957560	Like, like, ooh, we get it.
3957560	3959560	You don't think you wrote good.
3959560	3960560	Whatever.
3960560	3961560	Like, okay.
3961560	3962560	Shut up.
3962560	3965560	This is, by the way, when you were asking about, are there certain kinds of guests,
3965560	3968560	this is what Sean Clements called the front porcher.
3968560	3970560	Oh, yeah, front...
3970560	3974560	Yeah, you're really front porched to the sketch, so you don't have to get to it ever.
3974560	3975560	Yep.
3975560	3976560	Okay.
3976560	3981560	Dan stood on the beach, his feet firmly planted in the sand.
3982560	3984560	He stared out at the ocean.
3984560	3988560	The sun was a fist-sized orange ball.
3989560	3992560	Nestled in...
3992560	3993560	This is long.
3993560	3997560	So, you can't see this, but we talked about indenting.
3997560	4001560	This first paragraph is so indented, you can't see some of the letters in the sentences.
4001560	4002560	I am, yeah.
4002560	4004560	I'm guessing at the word sand and soft.
4004560	4005560	Yes.
4006560	4012560	Fist-sized orange ball nestled in soft horizon-long clouds.
4012560	4014560	That's a long cloud.
4014560	4017560	Ah, it's the standard cloud length, also.
4018560	4020560	It's as long as they can be.
4023560	4028560	Seagulls were making calm passes in search, and then the paragraph ends.
4028560	4030560	So, I think this is me, like, stopping and starting.
4030560	4032560	This is, like, 80s style.
4032560	4033560	Oh, yeah.
4033560	4037560	Dan stood on the beach, his feet firmly planted in the sand.
4037560	4039560	He stared out at the ocean.
4039560	4044560	The sun was a fist-sized orange ball nestled in soft horizon-long clouds.
4044560	4047560	Seagulls were making calm passes in search of food,
4047560	4054560	and their rhythmic cries countered the ponderous, soothing bellow of the water stroking the shore.
4060560	4062560	You all know the sound of an ocean bellow.
4062560	4065560	Guys, thank you so much.
4065560	4069560	But, paragraph two...
4070560	4073560	The war was over.
4079560	4081560	I'm starting to get kind of proud of this.
4090560	4093560	The cities were leveled and empty.
4094560	4096560	The humans were dead.
4100560	4102560	All of them.
4102560	4104560	If it wasn't clear.
4106560	4113560	If they hadn't died in the war, they had plugged themselves into the Utopia Net
4115560	4118560	and uploaded their minds.
4123560	4127560	There was no way for them to come back, but they didn't want to.
4128560	4130560	All one word.
4130560	4132560	No one is all one word.
4133560	4142560	No one could resist the immortality and the omnipotence.
4142560	4149560	Not one person thought that having the whole planet to themselves was better than Utopia.
4149560	4153560	Utopia was forever, and it was anything you wanted it to be.
4153560	4156560	And yes, this predates The Matrix.
4158560	4160560	It was nothing.
4160560	4164560	Dan didn't want to hang around either, but he had to.
4164560	4167560	His mind was incompatible with the network.
4167560	4170560	I'm starting to do a sarcastic read.
4170560	4174560	Ashley surprised him from behind with a tall glass of milk.
4183560	4186560	Why didn't you guys come out with this on a flagpole?
4186560	4188560	Why didn't you save this?
4188560	4192560	By the way, we only have 30 seconds left, but we want to bring this really long story.
4192560	4196560	Ashley surprised him from behind with a tall glass of milk.
4196560	4198560	I thought you might be back here.
4198560	4202560	She said, listen, there's a lot of stuff I want to do.
4202560	4206560	Do you think Disneyland will work?
4206560	4209560	I mean, do the electric companies keep going and stuff?
4209560	4213560	We got to find all that out, and we're not getting any younger.
4214560	4218560	Her mind was also tragically non-uploadable.
4222560	4228560	So earlier, when we said that all of the people who were alive, no one was alive.
4228560	4230560	We met except for these two people.
4230560	4234560	Yeah, well, everyone that didn't die in the war plugged themselves into Utopia.
4234560	4247560	And I'm stuck getting to have sex for the first time in my life over a nice glass of milk.
4247560	4250560	What's the big deal?
4252560	4255560	I'm as old as 19.
4255560	4260560	Dan touched your cheek and smiled a genuine smile.
4261560	4265560	Pumpkin, we're the youngest people in the world.
4272560	4277560	Not really, honey. Not if life begins with conception.
4284560	4287560	Which it does, which it does.
4288560	4290560	If you find out later, it does.
4296560	4299560	I'm pretty sure I'm kind of pregnant.
4299560	4302560	This is before Joss Whedon.
4305560	4310560	Well, if you're not already, you're sure gonna be.
4317560	4336560	I figure it's unavoidable what with a drastic decrease in the prices of hotels and champagne,
4336560	4340560	due to everyone but us being dead.
4340560	4350560	Is that ironic? That seems like winking at itself almost.
4350560	4353560	She giggled.
4354560	4364560	A person dying was sad. Five people dying was horrible. Ten people dying would make you cry.
4365560	4373560	And seeing a hundred bite it might give you nightmares for the rest of your life.
4373560	4377560	I don't then walk you all the way up through the Holocaust.
4377560	4380560	Five million!
4382560	4386560	Five million, five hundred thousand! No!
4386560	4389560	The logic is that a hundred is once it becomes insane.
4389560	4392560	And then after that, a hundred and one, a hundred and two, six million.
4393560	4395560	Yes, exactly.
4395560	4398560	But South American invasions are only upsetting,
4398560	4405560	as is third world famine and the sinking of an American battleship.
4405560	4411560	And everyone on the planet being dead except for you and your boyfriend?
4411560	4414560	Hell, that's just fucking hilarious.
4414560	4418560	So they both laughed for about a minute.
4419560	4426560	Embraced, kissed, and made love there in the warm sand.
4433560	4437560	An hour later they were walking hand in hand.
4437560	4445560	I've got to make sure she's pregnant.
4450560	4456560	An hour later they were walking hand in hand through previously unsafe neighborhoods.
4456560	4458560	Topical.
4458560	4461560	They were on fire for the most part.
4461560	4464560	They were still unsafe.
4464560	4467560	Looters during the past few days had seen the end of the world
4467560	4471560	as a great opportunity to steal television sets and shoot each other.
4471560	4473560	No, that's television. Oh, sorry, sorry.
4473560	4477560	I thought you said television set, like singular.
4477560	4479560	It would have been a typo.
4479560	4481560	Yeah, nice one Spencer.
4481560	4482560	Hey, thanks Ryan.
4482560	4485560	That's right, you're waiting for when I was going to get him back, right?
4485560	4488560	I found my moment.
4488560	4492560	In the green room Ryan was saying that he was a mensch
4493560	4496560	for trying to get his friend in for free to the show.
4496560	4498560	Spencer, you dick.
4498560	4501560	That was not my friend. That was a stranger named Connor.
4501560	4503560	Where are you Connor? Do I know you?
4503560	4504560	That was a stranger.
4504560	4505560	Exactly. What happened?
4505560	4508560	I heard you say, I can't get in, I can't get in, I drove 45 minutes.
4508560	4512560	And I said, watch what this guy does.
4512560	4515560	And I went into the green room and I pulled some strings.
4515560	4517560	And now look at you, second row.
4517560	4519560	Well, I take that back, yeah.
4519560	4520560	Yeah.
4520560	4522560	You really are a mensch.
4522560	4523560	Yeah, thank you.
4523560	4524560	I thought that was a friend of you.
4524560	4525560	I'm a mensch.
4525560	4527560	Now, back to you, the utopia.
4527560	4529560	I don't think a mensch can call themselves that.
4529560	4530560	Do they?
4530560	4533560	No, Spencer, you don't point out that you're a mensch.
4533560	4535560	I don't think.
4535560	4537560	Back to you, Dan.
4537560	4539560	Yeah, I mean, I'm blank.
4539560	4542560	It was television sets.
4542560	4543560	Television sets.
4543560	4545560	Looters during the pebble didn't shoot each other.
4545560	4547560	That was funny too.
4548560	4551560	This was before Columbine.
4551560	4554560	Well, it was charismatic to not care as a 15-year-old.
4554560	4557560	And no one had done anything about it yet.
4557560	4560560	They found an undamaged Buick with the key in Buick,
4560560	4563560	like I know what a car is.
4563560	4566560	They found an undamaged Buick with the keys in the ignition
4566560	4568560	and drove it to Dan's home.
4568560	4570560	But it was completely burnt to the ground.
4570560	4571560	Son of a bitch.
4571560	4572560	Dan said.
4572560	4576560	I had $1,000 worth of computer equipment in there.
4577560	4587560	What did we make of that?
4587560	4589560	That was...
4589560	4590560	It's a ton of money.
4590560	4593560	Plus, also, if you're going to be uploading people to UtopiaNet,
4593560	4595560	you need computer equipment.
4595560	4596560	Yeah.
4596560	4598560	Ashley's place wasn't hurt at all.
4598560	4600560	I think that was my equivalent of going like,
4600560	4601560	I lost my skateboard.
4601560	4604560	You know, I thought that having that much computer equipment
4604560	4606560	made me cool.
4606560	4612560	Ashley's place wasn't hurt at all, so they spent an hour there.
4612560	4614560	Well, well, well.
4614560	4616560	And we know what takes an hour.
4616560	4619560	And there's no only one thing takes an hour.
4619560	4620560	Yeah, it's a pre-aid hold.
4620560	4625560	When there's only two people in the world.
4625560	4633560	Ashley cried and then laughed.
4633560	4635560	They took her parents' Pontiac Grand Am
4635560	4637560	because it had a CD player in it
4637560	4640560	and because my parents had a Pontiac Grand Am.
4640560	4642560	And they were already starting to miss
4642560	4646560	the constant barrage of broadcast information.
4646560	4649560	Page two.
4649560	4650560	Were you about to say,
4650560	4651560	we don't have to read the whole thing?
4651560	4654560	I just know you guys have stuff to get to.
4654560	4658560	Well, let's just go a little faster.
4658560	4659560	Oh, wait.
4659560	4660560	No, wait.
4660560	4661560	This is a different thing.
4661560	4662560	Really?
4662560	4663560	This is not...
4663560	4664560	What is this?
4664560	4665560	I like this.
4665560	4666560	What is this?
4666560	4667560	I mean, this is the file.
4667560	4668560	I don't know.
4668560	4669560	Yeah, this is...
4669560	4670560	I don't know what this is.
4670560	4672560	Let's pretend this is part of the same story.
4672560	4673560	Maybe...
4673560	4674560	Why don't we save this for next week?
4674560	4675560	Yeah.
4675560	4676560	Because this looks...
4676560	4679560	This looks a thousand times more embarrassing.
4679560	4686560	I didn't mean to say it.
4686560	4687560	What?
4687560	4689560	What are you saying?
4689560	4692560	We're gonna play Shadowrun.
4692560	4693560	Nah, man.
4693560	4694560	All right.
4694560	4695560	All right.
4695560	4696560	Fuck you guys.
4696560	4697560	All right.
4697560	4698560	We'll read it.
4698560	4699560	This is the thing.
4699560	4700560	But I'm telling you...
4700560	4701560	I can just tell...
4701560	4702560	I'm just wafting off of it.
4702560	4703560	I'm seeing random words and I'm going...
4703560	4704560	No, I know.
4704560	4705560	Because I think this is...
4705560	4706560	I don't even think this is a story.
4706560	4707560	I read ahead.
4707560	4708560	It's not as compelling.
4708560	4709560	I'm sorry.
4709560	4710560	Oh, really?
4710560	4711560	Yeah.
4711560	4712560	I think this is like free writing or something.
4712560	4713560	Yeah, this is not the same as...
4713560	4714560	How do we read this one?
4714560	4716560	Do we even know what to do with this?
4716560	4718560	Yeah, I don't know if there's characters or...
4718560	4724560	I'm thinking that by and large it looks like a dialogue between two people.
4724560	4728560	So if we try to go every other line...
4728560	4730560	I mean, do you guys just want to try it?
4730560	4731560	Yeah, let's do it.
4731560	4732560	You know what these are, John?
4732560	4733560	What?
4733560	4734560	Beautiful, man.
4734560	4735560	They're cool.
4735560	4736560	Seriously?
4736560	4737560	Don't lie to me about stuff like that.
4737560	4740560	I don't lie, John!
4740560	4745560	If I thought they were shitty photographs and your bed looked nice, I'd tell you your
4745560	4747560	bed looked nice.
4748560	4753560	As it turns out, though, your bed is a bare, cum-stained mattress, and your photographs
4753560	4754560	are great.
4754560	4758560	To be clear, that's B-A-R-E, not a bare, you know, animal shape.
4758560	4760560	No, that would be weird.
4760560	4761560	I don't know.
4761560	4765560	There's a world where it could happen.
4765560	4770560	A friend of mine told me that there's a place in Chicago that like discovers amateur photographers.
4770560	4772560	I got their number and stuff.
4772560	4776560	This friend of his or something made like a whole bunch of money through them, and he's
4776560	4778560	like fucking famous now.
4780560	4785560	Maybe that was like a mmm-hmm like a...
4785560	4789560	So, you think I could make money doing stuff like this?
4789560	4791560	What do you want money for?
4791560	4792560	And what is this?
4792560	4794560	No offense, but it's not real clear.
4794560	4796560	That looks weird.
4796560	4798560	Well, you know, why does anyone want money?
4798560	4800560	For food and stuff?
4800560	4802560	That's a picture of a soda cup in a theater.
4802560	4803560	I split it.
4803560	4804560	It's not real good.
4804560	4805560	Spilt it.
4805560	4806560	Sorry.
4806560	4808560	In fairness, that was spelled correctly.
4808560	4809560	You ever spilt it?
4809560	4810560	I spilt it.
4810560	4814560	It's not a real good photograph, but I wanted to remember it because I kind of got like
4814560	4816560	this big idea in my head when it happened.
4816560	4821560	This is before American Beauty.
4821560	4825560	It was one of those things like on TV when something happens to somebody or they see
4825560	4827560	something that kind of changes their life.
4827560	4830560	It says laugh in parentheses.
4830560	4831560	Well, what happened?
4831560	4832560	Wait, don't tell me.
4832560	4837560	You spilled your soda and your friends ridiculed you and got loud and someone in back said,
4837560	4838560	shut up to them.
4838560	4839560	And they said, shut up back.
4839560	4844560	And a fight broke out later and they blamed the entire thing on you.
4844560	4847560	No, nothing like that.
4847560	4850560	Really shut down that nameless friend.
4850560	4852560	Oh, well, that happened to me.
4852560	4853560	I guess so.
4853560	4857560	So no, I spilled my soda.
4857560	4858560	Right.
4858560	4861560	And I'm like pretty much in the middle of the theater and the floor slopes down.
4861560	4867560	You know, so the soda, big fucking soda, man.
4867560	4869560	This is probably after reservoir dogs.
4869560	4870560	I'm just assuming.
4870560	4871560	I don't know.
4871560	4872560	I can't tell.
4872560	4873560	Why is that in parentheses?
4873560	4875560	Is he speaking in print?
4875560	4878560	I think I didn't know how I didn't need to know.
4878560	4879560	You just do a dash.
4879560	4884560	I think this is before reservoir dogs and after I read something by David Mamet.
4884560	4886560	I'm trying to place this.
4886560	4887560	Oh, I see.
4887560	4889560	Yeah, it's big because like that's your foot, right?
4889560	4890560	Right.
4890560	4891560	Yeah.
4891560	4895560	So it's like bigger than my foot and there's a lot of soda and it flows downhill into everyone's
4895560	4897560	feet that's sitting in front of me.
4897560	4898560	Makes sense.
4898560	4902060	All the people in front of me start turning around and looking back like, who's spilling
4902060	4903560	shit on my feet, man?
4903560	4905280	And they're all looking at me.
4905280	4908200	So you know what you're going to, you know, what are you going to do?
4908200	4912240	You turn around.
4912240	4916280	I turn around and the guys behind me, they ain't got no soda on their feet, but they
4916280	4919240	do got 50 people turning around looking at them.
4919240	4925200	So they turn around because they're thinking, are they looking at something really neat
4925200	4926200	behind me?
4926200	4930760	And everybody's doing this and there's this loud mouth big guy that's everyone's afraid
4930760	4932160	about a quarter.
4932160	4936960	Everyone's afraid of presumably about a quarter away from the back and he starts up, what
4936960	4938360	the hell is going on?
4938360	4939360	What?
4939360	4940360	And all of a sudden the movie goes out.
4940360	4943880	Oh, that's not, I don't think that's dialogue anymore.
4943880	4944880	There was no end quote.
4944880	4945880	Right.
4945880	4947880	Excuse the fuck out of me.
4948520	4950000	And the movie goes out of focus.
4950000	4954960	See, I think a guy in the booth thing up there thought that everyone was turning around going,
4954960	4955960	what the hell?
4955960	4956960	Because it was out of focus.
4956960	4959360	So he tried focusing, but he fucked it all up.
4959360	4964320	So then everybody really does start yelling, all caps, focus, focus.
4964320	4977520	And so he eventually gets it back to normal before Plato's cave, Plato's Plato's cave
4977520	4979160	had not happened yet.
4979160	4980160	Okay.
4980160	4987720	Well, I'm really glad I didn't spend the whole interview going like, what's with these fucking
4987720	4990960	assholes that come up with this shit that's embarrassing?
4990960	4991960	What's wrong with them?
4991960	4996760	Because then it would have been like, you too.
4996760	4998640	It's amazing that you guys kept that stuff around.
4998640	5007360	Jacob and Justin, everybody from before you were funny.
5007360	5009560	It's the name of their show.
5009560	5012840	And when you listen to it, your spirit will grow.
5012840	5016040	It will grow from the pain that you feel inside.
5016040	5024240	Because when you were younger, your ego was wide.
5024240	5027080	Remember when you made that sound over there, buddy?
5027080	5035040	I had said something I thought was funny and you were like, this is how I laugh.
5035040	5041820	It sounds like you're making a shit sound with your mouth.
5041820	5045480	You're killing me.
5045480	5050240	Two different sounds for a reason, laughter, and then the poop sound.
5050240	5061280	It's like a boo, get your shit together.
5061280	5065160	Did you, when you were a kid, when you were younger, did you write a lot?
5065160	5066160	A little bit, yeah.
5066160	5068800	Did you get anything laying around?
5068800	5069800	Yeah.
5069800	5074160	I've got some archives.
5074160	5077680	To be honest, I'm at this level now.
5077680	5083680	Well, as we were kind of approaching with them, it's sort of a subjective thing because
5083680	5090360	I feel like the people in the audience, having been them and hearing other people be so laid
5090360	5100880	bare, for the person that's sharing the stuff, it's like, oh God, I don't know what the metaphor
5100880	5102880	is.
5102880	5108920	The actual cut is as deep and it's nice to learn that it's not that deep, but it's interesting
5108920	5114880	to see that the person that's receiving the cut thinks that it's going to cut their whole
5114880	5116280	arm off.
5116280	5121520	Then watching it not do that, because everyone's just like, how good a writer do you think
5121520	5125240	you are now?
5125240	5130200	How much do you think I care if you were ever a good writer and also isn't that the first
5130200	5133000	last honest thing you ever wrote in your life?
5133000	5136640	Because you were like, I tried to get you pregnant because you didn't know.
5136640	5138760	You're just honestly expressing something.
5138760	5142440	Was that part of some longer story, novella?
5142440	5147280	I was only, I wrote a thousand of those things.
5147280	5151720	I was trying to like, I was like, oh, I can see it.
5151720	5157640	I can see myself getting laid on a beach because the world ended because it's robots.
5157640	5159840	I want to know more about Utopia, Nat.
5159840	5161840	I want to know more about what happens to this couple.
5161840	5162840	Yeah, that's the trouble.
5162840	5164640	That's when you really have to write a story and stuff.
5164640	5168640	I was just more into the, you know, like when Michael Scott, when they find the posters
5168640	5170320	that he made for his movie.
5170680	5175680	Like it was one of those people, but I couldn't drop posters, you know, so I just wrote page
5175680	5186600	ones of a lot of like really, really immersive stories about me getting laid.
5186600	5190280	When I was really young, I would write sequels to movies, it was just like, I would watch
5190280	5191280	things.
5191280	5194920	Yeah, I'm a mensch.
5194920	5198080	I was in the middle of something where I would have said, bless you.
5198080	5203120	So really, you should have said, I'm sorry, because I was in the middle of something.
5203120	5204120	Bless you.
5204120	5206400	Thank you.
5206400	5207640	You're sorry.
5207640	5208640	It's okay.
5208640	5209640	Bless you.
5209640	5210640	All right.
5210640	5211640	What was that time?
5211640	5212640	Who cares?
5212640	5214400	I wrote a bunch of stuff when I was a kid.
5214400	5215400	Who cares?
5215400	5216400	All right.
5216400	5222200	I also used to, no, nevermind.
5222200	5242120	When I was first masturbating, I would go on, I was a kneeler, and there was no lock
5242120	5249520	on my bedroom door, so I just like at the height of my frenzy, I would just go into
5249520	5256720	my bedroom door, close the door, drop my pants, kneel, and jerk off right under the
5256720	5261320	door.
5261320	5266280	And much like Philip Seymour Hoffman's character and happiness, I would not like clean it up.
5266280	5274280	I would like, oh, wonderful, this is all part of the thing.
5274280	5278840	Because I thought, well, who would ever know what that is?
5278840	5281680	That's not going to be anyone's first guess.
5281680	5287640	Who would think a good person would come that much on a door?
5287640	5288640	What color was your door?
5288640	5290880	This is the perfect crime.
5290880	5292880	What color was your door?
5292880	5303520	After a while, yellow.
5303520	5307680	Let's move on.
5308680	5313560	That's the memory that came back to me when I was reading that, when the guy going, you're
5313560	5319400	going to get pregnant pretty soon if I know me.
5319400	5324120	That's all I was, was just this little useless jackhammer.
5324120	5326240	Did you have this in your hand while you were doing that?
5326240	5329560	I didn't jerk off to my own writing, Ridley.
5329560	5331320	Why not?
5331320	5337560	I did write stuff that I tried to cheat the system with the pornography.
5337560	5341320	Did you ever write porn for yourself?
5341320	5342320	Of course.
5342320	5344440	I drew it too.
5344440	5346080	I'm not ashamed.
5346080	5349120	Yeah, thank you.
5349120	5352560	All you non-wooers, loosen up.
5352560	5354680	Did you find that it worked?
5354680	5357680	Yeah.
5357680	5358680	Still does.
5358680	5362280	Wait, what do you mean still does?
5362280	5363280	What?
5363280	5370040	You don't write, you don't type out sexual scenarios and then masturbate to them.
5370040	5372320	You do.
5372320	5377800	If you do, then let me retract all of my funny faces because we want to know.
5377800	5381680	That would be a weird podcast, people reading the pornography that they write for themselves.
5381680	5382680	That would be fucking insane.
5382680	5384800	That would be the most extreme, right?
5384800	5389760	Especially if it was shipped from when you were 15, which is when I was really doing
5389760	5390760	it.
5390760	5391760	Man.
5391760	5393880	Oh, gravy.
5393880	5394880	What would that even have been?
5394880	5395880	I don't even know.
5395880	5399280	Does everyone remember how judgmental Dan was when I first brought it up and now he's
5399280	5400280	just confessing?
5400280	5402480	My floodgates are open.
5402480	5403480	Yeah.
5403480	5404480	All right.
5404480	5405480	Ridley.
5405480	5406480	Yeah.
5406480	5408600	Let's bring up Demorj.
5408600	5409600	All right.
5409600	5410600	For God's sake.
5410600	5417600	For God's sake, can we get Demorj up here?
5417600	5418600	Jesus.
5418600	5419600	Let's bring up Demorj.
5419600	5420600	I feel like I'm doing it.
5420600	5421600	Is that what you heard?
5421600	5422600	It was more laconic?
5422600	5433800	I felt like I was more like, let's bring up Demorj.
5433800	5440760	I was like grumpy, like I needed you the whole time, but I wasn't willing to admit it.
5440760	5442760	That's not what I said.
5442760	5449120	This isn't the right time of the show to do maintenance, but for next week and all
5449120	5455040	weeks thereafter, we got to get some kind of implement for the ice because when I want
5455040	5458840	to make people a drink, I got to want to touch their ice.
5458840	5459840	Tongs.
5459840	5460840	A claw.
5460840	5461840	Yeah.
5461840	5462840	Tongs.
5462840	5463840	An ice claw.
5463840	5464840	Tongs would be fine.
5464840	5465840	A scoop.
5465840	5466840	A large spoon.
5466840	5467840	And you know what?
5467840	5471320	We've never asked anything in this venue.
5471320	5476320	We let them sell their comic books out front and we do our little show back here and it's
5476320	5484560	always been, it's been a, it's been a detente, but if shit goes down, if there is, if there's
5484560	5488880	not some tongs here next week, I don't know what that, is that the Star Trek theme?
5488880	5490880	Sounds like a pat.
5490880	5498880	It's almost like a Confederate harmonica fireside sort of whimsy.
5498920	5506320	Chris McKenna had the theme from The Last Starfighter in his iPhone and he would start
5506320	5511440	playing it every time I, every time I went into a rant about something.
5511440	5515320	And then it was like this weird feedback loop where it was like, do you like me or hate
5515320	5518320	me?
5518320	5525320	A therapist told me to breathe.
5525320	5526320	Wusha.
5526320	5527320	Wusha.
5527400	5529400	What's, what was that?
5529400	5530400	Oh, it's just, yeah.
5530400	5531400	Oh, you just made it work.
5531400	5532400	Make up it what you will.
5532400	5534400	Okay.
5534400	5535400	Allow it into yourself.
5535400	5537880	It might've been, it might've been a small racist part of me that thought that maybe
5537880	5543960	that was a real word that you were teaching us and it might've been the most racist part
5543960	5545960	of my brain of all.
5545960	5546960	Wusha, what's that?
5546960	5547960	What's that?
5547960	5548960	What have we learned about ourselves?
5548960	5549960	What have we learned about ourselves?
5549960	5550960	Wusha.
5550960	5551960	You're like, uh, mouth noises?
5551960	5552960	Oh yes, I'm sorry.
5552960	5553960	Sorry.
5553960	5562360	Take the words into your mind, roll them around like savory pieces of meat.
5562360	5565440	Allow the flavors to tell you what they tell you about yourself.
5565440	5569400	Later on, do research.
5569400	5578120	It's that time of the show, hey, when we, uh, when we play Shadowrun, and it's that
5578120	5582560	time of the show when we, we haven't had a, we haven't had a lady up and it's only just
5583560	5584560	a coincidence.
5584560	5588760	So I'd like to ask if anyone wants to come up to the stage, but I won't be picking you
5588760	5595280	if you, if you have a, if you present as a male.
5595280	5596280	Rex.
5596280	5599760	I got, you said, you said I'll come up and you raised your hand first, but, but, but
5599760	5603440	or I actually, you were in my field of vision.
5603440	5604780	She's been up.
5604780	5605780	That clinches it.
5605780	5608160	You haven't, you haven't been up too, have you?
5608160	5610840	All right.
5610840	5611840	You're from where?
5612200	5613200	Oh, from Australia.
5613200	5614200	Okay.
5614200	5619280	You won't, you won't be our first Australian, but we, we, we love them.
5619280	5620280	We love them.
5620280	5621280	We don't love them all.
5621280	5622280	We don't know that.
5622280	5623280	There might be bad people from Australia.
5623280	5624280	Some of us are fond of you as well.
5624280	5626800	So I'm working on it.
5626800	5627800	What's your name?
5627800	5628800	I'm Melanie.
5628800	5629800	Hi, Melanie.
5629800	5630800	Hello.
5630800	5631800	This is the mortgage.
5631800	5632800	My name is Dan Harmon.
5632800	5638960	Uh, I got high before the show and that's Ryan Ridley and that's, that's the audience.
5638960	5641880	Because Anatoly puts his feet way out.
5641880	5642880	It's fine.
5642880	5643880	You don't have to tuck them in.
5643880	5644880	I'm disappointed.
5644880	5645880	There's no cat sweater.
5645880	5646880	Yeah.
5646880	5649840	Anatoly, did you hear your Russian friends are like, Oh, the polar ice caps are melting.
5649840	5656680	Let these, we can put our legs out on the globe and then each leg will suck in more
5656680	5659000	oil so we can make more ice cap melting.
5659000	5660000	Yeah.
5660000	5661000	You guys are crazy.
5661000	5667920	I told Dan about that vice segment at dinner tonight.
5668040	5669040	You guys got dinner?
5669040	5670040	You guys got dinner?
5670040	5671040	Yeah.
5671040	5672040	Oh.
5672040	5673040	Oh, man.
5673040	5679040	I kind of asked, I should have asked where Spencer was, didn't I?
5679040	5680040	Yeah.
5680040	5681040	Yeah.
5681040	5682040	I care.
5682040	5684640	Oh, man.
5684640	5688880	He asked me why you don't drive me to the, to the show and I said, cause I, cause it's
5688880	5692800	his, it's his time to make his D and D's.
5692800	5693800	It's true.
5693800	5697000	I make, yep.
5697000	5698680	He was not making any D and D's.
5698680	5699680	Oh no.
5699680	5702400	This D and D was made months ago.
5702400	5704120	All right.
5704120	5707360	Let's, so Melanie, have you, have you heard the show?
5707360	5708360	Have you heard?
5708360	5709360	Yes.
5709360	5711440	So you kind of, uh, is there a character you, you've always wanted to play?
5711440	5712440	We'll give you first choice.
5712440	5716680	Um, I'd like to play Dr. Friend if I could.
5716680	5717680	Okay.
5717680	5718680	All right.
5718680	5721280	I feel like he would go off well as an Australian.
5721280	5726640	We're going to find out.
5726640	5728640	That's called Washaun, what he just did.
5728640	5731360	I'm taking that back to Australia.
5731360	5732960	I'm going to introduce it to the people.
5732960	5733960	Wait, I don't care.
5733960	5735040	Well, can you guys figure it out?
5735040	5736040	It's top down.
5736040	5737040	Okay.
5737040	5738040	Well, you always get, okay.
5738040	5739040	That always happens.
5739040	5741040	The one that says bring the mortgage.
5741040	5742040	There we go.
5742040	5743040	All right.
5743040	5744040	And we're good with this.
5744040	5745040	This is the number of people we need.
5745040	5746040	Right?
5746040	5748040	So you're, you're, you're Jeff Davis's character.
5748040	5749040	Really?
5749040	5750280	You have no idea what you're doing, right?
5750280	5751640	You're playing Eve Libertine.
5751640	5753320	That's Jeff Davis's character.
5753320	5754680	I don't know where we are either.
5755680	5756680	There's no Aaron.
5756680	5758680	Aaron's not here.
5758680	5760680	Do we need a replacement for her?
5760680	5761680	No.
5761680	5765680	So we have an her face person.
5765680	5770680	I mean, anyone's a face person, if you believe.
5770680	5775680	All it takes is a face.
5775680	5777680	All right.
5777680	5782680	Well, you got to recap and then we'll, we'll just, let's just jump in and see how it goes.
5782680	5783680	Yeah.
5783680	5786680	So, um, so I, I made an email address.
5786680	5788680	It's, it's Harmon town run.
5788680	5793680	If you have a Harmon town shadow run recap, just send it to Harmon town run at Gmail.
5793680	5795680	That'll make it easier for everyone.
5795680	5800680	This one was brought to you by Eben Burgoon, who also wrote a different one that I said
5800680	5802680	he didn't do, but he did it.
5802680	5803680	Okay.
5803680	5810680	That's all taken care of last time on shadow run with one last drink and a decision.
5810680	5815680	The gang hopped into their Uber and set out to claim their reward from Johnson.
5815680	5821680	After some shrewd negotiations, the crew handed over the BTL chip research and yellow men
5821680	5823680	to the scheming corporate stooge.
5823680	5829680	They were all smiles as Johnson gave them the hefty attache case filled with the sweet,
5829680	5832680	sweet paper money of this digital age.
5832680	5838680	Those smiles quickly faded to horror as they watched their nefarious employer shoot out
5839680	5845680	the unarmed yellow men, his splattered blood now on their hands, pants, and faces.
5845680	5850680	The question of their ethics barely coming into question until the noise from the Johnson
5850680	5855680	driving away turned to the sound of muted beeps from their briefcase.
5855680	5858680	Will our shadow runners ever get that next drink?
5858680	5862680	Will they soon join Jesse yellow men in nano hell?
5862680	5867680	Is the meter still running on their Uber and do they take paper money?
5867680	5872680	We find out now on Harmon town shadow run time.
5876680	5881680	Well, uh, I'm thinking this is going to go.
5881680	5885680	The briefcase is beeping and start running.
5885680	5886680	We can't just throw it out a window.
5886680	5887680	This is your apartment.
5887680	5892680	I think we're in a, you're in a, you're in a parking lot fence sorta area, like a transpo
5892680	5894680	lot.
5894680	5898680	So I'm, I'm, I'm just running.
5898680	5901680	Can I not throw a physical barrier up around the suitcase?
5901680	5903680	You absolutely can do that.
5903680	5904680	I'm going to do that.
5904680	5906680	All right.
5906680	5909680	Well, I'll just say whilst we're running.
5909680	5911680	Well, you have to concentrate.
5911680	5913680	You can't do that while everyone else runs.
5913680	5916680	I'm going to nobly sacrifice myself possibly.
5916680	5917680	All right.
5917680	5919680	Nobly sacrificing yourself.
5919680	5927680	You throw up a force dome around the briefcase as it's beeping is muted by the sound or not
5927680	5929680	the sound by the barrier.
5929680	5930680	You can't hear it beeping.
5930680	5932680	It's just chilling.
5932680	5933680	It's just chilling.
5933680	5936680	I may have made a mistake.
5936680	5939680	We now can't hear it beeping.
5939680	5944680	So if it beeps faster as it counts, let's run.
5944680	5945680	No, I'm right.
5945680	5947680	I'm well, I've seen her doing this and I'm sorry.
5947680	5951680	So now I'm I'm I need to play off my shame and go like, oh, good.
5951680	5955680	Yeah, I was I was going to I was clearing everybody out.
5955680	5957680	So I think it's good what you're doing.
5957680	5958680	That's good.
5958680	5963680	We shouldn't be able to hear it beeping that the beeping comes through the explosion medium.
5963680	5967680	Well, we should maybe move away.
5967680	5976680	If you can back up while you're creating that barrier, I'll make sure the path behind you is clear.
5976680	5979680	Hold the guard, runs to Dr.
5979680	5981680	Friend, wraps an arm around Dr.
5981680	5982680	Friend, lifts Dr.
5982680	5987680	Friend up and runs away with the package using strength and agility.
5987680	5988680	The package?
5988680	5989680	The person.
5989680	5990680	Oh, the person.
5990680	5991680	Not the package.
5991680	5992680	Yeah.
5992680	5995680	You run away towards the ends of the transpo lot.
5995680	5997680	You don't see anything happen.
5997680	6002680	Now you're just far away from a force field dome.
6002680	6005680	You hear the sounds, the sounds of people moving.
6005680	6008680	Maybe some sort of crowd or march.
6008680	6009680	People are moving.
6009680	6012680	Footstep sounds coming from far off.
6012680	6016680	You realize you're not in the best area of town.
6016680	6024680	Using my ability to detect enemies, I'm trying to see if there is anything that sparks inside of me.
6024680	6034680	Using your detect enemy skill, your perception shifts and you can start to see the flickering souls of life around you in the transpo lot.
6034680	6041680	You can see the warm auras of your friends sparkling with vitality but also much dimmer flickers.
6041680	6043680	Many, many flickers.
6043680	6044680	Something.
6044680	6047680	Some entities have damaged souls.
6047680	6050680	Some sort of weird magical interference.
6050680	6054680	But there's lots of them and they're all surrounding you.
6054680	6063680	So those of us with weapons should probably find them close at hand and we should stick together and look to be prepared.
6064680	6066680	What are you looking at?
6066680	6067680	What are you talking about?
6067680	6073680	Well, I just have a feeling that things are going to go a bit Minnesota in a minute.
6075680	6077680	You hear hissing and moaning.
6077680	6079680	Is that Minnesota?
6079680	6082680	It certainly is in California, I'll tell you that month.
6087680	6089680	But I digress.
6090680	6095680	I mean, they kind of sound like zombies or something.
6095680	6097680	They kind of do.
6098680	6102680	Why are they flickering? Are they like hologram zombies?
6102680	6113680	His enemy sense has the ability to read people's auras but people who are unhealthy or maybe afflicted by various things might have flickering or damaged auras.
6113680	6116680	Alright, well just tell me where to shoot.
6117680	6124680	And is there any way that I can get location on this or is this just sort of on the periphery?
6124680	6128680	There's easily more than 30 individuals.
6128680	6131680	They're kind of all surrounding the general neighborhood.
6131680	6133680	It's like they're fanning out walking around.
6133680	6135680	It's as if something's roused them.
6135680	6141680	Why have lifted my ARRI's Alpha assault rifle with the left hand and on the right the combat axe?
6141680	6144680	You guys do the best you can do.
6145680	6147680	Find what weapon you have.
6147680	6150680	Do we have a place we can all meet in case we get separated?
6150680	6156680	Well, I can't physically hurt someone who hasn't hurt me first, so I'm sticking with you.
6157680	6159680	Okay.
6160680	6162680	You can carry me, right?
6163680	6165680	Smartlink, perhaps.
6165680	6173680	Could we smartlink to future Uber or whatever this vehicle is and possibly get some sort of egress from this situation?
6173680	6175680	You could hail an Uber.
6176680	6179680	Then this is what I have done.
6180680	6184680	So we're not going to hang around and check it out at all?
6184680	6189680	It's doing that thing where you can see all those cars, but no one's biting, you know?
6191680	6195680	I'm going to go up to the roof so that I can protect everybody.
6195680	6199680	You're in a fenced area, just like a parking lot.
6199680	6218680	All right, I'm going to go over the fence and then I'm going to seek higher ground like a brave cat at the Humane Society in a cage with one shelf at the top.
6219680	6222680	Just higher ground just makes me more comfortable.
6222680	6226680	I saw a guy get killed on the ground once.
6226680	6230680	And he kind of triggers me.
6231680	6233680	So I'm going to go up.
6233680	6238680	I could cover you from here, perhaps?
6238680	6241680	From what?
6241680	6246680	Just muzzle raised. I'm covering you in case some sort of action should happen.
6246680	6248680	You said you're going.
6248680	6251680	Well, I thought we were all going to go.
6251680	6253680	Oh, it's a team operation.
6253680	6255680	We're at retreating?
6255680	6258680	I thought you were just going on the roof to watch out for us.
6258680	6262680	I was going to go up the roof because I'm scared, OK?
6262680	6265680	Do you want us to follow you?
6265680	6270680	I don't think you can. I think I have to leave you behind and go up to a higher place where I don't die.
6270680	6276680	So the one who is so full of so much bluster with monologues and everything, do you have a monologue for insecurity?
6276680	6282680	I don't think there's time for it. I'm scared. I'm scared of things on the ground. It's my thing.
6282680	6284680	But the money's on the ground.
6284680	6287680	So, so via com link or whatever that is.
6287680	6289680	Sure.
6289680	6293680	What's the sitch? Do you see people? Do you see zombies? What's going on?
6293680	6296680	No, he said he saw flickering.
6296680	6298680	I haven't seen anything yet.
6298680	6299680	I see the darkness.
6299680	6301680	Tell us what you see. Look around.
6301680	6307680	What I see is my hands climbing over a chain link fence, getting out of the fence area.
6307680	6316680	And I'm asking if I also see you guys coming with me or if I have to make up a lie about what happened to you to my friends at the bar.
6316680	6318680	I'm in.
6318680	6321680	Might I try and is there some sort of distance?
6321680	6325680	Can I try to mind link with some of these darker souls?
6325680	6329680	You're not within range of any mind linkable entities.
6329680	6331680	As I suspected.
6331680	6336680	Well, two. There's two votes in that direction. So I would say that then Holy God will follow.
6337680	6339680	As will Dr. Friend.
6339680	6344680	Heading over the fence, you climb upon the roof of an old devastated gas station.
6344680	6346680	Told you there's a roof.
6348680	6353680	What you see is people milling about. They look all weird and screwed up.
6353680	6359680	They definitely have sorts of skin conditions as well as white skin.
6359680	6364680	Like white white, like pale albino style white.
6364680	6371680	You see their eyes are crusted over as if they are blinded and their hands are covered in gnarled claws.
6371680	6376680	As if they've been twisted by some sort of dark force or virus.
6376680	6383680	You recognize them to be ghouls. That is to say people who have been infected by the HMHVV virus.
6384680	6385680	Too soon.
6385680	6395680	They're milling about. They haven't noticed you, but something has brought them out of the woodwork.
6395680	6396680	They haven't noticed us?
6396680	6399680	No, no. They're just milling about blind style.
6399680	6400680	How many?
6400680	6401680	Lots.
6401680	6403680	Like ocean?
6403680	6405680	Nah, like 40.
6405680	6406680	40.
6409680	6411680	Have I encountered ghouls before?
6411680	6414680	Oh, yeah. I mean ghouls, they're everywhere.
6415680	6419680	Is it possible to use spell casting to sort of...
6419680	6425680	I feel like we should just fight them, right? I mean, this is dying up here. I mean, come on, let's do something. Come on, let's fight these ghouls.
6425680	6427680	That's just puberty talking.
6427680	6430680	Do we fight one or do we separate one and see if we can cue them?
6430680	6437680	We can easily run away. The only thing that's keeping us here is, do we want to fight 40 ghouls for a briefcase full of paper money?
6437680	6438680	That's ticking.
6438680	6439680	Right.
6439680	6440680	Beeping.
6440680	6442680	They've got HMHV, man.
6443680	6445680	How hard can they be to defeat?
6449680	6455680	I got all kinds of magic spells and stuff. I'm sure you guys got some weapons. Let's do this.
6455680	6459680	You and the doctor maybe take your shot.
6460680	6461680	Well, can I... Spencer?
6461680	6462680	Yeah.
6462680	6464680	This says can't physically hurt someone who hasn't hurt me first.
6464680	6465680	True.
6465680	6467680	Are they technically trying to hurt me?
6467680	6474680	Well, you haven't seen them try and hurt you, but, you know, your morals, they slacken from time to time, so...
6474680	6475680	All right.
6475680	6476680	Let's do this.
6476680	6477680	Well, what if they...
6477680	6478680	Thank you.
6478680	6482680	All right, fine. I'm with you, sister. Talking to Ridley.
6482680	6484680	Yeah. I'm Eve Libertine.
6485680	6495680	All right. Well, I guess for lack of anything better to do as the guy who can only shoot guns, I'll just run down and go, ah, and shoot my gun.
6497680	6499680	I'm sure you'll be right there to help me.
6499680	6508680	Absolutely. I have severe seafood addiction. A distinctive style. I'm sure that...
6511680	6515680	How do I kill things, Spencer? What do I do? Where am I looking here?
6515680	6517680	I mean, you have, like, some guns somewhere?
6517680	6519680	I shoot them.
6522680	6524680	All right. Where?
6524680	6525680	At the Ghouls.
6525680	6529680	Okay. And, Dan, you're just running. You're running down.
6529680	6532680	I'm going, ah!
6532680	6535680	I have both guns in my hand, and I'm just firing.
6535680	6536680	Okay.
6536680	6537680	Just firing in the crowd.
6537680	6538680	My gun also is firing the others as well.
6538680	6544680	And part of what I'm doing is sarcastic, because I'm tired of people saying I'm a coward.
6544680	6550680	But the truth is, I'm a tactician and a procrastinator.
6551680	6557680	But if this is bravery, ah!
6557680	6561680	So who's all doing stuff? I got you two. Anyone else doing anything?
6561680	6567680	Can I fire the artist's assault rifle? Just blanket the area.
6567680	6568680	Sure. Now we're talking.
6568680	6572680	And I have a ranged weapon. I'd like to shoot that as well.
6572680	6576680	Okay. So everyone's just shooting. All right.
6577680	6583680	Jim Nightblade leaps off the top of the gas station and launches himself into the fray,
6583680	6586680	firing while yelling semi-sarcastically,
6586680	6589680	Whoa! Look at me!
6590680	6595680	He pops two or three ghouls in their body parts,
6595680	6598680	as Eve Libertine also fires her weapons.
6598680	6599680	Oh, yeah.
6599680	6601680	At the ghouls, dropping.
6601680	6603680	Let me use some of this astral combat, too.
6604680	6606680	I see there's a four next to it.
6606680	6608680	Well, that's not a gun, though.
6608680	6609680	It's combat.
6612680	6619680	All right. Utilizing his astral combat, he realizes all the ghosts he could be attacking right now.
6623680	6628680	Oh, ha, ha, ha. I'll get to them later.
6628680	6631680	Ha, ha, ha.
6631680	6636680	Continuing to hail the enemy with their fiery bullets.
6636680	6638680	I don't know what the fuck.
6638680	6645680	Anyway, firing many automatic weapons, bullets plunge into the zombies, killing at least...
6647680	6649680	Killing seven of them.
6649680	6650680	No, see, that's good. That's good.
6650680	6655680	Three surround Jim Nightblade, but the rest seem to be scared and running away.
6655680	6656680	Did you say 30?
6656680	6659680	Three. Not too bad.
6660680	6661680	They lunge.
6661680	6662680	Nano whip.
6662680	6663680	Well, they're lunging.
6663680	6665680	Well, nano whip, they're lunging.
6670680	6671680	They lunge.
6672680	6675680	Yeah, no, you definitely dodge out of the way.
6675680	6680680	It seems that ghouls are not too dexterous.
6680680	6682680	Looks like you guys aren't too dexterous.
6687680	6694680	Might I recommend some calisthenics in the morning and, oh, not being a ghoul.
6701680	6703680	Ghoul burn.
6706680	6707680	Where'd you go?
6707680	6708680	Yeah, what happened?
6708680	6711680	Yeah, I mean, obviously, take a shit, right?
6711680	6713680	There's no other reason to leave.
6714680	6717680	It's very subtle. Very subtle.
6718680	6729680	Hordegard, with his combat sense, expertly drops a few zombies, but then he sees Jim Nightblade being surrounded by ghouls.
6729680	6731680	I called in the airstrike.
6734680	6739680	Hordegard, you got crazy reflexes, so you're the only one who can act right now.
6740680	6742680	You make a poo-poo.
6750680	6753680	So, obviously, your skills are focused on the negative, right?
6755680	6757680	I guess it could have been a pee-pee.
6757680	6758680	No.
6759680	6761680	It was the latter.
6762680	6763680	That was fast, then.
6764680	6765680	You didn't...
6766680	6768680	We'll talk about it later.
6770680	6772680	Soylent blue is not what it used to be.
6778680	6779680	Save him, Hordegard.
6779680	6780680	From zombies.
6787680	6788680	Jesus Christ.
6789680	6791680	Blades. I'm tossing blades.
6792680	6793680	Okay.
6793680	6795680	What blades do you have to toss?
6796680	6799680	What sort of blades?
6800680	6803680	I think the combat hatchet's the only blade you have.
6804680	6807680	Actually, I'm not going to toss. I'm going to wield it.
6807680	6813680	I'm going to walk into the situation, moving as fast as I can, reacting quickly, and swinging.
6814680	6815680	Wait, what?
6816680	6819680	Murderous intent with anything that is a problem.
6820680	6822680	Walking quickly with murders intent!
6823680	6826680	You wield your axe wildly.
6826680	6829680	You leap off the gas station roof.
6829680	6831680	You land on top of a zombie.
6831680	6833680	Coming down with your hatchet.
6833680	6835680	You cleave the other one in half.
6835680	6838680	In twain, is it like what I used to call it?
6838680	6839680	Right in twain.
6840680	6844680	Cleft in twain was a really old D&D thing we did once.
6845680	6846680	Yeah.
6846680	6847680	Episode 8.
6847680	6848680	It's something like that.
6848680	6849680	Those were the days.
6850680	6852680	One zombie remains.
6853680	6854680	Really?
6854680	6855680	Really?
6855680	6858680	A lot of them scare us. He just killed two.
6858680	6860680	Now we're the bad guys. We're just going to gather around him.
6862680	6864680	Where are you going, zombie?
6864680	6866680	It's Saturday night!
6870680	6874680	We just start taunting it and waiting for a zombie cop to show up.
6874680	6878680	Is it possible that holding on could fire off a flashback?
6879680	6880680	Yep.
6880680	6881680	Flashbang.
6881680	6882680	Sure.
6882680	6884680	To possibly stop the zombie in his tracks.
6884680	6885680	Well, it's blind.
6886680	6887680	But a concussion.
6887680	6888680	Sure.
6888680	6889680	Might do a thing.
6890680	6892680	Do we need to question this zombie?
6892680	6893680	Sorry, before we kill it.
6893680	6894680	Yeah, yeah.
6894680	6895680	Find out what it knows.
6897680	6899680	I know I'm the overzealous one.
6899680	6901680	Everybody stand down.
6901680	6903680	Eve's going to question the zombie.
6903680	6904680	The ghoul.
6904680	6905680	Alright.
6905680	6906680	Get in there.
6906680	6908680	I mean, I can heal things.
6908680	6909680	He's what I'm saying.
6909680	6914680	Well, if he doesn't talk or she, then we don't heal.
6914680	6917680	We'll say, tell us the truth and she'll heal you.
6917680	6918680	Right.
6918680	6919680	Alright.
6919680	6920680	You get what I'm saying.
6920680	6923680	You guys got your fingers in the pulse of the ghoul population.
6925680	6929680	What I'm doing is I'm pushing my thumb into the ghoul's wound.
6929680	6932680	Trying to, you know, get it to talk.
6932680	6934680	You want to make physical contact with an infected beast.
6934680	6936680	It's a good way to get H.H.M.V.V.V.
6939680	6940680	Well, just, okay.
6940680	6941680	Ghoul.
6941680	6942680	Come on, ghoul.
6943680	6950680	Tell them what you know about wandering the streets of the future and trying to eat people.
6950680	6951680	Why are you here?
6951680	6952680	It's not Austin Powers.
6952680	6954680	There's no ghoul, captain.
6956680	6958680	They just came out of a place.
6958680	6959680	They didn't come out of the suitcase.
6959680	6960680	There's no...
6960680	6961680	We can't reason with them at all.
6961680	6962680	Yeah.
6962680	6963680	Why are you assuming all this?
6963680	6965680	Even if we could, is what I'm saying.
6965680	6967680	What if they were the smartest rats in the world?
6967680	6968680	What are you doing, rat?
6968680	6969680	He'd be like, what do you think?
6969680	6971680	I'm walking around in shit.
6972680	6974680	You're here in my story.
6974680	6975680	It's not...
6975680	6976680	I'm interrogating you.
6976680	6979680	The ghoul should be asking us, where can I eat you?
6981680	6983680	He has no information for us.
6983680	6985680	He's a mouth with legs.
6986680	6989680	This is some kind of crazy cyber steampunk world.
6989680	6991680	I don't know what the rules are.
6991680	6993680	It's half magic, half technology.
6993680	6995680	I don't know what ghouls are in this world.
6995680	6997680	I have some facility with spell casting.
6997680	7000680	Is there some sort of spell?
7000680	7001680	I'm searching my brain.
7001680	7004680	I'm trying to pull out something that might...
7006680	7011680	latch onto that kernel of human that might still be left within the zombies.
7011680	7012680	Consciousness.
7012680	7014680	I mean, I don't know, man.
7014680	7015680	You gotta check your spells.
7015680	7016680	I have...
7016680	7017680	The level is five.
7017680	7018680	I don't...
7018680	7019680	I'm looking at...
7019680	7022680	I'm gonna go over to the briefcase while this is happening.
7022680	7023680	Okay.
7023680	7024680	Is it still...
7024680	7025680	So while Spencer is laughing...
7025680	7027680	Does it still have the barricade on it?
7027680	7028680	Yeah, yeah, it does.
7028680	7032680	I go, hey, you wanna lower the barricade up?
7032680	7035680	This encounter's made me...
7036680	7037680	antsy.
7037680	7038680	Sure.
7038680	7040680	I'll lower the barricade.
7040680	7041680	You do that.
7041680	7042680	You hear beeping.
7043680	7045680	I open the briefcase.
7045680	7048680	You see nothing inside except for a small transceiver.
7048680	7050680	Fucking cock dick!
7050680	7051680	Admitting beeping.
7051680	7052680	Shit, fucker.
7053680	7057680	The ghoul that Ridley was talking to starts going crazy and crazed.
7057680	7061680	It starts thrashing around, trying to swipe at anything within reach.
7061680	7064680	But they put a fucking ghoul magnet in the goddamn...
7064680	7066680	God, gold is tricking the fucking...
7067680	7069680	Fucking ghoul magnet!
7071680	7075680	We fell for the goddamn three-card money of 2057.
7076680	7078680	The fucking ghoul magnet!
7079680	7081680	It's like, it's like...
7082680	7084680	What are we, fucking idiots?
7084680	7086680	Ghoul magnet!
7088680	7090680	So, are you stomping on it or anything?
7090680	7092680	Or do you want me to put the barrier back up again?
7092680	7093680	Oh, just, I mean, no.
7093680	7095680	Take the ghoul magnet.
7095680	7097680	We could sell it at a fair.
7097680	7098680	Can we turn it off?
7098680	7099680	What?
7099680	7100680	Can we turn it off?
7100680	7101680	What?
7101680	7104680	I mean, can you turn it off, really, by killing the ghoul?
7104680	7106680	The ghoul magnet...
7107680	7113680	I mean, honestly, you're talking to a person who's just at the end of his rope.
7113680	7114680	I just feel like such an idiot.
7114680	7116680	I've changed my mind so many times on this job.
7116680	7117680	The guy killed me.
7117680	7118680	We didn't do anything right.
7118680	7120680	I'm a bad shadow runner.
7120680	7122680	We got tricked by a ghoul magnet.
7124680	7130680	Hordegar fires off a shock round in the direction of the thrashing beast.
7133680	7135680	In the hopes that this will stop him from golfing.
7135680	7136680	You mean the ghoul, right?
7136680	7137680	Yes, the ghoul.
7137680	7139680	You do that, and it does that.
7139680	7141680	I noted, Melissa.
7141680	7144680	So at least we've solved this half of the question.
7144680	7145680	Melanie.
7145680	7146680	Melanie.
7147680	7149680	No, no, I know my place now.
7149680	7150680	That's okay.
7156680	7158680	The ghoul is down for the count.
7159680	7161680	Ghoul magnet.
7161680	7165680	All right, well...
7165680	7166680	But not forever.
7166680	7168680	In the interim, you two can work this out for yourselves.
7168680	7169680	Well, now you know what happens.
7169680	7172680	We're going to figure out how to end the chapter.
7174680	7176680	Dramatic pickup of the briefcase?
7176680	7177680	The briefcase.
7177680	7178680	It's an empty briefcase.
7178680	7179680	Wait a minute.
7179680	7181680	Somebody gave us this ghoul magnet, right?
7181680	7182680	Yeah.
7182680	7183680	Oh, but who?
7183680	7186680	The people that were here and shot everybody.
7186680	7187680	I wasn't...
7187680	7188680	I don't know.
7188680	7189680	I'm new to this story.
7189680	7190680	I don't know.
7191680	7193680	It's the people they hired us.
7193680	7194680	They...
7194680	7195680	We don't know who they are.
7195680	7198680	They're the people that wanted the information about the BTL chips.
7198680	7199680	Oh, I know.
7199680	7202680	Can we look at, like, a serial number on the ghoul magnet,
7202680	7204680	trace it back to its manufacturer,
7204680	7206680	and then find out who ordered it and all that kind of stuff.
7206680	7207680	Why not?
7207680	7209680	I mean, the funniest thing in the world would be if we ended up
7209680	7212680	on a different adventure at a ghoul magnet factory.
7215680	7216680	That's a big response.
7216680	7219680	Thank you for responding to the Holocaust.
7221680	7222680	Thank you.
7225680	7228680	Ryan Ridley, our guest comptroller.
7228680	7232680	Melanie, our Australian doctor friend.
