81880	83040	don't get to see me that often, right?
83040	90480	How many people are from Florida?
90480	91480	One person raised their hand.
91480	99040	There's nothing wrong with that, I don't know why I'm pointing it out, whatever.
99040	104800	There's no kids here, is there?
104800	107800	I didn't know how this was billed or what this is.
107800	117840	My podcast is talking about my wiener and porn and whatever comes to mind.
117840	118840	Your wiener?
118840	122720	My wiener usually comes to mind.

135320	139120	It's their seventh con this year, right?
139120	144560	I had one job, I could have learned the name of the fucking convention, and I am truly
144560	145560	true.
145560	146560	I didn't even know what Spencer was.
146560	147560	No, you nailed that.
147560	148560	He's a grand dragon.

153560	156560	Are we going to play the KKK today?
156560	157560	Yeah, yeah.
157560	162560	An exciting new special edition of Harmontown.
162560	168560	That might be a discomfortingly feasible this far south, I don't know.
168560	172160	It's going to be the only Harmontown I won't say nigger in.
172160	173160	Oh Jesus.
177160	180160	I said I won't.
180160	182160	Jesus.
182760	185760	I'm moving on.
185760	190760	We have different philosophies about the use of that word.
190760	195760	I only use it while freestyling in my kitchen.
195760	199760	Or with pet names with women.
199760	202760	It's true, I'll come clean about that stuff.
202760	208760	Because for me it's not like an evil word, I don't believe in hocus pocus, words are
208760	209760	bad and all that stuff.
210360	219360	I believe in social, I put myself in the shoes of a person of color and I wouldn't
219360	224360	want to be put in a position where people are always having to look to check with you
224360	226360	and somebody would be like don't put that on me.
226360	227360	That's why I know.
227360	228360	I just hate black people.
228360	232360	I mean I wish I didn't because they're great.
232360	235360	They're amazing people.
235360	239360	But I can't help it.
239360	242960	Maybe we'll have one up later and we'll try to get you through this.
242960	243960	I would love to learn.
243960	244960	I would love to learn.
244960	246460	I'm always open to things.
246460	247460	I'm open.
247460	248460	I don't really know.
248460	251960	You know, I kind of thought well this will be easy because these are my people and
254460	256760	but I'm just realizing now I got I got I got nothing.
258060	259860	But oh, we're no seriously.
259860	264060	I really have nothing because where's my well, I just I just what would you say,
264060	264460	sir?
265460	266060	We're sorry.
266060	266860	I say it again.
267860	270760	Where's where's Ty?
270760	273060	Oh, Ty, you're talking about Ty.
275060	278560	Ty Brixton, the world's smallest show promoter.
278560	281660	Yeah, so a little character that we did on the show once.
281660	286260	I don't know if you ever talked about this, but remember when I was talking about giving
286260	287760	a transvestite a blowjob?
287760	288460	Yes.
288460	289760	No, I did talk about that.
289760	294060	But I will say I listened to the recording of me talking about it and I was not I did
294060	296460	a bad job of relaying what the right of it was.
296460	301860	But yeah, I was like, yeah, I was because I was I was talking about blowing this and
301860	303460	I couldn't I didn't know what I don't know.
303460	306560	You know, I didn't know if it was a guy or do I call it a guy or girl?
306560	306860	I did.
306860	308560	And I said, I don't want to be Archie Bunker here.
310060	316060	Well, talking about making love to a transgender person or yeah.
316760	317660	Yeah, which is funny.
317660	321260	But then you did a funny Archie Bunker imitation cheese meathead.
321260	322660	Yeah, I did it off of them too.
322660	323660	They didn't like it.
323660	325860	They're young and they they're like first of all,
325860	326660	what is that?
326660	327460	What is Archie Bunker?
327460	329760	Second of all, you're transphobic.
330960	331960	It's not to you.
331960	332860	It's funny.
332860	334860	It's an ironic because you think you're not.
334860	335960	But to us, you are.
335960	339060	And and I'm like, well, it's hard to perform for the kids.
339760	341860	Yeah, no, they're they keep getting younger.
343160	345560	Or no, they stay the same age and we keep getting older.
347760	348160	No, I don't.
348160	349760	Where's where's my where's my notes?
350560	351860	We drove into
353860	354360	what do you call it?
354360	354960	Miami.
356860	359560	Today and of course, we wanted to listen to the Will Smith song.
359560	364360	He made a whole he made a rapping song about about about Miami.
364360	366560	He's a good rapper that that Will Smith.
366560	369460	I think he really he should have stuck with that.
369460	370460	I don't know what happened.
370460	371360	He's a talented.
371360	372460	He's a talented person.
372460	375760	And yeah, you but his I hear he's great.
377160	377960	I don't like him.
379960	383260	You guys may be too young to remember this, but he was on Barbara
383460	386760	Walters once like like after like on the heels of Independence Day.
386760	390960	It's like Will Smith taking over the world by storm.
391160	392360	I'm sitting with him now.
392360	394860	And then she was like in the interview, she's like, so you have
394860	397460	an interesting theory about AIDS.
397460	399360	And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.
399360	400760	She's like, tell it to us.
400760	404360	She's just like was stringing him out, stringing him out, stringing along.
405560	411160	And he's like, well, it's you know, you can't tell me that
411160	414160	that disease was not created by the government.
414160	415960	And she's like, really?
415960	417860	I think a lot of people can tell you that.
417860	420160	I mean, but he just like he went for it.
421760	425960	He's he's he's one of the only people that I could think of, because like back
427060	429560	his parents are Scientologists and he's just being respectful.
429560	434660	Like I'm sure you guys are big fans of Judaism, Judaism.
436460	440460	Everyone who isn't a big fan, even if by proxy through its sequel,
440460	446860	Christianity, but but the the know who's the guy that we lost
446860	451460	the Hugo Award to the he's the Josh Wheaton of sci fi.
451460	455660	So it's just we need Neil Gaiman.
455660	459860	Neil Gaiman is a I read like I'm really actually because I had heard
459860	460960	he's a Scientologist.
460960	463760	I was actually really touched by by looking into it.
464060	467960	Yeah, well, he's he's not he's his parents are listen.
467960	469760	Hold up, just let him talk.
471360	472460	Yeah, Dan, let him talk.
472460	474060	Yes, his parents are.
474060	478260	And he's respectful of the like he's just it's like the same way.
478260	480060	I'm Lutheran, which I am not.
480060	480660	I don't know.
480660	482060	How do you be Lutheran or not?
482060	484760	Like it's like I don't it's my parents are Lutheran.
484760	487260	And like I would say that I thought that was sweet.
487260	488360	There's a lot of people like that.
488360	489360	You're like, oh, he is.
489360	490860	I respected that person.
490860	492160	Well, what do you mean they are?
492160	493560	And I'm not.
493560	495060	And by the way, if there's a Scientologist in here,
495060	497360	I'm sure you're already offended and there's nothing I could do about that.
497460	500860	But I but I but I but I truthfully don't.
500860	502560	I mean, I like whatever.
502560	504360	I I'm not going to explain that.
504360	505160	I mean, you know, harm.
505160	510860	I your religion is hilarious to us like like like the people
510860	513060	that pay less for religion.
513060	517460	Like we find it funny and it's like it's funny to us.
517460	519660	But we also recognize I'm sure because we're open minded people
519660	523360	that we shouldn't we're not we don't want you to be different.
523860	527060	We hope you're we hope you're very happy.
528060	531360	Anyways, Will Smith is the only famous Scientologist
531360	535560	I know of who I think is like like John Travolta was like
535560	537760	before he auditioned for Welcome Back Carter.
537760	538660	He was a Scientologist.
538660	542460	So like there's a story about him like being in an acting class
542460	546060	in the Celebrity Center or whatever and going I got this.
546060	548060	I got an audition later today.
549460	553860	It's for something called Welcome Back Carter and and the teacher
553860	554860	being like everyone.
554860	557960	I want you to point in the direction of Paramount Studios
558460	561760	where Jonathan has his audition today and I want you to beam
561760	563660	your UFO energies.
563660	564760	I met and see it.
564760	566860	It's oh, yeah, I was at your show and I'm a Scientologist
566860	568160	and you called it UFO energy.
569460	570760	You keep it a secret.
570960	572060	So I don't know what it is.
572060	575660	We beam beam your xenon's over to the to the pheromones.
575860	579260	And so my point being that like everybody's like like they're
579260	582060	in it when they're younger and they're like their career takes
582060	583760	off and that but Will Smith.
583760	586660	It seems like he's the one guy that was like he woke up.
586660	588360	He had all the money in the world.
588360	590560	He had all the success and he was like, there's still something
590560	593960	missing and he's like, oh, this is great.
594460	595460	That's notable to me.
597160	603560	But you you you Spencer you me Spencer did it Spencer picked
603560	603660	up.
603660	605260	I hope this becomes a thing for him.
605660	609360	Spencer picked up on this thing that Will Smith does and all
609360	621260	this really confident insincere laugh Will Smith always
621260	621860	in his raps.
621860	624360	He always sounds like he's jumping in through a French
624360	627660	window with a rose in his teeth.
629960	632960	And he has this he has this wreck as we listen to the Miami
632960	633260	song.
633260	638660	We're like worse than I remember but because Apple music
638660	642360	now just is Skynet and just keeps playing like it started
642360	643460	playing all these Will Smith songs.
643460	646860	And we heard this this rap called it's a freak.
646860	647460	I'm a freak.
647460	648260	I'm going to freak.
648560	652060	I'm going to get freaky or freaking freaking it freaking
652060	652360	it.
652560	653360	I'm going to freaking it.
653360	657060	He's he he comes at the concept of freaking it so many different
657060	657360	angles.
657360	658560	He's getting his riff.
658560	660660	The refrain is just him over.
660660	663160	He says he says a million different things about freaking
663160	666060	it like like like like he goes like y'all don't mind if I if
666060	668860	I start freaking it but and he's like I don't care.
668860	669960	I don't care what you want.
669960	673060	I'm going to freak in it and then it's like hey who here
673060	674160	wants me to start freaking it?
674160	675160	It's like what do you weigh?
675160	677060	Are you a populist or an elitist?
677060	677660	I don't understand.
677660	681160	Like did you care who's listening or did you do your acting
681160	683660	all like like like detached but then here it's like you just
683660	684960	to keep saying all these different things.
684960	687060	You can't pin him down in a position and you don't even know
687060	689360	what he never starts freaking it as far as we know.
689760	694860	He just got but he in this rap he go.
694860	700360	He alludes to the fact he goes like yeah, and I I I he doesn't
700360	701060	rap like that.
703260	704060	Sutter rap.
705860	707360	It's Christian Bale in the big short.
707360	708760	That's my my story.
709360	716260	The God he goes I I even I even read in the paper that somebody
716260	717460	said I was soft.
717660	719360	Yeah, like Mike.
719360	727460	It's a soft rhyme and it's rhyming soft with soft so it's
727460	731160	not a compelling argument either way and he thinks Microsoft
731160	731860	is hard.
731860	732360	Yeah.
733560	737860	And software company micro means small like if the company
737860	741660	was mega soft like like like a little bit like you'd be like
741660	742060	okay.
742060	745060	I guess he was like kind of like you think I'm flaccid.
745060	746760	I also have a little penis.
746760	747260	Right.
748460	754560	Yeah, flat flaccid more like more like Lake Placid.
759260	760960	One of our most erect lakes.
763560	767160	Anyone who uses the term freaky by the way is not freaky.
767260	772160	You know, like the song super freak, you know, how he describes
772160	772560	freaky.
772560	775860	She's a very sexy girl incense wine and candles.
777260	778560	You don't know what freaky is.
778660	780360	That's Playboy massage freaky.
781260	784660	That's a that we had Hugh Hefner is selling the Playboy
784660	786660	Mansions with him in it though.
786660	789360	Yeah, he did you guys hear about that?
789560	792360	You can buy his you can buy the Playboy Mansion for 200
792360	793260	million dollars.
793260	797360	There's a but you have to live with you're buying a nursing
797360	798360	home that you have to work at.
798360	802060	Yeah, I want someone to I want to like a millionaire to buy
802060	805760	it and just put it in like a big glass dome just like this
806060	809860	This is like once you I like if I had 200 million dollars,
809860	811660	I'd be like what can I do anything?
811660	815260	I want with his corpse like after he dies as it like is it
815260	816960	like is it like Sunset Boulevard?
816960	820260	Like essentially to move in and like he's just in one bedroom
820260	822960	and like you bring up soup and leave it outside the door.
822960	826960	Well, I think he can feed himself, but he gets the whole
827060	828260	he gets the whole place.
828260	830260	Like you can't say you stay up here.
830260	831360	I'll take the bottom floor.
831360	834560	No, he's cruising into your bathroom and like he's doing
834560	835260	all the stuff.
835260	838460	He and I think it also includes like some of his girlfriends
838460	840860	to they're going to be living with you, which is kind of
840860	843760	you know, that's that's that's that's read the description
843760	846860	of the there was the whistleblower young lady who
846860	850660	described what it finally after like 60 years of like like
850660	853160	oh you have to or does he or does he does he have sex with
853160	855460	all those women and so on and there's finally like there's
855460	857760	this woman that just she just laid it out.
857760	860460	She's like a typical night in Hugh Hefner's house.
860460	862360	If you're one of these like playmates that's allowed to
862360	864860	live in a house, it sounded so fucking horrible.
865160	868260	Like like there was like a because it's like there's like
868260	871760	a hierarchy like there's like a slightly the girl with
871760	874960	seniority is kind of like indoctrinating the younger women
874960	876860	and it's like you just go in his room and he's watching
876860	879560	porn and then you have to do the stuff and I mean I'm all
879560	880660	for the porn part.
880660	883860	I like I just like like the idea that like like I mean
883860	887860	what anyways, I was I was at the Playboy Mansion.
887860	889860	It's smells like mildew.
889860	893860	It's how much are they selling it for because whatever
893860	895760	you're selling it for you're gonna have to pay that much
895760	897460	just clean out the hot tub.
897460	899460	Yeah, right.
899460	901960	Yeah, it's just I already told them the podcast the story
901960	904360	when I was at the Playboy Mansion for its 50th anniversary
904360	907160	the magazine's 15th anniversary that my encounter my
907160	909660	own Rob Schwab encountering David Hasselhoff.
909660	911660	We go we go.
911660	912860	I'm now I'm going to tell it again.
912860	914860	I don't know what number what number is it?
914860	916460	I'll listen later.
916460	917960	I don't know that story.
917960	918460	I don't care.
918460	920360	It's like I just love going through it because it's like
920360	921460	it was just an odd.
921460	923260	I just like we go like there's David Hasselhoff.
923260	925060	I just like and we were we were really high.
925060	928260	I think it's okay to say that the I mean for me it is.
928260	930660	I don't know if Rob like Rob gets high and he's directing.
930660	932560	Let your eye on incest.
934560	937260	The but we were like and we were like, oh my God,
937260	939960	David Hasselhoff and I was like, yeah, but let's not bug him
939960	941460	and Rob's like, it's the Playboy Mansion.
941460	943760	Everyone's bugged by each other.
943760	946460	Like it's like this is like corniest place and like we'll
946460	947760	we'll always wonder what would have happened.
947760	948060	Let's go.
948060	952060	We got to talk to Knight Rider and like and we go up to him
952060	954160	and we and then he's like and he's like nine feet tall.
954160	956660	And then we got like we got like hey, we made a pilot.
956660	957860	It was based on you.
957860	958760	That's what Rob said.
959560	962460	He's talking about he visioned Jack and which had a talking
962460	964860	motorcycle and it was very much it was inspired by Knight
964860	968260	Rider and and and and and and and and and Hasselhoff guys
968260	969560	like what really?
971560	973960	Yeah, it was it was it was inspired by Knight Rider.
973960	976960	So it was it's like it's like it's it's a it's a Valentine
976960	981560	to you and he's like who directed that and we go Ben
981560	986560	Stiller and he goes like oh it what else did he do and and
986560	990960	Rob goes Zoolander and David Hasselhoff goes Zoolander's
990960	991960	based on me.
994760	997860	And I swear to God I would I would be the first to self
997860	1001360	deprecate but I'm not exaggerating this is a three
1001360	1004060	second pause and Rob and I in unison went yes.
1005260	1006160	I walked away.
1006160	1012960	Cause we had gotten everything we would get and I picture
1012960	1017160	him going home and watching Zoolander calling his lawyer.
1017660	1020760	So it is have you seen this and he's like I don't know
1020760	1022160	what you're talking about David.
1023160	1025460	No, it's clear once you once you point it out.
1025460	1026460	It's obvious.
1027660	1030560	He's telling that story on his podcast in Germany or wherever
1031260	1038260	I mean Zoolander I had to I had to make a tinkle before
1038260	1041760	I came on stage and and Dustin Marshall our producer here
1041760	1042960	from Feral Audio.
1042960	1047260	He he took it upon himself.
1048260	1050160	We won't go to find the bathroom together.
1050160	1052860	We had to walk through a lot of stuff and it was it was a
1052860	1053460	long one.
1053460	1055860	A couple elevator rides and what's a long journey to find
1055860	1059760	a bathroom right through that wall like right there.
1059760	1060960	Yeah, but there's no door.
1061160	1061460	Yeah.
1063560	1066960	Well, we eventually found it was like we walked in and
1066960	1069360	there was just like there's just like four urinals along
1069360	1071460	the wall that Dustin was like, whoa.
1071460	1073160	It's like P City in here.
1074860	1077360	It's like we had found the National Treasure vault.
1079760	1080360	That reminds me.
1080360	1082160	I walked into the bathroom once and there was a janitor.
1082160	1083860	He's like, ah, fuck.
1083960	1084760	I said, what's the matter?
1084760	1087360	He's like smells like shit and piss in here.
1087760	1090660	You're a janitor in a toilet.
1092660	1096460	Yeah, yeah, yeah, people who are shocked at their jobs.
1096460	1101060	I we had this weird flight delay today where we we got
1101060	1105360	an airplane at LAX and I'm going to round the numbers off
1105360	1105560	here.
1105560	1107860	I don't know the exact ones, but it's like basically four
1107860	1115760	hours from Miami and but we we were in the air and I guess
1115760	1118060	I was asleep and so was the guy next to me.
1118260	1119960	Oh, so first of all, sorry.
1119960	1122660	Let me let me start at the beginning because I had a
1122660	1123960	terrible day today.
1125360	1128460	First-class American Airlines, the worst.
1128860	1129460	Sorry.
1129760	1130360	No, no, no.
1130660	1132660	I'm not going to complain more about airlines.
1133060	1134460	These things happened on a plane.
1134460	1136160	I'm the bad guy and most of it.
1137160	1140860	I get I get I get on the plane and I'm like, there's my
1140860	1144460	ticket says five B.
1146060	1150060	And I look and I got like and it says aisle and I get and
1150060	1153260	there's a guy that's kind of like he's got I see on his
1153260	1153660	ticket.
1153660	1154060	Oh, I'm sorry.
1154060	1156260	It says five B on his ticket that why is that important
1156260	1157660	because someone's going to fact-check it and go if you
1157660	1159060	were in five B weren't in the aisle.
1160060	1161060	I don't blame you.
1161060	1164560	I have the same neuro, neuro, neurological disorder.
1164560	1164860	You do.
1166060	1168060	Like I just don't talk to himself folks.
1170660	1173160	But he's like I can see on his ticket that says five B.
1173160	1176960	So I know he's sitting in that aisle and I'm five A but
1176960	1179260	he's like he's talking to some lady.
1179260	1183260	That's like a row ahead and he but it's going like oh, I
1183260	1187560	don't I don't know if I have a window or and I'm like thinking
1187560	1188060	in my head.
1188160	1190860	I don't care if you don't like the window.
1190860	1192260	You're not going to pull one of these things.
1192260	1194660	Like I'm just thinking at my head and he's like, I don't
1194660	1194760	know.
1194960	1197860	It says I'm five A but as I said, it's the window.
1197860	1199260	I appointed at the diagram.
1199260	1201560	I said there's a drawing of a guy and a window next to his
1201560	1206660	head and there's no confusion lately and then he starts
1206660	1207260	sitting down.
1207260	1209760	But then it turns out the lady in the row ahead.
1210060	1213760	She's like it becomes clear that there are a couple and
1213760	1216760	they're traveling together and she's like, I don't know why
1216760	1219160	they would sit me up here.
1219160	1221560	And I said, oh, do you want to switch seats?
1221660	1223260	And she's like, you would do that for us?
1223360	1224260	I said, well, of course.
1224260	1228560	I mean, you know, like what you guys sit there.
1228560	1230560	It's like which thank you.
1230560	1231260	Thank you very much.
1232260	1238560	I've not since 9-11 has bravery been acknowledged.
1240560	1242660	It's got it's got it's and I was starting to get a little
1242660	1244160	pissed off that people didn't applaud.
1246460	1250060	Thank you for you know, it's like they're selfish people.
1250260	1252760	They don't they don't know heroism when they hear about
1252760	1255660	it because that was the end of my story.
1255660	1257860	I switched seats because they didn't applaud.
1257860	1260960	I was going to start making shit up because I was embarrassed
1260960	1261860	for you.
1263460	1268660	No, I the I go, I'll switch these with you and I but I
1268660	1272060	specifically said I said, so this is your seat, right?
1272060	1276260	And I point at for B, which is the window.
1276260	1276660	I'm sorry.
1276660	1279160	I keep switching these letters around, but it's at four B.
1279960	1280860	Yes, that's my seat.
1280860	1284760	And I go, okay, because obviously I wouldn't want to,
1286060	1289060	you know, screw with whoever else is sitting or whatever,
1289060	1291460	but it's like so oh, thank you so much.
1291660	1295260	So she sits there in 5A next to her husband in 5B and I
1295260	1298560	go into 4B and I and there's like cookie packages and shit.
1298560	1300560	I just start like throwing shit around.
1300560	1301860	I've got you know, it's my home now.
1301860	1303260	I installed a ceiling fan.
1303260	1304860	I fucking there's a pillow.
1304860	1310860	I drew a face on it and like like I threw it out the window
1310860	1314660	of the plane and like like like like rub my butt all over
1314660	1317560	the seat to make it nice and warm and and then this couple
1317560	1319060	comes out and they look at and they did.
1319060	1321860	They look at me and they're just like like like like they
1321860	1322560	have this look on your face.
1322560	1324560	Like what is this homeless Kevin Smith?
1324560	1330460	Like and they're like and I'm like and I know the look and
1330460	1333160	so and I turned to the woman behind me and I go, did you
1333160	1335360	give me someone else's seat?
1336660	1339360	Really accusing like I did not rise above it at all.
1340860	1342360	And she was like, oh, I'm sorry.
1342360	1344560	Well, I don't I read she holds up her ticket.
1344560	1345860	It says 3B.
1346860	1349860	What do you how are you if you had a whole conference?
1349860	1350160	Yes.
1350160	1350760	Thank you.
1351160	1357060	I think you're applauding maybe her but I think that person
1357060	1358060	has an OCD thing.
1358060	1359760	I don't think they're applauding for you.
1360760	1361960	They're flapping as I was.
1361960	1363760	You're you're stimming.
1363760	1364260	You're stimming.
1364260	1366760	There's no connection to anything good.
1368860	1371260	What sorry, what's that Tourette's?
1371260	1372260	Yes, I'm okay.
1372260	1372660	I'm sorry.
1372660	1373560	I asked what you said.
1376060	1378160	Maybe it's possible in a strange way.
1378160	1379160	You have Tourette's.
1379160	1380160	Sounds like you have Tourette's.
1381160	1382260	He has meta Tourette's.
1382260	1384160	He just shouts the word Tourette's out.
1384860	1385660	He has Tourette's!
1386260	1387160	He has Tourette's!
1388260	1389060	He has Tourette's!
1389060	1389560	Whoop!
1389560	1390060	Whoop!
1390060	1390560	Whoop!
1394560	1395160	Okay, Dan.
1395160	1395860	I was at your show.
1395860	1400960	I'm a Scientologist with Tourette's and I consider this
1400960	1403660	my letter of resignation from your fandom.
1403660	1405860	We are offending a lot of people tonight.
1408160	1408560	I get it.
1408560	1408960	I get it.
1408960	1412860	So so so I go so that so so I have to go now.
1412860	1414260	I have to go all the way up to 3B.
1414460	1417960	So now and the guy in 3A, he's already done.
1417960	1420160	He's this is so late in the stage.
1420160	1422660	And so he was thinking like oh shit, man.
1422960	1424660	I got I got an empty seat next to me.
1424660	1428360	He's got socks and laundry and fucking backpacks and pretzels
1428360	1430060	and and I feel bad for him.
1430060	1431160	I feel bad for myself.
1431160	1433560	I'm just I really it's just a what it's a.
1433560	1436560	Cluster fuck and they and I sit I sit down next to him.
1436560	1439060	So that's that's the end of that chapter of the story, but
1439060	1439960	it continues.
1439960	1441360	It gets so fascinating.
1443260	1446360	So me and this gentleman, we fall asleep together in our
1447160	1449760	like next to each other on the plane at some point.
1450060	1455360	So at some point during the flight, what like we missed
1455360	1458960	them saying ladies and gentlemen, it's so foggy in Miami
1459760	1461360	that we're landing in Orlando.
1462260	1466060	And we we both missed that announcement and just woke up
1466060	1469460	at some point and and and we're descending on this city
1469660	1472260	and he's looking out the window and he starts going.
1472460	1474060	He goes, that's not Miami.
1481860	1484160	And I'm like, oh, yeah.
1484960	1494160	I was like, what do you mean?
1494160	1496960	And he's like, I'm serious.
1496960	1497760	That's not Miami.
1498860	1500760	And I was I swear to God.
1500760	1503260	I'm like, I'm so embarrassed.
1504060	1505560	Obviously, this ends with my comeuppance.
1505560	1508060	But like I was like, so I was riding this high.
1508060	1509760	I was like, it's so patronizing to him.
1509760	1514060	I was like, I think you know, you get in a metal tube.
1515160	1518260	And and it goes like this for a while.
1518260	1520760	And I think it always ends up in the city you bought the
1520760	1521260	ticket to.
1521260	1524260	It's just my experience with air travel.
1525260	1528160	And he's like, I'm from Miami.
1528160	1529460	That is not Miami.
1533160	1536360	I said, I said, it's a bunch of glowing lights.
1536360	1539060	It's a it's a grid of roofs.
1540360	1543360	I mean, maybe maybe you have city blindness.
1545160	1547260	To me, it looks like it could be Miami.
1547260	1548560	It could be Copenhagen.
1548560	1552460	I don't like I just I'm never, you know, I don't judge by
1552460	1553260	this distance.
1553260	1555460	I like you said, you wouldn't know LA.
1558060	1559860	I'm like, guys kind of chuckling because I'm really
1559860	1561060	really I want to make it clear.
1561060	1563060	I'm really busting the guys balls.
1566560	1569760	I'm like, let's you and I will land the plane.
1569860	1571460	We'll get out very carefully.
1571460	1572360	We'll peek out.
1573360	1575260	We'll find a newspaper.
1579260	1581860	And he's and he's like, he's like, he's not laughing anymore
1581860	1583160	because he's like, he's like, I'm serious.
1583160	1583760	I'm from Miami.
1583760	1584360	That's not Miami.
1584360	1585860	I'm like, okay, okay, okay, okay.
1586760	1590660	So so then the crazy thing is because they already told
1590660	1592560	everybody what we were asleep.
1592560	1597160	They don't then say, okay, like like like the plane lands
1597160	1600860	in this city that and and and and they still haven't said
1600860	1603160	they said it before and so they don't say it again.
1603260	1605860	They just like land and then and then they're like, okay,
1605860	1609860	everybody just just hold on just so like and we'll we'll
1609860	1611560	get you will get everybody where they're going as soon
1611560	1614260	as the problems over and it was what problem what's happening
1614460	1617260	and then there's like there's a guy after like 20 minutes
1617260	1619960	a guy walks up with his luggage to the front of the plane
1620160	1622060	and he's like, I'm getting out.
1622160	1623060	I want to get out of the plane.
1623060	1625160	It's like you can't get out of the plane.
1625560	1626660	Because you can't do that.
1626660	1628960	If you give you get out of the plane, you're in the wrong
1628960	1629560	place.
1630060	1632160	And I'm like, what the hell are we on the tarves?

1651960	1654960	that are wanting to get off the plane and it's their right
1654960	1658660	to do so, but it's it's it's not a good idea.
1658660	1661560	If you do get off the plane and I don't recommend it,
1661560	1662860	don't go far.
1664560	1666760	I went what the fuck is happening?

1689460	1692360	finally did and then oh, oh so that guy says she finishes
1692360	1695160	shaming that guy and then she's like she goes she goes
1695160	1697360	I reckon we're going to turn out the lights and everybody
1697360	1698360	should take a nap.
1698360	1699360	That's what she said.
1702860	1705160	It's like a Jonestown thing is happening.
1706360	1711260	And then I said I get I said then 28 seconds after that
1711560	1713160	based on some visual cue.

1729560	1730560	So why are you napping?
1730560	1733560	Get off but but but don't go far.
1733560	1739260	And I got up and I put on my backpack and I said I don't
1739260	1740360	think this is Miami.
1741760	1743060	And the guys like I know.
1745960	1747660	And we went out and it was Orlando.
1748660	1751260	And I got I bought a bunch of I bought a bunch of salmon

1758660	1760560	But there was a lady there was a lady.
1760560	1763560	We went to a sandwich restaurant and the woman at the
1763560	1768260	sandwich restaurant was confused frustrated.
1768460	1771860	She couldn't believe what she got up that morning to work
1771860	1774160	at her airport sandwich store.
1774960	1778660	She's like what she was saying was next.

1787960	1791260	I said I'll have a ham egg and bacon.
1791260	1792960	We have ham and cheese.
1792960	1793560	We have bacon.
1793560	1796360	She's like I fucked up and I was like I'll have I'll have
1796360	1796960	that one.
1797060	1801060	And she's like and I was like the unspoken part of her
1801060	1804860	statement was like how how can this be happening to me?
1806160	1811560	How can a plane land next to my sandwich counter and all of
1811560	1815660	these hungry people are just lining up and wanting sandwiches
1815660	1817160	I come here to read.
1820160	1821960	And I stole a bag of Doritos.
1827760	1829860	I knew you guys would get that in LA.
1829860	1834260	They'd boo that fucking my style.
1836260	1837960	This place invented vice.
1840660	1841960	And then I fucked a baby.
1846060	1849660	And then I fed it to a job crocodiles or alligators.
1851360	1852960	Yeah, you know what?
1852960	1855560	It was an alligator, but I sharpened its nose and turned
1855560	1856660	it into a crocodile.
1859860	1867460	No, I stole a bag of Doritos.
1867460	1868960	I grabbed it.
1869260	1871460	I opened it and just started eating it and I went up to
1871460	1873660	the counter and I was like, I just like I waited for her to
1873660	1874460	charge me for it.
1874460	1876660	I was like, I'll have a sandwich and I was just like I
1876660	1879860	want I just I was like I was like I'm stealing Doritos and

1909160	1910660	There's nothing funny about this, but it's just I just
1910660	1913660	find it incredibly ironic that we got in a that's a four
1913660	1918460	hour flight from LA to Miami and we we were then four hours
1918460	1919860	from Miami by car.

1956560	1960160	as like an airline if they if they're scared to land even
1960160	1963560	if it means because they think they suck like I can't do

2667960	2670460	definite that it's going to happen and it's like I don't
2670460	2674960	want to hear it like like what is the first thing that happens
2674960	2678060	is like a pain in your side or you start sweating on your
2678060	2678660	upper lip.
2678660	2680060	You look like Richard Nixon.
2681260	2682660	And you start sweating like a dog.

2703460	2704660	You pay somebody extra.
2704660	2709160	Yeah, you really wish somebody would just hit you in the
2709160	2712960	side with a baseball bat to get the pain to go away, but
2712960	2713960	that would hurt.
2713960	2715160	No, it doesn't.
2715160	2718560	But don't can't you just take the drugs and write it out?
2718560	2721060	No, it's there's two kinds of pain with it.
2721060	2726060	The one of the cutting which is no funny through your body.
2726860	2729760	And then when it can't move anymore the urine backs up and
2729760	2732560	then that pain hurts like a motherfucker.
2733060	2736160	You cannot believe it and you can't get comfortable.
2736160	2739060	There's no place to like get comfortable at all.

3148460	3149060	Yeah.
3149860	3153960	I was dating a 42 year old woman and she said you want to throw
3153960	3154860	that shit around.
3154860	3156260	You better get a vasectomy.
3156860	3157760	Throw a throat.

3163760	3164760	You throw it around.
3165160	3167460	I thought if you turn around you couldn't get any you come in
3167460	3168660	your hands and go bad.
3173060	3174160	Pay extra for that.
3175060	3176160	You're like a monkey.

3206060	3209460	offensive to assume that the reason she was particularly

3273560	3274360	that came out the same time.
3274360	3276960	Poison ivy and then there was to wait.
3276960	3277160	Sorry.
3277160	3277760	What'd you say?
3277860	3279560	Drew Barrymore.
3279560	3280660	Was she poison ivy?
3282560	3285360	Uma Thurman was but no, you guys stop that.
3286160	3286860	Are you serious?
3286860	3287660	You're that young.
3287660	3288160	You don't remember.
3288160	3299660	There was a movie about it was like I've written everyone
3299660	3300160	in the audience.
3300160	3301560	Please come up here and grab a mic.
3301660	3303260	All right.
3303260	3305960	Well, let's let's let's let's let's have a hand for Rick
3305960	3317660	and thank you for sharing your your your I like that he
3317660	3318360	earned it too.
3318360	3322260	Like if we got that information in the wrong order, we
3322260	3323660	would have been like who are you trying to impress?
3323660	3327460	But he's like look sometimes ninja stars made of calcium
3327460	3328760	come out of my dick and it hurts.
3329960	3331060	I got a vasectomy.
3331060	3332360	I live with my parents.
3333360	3334160	One other thing.
3334860	3336160	I fucked my friends.
3340660	3342260	We were rooting for him at that point.
3342260	3344660	Yeah, I want to clear up a misconception.
3344660	3347260	He was 21 when he had sex with that woman and this was
3347260	3347960	out of high school.
3347960	3348360	Okay.
3348360	3350560	Well, they were friends in high school, but this was, you
3350560	3351660	know, after high school.
3351660	3353660	I was sure it's not quite as cool.
3353660	3357660	Well, it's actually it's really cool.
3357660	3358160	Don't get me wrong.
3358160	3361260	It's really cool, but it's not quite as cool as like some
3361260	3362360	high school guy.
3362360	3364160	Yeah, it's not as dramatic.
3364160	3367360	It's arguably a little healthier because you know, it's
3367360	3369560	absolutely that's why it's less cool because high school
3369560	3371660	kids shouldn't be having a lot of people don't know this
3371660	3373560	but Spencer's Rick's biographer.
3373760	3374160	Yeah.
3377160	3378760	Just so happens he's the oldest guy here.

3378960	3380760	No one asked me any questions about it.
3381460	3384460	You are very suspiciously quiet during that interview.
3385360	3386460	Do you have any beats?
3386460	3387860	You got any rap beats?
3388560	3391160	Wait, really?
3391160	3393360	I thought I thought Dustin had some beats.
3393560	3394760	He's getting him.
3394760	3395160	He's getting.
3395160	3395860	Well, oh, sorry.

3426560	3430060	I fucked your mama so hard that she started to cry.
3430060	3432060	But it wasn't it was for joy.
3434860	3437360	Yo, yo, yo.
3437860	3442360	The peninsula of this state is shaped like my wiener.
3442660	3446560	When I go on a date, I like to dip it in the ocean and whip it
3446560	3447360	around.
3447360	3449160	I'm like, Rick.

3479560	3479760	I
3482160	3483960	said it, but it's not related.
3484560	3485360	I'm going to start over.
3485360	3485860	Okay.
3485960	3486460	Yeah.
3486560	3487060	Read.

3489260	3489760	Yeah.
3490160	3490660	Yeah.
3490660	3492460	That's a comic magic.
3492760	3495160	Magic Airport Convention Hall.
3496060	3498560	I fucked your mama and she was appalled.
3498560	3500360	She said, holy shit.
3500660	3501760	You gave it to me.
3501760	3502260	Good.
3502460	3505560	I went in the basement and work with some wood.
3505860	3507660	I built her a rocking chair.
3507660	3508960	I built her a sled.
3509260	3510860	I built her a doghouse.
3510960	3512360	I built her a shed.
3514260	3515660	And a shed in the bed.
3516360	3519060	Most people put a bed in a shed.
3519960	3522660	I put a shed inside the bed.
3523360	3526160	I got inside and I fucked the shed.
3527760	3531360	And then your mama was dead, but I didn't do it.
3531460	3532660	I was framed.
3533860	3534360	Yeah.
3542160	3543160	Oh, God.
3543960	3545060	Where did you go?
3545560	3546460	I went to pee.
3546560	3547060	Awesome.
3547060	3547760	That was amazing.
3547760	3548660	I really rushed.
3548860	3550260	I zipped up too quickly.
3550460	3551160	Oh, no.
3551160	3552760	I put my drink down on your podium.
3554160	3554760	Oh, man.
3554760	3556160	One time I was in the beach.
3556160	3559260	I was at the beach and I got knocked over by a wave and it
3559260	3561960	took my pants off and I had to pull them on and it turned out
3561960	3562760	the zipper was down.
3562760	3565960	So I pulled up my zipper and yeah, that's what happened.
3566260	3569360	Yeah, and and then I was in the salt water.
3569360	3573960	So it was no, no, no, it was instantly disinfected and everything
3573960	3575060	was healthy from then on.
3575060	3576460	Yeah, it was great.
3576460	3577060	No, it was good.
3577060	3577360	Yeah.
3577360	3577660	Yeah.
3577660	3579360	I'm still leaking by the way.
3580360	3582560	Like I just I'm 51.
3582960	3584260	That's not I don't know.
3584260	3588660	I think that just might be technique because I thought I was
3588660	3592760	like 20, but it was just it was my technique was way off having
3592760	3594060	having peed in one of those diapers.
3594060	3596360	I peed in a diaper in I heard.
3596360	3599660	Yeah, it was like it was very brave of me.
3599660	3601160	Does it feel good?
3601360	3602260	It's amazing.
3602260	3607360	It's it's that's why it's hard to toilet train kids.
3607360	3608460	Yeah, because they love it.
3608460	3610860	It's nice and warm, but I didn't know I didn't know I thought
3610860	3612260	it would be damp or something.
3612360	3615260	It's like when you pee in the shower, like that feeling of
3615260	3618660	just like freedom, like you're just like I'm just like that's
3618660	3620960	like I bet it reminds you of being in the womb because you
3620960	3622560	probably just pee in your mom.
3622560	3624460	Like like, I don't think you pee.
3624460	3626360	Yeah, what does happen in there?
3627160	3627560	For sure.
3627560	3628160	You pee.
3628260	3631260	I think the umbilical cord deals with the waste.
3631660	3633060	I don't think you do that.
3633360	3636260	I mean when you are born, it's not like a bunch of shit falls
3636260	3636960	out, right?
3637960	3639160	Because that would happen.
3639260	3640260	Didn't let no.
3641360	3643660	That's what is that what your water breaking is?
3644260	3647560	It's all the it's all it's all in the fetus pee.
3650560	3651060	It's delicious.

3724560	3725060	Yeah.
3726260	3727160	And then it came here.
3727160	3727660	Yeah.
3727660	3729460	Did you get the hotel empanadas?
3729460	3730260	No, no.

3730960	3731460	Yeah.
3731460	3733760	They got slow cooked lamb empanadas.
3733760	3735960	Did you think of what you're trying to think of yet?
3735960	3736960	No, that was it.
3736960	3737660	I wanted to add.
3737660	3738560	Oh, that was it.
3738560	3739560	Oh, I'm sorry about yelling.
3739560	3740060	Are you?

3743960	3744460	No.
3744460	3746260	Well, he challenges me sometimes.
3746260	3747260	I don't do that.
3747460	3750860	But then when he gets drunk, sometimes he gets inexplicably
3750860	3754460	angry about things like chain zingers.
3754460	3754960	This one.
3754960	3755360	Yeah.

3760360	3760860	Wow.
3761060	3763060	Yeah, it's kind of like hanging out with you guys.
3763060	3763560	Yeah.

3774260	3777360	of like it doesn't usually ask like who's in who's in pain,

3838660	3843660	It's made in in copper Kettles and it's from Texas and I'm
3843660	3844160	flustered.

3847860	3848260	Yeah.
3848260	3848560	Yeah.

3861460	3863360	The what are you holding there?
3863360	3864160	Are you a vapon?
3864260	3864760	Oh, yeah.
3864760	3868760	It's a oil pen that has some some has some hash oil in it.
3869160	3869360	Sorry.
3869360	3870260	I'm still holding it.
3870260	3871760	I should be holding it right now.
3871960	3872760	Yeah.
3873260	3875360	So so okay, what's your convention?
3876060	3878660	I actually went to the bathroom to go wash my hands and there
3878660	3882960	was somebody in a very extensive gender swap costume with
3882960	3883460	cosplay.
3883460	3889760	Sorry and I made me take a double take at the door sign and
3889760	3893660	make sure that I wasn't in the females bathroom with a female
3893660	3899160	that had her boyfriend in the bathroom with her and yeah,
3899160	3900860	I just thought there was a female in the bathroom.
3900860	3904260	It just turned out to be a child in a cosplay that was a gender
3904260	3912560	swap and tell the rest of the story and a urinated in my shoe
3912560	3915460	and then I thought about Dino and then I thought about a
3915460	3918560	dominatrix and then I came here and I'm going to throw that
3918560	3919260	tears away.
3920660	3921160	Good.
3921860	3922260	They're out.
3922260	3924160	They're all judging you now because they're like so you
3924160	3926260	encountered the modern world.
3926660	3931060	I'm starting the lights on me and I don't know what to say.
3931060	3934660	What do you think of like so, you know, like like which we
3934660	3937860	should probably at this point we should we should escape the
3937860	3940760	death of the restroom question becomes too complicated.
3940760	3942860	We should just have unisex bathrooms, right?
3942860	3943460	Is that right?
3943460	3945660	Do you give an opinion about that?
3946660	3949560	I mean when it really comes to it, you know, in the 21st
3949560	3953760	century, you know, it shouldn't be really what parts
3953760	3954760	you're born with.
3954760	3956960	It should really be what you're identifying as and what you're
3956960	3959860	presenting as and you should be able to go to the bathroom
3959860	3963760	and you know into the gender that you feel that you right,
3963760	3966160	but do you well, yeah, but I mean, yeah, we all know what to
3966160	3967560	say to that's appropriate.
3969060	3972060	I know I don't doubt that you believe it.
3972060	3973260	I'm just saying like idea.
3973260	3977460	We I'm asking the question given that fact like should we
3977460	3980160	should the should bathroom should we just fuse the bathrooms
3980160	3982060	or should we continue to do dichotomous bath?
3982060	3984460	I don't I don't think women would agree with that women
3984460	3985560	need more bad.
3985560	3988060	Like, you know, how much masturbating there's going to
3988060	3992060	be women's bathroom like biologically need to spend more
3992060	3993260	time in the bathroom.
3993260	3995560	That's not like a sexist thing, but like apparently for peeing
3995560	3997560	it takes longer like physically.
3997560	4001660	So like women need more access to bathrooms than men do per
4001660	4005260	unit space in in a proper urban planning situation.
4005260	4007260	Yeah, which is I mean, I'm not.
4007260	4009860	I'm not trying to shit on your great idea and also, you know
4009860	4013960	how much masturbating there would be a lot of masturbating.
4013960	4018260	I mean, I mean by me, I'm a chicken.
4018260	4020760	So if I was like running society, I would just do the thing
4020760	4023760	that even if it was an inconvenience to like a large group
4023760	4025660	of people, I would be like, well, I just don't want to be
4025660	4026560	doing wrong things.
4026560	4027960	So let's just do the simple thing.
4027960	4030060	That'll mean that no one's ever offended or whatever.
4030060	4033160	Let's merge the bathrooms at but it's that's interesting
4033160	4033660	that it could be.
4033660	4035960	Yeah, you'd be fucking people over in the name of like making
4035960	4039160	me as the mayor of this society feel better about myself
4039360	4042160	because I could just pee well in my pants.
4042160	4042760	I found out.
4044660	4045760	Yeah, last week kind of fun.
4045760	4048260	I could be in your pants and there was like there was a
4048260	4051460	situation in I was in in New York where it occurred to me.
4051460	4053060	I was like, oh man, that sucks for women.
4053060	4056460	Oh, it was because at the library bar there was a men's
4056460	4058760	room in a women's room, but they made them both unisex.
4058760	4061760	And I was like, oh man, that that's about sex for the women
4061760	4064960	because lately that's another thing that used to be women's
4064960	4067560	room. And it's like now it's got fucking because I went in
4067560	4070060	there and the seat was up and there was fucking yeah, go to
4070060	4071960	the drawing room where there's a men's room and a woman's
4071960	4076060	room. The woman's room great place to do coke in men's room.
4076060	4076660	Not so good.
4076660	4078660	You don't want to you don't want anything going through
4078660	4080060	your nose in that place.
4081060	4083660	But maybe we need to just do like tiered bathrooms like
4083660	4084760	platinum bathroom.
4088260	4088660	All right.
4088660	4089360	Well, okay.
4089360	4090560	So what was the costume?
4090560	4092660	Can you tell us are you afraid you're going to like I honestly
4092660	4094960	really don't know is a it was an anime costume.
4094960	4097060	I'm not very familiar with anime.
4097060	4099660	So what do you think of this Deadpool fellow?
4100360	4105660	I think the movie is going to be receptive, but it probably
4105660	4107160	the movie is going to be receptive.
4108260	4109460	What a bold choice.
4112660	4116060	It thought I was a hit says Gene Shalit.
4118060	4119560	Truly receptive film.
4120060	4120560	I'm sorry.
4120560	4121260	I'm so sorry.
4121260	4122460	I'll do anything for a laugh.
4123660	4125960	I'm jumping all over because I never misspeak.
4125960	4127460	Honestly, you're making my day.
4130660	4135460	I just don't think it's going to be the circle jerk that
4135460	4136660	everybody thinks it's going to be.
4136660	4141660	Meaning meaning like but you're saying you don't think
4141660	4144960	it's going to be God's gift to yes, it's not going to be
4144960	4153560	this like uber Mobius strip of meta humor and Deadpool
4153560	4155260	and the whole X-Men thing.
4155260	4157860	I really think they're just going to try to fit in him just
4157860	4161160	acknowledging the crowd and this little humor and this and
4161160	4163660	that and they're really just going to not really do too
4163660	4164160	much with it.
4164160	4164760	What was that?
4164760	4167060	Because I've never seen a single panel of a Deadpool comic,
4167060	4170460	but I've read the Wikipedia page and I appreciate that.
4170460	4174160	I'm sure a bunch of from reading the description of it.
4174160	4176860	I'm like, I'm sure I have a ton of fans that are Deadpool
4176860	4180260	fans and I know Ryan Reynolds is a huge fan of it and like
4180260	4182660	like like I just been wanting to make the movie like what
4182660	4187960	is the what is the like like because I like what is the
4187960	4188660	good version?
4188660	4188960	I know.
4188960	4191360	I kind of know what you're talking about like Spencer
4191360	4193660	never talking about this like there's a bad version of meta
4193660	4195860	like if they do just do it sloppy and lazy that he just
4195860	4197460	goes like oh, it's like I'm in a movie.
4197660	4199460	It's like going to be like Space Jam or something.
4199660	4203660	Is that the the but what's the what's the subtle like
4203660	4206360	sophisticated like what does he do in the comic book that
4206360	4209560	is the like as the good version of breaking the fourth
4209560	4209760	wall?
4209760	4212660	That's what I'm killed confused by to be honest.
4212660	4215460	I haven't read too many but you're our Deadpool expert.
4215460	4216360	I brought you up here.
4217460	4220660	No, it's the what sorry.
4220660	4222260	Do you know I didn't bring in a cocaine a tried.
4222260	4223460	Oh, sorry.
4223460	4224060	No one did.
4225060	4229060	What the fuck down?
4231460	4232560	Holy shit.
4232560	4233660	What the fuck?
4233660	4238460	Why did you just physically get that guy like what?
4238460	4239160	Okay, I try.
4239160	4239860	I tried.
4240060	4241160	Is there security?
4244660	4245560	Are you all right?
4247160	4248460	Jesus Christ.
4249460	4251560	Usually when people rush the stage, nothing.
4251560	4253060	This guy's got a black eye.
4254260	4257060	Well, yeah, yes, you do.
4257660	4259460	I mean, I'm not going to ask if you're okay.
4259460	4260360	I was helping you out.
4261660	4264660	I we thought this was going to be a bad show.
4268260	4269760	I'm sorry that happened to you, man.
4269760	4270860	That's really shitty.
4270960	4274760	I'm like, yeah, I'm so sorry that happened to you.
4274760	4275460	Did it hurt?
4275460	4276960	Okay, it hurt when you got punched.
4276960	4279060	Did it hurt when you fell down in the chair?
4279060	4280260	What about punching him?
4281360	4281960	Wait, what?
4282160	4283560	Just punch this guy.
4284060	4286960	Well, no, don't like he has to be removed.
4286960	4290460	He's an insane person that hurts other people like Jesus.
4290860	4291860	I don't understand.
4293760	4299960	I think yeah, do you do you need do you need?
4299960	4303060	I mean, do you would you know if you needed it like an actual
4303060	4303460	doctor?
4303460	4307060	Do you need like a do you need like a I mean the guy should
4307060	4307860	be arrested.
4307860	4311160	Yeah, I've had a cerebral hematoma before so I know what
4311160	4315060	a concussion and what a blood what blood in your brain feels
4315060	4315460	like.
4315460	4317460	I mean, we should hold on to that guy.
4326060	4328860	So what what in what spirit was that just said?
4328860	4330860	Are you do you think it's funny that he was physically
4330860	4331660	assaulted?
4331760	4333460	I think he was just trying to be funny.
4333760	4335260	No, you're not invited up here.
4335260	4338460	Yeah, please forgive us for not wanting you to run up on
4338460	4339060	stage.
4339060	4339460	It's
4340460	4342460	I think that was somebody I knew.
4342460	4342960	Yes.
4344960	4347060	You know, this wasn't a planned thing.
4347060	4348160	I hope not.
4348660	4350560	That'd be really a bad plan.
4350560	4351960	You can you can explain.
4351960	4354960	Do you I'm going to cater to his comfort right now.
4356460	4356860	What's it?
4356860	4357560	Wait, really?
4360160	4361460	Do you want to press charges?
4361460	4365960	I won't press charges, but and this wasn't planned.
4367860	4369360	I don't think this was planned.
4370460	4373960	It's going to it's going to shine up like I mean, I've had
4373960	4376060	my nose broken by belligerent driver before.
4376060	4378360	So again, it's nothing I haven't been through.
4378460	4378960	It's cool.
4379960	4380760	Florida's great.
4380760	4384360	Yes, but you know, I mean, this is exactly what I expected
4384360	4385360	Florida to be like.
4387260	4387560	So
4393260	4394460	everybody everybody calm down.
4394460	4396760	Let's let's let's say, I mean, don't well, don't calm down.
4396760	4398060	You can continue to be excited.
4398560	4400760	You have my permission to react in an excited way.
4400760	4401760	I don't know how to put this together.
4401760	4405260	Someone else is going to don't don't don't don't don't devolve
4405260	4409960	into I'm interested to let's let's talk about what just
4409960	4410560	happened.
4414160	4415660	Yeah, how do you know this guy?
4418060	4420260	Well, I'm actually known for
4421760	4422960	Jesus here comes
4424360	4425860	like six years.
4426360	4426860	Okay.
4427560	4430660	And I kind of think he
4431660	4436060	he kind of gets himself a little riled up and
4437460	4438860	into situations.
4439560	4440960	I think he was kind of
4446460	4448960	I'm kind of not interested anymore.
4451160	4453860	I don't think his actions were justified, but
4454760	4456760	but you I thought they were I thought he had a
4456960	4457660	great
4459160	4461660	is his point seemed very clear.
4464860	4466860	I want you to try.
4466860	4467760	Are you traumatized?
4467760	4470160	I mean, no offense, but I mean like if that happened to me,
4470460	4472260	I'd be very shaken up.
4472460	4475760	I'd not be able to carry on with these comedic stylings like
4475760	4476160	this.
4477060	4480460	Quite honestly, the only reason why I'm pressing on is only
4480460	4482660	because it gets me more stage time.
4482660	4483160	Yeah.
4485060	4486360	So it was planned.
4486960	4488260	No, it wasn't planned at all.
4488260	4489460	I'm actually really pissed off on him.
4489460	4491760	I'm kind of don't want to give him a ride home right now.
4492660	4495060	I feel like the cops got that covered.
4496160	4497160	Well, can you can you play?
4497160	4499760	You seem to be very you're and it's okay.
4499760	4501160	I don't want you to talk about anything.
4501160	4502560	You don't want to talk about what I'm just saying.
4502560	4503760	I'm just making the observation.
4503860	4504760	I feel my face blowing up.
4504760	4505260	I'm sorry.
4505260	4505760	What's that?
4505760	4507260	I feel my foot my left cheek.
4507260	4509060	Do you want to do you want to do you want to go and put ice
4509060	4510160	on that stuff or do you want to stay here?
4510160	4513060	It's like with that ice here as a guy who was physically
4513060	4513660	assaulted.
4513660	4515960	Whatever you want happens.
4516460	4519360	I've had my nose broken by a belligerent driver down here
4519360	4524260	before so it's not like you're asking for things.
4524760	4527360	No, the people have done your fucking suck a lot.
4528060	4529660	We'd like to talk about that though.
4529960	4532560	And if you don't want to then we can we can we can we can
4532560	4533860	with for your our full support.
4533860	4537260	We can we can do whatever I know.
4537260	4539560	No, I'd move on and then they're going to be like,
4539560	4540760	well, what the fuck is that?
4540760	4543260	Like this show needs to pay attention to the thing that
4543260	4543660	happened.
4544660	4546460	It was his friend.
4546460	4547460	It's your friend.
4547460	4550160	And he said so can I ask you a couple like like like like
4550160	4551460	you're you're you're.
4555160	4555960	Thanks, Steve.
4567460	4570260	Is he is he just like your crazy knucklehead friend?
4570260	4572760	Yeah, he actually lives in Oxnard like about an hour
4572760	4573460	away from you guys.
4573860	4575260	Oh, that's a bad place here.
4575260	4577260	But he moved over there a few years ago.
4577760	4581460	It's just Oxnard like that little like that means like
4581460	4583160	ox testicle, right?
4584460	4588360	Name a city that and I mean, I'm not just saying that
4588360	4589060	because I heard of it.
4589060	4591060	Like I grew up like like you said that's somewhere.
4591060	4594260	I'm used to it's a weird place that people tend not to go.
4594560	4597460	Yeah, is this a relationship like the the runner Herzog
4597460	4602060	movie my best fiend is in like is he is he just actually
4602060	4605060	now that that Dino's here we can bring this up.
4605060	4607560	Yeah, so it actually kind of is like my best fiend sometimes
4607560	4610460	when he's around get really pissed off at him kind of
4610460	4614860	scream at him sometimes but can also be a really fun time
4614860	4617660	and we could do lots of great stuff together and you know,
4617660	4621360	he's just that kind of guy that gets a little out of bounds
4621360	4624660	unnecessarily and unknowingly.
4624660	4624960	Sorry.
4624960	4625260	Sorry.
4625260	4625660	Sorry.
4625660	4626160	Sorry.
4626160	4628160	I'm going to ask you a multiple choice question.
4629160	4634960	He did that because he's a crazy be mad at you.
4634960	4637860	See has a really terrible sense of humor.
4637860	4640760	I think he's actually calling me right D.
4640760	4644660	It was a bit they planned out like a some sad Andy Kaufman
4644660	4647660	as I'm actually I'm actually I actually think he's just like
4647660	4648160	pissed off.
4648160	4651160	I came on stage and then talked about Deadpool and was like,
4651160	4653460	oh, I can't talk about Deadpool because I don't know anything
4653460	4653960	about it.
4653960	4654360	All right.
4654360	4655860	That's why I punch people.
4656860	4661360	That's what I thought of when I saw myself on the ground.
4661360	4664260	I was like, I fucked up.
4664260	4665660	I didn't make him proud.
4665660	4666560	Sorry, dad.
4666560	4670860	That's so sad that that's where you defaulted to after being
4670860	4674260	attacked randomly by a friend.
4674260	4674760	Yeah.
4674760	4676960	Well, yeah, the attack was random.
4676960	4682060	The friend is known to be not not not to that extent, but
4682060	4685660	he's tackled you actually when he came to Supercon to those
4685660	4687760	2014 when you do your Q&A.
4687760	4689160	See, I knew there was a Supercon.
4689560	4691960	Yeah, he actually he has achieved quite a bit.
4693060	4696660	I actually stop a few times, but what do you remember a
4696660	4698160	specific so I can like place it?
4700160	4701660	He just said take off your shirt.
4701860	4703360	Lots of people tell me Tourette's.
4704460	4706260	He's actually the Tourette's guy also.
4706260	4706760	Oh, is he?
4706760	4707260	Yes.
4707760	4710160	So he was just fucking wasted probably, right?
4710660	4714460	We have been drinking some local beers something today.
4714460	4716260	So I guess he's probably more wasted than I was.
4716660	4719660	Those local beers like like bath salts lager.
4721760	4722960	Special K.
4724860	4725760	Anheuser.
4726660	4727860	No, it's all Flocka flavor.
4727860	4728460	That's what it is.
4728460	4729360	It's all Flocka.
4729660	4731960	Can I just say you're being an excellent sport?
4732460	4733560	Like I am impressed.
4734760	4737260	I'm actually really happy right now.
4737260	4738560	It was his best friend.
4740260	4744060	Yeah, but but but yes, I mean he's not being that good of
4744060	4745960	a sport is his friend.
4746160	4749360	They have a silly, terrible, unbalanced relationship.
4751060	4752960	He's a battered wife is what he is.
4754160	4755460	I'm not a very sport.
4755860	4758160	Is that what you call a battered wife Spencer?
4758260	4759960	You're such a good sport.
4759960	4760660	They are.
4761960	4763760	Do you think they're poor sports?
4764660	4766660	Are you going to give that to battered women?
4766660	4769660	They're also poor sports on top of everything else.
4770760	4772960	You guys are a race for the high road.
4772960	4776660	So you're gonna you're gonna hit the stratosphere and asphyxiate
4776660	4777160	each other.
4778260	4778560	All right.
4778560	4782660	Well, I'm is is is everyone else satisfied?
4782660	4783560	We can move on.
4784060	4785960	Yes, for God's sake.
4786460	4790260	Well, I didn't look I had my I wanted to know more.
4790260	4795660	I felt like you guys if I didn't help you investigate that
4795660	4798360	you'd be like, why isn't he talking about the thing with
4798360	4802660	the thing but I guess I'm getting a maybe not a clear picture
4802660	4804560	but I categorize it now.
4805160	4807160	Was he the guy that was videotaping?
4807560	4808360	I was someone else.
4808360	4809860	Okay, you guys are fine.
4809860	4810560	Don't worry about it.
4810960	4811560	All right.
4811660	4815860	Well, I guess maybe Deadpool will be a bad movie.
4816860	4817960	I guess at this point.
4817960	4819160	It's kind of looking at it.
4819960	4825860	If his fans react to criticism that way, I don't think it's
4825860	4828160	because it's a gonna be a great movie.
4829160	4833060	I liked on Golden Pond, but I never I let it do its own
4833060	4833760	defending.
4835860	4836960	I liked Hudson Hawk.
4838760	4840560	Did you really like on Golden Pond?
4840560	4841760	I wouldn't think you'd like that.
4841860	4843060	I thought it was kind of fun.
4843760	4845660	Nice like ordinary people.
4845660	4849160	I like those movies about like I got I got I got some movies
4849160	4849860	to show you on.
4849860	4850360	All right.

4867560	4869060	What's your favorite movie is a stupid question.
4869060	4870960	What is a favorite movie of yours?
4873660	4876060	Just randomly doesn't have to doesn't have to be like.
4880760	4881660	What I didn't hear.
4884560	4885660	It's also a bad movie.
4886960	4888160	Fuck god damn it.
4889560	4891360	You're a good sport with the punch, but you really over
4891360	4892560	indulge that wordplay.
4894060	4896260	That was that and I feel assaulted by that.
4898360	4899760	Fuck that guy sucker punch.
4901960	4903260	Just name a movie you like.
4904860	4905760	The hateful 8 was great.

4907760	4908160	Oh, yeah.
4908160	4909860	Okay, so we saw the ceramic dome.
4910160	4910960	Why am I yelling at you?

4936960	4938860	plug your band or anything.

4942260	4944160	He may get there in a band together.

5055860	5057460	I'm just glad it was him and not us.

5061460	5062060	Yeah, yeah.
5063060	5065660	That's why yeah, I'm pleasantly surprised.
5065660	5066160	Jesus Christ.
5066160	5070660	God damn it scared the shit out of me.
5071260	5073260	We all have fucking PTSD now.
5076060	5078660	That's I got I got I got the I got the living crap eaten
5078660	5079660	out of me when I was 17.
5079660	5082860	I I very I I won't say I deserved it.
5082860	5084160	Nobody deserves to be physically hurt.
5084160	5087060	But I mean, I I put myself in a situation where it shouldn't
5087060	5091960	have shocked me that that I that I ended up like like a
5091960	5092860	lot of trouble.
5092860	5097060	The I went and partied with a bunch of just random dudes
5097060	5100860	like in my in my in my hometown of Brown Deer, Wisconsin.
5100860	5104160	There was only like if you were underage, you couldn't buy
5104160	5105160	liquor at the liquor stores.
5105160	5108160	It's too small a town and we would just go to the motel
5108160	5112860	this like local motel and like we'd like see if anybody
5112860	5115660	wanted to like pitch in a bunch of money and find somebody
5115660	5118860	who was 21 and go buy beer as I went with a couple of friends
5118860	5121560	and was like cruising the motel and there was a bunch of dudes
5121560	5124260	and we started drinking malt liquor together and smoking
5124260	5125560	weed and we all pooled our money.
5125560	5128260	So we all knew we were all broke and then like we just get
5128260	5130060	really really high and really really drunk.
5130060	5132760	And then I'll that's the horrible thing about violence
5132760	5135660	is it's like inexplicable and it's like because it just makes
5135660	5138760	no sense and it just flavors your world for the rest of your
5138760	5141560	life because you're like what the fuck was that like I was
5141560	5143560	I just remember sitting and being really high and really
5143560	5146260	drunk and there's this rap music playing and like like
5146260	5146960	I'm just nodding.
5146960	5149960	I'm like I'm so high and I got a yin-yang patch on my frosted
5149960	5154160	denim jacket and I got a I got a little rat tail with rubber
5154160	5157660	bands and my little e-gun from the real Ghostbusters rat tail
5158760	5162560	and and then all of a sudden like one of my two friends like
5162560	5165660	I see him stand up and like there's like one of the stranger
5165660	5165960	guys.
5165960	5167160	They had us way outnumbered.
5167560	5169760	He was like talking to him and my friends start shaking his
5169760	5171560	head and I didn't know what was going on because the music
5171560	5172260	was so loud.
5172460	5174960	And then all of a sudden these like fists just start flying
5174960	5177060	like like like the guy was just like beating up my friend.
5177060	5178160	It wasn't like they got in the fight.
5178160	5180660	It was like the guy just started assaulting him and then I
5180660	5184060	stood up and then it was just like like like it was it was
5184060	5187360	like like 10 dudes like just like it felt like they were
5187360	5188460	trying to murder me.
5188460	5190860	Like I didn't feel like they were ever going to stop and
5190860	5192360	I remember like pulling out my wallet.
5192360	5194660	I was like kneeling on the floor and I helped out my wallet
5194660	5196960	which I knew was empty and which they knew was empty and
5196960	5200560	then I felt the wallet leave my hand and and there was a pause
5200560	5204560	and then I felt more of more punches in the back of my head
5204560	5206460	and then that's I thought oh my god, they're going to kill me
5206460	5208760	because like like there was no there's no reason for this.
5208760	5210160	They're just like so high and drunk.
5210160	5212860	They just want to fucking kill me and like there was like
5212860	5214760	glasses breaking over my head.
5214760	5217560	It was like my head was going into like mirrors and stuff a
5217560	5217960	mirror.
5218160	5219860	I pluralized it to sound like a badass.
5220360	5221660	You were in a house of mirrors.
5221660	5224060	There was like I must I probably told the story of the podcast
5224060	5226560	before there's like there was a kid like tossed around the
5226560	5230060	room and like I at one point one guy in the corner from their
5230060	5233860	crew like grabbed me that was standing by the door and he
5233860	5236060	just grabbed me by the shoulders and looked at my eyes and
5236060	5239960	said get out of here and shoved me out the door and slammed it
5239960	5246160	behind me and locked it like I wanted to get back in and I
5246160	5248260	am ashamed to say I forgot about my friends.
5248260	5251760	I didn't know if they were gone because I was so I didn't I
5251760	5254260	wasn't I didn't remember if they were still in there,
5254260	5258560	but I just want to be candid and say I didn't think about
5258560	5259160	them anymore.
5259160	5262560	I wasn't that I was up my my face was so fucked up.
5262760	5265360	It was rapidly like the swelling starts to happen a little
5265360	5265760	bit later.
5265760	5267560	That's like it was everything was getting blurry.
5267860	5270360	The last thing I saw clearly before everything just became
5270360	5274460	blobs of light was a young lady coming out of an adjacent
5274460	5278860	motel room and it was the it was the this was the worst part
5278860	5282860	of it all was that I she came out of the room and she looked
5282860	5285960	at me and I just expected like well, I've been the victim
5285960	5288660	of a violent crime and now here's where somebody will
5288660	5295260	express the concern because and she whatever she saw which
5295260	5297460	are the only mirror available to me and my face had gone
5297460	5300860	through so I didn't know what she she she she looked at me
5300860	5305360	and she she screamed like like she like she was terrified
5305360	5306060	of me.
5306060	5309060	That's how fucked up my face look like she she was just
5309060	5312560	like like watching and she ran back into her room and just
5312560	5314760	like like close the close the door and then I just like
5314760	5318160	walked and I tumbled down a hill onto a freeway and I and
5318160	5320960	that bad note and I stood up and I tried to walk home,
5320960	5322660	but I couldn't see I just like walked.
5322960	5325060	I was just following like these lights because I couldn't
5325060	5325660	see anything.
5326960	5329760	Why did I bring that up because that sound and fucking meaty
5329760	5333160	slap I got I got in high school.
5333560	5336760	I got beat up once it was it was supposed to be a fight,
5337360	5341560	but it wasn't I didn't throw a punch because I just didn't
5341560	5345660	know I just it seemed weird to punch someone back in high
5345660	5351760	school now, but but I remember I just got like the shit beat
5351760	5354960	out of me and and just like, you know, like black eye and blood
5354960	5358460	and and I remember the guy and he's my Facebook friend now
5359560	5365360	and and then I posted this bit that I do with Andy Dick where
5365360	5371160	he beats the shit out of me as a bit and I post it once a year
5371160	5372160	because it hurts.
5372260	5374560	So I feel like I should at least get credit for getting punched
5374560	5382160	in the face and slapped really hard and one of the comments
5382160	5388060	was that guy's brother who just wrote his brother's name Sal
5388560	5391260	and it was highlighted like you got to take a look at this
5391960	5396660	like the guy that you fucking beat up is now on YouTube
5396660	5397460	getting beat up.
5398360	5398860	I don't know.
5398860	5401460	I mean, or do you think I'm just like reading into some?
5401460	5403160	No, no, I don't at all.
5403160	5406960	Well, how did that make you feel? Horrible like like he's
5406960	5410560	this guy is still like talking about right beating the shit
5410560	5411960	out of me when I was 13.
5413860	5417260	I and also made me feel good because you know, I mean, he's
5417260	5418260	got no life.
5419960	5420760	That's a high point.
5420760	5422260	It is like pee pee pee.
5422260	5424660	You bet your butt because it yeah, you don't want to be his
5424660	5426660	peak. Yeah, exactly.
5427260	5431360	Jack's off about if he won a contest after that and that
5431360	5433060	was his peak that he really mock him.
5434860	5435360	All right.
5435360	5437260	Well moving on from that that topic.

5640360	5643360	This one's by Michael Bricks a lot of people wrote recaps
5643360	5645660	and they were very good, but a lot of them were too long.
5645660	5646260	Sorry.
5646860	5647760	Okay, so yeah.
5649360	5653360	Last time on Harmon run the gang made their way to press 5
5653360	5657960	to refresh in search of Jim Peggy's daughter in an attempt
5657960	5659360	to complete their mission.
5659360	5663360	All but Hortigard disguised themselves as Southern bells to
5663360	5665260	sneak their way into the building.
5665460	5669760	They got to the lobby but in an unlikely array of events Jim
5669760	5673260	grew impatient of Rob Schwab and shot the security guard in
5673260	5673960	the head.
5674660	5678260	That's right after debating whether or not they should heal
5678260	5682560	the dead man a smoke grenade flew into the room and gunfire
5682560	5686860	started a blazing through poorly trying to escape through
5686860	5687660	an air vent.
5687660	5690860	Rob Schwab runs towards the security guards.
5690960	5694460	Oh, I guess that's Mercy O'Donnell Mercy O'Donnell runs
5694460	5698060	towards the security guards and is obliterated into a pink
5698060	5700460	mist by a machine gun fire.
5700860	5703360	Is this the end of our shadow runners?
5703460	5707260	Well, they meet the same fate as Mercy O'Donnell and who was
5707260	5710360	Rob Schwab playing as I answered that question.
5710660	5716260	Find out this time on Shadow Town Harmon run town.
5718260	5718760	All right.
5720760	5721260	All right.
5721360	5722860	Do you guys have any questions?
5722860	5724460	Let me set the stage for you.
5724660	5729160	You're in the lobby of the press F5 to refresh their security
5729160	5732460	guards peppering the area with machine gun fire.
5732560	5736360	Everyone is clambering into an air vent except for Jim
5736360	5738760	Nightblade who's just finishing his climbing.
5738860	5742460	You're all in this air vent that's being or the air vents
5742460	5743260	above a room.
5743260	5745160	That's just being coated in gunfire.
5745160	5747960	You hear screams and just explosions and all sorts of
5747960	5750860	stuff and you realize the air vent you're in isn't exactly
5750860	5751760	bulletproof.
5752960	5754260	Is the air conditioning on?
5754360	5755660	Yeah, it's it's lovely.
5757260	5758360	Guys, I see here.
5758360	5759660	I'm good at sneaking.
5760360	5766160	So can I suggest not being loud in this air vent?
5766960	5767560	Okay.
5768860	5770360	How many points do I get for that?
5770360	5770760	Three.
5771160	5771760	Thank you.
5771860	5775060	Yeah, I think they might blow you out of the water.
5776060	5777360	Just keep moving.
5777360	5777660	Who's it?
5777660	5777960	Who's it?
5777960	5780060	So we're all single file in an air vent.
5780060	5781860	Yeah, you're kind of in the back.
5782860	5783860	Go go.
5784360	5785660	I think they know we're in here.
5786860	5788160	What I say about quiet.
5788960	5791960	Don't talk just mind if we could be both quiet and fast.
5791960	5792260	Good.
5792260	5795460	But if one has to cost the other I'd go for speed because
5795560	5797160	bullets are so fast.
5800460	5805060	But I'm good at medicine so I can heal you who's in front.
5806160	5807460	Let's say Mercy.
5807460	5808360	No, she's dead.
5809560	5811260	Let's put Horda guard out front.
5811560	5812160	Okay.
5812260	5813060	Is that me?
5813060	5814260	No, I'll lead the way.
5815160	5816260	I move very quickly.
5816560	5817160	It's true.
5817160	5818860	He's got follow him.
5819360	5823260	Okay, you crawl down the vent as bullet holes rip through
5823260	5824260	the air vent.
5824460	5824960	Don't worry.
5824960	5825860	I'm good at medicine.
5825860	5826660	I dodge them.
5827460	5830960	I use my cat like agility to sneak around those bullets.
5831060	5831860	You do that.
5831860	5834060	You sneak right around the bullets.
5835660	5838660	You guys crawl to a T-junction in the air vent.
5838660	5840360	It seems to be past the room.
5840360	5843360	You were just in so you bought yourselves a little bit of
5843360	5845360	time left.
5848460	5849060	Is that it?
5850160	5852660	Does it seem like a correct direction?
5853260	5855260	They all seem great left.
5855660	5857160	Yeah, you turn left.
5857560	5858960	You shuffle down.
5859060	5860760	We all I follow for my money.
5862060	5863760	You shuffle down below you.
5863760	5866460	You see a great but also the thing goes ahead.
5866460	5869660	It's like still being a ducked that way, but there's a great
5869660	5870460	below you.
5872560	5876460	Great geography jump down through it.
5876660	5877360	All right.
5879560	5880860	I look through it first.
5880960	5884660	You see a bunch of cowering you see a bunch of cowering people
5884660	5884960	there.
5884960	5888460	They're wearing a what do you call those medical gowns and
5888460	5892460	they're cowering as if evading or trying to dodge some sort
5892460	5893160	of shooting.
5894760	5896660	Is there anyone shooting at them?
5896660	5900860	No, but you do hear gunshots coming from other rooms like
5900860	5902060	the ones who were just near.
5902060	5905860	All right, so I kicked my way through it and take a defensive
5906160	5906860	position.
5907260	5908960	All right, who else is doing stuff?
5908960	5912460	I shoot like five people.
5913960	5915560	Who else is doing stuff?
5916360	5917760	Because I'm good at shooting.
5918060	5918560	It's true.
5918560	5919260	He's great.
5919260	5924860	I dropped down.
5924860	5929160	I mean, if you want to figure out the result of him shooting
5929160	5931860	five people, it's all gonna happen kind of simultaneous.
5931860	5932060	Okay.
5932060	5935960	Well, I was gonna I mean, if I'm my next move would be to go
5935960	5938060	down into the room that he went down into.
5938060	5938560	All right.
5938560	5941860	So oh, I didn't get to catch your name.
5942260	5942860	Dan Harmon.
5942860	5944360	No, oh, William.
5945760	5946960	That'd be so sad.
5947060	5947560	Caitlin.
5947560	5948460	What do you want to do?
5949260	5952360	I'm gonna follow behind them still being Catholic.
5952560	5953160	All right.
5953160	5955160	The three of you leap into the room.
5955160	5958160	It shocks all the people and they start backing away from
5958160	5958360	you.
5958360	5961560	But as they back away, five of them are cut down by pistol
5961560	5964160	fire coming from the vent above me, right?
5964160	5964660	Yeah.
5967160	5968360	Jesus Christ.
5968760	5969060	All right.
5969060	5971060	All right, get their medical gowns.
5972460	5977360	They'll never they'll never suspect five doctors with blood
5977360	5978060	all over them.
5978060	5979360	I stripped the dead ones.
5979760	5981560	What I stripped the dead ones.
5981560	5982060	Okay.
5982560	5986060	The rest of them are screaming and cowering in a corner.
5986360	5988960	I give me your medical gowns.
5992760	5997060	People got shot even before I asked that I know I jump down
5997060	6001260	and and apply medicine to the shot people and get them to
6001260	6002160	be on our side.
6002160	6002960	Well, they're dead.
6002960	6004060	The shot people are dead.
6004060	6007160	No, I'm really good at medicine, but you're even you're
6007160	6008360	better at shooting though.
6008360	6011260	Well, that's not true, but you were good enough at shooting
6011260	6014760	so that the goodness of medicine is an applicable in this
6014760	6015560	situation.
6016160	6020360	You're the you're the you're the Dragon Lord grand mask.
6020360	6021460	No Grand Dragon.
6022860	6023160	Yeah.
6023160	6026960	Well, I got somebody give me your give me your gowns.
6027060	6029060	You got you got everybody's gowns.

6029260	6031960	I put I put put these on we're going to walk out of here
6031960	6032960	disguised as doctors.
6032960	6034260	It's the best plan in the world.
6034260	6036460	Medical gowns are not worn by doctors.
6036960	6038660	Oh patience patience.
6039860	6040760	That's even better.
6041660	6043660	Am I still in the grading up there?
6044060	6044460	Yeah.
6044460	6045460	Yeah, you're still up there.
6045460	6047060	Hey guys.
6047060	6055860	Yeah, I'm really good with clubs.
6055960	6060860	I was in the chess club in school and I think we should move
6061960	6065560	like the way a knight moves like like like like straight
6065560	6066560	and then to the side.
6066660	6067460	Is that a knight?
6067560	6068060	Oh shit.
6068060	6069460	I think I'm thinking Bishop.
6069660	6072260	Yeah, no wonder I got kicked out of that club.
6072260	6077860	Yeah, why don't you do what a pawn would do and just come
6077860	6081960	down one space you okay, do what a pawn would do.
6081960	6083160	You're an asshole.
6084260	6085060	Sorry.
6085060	6085960	I think you're a queen.
6088160	6090260	You I like what do you want?
6090860	6091260	All right.
6093260	6094060	Queens could do anything.
6094060	6097260	Please get to what pawns do right or is that a king?
6097660	6099160	I'm putting out a gown.
6100460	6101460	Do I have a gown on?
6101460	6102760	Yeah, I'm leaving.
6102860	6103460	Okay.
6103760	6107260	Do you take off all your tactical gear or do you disarm yourself
6107260	6110660	or gown it kind of like drapes over the gear and it's very
6110660	6114960	thin and also open now realism.
6117060	6117560	All right.
6117560	6118160	All right.
6119260	6119860	Okay.
6119860	6121460	I just want to get the lay of the land.
6121860	6125060	I take off all of my tactical gear and I yeah, I do it.
6125060	6125960	I'm a desperate man.
6125960	6126760	I'm terrified.
6126760	6131260	This mission has gone parashaped since about a year
6131260	6136560	and a half ago and I now if I could just in my head, what
6136560	6140760	I'm thinking just so you know is if I have to get naked put
6140760	6144660	on a medical gown and wander off into Seattle and just never
6144660	6145660	shadow run again.
6145660	6149160	I right now I'm like thinking like the good idea because I'm
6149160	6151360	just I've just I feel bad.
6151460	6152160	All right.
6152260	6153260	I got an idea.
6155860	6156960	Let's play dead.
6157260	6158660	I have this cyanide.
6158760	6161160	We all take the cyanide and play dead.
6161860	6164060	We all have cyanide immunity, right?
6165360	6167160	We have cyanide community.
6168560	6169160	I do.
6169160	6170560	Do you guys have cyanide immunity?
6170560	6171160	No.
6171960	6172560	New plan.
6172560	6173160	New plan.
6174260	6177560	You can take your cyanide if you take your cyanide.
6177560	6178960	I can quick heal you.
6179160	6179860	Yes.
6180060	6180960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6180960	6181960	And where does that get us?
6182260	6183160	Nowhere.
6184260	6185360	You lose cyanide.
6185660	6186660	Yeah, because I'm immune to it.
6186660	6187160	Anyway.
6187960	6188660	All right, go ahead.
6188660	6189160	Go ahead.
6189760	6190760	Oh, immunity.
6190760	6191660	I thought you were okay.
6192260	6194860	I'm putting I'm getting naked and putting on this gown.
6195360	6197260	Yeah, and then I'm leaving.
6199760	6200660	I'll follow you.
6200760	6201260	Okay.
6202260	6203860	Can you get naked and put on a gown?
6204760	6205260	Yeah.
6206660	6207560	Yeah, I love it.
6209360	6210060	Here we go.
6211060	6212060	Are you still up in the vents?
6212060	6213060	Get a load of this.
6214660	6215160	Yeah.
6215360	6217960	You've just been this voice from a vent this whole time.
6219460	6222360	I like you to see me in little squares naked.
6223060	6223660	Here I am.
6223660	6224160	Okay.
6224160	6226460	I'm out of the vent and I'm all dressed.
6226660	6227260	All right.
6227560	6229360	Two of you are wearing medical gowns.
6230560	6231760	Are we still being attacked?
6231860	6233560	No, you're in another room.
6233760	6234060	Okay.
6235060	6245060	I strap a grappling hook to my arm under the sleeve and two
6245060	6250760	guns to my back like a die-hard like a double die-hard like
6250760	6253160	a double die-hard with a side of grappling hook.
6253860	6258160	I'm going to die harder and then I'll wear the gown and stuff
6258160	6259160	my clothes into the vent.
6259360	6259860	All right.
6260360	6263160	You hear an explosion coming from the hallway.
6263160	6267560	You see a metal door fly going face down and you hear the
6267560	6271960	voices of tactical people going clear the hole, get every
6271960	6274360	room, get them all, find all the peeps.
6276160	6277260	It's future slang.
6278460	6281160	Caitlin, whoever you're playing, who are you playing?
6281760	6282260	Eve.
6284260	6285460	Get naked.
6285960	6287660	Oh, yes, I strip down.
6287660	6290860	I put on my medical gown and then I want to use my improved
6290860	6293560	invisibility so these people that are charging in this room
6293560	6294460	are about to find me.
6294460	6297260	Oh, well, you know, just so you know, now I feel bad that I
6297260	6297960	told you to get naked.
6297960	6301760	If you have invisibility, I and I feel like I should mention
6301760	6304760	that improved invisibility can work on multiple targets.
6304960	6305360	All right.
6305360	6309960	Well, I cast my improved invisibility on all of us.
6309960	6310560	Jesus Christ.
6310560	6316860	I put my tactical gear back on except now it's hard because
6316860	6318260	I can't see my own hands.
6318960	6322360	So it's kind of like it's like when you have novocaine in your
6322360	6324360	jaw and you're trying to suck through a straw.
6324460	6326760	I put my hospital gun on backwards.
6329860	6332860	All right, so okay, you're all invisible.
6332860	6335560	Do you have a course of action or do you think being invisible
6335560	6336160	is good?
6336960	6339360	Well, I mean, let's be honest, being invisible is great.
6340460	6341760	Yeah, this is enough.
6341960	6343360	It solves a ton of problems.
6343360	6343860	All right.
6344760	6346060	I'm going to tactical guardsman.
6346060	6348760	They rush into the room and they go where that where are
6348760	6349960	they going to get on the ground?
6349960	6350660	Get on the ground.
6350660	6353560	You see all the people get on the ground and they start crying
6353760	6356760	and two of the guardsmen stay watching the rest of them run
6356760	6359860	down the hall to clear other other rooms.
6360960	6362960	I silently walk out.
6363760	6364760	Okay, the door.
6365360	6366060	Ow.
6367560	6369460	Sorry, a bird just flew into my head.
6371160	6372460	We're indoors.
6373460	6374960	It was a parakeet.
6376560	6379960	I hate being invisible.
6381660	6383360	I shit.
6384660	6389760	I attack the I stun baton the the guards that are in here
6389760	6394260	the tactical guys because they hear us talking now, right?
6394960	6395260	Yeah.
6395260	6395460	Yeah.
6395460	6396160	No, they do.
6396160	6397360	Am I going to turn visible?
6397360	6398660	Is this like D&D rules?
6398660	6400360	Do I turn visible when I attack?
6401060	6401860	I can't remember.
6401960	6402760	Let's say yes.
6402760	6403260	Okay.
6403760	6404260	Okay.
6404360	6405360	Well, then I don't attack.
6406160	6407460	Can I make walls?
6407960	6408160	Right.
6408160	6409060	I'm the wall maker.
6409060	6411360	You're I don't think Hordegregg can make walls.
6411860	6413860	Any human being can make walls.
6414360	6415560	I stand corrected.
6416360	6416560	Yeah.
6416560	6416960	Dr.
6416960	6417760	Frank can make barriers.
6417760	6419060	I think Eve can make barriers.
6419060	6422760	I know how to make everything but I have social anxiety when
6422760	6427360	I talk to people and I can't I can't explain the door behind
6427360	6427660	us.
6427660	6429860	I can make barriers a second page here.
6431460	6433660	Well, am I going to make me not invisible anymore?
6433660	6434360	That's true.
6434560	6434760	Yeah.
6434760	6435960	I'm leaving.
6435960	6436660	All right.
6436760	6438060	Do you want to tell anyone that?
6438160	6439760	Can I do it through my comm links?
6439760	6441660	Yeah, like a telepathic way?
6441660	6442360	Well, you have.
6442360	6442660	Yeah.
6442660	6445160	I mean, there's these those are the short answers.
6445160	6446460	Yes, I'm leaving.

6451960	6453760	Tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet.
6453760	6456260	I'm leaving fucking parakeet.
6460160	6462060	All right, silently and invisibly.
6462060	6464260	You walk out the front door.
6465060	6465860	Of the whole place.
6465860	6466160	Yeah.
6466160	6467060	We're out in the streets.
6467060	6467560	Yeah, man.
6467560	6469760	All right, guys, we did it.
6469760	6470360	You did.
6470360	6471260	We made it out alive.
6471260	6471860	Not tired.
6473260	6473960	All right.
6479460	6481260	You really didn't die.
6483860	6488360	Guys, how can we see anything because you need when you're
6488360	6492660	invisible, you need to focus your on your retina and like,
6492660	6493660	how do you focus?
6493660	6497860	If the light is going through your ocular apparatus.
6497860	6500060	Yeah, it's a good question.
6500060	6503360	Yeah, we should we should we should go to the library.
6504760	6505860	Let's go to the library.
6506460	6507560	We go to the library.
6507660	6508160	Okay.
6509560	6511260	Maybe we weren't really invisible.
6512460	6513060	No, you are.
6513060	6513860	Maybe it's impossible.
6513860	6514960	We're going to the library.
6514960	6516260	Why do you hate libraries?
6517560	6518660	Learn a few things.
6518660	6520160	You're illiterate, aren't you?
6521160	6523260	I don't have your sheet, but I think you're illiterate.
6523760	6524560	I've got a map.
6525760	6526660	He's got it.
6527760	6528260	All right.

6557660	6559760	Oh, that explains everything.
6561860	6563060	You can't see me yet.
6563860	6564460	No.

6577560	6578160	Okay.
6579060	6579460	All right.
6579460	6580260	I'm out in the street.
6581060	6583160	We had Spencer trying to figure this out.
6583160	6585860	It's not my job to figure this out at all.
6586060	6588160	No, I mean, you just walked out of the mission.
6588160	6589060	What do you want to do now?
6589060	6590560	It turns out that you do.
6590560	6591660	Are you mad at us?
6592460	6594160	I mean, I knew this was going to happen.
6595960	6596260	All right.
6596260	6597060	We failed.
6597260	6597760	We fail.

6600560	6605360	My ex-wife's character got got blown away in a mist and she's
6605360	6607360	going to think that I put Spencer up to that.
6607360	6611760	All right.
6611760	6614660	Well, we all jump up in the air, even though we can't see
6614660	6620160	each other, but in the bad high fives, right?
6620360	6620760	Yeah.
6620760	6622060	A lot of bad high fives anywhere.
6622060	6624460	It's like a freeze frame, like in a Toyota commercial from
6624460	6629660	the 80s, but we don't know it when we just all describe it.
6629660	6630760	I'm up in the air.

6657960	6658660	I think he got it.
6658660	6661960	He took a punch like a man or a strong woman.
