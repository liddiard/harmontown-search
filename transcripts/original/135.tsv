0	18920	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harman Town is now in session.
18920	25920	Please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
25920	37800	Thank you very much.
37800	38800	Bad show tonight.
38800	39800	Bad show.
39800	41680	Just not feeling it.
41680	43560	Yesterday was Valentine's Day.
43560	51320	I'm not at liberty to say whether or not I use recreational drugs, but if they're in
51320	57360	a hypothetical universe where there was one that facilitated intimate coupling.
57360	61480	Maybe some sort of ecstatic sensations.
61480	66160	Something that would have been prescribed to couples before it was illegalized back
66160	68440	in the 80s, I think.
68440	73160	I would have probably taken that yesterday and I would be having a serotonin depletion
73160	79040	right now with just pleasant memories of seeing Wicked at the Pantages.
79040	80040	You went?
80040	81040	How was it?
81040	82040	It was good.
82040	83040	Are you a big musical theater guy?
83040	84040	Do you enjoy it?
84040	85040	I like a good musical.
85040	86040	Yeah.
86040	87040	I mean, I don't like a bad one.
87040	88040	No one does.
88040	91800	I don't know what that makes me, a regular old musical consumer.
91800	96040	I used to go, yeah, when I was a kid, we went to every play at the Pantages.
96040	101560	That's a very, very fond childhood kind of memory for me.
101560	107440	It's about a witch.
107440	109440	She the protagonist of the tale?
109440	110440	Yeah.
110440	111440	Even though she's a witch.
111440	114880	We'll do a little reversal there.
114880	120760	Were you theoretically on this ecstatic sort of possible thing during the show?
120760	121760	Oh, yeah.
121760	122760	Yeah.
122760	123760	Yeah.
123760	124760	Oh, that's great.
124760	125760	I don't know why.
125760	126760	I mean, that was...
126760	129960	I'm especially not allowed to talk about the possibility of my wife going near this stuff,
129960	137800	but if she had, I would have said to her, would you really want to do that during this?
137800	142840	And she would have said yes, but we didn't.
142840	148080	But if I had, then I would have been sitting there with my eyeballs kind of going...
148080	153160	Do you think that would possibly have enhanced your wicked viewing pleasure, or was it distracting
153160	155960	hypothetically?
155960	156960	It's a synthetic drug.
156960	163680	I think you kind of, if you take mushrooms or acid, not that I ever have, but if you...
163680	167360	Those change your experience, like your perception of things.
167360	178320	I think that my experience with the ecstasy family of drugs, it's a very small family.
178320	183520	I think it's just that guy in Molly, in front of Molly, right?
184520	189880	It kind of puts you in a certain mood, but everything that's happening around you, you're
189880	195000	emotionally receiving it differently, but you're not experiencing anything other than
195000	196240	what's actually happening.
196240	200920	So I guess I was kind of like, this musical puts me in a great mood.
200920	203480	Which may not be true, but I don't know.
203480	204480	Maybe it was bad.
204480	205480	I don't know.
205480	206480	It seemed good to me.
206480	207480	She was green.
207480	208480	She flew.
209480	214080	Don't let this guy tell you whether or not I had a good time yesterday.
214080	216080	It'll sound terrible.
216080	219080	This is what happens.
219080	223840	This is the price you pay for your disco drugs.
223840	225880	All those highs you kids are on.
225880	227480	They have lows.
230480	233360	Yeah, I'm rotten as a fucking chop today, man.
233360	237480	I apparently drank 100,000 drinks in Anacortes, Washington yesterday.
237480	242040	I was telling Dan backstage, I was on a plane, and I had to go into the lavatory just to
242040	243040	get it together.
243040	247240	I just sat and they're like, it was really nice in there, too.
247240	250320	I was like, I can't be around human beings right now.
250320	254480	That's called delirium tremendous, I believe is the word.
254480	255480	It's not good.
255480	256480	Yeah.
260480	264480	Well, good news is I guess I'm bored with the black people now.
265480	268480	I think we kind of...
268480	270480	You got that out of your system?
270480	271480	Yeah.
271480	273480	We really double dipped last time, too.
273480	279480	I didn't mean for that to happen, but I wanted anybody that did come just for the asking
279480	280480	to be rewarded for it, for sure.
280480	283480	I don't know if either of those two guys, Brian and Max, if they actually...
283480	286480	It sounded like they had those coincidence that they were here.
286480	289480	There were other people tweeting me going, I'm going to come to the show because I'm
289480	290480	black and you asked for it.
290480	294480	And I thought, if they do that, then that's very sacrificial of them.
294480	298480	They should be given a reward of some kind, a spotlight, for instance.
298480	304480	But they're having their race acknowledged and having them be dehumanized through it.
304480	306480	Anatolia, are you having a weird psychotic episode over here?
306480	307480	What's going on?
307480	308480	I don't know.
308480	310480	He's got a...
310480	313480	Can we get a camera on this guy?
313480	314480	What is happening?
314480	316480	Anatolia, do you want to...
316480	317480	I mean, you kind of have to.
317480	320480	Normally we ask if you want to, but if you're going to sit in the front room and do that,
320480	323480	you have to show people what you're doing.
323480	326480	At least stand up and face the audience and give them what I'm getting here.
326480	330480	This is very horrifying.
330480	333480	Completely nightmare inducing.
340480	342480	How are you?
342480	343480	Oh, boy.
343480	346480	Oh, no.
347480	348480	Careful.
348480	349480	Oh, boy.
349480	350480	Oh, no.
350480	352480	I thought you were going to fall.
352480	355480	Do you want to talk for a little bit?
355480	356480	Okay.
356480	362480	Why don't you have a seat over there?
362480	364480	I'm enjoying the sweater of this space kitten.
364480	365480	I love that.
365480	366480	Wow.
366480	367480	Yeah.
367480	370480	And it's got those earbud laces.
370480	371480	Yeah.
371480	372480	And I can do it like...
372480	374480	I can't listen to the music.
374480	376480	And it goes right to my nipples.
376480	377480	All right.
377480	380480	So the cat is listening and so are your nipples.
380480	385480	Have you heard of these bone-shaking headphones?
385480	390480	They use your bone, your skull to conduct the music.
390480	392480	So there's no actual sound happening.
392480	395480	It's just using your skull as a speaker.
395480	397480	That makes sense.
397480	400480	At least for me.
400480	401480	Yeah.
401480	404480	You look like you could use some disruption.
404480	408480	I mean, I just hear music constantly, every time.
408480	411480	Obviously, we're not going to ask, what are you doing?
411480	412480	Why are you doing that?
412480	414480	Because that's what you want us to do.
414480	416480	And then you'll be like, I don't know.
416480	425480	And here's your medal for whatever this movement is.
425480	430480	I'm not going to play the role of your father shooting you looks
430480	431480	over the top of my newspaper.
431480	436480	Well, I'm going to support you.
436480	438480	Like one of those dads.
438480	444480	The dads that you end up calling by his first name when you move out.
444480	445480	Yeah, that's good.
445480	446480	That's good.
446480	456480	So have you been directing anything lately?
456480	458480	I know you came out here to direct.
458480	459480	Yeah.
459480	463480	I'm kind of trying to make my desert film right now.
463480	465480	My desert short.
465480	466480	Your desert shield?
466480	467480	No.
467480	468480	This doesn't sound like that.
468480	469480	Desert short.
469480	470480	My final short in my program.
470480	471480	Oh, your final.
471480	472480	Your short.
472480	473480	Yeah, short film.
473480	474480	Yeah.
474480	476480	Are you talented enough to justify this level of eccentricity?
476480	477480	Yeah.
477480	479480	I mean, I'm pretty sure I am.
479480	480480	Yeah.
480480	481480	Okay.
481480	484480	One would hope that you can back that up.
484480	492480	You can't just start wearing kitten costumes and stuff.
492480	496480	I mean, well, I mean, yeah, yeah, you got to get, you got to go, you got to go.
496480	497480	Nevermind.
497480	502480	I mean, yeah, okay.
502480	503480	So, so, okay.
503480	504480	So what's your short about?
504480	506480	Can you tell us?
506480	510480	It's called about love, but it's not about love.
510480	511480	Nice.
511480	513480	What's it about?
513480	519480	It's just like a, like shots of a factory.
519480	527480	And then a, and then a razor blade on a coffee table as a tea kettle whistles
527480	533480	about love.
533480	534480	What's happening right now?
534480	535480	What's happening?
535480	536480	That's all it took in the seventies.
536480	539480	You're, you're, you're working for Spielberg after that.
539480	544480	Well, like, for real, for real.
544480	547480	Is the seventies right now?
547480	551480	Are you on anything or?
551480	554480	Oh, I mean, oh, fuck.
554480	556480	It's a safe place to tell us.
556480	557480	Yeah.
557480	558480	Yeah.
558480	559480	Yeah.
559480	560480	No.
560480	561480	Okay.
561480	563480	I mean, yeah.
563480	564480	Yeah.
564480	566480	I'm never on anything.
566480	567480	All right.
567480	569480	It's just cost a lot of money to be on something.
569480	571480	So I don't do it.
571480	572480	Yeah.
572480	573480	Yeah.
573480	575480	So the thing keeping you from being a drug addict is, is the financial aspect?
575480	580480	Yeah, because I mean, that's how, I mean, that's like my main problem because
580480	587480	as I see it, you always have risk of becoming like heavily addicted to it.
587480	591480	And then you need a lot of money for rehabs and stuff.
591480	593480	So I don't, I don't start with it.
593480	602480	Because when you have no money and start drugs, it's like, like your future is not
602480	605480	bright, might be not bright.
605480	613480	So I just kind of want to get some money first and then start with drugs.
613480	614480	It's good.
614480	615480	It's good thinking.
615480	616480	Yeah.
616480	619480	So you're, so you're in the meantime, you're just drinking.
619480	620480	I don't drink.
620480	622480	Do you have an inner ear infection?
622480	627480	It must be some explanation.
627480	630480	You seem a little wobbly and eccentric.
630480	632480	I'm just, I'm just an artist.
632480	633480	Oh, okay.
633480	634480	All right.
634480	635480	Okay.
635480	636480	I won't, I won't keep pushing it then.
636480	637480	Okay.
637480	643480	You're just, you're just a wobbly, dizzy magazine page wearing sober Russian.
643480	648480	It's like, like, yeah, it's like my entire life is my art project.
649480	650480	And like that.
650480	656480	And it goes from, yeah, and it doesn't mean anything, at least for me, but it might mean
656480	664480	something for people around and they will see me in my art and that's how art exists.
664480	665480	Oh, that's good.
665480	669480	Can we start a fun to get you really high for next week?
669480	674480	I wanted to see, because when we checked in with you, when we met you, you said you were,
674480	678480	you came out here to be a director and we tried to have you direct us.
678480	679480	Yeah.
679480	682480	And you just told us, talk louder or something?
682480	683480	No.
683480	684480	A lot of costume notes.
684480	689480	Yeah, I mean, but because it's most important to think like in, at least in film directing,
689480	694480	like if it's, if it's going on camera, it should look real.
694480	701480	You should be, if I remember correctly, you, it was a scene from a madman and you were
701480	704480	on Draper and you were dressed like you.
704480	705480	Right.
705480	711480	And, and, and, and like if on an episode of a madman, Don Draper would dress like that.
711480	712480	Right.
712480	713480	It won't be a madman.
713480	715480	So it's just, it's, it's for real.
715480	717480	It's, it's the first note.
717480	718480	Right.
718480	719480	Right.
719480	723480	I mean, if you're a crew of one, then you are also the wardrobe supervisor.
723480	724480	Yeah.
724480	728480	You should, like, all right.
729480	733480	Well, so you, so until we get you like a 200 person crew, we'll never get like a taste
733480	736480	of your like directing.
736480	739480	We can't like, as I wanted to see how far you've come as a director and that you've
739480	740480	been going to film school all this time.
740480	741480	Yeah.
741480	742480	I'm pretty far.
742480	743480	Yeah.
743480	746480	I mean, if Jeff and I were to do another scene for madman, did you get beyond our wardrobe?
746480	747480	Okay.
747480	748480	Okay.
748480	749480	I'll pretend like you're dressed fine.
749480	750480	Yeah.
750480	751480	Okay.
751480	752480	All right.
752480	758480	John Draper is coming into Peggy's office.
761480	767480	Oh, hello, Don.
767480	770480	What's going on with that Heinz report?
770480	772480	I was going to have it on your desk.
772480	773480	I just got distracted.
773480	776480	My husband has been not even having problems at home.
776480	778480	Can I make a few things perfectly clear?
778480	782480	It's not going to be one of those sexist monologues you go into, is it?
782480	791480	There's two things you're good for around here.
791480	795480	The Heinz account and the Heinz account.
795480	798480	I said it twice because it's twice as important.
798480	802480	This whole firm relies on the Heinz account.
802480	805480	I don't watch madmen.
805480	806480	Thank you.
807480	808480	I noticed that.
808480	809480	All right.
809480	812480	So you have some notes.
812480	817480	By the way, this is now just starting to seem natural, this whole thing now, isn't it?
817480	818480	Yeah.
818480	819480	Now we're strangely all okay with this.
819480	820480	Yeah.
820480	821480	I mean, yeah.
821480	823480	I mean, the main note is you should watch madmen.
823480	824480	Oh, okay.
824480	825480	All right.
825480	826480	Okay.
826480	827480	All right.
827480	828480	Well, okay.
828480	829480	I mean, so.
829480	830480	So.
830480	831480	Oh, my God.
831480	832480	Should we try?
832480	834480	Could we do like a Russian film?
835480	837480	Could we do like some kind of like artistic?
837480	838480	Solaris?
838480	839480	Solaris?
839480	840480	Sal Solaris.
840480	841480	Sal Solaris.
841480	842480	Yeah.
842480	843480	Tarkovsky's movie.
843480	844480	Tarkovsky's, yeah.
844480	845480	Tarkovsky.
845480	846480	Yeah.
846480	847480	About space and shit.
847480	851480	Can we do a Tarkovsky in space movie?
851480	854480	Well, can I predict his first note?
854480	856480	Will he be in space?
856480	857480	Yeah.
857480	860480	This seems like a lot of convenience.
861480	863480	I mean, I put this work in, and then he's like,
863480	866480	oh, come back when you're in space.
868480	869480	Then I direct.
872480	873480	I don't know.
873480	874480	I'm getting offended.
874480	875480	Get offended by it.
875480	878480	We exposed ourselves doing that, and you just, you know,
878480	880480	you get to sit there in your little director's chair
880480	882480	with hiding behind a mech.
882480	883480	I love Lucy.
883480	884480	What is this you got on your face?
884480	885480	I have no idea.
886480	887480	All right.
887480	888480	We'll give you one more chance.
888480	889480	We'll do Tarkovsky in space.
889480	890480	Tarkovsky.
890480	892480	Tarkovsky in space, okay.
892480	893480	Captain.
897480	900480	There is a potato shortage in the potato locker.
903480	906480	Potato's not important right now.
906480	908480	Go to airlock.
908480	910480	Captain, how can you say that?
910480	912480	The airlock is leaking.
912480	914480	There is a leak in the airlock.
914480	916480	With all due respect, Captain, it will not matter
916480	918480	if we have air or not, if we don't have potatoes.
920480	923480	You need air more than potatoes.
924480	925480	We shall see.
929480	931480	Yes, I'm just kidding.
935480	938480	Tarkovsky in space.
940480	941480	All right.
941480	942480	So.
943480	946480	He looks like he's getting into this one.
946480	947480	I didn't get it.
948480	949480	What just happened in this scene?
949480	950480	Someone died or?
950480	951480	Yeah.
951480	953480	Yeah, he had an oxygen mask.
953480	956480	I just haven't seen it, but yeah.
956480	959480	I can't see stuff around me with this mask, so yeah.
962480	963480	Fuck.
963480	966480	Are the little eye holes not cut out like in a certain aspect ratio
966480	968480	so you're always seeing the frame?
968480	969480	Yeah.
971480	972480	Come on, direct us.
972480	973480	Give us some fucking notes.
973480	975480	Some fucking notes on your improv.
976480	977480	Are this the story?
978480	981480	How would you, if that was the starting point of our rehearsal
981480	983480	and we were going to shoot this thing,
983480	985480	what would your direction be for this?
985480	988480	My direction would be don't do stupid accent
989480	991480	because it doesn't make sense.
991480	995480	If you're Russian, you either speak Russian
995480	998480	or if it's in a movie, you speak perfect English.
998480	1001480	You're speaking in a stupid Russian accent right now.
1002480	1005480	I mean, it's kind of a...
1005480	1006480	It's kind of the end.
1006480	1007480	I'm not in the movie.
1007480	1009480	The pot calling the samovar black.
1009480	1012480	Where have you seen reality in movies?
1012480	1014480	Where have you seen something real in movies?
1014480	1017480	I'm not in a movie, so I can't speak however I want.
1017480	1019480	It's pretty defensive.
1020480	1021480	All right.
1021480	1024480	Well, we'll check in with you again next semester
1024480	1026480	and see if you've learned anything.
1026480	1028480	Let's have a hand for Wobbly.
1031480	1032480	Edgy.
1034480	1036480	Dangerous Anatoly.
1037480	1040480	To be fair, though, my Russian accent was pretty crap.
1040480	1043480	It was kind of a real Eurorail pass.
1043480	1047480	Yeah, but, you know, lame.
1047480	1049480	Lame directing.
1050480	1053480	Supposed to tell us to get angry and then we get angry.
1053480	1055480	Then we would have gotten like,
1055480	1057480	good job directing us, we got angry.
1057480	1059480	That's all you had to do.
1060480	1063480	Now he's just flipping you off from the front row.
1065480	1066480	All right.
1066480	1069480	So that was the energy boost I needed to...
1073480	1077480	I was like taking another capsule of Molly.
1077480	1079480	When did they start calling it Molly?
1079480	1080480	Why did that happen?
1080480	1083480	They just keep moving that goal post.
1083480	1087480	When I first encountered it, we called it X.
1087480	1090480	Like Jamie Kennedy, X.
1090480	1092480	But then the kids were like, that's lame.
1092480	1093480	It's E.
1093480	1097480	I called it E for X to see.
1097480	1102480	And then it's Molly.
1102480	1106480	Is Molly just more of a pure MDMA kind of thing?
1106480	1109480	It's cut with amphetamine?
1109480	1112480	Molly's pure MDMA.
1112480	1114480	It's the other way around.
1114480	1118480	I think X to see has always had a little speedy component to it.
1118480	1123480	And then MDMA is more like, you can just wiggle your eyeballs.
1123480	1128480	Yeah, I went to the Hollywood Bowl and saw Holst's Planets.
1128480	1131480	And on a little bit of Molly and it was a groovy.
1131480	1132480	It was very good.
1132480	1134480	I recommend that.
1136480	1138480	Oh boy.
1138480	1140480	I say we're going to have bad shows a lot,
1140480	1143480	but I really meant it this time.
1143480	1147480	I feel like we can coast on Tartosky in space for another half hour.
1147480	1148480	I don't think that was that good.
1148480	1150480	I think they're being nice.
1150480	1151480	They want us to entertain them.
1151480	1153480	They feel stupid for paying $10.
1153480	1156480	They're going to tend to jump on anything they can.
1156480	1158480	And we don't even have Spencer tonight.
1161480	1164480	Spencer, do you hear that?
1164480	1167480	Spencer, can you hear me?
1167480	1170480	Well, let's try an experiment.
1170480	1174480	Eventually, I want to get these monitors in here so that we can do for the live stream.
1174480	1180480	We can do a feed and then people could tweet at us.
1180480	1183480	And then we can respond to them, kind of.
1188480	1189480	For now, let's just do like...
1189480	1193480	This show is like a fucking freight train of entertainment.
1193480	1196480	This is some breathless shit.
1197480	1200480	Oh my God.
1200480	1203480	I feel like a bum.
1203480	1204480	All right.
1204480	1205480	Pick a hashtag.
1205480	1208480	Hashtag Tartosky in space.
1208480	1211480	That's too hard to spell.
1211480	1214480	Hashtag potato locker.
1214480	1215480	Potato shortage.
1215480	1216480	Okay.
1216480	1218480	Hashtag...
1218480	1219480	Well...
1219480	1220480	Okay.
1220480	1221480	Potato...
1221480	1224480	Shortage...
1224480	1225480	Okay.
1225480	1230480	So if you're watching on the live feed, I guess these guys can too.
1230480	1231480	There goes...
1231480	1235480	There's eight laughs we were getting.
1235480	1241480	Just tweet something at hashtag potato shortage.
1241480	1242480	And then we'll...
1242480	1244480	And we can address their issues.
1244480	1245480	I love it.
1245480	1246480	The future is now.
1246480	1247480	Yeah.
1247480	1248480	Let's just wait for that.
1248480	1251480	So you're saying that we would have a monitor, like a screen where this would be happening
1251480	1252480	live during the show?
1252480	1253480	Like up here?
1253480	1254480	Something so that they can see.
1254480	1257480	Because the idea would be if you were watching the live stream, then it would be like a lower
1257480	1258480	third.
1258480	1262480	But then they have to see the same thing that the people on the live stream are seeing.
1262480	1264480	That's the difficulty.
1264480	1269480	I'd like to do more visual stuff just to make people mad that are listening for free.
1269480	1274480	They're going to wonder what the hell was on Anatoly's face the entire time.
1274480	1279480	We'll start playing fun photos from a safari.
1280480	1283480	Is Erin here tonight or is she recovering from hypothetical serotonin levels?
1283480	1289480	She went with a group of like 50 girls to see Fifty Shades of Grey.
1289480	1292480	They did a whole outing.
1292480	1300480	I don't know if those were groans of pleasure or pain as the source material I guess would
1300480	1302480	want me to be confused, right?
1302480	1303480	I'm assuming.
1303480	1305480	There's a blurred line.
1305480	1306480	I don't know.
1306480	1307480	Isn't it?
1307480	1308480	It's about S&M stuff.
1308480	1309480	Fine.
1309480	1311480	God damn it.
1311480	1313480	Not Fifty Shades of Grey.
1313480	1315480	I was reading another book.
1315480	1316480	What book were you reading?
1316480	1317480	It's called Rubicon.
1317480	1319480	It's about the last days of the Roman Empire.
1319480	1320480	It was very good.
1320480	1321480	Has anybody read it?
1321480	1322480	Tom Holland, right?
1322480	1325480	Really well written stuff and then of course leave it on the plane.
1325480	1327480	You got a copy of it?
1327480	1328480	You audio booked it?
1328480	1329480	Yeah.
1329480	1330480	I have to go find it.
1330480	1331480	All right.
1331480	1332480	Hit me with a fucking rap beat.
1332480	1333480	Oh shit.
1334480	1337480	Let's just get this thing.
1337480	1339480	Let's go deep.
1339480	1340480	Yeah.
1340480	1341480	Yeah.
1341480	1342480	Yeah.
1342480	1343480	Yeah.
1347480	1348480	Yeah.
1348480	1349480	Yeah.
1349480	1350480	Yeah.
1350480	1351480	Big pile of booties out front.
1351480	1352480	Fuck your mouth.
1352480	1355480	That's the only thing that rhymes with that is...
1358480	1359480	All right.
1359480	1360480	All right.
1360480	1361480	That's enough.
1364480	1366480	That's how this is going to go.
1366480	1369480	I thought it would bring up the energy, but...
1369480	1374480	It's not that the rap bar was ever set that high by you, but that was poor.
1374480	1375480	That was very poor.
1375480	1377480	I didn't get to the first rhyme.
1377480	1379480	But I'm calling that a victory.
1379480	1381480	Not getting to the rhyme of that one.
1381480	1382480	Yeah.
1382480	1383480	Oh, I got one.
1383480	1384480	All right.
1384480	1385480	Play it.
1385480	1386480	Do you like that beat?
1386480	1389480	You want to feel something else?
1389480	1390480	Play the same one.
1390480	1391480	All right.
1391480	1392480	Let's spray it back on you.
1394480	1395480	Yeah.
1395480	1396480	Yeah.
1396480	1397480	Yeah.
1397480	1398480	Yeah.
1398480	1399480	Yeah.
1399480	1400480	Yeah.
1400480	1401480	Baby dance.
1401480	1402480	Baby dance.
1402480	1403480	Baby dance.
1403480	1404480	Baby dance.
1404480	1405480	Big pile of booties out front.
1405480	1408480	Candid camera hosted by Alan Funke.
1408480	1410480	Saw your mama just the other day.
1410480	1412480	Got her on my knees and I started to pray.
1412480	1415480	Because your mama's booty is like a god to me.
1415480	1417480	It's all that I ever see.
1417480	1418480	Like a Tootsie Roll.
1418480	1420480	In those old ads.
1420480	1421480	I fucked your mama.
1421480	1423480	Her name is Tad.
1426480	1429480	Thaddeus by birth.
1429480	1433480	Then later shortened to the informal Tad.
1433480	1435480	I took your mama to the beach.
1435480	1437480	I fed her apples.
1437480	1438480	I fed her a peach.
1438480	1442480	She started to get heartburn because the citric acid.
1442480	1447480	That's what we learned is causing her esophagus to fuck her up.
1447480	1450480	Now she's in a sarcophagus.
1450480	1451480	She's not dead.
1451480	1454480	She's just getting out of her head.
1454480	1456480	A little meditation exercise.
1456480	1460480	Fuck your mama between her juicy thighs.
1460480	1461480	Put my head inside.
1461480	1463480	I got reverse born.
1463480	1465480	Now I'm wide.
1467480	1470480	I'm wide.
1470480	1472480	W-I-D-E.
1472480	1473480	I meant to say it.
1473480	1476480	It's a new way to stay cool.
1476480	1477480	Wide.
1477480	1479480	You're wide now.
1486480	1489480	See, I feel that energy now.
1489480	1490480	But it doesn't really matter.
1490480	1491480	That gave them energy.
1491480	1492480	Then they give it to me.
1492480	1494480	And what do I do with it?
1494480	1497480	I gotta say, man, that shit was wide.
1497480	1499480	That shit was wide.
1499480	1501480	Hashtag potato shortage.
1503480	1504480	All right.
1504480	1509480	Well, I mean, let's bring out DuBorj.
1509480	1511480	DuBorj Brown!
1513480	1515480	Downtown DuBorj Brown.
1530480	1535480	Boy, this is what you have to see in the live stream to really get to...
1535480	1536480	Yeah.
1536480	1538480	There's a lot of visual goodies going on here.
1538480	1541480	That's pretty wide, man.
1543480	1546480	What is wide for you is wide for other people, right?
1548480	1549480	All right.
1549480	1552480	So, the Chinese are at it again.
1555480	1557480	Fucking Chinese, man.
1558480	1560480	I don't have anything.
1560480	1563480	Let's check the feed.
1564480	1566480	Okay, let's see here.
1566480	1567480	How are you, DuBorj?
1567480	1569480	It's a very exciting shirt you have on there.
1569480	1570480	Oh, thank you very much.
1570480	1571480	Well, it's Valentine's Day weekend.
1571480	1574480	I thought I would do something for myself.
1574480	1576480	As I'm only with myself.
1576480	1577480	Single ladies.
1577480	1579480	Are you single, gentlemen?
1579480	1580480	Yeah, I am.
1580480	1582480	For how long?
1582480	1584480	Until someone solves everything.
1585480	1588480	Until someone solves that riddle, you know?
1589480	1591480	What was the last time you were in a serious...
1591480	1592480	Ah, geez.
1592480	1593480	Like a couple of years ago, I think.
1593480	1594480	Yeah?
1594480	1595480	Yeah.
1595480	1596480	It was interesting.
1596480	1598480	What's your record for the longest relationship?
1598480	1599480	I think like seven years?
1599480	1600480	Seven years.
1600480	1601480	Six years?
1601480	1602480	Like college and then some.
1602480	1603480	Wow.
1603480	1605480	Yeah, just a wonderful person.
1605480	1606480	She was a great person.
1606480	1607480	She was a good kid.
1607480	1608480	And then what?
1608480	1610480	And then I moved to Los Angeles.
1610480	1612480	I think, you know, I wanted to be an actor.
1612480	1615480	I actually wanted to be a human being, and I think that's it.
1616480	1621480	And so I had to become fictional.
1621480	1623480	These tweets are very critical.
1631480	1634480	Maybe this is a bad emotional road to walk down right now.
1634480	1641480	This guy says, I think you'd be surprised how many people would watch a live stream of Dan just staring at his phone.
1643480	1644480	Hmm.
1645480	1647480	Hashtag potato shortage?
1647480	1650480	I guess I'll hear this on Wednesday, says this guy.
1651480	1653480	Damn, Dan can't even rap.
1653480	1655480	What horrible mush has he made his mind?
1655480	1656480	Whoa!
1656480	1657480	I know, yeah.
1657480	1658480	It's terrible.
1658480	1659480	Damn.
1659480	1665480	Josh Cahill says, I felt massive shame this week when I accidentally bought one ply toilet paper.
1668480	1669480	I had that.
1670480	1682480	The first time I ever went grocery shopping with Erin, it was like, she hadn't, I don't think she'd moved in yet, but it was sort of like, you know, there's that sort of like one day in a relationship, you kind of, you both go grocery shopping together.
1683480	1693480	And she, I remember early in our relationship, Erin went through a very brief phase of trying to impress me with how frugal she was and how unimpressed she was with my money.
1694480	1696480	So if I would say like, let's just take a cab there.
1696480	1698480	She'd be like, no, no, we can drive.
1698480	1700480	Like, no, it's safer to take a cab.
1700480	1705480	But she bought, I needed toilet paper and she got this giant pack.
1705480	1709480	So like, this is, look, this is like, look at this big pack of toilet paper.
1710480	1711480	Look how cheap it is.
1711480	1712480	I'm like, okay, I'm very impressed.
1712480	1717480	And it was one ply and I'm still wiping my ass with it.
1718480	1719480	You haven't got it.
1719480	1722480	It's only just now start down to like one roll and finally this.
1722480	1724480	What is the problem with one ply?
1724480	1725480	What is the problem with one ply?
1725480	1726480	I was asking a question.
1726480	1727480	I don't.
1727480	1729480	I mean, it's like toilet paper is.
1729480	1730480	No, you should.
1730480	1732480	Toilet paper is one of those things that you have to spend all the money on.
1732480	1734480	Like, like, don't skimp.
1734480	1735480	It was a dollar difference.
1735480	1736480	Go get the good shit.
1737480	1743480	Until they come up with better technology than just paper to wipe the shit out of your butt.
1744480	1746480	The thicker, the better.
1746480	1753480	Like, the more between you and what your body is even saying, don't go near this.
1753480	1755480	Don't go with the wispy stuff.
1755480	1756480	Don't put this in your hand.
1756480	1759480	This is coming out to the other side.
1760480	1763480	Don't you think it's interesting that we are just worms?
1766480	1768480	You know, a multicellular organism.
1768480	1769480	Worms with hands.
1769480	1770480	It becomes like a circle.
1771480	1773480	It increases the surface area.
1773480	1780480	Basically, we evolved from, you know, the first multicellular organisms were like these tubes.
1780480	1783480	So, like, shit would go and digest through.
1783480	1785480	And we're still tubes.
1785480	1789480	This is outside your body, inside your butt.
1789480	1793480	Like, what you're doing when you take a cookie and you put it in your mouth,
1793480	1796480	you're just rubbing the outside of your body along it.
1800480	1803480	Some would say the worm is on the inside.
1803480	1804480	The worm is on the inside?
1804480	1805480	Yeah.
1805480	1807480	And that we are on the outside doing other things.
1807480	1814480	Well, yeah, we have built on our worm a whole life.
1814480	1816480	It's just getting way too wide for me, man.
1818480	1822480	Well, thank you, Josh Cahill, for not saying shitty things.
1822480	1823480	Are any of the cameras on?
1823480	1824480	I don't see any red lights.
1825480	1833480	This guy's just sending other rhymes for front.
1833480	1834480	Oh, dear.
1834480	1836480	That could be risky.
1836480	1838480	They're mostly asking about potatoes.
1838480	1840480	I think that's a mistake we made.
1840480	1841480	Where's Kumail?
1841480	1842480	That's a good question.
1842480	1843480	Where's Kumail?
1843480	1844480	Are we going to get some Kumail?
1844480	1846480	How excited are you about Fifty Shades?
1846480	1848480	What feed is this?
1848480	1852480	I had them tweet at potato, the hashtag potato shortage.
1853480	1857480	Any relationship advice on how to stop a communication breakdown from snowballing?
1857480	1858480	Hmm.
1858480	1859480	All right.
1859480	1860480	Okay.
1860480	1863480	How to keep a communication breakdown from snowballing?
1863480	1875480	You have to learn that your feelings are your feelings and your thoughts are your thoughts.
1875480	1878480	And the mistake that we all make is we say,
1878480	1881480	look, you're making me very angry right now.
1881480	1884480	Or I feel like when you come home late from work, blah, blah, blah.
1884480	1886480	We're constantly doing that.
1886480	1889480	We're going, like, I feel like you're a piece of shit.
1889480	1891480	Which is really impossible.
1891480	1894480	It's not honest.
1894480	1896480	Isn't that the good part that when somebody says, I feel?
1896480	1899480	Because normally what people say is you're a piece of shit.
1899480	1901480	And they don't mean I feel you're a piece of shit.
1901480	1902480	Right, exactly.
1902480	1906480	So you have to tend your own garden and express what is actually happening inside of you.
1906480	1908480	Just think of it this way.
1908480	1910480	What's something that nobody could argue with?
1910480	1911480	You know?
1911480	1916480	Like, if you said, oh, well, I'm just uncomfortable right now.
1916480	1918480	I don't expect you to do anything.
1918480	1922480	Like, anybody who would say, well, you shouldn't be uncomfortable, they're an asshole.
1922480	1926480	Like, but if you say to somebody, I'm uncomfortable, so you should move your car.
1926480	1928480	You should go do something else.
1928480	1933480	Then that person is allowed to then say, well, if I move my car, I'm going to feel like this or that.
1933480	1935480	But the important thing is to communicate your feelings.
1935480	1937480	Especially with your lover.
1937480	1939480	Like, no one needs their car moved or anything like that.
1939480	1944480	All that ever happens is you both are afraid that the other one has stopped loving you.
1944480	1948480	And then somebody says, like, I feel sad because you did something.
1948480	1950480	And then the other person is like, that's bullshit.
1950480	1951480	I'm not the reason you're sad.
1951480	1953480	And now I feel angry at you.
1953480	1955480	And you're not really sharing feelings, your own feelings.
1955480	1957480	You're just yelling shit at each other.
1957480	1959480	Are you still doing the couples therapy thing?
1959480	1960480	Yeah, can't you tell?
1960480	1962480	I'm fucking...
1962480	1964480	I'm a master now.
1965480	1969480	Except I took off my wedding ring at work and it's sitting on my desk.
1970480	1971480	Wow.
1971480	1972480	Yeah.
1972480	1973480	Oh, boy.
1973480	1974480	It's okay.
1974480	1976480	It'll still be there.
1976480	1980480	But, yeah, that could have been, like, a desk made of quicksand.
1982480	1983480	So lesson learned.
1983480	1985480	Don't take off your wedding ring.
1985480	1987480	You're always working right now.
1987480	1989480	You're pretty much a community all the time, right?
1989480	1990480	Yeah.
1990480	1991480	Does that take a toll on you and Aaron?
1991480	1993480	Like, if you don't have a lot of time to spend...
1993480	1995480	It's a very big challenge, yeah.
1995480	1996480	Yeah.
1996480	1997480	Yeah.
1997480	1999480	It'll bring the bad stuff out.
1999480	2000480	Is she here tonight?
2000480	2001480	Is she coming?
2001480	2002480	She's watching...
2002480	2003480	Oh, I already asked.
2003480	2004480	50 Shades of Grey.
2004480	2005480	All right.
2005480	2009480	Yeah, it's tough, but we're dealing with it.
2009480	2010480	We're all right.
2010480	2014480	When's the light at the end of the tunnel for you being finished with Community?
2014480	2015480	Sorry, what?
2015480	2016480	I was reading my Twitter feed.
2016480	2017480	All right.
2017480	2019480	Are you almost done with Community?
2019480	2020480	Oh, yeah.
2020480	2023480	We're shooting, like, the ninth episode.
2023480	2025480	Matt Berry flies in on Tuesday.
2025480	2027480	We're going to do an episode of that.
2027480	2028480	What?
2028480	2029480	Oh, shit.
2029480	2030480	You know what?
2030480	2031480	Not a woman.
2031480	2033480	That reminds me.
2033480	2037480	Reminder, write script for Matt Berry for Tuesday.
2042480	2044480	See, you're casting without any script?
2044480	2045480	Are you just saying?
2045480	2046480	Yeah, we did.
2046480	2047480	We want you on a thing.
2047480	2049480	Well, we're in there international like that.
2049480	2052480	You got to book them well in advance and schedule everything with them.
2052480	2054480	So we knew we were going to do an episode with Matt Berry.
2054480	2057480	Now we know, as of yesterday, I woke up.
2057480	2058480	I know what we're going to do.
2058480	2062480	But then yesterday, I played vanilla...
2062480	2063480	...Valentine's.
2066480	2067480	Wow.
2068480	2069480	Valentine's Day.
2070480	2071480	Vanilla-teen.
2072480	2074480	And today was Vanilla Minecraft.
2075480	2083480	Tomorrow, which is a holiday, I'll slave over a hot keyboard for Matt Berry.
2083480	2085480	A hit will be born.
2086480	2088480	I want to hear you discuss Kanye West.
2088480	2092480	I find him to be super wide, but there seems to be a perception...
2092480	2095480	I really hope that gains traction.
2096480	2099480	I want wide to become a thing for the rest of our lives.
2100480	2101480	Yeah, I don't know.
2101480	2104480	The SNL's doing their 40-year anniversary tonight,
2104480	2108480	and I have seen some tweets being critical of Kanye.
2108480	2111480	I'm a little out of touch with Kanye.
2113480	2115480	What's going on in Kanye News?
2115480	2116480	Is he a pariah?
2116480	2119480	He seems like he's a very talented producer and rapper,
2119480	2122480	but he also seems like he's kind of a ding-dong, right?
2124480	2127480	Somebody's given him a formula that says every six days,
2127480	2129480	he's got to do something publicly.
2129480	2131480	And the weirder it is, the better.
2131480	2133480	And so he just kind of plays that ball back and forth.
2133480	2136480	I mean, you know, it all falls away.
2136480	2139480	And then when people start to lose patience with him,
2139480	2142480	he just throws a slab of incredible music out and tours for two years
2142480	2143480	and then comes back.
2143480	2145480	I think it's fine, man.
2145480	2147480	I like that Gold Digger song.
2150480	2151480	You know what I just heard?
2151480	2153480	I don't know shit about hip-hop.
2153480	2156480	My friend Morgan Groby, he loves hip-hop,
2156480	2159480	and he played that song, Monster, for me with Nicki Minaj.
2159480	2160480	And who else is on that, Jay-Z?
2160480	2162480	It's fucking good.
2162480	2164480	She's really good on that, too.
2164480	2166480	I was very excited about it.
2166480	2169480	That's the end of my rap knowledge.
2171480	2177480	When I was in high school, we all had really big sound systems in our car.
2177480	2181480	We all had stolen speakers and amps and all this shit.
2181480	2184480	Alpine and blah punks and all that stuff.
2184480	2187480	And we would all play, it was all hip-hop all the time,
2187480	2190480	and we were just a bunch of white assholes.
2190480	2192480	It was really cheesy.
2192480	2195480	Like two live crew and shit, like terrible.
2195480	2197480	Candace Razzo says,
2197480	2201480	I want to have sex with my boyfriend while he watches Harmontown.
2201480	2205480	This seems like an extraordinarily bad idea.
2205480	2207480	Are we supposed to give her the thumbs up?
2207480	2208480	Go ahead.
2208480	2213480	I think they should do that on the condition that there's photos made available.
2214480	2218480	This guy wants me to flip off Anatoly, all right.
2219480	2222480	And this guy wants me to take off my shirt.
2222480	2225480	He wants sad shirtless Dan, please.
2227480	2230480	That apparently is going to happen.
2233480	2237480	Let's get ready to rumble.
2244480	2247480	Come on, come on, Coco.
2247480	2250480	That really is wide.
2255480	2257480	Can you actually start crying?
2257480	2260480	Can you produce an actual tear for us, Dan?
2260480	2263480	It's the new Coco.
2263480	2266480	All right, I'm going to try to really cry.
2266480	2274480	I'm so fat.
2277480	2280480	The earth is dying.
2280480	2284480	My dad's going to die.
2284480	2287480	I can't. There's nothing in there.
2291480	2294480	I mean, my dad's not sick or anything.
2294480	2296480	Otherwise, that would probably work.
2296480	2301480	Wait, what was the order? Fat, earth is dying, my dad's going to die.
2304480	2307480	Remember the improv show we did where you ended up naked on stage
2307480	2311480	and you had a nosebleed so you were covered in blood
2311480	2314480	and holding your junk and I sang you a lullaby
2314480	2318480	and you were just pouring bright, incredibly red blood
2318480	2321480	and Jack Black was in the audience and we were so embarrassed
2321480	2323480	and he comes back out of the chair and he goes,
2323480	2327480	guys, that was a fucking fiasco.
2331480	2333480	It really was.
2333480	2336480	I just realized we really undermined Candace
2336480	2341480	but your boyfriend's probably not going to be able to perform.
2341480	2355480	Candace's boyfriend, just look from the neck down
2355480	2359480	where I'm a beautiful lady.
2359480	2366480	Don't listen to those haters' hate, says at Embrace La Base.
2366480	2369480	Your show is going fucking great.
2369480	2378480	This guy says, this show is great even without serotonin.
2378480	2381480	This guy says, keep talking about your butt.
2381480	2390480	So remember when Spencer talked about his caloric,
2391480	2394480	remember that nest cyst or whatever?
2394480	2400480	The day he started talking about that, I got one
2400480	2403480	and I've had it the whole time.
2403480	2405480	Could that really be some kind of psychosomatic,
2405480	2408480	like I got this thing that Spencer talked about and I had it
2408480	2411480	and then it finally started to go away
2411480	2414480	and then the next day Spencer told me his went away.
2414480	2417480	That's the end of that story.
2420480	2426480	I got nothing.
2426480	2429480	This show is really something.
2429480	2431480	This one's probably for Jeff.
2431480	2433480	I'm trying to learn to make better scones.
2433480	2435480	What type of fruit or filling should I add?
2435480	2440480	Fuck you, Dan.
2440480	2442480	Scones suck, right?
2442480	2443480	Scones aren't good.
2443480	2444480	I'm not a big fan of them.
2444480	2445480	You don't want a fucking scone ever.
2445480	2447480	You want a croissant or a fucking...
2447480	2449480	Yeah, something flaky, something light.
2449480	2451480	No, so you want a biscuit.
2451480	2453480	It's like cakey gravel, sort of.
2453480	2454480	No, it's not good.
2454480	2458480	If you're having scones, you're doing it wrong, I believe.
2458480	2460480	My advice is don't make scones.
2460480	2463480	It's like aim higher, is my advice.
2468480	2469480	This guy says,
2469480	2472480	Woman pouring her hot coffee into the trash.
2472480	2474480	I said, you'll start a fire.
2474480	2478480	She looked at the stream coming out and screamed.
2478480	2480480	Unscreamed.
2480480	2483480	That's just a crazy guy.
2483480	2484480	You think?
2484480	2486480	Maybe that's the one guy who's using the hashtag
2486480	2489480	potato shortage for something else.
2494480	2496480	After the moon base gets set up,
2496480	2498480	can harmonians colonize other celestial bodies
2498480	2500480	like Europa or something?
2500480	2502480	Yes.
2503480	2504480	On the next rixty minutes,
2504480	2506480	might they catch an episode of Community?
2506480	2508480	I don't know.
2508480	2511480	I saw that fly too, Demorge.
2511480	2512480	That's eight minutes ago.
2512480	2513480	Yeah.
2513480	2515480	There was an enormous prehistoric animal
2515480	2516480	flew by your head.
2516480	2518480	That's a good gnat.
2518480	2520480	Yeah, it was large.
2520480	2521480	Damon Gentry says,
2521480	2522480	Dan, do you ever get writer's block?
2522480	2524480	What do you do if that happens?
2524480	2525480	Aha.
2525480	2526480	Hmm.
2531480	2532480	You're adorable.
2532480	2533480	You're so cute.
2533480	2535480	Oh, thank you.
2535480	2538480	You're like the little Benihana guy.
2538480	2539480	Benihana guy?
2539480	2541480	Yeah, like the Benihana restaurant logo,
2541480	2542480	like a little Buddha guy.
2542480	2546480	Oh, I'd say Benihana guy.
2546480	2547480	Benihana guy.
2547480	2550480	Yeah, you get a different one time
2550480	2552480	for each of the eight days.
2556480	2557480	Oh, writer's block.
2557480	2559480	Yeah, I've said this a thousand times before,
2559480	2563480	but it's good advice.
2563480	2566480	Prove that you're a bad writer.
2566480	2567480	There you go.
2567480	2568480	Okay.
2569480	2571480	You're trying to prove that you're a good writer.
2571480	2572480	That's what's blocking you.
2572480	2575480	Because no matter how good you get,
2575480	2576480	you're always going to think
2576480	2578480	that you should be better than you are
2578480	2579480	because you want to be a good writer.
2579480	2581480	And you will be by thinking that.
2581480	2583480	But it's not going to get you writing right now.
2583480	2584480	And the only thing that's going to make you get better
2584480	2585480	is practicing.
2585480	2587480	And the only thing you're going to be able to write right now
2587480	2590480	is something worse than what you think you should be writing.
2590480	2592480	So you have to stop thinking about the thing
2592480	2593480	that you're eventually going to be able to do.
2593480	2595480	And you have to start thinking about the thing
2595480	2596480	that you're terrified you will do
2596480	2598480	because that will go by very quickly.
2598480	2599480	It's like cheating.
2599480	2601480	It's like putting shit in your gas tank.
2601480	2604480	It's like putting exhaust in your gas tank.
2604480	2606480	It's like the thing your car makes that you can't use.
2606480	2608480	You can fuel your car on it, technically.
2608480	2610480	Just write badly.
2610480	2611480	I mean, it's not...
2612480	2615480	And specifically, do that by saying,
2615480	2617480	okay, I'm going to actually go there.
2617480	2620480	I'm going to actually show myself what a piece of shit writer
2620480	2623480	I really am without thinking about any of it.
2623480	2626480	I'm impressed by the uniformity of your chest hair.
2626480	2628480	It's just perfectly...
2628480	2629480	It's very even.
2629480	2630480	Do you trim that?
2630480	2632480	Or is that just natural?
2632480	2633480	Yes.
2633480	2636480	Yes, I spend a great deal of time on my chest hair
2636480	2638480	and this is the result.
2642480	2648480	I spend five hours a day to achieve the...
2651480	2653480	God damn it, I forgot his name.
2653480	2656480	You've got a very impressive little back neck tuft
2656480	2658480	going on there, too.
2658480	2661480	Who's the porn star that ever...
2661480	2663480	Yeah, Ron Jeremy.
2663480	2665480	Would have been funny.
2665480	2671480	Let's all take our shirts off.
2677480	2679480	What is your thoughts on Spider-Man
2679480	2681480	in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?
2681480	2683480	Bad grammar.
2683480	2685480	Just kidding, I don't care.
2685480	2688480	Oh, I heard a rumor about Spider-Man
2688480	2690480	that Sony and Marvel are now going to be...
2690480	2692480	It's not a rumor, it's news, right?
2692480	2695480	Sony and Marvel are going to be sharing Spider-Man now
2695480	2697480	in some weird way.
2697480	2699480	Sony gets to make Spider-Man movies
2699480	2700480	and so does Marvel,
2700480	2702480	and they don't make money off of each other's movies
2702480	2704480	but they're going to use the same Spider-Man...
2704480	2706480	Are they using the same Spider-Man?
2706480	2707480	The same Spider-Man, yeah.
2707480	2709480	Which means they're going to have to have
2709480	2712480	some kind of web slinger summit.
2712480	2715480	I don't know what to make of it.
2715480	2718480	Movies are for children now.
2718480	2720480	I don't care anymore.
2721480	2723480	Will Erin be playing the role of Christian Grey
2723480	2727480	when she comes home tonight?
2729480	2732480	I don't know.
2732480	2733480	Who in here has read those books,
2733480	2735480	or any of those books?
2735480	2736480	Applause, anybody?
2736480	2738480	You?
2738480	2741480	There's a lot of guilty looking faces out there.
2741480	2742480	Nobody, really?
2742480	2743480	One and a half.
2743480	2744480	One and a half?
2744480	2746480	Are they really bad?
2746480	2748480	There's too much sex.
2748480	2750480	There's too much sex?
2750480	2751480	That's your complaint?
2751480	2752480	Who is that?
2752480	2753480	I'm like, I'm ordering a pizza
2753480	2755480	without having sex with each other.
2755480	2759480	And it's not hot the fuck down, you guys.
2760480	2762480	She wants less fucking.
2762480	2764480	She's like...
2764480	2766480	Or more pizza.
2769480	2771480	I missed all of that.
2771480	2772480	I'm sorry.
2772480	2773480	She was saying they're bad books
2773480	2776480	because people are fucking just too wantedly.
2776480	2778480	No one can walk five steps, apparently,
2778480	2781480	without just Roger-ing somebody next to them or whatever.
2781480	2782480	That's what the movie's about?
2782480	2784480	It's just like everyone's just doing it with each other?
2784480	2785480	I don't know.
2785480	2786480	It's a book.
2786480	2787480	The book.
2787480	2789480	Bring her up?
2789480	2791480	Bring her up.
2792480	2794480	Will you come up on stage so we can see you and hear you?
2794480	2795480	I want to talk about this.
2795480	2797480	What's your name?
2798480	2800480	Let's put a face to the shame.
2800480	2802480	Give me a hug.
2802480	2803480	Come on, give me a hug.
2803480	2804480	No, I'm kidding.
2804480	2805480	Sorry.
2807480	2808480	Yeah, there you go.
2808480	2809480	What's your name, Madam?
2809480	2810480	My name is Angel.
2810480	2811480	Hello, Angel.
2811480	2812480	Welcome.
2812480	2813480	Thank you.
2813480	2814480	You're looking very smart.
2814480	2815480	Obviously.
2816480	2817480	All right, so...
2817480	2818480	Hello.
2818480	2819480	This is like reading Rainbow.
2819480	2822480	You're going to give us your book report on Fifty Shades of Grey.
2822480	2823480	All right.
2823480	2825480	Now, you say you're a book and a half in.
2825480	2827480	Does that mean that you are currently reading one of the books?
2827480	2829480	My friend and I both, I think, we got to the same place.
2829480	2831480	And we were like...
2831480	2833480	I can't believe I actually wanted there to be a plot.
2833480	2835480	I didn't think there was enough back then.
2835480	2837480	Guess get her up here.
2839480	2840480	Bring it on up, sister.
2840480	2841480	Bring it on up.
2841480	2843480	Point, counterpoint.
2845480	2847480	Now we have a discussion on our hands.
2847480	2850480	Oh, and then we have a good question I got tweeted in.
2850480	2851480	We already have our piano.
2851480	2852480	Oh, gosh.
2852480	2853480	We'll do it now.
2853480	2854480	Okay, what is your name?
2854480	2855480	My name is Laura.
2855480	2856480	Angel and Laura.
2856480	2859480	Okay, so one of you says too much sex, one says not enough.
2860480	2861480	Yep.
2861480	2862480	Guess how our lives go.
2863480	2868480	I know how tonight's going to go.
2868480	2870480	Let us know.
2870480	2876480	I agree that they'd be in a restaurant and all of a sudden they have to have sex, but I don't know.
2876480	2878480	Don't even go to the bathroom.
2878480	2879480	Go in the parking lot.
2879480	2880480	I don't know.
2880480	2881480	It's just that you need to calm down.
2881480	2882480	But it wasn't good sex.
2882480	2883480	That's the point.
2883480	2884480	If there's going to be sex, it should be good.
2884480	2885480	It's really repetitive sex.
2885480	2887480	It's like if you just had missionary sex.
2887480	2889480	It's weird because it's about S&M, but it's like...
2889480	2891480	I don't give a shit anymore.
2891480	2896480	Older people like it and think it's risque, but we grew up with the internet, so it's not.
2897480	2898480	Interesting.
2899480	2904480	Some of those old people grew up on the internet, so we're actually just bored with all sex.
2905480	2909480	I feel like I'm just like an asexual lump of clay.
2909480	2911480	You really don't look like it.
2911480	2912480	Thanks, baby.
2912480	2923480	So, somebody asked a question that I think we can all take a stab at here.
2924480	2930480	This person's Twitter handle is yessie underscore bev, and they say,
2930480	2935480	if you could tell one person about 9-11 before it happened, who would you tell and why?
2935480	2937480	What would change?
2937480	2939480	You got to pick one person.
2939480	2941480	It's pretty easy, right?
2941480	2942480	No, don't you just...
2942480	2944480	You tell...
2946480	2947480	The pilot?
2947480	2949480	The pilot knew.
2949480	2951480	The pilot knows, yeah.
2951480	2952480	You mean like the actual pilot.
2952480	2954480	What's your own personal life?
2954480	2959480	Don't you just tell the...
2959480	2964480	I'd tell her, so I could just say, I told you so, and make her mad.
2964480	2968480	No, you tell some really old school New York cop.
2968480	2972480	Like some guy who's seen it all.
2972480	2974480	Somebody should...
2974480	2977480	I mean, I'm not saying that I'm the guy who would do this,
2977480	2984480	but somebody should have told Bryant Gumbel because the video of him,
2984480	2987480	as it's going down, is insane.
2987480	2988480	He just...
2988480	2992480	It's the most confounding thing in the world because they're telling him what's going down,
2992480	2995480	and he's just sitting there going, so let me understand.
2995480	2997480	There's a building.
2997480	2998480	And it's like you're there.
2998480	2999480	You're in this.
2999480	3000480	He's in it as it's going on.
3000480	3002480	It goes on for hours and hours and hours.
3002480	3004480	And he still doesn't...
3004480	3008480	He wouldn't get off the air so that somebody could explain to him what was going on.
3008480	3010480	And I can't imagine if people were trying to explain to him what was going on.
3010480	3014480	And it was all live feeds with people telling him what was happening,
3014480	3017480	and he just kept repeating the same question over,
3017480	3019480	and people were getting angry with him.
3019480	3021480	Was experts on the ground were getting angry?
3021480	3024480	Was he just in disbelief or he was just a thunderstruck or he wasn't playing?
3024480	3025480	No, it was just him...
3025480	3028480	I don't know what he was doing, but it was just him and his own rhetoric
3028480	3031480	just sort of trying to parlay this into a real sports interview
3031480	3032480	as if it was a hypothetical.
3032480	3033480	And it's just...
3033480	3037480	You know, then the backdrop changes, and now there are no buildings.
3037480	3040480	And he still just kind of like struggled with it.
3040480	3044480	There's an ad now with he and...
3044480	3045480	Katie Couric.
3045480	3046480	Katie Couric.
3046480	3050480	And it's based on this humor scene with them dealing with the internet.
3050480	3056480	But this is like the same thing with this real non-humorous event
3056480	3060480	that's going on in real time, and it's just...
3060480	3061480	Fuck that guy.
3061480	3063480	I read it a bad way.
3063480	3064480	I just sort of like...
3064480	3068480	Will there be a 912?
3068480	3073480	Yes.
3073480	3076480	You know what would be a good movie?
3076480	3077480	Because you have that...
3077480	3081480	It starts with that question, like Michael Caine is Mr. Destiny or somebody
3081480	3086480	who comes and says, like, you can go, Juan, anybody you want.
3086480	3088480	About 911, go.
3088480	3089480	And then you go...
3089480	3094480	And then it cuts to Robert Downey Jr. goes up the White House steps,
3094480	3097480	and he's like, Mr. President.
3097480	3099480	And Mr. President says, yeah.
3099480	3102480	And he says, the 911's going to happen.
3102480	3105480	And then he's like, let me explain exactly what 911's going to be.
3105480	3108480	I got 10 minutes, and then you don't want to hear it all,
3108480	3112480	so you cut to like a cigarette that shortens.
3112480	3114480	And then he's like...
3114480	3119480	And it's going to happen on 911, and the mnemonic device for that is...
3119480	3122480	It's an emergency, and also it's September 11th.
3122480	3124480	So 2001, so...
3124480	3125480	Okay.
3125480	3127480	All right, thank you, says the President.
3127480	3131480	And then he doesn't tell him that he's traveled in time, though.
3131480	3134480	So then he goes back to the present, Robert Downey Jr.,
3134480	3138480	and he gets there, and it's like, everything's the same.
3138480	3142480	911 happened just the same way.
3142480	3144480	You know why?
3144480	3146480	They let it happen.
3153480	3157480	He spends some time trying to make sure, oh, maybe it was a dream.
3157480	3162480	And he's the only guy that can prove that it actually was an inside job,
3162480	3163480	because he told him.
3163480	3164480	Right.
3164480	3168480	But his evidence is a strange story about going back in time.
3168480	3169480	He's like, I totally time travel.
3169480	3170480	Yeah.
3170480	3171480	But he has...
3171480	3177480	The President makes the mistake of saying, this was great 911 forewarning.
3177480	3178480	Thank you.
3178480	3181480	I want you to take my lucky rabbit's foot.
3181480	3184480	It's a presidential lucky rabbit's foot.
3184480	3189480	The guy didn't think anything of it, and when he traveled back to the present,
3190480	3199480	he ran into his ex-girlfriend, who he hates, but who he loves,
3199480	3202480	and he gives it to her.
3202480	3203480	He goes like, you know what?
3203480	3204480	Here, take this.
3204480	3207480	She's like, I'm going to go study overseas.
3207480	3208480	And he's like, take this.
3208480	3209480	And she's like, why?
3209480	3212480	He's like, just something someone gave me.
3212480	3216480	So then he goes home, and it's like, oh, 911 happened just like regular.
3216480	3217480	And he's like, what?
3217480	3220480	It must have been an inside job, because of that rabbit's foot.
3220480	3221480	I got to get that rabbit's foot.
3221480	3224480	But my ex-girlfriend has it, and I hate her.
3224480	3226480	And she's overseas.
3226480	3229480	I need another Michael Caine scene at this point.
3229480	3237480	I told you, the rules to this thing can't go back once.
3237480	3238480	Come on.
3238480	3239480	I need it.
3239480	3240480	Oh, yeah.
3240480	3241480	Stop.
3241480	3242480	Wait.
3242480	3243480	Get that.
3243480	3244480	Oh.
3244480	3245480	So yes?
3245480	3246480	No.
3246480	3247480	No.
3247480	3248480	Yeah.
3248480	3254480	Is Robert Downey Jr. playing himself?
3254480	3255480	Yeah.
3255480	3256480	Yes.
3256480	3259480	That's why he didn't need to get a tour or anything.
3259480	3261480	He just walked up the White House steps.
3261480	3264480	Was that RDJ down there?
3264480	3265480	That was my president.
3265480	3270480	Speaking of which, somebody requested your Obama, if you want to.
3270480	3273480	We'll do the scene where I'm Robert Downey Jr.
3273480	3275480	Obama wasn't president during that moment.
3275480	3276480	Right.
3276480	3277480	Yeah.
3277480	3279480	That wouldn't work.
3279480	3292480	Well, he finds Obama in a cafe who's going over his presidential nomination forms.
3292480	3294480	And yeah.
3294480	3301480	Mr. President, I mean, I'm going to jump in the gun there a little bit, aren't you?
3302480	3304480	Do you mind if I sit down?
3304480	3309480	My name is Robert Downey Jr.
3309480	3311480	Well, it's a free country.
3311480	3317480	And quite frankly, I'm not going to pretend that I don't know who you are.
3317480	3325480	I'm going to sit on the chair by turning it around and straddling it just to add some energy.
3325480	3326480	Here's the deal.
3326480	3329480	9-11 is going to happen.
3329480	3332480	The date?
3332480	3335480	Or is there some new band that I'm not familiar with?
3335480	3338480	There's going to be some planes, and they're going to harm it.
3338480	3340480	You know, 3-11 is bad enough.
3340480	3341480	But if you're going to...
3359480	3366480	On 9-11, it all happens on 9-11.
3366480	3370480	What I've got to do is get to my people.
3370480	3373480	And we've got to come up with a policy for this.
3373480	3377480	And there are proper channels for making this happen.
3377480	3379480	Just as long as you stop 9-11.
3379480	3380480	That's all I care about.
3380480	3383480	I'll see you later.
3383480	3385480	Well, you sure you don't want to...
3385480	3387480	Oh, all right.
3388480	3393480	I mean, I had a couple of these danishes, and certainly I can only get through half of them.
3393480	3395480	But there it goes.
3395480	3400480	Just stop 9-11, future president.
3400480	3403480	I got five minutes left in 1999.
3403480	3406480	Maybe I should go...
3406480	3408480	You know what? I don't know if you like steak.
3408480	3409480	Oh.
3409480	3413480	But while you're here, there's a five-minute steak place that's around the corner.
3413480	3416480	All right. Well, I'll probably get to watch them make it.
3416480	3418480	But then I've got to go.
3421480	3424480	Doggy bag. I can take a...
3424480	3427480	Is the steak better in 1999 than it ever will be?
3427480	3430480	It'd be ten years old. It would be eight.
3430480	3432480	It'd be a seared Kobe beef.
3432480	3436480	A mix of green peppers and black peppers.
3436480	3439480	When do people start fucking?
3439480	3443480	I somehow lost my hashtag search.
3443480	3445480	All right.
3446480	3451480	Based on Dan's Michael Caine impression campaign to get him into the trip three.
3451480	3453480	I don't know what that means.
3453480	3456480	Too pop-cultural. I don't like pop-cultural references.
3456480	3459480	They both do very funny Michael Caine impressions and that.
3459480	3461480	It's very good.
3461480	3463480	The end.
3463480	3466480	Please fix the red cup in the ice bucket.
3466480	3468480	My OCD can't take it.
3468480	3473480	I mean, OCD doesn't mean you can't handle things being at an angle.
3473480	3478480	There's no proper way for a cup to be.
3478480	3482480	Don't blame that on OCD, you crazy person.
3485480	3489480	I was going to tweet asking if there's spare vodka, but my phone ran out of battery.
3489480	3492480	Oh, yeah. I can't.
3492480	3493480	Help yourself.
3493480	3494480	No, it's okay. It's okay.
3494480	3495480	No, no. Help yourself.
3495480	3497480	I just don't want to dig in the ice with my hand.
3497480	3498480	Your manners.
3498480	3499480	What?
3499480	3501480	Your manners, sir.
3502480	3506480	I'm trying not to, I don't want to touch your ice.
3506480	3509480	It's good manners if you think about it.
3509480	3511480	All right.
3511480	3514480	Are you two good friends? Have you known each other for a long time?
3514480	3515480	Yeah.
3515480	3516480	Where'd you guys grow up?
3516480	3517480	Tucson.
3517480	3518480	Oh, yeah?
3518480	3519480	Yeah.
3522480	3525480	Yeah, but we're like the friends that hate each other, too.
3525480	3526480	Why's that?
3526480	3527480	I don't know.
3527480	3529480	She's really funny.
3530480	3531480	She's so funny.
3531480	3532480	I know.
3532480	3535480	But I don't know.
3535480	3536480	Really, don't you have that, though?
3536480	3540480	Everybody has that friend that they really love, but they also kind of hate sometimes?
3540480	3541480	Like a frenemy?
3541480	3542480	No.
3544480	3547480	Maybe if you go on a staycation together.
3549480	3551480	On vanilla day.
3553480	3558480	Levi wants to know, how does Jerry McSeinfeld feel about the potato shortage?
3559480	3560480	Ahem.
3564480	3565480	How come?
3565480	3567480	It's got to be a potato shortage.
3567480	3570480	Why can't it be a tall edge?
3570480	3571480	All right.
3572480	3573480	Thank you.
3573480	3574480	Thank you.
3574480	3575480	Thank you.
3576480	3578480	Thank Jeff for Teen Wolf.
3578480	3579480	Okay.
3579480	3581480	It's my best work.
3581480	3587480	This guy says, I have bone conduction speakers you can try fourth row.
3587480	3588480	Really?
3589480	3590480	Wow.
3591480	3592480	Bring him to Jeff.
3592480	3594480	Let Jeff try him.
3594480	3596480	What kind of bone?
3598480	3600480	What goes on here?
3600480	3602480	It's a Google Glass.
3602480	3603480	Cool.
3603480	3604480	Right?
3605480	3606480	Oh, wow.
3606480	3612480	Tap the side and go to a video of Dan rapping or something.
3618480	3619480	What?
3624480	3625480	What am I supposed to do?
3626480	3627480	Oh.
3628480	3629480	Right now I just turn it off.
3630480	3631480	Tap it again.
3631480	3633480	Okay, glass.
3633480	3634480	Record video.
3634480	3636480	This is wild.
3636480	3637480	I didn't know the Goog-
3637480	3639480	It's doing whatever you told it to.
3639480	3640480	Okay, so it's recording a video.
3640480	3641480	Yeah.
3641480	3644480	So if I talk real loud right now and then it'll do 10 seconds and then it'll stop.
3644480	3645480	Okay.
3645480	3650480	And then if you replay the video then it'll come out a speaker here on the side.
3650480	3651480	Okay, that's 10 seconds.
3651480	3652480	All right.
3652480	3653480	Oh, I heard that.
3653480	3654480	So now tap it.
3654480	3657480	Yeah, tap it to hit play and it'll say play video.
3657480	3658480	Shit.
3659480	3660480	And it'll play video.
3660480	3661480	Play?
3661480	3662480	Yeah, hit play.
3662480	3667480	And then the way you can tell it's bone conduction is when it's playing if you push this against
3667480	3672480	your skull it'll get louder or if you close your ears like this then it gets louder because
3672480	3674480	it's making your head vibrate.
3674480	3675480	I don't hear a shit.
3675480	3676480	I see you moving.
3676480	3681480	You also might have heard these aren't that popular and people think-
3681480	3692480	Theoretically that's how it works.
3692480	3695480	I mean I felt like an enormous piece by the way.
3695480	3696480	Yeah.
3696480	3697480	That's his primary purpose.
3697480	3698480	Terminator.
3698480	3699480	What is your name?
3699480	3700480	Daniel.
3700480	3701480	Come on Daniel.
3701480	3702480	Thank you very much.
3702480	3707480	Come on Daniel with the now discontinued Google Glass.
3707480	3715480	So when you get the Google Glass, is the bone conducting speakers like an option?
3715480	3717480	Like a sunroof on a car?
3717480	3718480	No, it's mandatory.
3718480	3719480	Oh, okay.
3719480	3722480	And it really sounds like-
3722480	3728480	It's normal speakers and if you're at a concert and you're listening to it you can plug your
3729480	3732480	ears and you can like if you're having a phone conversation with someone and then you can
3732480	3737480	hear it even though there's loud things around you because it's going through your head.
3737480	3738480	Interesting.
3738480	3739480	Yeah.
3739480	3743480	The brunette to your left, the redhead or the black eye.
3743480	3752480	F murder kill go.
3753480	3762480	I wandered into that.
3762480	3765480	Look, I'm not allowed.
3765480	3770480	I took vows that preclude me from playing murder kill ever again.
3770480	3774480	I'll save it for you.
3774480	3776480	Murder and kill are the same thing.
3776480	3777480	Oh, Mary.
3777480	3778480	Mary.
3778480	3779480	It's Mary.
3779480	3780480	Oh, Mary.
3780480	3781480	That's probably her.
3781480	3782480	Oh, man.
3782480	3783480	I don't care.
3783480	3784480	I don't know where to live.
3784480	3785480	All right.
3785480	3786480	It's great.
3786480	3787480	It's all about the shirt.
3787480	3788480	Oh, I didn't mean to make this dark.
3788480	3791480	Yeah, that didn't seem like a sincere threat or anything.
3791480	3792480	All right.
3792480	3799480	Well, let's- why don't we thank these young ladies and get them out of here?
3799480	3805480	Thank you, Angela and Laura.
3805480	3806480	Thanks, ladies.
3806480	3809480	Thanks for your Fifty Shades of Grey report.
3809480	3811480	And they added some energy, right?
3811480	3812480	Yeah.
3812480	3813480	Right.
3813480	3814480	Yeah.
3814480	3815480	All right.
3815480	3819480	This show isn't free fall right now, man.
3819480	3820480	9-11!
3820480	3824480	Oh!
3824480	3827480	We should do something every 9-11.
3827480	3829480	All right.
3829480	3831480	I'm always going to notice it.
3831480	3833480	So what do we do every 9-11?
3833480	3834480	What?
3834480	3835480	Make a wish.
3835480	3836480	Make a wish.
3837480	3844480	If you use that wish for anything other than there to be no more 9-11s, you're an asshole,
3844480	3845480	right?
3845480	3848480	I would like you to do it every 9-11.
3848480	3852480	I want you to go into some sort of weird Michael Caine scene.
3852480	3853480	I'll say it.
3853480	3854480	I'll say it.
3854480	3855480	I'll say it.
3855480	3856480	I'll say it.
3856480	3857480	I'll say it.
3857480	3858480	I'll say it.
3858480	3859480	I'll say it.
3859480	3860480	I'll say it.
3860480	3861480	I'll say it.
3861480	3862480	I'll say it.
3862480	3863480	I'll say it.
3863480	3864480	I'll say it.
3864480	3865480	I'll say it.
3865480	3866480	I'll say it.
3866480	3867480	I'll say it.
3867480	3868480	You can't say it again in a love scene.
3868480	3869480	I love you!
3869480	3870480	Thank you.
3870480	3871480	Michael, let's do it again but a little more romantic this time.
3871480	3872480	All right.
3872480	3873480	I bloody love you!
3873480	3874480	Who's that comic?
3874480	3875480	Weoglobinout.
3875480	3878480	Is Rob Schwab in the house?
3878480	3883100	No, you'd hear his dumb laugh.
3883100	3886040	He has to get prepped to shoot the Matt Berry episode.
3886040	3887800	Take her off the pants.
3887800	3888880	What do you have to lose?
3888880	3892800	I'll tell you what I have to lose.
3892800	3893680	The secret of my sk 10 mark.
3893680	3894680	It's whatever.
3894680	3904680	I'm pretty certain that it'll be gross if I take off my pants.
3904680	3905680	What sort of underwear do you wear?
3905680	3906680	You're a tidy whitey guy?
3906680	3907680	What do you got?
3907680	3908680	Boxers?
3908680	3909680	What do you wear?
3909680	3910680	I can't remember.
3910680	3911680	They're like boxer briefs, I guess.
3911680	3914680	You can't remember the underwear you wear.
3914680	3923680	Because I put them on, like, you know, each pair is like three weeks, so, you know, I
3924680	3931680	just throw them in the garbage and buy a new pack.
3931680	3938280	We're so different.
3938280	3940880	What does the Latin on the Harmon Town sign mean?
3940880	3946680	I think it means we found a city without tyranny.
3946680	3953680	We write in Latin without understanding.
3953680	3956680	You're welcome.
3956680	3960680	It's Caesar back there.
3960680	3961680	Jeff rap, please.
3961680	3962680	NBA rap?
3962680	3963680	NBA rap.
3963680	3964680	Yeah, you don't like the NBA?
3964680	3965680	You racist, bro?
3965680	3966680	I used to like the NBA.
3966680	3967680	I grew up as a Laker fan, man.
3967680	3968680	It was awesome.
3968680	3969680	Well, then do an NBA rap.
3969680	3970680	This person asked for it.
3970680	3971680	Lakers!
3971680	3972680	Lakers!
3973680	3979680	Going down the court wearing Afros and shorts that are short.
3986680	3987680	Oh, I've got skills.
3987680	3992680	This guy, Aaron Nelson, says he needs to write a 9-11 song for us to play and sing along
3992680	3993680	to at 9-11.
3993680	3994680	That would be a good thing.
3994680	3995680	Okay.
3995680	3996680	Every 9-11.
3996680	3997680	But, you know, don't make it.
3997680	3998680	Well, I don't know.
3998680	3999680	I'm not going to say don't make it whatever.
3999680	4003680	I mean, it'll be perceived as offensive if that's how you want to perceive it.
4003680	4004680	But I think we should...
4004680	4007680	It'll be a solemn moment.
4007680	4009680	9-11, obviously.
4009680	4011680	It refers to a national tragedy.
4011680	4015680	And then we'll do something with that moment, to this guy's music, maybe.
4015680	4016680	We'll try that.
4016680	4019680	Can I guest Dungeon Master?
4019680	4022680	Are you here, this person that asked us?
4022680	4023680	Yeah.
4023680	4024680	How would you do that?
4024680	4025680	Improv.
4025680	4031680	We're going to put a pin in that.
4031680	4037680	In the realm of ideas of that quality, this person says, bring Adam Goldberg up.
4037680	4040680	I don't think there's any way he could be here.
4040680	4043680	He'll materialize.
4043680	4044680	This would have been a...
4044680	4046680	It's like Candyman.
4046680	4050680	Historically, he's made his presence known already if he's here, right?
4050680	4051680	Yeah.
4051680	4053680	Oh, give something away at 9-11, this person suggests.
4053680	4054680	That's a good idea.
4054680	4062680	We auction him off at 9-11.
4062680	4066680	On the other side of the spectrum, this person's saying, play Jenga at 9-11.
4066680	4067680	Yeah.
4067680	4068680	Yeah.
4068680	4069680	Bad person.
4069680	4070680	You're a bad person.
4070680	4071680	Do you hear that?
4071680	4080680	Hear what you do to people when you think?
4080680	4081680	I just tuned in.
4081680	4091680	What the hell is going on?
4091680	4094680	What was the last movie you saw?
4094680	4097680	Did you say Monuments Men?
4097680	4099680	Well, I tried to watch at Nightcrawler.
4099680	4100680	I kept falling asleep.
4100680	4104680	I was really into it, but just very sleepy.
4104680	4108680	I really want to finish watching Nightcrawler, but I keep falling asleep.
4108680	4109680	Nightcrawler's awesome.
4109680	4110680	You ever going to write a movie?
4110680	4111680	We've talked about this before.
4111680	4120680	Yeah, I just got to write a bad enough season of Community that they stop making me do more.
4120680	4123680	And then I'm going to write on those movies.
4123680	4127680	I think you should write your 9-11 movie.
4127680	4132680	Wait, what is this Dan Harmon potato shortage is now showing up as a trending hashtag next to Chevy Chase?
4132680	4133680	Not really.
4133680	4134680	Oh, shit.
4134680	4135680	It's just in Chicago.
4135680	4136680	That makes sense.
4136680	4138680	It's an improvised podcast.
4138680	4146680	Yeah, Chevy did the SNL thing tonight.
4146680	4147680	He made an appearance.
4147680	4148680	I saw that on Twitter.
4148680	4153680	And so did Eddie Murphy, who long has not appeared near SNL.
4153680	4156680	Wasn't he kind of banned from it or something like that?
4156680	4161680	I think it was more like, was he banned or was he like the other way around?
4161680	4163680	Like he wouldn't go.
4163680	4165680	I don't know.
4165680	4166680	Who knows?
4166680	4167680	All right.
4167680	4168680	Well, okay.
4168680	4169680	That was Twitter interaction.
4169680	4170680	Kind of hot, huh?
4170680	4172680	I mean, it kind of works.
4172680	4175680	Like imagine if I didn't have to look at my phone.
4175680	4183680	The applause was so sad.
4183680	4189680	I think that if we had like a little monitor down there and then we could see it or you could curate it.
4189680	4190680	You're the comptroller.
4190680	4191680	Right.
4191680	4195680	All right.
4195680	4196680	Well, it is hot up here.
4196680	4201680	So I might as well just it just feels I mean, it's like somebody, somebody, somebody tweeted a picture.
4201680	4206680	I know what I look like.
4206680	4210680	It's a woman I love that married this.
4210680	4222680	She has to look at this tonight after watching Fifty Shades of Grey.
4222680	4227680	You better buy a lot of pizza.
4227680	4228680	All right.
4228680	4233680	Have you ever done any bondage, sadal masochism stuff?
4233680	4235680	You guys ever do like kinky shit?
4235680	4236680	You guys me and Aaron?
4236680	4237680	Yeah.
4237680	4239680	Or previous gals or?
4239680	4241680	When I was younger, because I thought you had to try everything.
4241680	4250680	I tried all the, you know, I tried a little bit of tying somebody, you know, down.
4251680	4253680	I'm like, okay, now you're tied down.
4253680	4261680	I mean, kind of felt like you were obligated to stay here before that.
4261680	4269680	Like social anxieties are more, more, more pressing to me than like my dad's neckties.
4269680	4271680	Were you ever tied up?
4271680	4272680	Did you ever get tied down?
4272680	4274680	I think, I think we took turns.
4274680	4277680	This is when I was like young enough that I was like, well, let's do that.
4277680	4280680	And then also I was like, oh, let's get the food.
4280680	4281680	Let's do the food.
4281680	4283680	This is the dumbest.
4283680	4287680	You see people in the movies with the food, with the whipped cream.
4287680	4288680	And it's just like, why?
4288680	4291680	This is sticky and gross.
4291680	4294680	Now it's more like hot dairy products.
4294680	4296680	That's gross.
4296680	4301680	Sex is pretty dumb.
4301680	4306680	I mean, the people that enjoy it, like they don't stop doing it.
4306680	4314680	They like have to keep doing it, which is a good sign that it's dumb, right?
4314680	4319680	Like it's not, it's not like they can do it for like, and then, oh, hey, Marissa.
4319680	4326680	I didn't know you were in town.
4326680	4329680	This is a stranger show.
4329680	4330680	That's Marissa.
4330680	4342680	She does the, she hosts, has created the having changed Tumblr blog, which has been up since
4342680	4344680	the start of this podcast really, right?
4344680	4348680	Because I made some comment about how there's no Tumblr blogs about me and then you made
4348680	4349680	one.
4349680	4351680	And she's been in our corner ever since.
4351680	4358680	She was at our wedding.
4358680	4360680	So what other kind of food did you guys do?
4360680	4361680	Whipped cream?
4361680	4362680	What else?
4362680	4363680	I had whipped cream and chocolate sauce or some sugar.
4363680	4366680	I just remember whipped cream and like, I think maybe honey.
4366680	4367680	I can't remember.
4367680	4372680	The only thing I remember is it being just dumb.
4372680	4374680	It's like sex.
4374680	4383680	You know, sex is something that you do with someone you love because, you know, the alternative
4384680	4399680	is masturbating, which is an exclusive act, an exclusionary, it's a bad message to send.
4399680	4407680	So you invite the other person in.
4407680	4416680	Let's do this together.
4416680	4434680	And then every once in a while, a little, a new life is created by this act.
4435680	4443680	That person germinates in the uterus.
4443680	4455680	Is extracted from it, placed on a stainless steel scale, given a barcode, sent home after
4455680	4465680	several vaccinations, which, whoa.
4465680	4473680	And then 18 years later, it goes to work at Verizon.
4473680	4475680	And so does she.
4475680	4477680	Oh, that special someone.
4477680	4480680	And then they go.
4480680	4488680	And then Verizon keeps growing.
4488680	4490680	It's a great species.
4490680	4492680	It's really fun.
4492680	4496680	I'm sure Fifty Shades of Grey really put the magic back in it.
4496680	4499680	Did you ever, like, dress up or do any, like, costumes or stuff like that?
4499680	4500680	Dress up.
4500680	4508680	Well, I mean, yeah, I guess, well, like, not like a panda or anything.
4508680	4509680	I don't know.
4509680	4511680	I mean, I'm 42 years old.
4511680	4515680	I've tried everything once.
4515680	4521680	Somebody's bone conductor's turned off.
4521680	4524680	Yeah, I've tried everything once.
4524680	4525680	Yeah?
4525680	4526680	Yeah.
4526680	4527680	Once.
4527680	4528680	Gangbang?
4528680	4529680	Not scat play.
4529680	4530680	No, no, no.
4530680	4532680	I haven't done pee and poop and...
4532680	4534680	Yeah, the pee and the poo and the blood thing is not for me.
4534680	4536680	I don't need any of that in my life.
4536680	4537680	I mean, I haven't tried everything.
4537680	4539680	Yeah, that's silly for me to say.
4539680	4544680	I've tried everything like a normal person, like, like, like, consider, like, like, like,
4544680	4548680	this is like three things.
4548680	4551680	It's like 900 things I haven't tried.
4551680	4553680	I haven't put a toe in my butt.
4553680	4556680	That's the...
4556680	4560680	And you could do all 10 toes and that's 10 things I haven't done.
4560680	4562680	You put a sharpie up your butt?
4562680	4567680	Mm-hmm.
4567680	4570680	Yeah, I did.
4570680	4575680	Mask work.
4575680	4578680	How are we going to get through tonight?
4578680	4580680	How are we going to do a show?
4580680	4582680	Are we warmed up yet?
4582680	4583680	I'm warm.
4583680	4588680	My shaking has stopped.
4588680	4590680	Oh, that's my post supervisor.
4590680	4594680	He's canceling the, uh, canceling post tomorrow.
4594680	4597680	He's probably figured out I'm not going to be editing.
4597680	4600680	Yeah, I'll have to be writing.
4600680	4606680	Thank you.
4606680	4611680	Sorry, I'm on stage.
4611680	4612680	Okay.
4612680	4613680	There we go.
4613680	4615680	Post super.
4615680	4621680	Podcast gold.
4621680	4628680	Do you guys have any Minecraft questions?
4628680	4630680	What mod am I running?
4630680	4633680	I'm running a mod pack called Feed the Beast Infinity.
4633680	4637680	It's available at FeedTheBeast.com.
4637680	4639680	It's called the Infinity Mod Pack.
4639680	4640680	It's brand new.
4640680	4644680	It's 1.7, and, uh, it's, uh, it's very stable.
4644680	4647680	And, uh, it has Applied Energistics 2 in it,
4647680	4649680	which I've been looking forward to for a while,
4649680	4651680	and I've just gotten on my feet with that,
4651680	4654680	and I'm having a real good time.
4654680	4657680	It's a very balanced mod pack, very balanced.
4657680	4659680	Previous mod packs have done strange things,
4659680	4661680	experimental things, like you have magical crops added,
4661680	4663680	and now you can grow everything.
4663680	4665680	Like, you don't even have to do anything else.
4665680	4667680	This is a good mod pack.
4667680	4669680	How many hours do you spend playing that?
4669680	4672680	I don't know.
4672680	4673680	I don't know.
4673680	4674680	Well, I can't these days.
4674680	4677680	I mean, maybe on the weekend, like, I'll just sit
4677680	4679680	as long as my body will let me.
4679680	4683680	I, like, if I, if it's not Valentine's Day
4683680	4686680	and I, like, it's a weekend, I'll,
4686680	4687680	and I don't have something to write,
4687680	4690680	I will get up and I'll grab the laptop and be like,
4690680	4694680	Grr, Minecraft.
4698680	4700680	All right.
4700680	4702680	Let's figure something out.
4705680	4708680	Do you have any music on there that's, like, not rap?
4708680	4709680	Yeah.
4709680	4711680	Like, branch out?
4711680	4714680	Yeah, let's try, let's go do this.
4721680	4728680	When you move, move, move your body to the beat
4730680	4736680	When you see, see, see everybody in the street
4739680	4743680	You got the action, I got the water
4743680	4749680	We'll put them both in a cup with our daughter, family
4749680	4753680	Family on the street with a bucket and a cup
4753680	4757680	Doing everything, what's up, family
4757680	4761680	Family on the street tonight with a bucket and a cup
4761680	4763680	What's up, bucket, bucket
4763680	4766680	Yo, yo, yo, my name is MC John
4766680	4768680	I'm here to mow the lawn
4768680	4772680	I'd like to use a rake, but that grass will not take
4772680	4774680	I gotta get up on the riding mower
4774680	4776680	So faster, don't go slower
4776680	4778680	Mow around the trees and yard
4778680	4780680	I fucked your mama hard
4780680	4785680	I want to see you next big day night
4788680	4793680	I don't want to get into a fight
4793680	4795680	Yeah, don't get in a fight, baby
4796680	4801680	Cause you are my family and I love you
4802680	4804680	So you want
4805680	4810680	I won't steal your socks or your shoes
4811680	4812680	Family
4813680	4817680	Cause you got what I need
4821680	4822680	Family
4825680	4826680	That's good
4827680	4828680	That was a good one
4832680	4833680	That was a good song
4833680	4837680	I like the fascinating character of DJ John
4839680	4841680	I'm here to mow the lawn
4842680	4850680	DJ John was a refreshing departure from the profane evolution of rap
4850680	4854680	He was back to a traditional peas and carrots kind of rap
4854680	4858680	But right at the end he let you know
4858680	4860680	He's fucking your mom
4860680	4863680	Which makes sense because listening to him
4863680	4866680	I don't think he knew that much about lawn care
4868680	4871680	He wanted to use a rake
4871680	4872680	That's a MacGuffin
4878680	4882680	Who wrote some of this music? Do we have to give credit to these people?
4882680	4885680	That is by Kevin MacLeod
4885680	4887680	Remember Kevin
4887680	4889680	If you call my name
4891680	4892680	Are you Highlander reference?
4892680	4893680	Yeah, yes
4893680	4894680	Kevin MacLeod
4895680	4897680	Don't forget, Kevin
4897680	4898680	We're from an alien planet
4898680	4899680	What?
4900680	4901680	Highlander 2
4902680	4903680	Fucked up
4904680	4905680	Fucked up sequel
4906680	4911680	They reveal at the beginning of Highlander 2 that all of the things that happened in Highlander 1
4911680	4914680	Were in a different framework
4914680	4915680	They were aliens
4916680	4918680	They just forgot that they were aliens
4919680	4921680	And then they remember
4921680	4923680	And then Sean Connery says remember
4923680	4926680	Also don't forget that if you call my name I'll come back to life
4927680	4928680	So he does
4928680	4929680	And Sean Connery comes back to life
4929680	4932680	But Sean Connery spends the entire movie buying clothes

5096680	5097680	That's what I'm asking
5097680	5099680	Ding dong, ding a loo dang dong
5099680	5102680	I set the grandfather clock on the wall
5102680	5105680	I'm not getting any sleep at all

5156680	5158680	The whole time
5167680	5169680	Thanks guys, thanks
5170680	5174680	That was really nice, I was kind of hoping DJ John made an appearance
5177680	5179680	There's a whole, I mean, I'm like
5179680	5183680	This is like a whole sesame street of characters you've got going on
5185680	5188680	I think we should explore that town a little bit more
5188680	5191680	I'd like to know everybody that lives in that building
5191680	5193680	The whole block
5194680	5198680	Yeah, all right, well, what else you got?
5210680	5213680	None of them, none of them knew what time it was
5214680	5216680	Didn't know what to do
5221680	5223680	Are they brothers or were they best friends?
5223680	5225680	They were friends, they were in the basement
5225680	5228680	The mom was coming down and then she went back up to her husband
5230680	5234680	I think there was something going on between the mom and the friend
5239680	5240680	Well
5243680	5251680	This feels like cold open, like crawl music maybe going on
5254680	5256680	Vincent Press?
5256680	5259680	In the age of innocence
5261680	5266680	There is a prophecy that one will come
5266680	5271680	Who will change the innocence to guilt
5274680	5282680	The keepers of this prophecy are called the star walkers
5282680	5284680	Star walkers
5285680	5292680	Reclusive by nature, they keep to a hallowed hall atop the trees
5298680	5300680	Of Wisconsin
5301680	5303680	Wisconsin
5306680	5311680	We join them now at breakfast
5315680	5317680	Do you want more eggs?
5320680	5322680	Star walker
5324680	5327680	I have not satiated my taste for eggs
5328680	5330680	I would like another egg
5331680	5334680	I will make you one more egg
5335680	5339680	The time keepers, sky walkers, sir
5340680	5342680	What were they called?
5342680	5344680	Star walkers
5348680	5352680	Sea eggs is the center of all power
5353680	5355680	All power
5356680	5357680	Here is yours
5357680	5360680	I scrambled it, I tried to make it sunny side up
5361680	5363680	Then it became scrambled
5364680	5370680	Let me put my hand to it and draw from it its essence with my mind
5371680	5373680	Since the beginning of time
5375680	5378680	The sky guardians, what were they called?
5378680	5380680	Star walkers
5381680	5386680	Have derived their nutrition manually
5387680	5392680	Preferring to save the mouth for verbal communication
5396680	5399680	What say you of the prophecy?
5402680	5405680	There will be three leaves in this tree
5405680	5407680	All three will fall
5408680	5410680	Only one will land
5414680	5418680	Father, you are up early
5422680	5424680	There is a man on the lawn
5434680	5436680	He's got a rake
5438680	5442680	He just seems to be fiddling around out there
5445680	5450680	Be calm my young one, I will see what this is about
5463680	5465680	You there
5466680	5469680	You are tending the lawn?
5472680	5473680	Yes
5475680	5477680	My name is John
5485680	5487680	I prefer a rake
5488680	5491680	If that's what it take
5496680	5499680	But I mow the grass
5501680	5503680	Like your mama's ass
5508680	5510680	Your mama's ass
5512680	5514680	My name is John
5515680	5517680	Mom fucker
5518680	5520680	I'm here to say
5521680	5525680	I fucked so many moms today
5531680	5533680	I fucked them in the east
5537680	5540680	I fucked them in the south
5542680	5544680	Three hours later
5544680	5546680	In the mouth
5547680	5550680	I have never heard of this practice
5559680	5564680	I am a star walker
5566680	5568680	Well I'm coming up
5568680	5570680	You're not supposed to
5570680	5572680	I'm coming up
5573680	5575680	Get off the ladder
5575680	5578680	Give me the bucket of lava
5596680	5598680	He's not slowing down
5599680	5601680	He's a skeleton
5606680	5608680	He's a flaming skeleton
5614680	5616680	My name is John
5620680	5622680	Run, run to the panic room
5624680	5625680	Does it work?
5625680	5626680	Do they fix it?
5626680	5628680	Get in the panic room
5633680	5634680	Jesus
5635680	5637680	This is a difficult sort
5638680	5640680	And you said no panic room
5641680	5643680	You said let's go to Cancun
5645680	5647680	Turn that money into fun you said
5649680	5652680	One person in this treetop thinks about our safety
5653680	5656680	The prophecy said three leaves would fall
5657680	5659680	We three should jump
5660680	5662680	And leave him here
5667680	5668680	Okay
5669680	5671680	I fear only one of us will make it
5673680	5676680	And so it is I take this time to say goodbye
5677680	5680680	You're going out the window of the panic room
5683680	5685680	The ill-advised window
5686680	5688680	Panic room window
5688680	5690680	I wanted to see
5690680	5692680	You guys don't even lock that window
5692680	5694680	It defeats the whole point of having a panic room
5695680	5696680	Who's that?
5696680	5698680	Father it's me, don't be alone
5699680	5702680	The panic room needs sunlight you said
5702680	5704680	Fine, great
5704680	5706680	Alright, so the three of us jump
5707680	5710680	Ahh! Sorry, sorry
5711680	5712680	Alright
5713680	5715680	It is said in the Skywalker tradition
5716680	5717680	Skywalker
5720680	5722680	One need not fear death
5723680	5725680	For death is only the beginning
5726680	5727680	But that day
5728680	5730680	As my toes perched
5730680	5733680	On the wooden sill of my panic room window
5734680	5738680	Arms outstretched like a bold but fearful crane
5739680	5744680	I tasted what God must have felt the day he gave us life
5745680	5750680	The fear that it was all for nothing
5750680	5751680	Nothing
5763680	5764680	Nothing
5775680	5777680	Well my name is John
5777680	5779680	I was a skeleton all along
5779680	5781680	I wanted to take over the house
5781680	5783680	Now I got it all to myself
5783680	5785680	I got a rake over here and a shovel over there
5785680	5787680	I can do long care all day
5787680	5789680	I don't even have to rhyme anymore
5789680	5791680	I'm just Big Bad John and I got my own home
5791680	5793680	I'm gonna sit down on the couch
5793680	5795680	Gonna make myself at home
5795680	5797680	I'm a burnt skeleton because they poured lava on me
5797680	5799680	This is what I deserve
5799680	5800680	My name is John
5800680	5801680	My name is John
5801680	5804680	I'm walking all in long day
5804680	5806680	Hop hop to the hip to the hop hop
5806680	5808680	Hip hop to hip hop
5808680	5809680	My name is John
5809680	5810680	I do your lawn
5810680	5812680	But I don't take no shit today
5812680	5813680	Hip hop to the happy day hop
5813680	5815680	I said to hop hop to the hop
5815680	5816680	About hop hop
5816680	5818680	Did you ever see a White House
5818680	5820680	With a President in it?
5820680	5822680	Fuck that motherfucker
5822680	5824680	I'll fuck the government
5824680	5826680	Fuck your government
5826680	5828680	My name is John
5828680	5830680	Big Bad John all day long
5830680	5831680	Take care of your lawn
5831680	5832680	Ding dong ding dong
5832680	5834680	I take your daisies down
5834680	5836680	To a regular town
5836680	5838680	And I sell them at the bazaar
5838680	5840680	I drive back in my car
5840680	5841680	It's powered by the sun
5841680	5843680	Green energy
5843680	5845680	Fuck the President
5845680	5847680	My name is John
5847680	5849680	All day long
5849680	5851680	Oh
5876680	5878680	Father are you okay?
5878680	5880680	Ow
5880680	5882680	My back is broken
5882680	5884680	Would you perhaps like some eggs?
5887680	5889680	Ow am I the only one that got hurt?
5891680	5892680	I walked down
5894680	5896680	There's a what? There's a stairs?
5896680	5898680	John was just on the couch rapping
5898680	5899680	He didn't even see me
5905680	5907680	He was getting really irritable about the government
5907680	5908680	He was kind of like
5912680	5915680	Father I'll go to the I'll go to the medicine tree
5916680	5921680	Did any of you ever think that we've done all we've done for nothing?
5922680	5923680	Yes
5924680	5925680	But
5926680	5931680	One must understand that it is all a process of becoming
5932680	5937680	And whether you're in your panic window panicking
5938680	5942680	Whether you're in the air flying and dying and landing
5942680	5944680	And whether you're the clever sun
5946680	5948680	Cascading down a flight of stairs
5948680	5952680	Made more stable by lava that has now ceased to be lava
5952680	5956680	And is merely igneous
5956680	5957680	Father Father
5957680	5958680	And substantial
5959680	5960680	Uncle Rico, sorry to interrupt
5960680	5962680	I'm getting a reading on the radar
5964680	5967680	It appears to be some sort of spacecraft coming inbound
5971680	5973680	It is the elder
5978680	5981680	How the mighty have fallen
5982680	5984680	Expecting to see an elder?
5985680	5986680	It's me
5987680	5989680	Tom Young
5995680	5997680	Too fat from living in your trees
5998680	5999680	Living your dreams
6000680	6003680	Did a rapping lawn man make you fall?
6004680	6006680	I told you there was war in this universe
6006680	6008680	And you've refused to heed my call
6009680	6011680	Now you lay on the floor with the rest of the animals
6011680	6013680	Clutching at your broken back
6013680	6015680	Waiting for medicine trees
6017680	6019680	The medicine has gone to the front
6020680	6023680	Gird your loins and join the war or perish here
6027680	6029680	Fuck! God damn it
6037680	6040680	That was just a cameo, I guess
6042680	6044680	Is he coming back, Father?
6047680	6049680	Well, what have we here?
6050680	6054680	The elders struck down like animals from their pride atop the treetops
6056680	6059680	Wasn't so long ago you refused us food and weapons for our war
6064680	6066680	Jesus Christ, everyone hated us
6072680	6074680	Worm people
6077680	6080680	Worm people detect elders
6082680	6087680	How you've been stricken down to worm level
6088680	6090680	You should have helped us with our war
6091680	6092680	Oh, sorry.
6093680	6094680	Worm people theme
6097680	6100680	Underground, underground
6101680	6104680	Where the waters found moisture
6105680	6106680	Moisture?
6107680	6108680	Nutrients
6109680	6110680	Where did they went?
6111680	6114680	Have to find those nutrients before the rain drives us up
6115680	6119680	My mucous membrane protects my outer shell
6120680	6123680	I wriggle around, I do very well
6124680	6125680	I am a worm
6127680	6130680	And my worm culture will prevail
6134680	6135680	To talk
6135680	6136680	The worm wrapper
6136680	6137680	I'm a...
6138680	6139680	Rabbit
6139680	6141680	I'm a rabbit, rabbit, rabbit worm
6142680	6143680	Watch me squirm
6144680	6146680	Stop, no, what did I tell you?
6146680	6147680	Stop
6148680	6150680	You're a bad rabbit, rabbit
6151680	6152680	Go practice
6155680	6157680	Sun comes up, moon goes down
6158680	6159680	Everyone has worms around
6160680	6161680	We are everywhere
6162680	6164680	Our worm culture will prevail
6165680	6166680	Move through the dirt
6168680	6169680	Rumors I hurt

6256680	6261680	Father, I feel like the Starwalkers used to be a proud culture
6261680	6263680	But it seems like everybody kind of hates our guts
6263680	6265680	We've let a lot of people down
6265680	6268680	Wisdom brings its labor
6268680	6271680	There is a small place in the world
6271680	6274680	For ponderous people who look at eggs
6274680	6277680	And muse about the future
