0	24440	Oh, it's so nice to be back at Meltdown Comics, the nerd melt theater here in Hollywood, California.
24440	32880	Our triumphant return, back to our cozy little nest in our loyal harmonians.
32880	37560	We've been all over the country, I'm not sure what we've learned, but I do know that it's
37560	41480	very nice to be sitting here again with you people.
41480	45320	Harman Town is finally back in session in Hollywood, California.
45320	60240	Put your hands together for the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
60240	71000	Yo, yo, yo.
71000	74360	I may be wrapped out, I don't know.
75360	78720	Fuck you guys that applauded.
78720	83160	I'm a wrapped master, that's why I'm wrapped out, because I perfected the art, not because
83160	86920	it was obnoxious and tiresome.
86920	93960	It is really, really oddly comfortable to be back, it's really weird.
93960	99080	We tried to take this shot, Neil, the guy doing the documentary, wanted to do this shot
99080	103880	where I would walk down the sidewalk outside nerd melt, walk through the door into an empty
103880	107600	comic book store, just keep walking, and then it would be perfectly timed with Jeff
107600	111800	bringing me up, so it would be like a, you know, a, a, a, just a-
111800	113680	Did I fuck it up?
113680	117080	I don't know, I think, I don't know if you fucked it up, I have no idea, it's fucked
117080	118080	up.
118080	121080	Wait, wait, were you standing in the doorway for like ten seconds?
121080	122080	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
122080	123080	Oh shit.
123080	124080	I don't know what-
124080	125080	Should we try it again?
125080	126080	Well-
126080	129240	Go, go back outside.
129240	131040	Just yell at me, Neil.
131040	136760	This is the fucking bullshit.
136760	137760	Welcome home.
137760	150680	We're back, everybody, Meltdown Thomas in Hollywood, California, Herndon Town is once
150680	151680	again in session.
151680	170880	Put your hands together for the mayor of Herndon Town, Dan Herndon.
170880	171880	Oh.
171880	178720	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
178720	182560	I walked from the sidewalk to the back.
182560	184560	It was seamless.
184560	189080	Wow, Dan, Dan, where were you?
189080	190400	We missed you.
190400	192800	I was in the green room, you, you, you left for a while.
192800	197840	Jeff, I do what I always do before a show, I, I, I went and stood outside of 7-Eleven.
197840	202800	Wait, you, you climb up on top of the fire escape and stand there like Batman for a while.
202800	207920	I stare at my fist and talk about the darkness of the city and, and then when the mood takes
207920	211960	me I, I clamber down and I, I just make a beeline and I just, I just, I just hope to
211960	214600	God that you're starting the show at that particular time.
214600	217920	How, how could you possibly have any idea that I'm starting the show?
217920	222640	I'm doing that just hoping that you hear the, you hear that, that the frequency of audience
222640	223640	joy.
223640	227000	The truth is, Jeff, there are parallel universes where you're in the middle of introducing
227000	231120	the show and I just walk up and tell you to fuck off like I, I just interrupt you.
231120	232560	It's so we just got lucky once again.
232560	233560	Yeah.
233560	239240	Batman is a show that is not written, therefore it is written by God.
239240	242080	And he doesn't make mistakes.
242080	244920	You don't punch him up.
244920	245920	N-word.
245920	250800	He, his, his, his, his draft is final, man.
250800	254920	That's all you got to do is do nothing at all and you are doing the work of a master.
254920	263280	What if I get really serious about that and told you the good news and, uh, I am feeling
263280	264280	very spiritual lately.
264280	269160	I was going on the tour and also it's like, like, like I've started, I was a bad friend
269160	272520	for not listening to it in the first place, but I've been really, really diving into Duncan
272520	280800	Trussell, uh, uh, lately and he, he is amazing if you, uh, and I, every Lutheran bone in
280800	285560	my body, every superstitious fiber of my being makes me want to knock on every piece of wood
285560	291320	in the room and say, I, I, please, I, I, I, like, like, like, like the universe.
291320	296880	This isn't how it sounds, but in all seriousness, there's no other way to express this.
296880	301960	Like he makes testicular cancer sound fun.
301960	305600	Like he, like, like, like he, he's so fucking cool.
305600	308840	Like, like, like, like you just like, oh man, I could get cancer.
308840	309840	That'd be no problem.
309840	314400	Like, like you almost want to get it, like, like, like listening to him.
314400	319640	Cause he's so fucking, like, like, I think he puts a very beautiful, like heroic funny
319640	320640	face on it.
320640	322720	Like radiation's a giant bummer.
322720	324080	You wouldn't, you wouldn't last a minute.
324080	325080	And he doesn't know.
325080	328320	I wouldn't, I wouldn't at all know he doesn't deny any of that stuff though.
328320	330120	He doesn't say it's not a bummer.
330120	336600	He's he's very emphatic about, uh, you know, embracing also the pain of life and acknowledging
336600	337600	it for pain.
337600	339080	And that's what's so fucking cool about him.
339080	340080	God damn it.
340080	341080	I want to make love to him.
341080	342960	Uh, but let's do his podcast.
342960	343960	It's great.
343960	348080	He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a sister of harm and town sister podcast.
349080	352800	Uh, I'm going to get a drink.
352800	353800	What do you want to talk about?
353800	354800	Jeff?
354800	359160	Um, I want to talk about, I actually do have some questions because we came back and we
359160	362880	did this tour and there was an unanswered question that really, I mean, if you answered
362880	366800	it one on one with, uh, with the filmmakers, I wasn't there.
366800	370520	This seemed to be the, the eternally unanswered question of what the point of it all was.
370520	375280	And you said, you said that as you returned and you came back to LA at the big Egyptian
375280	377640	theater show that you learned nothing.
378200	382680	Um, cause I still hadn't, but I realized tonight in the green room, I actually finally figured
382680	383680	it out.
383680	386240	Like, and it's, it's the dumbest thing in the world cause it's right under your nose
386240	388160	and it's sort of so generic.
388160	393120	The entire time we were out there, we were doing these shows, we were doing performances.
393120	398120	Shows can be good or bad show performances are, are, are, you know, Oh, that was a good
398120	399120	show.
399120	400120	That was a bad show.
400120	401120	Oh, the show's not going so good.
401120	402720	Oh, you talked about Chevy chasing that show.
402720	404120	Oh, it's a season four premiere.
404120	405120	Was he going to talk about that?
405120	408800	Like, like, it was a performance, like, like it can go one way or another.
408800	413400	And so you're thinking about it as a performance beforehand, no matter how much you try to
413400	417280	not think about it, you know, and, and not, not pre-write anything and stuff.
417280	422440	Then we went out on a bus that, that, that said like show's coming to town and, and,
422440	425680	and went to Portland and went, hello, Portland, we're doing a show.
425680	429640	I don't know why we're Southern when we do the show, but it's, it's cause we're like
429640	430640	this wild west show.
430640	432480	We're out there like, we're doing a show here.
432480	433600	Now we're doing a show there.
433600	434600	Now we're doing a show here.
434600	439080	And the whole time we were doing shows everywhere, we kept saying both in our hearts and our
439080	444080	brains and out loud with our mouths, we kept saying, uh, uh, at some point we're going
444080	445700	to go back home.
445700	450440	Now when we say home, we don't mean me and my underwear watching, uh, uh, uh, you know,
450440	451440	Die Hard 2.
451440	454540	Like, like we mean like this.
454540	457680	So if this is home, then this isn't a show anymore.
457680	462560	And so the transformative thing probably for the audience is, uh, uh, lack of benefit.
463560	465360	Is that I don't give a shit anymore.
465360	468600	Like, like, like, like Pat, Patton Oswalt was right.
468600	469760	Like I can't, can't came back.
469760	473400	Like I was in the green room and I was like, so what do we, what the thought of it as a
473400	475440	show did not enter my head.
475440	479000	It's such a tee up for some critic from the audience to yell out, like, start thinking
479000	481000	of it as a show now, please.
481000	484320	But that $10, my friend, still green.
484320	487760	It's better when you just, uh, like my favorite show was salt lake city where there was 62
487760	491400	people and we brought a Mormon chick up on stage and we talked about it and it was like,
491400	492400	it felt like this.
492400	497680	The closest we had to, uh, to meltdown was this small little comedy club with iron girders
497680	500720	here and there and it was a small little room, but you didn't need another person in there
500720	503520	and it really was like the most communicative and together.
503520	510400	And I like the show, um, here because it's become this little revival tent and we start
510400	514520	meeting people and like when we connect with that night's audience and it's cool to go
514520	518640	to salt lake city where there's, you know, you don't have any expectations like fucking
518640	523920	we're going to hit salt lake baby, the city of lights and that was my favorite one because
523920	525240	that was the most like this.
525240	528840	I think when you're, you're, you're not Wayne Brady.
528840	534360	You're not going to get up there and sing a big song and do a tab dance and Dan, it's
534360	538920	time you fucking fucking own the fact that you're never going to be Wayne Brady, man.
538920	543360	For those of you listening, my expression is deeply and sincerely hurt.
543360	555080	All right, well let's find out if you are Wayne Brady, you know, should I do an impression
555080	557080	of the clumps?
557080	568760	Hey, I'm Wayne Brady, Wayne Brady, hanging out, good to hang out with Wayne Brady.
569760	571760	Now you're Wayne Brady.
571760	572760	You're going to be Wayne Brady.
572760	573760	I am Wayne Brady.
573760	574760	Okay.
574760	576760	Then why are you hanging out with him?
576760	587640	Because I love myself, I'm Wayne Brady, gonna eat some gravy, put it on my potatoes, I don't
587640	598880	hate hoes, I love them and I love singing in different styles with accents.
598880	606600	I'm not really familiar with his work.
606600	607600	It was worth a try.
607600	611560	I saw him in the Chappelle thing, it was awesome.
611560	613160	We'll edit all this out.
613160	614160	That's my new mantra.
614160	615160	No, that stays.
615160	616160	That fucking stays.
617160	621160	Anyways, let's get to the goods, man.
621160	622800	Let's get to the confessional goods.
622800	624400	Dig some shit out of me, Jeff.
624400	625400	That's the thing that I...
625400	626400	All right, here's the thing.
626400	627400	Going to town.
627400	628400	Hi, Portland.
628400	629400	Hey, Portland.
629400	632600	I looked on Wikipedia.
632600	639560	Your town has a tall building and a weather phenomenon called the Borealis Vigoris.
639560	643160	Your sports team is the Cougars.
643160	644720	Small talk, small talk, Jeff.
644720	645720	Small talk.
645720	647720	I couldn't wait to get back here and get deep.
647720	650160	Talk to me about my butt and my dick and stuff.
650160	652680	But why couldn't you get deep with those people?
652680	653680	I could.
653680	654680	No, that was my mistake.
654680	655680	That's not Portland's mistake.
655680	657280	I'm just saying, going out there, that's what happened to me.
657280	659120	I was like, oh, hi, Portland.
659120	661120	Thanks for having me in your town, Portland.
661120	662760	Oh, I love you, Portland.
662760	664880	Oh, hi, Austin.
664880	669120	Would you like a mint, Austin?
669120	672480	Trivia fact, the cowboy hat was invented here.
673240	676120	And then, oh, I fucked your mom in a cowboy hat.
676120	677960	Oh, what do you think about that?
677960	679840	Jeff, it's not real.
679840	681200	I want to get real.
681200	684240	I couldn't wait to get back here and get real.
684240	690720	These are my 50 Shades of Grey sadomasochistic partners.
690720	692680	These are the safety pin nipples.
692680	695480	These are the hot wax people.
695480	696840	Here's my concern.
696840	700520	This behavior that you're showing right now was my concern towards the end.
700520	703800	That Harman Town was a very dangerous thing for you.
703800	706480	Because you do this show, and you go, I would talk about my hemorrhoid, and I would talk
706480	711440	about fucking your mama, and I'd fucking like, I dare you to not like me.
711440	715960	And then after the show, everybody comes up and likes you and wants you to sign a thing
715960	718760	and sign your image, or sign your book, or do this.
718760	726380	And you find out, possibly a very dangerous thing for you, the idea that you can't do
726380	727380	something wrong.
727380	728380	Right?
729220	735500	And then on the tour bus, you started to kind of hulk out a couple times, because it's called
735500	736500	Harman Town.
736500	738380	You called it Harman Country.
738380	742260	And there's images of you everywhere, and there's all these shirts, and there's pins,
742260	749260	and there's books, and there's just this giant narcissist jacuzzi that you just settle into.
749260	751820	You just sit there like a...
751820	754860	Definitely, definitely had the upper hand in fights with my girlfriend.
754860	756260	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
756260	758100	Harman Town.
758100	764420	Keep the sign, population me.
764420	765420	It's me.
765420	767860	Well, my one prediction was right.
767860	770620	You fuckers fought a lot on that trip.
770620	774020	I mean, and then again, you might have, maybe that's as much as you fight when I'm not with
774020	775020	you all the time.
775020	779060	I've never been with you almost all the time, kind of day and night.
779060	782820	We were around each other quite a bit, but you guys, wow.
782820	785180	We like to go at it.
785180	786180	Sometimes on stage.
786180	787180	Sometimes...
787260	791260	Tim Pesto is firing Irish muses.
791260	792260	And now she...
792260	797700	The thing that blew my mind, we were in Pittsburgh, I don't know if anybody heard that one.
797700	800780	The ladies, the ladies love Pittsburgh.
800780	805420	The guys are like, he was right in the middle of a fart joke.
805420	806420	I'm surprised.
806420	811740	I thought Pittsburgh set the woman's rights movement back about 75 years, because she
811740	814740	came out and she had been crying about a bit that you had been doing about fucking a young
814740	816820	girl, and it was totally a bit.
816820	821980	And then she announced that you called her the C word, and then the show came to just
821980	824860	a screech, just to a total stop.
824860	828540	And then at the end of that, she said, so can I move in with you?
828540	831580	And she was like, wow.
831580	832580	I thought that was...
832580	837540	Yeah, that made me not ask her to move in with me for like two extra weeks.
837540	841860	But then you end the tour by asking her to move in with you.
841860	843860	Yeah, that's two weeks.
844660	849340	I was going to ask her any minute, and then she fucking said it.
849340	850980	I can't say yes when someone...
850980	852340	We were thinking the same thing at the same time.
852340	853340	We're in love with each other.
853340	856100	Deal with it.
856100	859100	We're soulmates.
859100	860100	And Jeff, you're great.
860100	861100	You're very cool.
861100	867180	You're in your suit, and you have this armor against the world.
867180	868180	You're the emotionless...
868180	871580	The master of deep pain, Dan, the master of healing.
871580	873140	Even keel guy.
873140	878820	He likes his vernet bronca, and he likes to watch the History Channel, and every city
878820	883380	we went to, he went to a bookstore and bought an obscure book, and then went to a bar and
883380	884380	read it.
884380	885380	Like...
885380	886380	I just...
886380	887380	I don't...
887380	890380	He sounds awesome.
890380	891380	You're not allowed...
891380	893380	You're not allowed to hate it.
893380	898140	Does he have a sister?
898140	899140	You know, and you're fine.
899140	900820	You're the master of your domain.
900820	905220	Oh, speaking of which, I haven't jerked off in like three days.
905220	906220	For three days?
906220	907220	Like, like, like, like...
907220	908220	It might be four now.
908220	909500	Yeah, I made this decision.
909500	912580	I went on Duncan Trussell's podcast, and we talked about jerking off, and...
912580	916660	Wait, how did you connect that from talking about how awesome I am to...
916660	917660	Master of...
917660	918660	Master of...
918660	919660	Well, I...
919660	920660	Are you the word master, or do you thought about your dick?
920660	922380	No, no, no, no.
922380	923380	He reads too many books.
923380	925500	He doesn't watch Seinfeld.
925500	930020	Master of my domain is a Seinfeld line, in reference to the episode where they all tried
930020	931980	to not jerk off.
931980	940620	But yeah, I'm four days into what they call on Reddit, no fap.
940620	941620	The word fap is a bummer.
941620	942620	It is a bummer.
942620	943620	It's a huge bummer.
943620	944620	Don't say fap.
944620	945620	It's so...
945620	949540	Do not fucking say fap under any circumstances.
949540	950540	Don't type it.
950540	951540	Don't read it.
951540	952540	Don't fucking...
952540	953540	It is the worst.
953540	955940	Like, I was introduced to that word when we first started doing Community, and there
955940	960460	was an interview with Alison Brie in The Onion or something, and then there was a comment
960460	964940	section, and there was a comment that said, like, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.
964940	966940	And I was like, what is that?
966940	967940	Oh.
967940	968940	Boo.
968940	969940	It made me...
969940	970940	It just made me...
970940	971940	Don't...
971940	979380	Imagine your Hawaiian shirt, and your surgical gloves, and you're just, I can...
979380	982460	What did you just reveal about yourself then?
982460	985980	That I've seen the movie, what was it called, Hardwired or whatever.
985980	986980	Wow.
986980	987980	This is a 90s movie.
987980	991820	Yeah, don't conjure up imagery from me.
991820	993060	Don't make me part of your world.
993060	995180	No onomatopoeia in sexuality.
995180	997700	Don't ask black people time travel questions.
997700	999420	No onomatopoeia in sex.
999420	1000420	That's it.
1000420	1001420	That's it.
1001420	1003740	We found our Constitution.
1003740	1008460	We did it.
1008460	1010580	It took us a whole tour to figure that out.
1010580	1011580	Go deep, Jeff.
1011580	1012580	Come on.
1012580	1015420	I want to reveal something.
1015420	1016420	That's what the show is.
1016420	1017420	Come on.
1017420	1018420	Hit me in the quick.
1018420	1021940	I want to talk about something real.
1021940	1022940	Okay.
1022940	1027740	Do you watch the Grammys?
1027740	1036860	Dan, don't cry, don't cry.
1036860	1037860	I didn't.
1037860	1039580	Yeah, fuck the Grammys, too.
1039580	1040580	Fuck it, fuck it, though.
1041580	1042580	Whatever.
1042580	1043580	Well, I mean, I don't know, man.
1043580	1049780	I really feel like, I don't know, I wanted to Barbara Walters you tonight, but we have
1049780	1050780	guests we want to bring up.
1050780	1053220	But then I thought, like, I'm not going, I'm not going, because I don't even know what
1053220	1054220	the angle would be.
1054220	1059020	I really feel that there was an opportunity, not that you're going to go out there and
1059020	1062380	you, not that you're Walt Whitman and you're going to go find out where you lived and what
1062380	1066820	you lived for and shit, but you would come back with, just go like, oh, that's why.
1066820	1068540	This is what's important to me.
1068540	1070020	This is what Harmontown is.
1070020	1073380	This is what, I mean, we learn little details and stuff like that.
1073380	1078300	But I feel like there really is a reason you did it.
1078300	1082700	There was some reason you stood after every show and met those people.
1082700	1085180	There was something driving you to do that in the first place.
1085180	1087460	That was more than, oh, it's a birthday present to myself.
1087460	1092900	I think there really is a subconscious desire and drive there that I don't know that you
1092900	1093900	even know what it is.
1093900	1094900	No, I don't, Jeff.
1094900	1095900	I don't.
1095900	1096900	Are you being serious?
1096900	1097900	No, I don't.
1098220	1099220	Connecting with people.
1099220	1101660	And I think I was looking forward to getting back here because this is the place where
1101660	1105740	people, like we would go to certain places where you couldn't hear the people, but they
1105740	1109780	had listened to the podcast so they know that if Maddie here in the front row, whose name
1109780	1112860	I know, because you can see everybody in the audience and you can hear everybody in the
1112860	1118780	audience, if she pipes up about, if she goes like, that reminds me of pants, then I go,
1118780	1119780	I'm sorry.
1119780	1121220	What the fuck are you talking about, Maddie?
1121220	1122220	Why did you say that?
1122220	1123220	It reminds you of pants.
1123220	1127100	And then she'll say like, well, because I love pants and you just said Christmas and
1127100	1128100	Christmas is good.
1128100	1129100	Pants are good.
1129100	1130100	Well, okay.
1130100	1131100	Very good.
1131100	1135460	Do you want to come up here and talk about your fucking Christmas pants, Maddie?
1135460	1137980	I wonder if anybody out here, I mean, this is a tough question.
1137980	1142660	I don't want Adam Goldberg to storm the stage when I ask this.
1142660	1147380	I wonder if anybody, because there, how many of you, and I'm not like just like asking
1147380	1150340	for like a round of applause, but like how many of you listen to all of them, like all
1150340	1151340	the podcasts?
1151340	1152340	Don't raise your hands.
1152340	1153340	You have to clap.
1153340	1154340	All right.
1154580	1155580	All right.
1155580	1159860	So I wonder like maybe maybe one of these people would have a better like overall perspective
1159860	1163580	on what that actually was, if it was anything at all, if it succeeded in anything.
1163580	1166420	You're really begging for Adam Goldberg to storm the stage.
1166420	1169180	I certainly am not certain.
1169180	1171100	Maddie, did you listen to all those shows?
1171100	1172100	Yeah.
1172100	1173100	All right.
1173100	1174100	Would you like to come up and give us a little report?
1174100	1175100	Hello, Maddie.
1175100	1178900	Come on up on stage.
1178900	1179900	Your motherless tonight.
1179900	1180900	Your mother's not here.
1180900	1183900	She's all grown up.
1183900	1195060	Maddie, Maddie is a young child that used to come to the show with her mother that is
1195060	1196460	now you're in college.
1196460	1197460	I am.
1197460	1198460	Everything's cool.
1198460	1199460	All right.
1199460	1200460	I feel less guilty now.
1200460	1201460	I thought you'd feel that way.
1201460	1202900	Saying the things they say in front of you.
1202900	1203900	What are you studying in college?
1203900	1205900	I'm looking into media studies.
1205900	1206900	Who?
1206900	1207900	Media studies?
1207900	1208900	Yeah.
1208900	1209900	What's cool?
1209900	1210900	Occidental.
1210900	1211900	Oh, great.
1211900	1212900	Yeah.
1213900	1214900	Apologies.
1214900	1215900	All right.
1215900	1217900	So what's your take on the tour?
1217900	1218900	Anything.
1218900	1219900	Say it.
1219900	1221900	I can handle anything now.
1221900	1222900	I'm a master.
1222900	1225900	You declared yourself God at the last show.
1225900	1227900	And in this one.
1227900	1228900	And every day forth.
1228900	1231900	I am God.
1231900	1232900	I think...
1232900	1234900	Maddie, sorry to interrupt.
1234900	1238900	I really think that you're in a dangerous psychological place right now.
1238900	1241900	Or whatever the opposite of dangerous is.
1242900	1243900	Safe?
1246900	1247900	Doesn't feel safe.
1247900	1249900	So I guess it's probably dangerous.
1249900	1253900	I think you're closer to being Hans Gruber than John McClain now.
1253900	1254900	Yeah.
1254900	1257900	You know who else was in a dangerous psychological place?
1257900	1258900	Don't say Jesus.
1258900	1259900	God.
1262900	1265900	Because he was nothing at the beginning of everything.
1265900	1269900	And it bummed him out so much he had to explode into some things.
1270900	1272900	Are you saying you're going to explode?
1273900	1275900	He hasn't jerked off for three days.
1276900	1277900	He's coming for you.
1277900	1279900	Are you going to create a universe of jizz in this place?
1279900	1280900	Jesus.
1280900	1281900	She's...
1281900	1282900	Sorry, Maddie.
1282900	1284900	She's out of knowledge now, but she's still a kid.
1284900	1285900	Okay.
1285900	1286900	All right, Maddie.
1286900	1287900	What's your take?
1287900	1292900	Well, I think you definitely exceeded in becoming God in your own mind.
1292900	1298900	I think the more you met people and the more people were in the audience,
1298900	1301900	you took on that God role and...
1301900	1302900	What's that guy doing?
1302900	1303900	What's that guy doing?
1303900	1304900	Yeah.
1304900	1305900	What are you doing?
1305900	1306900	What are you doing, dude?
1306900	1307900	He's typing on his phone.
1307900	1308900	Are you tweeting his quotes?
1308900	1309900	Well, no.
1309900	1310900	What's he...
1310900	1311900	Oh, okay.
1311900	1312900	I'm sorry.
1312900	1313900	I'm sorry.
1313900	1314900	I didn't mean to...
1314900	1315900	I didn't mean to terrify you.
1315900	1316900	Yes, you did.
1316900	1317900	You did mean to.
1317900	1320900	Do you have a hand like mine?
1321900	1322900	No, you do.
1322900	1323900	You actually does.
1323900	1324900	Okay.
1324900	1325900	I'm not God yet.
1326900	1329900	But then when you found out that he was putting up a vine image,
1329900	1330900	a gif of you doing something, you're like,
1330900	1331900	Oh, that's cool.
1331900	1332900	Keep it going.
1332900	1333900	Okay, fine.
1333900	1334900	Yeah.
1334900	1335900	As long as it's not of Duncan Trussell.
1335900	1336900	All right.
1336900	1337900	Okay.
1337900	1338900	Continue, Maddie.
1338900	1339900	Sorry.
1339900	1340900	I just...
1340900	1341900	There was somebody that was not, you know...
1341900	1342900	Not bowing.
1342900	1343900	Not scraping.
1343900	1345900	Not worshiping at the altar.
1345900	1349900	Yeah, he was tweeting and fleeting and scooping.
1349900	1351900	Dangerous, dangerous territory.
1352900	1356900	Did you learn anything about Dan or about Hymantown throughout that journey?
1357900	1359900	Or was it just kind of a linear waste of time?
1359900	1363900	I feel like he's revealed so much of himself in past podcasts,
1363900	1368900	past tweets, past life, that he just like...
1368900	1370900	Anything he said on tour didn't really surprise me.
1370900	1375900	Like he could have been talking about butts and cocks and dicks and whatever.
1375900	1376900	Better scary?
1376900	1378900	When you take me out in the survey?
1378900	1379900	Sorry.
1382900	1386900	You could have ranted a race for half an hour and wanted every person in the audience to kill themselves
1386900	1388900	because they felt bad, but I wasn't surprised that...
1388900	1390900	I wouldn't have been surprised that happened.
1390900	1391900	What was your...
1391900	1392900	Not in a bad...
1392900	1399900	Was there a real highlight or really low light in any of the shows that kind of surprised you?
1399900	1402900	Well, you're talking to the person who has an 80-year-old's memory here.
1402900	1406900	I'm digging right now to remember things and it's not going well.
1406900	1407900	Why do you have an 80-year-old's memory?
1407900	1408900	That's a great question.
1408900	1410900	I don't remember the things I do two days ago.
1410900	1412900	And I should probably get checked out.
1412900	1413900	Oh.
1413900	1415900	All right, talk about cookies then.
1415900	1418900	I was jealous of young people because I thought you remembered everything.
1418900	1419900	No, you...
1419900	1421900	Okay, I get surprised when you remember my name every time.
1421900	1425900	Like I don't remember things, people I meet.
1425900	1426900	So thank you.
1426900	1428900	Well, you're kind of a pain in the ass.
1428900	1429900	It's a mnemonic device.
1429900	1432900	It's like, oh, boy, there's Maddie.
1432900	1433900	I don't show up every time.
1433900	1434900	No, no.
1434900	1435900	I'm not out.
1435900	1437900	I don't come every time.
1437900	1438900	Thank you, Maddie.
1438900	1439900	Thank you, Maddie.
1439900	1440900	We're almost there.
1440900	1441900	We're getting there.
1441900	1442900	We're digging.
1442900	1443900	We're...
1443900	1444900	It doesn't...
1444900	1447900	You know, Jeff, the show's not about the show.
1447900	1448900	There's no show.
1448900	1449900	The show...
1449900	1450900	There's no...
1450900	1451900	The show's about you.
1451900	1453900	Let's get to the show.
1453900	1458900	Maybe it's foolish of me to even think that there was supposed to be a purpose for it.
1458900	1459900	That you should learn anything.
1459900	1460900	It's like the story structure freaking you.
1460900	1461900	We kept drawing these things.
1461900	1464900	Like, we're at the refusal of a call now.
1464900	1466900	Now we're at the meeting with the goddess.
1466900	1467900	We kept doing that.
1467900	1469900	But then we return home.
1469900	1471900	Do you feel that you've created...
1471900	1474900	That you've actually described a full circle story-wise?
1474900	1475900	No.
1475900	1478900	Because I feel like that Harmentown and the tour is...
1478900	1483900	If there's a story structure element to that, that this will be the first quarter or the
1483900	1485900	first half of a larger story.
1485900	1486900	Oh, well, okay.
1486900	1489900	And right now, coming home, this is the meeting with the goddess, where you're back home
1489900	1492900	into your safety net, and now the terrible shit happens.
1492900	1494900	Or something really awesome happens.
1494900	1496900	We get to reboot the show now.
1496900	1498900	We get to decide what it's going to be about, you know?
1498900	1499900	What do you want...
1499900	1500900	Because we can't...
1500900	1501900	One thing's for certain.
1501900	1504900	I think we want to connect with these people, Jeff.
1504900	1507900	I want my brain to merge with their brains.
1507900	1509900	I want to feel what they feel.
1509900	1510900	For real?
1510900	1511900	Yeah.
1511900	1512900	Okay.
1512900	1514900	Let's do it.
1514900	1518900	I feel like there's someone in the audience tonight that's recently written a book that
1518900	1523900	will be released that needs to be plugged.
1523900	1526900	He was an amazing entertainer.
1526900	1533900	He's part of Donald Glover's little YouTube troupe, Derek Comedy.
1533900	1534900	He's an old friend.
1534900	1537900	He looks like Jesus more and more every day.
1537900	1540900	Please, I feel his pain.
1540900	1541900	I feel his brain.
1541900	1544900	Welcome, D.C. Pearson.
1553900	1554900	Thanks, Dan.
1554900	1555900	How's it going?
1555900	1556900	It's going good.
1556900	1557900	I mean, I don't know.
1557900	1558900	You tell me.
1558900	1560900	It feels like kind of...
1560900	1565900	I was saying backstage, like, oh, I feel really good because I feel like we were out on the
1565900	1566900	road and now I'm not worried at all.
1566900	1568900	Like, Patton Oswalt's prediction was true.
1568900	1569900	I'm not worried about doing the show here anymore.
1569900	1570900	Right.
1570900	1572900	And I think that could be a bad thing I was saying in the green room.
1572900	1576900	Right now, I'm flirting with the idea that it's a bad thing.
1576900	1578900	That you didn't learn anything?
1578900	1579900	No.
1579900	1582900	That have become boring because I'm not driven by the anxiety of being a good or a bad show.
1582900	1583900	Being comfortable.
1583900	1585900	So now I'm sitting here.
1585900	1589900	Yeah, you're the reason we don't see the character after the movie's over.
1589900	1590900	Exactly.
1590900	1591900	You're the reason the movie's over.
1591900	1592900	Right.
1592900	1593900	You know what I mean?
1593900	1595900	Like, it's not like we just stick around after the credits and then he's still just like,
1595900	1596900	yep, still happy.
1596900	1597900	Yeah.
1597900	1598900	You know.
1598900	1599900	The movie's over.
1599900	1600900	Unless he joins the Avengers.
1600900	1601900	Yeah.
1601900	1602900	After the credits.
1602900	1603900	Maybe you join the Avengers, Dan.
1603900	1604900	Is that tonight for you?
1604900	1605900	Yeah.
1605900	1606900	I guess.
1606900	1611900	Is there an Avengers for, like, just people with houses that like to take bubble baths?
1611900	1615900	If there is, we can go and buy it at this comic book store.
1615900	1617900	They will have it if there is one.
1617900	1618900	Avengers.
1618900	1619900	Comes to watch one, right?
1619900	1620900	Yeah.
1620900	1621900	So you wrote a book.
1621900	1622900	I did.
1622900	1624900	It's called Crap Kingdom.
1624900	1627900	I like our Beastie Boys.
1627900	1629900	It's called Crap Kingdom.
1629900	1630900	Yeah.
1630900	1631900	And it's not out yet.
1631900	1632900	It's not quite out yet.
1632900	1636900	It's gonna be out on March 7th, but the reason I'm promoting it before it's actually out,
1636900	1638900	is I'm trying to get people to pre-order it.
1638900	1641900	So badly, do I want them to pre-order it, that if you pre-order it, which you can do
1641900	1645900	on Amazon, you can do it at Pals Books, all these different places that sell books online,
1645900	1650900	and you send me the receipt at crapkingdom at gmail.com, I will write your name into
1650900	1653900	a custom rap song and or a crap song.
1653900	1654900	Interesting.
1654900	1655900	Get us some overlap there.
1655900	1656900	You do.
1656900	1661900	And you gave me an advance copy, and it has so many, it's filled with pages.
1661900	1665900	Dan, what was your favorite part of the book?
1665900	1669900	I just, the binding.
1669900	1674900	I love the concept of there's separate pages, but all of them are together.
1674900	1675900	I insisted on that.
1675900	1679900	I was like, I know that most books are just bricks with scrawl on them.
1679900	1680900	It's so meta.
1680900	1681900	But I want individualized pages.
1681900	1685900	Because I feel like that's where the medium's going.
1685900	1691900	The elevator pitch is that it's a guy who's beckoned to be the savior of a fantasy world.
1691900	1693900	It's kind of a young adult novel.
1693900	1694900	Yeah.
1694900	1697900	It's Jeff.
1697900	1702900	It's about a guy who gets beckoned to a fantasy world to be its savior.
1702900	1704900	Sounds fascinating, Mr. Harmon.
1704900	1709900	The world's kind of crappy, and he doesn't take him up on it.
1709900	1710900	He doesn't want to be part of the fantasy world.
1710900	1711900	So you've written a novel.
1711900	1712900	It's a novel.
1712900	1713900	Yes.
1713900	1714900	That's awesome.
1714900	1715900	Thank you.
1715900	1716900	I'm very impressed by that.
1716900	1717900	That's very cool.
1717900	1718900	I think more people should do that.
1718900	1719900	I think everyone should do it.
1719900	1720900	No, I don't think everybody should.
1720900	1721900	Okay.
1721900	1722900	I think novelists should write novels.
1722900	1723900	Okay.
1723900	1727900	So if you haven't already written a novel, you're not a novelist, so don't write a novel.
1727900	1728900	I've written a novel.
1728900	1731900	But if you have already written a novel, continue doing so.
1731900	1734900	I mean, people that have the gift for writing prose and for writing...
1734900	1735900	Oh, I see.
1735900	1739900	You don't think there should be a weird Freaky Friday thing where I become a sushi chef and
1739900	1740900	then he becomes a novelist?
1740900	1741900	I think so.
1741900	1742900	Actually, he'd probably be...
1742900	1743900	Now I want to...
1743900	1744900	Shijiro read a novel.
1744900	1745900	That's my new novel.
1745900	1749900	My new novel is called Sushi Writer.
1750900	1752900	Is it true that they're called novels?
1752900	1755900	Because at one point there was a weird new thing to do to write one of these things.
1755900	1756900	These are novels.
1756900	1757900	Holy shit.
1757900	1758900	Yeah, look at this thing.
1758900	1759900	Books used to be epistolary.
1759900	1760900	There were letters.
1760900	1761900	Yeah, there were letters back and forth.
1761900	1762900	There were histories.
1762900	1764900	But the idea of telling a story about a thing that happened to a person, that was a very
1764900	1765900	novel.
1765900	1767900	Do you think the first novel was just a lie?
1767900	1768900	You know what I mean?
1768900	1769900	It was a book that was ostensibly...
1769900	1771900	Was it just that...
1771900	1772900	Not Fifty Shades of Grey.
1772900	1773900	What's it called?
1773900	1776900	The guy that was on Oprah, Stephen Frey or whatever?
1776900	1777900	What's that?
1777900	1778900	James Frey.
1778900	1781900	If he had been in Medieval Times, would he have been the first novelist?
1781900	1786900	And he was like, it's just a lie, but we can say I'm amazing if you want to.
1788900	1790900	They do talk a lot, don't they, Dan?
1790900	1791900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1791900	1793900	No, it's a town meeting, really, honestly.
1793900	1795900	If you go out to any of these fuckers, it's like a whole show.
1795900	1796900	What's your name?
1796900	1797900	Sean.
1797900	1798900	Jesus Christ.
1798900	1799900	Wow.
1799900	1800900	For those of you...
1800900	1803900	You handed him a mic.
1803900	1806900	Hand it to him or put it in his face?
1806900	1807900	Like a journalist.
1807900	1808900	What's your name, sir?
1808900	1809900	My name is Sean.
1809900	1813900	I was just saying that early Defoe novels, they always have...
1813900	1819900	It's reported that the person, you know, Rums and Crusoe sent in his journals and he's,
1819900	1822900	I'm Defoe, just giving them to you.
1822900	1823900	Early willing Defoe novels?
1823900	1824900	Right.
1824900	1827900	So he was passing it off as actual history, yeah.
1827900	1828900	Isn't that interesting, Jeff?
1828900	1829900	And what's your name?
1829900	1830900	Scott.
1830900	1831900	See?
1834900	1836900	All just people.
1836900	1837900	When were you born?
1837900	1838900	What year?
1838900	1839900	1989.
1840900	1841900	That's crazy.
1841900	1845900	Dan, what were you doing in 1989?
1845900	1849900	I was going like, oh, I'm afraid to tell my friends I'm not into this Batman movie as
1849900	1852900	much as they are.
1852900	1854900	I wouldn't get that tattoo if I were you.
1854900	1858900	They'll probably change the logo.
1858900	1861900	If I'm them, I'm going to change that logo.
1861900	1862900	It looks like...
1863900	1867900	My mom looked at that Batman logo from the Tim Burton movie and she said, is that teeth?
1867900	1868900	It looks like yellow.
1868900	1870900	If you look at the yellow parts, it looks like teeth.
1870900	1871900	Yeah, yeah.
1871900	1873900	Like a little teeth monster is going to get you.
1873900	1878900	I like that that guy said 1989, but when he said 19, it sounded like it was going to
1878900	1879900	be a much older year.
1879900	1880900	You know what I mean?
1880900	1881900	He's like, 19?
1881900	1883900	Like it sounded like it was going to be not as recent.
1883900	1885900	To him, 89 is an older year.
1885900	1886900	It was like...
1886900	1889900	Back then, air was new.
1889900	1892900	To him, 89 was like the Stone Age.
1892900	1893900	He's an asshole.
1893900	1894900	Yeah, get with it, old man.
1894900	1895900	Yeah.
1898900	1899900	Yeah.
1899900	1900900	Everybody else all at the same time.
1900900	1901900	What's your name?
1901900	1903900	Zach.
1903900	1904900	It's crazy.
1904900	1905900	It's Zach.
1905900	1906900	It's insane.
1906900	1907900	How could everyone be named Zach?
1907900	1908900	It's amazing.
1910900	1912900	With one voice saying, Zach.
1912900	1918900	Sorry, we're electrocuting prisoners down the hall.
1918900	1919900	Every once in a while.
1919900	1921900	Do you have Harmontown death row?
1921900	1922900	Yeah.
1922900	1925900	You forgot to make the call because you were doing the show, so they didn't get to pardon
1925900	1926900	another death?
1926900	1927900	Yeah.
1929900	1931900	I'm just waiting for that call from Mr. Harmon.
1931900	1933900	I know what's going to come through.
1933900	1934900	He read...
1934900	1936900	I learned law in prison.
1936900	1937900	I put this packet together.
1937900	1938900	I sent it to him.
1938900	1940900	It's an airtight defense of why I wasn't there.
1940900	1941900	He'll read it.
1941900	1942900	Certainly.
1942900	1943900	I'm sorry, O'Malley.
1943900	1945900	Your pardon hasn't come through.
1945900	1946900	Yeah.
1946900	1949900	From my voice, you can tell my last name is O'Malley.
1950900	1953900	I was trying to soften up the racism a bit.
1959900	1961900	I was trying to sand off the edges.
1964900	1967900	I'm part of a demographic often sentenced to death.
1967900	1969900	But bless my lucky charms.
1977900	1979900	We can call each other leprechauns.
1992900	1995900	I was friends with a kid named Sean Malarkey in grade school.
1995900	1996900	His last name was Malarkey.
1996900	1997900	Malarkey?
1997900	1998900	It was crazy.
1998900	1999900	Hilarious.
1999900	2003900	I know I've said it before on Harmontown, but my teacher had a friend named Pat Mowini.
2004900	2006900	I told you about Jeremy Dick.
2006900	2007900	What?
2007900	2008900	Jeremy Dick.
2008900	2009900	I told the story about Jeremy Dick.
2009900	2010900	Jeremy Dick?
2010900	2011900	No.
2011900	2012900	Don't dissect it.
2012900	2013900	His name was Jeremy Dick.
2013900	2014900	That's no big deal.
2014900	2015900	Jeremy Dick.
2015900	2018900	But rumor had it, his dad's name was Harry and his mom's name was Ima.
2018900	2019900	Probably not.
2019900	2020900	Probably not, right?
2020900	2022900	So then I ran into him.
2022900	2023900	I was in grade school with him.
2023900	2025900	I told this story, right, on the podcast?
2025900	2026900	It might be pre-podcast.
2026900	2027900	Or maybe...
2027900	2028900	Oh, it is.
2028900	2029900	Alright, fuck you guys.
2030900	2031900	Well, how's it end?
2032900	2033900	I ran into him in the kitchen.
2033900	2035900	I was smoking a joint with him.
2035900	2039900	This kid that I knew in grade school, this rumor, is Jeremy Dick.
2039900	2042900	You know his dad's name is Harry and his mom's name is Ima.
2042900	2046900	And I was like, that's not astronomically possible.
2046900	2048900	That doesn't happen.
2048900	2053900	You're not Harry Dick and you meet a woman and she says her name's Ima and you're like,
2053900	2054900	let's get married.
2054900	2055900	This doesn't happen.
2057900	2059900	Have you read my script?
2061900	2064900	And then I ran into him and I'm standing in a kitchen.
2064900	2067900	I'm probably like, I don't know, 18, 19 years old.
2067900	2071900	Let's say 21 because I have a joint in my hand so that I don't want to get...
2071900	2073900	I don't know if he can get sued or whatever.
2076900	2078900	And there's Jeremy Dick.
2078900	2082900	He's a grown man now and he's passing a joint.
2082900	2086900	And I go, hey man, I always wanted to ask you, was your dad's name really Harry?
2086900	2088900	And he said, yeah, yeah.
2088900	2090900	And I said, now, okay.
2090900	2093900	But your mom's name wasn't Ima, was it?
2093900	2096900	And he said, my mom's dead, man.
2097900	2099900	So therefore she didn't have a name.
2100900	2105900	Also, did he ask you, hey man, is it legal to smoke weed when you're 21?
2107900	2109900	Because you've been spreading that around.
2109900	2111900	Yeah, I don't know.
2112900	2115900	I don't know what eggshells I'm trying to walk on.
2115900	2117900	It's not legality.
2117900	2119900	What are you, 19, Maddie?
2119900	2120900	What are you, 18?
2120900	2121900	Oh, Jesus.
2121900	2126900	See, like, just don't do as I say, don't do as I do.
2126900	2128900	That I say that I do.
2129900	2131900	You say do drugs, though.
2131900	2135900	I say I did a lot of them and then I have a huge house.
2137900	2142900	If you connect those dots, that's your mistake that you've made.
2142900	2145900	But imagine how big his house could be if he didn't do that.
2145900	2146900	Exactly.
2148900	2152900	I just can't get over the fact that we have Jesus and God on the same stage.
2155900	2156900	That's a line up.
2156900	2157900	You've done great.
2157900	2158900	I'm so sorry.
2158900	2162900	I completely ignored you while everyone murdered you.
2162900	2163900	Yeah, it's cool.
2163900	2166900	Man, I wanted to know Breakfast Club better in that moment so I could launch into like
2166900	2169900	the Smoke Up Johnny monologue from Jesus's point of view.
2169900	2175900	See, this is what you get when you're in Gethsemane and you take the cup.
2178900	2179900	Sorry, I set you up for that.
2179900	2182900	He's showing a hole in his palm and stuff.
2183900	2184900	Last Supper Club.
2193900	2194900	This show is great.
2194900	2195900	This show is great.
2195900	2196900	You're fucking killing it, man.
2196900	2197900	I know.
2197900	2199900	And it's because I stopped being about me because I became God.
2199900	2202900	This show has never stopped being about you for a second.
2202900	2204900	I achieved apotheosis.
2204900	2205900	I stopped caring about the show.
2205900	2208900	The mistake we made at the very tippy top of the show is focusing on me because I have
2208900	2210900	nothing left to like.
2210900	2211900	So bring up D.C.
2211900	2212900	Pearson.
2212900	2213900	Oh, nice.
2213900	2214900	Now you're killing it.
2214900	2215900	You're doing your little riffy bits.
2215900	2216900	Yeah.
2217900	2219900	You're dropping bombs from the three-point line over there.
2219900	2220900	I'm fucking nailing it.
2220900	2222900	This is the show, Jeff.
2223900	2224900	Now you fucked it again.
2225900	2229900	Dan, will there be a point where you will lay down the mantle of being Dan Harmon?
2230900	2231900	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2231900	2232900	I know.
2232900	2233900	I'm grooming Spencer.
2233900	2234900	Okay.
2234900	2237900	And I don't mean in the literal sense because...
2237900	2238900	I know.
2238900	2239900	His beard is very impressive.
2239900	2240900	Yeah.
2240900	2243900	That would be a Sisyphean task.
2244900	2245900	Grooming Spencer.
2245900	2247900	That's a whole indie movie that you have to...
2248900	2249900	Yeah, Grooming Spencer.
2249900	2251900	That was at Slamdance this year, right?
2251900	2254900	I think Spencer should have his own podcast where he sits in his red flannel shirt and
2254900	2257900	like talks to friends and talks about what's going on.
2257900	2262900	He's much smarter and much younger and has much more to offer.
2263900	2272900	And also, I ran out of Spencer last night and I don't know if I've seen you since we
2272900	2273900	got back.
2273900	2274900	Maybe once, Spencer?
2274900	2275900	I don't know.
2275900	2276900	But you seem like activated.
2276900	2280900	You seem like he came back like charged up by that tour.
2280900	2283900	He feels a little smiley but not in an artificial way.
2283900	2285900	Like I like seeing him happy.
2285900	2286900	He's kind of like...
2286900	2287900	Yeah, he feels a little more energized.
2287900	2291900	He's not afraid to like slouch down into a sedentary fucking glacial...
2292900	2293900	Spencer's a glacier.
2293900	2294900	He's like a force of nature.
2294900	2299900	If he disagrees with you, then there's a river there where the disagreement happened.
2299900	2302900	Like you can't really argue with it because he doesn't disagree unless there's like logic
2302900	2304900	on his side and then you're fucked.
2306900	2311900	But just like, yeah, there's a little buoyancy that I'll take credit for.
2311900	2313900	I think I changed Spencer as a god.
2313900	2314900	Oh, boy.
2316900	2317900	But wait, so...
2318900	2321900	You're really turning into a villain.
2322900	2323900	And I don't care.
2323900	2325900	You got a shirt on with your picture on it.
2326900	2328900	Like all the great villains do.
2329900	2331900	Lex Luthor's line of blue-thirty shirts.
2331900	2333900	Hannibal Lecter out of there.
2335900	2337900	Visit my cafe press, Clarice.
2340900	2345900	Hannibal Lecter in the first season, Jodie Foster, has like the icon with the actual mask.
2346900	2348900	Even though he hasn't worn it yet in the movie.
2349900	2351900	Why are you wearing that weird shirt, Dr. Lecter?
2352900	2354900	But it says got kryptonite.
2356900	2357900	Hannibal Lecter?
2357900	2359900	Yeah, because he's a big villain fan.
2359900	2360900	Oh, I see.
2361900	2362900	He's a villain's villain.
2362900	2365900	Yeah, he's a fan of Lex Luthor.
2365900	2367900	Did you see Hannibal rising?
2367900	2368900	No.
2368900	2373900	They made a prequel to this goddamn character, this beloved guy that eats people,
2374900	2378900	who's famous for the famous images of him wearing this mask.
2378900	2385900	And in the movie, they walk you down the road of why you could be a good person and sexy
2385900	2387900	and decide to start eating people.
2388900	2393900	And on top of it all, he also wears a weird precursor to the mask in the movie.
2393900	2395900	Doesn't make sense at all.
2396900	2397900	Someone gives him like a...
2397900	2400900	The Japanese call this a kugugububu.
2401900	2404900	It looks like the thing from the airplane hangar.
2404900	2406900	That's only a famous image because it's a famous image.
2406900	2408900	It has nothing to do with his origin.
2408900	2411900	It's not like he was on the plane being like, I want to wear that.
2411900	2413900	And they were like, all right, man.
2413900	2415900	I could get used to this.
2416900	2417900	How do I get one of those?
2417900	2419900	You have to eat a lot of people.
2420900	2423900	It is actually bad to the point worth watching.
2423900	2427900	I like that prequels aren't like how this person actually got to become who they are.
2427900	2428900	Hey, remember this?
2428900	2430900	Remember when this is a cool gif?
2430900	2431900	Now it's in a movie.
2431900	2433900	But even worse, the prequels that are like all...
2433900	2435900	You don't even get remember this.
2435900	2437900	All you get is anticipate this.
2439900	2444900	You make a prequel with Breakfast Club and it's just like you're just watching people.
2445900	2446900	Should I pierce my ear?
2446900	2447900	I think I will.
2447900	2450900	And you're supposed to go, fuck yeah.
2450900	2451900	Fuck you.
2451900	2452900	Get with the Breakfast Club.
2452900	2454900	Should I get dandruff?
2454900	2455900	Yeah.
2455900	2456900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2456900	2458900	You're using the wrong shampoo, young lady.
2458900	2459900	What am I watching?
2459900	2464900	I feel like if you were to watch any great movie, if you were to watch its prequel before
2464900	2468900	you had seen the actual great movie that allowed there to be a prequel in the first place,
2468900	2471900	everything in that prequel, I don't know of a prequel that doesn't do this, just completely
2471900	2475900	licks the donut of what ends up being good about these things.
2475900	2478900	Prometheus is just a giant feature length donut lick of alien.
2478900	2479900	Fuck you, Prometheus.
2479900	2480900	It's just dudes.
2480900	2482900	I don't care if you haven't seen it.
2482900	2483900	Somebody said, fuck you.
2483900	2484900	That's Damon Lidloff.
2484900	2485900	Like, yeah, like what?
2485900	2488900	Yeah, I mean, seriously, yeah, that is the weird thing.
2488900	2491900	Like, I really, he's adorable.
2491900	2493900	He's a Channel 101 fan.
2493900	2494900	Right.
2494900	2495900	But come on, I'm an alien fan.
2495900	2500900	Like, you can't, fuck, no amount of press releases is gonna, you can't give me instructions
2500900	2501900	to go into a movie.
2501900	2502900	Don't watch this wrong.
2502900	2505900	You called it an alien prequel, you fuckers.
2505900	2510900	Well, yeah, and the fact that they're like, remember every amazing, cool, iconic thing
2510900	2511900	from the first 10 minutes of Alien?
2512900	2515900	You know how you've wondered for like 20 years, what's inside of that thing?
2515900	2516900	The cool thing is that I don't know.
2516900	2519900	What if what was inside of it was dudes?
2521900	2523900	Dudes and goo.
2523900	2524900	Dudes and goo.
2524900	2525900	Dudes and goo.
2525900	2530900	On the road this summer, dudes and goo, solving crimes.
2530900	2534900	This looks like a great place to build a Nakatomi Plaza.
2537900	2539900	Not a good movie.
2539900	2540900	Idea.
2542900	2549900	Ah, now these Indians are to rest in this burial ground, never to have a suburban home
2549900	2550900	built on it.
2556900	2559900	If we're Craig T. Nelson, we'll someday live.
2560900	2564900	I say, young one, you have done a very good job building this cemetery.
2564900	2566900	Let's go have a beer.
2567900	2568900	Our work is done.
2569900	2572900	And the young Craig T. Nelson gets the keys to the cemetery.
2572900	2573900	I'll do fine.
2575900	2576900	Oh, wait.
2576900	2577900	No, I'm sorry.
2577900	2578900	Craig T. Nelson, he was the hero in that movie.
2578900	2580900	He's so off on the villain, I forgot.
2580900	2581900	Fuck you guys.
2581900	2582900	Edit it up.
2582900	2584900	It's going to seem like I'm a god.
2584900	2588900	Also, edit out all the parts where I say I'm a god, because that makes me seem like not
2588900	2589900	a god.
2589900	2592900	How long until you're just walking around LA doing your normal business and you just
2592900	2594900	have an awkward interaction with like a barista or something?
2594900	2596900	You're like, edit this out, edit this out, edit this out.
2596900	2597900	I don't like this.
2597900	2598900	I'm a god.
2599900	2600900	I'm a god.
2600900	2601900	Edit it up.
2601900	2602900	Edit it out.
2603900	2604900	All right.
2604900	2605900	Well, thank you, DC Pearson.
2605900	2606900	Thanks for having me.
2606900	2607900	We appreciate it.
2607900	2608900	Is there anything else you want to say about your fucking...
2608900	2612900	Yeah, people should go to crapkingdom.com if they want to buy the book.
2612900	2613900	Please pre-order it.
2613900	2615900	I'm trying to get on the New York Times bestseller list.
2615900	2616900	It's a good book.
2616900	2617900	You'll enjoy it.
2617900	2618900	And then I'll write your name into a rap song.
2618900	2619900	How great would that be?
2619900	2621900	Why don't you write someone's name from here right now into a rap song?
2621900	2622900	Okay.
2622900	2623900	Sweet.
2623900	2624900	Let's do it.
2624900	2625900	Maddie's?
2625900	2626900	You got...
2626900	2627900	Do Maddie.
2627900	2628900	Maddie.
2628900	2629900	Maddie rap?
2629900	2630900	Uh, Maddie.
2631900	2632900	Yeah, Maddie.
2633900	2634900	I gotta fucking put my hood up for this shit.
2634900	2635900	Okay.
2635900	2637900	He's putting his rap hood on.
2637900	2638900	Rap hood's up.
2639900	2641900	Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.
2641900	2644900	Jeff Davis doesn't really know about baddies.
2644900	2648900	He seems to think that Hannibal is Lex Luthor.
2648900	2652900	But this thing, this show is the fucking truth, son.
2652900	2654900	And that's why I rap and that's why I rhyme.
2654900	2656900	And I did not have the right beat.
2656900	2658900	Time at the beginning of this rap about Maddie.
2658900	2660900	She wants to talk about cookies.
2660900	2661900	I will do so gladly.
2661900	2663900	We can talk about Keeblers.
2663900	2665900	Talk about Entomens.
2665900	2666900	Do they make cookies?
2666900	2667900	I think they did.
2667900	2668900	Yeah.
2669900	2673900	If you buy my book, I will write the raps in advance.
2675900	2676900	D.C. Pearson.
2676900	2677900	D.C. Pearson.
2677900	2678900	Bye, guys.
2678900	2679900	Thank you, sir.
2680900	2681900	Thank you, brother.
2683900	2684900	Crab Kingdom.
2688900	2689900	Yeah.
2689900	2690900	Yeah, man.
2690900	2691900	It's on autopilot.
2691900	2694900	I just bring cool people up and just let it rip.
2694900	2695900	Yeah?
2695900	2696900	How we doing on time, buddy?
2696900	2697900	We're doing good.
2697900	2698900	I think it might be time to bring up maybe somebody else.
2698900	2699900	Really?
2699900	2700900	Yeah.
2700900	2701900	And then let's segue into playing D&D.
2701900	2702900	Yeah.
2702900	2705900	So let's bring up one of my funniest friends in the world.
2706900	2708900	With one of the most adorable accents.
2709900	2713900	Who is often here lurking in the background but who has never been on stage here.
2713900	2714900	Which is a crime.
2714900	2715900	He's never been on our show, has he?
2715900	2716900	I don't think he's ever been up here.
2716900	2717900	No, no.
2717900	2720900	Let's welcome on stage Kumail Nanjiani, everybody.
2724900	2726900	Oh, yeah.
2732900	2733900	Hey.
2733900	2734900	How's it going?
2734900	2737900	I feel like there's a lot of pressure on my accent right now.
2737900	2738900	It's pretty adorable.
2738900	2739900	Is it?
2739900	2740900	Yeah, yeah.
2740900	2743900	I wonder if you could squeeze its little accent cheek.
2743900	2746900	It's called the 15 Years Out of Pakistan.
2746900	2747900	Yeah.
2747900	2748900	I like it.
2748900	2751900	It makes me feel fancy listening to you.
2752900	2756900	Oh, you guys were talking about pre- I always hate when they do like a movie where it's
2756900	2758900	like a kid version of somebody.
2758900	2759900	Like there was a movie.
2759900	2761900	I saw the preview and it was about British people.
2761900	2762900	I didn't know what it was.
2762900	2763900	And then this one scene where the mom was like,
2763900	2766900	come down for dinner, John Lennon.
2769900	2771900	And then you find out it's about John Lennon.
2771900	2772900	There's always like,
2772900	2777900	or like in fucking the new Batman movie that Joseph Gordon-Levitt's name is Robin.
2777900	2778900	That's his real name.
2778900	2779900	That's the fucking worst thing.
2779900	2783900	That is retarded with all due respect to my retarded sister,
2783900	2784900	which means I can say retarded.
2784900	2787900	Like that is so retarded.
2789900	2791900	That whole movie was an unbelievable.
2791900	2796900	That movie was like watching a guy trying to tie his shoe with a stack of teacups on his head.
2797900	2798900	And he's not good at it.
2798900	2799900	It's his first time.
2799900	2800900	Yeah.
2800900	2801900	Yeah.
2801900	2802900	Yeah.
2802900	2803900	Nothing like like you're just sitting there the whole time going,
2803900	2805900	well, I could do that.
2805900	2810900	Well, also is the end a dream sequence when he's actually in because Michael Caine,
2810900	2815900	they're in the same cafe that was in his dream.
2815900	2816900	That's a real cafe.
2816900	2820900	Michael Caine has a dream that one day he'll be at a restaurant drinking fernet branca.
2820900	2821900	Really?
2821900	2822900	Yeah.
2822900	2823900	Your favorite drink, Jeff.
2823900	2824900	Sweet.
2824900	2825900	Fernet Branca.
2825900	2829900	And he shares a dream with Christian Bale at one point and says,
2829900	2835900	I have a dream that one day I'll be in a restaurant and you won't be Batman anymore
2835900	2838900	and you'll be eating an omelet and I'll be having a fernet branca
2838900	2841900	and you won't even acknowledge me.
2841900	2843900	Why not?
2843900	2846900	You'd be like, Alfred, holy shit, I'm not Batman anymore.
2846900	2847900	Get over here.
2847900	2849900	Where are the fucking odds?
2849900	2850900	What the fuck are you drinking?
2850900	2851900	This is the one from your dream?
2851900	2853900	Fernet Branca's on the house?
2853900	2855900	Jesus fucking Christ.
2855900	2862900	Not only were you my fucking confidant and guy that sewed me up when I lost fights to supervillains,
2862900	2865900	on top of all that, you were my fucking butler.
2865900	2869900	Butler, that's already worth hanging out after we're retired.
2869900	2871900	Why would you ignore? Why?
2871900	2874900	I want to see all the scenes where they just go to random cafes,
2874900	2878900	like, all right, he's not at this one, let's keep going.
2878900	2881900	They had to go to hundreds of cafes.
2881900	2887900	And also, on top of it all, really, Alfred, dumb dream.
2887900	2889900	Stupid fantasy, dumb.
2889900	2892900	He'd just seen Good Will Hunting, so he was like...
2892900	2897900	He himself knows that some men just want to see the world burn.
2897900	2901900	He can't drum up a better fantasy than hanging out at a cafe.
2901900	2903900	He's a butler.
2903900	2907900	Well, he didn't do it for me.
2907900	2910900	The butler didn't do it.
2910900	2912900	I don't know, a lot of fucking...
2912900	2915900	A lot of ridiculous Alfred fans out in the audience.
2915900	2917900	Like, really, Alfred fans?
2917900	2921900	Did you guys really love Dark Knight Rises?
2921900	2925900	A couple people, you liked it? What's your name?
2925900	2926900	Rebecca.
2926900	2927900	Rebecca, you loved it?
2927900	2928900	I did.
2928900	2929900	I thought it was deep.
2929900	2931900	You thought it was deep?
2931900	2932900	That's very brave of you.
2932900	2934900	Did you just say you thought it was deep?
2934900	2935900	Well, don't...
2935900	2937900	Are you 14?
2937900	2938900	I'm sorry.
2938900	2941900	Let's walk a line between communicating with her and bullying her.
2941900	2942900	All right.
2942900	2944900	That's very brave of her to...
2944900	2945900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2945900	2946900	We're about bad cop.
2946900	2949900	Would you be willing to come up and talk about it a little bit?
2949900	2951900	Yeah, Rebecca, everybody.
2951900	2954900	Rebecca.
2954900	2956900	Here, take this.
2956900	2957900	That one?
2957900	2959900	Here, you take this mic.
2959900	2960900	Oh, wow.
2960900	2963900	God just gave me a microphone.
2964900	2966900	It's kind of my lifelong dream.
2966900	2967900	So you thought...
2967900	2970900	I haven't seen the film, so I cannot weigh in on this either way.
2970900	2974900	I was too busy reading literature.
2974900	2976900	Well, that's how Batman started.
2976900	2989900	Like many forms of literature, Batman, The Dark Knight Rises...
2989900	2992900	I feel like you haven't rehearsed this.
2993900	2996900	No, it grappled with some themes that I thought were deep.
2996900	2999900	What themes did you like?
2999900	3005900	Well, the striving for true freedom, like true human freedom,
3005900	3006900	out of the...
3006900	3007900	I do like that.
3007900	3011900	Like de-shackling ourselves from tyranny, whether...
3011900	3013900	But the villains were espousing that theme of...
3013900	3014900	Right?
3014900	3015900	That's exactly right.
3015900	3020900	Right, exactly, which is why I really thought it was like,
3020900	3025900	true revolution hasn't been really tried,
3025900	3029900	because every time humans have tried revolution,
3029900	3034900	the people who are making the revolution become the dictators,
3034900	3036900	and so it's exploring those themes.
3036900	3038900	I think I like this movie now.
3038900	3045900	Like how seductive the idea of what's anarchy is.
3045900	3047900	But I mean, you've seen Fight Club, right?
3047900	3051900	So just watch Fight Club again, like...
3051900	3052900	No, but...
3052900	3055900	But Fight Club doesn't have Batman in it.
3055900	3057900	Fair enough.
3057900	3060900	Every movie would be better with Batman in it.
3060900	3063900	Casablanca is great, but what if Batman showed up?
3063900	3065900	Well, that is true. That is absolutely true.
3065900	3067900	Thank you, Rebecca. Well done.
3067900	3069900	Thank you.
3069900	3071900	Thank you.
3071900	3074900	I don't want that heroism to go unnoticed.
3074900	3076900	I mean, that's fucking rough, man.
3076900	3077900	I'm trained in the society.
3077900	3080900	If there's like a, what do you call it, a zeitgeist
3080900	3084900	or a collective consensus that's being emitted by a groans
3084900	3088900	and someone bothers to go, you know, I don't know.
3088900	3090900	I know she was like...
3090900	3092900	I get really protective of those people,
3092900	3093900	because I'm like, God damn it,
3093900	3096900	that is what happened to all of us on the playground.
3096900	3099900	This is like a collection of people who all got picked on on the playground.
3099900	3101900	We were all on the business end of...
3101900	3105900	There's some really handsome, well-built guy in the back that's like,
3105900	3107900	fuck you.
3107900	3110900	Like, I come to Harmon Town for the fitness tips,
3110900	3114900	and now you're bullying me.
3114900	3116900	That's collateral damage.
3116900	3121900	You can stay here, Tad, but like nerds are nerds too.
3121900	3123900	You're welcome here, but anyways, whatever.
3123900	3124900	I was just speaking of ways.
3124900	3126900	I just think that's so cool that somebody would go like,
3126900	3129900	I like Batman Rising.
3129900	3133900	I insist on getting the title right.
3133900	3136900	So yeah, now's a good time as any to bring Spencer up to the stage,
3136900	3142900	so we have Spencer.
3142900	3146900	Yeah, I didn't really clarify that.
3146900	3149900	The reason Kumail is here is because Kumail, like,
3149900	3155900	very passionately, like, does this throw you into the bus in any weird reverse way?
3155900	3157900	Like, Kumail is always haunting the back.
3157900	3159900	He's the Phantom of Nerdmelt.
3159900	3162900	You make it sound like I've been very desperate to come up here.
3162900	3164900	No, no, no, no, no.
3164900	3165900	No, no, no, no.
3165900	3166900	Maybe it's my turn today.
3166900	3167900	No, no, no, no, no.
3167900	3171900	I'll go and dream of you in a cafe.
3171900	3173900	He's a professional stand-up with a very funny act.
3173900	3175900	He doesn't have to.
3175900	3176900	No, I like watching the show.
3176900	3177900	He doesn't crave the spotlight.
3177900	3180900	I'm saying specifically, you were very enamored
3180900	3182900	when we started bringing Spencer up and playing D&D.
3182900	3184900	And from the very get-go, you were like,
3184900	3185900	holy shit, what is this?
3185900	3186900	What is this?
3186900	3188900	I want to do this.
3188900	3191900	I've never played D&D, and it's like completely in my wheelhouse.
3191900	3193900	I just never played it.
3193900	3195900	I mean, I've played, like, RPG video games and stuff.
3195900	3197900	You seem like you should have played D&D, yeah.
3197900	3198900	That's not a compliment.
3198900	3199900	No, it's not.
3199900	3200900	No.
3200900	3202900	No, it's not.
3202900	3204900	We were at the drawing room, like, you know,
3204900	3206900	a couple weeks before the Harmon Town tour,
3206900	3209900	and you're like, I really want to, like, kind of hang out with Spencer.
3209900	3211900	I really want to play that game.
3211900	3212900	There was a fascination there.
3212900	3214900	Yeah, which is the same as Spencer saying
3214900	3216900	before he came to the first show that he came to,
3216900	3219900	I feel like I should be playing D&D with David Harmon
3220900	3221900	and then came to his show, and I said,
3221900	3224900	anyway, tension masters in the audience are going to be like,
3224900	3227900	I'm telling you, if you don't write the show,
3227900	3229900	God's writing it.
3229900	3231900	So this means you're going to be great at D&D.
3231900	3232900	I hope so.
3232900	3233900	That seems just as plausible,
3233900	3236900	not always Alfred running into Batman at the cafe, right?
3236900	3239900	But if God is writing the show and you're God,
3239900	3241900	the show is being written.
3241900	3242900	By me.
3242900	3243900	By you.
3243900	3246900	But, like, off the cuff.
3246900	3247900	Okay.
3247900	3249900	Who made that noise?
3249900	3251900	That's a weird noise.
3251900	3253900	What was that noise?
3253900	3255900	It sounded like theme music.
3255900	3259900	That's your villain, the dumb, dumb, dumb.
3259900	3261900	Spencer, how are you doing, babe?
3261900	3262900	I'm doing so good.
3262900	3263900	I called you babe.
3263900	3264900	I just called you babe.
3264900	3265900	Did you catch that?
3265900	3267900	I'm kind of a babe.
3271900	3272900	Actually, as I say that,
3272900	3276900	I realized I'm wearing my iD20 Spencer pin.
3276900	3278900	Am I a hard Spencer?
3278900	3279900	It's true.
3279900	3280900	He is.
3280900	3281900	It's a goodie.
3281900	3282900	I bet Spencer does okay.
3282900	3283900	What?
3283900	3284900	I bet you do okay, right?
3284900	3285900	No.
3287900	3289900	See me after the show.
3291900	3293900	He'll explain to you.
3293900	3294900	I'll tell you why.
3294900	3296900	I have a bulleted list.
3296900	3299900	At the top is I make bulleted lists.
3302900	3303900	Are you a list maker?
3303900	3304900	Oh, yeah.
3304900	3305900	It's awesome.
3305900	3308900	If I don't have a list, I'm thinking of everything.
3308900	3311900	I'm like, okay, I need new shoes at some point,
3311900	3313900	but today I've got to go to the bank,
3313900	3314900	and in a bit I have to do something,
3314900	3316900	and then there's someone I want to talk to.
3316900	3317900	If you have a little list,
3317900	3318900	it's not swirling around in your head.
3318900	3319900	It's just there.
3319900	3320900	Then you can think.
3320900	3324900	That terrifies me because when do you make the list?
3324900	3326900	Before you go to bed at night?
3326900	3327900	The second you think of a thing,
3327900	3330900	write it down in a list of stuff you have to do.
3330900	3332900	I want to be one of those people.
3333900	3335900	You can't do it with electronics.
3335900	3336900	You have to do it analog style.
3336900	3338900	You have to write it down.
3338900	3340900	Okay, all right.
3340900	3342900	Electronics are awesome,
3342900	3344900	but for writing a list,
3344900	3347900	you have to think I have a pencil in my pocket
3347900	3349900	with which to write down steps on a list.
3349900	3353900	I think this is actually the god baton being passed right now.
3357900	3358900	Spencer's Jesus and I'm God,
3358900	3362900	and Jeff is Ralph.
3362900	3364900	And I'm Muslim.
3366900	3367900	I love Spencer.
3367900	3369900	I love my little paper notepad.
3369900	3372900	The physical act of writing something down
3372900	3374900	makes my brain remember it.
3374900	3375900	Typing it in, not so much.
3375900	3377900	Jesus is in the Quran, isn't he?
3377900	3380900	Doesn't he have a cameo or something?
3380900	3381900	No.
3381900	3382900	If we want to get into it,
3382900	3383900	someone's like, yes.
3383900	3385900	Who said that?
3385900	3386900	Are you...
3386900	3388900	I'm an atheist.
3389900	3391900	She's an atheist, okay.
3391900	3393900	Were you ever not an atheist?
3393900	3395900	No.
3395900	3396900	Okay.
3396900	3397900	You've read the Quran?
3397900	3398900	Yeah.
3398900	3400900	Just to be like, bullshit.
3402900	3403900	Yeah, Jesus is in the Quran.
3403900	3406900	The only difference is that once he dies,
3406900	3408900	he does not come back,
3408900	3410900	and he is not the son of God,
3410900	3412900	but he is a prophet.
3412900	3413900	Right.
3413900	3415900	You know, like in Jesus Christ Superstar,
3415900	3417900	which is the best telling of that myth
3417900	3418900	in the fucking world.
3418900	3419900	It's awesome.
3419900	3421900	It's a pretty heroic act to get fucking murdered
3421900	3423900	and be cool with it.
3423900	3424900	That's enough.
3424900	3425900	I don't need to then see you
3425900	3427900	at the grocery store the next day.
3427900	3430900	I don't need magic tricks.
3430900	3434900	Heroism is as simple as being human
3434900	3437900	and being cool with people beating the shit out of you.
3437900	3440900	And there were a lot of people that...
3440900	3441900	Anyways, all right.
3441900	3442900	Fuck it.
3442900	3443900	Are you Muslim?
3443900	3444900	Yeah.
3444900	3445900	Are you still practicing?
3445900	3447900	Can I not answer that?
3447900	3450900	Because people will listen to it.
3450900	3453900	And we're not the most laid back people.
3453900	3454900	Right.
3454900	3457900	That's not such a bummer.
3457900	3459900	Yeah, chill out Muslims.
3459900	3460900	No, no, no.
3460900	3461900	I mean, like, you know,
3461900	3463900	just people being bummed out about other people.
3463900	3465900	It's very hard for me to say...
3465900	3468900	Anybody to say anything about Islam
3468900	3470900	that isn't completely agreeing with Islam
3470900	3472900	is a very difficult thing.
3472900	3474900	Which is not to imply that that's what I would have said.
3474900	3475900	Right.
3475900	3478900	As a possibly very good Muslim.
3478900	3479900	Yeah.
3479900	3481900	Potentially perfect Muslim.
3481900	3483900	Perfect Muslim.
3483900	3484900	Joseph Campbell says,
3484900	3486900	like, religion loses its function
3486900	3488900	the minute it becomes opaque.
3488900	3490900	It's supposed to be like a stained glass window.
3490900	3492900	You can get as ornate as you want.
3492900	3493900	You're framing it,
3493900	3496900	because you're drawing the audience's attention
3496900	3497900	to a thing that's there
3497900	3499900	that they never notice otherwise.
3499900	3501900	So yes, get festive.
3501900	3502900	Get crazy.
3502900	3503900	Get ceremonial.
3503900	3505900	Get ritualistic.
3505900	3507900	But the moment it becomes opaque
3507900	3509900	and blocks the thing,
3509900	3511900	the very thing that you're supposed to be drawing the attention to,
3511900	3513900	which is this non-corporeal thing,
3513900	3515900	this light that shines through it.
3515900	3517900	Anyways, so if you're making a religion out there...
3517900	3520900	Yeah, it becomes all about ritual.
3520900	3523900	You know, try to keep one foot out.
3523900	3524900	That's the other...
3524900	3526900	It's like the hokey pokey religion.
3526900	3530900	It's important to kind of straddle, I think,
3530900	3533900	the line between the Bible being a newspaper
3533900	3536900	and Dungeons and Dragons.
3536900	3538900	And that goes for atheists, too, by the way.
3538900	3541900	Like, your Bible is science,
3541900	3543900	which is a fucking great religion,
3543900	3545900	because it's a bunch of priests joining hands
3545900	3546900	and looking for the unknown.
3546900	3549900	But the whole point is that there's something that's unknown.
3549900	3550900	Sorry.
3550900	3552900	Fuck. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
3552900	3553900	Why were you sorry?
3553900	3555900	You said you were going to get deep.
3555900	3559900	You kept talking about religion and politics,
3559900	3562900	and you kept getting deep, and you kept apologizing for it.
3562900	3566900	The reason politics and religion are party breakers
3566900	3569900	is because you're not really talking about yourself,
3569900	3572900	because the reason they're called politics and religion
3572900	3575900	is because you're not actually expressing the way that you feel.
3575900	3579900	And you just saw firsthand the result
3579900	3583900	of an individual being unable to...
3583900	3585900	There's political reasons.
3585900	3589900	There's religious reasons why an individual can't say,
3589900	3591900	I'd like a ham sandwich.
3591900	3593900	I think the weather's nice today.
3593900	3595900	This is how I feel about stealing.
3595900	3597900	This is how I feel about capital punishment.
3597900	3600900	And for that same reason, it's kind of a...
3600900	3602900	You know, when you get in your pulpit, you're like...
3602900	3606900	There's a fine line between being honest and being dishonest.
3606900	3609900	It's when you start speaking for other people,
3609900	3611900	and it's...
3611900	3614900	I was just saying something like...
3614900	3618900	Joseph Campbell, who I think was a really smart guy,
3618900	3623900	said about religion, and he was super Catholic but super smart,
3623900	3626900	which too many people think is a contradiction in terms.
3626900	3628900	And it doesn't have to be.
3628900	3634900	Like, religion can actually be a smart person's tool
3634900	3636900	to dealing with the cosmos.
3637900	3639900	That's a personal feeling that I'm sharing,
3639900	3641900	not a political or...
3641900	3645900	It's not the equivalent of being at a party
3645900	3648900	and going like, this is that, and God wears a hat,
3648900	3650900	and he doesn't.
3650900	3652900	I'm sharing that idea.
3652900	3657900	It doesn't have to be true to you for you and I to get along.
3657900	3660900	It's just an interesting thing to think about,
3660900	3665900	that humankind made these religions...
3666900	3669900	Our brains are capable of doing that,
3669900	3673900	that is neither something to take too seriously,
3673900	3675900	because we also make poop,
3675900	3679900	and we learn to flush that the fuck down the toilet,
3679900	3685900	and that was a great day that doubled our lifespan as a species.
3685900	3687900	Also, you didn't have to look at shit.
3687900	3691900	But it's also something to not totally disregard,
3691900	3693900	because when you look at your shit,
3693900	3697900	if there's blood in it, that's a clue.
3699900	3702900	So, human beings make things, you know?
3702900	3703900	We make shit.
3703900	3705900	That makes us different from leopards.
3705900	3708900	And leopards alone, that's the only animal.
3708900	3710900	If you're a leopard and you're listening,
3710900	3712900	I'm coming after you.
3712900	3714900	Stop fucking goldbricking.
3714900	3716900	Start making shit, leopards.
3716900	3719900	Get off of that limb and do some shit.
3720900	3725900	Stop wisely displaying yourself on a branch
3725900	3727900	and waiting for a wounded gazelle.
3727900	3730900	Where's your iPad, you know?
3730900	3734900	No, because Islam is definitely about rejecting the body
3734900	3736900	and embracing the spirit,
3736900	3738900	and I think that's one of the...
3738900	3740900	If I were to speak my mind,
3740900	3743900	I would say that suppression of the body,
3743900	3745900	it can be a big mistake,
3745900	3749900	it can come out in very aggressive, violent ways.
3749900	3751900	Yeah, it can also be a super cool thing.
3751900	3754900	I stopped jerking off when my sex life with Aaron has improved greatly.
3754900	3756900	Oh, so you've been having sex.
3756900	3758900	You just haven't been jerking off.
3758900	3760900	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3762900	3763900	If I didn't have a girlfriend,
3763900	3766900	I wouldn't bother to experiment with not jerking off.
3766900	3767900	That's ridiculous.
3767900	3769900	If I didn't have a girlfriend,
3769900	3772900	I would invent new ways to jerk off.
3772900	3774900	I would be telling these people,
3774900	3778900	if you take a hammock and a rotisserie grill...
3778900	3780900	How big is your house?
3782900	3785900	Even a leopard, if you couldn't fuck another leopard,
3785900	3788900	he would invent new jerk-off methods.
3789900	3791900	So you're just... Okay, yeah.
3791900	3794900	Yeah, it's a little less heroic than you made it sound at the beginning.
3794900	3798900	Yeah, you're constantly having sex and jerking off, usually.
3799900	3803900	When you're having sex, do you jerk off to finish during the sex?
3803900	3805900	I don't think that counts as jerking off.
3805900	3806900	No, sometimes I would, yeah.
3806900	3808900	Sometimes I would, and that's part of the thing.
3808900	3811900	When you get into that thing, your brain gets into...
3811900	3813900	Maddie, leave the room.
3814900	3815900	I don't know.
3815900	3819900	I can't believe this started with Joseph Campbell's views on religion.
3820900	3823900	And that same exact thought.
3823900	3825900	This is the same thought.
3826900	3828900	Do you jerk off when you finish sex?
3828900	3830900	Oh, yeah, sometimes, you know.
3833900	3835900	We're like the view without the order.
3837900	3838900	Yeah, I like it.
3838900	3841900	I think that stuff belongs in the same conversation.
3841900	3842900	No, I think so, too.
3842900	3843900	I think so, too.
3844900	3847900	We're all about suppression of sex, sexual drive.
3847900	3850900	And I truly... Yeah, I mean, we live in a world of...
3850900	3852900	Even like appetites, food, everything.
3852900	3855900	There's six billion people in the world, so now, at this point,
3855900	3858900	if you started to lower your guard, there's a million predators
3858900	3860900	that would immediately do shady shit.
3860900	3862900	Same thing with legalizing drugs, all this shit.
3862900	3865900	But that's the problem of the momentum that we've had.
3865900	3868900	The truth is, on a technical basis,
3868900	3871900	the truth is, I think we've learned this, and we all know this,
3871900	3874900	we just don't know how to put it in practice,
3874900	3880900	that the less inhibitions and the more self-policing you allow,
3881900	3882900	the more people...
3882900	3885900	Or you just acknowledge that it's a thing instead of just suppressing
3885900	3887900	and not even... I mean, I never...
3887900	3889900	I literally never got the sex talk.
3889900	3893900	I learned sex, what sex was, from watching a porno
3893900	3896900	and being like, this is very wrong.
3898900	3900900	And I had a fever for three days.
3900900	3901900	I really did.
3901900	3904900	And nobody... There's no sex education in Pakistan at all.
3904900	3908900	Yeah, we've talked about it over and over and over again in our society.
3908900	3911900	It's plain as day. We talk about it in history class,
3911900	3915900	how prohibition gave rise to an entire organized crime kingdom
3915900	3919900	of terrible alcohol that would make you blind if you drank it.
3919900	3921900	You make something against the law.
3921900	3923900	That's how we are with sex right now.
3923900	3926900	We're in Pakistan having sex that wouldn't make us blind.
3928900	3931900	Bad shit is going on behind closed doors.
3931900	3934900	I mean, I'll represent the West, though,
3934900	3936900	and say we get a lot of senators in a lot of airplane stalls
3936900	3939900	doing a lot of weird airport stalls.
3942900	3946900	The bottom line is when the distance between what's going on in your head
3946900	3950900	and what's coming out of your mouth, like how shameful is it?
3950900	3953900	What are you thinking that's so fucking bad that if you said it,
3953900	3955900	something bad would happen to you?
3955900	3957900	What is the bad thing that would happen to you?
3957900	3959900	Would you not be allowed to be a senator?
3959900	3961900	Hey, maybe that means it's a shitty job.
3961900	3964900	Maybe that means you shouldn't be a fucking senator.
3965900	3967900	There's so much shit to do out there.
3967900	3970900	Go dig a goddamn hole. Put a flower in it.
3970900	3974900	You can do that. Think all kinds of shit about octopi.
3976900	3980900	Stop listening to your parents tell you you're supposed to be a senator.
3980900	3982900	Mom, Dad, I want a fucking octopus.
3982900	3984900	I want to fuck it real bad.
3986900	3988900	I want a fucking octopus so bad,
3988900	3991900	I want to feel all eight tendrils just wrapping me.
3991900	3996900	I just want to fucking cum inside this fucking thing, this cephalopod.
3996900	4000900	I know I can't make it pregnant, but I just see him on TV
4000900	4003900	and I just fucking, my cock, it's hard as Gibraltar.
4003900	4008900	I don't want to make the laws for Louisiana.
4008900	4010900	I'm not fit to do it.
4010900	4012900	Give the job to a guy that doesn't want the job.
4012900	4015900	It's civil service. It's not royalty.
4015900	4017900	Are you implying that he was in the stall,
4017900	4020900	he was hoping an octopus would happen?
4020900	4023900	That's the point of the glory hole, it could be anything you want it to be.
4023900	4025900	That's exactly right.
4025900	4028900	Just bite down on pretend there's a beak.
4029900	4033900	I always think fucking an octopus would be a tough way to go, man.
4033900	4034900	Yeah.
4034900	4036900	There's some shit inside there that you don't want fucking anything to do with.
4036900	4038900	Well, I know, but there's so much suction cups, like all of the suction cups.
4038900	4039900	That'd be good.
4039900	4040900	You haven't even thought about this.
4040900	4042900	Yeah, but the beak, I'm just, I go right to the beak.
4042900	4044900	That thing is supposed to be like, you just crack a fucking stone.
4044900	4047900	Octopus's hand job. Like, think about it.
4048900	4052900	A million blowjobs wrapped around your deck at the same time.
4052900	4054900	That is heaven.
4054900	4057900	A million blowjobs wrapped around your deck.
4057900	4058900	Yeah.
4058900	4060900	That is very poetic.
4060900	4063900	That's a new, I should give credit where credit,
4063900	4066900	that is the slogan for the new Dairy Queen shake.
4068900	4073900	Also, Occupy have an ability to fill any tiny little crevice.
4073900	4075900	Yeah, they can like, yeah.
4076900	4079900	I bet they could go right up your dime-sized butthole.
4079900	4080900	Right up your asshole.
4080900	4083900	Get in there and just fucking, there's suction in your prostate.
4083900	4084900	Just to let you have it.
4084900	4086900	Oh, they'd be squirreling around in there?
4086900	4087900	Yeah.
4087900	4090900	They could fit through any hole that's at least as big as their eyeball.
4090900	4094900	So if your asshole is bigger than an octopus's eyeball,
4095900	4097900	you're having a great day.
4100900	4103900	You go octopus shopping, and you're like,
4103900	4105900	a smaller eye, please.
4108900	4109900	Sir.
4111900	4113900	Sir, what are you intending to do with this?
4113900	4117900	Oh, there's like a trial room in the back that you have to try.
4117900	4120900	Yeah, there's an ophthalmologist thinking you put your chin on a thing
4120900	4122900	and it's got a little, measures your eyeball.
4122900	4125900	And I go, I think I know exactly what you're looking for.
4126900	4128900	So what's better, this or this?
4129900	4131900	All right.
4132900	4134900	Somebody's got to be the fun police.
4135900	4137900	Let's play some D&D for Fox Pick, shall we?
4137900	4138900	Yeah.
4139900	4140900	Is Aaron here?
4140900	4141900	Yeah, Aaron's...
4141900	4142900	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
4142900	4143900	Aaron McGathey.
4146900	4147900	Does Aaron have a mic?
4147900	4148900	Is there a mic for Aaron?
4148900	4149900	Do we have an extra mic?
4150900	4151900	Emily's on the job.
4151900	4152900	Okay.
4153900	4154900	Emily Gordon.
4154900	4155900	Hello, Aaron.
4155900	4156900	Hey, fun show, guys.
4158900	4162900	Do you ever think of wearing more sweaters with like multiple sleeves?
4167900	4170900	Like six extra sleeves.
4173900	4177900	I don't think about that, but I do think about constructing like a really hard beak.
4177900	4179900	Like a tie around my head.
4179900	4181900	It'd be like a Bane mask.
4182900	4184900	Emily, Camille's wife, was just telling me backstage,
4184900	4187900	you know, Camille's weirdly obsessed with Octopus, with Octopi.
4187900	4188900	Okay.
4191900	4195900	The nature of my obsession is slightly different from the context that we...
4195900	4196900	It starts with the Quran.
4198900	4199900	I am obsessed.
4199900	4201900	They're like very...
4209900	4211900	Get him a towel for Fox Pick, he's sweating.
4212900	4214900	Give me eight towels.
4217900	4221900	They're actually hyper-smart, and they can learn to open jars.
4222900	4223900	And love.
4224900	4226900	They can predict the elections.
4226900	4229900	They can predict elections and seasons.
4229900	4232900	And one scientist actually had this...
4232900	4237900	And, you know, he had this Octopus in his, like, aquarium, but it was open.
4237900	4238900	It was like his pet.
4238900	4242900	And he came in one day, and the Octopus was out of the aquarium,
4242900	4244900	and they can learn to mimic humans.
4244900	4245900	What?
4246900	4247900	No, they mimic...
4247900	4248900	He's wearing a lab coat.
4248900	4249900	It's on his way to the parking lot.
4251900	4255900	It's like the end of Silence of the Land, just putting on a hat and going into Panama.
4255900	4258900	He was shoving another Octopus up its ass.
4261900	4266900	No, he came in and he saw the Octopus, like, just flipping through a book.
4267900	4270900	Which, at that point, you just fucking killed yourself.
4271900	4273900	Like, you knew how to use the book.
4273900	4277900	It had seen the scientists flipping pages, and so it was just there, like,
4277900	4280900	Oh, hey, that is weird.
4280900	4282900	Needs more character development.
4282900	4285900	I was at an airport, and there was a flight delay,
4285900	4288900	and there was a child with a mother and father,
4288900	4292900	and the child was probably, I'd say, two and a half, three.
4292900	4296900	And there was a magazine, and the kid was wandering around and bothering everybody,
4296900	4299900	and found, like, a Newsweek, and put it on his lap,
4299900	4302900	and started running its finger across it like an iPad,
4302900	4305900	and couldn't master magazine technology.
4305900	4308900	It's a sub-Octopus human.
4308900	4309900	Sit there, buddy.
4309900	4310900	Oh, sure?
4310900	4311900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4311900	4317900	I always thought, we're running along, but the concept of intelligence,
4317900	4320900	it's just nerve clusters.
4321900	4323900	We have these giant brains, which I am a huge fan of.
4323900	4325900	I am on our species' side.
4325900	4328900	I think that we need to decide, right or wrong,
4328900	4330900	whether God made a mistake making us this way,
4330900	4332900	like these super-intelligent monkeys.
4332900	4333900	It was a fucking gamble.
4333900	4336900	We've been in the planet's crosshairs for so long.
4336900	4340900	It's tough titties that were given a little back,
4340900	4342900	and we can straighten up our aim,
4342900	4344900	but it's like, we're a hard species to keep alive,
4344900	4347900	because we're a fucking huge, like, double-zero bet
4347900	4349900	on the roulette wheel of biological warfare.
4349900	4352900	Like, the idea of just flooding this cranium
4352900	4356900	with this folded-over grotesque giant plate of spaghetti
4356900	4359900	that has sentient thought and makes decisions
4359900	4361900	and is conscious of its own fucking death,
4361900	4363900	like, meanwhile, ants are like,
4363900	4365900	nah, we'll stick with what's working,
4365900	4367900	and they'll probably beat us.
4367900	4368900	Like, they will.
4368900	4369900	They've been around for so long.
4369900	4371900	They don't have depression.
4371900	4373900	They're not things.
4373900	4375900	We look at them, and you step on one ant,
4375900	4377900	and you go, like, that poor thing, or I feel bad,
4377900	4379900	or I feel great because I got fired today.
4379900	4382900	But it's like, the fucking ant doesn't care that much,
4382900	4385900	and yet it's part of this gigantic fucking
4385900	4388900	incredibly sophisticated organism called an ant colony
4388900	4393900	that is the actual, that's the actual species,
4393900	4394900	is the colony.
4394900	4396900	It's not Mike, like, the plumber.
4396900	4398900	It's like, the little things you're seeing,
4398900	4401900	they're just like, anyways,
4401900	4402900	like, the idea of intelligence,
4402900	4404900	like, we're obsessed with the idea that,
4404900	4406900	oh, of course you'd evolve towards that,
4406900	4409900	but this octopus knows how to pretend to read a book.
4409900	4411900	Well, let's do some wishful filming right now,
4411900	4413900	and let Kameil play some D&D for pity's sake, shall we?
4413900	4415900	Spencer?
4415900	4419900	Oh, sir, get us up to date.
4419900	4422900	Slowly, he hands out his character sheets.
4422900	4426900	Prematurely, Jeff hits the Spencer theme, not knowing.
4426900	4429900	Dan does his impression of Spencer.
4429900	4432900	He doesn't know whether Spencer likes it or not.
4432900	4434900	He's been doing it a lot.
4434900	4440900	Spencer finds it just fine before resuming his introduction.
4440900	4443900	When we last met after almost spending an entire tour
4443900	4445900	trapped within its fleshy confines,
4445900	4449900	our heroes had slain the mighty Infinifish.
4449900	4452900	The party was flung out onto the ground of a strange land.
4452900	4454900	After pulling themselves up,
4454900	4456900	the party surveyed the landscape.
4456900	4458900	The surrounding plants and trees were tremendous,
4458900	4461900	emanating powerful and strange presences.
4461900	4464900	The violet sky was full of orange balls of light
4464900	4467900	bouncing and bobbing in the sky like bubbles.
4467900	4470900	The Infinifish corpse lay in the strange forest
4470900	4473900	strewn about the felled trees composing its deathbed.
4473900	4477900	Soon the party was accosted by a strange pair wielding axes
4477900	4480900	who took the party to their camp after a tense introduction.
4480900	4482900	Just then, a misty fog rolled in,
4482900	4485900	addling the minds of all parties involved
4485900	4488900	and causing them to act strangely for a time.
4488900	4490900	Yeah, that was fucked up.
4490900	4492900	That was some Virginia Woolf shit.
4492900	4494900	The pair explained they had been searching
4494900	4497900	for a rare legendary artifact known as the Soul of Growth,
4497900	4500900	progenitor of all plant life and natural energy in the Multiverse.
4500900	4503900	The mysterious entity ruse rumored to be Antwyla,
4503900	4505900	the plain of Agile's forest.
4505900	4507900	They fucked around for a while.
4507900	4509900	Then, in a fit of progress,
4509900	4512900	the barbarian fled south in hopes of finding the Soul of Growth
4512900	4514900	through sheer coincidence.
4514900	4518900	The rest of the ragtag group trailing behind.
4518900	4520900	Thank you, Spencer.
4525900	4527900	I want to ask a sidebar question
4527900	4529900	about the inhabitants of the infinifish
4529900	4534900	that we had met and learned to relate to.
4534900	4536900	Are they all dead?
4536900	4540900	Imagine an infinitely long fish, right?
4540900	4542900	No problem.
4542900	4546900	If you exploded out of it at point A
4546900	4549900	and you were farther along than they were,
4549900	4552900	they were spit out at some unknown point X if they survived.
4552900	4554900	So even if they did, there would be no way of you guys
4554900	4556900	really knowing you were pretty far down the fish.
4556900	4558900	Oh, so it's like lost.
4558900	4560900	Like if we need them, we'll find out
4560900	4562900	that the tail section crashed somewhere else.
4562900	4564900	Or if you cared, you know, last episode,
4564900	4566900	you probably would have tried to look for them
4566900	4568900	and maybe found them.
4568900	4570900	I mean, I'm just saying,
4570900	4572900	what you want to do happens.
4572900	4574900	Hey, listen, man.
4575900	4579900	Those two guys, they paid $1,000 to play D&D.
4579900	4581900	I was so concerned with making that.
4581900	4584900	Is there 1,000 actual dollars?
4584900	4587900	And they got up there and nothing happened.
4587900	4590900	Aaron alternately killed them and made up with them
4590900	4592900	four times and it was really wild.
4592900	4594900	Nobody knew what was going on.
4594900	4597900	I wanted them to kill you, but they didn't want to.
4597900	4599900	Wait, why did you want them to kill us?
4599900	4601900	It would be a good prize.
4602900	4604900	Well, they only had one day.
4604900	4607900	Also, I met a horse.
4607900	4609900	Yeah, Coco.
4609900	4611900	Kumail, I have a horse now.
4611900	4613900	What's the horse's name?
4613900	4614900	Coco.
4614900	4615900	Yep.
4617900	4619900	Is it like just a horse horse
4619900	4621900	or like a talking horse?
4621900	4623900	I mean, I can understand her.
4623900	4625900	Is she just a horse? No.
4627900	4629900	But technically, yes.
4629900	4631900	Just so much more to you than a horse.
4631900	4632900	Yes, yes.
4632900	4634900	So I was trying to leave this group, right?
4634900	4638900	So you struck off south and the team...
4638900	4640900	In search of the soul of growth.
4640900	4642900	And the team just kind of followed along
4642900	4644900	because that seemed like a cool idea.
4644900	4647900	Well, if I said that I was in a blackout drunk,
4647900	4650900	what I really want to do is root around and see if...
4650900	4653900	My concern is for the people that were in that fish,
4653900	4655900	like were covered in viscera.
4655900	4658900	I'm going to root around a little bit and see if I can find them.
4659900	4662900	Okay, so like in the fish, around the fish,
4662900	4665900	or just in general, anywhere on this forest?
4665900	4668900	Well, we landed in a big pile of fish goo.
4668900	4669900	True.
4669900	4671900	I'm looking for more fish wreckage.
4671900	4673900	I'll take the outer perimeter.
4673900	4677900	Coco and I will trot around the outer perimeter
4677900	4678900	looking for people.
4678900	4681900	Okay, so you could go either east or west.
4681900	4682900	I go east.
4682900	4685900	You go east along the side of the fish.
4685900	4687900	You travel quite some way,
4687900	4691900	but you feel that the fish goes on for infinity.
4691900	4693900	It's a long fish, Coco.
4693900	4697900	You see no split on the side of the fish.
4697900	4700900	If there was anyone spat out, it wasn't here.
4702900	4704900	You feel like it'd take several days
4704900	4707900	to actually go through the whole length of this fish.
4707900	4708900	Can I ask a question?
4708900	4711900	Why are you guys looking for people who have fallen out of the fish?
4711900	4712900	They didn't even.
4712900	4713900	They just lived in it.
4714900	4716900	What's your concern, Dan, about these people?
4716900	4717900	Why are you guys looking for them?
4717900	4719900	They're human beings.
4719900	4720900	Oh, okay.
4720900	4723900	What in the hell am I...
4723900	4726900	What kind of world is this?
4728900	4729900	All right, okay.
4729900	4732900	Just a concern for your human...
4732900	4734900	For humanity!
4734900	4735900	All right, got it.
4735900	4737900	I don't understand.
4738900	4742900	So what way are you heading, uh, Sharpie?
4742900	4745900	You're looking for people, but you didn't.
4745900	4747900	Well, now I lost my friend.
4747900	4748900	It's true.
4748900	4750900	I'm looking for the soul of growth.
4750900	4752900	I'm on my way south, baby.
4752900	4753900	You head south.
4753900	4756900	The trees get taller and thicker.
4756900	4758900	There doesn't really seem to be a path,
4758900	4761900	but soon you come across a massive thicket of trees
4761900	4764900	that walls off any remaining progress.
4765900	4767900	The ground before you is littered with bones
4767900	4769900	and bits of flesh and pieces of metal
4769900	4771900	and little scraps of things
4771900	4773900	as well as half-eating animals.
4773900	4776900	I try to detect a trap around me.
4776900	4778900	You detect traps about.
4778900	4780900	You best be careful.
4780900	4782900	Okay, I stand perfectly still.
4782900	4783900	Good plan.
4784900	4786900	If you're rustling in the brush,
4786900	4788900	someone makes it through
4788900	4791900	the thick tangle of trees in the plain view.
4791900	4792900	He calls out,
4792900	4794900	watch out for those traps.
4794900	4795900	They'll get you.
4797900	4799900	That's the introduction for a Koomells character
4799900	4801900	who wanders onto frame.
4805900	4807900	Who goes there?
4809900	4810900	Fennet?
4810900	4811900	If you want to change your name,
4811900	4813900	I just write random things.
4813900	4814900	Fennet.
4814900	4815900	Yeah, like Fennet.
4815900	4816900	Okay, I'll change my name.
4816900	4817900	Do it.
4818900	4819900	Chris DeBerg.
4819900	4820900	Nice.
4821900	4822900	Chris DeBerg.
4823900	4825900	I wrote Lady in Red.
4825900	4826900	Oh shit.
4827900	4828900	I love that.
4828900	4829900	It's a great song.
4829900	4830900	It is a good song.
4830900	4831900	God.
4832900	4834900	Wait, you wrote Lady in Red?
4834900	4835900	Yeah, man.
4836900	4837900	Shit's been bad.
4837900	4839900	Who sang it though?
4839900	4840900	Who sang Lady in Red?
4840900	4841900	I sang it also.
4841900	4842900	You sang it too.
4842900	4843900	That's one of those guys
4843900	4845900	that you never know who sang that song.
4845900	4846900	That's great.
4846900	4847900	It was me, Chris DeBerg.
4847900	4849900	What are you doing in this thick forest
4849900	4851900	surrounded by traps?
4851900	4853900	Shit got fucked, man.
4854900	4856900	You know, so that was a big song.
4856900	4857900	It was really good.
4857900	4858900	And I was like...
4863900	4864900	But you must have got
4864900	4865900	all the royalties off that, right?
4865900	4867900	Yeah, I mean, a lot.
4867900	4868900	But you know what happened was
4868900	4869900	they started having proms
4869900	4871900	themed around my song.
4871900	4873900	Never sent me royalty checks for that.
4873900	4875900	And I thought I could write that theme forever,
4875900	4877900	so there was a Lady in Pink,
4877900	4879900	which I'm sure you've never heard of.
4879900	4880900	No.
4880900	4881900	See, you can't go back to the well.
4881900	4882900	Lady in Yellow.
4882900	4885900	There was a Dude in Red, which...
4885900	4887900	Have you ever heard of Dudes and Goo?
4888900	4890900	No, I've been here a long time.
4890900	4891900	Oh, yeah?
4891900	4893900	So what brings you out here?
4893900	4895900	What are you up to?
4895900	4897900	Well, there's a lot of traps around.
4897900	4898900	Are they your traps?
4898900	4900900	No, I didn't set these traps.
4900900	4902900	I wish I could afford traps.
4903900	4904900	Got it.
4905900	4906900	Do you need some money?
4906900	4907900	Are you hungry?
4907900	4908900	What do you need, man?
4908900	4910900	Money would be great.
4910900	4912900	I give them a couple small coins
4912900	4914900	to get them for the day, Spencer.
4914900	4917900	The only trap I fell into was my own ineptitude
4917900	4919900	with financial.
4919900	4920900	You know, the music industry, man,
4920900	4921900	it's really wild.
4921900	4923900	It's brutal.
4924900	4926900	Can I...
4926900	4928900	I have a question about my spell Detect Thoughts.
4928900	4931900	Am I able to use that to find
4931900	4933900	friends?
4933900	4934900	You'd be able to...
4934900	4936900	So if someone was behind a wall thinking,
4936900	4937900	you'd be able to...
4937900	4939900	I'd go, oh, that's Stan's thoughts.
4939900	4941900	But it's not a huge range.
4941900	4942900	So you'd be able to...
4942900	4944900	All minds come to me or whatever.
4944900	4945900	You know what?
4945900	4949900	Coco and I track down Sharpie and scoop him.
4949900	4951900	Rejoining your compatriot.
4951900	4953900	You scoop him up into a horse.
4953900	4955900	Hey, I don't think finding these people
4955900	4957900	that lived in the fish is...
4957900	4960900	It doesn't seem to be a narratively profitable adventure.
4960900	4961900	I agree.
4961900	4963900	But I think that everybody noted
4963900	4965900	what a great humanitarian you are.
4965900	4966900	Thank you.
4966900	4968900	That's honestly what's important.
4968900	4970900	More important than the lives themselves, yeah.
4970900	4972900	Are there any animals around me, Spencer,
4972900	4974900	that I can talk to?
4974900	4975900	I mean...
4975900	4976900	I'm here.
4976900	4978900	Not an animal.
4978900	4980900	Like woodland creatures or anything.
4980900	4982900	I mean, you don't see any right.
4982900	4984900	You could maybe do a call or something.
4984900	4985900	I do a squirrel.
4985900	4986900	Squirrel.
4986900	4988900	Squirrel call.
4989900	4991900	Do I have any... I just...
4992900	4994900	You think magic is dumb if I recall correctly.
4994900	4995900	Yeah.
4995900	4997900	You have some science items
4997900	4999900	that are made with alchemy and whatnot,
4999900	5001900	but they're not so much magical.
5001900	5003900	Yeah, so Chris...
5003900	5004900	What's your name?
5004900	5005900	I'm Korp...
5008900	5009900	What do you do for a living?
5009900	5010900	I got a great new idea for a song.
5010900	5011900	Oh, yeah?
5011900	5012900	Korp in red.
5012900	5013900	See, look.
5014900	5015900	Look, I'm just a known barbarian.
5015900	5017900	I'm out for adventure
5017900	5019900	and for profit,
5019900	5021900	but I really think you need to not
5021900	5023900	keep going back to that same idea.
5023900	5024900	I don't know.
5024900	5025900	It really worked great, that one.
5025900	5027900	I know, but like, yeah, but like...
5027900	5029900	But it's like, you know, like...
5029900	5030900	You heard the song, right?
5030900	5031900	Chubby Checker.
5031900	5032900	Alien Red.
5032900	5033900	Chubby Checker.
5033900	5034900	She's dancing with me, chick to chick.
5034900	5035900	Name a Chubby Checker song.
5035900	5036900	Doing a twist, right?
5036900	5037900	Yeah.
5037900	5038900	Then he tried to rewrite the twist a thousand times
5038900	5039900	and they all sucked, you know?
5039900	5041900	It's like, learn from Chubby Checker.
5041900	5043900	Like, what's on your mind?
5043900	5044900	Like, what's...
5044900	5046900	Like, some actual pain?
5046900	5048900	I have an idea for a new song.
5048900	5049900	Okay.
5049900	5050900	It's about...
5050900	5051900	Is it about being in a color?
5051900	5052900	It's gonna be about, like, you meet someone
5052900	5055900	and then it's like, call me maybe, you know?
5056900	5057900	Okay.
5057900	5058900	So that'll be the song.
5058900	5059900	I like that.
5059900	5060900	Yeah.
5060900	5061900	What's better than that?
5061900	5062900	Yeah.
5062900	5063900	Anyway.
5063900	5064900	Call me maybe.
5067900	5069900	That is just to change subjects briefly.
5069900	5071900	I'm looking for the soul of growth.
5071900	5073900	Do you know anything about that?
5073900	5074900	Do I?
5075900	5077900	Do you want me to fill him in?
5077900	5078900	Yeah.
5078900	5079900	What is the soul of growth?
5079900	5080900	Possess your character.
5080900	5081900	Yeah.
5081900	5083900	The soul of growth is a rumored artifact
5083900	5085900	that's, you know, supposed to be on Twyla.
5085900	5087900	That's this plane we're on, you see?
5088900	5091900	It's rumored to be able to create life
5091900	5093900	and birth even, you know, planes
5093900	5095900	and the magical plants
5095900	5097900	and all sorts of crazy shit.
5097900	5099900	Like, this whole forest used to just be
5099900	5102900	the soul of growth until it expanded.
5102900	5105900	So it's a pretty big deal around here.
5106900	5108900	So, yeah, I've heard of it.
5111900	5112900	Wait.
5112900	5114900	It's a pretty big deal around here.
5114900	5115900	Have you ever been there?
5115900	5117900	Could you show me the way?
5117900	5118900	Yeah.
5118900	5119900	If I...
5119900	5121900	You seem like you look a little down in your luck.
5121900	5122900	I've got some...
5122900	5123900	I got a sack of nuts.
5123900	5124900	I'll give you some nuts.
5124900	5125900	No, I'll give you some money.
5125900	5127900	No, it's like food, like actual nuts.
5129900	5131900	I can forage for nuts.
5131900	5133900	Like ham sandwiches.
5133900	5135900	Do I have any meat in my inventory?
5135900	5137900	You should have some, like, foodstuffs.
5137900	5138900	Okay.
5140900	5142900	I apply him with foodstuffs and say,
5142900	5144900	if you show me the way, I'll feed you.
5144900	5146900	I'll make sure that you...
5146900	5149900	We'll maybe collaborate on some songs together
5149900	5150900	and we'll go...
5150900	5151900	You know what?
5151900	5153900	Soul of Growth sounds like a great place
5153900	5155900	to get your career back on track.
5155900	5156900	Oh, my God.
5156900	5157900	That does.
5157900	5159900	Because that's what needs growth.
5159900	5160900	Yeah.
5160900	5161900	Your career.
5161900	5162900	Exactly.
5162900	5163900	All right.
5163900	5164900	If it can create a plane,
5164900	5166900	it could certainly write us a new song.
5166900	5167900	It needs to be a hit song.
5167900	5168900	I've written hundreds of songs.
5168900	5169900	Okay, but I just see...
5169900	5171900	Because I'm friending you just money and food off the top,
5171900	5173900	I get 80% of your back end.
5173900	5174900	That sounds like a good deal.
5174900	5175900	Okay, cool.
5178900	5180900	Do I actually know where it is?
5180900	5185900	I mean, you are aware that it's supposed to be in the shrine.
5185900	5186900	Yeah.
5186900	5188900	All right, I'll tell you.
5189900	5190900	Leave me there.
5190900	5191900	You're conversing.
5191900	5192900	Yeah, okay.
5192900	5195900	Riding on the back of Mulrain's horse, Coco,
5195900	5197900	her hair whipping into my face,
5197900	5205900	the horse's rhythms gyrating my gyrations.
5205900	5210900	I ask her to stop the horse for a moment.
5210900	5212900	Mulrain, stop.
5212900	5214900	Yes.
5214900	5219900	It's only been so long since you've turned into a woman.
5219900	5221900	But we are in a different dimension.
5221900	5225900	I feel like the rules don't apply.
5225900	5228900	I want to make love to you.
5228900	5232900	Right now in the dirt while this horse watches.
5237900	5239900	I heard through the wind that you've been abstaining
5239900	5241900	from pledging yourself.
5241900	5243900	For you.
5243900	5246900	And for my magic.
5246900	5252900	It actually adds a point of damage to my ray of frost.
5252900	5253900	Well, yes.
5253900	5256900	Let's do it in the dirt as long as we can do it underneath Coco,
5256900	5258900	underneath her shade.
5258900	5259900	Okay.
5259900	5260900	I mean, it's a well-trained horse, right?
5260900	5261900	That's not going to step on me.
5261900	5262900	No, no.
5262900	5263900	She won't do any of that.
5263900	5264900	She'll watch, but she won't move.
5264900	5266900	I make love to Mulrain, Sedana,
5266900	5269900	underneath her horse, Coco.
5269900	5270900	It's pretty sensual.
5270900	5271900	Coochie coochie coochie.
5271900	5272900	Coochie coochie.
5272900	5273900	Ah.
5273900	5278900	Is that good or bad?
5287900	5295900	He jerks off at the end to finish himself.
5295900	5298900	As is commanded in the Quran.
5299900	5303900	I wipe the confetti off my stomach.
5303900	5308900	That's how good I am.
5308900	5311900	Just a little bit of confetti falls from the heavens.
5311900	5312900	Oh, no.
5312900	5313900	I thought it was coming out of the...
5313900	5314900	Oh.
5314900	5320900	Rip Taylor.
5320900	5326900	Sharpie, I know that your relationship with Quark is very close.
5326900	5328900	Will this interfere?
5328900	5331900	It doesn't matter.
5331900	5333900	He'll figure it out.
5333900	5334900	He'll adapt.
5334900	5339900	His relationship with me is, you know,
5339900	5344900	one that doesn't involve things going into each other.
5344900	5348900	I don't fully believe that, but I trust you.
5348900	5350900	So you stopped jerking off for three days
5350900	5353900	and you fuck Aaron and D&D?
5353900	5354900	Very romantic now.
5355900	5358900	This makes so much sense.
5358900	5362900	Under a horse.
5362900	5366900	While that same horse was watching.
5366900	5367900	Doesn't even make sense.
5367900	5368900	She's cool.
5368900	5370900	Because I have to assume that means it's their turn.
5370900	5372900	I mean, it's not like...
5372900	5375900	Well, Sharpie, let's mount Coco
5375900	5379900	and head to the Soul Explosion Yard.
5379900	5381900	What was it called?
5381900	5383900	The Soul Explosion Yard.
5383900	5388900	The Soul Explosion Yard was your belly just now.
5388900	5393900	Cut to me, Quark, and Christopher
5393900	5399900	just jerking off next to a tree.
5399900	5401900	Oh, boy.
5401900	5402900	Oh, God.
5402900	5404900	That was a good idea, Chris.
5404900	5405900	I'm not done yet.
5405900	5406900	Give me a second.
5406900	5407900	Okay, sorry.
5407900	5408900	Sorry.
5408900	5409900	I'm going to smoke one of my smoke sticks.
5409900	5410900	I got a new idea.
5410900	5411900	Oh, shit.
5411900	5412900	Lady in white.
5413900	5415900	Again, let's go to the Soul of Growth
5415900	5416900	if we're going to block the sun.
5416900	5418900	I know there's a temple.
5418900	5420900	Okay, we have to navigate through these traps.
5420900	5424900	Can I detect the trap?
5424900	5427900	What's the best way to navigate through these traps?
5427900	5429900	You can attempt to find a trap.
5429900	5431900	Once you see it, you can either avoid it
5431900	5433900	or dismantle it somehow.
5433900	5434900	Okay.
5434900	5436900	How many traps lay ahead of me?
5436900	5438900	Well, you don't know, so let's see how many.
5438900	5440900	Is there anything I have that would help?
5441900	5443900	You are also adept at finding traps,
5443900	5446900	so you could both sweep for traps.
5446900	5447900	Let's discover...
5447900	5449900	What is your class or race?
5449900	5450900	What are you?
5450900	5451900	He's a human world.
5451900	5453900	Singer-songwriter?
5454900	5455900	No, I know that, Christopher.
5455900	5456900	I know you're very...
5456900	5457900	Did you hear it?
5457900	5459900	Level one with a bullet.
5463900	5464900	Have you heard Lady in Red?
5464900	5466900	It was a huge song.
5467900	5469900	What are these?
5469900	5474900	Well, I'm a thief, a human thief with some, like...
5474900	5476900	You got some items.
5476900	5477900	Kind of like Batman.
5477900	5478900	All right.
5478900	5480900	Wait, so is he currently surrounded by trapsters?
5480900	5482900	Presumably, he knows how to get through these traps.
5482900	5484900	Presumably, he does.
5484900	5487900	Okay, I follow Christopher.
5490900	5492900	Yeah, I know where the traps are, right?
5492900	5493900	I've been here.
5493900	5494900	You've been here.
5494900	5497900	Christopher, again, all the food and gold you want,
5497900	5500900	let's get to the Soul of Growth if you can lead the way.
5500900	5502900	I have no use for gold.
5502900	5505900	I've got gold records and stuff.
5505900	5507900	How many gold records really do you have?
5507900	5508900	One.
5509900	5510900	It was this song.
5510900	5512900	I promise you, if we get to Soul of Growth,
5512900	5514900	a new gold record, maybe even platinum.
5514900	5515900	Okay, yeah.
5515900	5516900	All right, well, follow me.
5516900	5517900	Okay.
5517900	5520900	Lady in Red.
5520900	5526900	All right.
5526900	5528900	Are we through?
5528900	5531900	Okay, so do you guys want to join back up yet?
5531900	5532900	Yeah.
5532900	5533900	Sure.
5533900	5535900	Okay, we're going through the traps.
5535900	5538900	As you blaze your trails, a horse approaches.
5538900	5539900	Hey!
5539900	5540900	Hey!
5540900	5541900	Oh, my God.
5541900	5542900	Oh, my God.
5542900	5543900	Sharkbeam, all right.
5543900	5544900	Christopher!
5544900	5545900	Hey!
5545900	5546900	Hey!
5546900	5548900	He wrote Lady in Red.
5548900	5549900	He wrote Lady in Red.
5549900	5550900	Have you guys heard Lady in Red?
5550900	5551900	Yeah.
5551900	5552900	It was a big song.
5552900	5553900	I literally thought you were dead.
5553900	5554900	No, no, no.
5554900	5559900	No, I've just been lost for a while spiritually and also physically.
5559900	5560900	I'm all right.
5560900	5562900	You have some confetti in your hair.
5562900	5563900	Oh, ha ha.
5563900	5564900	Let me just...
5564900	5567900	I put it in a plastic bag and I put it in my pocket.
5567900	5569900	Tom Likas is right.
5569900	5570900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5570900	5571900	It was a Tom Likas.
5571900	5572900	It was a bad Tom Likas joke.
5572900	5573900	All right.
5573900	5574900	Sorry, everybody.
5574900	5578900	I know where the Soul of Growth is.
5578900	5579900	You know?
5579900	5580900	Yeah.
5580900	5584780	We're going to follow Christopher, famous singer-songwriter, through these traps, because
5584780	5585780	he knows the way.
5585780	5586780	I know the way.
5586780	5588180	And we're going to go to the Soul of Growth.
5588180	5589460	We're going to get whatever we want.
5589460	5590820	And also, I really...
5590820	5592180	He's giving me food and gold.
5592180	5595380	Food and gold, but I really want to get this guy's career back online.
5595380	5596380	Oh, that's great.
5596380	5603740	If you guys have any ideas for songs, you know, I'm like a sponge right now.
5603740	5606140	How about...
5606140	5608500	Cocoa and Brown.
5609500	5611500	I think you've got to get off the color thing.
5611500	5614500	I've been telling him this for like all day.
5614500	5618500	If you're good at detecting traps, then why can't you...
5618500	5623500	Look at the creative pitfalls, like all around you, you know?
5623500	5627500	And just get out of the area, you know, like sneak past all of it.
5627500	5628500	Or you're also...
5628500	5629500	Yeah, no, I'm going to.
5629500	5631500	I know how to do the traps I just go through.
5631500	5633500	There's an actual guy who wrote Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
5633500	5637500	We'll never know his name, but he probably wrote a bunch of shitty songs.
5638500	5639500	Jason Priestley.
5639500	5640500	But you're a thief, right?
5640500	5643500	Why don't we just like break into Tom Waits' house or something like that
5643500	5645500	and steal some song ideas?
5645500	5647500	I don't think my voice is...
5647500	5650500	I point my horse towards Tom Waits' house.
5650500	5652500	Your horse doesn't know.
5655500	5658500	So I feel like now that we've made a new friend, Krista Berg,
5658500	5659500	let's go to...
5659500	5661500	We're embarking towards the soul of growth.
5661500	5663500	I think that's a good cliffhanger, right?
5663500	5664500	Yeah, yeah, probably, yeah.
5664500	5666500	I mean, certainly chronologically we...
5666500	5669500	Yeah, I think we're running longer, but I think now Camille,
5669500	5670500	we've got you on board here now.
5670500	5672500	Yeah, you've got to come back next week now.
5672500	5677500	May I say quickly, in the back, we're selling these t-shirts
5677500	5678500	that Dan is wearing.
5678500	5681500	Wait, are we not in this world anymore?
5682500	5684500	This is Coco speaking.
5684500	5685500	Oh, t-shirts.
5687500	5688500	Pause from D&D World.
5688500	5690500	We have t-shirts in the back.
5690500	5693500	I don't know how many times we'll sell them again.
5693500	5694500	This might be the last time.
5694500	5697500	They're $15 or two for $25, otherwise they're online
5697500	5698500	and they're more expensive.
5698500	5700500	But yeah, come buy a t-shirt.
5700500	5701500	That's all.
5701500	5703500	They've got confetti on them.
5704500	5705500	From the tour.
5705500	5707500	Don't worry, by confetti, we mean DanceCon.
5707500	5708500	All right.
5708500	5710500	D&D Cliffhanger!
5710500	5711500	Thank you, Eric.
5714500	5716500	Thank you, Camille Nangiani.
5716500	5717500	Thank you, guys.
5718500	5720500	Thank you, Eric McGathey.
5721500	5722500	Thank you, Spencer.
5723500	5724500	You can...
5724500	5725500	Yeah.
5725500	5726500	That's exciting.
5726500	5728500	We have a new member of our party.
5728500	5729500	Yeah.
5729500	5731500	For the time being, anyway.
5731500	5732500	Chris DeBerg.
5735500	5738500	Finding out the octopus thing.
5739500	5741500	Jeff, it really turned into a good show.
5741500	5742500	It did.
5742500	5743500	Yeah.
5743500	5744500	Was there ever any doubt?
5744500	5745500	No, there was, yeah.
5745500	5747500	When I was talking, at the top of it,
5747500	5749500	about whether or not it was going to be a good show,
5749500	5750500	blah, blah, blah.
5750500	5751500	We can cut that out.
5751500	5752500	That's sinew, that's tissue.
5752500	5753500	I would say in the past,
5753500	5755500	the early days of nerd melt shows,
5755500	5758500	our best shows here when you were really driven by anxiety
5758500	5759500	and my fear that you were...
5759500	5760500	Yeah, sure.
5760500	5761500	Now that I've become a godlike being,
5761500	5763500	which we are going to embrace...
5764500	5765500	Don't tell me what to embrace.
5765500	5768500	I'm not going to affect the visage of a guy who's nervous
5768500	5772500	as someone who's become an impersonal cosmic force.
5772500	5775500	What I'm going to do is evolve into somebody who runs a real show
5775500	5778500	and has awesome guests and talks about interesting stuff.
5778500	5779500	Now, here's a good question.
5779500	5782500	Here's something I have not thought of until just now.
5782500	5784500	We on the tour kept ending with these songs,
5784500	5787500	these raps, these things that became kind of a...
5787500	5788500	You know, we did it.
5788500	5789500	We did it.
5789500	5790500	We did enough.
5790500	5795500	Now, how do you end a show now without that go-to thing?
5796500	5798500	Two words, Jeff.
5801500	5802500	Two words.
5806500	5808500	Do you want me to hit the music?
5808500	5809500	No, I thought that was it.
5809500	5812500	No, I don't know how to end the show.
5813500	5815500	God doesn't know how to end your day.
5816500	5817500	You go to bed.
5817500	5818500	That's what happens to you.
5818500	5819500	You close your eyes.
5819500	5823500	God keeps the universe fucking chugging.
5823500	5825500	We go to the drawing room and we have a drink.
5826500	5831500	You know, if I got to do a rap about being God,
5831500	5833500	we'll see how it goes.
5833500	5834500	All right.
5834500	5836500	I'm willing to roll those cosmic dice,
5837500	5838500	which style do you want?
5838500	5840500	We've got enough time to see how a rap goes.
5840500	5844500	Or... God damn it.
5844500	5846500	The rapping is so...
5847500	5848500	How about this?
5848500	5849500	For the last time.
5849500	5852500	This will be our last one because we have the cameras here
5852500	5855500	and we still have to use our non-licensed music.
5855500	5857500	Hopefully the last time we have to use that same music
5857500	5859500	we've been using just to keep it non-licensed.
5859500	5861500	We can go back to using Metallica riffs.
5861500	5862500	Yeah, absolutely.
5862500	5863500	Let's just give this one more roll.
5863500	5866500	And this will be maybe a little cherry on top of the entire tour.
5866500	5867500	Let's try this.
5867500	5868500	All right.
5868500	5870500	I don't tend to do well when I actually need to.
5870500	5871500	Oh, this.
5871500	5872500	Okay.
5872500	5875500	The rest was like hot August night to me.
5875500	5878500	Oh, it's so good to be back.
5879500	5883500	Good to be back here in Hollywood.
5883500	5885500	Octopuses.
5886500	5890500	My soul is flowing into yours.
5890500	5892500	What kind of beer do you like?
5892500	5894500	Coors.
5894500	5897500	If it's a different kind, it's okay.
5897500	5900500	In Harman Town.
5900500	5903500	I love all of you.
5903500	5907500	I love dudes and goo.
5907500	5910500	I love hats and shoes.
5910500	5914500	In Harman Town.
5914500	5918500	And I learned to love all the people.
5918500	5922500	Probably not going to rhyme anything with that but steeple.
5922500	5926500	Across the country of ours.
5926500	5929500	Cars.
5929500	5930500	Rhyming.
5930500	5931500	Don't rhyme.
5931500	5932500	Connect.
5932500	5933500	Connect with these people.
5933500	5934500	All right.
5934500	5935500	Look at the faces out here, Harman.
5935500	5936500	Look at the people that look.
5936500	5939500	Look somebody that you don't know in the eye.
5939500	5940500	Pick somebody at random.
5940500	5944500	And look that person in the eye and connect with this person.
5944500	5946500	But for real.
5947500	5949500	Don't rhyme car and far and steeple with people.
5949500	5950500	I won't.
5950500	5951500	I won't.
5951500	5952500	I won't.
5952500	5954500	Hello.
5954500	5955500	What's your name?
5955500	5956500	Martin.
5956500	5957500	Martin?
5957500	5961500	You look a little bit like Eric Wareheim.
5961500	5962500	Yeah.
5962500	5963500	You don't have to.
5963500	5966500	That was me getting in the way of us connecting.
5966500	5967500	Here's what you look like.
5967500	5970500	That's stupid.
5970500	5973500	Martin, I love you.
5973500	5975500	Martin, I love you.
5975500	5976500	We're the same person.
5976500	5979500	We were born the same.
5979500	5982500	We're only pretending to be separate.
5982500	5986500	I don't have to rhyme.
5986500	5989500	I could just stand here and talk.
5989500	5992500	Martin, you're a human being and so am I.
5992500	5993500	Martin.
5993500	5994500	Martin.
5994500	5995500	Martin.
5995500	5996500	Oh shit, sorry.
5996500	5997500	That was Martin.
5997500	6002500	I am an impersonal force who tries to come in and make you not connect with people to
6002500	6006500	prove that connection is more difficult than it appears.
6006500	6009500	Oh, I'm beating him.
6009500	6011500	I'm beating him.
6011500	6014500	Now I'm free to connect.
6014500	6017500	I'm free to connect.
6017500	6021500	I'm so free to connect with the world.
6021500	6023500	Because we're in Harman town.
6023500	6024500	What's your name?
6024500	6025500	Ben.
6025500	6026500	What's the problem?
6026500	6029500	I'm having a fight with my sister.
6029500	6031500	Is she older or younger?
6031500	6034500	Fuck her.
6034500	6036500	She should know that she has a little brother.
6036500	6039500	Her fucking job is to be kind of a junior parent.
6039500	6040500	Fuck her.
6040500	6041500	What's her name?
6041500	6042500	Sarah.
6042500	6043500	Sarah?
6043500	6044500	Fucking grow up.
6044500	6045500	You got a little brother.
6045500	6046500	It doesn't matter if he's 40.
6046500	6048500	He's your little brother.
6048500	6050500	Fucking Sarah.
6050500	6052500	Get your shit together.
6052500	6053500	What's your name?
6053500	6054500	Dan.
6054500	6055500	Dan?
6055500	6056500	Awesome.
6056500	6058500	What's the problem?
6058500	6059500	Work.
6060500	6061500	What do you do?
6061500	6063500	I teach high school.
6063500	6064500	Someone has to.
6064500	6066500	For God's sakes, our fucking country is collapsing.
6066500	6068500	Please, just hang in there.
6068500	6069500	Please.
6069500	6072500	God damn it, Dan.
6072500	6075500	It's insane that that's worthy of applause now.
6075500	6077500	That's how people actually feel.
6077500	6079500	Everyone is actually feeling that way.
6079500	6080500	Hang in there.
6080500	6081500	All right.
6081500	6082500	What's your name?
6082500	6083500	Hey, I know you.
6083500	6084500	You help with t-shirts.
6084500	6085500	Oh, yeah.
6085500	6086500	My name's Ryan.
6086500	6087500	Hey, Ryan.
6087500	6088500	Thanks for helping with t-shirts.
6088500	6090500	Thanks for letting me in your house.
6090500	6092500	He was in the documentary, kind of.
6092500	6094500	He helped everyone with t-shirts.
6094500	6096500	And then the documentary crew left,
6096500	6100500	and then you expressed a lot of gratitude
6100500	6102500	for being able to help Aaron with stuff,
6102500	6104500	and you get kind of emotional.
6104500	6106500	The documentary crew wasn't there to pick it up.
6106500	6112500	And the documentary crew is here.
6112500	6113500	I muster it up.
6113500	6114500	Do it.
6114500	6116500	Dance, monkey.
6116500	6119500	Tell us how much you love being in Harmontown.
6119500	6121500	I hope I can make friends with her someday.
6121500	6122500	I don't know.
6122500	6123500	Let's go to the drawing room afterwards.
6123500	6125500	I'll buy you a drink for help with t-shirts.
6125500	6127500	All right.
6127500	6129500	All right.
6129500	6131500	Who's having the best day of their life?
6131500	6132500	Who's...
6136500	6138500	What's your name?
6138500	6139500	David.
6139500	6141500	Is there anything good that happened about today,
6141500	6142500	detail-wise?
6142500	6144500	This is the second time I've ever actually
6144500	6146500	been here or seen the show, because my friends brought me,
6146500	6148500	because I'm having a great time.
6148500	6150500	Well, so the reason you're having a great time
6150500	6152500	is because you came to my show?
6152500	6153500	You are God.
6153500	6155500	I am God!
6158500	6161500	Harmontown!
6161500	6164500	I'm a God!
6164500	6167500	I make clouds and dogs!
6167500	6171500	I separated the sky from the earth!
6172500	6174500	You're here because of me,
6174500	6176500	and everything that you feel and do
6176500	6179500	is because a little guy like me
6179500	6182500	shot his cosmic goo into the universe
6182500	6185500	and fertilized a miff, and it's something!
6185500	6186500	My name is Harmon.
6186500	6187500	This is Harmontown!
6187500	6189500	Thank you for coming, everybody.
6189500	6191500	You're all gods!
6191500	6193500	You are all also gods.
6193500	6196500	Let's thank D.C. Pearson, Kameo Nanziani.
6201500	6206500	Whoa!
