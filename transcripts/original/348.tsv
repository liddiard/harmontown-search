0	27000	Hello gang, how's it going?
27000	32000	Thank you for coming.
32000	44000	My name is Comptroller Jeff Davis and Harman Town is now in session.
44000	69000	Chob Chob!
69000	70000	Hey hey!
70000	99000	My name is Fred Denton and the mayor of Harlan Town, Dan Harman.
99000	106000	Thanks folks!
106000	113000	Alright, we got a lot of show for you tonight, so let me get my thoughts out there.
113000	114000	Looking good Dan.
114000	117000	Thanks buddy, I wasn't fishing for that.
117000	123000	Is that a Hawaiian design on your shirt there?
123000	126000	That is a shirt from Tahiti.
126000	128000	Can I see your shirt?
128000	129000	Thank you.
129000	131000	Is that Tahiti on it?
131000	134000	Looks Hawaiian.
134000	140000	You guys see this documentary about Michelle Carter, the young lady who was famous a while
140000	148000	back, remember the big viral story, she encouraged the suicide of her boyfriend through text
148000	150000	messages, remember that?
150000	153000	No, gotta watch this documentary.
153000	157000	I think it's a mini series, maybe there's a couple parts and I can't remember where
157000	158000	the hell.
158000	161000	Sorry, just google it, there's gotta be one documentary and I'll just watch it.
161000	165000	Sorry, I should have got my facts straight, but I really recommend it, it's fucking incredible.
165000	172000	It's mind blowing to me how you receive the story and it's like how many more details
172000	173000	could you possibly get.
173000	178000	You felt at the time that you got the details and that's what's click-clickable about stuff
178000	180000	is always the gritty details.
180000	187000	The documentary kind of reveals that most things probably, if you get all the gritty
187000	193000	details, the grit becomes this homogenous paste and what you have is a big fucking pudding
193000	201000	of a couple crazy kids, neither of which really deserve, I personally got to the end of the
201000	207000	documentary feeling like if I was a judge I wouldn't charge her with anything.
207000	212000	If you haven't watched the documentary, I realize how insane that must sound which
212000	218000	is why you have to watch it because we all read the same headlines and news stories and
218000	230000	it's pretty crazy to see how directed your thoughts get by the total just impersonal
230000	235000	system of click following, like what's selling, what are people gonna click on and how underneath
235000	241000	it mythically it really does have to do with, there's a journalist in there who kind of
241000	249000	lays it down and goes like this has to do with teenage girls and our desire to believe
249000	259000	that they're crazy, stupid, psycho, spoiled and we click on that story over and over again.
259000	262000	We have these archetypes that we want to invest in.
262000	264000	I had to check out that documentary.
264000	267000	Only reason I wrote it down is because I was like check it out.
267000	272000	So they have this like title sequence, it's like one of those fancy HBO show, it's got
272000	278000	a title sequence that's like just kind of images but it's like am I getting older, am
278000	284000	I just finding more stuff in poor taste now, the title sequence is just a smoky interior
285000	287000	of a car.
287000	292000	It's just like smoke and like a gear shift and I'm like what, don't, what?
292000	296000	Because the guy killed himself with the carbon monoxide in his car.
296000	297000	Oh yeah.
297000	305000	And it's like, it's like, it's like, smoky car, yeah I get it, like Mickey Mouse in it,
305000	310000	you know, like creatively that's offensive before you even get into it psychologically.
311000	313000	Alright, okay, moving right along.
313000	318000	Did you know goats, we were at a wedding, they had goats at the wedding, or the wedding
318000	321000	was at a place that had goats, you know they got squared.
321000	323000	Wait, wait, which was it?
326000	330000	Well I'm not going to cast any aspersions because both families are from Georgia so
330000	332000	but no, it was a, they're good.
332000	336000	Were goats invited to the wedding or this is a wedding that was goat adjacent?
336000	338000	It was the husband's family.
338000	342000	It was at this, it was at this crazy kind of like greenhouse farm in Santa Barbara.
342000	348000	Yeah, it was this beautiful remote farm location, the actual service was right on this like
348000	352000	plain overlooking the beach like you see in like a Hollywood movie of a wedding and we're
352000	355000	like that doesn't happen in real life, it was nuts.
355000	356000	Did you see those goats?
356000	358000	Did you hear, were you there looking for goats?
358000	360000	Oh yeah, I'm well acquainted with goat pupils, continue.
360000	363000	Oh yeah, goat pupils are rectangular.
363000	364000	Yes they are.
364000	365000	They got 90 degree corners.
365000	366000	You didn't know this?
366000	367000	They look like panorama thumbnails.
367000	368000	You didn't know this?
368000	370000	No, because they have 330 degree vision.
370000	374000	We've been doing this podcast for seven years and we never, you still don't know that goat
374000	375000	rectangles.
375000	376000	You still don't know this?
376000	381000	It's so that goats can have 330 degree vision which at first you think.
381000	382000	That's hot.
382000	383000	You're a goat.
383000	386000	Who even cares what's in front of you?
386000	387000	Wait, were these goats just?
387000	388000	That's exactly the point.
388000	389000	Were these goats just intermittent?
389000	391000	Were they wandering about?
391000	392000	They're in a pen.
393000	398000	I hear that goats' legs on one side are shorter than the other.
398000	399000	Is that true?
399000	403000	But then you look around and you see all these other animals.
403000	404000	You see some chickens.
404000	406000	He evaded your question Rob.
406000	407000	You see how he evaded that?
407000	408000	And you see some cows.
408000	412000	Or I'm just finishing my bed, I might be just finishing my bed.
412000	417000	And you look around and you see some chickens and some cows and they all got these big
417000	421000	round eyes and the goats like, what did you have for breakfast?
421000	424000	Rectangular, yeah, that's why they need them.
424000	425000	330 degree vision.
425000	427000	When's the last time you ate a goat?
427000	428000	Brother?
428000	429000	Last week.
429000	432000	But you guys had some funny questions about it.
432000	438000	Rob alleges that half of goats' legs are shorter than the other half.
438000	443000	I think maybe there's a certain breed of goats, a certain subspecies or whatever.
443000	444000	Circle goats.
444000	450000	Unless that's a myth because they're born on the side of mountains.
451000	452000	Whoa.
452000	453000	I grew up with a goat.
453000	454000	We had a goat when I was a kid.
454000	456000	That's awesome.
456000	461000	And then one day our horse fell on the goat and knocked one of the horns out of the goat's
461000	462000	head.
462000	463000	Have I told this story before?
463000	464000	No.
464000	465000	What happened?
465000	466000	The goat just told you.
466000	467000	Shut up.
467000	468000	The goat.
468000	469000	I'm busy.
469000	476000	The goat had one of his horns, I believe it was his left horn, completely, Steve Levy
476000	479000	on the ice machine.
480000	486000	The horn was knocked clear out of its head and then maggots would get into it because
486000	488000	now there was a clean path into its brain.
488000	489000	Sure.
489000	490000	We've talked about this before.
490000	491000	How could there not be?
491000	492000	Clear path into its brain.
492000	493000	Yeah.
493000	497000	And then I would have to trade off with my brother for the shittiest chore of all time
497000	503000	was go out with a spray can of iodine and a spoon.
503000	504000	Sure.
504000	505000	A metal spoon.
505000	506000	Like a big...
506000	508000	You ever scoop out any brains?
508000	513280	No, because I didn't have to get that far in there, but I had to go and spray yellow
513280	519400	awful iodine and like headlock a goat and spray iodine into it, which the goat, guess
519400	520400	what?
520400	521400	Didn't like that?
521400	522400	Sure.
522400	523400	Sounds painful.
523400	525520	And then I would take the spoon and scrape out the maggots and throw them out and it
525520	528200	would make a kind of a scrapey bone sound because...
528200	529200	A bony scrapey.
529200	534720	We had to do that until the horns started regrowing and I didn't have to scrape maggots
534720	535720	out of a goat face.
535720	537880	Well, you didn't finish your story.
537880	538880	Huh?
538880	539880	You didn't finish the story.
539880	542520	Oh, so long story short, I'm fucking it.
542520	546840	And I mean, fucking it.
546840	547840	Fucking the brain hole.
547840	551760	So the end of your bit was chickens and cows have round eyes.
551760	552760	No, the end of the bit.
552760	556280	And you were upset that we didn't know you were doing a bit.
556280	560080	The end of the bit where he says, what did you have for breakfast?
560080	561080	Upset?
561080	562080	Yeah.
562080	563080	Bored?
563080	564080	Yeah.
564280	568960	Like, like, like over it, you know, just like, yeah, I'll finish talking about this.
568960	569960	What'd you have for breakfast?
569960	570960	What'd you have for breakfast?
570960	571960	That was the goat.
571960	572960	You know what?
572960	573960	That's a metaphor for that goat.
573960	574960	Life.
574960	575960	The rust belt.
575960	576960	What?
576960	577960	Oh, okay.
577960	578960	Lost its horn.
578960	579960	You know?
579960	580960	Clear path to its brain.
580960	581960	Okay.
581960	582960	Through that wound.
582960	583960	Maggots set in.
583960	585960	Wizard of Oz kind of shit.
585960	586960	Yeah.
586960	587960	Yeah.
587960	588960	I was just to finish.
588960	591640	I was getting to the goat thanked Jeff.
591640	592840	He said, thank you.
592840	593840	You know?
594600	595600	Like Jeff stories.
595600	596600	Oh, the goat thanked me.
596600	597600	Oh, the goat thanked me.
597600	598600	Thank you.
598600	599600	Do you think that, okay.
599600	604280	So I was thinking about my dogs today while I was in the pool and I was, I was, I suddenly
604280	609440	thought like, you know, cause we, we put all this to do about like, oh, mankind shaped
609440	614240	dogs like development, you know, and like, but then I started to think like, cause it
614240	618360	was like, I've always used the example of like, well, you know, there's a, it's like
618480	624440	what we're not saying about that shaping is that the dogs that didn't behave or look the
624440	627720	way we liked, you know, they ended up thrown on the campfire and I was like, like, that's
627720	631960	how you like shape an animal that fast and it's just like awful eugenics.
631960	636360	But then, and I was thinking today, I was like, you know, these dogs, like I, cause
636360	639600	I was watching Harvey's tail and I'm like, he's in a new house and it's like, there's
639600	643880	a, I, I've, I've, I've, I've read online about the vocabulary of their tails.
643880	645640	You know, there's a whole language to their tails.
645640	651520	Like it's certain altitudes and angles and then like amounts of rhythms of wagging
651520	652280	and all this stuff.
652680	657200	And, um, I, I, I, I was like, you know, but there was nothing that I read in the
657200	660360	article about dog's tails that actually surprised me.
660840	664320	And then it made me, I was like, well, yeah, that's kind of an, I already knew
664320	668120	that I already, I didn't see it written in print, but I knew that the higher the
668120	671200	tail of this and the slower the tail that and blah, blah, blah.
671480	675360	And then I was thinking today, I'm like, he's not, so I have an inborn sense in
675400	683440	me as a homo sapien of like dog tail recognizing just as much as dogs are being
683440	688640	born that have this sort of innate sense of like, they look at the more expressive
688640	689520	side of our face.
689520	693320	They, they don't know they're being born with this, like these predisposed bread
693320	697960	into their gene pool, like, uh, uh, uh, couplings with human behavior.
698120	701680	And I'm starting to think like, well, geez, well, we're human, you know, don't
701680	707600	you think that there's a certain amount to which like only the humans that
707640	713240	understood dogs well enough survived to reproduce with other humans?
714480	721280	Yeah, after, after a certain point, like if you're just not a dog person, by the
721280	725640	way, how many not a dog people are here, homo sapiens, not a lot.
725640	729760	I mean, some of you don't have dogs, but a lot of people hate cats.
729760	734240	I don't get them, but, uh, like, like, like, like how many people are just like,
734240	737160	I'm not a dog, dog person, like maybe not a dog owner.
737160	737920	Cause you're scared.
737920	741920	You don't want to like, you know, engage in this freaky relationship.
741920	742480	I get that.
742480	747640	I get that humans love of dogs that, that, that is a, we've been, we've been bred
747640	749800	out dog haters have are gone.
749840	751240	They don't, they don't get laid.
752800	754520	They might even get mauled to death.
754520	756920	We don't know what dead men tell no tales.
756920	761000	Are there any dog, does anybody here like, and be honest and don't just, you
761000	764240	know, like lie about it, but like, does anybody try to be a hero by saying you
764240	767680	hate dogs, does anybody here actually have an aversion to dogs?
767960	768960	Aversion is different.
768960	771200	If I can say though, there's a lot of people with allergies.
771200	775480	There's people who could be scared of dogs, but there was no applause for that.
775480	778600	I mean, I'm just, yeah, like, like it really is cliche, but then a whole man's
778600	781560	best friend thing, it's like, geez, there's a two way street happening.
781560	785280	I just thought today, I was like, holy cow, man, who's walking who?
785280	788320	You know, I mean, I'm sure we've had a tremendous impact, but like, like, like
788320	794800	we, I bet there's a whole like, like, like splinter of humans that don't
794800	798240	exist because they couldn't read the tail.
798240	798600	Right.
798640	799480	You know what I mean?
800520	802600	What does the high tail mean versus the low tail?
802640	804240	Well, the high tail is just general.
804240	805600	Like, I mean, what do you think it means?
805600	806960	What do you feel it means in your heart?
806960	810440	If a dog's got its tail, like way up in the air, excitement.
810480	810880	Yeah.
810880	814120	I mean, like, well, and, and, and positive excitement, right?
814120	818920	Like, not just what if, what if it seems like a click bait to me, like the
818920	824040	article will want to know what your dog's feeling based on tail.
824080	827160	When it's wagging fast, it's happy.
827840	830240	What do you think is wagging slowly?
830320	831480	It's less happy.
831480	831920	What do you think?
831920	833840	What about a dog on its tail is straight?
833960	838120	Like, like, like if it's a sticking straight out, like a board, right?
838360	843200	Like, like total, like a squirrel is in its area when it's down.
843280	844160	We all know what that means.
844160	845680	We use that expression for ourselves.
845680	846200	On wheat.
847360	849920	And then there's a whole language to their barks too, which we also
849920	854600	instinctively understand you test humans, including human non-dog owners.
854920	859040	Um, and they all have an innate understanding of which types of barks
859040	861000	mean there's a person at the door.
861000	862760	Someone's trying to break into my car.
862880	865480	Um, they saw an animal like humans.
865520	869160	Do a bark for me and I'm going to, I'm going to give you my, I'm going to
869160	871440	give you my honest, like, like, like Rorschach tests.
871440	871840	Right.
871840	874320	Like, like, like you, you give me, can I, can I help?
874920	875360	Yeah.
875440	875680	Yeah.
875680	876480	I'm going to help you.
876560	878920	Well, we're doing the barks or, or, or reading the barks.
878960	879680	Are you barking?
879720	883040	No, I'm going to, I'm going to reveal some things I've learned about dog barking
883040	885360	by trying to, I'm going to do, I'm going to do a dog bark.
885600	886120	He'll do it.
886120	887040	And then we'll talk it over.
887120	887480	Yeah.
887520	888320	You do it bark.
888320	891320	And then shrub and I and Spencer, we're going to, we're going to analyze.
891560	891840	Okay.
891840	894480	But don't look at my face because I'll give it away because I'm human.
894480	897800	So I'll like, like, okay, so here's dog bark.
897800	898240	Number one.
898240	899240	You tell me what this means.
899240	899600	Okay.
899760	903320	And then this is, this is based on an actual bark that you are familiar with.
903320	904080	I'm not looking at you.
904080	904400	Yeah.
904400	908800	And also I heard a thing on a podcast of two that breaks down, like what the
908800	911480	vocabulary of dog barks, like, what's the podcast?
912080	912880	I can't remember.
912920	913600	I don't know.
913800	914320	It doesn't matter.
915120	915880	They didn't do any work.
915880	916920	They don't deserve any credit.
918840	919320	Okay.
919600	922440	Uh, I, I, I, I, I'm not looking at you.
922440	922920	Number one.
922920	924320	And tell me, tell me, tell me what this means.
924320	924680	Okay.
924800	928160	Professor shrub and I are going to go into evaluate your bark.
928400	928760	Okay.
928800	930560	I got so much lint on my leg.
931680	932560	Stay focused shrub.
932640	932880	Okay.
932880	933120	Sorry.
933120	933720	Stay focused.
943360	943800	Okay.
943920	944360	I got it.
944440	945520	I got, I got, I think I got this one.
945520	945880	Spencer.
945880	946400	What do you think?
946560	947840	That means everything.
951080	951600	Right.
951640	952240	What you got round?
952280	952960	I said, get up.
953000	954640	It means get, get out of here.
954640	955440	Go, go.
955480	957640	I think that it's a stranger danger.
957760	958000	Yeah.
958320	958640	Yeah.
959280	959560	Yeah.
959760	960160	Okay.
960560	962360	So here's, here's the answer.
962400	962880	So, okay.
962880	964760	Let me try one more and then we'll bring our guests out.
965040	965640	One more.
965680	967320	No, we're going to do fucking 30 of these.
967320	970120	Well, well, we'll do, we'll, we'll, we'll do it with her.
971560	972720	She's a, she's a veterinarian.
972720	973240	You're going to love her.
973600	977120	Um, the, uh, here's, here's a, here's another, uh, type.
977120	979920	So tell me what you think this part, can I, can I look at you this time?
979960	984360	No, well, no, I'd rather you didn't because I'm going to express with my face.
984360	985520	Like, or I'm going to have tells.
986040	986440	Okay.
986560	987040	Here we go.
989360	989560	Yeah.
998040	998840	Do it one more time.
1005680	1006000	Give it to me.
1006000	1006560	Can I have the bar?
1006560	1007560	No, no, no, I'm not joking.
1007600	1008200	Give it to me.
1010200	1010960	I think I can do better.
1010960	1013240	So can I have the bar?
1013240	1014960	Can I hear it in my head?
1015120	1015440	Here we go.
1015480	1018560	It's kind of like the first time you try to do Donald Trump, you know, you just
1018560	1019600	ended up doing Seth Meyers.
1019720	1020000	Okay.
1020040	1020800	Um, all right.
1021400	1021640	All right.
1032080	1032880	Paint the space.
1032920	1033240	Yeah.
1033280	1034440	You don't look at my face.
1034440	1036680	I will never.
1040520	1040920	Okay.
1040920	1041600	Just come on.
1043360	1045040	That means war is hell, man.
1045040	1045960	They got Johnny.
1045960	1050240	I think that means stay away from my food.
1050320	1051000	Yes.
1051880	1053320	To, to, to whom, to whom?
1053720	1054320	Another dog.
1054320	1055000	Yes.
1056920	1058000	Now, how does he know that?
1058760	1061680	What I learned in the podcast is the vocabulary of dogs.
1061680	1065480	It's about sharpness of the bark versus like gravel.
1065760	1069960	So it's like, and it's about, so they're, they're, um, uh, the, the more, the
1069960	1073840	sharper, uh, with the barks with more fidelity, like if you looked at them
1073840	1077440	on an oscilloscope, the ones with a definite shape to them out of this
1077440	1082280	punctuated sharp, sharp, they're, they're, they're announcing something.
1082320	1088480	But if there's like more gravel, of course, can I give you a scenario and
1088480	1089440	then you could do a bark.
1090360	1090720	Okay.
1090720	1091040	Okay.
1091080	1091400	Okay.
1091960	1095440	My question is, because we have, we have, there's a stranger at the door.
1095480	1096240	That's that break.
1096280	1098280	Well, can I do, wait, can I just do third one?
1098360	1099920	I want to do a third one.
1099920	1100520	Cover your eyes.
1100520	1101040	Cover your eyes.
1101480	1103520	Don't look at me.
1103520	1105000	Cause if you look at me, you'll know what it is.
1105040	1106720	And we'll go back to what I wanted.
1106720	1107120	Okay.
1107760	1108280	All right.
1110280	1110680	Okay.
1112120	1113120	It was a good idea.
1114880	1115280	Okay.
1115320	1115880	Here it goes.
1115880	1116320	Here it goes.
1116400	1117000	I'm not looking.
1129920	1130560	What do you guys think?
1130960	1132720	I would say take, try that one more time.
1132760	1132960	Okay.
1132960	1133160	Okay.
1140640	1141080	All right.
1142600	1146600	I think that's a dog that is sleepy and has taken mesculum.
1148200	1148520	I'll see.
1148520	1148960	It's a good thing.
1148960	1149600	You didn't look at me.
1149600	1155280	See, I think, I think that's like a dog, like, like wanting to kind of play or
1155280	1160320	whatever kind of, you know, kind of going, ah, there's a dog asking if they
1160320	1164520	had gluten free rolls and then realizing, you know what?
1164520	1165880	It's about the carbs with me.
1167080	1169840	I can't pretend it's healthy just because of some fucking gluten
1169840	1171040	word I learned yesterday.
1171240	1172000	I'm out of here.
1172000	1172880	I want to lose weight.
1173960	1174600	Our next guest.
1174960	1175280	Oh yeah.
1177520	1178080	What was your bet?
1178160	1179800	I was going to say, I was not a bit.
1179920	1183640	Why don't we, why don't we bring out the guests and have her be a part of the, of
1183640	1185480	this, well, that could be fun.
1186600	1188160	Absolutely steamroll.
1188160	1190520	This important inquiry that we're doing right now.
1190720	1191160	Okay.
1191280	1193520	Our next guest has already been a guest very recently too.
1193520	1195040	I just like her and we thought we'd have her back.
1195040	1196520	Let's have Heather and Campbell come out.
1215200	1216480	Hello, Heather and Campbell.
1216480	1217000	Hey, sorry.
1218000	1220440	Heather and Campbell, one of my favorite improvisers and favorite
1220440	1221640	peoples in the universe.
1221680	1222160	Hello.
1222200	1222840	It's good to see you.
1222880	1223280	Hi, Jeff.
1223480	1227560	You look like the, like the, like the dark night version of a, like a Mario
1227560	1228000	brother.
1229040	1230720	Ah, I'll take it.
1230720	1231280	I'll take it.
1232000	1234200	We're kind of in the same outfit.
1234240	1236360	Totally unplanned.
1236400	1236720	Yeah.
1237520	1239680	You both have a like coveralls on.
1239720	1240040	Yeah.
1240080	1241440	We're going to add a hat and a hat.
1241480	1243240	We're starting a car wash.
1244880	1246640	Rob got steamrolled before you came out.
1246640	1249040	What, what did you, what were you going to, what was your dog request?
1249080	1252720	I was going to give you a scenario and I wanted to hear what the dog.
1252760	1253920	Heather, are you a dog owner?
1253920	1254200	A dog?
1254200	1255360	Jesus Christ.
1257720	1260120	Five times in a row with this shit.
1261240	1263480	Heather, are you a dog aficionado?
1263520	1265160	Are you a dog lover?
1265400	1266240	Dog like her?
1266920	1267560	Do you have a dog?
1267600	1268640	I'm not doing it now.
1268680	1269320	No, you're using it.
1269360	1269920	No, I'm not.
1269920	1270800	I'm putting it on hold.
1271160	1272680	I know you're in charge.
1272680	1274480	I want to bring our guest into the fold here.
1274880	1277800	No, I feel like I feel like he had something you needed to say.
1277800	1282040	So if you, if you have something I'll, I can take, we can take a moment and I'll
1282040	1283200	answer or we can come back to them.
1283200	1286080	I only ask, are you a dog person?
1286160	1287840	Is this okay if I answer this?
1288480	1288920	Yes.
1288960	1289560	Okay, great.
1290600	1292480	So I do, I'm taking, yes.
1292520	1294920	I co-own a dog with my girlfriend.
1295000	1295400	Okay.
1295640	1298800	It's primarily her dog, but now it is also my dog.
1298800	1299280	Fantastic.
1299280	1303520	So you're qualified to weigh in on this dog inquiry that we are engaging upon.
1303840	1304560	What kind of dog?
1304640	1309440	It is a, it is a Maltese and it's completely wall-eyed and it just came.
1309560	1311840	Uh, we just found out it as Cushing's disease.
1311880	1312280	What?
1313400	1313880	What does it mean?
1313880	1314840	Is that's where it plays.
1314840	1316440	Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars.
1323040	1324520	This did not deserve that mug.
1325960	1332240	If you want to see an unearned mug, $5 a month, $5 a month, while it lasts.
1332240	1333480	I'll supply it's last.
1336480	1338120	What is Cushing's disease?
1338120	1338720	It's not serious.
1338720	1339440	I hope it's adorable.
1339440	1342680	Well, it, no, uh, it thinks hot dogs are socks.
1342680	1344160	Come on Cushing.
1344200	1350080	That would be, it would be, it's not a, uh, it, um, it has a tumor on either it's,
1350120	1354520	it's, uh, it's pituitary or adrenal glands, which, uh, release a bunch of
1354520	1357680	cortisol into its blood, uh, which is the stress hormone.
1357680	1360760	So the dog is totally stressed out all the time.
1361720	1362880	It's just sad.
1365880	1367360	And yet you find it delightful.
1368440	1374600	If you knew how dumb the dog looked, uh, but, uh, there it's on medicine and
1374600	1376600	hopefully it's true, it's totally treatable.
1376600	1380640	It's just not the most ideal way for a dog to live, but it's going to be okay.
1381600	1384120	Is that a disease that exists in humans or just in dogs?
1384160	1386440	I, I, I don't know.
1386920	1387560	I don't know.
1387680	1388680	I'm not a yes.
1388680	1389240	Yes.
1389360	1392280	Cushing's disease affects human beings and dogs.
1392320	1394120	It is transferable from one to the other.
1396240	1396560	Okay.
1396600	1397080	Great.
1397200	1397760	I got a woo.
1397760	1398760	So that's correct.
1400240	1400680	All right.
1400960	1402000	So, so, all right.
1402000	1403800	Shrob, what was your thing going to be?
1404600	1405200	Totally.
1405240	1405640	Okay.
1405640	1408280	So I was just going to say, you're working on anything, Heather.
1412480	1413880	Yeah, I got one.
1419520	1423320	This is what you're like to other people.
1426440	1426960	It's true.
1427600	1428280	Very true.
1429600	1430200	Very true.
1434200	1436640	I was going to say, like, I want to give you a scenario.
1436640	1439000	I want to hear what the dog bark would sound like.
1439040	1439480	Okay.
1440080	1442520	And do we need to close our eyes while you do this or no?
1442920	1443920	No, no, we're just going to hear you.
1444520	1445400	Well, you're going to know.
1445440	1445640	Yeah.
1445640	1446160	We're going to know.
1446160	1447000	Cause you say, we're going to know.
1447040	1447760	Yeah, exactly.
1447760	1449000	So, okay.
1449080	1455040	Um, pay attention to me, to the owner, like pay attention, like pay attention.
1455720	1457200	Do you want to hear what that bark sounds like?
1457760	1458080	Yeah.
1458720	1460840	Oh, pay attention to me saying, pay attention to me.
1460880	1461120	Yeah.
1461120	1465880	You're the dog and I'm like, I'm like on my phone or I'm reading a book.
1465880	1478720	So get, get, try to really get my attention.
1478760	1479120	Okay.
1479160	1479400	Okay.
1479400	1479880	For real.
1480320	1480560	Right.
1495240	1495600	No.
1496040	1496320	Okay.
1503240	1503760	Stop it.
1506400	1507680	Well, I nailed it.
1507680	1511520	I just wanted that to go on for an hour.
1511840	1512000	Yeah.
1513840	1521280	Uh, I, uh, I'm going to, I, you're the dog and you're trying to express to Rob,
1521280	1528640	your owner or Heather, uh, that you haven't been walked in a while and it's,
1528640	1531080	and it's time to go romp and play.
1543800	1544200	I'll do it.
1544200	1544880	Harvey does.
1545640	1553880	He does these like Chewbacca, like utterances that are like human.
1553960	1555760	It's like he's trying to talk like a person.
1556840	1558160	Heather, what's your dog's name?
1558440	1560120	Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn.
1560360	1568320	My dog, Lolly sneezes when she wants to be paid attention to.
1568320	1570960	Like if I'm in bed too long in the morning, she'll go.
1575880	1578640	Does, does Brooklyn do anything like that?
1579880	1581360	Brooklyn's too stressed out, man.
1582080	1582440	Yeah.
1582440	1583440	I'm curious what is.
1584080	1588680	Brooklyn is like for the last few months while she's been coming down with this
1588680	1591360	has been perpetually laid out in the middle of the room.
1591840	1594520	Arms flat, like belly flat on the ground.
1594560	1595720	Arms spread out.
1595720	1597680	Like the world is moving too quickly.
1600280	1601160	Like a bear rug.
1601360	1601680	Yeah.
1601720	1602440	Like a bear rug.
1602440	1602640	Yeah.
1602840	1610120	Um, but, uh, yeah, I, I think I read that, uh, sneezing in a dog means I'm not a
1610120	1614280	threat, like they'll sneeze when they play with each other to remind each other
1614280	1615200	that they're not a threat.
1615280	1618960	I think I thought there was, I thought my house was dirty.
1619040	1623280	I like, I like, I like, they're constantly, you know, like, like, like with, yeah.
1623280	1624640	And they do it together.
1624640	1624960	They do.
1624960	1627600	I'm like, Jesus Christ, what's wrong with my house?
1628000	1629040	Well, they do it to each other.
1629240	1632040	Well, yeah, they kind of like both, like, like, especially if they've been
1632080	1637280	laying around all day and then they kind of like start getting up and getting
1637320	1642120	frisky and then it's like, like they start sneezing all over the place.
1642160	1643920	I think that means I'm not a threat.
1643960	1644600	We're playing.
1644720	1647240	I think I read that somewhere.
1647680	1650960	What does it mean that Nigel just fucks the hell out of Harvey?
1651080	1653640	Like, I think I know.
1653680	1658400	I think it's just like anxiety, but like, like, like, like, cause he, Nigel
1658400	1660320	can't win a game of fetch with Harvey.
1660320	1661680	So he's just learned now.
1661680	1662280	That's what I do.
1662280	1665200	That if he lets Harvey get the ball, Harvey will eventually get so tired.
1665200	1668880	He has to lay down and like chew his ball and try to keep someone from taking it.
1668880	1673040	And then Nigel's just like, it's like climbs up behind him and just rails him
1673040	1675960	for until what, until nothing.
1675960	1676960	He's a fixed dog.
1676960	1681040	Like I know it's can't be anything but pure, just like comfort for him.
1681040	1684280	What does Harvey's like, what is the look on Harvey's face?
1684520	1688840	Harvey just acts like either Harvey acts like he paid for it.
1688960	1694840	Like, like, like he's like, yeah, but, but like not like, Oh yeah.
1694840	1698440	But I can't tell if Harvey's ignoring it, if he's conscious of it.
1698440	1703760	Cause her, Nigel's not really getting anywhere near his actual opening.
1703760	1706320	I mean, Harvey's the size of a skyscraper compared to him.
1706320	1708280	So he's just like rubbing his little.
1708320	1711000	Harvey never has a very complicated look in his eyes.
1711000	1713160	He's a pretty simple fellow.
1713160	1717200	But Nigel, just like his legs are so much shorter.
1717840	1723080	It's just like he just lays his front legs on Harvey.
1723080	1725880	Like, like they just, they don't touch the ground.
1725880	1730320	He just like, like gets on his back and he puts both paws on either side of him
1730480	1733800	and lays his chin down across Harvey's back and just go.
1735840	1738040	For $5 a month, you can see.
1740840	1742560	But I don't know if I'm supposed to stop them.
1742560	1743560	Do you know anything about this?
1743560	1744640	I'm not asking because you're gay.
1744640	1745640	I don't.
1747440	1748760	I'm asking because you're a dog owner.
1750280	1750720	Yeah.
1750720	1752560	Well, I mean, okay.
1752560	1753480	You're not supposed to stop.
1753480	1754720	It's like sleepwalking.
1755600	1758760	Is there any, like, like this, I can't stop them.
1759520	1762360	I think humans have a hair trigger for this domination talk.
1762360	1764840	When we think about dogs and how they're interacting with each other.
1764840	1770280	Like what I've learned from modern dog books is that we, we, we go to that
1770280	1773360	word too much for it to explain their behavior.
1773480	1776760	My dog fucks where the food comes out of.
1777640	1783480	Like it, it has a, it has a toy that delivers treats and after the
1783480	1787120	treats have come out of the toy, it fucks the toy.
1788400	1790200	So I don't know that it's dominance.
1790200	1791360	I think it's, I think it's,
1793440	1798600	I think, I think you're right because Lolly has, we got, we got her a big stuffed
1798600	1803800	animal actually was Kate stuffed animal became Lolly's after we came home and
1804320	1806960	caught her fucking the hell out of it.
1807560	1808480	And she was just like,
1811000	1812960	I was like, well, okay, well now it's yours.
1813640	1817480	I'm not going to hang out with that anymore, but, but she'll like grab it and
1817480	1821200	toss it around and flip it in the air and just like roll around on it.
1821240	1825080	And then finished with a good old bone.
1825120	1825320	Yeah.
1825320	1825800	Same.
1826080	1826440	Yeah.
1826480	1828200	And my dog is a female dog.
1828200	1830040	So I don't think it's just fun.
1830080	1830560	Yeah.
1830800	1834520	I think, I think if you want, what I've learned is that when it's doing, when
1834520	1839880	she's fucking her toy, if I say good girl, she'll look at me and stop.
1841800	1844200	Like I, because of the scrutiny, that's a normal reaction.
1844200	1844400	Yeah.
1844440	1849280	Well, I think I think she comes too.
1849560	1851040	And it's like, what am I doing?
1852080	1852560	Yeah.
1853040	1853920	What am I being told?
1853920	1858360	I'm good at, I mean, she's good at sucking where the food comes out.
1859080	1860880	I wonder if it feels good at all.
1860880	1863960	And if it does, if that's not incredibly frustrating because it
1863960	1866720	can't achieve the culmination.
1866760	1868480	Do female dogs do like hump?
1868480	1869880	Like, like, like they actually do that.
1869920	1870360	Yeah.
1870480	1870720	Yeah.
1870720	1870920	Yeah.
1871080	1871440	Okay.
1871440	1876040	So here's, here's, here's something that, that Lolly does after she takes a shit.
1876200	1882400	So she'll take a shit and then she'll like kick grass and dirt up and
1882400	1886080	miss and all over the place, like not even touching the shit.
1886080	1887320	She'll kick it on my face.
1887320	1889560	She'll kick it on my arms, kick it on the house, whatever.
1889560	1890520	It's all over the place.
1890760	1891360	Misses it.
1891400	1895600	Now I know she's trying what she's probably trying to do, trying to cover up
1895600	1900640	the shit so no other animals come around and go, Oh, there's shit here.
1900720	1902720	I'm going to have a little dog to eat later.
1902720	1903600	That's what I'm thinking.
1903640	1904400	That's what I'm thinking.
1905200	1908000	That's what, but it's like hardwired into her brain.
1908000	1912800	I mean, I, I bet you're right, but boy, what a, what an innocent time that must
1912800	1917760	have been in the biosphere where you could just window shop for feces.
1919040	1921080	Smells like a rabbit's been around here.
1921080	1924800	I think I'll just set up camp and wait for it to come back, take another shit.
1924800	1927960	Well, they probably do because they go, Oh, a rabbit eats a lot of grass.
1927960	1930000	So it's like, Oh, I'm going to go after that thing.
1930000	1935840	And if you smell like, I know, but cut to the blade runner landscape of flaming
1935840	1939840	smoke stacks, but the animals are still doing the same things, but it's like,
1940080	1941240	Oh, better bury that shit.
1941360	1945920	Lest a fucking Jackalope, uh, prey on me by smelling.
1945920	1947840	And it's like, you ain't got nothing to worry about.
1948080	1949680	Here's another thing flies.
1949800	1951440	Why do flies fly away?
1951640	1957120	When you go there on the shit, you walk up to the turd and the flies go, run.
1958160	1959280	You're fine.
1964760	1967440	Why do flies fly away?
1968440	1973680	There's a big turd walking by like, I wasn't going to do anything.
1973680	1974680	You're fine.
1974880	1976400	I'm not going to take it away.
1978000	1980440	I'm not going to swat you, but here's the thing.
1980440	1982520	Here's, here's my question to the room.
1982560	1988440	So, so my dog is really bad at covering up her own shit.
1988480	1990360	I don't think she knows why she does it.
1990360	1992200	She just knows I'm taking a shit.
1992400	1993520	I got to do this thing.
1993520	1994160	It's in my hand.
1994400	1996240	So she's doing it wrong.
1996720	2000440	And, and I wish I could say, Hey, you miss, you're missing it.
2000440	2002760	Just, if you're going to do it, do it right or whatever.
2002920	2009280	But my question is, what are we as human beings doing naturally, but completely
2009280	2013840	wrong, you know, like if like the next evolutionary stage looked down and went,
2013840	2019560	Oh geez, why are you, you, you're obviously doing that to do this, but you're
2019560	2022200	doing it so well, I'll tell you my, my vote.
2022240	2022800	Here we go.
2022800	2023440	Lying.
2023600	2025120	I think, I think we're going to look back.
2025120	2030040	Well, maybe now we, but like the next stage of our evolution, we're going to
2030040	2033120	be like, holy shit, people just kept lying.
2033200	2034520	It was like insane.
2034520	2035680	It was killing them.
2035720	2038120	They lied so much and there was nothing to hide.
2038560	2039520	What the hell were that?
2039520	2041680	And then it'll be like, well, you don't understand at the time.
2041680	2044360	It was like, if you told the truth about this, then you could get a lot of trouble.
2044360	2046720	It's like, yeah, but not if everyone told the truth and they're going to
2046720	2048800	be like really snobby about it.
2049160	2051800	They're going to be like, all you gotta do is just be honest, but they, they
2051840	2054880	won't have a choice because they'll have USB drives for brains that
2054880	2055880	everyone could just look at.
2056360	2060960	But, um, and that, but they're going to be really happy and like incredibly horny.
2067120	2070680	Cause you want to have to go to a bar to find out who's into tentacle porn.
2075800	2077560	Hey, oh, one more animal fact.
2080440	2081320	Octopuses.
2081360	2085480	Do you guys know, do you guys know, um, uh, that cows, uh, do you
2085480	2086920	know why cows have hooves?
2088920	2090040	Why do they?
2092120	2093080	They lack toes.
2105120	2107840	Do you know, do you know what, um, do you know what a female
2107840	2109800	Buffalo says to, uh,
2110440	2111120	here we go.
2113240	2113440	I don't know.
2113440	2114160	Why is she female?
2114280	2118120	Do you know what a mommy Buffalo says to her son when she drops him off at school?
2118160	2118720	You fuck her.
2118760	2123080	Ah, I, but you, you, you said female Buffalo.
2123120	2125560	I was like bicep, but I didn't want to say it that early.
2125560	2127160	Cause that wouldn't be as impressive.
2127200	2128320	What say it again?
2128920	2131600	What does it, what does it mommy Buffalo say to her son?
2131600	2140600	You know, why Heather Ann's back?
2140640	2141920	Why she texted me today.
2142040	2143000	Campbell.
2144200	2147160	Oh, sorry.
2147160	2148400	I, I, I treat you.
2151040	2158480	Do you know why Heather Ann Campbell, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, she texted me today.
2158560	2160160	Hey, I heard you like Hudson Hawk.
2160880	2164520	And there's only one kind of person that texts that Hudson Hawk fan.
2165120	2168640	And I've only ever met one of them through text today.
2168720	2170120	I like, I liked Hudson Hawk.
2170200	2170600	All right.
2170600	2170920	Okay.
2170960	2172240	Well, there's three of us.
2172280	2172680	All right.
2172760	2176440	I mean, I don't love it, but it's, it's, it deserves more credit.
2176440	2178600	I think it was Danny Aiello's best turn.
2179480	2183880	As I said to Heather Ann today, I mean, uh, Hey, all other movies.
2183920	2186480	Here's your medal for not trying.
2188200	2188640	What?
2190160	2195200	Hudson Hawk tries.
2195240	2195760	Yes.
2199400	2201920	I, I show the movie to friends once a year.
2202200	2204120	I make people watch it on my birthday.
2204120	2209280	Sometimes that Zana do Zana do Zana do is a, is a freaking freak out.
2209560	2212520	Then it's not a great movie and yet I'm fascinated by it.
2212520	2212840	Yep.
2213360	2217160	Is Zana do the one with the leather X that Connery wears?
2217320	2218680	No, that's Zardos.
2219680	2221640	Zardos is fucking a bummer.
2222280	2226840	Zardos, I want to like Zardos, but that, that movie does not want you to like it.
2226840	2233080	No, Zardos asks you to hate that movie because there's only so much
2233080	2238480	Sean Connery wearing, uh, underpants and high leather boots.
2238520	2238800	I know.
2238800	2240720	I already mentioned this and I can't remember the director's name,
2240720	2244200	but the director's commentary for Zardos does begin with the director
2244200	2247440	saying, hello, I'm so-and-so I directed Zardos and I'll be the first to
2247640	2249040	admit it kind of got away from me.
2251600	2252240	Let's proceed.
2255000	2256240	Got away from him.
2258000	2258680	Wow.
2259120	2261440	I mean, that is, the movie starts off.
2261480	2264360	The movie was, was the Rick and Morty episode.
2264360	2265600	I show me what you got.
2265600	2267560	That was, that was a Zardos riff, right?
2267880	2271840	Uh, well, the giant stone floating down.
2271880	2272040	Yeah.
2272040	2276200	The drop and loads of heads that are on the, uh, gazorpazorp planet with that,
2276200	2280160	that give all the sex dolls to the, to the male population, the surface
2280160	2283040	dollars, those heads are definitely Zardos heads.
2283600	2286000	Um, but they also are supposed to, they look a little bit like Nick
2286000	2290000	Manning, the porn star, and they drop loads and say drop and loads.
2290400	2291840	What happened to Nick Manning?
2291960	2293120	He disappeared.
2293960	2296720	He was in a Batman porn parody.
2297560	2297720	Yeah.
2297720	2298320	What year?
2298320	2299080	He's gone.
2299080	2301880	He's, his load dropped off the face of the earth.
2302360	2302840	Who?
2302880	2303880	Well, who are you talking about?
2303880	2305240	Do you know, do you know Nick Manning?
2305240	2305680	No.
2306120	2309360	Do you know, no, it's the, it's the younger.
2309360	2312760	It's the guy, you don't think there's a guy that every time he comes in a porno,
2312760	2314040	he says drop and loads.
2314080	2314400	I do.
2314400	2317200	I'm not, I'm happily unfamiliar with that.
2319480	2322120	It's like, it's like, he was, he was on stern a lot.
2322120	2325480	Like the stern was fascinated with it because he was the first porn star that
2325480	2330200	I know of that if you're like all these decades of, of, of, of porn movies, like
2330200	2334560	finally one male porn star just decided, well, how about if every time I come, I
2334600	2339040	say the same thing, no matter what movie I'm in, no one can fire me.
2339040	2339920	I just came.
2339960	2340960	Drop and load.
2341680	2347160	He's in the Batman, in the Batman one, he says drop and bat load.
2347200	2348800	Oh, I mean,
2351200	2353520	I think that might've been his shark.
2353960	2354680	Nick Manning.
2354680	2359440	If, if you're out there and you're in trouble, like, come tell us about it.
2359440	2360480	Why is he dropping them?
2360480	2362160	Dropping is so funny.
2365560	2369760	I know because it's not, I mean, it, it, it, somebody, I remember reading an
2369760	2374760	article about like there, you won't, you won't see a lot of, uh, male porn star
2374760	2381280	names it, they, they don't tend to go for like the Dick, uh, hard on, like they
2381280	2385760	don't, they try to, they, they steer, they steer clear of like, uh, kind of like
2385800	2394160	overtly, um, uh, kind of like e evocations of erectness and impenetrability and
2394160	2394760	things like that.
2394760	2398200	And, and, and I, there's some psychological reason for that.
2398720	2401640	Like, like, and, and so, and by the same token, that's probably why his catch
2401640	2406400	phrase isn't like shooting lasers, you know, he's just dropping loads.
2407000	2409240	It's like, is it, you want to throw it away.
2409240	2411120	You don't want to look what I do.
2411120	2411920	I fuck for a living.
2411920	2412400	I don't fuck.
2412400	2416240	I'm not, I'm not flash Gordon dropping loads.
2416600	2420280	I occasionally do a character on, uh, on our whose live shows where I'm the
2420280	2425000	world's oldest porn star and his name is Dusty loads.
2425040	2425400	Yeah.
2429480	2437840	Giving loads, granting, granting a subscription access to loads,
2439880	2443800	proffering loads, giving free loads with an in-app purchase.
2443800	2447360	Why is it a load?
2447560	2447760	Yeah.
2447760	2452120	That fucking Eagle song down the road, trying to loosen my load.
2452160	2453480	And that's the grossest lyric.
2453480	2456840	I'm all say, Hey Eagles, stop loosening your load.
2457560	2460040	You know, I've never come what I would call a load.
2460640	2462120	I've never come what I would call a load.
2462160	2463440	What would you call?
2463480	2464320	What would you call it?
2464360	2469960	No, no, like a teaspoon, you know, like a healthy teaspoon.
2469960	2477480	If I'm like, like, you know, I just like be queething teaspoon.
2479640	2485920	Proffering, proffering a healthy dose of medicine that chose nothing.
2486880	2488960	Be queething a teaspoon.
2490880	2492240	You know, it's a cool word.
2492480	2495200	Slake like a thirst.
2495240	2495640	Yeah.
2495640	2497320	That's the only thing that gets slaked.
2497360	2497720	Yeah.
2498000	2498440	Pretty cool.
2498440	2498480	Yeah.
2498480	2499520	Can you like anything else?
2499600	2500840	I don't think you can slake anything.
2500880	2501800	I mean, it probably can't.
2501800	2503080	English is a no wrong answer.
2503080	2507280	But can you slake a dragon or it's like a football?
2507280	2508680	You can slake a dragon of thirst.
2511360	2512960	You just like the dragon of thirst.
2512960	2513200	Yeah.
2513240	2519080	That's sprites new, uh, Superbowl halftime show slogan.
2519720	2521600	Slake the dragon of thirst.
2523840	2525360	Heather Ann, how's it going on?
2525400	2527080	Uh, how did this get played?
2527320	2528600	Uh, it's going well.
2528600	2532440	Um, we had to cancel our London show today and it made me real sad.
2532720	2533160	Damn.
2533480	2536360	When was the one that was this Saturday?
2536600	2537680	Is that going to wait?
2537680	2540120	No, that's not London, Comic Con or anything.
2540120	2542120	No, it's London podcast festival.
2542400	2543400	Why, why did you cancel?
2543560	2553840	Um, well, uh, secret, Brexit, Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.
2554080	2560520	Uh, no, uh, my, I don't know what the, the, the official reason that was put out
2560520	2563320	was, but my, uh, my co-host, uh, fell ill.
2563320	2564200	So we can't go.
2564560	2569320	Uh, and I hope he gets better, but I was super bummed out because I love London.
2569440	2569680	Yeah.
2569680	2570440	That's the best.
2570480	2570840	Yeah.
2570840	2571680	It's fucking great.
2571720	2572760	Who's the, who's the cost?
2572880	2575760	Uh, Nick Weiger, Nick Weiger from the sick guy.
2576160	2576720	Yes.
2578520	2579440	Sick guy sick.
2579440	2582880	Like, uh, but yeah, he's a, he fell ill.
2582880	2586680	So we can't go and, you know, I wonder if there's like some insurance reason why
2586680	2588280	that had to be a secret and now he's fucked.
2588320	2594040	I think it was the thing was that he, I don't think he want, you know, it's, he
2594040	2595760	didn't want to take all the ire for it.
2596280	2597640	Uh, but I just did that.
2597640	2598840	So, Oh, I see.
2599240	2601400	He didn't, he didn't want it to be because of him.
2601400	2606240	And yeah, yeah, but now, you know, now they know it was Nick.
2606400	2608640	Have you been having fun playing a bad video game?
2608640	2614240	That show is fun when we're recording and it's really miserable the
2614240	2616200	rest of the time because you're having a research.
2616240	2616600	Yeah.
2616600	2622480	So I play on Sundays, I play like maybe four or five to eight hours of a terrible
2622480	2627280	video game and that's my schedule, my scheduled time to do the thing for the
2627280	2629280	podcast and take a bunch of notes.
2629600	2632800	And I've had to give up like good video games.
2632960	2634760	I've had, I can't play any good ones.
2634920	2636080	I just play shit.
2636120	2638520	I can't help but think that that sounds a little fun.
2639520	2640680	We thought it would be.
2641280	2645120	And then our first episode in after the tape, Nick, Nick was like, I
2645120	2647160	think we have miscalculated.
2649200	2650200	How do you pick the games?
2650200	2653160	Like what, what you, you, you seek out games you know are going to be bad.
2653200	2653480	Yeah.
2653480	2657320	So, uh, either like via, if there's like a theme, then it'll be like a
2657320	2661320	metacritic, like what's the worst game in this genre?
2661640	2667200	Uh, today was, uh, the episode was about Seaman, the dreamcast virtual pet
2667440	2670720	because today is the 20th anniversary of the release of the dreamcast.
2671080	2672600	Uh, so we picked that game.
2672640	2673360	It sucked.
2673720	2676960	Uh, they all, they're all so bad.
2676960	2680840	Seaman, Seaman, Seaman is a colon drop on loads.
2680920	2681200	Yeah.
2683000	2686880	They really leaned into it with the press or the, the advertisements.
2686880	2687760	Are you taking off?
2688560	2689280	He'll be back.
2689280	2691680	You're going to, I have to go to the bathroom.
2691720	2692120	Okay.
2693800	2694600	I drink too much.
2694600	2695920	Are you going to drop loads?
2698200	2698720	All right.
2698720	2700280	Are you going to come into the toilet?
2707880	2709560	Don't get a turd pregnant.
2718240	2720200	If you do bring it on stage.
2720240	2721160	Yeah.
2722360	2725520	Do you, man, notable for having a microphone peripheral.
2725520	2726280	Am I mistaken?
2726520	2726760	Yeah.
2726760	2729560	There was a microphone that you snapped into the controller and the only way to
2729560	2731240	interact with the game was to talk to it.
2731280	2732920	No, not the only way.
2733000	2733400	Yeah.
2733600	2734880	Wait, go left, go right.
2734880	2736200	You can't, there is no go left.
2736200	2737480	There's only talking to Seaman.
2737480	2738240	There's only talking.
2738960	2740000	It fucking sucks.
2740000	2741640	I'm telling you, it fucking blows.
2742000	2743040	Cause it's dreamcast.
2743040	2744280	What year is this from?
2744280	2747200	Like, uh, like 2000, 1999, somewhere in there.
2747200	2749160	And you have to talk to it and say, go here, go there.
2749200	2750160	No, you just talked.
2750200	2751320	No, it doesn't go anywhere.
2751320	2752920	You just have breakfast.
2752920	2753320	What is it?
2754440	2755440	It grows up to it.
2755440	2756080	It grows up.
2756080	2759440	And then you talk to it and asks you questions and remembers your answers.
2759720	2760360	And then it...
2760360	2761400	Why is he Seaman?
2761840	2762720	Cause he's a fish.
2762800	2766840	Fish with a human face, a bald man's face.
2767320	2768080	Pretty unattractive.
2768080	2769760	I'm telling you, the show is a nightmare.
2771440	2773640	A grown ass man?
2773640	2777440	Yeah, a grown human man's face and the fish body.
2777440	2780280	And it's like a baby though, with a grown man's face.
2780280	2782440	What style of animation or like...
2782440	2783080	What?
2783080	2783840	Wait, what?
2784640	2786680	What are the visuals like on this?
2786680	2787520	Like, what does it look like?
2787520	2792520	So it's like a, you're looking at a fish tank and in the fish tank is a fish with a human face.
2792520	2793800	With a 3D kind of thing?
2793800	2796600	It's like PS1 graphics, PS2.
2796600	2797600	It's PS2 era.
2797600	2803560	I love that there has to be a tank in the video game to keep the fish from escaping the video game.
2803560	2804160	Well, it's...
2804600	2807840	And so is there an end to ground where you just interact with this fish?
2807840	2811000	You interact with it until it becomes an adult and then it goes away.
2814240	2816200	It's a metaphor for childbirth.
2816200	2820520	Wait, it goes away and then it scrolls credits?
2820520	2821200	Yeah.
2821200	2821720	Yes.
2821720	2822920	You start the game over.
2822920	2823760	Yes, that's...
2823760	2824400	For real.
2824400	2825360	That's for real.
2825360	2828200	On Thanksgiving, it comes back with a horrible girlfriend.
2829880	2831360	It's a poli sci major.
2831360	2834960	It's just problematizing every fucking thing on the table.
2835800	2837480	Does the fish talk back to you?
2837480	2838120	Yes.
2838120	2840400	And what is the vocal...
2840400	2841480	What does it sound like?
2841480	2842760	It's like...
2842760	2843480	David Cross.
2843520	2844080	It's like...
2844080	2845920	Here, I'll do my best impression.
2845920	2846760	It's like...
2848240	2848920	So...
2850720	2852560	How are you doing today?
2852560	2853280	No.
2854560	2856200	I'm asking you...
2856760	2858480	Like that, it's got a fucking attitude.
2859960	2860840	And do you have...
2860840	2864320	Is it like Sims where if you don't talk to it, it dies or do you have to...
2864320	2866840	If you don't talk to it, it gets stupid.
2867560	2870560	So you guys know, winning is it going away, I guess.
2870560	2872160	Yeah, winning is...
2872160	2878080	I would imagine losing is it just stays and eventually mass shoots and blames you in its letter.
2881520	2882520	Too soon?
2883800	2886560	There's one a week for the last 10 years.
2887280	2888160	I tried...
2888160	2893840	When I was playing it for the show, I found a list of all the words that it recognized.
2893840	2896760	And I just was reading the list to it.
2896760	2901160	To try and like hack its intelligence to make it like as smart as possible right away.
2901560	2905160	And that was not satisfying for either of us.
2906800	2908680	It's the worst way to play a bad game.
2908680	2914360	How does C-Man let you know that he's unsatisfied with your course of action?
2915240	2919200	Because he really is irritated all the time.
2919200	2921440	Like it's not a pleasant experience.
2921440	2923560	So I'm picturing the most uncomfortable thing.
2923560	2925880	I'm having anxiety right now just thinking about it.
2925880	2930720	I'm picturing a grown man's head on a fish body.
2930920	2933200	It sounds like a David Lynch movie.
2933200	2937600	If I go on my phone right now and type in C-Man, will I find it?
2940240	2946520	It's giving me flashbacks to this potentially traumatizing memory I had when I visited my sister's hospital.
2946520	2950520	And I believe I've shared on this podcast.
2950520	2953320	I remember going wandering around my sister's hospital.
2953320	2955320	She was institutionalized for Rett Syndrome.
2955320	2958800	It was a big state funded building.
2959680	2962320	Oh, it's so much worse than I thought.
2962320	2963760	This is really gross.
2963760	2966320	And I happened upon this grown man in a crib.
2966320	2970520	I was like eight years old and I'm peering into a crib because I just hear the sound of a guy going,
2970520	2972440	moo moo, moo moo.
2972440	2980160	And then I looked in and it was just a grown ass man with a mustache and a hot combed quaffed haircut.
2980160	2983400	Like somebody would come by and take real good care of him.
2983400	2986720	Like he looked like a handsome movie actor, but he was in a diaper.
2986720	2990480	And he was and he was calling out for his squeaky cow toy.
2990480	2999960	And so when I think of a grown adult man in a fish tank body and and him, yeah, I'm seeing it from a distance here.
2999960	3002680	It's not good. Yeah, you can hand the phone down.
3002680	3008800	I don't know about that. Yeah, pass it along. It looks like a life.
3008800	3015840	Yeah. Yeah. So he's designed to look like the the the customer.
3015840	3020960	Sure. I mean, it looks it looks like a gamer.
3020960	3024400	Yeah. A circa 1999 gamer.
3024400	3027280	He just swims around and just harangs you. Yeah. Yeah.
3027280	3029960	It makes you feel bad for not being a good friend.
3029960	3032600	No, I mean, like he'll be entertained once in a while.
3032600	3035200	And how does he express entertainment?
3035200	3038680	That's funny.
3038680	3041400	He did say something that really surprised me.
3041400	3048000	And I think I talked about this on our podcast. Here I am talking about it again.
3048000	3054640	So when we were playing it because we played in a room with a few people and at some point he was like,
3054640	3058760	so do you have a boyfriend? And I was like, no.
3058760	3062120	And he went, let me get this straight. You do not have a boyfriend.
3062120	3065000	And I went, no. And he goes, do you have a girlfriend?
3065000	3075840	And I went, yes. And he goes, ah, well, it must be hard being in a marginalized group inside of a marginalized portion of the population.
3075840	3080160	Wait, whoa. And I was like.
3080160	3084680	Wait, so. So I can't tell.
3084680	3091160	Is that woke or is that not woke? I mean, for 1999, it's super woke like he was not.
3091160	3096280	He wasn't like it's super sophisticated from a Turing's perspective.
3096280	3099000	How much information had you given it?
3099000	3105520	I told I talked about my family and my job like it knew enough about.
3105520	3112160	But when it said this, everybody in the room was like, Jesus Christ.
3112160	3119480	Turn it off. It's unplugged from the wall.
3119480	3128640	Well, I mean, you know, I know you've probably heard this already, but I think that most of us are listening to this and going, well, that sounds rad.
3128640	3133480	Both as an episode and as a game and as a job. But, you know, you're giving us the highlights.
3133480	3135400	Yeah. Yeah. It's torture. Yeah.
3135400	3141880	There was in order to play it with the guest, I had to have I had to keep one alive.
3141880	3148920	And the morning of the show, it died. I turned it on and it had floated up to the top of the tank.
3148920	3150960	Well, it can die. Yeah, it can die.
3150960	3159760	If you don't like because you have to make you the internal clock on the system regulates how often you feed it and you have to like keep the temperature on the water tank.
3159760	3162960	Like it's like a fancy what do you call it?
3162960	3164280	Tamagotchi Tamagotchi.
3164280	3171640	Yeah, it's like it's like the reason we all play video games to get away from it is it's a human relationship.
3171640	3178880	Yeah, it's so so that was why that day I had to power level it by just reading all of the words.
3179000	3182800	That it knew from like an Internet guy, but it didn't dig it.
3182800	3186320	No, it got super. Well, that sounds satanic.
3186320	3191000	You had to resurrect it by reciting words that it knew in its death.
3191000	3199400	No, I had a tennis satanum, terminus, Plato, lesbian.
3199400	3203040	Remember me. It's me.
3203040	3206480	Did you name it or is he always named Seaman? You know, you can name him.
3206480	3209480	What did you name your seat? Well, I named my Seaman Mike.
3209480	3214640	I named him Nick. OK, so that because I thought that would make Nick uncomfortable.
3214640	3216480	Did it did? Yes, it did.
3216480	3219120	Hell yeah. Yeah.
3219120	3225520	But yeah, that was it ever like bring back that that you're gay or that you're like you're like a lesbian.
3225520	3228080	Did it ever like like? Yeah, it remembered it.
3228080	3231520	Did it ever lord that over you in any way? No, Lord, no.
3231520	3234200	Lord it over.
3234200	3238600	No, it remembered it, though, later and was like, so how is your girlfriend?
3238600	3241080	I'm like, she's fine. Is she there?
3241080	3245080	And I was like, no. And it's like too bad. So I have a shot.
3249680	3252040	That's so fucked up. Yeah, it's super fucked up.
3252040	3257280	I that's really I played Sims for a while and I hated it.
3257280	3263400	It made me feel like there's a lot of weird anxiety
3263400	3267040	because if there's just all of a sudden there's flies in the kitchen.
3267040	3269880	Yeah, because you didn't do.
3269880	3273640	You know, I don't I don't get stuff that you can neglect as part of a game.
3273640	3275280	That freaks me the fuck out.
3275280	3277800	And I'm like, I am here to neglect my life.
3277800	3281160	And then they just start walking into a wall and banging their head against the wall
3281160	3284360	and sobbing and weird computer. Yeah.
3284360	3286880	Yeah, that's my favorite part.
3286880	3290520	I don't mind things that paying attention to them makes them grow.
3290520	3293480	Like, like, you know, like I'll literally just grow fucking plants
3293480	3295960	on some iPad game for a year.
3295960	3301000	But like the idea of like them wilting or getting weeds because I didn't do enough.
3301000	3302840	Yeah, I just won't. I won't.
3302840	3304320	It's a deal breaker for me.
3304320	3307080	And it's crazy the shit that's not a deal breaker for me,
3307320	3313120	especially in like these like these sort of like soccer mom games that I play now.
3313120	3314600	Like I haven't played.
3314600	3317360	The reason your job sounds fun is because at least you're on a console.
3317360	3319320	Like I just like have left that life.
3319320	3322800	Like I sit in a in bed and listen to true crime podcasts.
3322800	3327520	And I just have like I've by my own volition, like with Cody begging me,
3327520	3329480	please play Minecraft so I can get some sleep.
3329480	3332840	Like, I'm just like, I don't know why I have just like circling this drain
3332840	3336360	where I'm just playing these increasingly banal games.
3336360	3339680	Like I'm just I'm playing shop titans now or something.
3339680	3340120	What's called this?
3340120	3343080	Like you just you just run a shop and you just keep making weapons.
3343360	3346720	People that are going on adventures that are not part of the game
3346720	3349840	are coming in, buying weapons from you and leaving the game
3349840	3352640	so they can go play a video game.
3352640	3356600	And my job is to keep the shelves stocked so I don't disappoint them.
3357200	3358440	That's how I win.
3358440	3360480	And what I win is more shelf space.
3362040	3364080	And I've already put like 20 bucks into it.
3364080	3366360	Don't even fucking let me kid you.
3367560	3371800	And like, oh, well, I can't wait for this wing of my story to be finished.
3372320	3374560	I'll buy some diamonds.
3374560	3377360	Anyways, I sound a lot less happy than I am.
3377360	3380680	So you're like, you're like a Forged in Fire guy
3380680	3383760	that you just make weapons and then people come into your forage.
3383920	3386160	The honest to God truth is I'm not even making them there.
3386160	3387640	I'm actually subcontracting.
3387640	3390120	There's there's other kit.
3390120	3393160	I just run a store. That's it.
3393160	3396280	It's like there's a woman that makes all the magic stuff.
3396280	3398480	There's a guy that makes all of the.
3398480	3400640	So you're just like the you're not even the barista.
3400640	3402360	You're just you're just the run of the cashier.
3402400	3403760	I'm like a man, your management.
3403760	3407880	Yeah, I'm like I'm like I'm I'm I'm absolutely unnecessary.
3408040	3411280	Like in a proper society, I wouldn't exist.
3411280	3414120	I am what Lennon probably called the bourgeois.
3414120	3415720	What was it? What am I?
3415720	3418400	I'm a parasite. Yeah, bourgeoisie.
3421960	3425560	So and now that gave sounds like a great one for the podcast.
3426360	3430520	Well, then everything in the game, the appeal for you, Dan, is what?
3430520	3433400	The lack of responsibility is no appeal.
3433400	3438320	It's a it's a it's a it's a it's a hamster bottle filled with dopamine spikes.
3438520	3441360	He's just like lapping at it out of habit
3441360	3445240	because the last time I laughed at it, things lit up and said five.
3445240	3446800	And I want to see it say six.
3446800	3450800	It is the engineers that make these games have figured it out.
3450840	3453360	There is it's it's a nicotine patch.
3453360	3456040	It's a it's a it's a tobacco pouch.
3456040	3459080	It's fucking it's a it's a sharp toothpick.
3459080	3464520	You keep picking at the bloody gum with it's a fucking it's cutting.
3467040	3468920	That sounds great.
3469800	3472440	I'm playing a game kind of like that called merge dragons.
3472440	3474400	It's like the worst.
3474400	3476640	It's the worst game that I've ever played.
3476640	3478080	I went through a merge phase.
3478080	3479160	Yeah, I'm not surprised.
3479160	3482560	It seems like the kind of like it's like I don't like those games.
3482560	3484440	I like mechanics that are real.
3484440	3485800	But boy, howdy.
3485800	3490600	When you drag three rocks or if you're lucky, five rocks together
3490720	3493720	and they become a slightly bigger rock.
3493760	3496040	It's like, oh, damn.
3496040	3499960	But I've had days ruined where I go to drag five rocks together
3499960	3502480	and I accidentally only drag three rocks together.
3502480	3503560	Oh, man.
3503560	3507120	Like my stomach just sinks like I'm about to get in a car wreck.
3507120	3510280	It's there's some highs and lows in merge dragons.
3511240	3514960	It's the only genre of game, I think, like this should be a tip off to us
3515000	3518640	that it's not it's like there's no way to parody that style of game.
3518680	3521760	Like you couldn't we did a joke game a million years ago
3521760	3523360	that was like called Jerry's game.
3523360	3525360	It was like Jerry was playing it in the thing.
3525360	3527960	And there's there's an actual game called Jerry's game.
3527960	3529600	It's just a bunch of balloons and you just pop them.
3529600	3533040	But there are still a thousand people out there popping the fucking balloons.
3533040	3535840	Like I won't go near it because I'm afraid one will be me.
3536080	3539320	And like like just think like I want to pop a million balloons.
3539320	3543200	And like you can't therefore like like famously
3543200	3547200	some of the most successful game game designers.
3547480	3551320	Like it wasn't the Flappy Bird guy like doing it as a bit or something.
3551320	3552760	Yeah, I think Flappy Bird was a bit.
3552760	3554960	There's like there's like there's like there's like
3554960	3557560	there's like a lot of stories about people like going like,
3557840	3560520	so what if I just do this, like people will play it?
3560520	3562560	And the answer is yes.
3562560	3565680	Like like because they bother to put like this aesthetic into it.
3565680	3568280	I think it's just colors and sounds and things.
3568280	3570400	It all comes down to just this feel.
3570400	3571920	It's a slot machine feel.
3571920	3574560	It's like like you when you merge those dragons,
3574560	3579160	when you water that plant and it's like there's a certain textural experience.
3579160	3581040	That's why they tell you to put your phone in grayscale
3581040	3582440	because we're primates.
3582440	3587520	Those brains are designed to find ripe fruit like the way we
3587840	3590920	if we can locate things that look right and feel right
3590920	3594400	and we can walk backward in our brains to eliminate
3594400	3598120	the most amount of work possible to get that lemon.
3598840	3602880	We reward ourselves with heroin that we generate in our own brain
3602880	3605680	and we are all Keith Richards at this point.
3606280	3608880	That would be awesome to make a satirical version of the game.
3608880	3612320	Like it would probably be very hard, but like super awesome.
3612320	3616880	How would you? I mean, you know, is it's just like it's not a satire.
3616880	3619120	And is it not? I mean, I got addicted to that game.
3619120	3623440	Like I I I really want to do an incremental clicker for Rick and Morty
3623440	3627520	because I mean, like the idea of prestige and fitting in with timelines and stuff,
3627520	3630640	but whatever. Do you think there's a game that you could design
3630640	3633400	that could end civilization?
3633400	3637480	Like because all this stuff you just said is, I think, pretty correct.
3637960	3641880	But I feel like somebody with maybe without a moral center
3641880	3645480	could harness all of those things and like really
3645720	3649200	because like Pokemon Go kind of stopped everyone for a summer.
3649240	3653040	Right. Right. Like everybody stopped doing the thing.
3653040	3657280	Like we everybody would. Oh, man. Yeah. I got it. OK. Great.
3657280	3660360	Pokemon Go, except it just makes people go to locations
3660360	3662920	that are like away from a bank or something.
3662920	3665320	And then you just rob the bank or commit crimes
3665320	3668360	that are synchronized towards where you're directing these people.
3669200	3671240	I know you could take over the world.
3671600	3675480	There was I think it's like a rerun, but it's I this is semantically,
3675480	3679640	but I think thematically related to the current thing
3679640	3684680	that's up in the rotation for Radiolab is about this British game show.
3684840	3686400	That's basically the prisoner's dilemma.
3686400	3688320	It's called Golden Balls.
3688320	3691160	And it's just the prisoner's dilemma, you know what that is.
3691160	3693960	And it's like I think in the in the final round of this game,
3693960	3696760	what they do is they give they give the two finalists
3697120	3698680	a pair of golden balls.
3698680	3701960	One says split, the other says steel on it.
3702360	3705800	If they both they both talk to each other about promising
3705800	3711600	which one they're going to do and the the if they both choose to split,
3712240	3714480	they split the jackpot.
3714480	3717840	If one of them chooses to split and the other one chooses to steal,
3717840	3720240	the person that steals gets 100 percent of the money.
3720440	3723800	If they both choose to steal, they get nothing, both of them.
3724080	3730760	So the constant thing is like, how why would you ever choose to split?
3731480	3736960	Even if you're not a bad person, you're so afraid of being fucked
3737200	3740360	that you may as well preemptively try to fuck the other person.
3740360	3742200	And it's kind of like what the prisoner's dilemma is,
3742200	3745000	which is the technique that cops use to separate suspects.
3745000	3747920	And they say, your friend's in the other room telling me that you rob the bank.
3747920	3748960	What do you think?
3748960	3750360	And they'll get false confessions that way.
3750360	3753600	Little unreal ones, because what are you what are you supposed to do
3753600	3757560	if you can't see your friend and go, let's just both tell them they got nothing?
3758680	3761560	The there was and the story is about a guy
3761560	3764840	who was like a game show expert who's been on like 46 game shows
3764840	3770120	and he went on the show and kind of broke it by saying to the other guy,
3771120	3774240	listen, I promise you, I'm going to steal.
3775080	3781960	So if you say split, I'll get all the money and I'll split it with you
3782560	3788400	after the show and the guy, but the guy was like, they argued for an hour
3788560	3791200	and the audience was booing the guy because it was just like
3791200	3792600	he was just doing it wrong.
3792600	3798120	You know, he was meta and it was like it was he but also he wasn't negotiating.
3798600	3801520	He was simply saying, I'm drawing a hard line.
3801720	3805400	I promise you, I'm going to do the bad thing.
3805480	3808000	Therefore, you can bank on it.
3808000	3811200	If you also steal, we both get nothing.
3811280	3816440	You may as well choose split because it was
3816680	3819880	it was the practical way to kind of beat the game.
3820840	3823680	And also, then I think as an added fuck you to the game,
3823760	3826720	the guy chose split the other guy.
3826880	3829880	And then the hero guy also chose split.
3829880	3833720	So they just split the money after doing all that for hours.
3833840	3834760	I think he just changed.
3834760	3837000	I think he just decided that would be extra hilarious.
3837680	3840880	But the other guy, this is what's interesting to me.
3841200	3844920	The other guy said in his post kind of interview about it,
3845080	3847520	you know, he talks about how upset he was with this other guy.
3847520	3848840	He's like, he wasn't he's not listening to me.
3848840	3852120	It's like, here's my big time at this game show that's been running for three seasons.
3852120	3853080	Like, this is the thing.
3853080	3856360	It's like you promise the other person you play this game, you lock these horns.
3856480	3859120	And the guy is just like fucking laying out this meta bullshit
3859120	3862360	and he won't listen to fucking reason and he's making really upset.
3862720	3865000	But in the end, the guy chose split.
3865000	3869760	And by his full honest admission after the fact, he's like, oh, yeah,
3869760	3872080	I was definitely going to steal no matter what.
3872840	3874640	But that's the one thing he didn't do.
3874920	3878080	He the guy, in other words, the guy chose the only behavior
3878080	3883920	that changed another person whose whose attitude about the world was predetermined.
3884200	3889160	The only behavior was, you know, I would call it honesty again, but whatever.
3889280	3890400	I don't know if that's related.
3890400	3893800	Like, as far as a game that could shut down civilization,
3894240	3897560	it's interesting to me that just in terms of game theory,
3897560	3901000	there always is this like odd meta choice
3901000	3903760	that you can use to just short circuit everything.
3905160	3908560	It's kind of it's kind of what people who would be like stoked
3908560	3912040	about Trump's election would say that that's what his election was like.
3912040	3915120	Well, let's just let's just elect the fucking like
3916320	3920200	the unelectable like, like, like, why are we even doing this anymore?
3920480	3921800	Like, why, why, why?
3921800	3923720	OK, I'll choose that.
3923720	3927840	Like, like, let's shut this Mountain Dew contest down, you know.
3929200	3932000	Let's shut this Mountain Dew contest down.
3932280	3934440	And now we're all so happy.
3934440	3936800	Yeah, we've been liberated.
3937240	3940920	Can I tell I don't I was blackout drunk last time you were on, but like.
3942280	3945360	Oh, you did you listen to the episode afterwards?
3945360	3946160	No. All right, great.
3946160	3948080	I don't want to listen to that.
3948080	3951480	I'm a fucking drunk guy, like trying to have a show he can't handle.
3953400	3958120	But I did I did I ask for your permission and or share the thing
3958120	3963440	you told me about the the the election when you you told me that you
3963960	3966440	you did the thing and then you took a picture and then you did.
3966560	3968400	I don't think we talked about that.
3968400	3971280	I don't I don't I don't remember.
3971280	3972760	Are you opposed to sharing that?
3972760	3974960	No, no, I'm I'm totally.
3975640	3979760	This is like this will ruin the thing, but I'll talk about the thing.
3979880	3981360	Wait, what ruin what thing?
3981360	3984480	If I say what I did, holy shit, it won't work.
3984960	3985720	Oh, it won't work.
3985720	3986920	Yes, yes, I know. I know.
3986920	3989120	But I'll say the thing.
3989120	3992680	It's kind of worth it, because until we all die, you'll you'll
3995120	3997120	like I'm in awe of you.
3997120	3999920	What are you guys talking about?
3999920	4003560	This is the most tantalizing and enigmatic.
4003920	4008800	When when when the election was between Hillary and Trump and the others,
4009800	4013080	I went to my voting place.
4013520	4017200	I was I'm so I was so scared that Trump was going to win
4017520	4022120	that I went to my voting place and I I voted for Trump,
4022440	4027440	took a photo of it with my phone, took out the thing, brought the ballot up.
4027440	4028880	And I went, I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
4028880	4029800	And I have another ballot.
4029800	4031160	They threw that ballot out.
4031160	4033880	And then I got another ballot and then voted correctly.
4033880	4036880	So that if they come to my door
4037640	4042760	and they're like, they're like, you know, the the the jack boots are there.
4042760	4048000	Right. I'll be able to pull out my phone and be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4050360	4052960	Wait, that was that was the actual motivation for that?
4052960	4054400	Yeah, yeah. Really, really?
4054400	4056360	Self preservation. Yeah, yeah.
4056360	4058560	It wasn't just a bit like this will be hilarious to my friends.
4058560	4059720	No, no, it was.
4059720	4062080	I haven't ever this will get this will get you out of it.
4062080	4064400	I haven't said that's fucking cynical.
4064400	4068080	And now now it does. Now it's over there.
4069760	4072840	I'm sorry. They'll be like, no, we listened.
4073040	4075520	We love Harbin Town.
4075520	4077720	They do. We're hip to that jive.
4077720	4082080	Then I will say, then I will say, yes, but that was a liberal audience.
4082080	4086200	So I had to tell them that I ended up throwing the ballot away.
4086440	4088280	But really, I was so proud of my vote.
4088280	4090880	And they'll say, you said that on the podcast. Right.
4093520	4097960	I like that you're endowing the Trump faction with forethought
4097960	4100600	and like like like wisdom of any kind.
4100600	4103920	I just sabotage you out of jealousy because when I'm in the firing line,
4103920	4108680	I know I'm like, fucking Heather, like I want you next to me.
4108680	4111600	I mean, that's the really only fun thing about getting shot by Nazis.
4111600	4114520	Or is this your way, Heather, of of trying to cover your ass
4114520	4117000	because you actually voted for Trump and you want.
4117000	4119360	But she wouldn't have she wouldn't have had to explain that.
4119360	4124680	Yeah, no, no, no, she's she's she's being like, like, like, like three steps ahead.
4124680	4127800	Oh, because her phone got hacked by move on dot org zealots.
4128520	4131800	And she's afraid that any day now that she knows what's in her photo roll.
4131800	4133680	Yeah, that's my God damn it.
4133680	4136040	That photo I took when I proudly voted for Trump.
4136040	4138520	I also made a lot of money on the election.
4139000	4139880	You did? Yeah.
4139880	4142640	Because I was I was so sure he was going to win that I
4143280	4147600	the February prior to the election, there's a website called Predict It
4147600	4150080	where you can gamble on politics.
4150080	4153440	And I was so sure that he was going to win that you could buy.
4153480	4157240	So the way it works is that you buy a share based on the percentage of likelihood
4157240	4158400	that something will happen.
4158400	4164120	So if the payout is a dollar and it's 11 percent likely that a thing will happen,
4164320	4169880	you buy each share for 11 cents and then it cashes out at a dollar if the thing happens.
4170200	4173720	And so I bought a lot of Trump at 11 cents
4173720	4175640	because I was like, he's definitely going to win.
4175640	4176480	How much you make?
4176480	4177600	Thousands of dollars.
4177600	4182640	What? Which I left on the exchange because I felt so sick.
4182640	4186400	I knew he was going to win and I got nothing except just sadness.
4187720	4189080	He's also going to win next time, everybody.
4189080	4190040	So buckle up.
4190040	4193560	And Jeff, think about if that website was around when 9-11 happened, huh?
4195680	4197800	Jeff knew 9-11 was going to happen.
4197800	4199560	I didn't know 9-11 was going to happen.
4199960	4201600	What? I didn't know.
4203760	4207560	Rob Shrob, you remember you called me up like I called Dan.
4208000	4209480	You called me. Did I?
4209480	4212440	Yeah, you called me at my place when I lived on Talmage and you called me up
4212440	4216120	and I'd already had a panic attack because I thought that the world was going to collapse on me
4216120	4217320	and everyone was going to die.
4217320	4220760	And it was my job to pray for people on the other side of the world
4220760	4222320	because a horrible thing was happening.
4222320	4224800	And I thought the walls were going to collapse of me.
4224800	4229240	And then I finally calmed down after like a half hour of like a full on panic attack.
4229720	4232440	And Shrob called me up and goes, you told me that the
4234120	4236920	the World Trade Center tower has had gone down.
4237240	4238560	The Pentagon got hit.
4238560	4240560	You also told me the White House got hit.
4240560	4243160	But there was there was like you had some misinformation on that.
4243160	4245600	And you said turning your TV right now.
4245600	4248160	But it was you that called me and said that that was all going down.
4248160	4250960	So you were having a panic attack before the television was on?
4251400	4254120	Yes, I woke up and looking back on it.
4254960	4257600	I remember looking at the clock and it was like
4258200	4261480	nine, eleven six oh.
4261480	4263000	My clock said nine.
4263000	4264600	Well, it's upside down six.
4264600	4267800	It was it was like six six oh three or six oh four, whatever it was.
4267800	4271640	But that was when like nine oh three or nine oh four, whatever it was,
4271880	4274280	is when the second plane hit the tower.
4274280	4279080	But I just woke up screaming and thought that the walls of my apartment
4279080	4281160	were going to come smashing down on me.
4281160	4283120	And I thought I was going to die.
4283120	4284360	And I just kept screaming.
4284360	4287120	And then I realized, no, it's not me that's in danger.
4287120	4288920	It's people very far away.
4288920	4290920	And my job was to pray for them.
4290920	4294520	And I finally come down after a half hour of just wailing screaming.
4294520	4296320	And then Rob caught me up and said, turn your TV on.
4297840	4298840	And then.
4299800	4303080	And if you want to be the new Camille, you can engage this.
4304320	4307080	Camille was like, are you fucking kidding me?
4308040	4309880	You dreamt 9-11.
4310280	4312040	Wait, can you do a Camille?
4312040	4316000	I my dream is to do a fucking Camille nonceani impression.
4316000	4318120	It's impossible to do your best Camille.
4318120	4319280	No, no, I just tried.
4319280	4320640	I just did. It was good.
4320640	4322160	I was going to walk away with those winnings.
4322160	4323080	But keep keep going.
4323080	4325760	It's fucking I want to learn how to keep going.
4325880	4330880	And I had a fucking insane record breaking nightmare
4331760	4333680	a couple of days ago.
4333680	4336520	You know, sometimes we have these amorphous like dream within a dream
4336520	4339640	kind of things where it's sort of like like the ingredients are like,
4340000	4342560	oh, I didn't know I was asleep, but I kind of felt like in my dream,
4342560	4343560	I was asleep or something like that.
4343560	4345960	But I had a full blown like.
4346920	4351400	I I was having a nightmare
4352320	4355440	about like someone being in my house.
4356600	4359520	And I woke up.
4359520	4363920	Like freaking out, like, huh, huh, like, like kind of panicked
4363920	4366720	and almost unable to breathe, like semi-sleep paralysis,
4366720	4368840	like coming out of the nightmare.
4368840	4372520	And Cody woke up and and was like, what's wrong?
4372520	4374800	And I'm like, I just had this crazy fucking nightmare
4374800	4378400	and all this stuff like full on that whole thing.
4378680	4382840	And then stayed awake, tried to go back to sleep
4383600	4386720	and then heard more stuff in my house and got up
4386720	4391040	and was walking around that house, which, by the way, was not my house
4391040	4394000	because everything I just described was a nightmare.
4394000	4398560	I then woke up from because that was all a dream, bitch.
4399200	4400520	All of it.
4400520	4401880	Do you understand what I'm saying?
4401880	4404960	So when I woke up, I was like, I was like, and I had like genuine
4404960	4406680	like sleep paralysis was like, ah, ah.
4406680	4410080	And in my real bed, like like Cody was like, what's wrong?
4410080	4411880	And I'm like, you know what's wrong.
4411880	4415000	No, you don't know what's wrong because this is a different bed
4415000	4416240	in a different house.
4416240	4420800	But I was like in a different house that was also unfurnished
4420880	4424200	and wasn't a house I had ever lived in, but was living in with Cody
4424200	4426880	in just a bed, but like had no furniture.
4426880	4430200	It was like a big house and was like scary to walk around
4430440	4435640	when you heard a sound and had this whole fucking nightmare in a nightmare.
4436080	4436920	God damn it.
4436920	4438040	You should be more impressed.
4438040	4442160	It was like it was it was like it was just cliche.
4442200	4444160	I mean, like it doesn't usually work that way.
4444160	4449280	Like I literally dreamt I was in bed dreaming and didn't know.
4449320	4452440	Sometimes you know, you know, like you kind of know or whatever.
4452520	4454160	But it was just thought I'd share that.
4454160	4456960	What are you going to do? Cancel me?
4457360	4461120	Dan Harmon has been canceled after sharing a double layered nightmare.
4462600	4465040	Speaking of canceling, I was away on a trip,
4465040	4467520	but apparently the show is coming to an end.
4467520	4469840	Yeah, we should announce that formally
4469840	4473400	for the vast minority of people who didn't catch dance Instagram stream.
4473720	4475120	We're going to we're going to stop.
4475120	4477240	We're going to stop doing the show in December.
4477840	4480920	When like at the end of December or the first?
4480920	4485280	Well, probably more the early December since the we probably won't be around
4485280	4489640	to do shows for like, you know, when everybody leaves for for the holidays.
4489680	4493680	So we got some amazing guests coming up to make who?
4493880	4495560	Who are you? Who's coming?
4495560	4496840	Who's coming out of the show?
4496840	4502560	Ed Neumeier, who Robocop, who screenwriter of Robocop?
4502600	4503600	He didn't play Robocop.
4503600	4505080	There's silence.
4505080	4508080	Yeah, he's refused to come for years.
4508080	4510200	He was like, if you really want me, you'll end the show.
4510200	4512880	We got Laszlo Panaflex.
4512880	4516240	There's Flula Borg, the famous YouTuber.
4517480	4519840	They got a nice better than a new one.
4520040	4523240	To to applaud applauds.
4523560	4526640	To applaud a single applause from a single individual.
4527920	4530000	Dave Foley, Dave Foley is going to be here.
4530000	4531800	Hey, let's go.
4531800	4534040	PewDiePie, I think is coming by now is out of time.
4536960	4540800	We're all going to subscribe to him while he's here or be killed.
4543560	4545800	I had a dream. Can I tell you a dream?
4545800	4548760	Yes, I had a dream when I had cancer that blew my fucking mind
4549200	4550680	and gave me a lot of peace.
4550680	4553840	And it was that I lived all the way to the end of my life
4554120	4559520	and was an old woman and was still still with my girlfriend, Mary.
4559520	4564360	And we have spoken in the in the past about how I want to
4564360	4568160	if if uploading your consciousness becomes a possibility,
4568160	4570840	like if you can dump your load into a computer
4571560	4573840	that drop that.
4574960	4577280	Sorry, sorry, sorry, damn it.
4577280	4578880	Fuck. Fuck.
4578880	4580440	I knew what you meant.
4580440	4581440	Fuck.
4583080	4586440	But if Heather, wake up, it was it was all a dream, it was all a dream
4587400	4590800	because you're a head in a jar.
4591680	4596200	So I dreamt that we got all the way to the old age and we could do it.
4596760	4598720	You can upload your consciousness into a computer.
4598720	4601040	And I was like, I want to do it. We got a big fight.
4601040	4603120	And I was like, well, OK, I won't do it.
4603120	4607200	But then I did it anyway, which will be the way it works.
4608640	4612280	And in the dream, once I was in the computer,
4612280	4617200	my POV of the dream became inside of the computer version of me.
4617520	4622480	And I discovered that your entire life was like an old iPod interface
4622480	4626080	with like the the scrolling album covers
4626320	4628920	and that you could go back to any part of your life
4629240	4632560	and click on a thing emotionally, mentally
4632840	4636080	and replay that experience that you had in your life.
4636080	4640800	And then I discovered that you could branch the narrative
4641000	4644720	from within the experience to see what would have happened
4644720	4646640	if you'd made other choices
4646640	4651600	and then realized that when we talk about the reality is a simulation,
4651600	4655680	that it's not a grand simulation for all users,
4655680	4659960	but that each user is simulating their memories of the universe
4660960	4663720	and making different choices over and over again,
4663720	4666680	getting all the way to the end, realizing you're still in a computer
4666880	4670320	and then playing the game from that point all the way backwards.
4670320	4671640	Does that make sense? Yeah, I know.
4671640	4672400	That was my dream.
4672400	4675440	And then I was like, Oh, so if I die of cancer in this one,
4675440	4678760	I'll just wake up in the computer and then I'll be like, Oh, great.
4678760	4683640	So I know I know this time when I play that I won't, you know, I don't fall.
4684440	4688240	You know, what's crazy about downloading your brain into the computer?
4689080	4692680	Like, unless they decide to then kill your body,
4693000	4695120	your brain will also still exist.
4695120	4697600	Like, it doesn't just pour out of your brain.
4697600	4700040	Like, it'll it would presumably get copied over
4700040	4703120	rather than like literally jammed into a floppy disk.
4703120	4707240	So you just simultaneously exist as this entity on the computer
4707240	4711440	while your body still exists unless, again, a scientist kills it for you.
4711760	4713560	Do you think?
4713560	4716120	I thought it was cool. Do you think it?
4716120	4719840	Do you think do you think this probably is just hokum?
4719840	4721320	Like, why would I pull this out of my ass?
4721320	4722400	This is all nonsense.
4722400	4726400	My gut, my gut tells me that before we get to
4726680	4729360	I'm going to put this bowl on your head and your brain information
4729360	4731440	is going to come out, throw a hose, and then your brain is just
4731440	4734280	you can just outpatient walk out and go, what did you do today?
4734280	4735360	Oh, I copied my brain.
4735360	4738240	It's in a computer right now that the technology will first have to go
4738240	4740560	through a phase where you absolutely can't get that information
4740560	4744760	without destroying its original vessel, that it's like going to have to like
4744760	4750160	like if it's actually going to pull every bit out of that fucking bowl of tapioca,
4750160	4752120	it's got to fucking stir it.
4752120	4755280	And that stirring your brain is well, that's what happened to Kennedy.
4755280	4758200	I mean, you get your brain stirred by bullets like that.
4760760	4764160	Also, other people, too, it's plenty of people.
4764160	4769000	But I had a conversation at this at this wedding I was at with a friend
4769000	4771840	and I was talking about it because I was talking about that Casey Affleck movie
4771840	4774080	where he's got the sheet over him, the ghost story movie.
4774080	4775200	Have you seen that? No.
4775200	4777240	It's really like heart wrenching,
4777240	4780680	particularly because it disarms you with this hokey hipster thing.
4780680	4782240	It's just Casey Affleck in a sheet.
4782240	4785640	So it like it divorces you from the Patrick Swayze mythology
4785640	4790240	of like people being ghosts and being like green screened and like, whoa, my fingers.
4791280	4795920	And it really forces you psychologically to contemplate one of the more
4796800	4799520	what I found to be the stunning facts of death,
4799520	4802560	which is that were you to die and were you to hang around,
4802800	4805680	you would be watching your lover
4806520	4810360	like not get over you like in Spielberg's
4810880	4814080	whatever it was with Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter, but like purple.
4814320	4816680	Like, no, that's not.
4816680	4820880	But like watching your girlfriend like lose her house keys
4820880	4824440	and like eat a whole blueberry pie because someone told her it was vegan,
4824440	4827000	but then throw it up because she doesn't know what to do with herself
4827000	4827640	and people are coming.
4827640	4834440	But just watching your friends and lovers mourn your passing
4834440	4837800	while you stood there and watch it just devastated me.
4838000	4841840	And it made me realize that the thing I fear about death
4842160	4846720	more than, oh, my God, I'm going to die is like, holy shit.
4848480	4851880	I what if I what if I don't just go away?
4851880	4854040	What if I have to think about?
4855040	4860840	Cody like like and and her having to like put all this energy into my loss,
4860840	4864760	like, oh, that's the last thing I want is for anyone to have to expend
4865000	4868040	fucking tears for me and all this nonsense.
4868360	4870720	And then and then that and then we started talking about like,
4870720	4874680	so if you could avoid that, would you?
4874680	4878040	And I posed a hypothetical to her.
4878040	4880960	This friend I was talking to at the wedding where I was like, so say you
4881680	4885520	someone came to you and said today, they said, hey, listen,
4885520	4887800	I'm from the Umbrella Corporation.
4887800	4892160	I we have a program called the semen.
4892640	4894280	Like you'll come back to that.
4894280	4898800	No, I thought like like like we like like for whatever reason,
4899320	4901280	we have selected you as a candidate.
4901280	4903920	Like we don't know when you're going to die or how you're going to die.
4903920	4907320	But if you die instantly, like if you participate in this program,
4907800	4914040	you may wake up in a hard drive or ideally,
4914040	4918280	maybe let's say even just in a clone body like like like that was a clone of your
4918280	4920920	body like like we were working out the kinks.
