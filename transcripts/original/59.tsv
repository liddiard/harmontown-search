0	1000	Wait for it.
1000	2000	Who knows Crass?
2000	3000	Nobody?
3000	4000	No.
4000	5000	No.
5000	6000	No.
6000	7000	No.
7000	8000	No.
8000	9000	No.
9000	10000	No.
10000	11000	No.
11000	12000	No.
12000	13000	No.
13000	14000	No.
14000	15000	No.
15000	15000	
31000	32000	No.
37000	41000	Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics.
41000	46000	Perman bone is it session again.
48000	49000	Yeah.
51140	51740	I love the song.
51740	59500	No one knows Crass and I got punk band from the 70s.
59500	60500	One, two, three, four.
61500	62500	I'm Jeff Davis, the Comptroller.
62500	63500	Welcome to the stage.
63500	66500	You're Mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
73500	74500	Thank you.
75500	77500	The stage is down again.
77500	80500	I thought that was a permanent thing that they were going to raise the stage.
81500	84500	I pick the worst ways to open shows.
85500	86500	I can't.
86500	87500	Especially podcasts.
87500	89500	That visual stuff.
89500	92500	Yeah, I don't think I've ever done it right, have I?
92500	93500	No.
93500	95500	You came out with your shirt off a couple times.
95500	96500	Yeah.
96500	101500	Is that right or is that just like a symptom of how nervous I am about how to start the show?
101500	102500	I think it's exhilarating.
103500	105500	You made some bad choices with that music.
105500	106500	What was going on?
108500	111500	My only bad choice, I thought the song started right away.
111500	112500	I forgot there was kids playing stuff.
113500	115500	There's like eight different beginnings of the song.
115500	118500	It was like George Bush saying no new taxes.
120500	124500	There was like dialogue from a Kung Fu movie and Freddy Krueger came out.
124500	129500	I think it was like little kids playing hopscotch or a skip rope or some business.
129500	132500	Well, we're here now and now the show's underway.
132500	133500	It doesn't matter.
133500	135500	It doesn't matter how you start.
135500	139500	It doesn't matter if you come up and talk about how low the stage is.
139500	141500	The entertainment is always just around the corner.
142500	144500	Not that our goal is to be entertaining.
144500	145500	It's a town meeting, right, Jeff?
145500	146500	Right.
146500	148500	Our comptroller, Jeff Davis, is here.
148500	150500	Let's have a hand for him as always.
150500	152500	He doesn't get paid for this.
152500	155500	He does it for the love of government.
156500	157500	Yeah.
157500	158500	I love rules.
158500	160500	I love governing.
160500	164500	Speaking of government, please, I can't recommend highly enough.
164500	167500	I watched last night the WikiLeaks documentary.
167500	169500	It's called We Steal Secrets.
169500	172500	I think it's on, I don't know if it's on the Netflixs or whatever.
172500	179500	We saw it on Apple TV because we're douches, but it's really, really enthralling.
179500	186500	I was kind of checked out during that time when the Julian Assange with the thing in the ear was happening.
186500	192500	I was getting vague reports of what was going on, and I'd see Bill Hader on SNL doing an impression.
192500	199500	I was working on Community, and I had not yet been banished to my Ecuadorian embassy.
200500	205500	But it doesn't really matter what you think of Julian Assange or what happened,
205500	212500	or if you think information should be free or cost $5 a pound, whatever the alternate view is.
212500	215500	It really is because it's such a well-done documentary.
215500	219500	It's really very objective and just kind of reports on it.
219500	220500	What is it?
220500	227500	Truly like probably one of the most interesting modern historical stories that we lived through in recent times.
228500	235500	I don't even know if a documentary about 9-11 would have more impacting kind of information in it.
235500	238500	Boy, I'm really blowing this movie.
238500	241500	Let's all go home and just watch it.
241500	243500	I just thought it was amazing.
243500	246500	The takeaway, I don't want to do any spoilers or anything.
246500	254500	One of the things that washed off the movie and kind of washed over me was just this concept
254500	259500	of we as this throng, we live in this big honeycomb, and we're all good people.
259500	261500	We're all pretty decent.
261500	266500	Then this throng is able to do these really weird, nasty things.
266500	271500	Part of the reason it's able to do nasty things is precisely because with a throng,
271500	276500	it's possible to stop communicating, to stop exchanging information freely for everyone
276500	279500	to know what's going on with everybody all the time.
279500	283500	You step over a homeless person on the way to 7-11, and you don't have time.
283500	285500	I've talked about this before.
285500	290500	What if we had an economic system where helping people was actually what made you worth more,
290500	294500	got you more laid, got you better suits and stuff.
294500	296500	Homeless people would become like targets.
296500	302500	You'd slam on your brakes and jump out of the car, throw a blanket around him trying to score something.
302500	304500	That problem would be wiped out.
304500	310500	I don't know if the country would do great or not as a result, but it's got to be better than Kickstarter.
310500	312500	I don't know what we're doing now.
312500	315500	We're just starting to all panhandle each other to death.
315500	320500	But that aside, we kind of...
320500	322500	Yeah, governments have secrets.
322500	326500	Governments have to have secrets because they have to have secrets from each other.
326500	327500	There's a plate of cookies on the table.
327500	332500	Someone's going to steal them if you don't use some counter espionage and figure out who's going to steal the cookies.
332500	333500	Who's the hungriest people?
333500	335500	Who's the cookie thief in the room?
335500	337500	It's not about protecting our cookies, man.
337500	338500	We're not dishonest people.
338500	340500	You've got to have secrets about how you get your secrets.
340500	341500	You've got to think of it.
341500	346500	Characters like Assange, they're like these kind of like...
346500	349500	You know, that hacker mentality is that information should be free.
349500	350500	It's sort of a...
350500	353500	It's not a heroic political...
353500	355500	It's not a politician's platform.
355500	358500	It's not something that's going to win you a popularity contest because it's so easy to go,
358500	361500	oh, well, if all the information's free, then this is going to happen.
361500	362500	That guy's going to fall down and hurt himself.
362500	365500	A hacker would go, who cares?
365500	366500	It's more important.
366500	370500	There's a larger crime happening when information is not free.
370500	372500	These guys...
372500	378500	What's interesting is we keep deceiving ourselves into thinking that the throng needs a hero.
378500	380500	We have this weird...
380500	381500	I guess it's not weird at all.
381500	384500	It's like we're primates, so we need a face on Time Magazine.
384500	385500	We have to know who's going to...
385500	388500	Who represents what's right to do?
388500	389500	It's this guy, right?
389500	390500	It's the man of the year.
390500	391500	It's the president.
391500	392500	Let's vote for him.
392500	393500	Let's not vote for this guy.
393500	394500	This guy knows what he's doing.
394500	395500	This guy's a rapist.
395500	397500	Yeah, but did you hear this guy invented the light bulb?
397500	401500	Yeah, but he raped someone with it.
401500	404500	Everything becomes about sniping and character assassination.
404500	406500	Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the White House.
406500	407500	Yeah, but it shouldn't be about that.
407500	412500	It should be about him tomahawk missiling the Cubans or whatever.
412500	415500	A very well-hidden secret.
415500	419500	It's one of the most effective surgical missile strikes in history.
419500	421500	Where was Bill Clinton's strike upon the Cubans?
421500	423500	Where was Julian Assange then?
423500	430500	The real Cuban Missile Crisis was Bill Clinton bombarding them while getting his dick sucked.
430500	432500	Let's not go off any tangents tonight.
432500	434500	I just want to...
434500	435500	I'm just saying, like...
435500	437500	The hallmark of Harmon Town.
437500	439500	Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George Bush.
439500	440500	We all know this.
440500	444500	It's the elephant in the room that it doesn't fucking matter that the larger things are like,
444500	446500	governments do stuff.
446500	447500	We do stuff.
447500	448500	We pay for it with our taxes.
448500	449500	It's a system.
449500	451500	Boring.
451500	452500	We don't care.
452500	453500	There's nothing there to change.
453500	457500	You can change cheering for a guy and then booing him.
457500	459500	You can elect a guy.
459500	462500	You can throw darts at his picture.
462500	464500	You can put him on the cover of the Bible.
464500	466500	You can lift him on your shoulders.
466500	467500	You can blow him.
467500	468500	You can punch him.
468500	470500	You can talk shit about him.
470500	473500	You can go, oh, he's a this or he's a that.
473500	478500	You can't do that with just the boring fact that our system works in a certain way.
479500	484500	I think that the hacker mentality is kind of like bring the whole fucking thing down.
484500	490500	Just make everything really difficult to keep secret and then we'll go from there.
490500	491500	There is no...
491500	495500	In there, if you're looking for a right or a wrong or a hero or a villain,
495500	497500	you're only going to find these weird stories.
497500	499500	Boy, those stories are really interesting.
499500	501500	I wasn't following any of it back then.
501500	505500	Maybe a lot of you were, but it sure is cool rehashed by this director
505500	508500	in a nice two hour cliff notes thing.
508500	510500	Really, really riveting.
510500	513500	Boy, I could just suck that movie's balls.
513500	518500	I just want to take that movie to another movie.
521500	523500	What movie would you take that movie to?
523500	524500	Something with Meg Ryan.
524500	526500	Is she still working?
526500	527500	I don't know.
527500	529500	I just want to make sure it gets our juices flowing
529500	532500	because afterwards I want to take that movie home.
532500	534500	Meg Ryan does it for you? She's the one?
534500	537500	I heard she does it for your date.
537500	539500	I just want to take the movie.
539500	542500	I don't remember who Meg Ryan is.
542500	543500	How was Austin?
543500	545500	Where are you, Meg Ryan?
545500	548500	Give us a call.
548500	549500	No, she's not really...
549500	551500	A couple of you looked like...
551500	553500	We've created a universe here.
553500	556500	I guess you're in LA and Robin Williams came up at one point.
556500	557500	Maybe he did some weird...
557500	561500	I honestly feel, Dan, that the last time I was in a conversation about Meg Ryan,
561500	565500	somebody showed me a picture of her knees and they were really weird.
565500	567500	Like there was a really weird knee picture of Meg Ryan.
567500	568500	Is that a segue?
568500	572500	No, it's just an interjection.
572500	575500	Austin was fine.
575500	577500	That was a segue.
577500	578500	Yeah, I had fun in Austin.
578500	579500	Did some fun panels.
579500	581500	There's a television festival there.
581500	583500	I like that television is becoming what movies used to be,
583500	587500	which is sort of a way for people to express who they are.
587500	589500	You know, you don't really have time anymore.
589500	593500	Trophallaxis, they call it when ants barf chemicals into each other's mouth.
593500	595500	You pass them.
595500	596500	Here's where I am.
596500	597500	Here's where I'm going.
597500	598500	Now you go like...
598500	600500	Arrested development.
600500	602500	You know, and the other person goes like...
602500	604500	House of cards.
604500	607500	I don't like the voiceover.
607500	610500	I don't like him looking at the camera.
610500	611500	You kind of just exchange.
611500	614500	I'll give it another shot.
614500	616500	Binge watching.
616500	618500	Subscription model.
618500	619500	No more Nielsen's.
619500	621500	Just people passing each other in the street.
621500	625500	Just barfing recommendations.
625500	626500	Game of Thrones.
626500	627500	Bro, Game of Thrones.
627500	630500	And then we all flock to Game of Thrones.
630500	635500	I was warned by my girlfriend to not get Game of Thrones spoilers.
635500	636500	Don't look at Twitter.
636500	637500	Don't look at anything.
637500	638500	Holy shit.
638500	639500	Yeah, I had 48 hours.
639500	643500	And I lived next to Paul Rust and his wife, girlfriend Leslie.
643500	645500	They're both writers on shows.
645500	647500	And they're having a Game of Thrones party.
647500	651500	And they were spoiling it just by walking past their house.
651500	652500	You could just hear me like...
652500	653500	Whoa!
653500	655500	Are you telling me?
655500	656500	I was like...
656500	657500	Walking to my car.
657500	660500	You could get spoiled walking down the road.
660500	661500	Game of Thrones.
661500	662500	It's hard to imagine.
662500	663500	How's that show going to get shitty?
663500	664500	What's it going to...
664500	665500	I don't know.
665500	666500	Everybody...
666500	667500	The last one was the one.
667500	672500	And this is a spoiler alert for people that are hearing this.
672500	674500	If you're here and haven't seen it.
674500	676500	You haven't seen it?
676500	679500	To be fair, I haven't started watching it.
679500	682500	Oh, well that's not fair.
682500	686500	I thought you were the one guy at the finale queued up at home.
686500	688500	I was like, come on, let's...
688500	689500	I won't get specific.
689500	692500	Last week's episode, people said this is a doozy.
692500	693500	And I was like, great.
693500	699500	And I was told don't look at social media if you don't want some fan people to spoil it for you.
699500	700500	And so nobody did.
700500	702500	But people kept coming up to me.
702500	705500	I watched it the day, because we do Harmon Town now on Sundays.
705500	707500	So I watched it on Monday with some friends.
707500	708500	And we got...
708500	714500	Everyone came up to me like, dude, did you watch Game of Thrones last night?
714500	715500	Yeah, I know.
715500	716500	That's what it was.
716500	717500	I was like, no, but keep it.
717500	718500	Zip it, zip it.
718500	719500	I haven't seen it.
719500	720500	I'm like, I'm not going to say anything.
720500	721500	I'm just saying.
721500	724500	Everything you're doing, your eyebrows are spoiling it right now.
724500	727500	So these guys in the drawing room, these fucking...
727500	728500	I've never met these fucking people.
728500	729500	Maybe I have.
729500	731500	It's the drawing room.
731500	732500	It's dark in the...
732500	734500	It's dark and I've been drinking.
734500	736500	They could be dear friends of mine, for all I know.
736500	740500	But these guys are like, dude, all I'm saying is I'm like, stop it?
740500	744500	And they go, just record yourself while you're watching it, man.
744500	746500	So I didn't, but I watched it.
746500	748500	And I was like, oh, it wasn't that...
748500	750500	I expected Joffrey to fuck a dragon.
750500	752500	And I didn't know what was going to go on.
752500	753500	It wasn't that good.
753500	754500	It was still good.
754500	758500	Dino has that great story when he was watching a movie with two friends.
758500	762500	And one friend didn't have time to stay for the whole movie.
762500	766500	So he wanted to know if a character was going to live or die.
766500	768500	And the other guy was like, whoa.
768500	770500	And Dino's like, whoa, I'm watching the whole movie.
770500	772500	One guy had seen the movie, Dino had not seen the movie.
772500	774500	And one guy was going to leave for work.
774500	777500	And he goes, I just want to know if he's going to live or die.
777500	779500	And Dino's like, stop it.
779500	780500	I'm watching the whole movie.
780500	783500	And the guy goes, whisper it to me, whisper it to me.
783500	786500	And the guy that's seen the movie whispers it to the middle guy.
786500	789500	And the middle guy goes, whoa, win.
789500	794500	And Dino's like, when's he going to stay alive?
794500	798500	Are you asking when he's going to stay alive?
798500	801500	Because no one does that.
801500	804500	Not dying isn't an event with a time on it.
804500	809500	You win.
809500	812500	Win.
812500	814500	Dino got so mad when we were in Chicago.
814500	816500	And all I know is New York.
816500	817500	See, I don't know.
818500	822500	There was a sign that said, we make our pizza with vodka sauce.
822500	824500	And we were like, come on.
824500	825500	And we went in.
825500	827500	And Dino just wanted to know about the vodka sauce.
827500	830500	And he was like, hey, how do you make the vodka sauce?
830500	833500	And the guy started to just make it, like we were ordering it.
833500	835500	You know, he grabbed a slice and started putting a thing.
835500	837500	And Dino's like, no, no, no, no, no.
837500	840500	I just want to know, how do you make it?
840500	841500	Is it in the sauce?
841500	842500	Or do you think?
842500	844500	And he goes, it's a spicy.
844500	847500	And Dino's like, let's get out of here.
847500	852500	And as we were walking out, he went, it's a spicy.
852500	855500	It's really bad.
855500	856500	All right.
856500	858500	So we're going to do a new segment tonight.
861500	866500	It's called Unenjoyable Things.
866500	867500	I think you'll love it.
868500	870500	I don't even know why I'm pulling.
870500	871500	Do you want a theme song for this?
871500	872500	Yeah.
872500	873500	Yeah.
873500	874500	Can you give me something like a quick burst?
874500	877500	This is just a list kind of off the top of my head, I think.
877500	879500	What's the name of the segment?
879500	886500	This is called Try Not To Do This In Your Sample Script.
886500	890500	This is called Try Not To Do This In Your Sample Script.
903500	906500	That was better than any of us imagined.
906500	907500	All right.
907500	908500	Voiceover.
908500	909500	Just stop it.
909500	910500	Just stop it.
910500	913500	If you want to work in television, I know.
913500	914500	I know.
914500	915500	I know.
915500	919500	Stop watching television shows and going, oh, that's how you write television.
919500	921500	I will continue to read your script.
921500	927500	I'm not going to throw it across the room because I'm not going to be racist against your voiceover script.
927500	931500	But I'm not going to judge it because of the thing.
931500	932500	But I am.
932500	934500	I'm going to judge you because what are you doing?
934500	938500	If it says on page one, you know who you are.
938500	940500	It says, Stan, V-O.
940500	942500	And then it goes, that's me.
943500	946500	What a nerd.
946500	950500	I'm the guy that never knows what to do until he's doing it.
950500	955500	I think I can pick that up from stuff happening in your script.
955500	957500	What are you fucking doing?
957500	958500	What are you doing?
958500	960500	Stop jabbing me in the ribs.
960500	968500	If you have more information than you can possibly squeeze into the medium of television,
969500	975500	if you need to do something with purpose where it's like, oh, this looks like this is what's happening,
975500	978500	but really, this is what's happening.
978500	982500	You've got a lot to prove when you do that.
982500	984500	Really think about what you're doing there.
984500	987500	Fade in on a guy eating a sandwich.
987500	991500	There I am, the sandwich-eating guy.
991500	993500	You know what they say about a sandwich.
993500	996500	It's two pieces of bread with some meat in the middle.
996500	998500	And that's how I feel about life.
1001500	1002500	This sounds pretty good.
1002500	1007500	If that's how you feel about life, Mr. Author,
1008500	1014500	write a script called Sandwich and fade in on some turkey.
1018500	1021500	That's the point of writing.
1021500	1025500	You're supposed to make yourself clear in that medium.
1025500	1031500	If you want to make yourself clear by showing me something and talking to me during it,
1031500	1033500	be Laurie Anderson.
1033500	1035500	Do performance art.
1035500	1037500	Go to a fucking art show.
1037500	1043500	Have friends over and show up sly to your fucking vacation.
1043500	1046500	That's me outside the Coliseum.
1048500	1050500	I'm gay.
1051500	1054500	I've always thought the Coliseum was like being gay.
1054500	1056500	It's round.
1057500	1061500	There I am, pretending to hold up the bleeding tower.
1061500	1063500	What's with me?
1063500	1065500	I can't get a break.
1067500	1072500	If you write a TV show, just fade in on a guy doing something.
1072500	1075500	Let me figure it out, you fucking dick.
1081500	1093500	I think the music's really helping this bit.
1093500	1095500	I can't remember.
1095500	1099500	Please have three more so I can keep playing that song.
1099500	1103500	I've been reading a lot of scripts.
1103500	1107500	Characters are not lists of things.
1108500	1114500	Just because a guy likes Coldplay and is wearing Axe Body Spray doesn't make him a character.
1114500	1118500	If you hate him so much, just have him get hit by a truck or something.
1118500	1120500	I don't know.
1120500	1122500	That one's harder to describe.
1122500	1128500	Especially when you have the two characters that have each compatible list of things.
1128500	1130500	Then one guy goes, I like E.T.
1130500	1132500	She's like, I like E.T.
1132500	1136500	I pooped in my pants when I was at E.T.
1136500	1140500	She's like, wait, you just said you pooped in your pants when you were at E.T.
1140500	1144500	I eat in my teas when I watch poop tea.
1144500	1147500	Cut to the coffee shop.
1147500	1150500	Things are going well.
1154500	1159500	I'm getting the impression I haven't warned you off of this crime sufficiently.
1160500	1163500	Dan, if you ever feel like you're flailing in this certain segment,
1163500	1166500	you can just point to me and the music comes right back in.
1166500	1171500	I just want to tell you that characters are, to a certain extent,
1171500	1174500	yes, when you're describing your friend, you may tell me a couple details
1174500	1177500	about the things that he wears or consumes.
1177500	1182500	I just also think you should maybe know him as a person.
1190500	1194500	I don't write scripts, but as a person that gets to read a lot of scripts,
1194500	1197500	mostly half-hour comedy kind of things, if you're a writer
1197500	1201500	and you're making a half-hour comedy right now, don't put Man Cave in it.
1210500	1212500	Let's build on that one, though.
1212500	1214500	Here's the thing.
1214500	1216500	Here's another thing that you can't do.
1216500	1219500	And this is a little harder for a lot of you.
1219500	1224500	You also, in addition to that, you can't have one character say,
1224500	1228500	and this is my Man Cave, and then have the other character say,
1228500	1232500	rule number one, don't say Man Cave.
1238500	1241500	Because that doesn't count also as a joke.
1241500	1243500	Also, another thing, especially in comedies,
1244500	1249500	you're writing a script, and somebody will say something that is nonsensical.
1249500	1253500	Someone will go, yeah, time to get the giver babbles.
1253500	1257500	And then someone else will go, what does that even mean?
1257500	1259500	In every fucking script you read.
1259500	1261500	That's the time for the voiceover.
1261500	1263500	You come in, tell me what you're doing.
1263500	1267500	What I mean by that is, yeah, exactly.
1267500	1269500	That's the thing.
1269500	1272500	Too many jokes being presented.
1272500	1275500	One guy saying something that doesn't make any sense,
1275500	1277500	and the other guy saying that does not make any sense, Gerald.
1277500	1279500	Is that like a Monopoly guy? Is that close to the line?
1279500	1280500	It's pretty close to a Monopoly guy.
1280500	1282500	Have we explained Monopoly guy here before?
1282500	1284500	Maybe a long time ago.
1284500	1286500	Rob Schrabbe and I, you started to adapt it in shorthand,
1286500	1289500	the phrase Monopoly guy to use in writing,
1289500	1291500	when you kind of set yourself up.
1291500	1294500	Now, all writing is essentially a Monopoly guy.
1294500	1296500	This is not an empirically measurable thing,
1296500	1300500	like the way something either has sugar in it or doesn't.
1300500	1303500	Everything is a little bit of a Monopoly guy,
1303500	1306500	but I think there's a certain point where it's unnecessary roughness.
1306500	1309500	The reason, it's called a Monopoly guy.
1309500	1312500	I think that's the...
1312500	1316500	Rob Schrabbe, as young aspiring writers,
1316500	1320500	were watching Ace Ventura 2 as you do.
1320500	1322500	Just to hone those chops.
1322500	1325500	And there's a scene in it where there's a guy that walks into a party,
1325500	1328500	and he's wearing a top hat and a monocle,
1328500	1333500	and he has a big white curly mustache and a tail tuxedo,
1333500	1335500	and he's about four feet tall.
1335500	1339500	And as most rich people would at a party,
1339500	1343500	he's got some problems with Ace's behavior.
1343500	1346500	Ace is a very freewheeling character.
1346500	1348500	He plays it as it lays.
1348500	1351500	I think he had just emerged from a bathroom,
1351500	1353500	and he's very wet because he had had a whole adventure,
1353500	1355500	and then he just said,
1355500	1358500	I just took a huge shit in there and stuff.
1358500	1362500	And then this guy, this little guy who, again,
1362500	1364500	just to describe him for you,
1364500	1368500	just to give you the same breakdown that the wardrobe department got
1368500	1371500	in central casting, he's got a white mustache,
1371500	1375500	a monocle, and a top hat and a tuxedo with tails on it.
1375500	1377500	And short, kind of short.
1377500	1380500	Kind of short, kind of cartoonish looking.
1380500	1383500	I think he was holding two big bags of money with dollar signs on them,
1383500	1385500	I can't remember.
1385500	1388500	But he expressed some problems with Ace's behavior then.
1388500	1391500	And then as the punchline did the whole thing,
1391500	1393500	like Ace Ventura went,
1393500	1396500	Hello, I am Ace Ventura.
1396500	1398500	I'm pleased to meet you.
1398500	1403500	Let me guess, you're the Monopoly guy.
1403500	1405500	And then held for applause because you're supposed to be like,
1405500	1409500	Holy shit, he nailed it.
1409500	1412500	There's that guy walking around that movie set
1412500	1415500	dressed like the Monopoly guy, thinks he can get away with it.
1415500	1419500	Not according to the other guy that's also in the same movie,
1419500	1421500	written by the same person,
1421500	1425500	who handed a memo to the lady that bought a tux,
1425500	1427500	went to the wardrobe warehouse and said,
1427500	1432500	Do you have something a Monopoly guy would wear?
1432500	1435500	And then the guy sat down, how can we do your mustache?
1435500	1438500	And they held up a Monopoly guy card.
1438500	1442500	It said, do it like that, do the card, do it like on the card.
1442500	1445500	That counts as a joke if the guy is just on the street,
1445500	1447500	then you're a badass.
1447500	1449500	That's when you don't want to say, how do you like them apples?
1449500	1452500	You want to call the guy a Monopoly guy.
1452500	1454500	I don't know, I guess you guys are bummed out
1454500	1456500	because you know all your scripts are shitty.
1456500	1466500	Do, do, do, do.
1466500	1469500	Yeah, just be better at what you do.
1469500	1471500	You'll get the hang of it.
1471500	1474500	Are you saying that because you're looking for writers,
1474500	1476500	for your staff, for community that you've been reading some turkeys?
1476500	1479500	No, I mean you have to, you have to read everything.
1479500	1482500	If I was in there, if I was trying to get work,
1482500	1484500	mine would be one of the turkeys
1484500	1486500	because you're always in a different mood when you're reading everything.
1486500	1491500	I'm not, I don't want to get presumptuous about it.
1491500	1495500	A war needs soldiers and in assembling a good staff,
1495500	1500500	you need people to throw their butt at you on a platter
1500500	1502500	and you get to appraise it however you want.
1502500	1505500	Boy, I'm really burping it up tonight.
1505500	1508500	So I'm not saying, you're not a bad person.
1508500	1511500	Your job is to write 20 million bad scripts in your lifetime
1511500	1513500	and then you get lucky with some of them.
1513500	1516500	But I just think, in the meantime, could you please, with the voiceover,
1516500	1517500	it's really killing me.
1517500	1518500	There's so many scripts.
1518500	1520500	Like, hey, I'm Steve.
1520500	1523500	If you're thinking what I'm thinking, keep reading.
1523500	1528500	It's amazing.
1528500	1530500	I know that there are shows on the air that do this,
1530500	1534500	but I don't, you know, those are just people that got lucky too.
1534500	1536500	Your job is to be better.
1536500	1538500	These are sample pilots?
1538500	1539500	Because pilots are hard.
1539500	1541500	Yeah, they're like specs, like original material.
1541500	1543500	You have to get some of shit done on a pilot.
1543500	1546500	It's hard to keep action going, also saying who everybody is
1546500	1548500	and what they want and what they don't want.
1548500	1550500	Voiceover is kind of a bailout, isn't it?
1550500	1551500	Yeah, it is.
1551500	1555500	Especially if somebody walks in the room and goes,
1555500	1556500	hey, who farted?
1556500	1559500	And then the protagonist goes, not me.
1559500	1563500	And then it frees frames and the voiceover goes, I did fart.
1563500	1564500	I did.
1564500	1565500	I farted.
1565500	1567500	That's a little bit of a...
1567500	1570500	That's called the wonder years, I think.
1571500	1574500	It's, you know, you've got to ask yourself
1574500	1576500	if you're practicing any craft at all.
1576500	1579500	I mean, if you're just like, there I am.
1579500	1580500	There's me.
1580500	1582500	I'm God, spinning the planet on my finger.
1582500	1584500	You know, sometimes being God gets boring,
1584500	1587500	so I write a pilot and just fuck around.
1587500	1589500	There's my flamingo.
1589500	1591500	Why'd I make his knees backwards?
1591500	1593500	I don't know.
1595500	1597500	There's Molly and Kate.
1597500	1599500	They're the best friends.
1599500	1601500	You know, Molly's the kind of friend that always says
1601500	1603500	she doesn't want to go shoe shopping,
1603500	1604500	but then she does.
1604500	1605500	Let's go shoe shopping.
1605500	1606500	Not a joke.
1606500	1607500	That's not a joke.
1607500	1609500	Just because God said she wouldn't say it.
1609500	1610500	All right.
1610500	1612500	Kate's not about to fart.
1618500	1621500	Just get down there with the people and just, you know,
1621500	1622500	make love to them.
1622500	1623500	Is your staff coming together?
1623500	1625500	Have you found people that you like?
1625500	1626500	Yeah, yeah.
1626500	1628500	There's a million amazing people out there.
1628500	1633500	It's just a question of finding them, you know?
1633500	1635500	It's going to be fine.
1635500	1637500	It's going to be fine.
1637500	1639500	What if it's not fine?
1639500	1640500	No, it will be fine.
1640500	1641500	No, I have a...
1641500	1643500	What if you are the...
1643500	1646500	Who else as an executive producer has been fired
1646500	1647500	and rehired?
1647500	1648500	Loren Michaels?
1648500	1649500	You?
1649500	1650500	I think...
1650500	1651500	Do you count Moses?
1651500	1653500	Wasn't he kind of...
1653500	1655500	No, I do not count Moses.
1655500	1657500	He was all about voiceover.
1658500	1659500	That's true.
1659500	1662500	The bush was like, hi, I'm a bush.
1665500	1667500	If you're thinking right now, you should hate your neighbor.
1667500	1669500	I don't think so.
1672500	1676500	Anyways, that's enough of that.
1676500	1678500	Erin's at home taking care of the puppy.
1678500	1680500	That's a bummer that she can't be here.
1680500	1681500	Puppies are a full-time job.
1681500	1683500	We don't want to talk about puppy care.
1683500	1686500	But I do want to tell you that it turns out a dog
1686500	1689500	is not capable of knowing where to pee or poop
1689500	1691500	for the first seven months of its life.
1691500	1695500	So you have to be told that by someone after a few weeks
1695500	1698500	of going like, what are we doing wrong?
1698500	1700500	Why will it just pee anywhere?
1700500	1705500	Their brains aren't even ready to receive the puppy training.
1705500	1707500	Is it just pissing and shit and everywhere?
1707500	1710500	I mean, it's like you just have to...
1710500	1713500	Dogs just won't pee where they sleep.
1713500	1715500	So that's what crate training is.
1715500	1717500	It makes you feel like a terrible parent
1717500	1721500	because every two hours you take the dog out,
1721500	1723500	you play with it, you do all this stuff with it.
1723500	1726500	But then at the end of it, you can't let them wander your house
1726500	1729500	like an adorable puppy because it'll just piss anywhere.
1729500	1731500	There's nothing you can really do,
1731500	1737500	but let it sleep and rest in this little puppy-sized crate.
1737500	1740500	It's a little pen, which it'll associate as being like,
1740500	1742500	it's home, it's den, it's bed.
1742500	1746500	And so it only knows, I can't pee here, I can't poop here.
1746500	1751500	So then you take it out, you take it out in the yard
1751500	1753500	and it immediately pisses because it's got to pee
1753500	1756500	because it's been in there since the last time it peed.
1756500	1758500	And then you're like, yeah, it's great, it's great, it's great.
1758500	1762500	If you slip up for a second, then things are going to pee anywhere.
1762500	1766500	And puppies also, they don't lift their leg, they just stand
1766500	1768500	and they strike this kind of like,
1768500	1770500	George Washington crossing the Delaware,
1770500	1775500	they thrust their chest out and kind of look kind of regal for a second
1775500	1777500	and then there's just a puddle beneath them.
1777500	1779500	That's how I do it.
1783500	1785500	It's a full-time job.
1785500	1789500	If you've seen me in a public restroom, you'll notice the regal pose I strike.
1789500	1791500	You put your foot up on the seat.
1791500	1794500	I actually bring a mock-up of a hull of a boat
1794500	1798500	and I put one leg up on the four planks.
1798500	1800500	I'm sorry I said you guys are bad writers.
1800500	1802500	I didn't.
1802500	1804500	I feel like our relationship changed.
1804500	1806500	Is there anybody in here right now that has a current script
1806500	1810500	in the works that has voiceover and feels like a piece of garbage right now?
1812500	1813500	It's not a comedy script.
1813500	1814500	It's not a comedy script.
1814500	1816500	Okay, see, that's good, that's good.
1816500	1817500	That's a start.
1817500	1818500	It's a drama?
1818500	1819500	One Hour?
1819500	1821500	Like a genre thing or procedural?
1821500	1824500	It's like Taxi Driver in High School.
1824500	1826500	Taxi Driver in High School?
1826500	1827500	That sounds good.
1827500	1831500	Hey, are you talking to me or am I talking to myself?
1831500	1833500	I don't know, but we're going to find out.
1833500	1835500	That's me, Trevor Bickle.
1835500	1838500	Voted most likely to kill everybody.
1839500	1842500	I'm going to kill the high school class president.
1842500	1847500	That doesn't seem like a safe territory.
1848500	1851500	You know, the taxi driver is happening in high schools across America
1851500	1853500	on a weekly basis these days.
1853500	1855500	He's got his finger on the pulse for him.
1855500	1856500	All right, all right, I like it.
1856500	1859500	He minds putting his finger on the pulse.
1859500	1861500	Scratch my throat.
1861500	1864500	Remember the bit I did when I was yelling and screaming?
1864500	1866500	I got so angry about voiceover.
1866500	1867500	You want a burpin? You want a Tums?
1867500	1868500	You okay?
1868500	1871500	It's mostly just scratchy throat because I yelled.
1871500	1874500	I thought it was Sam Kinison for a second and I paid the price.
1874500	1875500	That's me.
1875500	1877500	I'm Dan Harmon.
1877500	1879500	I used to think screaming was a good idea.
1879500	1880500	Then I paid the price.
1880500	1882500	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1882500	1885500	The other thing that I'm kind of iffy about is the flashback thing,
1885500	1888500	the 30 Rock thing, the swish wipe to the thing.
1888500	1891500	I mean, it's like, you know, I didn't really do that a lot in community
1891500	1894500	because I felt like that had been kind of tread over.
1896500	1897500	So, I don't know.
1897500	1899500	But you make up your own mind about that, really.
1899500	1902500	I mean, when I'm reading your script, I'm looking for like,
1902500	1905500	I'm looking for any kind of like, I don't really care.
1905500	1906500	You know, you can make a mistake.
1906500	1907500	I don't care.
1907500	1910500	Like, everyone does something that someone else doesn't like.
1910500	1912500	You can't, you'd have to be a rock or a corpse
1912500	1915500	to not offend somebody with your script.
1916500	1918500	Dan, I'm worried about you right now.
1918500	1920500	I scratched, blew up my throat yelling.
1920500	1922500	Can't do it anymore. There's a bit.
1922500	1924500	There is water behind you.
1924500	1925500	Next to the vodka.
1925500	1927500	He's never seen the water, by the way.
1927500	1929500	Right.
1930500	1933500	That water might as well have camouflage on it.
1937500	1938500	Is it really that easy?
1938500	1940500	You just make your throat wet and then it stops.
1942500	1945500	It felt more severe than just like, I needed, it needed to be hydrated.
1945500	1947500	You want to irrigate the system there, baby.
1949500	1950500	It also makes me feel kind of legit.
1950500	1953500	I never thought about just drinking water in the middle of saying something.
1953500	1955500	I keep going, so anyways, that's marriage.
1960500	1966500	Trips to the dentists are never what they seem.
1967500	1970500	I've been listening to a lot of comedy, like stand up stuff on satellite radio
1970500	1973500	and there's like those four or five stations that you kind of go through
1973500	1974500	and there's the blue collar one.
1974500	1976500	It's always someone talking about their porch.
1976500	1978500	That's like the worst in that.
1978500	1981500	But there's comments that I've loved when you see them,
1981500	1984500	but when you hear them, you hear the verbal tick that they do.
1985500	1988500	So punchline, um, but they do it every time.
1988500	1991500	Like the comics that I really like, you're like, oh, you're, you have that tick.
1991500	1995500	That's a weird like, uh, like go-to thingy to do.
1995500	1996500	It makes me kind of not like them as much.
1996500	1997500	You know who doesn't have that?
1997500	1998500	Richard Pryor.
1998500	1999500	No, he does.
1999500	2000500	Richard Pryor.
2000500	2002500	He has that kind of nervous chuckle to him.
2002500	2003500	It's like when you see him, you don't care.
2003500	2006500	When you just hear it, it's, uh, it's jarring.
2008500	2010500	I'm not, I'm not being quiet because I'm hanging out to dry.
2010500	2012500	I'm just like watering my throat.
2014500	2016500	You did the thing when, uh, when you run out of steam or something,
2016500	2018500	like you go, yeah, sometimes.
2018500	2019500	Yeah.
2019500	2020500	Yeah.
2021500	2024500	Or I'll go, I notice I'll go like, what, what, like after you talk,
2024500	2027500	I'll go, but sometimes it sounds like I'm being a dick.
2027500	2029500	First you recover from gales of laughter.
2029500	2032500	You'll say something and then, and then I'll go, all right.
2034500	2036500	Like if somebody, if I'm listening to someone else, I go, all right.
2036500	2037500	Yeah.
2037500	2038500	And it's like, well, what is it?
2038500	2039500	What am I?
2040500	2041500	Dick Cavett.
2041500	2042500	Yeah.
2042500	2043500	Chelsea.
2043500	2044500	Chelsea.
2044500	2045500	What's her name?
2046500	2049500	I clearly like my throat is blown out and I've run out of steam and it's a good
2049500	2053500	time to bring up some of our friends so that they can pick up the, uh, the,
2053500	2054500	the slack.
2054500	2057500	Dan was, uh, it's texted me before the show and said he might be very late.
2057500	2060500	And so Camille was backstage and we said, I said, maybe you should just go out
2060500	2061500	and do an opener.
2061500	2063500	And he was like, I'd do that.
2063500	2064500	And, uh, maybe we'll do that one time.
2064500	2067500	We'll just have a proper, just like a, like a, like a good proper.
2067500	2068500	I'll just keep pushing the late envelope.
2068500	2069500	Yeah.
2069500	2070500	And if I'm ever like 10 minutes, yeah.
2070500	2072500	Like, like, yeah, I should have somebody come on.
2072500	2073500	Let's bring him in.
2073500	2074500	Let's bring Camille Nanjiani up.
2084500	2088500	Can I say one thing about that Goodwill hunting scene?
2088500	2089500	The apples thing.
2089500	2090500	You could say like a million things.
2090500	2091500	Well, okay.
2091500	2093500	That's, I honestly, that's a movie.
2093500	2095500	I really liked the first time I saw it and now I don't like it.
2096500	2098500	Uh, by the way, you stopped licking them apples.
2101500	2102500	As much.
2102500	2105500	By the way, you drinking water looks so unnatural to me.
2105500	2106500	I can feel it.
2106500	2107500	It's like tasteless vodka to you.
2107500	2108500	Melting me.
2108500	2109500	Yeah.
2109500	2110500	Well, okay.
2110500	2114500	So the apple scene, first of all, that fucking guy, why did he respond?
2114500	2117500	He's like, this guy just showed me up, stole my girlfriend.
2117500	2119500	Now he wants to know if I like apples.
2119500	2122500	Well, I should probably answer in the affirmative.
2122500	2123500	That's stupid.
2123500	2126500	Also, what if he didn't like apples?
2126500	2128500	Then does he have like other backup?
2128500	2129500	Okay.
2129500	2130500	You don't like apples.
2130500	2131500	Um, uh, do you like chicken wings?
2132500	2134500	Well, then what do you wing of this?
2134500	2136500	You know, I don't know.
2136500	2138500	I mean, I, I have been over this.
2138500	2140500	I, I, I get that scene.
2140500	2141500	Yeah.
2141500	2142500	Yeah.
2142500	2143500	Oh yeah.
2143500	2144500	Is it true?
2144500	2145500	Especially that guy and what he's thinking.
2145500	2146500	Is it true?
2146500	2149500	The original script that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon purportedly wrote was
2149500	2151500	about them saving the world from a meteor.
2151500	2153500	It was kind of like a spy thriller.
2153500	2158500	I think like, like, Matt Damon was a super smart, like, like guy as he is in
2158500	2159500	the movie.
2159500	2160500	I think that's where the similarities.
2160500	2161500	He could kick ass.
2161500	2162500	Fuck any chick.
2162500	2164500	He was super smart and there was a meteor coming.
2164500	2166500	But was he still like a janitor?
2166500	2170500	In a way, knowing what we know about you and being able to tell the future,
2170500	2173500	you're kind of like Goodwill hunting in janitor mode.
2173500	2174500	Yeah.
2174500	2175500	You really are.
2175500	2176500	You're not using it.
2176500	2179500	Your life is the first act of a superhero movie.
2179500	2181500	Camille, I had a dream about you last night.
2181500	2182500	No.
2182500	2184500	Did you guys listen to last week's episode?
2184500	2185500	We are here.
2187500	2189500	You think you're everyone?
2189500	2190500	Yes.
2191500	2193500	But wait.
2193500	2195500	Backtrack for two iterations.
2195500	2197500	No, the original script for that.
2197500	2198500	Oh, yeah.
2198500	2200500	Well, as I understand it, I have not Googled it.
2200500	2203500	I don't know that there was a they wrote it.
2203500	2207500	They had this this script that was like it was kind of like I think it was
2207500	2213500	like closer to like a kind of born identity kind of like thing.
2213500	2215500	Like it was like a spy thriller.
2215500	2220500	And then William Goldman, I believe, did an uncredited rewrite on it and made
2220500	2223500	it into a feel good therapy thriller.
2226500	2228500	But that type it into Snopes.
2228500	2229500	I don't know.
2229500	2233500	Maybe I don't know how much is anybody know the details on that original script.
2233500	2236500	I think I remember hearing that it was like it was like Armageddon.
2236500	2239500	Like they actually had to figure out how to stop the world from being hit by
2239500	2242500	either janitor by a near earth asteroid or something like that.
2242500	2243500	Is it still that he's a janitor?
2244500	2245500	I don't know.
2245500	2248500	But it was like it was a script that you write if you're a twelve year old like
2248500	2250500	I fuck everybody and I kick a lot of ass.
2250500	2253500	And then a few years of coming to fucking save the world.
2253500	2257500	It's funny that their lives did kind of actually turn like that.
2257500	2258500	That's the life.
2258500	2260500	And he was born.
2260500	2262500	He got to be Jason Bourne.
2262500	2263500	Yeah.
2263500	2264500	Yeah.
2264500	2268500	And when they accepted the the Academy Award for best screenplay.
2268500	2269500	Yeah.
2269500	2271500	I think had been a near page one rewrite by somebody else.
2271500	2272500	Right.
2272500	2274500	That's what Matt Damon seemed to be a little contrite.
2274500	2275500	Little like hey.
2276500	2277500	This is my name.
2277500	2278500	I'll take it with.
2278500	2279500	Thank you.
2279500	2280500	And I'll get out of here.
2280500	2282500	But Ben Affleck was Boo Yaya and high five.
2283500	2284500	I think he did a cartwheel.
2285500	2286500	You didn't write that thing yet.
2290500	2292500	Did you ever see how is your news.
2293500	2298500	The documentary about the it's the mentally challenged people that I know
2298500	2299500	about it.
2299500	2301500	But I think they do.
2301500	2303500	They do news correspondents.
2303500	2306500	It's sort of like a self funded thing with their caretakers.
2306500	2307500	They wanted to do it.
2307500	2308500	And they kind of I don't know.
2308500	2310500	They put this project together and they went out there to it.
2312500	2319500	It's it's just down syndrome guy who's like talking to Ben Affleck about it.
2319500	2324500	But an athlete is so he keeps asking him questions about Daredevil or something
2324500	2329500	and Ben Affleck is so in actor talking politics mode.
2329500	2332500	He's so supercharged about how bad the Republicans are and stuff.
2333500	2336500	He comes the closest to being a little bit of a dick to a retarded guy.
2337500	2340500	He's kind of like he kind of doesn't notice the guy's retarded and is like kind of
2340500	2341500	he doesn't.
2341500	2342500	Well I know.
2342500	2343500	But he does.
2343500	2344500	But I'm just saying.
2344500	2345500	Daredevil is blind.
2345500	2346500	Yeah.
2348500	2349500	He does.
2349500	2352500	Everybody else is like really heartwarming because these people are doing what they want.
2352500	2357500	It's like we're so used to like it really cuts to the to the quick of this this weird
2357500	2362500	ironic swirl that we have surrounding people who are differently abled where we we think
2362500	2366500	that sensitivity is treating them like ghosts because when they walk into a room we don't
2366500	2370500	want them to be the way they are which is a horrible thing to feel about another human
2370500	2371500	being.
2371500	2373500	So we pretend we don't feel that way because we don't want to engage.
2373500	2378500	Meanwhile the people who wipe their asses and and pick them up and carry them into the
2378500	2382500	water if they've never experienced being in water before the people who wipe wipe drool
2382500	2386500	off their face who stay with them to keep them from swallowing so much air that their
2386500	2390500	stomachs explode depending on how what they've gotten how bad they got it like people who
2390500	2395500	people who engage with them and don't have that kind of shame and guilt like they're they're
2395500	2399500	kind of delighted by people like for instance with Down syndrome are typically very funny
2399500	2404500	people like they're there they make you laugh and I think we all feel like very when we
2404500	2409500	feel that laughter coming up when a person with Down syndrome like like like says something
2409500	2415500	and is entertaining like like we kind of like we have this weird reaction and and and but
2415500	2418500	but the how's your news is uplifting because they go around it's like I don't know it's
2418500	2422500	just like like like you know you go to they're going across the country and like there there
2422500	2426500	isn't anybody that's going what's wrong with you what's your problem what are you retarded
2426500	2431500	like like everyone kind of very quickly adapts and has a delightful conversation or that's
2431500	2435500	though those are the ones that didn't make it into the documentary or people are just
2435500	2440500	like wait are you retarded like cut let's go to the next guy I'm sure there was some
2440500	2445500	uncharismatic moments but and and they but but I'm sure if there was a big one they probably
2445500	2449500	would have put it in to have for the sake of like full like kind of like give you the
2449500	2454500	full picture uh but anyways but then I have like kind of and it's not because he's a bad
2454500	2457500	person like it's not like he doesn't like the retarded like I just remembered watching
2457500	2461500	it going like I don't think I don't think he's paying attention like he he's just annoyed
2461500	2467500	that the guy won't stop asking him about Daredevil he wants to talk about politics and speaking
2467500	2472500	of what you were saying my wife's mom who's like a wonderful person southern lady whenever
2472500	2476500	she sees somebody who has like down syndrome or somebody's in a wheelchair she always goes
2476500	2483500	so beautiful she says it every single time and and she's like so like she thinks it's
2484500	2489500	like a good thing she's like oh so pitiful but like pretty loud one time she went up
2489500	2493500	to a couple two guys were holding hands and she was like I think that's great and just
2493500	2500500	walked away seal of approval from a stranger yeah thanks lady I mean I guess I guess pitiful
2500500	2506500	and pathetic of the the meanings of those words have changed to pejorative words punitive
2506500	2511500	words you're pathetic you're you're pitiful like wait pitiful just meaning like you're
2511500	2516500	you know something to be pitied I guess it's not politically correct you know but but
2516500	2522500	but just saying pitiful is not correct I don't think in any way I don't think it's just
2522500	2526500	saying I pity you so pitiful well what if she said so tragic I mean that's the thing
2526500	2529500	that's where it runs up against this thing where you're supposed to not you're not supposed
2529500	2536500	to feel sorry you're not supposed to regard the differently abled as being lesser than
2537500	2544500	yourself are they well I mean if a person has one arm they have one less arm than the
2545500	2550500	average person and they're pretty capable of going like like yeah well I got the one
2550500	2554500	arm so they don't they don't have to let it hold them back you're not supposed to not
2554500	2559500	give them a job because they have less arms they can still go to the Olympics or like
2559500	2563500	as I found out on this stage like some people are can get indicted for murder and have like
2563500	2568500	cyborg limbs there's people with different numbers of things doing all kinds of stuff
2568500	2572500	when it's a purely physical thing like that when you're like I got I got one leg and I'm
2572500	2575500	gonna I'm gonna jump over the moon it's like it's very easy for us to compartmentalize
2575500	2579500	and stuff and then you have like well what if you're bipolar what if you're transgender
2579500	2583500	but you're like you know you identify as a different different different gender than
2583500	2587500	you are what if you're a kleptomaniac what if you're what if you're just clinically
2587500	2592500	depressed what if you have down syndrome like like you you it's harder for us to process
2592500	2597500	that that that that information and come out the other side like just kind of rooting for
2597500	2604500	everybody we used to go oh everyone different is worse off here's you know we call it we
2604500	2609500	just call them worse off and let's collect some money and it's kind of like in so many
2609500	2614500	ways we've advanced in our thinking but in some very strange ways we've kind of along
2614500	2622500	the way got a little little tangled in our in our own shoelaces haven't we play that
2622500	2633500	cowboy song hey gang Adam Goldberg has come to the stage and I'm not going to connect
2633500	2640000	any dots with what we've been discussing I'm going I've discussed on the I have a family
2640000	2645500	history of muscular dystrophy got you to stop laughing with that one I don't think
2645500	2653000	that's the problem for you Adam getting people to stick darn you come out you quick Adam
2653000	2658000	welcome to the stage yeah hey Adam come on up here now edit it so it looks like we invited
2658000	2668500	him I thought hey Adam what do you have to say come on up buddy I like who males idea
2668500	2674500	that this podcast is still edited by people other than I'll be the devil's advocate and
2674500	2681500	say Adam Adam by definition has become the uninvited you know yeah which was a horror
2681500	2685500	movie so he had kind of a hit a good stint I was listening to the car on the way here
2685500	2691500	he good he made forward steps last week yeah well yeah and in physical therapy yes no no
2691500	2697500	and and coming up on ash and leaving on applause it was good I guess sorry what would you say
2697500	2703500	no my muscular dystrophy yeah so my dad's in a wheelchair at the like 90% of the time pitiful
2703500	2711500	it should it be like 85 or should it be like 93 because we get we can get to vote on it
2711500	2718500	no I'm saying I'll go with zero all right I'm pulling in that direction but I did the
2718500	2725500	thing is there's this other medium that we see people who are like who have Olympic stature
2725500	2733500	and have a disability and we see them as like this ur example of super crips which is an
2733500	2741500	actual term in discussing the disabled it's super crips not like the super bloods no and
2741500	2746500	we think that oh since not every person is going to be an Olympic runner despite losing
2746500	2750500	their legs we look at normal people who lose their legs and say well why aren't you this
2750500	2755500	guy why aren't you held to this standard of being a super Olympian who wants it the most
2755500	2764500	now the super bloods they're doing was kryptonite right yeah don't boo I loved it I love that
2764500	2771500	one Jack play it let's play it to your own punch line all right so I like what you're
2771500	2778500	circling keep keep keep going baby so in Iron Man 3 there was one of the huge I'm trying to play
2778500	2785500	to you guys we're in a comic book shop in Iron Man 3 the extremist virus was about a disability
2785500	2789500	it was about people came back from war and when we finally hear one of these people speak
2789500	2794500	when he's in the newsman said when did what was the most important day of your life person
2794500	2799500	in the extremist program and the person responded the day I decided my disability wasn't going
2799500	2805500	to hold me back now there's not one person in this movie who gets extremists who we meet
2805500	2810500	who isn't evil Pepper Potts has already been established as a good character who gets extremists
2810500	2817500	but one by and by large these people are and you should have like statistically they've seen
2817500	2822500	it it's the second biggest movie of all time yeah he's just these box office challenged my
2822500	2827500	chair I can spoil movies all right continue I think it's fun is that one of the benefits
2827500	2835500	you get the thing you can park your car anywhere you can spoil movies I'm benefiting from the
2835500	2838500	fact that I have no idea what you're talking about I'm gonna benefit from whatever Adams
2838500	2843500	point is before I benefit from Iron Man 3 that's for sure I know that go ahead and so we
2843500	2850500	get this guy and he's it's the implicit thing is that all these people wanted you know that
2850500	2855500	they were ruined and that the only way to get better is through drugs except that the hero
2855500	2860500	of the movie just decides to use willpower to get over everything from PTSD to not having
2860500	2866500	his super powered armor so we kind of see the extremist thugs as taking the easy way out
2866500	2870500	they're the villains of the movie they're destroyed by his old armor which he blows up
2870500	2876500	because the movie's about becoming whole and getting rid of his ability through willpower
2876500	2884500	so much as we decided at some point in the 80s or 70s that you know parents should should both
2884500	2889500	go to work like like like you know mom can work and dad can work and you know kids can like
2889500	2892500	have a house key around their neck and they can come home from school and eat some instant
2892500	2897500	oatmeal and because you know capitalism gets what it wants are you saying that the like
2897500	2904500	we're kind of the wrong energy gets behind this concept of a good handicap person a heroic
2904500	2912500	handicap person is a person that just works way harder the cases are such that most handicap
2912500	2917500	people can't do that any more than you could grow a third arm by warning it the most or not
2917500	2922500	having anywhere to hold your coffee or something of course well I've yeah I've been unable to
2922500	2927500	write for two months because women have rejected me I don't know what I do if I lost a foot I
2927500	2933500	don't know I think I think I'd cash it in voiceover that would be your crutch if you lost a foot
2933500	2938500	hey that's me but where's my foot well it all starts three days ago oh that's the other thing
2938500	2943500	in your fucking pilots though I was using a lawnmower when do not fade in on something
2943500	2948500	interesting happening for five minutes and then go to black and say three weeks earlier
2948500	2953500	and then spend like 20 pages just getting to the guy with his figure out how to start your
2953500	2960500	story interestingly or get get it get get it there quicker you and don't use the word heroic
2960500	2964500	when referring to disabled people because they really don't if they don't like that because
2964500	2970500	it's implying that you know your existence is something that's so hard that you have to
2970500	2977500	be extraordinary to overcome it it's a term for people who go out of their way to do something
2977500	2981500	beyond the moral expectation of the average person not someone who gets out of bed every
2981500	2986500	day because otherwise they're going to be in bed I kind of cringe every time someone on CNN
2986500	2991500	or a major news organization uses the word hero let's throw it around oh boy it hasn't
2991500	2995500	been used right in a while yeah it's a hero it's like a lot of people do things that people
2995500	3000500	do in acts of crisis and stuff like that it's not heroic and also it drives me well hero
3000500	3006500	has come to mean just just cool person did a good thing just popular person hurt screaming
3006500	3011500	and told someone that's the standard of heroism nowadays and then people were like oh we
3011500	3016500	destroying America's heroes this guy was actually a domestic abuser it's like we know you gave
3016500	3022500	him the term hero really really easily you can take it away just is I mean there's too many
3022500	3026500	anything it doesn't mean anything on the other end to it I mean it yeah and then taking it
3026500	3029500	back to what I was talking about earlier when I was babbling about that documentary I loved
3029500	3034500	I think that I think that my takeaway from this whole for the whole wiki leak story which is
3034500	3039500	amazing throwing story that you watch is that we we have these systems that we totally accept
3039500	3043500	and let them to continue let them continue but as soon as one person says this system's
3043500	3048500	fucked up and I as one person am I going to do something so powerful that it's going to
3048500	3052500	fuck up with the whole system or just fuck with it a little bit we focus on that person
3052500	3058500	because they're a person and if they also have a stutter or they also have a weird personality
3058500	3064500	or like in Julius Julian Assange's cases had cases had like a sex offense charges awesome
3064500	3068500	and I'm not going like oh shit he was a crucified blah blah watch the documentary the whole
3068500	3073500	all every point surrounding story is really weird and awesome but like we focus too much
3073500	3077500	on these people and the and the systems that aren't human in the first place that are doing
3077500	3082500	all the fucked up shit that's how they like it they it's it's a system and it just stays in
3082500	3086500	place and then anybody go that starts to speak up and goes like hey can we adjust the
3086500	3090500	air conditioning in here like everyone can turn to that person and go like okay what's
3090500	3095500	your name where did you make your money last year what do you like for dinner like like
3095500	3099500	say just start talking and then you're in the spotlight and sooner or later because you're
3099500	3103500	human you're going to fail and then the system goes well so much for that alternate point
3103500	3107500	of view that failed no but don't you think he sort of cultivated that a little bit he
3107500	3112500	wanted it like the guy who came out today saying that he was the one who leaked prism
3112500	3116500	and everything you see that yes noted he's totally like cultivating a whole thing he
3116500	3120500	like has like and because he's a human being yeah yeah but in the meantime presenting
3120500	3124500	himself as that and I think yes yes because he's a human being because human beings are
3124500	3131500	braggarts and narcissists and rapists and thieves and liars and politicians and diplomats
3131500	3136500	and and and villains like lovers and healers as we can there's smokers tokers midnight
3136500	3142500	jokers they that systems never get held to that scrutiny you don't get to say this is
3142500	3147500	what Google is and you have to you have to anthropomorphize it in order to do that you
3147500	3152500	have to look like like look like like and and so they continue on being systems which
3152500	3157000	if a person did what what these systems did you would you would go well that's kind of
3157000	3161500	fucked up of you you keep you so you keep talking about freedom all the time you sure
3161500	3168500	are blowing a lot of people up fucking weirdo hypocrite look at Jerry over there he keeps
3168500	3172500	hey why don't you talk about freedom some more and like like like kill some more people
3172500	3178500	Jerry shut up get out of here lately like like a system can do that and sometimes people
3178500	3184500	represent too much when you consider President Obama as like when we saw him in 2008 he was
3184500	3189500	much more assembled in a person all right so Adam why don't you stay up here and play
3189500	3196500	Aaron McGathey's character I can't think of anything better yeah I was gonna say the same

3439500	3442500	movie I was doing a long time ago and she was saying that she and her boyfriend they'd love
3442500	3448500	to pee on each other they love how did you get to that you know it's hard being an actor
3448500	3451500	you've been in a movie set where you're in the background and you're standing next to
3451500	3456500	somebody for six hours we got to level four conversation at some point and she was saying
3456500	3459500	like she's like tattooed and kind of my punk rock look and she's like my boyfriend I would
3459500	3464500	love I love only peas I mean I love peeing on him I'm like yeah I'm not down for that

3474500	3479500	in the morning is morning he is gross I'm like okay fair enough I think they're like
3479500	3485500	connoisseurs so you have your rules about pee so you're like you're prudish to other
3485500	3489500	people too yeah like I said do you like being shit I was like no I said don't call me a
3489500	3494500	prude we all have our limits I just don't need to be a prude relative to her she just said
3494500	3500500	the clean pee rolls downhill into a bathtub I know somebody else who loves being peed on
3500500	3505500	more the shit porn I saw was also in the bathroom like as if like oh we're not we don't
3505500	3509500	want to rewrite the entire book my friends are in this my friends are in this metal band
3509500	3513500	I used to go I knew from high school they they have these parties and there was a video
3513500	3519500	tape like a VHS tape that said six six labels at six six six do not watch and they leave
3519500	3524500	it kind of not right and in play at the party but they'd be up on a shelf and somebody at
3524500	3529500	some point would see it I think like I'm gonna fucking watch that tape and they'd pop it in
3529500	3535500	and it was this black and white home video of two gals and a dude and the guy was eating
3535500	3543500	the poop out of the butts and the footage was so fucking potent so so absolutely fucking
3543500	3547500	volatile that you could people would walk in like hey what are you guys doing see one friend
3547500	3553500	they go and have to walk outside and the party would be sixteen people outside like recovering
3553500	3559500	from it and the reason why it was a bummer is the refusal of the calm there was always a moment
3559500	3564500	when the guy just as he'd eaten some poop he clearly didn't like eating the poop and then
3564500	3570500	more poop would be produced and he would kind of like God not like not to a camera tape
3570500	3579500	we're just like oh boy what a day like a like a bird in the flingstones it's a living
3579500	3584500	yeah I've got my mortgage get the fuck out of there you don't like eating the poop but this is
3584500	3589500	why this is why I want that that sharoos app to work like I mean there's there's probably
3589500	3594500	there's a hundred people here who let's eat and poop in here you can't you can't
3594500	3599500	there's a taxi driver guy you like he'd poop in an ideal society we could ask and a hand
3599500	3603500	would shoot up and they'd come up but it's like it's too easy make too easy to target you know
3603500	3608500	there well let's promise to not judge just raise your hand and we won't judge no really we just
3608500	3614500	want to know like here I was under the coffee table if you like eating poop or watching
3614500	3619500	somebody else eat the poop or having poop on you or pooping on someone with a coffee
3619500	3624500	table raise your heart does the story about Danny Thomas make you think I'm gonna give
3624500	3630500	that a try tonight anybody here raise your hand no judge anybody in this room that feels
3630500	3634500	that way has felt that way longer than you guys have been thinking of ways to get them to come
3634500	3639500	come up they've been walking that's the thing and it's like where do you draw the line you know
3639500	3645500	it's like oh I thought I thought they were coming for the people that like to eat poop so so I
3645500	3652500	didn't care and then and then one day they came for me you know yeah first the trade unionist then
3652500	3658500	especially especially if we're talking about something that actually gives you a an erection
3658500	3664500	or the female equivalent whatever that is I have no idea and never shall I'm still working on
3665500	3672500	I'll figure it out eventually but the the if that's obviously an involuntary response right to me it
3672500	3676500	seems like but it can be conditioned the tricky thing is that when you get into this point where
3676500	3681500	there's plenty of people and that's why we have you know this is an issue it's like oh you know what
3681500	3687500	gets me going is when the other person wants nothing to do with it or is too young to want
3687500	3691500	anything to do with it and blah blah and it's like oh shit okay but those and shouldn't
3691500	3695500	those shouldn't you feel sorry for those people and and and like sitting on people we're not
3695500	3699500	toward a solution with them like a lot of them want to be castrated you know like they go like
3699500	3704500	fuck I can't wait so we've gone from shit to pedophilia yeah once I'm talking raise your hands
3706500	3716500	no judgment I'm talking about unpopular sexual sexual but there's a big line between shit porn
3716500	3722500	and pedophilia well what I really want the big line being that someone gets hurt well I
3722500	3726500	would say I would say the shit porn you could be into shitting on somebody or being shit on
3726500	3731500	without being without having something broken about you but I think if you're into kids there is
3731500	3736500	something broken about you I don't think that big line moments ago was being drawn before the shit
3736500	3740500	people though where you Jeff said like you know if it said go back to the drawing board I mean
3740500	3745500	do we mean no I don't because sex is such an animal act and I think what is more animal than
3745500	3751500	like shitting on somebody so I could see I'm sort of getting convinced a little bit all right
3751500	3758500	we're bringing Kumail over is Emily still here Emily can you get one of those one of those
3758500	3771500	Valentine's Day coupons hey you said anything when you poop in your automobile is that what that
3771500	3779500	was yeah yeah yeah well I just mean like yeah that I don't think I think in order to be when
3779500	3784500	we go to the moon when we colonize the moon if you like people to poop on you in zero gravity I'm
3784500	3789500	not gonna kick you off the moon like I don't think I don't get them out of here new component those
3789500	3796500	zero gravity if you like to have sex with eight-year-old children or women that are screaming no
3796500	3801500	stop it then we have a problem because your right to swing your fist ends at the end of another
3801500	3806500	person's nose so so so now we have a we have an issue because not because of your rights because
3806500	3810500	of other other people's but if you want if you want if you want somebody to poop on you come
3810500	3818500	out of the moon we got that I also saw it like when I was 10 so part of me is like that's not
3818500	3825500	so crazy I did I mean it makes I mean if it makes other people physically gag yeah I forgot no one
3825500	3830500	no one's gonna watch you paid ten dollars to watch you do it can we call this episode 666 do not listen
3832500	3837500	all right Spencer what do you think about people pooping on each other that's weird
3840500	3844500	but what if there's a girl you have had a crush on this girl for years she's gorgeous she's amazing
3844500	3849500	she's awesome you you're like this is the perfect goal for me and she's making out with you for the
3849500	3855500	first time it's the night of your life and she's like the only thing once I have to shit on you
3855500	3865500	like and then we can be in a relationship I think that's weird I mean that would be a red flag
3865500	3871500	more so because of her weird ritualistic approach to it where like if you're that into it
3871500	3875500	why do you only want to do it once well she wants to know that he's there for you know through thick
3875500	3882500	and thin she's not even into it she's just like I just want to test you to see yeah no this is gonna
3882500	3891500	be horrible for me too it's very embarrassing it's gonna be very thick I really like the direction
3891500	3899500	the show's gone we always get to one little deep topic last time it got so deep we found out chef
3899500	3905500	had psychic powers and we went to pre-empt D&D that's why we should yeah it started down it sure
3905500	3910500	was magical though but that gives gave you a whole extra week to prepare your D&D materials
3910500	3916500	was that what I was supposed to do you were too busy shitting on people weren't you you know my
3916500	3922500	secret yeah those are the sheets you should pass them out I'll pass them out you want to
3922500	3926500	you want to catch us up to I was oh I was gonna say something with I got to now come on go
3926500	3931500	it's still about the I remember watching the shit video when I was 10 and they were pooping on
3931500	3935500	each other and then later I remember thinking like probably the saddest moment has to be when
3935500	3940500	they're like it's like maybe later that day in the shower and they find a little bit in their belly
3940500	3948500	button and they're like oh right I did that yeah cuz it's something you immediately forget once you
3948500	3957500	get home that's me thank you cool by the way I'm wearing the Hormontown shirt today it's really
3957500	3963500	very smartly smartly clad yeah there's some kind of flash sale or something is the flash sale is
3963500	3970500	the flash over or huh yeah the sale still going so fine it's like super comfortable yeah actually I
3970500	3975500	have a question okay he has a question like if we're all worried about like somebody shitting on you
3975500	3982500	no we moved on who hasn't jammed something up the shit pipe okay that's a false premise what do you
3982500	3988500	mean who has not done that I'm afraid of something coming out of it when you don't mind putting something
3988500	3994500	in it no we can't sell things here because it's a different store that's why we can't sell t-shirts
3994500	4005500	here but what you can buy them on Hormontown.com thank you for the question thank you I think I think
4005500	4013500	you I think you might have just controlled you used to work in politics right the gentleman's
4013500	4018500	question was was what's the big deal with poop coming out of your butt if if you if you could put
4018500	4025500	like a Sharpie pen up it or or or or for the you know I think the answer would be first of all my
4025500	4030500	answer would be exactly whatever I think I think a lot of people's answers would be well the poop
4030500	4034500	is like it's not it's made out of poop and then the poop gets everywhere the deal isn't that the poop
4034500	4041500	leaves the butt that's normal that's that's the whole is like if that's so weird it's not so weird
4041500	4046500	it's the poop that's normal problem it's not just a body smearing it around people that's the where
4046500	4050500	it starts to get iffy no one's questioning that poop leaves the button that's normal
4054500	4059500	what did you say sir but when you pull it back out then there's poop on it that's when you also yeah true
4060500	4066500	and that's why I only did the Sharpie thing once because I was after I had a I'm I masturbated
4066500	4071500	and I put it I put it I was like I wonder if it's gonna be great and then I wonder if this is gonna be
4071500	4079500	great is a great sentence to think before you do that the male orgasm like it shuts you off like a
4079500	4084500	light you're like and then you're just hanging out and then I was like all right gets a Sharpie pen out of
4084500	4090500	my ass and yeah it's got poop on it I'm not gonna use it to write a chore list like don't do that
4090500	4100500	again buy buy buy a new Sharpie pen yeah I don't insert disposable items but I think it has poop on it
4100500	4107500	when you pull the Sharpie pen well I mean more more so than your average Sharpie pen sure whether you
4108500	4119500	see it or not five percentile of poopy Sharpie pens sure so where were we in the adventure I don't know am I
4119500	4124500	gonna get music I mean I could do it without but that's what I do the music music whenever you like it's fine man
4125500	4135500	okay Spencer if you would last time on Harmon town D and D our narrator gave a stunning and vibrant
4135500	4141500	oratory recounting the travels and tales of our heroes then everybody talked about Jeff psychic ability
4141500	4147500	it was decided by Kumail that Jeff's abuse of his special gift was arrogant and unfortunate Dan having
4147500	4152500	heard a thousand or more of Jeff's special abilities decided that he'd simply default to his old stand
4152500	4159500	by response to these stories through drinking the subject shifted to money lending and Aaron pointed
4159500	4164500	out that Jeff although claiming to have faith in Dan's ability to remunerate Jeff's loans was simply
4164500	4170500	and shrewdly using a psychic talent to hedge his bets whereas Dan left jet or let jet money out of his
4170500	4176500	the kindness of his heart a healthy laugh was enjoyed by all and in the end nothing happened
4176500	4184500	leaving our adventurers where we last met on the material plane back home in the forest fired forest of Connie
4185500	4198500	all right I examine the surrounding Spencer you you just exited the plane of shadow around you stand
4198500	4206500	dozens of felled nothing like hundreds of felled burnt trees this is what you recognize to be the Connie forest
4206500	4213500	you met um you know uh Tylenol with Cody in the unicorn there so is Coco back Coco is back
4213500	4220500	yay and I still have something surprising nature's ally for no reason yeah so examining the surroundings
4220500	4225500	you got this down well guys we did it yeah I guess we should all just split up and go a separate way
4225500	4233500	it's nice meeting ya wait so what did we do what we managed our shadow opponents but we still have the sort
4233500	4239500	of growth and we figure out what the main thing of it is right I mean is that what are we done with the quest
4239500	4246500	I wish no we got to get the chart no knee-jerk response um yeah so I heard the soul of growth right
4246500	4254500	that was mentioned yeah yeah as it happens you hear a Dan you hear a of pulsating energy coming from your back
4254500	4264500	uh your pack rather your back was hacked is Paul Lend here I investigate I pull out the soul of growth and hold it aloft
4264500	4270500	holding the soul of growth aloft is caught with a brilliant green energy um yeah that happens
4270500	4277500	regrow the forest with the soul of growth hey that's happening a brilliant emerald light casts a bright glow on the burnt forest
4277500	4283500	as well as your party before your eyes legions of green shoots and leaves birth forth burst forth from the soil
4283500	4290500	growing at an incredible pace before your very eyes as if by magic except literally by magic
4290500	4298500	pork pork you can also hear a loud cracking shattering sound coming from the inside of your bag as well as a burst of green light from your bag
4298500	4306500	whose bags my fork I hear a cracking coming from my bag a cracking followed by a shattering of maybe glass or something
4306500	4318500	I I throw the bag down and look back a gape a second green all green light huh gape shattering they all sort of harken back to the conversation we were just
4318500	4325500	that's just you that's just your mail come on I can't get over it when you were 10 it was when I was that's just gonna happen
4325500	4332500	yeah yeah it's always gonna be there I've read a book yeah yeah so that happens you throw the bag down
4332500	4340500	then exploding from your backpack like a river of emerald light swirling around the growing green plants you see a coalescing form
4340500	4347500	it it forms from these plants and these leaves and that grow into being as well as these charred you know limbs of the tree
4347500	4357500	coalesced into a 12 foot bipedal form whoa you see golden red leaves crowning a tangle of clump of bribery thorns which seemed to be its head
4357500	4366500	glowing green eyes are embedded in its face like glowing coals living in dead plants wrapped around each other and tied together by thin green sinewy vines
4366500	4375500	form into a bipedal shape with four fingers on each of its two hands on each of its two arms and two large stump like legs it speaks in a powerful voice
4375500	4385500	thanks for releasing me no problem what the hell what the hell was in my bag this guy I was forged into the knife
4385500	4394500	people are getting it but Spencer's doing a very wonderful beard shake when he does this creature's voice it's more of a throat shake
4394500	4406500	are you my talking dagger I was to be told true I am the true soul of growth what you have there was a fraction of my powers
4406500	4416500	what's your name my name is the soul of growth can I ask it a question yeah are you friend or foe
4416500	4427500	for releasing me and granting me back some of my powers I would say your friends and I am your ally is it nice politically incorrect to climb you
4428500	4442500	at this point I think so in our culture it's a friendship symbol I did go for it I'm like an avatar of nature well we're like natures to be enjoyed haven't you read or been the giving tree
4442500	4454500	I hope people enjoy why don't we let that temporarily conclude the amount of arguing we do with the 12 foot tree monster who wants to be our friend okay
4454500	4483500	the seasons are mine to the command I'm sorry what what I'm sorry the seasons are mine to come okay all right just a little bit you want any more credentials credentials credential where did you out did you did you go to college I can produce my CV what kind of music do you like I don't know
4483500	4512500	when you do produce food with sunlight one of the tier of growth powers the tier of growth being that thing you hold can produce food for you for anybody we should eat let's eat stuff where's the tier of growth lose fourth natures bounty do you have any burritos he he spreads his hand wide and the soul of growth kind of glows brightly before like basically like distributing on the floor like a banana
4512500	4542480	and you know like there's some tubers and some mushrooms like a bunch of edible produce I can I take the banana okay yeah you wanted the banana there's multiple bananas I'll take all the tubers to tubers all right all right thank you let's I prepare like a campfire I take through a lot let's get some food back and enjoy having shadows which I assume we have now you do yeah we spent like eight sessions going for those things it was a big deal for a while yeah yeah can we give this a soul of growth
4542480	4569480	so it's like a nickname like a handle solely solely like so solely growth or growth or growth or I was so growth or solely growth or root root root root rooty Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy man branch Rudy man branch Rudy man branch yeah I thought I thought you were I was Rudy

4613140	4628740	servant he said he was there to help us in service I mean in the seasons where arts to command if you if you could forgive us I mean you're a creature in nature so you probably do less drinking than us like we kind of lose track of what we were doing a lot
4628980	4658660	and we're kind of wondering like like what news from the material plane what we were doing when we left yeah hey Rudy what were we doing this is like the hangover I mean I just you know this would be indeed has a voice over yeah how would he know yeah he was with us the entire time reaching all the way back my dad had a thing like you were trying to get back with your dad he swallowed one of the shards of flim flam yeah I was kind of getting
4658880	4674420	really stuck right on guy and momentarily like revolution you are like all all this and you know he supported me in a way that I think we've realized I really appreciate him hanging into this last week but the last thing that happened is you were with your dad
4674420	4680600	if quark got sharpie to throw him onto one of these robots and the robots just took him into a fucking airship
4680600	4689840	it's all coming back that happened in Brooklyn yeah yeah fought that guy and Jason Sudeikis yeah okay yeah all right all right my dad my dad's in trouble we hey Rudy
4689840	4699740	and I start talking and what I do is I'm talking as I ask him if he can get us back quickly to wherever we were when that happened
4699740	4711680	he's like I would be rather ingracious not to grant you this request however could you give me the soul of growth it will complete my powers
4711680	4721400	now just moments ago you said you were yourself the soul of growth and I just I don't want to get caught up in semantics but semantics wise I was referring to the tear of growth
4721400	4739500	you are the tear of growth I am the soul of growth the tear of growth was a mere imitation you want the tear of growth that's about the size of it we should have a meeting away from him to figure out maybe he's a bad guy and wants I'm sorry Rudy no offense
4739500	4769500	what do we get for the tear of growth we get we get it healed you know what I'm saying what do we he wants it but what's he yeah well yeah what's in it for us Rudy I can grant you the power of the seasons and I will take you to your father oh let's do it that sounds like just give it to him I mean it's just at this point it's just a banana maker I I take the tear of growth and I flip it like a coin to him and I go I'm gonna on record say that I'm against this idea yeah I'm against it but I'm not
4769500	4799500	stopping all right but go ahead do whatever you guys do I take it I go you know a kid you're all right and I flip it and it goes to the like like Michael Jackson well meet Joe Green throws the towel to the kids and they don't show commercial and also as it flips through the air it kind of slows down and I think in its reflective surfaces we see some of the cooler moments from our campaign yeah when I fired like hugging and like when I fired you had sex with my horse yeah and enya play
4799500	4828460	I think enigma should play go ahead I'm imagining it it's lovely in my mind all right anyway I'm also gonna put my hair into like Liberty spikes you know with mud down into just cutting into Liberty spikes Jeff fucks the horse I fire two arrows my dad ate a shard
4828460	4857940	okay what if the tears stabbed him in the face and he died I chop off the dragon's dick we get two people instead of sparing them we have them murder each other and then we kill the survivor all right so so now Rudy catches the the tear of growth I imagine right oh yeah yeah that was happening what happens well I was gonna say yeah so he he catches it I mean as you do
4857940	4887660	and you see a kind of void open up in his kind of chestal regions as like vines and tendrils kind of move out of the space and he's a girl tree he puts it back up in it and why is your girl tree he has a void in his torso heart his chestal regions it's not there's a hole in his soul so he's a woman is that we all know women are woefully incomplete as a spiritual being yeah why why is it a girl because he's with me and they have cooties
4887860	4917180	you said he had a chest vagina is that what you think that's what I'm doing stand down sir if you really want to recap I thought of the idea of saying that he's a girl before he got to the point where he said it was in his chest and then I wouldn't let it go because I'm I'm I'm I'm a I'm a petty entertainer because Rita Rudy could go either way Rudy could be do to our woman okay or trio yeah yeah anyway so like little vines they're doing stuff
4917580	4946700	wrapping around things specifically the soul growth they entwine it and then the void kind of closes up and then he's he's taken by like it looks like he's on fire but it's like green like magical energy emanating from his body he's a girl he's a girl okay he's like take this and then he he he reaches out a finger at you guys what's that is that a kind of banana it's like a finger but with a
4947100	4966900	softer G he gives us he gives us the finger is he saying pull my finger he's not he's more he's he's gonna kind of like touch you guys I reach out my fringe all right can I just call it a finger we all we all reach out our fingers and and like torta they start
4966900	4996660	finging play play that play that Enigma song again I think there'd be like magical light now but yeah this isn't the world of Dungeons and Dragons in real life I'm afraid anyway so you feel like a rush of wind kind of overtake you and Dan you feel you feel kind of a vibrant force welling up inside of you and you you feel
4996900	5026660	the dry cold winds blow upon you and wait me a crystal burger Krista Berg does more rain feels that the summer heat of summer and the wintery chill of icy cold breeze blasts into a quark and you feel spiritual elemental energy taking you up you're not quite sure what this is are we like captain planet now not quite not quite I forgot what I felt because I was first it was easier to connect the dots after you went down
5027300	5037780	what did I feel it humidity what was it the magic spring spring fall okay I'm summer winter yeah okay whose heart
5042100	5046420	we are the season these are the reasons
5046900	5052820	it's good that we didn't have a fifth person in the show
5063700	5071700	teleporting to the plot hi so uh the wind kind of diminishes and you feel up the central presence
5071700	5076820	residing on your kind of forearm area and it coalesces there's there's a ring of energy
5076820	5083140	that hardens into it looks kind of like a tangle of uh of like like vines and stuff well it looks
5083140	5089620	like a douchebag tattoo kind of except it's not a tattoo we got vine tattoos except it's not a tattoo
5089620	5094980	it's like made out of uh fine gold it's like jewelry but kind of stylized like a gauntlet
5094980	5099860	around our forearms yeah kind of like that it's cool dude it's not super cool I'm not going to
5099860	5107300	really sell it hard it's just a thing can might not be vines can it will be barbed wire give him
5107300	5113140	barbed wire can I get can I get Christmas lights no autumn leaves I was winter Jeff could get no
5113140	5118180	you were summer Jeff was winter can I get Calvin from Calvin Hobbs pissing on a Chevy symbol
5118820	5124580	only if he's wearing a snow jacket okay yeah it's cool he's peeing ice onto a Chevy I examine the
5124580	5130820	surroundings can I get the Chinese symbol for fall instead of just you don't look like he
5130820	5137860	scrawls like douchebag and okay oh this looks great thanks but yeah yeah your surroundings
5137860	5143460	are unchanged so now we have these magical uh forearm gauntlets of the powers of our seasons
5143460	5149380	they contain the power of this they contain the power of the season thank you Rudy sorry
5149460	5156260	sorry what voiceover oh no that wasn't talking no I get it I just throw that you started with
5156260	5160340	voiceover now it was a Dan write some write some voiceover for Rudy like if it was a script about
5160340	5167300	Rudy like bad so there I was back to the real out reality plane just gotten my new powers
5167300	5170500	but now look at these jokers all dressed up with the seasons
5170500	5180980	all dressed up like the seasons that's his internal monologue yeah are there any roads
5180980	5184900	leading away from where we're standing right now um he's like there aren't any you're kind of in
5184900	5192580	the middle of like a burnt down forest but he's like he's like if we will go let us go all right
5192580	5200020	I'm a tracker so I'm I can track yeah not a lot in that sentence yeah well knowing this area you
5200100	5205540	know uh the cardinal direction of where yellow camp is that's you know butts a lot's camp so
5205540	5211140	you kind of have an idea of where it is anyway but he's gonna he's gonna spirit you away there
5211140	5216980	all right let's go there all right do it yeah oh so I hold up my my are there on our right arms
5216980	5222340	or our little season gauntlets you can pick whatever army well left arm I hold up whatever
5222340	5226180	arm mine mine is on and I and I hold it forward like we're like now like the super friends
5226900	5230820	like it's like captain planet I guess I don't know what captain planet is
5232740	5239700	it's like voltron but it was like but but like people recycling yeah the the criminal like the
5239700	5244420	the villains like use too much water on their golf courses that they are okay like literally
5244420	5249300	Kwame your tv is too big wheeler you have too many children this was an actual captain
5249300	5255220	planet plot in the future they all bickered each other for being assholes it was the best episode
5256180	5259700	okay I put my arm back down because that didn't work yeah nothing happens
5260420	5266980	sorry I was trying to come a little catchphrase thing that we do by the power of summer or winter
5266980	5274500	summer fall spring let's be seasons together seasons together
5276820	5281620	is that can beat could that be our group minutes seasons together yeah it's like a really terrible
5282180	5284420	yeah the first season was better is that bill
5285460	5287460	beef market bill called us the four seasons
5288020	5292900	luxury accommodations efficiency affordability four seasons
5294980	5299300	it's not affordability it's very expensive oh yeah well well for some people
5300820	5308020	okay so having worked having workshopped our our new catchphrase uh uh we we we embark with
5308260	5313620	with Rudy towards the yellow camp he um he puts his hands to like a small sapling style tree and
5313620	5319620	he like touches it and it gets super huge really big tree and then he's like step in like it's a
5319620	5325940	door it's not a door it's a tree I tell him that all right I I just because I'm so soaked about my
5325940	5334340	new winter powers I just I said it I'm cool with that okay all right yeah fuck all of you I swear to
5334340	5340660	god I'm gonna make you all eat my poop later I'm skeptical and I go I won't fall for that
5344980	5352180	these jokes you like I've been up here for 500 days of summer yay you got it
5352180	5355540	this idea is traditionally associated with fertility
5358820	5361700	I thought you were gonna spring into action or something but I like that
5362580	5369380	that too okay so I I just I in my barbarian uh impulsiveness I just jump through the uh
5369380	5374820	into the tree portal okay the rest of you see Jeff kind of won't into the tree like platform
5374820	5383780	nine and three quarters style I won't after him I won't also men because my character is female
5383780	5387620	and that's that's what Aaron would have said guys can we close the portal before
5391940	5396500	is there a lock is there a lock I see one plus you guys falling into something that's not a
5396500	5400500	portal because he said it's not it's a tree and not a portal the portal closes while he's talking
5400500	5406180	about that all right me and coco track our way to where they're going I stick my head out of the
5406180	5413540	portal go more rain stay here and guard the rear I have to from you because he fucks everything
5413540	5421060	yeah yeah that was good that was legit okay that was legit that was like the joke judge I am
5421060	5427140	I have that's uh overruled then I have tables then I go back I want my head back in all right
5427700	5433300	that happens all right okay I go through the portal okay so you come out inside of a much
5433300	5438340	smaller tree you don't know how you it's magic whatever tree walking yeah yeah tree walking
5438340	5444900	that's a spell it is look it up anyway you get out and before you you see the familiar yellow
5444900	5450900	canvas of yellow camp however um usually this is like a circus like kind of tent style rather
5450900	5455860	than that it's more like you see it stretched between watch towers and these watch towers are
5455860	5465300	black and foreboding much has changed since you've left how long were we gone for I don't know
5467780	5473620	aren't you nature and based on seasons isn't your whole thing about the cycle of the year
5473620	5480500	and the seasons inside of a knife time is really complicated okay all right so is anyone around we
5480500	5485860	can ask them what the date is you're still about uh no you're still about 400 feet off from kind of
5485860	5491060	the walls um you can kind of see a couple guards yeah let's walk to the guards yeah yeah I mean
5491060	5495940	they should be good people yellow camp I mean this is our town also you know it's time to level up
5495940	5500340	I'm supporting for another fight I got my shadow back I'm ready to rock and roll you don't get to
5500340	5504260	say when it's time to level up that's I'm saying but you got to get some experience points and
5504260	5509780	fight oh oh oh yeah yeah he's itching to level up okay let's go find some find some people yeah
5509780	5514980	so um as you near as you near the towers of uh yellow camp you don't actually see any guards
5514980	5521620	posted it's it's rather odd you don't see really anyone um you do see some some smoke kind of
5521620	5528420	rising from the center of camp kind of like a like a smokestack maybe you don't see a smokestack but
5528420	5534820	it's that kind of calm father I run to toward it I'm not even being careful sharpie wait be careful
5534820	5543060	no okay you're at that can't say no he was too far away I couldn't hear all right did he say no
5543060	5549540	there I was watching my boyfriend sharpie run away towards fire that's my life I have liberty
5549540	5556740	spice now he's doing the video yeah yeah we know we know I don't I thought their their
5556740	5562900	pre-disposal to resent Adam is I was burning some on me I'm not it's not because they didn't like
5562900	5569300	me it's because if the joke's been done too much anyway so we get you get to the can we can we run
5569300	5574100	behind him we if you want yeah yeah yeah guys you want to do that let's do it you're at a point
5574100	5579460	where you're on the cusp of throwing open the canvas and revealing the inside of this camp
5579460	5586500	yeah let's do it guys we're the four seasons we can do this yeah let's walk like a man yeah let's
5586580	5592580	get same walk like a man I won't fall for this I use my line way too yeah I go I'm still cool
5593460	5598100	we use our catchphrase too much we just came up with them we like them a lot tell it to them
5600820	5607140	so you throw open the canvas and kind of enter this area and you are struck with like a horrifying
5607140	5612740	sight barbarians aren't really known for industry however you see like these metal constructions
5612740	5617940	that look like maybe kilns or some sort of large oven style thing that are kind of set up in the
5617940	5622660	middle there's two of them they dominate the space they get holocausted oh god it's not like that
5622660	5627540	okay sorry just spoiler it right now sorry sorry holocaust survivors it's not like that
5629060	5633940	and non-survivors I think the number of holocaust survivors who listen to this podcast
5633940	5638740	is very small very small event diagram I'm not willing to take that risk okay
5639300	5643940	it's irresponsible all right so they're using kilns inside of a tent yeah you see some people
5643940	5649380	kind of um you know like cattle can be pushed around in a circle to like be harnessed yeah
5649380	5654260	there's people doing that so there's a bunch of a bunch of barbarians you see humans and gnolls
5654260	5659620	alike if you recall there's no alliance with the butts a lot tribe going on back in the way past
5659620	5664900	so yeah they're both they're both chained up and you see like uh it looks like a scrawny um his
5664900	5669460	skin is like gray and emaciated with like you can see kind of like white lights kind of like
5669460	5675220	emanating from his body and he's got a scraggly like a beard made out of tentacles um they're
5675220	5679780	really thin kind of tentacles that's what that's what a lash that's not what a gnoll is that's the
5679780	5684260	bad guy this is yeah this is some sort of crazy humanoid that's whipping these gnolls and these
5684260	5688420	humans gnolls are like uh and they're operating some sort of mill or some sort of like like yeah
5688420	5694420	they're being pushed around in a circle and that's that's put up to like a his mind flare he's not
5694420	5700340	no you know you've seen them you've heard of mind flares and and these these this looks more
5700340	5705220	like maybe some sort of demonic creature maybe a devil or a demon or an abomination and what are
5705220	5711380	these chris sneak over stab him in the spine no no no let's talk about this first i go and pledge
5711380	5720340	allegiance to that guy all right i'm not gonna stop you okay you also see similar sites like
5720340	5725060	there's kind of like a three different kind of turbines of human energy and they're all being
5725060	5730820	attended to by demons and if you recall there's these puddles of flesh demons that you saw way
5730820	5735860	earlier they look like slimy puddles of a flesh covered goop that hold themselves together and
5735860	5741060	roughly have arms they're kind of sliding around as if on patrol kind of around the area and they've
5741060	5746420	seen us did we kind of they haven't you've kind of found yourself between too little like uh
5746980	5751220	recognizing them now um you're so horrified before you don't really see them but these are large
5751220	5755780	black empty cages so they're made out of iron so you're kind of hiding behind these and in the very
5755780	5760180	center of this area you can kind of see between two of these uh engines you see a giant pit in
5760180	5768820	the ground giant giant pit giant pit giant pit jesus well we really bit off uh more than we can
5768820	5773140	chew here yeah running into this giant yellow tent but i'm feeling pretty good i got my hit points
5773140	5779140	back i'm uh i'm spoiling for a fight i think we should leave this place you are you sure your dad's
5779140	5786500	here well i mean his peeps are but it's 9 48 we should uh you know what these people have been
5786500	5794100	through a lot we talked about talked about eating shit for like 25 minutes uh you know
5794100	5799220	adam's been there have been puns yeah a regular like he said he's on stage that is not on par with
5799220	5808100	the previous thing no no yeah no one's much worse not all jenga blocks are shaped the same but you
5808100	5814420	know a certain amount of them results in a collapse uh yeah it's uh i mean i don't know
5814420	5818900	what because we can't we can't get into a fight with a bunch of no you're right and then and
5819620	5824820	slimers okay well so we're established for next time we know we now and now we know what's set
5824900	5830100	up we're ready to i'm gonna have to reset it up next week though yeah yeah but we made friends
5830100	5835140	with rudy we're now the four seasons yeah you think we should use our next 11 minutes to no
5835140	5840660	i'm just saying is rudy with us by the way yeah well he's not actually he's he's behind you you
5840660	5844900	when you burst through the tent you lost track of him but he was kind of a little like maybe 10 feet
5844900	5848740	behind you you've you've lost track of him at this point unless you kind of go back but he did come
5848740	5853940	with us to yellow camp he got you he got you there and he followed you and he would have gone in you'd
5853940	5860420	think but then he didn't come in well i mean we probably have to use our powers our our new
5860420	5866580	seasonal powers to destroy or take over yeah yeah i don't know what that really means though
5867620	5871700	we'll do it next time we should have tried them while we were outside the yellow tent to see what
5871700	5877700	they flash back to us trying out our powers yeah it's a good thing we tried out our powers yeah
5877700	5883780	well you did try holding them aloft dramatically yeah okay can we all can we all retreat away kind
5883780	5887780	of go into a clearing we can all just try out our new powers just kind of see what we got i'm gonna
5887780	5892980	have to actually roll some dice for that oh shit well but we don't want to do it in front of the
5892980	5896980	yeah yeah we we move into it like we get away from i think he's really nice to see if we can just
5896980	5904020	barge into a tent and then and then take a take an audible no no no don't have super strength okay
5904020	5907860	so your speed no come on okay all right yeah everyone makes it all right we just kind of we
5907860	5915460	just kind of backed out we heard a record scratch guys let's go to the firing range i like i i see
5915460	5921380	like uh like is there any like any river or water or and it was what's the topography around me
5921380	5927060	right now it's kind of like hilly and uh there's the occasional tree kind of like a chaperone i i
5927060	5932580	see a little small bush like a chaparral shrub and i and i i i hold my hand as i don't know what
5932580	5938180	to expect out of my winter powers and i go winter power oh this bush i want to see
5939220	5945060	because no harm in triumph you feel an extreme chill come over your arm but that's about it what
5946900	5949540	your power is you can make your hand your first attempt
5950900	5953620	my first it's like you can give yourself the stranger that's it
5955140	5958580	i go i i go up and touch the bush that he was pointing at
5958580	5966020	you see like a almost open bud open slightly more than it was oh we have budding like nascent
5966020	5972500	powers or you're just doing them wrong can i go to oh all right uh grab my arm and try using it
5972500	5985380	i do it correctly a stunning no um you don't how do you attempt i go and i i rub my hand i rub my
5985380	5997780	hand nothing i kiss it and i wave it one nothing happens i i i have knowledge nature so i'm gonna
5997780	6003700	just start saying nature words and elvish until my arm activates which nature words uh stunning
6003700	6012740	sunset go with days go with activate activate nope none of those pitiful guess i walk over to
6012740	6018820	rudy and i go rudy how do we use these fucking things yeah that's a great way to solve this
6018820	6027140	problem but it'll take me some to determine the amount of time to teach you guys behind the scenes
6027140	6032260	really so we have to we have to prepare these spells kind of we'd have to break here
6035060	6040580	the fourth wall so when we yes so when we come back we learn these spells then we're
6040580	6043460	going to go into the yellow tent and use them all right that's good i think we made the right
6043460	6050820	choices we learned a lot spencer thank you so much adam goldberg well done my friends
