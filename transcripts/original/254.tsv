0	14240	From Gorgeous Uptown Burbank, Harman Town, once again, is in session.
14240	29360	Please welcome the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden, and the mayor of the mostest, Spencer Crittenden.
29920	30720	Dan Harman!
34720	36000	Hello, hello, thank you.
40080	45120	I mean, obviously, it's like, you know, hello, how are you? And the usual niceties,
45120	51680	I also should add, I'm not a Nazi. Like, that's a new thing that you just add to be polite.
52320	58080	That's the new minimum definition of inter-human communication. You want to start,
58160	62480	I'm not a Nazi. You have to know that. But if it go a little something.
65040	69200	And then you say, oh, Dan, you're pandering, you're virtue signaling, right?
69200	75280	Isn't that what you call it? You fucks. Yeah. Oh, you say you're not a Nazi, and then you get a big
75280	80640	bell and a cookie, because that's so easy to say you're not a Nazi. Well, no, it's not that easy
80640	85760	to say, is it? It's not easy to say you're not a Nazi. The president has a difficult time.
86080	93360	And he has no repercussions to fear, really, except for some Nazis not voting for him.
94160	98720	And he has traded that today. He has officially decreed to the extent that a compulsively
98720	104160	dishonest parasite can decree anything. He has decreed that he is a Nazi, because there are
104160	109680	people goose stepping down a main street in the heart of America, whoever the fuck that place is.
110160	118560	And it would have been so easy to trade a couple of Nazi votes for what he might have hoped would
118560	126400	be a couple of non-Nazi votes. Perhaps the easiest votes to get of all. Simple non-Nazi votes,
127040	134800	low-hanging democratic fruit, it's been called. I promise to not be a Nazi. You're hired these days.
134960	141040	But he couldn't do it. He couldn't bring himself to do it. And that is as close as you're going to
141040	147200	get with a coward to his saying, I'm a Nazi, which is what he says. He just wants to be loved
148560	155200	by Nazis. And just wanting to be loved is important and human. We all just want to be
155200	159600	loved. And the big question is, when you are not loved and a Nazi is across the street going,
159600	165840	you who? Do you go back to being not loved or walk across the street?
167600	172880	That is what this civil war, and I promise you that's what's brewing, is going to be all about.
172880	177600	And it's fucking over. The discourse is over. We have sat, we have talked, we have argued,
177600	183840	we have pondered. The discourse is over. These people that tweet you when you retweet somebody,
183840	189120	when you just say a simple fact that should not cause you to get a knot in your stomach like,
189120	195440	I'm not a Nazi. The people that tweet you and say, nor am I, but just out of curiosity,
198160	203920	just tell them to go fuck themselves. The discourse is over. The war has begun. You don't,
203920	208160	you're not talking to Nazis anymore. You're not talking to people that want to entertain the
208160	212400	notion of being a Nazi anymore. You don't want to talk to people that want to circumscribe the
212400	218080	concept of Nazism within a fucking Socratic dialectic about goddamn whether Nazi, Nazi,
218560	225040	they're fucking Nazis. It's the bedrock of humanity. It is so low that the worst people in
225040	231600	the world find it. And that's where they rally. And it's so low. We have gotten so bad that a
231600	238960	third of our country has gotten there. 29% of the people are fucking Nazis. Let's face it. That's a
238960	246640	minority. We can beat them. We have to say I'm not a Nazi though. Two thirds of the country just
246720	254800	don't want to be political. It's not politics to say you're not a Nazi. It's like taking a shit.
256560	268320	You just do it or you explode. You die if you don't shit and you die if you don't say you're not a Nazi.
268320	277520	Fascism is a fucking cancer. It will eat your country unless your country kills it. Here's
277520	284160	what happens when you get cancer. Nothing good. Nothing. There is no way out of it. I'm your
284160	292480	country's doctor. You've got cancer. You have fascism. You are going to suffer. You are going
292560	300160	to fight. You are going to feel pain. You are not getting out of this. We have fascism. It is
300160	310640	happening. We're fucking dead maybe. Or maybe they're dead. That's about it. It's not a continuum.
310640	317120	There's no gray area. It's not a fad. Fascism doesn't pop up and then recede when it finds
317120	323680	out no one is into it. It doesn't respond to love. It doesn't respond to hate. It doesn't
323680	328000	respond to ignoring it. It doesn't respond to time outs. It doesn't respond to attention. It
328000	334160	doesn't respond to lack of attention. You stab it. You cut it out. You bombard it with poison.
334160	341840	Or you die and in any case you will probably die. Don't die talking to cancer. Don't die
341840	349520	hanging out with it. Don't die arguing with it on Twitter. It's fucking fascism. Enough. Team up.
349520	354800	Stop bitching about Bernie Sanders. I don't care what flavor you want your democracy to be.
354800	363600	It's democracy versus motherfucking fascism. You can be as Bernie as you want.
363600	368560	You've got to do it later man. You've got to do it fucking later. You've got to do it later.
371840	381680	You've got to do it later. You've got to do it later. You've got to do it later. You've got to do it later.
381680	389280	All right so so I have fingernail questions because I went on a week-long trip and I was
389280	395360	That was a fucking hairpin turn man. I'm not going to pack my fingernail clippers for one trip
395920	400160	and then they do they grow from the root and they just push forward that's where the white lines
400240	403280	happen and those happen so fast and we still haven't developed a pill.
406000	411600	How do you join Antifa? What is that? That's just like a slur for not being a Nazi.
413280	418640	Is that a term that's been invented by the opposition? Yeah more or less. I mean it takes
418640	424160	the fascist out of anti-fascism. Right it's like the optics couldn't be better on the term
424160	428480	anti-fascist. You don't want to lose that part. Right that's why they lost it is because otherwise
428480	434160	they'd say anti-fascist which they're talking about themselves. So they wanted so the bad guys
434160	438640	shortened it to anti-fascist that sounds like a Middle Eastern. That's my perception who knows.
440800	445040	Well I looked it up. Right. Spencer where do you fall on fascism? I love it.
446640	454160	But only when it's under my banner because I happen to be right. Stop arguing with them.
454400	459760	I every every person there's there's there's 20 dudes willing to take their khakis and their
459760	464960	tiki torches down under the ship. They're not even the worst of the bad guys. It's the six to one
464960	469040	out numbering them that are just sitting there watching on their laptops going like oh they have
469040	475760	a point. Fuck them. Shame them. Find them. Make them say I'm a Nazi. Introduce yourself to all
475760	481280	of your friends tomorrow. Hello I'm not a Nazi. Make everyone say it or don't say it. It's come
481360	488640	to that. I'm sorry. It's called quarantining. The president cannot say I'm not a Nazi. Let's
488640	494240	make it the cool thing to do. Let's see if he catches on. Let's see if he's the last person
494240	501200	to say it. The whole tiki torch thing. How many home depots are in Virginia? Like that's a lot
501200	506560	of fucking tiki torches. And how in love are they with that culture. The island culture.
507280	514400	Or do they just hate mosquitoes that bad? They're throwing the only luau where nobody got laid.
518160	522560	You know the whole protest the whole protest is all in the pockets of big tiki torch.
524080	529840	Here's a fun joke. That was churches joke from earlier. I still heard joke.
530800	539600	Uh uh knock knock. Who's there? Funny. Funny who? Funny Nazi. Funny Nazi who? A funny Nazi
539600	544720	doesn't exist. There's no such thing. Have you ever gotten a laugh from interacting with any of
544720	549840	these people? Is that you have to lose your humor before you get to that point. There is no they're
549840	555360	not making music videos these people. They're not talented dancers. There's not there's that there's
555360	560720	no there's no you always see the people there's like I saw Hart Hanson the poor kind Canadian soul
560720	566880	created bones probably fed these people their fucking murder bones for 20 years of fucking
566880	572560	syndicated bones episodes and he bought he bothers to say like well that president seems like a fart
572560	578080	face and then like someone's gone like hey you know I love your show but uh you know respecting
578080	587360	the president uh uh should be a thing like what what what what what fuck you man like like like

634560	639680	i'm a little disappointed actually i thought our our crowd is big enough to
639680	643120	have a couple nazis is anybody kind of a nazi
647360	651520	all right so here's the way we're here's the ways we could die we could die by nazi like we're
651520	657040	you know somebody i know i'm gonna die the the my longest longevity will be like firing squad
657040	660800	like because i'm on record now i've said i've said i don't like nazis you guys are still in

688000	690000	psych
696000	701760	dan harman turned into creamer the nazis turned dan harman into creamer ironically
702800	709840	okay uh anyways sorry sorry look i mean look i'm just i look i didn't know i i don't script the

725120	730400	i don't know he also wants to make up a new word called cathartify i don't know you know and i know
730400	733760	there's no straight answer like for all of you you're not all feeling the same way at all sometimes
733760	737360	some of you are coming here to escape this stuff and then you're bummed out oh dan's just as mad as
737360	740320	i am i don't know i don't want this shit i don't want to listen to dad yell about what i'm yelling
740320	744720	about some of you are coming to oh god what if i just talked about minecraft for two hours you'd
744720	750800	be like why didn't you do that is he a nazi you like like see i i i feel like like i i don't want
750800	755280	to be a conspiracy theorist but you're like a classic distraction tactic is like when you're
755280	759760	under investigation by special counsel and all the stuff like you start saying oh i want to bomb
759760	763920	korea korea's gonna bomb us and all the stuff or like you know like all this shit and i think that
763920	768400	trump is distracting from the real issue of the day which is if you have a dragon why are you
768400	777840	gonna write it into battle if you're the fucking queen because you gotta hear you say dracari's
777840	783280	because if you don't say dracari's into his ear it might melt like the like the thrackey you don't
783280	787120	fucking well i don't think they'll do it well i guess they might you don't write it in there
787120	791760	you don't write it you fucking you you have to have remote control technology isn't there
791760	796000	lying a couple like last season or peter dinklage is like lacking and he goes like oh yes of course
796080	802240	everyone knows the dragons have a limited bond with the people that save them and they that
802240	806240	they recognize the like he does like a little line of exposition that kind of buffers it it's
806240	813360	like yeah i thought i remembered that because i was like oh that was a lot of leather right if
813360	818240	that doesn't go anywhere and it didn't in that season at least well not really i think it was
818240	821760	just like a patch over the whole thing where it's just like you can take you know the dragons could
821760	825840	be in a basement and be bummed out that they're chained up and almost eat you but then you can
825840	829920	take a bad guy there you can take your husband and then the things but then you can fly him over
829920	835360	and they can hit the ships that you need i don't know who cares it's a good enough show have you
835920	838960	have you guys seen king of queens game of thrones is good enough
841600	848880	i was in the desert i i've seen more episodes of king of queens than any any fucking person
848880	854320	since the janiva convention should be required to watch this show is fucking insane i started
854400	863040	to love it because it became a hero because it was doing television so wrong and surviving it
863040	868640	became frodo it was like carrying the ring of entertainment to a volcano and throwing it in
869600	876640	and i was sauron going like well fuck it then i'll die i i love it then i guess i understand your
876640	882720	third episode in a row about your relationship with your neighbors i i just like it's insane
882720	892560	that show it's fucking nuts it's like watching a lizard cook on a rock in that it's fine after a
892560	902080	while but if anyone thought you'd be ashamed of yourself what what what's up everybody bringing
902080	912160	the alcohol steve leavy all right alcohol bringer to the stars okay uh i'm sorry i'm really sorry

1405520	1408880	it really felt like we made fast best friends at least on my side like
1408880	1415600	okay this is where we wanted to break the news to you den i'm like only your third favorite person
1416640	1420880	oh your your episode was very well liked as far as as far as we can tell oh really i mean i'm
1420880	1425120	certainly on our end right but in terms of the fans how much do you guys look at though i mean
1425120	1428960	you're in this gaming community i'm not going to throw the whole community under the bus but let's
1428960	1436400	face it i mean come on nazis right just a large share of what's the deal with nazi i mean come on
1436400	1440480	to the point where i can't put you in a corner and make you say yes or no to that like like it's
1440480	1447680	a it's a it's a they're there they exist they aren't nazis they're shut there no you're very
1447680	1451440	you're very right because i've experienced the same thing where it's like i can i can come on
1451440	1456080	stage and just be like yeah fuck nazis right but like if i said that on twitter it's like it's a
1456080	1461120	whole thing and then people start and then it's like oh but you and i want to talk about this
1461120	1465760	instead it's like no no don't fucking skirt the issue man we're talking about hating nazis right
1465760	1471440	now we're talking about game grumping it is weird there's a game uh that we used to play i
1472080	1475840	this is probably not unique to us but like we would look at the youtube comments and see how
1475840	1480560	it started and then see like what it ended up being like 45 comments later and it would always
1480560	1484400	start with stuff like man the cat in the head is a dumb game and then the last one is like fucking
1484400	1490560	jews youtube comments are amazing it's like yeah it's like fun to play that game of like well this
1490640	1496720	is a knitting tutorial this can't get racist and there's just like 12 comments and it's like
1496720	1505520	typical libtards n-word loving of course you do a crook stitch uh i mean it's perfect basically
1505520	1510400	because the way they format comments is like you see the first comment and then it beds the other
1510400	1515200	replies to that comment underneath it but it only shows the last comment in that thread so it'll
1515200	1520960	just be like i like when dan said this funny thing and then it ends with fucking jews like
1520960	1525120	literally that's where that's where it goes it's a bad time oh good yeah i mean it's especially
1525120	1530480	bad time to go after jews because even the nazis uh are into them now i know i'm a jew
1532000	1537360	there's like it's not that kind of naziism right at the moment the the the my girlfriends feel
1537360	1541920	safe like you know like jared kushner is uh is the israeli prime minister i think right now i
1542640	1548640	it's we're we're fine in that department it's not going to manifest itself in quite that way
1548640	1553840	it's a different it's a new nazi it's not your mama's nazi no it's the hot new nazi on the
1553840	1561840	streets there's like frosted tips on the swastika if you look if you look real close um but uh no
1561840	1567280	but what i was gonna say is i i think you know and this is you know i get it the get i i get it
1567280	1573120	and i don't get it i don't pretend uh i i the gamer the gamer community has had its good times
1573120	1578080	and it's bad the one thing that's kind of persisted is it's a passionate community a lot a lot of very
1578080	1581920	cool people are passionate about being gamers and a lot of horrible people are passionate about it
1581920	1590320	etc etc it but the but do you guys look at comments you just implied that you do no no
1590320	1595280	not anymore okay we we did when we started because it's you know you you don't know what
1595280	1599200	you're in for and there's that kind of feeling of like oh cool they're saying stuff about us
1599200	1604160	and i can learn from it you can't fucking learn anything anything from it yeah i always wonder
1604160	1608720	about that because i was i would obsess about it with community and i felt safe i must have been
1608720	1614320	incredibly popular for two seasons of community because like because i didn't i never really
1614320	1620560	encountered so much that it made me cry and now i can't look at anything without starting to cry
1620640	1627120	like it could be dude but maybe it's just like but but but but but i got a way like for a while
1627120	1631760	i was like insisting on it and i would say i would say like like uh uh uh you know like the
1631760	1637200	modern family uh uh show runners would be like oh you sure are active on twitter and i got like
1637200	1643920	yeah well you sure aren't handsome and successful and you showed them and then you know you should
1643920	1647760	be careful that feedback loop don't you're concerned about the feedback loop and i'm like
1647760	1652880	feedback loop you mean like giving the power to the people yo and then but then now all these
1652880	1660240	years later i'm like fuck everyone like i cannot stand you i hate all of you everyone everyone
1660240	1670880	outside of my home i hate you cool that's sort of the paradox to it right like people fans at
1670880	1674320	least feel like they need to be listened to and engaged with and that makes you a better creator
1674320	1678400	but at the same time they like you for the stuff that's coming out of your brain and not necessarily
1678400	1683760	what they're asking for right yeah so it's it's like you can't win either way so you just have
1683760	1690240	to pick one and then stick with it and i pick the one that keeps me out of therapy which which is
1690240	1696240	just doing what comes out of your head yeah and if that entails cutting cutting the feedback loose
1696240	1700880	yeah because it's narcissistic one way or another to keep like looking at what people are saying
1700880	1706000	about you like regardless of the context right like if you're googling yourself if you're getting
1706000	1711680	good or bad it's still like this is all about me right now you need to detach from that and
1711680	1718160	the thing about positive feedback is it may be less effective per capita than negative feedback
1718160	1722720	we all know that negative shit we've talked about this in the podcast if i say oh you're gonna wear
1722720	1727360	that shirt like you're gonna remember that out of the nine things i say i didn't even say anything
1727360	1732400	negative but i just like implied something that's like did you just nag my care bear's metal shirt
1732400	1735680	you're gonna you're gonna remember that next time you're getting dressed doesn't matter if you think
1735680	1739760	that i'm a fashionista it doesn't matter like you'll just be like it'll just stick in your head
1739760	1744080	more than if i told you you were handsome that you look like you're yeah you've been jogging today i
1744080	1749120	don't know what people say when they're being nice that sounds like an insult if you really want to
1749120	1751440	if you really want to fuck somebody up just go hey what's up ankles
1751440	1759920	but uh what but but but here's why am i angles i i did the reason why my ankles
1759920	1764000	positive feedback doesn't stick as much as negative feedback is because positive feedback
1764000	1769680	tends to blend together because liking things is a harmonic thing i i'm not just saying that
1769680	1777920	because i'm harmon i i i have a different view of that i think the reason that negative stuff sticks
1778000	1782480	is because most people have a negative self-image of themselves and when they hear things it validates
1782480	1786160	what they already think about themselves and if you hear something positive it's usually something
1786160	1790240	like well i don't really believe that and you sort of move on you know and then you see the person
1790240	1795760	that's like well you're not funny and then you're like i'm not funny right somebody else sees it too
1795760	1802160	right i see people want to improve i mean we come out here to the to the to la la lands to to to
1802160	1807200	fix whatever happened on the playground we're gonna that bully said i was a fat nerd so i'm
1807200	1812880	gonna go to la and i'm gonna make my fat nerdness powerful and then a bunch of fat nerds say you're
1812880	1817360	powerful and then you and then one fat nerd goes be nice if he was fatter and nerdier
1820720	1825520	and you're like that guy that guy you know you're everyone else you're kind of like excuse me excuse
1825520	1828480	me you know and that's what people are always complaining about it always bums me out that
1828480	1833600	people are like i know you don't respond to positive stuff and yeah i know like oh god i wish
1833680	1837280	i could remember where i heard this probably a radio lab i'm about to do a dumb radio lab
1838320	1845760	regurgitation but i think uh one theory is that the idea is um we hold on to negative stuff more
1845760	1850320	than positive stuff as a survival mechanism from back in the day where you're like out you're a
1850320	1855360	caveman and of all the stuff you learn in a day you have to remember that that mushroom is poison
1855360	1859360	yeah you know that will kill you yeah that's gonna make me last longer yeah yeah totally so that kind
1859360	1864160	of might be why it sticks i like that well that puts a positive spin on why negativity drives us
1865120	1868960	and then it doesn't involve us having to listen to negative people we can because they're not
1868960	1873920	mushrooms they can't kill us they're pieces of shit right and it's also okay to not look at
1873920	1879200	feedback because let's be honest if you guys have experienced this any it's like you scroll
1879200	1883680	so fucking fast the minute this is where what i hate admitting because i hate it when people
1883680	1887520	go oh you don't like people when they support you so i think i'll tell you to go fuck yourself and
1887520	1891600	i say double fuck you fuck you for implying that but they're right that person is right
1892240	1896720	because i need to improve myself there you scroll through shit and you can scan your
1896720	1903120	brain gets so good at recognizing like a solid eloquent paragraph that's supporting you
1903120	1910480	to just fucking you're just like scrolling the better the episode of rick and morty the faster
1910480	1914960	you scroll and you can stop it i was like we're these fucking female writers fucking shit up
1915920	1919520	it's the worst episode ever and you're like fuck you i'm gonna talk to you for three days
1921600	1927680	and you just it's it's it's we're scanning for hatred and alarm and then yeah have you ever
1927680	1932560	heard of harp derp harp derp for anyone who doesn't know it's a it's a chrome extension
1933120	1939040	for google chrome and uh it changes all of youtube comments to some form of harp derp
1939040	1944320	harpy derp like it just goes but if you're curious like if you see you can still see if
1944320	1948240	something has like 700 thumbs up or something like that and then you can click on it and then you'll
1948240	1953040	see the actual it'll turn into the actual comment so what we used to do i can't take credit for this
1953040	1958240	this was our buddy ross he came up with uh emotional mind sweeper which is the game where
1958240	1961520	you like click on harp derp comments until you hit the one that makes you feel sad
1961520	1970320	that's the bomb that's awesome that we should do something like that out of the show like like
1970320	1974720	but then but then but then these assholes will go like i want to be the mind sweep
1975760	1978400	you're not really assholes and thank you for coming
1980400	1985760	uh you're you're the good ones whatever you want to hear whatever whatever motivates you chipmunks
1985760	1993440	jesus christ that's what they respond to yeah happy to be here happy to be here thank you
1994240	1999920	oh i should introduce you guys you guys do this thing on youtube right now um yeah i mean you
1999920	2004000	you you guys have how many how many youtube followers do you have we just hit four million
2004000	2009360	four million and i i'm like extra impressed because i was i went to do your game grumps
2009360	2014240	thing because so we did the show we did it's premiering uh the 30th it's called uh good game
2014240	2021520	good game right uh and and uh it's it's it's an attempt to do uh e-sports sitcom let's
2022400	2029920	fuck it um that that that that that audience isn't picky sick endorsement bro well so
2029920	2033840	actually i i sort of want to uh put this onto you i'm actually curious because i never really
2033840	2037680	heard you talk about it like what what was your interest in it because you sort of championed it
2037680	2042720	it wasn't it was created by michelle maro who pitched it she had worked as a caster forever
2042720	2048320	and she was coming in explaining because i i was like e-sports nothing nothing i don't have nothing
2048320	2052160	every our first eight conversations every time i tried to say uh i i kept saying league of
2052160	2056800	nations instead of league of legends um which is like extra funny because that's like that's
2056800	2063040	that's even even if like uh hoover had been in the room he'd be like oh dad
2063040	2076080	uh league of nations what are you coolage um it's the hoover union now uh anyways the uh
2078080	2084080	what she had uh she described the fact that you know that e-sports is like bigger than this and
2084080	2090720	bigger than that all the statistics and but it was like it was like the idea that it had it was
2090720	2096240	the wild west because of that there was no it's like it's like oh that there's no there's no
2096240	2101040	established league it's all it's all just fucking deadwood you know it's like corporations all
2101040	2107840	jockeying for so everyone wants to be the the company that kind of figures out what e-sports
2107840	2115200	is uh and i found that a fascinating backdrop that's what caught my interest and then i was
2115200	2121280	like let's just do community well we had a good time by then i mean yeah it was awesome no you
2121280	2126320	guys are fucking amazing i like look i i'm sorry if you think i'm like under so i'm not i love that
2126320	2130480	i love the show everyone's gonna watch it it's on the 30th i'm not i just like i just know that
2130480	2135520	gamer audiences are like they're not gonna be like it's so heartwarming i loved it
2137120	2141440	erin and dan like how does the show go i've not seen it so like what is what is the show exactly
2141520	2147360	uh well so the the plot of the show is that dan and i are roommates um we're two 30-something losers
2147360	2154560	yeah um huge stretch when i was when i was like when i was like 12 to 15 i was really good at
2154560	2160080	playing dota which is a popular competitive game dawn of the ancients something like that
2160880	2167520	defense of the defense of the archives um so dinosaurs of the atlanta
2167520	2175040	uh i just my placeholders and every time i was writing something uh so um i was i was a prodigy
2175040	2181360	and then i sort of gave it up um for one reason or another and uh dan sort of my scheming roommate
2181360	2186800	so i guess and uh you saw a thing on tv that said e-sports is this million-dollar industry
2186800	2190320	and knowing that i'm amazing at video games he was like let's start an e-sports team
2190320	2195520	so that's that's where we start off and then we recruit other gamers and they're all like not your
2195520	2201920	typical e-sports uh players because they're they're usually what like 18 year old koreans yeah
2203120	2209360	and now it's topical maybe okay to say you shouldn't be korean
2211600	2214640	if you're out there and you're korean don't
2214640	2216640	i
2224320	2228320	if you hurt me faltering at the end of that uh conclusion it's uh
2228320	2231840	is it it was the moral of the memo i don't think this is yeah i don't think this is going to come
2231840	2238240	out true just i was just connecting linguistic dots from the headlines does anyone know where
2238240	2244960	guam is i don't know where guam is it's it's way far it's it's closer it's much closer to
2244960	2250160	like south korea than it is yeah i was i assumed it sounds like it i mean obviously it's not guam
2250160	2254000	on it sounds like it should be in south america but i assumed it must not be otherwise they
2254000	2259200	wouldn't be talking about it so great good to know i could i can tell you this guam is
2259200	2264400	nowhere near guaramala i thought it wouldn't be i mean i expected it to be except in the dictionary
2264480	2267120	right they're very close
2272080	2280080	what the fuck are we talking about just countries is it just like like alphabetical like we're
2280080	2283280	talking about good game there's game drums and then there's good game and now we're talking about
2283280	2288640	guam yeah are we moving on to the next letter um but you guys are very what's up with guacamole
2288640	2296000	you guys is that an avocado what is it yeah that's what guacamole is
2297600	2302160	i i fell in love with you guys just from like the the first click we had we had we had i got some
2302160	2307040	rick and morty writers uh uh sarah and erica to like uh because they're like more familiar with
2307040	2312800	e-sports and and competitive game stuff they came in and did a great fucking job and uh
2312880	2319440	and i am proud of the show but i i'm like it's it's it's a special note how like charismatic you
2319440	2325120	guys are because you're self-starters you you're just doing this thing like i mean that's a common
2325120	2330160	thing now i guess like every like like top 40 artists are people who just like did it by
2330160	2335440	themselves and all this shit but it's always impressive to see you guys like you didn't go
2335440	2340880	to juliard but you're amazing at being in front of the camera and acting like yourselves which
2340880	2347360	is a huge challenge well i went to juliard for four years yeah no offense to everyone that went
2347360	2355920	to juliard like i mean that's good too uh but but but no you guys are like super like uh i can see
2355920	2362800	why the huge following because you're very genuine uh sincere other synonyms for that um thanks man
2364640	2368320	one of the funniest things in the world that the that the girls played for me
2368320	2374640	was uh it was a clip of you getting so what was the game where it was like unbelievably like you
2374640	2377760	couldn't get past the certain level i know you say that happens all the time but like there was
2377760	2382640	that one it was like rocket oh battle kid battle kid yeah yeah that was a shit show uh if you're
2382640	2385760	looking for highlights that's probably like something you could like youtube anyway it's
2385760	2392080	like listening to uh erin like get so fucking sincerely upset like way past the multiple
2392080	2396800	thresholds of like okay i should keep it together because this isn't good optics but then like
2396880	2401040	getting so fucking mad oh that that was definitely a form of therapy playing that game
2401040	2405440	because i i got more angry than i think i've ever gotten ever in my life ever
2406080	2412320	and it was just a dumb video game so i think i broke something in the in the office i i think
2412320	2417200	that's one thing that is true of all things that are popular on youtube like because it's such a
2417200	2421520	weird some people like this and some people like this and it's all so crazy and different but the
2421520	2426560	one the one common thread is that people like honesty people like super honest reactions
2426560	2431760	whether someone's having a really awesome time or a really shitty time or they're very embarrassed
2431760	2438400	like people are drawn to things that are real you know and i think tv is so much bakeness just
2438400	2444320	honest these days you have to be so fucking good it's insane like the guy who does the micro
2444320	2449280	impressions uh who like who i really want to have on the show and i talked to him at comic-con the
2449280	2455120	he he has a he's like this he does the 50 impressions in a in a minute thing but he
2455120	2459760	his impressions are half a second long each because it's just like kevin spacey if he forgot
2459760	2467840	his straw is that ross yes yeah ross what ross ross mark from walking dead so that's an example
2467840	2471280	of like he's not being himself he's literally being other people but it's like you have to be
2471280	2476400	that on point or for the rest of us yeah you gotta be yourself because there's a long line of like
2476400	2483200	it's a big it's a small corner in a big market whatever the economics yeah but i but speaking
2483200	2488080	of which you i think you guys are like impressive businessmen or is it is it is it is it just you
2488080	2495760	arin like because you you're like you're let me let me take this one uh well they have it's the
2495760	2502720	hair i look like a scumbag it's like it's it's danny can take it he he knows he's got the goods
2502720	2509680	but uh but it's it's it is fascinating to me that like arin you did the you it's the show starts
2509760	2513680	with you playing video games and loving it and then there's a point where you loving it is
2515360	2519520	and you you're a little grumpy about it but but then there's a point where you like
2519520	2526000	kind of hire danny to be the chong to your cheech right yeah but you guys are so amazing
2526000	2530080	together that no one would ever think that from seeing you to interact but you actually kind of
2530080	2535120	were like i'll take that guy well yeah well i originally started with another guy named john
2535120	2542640	and and fuck that guy this guy gets it all right um but he left the show and i was looking for
2542640	2548800	another partner and i i we were writing an album at the time called star bomb and uh we were we
2548800	2554320	were sitting together thank you sir yeah appreciate it that one album you you and the other guy were
2554320	2558720	writing the album or are you it was it was me okay um and then we had that why the other guy left he's
2558720	2568640	like why don't you marry that guy you're doing an album with um well uh okay that's a yes and
2568640	2575840	you can move on okay um so uh writing the album with dan we were naming the the song titles and
2575840	2581760	we were just just busting a gut laughing in my living room for like hours and so i thought if
2581760	2587600	if ever uh this other guy like got sick or something like i would get dan to replace him
2587600	2592480	for a couple episodes and then uh when he left i was like well fucking dan obviously um and then
2592480	2596960	he did it and it was amazing like right off the bat it was like perfect chemistry there are certain
2596960	2601520	friends that just like make you fucking giggle like an idiot like and it just it's always there
2601520	2606080	so that i mean it it's really how we are in our regular life when we're playing games together
2606080	2610560	anyway so i mean there's some shit where we're in between doing episodes that i wish were in
2610560	2617200	episodes because we're just constantly making each other laugh um and also the off-camera uh jokes
2617280	2624800	can be a little more uh dicey yeah yeah um which which also like we wish we could but it's like no
2624800	2630720	it's not gonna go we don't want to cause like but i've been to your office which i can't say
2630720	2635040	where it is because you guys are so popular that someone will show up just to kill themselves in
2635040	2643920	your bathtub like yeah yeah uh that's what they do yeah and and i'm in the famous stories like wow
2643920	2649120	that's that old chestnut you're just you're just a little tyke you're just how can i ask
2649120	2659600	how old you are are you still young enough to me no no how old are both of you is it is it okay to
2659600	2663760	ask i'm 30 i guess that's a weird thing for me to put people as i like i keep i keep doing that
2663760	2667680	to guests and then it's like what if they say no then that's weird yeah it would be weird if
2667680	2672960	they said no yeah then people would be like they must be a mummy so i shouldn't do that
2673200	2678320	no i don't i don't care i'm 38 jesus christ i mean it's it's it's bizarre to think about too
2678320	2684480	because like when i when i started doing game grumps i was 25 and like 25 to 30 is like a
2684480	2691680	huge fucking jump so it's it it sort of makes us worry a little bit like how much longer we have
2691680	2696800	because you know our audience is usually skews a little younger so we're like i don't know if
2696800	2700800	people want to watch like 50 year old dudes playing video games on youtube think about that
2700800	2705360	but i can i kind of can tell you think about that just from walking into your office because
2705360	2711680	i get the sense that you are business-minded from just walking around your office space you have
2711680	2718960	you have people working for you you have you you i have a animation studio and i'm not as organized
2718960	2725920	as what i saw when i went over there like like like i should arguably like feel less chaos like
2725920	2730640	well i think that has a lot to do with our cleaning lady but you guys have like a little
2730640	2734560	indie game that you were just yeah we just really streamed daddy at that dating simulator
2734560	2740640	yeah oh shit oh you guys know about that that's cool we i mean my friend went on an odyssey to
2740640	2746480	find the the comic-con booth and we we got to where it was after it closed and it was a real bummer
2746480	2752400	but that's not your fault at all i'm just trying to say that's how excited we were dick move on
2752400	2757120	our part man it's it's daddy dream date is that what it's called yeah dream dad a dad dating
2757120	2764960	simulator it the acronym goes down uh is dda dds which is dads so we try to keep it so you're
2764960	2769440	the hot new dad that's just moved into a neighborhood and you're trying to seduce other dads
2772160	2778960	and you get available now on steam um what what kind of but what do you have
2778960	2782960	sorry if this gets embarrassing or whatever but i like i like the sincerity and stuff like you
2782960	2787840	said like that is like a it does occur to me that that's a thought that you might have
2787840	2792320	that you're like oh how long can we do this can we do this forever i can't be 50 and play
2792320	2798320	video games so what you must then you have some exit strategy what is it nope
2800960	2808080	just pointless worrying is it is it my hit show on youtube red that's you know it yeah i mean i
2808160	2813120	mean not to get too weird about it but like it is it is a little bit diversification but when it
2813120	2819920	comes to that it's more we have people that are working at the office and from very early on when
2819920	2824960	i started bringing more people on to the to the group my goal was to like get them to a place
2824960	2830880	where they can do their own projects so like sort of use game grumps to catapult other projects off
2830880	2834640	of because that's sort of like the backbone everybody's watching it every day you know
2834720	2840080	nsp has huge visibility his band ninja sex party has huge visibility now because he's in people's
2840080	2846080	lives every day so when he releases a music video people you know we can promote it on the show
2846080	2850960	people know who dan is so they're excited about that so that was sort of what uh dream daddy was
2850960	2855520	was i had the guy who spearheaded it vernan in our office who was our in-house producer
2855520	2860160	just had this idea he was like hey i want to make a dad dating simulator will you will you fund it
2860240	2867360	and i was like you're fired yeah no my response was like fuck yes yeah hell yeah so he just
2867360	2871680	started making it and then eventually it became a thing and that's that's sort of what i hope
2871680	2876800	everyone can be in a position for and then uh so they get to follow their dream projects and then
2876800	2880880	by helping them you know i'm an investor so i can i mean you think exactly like me and so i just
2880880	2887920	want to say like don't depend on their loyalty they'll eat you but i'm doing fine i i i'm very
2887920	2892240	happy i'm just a workaholic and i'm like yeah like like you're like when i hear you guys talk
2892240	2902000	about that stuff i like i i it comforts me and i i have affection for you guys oh dan dan we've
2902000	2908480	said i just want to i just i just want to die in his least pain possible you know i thought
2908480	2914080	you were gonna say in our arms hey that didn't you just talk about like for five minutes how
2914080	2917600	you wanted to blow your brains out in a bathtub yeah and then he talked about how you guys have
2917600	2923360	a bathtub oh are you the kid and how your fans want to kill themselves in your bathtub remember
2923360	2929040	you're connecting these dots like guess who's coming guess who's coming to beta test danny
2929040	2935440	dream date it after it's alpha released wait did you say danny dream date daddy
2938080	2943280	the hell yeah when we were back there uh because we have a little monitor where we can watch you
2943280	2946960	on stage we were just sitting there looking at each other and i was just thinking like
2947600	2954400	this is a hard act to follow because man it was it was heated it was heated dude no i got i went
2954400	2960960	all louis black like i was like is that how it usually is i well i don't know no no no no
2963200	2966880	no not usually i think it was just it was a rough day for everybody i mean it was fucking heated
2966880	2972240	down it was like it was like it was like there was a muscle knot in america today a fucking dude
2972240	2978000	someone died a lady died who cares what the fucking gender was i i i i someone died at least
2978000	2982720	one person a bunch of people there's fucking like and the most disheartening thing was like within
2982720	2990960	seconds memes going from one american to another american like with graphic imagery of that
2990960	2996480	horrific horrible thing an american killing an american and then an american with on their
2996480	3002320	laptop putting fucking impact font bullshit on it and sending it to another american as if to say
3003200	3008240	human life means nothing to me america means nothing to me oh yeah i think that's a fucking
3008240	3015840	threshold sincerely sure yeah uh we've gotten beyond glib i'm 15 and i haven't evolved a
3015840	3020480	conscience yet that like i think i'll throw you a black and white photo that's maybe unsightly and
3020480	3025280	oh yeah puts fear into you because i think the young should eat the old this was just like
3025280	3030080	30 year olds terrorizing 30 year olds with actual blood that just had been spilt and
3030080	3037360	probably wasn't cold yet right but i'm fine i mean we're in the bluest of blue states i'll be
3037360	3044720	i'll be like you know i just i just want you know i i i want to get i do i i want to kick
3044720	3051360	i want to get killed by a nazi like i mean even though start doing game let's bring him out
3055280	3058720	yeah that's your nazi introduction
3061360	3067200	yeah it's randal the nazi he's from chattanuga tennessee put your hands together
3069040	3072320	if you wanted to die wouldn't you wouldn't you choose it wouldn't you choose
3072320	3080480	assassination by nazi over colon cancer are those my only choices and specifically you have to die
3080480	3085040	of colon cancer while everyone around you is dying by nazi then i'm for sure i'm like kill
3085600	3089120	so you don't want to be around for this you're getting a glimpse of the better one right like
3089120	3093440	right in front you're like i should have chose the nazi look at how much fun everyone's having
3094400	3102320	wait wait i could have chose nazi jesus christ i think nazis need to understand is that they like
3102320	3107680	they're not gonna it's not gonna be like you go to your 7-eleven the next day and it's an american
3107680	3113360	7-eleven and the slim gyms are cheaper like it's there's it's gonna be torn down and there's gonna
3113360	3120560	be a boot warehouse there your country's gonna suck when it's taken over by a bunch of
3120560	3124800	people that suck so bad that they couldn't even do anything without their privilege
3124800	3130160	all right anyways all right well if you think if you think it's bad now and you shouldn't
3130160	3133920	i think if you keep talking you might get killed by a nazi sooner than you think well it's it's
3133920	3139360	taken less than what i've already said in the past for people that have had less it's of course i'm
3139360	3144240	gonna get killed by nazi i don't think you have the guts to actually dare a nazi to kill you dan

3913360	3922800	getting socks dirty like people think it's brave okay my next three questions aren't blind people
3922800	3927680	questions they're des questions that's true that's very true treat them like a human being for once
3929360	3933040	are you in a relationship that brings i'm not currently i'm currently single
3933040	3937600	ladies yeah i don't know i don't know i don't know how to wink or men
3937600	3946960	is there a is there a blind community there is um there they all um don't know how to spell
3946960	3952160	because they can't read uh but there is a blind community out there but i can spell
3953600	3959440	is the blind community because obviously the jet we've the we we we the uh uh whatever you call us
3959520	3967040	the uh the seeing community we call you sidy down with sidy sidy down with sidy down with sidy
3967040	3975200	down with sidy right you can fucking see shit des i fuck sidy des des you're coming back immediately
3975200	3982960	yes uh i i have and it's not because you're blind which is i hope not i don't know i have
3982960	3987840	i have a drunk blind guy question for you okay uh you you don't like like in the movies like you
3987840	3992160	touch like the blind person touches somebody's face to see like you know like yeah yeah do you
3992160	4001360	ever abuse that and like go too far what are your titties butts and just like oh yeah you kind of
4001360	4005440	touch the titties and if they're they're kind of not what you expect you're like oh my god these
4005440	4010960	titties these are pecs at that point you're like well let's let's work on this so it's possible to
4010960	4018400	be a a bad person and blind at the same time i'll tell you brother it's entirely possible
4018400	4023120	and it's happened on many an occasion you know but i want to the reason i ask is there a blind
4023120	4026560	community because i want to know about dating too like what's what if and tell me when i'm
4026560	4030560	praying too much but i want to know about your sex life if you're blind since birth like what's
4030560	4037680	asked me were a couple dating actually dating's hard man you know before i found reggie um
4037760	4044480	the guy to my left i would i would be on a tinder and i would go on on dates dude just on
4044480	4050160	tinder just based on one picture that i uploaded and the girl would be like you know you never
4050160	4061680	told me in your profile that you were mexican and i would and you're like i would be like neither
4061680	4070720	did my neither did my parents and so it's just a big shock
4073760	4078720	so there's one stereotype we're confirming which is that when you lose one site your comedic timing
4078720	4086000	gets enhanced you're like the charitable of podcast guests just just like smell and taste
4086000	4091920	it gets a lot better yeah he's been practicing i've been working on it but but but you're so
4091920	4095760	funny we don't know what the truth is now are you do you don't do you do i mean how does the how
4095760	4101040	does the dating work if you're born blind like who how do you meet if you're if you're desperate
4101040	4106320	enough for pussy it works that's sweet that's just what it is like she she does you had him
4106320	4114800	and you lost him you had him i mean that's your guys fault for offering fear free beer so
4116480	4123120	thank you dan appreciate it i tip a dollar for each one does that is that face touching thing a
4123120	4128800	thing it's not a thing but like you can make it a thing when you're drunk enough you know like
4128800	4134640	it's not a real thing but if i if i'm really wanting to like communicate something do uh
4134640	4142960	do congenitally blind uh people have a uh people who lost sight later in life is there a
4143520	4148560	uh uh bump boundary between those uh how bump boundary like you can read that shit like it's
4148560	4153760	braille or what well i yeah like yeah i get you talked to him for five minutes and you're like
4153760	4159200	dude you could see for five years couldn't you no i was it well i'm just wondering because like
4159200	4165440	with the deaf community there's like you know oh you got cochlear implants or you lost your hearing
4165440	4169280	later after you were born and then there's people who were born deaf and etc just wondering like
4169280	4179040	if you guys if you guys if you guys do the blind from birth do they refer to uh people who lost
4179040	4184800	their sight in childhood people who lost their sight in middle age in different ways um i wish
4184800	4190880	do you like if it was the bloods and the crypts like you lost your sight later in life you fucking
4190880	4198640	poser right you fucking fake i've actually i've actually tried to describe like i've tried to
4198640	4204960	describe colors to des and it's impossible i add i would love to you for you to give a world like
4204960	4210400	describing colors like my big question dan is uh you created like my favorite cartoon of all time
4210960	4218000	and i have no idea what the creator of my favorite cartoon looks like oh so why don't you give me a
4218000	4232480	description dan touch his face what the fuck does he look like touch his dick well he can touch
4232480	4239360	touch his dick what i think the challenge is more like give him a why he's blind he won't know
4241440	4245120	you can tell me whatever you want dude i'll believe it i mean do you
4245680	4255760	uh i i look like i actually told him you you look alike oh well but how does he know what he looks

4260080	4265360	dance i des and dan i have a pitch dan what if we get i'll pick two people out of the audience to
4265360	4272000	come up here and do a lineup and he has to pick by touch by touching your faces to see which one
4272560	4275040	yes

4467840	4477280	you assholes this is fine it'll be fun they're gonna hate it anyway because the blind are hateful
4477360	4479440	right there's one thing we've learned
4481600	4486720	i heard a rumor that's why they're blind they're being they're being punished
4489680	4491760	what are you gonna do uh what are you a doctor
4495600	4498720	i can't prove me wrong wow

4510800	4511600	human oatmeal
4514320	4518480	so you don't like oatmeal i think church was saying like i said like yeah not in my humanity
4518480	4523920	no i said at church like like trump has the brain power of half an avocado and she's like
4523920	4528080	yeah but that's that insults half an avocado yeah like you can't compare him to anything
4528080	4533440	without insulting the thing you're comparing him to half an avocado wouldn't say best regards
4533520	4539920	what did he say sorry about the person that died and best regards to their family what do you
4539920	4550960	fuck what do you do best regards best wishes all right uh spencer toodles i feel like we uh
4550960	4556160	we are poised to maybe get into some action on this on this round of dnd right now we can only hope
4558400	4563280	are you ready to rock for a little uh recap here yeah all right let's do this damn thing
4563440	4577680	when we last met what uh jeez christ what what happened um you had just scared off the the the
4577680	4585200	i was almost revealed what it was the hooded figure it was headed to the the church and
4585200	4591920	you followed it there where you met pachins who was asleep and you woke him up um he was
4591920	4597600	amenable to your cause quickly but yet you argued with him as if he was not on your side
4598640	4604560	i'd say you tried to convince him a good three or four times past the close to help you guys out
4605120	4614160	um you you planned an infiltration as diarrhea junior snuck through through a hallway and the
4614160	4621040	rest of you climbed up on the roof diarrhea junior went into the bedrooms and saw a sleeping person
4621120	4627120	and then you guys followed him there were horses that were great oh boy those horses
4628560	4634640	after meeting in the bedrooms you await to the the courtyard to plan your plan
4634640	4642000	with pachins also who had showed up all right there it is sorry that was no good okay so yeah
4642000	4649360	so we did a little break and i went off to go to the library you guys had quite i think you were
4649440	4652720	pitching a lot of ideas and no one had actually wanted us to split up
4654160	4660080	carlos carlos uh as as you're running off where are you going again remind me i don't think you're
4660080	4666240	running off yet this is me pachins and i'm yelling i should be quiet all right hey guys
4666240	4675440	i drew you this map chris can you get the map oh whoa oh yes oh damn this is a map i drew by
4675440	4680960	memory of the priory see on the right there's that that cluttered pathway that's where diarrhea
4680960	4688160	junior snuck in there's the interior courtyard and yeah where's the clutter this is the worst
4688160	4697120	night to make a oh cluttered pathway now we have visuals where are the six doors up here
4697920	4704960	oh oh okay well des if you're if you're listening we don't get it either it's nothing it's just
4704960	4712160	it's not that helpful it's scribbles yeah this whole game is scribbles all right so now i was
4712160	4720800	going to go into the to the library to find the prior all right right yeah you're going east west
4720800	4724400	east right now you're in the courtyard the only door is to the north of you
4725760	4729120	i go to i i go into the uh the north door oh my god
4729680	4737120	you see a door it doesn't it doesn't seem heavily boarded you don't see the nails protruding through
4737120	4744240	the door i i push the door oh or pull is it a norman door does it make sense run that by me
4744240	4747280	one more time well this door is it that looked like you should pull what you should push and
4747280	4754080	it's kind of confusing i called oh yeah it's one of those all right you do the wrong one
4759680	4765120	it's a one digit combination and you you can you can hack it then i do the other one
4766000	4773200	all right um you pull the door open it just opens okay you can see that there are boards
4773200	4778400	kind of reinforcing it but largely it just opens on its hinges so where where am i i'm at the
4778400	4783520	library you enter the sanctuary this is the most church looking part of the church you know church
4783520	4789760	pews that are in rows there's kind of a center space that's a hallway and towards the front of
4789760	4797920	the the pews is a kind of raised platform where the podium stands the podium is where uh is where
4797920	4802560	you know the priest would stand to give a sermon and behind him you can see a kind of window
4803360	4809600	and through the window you can see the the glowing light of flames um yeah it's like a
4809600	4815280	symbol of the church so behind behind the podium is flames also to the left the podium is uh is a
4815280	4823520	door okay i i uh i go through that door you don't got to use the map i just want to know where i am
4823520	4829280	on it but you're in the courtyard that's where you guys had convened where's the you mean the
4829280	4836720	fenced yard we're by the horses yeah okay okay okay i don't think it's labeled courtyard in there

4991840	4997760	you we look around the library all right you go to the library it's uh it's not a giant library
4997760	5003200	it it's only got kind of wall bookshelves that don't go very high i'd say they go about seven
5003200	5009600	feet tall so it's not like a sprawling book apocalypse it's just a pretty small library
5009600	5014080	there's a large table in the center and it has a couple books on the table like you know someone
5014080	5019680	has been studying a little bit and there's some uh other larger tables for kind of you know more
5019680	5024800	people to sit at and they seem relatively clean there's also the stairway that goes up i poke
5024800	5031760	through uh the stack of books that's the largest at the smallest table okay one one is uh
5031760	5038000	improvised wards and the other is trap making 101 and the other is what to do when your church is
5038000	5050080	under attack track making yeah how to make a track give me a break hack hmm what to do when
5050080	5061280	your church is under attack i open the cover it's the read the entire thing okay um there's not
5061280	5067040	how much time do you want to spend on that because i want to go the entire book okay no i'm kidding
5067040	5073120	i'm kidding he's not a fast i i walk up that staircase i'm gonna i'm gonna take i want to
5073120	5077680	take that book and put it in my backpack what to do when your church is under attack yeah okay
5077680	5082240	great i'm storing all right you should write do we have can i have a can i have a pencil okay can
5082240	5088000	we give you two seconds sorry you're gonna add that book to your inventory yeah because i think
5088000	5092240	honestly i have a feeling i'm not coming in was that a best seller i mean
5094560	5101440	are we always under attack that that book had to be published not all cool things are popular
5101440	5108800	i i walk up that staircase but you go up the staircase what's your perception
5115120	5123680	10 okay wait what okay it says plus 10 i'll buy it for now it's you want you want me to pass this
5123680	5131200	no i just think it must be mistaken but it might not be it's three five two it says 10 i believe
5131200	5142960	it okay i i don't believe it anyway no i believe it i really do this says four no no i'm kidding i'm
5142960	5151680	kidding yeah no that's 10 all right oh man you see who was right he was right you see that one of the
5151680	5157920	one of the what do you call it like the level the part you step on of the stair like the the
5158080	5166480	horizontal starry part uh-huh of the stair is the step right the step the top platform of the step
5167360	5173520	of three of the stairs is really loose the subatomic portion of a set of stairs
5176720	5181840	so i i noticed that one of these stairs is not an actual stair three of the stairs are like loose
5181840	5187680	as if they're like they're kind of up higher than it would normally be it looks like they've been
5187760	5195120	tampered with all right i uh i investigate that stair all right it looks like uh it looks like it
5195120	5201760	was pulled up and then a bunch of marbles uh were put under it and then it was put back so oh so i
5201760	5207920	could have slipped and broke my fucking ass or you know any number of other things i i and you
5207920	5213440	still can't i pull that that step off the marbles all right reveal what's underneath marbles
5213440	5221040	one of the marbles is gold one the marbles is gold oh yeah i take that motherfucker
5222080	5226160	you put it in my little knapsack yeah i got a gold marble
5227840	5234160	jesus this guy's really into marbles he loves them i continue up the staircase all right you do
5234160	5239760	that using my 10 perception wait what does he do with the is it like a section of three stairs
5239760	5245680	yeah what's he doing with it like what do you i i i'm proving that did somebody home
5245680	5250240	alone with this fucking staircase but i know but you know you're stepping like from my perspective
5250240	5254400	all i watched is you started going upstairs then you stopped stared at the middle of the stairs
5254400	5259200	then lifted three of the stairs up there's marbles underneath you took one and now you're
5259200	5265840	going up the stairs i presume with the three stairs in tow and so i just i just took the
5265840	5272400	step part of that stair off and put it aside okay how is that trap gonna work i have so many
5272400	5277680	questions for the person who set this yeah guys i think i was supposed to step on this and the
5277680	5281440	marbles would shoot the stair from underneath me and i would go crashing to my where would the
5281440	5294240	stairs go up up that's that's a ghostbusters joke oh they go up i i can mean can i move the stairs
5294480	5300320	they're already moved right he moved all right so we're just looking at like a platform of marbles
5300320	5306160	no it's just it's just stairs that like have uh like a shitty part that's not meant to be stepped
5306160	5310560	on it was supposed to make me slip and fall right and i but the marbles are under the stairs
5310560	5314720	they're under the top there was a board with marbles and if you step on you whoa if i could
5314720	5318720	go smash and you you hurt yourself just pretend it makes sense like they're like ball bearings so
5319520	5325680	yeah can i take can i take all oh sure all the marbles yeah yeah what i wanted those marbles
5325680	5331200	are the marbles heavy they're marble are they better than my stones i use in my slingshot uh
5331200	5336480	they're comparable oh but i have i have a gold one yeah i investigate that gold marble is there
5336480	5340720	anything special besides it's being it's being gold it's light and in your hand when you move
5340720	5346240	it around you can feel it's kind of sloshing slightly sloshing all right i think you should
5346560	5351840	i'm adding a bunch of marbles to my inventory nice all right but i also think there was probably
5351840	5358080	an element to this that was meant to be an alarm right i think this gold marble is probably the
5358080	5362640	kind of like like it's probably like a like a ninja smoke bomb or something like that like
5362640	5368720	it's like it looks special like it's got it's got a sloshy what flash bomb yeah like a ninja
5368720	5374080	okay all right there's a ninja in the audience who wants wants to make sure you get your terms
5374160	5378400	right yeah but worst ninja ever they're not ninja smoke bombs they're flash bombs
5380960	5386880	tired of this shit all right guys i think i've defeated at least one of the booby traps in the
5386880	5390800	staircase let's proceed up the staircase together all right the rest of the staircase is uneventful
5390800	5398080	you get to the top the door is locked okay i i use the marbles on the door no i'm kidding i'm
5398080	5407600	kidding are any of you guys uh no fuck i don't have any lock picks uh lock picking skills i mean
5407600	5413840	this is just like weird weird word i lightly i lightly knock on the door i lightly go
5414640	5419600	you hear nothing not a stir not a nothing not nothing i think you should light it on fire
5421440	5427600	is there a window nearby uh no this is like a narrow hallway it's uh it's pretty dark and stuff
5427600	5434400	none of you guys can shrink or turn into a ghost or anything i can light things on fire
5436000	5442640	millennials all right wait so someone just kicked the door in like this what let's let's just kick
5442640	5446480	the well okay well let's have a plan if we're gonna do that like in theory there's an old guy
5446480	5451520	sleeping behind there that is or isn't a floating vampire that just got home are we looking for the
5451520	5456560	the event that's happening that could you know involve the corpse of that child and
5456560	5465120	that happens later right what well don't ask me we heard it well where's pageants oh uh pageants
5466000	5473760	pageants hey guys hey fucking this guy just sneaks up on us every time i was in the library
5473760	5479360	hey pageants do you have keys for this door uh no maybe there's some somewhere else i'll go look
5479840	5488720	okay yes please go do that i found some keys holy shit he's like the he's like the paper clip
5488720	5497440	in microsoft word i keep patches oh patches do my taxes open the door for us patches all right
5497440	5503920	he opens the door um there's no one inside it's a very bare room there's like a single dresser with
5503920	5509920	a mirror on it and um on the dresser is like a bowl of water and there's a small table in a chair
5509920	5515840	that's kind of like a desk it has a candle the candle is low but it's not lit and there's no one
5515840	5521360	in the bed the bed's not even made i go tumble out of the bed like like like lay backwards like
5521360	5528320	like i'm like i put the candle out and drink the water the candles out but you uh drink the water
5528320	5534640	it tastes like hands it tastes like what hands hands wash their hands in that shit man
5536160	5539200	you like that hand water what the fuck was i thinking
5542080	5546720	i rolled around in the bed giggling you gotta make your own fun around here
5548320	5553440	he drank hand water i love water so much i hope you love hands
5553440	5559280	split the diff motherfucker i examined the room some more is that is there all there is to be
5559280	5563600	seen in that room yeah it seems like he doesn't actually keep anything more than just the clothes
5563600	5569840	and the dresser in here like not even any writing tools or like uh like books or anything i feel
5569840	5573840	the bed to see if it's warm and see if anybody's been there recently it looks like dan's been in
5576560	5580320	yeah the bed hasn't been in otherwise though okay i'll tell you what though
5580320	5590960	under the bed is where i look and next go for it i drape myself over the edge of the bed while
5590960	5596640	still laying on it i'm being playful i'm like a little kitty cat i'm like elizabeth shoe in the
5596640	5601760	cold open of adventures of babysitting i'm just like just feeling sprightly what do you when did
5601760	5608400	they get a groan one of the most amazing performances in cinematic history i i i drape my head and uh
5608400	5614480	i look under the bed you don't see anything guys i think we're in the wrong room then i go like
5614480	5620080	this in keeping with my elizabeth shoe persona in the 80s in general when i don't see anything
5620080	5627200	i go and i do one of those things where you where the lower lip goes up outside the upper lip and
5627200	5632240	you exhale and so your your pert bangs kind of like right flicker right
5632240	5637280	right i'm trying i'm hoping des knows what i'm talking about
5638960	5643120	like i said it's like a it was an 80s thing like girls would do it they like
5643120	5647760	my homework's gone and it would be really cute like their bangs would go all right carlos
5647760	5652960	gj let's go back downstairs this room seems clear i saw an interesting looking flame at the back of
5652960	5658880	the sanctuary we should go investigate that maybe what they're already upstairs we are upstairs
5659200	5664720	that's only the bottom floor plan the upstairs floors aren't depicted on the map
5669120	5671840	well one thing's for sure my audience is immersed
5674800	5680560	i think the doors in this room are just the way we came in right wait we can we look this is not
5680560	5689920	look this is not this is not the best suggestion but we there are sleeping people right we could like
5691680	5697680	interrogate one about where this thing is happening yeah last episode steve found a sleeping person
5697680	5704400	right with the chest jeff looked him in the face and he was asleep we saw him before but he didn't
5704400	5708960	nobody of importance that we knew of should we just we should just let's go back down real quick
5708960	5711840	since since we're right here because we're right just we go down the stairs we're right in the
5711840	5716880	sanctuary let's go investigate that flame real real fast okay well this guy just loves fire
5717760	5724560	i know it's my thing i i i we can take a look at it all right yeah yeah and if it's a dead end we
5724560	5729760	go we go wake up sleepy town we're gonna wake up sleepy town no matter what all right let's check
5729760	5734160	out the fire all right so you go back into the sanctuary you can see there's a door behind the
5734160	5739760	podium where the guy can go um like like the guy what do you call it like the priest might after
5739760	5744720	the thing go like after a sermon walk back there above the door there's like i said a large kind
5744720	5749920	of open window that kind of just displays the fire almost like it's supposed to showcase and
5749920	5755440	frame the fire for people sitting in the sanctuary um so yeah there's a door to this fire room so
5755440	5762560	to speak i tried the door all right it just opens it's what did you say it just opens what are you
5762560	5770960	what the door opens okay i'm picturing it's kind of like that's like the background behind letterman
5770960	5776480	right it's like it's like a yeah yeah like a diorama yeah okay you open the door and inside you
5776480	5782480	see a giant great uh brazier of flame it's a giant red or you know normal color flame it's not like
5782480	5787520	a silver flame but this is like a symbol that's in some of the nicer churches just kind of to
5787520	5792160	remind everyone that it's the church of the silver flame and here's a flame next to it you can see
5792160	5799280	some uh what do you call it kind of like urns or basins uh that are full of presumably holy water
5800240	5808160	and uh dan out of the corner of your eye you can see you can see uh one of the walls is fucked up
5809120	5815680	there's a fucked up wall over there yeah upon closer inspection you see that the wall has a
5815680	5822800	thin outline as if it might be a secret door dude what am i i'm like batman yeah you're the only
5822800	5829200	one that sees it i am like arkham arkham mode i don't even need to try okay it's it's because
5829200	5833920	uh do i understand like why am i perceiving it is because of uh the metagaming answer is because
5834000	5840320	you rolled a 19 oh you're just oh sometimes you're rolling for us and not asking us for stuff often
5846720	5851040	you're in the zone you're in the zone right now well i find so i'm gonna be like gentlemen
5853680	5857600	it would appear to be a featureless room emphasis on the appear
5858320	5866240	here one question i always ask myself in religion is how much is showmanship and how much is
5867040	5874640	illusion and i and i and i lean on the door like i i just want to be like dr who you know yeah
5876160	5881680	you lean on the door it you can see the door kind of move as if it closes so it's like a secret
5881680	5885680	door that was slightly open and now it kind of closes so it's kind of perfectly hidden now
5885680	5889440	but you know what you gentlemen don't know is that i just leaned on a secret door
5890480	5901040	and closed it okay can you open it again can i open it again i'll find out
5903040	5907760	can i well it's like a wall it's like a brick kind of stone wall if you're trying to open a
5907760	5912320	secret door on a brick stone wall how would you do it what are you trying to do gentlemen
5915680	5919840	query how would you open a wall
5922000	5926880	that was already a jar but you leaned on it and closed it and now you're trying to be fancy pants
5926880	5931840	about it maybe you leaned on the wrong side you leaned on the closing side and not the opening
5931920	5936880	side sure you go around to the opening side no no like what are you my dog
5939120	5944400	like like like maybe you had a push on one part and then it opens and you
5945040	5949280	i go like this like it's like a medicine cabinet where you hopefully it's like has one of those
5949280	5955920	magma oh yeah no it is yeah it's like i play yeah and it goes back to how open it was before oh
5955920	5962000	nice huh let's let's open it let's open it all the way now or maybe let's ask ourselves this
5962000	5968960	and i lean on it and close it god damn it all right i close it maybe what we need is a master
5968960	5982240	of doors oh you found one click it door master i i whisper all right i'm sorry i'm sorry i feel
5982240	5989120	like we i had some business i open the door all right you open the door you pull the door open
5989120	5996800	and you feel some resistance but you pull it open and you you hear a snap um there's there's a string
5996800	6003680	that you see snap as you hold the door open and it it uh what does it do it like it sets off a
6003680	6011520	minor chain reaction where like a rock we set off a rube goldberg yeah a rock that was attached to
6011520	6017920	the string falls on like a water skin and the water skin squirts a line of oil that kind of
6017920	6024880	blasts towards you guys pinches apparel what all right goonies reference

6104880	6110960	leave it on a cliff here please don't show us that this underground space is kind of like a
6111280	6116720	cellar the walls are rough cut stone and the floors are made of the same smooth floor tiles
6116720	6122160	used in the church barrels line the walls and on the far side of the room in this flickering light
6122160	6129120	you can see several rogue figures huddled around a table the person furthest from you holds a light
6129120	6135040	an object that you can't see for the intense glow it emits and the others cower back in fear
6135040	6142400	revealing the table and on the table is a messy pile of corpses like uh two or three mutilated
6142400	6149040	bodies just ripped apart and just placed in like a nest of of gore and violence in various stages
6149040	6156400	of decay there's other corpses elsewhere he uh lowers lowers the the glowing object and you
6156400	6163120	can smell burning as everything starts to melt on the table and and expand like marshmallows in a
6163120	6169200	campfire bubbling and smoking and gooping together and then everyone descends on the
6169200	6175680	goop and they start bathing in it and eating it and their bodies begin to warp and change into
6175680	6186320	weird shape shape shifting monsters sense motive um cliffhanger cliffhanger
