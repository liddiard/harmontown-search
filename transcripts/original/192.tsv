0	14120	Yeah, bang that hair, Dave Kline.
14120	26120	Get up on stage and do that right now for the homos, man.
27120	32120	Oh, shit, he's drunk.
32120	35120	Yeah.
35120	38120	From Hollywood, California.
38120	44120	Downtown comics.
44120	49120	Climate Challenge is now in session.
49120	53120	That's it for Dave Kline, everybody.
57120	60120	Parker.
60120	71120	Let's bring out Rob Schwab, everybody.
71120	74120	Rob, are you in this, Rob Schwab?
86120	100120	It's going to be a good show.
100120	105120	The stage is fully vacuumed.
105120	109120	Let's bring out the mayor, Mr. Dan Hunter.
116120	131120	That's how you start a show.
131120	134120	Start a show.
134120	136120	All right.
136120	139120	Dan, doesn't give it tonight as losing a Spencer.
139120	142120	They can give us gaining a maniac.
142120	145120	Spencer couldn't be here tonight.
145120	151120	Yeah, same page club.
151120	159120	And I had a free evening.
159120	161120	Hello, Dan.
161120	163120	We have guests in the control room.
163120	165120	Hello.
165120	170120	You came out and they're professional people of their own merit.
170120	172120	Birds of a feather.
172120	178120	Who had to turn to me to ask, am I supposed to go out with a bit?
178120	183120	And I had to say to grown men and women, no, don't, no.
183120	187120	That's not anything to measure yourself by.
187120	190120	No, that's not what our show is.
190120	197120	Yeah, you'd be ripping me off.
197120	199120	All right, don't start.
199120	202120	Did you see Dave Klein banging his head with the hair?
202120	203120	Yes.
203120	204120	That was amazing.
204120	205120	I did.
205120	208120	And also, people I think could probably say with more expertise than us that that was
208120	210120	some awesome head banging.
210120	211120	It seemed legit.
211120	214120	Yeah, we have guests tonight that could weigh in on that.
214120	215120	Yeah.
215120	218120	I don't have a lot to talk about before we start meeting our new friends.
218120	221120	How was your week?
221120	223120	I haven't seen you in a while, Dan.
223120	224120	How was your week?
224120	226120	How's your week?
226120	228120	Do you have any anecdotes?
228120	234120	If you thought Rob would be less disruptive sitting over at that table, he's only going
234120	236120	to try harder over there.
236120	238120	I'm trying to keep the show going.
238120	242120	Dan, do you have any anecdotes or anything?
242120	243120	Anecdotes?
243120	245120	Do you have an anecdote?
245120	252120	What happened?
252120	253120	The kids love them.
253120	257120	I saw that Zootopia.
257120	259120	You see that Zootopia?
259120	260120	Yeah.
260120	261120	Yeah.
261120	263120	People like that Zootopia, Dan.
263120	265120	Have you seen that Zootopia?
265120	266120	No.
266120	270120	The whole city's animals.
270120	272120	It's crazy.
272120	277120	Everyone, even all the dogs, everybody's an animal.
277120	279120	The dogs are animals, too?
279120	281120	The dogs are animals.
281120	282120	The cops are rabbits.
282120	283120	It's crazy.
283120	285120	You've got to check out the Zootopia.
285120	286120	I'm telling you.
286120	287120	Zootopia.
287120	291120	It's really bringing in the bucks, too.
291120	294120	China loves it.
294120	302120	You should make a Zootopia.
302120	303120	All right.
303120	305120	Hi, Jeff.
305120	306120	How you doing, Rob?
306120	307120	I'm doing okay.
307120	308120	What's wrong?
308120	309120	You seem a little down on that response.
309120	311120	Oh, thanks for asking, Jeff.
311120	314120	Only, Jeff?
314120	317120	Well, I shit in the box, finally.
317120	319120	Oh, well.
319120	320120	You shit in the box?
320120	321120	Yeah.
321120	323120	Did I miss an episode?
323120	324120	Oh, yeah.
324120	326120	You weren't in that episode.
326120	328120	What box did you shit in?
328120	332120	Oh, the one that's next to the toilet.
332120	335120	You became a Zootopia.
335120	336120	You became a cat person.
336120	337120	Yes, yeah.
337120	338120	You're pooping in a box now.
338120	339120	What do you mean you pooped in a box?
339120	341120	Speaking of boxes, someone's handing you Dan Harmon a box.
341120	344120	I had to give a stool sample to...
344120	345120	Oh, I did hear that.
345120	346120	Yeah, yeah.
346120	349120	And then I have to FedEx it to Texas.
349120	354120	I was alarmed to find out that they want you to FedEx your poop.
354120	360120	It's better than driving it there.
360120	361120	All right.
361120	364120	What do you got there, a box?
364120	367120	It's full of Rob shit.
367120	369120	Hey, you got a FedEx that to Texas?
369120	376120	Someone in the front row handed Dan a very mysterious large black box.
376120	377120	All right.
377120	379120	So a lot of you ladies are thinking...
379120	380120	What is it?
380120	381120	I can't see.
381120	383120	Do I need to look like that in order to be a Harmentown listener?
383120	385120	No, you don't.
385120	388120	There's something wrong with her and not you.
388120	391120	First of all, she's an artificial construct.
391120	393120	I can't see it.
393120	397120	Second of all, she's probably racist.
397120	405120	She's certainly the beneficiary of systemic racism.
405120	408120	Oga.
408120	409120	I can't see what you're...
409120	411120	What the fuck is in the box?
411120	414120	It's fucking liquor. It's liquor.
414120	418120	Well, turn it around so everyone can see it.
418120	421120	Kind of tell them like an eight-year-old.
421120	422120	Turn it around.
422120	424120	Did you hand this to me?
424120	426120	Can you come...
426120	428120	You're willing...
428120	431120	It should be your choice because...
431120	433120	He's good to go.
433120	436120	You're wearing a very exciting outfit right now.
436120	439120	That's why I wanted them to know that it was his choice to come up.
439120	443120	I want curtains made out of everything you're wearing.
443120	445120	These were from Walmart.
445120	446120	For real?
446120	447120	Yeah.
447120	448120	Well done.
448120	454120	This is Variety, and I asked them to translate the size to a men's size.
454120	456120	And she's told me, and I'm like,
456120	458120	well, do you think they'll have that size over there?
458120	461120	And she said, those pants aren't going anywhere.
461120	463120	So I bought the pants.
463120	464120	Yeah, all right.
464120	467120	So this stuff, it's clearly very sexist.
467120	468120	I have asked...
468120	469120	Still haven't seen it.
469120	471120	I found out about this company.
471120	472120	They're from Germany.
472120	480120	They produce high-end liquor that they then pour over the model depicted body
480120	483120	and then put it into the bottle.
483120	485120	Put it into the bottle.
485120	487120	Yeah.
487120	489120	Wow.
489120	493120	You come a long way, baby.
493120	494120	I mean, we could do shots.
494120	496120	We could wait till later.
496120	501120	These shots come pre-body shot in.
501120	506120	I don't know if they do a whole vat or if they do it bottle for bottle, but...
506120	507120	Do you think they really do it?
507120	510120	Is there an oversight committee that makes sure that actually happens?
510120	514120	Every article I've ever read said this company claims
514120	515120	and then says what they claim.
515120	520120	So there's no validity to the rumors that these women are in windowless rooms
520120	522120	glued to the floor by their own shit?
522120	524120	She said.
524120	527120	Each one of them says outright, yes.
527120	529120	It was a wonderful opportunity for me.
529120	532120	Well, yeah. That's what chickens say.
532120	535120	When you talk to them, oh, do you like making McNugget?
535120	537120	They're like, fuck.
537120	543120	As for the racial thing, every variety is done with a woman of a different ethnicity.
543120	547120	So I believe the rum was a black woman and then...
547120	548120	See, that's racist.
548120	552120	Well, I mean, it's our modern definition of racist because it acknowledges...
552120	554120	But at least it's inclusive.
554120	557120	If it was all white women...
558120	559120	It is...
563120	566120	If you're old enough, you realize he's right.
566120	570120	In Don Draper's time, it'd be like, oh, the bourbon is a brunette.
570120	571120	Yeah.
571120	575120	The G actually stands for gentlemen.
575120	576120	So this is like a gentleman...
576120	578120	She, like, protects them or...?
578120	581120	The G spirits, it stands for gentlemen.
581120	584120	So it's like a gentleman's club in a bottle.
585120	590120	And then they put the picture of the girl on the bottle so that no matter how drunk you get,
590120	594120	you never have to forget what an asshole you were for buying that vodka.
594120	599120	So, Dan, I'm assuming you have vodka that was poured off a redhead?
599120	601120	Am I guessing correctly there?
601120	603120	And that would be like a Negroni?
605120	607120	She's clearly Icelandic or...
607120	612120	I know you don't represent the company, but I'd like to pitch an alternate name for their product.
613120	615120	The opposite of Purell?
616120	618120	Just the opposite of it?
618120	619120	Yeah.
619120	622120	Just a bottle of stuff that comes with...
622120	623120	Three germs.
623120	624120	Yeah.
624120	626120	All right, well, thank you. What's your name?
626120	629120	Absolutely. Dan Meyer and Handelman. I've always wanted to meet you guys.
629120	630120	Wow.
630120	631120	My dad was a...
631120	632120	So you're an assassin.
632120	637120	No, no. My dad was a comedian from the 60s named Stanley Meyer and Handelman.
637120	639120	Well, John Wilkes Booth was an actor.
640120	642120	But three names means you're going to shoot somebody.
642120	646120	I am no actor, sir. I am no actor, I can promise.
646120	649120	Okay. Well, John Meyer Handelman?
649120	650120	Dan Meyer and Handelman.
650120	651120	Dan Meyer Handelman.
651120	652120	You guys are awesome.
652120	654120	Let's hear it for Dan Meyer and Handelman, everybody.
655120	656120	I assume...
656120	657120	Wow.
658120	661120	We already have done too much show.
661120	663120	It's already been too much entertainment.
663120	665120	I'm kind of grateful because I came out...
666120	670120	I was staying in the green room. I'm writing a little bit of a line.
670120	672120	I've been working all day. I stayed up all night.
672120	675120	So hard. You've got to slow down, man.
676120	678120	You're going to fucking trigger me.
680120	682120	We're going to bring out our...
682120	684120	Vacuum cleaner.
687120	688120	I wanted to address...
688120	690120	You were saying you were writing a line today.
690120	692120	It's one of those nights where I'm like...
693120	697120	I stayed up all night because I'm trying to work on my book
697120	700120	and I found out last week, because of the episode,
700120	703120	I got the forwarded emails that the publishers are listening.
703120	705120	Uh-oh.
705120	707120	So when I'm joking about not working on the book,
707120	711120	it's like, yeah, oh, it sounds like you at least know the book is due.
712120	713120	For real?
713120	717120	So I'm just like, okay, if you're listening at double day,
717120	719120	I stayed up all night.
719120	722120	And if this show sucks, it's on you.
724120	726120	I'm sure the book will be great.
727120	728120	But...
728120	730120	You need one of them ghost writers.
730120	732120	You need to get a ghost writer to take care of it, Dan.
732120	734120	I hear that's what they do.
734120	735120	Ghosts can't write.
735120	737120	Yeah. No, no, no. I heard it.
737120	739120	I heard it in a book.
741120	742120	The...
744120	746120	I peaked with the vacuum cleaner.
750120	751120	He's gonna...
751120	753120	Rob, I don't know if you're aware of this,
753120	755120	where Spencer sits, where you're sitting right now,
755120	757120	Dan never faces that way.
757120	758120	His back will be too the entire night.
758120	759120	I know.
759120	763120	And Dan, Rob is going to be throwing darts at you the entire time.
763120	764120	Whatever. It doesn't...
764120	765120	It's just...
765120	767120	You gotta cool it, guys.
767120	770120	What I'm trying to tell you is that I stayed up all night.
770120	771120	I've been working all day.
771120	775120	I shot Great Minds today with Paul F. Tompkins, who's wonderful.
776120	777120	And...
778120	779120	I...
779120	782120	Around four o'clock, I start drinking on that set,
782120	783120	because I'm like...
783120	785120	So I'm just riding the line.
785120	788120	This isn't gonna be like the Chicago show, but...
788120	790120	Like, I'm on the bubble.
790120	792120	So we're at the mercy of our guests being...
792120	794120	Like you might descend into some sort of haze or madness?
794120	795120	No, I just might...
795120	796120	I'm not as facile.
796120	798120	I'm not like...
798120	800120	Like, it's good that that guy was a...
800120	801120	He was a good guy.
801120	802120	He took the mic.
802120	804120	He could have, like, started stabbing people.
805120	806120	But it's like...
806120	807120	We're cool.
807120	808120	I'm just saying, like...
808120	812120	This is one of those nights when Uncle Dan maybe needs a little...
812120	814120	He's gonna lean on you a little bit.
814120	816120	And lean on tonight's guests.
816120	818120	So I only wanted to say...
818120	820120	You may notice me talking a little slower.
820120	822120	It's sounding a little bit more like a game show host,
822120	826120	because I'm overcompensating for my brain's desire to slur
826120	827120	and go like...
827120	829120	What is that about the Packers?
830120	834120	I just wanted to say a couple of things before we bring out our friends.
835120	837120	I have to say...
837120	840120	One thing that amazes me about you, among your many skills and talents...
840120	841120	I know what you're gonna say.
841120	845120	This is what amazes people about Denzel Washington's character in the movie Flight.
845120	846120	And it shouldn't amaze you.
846120	848120	It should concern you.
848120	849120	You never slur.
849120	852120	It's called highly functional alcoholism.
852120	854120	It's not funny.
854120	855120	I didn't say it was funny.
855120	857120	I thought it was amazing.
857120	858120	It's not a superpower.
858120	860120	It's a kryptonite.
866120	868120	Yeah.
868120	870120	So...
870120	874120	Last week I told you about the Avengers Academy game.
874120	876120	Most of you tweeted me,
876120	879120	this information is readily available to anyone under 30,
879120	881120	who just googled it.
881120	884120	The kid that I was talking about, who I was like,
884120	886120	kid, come on, take it easy.
886120	890120	That was Dave Franco, who plays Tony Stark in that Avengers video game.
891120	893120	And Black Widow, who I...
893120	895120	That was my friend, Alison Brie.
895120	898120	That's Avengers Academy game.
898120	900120	It's star-studded.
900120	903120	Run, don't walk to the App Store.
903120	905120	You can enjoy it at a whole new level now.
905120	906120	Dave Franco?
906120	907120	Dave Franco.
907120	908120	Yeah, come on.
908120	912120	Did he contact you upset?
912120	913120	No!
913120	916120	You came down pretty hard on Tony Stark.
916120	917120	You came down pretty hard.
917120	918120	No, no.
918120	919120	People just tweeted me...
919120	921120	It was actually in the Rick and Morty writers room
921120	924120	because I was talking about this game and I was saying the same spiel
924120	926120	and then somebody said, that's Dave Franco.
926120	928120	And I was like, oops.
928120	932120	Because I don't want no beef with no Franco gang.
932120	934120	These guys are like...
934120	936120	They're the new bald ones.
936120	938120	Yeah, they're the new bald ones.
938120	941120	You don't want to miss with that.
941120	943120	There's another Franco in the chamber.
943120	947120	The bald ones got so strong that they sprouted Adam,
947120	949120	he was not even a real bald one.
949120	952120	He's just like a rapey creep who went off.
952120	955120	Isn't that the gamer gate guy?
955120	957120	He's not even a real bald one, right?
957120	959120	Who cares?
959120	960120	You guys are like...
960120	963120	Dan, what are these mystery bottles of alcohol here?
963120	964120	What is this?
964120	965120	That's for our next guest.
965120	966120	Oh, okay.
966120	967120	Let's bring her out.
967120	968120	Well, I have to get back to my...
968120	970120	Vamp for a while while I pour myself a drink so I can...
970120	973120	Hey, why don't you give me one too?
973120	976120	Why don't you give me one too while you're up there?
976120	979120	Jeffrey, could you please give me one?
979120	980120	I'd like one too.
980120	983120	I got a whole table.
983120	985120	And I got a whole table here.
985120	989120	The other thing I wanted to say was that our friend...
989120	993120	Some of you in L.A., we go to the drawing room afterward.
993120	997120	Some of you may have encountered our friend Mario,
997120	1000120	the bartender there, who I've quoted in the past.
1000120	1004120	I've quoted him like one of his funny jokes I think he was passing on to me
1004120	1008120	because we were talking about race and things.
1008120	1015120	And he said, you know, the only thing you could call a white person
1015120	1018120	that will really offend them is racist.
1018120	1021120	He told it better.
1021120	1026120	He passed away a couple of nights ago,
1026120	1033120	and he had already survived a total cardiac arrest
1033120	1036120	and was hanging in there and stuff.
1036120	1038120	Now he's gone.
1038120	1041120	And I don't know, why do I bring it up to make the podcast sad?
1041120	1043120	I don't know.
1043120	1046120	For anybody that's ever met him, some of you must have.
1046120	1049120	I've gone to the drawing room after our show.
1049120	1051120	He's the large Cuban fellow.
1051120	1054120	To know him was to at least like him.
1054120	1057120	And to know him a little bit better was to absolutely love him.
1057120	1061120	And so he left this giant hole in a lot of people's lives.
1061120	1063120	I didn't realize how much that was going to affect me.
1063120	1065120	I found out about it and I was really sad.
1065120	1068120	And the next day, I was like, oh, I've known him more than half my life.
1068120	1072120	And he's always been a source of happiness and grieving.
1072120	1076120	If you care to donate a dollar or 50 cents or a nickel or whatever,
1076120	1079120	just so that he can have a nice funeral
1079120	1081120	because he went through a lot of medical expenses.
1081120	1083120	If you go to my Facebook page, there's a little GoFundMe
1083120	1085120	if you want to drop a nickel.
1085120	1087120	Have you ever met him?
1087120	1092120	He bought me so many free drinks that I really owe him in many folds.
1092120	1096120	My favorite memory of him besides that joke was just
1096120	1101120	the bathroom, the men's room at the drawing room is unlike anything you've ever...
1101120	1104120	It's like an episode of Locked Up Abroad.
1104120	1109120	And I remember coming in one day and he had this boyish smile on his face
1109120	1112120	and he's like, go in the bathroom.
1112120	1117120	And I went in the bathroom and I was like, oh, there was like a plate of stainless steel
1117120	1120120	mounted above the sink.
1120120	1126120	And I came out and he's like, it's a mirror, no one can break.
1126120	1132120	He had gotten out a Time Life book and he cared about...
1132120	1134120	He was like one of the Lost Boys.
1134120	1137120	He's like, I'm going to make Wendy proud.
1138120	1144120	That bathroom was, everyone goes in there to prove God doesn't exist.
1144120	1148120	I don't know how it happened when it was decided.
1148120	1153120	God is dead in that bathroom and Mario cared enough.
1153120	1156120	There's a species of insect that I think only lives in that bathroom.
1156120	1160120	That was Dino's theory is that when you go to the drawing room, men's room,
1160120	1166120	and you're peeing at the urinal, there's this mysterious, not quite gnats, but not quite fly.
1167120	1172120	A bug that seems designed to just get in your face while you're trying to pee,
1172120	1180120	inadvertently causing your pee to go everywhere, which seems to be what they live on.
1180120	1183120	So Dino thought he had figured this biosphere out,
1183120	1188120	that this is like a species of insect that only lives in the drawing room bathroom.
1188120	1192120	And that might be the reason why.
1192120	1194120	He kicked Vince Vaughn out of there one time.
1194120	1196120	Vince Vaughn was being a complete ass.
1196120	1200120	And Mario kicking Vince Vaughn out of there with just such subtlety.
1200120	1201120	It was so nice.
1201120	1204120	And if he really hated you, he would just go, bro, you got to go, man.
1204120	1205120	Time to go.
1205120	1209120	And then if someone was like, fuck you, he would just reach behind the refrigerator
1209120	1211120	and there was a seven iron golf club there.
1211120	1214120	And he would just slowly come around the bar.
1214120	1217120	The whole bar would clear out. It was great.
1217120	1223120	Well, like anyone who wasn't, you know, 97 yards away, I don't know what I said.
1223120	1228120	I thought I was going to like riff a golf joke.
1228120	1230120	You can only hit a seven iron 97 yard.
1230120	1231120	I don't know, man.
1231120	1235120	I caddied when I was like, what did Vince Vaughn do?
1235120	1240120	He left.
1240120	1242120	No, you know, you mean why did he get kicked out?
1242120	1247120	Yeah, he was he was in a shit.
1247120	1250120	I wanted to riff a bad Vince Vaughn movie.
1250120	1252120	He got kicked out for Clay pigeons.
1252120	1254120	Yeah, whatever. All right.
1254120	1259120	OK, our next guest is toured across colleges and clubs or whatever.
1259120	1265120	She's a she's a she's a new friend of mine as of her podcast girl, a guy which I was on.
1265120	1271120	She's a she's an old friend of Jeff's because she hosted hosts.
1271120	1274120	She's currently hosting the ABC who's line.
1274120	1275120	CW.
1275120	1276120	Oh, it's CW now.
1276120	1277120	Yeah.
1277120	1278120	See, my confusion is more.
1278120	1279120	Season four.
1279120	1280120	All right.
1280120	1290120	Well, let's let's get to the bottom of Aisha Tyler, everybody.
1290120	1299120	We're going to get to the bottom of you.
1299120	1300120	Exciting.
1300120	1301120	Would you like?
1301120	1302120	Very exciting.
1302120	1308120	Would you like vodka dripped lovingly over a Caucasian avatar?
1308120	1313120	I had a nickel for every time I drank vodka that previously run over a Caucasian pussy.
1313120	1318120	I swear to God I'd have millions of dollars.
1318120	1323120	They should just call this unknown epithelials vodka because that's.
1323120	1324120	And then look at her.
1324120	1328120	She's sensationally fucking intellectual.
1328120	1331120	I wonder where she went to college.
1331120	1337120	If they poured a white guy, you if they bottled a drink or a cocktail or some sort of concussion off of your body.
1338120	1341120	Black thunder.
1341120	1343120	Actually, I brought my own alcohol with me.
1343120	1345120	You ask, like, what are these mystery bottles?
1345120	1346120	It looks like moonshine.
1346120	1347120	It isn't moonshine.
1347120	1348120	Actually, this is coincidence.
1348120	1350120	I really just brought it because I know you guys are alcoholics.
1350120	1352120	But I brought my own.
1352120	1356120	I have my own line of cocktails coming out late in the year and it's pre-made cocktails.
1356120	1362120	I know you guys are like men who don't know how to run like a washing machine or start your car.
1362120	1363120	Very true.
1363120	1366120	So you're just drinking straight vodka and a glass because what do I do?
1366120	1368120	So I brought you.
1368120	1370120	I have a line of cocktails coming out called Curtain Stone.
1370120	1371120	This is an old fashioned in a bottle.
1371120	1373120	All you do is pour it into a glass and it's a drink.
1373120	1374120	No way.
1374120	1376120	You're going to save so much time.
1376120	1379120	And this is a gin old fashioned and also just pour it out.
1379120	1381120	A gin old fashioned.
1381120	1385120	The principle of the old fashioned is just spirits, bitters and something sweet.
1385120	1389120	I don't want to be high maintenance, but can I get this trickled off of Eva Mendez?
1389120	1390120	I will.
1393120	1395120	I'm a bit of a spickler.
1395120	1398120	Eva actually is doing my Manhattan.
1398120	1399120	Racist.
1399120	1405120	But just so you know, I masturbated and then stirred my fingers in this before I put it in the bottle.
1405120	1406120	Sold.
1406120	1408120	It's delicious.
1409120	1414120	Infused with the juices of my personal joy, ladies and gentlemen.
1416120	1421120	Every sip is like sex with a black woman, confusing and delightful.
1422120	1425120	You don't know if you got it right, but it's OK because he leave.
1425120	1427120	I'll get it right by my damn self.
1427120	1428120	All right.
1429120	1433120	And you always know whether whoever you're watching should go into that house.
1433120	1434120	Yes, exactly.
1434120	1435120	I do.
1438120	1439120	That just the end of it.
1439120	1441120	Oh, it's OK, baby.
1441120	1442120	It was fine.
1442120	1443120	You're just you're adorable.
1443120	1445120	You got good credit, baby.
1445120	1446120	Just leave some money.
1446120	1448120	Nobody cares if you was good or you was bad.
1449120	1453120	Why is having sex with me like having sex with the mom from what's happening now?
1453120	1454120	Yeah.
1455120	1458120	Oh, baby, slap that ass.
1458120	1459120	I'm making some corn pone.
1459120	1460120	Why am I a racist?
1461120	1463120	Your show makes people racist, Dan.
1463120	1464120	I don't you.
1464120	1468120	I don't care if the woman is white, black or whatever.
1468120	1473120	I would like just once in my life to be having sex with a woman of any ethnicity.
1473120	1474120	And she'd me too.
1475120	1477120	I thought I thought he was finished.
1477120	1478120	I thought he was finished.
1478120	1483120	Just a woman of any ethnicity period or on her period.
1483120	1484120	What's it like?
1484120	1485120	What's it like having sex?
1485120	1486120	What are vaginas like?
1486120	1487120	Awesome.
1488120	1489120	Why is it?
1489120	1490120	Having them, having them, being in them.
1490120	1491120	Both awesome.
1492120	1496120	Do you think having sex with a black woman is complicated?
1496120	1498120	Do you think it is complicated?
1498120	1501120	It's just it's just it's the same pussy.
1501120	1504120	I mean, that's the thing that people have this idea that like I'm going to have sex
1504120	1508120	or something exotic and then magically unicorns are going to come out of my ass
1508120	1513120	or my credit score is going to go up or down depending.
1513120	1516120	Or all of a sudden I'm going to understand my iPhone because I had sex with somebody
1516120	1517120	from the Asian subcontinent.
1517120	1520120	No, vagina is vagina and dick is dick.
1520120	1521120	And sorry about that.
1521120	1524120	Talk to God if you believe in him or science like me.
1528120	1531120	Since we're talking about sex and since race came up and I don't see the world
1531120	1534120	through this lens, I had no idea you were black until we had this conversation.
1534120	1535120	Right?
1535120	1536120	It's exciting, isn't it, Dan?
1536120	1537120	But I have a black friend now.
1537120	1538120	Enjoy.
1539120	1540120	One that you didn't cast on your show.
1540120	1541120	Hi.
1542120	1544120	I like you for you, Dan.
1552120	1555120	Tell me, you tell me to step back and step forward whenever.
1555120	1556120	I'm listening.
1556120	1557120	This is a safe place.
1557120	1558120	Where's the safe place?
1559120	1562120	I already know this is going to go terribly wrong, you guys.
1562120	1563120	This will all be ready.
1563120	1566120	Everybody avert your eyes in three, two...
1569120	1570120	What does your hair feel like?
1570120	1571120	No, no.
1574120	1576120	I wanted to yes and the...
1579120	1581120	I didn't want to let you down.
1582120	1589120	I had this thesis recently where I was like...
1590120	1592120	You know how porn is like...
1592120	1593120	Oh my God.
1594120	1595120	It's too late, guys.
1595120	1596120	It's too late.
1596120	1597120	Christ.
1597120	1598120	When we're talking...
1601120	1602120	You have this porn world where...
1602120	1603120	Pull out, goose.
1603120	1604120	Pull out.
1609120	1610120	Where everything gets...
1610120	1613120	Dan, Rob is now match-gaming you over here.
1615120	1616120	All right, fine.
1616120	1617120	You love this, Rob.
1617120	1618120	No, I don't.
1618120	1619120	You're free by now.
1619120	1620120	I don't love it.
1620120	1621120	All right.
1621120	1623120	By the way, the worst vacuum job I've ever seen.
1623120	1628120	There's glitter and human remains, a finger.
1628120	1629120	All right.
1629120	1630120	Ask the question.
1630120	1631120	I'm curious.
1631120	1632120	Let's talk about porn tropes.
1632120	1633120	I love this stuff.
1633120	1636120	Well, I wanted to talk about race in porn because at first glance...
1636120	1639120	Here's the thing about porn in general that I've been...
1639120	1640120	This is my new thing.
1640120	1641120	Post divorce.
1641120	1642120	Yes.
1642120	1643120	Because I'm just like...
1643120	1644120	Okay, unapologetic porn.
1644120	1646120	It's a free divorce and you're watching it.
1646120	1647120	Just post divorce.
1647120	1648120	You can talk about it.
1648120	1649120	Yeah, kind of.
1649120	1650120	Yeah, pretty much.
1650120	1651120	Out of respect to...
1651120	1652120	Yeah.
1652120	1653120	To the dead.
1656120	1657120	But it was...
1657120	1659120	You know, I've sort of become...
1659120	1664120	Not obsessed, but just sort of fascinated with this thing that...
1664120	1667120	You know, the porn industry represents all of this money.
1667120	1671120	We have this, like, bed of lava underneath us that is all this sexuality.
1671120	1672120	Yes.
1672120	1673120	Like, if you compare...
1673120	1680120	You could name anything, video games, Matt Damon, anything that you thought was worth
1680120	1681120	money.
1681120	1682120	Right.
1682120	1687120	Nothing would compare to the general swath of the fact that forever, ever since we've
1687120	1691120	been able to make porn, we've always had this, like, sea of porn underneath our society.
1691120	1693120	But then everything that's above that sea, right?
1693120	1698120	If, like, that's under, like, a little kind of a hardened, cooled crust of magma.
1698120	1701120	Above that, everything is still suffused with that energy, right?
1701120	1702120	Yes.
1702120	1704120	Like, almost everything we find valuable, whether it is pornographic or non-pornographic,
1704120	1707120	is also shot through with pornographic value, right?
1707120	1710120	Matt Damon, everybody wants to fuck Matt Damon.
1710120	1711120	Ladies want to fuck him.
1711120	1712120	Gay guys want to fuck him.
1712120	1713120	Straight guys want to fuck him.
1713120	1715120	And hopefully they turn into him after they fuck him.
1715120	1717120	Everybody wants to...
1717120	1718120	You know what I mean?
1718120	1719120	Everything in culture is suffused with sex.
1719120	1720120	Of course, yes.
1720120	1721120	Absolutely, yes.
1721120	1724120	You can't escape the core of the earth is, like, affecting everything.
1724120	1725120	If you shut that off, we'd know.
1725120	1726120	Yes.
1726120	1727120	If you shut porn off, we'd know.
1727120	1728120	Yes.
1728120	1729120	You'd know.
1729120	1732120	More to say, porn is an expression of the core of each of us.
1732120	1733120	It's all collectively.
1733120	1734120	Yes.
1734120	1735120	We regard it as the sewer.
1735120	1737120	So we treat the performers in it like shit.
1737120	1739120	The industry is not regulated.
1739120	1740120	Right.
1740120	1741120	It doesn't...
1741120	1746120	No one knows where to put the camera.
1746120	1747120	It's always like...
1747120	1750120	A lot of eye-line problems.
1750120	1752120	A lot of eye-line problems.
1752120	1753120	I think they're lining up.
1753120	1755120	They're like, guys, we're going to line up this shot.
1755120	1758120	But I'm worried that when we push in on her vulva, we're jumping the line.
1758120	1759120	Are we jumping the line?
1759120	1760120	Yeah.
1760120	1762120	We were looking right to left, and now we're left to right.
1762120	1765120	Is this going to work for the double penetration?
1765120	1767120	I think we need to move.
1767120	1770120	When you are doing her from behind, look camera left.
1770120	1772120	Otherwise, the whole thing is wrecked, guys.
1772120	1774120	Guys, we got continuity problems.
1774120	1776120	This guy's balls are all over the place.
1776120	1777120	Yeah.
1777120	1778120	Come on.
1778120	1779120	One shot, they're up.
1779120	1780120	One shot, they're down.
1780120	1785120	Guys, it makes no linear sense.
1785120	1793120	It is absolutely unmistakable that there is no grace or diplomacy in the handling of the
1793120	1798120	concept of ethnic phenotyping in pornography.
1798120	1802120	Your intellectualism is dazzling.
1802120	1808120	But this is an industry where you type in redhead, babysitter, scuba diver.
1808120	1811120	You type in a really specific shit.
1811120	1816120	And so just as in normal casting of network television, whereas I've encountered where
1816120	1823120	it's like you have to steer around the fact that, well, we categorize people and all this
1823120	1825120	stuff, so you better believe we do in porn.
1825120	1828120	So you are typing who knows who you are.
1828120	1829120	People are typing.
1829120	1834120	And therefore, porn is being made where it's like you don't want the stuff representing
1834120	1837120	your species consciousness of race on one hand.
1837120	1842120	But on the other hand, I was trying to make the point of a previous episode where it's
1842120	1853120	like how much more racist is porn than politics, religion, whatever the fuck you call the fact
1853120	1861120	that the disproportionate incarceration, like actual racism versus just like this dopey
1861120	1865120	river of like two black dudes, one white chick.
1865120	1868120	And then it's like the guys come in and go, did someone order a black guy?
1868120	1870120	And the woman's like, no way.
1870120	1872120	And she's like, whoa, they're so big.
1872120	1874120	And he's like, that's because they're black.
1874120	1877120	And she's like, I learned a lesson.
1877120	1882120	And you're watching and you're going, I don't want anyone to think that this is how I think
1882120	1883120	about race, but at the same time.
1883120	1886120	I don't want anybody to think that this is how I think about race.
1886120	1891120	And in a minute, I'll feel super guilty about it.
1891120	1896120	Because sexuality transcends politeness, diplomacy, all these things.
1896120	1898120	Well, maybe the word isn't transcend.
1898120	1902120	Maybe the word is subsumes or subverts, right?
1902120	1905120	Because you're at your basis when you're consuming porn.
1905120	1909120	And porn in its creation is a very base expression.
1909120	1910120	Sorry, vivid.
1910120	1912120	You're not making art.
1912120	1919120	And so people are looking for satisfaction of their basis instincts, of their basis inclinations.
1919120	1922120	And they're also looking for those things to be satisfied in a very narrow window.
1922120	1928120	No one's masturbating all afternoon unless they want like bed sores and the end of a relationship.
1928120	1934120	And stereotypes will not be conquered during porn.
1934120	1935120	No, no, no, no.
1935120	1937120	No one is really trying to learn anything.
1937120	1941120	Anything you walk in the door with will only be magnified.
1941120	1943120	It probably won't be conquered.
1943120	1949120	Except in the sense maybe that you're like, well, I'm being a little bit of a hypocrite
1949120	1954120	if I am, for instance, like being an actively racist person in the outside world.
1954120	1955120	But I don't know.
1955120	1956120	I see both sides of the issue.
1956120	1957120	But why is that question, though?
1957120	1960120	Because you're just trying to get permission to look at more two black dudes, one white chick porn.
1960120	1961120	Is that why you're here?
1961120	1962120	Oh, no.
1962120	1963120	I have permission.
1963120	1965120	Well, if you didn't before, you do now.
1966120	1967120	No, no.
1967120	1971120	I was just very curious about because I talked to our friend, Demorge, who like he had a
1971120	1974120	very interesting counterpoint, which was like, but I can't tell.
1974120	1977120	I mean, obviously, there's no binary answer to this.
1977120	1986120	But as far as I could, I could like parse his very, very like almost densely like a different
1986120	1987120	perspective point.
1987120	1994120	It was like, yeah, but in all those moments when race is allowed to just be a thing like
1994120	1999120	a Ben and Jerry's flavor in those moments, the problems being reinforced and blah, blah,
1999120	2000120	blah.
2000120	2001120	Like, well, that's yes.
2001120	2003120	If I'm getting him right about that, then OK, yes.
2003120	2008120	But that's why I say, OK, yeah, porn is not the place where racism is going to be solved.
2008120	2013120	However, ironically, I think it is less racist in porn than it is in the Oval Office, that
2013120	2020120	it is in church, that it is anywhere you would go where people would say we're because it's
2020120	2023120	like just dopey people going, yeah, but at the end of the day, I come three times, I
2023120	2024120	get paid three hundred dollars.
2024120	2025120	Right.
2025120	2026120	Right.
2026120	2027120	They can't afford $100.
2027120	2028120	You're paying $300?
2028120	2029120	$300?
2029120	2034120	Rob, don't get distracted by the bookkeeping here.
2034120	2035120	I'm done.
2035120	2040120	But are you talking about, before we move on to headier topics, are you saying that you
2040120	2045120	feel like porn is more racist in its construct in casting or porn is more racist in the way
2045120	2046120	that we perceive it?
2046120	2051120	Because I would actually argue, and it's just came to me now, that porn may be both most
2051120	2056120	racist and least racist in the way that we consume it because we may treat people in
2056120	2059120	one way in the real world the way we interact with them, we hire them, we don't hire them,
2059120	2061120	we associate with the people that we want to associate with.
2061120	2065120	But I bet you there are a lot of white guys out there and all their friends are white
2065120	2069120	and they've never had sex with a black girl, but that's the only porn they watch is a white
2069120	2073120	guy railing the shit out of a black girl with his micropenis.
2073120	2078120	And it might even be part and parcel, it might even feed back into his hatred.
2078120	2087120	Or it might just, it's interesting, maybe he subscribes to the idea that all black men
2087120	2090120	are virile, large penis.
2090120	2092120	And I guess that's the line.
2092120	2095120	I absolutely 100% agree with that.
2095120	2098120	And their penises are huge, like baby's arms, every single one.
2098120	2100120	Prehensile baby's arms.
2100120	2104120	Every black man can pick up a cup of coffee with his penis.
2105120	2108120	They're actually exactly like baby's arms, they have elbows.
2108120	2111120	Completely articulated the penis.
2111120	2115120	But they only spend one way, which is why most of them can't be quarterbacks.
2118120	2120120	They'll all end up in the manager's office eventually.
2120120	2122120	Google it.
2122120	2128120	Yes, I think same page, I think the interesting thing is it's like where you draw.
2128120	2132120	I guess I was just doing an academic distinction where it's like, you know, for all intents
2132120	2135120	and purposes, it's like the things you're seeing on screen.
2135120	2140120	When you're on the set, I find it hard to imagine when the stuff I'm watching, I'm like,
2140120	2146120	I don't think that anyone is being made to feel less than human on that set.
2146120	2149120	Aside from the fact that they're in porn.
2149120	2151120	Aside from the fact that there's a stranger's hand inside their anus.
2151120	2154120	Other than that, they feel totally human and validated.
2154120	2157120	I am validating you now, do you feel validated?
2157120	2159120	Your anus is immaculate.
2159120	2165120	But then when you have a conversation about media as a phantom signal that's not an industry
2165120	2169120	and not a community of people, then of course, 100% agree.
2169120	2176120	Of course, it will only feed back if you're jerking off to the idea of gangbang this.
2176120	2178120	It's not going to make you not a misogynist.
2178120	2181120	There's a million things that porn reinforces that make you hate all of humanity,
2181120	2185120	not based on color, just based on, you know, that we're all like these terrible, you know,
2185120	2187120	creatures in pants, you know what I mean?
2187120	2189120	Yeah, porn will make you hate yourself.
2189120	2191120	It doesn't matter what color you are.
2191120	2195120	This episode is brought to you by Pornhub, which I actually love what they're doing.
2195120	2197120	And our good friends over there...
2197120	2200120	They're really like doing a lot of great stuff over there.
2200120	2204120	They're like a VR character category.
2204120	2207120	They're really breaking ground.
2207120	2210120	Here's something that they're doing that I actually...
2210120	2212120	Yeah, the comment section is really great.
2212120	2215120	The press releases, on St. Patrick's Day, they'll go,
2215120	2219120	here's how many people searched for leprechaun porn.
2219120	2222120	It's subtly, it does what the Kinsey...
2222120	2224120	Yeah, the Kinsey study, yeah, with the spectrum.
2224120	2226120	It just is a subtle reminder.
2226120	2228120	It just goes, hey, everybody's a freak.
2228120	2231120	Yeah, that's it. No matter how weird you are, there's a guy weirder than you.
2231120	2233120	On April Fool's Day, they changed their front page to Cornhub,
2233120	2236120	and it was all just cobs of corn.
2236120	2238120	Classic.
2238120	2241120	And the captions were like, hot buttered cob,
2241120	2244120	getting it from both sides from a napkin.
2244120	2246120	And there was a guy who was like, finally...
2246120	2251120	Yeah, there was one guy who was like, oh fuck, it's April Fool's, no!
2251120	2253120	But it was, you know, to approach it...
2253120	2256120	Classic Pornhub.
2256120	2260120	I would say, I don't want to open this pedal and enclose it, but I would say...
2260120	2263120	It's been open for hours, Dan.
2263120	2268120	The porn shares with Christianity, or any religion...
2268120	2270120	What's going to happen?
2270120	2272120	Let him talk. Let him talk.
2272120	2276120	The fact that it could use more smart, proud people involved in it.
2276120	2278120	Okay, all right, let's bring out some more friends.
2278120	2280120	Just leave that there.
2280120	2284120	It gets a bad rap because everyone's like, I don't know, I'm not involved with that.
2284120	2286120	We were going to talk about workaholism before...
2286120	2287120	Yes.
2287120	2289120	So how long have we been working in porn?
2289120	2291120	So long.
2292120	2296120	You work all the time. You're on 900 shows, you write books, you do everything.
2296120	2298120	You're all over the...
2298120	2303120	The thing about it is, I think when people say, I'm busy, or I'm a workaholic,
2303120	2307120	it's funny to people, or even if you make the joke about being a high-functioning alcoholic,
2307120	2311120	people think it's really cute, and then you're like, no, I have a real problem,
2311120	2314120	and I need help, like I do.
2314120	2318120	It's clear to me that I could use several meetings about my work...
2318120	2322120	I've just started to approach that in therapy where I'm like, I left the drinking thing behind.
2322120	2324120	I finally have enough...
2324120	2326120	Tell me how that went for you.
2326120	2329120	I have enough faith in a therapist because she's like,
2329120	2331120	look, if you want to drink for the rest of your life, go ahead, you pay me.
2331120	2333120	She's like, can I come to her, please?
2333120	2337120	Yeah, I'll give you her number. She sees everybody, half the people in this room.
2337120	2343120	But she was like, but you have yet to acknowledge your workaholism,
2343120	2345120	and that was like a real threshold for me,
2345120	2347120	because I would always go...
2347120	2351120	She wouldn't say you're a workaholic, that's conversation, it's not going to go anywhere.
2351120	2353120	She's like, you...
2353120	2355120	She would say this stuff, and I would go like,
2355120	2359120	are you implying I'm a workaholic because I'm not getting enough done?
2359120	2362120	Right, yeah, because the thing about a workaholic is,
2362120	2366120	in your construct, not only are you never busy enough,
2366120	2368120	you're never effective enough.
2368120	2370120	That's like the little, like the arroboros, little like,
2370120	2372120	you're only as valuable as what you do.
2372120	2374120	There's always going to be more work.
2374120	2376120	There's always going to be more work.
2376120	2378120	Shut up, mom. Here's the thing.
2379120	2381120	We're all going to die, right?
2382120	2384120	We're all going to die.
2388120	2391120	And that affects people differently, right?
2391120	2393120	Some people think we're all going to die, so what's the point?
2393120	2395120	We're all going to die, so let me get wasted.
2395120	2397120	My particular approach is we're all going to die,
2397120	2401120	so I should be doing more shit, like I'm not doing enough shit.
2401120	2403120	When I'm lying on my deathbed, I'll be like,
2403120	2406120	why didn't I do all this shit? I already did half the shit.
2406120	2410120	I think that's a really simple response to I'm going to die.
2410120	2412120	Makes perfect sense, right? Yeah.
2412120	2415120	Do more shit. Grow your hair really long and bang it around.
2415120	2417120	Fucking, you're on fire, you.
2417120	2419120	And you stole my outfit.
2419120	2424120	Just real quick, one of the women in either hair or makeup,
2424120	2426120	but who's lying?
2426120	2428120	I just walked out of the room, and I was like,
2428120	2430120	we're just talking about stuff on podcasts,
2430120	2432120	and I was like, I'd love to get Aisha out,
2432120	2435120	and they're like, don't you dare ask her to do another thing.
2435120	2437120	Because I also have shitty boundaries, too.
2437120	2439120	I'll show, I mean, I want to do stuff.
2439120	2440120	Of course I'll show up.
2440120	2444120	She does enough stuff, like give her some rough.
2444120	2446120	The most frightening thing to me,
2446120	2448120	and I don't know if this is this way for either of you,
2448120	2451120	is looking at my calendar and having a free day.
2451120	2453120	Most people are like, I'm in it.
2453120	2455120	To me, it's like running your tongue
2455120	2457120	over a place where a tooth's supposed to be.
2457120	2460120	It's like fucking orgasm, but also I'm dying.
2460120	2462120	Yeah, yeah.
2462120	2463120	What the fuck?
2463120	2464120	Saturday at nothing?
2464120	2466120	And then you're just like, aww.
2466120	2468120	I'll just run around.
2468120	2470120	Until it's raw and bleeding.
2470120	2476120	The coolest thing, I knew I was your, I don't know.
2476120	2477120	Doubleganger?
2477120	2478120	We do look alike.
2478120	2481120	Like a fraternal twin when I saw,
2481120	2487120	when you talked about your thing about when you saw Rocky,
2487120	2489120	or your whole thing about boxing.
2489120	2490120	Oh, yes.
2490120	2493120	It's like it doesn't matter how many times you get hit.
2493120	2495120	It's the fact that...
2495120	2496120	No, it's not how hard you hit.
2496120	2499120	It's so hard you can get hit and keep moving forward,
2499120	2501120	which is a quote from Rocky Balboa.
2501120	2504120	It has nothing to do with how much of a badass you are.
2504120	2505120	Like, I'm the biggest, I'm the baddest,
2505120	2508120	my dick is so huge, although my dick is enormous.
2508120	2511120	It's just like how tenacious you are,
2511120	2513120	because the fact of the matter is you're going to fail no matter what.
2513120	2515120	There is no avoiding failure, right?
2515120	2517120	It is literally laying in the road waiting for you to pull up in front of it,
2517120	2519120	like an episode of The Walking Dead,
2519120	2521120	where you pull up and there's a car in the middle of the road,
2521120	2523120	motherfucker, you're about to get shot.
2523120	2527120	It's more about like, how many times can I recover?
2527120	2528120	You know what I mean?
2528120	2531120	And everybody who's successful isn't successful because they're magic.
2531120	2534120	They're successful because they're like a junkyard dog.
2534120	2539120	Well, it's almost as if you will never be a good person
2539120	2542120	until you've empirically proven it by subjecting yourself
2542120	2544120	to acid test after acid test.
2544120	2545120	That is true, too.
2545120	2548120	Yeah, there is something, there is some self-satisfaction
2548120	2552120	in the like, I'm the toughest person out here, you cannot break me.
2552120	2556120	And even if you say, okay, you have the job, then I'll get fired.
2556120	2557120	Right, right, right.
2557120	2558120	Like, this is all going to end at any minute,
2558120	2561120	so I've got to have so many jobs that even if I got fired from nine of them,
2561120	2566120	there's a tenth one at like, you know, serving that frozen shit at press juicery,
2566120	2572120	like, I'm going to have one job left, which brings me to why I'm here.
2572120	2575120	No, I just, I like, literally, I have a week off this year,
2575120	2577120	I have one week off for all of 2016,
2577120	2583120	and I decided I was going to direct a movie in that hole, in that 10-day hole.
2583120	2584120	I'm serious, I was.
2584120	2588120	I was like, fuck it, like, why wait until next year, the year after,
2588120	2589120	to make my life a living hell?
2590120	2592120	So, I have a Kickstarter campaign, because as you know,
2592120	2594120	people love giving money to black people,
2594120	2596120	and they love even more giving money to women.
2596120	2599120	So, everyone's like, you're a Hollywood lady, you know,
2599120	2601120	just go get your Hollywood friends to give you money.
2601120	2604120	I don't know, when's the last time you saw a black female film director?
2604120	2607120	Meep, meep, meep, mop.
2607120	2610120	Wait, that was radar sweeping.
2610120	2613120	Or a really shitty cricket impression.
2613120	2615120	That's what black people think cricket sounds like.
2615120	2617120	That's what, yeah, exactly.
2617120	2619120	That's how black people say crickets.
2619120	2621120	That's how dejected they are.
2621120	2625120	These people don't have crickets.
2625120	2630120	Will you please go to Aisha's indie go-go page?
2630120	2634120	Give black people a chance to hear crickets.
2634120	2636120	Hey man, I'm so quiet.
2636120	2640120	For $45 a month, you can send Aisha to a farm.
2640120	2641120	Where crickets live.
2641120	2643120	Where she can understand how crickets actually sound.
2643120	2644120	I grew up in the city.
2644120	2650120	I want our other guests to know that we haven't forgotten about them.
2650120	2651120	No, no, we haven't forgotten them.
2651120	2653120	But anyway, that was all I wanted to say.
2653120	2656120	Let's get specific and then bring them out.
2656120	2658120	Did you kickstart Harmontown?
2658120	2660120	Did you kickstart the movie Harmontown?
2660120	2661120	No.
2661120	2663120	I would never be caught dead kickstarting.
2663120	2665120	No.
2665120	2667120	No, no, no, no.
2667120	2672120	Hello, white privilege.
2672120	2674120	No, what I did do is...
2674120	2675120	You know what white privilege smells like?
2675120	2677120	Snickerdoodles.
2677120	2681120	We kickstarted Anomalisa.
2681120	2683120	Warm cookies.
2683120	2684120	Warm cookies.
2684120	2686120	That's brute by Faberge.
2686120	2688120	You kickstarted Anomalisa.
2688120	2689120	We kickstarted Anomalisa.
2689120	2693120	We raised $400,000 overnight because that's what we asked for.
2693120	2695120	We raised that and then some.
2695120	2698120	And then proceeded to find out the movie cost $8,000,000, $9,000,000 to make.
2698120	2700120	And we couldn't tell any of them.
2700120	2706120	Long story short, I felt like we fucked up kickstarting so I haven't gone back since.
2706120	2710120	I think that that's a really sacred thing.
2710120	2712120	Yeah, it's a bond you're making.
2712120	2717120	You're a bond of honor and you're making a promise to people that you're going to do.
2717120	2718120	But I also think that people understand.
2718120	2719120	It's not free money.
2719120	2720120	No, it's not.
2720120	2721120	It's in a weird way.
2721120	2723120	You're taking more energy than you would spend pitching.
2723120	2724120	Oh, way more.
2724120	2725120	Way more.
2725120	2727120	And you're putting into updates and stuff because you owe...
2727120	2729120	You owe people a relationship to the project.
2729120	2732120	You owe people a connection to what you're doing that's ongoing.
2732120	2734120	And people always think, well, I'm just giving you money.
2734120	2735120	Well, no.
2735120	2736120	Like if you donate...
2736120	2738120	Let's say you donate 30 bucks and you get a t-shirt.
2738120	2742120	The t-shirt probably costs like 15 or 16 bucks to make and like 7 or 8 bucks to send to you.
2742120	2745120	So really, this is just about us hanging out.
2745120	2746120	You know what I mean?
2746120	2748120	It's just about us getting enough money to make this little thing.
2748120	2752120	I donated $2,000 and I was supposed to hang out with Dan.
2752120	2754120	Oh, God.
2754120	2756120	Can we just bring out an extra?
2756120	2758120	I still haven't gotten it.
2758120	2761120	I haven't gotten a t-shirt or a copy.
2761120	2766120	I gave him $2,000 of my hard-earned money.
2766120	2768120	My money that I...
2768120	2770120	Let me finish!
2770120	2771120	My money.
2771120	2774120	My money that's so hard to come by lately.
2774120	2775120	Ayesha.
2775120	2776120	It's so...
2776120	2777120	Where's Spencer?
2777120	2781120	Dan just will not have dinner with me.
2781120	2782120	What's the name of the film?
2782120	2784120	What's the name of the Kickstarter so people can locate this?
2784120	2785120	Oh, absolutely.
2785120	2791120	The movie's called Axis and you can just go to Kickstarter and type in Black Lady.
2791120	2793120	I'm the only one on Kickstarter, by the way.
2793120	2795120	I don't know what Black Kickstarter is.
2795120	2797120	Axis, Ayesha Tyler, you can find it.
2797120	2801120	Or just my socials, you know, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Ayesha Tyler.
2801120	2805120	And you're so much of a workaholic, you think you can direct a movie in one week?
2805120	2806120	Yeah, I do.
2806120	2807120	I do.
2807120	2808120	You're out of your mind.
2808120	2809120	How long is the film?
2809120	2812120	It's going to be 90 minutes, but here's what's cool about it.
2812120	2813120	So here's what's the cool thing about it.
2813120	2814120	Thank you, guy who loves film.
2814120	2818120	I love film too, but I don't want someone to make it in a week.
2818120	2820120	No, here's what's cool about this concept.
2820120	2821120	Oh, come on.
2821120	2825120	Let me tell you some things about Good Will Hunting.
2825120	2829120	You think they spent months on that piece of shit?
2829120	2830120	How do you like them apples?
2830120	2834120	I have a feeling I stepped into an ongoing conversation.
2834120	2838120	I don't know if you guys saw the movie Locke, but they shot that movie in five days.
2838120	2841120	So the way that we're doing this movie so that we kind of...
2841120	2842120	You know, a lot of my friends are doing it for free.
2842120	2844120	Most people are doing it for free or very cheap.
2844120	2847120	We're rehearsing it for the next two months
2847120	2850120	and then shooting the entire movie every day like a play
2850120	2852120	all the way through from beginning to end.
2852120	2853120	Wow.
2853120	2855120	That way we can adjust and pivot every night what worked,
2855120	2857120	what didn't go back and fix that the next day.
2857120	2860120	And by the end, we'll have shot the movie nine times in a row
2860120	2862120	and then we'll choose the best takes for each day.
2862120	2864120	Well, all bets are off now because did you see Louie's thing?
2864120	2865120	Thank you.
2865120	2866120	Thank you.
2866120	2869120	I'm a problem solver.
2869120	2871120	I should have known there would be applause there.
2872120	2874120	Did you see Louie CK's thing?
2874120	2875120	It was at Horace and Pete.
2875120	2876120	Let's go.
2876120	2879120	I mean, a very experimental on the surface of it where you're like,
2879120	2881120	I should full disclosure, I have not seen it.
2881120	2883120	I'm quoting my girlfriend.
2883120	2885120	He's describing it, but he hasn't actually watched it, which is cool.
2885120	2888120	She watched it and she's like, it's like he shot in a black box theater or something.
2888120	2890120	She got hopelessly addicted to it.
2890120	2892120	It turned from comedy to drama.
2892120	2898120	I mean, Louie CK is out there like doing whatever the fuck enters his head
2898120	2900120	and taking full advantage of the news.
2900120	2902120	There's nothing where he kind of did it on his own.
2902120	2904120	So he could do whatever he wanted because he didn't have a studio going,
2904120	2909120	I just don't, I don't understand why he has feelings.
2909120	2911120	Could he be good at his job?
2911120	2912120	He's not likable.
2912120	2913120	People like dogs.
2913120	2914120	Yeah, exactly.
2914120	2916120	I don't want him to be human.
2916120	2919120	I want him to look like something that I might want to eat off a plate with syrup.
2919120	2920120	So if we could just.
2920120	2925120	Could we have two black guys come in and just like fuck him with his big black dicks?
2925120	2926120	But then not stay.
2926120	2927120	No conversation.
2927120	2928120	Because they're fun.
2928120	2929120	Because they're fun.
2929120	2930120	They like their job.
2930120	2931120	Is Kevin Hart available?
2931120	2933120	All right.
2933120	2937120	So I would like you to stay, but you can leave anytime you want.
2937120	2939120	I'm going to sit here because you need a black friend.
2939120	2940120	Let's do this.
2940120	2941120	Let's bring out.
2941120	2946120	We have new friends who are friends of yours.
2946120	2949120	I'm very excited about this because two friends of ours.
2949120	2952120	And the music I've been playing tonight is by one of our guests.
2952120	2954120	I think it's Jordy.
2954120	2959120	Jordy White and Fred Ceblan, rock and roll musicians, who are new members of the Feral
2959120	2960120	Audio community.
2960120	2962120	And I love their podcast.
2962120	2963120	It's called Hour of Goon.
2963120	2965120	It's really, really, really fun.
2965120	2968120	And I'm very happy to be pals with these guys.
2968120	2970120	Let's bring out Jordy White and Fred Ceblan.
2984120	2985120	Is there something?
2985120	2986120	Your mic fell, Fred.
2986120	2987120	Is there something alive in there?
2987120	2988120	You want me to get the vacuum?
2988120	2989120	That's his turd.
2989120	2990120	Should I get the vacuum?
2990120	2991120	That's his poop.
2991120	2992120	Did he put in the box?
2992120	2993120	Poop, poop.
2993120	2994120	His poop.
2994120	2995120	Yeah.
2995120	2996120	No, we can get to that.
2996120	2997620	It's from me going this way.
2997620	3000120	It's Jordy first and Fred second, right?
3000120	3001120	Correct.
3001120	3002120	Yes.
3002120	3003120	Good head banging.
3003120	3004120	That guy was on.
3004120	3005120	That was intense.
3005120	3006120	I think you can take their word for it.
3006120	3007120	Yeah, that was good.
3007120	3008120	I did that.
3008120	3009560	Because you guys have...
3009560	3010560	Did you mention that?
3010560	3011560	I was in a blackout.
3012560	3016560	Well, I mean, you guys have been in bands for quite a long time.
3016560	3017560	Yes.
3017560	3018560	Marilyn Manson fame.
3018560	3020560	You guys are in Goon Moon, your new band together, right?
3020560	3021560	Yeah.
3021560	3022560	Which I love.
3022560	3023560	It's very groovy.
3023560	3025560	It's very whimsical and spooky.
3025560	3026560	Whimsical.
3026560	3027560	It is.
3027560	3028560	It's got whimsy.
3028560	3029560	It's weird.
3030560	3034560	So your podcast is you guys sitting in front of microphones.
3034560	3035560	Yeah.
3035560	3036560	There's no live audience.
3036560	3037560	Talking about nothing.
3037560	3038560	Yeah.
3038560	3039560	And you talk about nerdy stuff.
3040560	3043560	When you listen to Hour of Goon, and you must,
3043560	3047560	and a good one to start on is you?
3047560	3048560	No, not me.
3048560	3049560	Guess what?
3049560	3050560	I talk too much.
3050560	3051560	I talk too much.
3051560	3053560	Your friend, Jeff Hilliard, is he here tonight?
3053560	3054560	He's here tonight.
3054560	3055560	Stand up, Jeff.
3055560	3056560	Jeff, where are you?
3056560	3057560	Please have a jumpsuit.
3057560	3058560	Hilliard.
3058560	3059560	Just come show us.
3059560	3060560	Hilliard.
3060560	3061560	Should we come up?
3061560	3062560	Jeff Hilliard.
3062560	3063560	Let's get a look at your first talk.
3063560	3064560	Jeff Hilliard.
3064560	3066560	Go to Hour of Goon Hilliard.
3066560	3068560	This is Jeff Hilliard, the jumpsuit band.
3068560	3072560	He's committed to living in a van wearing jumpsuits at all times.
3072560	3075560	You're great in Beetlejuice, by the way.
3075560	3078560	You just made that house look amazing.
3078560	3081560	Also, if you want to freak out, go find the video.
3081560	3082560	Is it called The Good Life?
3082560	3083560	Yes.
3083560	3086560	You're not observing the fact that this is a custom jumpsuit.
3086560	3087560	It's custom.
3087560	3089560	He has these made.
3089560	3092560	The belt matches the lapels, matches the cuffs,
3092560	3094560	matches the drapes, matches the carpet.
3094560	3096560	It is quite, yeah, yeah.
3096560	3097560	Do a little spin.
3097560	3098560	Look at that.
3098560	3099560	Look at that.
3099560	3100560	Very nice.
3100560	3102560	I kind of want one.
3102560	3103560	Form fitting.
3103560	3105560	I kind of want one of these.
3105560	3106560	Try this one.
3106560	3107560	Well, you come to the right guy.
3107560	3108560	Here, you get them.
3108560	3109560	Do you have an Etsy account?
3109560	3110560	All right, Jeff.
3110560	3111560	Thank you for coming up.
3111560	3112560	Thanks, Jeff.
3112560	3113560	Thank you for coming.
3113560	3116560	When you go and fall in love with Hour of Goon, that episode,
3116560	3119560	get ready to fall in love with all three of these people.
3119560	3120560	It's really good.
3120560	3124560	So you go to Jordy's crib, and it is, I'm not exaggerating when I say,
3124560	3128560	it is Star Wars memorabilia from floor to ceiling.
3128560	3130560	Jordy is a fan of Star Wars.
3130560	3131560	Oh, yes.
3131560	3132560	Yeah.
3132560	3133560	That's ironic.
3133560	3136560	Oh, because Jordy from Star Trek, right?
3136560	3139560	I was the only one that made that connection in this room.
3139560	3140560	I didn't even know what you were talking about.
3140560	3141560	I heard that.
3141560	3142560	When that came out, I was like, oh, great.
3142560	3143560	Now that's...
3143560	3145560	You got to get one of them comb things across my eyes.
3145560	3147560	Before that, it was Jord-jeans.
3147560	3149560	And then it became, oh, Jordy from Star Trek.
3149560	3150560	Yeah.
3150560	3151560	That's nice.
3151560	3153560	But you sit there, and you just...
3153560	3154560	These guys...
3154560	3159560	What's your favorite Star Wars?
3159560	3160560	Phantom Menace.
3160560	3163560	I mean, come on.
3163560	3164560	Take it.
3164560	3165560	Take it.
3165560	3166560	You're way in on Star Wars.
3166560	3167560	Yeah.
3167560	3168560	Way in.
3168560	3169560	This guy knows his Star Wars.
3169560	3170560	Way in.
3170560	3171560	I'm kidding.
3171560	3172560	It's not my favorite, but I do like that.
3172560	3173560	I haven't seen that.
3173560	3174560	I don't even understand what that question means.
3174560	3175560	What's your favorite Star Wars?
3175560	3176560	Film universe.
3176560	3178560	But, like, what, movie?
3178560	3179560	Is it a person?
3179560	3180560	Or, like, fanfic?
3180560	3181560	There's a couple of wars.
3181560	3184560	What's your favorite one in the stars?
3184560	3185560	Dancing with the stars.
3185560	3186560	Empires.
3186560	3187560	Battle of the network stars.
3187560	3188560	Empires.
3188560	3189560	Everybody's favorite Star Wars.
3189560	3190560	Empire.
3190560	3192560	Empire followed by Force Awakens, obviously.
3192560	3193560	Correct, yes.
3193560	3194560	I haven't seen Force Awakens.
3194560	3195560	Yeah.
3195560	3196560	I like your style.
3196560	3197560	Yeah, I'm here for you.
3197560	3198560	Here we go.
3198560	3199560	Here we go.
3199560	3200560	Empire followed by Force Awakens.
3200560	3201560	I completely agree.
3201560	3202560	Right?
3202560	3203560	Seriously, right?
3203560	3204560	All the other ones are just, like, a bunch of shit that happen between.
3204560	3205560	I like Star Wars.
3205560	3206560	I like the first one.
3206560	3207560	I don't think Empire is better than Star Wars.
3207560	3210560	I didn't qualify to even proctor this conversation.
3210560	3211560	What?
3211560	3212560	What?
3212560	3213560	No.
3213560	3216560	I actually just bought two snowtroopers out there.
3216560	3217560	They said I couldn't put them in front of me.
3217560	3219560	I took a snowtrooper before I got on stage.
3219560	3221560	You got more gear out front?
3221560	3222560	Yeah.
3222560	3223560	I discussed them on the show.
3223560	3224560	It's great.
3224560	3225560	Getting stuff.
3225560	3226560	I love that.
3226560	3227560	You watch all of it.
3227560	3228560	Is that your thing, Dan?
3228560	3229560	Not anymore, no.
3229560	3231560	I haven't watched the new Force.
3231560	3232560	What's wrong with you?
3232560	3235560	I cried twice during the trailer and, like, eight times during the movie.
3235560	3236560	And I'm not even fucking around.
3236560	3237560	I cried.
3237560	3244560	I cried during the 20th Century Fox logo at Phantom Menace.
3244560	3250560	And my tears were punished and shoved back into my tear ducts.
3250560	3251560	And I was burnt.
3251560	3252560	And then you had notes.
3252560	3253560	And then you had notes on your tears.
3253560	3254560	Yeah.
3254560	3255560	And I was like, I can't.
3255560	3262560	Dan and I went to see Phantom Menace on a rainy Saturday afternoon at the Vista Theater.
3262560	3269560	And the word was coming down, the grapevine, that it was not a good movie.
3269560	3273560	And I called him up and I said, let's get it over with.
3273560	3274560	And it was like dead man walking.
3274560	3275560	We were walking.
3275560	3277560	We were standing in the rain.
3277560	3279560	And we watched it.
3279560	3284560	And, you know, I was like Dan, you know, tearing up during, like, 20th Century Fox
3284560	3286560	and a long, long time ago.
3286560	3287560	And then the crawl started.
3287560	3288560	The crawl.
3288560	3289560	I'm like, oh, my God.
3289560	3290560	It's a difficult time for the rebellion.
3290560	3291560	And I'm like, oh, my God.
3291560	3292560	Here we go.
3292560	3293560	Here we go.
3293560	3297560	The embargo of the two tweets is doing a thing with the sanctions with my Animar.
3297560	3298560	The crawl kept going.
3298560	3303560	It should have been our first clue.
3303560	3305560	Weird, weird crawl.
3305560	3306560	No problem.
3306560	3312560	On the upside, the makeup department on this movie is on fire, making dots on Amidala's
3312560	3313560	face.
3313560	3315560	Jeff fell asleep during Force Awakens.
3315560	3316560	Yeah.
3316560	3317560	I think I've mentioned here I did fall asleep.
3317560	3319560	And then I had a dream where I watched it in my dream.
3319560	3320560	And I fell asleep in my dream.
3320560	3321560	So you still haven't seen it.
3321560	3325560	At one point, at one point, we're watching Phantom Menace.
3325560	3328560	At one point, we're watching Phantom Menace.
3328560	3333560	And Dan puts his hands, he puts his face in his hands, going, oh, my God.
3333560	3335560	It's the worst movie ever made.
3335560	3339560	I can tell you the frame.
3339560	3340560	Yeah, I know.
3340560	3341560	I know.
3341560	3342560	And I'm like, God damn it.
3342560	3343560	Don't ruin this for me.
3343560	3344560	I'm holding on.
3344560	3348560	You know, because we had an agreement.
3349560	3350560	He was like, let's not prejudge.
3350560	3352560	I'm like, I'm not fucking here to prejudge.
3352560	3354560	You do realize they were made for children, right?
3354560	3355560	Yeah, I don't.
3355560	3356560	Yeah.
3356560	3360560	First of all, why you haven't gone to Force Awakens, which is like the most stupendous
3360560	3362560	filmic palate cleanser of that entire franchise.
3362560	3363560	Thank you.
3363560	3364560	It fixes everything.
3364560	3366560	Oh, so this one's for grownups?
3366560	3367560	Yes.
3367560	3368560	Yes, it fixes everything.
3368560	3370560	We'll all give it a look-see.
3370560	3372560	Everything that you want it to have happen in that universe is happening.
3372560	3373560	It's out on Blu-ray this week.
3373560	3374560	Everything is great.
3374560	3375560	Yeah.
3375560	3380560	And also, like, I feel like there's another part of you, like, we're all this person.
3380560	3384560	Like, I cut sixth grade to see Empire Strikes Back.
3384560	3387560	Like, I didn't go to school that day or the next day.
3387560	3389560	That's how much that franchise affected me.
3389560	3393560	So even the shitty ones, I feel like they're like the last three fries in the bottom of
3393560	3394560	the pack.
3394560	3396560	You just fucking eat them anyway.
3396560	3399560	You know, but they're burnt in black and they taste like feet.
3399560	3402560	But you do it because you eat all the fries.
3402560	3405560	Because you love fucking fries, Dan!
3405560	3408560	Yeah, you're a shitty fan, Dan.
3408560	3410560	I'm so in love right now.
3410560	3411560	I know.
3411560	3412560	I love you.
3412560	3413560	I'm so in love right now.
3413560	3414560	You're amazing.
3414560	3417560	Have you seen the new trailer for the new one that's coming out?
3417560	3418560	I have!
3418560	3420560	Like a thousand times.
3420560	3423560	And I mean, like...
3423560	3424560	I rebel.
3424560	3425560	The trailer's pretty cool.
3425560	3426560	The trailer's pretty cool, right?
3426560	3427560	It's pretty cool.
3427560	3428560	Yeah.
3428560	3429560	They already have all my cool shit.
3429560	3431560	And I watched it and I went, God damn it.
3431560	3433560	Well, what else am I gonna do with the rest of my life?
3433560	3434560	I gotta see this one, too.
3434560	3435560	What are you gonna do with the rest of your money?
3435560	3437560	Because I'm giving all my money to the world.
3437560	3438560	What are you gonna do with the rest of tonight?
3438560	3443560	You guys understand that me not bothering to click on Force Awakens has nothing to do
3443560	3445560	with me deciding that it's good or bad or anything.
3445560	3447560	Dan, we need you to be one of us.
3447560	3448560	No, it's...
3448560	3449560	One of us.
3449560	3450560	One of us.
3450560	3454560	It's the liberation of agnosticism after a lifetime of being battled around this fucking...
3454560	3459560	It's totally the liberation of agnosticism.
3460560	3461560	It's the liberation.
3461560	3463560	I'm on Dan's side.
3463560	3469560	I'm just saying, like, I will watch that movie the day it crawls into bed with me and goes,
3469560	3470560	it's time to watch it.
3470560	3471560	No.
3471560	3474560	Because that's what Star Wars did because I was three and I couldn't go anywhere.
3474560	3475560	That'll help delay with your boat.
3475560	3477560	What if Matt Damon crawls into bed with you with the Force Awakens?
3477560	3478560	Send him over to my house.
3478560	3479560	Ooh.
3479560	3480560	I just...
3480560	3481560	I just...
3481560	3483560	Like, look, come on, you can't tell me.
3483560	3485560	Come on, Force Awakens is not for grown-ups.
3485560	3487560	It's for grown-ups with kids.
3487560	3488560	You know what?
3488560	3489560	It's for grown-ups.
3489560	3490560	It's for grown-ups.
3490560	3491560	The way...
3491560	3493560	Okay, remember the first Star Trek movie, the reboot with Chris Pine?
3493560	3494560	Yes.
3494560	3495560	That one was for kids.
3495560	3497560	It was like a stupid fucking sequence where he goes through like a...
3497560	3498560	Zoinks!
3498560	3499560	It's a water pipe!
3499560	3500560	Boy!
3500560	3501560	Boy!
3501560	3502560	Boy!
3502560	3503560	Boy!
3503560	3504560	Boy!
3504560	3505560	Boy!
3505560	3506560	Boy!
3506560	3507560	Boy!
3507560	3508560	Boy!
3508560	3509560	Boy!
3509560	3510560	Boy!
3510560	3511560	Boy!
3511560	3512560	Boy!
3512560	3513560	Boy!
3513560	3514560	Boy!
3514560	3515560	Boy!
3515560	3516560	Boy!
3516560	3517560	No, I don't remember that.
3517560	3522560	And then, the second one, Star Trek Into the Darkness, or whatever that one was called.
3522560	3523560	Which I didn't want.
3523560	3524560	That was for grown-ups.
3524560	3525560	That was the one that was for grown-ups.
3525560	3528640	Ironically, I didn't watch that one because I was waiting for the world to react the way
3528640	3529640	they did the first one.
3529640	3533560	I really liked the first one because it was such a clever way of rebooting the franchise.
3533560	3535560	I liked the second one better, actually.
3535560	3537560	I think the bottom line is it's too late for me.
3537560	3538560	I like Into Darkness.
3538560	3539560	I can't watch movies normal.
3539560	3540560	You know?
3540560	3541560	I can't just enjoy them.
3541560	3542560	Don't die inside.
3542560	3543560	Come back.
3543560	3544560	Here's a movie.
3544560	3545560	Go watch Diary of a Teenage Girl.
3545560	3546560	That's really good.
3546560	3548560	I'm a grown-up now.
3548560	3549560	No, you're not.
3549560	3552560	I watch movies about teenage girls having sex with their parents.
3552560	3555560	Do you guys know what I did?
3555560	3556560	Spoiler alert!
3556560	3558560	Last night, we're all friends.
3558560	3567560	That movie is two black guys away from being a classic.
3567560	3571360	I did something last night that I think I might be the only person to have done.
3571360	3576160	I did Acid and watched Easter Parade with Judy Garland and Fred Astaire.
3576160	3577160	I want you to know.
3577160	3578160	That was for real?
3578160	3580160	And it was fucking swinging, man.
3580160	3585160	I want you to know, Jeff, that was super heterosexual.
3585160	3586160	Oh, no.
3586160	3587160	Then...
3587160	3589160	Oh, so now the movie's over.
3589160	3590160	Super straight.
3590160	3591160	It's 1 a.m.
3591160	3593160	I'm still on Acid and the lamp is like, hey.
3593160	3595160	My lamp is moving and walking around the room.
3595160	3596160	I'm like, you know what?
3596160	3597160	I've never done.
3597160	3599160	I'm tired, but I'm still high.
3599160	3600160	Yeah.
3600160	3601160	So I go to...
3601160	3603160	I get in bed and I get my iPad.
3603160	3604160	And I've never watched...
3604160	3605160	Because you guys...
3605160	3606160	I just met Roger Waters.
3606160	3608160	You guys are huge Floyd fans.
3608160	3609160	Yeah.
3609160	3611160	And we never really talked about...
3611160	3613160	I've heard you guys talk about it on your show.
3613160	3614160	That's a Pink Floyd guy.
3614160	3615160	Thank you.
3615160	3616160	Yes.
3616160	3617160	And you just saw Gilmore playing.
3617160	3618160	You guys have both seen it thousands of times.
3618160	3619160	Nothing but value from the right.
3619160	3620160	Yes, yes.
3620160	3621160	You guys are big Pink Floyd fans.
3621160	3624160	I have never done The Dark Side of the Rainbow where you watch the scene.
3624160	3625160	Oh, it's good.
3625160	3627160	I was watching that in my bed.
3627160	3629160	A little bit on Acid still.
3629160	3633160	Where you watch Wizard of Oz synced up to Dark Side of the Moon.
3633160	3637160	And I was like, oh, freaking out.
3637160	3640160	And also, I would freak out if I wasn't on Acid.
3640160	3641160	That's crazy.
3641160	3642160	Yeah.
3642160	3643160	It's fun.
3643160	3646160	But who was the first person that noticed that?
3646160	3649160	Eric Simmons.
3649160	3651160	Stand up, Eric.
3651160	3652160	Is he here tonight?
3652160	3653160	Is he here tonight?
3653160	3656160	Eric Simmons is here tonight.
3656160	3658160	Eric Simmons is here.
3658160	3665160	Eric Simmons, first person to watch the Wizard of Oz.
3665160	3666160	Here he is.
3666160	3667160	Eric?
3667160	3668160	Eric, come on.
3668160	3669160	Eric, Eric, come on.
3669160	3670160	It's VHS.
3670160	3671160	Can we get Eric up on stage?
3671160	3672160	Eric.
3672160	3673160	Eric Simmons.
3673160	3674160	Eric Simmons.
3674160	3675160	Eric Simmons.
3675160	3676160	Eric Simmons.
3676160	3677160	Eric Simmons.
3677160	3678160	You did it?
3678160	3679160	Eric Simmons.
3679160	3680160	Eric Simmons.
3680160	3681160	How you doing, Eric?
3681160	3682160	First person.
3682160	3683160	Eric, how you doing?
3683160	3684160	Look at all those snacks, Eric.
3684160	3685160	Tell us.
3686160	3688160	What you got?
3688160	3689160	Are you going to share?
3689160	3690160	I'll share.
3690160	3692160	Look at all those treats.
3692160	3695160	Some Fritos and a Coke.
3695160	3700160	Eric, look at all those Doritos, Eric.
3700160	3704160	Eric, you seem a little young to have been the first person to have ever watched.
3704160	3707160	Eric is 76.
3707160	3711160	How did you know to time it, to hit play when the lion roars?
3711160	3713160	Especially without DVDs.
3714160	3716160	My dad's a big fan.
3716160	3717160	Your dad's a big fan.
3717160	3719160	Who's your dad, Eric Simmons?
3719160	3720160	Mr. Simmons.
3720160	3721160	Richard Simmons.
3721160	3722160	Richard Simmons.
3722160	3723160	Richard Simmons.
3723160	3724160	Richard Simmons.
3724160	3725160	Richard Simmons.
3725160	3727160	Richard Simmons is here tonight, too.
3727160	3728160	Can we bring Richard Simmons up?
3728160	3729160	Where's Richard Simmons?
3729160	3731160	He's been missing, but he's revealed himself on Homotown.
3731160	3732160	Richard Simmons.
3732160	3733160	Richard Simmons.
3733160	3734160	Okay.
3734160	3737160	Eric, did you just leave our show and go buy a bunch of snacks?
3737160	3738160	What happened?
3738160	3739160	You don't have to go far.
3739160	3741160	Oh, you can buy Fritos back here.
3741160	3742160	Fritos back here.
3742160	3743160	Riveted by Star Wars guy.
3743160	3746160	Look, can I turn this into entertainment?
3746160	3747160	Please.
3747160	3749160	Please do this.
3749160	3751160	Eric, thank you for joining us.
3751160	3753160	Sorry, it was compulsory.
3753160	3756160	Sorry you got bullied for liking Doritos.
3756160	3757160	No, I like him.
3757160	3758160	I like Eric Simmons.
3758160	3759160	I love Doritos.
3759160	3760160	Bullied.
3760160	3761160	Eric, Eric, are you a-
3761160	3763160	His name's not Eric.
3763160	3765160	It's definitely not.
3765160	3766160	Eric, it's your name.
3766160	3767160	What's your name?
3767160	3768160	What's your name?
3768160	3769160	What's your name?
3770160	3773160	Eric, are you a fan of the Star Wars franchise in any capacity?
3773160	3775160	Yes, I appreciate it.
3775160	3777160	Okay, so we've got a group of people up here.
3777160	3782160	We all feel differently about different phases of the operation.
3782160	3788360	I think, you know, maybe it's a little trait of me, or maybe in my little heart, I just
3788360	3791160	want entertainment to happen on this podcast.
3791160	3792160	At some point.
3792160	3799000	Eric, would you just tell us, like, in your mind, where the perfect Star Wars movie would
3799000	3801000	be set in terms of timeline?
3801000	3803000	Tatooine?
3803000	3805000	Tatooine!
3805000	3809000	And then just to explain to you, then we're going to do it.
3809000	3811000	I'm going to do the movie.
3811000	3813000	So you want plot points, characters-
3813000	3814000	So don't fuck up.
3814000	3817000	And Ayesha's going to be a new form of Jedi, and it's not going to be-
3817000	3819000	That's what the Kickstarter's for, right?
3819000	3822000	So make Ayesha a Jedi.
3822000	3825000	Apparently I'm going to be in a porn with two black eyes.
3825000	3826000	You know what?
3826000	3827000	You're at the floor.
3827000	3830000	I'm going to just stop this.
3830000	3834000	It is right after the second prequel when General Grievous dies.
3834000	3836000	Ooh, god, dude, that was so inside.
3836000	3838000	We have to go Google everything now.
3838000	3840000	Which was Matrix Revolutions?
3840000	3842000	What was that?
3842000	3843000	The second prequel-
3843000	3844000	Reloaded!
3844000	3848000	Dark Knight Emerges?
3848000	3849000	Dark Knight Reloaded.
3849000	3851000	Electric Boogaloo.
3851000	3855000	You're saying the sequel to Phantom Menace, right?
3855000	3860000	If you want a serious answer, I really like what JJ's done with it now.
3860000	3863000	Okay, you've seen Force Awakens and you like it.
3863000	3864000	Yes.
3864000	3866000	But look, I'm going to ask a bigger question here, right?
3866000	3870000	I feel like it's cool now to hate everything, and that's not new.
3870000	3873000	It's been cool for like 10 or 15 years to hate everything.
3873000	3876000	And so like, just basic ingenuousness, right?
3876000	3879000	Like, I love this franchise, yeah, that wasn't my favorite, but I love-
3879000	3880000	That's not fair.
3880000	3881000	That's not fair.
3881000	3882000	What you're doing is not fair.
3882000	3884000	And if you notice, Eric's opening his snacks right now.
3884000	3885000	That's not fair.
3885000	3886000	That Dan wants chips.
3886000	3887000	I don't know if it's unfair that you hate chips.
3887000	3888000	Yes!
3888000	3889000	It's unfair that I'm saying that you're dead inside.
3889000	3890000	What chips?
3890000	3893000	Did you like Batman vs. Superman?
3893000	3895000	I haven't seen Batman vs. Superman.
3895000	3900000	I loved Batman vs. Superman, and I feel like everybody hated Batman vs. Superman because
3900000	3902000	they just wanted to hate Batman vs. Superman.
3902000	3904000	You just pulled the, I just like-
3904000	3905000	Eric Simmons, everybody.
3905000	3906000	Oh, he's not leaving.
3906000	3907000	He's just giving chips.
3907000	3908000	All right.
3908000	3912000	No, Eric, who's your favorite- who's your favorite star-
3912000	3918000	He has not blinked.
3918000	3923000	This is a mess.
3923000	3926000	I love it.
3926000	3929000	Eric Simmons.
3929000	3932000	Eric Simmons, I'm calling you out.
3932000	3935000	Oh, is he using- he's using the force.
3935000	3937000	I'm calling you out, Eric Simmons.
3937000	3939000	Eric, no one can hear that but you.
3939000	3940000	Eric!
3940000	3942000	I'm kind of worried about your physical safety, Eric.
3942000	3943000	Eric Simmons.
3943000	3945000	Eric, no one can hear that but you.
3945000	3956000	Eric Simmons, your cool ranch Jedi powers will not save you now.
3956000	3966000	Eric Simmons, what are you doing later?
3966000	3970000	Probably getting drunk and watching Daredevil.
3970000	3972000	Aw, it's adorable.
3972000	3973000	That's a good show.
3973000	3974000	That's the number one answer.
3974000	3976000	That is the number one answer.
3976000	3982000	I watched all of Jessica Jones on like a weekend.
3982000	3984000	It was so great.
3984000	3985000	So great.
3985000	3990000	It is a confusing time for the narrative.
3990000	3999000	Eric Simmons has been summoned to the stage only to find out that he himself is within
3999000	4005000	and weaving the narrative of the new Star Wars movie.
4005000	4014000	Meanwhile, Princess Aisha has been honing her craft as a Jedi on the swampy ice planet
4014000	4028000	of water sun with fleeb flop, the Jedi master, one of 700 needless wipes.
4028000	4034000	Does anybody not find it difficult that like the one thing, the one issue with the entire
4034000	4043000	Star Wars construct, the whole like, the whole UI is that sometimes shit is alien and sometimes
4043000	4049000	it's not like somebody's name is sometimes somebody's name is Lorraine.
4049000	4057000	It would seem even Aisha herself is unaware that the new movie is happening around her.
4057000	4063000	People just run out of ideas like your name is Bloop, your name is Gleeb Blop, that's
4063000	4064000	and then you're Dan.
4064000	4065000	Do you know what I'm saying?
4065000	4069000	Like that's not discouraged by her abilities as a padawan.
4069000	4074000	Flip flop calls the Jedi council via crystal hologram.
4074000	4077000	I'm sure there's a Lorraine in there.
4077000	4079000	Oh, wait, I don't know.
4079000	4081000	One of the guys in that movie.
4081000	4082000	It's got to be bleep up.
4082000	4083000	I'm going to look that up.
4083000	4084000	I'm into it.
4084000	4086000	If not, I'm going to design it.
4086000	4087000	All right.
4087000	4088000	All right.
4088000	4089000	All right.
4089000	4090000	All right.
4090000	4091000	Dead.
4091000	4092000	Dead.
4092000	4093000	Dead.
4093000	4094000	Dead.
4094000	4095000	Dead.
4095000	4096000	Dead.
4096000	4123920	You guys are blocking my entire childhood in a good portion of my adulthood and also
4123920	4125920	my past weekend.
4125920	4130920	What news from the fuckface show?
4130920	4134920	According to data analysis, there is a-
4134920	4140920	Your data analysis grows weary on me.
4140920	4145920	My lord, I'm only doing my best analysis of the data.
4145920	4152920	Your best is worst in the eyes of the Jedi.
4152920	4154920	My lord, please-
4154920	4158920	Your lord is- well, it's me. Go ahead, keep going.
4158920	4163920	Sorry, I got to do a cycle of refuting everything.
4163920	4164920	That's okay, you're-
4164920	4166920	It's all right. It's Monday.
4166920	4170920	I'm just saying that the data is saying that Eric Simmons is on planet Atu-
4173920	4179920	As he should be, all will be revealed according to plan.
4179920	4182920	Shall I activate the set piece?
4184920	4188920	Send the new toy to the new environment.
4188920	4192920	I will do the fourteenth of seven hundred wipes.
4209920	4225920	You've been conditioned to think this was impossible, so it's amazing.
4225920	4230920	Meanwhile, it has nothing to do with the story.
4230920	4234920	It wouldn't matter if this didn't happen.
4234920	4235920	Meanwhile-
4235920	4238920	I'm tangled in your tauntaun.
4238920	4243920	Meanwhile, in Air City-
4243920	4251920	The one black guy in the entire galaxy is just kicking it with a forty-ounceer of Colt 45.
4251920	4255920	I believe you're speaking about me.
4255920	4257920	Handsome lazy love.
4257920	4261920	Here's your Colt 45 ability.
4261920	4265920	I don't know what that is. I live a long time ago.
4265920	4269920	In a galaxy far, far away.
4269920	4271920	Come see my city.
4271920	4274920	You're crushing all of our childhood dreams right now.
4274920	4276920	Crushing them repeatedly.
4276920	4279920	Smearing them into dog poop.
4279920	4282920	Excuse me, Lando.
4285920	4287920	Lobot.
4287920	4290920	Yes, hello everyone.
4290920	4293920	Lando, I'm getting strange readings-
4293920	4295920	I'm sorry, hold on one second.
4295920	4296920	Okay, sure.
4296920	4298920	The legal department needs us.
4298920	4300920	Yes, XG312.
4300920	4301920	No, he's Lobot.
4301920	4304920	Look for it at Toys R Us.
4304920	4305920	He's Lobot.
4305920	4306920	Not XG312.
4306920	4307920	He's Lobot.
4307920	4308920	He's Lobot, yeah.
4308920	4309920	You guys-
4309920	4311920	He's missing some lights, but he's Lobot.
4311920	4312920	I'm a Lobot.
4312920	4313920	Alright, he's Lobot.
4313920	4314920	He's Lobot.
4314920	4315920	I'm a Lobot.
4315920	4316920	Alright, he's Lobot.
4316920	4317920	He doesn't know he's Lobot, but he's Lobot.
4317920	4318920	I'm Lobot Dad.
4318920	4319920	He's not as thirsty.
4319920	4320920	He'll get you some drinks.
4320920	4321920	Wow.
4321920	4322920	Yeah, pretty cool.
4322920	4325920	Wow, that should be explored for 20 minutes.
4325920	4326920	Yes.
4328920	4335920	Didn't you have an idea for a Y-slash-Z wing non-fighter?
4335920	4336920	Yes.
4336920	4343920	We should augment that into something new.
4344920	4350920	It might result in an X or Y-wing actual fighter.
4353920	4354920	That's how it happens.
4354920	4356920	Here's your movie in five days.
4356920	4358920	I don't think Lando made those ships.
4358920	4360920	Thanks for finishing my movie tonight, guys.
4360920	4361920	Put it on wax.
4361920	4364920	Alright, I've touched a nerve.
4364920	4370920	Now, are there any Latino characters in the new one?
4370920	4371920	So many.
4371920	4372920	There better be.
4372920	4373920	There are?
4373920	4374920	Poe Dameron.
4374920	4375920	Who?
4375920	4377920	Is it Poe Dameron, like South American or something?
4377920	4380920	No, Poe is like Middle Eastern-y, right?
4380920	4383920	No, I think he's from like South America, right?
4383920	4384920	He's from Miami.
4384920	4385920	But the actual actor is Latino?
4385920	4386920	Is he?
4386920	4387920	Oh.
4387920	4388920	Guatemalan.
4388920	4389920	Isn't he possibly?
4389920	4390920	You're authoritative.
4390920	4391920	This is very seductive.
4391920	4392920	Isn't he?
4392920	4393920	He's possibly gay, too.
4393920	4394920	He's Cuban.
4394920	4395920	He's possibly gay.
4395920	4397920	I have a pillow with Poe Dameron's face on.
4397920	4398920	Oh.
4398920	4399920	I do.
4399920	4400920	I wake up to him every morning.
4400920	4401920	A pillow.
4401920	4402920	Thank you, Aisha.
4402920	4406920	I dropped a Poe Dameron before I came on stage.
4406920	4411920	Now, my friends, when I was in high school, had a theory that Chewbacca was the only Latino
4411920	4416920	because his name is Chewie, which is a nickname for Jesus.
4416920	4417920	It's true.
4417920	4420920	And he's brown, and he's a mechanic.
4420920	4421920	Eric Simmons?
4421920	4426920	Eric Simmons, do you care to comment?
4426920	4427920	No.
4427920	4430920	Because that is not my name.
4430920	4436920	What I like about Eric is that I feel like Eric is like, I really could be at home watching
4436920	4437920	Daredevil now.
4437920	4438920	No, no.
4438920	4443480	And I regret all of my life choices that resulted in this moment.
4443480	4447920	I might regret getting up and using the bathroom at the very moment that I get smashed.
4447920	4448920	Yeah, but you got to be in the back.
4448920	4449920	No.
4449920	4450920	I made more stuff.
4450920	4451920	You had to give away half your Doritos, bro?
4451920	4455400	You want the Cool Ranch Taco Bell Dorito?
4455400	4458920	I have not had said Doritos Locos Taco.
4458920	4459920	That's pretty good.
4459920	4462920	No, I don't feel like it's enough.
4462920	4463920	Hang on.
4463920	4464920	Real quick, real quick.
4464920	4468920	It is a difficult challenge at the time for everyone that's talking.
4468920	4475320	The taco shell has the flavor of Cool Ranch, but it doesn't have the substance and texture
4475320	4477280	of an actual Dorito.
4477280	4482720	So you bite into it, and you're like, this is a thin substitute for an actual Cool Ranch
4482720	4483720	Dorito.
4483720	4488160	And I could have just bought all the fillings for a taco and stuck some real fucking Doritos
4488160	4489160	into that shit.
4489160	4490160	And it would have been way better.
4490160	4491160	And it would have been way better.
4491160	4492160	Like Dorito not just fired.
4492160	4493160	Yes.
4493160	4494160	All right.
4494160	4495160	I'm going to clean up the stage.
4495160	4496160	I'm going to send Eric Simmons back to the scene.
4496160	4497160	Please.
4497160	4498160	Thank you.
4498160	4499160	Thank you.
4499160	4500160	Eric Simmons, everybody.
4500160	4501160	Thanks, Eric.
4501160	4502160	He thought like a lion.
4502160	4503160	Run!
4503160	4510840	Also, Jordy and Fred, welcome to the special give and take episode of our podcast right
4510840	4512840	now.
4512840	4513840	Eric Simmons is a fox.
4513840	4514840	Oh, yeah.
4514840	4515840	Yeah.
4515840	4516840	Looking good.
4517840	4518840	That's like a man with half a bag of Doritos in his hand.
4518840	4519840	Yes, sir.
4519840	4522840	I just noticed that you've been holding a mysterious box yourself the entire time.
4522840	4523840	Okay.
4523840	4524840	Yeah.
4524840	4525840	Are those your snowtroopers?
4525840	4526840	No, these are not my snowtroopers.
4526840	4527840	Okay.
4527840	4528840	So now, and it's not your turd.
4528840	4529840	Okay.
4529840	4530840	So I know you pooped in a box.
4530840	4531840	No, okay.
4531840	4535520	So I'm a big fan of this movie called Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club.
4535520	4536520	Never heard of it.
4536520	4537520	Never heard of it.
4537520	4540640	It's with the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, and they sing Beatles songs.
4540640	4541640	Yes, Chicago.
4541640	4542640	It's fantastic.
4542640	4545000	I don't think it's fantastic in the way they intended, but it's a wonderful film if you
4545000	4546000	haven't seen it.
4546000	4547000	Check it out.
4547000	4551840	Anyways, I was searching on eBay for some memorabilia from this movie, and I found some
4551840	4555640	shoes that allegedly were George Burns' shoes.
4555640	4556640	No.
4556640	4557640	Okay.
4557640	4560000	Now, they were like $3,000 or something like that.
4560000	4564160	So I'm like, I'm sure as hell can't ... I'm not gonna buy George Burns' shoes for $3,000
4564160	4569120	unless I'm incredibly high and drunk at late at night, which hasn't happened in a while.
4569120	4573440	So one day, I tweeted about them, then one day I found a box backstage that was sitting
4573440	4575920	there for weeks, and I just was too afraid to open it.
4575920	4576920	Next stage, when you guys are on the road?
4576920	4577920	On the road, yes.
4577920	4580200	Yeah, on the road I found this box right in there.
4580200	4581200	You found it.
4581200	4583160	Well, someone brought it, hey, someone brought you a gift.
4583160	4586200	I'm like, okay, put it over with a pile of gifts, because I'm just so loved by everybody.
4586200	4587360	You get so many gifts.
4587360	4588960	I just get so many gifts, yes.
4588960	4589960	Just so many.
4589960	4590960	Oh my God.
4590960	4591960	Put it with the other big goods of much known origin.
4591960	4595600	But maybe there's anthrax in here and whatever, or is there a turd?
4595600	4596600	Anthrax parties.
4596600	4597600	Maybe it's an aborted baby from some ...
4597600	4598600	Those are the best.
4598600	4599600	Who knows?
4599600	4604560	Anyways, so I opened it up, and lo and behold, I found the white Italian loafers.
4604560	4605720	No.
4606000	4607520	Are those the ones that you wanted?
4607520	4608520	These were the ones that I wanted.
4608520	4613040	And I got so excited that I queued up Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on tour bus,
4613040	4614040	on tour.
4614040	4615040	We watched the whole thing.
4615040	4616040	And watched it a thousand times.
4616040	4617040	I was trying to pause it.
4617040	4622400	I'm like, and I finally found a shot with him dancing with white shoes on, but they
4622400	4623400	weren't these shoes.
4623400	4624400	No.
4624400	4625960	So I was like, oh my God.
4625960	4628240	So they said Butterfield and Butterfield on them and everything.
4628240	4632320	So I called, and I found out there were actually George Burns's shoes from Oh God You Devil
4632320	4633320	2.
4633320	4634320	Two?
4634320	4635320	Yes.
4635320	4636320	Three.
4636320	4637320	The third one.
4637320	4638320	So when he plays the devil.
4638320	4639320	Oh God.
4639320	4640320	Oh God You Devil.
4640320	4641320	Yeah.
4641320	4642320	The one where he's dancing.
4642320	4643720	He's dancing in these shoes at a wedding reception as a devil.
4643720	4649320	Because those look a little later in terms of design than Sergeant Pepper's for me.
4649320	4650320	Yes.
4650320	4651320	Yes.
4651320	4652320	They're Italian loafers.
4652320	4653320	And these are not a gift.
4653320	4655640	These were a gift for me, so no one can have these.
4655640	4657960	But I'm willing to let anyone try them on who's a size.
4657960	4658960	What a business.
4658960	4659960	We call this a size.
4659960	4660960	What size?
4660960	4661960	If there's a size of seven and a half.
4661960	4662960	Seven and a half.
4662960	4663960	Seven and a half.
4663960	4664960	Seven and a half.
4665600	4666600	Eric Simmons.
4666600	4667600	Eric Simmons.
4667600	4668600	Eric Simmons.
4668600	4669600	Are you a seven and a half?
4669600	4670600	Eric Simmons.
4670600	4671600	No.
4671600	4672600	I mean you could.
4672600	4673600	That's not, when a guy's feet get that small.
4673600	4674600	He's a comic legend.
4674600	4675600	He starts to become hot.
4675600	4677600	Yeah, but I heard he has a really big job though.
4677600	4678600	It's definitely not Jeff's though.
4678600	4679760	Because I've heard things about Jeff.
4679760	4683840	Jeff, Brian Davis, you can't even put your hands in those shoes you giant.
4683840	4685840	You're so tiny.
4685840	4687400	He's a little George Burns shoes.
4687400	4688400	But he was well endowed.
4688400	4691480	Tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk.
4691480	4694560	It is a frustrating time for the legion of shoes.
4695160	4699880	So, that's why he had the cigar because he had small feet.
4699880	4704960	But if anyone's willing to try these on, seven and a half.
4704960	4705960	Come on up.
4705960	4706960	We have a young...
4706960	4708160	Wait, can I do that on your show?
4708160	4709160	Can I invite someone up?
4709160	4710160	Oh yeah.
4710160	4711160	I invited Eric up.
4711160	4713960	I think you might have noticed, it's a fucking free for all.
4713960	4716000	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
4716000	4719560	And obviously this isn't Cinderella, I'm not going to take you home and get weird.
4719560	4721160	What is your name, madam?
4721160	4722960	Although seeing you, maybe he might revise.
4722960	4723960	Stephanie everybody.
4723960	4726160	It's really exciting actually.
4726160	4727160	Hi Stephanie.
4727160	4730760	Someday my prince will come.
4730760	4732760	Oh.
4732760	4734160	Have you never seen them on a feet until now?
4734160	4735160	I've never seen them on a feet.
4735160	4736160	No, it's one of them except for George.
4736160	4737160	Yeah.
4737160	4740160	This is no good for video or audio.
4740160	4741160	Wow.
4741160	4742160	We need a...
4742160	4745160	Yeah, if you could just do a handstand so everybody can see.
4745160	4746160	Yes.
4746160	4747160	Podcast.
4747160	4749160	A little higher, sweetie.
4749160	4752160	Now Stephanie, do you know who George Burns is even?
4753160	4755160	Oh my God.
4755160	4756160	Even better.
4756160	4758160	She has no idea.
4758160	4763160	He's one of the greatest comedians in American comedy history.
4763160	4764160	Huh?
4764160	4767160	She's testing you.
4767160	4769160	She's testing you.
4769160	4773160	The best stuff is when it was him and his wife Gracie who died before him.
4773160	4775160	And he always said that she was the funny one.
4775160	4776160	Goodnight Gracie.
4776160	4777160	Say goodnight Gracie.
4777160	4778160	Exactly.
4778160	4779160	Say goodnight to the folks.
4779160	4780160	Goodnight to the folks.
4780160	4781160	Fantastic.
4781160	4783160	So you do know him.
4783160	4784160	You know that joke.
4784160	4785160	I know that joke.
4785160	4786160	All right.
4786160	4787160	Thank you Stephanie.
4787160	4791160	You may not know this about George Burns but he had a terrible fungal infection in both
4791160	4793160	of his feet and...
4793160	4794160	Just so you know.
4794160	4795160	Actually what ended his life.
4795160	4796160	That's why he didn't want to wear him.
4796160	4799160	And he was the last person to wear those shoes so...
4799160	4802160	He actually died of foot herpes.
4802160	4803160	That was a...
4803160	4806160	The only known case of foot herpes in...
4806160	4807160	The only fatal...
4807160	4810160	He's human history which is the name of this drink.
4810160	4811160	Just the left foot.
4811160	4812160	Made in Italy.
4812160	4813160	Made in Italy.
4813160	4814160	A drink of mine?
4814160	4815160	Okay.
4815160	4816160	Sure.
4816160	4817160	After you touch George Burns' fungal feet.
4817160	4818160	Yes, exactly.
4818160	4819160	Have a sip of epithelials.
4819160	4820160	Thank you Stephanie.
4820160	4821160	All right.
4821160	4822160	All right.
4822160	4823160	All right.
4823160	4824160	Yeah.
4824160	4825160	Now Jordy.
4825160	4826160	Yes Jeff.
4826160	4827160	What...
4827160	4829160	You brought those just to show and tell?
4829160	4830160	Was that just to show off?
4830160	4832160	Well I just wanted them to be immortalized on...
4832160	4834160	I've talked about these shoes for years but I wanted them to be...
4834160	4836160	I'm so immortalized on Marmotown.
4836160	4837160	A few years.
4837160	4838160	That's cool.
4838160	4839160	A few years, yeah.
4839160	4840160	Are you a collector?
4840160	4841160	I am.
4841160	4842160	I wanted to get like a...
4842160	4843160	What do you call the box?
4843160	4844160	The shadow box?
4844160	4845160	Or something that...
4845160	4846160	Yeah, shadow box.
4846160	4847160	Yeah.
4847160	4848160	But it would just take up too much room in my house.
4848160	4850160	Well you've got Kurt Cobain's jacket too.
4850160	4851160	No I have his jeans.
4851160	4852160	Oh his jeans?
4852160	4853160	No I have his jacket.
4853160	4854160	You have his jacket.
4854160	4855160	He has Kurt Cobain's jacket.
4855160	4857160	I was gonna say the worst possible thing I could say.
4857160	4858160	So we get Billy Zane's pants.
4858160	4859160	Not that jacket.
4859160	4860160	Oh yeah.
4860160	4861160	Also if you listen to their podcast.
4861160	4862160	Save me from myself.
4862160	4863160	Yeah.
4863160	4864160	Not that one.
4864160	4868120	If you listen to Hour of Goon you'll find out that these guys have an abiding obsession
4868120	4869120	and love.
4869120	4870120	A deep love I would say.
4870120	4871120	Of Billy Zane.
4871120	4872120	Oh geez.
4872120	4873120	You guys really love Billy Zane.
4873120	4874120	Who the fuck doesn't love Billy Zane?
4874120	4875120	Where is it?
4875120	4876120	No.
4876120	4877120	Are you in?
4877120	4878120	Billy Zane?
4878120	4879120	Where is he?
4879120	4880120	Where isn't he?
4880120	4881120	No but where is he though?
4881120	4882800	Jordy and Fred can you get us Billy Zane?
4882800	4883800	Because you're friends with Billy Zane.
4883800	4884800	Yeah.
4884800	4885800	Yeah we can get Billy Zane.
4885800	4886800	We can get Billy Zane.
4886800	4887800	As long as I'm here with him.
4887800	4888800	Get him on the show.
4888800	4889800	Yes.
4889800	4890800	Yeah.
4890800	4891800	You're not coming without Billy Zane.
4891800	4892800	Dan doesn't want him on the show?
4892800	4893800	What?
4893800	4894800	No.
4894800	4895800	What?
4895800	4896800	You don't want Billy Zane on the show?
4897800	4899800	Dan is not interested in Billy Zane whatsoever.
4899800	4900800	Yes he is.
4900800	4901800	Yes he is.
4901800	4904800	I'm the most interested person in Billy Zane that has ever done it.
4904800	4905800	Second most.
4905800	4906800	Don't.
4906800	4910800	There was an article in Salon about how much more interested I am in Billy Zane than Billy
4910800	4911800	Zane.
4911800	4913800	There's like a point counter point.
4913800	4914800	No way.
4914800	4915800	I'm sorry everybody.
4915800	4916800	It was in slate.
4916800	4917800	Wait.
4917800	4918800	What's my favorite ice cream?
4918800	4919800	It was in slate.
4919800	4920800	Rocky road butch.
4920800	4921800	And he's like did you say bitch or butch?
4921800	4922800	And I'm like.
4922800	4923800	Blah.
4923800	4924800	Blah.
4924800	4925800	And he's like that's what I would have said.
4925800	4927800	And I'm like yeah cause I'm zany.
4927800	4928800	I'm worried though.
4928800	4929800	It's in Zane.
4929800	4930800	And he was like I've been unseamed.
4930800	4931800	And I'm like yeah.
4931800	4932800	I think he's doing fine.
4932800	4933800	Is he okay?
4933800	4934800	I think he's doing fine.
4934800	4935800	If you get on a Snapchat.
4935800	4936800	Yeah Snapchat is.
4936800	4938800	You and your mom where I'm like worried about Billy Zane.
4938800	4940800	Like you see people and you're excited about them and then you just want to know what they're
4940800	4941800	doing now.
4941800	4942800	He's got TV shows.
4942800	4943800	No he's funny.
4943800	4944800	He was on community.
4944800	4945800	He's on that great show.
4945800	4946800	He's on the show on Netflix.
4946800	4947800	He's on the show where all the guys go down and they die in Mexico.
4947800	4948800	Blah.
4948800	4949800	Yeah.
4949800	4950800	Yeah.
4950800	4951800	Amazon.
4951800	4952800	Amazon.
4952800	4953800	Amazon.
4953800	4954800	Amazon.
4954800	4957800	There's a challenging time for the people of.
4957800	4958800	Amazon.
4958800	4959800	Prime.
4959800	4960800	People.
4960800	4961800	People on the planet of Amazon Prime.
4961800	4962800	Probably be joyless.
4962800	4963800	You guys didn't get the cue.
4963800	4966800	The guy wanted to do a Star Wars movie with you guys.
4966800	4968800	We were with you the whole time.
4968800	4969800	No you weren't.
4969800	4970800	We were sitting there watching you do the scroll.
4970800	4972800	I think the problem was because we're all sitting in a straight line.
4972800	4974800	There was no like we couldn't see each other.
4974800	4977800	I think it was too much going on at once and everybody was so excited.
4977800	4978800	Well I don't want to fight about it.
4978800	4979800	Jeff is validating you.
4979800	4982800	The guy who invented the Pink Floyd thing was up here.
4982800	4983800	So it was just there's a lot of people you know.
4983800	4984800	All right.
4984800	4985800	Well okay.
4985800	4986800	That's how you guys feel.
4986800	4987800	I support you.
4987800	4988800	Do you guys.
4988800	4989800	Do you guys.
4989800	4992800	Would you guys ask Dan and Aisha.
4992800	4993800	The brunch question.
4993800	4994800	Oh.
4994800	4995800	Okay.
4995800	4996800	Oh no.
4996800	4997800	Should I start.
4997800	4998800	Yeah go ahead.
4998800	4999800	Start and then I'll lead and then evolve.
4999800	5000800	It is a difficult time for the brunch question.
5000800	5001800	Okay.
5001800	5002800	Now we can we can.
5002800	5003800	Dan leave it.
5003800	5004800	Leave it.
5004800	5005800	So I'm at home.
5005800	5006800	Right.
5006800	5008800	And this guy likes to eat brunch all the time.
5008800	5010800	He never eats at home for some reason.
5010800	5011800	Fred over here.
5011800	5012800	It's delicious.
5012800	5013800	He's at home.
5013800	5014800	This is drink.
5014800	5015800	I know.
5015800	5016800	I'm listening to this.
5016800	5017800	I'm telling you fucking brunch on me and you.
5017800	5018800	There you go.
5018800	5019800	Really.
5019800	5020800	Oh dude.
5020800	5021800	You made me a delicious drink by the way.
5021800	5022800	I feel very strongly about brunch.
5022800	5023800	Thank you.
5023800	5024800	Good.
5024800	5025800	And I would like you involved in this.
5025800	5027800	So he invites me to brunch and I can't get over this.
5027800	5028800	This.
5028800	5029800	This predicament that's in my head constantly.
5029800	5031800	So he invites me to brunch and I sit down.
5031800	5032800	We wait.
5032800	5034800	We have small talk and then I'm panicking.
5034800	5038800	I start sweating because the waitress is coming over to ask what we want to drink.
5038800	5039800	Right.
5039800	5040800	And I want them to ask him first.
5040800	5042300	But for some reason they always ask me first.
5042300	5043300	It's a long hair.
5043300	5044300	It's the hair.
5044300	5045300	It's the hair.
5045300	5046300	That's what I say.
5046300	5047300	Authoritative hair.
5047300	5048300	Yeah.
5048300	5049300	You know what I'm talking about.
5049300	5050300	Yeah.
5050300	5051300	Yeah.
5051300	5052300	It's the hair.
5052300	5053300	And since it's brunch, which I think is a bullshit fucking word anyways, it's like,
5053300	5054300	I don't know why it's a breakfast or lunch.
5054300	5056300	They go, well, what do you want to drink?
5056300	5057300	I'm totally confused.
5057300	5062140	Do I get orange juice or do I get ice tea because it's going to dictate what I have
5062140	5065020	if we're having breakfast or if we're having lunch.
5065020	5068500	So you don't have an orange juice, but so he orders a nice tea, right?
5068500	5070080	He orders the ice tea.
5070080	5072140	So I'm thinking I'm in the clear for lunch.
5072140	5074640	So I order, I order a nice tea too.
5074640	5079060	And then I order the tuna melt and he throws his curve ball and orders a breakfast burrito.
5079060	5080060	So now I'm like, right?
5080060	5081060	That's fucking right.
5081060	5085820	I'm like, what the fuck?
5085820	5091220	And now, now we're having breakfast and he's having lunch and I can't fucking do this.
5091220	5092760	I feel terrible.
5092760	5093760	I can't do it.
5093760	5096980	What kind of relationship does that bother you?
5096980	5097980	It's all in my head though.
5097980	5098980	He doesn't give a shit.
5098980	5099980	I do.
5100980	5106180	He has an issue with the fact that I get a fucking Arnold Palmer while I'm getting a
5106180	5107180	breakfast burrito.
5107180	5108180	That's why I fucking hate brunch.
5108180	5109180	Make it breakfast.
5109180	5110180	Make it lunch.
5110180	5111180	11 o'clock sucks.
5111180	5113180	But then he'll have orange juice at like three in the afternoon.
5113180	5114180	What's that about?
5114180	5125840	If you guys are looking for a person to tell you you're sane, you've got the wrong guy.
5125840	5130840	But if you want me to tell you it's okay that you're out of your fucking mind, I'm
5130840	5131840	on your side.
5131840	5132840	But that doesn't...
5132840	5134840	What we're asking Dan is what they're eating?
5134840	5140600	What you're saying makes no sense to me and I'd like to think my audience.
5140600	5143560	Fred, did I not explain it all enough for you guys?
5143560	5145360	Why would your meals be syncopated?
5145360	5146360	You get it.
5146360	5147360	You're pissed too, right?
5147360	5148360	That doesn't make any sense.
5148360	5150720	You get weird when somebody orders breakfast at the same time he ate lunch.
5150720	5152280	That's the whole thing.
5152280	5153940	Take Dan to brunch and have a hypothetical brunch right now.
5153940	5155020	What's the worst case scenario?
5155020	5157340	Can we explore the worst case scenario?
5157340	5158340	Absolutely.
5158340	5160220	We're trying to break it down.
5160220	5162220	As a virtual reality scene.
5162220	5163940	Okay, so who's who?
5163940	5166460	I could be the waiter, I could be Jordy, I could be Fred.
5166460	5170020	You'll be the waiter, I'll be me, and I'll be Fred, yeah.
5170020	5172020	Or I could be the waiter and you'll be me.
5172020	5173020	I'll be the barista.
5173020	5174020	I'm going to do the corollary.
5174020	5178740	I'm just going to hold and do the corollary, so I'm just standing by for post script.
5178740	5181780	I won't do a ton of blocking, I'm just standing up to get in the zone.
5181780	5183980	Wait, is Ayesha at breakfast?
5184180	5186300	I'm doing the post credits Coda.
5186300	5188300	I'm just standing down.
5188300	5196860	Because obviously nobody fucking understands brunch at all on this stage.
5196860	5198420	I have brunch.
5198420	5204660	I listen to your show and it's the only podcast, I yell, I'm in my car and I'm yelling at my
5204660	5208860	car stereo going like, who gives a shit?
5208860	5209860	Or.
5209860	5210860	Or.
5210860	5211860	Too bad.
5211860	5213260	I'm totally on Jordy's side on certain things.
5213340	5214700	I'm totally on Fred's side.
5214700	5216820	Dude, brunch is MMA.
5216820	5219260	All fight styles are invited.
5219260	5220260	Yeah.
5220260	5223260	If you want to drink orange juice, it's okay.
5223260	5225260	If you want, I see it's okay.
5225260	5228260	If you want to get fucked up at nine in the morning.
5228260	5229260	That's true.
5232260	5234260	That is why brunch was invented.
5234260	5235260	You're sober.
5235260	5236260	You've had 17 coffees.
5236260	5241260	I'm about to fucking masturbate at the table because I'm wasted.
5241260	5242260	Wait, what?
5242260	5244260	Wait, what was the end?
5246260	5247260	Okay.
5247260	5248260	Okay.
5248260	5249260	I love you.
5249260	5255260	Aisha, voice of the people, plus a little 5% nugget there that's...
5255260	5256260	What was that?
5256260	5259260	Brunch is whatever you want it to be.
5259260	5260260	Yeah, I heard that part.
5260260	5261260	I heard that part.
5262260	5263260	That's what I heard.
5263260	5265260	Yeah, but what about sharing a meal with someone?
5265260	5267260	No, no, you and I are at the same table.
5267260	5270260	That's all the sharing that you get from me.
5270260	5272260	But there's eggs and tuna on the same thing.
5272260	5273260	Doesn't match.
5273260	5279260	I had pancakes and a bottle of vodka and a piece of pie.
5279260	5280260	Well, because you're a drunk.
5280260	5282260	You ordered breakfast at the wrong time.
5282260	5283260	I'm a fucking...
5283260	5284260	USA.
5284260	5285260	USA.
5285260	5286260	USA.
5286260	5287260	USA.
5287260	5288260	USA.
5288260	5289260	USA.
5289260	5290260	USA.
5290260	5291260	USA.
5291260	5292260	USA.
5292260	5293260	What?
5293260	5296260	Guys, I have no idea what that's going to do with brunch, but I'm going to do it.
5296260	5298260	It's the first time in my life I've been a patriot.
5298260	5300260	I'd like to apologize to Fred and Jordy.
5300260	5302260	It's not normally like this, you guys.
5302260	5304260	I mean, I'm happy right now.
5304260	5306260	Actually, I take that back.
5306260	5307260	It's always like this.
5307260	5308260	This is like having sex, right?
5308260	5314260	Like if you're like a straight missionary style position, and then in the middle someone slips a finger into your bum,
5314260	5316260	you just go, look, that wasn't what I was expecting.
5316260	5318260	But hey, you know, that's how you get down.
5318260	5322260	I'll drink my iced tea, and you have your tuna melt, and everything's going to be okay.
5322260	5325260	Okay, so if you have an iced tea, I can have a tuna melt.
5325260	5326260	Yeah, exactly.
5326260	5328260	I see matches with the tuna melt, but not your shoes.
5328260	5330260	But in the interest of...
5330260	5332260	Orange juice and tuna melt definitely do not do that.
5332260	5334260	Hey, Ayesha, Ayesha, do you want to get brunch after the show?
5334260	5336260	Ha ha.
5336260	5337260	These guys are saying...
5337260	5338260	You know I do.
5338260	5340260	Let's just do the...
5340260	5342260	Let's just do the virtual scene.
5342260	5344260	I'll be the waiter.
5344260	5345260	Brunch.
5345260	5346260	I just want to...
5346260	5349260	Because, you know, you don't know, like these guys may have a...
5349260	5350260	So, okay, I'm the waiter.
5350260	5352260	So are we sitting at the table?
5352260	5353260	Dan, you should be at the table.
5353260	5354260	Yeah, Dan, be at the table.
5355260	5356260	I'll be the waiter.
5356260	5357260	I'll be a...
5357260	5358260	Why don't you...
5358260	5359260	I'll be the waiter.
5359260	5360260	I'll be the waiter.
5360260	5361260	Be a neutral waiter.
5361260	5362260	Because this sketch is racist.
5362260	5367260	I question Ayesha Tyler's ability to be an impartial waiter.
5367260	5369260	I'll be the waiter.
5369260	5370260	I'm going to be the waiter.
5370260	5371260	I'm going to be the waiter.
5371260	5372260	Where are we having brunch, you guys?
5372260	5373260	Where are we having brunch?
5373260	5374260	101 Cafe.
5374260	5375260	101 Cafe?
5375260	5376260	That's the Waffle.
5376260	5377260	I guess this is for the optics.
5377260	5380260	Oh, well, if it's the Waffle, we'll be waiting in line for 17 hours.
5380260	5382260	So, let's try a 101 Cafe.
5382260	5383260	So, who am I?
5383260	5384260	Am I anybody?
5384260	5385260	You're Dan Harmon.
5385260	5386260	You're Dan Harmon.
5386260	5387260	You're Dan Harmon.
5387260	5388260	Or do you want to be Eric Simmons?
5388260	5389260	No, no.
5389260	5390260	Don't threaten me.
5390260	5391260	Are you a waiter?
5391260	5392260	Will you give me some help after this?
5392260	5393260	Can I make a pitch?
5393260	5394260	Make sure it's authentic.
5394260	5395260	Here's what I think.
5395260	5396260	Okay.
5396260	5397260	Any guidance?
5397260	5398260	I was a waiter in college.
5398260	5399260	Let me come show this.
5399260	5400260	I want...
5400260	5401260	Let's say that Dan, Jordy, Fred.
5401260	5402260	Dan, Jordy, and Fred.
5402260	5405580	Let's say that you invited Harmon to go do Hour of Goon and you guys said, let's get brunch
5405580	5407180	before or after or whatever.
5407180	5408540	You guys meet for brunch.
5408540	5410020	This is the three of you.
5410020	5413900	As much as you know each other right now, you've met for brunch.
5413900	5414900	And let's take...
5414900	5415900	It is 11 o'clock.
5415900	5416900	It's exactly 11 a.m.
5416900	5417900	Yeah.
5417900	5418900	11.
5418900	5421380	So, we're in a booth together at a restaurant.
5421380	5422380	Yes.
5422380	5423380	Like an Italian place?
5423380	5424380	That's it?
5424380	5425380	It's like a diner.
5425380	5426380	Just a basic diner.
5426380	5427380	That's it?
5427380	5428380	Hey, Lobot.
5428380	5429380	Do we all agree?
5429380	5430380	Lobot's dead?
5430380	5431380	Lobot's dead?
5431380	5432380	No, Lobot's dead.
5432380	5433380	Lobot's dead, yeah.
5433380	5437820	We're not going to the griddle or the waffle or any place where you have to stand in line.
5437820	5440420	Real quick, you just have a big poker face, right?
5440420	5441420	You're enjoying yourself, right?
5441420	5442420	Oh, yeah.
5442420	5443420	Okay, great.
5443420	5444420	Okay.
5444420	5445420	Wait, wait.
5445420	5446420	I always play to the...
5446420	5447420	I'm the same way.
5447420	5448420	Like, I just...
5448420	5450020	Like, you're in my line of sight and I'm like, this guy fucking hates me.
5450020	5451020	All right.
5451020	5452020	That's fine.
5452020	5453340	He looks like...
5453340	5456260	He looks like Jason Zadakis, but like tough guy mode.
5456260	5457260	Well, that's not...
5457260	5458260	No, I didn't want that to happen.
5458260	5459260	We're not going to start talking about you.
5459260	5460260	We're not going to start talking about you.
5460260	5461260	Hey, nice shirt.
5461260	5462260	What does Stevie Wonder have a yard sale?
5462260	5463260	Oh, shit.
5463260	5464260	Oh, shit.
5464260	5465260	All right.
5465260	5466260	All right.
5467140	5468140	All right.
5468140	5469140	Kind of a Potsy with a beard.
5469140	5470140	All right.
5470140	5471140	Okay.
5471140	5472140	All right.
5472140	5473140	Are we...
5473140	5474140	Have we just come into the 101 Cafe?
5474140	5475140	I want you guys to play this straight.
5475140	5476140	This is a real brunch scenario.
5476140	5477140	Grounded long-form improv that's...
5477140	5478140	We're at the 101 Cafe?
5478140	5479140	Yes.
5479140	5480140	All right.
5480140	5481140	We're at the 101 Cafe on Franklin.
5481140	5482140	Okay.
5482140	5488340	We now take you to an actual brunch between Fred Seblon, Jordie White, Dan Harmon, with
5488340	5497980	a neutral-empowered black waitress, 101 Cafe, 11 a.m. on the dot.
5497980	5498980	Okay.
5498980	5499980	What day is it?
5499980	5500980	It is...
5500980	5501980	Thursday.
5501980	5502980	Thursday.
5502980	5503980	Okay.
5503980	5504980	Thursday.
5504980	5507460	We're at the 101 Cafe on Franklin.
5507460	5508460	Thank you guys for...
5508460	5509460	Hey, guys.
5509460	5510460	Sit anywhere.
5510460	5511460	I'll be right with you.
5511460	5512460	Thanks for...
5512460	5513460	We're really excited to...
5513460	5514460	Hey, guys.
5514460	5515460	There's some waiters.
5515460	5516460	I'll be right...
5516460	5517580	Oh.
5517580	5518580	I have to pee.
5518580	5519580	Take a look at the menus.
5519580	5520580	I'll be back in a minute.
5520580	5521580	I'm really busy.
5521580	5522580	Dan, thanks for coming on the show.
5522580	5523580	I hope you want to...
5523580	5524580	I'm just updating my Instagram.
5524580	5525580	I'll be back in a moment.
5525580	5526580	All right.
5526580	5527580	That was great.
5527580	5528580	Thank you.
5528580	5529580	I just got my period.
5529580	5530580	I'm not coming to your table for at least 10 minutes.
5530580	5532580	Aisha, you're killing the brunch experiment, right?
5532580	5533580	Have you guys eaten?
5533580	5534580	I'm sorry.
5534580	5535580	I'm sorry.
5535580	5536580	I'm sorry.
5536580	5537580	Can we get some water?
5537580	5538580	This place is too wet to ever take your order.
5538580	5539580	I can't come to you.
5539580	5540580	The service is usually good here.
5540580	5541580	I don't know what's going on.
5541580	5542580	Can we get some water?
5542700	5544700	I'm building a diorama in my home.
5544700	5545700	Miss Tyler!
5545700	5546700	Miss Tyler!
5546700	5547700	Come into the kitchen right now.
5547700	5548700	I want to talk to you.
5548700	5549700	I'm making my own kombucha.
5549700	5550700	I can't serve you.
5550700	5554340	The other day my husband went down on me and it confused me.
5554340	5555340	I can't serve you.
5555340	5559340	We haven't decided if I'm black or cisgender.
5559340	5561540	I'll be right back.
5561540	5565100	We cut to a month later when she's fired and the people are having brunch.
5565100	5566100	I would love to take your order.
5566100	5567100	How are you doing today?
5567100	5568100	Oh, I'm doing good.
5568100	5569100	How are you?
5569100	5571220	Welcome to brunch at the 101 Cafe.
5571220	5575260	I've worked through some personal issues and I'm prepared to serve you.
5575260	5576260	Well, we're in no hurry.
5576260	5577540	But not serve you like a servant.
5577540	5581020	Just serve you in an egalitarian, we're on an equal level.
5581020	5582020	We never met you.
5582020	5583020	I'm going to graduate school.
5583020	5584020	What would you like?
5584020	5585020	We'll tip well.
5585020	5586020	Okay.
5586020	5587020	Go ahead and order quickly.
5587020	5588020	I've got to go in the bathroom.
5588020	5592700	Just for starters, I'm going to go for, I'll have a water and a Bloody Mary.
5592700	5594460	A water and a Bloody Mary, great.
5594460	5597660	It's always important to order an alcoholic beverage and a bit of hydration at the same
5597660	5598660	time.
5598660	5599660	Good choice.
5599660	5600660	What would you like?
5601100	5602100	I'd like to get the drink.
5602100	5603740	Don't let him validate your choices.
5603740	5604740	Make your own choices.
5604740	5608420	Brunch is your own, whatever you want.
5608420	5610300	You're Heisenberg-ing this principle right now.
5610300	5611660	Whatever you want is okay.
5611660	5612660	I believe in you.
5612660	5613660	I'm going to go with Arnold Palmer.
5613660	5614660	Nicely played, sir.
5614660	5615660	Yeah, Robert Palmer.
5615660	5616660	Is it Robert Palmer?
5616660	5620660	Well, that's one where I have on red lipstick and I dance poorly to shitty music.
5620660	5622660	But I'll bring you an Alderman Palmer.
5622660	5623660	Arnold Palmer.
5623660	5625660	Do you guys have a full bar?
5625660	5626660	Unfortunately, no.
5626660	5629660	But I can get you some really shitty mimosas in a pitcher.
5630660	5632660	It's beer and wine champagne.
5632660	5635660	We've got champagne, one wine cooler.
5635660	5637660	This guy's got a Bloody Mary.
5637660	5638660	I got a Bloody Mary.
5638660	5639660	Oh, yeah, we have Bloody Marys, too.
5639660	5640660	Yeah, okay.
5640660	5641660	So you have a full bar?
5641660	5642660	Picture of Bloody Marys.
5642660	5644660	Picture of mimosas.
5644660	5646660	Picture of kombucha that I made in my car.
5646660	5649660	But I can't get a cocktail?
5649660	5651660	Where do you think you are?
5651660	5653660	Was that kombucha running across your body?
5653660	5657660	Yes, right through in my vagina and into a crawler.
5657660	5660660	I'll take a mimosa.
5660660	5661660	Oh, right, a mimosa.
5661660	5662660	Mimosa, yeah.
5662660	5664660	Clearly, you never had a mimosa before.
5664660	5665660	Well, I was...
5665660	5666660	You're allowed to get vodka.
5666660	5667660	Hit this guy over here.
5667660	5668660	Okay, now...
5668660	5669660	Who's this guy?
5669660	5670660	I'm a guy over here in the...
5670660	5671660	So in my brain...
5671660	5672660	There's nobody in a...
5672660	5674660	Guy at the next table is criticizing us the whole time.
5674660	5676660	I'm getting them a pitcher of mimosas.
5676660	5677660	So listen to this, buddy.
5677660	5678660	Can I hold...
5678660	5679660	He's having a Bloody Mary.
5679660	5680660	Aisha, stand down.
5680660	5681660	Stand down.
5681660	5683660	Guys, I have seen study in 45 minutes.
5683660	5684660	Can we do this?
5684660	5686660	So can I give you what's going on in my brain right now?
5686660	5687660	Yes.
5687660	5688660	You've gotten your drinks.
5688660	5689660	Okay.
5689660	5690660	You have your drinks.
5690660	5691660	Here we go.
5691660	5694660	Well, Dan ordered a mimosa, so there's orange juice in that.
5694660	5695660	So maybe this is breakfast.
5695660	5696660	Would you like some orange juice, sir?
5696660	5697660	Here's your armor.
5697660	5698660	I'm thinking this.
5698660	5699660	Here's your armor, Palmer.
5699660	5700660	This is what's going on in my brain right now.
5700660	5701660	So I think you got orange juice.
5701660	5702660	Bloody Mary is breakfast to think of that.
5702660	5703660	It seems like you'd like some orange juice.
5703660	5704660	So why don't I bring you an orange juice along with your armor?
5704660	5705660	I think we're having breakfast.
5705660	5706660	Oh, no, thank you.
5706660	5707660	Are you sure?
5707660	5708660	Would you like some orange juice?
5708660	5715660	I feel like the Star Wars characters at the other table are talking about us.
5715660	5717660	You can have anything you want.
5717660	5718660	Okay.
5718660	5719660	So bring me an orange juice.
5719660	5720660	And a normal bottle.
5720660	5722660	It's a difficult time for the premise of the brunch conversation.
5722660	5724660	Just put them all in the same glass.
5724660	5726660	You want the Arnold Palmer with the orange juice in the same glass?
5726660	5727660	Yes.
5727660	5728660	I don't think you're going to like that.
5728660	5729660	It's all an OJ Simpson.
5729660	5730660	Are you crawling me?
5730660	5734660	I'll bring you an Arnold Palmer and an orange juice in if you'd like to make an OJ Simpson.
5734660	5738660	Aisha, we're trying to do a sociological study of the brunch conversation.
5738660	5739660	Hey, you guys.
5739660	5740660	I'm standing by.
5740660	5742660	There's Star Wars guys at the other table.
5742660	5747660	The construct that you guys are missing is if he wants an orange juice and a Bloody Mary
5747660	5752660	and an Arnold Palmer and a beer and a Punch in the Nuts, he can have all of those things
5752660	5753660	because it's brunch.
5753660	5755660	That's the nature of brunch.
5755660	5756660	All things are possible.
5756660	5758660	I just figured this out.
5758660	5759660	That's what I'm saying.
5759660	5761660	I just nailed it all.
5761660	5764660	Order pancakes and french fries and a burger and dessert.
5764660	5766660	This is why I am a boater.
5766660	5768660	Are we all boaters right now?
5768660	5770660	No, I'm in the back making kombucha.
5770660	5771660	Are you a waitress right now?
5771660	5772660	Wait, where are we going to take our orders?
5772660	5773660	Honestly.
5773660	5774660	Where is this girl?
5774660	5775660	What food can I eat?
5775660	5776660	What food can I eat?
5776660	5777660	Go ahead, Fred.
5777660	5778660	What do you want?
5778660	5779660	I'm going to have the breakfast burrito.
5779660	5780660	Oh, delicious.
5780660	5781660	That's breakfast and lunch at the same time.
5781660	5782660	Thanks.
5782660	5783660	What would you like?
5783660	5784660	That's why they call it breakfast.
5784660	5785660	You know what?
5785660	5786660	I just got the solution.
5786660	5787660	Okay.
5787660	5788660	Chicken and waffles.
5788660	5789660	Fantastic, sir.
5789660	5790660	Here we go.
5790660	5791660	A winning choice.
5791660	5792660	Chicken and waffles.
5792660	5793660	I believe in you deeply.
5793660	5795660	I just figured it out right now.
5795660	5796660	I got it.
5796660	5798660	Sir, what would you like for breakfast?
5799660	5802660	I'd like a 12 year old's private.
5809660	5810660	Queue transition.
5810660	5812660	It's a new segment.
5812660	5818660	I'd like 12 year old's private.
5818660	5820660	Back to the table.
5823660	5824660	Actually speaking of.
5824660	5826660	I'm sorry, an English muffin.
5826660	5827660	English muffin?
5827660	5829660	I've been thinking is brunch is prison.
5829660	5831660	So it's actually brunch is freedom.
5831660	5833660	Brunch is freedom, my friend.
5833660	5836660	Brunch is the only free meal of the week.
5836660	5839660	It's the only meal within you can fully express your desires.
5839660	5840660	I never thought.
5840660	5842660	Without judgment or recrimination.
5842660	5844660	The world is yours.
5844660	5845660	I never thought I'd meet anybody.
5845660	5847660	As Shaquille would say, twism.
5847660	5848660	The world is mine.
5848660	5850660	He says, twism.
5850660	5851660	You don't remember twism?
5851660	5853660	The world is mine.
5853660	5863660	But I never like brunch as the meal where you're free insinuates that.
5863660	5865660	The other meals you have, you're constrained.
5865660	5866660	What?
5866660	5867660	I don't understand why people do.
5867660	5868660	I love brunch so much.
5868660	5869660	Why?
5869660	5870660	It literally rules my week.
5870660	5871660	It's not a week.
5871660	5872660	Has everyone been eating?
5872660	5873660	Not a week.
5873660	5874660	Constrained meals?
5874660	5875660	Yes.
5875660	5876660	Yes.
5876660	5878660	Was that way everyone hates me?
5878660	5879660	Yes.
5879660	5882660	Try getting an egg McMuffin at noon.
5882660	5883660	Think about it this way.
5883660	5890660	When someone says I'm eating breakfast for dinner, the implication is I'm breaking the
5890660	5891660	rules, right?
5891660	5892660	Yes.
5892660	5893660	Oh, God.
5893660	5894660	I had pancakes dinner.
5894660	5895660	I'm out of control.
5895660	5896660	I ate zero for dinner.
5896660	5898660	I'm alone and nobody loves me.
5898660	5900660	But I think from listening to their show.
5900660	5902660	But when you can eat anything at brunch, you can eat anything.
5902660	5907660	From listening to Fred and Jordy's show, I think what you find out is that Jordy, you
5907660	5912740	have a little bit more social anxiety about am I stepping on somebody's toes, am I doing
5912740	5913740	this wrong, right?
5913740	5914740	Sure.
5914740	5919660	I thought I'm going to let you decide if this is going to be either breakfast or lunch.
5919660	5922660	Jeff is like, I'm going to put this back on the rails if it shows me.
5922660	5923660	No.
5923660	5924660	I'm going to stick with it.
5924660	5925660	Honestly.
5925660	5927660	And I'm going to dignify this evening.
5927660	5931260	Honestly, actually, the thing that I wanted to talk about just to kind of switch gears
5931260	5932260	a little bit.
5932260	5933660	This whole show's been about self.
5933660	5934660	Yes.
5935660	5937660	Well, to a fault.
5937660	5939660	Is that not the essence of the Harmon town?
5939660	5944160	When I told people that I was coming on the Harmon town, there were a couple of girls
5944160	5946660	that actually said, oh, Jeff Davis, oh, he's great.
5946660	5950660	But one specifically said, you know, he's hung like a horse.
5951660	5952660	Jeff Brian Davis.
5952660	5953660	That's true.
5953660	5954660	That's really true.
5954660	5955660	Yeah.
5955660	5962660	And the girl actually said she goes, he was so big, barely could fit and said that she
5963660	5966660	did pull ups by the pool using your dick.
5967660	5969660	That's what she told me.
5970660	5971660	It's all I'm just telling you right now.
5971660	5972660	It was you.
5972660	5977660	That was one thing that I actually wanted to think about because I would see you in your
5977660	5982660	suits and I realized that you're wearing pretty tight suits.
5982660	5984660	I feel like that's what I wanted to talk about.
5984660	5986660	Dan, has this been talked about on the show?
5986660	5987660	No.
5987660	5989660	Jeff's huge dick.
5989660	5990660	Yes.
5991660	5994660	No, it hasn't been talked about as such.
5995660	6004660	Fred, I could go on to argue that every fucking episode, one way or another, keeps coming
6004660	6010660	back around to it since we're all doing whatever the fuck we want tonight.
6010660	6012660	I mean, I got it.
6013660	6017660	I feel like I will remember somebody doing pull ups in a pool.
6017660	6018660	This is what was being told to me.
6019660	6021660	So I just wanted to bring it up and address it.
6021660	6023660	It's not ringing a bell right now.
6024660	6026660	But we know who we're talking about.
6029660	6031660	I showed you a picture and I said, this is the one.
6031660	6035660	I listened to your last podcast and you're like, I hope Jeff doesn't hear this so you
6035660	6036660	could bring it up.
6036660	6037660	I didn't think you would listen.
6037660	6039660	I'm a fan of your goddamn show.
6040660	6042660	Jeff, I'm talking about your penis.
6042660	6045660	Stop trying to turn this into something respectable.
6046660	6049660	You're like, guys, I love your show.
6049660	6050660	It doesn't stop it.
6050660	6052660	But just when I heard at that level, I was like, wow.
6052660	6053660	Are you looking for a clue?
6053660	6054660	Are you looking for clues?
6054660	6055660	Oh, he's enormous.
6056660	6057660	Oh, shit.
6057660	6058660	Do you guys know this?
6058660	6059660	No.
6059660	6060660	You're adorable.
6060660	6061660	Huh?
6061660	6062660	No.
6062660	6064660	It's uncomfortable, you guys.
6064660	6066660	Why are you uncomfortable?
6066660	6069660	They're going to be like zombies coming after you after this is over.
6069660	6074660	The problem is my dick, it's quite long, but it's shaped exactly like a treble cliff.
6076660	6079660	So, sex is almost impossible.
6080660	6082660	But it's nice because it's always a math problem.
6082660	6083660	How is this going to work?
6084660	6087660	Everybody turns into a blind person using Braille.
6087660	6088660	Okay.
6088660	6089660	It's always in the key of D.
6089660	6090660	Carry the one.
6097660	6098660	Wait, I didn't even...
6098660	6100660	I'm ashamed to admit I don't understand the...
6100660	6101660	Key of D?
6101660	6102660	Key of D.
6102660	6103660	Dick.
6103660	6104660	Right, no.
6104660	6105660	Yeah, that I get.
6106660	6107660	That was all that happened.
6107660	6108660	Oh, well, okay.
6108660	6110660	See, your problem is you're too complex of a finger, Dan.
6110660	6111660	I'm above it, yeah.
6111660	6112660	You thought there was more going on.
6112660	6117660	I thought it was like, is Key of D like a Motown, like...
6118660	6119660	Racist!
6120660	6122660	The opposite of racist.
6122660	6126660	I allow for the possibility of Motown, people we don't even know.
6127660	6130660	I'm constantly anticipating their existence.
6130660	6132660	That is the opposite of racist.
6133660	6135660	There might be a lady named T.F.D.
6136660	6138660	that I need to know.
6138660	6139660	Order.
6139660	6140660	Order in the court.
6140660	6141660	Order.
6141660	6145660	May I ask to deflect off of this shit?
6146660	6147660	Can I bring up with...
6147660	6149660	He's like, can you please stop talking about my penis?
6149660	6150660	I feel super uncomfortable.
6150660	6151660	When I did Hour of Goon...
6151660	6152660	I'm talking about my big dick.
6152660	6156660	When I did Hour of Goon, we just did all name-dropping stories and shit like that.
6156660	6160660	But you, Jordy, had a story about going to the Playboy Mansion.
6160660	6161660	Can you say that story?
6163660	6164660	Yeah, you like that story?
6164660	6167660	It's the greatest rock story I've ever heard, I think.
6167660	6168660	Okay.
6168660	6169660	I want to hear the story.
6169660	6170660	It's really not that fun.
6170660	6171660	Now you've got to build it up.
6171660	6173660	Can we crawl before it?
6173660	6178660	Could there be a fight between two characters in it with swords that glow?
6180660	6182660	I just talked about Dan and Rob.
6182660	6183660	And one of them used to be on Girls.
6183660	6189660	I just talked about the story of Dan and Rob getting high with Adam Carolla and meeting...
6190660	6191660	Hasselhoff.
6191660	6193660	Hasselhoff and that weird conversation.
6193660	6197660	And so that was my offering of my Playboy Mansion story.
6197660	6199660	And then Jordy goes, because I went there once, I think.
6199660	6202660	And just lay that on this piece.
6202660	6203660	It's not a long story.
6203660	6204660	It's just a fucking goodie.
6204660	6205660	Okay.
6205660	6208660	I'm a terrible storyteller, but I'll see if I can figure it out.
6208660	6214660	Years ago, when I used to do a lot of bad things, Dave Navarro and I were at his house.
6214660	6215660	Oh, I love Dave Navarro.
6215660	6216660	Sorry.
6216660	6218660	He's on my podcast next week.
6219660	6222660	The story's actually in his book, so it's not like I'm revealing anything.
6222660	6224660	He's a normal human being.
6224660	6230660	And people like you prevent him from being part of stories like this.
6230660	6231660	Yes.
6231660	6232660	Part of stories.
6232660	6233660	Anyway, he's amazing and he's on my podcast.
6233660	6234660	And back to you.
6234660	6235660	Anyways, we got a limo.
6235660	6236660	We're going to go to the Playboy Mansion.
6236660	6237660	My first time there.
6237660	6239660	He was probably there a million times.
6239660	6240660	Who knows?
6240660	6241660	But I was excited.
6241660	6242660	Oh, we're going to the Playboy Mansion.
6242660	6245660	We did some narcotics and we were drunk and very nervous.
6245660	6246660	No.
6246660	6249660	We were nervous because of the narcotics we were taking.
6249660	6251660	We get a limo and we hit traffic.
6251660	6253660	And we just want to get the fuck out of the car.
6253660	6256660	And it took us like three hours to get the Playboy Mansion with traffic.
6256660	6259660	As soon as we got there, it was like stop, start, stop, start, stop, start.
6259660	6260660	The Playboy Mansion has herpes.
6260660	6261660	Okay.
6261660	6262660	I know.
6262660	6263660	Yes, it does.
6263660	6264660	The whole house has herpes.
6264660	6266660	And crawling out of our skin to finally get to this place.
6266660	6270660	As soon as we get to the Playboy Mansion, we get up there, boom, walk in.
6270660	6271660	We're all excited.
6271660	6272660	There's girls everywhere.
6272660	6273660	We go.
6273660	6275660	We just make a beeline to the bathroom, right to the bathroom.
6276660	6277660	Oh, yeah.
6277660	6278660	Make a beeline to the bathroom.
6278660	6280660	At the time, I had long dreadlocks.
6280660	6286660	He ties off his arm with one of my dreadlocks and does for some reason because there was
6286660	6287660	... yeah.
6287660	6289660	Figure out why.
6289660	6290660	Figure out why.
6290660	6291660	It's like in the restaurant.
6291660	6294660	It's like, sir, if you're going to come in here, you need dreadlocks.
6294660	6296660	For some reason, he grabs my dreadlock and ties off one of his arms.
6296660	6297660	And I'm like, what are you doing?
6297660	6299660	Oh, you're doing ... oh, okay, cool.
6299660	6303660	He boots up using your dreadlock as a tie.
6303660	6304660	He is my tie.
6304660	6306660	What kind of heroin addict doesn't bring their own thing?
6306660	6307660	At least a shoelace.
6307660	6310660	Well, when you're friends with me, I mean, come on.
6310660	6312660	I got them coming out of my head.
6312660	6313660	It's already made.
6313660	6314660	Yes, yes, yes, anyways.
6314660	6315660	Life's about pivoting.
6315660	6316660	Just pivot, pivot, pivot.
6316660	6317660	That's all it's about.
6317660	6321660	I proceed to put some unknown substance up my nose.
6321660	6322660	Baking soda.
6322660	6323660	I can't have loads.
6323660	6324660	Baking soda that way.
6324660	6325660	Pixie stick.
6325660	6326660	Graping.
6326660	6329660	And then we are immediately filled with more panic.
6329660	6333660	We just look at each other, go, we got to get the fuck out of here immediately.
6333660	6338660	We left the thing, got right back in the limo, waited for another two hours going down
6338660	6341660	the hill, down the home, got back in, and went home.
6341660	6342660	That was it.
6342660	6345660	What did you leave out?
6345660	6346660	That was it.
6346660	6348660	What did you leave out?
6348660	6352660	Oh, you're talking about the girl who lost her purse and shit in the toilet?
6352660	6353660	That, that.
6353660	6356660	And he also said you guys sprayed the ceiling, didn't you?
6356660	6357660	Oh, yes.
6357660	6358660	Blood went everywhere because you guys ...
6358660	6360660	See, I kind of didn't want to ... I mean, the story's common knowledge.
6360660	6364660	You can't talk about your blood and your dreadlocks and boop and then not talk about the other stuff.
6364660	6367660	Bro, I was thinking about how he sprayed the blood on the thing and all that other stuff.
6367660	6368660	Trying to keep it classy.
6368660	6369660	Trying to keep it classy, guys.
6369660	6374660	Jordy, Jordy, I always say this to the young heroin addicts out there.
6374660	6380660	When you use your friend's dreadlock to tie off or to play by magic, untie before you take the needle out.
6380660	6383660	Otherwise, the blood's going to go all over the fucking floor.
6383660	6384660	No, no, no, no.
6384660	6385660	Well, yeah, because I actually want to stay.
6385660	6387660	He dragged me out because I was still stuck to his arm.
6388660	6391660	So you can understand the struggles of brunch at this point.
6391660	6393660	Hugs not drugs, America.
6393660	6394660	Exactly.
6394660	6396660	You have PTSD.
6396660	6398660	Hugs not drugs.
6398660	6401660	So what guys ... say no comment.
6401660	6403660	But you guys are rock and rollers.
6403660	6405660	Have you both done heroin?
6405660	6407660	Never.
6407660	6409660	That's not ironic. You've never done it.
6409660	6410660	I've never done it.
6410660	6411660	So you've ...
6411660	6412660	I've done everything at one point.
6412660	6413660	You've done including heroin?
6413660	6415660	Everything at one point, yeah.
6415660	6416660	I've done a bunch.
6416660	6417660	Nothing now.
6417660	6418660	Nothing but never heroin.
6418660	6419660	That's not a real ...
6419660	6420660	I mean, come on.
6420660	6422660	This is a good question, actually.
6422660	6427660	First of all, let me just say as a disclaimer, because I have a daytime show, don't do drugs.
6427660	6428660	I don't do drugs any more either.
6428660	6429660	Not during the daytime.
6429660	6430660	You'll go to sleep and you won't watch the show.
6430660	6432660	Yeah, usually, and then it ruins your night.
6432660	6438660	But I do feel like it's interesting, because for me, when I was growing up, and I did stuff,
6438660	6444660	because that's what you do when you're a teenager and a young adult, that heroin was the line for me.
6445660	6446660	And it was interesting.
6446660	6447660	I was afraid of it.
6447660	6448660	I had friends that did it.
6448660	6449660	And I had friends that shot up.
6449660	6454660	And I remember thinking, like, oh, everything else I can kind of play with, but that's a
6454660	6455660	thing I could never, ever try.
6455660	6456660	Yeah, exactly.
6456660	6457660	Yeah, because needles.
6457660	6458660	Gross.
6458660	6459660	No, I've never had a needle.
6459660	6460660	I could barely get a shot.
6460660	6461660	There was no needles.
6461660	6462660	Yeah, no needles to me.
6462660	6463660	That was the thing that you saw.
6463660	6467660	If you watched, I don't know, Christiane for any of the movies about heroin ...
6467660	6468660	Look at you.
6468660	6469660	Oh, you ...
6469660	6473660	That there were a few of those movies that you thought, if I tried that, I'm like,
6474660	6475660	I'm all in, right?
6475660	6476660	Like, I won't be able to pull that from that.
6476660	6477660	Right.
6477660	6479660	Is that why you didn't try it?
6479660	6480660	That's exactly it.
6480660	6482660	I just always thought that was a line that I didn't want to be a part of.
6482660	6485660	And you guys knew each other the whole time?
6485660	6486660	I didn't know him.
6486660	6487660	I snorted heroin.
6487660	6488660	Not that night.
6488660	6489660	That night we were doing cocaine.
6489660	6490660	No, no.
6490660	6493660	I want to talk about this now, because it's a fascinating ...
6493660	6495660	I mean, I've tried it, but that was the end of it.
6495660	6497660	Oh, that's a lot of fun.
6497660	6498660	Don't do heroin, Dan.
6498660	6499660	That's a lot of fun.
6499660	6500660	Maybe I shouldn't do that.
6500660	6501660	Dan, don't do heroin.
6501660	6502660	Dan, don't do heroin.
6502660	6503660	Don't do heroin.
6503660	6504660	I'm sober.
6504660	6505660	I don't do drugs or anything.
6505660	6508660	I knew that about you as soon as I knew that you were doing that.
6508660	6509660	I can tell.
6509660	6510660	I'm serious.
6510660	6511660	I can tell.
6511660	6512660	Don't do heroin.
6512660	6514660	In life, at this moment, I'm sober also.
6514660	6515660	But in life, I'm sober.
6515660	6516660	But in life, you're sober.
6516660	6517660	I knew that in the minute.
6517660	6518660	But it's a valuable line of questioning.
6518660	6520660	So can we talk ...
6520660	6522660	Dave is also clean as well right now.
6522660	6523660	Dave Pivarro's clean.
6523660	6524660	Yes, he is.
6524660	6529660	How did you encounter heroin and you snorted it, you never shot it?
6529660	6530660	I never shot it up, no.
6530660	6531660	I didn't.
6531660	6532660	Can you talk about something?
6532660	6533660	How, how, what happened?
6533660	6537660	I'm curious because I'm 43 and I was always like, I'm never going to do that now.
6537660	6541660	Well, one time it was like ... I thought it was cocaine and it was like a pulpit kind
6541660	6542660	of thing.
6542660	6543660	Oh, it was an accident.
6543660	6544660	That's how I did meth.
6544660	6545660	Yeah.
6545660	6546660	Oh, yeah.
6546660	6547660	That too, yeah.
6547660	6548660	I thought it was coke.
6548660	6549660	I thought it was ...
6549660	6552660	Somebody was like, here's a key load of ... and I was like, it's so shiny.
6552660	6553660	And then another time ...
6553660	6554660	Oh, boy.
6554660	6555660	Another time somebody handed me homework.
6555660	6556660	I put it in my nose.
6556660	6559660	And then sometimes someone handed me something and goes, hey, try this out.
6559660	6560660	I'm like, what is it?
6560660	6561660	And I go, it's not heroin.
6561660	6562660	He goes, no, you'll like it.
6562660	6563660	It's good.
6563660	6564660	And then I went and did.
6564660	6565660	I came back.
6565660	6566660	Dude, this is ...
6566660	6567660	Never do anything.
6567660	6568660	Someone says, no, you'll like it.
6568660	6569660	It's good.
6569660	6571820	I won't eat a salad if someone's like, no, you'll like it.
6571820	6572820	It's good.
6572820	6573820	It's not for me.
6573820	6574820	It was not my thing.
6574820	6575820	I mean ...
6575820	6576820	What's the point?
6576820	6580820	I wanted to stay up and not have a hard on and be really in panic and not sleep forever.
6580820	6581820	Yeah.
6581820	6582820	I beg your friends to take you to the hospital.
6582820	6583820	Be really horny.
6583820	6584820	Yeah.
6584820	6585820	That was my thing.
6585820	6586820	Yeah.
6586820	6587820	Not feel good and go to sleep.
6587820	6588820	I want to feel more terrible than I already do.
6588820	6589820	Yeah.
6589820	6590820	Have you ever smoked crack?
6590820	6591820	You know why?
6591820	6592820	I smoked crack.
6592820	6593820	I've tried it before.
6593820	6594820	This is the best episode of Heart of Cali and Ever.
6594820	6595820	Again, I am clean and sober.
6595820	6596820	I don't do that.
6596820	6597820	You guys ...
6597820	6598820	I smoked crack with a Hari Krishna once, okay?
6598820	6599820	It's not that ...
6599820	6600820	I thought it was ...
6600820	6601820	The Hari Krishna ...
6601820	6602820	Wait, what?
6602820	6603820	No, no, no.
6603820	6604820	That never happened.
6604820	6605820	Okay.
6605820	6606820	I just gave you guys a real ...
6606820	6607820	He doesn't do drugs.
6607820	6608820	I'm backed out doesn't do drugs.
6608820	6609820	I just gave you guys a real ...
6609820	6610820	No, no, no.
6610820	6611820	Never happened.
6611820	6612820	Okay.
6612820	6613820	No.
6613820	6614820	I just gave you guys a real ...
6614820	6615820	He doesn't do drugs.
6615820	6616820	I'm backed out doesn't do drugs.
6617820	6618820	I just gave you guys a real Arab goon.
6618820	6619820	Wait, what?
6619820	6620820	What?
6620820	6621820	No.
6621820	6622820	War audience guy.
6622820	6623820	That's amazing.
6623820	6625820	How do we get talking about drugs?
6625820	6629820	Under what circumstances do you meet a Hari Krishna that wants to smoke crack?
6629820	6630820	Oh, he was my dealer.
6630820	6631820	Oh, he was all want to die.
6631820	6632820	He was your dealer?
6632820	6633820	Yeah.
6633820	6634820	They're like, look at my outfit.
6634820	6635820	For real.
6635820	6636820	I'm not even kidding.
6636820	6637820	Stop this noise.
6637820	6638820	You think I'm kidding.
6638820	6639820	I'm not.
6639820	6640820	I'm not getting that up.
6640820	6641820	He was.
6641820	6644820	He was a little more Hari, not so much Krishna, you know what I mean?
6644820	6645820	A lot of Hari.
6645820	6649820	Fred, was it you that told the story about going to Wilt Chamberlain's crib?
6649820	6650820	I did.
6650820	6651820	I went to Wilt Chamberlain's house.
6651820	6652820	He was already dead.
6652820	6653820	Ooh.
6653820	6654820	But his house is for the first time.
6654820	6655820	So you murdered him.
6655820	6657820	Wilt Chamberlain's house also has your piece.
6657820	6658820	Are you encyclopedic and proud?
6658820	6659820	And it got in from the Playboy mansion.
6659820	6660820	I went to Wilt Chamberlain's house.
6660820	6661820	He was already dead.
6661820	6662820	Yeah.
6662820	6665820	You're describing the cold open of a mystery.
6665820	6667820	No, he's ...
6667820	6668820	I did.
6668820	6669820	I went to Wilt Chamberlain's house.
6669820	6671820	And he was dead.
6671820	6673820	He was not alive at this point.
6673820	6674820	Yes.
6674820	6675820	I did.
6675820	6676820	Yes.
6676820	6677820	That's murder, she wrote.
6677820	6678820	2011.
6678820	6679820	People were throwing parties at his old house.
6679820	6681820	No, that's touched by an angel, Dan.
6681820	6685820	People were throwing parties at Wilt Chamberlain's house after he had died.
6685820	6686820	Okay.
6686820	6687820	All right.
6687820	6688820	Okay.
6688820	6690820	And like all this stuff with his still there, his clothes, his porn bags.
6690820	6691820	But not his body.
6691820	6693820	And he had an orgy room.
6693820	6695820	An absolute fact with a water bed.
6695820	6696820	Oh, God.
6696820	6697820	He was not that hot, though.
6697820	6699820	That was like a circular room with a mirror and a water bed in the center.
6699820	6701820	And some of them was two-way mirrors.
6701820	6703820	Well, some of it was what?
6703820	6705820	And I did do drugs there.
6705820	6706820	At the time.
6706820	6707820	This is the greatest night of my life.
6707820	6711820	You saw something happening in the pool outside.
6711820	6714820	Yeah, actually, at the pool, he had a ...
6714820	6716820	You should get this kind of place.
6716820	6719820	It had a swimming pool that you could enter from inside the house.
6719820	6721820	You don't know that I don't have that.
6721820	6722820	That is true.
6722820	6724820	From what we hear about him, he should.
6724820	6728820	But he had a swimming pool that you could get in and it had a grotto and everything.
6728820	6730820	And there was a ...
6730820	6732820	The grotto's where the herpes is.
6732820	6733820	There was a girl.
6733820	6735820	There were two girls that were kind of going at it.
6735820	6736820	And there was a third guy.
6736820	6743820	There was a third person, a guy who was going down on the girls and he was on his cell phone.
6743820	6746820	On his cell phone, going down on the girls at the same time?
6746820	6748820	Was it an old school flip phone or was it an iPhone?
6748820	6751820	Can he have that phone that Elaine has that you can pour champagne on?
6751820	6753820	No.
6753820	6755820	That sounds incredible.
6755820	6756820	That is weird.
6756820	6761820	If I got to the point where I was eating that much pussy, I would cast that white a nut.
6761820	6763820	I would be like, hello?
6763820	6764820	Wait.
6764820	6766820	Where are my next five pussies?
6766820	6772820	I would be sure that one of one can't pay for some pancakes and a breakfast burrito.
6772820	6774820	I just got to bust this pussy for a minute.
6774820	6775820	CAA is calling.
6775820	6782820	They're like, hey, J.J. Abrams wants you to eat a pussy on the Batman set.
6782820	6787820	Batman versus pussy is the sequel.
6787820	6789820	I guess I'm obsessed with this.
6790820	6796820	The reason why I'm asking is because we're older.
6796820	6798820	We've done everything that we want.
6798820	6800820	I'm young and beautiful, by the way.
6800820	6803820	You have done something that I've never done.
6803820	6811820	You've broached this threshold where it didn't involve needles,
6811820	6814820	which the rest of us go like, oh, needles, that's where I'll draw the line.
6814820	6816820	But it's not true.
6816820	6820820	This starts with heroin as a thing you can snort.
6820820	6824820	The reason why I actually am interested in hearing you talk about it
6824820	6826820	wants to know where to get it.
6826820	6834820	It's because the legacy is like Nancy Reagan going, everybody say no.
6834820	6837820	But the thing is, we're hanging out.
6837820	6842820	It would be valuable, actually, if you go, here's what the high is like.
6842820	6845820	Here's what happens after that.
6845820	6846820	Whatever.
6846820	6850820	It doesn't have to be a PSA.
6850820	6854820	If you're going to go there, like for heroin or crack or whatever,
6854820	6856820	that wasn't the first thing that you were doing.
6856820	6857820	Something led to that.
6857820	6858820	It was like, okay, I'm drunk.
6858820	6860820	Now I've got to do this and I've got to do that.
6860820	6862820	Now I've got to take it to the next level.
6862820	6864820	So who knows?
6864820	6869820	I think it was itchy and it was constipated.
6869820	6871820	I talked about this with Dave, too,
6871820	6874820	which was like the difference between someone who...
6874820	6876820	Look, lots of people never ever try drugs
6876820	6879820	or drink recreationally and never have an issue, right?
6879820	6882820	Some people fall into that well and they have to dig their way back out.
6882820	6886820	And everybody who hasn't fallen into that well and worries about it
6886820	6890820	wonders what was the thing that made you fall all the way down.
6890820	6895820	And I guess the question I asked him was, what was that feeling?
6895820	6896820	What was that thing?
6896820	6900820	And he said, look, I just think some people are predisposed to falling
6900820	6901820	and some people are not.
6901820	6905820	And maybe the question also was like, what was the appeal?
6905820	6906820	What was the moment?
6906820	6909820	What was the thing that you thought, okay, I'm going to go all the way in
6909820	6910820	versus the rest of us?
6910820	6912820	And I think there were a lot of people who were like, oh, I got high in high school
6912820	6914820	or I smoked up every once in a while on the weekends
6914820	6917820	or I have a medicinal marijuana card and I get a brownie every once in a while,
6917820	6918820	but I'm not...
6918820	6922820	Yeah, okay, that guy right there loves dope.
6922820	6924820	But you didn't go all the way in.
6924820	6925820	I think that's what's interesting.
6925820	6927820	You did go all the way in because you're sober now.
6927820	6929820	No, no, no, he didn't graduate.
6929820	6930820	It just stopped working.
6930820	6931820	It stopped working for you.
6931820	6932820	Yeah, mostly booze.
6932820	6934820	Booze was the thing that took me down.
6934820	6937820	The drugs are just so I could drink more.
6937820	6940820	And yeah, I just hit a wall and said, I can't do this anymore
6940820	6942820	and I thought it would be really difficult to not do that anymore.
6942820	6945820	Did you do a program thing or did you just do it on your own?
6945820	6948820	Jeff needs to know where your meeting is.
6948820	6949820	Yeah, I could take you.
6949820	6952820	Yeah, well, by saying I'm not supposed to talk about it, you can figure it out.
6952820	6953820	Hi, guys.
6953820	6954820	I'm Jeff by the name.
6954820	6959820	But I mean, I wouldn't trade all the years of partying for the world.
6959820	6962820	It was fantastic and a lot of fun.
6962820	6965820	But it's also a lot of fun not doing that too.
6965820	6967820	Do you find, because I felt like that asshole,
6967820	6970820	I felt like that cousin or that aunt or that grandmother with Dave
6970820	6973820	when we had this conversation where I was like almost asking him the question
6973820	6975820	of like, tell me what not to do.
6975820	6976820	Do you know what I mean?
6976820	6977820	Like...
6977820	6978820	Oh, do it all.
6978820	6979820	Yeah, well, yeah.
6979820	6981820	Yeah, like, you know, like, I don't...
6982820	6984820	I think drugs and alcohol are fantastic.
6984820	6986820	I mean, it's really fucking wonderful.
6986820	6989820	But it's just, it's now it's the time.
6989820	6991820	At some point it worked and then it didn't work.
6991820	6995820	Well, you get older and then if you feel shittier and then like it's just,
6995820	6998820	you know, you want to go out and do cool shit and it's just not...
6998820	6999820	I wasn't able to do that anymore.
6999820	7000820	That's the bummer, right?
7000820	7004820	Like in your 20s, you can just go all night and rally on 45 minutes
7004820	7007820	and then you turn 35 and you're like, oh, I shouldn't have had that second glass
7007820	7008820	of red wine.
7009820	7010820	I think I'm having a heart attack.
7010820	7011820	Like that literally is the thing.
7011820	7012820	Like all of a sudden you're like...
7013820	7018820	Actually, the reason why, because I had done the cocaine in the past
7018820	7020820	and why stopped?
7020820	7024820	No, but why stopped was actually, I thought I had tonight is really bad
7024820	7027820	because it was making my ears ring terribly.
7027820	7029820	And I honestly was like...
7029820	7032820	Oh, you knew I was doing so much coke that your ears were ringing?
7032820	7033820	Yeah.
7033820	7034820	You're rich.
7034820	7037820	No, but honestly, that was like...
7037820	7038820	I was like...
7038820	7039820	Someone's doing a lot of...
7039820	7041820	Wait, is your dealer a Hare Krishna guy?
7041820	7043820	Oddly, no.
7043820	7044820	Mine really was.
7044820	7046820	Because they got those bells, you know.
7046820	7049820	But anyways, I mean, but it was like...
7049820	7052820	That scared the shit out of me more than like anything else.
7052820	7054820	So like, I was like, I can't even...
7054820	7057820	I'm like laying here feeling like I just went to a fucking concert
7057820	7060820	and it's like I can't deal, so...
7060820	7061820	Let's do the thing.
7061820	7062820	No more.
7062820	7064820	I just have a hard enough time to smoke a lot of weed.
7064820	7065820	Without drugs.
7065820	7066820	Right, right.
7066820	7067820	You know what I mean?
7067820	7068820	It's like...
7068820	7069820	It's bad enough.
7069820	7072820	But there's that thing about like what knowing, like what the essential knowledge
7072820	7074820	of knowing that you're going to die does to you, right?
7074820	7075820	We were talking about this in the show.
7075820	7077820	It does different things to different people.
7077820	7079820	For some people, it does the thing where you think,
7079820	7081820	well, I'm just going to burn this place to the ground.
7081820	7082820	I don't care.
7082820	7083820	I'm going to wreck my body.
7083820	7084820	I'm going to wreck my soul.
7084820	7085820	I'm going to go crazy, right?
7085820	7086820	That sounds so much fun.
7086820	7088820	Yeah, it does sound like a good time, doesn't it?
7088820	7089820	That sounds great.
7089820	7091820	Some people, you have your friend, they're like, I'm vegan
7091820	7093820	and I drink green juice and I get 10 hours of...
7093820	7094820	That's what a hide-and-go-seek is, by the way.
7094820	7095820	It's getting fucked up on reality.
7095820	7096820	Right, yeah.
7096820	7097820	You can't see me.
7097820	7099820	I'm hiding and you're seeking me.
7099820	7100820	Right, right.
7100820	7101820	It's all drugs.
7101820	7102820	Everybody kind of has this different response.
7102820	7103820	I'm going to get wasted.
7103820	7106820	I'm going to only drink green juice and sleep 10 hours a day.
7106820	7109820	I'm going to jump out of planes.
7109820	7111820	I mean, like all of that is a response to mortality.
7111820	7112820	What do you...
7112820	7113820	Rain juice?
7113820	7114820	You mean water?
7114820	7115820	Green juice, green juice, green juice.
7115820	7116820	Oh, I...
7116820	7117820	Like your friend, like your friend that's a vegan
7117820	7119820	that always drinks their fucking green juice and you're like...
7119820	7121820	People can't just do things normally.
7121820	7122820	Right.
7122820	7124820	Like even if I don't put that stuff in my body anymore,
7124820	7127820	I have a house full of Star Wars toys that I can stuff on.
7127820	7128820	Right, right, right.
7128820	7129820	Or I got like, you know, it's like...
7129820	7131820	Do you think it's just artists that do this?
7131820	7132820	Do you think it's just...
7132820	7135820	Or not just artists, but like a certain kind of artistic mentality
7135820	7137820	where you're like, I've got to go crazy on something?
7137820	7139820	Blues, music, art.
7139820	7141820	Obsessive compulsive behavior.
7141820	7142820	Self-obsession.
7142820	7143820	You know, it's other things.
7143820	7147820	And he's got a channel in it into one area, you know?
7147820	7149820	I feel that there's a need to say to...
7149820	7151820	I exhaust everything that I get into.
7151820	7153820	Yeah, because like we're all going to die.
7153820	7155820	That could be a good thing that now.
7155820	7156820	If you're going to do it, do it right.
7156820	7158820	Don't even bring attention.
7158820	7160820	Don't even bring attention.
7160820	7161820	We're doing our own thing.
7161820	7163820	Yeah.
7163820	7166820	The whole time we're talking, I just look it over these two,
7166820	7167820	just like look into it.
7167820	7169820	They're like, yeah, right. Okay.
7169820	7174820	Listen, if there's kids listening and there are...
7174820	7176820	Please don't let there be.
7176820	7177820	Oh, my God.
7177820	7178820	There always are.
7178820	7180820	Is that your demographic?
7180820	7184820	In the 80s, we had an institutionalized policy
7184820	7186820	which turned out to be very flawed
7186820	7189820	where you just had this unilateral policy.
7189820	7194820	The thing that we've never said is drugs exist.
7194820	7196820	People take them to feel good.
7196820	7200820	You may have a different experience than anyone else has.
7200820	7203820	Like they are out there in the world.
7203820	7204820	Right.
7204820	7207820	Therefore, it's up to you to know
7207820	7212820	when you personally are being hurt by them
7212820	7214820	or are being consumed by them
7214820	7216820	because your best friend might have a hollow leg.
7216820	7218820	It's so, so true.
7218820	7220820	You're trying to keep up with him.
7220820	7222820	No, but I totally agree.
7222820	7227820	The idea that this is not a validation of drug use.
7227820	7228820	Drugs are bad.
7228820	7230820	Even when they're good, they're still bad.
7230820	7233820	But the idea is know yourself
7233820	7235820	and your sense of your place in the world
7235820	7237820	and realize that no matter how many drugs you do,
7237820	7239820	you still have to be on this planet.
7239820	7241820	You still got to figure out who you are.
7241820	7243820	You still got to live here.
7243820	7247820	The drugs are only going to push that away for a moment.
7247820	7250820	They don't fix the essential nature of being human,
7250820	7252820	which is shit is fucked up
7252820	7255820	and you've got to be here and that shit is painful
7255820	7256820	and find a way through it
7256820	7259820	that doesn't involve exterior influences.
7259820	7261820	Because you've just got to live.
7261820	7262820	That's a deal.
7262820	7264820	And honestly, you're missing a lot of brunch.
7264820	7265820	Yeah.
7265820	7266820	And go to brunch.
7266820	7268820	And the stakes have never been higher at those brunches.
