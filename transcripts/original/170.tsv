0	11640	From Hollywood, California, at Nerdmelt Comics in the meltdown cedar of the melty-gist comic
11640	19880	bookstore where the downs have melted, Harman Town is now in session.
19880	20880	Wowee.
20880	27200	We got a real crowd in our hands.
28200	29200	Let's get Spencer Crittenden out here.
29200	30200	Spencer.
39200	42200	How about the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
48200	50200	Thank you very much.
52200	53200	Thank you.
54200	56200	Very, very, very nice people.
57200	59200	This is a boisterous crowd we have here tonight.
59200	64200	They're supportive, and therefore they're good.
64200	67200	It's called conditional love.
69200	73200	All right, so I don't have a lot to talk about.
73200	79200	Although there is one thing that I was having a conversation on Twitter that I keep realizing,
79200	80200	I never bring this up.
80200	88200	Remember a long, long time ago, in an episode called I Make a Five Stars, I told that story
88200	91200	about the guy, I got dropped off by an Uber guy, and I was like, thank you very much,
91200	94200	and he goes, I make a five stars.
94200	96200	And I was like, that was so weird.
96200	99200	He's like a little Mario character.
99200	105200	And then this happened a long time ago, but I keep on, you know, my brain, as you get older,
105200	108200	you know, it just becomes a bucket with no bottom.
108200	112200	It's just like a tube where you kind of feel things as it goes through.
112200	114200	And you don't remember a lot.
114200	121200	So I totally forgot that I never shared this with you guys, that I got dropped off a second time.
121200	126200	And hey, how you doing?
126200	129200	You've been like a million years since you've been here.
129200	132200	Carlos Jesus.
133200	135200	I'm not racist.
136200	137200	No.
137200	138200	It's just been that long.
138200	139200	I'm intuitive.
139200	141200	I'm not racist.
143200	145200	Carlos Jesus.
145200	147200	Charlie Jesus is here tonight, everybody.
151200	153200	I am nomenclaturely racist.
153200	156200	I was like, Carlos Jesus, what's the difference?
156200	158200	I don't, yeah, I'll cop to that.
158200	161200	I will not cop to what that sounded like, like I looked at his face.
161200	164200	It was like, it's either Carlos or Jesus, right?
166200	170200	Anyways, where was I?
170200	175200	Oh, I got dropped off by another Uber driver.
175200	177200	Yeah, by a different guy.
177200	183200	And he had his phone on like a holder.
183200	186200	Good night, folks.
186200	187200	Forget it.
187200	188200	Forget it.
188200	190200	It was like, you know, it was mounted on the dash.
190200	193200	And so at this time I saw, and he said the same thing.
193200	197200	He goes, I remember now, he was dropping off at the airport and he goes,
197200	198200	thank you very much.
198200	200200	I make five stars.
200200	204200	And as he said it, he gave me five stars on his app.
204200	207200	Oh, so the other guy.
207200	209200	I make a five stars.
209200	214200	He wasn't, it wasn't like Luigi going like, I make a five stars.
214200	217200	He was like, I make a five stars for you.
217200	218200	I make a pizza.
218200	220200	I make a sandwich for you.
220200	222200	I make a five stars.
223200	226200	For me, you make a five stars.
226200	227200	It was like a beauty.
227200	228200	Yeah.
228200	229200	Now it all of a sudden made sense.
229200	230200	All right.
230200	233200	I had a guy last night say literally, now please give me five stars.
233200	235200	Like he just said it straight up.
235200	239200	You got to admire the, I don't know if I should call it naivete.
239200	244200	Like the star system, how is this working?
244200	249200	Like you got to admire the pluck because of the people who actually are like,
249200	250200	you know what?
250200	255200	I have been told to value the stars that that is like a sub currency.
255200	259200	And I will, oh my God, it's already nine 11.
259200	270200	We didn't, it's, I mean, no guys, we fell back a tower last night.
270200	271200	I don't know.
271200	272200	It's not, yes, you're right.
272200	273200	No, I agree with you.
273200	277200	It's not, it stops being funny when it stops being about the number and about
277200	280200	the significance or whatever, whenever it becomes anything specific.
280200	281200	It's like gross.
281200	282200	I would deserve it.
282200	287200	If someone stood up and said, my dad died an hour ago.
287200	295200	Uh, so anyways, so, um, uh, wait, wait, what were you talking about?
295200	296200	Uh, make a five stars.
296200	297200	No, no, no.
297200	300200	We were done with that, but have we moved on?
300200	301200	Have we?
301200	302200	I think we did.
302200	303200	We move on.
303200	306200	Well, no, you were talking about the pluck of people.
306200	307200	Oh, the star system.
307200	308200	What is that?
308200	309200	I don't get it.
309200	310200	Why do I have 4.8 stars?
310200	311200	I'll tell you why.
311200	314960	Cause cause obviously you can't, you can never Trump capitalism.
314960	315960	This is the problem.
315960	316960	I agree.
316960	319080	We need a star system.
319080	320240	We need Yelp for people.
320240	322160	I wouldn't even kick that thing out of bed.
322160	326840	The, the, the, the, the meow meow be saying, because what we need is a moral code.
326840	331680	We need like a fucking like Jedi code, but that, that so that money can just be about
331680	332680	money.
332680	336760	I think it'd be like, like, oh, if, if you want a bigger car, if you want to get to
336760	343320	work faster, if you want your shoes to be made out of licorice, I don't, I don't know
343320	347720	a lot about I see how you connect those dots.
347720	351640	Then you use this thing called money and that's like a thing that you use as a medium of exchange.
351640	355080	Most of those freemium games have two forms of currency.
355080	357400	They're using it to like, you know, fuck you over.
357400	360720	Cause if you had just had one, you could figure out how to funnel it all into one and you
360720	363320	could beat the whole system.
363320	366220	Capitalism is based on one form of currency, which is the dollar.
366220	367480	You introduce these stars.
367480	368480	Here's the problem.
368480	372000	So these guys, they're told you're not supposed to accept tips, right?
372000	375880	But somebody's tipping them and that's why they keep getting out and like wanting to
375880	381680	open the door because that's when they get the tip because somebody's tipping them.
381680	384200	I use, that's why I have 4.8 stars.
384200	386880	I use lift and they never get out of the car to open.
386880	388440	I want to talk to you about lift.
389120	391320	We're talking in circles.
391320	393520	But a lot of, a lot of lift drivers are also Uber drivers.
393520	395520	They all have this Uber sticker in their window.
395520	396520	They're all moonlight.
396520	397760	And it's all unregulated and dangerous.
397760	398760	I have a question, Dan.
398760	400200	Did you go out last night for Halloween?
400200	401680	No, your back has been hurting you.
401680	403240	You did a show last night for Shrom, right?
403240	406960	Yeah, I did a show last night.
406960	407960	Yes.
407960	411040	I went to, I went to a show, but I happened to, I drove through West Hollywood.
411040	412880	So I saw a lot of people dressed up.
412880	415160	There were a million people dressed up as bananas last night.
415160	417080	Did you guys, is anybody else?
417080	421520	I saw, I mean, I saw groups of bananas, like a bunch of bananas walking around, which I
421520	423160	go, okay, there are a bunch of bananas.
423160	426600	But also I saw a bunch of singular bananas all night long.
426600	427840	I thought you were going to say cops.
427840	435880	I was blown away, no pun intended, by how many fucking fake, all right, you know what?
435880	438520	Fuck you, pun intended.
438520	440640	Suck on it.
440640	441640	Good pun.
441640	444040	Here's some other things I intended.
444040	445040	Community, Rick and Morty.
445040	447360	Go fuck yourself.
447360	462880	And that pun, three, my trilogy, to your legacy, George Lucas without a cause.
462880	470520	But no, I saw so many drunk cop, not real cops, like fratty dudes, just like, this will
470520	471520	be a fun costume.
471520	475200	And I'm not saying you're a bad person for picking a costume.
475200	479760	I'm just like, are you insane?
479760	484840	They are shooting people for carrying towels on not Halloween.
484840	488160	You are dressed as a fucking cop with a gun on your head.
488160	491560	But are they going with the safest costume of all time?
491560	493680	You think the cops are just like, oh, he's fine.
493680	497400	No, I mean, this happened a couple of Halloweens ago.
497400	500680	There was that party.
500680	502360	There was a fracas or something happened.
502360	503720	The neighbors called the police.
503720	505220	The cops came to the door.
505220	511240	One of the guys in the party was dressed as a cop, had a gun, was like, you know, I'll
511240	512600	take care of this or whatever.
512600	516640	And the cops are like, bang, boom, bang, boom, boom, boom, boom.
516640	518840	I don't mean to glorify it.
518840	521840	Boom, boom, boom, bang, bow.
521840	527160	The hammer, the trigger, everybody's bigger than life.
527960	531240	Yeah, you applaud my choice of rhyme.
531240	532200	Now who's racist?
535200	536200	Yeah, I just got this crazy.
536200	538320	I was like, I barely went out in public.
538320	540800	And I encountered so many dudes.
540800	544720	There was one guy that was outside the silent movie theater.
544720	546520	I was talking to some guys.
546520	548520	And a window rolled down.
548520	551640	And a guy went, hey, guys, and looked over.
551640	556960	And it just looked like Michael Cera dressed as a cop.
557160	560720	Just a young-looking guy.
560720	561840	I was just dressed as a cop.
561840	565880	I was like, hey, you're in arrest for partying.
565880	567880	Where's the party?
567880	570520	And he was like, was that Andy Dick?
570520	572680	He was just out of his mind.
572680	577120	And he was wearing a badge that said, you know, Pee Wee Academy.
577120	578800	But you know, Betty had a guy.
578800	580800	I'm just saying, like, holy shit, man.
580800	584440	Also, I went to the Hollywood Bowl last night to see the Danny Elfman Nightmare Before
584440	585760	Christmas thingy.
585840	587320	Anybody go to that?
587320	589520	Nope.
589520	590240	It's going on right now.
590240	591640	I think they're doing two nights.
591640	593880	So get over there.
593880	596400	And one of those things, I was pretty surprised.
596400	600040	Yeah, you saw a lot of Jack Skellington's and Sally's.
600040	603520	But there was more Beetlejuices than anybody else.
603520	608080	There was a lot of Beetlejuices at the Nightmare Before Christmas.
608080	610000	That was pretty funny.
610000	614280	It's like, guys are a little too old or not thin enough to be Jack Skellington.
615280	619040	I used to be Jack Skellington like five years ago, man.
619040	622920	But now it's like, that's a hard one to pull off.
622920	623920	He's pretty thin.
623920	626120	He's a Skellington.
628120	629120	I met Danny Elfman.
629120	630120	Oh, yeah, did you?
630120	631120	Yeah.
631120	632120	The end.
632120	634360	He was very nice.
634360	635360	What kind of party was it?
635360	636360	Did you have to leave your body at the door?
636360	637360	I did.
637360	644200	But the thing was, can we get a camera on this guy?
645120	647600	Find your cameras, Dan.
647600	653600	Find your camera.
653600	655760	He sang the song.
655760	661520	He sang all the Jack Skellington parts throughout the, like they played, the orchestra played
661520	663000	to the movie.
663000	666600	And Pete Herman came out and Catherine O'Hara came out and Greg Pribs was there, that's
666600	668080	why I got to go.
668080	672000	And so they all sang their bits from the movie.
672000	676440	And at the end, he came out with a guitar on and everybody flipped out and he goes,
676440	678560	I said I would never do this.
678560	681040	It's been 20 years since I played this to the day.
681040	684160	And he was like, I was never going to sing this fucking song again.
684160	690120	And he sang Dead Man's Party and it got off to kind of a rocky start.
690120	692520	Does anyone know why he would make a promise like that?
692520	694200	I think it was like, he's like sick of that man.
694200	698800	I got the impression that song was he was sick of playing it.
698800	700800	On Halloween, especially probably.
700880	707480	I get sick of stuff, but I don't always go like, like, here I go again.
707480	712400	I'm honest, I'd never jerk off in this position.
712400	717480	I swore it.
717480	718480	You're welcome.
718480	723760	I have returned.
723760	724760	One knee.
724760	728000	Edge of the bed.
728000	729000	Lamp shade.
729120	730760	You kneel on one knee?
730760	733160	I promised I would never would.
733160	735640	Since the 1989 disc slip.
735640	737680	When you said that you're a kneeler, when you jerk off, I always thought you were like
737680	743320	in a very supplicant, both knees, you know, pale Mary full of grace kind of thing.
743320	747880	I painted myself into a corner about like, how many positions could you jerk off in?
747880	748880	Okay, I gotcha.
748880	750560	And which one would you get tired of and then return?
750560	755000	So now I'm picturing you in a full t-bow, you know, on one knee.
756000	767000	Yeah, that takes too much time.
767000	771000	That's why you subscribe to the show so you can see that visual company.
771000	773000	Yeah, for those of you listening to the free podcast.
773000	775320	Five dollars buys you the worst visual of your life.
775320	778240	I jerky-afflected.
778240	779240	You can figure it out.
779240	782160	All right, so I know.
782160	783960	Spencer, did you dress up last night?
783960	784960	Did you do anything for Halloween?
784960	785960	Oh, no.
785960	786960	Oh, no.
786960	787960	Do you ever dress up for Halloween?
787960	788960	Not often.
788960	789960	I don't do much.
789960	792960	What was the last Halloween costume that you can recall that you wore?
792960	793960	Oh, dear.
793960	794960	I don't know.
794960	800280	This seems like a painful place for you.
800280	802960	Yeah, well, it was like my whole life.
802960	806800	It's been all like, oh, I guess like no one's doing anything this Halloween.
806800	807960	I guess I'm not going to do anything.
807960	810280	And then I find out everyone's doing anything.
810280	814520	You know, these days I'm so popular that I'm like, oh, no one invited me to anything.
814520	818960	And then it's like twelve thirty and I see there's like five Facebook invitations I just
818960	819960	never saw.
819960	822040	And I was like, oh, I guess I was invited.
822040	823280	This is a completely.
823280	828720	It feels exactly the same as not having been invited.
828720	831920	So I guess it's not my fault.
831920	835520	If you had seen the invitations like six days ago, would you have tried to?
835520	838160	I would have been like, oh, great, this is awesome.
838160	841440	And then I would have been in the exact same position at twelve thirty p.m.
841440	849680	And they just slide right off like a duck's fat.
849680	852240	You know, what is the duck's fat sliding off of ducks?
852240	853240	Yeah.
853240	856840	You know, when you're searing fat, you're searing duck meat in the pan and the fat just
856840	859920	slides right off of the of the pan.
859920	862240	No, off of the duck.
862240	864560	Who is a duck in this metaphor?
864560	871840	Well, I mean, I guess I would be the duck and then the fat would know my memory would
871840	879760	be the duck and then the fat would be the invitations sliding out of my memory and into
879760	882840	the pan of regret.
882840	883840	Disappointment.
883840	884840	Yeah.
884840	888160	So the flame is Halloween.
888160	893040	Well, I think I think the flame is the warmth of other people.
893040	899840	And you know, but it's that they're only they're only on because that's sentimental
899840	900840	sounding.
900840	901840	It still doesn't scan.
901840	903520	Well, no, yeah, no.
903520	908480	The warmth of other people is a catalyst that renders his fat.
908480	910160	Yeah.
910160	919520	But I'm always wearing the I'm always wearing the oven mitt of detachment and fear.
919520	923560	This is kind of you have you have to get one of those.
923560	933760	It's the it's it's a giant over the range vent of child abuse.
933760	935360	The fume hood of abuse.
935360	944520	Yeah, it sucks everything right out of the house, including the vapors of parental mistrust
944520	945520	or everything.
945520	948640	It says nothing's ever happening in your kitchen.
948640	956280	It's just like, ah, trust no one.
956280	957600	And you'll never get hurt.
957600	959680	What was like, if you had a spatula, what would that be?
959680	964400	And can we be this spatula of rearranged priorities?
964400	966120	All right.
966120	967320	One bit.
967320	968320	One bit.
968320	969320	All right.
969320	973080	I was high with Dino and we came up with a bit.
973080	975040	These are always good.
975080	977800	I think I can't remember how it came about.
977800	980520	It shouldn't be important, right?
980520	984300	Small talk pizza is an idea for a pizza place.
984300	986720	It's called small talk pizza.
986720	992720	But it's after the apocalypse, like there's these places like the only you know, like
992720	998080	you ever see like or read or see a boy and his dog, that kind of post apocalypse, where
998080	1001080	it's just like everything's just a wasteland.
1001080	1004120	And all anybody wants to do is create like a semblance of the old world.
1004120	1008160	But they just have like tents where they're showing like porn movies for a piece of aluminum
1008160	1013560	and like, like, like everything's just sad and everyone's sterile and just like dying
1013560	1014560	of cancer.
1014560	1020400	So like, like in, in, in that world, in that post-apocalyptic wasteland, I think like there
1020400	1024120	is a chance, like there could be one franchise that would be popular with everybody.
1024120	1027120	It would be called small talk pizza.
1027120	1028120	Everyone would respect it.
1028120	1032120	It would be like a place where you, you put all your guns down when you go in.
1032120	1036160	I'm like, well, while you're in there, you can't acknowledge that the apocalypse happened.
1036160	1043320	You can't, you can't acknowledge that the stakes have ever been higher than the weather
1043320	1048160	or like, oh, I'm in touch with the wife, you know, and it's just, that's what, that's what's
1048160	1049160	for sale.
1049160	1053120	The pizza's got like maggots on it, but it's just like, it's like, it's called small talk
1053120	1054120	pizza.
1054120	1057160	And it's like, like people are like, man, I can't wait to get to this.
1057160	1059800	They're like oasis is in, in the post apocalypse.
1060800	1061800	I want to get to the next small talk pizza.
1061800	1065800	And then people, everyone just wrote role plays, pretending that there's a different,
1065800	1067800	different world outside the pizza place.
1067800	1070800	And then they, and then eventually they can't, they can't, they don't have any more aluminum
1070800	1071800	to pay.
1071800	1075800	And then they get kicked out and they get shot, but, and they get turned into more pizza
1075800	1079800	probably in the, in the maggot farms.
1079800	1083800	I learned that from that Mad Max game, maggot farms.
1083800	1084800	All right.
1084800	1086800	I don't want to work on maggot farms anymore.
1086800	1087800	All right.
1087800	1088800	One more thing.
1089800	1090800	What?
1090800	1091800	Wait, I didn't get that.
1091800	1092800	It's a really awesome reference.
1092800	1094800	It's way, way above you, man.
1094800	1095800	Okay.
1095800	1096800	Good.
1096800	1097800	You, you heard those applause.
1097800	1098800	Those were smart people.
1098800	1105800	It did seem like an NPR level of funny bone.
1105800	1109800	Very sophisticated, vigorous clap from eight people.
1109800	1110800	Yes.
1110800	1114800	No, he did paint starry night.
1114800	1121800	This is just making fun of somebody, but it's a beloved somebody.
1121800	1127800	Like I was, I was with Dino, I was hanging out with my ex-girlfriend IO, who some people
1127800	1133800	like, like, like, like, like will know, like she's like kind of the basis for Brita from
1133800	1134800	community.
1134800	1137800	And the, like the aspects of her that sort of like, she speaks in Yogi Berraism.
1137800	1140800	She's like, she gets a lot of shit wrong.
1141800	1145800	But it ends up making a weird kind of logical sense in a very wrong way.
1145800	1146800	Politically Brita is just me.
1146800	1148800	Like, she just wants all the rich people to burn.
1148800	1152800	Like, for instance, a long time ago, she's in a band and she said, hey, guys, my band's
1152800	1153800	playing tomorrow night.
1153800	1154800	You should all come.
1154800	1155800	And I said, what time do you go on?
1155800	1158800	She goes, between 7.30 and 9 o'clock sharp.
1160800	1161800	Yeah.
1161800	1164800	And then sometimes she'll say stuff that like actually, actually, like actually kind of
1164800	1166800	trumps the, the idiom.
1166800	1168800	Like she, she was talking about somebody that lost their enthusiasm.
1168800	1172800	He was like, man, he's been through all these experiences and he almost got this.
1172800	1174800	And then it, and then it got taken away from him.
1174800	1176800	It just took the sails right off his boat.
1177800	1178800	Like, actually, that's better.
1178800	1179800	Yeah.
1180800	1182800	That's, that's worse than the wind out of your sails.
1182800	1183800	That's trivializing.
1183800	1185800	Wind changes.
1185800	1186800	The wind might come back.
1186800	1187800	You got no sails.
1187800	1188800	You're fucking doomed.
1188800	1191800	Her father was like, like, like her parents are separated.
1191800	1194800	Her father was like on a string of, you know, he's kind of a senior citizen.
1194800	1197800	And he's like, oh, he's just dating this girl and he's dating that girl.
1197800	1198800	I mean, he's a real donkey.
1198800	1199800	Hotei.
1201800	1202800	She, she met Don Juan.
1202800	1203800	Yeah.
1203800	1207800	So like, so a couple of nights, whenever we were hanging out, like, like I had to write
1207800	1210800	it down because we find out because we were talking about her grandma and I was like,
1210800	1214800	when I was, when I was dating her years and years and years ago, I was like, oh, I remember
1214800	1215800	your grandma.
1215800	1219800	We picked her up from the airport and we, you know, she, she was already starting to
1219800	1220800	succumb to dementia.
1220800	1221800	So she grabbed someone else's suitcase.
1221800	1224800	We didn't know that until I would like clip the lock on it and like pulled it open.
1224800	1228800	There's a black family scuba diving in a photo and it was like, we're going to go
1228800	1229800	back to LAX.
1229800	1233800	The, we were just talking about that story and it was funny and, and, and, and like,
1233800	1235800	she's like, that grandma has passed.
1235800	1241800	And, and, and then I, I, oh, who loved her grandma very much was like, she's like, you
1241800	1245800	know, she's gone now that she, and I was like, yeah, she lived, she lived for a long time.
1245800	1246800	Mission accomplished.
1246800	1248800	She's like, yeah, yeah.
1248800	1252800	But still, I mean, yeah, good riddance, grandma.
1255800	1258800	And we were like, wait, what?
1259800	1260800	This is like, why?
1261800	1262800	I love my grandma.
1262800	1264800	I don't think we should joke around about her.
1264800	1265800	I was like, you what?
1265800	1266800	No.
1266800	1267800	What did you say?
1268800	1269800	You said good riddance grandma.
1269800	1270800	She said, yeah, I loved her.
1270800	1274800	Like, like, like, like, it's like, I hope she has a good, good time.
1274800	1277800	And like, wherever she is, it's a bad boobies.
1277800	1278800	Good riddance.
1279800	1281800	That's not what that means.
1281800	1282800	She thought it was like good riddance.
1282800	1286800	It's like good riddance is like for my homies, you know, like good, good riddance.
1286800	1293800	Like, like, like you've been, you've been rid of existence and good on you.
1293800	1296800	It's funny because it's like, it's like, yeah, well, why don't, you know, why, why wouldn't
1296800	1297800	good riddance mean that?
1297800	1298800	I mean, it doesn't, it's arbitrary.
1298800	1301800	It's just funny that it was like, how did she avoid that?
1304800	1305800	All right.
1305800	1306800	All right.
1306800	1307800	Yeah.
1307800	1308800	My chiropractor fucked up my back.
1308800	1311800	I couldn't go to the Minecraft creators, a Halloween party.
1311800	1312800	You know what?
1312800	1321800	Uh, I got it pretty bad, but, uh, do you know anything about the Minecraft creators Halloween
1321800	1322800	party?
1322800	1323800	I know.
1323800	1331800	I mean, dude, that guy, he created Minecraft, which I've been playing for my whole life.
1331800	1333800	And he lives in LA now.
1333800	1337800	And he like, what he bought, I don't know how much I don't want to scare him off if
1337800	1338800	he likes his privacy or whatever.
1338800	1339800	I talked to him on Twitter.
1339800	1344800	So I don't want to, I don't want to fuck up the friendship, but I think it's a matter
1344800	1350800	of public record that like, when he moved to LA, he fucking like outbid Jay Z on a house.
1350800	1355800	It was like, and, and, and like, you can look up the house and there's a YouTube video.
1355800	1361800	It's like, like, like when, when houses get to a certain level, there's like a video for
1361800	1362800	the house.
1362800	1368800	That's like, like Christopher Nolan shot it, but like, like, like, like I got crew and
1369800	1372800	it's like, and it's, and no shame because it's like, oh, you're paying this much money
1372800	1373800	for a house.
1373800	1374800	The reason you're going to do it.
1374800	1379800	It's like, you click on this YouTube video and it's like, like, like, like a sports car
1379800	1386800	pulls up and two women who are clearly professional escorts get out of the car like a Lamborghini
1386800	1389800	and they just walk into the house, but they don't live there.
1389800	1392800	They clearly do not live there.
1392800	1394800	And so the insinuations are already crazy.
1394800	1395800	It looks like that.
1395800	1396800	They're just like, oh, here we are.
1396800	1397800	Like that's always like, yeah, yeah.
1397800	1402800	I mean, we're not saying these women come with the house, but let's face it.
1402800	1406800	This house will bring these women to your door and a Lamborghini.
1406800	1413800	They'll just be, they'll, their ways will tell them like, uh, is this guy kind of like,
1413800	1414800	is he kind of dashing figure?
1414800	1415800	Like, what is it?
1415800	1416800	No, no, no.
1416800	1419800	He's now he's, he's a nerd, you know, but, but he's a, a bazillionaire.
1419800	1422800	And so, and, and, and, but the house is just insane.
1422800	1425800	Is this money all just that one game or is he, is he of a budget?
1425800	1426800	Yeah, basically.
1426800	1431960	I mean, it's like he, he sold because he created a game and like sold a subscription
1431960	1437440	to it, dealt honestly with the marketplace and said, all you have to do ever once in
1437440	1441800	your life, like I've put a total of $20 into Minecraft or whatever it is.
1441800	1446800	Cause I got an, you get an account and that licenses you to keep playing the game as it
1446800	1447800	develops.
1447800	1451800	Now it's done developing, but my, I still get to play the game and everyone gets to
1451800	1455000	mod it, you know, whatever I'll do it on a different podcast.
1455000	1457000	He sold the game to Microsoft.
1457000	1458000	Right.
1458000	1459000	The game is now bought by Microsoft.
1459000	1461920	The fucking, they're making a movie at Warner Brothers.
1461920	1462920	It's like, he kidding.
1462920	1467760	He himself can't even keep track of like, of what's going, I, I like, I tweeted him
1467760	1469880	after I came out of a like Warner Brothers meeting.
1469880	1472920	I was like, man, do you know who's making this movie and what they're talking about?
1472920	1473920	He's like, Nope, I don't know.
1473920	1474920	And fuck you.
1474920	1482320	I just, I'm just, I've got to go Jay-Z's trying to get onto the compound.
1482320	1487720	He's stacking a thousand dollar bills and trying to get Beyonce to like lift him over
1487720	1492440	the gate because he wants to kiss my garage, but I won't let him.
1492440	1495000	I would just, I would just sneak in the back of one of those Lamborghinis.
1495000	1496720	Those girls are driving.
1496720	1503680	Um, yeah, you could definitely like easily fit an adult male in one of their cleavages.
1503680	1509360	You could have just like kangarooed in there, taken a bottle of wine and bought a normal
1509360	1511320	sized house downhill.
1511320	1515120	Uh, anyways, let's bring out our guests.
1515120	1518920	My God, what an important guest we have tonight.
1518920	1525680	Um, I would, is national treasure too high flown to describe our next guest?
1525680	1526680	Yeah.
1526680	1532120	But I still feel like, you know, we're entertainers.
1532120	1536240	We work in the entertainment industry, whether we like it or not, Dan and Spencer.
1536240	1540360	And I think there's a rule of entertainment that says, give the people what they want.
1540360	1541360	Yes.
1541360	1542360	Yes.
1542360	1547440	No, whether they think they deserve it or not, whether they actually want it or not.
1547440	1552120	No, they, most people want it and you know, and I, I, I, I've been honest about the fact
1552120	1557720	that I don't, I don't, I don't like this person and I've, I've, I've known him long enough
1557720	1563720	to make that decision, you know, and, and, and, uh, um, I, and there's a piece to that,
1563720	1566000	you know, like I don't like you.
1566760	1572280	You're a bad person, uh, you're immature and you're, and you're selfish.
1572280	1577400	And then, but then he says, you know, that's you.
1577400	1587280	But let's just talk to him about, William H. Macy, uh, please welcome, uh, director, writer,
1587280	1593840	artist, clothes horse, uh, Holocaust denier, Rob Strav.
1596000	1609200	Oh, the camera, the camera likes it.
1609200	1610200	The camera likes it.
1610200	1613040	If you sit there, what's that?
1613040	1614040	The camera likes it.
1614040	1621600	If you sit there, it's a better stage picture.
1622600	1625600	How you doing, Dan?
1625600	1626600	Yo.
1626600	1627600	Hey everybody.
1627600	1628600	I'm back.
1628600	1634600	I don't get excited.
1634600	1635600	I was away for a while.
1635600	1637600	And I don't always listen to the episodes.
1637600	1639600	I snuck in while you were gone.
1639600	1642600	And I got to say, I listened to that one because there was such a media sensation.
1642600	1643600	Oh God.
1643600	1645600	And it was really, it was really good.
1645600	1646600	I loved it.
1646600	1647600	Oh, okay.
1647600	1648600	All right.
1648600	1650600	You and Spencer have a, like they should have a spin off.
1650600	1651600	Oh man.
1651600	1652600	Okay.
1652600	1653600	Make it happen.
1653600	1654600	Make it happen.
1654600	1656600	So what's going on on the Lego movie?
1656600	1658600	What are the top secret?
1658600	1661600	Can't end a movie with Will Ferrell coming downstairs and going, they're all Legos.
1661600	1663600	What are you, what the fuck are you going to do?
1663600	1668600	Well, well, the whole, the sequel all takes place in reality.
1668600	1675600	Uh, we, uh, we have Will Ferrell is just like, you know, someone let's, let's get to know
1675600	1676600	each other.
1676600	1678600	You know, it's just seeing like you play with this stuff.
1678600	1680600	It's like, why are we in this basement here?
1680600	1683600	Let's, let's go on a trip and they get in the car and they're driving, driving, driving,
1683600	1686600	driving, driving flat tire.
1686600	1692600	It's like, uh, 12 minutes in and then, uh, they, they, they walk into, they go, well,
1692600	1694600	maybe there's more tires over here.
1694600	1699600	This, this, this is actual dialogue that we're working with.
1699600	1704600	And these are people that already have a, uh, we all know they love Legos or the, or
1704600	1707600	they're actually not called Legos.
1707600	1708600	No, no.
1708600	1709600	Ever.
1709600	1715600	You know, Lego is, is it, cause I got corrected and I'm trying to remind myself not to say
1715600	1716600	it.
1716600	1717600	You're shaking your head.
1717600	1718600	He's, he's nodding.
1718600	1719600	Okay.
1719600	1720600	Okay.
1720600	1724600	Well, can you explain, can you explain to the, no, they're Lego bricks.
1724600	1725600	Right.
1725600	1726600	Right.
1726600	1731600	Jesus knows cause he works at space X and a lot of Musk doesn't like acknowledge that
1731600	1733600	the ships are made of Legos.
1733600	1734600	Right.
1734600	1735600	Lego.
1736600	1737600	There's a hard pass rule there.
1737600	1738600	You tell these people, these are spaceships.
1738600	1742600	You do not say they're going to go into the forest to find another.
1742600	1743600	You don't say Legos.
1743600	1744600	They're totally.
1744600	1745600	It's just a Lego.
1745600	1746600	It's just like a Lego guy.
1746600	1747600	Yeah.
1747600	1748600	Right.
1748600	1749600	Not a Lego.
1749600	1750600	We don't play Legos.
1750600	1751600	We play with Lego.
1751600	1752600	Right.
1752600	1753600	You play with Lego bricks.
1753600	1756600	That's something that they get really like, cause when I was like pitching myself as the
1756600	1764600	director, I was like, you know, I played Legos my whole life and they're like,
1765600	1769600	and like Phil and Chris are like going, don't, don't, don't hate that.
1769600	1770600	Legos come.
1770600	1772600	That's like, did they come from Scandinavia?
1772600	1773600	Yeah.
1773600	1774600	Legos.
1774600	1777600	Did they come from like an European country where who makes Lego?
1777600	1778600	Uh, they're Danish.
1778600	1779600	Danish.
1779600	1780600	Yeah.
1780600	1784600	So are all the people in the room like Danish people are like, they're all like, whoop,
1784600	1785600	whoop, whoop.
1785600	1786600	Yeah.
1786600	1787600	No, no, no, no.
1787600	1790600	Well, no, no, there's, there's, there's people from Lego that work.
1790600	1793600	I like what a fanciful idea you have about the Danish.
1794600	1795600	So fancy.
1795600	1796600	Yeah.
1796600	1797600	They got big gloves.
1797600	1798600	Oh.

1799600	1802600	You're eating croissants.
1802600	1803600	Yes.
1803600	1805600	Our croissants are crazy.
1805600	1806600	Croissants.
1806600	1807600	Is it true?
1807600	1808600	What about this photo?
1808600	1810600	Everyone keeps talking about, about.
1810600	1811600	The Loch Ness Monster.
1811600	1812600	No.
1812600	1814600	Well, let me guess.
1814600	1815600	Let me guess.
1815600	1818600	The guy that invented Legos.
1818600	1819600	Hamilton.
1819600	1820600	Hamilton.
1820600	1821600	Hamilton.
1821600	1822600	The guy that goes.
1822600	1824600	Shaking hands with Hitler and they're smiling and they're.
1824600	1826600	You're making this up.
1826600	1827600	Okay.
1827600	1828600	So page.
1828600	1829600	He's trying to.
1829600	1830600	Well, that's why I asked.
1830600	1831600	He's trying to ruin my career.
1831600	1832600	That's why I asked.
1832600	1833600	He's still.
1833600	1834600	I didn't know.
1834600	1835600	I'm not a scientist.
1835600	1836600	I hear rumors and then I just.
1836600	1837600	Yeah, yeah.
1837600	1838600	Retweet them.
1838600	1839600	Okay.
1839600	1840600	Okay.
1840600	1841600	So page 12, they're looking for.
1841600	1842600	They're looking for tires.
1842600	1843600	They're looking for more tires.
1843600	1844600	And then we, we dissolve.
1844600	1845600	It's a time thing.
1845600	1846600	And Will Ferros.
1846600	1849840	I got his, his shirt's been torn and he's got his tie wrapped around his head to collect
1849840	1852320	sweat and he's chopping through the underbrush.
1852320	1854200	The underbrush is all everywhere.
1854200	1855200	There's underbrush.
1855200	1856200	At the tire place?
1856200	1857200	Here.
1857200	1858200	No, they haven't found the tire place.
1858200	1859200	Oh.
1859200	1860200	That's what they're doing.
1860200	1861200	Okay.
1861200	1862200	They're looking for.
1862200	1863200	They got the chop through the underbrush.
1863200	1864200	You know this.
1864200	1865200	This is, you know, part of the story structure.
1865200	1866200	Underbrush.
1866200	1867200	Underbrush.
1867200	1870280	And then he turns around and he's like, hey, hey, I found, I found some tires.
1870280	1871280	He turns around.
1871280	1872280	The boy's gone.
1872280	1873600	The boy is gone.
1873600	1874600	The boy is gone.
1874600	1875600	Oh, the boy.
1875600	1876600	The Lego boy.
1876600	1877600	He got tired of that.
1877600	1878600	He went back to the car.
1878600	1879600	Was it just him or the boy?
1880360	1882480	Was there more people in their party or was it just him or the boy?
1882480	1883480	Have you seen the movie?
1883480	1884480	No.
1884480	1885480	Oh my God.
1885480	1886480	No.
1886480	1887480	No.
1887480	1888480	This is a movie that hasn't been made yet.
1888480	1889480	No.
1889480	1890480	The first movie.
1890480	1891480	No.
1891480	1892480	Okay.
1892480	1893480	So it's just him or the boy.
1893480	1894480	In the first movie?
1894480	1895480	At the end of the first movie, it's just him or the boy?
1895480	1896480	Yes.
1896480	1897480	There's him or the boy.
1897480	1898480	Okay.
1898480	1899480	Are those the only two characters that get into the car?
1899480	1900480	Yeah.
1900480	1901480	Okay.
1901480	1902480	Yeah.
1902480	1903480	Well, that's the only one we care about, right?
1903480	1904480	Right?
1904480	1905480	Okay.
1905480	1906480	You don't want to violate Kennedy.
1906480	1907480	Okay.
1907480	1908480	Okay.
1908480	1909480	And he's like, chop it through the underbrush.
1909480	1910480	We got that.
1910480	1913080	And he's got the tire, you know, and he's got, you know, he's got his, he's got his
1913080	1915040	shirt wrapped around his pants and girls.
1915040	1916040	It's so sexy.
1916040	1917040	It's so great.
1917040	1922120	And he's like, chop it through the underbrush, upper brush, and he goes, hey, I found the
1922120	1923120	tires.
1923120	1925240	And he turns around, the boy's gone.
1925240	1926800	The boy's gone.
1926800	1927800	The boy got sick of doing it.
1927800	1928800	He's waiting back in the car.
1928800	1929800	Okay.
1929800	1930800	And, uh.
1930800	1931800	Do we know that we cut back to the boy in the car?
1931800	1932800	Yeah.
1932800	1933800	We do, we do a hard cut.
1933800	1934800	Okay.
1934800	1935800	Do a hard cut.
1935800	1936800	Oh.
1936800	1937800	He goes, he goes, no dissolves or anything like that.
1937800	1938800	There's no wipes or anything.
1938800	1939800	It's just a hard cut.
1939800	1940800	This is page 25.
1940800	1941800	Here's a hard cut.
1941800	1942800	It's like a bad, 25, 20 seconds.
1942800	1943800	Yeah.
1943800	1944800	25.
1944800	1945800	Oh, okay.
1945800	1946800	So this is the crossing of the threshold.
1946800	1947800	Yeah.
1947800	1948800	Yeah.
1948800	1949800	Yeah.
1949800	1950800	Yeah.
1950800	1954800	Anyway, the kid's screwing around, you know, he's like, you know, humming a tune like it
1954800	1955800	should do.
1955800	1956800	Sounds kind of Danish.
1956800	1957800	Well, it's not Danish.
1957800	1958800	It's set in America.
1958800	1959800	It's set in 2007.
1959800	1960800	And so, that'll come back.
1960800	1961800	That'll come back.
1962800	1963800	And he's kicking his leg like I do.
1963800	1964800	We did that in Milwaukee a couple of times.
1964800	1965800	Hits, hits the, hits the, hits the brake of the car.
1965800	1966800	Okay.
1966800	1967800	Oh.
1967800	1968800	So now it's extra stop.
1968800	1969800	Yeah.
1969800	1970800	Yeah.
1970800	1971800	No, no, no.
1971800	1972800	You think that.
1972800	1973800	You think that.
1973800	1974800	But then it comes back.
1974800	1975800	Okay.
1975800	1976800	Okay.
1976800	1977800	Okay.
1977800	1978800	Okay.
1978800	1979800	Okay.
1979800	1980800	Okay.
1980800	1981800	Okay.
1981800	1982800	Okay.
1982800	1983800	Okay.
1983800	1984800	Okay.
1984800	1985800	Okay.
1985800	1986800	Okay.
1986800	1987800	Okay.
1987800	1988800	Okay.
1988800	1989800	Okay.
1990800	1991800	Okay.
1991800	1992800	Okay.
1992800	1993800	Okay.
1993800	1994800	Okay.
1994800	1995500	Okay.
1998300	2000800	So there's another example right now is, and then it's coming back to the speed
2000800	2001800	of the truck.
2001800	2002800	Caused.
2002800	2003800	And then it comes back.
2003800	2004800	And then it's coming back to the speed of the truck.
2004800	2005800	And then it's coming back to the speed of the truck.
2005800	2006800	So there's one here.
2006800	2007800	Pulling down the hill, it's coming back and it's coming back.
2007800	2008800	So there's one here.
2008800	2010140	And then it's coming back to it and it's coming back to the speed of the
2010140	2011140	truck.
2011140	2012140	And then it's coming back to the speed of the truck.
2012140	2013140	So there's one here.
2013140	2014140	And then it's coming back to the speed of the truck.
2014140	2015140	And then it comes back.
2015140	2016140	So there's one here.
2016140	2017140	And then it's coming back to the speed of the truck.
2017140	2018140	It's coming back to the speed of the truck.
2018140	2019140	There's one down the hill.
2019140	2020140	What's that?
2020140	2021140	Does that flat tire?
2021140	2022140	No, no, no.
2022140	2023460	You should see the shape of this hill.
2023460	2024460	Okay.
2024460	2025460	Yeah.
2025460	2026620	That would be cool though.
2026620	2032180	If the car had both, all four tires working, it would have clearly
2032180	2033840	just rolled into a nice soft embankment.
2033840	2034840	Yeah.
2034840	2037480	But the one popped tire would make you get a dark, scary patent.
2037480	2038480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2038480	2039480	Yeah, yeah.
2039480	2040480	Yeah.
2040480	2041480	Because it's doing like that.
2041480	2042480	It's fishtailing.
2042480	2043480	No, it was.
2043480	2044480	It's already in the script.
2045480	2048480	I feel like he just stole it.
2048480	2049480	All right.
2049480	2051480	Well, you can check the date on the document.
2051480	2056480	So that's all I'm going to give you, but I think we already know.
2056480	2057480	All right.
2057480	2058480	LEGO 2.
2058480	2060480	Thanks for the scoop.
2060480	2068480	No, actually, for real, for real, I'm talking to the BBC on Thursday.
2068480	2070480	About what?
2070480	2072480	Oh, I don't know.
2072480	2073480	Wait, what do you mean?
2074480	2077480	There's a certain character that the BBC owns.
2077480	2078480	Oh.
2078480	2080480	And they're asking me, would it be possible?
2080480	2081480	Doctor Who?
2081480	2082480	Mmm.
2083480	2087480	You only do fancy eyebrow lifting if there's a Doctor Who character.
2087480	2090480	I don't know what you're talking about.
2090480	2093480	That's a crazy leak that you just leaked.
2093480	2095480	I don't know what you're talking about.
2095480	2098480	He just told us the first 26 pages of the movie.
2098480	2099480	Yeah.
2099480	2102480	Do you know how sued I'm going to get?
2103480	2104480	All right.
2104480	2106480	I'm going to get so sued, man, but I can afford it.
2106480	2108480	Fucking money.
2110480	2112480	Money's like shit to me.
2112480	2114480	I just throw it out the window.
2116480	2117480	Like shit.
2117480	2122480	Right before he had any money, he used to just throw shit out the window all the time.
2122480	2126480	Yeah, I don't give a fuck about crime.
2127480	2128480	Sanitation?
2128480	2129480	Yeah.
2129480	2130480	Just throwing...
2130480	2131480	What's this?
2131480	2132480	Poop of people.
2134480	2137480	But now you can afford to not get poop all over the house.
2137480	2138480	Yeah, man.
2138480	2139480	You can just throw money at people.
2139480	2141480	People pay me not to do that.
2143480	2144480	That's a good racket.
2144480	2145480	Yeah.
2145480	2146480	That's a good racket.
2146480	2151480	Do something obnoxious until they go, listen, here's five bucks.
2151480	2154480	Will you please stop throwing shit out the window?
2154480	2155480	Yeah.
2155480	2156480	I'm mowing the lawn here.
2156480	2159480	We could arrest you, but that kind of lawyer is getting involved.
2159480	2164480	People are doing hopscotch, and there's shit all over my lawn.
2164480	2166480	You remember that show, Real People?
2166480	2167480	Yeah, with...
2167480	2168480	Skip Stevenson, Sarah Purcell.
2168480	2169480	Rick O'Kasik.
2169480	2170480	Fran Tarkington.
2170480	2171480	Fran Tarkington.
2171480	2172480	Lane Campbell.
2172480	2173480	So like...
2173480	2174480	Gordon Whitefoot.
2174480	2177480	Like the crack of the 80s.
2177480	2178480	Fred Willard was in it.
2178480	2180480	That was the first time I saw Fred Willard.
2180480	2181480	That's true, yeah.
2181480	2184480	They would do just a little...
2185480	2188480	They would do like little human interest pieces like,
2188480	2192480	this guy's lost his leg, but now he's got a plastic leg, and he can still jump around.
2192480	2196480	Or this guy's so Chinese fish love him, and...
2197480	2198480	Classic Real People.
2198480	2200480	It sounds racist, but that was the story.
2200480	2202480	Am I combining Fran Tarkington...
2202480	2204480	Who isn't that incredible, and who isn't Real People?
2204480	2206480	Fran Tarkington wasn't that incredible.
2206480	2211480	Jim Davis, the creator of Garfield, and...
2211480	2213480	That's incredible, had the severe edge.
2213480	2217480	This guy's gonna lock himself in a cabinet with a Rubik's Cube, and he might suffocate.
2217480	2218480	That's incredible.
2218480	2220480	And then Real People was like, Real People!
2220480	2222480	This guy's got a flag for underwear!
2222480	2223480	That's what it was.
2223480	2225480	So one of the guys on Real People was...
2225480	2226480	He lived in a lighthouse.
2226480	2227480	Skip Stevenson.
2227480	2230480	No, that was one of the hosts of the show.
2231480	2232480	He didn't live in a...
2232480	2233480	I was agreeing with you.
2233480	2235480	One of the people that they...
2235480	2237480	The real people that they did the show about...
2237480	2240480	A guy lived in a lighthouse, and then...
2240480	2243480	And then there was a whole segment I just remember of like...
2243480	2246480	They talked about like, but where do you go to the bathroom?
2246480	2248480	You live all the way up on this lighthouse.
2248480	2249480	Do you have to run down every time?
2249480	2252480	And he goes like, well, we have a system for that.
2252480	2257480	And then they showed this montage of bags full of pee sliding down a fishing line...
2257480	2261480	From a top window and exploding against a tree trunk.
2261480	2265480	And just like, piss hitting the camera, and like...
2265480	2267480	I was like, what?
2267480	2269480	They put the camera close enough to...
2269480	2271480	First of all, why is this broadcast television?
2271480	2275480	Because this is happening all over the place, and no one's celebrating it.
2276480	2278480	Second of all...
2278480	2281480	How do I join the lighthouse union?
2281480	2283480	Where do I sign up?
2283480	2286480	Second of all, drop it out the window.
2286480	2288480	Too, too gross to...
2288480	2291480	You want it to get out there before it explodes?
2291480	2295480	You know, we had this discussion about our dogs, our pets.
2295480	2298480	You gotta get that stuff far away from where you live.
2298480	2301480	If you just drop it, you're gonna be walking in that stuff.
2301480	2303480	But if you throw it on the tree...
2304480	2307480	It's not next to your car or the mailbox.
2307480	2310480	So this is one tree that just soaked in pee and poo?
2310480	2313480	It grows like a motherfucker, though.
2314480	2317480	The limbs are all long and stuff.
2317480	2321480	The other trees are all jealous going, I want some pee, too.
2323480	2325480	I'm not getting no pee.
2325480	2327480	How come he got all the pee?
2327480	2329480	I got no pee.
2329480	2330480	What did he do?
2330480	2332480	The leafy tree gets the pee.
2334480	2336480	Are you wearing pants?
2336480	2338480	Are you wearing pants, sir?
2338480	2340480	It's a fair question.
2340480	2341480	You're a duffel bag.
2341480	2343480	Oh, for Halloween? November 1st?
2343480	2345480	That was yesterday.
2345480	2346480	That was yesterday.
2346480	2347480	Can we get him a present?
2347480	2349480	He looks naked, but he's wearing a duffel bag.
2349480	2351480	He was dressed like this last week.
2351480	2353480	Now show us your dick.
2355480	2356480	Take it out.
2356480	2357480	What?
2357480	2358480	I am wearing underwear.
2358480	2359480	Take it off?
2359480	2360480	That's an awesome costume.
2360480	2361480	It's inexpensive.
2361480	2362480	Also loaded with pockets.
2362480	2363480	You can carry your wallet in there.
2363480	2364480	You got a phone.
2364480	2366480	You can carry your keys.
2366480	2369480	You can put your bag of pee in there.
2369480	2370480	You can do everything.
2370480	2371480	You can put a...
2371480	2372480	Were you...
2372480	2373480	Did you think everybody...
2373480	2375480	This is the closest to the Harmontown Halloween show,
2375480	2376480	so you thought...
2376480	2377480	Right.
2377480	2378480	You're going to be cool.
2378480	2379480	You're probably too young.
2379480	2380480	Do you have children by any chance?
2380480	2381480	You're too young.
2381480	2384480	If you had a little baby, you'd make them like a fanny pack.
2385480	2386480	Stand up again.
2386480	2390480	You get kind of like a Will Forte Last Man thing going on here,
2390480	2392480	which is kind of awesome.
2394480	2397480	How willing are you to just sit up here for the rest of the show?
2397480	2398480	Okay.
2398480	2399480	There you go.
2399480	2403480	Sit as close as possible to Dan because of the stage picture.
2403480	2404480	Will you slide one over?
2404480	2405480	Because I have a new friend coming up,
2405480	2407480	but I guess that'll be my second.
2407480	2408480	What is your name, duffel bag man?
2408480	2409480	Doug.
2409480	2410480	Doug the duffel bag.
2413480	2415480	Your name is like the shortened version of duffel bag.
2415480	2421480	Does Doug the duffel bag have an interesting voice?
2423480	2424480	You have a character?
2424480	2428480	What's your mild-mannered work-a-day job?
2428480	2430480	What do you do when you're not a duffel bag?
2430480	2433480	I do freelance PA work and some acting takes and stuff.
2433480	2434480	Is this the character?
2434480	2436480	No, no, no, no.
2436480	2439480	When you get into costume, when you take scissors
2439480	2441480	and cut holes in a duffel bag and put it on,
2441480	2443480	say, honey, I'm leaving the house.
2444480	2445480	All day's work.
2445480	2447480	I just don't want to be access baggage for anyone.
2447480	2449480	Oh, nice.
2449480	2450480	Okay, so he's got catchphrases.
2450480	2451480	Oh, man.
2451480	2452480	He's got catchphrases.
2452480	2453480	Stop it.
2453480	2454480	I got a lot more.
2454480	2455480	Please.
2455480	2456480	Let's hear some more, man.
2456480	2457480	Do five minutes.
2459480	2460480	Do your whole set.
2462480	2463480	For those who are just listening,
2463480	2465480	it does seem to me like you must have tried this
2465480	2466480	with like a bigger friend.
2466480	2468480	Like if Steve Agee was up here,
2468480	2471480	the temptation would be for him to put his arms through,
2471480	2474480	like and wear you like Chewbacca in Empire.
2475480	2476480	Like the straps are...
2476480	2477480	Do you think that would work?
2477480	2478480	Have you tried that?
2482480	2484480	There's nothing bad that's going to happen.
2490480	2491480	I'm flying.
2492480	2493480	I'm flying.
2496480	2497480	Teach him the force.
2498480	2499480	That's pretty good.
2500480	2501480	All right.
2501480	2502480	Jug the duffel bag.
2502480	2503480	That's actually...
2503480	2505480	This is actually a great costume,
2505480	2507480	because if you passed out and you...
2507480	2509480	Yeah, and you have a tall friend, you're fucking right.
2509480	2510480	It's just like, oh, shit.
2510480	2511480	Better take...
2511480	2513480	Better take Doug home.
2513480	2516480	Oh, that would be amazing to see how keep the tag on you
2516480	2518480	that has your address and your phone number.
2518480	2519480	Drop me off.
2519480	2522480	I think you can just drink it until you pass out anywhere
2522480	2525480	and the cops just like pick you up and put you on.
2526480	2528480	There should be a system of carousels.
2528480	2529480	Yeah, just...
2530480	2532480	Just don't go to the airport.
2532480	2534480	Go to the airport with baggage claims and just hang out.
2534480	2536480	This whole time we've been thinking the airport sucks
2536480	2538480	because it's so incompatible with real life,
2538480	2540480	we should be turning the whole city into the airport.
2541480	2543480	If it was all that way,
2543480	2545480	Wiz Khalifa could ride his hoverboard.
2545480	2547480	Like there wouldn't be any...
2547480	2551480	You have a TSA checkpoint outside your own front door.
2552480	2554480	If you're rich, you have the...
2554480	2557480	You go, hey, Charlie, and he's like, any weapons, Mr. Harmon?
2557480	2559480	Charlie, what do you think?
2559480	2561480	Go on through.
2561480	2564480	It would have been a 95% failure rate anyway.
2565480	2568480	And then you just step out and then you're in the concourse
2568480	2571480	of reality in which you are free to travel the world
2571480	2573480	and you are also a bag.
2573480	2575480	And so everywhere...
2575480	2578480	Anywhere you lay down, if you just stop moving,
2578480	2580480	you just start moving towards...
2580480	2582480	Like someone will pick you up
2582480	2585480	and some people could decide to take you home.
2586480	2588480	All right, I haven't thought it through, but...
2588480	2591480	Would airlines be able to fat sham you and pay extra
2591480	2593480	if you weigh a lot?
2593480	2595480	That's illegal.
2595480	2596480	That would be illegal.
2596480	2598480	They wouldn't be allowed to do that.
2598480	2600480	But think about the weight loss incentives.
2600480	2602480	People love money and they love being fat,
2602480	2604480	so put those two against each other.
2604480	2606480	They don't do that enough.
2607480	2609480	You just go, oh, you're fat, huh?
2609480	2611480	Must be nice.
2611480	2612480	What do you mean?
2612480	2614480	It costs a lot to be so fat.
2614480	2616480	Oh, yeah, it does.
2616480	2618480	I should be thinner.
2621480	2623480	So I can get those miles.
2623480	2625480	All right.
2626480	2629480	I actually did that on purpose because otherwise
2629480	2634480	I would have transitioned from high octane hilarity.
2634480	2636480	Are you saying that nobody...
2636480	2638480	I'm assuming you wore this last night in Halloween, right?
2638480	2641480	This guy looks a lot like Justin Roiland.
2641480	2643480	Let's get him up here, guys.
2643480	2645480	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2645480	2647480	That's a cavalcade of stars.
2647480	2650480	You kept giving him my periphery
2650480	2652480	and I kept thinking, Justin...
2652480	2654480	We have tall Roiland with us right now.
2654480	2655480	I love it.
2655480	2656480	Well, this is...
2656480	2657480	I mean, you own this.
2657480	2659480	You brought up a guy that looks like a guy.
2659480	2661480	So, Justin?
2662480	2663480	Yes?
2663480	2665480	My name's Garrett.
2665480	2667480	I do get the Justin Roiland thing a lot.
2667480	2668480	Yeah?
2668480	2670480	What do they say?
2672480	2675480	This is what my podcast would be like.
2675480	2678480	Oh, you look like somebody I know?
2678480	2679480	What do they say?
2679480	2680480	What do they say?
2680480	2681480	What my podcast is like.
2681480	2682480	Oh, okay.
2684480	2686480	What do they say?
2687480	2689480	What do they say to you?
2690480	2692480	They go, hey, man, Mr. Musics is a lot like...
2692480	2694480	Scud the disposable assassin.
2694480	2695480	What the fuck, man?
2695480	2697480	There was like a guy...
2697480	2698480	Where are you?
2698480	2699480	Are you in the crowd?
2699480	2700480	Somebody like came up to me and was like,
2700480	2701480	are you Justin?
2701480	2702480	I was like, what?
2702480	2703480	And then...
2703480	2706480	And then you went, why?
2706480	2707480	No, I just said no.
2707480	2708480	I just said, I just said no.
2708480	2710480	Why do you ask?
2710480	2711480	Try that.
2711480	2712480	Should I?
2712480	2713480	With him right now.
2714480	2716480	And we'll just watch.
2717480	2719480	Okay, I texted that photo to Justin.
2719480	2720480	Is that enough for this guy?
2720480	2721480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2721480	2722480	But we're done.
2722480	2723480	We're done.
2723480	2724480	Thank you.
2726480	2727480	So Doug...
2727480	2729480	But try the creepy, you know, back of the hand,
2729480	2730480	stroking the arm thing, you know,
2730480	2732480	and let us know how that works out.
2732480	2733480	Doug, the double bag.
2733480	2736480	So you wore this last night, or did you have another thing?
2736480	2737480	I did.
2737480	2739480	Did you get any pulses?
2741480	2743480	Rob, beat me to my follow-up question.
2743480	2744480	Sorry.
2745480	2747480	Did you get any pussy?
2747480	2748480	Did you get any pussy?
2749480	2752480	Are you saying that nobody tried to wear you as a backpack last night?
2752480	2753480	No one tried to wear me as a backpack.
2753480	2754480	That didn't happen?
2754480	2755480	I know.
2755480	2756480	Wow.
2756480	2757480	All right.
2757480	2759480	You're hanging around with the wrong people, Doug.
2759480	2761480	I'd like to bring a special friend up to the stage
2761480	2762480	that we've never met.
2762480	2765480	So, Jason Pollack, are you here?
2765480	2766480	I am.
2766480	2767480	Okay.
2767480	2768480	Are you...
2768480	2770480	Do you have cold feet, or are you willing to come up?
2770480	2771480	I have cold feet.
2771480	2773480	I just want to give you...
2773480	2774480	Were you willing to come up here?
2774480	2775480	I'd love you to.
2775480	2776480	He didn't ask to come up.
2776480	2777480	I'll tell you why I'm pulling him up.
2777480	2778480	Neither did I.
2781480	2783480	Come on up, Jason Pollack, and I'll explain.
2788480	2789480	Hello.
2789480	2790480	Me too.
2791480	2792480	Jason, this is Rob.
2792480	2793480	Yeah, sit there.
2794480	2797480	So you guys remember my neighbor, Beth Butzen, the eucalyptus tree lady.
2798480	2799480	The tumor lady.
2799480	2805480	Wonderful, wonderful ray of light in my life at this raw time.
2806480	2810480	She texted me today and said, there's this guy.
2812480	2814480	He's a friend of my neighbor's.
2814480	2816480	He didn't know they were my neighbor's.
2817480	2821480	He and his mom listened to the show all the time together.
2822480	2827480	And then he heard my neighbor, his friend, on the podcast.
2828480	2829480	Am I getting that right?
2829480	2830480	Is that about the size of it?
2830480	2831480	Kind of confused.
2831480	2832480	That's right, yeah.
2832480	2833480	Okay.
2833480	2834480	It is a little confusing.
2834480	2839480	But suffice it to say, you texted Beth and Dan at one point and said,
2839480	2843480	holy shit, I just heard you on my favorite podcast that I listened to with my mom.
2843480	2844480	So the thing is...
2844480	2845480	What is that podcast?
2846480	2847480	Harvard Town.
2847480	2848480	Don't.
2848480	2849480	Don't shrob.
2850480	2851480	Could be Daily Grant.
2851480	2853480	You guys just saw live shrobbing.
2854480	2856480	So Beth texted me.
2856480	2860480	This wasn't Jason's idea, but Beth texted me and said, like,
2860480	2864480	the thing is that Jason's mom is very sick right now.
2864480	2865480	And they used to...
2865480	2867480	They listen to the podcast every week together.
2867480	2869480	So she's very likely listening now.
2869480	2870480	And...
2870480	2872480	Or, you know, now being whenever she listens to it.
2872480	2874480	I'm not going to assume she subscribes.
2875480	2877480	But that you guys...
2877480	2879480	Only five dollars, lady.
2880480	2881480	Yeah.
2881480	2882480	What's the big deal?
2882480	2883480	Yeah.
2884480	2886480	You guys listen to it all the time together.
2886480	2887480	And, you know, she's sick right now.
2887480	2889480	Where is she right now?
2889480	2890480	Salem, Oregon.
2890480	2892480	And that's where you're from?
2892480	2893480	I grew up Montana.
2893480	2894480	And she was there, too.
2894480	2895480	And then parents got divorced.
2895480	2897480	And she went to Portland.
2897480	2898480	And now it's in Salem.
2898480	2901480	And you're going to visit her regularly.
2901480	2903480	And it's like she's sick.
2903480	2904480	I don't even know the details.
2904480	2906480	Do you want to talk about it?
2906480	2911480	Yeah, just autoimmune stuff, which kind of leads to a whole cascade of issues.
2911480	2915480	And you guys...
2915480	2920480	Since she's become sick, have been listening to the podcast as a...
2920480	2923480	Yeah, so I actually saw the movie first.
2923480	2925480	That's how I got in the podcast.
2925480	2926480	And then sent it to her.
2926480	2928480	Not knowing if she's...
2928480	2930480	You don't send Harmontown to your mom.
2930480	2931480	I think it's normal.
2931480	2933480	Yeah, why would anyone's mom like me?
2933480	2936480	And why would anyone have this relationship with their mom?
2937480	2939480	Yeah, I think...
2939480	2940480	I don't know.
2940480	2944480	When you're sick, it kind of forces you to just be more raw and honest about shit.
2944480	2948480	And I felt that in the movie and podcasts and sent it to her.
2948480	2949480	And then she just...
2949480	2951480	She like flipped out, loved it.
2951480	2954480	It's just become like a fun thing to talk about and share.
2954480	2955480	What's her name?
2955480	2956480	Renee?
2956480	2957480	Renee.
2957480	2958480	Hello, Renee.
2958480	2959480	Hello, Renee.
2959480	2960480	Hello, Renee.
2960480	2964480	So was your relationship with your mom...
2964480	2967480	Are you just one of these people that I can't relate to at all,
2967480	2972480	that just had always an unconditional, nice, healthy partnership with your mom
2972480	2973480	the whole time?
2973480	2977480	Or has the sickness transformed as you might have implied a second ago?
2979480	2982480	I wouldn't say it wasn't all rosy and perfect that way,
2982480	2986480	but I think she's always a good, loving mom, trying to love and fucking up
2986480	2988480	and doing it good.
2988480	2990480	No crazy distance or anything like that.
2990480	2991480	But yeah, just...
2991480	2993480	I mean, getting sick has definitely...
2993480	2995480	Everything all of a sudden is like...
2995480	2996480	Yeah, yeah.
2996480	2999480	And just more honest conversations and more conversations and...
2999480	3000480	Who is it?
3000480	3001480	Is it me?
3001480	3002480	It's probably you.
3003480	3005480	Is there shame in autoimmune diseases?
3005480	3006480	So sorry.
3006480	3009480	Because I always hear people with them, they say I have an autoimmune disease.
3009480	3011480	They never specify what it is.
3011480	3015480	So is like their confusion or is there overlap or what's the deal with that?
3015480	3018480	Is it just that they're all obscure and it doesn't bear mentioning?
3019480	3023480	Yeah, I feel there is kind of like a stigma of...
3023480	3026480	It doesn't seem to get as much sympathy as like a cancer or something that's...
3026480	3027480	Right.
3027480	3028480	And I don't know why that is.
3028480	3031480	A friend of mine has lupus, so that's not an autoimmune disease, right?
3031480	3032480	Yeah.
3032480	3033480	So it's different than that.
3033480	3036480	There's many kinds of autoimmune disorders and stuff?
3036480	3037480	Yeah, there is.
3037480	3038480	So what is that?
3038480	3041480	Like your white blood cells are just going away or what's...
3041480	3042480	She...
3042480	3046480	I asked her to text me today like a list of everything.
3047480	3049480	So she's hospitalized right now?
3049480	3050480	She's not hospitalized right now.
3050480	3056480	Like two years ago she was in critical care and didn't know she'd kind of come back online.
3056480	3060480	But yeah, just it's no energy if anything.
3060480	3064480	She gets a cold or anything bumps her immune system.
3064480	3066480	Like her reaction to it's really, really bad and severe.
3066480	3069480	It takes a lot longer to recover.
3069480	3070480	Just no energy.
3070480	3072480	Who is it that you talk to that tells you...
3072480	3074480	Like you're talking to doctors.
3074480	3075480	She's talking to doctors.
3075480	3076480	And what the...
3076480	3080480	It was all so shrouded in like vagaries.
3080480	3083480	Like are they always scratching their head?
3083480	3084480	Yeah, it was...
3084480	3086480	There were years where...
3086480	3090480	Because when you talk to anybody, I feel like one of the first questions you ask is,
3090480	3091480	how are you?
3091480	3095480	And it was like a year ago, I think I just told her,
3095480	3097480	like I don't want to ask that anymore.
3097480	3099480	Which you feel so guilty, right?
3099480	3101480	Like especially to your parent.
3101480	3104480	But yeah, just it was like every time.
3104480	3107480	Like well, they think it's this and now it might be this.
3107480	3109480	And it's all kind of interconnected.
3109480	3114480	So for several years now, just it's like every time we talk,
3114480	3119480	there's kind of a new idea, like a new hope, new problem.
3119480	3121480	It always just seems kind of...
3121480	3124480	So they're just kind of chasing like the symptoms of what's going on
3124480	3126480	because the immunity is low.
3126480	3127480	Yeah.
3127480	3130480	But they can't get to the bottom of the original cause.
3130480	3131480	Is there anything?
3131480	3133480	Cause for me, it's like I have this wall in front of me.
3133480	3136480	I'm like, I'm more comfortable saying things into a microphone
3136480	3138480	and a podcast in front of strangers.
3138480	3141480	Like I have no relationship with my family.
3141480	3147480	And if when one of them gets sick, everything's going to go lateral.
3147480	3149480	I have no idea how.
3149480	3151480	Erin spent our marriage warning me about that.
3151480	3155480	She lost her mom at 17 and she's like, you know,
3155480	3156480	she wasn't being mean about it.
3156480	3159480	She's just like, you have no idea how fucked you are.
3159480	3165480	Like you have no, you have no like method of dealing with this stuff
3165480	3168480	and it's going to hit you like you're not dealing with it.
3168480	3171480	Call your fucking dad at his birthday.
3171480	3172480	She wasn't mean about it.
3172480	3174480	She was trying to help me.
3174480	3179480	Like for me, it's like, it's ironically easier to talk into a microphone
3179480	3182480	to strangers like that.
3182480	3184480	It is to talk to people and I was wondering,
3184480	3187480	like, is there anything knowing that your mom is listening
3187480	3190480	to her favorite podcast, her favorite?
3190480	3195480	What is your mom's favorite podcast?
3195480	3196480	This is her favorite one.
3196480	3197480	She's not subscribed to it.
3197480	3198480	Oh, okay.
3198480	3199480	It's number one.
3199480	3206480	Is there anything that is easier to say when you're not standing next to her?
3206480	3209480	Like sharing this channel?
3209480	3210480	I don't know.
3210480	3211480	I thought that would.
3211480	3213480	No, no.
3213480	3219480	Mom, there's $400,000 worth of Nazi Deutschmarks
3219480	3222480	and the floorboards in the pied-a-terre.
3222480	3226480	Well, Renee, if you're listening, what we're going to do just to make,
3226480	3229480	you know, to send our blessings and stuff,
3229480	3232480	we're going to fill Doug the duffelbag up with gifts.
3232480	3234480	We're going to mail him to Salem organ.
3234480	3236480	Well, here's what I thought we really could do
3236480	3238480	because there should be an upside.
3238480	3240480	Fill him up with Toblerone chocolates.
3240480	3243480	The downside with these, you know, the medical industry
3243480	3245480	when they can't figure out what pill to prescribe
3245480	3247480	and what to diagnose it as and what's going on
3247480	3249480	and what to radiate and all this stuff,
3249480	3252480	the downside is Jesus Christ, what the fuck is going on
3252480	3254480	and when do I know and all this stuff,
3254480	3256480	the upside should be that uncertainty can be our friend
3256480	3261480	because within that uncertainty we can make things possible.
3261480	3264480	Like, you know, like not to be corny,
3264480	3269480	but like if we just like as egomaniacs who love our own podcast
3269480	3274480	and who admire this person for listening to a podcast
3274480	3277480	or son listens to, like we all want to be proven right.
3277480	3280480	We all want to be proven that our podcast has power
3280480	3282480	and that we're good people
3282480	3285480	and whether it comes to anything or not,
3285480	3289480	I just want to ritualistically, like for one moment,
3289480	3296480	like Renee, close your eyes, open the force fields,
3296480	3302480	like for one second, like while the bad things aren't looking,
3302480	3305480	they're napping, open up wide
3305480	3309480	and we're going to flood your system with good energy.
3309480	3312480	Everybody right now within the sound of my voice,
3312480	3315480	Dunkin' Trussell couldn't be here, he'd do this better.
3315480	3322480	Everybody beam, like all of your fucking like shitty,
3322480	3327480	ego-driven feelings of pride and ego and stuff
3327480	3329480	and like thrust them out into space
3329480	3333480	where they turn into laser beams and shoot across the sky to Renee
3333480	3336480	because when you love yourself and want yourself to be right
3336480	3339480	and want your favorite band to be the best band,
3339480	3341480	like all that stuff is good energy.
3341480	3343480	All you have to do is like just send it to somebody
3343480	3345480	who needs it right now more than anybody.
3345480	3347480	And so that's what I'm doing.
3347480	3349480	My beam is stronger than everyone's.
3349480	3354480	Renee, we are all light.
3354480	3357480	I'm so tempted to put a rap beat on him to see how you deal with this.
3357480	3360480	Well, we'll do that in a second.
3360480	3363480	Please don't fuck Renee in a rap right now.
3363480	3366480	I want you to recognize that yes, everyone's a beam of light,
3366480	3368480	so you would think it was all kind of cohesive,
3368480	3371480	but there is one strong stripe of light that represents,
3371480	3373480	of course, me and my special light.
3373480	3375480	Are you claiming stronger light beams right now?
3376480	3379480	In Gremlins, you need like a bad guy, you know?
3379480	3381480	Like, oh, there's Stripe, you know?
3381480	3383480	He's got a mohawk.
3383480	3385480	Renee knows what I'm talking about.
3385480	3389480	He was called Stripe because of the mohawk?
3389480	3393480	Well, he wasn't called Stripe because the word sounded neat.
3393480	3398480	Okay. I never connected that.
3398480	3400480	Didn't Stripe also have stripes kind of on him, too?
3400480	3402480	Wasn't he kind of stripy?
3402480	3404480	Diagonal, like he was in jail, like a hamburger?
3404480	3406480	No, you fucking dimwits.
3406480	3408480	He had a fucking stripe.
3408480	3410480	I fucking hate all of you.
3410480	3414480	You're pieces of shit and you didn't pay attention to Gremlins!
3414480	3421480	Renee, you're feeling your immune system is responding positively?
3421480	3424480	I told this lady to lower her defenses
3424480	3428480	and you just made me send toxins into the fucking, you assholes.
3428480	3430480	Now she has Gremlin hatred in her body.
3430480	3432480	She's very sorry.
3432480	3435480	I just was asking a question.
3435480	3438480	Anyways, God bless you, Renee.
3438480	3443480	Thank you so much for having an open-minded relationship with your son,
3443480	3445480	where you share the same things,
3445480	3448480	and I'm so sorry that things are going bad for you.
3448480	3451480	And we are all right now in Los Angeles because, believe me,
3451480	3454480	we have nothing better to do with our spirits.
3454480	3456480	We are sending them all to you,
3456480	3459480	and they're going in to the middle of your forehead
3459480	3463480	where there is a little tiny dent that you can't see,
3463480	3469480	and it's going through your pineal gland to the base of your skull
3469480	3473480	where there is a stem that has existed since you were a flower,
3473480	3477480	and it's going down and radiating throughout all of your body,
3477480	3486480	and it's saving you because nobody else wants that to happen
3486480	3489480	except for you and us,
3489480	3493480	and no one's paid any attention to it until now,
3493480	3497480	and you're not alone, and we're doing it.
3497480	3499480	We did it.
3499480	3501480	If it's mysterious, then it's solved.
3501480	3504480	Renee, right now I'm sending you a better beam than Dan is sending right now.
3504480	3505480	No.
3505480	3506480	He's talking too much.
3506480	3508480	I'm really concentrating on my beam.
3508480	3510480	I will admit, Renee.
3510480	3515480	That feeling you're getting right now of complete pleasure and detachment
3515480	3520480	and spiritual freedom, that's my beam.
3520480	3525480	Well, I'm not going to be a dick in Renee's unconscious.
3525480	3528480	I will admit, Renee, Jeff's right.
3528480	3531480	I kind of fucked up my...
3531480	3533480	So I accept that,
3533480	3537480	and that should be more of an example of how healing my energies are,
3537480	3542480	so in a way they're better than Jeff's because they're more acquiescent,
3542480	3544480	and that's the thing.
3544480	3547480	The nature has a way and a healing way,
3547480	3551480	and my healing way is better than Jeff's because it's not competitive.
3551480	3552480	All right.
3552480	3553480	All right.
3553480	3554480	You're healed up.
3554480	3555480	Put your shields back up, Renee.
3555480	3558480	Put them up against the assholes and the bureaucrats
3558480	3564480	and the licensed serial killers with support systems that call themselves doctors.
3564480	3567480	You have been cured purely by us.
3567480	3571480	Send us all your checks from now on.
3572480	3574480	Just make your checks payable, too.
3574480	3575480	We are now tax exempt.
3575480	3576480	No.
3576480	3578480	Harventown shield lowers.
3578480	3579480	Kidding about...
3579480	3580480	There's good doctors.
3580480	3581480	Everyone's fine.
3581480	3582480	I'm just kidding.
3582480	3583480	I'm just being a petty asshole.
3583480	3585480	When I get sick, I'll love them.
3585480	3587480	They scare me right now.
3587480	3589480	Dan, would you take...
3589480	3592480	Because you seem very affected, and I'm not joking about this.
3592480	3594480	There's a guy, Jason here.
3594480	3596480	Jason, right?
3596480	3598480	Likes the show.
3598480	3601480	He came on the show because you know that his mother is sick,
3601480	3605480	and you are clearly, if not just impressed,
3605480	3608480	almost envious of the connection that he has with his parents
3608480	3611480	as we all ought to be because it's great.
3611480	3617480	Would this ever make you more likely to call your mother and father once in a while
3617480	3619480	to create that thing?
3619480	3621480	Look, I'm not the problem in that relationship.
3623480	3625480	Dan, I'm going to do something right now.
3625480	3626480	Lower your force fields.
3626480	3627480	No.
3627480	3629480	I'm going to send you a beam.
3629480	3631480	My force fields are amazing.
3633480	3635480	No, I'm not. No, no.
3635480	3636480	Call your mom and dad.
3636480	3638480	My mother has my number.
3638480	3639480	She has my number.
3639480	3641480	She can call me whenever she wants.
3641480	3643480	But if she did, would you pick up the phone?
3643480	3644480	She doesn't.
3644480	3647480	And she says, except to tweet me and say,
3647480	3651480	nice to hear from you once in a while, text me, you ape.
3654480	3655480	It's a cold family.
3655480	3658480	Yes, that did not go the way I thought it was going to go.
3661480	3664480	I thought we were going to have a real slam dunk moment there.
3665480	3667480	This is not.
3667480	3668480	Yes.
3668480	3670480	So obviously, there's no subtext here.
3670480	3675480	Yes, of course, I want Renee and Jason to be rewarded for doing it right.
3675480	3676480	Of course I do.
3676480	3678480	I want everybody that has.
3678480	3680480	Well, this is my family.
3680480	3684480	I want everything that I do, every project I work on, everything, you know,
3684480	3686480	there's nothing unhealthy about that.
3686480	3687480	My therapist said so.
3691480	3692480	You don't have to.
3692480	3696480	You don't have to love the people that you were born, you know, next to.
3696480	3698480	It's like, that would be dumb logic.
3698480	3700480	You know, Hitler's dad.
3703480	3705480	He was supposed to be super cool.
3705480	3706480	Yeah, you're right.
3706480	3707480	It was Hitler's son.
3707480	3708480	Yeah.
3708480	3709480	Whatever.
3709480	3710480	Doesn't matter.
3710480	3711480	You know, whatever.
3711480	3712480	Who cares?
3712480	3713480	Who cares?
3713480	3714480	It's coincidence.
3714480	3716480	It's nice when people get along with their family.
3716480	3717480	Yeah.
3717480	3721480	I feel like you're wearing the oven mitt of detachment right now, Dan.
3722480	3723480	It works.
3724480	3726480	We got a guy dressed like a bag up here.
3726480	3727480	I love it.
3727480	3728480	I know.
3728480	3729480	It's nice.
3729480	3730480	Well, Jason.
3730480	3731480	It's kind of comforting to have a double bag.
3731480	3734480	Can I ask about the...
3734480	3736480	Is dad in the picture?
3736480	3737480	Yeah.
3737480	3738480	My dad's still in Montana.
3738480	3740480	Him and I get along great.
3740480	3743480	It didn't happen until like 25.
3743480	3744480	Are they all okay?
3744480	3745480	They're divorced.
3745480	3746480	Yeah.
3746480	3747480	They're divorced.
3747480	3749480	I now approve of that a lot.
3749480	3751480	Just because I don't want to seem like a bad person.
3751480	3752480	I got divorced.
3752480	3755480	So now I'm telling everyone to get divorced.
3756480	3757480	I was divorced too.
3757480	3758480	You were divorced?
3758480	3759480	Really?
3759480	3761480	How long were you married?
3761480	3763480	Just over eight months.
3763480	3765480	Wait, you just got divorced after eight months?
3765480	3767480	Doug, double bag for the listeners.
3767480	3768480	You pussy.
3768480	3769480	I went 11.
3771480	3772480	Again, you win.
3774480	3775480	Dr. High Road.
3780480	3782480	Jason, did you have siblings?
3783480	3784480	One brother and one half sister.
3784480	3786480	Are you young enough for me to ask how old you are?
3786480	3787480	38.
3787480	3788480	Okay.
3788480	3789480	No, you're not.
3790480	3792480	You're an old, old geezer.
3796480	3799480	Can we ask more questions about your life?
3799480	3801480	What are you career-wise?
3801480	3802480	Advertising.
3802480	3803480	Like a writer?
3803480	3804480	Mm-hmm.
3804480	3805480	Oh.
3808480	3809480	Did you write anything?
3809480	3812480	You're like, yeah, you know the idea that Snickers satisfies you?
3812480	3813480	I wrote that.
3815480	3817480	Some ESPN work last year.
3817480	3819480	Friend of Hell Countdown.
3819480	3820480	Samsung spots.
3820480	3821480	Stuff like that.
3821480	3822480	How does that...
3822480	3823480	The TV people.
3823480	3824480	The TV people.
3828480	3830480	Treb, why don't you have your own podcast?
3830480	3831480	This is...
3832480	3836480	I wake up every morning asking the same question.
3839480	3840480	That was a toothbrush.
3840480	3842480	Why don't I have a podcast?
3842480	3844480	Wake up every morning.
3844480	3849480	Why don't I have a podcast?
3849480	3852480	Why don't I have a podcast?
3852480	3854480	How do you guys know the boots-ins?
3854480	3857480	I worked with Dan at Radical for editing him.
3857480	3858480	Oh, okay.
3858480	3859480	All right.
3859480	3861480	Sounds like a cool place.
3864480	3865480	Nice.
3865480	3866480	Nice restraint on that one.
3866480	3867480	I was gonna...
3868480	3869480	Doug, what do you do?
3870480	3872480	Yeah, so I do the freelance PA and acting gigs,
3872480	3873480	and then I do stand-up and I write scripts.
3873480	3875480	How do you be a freelance PA?
3875480	3876480	What does that mean?
3876480	3877480	Like...
3877480	3879480	I just reach out to people who are having productions,
3879480	3881480	and then I'm like, you guys need any PAs?
3881480	3882480	Okay.
3882480	3884480	I mean, that is something that's pretty simple.
3884480	3887480	Well, most people do as well, but that's...
3887480	3889480	Guy's wearing a bag.
3891480	3895480	It's not a stretch for him to have a box for a house.
3896480	3901480	Is the strategy that if you wander up to a hot set
3901480	3904480	and they're understaffed enough that you can get on to it,
3904480	3905480	they need you?
3906480	3907480	Because there's no...
3908480	3909480	No? Okay.
3910480	3911480	If anyone comes up to you and goes,
3911480	3912480	like, hey, can I help you, sir?
3912480	3914480	You're like, no, you can't, because you're here.
3916480	3918480	If that doesn't happen, you just walk up to, you know,
3918480	3920480	Penny Marshall's trailer, knock on the door,
3920480	3921480	and she goes, yes?
3921480	3923480	And you go, like, I could have killed you.
3923480	3925480	Hire me as a PA, and this won't happen again.
3930480	3933480	Usually through Facebook and mutual friends and stuff.
3933480	3934480	All right. All right.
3934480	3935480	I wrote it. I wrote it.
3936480	3939480	I don't know. I was just amused by the concept and, like...
3940480	3941480	What's freelance?
3941480	3942480	Did you just stand up, you say?
3942480	3943480	Mm-hmm.
3943480	3944480	Yeah?
3944480	3945480	Yeah.
3945480	3946480	Did you say where you're from already?
3946480	3949480	I moved out from San Diego a little over a year ago.
3949480	3950480	Good for you.
3950480	3951480	Ah.
3952480	3953480	I had to...
3953480	3955480	Rob, you have follow-up San Diego questions?
3955480	3957480	No, no. I know where it is.
3958480	3959480	Stop.
3959480	3961480	Your question would've been, where's San Diego?
3961480	3962480	San Diego.
3964480	3966480	Jason, what's the coolest thing your mom ever did?
3967480	3969480	Ah, the coolest thing... Oh, man.
3969480	3973480	We can edit out the pause if it takes a really long time for you to...
3973480	3978480	My mom bought me a typewriter when I was, like, you know, nine.
3978480	3980480	What's a little typewriter?
3980480	3983480	For your little wing, we need a baby typewriter.
3983480	3985480	I can't hear you right now, because I'm, like,
3985480	3990480	I don't have enough toxins in my body to process the organs necessary to perceive you.
3990480	3991480	For your little typewriter.
3991480	3994480	I don't even know what's next to me. It's like a ghost.
3994480	3997480	Have the full alphabet?
4000480	4003480	Was it, like, the mini Crayola only has, like, seven colors in it?
4003480	4004480	Yeah.
4004480	4005480	Just give them the vowels.
4005480	4006480	Just the primaries.
4007480	4011480	Yeah. One cage is a goo, and one's a gah.
4011480	4012480	Yeah.
4014480	4016480	You got anything, Jason?
4017480	4022480	This is so cheesy and sweet to a ridiculous point.
4022480	4024480	You mean podcast dynamite?
4024480	4025480	Yeah.
4025480	4026480	Oh, no.
4029480	4032480	When I was little, I had asked, we had a really bad attack, was hospitalized,
4032480	4036480	and I saw a little stuffed tiger on the way into the hospital,
4036480	4039480	and just, like, little kids do, was obsessed and had to have that,
4039480	4043480	or the world went in, and she didn't have enough money to get it for me,
4043480	4049480	and then ended up, like, you know, somehow the nurse is new,
4049480	4052480	and, like, everyone kind of came together, and she was able to get it for me.
4052480	4056480	So now that I say it out loud, it sounds like this is the nicest thing the nurse has ever done.
4059480	4062480	I hadn't thought that went through all the way.
4065480	4070480	You know, behind every great nursing staff is probably a mom, like, going,
4070480	4074480	come on, let's snap on this, and they're going, what do you mean snap on this?
4074480	4076480	That's not an expression.
4076480	4081480	Well, the God is an unreliable narrator. He's drunk.
4085480	4087480	That's very sweet. I like that a lot.
4087480	4091480	So when you got the tiger, did you freak out? Are you very happy?
4091480	4092480	Yeah.
4092480	4093480	Yeah, super happy.
4093480	4096480	Did you know right away that she had gone through those lengths to get it for you,
4096480	4097480	or did you find it out later?
4097480	4098480	Yeah, I found out later.
4098480	4099480	That's great.
4099480	4100480	Do you still have the tiger?
4100480	4102480	I did. I put it in a box today because I'm moving.
4102480	4104480	That's awesome. That's great.
4104480	4110480	What did your mom tell you about, like, when you, like, what are you going to be when you grow up?
4110480	4114480	Did she ever have a talk with you about, like, when you're supposed to pick your career?
4114480	4116480	If you were going to be a bird or a bee.
4121480	4124480	Because I remember my mom saying, you can be anything you want.
4124480	4125480	There's another cool thing.
4125480	4127480	You could be a bird or a bee.
4128480	4131480	So wait, there's this awesome lady that gave you all this support and the typewriter.
4131480	4133480	You still don't call this woman?
4133480	4135480	Jeff, why don't you stick a fucking...
4137480	4138480	Like...
4138480	4141480	My four steels are down. You can stick it wherever you want right now.
4142480	4144480	Hey, have a little ice.
4146480	4147480	Boom!
4147480	4148480	Do you want a drink, Jason?
4148480	4150480	Yeah, I'll have a drink.
4150480	4151480	See?
4151480	4152480	You want any ice in it?
4152480	4153480	You better get it.
4153480	4155480	You better say yes soon.
4155480	4156480	Because he's taking it off.
4156480	4159480	Empathy. I just practiced empathy.
4159480	4161480	And believe me, I really have to practice it.
4162480	4165480	You got a little bubble throat? What was that? You got a little burp?
4165480	4166480	Yeah, a little burp.
4167480	4168480	I believe you.
4173480	4175480	Smells like gum up here.
4178480	4179480	Do you have gum?
4179480	4180480	That's me.
4180480	4181480	Oh, wow.
4181480	4183480	You're like Walter Cronkite.
4183480	4185480	You're so good.
4185480	4187480	Well, there was like an opening here.
4187480	4189480	I felt like there's my...
4189480	4192480	You're busting these scoops right open.
4192480	4193480	I hope that...
4193480	4197480	I have this image of my head of Jason going back home to see his mom.
4197480	4200480	And he's like, did you hear the episode?
4200480	4202480	And she's like, yeah, that was great.
4202480	4204480	And he's like, yeah, I just thought...
4204480	4205480	I mean, I didn't have any choice.
4205480	4206480	Like, he called me up.
4206480	4208480	And then she's like, yeah, it's just like...
4208480	4209480	I like the podcast.
4209480	4213480	I don't understand why you had to be on the worst episode.
4216480	4218480	The worst episode ever.
4218480	4220480	With the worst combination of people.
4221480	4223480	With just terrible people.
4223480	4224480	Yeah, yeah.
4224480	4226480	Doug, you're really fucked up.
4227480	4229480	I guess I'll pack up and go home.
4229480	4231480	A guy dressed as a fucking bat.
4232480	4233480	Wait, what was that?
4233480	4235480	I guess I'll pack up and go home.
4235480	4236480	Ah, you motherfucker.
4236480	4237480	I love it.
4237480	4238480	I can't say that at you.
4238480	4239480	Hey, Doug.
4239480	4240480	Zip it.
4242480	4243480	Here, Jason.
4243480	4244480	Jason.
4244480	4245480	Here we go.
4245480	4246480	Thanks.
4246480	4247480	What are you going to have?
4247480	4248480	I'm kidding.
4248480	4249480	Here to have this.
4249480	4250480	It's a red cup.
4253480	4255480	Yeah, my chiropractor...
4256480	4257480	What's his name?
4257480	4258480	Well, I'm not going to say...
4258480	4259480	Oh, yeah, that's right.
4259480	4260480	Because of the lawsuit.
4263480	4264480	I will say this.
4264480	4265480	The malpractice?
4265480	4266480	He...
4266480	4269480	You know, he goes by doctor and then his first name.
4269480	4271480	Like, he sounds like a children's show.
4272480	4273480	Period.
4273480	4274480	And he...
4274480	4277480	Like, I came in a couple weeks ago.
4277480	4280480	I've been going to this guy three days a week for six months.
4280480	4282480	Because I've been committed because every...
4282480	4284480	I've had a terrible back since I was 17.
4284480	4285480	So I...
4285480	4288480	And now I'm like, okay, before I go get back surgery,
4288480	4290480	which never works out for anybody,
4290480	4294480	probably should have talked about this stuff before hearing Rene's story.
4294480	4296480	Not exactly sounding like a hero right now.
4297480	4298480	The...
4300480	4301480	Like, he...
4301480	4302480	So he starts...
4303480	4305480	I go in one day and he starts...
4305480	4309480	He touches, like, right above my right buttock.
4310480	4311480	And I don't know...
4311480	4313480	I don't really know what happened.
4313480	4314480	Show us on the doll.
4314480	4315480	Yeah.
4315480	4316480	Yeah.
4316480	4317480	Above the right buttock.
4317480	4318480	Okay.
4318480	4323480	The dolls are for kids that don't have an anatomical word power.
4323480	4324480	Above the right buttock you.
4324480	4325480	Ooh, ooh la la.
4326480	4327480	Sorry.
4328480	4331480	My hatred of the two of you tonight.
4331480	4332480	Sorry.
4332480	4333480	Go on.
4334480	4336480	And Doug, you keep egging them on.
4338480	4339480	What?
4339480	4340480	They say neutral here, right?
4340480	4341480	They oohed like that was a bad product.
4341480	4342480	Yeah.
4342480	4345480	They're like, I'll figure out how eggs are related to luggage later.
4345480	4347480	I'm a fucking android.
4347480	4348480	Neek, moo, mop.
4348480	4350480	Now I hate all of you.
4351480	4353480	Listen to me.
4354480	4356480	I am pouring myself out to you.
4356480	4358480	I have a bad chiropractor.
4359480	4360480	All right.
4360480	4361480	So he's rubbing your butt.
4363480	4366480	He touches, like, this area above my butt and he gets...
4366480	4367480	Are the lights on or off?
4369480	4371480	That sounds to me like sciatic nerve area, right?
4371480	4372480	That's right above, like...
4372480	4373480	It says sciatic.
4373480	4375480	It definitely sounds sciatic.
4376480	4378480	Sounds like a sciatic issue.
4379480	4381480	Sounds like a right buttock.
4381480	4382480	Yeah, it's probably sciatic.
4384480	4388480	You gotta check that out, man.
4389480	4392480	Sciatics go crazy, man.
4392480	4393480	That shit'll spread.
4399480	4400480	And he goes, oh.
4400480	4402480	And I'm like, wait, what?
4402480	4403480	And he goes, it's so responsive.
4403480	4405480	My butt.
4405480	4406480	Okay.
4408480	4411480	And he's like, are you having any trouble there recently?
4411480	4412480	I go, no, not at all.
4412480	4413480	Maybe it was just like a thing.
4413480	4415480	He's like, yeah, something going on there.
4415480	4418480	So then he's like, you know, he takes...
4418480	4419480	You helped in pain?
4419480	4421480	No, I didn't do anything.
4421480	4422480	I didn't feel anything.
4422480	4425480	I haven't had any problems since I started going to the guy.
4425480	4428480	Like, I started going to him because I threw out my back as I do every four years.
4428480	4431480	And then this time I'm like, okay, commitment to change.
4431480	4432480	I'm 42.
4432480	4433480	My back's not gonna get better.
4433480	4434480	I'm gonna go to one chiropractor.
4434480	4439480	Instead of, like, resisting all of them and saying, just fix my back, quack.
4440480	4441480	Yakety yak.
4441480	4444480	Don't, don't, don't adjust back.
4444480	4448480	Like, I'm gonna go to one guy and I'm gonna listen to his spiel and I'm gonna commit to the thing.
4448480	4449480	Three days a week.
4449480	4450480	Eat your celery.
4450480	4452480	Whatever the fuck he wants.
4452480	4453480	So...
4453480	4454480	I've eaten a lot of celery.
4454480	4455480	Doing this.
4455480	4458480	Don't get distracted by everything shiny.
4462480	4465480	I would've rhymed yakety yak with saccharilliac.
4466480	4468480	Why don't you guys...
4471480	4473480	The two of you...
4473480	4475480	It could be such a good podcast.
4475480	4478480	It was just me and Spencer and Dave the Devilbag.
4480480	4481480	Duck, duck, duck.
4481480	4482480	And Carlos the...
4482480	4483480	The Jesus.
4484480	4485480	Carlos the...
4485480	4486480	Carlos the Jesus.
4486480	4487480	Spaceship builder.
4487480	4494480	So when you say eating your celery, do you mean to imply that you were doing all the things that the guy told you?
4494480	4497480	Spencer, are you on my shit now?
4497480	4498480	I'm just...
4498480	4500480	You're being, you're being very defensive.
4500480	4504480	We're trying to, we're trying to help the story down the river.
4504480	4506480	Well, no, I'm being accusatory.
4506480	4507480	Okay.
4507480	4510480	Okay, so here's something that I didn't do that the guy told me to do.
4510480	4511480	Here we go.
4511480	4516480	I haven't been not sitting down for more than 30 minutes in a row.
4516480	4518480	This is, I think, the most important part.
4522480	4523480	Busted.
4524480	4525480	All right.
4525480	4527480	You know sitting's the new smoking.
4528480	4529480	Oh, yeah.
4529480	4532480	Since obviously this story isn't totally...
4532480	4536480	You know, I'm just going to get through it because obviously it's not...
4536480	4540480	No one's on my side and I'll just get through it, okay?
4540480	4545480	Because my job isn't to make people like me and it's not to bend the truth, it's to express myself.
4545480	4546480	That's my job as an artist.
4546480	4547480	Okay.
4547480	4550480	So I'm just going to tell you what happened and I'm not, I don't care.
4550480	4551480	So one of the things...
4551480	4552480	I don't care if you like it.
4552480	4553480	One of the things...
4553480	4556480	You're not supposed to sit for more than 30 minutes at a go ever.
4556480	4557480	Which is insane.
4557480	4558480	It's also a great guideline for everybody.
4558480	4560480	What if you're driving to San Diego?
4560480	4563480	You should stand up every 30 minutes.
4564480	4565480	It's not...
4565480	4566480	It's very simple.
4566480	4567480	Give me a fucking break.
4567480	4568480	We invented sitting.
4568480	4569480	Come on.
4569480	4571480	We invented smoking.
4573480	4575480	Which is the old sitting.
4576480	4581480	I think there's a Scandinavian poet who said, blessed is he who sits down.
4582480	4583480	Okay, I want to hear the rest of the story.
4583480	4586480	You're walking down the street and when the guy comes out and he goes,
4586480	4587480	Hey!
4587480	4589480	What story are you listening to?
4592480	4594480	He comes back from the chiropractor.
4594480	4595480	The sun is gone.
4595480	4596480	Hey!
4596480	4597480	The sun is gone.
4597480	4598480	Hey, come on.
4598480	4599480	Hey, come on.
4599480	4600480	Come on.
4600480	4601480	Let's go.
4601480	4603480	He focused on my butt for a long time.
4604480	4607480	When I got up, I knew, it was like, man, he really got in there.
4607480	4609480	He really did some shit.
4609480	4611480	It was like, must be for the greater good.
4612480	4614480	Was he smelling his finger?
4615480	4616480	See?
4616480	4617480	Good.
4617480	4618480	It's only a matter of time.
4619480	4620480	Yeah, turn on him.
4620480	4621480	I know.
4621480	4622480	I know.
4622480	4623480	It is only a matter of time.
4623480	4625480	He's a national treasure.
4625480	4626480	You know what?
4626480	4628480	This guy loves Gamergate.
4629480	4630480	It's not true.
4631480	4634480	I literally do not know what that means at all.
4634480	4636480	I have no idea what that means.
4636480	4640480	This guy's got a aggregate tattoo on his fist.
4640480	4641480	I don't know what that means.
4641480	4646480	So I can punch people that give bad journalism ethics.
4646480	4648480	I have no idea what you're talking about.
4648480	4649480	Is what they...
4649480	4650480	All right.
4651480	4652480	This guy's a bald one.
4652480	4654480	He's not even related to the real bald ones.
4655480	4656480	Here we go.
4656480	4657480	I was thinking about a bald one.
4657480	4658480	Here we go.
4658480	4659480	Focus on my butt.
4659480	4660480	I get up.
4660480	4661480	I'm like, oh, man, my butt's weird.
4661480	4662480	I walk around.
4662480	4664480	Butt starts hurting like day one.
4664480	4665480	Butt hurts a little bit.
4665480	4667480	Renee, are you still with us?
4667480	4668480	Are you listening?
4668480	4669480	Okay.
4669480	4670480	But day two.
4670480	4671480	Butt hurts a little bit more.
4671480	4672480	Day three.
4672480	4673480	Butt hurts.
4673480	4674480	Renee's like, yeah, this is great.
4674480	4676480	I'm pressing the morphine button.
4676480	4677480	I don't...
4677480	4681480	You're the worst storyteller and your story is not compelling.
4683480	4687480	So the time goes on and I'm in debilitating pain.
4688480	4689480	I can't walk.
4689480	4690480	I'm limping.
4690480	4693480	So I limp into the chiropractor's office the next week.
4693480	4696480	And I go, look, I'm limping.
4696480	4698480	And I'm like, I've made up my mind.
4698480	4700480	I just want to hear what this guy has to say.
4700480	4702480	I'm not doing shit.
4702480	4704480	I'm not going to go in with an agenda.
4704480	4708480	I'm just going to limp in and I'm going to answer questions honestly
4708480	4711480	and I'm going to wait for him to self-destruct.
4711480	4712480	Good plan.
4713480	4716480	So I limp in and he goes, oh, hey.
4716480	4719480	Oh, what happened?
4719480	4722480	And I go, I don't know.
4726480	4731480	And I limp over to the table and I take out my pocket sundries
4731480	4734480	and I put them on this little OCD table.
4735480	4742480	And I put my face in his fucking rented fucking Frankenstein platform.
4742480	4744480	And he lowers me down.
4744480	4746480	And I was like, what's going on?
4746480	4747480	What happened?
4747480	4748480	And it's like, I don't know.
4748480	4754480	I'm in an excruciating amount of totally new, completely un-ever felt before pain.
4754480	4758480	Like, I've had lots of back pain, but this is a new type of pain.
4758480	4762480	And it's in that area you kept focusing on.
4763480	4766480	And I just got my face down to the thing.
4766480	4770480	And he goes like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4770480	4773480	I mean, that's why I focused on it and I knew this would happen.
4775480	4776480	And I said...
4776480	4778480	Somebody hissed.
4779480	4784480	Because somebody took a logic course and is offended by this man having...
4784480	4787480	But also loves old-timey pantomime.
4788480	4793480	And I was like, you knew it was going to happen?
4793480	4796480	And he's like, yeah, remember when I was like, oh, this area is special?
4796480	4798480	I was like, yeah, I remember that.
4798480	4801480	But it wasn't giving me a problem before.
4802480	4804480	And then he focused on it.
4804480	4809480	And he's like, yeah, I was focusing on it because I knew any day now this is going to go kablooey.
4809480	4816480	And I got my face down and I said, that's one interpretation of the data?
4818480	4819480	What do you mean?
4819480	4827480	Well, another way of looking at it would be you caused it.
4827480	4828480	Silence.
4828480	4829480	What?
4832480	4833480	No.
4833480	4834480	What are you talking...
4834480	4838480	And he just flew into this flurry of defenses that made me...
4838480	4840480	I'm going to go back and see him on Tuesday.
4840480	4844480	But this guy's on thin ice.
4844480	4845480	He was like...
4845480	4847480	I said, I'm not going to say another word.
4847480	4848480	I didn't say that.
4848480	4849480	I wasn't going to say another word.
4849480	4850480	I didn't say another word.
4850480	4852480	I let him say everything.
4852480	4856480	And then during the next 15 minutes while he adjusted me and didn't help at all,
4856480	4859480	he was just babbling all these defenses.
4859480	4862480	And his two main planks of argument were...
4862480	4865480	At one point he said, I mean, you know this little...
4865480	4869480	This gun I use, does it even seem to you like it can do that much?
4873480	4874480	He's got a gun?
4876480	4878480	It's a little spring-loaded gun.
4878480	4880480	Don't get distracted by that.
4880480	4881480	It's spring-loaded.
4884480	4885480	Is it like a little jackhammer?
4885480	4886480	It's like a little...
4886480	4887480	That's why I liked it.
4888480	4889480	She's a little...
4889480	4891480	Because I never understood why you get a bad back.
4891480	4893480	And Jeff, don't start about your chiropractor.
4893480	4895480	I will fucking like...
4895480	4897480	Jeff, I have a really good chiropractor.
4898480	4902480	Everybody that doesn't have a bad back has a really good chiropractor.
4903480	4908480	Because chiropractors lay you on a table and crack your back like a knuckle.
4908480	4909480	And it feels good.
4909480	4910480	You know why?
4910480	4915480	Because fluids going back into compressed discs of muscle tissue between your vertebrae.
4916480	4918480	And it's like, oh, yeah, it feels good to crack your knuckles too.
4918480	4920480	It doesn't help anything.
4920480	4922480	Especially when they crack it both ways.
4922480	4923480	You're not aligning anything.
4923480	4925480	You're not doing anything.
4925480	4928480	And so I was happy that the guy had a little fucking Willy Wonka gun.
4928480	4931480	Because I was like, actually, this is what I always thought in my head.
4931480	4934480	Like, well, if you're going to do something, why don't you just take a little hammer and chisel
4934480	4936480	and bang the vertebrae around.
4936480	4938480	Well, he fucking banged me around.
4939480	4941480	So this was his other argument.
4942480	4945480	He goes, you've been seeing me for six months.
4945480	4948480	What about all the other times you came in here and you weren't limping?
4950480	4951480	Good night, folks.
4953480	4961480	Yeah, like logic, logic, not a big thing at the, you know, Dr. Carl's chiropractic pavilion.
4962480	4963480	Dr. Carl's!
4963480	4966480	Yeah, I mean, yeah, don't get offended, chiropractors.
4966480	4968480	You're not real doctors.
4969480	4971480	I mean, I don't know.
4971480	4974480	I'm just imagining like a cold reading, like psychic.
4974480	4978480	And if he's going down and he's telling you all this stuff about your life,
4978480	4981480	and then he's just like, and your mom, her name is Melvin, right?
4981480	4982480	And you're like, no.
4982480	4984480	And he's like, but I was right about all that other stuff.
4984480	4988480	It's like, you're still, you're doing magic tricks.
4988480	4989480	I told you the thing.
4989480	4992480	Every time he would feel my neck, after a while, he started going like,
4992480	4993480	you mentioned you smoke pot.
4993480	4995480	Did you smoke pot Wednesday?
4995480	4996480	Oh, no.
4996480	4998480	And I go like, yeah, I guess so.
4998480	5000480	And he's like, yeah, I can tell.
5000480	5001480	You can tell?
5001480	5003480	Yeah, your neck's boggy.
5004480	5005480	My neck's boggy?
5005480	5006480	And he's like, yeah.
5006480	5007480	So I did that.
5007480	5008480	Boggy's not even a...
5008480	5009480	Yeah, no, that's what I said.
5009480	5011480	Boggy's not a word people use.
5011480	5015480	So I did that three times with him, where I answered him honestly.
5015480	5018480	But it's like, and then, but here's the thing.
5018480	5020480	And I don't like lying to people.
5020480	5024480	But the thing is, when I start to suspect that you're so fucked up or dishonest,
5025480	5029480	it's like, no matter what my answer was, because I would go,
5029480	5031480	no, I didn't smoke pot yesterday.
5031480	5032480	I smoked pot two days ago.
5032480	5034480	And he's like, yeah, sometimes it takes 48 hours.
5034480	5039480	And so I was like, why aren't you trying to sell me on the idea
5039480	5043480	that you can read pot use by neck feeling?
5043480	5048480	That's not even on the list of requirements for you to do your job.
5048480	5050480	Why are chiropractors always...
5051480	5054480	It's always different, and it's always this extra thing.
5054480	5057480	They always have to go like, oh, yes, of course you'll lay on the table
5057480	5058480	and I'll crack your back.
5058480	5062480	But did you know that spines started Christmas?
5062480	5064480	And you're always like, what?
5064480	5067480	It's always like, I know I have these salt crystals for sale
5067480	5070480	or this candle of the Virgin Mary, and you're like, you too?
5070480	5073480	Isn't there a fucking legitimate person among you?
5073480	5074480	No, there's not.
5074480	5076480	So we always lay a bunch of shit around it,
5076480	5081480	like some weird overzealous shrine that protests too much.
5081480	5085480	And so this guy's whole shtick is like, oh, the chemical abuse
5085480	5088480	and the emotional abuse, like, oh, yeah, yeah.
5088480	5091480	Okay, so I'm supposed to stand here and argue with you
5091480	5095480	that I'm a great person psychologically, emotionally, and chemically
5095480	5098480	in order to prove that you're not a doctor?
5098480	5103480	So I have to lead a monastic life and become perfect,
5103480	5106480	and then I can finally bust you.
5106480	5108480	Maybe that's the treatment.
5108480	5114480	Yeah.
5114480	5117480	You're talking about it.
5117480	5123480	You're talking about it.
5123480	5127480	I'd rather, you know, I'm fine, I'm fine with my bad back.
5127480	5131480	I just, I just, I don't like this guy.
5132480	5133480	Don't go.
5133480	5135480	It sounds like you just shop around a little bit.
5135480	5136480	You don't have to go, man.
5136480	5138480	I've shopped around for years.
5138480	5139480	Don't go back.
5139480	5140480	Don't go back.
5140480	5141480	I'm going to go back one more time.
5141480	5143480	I just want to tell him.
5143480	5146480	Don't go back to the chiropress.
5146480	5148480	That was the joke he was making.
5148480	5149480	It was bad.
5149480	5156480	Okay, well, you know, I did it again.
5156480	5158480	You know, I've been on edge lately.
5158480	5160480	You know, I've been a bad person.
5160480	5162480	You do.
5162480	5163480	I got a divorce.
5163480	5164480	That's not bad.
5164480	5165480	That doesn't make you bad.
5165480	5168480	It's made me, I'm on, I'm not a good person lately.
5168480	5171480	I'm seeing injustice and dishonesty where there isn't any.
5171480	5172480	Example.
5172480	5174480	I'm seeing a lot of it where there is some,
5174480	5176480	but like where you wouldn't normally call it out.
5176480	5179480	Can I read you a, I want to read you.
5179480	5180480	Here we go.
5180480	5182480	I want to read you a text message.
5182480	5188480	Passage from the Bible.
5188480	5192480	John three 16.
5192480	5195480	There is a guy who installed our aquarium.
5195480	5196480	Hmm.
5196480	5198480	Every, every, every week.
5198480	5199480	Go long.
5199480	5200480	That's right.
5200480	5201480	Yes.
5201480	5204480	Well, I mean, let's respect his privacy.
5204480	5209480	I'm sure there's a million go lawns in the aquarium business.
5209480	5211480	Also as his name implies,
5211480	5215480	don't fuck with him or he will melt you with a death ray.
5215480	5218480	Go lawn detects intruders.
5218480	5224480	Neil before go long girl on resume starter fish protocol.
5224480	5227480	Go on has selected live coral.
5227480	5231480	Your aquarium guy texts you.
5231480	5232480	Yeah.
5232480	5234480	And every week he texts basically the same thing.
5234480	5236480	Hey, what's up?
5236480	5237480	I don't know.
5237480	5239480	I'm sitting around hanging out.
5239480	5240480	No, no, he doesn't do that.
5240480	5242480	No, but that would be hilarious.
5242480	5243480	Okay.
5244480	5246480	I can keep going.
5249480	5253480	I want to see that scene play out.
5253480	5257480	The two of you are going to miss me when I'm gone.
5257480	5260480	Like I'm going to jump off a fucking spalding gray.
5260480	5261480	No, no, don't.
5261480	5262480	No, don't.
5262480	5263480	Yeah.
5263480	5264480	His back hurt.
5264480	5265480	No, come on.
5265480	5266480	Yeah.
5266480	5267480	And his friends didn't support him.
5267480	5268480	And then one winter night.
5268480	5269480	No, come on.
5269480	5270480	All right.
5270480	5273480	I'm over dramatic being a weird man.
5273480	5278480	Well, I was trying to, I was trying to be funny, but then I remembered that you
5278480	5280480	constantly think I'm going to kill myself.
5280480	5281480	Yeah.
5281480	5286480	Which is hilarious to me because I don't think you could kill yourself.
5286480	5289480	I think you just could fucking die, man.
5291480	5292480	Murder.
5292480	5300480	I always had you pegged for just a random bullet coming, like flying like just
5300480	5301480	through a car.
5301480	5304480	You're going to have one of those random gunshot things that happen.
5304480	5307480	Like you're going to, ah shit, I dropped the remote.
5309480	5311480	That was an ill time to get up.
5311480	5312480	All right.
5312480	5315480	I dropped the remote and ducked into the path of it.
5315480	5316480	Yeah.
5316480	5320480	If you hadn't dropped the remote, you would have died.
5320480	5325480	If I had suddenly sat in my White House Oval Office chair and ran the country.
5325480	5328480	But the ironic thing is I was sitting right there.
5328480	5331480	ISIS was aiming for the Roomba.
5331480	5335480	And they get that remote, ah fuck, I'm dead now, ah shit.
5335480	5336480	So every week he texts.
5336480	5340480	And then your ghost is like, ah shit, fuck, ah.
5340480	5344480	Every week he texts, we will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow,
5344480	5346480	arrival 11 to 1.
5346480	5348480	And then sometimes we go, thanks.
5348480	5350480	Or sometimes we ignore it, doesn't matter.
5350480	5352480	They come, they service the aquarium once a week.
5352480	5353480	Serve it.
5353480	5356480	So then, God damn it.
5356480	5360480	So then, so this is on the heels.
5360480	5362480	This is, I'm just explaining, like my therapist told me, she's like,
5362480	5367480	you're going to notice that you're having like these, like, aquarium issues.
5370480	5375480	You're not going to be in control of your judgment about, ah,
5375480	5378480	dishonesty and outrage and things like that.
5378480	5380480	And she told me this after I did this.
5380480	5382480	And I was like, okay, that makes sense.
5382480	5385480	But I still haven't apologized to this guy.
5385480	5390480	He says, like last week he goes, we will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow,
5390480	5391480	arrival 11 to 1.
5391480	5393480	Aaron texts, thank you.
5393480	5398480	And then he goes, please help me, smile face, LOL.
5398480	5404480	And then I think, and then the next text he goes, yelp.
5404480	5405480	He's correcting himself.
5405480	5410480	And then the next thing he goes, not help, ha ha.
5410480	5415480	So then I said, it's notable that when you wanted us to yelp you,
5415480	5419480	an impersonal corporate need, you added a smiling emoticon
5419480	5422480	and an abbreviation for laughing out loud.
5422480	5425480	But when you saw you had accidentally expressed a human plea for help,
5425480	5431480	jeez Louise.
5431480	5436480	Creating a personal human need for clarification.
5436480	5440480	You typed ha ha, which was unmistakably sincere.
5440480	5444480	It's like humanity has never lost its capacity for clarity,
5444480	5448480	yet actively seeks the fog of ambiguity.
5448480	5452480	And technology is only the latest excuse.
5452480	5454480	And then the next message is from him a week later going,
5454480	5460480	we will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow.
5462480	5465480	I don't think you should apologize.
5465480	5467480	I don't think you should apologize.
5467480	5470480	Well, I don't feel any remorse, so the apology wouldn't work.
5470480	5471480	Right, yeah.
5471480	5473480	I don't think I should have done it.
5473480	5474480	That's regret.
5474480	5476480	I think he looked at it and went, what the f...
5476480	5477480	Yeah, he's like, I'm go...
5477480	5478480	That was it.
5478480	5479480	I don't need this shit.
5479480	5482480	He probably thought you were talking to Aaron or something.
5482480	5483480	He probably went, I don't...
5483480	5485480	Yeah, exactly.
5485480	5488480	If that shit worked, community would have had higher ratings.
5489480	5492480	So if he's like washing the tank and you're like sitting there...
5494480	5496480	Sorry about that.
5496480	5497480	No, no, I'm not.
5497480	5498480	No, I don't know.
5498480	5500480	No, he should be ashamed of himself if he feels anything.
5500480	5501480	I know, I know.
5501480	5502480	I agree.
5502480	5503480	But he doesn't.
5503480	5505480	I'm telling you, you don't apologize.
5505480	5506480	It's going to be...
5506480	5507480	Oh my God.
5507480	5508480	Please yelp me.
5508480	5509480	It's fine.
5509480	5510480	But he mistyped, please help me.
5510480	5511480	Ha ha.
5513480	5514480	No, it's shameful.
5514480	5515480	A society is shameful.
5515480	5516480	It's a good bit.
5519480	5525480	Like, I was noticing a seam in the cracks, but it was like, I don't need to...
5525480	5526480	I don't need to...
5526480	5527480	I don't have time.
5527480	5528480	Ain't nobody got time for that.
5528480	5529480	No, no, no.
5529480	5530480	You don't need to...
5530480	5531480	No.
5531480	5532480	You don't need to text the aquarium guy.
5532480	5533480	That's tough.
5533480	5534480	He's fine.
5534480	5536480	You can't bend a little hard on him, I think.
5536480	5538480	I just think, you know...
5538480	5542480	I think you were procrastinating from doing something else.
5542480	5545480	Yeah, I was writing like one of nine books or movies.
5545480	5549480	I could either write something or I could let this guy have it.
5549480	5552480	I could do 300 words on this poor fucking guy.
5552480	5553480	Yeah.
5553480	5556480	Here's an audience, no matter how bad a writer I am, I'm a genius.
5556480	5557480	Ha ha ha.
5557480	5558480	Hey, aquarium guy.
5558480	5561480	Oh, my life is in the sea in yellow leaf.
5562480	5564480	Holy cow, you're like Shakespeare.
5565480	5566480	Thank you.
5567480	5569480	The fish tank is in the corner.
5570480	5571480	I know.
5572480	5573480	I put it there.
5574480	5581480	She saw the text and then read it and then just realized that you didn't need to text back.
5581480	5582480	Yeah.
5582480	5583480	Probably one of those.
5583480	5584480	What a clarity.
5584480	5585480	Probably one of those.
5585480	5588480	He probably didn't show it to all of his friends and go, look at this fucking shit.
5591480	5594480	He's probably not talking about that right now at a bar.
5594480	5595480	Yeah.
5595480	5596480	Yeah.
5596480	5601480	I'd like to think that when he looked at it, he was like, I don't know what any of this
5601480	5609480	is, but I guess I should only use this phone number to say I'm coming to service the aquarium.
5609480	5615780	I think maybe I stepped over a little bit of a trip wire when I started using it to
5615780	5621480	engage in my fucking off-market branding.
5621480	5622480	What the fuck?
5622480	5623480	Fuck you, man.
5623480	5625480	I already gave you money.
5625480	5627480	I used your aquarium service.
5627480	5628480	No, you're a hero.
5628480	5629480	You're definitely...
5629480	5638480	You're definitely the Batman in this situation here.
5638480	5641480	You're totally the John McClain of this diehard.
5641480	5642480	No, thank God.
5642480	5645480	Thank God you're out there.
5645480	5647480	Thank God you're out there.
5647480	5651480	Thank God you're out there protecting us.
5651480	5653480	Holy shit.
5653480	5654480	Oh my God.
5654480	5655480	Well, that guy's...
5655480	5656480	Yeah.
5656480	5657480	It's a delusion.
5657480	5658480	I'm not in my right mind.
5658480	5659480	Nope.
5659480	5660480	Nope.
5660480	5665480	You know what I'm used to is you're either in control or not in control of your impulses,
5665480	5667480	but your thoughts are pure.
5667480	5671480	I'm not even thinking right.
5671480	5674480	Someone will come into the room and go, what time is it?
5674480	5678480	I'll think they're saying you're working too slowly.
5678480	5680480	I'll treat them...
5680480	5683480	Are you feeling a mixture of things?
5683480	5684480	Is it anger?
5684480	5685480	Where is it?
5685480	5686480	I'm just like...
5686480	5687480	It's a heightened...
5687480	5688480	It's like everyone's lying.
5688480	5689480	Everyone's a liar.
5689480	5690480	I'm like holding Caulfield.
5690480	5691480	I'm like...
5691480	5693480	No one's saying what they mean.
5693480	5695480	You're holding Caulfield.
5695480	5696480	Jesus Christ.
5696480	5700480	I want to fucking kill you and all of you are holding Caulfield.
5700480	5703480	Everybody's a liar.
5703480	5708480	I could put this Caulfield down if people would start telling the truth.
5708480	5713480	He's only back on the show because you guys liked him.
5713480	5715480	That's me.
5715480	5718480	That's me being a good person.
5718480	5720480	You see what it does to me.
5720480	5722480	You see how much it hurts me.
5722480	5723480	No, no, no.
5723480	5727480	The guy from Silicon Valley said, I can't show up tonight.
5727480	5728480	No.
5728480	5729480	All right.
5729480	5732480	So I'm talking about Camille.
5732480	5733480	Hey, Doug.
5733480	5735480	Doug, when you got divorced, did you go through any of that?
5735480	5737480	Does this ring true for you?
5737480	5739480	Do you have any aquarium problems?
5739480	5742480	No aquarium problems.
5742480	5744480	Were you lashing out at people and stuff like that?
5744480	5745480	No.
5745480	5751480	The marriage was so bad that when the divorce happened, it was like, this is very positive
5751480	5753480	for everyone involved.
5753480	5754480	I mean, that's...
5754480	5755480	It wasn't like any of...
5755480	5756480	That's everybody.
5756480	5757480	It was...
5757480	5758480	But you guys...
5758480	5759480	Chemically, things didn't work.
5759480	5766480	Was it just like a hastily like, I don't want to die alone, let's get married, and then,
5766480	5767480	holy shit.
5767480	5771480	And then like, pressure from parents and church growing up and stuff like that.
5772480	5777480	But this time I know, for the next time...
5777480	5782480	Always fall in love with a person.
5782480	5787480	And then really decide you want to spend your life with them.
5787480	5791480	Got it.
5791480	5793480	I knew I forgot something.
5793480	5795480	God damn it.
5795480	5796480	Diamond lanes.
5796480	5798480	They don't even work anymore.
5798480	5801480	That's not a reason to get married.
5801480	5806480	You could carpool.
5806480	5810480	Will you gentlemen stay up here and role play with us?
5810480	5811480	Yeah, absolutely.
5811480	5812480	Shadow run?
5812480	5813480	What do you think?
5813480	5814480	Oh, you don't like that idea?
5814480	5815480	No, I don't mind it.
5815480	5819480	I say, oh shit, in response to all sorts of things.
5819480	5822480	I think that Doug should play a bag of holding.
5825480	5826480	Do I get quips?
5826480	5827480	Do I get to...
5827480	5832480	Oh yeah, you can crack wise as a sack of all you want.
5832480	5833480	Sack cracks.
5833480	5836480	That's your segment.
5836480	5838480	Whenever you say it, we're going to put it for the subscribers.
5838480	5839480	We're going to write, sack cracks.
5839480	5844480	Sack cracks with double bag Doug.
5844480	5846480	You okay playing this game, Mr. Strob?
5846480	5847480	Me?
5847480	5848480	Yeah, I'm fine with it.
5848480	5849480	This guy hates games.
5849480	5850480	I hate him.
5850480	5852480	I don't like him.
5852480	5854480	Nobody likes him really.
5854480	5856480	Yeah, that's why they call them games.
5856480	5859480	Because everyone hates them.
5859480	5862480	No, people don't like him.
5862480	5863480	Right.
5863480	5864480	What's your least favorite game, Rob?
5864480	5867480	Like if you're at a party and people say, let's play something.
5867480	5869480	I bet you hate Pictionary.
5869480	5871480	Oh God, I fucking hate Pictionary.
5871480	5874480	Holy shit, I fucking hate Pictionary.
5874480	5876480	And you think you'd love it because you're a good artist.
5876480	5877480	You can draw.
5877480	5880480	Yeah, but there's always like, you know, Rob's on my team.
5880480	5881480	Rob's on my team.
5881480	5882480	And then I got...
5882480	5884480	I didn't even say I was playing.
5884480	5886480	Oh, you're playing.
5886480	5887480	Oh, you're playing.
5887480	5888480	You fucking have to play.
5888480	5890480	And I'm like, no, I don't.
5890480	5891480	I don't have to do anything.
5891480	5892480	It's America.
5892480	5894480	And I can do whatever I want.
5894480	5897480	And if I want to sit here in the corner, I can totally do it.
5897480	5899480	I don't even have to look at you.
5899480	5902480	And I go, no, you're fucking on my team and you're doing it.
5902480	5904480	And then it's like...
5904480	5905480	I fucking hate that.
5905480	5906480	I hate that game.
5906480	5907480	Yeah.
5907480	5908480	I hate him.
5908480	5909480	I hate anything with cards.
5909480	5911480	Cards suck.
5911480	5913480	You're a control freak.
5913480	5914480	No, I don't like games.
5914480	5915480	You're a control freak.
5915480	5916480	Why is that a new control freak?
5916480	5920480	Games are things where other people are in charge of whether you're doing well or doing
5920480	5921480	bad.
5921480	5922480	I don't like any competition.
5922480	5924480	I know control freaks that love games too much.
5924480	5925480	Like, control freaks are...
5925480	5926480	Yeah, what about him?
5926480	5929480	Yeah, the people that have to run the game or...
5933480	5935480	Look, I am a self-confessed control freak.
5935480	5939480	I'm just saying, like, Rob is like, undiagnosed and won't admit it.
5939480	5940480	If he could just realize...
5940480	5943480	It's like, a guy that's good at drawing should look forward to Pictionary.
5943480	5944480	No.
5944480	5945480	Rob doesn't look forward to Pictionary.
5945480	5947480	It has nothing to do with him being able to draw.
5947480	5948480	It's like, he doesn't like...
5948480	5951480	Here's another thing Rob doesn't like.
5951480	5952480	The Happy Birthday song.
5952480	5953480	Oh, I fucking hate that.
5953480	5954480	I hate it.
5954480	5956480	Because it's compulsory.
5956480	5958480	Nobody likes the Happy Birthday song.
5958480	5959480	Nobody likes to sing it.
5959480	5960480	Yeah, but no one hates it.
5960480	5962480	Nobody likes to hear it, right?
5962480	5964480	Because you have no choice.
5964480	5965480	Because the cake comes out.
5965480	5967480	If you don't say Happy Birthday, you're a dick.
5967480	5971480	And if you don't smile until this song's over with, you're a fucking asshole.
5971480	5973480	Nobody likes doing it.
5973480	5974480	Nobody has ever liked doing it.
5974480	5978480	And there's always some fucking dick at the end that has to harmonize.
5978480	5981480	I'm in my way.
5981480	5984480	Oh, yeah.
5984480	5987480	And like, get the fuck out of here, man.
5987480	5991480	I didn't live this long to hear your shit on my day.
5991480	5993480	On your day?
5993480	5994480	On my day, yeah.
5994480	5995480	I hate that.
5995480	5998480	You don't like the Happy Birthday song no matter whose birthday it is.
5998480	5999480	No.
5999480	6003480	You don't like having to do anything that other people have to do.
6003480	6004480	Yeah.
6004480	6005480	Does anybody?
6005480	6006480	I can relate to it.
6006480	6008480	But you have to do this.
6008480	6009480	No.
6009480	6010480	Nobody wants that.
6010480	6011480	I'd love that, yeah.
6011480	6013480	You're like, I hate the Happy Birthday song.
6013480	6014480	Because you have no choice.
6014480	6015480	You have to do it.
6015480	6016480	Right.
6016480	6017480	You have to do it.
6017480	6021480	There's a million things you have to do that some of them you do, some of them you don't.
6021480	6023480	You're like focused on the Happy Birthday song and Pictionary.
6024480	6025480	I put the blinker on.
6025480	6026480	I know.
6026480	6031480	I have a pitch that I've tried to get a groundswell of support for this.
6031480	6034480	This becomes the new Happy Birthday song.
6034480	6036480	The Happy Birthday song is not a great song.
6036480	6037480	It's not a great song.
6037480	6038480	It's a stupid song.
6038480	6039480	I can sing it.
6039480	6041480	And most national anthems are stinkers.
6041480	6042480	Yeah, they're stinkies.
6042480	6043480	Yeah.
6043480	6044480	Like, South America's got some really cool ones.
6044480	6046480	They sound like crazy circus marches.
6046480	6047480	They're really good.
6047480	6050480	Do you know how you guys sound?
6050480	6051480	It's like...
6051480	6055480	Are you going to go on this right now?
6055480	6058480	Let's make some improvements to Christmas.
6058480	6061480	Hey, what's a tree doing in the living room?
6061480	6063480	It can't grow here.
6063480	6066480	We should put it back outside where there's dirt.
6066480	6067480	What are you left with?
6067480	6068480	THX1138.
6068480	6070480	You guys have no culture.
6070480	6071480	You have no tradition.
6071480	6073480	Who cares if the song's good or bad?
6073480	6074480	It's a goddamn tradition.
6074480	6076480	Yeah, but I'm saying, here's my fix on it.
6076480	6077480	It's a pitch.
6077480	6078480	I think this should be a thing.
6078480	6079480	You still keep it.
6079480	6081480	It's still the same thing.
6081480	6083480	When the cake comes, you go,
6083480	6086480	Happy birthday to you.
6086480	6089480	And that's the end of it.
6089480	6090480	Why do you have to fucking sing?
6090480	6092480	Why do you even have to fucking sing?
6092480	6095480	It's a smattering of glass from people that are terrified of you.
6095480	6096480	People are scared of you.
6096480	6098480	They got my Maggie's farm reference.
6098480	6099480	Same people.
6099480	6100480	Smart people.
6100480	6101480	They're scared of you.
6101480	6102480	They should be scared.
6102480	6103480	Well, they are.
6103480	6105480	But they don't believe in you.
6105480	6106480	It's a dumb song.
6107480	6108480	They're scared of you.
6108480	6110480	You're an abusive person.
6110480	6111480	Wow, man.
6111480	6112480	You're edgy as shit.
6112480	6116480	I like you when you're on edge because you're a TNT right now.
6116480	6118480	You're fucking like nitro blistering.
6118480	6123480	What's that movie like, Wages of Fear, where Eve Montana has to drive a truck full of high explosives?
6123480	6126480	Don't try to own my own-ability.
6126480	6127480	I'm owning you right now.
6127480	6128480	No, you don't.
6128480	6130480	I'm bigger than your butterfly nut.
6130480	6133480	I'm a butterfly the size of the fucking Mothra.
6133480	6134480	You know the smartest person this room is?
6134480	6136480	The person that clapped when I said Wages of Fear, Eve Montana.
6136480	6137480	Smartest person in the building.
6137480	6138480	That's convenient.
6138480	6139480	The smartest guy.
6139480	6140480	He's always the guy.
6140480	6141480	Might have been a woman.
6141480	6142480	Might have been a woman.
6142480	6143480	Might have been Dave Klein.
6143480	6144480	We don't know.
6144480	6145480	Yup.
6145480	6147480	Dave Klein, are you here?
6147480	6150480	A Criterion Collection, Wages is for free self.
6156480	6158480	Pretty solid indeed, Dave Klein.
6158480	6160480	Got some good extras.
6160480	6162480	Pretty sweet extras.
6162480	6164480	Yeah, that'll be lost on a lot of people.
6164480	6166480	Yeah, Dave Klein just did like a...
6166480	6167480	Yeah, I don't know.
6167480	6173480	Dave Klein, who's famous for being a bellicose Viking, sounded like a comic book.
6173480	6175480	Yeah, he likes his French film.
6175480	6180480	I mean, happy birthday.
6180480	6185480	I think it's good it's your birthday.
6185480	6187480	Why do you gotta do anything?
6187480	6190480	Oh shit, he's beatboxing.
6190480	6191480	Why do you have to do anything?
6191480	6192480	Okay, Rob.
6192480	6196480	Why can't you just eat the cake?
6196480	6198480	I love cake.
6198480	6200480	Why do we have windows?
6200480	6205480	If you want to see outside, why don't you dig a hole through your wall?
6205480	6207480	Why do we use forks?
6207480	6210480	Why don't you just grab food and stick it in your ear?
6210480	6212480	Why do we have teeth?
6212480	6213480	Why did we grow teeth?
6213480	6214480	They fall out.
6214480	6219480	Why don't you just take the teeth, put them in a box, and then put food in your eyes?
6220480	6222480	Why do we have an alphabet?
6222480	6227480	Why can't we just point at things that we mean and go like, ugh!
6227480	6229480	Why are we wearing clothes?
6229480	6233480	Why aren't my big, giant, weird balls hanging out?
6233480	6241480	Making my dick look small, which is an illusion.
6241480	6246480	It's like a bus park next to the Epcot Center.
6247480	6250480	Buses are big.
6250480	6255480	If you didn't have a podcast and weren't kind of a celebrity, you just said this in the corner,
6255480	6259480	you'd be fucking locked away for good.
6259480	6261480	Here's a tangent.
6261480	6265480	You're one microphone and a couple cameras away from being a crazy person.
6265480	6269480	Here's a tangent.
6269480	6270480	Surely not.
6270480	6271480	No, no, no.
6271480	6275480	You said Epcot Center, and I was thinking about this the other day, and I forgot to...
6275480	6277480	I forgot to look on Wikipedia.
6277480	6281480	Does anybody know what the EO in Captain EO stands for?
6281480	6282480	I mean, anybody?
6282480	6283480	New Day or something?
6283480	6284480	New Day.
6284480	6286480	N-D.
6289480	6291480	Captain N-D.
6291480	6292480	EO?
6292480	6295480	EON, it's like a new...
6295480	6296480	EON.
6296480	6299480	EON, but they ran out of...
6299480	6301480	ENDS?
6301480	6303480	Endocrine omission?
6304480	6305480	Electric overload.
6305480	6308480	I think that's what happened to Michael Jackson, right?
6308480	6311480	So, unprofessional.
6316480	6319480	That was a Hail Mary.
6320480	6321480	You okay, Dan?
6321480	6322480	Now you're doing the thing where...
6322480	6323480	No, I'm not okay.
6323480	6324480	I already said I wasn't.
6324480	6328480	Your body language now is you're going into hugging yourself mode.
6328480	6330480	Somebody has to.
6331480	6336480	You know, I don't care about any of you.
6338480	6340480	So not true.
6340480	6345480	I mean, I wish you all the best, but, like, I don't need you to love me.
6345480	6346480	Yep.
6346480	6352480	And because I can tend my own garden, I can meet my own emotional needs.
6352480	6355480	What if we loved you anyway without your consent?
6355480	6363480	It would go into a trough outside my moat, which is guarded by laser turrets, for a good reason.
6363480	6366480	And you can leave it there as an offering, and maybe one day I'll come out and go,
6366480	6368480	oh, thank you, symbolically.
6368480	6372480	But this place is solar powered.
6372480	6374480	It runs on soy.
6374480	6378480	So, saying thank you is like saying happy birthday to me.
6378480	6381480	Is me saying the happy birthday song?
6381480	6388480	On a micro level, I'm an even worse person than you because when people fish for an apology or gratitude,
6388480	6390480	I get thrown...
6390480	6394480	I can sing happy birthday, but if I'm in a situation where I feel like,
6394480	6399480	oh, this person's expressing that they've been offended, my first thought is not,
6399480	6403480	oh, by default, whether I mean it or not, I'm sorry.
6403480	6406480	My first thought is like, fuck you, phony.
6406480	6409480	Your feelings weren't hurt, you piece of shit.
6409480	6410480	You fucking lying piece of shit.
6410480	6413480	You're trying to hurt me with your fucking fake feeling hurting.
6413480	6417480	This is exactly how I feel about the happy birthday song.
6417480	6422480	Word for word, let's just, you know, it's a big enough world for both of us.
6422480	6424480	I never said I was saying it and you're crazy.
6424480	6431480	I was saying, like, Kiefer Sutherland's character in Lost Boys saying to the other guy...
6431480	6433480	How's their maggots?
6433480	6438480	Like, just be a vampire with us and fly around.
6438480	6441480	Okay, I'll do it.
6441480	6446480	Just take that old record off the shelf.
6446480	6450480	I don't know if that was in the soundtrack, though.
6450480	6453480	I'd watch that. I'd watch that movie.
6453480	6456480	All right, six minutes of Shadow Runner.
6456480	6459480	Rob just successfully filibustered his way out of us playing this game.
6459480	6460480	No, no, no, no, no.
6460480	6462480	What was this about, Captain EO?
6462480	6465480	You really just dropped that, like, a hot rock.
6465480	6467480	Wait, so Captain EO is supposed to stand for New Day?
6467480	6468480	Nobody just take one.
6468480	6469480	Do we know why it's EO?
6469480	6474480	I just read it. It was named after Eos, the goddess of the New Dawn, so something like that.
6474480	6476480	Why do you ask, though?
6476480	6477480	I keep getting a haircut.
6477480	6478480	That's what I want to know.
6478480	6480480	Rob Shrob. Rob. I'm listening.
6480480	6482480	I think I've spoken about this before.
6482480	6483480	We've spoken about this before.
6483480	6485480	Why did you ask that question? I need to know.
6485480	6490480	Because Dan's at Epcot Center and I remembered, like, about a week ago I was going,
6490480	6496480	I wonder what EO stands for, and then I should look it up on Wikipedia,
6496480	6497480	and I was driving.
6497480	6499480	You shouldn't do that while you're driving.
6499480	6502480	By the time I got home, I forgot, until now.
6502480	6504480	I always would recommend the wake of the video with driving.
6504480	6505480	That's my thought process.
6505480	6508480	Yeah, it was really disappointing. I'm sorry I asked.
6508480	6513480	I always get Aaron. How come every time I'm on the show I get Aaron?
6513480	6516480	Just trade with Doug.
6516480	6517480	Doug or Jason?
6517480	6521480	He'll do anything. He wore a bag.
6521480	6522480	Uh-oh.
6522480	6523480	Oh, shit.
6523480	6527480	Oh, shit. All my secrets fell out.
6527480	6529480	And my phone.
6541480	6542480	Oh, my God.
6542480	6547480	What would you estimate, six months of our friendship early on,
6547480	6552480	when every time I took a bite of anything in front of you, you made a fart sound?
6552480	6554480	For entire meals, and I was just like...
6554480	6556480	You'd get so mad.
6556480	6557480	You'd be like...
6557480	6558480	I mean...
6558480	6564480	If you only knew that you getting mad made me want to do it more.
6564480	6566480	Oh, yeah, I never figured that out.
6566480	6567480	That it was obviously...
6567480	6569480	So just, just, just like...
6569480	6570480	So just love it.
6570480	6571480	Yeah.
6571480	6572480	And then you'll stop.
6572480	6573480	Yeah.
6573480	6574480	Well, that's...
6574480	6576480	You never, you never tried it once.
6576480	6577480	Never tried it once.
6577480	6578480	Never tried it once.
6578480	6579480	Never tried it once.
6579480	6585480	Never tried to enjoy yourself and my company once.
6585480	6586480	Once.
6586480	6588480	I'm going to be on a respirator.
6588480	6595480	Because I'm ten years older than you are, and you won't be there.
6595480	6597480	So it's all right.
6597480	6598480	It's all right.
6598480	6599480	It's all right.
6599480	6600480	You'll have shit to do, you know.
6600480	6604480	That'd be funny, though, if he came in, and he hadn't talked for a long time,
6604480	6606480	so you guys kind of went through different ways for a while.
6607480	6608480	The respirator thing is going up and down.
6608480	6609480	Every time it went down, he went...
6612480	6614480	If you do that, I'll live an extra day.
6614480	6615480	How about that?
6616480	6617480	All right.
6617480	6618480	If you do that, deal.
6619480	6620480	I'll...
6620480	6621480	One more day.
6621480	6622480	One more day.
6622480	6623480	I'll go, all right.
6623480	6626480	No, the last six months, because that's my estimate.
6626480	6627480	It was like...
6627480	6632480	It was just like, yeah, so anyways, and then I take a bite, and it's like...
6633480	6636480	Yes, and it's like an entire burger.
6636480	6639480	We're going to, every time with the fart, every time I take a bite.
6640480	6642480	It was never not funny.
6642480	6644480	It was always funny.
6644480	6645480	Also...
6645480	6646480	Kate hates it, too.
6646480	6648480	Kate hates it.
6650480	6651480	Also, I love...
6651480	6653480	We started hanging out in the three of us.
6653480	6658480	We would go to movies, and any time it was kind of a sexual innuendo, it was zip.
6659480	6662480	You had a really great one that made the whole theater laugh one time.
6662480	6663480	I forget what it was.
6663480	6664480	Do you remember what it was?
6664480	6666480	No, Dan had it for The Matrix.
6666480	6667480	Oh, it was you?
6668480	6673480	What was it like after Neo was working out all the...
6673480	6676480	He's like doing it, and then he came back, and he was like,
6676480	6678480	Oh, dude, I'm so tired.
6678480	6681480	He goes to sleep, and then this guy comes out.
6681480	6687480	You better get rested up, because you're going to get it even more tomorrow, or something like that.
6687480	6689480	And Dan went, zip.
6691480	6693480	And the guy in front of us went...
6699480	6701480	This guy's really funny.
6701480	6703480	I knew he sat in the right place.
6705480	6708480	I told the story before that, when we went to see...
6708480	6712480	When we were in Milwaukee, we went to see Mortal Kombat, the movie.
6713480	6717480	And the guy goes, the evil villain has a ball at dinner, and then he goes,
6717480	6718480	And now...
6720480	6727480	And it's like me and Shrob, the 3 p.m. matinee, so it's two dudes and a million kids.
6727480	6728480	Just kids.
6728480	6731480	All their parents dropped them off to see the Mortal Kombat movie.
6731480	6733480	And two fucking loser...
6734480	6736480	Nowadays, it would be against the law.
6736480	6738480	They would be like, guys, we don't...
6738480	6740480	Just to be safe, get out of here.
6741480	6743480	And we would be like, yeah, you're probably...
6743480	6746480	I mean, better safe than sorry, you're right.
6746480	6748480	I don't even want anything to be awakened in there.
6748480	6750480	There's a lot of kids here.
6752480	6753480	Some of her...
6753480	6754480	Now that's on record.
6754480	6756480	Look, it's summer.
6756480	6758480	They've got the overalls, or it's adorable.
6758480	6760480	Get to the story, get to the story.
6763480	6765480	It's not funny now, because of the chair.
6765480	6766480	It's still funny.
6766480	6768480	But why are they leaking those audio?
6768480	6769480	What is that?
6769480	6773480	Okay, so the Mortal Kombat guy goes,
6773480	6777480	now a taste of things to come.
6779480	6780480	Shrob does that.
6780480	6783480	And a fucking sea of children.
6783480	6784480	Wow!
6785480	6786480	They were like...
6786480	6787480	I was...
6787480	6790480	You know in 2001, when they're all like,
6790480	6794480	fast forward through all of them being scared of the monolith.
6794480	6798480	And then when the monkey kills the other monkey with the bone,
6798480	6800480	and it was just like...
6800480	6802480	They didn't know you could do that.
6802480	6805480	It was like, now a taste of things to come.
6805480	6808480	And the whole theater was like,
6808480	6809480	what?
6809480	6811480	Wow!
6811480	6814480	You could make your own movie about farts?
6816480	6818480	And it's got fucking my favorite video game
6818480	6822480	and farting in it, and it's oh, and for the rest...
6822480	6824480	It was on a win stack.
6824480	6825480	Yeah.
6829480	6831480	And I'm not complaining about this at all,
6831480	6832480	because it's not like the movie was good,
6832480	6834480	but it was like, yeah, the rest of the movie,
6834480	6835480	of course, as you could imagine,
6835480	6837480	every single line of dialogue.
6837480	6839480	I was just like, do you want two?
6842480	6846480	Like 4,000 children all trying their hand at this new...
6846480	6847480	Technology?
6847480	6848480	No.
6848480	6850480	Ape must not kill Ape.
6850480	6852480	They all got the AK-47,
6852480	6854480	and they're just like shooting it everywhere.
6855480	6857480	It was the best day of their lives.
6858480	6861480	We had unfinished business from when we were that age.
6861480	6864480	We walked out of there pretty cool, man.
6865480	6868480	We walked out in slow motion to put our sunglasses on,
6868480	6870480	high-fiving, yeah.
6870480	6872480	Like that Adam Sandler movie,
6872480	6873480	like when he...
6873480	6876480	Tried out at home when your folks are watching TV.
6876480	6878480	They all went home and made crude sculptures out of you guys
6878480	6880480	in the backyard.
6880480	6881480	And I feel kind of like, for some reason,
6881480	6884480	because I remember we went to see Land Before Time 2,
6884480	6886480	and I feel like the only reason
6886480	6888480	is because we wanted to repeat our success,
6888480	6890480	and then a dinosaur was like,
6890480	6892480	how can I reach that tree?
6893480	6894480	Nothing.
6894480	6895480	Crickets.
6895480	6896480	Only if I ever got...
6896480	6897480	I've only tried that out,
6897480	6900480	like trying to crack wise for the whole con.
6900480	6903480	It was a hard target directed by John Woo,
6903480	6905480	and it was like John Cloth and Dan,
6905480	6907480	and Wolfram Brimley and Lance Henriksen,
6907480	6908480	and it was directed by John Woo.
6908480	6910480	I just really, from the back row,
6910480	6912480	really quite went, whoo!
6913480	6915480	Got a pretty good laugh.
6916480	6917480	Yeah.
6919480	6921480	Isn't that as funny as a fart?
6924480	6925480	No, not even close.
6925480	6928480	I recall, I don't remember what it would be,
6928480	6930480	but we went and saw The Triplets of Belleville.
6930480	6931480	Remember that animated movie?
6931480	6932480	I think so, yeah.
6932480	6933480	And you laid one...
6933480	6934480	No.
6934480	6935480	You did a zip in Triplets of Belleville.
6935480	6936480	I think you did.
6936480	6937480	Where would I do it?
6937480	6939480	I don't know, I don't know.
6939480	6941480	Triplets of Belleville.
6942480	6944480	Yeah, but you were kind of ahead of your crowd,
6944480	6946480	but you did a poopy joke,
6946480	6948480	and it still worked.
6948480	6950480	Okay, I believe you.
6950480	6952480	Dave Kline, do you like Triplets of Belleville?
6952480	6953480	Yep.
6955480	6958480	We don't get time for this shit, the show's over.
6958480	6959480	Yeah.
6959480	6960480	Renee Pollack is like,
6960480	6962480	are they going to talk about me again?
6962480	6965480	Because really, this is a terrible episode.
6965480	6967480	This is one of my favorite episodes of all time.
6967480	6968480	Best day of my life.
6968480	6969480	Huh?
6969480	6970480	Best day of my life.
6970480	6973480	Lucky Doug, the duffel bag.
6973480	6975480	I need to hear it from Jason.
6981480	6983480	Just say it's a good episode.
6983480	6984480	It's a great episode.
6984480	6986480	Seems fake now.
6986480	6989480	All right, let's just play a little quickie shadow run.
6989480	6991480	All right, Spencer, where are we?
6991480	6993480	You're in the bar.
6993480	6994480	Okay.
6994480	6996480	Who are we talking to?
6996480	6997480	You're just in the bar.
6997480	6999480	We're in between missions right now, right?
6999480	7000480	We're freelancers right now.
7000480	7001480	Yeah, yeah.
7001480	7003480	We can do anything we want.
7003480	7004480	All right.
7004480	7008480	I get up on the bar and I go across the bar
7008480	7011480	and I give a wink to the bartender and I say,
7011480	7013480	I'll take it from here and I just start pouring
7013480	7015480	everybody's shots at the bus.
7015480	7016480	All right.
7016480	7017480	Okay.
7017480	7018480	That works?
7018480	7019480	He's okay with that?
7019480	7020480	Yeah, man.
7020480	7021480	All right, cool.
7021480	7023480	I go into the bathroom.
7026480	7027480	No, not even close to me.
7027480	7028480	Oh, okay.
7028480	7029480	That's what happens.
7029480	7030480	That's what happens in there.
7030480	7031480	Okay.
7031480	7035480	I look in the mirror and it's just like...
7035480	7036480	That was funny.
7036480	7037480	Okay.
7037480	7038480	I'll let everybody else.
7038480	7041480	I'm sure that takes a turn, so I'll let everybody else.
7041480	7043480	You look in the mirror and you say what?
7043480	7046480	Do you have a little internal monologue now?
7046480	7047480	No, you go.
7047480	7048480	We're not in combat, man.
7048480	7049480	Yeah, you can do it.
7049480	7050480	All right.
7050480	7052480	Well, I look in the mirror and I'm staring at myself
7052480	7054480	and I'm not blinking until my eyes dry out
7054480	7057480	so that my face looks the way it really is
7057480	7060480	in my unconscious mind, which is more reptilian than human.
7062480	7065480	I'm fantasizing about tearing the reptile skin off
7065480	7067480	and finding something real underneath it.
7068480	7071480	And I'm just angry and sad.
7071480	7073480	And I...
7073480	7075480	Are the facilities...
7075480	7078480	Do they still have those motion-detecting faucets?
7078480	7080480	Have they perfected those in the future?
7080480	7082480	No, they scrapped that whole idea.
7083480	7085480	It's back to just like turning faucets.
7085480	7087480	Yeah, especially out in the variance.
7087480	7088480	Yeah.
7088480	7089480	All right.
7089480	7090480	Then I splash some water in my face
7090480	7093480	and then I rest my forehead on the mirror
7093480	7094480	and I'm just like,
7094480	7097480	you gotta get your shit together, James Nightblade.
7098480	7100480	You gotta get your shit together.
7101480	7102480	Hey, how you doing?
7104480	7105480	Gotta use some soap.
7109480	7110480	Man!
7111480	7113480	We've had a lot of adventures together.
7117480	7118480	It's crazy, man.
7118480	7119480	It's crazy, crazy.
7119480	7121480	This dark future, man.
7124480	7126480	I've seen so many bad things, man.
7127480	7130480	That's probably nothing compared to all the stuff you've seen.
7131480	7133480	I'm gonna try a little bit more soap here.
7135480	7137480	Hands are so dirty.
7140480	7142480	Gotta get under the fingernails, man.
7142480	7146480	That's where all the diseases live, you know?
7146480	7147480	That's what I heard at least.
7148480	7149480	Boy.
7151480	7154480	Man, we should get out of here.
7154480	7158480	We should just like get in a vehicle and just go.
7158480	7159480	Just go someplace.
7159480	7162480	Just pick a direction and try to chase the sun.
7162480	7164480	Why don't we keep saying we're gonna do that?
7164480	7165480	We'll never do it.
7167480	7168480	Which character?
7169480	7171480	Who is this?
7172480	7173480	I think he's horrid.
7173480	7174480	I wanna open up that.
7174480	7176480	I hope he's nowhere that we've ever met in a little.
7176480	7177480	Who is your character?
7177480	7178480	What does it say?
7178480	7180480	It's too much, too much character.
7182480	7185480	I wanna open up that homemade paper business.
7187480	7190480	And you've always wanted to go back to your...
7190480	7192480	Go back to your, like...
7192480	7195480	You know, I've never really talked to you before.
7196480	7199480	I don't even know anything about you, man.
7199480	7201480	This is so different tonight.
7202480	7205480	Maybe it's all the shots I've been drinking from...
7205480	7207480	You know, they're giving them away in there.
7207480	7210480	You better get some because they're going fast, you know?
7210480	7212480	But man, you know, I mean, like, come on.
7212480	7214480	You know, I mean, you're still young.
7214480	7215480	I'm still young.
7215480	7217480	Why are we fighting all the time?
7217480	7218480	Just go.
7218480	7219480	Chase the sun.
7219480	7220480	Chase the moon.
7220480	7221480	Follow the earth.
7221480	7223480	The equator, you know?
7223480	7225480	This goes someplace we've never been before.
7225480	7227480	Why don't we ever do that?
7227480	7228480	We always said we would.
7228480	7231480	Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
7231480	7232480	What?
7232480	7234480	There's a map on the other side of this soap.
7234480	7235480	You can't say that.
7235480	7236480	You can't do that.
7236480	7238480	Cliffhanger!
7245480	7247480	I'm so sorry, Renee.
7248480	7252480	Renee, we will send you a better episode next week.
7252480	7253480	It will...
7253480	7254480	Impossible.
7254480	7255480	You guys don't leave.
7255480	7257480	We'll just record the episode again.
7257480	7259480	Let's hear it for Renee and Jason, everybody.
7259480	7261480	Get well with Renee.
7262480	7265480	All of our love is shooting out in magnificent beams toward you.
7265480	7268480	Let's hear it for Doug the duffelbag.
7271480	7274480	Rob Shroff.
7278480	7281480	Spencer Critton and I'm Jeff Davis.
7281480	7284480	Your mayor is Dan Harmon, everybody.
7285480	7287480	Zach on audio back there.
7287480	7288480	Justin Marshall, our producer.
7288480	7291480	Chris Beruff, the director.
7291480	7295480	A whole slew of millennial children.
7295480	7298480	Some of them just, like, 11.
7298480	7300480	Just marching around with blood on their face,
7300480	7303480	like the dolls in Barbarella.
7303480	7304480	Good night, guys.
7304480	7305480	Thank you so much.
7305480	7306480	See you next week.
7306480	7308480	See you next week, I am assuming.
7315480	7317480	Did you get any of that?
7317480	7320480	It's a good show!
