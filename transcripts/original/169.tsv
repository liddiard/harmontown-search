0	18560	From Hollywood, California, it's so good to be back here in the spacious, well, not spacious,
18560	26160	the, the, let's be honest, it's cozy, as Greg Prusa said, the cozy and salubrious confines
26160	38040	of Meltdown Comics, once again, Harmon Town is now in session. Let's welcome Spencer Crittenton
38040	50080	to the stage, shall we? Hello, Spencer. And the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
56400	66560	Sorry, young man, sorry. Hello, hello. Ooh, spooky. It's scary here tonight. It's scary every year,
66560	74960	all the time this year. That's everything gets so scary, Jeff. You went on a haunted hay ride
74960	82160	last night. I did go on a haunted hay ride, yeah. It was scary finding out, finding out,
82160	92000	I can't sit cross-legged anymore. Oh, the ghost of your thirties. You didn't even know they were
92000	99600	dead. Wait, your knees were aching or what? I just couldn't, okay, here's what, the haunted hay ride
99600	104960	is you, so, okay, so I didn't even, thank you for bringing up the haunted hay ride. This is
104960	114240	amazing, I had nothing. You've missed proper controlling since I've been away, huh? Damn,
114240	125680	shots fired, Curtis Armstrong. Talking to you, the K-12, dude. So, okay, come on, no tangents if you're
125680	132480	a man of your word. My job is to keep you on a straight thread all the way through to the finish
132480	138960	line here. We've got an important show tonight. Everything has been hammered out and if I wander,
138960	145360	it's a crime and it ain't mine. I ain't doing the time. Squeeze your ass like a piece of lime.
145360	149360	I fucked your mama so hard she gave me an extra dime. I said, I'm gonna call you.
154160	160800	I'm drawing a line. All right, so, yeah, that's great. You're right to applaud. It's absolutely,
160800	165760	I have nothing but respect for you. The more that you encourage me, because it means you're
165760	172800	good people because I love myself. All of that was sarcasm, but don't worry about it. You're
172800	184480	fine. You know that we're all smoke and light. I'm killing. Or you're the worst. Anyway, sorry,
184480	192080	that got to you. I'm channeling Andy Kindler because he's here tonight. I feel like I was,
192080	196000	like, I'm, like, biting some of his new locks. You're not allowed in a vessel to hold the
196000	200960	majesty that is Andy Kindler. No, no, nobody is. I'm just saying, like, I'm doing some weird,
200960	207200	like, I'm such a fan that I'm kind of, like, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't discount the idea that
207200	212560	I'm kind of, like, enchanted and sort of, like, have a Kindler spell cast on me. Yeah, I think
212800	217760	when Andy Kindler enters the room, if you have any antenna at all, they're hitting a certain
217760	225520	frequency of high speed, alacrity, cunning. And the double, triple, quadruple self-awareness
225520	231280	that turns into such self-denial that it's, like, a swirling... I think we can say that if he doesn't
231280	237440	come at her and give us the greatest comedy show of all time, then I got him pegged all wrong.
239680	248800	So, yeah, he went out. He went to get a sandwich. Oh, okay. So the haunted hayride,
248800	254080	okay, so you go on it, doesn't matter. For me, the haunted hayride is a thing that just
254080	259920	haunts my ability to get home in Los Feliz because it clogs up traffic from the five all the way to
259920	266000	my place. I don't drive anymore, but I went there, and you're being driven, you know, there's a
266000	269920	tractor. When you're there, that's the irony, is that you're driving and you're, like, going slower
269920	274640	than the tractor. Are you sitting on physical hay, proper hay? Yeah, there's hay, so, but there's no
274640	281840	chairs, so that's the thing. You can't put a chair on hay. But here's the thing about hay and not
281840	287440	having chairs and hayrides, even haunted ones I would have assumed before the two nights ago,
288080	293840	that they're, like, I don't know why you'd be riding on hay, but I know that you wouldn't be
293840	302160	doing it with 65 people. No, it should be you and Terry Gar. It should be you and Terry Gar,
302160	308000	or Andy Kindler, or, like, Mike Nesmith. I don't care who it is. As long as there's four to eight
308000	314560	of them. That would be a fucking good hayride. Me too, Kindler, Terry Gar, and Mike Nesmith.
315520	322160	You guys are gonna have to Google three quarters of that to find out why it would be dynamite.
323920	329760	You're gonna love it. Like, when I call them the Knievel of Kvech, I'm like, just Google.
330960	337120	But it's hay, so, okay, so, what happens is... Is it loose? I'm picturing it like a hay wagon.
337120	346080	It's loose hay. It's loose, slippery, like, effectively lubricating hay. It's not bales of
346080	352240	tightly bound, healthy dog shit, like, firm, like, like, like, like, like, like,
352240	357040	like nobody's met at table scraps. It's like... You revealed some of your own backstory on that.
357040	362000	No, I have. The fact that my dog takes nice, firm, healthy poops. And that even...
362960	367600	Stop what you're doing. Because I'm about to ruin the things that you're used to.
369120	372880	All right, just stop. Everybody's... Just let me get through the fucking... My name is Humpty.
372880	379760	There's nothing... Like, there was one thing, so, about the chain link. There was a chain link area.
379760	384720	When you stand in line and you get into the... There's a chain link area, right, before you're
384720	390480	getting into the hay cart. And they have it all worked out. They've been doing this for a long time.
390960	398080	Not the scary parts, but the crowd control parts. The scary parts are apparently decided on by
398080	407840	committee three weeks before each thing. And I don't even know... I walked out with so many questions.
407840	413200	I was like... Like, did they... Are they just upset about school shootings? Is that why they just,
413200	418160	like, just threw, like, random shit out there and just hoped it was a little scary but not upsetting?
418160	425600	Like, it was like a mildly uncomfortable hayride. I would not call it haunted in the
425600	432960	least by anything. Like, except for, you know, the ghost of pride in craftsmanship.
435200	440800	I mean, that was certainly there. Like, going, remember me, you forgot me. And I was like, no,
440800	447200	the ghost of my... There's too many ghost jokes. So, take me through it. You're cruising along,
447280	451200	I'm imagining at, like, one mile an hour as you're going through various little townships.
451200	455440	I have something to tell you about before that, though. Because the line, you're in line. And I
455440	460480	was actually happy to be... There was VIP tickets for, like, five dollars more where you can, like,
460480	465280	walk past people. And I'll do that in a fucking... I would do that.
467520	475760	Under normal circumstances, I would pay 500 times more than you would for the fun of walking around
475760	483920	you if I had to walk eight more times the distance. I would just be so happy just to be
483920	491760	moving. I would just walk around you and, like, and be rich. I am not a man of the people.
493200	500480	But I did not buy a VIP ticket on purpose because I was so high, I was scared,
500480	507840	that I was going to get scared. Because I said, Dino, I don't like the people touching you.
507840	513600	And he said, they can't touch you. They can't touch you. They're not allowed to touch you.
514640	519760	Which is, like, the scariest thing in the world. They're not allowed to touch you.
521040	525680	It sounds a little scary. But then they keep repeating that. They don't touch them. They
525680	531520	won't touch you. They're not allowed to touch you. You're not allowed to touch them.
532320	537520	It's like being in Jonestown. And then there's, like, these...
538160	543440	Okay. So you go through the line and then you get into this chain link area that's designed to hold
543440	550800	not the number of people, but the volume of flesh. When the chain link thing, right,
550800	558320	before you get on the hay cart, is full of human tissue. They close it behind the last person.
558320	563680	After they've shamed the front people, you know, come on, come on, move in, move in.
563680	569200	And I thought the guy at first, I was like, oh, is he, like, a bad UCB or I.O. guy doing, like,
569200	574160	a southern character to, like, create an air of, like, because otherwise he's, like, in the middle
574160	579920	of Los Angeles, like, bossing people around who are drunk and high and thought it would be funny
579920	585920	if they paid you to try to scare me, motherfucker. And, like, and I thought that's actually brilliant
585920	590400	that he, that they've adopted, like, this southern thing. This is, like, something that people in LA
590400	594480	are, like, maybe, like, oh, shit, I saw, I saw those movies. I'm not gonna fuck with this guy.
595360	596880	Yeah, this guy's Ned Beatty.
596880	601760	But he was too authentic and too unfunny to have been trained in anything.
602960	607920	And he, because he kept doing these jokes, he's like, all right, people. So you get into this chain
607920	612880	link, like, like, just, just, like, this chain link, like, cauldron. Because the, when the door's
612880	616800	open, then you're gonna get on the hay cart. Oh, it's gonna be so fun when you get on the hay cart.
616800	622160	So then you're, and then this guy, just, like, you know, peanut style, has his forearms over the
622160	628640	top of the chain link fence looking down at you. And he has a little baby bullhorn, because you're
628640	635680	not that far away. And he, and he goes, like, okay, people, oh, got a couple rules for you,
635680	642160	you're gonna have a good time, but you gotta follow these rules. Do not touch the actors.
643600	649760	I repeat, do not touch the actors. That goes for touching them. And then they would, like,
649760	654160	do some bit. And I don't even remember the bit. That's how unfunny. And nobody laughed. And I was
654160	661120	like, I think, like, do not stand when you're on the hay cart. Keep all of your arms and hands
661120	667200	down by your four-point landing. That, in other words, that is your gluteus maximus,
667200	672240	your butt, your sugar shaker, your flam-flam. I made it funnier than he did.
673760	678320	Like, he went, he tried to, like, his joke was that he was talking hip-hop or something.
680320	683360	So everyone's just, like, kind of bummed out. And they're like, yes, we got it. Like, these are,
683360	687440	those are not unimportant rules. We're glad you told them to us. Like, we're not, we're not,
687440	690080	we're not snarky. I thought I was with a group of enlightened people.
692480	695840	Like, like, like, like when nobody was causing trouble and nobody was, was he dressed spooky?
695840	699040	What was he dressed like? It was dressed like a, like a, like a, like a hillbilly. Like, like,
699040	702960	like, you know, they were all just a, it's a tractor driven, it's a tractor themed horror
702960	708560	experience. It's, it's, it's, I think you've all, you know, when you think of horror staples,
708560	713520	you think of farm equipment, like, like chainsaws, cut down trees. Who would have thought those could
713520	720560	be scary? Well, everybody, because they can cut people in half. But pitchforks, you know, who, who
720560	725680	would have thought that? Well, cause they stabbed people. Tractor rides, get in the tractor.
727040	734320	This tractor isn't haunted. It's just, it's taking a break between its normal tractor functions
735280	741680	while going through a haunted area. That's like, there's a tractor pulling me. It's like,
741680	746320	everything's nothing scary when you're being pulled by a tractor. So there's nothing scary.
746320	750720	Rosemary's baby. What if she had been on a tractor going through the movie? I was like, oh,
750720	754800	your baby's special. We want to, I think our neighbors are cultists, but we're on a tractor.
756400	766240	So who cares? Like Jaws. Oh God. There's a, this isn't, this isn't a boat, a boat accident.
766240	770880	Who, I don't know. If he tries to bite us, he'll probably break his teeth on the tractor.
772000	775120	We're on a tractor. You, you won't even need a bigger tractor. You won't.
776560	783680	Don't encourage him. It's, it's, it's my show. Encourage me. I've been away for a while. Encourage
783680	789840	me. So here's the only thing I can't believe you brought this up. I really remembered this and I,
789840	794000	like, so it was me and Dino and I was like, we're so we're like, yeah, yeah, we understand the rules.
794000	798320	So then this guy, like, so then there was like some hustle over here. Like there was some
798320	805440	business happening over here on the outside of the cage. And he's like, huh? Okay. You know,
805440	810480	Shelby, Shelby, Shelby, Shelby, because he realized, and I want you to remember that moment,
810480	817360	because he, at first he was going to do it loudly into his mini bullhorn. But, but, but what you'll
817360	823120	find in this story is that, is that the matter he needed to attend to demanded some respect and
823120	832960	privacy. So he's, Shelby, Shelby, we got it. We got a little handicap over here. No, I need,
832960	838880	I need, so we're gonna do a second round. Let's go 65. No, not 67. Cause it's two. We got it. We got
838880	847600	a little handicap situation. And I'm like, I go, okay, look not when he wants you to look now,
847600	854080	now that it's been all this time, look, and it's, well, what did I see? A human being in a wheelchair
854080	861840	who is having the scariest night of their life now. The night they feared since the moment,
861840	870240	whether it was birth or whatever ailed them, what happened? Which is the dumbest people in the world
870320	873360	swarming around them, calling them a little handicap.
875600	879360	And everyone being fine with it while they claw at chain link,
881280	891440	struggling for a view of the little handicap. I was fucking blown away. And I, I, you know,
891440	896160	and I did like, I, you know, I thought at that point I was like, well, we're certainly not in
896160	905360	the hands of people who care about our feelings. And that's scary. But they are very rule oriented.
905360	913680	So that undercuts it. You can't touch anybody. No one can touch you. Go to our website if you feel
913680	919040	touched. Get in the, get in the thing, get in the thing. And then everyone's like wearing
919040	924240	clown masks and like trying to do these bits that are based on like a different world where probably
924240	929040	it didn't have to be said constantly that no one could touch you. And it's like, and probably
929040	934640	there was like, I feel like over the years as epidemics of violence in our country, like
934640	940720	increased and the committees that run this thing changed around. I feel like I imagine that an
940720	945440	explanation of what I experienced that night, that the lights gradually got brighter and that
945440	950560	the actors gradually got more and more scolded for certain terms of phrase. And it just results
950560	956080	in just these people just like that are, that are just as dumb as someone who might be able to
956080	966400	scare you real good. Like nothing's scarier than a dumb fuck. Like with your money and suspenders
966400	970960	like fucking hanging out. Like in Charlie, have you ever been to a carnival ever in the last
970960	975840	38 years? That's terrifying. The last thing you see is like, all right, hold tight, keep your
975840	980640	shoes and he pulls his lever and you're like hearing these bolts that you know he doesn't
980640	986160	understand just creak and strain. And you're just remembering all of these articles and you're like,
986160	990800	we're trying to figure out if they're apocryphal. What are the rates? Where am I on this chart?
990800	995280	Why, why, why is there a rope across my belly? I've been on the Batman, right? I know what you're
995280	1004320	capable of. I know you're capable of making me safe. Why, why is everything so wooden that
1004400	1011840	when it rains, I've had decks. Do you check it every day? Everything's wood. Why is everything
1011840	1018160	wood? Like, so my point being, you could be scary just for nothing just by being a hick and hanging
1018160	1022560	out. So when the thing embarks. But they're all bound by this code. So they're just sort of like
1022560	1028000	doing this show. When the haywright kicks off and you leave the station and you're going out there,
1028000	1033120	are you just passively writing through a little tableau? Okay, so then you go, you all file in
1033120	1038000	and stand shoulder to shoulder. They keep yelling at you that you're not that as, that as close as
1038000	1043600	you feel you are, that you're not close enough to each other, but they can't touch you and you can't
1043600	1050880	touch them. But you know, welcome to fucking Jesus Christ. I'm so sorry. And like, like, like, like,
1050880	1054960	just imagine if you got on that thing with the wrong combination of people. I was like, thank
1054960	1061280	God for the wonderful people that were on there with me. Mike Nesmith, Terry Gar, Rick Schroeder,
1061840	1072880	um, uh, Norm McDonald, uh, Lil Wayne, uh, Stevie Nicks, um, two Baldwins, but one of them was the
1072880	1079120	sexist non-Baldwin. Um, did you know that guy's not a real Baldwin? I just found that out. Fake Baldwin?
1079120	1084240	Yeah, I lost my faith in the Baldwin name. He's not a Baldwin. He's some guy named Baldwin.
1085200	1092640	He's not a Baldwin. It should be against the law when you have a certain amount of
1092640	1098720	rename real estate in Hollywood. All right. So you leave the station and you're going down the
1098720	1102720	front. What's the first act of the haunted haywright? What's the first thing that you see
1102720	1106960	as you leave chain link fence? What happened with the handicap situation?
1108320	1112720	They just, they just had to take the next cart and I'm sure they were tended to very sensitively and
1114640	1117840	I'm sure if you go to their blog, you'll find that they love Halloween now.
1120400	1124800	So it's, it's, it's Griffith park. It's by the zoo in the golf course there. It's night time
1125360	1131120	and you leave. Just give me a moment. You're now that poor, poor little handicap.
1132320	1138240	He called her a little, he referred to a human being. I think what he meant to say is a little
1138240	1146400	handicap situation. If he had just said situation, I would chuckle, but then because of his concern
1146400	1151680	about it and stuff, it'd be like, oh, that's colloquial and we are too PC. Like he's expressing
1151680	1156320	a need and we have a little handicap situation. That's a, that could be something a hero says,
1156320	1162640	but he just, he left the word out. So he, he, he, he reduced someone's humanity.
1162640	1168160	Who is that? Like, like, just, like, they just, they, they, if, if you know,
1168160	1172800	I had to be talked into going there that night. Jesus Christ. What about me in a wheelchair?
1174160	1178960	What do you, I'd never go. So that means somebody fucking cajoled that person.
1179680	1182240	They were like, please handicap Harmon, please.
1184880	1189440	You're so, you're such a curmudgeon. You're such a loner. You say you're, it's unhealthy. Please
1189440	1192800	come out. Just once I swear to God, I promise, promise, promise, promise you're going to have
1192800	1199040	a good time. Now somebody, we got a little handicap here. I want to kill myself. And it's
1199040	1206400	depending on my situation. I may not be able to. I'm going to put it into my book. I'm going to
1206400	1211120	write it with my foot and I'm going to fucking die a spiritual death. And I'm going to be hanging
1211120	1216320	out as a flesh husk haunting you. That's going to like, do you think these ghosts scare me?
1218720	1224080	You people are the monsters because you think I'm a ghost.
1227600	1234720	So the, you get, so you get on the thing and then, and then there comes this point and this is,
1234720	1239840	this is on me. This is my fault. The rest of the evening is my fault because then they go,
1239920	1243280	I'm so nervous now. I'm like, I don't have to, they keep saying that I'm not
1243280	1247200	close enough to people. I feel like, I feel like they're right. If somebody tells me that I'm
1247200	1251440	doing something wrong, I'm going to first assume they're right. And then it's, I'm like,
1252000	1256480	so close to people. And then they're like, now sit. And it was like, everyone was like,
1256480	1261280	thump into this like land of lakes, like fucking lotus position. And I was like,
1261280	1267440	I gotta play this smart cause I'm 42. And I, I kind of like, I tried, I just, I tried,
1267440	1270960	I overthought it. And I was like, I was like, well, I'm certainly not going to,
1270960	1275680	but then again, what if my foot, and then I say, well, sometimes on the couch I put a, well,
1275680	1279840	you know, after a long day, but then my shoes would be off normally. And I, and I was like,
1279840	1284320	well, that's going to, I'll be asked if I, but if I have to move and I just ended up in a fucking
1284320	1290640	weird, like, like, like, like breakdancing pose, like just, and everyone kept asking me,
1290640	1298400	are you okay? For real. Every time I moved a muscle, like one of three, like, like, like
1298400	1303280	women my age, like not, it wasn't like a high school experience. It was like women my age,
1303280	1309440	like, like, like they out of courtesy and respect for my humanity, they would feel spasms happening
1309440	1314800	and would look over at me and go like, you okay? And I'm like, yeah, I just, I'm gone. And I was
1314800	1318560	like, this is like, hey, you're slippery. And I'm like, I'm like, I just try to, but you're the,
1318560	1323760	one of the rules is you can't get up. If you get up, you will be ejected from the ride.
1326080	1328320	You know, you should have said, you should have said at some point,
1328320	1331280	you should have raised your hand and said, excuse me, I have a little handicap situation.
1334480	1340400	I am a little handicap and I would like to be ejected for the, from the ride for the duration
1340400	1345360	necessary to properly fold my legs underneath. Can you, can you not sit cross-legged or is it,
1345360	1350400	you just panicked? I try right now. Try to sit cross-legged. This is TV dynamite.
1352640	1357760	Out of curiosity, I'm asking, do you know whether or not you can sit cross-legged?
1357760	1360240	All right. And then promise me we'll bring Andy up. Oh yeah.
1361040	1364880	Just stop. Stop. I mean, it's, it's Jeff's fault. Andy hasn't been brought up.
1368560	1369200	Okay, here we go.
1376000	1384000	Our next guest has performed at clubs and colleges
1385760	1391280	all around the world. He's a Harman town favorite. He's a Dan Harmon favorite. He's a,
1391280	1395520	he's a Jeff Davis favorite. It's not a competition.
1397120	1400240	But I, I spell my favorite with the O U R.
1400240	1405680	All right. Well, let's bring them out. Andy Kindler's here.
1421920	1422640	What an entrance.
1422640	1428320	I think they prefer it if you're there.
1431680	1439120	All right. I'm a Jeff Davis aficionado. I came up with that back there. All right.
1440560	1444160	I'm always thinking. When I like, because Andy, when I think, when I think of you,
1444160	1450160	Andy, I think of a showman. Yes. You entered from, you enter from the back of the room,
1450160	1457040	left stage left, then re-entered stage left. PT, PT Junim.
1459680	1463760	That's a PT Barnum reference. If you're Jewish. Oh, oh great. Oh great.
1465680	1470160	I am a showman. I put it on the show. That's what I do. I do good. I got it. Cause I'm out.
1470160	1474560	I'm tapped. I fucking liked it. You know, you were on, no, you weren't fired. Well,
1474560	1478960	yeah, this was, well, I consider fire. You were boom into, first of all, you, you have,
1479040	1483440	you went on the hay ride and most people would not do that for an anecdote. Now I know that if
1483440	1487840	you had told me that if you had been at the dinner that I was at with Dino, if you had just popped
1487840	1494560	out from, from the kitchen and said, most people don't do what you're about to do. Yeah. I thought,
1494560	1501920	Dino, cause he's going on it twice. It sounds like a, like a Hee Haw convention. I don't know.
1502480	1508640	Hee Haw sounded good. Convention was wrong. Andy, you've not done it, correct?
1508640	1513920	Oh, have I done it? I grew up on a farm with hay. No, I didn't. I've never been,
1515760	1522560	how did, how did they start with the hay rides? Why are they riding hay around?
1523600	1528800	Keep the hay by the barn. It's kind of like Seinfeld. Every time, every time you put it in
1528800	1533760	the cart, you're going to get haunted. Right. Where are you taking it? Is there another farm?
1533760	1539760	Let them grow their own hay. Hey, the word haunted is in your ride. Who wants to go on a
1539760	1545440	haunted ride? I don't know what a barn's capable of, but I know it has its own hay. Now, who am I?
1546880	1554000	I turned into yogurt from Spaceballs. From Spaceballs? Yeah. I'll tell you about it. I've never,
1554000	1558160	you know, I saw that movie coming. I was like, no way I'm going to go there. I didn't, I begged
1558160	1563360	all of my friends to go see it. I was at prime. You were the Dino to that haunted hay ride. Yeah.
1563680	1567440	So the weirdest thing about the haunted hay ride, stop me if you want to talk about anything else,
1567440	1572480	but here's the, here's the, here's the weirdest thing. Like I had so many questions, like they,
1572480	1576960	because they never, there's no, I mean, and I'm not being a snob because they would just take you
1576960	1581520	through scary stuff. It was just sort of like you'd sometimes you'd stop and there'd be like,
1581520	1585680	they'd put on a little show. I was like, well, who's going to complain about this? This is not
1585680	1589600	a problem. But then it was like, for the most part, it's just people wandering up and they just keep,
1589600	1593440	you know, and you just keep remembering, they're not allowed to touch you. You should not touch
1593440	1600080	them. So it's sort of like, it really like takes the fear out of like the 90th guy coming up and
1600080	1605120	just putting his head next to yours and going, and I'm like, but now I'm, my anxiety, I'm like,
1606080	1611600	but it's fake. I'm faking it. Because it's like when you tip at a strip strip bar.
1611600	1614800	Yeah. I'm like, I don't know. The last one was a redhead, but that's on me.
1615120	1620960	Like, I don't know. I don't want to take it out on you. Like, like, like, I don't know what my job
1620960	1626880	is anymore. What is currency? A strip bar, strip bar. Hey, right. Am I wrong?
1628080	1634160	Am I wrong? So it's all magical. Like there are goblins and there were people,
1634160	1638560	but the lighting was bad, but in the wrong ways. So like, what was that word?
1639920	1643760	Well, it was like, they weren't lit. So I couldn't like see their faces, but everything was lit for
1643760	1648240	everyone's safety. Like everything was lit so that the driver could see the road and so that
1648240	1652800	no one could sue them for ever not seeing something, but it wasn't lit. There were no key
1652800	1656720	lights, you know, and there were, there was no blocking. So all you were ever seeing was just
1656720	1661600	like shiny mess. Like when you, when you took the old, uh, universal studios tour ride, you would
1661600	1665600	go into a thing and it would stop and it would stop you in front of the place and they would
1665600	1668960	tell you about the history of the thing. And then the flood would happen. Like you remember that?
1668960	1674160	That is the worst. That is the worst tour. And I've been on it four times. And the last time I
1674160	1679840	went on it, it was, uh, I was doing a gig up at a private party and the only way to get to it was
1679840	1689600	I had to go through the tour to the fourth time and it's horrible. The door is horrible. The jaws
1689600	1697840	chark. The fire allows that that there's only one point of, no, that was your way to get into the
1697840	1702240	party. If you have to leave, everyone gets to just go around the ride. I don't, I don't know.
1702240	1710480	I didn't realize you. I felt, I didn't see any way around it. I think this guy loves jaws.
1710480	1714560	Terrible tour. The worst part is the Moses part where they part the seat, but they don't part the
1714560	1718880	seat. The seat just sinks into a thing. Oh, I don't even want to get it. I don't even want to
1718880	1726960	get into the how it ruins the illusion of all these movies. Now I know there wasn't a real
1726960	1736000	shark. I was a kid when they, when they, when they implemented the King Kong attraction at
1736000	1741520	the universal studios tour ride. Jeff is 720 years old. Implement it. I like implement it.
1742320	1748320	Have you implemented the new ride yet? Also, he's a cone head. He eats toilet paper.
1748320	1752240	We would like to be implemented into the new ride. We are from, we are from France.
1755440	1760000	You're going to get your balls busted tonight. Oh, you're going now, baby. You're going to get
1760000	1768880	kindled 2015, 2015 hashtag, um, patent, patent pending. But where the King Kong ride came out,
1768880	1773200	they boasted. And it was true when you went in and King Kong is shaking the cables of the Brooklyn
1773200	1779840	bridge that you are ostensibly on as advertised. And your car is your tram. The world's clunkiest
1779840	1784800	most accurate slogan for a ride over. And, but when King Kong was bright close to you,
1784800	1792480	when you got right up in front of it, uh, banana scented breath. Oh, no, you dad. Oh my God.
1793200	1799200	No detail was left on ruined. It's like they thought of nothing. But I bet they had to point
1799200	1803760	it out. Right. There was probably a sign that the cool part, Andy, and you tell your friends.
1804720	1809440	I will back you up on your old school enough. And I know that you are because you have OG
1809440	1818720	written all across your, your, I have OC, OC, you have OCD, your OCG, OCG. Come on. Initial
1818720	1824960	humor is easy. Come on. Come up with something. Oh, you're not, you're a Cesar compulsive gangster.
1824960	1831440	So, uh, uh, we, you know, I've shot so many motherfuckers at 73 to be exact,
1831440	1836800	unless you count, uh, Stacy, because he was already, uh, dying when my friend shot him.
1836800	1841360	But, um, I go by, um, actual time of death. I was the motherfucker.
1842640	1846240	I was supposed to make sure he was dead. Now I'm concerned he was not really dead.
1848800	1854720	You don't own me, motherfucker. You're not a box of matchsticks spilled out onto an open
1854720	1859040	white shag carpet. Now I keep checking for my keys.
1862800	1868480	Yo. Come on. A comedy staple, ladies and gentlemen. White people rapping.
1868480	1880720	Yeah. Yo. OCGs. Yeah. I put my bullets in the clip. I put the left one first as I'm facing it.
1880720	1886560	I got my bullets arranged from left to right because I'm going to shoot you with the sharpest
1886560	1892640	bullet tonight, but I got to make sure that the sharpest ones, I touch it three times.
1892640	1896480	Otherwise my mother might die.
1898800	1903200	I'm getting a pain in my heart. Is it a panic attack or have I been shot?
1905200	1906080	I can't be sure.
1908960	1913440	Did I leave the, did I leave the pilot light at home? On.
1916000	1920240	Yo, man, I'm so fucking angry right now at the world,
1920320	1926240	but my therapist tells me to start trying to stop worrying about it. You try stopping worrying
1926240	1930480	about something. What do you think happens, motherfucker? You worry more.
1937920	1944720	I forgot to put the cap back on the bottle. I forgot to put a cap on your ass.
1945440	1951920	I bust the cap back onto the bottle. It doesn't go flats afterwards.
1953280	1958000	See what I ruined? If I had, if I had fucking loosened my goddamn grip on my show.
1958000	1960080	This is all I think rap is somehow.
1964480	1968640	You're halfway home. If you do that, the rest is just writing in genius.
1968640	1970960	That's right. The rest is just talent.
1971920	1974880	It seems to help to grow up as part of a disenfranchised population,
1974880	1977760	but people are speculating that that's a total coincidence.
1977760	1983520	I was a reformed Jew around a lot of conservative Jews. You think that was easy?
1983520	1984000	No.
1986640	1988400	Think I didn't suffer in Queens?
1990320	1994240	I wanted to be upper middle class, but I was just regular middle class.
1994240	2001200	Why can't we have a better car, daddy?
2004160	2008320	Yo, yeah, I had a support system, but at what price?
2016160	2020560	So one thing, one atonal thing about the Haunted A-Ride was
2020560	2030480	because after a whole unexplained, and it wasn't necessary to explain any of this.
2030480	2035440	I didn't, I required nothing. You guys think, oh, Dan, humble brag or whatever.
2035440	2039040	You're like, oh, you went on a Haunted A-Ride and it had third act problems.
2039040	2042240	You're trying to flaunt like, oh, oh, you're a craftsman.
2042240	2046560	You're trying to brand yourself like, well, when I see a dog shit on a carpet,
2046560	2051760	I just see poop on a carpet, but you see, ooh, network by Patty Chayefsky,
2051760	2055600	because you're so interesting. That's not what I'm trying to create.
2056480	2059840	I'm saying like, that's exactly what they were thinking. How did you know that?
2061600	2068480	I only wanted to just, as one of you, just wanted to be in a hay cart and be haunted.
2068480	2072240	That's all I was looking for. I had no other requirements.
2072800	2076800	However, the way they haunted me for as long as they did.
2078560	2080000	And continues to haunt you.
2080960	2085200	Well, the thing that continues to haunt me was the total disruption and tonality.
2085200	2089360	That was like, because right in the middle of the whole thing,
2089360	2095520	and yeah, so the whole thing is just like bat people, goblin people, bucket people,
2095520	2101520	tree people, do chain people, Viking people. It's just random. It's just like,
2101520	2106880	I think what they must do is they like must sublet each 10 feet of the park to like some
2106880	2113440	bad improv trip. Or just like a committee. They just go like, okay, Gary and his guys,
2113440	2117040	they said they'd come back, but they really want to do the Vikings again.
2118320	2122160	How many times do I have to tell them Vikings haven't been scary since 1203?
2123920	2126000	Even the Minnesota Vikings, am I right?
2126000	2130720	Oh, go Packers.
2134480	2140160	Right. Not, not soon or late enough.
2142320	2147920	So in the middle of it, after all anyone's done has gone, it's all anyone keeps doing.
2149520	2152960	So then you pull, and all of a sudden you start hearing like sixties Motown music
2152960	2160000	and you're like, where's this going? How, how racist is this going to get? Because I
2160000	2165760	just went through the witch doctor segment, by the way. Right. And I, and I, and I'm a,
2165760	2169600	I'm a white liberal and I won't write a letter, but I'm holding on to it.
2172000	2177920	But it, but, but, but, but, but, but they seemed fine with it. And by they, you know who I mean.
2177920	2182400	The goblins, the goblins.
2182400	2186640	And I subscribed to the social philosophy that if it's fine with them, it is fine with me.
2187520	2192000	But believe me, it's still down there. I'm thinking about it. What was the Motown song?
2192000	2198160	I don't remember. It was like, don't mess with me. I want to kiss your lips. Cause my sugar baby
2198160	2204160	loves to kiss your lips. I don't think, I don't think either one of those is Motown. Who's with
2204880	2215520	me on this? The Archie's is not Motown. And then, and then what comes into view is like a cross
2215520	2222000	section of Cornfield and then like this, like this like vintage sixties car. I'm like, okay,
2222000	2226240	I guess this is here. It doesn't fit with anything. And then like two kids came out
2226240	2231360	dressed in like, like back to the future to like kind of like fifties attire, like they're like
2231360	2237760	sweaters and the ponytails. And I didn't get turned on, but it was like, I didn't, and I
2237760	2242480	didn't say that I didn't because I did. I like why, who reacts to getting turned on that way?
2244400	2250320	It's not part of the story. That movie made me so horny. Am I right? Back to the future.
2251200	2254000	So the two kids, and then they go, and then they're like performing. But by the way,
2254000	2257920	everyone that's performing, like half of the audience is going like this. And every time I
2257920	2264160	do that, my neck is behind my leg and people are going, are you okay? So I'm trying to strain.
2264160	2267920	So it's two actors that go out. These are the first people that have spoken any
2267920	2274000	language except for like rattling cans and going, ah, and shooting chains into nothing
2274880	2279040	for the whole time. So now all of a sudden it's halfway through the thing. And, and, and there's
2279040	2283840	just like two actors come out and they go like, ah, stop it. What are you doing? Yeah. What are
2283840	2291280	you doing? Hey, whoa, it's my heart, baby. Oh, come on. Hey, whoa, what's that? And they look,
2291280	2296160	and so we all look and there's like some like kind of awkwardly lit thing that like, I kept going
2296160	2301040	like, well, if that's going to be a guy that kills you, I want to watch that because when I'm really,
2301040	2306160	that's not going to move, is it? It's going to stay there. So like, that's going to be interesting.
2306160	2310080	So I was looking at that. But then what happened is they got into the car because they were scared
2310080	2316400	of that, which turns out they, they, there was gunshots from the car. So this is like not that
2316400	2320560	kind of like show so far. It was like, I think this is the most expensive things that they had
2320560	2324560	to keep it even though there's been, you know, so much, because I talked to other people like that,
2324560	2328640	right. It's so scary. It's like it had this whole theme of serial killers last time. Because this
2328640	2335440	was clearly just a fucking just cold blooded recreation of the fucking Zodiac killings.
2336240	2341440	Like it was just they got into the car. And then there was like strobe lights and gunshots from
2341440	2347280	inside the car. So we've been like being like, like, like delightfully harangued by goblins
2348240	2353280	that cannot touch you. And then there's this play and it culminates and just like, bang,
2353280	2359280	bang, bang, bang. And then and then the weirder part is how dumb it is because the guy a guy
2359280	2369760	gets out in a ski mask, holding an axe even though he's I guess he doesn't he's not confident
2369760	2375280	in his marksmanship or he's like, or he or he just ran out of bullets. But he's like, he's like now
2375280	2379600	holding an axe. So he climbs out and he goes, maybe he maybe he killed a gun with his axe.
2379600	2388880	Right. Right. Well, then the other actors should come back. We're fine. There was an axe in the
2388880	2397040	backseat. This gentleman was skiing. He hates the Second Amendment. But he comes out and he walks
2397040	2403280	along the hay cart. But the weird thing is everyone else has been a goblin, a troll, a new
2403280	2411200	can't take your director's hat off. That's the problem. I'm a writer. The you're like,
2411200	2416560	the lighting is wrong. It's just no, it's just structural. It's just because he said he goes like,
2416560	2421040	oh, hey, it's supposed to be funny and bone chilling. Now, this was Thursday night. All
2421040	2426400	these people are phoning it in. But he was like, like, my nobody's bones were close to chilled.
2426400	2430640	Like, like, like they were everyone's homes were room temperature. How many how many spines were
2430640	2435520	tangled? No, no, no, no tingling. Like, like, like, there was a couple aches and bakes. Oh,
2435520	2443360	you'll have aches and bakes. You have to go. You have to come back to save a lot of money
2443360	2447840	just staying home and watching like a Jonestown documentary. So then he just keeps going. And I
2447840	2451360	swear to God, I'm done talking about the fucking hayride. But he goes like he follows the hayride
2451360	2455760	for a while. And I cannot stress to you enough. No one has spoken to us the entire time. And it's
2455760	2459840	not the end. And it's not the beginning. This is just the middle and it will never be addressed
2459840	2465280	again structurally. It's just like, it's just this fucking insane temporal shift. We're like,
2465280	2469680	we were at a witch's house, we were in gumdrop land, we were in fucking Pink Floyd's the wall.
2469680	2473600	Now we're just in the fucking 60s and an actual historical murder.
2477040	2482240	Some people are could possibly be relatives of some victims. That's not my point. I'm just saying
2482240	2488000	it's totally different. It's totally different. If the whole hayride was like, Oh, I know that
2488000	2491520	house. That's John Wayne Gacy's house. Look in the crawl space. There's a strobe light.
2491520	2496240	A kid's trying to get out. Whoa, that's fucked up. That really happened, yo. Let's go eat pizza.
2498000	2502080	But it was nothing like that. It was like paper mache lollipop people going like,
2504960	2508320	and then all of a sudden he's like, Hey, Dwayne, I don't know if we should be out.
2509040	2512880	When should we tell my parents I'm pregnant? Hey, don't worry about your baby. I'll take
2512880	2516720	great care of it. We'll love it forever. Oh my God, he's got a gun. Please don't. I want to die.
2516720	2520000	I don't want to fucking die. Oh my God, this happened 45 times this year.
2522880	2527280	And the guy comes out and does this like bad fucking improv performance with a ski mask and
2527280	2534080	a hatchet going like, Oh, hey, hey, you guys. And he's decided all serial killers are from New Jersey.
2535280	2538800	Oh, hey, hey, you didn't happen to see anything back there. Did you?
2538800	2546800	And everyone, no one says anything because you can't. That's called social engineering, Dan.
2547440	2551760	Oh, you didn't, you didn't have to see anything. Did you? And because it says it in his script,
2551760	2555840	like, even though everyone's just going like this, he keeps like singling out people going,
2555840	2561520	what about you, ma'am? Did you, you look like you saw something. And she's like, no, I didn't.
2561520	2569040	Wait, what, what do you, what do you think happens when someone goes,
2569680	2575280	I saw it. It was fucking you. Put, put the axe down. I mean, obviously that character
2575280	2579840	knew we saw something. He just shot two people and he was speaking very rhetorically. Honestly,
2579840	2584080	what do you think happens if you say you did it? We just watched you. Well, here's some things on
2584080	2591040	the list of that won't happen because that's easier. He won't touch you and you won't stand
2591040	2596400	up. You won't touch the wire above your head. Uh, the tractor will keep going. And I mean,
2596400	2600000	what do you think the whole, that's so confusing. It was like, why did they personalize it for that
2600000	2605200	one moment? Because I was like, listen, as unattractive as this idea is, like the truth
2605200	2609280	is if we were truly in a realm where we've seen all the shit that we've seen tonight,
2609280	2612240	this guy is the closest ally we have. He has a gun.
2612240	2620960	Like we're obviously traveling through dimensions. We don't know his story.
2621920	2626160	Maybe we're going to find, maybe we would judge him and we find out, oh, those two people killed
2626160	2630560	his parents or something in the sixties. Like I don't, we don't know. Maybe he was framed.
2630560	2634800	The whole thing happened to the dark was so much. I was just like, it wasn't scary is my point.
2636640	2641280	It wasn't scary. I'm 42. I want to go on a children's ride and be scared.
2642960	2653120	I also have complaints about Spiderman nine. I'm 49 years old. I deserve better in my Spiderman movie.
2655920	2660320	All right. I just heard myself. It took me 50 minutes, but I'm ready to grow up.
2661760	2669520	I think a valuable lesson, don't applaud me saying I'm a good ride. And that's one to grow on a
2669520	2673680	beginning, a middle, and an end. That's the problem with that. It was all over the map.
2673680	2678000	No, I went to not, not scary for him, which we talked about night. Don't bring it up.
2678000	2682800	I grew up in, uh, in Southern California. There's not very firm and in Halloween,
2682800	2689680	there is not scary for, I love puns in any format, but even when they completely undercut the,
2689680	2694960	yes, the desired message, not scary for, but actually that that's how I actually,
2694960	2698960	only when Dino and Dan pointed out, I never thought of it being not scary for him.
2698960	2704400	I never thought of that. That's literally what, like phonetically, that's what it is.
2704400	2707920	I grew, I grew up at Knott's Berry Farm. They added the word scary. I didn't,
2708960	2715040	you just, they had the word scary for Halloween, right? Yeah. It's not all year, all year round.
2715040	2723360	But, uh, did I step on you love not scary farm in June? I don't know what I said. I retract that.
2723360	2727120	I retract that. What if they, what if they found that out there? Like gentlemen,
2727120	2732720	the not scary brand is actually catching like wildfire in a way that Knott's Berry's never did.
2732720	2737360	People like not scary things. Right. They don't like jelly. We found out.
2738240	2744080	My pitch was that they should call it, uh, for Halloween, not N O T, not scary farm,
2744080	2748320	comma, not, but spelled K N O T T, apostrophe. Yes.
2748320	2751440	There's layers there that you guys will have to Google. There's a movie.
2751440	2762000	Not scary. Not scary. So when I went to not scary farm, uh, there would be,
2762000	2765920	there'd be fist fights all the time because they were absolutely allowed to touch you.
2765920	2770240	The people that played the ghouls and the boogens there, they would just jump out of a,
2770800	2777680	they would, they would just, there was boogens and googas. Oh, they were really,
2777680	2780400	it was not that thick then. She's just kidding shit for me.
2780400	2785840	Spencer, Spencer, boogens is a real mythological character. I think people say boogens.
2785840	2788400	Boogens? Yeah. I call them the boogens.
2790320	2796880	Look, boogens, it's like Dan was bagel. I, he only read it. So when we went there,
2796880	2801200	they would jump out and grab you from behind and scare the ever loving shit out of you,
2801200	2806160	which isn't really being like scared. It's just being startled. Exactly. Millennials.
2808240	2813360	So I was going through a haunted house with Diana Mattawossian. I think we're sophomores
2813360	2816800	in high school. We'll start in high school. We go to Knott's Berry Farm, not scary farm.
2816800	2820960	And I, we're going through, and I had a big crush on Diana Mattawossian who is still,
2822720	2830640	Oh, yeah. She's right. Oh, she knows. She knows what she's doing. I was,
2832000	2836080	I was a late bloomer. I was so afraid of girls. I was so afraid. So I had her by the hand. We're
2836080	2841280	going through it. Like when this little tunnel driven haunted houses, things where people just
2841280	2844800	jump out at you and stuff. And so, you know, I'm going to walk through that little corridor there
2844800	2850480	and it's going to be a bunch of boogens jumping out at me. So I have her by the hand and I'm
2850480	2854960	leaving her down the hallway and I'm pulling her and she's too afraid. There's boogens jumping out
2854960	2860480	at her. And I'm like, Diana, just run. Just come like this. Like, we'll just, we'll just go past
2860560	2867520	this thing. And my hand goes slack and I look and I go, Hey, and I say, Hey, and she had butts me.
2869600	2872240	That tooth, if you get a closeup, that tooth right there sticks out.
2873440	2878880	Oh, it's got a little piece of hair and tissue on it. And that's why you say boogens. That's
2878880	2884800	why you say that Mattawossian, Mattawossian. This isn't, I'm haunted by the ghost of an Armenian
2884800	2891760	head. I would like to. She wasn't hurt at all, by the way. She moved my tooth up into my brain.
2893280	2904080	That's a racist stereotype. Armenian skulls are just as soft as. Not in my experience, Dan.
2904080	2908400	Not in my experience. Well, you met a weird woman, not an Armenian spokesmodel.
2908400	2914560	Oh, I apologies to my friends. Rick, Rick, Rick Toussounian, Rick Toussounian.
2919600	2923760	That's the first time you care about an actually good name. Rick Toussounian.
2924320	2928640	All right. Well, Andy, what were you going to say? Come on. Oh, no. I was going to say,
2928640	2934240	if we did a survey, if we did like a survey, I would say the very few Jews would go to these
2934320	2942000	haunted house things. If I wanted, I just would take mushrooms on Halloween or something. If I
2942000	2946160	want to have a terrible experience. What would it be like if... Terrible, horrible. Andy, Andy,
2946160	2952080	say a couple Jews went to not scary for everyone. How would that go? Well, they would be like, oh,
2954400	2963360	do you think this is good for our eyes? I gave my mother one of those 3D books and she looked at it
2963440	2970400	like, you think this is good for your eyes? Yeah, yeah, mom. That's why everyone's required to
2970400	2974720	have one at birth by the American Medical Association. It's good for your eyes.
2974720	2977680	Good for your eyes. No, we would never. There's no chance that Jews would go.
2977680	2980080	Is anybody else's spine tingling? My spine's been tingling.
2986400	2990480	I remember going through a haunted house with my brother, my older brother who...
2991120	2991760	Name of bones.
2994640	2997520	I went through a haunted house with him and then there was like, I was scared and there was like,
2997520	3002000	I remember this chain link area. It's not chain link, but it was like kind of like mall,
3002000	3005840	you know, at the mall where they lower the things. There was like room to reach through.
3005840	3009600	And that was their whole point was that there was like a whole chamber of zombies strobe lit
3009600	3011920	and they were reaching through the thing and they were grabbing you.
3012960	3017040	This was the 80s. This was the 80s. If you weren't getting grabbed,
3017600	3022480	you weren't grabbing back, then David Hasselhoff wasn't there.
3027360	3032240	So I got scared. I was like a 10 year old kid. I feel like all my memories are from 10,
3032240	3036800	but I was like, I was like, I got up scared, but it was like scared. Like, I don't know,
3036800	3041120	they're grabbing me and it was scary. And then I just remember like running away,
3041120	3045760	like down this hall with all these hands reaching through and this strobe light.
3045760	3050800	And then like looking back, cause I forgot my brother, my big brother is five years older than
3050800	3057760	me. And I look back and just see this strobe lit image of my, my big brother going motherfucker,
3057760	3064560	don't you fucking touch my little brother. And he's like, and he's like kicking the fucking like,
3066080	3071120	and all the zombies are now strobe lit, but totally fucking, they're all like,
3071760	3077280	just uncomfortable. Like Albert Brooks characters just going like, like, okay,
3078880	3083120	this happens three times a week. We got another one. And he's just like motherfucker, don't fuck,
3083120	3088400	don't fuck. And I was like the fucking swirl of emotions I had. Cause he was like, Oh,
3088400	3093920	that's nice. He's not, he's not beating me up. He's like, he wants to, he wants to beat other
3093920	3098800	people. Beating up is just his way of saying things. Right. When he's beating me up, he's saying
3099440	3109440	you now he's, now he's noticing them for me. Yeah. I think that every time he's fighting
3109440	3114560	somebody, he's fighting the boogens within himself. I want to, I want to tell it not because I owe it
3114560	3117600	to my brother because he wasn't, he won't talk to me anymore. Cause I talked to him, talked about
3117600	3122240	him on the podcast, but in the interest of, of karma, I do want to tell it just the other,
3122800	3127600	the other version of that story, which is that, um, uh, it never happened. I was a drug dealer
3127600	3134000	and I don't have a brother. No, they, uh, the, I was, I was like, I was in a movie theater. I think
3134000	3137200	we were going to see, I don't know what movie we were going to see, but it was me, my brother,
3137200	3142320	and a mutual friend of ours. And I was like, I, I just was like, you know, I'll probably
3142320	3147840	blow your mind. But when I was 14, I was like, I had trouble like watching my mouth and like
3147840	3152800	not getting into a bunch of fucking trouble socially. Uh, I know, I don't, I don't want you
3152800	3159280	guys to unfollow me now that you know that about me. Um, but I had no fucking like filter and I was
3159280	3163040	just like, like, I don't know when I, especially when I'm on a high, I was just like, like fraternity
3163040	3168160	and like, like I, I, like I just, I started, we were in a nearly empty theater and then I was just
3168160	3173200	like talking like really loud to my two friends. One of them was my brother going like, like,
3173200	3177520	man, you guys, you guys ever go to a theater and there's just somebody sitting there alone.
3177520	3181360	Like who does that? I could never see myself doing that. I don't know. Like, like, like,
3181360	3184560	that's what's crazy. Like I was really just expressing, it was just sort of like, I was just,
3184560	3187760	I would have talked about anything. I was just feeling like camaraderie and I was just like,
3187760	3191200	like, isn't that weird? Everything's weird when you're 14. I'm like, oh, there's something I
3191200	3194240	noticed. Oh, I'm an expert at going to movies. Well, what's that with that guy who always goes
3194240	3197920	there alone? You see guy alone, like, who does that? Who does that? I'm just like fucking,
3197920	3209200	and then my, my, my brother's friend goes like, and I go, and there's the only other guy in the,
3209200	3215120	like, like, well, it's like half a dozen people. One guy is alone. He's like a Milwaukee archetype.
3215120	3222240	He's got a mullet and, and he looks like he's been lifting weights to compensate for a lot of
3222240	3229440	shit that he's like, like, like, he's looks like scary. Like, like, and, and, and, and I, because
3229440	3235520	when I turn and look at him, I got, he's like staring at me and I go, I go like, sorry, yeah,
3235520	3241040	not you. Sorry. This is exactly what I do. And only then at that point does the guy go,
3241040	3249280	what'd you say, motherfuckers? The fuck did you say to me? And he gets up. This is every human
3249280	3254080	being's worst nightmare in a movie theater. And it's happening to me. It's one of my first
3254080	3261040	movie theater experiences, which is why I will not save your seat. Let's just go to a different movie
3261920	3267840	or watch it without popcorn. It's making me very nervous or go to that, go to that place in
3267840	3274880	Pasadena where you buy the seat. You reserve them. Um, but he, and he goes like, what'd you say,
3274880	3280800	motherfucker? Oh, fuck it. And he starts walking down the aisle and he's coming to me. And my
3280800	3288160	brother, my crazy self destructive, like, like, like, like, you know, source of a million woes.
3288640	3294960	Not listening any longer to the podcast. No, no, he's not. No, not tuned into my life. I have a
3294960	3300800	niece who is, uh, I think the first chair violinist in the LA for helpful harmonic. I have no idea.
3302720	3309600	She's 38 and I have never met her. Um, but, um, the, the, the, you don't, you don't like
3309600	3315440	classical music that much. I aged, I aged a woman. Uh, I've been doing this podcast for
3316400	3321840	anyways. So as he, as he gets started, I'm like, well, I guess this is just one of those scenes
3321840	3327040	you see, like, like where like you'd see a guy go, I don't know what to do. But, and my brother
3327040	3332160	just goes, sit the fuck down. Whoa. And the guy's like, what? And the brother is like, you heard me,
3332160	3336160	you fucking fake ass muscle man. Take your fake ass back to the seat and sit it down and watch
3336160	3340720	the fucking movie or get the fuck out of here before I crush you. That's my hero. That's what
3340800	3346240	I always think of. And the fucking guy just went like, like, yeah, we'll see. And like,
3346240	3354080	walk back and sat down and watch the movie. And I have no idea what the movie was or what
3354080	3361040	it was about. It could have been dead poet society. It was Billy Jack. I was like, holy shit.
3362160	3367520	If it was Billy Jack, that'd be great. Wouldn't it be great? What was the film down? Any idea? No
3367520	3373200	idea. Because all the film was my brother stuck up for me and saved my life. And I for once I was
3373200	3379200	like the bad guy and the idiot and he was the genius. He was fucking like he knew all the moves
3379200	3383840	and like protected me and like did everything right. And no blood was shed. Like because he
3383840	3390480	knew what to do and didn't even give it a second thought. For all of your brother's misdeeds,
3390480	3395040	that one story is enough to secure his legacy in your heart, right? That's a good moment.
3395680	3402800	You're prodding me to tell you nine funny my brother stories. No, no, no. I've heard all your
3403440	3407520	brothers stories. No, my brother was never here. Andy, do you have siblings, brothers, sisters?
3408080	3417360	My brother is, I'm the youngest and I'm adorable. And I have an older sister and an older brother.
3417360	3422880	And my brother is, was too big to hurt me. And like he could beat me up, so he never did.
3422880	3429280	Like how many years is that? Two years, two years. Very tiny man, very tiny man.
3430880	3435200	That lands as a joke that nobody laughed at and it's true. What's that? Because you're like,
3435200	3441600	oh, my big brother, he was just so much bigger than me. He didn't hurt me because it would have
3441600	3445920	been how many years between? Two years. Yeah. That's funny to me because my brother was five
3445920	3450880	years older than me and it was like, that is the recipe. Yeah. Even if he was a month older than
3450880	3454480	me, it would have been trouble. Was your brother like a big hulking figure? No, but at the time,
3454480	3460400	well, I was four 11 until like high school. And then I, uh, well don't, it's not that much of a
3460400	3467600	tragedy. Oh my God. How does he even live? Did someone marry him? If he remained that tiny,
3467600	3472960	what would he have done? He would have maybe played, he would, he would have got a job as
3472960	3480800	a platform that people could walk over or something. That guy sprung up to five, five and
3480800	3486800	a half. Thank God. Thank God. What were the growing pains like for them? Was it rough?
3486800	3494240	Well, it was a lot of hormones. And, uh, no, uh, I don't, I was always, I was always, I don't know.
3494240	3498080	They had sized places when I was a kid. There was like, uh, what do you mean? Some kind of a prank
3498080	3504320	show. Yeah. You had to line up in size places. So I was like from shortest to tallest for what?
3504320	3510720	The bathroom for some kind of military light maneuver. What we ducked and I'm old. So we ducked
3510720	3516720	and covered. This is cold war stuff going on here. That's right. You don't remember. You don't know
3516720	3524080	about trouble. Uh, we had the goddamn Russkies. I'm still blacklisted. I can't get movie roles
3524080	3530880	because I'm blacklisted. That's why you don't see me in movies because of my communist
3530880	3537200	affiliations. Because I tell my mother, Oh, you got my, you know, it was a tweet. I read all your
3537200	3545200	time. I'm a bitch. Did you guys, I did, we did drill. We did tornado drills. They would organize
3545200	3552400	you and rank of height size. Not rank. We weren't ranked. I didn't have to go through our training.
3553360	3559200	What are you, what are you ranked? I'm at four 11. No, is anybody has never been arranged
3559200	3564240	in a public school in size places before? Yeah. I see some photos. Maybe for like a photo. Yeah.
3565120	3571280	You're saying size places. It's better than by race, I guess. Let's line up by race.
3572320	3579200	Unless doing so, uh, uh, uh, is a gateway to finally proving race as an artificial construct.
3579200	3582560	That's true. Like if there's some major event and they're like,
3583120	3587360	like, well, we'll be Olympics. Remember when Hitler lost the Olympics? Jesse Owens. Yeah.
3587360	3592400	He's like, he didn't lose the Olympics. Germany's trying to prove racism at the Olympics. And we're
3592400	3597200	like, he didn't lose. Are you going to tell me something? Germany, Germany won all the gold
3597200	3605280	medals. Oh, what? Oh, track and field. Jesse Owens cleaned up. You're too happy about how
3605280	3612960	well Germany did. The 36 Hitler Hitler didn't lose the Olympics. Yes. Jesse Owens won a couple
3612960	3620800	of meets. Well, Netanyahu, who's the world. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Your friend, your friend,
3620800	3629200	Bibi, he's trying to say that Hitler didn't even want to slaughter the Jews. It was a Muslim who
3629360	3634080	was his friends. Put them up to it. Is that what he said? It was what? It was his friends.
3635520	3639280	And I said, stop smoking at the pool hall. You're going to, you're going to exterminate
3639280	3643200	6 million people. You keep doing that. Those guys are no good mix.
3647680	3652560	Well, yes, the, the Muslims did to inserted half of, uh, Europe wanted to kill the Jews.
3652560	3656960	He hates the Muslims, Bibi. Not, don't get me started. I'm religion folks.
3657040	3662560	Well, we do, we do want you started. Well, we've already covered it. I'm right. And everybody
3663200	3669440	love everybody, love everybody. But Netanyahu is, he hates the, he's such a, he's such an evil man
3669440	3674000	that he's wants to change the history. He wants Hitler to look good. That's his plan now.
3674000	3676960	Hitler wasn't as bad as what we've been making them out to be.
3679280	3682560	He didn't want to, he just wanted to give the Jews a talking to.
3682960	3688400	Yeah. I love the fact that, that for real, a real thing on the table was relocate all
3688400	3693120	the Jews to Madagascar. I thought you were going to say, is that a Disney movie or did that really?
3695520	3700400	Wait, when was that on the table? That was the original pitch. Oh, okay. I never heard this.
3700960	3705520	No, for real. They wanted to, they wanted to, there's an island off the Eastern coast of Africa.
3705520	3710400	We'll just send everybody there. That's kind of untenable. That's going to be pretty complicated.
3710480	3713120	Can I do the Jewish reaction to that Madagascar?
3716080	3720080	Not bad. Not so bad. It's tropical. It would be worse. It's tropical. It could be worse.
3720080	3723120	Have you been to, have you been to Poland? Not so good.
3724640	3728400	You're right. You're right across the coast from Libertasia. It's great.
3732640	3736480	Yeah. I'm not going into the area only because I'm so ignorant of it. I'll end up like running
3736480	3741840	roughshod with my dumb jokes. Oh, I know the, I know the world. I know World War II. That's one
3741840	3751280	time period. If you could cast yourself as any character, Andy, in World War II, allies, access.
3753360	3759840	It could be a Russian peasant. It could be an officer. It could be anybody going back in history
3759840	3764160	portrayers. Who would you like to portray back in time? Well, first I can say that I used to have
3764160	3768960	a joke where I said that, uh, my career is going so poorly. You know, my career is going so badly.
3768960	3774640	I would have played the Jew in Nazi propaganda films. He was like, someone has to, someone has
3774640	3779840	to do it. Someone's going to do it. They're going to cast somebody. Someone else is going to check
3779840	3784240	out. There are no small roles, Andy. There are no small roles. And then the other, the other thing
3784240	3789360	I had a joke, I was like, there's no small role. The other thing I, uh, I look scared already.
3789920	3795760	Uh, there was that movie Downfall, which is a great movie. Downfall is one of the best of all
3795760	3800960	time. It's Hitler in the bunker based on his secretary. One that the clips from that everyone
3800960	3806720	uses as the media. Yes. Yes. Yes. And, and, and based on the documentary with his secretary. Yes.
3806720	3813440	Hitler had a secretary. Uh, so I just watched all worlds at war. She's awesome. The secretary. So
3813440	3817600	my thing was that I would have liked to have punched up that script downfall because I would
3817600	3822320	have one scene where I walk in, uh, I go, I just got back from Hitler's bunker. Has he been acting
3822320	3834320	strange? Does he seem angry to you? But I probably would have played, uh, I probably would have
3834320	3841840	played, who would I have played? Maybe Mussolini. That would be amazing. That would be the best
3841840	3846960	beast story to a world war two movie ever. That's like has stars Hitler or like stars
3846960	3850320	patent or something, but it's like the cut to Hitler. And he's like, well, I'm so mad. But then
3850320	3857200	it's like, what's Mussolini doing? And it's you. Why did they call me old doochie? I don't like it.
3858640	3861680	Yes. You know what? Why did he just hang me in the public square?
3861680	3871040	It does feel from my memory of a high school world war two to history. It's like sort of like,
3871040	3877760	like, like Italy was sort of Italy with their hat and a ring. They ended up on the ally side
3878400	3882880	towards the end of the war. I found out he was a windsock. He went, whatever. Yeah,
3882880	3886960	it was just sort of like, and you see the footage of him, not that Hitler looks any less ridiculous,
3887600	3891600	but like, like, like, like the guy was like, there's always that footage where he, yeah,
3891600	3899040	he talks like this. It's like the iron chic looked more natural. Like, it's so weird. Like,
3899040	3902480	like, like, because people were like, they were actually, they didn't have cameras on them ever.
3902480	3905680	So they were like, yeah, I'm going to do this because I saw a guy do this in a movie.
3905680	3910400	Awesome footage when when Mussolini bones out of Italy, because he's just completely like left,
3910400	3916480	like, like, it surrenders. And he goes to Nazi Germany, and he gets off a plane and Hitler sees
3916560	3919520	Mussolini, who's lost so much weight, because you think it was this big,
3919520	3924400	hail, robust, you know, like, you'll bring her with a workout plan kind of thing. And
3925440	3930400	Hitler sees him, it's like, you can see like, wow, you've, you don't look so good, Mussolini.
3930400	3932240	And I'm Hitler. Hitler's saying that to him.
3932240	3938000	Yeah, look at me. Spencer, I look like the Pringles. Spencer, how would you do the logo?
3938000	3941760	Spencer, you're, you're a, you're a mythologist and a fantasy role player.
3942080	3949920	A Holocaust denier. What is your, what is your opinion about? What's your take?
3953280	3959200	How would you cast yourself? If you had to portray a role back in the then, or if, you know,
3959200	3965200	how do you see yourself? Definitely. Definitely. Just, just one of those SS guys.
3966080	3970320	They just, they just get the most, they get the most fun, you know?
3973200	3976720	They're not really dope. They don't have their name in history, you know,
3976720	3980240	but they, they did all sorts of terrible, great things.
3983440	3985360	I didn't expect you to go that direction.
3988160	3990800	Was the question, what kind of Nazi would you be?
3995200	4006000	Because if that is the case, then everything's fine. He would have been,
4007760	4014720	he would, I'd be a handsome blonde Nazi. That's what I would be. Oh, devilish. Oh, and the fun.
4016480	4018000	Get the Jews off my lawn.
4018000	4022720	Oh, and the fun.
4024480	4030480	Just a guy who does, you know, a man's man kind of, right? Not your father's SS.
4036480	4045360	Harmon, it's, it's 19, it's 1940. You are somewhere in, in continental Europe.
4045840	4047840	Continental. You wake up. No, you could be...
4047840	4048880	What does that mean?
4048880	4049680	Continental Europe.
4049680	4050240	Continental Europe?
4050240	4051040	Like Italy or something?
4051040	4052560	That means the continent, but you're not like...
4055120	4056640	It means not Wales. Yes.
4062560	4064240	I'll go there if I need a Spice Girl.
4066800	4068640	Uh, Dan, you wake up.
4068640	4069680	And I'm one short.
4069680	4074480	You wake up. You, you, you're, okay, I'm going to be Spencer about this. Let's just, let's hang on a second.
4074480	4076480	What? All right, Dan, wait.
4078480	4079840	Wait, Dan Harmon.
4079840	4080340	Yes.
4081920	4084080	The year is 1940. Shadow run.
4084800	4086160	Oh, no, Spencer, no.
4086160	4086960	Spencer, you do it.
4086960	4088240	No, he got panicked.
4088240	4094080	Spencer create a situation where Dan wakes up and he has to find his character origin.
4094080	4094800	World War II.
4095520	4098720	You wake up and you have to appoint your character origin.
4100640	4101840	World War II.
4104800	4105280	What?
4106000	4107440	Come on, Spencer, let's hit the scene.
4107440	4109360	He's in a cave, he's in a dungeon, he's in a...
4109360	4109840	He's in a...
4109840	4110960	He's on the Normandy.
4110960	4112480	I'm not really a history guy.
4112480	4114800	All right, do it emotionally.
4114800	4116080	Where is he emotionally?
4116080	4117040	It's 1940.
4117600	4118480	You're hungry.
4118480	4118720	No.
4120320	4121200	Okay.
4121200	4122560	All right, Dan, I'll set it for you.
4124160	4124960	Start at the beginning.
4129040	4129540	Dan.
4130420	4134740	Remember when Jeff started improvising the thing and briefly made it your problem?
4134740	4135220	Yeah, yeah.
4135220	4135700	No.
4135700	4137620	And then you were just like, nope.
4137620	4140340	And then he's like, okay, bluff called.
4140340	4140820	No, no, no.
4142100	4143300	He fucking jumped in.
4143300	4144580	He started doing Shadow run.
4144580	4145460	I go, oh, that's what I'm gonna do.
4145460	4146500	Well, no, but he was doing...
4146500	4149220	I feel like I hit the criteria he laid out.
4149220	4150180	Wait, by the way...
4151540	4152740	I gave him a chance to do it.
4152740	4154260	I thought he wanted to fucking get in there.
4154260	4158580	Spencer picks me up for work every day and every time I open the car and get in, he goes,
4158580	4159940	what's up?
4159940	4162740	And I go like, and then we drive.
4162740	4164500	And then there was that one day, remember?
4164500	4170340	We hit a pothole or something and I coughed and I went, and you went, what's up?
4172980	4176020	And we both were like, wait, why did that happen?
4177060	4180500	And we realized that it was like, oh, it's like...
4180500	4181860	I physically skipped.
4185140	4187940	Because the bump in the road made me make the sound
4188020	4189700	I make when I'm getting into a car.
4191700	4192980	So he went, what's up?
4195380	4199060	It was uplifting and down trotting.
4200580	4202340	Which is all you can ask from God.
4203460	4204260	All right, where were you?
4205300	4207220	Dan, you're a Jewish bank in 1940.
4207220	4207700	Take it.
4208340	4208980	Take it.
4208980	4211220	Oh, I love the money, but I hate it.
4211220	4212100	I don't know what to do.
4215460	4216420	Now, what were you gonna say?
4216420	4217060	I don't know.
4217220	4218580	I was gonna say, I was gonna say first price.
4218580	4219300	Luftwaffe.
4219300	4220580	You would be in the Luftwaffe.
4220580	4221380	I would?
4221380	4222100	Yes.
4222100	4225220	Well, by the way, I said you could be Axis or Allies.
4225220	4226500	You don't have to be German in this.
4226500	4227380	You could be anybody you want.
4227380	4228020	I'd be Rommel.
4228020	4228820	I would play Rommel.
4228820	4229300	You'd be Rommel.
4229300	4230020	Oh, yeah.
4230020	4231380	You'd be a great desert fox.
4233060	4235220	Go down that, go down the desert further.
4237700	4238740	Get away from the war.
4239380	4240500	Go down to Cape Town.
4241700	4243540	Have a fucking pina colada.
4243540	4249140	Andy, what do you think is a secret to tactical maneuvers with tanks?
4249140	4249700	Well, you have to...
4249700	4250580	I'm so glad you asked.
4250580	4251060	Yeah.
4251060	4251300	Oh.
4251300	4252020	Was it you?
4252020	4252500	Oh, yeah.
4252500	4252900	No, I was...
4252900	4254260	You have to triangulate.
4258340	4259620	I do a rear guard entry.
4261140	4262020	That sounds bad.
4262020	4263300	I don't know anything about it.
4263300	4265620	I'm gonna admit right now that I can't even improv.
4265620	4266900	You'd be a good Rommel.
4266900	4267460	Oh, yeah.
4267460	4268660	Just emotionally.
4268660	4269220	That'd be good.
4271300	4272260	Fire up the tanks.
4272340	4274500	You know, you have sang flop.
4274500	4275700	War up the tank.
4275700	4276660	War up the tank.
4276660	4277540	Yeah.
4277540	4279220	You know what I think a good war strategy would be?
4280580	4283620	But I can only test this by losing millions of lives.
4283620	4284100	Do you want the...
4285300	4285540	What?
4285540	4286740	Do you want the music for this or no?
4286740	4288180	No, there's no music necessary.
4288980	4290180	Because I'm workshopping this.
4290180	4291620	I mean, we don't go on until Tuesday.
4295220	4296980	I'm just thinking improvisationally.
4296980	4297780	You're just bit-balling now.
4297780	4298980	Just thinking through all the...
4298980	4299460	Okay.
4299860	4304900	I'm thinking, so you put yourself in charge of everybody.
4304900	4309300	You go, I'm in charge of all the armies in my country.
4310740	4315300	And then you go, I always know what I'm doing.
4315300	4316980	And it's like, I'm doing what I'm doing.
4316980	4319940	And then you secretly tell one guy, right underneath you,
4319940	4321700	you go, don't ever tell me anything.
4323700	4324900	But just let me go.
4324900	4326100	Let me do my thing.
4326100	4328500	And then you just run the whole war.
4328580	4330660	So George W. Bush and Cheney.
4330660	4330900	Yeah.
4331540	4332580	He won, right?
4332580	4333300	He fucking won.
4333300	4333780	He won.
4333780	4333940	Yeah.
4334740	4334900	Yeah.
4336980	4341220	I think if you were a strategist, what you would do is you would go,
4341220	4343060	oh, don't tell me anything.
4343060	4345860	And then let me fucking stand on balconies.
4345860	4351300	Because if I slip up, it'll be the fucking greatest strategy since D-Day.
4352740	4354260	Because I'll just be like, blah, blah, blah.
4354260	4355140	I know what I'm doing.
4356100	4359140	And then there's just a guy just running a war underneath you.
4359140	4360180	I don't know if that would work.
4362500	4364980	It sounds like someone would see through it at some point.
4367060	4368740	Why is there a guy underneath the podium?
4369620	4370420	He doesn't have to be.
4371140	4372500	You're thinking of Police Academy.
4372500	4373540	Oh, OK.
4373540	4374100	I mixed up.
4374100	4375860	And the answer is because they had to hide.
4379060	4381860	Mahoney, was that you that sucked my dick?
4382660	4384260	You guys have to watch Police Academy.
4385140	4392420	Through this like post-boat trip, post Caitlyn Jenner, post fucking 2015 world,
4392420	4396820	just watch a movie called Police Academy where it's just like one of the runners of the big,
4396820	4397700	like, quick thing.
4397700	4399780	He hides the prostitutes under the podium.
4399780	4399940	Yeah.
4399940	4409540	And it's just like the joke is that the head of all the police thinks that Steve Gutenberg
4410180	4410980	filleted him.
4411860	4412420	Right.
4412420	4419860	And so he and he's and it's just like, like, he's just he's apparently not gay,
4419860	4421860	but thinks Steve Gutenberg is.
4421860	4425380	And it's not the joke isn't that the common down is like in the closet.
4425380	4432420	The joke is that the common down is like, I'm so straight that I don't want that blowjob to get
4432420	4434100	to me, but it felt so good.
4434100	4434580	Right.
4435220	4436980	It's just such a weird way.
4437460	4443140	We were so in the closet back then that we were healthier a little bit in a lot of ways
4443140	4447940	because we put people in the center square and we like celebrated like sexuality.
4449540	4454740	You know, we celebrated gayness like in a way that we couldn't after we actually acknowledged
4454740	4457860	that it was offensive to dehumanize people.
4457860	4459780	Like I think that goes with everything.
4459780	4460020	Really.
4460020	4464900	It's like you're sort of like there's that day when you graduate to being taken seriously
4464900	4467380	and everything stops being celebratory.
4467380	4471460	But you're right, though, in a way, because the fact that you can't really have someone
4471460	4475380	like Paul Lynn, there's a character in a way because you know, you'd be stereotypical.
4475380	4475540	Yeah.
4475540	4479300	But the fact that, yeah, we didn't know like nobody knew what was going on back then.
4479300	4483860	And and half the people like, yeah, I mean, I was one of them.
4483860	4488340	Like, like the biggest bands were Queen and the Village People.
4488340	4488580	Right.
4489300	4491220	I don't care if you've ever heard of them.
4491220	4492580	Listen to those names.
4493460	4496340	Their gimmick was not to anyone in the in Wisconsin.
4496900	4501780	There was it was not known that the gimmick had anything to do with any form of lifestyle.
4501780	4503460	No, just look at the firemen.
4503460	4505060	Look at the cowboy.
4505060	4506100	They wear different outfits.
4506100	4507540	So they're singing about the YMCA.
4507540	4508260	I don't know why.
4509140	4510260	And then now it's the Navy.
4510260	4512100	They're following it with I don't know.
4513380	4514820	They're like any other group.
4514820	4516340	They sing about weird things.
4516340	4517860	Those guys have a lot of energy.
4518580	4523700	And Queen Freddie Mercury was like a fucking belt in the house.
4523700	4525860	Like like every and America was like, yay.
4525860	4526820	These people are great.
4526820	4528260	Every people were throughout history.
4528260	4530180	I've never seen that documentary, The Cellulid Closet.
4530180	4531300	Have you ever seen that?
4531300	4534020	I'm interested to see that because I'm 30 years later.
4534020	4537860	But but like the idea that like, like, like, like, yeah, obviously,
4537860	4542020	like there's a not to be stereotypical, but there's a lot of talent, like,
4542020	4545620	like sequestered in the in the in the game.
4546340	4552020	Like, like, like you are like a prosecuting attorney.
4552020	4552980	It's about the power.
4552980	4555140	It's now it's now it's 2015.
4556500	4558180	It's not progressive to say it anymore.
4558180	4560660	Like five years ago, it was like, I love gay people.
4560660	4561700	They're so talented.
4561700	4563860	Now it's like you weird homophobic weirdo.
4563860	4564340	Yeah, yeah.
4566340	4568660	That was my closure was let's hear it for the gay.
4568660	4574020	But but all of that, uh, uh, mid 80s, late 80s,
4574500	4578420	this giant pool of talent, like, like so many of them died.
4578420	4583780	And so you didn't just lose artists and like, you know, singers and like, like,
4583780	4587620	like visual artists, like you lost, you know, architects and great minds,
4587620	4592740	writers, politicians, like pop, like a huge swath of an incredibly intelligent
4592740	4596420	hip happening, like a section of our population gone.
4596420	4598420	And I don't know that we totally recovered from that.
4598420	4603140	Like, I think that's a huge, like, one of the reasons that we kind of went
4603220	4608820	into a little bit of a cultural downslide is you had the comedy boom of the late 80s.
4611300	4613860	There was some quality left.
4613860	4615860	There were two great gigs back in the 80s.
4615860	4619060	You could be a extent of comic or a guy that made brick walls behind comics.
4620500	4622020	Oh my God, the prickling move.
4623060	4628180	Those were the day when are they going to a piece of that brick, that brick concession.
4628180	4632740	Boy, or if you sold nacho materials back then you can make a lot of money.
4633460	4635860	That's what the big if you saw giant mallets.
4636500	4642900	Yeah, you know, I still call Gallagher in June and ask him what melons look good.
4645220	4648020	Should I go for the Crenshaw? Is that looking good?
4648020	4650740	Is he a good metric or a bad one?
4650740	4653700	I mean, he's well, he's using them just to smash.
4653700	4655700	Yeah. So are those the ones that are good to eat?
4655700	4657220	That's why I'm really mad at him.
4659220	4660740	There's no upside.
4660740	4662500	There's no upside to what he's doing.
4662500	4664420	He's ruining perfectly good fruit.
4665380	4668820	I thought those were, I thought that was food that someone was going to throw away.
4668820	4670340	Do you think he went down to the market?
4672740	4677220	And if you tell me, if you tell me next to that his jokes could have fed people,
4678580	4680580	I will, I will lose my mind.
4681220	4688100	He spent, you just spend eight hours a day making sure that they were all rotten and not good to eat.
4688100	4690500	I wish I hadn't said that too, as well.
4690580	4697140	How can you follow this guy with the, uh, all of our artistic people were dead?
4699220	4700420	Okay. Andy, Andy.
4703380	4703860	What are you?
4704900	4708100	What is this? A tragedy club all of a sudden?
4708740	4709620	I mean, what are we?
4710580	4713140	It's, it's 1985.
4714820	4719780	You, you absolutely have to, your, your standup career will not survive.
4719780	4723860	There's a guy with a hammer for a head that's like killing on star search.
4723860	4730420	There's, uh, there's a, there's a lady that plays two via lens and she's, she's funny too,
4730420	4731620	but she plays two via lens.
4731620	4735060	So like, like, what's, what would your gimmick be gun to your head?
4735060	4738180	Like, what if you was like, eat what you kill?
4738180	4742900	I would go, I would go full stereotypical June.
4742900	4748580	That's not, I thought we were role-playing.
4748580	4752740	No, it's not, it's not, he wasn't, he wasn't going to say, I get up and look at a stainless
4752740	4757860	steel mirror and wonder what my, when hover cars are going to, it wasn't anything.
4757860	4762500	I got one scene for Ramo. I figured out one scene for the Ramo movie is me is Ramo.
4762500	4764820	What do you mean we're out of gas? It's called a tank.
4768260	4768980	Thanksgiving.
4772580	4774660	Andy Kindler is Ramo.
4774660	4775140	It's Ramo.
4775460	4786900	Wait, hey, I admire you so much, but then part of me is like, well, what are you doing?
4786900	4788980	You're thinking about that during the show.
4788980	4791060	Right. Yeah. What's the matter with me?
4791060	4794660	So it's so boring to you. You're just like a part of your brain is like, I got it.
4796180	4798660	It's just in the background. You have that much process.
4798660	4802820	He's like a squirrel. He could, he could put nuts in my cheek.
4803780	4808740	I would like to think that the show was like fully engaging Andy Kindler's brain, but it's not
4808740	4812100	possible. I think he's, he's like, he's like a spider. He has, he has.
4812100	4813780	I'll embrace it. I won't take it personal.
4813780	4820100	No, I think I have a lot of problems and I do have ADHD, that kind of a thing.
4820820	4822660	No, I'm plugged in. Are you kidding me?
4825140	4829140	Do you want to go back to my dumb, you said, cause you said, I said, what would you,
4829140	4833700	what would your, cause it's kind of a joke. It's a joke game, but I'm, I mean,
4833700	4837300	there might be an answer. I would be like, what would we do in that era?
4837300	4841860	Crazies. I would be the guy who, uh, I can't even think of a really hacky thing.
4841860	4843860	What would be good for me? Song parodies.
4844420	4848580	Well, you, you did my fair. Well, no, but, but, but Andy, what I'm asking is like,
4848580	4851300	like, like, like, based on what, can we get a couple of song parodies?
4851300	4854740	Based on what you're good at. Like, like, like, like, based on your actual, like,
4854740	4859300	oh shit, I want to survive. And I'm being told that in order to survive,
4859300	4863620	I have to like stick out amongst like this cavalcade of characters.
4863620	4865620	Wear loud, loud suits.
4865620	4866420	Oh yeah.
4868420	4869220	I mean, what would you,
4869220	4871460	Hey folks, come on. What am I nuts?
4873620	4875780	But what do I know? I bought this suit.
4880260	4882820	I could be Reagan guy, Reagan guy, Reagan guy.
4883620	4884100	Yeah.
4884100	4884980	Be Reagan guy.
4884980	4887380	Yeah. Hey, I'm not going to mention a two.
4892100	4894500	Remember what Kevin Meany? Do you know Kevin Meany?
4894500	4895380	I love Kevin Meany.
4895380	4899620	He was so funny. And it's like, like, like, I'm not past tense. I mean, it's just like,
4899620	4900420	Yeah, he's still around.
4900420	4904500	Like, he's still around. It's still funny. But like, his gimmick was like,
4904500	4908180	he just like landed. It's so funny of people. Like you land on shit.
4908180	4911460	Like Larry, the cable guy is like his name.
4911460	4912500	Not even from the South.
4912500	4916900	Yeah. I named Dan Sanderson or whatever. There's YouTube videos of him doing jokes
4916900	4921460	about Velcro. But and then like, at one point in his standup act, there's like a guy that
4921460	4926820	comes over with cable. And he does his impression of this idiot that's coming over with cable,
4926820	4931860	right? And then everyone's like, like, Oh, what an idiot that guy is. That's so funny.
4931860	4936820	And then it's just like, after time, the Velcro jokes go away. And it's like it more and more
4936820	4938740	like it just grows outward.
4938740	4939300	Destiny.
4939300	4940580	But like Kevin Minnie's thing.
4943460	4948420	Kevin Minnie's thing was the like, like, it's just it's just it's just mother talking to him.
4948420	4950980	Oh, yeah. What are you doing? That's not right.
4950980	4951940	They're big pants.
4951940	4952980	What are you doing?
4952980	4955220	But it's like the joy of them. Yeah, that's right.
4955220	4956820	Crazy person down there.
4956820	4958180	Like, I'm not knocking it at all.
4958180	4962580	You're gonna knock your eye out with it. You probably already have your one eye jokes.
4962580	4963220	That was it.
4963220	4968740	Like, go learn something about comedy, folks. Not everything is this. There was life before
4968740	4969860	Dane Cook. All right.
4973300	4976900	Gilbert Gottfried used to do a thing when I was when he when I was like when I was like
4976900	4983540	15 years old humble brag the the like watching like, and I remember I remember watching a
4983540	4987140	Gilbert Gottfried special and I was like, Oh, that's that guy that talks like this and he's
4987140	4992660	in the candy bar commercials. Like, I think he was on SNL one year and I don't know anything
4992660	4998660	about him. And I watched his 45 minute set. And it was like, Holy shit, this guy's a goddamn
4998820	5005380	genius because he would he would come out and he does the comedy and do the act. And it doesn't
5005380	5011620	really matter the performance style. But I do it like this. And I do it like that. And then but
5011620	5017620	then he would pause. And then there would be a pause. And then he'd go, No, why would you do
5017620	5021940	something like that? No, later would turn out. I didn't know he was doing his impression. I think
5021940	5027540	of Seinfeld. Yeah, I used to do. He was doing his super ego. His Seinfeld impression is really
5027940	5032260	Oh, it's perfect. But I didn't even know I didn't come up to it was just funny that he was just
5032260	5037780	doing like a dialogue. He was doing his act. And I do the joke. And I do the setup. And then the
5037780	5045780	punchline pause. That's not something you want to do. Why do you have to screech it people?
5045780	5050340	Well, that sounds like a little bit. Well, I'm not I'm not doing that. I'm not even going to attempt
5050900	5056260	like Gilbert Gottfried Seinfeld impression. Well, he had that one joke where he says,
5056260	5062260	he goes, Ben, the Martian ship landed in the and the head Martian came up to me and he said,
5062260	5065060	Ben Gazzara is a good actor. How come he can't get a series?
5068900	5070660	Ben Gazzara was was a good actor.
5073300	5078500	Cassavetes. Oh, these people don't know Ben Gazzara now. No. Oh, you're gonna be 25. And not
5078500	5084100	no Ben Gazzara. Right. You know what? You deserve the earth to burn to a crisp underneath your feet.
5084340	5087300	I'm glad you don't know how to desalinate seawater.
5089540	5094660	Here's a hint. You boil it. It's just too expensive. You're gonna die.
5097060	5102100	It's perfectly easy thing to do when there's eight of you. You're all gonna die.
5103060	5108980	You should have your own your own tableau. There's no water. The planet's 80% water. There's more
5108980	5113940	of an every day. It's too expensive to make a drinkable. That's your hook. That would be your
5113940	5118500	catchphrase. It's too expensive to make it drinkable. It's too expensive to make it drinkable.
5120420	5125220	If you put half the money, you put it to NASCAR. You don't get her done.
5125940	5130980	Your water might be too expensive. I made a joke today. I was a random joke. I don't know
5130980	5135060	why, where I was in this area. I have no idea because I'm a hack and I'm old and whatever.
5135060	5139460	But I was like, I don't know. I was thinking about Jeff Foxworthy and it was like, who doesn't?
5140100	5146260	So I wrote a tweet and it just said like, I'm probably gonna butcher my own
5146260	5149060	unfunny tweet. But it was just like, the joke was just, it was quote.
5153220	5160260	Life isn't given to people, Amanda. Life is a test. And I'm giving it. Dash
5162020	5165300	leak dialogue from the trailer for Foxworthy by Aaron Sorkin.
5165860	5170260	Because he's famous for giving a redneck test.
5173300	5175220	Wait, that Aaron Sorkin isn't famous.
5175220	5176660	No, no. Jeff Foxworthy is.
5176660	5178340	He's the inventor of walking and talking.
5178340	5182100	Foxworthy and all caps. So then I got so many tweets and there's people like,
5182100	5188180	there was like one guy in particular that was like, Foxworthy, is that about Jeff Foxworthy?
5188180	5191860	Scratch that off my list. And I'm like, all right.
5191860	5192500	I want to meet that guy.
5192500	5196980	I know I'm 42, but I'm like, what? What do you mean?
5196980	5198180	What did he mean?
5198180	5204260	And he's like, he kind of stoops a little bit, albeit respectfully, because he's not being
5204260	5209620	condescending, but he understands that I didn't get his joke. And he goes like, the premise of
5209620	5216100	the joke is that I mistook the title for being about Jeff Foxworthy. And so I was no longer
5216900	5224660	a enthusiastic about seeing the movie. And so I said, oh, oh, I get it now,
5224660	5231460	but you're still going to go see the movie, right? And he goes, well, now that yes,
5231460	5235700	to further bury the shame of my bad attempted humor, yes, I will go see it.
5235700	5242900	And I said, well, hold on a second. Uh oh. If they make a, you know, if there's a movie called
5242900	5248420	Foxworthy, they're going to have to expect you to make the association with the guy that you
5248420	5254180	thought of immediately. So it wasn't a lame joke in a world where that movie exists.
5256180	5261620	And he's like, okay. Yeah, you're right. I guess I just liked the idea of
5261620	5268020	seeing those rednecks walking out of the movie theater puzzled. And then he said, yeah,
5268660	5273540	dumbasses. Yeah. Talk about failing a test.
5275860	5282580	Like the famous test. The Jeff Foxworthy. What's he doing? What happened to the test there at the
5282580	5287140	end? And what's the famous test? Andy Dan. I'm gonna act like he's not here. Dan's in a very
5287140	5296500	weird place right now. Okay. I don't think people would consider it a test. You're saying, you know,
5296500	5303940	you're a red, redneck when Dan sees that as Jeff Foxworthy issuing a test on you. Oh,
5304820	5309300	all right. Now hold on a second. All right. If you can file answer the following questions,
5309940	5316260	you just might be a redneck. That's exactly literally his bed. That's why his set wasn't
5316260	5322820	called Pollock jokes or like he literally only just did that. Like you might be a redneck gift.
5322820	5327540	Yes. He, instead of saying, how can you tell when a redneck screws in a light bulb? He said,
5327540	5333860	you might be a redneck if, boy, okay. All right. I'm the bad guy. Well, you ruined the originality
5333860	5340580	of his concept with that. Now I realize it's, it seems like a similar, like a familiar saw.
5340580	5344340	Well, also there's some poor kid out there and how it's looking for that movie. And,
5345300	5349060	and he's going to eventually find out that I was big. Did you worry about him the rest of the day?
5349140	5352340	That guy, like, what have I done? And did I hurt his feelings?
5352340	5354500	Because that's what I do on Twitter all the time.
5354500	5360900	Well, I know. No, someone went, no, I cared nothing for people in the virtual environment.
5360900	5365940	I worry about me doing my job of like, like fitting in and making people happy.
5365940	5369620	Yeah. Well, I think the amount of time I spend on Twitter is exact.
5371300	5376420	I mean, Dan, you came, we took different flights out of New York. I landed in Seattle and I had a
5376420	5381620	bunch of notifications saying like, make them stop. I'm like, make what stop? I laid, I, I laid
5381620	5385620	on my bed and it's like, I tried to get, I was like, how do I scroll back to the, to the origin
5385620	5396100	story? I had a Twitter meltdown. Is this true? Of course it's true. That's a word that has an
5396100	5402900	empirical definition, isn't it? How could you ever argue with it? If someone says you're having a
5402900	5408260	Twitter meltdown, how could they ever be wrong? It's called meltdown. Oh yeah. Brought to you by
5408260	5416260	Twitter. I'm always thinking. Andy. By the time Dan finishes the story, I want three more Rommel
5416260	5421540	jokes. Okay. Okay. God damn it. You're taking, you're making fun of the fact that the show isn't
5421540	5426420	enough for his brain. No, that's not what he's doing. No, I'm saying his brain is so commodious.
5427460	5431460	Yeah. He can't, it can't be filled with my petty stories about defending my behavior.
5431460	5435940	You misread me. I have the same problem of everybody else in the world, which is like,
5436980	5441460	a huge deal. What's going on and how, how do I look? How do I look while this is happening? Yeah.
5441460	5446180	Am I bombing? Am I not bomb? In general, every conversation, every minute, every meal,
5446180	5451620	did I bomb? Am I bombing? Am I going over well? So that's what you said with me. Which is all I've
5451620	5455860	ever said. No, no, no, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, wait, now I'm worried and I'm doing
5455860	5459620	the same thing because I'm worried. You'd think that I have any problem with, with, we're doing
5460100	5466340	an uncomfortable improv now. No, no, no, no. Let me say, before we go further, I was concerned.
5466340	5470580	That's the beautiful jellyfish, like, like, like crazy ballet that we do. If we could all just be
5470580	5475620	honest about the fact that we all are constantly concerned, that, that, that is confident and
5475620	5480660	wonderful as we think we all are, that there's a word for something that doesn't need any input
5480660	5485460	at all or any perception of itself through other people's eyes, which is like a fucking rock or a,
5486180	5491220	an air. Like, it's not worth living to be that. And it's like, we're primates. We're constantly
5491220	5496500	fucking just like hacking it up and like, like trying to make sure that we're driving okay.
5496500	5501540	And it swirls the irony that we also know that people don't like people that aren't confident,
5501540	5505620	people that are, that care too much, what do people think and all that stuff. But, but yeah,
5505620	5510180	and we all do that. And it's like, only if you're self-aware, you do that. Right. If you're a fucking
5510180	5517300	idiot, it's like 90% of the world. Then I have to carry you. And then you go, where are my
5517300	5531140	footprints? And I'm like motherfucker. It's my joke, the Foxworthy movie, not yours.
5531140	5539700	I'm the Jesus in that tweet. Yes. It's the worst when you make a joke and then someone tries to
5539780	5546740	tag your joke with your literal joke as if they fucking came up with it. How can you think
5547460	5554020	everyone kill yourself? To make up an example, let's say you just go like you're tweeting,
5554020	5557380	you're watching a soccer game. I'm going to make up an example because I don't want to try to riff
5557380	5562420	like real things. I was like, you're like, uh, I thought it was, I thought it was weird of, uh,
5562420	5569300	of Pele to Pele. I would go with Pele too. I tried to pick a topic that wouldn't be
5569300	5576740	distracting. Yeah. Just generic soccer. Cathy current cast your memories back to the early
5576740	5583140	seventies. You want to go with Ronaldo? You go with Ronaldo over here. I'm all, I'm as interested
5583140	5590980	in you guys about, uh, deflate gate, but I thought it was weird of so-and-so to hand out such and
5590980	5596420	such, you know, like some comedy for this. You tweet that it's like a joke. So then like, so then,
5596580	5601460	so then there's something, there's like eight replies underneath that where people who simply
5601460	5608020	read what you said. Yeah. Yeah. And apparently assumed that what you are in their life is just
5608020	5614180	like some piece of driftwood that provides just fucking unentertaining information.
5614980	5617780	And they're just like, they get their blinking tie on and they're just like, Hey,
5617780	5620900	what's that you say? You say that. Well, how about I connect it to that? Hey, what are you,
5620900	5628980	Hey, how are we? And it's like, wait a minute. What the fuck? I just said, my joke is dry and
5628980	5634340	subtle and like should be recognizable as a joke. Blinking tie. That's the one I would have gone
5634340	5640820	with in the beginning. Merry Christmas. Blinking tie. You got Pele blinking tie.
5640820	5645780	I guess you'd have to think of a real example. One of these, it happens like nine times a day.
5645780	5652100	Anytime you do anything that's that that teeters towards satire or irony, someone's going to
5652100	5657140	absolutely totally misinterpret it. Absolutely think like, just read it literally. And then make
5657140	5663060	their own joke. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing. In fact, it would be shameful. It would
5663060	5667060	be market research, for instance, to find out that if somebody was like, what do you mean?
5667700	5671700	That doesn't seem like a good thing for Pele to do at all. You're like, you know what? My joke
5671700	5676740	didn't land. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Like, like, you know what? That's 1% of the audience,
5676740	5681140	but it still counts for me. Like, I'm going to work hard. I'm a kindler about it. I'm a kindler.
5683220	5688340	But it's the thing that fucking I don't, it just scrambles my circuits is when somebody's like,
5688900	5695460	like Pele, more like melee, since you're like, wait, no, but it doesn't, you can't know you're
5695460	5701460	using my launch pad is not your point of departure. It's fictional. I made a joke. You live, you live
5701540	5708260	in a joke world. You're satirizing a joke universe. You didn't even think about anything.
5708260	5714020	You're just connecting words. That's insane. And what do you say? You can't say, I just don't know
5714020	5719540	what to do. And everyone goes like, you do anything. Why are you on Twitter? You're such a loser.
5719540	5724100	Why are you on Twitter? I love them. Why are you having a meltdown? Why are you wasting your time
5724100	5730980	talking to me? That says a lot about you. Look at you. You're gross. You know what?
5730980	5736980	You're a piece of shit. Did you like making that guy feel bad? Well, guess what? You're fat.
5739060	5745300	Oh, so, so it's bad to make a nice try. But what you did was unacceptable.
5747300	5752180	But you're fat. And you're not funny. And you still got canceled. And you know,
5752180	5759060	I know what you're trying to do. And it doesn't feel like anything. That's my point. I can't feel.
5761460	5770180	I am. How much clearer could I be that I ran into the streets and smashed a Ferrari that was driving
5770180	5777380	by and plucked the least likable background person that existed in that moment and bit its head off
5777380	5783380	after saying, I'm going to bite this guy's head off. Do you know why? Because I'm getting a
5783380	5792740	divorce and I'm very unhappy with myself. Good thing it happened to the one fucking guy that
5792740	5801540	deserved it. Hilarious. Don't follow me if you don't like it. Don't fuck it. But all of the fucking
5801540	5808740	like, like this weird like contingent of people like, oh, I saw the paste magazine article. I
5808740	5815540	didn't. What the fuck are you talking about? I am so sorry that the shit I go through in my
5815540	5823380	kitchen at three a.m. ends up in something called paste magazine. I am not complaining about that
5823380	5830900	at all. However, I will tell you that has nothing to do with me. Your relationship with paste magazine
5830900	5836740	is not my fucking problem. Starting with the fact that this is where you get your news
5836740	5844660	and ending with the fact that you follow people you hate and that you seek to destroy them by
5844660	5851300	being so mean to them and that you're so bad at it that I just want to kiss you because you can't
5851300	5862980	even hurt my feelings. Chevy Chase? Oh, that hurts so bad. You're right. I am so famous.
5862980	5872580	I really am so untalented for how much money I have. You're doing great. Have you considered
5872580	5879780	being Hannibal Lecter? You really got that saying exactly what's going to undo them thing down.
5881700	5889140	Nobody. I went sat on my back patio and I was watching my dogs take a shit after 48 hours of
5889220	5894740	me going like I did this and then people are like I saw that article in HuffPo and you're a bad
5894740	5901140	person. Again, I don't know what you're talking about. I've died. This is my only place. I had a
5901140	5906900	fucking said I'm going to pull this kid's legs off. Then I did it. I went back through it several
5906900	5916820	times. It's very funny. I feel nothing is my whole point. I said it. I've never been more confident
5916820	5923060	in anything I've done in my entire life. What is the opposite of a meltdown? A build up?
5924340	5932500	I built up. Giant roach. Okay. As long as it's something that never happens in LA and was worth
5934020	5935380	derailing a god.
5935380	5941460	I made that roach.
5948980	5950660	You're contrite about it at least. That's nice.
5953300	5957860	I am not at all because like I said, I went through it. No, it's just funny. It was like
5957860	5962020	an art piece. I don't know this person. Why aren't people so rude to each other? I kept saying to
5962020	5965780	people over and over again, Hey, you know, it's weird. It's almost like you shouldn't be mean to
5965780	5973620	people. You never know when someone's going to be really good at it. It's crazy. Well,
5973620	5978180	that's why I'm not mean to people. I've never said a bad thing to fucking. This guy terrifies
5978180	5985060	me. Like, if you want to be on Andy Kindler's bad side, bad idea, terrible. So I fucking I'm
5985140	5988820	he's like, it's like Rommel would say, but Rommel would say,
5991140	5996100	Hey, look, Richardson. Yeah. You know how we're going to be protected on this mission? We're in a
5996100	6007780	tank. Calm down. I like, I like that one of the Nazis, uh, uh, uh, uh, takers is Richard Richardson.
6008740	6013700	He should have responded for the English spy. He was. I like that. I think I also like that
6013700	6017860	Rommel has this really intimate relationship where he's like, look, I'm fighting patent over
6017860	6022740	here. We're playing a game of human chess on the order of millions, but this fucking Richardson
6022740	6028820	guy, I can't help it. I'm Rommel. I play to the guy in the back. I don't trust this. I don't trust
6028820	6036020	this new Churchill who's on the crew. Okay guys, we're going to take the flank. There's going to
6036020	6040420	be a sacrifice of human life, but you should think about it as laying a carpet down for a
6040420	6047940	thousand year Reich Richardson. So help me God. Don't you give me that fucking look. What would
6047940	6054180	I do? What would I do? Richardson, you know what you do. It's like Greenberg, Greenberg. You look
6054180	6060020	nervous. What's the problem Greenberg? Would you stop sweating? Why are you nervous all the time?
6060020	6062740	You're like a Jew. You're like, if I didn't know better, I think you were a Jew.
6064020	6070020	So help me Christ. If we get through this and we successfully cleanse the globe of every race,
6070020	6075460	other than white people, I will personally make sure that your children are paired in a way that
6075460	6083380	makes them the new minority. And it won't be hard because all science points to the idea
6083380	6089780	that exegeny is the key to genetic health. General, uh, sorry to interrupt you. You're
6089780	6095860	wanted in the front right now. I hate to interrupt you talking to the... Are you doing something
6095860	6101460	real or is this part of the page? I was just saying... Are you doing Ramo? Is that Ramo? No,
6101460	6108740	I'm saying I'm an adjutant. I'm an aide to camp. I'm saying Ramo. Oh, I know. At the front. Yes.
6108740	6113780	I thought you meant the front of the bookstore. You're the general. Yeah. I'm just saying there's
6113780	6118260	a war happening and we need you at the front. Oh. Your kibbit saying... You know what? That's the
6118340	6126820	last thing I need right now is your aggravating war news. That's Ramo. You're the general of the
6126820	6137300	African core. I can't hear it right now. I'll be in my even more protected quarters of the tank.
6137300	6142180	I want to know what you thought it could have been in the front of the room. Yeah. What you thought
6142180	6147540	Jeff was saying. Hey Andy, there's so much weight. Did you think it was like... I think the
6147540	6157780	anti-defamation league or... A little too much. Too much Netanyahu talk. Or finally Adam Sandler
6157780	6167060	comes down to confront me. There's just a coalition. They're all great biceps. Leto's out there.
6168660	6173540	Wait, Leto. Hey. What are you doing here? Hey, did you hear my comment? You can't
6174500	6179540	hear me. You can't hear me. You had a guy with a podcast. Sure. Yeah. Just one joke. Just one
6179540	6186180	joke. Leto, do you know why you're here? No, no, no. You see, I got a roadster outside if anybody
6186180	6192820	wants to look right there. Hey, Leto. Do you know that Jay Leno has a car that runs on his patented
6192820	6209620	head shake? That's renewable energy. That's a green source. He's leaving only footprints.
6210740	6215860	This car keeps my hamburger buns in it. Leto, can I get it in your car and just take one quick
6215860	6219700	ride? Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure. Wow, this is amazing. This car looks
6219700	6226100	great. Yeah. Do you believe it? It almost makes up for my lack of personality. How about...
6227540	6233060	One of my favorite things you ever did. You were at Igby's and you went off on Dennis Miller for
6233060	6242420	a hundred years. Hey, look, it's like crime and punishment with Karalchnikov. He's so sad now.
6246580	6250740	He sells smart... Do you listen to him on AM radio? Do you ever... I do somebody driving
6250740	6254900	home. Oh God. He sells something called smart mouth. Like he sells these products and you know
6254900	6260820	he hates doing it. But he's like, yeah, smart mouth. It's like a breath of short type thing.
6260820	6266660	But he's got a smart mouth that's a marriage made in heaven. Oh, synergy. Conservative heaven.
6266660	6273060	If you like synergy, baby. Synergy. I haven't seen this much synergy since Pepsi turned out to be the
6273700	6281460	most favorite soda in Back to the Future 2. Yeah. Look, Heisenberg, the only uncertainty I see
6281460	6291860	is some other reference they really... How come you've been doing comedy for 30 years?
6296020	6300820	Was he a switcher? Was he liberal? Well, here's the truth. I think the truth is that
6301700	6305540	he used to... Kevin Rooney was a guy who used to work on his show and I think Kevin Rooney was
6305540	6309140	very politically aware. But I don't think Dennis Miller was ever that politically aware, but he
6309140	6314100	was funny. The black and white movie. He was like a liberal guy, right? I thought I remember that.
6314100	6317700	I think he was a faux liberal. I think he was always... He was a people pleaser,
6317700	6323700	which that's good enough for me. You're done as a liberal. Like just be a people pleaser.
6323700	6329460	Well, I thought he was always unpleasant. No, no, but I mean, he was trying. I'm saying like,
6329460	6333220	if that's your goal, then you're fine because that will lead you to all the right votes and
6333220	6339220	all the right behaviors. Like, right? Otherwise it's you're going like, well, I gotta protect
6339220	6342340	me and mine. Or like, okay, well now you're getting into... Yeah, he lives up... I mean,
6342340	6347300	it's just unbelievable. This guy lives rich, filthy rich, lives up in Santa Barbara, but he's still
6347300	6353460	miserable since 9-11. Miserable, like it was personal. Since 9-11? No, that's it. Are you sure
6353460	6357300	you didn't get miserable and then use that as a... Like I'm using my divorce. I'm just like,
6357380	6360420	I'm getting divorced. Like, come on. You were already a piece of shit.
6364260	6368740	These colors don't run. Andy, you were in San Francisco, right? Or no, LA?
6368740	6371780	Where did I start? You mean? Yeah. Well, I'm from New York, but I started out in LA.
6371780	6376100	Okay. So you weren't one of the San Francisco... No, but I used to go up in the late 80s and early
6376100	6380260	90s and all those guys when they were living up there, David Feldman and Brian Possain and all
6380260	6386260	those guys. Yeah. Well, I hate to dwell on, because I'll never... Dennis Miller, I remember his
6386260	6390260	special, Mr. Miller Goes to Washington. Do you remember that? Is this after the change?
6391140	6395300	I don't think it was... No, it was way before 9-11. Is that what you mean? I don't remember
6395300	6398580	that change. Yeah. Well, I don't know where the change happened. That's why I'm asking. No,
6398580	6403220	it was after 9-11, because he used to have... His most famous one is Black and White,
6403220	6407060	is the funniest one. But I don't even know if that would be funny if I watched it now.
6407060	6410580	Was he like, do you have a conservative slant in that? I'm just so curious about Dennis Miller's
6410580	6416900	political... He would be like... He would be liberal about gay issues and things like that,
6416900	6421220	but then he would be like, yeah, fry him. Right. So like libertarian. That's right.
6421220	6426340	It's like liberal against way. It's like, yeah, hey, who cares about gay people as long as I
6426340	6430740	got money, buh-gah-boom. Right. But also he had great writers on the old Dennis Miller show.
6430740	6435220	So I think people thought that he was a politically aware guy. I don't think he really ever was. I
6435220	6440180	think he's a guy who knows references, but doesn't really know what they mean necessarily.
6440260	6452260	But it's just like Colgan Skotska. He's like... How? Right. How? He's like an encyclopedic
6452260	6458500	memory for any reference. Oh. Like a Roy Rogers on all of a sudden triggers on vacation there.
6458500	6465620	And I hate those people. Look, Marlene Dietrich. These people don't even care. Nobody cares about
6465620	6469700	him anymore. That's the nice thing. That's the thing. Who do you think is funny right
6469700	6473780	now? Who do you think is kicking ass? I love a domain. James, a domain.
6477460	6482500	There's so many great people, Maria Bamford. There's so many great people. I always buy my
6482500	6486740	Ron Funches. Sheila McRae.
6493300	6497460	Cheers to Andy Kindler for keeping a gender balance and his shout out to Young Comics of the
6497460	6505380	Day. Cheers to the same Kindler for evoking the ghost of pirates. Shiver McCare. Shiver
6505380	6513700	McCimbers. Ah, the pieces of eight will be on your pox. I will guard this locker with me very
6513700	6523060	barnacle-laden soul. Plus, this airline food is unacceptable. If you could resurrect Andy,
6523060	6527940	like somebody dead, like a dead comic, you'd go see him do a set right now if you could bring
6527940	6533620	anybody back. I would pick Lenny Bruce because the only thing that I've seen is, and I actually
6533620	6537700	enjoy it, but a lot of people don't like it, is the performance film, which is the last. And I've
6537700	6543620	seen things on Steve Allen. But like Richard Pryor, we have that concert film, which is still the
6543620	6547780	greatest thing of all time, I think, that's especially made. But we don't have that with
6547780	6551700	Lenny Bruce as much, except on the record. So I'd love to have seen him in the close.
6551780	6556580	The stuff I've seen with Lenny Bruce, it doesn't match up with how funny he was to people that you
6556580	6563140	know what they're talking about. They saw him perform live. Their relationship with Lenny
6563140	6567220	Bruce is way different than what I get. Or the movie Lenny, for example, which is like nothing
6567220	6571540	like Lenny Bruce at all. What about Bill Hicks? You must have crossed his path. I got to work with
6571540	6578500	him. I was very lucky. I got to work with Bill Hicks the week after he got sober in 1988,
6578500	6584980	three weeks in a row. And he had just gotten and he was like kind of so angry and so hilarious.
6584980	6589460	Like one night he was, I was in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He goes, yep, next week I'll be on
6589460	6598660	Letterman. You people will still be here in this shithole. He got so activated. Is that is have we
6598660	6602020	because I saw that documentary about him. That was like largely pictures. Did you see that one?
6602020	6607060	I haven't seen that. Like the myth of Bill Hicks. I have no I will very, very readily accept that
6607060	6613540	the myth is 100% and more like like accurate. But I also wonder, do comics need that figure in
6613540	6618100	their life of the guy that went rogue and became the funniest guy in the world and then and that
6618100	6622500	big because and then pass. Well, I don't know. I mean, it's like a lot of people see him and they
6622500	6627620	go. I mean, I think he's one of these things like people who did see Lenny Bruce live or did see. I
6627620	6632980	mean, Bill Hicks live was unbelievable because he was so seamless. He was so like seamless in that
6633060	6637460	he was talking to the crowd the way he would talk. And so I think that that might be missed. If you
6637460	6643540	see his stuff on video, right? I don't know. I mean, he's got he has a lot of stuff on, you know,
6643540	6650500	that he filmed. But people get caught up in the I don't know, they get caught up in the fucking
6650500	6656260	mic. Well, a lot of comics tried to be like him too. Well, that's the worst of them all. Yeah.
6656260	6663700	Oh, I I did stand up when I was in Milwaukee in the post Bill Hicks fucking man. Right. Everybody
6664580	6671860	I was like, like, dude, you're not that mad about anything. You love cheese curds so much.
6672580	6679220	You were so funny eight minutes ago. Yeah. Yeah. Also, your entire club was bricks everywhere.
6680900	6682980	No, you couldn't find a door to save your life.
6683940	6686340	Oh, that's what that's what drove Bill Hicks out of his mind. Yeah.
6687220	6692500	You started in Milwaukee? Yes. Dan, do you remember any of your openers? Do you have an
6692500	6699140	open? Jeff, why don't you go fuck yourself? Like, I have never I'm not saying do it. I'm
6699140	6705140	saying to you. I'm not saying you must do one. Do you remember any of that? I don't like I'm
6705140	6712260	going to say no. And here's why it's 10 o'clock. And I'm ashamed of one thing in my life. And that
6712260	6719380	is my stand up set when I was 17. Yeah. But you know, the lucky thing, though, is that we'd have
6719380	6724900	cameras as like, it's like you're putting out some challenge for anyone in Milwaukee that has
6724900	6731380	there's footage. Oh, there is. So did you have an acid wash jacket? No, worse. I had a terrible act.
6732980	6739620	Well, everybody's terrible. Everybody's act. Yeah. Okay. I watched an old footage of me.
6739620	6743140	There used to be a couple of rascals comedy club and they somehow I remember signing the
6743140	6748260	release. I could see my face as I signed it. But it was like, so they have all this footage of when
6748260	6753700	I first started. And so I was scared to death. But I did see a joke I like, which was like in 1989,
6753700	6757860	I wrote the joke, Jews are obsessed with Hitler, because we can't remember anything about the
6757860	6775300	Pharaoh. I found that joke too topical. I absolutely promise you that. But in the story
6775300	6778500	of my life is that I would go like, no, you'd hate it, you'd hate it, you'd hate it. And people
6778500	6784500	like dig it up. And they'd go like, wait, that's awful. I'd be like, motherfucker. I told you I
6784580	6790900	buried one thing. I asked you to bury it. And again, I'm not saying do it. Is there a joke
6790900	6793780	that you're proud of you remember that you did you have one that you think might still hold up?
6793780	6802420	No, no, no, no. Okay. Highlights that I remember. I used the C word in my act. Like a lot.
6803860	6812500	I thought at 17, the reason unsuccessful comics didn't use it. And Andrew Dice Clay did
6813460	6822820	is because he was smart and brave. And I used the C word in a giant chunk of my bit about how I
6822820	6828420	didn't like women at my college that were of a certain category that we're doing. What would
6828420	6841060	you call them sometimes? Just for the unpleasant. I did a then I would talk about jerking off for
6841060	6846100	a while, which is like, fine, we're in safe territory. Like, like, that's fine. Like, like,
6846100	6852420	like just punish yourself. But then I but I would at the time Jeffrey Dahmer had just
6852420	6858340	eaten a bunch of people. So I had a lot of Dahmer jokes. Talk about your lean cuisine.
6861620	6865540	Ramo, the guy with your lips, your lips to my set list.
6865540	6873380	Ramo, none of them that funny. Oh, someone Oh, we're having someone's jowl again. There's
6873380	6882740	some and then I would and then I would close. I closed with a it wasn't a rap. It was a song.
6882740	6887380	It was like, I don't know what my what my premise was. I don't know why it was in the country
6887380	6892740	western theme. It was a song about masturbation and it would make the audience would clap and
6892740	6897860	I would sing the song. It was me rhyming about masturbation. Yeah, but you were 17, right? Yes,
6897860	6902500	I wish I was 16. What have you been wearing an app? What did you expect? You're not gonna
6902500	6907060	wear an ascot and smoke a pipe at that age. I do. But I'm telling but all I'm saying is just that
6907060	6912340	like, I'm like, everybody loves to like, talk about how bad they were. It's like, it's like,
6912340	6917060	genuine looks like, you know, have you ever been genuinely ashamed? Like, you're just like, like,
6917060	6922740	no, this isn't cute. Like, it's like, fucking like, holy shit. This is absolutely. I mean,
6922740	6929060	how could you? How could anybody not have those experiences unless you're we're genius the first
6929060	6933140	time or something like that? I don't know why. And who were those people? I don't know. But I
6935140	6939300	wrote my friend Rob shop say he was doing stand up at the same time a couple years older than me,
6939300	6944900	which I will now emphasize the but like, like when we talk about Oh, remember, we did stand up. It
6944900	6950500	was so we were so unfunny. Like, here's shrubs version of the hack years in Milwaukee. shrubs
6950500	6956340	bits were like, like, what what if what if what if the bat signal came on while Batman was taking a
6956340	6962980	shit? That's like, that's good bad. Like, like, like, like, Oh, my god, that give Aaron Sorkin
6962980	6967460	wrote a movie and you fucking panned through a club about Rob shrub. It's like, Oh, here I am
6967460	6975940	doing my bad stand up. And he would do his other bit was like, Oh, you know, Tonto and, and bones
6975940	6981860	from Star Trek, but their their main job was telling their boss that people were dead. And then
6981860	6985540	he would talk about that. And then he would, and then he would do a split screen effect where he
6985540	6991060	would do him dead Kimo Sabe. He's dead Jim, him dead Kimo Sabe. Like, and he was but he was like,
6991060	6994660	he called out the split screen. And it was 1991. And it was awesome.
6995620	7000020	And it was like, this guy's so funny. And now it's like, Oh, remember, we're bad stand ups. No,
7000020	7006340	I was saying the C word. And I was doing country western songs and making people clap about Dahmer
7006340	7010260	like it was like, that's there's a different there's a kind of bad that makes you like,
7010260	7012420	finish all the person on your plate. Boom, boom.
7015540	7016740	Can I everybody thank you so much.
7016740	7025300	Thank you, Spencer. Spencer, we really did it. Andy Kindler, everybody.

7039460	7044580	Hey, we're gonna be in New York. Talk about New York for a second. Yeah. Because we sold,
7044580	7049300	we sold out the first New York show. So we we did a second one the night after and we're
7049300	7057620	pretty concerned. What are the dates in November? I don't know. But Steve, 13 to 14. So come to the
7057620	7062900	I think 13 to sold out already. And so if you're around the East Coast and want to come out,
7062900	7066500	or if you have a lot of discretionary funds, I want to fly yourself out first class.
7067460	7071860	Get a permit and we'll stay at the Ritz Carlton. And if you're if you're at the first show,
7071860	7076900	and you're like, Hey, I think I'll come to both. I the one upside of having no act is that you
7076900	7083060	won't hear anything twice. Yeah. Please come to both shows. Also a second show clothing optional.
