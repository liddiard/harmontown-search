0	1000	Did I hear a yup?
1000	2000	Please tell me I heard a yup.
2000	26500	From Hollywood, California, Seltown Comics, Armistown, and now, the
27500	32500	Please welcome to the stage, the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
32500	35500	Thank you.
44500	45500	Thank you.
45500	47500	Don't know how to smile.
47500	68500	Okay, so there is a neighbor on my block who has a beautiful varnished wood enclosure for their garbage cans with little special locks on it.
68500	91500	This is where he keeps his garbage containers before he allows them to be put out on the street.
91500	100500	No, no, no, this is when they're just off the curb, there's this big garbage can hutch, you know?
100500	102500	Some people do this.
102500	112500	I walk past it and I go, maybe his big fear is homeless people benefiting?
112500	114500	No, no, no, no.
114500	116500	Or raccoons or something.
116500	119500	Or Aaron, who can see the brighter side of some things.
119500	130500	I was walking past it with her and I said something shitty about it and she said, maybe the dad of that family loves his kids and wanted to show them woodworking or something.
130500	137500	Everything Aaron says to me is always like a subtle barb about how much Minecraft I'm playing.
137500	142500	I don't even know if she thinks about it.
142500	150500	Those donuts look good. Yeah, they look real. They're not made of pixels. They're probably great.
150500	153500	She doesn't even know she's doing it anymore.
153500	157500	And I was chasing by that. I was like, you know what? She's right. Why am I so toxic?
157500	159500	Who knows what the backstory is?
159500	164500	That could be a cancer bin, like a cancer project of some kind.
164500	168500	Someone could have cancer and they made it out of their cancer. I don't know.
168500	175500	You have no idea. There could be a movie about it starring Will Smith called like Three Garbage Cans.
175500	181500	And the tagline is like, there's a bin for your recycling. There's a bin for your compost.
181500	188500	There's no bin for where you go when you got no hope.
188500	191500	Do you have a working title for that movie?
191500	195500	Three bins? I don't know. It doesn't matter.
195500	205500	But I haven't told Aaron this yet, but I am right and she is wrong because I was walking past it again today.
205500	212500	So here's the wooden enclosure with the bins in it. And then the whole thing is like...
212500	220500	Wait, hang on. Describe this for me. Is the whole thing closed off to the street or is it open that a trash truck can come in with a little robotic arm?
220500	222500	Their relationship with the city? I don't know how this works.
222500	228500	Because I don't know if the person that goes out there at the beginning of the day with like a key and like, have at it, fellas. I have no idea.
228500	232500	Do they take them out on trash day and put them out on the street?
232500	235500	Let's assume that. Let's assume this is a pretty orderly person. I'm not...
235500	243500	It would be ridiculous to put that much effort and aesthetic appeal into something that was also just an obstruction, like a civic disobedience.
243500	250500	Yeah, because if that's the case, that might just be an aesthetic thing where they don't want their facade of their home to be sullied by...
250500	256500	I've already given this person the benefit of the doubt. They might have cancer.
256500	264500	Yes, obviously they thought it looked good. If only there was a way to find out if they were a douchebag.
264500	270500	If only there was some other dot where you could draw a line.
270500	280500	We learn in geometry that a single point in space could be the center of anything, but it's not until there's another dot there that you can go douchebag.
280500	296500	What is three feet from their wooden garbage cubby in their sea of zen gravel that is different from everyone else who just has Los Angeles distributed grass?
297500	310500	This is where I wish, in the future, I could throw up a feed. I took a photo, but we'd be excluding you guys and only including these assholes who paid money for the feed.
310500	316500	But they paid twice as much as you do each week. You guys pay $5 a month.
316500	319500	Can we not put a photo in after we're done tonight and put this in for us?
319500	323500	I'll try to remember to put it on my Instagram or something, but I'm just going to describe it to you.
324500	331500	It's like this little decoration. It's a little two-dimensional decoration that was store-bought.
331500	344500	It's plastic, and it's an image about this big. I'm holding up my hands. It's eight inches. At least I hope that's what eight inches is.
345500	358500	I'm tired of worrying about it. I don't know if my first hand is at the base or at the taints, but it's fucking about eight inches.
358500	361500	All right. I can't stand it anymore. I'm 42. I give up.
361500	365500	What would your ideal penis length be if I was a genie in a lab?
365500	367500	This is not the time for that.
368500	373500	Eight inches. Everyone says eight inches. I don't know what eight inches is. I don't know what that means.
373500	379500	I don't know if mine's four inches. I don't know if it's two. I know it's not ten.
381500	383500	Back to the story.
385500	387500	No tangents tonight.
388500	396500	It's this small little plastic, flat two-dimensional. It's just a flat thing. It's not a sculpture.
396500	406500	It's like a plastic, almost like a day-glow plastic. If it was nighttime, you might imagine that it would glow in the dark.
406500	412500	It probably wouldn't, but I'm saying imagine that kind of plastic, something that a glow-in-the-dark Frisbee would be made out of.
413500	426500	Just cheap plastic, but bought in some store. It's an outline of a dog squatting to poop.
426500	432500	Underneath the dog squatting, it's got a little post so you can stick it somewhere.
433500	439500	This was made by some asshole and put on a rack four assholes at an asshole store.
439500	445500	This asshole bought it, and it's designed to do this, to stick in an area.
445500	449500	It's a dog pooping, and underneath the dog it says, no!
451500	460500	Translation, yes, the city of Los Angeles has seen fit to gather together and implement leash laws and doggy-do laws.
460500	466500	But what's good for the goose is not good for the gander. My area outside my home is so fucking special,
466500	470500	that in spite of the fact that you have to walk around with a pile of plastic bags,
470500	475500	and that if you don't have your dog on a leash, the police can come and yell at you and give you a ticket.
475500	481500	We have seen to this as a state and city of animal lovers, but in spite of all of that,
481500	488500	this person would like you, if your dog decides to start relieving itself near their beautiful home,
488500	494500	you just yank that little fucker down to the next fuckface's house and let him shit in the inferior person's lawn,
494500	498500	because they don't want shit ever touching their zen gravel.
498500	503500	No! Not here! Because there's not signs everywhere.
503500	508500	We don't live in a world where there's no laws, so you have to put a sign if you don't.
508500	514500	Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like dog shit? We love it! We love it! We all love dog shit!
515500	518500	So we love dog shit?
520500	524500	I love dog shit, is what you're saying to me.
524500	530500	By exclusion, I have a sign over my head with a dog shitting on it that says,
530500	534500	Yes! I love dog shit!
534500	538500	But you're special, because your garbage is in a fucking log cabin.
539500	546500	You can't wait to get enough money to get in a helicopter and get the fuck away from who!
548500	552500	Who are you going to live with? Giraffes? They shit everywhere!
552500	558500	You live in King's Landing! This is as sophisticated as it gets, motherfucker!
558500	564500	Your garbage is on the curb! There's dog poop everywhere!
565500	572500	For the five seconds before the owner is legally compelled to scoop it up into a fucking hot bag
572500	579500	and put it into their silk line pocket. Jerry Bruckheimer has to clean up his assistant, probably does.
581500	584500	We are conscientious about this.
584500	591500	Can we ask our very talented and creative Harmon Town audience to make you an equal plastic sign
591500	597500	with a picture of you and Aaron with a dog pooping into your mouths and saying, Yes!
600500	604500	I just want to make one that says, Maybe!
604500	610500	You never know! Because the alternative is, I'm going to scar my dog's memory.
610500	618500	Dogs only do three things. We just finished successfully, Aaron just finished successfully potty training our new grief dog.
618500	627500	It's a really hard process and you're so excited the day your dog, like this little puppy goes out the doggy door and you watch him,
627500	629500	and he's like, There he goes! There he goes! There's a big boy!
629500	639500	And he knows to make it outside. The idea that I'd be taking a walk with my dog and he would stop in that forbidden zone.
639500	647500	And then I would be like, Well, that this person would have me feel bad that my dog chose there instead of eight feet away.
648500	652500	What a bad person. They made that garbage hutch for bad reasons.
655500	660500	They probably, I'll tell you, now I'm comfortable saying, because of that little dog sign,
660500	666500	the reason for the garbage hutch is because they think, they see like the Skeksi that come and pick through the garbage.
666500	670500	They don't like those people. Who's that? What's that guy doing down there?
670500	676500	That guy's like trying not to panhandle. That guy's like picking through your shit and like pulling out aluminum cans from,
677500	681500	and they're like, I don't know. What's he doing down there? Let's build a force field.
682500	684500	Around our garbage!
689500	691500	Protect the garbage!
694500	698500	Protect the garbage! They're gonna get the garbage!
699500	708500	I told you, but remember my neighbor, we called him ethnics because he was, he actually turned into kind of a fun guy.
708500	710500	It was ethnics with an X at the end.
713500	716500	But he's, I'm sure I've told this story, but he would,
716500	718500	We haven't talked about ethnics in a good long time.
718500	723500	I had a light bulb outside my apartment door and it was often, it was always like off and it was like,
723500	726500	What the fuck's with the light bulb? And he came over one time and said,
726500	736500	By the way, apologies about your porch light. I unscrew it at night because when the light is on, the children next door play.
744500	751500	When the light is, I'm not making that up. He said, when the light is on, the children play.
751500	754500	I like to steal the sunlight.
755500	758500	The sunlight brings the children joy.
759500	765500	He was called ethnics because he referred to the people that weren't white in the neighborhood as the ethnics.
765500	767500	But he was kind of ethnic himself.
767500	770500	He was certainly like, yeah.
770500	771500	He had some swarth.
771500	777500	If whiteness was his idol, like, yeah, he was a naughty boy.
778500	785500	That brings the racist out in me when like, you know, when racist people are like proud of their race.
785500	788500	And I'm like, well, you know, okay.
792500	794500	All right, buddy.
796500	799500	All right. Anyways, what's that?
799500	801500	Okay. I was trying to turn on my thing.
801500	803500	So I got, I got really fired up about that.
803500	806500	I just, all I wrote is doggy no sign. I didn't know it was that mad.
807500	809500	I wonder what I would love to go.
809500	816500	And I also hate to go inside their home because, you know, there would be lots of lots of rules, man.
816500	817500	Yeah.
817500	819500	There'd be lots of post-it notes for the housekeeper and stuff like that.
819500	822500	Have you been to passive aggressive notes dot com?
822500	823500	Is that is that still a thing?
823500	824500	Passive aggressive notes.
824500	825500	I like the sound of it.
825500	826500	That's so great.
826500	827500	Yeah. It's a total rabbit hole.
827500	835500	Like it just like class because it's just it's every every time at the office or an apartment building, you know, people that leave.
835500	836500	I've been one of these people.
836500	838500	I think we all have as part of the appeal of it.
838500	852500	It's like this grody part of you that at one time in your life, at some point you've left like a weird long note to strangers like or a roommate like kind of like just like and you're just in a weird time in your life or you haven't learned shame yet or you.
854500	864500	It's just like, you know, sometimes you just see these notes like when you remove the clothes from the dryer, make sure the lint trap is clean and we don't have your lint getting into our lint.
865500	870500	It's just like this diatribe and it's just like so much intensity.
870500	875500	I got a note on my car one time and I was it wasn't my best parking job of all time, but it was it was the best I could do.
875500	882500	And I'm a firm believer that like I'll get out of my car and look and if I can use like less space, I'll back it up to the very edge of the curb.
882500	885500	Like I use all the space I can one time I didn't.
885500	891500	And I got a note that was clearly a copy like this person had a stack of those notes.
892500	900500	It was a formula to gentlemen or madam like it was it was like that person just goes around.
900500	905500	Yeah. And I kind of dig it because I like what do you want. I want better parking.
905500	912500	I want I want people to use the space, but but also don't have a fucking box full of the idea.
912500	920500	The idea that what's standing between you and happiness is other people is like it's like something that all of the assholes that never have to interact with you because they don't.
921500	924500	They paid enough money to not have to. They're laughing all the way to the bank.
924500	929500	Well, you and I are sitting there going like, um, could you please put your left shoe where the right shoe goes?
929500	933500	Because otherwise the thing won't go across the divider and it's very irritating.
936500	938500	They've got us trained to police ourselves.
938500	941500	Well, the cops I have a guy I don't know where he lives.
941500	949500	I do know that when about two years ago, maybe more, I just kept hearing it's strange hours of the night and the day.
950500	952500	Distant clarinet noodling.
954500	956500	OK, some somebody's got a clarinet.
956500	964500	They're learning maybe that maybe there's a kid taking clarinet lessons and but it was kind of klezmery like kind of fiddle around the roofy like it was going to.
973500	976500	And you could never fucking figure it out and then you could hear it moving.
976500	978500	Somebody's walking the streets.
978500	980500	It's fucking three a.m.
980500	987500	I would turn all the lights out and look but my there's not enough street light on my street and I would see a figure like a Sasquatch going by.
987500	991500	I see a huddled like just a silhouette going by.
994500	1005500	So now what he's done, he's taken up in a red SUV and he parks on my street every three days, which I take to mean he has other streets he goes to.
1007500	1010500	He's scattering that out and spreading it out like.
1010500	1015500	And I've always heard it and like just all of a sudden I'd be a.
1015500	1024500	And so he parks right behind my office window of my place and I heard a jogger come to the street and go, you know, like look, there's some guy went to his window.
1024500	1026500	A jogger came to his window.
1026500	1027500	He just is in the car.
1027500	1030500	And I think my guess is he has a wife or a roommate or something like that.
1030500	1032500	He's an older guy with gray hair.
1032500	1036500	Also, the clarinet has awesome like Steven Tyler ribbons hanging out.
1036500	1038500	Wait, now he's not a silhouette.
1038500	1040500	You know, I see I've caught him in the daylight.
1040500	1041500	I've seen him in the daylight.
1041500	1044500	But I tried to get the phone out and get footage, but he just evaporates.
1044500	1047500	He's like he's a mystical, a mystical being.
1047500	1050500	And now he sits across the street from my place and I can see him from my window.
1050500	1052500	But there's just enough reflection off the glass today.
1052500	1055500	I can't I can't get an image of him.
1055500	1058500	And what if it what if what if it turned out to be old you.
1062500	1065500	What if you what if you took a picture and it was like there is a reflection and
1065500	1069500	you took it to like a detective and he's like enhance, enhance, enhance.
1069500	1073500	And it was like fucking you with like a long gray hair.
1073500	1078500	And the clarinet had like futuristic like microchips on it or something.
1078500	1082500	I he's certainly that mythological.
1082500	1083500	So I have these new neighbors.
1083500	1084500	They're like they came in.
1084500	1085500	They're from England.
1085500	1091500	She's like, do you do you frequently hear clarinet playing or am I
1091500	1092500	going mad?
1092500	1095500	I'm like, no, like look across the street in the red SUV.
1095500	1096500	It's so good.
1096500	1100500	I don't want him to go away, but there's a jogger came up and completely just gave him
1100500	1101500	shit.
1101500	1102500	Like I think he lives nearby.
1102500	1106500	I think he's pretending this guy was like a jockey kind of guy.
1106500	1108500	I think he pretended to go jogging.
1108500	1114500	I think he lives right there and then like like went way around and jogged up to him.
1114500	1116500	Oh, I live way across town.
1116500	1119500	But weird playing clarinet all the time.
1119500	1121500	I wanted to go shoot that guy.
1121500	1125500	Yeah, I lived in my first one bedroom apartment in Hollywood.
1125500	1128500	The guy right next door to me was like definite.
1128500	1129500	I'm not exaggerating.
1129500	1134500	He was morbidly obese, like by the legal definitions because you would have like there was a van
1134500	1146500	that would come pick him up whenever I had to go eat or teach physics.
1146500	1148500	I don't want to get all PJ O'Rourke about it.
1148500	1158500	I'm not going to assume he was on the dole, but it seemed to me because for a year I listened
1158500	1160500	to him and he was this amazing voice.
1160500	1161500	He was like an opera singer.
1161500	1165500	Every once in a while he'd have somebody over that obviously had fallen for some kind of
1165500	1166500	singing lesson thing.
1166500	1167500	So he was like teaching people to sing.
1167500	1169500	He has this amazing voice.
1169500	1171500	He was like this.
1171500	1174500	He would like sing opera at the top of his lungs.
1174500	1176500	I was like, oh, this is like a Robert Altman film.
1176500	1178500	There's an opera singer next door to me.
1178500	1182500	I would tune it out and then every once in a while he would yell at the handicap van because
1182500	1183500	they were late.
1183500	1186500	He had this rage-a-hall-ism thing.
1186500	1193500	He was not a perfect guy to live next door, but at least let's say a year went by that
1193500	1194500	I lived in that place.
1194500	1196500	I was like, oh, that guy does that.
1196500	1200500	Singing like South Pacific and stuff.
1200500	1205500	You just hear weird snatches of South Pacific or West Side Story or something.
1205500	1206500	Really good voice.
1206500	1209500	I think it might have been different if he wasn't a good singer.
1209500	1215500	Then one day just up from upstairs in the six-unit building and just after 20 minutes
1215500	1223500	of him after a year of this and then all of a sudden upstairs you just hear, shut up,
1223500	1226500	you fat bastard.
1226500	1231500	It was a Scottish guy which distracts you because it's the Mike Myers reference.
1232500	1234500	I remember the guy said, you fat bastard.
1234500	1237500	He had a Scottish accent and lived upstairs.
1237500	1242500	Then the guy just immediately went silent and I never heard him again.
1242500	1245500	He is a fat bastard.
1245500	1251500	I just want to say this about that.
1251500	1254500	You live in an apartment building.
1254500	1255500	Guess what?
1255500	1256500	You live with other people.
1256500	1261500	Clomp, clomp, clomp and the Tuesday night she does this and the Wednesday night he
1261500	1266500	vacuums and this guy is a serial killer or this guy snips your laundry.
1266500	1268500	It's called living with other people.
1268500	1273500	It's a thing that they have done to us as part of a class system.
1273500	1277500	When you're poor you share property with other people that you don't even own.
1277500	1283500	What would be a really dangerous thing to happen in that case?
1283500	1287500	Everybody getting along but they call them apartments.
1287500	1291500	Think about it.
1291500	1296500	Everyone just sits there for 30 years of their life trying to act like their goal is to turn
1296500	1302500	their life into Hugh Hefner's life even though they're still living in a fucking building
1302500	1304500	that they share with a bunch of poor people.
1304500	1307500	It's because we're so trained to hate each other for being poor.
1307500	1310500	When you put your chocolate bars on the thing, this is your neighbor.
1310500	1314500	This is your closer person than your family.
1314500	1318500	Buy a house, motherfucker, which is what we all want to do.
1318500	1322500	We all can't wait to get behind some big gate with a heart to heart logo on it and just
1322500	1324500	sit up there and fuck it.
1324500	1329500	That's when you go insane and you end up abducting women and keeping them prisoner.
1329500	1332500	Building cedar enclosures for your trash cans.
1332500	1334500	The truth is that this is life.
1334500	1337500	The guy that's stomping above you, that's it.
1337500	1340500	That's it.
1340500	1343500	This is your family.
1343500	1346500	This is your life.
1346500	1348500	I'm not saying you have to love it.
1348500	1354500	I'm just saying by the time you don't have it anymore, you're going to be powerless against it.
1354500	1357500	You're going to be powerless against anything that actually makes you unhappy,
1357500	1360500	which is the fucking landlord who's collecting your rent.
1360500	1362500	He lives by himself.
1362500	1364500	I just wanted to make one point.
1364500	1367500	I'm going to cut off my lawn episode of Harman Town.
1367500	1371500	Aaron and I were talking about dicks on the way over here because there's a guy in England
1371500	1374500	who's drawing dicks next to potholes.
1374500	1378500	They're calling him wanksy.
1378500	1383500	But then the potholes get filled because in England, I guess a penis on the street is like,
1383500	1386500	oh, they fill up the pothole.
1386500	1388500	In England that works.
1388500	1390500	I don't know if it'll work in L.A.
1391500	1396500	At least it would have to be a swastika made of dicks.
1396500	1398500	Or vice versa.
1398500	1402500	And Aaron said, why don't you ever see a swastika made of dicks?
1402500	1408500	And I said, I guess because you're usually in two different moods.
1408500	1412500	They really are far removed.
1412500	1415500	It's like the doodling and anything's a dick.
1415500	1423500	And then there's that urge to, you know, assemble the Rhineland and conquer all of humanity.
1423500	1425500	You're just never in the same mood at the same time.
1425500	1428500	Hitler wasn't like, I love dicks.
1428500	1434500	I'm almost certain if you Google right now swastika made of dicks or dicks made of swastikas or whatever,
1434500	1436500	there's images of that.
1436500	1437500	Just dicks swastika.
1437500	1438500	Yes, of course.
1438500	1439500	There'll be like 500 of them.
1439500	1441500	I just thought we were both very funny in the car right over here.
1441500	1443500	That's all.
1443500	1446500	So is our friend here?
1446500	1447500	Did he ever pop by?
1447500	1450500	Do any of our friends here?
1450500	1455500	Well, Curtis said he was coming tonight is why I'm asking.
1455500	1457500	Do we have Curtis in the house?
1457500	1459500	No, Curtis.
1459500	1461500	Sorry, everybody.
1461500	1463500	He usually pops by around nine.
1463500	1464500	All right.
1464500	1465500	Delight deferred.
1465500	1466500	Okay.
1466500	1475500	Well, I'm wearing my I'm wearing my colors for my my wife's basketball team tonight.
1475500	1479500	The Lisa's, which is designed by where is Hannah's now.
1479500	1482500	She's usually she's in the front row.
1482500	1486500	Hannah Hannah Nance, our longtime Armenian and brilliant graphic designer,
1486500	1487500	designed these shirts.
1487500	1491500	And she's also doing the illustration for Emily Gordon's book.
1491500	1493500	I'm just putting a string around my finger.
1493500	1495500	We should have Emily Gordon on the show.
1496500	1501500	We are wasting like somebody that should have been on the show a long time ago, I think she'd be fast.
1501500	1508500	She's almost a victim of like how close she is to the because it was literally her idea for me to do the podcast.
1508500	1511500	Like like she she suggested it.
1511500	1515500	It's like so whenever I see her in the email, she's always just going like, do you have any names for the guest list?
1515500	1519500	And I just like think of but never thinking like, oh, Emily Gordon would be an amazing.
1519500	1520500	Why don't you say next week?
1520500	1521500	Let's have her on.
1521500	1523500	We're going to be in Portland, right?
1523500	1524500	I think next week we're in Portland.
1524500	1525500	Maybe she will be too.
1525500	1526500	We'll see.
1526500	1527500	Well, Steve Levy.
1527500	1528500	Are you here?
1528500	1529500	Put it on.
1529500	1530500	Put put Emily Gordon on your list.
1530500	1534500	Put put Andy Kindler on your list.
1534500	1535500	P.J. O'Rourke.
1538500	1540500	I'm going to start doing like a regular podcast having Steve Levy.
1540500	1541500	Andy Kindler.
1541500	1542500	I fucking love it.
1542500	1543500	Andy Kindler is a funny guy.
1543500	1544500	My applause.
1544500	1545500	Who knows Andy Kindler?
1545500	1546500	Holy fuck.
1546500	1551500	I I've one of the funniest days of my life because that guy is so bloody fucking funny.
1551500	1554500	I for some reason he likes the Lakers or used to.
1554500	1559500	I sat next to him at his girlfriend's apartment up in the valley like many, many years ago.
1559500	1568500	And he I watched him watch a Laker game and it was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life because he's a stand up comic who's just giving the Lakers shit.
1568500	1570500	He's he's tremendously funny.
1570500	1575500	He's a he's a he's a he's a he's an L.A. treasure as funnier than any any.
1575500	1579500	If you see him do stand up, he's like he's I saw him do show in time.
1579500	1590500	He was going to what's the Aspen like the big thing there with the comics going like I guess was Aspen right there in the old days when there was a thing called a holding deals and development deals for actors.
1590500	1591500	That's all gone away.
1591500	1595500	I'm not sure like Steve Buscemi or bigger like they used to give like up and coming comics.
1595500	1597500	There's you know five hundred thousand dollars to go.
1597500	1598500	Don't go to ABC.
1598500	1601500	You you work for CBS and we're going to put you on a show.
1601500	1603500	And if we don't you still get half a million dollars.
1603500	1616500	So the big back when every comic was getting shows like you Ray Romano's and Drew Carey's and stuff like that and then way after that there was he was doing a show at IGB's which is a comedy club I think that's gone now on the west side.
1616500	1619500	And they told him do your set.
1619500	1620500	Do not riff.
1620500	1621500	Do not go off script.
1621500	1623500	Just it's all the top brass.
1623500	1629500	All the big companies and networks are going to be at your show and you're going to go to ask me to just do your thing.
1630500	1634500	And he made a reference that someone goes like what's that.
1634500	1649500	Someone just yelled out what I didn't get the reference and he never got back to his material and absolutely crucified the entire audience because they were west side tight asses and didn't fucking dig it and right wing and he fucking just laid it on him.
1649500	1653500	And then he goes like I forget momentum.
1653500	1655500	Forget my forget forward progress.
1655500	1662500	Madam any time you don't understand anything I say please or anybody just just just just just pipe in and ask me what that means.
1662500	1676500	I need to see you at a Dennis Miller concert and then he did 40 minutes on he hates Dennis Miller and the crowd was it was abject silence except for the seven comics in the back of the room who were losing our minds.
1677500	1690500	The phrase comics comic I mean he really is like like like somehow I don't know if you'd be offended by by me saying this he jokes about it all the time but like like I think it's notable about his career.
1690500	1705500	The I put heavy air quotes around the word success very heavy air quotes because that's the point of his existence that's proven out is like but you would say at a glance success eludes him like like as in he hasn't had a shitty sitcom yet.
1705500	1712500	He hasn't he hasn't like he hasn't embarrassed himself grappling for an attempt to be one of those household names.
1712500	1715500	He just I don't know if it's because of that's why I want to talk to him.
1715500	1717500	I don't know if that's if it's his own choice.
1717500	1719500	I don't know if he's if he sabotages himself.
1719500	1730500	I don't know if unconsciously that's nobility or if there's or if it's just happy coincidence that he's I don't know if he's like if it never if that opportunity never comes to him.
1730500	1748500	If Andy had his way he would be you know in on TV and in movies get like guaranteed but like like he's just he's so funny you do a thing about the just for laughs in Montreal where he would do a giant giant show called the state of the industry address and he would just talk about what's being picked up and what's not.
1749500	1751500	I just I think there's always this interstate.
1751500	1756500	I'm always talking about like I hate this like institutionalized comedy console but comedy is very popular now.
1756500	1770500	So it's like and I'm sorry I'm going to slit my own throat by saying sometimes when I see ads for Jimmy Fallon with a with a with a with a politician who's going to come out and play tug of war with him like I I'm just like this isn't this isn't comedy's role in the world.
1770500	1772500	This is not what we're supposed to be doing.
1772500	1783500	How do how do I even know what we're doing is funny anymore if the ideas should be hosted by people such as Andy Kindler and Jeremy Cramer and Greg Proops and comedy should always be separate from from success.
1783500	1786500	It should always be separate from politics.
1786500	1788500	It should always be profane.
1788500	1790500	It should always be the other thing.
1790500	1798500	It should because otherwise you cannot guarantee that it's funny and you that is funny as it could be and you cannot like it.
1798500	1800500	It's I don't know.
1800500	1802500	I'm always like ranting about this behind closed doors.
1802500	1817500	I feel like it's actually like career suicide for me to like you know I can't I can't even fully like talk about it because I would say so much shit that it would just people already don't like me but I just like I just think comedy doesn't have to be dark and it doesn't have to be toxic.
1817500	1822500	It doesn't have to be hateful but it has to be it has to be suspicious of authority.
1822500	1824500	It has to hate everything that's popular.
1824500	1837500	It cannot just come out and say this popular things coming out but what if this popular thing played peekaboo with me peekaboo that can't be comedy that cannot be comedy.
1837500	1841500	There's no way that does that just doesn't make any sense to me.
1841500	1853500	And so I think I feel like Andy kind of represents like the intersection of those roads where you get some investigation done because he is truly funny and it seems like the reason all comics love him and like all always kind of trust him.
1853500	1869500	And fear him and and why he's never able like like he never shoots up and rings the dumbbell you know like at the carnival where it's like Andy Kindler in the W B's just talk about daddy's like like it never gets to that point.
1869500	1880500	I have a feeling it's because he's too like whether it's it's genetic or unconscious or by choice he's too he's too committed to being funny and it won't allow for that.
1880500	1886500	Like you couldn't put Bill Hicks in a suit. There's not a drawer that he goes right into like on TV and stuff like that.
1886500	1891500	But I oversold him so now I'll come on the show and I'll be like he's just going to yell at you guys for being young. That's what I do too.
1891500	1894500	There was an amazing show many many many years ago.
1894500	1899500	It was all the the the indie comics like mostly San Francisco people.
1899500	1905500	It was called Hacks Hacks Hacks and they all everyone came up and did their favorite hack style of comedy.
1905500	1915500	Like Dave Anthony came out as the as the fat comic. He only talked about how fat he was like he stuffed his shirt and his name was Joey Sandwiches.
1915500	1921500	And the immortal and wonderful and passed away sadly Warren Thomas is one of the greatest comics of all time.
1921500	1925500	He did the hack death comedy jam comic and it was fucking magical.
1925500	1929500	And Andy Kindler did the most abstruse one and I think it stole the whole show.
1929500	1935500	He was the the logic comic like the comics to do and I won't say names just people that still do this.
1935500	1942500	It's my least favorite kind of stand up or there's a guy or there's a woman and it lives on my block.
1942500	1949500	And every time I get my car and she's she smells like piss and she knocks in my window and I say to her mom that kind of thing.
1949500	1951500	They turn the tables kind of at the end.
1951500	1957500	So he would he had fake. He had like Janine Garofalo in the audience like planted as a heckler.
1957500	1967500	You suck. Madam Madam I don't come down to where you work and knock the painting off the easel when you're creating a delicate masterpiece.
1967500	1972500	Only for comments. God damn it's funny.
1972500	1981500	He did. There was a woman lives in my house. She raised my siblings and I and she she fed us and she put us through college.
1981500	1992500	And one day I said to her mom. And that and that and that was in the living room.
1992500	1997500	Only for comics. Everybody was shitting their pants.
1997500	2001500	I worship Bandy Kindler. We have to have him on the show. Yeah yeah we'll have a month.
2001500	2009500	I also he's he's also he's always he's on Twitter and he's you wouldn't think this about him but not an atheist like he's always getting yelled at by atheists.
2010500	2020500	And so sometimes I'll like I'll like I'll like jump in like because he's like like he's like he's like getting drawn into some like like like weird thing with like atheist kids who are like you're smart.
2020500	2025500	You shouldn't believe in God and all this stuff and like like I don't know he's getting these dumb fights with dumb people.
2027500	2028500	All right. So.
2029500	2030500	Oh.
2035500	2036500	Ring tingle into.
2045500	2047500	We have some sort of exotic animal back.
2052500	2054500	That was the first time that guy ever laughed in his life.
2059500	2060500	He never.
2061500	2062500	He's like Sam the eagle at work.
2063500	2065500	I said do you have those files.
2066500	2069500	I don't know but I got a dildo and he's like put that away. You're fired.
2071500	2075500	And he's just like walking around. He's just like I don't see the humor of this.
2076500	2079500	There's a fire hydrant that's painted red white and blue for Fourth of July.
2079500	2081500	He's like that's vandalism. I'm calling the police.
2082500	2086500	And then he came here tonight and it was something about the frequencies.
2088500	2089500	Oh.
2095500	2100500	And now he's going to go home and like rip off his tie and dump Angelica Houston who's playing his wife.
2103500	2106500	Whose father owns his company so it's OK.
2107500	2115500	You know that whenever you need a male hero in a movie to like leave to like be free and like leave his like like wife is always has to be like her father owns the company.
2116500	2119500	So that he so that he's not like a bad bad guy.
2123500	2125500	And by the way we're not shaming that laugh we're celebrating.
2126500	2127500	Of course.
2128500	2131500	Everyone should laugh that that that heartily careful.
2134500	2136500	We used to think the rules were that simple.
2138500	2140500	If we find out someone's doing a fake laugh in here.
2141500	2143500	I mean what about that one guy. Where is he.
2144500	2145500	Is it right there.
2146500	2147500	Is it.
2147500	2148500	Isn't the fake laugh.
2148500	2149500	No no I'm saying it's not fake.
2149500	2153500	He his true laugh like when one week was like the bane of everyone's.
2154500	2157500	He got he got a little too high and he was just like a laugh.
2158500	2160500	I love people that snort and snorkeling.
2161500	2162500	I like I like that laugh.
2163500	2164500	I heard a snorkel earlier.
2164500	2165500	Somebody out there does it.
2165500	2166500	Who does it.
2167500	2168500	I wasn't pointing at you.
2169500	2170500	Well let's.
2170500	2171500	She hasn't been here in a couple of weeks.
2171500	2172500	Let's bring up my other half.
2172500	2173500	Aaron McGathey.
2191500	2192500	Thank you for having me.
2192500	2195500	Thanks for wearing my basketball team's t-shirt.
2196500	2197500	How's it going.
2197500	2198500	Playing basketball.
2198500	2202500	Can you guess our record.
2202500	2204500	We've played three games.
2205500	2206500	You won.
2206500	2207500	You won all.
2207500	2208500	I know the record so I won't guess.
2209500	2211500	We are three for three in spirit.
2214500	2217500	And in kindness and we have a mascot.
2217500	2220500	We're the only team in the league that has a mascot.
2222500	2223500	But we have not won a game.
2223500	2225500	But we look up Willie Roberts.
2225500	2227500	He plays teamwork the unicorn.
2227500	2228500	And it's really good.
2230500	2231500	I'm having a difficult time.
2232500	2238500	What could be more supportable than your wife playing a local sports league.
2239500	2240500	How many games have you been to Dan.
2240500	2241500	I haven't been to any of them.
2243500	2244500	She's been working on community.
2244500	2248500	She comes home from practice and it's like so not only am I not I'm not supportive enough
2248500	2252500	but now she's coming in like sweating and the headband and the shoes.
2252500	2254500	And I punch a wall when I walk in.
2255500	2258500	And then it's like as always you know there's a couple of Minecraft jokes because I'm always
2258500	2259500	playing Minecraft.
2259500	2262500	And it's like well now you have to step back and look at yourself.
2262500	2263500	You're just a jock.
2267500	2268500	I don't know if that's fair.
2268500	2274500	You're not just like the wife laying in wait for me to get you know like like like like
2274500	2275500	they love you.
2275500	2279500	You're like this lady coming home and going like yeah I got a three pointer.
2279500	2280500	The fuck why don't you pick some more.
2280500	2282500	Are you strong enough to hug me.
2285500	2286500	Yeah I.
2286500	2289500	You're still sitting there playing a game bro.
2291500	2293500	That game's not going to get you laid.
2296500	2298500	Is there a pussy in that game.
2298500	2299500	Can you craft a pussy.
2304500	2307500	I mean I believe I said can you craft a deck but it's fine.
2307500	2319500	I didn't mention you were you were talking about the the trash bin cubbies and you explained
2319500	2320500	my my theory.
2320500	2324500	I might my shame and I don't think I mentioned this.
2324500	2328500	I saw that sign and I just kept it quiet because I was like oh no they're bad people.
2332500	2336500	I'm stubborn and I don't want to lose that argument but I thought that I was like hopefully
2336500	2340500	you never see that but obviously those are shitty people.
2340500	2344500	I mean why was it an argument like like I was like like these guys are bad guys.
2344500	2347500	They got a aggressive about the Minecraft thing.
2347500	2348500	That's what it is.
2348500	2349500	It comes down.
2350500	2354500	You didn't want to lose an opportunity to say some people craft things in real life.
2355500	2357500	And then I would have been like yeah these kinds of people.
2358500	2363500	Because I have this I have this aching of this aching womb that wants you to build things.
2366500	2369500	Like it like in it or around it.
2370500	2374500	I mean I'm joking but I I'm joking but I love the reaction that I got.
2376500	2379500	You want him to craft maybe a baby.
2379500	2385500	Yeah make a make a make a baby in me make a crib around me make you show me.
2387500	2388500	We're in trouble.
2388500	2390500	I don't think either of us knows what we're doing.
2390500	2398500	No I would not let anything I cared about sleep and anything you made in real life.
2399500	2402500	No but I'm saying like we're supposed to build a crib around you.
2404500	2406500	We can't get out to raise our child.
2408500	2416500	I just want to look like I'm excited because like like what the door on the back door can be smaller right to let the baby go out and like.
2421500	2422500	Yeah that's how it will work.
2422500	2425500	But yeah the Lisa's basketball Tuesdays.
2426500	2427500	What was it what's the big.
2429500	2432500	Because Kate my ex-girlfriend is on the team and she she's great.
2432500	2433500	Her nickname is squirrel.
2433500	2436500	We all have animal nicknames because there's a whole mythology about our team.
2437500	2444500	We're from a land of magical animals that live that lived peacefully for a very long time.
2445500	2463500	Until one day our our core animal this unicorn was kidnapped by a dark force and we were told we would not get this unicorn back until we could prove that we could live with compassion and sensitivity and teamwork as a women's basketball team.
2463500	2476500	So there's a lot more at stake for us and so far we will never get our unicorn back because we are.
2478500	2483500	It's her perfect cynical tea up for me to say sounds like the other teams were practicing their zones.
2483500	2493500	Well I mean you guys were writing workshops literally literally the other team is doing that while I had a stump that we were passing around and smelling talking about.
2495500	2500500	How many do people show up to watch the games like you have a lot of followers and supporters.
2501500	2507500	I mean it's hard to say who's a supporter and who's just taking a break from their game.
2508500	2509500	When's your next game we should all go.
2509500	2513500	You all should go. Our next games are always on Tuesday nights right.
2514500	2527500	They're always on Tuesday nights. I will post an Instagram of our schedule. Our next game is in North Hollywood and I believe at nine o'clock and we're playing a team that I don't know loves Hitler I can't remember.
2528500	2533500	There are some funny team names one of them is the princess layups. Yeah there's the princess layups.
2534500	2541500	Yeah there's the cream of dual jababes. There's the badunka dunks. Yeah.
2542500	2555500	Also the L.A. nail clippers is very good. They're all they're all amazing. It's a great it's a it's really it's really fun. It's a really fun thing to be a part of like all these all these women who like haven't played sports before.
2556500	2576500	The free throw ups. They're all super thin. So you should see them. See what I can think of. Only dots I can connect. Yeah I'm doing great except I was I don't know if I told you this I was taken out of most of the game that we played on Tuesday because I hit a girl on the face twice.
2577500	2599500	Why are you cheering that. Why are you cheering the same girl twice. I hit in the face and she was so great. Was there some was there some conscious rage against this girl or was it just no coincidental. No it was coincidental. I mean my limbs are like I don't know if anybody feels connected to their arms but to me it's like well I tied some kites to my torso and they'll do what they will.
2599500	2621500	So you were kicked out for fouling out. My coach my coach who I co-host a podcast with human conversation new podcast. So I thought he was we were we recorded a podcast earlier in the day. Wayne Fetterman and I was a little testy towards him during the podcast.
2621500	2644500	So I thought he was taking that out on me because it happened twice where he said to the bench. All right everybody in except Aaron twice he said that where I was like well wait. Before you started assaulting women in the face. No no no this is this is after because he explained to me later like no no no they're great at free throws because every time you hit somebody there's a consequence.
2644500	2668500	That is a life lesson. Yeah it's not just that it hurts them it's that they can parlay it into points. Finally that's how to get through to you. And I didn't I didn't mean to do it obviously maybe not obviously but I didn't mean to do it. So he was keeping me out of the game so I didn't ruin the game for us by hitting people.
2669500	2676500	You struck a nerve when you talked about your your limbs like in your lack of control over him. I just I.
2678500	2680500	Guys everybody just let's all leave.
2682500	2687500	I married this woman that I just like I I I just.
2688500	2690500	You can be about hand jobs.
2692500	2697500	I know that like like like I just like you're so like.
2700500	2702500	Majestic beautiful graceful.
2703500	2706500	You're so prone to.
2708500	2712500	Being a magical organic acts of.
2713500	2715500	What's the word you're looking for Dan.
2716500	2720500	You're you're not allowed to call women clumsy. It's not a.
2721500	2723500	You could call me clumsy.
2724500	2729500	You're you're you're like I'm so like I'm so scared.
2732500	2741500	I just like like like like because she's really handy and crafty and like like loves making things like like a great gift for her would be like a table saw but not.
2742500	2751500	Like I like I sometimes think like like oh I just you know there's like that space under the where the firewood is there's a little workshop the guy that used to own the house.
2752500	2759500	Used to make airplanes down there. Oh Aaron could have a little wood shop or she could make bird feeders but I won't. I can't do it.
2760500	2771500	I can't I can't I can't I just I live in terror that even the even the even the just a regular cabinet door or just a just a normal day alive like I just I just live.
2772500	2773500	I just I just.
2774500	2781500	Because I told you about hanging out the window to hang the bird feeder it's always it's nonstop you're always like falling and like like like like.
2781500	2793500	I just like I just so like I like I if I if I if I if I just can't I can't say the words out loud.
2794500	2806500	It's okay every if you cut your finger off like I'm going to like I like like I and I'm not there and then I'm like like I can't I mean here's the thing.
2806500	2811500	Here's the thing every man in my life has had this exact same speech.
2815500	2824500	I mean it's not a joke that makes me feel better. I mean from my dad to my brother to ex ex lovers to princes.
2825500	2845500	I have heard this speech I do think statistically I will lose a finger at some point I think like I mean I have to but but hopefully won't be until later and when it happens I'll put it on ice and I'll make it like an afterthought and you'll one day I'll be cutting a cake and you'll be like whoa for and I'll say yes.
2845500	2860500	About a year ago I was I was making a bird feeder too quickly no I'll be careful Dan I'll be careful what was the scare with a bird feeder.
2860500	2878500	Oh I mean the problem is like the combination of my clutsiness with my impatience and I I thought it wise to hang out of our he was so upset about that.
2879500	2895500	I wanted to hang a bird feeder on a tree that was kind of near the second story window and I saw it so I almost fell out of the window as a thing I was like holding on to it with like one foot so I could hang up.
2895500	2913500	That's just the shit that she tells me about like I'm telling you like like like like when we were first going out like like I was it was like okay like I I'm not this is the one like I'm not trading it like for anything it's an it.
2913500	2934500	Like I'm exhausted but like it like you're like like the you know like you never did it again but then like there was a time I came home and like the oven was on and I was like you left the oven on and I'm like I just I didn't know that I had this like thing in me there I'm like oh God she's going to die she's going to die.
2934500	2960500	But I thought but I have like I mean I when I was when I was your age I I was I was like living my doors were windows were open and I was just in a sea of semen and junk mail and I just I I I was just I was on the Atkins diet so I would like try to charbroil burgers one day I came home and I woke up to the smell of burning kitchen and the kitchen was on fire and I put it out and fuck it.
2960500	2970500	So if anybody had loved me at that point they'd be very concerned. I promise you'll never find me in a sea of semen and junk mail.
2970500	2977500	Don't don't. Is that a challenge? Physical challenge. Physical challenge.
2977500	2995500	Oh hey our friend is here Curtis Armstrong get him out of here.
2995500	3003500	I came back. Curtis you were under the weather last week.
3003500	3006500	I was under the weather. Nothing would have kept me away other than that.
3006500	3014500	I hope that you're telling the truth. That's really. We still communicate through direct messages on Twitter. We haven't graduated to.
3014500	3026500	Well you know we want to take this slowly. What's really great about it is I came in here to publicize one time to publicize King of the Nerds. That's why I came here. Right.
3026500	3038500	Initially. And then you asked me to come back which I thought was really polite and so I thought I would come back and then the next thing I knew it was like I wanted to be here all the time.
3038500	3053500	Never leave us Curtis. Curtis. I don't want to be presumptuous and overstepped the bounds of courtesy or whatever. Dan and I knew each other.
3053500	3063500	When do we meet Harmon in 94 or something like that at a comedy sports festival in Milwaukee and we. We must have been two years old.
3063500	3074500	And then you and Schwab and Peter Alberts came to to L.A. and we would threaten to be friends. We would always said we should hang out and we should always talk and we'd see each other once in a while and we'd always said we're going to hang out.
3074500	3097500	It took us four years or more. It took a long time. Let's not let's not only communicate through direct messages on Twitter. No no you're right. And it's but I mean it is really a funny thing because you know I don't want to sound fulsome or anything but the truth is you've got something which is really nice to come to at the end of a week to come here and have all these people not a lot of people feel that way.
3097500	3123500	So if you feel that way then it's perfect. It's been it's been enjoyable for me. I'm glad to be back and all that. I'm leaving again but I'm. Where are you going back tonight. I'm going to England. To visit your daughter. I'm going to go. You're going to go to England but not visit your daughter. I'm going to tell her business. If she finds out I was there and didn't look her up she'll be pissed.
3124500	3133500	I just saw a still Alice with Julianne Moore. Oh yeah. She plays like a linguistics person. Oh yeah. I thought of your daughter. I know. I know. I also thought of your daughter when I was.
3134500	3151500	And the phrase thought of your daughter sounds to tease you up. But it's like I was going to ask has she seen that movie at which when I realized I'd become my grandmother. Yeah I don't know. What do I care. She took does she know anybody in that movie. Yeah.
3152500	3160500	All of those. Yeah. The linguistics people hang out. No she has. My daughter is studying linguistics. That's why we're talking about that.
3161500	3175500	But Jillianne Moore has a thing in the first act which they're establishing her as a linguist. She's giving a speech where she kind of like covers in a cursory fashion. Some of that shit that we were talking about when we first talked about your daughter when I was traveling about linguistic.
3175500	3186500	I know the fact that human beings have like this weird like we don't we don't we don't speak as a matter of learning it from other people. Yeah. But but and she she touches on that stuff but her character. Have you guys seen that movie.
3187500	3195500	It's really interesting. It's brutal. She saw it. There's one thing to applaud for enthusiastically.
3198500	3210500	Like I don't know if like I. Well whatever. I mean it's just I mean it's an interesting it's an interesting thing. And and I've I have learned about linguistics as a result of my daughter.
3210500	3219500	I don't even know where it came from. I mean this was not where I thought she was going. And then suddenly when a man loves a woman the man puts the penis in the vagina.
3220500	3235500	Oh sorry. No that's that's not linguistic. That's where your daughter came from. Oh that. Yes. You're right. Is your wife. Do you ever. Has your wife ever had a serious injury. You've been with her for all these.
3238500	3248500	She ever had a serious injury. Like she ever cut off her finger or broken a leg or. I don't think so. I'm worried about my health.
3249500	3270500	Why. Have you been having problems. I just got here. So I missed. I missed what was going on. I am naturally clumsy but also tenacious with my handiwork. She's very stubborn and impulsive and she'll decide like I think this hat should be on top of it.
3270500	3283500	That pile of razor blades like it does it. She never. She doesn't like stop. Like like like like remember when we were in that gay bar and like it was clear. It was so.
3284500	3285500	Yes.
3288500	3291500	There's this there's this there's this. They don't they have an announcement.
3291500	3308500	There was there was this bar in Hyperion and it's closed closed now. Akbar is closed. Oh the Akbar. I know that place. Yeah. I know that. They've got a piano in there and it's. Oh no. Oh you're talking with the the. Oh no. Not Akbar.
3308500	3326500	It was called the other side which is this great old gay piano bar. Now it's called Hyperion public. It was a fantastic place where mostly like you know like kind of show folkie gay guys and some women will go in there and sing show tunes and. Pardon.
3326500	3327500	Pardon.
3331500	3333500	It's an unrelated satanic.
3338500	3339500	What do you say. I'm so sorry.
3350500	3351500	Sorry young lady sorry.
3357500	3358500	Oh my God.
3360500	3361500	That was horrifying by the way.
3364500	3367500	Can you say. Can you say pizza with extra pepperoni.
3370500	3371500	Oh no.
3372500	3374500	Where are you from. I love your accent.
3374500	3375500	Switzerland.
3377500	3380500	I don't know how you say it but I. How do you say welcome.
3381500	3382500	Coming huh.
3385500	3388500	Say it's been eleven in your most ominous Swiss accent.
3393500	3396500	What what would you call. What would you call your accent.
3398500	3399500	Shitty.
3402500	3407500	All right. But we were right about Switzerland though right. Yeah. All right. So Dan and I are in a gay bar.
3408500	3411500	I mean this is just change. I'm just saying like here's the thing.
3412500	3416500	Like we're at this like like like like it was a it was a great place. It's change ownership now.
3417500	3419500	But it was like it was a great place to drink piano.
3420500	3425500	Like like like you know if you've been to one of these bars were like like it's like the gay guys go and they like they sang it's not karaoke.
3426500	3428500	Like they got to know their shit.
3429500	3436500	They're like competitive with each other and it's like super supportive and very fun and a lot of people are really bummed out when it closed down.
3437500	3441500	It was a great place. And it's not a place where you go. And I've I've fallen for it.
3442500	3446500	You should go up and sing Father Figure by George Michael. It's like you go up.
3447500	3449500	Like do you have the sheet music. I'll pull it up on my phone.
3450500	3454500	And they're like OK. I'll be your father figure.
3455500	3460500	Yeah. Sit down. It's not karaoke. It's like it's a different thing.
3461500	3466500	So you have to know the key. We went there with Aaron and I had been through that experience and we were having a good time.
3467500	3472500	And Aaron's like I'm going to say I want to sing a thing. And I'm like I'm just letting you know it doesn't work that way.
3473500	3476500	It's never going to work that way. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way.
3477500	3481500	It'll be terrible. You can't work that way. It won't happen that way. It can't work that way.
3482500	3485500	It's like I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it anyway. And then she just did it anyway.
3486500	3490500	And then you went up and you sang a dream a little dream. It was all horrible. It was terrible.
3491500	3501500	But I loved you 10 times more. But at the moment I was like I'm going to love this person for the rest of my life but I can't control her.
3502500	3511500	It's just that feeling, that terror. Our couples therapist, we're so fucked up.
3512500	3522500	I have to hold her hand on the couch. It's called Sensate One. Just hold her hand. It's like an exercise.
3523500	3527500	Dan, just focus on holding her hand. And I hold her hand and she's like what are you thinking about it?
3528500	3532500	And I just burst into tears. Because what I'm thinking is what of us is going to die first?
3533500	3543500	Is what this means. What of us is going to die first? And it's either going to be her or me which is even worse.
3548500	3549500	I wouldn't even get to go to a funeral.
3550500	3563500	When you're in love, when you love someone, that is what the meaning of that whole Cambellian journey is in my mind.
3564500	3572500	You think you own life. You think that you're a native of it. So you've conjoined with another person.
3573500	3579500	Well guess what that means? The price now gets paid and these anxieties just rise up in me.
3580500	3589500	I can't stop thinking of me coming home and you're on the floor and there's a stump where your hand was and there's a half finished bird feeder.
3594500	3596500	I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.
3597500	3599500	How does it look better than a bird feeder?
3605500	3606500	Do you understand what I'm saying?
3607500	3613500	I mean I don't want to even go into what you're talking about because it will get so much darker when I talk about it.
3614500	3620500	I mean it. I do completely understand it. I've been going through that for a while.
3620500	3626500	Cause then there's the romantic, yeah sure there's a romantic notion of oh it's hilarious that's like Game of Thrones someone's hands cut off.
3627500	3629500	I'm like a child. I'm like a child conjuring these things up.
3630500	3637500	Guess what life is? God cutting off more than your hand piece by piece until the fucking last crouton.
3638500	3642500	He pops in his mouth and goes, I give this shitty planet four stars.
3645500	3647500	Your pain was delicious.
3651500	3654500	I loved every drop of your little baby fingers.
3655500	3658500	I love your cancer. I love your war and genocide.
3660500	3661500	I need a second bib.
3665500	3667500	I don't want to mess up my star shirt.
3670500	3671500	I'm God.
3673500	3679500	I'm an asexual food critic for the center of the cosmos.
3680500	3686500	That's what God is. He's like a terrible, terrible food critic.
3687500	3688500	But a great t-shirt.
3691500	3695500	Dan I promise I will be more careful.
3696500	3702500	That's why I've got to get you pregnant. That's like a post-it note, right?
3703500	3706500	You're like about to reach for the razor blades and you're like wait a minute.
3707500	3710500	A fixable Harmon's in here.
3715500	3716500	Wait a fixable Harmon?
3717500	3719500	You know, let's face it.
3722500	3723500	Come on.
3726500	3727500	Come on.
3728500	3730500	Why do you really? Come on.
3731500	3732500	What are you really looking most forward to?
3733500	3738500	It's like a little me, but you can be like get over yourself and he'll be like, okay.
3743500	3747500	I think that's a very, very, very telling.
3750500	3751500	What if it's a woman?
3752500	3753500	Zucian way to look at it.
3754500	3755500	What if it's a daughter?
3756500	3757500	Oh, he will never meet her.
3760500	3761500	He will never know.
3762500	3764500	It'll be a sleeping beauty type situation.
3766500	3771500	If Erin has a daughter, let me remove from the hospital. I'll be handed like a bundle of sticks.
3773500	3774500	I will raise.
3774500	3777500	Let me hand it back your laptop with swaddling clothes.
3780500	3785500	Just kidding. But the idea of it being a fixable you is so disgusting and upsetting.
3786500	3787500	And funny.
3788500	3790500	No, I'm enjoying all of it. So funny.
3790500	3791500	And poignant.
3795500	3796500	Yeah.
3797500	3804500	When we have a baby, I'll bring him here and I'll have everyone in the audience give the baby a gift like sleeping beauty.
3805500	3807500	And then Adam Goldberg will be the last one and he'll be like,
3808500	3810500	Addie, you're our 14th birthday.
3814500	3817500	You are one too heck of a show.
3820500	3823500	But there will be no show.
3826500	3827500	And then he will die.
3828500	3829500	We should. We should.
3829500	3831500	Let's bring out Des Moines and Spencer.
3834500	3835500	Des Moines Brown.
3836500	3837500	Spencer Crittenden.
3851500	3852500	Yay.
3853500	3854500	You know, I could use that space.
3855500	3856500	It's not a status move.
3856500	3859500	You know, like he keeps putting his sweatshirt on my table.
3860500	3861500	I know what he means.
3862500	3863500	What do you mean?
3863500	3864500	This is my show.
3866500	3867500	I mean, it is.
3867500	3871500	Yeah, but it's your when we bring you out, it's your it's your world now.
3872500	3875500	You could put like a note saying it's my show on the table.
3876500	3878500	So that I don't put my sweatshirt on.
3878500	3880500	I mean, yeah, I mean, it's just you're right.
3880500	3882500	Like you don't have to be so vague about it.
3882500	3888500	You could be a total bright red neon sign that says, hey, fuck you, Spencer, my show.
3889500	3890500	I wouldn't baden I.
3891500	3896500	Spencer, you could put a little plastic Santa that says, Dan, like putting a sweatshirt down and says, no.
3903500	3904500	I don't I feel like I could.
3904500	3905500	I don't have that authority.
3906500	3910500	Spencer, have you ever left a note on somebody's car or door or anything to lay down the law?
3911500	3911500	
3911500	3916500	I mean, one time I left a note to my brother about laundry, but that's like that's the only thing.
3916500	3921500	I mean, he's like a roommate kind of where he was at the time when I was living.
3921500	3922500	Are you living alone now?
3922500	3923500	You have a roommate now.
3923500	3929500	I live with a roommate named Jackson, but I just kind of implode with conflicts with him.
3929500	3932500	You know, not going well.
3932500	3937500	No, I'm just all like, oh, I guess, you know, he left the front door unlocked.
3937500	3941500	I guess he'll just, you know, just sit here and stew.
3943500	3945500	And then, yeah, I'm not an extrovert.
3946500	3947500	You got to get your own place.
3948500	3950500	You know, it's all everything's.
3951500	3952500	Yeah, I do.
3954500	3955500	You got to pay me more.
3955500	3957500	No, I get enough.
3957500	3961500	I just haven't found any good places lately.
3961500	3962500	I've been looking.
3962500	3963500	Demarge, how about you?
3963500	3966500	Are you a note leaver or that kind of like?
3966500	3968500	No, I'm a direct contact person.
3968500	3971500	I will say to you, let's talk and then I'll just lay it out.
3971500	3974500	That's the easiest, quickest way to get notes or the notes.
3974500	3978500	I got a really complicated, not complicated, confusing note on my door yesterday.
3979500	3986500	A giant piece of purple paper and like written in Sharpie and it was, hey, I'm going to watch the fight.
3987500	3989500	Manny Pacquiao, Floyd Mayweather fight.
3989500	3993500	And it's going to be, we're going to be in the garage area, signed Terry.
3993500	3995500	I don't know a fucking Terry.
3996500	3997500	I don't know who Terry is.
3997500	3999500	Do you know the garage area?
3999500	4001500	I think, oh, come on by, stop by.
4001500	4002500	Will you welcome?
4002500	4003500	Come one, come all.
4003500	4004500	Bring, would it be a BYOB?
4004500	4010500	I was like, I think that what that was, it was a neighbor saying, you now don't have the right to complain about my noisy party.
4010500	4011500	That's exactly what it was.
4011500	4016500	I thought what that was is like aliens, like, that's the equivalent of duck calls.
4016500	4019500	Like, like, like aliens that don't know our language.
4019500	4027500	They're just like, they're imitating certain words and they're just like leaving a trail of notes like that to like an alien lair where they just gobble people up.
4028500	4030500	So they don't know what they're saying.
4030500	4032500	They're just like, free beer.
4032500	4036500	They just like, they're like amalgamating with their alien technology.
4036500	4037500	That's first of spot.
4037500	4040500	Free beer, Skittles, Tonys.
4041500	4048500	It's like the equivalent, because when you're going, when you're going, when we're going duck hunting, you see those guys going, wah, wah, wah.
4048500	4049500	Like, what are they saying?
4049500	4051500	Like, to a duck.
4051500	4061500	I bet most of the time to a duck, they're like, Larry, Skittles, Dirk, fuck, fuck, fuck, enemy, enemy, Skittles.
4062500	4066500	And so the ducks are like, I think that's probably a hunter.
4067500	4069500	But then every once in a while they kind of nail it.
4069500	4071500	They're like, oh, it's Amy.
4071500	4072500	Oh, it's Amy.
4072500	4074500	Oh, it's Amy.
4074500	4075500	I hate Amy's over there.
4075500	4076500	She sounds good.
4076500	4078500	Have you guys ever partied with Larry Skittles?
4080500	4081500	Or Amy the Duck.
4081500	4082500	It's a lot of fun.
4083500	4084500	What's the deal with this fight?
4087500	4089500	Did you ever see that Gary Larson cartoon?
4089500	4090500	I don't.
4090500	4091500	Talk about the goddamn fight.
4091500	4093500	Let me talk about this Gary Larson cartoon.
4094500	4095500	Because of terrible, terrible shit.
4095500	4096500	It's one of my favorite fire signs.
4096500	4097500	Okay.
4098500	4101500	It's just like, it's two muggers.
4102500	4105500	And then there's like this guy who's like, it's not a guy.
4105500	4112500	It's like this reptile monster with a trench coat on and its tail is coming out the bottom of its trench coat.
4112500	4117500	And it has like this Halloween mask of a human face over it and a hat on.
4117500	4120500	And it's clearly like a foreboding, terrible monster.
4120500	4125500	And the caption is, yes, I would like a knuckle sandwich.
4129500	4130500	That's great.
4130500	4135500	Because just in that fleeting moment, like just one image and one caption, you're like, this is awesome.
4135500	4136500	Like, yeah.
4136500	4137500	All right.
4138500	4141500	When I'm not a big boxing fan, I don't really care about it.
4141500	4142500	A friend of mine had a party.
4142500	4143500	It was fun to go watch a big thing.
4143500	4144500	It's a big.
4144500	4145500	Terry.
4145500	4147500	I did not go to Terry's.
4148500	4149500	I was.
4150500	4152500	I'm almost certain if I show up at whoever Terry's.
4152500	4155500	Also, it didn't say where the fucking place was.
4155500	4156500	It didn't say.
4156500	4157500	It just said Terry.
4158500	4159500	That person knows.
4159500	4160500	I don't know who they are.
4160500	4162500	That's just saying if you hear noise, fuck you.
4162500	4163500	I left a note.
4164500	4171500	When when he Pacquiao came out behind him was Jimmy Kimmel dressed like run DMC for some reason.
4171500	4173500	And he was behind him like when they come out with the entourage.
4173500	4176500	They're coming out behind him is Jimmy Kimmel is being very good at finding.
4176500	4177500	It's camera.
4177500	4179500	And so he's behind Manny Pacquiao.
4179500	4180500	I don't know what that is.
4180500	4183500	Was Manny Pacquiao on the Jimmy Kimmel show a lot.
4183500	4184500	I don't know.
4185500	4187500	We're all on Jimmy Kimmel show at any given time.
4187500	4193500	The cynical part of me said, OK, that maybe the whatever network he's on is Viacom or whatever the fucking thing like that.
4193500	4197500	They have a big stake in this or that's just Jimmy Kimmel being hilarious.
4198500	4202500	That thought that idea goes out the window when Mayweather comes out.
4202500	4203500	And I'm not fucking with you.
4203500	4210500	If you haven't seen this, the fucking Burger King guy, the scary, the king with the fucking horrifying Burger King mask.
4213500	4215500	And he's walking up behind Floyd Mayweather.
4215500	4217500	Burger King was crying all the way.
4217500	4219500	The craziest goddamn shit I've ever seen.
4219500	4223500	And also, Floyd Mayweather was dressed like a Persian prostitute from the 90s.
4223500	4226500	He had some weird Python.
4226500	4227500	It was made of snake.
4227500	4228500	I think it was Python.
4228500	4229500	Wow.
4230500	4235500	I think that's really a weird new direction for fights to go where the Burger King dude is coming out behind him.
4235500	4237500	Wait, for the actual Burger King?
4239500	4241500	I mean, no one's the actual Burger King.
4249500	4251500	I made it 42 years.
4255500	4256500	Sorry, sweetie.
4256500	4257500	That's all right.
4258500	4264500	On one hand, I had the magic, but on the other hand, I was obeying a lot of laws that didn't make sense.
4266500	4269500	A lot of which were super unfair to women.
4269500	4279500	That whole regime is like, don't give unto a woman the patties that would have more cheese for a man and sire the seed under the extra onion.
4279500	4281500	It's a lot of cryptic Aramaic shit.
4283500	4285500	The actual Burger King guy?
4286500	4289500	You know the commercial where the guy has the mask on and he's in bed with your wife all of a sudden?
4289500	4293500	No, he just never scares everybody to death and he's got that weird smiling visage.
4293500	4294500	The Burger King character.
4294500	4296500	Look at the modern, ironic Burger King guy.
4296500	4297500	Yeah, the guy that has the big man.
4297500	4298500	Big head like Jack in the Box.
4298500	4299500	It's a giant man's face.
4299500	4302500	That's kind of a roguish, charming smile on his weird face.
4302500	4308500	He was walking out behind Floyd Money Mayweather, who is one of the most universally unlikable human beings.
4308500	4312500	So Jimmy Kimmel is the coke to Burger King's Pepsi?
4312500	4313500	Like he was on the other side?
4313500	4314500	Yeah.
4314500	4318500	So there's just like two boxers with two corporate sponsors.
4318500	4319500	One of which is Jimmy Kimmel.
4319500	4323500	I would like to live in this universe because Floyd Mayweather is notoriously a terrible person.
4323500	4324500	Well, come on.
4324500	4325500	He beat his wife.
4325500	4326500	Give him a break.
4326500	4327500	That's true.
4327500	4328500	Give him a break.
4328500	4330500	It takes a lot of balls.
4330500	4331500	I forget who said it.
4331500	4333500	Some comic I forget who it was.
4333500	4336500	Someone I follow on Twitter who are mostly comedians said,
4336500	4340500	rooting for Floyd Mayweather is like rooting for Rocky if he was fighting Adrian.
4345500	4347500	I don't know who wrote that, but that was very funny.
4347500	4352500	So I would like to live in a world where Jimmy Kimmel goes, hey, Manny Pacquiao,
4352500	4353500	like you came on my show one time.
4353500	4357500	It'd be pretty funny if I was dressed like Run DMC and come out behind you and he was like,
4357500	4359500	you know, get the gold chain because it was Run DMC.
4359500	4363500	I feel like that was because, and he was there also last night behind Mayweather.
4363500	4365500	Bieber walks out with Mayweather.
4365500	4366500	Oh, Justin Bieber.
4366500	4367500	So Bieber was there as well.
4367500	4368500	It was Bieber and Burger King.
4368500	4372500	And I feel like that might have been Kimmel saying, hey, man, who do you have behind you?
4372500	4373500	Let me be the guy behind you.
4373500	4374500	I hope so.
4374500	4375500	Because it works.
4375500	4376500	May I ask a question?
4376500	4379500	If everybody understands this, I can fuck off.
4379500	4382500	But what is the purpose of this?
4382500	4383500	Is it just like, oh.
4383500	4385500	You punch the other person until they stop.
4385500	4390500	Nobody means like why was this such a big deal?
4390500	4395500	What is the, because it seemed like this was like a big culturally important thing.
4395500	4399500	Normally when boxers are announced, they come out and they have an entourage with them.
4399500	4400500	They're trained.
4400500	4401500	But why are they fighting each other?
4401500	4404500	So one is the other one or like what?
4404500	4405500	A hundred million dollars.
4405500	4409500	Floyd Mayweather made a hundred and eighty million dollars to fight a guy that he knew
4409500	4410500	he was just on the flight.
4410500	4411500	Just on the flight.
4411500	4412500	Then other stuff he made twice.
4412500	4414500	Are you asking about boxing in general?
4414500	4415500	Are you saying?
4415500	4416500	Yeah.
4416500	4419500	Well, I don't, I mean, I'm not, I'm asking less about boxing in general, the sport.
4419500	4421500	And like I said, I can totally fuck off.
4421500	4425500	But I mean like this big fight where I see on Drew Barrymore's Instagram, she's like,
4425500	4426500	it's fight night.
4426500	4427500	I'm like, Drew, what?
4427500	4428500	Why are we?
4429500	4430500	That's it.
4430500	4431500	I think that's just.
4431500	4432500	These big events.
4432500	4434500	If you live long enough, you'll see that happen every eight years.
4434500	4435500	I think eight years ago.
4435500	4436500	Okay.
4436500	4437500	So it's like eight years.
4437500	4441500	So what has to happen for this to be like these guys are.
4441500	4442500	Yeah.
4442500	4443500	Their promoters are both getting very rich.
4443500	4444500	Well, they're famous.
4444500	4445500	They probably have the same promoters.
4445500	4446500	They're famous boxers.
4446500	4447500	They're both number one.
4447500	4448500	And then, okay.
4448500	4451500	They're just famous boxers and they're all like, oh, who do we want to get people to
4451500	4452500	buy tickets for?
4452500	4455500	How about the two most famous guys we can think of?
4455500	4456500	Paper view.
4456500	4458500	The money is like beyond anything.
4458500	4459500	I'm not even sure why.
4459500	4464500	I guess because you can't do pay-per-view football because in, I guess what it is is
4464500	4468500	that the sports leagues, they have this whole tournament thing set up.
4468500	4474500	So whereas boxing, two guys beating each other up, you can arrange one event around.
4474500	4478500	I ask us half jokingly, does it make you hard?
4478500	4479500	I know.
4479500	4480500	I've never.
4480500	4482500	Wait, why do you play sports now though?
4482500	4484500	I mean, it's just sports.
4484500	4485500	No, but there's sports.
4485500	4489500	And then there's like, I mean, you don't say no, but with like sports, you don't say
4489500	4491500	like, ah, we got, okay.
4491500	4493500	We don't have Shaquille O'Neal.
4493500	4498500	As a person who doesn't give a shit about any sports, I mean, the one of the few that
4498500	4506500	makes sense in big air quotes is like, okay, let's fucking like, who are we kidding?
4506500	4507500	Fine.
4507500	4508500	Let's see.
4508500	4509500	Let's stop shooting each other.
4509500	4513860	It looks the weird way that guys can be mean to each other, the whole hierarchy that we
4513860	4518620	live under, like, like, like the idea of two of them getting into a ring and literally
4518620	4523260	being told one of you leaves the other one doesn't, yeah, there's padding everywhere
4523260	4524260	and all this stuff.
4524260	4527980	And there's all these rules, but it's like, like, like I don't watch boxing.
4527980	4531500	I don't watch any sports, but if I, but, but like, what the fuck's the difference between
4531500	4532500	that and the football?
4532500	4535140	It's like, did you just spread it out into team play and stuff?
4535140	4536140	But what do you mean?
4536140	4539260	It's like, this is what, this is what guys are always thinking.
4539260	4541260	It's like, I'm going to punch your face.
4541260	4542260	I'm going to punch your face.
4542260	4543260	I'm going to punch your face.
4543660	4544660	Oh my God.
4544660	4545660	Dan, you're getting hard right now.
4545660	4546660	I can see.
4548660	4557100	Oh, I mean, yeah, I think, I think, I think, I think, I mean, I remember being a kid and
4557100	4560020	two kids getting in a fight and it's always like, I don't know, it's always what's in
4560020	4561020	the air.
4561020	4566260	There's something that has to be paid attention to though is like, like the idea is like everyone's
4566260	4568740	supposed to be scared of getting beaten up.
4568740	4572620	Everyone's supposed to be scared of a, like, like a fist hitting you in the face.
4572980	4577900	That's what, that's what guys live under is like, is like, oh, I'm a, maybe I'll beat
4577900	4578900	you up.
4578900	4579900	Maybe I'll beat you up.
4579900	4581900	Like it's always an unspoken and in the air.
4581900	4584460	These boxing fights just feel like Colosseum stuff.
4584460	4585460	Well, it hasn't changed.
4585460	4586460	Well, they are.
4586460	4587460	Right.
4587460	4588460	But they also.
4588460	4589460	It feels like Colosseum.
4589460	4590460	It feels strange.
4590460	4591460	Of course, yeah.
4591460	4592460	There is science.
4592460	4593460	There is science.
4593460	4594460	Yeah, absolutely.
4594460	4598220	But like, but I, I believe less in the science when Jimmy Kimmel is wearing a hot dog on
4598220	4599220	his head.
4600220	4603620	I guess the problem with the business of boxing, as opposed to the sport of boxing, what we
4603620	4613660	saw last night was in its execution was, I guess both in a way, we saw the, we saw the
4613660	4617660	execution of the business of boxing the way that played out all the way through all the
4617660	4618660	way around.
4618660	4623020	But in it, those guys actually had to choreograph sort of what they were doing to make that
4623020	4624020	pay off.
4624020	4628020	It was really, really odd how in the sixth or seventh round, the announcers all uniformly
4628020	4633100	started criticizing Pacquiao for not fighting as much as he would have, even though Mayweather
4633100	4635620	never came out and tried to attack him.
4635620	4637220	Mayweather ran away the entire fight.
4637220	4641100	Oh, you think that whole thing was really, I mean, I'll believe.
4641100	4642100	Well, I don't know.
4642100	4644540	I think that in that outcome that they had, everybody wins.
4644540	4646540	In other words, Pacquiao, whether Pacquiao wins or loses.
4646540	4650140	Whereas we have seen, we have seen the business model fail when somebody comes out and does
4650140	4653620	arguably what the, what the greatest boxer in the world should do.
4653620	4656580	Mike Tyson, which is go literally.
4656580	4663420	And like the other guy just goes down and it's over and everyone goes, yay, boo.
4663420	4665660	I want my money back, I guess.
4665660	4666660	Yeah, they do.
4666660	4667660	Yeah.
4667660	4668660	They do.
4668660	4669660	So I would believe.
4669660	4674180	And then this way, sort of Mayweather, if Mayweather had lost that fight, everybody who
4674180	4678180	hates him, which is almost everybody, would have pulled him down and said, well, no, he's
4678180	4680300	never going to be amongst the greatest fighters in the world.
4680300	4684100	Now that question is still in the air because he won that fight.
4684100	4688100	He says if he wins one more fight, he will tie the greatest record, Jake LaMotta's record
4688100	4689540	of 49 and 0.
4689540	4690980	And if he does that, he's going to.
4690980	4694460	LaMotta fight the bet, fought some of the best fighters available in the world.
4694460	4695980	Mayweather had nothing to pick from.
4695980	4698620	And when he did have somebody to fight and you want to know why this was so hyped and
4698620	4704340	such a big deal for five to six years, Mayweather refused to fight him for weird reasons like
4704340	4705340	he opposed.
4705340	4706340	Not enough Burger King.
4706340	4709460	He opposed the type of blood testing because he claimed that he was afraid of having a
4709460	4710460	needle stuck in his heart.
4710460	4711780	So it was some weird shit like this.
4712140	4716460	He made every excuse he could to avoid fighting Pacquiao until now, when they're both five
4716460	4717700	years past the time when they should have.
4717700	4718700	And one thing's for sure.
4718700	4719700	I went out.
4719700	4721200	You asked like, does it get you hard?
4721200	4727780	What it does is it creates a sea of violence and there's some statistic of the amount of
4727780	4732780	domestic violence that happens after major boxing bouts and Super Bowls and stuff.
4732780	4737660	I went out afterwards to the drawing room and it was just there was just a general free
4737660	4742060	song of just violence in the air.
4742060	4745740	Not like there was fight starting, but everybody was just talking about when I was a kid, I'm
4745740	4746740	fucking boom.
4746740	4748140	I got a black guy.
4748140	4749140	Everyone's telling stories.
4749140	4750140	I would fucking boom them.
4750140	4751140	Is that what you said?
4751140	4752140	I don't.
4752140	4753140	I just said a bunch of gibberish in a row.
4753140	4754140	But I like that.
4754140	4756140	I would fucking boom them.
4756140	4760740	But there was I was like, I got to get out of here because it was just generally like
4760740	4762860	kind of a weird like hostile testosterone.
4762860	4767620	Well, if you're just thinking about it filtering a testosterone, I'm probably wrong.
4768620	4772020	But I feel like I could I could beat Floyd Merriweather.
4773700	4776860	I mean, let's let's let's all get on the same page.
4776860	4784260	I obviously all organized sports, especially including a gladiatorial combat between two
4784260	4791100	guys who undoubtedly would inspire in a normal world like everyone else is like fealty behind
4791100	4793540	like a possibly subversive army.
4793660	4798380	Like like all of this shit is exercises and pacifying jingoism.
4798380	4806300	You you get the people that you hear in bars that are just like, you know, like those guys
4806620	4812700	that's all White House burning energy just going down the drain and down the drain into
4812700	4814060	fucking Toys R Us.
4814580	4817220	Just Dan and the diaper diaper funds.
4817820	4825380	Yeah, all those guys are like biologically meant to be the the the guys carrying the
4825380	4831260	spears at the fronts of like armies that are still settling who gets to sow their seed
4831260	4832140	across the planet.
4832340	4835700	Now we have this empire where we're all sitting or sucking on pacifiers.
4835900	4840580	How are we going to keep these people from from like going like, look, I'm not smart.
4840620	4841500	I don't get Mr.
4841860	4842980	Fuck this.
4847180	4848820	I've never seen better off dead.
4848820	4849820	I don't get it.
4850460	4855540	I like like like those guys are fucking either in prison or they're or they're working on
4855540	4859860	Wall Street and you give them the occasional basketball game so that they can pound the
4859860	4864660	table and the hot wings can fly in the air and only energy that they'd otherwise use to
4864660	4868500	maybe storm the castle or just be like hanging out in an alley.
4868700	4870460	What else would they do with that energy?
4870540	4873980	Politically, they have nothing to do but like conspire.
4874380	4879420	It's like you organize sports, especially when it's two fucking hulking dudes who are
4879420	4883980	like like what's what do you what do you respect more than a guy that can beat up another
4883980	4889340	guy and like to turn them into property to turn them into the lowest of the low while
4889340	4893100	shining the spotlight on them and collecting money that scatters to the floor around them
4893100	4896980	as their blood flows and they're beating each other and they're fucking like they live
4897700	4898740	You're getting me hard then.
4901220	4904260	I don't want to belittle the art of beating the shit out of anybody.
4905380	4905900	What you said.
4906580	4907060	No, I know.
4907060	4910940	I mean, I think it's like you're asking like, like, like, like, well, like, I don't know.
4910940	4913220	I guess I know your part of me wanted you to know.
4913220	4916540	Yeah, I know there's a fucking stupid no, but like I understand.
4916540	4921180	I'm not I'm not saying I don't understand like the art of I mean, it doesn't matter.
4921180	4923100	But I took boxing for a while.
4923140	4924300	A lot of you don't know.
4924500	4928980	See, my instructor is here and he's like, I remember when she was there.
4930180	4937460	They called me red and I did it after high school.
4937460	4945340	And I did it right before I met you in Atlanta boxing and kick kick kick kick boxing kick
4945340	4949660	boxing. And I did a I I held my ears and I did a whole thing.
4949860	4952140	Well, then, you know, then you know why boxing's neat.
4952180	4953100	All right. Next topic.
4953180	4954660	No, but I mean, yeah.
4954660	4957380	And I'm well, yeah, we're moving on.
4957380	4958220	And no, I'm not.
4958220	4960780	No, I'm not saying I understand why the sport is important.
4960780	4964060	What I was wondering was why this fight in particular was important and to more to
4964060	4966020	explain every every every decade.
4966020	4967220	There's like a pay-per-view event.
4967220	4968940	Like, yeah, that's that's what it is.
4968940	4970340	Whatever do Barry Moore does.
4972380	4974740	Yeah, always disappointed to see my friend, whatever.
4974740	4977380	But I mean, like all my friends are jocks.
4977460	4978380	Cares to everyone.
4978380	4979580	Everyone loves sports.
4979580	4980580	The sports are great.
4980780	4981460	Suck my dick.
4981460	4981860	All right.
4982860	4984420	But didn't you say that you went to J.D.
4984420	4987180	Risner to do a thing and you watched the Super Bowl and you dug it like you got.
4987180	4991780	Of course, if you sit me down and you sit you down and give you a T-shirt,
4992340	4993140	I would watch.
4993140	4994940	I would watch all kinds of lady basketball.
4994980	4997380	Yeah. Are you going to go to a game, Herman?
4997380	4997900	Are you going to go?
4997900	4999820	Of course, I'm going to go to a game of a good husband.
4999820	5000820	Shut up.
5003140	5005860	I can't go this Tuesday as I'm doing another thing, but I want to come to a game.
5006300	5007100	What thing?
5007100	5008100	Please come.
5009540	5010540	Oh.
5012860	5016700	Uh, you're hanging out with your friend Terry, right?
5017740	5022940	No, I'm hosting a show called Lucha Va Voom downtown for that already happened.
5022940	5026860	I can't go this Tuesday because I'm speaking on a writer's panel at UTA with the creator
5026860	5031860	of Blackish because some people consider me a writer fleet.
5032500	5033500	What?
5035260	5041020	Some people think that I slam dunk pieces of paper.
5042860	5043860	Yeah, yeah.
5048860	5050860	What would some say you punch?
5052860	5054860	Three holes in the paper?
5054860	5055860	Yeah.
5060860	5061860	That's a good answer.
5061860	5062860	That's good.
5062860	5065860	But we only use two for the brads, just so you know.
5065860	5068860	That's a big question on the writer's boards.
5069860	5070860	Why not three brads?
5070860	5071860	Have them bottom.
5071860	5072860	Two brads, yeah.
5072860	5073860	The third one is free.
5073860	5074860	No, use the third brad.
5074860	5075860	Do you still use brads?
5075860	5076860	Uh, yeah.
5076860	5077860	Cool.
5081860	5085860	Do you have an optimum length when you're choosing brads, Dan?
5085860	5087860	Do you have a certain kind of length?
5089860	5092860	I find that for dramas, I use a magnum.
5093860	5098860	And then for comedies, you don't want to send the feeling that you wish the script was longer,
5098860	5100860	so you use a micro.
5101860	5103860	There's no way that could have paid off.
5106860	5108860	Curtis is going to go home tonight.
5108860	5110860	He's going to be like, you know what, honey?
5110860	5112860	I don't think I'm going back.
5114860	5116860	I don't like it.
5118860	5119860	I spoke too soon.
5120860	5126860	I'm glad I kept communicating through Twitter, but then he doesn't have my number.
5128860	5130860	Just last night, it was the tipping point.
5130860	5132860	I was like, we didn't play enough Shadowrun.
5132860	5133860	All right.
5133860	5134860	We should get to it, right?
5134860	5135860	Should we play some Shadowrun, everybody?
5135860	5136860	Shadowrun.
5139860	5140860	No.
5140860	5141860	Okay.
5141860	5144860	I just saw a splendid moment from our audience speaking this morning.
5144860	5146860	There's a guy wearing a Met shirt here.
5147860	5149860	Not you, Dave Klein.
5150860	5151860	There's a guy wearing a Met shirt.
5151860	5152860	What's your name?
5152860	5153860	Tim.
5153860	5154860	Tim.
5154860	5156860	He's wearing a Met shirt, and we said, do you want to play some Shadowrun?
5156860	5159860	He put both fists in the air and went, yes!
5160860	5161860	That's our sports.
5161860	5164860	Shadowrun is our gladiatorial arena.
5165860	5173860	Yeah, but I would argue that we're better than athletic people.
5177860	5182860	But isn't the whole point of playing a role-playing game that you get in this fake combat
5182860	5185860	is kind of exercising that same impulse?
5185860	5190860	We should all pretend that we have either a Jimmy Kimmel or a Burger King man behind us.
5190860	5192860	I've got Bieber behind me all the way.
5193860	5194860	Justin Bieber.
5194860	5197860	I have just like a really big flashlight behind me.
5197860	5199860	That's what I'm imagining.
5199860	5203860	I'm really disappointed in the Burger King for backing Mayweather.
5203860	5205860	That's fucked up.
5206860	5209860	Like, I thought a lot better of him, man.
5210860	5211860	Well, seriously, I thought that was like...
5211860	5213860	The Burger King cares only about spectacle.
5213860	5214860	Yeah.
5214860	5215860	Spectacle is money.
5215860	5216860	Spectacle is money.
5216860	5217860	It's true.
5217860	5221860	How insane would it have been if McDonald's had just backed the other guy and just been like...
5221860	5222860	That would be crazy.
5222860	5223860	Like with a hamburger.
5223860	5227860	How sad is it that you said that and I'm like, well, I should have seen that fight.
5228860	5230860	That should have been an undercard.
5230860	5234860	Whoever they did, the lesser fighters were before the main event.
5234860	5238860	There should have been a guy dressed up like Ronald McDonald and a guy dressed like the Burger King.
5238860	5239860	That's good advertising.
5239860	5241860	Colonel Sanders versus Wendy.
5242860	5244860	I'd watch it.
5245860	5250860	And Burger King has the whopper, as in the whopper, as in the hit your wife.
5252860	5257860	There has to be a moment in a boardroom at McDonald's when someone says to them,
5257860	5261860	and you can't tell me that they're not aware of this or that this doesn't happen.
5261860	5263860	That's so big.
5264860	5266860	There has to be a moment when someone says to them,
5266860	5270860	Burger King is sponsoring Mayweather.
5270860	5272860	Meriwether, what's his name?
5272860	5273860	Meriwether.
5273860	5277860	Man, he would hit me for implying his name had a Mary in it.
5277860	5278860	You sure would.
5279860	5281860	So what do you guys think?
5281860	5284860	And then someone on the McDonald's board of directors has to say,
5284860	5287860	like, nah, I don't think we should do that.
5287860	5290860	And then someone else goes like, well, why not?
5290860	5293860	And then someone has to go, because it's too futuristic.
5294860	5296860	It's still on the nose.
5297860	5298860	It's Logan's run.
5298860	5299860	It's insane.
5299860	5300860	It's like, what?
5300860	5303860	There's going to be a burger, burger guys fighting?
5304860	5305860	No, but we'll make so much money.
5305860	5308860	Yeah, but it'll be the end of the world.
5309860	5312860	It has to be Burger King versus Jimmy Kimmel.
5312860	5316860	So that we haven't some people have to keep eating burgers.
5316860	5320860	If it just comes down to like burger guy versus burger guy,
5320860	5324860	everyone's going to finally find out that we're living in a fictional
5324860	5329860	universe and there won't be any reason to not run out into the street and
5329860	5333860	just start flipping over cars because they'll finally see it.
5333860	5338860	There will be a black guy with one fast food logo on his head and another
5338860	5339860	guy.
5339860	5343860	They'll be beating each other up and the fast food logos will be blinking and
5343860	5348860	there'll be burgers on the sides of the screen going up and down and
5348860	5354860	something will snap in even the most indoctrinated fucking thug and
5354860	5356860	we'll be done for.
5356860	5358860	What color is the other guy?
5358860	5359860	I'm sorry.
5362860	5364860	How come one guy got to be black?
5365860	5370860	I assume both guys are black, but I didn't want to derail the conversation
5370860	5371860	by saying they were.
5371860	5372860	Are both guys black?
5372860	5374860	No, Manny Pacquiao's a Filipinos.
5374860	5376860	Well, that's why it's fucking a big match.
5376860	5377860	Jesus.
5378860	5379860	Why didn't you say so?
5380860	5384860	Wait, so now you're on board because there's a race war going on?
5385860	5387860	Manny Pacquiao had that documentary.
5387860	5389860	Maybe that has something to do with it.
5390860	5391860	What's that?
5391860	5392860	I guess not.
5392860	5396860	Well, Manny Pacquiao had that documentary, but I guess there's a resounding
5396860	5397860	silence from the internet.
5397860	5399860	Manny Pacquiao trains right down the street, like three blocks down the street.
5399860	5400860	Yeah, Freddie Roach is Jim.
5400860	5401860	Freddie Roach.
5401860	5404860	I went up there one time as our dearly departed friend Sam Simon used to manage
5404860	5406860	the Crater of Simpsons and all a bunch of stuff.
5406860	5410860	He managed a heavyweight fighter named Lehman Brewster, who was a heavyweight
5410860	5413860	champion for, like, defended it like two or three times.
5413860	5416860	I went there one time with Sam and watched him train Freddie's there.
5416860	5419860	And it was like Francois Botha, who was like, I think it was called the White
5419860	5420860	Buffalo.
5420860	5421860	I remember him.
5421860	5424860	He was in the ring training and the sound they make when they're just sparring,
5424860	5427860	like the guy would block a punch and they hit each other in the arms.
5427860	5431860	And these guys, they weigh like fucking 250 pounds and lifting each other up off
5431860	5433860	the ground and moving them a foot.
5433860	5435860	And the sound it makes is so horrifying.
5435860	5438860	And Freddie Roach's younger brotherhood just got out of jail, I believe.
5438860	5440860	He was like, Jeff, get in the ring.
5440860	5441860	Put some gloves on.
5441860	5442860	Go in there.
5442860	5443860	Go in there and get in there.
5443860	5447860	I'm like, to steal Chris Rock's joke, I said, if I get in that ring, down 9-1.
5447860	5449860	Fucking horrifying.
5449860	5450860	It's really scary.
5450860	5453860	Did you see the, God damn it, I'm going to derail things now.
5453860	5455860	The Mike Tyson documentary?
5455860	5456860	Yeah, it's great.
5456860	5457860	Did you watch it?
5457860	5458860	Yeah.
5458860	5461860	As with the Frank Snatcher documentary, it's again, it's like, okay, I'm not
5461860	5462860	going to say this.
5462860	5468860	Like Mike Tyson, like he hit women and like a terrible guy too.
5468860	5471860	But however, there shouldn't be a however.
5471860	5472860	He was so cute when he got up.
5472860	5476860	But, but, but, but, but.
5476860	5479860	He had like this glimmer in his eye.
5479860	5481860	You guys had to see it.
5481860	5483860	But the other, the.
5483860	5485860	Curtis is looking, I'm just, I'm kidding.
5485860	5490860	The insane personal side of like, of like, like, like, I don't know, just like,
5490860	5494860	like the, the, the, uh, just listening to him talk.
5494860	5495860	It was like, he's in a documentary.
5495860	5497860	So there's always that point where someone cries.
5497860	5502860	If it's a good documentary in the book early on, it's like, and then as I, that
5502860	5503860	was that point.
5503860	5506860	And then the first guy beat the shit out of him.
5506860	5510860	He's like, started crying because it was like, he, he didn't like, he didn't want
5510860	5513860	to ever beat the shit out of anyone, but like fucking did.
5513860	5514860	Yes.
5514860	5518860	It all feels, it all feels so tragic and no one beats their wives because they're
5518860	5519860	an adjusted great person.
5519860	5524860	But he had like this, he had like this mentor who was like, I don't know.
5524860	5527860	It was like, it was just like, you're watching the documentary and you go, God
5527860	5528860	damn it.
5528860	5531860	Can you just, can you just not hit women so that everyone can like recognize you
5531860	5532860	as this amazing hero?
5532860	5535860	Because it's like, you can't stop those like bells ringing.
5535860	5537860	By the way, Sean Penn, everyone loves Sean Penn.
5537860	5540860	He tied Madonna to a chair and fucking tortured her for two days.
5540860	5541860	Like, fuck you.
5541860	5543860	Like, here's your Oscar.
5543860	5544860	Here's your Oscar.
5544860	5545860	Fuck you.
5545860	5546860	They're always at work.
5546860	5550860	But it's not, it's not, it's not just, it's not just the fucking barbarians.
5550860	5551860	The, the, the.
5551860	5552860	I'm sorry.
5552860	5553860	We're going to play shadow run, but then this happened.
5553860	5554860	No, but that's the thing.
5554860	5558860	That's the thing that's awful about it because there is a sport behind boxing.
5558860	5564860	Obviously it's a sport and it's, it's, it's a very sophisticated thing, but also
5564860	5568860	the people that are in it don't tend to be the most adjusted non abusey type
5568860	5569860	people.
5569860	5570860	Yeah.
5570860	5571860	Where are you going to pull them from?
5571860	5572860	Harvard.
5572860	5573860	That happened to them.
5573860	5575860	There's a reason why they hit people so hard.
5575860	5578860	It's pretty amazing when you can pull someone from out of the, out of that
5578860	5583860	environment and discipline them enough to, because like, it seems like there's
5583860	5588860	so many rules to beating the shit out of another man who, who has also learned
5588860	5590860	how to beat the shit out of another man.
5590860	5596860	Like that you have to like, you wouldn't, you wouldn't imagine any of these
5596860	5601860	people getting into the ring as being people who were capable of like, like
5601860	5604860	showing up at 6 a.m. for like a practice or something.
5604860	5609860	But obviously they have more discipline than, than anybody, which is like, man,
5609860	5611860	I've never worked hard for anything.
5611860	5615860	Like I always imagine the guys that beat people up as being the laziest people
5615860	5616860	in the world.
5616860	5617860	But, but some people.
5617860	5618860	Well, hang on a second.
5618860	5620860	You know, I'm trying to remember his name now.
5620860	5626860	He was the world heavyweight champion in the, in the twenties.
5626860	5628860	Where works hard.
5628860	5629860	Hang on.
5629860	5633860	This guy, this guy, I don't remember his name.
5633860	5636860	I always blank on his name, but he was an interesting guy.
5636860	5640860	He was the world heavyweight champion and he was a Shakespearean scholar.
5640860	5646860	At the same time, he was somebody who, I have a book at home, which is a
5646860	5649860	collection of the complete works of Shakespeare.
5649860	5652860	And it was signed by this guy.
5652860	5658860	And then the student who owned the book made a note in it that so and so,
5658860	5662860	I can't remember his fucking name, the heavyweight champion of the world,
5662860	5667860	and you'd know his name immediately if I could remember it, which I can't,
5667860	5674860	talked to professors such and such as class on the bard in, you know, on that,
5674860	5675860	on this date.
5675860	5680860	So this guy was the, I mean at the time, the heavyweight champion of the world
5680860	5683860	could also be a Shakespearean scholar.
5683860	5689860	Well, let's, let's all, let's all aspire to those days again.
5689860	5690860	What was his name?
5690860	5691860	Was it Jim?
5691860	5692860	Jim something or other?
5692860	5693860	What's his name?
5693860	5695860	De Grey Hitter Bean.
5695860	5696860	I don't know.
5696860	5697860	Somebody can look it up.
5697860	5698860	Hitter Beaner?
5698860	5700860	No, Hitter, Hitter Bean.
5700860	5701860	Okay.
5701860	5702860	All right.
5702860	5705860	Let's place, Jesus Christ.
5705860	5709860	Spencer, who are, is our guest recapper for today?
5709860	5710860	Oh yeah.
5710860	5711860	Do we have one?
5711860	5712860	Claire from Australia.
5712860	5713860	Oh really?
5713860	5715860	We've gone down under and we've gone.
5715860	5717860	And you're gonna do her accent?
5717860	5718860	Yep.
5718860	5725860	That would be great.
5725860	5730860	We talked on the phone and this is how she sounds.
5730860	5733860	Last time on Shadow Rush.
5733860	5735860	Last time on Shadow Run Shantytown.
5735860	5740860	We opened with the gang inside their van with the rescued youngster, Jelly Dervish,
5740860	5743860	and a tied up Arturo Spagouli.
5743860	5748860	Well, discussing the successful mission, Eve took the shadow out of Shadow Run and revealed
5748860	5753860	too much information about Dervish while Arturo was assertively listening.
5753860	5758860	Nightblade stayed with Arturo in the van while the rest of the gang went inside Hank's last stand
5758860	5763860	and came across a saucy stranger in a magenta suit with a bow slung over his shoulder.
5763860	5769860	Mercy attempted and failed to learn his identity, so she gave up and left to take a shit.
5769860	5774860	The gang received thanks and a payment from the Ryan Dervish fellow and as well as a bonus
5774860	5777860	of the shoes off the poor Italian's feet.
5777860	5782860	Meanwhile, in the van Spagouli mentioned to Nightblade that their gang has compromised
5782860	5788860	their anonymity with the security footage and the burger tyrant, implying a hit could follow.
5788860	5793860	Jim discussed the risk of rewarding Shadow Runs and the reason why good men rationalize
5793860	5795860	why they do bad things.
5795860	5800860	And in this world, that is a prison. Spagouli is just a pedophile.
5801860	5804860	What will the gang's next mission be?
5804860	5807860	Will this flamboyant stranger reveal his identity?
5807860	5809860	And will Spagouli take his revenge?
5809860	5813860	Find out now on Shadow Run.
5818860	5821860	Thank you, Claire.
5821860	5825860	I missed one week.
5825860	5829860	And none of that sounds familiar to me.
5829860	5832860	One week and all of those characters showed up?
5832860	5835860	Curtis, we accomplished one Shadow Run.
5835860	5838860	We accomplished one mission, so we're kind of starting from scratch right now.
5838860	5840860	I feel like if you had been here, you'd be like,
5840860	5844860	I've been here three weeks and we're still in the car?
5844860	5847860	I was getting comfortable.
5847860	5849860	I was getting comfortable. All of this is new to me.
5849860	5850860	Now what do I do?
5850860	5852860	I didn't even hear Dr. Friend mention.
5852860	5854860	He didn't do much at all.
5854860	5857860	You were there when we went back to the place.
5857860	5861860	So basically, in between there, there was an episode where we...
5861860	5863860	I don't think we did much at any time.
5863860	5865860	Because you were out of town. You did it out of town.
5865860	5869860	Right. All we've done is we've taken the kid back to his dad.
5869860	5874860	And I'm in the car with the mob...
5874860	5879860	And we're in a bar, and right now there is an interesting new character
5879860	5882860	that we don't know anything about who's wearing a magenta and blue suit.
5882860	5885860	And it has a bow and arrow kind of situation on him.
5885860	5888860	So he seems to be like somebody we might want to investigate.
5888860	5890860	Okay. Sorry.
5890860	5893860	I just couldn't believe we moved that far ahead.
5893860	5894860	We didn't really go that far.
5894860	5897860	Okay. It seemed like it.
5897860	5902860	So I walk up to the bar and get near the fellow in the magenta suit, Spencer.
5902860	5907860	All right. He's drinking a glass of water. Quietly.
5907860	5909860	I say, what's your name?
5909860	5913860	Oh, you know. I don't give that out too easily.
5913860	5916860	Okay. I'm the same way. I like your style. And I walk away.
5922860	5924860	That happens.
5924860	5931860	Meanwhile, in the car, I think Jim Nightblade was just climaxing an epic rant.
5931860	5934860	It wasn't my choice to cliff break.
5934860	5937860	Oh, I remember. I remember.
5937860	5938860	So anyway...
5938860	5939860	Is he by himself?
5939860	5940860	That's how I feel.
5940860	5943860	He's with me. I'm a gangster. I'm tied up.
5946860	5947860	So that's how it is.
5947860	5950860	Shit. Shit, man.
5950860	5954860	Well, I think I understand if you want to untie me.
5964860	5967860	So you're not going to...
5967860	5972860	And I encourage you to be convincing.
5972860	5977860	You're going to forget this happened and nothing's ever going to happen.
5977860	5978860	Yeah, man.
5979860	5983860	I said this. The speed of your response, it's reflexive.
5983860	5988860	It feels like if you were lying, it's like a guy who just wants to get out of the car.
5988860	5991860	Well, okay. You're right. Run it by me again.
5993860	6001860	Okay. So if you try to pursue this event, if you try to follow up on it,
6001860	6008860	if any harm comes to jellyfish or his father...
6008860	6011860	Jelly Dervish and Ryan Dervish.
6012860	6017860	It will be repaid upon your family for generations to come.
6017860	6018860	Yeah, man.
6018860	6020860	All right. You know what?
6021860	6026860	I don't believe you. I'm going to shoot him.
6032860	6035860	This Shadow Run brought to you by Burger King.
6036860	6041860	I'm sorry, Curtis. This isn't me. This is a character.
6041860	6042860	It's Ryan.
6042860	6045860	I'm shooting him. I'm shooting him in the head.
6045860	6046860	I'm shooting him in the head.
6046860	6050860	You shoot him right in the head and he doesn't even have time to react.
6050860	6054860	Your robot-like arm reflexes are so reflexive.
6055860	6061860	He doesn't even have time to breathe out once on the floor.
6065860	6066860	I told you, Mother!
6066860	6069860	It's an interesting trait for an assassin.
6072860	6074860	The loudest diaper.
6075860	6078860	Can I use my smart link?
6078860	6079860	Yep.
6079860	6082860	Okay. I use my smart link to contact everybody.
6083860	6084860	Oh, that's the comm link.
6084860	6086860	Oh, sorry. Real smart.
6087860	6089860	I use my comm link.
6091860	6097860	Everyone, can we meet by the truck to regroup?
6098860	6101860	We're all in the bar right now. Everybody but Nightblade.
6101860	6102860	All right. Let's meet in the bar.
6102860	6105860	I'm here, too. I'm staring at you while I'm saying this.
6106860	6109860	Nightblade, can you meet us in here? We don't know what you're doing.
6109860	6111860	Yeah. I just got to clean up the Uber and make sure...
6111860	6114860	I get on the comm link and say at Nightblade, what's happening?
6114860	6116860	You coming? What's going down?
6116860	6120860	We see some cups and fries and stuff. We've got to pick up the Uber and make sure...
6120860	6122860	That's not normally your style to tidy up an Uber.
6122860	6124860	Normally, you just kind of leave the Uber as is.
6124860	6127860	The Uber, like if we send it back with a body, like what...
6127860	6129860	Is there an Uber driver or is it a robot?
6129860	6130860	It's a robot, yeah.
6130860	6133860	Is there surveillance in the Uber?
6133860	6135860	There's cameras, yeah.
6135860	6140860	Uber is a pretty private company. They don't work with police.
6140860	6141860	Oh, that's good to know.
6141860	6144860	If you send one back with a dead body in it, there's a...
6144860	6149860	I mean, I don't think that's a fair question to ask the Dungeon Master.
6149860	6151860	I don't know. I think that in general...
6151860	6153860	Well, from my understanding, though, I'm a criminal.
6153860	6156860	Yeah, no, you don't just send bodies. I mean, you don't just...
6156860	6158860	Yeah, you take care of bodies.
6158860	6163860	All right. I drag the body out of the Uber and I radio to them, like, I'm almost there.
6163860	6167860	Listen, we left some rappers.
6167860	6169860	There's charges.
6169860	6175860	I mean, like, drag the body out and I find, like, a dumpster.
6175860	6178860	Okay. You find a dumpster near Hank's last stand.
6178860	6180860	I throw the body in there.
6180860	6181860	Mm-hmm.
6181860	6186860	Okay. And all right. I go to join them.
6186860	6188860	That happens. You enter.
6188860	6191860	There's a purple-suited man with a bow.
6191860	6194860	Other than that, there's just Teddy and the Dervishes.
6194860	6196860	I woke up tonight, Blaine, and I go,
6196860	6199860	why is there blood spatter on your face right now?
6199860	6204860	Spagulli is, you know...
6204860	6207860	Did you do Spagulli? Did you take him out?
6207860	6211860	He's not. He agrees that the mission is over.
6211860	6217860	The mission of breathing?
6217860	6221860	There won't be anything to talk about anymore about it.
6221860	6225860	It's like the mission's over. We went on it and it's done.
6225860	6227860	What have you done?
6227860	6231860	Hodergaard knows the answer to this and all other details in between.
6231860	6235860	He rolls his eyes, then activates his mind probe
6235860	6238860	and directs it toward the young man who's sitting with the magenta suit
6238860	6241860	to see if there's some sort of information that he can draw from him.
6241860	6245860	All right. You start doing that and the man starts screaming in agony.
6245860	6248860	He leaps to his feet and pulls his bow and starts pointing it wildly.
6248860	6252860	You're getting flashes of pain and darkness
6252860	6256860	and loneliness and grim work being done.
6256860	6259860	I jump up and, using my charisma and composure,
6259860	6261860	I say to the man who's wildly pointing his bow,
6261860	6266860	hey, hey, what are you drinking?
6266860	6270860	He goes, ah, I'm being mind-probed and it hurts like hell.
6270860	6273860	This is the worst. I'm going to start...
6274860	6276860	Calm down.
6276860	6278860	He starts losing arrows every which way.
6278860	6280860	I stopped the mind probe.
6280860	6282860	All right.
6282860	6284860	Three arrows bury themselves in the ceiling.
6284860	6287860	It seems that the mind probe threw off his aim.
6287860	6290860	Or maybe he's a poor aim.
6290860	6294860	I saddle up next to him, using my charisma.
6294860	6298860	Hey, sharpshooter.
6298860	6300860	What's your name?
6300860	6302860	Not really in the mood to talk.
6302860	6304860	I get it.
6304860	6306860	I get it.
6306860	6309860	I'll have what he's having.
6309860	6312860	Hank brings you a water.
6314860	6316860	Cool. Cool.
6316860	6319860	Level. Transparent. I get it.
6319860	6324860	Hey, obviously you just had a freak out.
6324860	6328860	I get that. I've freaked out before.
6328860	6330860	What's going on with you?
6330860	6333860	I'm just a connoisseur of stories. What's your deal?
6333860	6336860	I think that guy just tried to read my thoughts.
6336860	6338860	Fuck.
6338860	6340860	I should...
6340860	6342860	God damn it. I hate that.
6342860	6344860	I'm not always shuttle.
6344860	6347860	That fucking sucks. What do you think he got?
6347860	6350860	Nothing. Probably. I don't know.
6350860	6353860	Maybe my childhood.
6355860	6357860	I go on the comm link and I say to Mercy,
6357860	6360860	we're kind of out of a job right now.
6360860	6362860	Maybe this guy...
6362860	6364860	Find out if he has something he wants us to do.
6364860	6366860	All right.
6366860	6370860	Childhood. The worst. Why do we have him?
6372860	6376860	You look like you're somebody who wants something
6376860	6379860	and I'm somebody who gives things.
6382860	6385860	What's going on with you?
6385860	6389860	I'm not on the up and up. Neither are my friends.
6390860	6393860	Do you have any V.D.'s?
6393860	6396860	Vendettas?
6403860	6407860	She's not our face man for nothing, you guys.
6407860	6413860	Yeah, but I don't talk about business at the bar.
6414860	6416860	It's just a personal rule.
6416860	6418860	Yeah, I understand that.
6418860	6421860	I'm going to the bathroom.
6423860	6425860	Will you take a walk with me?
6425860	6427860	No, I'm actually here to meet a friend.
6427860	6430860	Cool, cool, cool.
6430860	6434860	Yeah, me too. I like two or four friends.
6435860	6437860	You smell...
6437860	6440860	I'm sorry to say this. You smell dangerous.
6440860	6443860	What...
6443860	6448860	This is so embarrassing, but what might I be smelling?
6448860	6451860	What is that smell? What is that dangerous smell?
6451860	6454860	Danger.
6454860	6456860	Oh my God, danger.
6456860	6460860	I'm playing with a button on the top of my shirt.
6462860	6465860	Oh no, you're going to be one of these guys.
6465860	6468860	I know you're one of these guys.
6469860	6472860	I have a really hard time talking to guys
6472860	6477860	who I know are really physically impressive and violent.
6479860	6481860	Who are you...
6481860	6484860	I'm meeting somebody too.
6484860	6488860	Who are you meeting? Are you meeting...
6488860	6490860	An old friend.
6490860	6493860	An old friend, me too.
6493860	6496860	Can we play a game really fast?
6496860	6499860	I don't play games.
6500860	6503860	What if I told you I was a game?
6503860	6505860	I wouldn't.
6511860	6514860	What if I told you I was a game with a reward?
6516860	6519860	I don't play games.
6519860	6523860	Alright, what if I gave you the rule book?
6526860	6528860	That's hot.
6528860	6530860	That's hot.
6532860	6534860	Gently.
6535860	6538860	Spencer, what's the bartender's name?
6538860	6539860	Hank.
6539860	6540860	I walk up to Hank and say,
6540860	6542860	Hank, is there a Mr. Johnson that we can meet?
6542860	6544860	We're kind of out of a job right now.
6544860	6546860	I don't know, man. You got to talk to Ted about that.
6546860	6548860	Okay, was Ted in the house?
6548860	6551860	Oh yeah, he's talking to Jelly.
6551860	6552860	Alright, yeah.
6552860	6555860	Okay, I walk over to Ted and Jelly
6555860	6558860	and sit down next to them and say,
6558860	6561860	Mercy, our usual face man,
6561860	6564860	is apparently a prostitute now.
6564860	6566860	I'm not sure what's going on precisely,
6566860	6569860	but do you have any gigs for us?
6569860	6574860	I mean, I wanted to talk to you guys about video surveillance.
6574860	6575860	Uh-oh.
6575860	6578860	It seems that, again, on your last mission,
6578860	6580860	you left a bunch of security cameras.
6580860	6581860	It's just, it's no good.
6581860	6583860	I mean, my clients can't have, you know,
6583860	6585860	personal data's leaking out.
6585860	6587860	They can't be tied back to these things.
6587860	6588860	It's no problem.
6588860	6590860	I mean, I understand you got your strengths,
6590860	6591860	you got your weaknesses,
6591860	6594860	but that's why I called in some help.
6594860	6595860	Uh-oh.
6595860	6597860	He's a techno-mancer,
6597860	6599860	and his name is Hack Eye.
6602860	6605860	Are you referring to the guy with a bow?
6605860	6606860	Yeah, he's over there.
6606860	6608860	He's going to be helping you out
6608860	6610860	with the technological side of things,
6610860	6612860	so I already had him wipe that.
6612860	6613860	So I didn't have to do all this?
6613860	6616860	I could have just asked, I guess.
6616860	6617860	I don't know.
6617860	6618860	I don't know what you're talking about.
6618860	6619860	So you're saying that...
6619860	6621860	Look, I'm the first one to agree
6621860	6624860	that on the technological side, we're not that savvy.
6624860	6626860	So this guy over there at the bar,
6626860	6628860	is that the guy you're talking about?
6628860	6629860	Yeah, that's him.
6629860	6632860	He's a pretty renowned hacker around these parts.
6632860	6634860	He's a good friend of mine.
6634860	6635860	He knew cool Dennis.
6635860	6637860	And we can trust this guy?
6638860	6639860	Yeah.
6639860	6641860	Using the power to analyze truth,
6641860	6643860	I analyzed what the hell that was
6643860	6645860	that just came out of your mouth.
6646860	6648860	It was confusion,
6648860	6651860	because we're talking about, you know,
6651860	6654860	hired murderers and criminals.
6654860	6656860	Trust is, I mean, I don't know.
6656860	6660860	It's a perilous concept in this kind of world.
6660860	6661860	So do you have a job for us?
6661860	6662860	And if you do,
6662860	6663860	you're saying that we have to bring along
6663860	6665860	this weirdo at the bar?
6665860	6666860	I'm not saying anything.
6666860	6668860	I'm saying if you want, you know,
6668860	6670860	if you want him to go on runs with you,
6670860	6671860	you can.
6671860	6672860	He can stay here.
6672860	6675860	If you just need someone to delete security footage,
6675860	6677860	he could do that.
6677860	6678860	I mean...
6678860	6680860	Yeah, look, truth be told,
6680860	6683860	we did kind of leave a messy trail behind us on that.
6685860	6686860	That's okay.
6686860	6687860	Okay.
6687860	6688860	So do you have a job for us?
6688860	6691860	Yeah, I actually got someone on the horn right now.
6691860	6693860	You know those guys that hired you
6693860	6695860	to get that Baldwin guy?
6695860	6697860	They loved your work so much.
6697860	6699860	They want to hire you again.
6699860	6700860	Oh, yeah? What's the job?
6700860	6701860	I'll let him tell you.
6701860	6703860	Are you guys ready?
6703860	6705860	I think we should bring Mercy over for this
6705860	6706860	because she's our face person.
6706860	6707860	Yeah.
6707860	6708860	You look over and at this point,
6708860	6709860	I'm just taking the water
6709860	6711860	and just pouring it on my face.
6712860	6717860	She's a maniac, maniac on the floor.
6717860	6718860	And then I overhear you and I'm like,
6718860	6720860	excuse me, and I...
6720860	6721860	You're gross.
6721860	6723860	And I walk away.
6726860	6727860	I join.
6727860	6728860	Okay.
6728860	6730860	Lay it on Ted or whatever your name is.
6730860	6733860	He flips on the screen and you see a black avatar
6733860	6736860	of a shadowy businessman figure.
6737860	6738860	He goes,
6738860	6742860	I see you've done some work in the past for our company
6742860	6745860	and we are very grateful.
6745860	6748860	You see, you helped us with a recent acquisition
6748860	6752860	and we need some help finding some of that acquisitions,
6752860	6754860	former possessions.
6754860	6757860	Sir, if you need to take a moment to breathe,
6757860	6759860	take all the time you need.
6759860	6761860	That is very rude.
6763860	6764860	Can you be more specific?
6764860	6766860	What do you mean, acquisitions and whatnots?
6766860	6769860	Oh, we recently took on a new hire
6769860	6771860	that you helped procure for us
6771860	6774860	and he left some of his prior work
6774860	6776860	at a former employer.
6776860	6778860	Now we hope to receive some of that work,
6778860	6780860	but it has made it hard for us
6780860	6781860	and he's hit it away.
6781860	6783860	Are you talking about BTL chips from Baldwin?
6783860	6786860	We're talking about research in that department,
6786860	6787860	something along those lines.
6787860	6789860	We don't know exactly what the research is,
6789860	6790860	but we know it's valuable.
6790860	6793860	These are digital files, perhaps, that you are seeking?
6793860	6795860	Yes.
6796860	6799860	So you usually go somewhere and get some files?
6801860	6803860	Yes, I would like that very much.
6803860	6804860	All right.
6804860	6805860	All right.
6805860	6807860	Do you have any other pertinent information?
6807860	6808860	Yes.
6808860	6811860	I do have both of those things.
6811860	6815860	Mind Plus Limited, it is a small bioware clinic
6815860	6818860	specializing in brain stuffs.
6818860	6823860	They operate a small clinic in the burbs.
6823860	6825860	There is the pay data.
6825860	6829860	It's kept under lock and key, very strict security.
6829860	6834860	They've got vibration sensors, cameras, and guards.
6837860	6838860	Oh, my.
6839860	6843860	So some of this material is organic?
6843860	6844860	Oh, yes.
6844860	6847860	The biowares for brain enhancements.
6847860	6853860	What is the security system like at Brain Limited Plus Clinic?
6853860	6854860	I don't know everything,
6854860	6860860	but I know they've got vibration sensors, cameras, and guards.
6860860	6861860	Hey, you know what?
6861860	6863860	It seems like I pulled it up.
6863860	6864860	I pull our team.
6864860	6865860	Do we have a team name?
6865860	6867860	Have we come up with a team name?
6867860	6869860	We're the scooterlings, right?
6869860	6871860	The scooterlings.
6871860	6873860	The fuckups.
6873860	6876860	We're called Los Fuckups.
6876860	6879860	I pull the team aside and say, okay, this sounds pretty technological.
6879860	6882860	I think we might need a technomancer on board on this one.
6882860	6884860	Yeah, we're going to bring that asshole with the bow with us, right?
6884860	6885860	Why not bring him?
6885860	6887860	He seems fascinating.
6887860	6888860	What's the worst-case scenario?
6888860	6890860	We live our lives and don't meet new people
6890860	6893860	that technomance with bows and arrows and whatnot?
6893860	6897860	I'm still a bit worried about this old friend.
6897860	6898860	Mmm.
6898860	6899860	Sorry, what?
6899860	6901860	The old friend that he's waiting to meet.
6901860	6905860	Oh, yeah, because the technomancer is waiting for a friend.
6905860	6908860	Oh, but yeah, we all have backstory.
6908860	6909860	All right.
6909860	6911860	You ever asked me about mine?
6911860	6912860	So Ted...
6912860	6914860	I'm going fucking insane over here.
6914860	6917860	I just murdered a guy in a car.
6917860	6919860	Ted, what's the name of the guy?
6919860	6920860	Who's our...
6920860	6922860	How am I not interesting?
6922860	6926860	Why aren't people trying to, like, read my mind?
6926860	6930860	Because I'm not sitting in a corner with a fucking bow is why.
6930860	6933860	Do we have all the information we need for this job?
6933860	6936860	I'm going to fucking explode.
6936860	6938860	You can always find more information.
6938860	6942860	Using the sort of maps that I have in my head
6942860	6949860	and using relevant information name of the actual building,
6949860	6952860	everything indicates the location is...
6952860	6954860	This is the map that I'm using in my head.
6954860	6956860	Near the beach.
6956860	6958860	Oh, wait, near the beach.
6958860	6959860	But I have a specific...
6959860	6961860	And I have a specific route to this.
6961860	6962860	Oh, yeah.
6962860	6963860	Okay.
6963860	6964860	So I know where it is.
6964860	6965860	I know how to get us there.
6965860	6968860	And we're specifically looking to get certain files?
6968860	6969860	Yes.
6969860	6972860	They're research belonging to the former employee.
6972860	6973860	Baldwin.
6973860	6974860	Brown.
6974860	6975860	Baldwin Brown, okay.
6975860	6978860	Was name beyond him or did we take all the files?
6979860	6981860	You know, whatever works.
6981860	6984860	How did we all meet?
6986860	6987860	All right.
6987860	6990860	I walk over to the guy that won't tell me his name
6990860	6994860	and I sidle up next to him and I say, Bartender, I want a water.
6994860	6996860	Okay. You get the water.
6996860	6998860	I get the water and I toast the guys.
6998860	7000860	I know it's bad luck to toast water,
7000860	7003860	but are you into making some easy money?
7003860	7005860	Oh, yeah.
7006860	7008860	You strike me as maybe the kind of guy
7008860	7011860	that maybe knows a little bit about technology?
7011860	7012860	I do.
7012860	7013860	Yeah?
7013860	7014860	My name's Eve.
7014860	7015860	What's your name?
7015860	7017860	I know you didn't like telling your name,
7017860	7018860	but I gave you mine.
7018860	7020860	They call me Hack Eye.
7020860	7021860	Oh, Hack Eye.
7021860	7022860	It's the worst.
7022860	7023860	It's the worst.
7024860	7027860	Is your last name Pierce?
7027860	7029860	I don't have a last name.
7029860	7030860	Okay.
7030860	7032860	We got a job.
7032860	7034860	We're going to have to...
7034860	7035860	Thank you, Curtis.
7035860	7036860	Sorry.
7036860	7038860	I liked it.
7040860	7043860	My match reference was only made Curtis laugh.
7044860	7046860	I say we're going to have to...
7046860	7049860	We need a guy like you that's a techno-mancer
7049860	7050860	to help us out in this job,
7050860	7053860	but first, as is our policy,
7053860	7055860	we got to take you out back and kind of...
7055860	7056860	Jump you in.
7056860	7057860	Jump you in.
7057860	7058860	We're going to jump you in.
7058860	7060860	Oh, Nightblade's going to jump you in?
7060860	7062860	I mean, I don't know the jumping in.
7062860	7064860	Our friend Nightblade, the jumping in.
7064860	7066860	We all jump them in.
7066860	7068860	That's the Vida loca.
7068860	7069860	Okay.
7069860	7071860	It's not like a personal thing.
7071860	7072860	Hack Eye, it's not a personal thing,
7072860	7074860	but we just got to make sure that you're legit.
7074860	7075860	We got to jump you in.
7075860	7076860	You can handle yourself.
7076860	7077860	Okay, jump you in.
7077860	7078860	You're going to jump you in.
7078860	7080860	You ready to get jumped in?
7080860	7081860	Yeah.
7081860	7082860	Yeah?
7082860	7083860	You like getting jumped in?
7083860	7084860	Oh, my God.
7084860	7085860	Yeah.
7085860	7086860	Yeah?
7086860	7087860	All right, let's go in back.
7087860	7088860	Let's jump this guy in.
7088860	7089860	All right.
7089860	7091860	Cliffhanger!
7093860	7096860	This is the weirdest Cliffhanger.
7100860	7101860	Thank you, everybody.
7101860	7103860	Aaron McGathey.
7104860	7106860	Demarj Brown.
7108860	7110860	Spencer Crittenden.
7112860	7114860	Curtis Armstrong.
7117860	7119860	I'm Jeff Davis, and your mayor, of course,
7119860	7121860	is Mr. Dan Harmon.
7122860	7123860	Whoa!
7126860	7127860	Once again, brought to you by Burger King.
7127860	7130860	Do it your way, Burger King.
7137860	7139860	Did you get any of that?
7140860	7142860	It's a good show!
