0	18140	I'm Brandon Johnson. I'm sitting in for Jeff Davis, who we love so much, do we not? Spencer
18140	23580	Crittenton is not with us tonight. We love him so much, do we not? Well, let's just get
23580	35100	started. We love you downtown, Dynasty Theater. Welcome to the stage, Mr. Dan Harmon and Rob
35100	55700	Shaw. Rob Shaw, everybody. Whoa, look at that comfortable chair, boy. Oh, you just get everything
55700	64260	you want, don't you? Nice, comfortable chair. It's very nice. For those of you who tune in for
64260	75940	the serialized aspect of our show, Shrob complains about stuff. And then the next episode, people have
75940	82620	indulged him. He mentioned the chairs were uncomfortable. Now he's in a big Lily Tomlin
82620	91980	overstuffed prop sofa. I hope you get lumbar problems tonight. I hope that's too much comfort
91980	98860	for this podcast. More lumbar, more lumbar problems. You guys want to go to lumbar later in Silver
98860	106860	Lake? What if it came out clean? Okay. What? Nothing. It's a hipster bar. It's all about
106860	119060	lower back support and infusion drinks. Lumbar. Yeah. All right. I feel like there's a voice in
119060	129060	my head that says, Harmon, you're going to fuck this up. But I keep every week that goes by and
129060	136260	I don't bring this up. Another week goes by where it's like footprints in the snow. I had this
136260	144540	experience at a bar in Burbank and I wrote down the kind of flow chart through it. I was there
144540	150260	with a friend who kind of like I digested it with him afterwards. I got it all down accurately. And
150260	160500	I wanted to just relay this like fan encounter I had. I'm not sure now. And then the only reason
160500	168540	I want to do it is because I just found it incredibly fascinating. And it probably goes
168540	175580	without saying, but I'll say it anyway, that I have no problem how you approach me. It would be
175580	188140	weird to punch me. A lot of people make jokes. If it's helpful to you to understand, I could tell
188140	195740	you that there's things that are like, oh, how am I supposed to react to that? But I also, you get
195740	200540	one thing like I've made, I kind of want to run through all of the things I cringe about when I
200540	208060	think about like, like so many times I've been near anybody. And I've just, I just had that urge to
208060	215260	like, you know, like, Hey, what am I going to be in the same billiard hall as this person? And I'm
215260	221500	not going to bother to like that. I'm gonna tell JK Rollins, what's up? Yeah, I'm gonna, like,
222220	227580	that's JK Rollins. And I'll even be the first to say, like, like, you maybe you maybe you haven't
227580	231260	even read Harry Potter, and that happens. And you're kind of like, there's a little blurry line.
231260	236220	But I will say the people that usually come up to me, because I'm not like, you know, if you
236220	244300	recognize my face in a bar, probably means that you're, you're kind of deep in and it's usually
244300	248940	a very pleasant experience. And sometimes it's a little socially awkward. I think I could name two
249020	256300	times when the including now this last time, this is two in like 10 years, where I've been like,
256300	262940	well, that guy is kind of evil and a dick. But both times, I don't think the person didn't really
262940	267740	know me that they're not so it's like they they and I've done that too. I remember in Milwaukee,
267740	274380	we were famous for one of our exports was a band called the Bo Deans. What was the what was their
274380	280300	big famous song? Bo Deen. Oh, I'm looking for a runaway. All right, she's gonna take my heart away
281100	291740	for me. I'm gonna get the runaway. I'm a Bo Deen. Yeah. And I was at my the the the drawing room of
291740	300140	Milwaukee, which was called the uptowner and a very fancy place. And it wasn't I there was a,
300700	305580	there was a guy drinking at the end of the bar. And a friend of mine said, that's so and so from
305580	312860	the Bo Deens. And they gave me a name. And, and I went up to them. My mom loved that song. I'm
312860	318780	looking for a hideaway kind of get a runaway and I was I lived in Milwaukee. I did I was 19 years
318780	324220	old, I shouldn't have been at a bar, but he and I was like, I went up and I said like Jimmy or Jody
324220	331660	or GG or whatever the name was. My mom's a big fan of your band. Could I get an autograph? And he
331660	336220	signed some shit that I looked at later. And it was basically like, go fuck yourself or something
336220	340860	like like, like not not not like aggressive, but it was sort of like whatever I had said to him,
340860	344780	it was you know, it's kind of clear that he was like, here's what you get for not knowing who I
344780	351900	am. What my song is and telling me your mom likes me like here's your fucking, you know, worthless
351900	356140	thing for sure. You're not walking out of here with anything worth anything. Yeah. And I remember
356140	363580	that still because I'm embarrassed that I did that. But like, do I I mean, therefore, I guess I
363580	369900	should say not but I I don't I don't judge anybody, whoever like kind of maybe has like a moment where
369900	377020	they're like, Oh, my God, like it's you. It's like such a flattering thing, obviously. And and if they
377020	381580	then like have spit come out of their mouth or they or they or they do the mental equivalent,
381580	387020	which is like they try to nag me, you know, like there's some people that do that. They're like,
387020	391900	people think sometimes if they're rude to celebrities, it'll be cool. I mean, so I feel
391900	396940	like I hopefully have disclaimed that enough to say like, this is not me going like I met the
396940	405180	biggest douchebag. And here's blow by blow everything he did wrong. But it is that but
405180	412780	it's like it's not that is not it's just I still I if this guy was listening, I would want him to
412780	417980	know. And I at the point of the story, there's no way this guy's listening. The I would also I
417980	421740	would want to know you did nothing wrong. You don't have to. You could erase this from your
421740	430220	head. It is not on your karma. So you were at a bar and somebody came up to you and started talking
430540	433180	Yeah, I'm just trying to. Okay, so that was the setup.
439420	443100	I'm trying to figure out what to type so I can find it. I'm never going to find it.
445420	450860	Are you? Are you? No.
452220	456540	Shrob, do you have any advice for people who come up to celebrities?
456540	464460	Do I have any advice? No, well, Dan searches. Not really. I mean, I think we just told the
464460	470540	we told the company story last time, right? Yeah, we told that story. I think we were we were having
470540	476140	we were having a pretty good time. That was a pretty historical night for me at least. Yeah,
476140	479660	that red buttons. Tony. Oh, no, you're talking. You're thinking of Hasselhoff. That's the Hasselhoff
479660	484220	story. We've also told that a couple of times. Yeah. What's the finish of this story? Oh,
484380	489100	the company story. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We told that here. Yeah, we told it here.
490540	493980	What about the finish to this story? Okay, all right. All right. All right. Okay.
493980	499580	You're not getting out of this. You're not getting out of this one. All right. So I'm going from
499580	503660	memory because I was like, in my mind, it's like a it's like a flow chart where every time this
503660	512300	guy has a chance to like go left, but he drills down. Okay, so I'm sitting at this billiard hall
512300	520140	in Burbank where I write most of Rick and Morty and I like there's this it's sometimes
520140	524540	inexplicably in Burbank there's this like I don't know if it's like billiard leagues or something
524540	531500	like the place is packed and I'm like typing and then as a guy comes up and I see him peripherally
531500	539980	and he's kind of like he's he's he's bobbing and weaving and he's like captivated. And then he
539980	547500	he walks away for a second. He comes back and he goes, Excuse me. Has anybody ever told you,
547500	557980	you look exactly like Justin Roiland. And I think I've I think I've gotten that one before
557980	565340	like like as a as a bit now now now zoom in on my flow chart where you go. Okay, like this could be
565420	572940	this could be a great guy, right? That could be a funny bit, right? Of course. It actually didn't
572940	579420	even occur to me that it did not occur to me. I assumed automatically I was I was like, Okay,
579420	587420	what he means is a big fan of your your who you are and not that I would mind if he
587980	592380	who deigned to not recognize me because someone else that would be fine too, but it didn't occur
592460	597260	to me. I just assume I processed it like he's doing a bit. He doesn't want to he doesn't want
597260	601980	to be regular, right? He wants to do it. He wants to be he wants to be fun. And and I could just
601980	611660	laugh it down. I could go ha ha ha. And I go, Yeah, I get that a lot. So that's me. Yes. Anding
612460	615500	him. I get that a lot. And then and then and then he goes,
616300	623100	uh, uh, uh, wait, God damn it. See, the thing is, I needed my fucking notes because it's like
623100	628060	he did so many things wrong, so many things. And they were all like one after another. The first
628060	634940	one. Oh, but I can't I skip if I could skip too easily because he just I mean, I should I should
634940	640540	bail on the whole thing. Can we can we just try one more time? All right. Well, that's just because
641260	646300	let me let me think about it. Just like don't don't give us advice. Help me with my phobia
646300	651420	of uncomfortable pauses. We got you. Let me advice and take off your shirt.
653100	660940	Ha ha ha. No cold. Um, okay. Okay. Yes. He's a genius. Drop is a genius. That's good. That's
660940	665740	good. Okay. So he said you just arrived and I said, Yeah, I get that a lot, which had just
665740	669580	occurred to me. And now I remember like, well, yes, that's yes. Ending the joke. But it's also
670220	678540	if it's technically in a technical narrative, it's saying, I'm not who you think I am. Yes. So he
678540	687100	reacted as if that were the case and and just went like, Okay, and walked away. But he like did like
687100	694220	a two foot lap like around like an invisible sunflower that he was pollinating. That was just
694220	699020	like his own self loathing or something or like the ghost of his dad. I don't know. And then like,
699580	708540	then he came back and he like, he was like, No, no, it is you. It's you. I do. I know you
708540	715020	anywhere. And I was like, Yeah, yeah. Hey, how are you doing? And he's like, Dude, Justin,
715020	721900	what are you doing here? Oh, shit. And I was like, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I work here. I
721900	727980	work or work. And, and he and he goes, he goes, he goes, Well, I don't know that.
730060	734700	I'm not some sycophantic fucking ass kiss fan. I don't, I don't like worship your fucking life
734700	738940	and know every goddamn detail of it. And I was like, that's cool. You don't have to.
740620	746300	Did you? But it is Los Angeles. And I, what am I, what am I doing here?
746300	750940	I thought you would, I thought you would shake him down in Justin's voice.
752380	757740	Because he doesn't know anyways, but, but, but, but why didn't you just say I'm not
757740	762780	Justin? You're wrong about that shit too, bitch. No, no, that's not fair. You don't,
762780	768300	you don't have to say, no, I beg your pardon. I am not because, because I also, I didn't.
768300	772220	But he shit on you once he shit on you. Can't you be like motherfucker? You don't even know
772220	776060	who you're talking to? No, cause well, wait a minute. I'm going to be right about this.
776060	781260	You're going to see because, because yeah, he shit on me. I'm thinking what I'm thinking
781260	787740	at this point is he he's he's going to be embarrassed at some point and I could keep
787740	790780	him from embarrassment. You know, it's like the, like a parsley in your teeth,
790780	793740	but it's like if someone with parsley in their teeth was like biting you,
794620	800300	like he's, he's, he's already being a bad person. So I was like, well, good. I can't wait for you
800300	808220	to get the selfie, tag it and, and feel like a terrible piece of shit. Just enough. Like it's
808220	814220	fine. And then every, all justice is done. And, and then, and so he, there were some other things he
814220	818540	got dammit. I swear they were like 90 fucking things. And I was like, really that decision,
818540	823340	that choice. That's amazing. Like, like, like you, like, like the flow chart just has these clear,
823340	826940	like the, you know, like the thing goes, this is like two of them, you know, one that like,
827180	833500	you actually kept it going after he was being aggressive. I didn't keep shit going. I'm a dude
833500	838860	sitting at a bar. Did you shut it down? Did you shut something down? You, that's you being like,
838860	842860	I kind of respect that you were like in for the bit so you could fuck him up with this selfie.
842860	847420	That is some game master type shit. I will always, yes. And you, I'm never going to be like,
847420	854460	excuse me, I'm eating. Like, like if I, that means like my mom died or like you have a hockey mask
854460	859260	on, I don't know. Like, like, I'm never going to be like, I don't consider that fair to like turn
859260	865420	me into the, you know, like to put that on me, that I have to become the person that, that, that
865420	870140	radiates negativity because you decided to pee in the pool, you know? Like, I'm just like,
871020	875980	best I could do is be like, I'm swimming in pee now. So I love it. So after he was like,
875980	880620	going, I'm not some kind of sycophant or blah, blah, blah, blah, you went, you just went,
880620	885260	okay. I was like, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's what you would do too. It's, you know,
885260	888860	and you and I are not good people. We're passive aggressive. We're from Wisconsin.
889900	895180	I've seen you interact with a million terrible people. And you always do the exact same thing.
895180	900380	The shittier they get, the more you're like, okay, yeah, all right. Yeah. And then you'll throw in
900380	904140	something like, like, if they're giving you a note on your comic book, you'll go like, okay, yeah,
904140	909020	well, I'm probably going to keep doing whatever the fuck I wanted to do. But it was nice talking to
909020	913260	you, you know, like that's, but I don't have anything to say in this situation because he's
913260	920220	not telling me how to do the voices better. Okay. So, so keep doing whatever the fuck you want to do.
921020	928140	What? Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. Game, record, math, game.
928140	936780	To Dan. All right. What is that? What is, what is that? Is that a candle?
936780	943980	It's a hot signature. It's a hot signature. All right. Let me just, let me just like teleport to
943980	951260	the end and we'll bring our guests out. It's a hot signature. I got the thing that blew my mind is
951260	957260	he goes like, Hey, let me get a, like, can I get a selfie with you? And I was like, yeah, no problem.
957260	963580	And I took the selfie with, and it's not a selfie. I guess it is. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
963580	968060	sorry. I shouldn't be doing that. And then, and then, and then he, and then he walked away and
968060	972300	my Mike, Mike Waldron and I were sitting there, we're working on Rick and Morty and I was like,
972300	975740	and we, he was marveling at the whole thing and we were comparing notes and it was like,
975740	981660	he was like, well, how often? And it was like, not, not like that. No. And, uh, and he's like,
981660	989900	so he's gonna, he's gonna go post it, tag it. And if I know, if I know our fan base,
989900	994940	like he's going to know in five seconds that he should kill himself and die by fire and all this
994940	1004460	stuff. Um, but the crazy thing is that the guy, the guy absolutely, like it was a selfie on the
1004460	1009020	way out. Like he was there for stuff. And then he was like, one last thing. Can I get a picture?
1009100	1012780	That was the thing. Like he waited till the end. Cause why wouldn't you? And then he, and then he,
1012780	1016620	and then he, and so then he left and it was like, we really thought I was like, I was like,
1016620	1022940	and so that the epilogue of that story will be forever unseen. And, uh, and then, and then,
1022940	1029900	and then, but then five minutes later he came back and he was like, dude, Dan,
1029900	1038460	I just wanted to, uh, congratulate you on out trolling me on that joke I was doing
1039180	1045500	where I pretended to think you were Justin and you fucking just stuck it out. And, uh,
1046300	1049900	that I didn't think you'd do that, but that was, uh, you know, congratulations.
1049900	1053100	That was amazing. You know, but whatever. I knew who you were the whole time.
1053100	1061180	Yeah. Well guess what? Amateur hour. Fucking with a real comedian and you're walking up with
1061180	1067660	your whack ass basement bargain joke. It was cute until you got aggressive. But now that you've met
1067660	1075420	the real Dan Harmon and fucked up in front of him, I leave. But you know, you know, he was just come
1075420	1081420	over and say, can I buy you a drink motherfucker? But you know, he wasn't, he wasn't because I
1081500	1088060	ran through this a thousand times, like he, he was, he was, he was, he was revising. He came back
1088860	1094700	to salvage completely needless, like salvage. He's like, you didn't have anything to salvage
1094700	1099980	ever. Like, like, what do you, you're like, that was the mind blower. But in whose eyes was like,
1099980	1104460	Oh, remember that guy? Hey, remember me like this. I'm not going to remember. I'm going to get,
1104460	1107340	I'm not even going to remember the details of the story while I'm shit talking, you know,
1108300	1110860	uh, damn, dude, I'm blowing up.
1113420	1114060	Shit, it's him.
1116700	1120300	Heard you in real time. Justin didn't like what you said.
1121740	1126620	And it was, it was a, it was a bad, it was a, I will forever regret this. Uh, cause I, I, I was,
1126620	1130460	I was like, I knew it. It's been like three weeks. I was like, Oh, you never told that story. I would
1130460	1134300	have had like some, I wouldn't, I would have had the whole thing in my head. It was, it's bad
1134380	1141660	podcasting, but that's why you're here. Uh, I mean, otherwise you're just, you're, you're, you're,
1141660	1146060	you're, you're experimenting. I guess you're walking around downtown and you're like,
1146060	1151340	let's go to a podcast. We don't know what's bad yet. Let's see if it's bad. If those people I
1151340	1155500	feel bad for the rest of you, you're getting what you paid for. You know that. Um, but, uh,
1155500	1161100	sometimes we also have guests come on. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, this one is no exception.
1165020	1172540	Just gets better and better. Really. Really. That was a fun, like kind of alt comedy intro.
1172540	1177580	Yeah. Uh, I wrote a new dry alt comedy and kind of like, wait, I'm introducing people.
1180780	1185980	Um, I, I just, I, I, this is one of those, one of those, one of those, one of those shows that
1185980	1189100	I've been hearing about forever. That's always like, you should watch this. It's really funny.
1189100	1194060	I could see from the ads. It probably was never did just dove into it. I fully admittedly,
1194060	1198540	because he was coming to the, to the show. I'm so impressed with his stuff. Can't wait to talk to
1198540	1203020	him about it and other stuff. Cause there's a lot of stuff he's able to talk about and he ruins it
1203020	1220220	all. Please welcome Adam Conover from Adam ruins everything. Hi everybody. Oh, so nice to be here.
1220940	1225820	What do they call? What do they call a person that is it a polydact? Is that a word? Uh,
1225820	1232140	yeah. Would that be like a person who's got, uh, more than one hand? Oh, no. I think it's a person
1232140	1236780	who knows more than one thing. Is that, is that, will that be polydact? I think so. I think so.
1236780	1244460	Polymath, polymath. I think it might be polymath. Um, anyways, uh, yeah, thank you. This has been
1244460	1251020	great. I watched like five episodes of your show today popped around multiple seasons and stuff. I
1251020	1258540	was really, really, uh, impressed now. And we'll get the plugging out of the way is that it's a,
1258540	1263020	it may be an ill timed plug, but like there's stuff coming up in July. Was that it? Yeah. Yeah.
1263020	1268700	We've got new episodes. Uh, we got new episodes up in July. Uh, we are on Netflix now, which is very
1268700	1272620	exciting. And we also have new episodes coming out at the end of March on Netflix. They're not
1272620	1277900	new, but they're new to Netflix. So, but it's weird because people who just have Netflix are
1277900	1282300	like behind everybody else, but they don't even know that there's more episodes of the show to
1282300	1288300	watch. It's a very strange state of affairs. That's cool. Cause, uh, yeah. And that satisfaction of
1288300	1294700	when that Netflix seal opens and you know, you're going to get like 0.03 cents of more.
1294700	1299500	Is that what happens? We have not, we have not gotten a, or like a residuals round on it. Yes.
1299500	1303660	I don't know how that, I don't know that Netflix doesn't do back end. If you didn't get any money
1303660	1308780	the day Netflix came into your life, then you're never going to see any, it means they just, they
1308780	1314380	just came in your window and took your dresser. It's a weird, you wanted people to see you.
1316140	1320780	Yeah. It's really weird. The, the, the state of affairs of being like a modern
1320780	1326380	creative person is like just hoping that a platform bestows it's unearned like sea of
1326460	1333180	eyeballs on you and like a windfall. And then hoping to God, it doesn't go away for no reason
1333180	1337340	later that you don't get fucked by some algorithm tweak that they made to try to
1337340	1342140	stop anti-vaxxers or something. Suddenly no one's watching you now. It's a bizarre.
1342140	1347260	What's the, what's the viewership like on true TV? What kind of world are you mired in? Are they,
1347260	1354620	are they, are they, are they, are they, are you mired or are you more in a quagma and are you,
1354700	1359100	I'm just being like, do you get emails that are like, well 0.7 last night,
1359100	1363260	not as good as we hoped, but is it still that world in basic cable or?
1363260	1369340	Yeah. I mean, it's, I don't know the, you know, I sort of don't find out the week to week, you know,
1369340	1374140	I get told, Hey, the premiere was good. And then I get told later on, you know, Oh, we did a,
1374140	1378300	you know, you did okay. Or it was flat or flat or whatever. But I mean, the numbers are crazy.
1378300	1383420	Like we heard last year that like, Oh, well, you know, uh, we, you know, the,
1383420	1388380	the numbers were, uh, the, it was flat. Your ratings didn't go up from year two to year three.
1388380	1392140	Right. And I was like, Oh, that's a little disappointing. And then I found out later
1392140	1398060	that the ratings for all of cable television had dropped 10% in one year. So we were flat.
1398060	1402300	We went up like we're, we're beating everybody else. It's like, I keep telling you people about
1402300	1409020	my weight. I'm 46 years old. If I get a little bit fatter, that means I'm like, fucking like
1409020	1414380	ripped. Like I'm like, I'm like actively not acroiting, like I'm not exploding into it.
1414380	1419660	Anyways, but that was the same as like, like when I was at NBC, it was like, but except the worst
1419660	1425260	part was like, they didn't, that at least you could, well, you said you found out later, but like,
1425260	1431500	it was, it was years of Venice sinking and being measured as sinking, but everyone just kept
1431500	1436300	blaming the shows. Like, yeah. I was like, how can you blame all of the shows for all shows
1436300	1442460	failing in ratings? Like if it, if the office is also failing by the same amount, you have to take
1442460	1447340	that part off of yelling at me now. Now they're starting to, I am totally with that. And now
1447340	1452060	they're, they're starting to get it. And I have conversations with TV executives more where they
1452060	1457260	say like, yeah, you know, we gotta, we gotta get on some new platforms. I mean, cable television
1457260	1463020	just is not doing well. I'm like, you're a cable executive. Where are you going to go?
1464060	1468860	I just found out my company's buying an oil company. Uh, next week, like a pretty soon we're
1468860	1474380	going to be timed Warner mobile. Um, they're, they're trying to start, you know, Turner's starting
1474380	1480940	a streaming service sometime, hopefully before, uh, LA collapses into the ocean. And, uh, I think
1480940	1485260	that's their next big thing, but we're doing, I mean, look, we have true TV is a great audience,
1485260	1489180	you know, uh, and practical jokers is on our network. And that's the best thing ever,
1489180	1493900	because in practical jokers, if you guys have seen the show, wonderful show, wonderful prank show,
1493900	1500700	they run it like 23 and a half hours a day. It's just true TV is on demand and practical jokers.
1500700	1504780	And it's one of the most popular shows on cable, right? And then people who are just sitting there
1504780	1508220	watching practical jokers. And after a while, my show comes on and they're going, Oh, what's this?
1508220	1513180	Hey, I like that too. And so that's good for me. We always have the best leading on the network,
1513180	1517660	no matter what happens. And your, yours isn't, yours isn't constantly being run.
1517660	1521740	Cause that's another factor. Yeah. They do run. They, they, we do pretty good on reruns too.
1521740	1525180	They give us, you know, they'll do two hour blocks throughout the year and stuff like that.
1525180	1528940	I'll say adult swim. They don't, they don't either. Maybe this is privileged. Maybe because
1528940	1534140	we're a gigantic hit. You're welcome. Uh, yeah, I don't think it is because I mean, we were,
1534140	1541740	I mean, I don't swim. Never. They, I haven't heard a goddamn decimal number since I left NBC.
1541740	1546460	Really? I adult swims. Well, they're making their money a thousand ways. They've got it,
1546460	1551660	you know, like you're, you're on lunch boxes, not lunch boxes, but they run their programming.
1551660	1557420	And like, yeah, just on this big round clock, a big round clock. Um, Harmon explains television.
1559500	1563180	But then, and then, and then, and then, so how would you even be able to yell at anybody like,
1563180	1567580	Oh, it looks like you're taking a dip. It's like, what, what, what dip? Like maybe, maybe, maybe
1567580	1573100	you've accidentally adequately captured the appeal of the show. Maybe 80 people want to
1573100	1578780	watch it at nine AM and then another 10 people want to watch it an hour later. Um, but anyways,
1578780	1584460	but, uh, I, I, I just, well, so that that's, that's us ruining television. Maybe ruining is a cable,
1584460	1590700	but, um, I'm very happy to be surviving in the, it's so it's, there's, it, everything is exploding
1590700	1594620	right now in a million ways and everything's being disrupted. So it's, I'm very happy to just be
1594620	1599340	surviving at all. It's a great, it's a great show. That's the, that's the, that's the important
1599340	1605980	news is the creatively and I, biggest compliment, uh, I, I have is that I was so, I had so much
1605980	1611660	shit to do today. I, I, I, I'm in, I'm in big trouble. I'm like, I'm like really, really behind
1611660	1616620	on a draft and I wasn't using you to procrastinate because I really did want to finish my fucking
1616620	1621820	draft, but I knew I had to watch at least an episode of your show and I, and I, and I did,
1621820	1627500	and then I watched five and I, I, I only, I had to peel myself away. I was really, I really like it.
1630220	1633900	Let's figure out later if this was a good or a bad idea. How many people in the audience by applause
1633900	1639580	have seen this show? Oh my gosh. That's pretty nice. I mean, I, that's a win-win if there's
1639580	1645100	anybody, if you're focusing on the negative space, that means potential. Yeah. That's now that now
1645100	1648700	we're, now we're marketing. Yeah. Those other people are like, well, what are the clapping
1648700	1654620	people know? I don't know. Uh, I want to be a clapping person. One, one, one reason why maybe
1654620	1660860	people, I, to, to use my eye statements, like I think a reason I didn't, I didn't flock to it
1660860	1668300	is I, I live in fear of my own cynicism and stuff. I struggle so hard to stay positive and believe in
1668300	1675260	humanity and stuff. And, uh, I remember, I think the dark kind of club footed cousin of your show
1675260	1681820	is Penn and Teller's bullshit on Showtime. Yeah. I, I have a, I loved that show when it came out.
1681820	1686700	And, uh, but there were certain things that that there are certain things totally that that show
1686700	1691100	did that I knew that I wanted to do something a little bit different from. Um, but I love,
1691100	1696140	I'm a huge fan of Penn and Teller. Um, and, uh, and what those guys do, their show in Vegas is
1696140	1700540	incredible. If you've, if you've never seen it, um, uh, little myth busters in there as well.
1700540	1705500	And oh, and myth busters in terms of influence on, on our show, uh, a little bit, except we're
1705500	1710460	not, we never do experiments and things like that. I'm like not handy at all. You know,
1710460	1715580	um, like there's no like live demos. Um, but, uh, yeah, a little bit, you know, but I do think,
1715580	1720300	I think the, the, the incredible exception that made a difference, which is immediately apparent
1720300	1725100	from the pilot. And then it's there in every show. I mean, one of the things is that tonally
1725100	1730620	there is just a clear difference in that it's like comedy versus tragedy kind of thing. Like,
1730620	1737260	it's like at the end of the day, either your show believes the viewer should kill themselves or not.
1739180	1745260	And, and your show, like it has this, it, it has this heart to it. In fact, it's inviting people
1745260	1750860	up to skepticism and sentences. If it's not implying that, uh, if you didn't already know
1750860	1758300	this, you it's because you're dumb and, um, and, and also like, um, now that you know this,
1758300	1763340	you know that life means less. Yeah, it's the opposite. I mean, the, the, one of the mottos
1763340	1767820	of the show is that my character has and that I have personally is it's always better to know
1767820	1771980	that I don't believe that there's any, you know, there's any virtue and ignorance whatsoever and
1771980	1775980	that you're always better knowing the truth. And the reason is because that makes you more
1775980	1782700	powerful and capable and you know, more able in the world. Um, and so we wanted to make a show
1782700	1788460	that, that shows that, um, but I'm not a negative or cynical person by nature. Um, and so it was
1788460	1793020	important to us to have that positive thing at the end. Although I think it was actually on the
1793020	1796700	pilot, I think it was the best network note I've ever gotten where they were like, you need something
1796700	1801980	positive at the end. Like the four were a four act show. And they were like, the fourth act should
1801980	1807580	be just an uplifting message of some kind, you know? Um, and that's the best on paper. That sounds
1807580	1812780	like the prototypical terrible studio. Yeah, exactly. Like, Oh, come on. I gotta find a
1812780	1820380	positive spin every time. Can they can, can, can, can, can, can, can, uh, I, I was going to try to
1820380	1824460	riff the name of like a character. That's like a guy you love to hate. I was like, can Rick, can
1824460	1829420	Rick from Rick and Marty, can he be good at his job? I don't know. I was like, dog that he loves
1829420	1833660	just to show us that, you know, it sounds too Pollyanna-ish, but in this case, what was the
1833660	1841100	hardest, uh, positive fourth act piece? Like, what was the hardest one you think you did that,
1841100	1845740	or are they all like, Oh, it's actually, there's always something positive on each one.
1845740	1849500	There's somewhere, the ones that work the best are where there's a specific thing that people
1849500	1853180	can do where it's like, now that you know this, instead of doing the bad thing that you were doing
1853180	1856620	before, here's the good thing that you can do. You know, instead of like giving, you know, instead
1856620	1861580	of buying Tom shoes and our pilot, you can give money to people directly. And that's much better
1861580	1866460	for them. Right. Um, the hard ones are where it's like really diffuse, like what the solution is.
1866460	1873020	Um, like our climate change episodes are the most difficult ones. And we did this whole episode
1873020	1879660	where about climate change, um, that, uh, was very important to me. We did it in, uh, 2016
1879660	1885340	and the big takeaway at the end. And this was like literally me go that a lot of times I'm
1885340	1890700	working through it myself. You know, um, like I, I was literally wrestling with what the fuck are
1890700	1895980	we going to do about climate change? No one is making any progress. Um, how do I think about
1895980	1901340	this? Because it seems really dire. And we talked to this, um, uh, climate, uh, thinker and philosopher
1901340	1905740	Dale Jamison who made the point that like, look, it's not when people talk about climate change
1905740	1910140	and they say the end of the world is coming. If we don't do this, the world is going to end. That's
1910140	1915100	always false. Right. Um, you can always make a choice today to make a better tomorrow. No matter
1915100	1918860	how things, no matter how bad things are going to get, you're never off the hook. Right. Um, because
1918860	1922700	there's no, there's no such thing as the apocalypse, right? Because they'll always be people who are
1922700	1927020	living. Um, and he said the best reason to be positive is because of the Paris agreement,
1927020	1931340	because every country came together and it just happened. Every country came together and made
1931340	1935420	this agreement. And so we did an episode where we talked about that, you know, that, that was the
1935420	1939980	fourth act. Thank God for the Paris agreement, because this is the best sign we've ever had.
1940620	1947660	And then, and then, and then between shooting and airing was November, 2016. Um, and, uh,
1947660	1952940	we had to release a, we released a little bumper at the end, which was like, okay, so the Paris
1952940	1959660	agreement is, uh, uh, we're kind of worried about it now. And, um, you should like phone call
1959660	1967100	somebody call, get one of those apps and call it Congress person. Fuck, you know, um, you got a
1967100	1979980	little Bobcat there. Oh, shit. Yeah. I, I become Bobcat Goldway. The, uh, the, uh, the, the, the
1979980	1986700	episode that really, uh, I, I, I, the five I watched, but I, I saw obviously when the title of
1986700	1992060	the episode is different, I'm like, okay, I'm zooming in on that. And, uh, there's this character,
1992060	1997420	Emily in the show, who's your oft antagonist slash whatever ruining everything for her.
1997420	2004060	And she, she wrote with you on the original college humor series. He said, um, and, uh,
2004060	2009420	plays herself or, you know, her name's Emily. She's not playing herself. Uh, she's playing a
2010300	2015340	based on her loosely. Yeah. But that she's, um, uh, you know, she, she gets these episodes where
2015340	2021660	she gets to ruin you. Yeah. And, um, which is a combination of a corrections, uh, segment,
2022620	2027420	which your character is excited about, which I was really impressed by. I thought there was
2027420	2033660	such great meta storytelling. Like I, I love, I'm really impressed with the amount of character
2033660	2038380	that you're doing in a show. That's just like a true TV. Like, Hey, it's me. This is my name.
2038380	2043660	And here's the thing I'm going to ruin. It's like, you have arcs and, and each episode has a story
2043660	2049580	to it. Like there's, and this is so cathartic for someone to finally, cause nobody points out
2049580	2053580	this part of the show to me very rarely. Does someone say, Oh, I like the story arcs, you know,
2053580	2057260	and we put so much work into that part of the show. I truly believe that, that everyone
2058940	2062780	notices it, enjoys it, but they don't in the back of their minds. Yeah. Because they're,
2062780	2071100	they're inferior non-elites. Um, they don't have our galaxy Hollywood brands. They haven't earned
2071740	2076460	the conscious pleasure, uh, but they're allowed the unconscious.
2078220	2081260	They feel it deep down in their animal brain stems. It's the,
2081260	2084780	it's the scars on my back that are shaped like Joseph Campbell circles
2085900	2093260	that the wounds allow his work to seep in on every level. For you, you'll think, Ooh,
2093260	2104780	I like this show. I know why. Um, but, uh, it really, I truly, it really, I, I, I,
2104780	2111900	here's the thing. Like I, it for a non-fiction show to like, I'm like, it was like, it was a
2111900	2119420	little, it reminded me of Dr. Who kind of like, like, because there's consistency to your character
2119420	2124620	and you have a companion. Yeah. And she was like, it's my turn to fuck with you,
2124620	2129020	which is like, first of all, here's all the shit that people have corrected us on that we did in
2129020	2136140	the past. And, but here's the really impressive thing to me as a master storyteller. In the first
2136140	2142060	act of that story, Adam is like, Oh, goodie. I love being ruined because it's like the Adam's
2142060	2145580	family, right? Like, like, Hey, what if you ruined a ruiner with a ruiner would love it.
2145580	2149900	He loves ruination. Hello, good, more ruining. And I was like, well, it's probably going to
2149900	2153980	just be the thing, right? She's going to get increasingly frustrated. But then there's this
2153980	2159100	threshold that's crossed where they, they get, they get through the corrections and they start
2159100	2163500	talking about this thing called the backfire effect, which is a thing you may have heard about
2163500	2168860	probably since the election. Um, uh, or maybe, I mean, maybe not, not by that name, but this idea
2168940	2176140	that, um, uh, when we, uh, when we're, when we're emotionally connected to something that we believe,
2176140	2181420	um, uh, unlike with something else, like if I said, what's that you're eating? And you go
2181420	2187020	slim gyms. And I go, you know, it's better is slim gyms ultra. If you don't care, you're probably
2187020	2191580	going to be like, I'll try those. Yeah. Um, you love those conversations. Like, what are you
2191580	2196540	listening to? The pixies that you should listen to the pugs. Okay. Uh, they both have pee in them.
2197260	2200700	I wish we had used these act notes on the show. These would have been a great demonstration.
2201900	2206300	The backfire effect happens when you tell somebody as the obvious example is who'd you
2206300	2214380	vote for? Oh, yeah. Natalie Portman. Well, she rapes children. Um, you should, and she pollutes
2214380	2219340	the rivers and, um, you didn't know that. And so you should vote for Bernie. Uh, I'm trying to
2219340	2226460	change the name so that we don't, Bernie Sanderson, Natalie Portman and Bernie Sanderson.
2227420	2229260	I'm not good at names.
2233100	2235420	Everybody in your shows is just named to who they were named.
2235420	2239260	I was trying to imagine someone's like, no queen. She was good as queen on my dollar.
2240140	2246460	Is that her? Okay. Thank God. Um, but they, they, it actually, not only is there a deflector shield,
2246460	2252940	yeah, actually studies have shown that if you just lob a kind of like you're wrong about everything,
2252940	2258380	the earth is actually round at a flat earth or if, or if they're a flat earther that has linked
2258380	2263740	their fucking sexuality or their, their heart to flat earth, which how else would you be a flat?
2263740	2267020	And it can be even more powerful than that. My favorite example that I've ever heard is like,
2267020	2272220	imagine Sean Hannity, right? If Sean Hannity woke up tomorrow and read a study that convinced him
2272220	2276620	climate change was real and we had to do everything to stop it now, right? His whole life is based
2276620	2281980	around the opposite. His career is his family, his relationships to his friends are, you know,
2281980	2285980	if he was like, no, no, I think climate change is real. He'd become a pariah among everybody.
2285980	2289740	He knew it's not just his emotional identity. It's his social identity. It's everything he
2289740	2295820	is as a person. So there's no way for him to get heart and soul and testicles. Like your,
2295820	2299740	your, it could be your wallet. It could be your social standing. It could be anything.
2299740	2307980	If there's an investment there, the, the, the invasion of, of an alternative fact can actually
2307980	2313180	make you just double down. It's almost like your muscles, your muscles tense up. And, and, uh,
2314780	2319180	so not only was this an incredible episode, just to learn about this stuff in a digestible way,
2319180	2324620	but also that I'm watching it as master storyteller, um, your character in the show,
2324620	2331100	that's the threshold he crosses where he's like, I don't want to hear about this because it implies
2331100	2335740	that your show doesn't have any value, which is what my identity, both the characters that
2336140	2341340	my own personal identity is wrapped up in the premise that the show doesn't mean anything
2342460	2349500	is how you get Dr. Who to like question himself. And I love that so much. And it all happens just
2349500	2353340	within one boxing ring with Emily just dressed and she's just punching you in the face telling you.
2353340	2358220	So it's not about like, uh, there didn't need to be a car chase in order for this to be like a
2358220	2364540	dynamic story. I thought it was really cool. And I'm learning this amazing thing, which it, uh,
2364540	2374060	okay. Harmon, uh, landed, uh, use a period. The backfire effect though. So how do we,
2374060	2377900	oh, oh, oh, the one, it was like, as it is explained in your show, the reason for the
2377900	2382140	backfire effect, the software we're working with, or maybe we should call it the hardware. Yeah. The
2382140	2390060	hardware, um, the emotional wires, they run faster than the logical ones, but you're never going to
2390060	2397100	win. Like we may as well just accept that humans are passionate, illogical. Well, and if we do that,
2397100	2401020	then it, that gives us the tools that we need to overcome the backfire effect, right? Like that. My
2401020	2407420	favorite thing, uh, about the, uh, segment was, you know, we went, uh, this guy who we interviewed
2407420	2412300	on the show, Steven Lewandowski, um, and his, uh, partners in academia wrote like a debunkers
2412300	2416540	handbook. Um, and you know, that explains here's how to debunk things better. Um, and it's a lot
2416540	2420300	of stuff we already do on the show. And the thing that sticks with me the most is it's about the
2420300	2424460	power of stories, right? Um, that, uh, people so often when they believe something that's wrong,
2424460	2430380	they have a story about it. Like here's, and you know, you just, uh, like any fact that you know,
2430380	2435340	you probably have a story for how things got that way, right? America is like this because
2435340	2438940	George Washington chopped down the thing and the person with the thing and whatever. Right. Um,
2438940	2444700	and so if you can replace the bad story, the incorrect story with a story that is both truer
2444700	2449420	and more interesting, right? That's how you, uh, can convince them. And when he told me that,
2449420	2453820	I was like, Oh, that's the, that's our fucking show. That's like all we do. Black History,
2453820	2461100	Rosa Parks. Yeah. Uh, uh, okay. Let's, let's do it. I'm, I'm ready. I'm white and I'm ready to talk
2461100	2469580	about it. Happy February, Brandon. Um, can we give you like a list? Can we give you like a list of
2469580	2478620	things to, to, that you could ruin right here tonight? If we do that now, then I'll be the
2478620	2482380	guy that just pointed at people snapped and said, black history, Rosa Parks. And then we moved on.
2483500	2488060	I have to just explain that I, I, I've been, I've been doing like an hour of reading in the
2488060	2493020	mornings before my Instagram workouts. Now I have more to explain, but I won't. Um, but, uh,
2493020	2497420	I'm proud of you. But then I, I, I initially, here's the, here's the path that I went through.
2497420	2502700	I'm going to be a hipster, uh, artisanal black historian for my workout. So why would I do
2502700	2507660	anything that we learned about in high school? So let's skip Rosa Parks. Then I think, first of all,
2507660	2512380	that probably takes a lot of work. How do you skip Rosa Parks? Probably by being smarter and
2512380	2517180	spending more time. So let's do Rosa Parks. Yeah. Then I, um, but then, so then like, oh,
2517180	2520940	I guess what the first step is going back to like sixth grade where you, you, you have this George
2520940	2526060	Washington cherry tree story, right? Yeah. Rosa Parks was an old black lady who was on a bus
2526060	2531660	and she had a lot of bags and she was very tired and, and the climate of, of, of racial injustice
2531660	2538700	was, was just like, uh, uh, uh, bubbling and a, and a brewing and this innocent, perfectly, uh,
2538700	2544140	unaffiliated like woman who just was represented all of America because she didn't want nothing to
2544140	2549020	do with none of this. Um, she was just tired and she wanted to sit down and from that spark to
2549020	2554220	revolution because, and it's like now I'm realizing like that was the sinister that George Washington
2554220	2559420	cherry tree tree story is propaganda about, Hey, you don't have to be an activist. You should just
2559420	2563820	sit down and shut the fuck up. If you want to cause change, like just do what makes you,
2564620	2570460	but the truth is she was 40. She was later when you're 20, you learn, you, you, you hear these
2570460	2574780	like whispers of these like, Hey, you know that Rosa Parks thing? It's all bullshit. It was
2574780	2579660	orchestrated. There were a million Rosa Parks before Rosa Parks, a million people sat on buses
2579660	2584540	that were, they weren't supposed to. And she, and she was a, she worked for the NAACP. What do you
2584540	2589740	think about that? And it's like, I got, I got whispers of that. I remember at some point I was
2589740	2596220	like, Oh boy, I, you know, then you, then you just read her fucking Wikipedia page, which is not the
2596220	2604940	truth probably. It's Wikipedia, but the truth is it's an amazing story. She worked for the NAACP.
2604940	2619900	Yeah. To Claudette Colvin. Yeah. Claudette Colvin was the, uh, the original Rosa Parks. Yeah. She's
2619900	2624940	15 years old. Yeah. And she, when she was pregnant, so, and she's a little darker skinned. So they
2624940	2629740	were like, we got this Rosa Parks and the wings to sort of fully illustrate your point. There was
2629740	2634140	a pregnant, yes, there was a, yes. And she would not have withstood. Now this is also a thing. It's
2634220	2638380	like, do you want to put that kind of pressure on a, on a, on a young woman that is going to,
2638380	2642220	yeah, you have to go all the way up to the Supreme court. Everyone is going to attack you for the
2642220	2648060	rest of your life. Rosa Parks died. Uh, she, she was like, she was attacked for the rest of her
2648060	2652220	life. She lost her job as a seamstress. Her husband lost his job because he wasn't allowed to talk
2652220	2658780	about his famous wife at work. They had to change States. She died alone in an apartment that was
2658860	2663580	robbed. Like, like, like she was robbed, but then she was moved to a higher, uh,
2663580	2668220	income apartment. Beautiful, beautiful apartments owned by the pizza pizza people.
2669980	2673660	We won't name them because we have a, you'll hear the ads for Domino. So
2674700	2677580	we have to call little seizures, the pizza, pizza people, pizza people,
2680460	2683660	because what happened was she did get robbed. People had sort of forgotten about her. She was
2683660	2689260	in Detroit and then, uh, love lovingly, the community stepped in and said, you can't rob
2689260	2694940	her anymore. And then she was living in, hey, that's Rosa parks. They broke into her house.
2694940	2704860	They took all of her chairs. Uh, come on, come on. So she could never sit down. Is that true?
2704860	2710460	Yeah. It's awful. She can't even sit in her own apartment. Black history month. Now you know the
2710460	2716540	fucking truth. I just got excited because when you said that George Washington thing,
2716540	2720540	I was like, I just experienced that exact same thing as my only point. Well, this gets to your
2720540	2724220	point about, about cynicism, right? Cause this is what our show, this is why our show is not a
2724220	2728620	cynical show because you hear those, that cynical version, like, Oh yeah. Rosa parks. She wasn't the
2728620	2732540	first one. There's this other girl, Claudette Colvin, who they fucked her over cause they,
2732540	2737500	she was pregnant. The first whispers are like, if you knew as much as we knew, you'd hate life
2737500	2742380	and you'd hate everyone and you'd hate Rosa parks. But no, it's the fact is the true story,
2742380	2748700	I believe is always a better story. Um, and the true story is that she was an activist and they
2748700	2752860	were, and they were thinking strategically. And so yeah, they were like, Hey, Claudette Colvin,
2752860	2757820	this happened to her. Uh, you know what? I bet we can find someone who will play better in the press.
2757820	2762380	It was purely strategic. Also Claudette was sort of a bitch. She was really rude and she would not
2762380	2767820	do press. She was like, I don't like sitting down on nothing. So they were like, we gotta swap
2767820	2775820	somebody in. But like that, that goes to show you, that goes to show you how smart and committed
2775820	2782620	those activists were. The NCAA, the NAACP was at that time and, uh, and how good a job they did.
2782620	2787580	And the story about her being a little old lady was more or less created by that movement because
2787660	2791660	it's a good story. You know, like it's, it's not, it's not an evil story. It's like,
2791660	2796940	it's helpful to the movement. Yeah. It's putting a different face on what is the set. Yeah. And
2796940	2800140	that's, and that's press and that's politics and that, and, and you know, there's nothing,
2800140	2804300	nothing wrong with that. But you have a, you have a full, you have a fuller understanding of what
2804300	2807500	the movement actually accomplished. If you understood, no, these were activists who were
2807500	2811580	trying to accomplish something and they went about it in a very smart way and you can too.
2811580	2815020	Right. And so then when you look at those kids, like, I don't know the kids who like wanted to
2815020	2818700	Diane Feinstein this week and like went to her office and like, look how smart that is, you know,
2818700	2823260	to like, Hey, we're children. We're literal children saying hello. We would like the planet
2823260	2828700	to be around when we're here, you know, Diane Feinstein was like, uh, well, then let me drink
2828700	2836380	your blood. We are, we are, uh, we are a pack who has pushed these children into a senator's office.
2836940	2840700	The children can't tell you what school they're from because they're not supposed to be part of,
2840700	2844940	they're not political pawns, but there is a group called the sunrise organization.
2844940	2851180	That hires a bunch of people to, uh, pound their way into democratic senators offices.
2851180	2855100	It's the same move that they did to Pelosi. It's not a bunch of kids. It's not random.
2855100	2858780	It's a, it's an orchestrated event where people have cameras where they set up old
2859580	2865260	female Democrats. That is not a cool tactic at all. Oh, well, that's just interesting.
2865260	2870060	They didn't go to Republicans office. Those kids went to Mitch McConnell's office.
2870460	2873900	They were Mitch McConnell's up. Oh, I don't know. I couldn't tell you the details.
2874940	2880620	Well, we all, you know, it's a scam. We didn't send, first of all, we don't use kids as pawns.
2880620	2884300	That's number one. Number two, they don't, they don't send them. They don't send them into an,
2884300	2888860	uh, a candidate who doesn't have a green plan. She had a green plan right for them. And when they
2888860	2893340	did the same thing to Pelosi, Pelosi handed them a plan. Why weren't those kids given that plan
2893340	2897420	before they walked in? Why weren't those kids hooked up with the knowledge they needed? And
2897420	2902860	how come those adults allowed those kids to yell at an older Senator? That's bullshit.
2902860	2907420	California is the greenest state in the nation. Take your ass to the Kentucky Senator's office,
2907420	2910780	go to Philadelphia, go to, go to Pennsylvania's office. Don't,
2910780	2913820	don't just fuck with the female candidates, the female senators.
2915340	2919740	Yeah, these are, these are, these are two minute, don't make a two minute edited tape.
2919740	2924700	You lost me when you posted a two minute edited tape. The whole tape has her receiving those kids
2924700	2931420	with love. Uh, this brings up something I did. I, I was going to like lead with tonight, which
2931420	2937500	was not, not, which was just this fascinating fact that we've now, here we go, here we go again,
2938220	2947820	two years. Well, actually kind of three years later, I, I remember distinctly the point where
2948620	2955180	the primary season was upon us. And, um, and I remember if you, if you go back, I swear,
2955180	2959740	if you rewind the podcast, you'll listen to me being absolutely silent about politics.
2959740	2966300	And the reason is because it was the whole, it was like Hillary people versus Elizabeth Warren
2966300	2971100	people versus Bernie people versus things. And I was like, I, through pure cowardice,
2971100	2975020	not through nobility, because as you saw later, as soon as the election happened, I was like,
2975020	2980460	what this world's fucked. I gotta say some shit. Um, but I was just sort of like,
2981180	2987740	it's time for the groundhog to go back in his hole. And I mean, what is the, it relates to
2987740	2993420	the backfire effect. This idea that we're, we're, we all know now we're watching this. We're,
2993420	2998140	there's a shit storm coming. It's a shit storm that includes our best friends yelling at each
2998140	3003340	other. Uh, it includes this podcast, possibly getting inflammatory. If there's somebody out
3003340	3009020	here that, that, that, that says something, it's like, I remember, I remember years ago,
3009020	3012540	you know, I remember my friend Heath being up here and going like, well, what about Elizabeth
3012540	3016620	Warren? And just like, I remember other people that I respected and who I wanted to be happy,
3016620	3022620	like fucking basically, how can I describe it other than bullying him? Like, like, like,
3022620	3029980	like shouting him down and like our, this backfire effect means that like, that's why
3029980	3033260	the age old tradition of we don't talk about religion and politics, right? Because those are
3033260	3040700	the, those are the, those are the facts that we're all invested in, which means that every time we
3040700	3047100	hear something other than what we already thought we constrict. I mean, people are already, uh,
3047100	3052540	attaching their identities to specific candidates and specific, you know, like platforms and like,
3053180	3058460	I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing, right? Um, I think that is kind of how it works.
3058460	3062700	Yeah. Yeah. It's all like 80% of the country doesn't, right? Like they're not helping us.
3062700	3067660	And I think we, I think we are kind of doing actual, I think what it is,
3067660	3072540	is it's actual politics. Like that's actual, you know, political action is,
3074860	3080220	sounds more like people are using the words socialist, fascist, authoritarianism.
3080220	3083740	It's like, we're actually doing politics in this country for the first time.
3084700	3089500	Yeah. For the first time in like 50 years. Um, and so people gotta like learn how to do it over
3089500	3093100	again. Cause I remember people, Oh, don't talk about politics at a dinner party. I was like,
3093100	3097820	why not? You just say, I liked the president, the end, you know, like there wasn't much,
3097820	3101820	or I don't like, like it was, I don't know. It was kind of easy during the Bush years too.
3101820	3106780	I don't like it. All right. Moving on, you know, we got a couple of years till the election and now
3106780	3111580	there's like, uh, you know, there's actual shit to be worked out. Yeah. Right. I mean,
3111660	3117420	I didn't recognize them as politics because the morning after the election,
3117420	3122140	it was this thing that was making all the women cry. That wasn't politics to me,
3122140	3127740	which means I'm a misogynist. I was like waking up to that. I'm like, why is that waitress eyes
3127740	3134300	so red? Well, because something horrible happened last night that sent her a signal after like her
3134300	3138220	entire life, but et cetera, et cetera. And it'd be it. And as I gained access to that,
3138220	3143900	it wasn't a political thing to me. It was me realizing I was, I was part of a problem
3143900	3147500	without realizing it, et cetera, et cetera. So for me, it was like a journey of self discovery.
3147500	3153020	And then as, as my self discovery is unfolding, I'm triggering people who are going like Jesus
3153020	3159020	fucking Christ, stop talking about politics. You fucking lump of fat, hairy shit with gross
3159020	3167900	flappy tits. You disgusting soy boy fucking virtue signaling cock beta fucking pedophile fuck.
3168860	3177260	How did they know you were a cuck? Well, you know, it's, it would be cool if we didn't talk about
3177260	3184060	behavior and we just talked about policy. It'd be good if we got back to like, let's just talk
3184060	3190860	policy. Yeah. I mean, on our show, like, you know, we do, I don't want to say our show is,
3190860	3194780	is not political because it is because we talk about issues that can only be resolved through
3194780	3200620	politics. Politics as I'll define it haphazardly right now, being like the process of how we decide
3200620	3204700	what we're going to do, you know, in a, in a country of people who have differing beliefs,
3204700	3208780	right? How do you create a consensus or create like a dominant majority for a particular issue?
3209660	3213900	But we talk about, you know, so we talk about like mass incarceration and, and, you know,
3213900	3220460	criminal justice and climate change and things like that. We don't talk about, you know, we rarely
3220460	3226140	say the name of a political party or like use that sort of like angle that you're going to get on it
3226140	3233180	from the daily show, right? And part of that reason is we're trying to get to people in a more,
3233180	3237900	we're trying to hit people at their best and at their most thoughtful and their most open to new
3237900	3243260	ideas rather than activating that identity based part of them. Is there an operation board game
3243260	3248620	aspect to the, to the backfire effect? You can actually avoid, let's call them trigger, trigger
3248620	3255260	phrases. Yeah, a little bit. You know, yeah, we, we will, we will try to make arguments that we think
3257020	3261900	nobody could disagree with, right? Like, you know, for the most part, for instance,
3261900	3268620	when we're making an argument about, about like that such and such a policy is like discriminatory,
3268620	3274140	you know, everyone, if you present to people the basic premise of like, you know, policy
3274140	3279180	shouldn't be racially discriminatory, right? We can all agree that everyone should be treated the same
3279180	3283580	by the government. Everyone will go, yes, I agree with that. And then we say, okay, here's the case
3283580	3287900	that it's not happening. And then we'll go, okay, that probably shouldn't happen. You know, like,
3288220	3292620	if you engage with them that way, they'll, they'll all agree with that premise. If you start with it,
3292620	3298460	where it's like, this person is, you know, like this party is destroying America. People will get
3298460	3303580	there. We'll get there. It almost seems like we're defining diplomacy a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. It
3303580	3308700	seems like, like, like our country was founded by a bunch of diplomats, people who were like really
3308700	3315980	fond and good at like talking around the topic. Yeah. In such high flown terms that how are you
3316060	3322700	going to argue with this? Yeah. And that maybe that's what good diplomacy is. Every time that
3322700	3329260	every issue tends to get like pulled down into factionalism and they love to attribute catch
3329260	3333820	phrases to it. And those catch phrases are often indistinguishable from perfectly logical words,
3333820	3338540	like up in this cloud. But as soon as they're down there, they're off the table. And so you have to
3338540	3346060	be like this weird person who speaks, like they sound like a fucking thesaurus because
3346060	3350540	that's what we do is kind of like rising above everything and floating and going like,
3350540	3357100	Oh, it's a, it is this belief that a mankind that should prosper should, but you know,
3357100	3360540	it's like, why, why, why aren't they just talking about the Tories that we know what this is about
3361340	3366380	fucking Tories rule. And it's, uh, and if they mentioned tomatoes, because of that tomato riot,
3366620	3370780	I know that's dog whistling. We, we, we try to avoid all that stuff. You know,
3370780	3376460	we did an episode about, about guns, uh, for our season premiere this year. And we, um, uh,
3376460	3379900	in the past, like our first year, I was like, we'll never do an episode about guns because that's
3379900	3383740	like one of the big fault lines of American society. Like, as soon as you do that episode,
3383740	3387820	because how do you ruin guns? Yeah. Well, that was, that's a good question. Um,
3387820	3390620	but you know, as soon as we talk about it, people will be like, as soon as you say, okay,
3390620	3393100	I'm going to do an episode about guns, everyone folds their arms and they say, well, you better
3393100	3397660	say what I want you to say. I'm going to change a channel. If you don't, I'm going to be watching
3397660	3401500	you like a hawk. You better say my side right now, you know? And so after doing the show for
3401500	3406060	a couple of years, I was like, I think we can do it. I think we can at least make an attempt to do
3406060	3412380	an episode that like gets people a little bit off balance. Um, and it hits the issue in a way that
3412380	3417020	destabilizes them that hopefully there'll be a little more open-minded to that. You know, we,
3417020	3421260	we, we try to hit things where everybody misunderstands this about everybody's wrong
3421260	3425100	about this. You know, when you ruined guns, I didn't watch that episode. Do you think when
3425100	3434860	you ruined guns that you, um, uh, was there fixed it? Yes. No, no, no. I think we did it.
3434860	3441740	Was there a, uh, did you kind of ruin it for everybody? Uh, that was, that was our, that was
3441740	3445500	our attempt. I mean, it was really interesting because we really wanted to do an episode that
3445500	3451340	would speak to everybody speak to, I hate saying both sides because I don't actually believe in
3451340	3459820	this dichotomy. Yeah. Just ruin fucking binary ruin the Hegelian dialectic. Um, the, uh, I mean,
3459820	3463340	that's what we're, that is what we were trying to do, you know, because these, these coalitions
3463340	3468300	are based around these catch phrases and these buzzwords that have very narrow sort of cognitive
3468300	3473100	troughs that they're like stuck in, you know? And so we were trying to get people out of that and
3473100	3478060	say, Hey, here's a couple of basic things that we can agree on. And then here's a couple things
3478060	3483100	that everybody is getting wrong. Right. Um, so for, for instance, our, our third act was, was
3483100	3487580	entirely about how guns interact with race in America, which is something that, you know,
3487580	3490940	is very rarely people who are pro gun controller, very rarely having that conversation. People who
3490940	3496460	are pro gun rights are very rarely having that conversation. Um, and, uh, uh, yeah, that was our,
3496460	3503180	that was our approach. Um, and then we, yeah, I mean, it was very difficult to do that without
3503180	3508060	falling into both sides ism, because that's the, you know, that's the shitty version of that.
3508060	3512940	Hey, there's a lot of shit to go around. You know, you're wrong. You're wrong. Here I am in the
3512940	3517420	middle, like standing on top of my bullshit mountain. Right. Um, but, uh, and I think we
3517420	3520780	were, if someone were to come up to me and tell me, Hey, this was both sides, bullshit. I'd be
3520780	3525420	like, okay, we did our best. You know? Um, like, I'm not going to argue with you, but we tried not
3525420	3531580	to do that very hard. I mean, that's a remarkable and chilling like description of the, of the ice
3531580	3538140	we're walking across where it's like, there's a term now for both sides ism. Yeah. Um, but yeah,
3538140	3546060	like I wish there weren't sides and, uh, yeah. Now the term both sides is absolutely attributable
3546060	3550460	to what let's call them new Hitler. I don't know what I, I don't know what to call them bad Hitler,
3550460	3554700	dumb Hitler, but, but literally like came out of his mouth and it's like, you could never say
3554700	3562140	both sides ever again while taking yourself seriously as a, uh, arbiter. Yeah. You, because
3562140	3568460	now, and I, I've actually detected that with the, I started to notice like, I won't talk about
3568460	3573660	freedom of speech anymore because the truth is that millennials have heard enough, uh, have heard
3573660	3581180	that phrase so many times, um, during, um, arguments about why they shouldn't, uh, complain
3581180	3585100	about it or your rights. They're all their other rights. Yeah. Why they shouldn't speak up in
3585100	3590860	defense of themselves. Even though I feel like the day I die, it's, it's either going to be prostate
3590860	3598540	cancer, a heart attack, or I'm being shot specifically about first amendment shit that I
3598540	3604140	won't, I won't talk about it anymore because I sound racist when I say freedom of speech. Yeah.
3604140	3609020	Yeah. Um, because, because the dialectic, the dialogue changes. I don't know what's going on
3609020	3613900	back there. Something happened back there. Uh, blue screen. Uh, Oh God. Oh no. Brandon's it.
3614780	3620300	Um, I mean this segues into, well, Rob wanted to, you wanted you, do you, do you have any random
3620300	3624620	things you want to see if Adam can ruin? Cause he truly has ruined. Okay. Here we go. Here we go.
3624700	3633180	Here we go. Skateboards. Oh shit. I mean, uh, say pass. What is it? I mean, those,
3633180	3638940	I've never seen anyone do a trick. Okay. It's the oldest joke in the book, but they always fall off.
3638940	3642620	They're always like, you see the guy do the flip and then he's like, Oh fuck. And he takes a couple
3642620	3646700	stutter steps. That's the only thing I've ever seen anyone do on a skateboard. Awesome. Apples.
3647580	3654700	Apples. Uh, yeah. Okay. Um, apples are really interesting because, uh, they, uh, if you just
3654700	3660940	like plant an apple seed in the ground, this is weird and true. You get like a random apple,
3660940	3665340	like something about apples mean they don't breed true. They like breeding crazy ways, you know?
3665340	3670460	So you'll get like this, a weird fucking probably inedible apple. Um, and as a result, people for
3670460	3675180	most of the time, Johnny apple seed, he wasn't planting apples to, uh, you know, eating. They
3675180	3680140	were only usable for cider. So he was actually planting booze trees all over America. This is a
3680140	3684220	hundred percent true. It's in Michael Pollan's book, the botany desire. Um, and as a result,
3684220	3687900	what would happen is if you randomly got an edible apple, you'd be like, Holy shit,
3687900	3692780	I'm going to be a billionaire. Cause then you would start grafting the tree and cloning it right off
3692780	3698940	of your original, uh, tree. And so it was sort of like a striking oil, like to find, uh, an apple,
3698940	3705740	like, Oh, I, I, uh, Granny Smith, I got it. Like, you know, um, and, uh, so most apples are, uh,
3705740	3714140	clones. That's what I know about apples. Yeah. I'm literally just repeating things
3714140	3718540	from New Yorker articles. Like that's all that's all that's from Michael Pollan's book, the botany
3718540	3723500	desire. You say in the pilot, you go, by the way, every time I say something, there's a bug up in
3723500	3728860	the corner of the screen. There's, it cites the reference. I did that specifically because I was
3728860	3733500	just a comedian and I was like, why should anybody believe anything I say? I need to let them know
3733500	3738060	it's in a book somewhere. Well, why else would they believe it? I do. And I glance up there when
3738060	3743420	you say something and I go like, God damn it. What? And then I'll see like slate 2011. I'll go like,
3743420	3747500	well, you know, I, I'm sure that person did their research. You know what I mean? Like, but it's,
3747500	3752060	it's a proper kind of like, it makes me feel more comfortable. That's a big theme of your show too,
3752060	3758540	is the idea that peer review and the idea of being wrong builds trust. It's okay to be wrong.
3759260	3764780	Admit you're wrong. It's the corrections page in a newspaper, you know, it's when someone is,
3764780	3770300	we try to be transparent about our process so that people like, one of our, our head of research,
3770300	3776860	Natalie share has a great phrase for this. I can't remember exactly what it was, but it's not the
3776860	3783020	idea that someone is perfect or that, you know, oh, sorry. It's credibility is more important than
3783020	3788060	accuracy, right? Because you're not going to be 100% accurate, but what you can be is as credible
3788060	3792620	as you can. And so you can say about someone, Hey, they do their research. They, uh, they
3792620	3797100	approach these issues in a credible, you know, respectful, uh, you know, top of their intelligence
3797100	3801420	way. When they're wrong, they fess up to it. Like, this is a person who I can trust in a way. Right.
3801420	3806300	And so that's the, that's the ideal that, that we go, that we go for. All you have is your word. So
3806300	3810060	always use my therapist and say, always use your eye statements. If you're talking, you know,
3810060	3814540	if you're talking to somebody about emotional issues, just always, always make sure you're
3814540	3820460	always talking about how you feel that way. Like, well, you know, you could be, you could be a crazy
3820460	3827580	person, but you would be constantly, people could rely on you. You could be like, Dan's always,
3827580	3832620	he's nuts, but I know exactly how he's nuts. Cause he's always like, those windmills make me want to
3832620	3839420	eat more salt. And, um, I am now very upset about my circumcision, by the way.
3840380	3845820	I saw the sex episode and I did not, I wasn't sure what to think about. I guess the one,
3845820	3851100	the one nice thing about it is that if I have a kid, I don't think I'm pretty sure I'm not going
3851100	3855980	to have them circumcised. That's my favorite thing that, uh, people will come up to me and say, and
3855980	3860300	they'll, they'll say, I didn't, they'll say, we didn't circumcise our kid because of you. And I
3860300	3867660	say, yes, if you could change one life, if you, if you could change one, uh, small child's penis in a
3867740	3874540	positive way, if, no, look, I just, I want to say that, uh, circumcision, our position is there's no
3874540	3880380	particular reason to do it, right? It's not a terrible thing to do. And if people do it for
3880380	3884140	religious reasons, that that's fine or whatever. There's no medical reason to do it. And so if
3884140	3889580	you're of the general position that I am, which is don't perform unnecessary surgeries unless you
3889580	3896060	have a really good reason, then, Hey, why not not do it? You know, and like there's certain, you know,
3896060	3901020	uh, uh, yeah, that's about it. But I don't, I don't want to, I went on the business of shaming
3901020	3906220	anybody's dick hygiene thing. But then I thought, I was like, wait a minute. Why would cavemen have
3906940	3912540	a piece of their penis that if left untended gives you an infection that makes no sense.
3912540	3917020	They roll around in dirt. The forest, the forest can serves a, the forest can serves a purpose.
3917020	3923500	It, it, it covers the penis, which is a sensitive area that could get dirty. It's got a time on
3923500	3929820	harm of town in that same episode. I mean, you could have broke these into three episodes,
3929820	3935900	but in that same episode, herpes and hymens, I, I, I was talking about all of them,
3937580	3944060	two H's herpes, herpes. 90% of people have some form of herpes, some form of herpes.
3944060	3949980	Herpes is an extremely, uh, so the problem with herpes is that people, the real scourge of herpes
3949980	3954700	is that people get a herpes test and then they're told they have herpes. And then they're like,
3954700	3960140	oh no, I have a horrible STD and now I can't have sex with normal people. You know, I can't,
3960140	3965660	I'm a pariah and they sort of feel, you know, like, but most people who have herpes, 90% of
3965660	3969820	people have some form of herpes. Um, and then your mouth herpes, like there's that's talking
3969820	3973900	all over the body, right? But like so many people who have herpes don't know that they have it.
3973900	3979340	And that's fine because it never affects their lives at all. Is it because they don't get tested
3979340	3983900	or is it because it's because it's for most people, it's so asymptomatic, you wouldn't know
3983900	3988540	that you had it. And so sometimes I've, I've talked to people who are like, I went to get an STD test
3988540	3994060	and I told the doctor, I wanted a herpes test too. And they said, don't get one because doctors know
3994060	3998220	that you're, you probably have it and finding out that you do have it is just going to make you put
3998220	4002940	a social stigma on yourself. So you're better off because it's a thing that like everybody,
4002940	4007260	everybody has. Now that's not, now, you know, there, there are like, except everybody has it.
4012860	4020220	The jokes are too good to resist despite that. Everybody has. But that, yeah, it's, uh, it's
4020220	4025340	shame. I mean, I love that, that, that, uh, your, your episode on sex, we try to remove shame
4025340	4031580	circumcision to Hyman, to herpes. Yeah. And it comes around to the fourth act of what explains
4031580	4037260	all this stuff, all the things that were wrong about shame, shame surrounding sexuality, little
4037260	4044380	boys are having their, their, their Dick tips cut off at birth based on at best. Now we're not
4044380	4049980	questioning anybody. If you're, if you're getting your Dick tip cut off for a 5,000 year old reason,
4049980	4055180	we're, I'm not saying this podcast is not saying, Hey, storm the gates. I, I, I have no business
4055180	4061980	there. But, um, but truthfully, if you can't, if you're just, uh, it's, it's questionable reasons.
4061980	4067100	We don't, there's no science that suggests it was a fad in the 19th century that, that they thought
4067100	4071820	would stop kids from masturbating. Um, and that's why I took off in the United States, but not in
4071820	4075660	most of the world, right? It was a, I do wonder what my life would be like if I masturbated more
4077660	4081980	and if that would be a bad thing. But I apparently this, this procedure does not stop people from
4081980	4086060	masturbating. I gotta say it. Probably the main thing it's done is it's probably really increased
4086060	4091660	lube sales in America because, uh, the foreskin is a natural lubricant. And, uh, if you don't have,
4091660	4095980	I think you need more lube. It's good because it's a mucus membrane, I assume. Cause you cited,
4095980	4105180	you said that if you're, if you're gay, um, uh, not being circumcised, uh, being circumcised will
4105260	4113500	reduce the HIV, uh, uh, risk, right? But, but not, but we're talking about bareback versus condoms.
4114220	4123500	Condoms reduce it by 80%. He points at me like to continue. Um, I, uh, yeah, there's, there's a
4123500	4129820	small effect that's been shown that being circumcised can re can reduce the risk of
4129820	4136620	STD transmission in, uh, certain cases by some percentage, right? But it's like some small
4136620	4140780	percentage. It's like your chances of transmitting it are like 10% less or something like that. Um,
4140780	4145020	which is to my mind, not a good reason to chop off part of your body. You can wear a condom,
4145020	4148140	right? Or if you can practice safer sex, you don't need a surgical, right? Like nothing,
4148140	4152220	nothing beats a condom in the first place, which is the important, I read an article once that said,
4152220	4160780	if we were to, uh, if we were to circumcise a third of men on earth, we could reduce the cases
4160780	4165900	of a cervical cancer, which is caused by HPV by a couple thousand per year, right? It's like,
4165900	4171500	you're going to circumcise 2 billion people, like billions of people in order to just give out
4171500	4175660	condoms. You know, like it's a better, that's a better, that's a better plan than, Hey, we're
4175660	4179900	going to go around with scalpel still like everywhere in, in the world. Right. Uh, that's
4179900	4186780	my, that's my feeling about it. I just think about my dog. They get, they get, they get that
4186780	4190860	little lipstick comes out and then they go, well, the reason that lipstick isn't always out is
4190860	4195340	because they're not circumcised. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like, so I'm like looking at it. Imagine if
4195340	4199660	we circumcised dogs, it was out all the time. That'd be horrible. Like the dog would be so bummed out.
4201660	4206540	Yeah. But again, again, it's like the, the thing, one of the reasons it's been able to persist
4206540	4212060	is because it's not a particularly bad thing to be circumcised. Right. Um, and so, uh, it's like,
4212060	4216940	fine. It's totally great. And the reason the myth around hymens has persisted is because it blends
4216940	4221740	perfectly in with our kind of like bullying of young girls are saying like, Oh, there's this event
4221740	4225420	that's going to happen when you have sex for the first time. You should think about it more than
4225420	4230300	the guy does. Cause the guy could just stick it in and go away. Yeah. And, uh, you, however,
4230300	4234620	you're the recipient of this thing and we're trusting you with this like drum skin that's
4234620	4240220	kind of like, and then, Oh God, you better not. Yeah. You'll be changed forever. Yeah.
4240220	4244940	It's actually, it's practicality that perpetuates that myth. It's a little more insidious than the
4244940	4248540	circumcision. Yeah. It's incredibly insidious and it's, and it's simply not true. It's just the,
4248540	4252620	the hymen does just, it's just a thing. It's not as nothing to, you know, it's all about,
4252620	4256700	I got the impression it's unrelated to sex that it's just a fucking thing. You know,
4256700	4260700	I don't want to get too outside of my lane, um, uh, talking about it because, you know,
4260700	4263500	we did that episode a couple of years ago and we made our claims there and, you know,
4263500	4269740	I'm not an expert on, on, uh, on female anatomy. I've never seen a woman. Um, but, uh,
4271100	4276460	but yeah, I mean the Hymen is not a barrier that is covering the, you know, vagina. And then the
4276460	4280300	first time a dick comes through, it's like, you know, ruptured forever. Like that doesn't,
4280300	4284380	that's literally what I pictured my entire life was I was like, it's like a freshness seal.
4284380	4289420	It's like a fucking Capri sun. Boom. You go through there. You're never going to close that
4289420	4297180	Capri sun again. That's what I thought it was. And I had sex ed in that paper thing on a football
4297180	4302700	field that the band comes through. But I, but I really love this. This goes back to how much
4302700	4309100	heart the show has on that football field, this character of Emily. Um, uh, uh, Adam is,
4309100	4315180	is standing with Emily's, uh, boyfriend Murph, who's a health teacher, but you guys are, are,
4315260	4321420	are preoccupied with the, uh, the myths surrounding the Hymen, because the first one on the list is
4321420	4326940	the cherry pop and daddy's, uh, and the, and the two of you as men are just like looking at,
4326940	4332940	at a CD case and like arguing about why it's bad, which leaves Emily to like walk away from you guys
4332940	4339100	down the football field in a beautiful haunting shot where she just basically says without
4339100	4345340	preaching that like, this is also, by the way, you can use this myth of the Hymen. There are
4345340	4350940	countries where women have to show proof of Hymen to get a fucking food stamp or whatever it is.
4350940	4354620	They didn't show proof of something that doesn't exist in that form, right? That doesn't even-
4354620	4358780	Food stamp, I riffed. Don't, don't do that. I just say like, like, it's like, if you, you accept
4358780	4363420	something as clinical and cause and effect, it can be used to like really hurt people.
4364060	4368460	If it's a myth, it's crazy. It's like the same thing as IQ tests, which you also ruin,
4368460	4371980	which have been used extensively for racism. Yeah.
4371980	4375980	Anyway. So, uh, but that's, that's just like, like, please watch the show. I mean,
4375980	4381340	it's really, it is not a show that wants you to be unhappy and wants the world to be a worst place.
4381340	4387260	Yeah. I mean, our, our, I always say the ruins part of it is like, it's a superficial joke,
4387260	4389180	you know, it's like- You ruin comfort. I mean,
4390060	4394300	when you learn something that is contrary to what you believe, it's like,
4394300	4397740	unless it's really a backfire effect situation, it's momentarily uncomfortable,
4397740	4402460	you know, you're like, Oh no, that's not, ah, fuck, my gears are grinding. Ah, geez. Right.
4402460	4407260	And then, uh, but then as you learn and you start to embrace the actual truth,
4407260	4411020	it's really fun and rewarding to learn a new thing. And it, because you know that it makes
4411020	4414700	you more powerful, it opens the world up to you. One of the reasons our show does well is because
4414700	4417660	once people learn the things they want to go tell someone else right away,
4417660	4421340	right? Like learning case in point, which is something I knew 20 years ago, but I assumed
4421340	4425260	had changed. But then I saw your episode and I was like, wait, I always knew this.
4425340	4431900	This explains everything. Uh, the, uh, your credit card numbers, they've already been stolen.
4433660	4437580	The fact that it seems like every once in a while, like you're, uh,
4437580	4444380	vulnerable to identity theft is, is, is based on the statistical probability of the gigantic
4444380	4448140	landfill full of everyone's credit card numbers that exists online. Yes.
4448140	4453260	That are, that are sold to among people in huge tranches of like billions of cards.
4453260	4457980	Actually protected by the lack of security about your credit card because it's like a
4457980	4463260	school of fish. Like it's like, what are the odds you're going to get eaten very low.
4463260	4467100	And the credit card companies all or the banks more specifically all have, they're just like,
4467100	4470620	okay, we'll just, since this is the case, we'll just cancel the card and refund the thing when
4470620	4474380	it happens and we'll call you on the phone. And, and, you know, so that's why now it's more
4474380	4478060	annoying, right? Because your, your credit card, what people now have their cards canceled,
4478060	4483180	you know, the fraud protection is too strong. Right. Um, uh, but, uh, yeah, that's,
4483180	4486860	but I always knew that because I remember being a kid and I remember, I don't know if it's illegal
4486860	4493100	for me to say this, but I remember being in that phase of my life, like 16, 17. And like,
4493660	4497500	I remember going to those sites and going like, for real, this is, these are just people's credit
4497500	4502300	card numbers. Yeah. And I would take some and I tried some and I, I got, I did some stuff. I,
4502540	4512620	I, I, I, I, I thought maybe it had changed in 20 years, but as your, as your show makes a point,
4512620	4517580	it's like, no, in the seventies they used to take your, your credit card is just literally a card
4517580	4523100	that has the number on it. And they would literally just go one seven five four. Yeah. And then the
4523100	4527900	thing that changed over 20 years is that now a computer does that. Yeah. But it's, it's no more
4527900	4532940	secure. The only thing it eliminates is like one person overhearing your credit card transaction.
4532940	4538060	We've got like, you know, chip and pin when you're using the register is you're not exposing your
4538060	4542460	number in the same way that you used to be, but the number system still exists, right? All you need
4542460	4545660	is a series, you know, a string of digits, a shorter string of digits and a shorter string of
4545660	4550300	digits. And you can use, you can use someone's card, right? Now, exactly. How would a person say,
4550300	4556540	do that? Maybe you can ruin poverty. You can get online and Google
4558620	4562140	and go like, I want to become a person who trades in the credit card numbers.
4562140	4566140	Basically this would be the equivalent of you becoming a metal detector guy. Yeah. You, you
4566140	4569260	would be like putting the same, you'd be putting so much effort into it. You may as well write a
4569260	4574860	screenplay. Is that what you go down to the beach? You're like, Hey, metal detector guy, write a
4574860	4580380	screenplay. And you're like, Oh, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to
4580380	4586060	do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going
4586140	4589740	to do that Israeli guy. I'm going to write a screenplay. What are you doing? Jesus Christ.
4589740	4595020	Having you seen how easy it is? Saw the Oscars. Oh, did the, uh, by the way,
4595020	4599500	that was a glib dumb reference. I don't know if all the great movies won. Did the,
4599500	4605340	did the favorite win anything? Uh, best actress, Olivia Colby. I love that movie.
4606220	4609340	So good. Any production awards. I thought maybe the guy, I don't think it got,
4609340	4611980	no, I think it only got cause we were worried it was going to be the one
4611980	4616780	best production. It did, it did. Wardrobe, as well. Yeah, wardrobe, yeah.
4616780	4620420	Ludwig Garensson won for this for a scoring Black Panther. He was the
4620420	4627700	community composer. Oh really? Yeah, that movie had a great score for a
4627700	4630820	Marvel movie. He was a Russo Brothers discovery. I can't claim credit for
4630820	4635700	discovering him, but I did, because I was the creator of community, I did have the
4635700	4640300	honor of signing the special letter to the immigration board or whatever you
4640300	4645180	call it, where basically it's like to get a genius visa, which is essentially
4645180	4651460	saying, yes, he's going to take an American's job, but no American can do it.
4651460	4659700	Fuck you, John Williams. Fuck you, Mark Mothersbaugh, you had your chance. Second
4659700	4667420	City, Toronto. Mark Mothersbaugh's doing fine. Both your parents are super smart,
4667420	4672420	right? Yeah, both my parents are PhDs, yeah, PhD scientists. I'm a piece of shit
4672420	4678420	with a BA. Is this where you get the unraveling from? Did they teach you
4678420	4681340	like this? Did they talk to you about these things? You know, I had a lot of, so I
4681340	4686220	mean, I had a really science-filled childhood, but you know, I was also a
4686220	4689900	super ADD kid and I couldn't keep my head on straight, you know, so they
4689900	4693460	wrote me, they didn't write me off, but you know, I was like, they weren't like,
4693460	4698580	this kid's gonna, this kid's gonna make it in academia, but you know, I spent a
4698580	4701620	lot of time watching like kids science shows and things like that, which ended
4701620	4704380	up, I realized only after I created the show, I was like, oh, this show is like
4704380	4707180	Beakman's World. I don't know if you guys remember Beakman's World, but I realized
4707180	4711020	afterwards, I was like, it was really profoundly influenced, like I zip in, we do
4711020	4715060	sound effects for every little thing, you know. Are they impressed? Do you ever call
4715060	4720140	them? Do I ever call Beakman's World? Oh no, that was literally my first thought. Does my
4720140	4726620	father Beakman ever tell me he loves me? Not yet. Yes, my parents are, my
4726620	4730940	parents are impressed. And do they ever get story ideas from them at all? Do they
4730940	4735580	ever give you a good sense on that? You know, I gotta tell you, almost the
4735580	4740140	opposite. We did an episode on science, which is one I'm very proud of, because I
4740140	4743940	love science, it's dear to my heart, and it's about systemic problems in science,
4743940	4749540	with science funding and with, you know, overuse of mouse models, like they
4749540	4753300	use mice for too many things and stuff like that. And I watched it with my dad,
4753300	4759500	who's the an administrator at a PhD and a vice president of the University of
4759500	4763060	Oregon, and I watched it with my sister, who's a PhD in nuclear physics and a
4763060	4766620	journalist at the wonderful magazine Science News, really good outlet if you
4766620	4771220	guys like learn about science, and I watched it with them, and then afterwards
4771220	4776140	they looked at me and they were like, you really simplified a lot of stuff in this,
4776140	4782820	and I was like, no, I don't want to hear it. Don't do, just tell me, good job. I was like sitting there
4782820	4789260	watching them during the episode as they were like, I don't know, yeah, kind of
4789260	4793020	painting with broad, a broad brush, you know, like my dad, who we're talking about
4793020	4797060	problems in science funding and the NSF and, you know, corporate and
4797060	4799900	billionaire funding of science and the problem with that, my dad worked at the
4799900	4803700	NSF and gave grants, and he was like, no, no, no, it's a good system. I was like,
4804020	4808860	here's the thing, when people are so close to something,
4808860	4814220	something I hear a lot is, oh, Adam Ruins Everything is a great show until he does
4814220	4819100	something that you know about, right, and like, yeah, I'm sorry that in six minutes
4819100	4823260	we didn't manage to like meet the standards of your like fucking PhD, right?
4823260	4826380	Damn it, people get so excited, that's one of the biggest problems with the
4826380	4831180	internet, is people get so fucking excited when the ocean of everyone
4831180	4836660	dwelling together accidentally runs over a single goddamn thing about that
4836660	4841380	that's important to them. It's like, yeah, it's that's just be excited about that,
4841380	4844260	don't get mad about it, yeah, damn, you're talking about, you mentioned the
4844260	4851860	pixies, oh fuck, I saw the mass, I saw the mass, they're like, oh my god, I finally, I'm the person here.
4851860	4855220	I mean we did this thing on mouse models, which is that, you know, mice are,
4855220	4859140	mice and rats are overused in medical testing and science and the reason is
4859140	4862500	because the models are very, it's very easy to get the mice, it's cost-effective
4862500	4865540	and it's replicable, you can do it over and over again and it's like easy to get
4865540	4874340	funding to do that, right? There are problems with it. My dad told me about that when my dad's not a scientist, he told me, he said, you know, those
4874340	4879460	rats are bred for cancer. That's the thing that people say. What do you mean?
4879460	4885060	It's like, well, they're, the rats are now easier to give cancer because all they
4885060	4893220	get is cancer. I just remember that from what I was like eight. That's kind of broadly true. I mean, it's like there's such specific
4893220	4899700	populations, right, because they're trying to reduce the number of variables, right, when they're, when they're testing, but as a result, their findings then
4899700	4904220	become like really, really narrow and just, you know, we talked to a fucking cancer
4904220	4907900	scientist who says, hey, we shouldn't be using mice quite this much, right? It's a
4907900	4912220	systemic problem in science and on, you know, Reddit, we got so many people
4912220	4916500	saying, I am a scientist who uses mice and he doesn't know anything about mice
4916500	4920860	and I use mice very well, you know, and the thing is from their vantage point
4920860	4925100	where they are at their particular post-grad program at the University of
4925100	4929820	whatever doing their work, like they have such a specific, their whole lives are
4929820	4934860	their little corner of it, you know, like sort of writ large and I'm talking about,
4934860	4940580	I'm doing an overview for a general population of the field from 10,000 feet
4940580	4943860	up, right, and so like those, even though we're talking about the same thing, our
4943860	4947460	perspectives are so different that like they can't, you know, they can't quite go
4947460	4951100	to, they can't quite go together, you know, and they have that strong reaction.
4951100	4954820	Is there a version of an episode, I'm going back to your parents thing, is there a version of an
4954820	4960340	episode where you ruin the child-parent relationship? Which is to say, I'm both
4960340	4966620	sides, both sides, because sometimes I feel at 46 like I look back on a lifetime
4966620	4975460	of kind of like symbolizing them. Oh, my mom said this, my dad said that, and I
4975460	4978700	just told that story about my dad saying that. It's like I, it's so easy to want
4978700	4983900	them to be wrong and all this stuff, and like it, I guess, I'm fascinated by this
4983900	4989820	concept, like, like, Schwab used to tell me this story. Schwab's gonna grow up to be a,
4989820	4994460	God knows what, he hasn't grown up yet. No, Schwab, Schwab, Schwab grows up to be a
4994460	4999460	comic book artist, right? So Schwab has these stories, like, when we're like 20
4999460	5003540	and we're hanging out, and Schwab remembers being a kid, and your mom hid
5003540	5008620	your comic books, and you know, she wasn't, she didn't have the right. I had a comic book,
5008620	5013180	Ranserox, and it had on the, and it had some racy, it was kind of like a heavy
5013180	5019580	metal kind of a sci-fi book, and there was like some naked nudity in there. Hell
5019580	5028300	yeah. I guess to skip ahead of it, I'm wondering, like, do we, when we, I always,
5028300	5031500	because I also watch these true crime things, and then like people are so
5031500	5036700	fast, and they go like, oh, Ted Bundy, Ted Bundy's parents were like this. I'm
5036700	5047260	like, according to who? Fucking Ted Bundy? Are you comparing me to Ted Bundy? Yes, I am.
5047340	5051340	What the fuck? I think if you had slightly less of a support system,
5053980	5060220	no, what I'm saying is, do we as adults, like, I wonder what field of psychology, like,
5060220	5066620	like, studies, it's like the idea of, like, I picture it like a boat's wake, like, to what
5066620	5071740	extent, I know it's like nature versus nurture is a thing, but I'm saying like, like, people,
5071740	5075820	like, we tend to interview people about their childhoods. We go like, oh, hey, so-and-so,
5075820	5080140	what do you remember about your childhood? Well, my mom was always very encouraging about the
5080140	5085020	alphabet. Oh, really? That's weird because your life ended up being about the fucking alphabet,
5085020	5092060	you alphabet scientist. Like, guess what you erased from your brain, your mom, like, washing
5092060	5096620	your dick too hard in the bathtub. We don't know. Like, how do we know whether washing your dick
5096620	5100060	really hard makes you into the alphabet? Like, we're going to lose that stuff because we have
5100060	5104860	this, like, fixation on this idea of the truth, like, this biographical truth.
5105980	5110300	Why didn't you become a dick washing scientist who studies dick washing?
5110300	5114460	We think that's how it is, but, like, have you touched on any area of that?
5114460	5117740	We haven't done, we haven't done parenting. Have you done that episode?
5119580	5124460	Well, there's a lot there. There's a lot to unpack. There's a lot to unpack. We, you know,
5124460	5128140	we've never done parenting specifically because we've done, we've tracked Emily and Murph throughout
5128140	5131580	the stages of life. So they get engaged and we did an episode about their engagement. We did an
5131580	5135100	episode of Adam Rubin's Weddings. We did an episode about having a baby, right? And then we decided at
5135100	5139580	the end, we sort of had a very soft, you know, our message at the end of that was like, hey, you don't
5139580	5143900	have to have a kid, right? That was sort of trying to take that shame off, that pressure off of people.
5144700	5146940	It's not your chance to make the world a better place.
5147580	5153260	Yeah, to have a kid. Yeah, right. Yeah, I mean, that's, yeah, that's, that's certainly my,
5153340	5158220	my perspective is that like, I don't think there's a moral imperative to have children
5158220	5162460	personally. And, and if people want to have them great, but I don't think it's like a thing that
5162460	5168300	we, we have to do, right? So at the end, we have Emily and Murph decide to wait. And so they don't
5168300	5173980	have kids. And so, but maybe, maybe one day, you know, God willing, if we keep going, we'll,
5173980	5180060	we'll do that episode. But yeah, I don't know. I feel like the, the amount of like the
5180060	5185580	fucking butterfly effect of parenting is so vast that I feel like almost the worst part about it,
5185580	5189980	as a parent, I can't imagine having to live with that because you feel like, oh, everything I do
5189980	5194940	is going to be like that fucking Simpsons episode where like, you know, suddenly, suddenly they,
5194940	5199500	they turn into some kind of weird monster because I do XYZ, but it's completely unpredictable. And
5199500	5203420	you actually have almost no control over it at all. Like all the things that, you know, I talked to
5203420	5207820	my therapist about, about, you know, my, my parents doing XYZ, none of it's none of it's, you know,
5207820	5211900	particularly bad, but the things that did affect me are things that I know that, that they never
5211900	5216060	even thought about or that they, they were just tiny little quirks of their personality that were
5216060	5220940	just, you know, like a little bit too harsh about this or a little bit too loose about that or more
5220940	5224860	importantly. And this is the thing that plagues me is don't you think it's possible that there's
5224860	5230060	moments where they're like, by the way, all that other shit that you're going to remember.
5230940	5237900	Um, that's awful. I'm so sorry. I came off that way earlier today. Adam, you got to remember
5237900	5244220	it's so important that mice, mice are overused in or whatever the thing is, whatever. And that,
5244220	5251340	and that it just didn't serve your, uh, your, your, your adult brain, your developing brains.
5251340	5257420	It's like, you create this like rocket thrust behind you. You go, why am I who I am? And the
5257420	5263740	memories that don't serve that narrative, they just like, like, like, like, like, oh, uh,
5263740	5270940	old man Withers down the street was racist. And that's why I'm not. And I decided that. And so I
5270940	5277660	forgot that old man Withers, uh, uh, saved the space lab from, I'm not going to riff a narrative.
5277660	5282140	That's already halfway into one. I might as well complete it. Uh, he saved space lab
5283100	5288540	with his racism. I don't know. Uh, yeah. Well, that doesn't, that's in that case, old man
5288540	5293500	Withers was still racist. I don't know why I, yeah, there's this, there's this conflict because
5293500	5299660	I, I believe, what did it, what's going on back there? Can't you guys just, is it on a loop or
5299660	5305100	something? What's going on? I believe that every time it happens, everyone feels like they have to
5305100	5312380	react. The weird, I would just put it on like a, like a, a video of a badger robbing or something.
5313900	5319420	Like a fast motion. I'm curious. I'm actually curious what you'll say to this. Cause one of
5319420	5324620	my beliefs, um, and I've read your writing on, on story structure and stuff. And, and, and, uh,
5324620	5329900	I love it. Uh, but one, one of the things that I believe is that, uh, you know, real life is not
5329900	5333580	story shaped, that people's lives are not actually stories. And then, and that that's something that
5333660	5337980	we impose onto them and that the real, and we actually have an upcoming episode. Our season
5337980	5343020	finale is going to be about exactly this problem because on our show we use stories to, in the way
5343020	5348860	that I described to, to give people information. But in reality, uh, the real world is not story
5348860	5353580	shaped, right? Like we tell our, our three beat story about Teddy Roosevelt's life, but Teddy
5353580	5358300	Roosevelt did not have a story like that to his life. That's something I imposed on it. Right. Um,
5358300	5362620	and so the, in, to the extent that we're using those stories, we get, we get further from the
5362620	5367340	truth. And I think we do that for our own lives as well. Um, but at the same time in life and human
5367340	5373420	society, definitely not story shapes because it's slop a doodle because it, but the only things that
5373420	5378860	are story shaped are like the day because the sun comes up and goes down. So you can always rely on
5378860	5387260	that and like the seasons and life and death and the kind of like general nature of how this too
5387260	5393100	shall pass. Like, um, you're mad at this person today. Maybe you're mad at them because you love
5393100	5397900	them. You're going to find that out later. Like those kind of like those things that aren't, uh,
5398620	5403420	um, pollutable by the fact that everyone else is going through them all at the same time.
5404060	5409580	That creates static and that, but the individual signals, I think if you were to the extent that
5409580	5413500	it's possible to have an individual have a relationship with the universe, I think that
5413500	5422860	the story structure holds true. I think the nature and well, okay. But I do, I do know exactly
5422860	5425980	what you're talking about because then what we have to do is function together. And then,
5425980	5430940	so then we go, oh, Teddy Roosevelt, you know, lesson you learn there, don't dig a canal unless
5430940	5437980	you want malaria. And then someone else is like, well, actually. And we're like, you're actually me
5437980	5442220	and my story is about crossing the threshold of learning what actual is. And everyone's right.
5442220	5446700	And everyone's wrong. Cause it's like, yeah, it's like all signals and it just creates static,
5446700	5455580	but your heart is beating every beat a muscle, like go across as it is a four act story.
5455580	5461500	Right. It's a four chambered heart. But I, I, I, uh, my, my, my believe I, I, I agree with that
5461500	5464940	except that I believe that's like a structure. That's a structure that we impose, right? That's
5464940	5467660	a structure. Like I believe the story is the structure of the mind out of the universe,
5467660	5471260	right? If humanity was wiped out, nobody would care. There would be nobody to care about anything.
5471260	5475580	There would be no, you know, sort of like the sun would be revolving, but there'd be no vantage
5475580	5479740	point from which it would rise and set, right? Um, there would, there would be no one to observe it.
5479740	5483980	Yeah, this is absolutely about the experience of being sentient. Yeah. And so that's what I
5483980	5489980	bump into because I'm really, I'm my, what I'm, uh, uh, most interested in is understanding the,
5489980	5495420	the universe as it truly is, right? This is fucking, I'm just getting, gonna nose dive into
5495420	5500380	Kant here. But like, um, I, uh, what I'm really interested in understanding the world as it truly
5500380	5505500	is, and to the extent that I, uh, am imposing my own structure on it, that's an extent to which I
5505500	5511260	don't truly understand it as it is. Uh, and, uh, and it seems like the story is like such a deep,
5511980	5516300	uh, piece of how we think, uh, deep, like characteristic of how we think that we can't
5516300	5522140	escape it even as it distorts, uh, the world that we're trying to observe. Yeah. I mean, jeez.
5524380	5529260	There is that idea that the only, um, footage that is real documentary footage is surveillance
5529260	5534220	footage because those people are unaffected because the camera's not in plain view.
5534860	5537980	But the camera, yeah, I mean, and then, but what about, but what about actually,
5537980	5543180	but like the camera was mounted, uh, in suspicion. It was mounted by Macy's because Macy's didn't want
5543180	5547980	their parking lot robbed. It was a choice made by everything that human sentience touches.
5548780	5555100	It creates a perspective and a flavor. I think if you, there's a way to look at that to, to, to,
5555100	5561340	to defeat yourself and go, Oh, so all I am is a, is a conscious monkey. That's just like projecting
5561340	5566620	an illusion onto a chaotic universe. But can't you just flip that and go, well,
5567420	5572620	flip the telescope, look through the big end and into the monkey and go, um, no,
5572620	5579580	a monkey is tiny. Yes, he is very tiny. And, and, and the universe's point is that monkey for the
5579580	5583660	time being, according to that monkey. And that, and that's what the monkey needs to know to actually
5583660	5587500	understand the universe. Because as far as our monkey's relationship with the universe,
5587500	5591580	the only thing that's going to possibly benefit the monkey is through that telescope, even though
5591580	5597580	it's absolutely a fraudulent telescope, because the monkey understanding what the Milky Way thinks
5597580	5604140	won't help the monkey and the milk and it won't, it, it, it, it's like, uh, yeah, I don't know.
5604140	5610060	I'm scared. I'm scared. You're scaring me. So I'm like panicking and like, you're like flailing and
5610060	5614060	going like, look, listen, Adam, all we have to do is make good television and then die.
5617020	5619660	I agree. I agree with that. I agree with that statement as well.
5619660	5623180	I accept that buying a Tesla didn't help the earth, uh, as much quarter as I give you.
5625260	5629980	I mean, I, I agree with that last statement. All you have to do is make good television and die.
5629980	5633660	I mean, when I make my show, I'm like trying, that's me trying to work that out, you know,
5633660	5638940	like, well, our, our season finale this year is literally us like grappling with those
5638940	5643260	issues. Right. And the issues of like, is the structure of our show make our show less true?
5643260	5648060	Oh man. Yeah. That's, I mean, this is my new favorite show. I'm going to like watch it because
5648060	5653260	it's, that's, it's fucking meta in the best way. Thank you. Um, you should, you should ruin the
5653260	5658860	word meta. It's a, it's a Greek prefix. It means nothing. It means beyond, uh, the, it, it shores
5658860	5664140	up the fourth wall. It makes you identify with characters, uh, uh, do, do all kinds of stuff
5664140	5668140	like that. You also have an offshoot. That's like an animated thing where you just investigate history.
5668140	5673100	We did a, we did animated episodes. Yeah. Uh, that were called reanimated history and they were,
5673100	5678940	and they were specifically, uh, it was the, the network wanted, uh, more episodes in less time.
5678940	5682940	And they were like, you're like, and they're like, you shoot all year. What if we do animated
5682940	5689100	episodes? And I said, uh, maybe. And they said, great. Yes. And then we did them. And, uh, they
5689100	5695980	came out quite well. Um, but, uh, yeah, there, uh, uh, it was like, we ended up creating an
5695980	5701580	entirely different format for them, uh, where it's me interacting, uh, uh, with a narrator.
5701580	5704700	Um, I heard Chris Parnell's voice. He is. Chris Parnell is the voice of it,
5704700	5708220	which was incredible to, to have him. If you, if you're going through Rick and
5708220	5714460	Morty withdrawals, you can, you can listen to Jerry narrate history, animated Adam ruins it for him.
5714460	5718220	Yeah. I really recommend this show. Like it's kind of, it's one of those things where it's like
5718220	5723820	easy to recommend because I just watched 10 minutes of it. You're gonna, it's like a grape
5723820	5726620	or a crack rock. Like you're, you're, you're in or you're out.
5729100	5731900	You will sell all of your shit and lose your teeth over this show.
5733580	5740140	Oh man. Grapes. Grapes will get you. That's what, that's what, that's what grapes do to me. Oh man.
5741340	5745740	Well, I think this is my most important question. It was sort of like hinted at in the beginning
5745740	5752220	and I purposely avoided it, but like, so do you believe in humanity? Do you think we have a chance?
5753900	5757740	And we've only got two minutes. In the broadest, in the broadest sense,
5758540	5765820	in the broadest sense, um, uh, in the broadest, in the broadest sense.
5765820	5772140	Well, what do you think my job is here? I gotta ask that. You know, I gotta ask that.
5772140	5775100	I gotta sleep tonight. What are you, what are you doing?
5775100	5778620	Well, so he's flattering you. He's saying whatever you say is going to affect him.
5779180	5785260	But, well, let me, let me, so a thought I have sometimes is that, let's see if I can do a
5785260	5789660	pessimist and an optimist version. Uh, the, a thought that I have sometimes is that the,
5790220	5796780	the, the amount of time that we have been on earth in our current form, right? Like the,
5796780	5803820	the modern world, right? Is, is so short, right? Our population has gone up by, I don't know,
5804700	5809340	I forget when the earth had a hundred, had one billion people on it as opposed to seven,
5809340	5816460	but it was less than 200 years ago, right? Um, and so the amount of explosion is massive. And if you
5816460	5823100	saw any population of any creature expand that much in that short of a time, you'd be like,
5823100	5829100	this might not end well, right? Like giraffes going from one billion to seven billion giraffes.
5829100	5833340	Yeah, exactly. Fuck it up at four billion giraffes. Easy. And exactly. They'd be like,
5833740	5839020	I invented a new kind of tree. That's artificially tall because you got to justify the neck.
5841020	5844940	Sorry, I didn't mean to derail you. No, no, no, no, that's exactly my, that's exactly my example.
5844940	5849500	I'm not stricken by that. It just feels like it's almost like where the path where complete
5849500	5854540	absolute cynicism and optimism meet where it's like, there's eight billion of us. We're horrible
5854540	5859500	people. Like, like, like when those lights went out in New York, like decades ago, it was like,
5859500	5863500	everybody was like, Oh, there she goes. There goes New York. And then the lights came on the next
5863500	5868860	morning. They're like, we ate all the ice cream before it melted. I was in New York during a
5868860	5874860	blackout and it was, it was kind of nice. I like, like, like, so few, like, we're not,
5874860	5880060	we're not as bad as, but at the, at the same time, at the same time. Okay. So that's like the worst,
5880060	5884940	that's like the worst vision of humanity. Right. And, and in that vision, we're like, um, we're
5884940	5889900	almost like a bacterial infection that found too much like substrate that would allow it to grow.
5889900	5894220	Right. Like we're growing at this rapid pace in this unsustainable way and the crash is a coming.
5894220	5900220	Right. And that's how I feel sometimes. Then I feel other times that, um, I think the, uh,
5900220	5906540	the humanist worldview, uh, doesn't get enough credit sometimes, uh, for how beautiful it is
5906540	5911900	because, uh, uh, I feel like atheists who people want to call themselves atheists don't, don't give
5911900	5918060	this view often enough. Um, uh, because, uh, you know, we, if, if you, if you're looking at the
5918060	5921900	world in those terms, right, that we live in a natural world where, you know, things are,
5921900	5925660	happen because of chemical reactions and that life is essentially a complex chemical reaction,
5925660	5931740	right? Humanity is a chemical reaction that's so complex that not only it, it actually, uh, uh,
5931740	5936860	escaped the bounds of biological evolution and began a process of cultural evolution where, um,
5936860	5939740	you know, the, the rate at which we're growing and the rate at which we're changing the amount,
5939740	5944380	the rate at which our species has changed is orders of magnitude faster than any species that
5944380	5947660	has ever changed before. Right. Because we've created this process of cultural evolution where
5947660	5952220	things are happening in our minds and through language, mimetic evolution has taken over.
5952220	5957020	Yeah. That is like incredibly rapid. And that's something that to our knowledge has never happened
5957020	5963740	anywhere in, you know, ever. Right. Uh, and that makes us the most like, undoubtedly the
5963740	5969020	most remarkable thing to ever happen in the entire universe. Certainly as far as we've seen. Yeah.
5969580	5974140	I mean, like it's, it's, um, it's unbelievable that, and, and it, again, it's just, it's just
5974140	5977900	chemical reactions, like building upon each other, complexity, creating more complexity,
5977900	5983100	creating more complexity, creating more complexity. Um, and so that is the mere fact of our existence
5983100	5990700	is the most beautiful truth in the natural world. Um, and as a result, it kind of maybe, I mean,
5991740	5994700	I was going to say, it doesn't matter what we do. It does because we still need to behave
5994700	5998540	ethically towards each other and try to improve the world that we're in. But, um, the fact of our
5998540	6006380	existence is so, uh, uh, marvelous that it's, uh, uh, difficult to even comprehend. That's my positive
6006380	6015660	view. Yeah. I, I just spoke to Elon Musk about this. You're welcome. Uh, we were just having
6015660	6021340	the same conversation and he touched on this thing that I was like, like, like a Canadian cartoonist,
6021340	6025900	my friend Steven Notley, who can you hear on the podcast? He introduced to me a million years ago,
6025900	6034620	which was this idea of information as a field, IE an organism in its own right. Um, although it
6034620	6039580	doesn't meet our definitions of living, but it does meet our definitions of like wants to be,
6040380	6048780	and that information as a field, uh, it, it goes, it's like, if you look at just us as a sort of
6049500	6056540	Patsy, I guess you'd call it that, that molecular, uh, you know, molecular bumpage leads to
6056540	6062380	cosmic RNA leads to life leads to competition between giraffes and beavers leads to us having
6062380	6066380	eyebrows and having podcasts. And the, but the whole point of it is that we invented hard drives
6066380	6073340	because we've got our cells are bursting with information. The reason we have these chromosomes
6073340	6077660	are just like so tightly wound. It's like comical. It's like, how can you have information that way?
6077660	6083500	And the answer is we barely can when, when, whenever you fuck and like the, the, the,
6083500	6088540	this shuffle has to happen. The ballet of information, having to unwind and then rewind
6088540	6092860	in your baby's cells. It's like, it's gotten to a point where it's like enough is enough
6092860	6098380	coincidentally right at the time when we're also smart enough to make new ways for information
6099100	6104940	to, to, to go on. And my big fear was always, and look, I'm,
6106780	6109100	I'm just going to say Elon shared it.
6110540	6120060	So he made your, he made your solar panels in your cars and like, you know, but I like,
6120060	6125420	I was like, I said, well, we're just like these, like what we're experiencing right now could be
6125420	6131260	intersected with like the kind of, it's, it's like, like, we could be coming to a point where
6132220	6137180	everyone who's an atheist and everyone who's like a fundamentalist could actually both agree that
6138140	6144380	it's over, but the, the, the, the atheists are, are agreeing because it's like, well,
6144380	6152780	our species was never anything more than basically like a, a boot drive, like a, like a, like a weird
6152780	6160460	kind of like intermediary, like, Oh, I, what do I got to work with? Uh, so you, I was like,
6160460	6165420	like the time bandit to get the assistant to the guy that's like, like trying to devise a universe
6165420	6170700	and like, uh, you have a hydrogen, you have, you know, you have these like certain amount of atoms
6170700	6175820	like, all right, well, uh, arrange them in a way that makes them when they bump into each other,
6175820	6180220	want to make more of the things that bumped into each other. And it's like, like, and then just give
6180220	6186140	it a trillion gazillion gazillion years until it gets to a point where, okay, finally we got like
6186940	6190140	plants and furry things like crawling around and they all want to like,
6191260	6195980	now they've got the agenda driven. It's like, it's on autopilot. So if you're a god at this
6195980	6201020	point, you, you've walked away a long time ago, but you're growing basil in your flower box and
6201020	6205500	that's like going, but it's like, like, like, like, because all it's doing is just going like, look,
6205500	6210220	I got one, every, every living thing is just going, I got to beat every other living thing.
6210220	6210540	Uh-huh.
6210540	6220620	I got to fuck more. I got a, but all of it is like bent towards this apex where you and I are like,
6220620	6227180	oh, I need to know how to make eyeglasses and this microchip and this thing and this alphabet.
6228300	6234060	And that we have gotten finally right to the point where what we're experiencing
6234620	6242060	is an actual spiritual abandonment of our original quest. Sorry.
6242060	6243100	You haven't said this.
6243660	6247660	No, no, no, he didn't. I don't, I don't want to throw him under the bus because I know this is
6247660	6251820	me projecting out of shit. I don't want to, I don't want, I don't want to miss credit anybody.
6253980	6262620	What my fear is that we are as primates, we are at the event horizon of, of biologically going,
6263340	6268940	okay, what's next? And, but the information is going like, nothing's next for you.
6268940	6276300	You fucking foot, man. You fucking sky cap. Peace. Here's your five bucks. It's, it's a,
6276300	6280220	actually a coupon from where we're going. Like, you can't even spend it. And we're like, whoa.
6282540	6290460	That, that, that is violence. That is nihilism. Like, like that, that we're, we, that we have a,
6290540	6297500	we're at a crossroads where we could actually, my theory is if we could actually just recalibrate
6297500	6302300	for a second and realize that we are direct descendants of chimpanzees and that by their
6302300	6311660	standards, we are gods and just stop. Like, could we have a conversation with a chimpanzee tonight
6312460	6317260	and they would go, what's wrong? And we would go, well, we got a lot to do.
6318220	6324140	Whoa. Slow down, Jack. I can't even talk. How many spotted leopards are hunting you?
6324140	6328540	And we'd be like, well, spotted leopard of nuclear annihilation. It's like, whoa,
6328540	6332780	Hey, you made that up. Don't, and the, the, the, eventually the conversation would end with the
6332780	6340620	chimpanzee going, you're crazy. I'm going to go have an orgy because I learned to fuck and I'm
6340620	6346780	going to go extinct because of you, not because of me, not because fucking is wrong and not because
6346780	6352460	grooming's wrong and not because, and then we could just realize like we, we, we've eliminated
6352460	6357820	the spotted leopard. Yeah. The wolves are fetching our slippers. We control the weather.
6358860	6364060	Um, if it rains, we don't have to give a shit. We don't control the weather. We could, well,
6364060	6371340	we affect it. We affect the weather. We do not control it. But according to a chimpanzee,
6371340	6376540	yeah. We do because a chimpanzee can't just go indoors. We invented indoors.
6376540	6382060	We do control chimpanzees definition of weather. We can change it from raining to not raining by
6382060	6386300	stepping to the left three feet. Chimpanzees could only do that to a certain degree.
6387660	6391820	What I'd say to that is they always bragging about how you better than chimpanzees.
6391820	6396620	I think it's time. I think, I think we've come here. I think it's, that's going to be my movement.
6396620	6401820	Just compare yourself to a chimpanzee. You're rich. You're happy.
6402780	6407580	What I, what I'd, uh, what I'd say to that and what I'd say to Elon Musk, if he was, uh, uh,
6407580	6413660	sitting here, um, is, uh, there's, there's like this concern. There's like this concern that we
6413660	6419660	are, uh, that the bad thing is something we're going to do, you know, like we're worried about,
6419660	6423580	uh, you know, we're worried about building AI or worried about like building the next level or,
6423580	6427820	you know what I mean? Um, and I'm concerned about the things that we're doing right now,
6427820	6433660	right? Um, that like we're, uh, you know, we're actively, we're destabilizing like
6433660	6439500	weather systems and climate systems right now, you know, and that, uh, we're, we're currently
6439500	6443260	building, you know, a lot of people are like afraid like, Oh, the AI is going to take over,
6443260	6446700	you know? Um, and it's like going to come to consciousness. It's going to Skynet us,
6446700	6451500	you know? Um, but the, the, there's this writer, James Bridal, who wrote a book called New Dark
6451500	6457020	Age. And it's all about how we're building these systems that, uh, they're not AI. They're not like
6457020	6460940	hard AI. That's like, you know, trying to kill us or whatever. They're just systems that we've
6460940	6465420	built that we don't understand, right? Um, that like the YouTube algorithm, like the YouTube,
6465420	6470780	YouTube algorithm is currently giving people, uh, you know, misinformation, uh, conspiracy theories,
6470780	6475340	uh, hateful shit, right? That's what's like being bred on YouTube and nobody knows why, right?
6475340	6478220	Because we don't understand the YouTube algorithm and the YouTube people were just trying to get
6478220	6482300	people to click more, right? That's all, that's, that's all that they were doing. Right. Um,
6482300	6487580	and so like that is the current, you know, that's the problem of technology that, that, you know,
6487580	6491900	I would wish we were focusing on rather than the, rather than the Skynet problem. You know what I
6491900	6499100	mean? Um, like we have so much that, uh, we are like fucking up currently on a daily basis just
6499100	6502940	in how we treat each other on a basic level. I guess if I were a doomsday person, I would say
6503580	6509260	in argument, but your point is better. But I, but I, if I was arguing, I would say, well, no,
6509260	6513660	that's the point of worrying about the future is that you, you do backwards math to what you need
6513660	6518940	to do today. So you go, these computers going to take our jobs. And then you now, you know, today,
6518940	6523180	you need to take a ball peen hammer and you just smash a computer. Like, at least that's something
6523180	6529900	to do. And I, I'm kind of advocating for the chimpanzee model. Cause I'm like, today we could
6529900	6535740	just look at a chimp before they're extinct and go, what do you think? And their unspoken answer
6535740	6542220	would be, you guys are nailing it. You have nailed it. You need to stop nailing. Stop making
6542220	6549820	more sure. I understand, um, the alarm instinct has made you guys like, like very successful,
6549820	6555020	but you are alarmed by each other now, which makes no sense. You're alarmed by nothing. Yeah.
6555020	6561260	You're alarmed by silence. You're alarmed by happiness. Yeah. You're uh, uh, and the, the,
6562060	6567180	uh, yeah. But anyways, um, I, uh, how do we end the show? We do it like this. We say, uh,
6567180	6573580	one of the greatest gifts that we got left us, uh, this past weekend. And it is incredibly sad
6573580	6578300	for all of us, but, uh, incredibly happy that we got a chance to know him. And if you got a chance
6578300	6584780	to see him, uh, you, you would have seen why we all loved him so much. His name is Brody and, uh,
6584780	6590620	he did warm up for community as well for you. But for the most of us in this city, he was,
6590620	6595820	you, you go to a Chinese restaurant and you, you see the buffet of pork and delicious settings
6595820	6599340	out front, but you look over the table and you see the family and they're eating something that
6599340	6605100	is good for them and delicious and has no salt. And that was fucking Brody to comedians. He was
6605100	6609100	that special dish that you only made in the kitchen for you and your family. And you sat
6609100	6613820	around and you enjoyed, and everybody else got this incredible product. But what we got in LA
6613820	6618060	is Brody. So if you got a chance to see him, you know what I'm talking about. If you didn't,
6618140	6625900	please just look up Brody Stevens, um, yeah, he's just, uh, check out his work and we,
6625900	6629340	we will miss him forever. Uh, he was one of the best that ever did it here here.
6632380	6638540	Yeah. Losing too many people. Yeah. It's been a really bad, it's been a really bad couple of
6638540	6643180	months. Yeah. I mean, I saw, I saw an episode called Adam ruins death and I didn't know,
6643180	6648140	I was like, well, if he ruins death, am I, how is that going to work? And I didn't click on it.
6648140	6652940	But, uh, yeah, that, that, that episode's about the, uh, the stark inevitability of death.
6653980	6660060	All right. Yeah. Yeah. Don't need it. But yeah, I mean, not, not this weekend, but you know,
6660060	6664140	another one may be, uh, shrab, you got anything to plug? Don't you have a book coming out?
6664860	6669580	No, about being a fucking piece of shit. Are you fucking talking about
6669580	6675740	without a book? Do I have a book coming out called? I don't have a book. You fucking bookless fuck.
6677180	6681100	This guy's fucking bookless. How'd that chair worker for you?
6682140	6686060	Comfortable. You like it? I like it a lot. I think the best thing on stage.
6687260	6692140	Hey Rob, can I pay you a specific compliment? Because, because you're, I used to watch your
6692140	6696780	work on channel one on one so much. And that influenced so much of our shows and my works,
6696860	6701740	visual style and like the, the visual effects and the, and the special effects you did.
6701740	6705420	And the idea that, Hey, you can do any effect with, you sell it with, you know,
6705420	6709500	no matter with cardboard and like after effects. You know what I mean? I was the after effects
6709500	6714780	guy in my college sketch group. Um, and so I just want to say that like Twiggers holiday.
6714780	6720060	I watched that over and over and over again. Doesn't ruin everything at all.
6720060	6724460	Say you could, you could watch episodes. I could find episodes, Adam ruins everything
6724460	6727580	where I'm like, Oh yeah, that's probably something that I stole from shrub years ago.
6727580	6731740	So Adam, thank you, Adam, before you go, maybe we'll end on this super up note. What,
6731740	6736460	what charity did you like that you've ran across shooting? What, Oh, that's,
6736460	6739420	Oh, what a wonderful question to have. Cause we have a running charity thing.
6739420	6743180	That's right. We have a little bit of time to plug a charity real quick.
6743180	6752300	Yeah. Um, uh, we, uh, there are a couple things, Oh man. Okay. So, uh, we, uh, had for our first
6752380	6756860	year, we had this incredible dude, Chris Faber can't come on. He's the head lawyer for the,
6756860	6761660	or head of litigation for the, for the innocence project. This guy flies around the country,
6761660	6766300	getting people off a death row. Um, and I'm proud to, you know, I'm sort of working with them a
6766300	6769500	little bit. I'm an ambassador, which means sometimes they email me and ask me to tweet
6769500	6775500	something. And I always do, um, uh, they're incredible. Um, and they're really working to
6775500	6780940	actively do, you know, strategic litigate civil rights litigation to, to change the
6780940	6784220	criminal justice system. They get people off death row, which is, yeah, they get people off
6784220	6787020	a death row and they're trying to change. They're trying to set precedents. They're trying to do
6787020	6792620	third, good Marshall shit, you know? Um, uh, and then, uh, for homelessness, which is a really,
6792620	6797340	uh, uh, such a huge issue in LA, uh, there are these incredible organizations that are housing
6797340	6802300	first homeless, uh, uh, organizations that just try to get people in homes directly.
6802300	6807020	There's an amazing one called housing works, California, California, California is amazing.
6807020	6810540	Not housing works, period. Housing works. It's housing works California. You have to know
6810540	6816300	specifically because we know how it works. Uh, yeah, as it does work. Uh, and they, they put
6816300	6821660	people, they, they go find the folks who are most in danger of dying on the street and they put them
6821660	6826140	in a permanent supportive home. I've been to the facilities that they've, that they have, they're
6826140	6829420	just wonderful apartments that people living in them, you know, when you meet them, you're like,
6829420	6832780	this is someone who would have died on the street. Now they're living somewhere safe and warm.
6833260	6835820	Well, what's the name of that one? I'm sorry. Housing works, California.
6835820	6839900	And so that's a direct donation thing where it's like your money turns into money that like
6839900	6846300	results in that. Uh, no, that's no, this is a, uh, uh, no. Well, I would love to turn money
6846300	6848700	into money. How's that? What is that? No, no, no, no, not turning into money.
6848700	6854940	Like it's multiplying. Like I'm rich. I help homeless people. No, the, the, the, the, you,
6854940	6860860	the phrase that in you from your giving episode, we're, we're Adam ruined giving like you, uh,
6860860	6866700	as far as like you're, you're talking about a charity that, uh, you, you give them money and
6866700	6871340	they can do the most with that money. Yes. If you, yes, I'm sorry. Yeah. If you give a charity money,
6871340	6874860	uh, that's better than donating in kind goods, like canned goods and things like that, because the
6874860	6879820	charity is able to use the kind of, so what's the name of the one that in Los Angeles, like pulls
6879820	6884220	the people that are about to die off the street and that is, that is housing works, California.
6884220	6888380	Housing works. Okay. Uh, and they're there. They do really amazing work. And the most important
6888380	6891980	thing you can do if you care about that kind of thing is go to your local neighborhood council
6891980	6896620	meetings. And when someone proposes building a shelter, say, yes, please. And then yell at
6896620	6901820	the people who are arguing against it. Um, that's where they really need support. Um, so, uh, but
6901820	6908460	also, uh, they will get someone off the streets. I asked them, they said for every $5,000 donated,
6908460	6911740	which is a lot, but they can put, take someone, that's how much it costs them to take someone
6911740	6916140	off the street and put them in a permanent home. So if you want to put a dollar, you know, if you
6916140	6920220	can donate a hundred bucks and say, Hey, I got them a 50th of the way there or whatever. For how
6920220	6925740	long? It was a $5,000 like a night. No, no, no, no. That's for, that's for until what you charge.
6925740	6931340	That's for the rest of their lives. That's how much to get them in a home. They can say an
6931340	6936460	indefinitely. Really? Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Jesus. I mean, some dinners, depending on whose
6936460	6943900	birthday it is, some dinners can cost $5,000. Yeah. That's true. In the last 20 years,
6944860	6949340	I can tell some stories. All right. We'll have to save those for the next tarmen time.
6951100	6957900	Thank you so much. Adam Conover. Thank you folks. Dan Harmon, Rob Shroff, Chris Bora,
6957900	6963500	Zach McKeever, Sarah Hill, Nolan Farikas, the lovely dynasty theater. But most of all,
6963500	6971740	to all of you for showing up, we miss you, Jeff Davis. We miss you, Spencer Crittenden. Good night.
6973900	6994140	Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
