0	4800	What's the matter with your life? Why you gotta mess with mine?
4800	8800	Don't keep sweatin' what I do, cuz I'm gonna be just fine.
8800	11800	Check it out if I wanna take a guy.
11800	14800	Good evening!
14800	18600	Harmontown is now in session.
18600	22300	Tonight it is my 40th birthday.
22300	27600	Join me in welcoming to the stage my old dear friend,
27600	31600	the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!
35600	37600	Hey you.
37600	41600	Guest Comptroller, Aaron McGathey, is Jeff Davis tonight?
41600	43600	Haha!
43600	45600	Hello.
45600	50600	This Jeff Davis costume involves so much more than necessary.
50600	55600	It seems like there's a widow's peak you drew with a magic marker.
55600	57600	He's Eddie Munster?
57600	61600	And you seem to have like bronzer all over your face.
61600	63600	I do have bronzer all over my face.
63600	65600	Here's the thing.
65600	67600	I'll address the widow's peak.
67600	71600	I made a very elaborate cake of Jeff's face today.
71600	74600	I carved his face out of Rice Krispie treats and covered it with fondant.
74600	78600	And I discovered that he has a widow's peak, cuz I was staring at pictures of him all day.
78600	83600	By the way, have you seen widow's peak with Julia Roberts and Kenneth Branagh?
83600	85600	Yeah, the wedding.
85600	89600	It's weird to have aliens in the movie.
89600	91600	Why the last 10 minutes?
91600	93600	Oh, is that an actual movie?
93600	95600	It's so good.
95600	97600	Yeah, widow's peak. Kenneth Branagh.
97600	101600	It's like a horror romantic cavity.
101600	106600	Yeah, the poster is just a mountain and then two eyes above it.
106600	112600	But then down at the bottom it's a shot of Kenneth Branagh and Julia Roberts kind of running.
112600	115600	Loneliness is deadliness.
115600	116600	Yeah.
116600	117600	Widow's peak.
117600	123600	Love is never receding.
123600	125600	I mean, it's not supposed to be a receding hairline.
125600	127600	Like he has a widow's peak, which is legitimate.
127600	129600	Clap your hands if you have a widow's peak.
129600	130600	It's a specific thing.
130600	131600	You do, sir.
131600	132600	Clap your hands.
132600	134600	You two, clap your hands.
134600	140600	Widow's peak is in, I remember in science, in seventh grade science, we talked about widow's peak.
140600	143600	Widow's peak being a recessive gene.
143600	149600	Anyway, the reason why I'm wearing bronzer is because I put this costume, I know this is shocking,
149600	154600	I put this costume together very quickly.
154600	162600	And when I put it on, with this black hair, I just reminded myself of me as like a fat 17-year-old
162600	167600	with black hair and I put this on just so I didn't look like that anymore.
167600	170600	You just started rubbing dirt on your face to escape.
170600	175600	I mean, it's supposed to be contours, but really, I was like, oh, Jesus, no, what's going on?
175600	176600	All right.
176600	178600	Well, it's a very special show because it's Jeff's birthday.
178600	179600	It is Jeff's birthday.
179600	183600	He's not here, so he wants, you know, he's celebrating his birthday elsewhere.
183600	185600	But we're going to...
185600	186600	Celebrate Jeff.
186600	192600	We're going to give him the gift slash passive aggressive taunt of having a great show for his birthday.
192600	196600	Back by popular demand, I want to bring him up right away.
196600	199600	Mr. Rob Schwab.
209600	210600	Popular?
210600	211600	Yeah, man.
211600	213600	Yeah, people on the Reddit, they...
213600	214600	Popular demand?
214600	215600	They liked you.
215600	217600	What did they say?
217600	220600	They like our timing together.
220600	223600	You know, we've known each other a long time.
223600	224600	Right.
224600	225600	Say that again.
225600	226600	Say that again.
226600	227600	What did they...
227600	228600	What did they like about her?
228600	229600	They like our timing.
229600	230600	Timing?
230600	231600	Did they like the...
231600	237600	It seems like the audience is in a really good mood tonight, and I think I know why.
237600	239600	We'll fix that real quick.
239600	244600	They got to stay home and watch Breaking Bad, and they got to miss two hours of me.
244600	247600	Apparently, just suggesting pedophiles are great people.
247600	249600	I haven't listened to it.
249600	251600	They're definitely nice.
251600	253600	In true fashion, I kind of...
253600	256600	I always make about 85% of my point, and then I just...
256600	257600	Have some Pepsi.
259600	266600	I actually saw it on the Harmaton subreddit, and this is a really fascinating, weird thing.
266600	268600	There was an actual...
268600	269600	I kind of haven't been going near it.
269600	271600	I've been so busy, and I...
271600	273600	You haven't been going near what?
273600	276600	The illegal...
276600	277600	The Harmaton subreddit.
277600	279600	Oh, okay.
279600	281600	Because I didn't want to read a bunch of people saying, like,
281600	282600	what's your point?
282600	285600	Do you love pedophiles?
285600	291600	But I did notice, skimming, that there was actually a self-identified pedophile
291600	295600	that actually came forward, albeit anonymously, and said,
295600	299600	you know, I don't have any control over what I am and stuff like that.
299600	300600	I just...
300600	301600	Aww.
304600	308600	I'm not making any judgment one way or the other.
308600	312600	However, I would say that my point that I was trying to make is that when we get...
312600	313600	Yeah.
313600	314600	It's...
314600	315600	Oh, God.
315600	316600	Fuck it.
316600	317600	Whatever.
317600	318600	Let's just talk about...
318600	321600	This is an inappropriate question, but did that guy have a sense of humor about himself,
321600	323600	and if so, what was his handle?
326600	327600	Yeah.
327600	328600	Was it...
328600	329600	Was it adamantium?
329600	330600	What was it?
330600	331600	I mean, did it...
331600	332600	I don't remember.
332600	333600	Yeah.
333600	335600	I threw a now and then...
335600	336600	Sorry to jump...
336600	337600	Go ahead.
337600	338600	I'm sorry.
338600	339600	I didn't have anything anyway.
339600	340600	It was really fast.
340600	341600	I threw a now and then...
341600	342600	Your cake was great, by the way.
342600	343600	Thank you.
343600	346600	I threw a now and then party a few weeks ago for some girlfriends,
346600	348600	and now and then was a movie that came out in 1995.
348600	349600	Yeah.
349600	350600	Woo!
350600	355600	And so, in the spirit of that, I printed up a bunch of posters of heartthrobs from 1995
355600	359600	from when I was that old, which I guess 11, when I was 11.
359600	362600	And I felt like I printed them all out and didn't think about anything
362600	366600	until I was taping up a picture of like an eight-year-old Devensawa
366600	369600	and overalls around the house.
369600	373600	Just posters of like prepubescent boys all over the house.
373600	378600	And Dan and I have a really nice woman who comes over so often and cleans the house.
378600	379600	She what?
379600	381600	She comes and cleans the house, and I forgot to take down all these posters.
381600	385600	So she walked into this room with just like little boys with overalls
385600	389600	and boys leaning up against brick walls.
389600	390600	Remember when that was a thing?
390600	399600	Which she was able to add to her mental sort of journal of our relationship
399600	405600	because before I was going out with Erin, when we were still platonic.
405600	409600	It was just you, me, and Jeff hanging out 24-7.
409600	412600	And then, you know, you would crash at my place a lot,
412600	419600	but then the nights that you would come over, you would put on this mustache that I had.
419600	423600	Well, because Jeff put it on me a while, like before.
423600	425600	I mean, the dumb detail.
425600	427600	And so you liked having the mustache on and doing bits.
427600	432600	And I mean, she really liked having the mustache on with like spirit glue.
432600	434600	It made her really happy.
434600	435600	It's a good bit.
435600	440600	And a happy woman is a sexy woman, so I was attracted to a mustachioed woman.
440600	446600	Okay, so is this leading to like after Jeff like, why did you keep it on?
446600	453600	Well, I just like my housekeeper, Sophia, like one morning came in and we were...
453600	454600	Clean the room.
454600	456600	We had passed out in the living room.
456600	462600	And I just remember like me bolting up from the sofa as Erin bolted up from elsewhere
462600	465600	in the living room with this mustache on.
465600	470600	We had two different spots in the living room, both like sitting up going, huh, huh.
470600	472600	It's 8.30 and like she just...
472600	476600	And then sometimes Sophia would find the mustache just laying around
476600	480600	and she would carefully put it in a little drawer.
480600	484600	The drawer, it's important to note where the drawer was, which is next to the bed.
484600	485600	Yeah.
485600	486600	Yeah.
486600	487600	She knows.
487600	491600	She always put it in the little box next to the bed because she was like...
491600	492600	Did she clean it?
492600	494600	Did she clean it?
494600	495600	She calmed it.
495600	497600	She put it on a parchment paper.
497600	499600	Oh, I hate my life.
500600	503600	Oh, it's so bad.
504600	505600	Cool.
505600	508600	Our next guest is the president of Mexico.
513600	515600	He's a member of Mensa.
515600	516600	Shit.
516600	524600	He's been given a Nobel Prize recently for being a human being.
524600	528600	Dan and Rob, have either of you ever been to a baby shower?
528600	529600	Yeah.
529600	530600	JD Risner's.
530600	533600	Yeah, we were at a co-ed baby shower.
533600	535600	Yeah, we were at a co-ed baby shower.
535600	537600	We found out why they don't invite men to this thing.
537600	538600	Yeah, because we went...
538600	539600	What was it like?
539600	541600	It was just drunk and they were just shouting.
541600	542600	We thought it...
542600	547600	I think without even communicating, we were like ants, like communicating.
547600	551600	Like, this would be funny if we all got really like...
551600	552600	Bellicose.
552600	557600	Jockey, like the next time someone gives diapers, let's just hit the roof.
557600	560600	It was just like, yeah, man.
560600	561600	Right on.
561600	564600	And all the women were like...
564600	565600	At that...
565600	570600	It's traditional at baby showers to play little games that go on throughout the night.
570600	572600	Were there any games at that baby shower?
572600	575600	Is this leading to a game?
575600	579600	Tonight is Jeff Davis's 40th birthday.
579600	585600	And if you listen to the podcast, you know that Jeff always looks at the clock at exactly 9-11.
585600	586600	I've covered up the clock.
586600	589600	Oh, genius.
589600	599600	Both of you, I've made a cake with a clock on the top that's at 9-11.
599600	603600	That was like a haiku.
603600	606600	Both of you, I made a cake.
606600	608600	It was at 9-11.
608600	611600	Do you eat the cake or do you throw it away?
611600	613600	It's the rest of the haiku, but that's an extended haiku.
613600	616600	It's snow on the wind sill.
616600	617600	What is it?
617600	621600	So both of you are going to pick, if you could really fast, pick a proxy who you're going
621600	623600	to be playing for.
623600	626600	Because at 9-11, I have a clock in front of me.
626600	632600	When you think it's 9-11, the person who gets closest to the actual 9-11, your proxy will
632600	633600	win a cake.
633600	634600	Oh, okay.
634600	635600	So it's like playing for charity.
635600	636600	Well, then I'll take Anatoly.
636600	638600	He seems like really...
638600	641600	Wait, you were pointing at Anatoly?
641600	642600	I got the same kind of...
642600	643600	Oh, okay, all right, all right.
643600	645600	You sit right in front of me and you totally ganked him from me.
645600	646600	Okay, all right, all right.
646600	648600	Rob, there's a nice pillow over there.
648600	649600	Were you sitting next to Anatoly?
649600	650600	Did you come with him?
650600	651600	Yeah, I did.
651600	652600	Yeah, man.
652600	657600	Would you consider yourself his nemesis?
657600	663600	The American version of Anatoly in a pre-Cold War or pre-End of...
663600	665600	I can make some...
665600	668600	Interestingly enough, can Anatoly be Rob's proxy?
668600	669600	I'm sorry, what was...
669600	670600	What?
670600	671600	He'll say Anatoly.
671600	672600	Oh, I see, okay.
672600	673600	I'm sorry, what was your name again?
673600	674600	We've met.
674600	675600	Kurt.
675600	676600	Kurt.
676600	677600	I thought so.
677600	678600	Okay, hello.
678600	682600	So, Kurt, if you could just really quick, you guys, it's the same color scheme, and
682600	685600	I told you if you could stand next to Rob and Kurt, if you could stand next to Dan really
685600	686600	quick, just so you guys can see.
686600	687600	See?
687600	688600	I mean, come on.
688600	689600	These are exact proxies.
689600	690600	All right.
690600	691600	All right, thank you, fellas.
691600	692600	Sit down.
693600	699600	Amy's going to make me feel bad for picking the obvious choice.
699600	701600	No hints from the audience.
701600	702600	Here's the rule.
702600	705600	If you say it too soon, price is right.
705600	707600	I almost said price or right.
707600	708600	Price is right rules.
708600	710600	I hate playing games.
710600	712600	I hate games.
712600	714600	I hate games.
714600	715600	I hate games.
715600	717600	I've always hated games.
717600	721600	I hate them now more than ever, and I hate games.
721600	723600	I hate sports and games.
723600	728600	Anything where there's a winner or a loser, I absolutely hate.
728600	731600	This is just a thing that's just going on in the background.
731600	733600	Yeah, this is in the background.
733600	734600	Guess what?
734600	735600	It's a game.
735600	737600	The person who guessed it...
737600	738600	Don't like it.
738600	739600	Never liked games.
739600	740600	If you guessed before...
740600	742600	I hate games.
742600	745600	If you guessed before, it's 9-11.
745600	746600	What?
746600	747600	It's a game.
747600	748600	Then you're disqualified.
748600	749600	Closest person after.
749600	750600	It's a game.
750600	751600	Let's continue.
751600	752600	Okay.
752600	753600	And if you guessed after...
753600	754600	You lose.
754600	755600	The quickest person after.
755600	756600	The terrorist win.
756600	757600	Whatever.
757600	758600	Games.
758600	759600	I hate them.
759600	760600	Do you hate that game?
760600	763600	The War on Terror?
763600	764600	There's a winner or a loser.
764600	766600	I do not like it.
766600	768600	So you don't want us to fight the War on Terror.
768600	771600	I don't want anybody to win or lose.
771600	776600	I just want us to all have a good time and smoke a J, man.
776600	782600	We'll just sit back and watch some fucking afternoon television and just smoke a J.
782600	787600	Why don't we all smoke J's, then we wouldn't be bombing so many people.
787600	788600	Yeah.
788600	789600	Hey, man.
789600	793600	If the government would just smoke a J, it wouldn't be shut down, right?
793600	794600	How many J's?
794600	795600	How many J's?
795600	796600	How many J's?
796600	797600	How many J's?
797600	798600	How many J's?
798600	799600	How many J's?
799600	802600	Man, I smoke a whole alphabet of J's.
802600	803600	So one.
803600	804600	So one J.
805600	810600	So a whole alphabet's worth of J's.
810600	813600	Okay, maybe an alphabet and a half, okay?
813600	816600	If you stop after J.
816600	820600	I had a murder mystery birthday party for my birthday party.
820600	821600	Hate games.
821600	824600	I hated that game, too, but it's over with.
824600	825600	Yes.
825600	827600	Well, I had a murder mystery birthday party, and Rob was like,
827600	829600	is it okay if I come a little late?
829600	830600	I'm working.
830600	835600	And he came just a little too late and got murdered immediately upon entering.
835600	836600	And you know why?
836600	840600	The whole time I'm like going, and I'm going to harm, and I said,
840600	844600	I'm going to show up, and this is why I fucking hate games,
844600	850600	is because I always, whether you're playing werewolf or Scrabble or sorry
850600	856600	or 9-11 game or whatever, it's like, all right, I'm going to do it.
856600	859600	And then it's like out of the gate, okay?
859600	862600	The first one, whether it's paintball or whatever,
862600	865600	it's just like the first person to die and sit in the corner
865600	869600	and watch everybody have a good time is me.
869600	870600	All right.
870600	872600	Well, speaking of games, I have a chance.
872600	874600	Jesus.
874600	877600	Rob and I came over here together, and I was...
877600	882600	And I came with the cure, apparently.
882600	885600	He jumped in the car, and he was like, ah, this outfit.
885600	886600	And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
886600	889600	And then it wasn't until I looked in the mirror and the bathroom here,
889600	892600	I was like, oh, my God, I look like shit.
892600	893600	I look terrible.
893600	894600	All right.
894600	897600	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
897600	900600	Jeff, you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place.
900600	902600	You hate liquid colognes, is that correct?
902600	903600	It's my nemesis.
903600	906600	It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long.
906600	912600	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you just covered in sticky wet cologne.
912600	916600	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear,
916600	920600	and then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
920600	921600	Yeah.
921600	924600	But Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company
924600	927600	that specializes in solid colognes, shave, and shower products,
927600	930600	all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.
930600	933600	Now, when you say solid colognes, do you mean like solid in the jazz sense?
933600	935600	Like, wow, that jazz solo was solid.
935600	939600	You know, I do mean that, but I also mean physically solid as well.
939600	942600	Oh, like a little, like you're talking about a wax-based cologne
942600	946600	that travels in a little small package that I can't spill all over my luggage
946600	950600	and smell like a Mexican tit house.
950600	953600	So these are travel-friendly wax-based colognes that can go anywhere.
953600	957600	Plus, there's nothing to break or spill, and of course, they all smell fantastic.
957600	958600	Fantastic.
958600	961600	Like a Mexican tit house.
961600	965600	I mean, there's different levels of Mexican tit house.
965600	967600	I mean, there's the high-quality ones,
967600	969600	there's the ones that you wish you didn't go to.
969600	970600	Right, yeah.
970600	972600	Titas Fantástico.
972600	975600	Is one of their fragrances called Mexican tit house?
975600	976600	Yeah.
976600	979600	Que Fantástico.
979600	982600	Fulton and Roark's bar soap is designed to exfoliate the skin
982600	984600	with or without a washcloth.
984600	985600	Also, you don't even have to touch it.
985600	987600	It comes in desert in the night.
987600	989600	Well, that's amazing.
989600	991600	That's literally unbelievable.
991600	995600	Did you know, Spencer, that GQ magazine just named their shave cream
995600	997600	the very best on the market today?
997600	999600	Well, yeah, of course I knew that.
999600	1000600	Why would you ask?
1000600	1001600	I mean, who am I asking?
1001600	1002600	I mean, this guy.
1002600	1004600	You go to this house, it's like an episode of Hoarders.
1004600	1007600	So many back issues of GQ magazine there.
1007600	1010600	Right, and I got to tell you, my house is made out of bricks of cologne.
1010600	1012600	Wax-based cologne, I hope.
1012600	1013600	Yeah, yeah.

1042600	1046600	Different corporation by FultonAndRoark.
1046600	1052600	I made up my mind that we were going to play D&D for a really long time tonight.
1052600	1056600	But even if we don't do that, I at least want to get Spencer up here earlier than usual.
1056600	1062600	Spring up, Spencer.
1062600	1064600	Here's another thing.
1064600	1065600	Welcome, Spencer.
1065600	1066600	What?
1066600	1068600	Here's another thing I noticed, because I, of course...
1068600	1070600	What's happening?
1070600	1071600	Wait a minute, what?
1071600	1072600	Really quick.
1072600	1073600	What was that?
1073600	1075600	Was that my playoff music?
1075600	1076600	No, I...
1076600	1077600	I was talking to...
1077600	1081600	I accidentally updated my iPod and my only playlist is...
1081600	1082600	You have a giant iPod.
1082600	1083600	No, it's just...
1083600	1087600	It's just breaking bad music and TLC right now.
1087600	1089600	TLC, like, left eye and...
1089600	1091600	Yeah.
1091600	1096600	Like, what's a natural phenomenon you shouldn't go after?
1096600	1100600	Waterfalls?
1100600	1101600	Yeah.
1101600	1102600	Is that right?
1102600	1103600	Yeah, that's right.
1103600	1104600	Is it 9-11?
1104600	1106600	Are we playing a game right now?
1106600	1109600	Because I would pitch about it in the morning.
1109600	1110600	I do have a...
1110600	1111600	I have a...
1111600	1114600	Because it is Jeff's 40th birthday, I do have a Jeff...
1114600	1117600	A Jeff game for the three of you to play.
1117600	1118600	All right.
1118600	1119600	Oh, shit.
1119600	1120600	Is it?
1120600	1123600	Is it, like, a five-minute game or, like...
1123600	1126600	I don't know, like, I don't know, 90 minutes.
1126600	1129600	We don't have to play it if you don't want to.
1129600	1131600	Is it, like, questions about Jeff?
1131600	1132600	No.
1132600	1133600	Is this...
1133600	1135600	Yeah, that would be weird.
1135600	1137600	Are you going to...
1137600	1140600	That would be, like, a three-way newlywed game.
1140600	1145600	Let me see if Spencer's a conversational goldmine before we go into this game.
1145600	1147600	I'd like to think so.
1147600	1149600	Spencer, I just heard about your parents' divorce.
1149600	1150600	I'm sorry.
1150600	1151600	I...
1151600	1152600	Yeah, whatever.
1152600	1155600	I mean, maybe it's personal.
1155600	1156600	I'm not...
1156600	1157600	He announced it at...
1157600	1159600	Well, I only heard about it because I just listened to the...
1159600	1161600	To last week's show before the show.
1161600	1162600	I'm sorry.
1162600	1166600	Yeah, it was more a public concern because it turns out it was Spencer's fault.
1166600	1168600	Yeah.
1168600	1170600	I really screwed the pooch.
1170600	1173600	Did they try to abort you?
1173600	1177600	Yeah, and I've been coming back ever since.
1177600	1180600	How's your, uh...
1180600	1181600	Dice.
1181600	1182600	How's your...
1182600	1184600	Well, let me tell you, Rob.
1184600	1185600	This dice...
1185600	1186600	No, I don't know.
1186600	1188600	How's your job as my assistant going?
1188600	1189600	It's so good.
1189600	1190600	It's so great.
1190600	1191600	It's...
1191600	1194600	The only thing I don't like is that I feel like I'm worthless
1194600	1196600	and that I don't do my job right because...
1196600	1197600	Because it's so easy.
1197600	1198600	Yeah, that's why.
1198600	1200600	It's because a lot of it's just sitting down and...
1200600	1202600	Well, why don't you clean my car?
1202600	1207600	Whenever you find yourself feeling like that, just go clean my car.
1207600	1210600	This is the kind of dialogues that we need to have, yeah.
1210600	1212600	This is the kind of dialogue I need to not have
1212600	1216600	because it makes me feel like an elitist prick telling someone to clean his car.
1216600	1218600	I need you to go,
1218600	1220600	shit, I got nothing to do.
1220600	1222600	Clean that motherfucker's car.
1222600	1226600	There's a lot of Baja Fresh wrappers in the back.
1226600	1228600	I should probably take care of those.
1228600	1232600	My car gets really messy too, so I think it's just because I don't think about it
1232600	1234600	because I don't think about cleaning my car.
1234600	1236600	Rob, who are you doing an impression of?
1236600	1237600	Of me.
1237600	1238600	That was Spencer.
1238600	1240600	Yeah.
1240600	1244600	Oh, check out all the Baja Fresh wrappers in the back.
1244600	1247600	I should probably take care of these and maybe get rid of...
1247600	1249600	Is that like Thomas Hayden Church?
1250600	1253600	I'll have to get rid of these Baja Fresh wrappers in the back.
1253600	1257600	They're stuck like two shoeboxes deep back, you know?
1257600	1259600	It's like, how is anybody supposed to sit back here?
1259600	1261600	Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
1261600	1263600	Sure, ask Spencer.
1265600	1267600	It's about poop.
1268600	1270600	Is this about hot snakes?
1272600	1274600	Is that what you call poop?
1274600	1277600	I just learned about something called hot snakes today.
1277600	1280600	It's apparently a shape of poop, I guess.
1280600	1285600	I thought I might be lactose intolerant and I brought it up to my friend Nolan
1285600	1287600	and he's like, you got hot snakes?
1287600	1289600	And I'm like, what is... what?
1289600	1291600	And he's like, you must not be...
1291600	1293600	And I'm like, that doesn't mean anything.
1293600	1295600	You just said things and then diagnosed me.
1295600	1296600	I don't know.
1296600	1297600	Christopher Nolan?
1297600	1299600	No, Nolan Fabricus.
1299600	1301600	Nolan, stand up.
1301600	1303600	What's up?
1303600	1307600	Nolan is wearing a jean jacket and some tape glasses.
1307600	1309600	What's a hot snake?
1309600	1313600	It's just the kind of poop you get if you drink milk with weak stomach hair.
1313600	1314600	It's like, hot.
1314600	1316600	It's fine and regular poop and it's real.
1319600	1320600	I brought it up.
1320600	1321600	All right, Nolan, get on the mic.
1321600	1322600	Come on down there.
1327600	1332600	But isn't all... aren't all poop snakes and...
1332600	1333600	Aren't they all hot?
1333600	1335600	Because of...
1335600	1337600	Hey, man, you haven't seen mine.
1337600	1338600	This is why it's hard to explain.
1338600	1340600	It's like, it's condescending.
1340600	1343600	It's like, if you've been there, you know.
1343600	1344600	No.
1344600	1346600	Snakes resonate with anyone, please.
1346600	1348600	Defining poop is never condescending.
1348600	1349600	No matter.
1349600	1351600	Bill, are you serious?
1351600	1352600	Dude, thanks, man.
1352600	1353600	Thank you.
1353600	1358600	It's important to note that Nolan is holding a bottle of alcohol.
1358600	1359600	Yeah.
1359600	1361600	Just say, just say.
1361600	1363600	Also, the Canadian tuxedo.
1363600	1364600	What?
1364600	1366600	Double denims.
1366600	1368600	Dan, what is your poop question?
1368600	1369600	Okay.
1369600	1371600	Well, I don't know if I want Nolan up here when I do it.
1371600	1372600	Okay, give it to me.
1372600	1373600	All right, Nolan, go sit down.
1373600	1374600	Give it to me.
1374600	1375600	I really like you guys.
1375600	1376600	Thank you, Nolan.
1376600	1377600	Hot snake.
1377600	1378600	Hot snake.
1378600	1381600	He seems like a good young man.
1381600	1383600	He seems like you're rolling with a good crowd.
1383600	1385600	Selling like hot snakes.
1385600	1395600	Wait, really quick, Nolan, is that your own term, or is that a common expression, hot
1395600	1396600	snakes?
1396600	1400600	Me and my friends from where I'm from just understood what it meant.
1400600	1401600	Okay.
1401600	1402600	Okay.
1402600	1403600	All right.
1403600	1404600	Dan's poop question.
1404600	1406600	Mine doesn't have to do with the actual content.
1406600	1411600	It has to do with scheduling.
1411600	1414600	I've got an answer for this.
1414600	1418600	For as long as I can remember now, and this is not something I'm complaining about at
1418600	1426600	all, I think this might be a superpower that I have.
1426600	1430600	Every time that I eat, I poop.
1430600	1432600	No, that's good.
1432600	1434600	That's great.
1434600	1442600	I know it's not the food that I just ate because that's ridiculous, but it always seems like
1442600	1443600	that.
1443600	1444600	I have an English muffin, and then I-
1444600	1445600	Like a half hour later?
1445600	1446600	No, no.
1446600	1447600	God, no.
1447600	1448600	Not a half hour later.
1448600	1449600	When?
1449600	1450600	Okay, so you're saying-
1450600	1451600	While you're eating?
1451600	1452600	No, while I'm eating.
1452600	1456600	You're not saying the obvious thing that everything you eat, you poop out, right?
1456600	1457600	You're saying when I eat-
1457600	1461800	That's the cartoon illusion that happens because of what's happening is I just have perfect
1461800	1463560	synchronization, I guess.
1463560	1471280	I'm always filled with food, and then I put one meal in my mouth, and then it moves everything
1472280	1473280	down, and one poop comes out.
1473280	1474280	You're chewing your bowels.
1474280	1475280	I mean, it's psychological.
1475280	1476280	It's like a-
1476280	1482400	Every time your tongue tastes like sugar and salt, it's like time to get it going, like
1482400	1483400	it's like a stopper.
1483400	1484400	I think it does-
1484400	1487600	Are you using the editorial you, or are you telling me how my-
1487600	1488840	You, you, you, Dan Harmon.
1488840	1489840	Me personally?
1489840	1490840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1490840	1495840	Like other people are cued by like, ah, Mory's on.
1495840	1507320	Or, I mean, I don't really like talking about my bathroom business, but-
1507320	1512240	You like to let it do, it's talking for you.
1512240	1515240	I mean, before I have like a big thing happening-
1515240	1518320	Shit, shit coming out of your ass.
1518320	1524840	When I started doing improv, I got really superstitious about pooping before a show,
1524840	1527960	because I would get nervous, and then I would poop before a show, and then have a great
1527960	1528960	show.
1528960	1532840	Whether those two things are related.
1532840	1534840	Well, it's just like-
1534840	1535840	You're not sure.
1535840	1536840	It's psychological.
1536840	1537840	Yeah, I don't know.
1537840	1538840	Whatever.
1538840	1539840	I think it's perfect to poop right as you eat.
1539840	1543840	Like, I've always wanted to do that, because, you know, it's just, you got, it's like clockwork,
1543840	1546560	because you got garbage in, garbage out.
1546560	1551440	It's on a cycle, it's synchronized, it sounds, it sounds like I've honestly wanted to do
1551440	1552440	that.
1552440	1553440	Totally, totally.
1553440	1554440	It's obviously psychological.
1555040	1556040	Yeah.
1556040	1560440	I think I've just wandered into some kind of perfect, I just don't want to screw it up,
1560440	1561440	whatever it is.
1561440	1563440	Spencer, what's your poop cue?
1563440	1567920	In the morning it sucks, because, like, I have to go pee in the morning.
1567920	1569840	That happens to people.
1569840	1574680	But like, I always have to go pee, and then go poop, but I only have to go poop like 50
1574680	1577640	minutes after I go pee, and it's like in the morning when I'm trying to sleep, so I got
1577640	1581600	to get up to go to the bathroom twice, and that just kills any chance I have of getting
1581600	1583720	back to sleep in the morning.
1583720	1584720	Just resist it.
1584720	1585720	Nope.
1587720	1593840	Somebody asked me, like, a couple weeks ago, like, what's some advice on, you know, directing?
1593840	1600480	And I said, you know, do a shot, Liz, whether you need it or not, you know, your crew thinks
1600480	1602920	you're working.
1602920	1609680	Always, you know, talk to your actors, and the most important thing, take a shit before
1609680	1616120	you leave the house in the morning, because shitting on set is, like, the most disgusting
1616120	1617680	thing in the world.
1617680	1619000	It's terrible.
1619000	1625960	So every morning before I go on set, like, I'll force myself to take a shit, because
1625960	1626960	that sounds like it.
1626960	1632360	But I mean, my brain is like, okay, you got to take a shit now.
1632360	1635320	So your poop cue is needing to be on set?
1635320	1636320	Yeah.
1636320	1640680	It's a definite, like, scare if I, for some reason, miss it, like, I get up super early
1640680	1644640	and I forget the shit, like, I'm driving, I'll be panicking.
1644640	1650080	Because if I, because I have a, Dan, you know this, I have a love-hate relationship with
1650080	1651080	my ass.
1651080	1661800	I've talked about this before on the show, and if I go to number two, I need to be clean
1661800	1662800	the rest of the day.
1662800	1668080	So I'll jump in the shower, usually, to clean it off.
1668080	1670440	You can't do that when you're on set.
1670440	1672240	He's obsessive about his butt.
1672240	1673240	Yes.
1673240	1674240	Yeah.
1674240	1675240	And I've known that-
1675240	1678240	Why did it get all real quiet out here?
1678240	1680400	Is everybody leaning in or leaning back?
1680400	1681400	I don't understand.
1681400	1686440	I mean, Rob, I've known about your anal obsession for a while.
1686440	1688400	It's not an anal obsession.
1688400	1690680	I like to be clean.
1691200	1694480	But my question is, like, when you clean yourself in the shower, and I've thought this before
1694480	1699920	and I've never had the gumption to ask you, do you bend over, like, the copper-tone girl?
1699920	1701400	Or, like, what do you do?
1701400	1702560	No, no, no, no, no.
1702560	1706680	I mean, like, at one point, I had the snake.
1706680	1707680	The hot snake?
1707680	1708680	Don't use a hot snake.
1708680	1709680	Is that what you meant?
1709680	1710680	Is that what you meant?
1710680	1716080	Yeah, I had, like, the shower snake, and that got, like, unhealthy, which, go back to podcasts.
1716080	1717080	You scalded yourself.
1717080	1718080	You scalded my-
1718080	1719080	And you went to the doctor.
1719080	1723640	And the doctor was like, oh, my God, what the fuck did you do to your ass?
1723640	1724640	And I was like, what?
1724640	1725640	What are you talking about?
1725640	1726640	And then he-
1726640	1728240	I was like, I'll call you about it.
1728240	1729240	Really?
1729240	1730240	Is there something wrong?
1730240	1731240	But you were flattered that he noticed?
1731240	1732240	Yeah.
1732240	1733240	What do you mean?
1733240	1734240	This whole thing?
1734240	1735240	Yeah.
1735240	1738240	I just threw this together, you know?
1738240	1741040	No big deal.
1741040	1745880	When I was 10 years old, my family went camping in Alabama.
1745880	1749600	And when you go camp- it was a campground where there was a shower that was, like,
1749600	1751280	a communal shower.
1751280	1753720	And I was 9 or 10 years old.
1753720	1757360	And I went and I was taking a shower by myself.
1757360	1758360	And-
1758360	1759360	Good.
1759360	1763640	I was taking a shower by myself.
1763640	1767560	Granted, there was- my uncle was there, and I was asking me to pretend like I was surfing.
1767560	1768560	But I was-
1768560	1769560	What?
1769560	1770560	I was moving by myself.
1770560	1771560	Thank you.
1771560	1772560	Thank you for those.
1772560	1773560	Adam's a nice reference.
1773560	1774560	So it's a reference to-
1774560	1775560	Silver Surfer.
1776240	1777240	Smart guy.
1777240	1781040	Smart guy to the sitcom Smart Guy, where there's a pedophile episode, and he asks a kid to
1781040	1783320	take his shirt off and pretend like he's surfing.
1783320	1784320	Anyway-
1784320	1792800	There was a different Strokes pedophile episode when I was your age, and it was Gordon Jump
1792800	1793800	from WKRP.
1793800	1797680	He was the pedophile, and he took Dudley and Arnold into the bathroom.
1797680	1800680	And they played Poseidon.
1800680	1808560	That would be the Kurt Russell one, or-
1808560	1809560	Kurt Russell?
1809560	1810560	No, it was Gordon Jump.
1810560	1811560	Oh, okay.
1811560	1812560	I mean, Poseidon.
1812560	1813560	Good reference.
1813560	1814560	Oh, Jesus Christ, you guys.
1814560	1817560	I mean, all I wanted to do was play D&D.
1817560	1819560	That was very-
1819560	1820560	So you went camping.
1820560	1821560	I can't believe you're telling this story.
1821560	1822560	This is amazing.
1822560	1826920	I went camping, and I was in the shower.
1826920	1828600	I was there by myself.
1828600	1831880	And I had to poop very badly.
1831880	1832880	And there was a drain there.
1832880	1835080	And you know, when you were a kid, maybe I was younger than 10.
1835080	1839200	No, no, it was certainly 10.
1839200	1840360	And I saw the drain there.
1840360	1841360	I had to poop very badly.
1841360	1844840	And I just didn't understand the physics of poop and a drain.
1844840	1848360	And so I squatted down and pooped on the drain.
1848360	1853240	And there was a solid poop, like a solid log on top of the drain.
1853240	1857680	A cold snake.
1857760	1860920	You were hoping for a bunch of baby snakes to come out and-
1860920	1861920	Oh.
1861920	1862920	Bye.
1862920	1867880	I just thought it would wash away the same way that pee did in an ocean, but I pooped
1867880	1868880	in the drain.
1868880	1870840	And I finished my shower and wouldn't go away.
1870840	1874000	And I was just like, oh, I'll leave it there.
1874000	1875000	It's fine.
1875000	1877360	And I went back to join my family.
1877360	1882400	And a couple hours later, my mom and I are doing something.
1882400	1883680	We're making dinner.
1883680	1884760	And she goes to the bathroom.
1884760	1885760	She comes back disgusted.
1885840	1893800	And it's like, some animal, some monster went and defecated.
1893800	1898360	My mother was very waspy, defecated in the shower and didn't clean up after themselves.
1898360	1899360	What animal?
1899360	1903040	They should have, like, was going on and on about, like, I don't know where they were
1903040	1906840	raised and what their values are.
1906840	1911480	And McGathey's, we would never.
1911480	1912480	We would never.
1913480	1920800	And I'm just sitting there, like, baking or doing- not baking, on a campsite.
1920800	1922400	I'm sitting there fixing the television.
1922400	1925280	No, I'm doing something.
1925280	1928840	And I'm just listening to her go on and on about how our family is better than other
1928840	1933320	families because- and the guilt, like, just this weight.
1933320	1937600	And when she was done, I was like, mom, I- it was me.
1937600	1938600	I pooped.
1938600	1940600	Pooped in the shower.
1941600	1942960	I couldn't hold it.
1942960	1947560	When you're young, you don't- that's actually a very interesting, like, because you don't
1947560	1948560	understand-
1948560	1949560	A reflex to that, yeah.
1949560	1954080	You don't understand, like, how things, like, you don't understand physics, you know, like,
1954080	1957960	how- because in your mind, you have a cartoon of it going in.
1957960	1961600	When I pooped my pants when I was a kid and I just took my underwear, I knew I wasn't
1961600	1966120	supposed to do it, so I took my dirty underwear and I opened the window to my bedroom and
1966120	1972960	I just threw them out because I thought that outside was, like, the garbage.
1972960	1975080	And I thought the garbage was magic.
1975080	1980840	Probably- but probably because you were walking around and you- walking over from school and
1980840	1986480	you said, oh, there's a shoe there, there's a- a piece of, uh, there was, like, a sock
1986480	1988480	there, and you go, well-
1988480	1989480	I also-
1989480	1992440	My mom eventually goes, like, um, did you poop your pants?
1992440	1994600	I'm like, no, absolutely not.
1995240	1997240	It's on her head, like a hat.
1997240	1999240	She was mowing a lawn.
1999240	2001240	She's like, you poop your pants?
2001240	2005240	She's holding a pair of hedge trimmers and a grimace, uh-
2005240	2012600	And I put in my ears, like, I'm Alec Baldwin in the hearing in Malice, you know, I'm all
2012600	2013600	cocky about it.
2013600	2014600	No!
2014600	2016600	I did not poop.
2016600	2017600	A God complex?
2017600	2018600	I'm God.
2019600	2024520	When I- a year later, I was walking home from soccer practice and I had, like, accidentally
2024520	2028480	peed my pants before, just like every kid does, and I was-
2028480	2029480	How old?
2029480	2031480	11 or 12.
2031480	2032480	Too old.
2032480	2036800	Walking home from soccer practice, walking with, uh, my neighbor, and, like, I had to
2036800	2040000	pee really badly, and I was just wearing soccer shorts and a soccer jersey.
2040000	2043200	And because, like, from experience, like, oh, if I pee a little on my pants, no one
2043200	2044200	really knows.
2044200	2046360	And I had- I had to pee so bad.
2046360	2047360	True.
2047360	2049240	And I was like, I'll just- I'll just let it go.
2049240	2051280	And I just peed all over my shoes and I was walking next to my-
2051280	2052280	What?
2052280	2055280	You, like, you did a gesture for the podcast.
2055280	2057440	She- Aaron just did a gesture from her shoulders.
2057440	2058440	Yeah.
2058440	2059440	Oh, I pee out of my neck.
2059440	2060440	You guys pee out of your neck.
2060440	2061440	Like, what?
2061440	2065200	You didn't go up or- Like, she said, Andrew, I'm a bottle full
2065200	2066200	of pee.
2066200	2067200	Wow.
2067200	2069960	I just emptied myself.
2069960	2070960	That's a healthy pee.
2070960	2075800	From the top of my spout to- And a strong sweatshirt.
2076800	2084120	And I know that my friend and my neighbor noticed, but just, like, had the, like, allowed
2084120	2088640	me to stay face enough to not mention it, but I peed all over my shorts and on the ground.
2088640	2089640	There's a trail.
2089640	2090920	There's a river behind me.
2090920	2094360	And she was just like, so, are you watching Saved by the Bellator or, like, what's going
2094360	2095360	on?
2095360	2096360	Like, just walking.
2096360	2097360	I'll just pee all over myself.
2097360	2101200	Then to that poop story is that my mom made me go in and watch me clean it up.
2101200	2102200	Wow.
2102200	2103200	All right, pee.
2103200	2104200	I mean, that's amazing.
2105200	2107720	I mean, that's a pretty strong family.
2107720	2115520	I mean, I'm very impressed by being 10 years old and having all of that pressure actually
2115520	2116520	to lie.
2116520	2119760	I mean, the path of least resistance there.
2119760	2124080	And also, like, actually, I mean, you knew you were going to really disappoint your mom
2124080	2125080	by telling her that.
2125080	2126080	Yeah.
2126080	2127080	She was making it extra apparent.
2127080	2130280	That's interesting because- But you wanted to tell her out of guilt, which is really
2130280	2131280	interesting.
2131280	2133680	Actually, your dad was a pastor.
2133680	2135120	There's a different force there.
2135120	2142440	I know my parents, like, my mom would say, do I have to get out the Bible?
2142440	2143680	It was a deal breaker for me.
2143680	2151360	No matter how fucking cold to write, so I had my alibi, like, she had established this
2151360	2157040	concept that if you lie while you put your hand on the Bible, you go to hell.
2157040	2161560	And not only go to hell, but my mom went to show me articles about, this is going
2161560	2168720	to make my mom sound like some kind of crazy character from Justified, but I mean, I take
2168720	2169720	that back.
2169720	2170720	She didn't show me articles.
2170720	2171720	She told me about articles.
2171720	2175760	She said, in the news, there's this thing called spontaneous combustion.
2175760	2177760	Have you ever heard of that?
2177760	2180000	The people will just be walking down the street, they'll just burst into flames.
2180000	2181520	Why do you think that happens?
2181520	2185760	I think we figured out later that spontaneous combustion is people that fell asleep in a
2185760	2190280	room with no air flow with a cigarette in their hand, and there's a set of circumstances
2190280	2194400	that causes the body not to burst into flames.
2194400	2198760	They call it spontaneous combustion because you don't find the body until it's like basically
2198760	2201920	like sort of smoldered for a month.
2201920	2207800	And so when you find it, it looks like someone that just must have exploded into flames.
2207800	2210720	I don't think that's why they call it spontaneous combustion, though.
2210720	2212240	What do you mean?
2212240	2216000	It's because they spontaneously burst into flames without any fire.
2216000	2217640	But that's what they think.
2217640	2218640	It's like crib death.
2218640	2223520	Yeah, but you were saying they call it spontaneous combustion because you don't find them until
2223520	2224520	a month later.
2224520	2225520	That's not why.
2225520	2226960	So are you talking to your parents about?
2226960	2230720	I meant they call it spontaneous combustion even though they never actually saw a person
2230720	2233080	spontaneously combust.
2233080	2239080	What they would find is like these half-chart carcasses that when you look at the crime
2239080	2245480	scene or whatever it is, it looks like spontaneous combustion occurred.
2245480	2246480	It wasn't spontaneous.
2246480	2253200	It was a slow rendering of body fat over the course of a month with no friends or no support
2253200	2254200	system.
2254200	2262760	Isn't that like an industrial age idea or like a post-Adwardian like was partnered with
2262760	2263760	just your mom calling it news.
2263760	2264760	That's all.
2264760	2265760	I know she didn't say.
2265760	2271920	In the Milwaukee Times, they didn't say.
2271920	2275440	You don't have to attack my mom.
2275440	2280040	I peed my pants two years ago.
2280040	2281440	This is another heroic story.
2281440	2284560	This is about you taking back the night.
2284560	2292160	Yeah, because all these stories about like this oppression of like children like if you're
2292160	2297600	caught peeing in your pants, like children are awful, like they'll go, look at Robbie,
2297600	2303280	he peed his pants and the teachers are going, you peed your pants and the mom goes, you
2303280	2304280	peed your pants.
2304280	2305280	What does Jack Nicholson do?
2305280	2309280	You peed your pants, man.
2309280	2311280	What is America of a spoochie dude?
2311280	2314920	Go back, you peed your pants.
2314920	2315920	What does Susan Sarandon say?
2315920	2316920	Susan Sarandon says, you peed your pants.
2316920	2317920	I don't.
2317920	2320920	Anyway, it just gets going.
2320920	2325640	What does Too Faced say?
2325640	2328160	You peed your, both of your pants.
2328160	2331600	Really quick, what does Spencer say?
2331600	2335960	This is all you peed your pants in the back, I better clean that out, better get all these
2335960	2339320	bell tacos out of here.
2339320	2341600	That sounds kind of like an American The Beatles.
2341600	2342600	Yeah.
2342600	2343600	It does.
2343600	2345280	American The Beatles.
2345280	2349240	Oh, which a top Liverpool accent.
2349240	2350240	They're from Stinkpool.
2350240	2359080	No, but I was, I live in, you've been in a situation where you're like, you know, at
2359080	2364480	Fox or you're on the other side, you're in Santa Monica or something like that and you're
2364480	2367880	leave a meeting, you're going, oh, all right, great talking to you.
2367880	2368880	All right.
2368880	2369880	All right.
2369880	2370880	We'll see you later.
2370880	2376840	So, kind of go to the bathroom, I'll be fine and I'll go to the bathroom when I get home.
2376840	2386640	So I drive from, so I'm driving from like, over by Santa, by Fox, driving down Olympic
2386640	2399920	to get to, to Los Feliz where I live and halfway there I go, shit, I have to pee.
2399920	2402120	And it gets worse and worse.
2402120	2407960	And I'm like, I'm doing the butt dance in the car going, oh, God damn it, another red
2407960	2408960	light.
2408960	2414680	And I'm just like, oh, and like, it's starting to hurt and I'm crossing my, uncrossing my
2414680	2420680	legs and I'm doing like the thigh slap and I'm turning up the air conditioner, rolling
2420680	2423200	up and down the window.
2423200	2424200	Rolling them up and down.
2424200	2425200	Up and down.
2425200	2430800	And I'm just keeping my mind and other stuff and I'm just like, okay, just hold on.
2430800	2431800	All the tricks.
2431800	2432800	Yeah.
2432800	2433800	Yeah.
2433800	2434800	You had a rabbit in the glove box.
2434800	2441080	I get to that place on Virgil where it's like, you know, next to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
2441080	2442080	or whatever.
2442080	2447680	And at one point I like go, I could go to the Kentucky Fried Chicken at this red light,
2447680	2450360	run out, take a piss and come back.
2450360	2455160	But for some reason, my brain thinking that there was like a toilet, it started going,
2456120	2464320	I'm going to open up the floodgates and I go, crap and grab my crotch and kind of tap
2464320	2465320	it off.
2465320	2466320	Yeah.
2466320	2467320	Like a tourniquet.
2467320	2471360	And then everything else goes all the way up to where, where my things are.
2471360	2472360	And I'm like, okay.
2472360	2473360	Well, this is.
2473360	2475360	Wait, like a, like a snake smalling a mouse?
2475360	2477360	Like, what do you mean?
2477360	2478360	What?
2478360	2479360	Okay.
2479360	2480360	Okay.
2480560	2481560	I'm with a penis, Jeff.
2481560	2482560	Right.
2482560	2483560	Yeah.
2486560	2487560	It's a, it's a hose.
2487560	2488560	Okay.
2488560	2489560	Right.
2489560	2493200	Pretend like it's a garden hose and you turned on the water and the water's going up to the
2493200	2494200	top.
2494200	2497360	So it would resemble a snake swallowing a mouse.
2497360	2500120	It's throwing up a mouse.
2500120	2501120	It's not swallowing anything.
2501120	2503120	I think the mouse is the pee, as she's saying?
2503120	2504120	Yeah.
2504120	2505120	You'll have to forgive her.
2505120	2507120	She hasn't seen a penis in a month.
2507880	2508880	All right.
2508880	2514680	Well, anyway, anyway, most guys know when you do that, it's, you're beyond the point
2514680	2519840	of no return because the minute you go like this, it's everywhere.
2519840	2521320	And this was with the pants on.
2521320	2527920	So it's like, I'm, I'm, this is, I'm dead man walking right here because yeah, I can
2527920	2534360	drive home with one hand, but the minute I walk out of the car next to the fucking Armenian
2534360	2540120	people that live next door to me, that hate me and I hate them because they park me in,
2540120	2544840	I'm going to open up the door, holding my crotch, looking at them.
2544840	2549680	They're looking at me with their fat, ugly, retarded kids and just, I'm just going to
2549680	2552080	be like, you know, and I should have done this.
2552080	2561080	I should have said, boom, this is what you wanted to see people fireworks, but I didn't
2561080	2562880	give them the satisfaction.
2562880	2568800	You know, and I'm having like this, this internal dialogue the entire way home.
2568800	2572080	And I'm like going, I really screwed up this time.
2572080	2576480	Really having a bad, like sweaty, hot, painful, really painful.
2576480	2581960	Like I felt like I'm doing some damage, like the virus is going to blow up or this is really,
2581960	2584480	somebody's going to tell me, you know, you really shouldn't have done that.
2584480	2588520	I always, I always think about Abe Simpson and the Simpsons like when they're in the
2588520	2593440	episode where Homer makes his, his dad hold his pee in the car and that, and that, and
2593440	2594440	his kidneys explode.
2594440	2595440	Yeah.
2595440	2596440	I feel like that.
2596440	2597440	I always imagine that in my head.
2597440	2598440	Yeah.
2598440	2600920	I feel like that, you know, I'm getting to that age, you know, and I was like, and I'm
2600920	2605280	just driving along and driving along and all these like insecurities of like, Oh, Robbie,
2605280	2610280	you peed your pants or Robbie, you peed your pants, Robbie, you peed your pants, Robbie,
2610280	2611280	they're all flying by.
2611280	2614280	The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
2615040	2619000	Full score and seven years ago, you peed your pants.
2619000	2630600	For some reason Wesley Snipes comes through, always bet on Rob peeing his pants and I, and
2630600	2636000	I kind of like just said to the universe and I said, you know, something at the time I'm
2636000	2640400	39 years old, I'm an adult.
2640400	2643280	I can do whatever the fuck I want.
2643280	2647040	And I went boom.
2647040	2655120	And I pissed all over myself and I said, it's my car, my pants, my life.
2655120	2665720	And I drove home with the, take that Obama, and the music was cracked.
2665720	2673040	And the very first thing I did after I pissed my pants, I put my headset on and I called
2673040	2679280	Ryan Ridley and I go, guess what I just did?
2679280	2680920	And I told him the whole thing.
2680920	2687720	And he said, so bad ass man agreed with me.
2687720	2688720	That's what you get.
2688720	2689720	Heroes come in all sizes.
2689720	2690720	I learned that from Willow.
2690720	2691720	Let's play some D&D.
2691720	2692720	Yeah.
2693720	2698720	Sorry that that was long and forced in there, but I had to shit.
2698720	2699720	No, that's what we were building to.
2699720	2703560	And in answer to your question from before, why did they get quiet, audiences are conditioned
2703560	2711140	when people start talking about human shit to expect a dramatic evolution to happen.
2711140	2713120	Because it's always darkest before the dawn.
2713120	2719320	They know from storytelling and their bones, they're literally talking about fecal matter.
2719320	2724280	So it can't get any worse, which means there's going to be some kind of bloom of humanity,
2724280	2725280	a triumph.
2725280	2727560	Unless Dino's here.
2727560	2729400	In which case, yeah, there's more to go.
2729400	2731160	Yeah, we can go deeper.
2731160	2733160	I really try, I keep trying to get Dino down here.
2733160	2734320	Yeah, you won't get him down here.
2734320	2736520	Yeah, it's hard to wrangle him.
2736520	2739240	He keeps on peeing in the car on the way over.
2739240	2740240	He's a free spirit.
2740240	2746600	That was a one time thing, I'm not like peeing my pants, I'm not walking into a board room
2746600	2748720	and going, hey, how you doing?
2748720	2752240	I don't apologize to these 25 year olds, they don't know what it's like.
2752240	2755800	I'm apologizing to the would be hirers of mine.
2755800	2762600	These guys are seven years past just not peeing their pants for real.
2762600	2765600	I think, what?
2765600	2767600	Really?
2767600	2770920	They're that young, they're like, oh shit, I'm working this.
2770920	2776080	Just give me a glow stick, I'm going to rave, I just stopped peeing my pants.
2776080	2779960	But you and I are in a new, we're Gandalf the White.
2779960	2782960	We got killed by a ball rock, we don't give a fuck.
2782960	2788320	That's how I felt, I felt like Gandalf, it was just like if I walked in, you know, like
2788320	2792560	he just came in, you know, and just piss everywhere.
2792560	2795440	I felt the same way when I was walking home from that soccer practice.
2795440	2798440	Was that like you felt like a hero?
2798440	2803280	You shouldn't have, you were a monster, trail of piss behind you.
2804280	2811280	Well, my car was, were my shoes, my feet, let's play some D&D.
2814280	2819280	What happened, and somebody, okay, yes, let's.
2819280	2823280	I don't, but I can see the clock now through the paper, somehow that happened.
2823280	2824280	Stop looking at it.
2824280	2825280	I can see what time it is.
2825280	2828280	I forgot about the game, so I'm going to lose anyway.
2828280	2834880	Can I read, can I read, can we use this music for me to read one Reddit comment that I got
2834880	2841400	today in the community subreddit in response to me talking about how I don't like it when
2841400	2844440	people's, no, well okay, you can play the music again in a second.
2844440	2850720	This is a comment in response to me starting a thread where I expressed the emotion, didn't
2850720	2855680	want it, I don't care about the debate, I don't care, expressed the emotion, which made
2855680	2856680	me feel a lot better.
2856680	2858800	I have a very good mood because I did this today.
2858800	2864680	I expressed the fact that when people blame season four on season three, it makes me want
2864680	2865680	to kill myself.
2865680	2870320	It makes me want to barf and die, it bums me out.
2870320	2874280	It doesn't mean stop doing it, it doesn't mean you're wrong, it doesn't mean anything.
2874280	2881120	I just want to say, reading, when I stumble into a Reddit thread where somebody eventually
2881120	2887160	brings up and they often do, well, if you think about it, the reason season four sucked
2887160	2893400	is because season three did this, this, and that, and it, and, I'm just saying it bums
2893400	2894400	me out.
2894400	2895400	I don't want to hash it out.
2895400	2896400	I know you don't want to answer that.
2896400	2900680	Because then it's misquoted tomorrow in a thing and it's funny, but I just want to read
2900680	2901680	this one.
2901680	2908920	Well, quote this, I don't get it, and it's great.
2908920	2911080	People shower me with praise and I'm not complaining about anything.
2911080	2914800	I want to read this one comment that I got in addition to all the amazing things people
2914800	2918760	say to me all the time online, I have a great life, more than I deserve, I have nothing
2918760	2919760	to complain about.
2919760	2920760	I'm not.
2920760	2921760	You are more than you deserve.
2921760	2923080	You are more than you deserve.
2923080	2928960	I'm not a martyr, I don't have a bad life, I'm rich and satisfied and I do everything
2928960	2935960	I want to do, but I think this is just a funny thing that I received as a comment amidst
2935960	2937640	the other comments.
2937640	2941400	So cue the music.
2941400	2947160	Shut up, you faggot.
2947160	2949520	So wrong.
2949520	2953520	Your show is a worthless, oh sorry, god damn, I fucked it up.
2953520	2957840	Start it over for the edit, start it over for the edit.
2957840	2958840	Go.
2958840	2959840	Wow.
2959840	2967040	Dustin, that was for you to sync the audio for your, your feral audio.
2967040	2973320	You can sync the audio there for your podcast, sync the audio to the time track so the tracks
2973320	2974320	are timed.
2974320	2975320	Is it possible to demo that?
2975320	2980480	Dustin, another person that hates my guts on Instagram, all right, go, all right, more
2980480	2981480	on that.
2981480	2982480	No, backstory, fuck it.
2982480	2987760	All right, all right.
2987760	2990640	Shut up, you faggot.
2990640	2993520	Your show is worthless and so are you.
2993520	3002720	If you weren't a worthless piece of shit, you could make good TV, like Breaking Bad.
3002720	3010600	But you're worthless, so just wait until this season lives up to nobody's expectations,
3010600	3018400	fails to please the network, gets canned, and you kill yourself, faggot.
3018400	3032640	Well, it's over, that's it then, oh, okay, oh, oh, it's a still photo, okay, faggot.
3032640	3042480	Ooh, I think I'll be using Mayfair on this one.
3042480	3048240	Mayfair, definitely a Mayfair situation.
3048240	3054960	What do you think, what do you think that commenter's definition of fag is?
3054960	3056800	Someone who won't read his pilot.
3056800	3066640	Let's play some D&D, here we go, Dungeons and Dragons time.
3066640	3070640	Let's welcome to the, explaining Spencer Crittenden.
3070640	3079760	What, what am I, explain, can you explain that?
3079760	3084800	I didn't know how to articulate, uh, take it away, Spencer, uh, I guess the show said
3084800	3086800	take it away, Spencer.
3086800	3088800	I think it's 9-11 right now.
3088800	3090800	Uh, you're early, Rob wins!
3090800	3098400	Oh my god, it's the smartest person on stage, finally.
3099120	3101280	Anatoly, will you come to the stage really quick?
3106880	3111920	Anatoly, while we're waiting for the cake, will you just list everything that you like?
3111920	3113680	Just, just words, not sentences.
3115120	3121360	Like, I like sugar, I like, I hate sugar, uh-uh, just, just say words that you like.
3121360	3124240	Don't give him cake, he's got a bow in his hair.
3124240	3125840	Talk about the bow.
3125840	3129440	Yeah, let's talk about the bow, because it's, it's like right in my face.
3130400	3135280	Alright, we're gonna sing Happy Birthday to Jeff Davis, who is, well,
3135280	3137840	we are honoring tonight by replacing him.
3139760	3143360	Who is, uh, dear to our hearts, and so, and so wonderful.
3144000	3148000	He, he was traveling a lot this month, so he, so he, uh, whatever.
3148000	3150640	Let's wish, uh, let's sing a, he'll listen to this episode.
3151360	3174640	Happy birthday to Jeff, happy birthday to Jeff, happy birthday dear Jeff, happy birthday to you.
3182080	3182560	There you go.
3185680	3187920	By the way, I hate the Happy Birthday song.
3187920	3190160	Isn't it copyrighted? Like, are we in trouble?
3191120	3191680	What?
3191680	3193520	Isn't it a copyrighted song?
3193520	3195120	No, you know what we can do?
3195120	3198080	Could we edit this in, because no one's, you know what I do,
3198080	3201600	because I hate the Happy Birthday song, because I have a theory,
3201600	3204640	nobody wants to sing it, and nobody wants to hear it.
3205440	3205940	Right?
3206800	3208000	Let's change that, what do you want to...
3208000	3209840	Everybody's just kind of sitting there going,
3210800	3212960	because it sounds like you're in church right now.
3215840	3220240	And then there's some idiot in the background harmonizing, and you're just like, boo.
3222320	3227040	Happy birthday to you.
3227040	3229200	Like, shoot that guy.
3229200	3233840	What we do, what we do, uh, Kate and I's birthday, we sing Eddie Murphy.
3235440	3236720	So we sing Eddie Murphy.
3236720	3238640	Can we, can we do that real quick?
3238640	3240000	No, it's the same song, you're just...
3240000	3240640	No, it's not.
3241760	3246080	Eddie Murphy to you.
3246080	3247760	It's the same song, same song.
3247760	3251680	Eddie Murphy to you.
3251680	3252160	If that...
3252160	3254480	We're all smiling, Eddie.
3254480	3259360	Murphy, dare to dare.
3259360	3259840	I mean...
3259840	3266880	Eddie Murphy to you.
3266960	3270240	So he loves it, you love it if you can put your stink on it.
3270240	3270800	Yes.
3270800	3274640	Yeah, you're an artist, you demand cultural advocacy.
3274640	3276960	Nobody likes a happy birthday song.
3276960	3278000	Rob, Rob, Rob.
3278000	3280960	Nobody likes hearing it, no one likes singing it,
3280960	3284480	it's just one of these bullshit things that we fucking do,
3284480	3287120	and I know we're cutting into Dungeons and Dragons.
3287120	3288000	It's fine.
3288000	3289680	First of all, congrats on your win.
3289680	3293680	Second of all, I agree with you, I hate the happy birthday song,
3293680	3295600	but what I hate more than the happy birthday song
3295600	3297760	is when you're like Benny Hana or wherever,
3297760	3299280	and they have their own like,
3299280	3301840	Happy Happy Birthday, sprinkles and a thing and a...
3301840	3302720	We'll take it all the...
3302720	3303440	Like their own...
3304640	3305360	Do you like that?
3305360	3305920	Yeah, just sing Eddie Murphy.
3305920	3307280	Just sing Eddie Murphy.
3307280	3308480	You just don't like the lyrics,
3308480	3310160	you don't like saying happy birthday.
3310160	3310640	I don't like saying it.
3310640	3312720	He just wants control, he's just a control freak.
3313760	3314880	Let me ask you a question.
3314880	3317200	He talks about winning and losing games and things,
3317200	3318480	he's a control freak.
3318480	3319600	That is not true.
3319600	3320880	Where did you guys meet?
3320880	3322560	What was the first night that you two met?
3322560	3323920	At a control convention.
3324880	3325520	He was...
3325520	3326240	He was running it.
3326240	3327200	You were hosting a panel?
3328320	3329680	I like how you say,
3329680	3330960	Rob's a control freak.
3332480	3333600	I didn't say I wasn't.
3333600	3336000	Dan Harmon sings Rob's a control freak,
3336000	3336960	puts him in his place.
3337600	3342800	How dare you come on Harmon Town and say you're a control freak.
3342800	3343760	I didn't say I wasn't.
3343760	3346000	I don't know, we get along because of it.
3346000	3349200	I don't like the birthday song.
3349200	3350800	I don't like hearing it.
3350800	3352640	On my birthday, I'm sitting there,
3352640	3353600	everybody's looking at me,
3353600	3357120	singing this funeral dirge of a song
3358160	3361040	that these two old money-grubbing ladies
3361040	3363120	going, every time somebody sings it,
3363120	3365280	we get 10%, fuck you.
3368400	3372000	Rob, do you remember the first moment that you saw Dan?
3372000	3372240	Yes.
3372960	3373520	Tell me about it.
3373520	3374240	I think so.
3374240	3374800	What was it?
3374800	3377520	I think we were doing stand-up in Los...
3378720	3382320	We were doing stand-up in Milwaukee at the LA freeway.
3382320	3383840	I've told this story too many times.
3384400	3388560	And I was playing make tracks because I was nervous
3388560	3390640	because I was about to do stand-up for the first time.
3390640	3391200	And I think...
3391200	3393280	What is a make track?
3393280	3397760	It's a video game, coin-operated video game.
3397760	3402080	It was a third-tier Pac-Man rip-off.
3402080	3403040	Anyone?
3403040	3404960	There was a barrel hoop and a stick.
3406240	3407840	When you said make track, I thought that was an old...
3407840	3409840	And the object was to keep the pipe rolling.
3409840	3411520	Bowler hat on.
3411600	3414240	I thought that was an antiquated term for a mix tape.
3414240	3415680	It was all sepia tone.
3415680	3416640	And they do a mix track.
3419520	3421200	And I was like, boy.
3421200	3422240	I didn't know what it was either.
3422240	3423760	I'm about to go up next.
3423760	3425360	I hope I can figure this out.
3425360	3427520	He said it in my first impulse was to imagine
3427520	3433760	a 20, 25-year-old Rob touching some kind of touchpad thing
3433760	3435520	on the bar of a thing, but then realizing
3435520	3437200	we didn't even have cell phones back then.
3437200	3438400	He said herdy gerties.
3438400	3440480	In the movies, you knew someone was rich
3440560	3443760	because they would pull out a giant VHS cassette-sized phone.
3444640	3445680	No one had cell phones.
3445680	3446320	This is how...
3446320	3447360	We were walking around a wasteland.
3447360	3448080	And people would walk up.
3448080	3452800	They didn't have a gallon of water tied around their waist.
3452800	3455200	And you'd run a Geiger counter over it.
3455200	3456160	This is how old...
3456160	3457840	And they'd be like, what's a little fallout
3457840	3459040	between friends, right?
3460160	3460560	I'm sorry.
3460560	3461360	That's thunderdome.
3462000	3464320	Yeah, I was going to say it sounds very post-apocalyptic.
3464320	3465840	This is how old we are.
3465840	3468640	Because remember, when we were growing...
3469280	3472640	Back in the early 90s, this was actually like another thing.
3472640	3476560	Like the cell phone, you knew somebody in a movie was a douche
3476560	3478800	if they pulled out their car keys and went...
3479920	3480800	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3480800	3481760	Yeah, nobody had it.
3481760	3482720	Douchebag!
3482720	3484400	How dare you, Richie Rich?
3485600	3489040	Richie Rich with your remote control car lock.
3489760	3490720	What does that mean?
3491600	3493280	I remember when we got our first cell phones
3493280	3495120	and our phone numbers were one number apart
3495120	3496640	because Rob got them for both of us.
3496720	3497200	Aww.
3498000	3500960	Because we had just become producers on a TV pilot.
3500960	3502000	And we needed our phones.
3502000	3502480	And we kept...
3502480	3504560	And some were the only people that didn't have phones.
3504560	3506960	Uh, uh, Shropp and Harvie, give me your numbers.
3507840	3509360	So, Rob, tell me about when we first...
3511360	3512080	Rob, when you first...
3512080	3513520	Ooh, the lovers package.
3514640	3515680	Got that all the time.
3515680	3517520	Rob, when you first saw Dan, what was...
3518480	3522880	It was, you know, kind of a Wayne's World moment of,
3522880	3524000	you know, star filters.
3524000	3526320	Did you see him on stage first or in person?
3526320	3526800	Probably.
3528480	3530560	I think I remember seeing you.
3530560	3532000	You did stand-up before I did.
3532000	3534080	And you were 18 and I was 21.
3534080	3539040	Rob, what was Dan's point of view at that time as a stand-up?
3540000	3541840	You want to know what his act was like?
3541840	3545120	Yeah, like if you're a very big fan of Jen Kirkman,
3545120	3546880	who talks about not wanting to...
3546880	3548240	Yeah, Jen Kirkman's great.
3548240	3552080	As an example, her point of view is that she doesn't necessarily...
3552080	3553360	Well, she has this buck, so...
3553440	3555040	You get to the Dungeons and Dragons.
3555040	3557360	Just quit looking at me for two seconds.
3559360	3560960	You can feel it in the back of my head.
3560960	3565120	Jen Kirkman is independent and open about her neuroses
3565120	3566320	and not wanting to have children.
3566320	3568320	What was Dan Harmon's point of view at that time?
3569280	3570800	Uh, kind of...
3570800	3573200	I only remember really titles of...
3573200	3576160	I know my closer was a rap about masturbation, right?
3576880	3577840	So nothing has changed.
3577840	3578640	You did it.
3578640	3580880	A good eight minutes of Jeffrey Dahmer jokes.
3580880	3581380	Yeah.
3581940	3583620	Who was eating people at the time.
3584420	3586580	So it was a hot, funny topic, yeah.
3586580	3588900	Yeah, oh, I got a story about that.
3591860	3597140	You had like a bit about like Johnny Carson fucking Ed McMahon in the butt.
3597140	3600180	Yeah, I mean, this isn't gonna make anyone happy.
3600180	3601620	Well, my stand-up was like,
3601620	3605620	oh, what if Batman was taken to shit when the bat signal came up?
3605620	3607540	I'm gonna ask this question of both of you.
3607540	3608420	You both are...
3609140	3610020	What year is this?
3610660	3612660	92?
3612660	3613380	Yeah, yeah.
3613380	3613860	No, no, no.
3613860	3615700	It might have been 91 because I was turning...
3615700	3617060	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3617060	3619140	I was turning...
3619140	3619780	Oh, no, no, no.
3619780	3621700	I was about to turn 92 and I...
3622340	3623460	No, fuck.
3623460	3624180	Okay, it doesn't matter.
3624180	3624500	It doesn't matter.
3624500	3627940	I was about to turn 22 and I wanted to be a stand-up comedian before...
3628740	3630340	While I was 21.
3630340	3631220	Okay, it doesn't matter.
3631220	3635940	So you're both club promoters in 1991.
3635940	3637940	And neither of you are comics,
3637940	3639540	but you're familiar with the other person.
3640260	3642100	You have like one in the newspaper.
3642100	3645700	They're like, look, like Dan Harmon's coming to the chocolate bucket.
3646900	3648740	How do we plug the show?
3648740	3651620	What do you both say as club promoters to promote the other person
3651620	3653780	knowing what you knew about each other at the time?
3653780	3654420	At the time?
3654420	3655460	Come see Dan Harmon.
3655460	3659780	Like, come see Nelly Furtado.
3662740	3663860	Is that your stage name?
3666020	3668740	No, I have this playlist, this 90s playlist.
3669540	3671380	Come see Nelly Furtado.
3671380	3673860	She sings about freedom.
3674820	3677140	And yes, but please don't...
3677140	3678580	You don't have to say what, audience?
3678580	3679140	I can hear you.
3680500	3683300	Just like, how do you describe this?
3683300	3685380	How do you promote the other person?
3686500	3688980	Like, come see Carrot Top.
3689700	3693700	His props will bring you to a grave of laughter.
3696020	3697300	Go easy on them, folks.
3697300	3698420	They're just starting out.
3699700	3701620	Yeah, there was a lot of that.
3701620	3702740	There was a lot of that.
3702740	3705140	No, but I want to know, because I...
3705140	3708100	There's a lot of that, like after, you know,
3708100	3711540	I would do stand-up and then like the guy who was like the MC of the night.
3711540	3712020	Give it up.
3712020	3713300	Comedy's hard, guys.
3713300	3713620	Come on.
3715780	3717060	Come on, this isn't easy, folks.
3717060	3718420	What do you think you can do better?
3718420	3719940	That was Rob Schraub, ladies and gentlemen.
3719940	3720420	All right.
3721220	3722020	Hard business.
3722020	3723860	That's a given because you guys are starting out.
3723860	3725540	And this is something I've asked you about before,
3725540	3726580	and I can't get a straight answer.
3726580	3728420	But like, what were you guys talking about?
3728740	3730100	I was 17 years old.
3730100	3731620	No, I know, I know, I know, I know.
3731620	3736180	But as an exercise, how do you, in a, like, you're a club promoter,
3736180	3737380	what are your three sentences?
3737380	3739140	Come see Rob Schraub, dudes.
3739140	3739540	No, no, no.
3739540	3740340	You're describing...
3740340	3741700	No, you're describing dance.
3741700	3743140	Promote nuance like that, do you?
3743140	3744900	No, Spencer, it's a hypothetical.
3744900	3746420	Like, as if they're not...
3746420	3749700	She's trying to figure out a way for us to answer the question.
3749700	3750900	By the way, there's not Aaron McGathey who says that.
3750900	3753780	Can't hypothetical situations usually exist, though?
3754580	3755620	Well, what?
3755620	3757060	No, because they're hypothetical.
3757060	3757700	Well, they could.
3757780	3759700	Like, in theory, that's why you do it.
3759700	3763220	You don't do, like, hypothetically, what have been eight, you know, eight-ed thing.
3764020	3767780	I mean, don't, don't, there's no need to shut down right now.
3767780	3768980	I think Dan, that's what you're talking about.
3768980	3771220	Do you want this to be grounded or emotionally driven?
3771860	3773700	Do you want it to, do you mean, do you mean, like, because...
3773700	3774980	Is there a difference?
3774980	3777300	In the grounded version, it would just be the literal...
3777300	3778980	No, I do not want it to be grounded.
3778980	3781700	I want to know what kind of comedy you were doing at the time.
3781700	3782580	Oh, okay, Rob was doing...
3782580	3786660	Like, as if, like, at that moment, but I want you to present it as club promoter.
3786980	3788580	It's not a crazy thing.
3788580	3790180	You don't have to be defensive about it.
3790180	3793380	Well, I'm being defensive towards Spencer,
3793380	3796500	who last week said that we were in different generations.
3797700	3798420	Yeah, you are.
3800180	3800820	Yeah.
3800820	3801940	By five years.
3802820	3803460	All right, anyway.
3805380	3806100	All right.
3806100	3807540	We're getting bogged down in stuff that...
3807540	3814660	We are, I just, I'm so sorry that now I'm committing to this, but I, but I'd really like to know.
3814980	3819860	If I may, if I may, I think you're not asking for, like, a performance-driven thing.
3819860	3821940	You just want to know what it was like.
3821940	3824100	Like, give us the experience, right?
3824100	3827780	I assume that you guys were starting out, so I don't need to know that, like,
3828340	3829940	it was amateur or whatever.
3829940	3832180	I just want to know what your point of view at the time was.
3832180	3834660	I just found out that Dan was making jokes about Jeffrey Dahmer,
3834660	3835620	which is really interesting.
3835620	3838020	I'm just curious how you would plug the other person,
3838740	3840100	if they were the hypothetical...
3840100	3840660	Here's the thing.
3840660	3842900	...the famous comic.
3842900	3844340	How do you plug that person?
3844580	3844980	Right, right.
3844980	3850500	I think this is, this is, I fell in love with Dan Zach before I fell in love with him,
3850500	3855220	because he would do what I liked was talking about pop culture,
3855220	3857860	and I was obsessed and still am with, like, pop culture and...
3857860	3860900	So what was your, so as a club promoter, what would you say?
3860900	3863380	Oh, come see Dan Harmon.
3864260	3865620	They can't hear, this is a newspaper.
3865620	3874580	I don't know...
3874580	3875700	I think it's 9-11 again.
3878260	3879220	But not on the clock.
3883940	3886740	This is a rubble and corpse-based observation.
3886740	3900660	Dan Harmon's witty observational humor about oversized women doing in the elevator at college.
3901380	3902020	Remember that?
3902020	3902900	Yeah, yeah.
3902900	3903220	Okay.
3905140	3913700	See his impressive impressions of Ed McMahon having sex with Johnny Carson.
3913700	3914740	Can you believe it?
3914820	3916580	Would you be, could you imagine?
3920260	3924100	Those are like the, the, the kind of zaps that are happening next...
3924100	3925300	Perfect.
3925300	3928260	Okay, but I, but I, but I, I, like, like,
3928260	3930180	Do yours for Shrobs, really good.
3930180	3932580	Just do your, I don't want to do the club promoter thing.
3932580	3935940	I just want to tell you my favorite, like, like, Shrobs stand-up thing that, like...
3935940	3939220	Would you humor me and just do the club promoter thing before you explain the Shrobs thing?
3939220	3945940	Shrobs, uh, uh, uh, come, come see a guy who looks like a young version of Michael Stipe, uh,
3945940	3947940	doing, uh, pussy and Batman jokes.
3947940	3948740	Okay, thank you.
3948740	3949240	Okay.
3952020	3954660	So, but Rob, Rob?
3954660	3955780	Did I do pussy jokes?
3955780	3956660	What did you do?
3956660	3958020	I'm just, I'm blowing through it, man.
3958020	3959700	No, you're right, you're right, you're right.
3959700	3962180	I probably did a lot of pussy jokes.
3962180	3966900	Rob's, Rob's opening thing was that you would say, um, there's, uh,
3966980	3971460	he would say, like, there's, uh, there's, he would do an impression of, uh,
3971460	3974260	shit, I don't know how you would tee it up, and he would go, like, uh,
3975300	3984180	what if, what if, uh, what if Tonto from, uh, Lone Ranger and McCoy from Star Trek
3984820	3987380	both ended up on a planet full of dead people?
3988260	3992740	And he'd be like, it would be Tonto going, him dead, Kimo Sabe.
3993540	3994500	He's dead, Jim.
3995140	3998260	Him, him, him, him dead, Kimo Sabe.
3998260	3999700	He's dead, Jim.
3999700	4002100	And then, and then the punch side was Rob saying,
4003460	4007060	and then there's a split screen and it's just the two of them and they're like,
4007060	4007940	him dead, Jim.
4009140	4009940	Kimo Sabe?
4011220	4013220	He's dead, Jim?
4013220	4015940	And then, and then they were both crying because they,
4015940	4019300	because they missed the Lone Ranger and, uh, and Jim.
4019300	4020820	I forgot about the split screen.
4020820	4021300	Yeah.
4021300	4023220	The split screen is the funny part because it was,
4023380	4025220	it was stand up that had a split screen.
4025940	4027700	That's what, I was like, I love this guy.
4027700	4028180	Yeah.
4028180	4030100	His stand up has a split screen in it.
4030100	4033300	What was the, uh, fat women in the elevator joke?
4033300	4038340	Just a horrible, horrible Asperger child trying to, thinking that,
4038340	4041860	that, that the reason people, not everyone did Andrew Day's Clay's act
4041860	4043540	is because they were afraid to do it.
4043540	4045620	Like, I, I did not understand comedy.
4045620	4046820	I was a terrible stand up.
4046820	4047940	It was terrible material.
4047940	4050420	Everyone here respects you a whole lot and knows that you're great.
4050420	4052820	I, I, I accept that, but, but, but the,
4053060	4057220	Dan would say, you know, I go to Marquette, Marquette, was it Marquette?
4057220	4059700	Did you kind of went to and then left?
4059700	4060100	Yes.
4060100	4060340	Okay.
4060340	4063220	So you go to Marquette and you're in the dorm and, and you go,
4063220	4064180	and I'm sitting there.
4065220	4065700	Okay.
4067300	4069380	No, I don't because I'm embarrassed about it.
4069380	4070420	It's embarrassing.
4070420	4072980	I'm embarrassed to see it because we see, okay.
4072980	4075380	I'm going to say instead of cunt C word.
4077620	4080980	Because I thought that was acceptable to say.
4080980	4082500	That's how out of touch I was.
4083220	4090260	Even back in 91, the whole room went, ah, you don't, you don't say the C word in your
4090260	4090980	standup act.
4090980	4093700	Like just stop saying that word.
4093700	4094740	It's the word.
4094740	4099700	No, it was like, I would, you know, I go to Marquette and I'm going to the dorm
4099700	4106020	and, uh, you know, and I get in the elevator and I press one and there's these fat C words
4106020	4111460	that are there and they say, couldn't you take the stairs?
4111540	4112500	And I go, okay.
4112500	4116580	I'll get off on a two, three, four, five, six, and seven and take the stairs.
4118260	4119300	I was terrible.
4119300	4121220	It was awful, awful.
4121220	4123300	You know, it got, no, it didn't.
4123300	4124020	No one laughed.
4124020	4125300	Everyone was sad for me.
4126340	4126900	Okay.
4126900	4130740	They can see for my acne that I was young enough that it was weird that I was there.
4130740	4132980	So it was like, yay, 17, 18.
4134020	4137300	I was not 18 and he was not 17.
4137380	4143540	I was 21 and he was 18 and I actually got him in trouble because the woman that I was
4143540	4151540	dating was the girl that I was dating that was absolutely dating five other guys at the
4151540	4158020	same time, uh, was, uh, uh, she was a waitress at the bar and we were living together at
4158020	4161860	the time when she was not having sex with everybody else in the world.
4162260	4164580	Uh, and I'm rolling over.
4165860	4168820	You know, Dan's funny, right?
4169460	4170340	Yeah, whatever.
4171620	4175300	You know, he's only 18 and he's just, he's so much funnier than me.
4175300	4176740	I just don't understand it.
4176740	4177300	What?
4177300	4178180	He's 18.
4178180	4179700	I've been serving him drinks.
4180420	4180900	Shit.
4180900	4184900	And I, Dan kicked out of the bar.
4184900	4186500	Ended my burgeoning standup.
4186500	4186980	Correct.
4188020	4188980	About fat cuts.
4188980	4197380	That was our first, that was our first, I was playing Matrix and I was worried because
4197380	4203940	I was about to do, uh, uh, my first standup open mic and, uh, somebody told Dan, I said,
4203940	4204980	Hey, Rob's nervous.
4204980	4211220	And you go, you came over and, and you said, Hey brother, don't worry about it.
4211220	4212100	It's going to be fine.
4213140	4217220	And walked away and I felt like, you know, it is going to be fine.
4218180	4221380	With this woman, was it a secret that she was dating other people or how do you kind
4221380	4223540	of like signed up to everybody?
4224660	4227140	To me it was, but everybody else was fucking her.
4227140	4227380	Yeah.
4228500	4230500	Oh, you, you didn't know that she was going out.
4230500	4231540	Eventually I did.
4231540	4234420	After I found out she was having sex with everyone.
4234420	4234660	Yes.
4236580	4237860	Come on out, Tammy.
4240180	4241380	She's full of holes.
4245620	4246260	Come on guys.
4247300	4249220	I'm not, I'm not, I should.
4249220	4252820	Crazy sociopath, awful person.
4252820	4253300	Terrible.
4254180	4254740	I gotcha.
4254740	4257940	What was the, there must have been a moment between the two of you that was like your
4257940	4261220	big bonding moment where you're like sitting at the edge of a dock, throwing rocks into
4261220	4261700	a river.
4261700	4265940	Like, what was your like, what was your, what was your, what was your thing?
4265940	4269460	Like, what was the moment that solidified your friendship?
4269460	4271140	I think it was a slow burn.
4271140	4274340	You know, I think we, we were always like,
4275220	4280820	Well, it was that, it was that party, the comedy sports party where, uh, like, uh, like,
4280820	4284580	like somebody was, somebody took me aside and gave me the don't get cocky speech.
4284580	4287700	Uh, local impromptu of like an old time.
4287700	4292500	It's a good, good thing to do for a 32 year old man to say to an 18 year old, hey,
4292500	4293780	watch, watch yourself.
4293780	4294580	You're doing great.
4294580	4296500	Just don't do, just don't make the mistake.
4296500	4299380	All the other greats don't get cocky.
4299380	4302420	You think you're going to win the Wisconsin cheese comic competition.
4302420	4303540	You're not good enough for that.
4303540	4303860	Yeah.
4303940	4307140	And then, and then, and then I was like, man, I was, I was, it kind of ruined my,
4307140	4310820	my evening and I was driving home with Rob and I was like, man, I'm pumped out.
4310820	4311620	And he's like, why?
4311620	4320980	I was like, Hey, so-and-so took me aside to the pickle pantry and told me not to get cocky.
4321540	4323060	And Rob's like, what the fuck?
4323060	4328420	I just, I just got told by so-and-so not to get cocky at the other party, man.
4329380	4330580	And I was like, what the fuck?
4330580	4332100	Wait, this is a conspiracy.
4332820	4334020	They were, we're not cocky.
4334020	4335620	They just don't want us to get cocky.
4335620	4336260	Like, wait, what?
4337060	4337780	All right.
4337780	4339940	And I said, let's make a pact.
4339940	4342020	If you get cocky, I'll tell you.
4342020	4342580	I'll know.
4343220	4345060	If I get cocky, you tell me.
4345060	4347060	And until then, let's get fucking cocky.
4347940	4352100	Which leads us to this intervention that we all-
4352100	4353700	Which leads us to this great show.
4354980	4356180	Dan, you're getting cocky.
4356180	4357380	Oh, shit.
4357380	4358020	God damn it.
4358020	4362420	I'm going to throw a dispenser.
4363700	4365780	Well, Brady Street, please come out here.
4365780	4367220	We're going to talk to you.
4367220	4367620	Okay.
4367620	4368740	You want to edit that?
4368740	4369060	All right.
4369060	4369460	Come on.
4369460	4371620	Let's, let's shit, man.
4371620	4372100	Fucked up.
4372100	4373140	Yes, yes.
4373140	4374340	Dungeons and Dragons.
4374340	4374900	No, I mean, I-
4374900	4375700	Sorry.
4375700	4376420	Oh, really?
4376420	4380180	I like talking about your, I like talking about your friendship.
4380180	4384340	I really, I, everyone should really look up to this friendship.
4384340	4387540	They've worked together and created so many things together and been friends for so long.
4387620	4389140	And that's really wonderful.
4391700	4393220	Dan performed Rob's wedding.
4394100	4394980	That's true.
4394980	4396660	Dan, Dan married me.
4397380	4401140	Finally, after all these years of me wanting you to marry me,
4401140	4403940	you finally married me to my wife.
4405940	4407620	How many friendships is somebody going to look up to?
4408820	4409300	What?
4409300	4410740	You're going to take that away from me?
4410740	4412740	Not to.
4412740	4415700	It's a sweet moment and you went, I think that's bullshit.
4415700	4416500	What?
4416580	4416900	I don't know.
4416900	4420900	I mean, maybe this was tainted by me being a navy kid who moved around a lot.
4420900	4423380	And you're looking fucking weird tonight.
4423380	4424580	I'm so sorry.
4424580	4429220	Look, like the, the shoulders are what are bothering me.
4429220	4431220	This is Dan's Emmy jacket.
4431220	4432660	No, this is a different jacket.
4432660	4434980	That's Zachary Lee's jacket.
4434980	4436580	Do you guys see the way that I tie this tie?
4438020	4439540	No, it's a podcast.
4442500	4442980	All right.
4442980	4445780	I mean, you need some fucking tombstones.
4446980	4448260	Where's our characters?
4448260	4448820	I don't know.
4450980	4451700	Are we good?
4452340	4453780	Yeah, do it.
4453780	4454260	Okay.
4455700	4460740	Last time our heroes had found themselves in a room full of stone lions and chains.
4461380	4464420	Sharpie climbed one and made everything rumble for a while
4464420	4467300	and everyone fruck out and climbed on top of the lions.
4468180	4470900	Lava poured out of the mouth of the light lions.
4471620	4473540	Of the lions covered the hot.
4473540	4477540	This is, I'm, you were in a fucking room.
4477540	4478500	Lava showed up.
4480340	4482980	He climbed on some of the top of some statues.
4483940	4485620	And then you heard Admiral Darkstar.
4485620	4493060	He's like, and then Robo breathy showed up and he was like, I'm Robo breathy.
4493700	4494500	That's what happened.
4496660	4501460	We're going to have to bring the lights way up because I can't see shit.
4503540	4504260	Bring my glasses.
4504260	4506180	And that's not like all the year.
4506180	4506900	Sucks.
4506900	4507780	Anybody else?
4507780	4508580	Everybody.
4512100	4512420	All right.
4512420	4514100	I don't want to, I don't want to derail this.
4514100	4514420	Wait a minute.
4514420	4514980	Wait a minute.
4514980	4516740	I'm Kumail and Jeff.
4517780	4519460	No, that's not, that shouldn't be.
4519460	4520500	I'm just Kumail.
4520500	4520980	Yeah.
4520980	4521540	What happened?
4522100	4522660	I'm Jeff.
4523300	4523860	Okay.
4523860	4524420	I love it.
4524420	4525940	Do you have, is there something wrong?
4525940	4526660	When you started?
4526660	4527460	No, I was Jeff.
4528900	4529780	Last time I was here.
4529780	4530740	Now I'm Kumail.
4530740	4531060	All right.
4532020	4532740	Okay.
4533300	4535700	I think heroin's doing the heavy lifting.
4540740	4544100	I think heroin's doing the heavy lifting.
4544100	4544500	What is that?
4544500	4545220	I don't know what that is.
4545220	4546980	That's Kumail's stand up image.
4546980	4549460	He's a friend of yours and you don't ever listen to his stuff.
4549460	4550180	I'm busy.
4550900	4551380	I don't know.
4552260	4552980	You're busy.
4552980	4553700	You're busy.
4553700	4554420	I asked you.
4554420	4556100	He's coming a year.
4556100	4557780	He's going to be in next week's episode.
4558580	4560900	He's going to be in a scene with Nathan Fillion.
4563460	4567780	I'm glad you saved that before my episode,
4567780	4569300	which is the following week.
4569300	4569780	Applaud.
4571860	4574260	Strav's directing a couple of community episodes.
4574260	4574580	All right.
4574580	4580980	Well, we need a young lady or an old lady in the audience that
4586180	4589700	I sometimes say, well, anybody that feels like they deserve to
4590500	4593860	or would be healed by participating by playing.
4596100	4597460	We've got a hand up in the front row.
4599220	4600420	What is your name, young lady?
4603780	4604900	What's your name, my friend?
4604900	4606820	Why do you want this so bad?
4607460	4608180	I don't know.
4608180	4610180	Everyone was pointing at me in the front row.
4610180	4610740	What is your name?
4610740	4613380	You look like a prettier version of Alanis Morissette.
4613380	4615780	Oh, I'm going as Alanis Morissette for Halloween, actually.
4615780	4616820	Oh, nice.
4616820	4617540	Which version?
4617540	4618820	Her thank you video.
4618900	4619780	Wow, naked.
4620420	4622580	Yeah, I have like tanned tights,
4622580	4625540	and then I bought hair extensions that are going to be really long.
4626420	4629300	Did you just put that jacket on or you've been wearing this this whole time?
4632500	4633860	My name is Leah.
4633860	4634340	Yeah.
4634900	4635220	All right.
4635220	4635860	Thank you, Leah.
4636660	4637140	All right.
4637140	4637700	Organa.
4641060	4641620	Nerd Mel.
4646660	4648020	You wanted to come up here.
4648820	4652340	Yeah, kind of.
4654900	4655220	All right.
4655220	4655940	All right.
4655940	4658820	Do you know what you're looking at?
4658820	4660660	See, no, I think there's some screw ups here.
4661460	4661780	Is that?
4661780	4662260	Oh, okay.
4662260	4662740	No, that's good.
4662740	4663220	That's good.
4663220	4664180	You're good.
4665620	4668260	It's a sheet of paper filled with things that no one understands,
4669700	4671380	and your name is Mulrain.
4672100	4672740	You're sort of...
4673780	4675060	A magical, nice...
4675860	4681540	You have a lot of integrity, but also, you know,
4682820	4684500	maybe you're sometimes not very logical.
4685060	4687540	You're a very optimistic person.
4687540	4690900	You do have a box of crafts and tools.
4691540	4693220	I know that I like putting on shows.
4694100	4695780	Yeah, all right.
4696340	4696820	True.
4698100	4700900	This is what I got to do to read this now.
4700900	4702020	Look at what I'm doing.
4702020	4703700	He's holding it out very far.
4704420	4706020	We're old and our bodies are dying.
4706020	4706420	God damn it.
4707940	4708340	All right.
4708340	4709380	My birthday's next month.
4709380	4710100	Don't forget, Dan.
4711540	4714500	Start, start, start, start, you know, good skimming.
4714500	4715460	Skimming Amazon.
4716900	4717540	Hey, hey, whoa.
4719060	4720420	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
4720420	4723140	Yeah, we do Wesley Snipes on my birthday.
4725300	4727620	That's actually a good idea, Wesley Snipes.
4727620	4730740	Wesley Snipes day two.
4731540	4734580	Yeah, I like Eddie Murphy.
4737060	4740660	All right, so where are we?
4742260	4744660	I already told you guys where you are.
4744660	4745300	But I'm Jeff.
4745860	4746420	That's cool.
4748100	4750100	Did we escape the lava?
4750100	4752980	Okay, so currently you guys are sitting on statues
4752980	4754740	that are kind of islands in this lava.
4755380	4756420	Is there a roof?
4757220	4759300	The roof, as it happens, can't be seen.
4759620	4760180	He's on fire.
4761620	4762340	Not quite.
4762340	4763460	Okay, it will be though.
4763460	4764580	It's full of chains.
4764580	4765780	It's full of these chains.
4765780	4768820	It's like a jungle gym of chains.
4768820	4770420	Right, and Breffy came crawling down.
4770420	4774500	Yeah, so he's in these chains above you, above your heads.
4774500	4777460	Question, are we in the middle of the room
4777460	4779940	or are we off to the side of the room?
4779940	4783780	Are we like, like, like one fourth of the way?
4783780	4786900	Yeah, you're about a quarter into the room from the walls.
4786900	4788100	Ah, I get it.
4788100	4794100	Is there an opening on, like, if I, like Donkey Kong Jr.
4794100	4800820	swung from the chains over to, is there a place for me to go?
4800820	4802820	Is there a point A and B in this?
4802820	4805620	You can kind of jump amongst these chain,
4805620	4808180	like, tangle of chains, but that's all you can manage.
4808180	4809220	But there's no way out.
4810100	4813060	The only way that was the way in was a door
4813060	4814340	and that's covered in lava.
4814340	4817940	Are there any free floating bunches of bananas or oranges?
4819060	4820900	That might be of value.
4821860	4825860	No, just chains on the walls, hanging from the ceiling.
4825860	4827300	And we were on top of these stone lions
4827300	4829380	when Breffy came down, I have at least.
4829380	4831300	Okay, so Breffy's down and he's mad.
4832020	4833620	Well, I mean, you don't know its emotions.
4833620	4836820	I'm about to find out because they call me,
4836820	4839060	in this game, the great communicator.
4839060	4848340	Breffy, it's me, Sharpie, of the famous Dirty Fords.
4852260	4852900	Oh, okay.
4853860	4858180	I imagine you're angry with us for destroying your brethren
4859140	4862020	and then murdering you while Jeff fucked you.
4862740	4872420	If I'm getting that right, it was a weird night
4872420	4875220	and I think that's how it ended.
4875860	4879940	I tie the yarn that I have around my head like a bow
4879940	4883220	so I seem less intimidating.
4883220	4884820	You seem less intimidating.
4886340	4889220	But we have been through a lot since then, as have you.
4890180	4894900	And we only ever feel remorse
4894900	4896900	when we talk about what happened that night.
4898900	4902260	And we feel, although we're biased, that that's enough.
4902260	4902740	Destroy.
4906660	4907780	You didn't let me finish.
4907780	4908660	Destroy.
4910180	4911460	Okay, if you're going to be rude,
4912660	4914820	you're going to start to put me in a social corner.
4916580	4918660	I think we need to start yanking on these chains.
4918740	4921460	I think we got to start pulling and yanking on chain.
4921460	4922260	Everybody grab it.
4922260	4926980	Even the women just drag, yank on these chains.
4926980	4929860	As hard as we can, we might open up a trap door
4929860	4933460	that's inverted and sneak out or a thing
4933460	4935940	or just start yanking on the closest chain.
4935940	4936980	Everybody got it.
4936980	4937780	I got two.
4939380	4942900	So you got a close chain that you can yank on?
4942900	4945140	Because maybe, I mean, they've got to exist for some reason.
4945140	4947220	So yank on a chain.
4947220	4949540	Somebody, anyone, come on.
4950660	4954500	All right, the both of us are yanking on some chains.
4954500	4957220	I don't see any chain yanking on your end of the line.
4957220	4958980	I want to cast mage armor.
4958980	4961540	Okay. And yank on a chain.
4961540	4962020	Thank you.
4965460	4966900	How are we doing over there, Quark?
4966900	4969780	You want to yank on a chain or are you two awesome?
4971940	4973380	No, I am certainly not too awesome.
4973380	4977140	I will, I'm going to, really quick,
4977140	4978340	and this is outside of the game.
4978340	4981220	One of my special abilities says illiterate?
4981220	4981720	Yeah.
4986020	4988420	It's a condition affecting millions of Americans.
4993620	4995700	You framed it as a special ability for...
4997300	4998580	The country's gotten that bad.
4998580	4999700	Hey man, I don't know what it does.
4999700	5001060	It just decided to...
5001060	5002100	I just fall in my heart.
5002100	5002740	I don't know what that sign says.
5003540	5006420	There's no handicap section on the character sheet,
5006420	5007700	so you have to put it somewhere.
5007700	5009540	One of my special abilities says...
5009540	5010980	Whoa, whoa, whoa, guest star, come on.
5010980	5014020	One of my special abilities says Coco, exclamation point.
5014500	5015000	Yeah.
5016100	5017700	That is a horse on your soulmate.
5017700	5018200	Yeah.
5019620	5021300	Get your horse to yank on a chain.
5021300	5021860	Also not a skeleton.
5023860	5025460	With his mouth.
5025460	5026420	Coco's not here.
5026420	5030340	I yank on a chain.
5030340	5031940	You're all yanking on chains.
5031940	5032440	Yeah.
5034260	5034820	And Coco.
5034820	5037220	They're just tangled up and bolted to the walls,
5037220	5040340	so it's like doing nothing pretty much.
5040340	5042660	All right, I jump down and I punch...
5042660	5044500	You jump down into the lava?
5045220	5046740	No, I don't jump down into lava.
5046740	5048340	Then where do you jump down to?
5048340	5050260	To the top of one of the statues.
5050260	5051780	You're on the statues.
5051780	5052280	You're on it.
5054980	5057140	All right, how far away is Broughy?
5057140	5057780	Where is he?
5057780	5059060	He's up in this chain.
5059060	5061060	He's about 30 feet off ahead of you.
5061060	5062740	He's kind of in the middle of him.
5062740	5063220	Yanking.
5063220	5065540	Okay, I use my climbing ability.
5066580	5071300	I tie one of my knives to my head with my yarn.
5071300	5071860	Okay.
5071860	5074900	And I go up to him like a noir wall,
5075700	5077620	and I stab him in the face.
5079620	5080120	What?
5083460	5088420	Gary Gyjax just cried out in the audience.
5088900	5091780	He rolled over in his dice.
5092340	5095140	Yeah, so leaping into the chains.
5095140	5097540	Try to remember that I have the skill of illiteracy.
5098180	5100260	Yeah, barbarians can't read.
5100260	5101060	It's not a joke.
5103060	5104340	They didn't learn how to read.
5105700	5107620	Number one special ability is...
5107620	5109620	They were too busy murdering people.
5109620	5110740	You should also put a height.
5111780	5113540	And literate's a real rule,
5113540	5114580	and so you have to...
5114580	5116260	Like, if you're like, I read a sign.
5116260	5116740	No, you don't.
5116740	5117620	You're illiterate.
5117700	5118660	It's important to...
5118660	5119380	Like, height is...
5119380	5120100	No, I understand.
5120100	5121220	Also, height's on there.
5123140	5128900	I think our point is that if this game were modern,
5129860	5131780	it would have special disabilities on it.
5133700	5135300	Okay, so I'm noir walling.
5137220	5140100	Can you edit out the eight-minute pause before my lame...
5141300	5145780	Make it seem like that gem came right out of my fucking idiot brain?
5145780	5147060	It's your show, man.
5147620	5148980	I'm a barbarian.
5148980	5153780	I go in a barbarian mini rage, and I noir wall roughy.
5153780	5157300	Okay, so rules-wise, is that a real rage or not a real rage?
5157300	5158260	It's a real rage.
5158260	5162740	Okay, so leaping into a rage, you climb through these things,
5162740	5165860	and you get so crazy, you don't even know what you're doing.
5165860	5168260	You're just head-buttoning a guy with a dagger in your face.
5170100	5174340	It doesn't do any damage because that's not how daggers should be used.
5177060	5186740	Because the universe says, oh, this was the wrong use for the dagger,
5186740	5188020	so gravity pulls it down.
5188020	5188500	What do you mean?
5188500	5192260	No, how it works is if you were a trained warrior, for instance,
5192260	5193620	who knew how to use a dagger,
5195700	5199060	you would be a lot less accurate with hitting something
5199060	5200820	if it were instead tied to your head.
5202580	5205300	Because you're used to using with your arms.
5205300	5206660	Everyone knows where their head is.
5207060	5210340	Yeah, but it's not a warrior technique.
5210340	5212900	It's just flailing around.
5212900	5213860	Well, fine.
5213860	5214740	Question.
5214740	5215780	It's not as effective.
5215780	5217140	So, I mean, I rolled it.
5217140	5221940	Can we do a kickstarter to start to fund a pilot that's just Spencer and Aaron driving?
5224100	5230420	And her just asking questions about Dungeons and Dragons.
5230420	5231700	What was your question, Ron?
5231700	5234100	How long is my ribbon rope?
5234100	5236100	It only goes about 15 feet.
5236100	5237620	Don't try to use it creatively.
5239140	5240820	Just don't try to tie it to your body.
5242820	5244820	People tie things to their bodies all the time.
5244820	5245780	They really don't.
5246740	5247140	Okay.
5248020	5251460	Okay, so I'm thinking about doing something with a ribbon rope,
5251460	5255940	but it depends on how the lava is rising, right?
5255940	5256820	Slowly.
5256820	5257140	Okay.
5258980	5260260	Preppy is where?
5260260	5262500	He's up above you in this web.
5262500	5263300	You're trying to save us.
5263300	5264020	Of chains.
5266340	5271860	I'm not complaining about this because I like it, but you seem angry tonight.
5271860	5272740	It's cool.
5272740	5278340	Spencer, is everyone kind of freaked out by me stabbing around with my head?
5278340	5282340	Like, do I gain some sort of intimidation points by acting like a lunatic?
5282340	5286660	No, he says this is a guy who doesn't know how to use the weapons I see on his, you know, body.
5287700	5288740	Fair enough.
5288740	5289860	He's got a flaming sword.
5289860	5290740	He ties a dagger to his head.
5290740	5292260	Where am I in this?
5292260	5293220	Where am I?
5297300	5299940	Hey, am I on the same line?
5303780	5305140	Am I on the same line?
5307380	5308500	You're on separate lines.
5308500	5308820	Okay.
5308820	5309620	Well, okay.
5309620	5313940	I'm going to start like shouting really loud in a high pitched voice.
5313940	5314420	Okay.
5314420	5318420	Like, hey, knock it off over there.
5320660	5321460	Bigger fish.
5322580	5322900	Nice.
5323940	5326100	Lava's getting larger, right?
5327140	5327620	Right.
5327620	5328100	Yeah.
5329300	5331780	So we got to find a way out.
5332580	5340500	I say we give the pulling on the chains one more try and then we'll think of something else
5340500	5346820	because maybe we could commit to it a little bit more and not think it's a stupid idea.
5346820	5349700	I think the attitude had a lot to do with it not working.
5349940	5355300	I saw a lot of eye rolling while they were pulling on chains, you know.
5355300	5356660	Do I fit in my backpack?
5361780	5362420	I'm a halfling.
5362420	5363540	Do I fit in my backpack?
5363540	5363700	Yeah.
5363700	5365060	No, that's a fine question.
5365620	5367860	Halflings have like halfling size backpacks.
5367860	5371220	So unless it was like a handy Haver sack, for instance.
5371220	5372980	She could fit in one of our backpacks.
5372980	5374580	She could fit in one normal size backpack.
5374580	5376020	Lorraine, can I have your backpack?
5376020	5376900	Or a bag of holding.
5377220	5381060	Okay, when do I get another turn?
5381060	5384260	I don't care, someone do something.
5384260	5387540	I'm not going to do anything until it's, you know, my guy's turn.
5387540	5389060	You don't have to be pouty.
5390340	5390980	I do.
5390980	5392260	You control the universe.
5392260	5394340	If you pout, the sun melts.
5394340	5396500	Why don't you roll initiative?
5396500	5399300	Roll some initiative and then we can figure this out.
5400260	5400900	There you go.
5404660	5406100	Dan, you go first.
5406180	5406740	All right.
5406740	5408020	Here's what I would like to do.
5410100	5411780	That's why you roll initiative.
5411780	5413460	So this shit doesn't happen.
5414500	5416660	So we can all stay friends by the end of this.
5416660	5419460	We got Jeff Davis's party to go to afterwards.
5419460	5420420	It's a good point, Rob.
5420420	5422660	I should roll initiative to keep things on track.
5422660	5423060	Right.
5423060	5423940	That is true.
5423940	5424420	Yeah.
5424420	5425060	Okay.
5425060	5431540	Teleport cape onto this fucking arachnid assholes back.
5431540	5433300	Can I teleport onto his back?
5433300	5434900	You can definitely try.
5434900	5435620	All right.
5435620	5436820	What's he doing on my back?
5438020	5439140	Oh, never asshole.
5439140	5440980	You teleport onto his back.
5440980	5441700	You're up on it.
5446180	5449700	You can see the back of his head and it's all covered in metal plates.
5450820	5451380	Yeah.
5451380	5454660	I take my Norwell dagger and I shamefully pull it off my head.
5456500	5460020	I put it in my pocket and I try to read something and can't.
5460020	5466420	What do you guys think of this drawing?
5467220	5468180	Is this waves?
5470180	5472100	What does my sun rod do?
5472100	5472980	It's like a torch.
5473940	5474900	What did you say?
5474900	5475460	Sheds light.
5476740	5477140	What?
5477140	5477860	Sheds light.
5477860	5478500	Oh, it sheds light.
5481140	5482340	Like the sun in a rod.
5484740	5485700	Yeah, you will.
5485700	5486660	We're not fighting anything.
5486660	5487140	We're just trying to-
5487140	5487620	No.
5487620	5489140	Well, I mean, technically you are.
5489140	5489700	We're fighting-
5489700	5491140	Speaking of which, I'm just going to go.
5491140	5493460	Um, he shoots chains at all of you guys.
5494340	5494980	Pull on him.
5496900	5498500	Everybody pull on the chain.
5500500	5500740	Just-
5501300	5501700	All right.
5502340	5503300	Kumail gets hit.
5504420	5505380	He's not here.
5505380	5506740	Christoper gets hit.
5506740	5507460	Okay.
5507460	5508020	Ow.
5508020	5509540	Is there a hook on the end of the chain?
5509540	5509780	Yeah.
5509780	5513860	It stabs into your chest and you feel it kind of grinding around inside your body.
5513860	5515380	I've been hell raisored.
5515380	5515540	Yeah.
5516500	5517060	You have.
5517060	5517220	Yeah.
5517220	5518180	You take eight damage.
5518820	5520180	I have a spell.
5520180	5521220	We're keeping track of that.
5521220	5522260	I don't get a pencil.
5522260	5523220	Oh, I am.
5523220	5524660	Laureen's got a spell.
5524660	5526900	I have a spell called entangle.
5526900	5527220	Yeah.
5527220	5528340	That sounds promising.
5528900	5529140	Okay.
5531300	5532500	Casting entangle.
5533620	5534820	You try and entangle.
5537460	5540500	You kind of try and entangle, but entangling doesn't happen.
5541540	5543940	You see the chains, they start to like shake a little bit,
5543940	5545540	like they might move, but then they don't.
5546180	5546980	It's okay, Laureen.
5546980	5547220	It's okay.
5547220	5547620	Sorry.
5548340	5549220	Sorry, everybody.
5549860	5551620	Just let me know when it's my turn, man.
5551620	5552180	You can go.
5552820	5553620	I don't want to warn.
5553620	5554420	I don't want to.
5554420	5555700	No, it's Aaron's turn again.
5555700	5561460	I don't want to alarm anybody, but I kind of start starting to have to go to the bathroom.
5564580	5565700	I'm just like saying.
5565700	5567300	Well, just don't be a hero tonight.
5569940	5573060	I'm just saying it's my life and we're gonna live it.
5574660	5575220	Okay.
5575220	5580740	If it's my turn again, because Laureen and I traded backpacks and where I have the human
5580740	5588260	backpack, I spit on the backpack and I wrap my cloak of resistance around the backpack.
5588260	5595860	I poke two holes through the bottom and the sides and I'm realizing I don't need the backpack.
5595860	5598500	I wear the cloak of resistance.
5602260	5603220	I have a wrap around me.
5603620	5617300	With my flaming sword, I rush breathy with the enthusiasm of somebody who doesn't know
5617300	5620180	about the world, i.e. someone who can't read.
5621060	5621700	I run.
5621700	5622900	I run at him.
5622900	5625700	Use your far sword thing.
5625700	5627300	I use my far sword thing.
5628340	5629380	Yeah, okay.
5629380	5630580	Well, Spencer.
5630580	5631220	Hey, it's fine.
5632100	5636100	It's just that you were already really close to him because you wanted to headbutt him.
5636100	5640020	Okay, well, when I say run, I mean, I guess just take a step.
5640020	5640420	I'm sorry.
5641300	5647380	I use my flaming sword and before I stab him, I look in his eyes and I say,
5647380	5650100	think about your most vulnerable time.
5651860	5653620	Have you ever peed in your pants?
5654500	5656420	Have you ever pooped in your pants?
5657300	5660660	And maybe breathy like kind of thinks back and that's when I
5660660	5665060	stab him between his eyes and I open my mouth so I can drink his blood.
5667940	5672020	So, saying those words and clinging to the chains,
5672020	5676740	you stab at him with your flaming sword during his moment of introspection.
5679220	5680740	But you miss, apparently.
5680740	5685460	It's pretty hard to cling to chains while you're swiping with the sword, I guess.
5685460	5686740	So, he doesn't.
5686740	5689860	It turns out the most vulnerable moment was when you were raping him.
5693700	5694500	Just so you know.
5694500	5697620	Yeah, DVD special features.
5699620	5705060	So, because I don't hate him, do I just fall away like a trapeze?
5705060	5707060	No, because you hold on to these chains.
5707060	5708020	You're like, close.
5708020	5709460	So, I just kind of like hang out there.
5709460	5710900	I'm like, ugh, embarrassing.
5712580	5713060	Like that.
5713860	5715940	For the podcast listeners, like, flailed.
5717540	5720740	So, because I raped him, does that mean that, ugh, god.
5720740	5721780	No, it's unrelated.
5721780	5723220	You just want him to think about that.
5723220	5724340	That's what he thought of.
5724340	5726980	Right, but I mean, like, is he more resistant to me?
5726980	5728500	Do you roll an emotional check?
5728500	5730580	No, I just rolled a two.
5732420	5733380	It happens.
5733380	5734340	Putting it at Sharpie's chair.
5734340	5736260	Well, I just meant because, like, we have a history.
5736260	5737540	Like, I didn't know if he was like...
5738180	5738580	Right.
5738580	5740980	Well, that's why I thought you were trying to make him think of stuff.
5741780	5742740	Because of your history.
5744020	5746420	Just tell me when it's my turn.
5746420	5747860	I just told you it was your turn.
5747860	5748260	Is it?
5748260	5748820	Did you?
5748820	5749060	Yeah.
5749060	5751540	The last time you did that, you then told Erin it was her turn.
5751540	5752020	That's true.
5752020	5752500	All right.
5752500	5753780	And you skipped me.
5753780	5754340	Here we go.
5754340	5754820	I did not.
5754820	5755860	I leave a basket.
5755860	5756900	He took two turns.
5756900	5758500	I hate all games.
5763620	5766340	Shocking grasp on this motherfucker.
5766900	5767380	All right.
5768020	5770420	That motherfucker was weak and petty.
5771540	5772340	Shocking grasp.
5772340	5773380	I'm a craftsman about it.
5773940	5776740	With your arms crackling with electrical energy,
5776740	5780340	you grasp his neck and, surging volts of electricity,
5780340	5781620	charge into his body.
5782660	5783140	Dealing.
5784020	5785060	Catchphrase, do it.
5786100	5787460	Yeah, do your catchphrase.
5787460	5790580	Oh, uh, ice to lightning you.
5790580	5806260	Hey, you folks have hoped miss the lamest high five in the world.
5808100	5808580	Dealing.
5808580	5809620	21 damage.
5815780	5817300	21.
5817300	5818260	Let's throw it to Rob.
5819060	5819540	All right.
5820660	5823780	I hope that guy that called me a fag on Reddit is listening.
5823780	5824260	Thank God.
5825300	5826500	I was 21.
5826500	5827940	I was so wrong.
5827940	5828900	I was so wrong.
5831620	5834900	I'm going to ask a question on behalf of our guest star.
5834900	5835540	Oh, hey, come on.
5836340	5836740	No, no, no.
5836740	5837380	I'm giving it up.
5837380	5838100	Go for it.
5838100	5839700	I mean, I'm here all the time.
5839700	5840180	Sorry.
5840180	5840500	Yeah.
5841060	5841540	Twice.
5842740	5845060	Who are the chains around?
5845060	5845620	Sorry.
5845620	5848740	They're just kind of hanging in the ceiling like rafters.
5848740	5849940	Like you climb around.
5849940	5852180	Yeah, but the chains got shot at me at one point.
5852180	5853140	What are those changes?
5853140	5854740	They get retract stomach.
5854740	5855780	They're stuck in my stomach.
5856500	5857780	Don't heat the chains.
5860820	5863220	She's saying, I have a cell that can heat up metal.
5864820	5866100	Don't heat up the chains.
5866100	5868660	They're still in my esophagus.
5868660	5869220	That's wrong.
5869220	5870260	And give them a hot snake.
5874100	5875540	Um, okay.
5876740	5879540	I'm going to take my round back if that's all right.
5879540	5880100	Okay.
5880100	5882980	Um, shit, man.
5882980	5892580	I mean, can I grab the chains that are, and I have strength of 13.
5894180	5901460	I'm going to try yanking him in and go, yeah, you want to do this?
5902340	5903300	You want to do this?
5903300	5906180	And I'm pulling them in and I'm just, it hurts.
5906180	5910340	And I mean, the chains in my stomach hurt.
5910340	5910820	It hurts.
5910820	5912260	I'm not saying it doesn't hurt.
5912820	5914180	It's not bleeding.
5914180	5918260	But I'm like, you know, gritting my teeth and I'm going, you want this?
5919140	5922900	Kind of hand over hand, pulling him closer to me.
5922900	5925940	I might even do one of those wrapping around my forearm,
5926820	5930180	like an extension cord kind of a thing with the chain.
5930180	5932420	You know what I'm talking about, AB Club.
5932420	5933700	Let's do this.
5933780	5939140	And I'm like pulling him closer as he, as I'm pulling him closer, my eyes are getting wider.
5940260	5947300	And I'm like going, I'm not going to stop pulling these chains closer until we're nose to nose.
5947300	5952900	And then I'm going to do some yellow, uh, post-it note shit on you.
5954980	5955460	Okay.
5955460	5961300	So, so, you know, I mean, come on, you can roll it in everything, but that's pretty cool
5961300	5963220	to not allow me to do.
5963220	5968580	It's a really great thing, but, um, I, as Quark, I'm very, uh, moved by what you're doing
5968580	5969860	and I want to capture my feelings.
5969860	5971140	So I spit on a piece of paper.
5974260	5978260	I don't allow that, that grossness to affect my pulling.
5978260	5980980	So I just like, I grip my teeth even harder.
5980980	5982500	It's a lot heavier than you.
5982500	5985780	So like the end result is you're just kind of like pulling yourself towards him.
5987220	5988020	I'll take it.
5988020	5988740	I'll take it.
5989460	5990500	I'll take it.
5990500	5993940	Can we, can we, can we, can we clip hanger with us nose to nose?
5993940	5996340	Cliff, uh, approach, share.
5996340	5998500	With Tiny Lister and, uh, Hulk Hogan.
5998500	5999220	No, continue, sorry, nose.
6004020	6004900	Do it back.
6004900	6005140	What?
6006740	6008020	I missed that whole thing.
6009620	6013940	I pulled myself closer to him and we're nose to nose and we're growling at each other.
6013940	6015940	Like, oh, you're growling.
6017460	6018580	I feel like he's not going to growl back.
6018580	6019220	He's a robot.
6021460	6021940	All right.
6021940	6024580	Does everyone put mescaline in our vodka tonight?
6025380	6025780	All right.
6025780	6027540	So, all right.
6027540	6028500	Say one last thing.
6030420	6031940	Coco the horse.
6031940	6032420	Yay.
6034740	6035220	All right.
6038100	6041460	Thank you everyone for coming to Harman Town tonight.
6042580	6045380	Thanks for letting me try to be Jeff.

6070820	6071700	I read them all.
6071700	6072500	I read them all.
6073060	6073700	Be nice.
6073780	6078420	I apologize about the mouse and the snake comment, which was very ill received.
6078420	6080900	I appreciate being able to be up here.
6080900	6084500	Thank you very much, Dan Harman, most wonderful person I've ever met.
6084500	6085380	Thank you, sweetie.
6085380	6095060	Thanks, everybody.
