0	7000	This show was filmed on location at Brazos Hall during South by Southwest, sponsored by Yahoo!
30000	38000	Please put your hands together for the rap stylings of your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon!
60000	71000	My name is M.C. John. I'm here to mow the lawn. I put your panties on when you're out and the lights aren't on.
71000	76000	I sneaked into your room. I was inside your womb. Okay, stop.
76000	83000	Terrible. Off to a terrible start. Terrible misogynist, horrible, clinically disgusting show.
83000	93000	You can't rhyme room with anything but womb. No one wants to think about the womb when you're in a sexual way.
93000	103000	The womb is its own thing. You don't want to associate it with the sexual act. You want to associate it with life.
103000	117000	And Texas. Thanks for having us back, Austin, the Portland of Texas, as I call it. You guys are fantastic.
117000	128000	Thanks for waiting around and coming here. We're here in Austin because we're premiering our sixth season of my little show, Community.
134000	139000	There's a little bit of overlap there between the audiences for Community and the podcast.
139000	143000	How many people here are strictly here just for Community?
143000	148000	My applause. It's a podcast. Don't raise your hands. That doesn't get us anywhere.
148000	154000	Okay, how many people here are just die-hard Harmon Town fans and don't give a shit about Community?
155000	158000	You don't want to say, don't give a shit about Community?
158000	161000	I'm just trying to find the polls here.
161000	169000	You're trying to stir shit up. You want to rumble. What did you say, sir? Okay.
171000	174000	The talkback format might not work as well.
174000	178000	We found Texan shy Adam Goldberg.
179000	181000	What's that?
184000	190000	The postman only rings once, and also you don't have a doorbell. He's yelling.
190000	193000	I don't know what that saying means.
193000	200000	So I got nothing, so it's going to be a bad show, but we'll be done about 8.30.
201000	205000	I just walked in the back door and came out here.
205000	211000	More money has been spent promoting Community in this room than in five years.
217000	223000	And by that, I mean there's two vinyl signs and some balloons, which is huge.
223000	227000	It's a 500% increase in the marketing budget for our show.
227000	229000	It's pretty crazy.
229000	235000	Yahoo has been a very, very strange experience for everybody on that sad little show
235000	239000	that has really become accustomed to...
239000	243000	I don't know if I'm supposed to address the sirens or just ignore them.
243000	246000	I don't know what a master performer would do.
246000	249000	Work the sirens into the thing.
249000	251000	Oh no, the sirens are here.
253000	255000	What are you doing out here?
255000	256000	What's all this?
256000	258000	It's a police officer.
258000	259000	Okay.
259000	261000	Anthony Jeslman had a pretty good one.
261000	263000	He was doing a thing, and a siren goes outside.
263000	265000	You can barely hear it on the recording, and he says,
265000	268000	That's how hard I'm killing.
269000	271000	I just stole some guy's joke.
271000	274000	And you credited him.
274000	276000	What was I talking about?
276000	278000	Yahoo's great.
278000	280000	You're saying it was strange for the cast.
280000	281000	It's been a weird experience for them.
281000	282000	Why?
282000	284000	Because they're being treated like a cast of a TV show?
284000	285000	Yeah.
285000	288000	I mean, you would think it was like 1995,
288000	290000	and that we were getting like a free rating or something,
290000	294000	the way that Yahoo talks to the cast and stuff.
294000	298000	They talk about doing Emmy campaigns and promoting the show
298000	300000	and stuff like that.
300000	301000	Yeah.
301000	304000	I've told this story before, but Kathy Stabat,
304000	307000	the CMO of Yahoo came to the set and visited,
307000	309000	and she was like, gathered the cast around
309000	312000	and was just filling them in on what we were going to be doing this year.
312000	315000	And 10 minutes into it, she noticed that they were being really quiet,
315000	318000	and she was like, am I offending you or something?
318000	321000	And then Ken Jeong went really sincerely,
321000	325000	you have to understand, no one's ever talked to us like this before.
327000	330000	And it was really sad and delightful.
331000	334000	But it is like, there's no enemies now, and there's no,
334000	337000	and I don't know if it's going to have a positive or a negative impact
337000	340000	on the contents of the show, because I just work on it,
340000	344000	and now all of a sudden it's like, okay, well, if it's...
346000	349000	Yeah, if there's no Death Star, there's no Darth Vader up there,
349000	351000	why leave Tatooine, man?
351000	357000	Yeah, and why not just make a show about going to Mos Eisley,
357000	360000	and when that guy says, I don't like you either,
360000	363000	you go, well, why don't you get to know me?
364000	367000	And then you just move into an apartment with him,
368000	372000	and there could be structural issues with this season, is what I'm saying.
373000	375000	We got a B-plus in Entertainment Weekly.
377000	378000	No, no.
379000	382000	I sleep on my office couch, this is an A-minus show.
384000	387000	I don't know what they give AAs to, but we got a B-plus.
387000	389000	How many nights a week are you sleeping on the office couch?
389000	390000	All of them?
390000	392000	Literally all week.
392000	396000	Like, Erin just hit a tipping point where she was like,
396000	402000	we either had to identify this as a problem and therefore solve it with divorce,
402000	406000	or we had to look at this as like, this is what it's gonna be
406000	410000	until we're done shooting, and so there'll be days where I just like,
410000	414000	okay, going to sleep on the couch and then I'll wake up and work on a show.
414000	416000	But now I feel self-conscious talking about that
416000	417000	because you're gonna watch it and you're gonna be like,
417000	419000	you slept on your couch?
420000	422000	It's just a karate kid joke.
423000	426000	Could've got home by three at least.
426000	432000	All right, but I want to bring out Spencer right away.
447000	450000	Dan, I'm gonna start from the top, I'm gonna start from the top.
450000	451000	You ready?
452000	454000	I know you have troubles with the intro here.
454000	456000	No, you're gonna start right away, right?
456000	458000	I can wait one bar.
458000	459000	I can wait one bar.
459000	461000	You can wait as long as you want.
461000	462000	No, two bars?
462000	464000	State the one wherever you...
464000	465000	It's always on the one, man.
465000	467000	Spencer, make yourself comfortable.
467000	468000	Spencer's over there.
468000	471000	I like that they've given you a nice Barcelona chair over there.
471000	472000	That's very groovy.
472000	473000	Is that what you call this?
473000	474000	Is this a Barcelona chair?
474000	477000	I believe it's a reproduction of what they used to call a Barcelona chair.
477000	479000	Who is it, by Miller or Noel or something?
479000	482000	Oh, well, this is an IKEA article.
482000	484000	No, it's not an original one.
484000	487000	I think they call it a Flonox.
487000	489000	A Flonox?
489000	491000	They call it a Stub-Norts.
491000	493000	All right, Dan, Spencer rap.
497000	502000	From the day I saw Spencer, I fell in love.
502000	504000	Meet me two, two.
504000	506000	You fell in love.
506000	510000	Spencer is like a turtle dove.
510000	512000	Meet me two, two.
512000	514000	Put your mama in the pussy, but you're a turtle dove.
514000	516000	Family.
516000	518000	Spencer is family.
518000	520000	Sock, sock, shoe, shoe.
520000	523000	Put your mother and your daddy in the forest, too.
523000	525000	Okay, stop it.
530000	532000	You're right, you're right.
532000	533000	You're right.
533000	535000	What's happening up here is entertainment.
535000	537000	You're right.
537000	539000	I'm not going to burst that bubble.
539000	542000	You are certainly right to applaud and woo for that.
542000	546000	That certainly wasn't what would have happened if your uncle had come up here.
546000	548000	With a drink in his hand.
548000	552000	This is nothing like just one of your weddings, what's going on.
552000	556000	It's actual entertainment that's worthy of being broadcast and paid for.
556000	559000	You're absolutely right.
559000	564000	So you're still rocking the flannel, even though it's a little arid out here.
564000	567000	Oh, it's quite arid out here, Dan.
569000	571000	That sigh wasn't for you, it was for me.
571000	573000	Oh.
573000	575000	Do you think we're going to play something tonight?
575000	577000	Because I don't care, we don't have to.
577000	582000	Well, yeah, I was thinking maybe we could start off with some checkers, move into some tag.
582000	584000	Okay.
584000	586000	We'll figure it out.
586000	591000	Do you have a bee in your bonnet, politically, socially, or economically?
591000	593000	Oh, man.
594000	595000	I don't know. Okay.
595000	598000	So I listen to this radio station that it's big claim to fame,
598000	601000	as they're always talking about how commercial free they are.
601000	605000	Every commercial break, they say commercial free.
605000	610000	It's stupid as fuck, but the worst thing is they go commercial free, starting now.
610000	613000	They play one song and then they do two minutes of commercials.
613000	617000	That's literally the opposite of commercial free.
617000	621000	And this is the selling point of the station, is that they're commercial free.
621000	624000	They're saying they're commercial free, but there are commercials?
624000	629000	They're saying they're commercial free one song before playing a three-minute block of commercials.
629000	632000	Yeah. More commercials than music.
632000	633000	Bullshit.
633000	636000	So they're just letting you know the commercials are over for the time being.
636000	638000	Yeah, for one song.
638000	642000	But you'd also know that if you started hearing the song being played.
642000	645000	Why are you listening to radio?
645000	647000	You're a star child.
647000	649000	Why do you even know about radio?
649000	655000	You know, sometimes my Apple watch is broken.
655000	656000	You do?
656000	658000	Yeah.
658000	661000	It was really tragic when the Apple watch got announced.
661000	663000	Are you going to get an Apple watch?
663000	668000	No, it's pretty dumb if we're honest.
668000	669000	Too soon.
669000	672000	It's all about that, what do you call it?
672000	673000	Galaxy wear.
673000	675000	Is that what they call it?
676000	679000	Samsung wrist.
679000	680000	Oh, is that?
680000	685000	We're not in some way indirectly affiliated with Samsung today, are we?
685000	686000	No, no.
686000	689000	I know sometimes that happens.
689000	693000	Good riff about the Uber sexual harassment.
693000	698000	The president of Ubers in the back, he wants to say you're welcome for the catering.
698000	699000	Oh, shit.
699000	700000	God damn it.
700000	703000	I didn't even have any of that catering.
703000	705000	I sat in front of a guy on the flight out here.
705000	709000	I walked on the plane and the first guy I see, Robert Duvall sitting on the plane.
709000	710000	That's badass.
710000	711000	That was very cool.
711000	712000	And he looked bummed out.
712000	713000	He didn't like it.
713000	716000	He looked like he was not happy to be coming to South by Southwest.
716000	720000	What do you think that would sound like if Robert Duvall was bummed out on a plane?
720000	723000	I'm on a big, big titted plane.
723000	725000	It's a big titted plane.
725000	729000	But then I go back and I'm sitting way back in steerage and there's two guys behind me
729000	734000	and it was like sitting in front of two abeds from community.
734000	736000	And they were out abetting each other.
736000	737000	It was like, cool.
737000	738000	Yeah, cool.
738000	739000	Yeah, so I did this.
739000	740000	Yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
740000	742000	And one of the guys worked for Samsung.
742000	745000	I know that because he said it 9 fucking thousand times during that.
745000	749000	At one point, actually, I got up and said, do you guys mind?
749000	754000	They were talking full, louder than I'm talking right now on a plane full of adult people.
755000	760000	How loud in comparison to how loud the audience is talking right now?
768000	773000	Every time we come to South by Southwest, we're always somehow in a room where there's an auction happening.
773000	774000	I know.
774000	776000	Are we at a FUD Rutgers?
776000	778000	What the fuck is going on?
778000	779000	I don't understand.
779000	780000	Is there something?
780000	781000	Are we double booked?
781000	783000	Is there a bachelor party?
783000	786000	I know it can't be anyone's fault, but who the fuck is talking?
786000	789000	What is going on?
789000	792000	The last time we did it, it was we booked it.
792000	795000	And I thought, oh, I guess that's we screwed up this room like the last place.
795000	798000	It's all brick and glass and nothing but reflective surfaces.
798000	804000	And it's the last place there is an excuse because it was literally just a hotel lobby.
804000	806000	Like anyone could be there.
806000	811000	Like I don't know how people get in, but apparently there is a lot of trouble from some people trying to get in.
811000	813000	So I don't there's no excuse.
813000	814000	I mean, we see this guy.
814000	819000	We could come down hard on these people and say it could be quiet, but then we'd have to replace that silence with entertainment.
819000	820000	Yeah, that's tricky.
820000	821000	Oh, no. Yeah, that's the thing.
821000	824000	That's why I don't complain because I'm not like going to be like, hey, shut up over there.
824000	830000	I'm trying to do what you're doing, but in a more entitled way.
832000	835000	I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to.
835000	841000	We're being heckled by the people that want to listen.
842000	844000	I, sir, I can't.
844000	846000	I can't.
849000	851000	That emperor is naked.
853000	855000	If you don't know, I mean, come on.
857000	859000	Well, wait, come on.
859000	860000	What are you doing?
860000	861000	Are you on the staff?
862000	864000	Oh, you're just wearing a OK.
864000	866000	I just want to be a part of your awesome day.
867000	869000	What the fuck is happening?
870000	877000	I feel like Harmon town has crossed a threshold where we've been so laissez faire about letting letting the.
877000	878000	Hey, everybody at the bar.
878000	879000	Shut the fuck up.
880000	882000	It's not going to work.
882000	883000	I love you. I love you.
884000	886000	If you want to be a part of it, come up and grab a mic.
886000	888000	Let's let's meet you.
888000	889000	Side line guy.
895000	897000	South by Southwest.
897000	900000	Going to meet a person where the vast.

917000	918000	Apologies.
918000	919000	Apologies.
922000	923000	Don't boo him.
925000	926000	I'm sorry.
927000	928000	I shouldn't tell you what to do.
929000	930000	All right, Jordan.
930000	931000	Why are you at South by Southwest?
931000	935000	I'm at South by Southwest because me and my partner Ryan Brown.
935000	937000	We're starting an alcohol delivery app.
937000	938000	It's called Top Shell.
938000	941000	Are you just up here to plug your own shit right now?
944000	946000	He he he asked me.
946000	947000	He asked me.
948000	951000	Jordan Jordan.
951000	952000	I'm going to ask you a question.
952000	954000	I want you to be very honest with me.
954000	955000	Yes, sir.
955000	956000	You were standing over in the sidelines standing up.
956000	959000	Not not seated standing right on the stage right edge of the stage.
959000	960000	And you said tweet me.
960000	961000	Give me a tweet.
961000	962000	Shout out.
962000	963000	No, no, no.
963000	965000	I asked for his Twitter handle so we could tweet him.
965000	967000	So you you could tweet him.
967000	968000	Yes.
968000	970000	Because that would get Dan what a million more followers.
970000	971000	Or what happened?
971000	972000	No, no.
972000	974000	I said I liked him because I thought he was funny.
974000	975000	You like him.
975000	978000	And yet the moment you get on stage, you start shilling your product.
978000	980000	No, not at all.
980000	983000	I don't know how much of a crime that is.
983000	988000	I mean, it's South by Southwest has been infiltrated by capitalist interests.
989000	992000	It's the secrets out because Dan.
992000	996000	There's not a lot of people here for the spiritual edification of it.
996000	997000	You've got to be.
997000	999000	You've got to give me some fairness here.
999000	1000000	You did ask me.
1000000	1001000	Yes.
1001000	1002000	That's an honest answer.
1002000	1003000	You're here because of this product.
1003000	1004000	I don't mean to.
1004000	1008000	I feel ironically compelled to like stick up for anybody who's being like.
1008000	1013000	I think we let you on stage in the same way the Germans let the troops at Normandy on
1013000	1014000	the beach.
1015000	1021000	I feel like you were you were coming up here no matter how that was too soon.
1021000	1022000	I'm sorry.
1023000	1025000	I disagree.
1025000	1026000	I thought it was.
1026000	1028000	I thought it was an ambush to Dan.
1028000	1032000	I'd like to hear more about his alcohol distribution app that.
1033000	1035000	Who doesn't like to drink.
1035000	1036000	Right.
1036000	1037000	We're all drinking here.
1037000	1038000	I don't like a drink.
1038000	1040000	What do I do with your app?
1040000	1041000	I don't drink.
1041000	1042000	You don't drink.
1042000	1043000	Yeah.
1043000	1046000	So what's in it for me?
1046000	1047000	Do you do weed?
1047000	1048000	What's that?
1048000	1049000	Do you should do weed.
1049000	1051000	We do do weed.
1051000	1052000	Oh yeah.
1052000	1053000	Yeah.
1053000	1054000	Well, eventually.
1054000	1055000	No, we're not there yet.
1055000	1056000	Okay.
1056000	1057000	Wait, Jordan, is that seriously?
1057000	1058000	What is the what is the app?
1058000	1060000	Is it like a yummy dot com?
1060000	1062000	Like you deliver booze to people?
1062000	1064000	When you get on the app, we cannot.
1064000	1065000	Excuse me.
1065000	1070920	We connect with your local liquor stores and we display their inventory on your iPhone.
1070920	1074000	So basically you can scroll through say I want a bottle of Jamison and a six pack of
1074000	1076440	china and we bring it to you in under an hour.
1076440	1081000	So whether you live in Texas or wherever.
1081000	1083360	Now you're not the one driving when they bring it, right?
1083360	1084520	No, we actually.
1084520	1087000	Because you've been using this app all day.
1087000	1088000	Yes.
1088000	1089000	Which is fine.
1089000	1090000	Like you're a spokesman for it.
1090000	1091000	I've been walking.
1091000	1092000	I've been.
1092000	1093000	Uber is awesome.
1093000	1094000	Yeah.
1094000	1095000	So okay.
1095000	1098320	So it's like it's like one of the it's just it's another one of those not to not to trivialize
1098320	1099320	it.
1099320	1102100	It's another kind of peer to peer or no, that's not the word.
1102100	1106680	It's a fucking thing that delivers alcohol.
1106680	1111200	It's like a pink pink elephant or I don't know what what's local or what's what was
1111200	1115880	the Giz Giz Gizmodo bling bling blue blue.
1115880	1117880	It's just like grab hub, grab hub, grab hub.
1117880	1120120	It's like grab hub for booze.
1120120	1123200	Why is it like an episode of Price is Right?
1123200	1125560	Everyone's yelling shit out.
1125560	1128320	It's an it's an it's an infomercial.
1128320	1132560	Now I don't know about you, but every time I want to get drunk, I'm always too far away
1132560	1133560	from the booze.
1133560	1134560	There you go.
1134560	1135560	All right.
1135560	1136560	Yeah.
1136560	1137560	All right.
1137560	1144120	Well, thank you, Jordan, for Jordan, Jordan, I'm gonna let you guys get back to the show.
1144120	1146280	I really do appreciate you guys.
1146280	1147280	Jordan, real quick.
1147280	1148280	Jordan, real quick.
1148280	1149280	We'll give you a plug.
1149280	1150560	What's up again?
1150560	1151560	Top shelf.
1151560	1152560	Top shelf.
1152560	1154440	You can follow us on on Instagram.
1154440	1156040	We're just at Top Shelf.
1156040	1157040	Okay, Jordan.
1157040	1158040	Pretty simple.
1158040	1161040	Jordan, you're a booze delivery professional, right?
1161040	1162040	Oh, yeah.
1162040	1163040	And lots of training.
1163040	1164040	Lots of training.
1164040	1166280	And we allowed we allowed you up on stage.
1166280	1167680	We plugged your product, right?
1167680	1168680	Right.
1168680	1169680	Now, Jordan, do me a favor.
1169680	1170680	I'll get the fuck out of here.
1170680	1171680	I know.
1171680	1172680	I'd like a double bullet ride on the rocks.
1172680	1175680	Go grab me a drink.
1175680	1177880	Will you get it for Jeff?
1177880	1180880	The reputation of your company is on the line.
1180880	1181880	I'm on the way, baby.
1181880	1182880	All right.
1182880	1183880	We're timing him.
1183880	1184880	Time him.
1184880	1186880	Someone's got to stopwatch.
1186880	1187880	Play some music.
1187880	1188880	How long it takes him to bring you liquor?
1188880	1193880	Look, he's really doing it.
1193880	1196880	Hey, Jordan, tick tock.
1196880	1200880	Oh, we're getting a lot of gestures.
1200880	1207640	Oh, looks like new media has failed us again.
1207640	1211680	So my name is Top Shelf, and I'm here to say you ain't getting a motherfucking drink.
1211680	1212680	No way.
1212680	1213680	I can't get you a booze.
1213680	1214680	Can't get you a drink.
1214680	1216080	Because my fucking app really is tick.
1216080	1217080	I didn't...
1217080	1218080	Jesus Christ.
1218080	1219080	All right.
1219080	1221600	I didn't ask for a goddamn beer, Jordan.
1221600	1224840	I asked for a bullet ride on the rocks.
1224840	1225840	This is...
1225840	1226840	Oh, no.
1226840	1227840	Bullet ride.
1227840	1229640	That is my favorite drink, by the way.
1229640	1230960	A Jack Daniels on the rocks.
1230960	1231960	Go, Jordan.
1231960	1232960	Go.
1232960	1233960	Jack Daniels.
1233960	1234960	Jack Daniels.
1234960	1235960	There's no liquor here, guys.
1235960	1236960	There's no liquor here, guys.
1237280	1238280	There's no liquor here.
1238280	1239280	I'm serious.
1239280	1240280	I'm serious.
1240280	1241280	I'm serious.
1241280	1247720	Jordan, Jordan, you know what you should do if there's no whiskey or you should use
1247720	1248720	your app.
1248720	1249720	Take it out.
1249720	1260720	Unfortunately, our app is not live until this next time.
1260720	1261720	Wait.
1261720	1262720	Wait.
1262720	1263720	I got a...
1263720	1264720	Wait.
1264720	1265720	I got a...
1265720	1266720	Just, Jeff.
1267480	1272680	I'm not waiting six days for a drink, Jordan.
1272680	1275880	You are the Uber of booze apps.
1275880	1276880	We have launched.
1276880	1278600	We've asked Apple.
1278600	1280600	They rejected our advance.
1280600	1285040	We tried to make it, but we're coming.
1285040	1288800	Well, my grandpa lied about his age so he could fight in World War II.
1288800	1289800	We're American.
1289800	1291880	I don't know what that means.
1291880	1294240	All right, Jordan, give me that beer.
1294240	1295240	Thank you for...
1295240	1296240	Jordan, everybody.
1296240	1297840	What else?
1297840	1298840	It's a...
1298840	1299840	Come on.
1299840	1306720	It's a weird world and it's a new generation taking the battle to the streets.
1306720	1312600	There's 300 million of us and our economy's going to be fine because it's in those hands.
1312600	1318400	Our nation has determined it refuses to lift things, manufacture things, export things,
1318400	1319400	but we're on it.
1319400	1321880	We're an innovation economy.
1321880	1324960	We're dreamers and that's going to pay the rent.
1324960	1332600	Can I just say, did anyone else find it weird that his business only had an Instagram account?
1332600	1337760	I feel like you start with Twitter or Facebook, right?
1337760	1338760	Instagram is...
1338760	1339760	I don't know.
1339760	1340760	I don't know.
1340760	1341760	All right.
1341760	1344720	I got a special guest that I wanted to chat with, but let's...
1344720	1347480	Actually, let's bring him up first.
1347480	1356560	Ladies and gentlemen, my partner, the shelf to my top shelf dot com, who years ago at
1356560	1360480	South by Southwest said, let's come up with an app that delivers entertainment to people
1360480	1362880	upon request.
1362880	1365180	So we started making this show together.
1365180	1369480	Please welcome the other executive producer of Community, Chris McKenna.
1369480	1372480	There he is.
1372480	1374480	He's coming.
1375480	1382480	From the day I met Chris McKenna, I knew he was the one.
1382480	1384480	Look at this leisurely walk of the stage.
1384480	1390480	He's a giant Irish man that likes the fun.
1390480	1394480	Family, family, family.
1394480	1398480	Chris McKenna's here.
1398480	1407480	Take a mic at any seat you like.
1407480	1409480	Yes.
1409480	1419480	Hey, Jordan, he just gave me a sip of whiskey.
1419480	1423480	Jordan, he has other podcasts to ambush.
1423480	1425480	Is it on?
1426480	1429480	Is that guy just walking around town, storming stages?
1429480	1431480	Check.
1431480	1432480	I can't find a...
1432480	1438480	There's a tiny switch there, but my hands are full.
1438480	1440480	Check.
1440480	1442480	Tiny delicate fingers of Jeff Davis.
1442480	1443480	Thank you.
1443480	1445480	Chris McKenna, I like the way that...
1445480	1446480	Oh, wait.
1446480	1447480	No, that was just a sip.
1447480	1450480	It was for you.
1450480	1451480	Get an app.
1451480	1453480	I thought you were just setting it down.
1453480	1454480	Oh, sure.
1455480	1457480	Okay, somebody keep your eye on the time.
1457480	1462480	Can we bring Harmon and Dino Hybrid up on stage real quick in the front row?
1462480	1463480	Will you come up on stage, sir?
1463480	1464480	Can we get Dan...
1464480	1465480	No, no, no.
1465480	1466480	Reading Rainbow?
1466480	1467480	Yeah?
1467480	1468480	Reading Rainbow.
1468480	1469480	You can talk about that guy.
1469480	1470480	You want him to...
1470480	1471480	Only if he wants to.
1471480	1473480	Do you want to come up on stage?
1473480	1475480	Or at least just stand up.
1475480	1476480	This guy looks a little bit...
1476480	1481480	If Dan Harmon and Dino Stamatopoulos had a child together...
1481480	1484480	If Starburn and some community and Dan had a love child,
1484480	1487480	there'd be this gentleman right here.
1487480	1489480	I can fiddle with that mic.
1489480	1490480	Check.
1490480	1492480	Here, Dan.
1492480	1494480	Rainbow.
1494480	1496480	Yeah, Jeff is saying...
1496480	1498480	We're feeding this on video, right?
1498480	1499480	So some people can partake of this.
1499480	1500480	This is exciting.
1500480	1502480	No, it's not a live stream today, Dan.
1502480	1504480	Oh, okay.
1504480	1510480	So Jeff's saying you look like if me and Dino had a baby.
1510480	1511480	All right.
1511480	1514480	She knows.
1514480	1517480	What's your name?
1517480	1518480	Mike.
1518480	1519480	Use the mic.
1519480	1520480	Use the mic.
1520480	1521480	Mike.
1521480	1522480	Yeah, like an ice cream.
1522480	1523480	Yeah, there you go.
1523480	1524480	Is it working?
1524480	1525480	It's working.
1525480	1530480	Also, I mean, you were brought on stage because of how you look, so...
1530480	1532480	That's working, man.
1532480	1533480	Okay.
1533480	1536480	You got a Reading Rainbow shirt and...
1536480	1538480	Oh, it's Jordan.
1538480	1539480	Reading Rainbow.
1539480	1540480	Jordan's back, everybody.
1540480	1541480	He's got something in his backpack.
1541480	1542480	He's better not be a bomb.
1542480	1543480	He's got something in his backpack.
1543480	1544480	Oh!
1544480	1545480	Oh!
1545480	1567480	Jordan just brought me a full bottle of Bullet Rye Whiskey.
1568480	1569480	I take it all back.
1569480	1570480	That was pretty quick.
1570480	1573480	Pretty goddamn fast.
1573480	1580480	There's another app called the Austin Police that don't allow that, by the way.
1580480	1584480	As you notice, there's no kettle up here or even Tito's.
1584480	1587480	I'm allowed to receive gifts if I don't open them up on stage, probably.
1587480	1589480	It's unopened, so that should be fine.
1589480	1590480	All right.
1590480	1591480	Thank you, Jordan.
1591480	1592480	Well, thank you, Mike.
1592480	1594480	I mean, unless you have something you'd like to plug, I think you should...
1594480	1595480	I don't know.
1596480	1597480	I don't know.
1597480	1598480	Thank you, Jordan.
1598480	1599480	This might be too much.
1599480	1600480	Thank you.
1600480	1601480	That'll be all.
1601480	1603480	That's all we need.
1603480	1604480	Jordan, wait.
1604480	1607480	Table five needs bread.
1607480	1608480	That's Jeff's joke.
1608480	1609480	Jeff's joke.
1609480	1610480	Thank you.
1610480	1611480	Thank you, Mike.
1611480	1612480	Mike, everybody.
1612480	1614480	Mike's got an app, too.
1614480	1615480	All right.
1615480	1616480	Let's play...
1616480	1622480	Who wants to ask Chris McKenna a question about community?
1623480	1627480	Dan is going out into the audience with his little baby run.
1627480	1630480	Anyone raise your hand if you've got a question for Chris McKenna,
1630480	1632480	executive producer of Community.
1632480	1633480	Thank you.
1633480	1634480	All right.
1634480	1635480	I like this guy.
1635480	1639480	What's your question for Chris McKenna, who's made Community what it is?
1639480	1642480	What's your favorite episode?
1642480	1643480	Boring.
1644480	1645480	Just kidding.
1645480	1646480	What is your favorite episode?
1646480	1649480	You mean of Community or just any TV show of all time?
1649480	1650480	Obviously of Community.
1650480	1653480	How much diplomacy episode of News Radio?
1653480	1654480	Okay.
1654480	1655480	All right.
1655480	1656480	Moving on.
1656480	1657480	This guy's...
1657480	1658480	Second?
1658480	1660480	Dungeons and Dragons.
1660480	1661480	Okay, Chris.
1661480	1665480	Well, wife and I, we tweet, we do whatever we can to the sponsors of Community.
1665480	1667480	In the past, we still want to do it moving forward.
1667480	1674480	So moving forward, what can the fans do to help support Community as we rock on?
1675480	1682480	You know, I get asked that so often that you're getting tired of hearing my response.
1682480	1684480	I have no idea.
1684480	1687480	I honestly just love it and watch it.
1687480	1689480	Aren't people supposed to just watch TV?
1689480	1694480	I mean, like, when did we let them trick us into thinking that we needed to work for our television?
1694480	1697480	Like a bunch of fucking proles in an Orwell novel.
1697480	1698480	An Orwell novel.
1698480	1699480	1984.
1700480	1702480	Dan, name another Orwell...
1703480	1705480	Moby Dick, bitch!
1706480	1712480	No, honestly, Yahoo said when they came on, look, tell everyone to back off.
1713480	1714480	Back the fuck off.
1714480	1716480	This is all us.
1717480	1718480	Tell the fans.
1718480	1719480	No, just watch it.
1719480	1720480	I hope you guys enjoy it.
1720480	1724480	And if you love it, you know, talk about it with your friends.
1726480	1727480	We don't want to enlist you guys.
1727480	1728480	I mean, just love it.
1728480	1731480	But when you do talk about it, don't do that thing with your face.
1733480	1735480	You know what I'm talking about.
1735480	1736480	You don't?
1736480	1737480	Ugh.
1738480	1744480	What's your question in this all-male question and answer themed period?
1744480	1746480	I hope it's about wieners.
1746480	1749480	What's your favorite physical feature of Dan Harmon?
1751480	1752480	It is about a wiener.
1752480	1753480	That's good.
1753480	1755480	You don't even have to answer, Chris.
1755480	1758480	I'm doing a montage in my head.
1759480	1763480	All of them, I want to take every element and then do this to it.
1765480	1766480	But the dead eyes.
1766480	1769480	I think the dead stare.
1772480	1775480	Let's mix up the all-male Q&A with a female question.
1775480	1778480	I bet it's going to have eyelashes and a pink bow.
1778480	1779480	This question.
1783480	1784480	You can muster one.
1784480	1786480	It's kind of related.
1787480	1789480	Did you watch Gillian Jacobs on Girls?
1789480	1790480	Who?
1790480	1794480	I have not seen Gillian on Girls, but I love the idea of her being on it.
1795480	1796480	No, I did not.
1797480	1799480	You didn't see Gillian on Girls?
1799480	1800480	I did not.
1800480	1801480	Yeah.
1801480	1803480	That really was a female question.
1803480	1804480	Yeah, I know.
1804480	1807480	I felt like a stereotype, so I failed.
1807480	1810480	Will you say hey to Megan because she's dying that she's not here?
1810480	1813480	Will you say hey to Megan because she's dying that she's not here?
1814480	1815480	All right.
1815480	1816480	Hey, Megan.
1817480	1818480	We miss you.
1820480	1822480	We know you have that thing going on.
1822480	1823480	Thank you.
1823480	1824480	We're all pulling for you.
1824480	1827480	Some of us more than less, more than others.
1827480	1830480	But anyway, Megan, call me.
1832480	1833480	Wow.
1833480	1834480	This is really, yeah.
1834480	1835480	This is working out.
1835480	1836480	This is what happened.
1836480	1837480	This is Gans, right?
1837480	1838480	We're talking about Megan.
1838480	1840480	By the way, the show is so much better off stage.
1841480	1842480	I don't know why.
1842480	1843480	All right.
1843480	1845480	Let's get a handsome Patton Oswalt desk.
1845480	1846480	Thank you.
1848480	1852480	If you were in front of a room full of people and had to rank the Rocky training montages
1852480	1855480	from worst to best, what would you do?
1857480	1858480	Oh, boy.
1858480	1861480	I'd rack my brain for all the Rocky montages, I guess.
1861480	1863480	The one with the chicken first?
1863480	1866480	Yeah, the chicken ones gotta be the best one.
1866480	1869480	But then you had the Carl Weathers one?
1869480	1872480	I like the one on the beach, on the Venice Beach.
1872480	1877480	What about the one where they're intercutting it with Yvonne Drago and Rocky's out in the
1877480	1879480	snow doing real shit and then Yvonne Drago...
1879480	1880480	It's all high tech.
1880480	1883480	High tech, 1990s or late 1980s.
1883480	1885480	He punches a robot and does steroids.
1885480	1888480	Yeah, it's at the height of Reaganomics.
1888480	1893480	It's like, yeah, we're the underdogs because the Russians have all of this amazing equipment.
1893480	1897480	Poor little American Rocky has to train with a stick.
1898480	1906480	If you've ever seen the Russian arcade games, you know they were all top flight on top of
1906480	1908480	all of their electronics.
1908480	1912480	I think we all miss the Cold War now, even people that weren't born during it, because
1912480	1918480	they must watch movies and TV from the Cold War era and go, man, that was so simple and
1918480	1919480	innocent.
1919480	1922480	It was just a bunch of other white people you were kind of mad at.
1922480	1923480	Yeah.
1923480	1928480	You made spy thrillers about it and the only people that got hurt were people that their
1928480	1931480	countries were too hard to pronounce to be on the news.
1931480	1938480	No, it was great to watch movies where we were supposed to be suddenly worried about
1938480	1940480	ducking and covering, right?
1940480	1941480	Yeah.
1941480	1945480	Yeah, the idea that the world was at stake all day because it was just about Coke and
1945480	1946480	Pepsi.
1946480	1947480	So simple.
1947480	1951480	And then those towers came down.
1951480	1954480	Oh, that's funny?
1954480	1956480	What a generation.
1956480	1961480	Or the wall came down and then it was like movies like, I don't know, what is it?
1961480	1962480	The Dream Team?
1962480	1966480	Yeah, Dream Team I think was a response to the Berlin Wall coming down.
1966480	1968480	I'm pretty sure.
1968480	1969480	Night Breeders?
1969480	1970480	Night Breeders.
1970480	1971480	I think it's just Night Breed.
1971480	1972480	They don't care.
1972480	1975480	Nobody cares.
1975480	1976480	That ends the segment.
1976480	1978480	I asked Chris McKenna a question.
1978480	1979480	I'm so sorry.
1979480	1980480	No, no.
1980480	1982960	It's just they don't, I mean, they don't care about Night Breed.
1982960	1983960	I've talked to them about it.
1983960	1984960	They don't care.
1984960	1986760	And they don't care about race either.
1986760	1988080	That's what's really frustrating.
1988080	1991080	Speaking of, how are you, sir?
1991080	1993600	You're raising your hand.
1993600	1996480	How many meow meow beans does Dan Harmon get?
1996480	1998800	Okay, that's a bonus question for you.
1998800	2001800	How many meow meow beans?
2001800	2004080	Well, I don't know.
2004080	2006280	It's kind of a gotcha question.
2006280	2007280	It is.
2007280	2010800	You know, he's a man of the people, so he should be a one or a two.
2010800	2011800	Right.
2011800	2013520	But he's the secret elitist.
2013520	2014520	So six?
2014520	2015520	Yeah.
2015520	2016520	All right.
2016520	2017520	All right.
2017520	2019480	Now, that definitely ends the segment.
2019480	2020480	Why?
2020480	2021800	You pointed at him.
2021800	2025600	You had a really good question?
2025600	2027680	He pointed his beard.
2027680	2031600	Chris, are you going to be playing Shadowrun tonight?
2031600	2032600	Oh.
2032600	2033600	Oh.
2033600	2036280	I wish I could take a picture.
2036280	2037280	Wait.
2037280	2038280	Oh, wait.
2038280	2039280	I've seen...
2039280	2040280	Oh.
2040280	2041280	What?
2041280	2042280	I know the answer to that, sir.
2042280	2043280	We're actually going to bring Jordan back up to the show.
2043280	2044280	Is that the book I keep on seeing you with?
2044280	2045280	Yeah.
2045280	2047280	Jordan's got a show.
2047280	2048280	I would love to.
2048280	2049280	I've not been invited.
2049280	2053120	Do you guys notice how unanimously the crowd instantly didn't like Jordan when he came
2053120	2054120	up?
2054120	2056280	It was just a unanimous booing right off the bat.
2056280	2057280	Right.
2057280	2061280	I don't know if this show has ever had a villain, but that guy seems like...
2061280	2062280	Absolutely.
2062280	2065280	The show's had a lot of villains, but he really took the cake.
2066280	2068280	He was hard-bocked there from Die Hard.
2068280	2072000	I feel like we're trading down, because last time I was in Austin here, we had the guy
2072000	2076000	that came up and talked about Bitcoin, and he was amazing.
2076000	2077000	He smelled good.
2077000	2078480	But he was doing the same thing that Jordan was doing.
2078480	2080080	Yeah, but he was dynamic and awesome.
2080080	2082280	Well, his product is more interesting.
2082280	2084280	He smelled like delicious candy, too.
2084280	2085280	Yeah.
2085280	2090280	But it has to be observed that the guy, he slid into that role, and then he came back,
2090280	2091280	and when everybody...
2091280	2095200	He came back with his backpack, and then everyone was like, whoa, boo!
2095200	2096200	I think...
2096200	2097200	And we never felt more alive.
2097200	2101880	I think the coolest thing about the Top Shelf app is that I'm not paying for this whiskey.
2101880	2102880	It's totally free.
2102880	2103880	Yeah.
2103880	2106600	I've been in a community since season one.
2106600	2110320	If there's anything that you need to be more alive, it's a villain.
2110320	2111320	Yeah.
2111320	2112320	You absolutely need a villain.
2112320	2115400	You've been surrounded by them, by community.
2115400	2116400	It's only...
2116400	2117400	Oh, okay.
2117400	2118400	Yes.
2118400	2119400	This...
2119400	2120400	And Harmatown needs a villain.
2120400	2121400	It makes it better.
2121400	2122400	Yeah.
2122400	2123400	I got to...
2123400	2124400	You're saying there's no villain at Yahoo?
2124600	2125600	No.
2125600	2127800	No, we're scraping around looking for one.
2127800	2129440	No, it's like...
2129440	2132640	There was a security guard that was bugging us for a while.
2132640	2133640	There's that guy who won't...
2133640	2135580	That's some low-stakes potatoes.
2135580	2139200	There's a guy who won't steam clean the floors.
2139200	2140200	Fuck that guy.
2140200	2141200	There is a...
2141200	2146200	Yeah, there is a guy at CBS Radford that says that we keep pouring our coffee on the concrete,
2146200	2150160	and he doesn't want to steam clean the concrete, because we pour our coffee on it.
2150160	2151160	He's insane.
2151160	2154220	Can you imagine if a janitor was like, I saw that guy litter.
2154220	2156460	I'm not going to do my job anymore.
2156460	2159300	Also, nobody pours coffee on concrete.
2159300	2160300	He's making it up.
2160300	2164060	That's where the garbage guy puts the garbage bags, and all the garbage juice leaks into
2164060	2165300	that spot.
2165300	2167980	We're the ones that are there 24 hours a day.
2167980	2168980	Concrete steamer can...
2168980	2169980	Fuck off.
2169980	2170980	Yeah.
2170980	2173260	I mean, I'd steam clean...
2173260	2175020	They could pay me to steam clean the concrete.
2175020	2176020	I'd do it.
2176020	2177020	I'd do it for fun.
2177020	2178020	It sounds fucking amazing.
2178020	2179020	I know.
2179020	2182660	Doesn't it sound fun just to do once, like being a DJ or a teacher?
2182660	2185540	Just do it for like an hour, steam clean concrete.
2185540	2187100	It sounds like really cool.
2187100	2189540	Okay, maybe I'm wrong.
2189540	2191140	No, you're absolutely wrong.
2191140	2194500	I'd also like to tar a driveway.
2194500	2195500	Tar a driveway?
2195500	2198420	Yeah, just for like 20 minutes.
2198420	2200140	Just the tar, no asphalt on top?
2200140	2201140	Just lay the tar down?
2201140	2202140	I see you're already...
2202140	2203140	This is amazing.
2203140	2204140	I don't know.
2204140	2205140	What do you do?
2205140	2206140	If I don't put anything underneath, do you just sink into the tar?
2206140	2210820	I believe that tar is the thing that is the adhesive that holds the top surface.
2210820	2213260	What's the top surface made out of just driveway material?
2213260	2214580	And gravel and...
2214580	2215580	It's cement, isn't it?
2215580	2216580	Well, it can't be.
2216580	2217580	See, this is amazing.
2217580	2218580	How can you tar a roof?
2218580	2219580	Right.
2219580	2220580	You don't put rebar on a driveway, madam.
2220580	2221580	You could.
2221580	2222580	Rebar?
2222580	2223580	There's rebar in a driveway?
2223580	2224580	Really?
2224580	2225580	Are you building a superhighway?
2225580	2226580	Well, it's a big part.
2226580	2227580	Think about it.
2227580	2228580	Bars are heavy, you know, so...
2228580	2229580	Oh, good point.
2229580	2230580	All right.
2230580	2231580	You're right.
2231580	2232580	You're right.
2232580	2233580	All right.
2233580	2234580	You're right.
2234580	2235580	You're right.
2235580	2236580	All right.
2236580	2237580	You're right.
2238020	2242020	If you have one more thing to say about rebar, you have to come up, because they...
2242020	2244340	Do you have more opinions about rebar?
2244340	2246660	Do you have more opinions about rebar?
2246660	2247660	No.
2247660	2248660	I was...
2248660	2250140	I took too long to explain that.
2250140	2253420	I was just saying you'd have to come up if you...
2253420	2254420	You appear to have a walker.
2254420	2256260	I don't know if we could get you up on stage with that thing.
2256260	2257260	What's that?
2257260	2258260	Are you wounded?
2258260	2259260	What happened?
2259260	2260260	My spine is collapsing.
2260260	2261260	Your spine is collapsing?
2261260	2262260	Oh, my God.
2262260	2263260	Now you have to come up.
2263260	2264260	Or no, you can't.
2264260	2265260	Sorry.
2266260	2269420	I don't know how much you can hear what you can't hear.
2269420	2272420	This young lady started talking about rebar pipe, and then I was like, well, we can't
2272420	2273420	hear you.
2273420	2281180	And then she has a walking device, and she said she has it because her spine is collapsing.
2281180	2283180	This is a story that we want to hear.
2283180	2285780	Yeah, just sit at the edge of the stage.
2285780	2286780	Stand with her.
2286780	2287780	All right.
2287780	2288780	All right.
2288780	2289780	Let me get...
2289780	2290780	We're getting you a mic.
2290780	2291780	That looks great.
2291780	2292780	Are you comfortable there?
2292780	2293780	We're not making you do things that...
2293780	2294780	Okay.
2294980	2295980	What's your name?
2295980	2296980	Annie.
2296980	2297980	Annie.
2297980	2298980	Annie's spine is collapsing.
2298980	2299980	Thank you.
2299980	2300980	What does that mean?
2300980	2308900	So I have something called degenerative spinal stenosis, and what happened was in December,
2308900	2311060	I stopped being able to walk.
2311060	2312060	Jesus.
2312060	2313060	Yeah, that really sucked.
2313060	2314060	Like, how did that...
2314060	2315060	What was the...
2315060	2318820	Was there like an event where, like, that Stephen Hawking story where he's like walking
2318820	2319820	down the stairs?
2319820	2321340	There's just like one moment where you're like...
2321340	2322340	Yeah.
2322340	2323340	Well, I really wish it was more interesting.
2323340	2325300	I literally just, like, fell down in my hallway.
2325300	2327980	Like, I was carrying some laundry, and literally...
2327980	2329460	Stephen Hawking was just a stairwell.
2329460	2330860	You're just as interesting as him.
2330860	2331860	Okay, that's perfect.
2331860	2332860	I like that.
2332860	2334660	I like being as interesting as Stephen Hawking.
2334660	2337540	You're walking in your hallway, and then you just lost your ability to walk?
2337540	2338540	Literally.
2338540	2341540	And I was stuck there for a few hours, and I'm like...
2341540	2343180	Again, I was in so much pain I couldn't move.
2343180	2347420	I also have something called sciatica, and when I get it, I also can't walk.
2347420	2349460	So I was thinking that's what it was.
2349460	2350460	Right.
2350460	2353620	I had to crawl to a phone, which was really fun.
2353620	2354620	Like with your arms?
2354620	2355620	Like Stephen Seagal?
2355620	2356620	Totally, yeah.
2356620	2357620	It was like...
2357620	2358620	It was like Warzone without all the excitement.
2358620	2365180	Yeah, and then I went to the hospital, and I was in the hospital for a few weeks, and...
2365180	2368820	And they said, okay, this stenosis thing, which is a phrase I've heard, because...
2368820	2370700	You know that sound I make when I laugh?
2370700	2371700	Yes.
2371700	2373980	Wait, I can't...
2373980	2374980	They think that that's like...
2374980	2378620	It has something to do with cartilage getting thinner or something, right?
2378620	2381820	Well, in the back, what it does is it...
2381820	2382820	So old people get it...
2382820	2387460	You know how old people bend over as they get older, and they're leaning?
2387460	2390140	You see them on their walkers, and they look like they're all hunched.
2390140	2393820	That's actually because their spines are falling apart.
2393820	2394900	Because the cartilage...
2394900	2397700	Why am I getting so clinical?
2397700	2399180	What's the payoff of me understanding it?
2399180	2400180	I got it!
2400180	2401180	Good night!
2401180	2402180	Bones coming together.
2402180	2404780	But no, the important thing is the emotional side of it.
2404780	2405780	How old are you?
2405780	2406780	I'm 30.
2407220	2413260	So very young, even if you were 70, it's too young to find out one day that walking is
2413260	2414260	behind you.
2414260	2415260	No, totally.
2415260	2418900	And actually, they don't want to operate on me because I'm young, because they can fuck
2418900	2422220	that up, and that I would never be able to do anything ever again.
2422220	2424460	Meaning, I mean, what define anything...
2424460	2425460	I mean, like, they think they could...
2425460	2428980	Like, they could paralyze me with the surgery that I would need to correct this.
2428980	2431860	So now, what's the...
2431860	2432860	Is it the word prognosis?
2432860	2433860	Is that what...
2433860	2434860	Like, what's the...
2434860	2435860	What can you expect?
2435940	2437780	Well, I just...
2437780	2442460	I have to keep going to physical therapy, I have to keep using this beautiful thing,
2442460	2447820	and just, you know, and I take a lot of pain medication, I get a lot of injections into
2447820	2448820	my spine.
2448820	2449820	Oh, my God.
2449820	2450820	Is it going to get worse and worse?
2450820	2451820	Yeah, it's degenerative.
2451820	2453700	It's not going to get any better.
2453700	2454700	I can make the symptoms better.
2454700	2455700	Can I actually have a sip of this?
2455700	2456700	I'm sorry.
2456700	2457700	Yes, you can.
2457700	2461300	I was just going to tell you, Jordan's giving you a free account to Top Shelf when it's actually
2461300	2463500	working.
2463500	2464820	I would really need that, frankly.
2465060	2466060	It is the least we can do.
2466060	2467060	Thank you.
2467060	2470620	Now, I take a lot of medication, so I get dry mouth really easily, and now you're talking
2470620	2471620	to me, so I'm like, oh.
2471620	2472620	Oh, yeah.
2472620	2473620	Like that pill mouth.
2473620	2474620	Sorry, I misheard that.
2474620	2475620	It's hard to hear in here.
2475620	2479900	I thought you said, I take a lot of medication, so I can dry hump easily.
2479900	2480900	That's not what she said.
2480900	2481900	Also true.
2481900	2482900	No.
2482900	2488020	The doctors will not operate under their worry they could affect her ability to dry hump.
2488020	2489020	That's the last thing that...
2489020	2491020	That's the last thing I really want, you know?
2491020	2494260	I mean, if I couldn't dry hump anymore, I mean, life wouldn't be worth living, so...
2495140	2497260	You're an Asian dry hump fan?
2497260	2499260	You like your dry humping?
2499260	2501700	You know, I think it's underrated, definitely.
2501700	2503580	I think it is.
2503580	2505260	If you get a good dry hump, that's fucking...
2505260	2506260	That's a good night.
2506260	2507260	Absolutely.
2507260	2508260	That's a good evening.
2508260	2509260	Absolutely.
2509260	2510260	If you gotta be with somebody who knows how to dry hump you.
2510260	2514100	If you get a good dry hump, that can almost be better than good, like, oral sex, you know?
2514100	2515100	Like, it's...
2515100	2516100	I agree.
2516100	2520500	I think you're probably impressing people a lot with your radiance in the face of something
2520500	2523620	that a lot of people could use as an excuse to be a pretty crabby person.
2523620	2524620	Oh, well, thank you.
2524620	2525620	I tried.
2527620	2529620	It's all that dry humping.
2531620	2533620	I'd do my best not to be an asshole.
2533620	2540620	If there's anything we could do in the context of a show that otherwise has no direction anyway,
2540620	2544620	like, we would actually be thankful if you just gave us something to do.
2544620	2548620	Like, is there anything, some kind of fantasy...
2548620	2550620	On this, like, the podcast?
2550620	2553620	Yeah, yeah, like, I'm a master improviser.
2553620	2558620	I can create scene work, worlds within worlds.
2558620	2559620	Oh, man.
2559620	2564620	I'd almost love to say, like, I'd love to see you guys improvise, like, a character ship,
2564620	2566620	like, you know, like, creating fan fiction on...
2566620	2570620	Have you ever seen the, like, erotic fan fiction live thing that happens in LA?
2570620	2571620	No.
2572620	2573620	Oh, yeah.
2573620	2575620	Erotic fan fiction live?
2575620	2576620	Yeah, it's like a podcast thing.
2576620	2578620	It's somewhere not a meltdown.
2578620	2579620	They do it at a meltdown, I think.
2579620	2583620	So it's like somebody is, like, Scully and then someone's like Kirk and they just get on stage together?
2583620	2584620	Exactly.
2584620	2586620	It's like, and I think it's also competitive.
2586620	2589620	It's like competitive erotic fan fiction, like what this is.
2591620	2594620	I'd like to see you and Chris do a little erotic fan fiction.
2594620	2595620	Yeah, I think we can do that.
2595620	2597620	Yeah, I would totally love that.
2599620	2601620	And I think we should use your favorite characters.
2601620	2603620	Like, who do you want to see us do?
2603620	2605620	Oh, well, okay.
2605620	2608620	Okay, so obviously my favorite character...
2608620	2610620	I actually am in costume right now.
2610620	2612620	My favorite character is Annie.
2612620	2615620	Oh, your name is Annie and I was going to say you're kind of dressed like Annie.
2615620	2618620	Yes, it's true. It's sad, but true.
2618620	2621620	I have a blog, actually, about Annie's costumes.
2621620	2623620	It's literally Annie's clothes.
2623620	2625620	Have you had that for years and years?
2625620	2629620	No, I actually just recently started it because I've been cosplaying Annie for years and years.
2629620	2632620	What did you think about season five, Annie?
2632620	2634620	Oh, what did I think about season five?
2634620	2637620	I fucking hate pants and I want them to die.
2637620	2642620	I'm in such a difficult position there because I love Annie the way she always was,
2642620	2645620	but I also don't want to freeze her in time.
2645620	2649620	Tresses and cardigans. It's such a winning combination.
2649620	2652620	And now silk shirts? What the fuck, Dan?
2655620	2660620	I did a blog post of the whole season six promo that was just released,
2660620	2662620	the Age of Yahoo thing.
2662620	2664620	Almost every single frame is a silk shirt.
2664620	2666620	Do you know how hot silk shirts are?
2666620	2667620	Okay.
2667620	2668620	Ridiculous.
2668620	2675620	Well, first of all, I'll just say nobody was more pained than me to tell Annie to stop
2675620	2680620	dressing like the way that we met her, but I felt like I was liking it for the wrong reasons.
2680620	2687620	And so I felt like she was supposed to grow up because I would see people that were watching the show
2687620	2691620	and they're growing up with Annie and they're like, I didn't want her to continue to be like this thing.
2691620	2693620	But okay, so here's the thing.
2693620	2696620	Because your spine is collapsing and because you're a good person,
2696620	2700620	and because you like her for the right reasons,
2700620	2706620	now I have the excuse to say we have two episodes left to do for the finale.
2706620	2712620	Annie, she'll start wearing a mid, like above the knee floral.
2712620	2716620	Okay. Well, just tell it. Just dictate it and take it down and I'll go to wardrobe.
2716620	2721620	I love it. Yes. Yes.
2721620	2723620	We can do this. This is very easy.
2723620	2726620	They have a room full of clothes and you can just dictate.
2726620	2728620	I have a pad and paper and...
2728620	2730620	This is fans affecting change.
2730620	2735620	Yes. So, okay, from top to bottom, what do you want? Start with the hair, like fucking...
2735620	2740620	Actually, my only real request would be that I find out where you buy her clothes.
2740620	2745620	Like the big thing with cosplaying right now is buying the same things that they have on the show.
2745620	2746620	Right, right.
2746620	2748620	This is actually the same sweater she wore in this episode.
2748620	2750620	Oh, okay.
2750620	2752620	Well, we'll figure that out.
2752620	2756620	I'm sure wardrobe would love to honestly...
2756620	2761620	Like literally, just like nice dress, nice cardigan, you know, not too low cut.
2761620	2763620	She's not a whore. Like, come on.
2763620	2764620	Annie, Annie.
2764620	2766620	She wore a back brace, but, you know...
2766620	2769620	Annie, be specific. Like, give us a color so that when you watch that episode,
2769620	2771620	you know that you actually have the same...
2771620	2772620	Well, I think it should definitely be Yahoo Purple.
2772620	2773620	There should definitely be...
2774620	2775620	Yellow and purple.
2775620	2779620	A Yahoo Purple, you know, maybe a little Honda Blue, like something.
2779620	2781620	Like a...
2781620	2784620	Purple cardigan.
2784620	2785620	Purple cardigan.
2785620	2786620	Purple cardigan.
2786620	2787620	Floral dress.
2787620	2788620	Floral dress.
2788620	2790620	And flats.
2790620	2792620	Flats and tights, obviously.
2792620	2794620	Yeah, if so desired.
2794620	2795620	I mean, might as well.
2795620	2797620	I don't want to step on anyone's toes creatively.
2797620	2800620	Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't... I'm not going to stand in the way of...
2800620	2801620	No.
2801620	2806620	All right. Well, so you'll see the finale, and that's our...
2806620	2808620	This is like a dream come true.
2808620	2810620	You have to remember that.
2810620	2811620	You have to remember that.
2811620	2812620	That's right.
2812620	2815620	Chris has to remember that. I don't have to do anything.
2815620	2818620	I'll talk to you guys. I'll remind you.
2818620	2819620	That was very cool.
2819620	2821620	So we're all watching the finale of that season,
2821620	2823620	and we see Annie in purple and yellow.
2823620	2824620	It's because Annie here.
2824620	2828620	Yes, and because the real Annie, who gave everything...
2828620	2829620	I am so honored.
2830620	2832620	All right. Well, let's have a hand for Annie.
2832620	2833620	Thank you.
2835620	2836620	Thank you very much.
2836620	2838620	You're so sweet. Thank you.
2838620	2845620	I hope to God that when something bad starts happening to me,
2845620	2849620	I can start to become a good person miraculously.
2849620	2850620	What about Rebar?
2850620	2852620	What about Rebar? I don't know.
2852620	2853620	She knows about that.
2853620	2856620	We didn't want to corner her about Rebar at that moment.
2856620	2857620	There was another headline.
2857620	2858620	Aaron's here.
2858620	2860620	My wife. Aaron, get up here.
2863620	2864620	My wife.
2867620	2872620	From the day I married you, I made a choice.
2872620	2874620	Beep, beep, toot, toot.
2874620	2875620	Put your mama in the basket.
2875620	2876620	A little hungry in the chute.
2881620	2882620	Look at this dress.
2882620	2884620	You're like a creamsicle.
2884620	2886620	I thought you were going to say you look like a creep.
2887620	2888620	Like a creeper.
2888620	2889620	Minecraft.
2892620	2894620	A creamsicle?
2894620	2896620	Aren't creamsicles orange?
2896620	2897620	Sorry?
2897620	2898620	Are creamsicles green?
2899620	2901620	Creamsicles are green.
2901620	2902620	Sometimes.
2902620	2903620	Really?
2903620	2905620	They're the color of normal popsicles.
2905620	2906620	No, they're orange. I meant they're orange.
2906620	2908620	Sorry. I got a little distracted.
2908620	2910620	How is everybody doing?
2910620	2911620	Wait.
2911620	2912620	No.
2912620	2913620	Stop it.
2914620	2916620	Creamsicles are any color they need to be,
2916620	2918620	but they're defined by having cream in the middle of them.
2918620	2919620	He's a millennial.
2919620	2920620	I disagree.
2920620	2922620	I think creamsicles are orange with cream in the middle.
2922620	2924620	Are all creamsicles orange?
2925620	2926620	That's a very tepid response.
2926620	2930620	There's some cherry ones, but there's not any lime creamsicles.
2930620	2932620	Originally it was an orange and white affair,
2932620	2934620	but I think they might have added other flavors down the road.
2934620	2936620	But not green, though.
2936620	2938620	I've never seen a green creamsicle.
2938620	2939620	That's what I'm saying.
2939620	2940620	That's all I'm saying.
2941620	2942620	Okay.
2942620	2944620	They're orange.
2944620	2945620	All right. This guy.
2945620	2947620	Yeah. High five.
2947620	2949620	I came here in a petty cab.
2949620	2950620	Oh, yeah?
2950620	2952620	Because I couldn't get a ride out.
2952620	2955620	This guy's got a green creamsicle, motherfucker.
2958620	2959620	Creamsicle war.
2959620	2961620	But this looks like a kind of...
2961620	2962620	I don't know.
2962620	2964620	That looks like some black market shit.
2965620	2970620	I came here in a petty cab because I couldn't get a ride.
2970620	2973620	And the petty cab had to go across the bat bridge
2973620	2975620	while people were gathering to watch the bats,
2975620	2977620	and it was a nightmare,
2977620	2980620	because I felt like I was doing some weird performance art
2980620	2981620	because I was wearing this dress.
2981620	2982620	They're waiting for the bats,
2982620	2984620	but you're the only thing that they're getting.
2984620	2985620	Yeah, and the guy was like,
2985620	2986620	Excuse me, excuse me.
2986620	2990620	And then I heard, oh, princess, princess coming through.
2990620	2995620	And it got so bad that I started kind of like holding my leg.
2995620	2997620	Just to imply that maybe...
2997620	2999620	Yeah, that I was hurt.
2999620	3002620	Oh, what I wouldn't give for a collapsing spine.
3002620	3004620	Oh, yeah.
3004620	3006620	I'm kidding. She liked it. She got it.
3006620	3010620	By the way, a lot of Annie's clothes are from H&M.
3010620	3014620	Yes, and Forever 21, and more recently, J. Crew.
3014620	3015620	Oh, J. Crew.
3015620	3016620	Yeah.
3016620	3017620	But you don't like that stuff, the recent stuff.
3017620	3018620	No.
3018620	3020620	It's my fault. It's my fault.
3020620	3022620	I'm sorry.
3022620	3023620	Oh, man.
3023620	3025620	Hey, Cabs.
3025620	3028620	So you guys are all employees at Yahoo?
3028620	3030620	Cool.
3030620	3033620	I heard resounding yeses.
3033620	3035620	I know you're not. I'm just kidding.
3035620	3036620	If you want to...
3036620	3041620	Can we talk just about how hard it is to be married to me
3041620	3043620	while I'm working on the show so that Chris can feel...
3043620	3045620	Tell me about it.
3045620	3046620	Chris...
3047620	3049620	We're kind of both married to Dan, right?
3049620	3051620	Chris is on his second kid and...
3051620	3053620	Work wife.
3053620	3055620	Aw.
3055620	3056620	Our pilot.
3056620	3058620	I mean, it's like... I don't know.
3058620	3061620	It's a big theme of this year between me and Chris,
3061620	3064620	who are just running the show without any kind of like...
3064620	3067620	We're not like, oh, then there's that other guy that helps us,
3067620	3069620	and so we're just kind of like not home at all.
3069620	3070620	Yeah.
3070620	3074620	And I just wanted to uncork that entertainment fountain.
3075620	3080620	I assume it's the same as being married to like a sailor
3080620	3082620	who's off at sea.
3082620	3084620	It's very similar.
3084620	3086620	When you watch the show, are you going to be like...
3086620	3088620	Oh, I have not. I have not seen the show.
3088620	3090620	No, but I'm saying when you watch it,
3090620	3093620	it doesn't premiere until March 17th on Yahoo.
3093620	3098620	When you watch it, there's a syndrome that happens
3098620	3101620	where I haven't been home in three days,
3101620	3103620	and then I can either come home for the fourth day
3103620	3105620	or I can stay and try to make the show worth
3105620	3107620	not having been home for three days.
3107620	3110620	So... Because I keep picturing you watching the show
3110620	3112620	and going, huh.
3112620	3116620	That's exactly what goes through my mind all the time
3116620	3119620	when I miss my children's birthdays.
3119620	3121620	I go like, I want... I'm like,
3121620	3124620	oh, if she laughs a lot, then she'll forget.
3124620	3125620	Right?
3125620	3126620	Yeah.
3126620	3128620	Or when your son Charlie is in a flophouse
3128620	3130620	and someone's like, community's on.
3130620	3132620	He's like, yeah, yeah, it's real good, isn't it?
3132620	3134620	It's worth it, isn't it?
3134620	3136620	He's trying to hide his swastika tattoo.
3136620	3139620	Oh, look, they're doing a karate kid joke.
3139620	3140620	Great.
3140620	3142620	Well, he's getting like a Big Bang Theory tattoo
3142620	3144620	on his ass or something.
3146620	3148620	Yeah, Charlie McKenna is going to be
3148620	3151620	like the biggest Big Bang Theory fan in the world.
3151620	3153620	I doubt I'll watch it.
3153620	3156620	I was the biggest fan of World War II Japanese.
3156620	3159620	I doubt I'll watch it with a creative eye.
3159620	3161620	I'm sure I'll just be very supportive,
3161620	3163620	but I will say that a couple of days ago,
3163620	3164620	my dad and I were talking,
3164620	3166620	and the first thing that my...
3166620	3168620	It was after a string of you not being home
3168620	3170620	for four or five days,
3170620	3173620	and Chris, I don't want to belittle you not seeing your kids,
3173620	3177620	but we have two dogs, and...
3177620	3179620	No, that's more difficult than children.
3179620	3181620	I know. Thank you.
3181620	3182620	I'm just kidding.
3182620	3184620	Every time I feel sad that Dan's not there
3184620	3186620	to see the dogs grow up, I'm like,
3186620	3188620	oh, no, they're human beings.
3188620	3190620	I actually do.
3190620	3192620	I'm not doing it to be...
3192620	3194620	Well, I am doing it for exactly the reason.
3194620	3197620	Sometimes Aaron will send me the hostage pictures of the dog,
3197620	3199620	like the dogs are being cute,
3199620	3200620	and they're just sending him.
3200620	3203620	And I will just copy and paste a video of your kid
3203620	3205620	and put it back, but I am just...
3205620	3207620	It does make me feel better.
3207620	3210620	Yeah, his first time on the potty and stuff.
3210620	3212620	Because dogs never learn to talk.
3212620	3213620	It's harder.
3213620	3214620	It is.
3214620	3215620	Your kid's slowly becoming something
3215620	3217620	that can take care of himself.
3217620	3221620	What would you do if one of our dogs did manage to talk
3221620	3224620	and you weren't there for it?
3224620	3225620	Big deal.
3225620	3228620	I'd be sad.
3228620	3230620	Really quick, I was talking to my dad the other day,
3230620	3232620	and my dad's like, when is...
3232620	3233620	My dad is obsessed with Dan,
3233620	3235620	and he's like, when is community premiering?
3235620	3238620	And this is after, like, five days of you not being home,
3238620	3240620	and I'm like, can you just not talk about her right now?
3240620	3242620	I said, her.
3242620	3245620	She referred to the show as her.
3246620	3248620	You guys are checked out.
3252620	3254620	It is very loud.
3254620	3255620	Oh, you guys...
3255620	3257620	Wait, you guys can't hear?
3257620	3258620	Do we have anybody...
3258620	3261620	There's mingling happening at the bar.
3261620	3264620	The speakers are not pointed towards the frontest of rows
3264620	3266620	is probably the problem.
3266620	3267620	I'm up here just now.
3267620	3269620	I was having a great time.
3269620	3272620	I didn't know you couldn't hear me.
3272620	3274620	I was patting myself on the back for ignoring the sound.
3274620	3277620	It was like, yeah, I'm such a good performer,
3277620	3279620	because I'm supposed to care about that,
3279620	3281620	but they can't hear that.
3285620	3288620	I'm very, very excited about community,
3288620	3291620	and it's going to be great.
3291620	3294620	Do you guys see that Jeff has walked off stage and is now...
3294620	3297620	Murmur, murmur, murmur, murmur, murmur.
3297620	3299620	Grumble, grumble, grumble.
3299620	3303620	I got a treatment for a speck of a pilot of a thing.
3304620	3305620	I got a new app.
3305620	3308620	It's called Creepy Stone Guy On Stage.
3308620	3310620	I come into your podcast.
3310620	3313620	Who was it at South by Southwest
3313620	3315620	that said to another person at South by Southwest,
3315620	3318620	will you please meet me to talk business...
3318620	3319620	You can't hear shit back here.
3319620	3321620	...at the Harmontown show.
3323620	3324620	Here's where it is.
3324620	3325620	Hey, Dan, hi.
3325620	3327620	Here's what time it starts.
3327620	3329620	Dan, it's Jeff Davis, comptroller from Harmontown.
3329620	3331620	I'm reporting live from the back of the bar.
3331620	3334620	You can't hear shit back here.
3334620	3336620	It's very noisy back here, Dan.
3336620	3337620	Hey, Jeff, what's going on?
3337620	3341620	There's a lot of people going grumble, grumble, mumble, grumbles.
3341620	3342620	How you doing back here?
3342620	3343620	What's your name, miss?
3343620	3345620	You work here, right?
3345620	3347620	What's your name?
3347620	3348620	Stephanie.
3348620	3349620	Stephanie?
3349620	3350620	How old are you, Stephanie?
3350620	3351620	I'm not answering.
3351620	3352620	Fuck you, Stephanie.
3352620	3353620	I'm sorry.
3353620	3354620	I came on too hard.
3354620	3355620	I came on too hard.
3355620	3356620	You guys have no booze back here?
3356620	3357620	It's just beer and wine?
3357620	3358620	That's terrible.
3358620	3359620	That's the problem.
3359620	3362620	I got a top shelf booze in here and got everybody fucked up.
3362620	3365620	Guys, right now, drinks are on Stephanie.
3365620	3368620	Free one round on Stephanie, everybody.
3368620	3370620	A round of beer and wine.
3370620	3371620	It's an open bar.
3371620	3373620	It's an open bar?
3373620	3376620	Yeah, I think that's the problem.
3376620	3379620	Mumbling riffraffer mumbling in.
3379620	3380620	They got quiet.
3380620	3381620	It's not going to last long.
3381620	3387620	No, you push down on it like a cyst and it drains and then it fills back up.
3387620	3388620	They're having their cake and eating it too.
3388620	3390620	They're listening to the podcast kind of.
3390620	3391620	It's like cooking.
3391620	3396620	I don't mention it because I thought I would be being selfish by mentioning it because
3396620	3401620	from my last experience, I thought it's something that I can hear but that they can't hear.
3401620	3405620	I could talk about this all day.
3405620	3412620	Anyways, community is going to be bad and it's okay because I love you.
3412620	3415620	No, it's going to be great.
3415620	3417620	Dan, how are you going to make it up here?
3417620	3420620	When the community is done being written, what are you going to do to make it up all
3420620	3422620	the time that you've missed together?
3422620	3426620	Well, now that I have the I'm dressing Annie for Annie, I think I kind of like-
3426620	3427620	Can I make a request?
3427620	3430620	Can you come home for dinner once a year?
3430620	3431620	Is that okay?
3431620	3436620	On the finale of Community, can you hug me?
3436620	3437620	Fine.
3437620	3443620	Dan, will you also wear a purple cardigan and a yellow floral dress?
3444620	3447620	It's very funny.
3447620	3448620	Thank you.
3448620	3453620	What is your name and do you have a job that keeps you away?
3453620	3455620	Oh, wait.
3455620	3458620	Oh, hi, Jeremy.
3458620	3463620	I'm just giggling because he was answering earnestly.
3467620	3468620	Yeah, it's great.
3468620	3470620	He's doing great.
3471620	3475620	I can't imagine a world where I watch community looking for some reason why-
3475620	3477620	That's not- That's silly.
3477620	3478620	It's going to be great.
3478620	3479620	I mean, it's my favorite show.
3479620	3486620	I love how it's about just like friends playing pranks and there's the Asian guy that's a
3486620	3493620	ghost and there's the school girl who has a split personality.
3493620	3497620	It's sometimes a black woman and sometimes a blonde woman and it's just fascinating.
3497620	3498620	It's like no exit.
3498620	3501620	You're John Paul Sartre.
3501620	3507620	I tell her stuff about the show that you guys don't know.
3507620	3514620	The whole thing is taking place in a bag of Purell that at the end of it Bob Greenblatt
3514620	3517620	wipes his hands with it and goes, ew.
3517620	3518620	That's the finale.
3518620	3519620	Sorry.
3519620	3521620	Spoilers.
3521620	3522620	How do you feel about Purell?
3522620	3523620	Everybody on stage.
3523620	3527620	I feel like it doesn't belong in bags.
3528620	3529620	I don't believe in germs.
3529620	3531620	I don't like germaphobia.
3531620	3532620	I think it's silly.
3532620	3533620	Wait, what?
3533620	3535620	You don't believe in germs?
3535620	3539620	Well, I don't believe in making room for them in society.
3539620	3542620	I think that human beings are primates.
3542620	3544620	We've been here a really long time.
3544620	3546620	We were born into a world of germs.
3546620	3552620	We have them all over our body and when we disinfect each other and ourselves compulsively,
3552620	3557620	we're just moving sand around a beach and making a problem.
3557620	3562620	This is very interesting coming from the man who will only drink bottled water.
3562620	3567620	He even gave me the same speech when my five-month-old had the croup.
3567620	3568620	I heard she had the croup.
3568620	3570620	I wasn't there.
3570620	3576620	That's not the same as being scared of germs.
3576620	3578620	No, it's insane.
3578620	3579620	We're all constantly...
3579620	3582620	When you go into the bathroom and there's like...
3582620	3584620	I bet this doesn't happen in the women's room.
3584620	3593620	In the men's room, there's always a ragged, grody, threaded hand towel threaded through
3593620	3599620	the door handle by some jackass that was there before you who thought that he was the most
3599620	3602620	important person in the world and that you were a piece of filth.
3602620	3605620	He's not going to touch the bathroom door.
3605620	3606620	I don't understand what you mean.
3606620	3607620	The bathroom...
3607620	3608620	When you leave the men's room...
3608620	3609620	A stall door?
3609620	3612620	No, the bathroom door.
3612620	3618620	He doesn't care about his fucking gross napkin hanging and being on the floor.
3618620	3623620	The bathroom's a shit sty because people who are afraid of germs, they license themselves
3623620	3625620	to make everything disgusting and filthy.
3625620	3629620	There's like crap and piss everywhere because everyone's not sitting on the toilet seat
3629620	3631620	and spraying their gross poop everywhere.
3631620	3635620	So you put your fucking ass on the piece of plastic that you share with the person next
3635620	3637620	to you, they're not a monster.
3637620	3639620	You are a germ.
3639620	3641620	You're made of germs.
3641620	3644620	You're a blob of flesh and blood.
3644620	3645620	You crawl out of the ocean.
3645620	3646620	You carry it with you.
3646620	3653620	You're festooned with mites and lice and fucking micro bugs.
3653620	3657620	Grow up and get over yourself and share with others.
3657620	3663620	I don't mind germaphobia unless it's somebody's identity or personality when they make it
3663620	3664620	like a thing.
3664620	3665620	Yeah.
3665620	3666620	Yeah.
3666620	3669620	Yeah, no one wants to hang out with someone who's defined by their fear of anything, really.
3669620	3671620	I do have a problem, though.
3671620	3675620	I do spend a lot of time in bars and these guys don't wash their hands.
3675620	3677620	But the same guys, they see you.
3677620	3679620	They're like, hey, Jeff, and they're just determined to shake your hand.
3679620	3682620	I just saw you grab your dick and not wash your hands.
3682620	3684620	I don't want to shake your fucking hand.
3684620	3685620	That's gross.
3685620	3686620	Huh?
3686620	3688620	I'll touch your dick fine.
3688620	3690620	If you want him to touch your dick, he'll...
3691620	3693620	He's coming up to make you touch his dick.
3694620	3695620	Meet you, Annie.
3695620	3696620	We're going to dry hump.
3696620	3697620	We're going to touch your dick.
3697620	3698620	It's going to be great.
3700620	3701620	There's a human being here.
3701620	3703620	Should you come up here just to...
3704620	3705620	Because you probably...
3710620	3714620	So, Dan, talk about the creation of the human being.
3715620	3716620	I wasn't there for it.
3717620	3722620	I was always obsessed with the idea of race, believe it or not,
3722620	3727620	and the idea of racism being something that people want to avoid,
3727620	3732620	and then the idea of avoiding racism slowly becoming the most racist activity
3732620	3736620	you could ever engage in because you have to start actually talking about race
3736620	3738620	as if it's like this palette of paint.
3739620	3741620	And people are like, we have to...
3741620	3742620	Yeah, I don't know.
3742620	3743620	I was just always fascinated with it.
3744620	3745620	Oh, no.
3745620	3746620	Oh, nice.
3746620	3748620	Oh, he can't talk.
3748620	3753620	6,000 fan points for his refusal to speak.
3754620	3757620	Genuinely, genuinely afraid.
3758620	3759620	Well, it's supposed to...
3759620	3761620	That's the neat thing, isn't it?
3761620	3762620	Yeah, no, it is.
3762620	3764620	It's a neat thing, but it's effective.
3764620	3766620	It is really scary.
3766620	3769620	For those of you here tonight who haven't seen the show,
3769620	3773620	it's a really funny joke that I wrote once,
3773620	3775620	and it's funny.
3776620	3780620	It'd be funny if all these people talking were guerilla marketers for our community.
3780620	3783620	They're all going like, you gotta check out the show.
3783620	3785620	You know the show he's talking about?
3785620	3787620	What happened?
3787620	3788620	What happened?
3788620	3789620	Dial soap, dial soap.
3789620	3790620	Dial soap!
3790620	3791620	Who's that guy?
3791620	3792620	Get him!
3792620	3794620	My question about the people that are here at this bar...
3794620	3795620	They're flirting, they're having fun.
3795620	3798620	Is this their favorite bar, and they're just mad that a podcast is going on?
3798620	3801620	Oh, Ben Barr is their favorite bar.
3802620	3803620	Oh, yes.
3803620	3805620	They found an open bar, and they're not leaving.
3805620	3807620	I'm gonna go down to the pub, love.
3807620	3809620	I'll be back after a pint.
3809620	3810620	Oh, Ben!
3810620	3811620	Be careful, you know.
3811620	3813620	They're doing a podcast down there tonight.
3813620	3814620	Oh, love.
3814620	3815620	No, no, sweetheart.
3815620	3817620	You know how you get when you go down to the pub,
3817620	3819620	and there's a podcast going on.
3819620	3820620	You're in the back.
3820620	3821620	That's fine.
3821620	3822620	We can all live together.
3822620	3823620	I just want me pint.
3823620	3825620	Andy, no!
3825620	3827620	Don't forget your lanyard.
3832620	3833620	Oh, yes.
3833620	3835620	Forgot me lanyard.
3835620	3837620	Oh, a bit of the same, Miguel.
3837620	3839620	Oh, Andy, how you doing tonight, my friend?
3839620	3841620	Oh, good, Miguel.
3842620	3843620	Miguel?
3843620	3845620	I'm the Spanish-Scottish guy.
3846620	3848620	Oh, what's all this, then?
3848620	3850620	Oh, they're doing a podcast,
3850620	3855620	as they tend to do during Southby Southwest.
3856620	3857620	When will it end?
3857620	3859620	When could you stay Mr. Days?
3859620	3861620	You could just be a publican and have a bath,
3861620	3863620	and the people could come in and have a drink,
3863620	3866620	and there wouldn't have been any podcasting going on.
3867620	3868620	You know, sorry.
3868620	3871620	Sorry to cut off your improv there.
3871620	3874620	I feel like this guy probably doesn't watch Community.
3874620	3875620	Do you watch Community?
3875620	3877620	What was your favorite character?
3877620	3878620	I'm not allowed to say it.
3878620	3880620	This is a different guy than before.
3880620	3881620	I'm not saying this was the same guy.
3881620	3884620	I'm saying this is a guy who doesn't watch Community.
3884620	3886620	This is the podcast.
3886620	3889620	This is an insane turn.
3889620	3890620	Time out?
3890620	3892620	Okay, so I'll speak for the human being.
3892620	3893620	He's saying time out.
3893620	3894620	So are you a fan of Community?
3894620	3895620	I don't.
3895620	3896620	What?
3896620	3897620	No, come on.
3897620	3899620	We've got to let him whisper to you.
3899620	3900620	No, you can whisper.
3900620	3901620	You can whisper to me.
3901620	3902620	I mean...
3902620	3904620	I just feel like this would be...
3904620	3905620	Okay.
3906620	3909620	This would be the easiest way to murder us.
3911620	3914620	The human being's favorite character is Abbot.
3915620	3916620	Not a real character.
3916620	3917620	Not a real character.
3917620	3919620	You're just making that up.
3919620	3923620	Human being, can I translate your physical movement?
3923620	3925620	So Spencer, do you have a question for a human being?
3925620	3926620	Yeah.
3926620	3927620	Look towards me.
3927620	3928620	I'm your translator.
3928620	3930620	But don't look right at me.
3930620	3931620	Just like, look.
3933620	3934620	This is how I die.
3936620	3938620	I mean, he's not carrying any weapons.
3938620	3939620	We'd be able to tell.
3941620	3942620	Ouch.
3943620	3944620	All right.
3945620	3946620	You can see.
3948620	3950620	This is the podcast.
3951620	3954620	Human being, why is Abbot your favorite character?
3954620	3956620	Can you explain through movement to me?
3958620	3960620	Well, where do I begin?
3961620	3962620	Let's see.
3962620	3964620	How do I make this make sense?
3964620	3967620	Through a lot of time and squares.
3968620	3970620	Back in the beginning of...
3970620	3971620	Oh, angry.
3971620	3973620	Everybody else understands.
3974620	3979620	Talking, talking about the past and about our stories,
3979620	3980620	our personal...
3980620	3983620	Let's go back a little bit, Aaron, you dumb bitch.
3984620	3986620	Fuck you, Aaron.
3986620	3987620	I'm out.
3987620	3988620	No, I'm back.
3988620	3989620	All right.
3990620	3994620	Talking about TV.
3994620	3996620	I like how he talks about TV,
3996620	4001620	and he uses TV to reflect human interactions,
4001620	4003620	and it makes me feel more human.
4012620	4014620	You're going to die at midnight.
4017620	4020620	Let's have a hand for human being number seven.
4023620	4024620	Thank you, sir.
4024620	4025620	Human being.
4025620	4026620	Human being.
4028620	4033620	Do you think there's something to the idea of that box that he was miming,
4033620	4037620	the television, Abbot's proclivity or propensity
4037620	4040620	or need to study humanity through that lens,
4040620	4044620	the idea of separation, the idea of nylon fetishry,
4044620	4053620	the idea of the body being encased in a kind of coating of safe material?
4054620	4055620	I don't know.
4055620	4056620	Yes.
4056620	4060620	Tactile, like Squeeze Machines, Temple Grandin.
4060620	4062620	It's all coming together.
4062620	4064620	What's a Squeeze Machine?
4064620	4065620	Temple Grandin.
4065620	4068620	You haven't seen the Temple Grandin HBO movie?
4068620	4069620	What's Temple Grandin?
4069620	4070620	Oh, bro.
4070620	4073620	It's the best bar in Austin.
4073620	4075620	It is amazing.
4075620	4078620	You don't put a Temple Grandin on Rainy Street?
4078620	4080620	You don't have to talk to anybody.
4080620	4082620	You just go in and you get wrapped in gauze
4082620	4084620	and people pour drinks on you.
4084620	4086620	Temple Grandin is a human.
4086620	4088620	When you first go in there, they tell you you can't have a drink
4088620	4090620	because the drink you're ordering has never been heard of before,
4090620	4092620	but then people start to believe in you
4092620	4094620	because your brain just thinks different.
4094620	4098620	Temple Grandin changed the way that we treat animals and slaughterhouses
4098620	4099620	and did a lot.
4099620	4100620	Well, wait.
4100620	4102620	Didn't Upton Sinclair do that?
4102620	4104620	Well, in a way.
4104620	4106620	He just pointed it out and then he was like,
4106620	4107620	Goodbye!
4108620	4112620	Upton Sinclair was about protecting people from the health issues
4112620	4114620	and meat packing.
4114620	4116620	Temple Grandin actually was saying,
4116620	4120620	we are being enormously cruel to these animals
4120620	4122620	and it's costing us money.
4122620	4125620	It's a good thing we fixed all those problems.
4125620	4129620	She's a savant and an amazing genius who has done a lot.
4129620	4131620	Those balloons in the back are really cool.
4131620	4133620	They're like Dippin' Dots.
4133620	4138620	Dan Upton Sinclair, kind of like the Purell of the meat packing industry.
4138620	4140620	Didn't he kind of do away with germs?
4140620	4142620	Yeah, he was afraid of germs.
4142620	4144620	Some germs are bad when you're eating.
4144620	4146620	Oh, that's right.
4146620	4149620	You came down pretty hard on germ people earlier on.
4149620	4151620	I just mean the everyday.
4151620	4154620	If you're out and about and you die of a germ,
4154620	4156620	I'll give you a million dollars.
4158620	4160620	Does that include everything?
4161620	4163620	Go in the bathroom right now with a Q-tip.
4163620	4166620	Rub the Q-tip on any toilet seat.
4166620	4169620	Put it in a Petri dish and see what grows.
4169620	4172620	Then take the same Q-tip, well not the same one,
4172620	4175620	take a different Q-tip, rub it on your armpit,
4175620	4177620	rub that in a Petri dish.
4177620	4179620	Dan doesn't know about Ebola.
4179620	4181620	I know about Ebola.
4181620	4183620	It's not going to be in a toilet seat.
4183620	4188620	These things that kill you, they live inside liquid.
4189620	4192620	That's why in those sci-fi movies about everyone dying,
4192620	4194620	they have to go airborne.
4194620	4195620	It's a big thing.
4195620	4197620	All right, whatever you guys.
4197620	4198620	Be afraid.
4198620	4199620	Everyone be afraid.
4199620	4201620	See where it gets you.
4201620	4202620	Remember super volcanoes?
4202620	4204620	Remember that week?
4204620	4206620	There's a super volcano under Yellowstone.
4206620	4208620	Who gives a shit?
4208620	4210620	What are you going to die happy?
4210620	4212620	Dan, as somebody who shares a bed with you,
4212620	4216620	can I request that you don't lick anything out of a toilet seat
4216620	4218620	or that you take a little bit of care,
4218620	4220620	even if you don't believe in it?
4220620	4221620	Yes.
4221620	4223620	By the way, Dan and I share a couch.
4223620	4225620	I don't know what you're talking about.
4225620	4227620	Also, you got dressed together this morning
4227620	4229620	and you look great.
4229620	4231620	You look good.
4231620	4238620	All right, so do we play Shadowrun in a weird echoey barn?
4238620	4241620	We're going to have to play a high energy Shadowrun
4241620	4244620	to match the room tone in here.
4244620	4247620	I'm up in the air about this just as a producer of a podcast.
4247620	4250620	At the very least, they think we should hold off a bit.
4250620	4254620	Maybe get some raps out of the way.
4254620	4260620	And then do a big burst of role-playing that's really high energy.
4260620	4261620	Yeah.
4261620	4262620	All right, seriously.
4262620	4266620	All right, I'm going to do the best fucking rap.
4266620	4269620	It's not a joke.
4269620	4271620	I'm going to rap.
4271620	4272620	It's going to be the best rap.
4272620	4274620	Everyone's going to freak out.
4274620	4276620	But I can't think about it.
4276620	4278620	It's going to be so good because you're going to be like,
4278620	4280620	he didn't think about it?
4280620	4285620	Just empty your head and don't.
4285620	4286620	Dan?
4286620	4287620	All right.
4287620	4288620	A suggestion, Dan?
4288620	4289620	No, don't make a suggestion.
4289620	4291620	No, not a lyrical suggestion.
4291620	4293620	A physical suggestion that possibly,
4293620	4295620	like last time when you were rapping out in the street,
4295620	4296620	remember?
4296620	4297620	Yeah.
4297620	4299620	Maybe test how far the limits of this microphone.
4299620	4301620	Do we know how far the signal?
4301620	4303620	How far will that receiver go?
4303620	4305620	Okay, all right.
4305620	4306620	Just to the back of the seats?
4306620	4308620	Oh, we have someone that knows that kind of thing.
4308620	4309620	Yeah.
4309620	4310620	We'll see.
4310620	4311620	All right, Dan?
4311620	4312620	We'll see.
4312620	4314620	Are you ready, Dan?
4318620	4323620	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
4323620	4325620	I got the flow in the science.
4325620	4328620	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
4328620	4331620	Get ready for the best rap Dan Harmon has ever done.
4331620	4332620	Yeah.
4332620	4333620	Yeah.
4333620	4334620	Yeah.
4334620	4336620	2015 South by Southwest, Austin, Texas.
4336620	4338620	Storm clouds, lightning, rain.
4338620	4340620	I fucked your mama until I felt the pain.
4340620	4342620	I walked the streets.
4342620	4343620	I saw your dad.
4343620	4345620	He said, fucked your mama and it wasn't bad.
4345620	4348620	He said, you and I, we should be friends.
4348620	4352620	We can be friends until the end because we both fucked your mama
4352620	4353620	and she's my wife.
4353620	4356620	So now I fuck your mama all my life.
4356620	4359620	And we, we're both married to your mom.
4359620	4362620	I'm talking about Major Tom level sci-fi.
4362620	4364620	Blast it off into the space.
4364620	4367620	Fuck your mama in her eye and everything on her face.
4367620	4369620	That sounded gross.
4369620	4371620	I'm so sorry.
4376620	4380620	Yo, yo, my name is Kevin Johnson.
4380620	4384620	I am a different character.
4384620	4386620	What the fuck?
4386620	4389620	Get the fuck out of here.
4389620	4392620	Yo, I'm Kevin Johnson.
4392620	4394620	What?
4394620	4398620	Strange development.
4398620	4401620	My name is Kevin Johnson and I'm here to say,
4401620	4404620	every rap that I do is in a Kevin way.
4404620	4407620	I go hip to the hop to the Kevin to the tip.
4407620	4411620	I fucked your mama from her nose to her lip.
4411620	4416620	Kevin Johnson, not much different, just a lower octave.
4416620	4419620	Get out of here.
4419620	4425620	Austin style, Texas, sand, cactus, big land.
4425620	4428620	Houston suck my dick.
4428620	4433620	Yeah, don't have to rhyme when they applaud.
4433620	4436620	Houston can suck my dick.
4436620	4438620	Dallas, fuck you.
4438620	4441620	You're just a TV show.
4441620	4446620	I fucked your mama so hard, she enjoyed it.
4446620	4448620	We're dating now.
4448620	4451620	We're committed.
4451620	4452620	I truly love her.
4452620	4454620	I'm committed to her.
4454620	4455620	It's going beyond sexuality.
4455620	4457620	I don't even care anymore.
4457620	4462620	I consider your mama a fucking partner in my life.
4462620	4464620	If she got sick, I would never leave.
4464620	4467620	I fucked your mama so hard,
4467620	4469620	I would never leave her.
4469620	4472620	She's my partner.
4472620	4475620	Sometimes she goes to the bathroom at an airport
4475620	4477620	and I look at her photo.
4477620	4479620	I miss her so much.
4479620	4483620	I fucking love your mama.
4483620	4487620	I would spend my life fucking here.
4487620	4493620	Dan Harmon, everybody.
4493620	4495620	Thank you.
4495620	4497620	I'm not going to look back at the standing O.
4497620	4499620	I don't even...
4499620	4502620	Oh, shit.
4502620	4504620	They sat quickly.
4504620	4505620	That was great.
4505620	4510620	Yeah.
4510620	4513620	I know I've graduated physically to a new thing
4513620	4515620	where I don't bother to try to...
4515620	4517620	Did everyone notice that?
4517620	4521620	I used to go like that, but now I'm just slowly...
4521620	4523620	I go like this.
4523620	4525620	I have a toddler.
4525620	4527620	I recognize it.
4527620	4533620	As you get older, you start to treat your ledges like big stairs.
4533620	4536620	Because it's the way to preserve your dignity.
4536620	4540620	Because if I were to go into committing to it being a thing,
4540620	4543620	I would be like, then I would go like this.
4543620	4546620	And then I'd be like, I can't.
4546620	4549620	I'm just going to do it Louis Anderson style now.
4549620	4554620	I like that it's only at that moment that you chose to preserve your dignity for us.
4554620	4556620	Yeah, thank you.
4556620	4558620	Well, I mean, these things go on in your head.
4558620	4561620	They don't reflect reality.
4561620	4563620	Pretty nice set.
4563620	4565620	Dan, do you want to stand up for our set riffing?
4565620	4567620	Do you want to riff the set for us?
4567620	4570620	I want to take advantage of the set with a good musical cue.
4570620	4572620	Aaron, clear their sight lines.
4572620	4573620	Okay.
4573620	4574620	Here we go.
4574620	4575620	You want to rap me?
4575620	4576620	What do you want to hear?
4576620	4578620	Something dramatic and sci-fi.
4578620	4579620	Sci-fi?
4579620	4580620	All right.
4580620	4581620	How about...
4598620	4602620	From the beginning of the Quantum Cosmos,
4602620	4608620	entertainment has subsisted on one wavelength alone.
4608620	4616620	The division between entertainer and the entertained.
4616620	4622620	Now that barrier is shattered with a new show.
4622620	4627620	One reaching into your mind, making you part of the wonderment.
4627620	4631620	That's not really going anywhere.
4632620	4633620	All right.
4640620	4643620	You are losing your craving for cigarettes.
4646620	4650620	You are thinking about stepping outside for a smoke.
4651620	4654620	This device has no power over you.
4654620	4658620	You are a sexual, assertive being.
4658620	4660620	Your board meeting is going to go well.
4660620	4666620	Whether or not you eat the bagel, you can be thin.
4666620	4669620	You can be decisive.
4669620	4671620	You can run a company.
4671620	4674620	You just aren't yet.
4674620	4676620	Don't smoke.
4676620	4678620	Stop eating.
4678620	4681620	Skip the ranch.
4681620	4684620	Seize the day.
4689620	4692620	I thought that was building.
4692620	4697620	Futuristic weight loss, anti-smoking guy.
4697620	4698620	You are right.
4698620	4701620	That was entertainment.
4701620	4704620	I think four people went out to get a smoke during that.
4704620	4706620	I made them think about it.
4706620	4707620	I thought about it.
4707620	4710620	I quit smoking when I was 32.
4710620	4711620	Remember smoking?
4711620	4713620	Who smokes here?
4713620	4715620	Yay.
4716620	4718620	Oh, yeah?
4718620	4719620	Oh, yeah.
4719620	4722620	We took a photo together earlier in the day.
4726620	4730620	I think it was in your other hand.
4730620	4733620	He is just trying to play to the crowd.
4733620	4734620	No, you are cool, man.
4734620	4735620	He is cool.
4735620	4737620	Everyone give him stuff.
4738620	4739620	All right.
4739620	4741620	What is the thing you can do with this many people that you can't do?
4741620	4743620	Let's play duck, duck, goose.
4745620	4749620	Some people want to play duck, duck, goose.
4749620	4752620	It is the worst game ever made.
4752620	4756620	I want to see if you could crowd surf all the way down one row
4756620	4759620	and then all the way back up the other side.
4759620	4762620	No, we can't crowd surf.
4762620	4765620	Not with that attitude, you can't.
4765620	4768620	You could conduct an orchestra you could assign.
4768620	4770620	You could do that summer camp thing.
4770620	4772620	That is what I was thinking.
4772620	4776620	You guys are really into snickers, but you guys are really into Doritos.
4778620	4780620	I don't know.
4780620	4782620	Not unless they pay us.
4784620	4787620	We have got to figure out an ending point
4787620	4792620	so we can move on with our celebration of community.
4794620	4796620	We are moments away from playing Shadowrun.
4796620	4798620	I know, but...
4799620	4803620	We have to commit to making it a high energy chapter of Shadowrun.
4803620	4806620	Last time I think we got in the car and went to a thing.
4806620	4808620	We didn't do shit.
4808620	4810620	I mean, you did... I don't know.
4810620	4812620	Let's not dwell on the past.
4812620	4814620	It is true.
4814620	4817620	This is an action set piece for playing Shadowrun
4817620	4820620	because we just pulled away from the...
4820620	4822620	I don't want to tell Spencer's business.
4822620	4824620	What are we talking about?
4825620	4830620	There is a lot of competition from the infusion bar.
4830620	4833620	Why don't you guys sell drinks?
4833620	4836620	I just don't think the shushing helps.
4836620	4838620	I appreciate the sentiment.
4838620	4841620	It just doesn't seem effective is the only thing.
4841620	4842620	It is okay.
4842620	4843620	What is your name?
4843620	4846620	Jessica has volunteered to go over to the bar and yell at people.
4846620	4848620	Let's hear it for Jessica.
4854620	4856620	Jessica! Jessica!
4856620	4858620	Jessica! Jessica!
4858620	4860620	Jessica! Jessica!
4860620	4863620	Jessica is circling around back.
4869620	4871620	I don't want to be a defeatist,
4871620	4874620	but I want to point out that this is why our show had low ratings,
4874620	4876620	just because you are always hearing from the person
4876620	4880620	that is telling you to take it more seriously.
4881620	4884620	Parks and Rec, you can just hang out, talk and watch it.
4884620	4888620	Hey, I'd like a drink and I love Parks and Rec.
4888620	4891620	And then it is like, no, shut up, listen.
4891620	4893620	Fuck you.
4893620	4895620	Flip.
4896620	4898620	All right.
4899620	4902620	Jessica, don't give up yet. You are doing good.
4902620	4905620	You have a look. You have done good.
4905620	4907620	Jessica.
4907620	4909620	Jessica! Jessica!
4909620	4912620	Jessica! Jessica! Jessica!
4912620	4914620	Jessica! Jessica!
4914620	4916620	Get over there, Jessica. Make some enemies.
4916620	4918620	Make people upset with you.
4918620	4921620	She's got help. We have another woman coming to help her.
4924620	4927620	Hey, Dan, why don't we all go to the bar and do the show over there?
4927620	4929620	Why don't we all take everybody over to the bar
4929620	4931620	and we'll just all go to the bar.
4931620	4933620	I would think that they would come over here and talk.
4934620	4938620	And he goes up like, guys, do you mind? Really?
4938620	4940620	I think that...
4940620	4944620	My spine and my enthusiasm is collapsing right now.
4944620	4949620	I think the thing to do would be the opposite of telling them not to talk.
4949620	4955620	The thing to do would probably go down there and tell them to talk.
4955620	4957620	Okay.
4957620	4959620	Okay. All right.
4959620	4966620	Welcome to Secrets and Lies featuring the people of the bar.
4966620	4969620	Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
4969620	4972620	Hi, gentlemen. Hey, are you guys talking about apps?
4972620	4973620	We are.
4973620	4975620	You are? What kind of apps do you have?
4975620	4979620	Well, we're about to Instagram a picture of all y'all on the stage.
4979620	4984620	Great. Great. Keep it down. Hi. Hi. How you doing?
4984620	4988620	You look like you're in a rock band. Are you in a rock band?
4988620	4989620	Yeah, actually I am.
4989620	4991620	What's the name of your band?
4991620	4993620	Yeah, the Funk Master.
4993620	4996620	Cool. Keep it down. All right.
4996620	5000620	Hi, you guys. I think that covers it. Wait.
5000620	5002620	Where's the rumbling? There's one on the back here.
5002620	5004620	Hey, hey, hey. Where are your kids?
5004620	5005620	I don't have kids.
5005620	5008620	Well, exactly. I don't know. Keep it down.
5008620	5011620	You guys are doing great. You're beautiful. Beautiful.
5011620	5013620	I don't know. I don't know if that worked.
5013620	5018620	But you at any time could be on the show bar time.
5018620	5019620	All right.
5019620	5020620	All right.
5020620	5024620	I mean, I think it works, but it's going to, it's going to,
5024620	5026620	the half-life of that working.
5026620	5027620	What was the way that you got up?
5027620	5028620	Yeah, yeah.
5028620	5030620	Well, I have to fill that time position.
5030620	5034620	Oh, no. Oh, no.
5034620	5038620	And I can't bend down to help her.
5038620	5041620	Dry hump. Dry hump opportunity.
5041620	5044620	Oh, I'm up. Thank you. All right.
5044620	5047620	Good job, baby. All right.
5047620	5050620	We've cleared, now that we've gotten that kind of silence,
5050620	5055620	let's earn it with our 9-11 song.
5055620	5059620	Oh, God.
5059620	5061620	I think I just made it worse.
5061620	5063620	Maybe I was a little me in another.
5063620	5064620	What the fuck was that?
5064620	5066620	If you're talking during this, then you're glad 9-11 happened.
5066620	5069620	It's okay. It's okay. They're having a good time.
5069620	5070620	They're having a good time.
5070620	5072620	Because I'm singing a 9-11 song.
5072620	5074620	I'm just saying.
5080620	5084620	Don't come down.
5084620	5088620	Stay up.
5088620	5094620	Stay towers.
5094620	5102620	Why can't it be 9-10 again?
5102620	5111620	Why did it ever be 9-11?
5111620	5120620	Freedom, speech, terrors, reach.
5120620	5128620	Pakistan must be behind this.
5128620	5135620	Foreign strife, liberated life.
5135620	5140620	I'm calling to you, but I can't hear your name.
5140620	5146620	9-9-11.
5146620	5155620	Why can't it be 9-10 again?
5155620	5159620	9-11.
5159620	5168620	When will you be 9-11-12?
5168620	5177620	When will life stop being 9-11?
5177620	5185620	Freedom, I saw your party in the sunlight.
5185620	5192620	I saw you, but you couldn't reach my hand.
5192620	5194620	Dan, is this going to go on for a long time?
5194620	5196620	Because I don't want to be on stage for this.
5196620	5201620	I do not like this.
5201620	5210620	Evil, get back in the zone.
5210620	5221620	Yes, space, space, space, space, rocket.
5221620	5239620	9-11, vaccinations, leukemia, cancer, AIDS, 9-11.
5239620	5243620	Don't talk during this.
5243620	5248620	It sends a message to your children.
5248620	5258620	What will we leave behind if we talk during the 9-11 segment of a show?
5258620	5263620	What will we change and will we grow?
5263620	5267620	I want to touch God's body.
5267620	5272620	I want to be Trent Reznor.
5272620	5275620	I want to touch your body.
5275620	5282620	I want to name your 11.
5282620	5291620	What if we're all animals inside?
5291620	5297620	What if Jesus opened wide?
5297620	5300620	Offensive things are good.
5300620	5305620	Offensive things are hot.
5305620	5308620	I want to name your 11.
5308620	5318620	I want to name your heart 9-11.
5318620	5338620	Vaccines, all chisel 9-11, all chisel 9-11.
5338620	5345620	Should we do...
5345620	5349620	Thanks, guys.
5349620	5351620	I love it.
5351620	5356620	You wouldn't have thought so hard to prove me wrong if I hadn't said anything.
5356620	5363620	That is a 37% standing ovation.
5364620	5367620	That's the 37% that's going to keep us on the air, buddy.
5367620	5373620	Or that's the 30% of our audience that can hear what we're doing up here.
5373620	5376620	This is pockets of weird acoustics.
5376620	5381620	I would have preferred if everyone had stood up just 37%.
5381620	5383620	Can you guys do that right now?
5383620	5388620	Standing prouch.
5388620	5390620	There we go.
5390620	5393620	That was easily 60-plus percent.
5393620	5396620	Did you say, Dan, at one point that you want to touch God's pony?
5396620	5398620	His body.
5398620	5399620	What do you think I said?
5399620	5403620	At least you want to touch God's pony.
5403620	5405620	That's cute. That's good.
5405620	5408620	How do you nine someone's 11?
5408620	5413620	I know that you want a 9-11, but physically what is the procedure?
5413620	5416620	And now the suits come out and they want their explanations
5416620	5421620	and they want their affidavits, but it's fucking art.
5421620	5423620	You don't explain it.
5423620	5427620	You spit it and you move on, or else people die.
5427620	5432620	I don't know what it means, grandpa.
5432620	5435620	I'm just saying, before I sign up for having my 11-9,
5435620	5438620	I want to know exactly what I'm signing up for.
5438620	5441620	You'll know.
5441620	5443620	You'll know what's going to happen tonight.
5443620	5445620	Can you 11 a 9?
5445620	5448620	Can you go backwards and reverse engineer?
5448620	5449620	Yes.
5449620	5451620	I'm going to 11 your 9 tonight.
5451620	5454620	That's how that song was released in Europe.
5454620	5457620	They just get confused because it's not that.
5457620	5460620	They would call September 11, 11-9.
5460620	5462620	Oh, that's right. They would have.
5462620	5465620	No one's ever talked about that.
5465620	5469620	They must be so confused on November 9.
5469620	5472620	They seem to be just hanging out.
5472620	5476620	Apparently not that big a deal to them.
5476620	5482620	On 9-11, is there visual celebrations that Europeans would see?
5482620	5483620	Yeah.
5483620	5488620	Everyone's like, yeah, the towers fall again.
5488620	5492620	I thought I was great.
5492620	5494620	Now, is that you doing Trent Reznor or Jim Morrison?
5494620	5496620	It was kind of somewhere in between.
5496620	5499620	I don't know what it was, but it came through me and it was fucking amazing.
5500620	5504620	Have we ever had standing ovations during a show before?
5504620	5506620	I don't know that we have.
5506620	5513620	Unless you count the Oscars that I won an Emmy for, that got a standing ovation.
5513620	5515620	It was at the Bell House.
5515620	5517620	That wasn't really me performing.
5517620	5520620	That was Hugh Jackman doing what I wrote.
5520620	5524620	Sean Penn stood up and he doesn't even like the country.
5524620	5526620	It kind of found his joy.
5526620	5531620	Spencer, let's play some badass high action shadow.
5531620	5532620	You have a question, sir?
5532620	5533620	Hang on.
5533620	5534620	Come on.
5534620	5535620	What's up?
5535620	5536620	What's up?
5536620	5537620	I'm sorry about you.
5537620	5539620	You brought up Sean Penn.
5539620	5540620	You brought up Sean Penn.
5540620	5544620	I'm Mexican, so I really want to know what you thought of what he said during the Oscars.
5544620	5549620	And furthermore, I would like to know what you think about drug dealing in Mexico.
5549620	5554620	That guy's Mexican and he wanted to know...
5554620	5555620	What did Sean Penn say?
5555620	5557620	Are you talking about the...
5557620	5562620	He said he made the joke about the guy doesn't have a green card or something like that?
5562620	5564620	He was just joking, right?
5564620	5565620	He was just...
5565620	5566620	I think they were just pals.
5566620	5568620	Do you want to come up here and talk about it?
5568620	5569620	No.
5569620	5570620	Because you can.
5570620	5573620	Mexican Hermenian!
5573620	5576620	You didn't even do the knee crawl.
5576620	5579620	He just stood right up.
5579620	5581620	I didn't see that part of the Oscars.
5581620	5583620	So Sean Penn made a joke.
5583620	5586620	You didn't see the last award, the best movie award?
5586620	5587620	I wasn't up for anything.
5587620	5589620	Fair enough, fair enough.
5589620	5592620	Sean Penn, did you just make an offhand joke or was he being political?
5592620	5594620	Well, I think it was an offhand joke.
5594620	5598620	But there was so much debate on Twitter that he was super racist and whatever.
5598620	5600620	He was just like, who gave this guy a green card?
5600620	5601620	It's similar to me.
5601620	5605620	I think he even knows the guy and he was making a joke about how hard we are on immigration.
5605620	5607620	He's like, yeah, this guy doesn't even have a green card.
5607620	5609620	I think he was making...
5609620	5611620	He was being ironic, right?
5611620	5614620	He was doing a bit like he was doing his impression of a conservative.
5614620	5618620	Remember when we forgave him for beating the shit out of Madonna?
5618620	5620620	What's that?
5620620	5622620	I don't know about that.
5622620	5623620	I'm not sure about that, but...
5623620	5624620	What was your name?
5624620	5625620	Sorry, I didn't get your name.
5625620	5626620	Eric.
5626620	5628620	We've met three times.
5628620	5630620	Where's your green card?
5630620	5641620	Actually, last time I asked you about your advice on me trying to get a green card so
5641620	5645620	I could stay here and work, you said, you know, sometimes you'll just have to admit
5645620	5650620	that maybe you'll die under a bridge, but you'll die doing what you love.
5650620	5651620	That's what you said to me.
5651620	5652620	Yes.
5652620	5653620	Yeah.
5653620	5654620	That's true.
5654620	5655620	I think you kind of...
5655620	5656620	Eric, everybody.
5656620	5658620	Eric, thank you so much, sir.
5659620	5660620	All right.
5660620	5662620	Eric, Eric, Eric, the Mexican.
5662620	5664620	Is that politically incorrect?
5664620	5666620	It's a nationality.
5666620	5668620	Muchas gracias.
5668620	5669620	All right.
5669620	5670620	Spencer.
5670620	5672620	Do we have our character sheets?
5672620	5673620	Oh, I got them.
5673620	5675620	Or should we just freestyle without it?
5675620	5677620	Should we just go like from the hip?
5677620	5678620	No, no.
5678620	5680620	We'll do it by the books.
5680620	5681620	Okay.
5681620	5686620	By the way, what I meant was you got to imagine yourself dying under a bridge doing what you
5686620	5692620	love, and if that's okay with you, then you should keep doing what you're doing.
5692620	5699620	Dan, have you ever had fantasies about being in a band or fronting a band?
5699620	5702620	You being in...about me in a band?
5702620	5703620	Yes.
5703620	5706620	Have you ever had a fantasy about being in a band?
5706620	5707620	Sorry.
5707620	5710620	What these people at the bar don't know is that they're really going to be missing out
5710620	5714620	on four people playing a role-playing game.
5715620	5718620	It's entertainment dynamites.
5718620	5721620	We're going to make it amazing, though.
5721620	5723620	It's a jungle over there.
5723620	5724620	All right.
5724620	5725620	Spencer, are you good to go on this?
5725620	5726620	Sure.
5726620	5727620	Yeah.
5727620	5728620	All right.
5728620	5731620	I guess Chris is going to be playing Dr. Friend, I imagine?
5731620	5732620	Yeah.
5732620	5733620	Chris is playing Dr. Friend.
5733620	5734620	All right.
5734620	5743620	You guys ready for some fucking hard ass take note prisoners futuristic RPG bullshit Austin, Texas style?
5743620	5745620	All right.
5745620	5748620	Spencer, if you would, would you please get us up to speed?
5748620	5749620	Yeah.
5749620	5751620	It's just bursting through.
5751620	5757620	Today's Harman Town recap was brought to you by Twitter user Let'sBeSapid.
5757620	5764620	Last time on Harman Town Shadow Run, our heroes continued their quest to capture Baldwin Brown
5764620	5772620	as they drove their truck full of BTL chips to a small wooden house led by Eve Spirit Eagle.
5772620	5779620	Upon arrival, Eve's attempt to astrally project into the house was thwarted by a strong mana barrier.
5779620	5787620	The fearless Jim Nightblade, the charming Mercy O'Donnell, and foreign Hordegard took matters into their own hands.
5787620	5793620	The threesome infiltrated the rickety old house only to be met with a rickety old woman.
5793620	5800620	Hordegard distracted the woman as Mercy and Nightblade entered the basement to find two sleeping figures.
5800620	5806620	Meanwhile, back at the truck, Eve and Dr. Friends explored their real feelings for each other
5806620	5811620	and shared a tender kiss while the Johnson sat by awkwardly.
5811620	5814620	Will our gang find Baldwin Brown?
5814620	5817620	Will Hordegard enjoy coffee with the old woman?
5817620	5821620	What will happen to Eve and Dr. Friends' budding relationship?
5821620	5825620	Find out on Harman Run Shadow Town.
5825620	5829620	All right.
5829620	5835620	So again, just to give credit where credit's due, a guy on Twitter named LetsMeSapid wrote that for me.
5835620	5837620	So I didn't write it.
5837620	5840620	So that's a new thing if you can write a Shadow Run recap.
5840620	5846620	Yeah, if you want to write a Shadow Run recap and it's good, I'll read it because it's extra work that I won't have to do.
5846620	5848620	That's great. That's awesome.
5848620	5850620	Yeah, fantastic.
5850620	5851620	All right.
5851620	5852620	All right, so who's in the house right now?
5852620	5857620	So right now we have Jim Nightblade and Mercy in the house, as well as Hordegard, who doesn't exist.
5857620	5862620	So Jim Nightblade and Mercy O'Donnell are downstairs in the basement.
5862620	5868620	They're peering into a darkened room where two sleeping figures appear to be sleeping.
5868620	5872620	Meanwhile, Eve and Friend are in the truck outside of the house.
5872620	5873620	Who am I with?
5873620	5877620	You're with Jeff Davis, Eve.
5878620	5883620	I get on the comm link and I say, Mercy, Nightblade, what's going on in the house?
5883620	5885620	Give me the situation.
5885620	5888620	All right, we got two dozers underground.
5888620	5893620	We haven't discussed what to do yet, but I think we should calmly rouse them.
5893620	5897620	I'm going to take a closer look at them.
5897620	5899620	Okay.
5899620	5901620	You take a closer look at them.
5901620	5903620	They don't seem to be moving.
5903620	5910620	Just see, it looks kind of like just these still figures next to each other in bed, almost like rows of dirt.
5910620	5913620	Okay, I blow really hard in their faces.
5913620	5915620	Okay.
5915620	5918620	They wake up with a start.
5918620	5921620	What?
5921620	5923620	They start screaming.
5923620	5924620	They're screaming.
5924620	5925620	I stun them.
5925620	5926620	I stun baton.
5926620	5927620	All right.
5927620	5929620	What's your clubs plus agility?
5929620	5930620	God damn it.
5930620	5931620	You can't.
5931620	5933620	What do they look like, Spencer?
5933620	5937620	They look like an old balding man and a young goatee wearing boy.
5937620	5939620	I mean, not boy, teenager.
5939620	5940620	I don't know.
5940620	5941620	Interesting.
5941620	5943620	Say again, a teenager with a what?
5943620	5947620	20-year-old guy with a goatee and a balding man.
5947620	5948620	It's fucking bald one.
5948620	5949620	God damn it.
5949620	5950620	What?
5950620	5951620	Do they look healthy?
5951620	5953620	Clubs three, unarmed three, is that what you want?
5953620	5955620	No, agility is the other one.
5955620	5956620	Agility five.
5956620	5957620	That's five, right?
5957620	5958620	Yeah, okay.
5958620	5959620	Hit him.
5959620	5962620	We're in the thing.
5962620	5965620	But he doesn't seem to be bothered by it.
5965620	5966620	He's just sleepy.
5966620	5967620	He's getting stunned.
5967620	5969620	He's like, oh, my God.
5969620	5970620	Jesus Christ.
5970620	5973620	Is it bald one brown?
5973620	5974620	Yeah.
5974620	5975620	Gentlemen, okay.
5975620	5981620	I'm going to use con.
5981620	5982620	Okay.
5982620	5987620	Gentlemen, we've been sent here by Brian McMahon.
5987620	5989620	What's his name?
5989620	5990620	What?
5990620	5991620	Baldwin Brown.
5991620	5992620	Baldwin Brown.
5992620	5995620	We've been sent here by Baldwin Brown, but we can't find him.
5995620	5996620	Can you tell us where he is?
5996620	5999620	That's me, and you're never going to catch me alive.
5999620	6000620	Drone.
6000620	6001620	Attack.
6001620	6002620	Attack.
6002620	6003620	Drone.
6003620	6004620	Attack.
6004620	6005620	Okay.
6005620	6006620	So is the young guy a drone?
6006620	6007620	What?
6007620	6008620	The old man's a drone.
6008620	6009620	No.
6009620	6010620	Who is talking?
6010620	6011620	The old man.
6011620	6012620	The old man.
6012620	6013620	Baldwin Brown is the guy you're talking to.
6013620	6014620	Yeah.
6014620	6015620	I just realized.
6015620	6016620	Did we all know that?
6016620	6021620	You see a metallic sphere float up into the air.
6021620	6023620	It must be this drone.
6023620	6029620	It turns a turret towards you, Mercy, and it fires several bullets.
6029620	6030620	Uh-oh.
6030620	6032620	Oh, but you dodge.
6032620	6038620	You dodge nimbly out of the way of the drone.
6038620	6041620	I run out of the room.
6041620	6042620	Okay.
6042620	6043620	You run out of the room.
6043620	6044620	Right.
6044620	6046620	Leaving Nightblade alone.
6046620	6047620	Can I shoot it?
6047620	6048620	The drone?
6048620	6049620	Yeah.
6049620	6050620	Yeah.
6050620	6053620	What's your pistols plus agility?
6053620	6057620	Pistols is two plus two.
6057620	6059620	Agility is five.
6059620	6060620	All right.
6060620	6063620	You hit the drone, and you pierce its...
6063620	6064620	What do you call it?
6064620	6066620	Armor shell.
6066620	6071620	The bullet, you hear it reflecting inside the armor shell of the machine, and the drone
6071620	6073620	falls to the ground with a crash.
6073620	6075620	It must have been pretty cheap.
6075620	6078620	Yeah.
6078620	6084620	Can I just, like, I just want to restrain this guy immediately.
6084620	6085620	Okay.
6085620	6086620	Yeah.
6086620	6087620	Okay.
6087620	6090260	You start grappling with Baldwin Brown, and you go to the floor.
6090260	6094620	You're rolling around each other, and the goatee-wearing guy is all like, all right,
6094620	6095620	you motherfuckers.
6095620	6099180	Knock this off right now, or I'm gassing this whole place.
6099180	6100180	No fighting.
6100180	6101180	No fighting in here.
6101180	6102180	No fighting.
6102180	6103180	No fighting.
6103740	6106740	Bitch.
6106740	6109180	If I stop fighting, are you going to drone me?
6109180	6110180	No.
6110180	6115180	You killed the drone, bitch.
6115180	6116180	Okay.
6116180	6122180	Can I run back in and use my wireless knife on the kid?
6122180	6125180	Do you just want to, like, stab him with it?
6125180	6126180	Yeah.
6126180	6127180	Yeah.
6127180	6132180	What's your knives, or what's your blades plus agility?
6133180	6137180	So the wireless knife thing is 3P.
6137180	6139180	No, your blade skill, it's a skill.
6139180	6142180	Oh, blade skill, sorry.
6142180	6145180	Four, and my agility is six.
6145180	6147180	Okay.
6147180	6153180	You stab at him with the knife, but with an inhuman cyborg-like reflex, he jumps to the
6153180	6157180	side faster than your eyes can see, and he disarms the blade.
6157180	6159180	Now he's holding the knife.
6159180	6160180	I got the knife, bitch.
6160180	6161180	Stop it.
6161180	6162180	Everybody cool it.
6162180	6163180	Cool it.
6163180	6169180	I'm getting off of Baldwin Brown, and I'm, like, I'm raising my hands.
6169180	6173180	Meanwhile, in the truck, doctor, we should get in there.
6173180	6175180	It sounds like they're having trouble in there.
6175180	6178180	You sure you don't need some healing?
6178180	6179180	You don't need any healing?
6179180	6181180	Yeah, yeah, you could heal me a bit.
6181180	6183180	I could take a bit of quick healing.
6183180	6185180	Can I heal Eve a little?
6185180	6186180	Yeah.
6186180	6188180	Eve is healed for a bit of damage.
6188180	6189180	I healed you.
6189180	6191180	Okay, you know, duck, you're no fighter.
6191180	6192180	We need you alive.
6192180	6193180	Stay in the truck.
6193180	6194180	Guard the BTL chips.
6194180	6195180	I'm going in.
6195180	6196180	Perfect.
6196180	6197180	I run toward the house.
6197180	6198180	All right.
6198180	6199180	You enter the house.
6199180	6204180	You see an old lady sitting on the couch in the front room enjoying a coffee with a dwarf.
6204180	6205180	Oh, hortiguard.
6205180	6206180	Oh, I have some.
6206180	6208180	I taste some of the coffee.
6208180	6209180	All right.
6209180	6211180	I go downstairs in the basement.
6211180	6212180	Okay.
6212180	6213180	You see what's happening.
6213180	6216180	You see Baldwin Brown and Dan kind of, or not Dan, sorry.
6216180	6217180	Sorry, Dan.
6217180	6221180	Jim Nightblade staring at each other like something's going to go down.
6221180	6225180	And you see a young man with goatee holding a knife as if he's going to attack people
6225180	6226180	with it.
6226180	6227180	Hey, guys, this is Baldwin Brown.
6227180	6229180	Let's get this motherfucker and get the fuck out of here.
6229180	6230180	All right.
6230180	6231180	Hold it, hold it, hold it.
6231180	6232180	Okay.
6232180	6233180	Can I use negotiation?
6233180	6234180	Yeah.
6234180	6235180	What are you trying to negotiate?
6235180	6236180	Sit down.
6236180	6237180	Okay.
6237180	6240180	Say words to that effect.
6240180	6241180	All right.
6241180	6244180	Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.
6244180	6245180	Come on.
6246180	6248180	We're all doing the same thing here.
6248180	6249180	Let's just calm down.
6249180	6251180	Put down the knife.
6251180	6253180	And let's talk for a second.
6253180	6254180	All right.
6254180	6256180	I'm going to calm down, but I'm not going to put down the knife.
6256180	6257180	I feel like you just...
6257180	6258180	Fair.
6258180	6259180	Fair.
6259180	6260180	Yeah, okay.
6260180	6261180	Fair.
6261180	6262180	So let's talk.
6262180	6263180	All right.
6263180	6265180	What are you doing here?
6265180	6269180	We would like to have a moment alone with Mr. Brown.
6269180	6270180	This is my house, bitch.
6270180	6271180	You're in my basement.
6271180	6275180	Well, we can take him outside to outside your house.
6275180	6277180	I don't think he wants that.
6277180	6278180	All right.
6278180	6279180	So here's the thing.
6279180	6285180	I have a gun which shoots the equivalent of tiny knives.
6285180	6286180	Uh-huh.
6286180	6289180	And you're holding the only bullet that you have.
6289180	6292180	Oh, you think so, do you?
6292180	6293180	Well, I don't want to...
6293180	6297180	The reason why I got off of your friend is because I don't think that we have to do...
6297180	6301180	We have to kill each other in order to resolve this.
6301180	6306180	Well, I just feel like, you know, when you start fights while we're sleeping, your intentions
6306180	6307180	might be other than that.
6307180	6309180	Hey, Nightblade, why are we talking with these guys?
6309180	6313180	Let's just take Nightblade and get him out of here.
6313180	6317180	I shoot a Force Five stun bolt at the guy with the knife.
6317180	6318180	The guy with the knife.
6318180	6321180	Oh, yeah!
6321180	6325180	All right.
6325180	6327180	You hit him right in the face with a stun bolt.
6327180	6329180	He goes down cold.
6329180	6330180	Yeah.
6330180	6331180	All right.
6331180	6335180	I stand over his stun body and go, who's the bitch now, bitch?
6335180	6341180	And I take his knife and I throw it into a dartboard and it's a bullseye and I go, fuck yeah.
6341180	6344180	And then I sheepishly take it out because it's mine and I put it back in my bag.
6344180	6347180	I feel like my healing helped.
6347180	6348180	Do I have...
6348180	6351180	Over the come, like I say, thanks, Doc.
6351180	6352180	Oh, yeah.
6352180	6354180	Do you need a death touch for anything?
6354180	6355180	Not just yet.
6355180	6356180	Okay.
6356180	6359180	Do I have like zip cuffs or anything like that?
6359180	6360180	No.
6360180	6363180	One of you might have handcuffs or something.
6363180	6364180	I don't.
6364180	6365180	And there's always rope.
6365180	6366180	I've got rope.
6366180	6369180	I tossed Nightblade some rope.
6369180	6370180	All right.
6370180	6373180	I use the rope to fake cuff him.
6373180	6376180	You use the rope.
6377180	6380180	Oh, can I use a taser dart?
6380180	6381180	Sure.
6381180	6382180	Okay.
6382180	6388180	I take a taser dart and I try to put it in McMahons.
6388180	6389180	Wait.
6389180	6390180	We could talk about this.
6390180	6391180	Okay.
6391180	6392180	We could talk about this.
6392180	6393180	All right.
6393180	6394180	Don't I got a taser dart in me?
6394180	6395180	All right.
6395180	6396180	So we're cool?
6396180	6397180	Can we...
6397180	6398180	I mean, no.
6398180	6400180	I'm tied up in my friend's house and you just knocked him out.
6400180	6401180	Well, should we take him to the truck?
6401180	6402180	We're going to solve that problem.
6402180	6403180	You're coming with us.
6403180	6404180	Yeah.
6404180	6405180	Let's get him to the truck and get the hell out of here.
6405180	6406180	We got to get to that...
6406180	6407180	Johnson will be pleased.
6407180	6408180	Johnson's waiting in the truck for us.
6408180	6409180	We'll get our money.
6409180	6410180	We'll be done with this crap.
6410180	6411180	Let's go.
6411180	6412180	Okay.
6412180	6419180	And I use my skill of etiquette and I say to him, like, it's going to be fine.
6419180	6422180	We're going to take care of you.
6422180	6426180	Just be cool and we'll be cool.
6426180	6427180	All right.
6427180	6428180	Okay.
6428180	6430180	I'm resigned to this.
6430180	6431180	All right.
6431180	6432180	He's resigned.
6432180	6433180	All right.
6433180	6434180	All right.
6434180	6435180	Let's get him out to the truck.
6435180	6436180	Get...
6436180	6437180	We'll give him the Baldwin.
6437180	6438180	They can take the truck, the BTLs.
6438180	6440260	We'll get an Uber home.
6440260	6443140	You head back to the truck where you meet with Johnson.
6443140	6444140	He's like, hi.
6444140	6445140	Hey.
6445140	6446140	Hey.
6446140	6447380	Here he is, Johnson.
6447380	6448380	We got your man.
6448380	6449620	We got your BTLs.
6449620	6452580	I guess that's mission accomplished.
6452580	6453580	We did our job.
6453580	6454580	Right?
6454580	6455580	Yeah.
6455580	6456580	That's only...
6456580	6462060	I'm really proud of staying in the truck and helping you guys out as much as I did.
6463060	6464060	You know, Doc, you helped...
6464060	6465060	I just appreciate your energy.
6465060	6467060	It's calming and cool.
6467060	6473060	So, Johnson, pony up the doe, we'll just call it a job accomplished.
6473060	6477540	I mean, you guys were way late on delivering the Baldwin Brown.
6477540	6481060	I feel like that's not, you know, it's not what we agreed on.
6481060	6482060	Okay.
6482060	6483060	I'm going to use...
6483060	6484060	Okay.
6484060	6485060	I'm going to use con.
6485060	6486060	Okay.
6486060	6487060	All right.
6487060	6488060	I walk up to the Johnson.
6488060	6489060	Hey.
6489060	6491460	First of all, you smell great.
6491460	6496060	Second of all, I want to remind you that halfway through our mission, you told us that
6496060	6500260	it was totally appropriate for us to take a little extra time and actually, that's what
6500260	6501260	you preferred.
6501260	6502260	Huh.
6502260	6504260	Don't you remember?
6504260	6507780	If you don't remember, you're an idiot.
6507780	6509420	Do you want to be an idiot?
6509420	6510420	No.
6510420	6511420	No, I don't.
6511420	6512420	All right.
6512420	6514580	I guess here's your money.
6514580	6515580	Thank you.
6515580	6516580	Yeah!
6516580	6517580	How much do we get?
6517580	6518580	How much do we...
6518580	6519580	Guys, count it up.
6519580	6520580	What do we get again?
6520700	6521700	$1,900.
6521700	6522700	It was $5,000 a piece.
6522700	6523700	$5,000 a piece?
6523700	6524700	I was going to really low-ball it.
6524700	6525700	All right.
6525700	6529300	I buy a new hat.
6529300	6534780	So I guess we give him the truck with the BTL chips in it and Baldwin Brown.
6534780	6535780	Yeah.
6535780	6539660	And I go over to the Johnson and say, look, I know you don't want a lot of questions about
6539660	6541700	stuff, but why do you want this guy so bad?
6541700	6545980	Why do you want this guy so bad?
6545980	6548380	Let me tell you in song.
6548380	6549380	No.
6550380	6552820	You know, that's none of your goddamn business.
6552820	6553820	Whoa.
6553820	6554820	Easy.
6554820	6556820	All right.
6556820	6564980	I guess because it's time to start wrapping this up, we all huddle up, which is a thing
6564980	6568660	that we all do at the end of a successful shadow run.
6568660	6575060	And then Mercy leads us in our traditional little, like, chant that we do when we run
6575060	6576580	a shadow properly.
6576580	6577740	Yeah.
6577740	6580220	We fought hard.
6580220	6582420	We fought hard.
6582420	6584180	We fought good.
6584180	6586380	We fought good.
6586380	6588180	We believe in truth.
6588180	6591260	We believe in truth.
6591260	6592300	Get out of my truck.
6592300	6594260	And then we do this weird finger thing.
6594260	6597260	And let's go bowling.
6597260	6598260	Bowling.
6598260	6599260	Bowling.
6599260	6603260	Got you a montage of everyone bowling.
6603260	6610500	So let's all stick around and watch the premiere of season six, episode one of Keep It Up.
6610500	6611500	That's Harmon, John.
6611500	6612500	Thanks for coming.
6612500	6617020	Chris McKenna was our guest, Spencer Crittenden, Aaron McGathey, Jeff Davis.
6617020	6629100	Everybody, I want to see a 37% standing ovation, 37% standing ovation, 100%, 5%, 5%, 0%, 102%,

6631100	6632100	Chris McKenna, Spencer Crittenden, Aaron McGathey.
6632100	6633100	I'm Jeff Davis.
6633100	6636100	How about one more time for Andy over here?
6636100	6638100	Our human being back there.
6638100	6641100	One big loud ooh for Jordan.
6641100	6647100	I'm Jeff Davis, the mayor of Harmon town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
6647100	6656100	Thank you very much for coming.
6657100	6663100	Did you get any of that?
6663100	6668100	It's a good show.
6668100	6671100	Yahoo!
