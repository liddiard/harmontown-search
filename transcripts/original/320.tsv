0	11160	What it is from downtown Los Angeles, or downtown adjacent Los Angeles, from MacArthur Park
11160	16920	where Richard Harris sang a really, really long, terrible song about Carmen Town is now
16920	17920	in session.
17920	24840	Let's bring out, don't think of it as losing a Game Master, think of it as gaining a Rob
24840	25840	Shroff.
25840	26840	Yes!
26840	27840	Rob Shroff, behind the desk.
27840	28840	Where I belong!
28840	29840	Where you belong, where you've been all along.
29840	30840	Let's bring out a mayor for one time.
30840	31840	Where I belong!

42840	43840	Where you belong, where you've been all along.
44840	50840	Where you belong, where you've been all along.
50840	54840	Let's bring out a mayor for one time.
54840	55840	You know him.
55840	59840	His name is Dan Harmon.
59840	64840	Thank you.
64840	65840	Thank you.
65840	66840	It's cold.
66840	67840	It's not cold out here.
67840	68840	I can take my jacket.
68840	69840	The top of this desk, Daniel.
69840	70840	The top of...
70840	71840	Hi, how are you doing today?
71840	72840	The top of this desk is very cold.
72840	73840	Very cold.
73840	74840	I'm just feeling air.
74840	75840	Yeah.
75840	76840	Okay.
76840	77840	Thank you.
77840	78840	The top of this desk is very cold.
78840	79840	Very cold.
79840	80840	I'm just feeling air.
80840	81840	Yeah.
81840	82840	Yeah.
82840	83840	Yeah.
83840	84840	Yeah.
84840	85840	Okay.
85840	86840	Thank you.
86840	100000	Ask not what you can do for your country.
100000	105040	Ask what your country can do for you.
105040	107560	Where is Spencer?
107560	108560	Where is Spencer?
108560	109560	What have we done to defend him?
109560	110560	Where is Spencer?
110560	114560	Do we know?
114560	118080	I didn't kill him.
118080	122160	We just started having a big fight in the green room.
122160	123160	You and me.
123160	125680	I wasn't aware of this.
125680	126680	Why?
126680	127680	What did you do?
127680	128680	I was about...
128680	129680	Die hard.
129680	131840	Like, I don't even want to...
131840	132840	Forget it.
132840	133840	I'm sorry.
133840	134840	I brought it up.
134840	135840	What was the beef?
135840	140560	Rob is misremembering die hard stuff.
140560	145800	I just watched Die Hard again around Christmas time, because as we all know...
145800	148840	It's a Christmas movie.
148840	156160	And we were talking about the number of times, like the runner of John McLean rolling his
156160	159080	eyes at California culture as he arrives.
159080	161120	He's scooping across the threshold.
162120	166360	So in no necessary order, let's enumerate them.
166360	168280	You're mixing and matching.
168280	170400	There are women hitting on him.
170400	174680	That's about his marriage to Holly Gennaro, okay?
174680	175680	The flight attendant.
175680	181760	I almost called her a stewardess, but that would have been fine in die hard times.
181760	185080	She gives him goo-goo eyes, and he's like, what at?
185080	187960	I think that's just establishing.
187960	191840	My perception is he's like, this is gonna be difficult.
191840	196360	It's gonna be difficult to not fuck people that aren't my wife.
196360	197960	He flew out to...
197960	200320	Why are they getting a divorce?
200320	201480	Why are they separated?
201480	208160	Because she chose her career and went to New York, and he was like a silently abusive male
208160	211000	who was not putting his hands on her, but was like, I'm a New York cop.
211000	213680	He explains this all to Argyle.
213680	216360	He has no reason to lie.
216360	218080	He explains it to Argyle.
218080	220280	He goes, I'm a New York cop.
220280	222320	I got cases to solve.
222320	225160	I'm not gonna up and leave for Los Angeles.
225160	226160	Who's Argyle?
226160	227160	Oh, the limo.
227160	228160	The fucking limo.
228160	229160	See, all right.
229160	230160	I don't know.
230160	234400	There was a guy in the plane that said, take your socks off, and I thought, oh, his name
234400	235400	is Argyle.
235400	237120	That makes sense.
237120	238560	But I was wrong.
238560	240600	Oh, is that on purpose?
240600	242160	That it's kind of a David Lynch thing, right?
242160	243160	There's like a...
243160	244160	Yeah.
244160	245160	One guy says, take your socks off.
245160	247680	Take your toes, and then my name's Argyle.
247680	249080	My name is Commander Sockson.
249080	251760	That would be like a David Lynch thing.
251760	253440	But you forget what I was...
253440	260400	You never got a chance to let me finish my thought that the whole reason...
260400	261800	There is a...
261800	265000	The first person to play John McClain was Frank Sinatra.
265000	266000	Oh, right.
266000	267000	Yeah.
267000	268000	No.
268000	269000	That's very interesting to me.
269000	271040	I'm not being sarcastic.
271040	272200	Yes.
272200	273200	Because they made...
273720	277680	Okay, so Die Hard is based off of a book.
277680	279840	I don't know the name of the book.
279840	280840	Somebody look it up.
280840	281840	All right?
281840	282840	I'm sure it's out there somewhere.
282840	283840	Anyway, it's a...
283840	284840	Snakes on a Plane.
284840	285840	Snakes on a Plane.
285840	286840	The original...
286840	287840	The original...
287840	289840	1934 Joseph Conrad novel.
289840	290840	Okay.
290840	294720	So, Die Hard, the book...
294720	300240	It's not called Die Hard the book, but let's just say, Die Hard the book is a sequel to
300240	308040	another story, another book featuring John McClain that was already made into a movie
308040	309040	starring Frank Sinatra.
309040	311160	So, the character's name was John McClain?
311160	312160	I think so.
312160	313160	But it's based off of the...
313160	314160	It's the same series.
314160	315400	I think they switched it up a little bit.
315400	316400	I don't know.
316400	317400	I haven't seen this movie.
317400	320080	I would like to hang out with you.
320080	322680	All right.
322680	326840	So, Frank Sinatra played a character in a film called...
326840	329920	And the character's name was John McClain.
330720	332600	I think they might've changed the name or whatever.
332600	333600	I don't know.
333600	340040	I don't have it in front of me, but the point is that when they made Die Hard, they had
340040	345200	to go to Frank Sinatra, who I think was in his 70s at the time, and say, hey, do you
345200	346760	want to play John McClain?
346760	350600	Contractually, they had to go to him and he went, what?
350600	351760	No.
351760	357000	And they went, oh, okay, because we already casted somebody else.
358000	359440	Okay.
359440	361040	So some problems solved themselves.
361040	362400	Well, he was 70.
362400	367840	He's not going to do Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker, and shooting the glass and the hose walking.
367840	368840	You know?
368840	369840	He's not going to do that.
369840	370840	He's 70.
370840	372440	I mean, he's Frank Sinatra, but he's 70, man.
372440	377720	They get Sinatra Ranch, a helicopter landed, and two guys come out in suits, take their
377720	380040	hats off, like, Mrs. Sinatra!
380040	381040	It's Frank Holmes!
381040	382040	She's like...
382040	386760	She opens the door wider, and he comes with the IV bag on the rack, and he's like, what
386760	389400	do you want, baby?
389400	392440	And they go, Mr. Sinatra!
392440	401120	Do you want to play a 1982 action hero, 1986, 1987, when was that hard?
401120	408200	Do you want to play, do you want to pick up where the star, you're either going to use
408200	413720	you or the star of the Seagram's wine cooler commercials?
413720	416200	And he said, ring-a-ding-ding, Jack.
416200	420920	Okay, good, we're glad you said that, because Jesus Christ, that was a close one, because
420920	423720	we're halfway through shooting.
423720	424720	Ring-a-ding-ding, Jack.
424720	433080	Instead of Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker, this is kind of a sequel to last week's show, because
433080	435520	you were saying Yippee-ki-yay references.
435520	436520	I was.
436520	437520	All right.
437520	438520	Is that a question?
438520	439520	Yeah.
439520	440520	Listen to the recording.
440520	441520	Was I here?
441520	443760	All right, well, I apologize for the show tonight.
443760	444760	It's rainy.
444760	449280	It has to be here, except for you guys, I'm sure.
449280	450560	And we'll make it worth your while.
450560	451560	And Spencer.
451560	454000	The rest of the country is freezing, freezing, freezing.
454000	455000	It's been raining here nonstop.
455000	456000	Oh, my God.
456000	457000	It's so cold.
457000	464320	I like that Church has two seats taped off next door, like she doesn't like human contact
464320	465320	messages.
465320	470160	It's just seats reserved for the polls.
470160	472160	Or around.
472160	477040	The mania and depression are reserved for, like, don't come near me.
477040	478040	I'm a photographer.
478040	479040	I'm a photographer.
479040	480040	Figure it out.
480040	486360	I almost hit, I almost hit somebody tonight with my car.
486360	488080	With your car.
488080	492960	Thank you for your applause.
492960	495240	Weird Hallmark Theater version of the devil.
495240	498000	Oh, I love it.
498000	500160	Where are they?
500160	501160	Adams family?
501160	503400	They're like, this soup is cold.
503400	504520	I love it.
504520	505520	What show?
505520	506520	The Adams family.
506520	507520	Sorry.
507520	508520	What show?
508520	509520	Never mind.
509520	510520	He meant the monsters.
510520	511520	No, no.
511520	512520	It's the Adams family.
512520	515800	They're like, how do you like my dress?
515800	516800	It's dark.
516800	517800	It's tattered.
517800	519160	It looks like a funeral gown.
519160	521160	I love it.
521160	523880	Gomez, you were terrible last night.
523880	526680	Please do it again.
526680	530200	Do you think that extends to, like, do they end up just randomly inverting things?
530200	534320	Like if the Adams family lasted 30 seasons, would they just be like, I'm standing in
534320	536760	this chair because I love hate it.
536760	543480	And they're just, like, floating around the room, like, cubes are circles because they're
543480	544480	not.
544480	549400	I sneezed backwards and drank all these boogers.
549400	550400	You seriously, think about it.
550400	555540	You couldn't, you couldn't make like, you couldn't make the Adams family movie these
555540	559640	days because there's too much, like we feel like we're pressing up against the edges of
559640	560640	evil, right?
560640	565920	Because that was like a very Clinton era, like, kind of thing, like, you could be punk
565920	566920	rock.
566920	571200	Like, let's remake the Adams family because who doesn't want to be, it was like, oh, Lydia
571200	574960	in Beetlejuice is Wednesday Adams, so let's do the Adams family.
574960	576280	Okay, that's fun.
576280	579360	Like who doesn't feel like an Adams when they're in high school?
579360	583960	But the answer is everyone who's, like, feels like their life is in danger now.
583960	588080	It's like, like, if you were, if you really go down the road of what the Adams family,
588080	591680	like the bits they'd be doing, it would be like, I can't even, I can't even riff examples.
591680	592680	The misfits.
592680	594840	I'll be booed off the stage because of the examples.
594840	600440	The misfits, the, the ne'er-do-wells, the people in the back of the bus, the people,
600440	605320	the square pegs, the round holes of life, these people.
605320	606320	That's who you're, you're-
606320	609560	Who are you voting for when you turn 18 Wednesday?
609560	612560	Who is the most divisive candidate?
612560	617000	Good girl.
617000	619920	Which school would you like to go to, Columbine?
619920	625560	Oh, you're such a, oh, you're such an Adams.
625560	631680	You're so on theme with your Adams-ness, you want to go to the bloodiest place for school.
631680	637560	Yeah, see, I told you, and if I tell you, you're not allowed to be offended.
637560	639360	It's called getting out in front of it.
639360	644680	Look it up on your precious internet that kicked me off of it.
645680	650840	I've got nothing to do now but collect cookies on my iPad and wait for Armageddon.
650840	654120	I was in the car with Dan on the way here and he was collecting all those cookies.
654120	655120	Did he hit anybody?
655120	661160	Oh yeah, so I almost hit somebody.
661160	666880	It wasn't because I was, it's just the whole audience is now the guys in top hats, delicious.
666880	669040	I just got controlled by Schwab.
670040	672240	Somebody's got to take control.
672240	675160	Somebody's got to get this train into the station.
675160	678160	Somebody's got to keep the fucking bells ringing on time.
678160	681640	I wasn't collecting cookies and I wasn't doing anything particularly...
681640	682640	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
682640	683640	Rob has a text.
683640	684640	Rob has a text.
689320	695040	This comes from Chris Boroff in the sound booth.
695040	696760	Your peas are popping.
696760	700280	My peas are popping.
700280	708040	No, apparently the Frank Sinatra movie Nothing Lasts Forever and that was written by Roderick
708040	709040	Thorpe.
715040	717040	I accept your apology.
719040	721320	Alright, anyways, I almost hit a young lady.
722120	727880	I want to minimize it by saying she was dressed like a ninja but she was, you know, it was
727880	730120	yoga pants and a sweater.
730120	731920	It wasn't the brightest sweater in the world.
731920	732920	Look, it's my fault.
732920	734600	I'm the one in the vehicle.
734600	740600	But it's a weird thing because I wasn't really doing anything irresponsible.
740600	746280	I just wasn't driving as if you might hit someone any moment.
746280	748360	I just got too comfortable.
748360	749960	So used to like, get off the freeway.
750080	751720	Were you doing the Tesla hands-free?
751720	753720	No, no, no, no, no.
753720	761400	I just get off the freeway and like psychologically in like autopilot, not actual Tesla autopilot,
761400	763760	like just sort of like, this is what I do every day.
763760	766920	This is, there's no, no, there's never pedestrians around here.
766920	775680	I just had that experience of like, she was jogging and she, I just sort of like, I didn't,
775680	779520	I'm so used to taking this corner and I just kind of like, yeah, I slowed down but there's
779520	780640	no stop sign there.
780640	784840	So I'm going to, I slowed down a little bit and then I'm going to take this corner.
784840	790440	And as I'm taking this corner, there's this person and they're jogging and I slam her
790440	797080	in the brakes and she looks over her shoulder hearing the silent, a plaintiff whale of a
797080	800560	Tesla coming to a halt.
800560	804880	And she kind of like, lip synced some stuff and I can't hear her because of my amazing
804880	807920	car that seals off all sound and air.
807920	814560	And she kind of like jogs away a mute, a mute poor person calling her pointless cries
814560	820160	into the filthy air that I don't have to breathe in my Tesla.
820160	823480	This story is getting charming.
823480	828680	But I just, I was, I was like very, yeah, I don't know, it's like a sliding doors moment,
828680	834480	you know, because I could have just tapped, you know, I might've just tapped her on her,
834960	840320	on her hip and surely she would have like, boom, you know, like all over, it's a zero
840320	845520	sum game when it comes to like your car colliding with a pedestrian, you either do it or you
845520	846800	don't.
846800	850080	Even if she hadn't been seriously injured, it was like, you just like kind of like if
850080	856560	a car just slides into you at two miles an hour, you like, she would rag dialed off of
856560	857560	my hood.
857560	862080	Just imagine, I wouldn't be here tonight, imagine your whole life could, it would be
862080	863080	changed.
863080	865160	I don't know what my point is.
865160	866160	Nothing matters.
866160	871080	Vote for Ron Perlman.
871080	873800	Zero sums game.
873800	875800	Oh God.
875800	876800	Okay.
876800	877800	All right.
877800	878800	Come on.
878800	879800	Let's bring out our guest.
879800	880800	What is that?
880800	883760	Come on, come on, explain yourself.
883760	888680	He's here promoting his upcoming Comedy Central special, which was last month, but he had
888680	889680	to reschedule.
889680	890680	So please welcome Ron Funches.
890680	891680	Yay!
891680	892680	How's it going, man?
892680	893680	Good.
893680	894680	How are you?
894680	895680	I'm good.
895680	916880	I'm a little, I've been traveling and I'm a little sleepy, but I'm kind of in that Ron
916880	919120	Funches kind of mellow zone.
920120	928040	Are you actually this mellow, or is this like a put on, like, do you, is Ron Funches
928040	931840	actually this much Funches?
931840	936080	I mean, I didn't enjoy that pun.
936080	938400	I don't go with everything.
938400	941040	I aspire to be in that mellow zone that you're in.
941040	943080	It's not bad.
943080	946320	How would we ever know if you were silently raging though?
946320	952520	I guess you would, because I'd be silent unless you were in tune with me.
952520	956840	Like a lot of people who are less, I think, pleasant than you, a lot of people less pleasant
956840	967480	than you, if we were to act like you usually do, like, it would, for us, of the less pleasant
967480	971360	variety, it might be a warning sign that we were upset about something.
971360	972360	Does that make sense?
972360	974320	Oh, if you were to act like me?
974360	981680	Yeah, if we were like so osmotic, osmotic, osmotically kind of like permeable, like you're
981680	983120	always like, hey, Ron, how you doing?
983120	984160	I'm doing good.
984160	984880	I'm fine.
984880	990760	And it's like, if someone asked me how I'm doing and I said that, it might mean that
990760	992080	I was very upset.
994240	996360	Might mean you hit that lady with your car.
1000360	1002520	I got a body to bury.
1002520	1003520	I'm okay.
1004560	1006960	Ron, did we talk about this before on the show?
1006960	1010800	I was behind you at an airport and I thought it was you, but you were in front of me, so
1010800	1014720	I didn't see your face, but I thought, I think that's Ron.
1014720	1020400	And you got stopped by airport security and you got the full Monty.
1020400	1023160	You got pat down the whole thing.
1023160	1025320	And you were the only non-white person at that airport.
1025320	1028960	I don't even remember where it was, maybe Washington or something.
1028960	1033520	And you got the whole thing and you were just chill and fucking groovy, like I would have
1033520	1037280	been fucking pissed off, but you were, you just like let it happen.
1037280	1043160	Well, I mean, I'm usually pretty chill about it because I do have drugs with me, so.
1043160	1044360	So you got to play it cool.
1044360	1045360	Yeah.
1045360	1050560	That's always the thing that makes me laugh, I'm always like, oh, you guys are so thorough.
1059520	1061080	Was there a transition for you?
1061080	1067240	Were you, as a six year old child on the playground, were you easy going and pleasant
1067240	1068760	and giggly and cuddly?
1068760	1074160	Or did you have a come to Jesus, like John the Baptist, holy shit.
1074160	1078960	Like if we flash back to you, there's an origin story where you're like putting thumb tacks
1078960	1080960	under a frog.
1080960	1083960	What?
1083960	1087080	It's something John the Baptist did.
1087080	1096600	I guess no one's supposed to unpack my language that much, I just get the general gist of
1096600	1097600	the question.
1097600	1098600	Yeah.
1098600	1100160	People usually just go with whatever you say.
1100160	1101160	Yeah.
1101160	1102160	Yeah.
1102160	1104160	What are you guys, Pete Holmes or something?
1104160	1108200	Listening to what I ask and revealing that it makes no sense.
1108200	1109200	Yeah.
1109200	1115960	I mean, my question is like, yeah, like, were you, were you always, yeah, learned habit
1115960	1117840	or is this just who I am?
1117840	1120000	Or have you gone through epiphanies, thresholds?
1120000	1121920	I think, yeah, everybody does.
1121920	1127720	You know, everybody goes through growth, personal changes, people, you know, and I've gone through
1127720	1128720	enough.
1128720	1130760	I think I have enough personal traumas.
1130760	1133400	Like my life's never been like easy.
1133400	1139960	So like I have single parent, my mom's a single parent and we moved into from Chicago or from
1139960	1142520	LA to Chicago and lived in a rough area.
1142520	1146880	And then my mom was in like an abusive relationship and with you.
1146880	1147880	Yeah.
1147880	1148880	Yeah.
1148880	1149880	I wasn't good.
1149880	1150880	Not a funny joke.
1150880	1151880	Yeah.
1151880	1152880	It's not good.
1152880	1153880	I mean, just let things.
1153880	1154880	Sometimes they're hilarious.
1154880	1155880	Yeah.
1155880	1158840	Well, you know, sometimes you got to pick your moment.
1158840	1159840	Yeah.
1159840	1169920	I mean, yeah, you ask me a question and it undercut my life.
1169920	1173720	Tell me the deep dark secrets about who makes you who you are.
1173720	1176360	And then also I'm gonna make a bud joke.
1176360	1177360	Fight, fight, fight, fight.
1177360	1182360	You mean you ate a fart in front of you to eat a fart sandwich?
1182360	1183360	Yeah.
1183360	1184360	Yeah.
1184360	1185360	Yeah.
1185360	1186360	So I got what I deserve.
1186360	1187360	Let it go and keep answering.
1187360	1188360	Yeah.
1188360	1204200	So I just stuff like that.
1204200	1209600	And then my life and then my son and you know, and my son has had some very young when he
1209600	1215960	was 20 and then he found out he had autism my time was 22 and and that kind of was just
1215960	1219960	like, I think I just had enough things kind of tweak my brain where I was like, Oh, I
1219960	1223600	know what I want to do and I'm gonna just try to do this.
1223600	1226600	And once I started getting a little, it wasn't always good.
1226600	1229800	I was, you know, in my early twenties, I wasn't like a great person.
1229800	1230800	I didn't know what I was doing.
1230800	1235560	I was a float, just kind of being like a shitty nerd, you know, when, you know, when you're
1235560	1238680	like, Oh, I get picked on and things have been bad for me.
1238680	1243440	So my life owes me shit, you know, and then I just had a point where I realized like nothing
1243440	1245040	was coming to me.
1245040	1249320	I had to go and get whatever I was going to get.
1249320	1258680	And were there any moments like that you remember where you that were like, like external stimulations,
1258680	1264600	whether they were like events or conversations where you were like, Oh, and from that.
1264600	1268840	And then that's when I realized, Oh shit, I've been doing this this way and I should
1268840	1270320	do it this way now instead.
1270320	1275880	Like, like, were there any like defining moments as well as what I, I don't know, I
1275880	1281360	mean, is what I'll undercut and then I'll, I mean, the most moment that I think that
1281360	1289360	put me into like high gear and my most motivating moment was a little bit after I found out
1289360	1291480	my son was diagnosed with autism.
1291480	1297320	And then I went into this park that I had always taken my son to when he was young or
1297320	1299280	younger because he was two at the time he's diagnosed.
1299280	1303160	So I'm just like one or this is also the same park that I used to smoke weed in when
1303160	1304600	I was in high school.
1304600	1308920	And me and my girlfriend would just go hang out and make out there who eventually was
1308920	1313920	my ex wife and, and we're there and we're find out that, you know, just kind of shell
1313920	1316000	shock and just kind of talking about it.
1316000	1322080	And then we see like a group of disabled adults and their caretakers kind of pull up to the
1322080	1323080	park as well.
1323080	1329240	And the way that the caretakers spoke to them and treated them was very dismissive and very
1329240	1334760	cruel and treated them more like if they were prisoners and then people to be looked
1334760	1335760	after.
1335760	1341480	And at that point I was like, Oh, I have to figure out like a career, I have to figure
1341480	1342920	out something.
1342920	1345960	This is bigger than me and whatever I'm doing.
1345960	1349600	Like, I guess this is before that you started doing comedy.
1349600	1350600	Yeah.
1350600	1354240	So then you chose comedy out of that epiphany.
1354240	1355240	Yeah.
1355240	1356800	So were you, I just want to unpack that moment.
1356800	1363320	I'm here for you guys to be on each side like this.
1363320	1369840	Just focusing in on that moment, just to understand it, you, you, this caretakers being flipping
1369840	1374920	abusive, whatever word you want to use, as if they were like prisoners, you know, yelling
1374920	1375920	at them.
1375920	1381400	Were you, was your epiphany because you felt like, Oh, that's a shitty person.
1381400	1385480	And then did you see a little bit of your, you're like, Oh, I've been a shitty person
1385480	1386480	to other people.
1386480	1387880	Or were you thinking like, I never want to be that person.
1387880	1389920	I was more like, I don't want to be like that.
1389920	1392320	And it was more like, I don't want that for my son.
1392320	1396000	And I guess I'm, I guess I'm not really fun when you're thinking it's more, this is more
1396000	1398240	motivating than me as a person.
1398240	1404560	I think anything that's me as a person has been just, um, well, no, wait, no, that's
1404560	1405560	good.
1405560	1407400	No, that's good that you're, cause I'm a narcissist.
1407400	1409480	So I'm thinking about filing things.
1409480	1410960	Oh, you were a narcissist.
1410960	1412560	Yeah, really shocked.
1412560	1415320	You told the story about you almost killed a lady and you were like, I could have been
1415320	1416320	laid.
1416320	1417320	Yeah.
1417320	1425480	She shouldn't have dressed like a ninja.
1425480	1430600	She had a bright white sweater on and so like, like immediately caught myself revising.
1430600	1432640	I was like, I'm going to describe this story.
1432640	1433840	This is something interesting to talk about.
1433840	1439120	She was dressed so darkly and I'm like, she had a fucking white sweater on, stop it.
1439120	1445240	Um, but, um, the, but no, the, the idea that, so your answer to the question is more interesting
1445240	1451000	because you're feeling, you felt empathy for the, uh, disenfranchised in that moment.
1451000	1459040	And so what you were feeling was those people need, uh, someone to be better for them.
1459040	1462780	And the only people that are in a position to be better for them are people that have
1462780	1464380	that option.
1464380	1468760	And that, that, that invited you upward to that plane is what I'm kind of interpreting.
1468760	1472920	Well, mostly it was just like, I gotta make a lot of money so my son's never in this fucking
1472920	1473920	position.
1473920	1474920	Wow.
1475920	1482360	But you were what, 22 you said at the time.
1482360	1485080	And so you said, I got to make this money.
1485080	1489200	And did you, when was the decision to go to comedy?
1489200	1491640	Like were you, were you already kind of leaning in that direction?
1491640	1492640	Yeah.
1492640	1493640	I always wanted to do it.
1493640	1496160	You know, it was just the thing that I was interested in, but I didn't think it was a
1496160	1497160	real job.
1497160	1501400	Um, and so I just was like, I knew I needed a career and not just a job.
1501400	1505960	I was working at like this bank call center and I hated it and I knew that I couldn't
1505960	1506960	stay there.
1506960	1508840	What, what, what part of town were you in?
1508840	1509840	In Salem, Oregon.
1509840	1510840	Yeah.
1510840	1516360	And so do you start like, like doing open mics and like, yeah, I started doing mics
1516360	1521200	in Portland and, and, um, and then there's this Chinese food restaurant in Salem that
1521200	1522200	has this show.
1522200	1523200	It's a place called Lucky Fortune.
1523200	1524200	I've been there.
1524200	1525200	It's good.
1525200	1526200	I've been there.
1526200	1527200	Yeah.
1527200	1530440	So, you know, they would do shows and you get Chinese food and the guy would sell like
1530440	1536040	movies after the shows and it was just a good place for you to cut your crack, cut
1536040	1537040	your teeth.
1537040	1538040	You know?
1538040	1539520	Oh, it's like they had an open mic there.
1539520	1540520	No, just a show.
1540520	1543040	It was a show, but it wasn't good.
1543040	1549960	And so might as well, he'd always just lie and be like, I remember for years he, um,
1549960	1556960	he, he, he was telling me that this, this, um, I already forgot the name of the story's
1556960	1557960	gonna be horrible.
1557960	1558960	So nevermind.
1558960	1561320	But what do you do?
1561320	1562320	I'm curious.
1562320	1566480	So you, you, you, if you have that epiphany, it's a little, it's like, it's your Buddha
1566480	1567480	moment.
1567480	1568480	You're like, okay.
1568480	1573720	I like, like my kid, I, if he slips through my fingers, he's going to end up a ward of
1573720	1576400	people like this guy that you saw in the park.
1576400	1579920	And so then you go, I got to do what I love.
1579920	1582920	Not just I gotta go get a job managing a factory floor.
1582920	1585840	Like it's about money, but it's also about following your bliss.
1585840	1592760	So what does somebody young do when they decide they want to take comedy seriously?
1592760	1595040	Like what are your first steps?
1595040	1600160	You're like sitting there with a Manila, a legal pad on a pencil or like, like, like
1600160	1601480	describe those days.
1601480	1602480	Yeah.
1602480	1607520	I would, I mean, back then I was like, write out full scripts of my jokes and stuff.
1607520	1612640	And I'd like go over them and, and try to memorize every word and
1612640	1617360	Did you include, you included people laughing in your head, like, like, and then I'll pause
1617360	1619520	and then there'll be all this laughter.
1619520	1623040	His whole four applause.
1623040	1625520	And then I would even like fact check my jokes.
1625520	1628920	I would think like, Oh, someone, someone hears this joke.
1628920	1631720	They might call me out on the, on the background.
1631720	1635000	So I better know about this.
1635000	1642640	That's very, for the, for whatever that era was, it's probably a little, uh, overly responsible
1642640	1643640	of you.
1643640	1644640	Yeah.
1644640	1645960	No, I over, over prepare.
1645960	1646960	You were ready for today.
1646960	1647960	Oh God.
1647960	1656920	And you're like vetting your standup against, uh, the, the years of 25 million angry people.
1656920	1662520	What was the threshold run from, uh, like being an open mic or, and then like, did you,
1662520	1664280	did you move to LA right away or?
1664280	1667400	No, that would have been a bad decision.
1667400	1673400	But the threshold from being like, I'm going to try this out to going, Oh, this is working.
1673400	1679000	And like, I'm, I'm now like, like you're, you're headlining, you're, you're being like
1679000	1680000	top man.
1680000	1685640	I mean, it took a little while, you know, I was doing shows and just going around the
1685640	1691240	country and I had my friend, uh, Will, who, who would drive us around his mom's minivan
1691240	1697360	and we would go and do shows and book shows up and down Salem and in other parts of Oregon
1697360	1698360	in the Northwest.
1698360	1702000	We would just go to different bars and just try to convince them to book a show and that
1702000	1705680	we could bring an audience in and we booked one show and then they realized that we could
1705680	1706680	not.
1706680	1711680	And so, so we would just continue and move on that way.
1711680	1715120	And I did that for a couple of years and then I just started getting better and getting
1715120	1719320	more name for myself and I would just, um, you're making deals.
1719320	1723960	You were like Jim Hensoning it, like the way he like sold the Muppet show and syndication.
1723960	1728760	You were at a, you didn't have an agent that was like, this here's Ron Funches and I'm
1728760	1730200	going to book you on this circuit.
1730200	1733360	You're going to open for so-and-so if you pick them up from the airport, this business
1733360	1739160	you, I don't start with, Hey, no, I had to book my own shows and a lot of my own, you're
1739160	1742440	going to bars and convincing them to have a venue in the first place so that you could
1742440	1743440	perform there.
1743440	1745400	And then you were making a deal with them and like take part of the door.
1745400	1746400	Yeah.
1746400	1747400	Yeah.
1747400	1750640	And then we kind of like was my business partner and we just do that together.
1750640	1755840	He would, we go scout locations and just try to make deals.
1755840	1762200	And I ran, I ran my own weekly show at a coffee house and those are the, like the most pressure
1762200	1766760	filled days because a lot of times that would be like, I was like, Oh, I need to pass this
1766760	1772200	hat around for money so that I can come home and bring my son and my ex home food and stuff.
1772200	1775320	You know, I didn't, I wasn't making like any money at that time.
1776240	1777240	What do you even say?
1777240	1786040	I mean, there is like, there are people in the world, probably half of my listeners,
1786040	1790880	like the, the idea of inoffensive comedy, like it sounds like a pejorative in terms
1790880	1795920	of comedy, oxymoronic, contradictory, the idea that you could be funny without hurting
1795920	1801160	people without taking anybody down without like attacking, without having without, without
1801160	1802480	wounding and things.
1802480	1808800	But you're pretty much like your standup is, is giggle fit as a comedy central.
1808800	1814440	You also got your, well, we'll talk about getting better in a second, but, but, but
1814440	1818520	like you, would you, you, you would characterize your goal when you get on stage or maybe not
1818520	1823120	your goal, but like your MO is like, you don't, you're, you're not, you're not leaving a body
1823120	1824120	count, right?
1824120	1826440	You're not, you're not like, you're not hurting people.
1826440	1832240	I never understood that as a theme of what comedy needs to be that there are, I mean,
1832240	1836800	sure sometimes you attack things, but I think your job as a comedian, I'm a student of comedy.
1836800	1837800	I love comedy.
1837800	1841600	I've loved comedy since I was a young child and everything.
1841600	1846760	Every good comedian I saw, it was like, you, you, you, you speak truth to power.
1846760	1851760	You take down people bigger than you, you, you point out the inconsistencies in the status
1851760	1852760	quo.
1852760	1856080	You don't just attack people to attack people.
1856080	1860520	You don't just go like, okay, like Mexicans or this, like that, like your, that's building
1860520	1862040	the status quo.
1862040	1869040	That's reinforcing like what people are saying when, when, when your job usually is as a jester,
1869040	1872400	you don't make fun of the townspeople, you make fun of the king, you know?
1872400	1878160	So like, I, I, I take that job, I think that it's very serious.
1878160	1881840	So do you do some, do you do some punching up in your opinion?
1881840	1886840	I mean, is it like, like it's, it is punching, but it's punching up or, I mean, a little
1886840	1892920	bit for most part, I'm also very, I mean, I guess I would say I'm narcissistic in my
1892920	1898640	own ways in the regard, like I prefer just talking about me in my life and what's going
1898640	1899720	on.
1899720	1901040	That's what's exciting to me.
1901040	1904520	I've never been excited about those types of things.
1904520	1909160	I mean, I think my mom, my mom just, my mom just said, she's like, we're just, she's like,
1909160	1914600	we're not very passionate people.
1914600	1916640	She's just explaining that to company when they come over.
1916640	1917640	Yeah.
1917640	1919560	You have to understand the funches are not passionate people.
1919560	1922280	Like I don't care about much.
1922280	1927080	I care about my son, I care about my family, I care about few things, but like I, it would
1927080	1935840	be very, um, uh, just not truthful of me to go up there and be, this is what I'm ranting
1935840	1936840	about.
1936840	1937840	This is what I'm upset about.
1937840	1942800	I got, I got 10 minutes about, about abortion legislation because I'm like so focused on
1942800	1944840	that because I have so many rye.
1944840	1949440	Like last year there was like six comedy specials I watched, I watch a lot of comedy specials
1949440	1950440	and stuff.
1950440	1953720	Still there were like six last year, all with like, he's Caitlyn Jenner jokes.
1953720	1958640	I know it's even hacked to even talk about now, but I was just like, why did you guys
1958640	1960240	care so much?
1960240	1966760	Who, why did you give a fuck like who you, that's how you spend your day was sitting
1966760	1970880	around thinking about Caitlyn Jenner and what Caitlyn Jenner wants to do.
1970880	1975400	I met Caitlyn Jenner, not a person worth talking about.
1975400	1978600	Whoa, shots fired.
1978600	1983440	I think the cycle that happens, my theory about it is from talking to my therapist about
1983440	1987960	just like generally like about how positive and negative shit sticks and whatever and
1987960	1990880	how negative shit sticks so much easier.
1990880	2000680	And so it's like jokes that we remember, they're, they're often attached to satire
2000680	2006080	and like, like, like somebody gets taken down a peg or something happens, something shifts.
2006080	2012120	Oh, that person made that joke and then that was like a kaboom, and it sticks in your memory
2012120	2016640	for the same reason that if somebody says like, oh, you're wearing that shirt again sticks
2016640	2020440	longer than someone saying, I like your shirt, which doesn't stick at all.
2020960	2027040	And so I think when people are in the nation stages of their comedic ambitions, they're
2027040	2029160	kind of like, how do I be funny?
2029160	2034680	And they, and they, and they sit by that stream of society and they go, well, most important
2034680	2039680	thing is I'll sit here, I'll watch some stuff and I'll try to think about like what, what
2039680	2041360	I might say that would be funny about it.
2041360	2045200	And they're going to tend to slide into, well, what would I say that would be taking this
2045200	2051800	thing apart, you know, kind of Joel McCaling, the Kardashians or, you know, David Spading,
2051800	2057120	the, the, the whatever's like, and it, because that's the stuff that kind of spikes on the,
2057120	2061800	on the EKG, I guess it's, it, it sticks in your memory.
2061800	2062800	Yeah.
2062800	2066800	But then you think about it, yeah, like Steve Martin, my memory of him is like, he'd come
2066800	2070880	out and he would just do this like weird one person show.
2070880	2072640	It was just, it was just humor.
2072640	2074480	It was absurd.
2074920	2079040	Well, I just think it's easier, you know, it's, it's easier to tear apart than to build,
2079040	2080040	you know?
2080040	2086520	So like when you're trying to actually build jokes that don't do that, it just takes longer.
2086520	2087520	It's harder.
2087520	2089960	Sometimes people don't, don't get them right away.
2089960	2090960	So it's just harder.
2090960	2096280	The beauty of Steve Martin's stuff was that he was clearly intellectual, but he was silly.
2096280	2100480	And so we, we got to watch an intellect be stupid, like for us.
2100480	2107000	It was so crazy to me to watch those old ones and be like, this is a stadium full of
2107000	2111480	people watching the guy put a arrow on him.
2111480	2112480	Yeah.
2112480	2115560	And he would go, I'm a wild, crazy guy.
2115560	2119040	And the whole place with like Madison Square Garden would share.
2119040	2120040	It's crazy.
2120040	2122240	You know, it's interesting though, I was talking about this family tree of comedy or whatever
2122240	2123240	you call it.
2123240	2125920	Like the, uh, he was never personal.
2125920	2126920	He wouldn't go.
2126920	2127920	Yeah.
2127920	2129520	So here's what's going on with me.
2129520	2130680	Where was he political?
2130680	2134760	So George Carlin, very political, not a lot of personal to George Carlin, right?
2134760	2138200	Like George Carlin wouldn't like pause, take a glass of water, break down and go.
2138200	2144040	So anyways, I'm married and et cetera, Bill Cosby drew all these stories from, from marriage
2144040	2147240	and children, but like how transparent was it?
2147240	2148240	You're very personal.
2148240	2150480	You talk about raising an autistic kid.
2150480	2153080	You talk about like, like your life.
2153080	2155880	Like I don't, I don't, I have no question about this.
2155880	2158480	I just wanted to like go into that area.
2158480	2163520	Like, like when you're, if you're sitting and you're going, uh, I think I'll share this
2163520	2168960	thing about raising, uh, being a single dad, raising autistic kid, like, uh, are there
2168960	2169960	ground rules?
2169960	2175280	Do you think to yourself, like, is my kid going to be 30 and, and, and listen to this
2175280	2178520	on a hologram disc one day and get the wrong idea?
2178520	2181000	What are the thoughts that go through your head in terms of filtration?
2181000	2184000	Um, I probably should think more about it.
2184000	2186400	And yeah, you should.
2186400	2187400	Yeah.
2187480	2193240	But no, I just kind of, I just like to talk about what I love and I just try to talk about
2193240	2194240	it with love.
2194240	2198640	You know, I think that's been my main goal is make sure people, you know, talking about
2198640	2202640	my son in particular, I just want to make sure people knew that I wasn't making fun
2202640	2208400	of him and I wasn't trying to be like, Oh, my son has this disability and this is what's
2208400	2209400	funny about it.
2209400	2211800	It's just more like, this is just a part of my life.
2211800	2212800	This is my son.
2212800	2217360	He does some funny things are, and these are some just other misunderstandings that I've
2217360	2218360	happened.
2218360	2220400	This is just a part of my life.
2220400	2221600	So I just always try to do that.
2221600	2222600	Same thing with my mom.
2222600	2225240	Same thing with anyone that I talk about.
2225240	2231400	I just try to make sure I don't, you know, you know, Louis C.K. is where he's just making
2231400	2234560	everything like, ah, my fucking kids.
2234560	2235560	Yeah.
2235560	2240920	I, I, I, yeah.
2240920	2243080	I mean, I have stuff to say about that.
2243120	2250000	I like Louis style is so like he would pace the stage like a caged animal and he would
2250000	2256880	talk like Charlie Brown and it had this like viscera to it and he like, but it was like,
2256880	2262040	is it, is it bad to do that if it, if, if it's not actually transparent, if it's like
2262040	2265640	a periscope, that's bouncing off of two mirrors, is it like, yeah.
2265640	2269840	And does any of that matter if it's like, well, they're, they laughed.
2269840	2274240	So but I'm like, yeah, but what if they're laughing at like, because they think that
2274240	2275240	you're real.
2275240	2280280	What if they think that Tim Allen really does go home and go, Oh yeah.
2280280	2281480	And like, like, I don't know.
2281480	2285480	I don't know what crimes are being committed when or what, what comedy is supposed to be.
2285480	2286480	I yeah.
2286480	2290960	I just think you never want to be too far from your, from who you are.
2290960	2295320	There's a thing, you know, with any performance and performers, I'm a big, everybody who know
2295320	2302080	me know I love wrestling and if any really good wrestlers are always like a turned up
2302080	2308640	version of themselves and I feel like that's what I try to be as a performer is that like,
2308640	2315640	you know, you usually catching me at my happiest, at my most jovial where I'm trying to have
2315640	2316640	fun.
2316640	2317640	Is that me 24 seven?
2317640	2318640	Not at all.
2318640	2319640	Right.
2319640	2323200	But that's when, what I'm trying to put forth at that time, you know, and I just try to make
2323200	2329640	sure that I'm, I think when you're, you as a human get too far away from your act, that's
2329640	2334040	when things start to crumble and fall apart from you in all and life and all regards.
2334040	2336280	And I just, that's why I write personally.
2336280	2338240	And that's why I try to change up my act.
2338240	2343680	And I never, I always, when I first started, I always hate it when I see a comedian perform
2343680	2350120	and it'd be like, uh, me and my girlfriend and then they go, Oh, I'm single and it's
2350120	2354640	like, I got married recently and then they bought you a coat.
2354640	2355640	Tell me the truth.
2355640	2357600	No, I don't trust anything that you're saying.
2357600	2358600	It is weird.
2358600	2363480	Like, I'm willing to go with you on any ride as long as you set up the rules and then follow
2363480	2365160	those fucking rules.
2365160	2366160	Yeah.
2366160	2370680	It is, it is weird because there was, there was that wave of standup where it was like,
2370680	2373000	it was like, we're not gestures anymore.
2373000	2377320	We're not, we're not wearing makeup and we're not, and it was even past then there was the,
2377320	2379320	you know, past the judy tenuta phase.
2379680	2384080	Like we're, we're, I love tenuta by the way, I'm not bagging on that phase.
2384080	2387480	I like Bob Goldthwaite's bed, you know, was part, it was like, there was that phase of
2387480	2390800	standup where it was like another form of purity where it was like, fuck it then we're
2390800	2391800	all characters.
2391800	2396160	You know, emo Phillips is an amazing joke writer and like, is he doing a character?
2396160	2397160	Is he not?
2397160	2400520	You meet him in person and you're like kind of the same guy, et cetera, like that kind
2400520	2407160	of like pedal to the metal character comedy where you're just performing in a more, more
2407160	2413400	of the Steve Martin tradition or, or even like the Steve Allen or the like who was the
2413400	2414400	guy with the fiddle?
2414400	2415400	God damn it.
2415400	2419920	The Henny Youngman kind of like, I'm going to tell a joke anyways, but the coming out
2419920	2426320	of that character phase, going into the alternative, like hands back in the pockets, look at the,
2426320	2429000	look at the floor and be real phase.
2429000	2435960	And then it was like it, the exploitation of that was I found, I always found very odd
2436000	2440920	when I was younger, when people would say they would purposely exploit the audience's
2440920	2446280	adaptation to the standup form by saying, I recently got engaged and knowing that everyone
2446280	2451640	would actually applaud, not because they believe in a construct, but because they actually
2451640	2455720	believe you because why would you stand on a stage in a sport jacket and tell people
2455720	2457680	you got engaged unless you recently did.
2457680	2462200	And then for your, and then to say to a goat and like have everybody go, Oh, I guess I'm
2462200	2463200	a piece of shit.
2463200	2465880	Like seems, yeah, I guess I'm just beating your dead horse.
2465880	2471680	Like, it's like, why, like I always found that very odd, but then again, I was a terrible
2471680	2472680	standup.
2472680	2473680	I could never write a joke to save my life.
2473680	2474680	Yeah.
2474680	2477280	To me, it just be like if a magician was showing you this trick and then it was just like,
2477280	2479680	no, I'm just fucking with you.
2479680	2484920	Dan, what was your best closer when you were, when you were a standup?
2484920	2486920	My standup was horrible.
2486920	2491320	Give me a closer.
2491320	2492320	Give me one of your clothes.
2492320	2493680	I was 17 years old.
2493680	2497880	I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, it was bad.
2497880	2499840	Shropp looks very excited about this.
2499840	2502280	You can't like, let's not even talk about it lately.
2502280	2504080	No, we can talk about it.
2504080	2507160	No, it was, give me, give me a closer.
2507160	2508600	I didn't have a fucking closer.
2508600	2510880	I would do a rap about masturbation.
2510880	2512080	Nice.
2512080	2514240	Raps are the first way you start.
2514240	2518920	It would, it would, it would make the audience would have applaud or I mean clap their hands.
2518920	2521200	No, thank you.
2521200	2522200	I did a rap.
2522200	2523200	I did a rap.
2523200	2526000	I did a game show that was stupid.
2526000	2531400	Ron, what was your first like shitty closer like that?
2531400	2536120	My very first set, I just talked about man boobs for like 10 minutes and then I was wearing
2536120	2539680	a red thing because I was doing my research.
2539680	2544440	I read a thing about how people would take pantyhose and cut off the crotch, put it over
2544440	2548440	their head and wear it as like a t-shirt to combat man boobs.
2548440	2554400	And so then at my thing was like, I would take off my shirt and I'd be wearing that.
2554400	2559960	It killed.
2559960	2560960	Because it's personal.
2560960	2561960	Yeah.
2561960	2563960	It's true in my life.
2563960	2570120	Speaking of physique, you and I both, we've been, we've been bigger than either of us
2570120	2571120	is now.
2571120	2572120	Is that right?
2572120	2573120	Grammar?
2573120	2574120	Did I use the right grammar?
2574120	2576560	Yeah, that was beautiful.
2576560	2578240	You were clearly a writer.
2578240	2588400	Do you want to, do you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you've been a lot bigger
2588400	2589400	physically.
2589400	2594000	Do you, like, I don't know anything about your, like, if you had epiphanies or if you
2594000	2597520	like just went on a crash diet or what, I have no idea.
2597520	2604200	I remember a deep, a deep past memory of you being, I don't know why you lost or how you
2604200	2605200	did it either.
2605960	2612720	I just started eating like shitty, like a carb carb free alcohol, sugar, candy bars,
2612720	2619520	and then like doing a crack leg lifts in my, in my living room.
2619520	2626000	But but did you, did you, did you, what, what did you do when and what kind of results did
2626000	2627000	you get?
2627000	2629160	Or we could sit or we don't have to make it a fitness podcast.
2629160	2630160	That's okay.
2630160	2631720	We could talk about a little bit.
2631720	2633160	That's why I wasn't sure it was you at that airport.
2633160	2636600	I was like, it looks like skinny Ron Funches is getting patted down over there.
2636600	2637600	Nice.
2641200	2642200	Okay.
2642200	2643200	Wait.
2643200	2644200	Wait.
2644200	2645200	Okay.
2645200	2646200	Let me ask you, this is an easier question about that same topic.
2646200	2655280	When you see a photo of yourself from years ago, does it, does it make you sad or happy
2655280	2661520	when you see a photo of yourself where you were like, where you look way bigger than
2661520	2663800	you are now in your mind's eye?
2663800	2668160	And so someone goes like, Hey, look at this photo from New Year's Eve years ago.
2668160	2672440	Like it, does it, does it, what, what emotional impact does that have on you?
2672440	2674320	It's a little range of emotions.
2674320	2681680	I mean, I, I'm proud of myself for, for making changes and for doing it, you know, just doing
2681680	2683600	the hard work to do that.
2683600	2685000	And that makes me proud.
2685000	2686760	It makes me sad.
2686760	2691120	Sometimes that I ever let myself get to that point because sometimes I, and it's not about
2691120	2695280	the way, but I can like look at the pictures and I can see my, my eyes and I can see like,
2695280	2697760	Oh, you don't look healthy at all.
2697760	2698760	You know?
2698760	2704040	And, and I just look back and I go, that was a bad time period in general, you know, psychologically.
2704040	2705040	Yeah.
2705040	2708440	Like you're smiling and you're supposedly happy, but you're, you're able to see.
2708440	2709440	Yeah.
2709440	2710440	Yeah.
2710440	2711640	I'm able to see and go like, Oh, you're upset about your divorce.
2711640	2713400	You're worried about your son.
2713400	2716200	You you're not eating healthy at all.
2716200	2720280	You know, you worked out once a year, you know?
2720280	2724560	And so it's just like looking at that person and then being like, Oh, I feel like you're
2724560	2725560	a little puppy.
2725560	2726560	I love you.
2726560	2727560	You know?
2727560	2732200	And, but now it just makes me focused to just keep at it and be healthy.
2732200	2736320	And my goal is to be, I want to be at my healthiest one term.
2736320	2739080	I mean, I'm 35, so I got, oh, fuck you.
2739080	2740080	Thank you.
2740080	2745880	I am aware that my success level is quick.
2745880	2755200	That's the greatest compliment we can give your generation.
2755200	2756200	Yeah.
2756200	2757200	Fuck you.
2757200	2758200	Yeah.
2758200	2759200	You think you're doing, get off my lawn.
2759200	2761200	That's what I yell now.
2761200	2762200	I love it.
2762200	2767840	Um, but my goal is to, I just want to be my healthiest when I turn 40.
2767840	2768840	That's my goal.
2768840	2773400	And I want to see, and then I'm on coast from there.
2773400	2774400	Do you have that?
2774400	2778360	I heard of me to ask as we were talking about hurtfulness and like, uh, Oh, taking down
2778360	2780200	other people, hurting other people, all that stuff.
2780200	2781840	But what about self abuse?
2781840	2786120	Like, like, what's your, what do you struggle with any kind of like, do you have the capacity
2786120	2789840	and you don't like hurt yourself, say bad stuff to yourself?
2789840	2794760	I've learned, that's been one thing I really have learned to shy away from and I don't
2794760	2798200	really, um, enjoy it around me.
2798200	2803000	Like people who are around me generally know that like, I don't, like if you put yourself
2803000	2805760	down around me, I will be like, Hey, we don't, don't do that.
2805760	2807360	You can do that on your own time.
2807360	2808800	We don't do that here.
2808800	2809800	To other people.
2809800	2810800	Yeah.
2810800	2811840	Because I just like, I don't like it.
2811840	2813360	I don't enjoy it.
2813360	2817920	I don't, I used to do it a lot, but it never served anything.
2817920	2825440	Is it because, so if I put myself down around you, are you, is it just your empathy and
2825440	2827040	going, Hey, don't put yourself down.
2827040	2829440	Are you actually thinking, you know what?
2829440	2832960	Like Sarah Silverman told me at one point, she's like, you know, some people are like,
2832960	2838280	self loathing and self, uh, love or whatever the opposite supposedly is.
2838280	2839280	It's all the same.
2839280	2840280	Bullshit.
2840280	2841280	Yeah.
2841280	2842280	It's your head way up your ass.
2842280	2843280	Yeah.
2843280	2846920	Like she was working with young me and was like calling me out right away.
2846920	2850840	I was like, yeah, what the fuck is the difference between you hating yourself and loving yourself?
2850840	2851840	It's all about you.
2851840	2857560	You going, Oh, look at me and it's like, who, who are you to judge you?
2857560	2859480	You don't get the fucking judge.
2859480	2864760	And to me, to what is, when I talk about the people around me, um, or, or people I've
2864760	2869040	dated or think around me, I've always been like, look, I, I like you.
2869040	2870880	I like being around you.
2870880	2874160	So if you're telling me, yeah, you're telling me this stuff.
2874160	2875360	Are you telling me I'm wrong?
2875360	2876360	Right.
2876360	2879120	Like, are you telling me I'm a bad judge of character?
2879120	2883120	Because one thing I've learned from my mom and from my mom being an abusive relationship
2883120	2887480	and shit like that is if someone tells you who they are, fucking believe them.
2887480	2891560	So if you tell me you're a piece of shit, I will believe you.
2891560	2893480	So you either do or don't.
2893480	2894480	Right.
2894480	2895480	Yeah.
2895480	2899320	You may as well just yes and them because like, if, if you, you don't want to get into
2899320	2904720	a tango with them where your job becomes to talk them out of it, that's not going to help
2904720	2905720	them worry.
2905720	2912760	It's a waste of my energy where life is rough no matter why do we have to, um, and our brains
2912760	2917280	are so fucking powerful, you know, like I can't fight.
2917280	2921360	You can do things that change your reality, but I can't fight your perspective for you.
2921360	2922360	You know, right?
2922360	2923360	I can't fight your brain.
2923360	2924360	Yeah.
2924360	2926320	Spencer, who's like a really big fan of yours.
2926320	2927320	It's a bummer.
2927320	2928320	He's not here.
2928320	2929320	I know.
2929320	2930320	I love Spencer.
2930320	2935760	Uh, he, he said something like many years ago, which is like really like he's, he, we,
2935760	2940480	we kind of plucked him out of his parents, uh, basement and took him on tour in the,
2940480	2942240	in the movie I made about myself.
2942240	2946460	I know that's, uh, there's nothing healthy about any of it, but I, but I remember him
2946460	2951980	like in the context of that documentary, like, like actually having a valuable takeaway
2951980	2959840	from it, which I never got, which is, uh, you know, everybody is so focused on themselves.
2959840	2964100	They have such shit to work out so many things to worry about with themselves.
2964100	2969420	They're not, you, you may feel like they're thinking about you, but they're not so caught
2969420	2975660	up in you and there's, there's something there that's more like, it's like you can, you can
2975660	2980420	understand that, but realizing that, i.e. making it real takes therapy.
2980420	2981420	It takes a bit.
2981420	2986980	Or like, just go take a piss in the street, like legit, like you could just do it.
2986980	2988100	See who stops you.
2988100	2990100	No one.
2990100	2996500	Yeah, go, go, go broke and like, and ask for a quarter and the corner and see how many
2996500	3004420	people are caught up in your, yeah, have a family member die, but be a family member
3004420	3005420	that dies.
3005420	3006420	Yeah.
3006420	3011780	See how quickly people move on.
3011780	3012780	They're teflon.
3012780	3013780	Yeah.
3013780	3016460	You don't have to worry about your scrambled eggs dirtying anyone's pants.
3016460	3019300	You're going to slip right off of them.
3019300	3026980	It's almost worse news than you thought, um, but are you, are you, are you in therapy regularly?
3026980	3027980	Yeah.
3027980	3035580	Shout out to Donna.
3035580	3040740	How do you know, like my therapist at the end of my last couple sessions, now this is
3040740	3046540	not a humble brag because I obviously need more therapy than anybody, but I, my therapist
3046540	3051460	last couple of sessions is she's done this thing where she goes, so you want to schedule,
3051460	3052460	what do you want to do?
3052460	3055740	You want to schedule next week, uh, next month?
3055740	3059020	And I kind of, like, I'm wondering, like, is it like a chiropractor where eventually
3059020	3063660	they go like, look, you're, you know what you're supposed to be doing.
3063660	3068140	Like, like my job isn't to do it for you 50 minutes a week.
3068140	3070620	So why are you fucking coming in here?
3070620	3071620	Yeah.
3071620	3075420	Like I've tried, do you go to your therapist once a week or do you, did you taper off a
3075420	3076420	little bit?
3076420	3079020	I've seen her once a week for a, for a little bit.
3079020	3084340	And then now it's been like once a month, once every few weeks, just to check in every
3084340	3085340	now and again.
3085340	3089220	Or if I feel like I need more, of course I'll be like, Hey, let's schedule.
3089220	3093660	So I think it's just, yeah, I think it all just depends about what you need, you know,
3093660	3098820	I kind of felt like my, my, my personal journey, like at this point from talking to her, I'm
3098820	3104580	like, I said to her, well look, I'm, I think it would be a mistake for me to like go, Oh,
3104580	3108140	uh, I'll only come to therapy when my life is so dramatic.
3108140	3111780	I have something to talk to you about because it seems like my biggest challenge right now
3111780	3116940	is I need to become a native of boredom.
3116940	3118660	I need to, I need to stop.
3118660	3120020	I have the compulsion.
3120020	3126500	I feel like like happiness has come to me and I have a neurological compulsion.
3126500	3130460	I want to, I want to make things dramatic so that I know what to do.
3130460	3132140	Like I have a role to play.
3132140	3135900	If somebody, somebody, somebody tell me I'm behind schedule so I can fucking tell them
3135900	3137840	that it doesn't matter.
3137840	3139620	And it's like, no, like once you get things,
3139620	3142500	I think that's part of the, even the therapy, right?
3142500	3149340	Like even the, the transition is a lot of it going like you gotta let go of realities
3149340	3151740	and old paths and things that don't serve you anymore.
3151740	3154860	And if that's not true, then, then why do that?
3154860	3162340	If you've worked so hard or fallen luckily into or whatever the situation is, you know,
3162340	3165620	you know, I don't trust older white people.
3166620	3173300	How dare you not know how hard I clawed my way up to 35 year old piece of shit.
3176060	3177220	I am Spartacus.
3178220	3180420	It's like, we all, we all, that's how I feel.
3180420	3181380	We're all Spartacus.
3181380	3181860	Come on.
3181860	3183900	I'm like, you don't know what I've done.
3185140	3185820	No, it's true.
3185820	3187140	I mean, that's what the times have been.
3187140	3189180	These are like, it's like, it doesn't really matter.
3189180	3190860	Like privilege, not privilege.
3190860	3195420	The one thing that we all have in common is that someone implying that your privilege
3195420	3196860	is deeply offensive to you.
3196860	3204260	You can be like, you could be born on a pile of beautiful like cloud and like it would
3204260	3208660	still, the most human part of you is the part of you that would be like, what are you talking
3208660	3208940	about?
3208940	3214020	If somebody said to you, Hey, you, you, you, uh, you've had it good, like, like, like the
3214020	3215540	part of you that was like, what?
3215540	3216020	Fuck you.
3216020	3219860	No, uh, that would be the one part of you that's connected to everybody else, which
3219860	3221220	is deeply unfortunate.
3222020	3224940	I, I, I'm still trying to get accustomed to that.
3224980	3230580	I, I, it's like, like this underdog story that I've crafted for myself, you know, like
3230620	3232180	everybody's an underdog in comedy.
3232180	3233580	We were just talking about that a minute ago.
3233580	3235780	It's like, yeah, that no matter.
3235780	3240900	That's what I've been trying to transition from is that, um, you, you work so hard,
3240900	3242540	especially if you're, you don't live in LA.
3242540	3244500	You're like, I want to get here, get here, get here.
3244500	3245860	And it's like, I have my story.
3245860	3249940	And it's like, well, every fucking person that made it to where you are has a story.
3249940	3251340	So your story doesn't matter anymore.
3251340	3253780	It's almost like, thank God for some of the most horrible people in the world.
3253780	3255260	Thank God for in cells.
3255260	3259780	Thank God, but for, for actually like taking that off of the plate, taking that out of
3259780	3264500	the buffet, because you can't be outraged about it's, it's like, oh, that has a voice
3264500	3265260	that has a face.
3265260	3266140	And it's not funny.
3266580	3267460	It's not heroic.
3267460	3273100	It's not noble that I, the idea that, oh, you, you, you, your, your unfuckability is
3273100	3277220	hilarious or dramatic or a story at all.
3277620	3281620	Maybe your unfuckability is just, it's just a thing that you need to work on.
3281620	3287900	Yeah, be about something, get a craft, get a passion.
3287900	3292340	As we look back through our comedic archive, what we see are things that would one day
3292340	3298780	become manifestos of terrorists who like played out as like hilarious 10 minute standup
3298780	3300340	sets in front of a brick wall.
3301940	3303340	Well, that's dramatic.
3303340	3310300	Well, I guess what I'm saying is comedy does not age well and the extent to which it does
3310300	3313820	not age well increases by six years per month.
3313980	3317020	Yeah, Ron, like you've been doing standup for a long time.
3317180	3322220	Do you look back at like jokes that you did a long time ago and the shit that just didn't
3322220	3326620	age well, that you like, is there anything you regret or have you always kept it pretty
3327180	3329660	like, like you didn't cross the line?
3329660	3331940	I think any art form, right?
3331940	3336340	If you don't look back at it and go, oh, I fucking am better now and I wish I had done
3336340	3338140	things better now, you're not growing.
3338140	3340060	So it's like, that's just part of it.
3340060	3345620	And I think, I mean, but I don't go back and go like, oh, I used to be a Nazi.
3345660	3352180	No, I might not have been as good at communicating what I was doing.
3354100	3357100	I thought you were really funny back in your Nazi era.
3359580	3364060	I mean, politics aside, it was actually just great craftsmanship.
3364300	3365300	Thank you.
3366300	3367420	Yeah, Philip Glass.
3367420	3371580	You know, if you listen to if you if you decode his numeric symphonies these days,
3371580	3375980	it actually ciphers into a horrible condemnation of his earliest works.
3375980	3377860	He's like, what was I thinking?
3377860	3382180	And I just thought that was I don't know, I just don't like the Beastie boy.
3383380	3386180	Your joke was the Philip Glass of jokes.
3386900	3388060	I just wanted to pick an artist.
3388060	3390980	I thought it would be funny if Philip Glass was like, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I
3390980	3394500	was doing. Like he was like, I'm sorry, that was really bad of me.
3395780	3400060	Oh, when you went, yeah, what was I doing?
3402100	3409140	All right, so you got your we got your Comedy Central special, which we were going to plug.
3409140	3410460	And now we're plugging.
3410460	3411900	We're plugging. Go back and watch it.
3411900	3414660	Oh, yeah. On a website.
3414700	3415620	I want to talk about this.
3415620	3416980	I follow you on Instagram.
3416980	3420260	So I see these clips of you doing this getting better thing.
3420260	3421380	We talk about getting better.
3421380	3423340	I love that. That's the only way I'm familiar with it.
3423340	3425180	What is that? It's my podcast.
3425740	3427540	I just talk to people that I like.
3428180	3429340	Sometimes it's my mom.
3429340	3430180	I've never been on it.
3431780	3434180	Oh, don't make it like that from the get go.
3434180	3437300	Does it? I'm just setting you up for one of your.
3437300	3438860	He talks to people that he likes.
3438860	3439860	Yeah, I know.
3441300	3443220	I know. Thank you.
3445820	3450020	I just talk to people and ask them about their process about getting better.
3450020	3451300	He talks to cool people.
3451300	3452740	He talks to people that are awesome.
3452740	3454060	Yeah, he talks to people.
3454060	3457740	But he wants to hang out with on a regular basis from the clips.
3457740	3461020	I see the themes do seem to surround actually getting better,
3461020	3463020	not just idle chitchat.
3463020	3467540	Like you actually are specifically talking to people about self-improvement
3467540	3471740	and how they were worse than they are now and where they got to
3471740	3474500	and how they and how they got there and where they want to go to.
3474500	3478540	And they continue struggles from achieving your dreams
3478540	3482340	and then having new dreams or health things or or whatever.
3482340	3484620	I talk to a lot of different people about different things,
3484620	3486660	but can you give me any tips as an interviewer?
3488220	3489860	I'm going to interrupt people.
3494380	3496140	I don't know if that wiggle dance is earned.
3496140	3500340	I. Yeah, good chemistry.
3502340	3504220	I'd make a pretty good guest, I think.
3504220	3506300	Yeah, please come on.
3506300	3508980	It's too late. I invited myself. I'll never come on.
3508980	3510700	You can't ask to be on getting better.
3510700	3513260	Exactly. That's why I don't want to ever be on it.
3513260	3515420	I'm getting worse.
3515420	3518300	Well, then definitely don't come on.
3518300	3521580	I'm your magneto now.
3521580	3523940	I will be out in the street crushing Nazi heads
3523940	3526540	because of a weird projection I have.
3526540	3528700	Thank you, ma'am.
3528700	3531900	Well, please fulfill my collection.
3531900	3534860	We've had Danny Pudi, we've had Nicole Brown.
3534860	3537180	You can come help fill in that world.
3537180	3540540	Yeah, but are you about the production itself?
3540700	3543140	Because it's on video.
3543140	3545780	How does the are you producing it with anybody?
3545780	3546900	No, it's just all me.
3546900	3549300	It's not making any money.
3549300	3551820	What do you do? You set up a camera and a tripod?
3551820	3553220	Yeah, just in my office.
3553220	3555220	We put on YouTube and iTunes.
3555220	3556620	It looks and sounds perfect.
3556620	3558620	Thank you. My producer is really good.
3558620	3559420	He does a good job.
3559420	3561700	That's why he's the only one that makes money.
3561700	3565660	Dan, Dan, Dan, you're not going to be on the show.
3566540	3568380	I don't. I already said I don't want to be.
3568380	3569540	That's why these compliments are amazing.
3569540	3572220	Don't try to nag me into being on the show.
3572220	3575420	Of course I would love to have you.
3575420	3579300	Oh, you think I don't want to talk to a successful weirdo about his weird success?
3579300	3580780	I will never, ever.
3583060	3585500	Let's talk to Rob Schwab about something.
3585500	3586860	Yes, sitting over here languishing.
3586860	3587740	You've been very quiet.
3587740	3590500	It's kind of like I'm trying to be better.
3592620	3595100	Is it because you go in the Reddit and you read?
3595100	3595940	Don't go on the Reddit.
3595940	3598740	I don't have to. Reddit comes to me.
3598740	3599900	How in what form?
3599900	3601340	No, it's just I don't know.
3601340	3605020	It's just I what I always tell people don't go on the Reddit.
3605220	3609340	There's an interesting topic like, do you do you do you peruse?
3609380	3610740	Do you self Google?
3610740	3613220	Do you I don't usually self Google.
3613220	3616660	Sometimes you find things randomly just on accident.
3617460	3621020	Somebody review my special and I didn't like it because they they
3621660	3623020	I don't care about.
3623020	3625020	I mean, they should let people do what they want.
3625220	3628100	But I didn't like the fact that they they were like,
3628100	3629660	I think this guy is a phony.
3629660	3632060	And I think this guy isn't who he says he is.
3632900	3635780	And then they call my son and then they go, I know, even though I never met him.
3635980	3638580	And then they and then they call my son weird.
3638820	3640580	And then I was like, fuck you.
3640580	3643180	I'm going to fucking get in your face online.
3643220	3646380	So they got they got I don't want to say they got you or triggered.
3646380	3647300	Yeah, they triggered me.
3647300	3649700	And then they were just happy because this was the first time
3649700	3652020	anyone had fucking read their articles.
3652260	3656460	And so I was like, oh, I thought it was an article where they semi legit.
3656460	3660020	No, it was some guy I would say for for real.
3660300	3664700	It was Pace magazine, which is not me who cares exactly.
3664700	3668700	What is it? Well, I, I, I, I, we care now.
3668700	3671820	But the I had been interviews and shit with them before.
3671820	3673860	And the main comedy guy had always been cool with it.
3673860	3676340	So it kind of that's one reason I triggered me.
3676860	3680780	But I guess that guy went on vacation and they had an assistant comedy
3681220	3686100	reviewer who was some open miker and he just fucking was like, oh,
3686460	3688580	that answers every question, doesn't it?
3688580	3692940	Yeah, he also said that he felt the only generation's only good comic
3692940	3697340	was Lisa Lampanelli, which is just a weird thing to say.
3697340	3699020	I love Lisa Lampanelli.
3699020	3701740	It's a it's a weird thing to say whether you love Lisa or not.
3701740	3703820	Yeah, because it's like a weird thing.
3703820	3706500	Why do you get to review comedy then?
3706500	3708180	And how is that?
3708180	3711700	How is the art of the critic like support the idea of like, well,
3711700	3713300	here's an empirical statement I'll make.
3713300	3714900	Well, then you're not a very good critic, are you?
3715020	3718660	Not at all. You're more of a weird scientist who's like practicing
3718660	3719940	a medicine that doesn't exist.
3719940	3723740	His whole summary, he when he tweeted it out was like, I reviewed
3723740	3726100	Ron Funch's comic special, which was OK.
3726100	3729180	I was like, that is not a review.
3729180	3731660	Either like it or not like it.
3732060	3733420	Just saying it's OK.
3733420	3735940	It's just you're a fucking milk toast piece of shit.
3735940	3738260	Yeah. So it triggered me.
3738260	3739660	And so to answer your question.
3739660	3741060	Yeah, sometimes I look.
3741060	3743460	But do you do so?
3743460	3748660	So do you so then do you do you pull back from that as a matter of?
3748660	3750900	Yeah, my girlfriend's really good at that.
3750900	3755420	She tried to make me realize how blessed I am and how good I have it.
3755420	3758980	And to just she's like these people are just trying to knock you off
3758980	3760580	your course and leave it alone.
3760580	3765980	This is something feel wrong about that, that that like as a person
3765980	3770180	who wants to hold a microphone and connect with people that you then
3770180	3776420	by virtue of your chosen path, that you in order to do it well,
3776780	3783540	that you're not allowed to do what regular ass people do, which is go on Reddit.
3783780	3786340	Yeah. Doesn't it seem wrong?
3786340	3787580	I don't like it.
3787580	3788980	Oh, there's nothing.
3788980	3792340	I don't like this because I always like I mean, I still occasionally
3792340	3795220	would do it because I just like to remind people that we're human beings.
3795220	3796380	I'm a person just like you.
3796380	3797340	You can't just tell me.
3797340	3799660	You can't just say anything to me.
3799660	3801060	You can. You're right.
3801060	3802980	But I will respond to you.
3802980	3806820	But then the whole thing, then it becomes stupid because you respond.
3806820	3809380	And then the nice thing, you know, there's some fucking blog that's like,
3809540	3811260	right? Oh, man.
3811260	3813740	You've got Ron Fungus is on a tirade.
3813740	3815940	And then people like, who the fuck is Ron Fungus?
3815940	3818260	God damn. Oh, man.
3818500	3821340	Hey, Sonny, I'm older than you.
3821340	3825540	Yeah, I've like any any that that is the fucking worst.
3825860	3828860	When you're like like that, read it was like because you're in box
3828860	3832740	and then you would just go like, hey, what if you just respond to go
3833020	3834940	human being over here or whatever?
3834940	3838700	And then it was like, oh, shit, this did make a really handy
3838700	3844940	like click and drag over to look over here to what Dan Harmon said to a fan.
3845220	3848020	They're like, well, not I didn't mean it. Oh, fuck.
3848020	3851780	Yeah, they just cut one thing out and then is everything else?
3851940	3854460	I don't know what I don't know what.
3855100	3856820	I'm still dealing with this shit.
3856820	3858380	Like, I don't know what.
3858380	3860300	Yeah, you deleted your shit for a while.
3860300	3861660	I deleted my Twitter.
3861660	3863380	I deleted my Twitter the morning.
3863380	3864300	Why, Dan?
3864300	3867020	I deleted my Twitter the morning that James Gunn got fired
3867780	3871260	because the headline was James Gunn gets fired for nine
3871660	3873380	for tweets from nine years ago.
3873380	3875660	And I was like, nope.
3876660	3879460	I said, not not why I signed up for Twitter.
3879460	3882020	Not why I fucking worked for nine years.
3882020	3886900	And I spent I like wrote my limo to San Diego to Comic Con that weekend.
3887820	3891340	I'm archiving all my tweets and then deleting my baller.
3891540	3893340	Yeah. And I was so happy.
3893340	3895900	I spent the entire Comic Con going.
3895900	3896940	People would go, how are you doing?
3896940	3898260	I'm like, I'm fucking good.
3898260	3900020	Like, I just deleted my Twitter.
3900020	3901060	They're like, what?
3901060	3904580	And I'm like, yeah, I fucking James Gunn thing just like made me go.
3904820	3907700	This is not I don't want to fucking deal with this and all this shit.
3907980	3911300	And then I came back home and like got on Instagram
3911700	3915460	and there was an Instagram comment from somebody saying, hey,
3915580	3918420	just letting you know, sure, don't kill the messenger.
3918420	3919420	But
3920380	3922420	everyone's saying that you deleted your Twitter account
3922420	3925900	because you're a pedophile and you did this thing and all this stuff.
3925900	3928820	And then I like found out about this.
3928820	3934620	Like it was like like these like like four chain people.
3934620	3937100	Like like I deleted my Twitter account.
3937660	3939740	Yes, because James Gunn got fired.
3939740	3941860	So therefore go ahead and link it to.
3942380	3943900	Yeah. And I did.
3944220	3947420	It was it was like they were like, why did Dan Harmon
3947420	3949100	just deleted his Twitter account?
3949100	3952460	And then someone goes, why did he do that?
3952460	3953540	What does he have to hide?
3953540	3957500	L.O.L. And then someone responded with maybe this.
3957740	3959460	And then they started pushing it out.
3959460	3961180	And my account was already deleted.
3961180	3963860	So I was like, oh, fuck, what?
3964580	3966220	OK, what do I do?
3966220	3967820	Phone ringing off the hook.
3967820	3971100	Publicists like lawyers.
3971380	3972460	It's everybody.
3972460	3975580	Are you who are going to deal with this?
3975860	3978620	So and I was I was in the back alley of this show.
3978620	3979660	There's a show.
3979660	3982460	I wish I could mark the episode because I came out here
3982460	3986300	because the decision was it for the first time in my life.
3986300	3988780	And that's why all this stuff makes me so sad
3988780	3992140	because my my entire MO was always be as honest as possible.
3992260	3993980	Always be honest.
3993980	3995780	And for the first time in my life,
3995780	3999340	the way to fight dishonesty was to say nothing.
4000180	4003380	And it just hurts so bad.
4003780	4006740	And I like came out here, but it wasn't the right decision.
4007300	4011980	After 48 hours of like, you wouldn't believe the fucking calls like,
4012260	4014300	hey, Dan, it's me, Mike Thompson.
4014300	4019340	I got I got crisis interventionist, the Stafford, the Liam, half up nothing.
4019540	4023220	He's a little bit like people that are like, hey, so listen, here's the thing.
4023220	4025620	Like, does anybody know for sure you're a pedophile?
4025620	4028060	Like, what are you talking about?
4028060	4029580	None of this is real.
4029580	4033420	Like, like, just let me tell people you got any pictures of you not touching.
4037580	4041260	Meanwhile, the 48 hour clock goes by.
4041260	4045860	So the New York Times, the thing that made me lose hope in all of humanity
4046460	4050860	was the day that the New York Times, who had contacted my publicist
4050860	4054100	for a comment about it, they're like, hey, what's going on with this thing?
4054580	4058180	And my publicist said, he's not commenting right now
4058180	4063540	because I'm sitting in my kitchen like on a speaker phone going like, OK,
4063540	4068220	so what do I do to not get fired by a cartoon network, AT&T, all this stuff?
4068220	4069260	Like, what are we doing?
4069260	4070620	How do we coordinate?
4070620	4074980	How do I get Cartoon Network to say we support him
4075340	4079700	so that they don't pull a Disney so that we don't continue this fucking slide?
4080180	4083300	And and we're brokering apologies.
4083860	4087540	And I finished brokering one in back appropriately
4087540	4090220	by the fucking dumpster and behind this theater
4090220	4093060	and then came out on this stage and did a show where I said nothing.
4093060	4095420	And it basically said nothing until now.
4095420	4101580	And but but it was like in the 48 hours
4101580	4104060	where his Twitter account is deleted.
4104060	4109460	And so then it's like the story is like Dan Harmon deletes his Twitter account
4110180	4117820	after video surfaces of him fucking a baby doll nine years ago.
4117820	4120300	Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember this.
4121940	4125380	And it was like, no, that's not true.
4125380	4129620	Dan Harmon deletes his Twitter account there for video surfaces.
4129620	4131820	But how complicated is that story?
4131820	4135780	Well, The New York Times, like that was the point was like The New York Times
4135780	4139940	like like just kind of ran with that story, like inherent in the headlight
4139940	4143820	like Dan Harmon deletes Twitter account after video surfaces
4143820	4150700	because they they got that from Breitbart from like all of these people.
4150700	4153660	It was like this inherently cause effect timeline to it.
4153660	4156100	I'm like, no, Dan Harmon deletes Twitter account
4156100	4160180	because James Gunn got fired for tweeting about fucking kids.
4160180	4162740	And Dan Harmon knows that he's not going to stand up to that test.
4162740	4165060	And Dan Harmon wants nothing to do with Twitter anymore.
4165220	4169020	And once Dan Harmon leaves, it's time to hit that pinata on the way out the door.
4169020	4171460	So Dan Harmon regrets leaving Twitter in the first place
4171460	4175540	because he didn't know that you could shutter your window to fucking crystal
4175540	4179900	knocked and have people just kick in your door like I like.
4179900	4186940	But and there's no way to like come out and scream that without making things worse,
4186940	4188820	making things more clickable.
4188820	4193940	The only way to win that fight, which a fight I never wanted to have,
4193940	4196980	is to be silent. Yeah, which is something I've never done.
4196980	4199660	Wait for the next thing to come along.
4199660	4204300	Like it was like, oh, so this is how you living well is best revenge.
4205340	4207220	Just just grin and bear it.
4207220	4208780	Don't feel the fire.
4208780	4210500	Don't kick up dust around it.
4210500	4213780	Your contract's not signed yet. All this stuff.
4213780	4217220	It was like like like like this isn't within.
4217220	4218540	What am I then?
4218540	4222860	And what age have we entered where where honesty is no longer the best policy?
4222980	4226380	Where the people whose names on their accounts on social media
4226380	4228260	are the same as their birth certificate.
4228260	4233340	The people who say what went on with them yesterday for real are are like
4233500	4238620	their word is weighed less than hordes of people with fake accounts
4238620	4242980	that just want to like if if enough dust gets kicked up around you on the Internet,
4243300	4245020	you can get fired.
4245020	4248500	I I really I remain to this day.
4248500	4251380	Every night I sit in bed playing cookie collector on Minecraft
4251380	4252860	and just thinking about it.
4252860	4254540	I have no idea where to file it.
4254540	4256540	I don't know how to feel.
4256540	4258580	People get shot, though, so who cares?
4260940	4264140	I mean, yeah, so so I mean, good point.
4264540	4269740	So we've entered an era where I have to go from being happy
4269740	4272940	about being honest to being thankful I'm not shot yet.
4273180	4275540	Yeah, that's where we are.
4275540	4277460	That's really where we are as a country.
4277460	4279860	That feels real real bad.
4279980	4281860	It does.
4285620	4288660	My favorite part, though, I know if I do,
4288660	4292140	I don't mean to just kind of not be empathetic to what you're going through.
4292140	4292860	That is horrible.
4292860	4294500	And I've only experienced a very small way.
4294500	4298540	And I know how it made me feel and how did you get like, well,
4298540	4299460	what are you referring to?
4299460	4301580	Not just people just talking a lot of trash.
4301580	4304820	And you are just particular and people are like, you know who you say you are.
4304820	4308540	I'm like, I don't know how to prove this or make you think
4308540	4310060	who I am, who I am.
4310060	4312100	And so it's just small things.
4312100	4315980	But my thing, my favorite part about this story is that that you
4316180	4319380	there was a moment that you must have had where you were
4319380	4322500	this James Gunn thing came out and then you went.
4323500	4325700	Oh, shit, there's a video of me fucking a baby dog.
4327620	4329220	Actually, that was the last thing on my mind.
4329220	4331580	No, no, I didn't think about that at all.
4332020	4333660	I was I was surprised.
4333660	4335220	I was like, oh, that video.
4335220	4337740	I was like, I was like, God damn,
4337740	4341980	I did a good job mixing that sound if we go through Channel 101 stuff.
4341980	4344100	We committed loads of crimes.
4344100	4345540	No, I totally forgot about that.
4345540	4347540	I had deleted that video.
4347540	4350260	I shot that video in the community offices.
4350460	4351620	It was 2009.
4351620	4354580	I was like, it's a month after it was on Channel 101.
4354580	4357700	I was like, that needs to come down if I'm going to be in the business
4357700	4361020	that Tina Fey is in, like I am not I am a political figure now.
4361020	4361740	I'm visible.
4361740	4363620	I need to not be doing this anymore.
4363620	4365140	I'm not Johnny Rotten anymore.
4365140	4367340	I can't I took it down.
4367340	4372780	And someone but someone had someone had some admirable fucking like Captain
4372780	4376580	Crunch kept it in their Davy Jones locker for all that time next to their crunch
4376580	4377580	berries.
4378380	4382780	I was what I was thinking was more much more appropriately
4382780	4386540	was nine years of tweets.
4387180	4389020	I was I wasn't thinking about videos.
4389020	4394980	I was thinking about nine years of being actively reacting to society in the moment.
4395700	4398060	No way I'm going to hold up to that test.
4398060	4399500	No, absolutely not.
4399500	4401300	Yeah, none of us really.
4401300	4402580	I mean, maybe me.
4402580	4404980	So I thought, yeah, maybe you.
4404980	4410540	Yeah, I thought briefly about like the idea of going through and like going
4410860	4412780	this one, no, that one, no, that one.
4412780	4418340	And then it was like, no, no, no, that would take three years to go through nine
4418340	4421780	years of tweets and go, oh, this one, no, no.
4421780	4425500	And I was like, no, the only right thing to do here is like abscond.
4425500	4429060	That's been one of the kind of like greatest tricks that's been played
4429060	4432860	in the last few years is the shift of responsibility.
4432860	4438620	Like it was our job not to necessarily be reckless and again to not be harmful
4438620	4443460	and cause cause pain, but our our job to test boundaries and have fun
4443460	4447020	and to just say whatever reckless thing that we're say.
4447300	4452060	And then we're supposed to be checked in by the real people who are in charge.
4452220	4455300	And now it's like the people who are in charge just say whatever the fuck.
4455300	4457100	And they lie and they do whatever.
4457100	4458340	And no one really checks that.
4458340	4461540	And it's just like, no, we're scrutinized, you know.
4461700	4464980	But by the end of the day, it kind of lets me know that it's all kind of pointless
4464980	4469220	because like if if it really had a power, like then there'd be so many
4469660	4472740	powerful people who have been already like truly powerful people
4472740	4476260	who would have been taken down by, you know, like I'll give it some time.
4476260	4479300	I'm OK. I'll be patient.
4479300	4482900	I mean, it is pretty easy to get somebody fired right now.
4482900	4484580	We haven't changed that part of our culture.
4484580	4486620	That depends on their value, I believe.
4486620	4490180	Like if people it's like any sports team.
4490220	4494940	Well, a human being a human being's value should be like they should not be able
4494940	4500380	to get fired because a bunch of people on Twitter set fire on that.
4501380	4505980	Well, I mean, ideally, I'm not talking about what reality I'm saying.
4506340	4510540	Like what your mailman shouldn't get fired
4510540	4515540	because he tweets something that goes viral.
4515540	4518700	That I just in an ideal universe that shouldn't be the case.
4518700	4523020	So many things. Well, you can go with that, though, because then by that stance,
4523500	4527340	if some if a cop that's like a racist cop
4527700	4532780	knows to tweet out racist things, shouldn't should they be held accountable for that?
4532900	4536940	I mean, that's I mean, that's that's dumb applause.
4538700	4540380	No, that's I mean, a cop is like,
4540380	4544260	yeah, it's like it's like bring it back to mailman so I can control this.
4546300	4549940	But it's no, that's I mean, we talked about like the weather man.
4549940	4554340	I made the joke because the weatherman that stumbled over Martin Luther King's name.
4554340	4556660	And did you were you cognizant of that?
4557660	4560180	And I was like, oh, you didn't know about that.
4560820	4564500	It was like he he there was there was actually two separate guys.
4565020	4566260	It was like he was talking.
4566260	4569180	He said tried to say Martin Luther King's name because he was saying,
4569180	4571580	like, by the way, there's a celebration of this park or whatever.
4571580	4574340	He said he said Coon instead of King.
4574340	4577340	And like while he was saying the name and it went viral.
4577660	4579980	And the weatherman lost his job.
4579980	4584820	And I am like, is that how we find out people are racist?
4584820	4587940	And then I made the joke of like, isn't that the one job
4587940	4590660	where you could safely be racist as a weatherman?
4590660	4591500	Yeah, yeah.
4591500	4593380	Because like, what are you going to do in charge?
4593380	4594100	Yeah. Yeah.
4594100	4597460	Like, are you going to not tell Mexican people it's raining?
4599460	4603500	See, I still I can still do stand up if I the white weather's OK.
4606100	4608060	Seventy eight degrees again.
4609380	4611420	But I mean, obviously, yeah, they say great.
4611420	4615500	It's like we don't we we want we we want our cops to not be racist.
4615500	4617540	Obviously, that's a truism.
4617540	4621620	Therefore, if a cop in his private life is on social media
4621620	4626580	and reflects racism on his Facebook page with some post or even a retweet,
4626940	4629540	then it's yeah, it's rough.
4629540	4631020	It's just a slippery slope.
4631020	4632580	We're dealing with new problems.
4632580	4635300	It's fun. Yeah, it's fun.
4635300	4637980	Yeah, I hope it stays fun.
4639860	4644700	I I don't want to live in a world where
4645020	4650100	it where the people that are in control of who
4651740	4656380	profits, who's plugged into the the hive mind and who's excommunicated,
4656380	4662580	where I worry about buying a ticket to this ride, where it's
4662940	4665100	we've already seen, I feel like
4667980	4670660	the nefarious among us.
4670660	4672780	Let's call them right wing people,
4672780	4676540	people who are nihilistic a little bit about politics and ideology
4676540	4681780	and the way that we interact with media, that they can actually hack, as it were,
4682980	4687300	the leftist mindset by, for instance, saying, hey,
4687900	4691740	what if I were to tell you that this person, by your definitions,
4691740	4696540	is technically this or that wouldn't you want them
4696540	4701100	to then by your own rules, suffer or divide or compartmentalize?
4701460	4703700	And they're enjoying that right now.
4703700	4706260	And it's really distressing to watch them
4708300	4710780	grow. Yeah. Yeah.
4711980	4715260	So and I guess I can predict what you're going to say is,
4715860	4719180	yeah, it's that's fun.
4719860	4722180	No, that's not fun.
4722180	4723620	OK, I predicted wrong.
4723620	4725340	Yeah, no, it's not fun.
4725340	4728220	I mean, there's lessons to be learned and just that like.
4731740	4733140	And overcoming that.
4733140	4738500	And I think overall, like it gets so complicated when you break it down
4738500	4743100	into like, like all that type of stuff was right wing and social media.
4743100	4745700	But at the end of the day, it's all about separatism.
4745700	4750300	It's all about trying to separate people from from so that they just stay
4750300	4753900	in these little boxes so that a small amount of people can screw the rest of us
4753900	4757740	over. So if you're just like, whether I'm going like, oh, I don't trust you
4757740	4760620	because you're a white man or you don't trust me because I'm black
4760860	4765580	or women doesn't feel safe around around anyone, then then like
4765580	4766820	that's just keeping us all separate.
4766820	4769220	And that's all allowing us to be taken advantage of.
4769220	4774060	It's it's it's through unity and through through quality and through diversity
4774060	4776340	that we're that we are able to fight those things.
4776340	4779900	And then you you can be like, well, I wouldn't believe those things
4779900	4781580	about that person, you know, you know.
4781580	4783860	And maybe the best way to prove ourselves, if there was,
4783860	4786660	if you could call it a battle between those two sides.
4787660	4791620	The the best way to to prove to prepare for that battle
4791620	4794580	is for the individual to
4796900	4803100	have a function kind of like I'm not I'm probably not going to judge
4803100	4810300	this person like so much like like like if we if we don't get caught up
4810300	4814820	in the timber chopped down this tree, I heard that this thing is happening.
4815020	4817020	So off with their head.
4817020	4819260	Oh, yeah, no, I hate that.
4819260	4825020	I've never been in the business of throwing people away or calling people monsters.
4825020	4827980	I think that's one of that's another tool to separate people.
4827980	4831860	We're all capable of horrible choices and horrible decisions.
4832180	4836540	And you have to have and I'm not saying that you you excuse someone's actions
4836540	4841580	or excuse what they've done, but to act as if you're better
4841580	4843300	or you're right to grab that ticket.
4843300	4849260	Isn't that kind of like not to over I'm doing a writer habit here.
4849260	4851500	I'm trying to connect it to the beginning.
4851500	4853980	That guy in that park, when you're having your epiphany,
4854020	4856580	who's being abusive to his charges,
4857500	4861300	who's going like you fucking people, I'm like that guy
4862260	4865260	felt licensed to be abusive to
4866500	4871740	his mental health flock because he felt like,
4871780	4874420	oh, I'm I've got the high ground here.
4874820	4878860	Yeah. And we're going to continue to be tempted in that direction.
4878900	4884180	Like we're always going to be told as primates by Twitter, by Newsweek,
4884180	4886420	by this ringing thing in our pocket.
4886420	4889300	We're going to constantly being told, hey, there's somebody out there
4889300	4892140	that's worse than you that you could punch down on right now
4892140	4895420	if you take this opportunity or that there's someone out there
4895420	4900060	trying to take what you have or trying to stop you from getting your goals.
4900060	4905620	And at the end of the day, like you meet so many people that you're like.
4906860	4908020	We all have the same goals.
4908020	4909540	We all just kind of want the same shit.
4909540	4910180	No matter what.
4910180	4912940	We all just want to be happier and make a little bit more money
4912940	4917420	and have more time with our fucking family and do vacations and shit and work less.
4917460	4919140	We all just want to pool.
4919140	4922700	Yeah. I want maybe one more bedroom. Yeah.
4923380	4924620	I love one more bedroom.
4924620	4927860	One bedroom. We get DJ equipment that I won't use.
4928860	4933060	There should be a political party where the chant is one more bedroom.
4933100	4937300	Yeah. Like if you have a one bedroom apartment, don't you want one more bedroom?
4937340	4939860	Yes, you do.
4939860	4943700	If you have a six bedroom mansion, don't wouldn't you like to have seven bedrooms?
4943900	4945220	Yeah, I'm sure you would.
4945220	4947140	Yeah, if I want a little bit more.
4948980	4950260	What time is it?
4950260	4952820	What makes me a good host?
4952820	4954540	It's nine thirty. It was sharp.
4954540	4955620	Yes.
4955620	4957620	Blow me off. That was a blow off.
4957620	4958620	It's not a blow off.
4958620	4960380	I'm doing what you asked.
4963220	4965940	Shrab Scud, twenty five years anniversary.
4967260	4969140	Thank you very much.
4969140	4973460	I've one of my pet peeves is when somebody's
4973780	4976260	Instagram feed is a thousand things over and over,
4976260	4980420	but I've been really enjoying all of the fan art that that the people have done
4980420	4981940	for your it's pretty amazing.
4981940	4982820	It's fucking great.
4982820	4985820	And somebody did the ketchup and mustard one with the somebody.
4985860	4987100	It's Joey Garfield.

4988860	4990900	Do that from the first.
4990900	4994220	Ron, I did a comic book with Dan
4995060	4998340	like back in 1994.
4998340	5002060	And it was the reason why we moved out here.
5002060	5006020	And it just turned twenty five last last Tuesday.
5006100	5007500	It's the only comic book.
5007500	5009460	It's the only comic book that I've ever actually read.
5009460	5012100	I'm not a comic book guy, but I love Scott.
5012140	5014860	You've given me the omnibus and the whole thing.
5014860	5016740	And it's beautifully drawn.
5016740	5019740	It's it's it's it's it's really wonderful.
5019740	5020660	It's it's very you.
5020660	5022380	It's it's what was it called?
5022380	5024340	It's called Scott, the disposable assassin.
5024340	5026500	Oh, and then they made a video game.
5026500	5028820	They did. Yeah, I played the game.
5028820	5030060	It was not a good game.
5030060	5031700	No, it was not.
5031700	5032980	No, it was a terrible thing.
5032980	5033620	A Saturn.
5033620	5035220	Yeah, it's like a Saturn guy.
5035220	5036860	I want to have a Sega Saturn.
5036860	5038780	You got to play whatever is out.
5038780	5040140	Yeah, there's not much.
5040140	5042420	It's not going to USA in virtual fire.
5042420	5043340	There were two games.
5043340	5046140	There was there was the game you played
5046140	5047700	and there was a PC version.
5047700	5050260	Both were terrible.
5050260	5051780	But it's cool.
5051780	5053500	We have a cool to have a game made.
5053500	5056980	Yeah, this guy was like a side scroller.
5056980	5058700	It was a side scrolling game.
5058700	5063340	Like when Doom and Duke Nukem was hitting the scene.
5063340	5065980	It was it was like, yeah, bad timing.
5066780	5069220	But no, it's it was.
5069220	5072020	It's very cool to watch all the like all the fans
5072020	5073660	do their version of the artwork.
5073660	5076740	And it's because it's really like it kind of chucked me up.
5076740	5078260	But it's very. Yeah, yeah.
5078260	5080980	Well, I got to say, you know, not to play the bad guy,
5080980	5084940	but Scott, Scott, the disposable assassin is like,
5084940	5088420	it takes place in a future where you can buy a robot assassin
5088420	5091660	out of a vending machine and you can assign it a target.
5091660	5093540	And then once it finishes killing the target,
5093540	5096460	it self destructs kind of a rip off of Mr.
5096460	5098180	Meeseeks. Yeah, yeah.
5099140	5102180	Oh, shit.
5102180	5103140	You shots fired.
5103140	5104700	You fucking stole scud.
5104700	5106740	It wasn't my idea.
5106740	5108180	Who's was it? No, it was mine.
5108180	5110620	Just a Justin Justin.
5110620	5113300	Wait, wait, was it was Justin
5113300	5115140	consciously or unconsciously?
5115140	5117420	I know nobody. Nobody recognized it.
5117420	5119620	That's like I think later on, it was like, oh, shit.
5119620	5122220	We kind of rip off a little bit like like
5123860	5125060	a fair amount of fans.
5125060	5127860	So you saw them making the action figure money.
5128100	5132700	Scott and the opening up a book, Scott kills his target
5132700	5135100	and then is washing off his hands in the bathroom
5135100	5138420	and sees his reflection in the mirror and reads the warning
5138420	5141620	on the back that says, well, this unit will self destruct
5141620	5142580	upon termination.
5142580	5145900	So he goes out and has to kill everybody as a as a
5146860	5151140	like a hit man for hire to keep his first target alive.
5151140	5152340	Like a life support system.
5152340	5154660	Yeah, to pay for the hospital bills.
5154660	5157300	So is it Jeff? Is this a character who's Jeff?
5157300	5159660	Jeff is the demon monster named after your brother.
5159660	5162540	Not me. No. Yeah.
5162540	5165820	Yeah. And so he all the episodes of him going out
5165820	5169660	and being a gun for hire to keep the life support
5169660	5171940	going on the first person so he doesn't die.
5171940	5174260	And he falls in love with Suu Sudeo.
5174260	5177100	Yes. Who looks exactly like Kate, your wife.
5177100	5179900	Oh, yeah. Nice.

5206020	5208740	Like whether it's a fishing podcast or like,

5977160	5981960	I mean, look, as we, we here in Harman town accept the possibility that that
5981960	5985640	wasn't all four cylinders.
5985640	5990200	If having seen it, you want another, you want one more?
5993440	5995520	I know I would, but I haven't eaten yet.
5997800	6001880	Uh, what time is it? How do you end a show? I never know how.
6001880	6005040	I think we just did. Well, that was a pretty good closer.
6007400	6010120	Uh, giggle fit. Just Google it.
6010120	6011120	Google it.
6011120	6012880	Google everything. Funches related.
6012880	6016800	Yeah. Just give me a Google and then support me financially.
6021440	6025680	Follow, follow Instagram, Ron Funches. And, uh, like, wait,
6025680	6029120	how did they find your podcast? Is that getting better podcasts? Yeah.
6029680	6033440	Google getting better with Ron. Ron Funches is like my favorite thing that I'm
6033440	6037600	doing. I like it a lot. People seem to be getting stuff out of it. It's fun.
6037840	6041680	That's fantastic. Come by. No, no, no. I won't accept that invitation. Okay.
6043720	6047520	I'll come by over my own dead body. Um, but I know I do. I mean,
6047520	6050400	I just liked the idea. I liked that. I liked that theme song.
6050400	6053720	I liked the idea of talking to people. That's me. I sing it. Yeah. Yeah.
6054200	6059240	I didn't think I didn't think it was professional, but that's me.
6061040	6064480	Ron, like a couple of times I've been on the road, uh, doing my gigs and, uh,
6064600	6068840	w you had been at the theater before us, like the Wilbur in Boston or whatever.
6069240	6073320	And everybody that is like, I always ask when I, when I go to a theater,
6073400	6076760	so who was cool that was here recently. And your name comes up a lot.
6076760	6080240	And people always love the fact that you were in the building and the,
6080240	6080760	like the,
6080760	6084680	everybody is always happy that like you left joy in your wake. So that's,
6084680	6085680	that's a cool thing.
6089800	6092920	It's a thing to aspire to. If you're under 35,
6094720	6097040	and you've left nothing but scorched earth in your wake,
6098840	6100160	everybody think we're coming to her.
6103680	6104520	Rob Schwab.
