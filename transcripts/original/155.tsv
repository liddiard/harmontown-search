0	19400	Welcome, when it all, to San Diego, California Comic Con!
19400	23280	At the Tin Roast, I've never been to Tin Roast, this place is all right.
23280	29680	We're packed from floor to rafters here, let's start off by welcoming the Game Master to the
29680	59680	stars, Mr. Spencer Crittenden, and of course, the mayor of Harman
59680	68160	Hi, hello, hi everyone, don't be alarmed.
68160	74720	There's been a slight security breach, but we want everyone to have a very good time.
74720	81240	There's been a vulnerability in the paddock, in several paddocks, all the paddocks are very
81240	82240	vulnerable.
82240	94680	But if you could please just calm down, I'm slightly, there are rafters, but it's fine,
94680	101520	just don't move, they can't see you if you don't move.
101520	102920	I thought that was T-Rex.
102920	106560	No, it's all of them.
106560	110960	Holy shit, there's lots of rafters in the paddock.
111360	112360	Are we in the paddock?
112360	114360	No, we are outside of the paddock.
114360	116360	We're not in the paddock.
116360	120360	And it looks like they're coming towards us.
127360	133360	All right, just calm down, just please, rafters, if you will just...
133360	138360	Spencer, stay perfectly still, the visual acuity is based on movement.
139360	142360	Oh, thank God, he's here.
142360	147360	Easy, easy.
147360	150360	Chris Pratt, is that you?
150360	154360	Alpha Daisy, Beta, Beta Margaret.
154360	158360	I only saw the movie once, but easy.
158360	163360	They don't like to be talked to that way.
163360	167360	The mic cord is wrapped around.
168360	172360	The mic cord's visual acuity is based on movement.
172360	175360	Easy, rafters, easy.
175360	178360	They're good dinosaurs.
178360	179360	Thank you.
179360	183360	I know, Jeff, I know you're very passionate about them being used as weapons.
183360	188360	I feel like they must be, because we're fighting a global war on terror.
188360	194360	As long as you maintain that stance from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end,
194360	198360	with no arc, no perceivable arc whatsoever.
198360	201360	But maybe I just, I'm in three scenes and I just say that three times.
201360	204360	I guess, but that's the middle scene, you should be like,
204360	209360	hmm, maybe they should make Sundays, I don't know.
209360	212360	But I'm not here to talk about story structure.
212360	218360	Go on, go on, rafters, back to your paddock.
218360	224360	Please.
224360	229360	That was just as disorganized as that first date we went on.
229360	232360	Wait, I have a question.
232360	236360	Is this, somebody's aunt, right?
236360	239360	Yes, yes, the most sustainable aunt.
239360	243360	Yes, I'm an aunt and it is the most important relationship you can ever have.
243360	246360	Everyone wants to spend time with their aunt, yes.
246360	249360	But listen, why wasn't the mother in that movie?
249360	251360	Why are the aunts in that?
251360	256360	Because she had to be hot and it would have been weird if it was their mom.
256360	259360	Listen, I'm sorry we went on a date.
259360	262360	Just thanks for not wearing shorts tonight.
262360	265360	I don't know why you did whatever you did.
265360	268360	You had an itinerary or that's our back story.
268360	271360	It was very organized and very career driven.
271360	275360	Does it make any sense that we had a back story at all?
275360	277360	Why did we go on that date?
277360	279360	Isn't that on both of us?
279360	282360	Like if we went on a date, why would we see each other and go on a date
282360	284360	and why would we be mad that it didn't work out?
284360	286360	Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
286360	288360	That's what dates are supposed to do.
288360	292360	You should get mad if you marry someone on accident.
292360	296360	You shouldn't be mad if you go on a date and someone wears cargo shorts.
296360	299360	Right, or is too organized.
299360	302360	It would make more sense if maybe we had a one night stand,
302360	304360	but it looks like we just got sandwiches.
304360	306360	We just got sandwiches and then didn't get along,
306360	308360	and now we hate each other for some reason.
308360	314360	But nothing gets everybody hard and wet like hunting dinosaurs.
314360	318360	You know, dinosaurs just want to do this and then that and then that.
318360	322360	You got to know what one of those is.
322360	325360	This is very disorganized for my taste.
325360	329360	Dan, can we talk a little bit about your weapon?
329360	331360	Show me this rifle you have.
331360	338360	I'm afraid to take it off now that I know that police can mistake a towel for a gun.
338360	342360	It has the orange tip on it. I don't think you're going to get shot.
342360	344360	A towel, Jeff.
344360	349360	A towel has no trigger or handle or sights on it.
349360	355360	Let's have a hand for my wife, Harry McGathey.
355360	358360	It was me the whole time.
358360	361360	Back to your paddock. Back to your paddock.
361360	363360	She's going back to her paddock.
363360	365360	Wow. Oh.
365360	370360	In heels. She's going to run 45 miles an hour to her paddock.
370360	372360	In high heels.
372360	375360	Also, you have a knife in the back too?
375360	377360	You got a little weapon behind you?
377360	384360	This isn't a knife. This is a knife.
384360	386360	Don't put it by me. I'm going to get shot.
386360	388360	You asked me to take it off.
388360	394360	Hey, San Diego. Welcome to the Comic Con.
394360	398360	I'm getting out of this shit right away. I'm getting very sweaty.
398360	404360	I'm 42, and there's only a certain amount of time I have before my temperature becomes so unregulated
404360	407360	that I just fall forward and crush nine people.
407360	411360	Who would ironically be dressed as Transformers?
411360	413360	Glad to thank you guys for staying.
413360	417360	I think we were worried that we wouldn't be able to fill a venue.
417360	419360	Sunday night is usually when people go back.
419360	421360	How many of you guys are from San Diego?
421360	424360	Oh. There's the key.
424360	427360	We got a lot of San Diego fans. That's the key.
427360	431360	I figured we'd be reliant on out-of-towners.
431360	434360	Fuck those people.
434360	437360	Fuck these people. Thank God they're gone.
437360	440360	Fucking nerds dressed as shit.
440360	444360	Look at that banana asshole. Fuck you, banana.
444360	451360	This guy comes here every year. He's from San Jose. He's a piece of shit.
451360	455360	It's that guy and all the poison ivies. Fuck him.
455360	457360	A lot of poison ivies everywhere.
457360	459360	I'm all for it.
459360	462360	The city chokes on poison ivies every year.
462360	469360	I just flew in from Las Vegas and from the car door to the hotel front door,
469360	472360	I saw nine Lara Crofts.
472360	474360	Really?
474360	477360	I saw all the Tomb Raiders. Raiden Tombs.
477360	479360	Some of the more interesting stuff I saw.
479360	483360	I saw Steampunk Star Wars guys.
483360	486360	Okay. Cricket.
486360	488360	I just thought that was a neat...
488360	497360	I get cosplay this year because I think I'm getting my Comic-Con post-Harmon Town Comic-Con vibe down.
497360	499360	I really like coming here.
499360	508360	One of the things I like about it is Comic-Con is a time when I can walk down a really crowded city street.
508360	513360	Just every ten minutes, someone goes, Dan Harmon!
513360	518360	It's perfectly timed every time because it's just as my self-esteem has started to crash.
518360	520360	Ten more minutes.
520360	523360	It's never a problem.
523360	530360	I just realized if you're dressed as a banana or a stormtrooper or Mario or something,
530360	534360	because I see people, they say to each other, they go, Deadpool!
534360	535360	Hey, Deadpool!
535360	537360	Then the Deadpool comes over and they get a picture with them.
537360	539360	I'm like, this is what we all come here for.
539360	541360	It's an opportunity to craft.
541360	546360	It's just a high you get at people telling you that everyone should experience that.
546360	553360	If we lived in a tribe of 100 people, probably one one-hundredth of your day would be filled with people going,
553360	555360	Hey, Kevin! Tasha!
555360	558360	I need a shoe. I need a roof on my cottage.
558360	562360	And biologically we're designed for that. Emotionally we're designed for that.
562360	569360	Nobody makes roofs like Tasha.
569360	574360	I mean, I'm a feminist. I believe that's true.
574360	580360	Thanks, ladies.
580360	586360	The thanks, ladies face of feminism may be over, but I'm 42.
586360	590360	I think that's where I peak out. Thanks, ladies.
590360	595360	Hey, ladies, by applause, who's a feminist?
595360	600360	Ladies' night for feminism.
600360	607360	Wear your feminist bracelet and you can have blowjob shots for free.
607360	614360	Okay, so let's go on our lightning round hilarious observations from Dan segment.
614360	620360	Okay, let's do this shit.
620360	624360	Yo, yo, yo, these are little things I put in my Evernote.
624360	629360	I just wanted to say them and that's why I wrote them down.
629360	640360	Don't turn your frown upside down because it's time for observations.
640360	645360	Okay, so you know when you're in any building ever in a hotel or anything?
645360	650360	And every once in a while, the three-prong electrical outlet is upside down.
650360	655360	The little hole, the little third hole is on top. It's on the bottom.
655360	662360	Is that a guy who did it wrong or is that like the Jackson Pollock of electricians?
662360	666360	Is he like, fuck, this is my fucking flourish.
666360	673360	They're pointing at one guy. This is apparently the guy that does it.
673360	677360	Certified electrician, get up here.
677360	683360	It's a new segment. It's called ask a certified electrician.
683360	685360	We don't have a structure to this show.
685360	689360	You thought this was going to be, you thought there was going to be a Seinfeld bit.
689360	693360	If Seinfeld was doing this show, he would have been like, fuck it.
693360	694360	Grab a mic.
694360	697360	Oh yeah, can you, what's your name, sir?
697360	701360	Logan, take the mic out of the stand and hold it like a human being.
701360	703360	You're an electrician.
703360	704360	He's not a roadie.
704360	708360	I'm also a union electrician, local 569 in San Diego.
708360	710360	Yeah.
710360	714360	And we all know the Death Star was non-union labor.
714360	715360	Oh.
715360	717360	Wait, what's that, the Death Star is non-union labor?
717360	719360	That's a Kevin Smith reference.
719360	721360	I guess, right?
721360	722360	I don't know.
722360	723360	Who knows?
723360	725360	He's okay with the guy.
725360	727360	Yes, that was the Kevin Smith joke.
727360	728360	All right.
728360	732360	So upside down, upside down, three prong outlets.
732360	733360	Why?
733360	736360	The other two, one's a hot, one's a neutral.
736360	743360	And if those are actually the other way and you happen to drop your metal piece of something
743360	747360	and it hit those and you're connected to it, you would hurt yourself.
747360	749360	That's why if it's the other way...
749360	753360	So you're a union electrician, but you call it a metal piece of something?
754360	761360	Let's say you're a metal apron, your metal piece of clothing or some sort of metal thing
761360	763360	that happened to hit it or something you're reading.
763360	764360	I don't know.
764360	765360	But I would hit it.
765360	767360	So that's why when it actually does hit it, you get hurt.
767360	773360	So if it's the ground, which is the little point, hits it first because it slides behind
773360	776360	the bed or the table, you're safer because it hits the ground.
776360	782360	And if it hits the neutral and the hot, boom, it makes contact, not the way it should be.
782360	783360	And then you'll hurt yourself.
783360	786360	Is my brain moving slower?
786360	791360	You're saying that makes the difference between upside down or right side up?
791360	792360	Yes.
792360	797360	So when you see a face that is upside down, where it's just the mouth on top and then
797360	798360	two eyeballs.
798360	799360	That's the mouth on top.
799360	800360	Now you're talking my language.
800360	803360	Mouth on top, yeah.
803360	808360	When Mr. Bill is upside down, Mr. Bill is upside down.
808360	811360	So yeah, the first thing it would hit if it was upside down would be the ground.
811360	815360	When you say the first thing it would hit, you mean if you're working on the wiring
815360	816360	behind the...
816360	817360	No, anything.
817360	820360	Anything that might hit it like an article of metal or something...
820360	822360	Or like a thumbtack in the wall.
822360	824360	How did you hit a hole?
824360	825360	I don't know.
825360	826360	What do you mean?
826360	829360	Let's say you're just having a wild dance party.
829360	834360	So like your plug is hanging out of the wall such that some of the metal is visible, right?
834360	837360	And a thumbtack falls off the wall and topples into that crevice.
837360	839360	Oh, if it's not all the way plugged in.
839360	840360	Yes.
840360	841360	Brilliant.
841360	842360	Okay.
842360	847360	Okay, so upside down is the fucking actual Zorro way to do it.
847360	850360	It is the code way because it's the safest way.
850360	852360	All the right side up plug...
852360	854360	And all union electricians know that.
854360	855360	Oh my God.
855360	856360	Thank you, electrician.
856360	859360	He's a leading electrician.
859360	865360	Put him upside down, you pieces of shit.
865360	867360	What was his name?
867360	868360	What was your name?
868360	869360	Logan.
869360	876360	Fake name, fake name.
876360	878360	All right.
878360	879360	So, okay.
879360	880360	More random...
880360	885360	We've already gotten more shit done in a haunted town than we ever have.
885360	886360	It's San Diego.
886360	887360	It's a port town.
887360	890360	In LA, you're just playing to a crowd of people that are like,
890360	893360	I hope Spielberg orders lunch soon.
893360	896360	Or I might have a job.
896360	900360	Some of these people's parents haul fish, Jeff.
900360	901360	All right.
901360	904360	They skin dolphins here.
904360	907360	This is a labor town.
907360	911360	I got to get that orca into his paddock.
911360	913360	Or my children won't eat.
913360	915360	All right, so there's electricians here.
915360	917360	We get them from San Diego.
917360	919360	Movie skeletons.
919360	923360	I asked my chiropractor.
923360	925360	He said, is your back feel better?
925360	927360	I said, I guess.
927360	929360	And then I was leaving and he goes like,
929360	931360	hey, any more questions you have for me?
931360	932360	And I said, yes.
932360	935360	In the movies, when you find a skeleton,
935360	940360	they wouldn't stay together, would they?
940360	945360	Like when you find a pirate and he's like holding a fucking sack of gold
945360	949360	and he's got a hat on and a trench coat, like that's not real.
949360	951360	And he's like, well, they're held together by ligaments.
951360	952360	And I'm like, and they would.
952360	953360	And he's like, they would rot.
953360	957360	And I'm like, so Goonies is a piece of shit.
957360	962360	You can't have fucking skeletons in the midst of like steering a ship.
962360	963360	That shit wouldn't happen.
963360	964360	Wait.
964360	967360	So you're not you don't have a problem with a skeleton being alive,
967360	969360	just that it's together.
969360	972360	Well, I'm assuming if you're allowing for magic,
972360	974360	then you're allowing that they could just be like,
974360	977360	I don't know if brooms can fight Mickey Mouse,
977360	979360	then a skeleton can hang out, I guess.
979360	982360	But but when you find a skeleton and it's like,
982360	985360	on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, when you're in line,
985360	987360	there's that pirate that's like leaning up against a wall
987360	989360	with a sword through his chest.
989360	990360	He would just be a pilot.
990360	991360	Yeah.
991360	993360	It's not like hero Hiroshima, where it's like,
993360	1001360	oh, there was a kid throwing a ball in the air or like too soon.
1001360	1002360	They're not saying boo.
1002360	1005360	They're saying Goonies.
1005360	1006360	Or or okay.
1006360	1007360	Okay, guys.
1007360	1008360	Pompeii.
1008360	1010360	Is that cool enough?
1010360	1011360	All right.
1011360	1014360	You guys over Pompeii?
1014360	1018360	When it's like this was a rich man getting held up by a beggar
1018360	1019360	like, you know, everybody's here.
1019360	1020360	It's like that.
1020360	1021360	Okay.
1021360	1022360	I guess the ash fell that fast.
1022360	1026360	But if you unless you if you laid down and we're like,
1026360	1027360	I'm going to die.
1027360	1030360	I'm going to be a skeleton when they find me.
1030360	1031360	I'm going to lay down.
1031360	1034360	You'd have to lay all the way down and then just like make sure
1034360	1035360	there was no air in the room.
1035360	1038360	And like you slowly rot like 6000 years later,
1038360	1039360	you'd be a skeleton.
1039360	1042360	But the minute somebody was like, look, it's a skeleton.
1042360	1045360	If they touched your arm, you can like lift you up like a puppet.
1045360	1048360	Your arm would make all of it would fall down like a house of cards.
1048360	1049360	All right.
1049360	1050360	All right.
1050360	1052360	So I'm glad I could get so much done.
1052360	1053360	Yeah.
1053360	1054360	Okay.
1054360	1055360	All right.
1055360	1056360	Screenwriters.
1056360	1060360	I know there's 90 of you in the room right now because because
1060360	1062360	the software does the formatting work.
1062360	1067360	So now everyone's a fucking screenwriter.
1067360	1071360	I'm going to take a page out of your script.
1071360	1075360	Uh, everything happens suddenly.
1075360	1078360	Dumb fucks.
1078360	1079360	Stop telling.
1079360	1081360	Everything happens suddenly.
1081360	1086360	If a car explodes gradually, let me know.
1086360	1089360	Otherwise, I imagine it suddenly.
1089360	1091360	I know it's a car explodes.
1091360	1092360	You're done.
1092360	1094360	Move on.
1094360	1096360	Save a word.
1096360	1098360	Frasier.
1098360	1102360	I'm not going to picture the car slowly turning orange and then blossoming
1102360	1105360	into a dismantled car over the period of six months.
1105360	1109360	Have you never said suddenly in a script even in the early days?
1109360	1113360	When I was dumb and then I grew.
1113360	1114360	That's why I'm angry.
1114360	1117360	It's called bullying.
1117360	1119360	Okay.
1119360	1120360	Metacabs.
1120360	1121360	Hey.
1121360	1126360	Could we have a more uncomfortable on the nose manifestation of the class
1126360	1127360	system?
1127360	1128360	Okay.
1128360	1129360	I can't fucking.
1129360	1130360	I'm so lazy.
1130360	1131360	I can't do it.
1131360	1132360	I got to keep using them.
1132360	1133360	And I'm just sitting back there.
1133360	1136360	Could you feel more ancient and more Roman than when you were writing
1136360	1137360	over these things?
1137360	1140360	And there's just a guy.
1140360	1141360	Okay.
1141360	1143360	All right.
1143360	1144360	Uh, okay.
1144360	1145360	One more.
1145360	1146360	No.
1146360	1148360	A 10 more.
1148360	1149360	Okay.
1149360	1151360	This has been, this has been a long time coming.
1151360	1152360	I saved it for tonight.
1152360	1156360	Why would you have a favorite color?
1156360	1159360	What does that mean?
1159360	1160360	Stupid.
1160360	1161360	Stupid.
1161360	1163360	Why would you have a favorite color?
1163360	1165360	That doesn't mean anything.
1165360	1168360	Does that mean you want everything to be that color?
1168360	1171360	Then you're using color wrong.
1171360	1174360	That's like having a favorite musical note.
1174360	1175360	Or.
1175360	1177360	Hat, hat, hat, hat, hat.
1177360	1178360	You wouldn't be a musician.
1178360	1180360	You'd design car alarms.
1180360	1183360	Or people say, what's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
1183360	1185360	I said, no, I like ice cream.
1185360	1186360	I'll fucking.
1186360	1188360	Motherfucker put a hot dog in it on Monday.
1188360	1190360	And then put some pretzels in it on Tuesday.
1190360	1192360	I don't want a hot dog in my ice cream.
1192360	1193360	Yeah, you do.
1193360	1194360	No.
1194360	1196360	We're going to prove it by the end of the night.
1196360	1197360	You don't like ice cream.
1197360	1199360	We just found that out.
1199360	1201360	You got to put a hot dog in on a Monday?
1201360	1202360	I like it.
1202360	1203360	Hiroshima.
1204360	1207360	We did Hiroshima, though, right?
1207360	1209360	Yeah, that was our fault.
1209360	1210360	That's like a...
1210360	1213360	I can't come up with a non-offensive example.
1213360	1215360	So I won't.
1218360	1219360	You're welcome.
1219360	1221360	Spencer, all right.
1221360	1222360	You're Harry Truman.
1222360	1224360	You're the newly-elected president.
1224360	1226360	It's the end of World War II.
1226360	1229360	Do you drop the atomic bomb, the newly-created atomic bomb,
1229360	1231360	to end the war and save life?
1231360	1232360	So do you not do it?
1232360	1234360	Make your answer thoughtful enough that I can make a drink.
1234360	1235360	Okay.
1235360	1240360	So, I mean, what did Harry Truman do besides that?
1240360	1241360	Anything?
1241360	1242360	Not a whole lot.
1242360	1244360	He wasn't in office very long, I don't think.
1244360	1245360	Well...
1245360	1246360	The Warsaw Pact.
1246360	1247360	See what?
1247360	1248360	The Warsaw Pact.
1248360	1249360	Warsaw Pact.
1249360	1250360	Thank you, sir.
1250360	1251360	The Warsaw Pact.
1251360	1252360	Did he beat Dewey?
1252360	1253360	He did beat Dewey.
1253360	1258360	But not according to one newspaper.
1259360	1264360	So this is coming off the heels of the Warsaw Pact.
1264360	1265360	Yeah.
1265360	1266360	He's riding high on that.
1266360	1267360	Yeah.
1267360	1269360	He's got that Warsaw Pact cachet.
1269360	1270360	All right.
1271360	1272360	Dan's good.
1272360	1276360	Now, your secretary of defense and war and all those people come in and say,
1276360	1279360	all right, Mr. President, we have this new weapon.
1279360	1282360	We're going to drop it, or we won't.
1282360	1286360	Do we do it to save American lives and kill a zillion people instantly,
1286360	1288360	or do we not do that morality-wise?
1288360	1292360	Do we do it to scare off the Nazis and the rest of the world,
1292360	1296360	the Soviets who are our current allies, maybe our next enemy?
1296360	1297360	What do you do?
1297360	1300360	You're President Spencer Crittenden.
1300360	1306360	Drop the fucking hammer!
1306360	1310360	But you know that was not about protecting ourselves from the Japanese.
1310360	1312360	Like, we had won that war.
1312360	1314360	Like, that was about an excuse.
1314360	1318360	It was about making them surrender when they were going to lose.
1318360	1320360	No, it was about revealing.
1320360	1321360	Let's bring Logan back up.
1321360	1322360	Logan, get back up here.
1322360	1324360	I'm kidding, of course.
1324360	1327360	It was obviously about revealing in our game of Hearthstone
1327360	1330360	that we had the fucking mushroom cloud card.
1330360	1331360	Yeah.
1331360	1334360	Most actions have multiple reasons, sure.
1334360	1335360	But that was the reason.
1335360	1337360	The Japanese were defeated.
1337360	1338360	Yeah, but they weren't giving up.
1338360	1339360	That was the thing.
1339360	1341360	They were defeated, but they weren't giving up.
1341360	1345360	And they needed, check it out, two of your cities are gone.
1345360	1346360	Fucking give up.
1346360	1349360	But we were showing that to the world.
1349360	1350360	Yeah, both of us are right.
1350360	1351360	How about that?
1351360	1352360	Yeah, we're both right.
1352360	1353360	Okay.
1353360	1357360	I mean, talk about, the real quandary is Nagasaki.
1357360	1359360	Like, why the second one?
1359360	1361360	The answer in our history books, when we were kids...
1361360	1364360	You mean, down in Nagasaki, where the men are Chew Chew Becky
1364360	1366360	and the women are Mickey Wacky Will?
1366360	1369360	Too soon.
1369360	1371360	Nagasaki, we dropped the bomb right away on them.
1371360	1375360	And that was in history, what we learned in American grade schools
1375360	1377360	is the reason we did that is because...
1377360	1380360	And this sounds, this could either be true or not true,
1380360	1382360	but it just sounds so sixth grade.
1382360	1384360	Like, we had to drop the bomb on Nagasaki
1384360	1386360	because otherwise they would have thought
1386360	1390360	we only were able to make one.
1390360	1392360	That's the only reason that I know of.
1392360	1394360	That's the only reason that I learned.
1394360	1398360	I mean, those pilots have written memoirs and books and shit.
1398360	1402360	There might be some crazy drama surrounding the second bomb man.
1402360	1404360	The second one, it missed.
1404360	1405360	It flew over a hill.
1405360	1408360	It didn't take out as much as the town as they hoped it would.
1408360	1409360	Yeah.
1409360	1412360	Yeah, they wanted to bomb somewhere else, right?
1412360	1414360	Yeah, but the weather was bad that day, right?
1414360	1415360	Yeah.
1415360	1419360	The weather was bad for bombing.
1419360	1421360	That's my main problem with Japan.
1421360	1423360	It's usually terrible bombing work.
1424360	1427360	Speaking of military strategy,
1427360	1429360	this was a historic comic-con.
1429360	1431360	They had drones down on the deck
1431360	1434360	that were shaped like the Doctor Who TARDIS,
1434360	1436360	and they were flying them up in the air,
1436360	1439360	and the fucking Air Force came in and shut it down.
1439360	1441360	What?
1441360	1443360	That's what I heard. I wasn't there.
1443360	1444360	Were they jealous?
1444360	1445360	They're like, are you jealous?
1445360	1449360	Make a rectangle, hexagonal...
1449360	1450360	I think we're just so close to...
1450360	1452360	I mean, this is a military base.
1452360	1453360	San Diego is a military base.
1453360	1457360	There's an enormous aircraft carrier out in the harbor right now.
1457360	1458360	There's a couple.
1458360	1460360	Logan, what's the name of the aircraft carrier?
1460360	1461360	Midway.
1461360	1462360	That wasn't Logan, but thank you, sir.
1462360	1463360	The Vincent.
1463360	1465360	Reagan and Vincent.
1465360	1466360	I don't know any more details on that.
1466360	1468360	It's the Reagan class?
1468360	1469360	The Reagan and Vincent.
1469360	1470360	Reagan and Vincent.
1470360	1471360	Nimitz class.
1471360	1472360	Nimitz class, holy shit.
1472360	1474360	Anyways, they had to put a net around
1474360	1475360	where they were demonstrating the drones,
1475360	1478360	because now everyone can have a drone now,
1478360	1479360	and so they were like,
1479360	1481360	but you can't have a drone.
1481360	1483360	You could wage war on America now
1483360	1485360	with your Doctor Who TARDIS.
1485360	1488360	They got nervous.
1488360	1491360	They know shit we don't about drone warfare then,
1491360	1493360	because I don't think anyone out there was thinking,
1493360	1495360	boy, if we put a bomb on this,
1495360	1497360	if we put an ISIS guy on there,
1497360	1499360	and they were thinking that.
1499360	1501360	They're like, if there was an ISIS guy on there...
1501360	1503360	If you put a guy on the drone,
1503360	1504360	it's not a drone anymore.
1504360	1505360	It's just a plane.
1505360	1511360	Not if he's not flying it though, right?
1511360	1512360	Say what?
1512360	1513360	Not if he's not flying it.
1513360	1514360	Yeah, what if he's like the bomb?
1514360	1515360	Is it still a drone if he's just hanging out?
1515360	1516360	He's just laying back?
1516360	1517360	Yeah.
1517360	1518360	Play Minecraft.
1518360	1519360	If he's taking a nap at the drone,
1519360	1521360	and he's on a drone.
1521360	1524360	I've seen Minecraft drones that look like ghasts.
1524360	1526360	No one gets it.
1526360	1528360	We all get it.
1528360	1530360	I mean, it's not a joke really, so.
1530360	1532360	Right reaction.
1532360	1533360	Okay.
1534360	1535360	Also right reaction.
1535360	1539360	I want to know more about this guy wearing the banana outfit.
1539360	1541360	I don't know if we do.
1541360	1542360	We don't want to know.
1542360	1544360	He's dressed like a banana, I mean.
1544360	1547360	No, he just pointed at himself like me.
1554360	1555360	Oh, okay.
1555360	1556360	Okay, fuck it.
1556360	1557360	Get out here.
1557360	1558360	Banana guy.
1558360	1559360	Banana...
1559360	1561360	Gentlemen, what's your name?
1561360	1562360	Fixer.
1563360	1564360	I should have known.
1564360	1565360	Check that mic, banana guy.
1565360	1566360	What's your name?
1566360	1567360	Victor.
1567360	1568360	Victor.
1568360	1569360	Why a banana?
1569360	1570360	Why not?
1570360	1571360	Yeah, fuck it up.
1571360	1572360	All right.
1572360	1573360	San Diego!
1573360	1574360	All right.
1574360	1577360	Victor, what is your greatest fear in life?
1577360	1579360	What's the motivating fear in your life?
1579360	1582360	When you wake up and you have a bad dream?
1582360	1585360	What's the thing that is like the most terrifying possibility
1585360	1588360	for a gentleman that wears a banana outfit?
1588360	1591360	Well, I'm in character right now, so someone eating me.
1591360	1592360	No, no, no, but for real.
1592360	1593360	Just Victor.
1593360	1594360	Not banana guy.
1594360	1595360	Victor.
1597360	1599360	Not knowing what to say?
1601360	1602360	Really?
1602360	1603360	Yes.
1603360	1606360	Well, what's the worst that could happen if he didn't know what to say?
1606360	1608360	People stare at me.
1608360	1609360	So as a...
1609360	1613360	But now we tie it back into you dressing like a banana.
1614360	1617360	Because your biggest indirect fear is people staring at you.
1617360	1619360	No, but I get it because then when you...
1619360	1621360	When you dress like a banana, people will stare at you
1621360	1623360	and you don't have to say anything.
1623360	1624360	You've said it all.
1624360	1625360	I'm a banana.
1627360	1629360	Barack Obama doesn't dress like a banana.
1629360	1631360	He becomes president.
1631360	1633360	You're like, look at me, I'm a banana.
1633360	1635360	That goes to my thesis earlier.
1635360	1637360	People go like, hey, Deadpool, can I get a picture?
1637360	1639360	And you're like, I feel like I'm somebody.
1639360	1640360	I get that.
1640360	1641360	I get it.
1641360	1645360	My banana costume is like having a feud with Chevy Chase.
1646360	1648360	Whatever it takes to...
1648360	1650360	I get it because I get the feeling of like,
1650360	1654360	oh, I have an identity now and I don't disparage it at all.
1656360	1659360	Where are you at on the Kinsey scale, do you think?
1661360	1664360	If 100% is just totally straight as an arrow...
1664360	1666360	It's 1 to 6, right?
1666360	1668360	Oh, is it 1 to 6?
1668360	1669360	1 to 6.
1669360	1671360	1 being straightest.
1672360	1674360	What is the scale?
1674360	1677360	I think 1 is straightest and 6 is like...
1677360	1679360	Well, we could go by hypotheticals.
1679360	1682360	If another dude dressed as a banana came in
1683360	1685360	and he looked like Ewan McGregor...
1686360	1687360	Well, that's not even.
1687360	1688360	That's a...
1688360	1689360	You'd hit that.
1689360	1690360	Totally.
1691360	1693360	All right, that's a good enough answer.
1693360	1694360	That's at least a 3.
1694360	1696360	Is he really dressed like a banana?
1696360	1697360	Yeah, of course he's dressed like a banana.
1697360	1698360	They could split and get out of here.
1698360	1699360	That'd be cool.
1700360	1703360	Oh, you guys like wordplay.
1703360	1706360	There are three banana puns in the world, and that's one of them.
1706360	1708360	What's the second one?
1708360	1709360	I can't.
1709360	1711360	I'm going bananas.
1711360	1714360	You're doing it for the group appeal.
1718360	1721360	Victor of the Banana, everybody. Victor of the Banana.
1721360	1722360	Banana Man!
1726360	1727360	It's a banana.
1728360	1729360	All right.
1729360	1730360	We met a banana.
1730360	1732360	All right, question for you.
1732360	1735360	There's this movie, James Franco and Jonah Hill are in it,
1735360	1737360	and it's called True Story.
1737360	1740360	It's on all the hotel TVs right now.
1740360	1742360	I didn't really notice it in theaters.
1742360	1743360	On all the hotel TVs?
1743360	1744360	Yeah, everyone.
1744360	1748360	So it's like about a murderer that's based on the True Story
1748360	1751360	and it's called True Story, and it's a serious movie.
1752360	1756360	Do you think that Jonah Hill's agent and James Franco's agent
1756360	1758360	both separately were like,
1758360	1761360	dude, you've got to do another serious one.
1761360	1763360	You've been silly for five movies in a row.
1763360	1766360	Let's show them your money ball chops
1766360	1770360	or your guy with the arm behind a rock chops.
1771360	1774360	Do you think they both separately were like,
1774360	1776360	okay, yeah, yeah, I've got to pay some dues.
1776360	1778360	Let's show them some drama shit.
1778360	1779360	Let's get an Oscar.
1779360	1782360	And then they walked in a set and they're like, what the fuck?
1782360	1786360	When they saw each other, no one's going to take this movie seriously.
1786360	1790360	You've got to put money ball with a dramatic actor and vice versa.
1790360	1793360	They look ridiculous together and it's a terrible movie.
1793360	1795360	Okay, let's move on.
1795360	1798360	So I saw a three-legged dog walking down the streets of San Diego.
1798360	1800360	I think I saw that dog.
1800360	1802360	I love this joke.
1802360	1803360	It's not a joke.
1803360	1805360	There was a dog with three legs.
1805360	1812360	The missing leg was in the back.
1812360	1816360	And I was watching it and you can't tell when dogs.
1816360	1822360	The fact that the dog could have three legs and not show it on its face
1822360	1825360	kind of makes me panic about how well I'm taking care of my dog
1825360	1830360	because my dog always looks happy and so did this dog.
1830360	1837360	And he's one quarter down of the fundamental economy of dogmas.
1837360	1840360	He's totally fucked as a dog.
1840360	1842360	He was like, yeah, what's going on?
1842360	1844360	Anybody got some bacon?
1844360	1849360	But the thing that was really distracting me was assuming that's a male dog
1849360	1853360	because I think female dogs kind of squat so does Harvey.
1853360	1857360	Do you know this, that male dogs learn to lift a leg from each other?
1857360	1859360	It's like a learned behavior.
1859360	1866360	Male dogs, if they're left in a vacuum, they'll squat and just pee down.
1866360	1869360	Where's Harvey on the Kinsey scale?
1869360	1870360	I don't know.
1870360	1876360	But anyways, so I was like, assuming that's a male dog,
1876360	1881360	what does he do when he pees because half of his back legs are gone?
1881360	1884360	If he lifts right, he falls right over.
1884360	1889360	So then right as I said that, he's stopped by a telephone pole
1889360	1891360	and it's like the answer was right in front of me.
1891360	1895360	This dog, the one great thing about his life is there's no leg to lift.
1895360	1901360	He just stopped next to a telephone pole and shot a fucking laser to the side.
1901360	1903360	He doesn't have to do anything.
1903360	1908360	He has like fast and furious seven turrets that come out of this.
1908360	1910360	He just shoots sideways.
1910360	1914360	Anyways, okay, so it's a San Diego Comic Con podcast
1914360	1917360	and you're getting a lot of fast bits.
1917360	1920360	Okay, all right, you ever seen a commercial,
1920360	1922360	like a Mountain Dew commercial or a chip commercial
1922360	1926360	where a kid rides a bike up a ramp
1926360	1928360	and then he does a somersault on the bike
1928360	1931360	and then the whole bike and him go into the ocean?
1931360	1932360	Where does the bike go?
1932360	1934360	What does he do with the...
1934360	1938360	Is there a bunch of bikes down there?
1938360	1942360	Does he have to swim with the bike like he's rescuing it?
1942360	1944360	What a dumb thing to do.
1944360	1947360	Dangerous and stupid.
1947360	1950360	Are you worried about the bikes or about the...
1950360	1954360	I think I'm worried about the earth, yeah.
1954360	1956360	I think once we solve all our other problems
1956360	1959360	we're going to have to deal with this mountain of bikes.
1959360	1961360	If anybody had the time or the energy,
1961360	1963360	go to Huntington Beach, California
1963360	1965360	where I spent most of my time ditching high school
1965360	1969360	and most of my wallets are there.
1969360	1972360	I'm about 20 yards out.
1972360	1974360	I kept going into the water with a wallet in my pocket
1974360	1976360	and you come out with no wallet.
1976360	1977360	They're all there.
1977360	1979360	You think there's pickpockets down there?
1979360	1982360	It's those fish, man.
1982360	1983360	Oh, your wallets are up.
1983360	1984360	You just fall out.
1984360	1986360	Yeah, it was in her pocket.
1986360	1987360	Okay.
1987360	1991360	How do you feel about the Bloody Mary arms race?
1991360	1993360	About putting shit in the blood?
1993360	1994360	I feel...
1994360	1996360	You start, I'll fucking follow up.
1996360	1998360	I feel very strongly about it.
1998360	2000360	In Portland, you order a Bloody Mary...
2000360	2002360	And it comes with a sandwich on it and the whole thing?
2002360	2003360	Yeah.
2003360	2005360	Like everybody's in this arms race.
2005360	2006360	A Bloody Mary should be a small drink.
2006360	2007360	It shouldn't be a giant...
2008360	2010360	I know there's bartenders here and I don't want you guys to be offended.
2010360	2014360	It should not be in a pint glass with ice and a bunch of shit in it.
2014360	2016360	It should be a small highball glass.
2016360	2018360	It should be chilled with a lemon.
2018360	2019360	And that's it.
2019360	2020360	Right?
2022360	2023360	Was that Logan?
2023360	2024360	Who was that?
2026360	2029360	It should be a restorative drink that you drink that one
2029360	2031360	to get your shit back together
2031360	2034360	so you can start drinking booze again, like a real drink.
2034360	2036360	You shouldn't have a 19-ounce fucking Bloody Mary
2036360	2037360	with a cheeseburger on it.
2037360	2039360	Like there's places with a turkey leg dissed in it
2039360	2041360	and then there's like two snorkels coming out.
2041360	2043360	And also, if you tell the bartender,
2043360	2047360	I just want it chilled up in a glass with a lemon.
2047360	2049360	They look at you like you're fucking crazy.
2049360	2052360	That you don't want 19 things hanging off the side of it.
2052360	2053360	Yeah.
2053360	2054360	They're gonna fucking kill everybody.
2054360	2055360	All right.
2055360	2057360	Final beverage question.
2057360	2058360	This ends my segment.
2059360	2060360	So...
2060360	2061360	I'm gonna show the segment.
2061360	2063360	A lot of these kids out here
2063360	2065360	they're younger than us.
2066360	2067360	But they went to schools.
2067360	2068360	And I just want to ask,
2068360	2069360	I just got very curious about this
2069360	2072360	because I was remembering my cafeteria days.
2072360	2075360	Have they made these half pint milk cartons
2075360	2076360	easier to fucking open yet?
2076360	2078360	Or do you still have to...
2078360	2082360	It's like 25% of them you have to rip open like Wolverine
2082360	2084360	like to get in the...
2084360	2085360	You look like a fucking asshole.
2085360	2088360	And why do the jocks always know how to do it better?
2089360	2091360	What are we doing wrong?
2092360	2093360	Is it still that?
2093360	2094360	It's just a bunch of glue and paper
2094360	2097360	and you just have to like take the luck of the draw?
2097360	2098360	Yeah.
2098360	2099360	Okay. Just checking.
2099360	2100360	Why would they change that?
2100360	2101360	Who's gonna profit from that?
2101360	2103360	They put water in cartons now.
2103360	2104360	They put water in cartons.
2104360	2106360	Are they easier to open or is it the same?
2106360	2107360	Yeah.
2108360	2111360	They make you drink water out of a half pint carton?
2111360	2113360	It's better for the earth.
2117360	2119360	What about water fountains?
2119360	2120360	That's worse for the earth?
2120360	2122360	Plastic bottles.
2123360	2126360	But I mean what about the water fountains?
2126360	2129360	They never served me water in the cafeteria.
2129360	2132360	I don't know what conversation this is.
2136360	2140360	They never served you water at the cafeteria?
2140360	2142360	Yeah. No, they did not.
2142360	2143360	No.
2143360	2147360	So why are they putting water in half pint cardboard?
2147360	2149360	To save the earth.
2149360	2150360	To not use plastic.
2150360	2151360	From what?
2151360	2152360	From plastic.
2152360	2154360	They don't give you plastic bottles in the cafeteria.
2154360	2155360	They do.
2155360	2156360	Okay, they do now.
2156360	2157360	Well, that's their problem.
2157360	2158360	They should stop doing that.
2158360	2159360	Oh.
2159360	2160360	We don't have to...
2160360	2162360	Are we only talking about in the schools?
2162360	2163360	Yes.
2163360	2166360	Because I feel like I've seen them in stores.
2166360	2167360	You know, like bigger ones.
2167360	2168360	Yeah.
2168360	2169360	Right. Bigger.
2169360	2170360	Yes. That I get.
2170360	2171360	I'm talking about in school.
2171360	2172360	Cafeteria.
2172360	2173360	Okay.
2173360	2175360	When you get your mock chicken leg and your green beans and your ketchup.
2175360	2178360	Wait. The kids ones are the easiest to open at any carton.
2178360	2184360	It's those minute made ones from Jack in the Box that are the real problem.
2184360	2186360	That's the real problem.
2186360	2187360	Let me tell you.
2187360	2190360	Also, ivory poachers.
2190360	2194360	Okay. I want to bring up a guy that I met at a signing.
2194360	2197360	Because he can't... I hope he's here.
2197360	2202360	He came up and he was getting his Rick and Morty stuff signed.
2202360	2207360	And then he asked Justin and I, Justin and me, Justin and you.
2208360	2210360	Justin and we.
2210360	2218360	He got the signature and then he said, by the way, what are each of your guys' favorite Tom Petty songs?
2219360	2224360	And Justin answered and then I said, I guess Freefallen? I don't know.
2224360	2226360	Which Dino told me today was the wrong answer.
2226360	2231360	But at any rate, he just took the two answers and then he was like, okay, thanks.
2231360	2235360	And started to walk away and I was like, get back here.
2235360	2236360	Why?
2236360	2237360	You'll get to ask me that.
2237360	2244360	And he said, oh, I'm just really into Tom Petty and I really... I always ask everybody that.
2244360	2249360	And I was like, are you coming to the show and will you please come up and...
2249360	2253360	Being passionate about something so specific, I just like to meet these people.
2253360	2256360	Is Robert here? Robert, are you here? No?
2256360	2257360	No.
2257360	2259360	Oh, he shot his family. Okay.
2262360	2263360	Wait, he didn't come?
2263360	2266360	He turned Freefallen up to 11.
2266360	2267360	Get him, Free...
2269360	2270360	Freefallen.
2272360	2274360	Running down a dream bank.
2275360	2277360	Don't come around here no more.
2278360	2281360	Wait, did you invite him to the show and he didn't fucking come?
2281360	2284360	He said he was going to be at the show. I wouldn't invite him to the show.
2284360	2287360	These people went through hell and back to get into the show.
2291360	2292360	But I thought he was going to be here.
2292360	2298360	I was... I went to go see the Jeff Lynn documentary called Mr. Blue Sky, which is great.
2298360	2302360	And I was standing there, no key alive, like a small theater.
2302360	2306360	And I was standing there in a little corridor and we were so rammed together.
2306360	2308360	There was a short guy next to me with a hat.
2308360	2310360	And I couldn't see his face because he was shorter than me.
2310360	2312360	He had a big hat and he had Gandalf hair.
2312360	2316360	And he was smoking early days vape pen, but it was clearly like weed.
2316360	2319360	And he's like, hey man, you want some?
2319360	2321360	I was like, what is it? Marijuana?
2321360	2324360	He goes, yeah. I go, no, that would get me too high.
2324360	2325360	I get too high in marijuana.
2325360	2326360	I go, hash. I can do this.
2326360	2329360	Oh shit, if you know him, I'm going to have any hash.
2329360	2331360	I want that hash. Oh man.
2331360	2333360	I couldn't see his face. He had a big brim hat.
2333360	2334360	And I was like, who the fuck is this guy?
2334360	2337360	He's American, so he's not in ELO.
2337360	2339360	Who the fuck is this guy?
2339360	2340360	He sits down in front of me.
2340360	2342360	It's fucking Tom Petty.
2345360	2348360	I was like, I was so happy I didn't know that it was Tom Petty.
2348360	2351360	Because I would never have been that glib and like chatty with him.
2351360	2353360	I would have been freaking out the whole time.
2353360	2356360	He just wanted to be like, yeah, if you can score some hash oil, man,
2356360	2359360	let's fucking do that shit.
2359360	2361360	What if he just kept bugging you for the rest of your life?
2361360	2363360	He's like, hey, it's talent.
2363360	2364360	I found some hash oil.
2364360	2367360	I thought we had an agreement.
2367360	2369360	I mean, I guess I picked wrong with freefall.
2369360	2372360	And I don't know because Dino was going like, that's the wrong side.
2372360	2373360	What would you pick?
2373360	2375360	And he's like, I can't remember what he said.
2375360	2377360	But he said, I won't back down.
2377360	2379360	I'm like, well, that's just whining.
2379360	2383360	Also, isn't there a bit where like most of Tom Petty's songs
2383360	2385360	has the word down in the title?
2385360	2386360	There's like a lot of them.
2386360	2387360	It's running down a dream.
2387360	2388360	I won't back down.
2388360	2389360	I think there's a bunch more.
2389360	2392360	But the only part of freefalling I like is when he actually literally says,
2392360	2394360	and I'm free, freefalling.
2394360	2396360	Because the rest of the song is like bad mountain goats,
2396360	2399360	kind of like over specific geographic stuff.
2399360	2405360	It's like, I'm on first street eating a pretzel.
2405360	2410360	There's a goat leash and a shoe on my foot.
2410360	2412360	That's like an old singer thing.
2412360	2417360	They run out of chops and then they just start fucking grinding at specificity.
2417360	2424360	They're like, I'm on third in Wabash and 2252 in Reseda.
2424360	2427360	I know that's something old people do.
2427360	2434360	There's some plywood and it costs $3.99 a pound at Home Depot on Ventura Boulevard.
2434360	2438360	Whenever you're getting geographically specific,
2438360	2441360	you're blying some fucking...
2441360	2444360	Because young kids, we love music by 22 year olds that are...
2444360	2447360	You listen to the lyrics of the songs we love and they're just like,
2447360	2450360	I won't let you down.
2450360	2453360	I love you so much.
2453360	2455360	And we're like, you're adorable and this is awesome
2455360	2458360	and I'm going to have sex to this song.
2458360	2460360	But they're not poets.
2460360	2462360	They don't have to be because they're young.
2462360	2472360	But old people are just like, September 3rd, the day after Mother's Day.
2472360	2476360	The barometric pressure was 72%.
2476360	2480360	I get into my Chevy 57 Impala.
2480360	2482360	Stop telling me all this shit.
2482360	2485360	Get your shit out of my fucking brain.
2485360	2487360	Just tell me what it feels to be alive.
2487360	2488360	You don't know, do you?
2488360	2490360	You don't know.
2491360	2493360	You just have memories of random shit.
2493360	2495360	That's what Alzheimer's patients do.
2495360	2497360	I remember a fuzzy slipper.
2497360	2500360	Mom, go to bed.
2500360	2501360	Do you want to have sex?
2501360	2502360	I'm your son.
2502360	2504360	Go to bed.
2504360	2507360	But Howard Hughes is about to sing Winky Doodle.
2507360	2509360	You're wrong.
2509360	2511360	That's George Gershwin.
2511360	2513360	But you're saying you agree with Dino.
2513360	2514360	You picked the wrong song.
2514360	2515360	You picked the one that's all specific.
2515360	2517360	Because I like the part where they say,
2517360	2520360	Free fallen.
2520360	2522360	Because Tom Petty's whiny.
2522360	2525360	And so if you're going to whine about something, whine about being free.
2525360	2530360	Him saying I won't back down is kind of like, you just sound stubborn.
2530360	2533360	Johnny Cash singing I won't back down sounds badass.
2533360	2535360	I won't back down.
2535360	2540360	Like, oh shit, this guy's going to stop apartheid or something.
2540360	2545360	He won't back down from fucking, from the Third Reich.
2545360	2547360	That sounds badass.
2547360	2550360	Tom Petty sounds like, I won't back down.
2550360	2553360	It sounds like he didn't get the right kind of mustard or something.
2553360	2556360	Hey, I want a refund.
2556360	2559360	I'm not leaving here without my money back.
2559360	2561360	I won't back down.
2561360	2566360	I put my foot down because I'm a consumer watch dog.
2566360	2569360	And I won't back down.
2569360	2572360	And if you go onto my Tumblr blog,
2572360	2580360	you can see the other companies I've written to.
2580360	2583360	I won't shop at Fry's, baby.
2583360	2586360	Their customer service is rude.
2586360	2588360	How do you feel about Bob Dylan?
2588360	2590360	Are you a Bob Dylan fan?
2590360	2592360	I guess I missed out on that.
2592360	2598360	I'm sure he was very ironic and interesting in 1928.
2598360	2600360	That was his early stuff.
2600360	2603360	Because it certainly isn't very early stuff.
2603360	2604360	I get it.
2604360	2606360	I mean, I guess Easy Rider's a good movie.
2606360	2607360	I don't know.
2607360	2609360	No, I'm comparing the two.
2609360	2611360	I'm not saying Bob Dylan was an Easy Rider.
2611360	2614360	But I'm saying there's shit that you miss the boat on
2614360	2616360	and you kind of historically look and go, oh, okay.
2616360	2618360	I understand the significance.
2618360	2620360	Which are guilty pleasure at home.
2620360	2624360	Your music, if you're alone and want to wallow.
2624360	2627360	I'm assuming you and I, I think we both have talked about this before.
2627360	2629360	We like sad songs.
2629360	2631360	How old is your guilty pleasure?
2631360	2633360	I've listened to Dream Pop.
2633360	2637360	And now I listen to shit that to me is modern.
2637360	2640360	But then Aaron goes, that's from 2006.
2640360	2645360	I listened to that in grade school.
2645360	2646360	How old is she?
2646360	2649360	I'm really into the postal service or whatever.
2649360	2652360	I'm like, man, I hope my wife overhears this.
2652360	2653360	She's going to get turned on.
2653360	2655360	I'm very young and hip.
2656360	2659360	The Beetlejuice was in theaters.
2659360	2662360	Why are you?
2662360	2664360	But yeah, I don't know.
2664360	2665360	I like moody.
2665360	2666360	Spencer, how about you?
2666360	2668360	What's your go-to?
2668360	2671360	When you're at home, do you play music?
2671360	2672360	No.
2672360	2677360	I mean, when I'm driving around, I listen to either NPR, which is...
2677360	2678360	Yeah.
2678360	2680360	They do music too.
2680360	2682360	So it's not just that.
2682360	2686360	I think it's supposed to be the first show where people scream and get wounded for NPR.
2686360	2688360	I doubt that, man.
2688360	2691360	NPR is great.
2691360	2694360	Have you heard...
2694360	2696360	I heard a piece on NPR.
2696360	2697360	I don't know if this is true.
2697360	2699360	I don't know how scientifically accurate this is.
2699360	2700360	It's true.
2700360	2704360	But supposedly, the morning is becoming less and less eclectic.
2704360	2705360	No.
2705360	2706360	Is it?
2706360	2708360	It's by like six inches a year.
2708360	2709360	That's true.
2709360	2710360	Yeah.
2710360	2714360	By 2019, the morning won't be eclectic.
2714360	2715360	It's true.
2715360	2718360	It's thanks to Chris Doritos.
2718360	2722360	You guys don't listen to Morning Becomes Eclectic this week.
2722360	2723360	You'd know.
2723360	2726360	He's sitting in for Jason Bentley.
2726360	2727360	They don't get up that early.
2727360	2728360	See, they get...
2728360	2729360	They make love with the seals.
2729360	2731360	They know who Jason Bentley is.
2731360	2732360	Well, these guys do.
2732360	2737360	Dan, if you could be in a band, like a big rock band, like a major thing,
2737360	2741360	would you be lead singer, guitar, drums, bass, laying in the background,
2741360	2745360	keyboard, background singer maybe?
2745360	2746360	Background vocals.
2746360	2749360	What would you be if you could be in a huge band?
2749360	2753360	Well, are we in this hypothetical universe?
2753360	2756360	Does my talent knows no bounds and also like...
2756360	2759360	You could be as good or as bad as you want to be.
2759360	2760360	Well, then I'd be the lead singer.
2760360	2761360	Okay.
2761360	2765360	And so would every bass player.
2765360	2766360	If they could.
2766360	2767360	No, I feel like there are people that...
2767360	2769360	Otherwise, why are they on stage?
2769360	2772360	I wish I was singing boom, boom, boom, boom.
2772360	2775360	Their personalities, they would rather be slightly...
2775360	2778360	I don't believe that's true at all.
2778360	2782360	Rock bands are like five people.
2782360	2783360	If you...
2783360	2787360	Show me the second chair violinist, the LA Philharmonic.
2787360	2792360	I'll believe that she doesn't wish that she was David Lee Roth.
2792360	2801360	I don't believe that Dave Grohl didn't wish he was Kurt Cobain.
2801360	2802360	That's not too soon.
2802360	2805360	It's fucking right on time.
2805360	2806360	I don't believe it.
2806360	2807360	I think rock bands are...
2807360	2812360	The reason they're fun to watch is because there's five dudes who all hate each other
2812360	2813360	and wish that they...
2813360	2815360	I know musicians that are happy.
2815360	2816360	They're happy.
2816360	2820360	It's like I want to be on stage, but I would never want the onus of being the front man,
2820360	2821360	front woman.
2821360	2823360	But why is it an onus if you're so good?
2823360	2826360	That's why I asked, am I so good that I don't have to worry about shit?
2826360	2829360	Then yeah, I'll take all the attention.
2829360	2832360	Keanu Reeves told me we were very drunk in Vegas one time.
2832360	2833360	He's like...
2833360	2836360	Holy crap.
2836360	2837360	He's like...
2837360	2839360	His favorite thing is playing bass.
2839360	2841360	He likes playing bass and not...
2841360	2842360	He doesn't charm the crowd.
2842360	2843360	He doesn't rock out.
2843360	2844360	He just hangs his head down.
2844360	2847360	This is back in the Dog Star days, a long time ago.
2847360	2848360	And he goes...
2848360	2851360	He's like, Jeff, being in a band is the greatest thing in the world.
2851360	2854360	Like, he'd rather he's that than be a movie star.
2854360	2859360	If he had his way, he would be second to the hair in his face and no one knew that.
2859360	2864360	That doesn't mean that if God came down with a magic wand and touched his throat and made
2864360	2868360	him sound like Frank Sinatra, he wouldn't be like...
2868360	2871360	I still just want to play bass.
2871360	2875360	He'd be like, oh shit, I guess I'm the best at this.
2876360	2880360	A lot of drummers that I know don't want to be up front.
2880360	2882360	But are they good singers?
2882360	2883360	Are they good singers?
2883360	2884360	No, they want to drum.
2884360	2885360	They want to do that.
2885360	2886360	I know, but if they could...
2886360	2887360	Look at Phil Collins.
2887360	2889360	He's croaking out shit while he's drumming.
2889360	2890360	He's like...
2890360	2891360	By applause.
2891360	2896360	Are there musicians here that don't want to be a lead singer and would rather be doing
2896360	2897360	else?
2897360	2898360	You're just...
2898360	2899360	You're just...
2899360	2900360	You're just getting lies.
2900360	2903360	He's called all those people liars just now.
2904360	2912360	There's a difference between asking people if you could be at the spotlight, would you
2912360	2913360	take it?
2913360	2918360	And asking them, are you very happy to take a back seat?
2918360	2923360	I think there are people that don't want the spotlight under any circumstances.
2923360	2929360	You're taking a position that's very hard to disagree with without being uncharismatic
2929360	2932360	because I'm taking the elitist position.
2932360	2940360	I will say, in support of your point, when I was working on the...
2940360	2946360	The 81st Oscars, which I guess I probably...
2946360	2950640	Jack Black called me down because he wanted me to write his patter and he was presenting
2950640	2952240	with Jennifer Aniston.
2952240	2956360	And I had a headset on and a little clipboard and it was like, oh boy, I gotta go down and
2956360	2959360	see Mrs. Aniston and Mr. Black.
2960360	2963360	And they were like, I wrote a joke for them and then they were like, they didn't like
2963360	2966360	the joke and I had to rewrite it and I was very...
2966360	2968360	In that moment, I was very activated.
2968360	2969360	I liked it.
2969360	2974360	And if you had stuck a thermometer in me at that point and asked, are you miserable?
2974360	2975360	Do you hate them?
2975360	2977360	Do you wish you were presenting at the Oscars?
2977360	2979360	I wouldn't have said yes.
2979360	2981360	I was happy in my position.
2981360	2982360	I felt supportive.
2982360	2983360	I felt activated.
2983360	2984360	I felt content.
2984360	2989360	That's different from saying, would you switch places with Jennifer Aniston?
2989360	2991360	Which I would.
2993360	2996360	What's the first thing you would do if you were suddenly Jennifer Aniston?
2996360	2999360	Oh, so much.
2999360	3003360	I would start by making healthcare socialized.
3005360	3008360	Why do you think she hasn't already done that?
3009360	3015360	I'm sure she hasn't her little neck of the woods, but I would use her power for good.
3016360	3017360	I don't know.
3017360	3019360	This conversation is dumb.
3022360	3025360	I would suspect that you and I would both want to be lead singers, but there are people
3025360	3028360	that would rather play drums and rather be...
3028360	3029360	Right?
3029360	3030360	This guy?
3031360	3032360	Logan.
3032360	3033360	Fucking Logan.
3034360	3040360	I feel like it's a very uncharismatic thing for me to say that if you are a bass player,
3040360	3042360	you must wish you were a singer.
3042360	3043360	It's different from saying...
3043360	3045360	I don't think that's semantics.
3045360	3048360	Our language doesn't have the nuance to divide those lines.
3048360	3053360	I'm just saying, if you like being on stage and you like playing an instrument and you
3053360	3059360	like performing for people in a concert, if a fairy godmother would be able to transform
3059360	3068360	you into a person who had perfect pitch and amazing dance moves or beautiful hair or
3068360	3075360	whatever it is that makes you feel like you don't belong at the very front of the performance,
3075360	3077360	would you then do it?
3078360	3084360	At a certain point, aren't you actually kind of being dishonest if you'd say no?
3084360	3091360	You're like, no, I want to stand behind a lead singer and have everyone pointing at me
3091360	3094360	and going, let the bass player sing.
3094360	3098360	I think they would come down to more personalities, like your own thing.
3098360	3102360	Let's say you had a great head of hair and a great voice and everything, and you still
3102360	3108360	say, no, I would still like to be a role player, like be the bass player, be the drummer,
3108360	3112360	be the cello, play a second violin.
3112360	3115360	But I think when you're in a band, like you had said before, you should always surround
3115360	3117360	yourself with people that intimidate you.
3117360	3123360	So if you are in a band and the guy that's actually the lead singer, if he's not a guy
3123360	3128360	that you are like, man, I wish I could sing like that, then you're not in the right band.
3128360	3135360	If you're like, this kid, he sings like shit, but I'll let him.
3135360	3136360	You're in the wrong band.
3136360	3139360	You're actually being an asshole by not quitting that band.
3139360	3145360	And going and finding a band where the lead singer is like, holy shit, this guy's a star.
3145360	3152360	So that, if you extend that train of thought, it's like, so if you magically like, if you
3152360	3160360	had those proclivities instead of your bass player proclivities, would you, what position
3160360	3161360	of the band would you play?
3161360	3165360	It's almost like a non-question, because it's just sort of like we all, what we want is
3165360	3166360	an identity.
3166360	3167360	We want to be the guy dressed as Deadpool.
3167360	3169360	We want to be the guy that got fired by NBC.
3169360	3172360	We want to be the Mario guy.
3172360	3173360	The guy dressed as a banana.
3173360	3175360	We want to have a role.
3175360	3178360	Tasha wants to build her roofs.
3178360	3185360	All you want is a function, and to know that you're nailing it, that you're doing the
3185360	3191360	most you can, and that if you're not succeeding as much as you can, that you're still trying
3191360	3192360	and getting better.
3192360	3194360	Everyone wants to feel that way all the time.
3194360	3196360	I don't think Keith Moon wanted to be Roger Daltrey.
3196360	3199360	I think Keith Moon liked being Keith Moon, or maybe he didn't see that.
3199360	3201360	You're just using examples that are...
3201360	3206360	But there's also like a garage band that's just doing it for fun, who's never going to
3206360	3208360	want to do actual shows.
3208360	3210360	There's a couple bands like that, right?
3210360	3212360	There's like three, I think, three.
3212360	3214360	I don't want to be Dan.
3214360	3220360	I know, without trying to go to the crowd, I know there are musicians here that would
3220360	3222360	be happily never the lead singer.
3222360	3224360	We're talking in circles.
3224360	3229360	I've circumscribed this whole thing, and I'm smarter than everyone in the world.
3229360	3231360	You can't play this.
3231360	3238360	The way everyone here feels, I already feel that way, and more.
3238360	3240360	That's the bottom line.
3240360	3242360	I feel everything.
3242360	3247360	I know what it's like to be black.
3247360	3251360	It's hard, but cool.
3252360	3254360	That track.
3254360	3255360	Salty.
3255360	3256360	And a little sweet.
3256360	3260360	Dan, let's say that you were in the Philharmonic, in a big orchestra.
3260360	3261360	Jesus.
3261360	3262360	Okay.
3262360	3264360	Where it's not about first chair or second.
3264360	3266360	You can be first chair or anything you want.
3266360	3268360	What instrument would you play if you could play it?
3268360	3269360	Tuba.
3270360	3271360	Tuba?
3271360	3272360	Yeah.
3272360	3274360	Tuba or Suzathon?
3276360	3278360	No, fuck you guys.
3279360	3281360	Straight up Tuba.
3281360	3282360	Proper Tuba.
3282360	3284360	Tuba Snap.
3284360	3285360	Tuba Snap.
3285360	3288360	Yeah, because then you're in and out.
3288360	3289360	Are you?
3289360	3291360	Because how many songs have a Tuba solo?
3291360	3294360	You just show up and you're like, just be the best Tuba player.
3294360	3296360	Tuba is like the bass player of the band.
3296360	3297360	It's a bass instrument.
3297360	3301360	Yeah, so we're talking in circles here.
3301360	3302360	You want to be a bass player.
3302360	3304360	There's no lead singer in a symphony.
3304360	3305360	That's what I'm asking.
3305360	3306360	There's no superstar.
3306360	3307360	You answered my question.
3307360	3312360	I was like, you would like to play a kind of not up front instrument.
3312360	3316360	It's a specific flavor because I would want to stand out.
3316360	3319360	Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
3319360	3320360	Oh, shit.
3320360	3322360	There's the Tuba.
3322360	3325360	Because if you were the best violinist in the world,
3325360	3328360	then your friend comes to see the concert and you get off stage
3328360	3331360	and they're like, good job.
3331360	3332360	And you're like, how do you know you dick?
3332360	3334360	There's like eight violinists up there.
3334360	3336360	All right, let's move on.
3338360	3343360	Uh, I don't have a favorite color, you asshole.
3344360	3346360	What are your top three, top three?
3346360	3348360	Uh, orange.
3349360	3350360	All right.
3350360	3351360	People love orange.
3351360	3353360	Baby blue.
3354360	3355360	Hiroshima.
3355360	3358360	And AIDS yellow.
3360360	3363360	Because fuck the queen.
3364360	3366360	Do you think I was just going to pander?
3366360	3368360	AIDS yellow.
3368360	3370360	The color of AIDS.
3374360	3375360	I went to Home Depot recently.
3375360	3378360	It's hard to get a good AIDS yellow.
3379360	3383360	John just AIDS the color of your AIDS.
3385360	3387360	Statistically speaking, anyone with AIDS here tonight?
3387360	3389360	Of course, of course.
3389360	3390360	Yes.
3391360	3392360	Too soon.
3393360	3394360	Banana guy.
3397360	3399360	His banana is AIDS yellow.
3404360	3406360	Banana guy's got AIDS.
3409360	3411360	Victor, do you have AIDS?
3412360	3414360	No, okay. He's clear. He's good.
3415360	3416360	All right.
3416360	3418360	So one of the things I like to do when I come to Comic-Con
3418360	3422360	is hang out with my very, very, very old friend,
3422360	3424360	as old as the hills,
3424360	3427360	who's always here with a little flower on his head
3427360	3429360	selling his little trade paperbacks
3429360	3431360	from his Canadian cartoon, Bob the Angry Flower.
3431360	3433360	Are you talking about one of my favorite people in the world?
3433360	3434360	Yeah.
3434360	3435360	Steven Notley is here.
3435360	3437360	Steven Notley, Bob the Angry Flower.
3437360	3438360	Are you going to come up, Steve?
3438360	3440360	You don't have to.
3442360	3444360	I love this guy.
3448360	3450360	I love this guy.
3460360	3462360	Hello, Steven. How are you, man?
3462360	3463360	I'm okay.
3463360	3465360	I thought you were kidding when you said you were going to do this.
3465360	3466360	Do what?
3466360	3467360	I didn't say it.
3467360	3469360	I thought you were kidding.
3469360	3470360	All right.
3470360	3471360	If you don't know Steven Notley,
3471360	3475360	he writes a hilarious and poignant and trenchant little comic strip
3475360	3476360	and ink and paper.
3476360	3478360	I use two of those words when I'm pitching.
3478360	3479360	Is it right?
3479360	3480360	I don't say poignant.
3480360	3481360	But trenchant.
3481360	3482360	Yes.
3482360	3483360	Maybe salient?
3483360	3484360	I do say salient.
3484360	3486360	It's called Bob the Angry Flower,
3486360	3488360	and it's great commentary.
3488360	3490360	It's quite wonderfully drawn.
3490360	3494360	And it expresses all of your impotent rage
3494360	3497360	and righteous indignation that's very cool.
3497360	3498360	Yeah.
3498360	3500360	You're one of my oldest and nerdiest friends.
3500360	3503360	If you combine the old and the nerdy,
3503360	3505360	you're definitely into one scale.
3505360	3507360	That's definitely your top of the list.
3507360	3509360	If you sort by nerdy and oldy.
3509360	3513360	Do you remember when you were sitting in my one bedroom apartment
3513360	3516360	while I was writing Monster House and for some reason I had cocaine
3516360	3520360	and we were trying cocaine and I was writing Monster House?
3520360	3521360	I do.
3521360	3522360	I remember that.
3522360	3527360	And it had the tenor of a proto-Harmontown kind of encounter
3527360	3530360	where it was like, we don't really do cocaine here,
3530360	3533360	but let's just do this anyway because I have some.
3533360	3534360	I just had some.
3534360	3537360	Because when I moved to LA, I found out you could just call someone
3537360	3538360	and have it delivered.
3538360	3539360	Acquire cocaine.
3539360	3541360	And that wasn't the gays in Milwaukee.
3541360	3543360	So I was like, okay, I'll take some of that too.
3543360	3545360	It's like cinnamon sticks.
3545360	3549360	And then it turns out cocaine is kind of a lot of fun.
3549360	3552360	We got a lot of talking done about technology and stuff.
3552360	3555360	And then you spent a lot of time doing stuff like this,
3555360	3557360	like very excitedly.
3557360	3559360	Yeah, and then I tried to write Monster House
3559360	3562360	and I was like, the house is a monster.
3562360	3567360	That's why the third act is just like, let me find some dynamite.
3567360	3573360	But I remember way back then you blew my mind with this concept
3573360	3583360	that you introduced me to, which is the idea that intelligence is a field
3583360	3586360	that is the actual thing that is alive in the universe
3586360	3590360	and that DNA, life itself, is sort of a subset of that
3590360	3593360	because there's an intelligence to the universe.
3593360	3598360	Not intelligent design.
3598360	3601360	That information, let's say information, not intelligence.
3601360	3605360	Does anybody have any coke?
3605360	3612360	That the idea is that genetically reproduced life is sort of the pawn in the game.
3613360	3617360	The reason why there's living things on Earth,
3617360	3623360	eating each other and evolving based on which person or thing it's eaten
3623360	3628360	is because overall there's just this drive by this field
3628360	3631360	that wants to continue to store more and more information.
3631360	3636360	I was sort of summarizing stuff that a guy named Robert Wright has written about.
3636360	3640360	He's got a book called Non-Zero that he talks about this in great depth,
3640360	3644360	which is basically like there's zero sum encounters.
3644360	3648360	Like if you're playing tennis, if you win, then I lose. Zero sum.
3648360	3653360	But there are encounters in which there are non-zero sum that both can win.
3653360	3660360	And entropy is the bad side of it, but the good side is you put energy in,
3660360	3664360	you can have things that both sides get more out of it.
3664360	3666360	There's an entropy cost.
3666360	3671360	But like basically things become more complicated and glommed together
3671360	3674360	and then those things become more complicated and glommed together.
3674360	3679360	And that just happens, whether you're a quirk or an atom or a molecule.
3679360	3681360	Or a Lobo or a zip head.
3681360	3683360	Or a Lobo or a Deadpool.
3683360	3685360	Or a tranq.
3685360	3690360	Or a worm or a person or a corporation or a human being
3690360	3695360	or a robo-galactic mega brain or a flower.
3695360	3700360	And so the idea being that as far as our position in this whole thing
3700360	3705360	is that we are the pinnacle of genetic information evolution.
3705360	3707360	We have that we know.
3707360	3711360	We have chromosomes jammed into the cells of our body
3711360	3717360	that are so coiled up and so stuffed into each cell's nucleus
3717360	3724360	that the operation of them splitting takes this enormously complicated process
3724360	3729360	because it's just spools and spools and spools of molecular information.
3729360	3734360	But the sum total of that is that we're these monkeys that have these brains
3734360	3736360	and we're building these computers.
3736360	3740360	And we're creating new ways to store information.
3740360	3743360	And we seem to be doing it compulsively.
3743360	3748360	Not all of those things make us better monkeys.
3748360	3753360	We seem compelled to keep advancing our way of storing
3753360	3757360	and transferring information sometimes directly in spite
3757360	3760360	of what actually profits us as primates.
3760360	3765360	And so it's almost as if we're being compelled by some horrible larger,
3765360	3769360	maybe not horrible, maybe wonderful, but certainly not a thing that's rooting for us.
3769360	3772360	Something that's kind of like using us as a little slipper
3772360	3775360	that it's going to get tired of and step out of and move on from.
3775360	3779360	Well the way I would look at it is like if you look at yourself,
3780360	3783360	you consider yourself to be a singular entity, right?
3783360	3785360	You are Dan Harmon.
3785360	3789360	But at the same time, you are a corporation made up of trillions and trillions
3789360	3792360	of cells that make up Dan Harmon.
3792360	3795360	Thank you.
3795360	3798360	And those cells are individual living beings.
3798360	3805360	And there is a long history of those cells learning how to be living,
3805360	3809360	like how to make up a corporation of tens of trillions of trillions of cells
3809360	3812360	that can actually work as a gigantic corporation,
3812360	3818360	all doing their little jobs to be this thing that on the level of a cell,
3818360	3821360	you could not imagine cells don't picture that the thing that they make up
3821360	3824360	is conscious in the way that they know.
3824360	3827360	If they're just like, well, here I am, a capillary cell,
3827360	3830360	and I've got my buddies here, we're all sort of pasted together
3830360	3832360	and we see all the dudes go by and blah, blah, blah.
3833360	3837360	You ever think about God, you ever think about there's a guy named Dan
3837360	3839360	that we're all a part of?
3839360	3842360	It's like, shut up and do your job, man, like process that oxygen.
3845360	3847360	But you are that entity.
3847360	3848360	Right.
3848360	3851360	And now we also make up other entities.
3851360	3854360	We are parts of corporations, we're parts of nations.
3854360	3859360	We do not think that the thing United States has an identity,
3859360	3864360	it's a piece of self in the way that we ourselves think that we have that.
3864360	3866360	But why do we think that?
3866360	3870360	It's completely arbitrary that we, only we, this collection,
3870360	3876360	this assemblage of matter and life have the capacity to have an identity
3876360	3879360	and none others do.
3879360	3883360	I mean, what would this, what would the macro picture look like
3883360	3887360	if we were all, would it end at the outskirts of the earth?
3887360	3891360	Are we just stuck on this blue marble and like connecting with each other
3891360	3896360	and trying to form a multicellular organism on the planet that will then reproduce?
3896360	3897360	I hope so.
3897360	3900360	Or is it more sinister than that?
3900360	3904360	I hope so and it is more sinister than that.
3904360	3908360	Is it, maybe there's another planet like many light years away
3908360	3910360	that's having the same experience happen to it
3910360	3915360	and the actual overriding principle is that we're supposed to combine with that
3915360	3919360	and we have absolutely no say in where this goes.
3919360	3920360	Who cares though, right?
3920360	3923360	I mean, I guess, well, no, we all care.
3923360	3924360	Everybody's got a stake in it.
3924360	3927360	Not only every human being but everything in the universe
3927360	3930360	has a stake in its own existence.
3930360	3933360	You know, like five million, ten million years ago
3933360	3935360	there was no such thing as human beings.
3935360	3938360	Fifty million years from now they will look back and go,
3938360	3939360	oh, that's right.
3939360	3946360	There's no such thing as like some kind of Borg-like entity
3946360	3949360	that covers, you know, like light years of space and time.
3949360	3952360	How much time do you think we have as humans?
3952360	3957360	I'm going to defer to Dan on that one.
3957360	3961360	Stephen, the joke with Dan and I when we meet Stephen was always,
3961360	3964360	what's currently your biggest concern?
3964360	3965360	You were like super volcanoes.
3965360	3967360	Oh, that's so old.
3968360	3970360	What right now is your main, like what's the...
3970360	3972360	Plastic bottles.
3972360	3973360	Plastic bottles.
3973360	3974360	That's the main thing?
3974360	3975360	Oh, yeah.
3975360	3977360	I'm just terrified now.
3977360	3980360	My biggest fear now, have you ever watched that doomsday prepper show?
3980360	3982360	You're more worried about plastic bottles than super volcanoes?
3982360	3983360	Yes.
3983360	3984360	Did you guys...
3984360	3986360	Plastic bottles are pretty immediate, I would say.
3986360	3988360	Did you think they're immediate?
3988360	3994360	Hear that Tom Selleck was stealing water to water his avocado orchards?
3994360	3996360	Stealing it from who?
3996360	3999360	From the city, no, the county of Ventura.
3999360	4000360	He's...
4000360	4001360	That's where I hail from.
4001360	4002360	He stole water?
4002360	4007360	Yeah, he hired people to collect water and then they brought it to his...
4007360	4008360	I read about that.
4008360	4009360	That's some fucked up shit, man.
4009360	4012360	I'd imagine they're watering his mustache though, you know?
4012360	4015360	Does he sell avocados or does he just...
4015360	4018360	He owns an orchard or a farm or something, yeah.
4018360	4019360	He loves guacamole.
4019360	4022360	He has these parties where he's like...
4022360	4025360	If you haven't had Tom Selleck's guacamole,
4025360	4028360	you have not had guacamole.
4028360	4031360	I'll tell you my big panic, it's not water bottles,
4031360	4035360	although it sounds like I need to learn more about the immediacy of that.
4035360	4040360	My new thing is, it's just economic collapse.
4040360	4047360	It's just the idea that everything is based on this fake idea
4047360	4050360	that something's worth something compared to something else
4050360	4055360	and that if the American dollar was worth a dollar on Monday
4055360	4058360	and then was worth 70 cents on Tuesday,
4058360	4061360	the six hours from then,
4061360	4064360	there would be fires on the horizon like Blade Runner
4064360	4068360	and then six hours from that, cops would stop showing up for work
4068360	4070360	because they'd be like, that shit's on fire
4070360	4075360	and I'm going to go home and protect my family with my gun from work.
4075360	4082360	Before I worry about something as cool as a supervolcano,
4082360	4085360	it's just very cool, a cool thing to worry about.
4085360	4087360	Everybody read about supervolcanoes
4087360	4090360	because I don't want to diss your concern about supervolcanoes.
4090360	4093360	They are a great way for humanity to be exterminated.
4093360	4095360	You were the first one to lay this out.
4095360	4100360	Five years ago, you were very concerned about the supervolcano under Yosemite.
4100360	4102360	And now not so much.
4103360	4105360	But I would agree with you.
4105360	4107360	The economic problem is...
4107360	4112360	I want to build a big bomb shelter underground
4112360	4116360	and just have water and shotguns and dogs.
4116360	4123360	I'm worried that just water and dogs, that everything else will be okay.
4123360	4127360	Yeah, because I think you can milk dogs and live off of them.
4127360	4129360	And feed the water.
4129360	4131360	I'll have mice for the dogs to eat.
4131360	4134360	I think if you could milk dogs, we would already have done that.
4134360	4139360	If you could get a dog to milk another dog, we would have done that.
4139360	4141360	But if you teach him to fish...
4141360	4144360	We really fuck dogs up. We fuck dogs up.
4144360	4149360	We're close to the ideal and idealized economic metaphor.
4149360	4152360	We're starting out with, we love it on Desert Island
4152360	4155360	and you get two coconuts and I catch one fish and we'll...
4155360	4158360	Yeah, we're all fucked up.
4158360	4162360	But now that we've moved into dog water milking systems...
4162360	4167360	When you see a schnauzer, that's a regular dog
4167360	4171360	whose limbs have been bred to be little flippers.
4171360	4173360	But I do want to return to what you were saying.
4173360	4177360	The economic concern, which I would summarize as going...
4177360	4180360	The problem being that even though everybody here...
4180360	4183360	We're all capitalists, right? Capitalism? Yeah?
4183360	4185360	Yeah.
4185360	4187360	Capitalism! Oh, boo!
4187360	4190360	Also correct.
4190360	4192360	Almost the same now because...
4192360	4193360	But the weird thing is...
4193360	4196360	Any anarchosynicalists out there.
4196360	4200360	But even the hard people who self-identify as capitalism,
4200360	4202360	you've got to go, what is capitalism?
4202360	4206360	Is the understanding that capital plus labor equals wealth?
4206360	4207360	No.
4207360	4210360	Well, no, it is. That's capital.
4210360	4214360	Workers create wealth, wealth is accumulated,
4214360	4217360	that becomes capital. Land is capital.
4217360	4219360	If I own a piece of land, that's capital.
4219360	4222360	But I can't make it productive without workers.
4222360	4226360	Workers create wealth, but capitalists own all the wealth.
4226360	4228360	Exactly.
4228360	4230360	Wait, I don't want to miss this point.
4230360	4233360	I'm too stupid. Take me through this.
4233360	4236360	Like a children's book.
4236360	4240360	Capital is the unpaid portion of labor.
4240360	4243360	Surplus is the unpaid portion.
4243360	4246360	If everybody got paid for what their work was actually...
4246360	4247360	There would be no profit.
4247360	4248360	There would be no capital.
4248360	4249360	Right, right.
4249360	4251360	Capital is the part that you don't pay your laborers.
4251360	4254360	So to the extent that we don't pay our workers, that's capital.
4254360	4256360	That's profit.
4256360	4259360	I own something. I have property rights. I own it.
4259360	4262360	Now, my ownership of it does not allow it to become productive.
4262360	4264360	I apply labor to it.
4264360	4267360	I pay the laborers something less than I sell it for.
4267360	4269360	The gap is my profit,
4269360	4273360	which then I feed back into my additional capital.
4273360	4275360	So I become richer and richer,
4275360	4278360	but then I also push forward the story, which is that basically,
4278360	4283360	oh, money and wealth is a function of owning and being rich,
4283360	4288360	rather than no, money is created by people who work.
4288360	4289360	It's just that simple.
4289360	4291360	And yet you don't really quite hear people go like,
4291360	4294360	oh, well, all these rich people,
4294360	4297360	like you don't want to take their value or their wealth.
4297360	4302360	It's like, well, it is their wealth because they own the means of production,
4302360	4304360	but it's not like they made it.
4304360	4308360	The people who made it made it.
4310360	4315360	I think we could make this a little clearer for the common man,
4315360	4317360	even though I understand it.
4317360	4321360	If I do it as a wrap.
4327360	4331360	Yeah.
4331360	4332360	Yeah.
4332360	4333360	Yeah.
4333360	4335360	Capitalism.
4335360	4336360	Yeah.
4336360	4340360	It's forming a schism between the rich and the poor.
4340360	4345360	It's like jism starting over.
4345360	4346360	Yeah.
4346360	4348360	I fucked your mama.
4348360	4351360	I fucked your mama.
4351360	4353360	I fucked your mama so hard.
4353360	4354360	It hurt.
4354360	4358360	I fucked your mama like my name was John Hurt.
4358360	4361360	It's the same word.
4361360	4363360	Sorry.
4363360	4365360	Starting over.
4365360	4366360	Yeah.
4366360	4368360	Yeah.
4368360	4369360	A dollar's worth this.
4369360	4371360	A dollar's worth that.
4371360	4375360	I fucked your mama until she was blind as a bat,
4375360	4377360	flying around using sonar.
4377360	4378360	I fucked your mama.
4378360	4380360	I got a bonar.
4380360	4383360	I put it inside her.
4383360	4387360	And she was like, that's quieter.
4387360	4388360	Starting over.
4388360	4390360	Starting over.
4390360	4394360	Oh, you were doing a surplus value.
4394360	4396360	Yo, what's up with that shirt?
4396360	4399360	Yo, are you going to work?
4399360	4402360	Yo, what's up with your hair?
4402360	4405360	Yo, don't take the stairs.
4405360	4406360	Starting over.
4406360	4407360	Didn't work in the car.
4407360	4408360	Didn't work either.
4408360	4410360	Yo.
4410360	4411360	Yo.
4411360	4412360	Yeah.
4412360	4413360	Yeah.
4413360	4414360	Yes.
4414360	4415360	Yes.
4415360	4416360	Yes.
4416360	4417360	Yes.
4417360	4418360	Yes.
4418360	4419360	Yes, yes.
4419360	4420360	Yes.
4420360	4421360	Yes, yes.
4421360	4422360	Capitol.
4422360	4423360	Capitol.
4423360	4424360	Rap.
4424360	4425360	Rap, Rap, Rap and Rap.
4425360	4426360	Rap and Rap.
4426360	4427360	I'm going to have a rap attack.
4427360	4428360	I'm going to rap good.
4428360	4429360	I'm going to rap good.
4429360	4430360	I'm going to rap good.
4430360	4431360	And I'm rapping real good.
4431360	4432360	Just starting over.
4432360	4433360	Starting over.
4433360	4434360	There are seven wonders of the world.
4434360	4438360	This rapping is about to be worth it.
4439360	4440360	Yo.
4440360	4443360	I went out to the street.
4443360	4446360	I needed some bread and I got some meat.
4446360	4450360	I was on a protein diet so I had the latter.
4450360	4453360	I fucked your mama like she was pancake batter.
4453360	4456360	I poured her pussy into a pan.
4456360	4458360	I fucked her as hard as I can.
4458360	4464360	But it wasn't hard enough so I got a new job sucking your dad's knob.
4464360	4467360	I love your dad now.
4467360	4470360	I love your dad now.
4470360	4471360	Progressive.
4471360	4473360	I love your dad now.
4473360	4474360	Progressive.
4474360	4475360	Chicka, chicka, chicka.
4475360	4476360	Love your dad now.
4476360	4478360	Your dad made love to me.
4478360	4481360	He fucked him so hard that I broke my knee.
4481360	4482360	Oh shit.
4482360	4485360	Don't fucking try to stop me.
4485360	4487360	Try to shut me down.
4487360	4488360	No.
4488360	4489360	No.
4489360	4491360	Just kidding on a roll.
4491360	4492360	Yo.
4492360	4493360	Yo.
4493360	4494360	Yo.
4494360	4496360	I met your dad in the fall of 72.
4496360	4499360	I fucked him so hard I lost one of my shoes.
4499360	4501360	I was like where did it go?
4501360	4502360	He said.
4511360	4514360	There's a guy that's mad at the back now.
4514360	4515360	Alright.
4517360	4518360	9-11.
4522360	4523360	Alright that didn't work.
4523360	4524360	You can't force it.
4524360	4525360	You can't force it.
4525360	4529360	I think we learned a lot about the nature of capitalism.
4531360	4532360	I hope so.
4532360	4534360	I think there's 500 people here.
4534360	4536360	Even if you force it.
4536360	4537360	Force it.
4554360	4559360	For those of you who are only listening, Dan was presented by a hilarious gentleman with
4559360	4562360	a Bloody Mary with everything on top of it.
4562360	4565360	A BLT is on it.
4565360	4569360	Did the people at Tynroof make this or was this assembled by...
4569360	4570360	I don't know.
4570360	4571360	Also I wouldn't drink it.
4571360	4573360	I think it was phoned in from Alaska.
4574360	4577360	Nicky and Nicole made this out of the...
4578360	4579360	Thank you.
4579360	4580360	Nicky and Nicole.
4580360	4581360	Nicky or Nicole?
4581360	4582360	Wait.
4582360	4583360	Do they work here?
4583360	4584360	May I get a Fernet Bronco by any chance?
4584360	4586360	Have you got Fernet Bronco back there?
4586360	4587360	Okay.
4587360	4588360	Upstairs?
4588360	4590360	What's their name upstairs?
4591360	4592360	Upstairs.
4592360	4593360	Can I get a Fernet Bronco?
4593360	4594360	Make a human...
4594360	4596360	We can make a human chain and get me a Fernet Bronco.
4596360	4597360	So you're still on the Fernet?
4597360	4599360	Like I wondered if you'd moved on from there.
4603360	4604360	Motherfucker.
4604360	4605360	The cheeseburger.
4605360	4606360	How is it?
4606360	4608360	This is the best Bloody Mary I've ever had in my life.
4613360	4616360	Let's bring my soulmate up, Aaron McGathey.
4620360	4623360	You want to do a rap?
4623360	4624360	Rap it.
4624360	4625360	Rap it out.
4625360	4626360	Rap it out.
4626360	4628360	Yours backstage for a long time.
4628360	4631360	Waiting for a rap.
4631360	4632360	Yeah, keep rapping.
4632360	4648360	Krasig Park, Don't Know If The Bit Went Well, was unceremoniously excused when I can't walk
4648360	4649360	in these shoes.
4649360	4650360	Welcome to McGassatec.
4650360	4651360	This is McGassatec.
4651360	4652360	My favorite color is red orange.
4652360	4653360	A favorite color is just like having a favorite movie.
4653360	4654360	You just see it and you like it.
4654360	4655360	When you see a favorite movie and you have a favorite movie, it doesn't mean you want
4655360	4656360	to live in it.
4656360	4657360	You just like it more than the other movies.
4657360	4658360	It's like having a favorite in anything.
4658360	4659360	Colors.
4659360	4660360	Yeah.
4660360	4661360	Color!
4661360	4662360	White is all the colors together.
4662360	4663360	Yeah.
4663360	4664360	Yeah.
4664360	4665360	Yeah.
4665360	4666360	Oh my God.
4666360	4695360	But
4696360	4698360	is Citizen Kane better or worse than Star Wars?
4698360	4700360	And that's like, oh, what's my favorite movie?
4700360	4701360	It doesn't...
4701360	4702360	Well, okay.
4702360	4703360	Come on.
4703360	4704360	Star Wars.
4704360	4705360	You're racing.
4705360	4706360	People have favorite movies all the time.
4706360	4707360	And you have a favorite movie, too.
4707360	4715360	That was Luke Skywalker losing his sled.
4715360	4722360	We hadn't planned the end of that bit or any of that bit.
4723360	4727360	And I'll tell you, there are a few things sadder than walking off the stage in these shoes
4727360	4730360	down that thing.
4730360	4731360	Why is that sad?
4731360	4738360	Because I can't walk in these shoes because these are these crazy heels from that movie.
4738360	4741360	And also, no woman ever wants to be sent to her paddock.
4741360	4744360	Even if she owns the paddocks.
4744360	4747360	Even if she drives, there are hers.
4747360	4748360	Yes.
4748360	4749360	All right.
4749360	4751360	So, how's it going?
4751360	4752360	All right.
4752360	4753360	Any complaints?
4753360	4759360	I rapped about the color thing.
4759360	4760360	But what is that?
4760360	4762360	Seriously, you have a favorite color?
4762360	4763360	Yes.
4763360	4764360	Red, orange.
4764360	4765360	Red, orange.
4765360	4766360	Can't even pick.
4766360	4769360	Not red and orange, but like a red orange.
4769360	4770360	Yeah.
4770360	4771360	Okay.
4771360	4773360	My favorite is blue, yellow, green.
4773360	4775360	I guess I'm better at it.
4775360	4778360	So that's like a teal.
4778360	4779360	Okay.
4779360	4782360	It's more like double green, isn't it?
4782360	4784360	What's your favorite color, Spencer?
4784360	4786360	It's extra green.
4786360	4787360	Yeah.
4787360	4788360	Just extra green.
4788360	4790360	My favorite color is green.
4790360	4791360	It's a good color.
4791360	4793360	It's a funny thing to be mad about.
4793360	4795360	I think you should let people do their own thing.
4795360	4796360	I mean, why do you care?
4796360	4797360	I'm not telling them to do anything.
4797360	4801360	You're telling them to die because they like colors.
4801360	4804360	I announce that I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
4804360	4808360	And they fucking, they rose up and they're like, finally someone says it.
4809360	4810360	Who has a favorite color?
4810360	4813360	They're like, finally, finally the fucking.
4813360	4818360	So here has a, who likes, who likes a color?
4818360	4821360	Thank you.
4821360	4825360	Who has a favorite one?
4825360	4826360	All right.
4826360	4827360	Well, let's go.
4827360	4830360	I'm going to, I wish we had a wireless mic because I just want to like, I just want to
4830360	4833360	run through and get everyone's favorite color.
4833360	4836360	Why would you stop people from that?
4836360	4837360	I'm what I don't want to.
4837360	4839360	I want to, I want to celebrate it.
4839360	4840360	You have lots of cord there.
4840360	4841360	I think you can probably run.
4841360	4842360	I don't think I can make it out.
4842360	4843360	Check it out.
4843360	4845360	You have lots of cable there in front of you.
4845360	4852360	Oh, you're the one person I'm not going to ask.
4852360	4861360	Now, Dan, you came down pretty hard on Bloody Mary's navy blue is the Tim Allen of colors.
4861360	4862360	Oh shit.
4862360	4864360	Harvard's full of protein now.
4864360	4873360	I just inhaled a piece of burger.
4873360	4877360	Yeah, I'm fine.
4877360	4882360	You know how when you just a fleck of food goes into your lungs.
4882360	4884360	It's not going to kill me.
4884360	4888360	It's just going to bum me out for the next hour.
4888360	4891360	See what they said.
4891360	4894360	They said you're great.
4894360	4895360	Davidson gray.
4895360	4896360	What?
4896360	4897360	Davidson gray.
4897360	4899360	That's a good color.
4899360	4901360	That's the navy blue guy.
4901360	4909360	Why don't we do a rainbow prism from red to purple and you applaud for your favorite color.
4909360	4911360	McGathey white.
4911360	4913360	That's just the navy blue guy.
4913360	4919360	His favorite color is pandering.
4920360	4924360	He's a fucking shmoo.
4924360	4925360	You guys take over the show.
4925360	4926360	I'm going to die.
4926360	4928360	You're going to fucking die.
4928360	4930360	You flew too close to the sun, Nickeris.
4930360	4932360	I inhaled.
4932360	4938360	The color wheel is horseshit because it's not a wheel.
4938360	4941360	It starts at ultraviolet and goes to infrared.
4941360	4945360	We just curl it up because we can't see anymore.
4945360	4948360	Oh shit.
4948360	4950360	Science snap.
4950360	4952360	You guys have to...
4952360	4953360	Colors are all perceptive.
4953360	4954360	You have to take over the show.
4954360	4955360	Starting at red.
4955360	4956360	I'm going to die.
4956360	4957360	Do you need the heimlich?
4957360	4961360	The guy who's telling you colors are bad can't swallow properly.
4961360	4963360	Which is something that babies can do.
4963360	4967360	Also, you came out, you opened with you hate buddy marriage with food in it.
4967360	4969360	Now he's going to kill you.
4969360	4972360	I like the food pipe.
4972360	4974360	I'll explain something here.
4974360	4975360	Here's why you don't like food when you drink.
4975360	4977360	You try to drink your food.
4977360	4979360	You can't drink food.
4979360	4981360	As you drink over 40 years.
4981360	4983360	Here we go.
4983360	4985360	Starting at the top of the rainbow.
4985360	4987360	Red.
4987360	4989360	Orange.
4989360	4991360	Yellow.
4991360	4993360	Green.
4993360	4995360	Blue.
4995360	4996360	Cool.
4996360	4998360	Blue.
4998360	5000360	Purple.
5000360	5002360	Interesting.
5002360	5003360	Smart crowd, right?
5004360	5006360	You know what I like?
5006360	5008360	Black is the absence of all color.
5008360	5010360	I like sea foam green once in a while.
5010360	5011360	I like a nice sea foam.
5011360	5012360	I love it.
5012360	5015360	These MC John shirts are all in sea foam green.
5015360	5017360	Minty 90's color.
5017360	5019360	Black is the absence of all color.
5019360	5022360	But if we're doing a different scale, who loves black?
5022360	5026360	Jeff Davis suit gray.
5026360	5028360	White.
5028360	5030360	Yeah.
5030360	5032360	Who hates all colors?
5033360	5035360	I'm on a crew.
5035360	5037360	Grayscale.
5037360	5043360	I'm just warning you guys, you kids, your esophageal flap.
5043360	5046360	You know how your toilet, some of you guys have apartments.
5046360	5048360	Have you had to fix your toilet?
5048360	5053360	Because there's like a little flap that makes it sealed and then the tank can fill up without her.
5053360	5055360	You know how it rots away.
5055360	5057360	And you have to replace it.
5057360	5059360	42.
5059360	5061360	Vodka.
5061360	5064360	And then it's like it doesn't seal all the way.
5064360	5067360	I'm just warning you, drink smoothies.
5067360	5070360	Dan, have you ever hidden anything in your toilet tank?
5070360	5071360	Thanks, Steve.
5071360	5073360	Oh, thank you, Steve.
5073360	5076360	Steve was one of the Raptors earlier.
5076360	5078360	Can I have a sip of your Bloody Mary?
5078360	5080360	Yeah.
5080360	5081360	Oh, my God.
5081360	5084360	What if that's how I had died?
5084360	5085360	Oh, man.
5085360	5087360	San Diego's my hometown.
5087360	5090360	It's nice to...
5090360	5094360	We're still in Bankers Hill.
5094360	5095360	Just keep going.
5095360	5099360	Do you have any friends here that want to talk about science or anything?
5099360	5101360	You okay, then?
5101360	5102360	No, I'm not.
5102360	5103360	But it's fine.
5103360	5105360	I'm asking as a friend.
5105360	5106360	Take the show.
5106360	5111360	I have to keep coughing up little tiny molecules of burger.
5111360	5116360	Because I inhaled and it slid down past the esophageal flap.
5116360	5121360	There's a little Han Solo has invaded the Death Star of my body.
5121360	5123360	Wash it down with some bacon.
5123360	5128360	Was anybody at the Star Wars panel?
5128360	5129360	That must have been tremendous.
5129360	5131360	Like Harrison Ford came out.
5131360	5134360	You weren't told that any of those people were going to show up, right?
5134360	5137360	Carrie Fisher showed up and Harrison Ford showed up.
5137360	5140360	And then J.J. Abrams took them all out.
5140360	5143360	Andy Kaufman style said, we're all going to a concert.
5143360	5148360	The San Diego Philharmonic played Star Wars.
5148360	5149360	You went to my panel.
5149360	5150360	Thank you.
5150360	5157360	Where we had to try to do a Rick and Morty table read under the fireworks from J.J. Abrams.
5157360	5158360	Didn't that help?
5158360	5159360	No, it was fine.
5159360	5161360	It was great.
5161360	5163360	Have I ever met Kevin Smith?
5163360	5167360	His panel was after the Star Wars panel.
5167360	5171360	And so there was just no one there.
5171360	5173360	I'm not laughing at his misfortune.
5173360	5175360	Yeah, you are.
5175360	5176360	It's fine.
5176360	5180360	We all do.
5180360	5181360	He's fine.
5181360	5183360	He's Kevin Smith.
5183360	5184360	Okay.
5184360	5185360	Touchy points.
5185360	5187360	Dave Grohl and Kevin Smith for these guys.
5187360	5189360	I think that was Kurt Cobain, though.
5189360	5192360	It was Kurt Cobain they were reacting to.
5192360	5194360	Everyone loves that guy for some reason.
5194360	5197360	Was Dave Grohl here?
5198360	5201360	I was at a bar in New York.
5201360	5204360	And then Dave Grohl had just played Foo Fighters and he wrote a bar.
5204360	5208360	And he comes down and he just played for fucking three hours.
5208360	5210360	He plays like he's indefatigable on stage.
5210360	5212360	And he had diapers with him.
5212360	5214360	He's holding a bag of diapers.
5214360	5217360	And I said, do you have a baby or are you just really eccentric?
5217360	5219360	And he goes, oh, shit, man.
5219360	5222360	I wish I was that eccentric.
5222360	5223360	I got a baby.
5223360	5227360	He puts one on in the middle of a guitar solo that takes so long
5227360	5230360	and he eats a piece of pizza and doesn't stop until he shits it out.
5230360	5234360	What's the name of the animator who created Bugs Bunny?
5234360	5236360	Tex Avery.
5236360	5240360	Tex Avery was such a workaholic and so dedicated to his work
5240360	5245360	that he would push his bladder so far when he was working
5245360	5247360	and he wouldn't want to get up and go to the bathroom.
5247360	5251360	It was like a thing about him until one day his bladder burst.
5252360	5254360	Like it was working so hard that it was flat.
5254360	5257360	And it went, go, go.
5257360	5259360	It went, edit it up.
5259360	5260360	That's poop, doc.
5260360	5263360	I still have half a hamburger lodged right on the lip of my esophagus.
5263360	5265360	No, you can work back from that and go like,
5265360	5271360	what classic Bugs Bunny cartoon did that incident inspire?
5271360	5274360	I thought it was one of the good ones.
5274360	5276360	Was it What's Opera, doc?
5276360	5278360	What's Opera, doc is the best one.
5278360	5279360	It's probably that one.
5279360	5282360	I can tell how much money they spent on Looney Tunes cartoons
5282360	5285360	by how many whiskers are on Bugs Bunny
5285360	5290360	because it took longer and took more money to track the whiskers.
5295360	5297360	Comics, right?
5297360	5298360	Cartoons, they're funny.
5298360	5301360	Can I check in about, I don't know how much time we've done.
5301360	5303360	I black out at a certain point.
5303360	5305360	I would say we started at 7.15.
5305360	5307360	We have about a half hour.
5308360	5312360	So we'll check in with Spencer for five to seven minutes.
5312360	5313360	Yeah.
5313360	5315360	How's your Comic Con been?
5315360	5316360	It's been pretty good.
5316360	5320360	I found out that that health app on your iPhone
5320360	5324360	is just constantly tracking you without you telling it to.
5324360	5325360	And I've been walking.
5325360	5327360	Can you get a message on your phone that just said stop?
5327360	5328360	Yeah.
5328360	5329360	And I was like, what?
5329360	5330360	Stop fucking bro.
5330360	5332360	Your heart is about to give out.
5332360	5333360	It's really helpful.
5333360	5335360	It's going to save lives.
5335360	5337360	The iWatch in stores now.
5337360	5342360	Anyway, no, I've been walking like 12 miles a day or something.
5342360	5344360	Not today because I was dead.
5344360	5347360	But yeah, no, I'm just exhausted, man.
5347360	5349360	Oh, yeah.
5349360	5350360	It's fun.
5350360	5354360	I lost my badge at some point.
5354360	5357360	I heard that somebody snarfed it off of you like New Orleans style.
5357360	5360360	It could have been that or it could have just been like caught
5360360	5362360	by an errant wind or something.
5362360	5364360	But it was around your neck.
5364360	5365360	Yeah, that's the thing.
5365360	5369360	It might have been the notorious San Diego badge snarfer.
5369360	5370360	That's what I was thinking.
5370360	5371360	They're really expensive.
5371360	5374360	So it's kind of the equivalent of picking so much pocket.
5374360	5375360	It can't be hard.
5375360	5379360	With petty thievery going on, there would be like a multitude
5379360	5384360	of Spider-Man to show up and stop that happening.
5384360	5387360	Do you think it's possible for somebody to get that close to you
5387360	5391360	and actually unclip the thing from the lanyard?
5391360	5394360	I think that's not what happened, but it's absolutely possible.
5394360	5395360	What do you think happened?
5395360	5400360	I think probably I brushed by someone and it activated the clasp
5400360	5403360	and de-clasped it and it like fell, fluttered to the floor
5403360	5405360	and then someone picked it up right after.
5405360	5407360	How many of those god people are for real?
5407360	5409360	I can't tell the difference between the...
5409360	5411360	Here's the thing.
5411360	5414360	A lot of people are actively antagonizing them and it's like,
5414360	5416360	why are you better?
5416360	5418360	Just because you're against them?
5418360	5419360	I don't know.
5419360	5421360	This guy that was yelling at him to suck his balls
5421360	5424360	and that they were going to hell if they didn't suck his balls,
5424360	5428360	it's like, now there's just two people being annoying.
5428360	5429360	I don't...
5429360	5431360	That's not what I want.
5435360	5438360	Everyone enjoys the con in their own way.
5438360	5441360	I'm a firm believer in if someone else starts it,
5441360	5443360	you get to finish it though.
5443360	5445360	Not that that finishes it.
5445360	5447360	I think that the Christian people should talk about
5447360	5450360	how much they repent every day if they're going to be
5450360	5452360	telling other people to repent all the time.
5452360	5453360	What if you guys found out that there...
5453360	5454360	It comes off as high-minded.
5454360	5456360	What if you found out that there's a graphic novel
5456360	5460360	about religious protesters and that those people were doing
5460360	5464360	like the most extravagant cosplay ever
5464360	5466360	and they were just like in deep character.
5466360	5468360	Well, it has happened.
5468360	5470360	We were talking about this, that there was a video game
5470360	5472360	that was coming out and they did guerrilla marketing
5472360	5474360	where they had a group of people pretending to be
5474360	5476360	Christian protesters of this game
5476360	5478360	and it broke that they...
5478360	5480360	It was fake.
5480360	5482360	That they had posed as...
5482360	5485360	They'd made a fake group of people picketing the game.
5485360	5488360	And then for some reason people got mad about that.
5488360	5492360	I'm not sure the 15-year-old version of me would get mad at that.
5492360	5494360	I would be like, well, that's cool.
5494360	5495360	Like pretending to be protesters?
5495360	5496360	Yeah.
5496360	5498360	I think that's a little weak.
5498360	5500360	Like I'm not sure why.
5500360	5501360	I don't know who it's hurting.
5501360	5509360	Because I guess it's making fun of people who are just kind of sad already.
5509360	5512360	Well, if you're one of those people then I guess you could get mad
5512360	5514360	but I don't think the people that were getting mad,
5514360	5516360	I think they were just video gamers that were like,
5516360	5518360	you shouldn't try to manipulate me.
5518360	5520360	What? I sell you video games.
5520360	5522360	Manipulate you for a living.
5522360	5524360	I convince you you're a space man.
5524360	5525360	Okay, let me put it this way.
5525360	5530360	Supposing you went around and your cosplay was like video game nerd
5530360	5533360	and you built yourself like a fat suit
5533360	5535360	and you covered yourself with Cheetos
5535360	5538360	and you became this like awful entity.
5538360	5540360	Like would that be good?
5540360	5543360	In order to evangelize the message of...
5543360	5551360	Well, you would be kind of incarnating our picture of this without really...
5551360	5553360	I got to say as long as you're not blocking traffic,
5553360	5555360	I don't mind any of that because it doesn't...
5555360	5559360	As long as you're not like obstructing anyone from doing what they want,
5559360	5562360	if all you're doing is sending messages out into the ether,
5562360	5564360	if those messages are dishonest,
5564360	5566360	then hopefully the message you could draw from that is,
5566360	5570360	oh, I should put less stock in things strangers tell me.
5570360	5575360	And I think that's a good way to grow up as a kid.
5575360	5577360	I don't know what that guy's jam is.
5577360	5579360	He's pretending to...
5579360	5582360	He's dressed like a banana but he could be a hit man.
5582360	5586360	Well, I know those people write a comic where God is a hero.
5586360	5588360	Oh, they do and they're amazing.
5589360	5590360	They write lots of comics.
5590360	5591360	They have bands.
5591360	5594360	They have radio stations.
5594360	5597360	Yeah, those people just want to be argued with.
5597360	5600360	I, against my parents' wishes when I was like 12 years old,
5600360	5604360	joined in San Diego an evangelist youth group
5604360	5606360	where like at the end of the first meeting they're like,
5606360	5608360	okay, you're new here.
5608360	5610360	Here are a bunch of booklets.
5610360	5612360	It's really, really cool to witness to people.
5612360	5614360	So like just tell us how many people you've witnessed to.
5614360	5616360	And I'm a really competitive person and I was like,
5616360	5618360	okay, is there some sort of game with how many people
5618360	5619360	I could get in heaven?
5619360	5622360	I could get more people into heaven than that guy.
5622360	5625360	And the next week you came back to the youth group
5625360	5627360	and everyone would be like, well, I was in an elevator
5627360	5632360	and I stopped the elevator and I scared a guy,
5632360	5634360	told him we're all going to die,
5634360	5636360	and then I gave him a booklet and I was like,
5636360	5637360	he's going to come to church.
5637360	5641360	Like all these like tricky, tricky stories.
5641360	5645360	And like the dumb joke is, is there an app for that?
5645360	5648360	But then like, but there must be apps for that.
5648360	5651360	There must be like Christian groups making apps
5651360	5655360	for witnessing going, okay, like here, tap this in.
5655360	5658360	Yeah, those people, those people with the signs like don't,
5658360	5660360	the thing that makes me mad about it,
5660360	5662360	like I was brought up Christian and my dad's a preacher
5662360	5665360	and I'm not a practicing Christian, but like I wouldn't know,
5665360	5667360	I don't know anybody ever in the history of my life
5667360	5669360	that would do that stuff.
5669360	5671360	That's obviously about like getting people angry at you.
5671360	5674360	No one walks by a sign that says, you're going to hell.
5674360	5676360	And so I was like, oh, cool.
5676360	5677360	Yeah.
5677360	5679360	You never see him succeeding.
5679360	5682360	There's never, there's never anyone stopping like, yeah, man.
5682360	5684360	It's a weird thing from a logical perspective.
5684360	5686360	If you were an evangelical Christian,
5686360	5691360	why would you go to the place where 60,000 people
5691360	5693360	were doing what they shouldn't do?
5693360	5694360	Why not?
5694360	5696360	Why not go to someplace where there's like 300 people
5696360	5698360	doing the worst thing ever?
5698360	5699360	Go solve murders.
5699360	5700360	Well, they're trying to cure.
5700360	5701360	We caught you.
5701360	5702360	You murdered.
5702360	5703360	Jesus wouldn't do that.
5703360	5705360	And you can actually help the police.
5705360	5707360	Well, they're trying, it's exposure.
5707360	5709360	It's like they're trying to spread disease.
5709360	5710360	They're promoting a product.
5710360	5712360	They're selling a comic book.
5712360	5714360	Yeah, it's that the product is, in their minds,
5714360	5718360	not going to hell, which is a pretty good product to pitch.
5718360	5720360	It's catchy.
5720360	5722360	The one they really believe in.
5722360	5723360	Yeah, that's the thing.
5723360	5726360	It's like, to them, it's literally the most important thing
5726360	5729360	in the universe, which, I mean, if it were true, makes sense.
5729360	5731360	And then when you listen to what they're saying
5731360	5733360	through the bullhards, they sound like the dumbest people
5733360	5735360	in the world, because they're going like,
5735360	5738360	do you believe in a guy with a cape
5738360	5740360	that's going to solve your problem?
5740360	5743360	Everyone's like, no, I don't believe in a guy with a cape.
5743360	5745360	Do you believe in the gospel of Gandalf?
5745360	5746360	I have a job.
5746360	5747360	I work in Verizon.
5747360	5750360	I don't fucking, like, I compartmentalize.
5750360	5752360	Like, are you crazy?
5752360	5754360	I'm spending a lot of money here.
5754360	5756360	I saved up my vacation days.
5756360	5759360	What are you, this isn't fucking Mount Sinai.
5759360	5760360	What do you think I'm doing?
5760360	5762360	Like, I'm dressed as a silon.
5762360	5764360	I'm fucking enjoying myself.
5764360	5769360	I'm doing this instead of rape.
5769360	5771360	I'm doing this instead of murder.
5771360	5773360	I'm doing this instead of ox coveting.
5773360	5775360	I'm doing this instead of theft.
5775360	5777360	I'm doing this instead of almost all ten things
5777360	5779360	your God says I shouldn't do.
5779360	5782360	No, it's not, because it's not real evangelism.
5782360	5783360	It's just, it's kooky.
5783360	5788360	I went to a Miley Cyrus concert a year ago.
5788360	5791360	And in Los Angeles, no need to boo.
5791360	5794360	But I was at this concert and those people were there
5794360	5797360	and then their sides were like, Miley is telling girls
5797360	5799360	to be prostitutes and all these, you know,
5799360	5802360	it's a bunch of 15-year-old girls at this concert
5802360	5806360	were standing on a balcony flashing these guys
5806360	5808360	for hours to the extent that I was like,
5808360	5812360	oh, the way you see young tits is to show the sign
5812360	5814360	at this concert.
5814360	5815360	It was awful.
5815360	5816360	I'm sorry I just said the word tits.
5816360	5817360	I don't ever.
5817360	5818360	You said young tits.
5818360	5820360	That's much more marketable.
5820360	5822360	But also, young tits is a really great name
5822360	5825360	for an all-girl punk band.
5825360	5827360	If anybody needs a bassist, that's all I want to do.
5827360	5831360	A great name for an album or a band or a child.
5831360	5834360	We're giving free copies of our zine, young tits at the door.
5834360	5836360	Toss the refer and young tits.
5836360	5839360	I have one more question about these guys with the signs.
5839360	5843360	Why are they always on the other side of the railroad tracks
5843360	5844360	from the convention center?
5845360	5847360	I would assume that they would have no compunctions
5847360	5850360	about getting right up in the convention center.
5850360	5852360	I think they want to keep it moving the closer.
5852360	5855360	I mean, right outside the Marriott Marquis,
5855360	5856360	there's people.
5856360	5858360	So it's like they are on the periphery.
5858360	5860360	It seems like they're trying to get close.
5860360	5862360	But do you think people are preventing them from being close?
5862360	5865360	I think if they were standing still that whole time,
5865360	5867360	yeah, they'd be able to keep it moving or something.
5867360	5870360	But I did see some folks with their signs
5870360	5873360	right outside the front of the convention center.
5873360	5874360	Yeah, right by the Marriott.
5874360	5877360	They have one badge that they keep swapping.
5877360	5878360	Now UV Kyle.
5878360	5880360	It's sort of weird because I was like,
5880360	5884360	well, what sin do you guys think all these people here
5884360	5885360	are committing?
5885360	5887360	They're starting in the wrong place.
5887360	5892360	Yeah, they start with repent, which is very accusatory.
5892360	5894360	I mean, it's easy target.
5894360	5896360	Some kid that's dressed as poison ivy.
5896360	5897360	It's like, shame on you.
5897360	5898360	You're a terrible person.
5898360	5900360	Well, it doesn't have to be shame.
5900360	5903360	It's like, hey, man, free prizes in heaven.
5903360	5906360	You know, that would work.
5906360	5909360	Get early in line for God.
5909360	5913360	Yeah, there's no waiting in line to get to the kingdom of Lord.
5913360	5916360	Unless I'm mistaken, and I've been coming here,
5916360	5918360	I've seen them like five years in a row.
5918360	5920360	Unless I'm mistaken, that's not the messaging on their advertising.
5920360	5921360	That's what's confusing.
5921360	5923360	They're not saying have a good Comic Con,
5923360	5925360	but get it out of your system,
5925360	5928360	and then we'd like to talk to you about a real superhero.
5928360	5929360	That would be cool.
5929360	5931360	Yeah, that would work.
5931360	5935360	They're saying, congratulations on driving here from Phoenix.
5935360	5937360	Stop right now.
5937360	5940360	Phoenix.
5940360	5943360	Then where is the scriptural basis for their objection?
5943360	5946360	It's like, where in the Bible says...
5946360	5947360	It's not real Christians.
5947360	5949360	Don't dress up in a costume.
5949360	5951360	I'm sure there's some people in this audience who are Christian.
5951360	5953360	Like, that's not anything that you would ever do.
5953360	5954360	Is that a dot?
5954360	5955360	Is that a dot we're connecting to?
5955360	5958360	Why are you worried that Christianity is going to be betrayed by...
5958360	5960360	We're talking about those seven yahoos.
5960360	5961360	We're not talking about Christianity.
5961360	5963360	They're not saying comics are evil.
5963360	5966360	They're saying everyone's going to hell because you're not safe.
5966360	5968360	We're talking about those people.
5968360	5972360	I've never heard one say you're going to hell because of comics.
5972360	5973360	I've never heard them say that.
5973360	5974360	They might, but I've never heard it.
5974360	5977360	Well, I've heard them kind of protest.
5977360	5979360	Comics lead you into witchcraft,
5979360	5984360	and that's the scriptural doctrinal line, right?
5984360	5989360	What I heard when I stopped to listen was actually,
5989360	5995360	they said, you guys are worshipping characters that have superpowers,
5995360	5998360	and Jesus is the only one that should have superpowers.
5998360	6000360	That's old school craziness.
6000360	6003360	And it's sort of like, thou shalt not have any more gods of a long time.
6003360	6004360	Yes, idolatry, yeah.
6004360	6008360	And it's like, wait, are you saying that your god is a story?
6008360	6010360	No, they're saying he's not.
6010360	6013360	And if you make up stories about people that can do magic tricks,
6013360	6016360	the thing of making up stories, we should play some shadow writing.
6016360	6017360	Yeah, I know.
6023360	6026360	The role of Jesus will be played by Spencer Crittenden.
6026360	6030360	Can we pretend my character inhaled a meatball?
6030360	6033360	Also, you never had a drink of that Bloody Mary.
6033360	6034360	You only ate the...
6034360	6035360	I ate the fucking burger.
6035360	6037360	And then it was just one moment where I was like,
6037360	6039360	I just took a breath because I was going to go out
6039360	6041360	and talk to people about their favorite color.
6041360	6045360	And then, goddamn it, it ruined my night.
6045360	6048360	I'm on the recoup now.
6048360	6050360	I can't believe somebody had the terrible instinct
6050360	6053360	of giving me whole bottles when I brought you out on stage.
6054360	6056360	Who wants some? Is that legal?
6057360	6058360	I know it's illegal, but fuck it.
6058360	6061360	Oh, by the way, have we praised this venue?
6061360	6062360	I think Jeff did.
6062360	6063360	Yeah, it is so venerable.
6063360	6064360	The Tin Roof is...
6064360	6067360	The Tin Roof!
6068360	6071360	We booked this place very late in the game,
6071360	6073360	and they were so accommodating,
6073360	6076360	and the room fit us all,
6076360	6079360	and they've been very gracious,
6079360	6081360	and there were four bottles of kettle in the green room,
6081360	6086360	and they're just nice and professional and wonderful.
6086360	6088360	And food on top of that.
6088360	6090360	And hopefully, maybe we can do this thing every year
6090360	6092360	or something for Comic-Con.
6092360	6098360	And thank you to Elizabeth and Steve that were Raptors
6098360	6100360	and are also selling merch over here.
6100360	6102360	It was so cool to say thank you.
6102360	6106360	And let's hear it for the area of the electromagnetic spectrum
6106360	6109360	that you guys cheered the most for, greenish.
6111360	6113360	With a slight nod to purple.
6115360	6118360	You're kind of like those people with signs but with colors.
6118360	6120360	How dare you?
6121360	6124360	If you like something reflecting into your eye,
6124360	6126360	why don't you like purple?
6126360	6128360	Why red?
6129360	6131360	Oh, God, this is how we die.
6131360	6133360	Oh, no, it's okay, sorry.
6133360	6135360	If you really believe in this color,
6135360	6139360	can you hold up something that is that color?
6139360	6140360	What?
6140360	6141360	Right.
6141360	6143360	Is your favorite color, do you wear that color?
6143360	6144360	My favorite color is red.
6144360	6145360	Really? Prove it.
6145360	6146360	Show me something red.
6146360	6148360	Are we tracking to this and how we solved this?
6148360	6149360	We didn't solve it.
6149360	6151360	Colors are dumb and having a favorite one is dumb.
6151360	6152360	Fair enough.
6157360	6160360	You have a favorite food that doesn't mean you necessarily eat it all the time
6160360	6161360	or a favorite movie.
6161360	6165360	If you're talking about macaroni and cheese, that is what it means.
6167360	6171360	You could shoot me into space in a bowl of macaroni and cheese
6171360	6173360	and I would never go, where's the pizza?
6173360	6176360	I think the more important thing is like exploring
6176360	6179360	why you're so angry that people have a favorite thing
6179360	6180360	that you don't understand.
6180360	6182360	Because I am autistic.
6184360	6185360	There we go.
6186360	6187360	It's not easy.
6188360	6190360	No, no, come on, come on, come on.
6191360	6192360	Are you gonna play your shot?
6192360	6195360	Are you so angry that people have a favorite thing?
6195360	6196360	I think they're lying.
6196360	6197360	It doesn't make any sense.
6197360	6198360	It doesn't mean anything.
6198360	6200360	Also, you hate color as a principle.
6200360	6202360	You said you don't like colors.
6203360	6205360	He hates colors because I love colors.
6205360	6206360	I do that to upset Aaron.
6206360	6208360	He does it to make me sad.
6209360	6212360	But the truth is you can get all important information
6212360	6214360	out of a black and white image.
6214360	6217360	Right, but I don't do that to you about things that you love.
6217360	6218360	Like what?
6218360	6219360	What if you tried?
6219360	6220360	What would...
6222360	6223360	Let's play Shadow Run.
6223360	6224360	This is boring.
6224360	6225360	I wanna play Shadow Run.
6225360	6227360	Yeah!
6227360	6228360	Hit the gas pedal.
6228360	6230360	Shadow Run!
6233360	6234360	Shadow Run.
6235360	6238360	Alright, so what character is Steven playing?
6238360	6240360	Should it be Doctor Friend probably?
6240360	6243360	You know, let the dice fall where they may.
6243360	6245360	Do you follow the show at all, Steven?
6245360	6246360	Do you know...
6246360	6247360	He's a huge fan.
6247360	6248360	I would say...
6248360	6251360	I would pitch that Steven should be Doctor Friend, right?
6251360	6253360	I don't care.
6253360	6258360	You're a troll doctor who does no harm,
6258360	6261360	but also is a very complicated fellow.
6262360	6265360	And so, do we have an extra?
6265360	6267360	Yeah, we have a D'Mourj, but...
6267360	6271360	We have a D'Mourj who plays Hertzhold.
6274360	6276360	This guy's got a lot of friends pointing at him,
6276360	6277360	so I guess we'll use him.
6283360	6285360	Yeah, no, over here, man.
6285360	6286360	Come up.
6286360	6289360	Oh yeah, yeah, sit here and use that mic.
6289360	6291360	No, stand behind that beam.
6291360	6293360	Earlier, I came to this venue at 4 p.m.
6293360	6295360	and all the great people who work here were like,
6295360	6296360	okay, so you're banned?
6296360	6297360	They put their equipment on.
6297360	6299360	I'm like, oh no, it's a comedy show.
6299360	6302360	And they're like, yeah, we don't really understand what it is.
6302360	6304360	We've got mixed things.
6304360	6306360	And then cut to this moment where we're passing out folders
6306360	6308360	and we're like, no, really not a banned.
6308360	6310360	Super not a banned.
6310360	6312360	Did I hear your friends calling you Gobot?
6312360	6314360	No, it's Craig Knight.
6314360	6316360	Craig Knight, sounds the same.
6316360	6317360	You can call me Gobot, I don't care.
6317360	6318360	Alright, Gobot.
6318360	6320360	Oh, thanks, Dan.
6320360	6321360	Trying to catch up quickly, though.
6321360	6323360	I'm not seeing alignment anywhere.
6323360	6326360	Oh yeah, Shadowrun doesn't have alignment.
6326360	6327360	Oh, damn, okay.
6327360	6328360	This is in D&D, my friend.
6328360	6329360	Come on.
6329360	6332360	It's a lot darker shades than that.
6332360	6335360	Do we have a guest, a guest intro person?
6335360	6338360	Yeah, a guest known only as Diego.
6338360	6340360	Diego, I love it.
6342360	6345360	He's the saint of the city we're in.
6345360	6347360	Shall we rock and roll?
6348360	6350360	Yeah, yeah, let's rock and roll.
6350360	6352360	Here we go.
6353360	6355360	Oh, yeah.
6360360	6363360	Last time on Harmon, Town Shadowrun.
6363360	6366360	Facing the ethical dilemma posed by Jesse Yellowman,
6366360	6370360	our Shadowrunners decided to look into Baldwin Brown's research
6370360	6372360	on BTL chips for themselves.
6372360	6376360	Hordegard insisted the files shouldn't be sent over the Matrix
6376360	6379360	and stuffed a tied-up and twisted Jesse Yellowman
6379360	6381360	into the back of their Uber.
6381360	6384360	Joined by Hakai at Hank's Last Stand, Mercy, Eve,
6384360	6387360	and Hordegard uncovered the research,
6387360	6390360	showing that BTL chips can be used without addiction
6390360	6392360	or harmful effects.
6392360	6395360	Meanwhile, Jim Nightblade discovered Dr. Friend's
6395360	6398360	increasingly hard feelings for his fellow.
6398360	6401360	Will Dr. Friend's emotions go unrequited?
6401360	6404360	Can Jim Nightblade keep the trolls' secrets safe
6404360	6408360	in a world where comm links always seem to be on?
6408360	6411360	Will Dr. Friend find agency in a world of hackers
6411360	6416360	hooked on mountains of robo-cocaine with no consequences?
6416360	6421360	We find out now on Harmon Town Shadow Town Harmon Run Comic-Con Edition.
6426360	6428360	Diego.
6430360	6431360	Alright, so where are we?
6431360	6432360	Yeah, thanks, Diego.
6432360	6435360	So you're back at Hank's Last Stand.
6435360	6440360	Jesse Yellowman is trapped in the trunk of your Uber,
6440360	6442360	which is idling outside.
6442360	6444360	You are paying for that.
6444360	6446360	It's reasonable, though.
6446360	6450360	So you're in Hank's Last Stand.
6450360	6452360	Hakai just revealed the data.
6452360	6456360	It's about curing the ill effects of BTL chip use.
6456360	6459360	And that's what that data you were searching for was.
6459360	6462360	You still have it in your possession. You haven't turned it in yet.
6462360	6465360	And that's what Baldwin Brown wants?
6465360	6469360	That's what Baldwin Brown had, and he would like it, yeah.
6469360	6473360	And we were wondering, do they want that information because they want to suppress it?
6473360	6476360	Because they could make BTL chips healthy?
6476360	6480360	Or do they want it so they could just sell a bunch of BTL chips?
6480360	6482360	Or a different option.
6482360	6484360	Uh-oh. Oh, shit.
6484360	6486360	Oh, no.
6487360	6495360	As a doctor, I say we vivisect him and just get what we can.
6495360	6497360	Vivisect who, doctor?
6497360	6501360	Our tied up dude in the back of our car.
6501360	6505360	You want to vivisect Jesse Yellowman, the guy tied up in the trunk of the Uber right now?
6505360	6506360	Yes.
6506360	6510360	That seems like a very straightforward thing that a doctor would want to do.
6510360	6514360	But what would the vivisection yield from him?
6514360	6515360	Secrets?
6516360	6517360	Okay.
6517360	6519360	Let's put a pin in that.
6519360	6521360	Fair? Fair?
6522360	6524360	Hey, HackEye.
6524360	6525360	Yeah.
6525360	6529360	What do you think a third possibility would be?
6529360	6530360	Oh, man.
6530360	6533360	Well, what are the first two possibilities?
6533360	6537360	That are Johnson's, is that what they're called?
6537360	6538360	Sure, yes.
6538360	6539360	I'm sorry.
6539360	6540360	That are Johnson's.
6540360	6542360	They mean good or they're trying to suppress it?
6542360	6547360	They want to make BTL chips healthier for everybody and sell a bunch of them?
6547360	6551360	Or that they want to take the information and destroy it, like the tobacco companies?
6551360	6553360	Those are two options.
6553360	6555360	Possible third, they don't want to use it.
6555360	6557360	They just want to sell it for higher value.
6557360	6559360	Sell the information?
6559360	6560360	Yeah.
6560360	6563360	Fourth reason, maybe they know something we don't.
6563360	6570360	Maybe they think that BTL chips aren't addictive enough or are too addictive and want to change the nature of it.
6570360	6576360	Maybe they're staging an all out drug war and hope that clamping down on this.
6576360	6577360	Who knows, man?
6577360	6580360	If the corpse are involved, who knows?
6580360	6581360	HackEye.
6581360	6582360	You just got to get in there yourselves.
6582360	6584360	HackEye, which corporation makes the BTL chips?
6584360	6585360	Do we know that?
6585360	6586360	Oh, man.
6586360	6587360	Everyone makes BTL chips.
6587360	6591360	You could just make them, if you have one of your nano forges, you know, you can print them out at home.
6591360	6593360	You can also just download them on iTunes.
6593360	6595360	Why aren't we just making our own?
6595360	6598360	Is there anybody currently trying to kill us right now?
6598360	6601360	Not at this moment that I am aware of.
6601360	6603360	What do you think, Hordegard?
6603360	6605360	See, I'm a dwarf.
6605360	6609360	I think we should hack into the matrix, because that's what I was told in the synopsis.
6609360	6610360	Jesus Christ.
6610360	6613360	All right.
6613360	6615360	Go bot.
6615360	6622360	Well, you know, it seems like, I know I keep going back and forth on this, but like, I don't know.
6622360	6624360	We fucking, we're Shadowrun.
6624360	6626360	We work for evil corporations.
6626360	6627360	We're Shadowrun.
6627360	6628360	We're a group.
6628360	6630360	We're more than a group.
6630360	6631360	Come on now.
6631360	6632360	We're a team.
6632360	6634360	And we know each other.
6634360	6636360	We've worked together so much.
6636360	6642360	It's time for us to get together and then look to our leader.
6642360	6646360	I think, I feel like I keep, I keep, what?
6646360	6647360	Rescue him.
6647360	6648360	Rescue him.
6648360	6649360	He's in the trunk.
6649360	6651360	Everyone's a dipshit tonight.
6651360	6652360	He's the element in the trunk.
6652360	6654360	Oh, rescue him from, yeah, but.
6654360	6655360	Just open the trunk, dude.
6655360	6660360	But if every mission we go on, I know I said the opposite last time, but, Jesus Christ,
6660360	6661360	I'm really conflicted.
6661360	6662360	Spencer, table talk.
6662360	6665360	Is, is Baldwin Brown with us in the bar right now?
6665360	6668360	No, Baldwin Brown is at the place you delivered him to.
6668360	6669360	Why don't we?
6669360	6672360	I'm just, can we vivify somebody?
6672360	6674360	We got to do that later.
6674360	6676360	I'll offer myself.
6676360	6678360	Just for interest.
6678360	6681360	I order a drink from the bar.
6681360	6684360	So, so Baldwin Brown's not at the bar we're at.
6684360	6685360	Wait, what do you order?
6685360	6699360	I order a, a, a, I order a, I order a, a scotch on a rock, a single rock.
6699360	6700360	All right.
6700360	6703360	It arrives.
6703360	6704360	Thank you.
6704360	6706360	What's, what's your story?
6706360	6708360	I'm Hank.
6709360	6713360	My story is that I always wanted to own a bar, and then I did.
6713360	6717360	And then all this future crazy dystopia shit happened.
6717360	6720360	And now my bar is in a terrible part of town.
6720360	6725360	So I pretty much only cater to outlaws and ne'er-do-wells.
6725360	6732360	Boy, Hank, I'm just, first of all, I love the name Hank.
6732360	6736360	Hank, you must see a lot of shady stuff.
6736360	6737360	Oh yeah.
6737360	6742360	But, you know, I don't like mentioning it because that'll get us all killed.
6742360	6744360	So put it back in your pants.
6744360	6749360	Can we get gun on with the, the, I say, okay, I'm in the, this is the mood I'm in.
6749360	6753360	I'm sorry, was my ordering a drink worse than vivisecting the person in the truck?
6753360	6757360	No, there's no competent, if you're competing with him, you're in a fucked up place.
6757360	6759360	That we both, that everyone is lost.
6759360	6761360	So you can't hear me here in the car?
6761360	6764360	I'm standing here with my ear to your mouth.
6764360	6765360	You don't know that.
6766360	6773360	I say we take yellow Pinkerman and we take him to the Johnson.
6773360	6776360	We give him everything and we fucking walk away.
6776360	6777360	With a big score.
6777360	6778360	We're shadow runners.
6778360	6779360	How about that?
6779360	6781360	You know, I gotta like that.
6781360	6787360	Nightblade, I say we do that and we walk away unless the washer hands of this whole show.
6787360	6789360	And go on our next shadow runner.
6789360	6792360	Because I don't think there'll be any repercussions.
6792360	6794360	I don't think this will be a cliffhanger.
6794360	6797360	I don't think this will ever come back to haunt us.
6797360	6799360	I think we just do our job.
6799360	6800360	Get paid.
6800360	6804360	Get paid and mow money and I mow problems.
6805360	6807360	All right, let's do it.
6807360	6808360	Let's get back in the Uber.
6808360	6811360	Let's take our bounty back to the thing.
6811360	6812360	We'll probably get a bonus.
6812360	6813360	Of course.
6813360	6818360	I mean, Mercy, when we get there, negotiate the fuck out of this and give us some extra money on this one.
6818360	6819360	Yeah, yeah, I'm revving up.
6819360	6820360	All right.
6820360	6821360	All on the Uber.
6821360	6822360	Everyone in.
6822360	6823360	We got everybody?
6823360	6824360	Everybody.
6824360	6827360	There we go.
6827360	6828360	Yeah.
6828360	6829360	Yeah.
6829360	6830360	Yeah.
6830360	6831360	Yeah.
6831360	6832360	Yeah.
6832360	6833360	Yeah.
6833360	6834360	Yeah.
6834360	6835360	Yeah.
6835360	6836360	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6836360	6838360	You're at the neutral drop zone.
6838360	6839360	Animation.
6839360	6842360	So you're at the neutral drop zone.
6842360	6847360	The same place where you delivered Baldwin Brown to his truck bound captors.
6847360	6852360	It's an old, old truck lot in a shitty part of town across from all sorts of devastated warehouse.
6852360	6856360	And broken down clinics and all sorts of buildings that used to house stuff.
6856360	6863360	And now only mostly house monsters and ghouls and all sorts of uncouth shit.
6863360	6865360	So there you are.
6865360	6869360	You pull into the parking lot, which is the neutral drop zone.
6869360	6878360	And once again, you see a trollish businessman, an orcish businessman in a business suit sitting in a semi truck.
6878360	6882360	The lights turn on and he exits the truck and walks over to you guys.
6882360	6884360	Very do all the talking.
6884360	6885360	Okay.
6885360	6886360	Foot, foot, foot, foot.
6886360	6889360	That's how I walk.
6889360	6890360	Hi.
6890360	6893360	Hey there.
6893360	6894360	Hello.
6894360	6895360	Here.
6895360	6896360	I'm sorry.
6896360	6897360	Hold on one second.
6897360	6898360	Okay.
6898360	6899360	I walked back to my crew.
6899360	6900360	What am I doing?
6900360	6905360	Tell him we got the files they wanted and also we got a bonus for him, depending on how much he's willing to pay.
6905360	6907360	But don't tell him he's in the trunk.
6907360	6908360	Okay.
6908360	6909360	Cool.
6909360	6910360	All right.
6910360	6911360	Foot, foot, foot, foot.
6911360	6912360	Hey.
6912360	6913360	Hey.
6913360	6914360	I mean, hey.
6914360	6917360	So I have some files that I know you want.
6917360	6918360	Yes, I do.
6918360	6919360	All right.
6919360	6922360	What are you willing to give me for these files?
6922360	6924360	The agreed upon amount.
6924360	6925360	I don't know.
6925360	6927360	I'm going to send it to you.
6927360	6928360	Okay.
6928360	6929360	Okay.
6929360	6930360	Okay.
6930360	6931360	Okay.
6931360	6932360	Okay.
6932360	6933360	Okay.
6933360	6934360	Okay.
6934360	6935360	Okay.
6935360	6936360	Okay.
6936360	6944360	I'm going to say we went a little bit more because I know a certain someone.
6944360	6945360	Hold on a second.
6945360	6947360	Foot, foot, foot, foot, foot.
6947360	6948360	Wait.
6948360	6949360	What was the name?
6949360	6950360	Jesse Yellowman.
6950360	6951360	Jesse Yellowman.
6951360	6952360	Okay.
6952360	6953360	Foot, foot, foot.
6953360	6954360	Hey.
6954360	6955360	Wait.
6955360	6956360	Foot, foot, foot, foot.
6956360	6958360	The agreed upon price is fine, but we'd like a bonus.
6958360	6959360	Oh, okay.
6959360	6960360	Yeah.
6960360	6961360	I mean, here's the thing.
6961360	6965360	I promise I'm listening, but then I just forget.
6965360	6966360	Sorry.
6966360	6967360	Sorry.
6967360	6968360	Got it.
6968360	6969360	Okay.
6969360	6970360	Okay.
6970360	6971360	All right.
6971360	6972360	Yeah.
6972360	6973360	Yeah.
6973360	6974360	Okay.
6974360	6975360	Foot, foot, foot.
6975360	6976360	I was like, let's just take the money.
6976360	6980440	That amount that you have is great, but you know, we've done an extra great job and similar
6980440	6984720	to when you would go to a fancy restaurant and someone treated you extra special.
6984720	6988480	We just like a little bonus, a little tip, tip.
6988480	6991920	In what way have you done an extra great job?
6991920	6994920	Well, we can't reveal that.
6994920	6995920	Oh.
6995920	6999920	I use, I use a, oh, I have a jammer.
6999920	7000920	Okay.
7000920	7001920	Anyway.
7001920	7002920	Yeah.
7002920	7004440	No, I use, I use my power.
7004440	7011080	I use con and negotiation or I use negotiation.
7011080	7012600	Okay.
7012600	7017000	Look, we know where Jesse Yellowman is.
7017000	7018000	Yeah.
7018000	7019000	Yellowman is.
7019000	7020000	Right.
7020000	7021000	Yeah.
7021000	7022000	I mean, obviously it's Jesse Pinkman.
7022000	7023000	We were dancing around this, right?
7023000	7024000	Okay.
7024080	7025080	Sorry.
7025080	7026080	Sorry.
7026080	7027080	Sorry.
7027080	7028080	Sorry.
7028080	7029080	Sorry.
7029080	7030080	Sorry.
7030080	7031080	We, we know where Jesse Yellowman is.
7031080	7032080	Who's that?
7032080	7035200	Well, he's someone who's very valuable to you.
7035200	7036200	I'm using negotiation.
7036200	7046840	He's someone who's very, very important to your operation and we just want, it's apparently
7046840	7056840	9-11 and our, and our corrupted audience now celebrates it on their own.
7056840	7057840	It's the Roshima Club.
7057840	7068720	For the most important date in all of our history and old Lang Syne.
7068720	7069720	Okay.
7069720	7071720	We did it.
7071720	7074840	Look, we want to, hold on a second.
7074840	7075840	Foot, foot, foot, foot.
7075840	7076840	It's just kind of a bonus.
7076840	7079840	I just, well, just whatever they, I mean, it's just an emotional bonus.
7079840	7080840	Do we need this?
7080840	7081840	No, we need this.
7081840	7082840	No, we don't.
7082840	7083840	Can we actually close the deal?
7083840	7084840	Wrap up this, this thing?
7084840	7089840	It's a guy you have like, you have like, throw a couple, a couple extra clams our way.
7089840	7090840	Okay.
7090840	7091840	Let's see if he says yes.
7091840	7092840	And it's a guy.
7092840	7093840	Okay.
7093840	7095840	It's a guy that Billy Baldwin cares about.
7095840	7096840	Right.
7096840	7097840	Right.
7097840	7098840	Okay.
7098840	7099840	Foot, foot, foot, foot.
7099840	7102560	Look, we just want a little extra money.
7102560	7103560	You're good people.
7103560	7104840	We're good people.
7104840	7106040	Let's do this.
7106040	7111360	Just throw us some money and this will all make sense.
7111360	7120880	We know a young man who Mr. BB is very crazy about and we know where he is and it would
7120880	7125200	be in your best interest to just throw us, throw us some money and we'll shake hands
7125200	7128280	and look at these eyes.
7128280	7129560	That sounds.
7129560	7134680	And tell him that we have a secret that he might want to give us a little bit more.
7134680	7137440	You don't think that that was implied in what I said?
7137440	7138440	Another secret.
7138440	7139440	Okay.
7139440	7140440	Also we have another secret.
7140440	7149040	Well, that just seems excessive, but just to throw it on the pile, but secrets, you
7149040	7157840	know, six, six secrets per a hundred gold coins, your secret metric is off.
7157840	7161440	Uh, I, um, yeah, we have another secret.
7161440	7164200	Also I have some secrets.
7164200	7165200	Jesus Christ.
7165200	7168600	Just what do you say?
7168600	7174920	I say 15% more than the originally agreed upon price.
7174920	7176920	Thank you.
7176920	7179680	We did it.
7179680	7180680	We did it.
7180680	7183440	She drives a hard bargain.
7183440	7185240	Where is this fellow?
7185240	7190520	Uh, he's, we're, um, well, wait here.
7190520	7191520	Okay.
7191520	7192520	Turn around.
7192520	7193520	Okay.
7193520	7194520	We're going to face the other way.
7194520	7195520	That's the way we do things.
7195520	7196520	It's our signature.
7196520	7197520	It's totally fine.
7197520	7198520	Don't attack me.
7198520	7199520	No, no, of course not.
7199520	7200520	Of course not.
7200520	7201880	I haven't given you money.
7201880	7205840	I say it when he turns around, we all take our pants down and when he turns around, we
7205840	7208880	just go, we're just fucking with you.
7208880	7216760	I open the trunk of the Uber, uh, just the element pops out blinking in the evening light.
7216760	7218760	Surprise.
7218760	7226480	Uh, I, I haul him over to the, to the, to the Johnson and I pull, I pulled, uh, Jesse
7226480	7232800	element by the collar and I lean and I say, look, you tell them that you were in the trunk.
7232800	7234320	Bad things are going to happen to you.
7234320	7235960	It doesn't matter now.
7235960	7240440	That's the, that's the only point of that is just so they don't just let me follow my
7240440	7241440	own bliss.
7241440	7244280	I just wanted to do that.
7244280	7245800	I'm not a very strong person.
7245800	7247800	I'm just a talker.
7248800	7255480	Bad things will happen to you when I say goodbye.
7255480	7261800	I feel like bad things will happen to me now that I'm being sold to a businessman.
7261800	7265120	Baby, baby, baby.
7265120	7266800	Don't think of it that way.
7266800	7267800	Okay.
7267800	7271000	Look, at any given time, we're all commerce.
7271000	7272000	We're all bartered.
7272000	7276340	It's, it's, you know, it's life, you know, it's.
7276340	7279540	So what are you guys going to do with, uh, these files?
7279540	7283580	Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna put them to good use.
7283580	7288340	We've got big designs for our new sales force.
7288340	7290980	Do you guys want to go bowling?
7290980	7293940	Did we get paid?
7293940	7294940	I'm never bowling.
7294940	7295940	I do.
7295940	7296940	I say we do it.
7296940	7297940	Wait.
7297940	7298940	You've never bowled?
7298940	7300940	No, I've bowled before.
7300940	7302940	Oh, why did you say you had never bowled?
7302940	7303940	No, I said I'm down to bowl.
7303940	7304940	Oh, you're down to.
7304940	7305940	I'm so sorry.
7305940	7306940	No, it's cool.
7306940	7307940	It's cool bowling.
7307940	7308940	Yeah.
7308940	7309940	Can we get paid?
7309940	7312820	Well, you seem to be occupied in other tasks.
7312820	7315220	Oh, no, we haven't been paid yet.
7315220	7317660	You said, you said 50% on top of.
7317660	7318660	I did not.
7318660	7320740	I said 15.
7320740	7321740	Very explicitly.
7321740	7322740	All right.
7322740	7326980	I, I put out, I put out my hand to accept the appropriate amount of payment.
7326980	7333140	He shoves a large silver briefcase heavy with bills into your hands.
7333140	7335140	What paper money?
7335940	7339340	Are you effing serious?
7339340	7340340	Oh, shit.
7340340	7341340	Dr. Friend.
7341340	7342340	Dr. Friend, it's cool.
7342340	7343340	It's cool.
7343340	7344340	It's money.
7344340	7349340	This is the wrong time to be on your weird paper money thing.
7349340	7354540	But I tell you the death of the use of paper money will be the death of the feudal system
7354540	7357740	that we all rely upon.
7357740	7363980	After handing you the suitcase, the Johnson pulls out a pistol and shoots Jesse Yellowman
7363980	7364980	in the face.
7364980	7365980	Oh, shit.
7365980	7366980	Oh, shit.
7366980	7374980	I guess we had to know that was a possibility.
7374980	7380580	I think, I think that blood is literally on our hands and faces.
7380580	7381580	Yeah.
7381580	7383980	It's all over pants.
7383980	7385980	Nice doing business with you.
7385980	7388900	I've got a truck stop to attend.
7388900	7390340	He pulls into his truck.
7390340	7392460	That was worth 15%.
7393460	7394460	Jesus.
7394460	7400060	You are cold, our NPC contact in this adventure.
7400060	7401860	You are a very cool person.
7401860	7402860	Yes.
7402860	7403860	Yes.
7403860	7405620	So, so he leaves.
7405620	7407940	We're all splattered with Jesse Yellowman's blood.
7407940	7408940	Yep.
7408940	7409940	We're at Hank's last stand.
7409940	7412340	And you hear the suitcase start to beep.
7412340	7413340	Uh-oh.
7413340	7414340	Oh, shit.
7414340	7417340	Now I really need a drink.
7417340	7418340	Cliffhanger!
7418340	7419340	What?
7419340	7420340	That's...
7421220	7424220	Steven Natalie, everybody.
7424220	7427220	Aaron McGathey.
7427220	7429220	What's that guy's name?
7429220	7431220	Who the fuck is that guy?
7431220	7433220	Thank you very much.
7433220	7434220	What?
7434220	7437220	Oh, what's that guy?
7437220	7438220	Craig.
7438220	7439220	Craig?
7439220	7440220	It's Craig Knight.
7440220	7441220	Craig Knight.
7441220	7442220	Fuck it.
7442220	7445220	Spencer Crichton, everybody.
7446220	7447220	I'm Jeff Davis.
7447220	7449220	Your mayor is Dan Harmon.
7454220	7458220	This show brought to you by whoever gave me this Bible of Phonette Bronco.
7460220	7461220	All right, San Diego.
7461220	7462220	Drive fast.
7462220	7463220	Take chances.
7476220	7478220	Did you get any of that?
7479220	7481220	It's a good show.
