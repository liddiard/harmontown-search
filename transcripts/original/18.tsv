0	15600	Ladies and gentlemen, Harman Town is now in session.
15600	21000	Oh, yes indeed.
21000	25240	Welcome you lucky sons of bitches to the Nerd Mel Theater in Hollywood, California.
26240	31240	And you send me lucky people listening on your, whatever the fuck you listen to things on.
31240	41240	Please welcome the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
41240	47240	Thank you very much.
47240	51240	Okay, so this may get weird tonight.
51240	58240	I didn't have anything and so I went through my office at home and I found this journal I wrote in high school.
58240	63240	And that's something that LA people do a lot at special shows and things.
63240	67240	You know, it's a, you know, you read your embarrassing adolescent journals and stuff.
67240	68240	I thought, oh, that's ducks in a barrel.
68240	73240	It'd be like, you know, oh, Dan the Nerd, like being a nerd and trying to be cool,
73240	78240	but being a nerd, trying to be a good writer, being a bad writer, and I'll mock my teenage self
78240	84240	and we'll, you know, the unspoken humblebrag headline will be, I'm so much cooler now.
84240	88240	Which is how I think it usually works when you read these things.
88240	92240	I started reading it and I got really bummed out.
92240	98240	Just devastated.
98240	105240	I want to say I was a vile person, but I mean, it's just, I don't see the difference between this kid and myself.
106240	114240	And except that I just, I stopped trying to talk like Frasier all the time, which this kid at 15 is still doing.
114240	119240	And I also just stopped trying to impress other people, including myself.
119240	120240	I got to stop posturing.
120240	123240	So it's just, I don't know.
123240	125240	I don't know what it is.
125240	128240	Aaron was like, oh, this is very, I mean, this is all what's interesting.
128240	133240	And people that do those journal shows, Aaron said, they always read the wrong entries.
133240	135240	They always, you know, because they don't get it.
135240	140240	They don't understand what about their entries is, you know, is what we want to hear.
140240	143240	You know, the Schadenfreude at all or whatever it is.
143240	145240	You're holding a spiral.
145240	147240	With 27 post-it notes.
147240	151240	Because I started marking once, oh, I'll just read this and then I'll read that.
151240	153240	I want to paint the picture for people listening to this.
153240	158240	This is not like a little, you know, like a little velvet case, you know, like diary.
158240	162240	It's a standard spiral notebook.
162240	164240	How many of these did you have?
164240	165240	I found two of them.
165240	166240	This is the first one.
166240	168240	I was obsessed with transitions.
168240	170240	So there's a lot of chapters that happened to this.
170240	174240	And I bring the journal to a conclusion at 17.
174240	175240	I go, I'm done.
175240	178240	There's nothing more to say.
178240	181240	I'm self-actualized.
181240	186240	The title is Sand Pollution, the journals of Dan Harmon.
186240	189240	November 1989 to September 1990.
189240	190240	Sand pollution?
190240	193240	Yes, I'm glad you asked.
193240	199240	I'll give you a taste of my voice at 15.
199240	202240	This is how I ended the first entry.
202240	203240	I won't bother to.
203240	205240	I mean, maybe I'll start.
205240	208240	November 27, 1989, 10.30 p.m.
208240	216240	A picture of me on like a bear mattress surrounded by just like probably just a lot of my own cum.
217240	222240	I seem to recall not being able to stop touching myself physically or mentally
222240	226240	because no one else was going to do either job.
226240	234240	There's a student with acne and I had a yin-yang patch on my acid watch denim jacket sleeve
234240	240240	because I was very into like Taoism and like exploring all religions and stuff.
240240	243240	I think that for the first time, I'm going to try not to read it in this voice
243240	250240	because I don't want to like, I'm just going to like, just, this hurts really bad
250240	258240	but I'm not going to, if you catch me starting to go like this to make fun of myself, stop me.
258240	265240	I think that for the first time in my life, I consciously realized something today.
265240	270240	November 27th comes and goes with each identical year.
270240	277240	But today was the first and last, 11-27-89 I would ever experience.
277240	281240	Absolutely nothing extraordinary happened today.
281240	286240	The day itself along with every other individual day of the year is gone now forever.
286240	289240	And it took all this time to get that far.
289240	292240	I suppose that's what an optimist or a reborn Christian is.
292240	296240	Someone who can appreciate every day as the only one of its kind and every person is something unrepeatable.
296240	306240	But I feel this renewed vision could only last so long before slowly decomposing whilst laying in...
306240	307240	Wow.
307240	310240	Whilst laying in bitter weight for a replacement philosophy.
310240	317240	I am an agnostic and I realize that philosophy is in the truest sense food for thought.
317240	319240	Hanging on to one bit for too long is silly.
319240	320240	It rots on the shelf.
320240	321240	It begins to stink.
321240	322240	No one gets to enjoy it.
322240	326240	You must consume philosophy, perhaps after brief appreciation.
326240	327240	And how do you consume it?
327240	331240	By bringing out its opposite and exposing it as just more sand.
331240	332240	It's a theme that's coming.
332240	334240	It'll be slowly revealed to you.
334240	335240	Okay.
335240	339240	It's sad in a way, I guess, but the alternatives are unhealthy.
339240	343240	I guess after averaging out all recollection, I'd have to give this day a solid five.
343240	346240	I admit it right now.
346240	347240	I'll give each day a number.
347240	348240	Can I stop right there?
348240	349240	Sure.
349240	350240	But we'll never get anywhere.
350240	352240	Whatever you think, whatever you want to say.
352240	353240	15.
353240	354240	Pretty good for 15.
354240	356240	Maybe that's what I wanted you to think.
356240	359240	Well, so far, I'm on your side.
359240	360240	Sure.
360240	364240	That's probably what I thought the first entry of a journal should accomplish.
364240	368240	And yet, I don't know if I think anyone's ever going to read this.
368240	373240	But I know that I'm trying to impress myself or some unseen reader.
373240	375240	Blogging hasn't been invented yet.
375240	379240	So I'm doing a MySpace blog.
379240	382240	So this is me signing off, and this is very typical.
382240	385240	I won't read all the ones that are kind of typical like this.
385240	387240	This is one of my sign-offs.
387240	389240	Well, deep...
389240	393240	Well, deep...
393240	395240	I have to do the voice.
395240	398240	Well, deep...
398240	399240	Deep night...
399240	401240	Is it night or might?
401240	402240	No, no.
402240	406240	Deep night and weariness, whisper warnings of a melancholy morrow.
406240	410240	All right, I take it all back.
410240	411240	You lost me.
411240	415240	I look upon it with the usual neutral dread.
415240	420240	Max, dear sir, be with me from six till six on the special 28th,
420240	423240	for I predict it will be an ugly irksome four.
423240	429240	Is that written by Doug Kafka?
429240	431240	You should be asking, who's Max?
431240	435240	Well, I have a lot of questions, but let's start with that one.
435240	439240	Max, I figured out, because I was like, who's Max?
439240	440240	Is he the Sand Master?
440240	445240	Do you remember when I told you that, in a way, yes.
445240	448240	Do you remember when I told you that my Dungeons and Dragons character,
448240	451240	you kind of pressed me to tell you, and I said it was Jim Nightblade.
451240	455240	Thank you for calling out from the audience.
455240	456240	That's partly true.
456240	460240	Jim Nightblade was a character I played in a game called Shadowrun.
460240	462240	Nice.
462240	468240	Never let it be said that I did not find my crowd before I died.
468240	471240	You cannot expect more than one woo for Shadowrun,
471240	474240	but if you get one, you have found your niche, sir.
474240	477240	Well, deep weariness and a weary morrow.
477240	479240	Was that a role-playing game?
479240	480240	It was a role-playing game.
480240	483240	It was like, you know, set in the future,
483240	489240	set in a future in which magic and technology had both awakened.
489240	493240	Magic had reawakened, and so there were like ogres and dragons and stuff,
493240	497240	but there were also like hackers and cyber things.
497240	501240	And I played Jim Nightblade, a bounty hunter who, you know,
501240	505240	was killing it with the ladies.
505240	512240	So my point being that I found a thing where I rattled off like all of my...
512240	515240	I was talking about role-playing, and I suddenly realized who Max was.
515240	521240	Max was one of my... was my favorite actual D&D character.
521240	525240	Actually, he was the one I played in a game called Middle Earth Role-Playing,
525240	529240	which was a little cooler than D&D.
529240	537240	It was sort of a crack to D&D's weed, cocaine, I don't know.
537240	540240	And if you ever want a musical cue, I don't know what it is,
540240	542240	but Zach has cued up some of his hip-hop.
542240	546240	So if you ever want it, I don't know what it is.
546240	548240	It's sight unseen or ear unheard.
548240	552240	Well, when your cheeks get to a maximum redness,
552240	557240	feel free to pop the champagne crack with a little brief hip-hop interlude.
557240	561240	December 12, 1989, 10.40 p.m.
561240	567240	Tomorrow, if one thing goes right, I shall have opportunity to partake
567240	571240	in a shadow run with Neil and Rob.
571240	579240	Ah, Seattle in the year 2050.
579240	581240	Your coffee is so strong.
581240	588240	Such a pleasant place to escape to, where prepositions can end sentences.
588240	591240	All right, take it easy, Harmon, don't bully anybody.
591240	595240	Where Jim Nightblade, bounty hunter, stalks the dark streets without fear,
595240	598240	the cybernetically enhanced anti-hero for whom nothing goes wrong
598240	601240	that can't be fixed by next gaming session.
601240	605240	How I envy thee, James.
605240	610240	And how I long to control you again for an hour or two.
610240	613240	And how I wonder why language hasn't evolved
613240	617240	when technology has these and those.
617240	620240	Oh, I wonder that when one writes in a journal,
620240	624240	one must take on an Orson Willian bravado,
624240	628240	although one is writing about one's acne.
628240	631240	So that for one brief moment I might mistake myself for you
631240	633240	and this world for yours.
633240	637240	Also, so that I might add to my treasure chest of fantastic experiences,
637240	642240	which I share with myself alone after the game has been done for days.
642240	646240	You see, reader, there's a reader.
646240	650240	Jim's world has perfect screenplay potential.
651240	655240	I lament earlier that life has no screenplay potential.
660240	662240	This is one day earlier.
662240	665240	I don't even know what to write, but I feel a surge of pathetic feelings.
665240	668240	I know that in a matter of hours something will go wrong or right,
668240	672240	and for the rest of my life some things will just keep going wrong or right.
672240	676240	Real life sucks. It has absolutely no screenplay potential.
676240	679240	Life is a monotonous hairball.
681240	684240	Sorry. My cheeks got red.
685240	688240	Life is a monotonous hairball.
690240	691240	That's all right.
691240	694240	I'm happy then sad, right then wrong.
694240	697240	Wait, let's break down monotonous hairball.
697240	700240	Let's break it down in the metaphor mixer.
704240	705240	Was that it?
705240	707240	Yeah, I don't know.
708240	712240	I'm happy then sad, right then wrong, early then late, old then young.
712240	717240	These drops and peaks are tightly adhered to a steady flatline that is my boring existence.
717240	720240	The problem is, these are normal teenage claims.
722240	724240	But I'm not supposed to be a teenager.
724240	726240	In fact, I'm not. I sense that.
729240	732240	My roots run deeper than any adults.
732240	735240	My branches puncture the farthest layer of sky.
738240	743240	But my roots have yet to drink freely and my leaves have yet to even bud.
743240	745240	Do leaves bud? I don't even know.
750240	756240	So anyways, I talk about going to play the role playing game and then it has perfect screenplay potential.
756240	759240	As does, and this is, I'm going to rattle off names.
759240	764240	These are all names of characters I played, I created and played in various role playing games.
764240	766240	As does Edison newborns,
767240	769240	Melkan Tukes,
770240	771240	Raymond Flinks,
772240	775240	and of course, Maxwell Artfall.
776240	779240	Maxwell Artfall was my big, that was my guy.
779240	780240	Who was here?
780240	783240	He was a bit of a rapscallion, a swashbuckler,
783240	785240	and something of a ladies man.
787240	788240	Strangely enough.
789240	792240	I mean, it gets, it gets dark.
792240	798240	I become, I become more and more of a dick as like my, my sexual frustration kind of like wheels.
798240	802240	When you start writing some of the pros again, I want to, I want to cue that music again.
802240	804240	And I think my timeout is right.
807240	809240	There's a, so I got,
811240	815240	I'll be dipped in dog shit if I didn't pass my road test on Friday.
815240	817240	I'm a licensed driver.
819240	820240	Yeah.
820240	822240	Now that's a real journal entry.
822240	824240	That's a job I'm not doing in every other one.
824240	830240	It's like, why don't you stop telling me about the particulars of the Gestalt and tell me,
830240	834240	remind me at 40 of like, what were you doing?
835240	837240	Gee, the more I write, the less I have to say.
837240	839240	I lost the debate meet on Saturday.
839240	843240	That is Graham and I went two and one, the other team one and two.
843240	845240	I just had to throw them into the bus, I guess.
845240	847240	I didn't go to the snowball dance at school.
847240	850240	I didn't go to the company Christmas party at ground round.
850240	853240	I didn't go to comedy sports on Sunday.
853240	856240	Gina moved in with some guy by UWM.
856240	857240	Gina would be some girl.
857240	858240	I had a crush on that.
858240	861240	Not somebody that ever touched me.
862240	864240	Actually, she let me kiss her under a mistletoe.
864240	866240	You're still 15, right?
866240	868240	This is December 17th in 89.
868240	869240	Yeah, I think I'm 15.
869240	873240	My car insurance shall be costing me about $100 a month.
873240	875240	You had car insurance at 15 years old?
875240	876240	Yeah.
876240	877240	What?
877240	879240	Well, yeah, and a job.
879240	880240	15?
880240	881240	Half my pay at any rate.
881240	882240	I was a dishwasher.
882240	884240	God knows what gasoline costs.
886240	887240	I didn't know yet.
887240	890240	But the funny thing is, these are my only problems.
890240	891240	There are a few more.
891240	894240	I got a C on a Britlet paper, and I'm eight and a half stories behind in that class.
894240	897240	I have to clean my room, no Christmas shopping done,
897240	900240	no girl to spend the remaining 40% of my money on.
902240	904240	Oh, ladies, don't weep for me.
904240	906240	I spew some misogynist shit.
910240	913240	I guess the bottom line is that I need a little excitement
913240	915240	or a little order to my life.
915240	918240	I wish I had a few friends who didn't laugh at everything I said.
921240	922240	No, no, stop laughing.
922240	923240	He hates that.
926240	927240	Yeah, I know.
927240	928240	I come to like it.
929240	933240	But rather had a reply that might silently amuse me.
935240	937240	I wish my zits would vanish,
937240	939240	granting me the confidence I feel I need
939240	942240	to be more successful with the chickers.
949240	950240	Keep going.
953240	954240	He goes on and on.
954240	955240	Oh, shit.
955240	957240	So then there's a page that says,
957240	961240	December 18th through January 3rd, transitional movement.
962240	964240	Phase two begins.
965240	966240	You ready?
966240	967240	You want the music back?
968240	970240	Gants taking off his jacket,
971240	974240	picks up his vodka, and reads.
992240	993240	Phase two, I say.
994240	995240	Fuck it.
996240	999240	In reference to the dealings of my phase one self.
1001240	1002240	Fuck, fuck, fuck it.
1003240	1006240	In fact, I'm afraid the new policy is this.
1007240	1008240	One.
1009240	1011240	No more involvement in the affairs of others.
1013240	1017240	No extracurricular attempts at hobnobbing.
1018240	1023240	Speak when spoken to and when wit is unavoidable.
1026240	1029240	You know, sometimes you don't know your own strength.
1030240	1031240	Number two.
1031240	1033240	Think before speaking.
1033240	1037240	No reflexive speech that wears a groove in your brain.
1037240	1041240	Like, uh, uh, uh, uh, which I grew into the master of.
1041240	1043240	Should have listened to some of this shit.
1043240	1044240	Number three.
1044240	1046240	No more somber thoughts of existentialism
1046240	1050240	than aren't properly coded with wit and or humor.
1055240	1057240	This guy's laying it on the line.
1058240	1059240	Number four.
1059240	1063240	No unsolicited criticism outside the presence of the subject.
1064240	1065240	What?
1065240	1067240	You know, like, don't talk shit about people.
1067240	1068240	Okay, I got you.
1068240	1070240	Behind their backs.
1070240	1072240	Say it to their face.
1072240	1073240	Number five.
1073240	1075240	Constant quest for adventure.
1075240	1076240	Yes.
1076240	1077240	Period, period, period.
1077240	1080240	When offered two choices, take the less routine.
1081240	1082240	Six.
1082240	1084240	An 80% reduction of all negative humor.
1087240	1091240	Which is easier to execute than the more enjoyable refreshing positive humor that will replace it hence.
1101240	1104240	Well, anyways, suffice to say that the policy in general dictates a more light, carefree image.
1106240	1108240	Including in my writing, starting now.
1109240	1110240	Ah, that feels better.
1110240	1115240	Well, tomorrow I begin another mad dash to finish homework in class, so I'll better get some ugly sleep.
1118240	1119240	Instead of beauty sleep.
1119240	1121240	Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it.
1123240	1124240	All right.
1125240	1126240	Cool the music.
1127240	1130240	This is, this is the point where I started to go, this is fucked up.
1130240	1132240	Like, this is really fucked up.
1133240	1136240	And I don't know what to say to mitigate that before reading this.
1136240	1150240	I don't, I don't know what to do to protect myself from your judgment reading this because as I was explaining to Aaron, I don't, I don't know enough differences between me and this person except that this person bothered to write this down.
1150240	1158240	And, and like, I mean, I, I know, I know that this person is lying to himself, but I don't, me saying that is not enough.
1158240	1159240	This is a
1163240	1167240	Tuesday, January 23rd, 1990, 11, 14 p.m.
1168240	1173240	I will probably never forget tonight for two reasons, one big, one small.
1173240	1178240	The small reason is that I lost my virginity in the back of my mother's 83 firebird.
1184240	1187240	The big reason is that I realized what a complete scumbag I am.
1188240	1190240	I am the worst shade of evil you can get.
1191240	1195240	Tonight I played the role of the heroic super stud to the last line.
1198240	1200240	And boy, did I do good.
1201240	1204240	I said, get your hands off of her.
1204240	1206240	What a macho one I was.
1207240	1219240	I'm referring to this story that I've told, at least in another podcast, if not this one, where I, I, the girl I lost my virginity to, I met her online and I went to her place and we, for a couple of dates, we kind of, I went to her place and we made out.
1219240	1230240	Then her crazy mom came home, started yelling at her about a new kids on the block fan club check that she had taped together after being disposed of as punishment for not doing her chores.
1230240	1234240	She was 21 and had a kid and was really into new kids on the block.
1235240	1251240	Her mom pulled a steak knife out of a drawer and started yelling drunk and like, I stepped in between this girl's mom and her and with my acrylic sweater and my little rat tail and my zits and said, I said, leave her alone.
1252240	1259240	And so she and so afterward we went under the home bridge in Milwaukee and we had sex in the back of my mom's car.
1260240	1264240	So, so I'm coming home from that, I think, and, and, and really feeling my oats.
1265240	1267240	Feeling your oats?
1268240	1270240	I, does that, does that know what you do?
1270240	1271240	You, you sell them.
1271240	1274240	Before you sell them, you kind of run over and you, through your fingers a little bit.
1278240	1280240	If you love oats.
1282240	1284240	Love mine at 16.
1285240	1290240	I said, what a macho one I was and it all worked.
1291240	1294240	I was partly responsible for patching up a family tonight.
1296240	1299240	People were happy and safe because of Dan Harmon.
1301240	1304240	And hey, I even got the ultimate prize.
1304240	1307240	I fucked her in the freezing cold weather in a cramped car.
1308240	1310240	She came twice.
1314240	1324240	Here's, here's the punchline.
1325240	1327240	I don't give a shit about any of them.
1328240	1331240	I'm not even going to write her name on papers.
1331240	1335240	So if my parents read this, I can pretend it was someone respectable.
1338240	1339240	I don't even know what that means.
1339240	1341240	Like, like, am I in a yacht club?
1341240	1350240	Why am I talking like, like Andrew McCarthy in a, like, why I was lower middle class.
1350240	1354240	She lived in a, she lived on the, her name was Tammy.
1354240	1355240	She existed.
1355240	1360240	That sounds a lot like she didn't exist, but I have no reason to perpetuate that.
1360240	1361240	She existed.
1361240	1363240	It sounds like she was in there.
1363240	1364240	She might still exist.
1365240	1370240	Everything I did tonight that made it look like I cared for her was some realistic charade.
1372240	1374240	From my mother's soap operas.
1374240	1378240	Some half-assed reflex, something in me that needed to play life, just like on TV.
1378240	1380240	Oh, did I say half-assed? No way.
1380240	1382240	It was perfect.
1382240	1388240	All the while in my mind, I was up at comedy sports again, strutting my stuff on the AstroTurf stage.
1392240	1398240	To the delight of the rabid audience that demanded to see the new game called romance.
1401240	1411240	Stretting your stuff on the AstroTurf.
1411240	1415240	God knows I don't give a shit about anyone but me.
1415240	1425240	And then I drew a stick figure that is, I know is Maxwell Artfall, because he has a bandana around his head.
1425240	1430240	There are three stick figure women flocking towards him.
1431240	1436240	He's brandishing a little stick figure sword, and I labeled it Sword of Charm.
1436240	1444240	And he's holding a rope, as if to, you know, about to swing away like Errol Flynn, and it says, it says Rope of Apathy.
1451240	1457240	Some 16-year-olds don't know how to take, I'll let you fuck me, for the compliment it is.
1458240	1463240	Tuesday, February 13th, this is a little less than a month later.
1463240	1466240	All's well that never ends.
1468240	1470240	Oh, he's good.
1472240	1475240	Tammy was taken away to a mental hospital.
1475240	1487240	Real good.
1487240	1491240	He fucked the brains out of her.
1506240	1508240	Tammy was taken away to a-
1508240	1511240	You fucked her into a mental home?
1512240	1516240	Attempted suicide is illegal, you see.
1516240	1520240	Quite the opposite, Jeff. I fucked her into the pits of despair.
1520240	1523240	I wish I had another song cued up for that one.
1523240	1528240	I guess I did have to deal with her after all.
1528240	1530240	My hero.
1531240	1537240	After I got off the phone with her when I realized she was a manic-depressive schizophrenic who thought she was a Satanist.
1537240	1540240	She did think she was a Satanist, that's the true story.
1540240	1544240	I felt bad about not giving a shit about her, so I wrote this eulogy.
1544240	1551240	And it says, Tammy by Dan Harmon filled it later, and it's blank.
1556240	1559240	Like, I'll do it later, man.
1560240	1562240	Why don't you do it now?
1562240	1564240	Why don't you eulogize right now?
1564240	1566240	Roses are red, violets are blue.
1566240	1571240	Tammy, I'm so sorry I put my wiener anywhere near you.
1571240	1574240	Try to buck up wherever you are.
1574240	1578240	And I also apologize for the size of my mom's car.
1579240	1583240	And just as the poem suggests, she's dead to me now.
1584240	1587240	I mean, you know what I'm doing.
1587240	1592240	I'm like a 16-year-old nerd who actually got laid, and I can't deal with the idea.
1594240	1601240	The only person that would let me do it was this person I met online, and she was mentally unstable.
1601240	1605240	I don't even know exactly what I'm doing.
1605240	1612240	I just know I'm coping with something, some energy larger than myself, by being a woman-hating pompous asshole.
1612240	1615240	Acting like, well, whatever.
1615240	1619240	The uncomfortable thing is, this is me.
1619240	1622240	It's not like Aaron said, so what?
1622240	1627240	You haven't atoned enough with the fact that this is your 16-year-old self?
1627240	1630240	Why is it embarrassing if it's not you anymore?
1630240	1632240	It's not that it's me.
1632240	1640240	I mean, it's been a million years, but it's just too uncomfortable seeing the core of your personality.
1641240	1646240	I'm kind of laid out by someone who doesn't know how to dress it up right yet.
1646240	1655240	He knows how to dress it up, but his dress is like a special dress that belies the really gross shit underneath.
1655240	1660240	I'm sure he could come up with a much better metaphor for this, for what I'm trying to say.
1661240	1665240	I'm not just getting the same things out of life as everyone else.
1665240	1667240	This is another entry later.
1667240	1670240	I'm talking to myself on this paper, so I'll just be honest.
1670240	1672240	Look at everybody else.
1672240	1674240	They are so weird.
1674240	1677240	The way they talk, the way they write, the way they think.
1677240	1679240	They're not like me at all.
1679240	1685240	The only similarities I have with these people are the things I've picked up, acquired as habit like a foreigner in America.
1685240	1687240	I need a CAT scan.
1687240	1688240	Maybe I have a tumor.
1688240	1690240	What the fuck happened to me?
1690240	1692240	You notice I'm not talking like Frazier anymore.
1692240	1697240	I needed that first orgasm to get out the Shakespeare thing.
1697240	1700240	I am like the perfect person.
1702240	1704240	Everything goes swell for me.
1704240	1706240	I have so much to be thankful for.
1706240	1708240	Maybe the problem is I don't know who to thank.
1708240	1712240	I remember I had a saying when I was around 12 or 13 that used to amuse people.
1712240	1714240	I'd say, thanks something.
1714240	1719240	One would think it was a malicious taunt, a way of flaunting my then fledgling agnosticism toward God.
1719240	1720240	But it wasn't.
1720240	1730240	It was a genuine plea, an honest praise, a desperate attempt by me to show my appreciation to whoever was in charge without offending anyone by using the wrong name.
1730240	1732240	And I don't mean anyone down here.
1732240	1734240	Nothing has changed.
1734240	1735240	I'm so confused.
1735240	1737240	I'm so confused.
1737240	1739240	There is nothing to latch onto.
1739240	1742240	It's like an equation in algebra with no numbers, just variables.
1742240	1743240	You'll never solve it.
1743240	1744240	Never!
1745240	1749240	And don't think that admitting my confusion is therapeutic because it doesn't do a thing for me.
1749240	1758240	Should I be depressed, happy, introverted, violent, observant, ambidextrous, funny, young, prepared, afraid, apathetic?
1758240	1759240	There's no one to ask.
1759240	1760240	There never was.
1760240	1763240	Never will be anyone like me on this planet.
1763240	1765240	And who cares if there was?
1765240	1767240	The blind leading the blind.
1767240	1768240	No one knows.
1768240	1771240	No one understands the simultaneous pain and pleasure I live with.
1773240	1778240	Constantly on the brink of the insanity I swam in when I was younger, somewhere between seventh and eighth grade.
1779240	1780240	Are you a cutter?
1781240	1782240	No.
1782240	1783240	I was a this-er.
1785240	1789240	Who needs to cut themselves when they can do this kind of damage on paper?
1790240	1793240	Always finding a new excuse to postpone thought list, I go bonkers.
1793240	1794240	Is that nuts?
1794240	1796240	I'm allergic to my own mind!
1797240	1798240	I am so confused.
1798240	1799240	I am so confused.
1799240	1800240	What will become of me?
1800240	1803240	Everyone else has this determined look on their face, this purpose in life.
1803240	1804240	What do I have?
1804240	1805240	What will I ever get?
1805240	1807240	Where the fuck am I?
1807240	1808240	Who am I?
1808240	1811240	And how did I end up in the body of a 17-year-old?
1812240	1813240	Help!
1823240	1825240	June 20th, 1990.
1826240	1827240	Haven't written in a while.
1828240	1833240	I think I'm going to write a short story loosely based on my recent experiences in life and love.
1834240	1835240	I'll call it...
1838240	1841240	Twinkies of Inferno.
1846240	1847240	That's been our show.
1847240	1849240	Thank you for coming to Harman Town, everybody.
1849240	1851240	That's not the whole title.
1854240	1856240	There's a colon and then there's more.
1857240	1861240	Twinkies of Inferno, The Adventures of Dapper Dan.
1862240	1867240	Speaking of love, I think I am in love.
1868240	1869240	But she hardly knows me.
1869240	1870240	Surprise.
1871240	1873240	And she's going to college in September.
1874240	1876240	She is beautiful, intelligent, witty.
1876240	1877240	Here's the best part.
1877240	1880240	She only laughs at my really good jokes.
1881240	1883240	And when she does, she lights up the whole room.
1884240	1886240	I'd better put her name down for future reference.
1886240	1887240	And I do.
1887240	1890240	I put her full name and then I put her address.
1891240	1892240	And her phone number.
1894240	1896240	So future historians can track her down.
1896240	1900240	I go, what was it like to be loved by Maxwell Artfall?
1901240	1904240	I'll never forgive myself when she's gone.
1904240	1905240	Never.
1906240	1909240	Time for a poetry break, I say.
1910240	1912240	And then I write a poem.
1912240	1921240	I don't think that song will work with the attempt to the meter of this poem.
1922240	1923240	What do you want?
1923240	1924240	What are you feeling?
1924240	1927240	It's kind of staccato.
1928240	1929240	We'll do it a cappella.
1929240	1930240	Yeah.
1931240	1933240	There's not a place that you can go.
1933240	1935240	There's no one here you need to know.
1935240	1936240	There's not a thing.
1936240	1938240	Do you have anything by Dr. Seuss?
1939240	1941240	It occurs to me.
1942240	1944240	Someone had some inspiration here.
1944240	1946240	I will not fuck you in a car.
1951240	1952240	Upbeat, downbeat?
1952240	1953240	What do you like?
1953240	1954240	No, no, no, really.
1954240	1957240	Trying to make it work with whatever you pick will be more of a...
1957240	1958240	It'll be...
1958240	1960240	Let's just barrel through it like a Dr. Seuss poem.
1960240	1962240	There's not a place that you can go.
1962240	1964240	There's no one here you need to know.
1964240	1965240	There's not a thing that you can be.
1965240	1967240	There's no such thing as symmetry.
1967240	1969240	There is no balance, right or wrong.
1969240	1970240	There are no words.
1970240	1971240	There is no song.
1971240	1973240	There is no pleasure without pain.
1973240	1976240	There is no sunshine while it rains.
1977240	1978240	There's not a deed that you can do.
1978240	1979240	There's no one else.
1979240	1980240	There's only you.
1980240	1981240	You're on your own.
1981240	1982240	Do what you will.
1982240	1984240	You'll die when you have had your fill.
1984240	1985240	You'll die.
1985240	1986240	You'll die.
1986240	1987240	And then you'll see.
1987240	1989240	We'll share the answers, you and me.
1989240	1991240	When you were not, I split you up.
1991240	1993240	And now you seek to interrupt.
1993240	1994240	Go back.
1994240	1995240	Go back and tend your own.
1995240	1996240	You'll die.
1996240	1997240	You'll die.
1997240	1998240	You'll die.
1998240	1999240	You're not alone.
1999240	2000240	I think that's God writing that.
2000240	2001240	Two people.
2009240	2010240	There's two final entries.
2010240	2012240	We might as well complete the story.
2012240	2014240	And then we'll bring up Spencer.
2014240	2016240	I mean, this has been a full thing.
2016240	2017240	You've watched this.
2017240	2019240	You don't have to sarcastically.
2019240	2021240	I hope that was applause for Spencer and not sarcastic
2021240	2024240	applause for the ending of me reading my pretentious journal.
2024240	2025240	They're one and the same.
2026240	2027240	But you know what?
2027240	2029240	This guy wouldn't care what you think.
2029240	2031240	Obviously.
2033240	2036240	Are you strangling this audience with a rope of apathy right now?
2038240	2042240	I use the rope to get away from the women who are drawn in by my sort of charm, Jeff.
2046240	2047240	What?
2051240	2053240	Second to last entry.
2055240	2056240	August 1st, 1990.
2056240	2059240	1251 a.m.
2059240	2061240	I think that indicates that I've started drinking.
2061240	2064240	And I think I'm coming home later.
2064240	2067240	I ran into some old friends tonight.
2067240	2073240	I was at a stoplight in my 83 Firebird when a car pulled up next to me.
2073240	2081240	I noticed it contained Shanard Dern, Dave Harrison, Mike Musgrove.
2081240	2084240	I rolled down my car window and said hello.
2084240	2087240	Strangely enough, the first words out of Mike's mouth were,
2087240	2089240	smooth grip lube tube.
2089240	2090240	What?
2090240	2095240	I then remembered that two years ago I had used that term in a speech on birth control
2095240	2098240	to our oral communications class.
2098240	2100240	Mike and Dave were in that class.
2100240	2103240	They were seniors and I was a sophomore.
2103240	2107240	Now I was a senior, sitting next to them once again at a red light.
2107240	2109240	They were drunk.
2109240	2111240	The conversation was slacking.
2111240	2115240	So I mentioned the fact that Andy Luciano, the sports guy on TV6 News,
2115240	2117240	was at White Hen Pantry.
2117240	2120240	I said he looked like Don Ho.
2120240	2124240	I added that his wife was a Don Ho herself.
2125240	2127240	A gosh Don Ho.
2137240	2140240	Andy doesn't really look like Don Ho.
2142240	2145240	Andy looks Hawaiian, and the only Hawaiian I know is Ho.
2151240	2155240	Obviously a little tipsy going into the journal that night, I think, feeling a little...
2155240	2157240	Alright, final entry.
2158240	2162240	Sunday, September 30, 1990, 11, 4 p.m.
2162240	2165240	A lot has happened as of late.
2165240	2168240	I will not bother to dwell.
2168240	2170240	As of late.
2171240	2174240	I have become senior class vice president.
2174240	2178240	The class of 91 has failed in their last chance to win Homecoming Week.
2178240	2182240	We are truly the victims of an administrative conspiracy.
2184240	2188240	My experiences continue to push me up the ladder towards self-actualization,
2188240	2192240	spiritual unity with thought and body and deed.
2192240	2198240	As I progress, I begin to realize that the top rung is connected to the goddamn bottom rung.
2198240	2204240	Though it's not so much climbing to the top as it is learning to deal with this round ladder.
2207240	2210240	The birth of a model.
2210240	2214240	This journal seems so incomplete with all its gaps and ambiguities.
2214240	2217240	Oh, there's enough, buddy.
2217240	2220240	But I sense that this is it for this journal.
2220240	2227240	I just had a funny feeling that maybe I'm speaking over a decade or more to my future self.
2229240	2231240	And my wife and kids.
2234240	2235240	Oops.
2237240	2238240	Dan.
2238240	2239240	Old Dan.
2241240	2243240	Take a walk once in a while.
2245240	2248240	I may be young, but I do not lack in wisdom.
2251240	2253240	If I don't say so myself.
2253240	2263240	I don't know when to tell you this, but at this point I was reading this in the green room and I started crying.
2263240	2266240	Erin was watching me read and she's like, what is happening?
2266240	2267240	What's going on?
2267240	2269240	Because she saw how upset I was with the previous entries.
2269240	2272240	And then I'm like reading this and crying and kind of smiling a little.
2272240	2273240	And she's like, what is it?
2273240	2274240	What is it?
2274240	2276240	And I'm like, I finished reading it.
2276240	2279240	And then I dry my hands and go, I'm not crying because it's good.
2279240	2284240	I'm just crying because my 17 year old self landed the perfect closer to a segment.
2285240	2287240	I can't believe this kid did something right.
2290240	2293240	Perhaps you have turned to this book in a moment of need.
2295240	2296240	It's true.
2296240	2297240	I had no bits.
2299240	2305240	If so, try to remember the spark that we share and listen to me when I say that you should hang on.
2306240	2308240	I wonder who the chick in your life is.
2310240	2311240	Is she pretty?
2312240	2314240	I know you don't care, but I'm 17.
2319240	2321240	I know you've loosened your stance.
2326240	2327240	You must love her.
2328240	2329240	It must be awesome.
2330240	2336240	You two probably fight a little, but I'll bet she's the type that knows how to handle your little mind tricks.
2337240	2338240	You know what I hope?
2339240	2344240	I hope some rainy night you two have a fight and she kicks you out of the house or you storm out.
2345240	2348240	Take a walk or a ride in your Corvette.
2356240	2357240	No, I'm crying.
2359240	2363240	And she finds this notebook on the coffee table open to this page.
2364240	2368240	And she reads it and realizes that you really are capable of love.
2369240	2371240	You don't show it sometimes.
2372240	2375240	And I hope you really did name your child Max.
2381240	2383240	Because you're both Woody Allen fans.
2384240	2388240	And I hope that she, he or she is what you always dreamed of.
2388240	2393240	And I hope someday here she achieves what it seems you were not born to do.
2394240	2398240	Whatever and wherever they are, give my love to your loved ones.
2399240	2405240	And try to realize that your parents, if alive, feel the same way and would love a call from you on the visiphone.
2410240	2411240	Which now exists.
2411240	2418240	With that, I leave this the last entry in the first volume of my journals.
2419240	2425240	It would have been nice if it would have been a whole year long, but only the calendar runs on 12 month cycles.
2426240	2427240	People do not.
2429240	2432240	The sun sets once again on this crazy beach.
2433240	2434240	Jesus Christ.
2435240	2440240	The people continue to construct their strange shapes in the sand.
2441240	2445240	While the tide rolls in and out.
2455240	2457240	Spencer, come up, if you will.
2458240	2460240	Spencer Crittenden, our DM.
2461240	2462240	All right.
2463240	2464240	It really is a cut.
2465240	2467240	I mean, I hope the positive word for it is catharsis.
2468240	2472240	The bad word would be absolute draining, like just crippling sadness.
2473240	2477240	From 15 to 17, I think we would all be embarrassed by anything we did.
2478240	2482240	That's, it's pretty embarrassing because you really stuck the landing on it.
2483240	2486240	You really did it with a big flourish at the end.
2487240	2488240	You John Hancocked it.
2489240	2494240	And also you asked your older self to enjoy it.
2495240	2498240	And also to appreciate your youthful wisdom.
2499240	2501240	That's narcissistic.
2502240	2505240	I may be young, but I still have some wisdom to offer.
2506240	2507240	I've smarted you, old man.
2508240	2509240	It's like Looper.
2511240	2515240	I hope he kills himself as he keeps fake threatening too in all his dramatic journal entries.
2516240	2518240	Take a blunderbuss and pull him so far.
2519240	2524240	There's that sweatiness of adolescence that kind of stinks up the giant.
2525240	2527240	But still, you're still a pretty good writer back then.
2528240	2529240	It's a little Frasier at points.
2530240	2532240	You could lose the wilests.
2533240	2534240	Things like that.
2535240	2538240	And you noticed the wilests went away kind of as the sexuality emerged.
2539240	2543240	There was still some left over, but there was a lot of, it's kind of a stereotype.
2544240	2550240	I was like Shakespeare, but bad until a girl let me touch her boobies.
2551240	2553240	And then you were Kerouac, baby.
2554240	2556240	Then I turned into bad Kerouac.
2557240	2558240	There's a threshold.
2559240	2560240	I don't know if anyone's ever read it.
2561240	2561240	
2562240	2563240	You become John Fonte in there for a moment.
2564240	2567240	And then that's the threshold into becoming an actualized writer.
2569240	2570240	Sorry, John Fonte. I love you.
2571240	2574240	Alright, anyways, so let's see.
2575240	2577240	Should we plunge right into D&D? Probably, right?
2578240	2579240	Yeah, it's already nine o'clock, so.
2582240	2583240	Should we grab our character sheets?
2584240	2585240	Yeah, do you want me to give them?
2586240	2587240	This is the character sheet distribution music.
2592240	2593240	Character sheets.
2595240	2599240	Fluttering across the stage like so many pieces of densely written upon paper.
2601240	2606240	Spencer, if you will, dungeon master to the stars.
2608240	2609240	Bring us up to date, if you would.
2610240	2617240	In the last adventure, our heroes, guided by the barbarian Karen Broadleaf, finally arrived at Yellowwood.
2618240	2620240	The first of three Butz-a-Lot encampments.
2621240	2628240	Noticing something amiss, the gang came to the server that the Butz-a-Lot tribe had formed an uneasy alliance with Ashtail and his Blackpaw gnolls
2629240	2631240	in a bid to gain control of the entire Butz peninsula.
2632240	2639240	Sharpie single-mindedly sought out his father, only to find that he was in Blue Camp, gathering with advisors to discuss the dwarves' possible surrender.
2640240	2645240	But when the gang got to Blue Camp, they were told the barbarian lord left for Red Camp, the gathering place of warriors.
2646240	2655240	Eventually, Sharpie met with an old rival, Deadeye Duncan, who revealed that the lord snuck away from Red Camp last night with a retinue of elite warriors from the tribe.
2656240	2657240	But where were they headed?
2658240	2661240	I was pretty in the bag by then, I think. I think that might have been during a blackout.
2662240	2663240	Deadeye Duncan?
2664240	2665240	Deadeye Duncan.
2666240	2667240	Oh, now I remember.
2668240	2673240	So he said that my dad left with a retinue of gnolls or barbarians?
2674240	2676240	Of elite barbarian warriors.
2677240	2678240	And they headed where?
2679240	2682240	Who knows. It was presumably a secret mission of sorts.
2682240	2687240	You're standing in the middle of Red Camp, a few barbarians stand, staring and muttering to one another.
2688240	2690240	You're saying he told no one where he went?
2691240	2696240	Yeah. And he left in the dead of night, the most mysterious part of night.
2698240	2706240	You know, Quark, I'm no wizard at this, but I am a wizard.
2706240	2715240	And I think we need a tracker, an experienced ranger of sorts.
2716240	2719240	What about that weird homophobic chick that you didn't like?
2720240	2722240	Oh, my God, I thought you'd never ask.
2723240	2726240	Do we have any do we have a 20 on Mulrane Sedana?
2727240	2730240	Do you have a 20 like a location? Yeah. What's your 20?
2730240	2731240	Little buddy.
2732240	2737240	You look around and standing leaning against a post in a very cool manner.
2738240	2739240	Stands Mulrane Sedana.
2740240	2741240	You mean she was following us the whole time?
2742240	2743240	Yeah, she's a tracker.
2744240	2746240	All right. That's why we need her right now.
2747240	2749240	I saunter over to her.
2750240	2753240	Sauntering coolly, you approach the half elf half human.
2753240	2761240	Role player, Erin McGathey.
2766240	2769240	Reprising her role as Mulrane Sedana.
2770240	2773240	In soap operas, when I was a kid, my mom used to watch Guiding Light.
2774240	2777240	And in soap operas, I don't know if they still do this, but because they shoot one every day.
2778240	2781240	And so you can't avoid like sometimes a main character gets really sick.
2781240	2784240	And they just they have no choice that they so they very often like a guile.
2785240	2786240	Well, where's Clifford?
2786240	2792240	And then like this guy that you've been watching for 25 years as Clifford comes in, but it's a totally different guy wearing the same sweater.
2792240	2797240	And then this voiceover would just come in and go, the part of Clifford Johnson will be played by Daniel Piloff.
2798240	2799240	And they would just move right along.
2800240	2803240	It was the coolest thing in the world. Daniel Piloff was a good either.
2807240	2808240	Hello.
2809240	2810240	Mulrane.
2811240	2817240	Sorry, we forgot that you were with us or that you disappeared the last chapter of our campaign.
2818240	2819240	We were good.
2820240	2821240	We had a good time.
2822240	2823240	It's quite all right. I was on a different adventure.
2824240	2825240	Really? You have different ones?
2826240	2827240	Tell us about it. What happened?
2828240	2830240	Well, I joined a different campaign.
2831240	2832240	What were their names?
2833240	2836240	Their names were Suri Cruz.
2838240	2841240	And Jemima, Syrup Salat.
2842240	2847240	And there there were there were legs covered in eyes there, too.
2848240	2850240	And there's a lake of fire.
2850240	2852240	Are you lying? Are you lying to us right now?
2852240	2853240	Yes. Yes.
2853240	2854240	You're making up names.
2854240	2855240	You just followed us.
2856240	2859240	You've just been tagging along like a stray dog.
2860240	2861240	I've been in the branches.
2862240	2863240	Adventure.
2864240	2867240	Well, look, as fate would have it, we have a use for you.
2869240	2872240	Chris, you fate.
2873240	2877240	My dad's missing. He left. He didn't tell anybody where he went.
2878240	2881240	He left in the worst part of the night. The dead of night.
2882240	2886240	I don't know how tracking works. I don't know if you need to find a broken branch.
2887240	2889240	I bet Mulrane to Donna knows exactly how tracking works.
2890240	2893240	I do. I use these skills.
2894240	2896240	Describe them briefly.
2899240	2909240	I regard the forest for signs of of Butzalot's father, my eyes.
2910240	2913240	You were in an encampment in the plains and rolling hills.
2914240	2916240	I was. I'm such a liar.
2917240	2921240	I use my sense of smell, but now but now I'm present. Right.
2922240	2923240	You are present. That's true.
2924240	2925240	Oh, she's good.
2926240	2928240	She tracked her own presence. I looked to the ground.
2930240	2936240	Using your keen sense of smell, you detect the distinct aroma of Butzalot warriors.
2938240	2939240	There are buts this way.
2940240	2943240	All right. Well, lead the way. I lead the way.
2944240	2947240	They lead out the door. The smells do.
2949240	2950240	Let's follow these smells.
2950240	2955240	I open the door because I'm a gentleman.
2956240	2958240	Thank you.
2959240	2961240	Your token is accepted gratefully.
2962240	2965240	Well, you wouldn't you wouldn't notice that.
2967240	2970240	I did. I mean, you did, but these guys are pretty quiet about it.
2971240	2974240	My journal has turned everyone into a petty 15 year old.
2975240	2979240	A sad existential self-involved murderer.
2980240	2984240	Hey, why are you talking? Was wit necessary?
2986240	2987240	Unavoidable.
2988240	2991240	I'm sorry. I didn't. I detect unavoidable wit.
2997240	2999240	Yeah, hoisted by your own petard Sharpie.
3000240	3001240	Yeah.
3002240	3007240	We're going to take a quick break from the D&D game because I cast a pallor over the evening with my journals.
3008240	3012240	I just want to raise your hand if you're my if you were my biggest fan in the world.
3013240	3015240	Like if you think it was Adam.
3016240	3017240	All right. Second to Adam.
3018240	3023240	Like who thinks maybe like like like really you have a super claim like you really, really adored me.
3024240	3029240	Really, really like you could you felt like I I was really a magnificent human being.
3029240	3030240	What?
3030240	3031240	And now they don't.
3032240	3034240	Well, I wanted to ask him if it changed because of the journals.
3035240	3036240	It was great. It was great.
3036240	3037240	Thanks, girlfriend.
3038240	3039240	I like you more after your journal.
3039240	3041240	Okay. All right. All right. Hey, Seuss, right?
3041240	3042240	Yeah.
3042240	3047240	All right. Hey, Seuss says you like more. Sorry. I had to know. I let it out. Just concerned.
3047240	3048240	I like you more. Okay.
3049240	3052240	Sorry. Now everyone likes me less because I cared. I don't know.
3053240	3055240	Yeah, I told you I'm the same guy.
3055240	3057240	I just I want I care.
3057240	3059240	That's the thing. You you really are the same guy.
3060240	3061240	We don't change, as Tolstoy said.
3062240	3064240	Identity doesn't really change that much.
3064240	3067240	I still think women that have sex with me are bad people.
3068240	3069240	And they all go insane.
3069240	3070240	Thank goodness we don't have sex.
3075240	3076240	I'm too busy journaling.
3076240	3077240	Guys, we're having sex right now.
3079240	3080240	All right.
3080240	3082240	What? No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding.
3082240	3083240	You're doing it wrong.
3086240	3090240	Pressing play on the on this Spencer DVR.
3091240	3096240	You step out of Red Camp. You are an outside of Red Camp now.
3098240	3101240	It is evening. You can't see far in the rolling hills.
3104240	3108240	Still got a track on those smells. You lose track of the smells.
3109240	3111240	Well, shit, that tracking thing.
3111240	3113240	All it did was get us out.
3113240	3115240	I examined the ground.
3115240	3118240	You examine the ground and see several pairs of tracks.
3118240	3120240	It looks like they've been attempted to be covered up.
3120240	3123240	But your keen eyes see through the illusion.
3124240	3129240	I suggest that we follow the tracks that are most butts a lot like.
3130240	3132240	You suggest successfully.
3134240	3135240	Let's follow these.
3135240	3136240	All right.
3136240	3137240	Let's follow these.
3137240	3138240	All right.
3138240	3139240	We have torches.
3140240	3141240	Yeah, we better.
3141240	3142240	We better light them up.
3142240	3143240	Gentlemen.
3143240	3145240	Lighting your torches.
3145240	3147240	You shed light on the path.
3149240	3153240	It's just to keep, you know, like the Spencer suddenly hate this.
3155240	3156240	I'm so awkward, you guys.
3158240	3159240	Not true.
3160240	3163240	We all created a vortex of raw emotion.
3163240	3164240	Spencer's not immune.
3165240	3167240	We're all feeling very adolescent.
3167240	3170240	I just come here to hate myself every day.
3171240	3175240	Like a sand dune shaped by the malevolent monotony.
3176240	3179240	As many shapes as I intend to create on this sand.
3179240	3182240	I know the tide will inexorably come.
3185240	3188240	I was 15 too, you guys.
3189240	3192240	I wish I could have found you had you do punch up on my journal.
3195240	3196240	Wait.
3197240	3198240	What was the character?
3198240	3199240	The guy with the bandana?
3199240	3200240	What was it?
3200240	3201240	Maxwell Artfall.
3201240	3203240	We got to meet that guy along this campaign at some point.
3204240	3206240	Spencer, can we draw that character up at some point?
3207240	3209240	You know, he might have met his tragic demise.
3209240	3211240	I believe I heard he drowned in pussy.
3214240	3216240	It was, you know, it was terrible.
3216240	3218240	His rope of apathy could not get him.
3218240	3219240	It's only so long.
3220240	3225240	His sort of charm couldn't strike enough pussy off.
3226240	3228240	I heard he drove away in a Corvette.
3231240	3234240	The all new 2050 Corvettes.
3236240	3237240	With bizaphone.
3241240	3244240	I examine our surroundings about us, Spencer.
3244240	3248240	You fail to see the footprints that Mulrain Sedana has noticed with your key.
3249240	3250240	We follow the footprints?
3250240	3254240	Okay, let's follow those crudely covered up footprints.
3255240	3257240	Throwing caution to the winds, you follow the footprints.
3258240	3259240	They head south.
3260240	3261240	East, west.
3261240	3262240	There we go.
3262240	3263240	Southwest.
3263240	3265240	What's happening tonight, Spencer?
3265240	3266240	I'm just sick.
3267240	3269240	I'm going to say that every day it'll be awesome.
3269240	3271240	You were sick last week, you said.
3271240	3272240	I know, that's my thing now.
3272240	3273240	Are you in love?
3274240	3276240	Did you eat some bad dice?
3278240	3280240	Have you been licking your dice again?
3280240	3282240	Did you roll a number two earlier?
3287240	3289240	Did you roll a number two?
3292240	3293240	It's a dice joke.
3293240	3295240	And a poop joke.
3297240	3298240	Okay, sorry, Spencer.
3298240	3300240	We are concerned about your health.
3300240	3303240	Yeah, Spencer, is it an actual ailment?
3303240	3311240	I think I just have terrible anxiety across with it steadily poisoning my body with processed and fast foods.
3312240	3315240	It just combines to make me feel terrible all the time.
3316240	3317240	You look good.
3317240	3318240	I know.
3318240	3320240	I'm really good at faking.
3323240	3325240	You're like a plus 15 at faking, aren't you?
3325240	3326240	Yeah.
3326240	3327240	Sorry, Spencer.
3327240	3335240	I'm looking at my character sheet, and I noticed that you said that I'm 111 pounds, and I've never been happier.
3336240	3337240	I said I'm 111 pounds.
3337240	3338240	Yeah, but you're a dude.
3338240	3342240	Yeah, I think six pounds of that is penis, so be careful what you wish for.
3342240	3343240	Yeah, even lighter.
3344240	3346240	Anyway, we follow the tracks.
3346240	3353240	Following the tracks to the southeast, you make very little progress.
3354240	3357240	You track about a mile and a half before losing the trail.
3357240	3362240	It seems like it either veers to the southeast or the southwest, but you're not sure which.
3362240	3365240	The southeast, you can see mountains in the distance.
3365240	3367240	The southwest, you can't make much out.
3367240	3368240	Shit.
3368240	3370240	Let's go towards the mountains, you guys.
3370240	3371240	Right?
3371240	3372240	Of course.
3372240	3373240	From the mountains?
3375240	3377240	Well, he's going to meet with dwarves, right?
3377240	3378240	Yes.
3378240	3381240	And dwarves like being taller.
3382240	3385240	They'll do anything to get a little height.
3385240	3387240	They're going to be in the mountains, acting all tall.
3387240	3389240	I was going to say, I think they live in mountains.
3389240	3390240	Did they?
3390240	3391240	Well, probably.
3391240	3393240	I mean, you know, Lord of the Rings much?
3394240	3395240	Anachronisms much?
3395240	3397240	Well, I mean, I'm speaking as...
3397240	3398240	Okay.
3399240	3400240	Let's go to the mountains.
3400240	3401240	Let's head towards the mountains.
3401240	3402240	Live mountains.
3402240	3404240	You hike for what seems like hours.
3404240	3409240	Hey, Sharpie, you know, we've got a lot of downtime on this hike toward the mountains.
3409240	3410240	Let's do a walk and talk.
3410240	3412240	Do you want to make a journal entry while we're on the way?
3414240	3415240	Curse it, Earth.
3415240	3417240	It mocks my footsteps.
3418240	3419240	I'm so perfect.
3422240	3427240	Wish I could find a woman who only laughs when I'm really funny.
3429240	3431240	Then, then, I would give her my penis.
3432240	3435240	She would love it, for I am 17.
3437240	3438240	Nice.
3441240	3442240	Weird.
3443240	3444240	But nice.
3445240	3446240	Be comforted.
3446240	3447240	Sorry.
3447240	3448240	Take it back.
3450240	3452240	How long until we need to camp?
3452240	3453240	It's nighttime.
3453240	3456240	You've been walking for a good five or six hours in the evening.
3456240	3459240	I mean, you could make camp or you could press on.
3459240	3464240	You don't know where these tracks lead, so there's not really a good timing to it.
3464240	3467240	I think let's take a little break and let's play a game.
3467240	3470240	Like a board game or a word game or something like that.
3470240	3471240	Sure.
3471240	3472240	That's a great idea.
3472240	3473240	Yeah.
3473240	3474240	I mean, does anybody know any games we could play?
3474240	3476240	Well, what about like a role-playing game?
3476240	3477240	Role-playing?
3477240	3478240	All right.
3478240	3483240	Wait, what's that one where it's technology meets magic?
3483240	3484240	Shadowrun.
3485240	3488240	Can I be a Jim Nightblade?
3489240	3492240	I don't see how this is constructed.
3493240	3496240	A little too close to home there, Sharpie?
3496240	3500240	It's very clever and very expressive, but ultimately I think it's going to get like
3500240	3503240	a 1.7 and a Thursday at best.
3506240	3507240	I fear for its future.
3507240	3508240	I think it should just...
3508240	3510240	What's the worst thing that would happen?
3510240	3512240	I'm going to fire you off the show?
3516240	3517240	Not this one.
3517240	3518240	This is Harman Town.
3518240	3519240	I created this.
3521240	3524240	You created Sarah Silverman in Community, too.
3524240	3527240	Yeah, but this time I put Harman right in the title.
3530240	3532240	There's no way.
3533240	3536240	What if we pretended we were a family?
3537240	3541240	I know I'm a man, but what if I was the mommy?
3541240	3543240	But what if you were the daddy?
3543240	3545240	And what if you were the uncle?
3546240	3549240	I probably would go into a berserk rage.
3550240	3553240	It might actually help me to get through some of these issues.
3553240	3555240	I'm feeling really ineffective right now.
3555240	3557240	I'm trying to track my dad.
3557240	3560240	I left him in the first place because I didn't feel like I was enough of a man.
3560240	3562240	Now I can't even find the guy.
3562240	3565240	Do you have any stories about your dad you can tell us where we camped out?
3565240	3567240	He hit me with a magic belt.
3574240	3576240	What sort of magic was it?
3576240	3579240	It was a plus three against asses.
3583240	3585240	Oh, sweetheart.
3586240	3587240	Thanks, Mulrain.
3588240	3590240	But it's not sensitivity that I need.
3590240	3592240	It's to get my shit together.
3592240	3593240	Shit, shit, shit.
3593240	3594240	Such a fuckup.
3595240	3596240	No.
3596240	3598240	You're too hard on yourself.
3599240	3602240	There's got to be a better way to track them than just conventional means.
3602240	3605240	Wandering in random directions, looking for smells.
3606240	3607240	This is my dad.
3608240	3610240	I use...
3610240	3612240	You've tried enough. You've helped enough.
3613240	3615240	But it must have something better than that.
3615240	3617240	The father-son bond is what will lead me to him.
3617240	3623240	I take my mage dagger and I make a tiny, painless cut on my hand.
3625240	3626240	Painless.
3626240	3629240	Haven't had a dream in a long time.
3630240	3634240	I hold my fist out by the torchlight and I squeeze a little drop of blood
3634240	3637240	under the dirt at my feet.
3637240	3639240	And I say,
3639240	3641240	Och wah,
3642240	3644240	Och katahd nay,
3644240	3647240	Och bah bah havah,
3648240	3650240	Och havah bah hachay.
3652240	3653240	Magic.
3654240	3656240	Father, father find.
3657240	3660240	Well, divination isn't your strong suit.
3660240	3663240	But you do get the sense that he's to the southeast.
3663240	3665240	I said that. He's by the mountains, you guys.
3665240	3667240	To the southwest.
3667240	3668240	What?
3668240	3670240	The mountains are to the southwest.
3671240	3677240	So I avoided getting lost with my hand cutting and fake Arabic Jewish stuff.
3678240	3680240	Assuming you were right.
3680240	3681240	What time of day is it, Spencer?
3681240	3683240	It is evening.
3683240	3688240	I mean, it's like early morning, like 2, 4 a.m.
3688240	3692240	We use our torches and we go to the southeast.
3692240	3695240	I say extinguish the torches and travel under the cover of night.
3695240	3697240	It's safer to travel without light at night, right?
3698240	3701240	Look, I'm a barbarian gnome.
3701240	3704240	You are incredibly convincing in your argument.
3704240	3707240	The others are one over to your side immediately.
3707240	3709240	All right. We extinguish our torches.
3709240	3712240	Extinguishing your torches, you stumble around in the dark.
3715240	3719240	Slowly but surely, you head to the southeast before the break of dawn.
3720240	3721240	Ow!
3721240	3722240	Ow!
3727240	3729240	I examine our surroundings now.
3729240	3736240	You see off in the distance smoke rising as if from some sort of encampment or small village.
3737240	3739240	Sharpie?
3739240	3741240	I say we hide.
3742240	3745240	I'm kidding. Let's head towards the encampment.
3745240	3748240	Look, man, I was going through your journal last night while you were sleeping.
3748240	3750240	Don't read it!
3750240	3752240	You left them out, man.
3752240	3754240	You're going to find out how smart I am.
3755240	3758240	You talked a lot of trash when you were 16 years old, man.
3758240	3760240	I went through some shit.
3760240	3763240	No one ever understood me.
3763240	3766240	My roots punctured the earth but never drank freely.
3766240	3768240	I know, Sharpie.
3768240	3772240	There was a passage that really moved me when you talked to your current self
3772240	3775240	and you got the date exactly right.
3775240	3780240	And you wished that you would start acting like an adult.
3780240	3782240	You assumed that you already would be.
3782240	3786240	And here you are just hiding in a bush for the rest of your life.
3786240	3791240	The 15-year-olds hid in that journal and got hit by a magic bell.
3791240	3793240	And now he's asking you what?
3793240	3795240	And got hit by a magic bell.
3795240	3797240	He got hit by a magic bell.
3797240	3799240	Let's let that spell loose.
3800240	3801240	All right.
3801240	3802240	You're right.
3802240	3805240	You could cut the tension with a knife.
3808240	3809240	Or a stick.
3809240	3810240	Or anything with a finger.
3810240	3811240	You know what?
3811240	3815240	All that having been said, I think we head toward the encampment.
3817240	3819240	Triumphantly, you raise your thoughts on the bushes.
3819240	3821240	Oh, everyone loves the encampment.
3821240	3823240	They enjoy progress.
3826240	3829240	People like hitting play more than pause.
3829240	3831240	I just meant we're left-wingers.
3833240	3835240	We run to the encampment.
3835240	3840240	Running to the encampment, you detect the unmistakable aroma of Knollhide.
3840240	3841240	We smell it.
3841240	3842240	You smell it.
3842240	3844240	I smell it.
3844240	3846240	I love it.
3848240	3850240	Knolls are bad.
3850240	3852240	I mean, I don't know.
3852240	3854240	I just love smelling things.
3855240	3856240	All right.
3857240	3864240	I think this session of D&D has been the bringing Adam Goldberg up on stage of D&D sessions.
3865240	3866240	And I think we ought to know when to...
3866240	3868240	You mean exciting and illuminating?
3875240	3881240	We should probably set up camp and pause it and not do anything.
3881240	3883240	You don't have to camp before you pause.
3883240	3884240	You could pause before action.
3884240	3885240	It's like a cliffhanger.
3885240	3886240	Yeah.
3886240	3888240	I start to jump up into the air.
3888240	3890240	Freeze frame.
3890240	3892240	It's like a Toyota commercial.
3892240	3895240	Is there like a drop bridge I can start charging across?
3895240	3897240	Did I do it bad?
3897240	3899240	It's not you, narcissist.
3899240	3900240	It's me.
3900240	3902240	It's not you.
3902240	3903240	It's me.
3903240	3904240	It's me.
3904240	3905240	No, it's not you.
3905240	3906240	It's not me.
3906240	3907240	Not everything's you.
3907240	3909240	The only person who's not blaming himself is Jeff.
3909240	3911240	And really, I think it's him.
3911240	3913240	I don't know what he did wrong, but...
3914240	3916240	Maybe he wasn't supportive enough of my journal.
3916240	3917240	I love your journal.
3917240	3918240	I've been very supportive.
3918240	3921240	I think it's these guys with the matching jackets in the front.
3921240	3922240	Don't throw the audience in the front.
3922240	3923240	They're not matching.
3923240	3925240	They're just brown.
3925240	3926240	One's leather.
3926240	3929240	One's like a kind of a nylon-y kind of canvas business.
3929240	3930240	They look great.
3930240	3931240	Yeah.
3931240	3936240	I see a PS jacket and the other guy's got like a Nagahide thing going on.
3937240	3938240	I was just kidding.
3938240	3939240	I made fun of it because I love it.
3939240	3940240	I'm sorry.
3940240	3945240	What happened is I said last week in a drunken D&D playing stupor,
3945240	3947240	I was like, oh, we should not play anymore.
3947240	3951240	I wanted you to get your famous friend to come and play with us.
3951240	3953240	And then we couldn't bag him as a guest.
3953240	3955240	So then Spencer was like, is he coming?
3955240	3956240	No, sorry.
3956240	3960240	So now we're walking on a path for a whole week.
3960240	3962240	It's my fault.
3962240	3964240	The whole thing is my fault.
3964240	3967240	And I may have been an asshole when I was 16,
3967240	3971240	but I have become a person who knows how to over-apologize.
3975240	3977240	That is a coping mechanism.
3977240	3983240	And I have spent 30 years developing in place of math.
3986240	3987240	It was fine.
3987240	3988240	Great job, everybody.
3988240	3991240	Spencer, let's thank Erin McGathey.
3991240	3992240	Erin, thank you very much.
3992240	3993240	Erin, everyone.
3994240	3997240	Spencer, stay put.
3997240	4002240	Because I personally am concerned about this growing anxiety of yours.
4002240	4005240	Yeah, let's just talk to Spencer like a human being for a change.
4005240	4007240	Spencer, let's learn more about him.
4007240	4010240	Will your anxiety permit you to come up on stage and sit in this chair
4010240	4011240	and grab the mic so the audience can see?
4011240	4012240	Oh, yeah.
4012240	4013240	I'll do that.
4013240	4014240	All right.
4014240	4015240	Spencer, everyone.
4019240	4020240	Do you need a drink?
4020240	4021240	Do you want?
4021240	4022240	No, no, I'm good.
4023240	4024240	Spencer, what's going on, man?
4024240	4025240	I'm worried about you.
4025240	4027240	Last week you said you weren't feeling well,
4027240	4029240	but you said it was anxiety.
4029240	4032240	Are you agoraphobic?
4032240	4034240	No, I'm just weird.
4036240	4038240	But you've been so...
4038240	4041240	Everyone that I know that's heard the podcasts
4041240	4042240	or people that come to the show,
4042240	4045240	it's pretty unanimous that people really enjoy you in the show
4045240	4047240	and they love what you do.
4047240	4049240	Do you not feel welcome here?
4049240	4050240	Oh, I love it.
4050240	4051240	That's why I come here.
4051240	4053240	I'm like, I'm just anxious.
4053240	4055240	It doesn't make sense.
4055240	4057240	It's not like there's things that are happening
4057240	4059240	that are making me anxious.
4059240	4061240	It's like I'm anxious and that's making me feel weird
4061240	4063240	about things that are happening.
4063240	4065240	I've had that.
4065240	4067240	Because of this or because of other things?
4067240	4068240	Because of Harmon Town?
4068240	4069240	Probably.
4069240	4070240	I mean, I don't...
4070240	4071240	This is new.
4071240	4073240	It's not regular.
4073240	4076240	It's a cause of stress, both good and bad.
4076240	4078240	I mean, it just does that.
4078240	4080240	Anxiety is a thing that happens.
4080240	4082240	Respiratory alkalosis.
4082240	4084240	All of a sudden, my body was breathing wrong.
4084240	4085240	I didn't even know it.
4085240	4087240	I was getting lightheaded and it was...
4087240	4090240	It was because I enjoyed the San Diego Zoo or something.
4090240	4091240	I don't know.
4091240	4092240	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
4092240	4095240	It's just your brain will turn anything around you
4095240	4098240	into the anxious stuff.
4098240	4101240	Are you feeling anxious right now?
4101240	4102240	Kind of.
4102240	4106240	Now that you just brought it up.
4106240	4108240	What if I really focus hard on her right now?
4108240	4110240	What if I really call it into high relief?
4110240	4111240	Just my anxiety?
4111240	4112240	Yeah.
4112240	4115240	Well, I think I'm defiantly pressing it down now.
4115240	4116240	I don't know.
4116240	4118240	Well, I hope you feel safe here.
4118240	4121240	Because I feel safer having you up here on stage.
4121240	4125240	I think you create a very calming blanket in Harmon Town.
4125240	4127240	You're very good at what you do.
4127240	4128240	Well, I'm glad.
4128240	4129240	If that changes, let me know.
4129240	4132240	I'll gracefully take my exit.
4132240	4137240	If that happens, if I'm good, it's fine, you guys.
4137240	4142240	I think you're better at what you do than Dan or I are at whatever it is we do.
4142240	4146240	I think you get up here and actually get up and do a specific job quite well.
4146240	4148240	Luckily, you've defined it for me.
4148240	4151240	Yeah, so our jobs are undefined.
4151240	4155240	We have plenty of right to be anxious.
4155240	4158240	Do you like Dream Pop, Spencer?
4158240	4161240	Yeah, no, I saw that Dino tweet.
4161240	4162240	I do.
4162240	4163240	I enjoy Dream Pop.
4163240	4164240	I found out what kind of music I like.
4164240	4165240	It's called Dream Pop.
4165240	4166240	What is that?
4166240	4171240	It's kind of a synthy aesthetic, typically melancholy, emotionally.
4171240	4175240	But it kind of has more tone than melody sometimes.
4175240	4181240	I would say Massey Starr would be like a Dream Pop playlist item.
4181240	4182240	Enos.
4182240	4186240	M83, I'm particularly fond of.
4186240	4189240	I'd have to Wikipedia to find out the rest.
4189240	4190240	Do you have any?
4190240	4197240	Does anybody have any on their phone or iPod or something we can play?
4197240	4198240	I don't think it would be.
4198240	4199240	I'm just curious.
4199240	4203240	I think the mood is already too Dream Poppy right now.
4203240	4209240	We would need something more blue grassy to bring the show to the station.
4209240	4217240	Is there anybody here tonight that feels like they're going through a particularly troubling
4217240	4221240	period in their life, somebody that has a terrible problem?
4221240	4222240	All right.
4222240	4223240	Hey, Susie's hand is already going up.
4223240	4224240	I'm sorry.
4224240	4225240	It's all right.
4225240	4226240	Someone else.
4226240	4227240	It's all right.
4227240	4228240	Hey, Sus.
4228240	4229240	Can you come up here and talk about it a little bit?
4229240	4230240	Hey, Sus.
4230240	4231240	Spencer, I'll take his judging master seat.
4231240	4232240	Hey, Susie, I'll come up.
4232240	4245240	Hey, Susie, I remember it was in the front row, I think, or second row.
4245240	4252240	The night we interviewed every one of all races, and he was one of the Latino people.
4252240	4255240	I know you didn't come up, but you were...
4255240	4256240	I wasn't here.
4256240	4257240	What?
4257240	4258240	That was the one week I missed.
4258240	4259240	Pretty racist.
4259240	4260240	Wow.
4260240	4263240	Different Latino.
4263240	4265240	It's okay.
4265240	4267240	It's okay.
4267240	4268240	Different Hey, Sus.
4268240	4270240	I swear to God there was a Hey, Sus here.
4270240	4271240	We all look the same.
4271240	4272240	Jose, Hey, Sus, Pedro.
4272240	4273240	It doesn't matter.
4273240	4274240	I mean, it's recorded.
4274240	4278240	I remember his name was Hey, Sus, and I remember your name was Hey, Sus, so I made that connection.
4278240	4280240	That's called racism.
4280240	4284240	Or Alzheimer's.
4284240	4288240	As an ambassador of Mexican people, I forgive you.
4288240	4289240	Thank you.
4289240	4291240	So Nate, what's your name?
4291240	4292240	Julieta came up.
4292240	4293240	You weren't here?
4293240	4294240	No, I was here, but she...
4294240	4295240	That's what I'm talking about.
4295240	4296240	Julieta.
4296240	4297240	Never mind, don't worry.
4297240	4299240	Oh, well, Julieta came up a different night when we interviewed that.
4299240	4300240	It was a different night.
4300240	4301240	It's a different...
4301240	4302240	I'm off the hook.
4302240	4303240	I'm not racist.
4303240	4305240	I just have Alzheimer's.
4305240	4311240	See, you experience it, but I catalog it sort of in my mind.
4311240	4312240	Oh, that's episode four.
4312240	4313240	That's episode 14.
4313240	4314240	So that's why.
4314240	4315240	All right.
4315240	4318240	So what's the problem?
4318240	4323240	It's one of those things I feel are kind of like things I'm not allowed to complain about.
4323240	4325240	I have a great job.
4325240	4326240	I get paid.
4326240	4328240	Brown people problems.
4328240	4330240	Yeah, exactly.
4331240	4337240	Most people that are 40-year-olds, Mexican, that are outside Home Depot, waiting for a job,
4337240	4341240	hopefully they'll work 12 hours and then maybe get like 30 bucks.
4341240	4343240	But I have a steady job.
4343240	4345240	I get paid $10 an hour.
4345240	4347240	I mean, it's a lot of work, 12 bucks.
4347240	4348240	It's a lot of time.
4348240	4351240	I hate it, even though it's meaningful.
4351240	4355240	I told you about it, SpaceX, the drilling holes in the spaceship parts.
4355240	4356240	Bullshit.
4356240	4357240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4357240	4359240	You work in a spaceship.
4359240	4360240	Yes.
4360240	4361240	Yeah, for real.
4361240	4362240	It's no joke.
4362240	4363240	Tell them about it.
4363240	4365240	Oh, it's meaningful.
4365240	4368240	I just, I don't like it.
4368240	4370240	It's a lot of time.
4370240	4373240	I spend a lot of the time listening to your show.
4373240	4375240	While you're working on a spaceship.
4375240	4376240	Yeah, yeah.
4376240	4380240	Like welding like an X-wing onto an X-wing fighter?
4380240	4382240	What is the real image of what you do?
4382240	4385240	Is this the ship that's going to take us to the moon?
4385240	4386240	Yeah, yeah.
4386240	4388240	You're building the Harman Township.
4388240	4394240	Yeah, I probably will if I continue on to this thing.
4394240	4395240	Yeah.
4395240	4398240	But let them know that you're not saying these things because you're schizophrenic.
4398240	4399240	No, no, no.
4399240	4400240	Like you actually have a job at where?
4400240	4402240	SpaceX, you can, I don't know.
4402240	4405240	It's like a private space company, right?
4405240	4406240	Yeah, yeah.
4406240	4411240	I don't want to, I mean, I don't want to like talk up because what you say is way more interesting
4411240	4412240	than what I can say.
4412240	4413240	Well, I'll edit it out.
4413240	4416240	No, you work on a spaceship that's way more interesting.
4416240	4419240	And this is one of the most boring episodes of Harman Town in recorded history.
4419240	4420240	No, no, no.
4420240	4425240	I mean, like the first episode, it was really like I was immediately hooked because it's
4425240	4426240	like, oh, whatever.
4426240	4428240	I'm looking at all these podcasts.
4428240	4430240	There are a lot of good ones.
4430240	4434240	And then the first episode, you're talking about how much it sucked to be fired.
4434240	4437240	And I was like, whoa, like you were really personal and revelatory.
4437240	4440240	Like the first thing I heard from you.
4440240	4441240	And I was impressed.
4441240	4443240	And I started slowly.
4443240	4447240	It became my favorite thing in the whole world.
4447240	4450240	Well, I'm honored and flattered.
4450240	4451240	But okay.
4451240	4452240	So let's go.
4452240	4455240	So you're, you're feeling ins, unsatisfact, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction.
4455240	4456240	Well, yeah.
4456240	4463240	I mean, raise your hand if you're like in a creative, productive, media artsy kind of
4463240	4466240	thing, like that.
4466240	4467240	Yeah.
4467240	4468240	Yeah.
4468240	4470240	And you want that career to progress, right?
4470240	4471240	And it's just everyone.
4471240	4472240	So what did you say?
4472240	4476240	Wait, are you, are you saying you're creative, but you've ended up in a scientific kind of
4476240	4478240	cul-de-sac in your career?
4478240	4479240	Or are you saying that?
4479240	4483240	Well, just, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't, because I'm complete, I have no reason for myself
4483240	4488240	doubt, uh, to be really, um, uh, risky.
4488240	4498240	Um, I just read a tumble entry that, um, that, um, I guess I'll just say you, you, you
4498240	4500240	believe your mom didn't love you.
4500240	4502240	And, uh, yeah, yeah.
4502240	4503240	Yeah.
4503240	4508240	I make that joke for, well, I mean, I think my parents are a little reptilian, like kind
4508240	4512240	of like, you know, I don't, I don't, I mean, they say they love me all the time.
4512240	4516240	I just don't really, I'm not really, I don't really feel that it's probably my fault.
4516240	4517240	I'm maybe I'm the reptile.
4517240	4522240	I've also diagnosed myself with Asperger's and bipolarism and anything that comes down
4522240	4525240	the pike because it could be broken inside me.
4525240	4527240	Uh, but anyways, sorry.
4527240	4533240	I didn't mean to, but, but you're such a, are you, did you bring that up because you
4533240	4534240	feel like your mom didn't love you?
4534240	4535240	No, no, no, not at all.
4535240	4537240	I feel like I have no excuse to have all this self-doubt.
4537240	4538240	Oh God.
4538240	4539240	I don't either.
4539240	4540240	Are you kidding?
4540240	4541240	No.
4541240	4546240	I grew up in a fucking beautiful little neighborhood in a lower middle class suburb of Milwaukee.
4546240	4551240	We played kick the can and, and, and, and, and partook of the nectar of the, of the pear
4551240	4552240	trees.
4552240	4554240	Uh, I don't know much about wildlife.
4554240	4556240	My point is I took advantage of it.
4556240	4557240	I took it for granted.
4557240	4560240	I, I, we threw rocks at cars and ran away.
4560240	4562240	We caused trouble for the fuck of it.
4562240	4567240	Cause we lived in Eden, you know, it's like tied ropes across the street to, to, to try
4567240	4571240	to cause accidents and people would get out of their cars and go, what the fuck are you
4571240	4572240	doing?
4572240	4576240	And we'd go like run away because that's what juveniles are doing.
4576240	4579240	Like they're trying, like there, there, there, there's two, there's not enough pain in
4579240	4580240	their life.
4580240	4584840	If I was looking at photos today on Reddit of, uh, what's going on in Syria is just blowing
4584840	4585840	my mind.
4585840	4590000	Like it was particularly blowing my mind is that I was looking at pictures of it and those
4590000	4591440	functioning as entertainment.
4591440	4597640	I wasn't, we use that word to, to, to usually mean like, ha ha, this is so fun, but, but
4597640	4600960	you can also be being entertained by like, holy shit, that's crazy.
4600960	4604240	Like, which is what I was doing looking at these pictures of like people's feet getting
4604240	4608000	like, you know, all fucked up and like, like, like, just like everyone pointing guns out
4608000	4609560	of holes and cement walls at each other.
4609560	4613040	I can't tell who the good guys, the bad guys are or who they think, who who's fighting
4613040	4617920	who and it's, it's the, those guys are not like, you know, they're, they, they get to
4617920	4620760	complain all they want, but they don't have time.
4620760	4621760	They're not doing it.
4621760	4623080	They're like, they're like, where's my gun?
4623080	4624080	Where's my bullets?
4624080	4625080	Where's Fred?
4625080	4626080	Oh, he's dead.
4626080	4627080	Okay.
4627080	4628080	Where's Steve then?
4628080	4629080	You know, and they move on.
4629080	4631320	They, they're self-actualized, but we don't want it.
4631320	4632320	That's not the solution.
4632320	4633320	We don't want to live that life.
4633320	4638340	So, you know, yeah, the people who get to sit around and whine and have first world
4638340	4639340	problems.
4639340	4640340	Like, yeah.
4640340	4641340	Well, that's most of North America.
4641340	4642340	Yeah.
4642340	4646580	Like, that's the whole first world, you might say, but, but, but we also, you know, I mean,
4646580	4650380	we, we, we, there's guilt that comes with that, but the guilt doesn't really get you
4650380	4657220	a lot of places except for, I think it's a harm in town to get you, get you, anyways,
4657220	4663300	that was all to say, like, whatever, you don't have to, you, you've done enough kind of,
4663300	4664300	what do you call it?
4664300	4667300	Disclaiming of whatever your complaints are.
4667300	4669820	So imagine that everyone forgives you.
4669820	4673500	Imagine that everyone, that no one's going to be muttering into their coffee cup.
4673500	4677140	Then that guy got up and he, he should be grateful, but he's not blah, blah, blah.
4677140	4679900	Like what's your pettiest complaint?
4679900	4682340	I told you my gardener is doing something wrong.
4682340	4686700	I tell you, you know, I, I, I have chapped lips to ruin my day.
4686700	4691980	Like, what's your, what's your, what do you wish it was true that isn't or?
4691980	4697460	It's all the time I'm spending drilling holes into stuff that I could be in a room with
4697460	4700140	funny, awesome people making things.
4700140	4701340	And I wish that was my job.
4701340	4705820	I wish I could just get drunk and high and make things like I've never seen an interview
4705820	4709460	when you were talking about this embryo farm of like all these ideas and people would just
4709460	4710460	add to it.
4710460	4713940	And I was so excited and, you know, I have a Twitter account, but I don't do anything
4713940	4714940	on it.
4714940	4719380	I just, anyway, point is it's that I want that to be my job really soon.
4719380	4723220	When you were talking about a channel one on one and I started looking at all the channel
4723220	4731780	one on one things and oh shit, uh, you know, it's just, um, the, the jealousy of other
4731780	4737580	people that, uh, in high school, I, I thought that my dream was a little too grandiose and
4737580	4739500	I was like, no, I'm not going to be great after blah, blah.
4739500	4746820	But then like a dozen or so of my friends in the same class focused and struggled and
4746820	4747820	they succeeded.
4747820	4749420	They're doing what they love.
4749420	4751940	They're traveling around the world doing this stuff.
4751940	4757420	And I, they're creatives, they're actors, writers, writers, blah, blah, blah.
4757420	4758420	I'm not saying they're there.
4758420	4762740	And you made a sensible practical decision to go down like an engineering.
4762740	4768340	It's so, it's so literary or like, uh, but they, that you, you're not doing a creative
4768340	4772220	thing that you, as far as you're concerned, but what you're doing is drilling holes in
4772220	4776780	spaceships, which is, uh, you're the kind of, you're the, you're the, uh, you're the
4776780	4781820	mechanic of, of, of space flights, the, well, that was interesting for like three months
4781820	4782820	or two months.
4782820	4788140	And now I'm just, I'm still there feeling kind of like, like, like potential regret.
4788140	4791980	You're going like, Oh, when they all, when they all put their lives on the line for their
4791980	4795900	art and their craft, meaning that they ate ramen noodles and you know, they, they, you
4795900	4797060	took a more sensible path.
4797060	4800500	So now your reward is you're drilling these holes and you're thinking about Tony who,
4800500	4803940	who may or may not be fucking Natalie Portman or, or whatever it is that he's doing, whatever
4803940	4806380	the fantasy is or just having a good time.
4806380	4817460	I don't mean to make it sound shallow, the fantasy, I mean, cause she's deep, um, the,
4817460	4820860	the, I, I, I, I, I have, I have good news for you.
4820860	4828300	I, the amount of time that creatives spend, uh, uh, uh, doing nothing, even remotely creative
4828300	4831420	is like almost equal to the amount of time that non creatives do.
4831420	4834220	Well, I know I, I just spent four years doing nothing at all.
4834220	4836780	Like I could have spent that time writing, but I didn't.
4836780	4837780	Yeah.
4837780	4842220	But I, well, I mean, so, I mean, I guess what I'm saying is it's not too late and miss anything.
4842220	4843220	Yeah.
4843220	4846260	And you're worried that I think your concern might be that you would have to quit your
4846260	4850620	job because you can't, you can't drill a hole in the spaceship at the same time as you write
4850620	4858620	on a middle and notepad, uh, uh, what if a pickle, uh, uh, met a big foot, um, but,
4858620	4862260	but I, I just, I just did that at the same time as I was supposed to be entertaining
4862260	4863260	people.
4863260	4868700	Uh, which is, and for a lot of these people, the show has become like me drilling holes
4868700	4869700	in spaceships.
4869700	4876740	Uh, but it's, it's, it's becomes monotonous and quiet and, uh, there's a lot of sweat involved
4876740	4878780	bringing boring people up to talk like me.
4879420	4881980	No, no, I think this is, this is, this is more interesting.
4881980	4888540	I like the, uh, the mutual anxiety association going on, like, I, I assume like, uh, as soon
4888540	4892140	as you come up here, you seem so self-assured, like, like, uh, you gave me a patch from the
4892140	4893140	spaceship.
4893140	4894140	You're working on it.
4894140	4895140	Like you seem like you got your shit together.
4895140	4896860	Dan, I, we all assume has a shit together.
4896860	4899340	Spencer comes up here and nails it every time.
4899340	4903340	And it's, it's so funny to me that to like to look at you people and people don't assume
4903340	4905380	that you guys haven't got it all together.
4905380	4910260	Like you, you, you can look at people and assume that you guys have it all like laid
4910260	4916500	out as long as you just said so, but it's, it's very, uh, it's, uh, illuminating and
4916500	4922860	crazy to like, to find out that, like, that you're, you know, like in a vortex of anxiety
4922860	4923860	right now.
4923860	4926300	Well, deep down we believe in ourselves and believe we're great.
4926300	4931060	Like, you know, the journal entry, uh, you know, I believe in the whole, like, yeah,
4931060	4935260	I was probably around a couple of thousands of years ago in some form spinning around
4935260	4936740	electron blah, blah, blah.
4936740	4946300	And I have my past memories, uh, but, um, as I think as a dungeon master, I hate myself.
4946300	4947300	Make no mistake.
4947300	4948300	Do you really?
4948300	4949300	I don't know.
4949300	4950300	Maybe.
4950300	4951300	This is becoming my favorite.
4951300	4957740	I mean, there's escape velocity in this show.
4957740	4959740	Dream pop is very melancholy.
4959740	4962220	Spencer and I both like it, but we do have our shit together.
4962220	4964300	We are happy people.
4964340	4966900	And, uh, I think that like, and Dino's like that too.
4966900	4972060	He listens to like pink Floyd and like really, really bitter, dark, sad, depressing stuff.
4972060	4975820	80% of my music at home is, is a sad melancholy wallow.
4975820	4979660	Cause that's how we enjoy our, our, our, our great lives.
4979660	4982860	Like we go like, oh, who would have thought?
4982860	4987620	Uh, you'd be kind of, you know, everything.
4987620	4992100	And I think that that's the, that's the feeling that people who are happy have kind of because
4992100	4993420	happy has to be in quotes.
4993420	4994420	And so does sad.
4994420	4997940	Cause we've all met people who are kind of, who kind of enjoy being miserable and it's
4997940	4999540	hard to put up.
4999540	5003740	We all have friends or hopefully not a lot of us have them as friends, but they're like
5003740	5008180	in your circle of friends or like, you just kind of say about them like, yeah, he's, he's
5008180	5009180	getting off on it.
5009180	5011300	He likes being, he likes his own wing.
5011300	5016220	Like he keeps saying that, you know, and, and, and, and like, but that's his thing.
5016220	5017220	That's how he's happy.
5017220	5018420	And I don't think that's you.
5018420	5022660	I think the good news for you is you're actually on the precipice of making yourself happy
5022660	5027340	because, uh, what's the first thing that's going to happen before you make yourself happy?
5027340	5029020	It's not going to be you being happy.
5029020	5030540	It's going to be you not being happy.
5030540	5032540	Otherwise the next thing wouldn't make any sense.
5032540	5036080	So you're, you're, you're drilling holes in spaceships, you're, you're, you're raising
5036080	5041580	your hand when someone says who feels this way or that way, you're, you're answering
5041580	5045780	and calls us that it's supposed to, well, it's easy.
5045780	5047300	It's fucking like, yeah.
5047300	5049460	So is jumping off a cliff, kind of.
5049460	5051820	So is, so is writing pickle meets a Bigfoot.
5051820	5056180	So is, uh, the writing, the, the, okay, you know, the, yeah, this raising my hand and
5056180	5060460	talking to you when the great role model, blah, blah, blah, it's easy because it's following
5060460	5061460	your bliss.
5061460	5066140	So to speak, it's, it's doing what you feel like you really want to do to go home and
5066140	5069500	write something and actually stare at the paper.
5069500	5072620	Like a sitting in a room alone with God, I think was a good metaphor.
5072620	5075620	You might've been blackout drunk, um, a jail cell.
5075620	5076620	Sorry.
5076620	5077620	Sorry.
5077620	5078620	But, uh, yeah.
5078620	5084380	Cause God rapes you when you write, if you're really good at it, it's like, it's a, it's
5084380	5085380	a violent procedure.
5085380	5086700	Don't we all feel like that?
5086700	5088780	Like, I mean, I mean, yeah, everyone feels like that.
5088780	5092460	And that's why I don't have people that come to the show and sit in the back of a comic
5092460	5095940	book, uh, uh, uh, sorry, and listen to the show.
5095940	5099700	I think we're all kind of here for some reason or other, but the idea, I think we all have
5099700	5103660	great aspirations, but also I think that we're not arrogant enough to assume that the world
5103660	5105180	owes it to us.
5105180	5109540	You know, I think there's probably in this room, the mind power and the creativity to
5109540	5112100	do something like absolutely stupendous.
5112100	5113100	It's really interesting.
5113100	5117940	Like, like a town, like a colony, sort of like form some colony, but like, really like
5117940	5123340	from my vantage point, looking at Dan, Jesus and Spencer, like looking at like the brain
5123340	5128180	power and the sensitivity and the, uh, and the sensibility is like, it's, it's very like
5128180	5129180	it's moving to me.
5129180	5131060	It's like, I'm, I'm kind of choking up over here.
5131060	5132060	It's very cool.
5132140	5135940	Well, let's do an experiment just because there is such a Baptist revival happening.
5135940	5141300	And uh, you know, the, the, you know, God forbid that, that anyone leave and go, well,
5141300	5144780	that got a little, uh, cultish.
5144780	5145780	Let's just commit to it.
5145780	5146780	I called it.
5146780	5150300	We, we, we wallowed in a 15 year old's journal for a while and it brought out the 15 year
5150300	5155500	old, uh, aspirations and, and me, I think I would, you know, I'd say probably in plenty
5155500	5156500	of us.
5156500	5162900	And there's a, there's a, uh, a melancholy kind of, uh, Morrissey vibe going on in here,
5162900	5164700	but kind of a groovy way.
5164700	5165700	All right.
5165700	5166700	People of Harman town.
5166700	5170700	I'm going to ask you a series of questions and the answer is going to be Jesus at the
5170700	5172420	top of your lungs.
5172420	5183460	Who has the power to create who has the power to make the earth a different shape?
5183460	5195100	Who is so entitled to happiness that wait, I couldn't, I don't blame you sir, because
5195100	5199260	I kind of, I, I lost track of my thought.
5199260	5209340	Who is so entitled to happiness wakes that that he's, you know what I'm making the problem
5209340	5210340	worse.
5210340	5211340	Cause it's making it.
5211340	5212340	Yeah.
5212340	5222260	Who has a dick the size of Montana whose dick is made of ink whose penis is a mighty pen
5222260	5228060	whose dick will write life across the paper of the universe and whose dick writing will
5228060	5234100	make all the women and even me, God, that weep when they read it.
5234100	5238020	Who has a recipe for buttermilk biscuits that will make you shit yourself?
5238020	5239020	Really?
5239020	5240020	Yeah.
5240020	5241020	No, not.
5241020	5242020	Hey Susan, we need to know that.
5242020	5243020	Cause we're having a.
5243020	5244020	Rosa Parks.
5244020	5250460	I just listened to a Greg Poops article Rosa Parks Rosa Parks had a like a pancake recipe.
5250460	5251460	Oh right.
5251460	5252460	Yeah.
5252460	5253460	Peanut butter.
5253460	5254460	Peanut butter.
5254460	5255460	Yeah.
5255460	5256460	Yeah.
5256460	5257460	The peanut butter pancakes.
5257460	5258460	There's supposed to be fuck around good pancakes.
5258460	5259460	Yeah.
5259460	5262660	Not only, you know, one of the godmothers of the civil rights movement, she also had
5262660	5264020	a recipe for peanut butter pancakes.
5264020	5265020	It will wipe you out.
5265020	5266020	Yeah.
5266380	5271460	Who would have been better at serving civil rights if he had been there than Rosa Parks?
5271460	5272460	Hey Susan!
5272460	5274460	Who's smarter than Einstein?
5274460	5276460	Hey Susan!
5276460	5282460	Who's better able to do accents on the fly than Robin Williams?
5282460	5283460	Hey Susan!
5283460	5284460	Prove it.
5284460	5285460	Prove it.
5285460	5286460	Prove it there.
5286460	5293100	Who could go to Sea World, put his head in a whale tank and just start babbling in dolphin
5293100	5296700	talk and have the dolphins understand even though they were in the wrong tank?
5296700	5297700	Hey Susan!
5297700	5300260	Alright, now give Spencer some now.
5300260	5301260	Spencer needs it most.
5301260	5302260	He's ill.
5302260	5304260	It's become a faith healing tense right now.
5304260	5309260	Oh, but there's one over here that's having problems as well.
5309260	5311260	I sense the pain in his beard.
5311260	5314620	It grows from his face, but it hasn't detached.
5314620	5316500	He's holding his fears and thoughts.
5316500	5320180	What's wrong with you young man?
5320180	5321180	Things.
5321260	5327180	He has things wrong with him, but I feel the power to get those things away.
5327180	5332420	I want to ask, where do those things go when they go away?
5332420	5333420	They go into...
5333420	5334420	Seattle.
5334420	5335420	Yeah, I know.
5335420	5338420	Why would they go into Hey Susan?
5338420	5340620	Well, some of us in Seattle.
5340620	5345220	You know, to enjoy those revivals, it actually takes a lot of work I'm realizing.
5345220	5346220	They're not easy.
5346220	5347220	No, no.
5347220	5350220	Who has the power to do a good revival?
5350260	5351260	Thank you.
5351260	5352260	Thank you.
5352260	5362260	Now that I'm good at doing revivals, who's going to have his things go away?
5362260	5366620	Who could take those things and write a little script about them?
5366620	5371860	Maybe a modern family spec in his spare time between drilling holes in spaceships or even
5371860	5375980	an original idea that would be really bad and then he'd show it to his most trusted
5375980	5380180	friends and they'd say this is stupid and he'd say I know, but he'd wake up the next
5380180	5381180	day and he'd still be alive.
5381180	5382180	Shut up and tell.
5382180	5383180	I think it might be.
5383180	5394620	If you want to be a writer, you know, the first step is writing, you already know that,
5394620	5401740	but you know, a lot of people can't accept is that it starts with being a really shitty
5401740	5402740	writer.
5402740	5403740	There is no way.
5403740	5404740	Yeah.
5404740	5405740	Yeah.
5405740	5406740	It reminds me of all the stuff I deleted.
5406740	5407740	Yeah.
5407740	5408740	Yeah.
5408740	5409740	I kind of wish I could.
5409740	5411780	I think that's the nice thing about that.
5411780	5414740	That thing is like, I was not a prodigy.
5414740	5419860	Well, the embarrassing thing is like, this is pretty good, you know, like, well, there
5419860	5425700	were bad things about it there that got corrected over a long, long time, but also whatever.
5425700	5427380	There's conflicting messages there.
5427380	5430300	One message is it's never too late to start.
5430300	5434380	One message is it can happen overnight, but not until you do it shitty for a while.
5434380	5436980	Another message is like, it takes a long time, blah, blah, blah.
5436980	5442020	I mean, the only things that you can control are the things that you do the next day.
5442020	5443660	So you're drilling a hole in a spaceship.
5443660	5447620	I would, you know, I hope it doesn't have to come to a big decision to either like quit
5447620	5452620	and cast your life into chaos and better because that's, that's not what really writing, writing
5452620	5455420	as a being creative as a career, it doesn't really earn that.
5455420	5458340	Like that's just something people do because they have to do it.
5458340	5461780	Like it doesn't necessarily like need that as fuel.
5461780	5465820	You could actually conceivably with enough concern about it.
5465820	5469420	You could maybe drill some holes in some spaceships and like Saturday or something
5469420	5472500	like, like, like something like chip away at it.
5472500	5477940	Well, now that you've built up my confidence, I've been wanting to, I had a dream where
5477940	5483580	I played a 16 bit video game designed by you and I played the beginning.
5483580	5484580	So that's one thing I want to do.
5484580	5486180	I want you to make it like a flash video game.
5486180	5487180	I think it'd be really funny.
5487180	5488180	All right.
5488180	5489180	You should do it.
5489180	5490180	Okay.
5490180	5491180	All right.
5491180	5492180	And that video game will be called.
5492180	5493180	Hey, Susan.
5493180	5494180	All right.
5494180	5495180	All right.
5495540	5500940	It's not a real eyeball grabber.
5500940	5502460	Maybe we'll put some tits on the cover.
5502460	5503460	Jesus.
5503460	5508380	The video game in 16 bits.
5508380	5509380	Wreck it.
5509380	5510380	Jesus.
5510380	5511380	All right.
5511380	5512380	It's Jesus.
5512380	5518260	Everybody give him a hand and buy him a drink.
5518260	5519260	Maybe.
5519260	5521660	Spencer, do you feel any better?
5521660	5523340	Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
5523340	5528260	You guys, I don't get it.
5528260	5534940	Was that sarcasm or I don't know, like the right thing, but you don't, you don't feel
5534940	5535940	any better.
5535940	5536940	That's what you're saying.
5536940	5539900	No, I feel better physically and mentally.
5539900	5545260	Is there, is there anything Dan or I or the, or the, the, the harmonians here tonight could
5545260	5551700	do to make you feel spiritually or psychically better tonight when you're subscribing to
5551700	5557620	the podcast on iTunes and writing incredible ratings, like five star reviews.
5557620	5560900	Take a tall glass of kettle one and enjoy it.
5560900	5562900	All right.
5562900	5573220	Well, uh, everybody listen, keep your feet on the side of a tree.
5573220	5579180	Keep your hands on a dog and keep your eyes looking at the stars.
5579180	5580180	Well, one of them.
5580180	5586020	Keep your other eye looking at a, like a lizard that, that, that will keep inspiring
5586020	5588900	you to make your eyes able to point two different directions.
5588900	5594780	Let me go back to your feet because I should do me those up to have the first three channels
5594780	5598420	on one of your feet, Dan, honey, 15 year old Dan.
5598420	5599420	It's time for school.
5599420	5602100	Oh, it's time for school, Dan.
5602100	5604500	You dream the whole thing.
5604500	5609900	I dreamt I was a 40 year old fat man with a hot girlfriend, which, which I really care
5609900	5615100	about because I'm 17 and I know he doesn't care about, uh, with a bunch of people that
5615100	5617260	like him and always laugh at everything he says.
5617260	5619140	And thank you for coming to Harland town, everybody.
5619140	5620140	Thank you all for coming.
