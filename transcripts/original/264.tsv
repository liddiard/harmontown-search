0	9940	Harmontown starting all the time Harmontown is a podcast you can listen to no
9940	16440	matter who you are Harmontown the podcast starting now is the time
16440	25580	Harmontown is starting now it's starting now Harmontown damn nailed it
25700	32020	hello everybody welcome to Harmontown from the cozy confines of the star
32020	36020	burns box booth I'm sitting here with Steve Levy Spencer Crittend and your
36020	39940	game master I'm Jeff Davis your comptroller let's give it up for the
39940	45860	mayor of Harmontown mr. Dan Harmon all right thanks for joining us all right
45860	52380	top item I think for those of our you know for anybody who's been like an avid
52380	57340	listener as of the last month or so a couple of weeks ago I don't remember how
57340	62980	long ago we were talking about an encounter you had with Ron Jeremy yes
62980	69700	and we forgot to address this last week last week we had a galed time and they
69700	73140	were like there's whatever I'm not gonna waste time talking about the stuff I
73140	79060	didn't get a chance to bring up but so the to recap the story is that Jeff was
79060	84380	at a party and Ron Jeremy walked by him and had a banana peel on his shoulder
84380	88900	yes and said and Jeff said you got a banana peel on your shoulder and Ron
88900	93260	Jeremy was like I know and walked out so we spent like 20 minutes speculating
93260	99140	yes like why what's the explanation for that our first guess collectively I
99140	105140	think like that we were all very satisfied with was oh he walks around
105140	108740	with a banana peel on his shoulder because there's some gross kind of like
108740	114780	banana innuendo that he does for the ladies and Jeff's not like a pretty lady
114780	121380	so like he he wasn't worth it so I got the truth becomes fascinating so somebody
121380	127260	on reddit or somebody says an AMA or somebody wants to hit like you sent me a
127260	131540	thing that somebody went to Ron Jeremy's mm-hmm reddit page this is the
131540	135340	beauty of the internet and and well let's put a pin in a very temporary pin
135340	137500	because I wouldn't I do want to talk about this too it's like how do we feel
137500	141140	about what this guy did because it's like it's sort of like that's the
141140	146940	internet for you like somebody just blatantly just bluntly messaged Ron
146940	150920	Jeremy and said Jeff Davis on harmontown said you had an encounter with him and
150920	154300	that you seemed mad at him when asking about about you know it's like like no
154300	159580	no story is is it just it makes you cringe in the retelling it's like it's
159580	164420	like a Larry King reading Eminem lyrics you know it's like that's I didn't mean
164420	169700	it that way but this kid says to Ron Jeremy this happened what do you have to
169700	178740	say Ron Jeremy responds it makes me more appealing right so it was our theory was
178740	182380	correct except for one fascinating detail which is that it wasn't
182380	186220	pornographic it doesn't have to be though if you're Ron Jeremy everything
186220	191260	you do is pornographic exactly so he had this cutesy like like Richard scary
191260	198660	mr. Rogers kind of connect so we were essentially right yeah yeah absolutely
198660	206500	is is his built-in joke or admission in that like I'm not an appealing person
206500	212820	like I am NOT an attractive gentleman I'm not and so I'm gonna get out in
212820	220260	front of that you I called myself ugly before you did I haven't I'm more
220260	226780	appealing than you than you that you know now because I have trash so I will
226780	231300	say yeah remember when we talked about that how I took a big long chunk aside
231300	237860	cuz I was like I love my porn I love my monsters I love my underground people I
237860	243140	hate our society's like hypocritical treatment of of what we're now calling
243140	248820	sex workers but but and I was like you know it's like I don't I think we have a
248820	252580	very unhealthy relationship with that stuff and like I every time I hear that
252580	255700	Ron Jeremy was at a party and like so much you know someone will make some
255700	258780	joke that's like well I kind of you're talking about this person like a second
258780	265740	class citizen and stuff it was all wasted effort because you know he now now I can
265740	269580	judge him he put a banana peel on his shoulder and the answer was something
269580	275060	cute he could have just used it on you he could have just said it makes me more
275060	280620	appealing to you and he yeah but he didn't and now I like I'm a little mad at
280620	285140	him wait church you had a banana before do we
285140	290220	talk about yeah yeah there was bananas involved but we took a table yeah I I
290220	295940	don't know it's like the person that does that it that goes on reddit and
295940	301860	says hey he didn't he or she did not say hey Jeff Davis from Harman town just
301860	306580	said Jeff Davis like that matters to Ron Jeremy okay so Jeff Davis said that
306580	310940	you the banana peel you you're all pissed off about it I don't get the
310940	315020	instinct of that person is that is that someone trying to prove that I made up a
315020	320100	story that yeah okay yeah I want to talk about that too because do we love that
320100	323420	person or hate that person I don't know I mean because there was another time
323420	328380	and because now someone also by the way not to interject is going to now okay now
328380	330820	we're talking about it and it's interesting that we're talking about it
330820	340540	now now now two more people will will go you have a beef thing it's a stupid
340540	344660	instinct by stupid people like that that however it got us an answer but well but
344660	348260	then again he doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about who's Jeff Davis
348260	351700	he probably was a banana peel around all the goddamn time you didn't know
351700	354780	why he had a banana peel on his shoulder he was also engaged in fucking
354780	360100	cryptography yeah remember a long long time ago it took a troll to get to the
360100	366140	to hack and leak the rot rope and Jeremy leaks in the early that I think the
366140	369620	first time I ever even heard of reddit I told the story about the neurologist
369620	373660	that I worked with who did this crazy thing and somebody went online asked her
373660	378020	did this happen Jeff Davis said that you did this thing and she wrote back I
378020	381740	don't know you're talking about now either she doesn't remember what what
381740	385260	that she didn't remember that moment in the way that I and other people in that
385260	388580	room remembered that moment wait can you rewind that a little bit cuz I don't I
388580	393260	did a pilot with a woman who is a neurologist from Boston General oh and
393260	397840	and we were doing a pilot and it's based on her and there was an actor who was
397840	402780	trying okay you had a story and somebody during her AMA okay once no no no
402780	408100	emailed her tracked her down this is this is pre AMAs like at least as far as
408100	411580	this doctor is concerned someone just tracked her down and said hey this guy
411580	415500	Jeff Davis to show with you said this thing happened bullshit right and she's
415500	418580	like I don't know you're talking about I think he's probably like combining this
418580	423180	story and that story the thing is I remember what happened and also there's
423180	427220	like there's five or six people I could track down them absolutely backed that
427220	431360	up but she's not gonna go online and say oh yeah I'm a crazy person like like
431360	435920	the story is about her being a crazy genius either she didn't remember it
435920	438800	because she didn't because she's got bigger fish to fry because she's a
438800	444320	neurologist and heals people for a living or she doesn't want to go out on
444320	449840	record saying oh yeah I see dead people like like I have crazy superpowers right
449840	453860	because she already got like decommissioned ones and had to get
453860	457960	locked up for it so the fact that somebody goes out there and tries to
457960	464320	debunk this story well it's okay but that's so like this person that that
464320	473680	approached Ron Jeremy digitally you know I it's a it boils down to like oh we
473680	479360	wish that they had taken the time to like be more nuanced in their language
479360	482840	but really what they were doing was not debunking I don't think that they were
482840	487600	I think for that person you're using an example your gunshot I get it because like
487600	491080	you're saying somebody like fucking actually you told an interesting story
491080	494500	and somebody was like yeah but did that ever happen and like ask somebody else
494500	498400	for instance like one of the first times I went on reddit was I told the story
498400	502080	about my understudy and the king and I getting slapped the shit out of by
502080	506840	Gilbert now that's a fucking actual story but I went on reddit like I'm like
506840	512560	an idiot which you really must not do because it's a den of sadness and I I
512560	516000	went on there and they're like that didn't fucking happen Jeff's so full of
516000	519840	shit I'm like dude I can't even tell my good stories on the air because it's
519840	524840	too fucking too scandalous like I was there it's a real story but people think
524840	529200	I'm full of shit now have I exaggerated in the past or maybe fucked up of
529200	534760	detail or two of course but the thing is I don't when I saw the Ron Jeremy thing
534760	540920	is like is it is that somebody trying to zing me and yeah I I would categorize
540920	544560	that person's what they're actually I think they were kind of I think they
544560	549440	believed the story and they're fans of us with and Ron Jeremy and they they're
549440	554480	fans of us and maybe not so much Ron Jeremy that's that's that's the minor
554480	558360	problem I have with that person it's just that it was just like like well and
558360	564880	look I'm like I'm that person like they're not a that to me they're not a
564880	570040	villain because I didn't see villainy in that person doing I think they were
570040	574560	saying like oh like I'm on the internet I get to ask Ron Jeremy about
574560	578600	Harman town and we would prefer to have so much control over the universe that
578600	583040	the way Ron Jeremy hears about that interaction wouldn't come through like
583040	588240	yeah channel that removes all the empathy if I guess if Ron Jeremy walked
588240	593420	in here off the street we would be nice to him and we would ask him what the
593420	598440	hell was going on the banana peel if he came in here right now I would ask him
598480	604320	about that and I tend to think that it's not a thing he does a lot I don't think
604320	609320	that was a that's a that's a that's a costume he wears all the time around town
609320	612600	he puts a banana peel on the shoulder I think he was probably doing some sort of
612600	616840	riff he had a banana peel put it on his shoulder did a funny joke to somebody
616840	622000	left it there but I was a guy not a girl I just think it was a momentary thing I
622000	626960	I really don't think Ron Jeremy walks around occasionally or frequently I'm
626960	630920	squinting at you you are subscribers can see if you choose to pay us five
630920	634400	dollars a month to watch the podcast you can see that I'm squinting it yet nobody
634400	637760	is subscribing anymore they all stop listening when we stop I'm trying to
637760	641040	change that by squinting it okay well so I'm trying to add an element to the
641040	645960	podcast requires a book Ron Jeremy and get to the bottom of the shirt I know
645960	652040	for five dollars a month you could see Dan casting me a jaundiced eye but only
652040	659520	because in your defense kind of I guess I think his his his response to that
659520	663840	kids saying what's that story about being like one lies it makes me more
663840	671160	appealing it felt a little confident like like it but here's the thing Ron
671160	677040	Jeremy and I do not share we're not cousins on the spectrum like so I guess
677040	680920	I can't I can't compare his behavior to mine in that situation because I would
680920	685160	have been like my response would have been eight paragraphs long right had
685160	689680	that been like a I would have gone okay here's the thing I think there was a
689680	692640	banana peel on the table and I and I and I started put it and I started doing
692640	695160	this joke and then I was like I was walking around with it and I wanted to
695160	698120	go and I didn't want to take it off then put it back out or like you know I would
698120	701240	have all this like fucking like or I would go like you know what I was horny
701240	703880	that night and I was like doing this thing and it was getting some action and
703880	708760	and then I was like tired and I don't I don't remember your friend whoever
708760	711360	you're talking about blah blah blah it would have been a hyper verbal response
711360	717960	which by the way well how does that get me more results than Ron Jeremy I guess
717960	723920	the only thing I have nothing if I if because all I did was harmlessly ask a
723920	728920	Ron Jeremy that was four feet away from me who just passed me wearing a banana
728920	734520	spent banana peel over a shoulder I said pardon me sir you have a banana peel on
734520	740640	your shoulder and the only reaction that is confusing is him to go yeah
740640	747000	thanks it's funny because it's it's not funny in the moment that's why it's
747000	751160	funny because it's like you could have just said it makes me more appealing and
751160	758200	I think maybe I I think that's because if I were a cute girl well he might have
758200	763080	gone well does it make me more appealing and then what well also if you're a guy
763160	769200	yeah as you are true and and you go excuse me you got a banana peel on your
769200	772800	shoulder and if he stopped and said it makes me more appealing you might have
772800	778800	gone gross is that how you get laid you fuck my dicks bigger than yours what are
778800	783160	you trying to pull like he could have it was like it was like a it would have
783160	787200	been vulnerable I would never have gone that far I know you wouldn't have the
787200	792720	phantom father might have gone that okay let's let's role play who do I get
792720	797000	to be here no wrong answer you're on Jeremy but give me the reply that he did
797000	802720	like respond no no give me the it makes me more appealing like do okay do the
802720	807160	fun version of that okay sir you have a banana peel on your shoulder it makes me
807160	810840	more appealing oh you little devil that's that that would have been my
810840	815040	response yeah thank you because a guy outside the bathroom I said that and he
815040	820080	made fun of me he said he said you think that's funny like you're a piece
820080	823880	of shit and like and then he said some horrible shit about a movie I was in in
823880	828040	1972 and then he made fun of my body which is always on display in my work I
828040	831880	got this half bottle of champagne you want some you sticking around I'd love
831880	835240	some what's your name I'm Ron Jeremy I'm Jeff it's nice to meet you man I know
835240	838120	what I get scared of being vulnerable with people because I'm a public figure
838120	841800	and it's really easy to make fun of me you know but here's the beauty of you
841800	845640	wearing a banana peel on your shoulder for me if you just walked by I wouldn't
845640	849520	have said anything I would have said to my girlfriend oh shit Ron Jeremy just
849520	854760	walked by but because you had a gimmick or whether you're doing a bit or like a
854760	860160	thing or whatever like I got to say something to Ron Jeremy because there
860160	863320	was a specific thing happening and you're saying it it kind of in a literal
863320	867840	sense made me more appealing well it made you more accessible right it didn't
867840	872760	make me more appealing that's my concern was that I did it for what can
872760	876800	I ask you a question because there's a champagne oh thank you
876800	883240	cheers yeah clink I made I say I say clink because we're drinking out of paper
883240	888560	cups but you know that's that's me being less appealing I don't know can I ask
888560	895720	you three questions about the banana peel I trust you yeah you yeah okay
895720	900080	what's the origin story of that banana peel being on your on your right shoulder
900080	910080	my uncle Kurt used to do it I love uncle Kurt and he was actually in our family
910080	916320	like the running joke was that he had a really really small penis I grew up in a
916320	926560	very liberal family I was a child of the 40s you know back then there was a
926560	930760	counterculture that wasn't as publicized as in the 60s but I I grew up
930760	935960	on a ranch where surrounded by hippies okay I'll stop you I've read your
935960	940400	biography okay all right oh you've you I've never heard the current story this
940400	944000	is that that's I knew I know your whole life your child well he's one of the few
944000	947600	family members that actually yeah I didn't he didn't he passed away before
947600	951160	he could approve of the of the biography but everyone else I checked it out with
951160	954600	that's that's very thoughtful if you got a lot of people don't even consider it
954600	960600	uncle Kurt was he had the smallest penis and but the thing that always moved me
960600	969840	about him was that he everyone liked him like more and I always it's since I
969840	972880	because he had a banana peel on his shoulder no because he did clever things
972880	975360	like that that was one of those something that stuck out of my head when
975360	978320	I was eight years old the thing that stuck out in general about uncle Kurt
978320	983080	was that he had this very tiny little itty-bitty little wiener and I don't know
983080	987400	if it was because of that that that he had he was such a socially graceful
987400	991360	person or I don't know how much of it had to do with the fact that frankly
991360	996040	from the age of three forward my earliest memories as Ron Jeremy are
996040	1001120	people telling me I had a huge weird weirdly huge dick like even before I
1001120	1004760	knew what sex was people were commenting about my big giant dick now
1004760	1009280	is that is uncle Kurt wearing the banana peel because of a small dick is
1009280	1014560	there a core correlation there no I mean for me what I'm saying to you is it was
1014560	1018560	a thing that he would do and when I went to that party that night there was
1018560	1022560	bananas everywhere they were because I saw people yeah peaches had a banana so
1022560	1025720	I already funny it was one of the it was one of a million things that he would do
1025720	1028640	and I just kind of started doing it and I actually immediately started getting
1028640	1032920	results and it was really satisfying to me and the moment when you interacted
1032920	1041400	with me I I I was actually starting to come down from it because I had said
1041400	1048400	just before I ran into you to a younger woman you know it makes me more appealing
1048400	1053120	she's like that's funny like what it's a people say you're a porn star she was
1053120	1055840	so young she didn't know and I was like yeah I'm a porn star but I'm also a
1055840	1060600	human being and she was like yeah but why it like it went south really fast in
1060600	1064360	a way that made me think that if I had been born with a smaller dick like at
1064360	1067480	that moment I might have met like the woman of my dreams because I was over
1067480	1071680	hearing her at the at the table by the champagne and I was like I love this
1071680	1077160	girl and and and I was like I felt like I was locked in a box from birth by my
1077160	1081000	giant cock and I like and I was just like and the banana peel couldn't break
1081000	1085840	me out of it and then I walked past you and you said and I honestly I don't
1085840	1088520	remember the encounter but I'm telling you why that probably happened I was on
1088520	1091840	my way to my car I didn't want to pull the banana peel off because it would
1091840	1095880	look like a defeat but I was just on my way to my car and I just wanted to go
1095880	1099960	home and like just where I where I gained strength in isolation but when I
1099960	1102800	asked you you said does makes me more appealing this is not the version where
1102800	1106800	you where you snapped it like that do you sometimes snap oh oh shit yeah I'm
1106800	1113400	sorry I forgot sorry wait so now you're saying that sometimes yeah I snap at
1113400	1117280	people this is something that you do frequently okay now what now if you're
1117280	1123480	doing it frequently what's what's the what's the blue sky version of like
1123480	1126880	only women asking you about it like what like no no no I was caught up in a
1126880	1129880	moment that's what I'm saying it's not a thing that I do it's not my gimmick it
1129880	1134000	was something I started doing that I am familiar with that I got into Spencer
1134000	1144360	what's your take on the banana gate what yeah I had if I could have taken I
1144360	1149080	could have put that in an envelope and what's what's your what's my take on I
1149080	1155320	don't think that sentence finished well what do you think the backstory of the
1155320	1160600	Ron Jeremy banana peel shoulder thing is is that a one-off is that a thing he
1160600	1169160	does and why was he so I mean he wasn't pissed off at me he just I think you
1169160	1173480	guys got the to the answers already I think he's done a few times I think he
1173480	1178800	doesn't get anything about it by playing along with a male I hope it's not the
1178800	1183160	fact that he's trying to get out in front of you calling him an ugly because
1183160	1186960	the banana peel I think that's you know I don't I don't think I think that's you
1186960	1190560	reading too far into it I think that anyone can be more appealing they don't
1190560	1194520	have to necessarily think they're disgusting to have to say oh I could be
1194520	1199960	more appealing but he could have had a bad night I was like I I see stuff
1199960	1203200	retweeted that I've said to some kid that I had an encounter with and I'm
1203200	1206320	like well that's not me I hope that doesn't represent me he was having a bad
1206320	1211400	night but I mean we can't assume that he has a trunk of banana peels in his car
1211400	1216640	yeah that's like a bar trick I wasn't there a crazy Cody story you wanted to
1216640	1224560	tell what are you my publicist yeah well you kind of are yeah yeah well okay
1224560	1229960	this is yes totally to remind you last week cuz you didn't get to it I told you
1229960	1233360	to remind me yeah you're like I want to talk about that on the podcast doesn't
1233360	1240560	sound like me yeah I remember something like that I do have yes it's written
1240560	1247760	down here I didn't need that that's what's important okay thank you um I
1247760	1257720	here's the thing I recently got a text message from a writer on great minds who
1257720	1261400	I texted I said am I do you want me to give you anonymity he doesn't care
1261400	1267360	because it's about what this is about marijuana doesn't matter to him but
1267360	1271320	Andrew Weinberg it was right around great minds remember Andrew yeah he was
1271320	1280920	a guest on the show he he texted me and I I just came back from the weed store
1280920	1288960	and this is the bag they gave me my weed in and he texted me a photo of the bag
1288960	1293880	that they gave to put his weed in when he left the weed store and on the bag
1293880	1302840	was written why is it wait wait wait what did my distracted by okay what's
1302840	1307040	in the bag what's in the bag is a bunch of wheat who cares what's on the bag
1307040	1313040	what's on the bag is he takes me a photo of it it's my girlfriend it's it's Cody
1313040	1322160	it says Cody Heller and her phone number with area code and her address her email
1322160	1326800	address everything every conceivable thing you could learn about a human
1326800	1335160	being without dumpster diving was about about my girlfriend was written on this
1335160	1339880	paper bag that had been given his product in and he was sending me a photo
1339880	1343400	because he just happened to know even though I wasn't going out with I guess I
1343400	1348800	was going out with Cody during great minds so but he it is like this is what
1348800	1353680	they gave me and I'm like oh okay the immediate I so then and on one of the
1353680	1359160	one of the phrases written on the bag was lambs bread which is a flavor of
1359160	1364720	vape that Cody is obsessed with she loves lambs bread why is what well
1364720	1373760	obviously what happened not obviously but a quick you know think tank
1373760	1378200	session put this together this is a dispensary that Cody had been on the
1378200	1386080	phone with she this lambs bread flavor has been discontinued I mean she's I
1386080	1390400	really haven't seen anyone is obsessed about this stuff since like Justin
1390400	1395520	talked about like I don't know police Academy action figures or something like
1395520	1399560	like like she just had this obsession like she just she found this vape flavor
1399560	1404920	that she loves lambs bread it was just good she was calling around to a lot of
1404920	1409240	dispensaries and then it was also also written on the bag was like you can tell
1409240	1412680	the story even if you didn't have inside information you could slowly figure it
1412680	1417240	out because one of the things was something like willing to pay willing to
1417240	1420880	buy a thousand dollars worth or something it was like some form of that
1420880	1425520	so Cody obviously called this place it was like what's up with lambs bread I
1425520	1431760	gotta get more lambs bread my name is Cody Heller here's and then and they're
1431760	1438760	like oh shit let me use the the pot head equivalent of a database which is
1438760	1442720	writing on a bag next to the cash register all of your information because
1442720	1447960	wow that's a lot of that's a lot of pot vape we could sell and it just happened
1447960	1452160	that you that someone that you know what any of us that bag it just so have
1452160	1456800	that's fucking nuts well that's the if if Republicans are listening it's like
1456800	1461480	okay now you can use this as an example of like let's not legalize marijuana
1461480	1464800	however I'm way ahead of you because it's like no let's legalize it so much
1464800	1471280	that we can have pay really high wages to people that have like super
1471280	1475240	sophisticated computer systems when they're selling your pot but the punch
1475240	1479800	line comes because I'm like holy shit my girlfriend was like inadvertently docked
1479800	1491320	by this you know trusted weed vendor and fuck I gotta the I and I was I was
1491320	1493680	explaining I'm like Jesus Christ I'm trying to get to the bottom and I'm
1493680	1497360	like oh fuck man that's that's crazy like if it hadn't been you then there's
1497360	1500880	just a stranger out there with all your personal information written on their
1500880	1506320	weed bag and that's just just just bad form yeah but and then I'm like oh she's
1506320	1513240	gonna be bummed out about this but I have to tell her and and I and I texted
1513240	1517920	the photo and the story to Cody and her response her immediate first response
1517920	1524800	was oh no if they don't have my info I'm not gonna get my lambs bread what do
1524800	1528560	you think why is it called land what do you think lambs bread is just a flavor
1528560	1534640	no I know but like if lambs well once upon a time there is a strain called
1534640	1540040	God's breath I believe it might have been a relative to God's gift but God's
1540040	1545240	breath happened and it got changed to God's bread over time it kind of got
1545240	1550520	bred into God's bread and then God's bread colloquially got renamed lambs
1550520	1556240	bread in some circles or was bred into lambs bread so it's it's God's breath
1556240	1560800	kind of bastardized three generations or so I can't believe you actually know the
1560800	1563400	answer to that the only reason I know you're not making it up is because you'd
1563400	1567960	never put the energy into it like you'd get you wouldn't see the you wouldn't
1567960	1571040	see the point in lying but you could be lying you could be making all of that
1571040	1577640	up right well it's true Spencer like I've never seen you this nervous before
1577640	1583840	because we learned earlier that Spencer's new leased Honda CRV he's
1583840	1588640	already gone over his monthly allotment of miles for his lease yeah I got a new
1588640	1596360	car and I had it for like a week and I got like a cheese stain in the car don't
1596360	1600560	worry about the cheese stain we're about to let's just that doesn't matter you
1600560	1604960	guys you don't know it doesn't matter every day it's like Macbeth I'm gonna
1604960	1610120	fucking kill myself because I look in and see this faint grease stain in the
1610120	1614800	car that I know came from cheese look what sort of cheese what was the
1614800	1618680	cheddar cheese from what kind of like meal were you having a bag of cheddar
1618680	1621880	cheese I wasn't eating a bag of cheddar cheese but it was from a bag of cheddar
1621880	1626440	cheese was it melted cheese no it was just cheese but the oil got out yeah
1626440	1633480	it's a greasy item the cheese right why did you have unwrapped cheese on your
1633480	1637320	car seat well I don't know how it got on the car seat there are multiple
1637320	1643520	competing theories including my favorite is Jeff put it on the car there's no
1643520	1646980	subs there's no reason to believe that that's true but have you calculated the
1646980	1650360	worst-case scenario because what you're going through is like you're you're not
1650360	1654840	to condescend to you because I'm lower than you on the consumer scale because
1654840	1661320	you drive me everywhere but you're younger than me and I have bought cars
1661320	1664240	but not least them I've bought you whatever I've been through a lot of
1664240	1670160	apartments and had my security deposit at stake because I hung a picture and
1670160	1675280	oh no there's a hole in the wall that shame that fills you have you have you
1675280	1678760	give you gone to the point in confronting that shame where you've
1678760	1682960	calculated like the worst-case scenario about leasing a Honda CRV and having a
1682960	1688200	cheese stain backseat like what's the worst that could happen to you I'd be
1688200	1691480	on the hook for multiple thousands of dollars and I'd have a cheese stain in
1691480	1696560	my car well what do you but go through I mean what happens because if if if this
1696560	1702200	is a company that that leases you a car and tells you by the way we expect you
1702200	1706440	to never cheese stain the oh it's not because of the lease it's because it's a
1706440	1709440	new car oh are you just bummed out because you feel like you just got a new
1709440	1712880	car you it's already yeah I look like your old car that you love yeah there's
1712880	1718200	a giant fucking cheese stain well then let me shower you with fucking like are
1718200	1722960	you kidding me that's fucking like that's fantastic that's that's Spencer
1722960	1727840	juice that's that's that's no that's why it's terrible big because you yeah no
1727840	1732200	because it's cheese I know because it's like I might as well have been a D&D
1732200	1737240	stain have you tried to get some like some shout or something like that and
1737240	1743320	yeah yeah I'm probably about $200 deep and trying to solve this problem no
1743320	1751320	what kind of cheese Jesus it's a $200 cheese thing this is a I don't want to
1751320	1755920	dismiss that road but I was like like like also though because I resonate with
1755920	1759240	this like you're thinking like you got this new car it's like a it's like a
1759240	1763040	grown-up car right like you're like a child yeah you got like a grown-up car
1763040	1766920	and you saw the cheese stain and you're like oh I'm already doing it wrong like
1766920	1771240	I didn't I didn't do what my mom would do or like what a grown-up does or like
1771240	1776560	what your favorite cop character on TV would do like like right Adam Sandberg
1776560	1783360	benefit Adam Sandberg he loves getting his name mixed up with Adam Sandler
1783360	1788520	Adam Sandberg's cop cop car wouldn't have cheese stains on it well first of
1788520	1792400	all I doubt that I'm sure if that's a lovable say I probably have some cheese
1792400	1798360	this resonates with me like if I put myself in your shoes or your car my OCD
1798360	1803240	I would never not notice the cheese no I know I can literally feel it in the back
1803240	1808280	of my head when I'm driving I can feel it behind me in the in the seat like I
1808280	1812400	just it's not my seat like it's in the it's in the back seat but I just its
1812400	1817400	presence is there and undeniable but you pick me up for work every day and drive
1817400	1822000	me everywhere and you and I'm on the verge of killing us both because of this
1822000	1826800	cheese stain and I would accept that if you were if we got to heaven and and
1826800	1831120	you would say I'm sorry man I had a cheese stain and I had to what was life
1831120	1834780	worth I was like that's why you swerved into oncoming traffic and I'd be like
1834780	1838120	you know what better better reason to die than because we elected a
1838120	1848440	dyslexic fucking stroked out humunculus I would say take take the Honda back to
1848440	1852280	the Honda dealership and say look I got this fucking cheese stain back here it's
1852280	1855880	driving me crazy do you guys think they'll know how to get the cheese stain
1855880	1859680	out I thought about that I want to take it to get detailed but can I be the
1859680	1865600	other devil on your shoulder cuz there's no angel in this equation fucking take
1865600	1869320	another bag of cheese and fucking rub it all over that thing all right not not
1869320	1874720	that that was that's Dino if you were here yeah I'm saying like this this
1874720	1879480	solution isn't to avoid cheese stains because that creates an economy a
1879480	1883520	psychological economy where you're like then you're always one cheese stain away
1883520	1889000	from being deregulated the solution is to actually accept the cheese stain that
1889000	1894080	because then that helps you cope with like reality the first time I leased a
1894080	1897840	car I obsessed about it so much and the first time I got a little Nick like
1897840	1901640	somebody opened their door into my door and there's a little ding there it drove
1901640	1906520	me fucking crazy because I remember I wanted that thing to be perfect and now
1906520	1910360	like having at least a bunch of cars you don't give a shit they don't got his
1910360	1917160	first Lexus like yeah you weren't a dick or anything but it was like no fucking
1917160	1921800	eclipsed his life I was like he had us cuz I only had shitty cars before I'd
1921800	1925000	only had cars that were covered in cheese stains like the whole and it
1925000	1929560	wasn't because you became a materialist it was because I felt like an adult it
1929560	1934560	was because you felt like we're fucking up adulting yeah I know exact that's
1934560	1938480	first day of school for everybody you you you just get this big chance and you
1938480	1942120	lay out your pants and your binders and all stuff and then the first time it's
1942120	1946480	like oh my homework's got bubblegum on it and then we we just go like god
1946480	1949960	fucking damn it I knew it I knew I'm a piece of shit I knew it yeah you hear
1949960	1954200	your mother's voice in your head yeah fucking up that's why I'm mad it's not
1954200	1959600	because of any of else it's not like the practical struggles of a stain like
1959600	1964240	that's that's literally the only reason why that's what I want to address to help
1964240	1968360	you feel better because first first step that makes you 90% feel better is
1968360	1972480	talking about it because as soon as it comes out of your mouth you know it's
1972480	1979840	like and then the next 10% is us going like yeah man me too me too I I was
1979840	1982480	pretty impressed that you had a new car until I found that it was the fucking
1982480	1988240	cheese stain car outside of the cheese stain though how do you like that car
1988240	1992880	that's fine he likes it so much he's going over his miles oh man it's the
1992880	1999280	millet the mile the idea of a mileage cap bummed me out I haven't I haven't
1999280	2006200	had a car since gave my my Prius to McGathey and the divorce and I I don't
2006200	2010800	I don't need to drive anywhere apparently I found that out well Spencer
2010800	2015520	doesn't he's fucking is he's gonna kill himself do you ever you get sick of me
2015520	2020440	you looking forward to me like not needing a ride everywhere I think that
2020440	2026040	the schedule demands that sometimes arise from the worst-case scenarios of
2026040	2030240	having to drive you around can be a hassle but the actual driving of you
2030240	2034960	around is not a hassle like that's that's all fine and good but sometimes
2034960	2038280	it's like well it means I got to get up and leave the house at eight and then I
2038280	2042160	might be on the hook until like eight or something and I like you know that's
2042160	2046560	that's where the problems come in but especially lately that's never been the
2046560	2051280	case like we've been really easygoing lately so I am looking forward to well
2051280	2056680	because also in my own personal schedule I've made a kind of like decision and
2056680	2060320	I'm like I'm gonna pull back and take it easy with the workaholism a little bit
2060320	2064960	that probably affects it a little where I'm like oh I don't my own but maybe
2064960	2070800	also up and by the way for those of you who joined us in the beginning and we
2070800	2076440	haven't explained it Jeff and church are doing hands made it made still cosplay
2076440	2081960	right we we explained that while the audio was out and then Jeff like Jeff
2081960	2085320	Jeff had come in and sat down and for the last I love that for the last 30
2085320	2090160	minutes Jeff has been with a completely straight face just being Jeff and he has
2090160	2097000	this fucking ridiculous beard it's pretty funny but that's yeah my beard is
2097000	2101320	itchy because it's fake and I've got spirit gum on there's mesh but how do
2101320	2106240	you guys you guys all have beards it's terrible you're wearing a big old thing
2106240	2109560	on your face all the time it's like I want to blow my brains up my grandmother
2109560	2114920	yeah me too she yells at me oh yeah oh yeah wait wait because because kissing
2114920	2121160	you is less essential no she's she says that men with beards are inherently less
2121160	2124760	handsome it's like an old way of thinking she's like you guys are gross
2124760	2132640	did you tell her that that old women are less attractive no no well then that's
2132640	2136280	she's just privileged you could just kick back and enjoy it she's like yeah
2136280	2139880	grandma you got it I'm a real ugly piece of shit
2139880	2147680	wink wink to God every other every other paper flesh isn't gross at all no
2147680	2151240	one has a right to shame you for that because it's not a choice you're just
2151240	2154920	melting she's she's being old-school because Jewish Paul Newman wouldn't have
2154920	2161640	a beard I'm sorry I told him it was Jewish yeah but you're you're like the
2161640	2168440	Jewish Paul Newman Paul Newman could never be as Jewish as you no matter how
2168440	2175120	hard he tried I don't think he went to temple as much he goes he probably went
2175120	2179320	to tell him more than me did you love your grandma yeah she's she's great do
2179320	2187040	you think she's an attractive person I like physically yeah she went there okay
2187040	2192280	no don't do don't her don't do that to you how about we live in a society where
2192280	2196680	reason is God and rule of law covers the land we don't judge people by whether
2196680	2199920	they're like why are Grandma's grandfathered in well I could kiss
2199920	2203800	because they're grandmas but it's like you know they oh oh you're so cute does
2203800	2207000	that you know what I wonder how much of the fucking patriarchy is upheld by
2207000	2211320	grandmas who are like like oh you're so when are you gonna get married when are
2211320	2214440	you gonna look better when you get why don't you show some leg like grandmas
2214440	2221680	sound like Don Draper oh the specter of inequality is we went to a church took
2221680	2225760	me to Adam Levine's annual Halloween party and I carried around dressed as
2225760	2230360	commander Fred from right from Handmaid's Tale with my Scrabble box and
2230360	2235760	I think only four people laughed at that were there a lot of I think there was a
2235760	2239600	there was an early prediction that that was gonna be that that Halloween was
2239600	2248960	gonna be like an army of handmaids yeah Ricky Lindholm was there Ricky from a
2248960	2254960	Garfunkel from Garfunkel and Oates she was there as a handmaid there was a
2254960	2258880	couple there was a couple who were the commander and the commander's wife who
2258880	2264840	had a blow-up doll dressed as a handmaid in between them I have so many
2264840	2268600	questions about that show I was surprised I could say what how many
2268600	2274880	people that were that party few hundred okay and I didn't I was surprised I
2274880	2280920	didn't see any Rick and Morty costumes but that's kind of a Hollywood rock and
2280920	2287200	roller well I mean I was it I got texted a hundred pictures of people okay
2287200	2290480	well somebody I said cuz I was like I remember the I remember the year when
2290480	2294560	there were none and then the year when there were a thousand and I I don't know
2294560	2299640	within that year I don't know yeah if it was like it's got to be one of the
2299640	2308160	most popular costumes oh yeah well at the at the Starburns party that we had
2308160	2312760	there were literally because the entire art department of Harmon quest like they
2312760	2316360	they coordinated there was an army of Spencer's I'm sure you already know that
2316360	2320880	yeah does that make you feel better or worse about not coming to the party
2320880	2327480	worse I tried to go to the party I tried to go three times but Mario Odyssey
2327480	2331600	came out that wasn't why I didn't you were too busy putting that cheese in
2331600	2336320	your seat yeah I was what was what was the reason when you share it I was like
2336320	2344240	yeah that was scared or anxious like I drove up to park and yeah you were out
2344240	2348800	you went all the way there yeah no three times I went all the way what this is
2348800	2353560	what I mean do you mind it can we talk about yeah so tell it talk about like
2353560	2359200	what goes through your mind that like makes the difference between parking the
2359200	2364160	car and going into a party and continuing on like like what are the I'm
2364160	2366920	trying to figure out a better way to rephrase this so that you can answer
2366920	2371240	easy question I don't know it's hard because it's not like I don't know I've
2371240	2375240	had anxiety where it is like a conversation you know where it's like if
2375240	2379320	you go in they're gonna be mean or you know whatever and it wasn't like that
2379320	2384120	lately it's just been more just like a pressure upwelling it's like I'm gonna
2384120	2389960	do this and then you just get there and it's like I don't know you know it's like
2389960	2397360	more worried about if you if you let's I'm trying to figure out how to phrase
2397360	2402600	this so that I cuz based on my experience if you had a button in your
2402600	2411240	hand that was that the amount of pressure on the button created more or
2411240	2419320	less attention on you more or less people demanding answers from you about
2419320	2425840	how you're doing and how you've been in all this stuff it would you like how
2425840	2432080	hard I guess you're not you're not afraid of obscurity that's not the
2432080	2435640	rate you're afraid of attention right I don't know I mean when you're saying the
2435640	2440080	button it's like I think it's both like I'm thinking I'm thinking well yeah it's
2440080	2444560	like I'm worried about I don't know like when I was trying to park I saw all
2444560	2448960	these people outside and I was like I'm gonna have to get past these people to
2448960	2452920	get to the party and like that in its own was like a thing but it's not like
2452920	2456400	I didn't not want to talk to those people and I wanted to go the party
2456400	2459720	because I did want to talk to people so it's not like I didn't want to be
2459720	2464320	noticed and I wanted to be noted or it's like it's both but it's not either or
2464320	2469520	neither but yeah it's kind of lack of control over a social situation where
2469520	2473840	it's like if you're if you're obscure like I remember being 25 and like the
2473840	2476840	channel 101 days it's like we all went to each other's parties because it was
2476840	2480320	sort of an orgy of the more attention the better and actually we're all on the
2480320	2483840	same level and we can all just like pay attention to each other and nobody's
2483840	2491120	really like suffering and and then but like it for me it's a control issue
2491120	2496200	where I'm like you know actually I have nothing to gain anymore and no
2496200	2501600	camaraderie to achieve I only have maybe people that I'd like to talk to and then
2501600	2507480	a whole shit ton of people that I can either disappoint or ignore right I like
2507480	2511440	that sounds like I'm casting it in terms of like you think you're a rock star I
2511440	2515800	do that though because I don't feel like the camaraderie you say like I don't
2515800	2519200	feel like I'm gonna go to this party and I will feel closer to these people as a
2519200	2523120	result like that might be true but that's not what I feel going into it it's
2523120	2529520	just like this could be fun and then that quickly gets like consumed by
2529520	2532400	everything else when the sense of responsibility comes in when you are
2532400	2537280	like obligation when you look at like a little bit of a minefield of like eight
2537280	2542440	eight groups of people and you're like you know what I'm never gonna like and
2542440	2546200	then you find yourself in a conversation with somebody and you're like shit I
2546200	2551200	don't know when to leave or if I should want to leave yeah I could I could push
2551200	2554720	a button in my head that made me want to talk to you about avionics for the next
2554720	2560600	hour and a half I really could but at a certain point my wife might come up and
2560600	2564200	be like really upset that I've been talking about avionics for 90 minutes or
2564200	2571080	I might find out that everybody left the party or I might I might you know I
2571080	2574840	don't know there's a bunch of people I didn't see you know friends of mine and
2574840	2582720	stuff I don't know when every conversation is a a weird fencing match
2582720	2586480	except instead of people trying to stab each other it's like people trying to
2586480	2591560	hug each other and and so you're you can spend an indeterminate amount of time
2591560	2598920	and every single conversation can only really end gracefully or ungracefully by
2598920	2605280	somebody saying well I've decided I'm done talking to you so I'm gonna go talk
2605280	2610280	to someone else which doesn't feel very genuine because it's not practical
2610280	2615680	because it would be better to say well I've enjoyed talking to you but I have
2615680	2619760	to save a kitten from a tree but to say I've enjoyed talking to you but I'm
2619760	2625680	bored now or I want to see if there's someone better to talk to I sort of did
2625680	2628800	that last night I mean that's what we're doing all the time with each other
2628800	2634240	parties and I don't and there's people who know how to handle that gracefully
2634240	2637760	and there and I feel more kinship with Spencer I'm like I feel a little
2637760	2642640	fashion hey I bear back I have to go pee yeah cuz you're the guy that is able
2642640	2646560	to leave you're not the guy that's struggling to not lose at a party you're
2646560	2653320	always winning well I mean I have my own version of anxiety there but like
2653320	2659760	but let's but but just because Jeff said he says I gotta go pee so why can't you
2659760	2664240	and I say I gotta go pee do you lie you don't have to pee that much so you lie
2664240	2672880	leave no I mean conversations right um I'm comfortable saying hey I'll be right
2672880	2675560	back or hey I'm gonna go over and say hi to my friend over there I just saw
2675560	2679480	like I got you are comfortable but that's more key that's that but that's
2679480	2682200	why I wanted to address that because that's not it's not true what you
2682200	2686280	initially said you know no just tell everybody I will say this if you are
2686280	2690680	more comfortable saying the truth which is if I'm being if I'm being cornered by
2690680	2694440	a jerk like you know like like like you're at the drawing room and some guy
2694440	2699240	just won't get off your ass I am very comfortable lying and say oh god I gotta
2699240	2704200	go take a shit I'll be back in four years like I'll say whatever it takes
2704200	2708360	to get away from somebody who's punishing me if they're engaged in a
2708360	2716040	social crime on their own yes they're so drunk yeah depending how little I'm
2716040	2719800	afraid of getting punched or a drink thrown at me I'll just say hey I'm gonna
2719800	2725800	go hang out with other people like I just and just bone the fuck out but the
2725800	2729960	thing that you said Spencer about like pulling up and seeing a crowd like I
2729960	2734600	have my own thing about it's not like oh my god I got to walk through a crowd
2734600	2738520	and everyone's gonna stop me it's not like that it's not like I'm so rad that
2738520	2742280	that's gonna be a bummer but there's times when you just don't want to walk
2742280	2745280	through a crowd and ever you might just want to be able to get from point A to
2745280	2748960	point B without being stopped and you can't be in control of that right like
2748960	2755720	when I do like comedy shows I disappear after the show like I like when we do on
2755720	2759200	the Harman tour and stuff like that when the show's over I usually find a place
2759200	2765120	to be alone like I need that few minutes just to go just to go hide see if church
2765120	2771640	texted you know like just be complete like I don't want to be around the sound
2771640	2781200	of maybe being asked to talk or do a thing but I am a jerk so I am I'm not
2781200	2785560	uncomfortable wearing the black hat if I really have to get out of a situation I
2785560	2791920	don't think it won't pay in this analysis for us to you know like there's
2791920	2797560	no good or bad it's just but it's worth examining because I observe about myself
2797560	2803600	I'm like well if you do a live show and then your Santa Claus there's a line of
2803600	2807000	people it's like Derek there are moments when I feel like this is this is how
2807000	2812240	uncomfortable and the reason is because it's orderly and it requires an
2812240	2817480	introduction and at a at a party I think this is like people it's like like
2817480	2823360	people go like hey how are you like I don't know it's just so freeform it's
2823360	2828680	like orgiastic and I like I start to freak the fuck out and I spend every
2828680	2834160	conversation that I have at a party like I hold my drink like and if it's in a
2834160	2839840	plastic cup as last night it's like it's like the cup splits open very early on
2839840	2843880	because I'm squeezing it and I'm it doesn't matter who I'm talking to it's
2843880	2847920	like because I'm always thinking like what are you supposed to do when is this
2847920	2851000	supposed to end is this going on too long what am I supposed to say am I
2851000	2854920	being a bad person or a good person where's Cody like like wait wait wait
2854920	2859440	what am I doing what am I doing why am I doing this I think maybe I've mentioned
2859440	2864960	this before on the show but like I think a long time ago and you were my friend
2864960	2868080	when this happened I just started wearing suits all the time and I think
2868080	2874280	that's a social cue body armor thing that people tend to leave me a little
2874280	2878160	bit more alone well I think so I get to call the shots on that a little bit well
2878160	2883880	but it also I think that when you get up in the morning because when you
2883880	2891280	commit to being a suit guy even though it seems second nature to you when you
2891280	2896400	get up in the morning like there's there's social laws against leaving your
2896400	2901120	house without a minimum amount of clothing on and Spencer and I are
2901120	2906560	wearing the minimum amount of clothing like we're wearing which means that we
2906560	2911200	actually get up out of bed and we go over to a pile of foam fell who never gave
2911200	2915000	me my goddamn clothes let's not get too distracted but but when I think that
2915000	2922040	that's the I'm pitching I guess the the advantage socially of having a style is
2922040	2927400	because you actually like on Halloween like you you wake up every morning and
2927400	2932400	you you you put an amount of attention you put on a suit of armor and it's not
2932400	2936320	it doesn't have to be about Oh armor protecting the real you from the outside
2936320	2941160	world like that's disingenuous you know it's more about like that's also
2941160	2944680	actually the important thing is that you're saying you're acknowledging every
2944680	2948920	morning that the reason you're leaving your house is to interact with other
2948920	2953600	people and not to put words in your mouth but Spencer and I don't do that
2953600	2958720	we get up out of bed we go the reason I'm leaving my house is because I have
2958720	2963320	to I have an appointment and so I'm gonna put this potato sack on with holes
2963320	2967760	in it for my arms because otherwise I'll get arrested and and that and it
2967760	2971960	casts a kind of paw over the whole thing meanwhile you're going like it's in the
2971960	2975560	way that you use it but also and then every interaction you have there's a
2975560	2983480	little bit of license for you to to be alone to perform there's or or I with a
2983480	2990280	with a with a stern look or you know like well sure there's that too I can be
2990280	2995120	completely alone in public in a suit I can also like I said before my
2995120	2998920	impression to myself is everybody can have everyone's attention please leave me
2998920	3004040	alone and that's like I get up everybody look at me now fucking shut up and I
3004040	3007880	want to like I bring earplugs wherever I go because I like to read in public
3007880	3011080	which is self-destructive and stupid because I'm always mad that people are
3011080	3015640	talking it's like why did you just get an armchair and read at home yeah I guess
3015640	3019500	I'm kind of said also though that when I go over to my pile of 800 Rick and
3019500	3023060	Morty t-shirts and my three pants that do or don't fit depending on how many
3023060	3027900	Twinkies I've had that year like I always have the swirling thoughts in my
3027900	3032740	head about whether or not I care whether or not people like the way I look and
3032740	3040100	all this stuff and you cut through that before you enter the world because you
3040100	3046260	are formalizing you're getting dressed you're going I'm going out into the
3046260	3050580	world and when I'm going out to the world I'm an ambassador of my selfness
3050580	3055500	to the otherness and so that means that if someone comes up to me and says hey
3055500	3061700	man you want to buy a potato for a three dollars I don't know what that character
3061700	3066500	is I don't know what ratio I'm sorry for all the emails I'm gonna get that must
3066500	3071820	be a good potato a three dollar potato we added an article to dollars but that
3071820	3076740	you can not only because it's not it is it's part armor part performance all the
3076740	3082060	stuff it's like a when we talk when we do me on these ads and we talk about the
3082060	3086660	first decision you make when you get out of bed is are you gonna put on cotton
3086660	3091860	underwear that are like oh I gotta protect my nuts from my own pants or are
3091860	3098380	you gonna sheath them in glorious microb and all which actually says to you the
3098380	3103340	important person to say it too I love my nuts being cradled and yeah I didn't
3103340	3108100	mean for that synergy to happen right there's these we've talked about it
3108100	3111260	before I'm sure that there's two great books by Quentin Crisp one's called
3111260	3116180	doing it with style and one's called how to have a lifestyle and it's about what
3116180	3121060	is style and personal style doesn't mean fashion it doesn't mean money it doesn't
3121060	3126620	mean sex it doesn't mean power it's self-knowledge how you're carrying
3126620	3131940	yourself to other people to have a camera on yourself like I'm sure I'm
3131940	3135860	repeating myself but it's Quentin Crisp said someone asked him what is style and
3135860	3142260	he said style is being yourself only on purpose right and so that takes a level
3142260	3148260	like you can be homeless with style you can be it doesn't have to be fancy pants
3148260	3152980	like it's simply who you are like Spencer you have style you know I got
3152980	3157220	style you you have so much style that that nine people can show up at a
3157220	3160340	Halloween party dressed as you and everyone goes oh fuck we're all
3160340	3168220	Spencer's today it's like aesthetically terrible but like you you like when you
3168220	3173060	on Harmon quest pop out of the the wilderness wearing your lumberjack shirt
3173060	3180660	and your shorts like you you're impersonatable right because I think
3180660	3187740	it's absolutely okay and for me beneficial to have a uniform like it I
3187740	3191540	have a lot of clothes in my place and I don't wear any of them I wear my suits I
3191540	3196780	wear my black shoes I wear my dress shirts and then I've got a million
3196780	3200700	t-shirts that I wear at home and then if I the only time I'm ever not in a suit
3200700	3205940	I'm wearing one other outfit and I just realized like one day is like I'm sick of
3205940	3210380	picking fucking clothes out in the morning like for me I just want to make
3210380	3214660	sure that the dry cleaner like like the stuff that I know I'm gonna want that
3214660	3222100	week is ready to go and my closet is like Einstein's basically it's just a
3222100	3226780	bunch of blue and gray suits and a lot of white shirts and I find that really
3226780	3232620	relaxing I that's something I don't want to spend time really thinking about as
3232620	3238660	much as I like clothes I don't want to think about variety I just like a nice
3238660	3243220	dark suit with a white shirt and black shoes right but somebody who's like it's
3243220	3248020	the t-shirt culture which we all live in like t-shirts once upon a time were like
3248020	3253140	underwear and now they've become a thing you can put on I feel incredibly nude
3253140	3256380	going to the market in a t-shirt like when it's 900,000 degrees out like it's
3256380	3260340	been for the last couple weeks I feel like I like I'm basically walking to the
3260340	3264900	supermarket like in a bathing suit I think the key is like as I said like my
3264900	3271500	therapist has said like that the new era that we're entering hopefully that it's
3271500	3278100	different that the large theme is unconscious versus conscious and so it's
3278100	3285340	like it's possible to be unconscious and get up in the morning and go like I'm
3285340	3291860	gonna I'm gonna pull this idiocracy shirt from this dispenser and throw it
3291860	3298860	on myself and and that's fine it's like like no one's we're used to the bad guys
3298860	3304580	being people that tell you what you should wear but somewhere in there it's
3304580	3308460	like what all that there's so many things that we don't think about that
3308460	3313100	then we're like worried about and and like for me and Spencer and I suppose
3313100	3319260	probably 99% of our listenership it's like conversations with people small
3319260	3325100	talk like grace tacked square dancing of conversation where you could just go hey

3495060	3500500	respectful and nice and all this shit it's like like I I feel like I was like
3500500	3503980	really high at the Halloween party I was and I really got a good handle on this
3503980	3507500	I was talking to a bunch of other beta males about how like the accountability
3507500	3513140	that we have where it's like it we're emerging into this place now where it's
3513140	3517860	like let's take down the alphas they're so disrespectful they're terrible they
3517860	3523060	do these terrible things and then it's like wait a minute though to the extent
3523060	3530020	that it's every man for himself if you're a beta and you start to panic
3530020	3536740	where you're like oh I think we invented everything that like holds us together I
3536740	3543140	I'm self-identifying with like a sub race of like men that are like I don't
3543140	3549780	want to beat another man's skull in if he looks at my girl from the wrong way I
3549780	3555380	want to have the confidence to prance about the world knowing that I own it
3555380	3560980	because I'm talented because guess what your muscles will get you this far not
3560980	3567460	this far that that is a that's called modern society and I just got this taste
3567460	3573220	of it as in this bar with Cody we had biked from my house to a bar and
3573220	3578900	we're minding our own business I'm 44 goddamn years old like girlfriend is
3578900	3589140	30 fucking two years old we're adults we're just taking our bicycles which by
3589140	3592460	the way every time we stopped at a stoplight whatever there was like a guy
3592460	3597060	who came up to Cody and you know it was like like hey you guys that some kind of
3597060	3601300	biking club it's like like I'm seeing it through all kinds of new eyes like yeah
3601300	3604540	just anything anything that it like licensed you to talk to a girl like you
3604540	3608140	never know like I was just such a ridiculous really what you guys are in a
3608140	3612700	biking club whatever I'm not I don't care like I'm not I'm not like fucking
3612700	3615220	stop talking to my girlfriend but it's like I'm just looking at it your new
3615220	3619060	eyes seeing it where I'm like I'm like seeing it now it's it's it's it's
3619060	3623420	luminol right it's our like fecal fecal detector like a blacklight and I'm seeing
3623420	3629580	like common shit everywhere there you go go to the we go to this bar and like I
3629580	3635180	like like let's take photos of each other sitting at the bar holding
3635180	3641740	cocktails with her biker helmet on like fun so she takes a picture of me and
3641740	3647060	she's the lighting is such that she should take my stool takes picture I
3647060	3651220	stand back taking a couple pictures of Cody she's got her helmet on she's
3651220	3655700	holding a cocktail adjusting I want to be good want to be good for Instagram
3655940	3663860	this guy like goes like excuse me like it's just like like commands it's like
3663860	3669660	commands my space and goes like excuse me I'm sorry can I can I help you
3669660	3676420	with this photo oh boy and I so let's go back to this after the whole story
3676420	3680700	after the whole interaction plays out and and you tell me what I should do
3680700	3684860	when and where but alright I got it all loaded up here's here's here's what I
3684860	3692980	don't do at that moment I don't go no fuck off that's what you should and the
3692980	3699580	reason I don't do it at that moment is because I don't assume that what's
3699580	3706940	about to happen is going to happen right I I think that I'm in Hollywood and he's
3706940	3711740	a DP like like that that like if that it would be my male ego that would make
3711740	3716540	me go fuck you don't shut up and that actually this is how you make new
3716540	3721660	friends this is how you have a good time this is why you came to a bar this is
3721660	3727900	why this is my overall my experience like someone from your community says hey
3727900	3731780	you live in Los Angeles I noticed trying to take a picture here I I work for
3731780	3735780	fucking Bruckheimer I don't like I died I'll make it look like a goddamn
3735780	3740900	Transformers movie if you move this candle he said can I help sorry can I
3740900	3744860	help like you know like like like came in with this thing and my reflexive
3744860	3749940	response I insist because I'm a good person it was was was yeah yeah yeah
3749940	3755660	yeah and he instead of taking my camera now he moves forward because he's on the
3755660	3760740	move and he's moving past me and he's moving over to Cody and he and and so
3760740	3767780	now it's too late it's like like his his suggestion of how to make the
3767780	3775100	picture better is he wants to take the biker helmet that's on her head and turn
3775100	3783180	it backwards which by the way doesn't make it look any different that's the
3783180	3787980	kind of suggestion you'd hear from the kind of person who would suggest it a
3787980	3792420	bar to help you take a photo yeah that's strange well except that there
3792420	3797980	might I would I would argue with you either for the sake of my pride or for
3797980	3803460	the sake of humanity's defense I would say that honestly Spencer it like like
3803460	3811020	it sometimes if not most of the time a stranger who says can I suggest
3811020	3814580	something can I offer something can I help you can I can improve your life
3814580	3819580	actually like it's it's kind of like if you don't if you resist the urge to
3819580	3824580	plant it of the apes them that it it actually turns out to be fine right I
3824580	3833580	guess I'm reading too much into the tone of voice he used I'm just the honestly
3833580	3837180	the tone of voice if that's how someone wants to help that's not okay to help I
3837180	3841700	want yeah let's stop there and reset because that's actually making it very
3841700	3844980	clear that it's important that I actually try to do a realistic
3844980	3851100	impression of the guy okay and I'm gonna try it like I it agonizes me to try it
3851100	3856420	because I'm reliving trauma sorry you guys but like I like I guess my best
3856420	3865420	impression would be like hey can I make a suggestion here or like hey hey can I
3865420	3869340	help you with this photo or it's now that sounds rapey too I just like I
3869340	3872980	didn't it sounded like sounded normal hey can I touch your girlfriend's face
3872980	3879620	real quick I didn't and so it so then yeah he turns the hat backwards and I'm
3879620	3887460	like are you fucking kidding me and I don't now I'm holding a camera while
3887460	3893380	three feet from me this guy like a first of all now the first fuck you is on a
3893380	3898380	human level because it's just oh can I just do a different thing than you were
3898380	3903340	doing I fucking I and and and women who are listening are gonna be like do you
3903340	3906260	think this is like this is the whole problem I'm like yes yes it is the whole
3906260	3910140	problem because yes the same thing that made him want to do it whatever level he
3910140	3914020	thought he wanted to do it on I all I just want our now I want to beat his
3914020	3918380	brains and I want to fucking pride him because I'm like you never ever ever
3918380	3923060	wanted to help do anything and this is before sexuality gets into it he could
3923060	3926700	be gay for all I know I still want to beat his brains in because he's a fucking
3926700	3931580	weird like fucking like he's just a person that wants to fuck with shit and
3931580	3935700	you and I didn't enter that agreement with him I took him at his word that he
3935700	3939500	wanted it and now he's just doing bullshit to just change shit and piss on
3939500	3944340	it this is before now the next thing that happens is because he put it fucking
3944340	3951540	he puts her hat on backwards now well guess what her hair is different now now
3951540	3957620	he has to stroke her face and move her hair out of the way as I'm holding a
3957620	3962660	camera three feet from my girlfriend in broad daylight in a bar while a man that
3962660	3967900	didn't beat me up that never said I'm a bigger man than you I choose to
3967900	3975100	challenge you well just is making me watch him touch stroke my girlfriend's
3975100	3981020	face while he dictates the terms of my photograph what am I supposed to do
3981020	3986540	how is a modern man supposed to deal with this shit like like because the
3986540	3995060	beta male like who I am a member of the the way we dealt with it before was well
3995060	4000660	I own everything and and and ask your friends and like this behavior like I
4000660	4004620	go ahead and follow your urges but if it pisses me off you're not gonna get
4004620	4009100	hired a lot I are you're not gonna get a loan at that bank I own like I I make
4009100	4012660	Rick and Morty and all this stuff but it's like in these tiny micro moments
4012660	4017500	and also assuming if we're not gonna go with hierarchy as a measurement of how
4017500	4023180	you should treat women if in other words beta males are controlling like how
4023180	4030020	alphas treat women because we own alphas do we have to like have
4030020	4036780	accountability and go okay now that the zoo is loose like oh so I don't own
4036780	4042660	alphas and I don't own women do I have to get in a fight with this guy what do
4042660	4048260	I have to like learn how do I just go to bars less do I have to like so what
4048260	4053260	happened nothing just trauma I mean he fucking he was done as soon as he
4053260	4057020	stroked my girlfriend's face with his smelly fingers which I'm sure smelled
4057020	4062500	better than mine I did like like like he got what he wanted he was gone he didn't
4062500	4066500	it wasn't like a movie where he's gonna keep doing it before you stop him he did
4066540	4073140	what he wanted and he walked away he did that to maybe eight people and maybe one
4073140	4077220	of the women like like what I don't know what his game is he did it and he
4077220	4081900	walked away and that man's name is mayor Richard Reardon I was gonna say Steve's
4081900	4087540	on but yeah that's fucked up you do you got the camera you just you just take I
4087540	4090500	should have taken a fucking thousand pictures of him yeah I've been like this
4090500	4093540	guy had a lot of opinions about my girlfriend they point the camera right
4093540	4098380	where his dick is like you get them to go take it out and I know and you have
4098380	4103260	the confidence to do that and I froze like what what what how long do I have
4103260	4108380	to wait for this guy to go away what what how how do I get back to my comfort
4108380	4114220	zone which is not me hiding from him but is me owning everything that's the
4114220	4118580	important thing like how do I get back to my comfort zone where I'm King shit
4118580	4122500	not where I'm hiding in a bush the Cody was Cody uncomfortable and freaked out
4122500	4126740	by this like how did she she hated it she hated it and you can see in the
4126740	4130740	photo that there's a photo of her with a backwards bike helmet I wear her face is
4130740	4139060	crimson yuck and she's forcing a smile and she looks great because women deal
4139060	4144060	with that all the time and they just and and the photos taken by a fucking cuck
4144060	4149620	who just watched wait is that the photo where her hair looks perfect and her
4149620	4155420	hat is on backwards yeah amazing my favorite photo looks ridiculous and she
4155420	4160760	looks fucking like purple and it's and and and every time I look at my own bike
4160760	4166820	helmet my dick shrivels up into my abdomen and and and I like I don't I
4166820	4170580	just like these are new questions that are gonna emerge if we're gonna be good
4170580	4175460	men if we're gonna also say because we can't just say hey don't jerk off into
4175460	4181260	potted plant blocker door with like that that you know what this society
4181260	4186700	starts with guys that can't throw a spear as hard saying yeah but I can type
4186700	4191500	a funnier joke than you and it and and and then that that translates into like
4191500	4194980	hierarchy so it's like I think there might be a little bit of like I need to
4194980	4200900	learn how to punch a dude in the fucking face verbally or be as gallant as you
4200900	4206380	or it's like like like like oh you would I know that you you you you spent 20
4206380	4210500	years before you finally got headbutted in there your nose broke but like there
4210500	4217580	was 20 years of you having recourse to masculinity I like I like like I have to
4217580	4221420	learn it's like to recognize that and then like react it's like my adrenaline
4221420	4226900	just froze me I'm like this dude is just like oh oh he's just touching my
4226900	4230460	girlfriend's face and then in the time for it faster than it takes me to even
4230460	4236420	think that he's done it took this long it took that long mm-hmm what am I
4236420	4243420	supposed to do cut that off halfway hey get back here hey mister I what am I
4243420	4247380	supposed to do yeah timing is always gonna be hard because it's never gonna
4247380	4250820	be the perfect timing you're never gonna make it in time you're never gonna hit
4250820	4255380	it right in the middle it's always gonna be too late I mean obviously hindsight
4255380	4259220	2020 right so it's not like you did anything wrong I spent the last 23 years
4259220	4262860	calling everybody I thought it was a cunt a cunt and this one cunt punched me
4262860	4266720	in the fucking nose and broke my timing like what we have infinite timing now
4266720	4270260	what I would have said I would have said hey man you don't touch a woman without
4270260	4278460	her consent oh damn I mean you gave him permission to help with a picture right
4278460	4281980	you certainly didn't give her permission anyone permission to touch a woman right
4281980	4286300	right she didn't give him so but in real so you would you would say that you know
4286980	4290660	if I were a superhero that's what I would have done if I were in with your if
4290660	4294420	you're a superhuman not a superhero if you were a superhuman if you had
4294420	4299420	suppose a natural it no if you could move faster than human reflex no would
4299420	4305140	say it as his fingers touched her face right or afterwards oh okay well it's so
4305140	4309940	that really should we do that yeah he does and now he's gone and go hey man
4309940	4314860	yeah hey yeah yeah that's not it's that's the thing the timings not gonna
4314860	4320140	like it's like what's going on sounds like someone wants everything that's
4320140	4326100	going normally to stop hey mr. hey you don't treat a lady like that you hear
4326100	4331300	and then Cody if she's worth her salt is gonna go it's okay it's fine please
4331300	4337100	don't protract this trauma please don't do right it's when someone abuses the
4337100	4342180	system and subverts the rule of law to make everyone uncomfortable there's not
4342180	4348260	really a way to just I'm sorry no one person uncomfortable versus the 40
4348260	4352380	people I'd make uncomfortable by calling them out right but the world is
4352380	4356940	uncomfortable by this stuff it's it's not it's not supposed to be comfortable
4356940	4361780	the balance was upset when he touched someone you know that was that was what
4361780	4365460	through and then everyone else has to make the decision to either be cool or
4365460	4369100	not be cool but that's because of him it's not like I mean obviously it is a
4369100	4372500	decision you're making but it's not the decision that you were forced to make it
4372500	4377660	was a decision that he forced on you by breaking the balance and you know
4377660	4382660	disrespecting personal boundaries yeah and to me the tragedy is so three weeks
4382660	4387900	from now I'm gonna be taking a picture of my girlfriend and like Michelle
4387900	4391800	Gondry is gonna come up or the next Michelle Gondry is gonna go actually
4391800	4394660	they're gonna notice that I'm like backlighting her when I could be like
4394660	4398580	hey can I help you with this photo and I'm gonna go fuck you fuck you you
4398580	4405020	fucking rapist like why don't you what or no I'm exaggerating like like like
4405020	4410740	for real like he comes out hey can I help and I go how how because that would
4410740	4414380	be an appropriate response given how that guy behave or how are you gonna
4414380	4418600	help well yeah like like I have to scrutinize every single interaction I
4418600	4423220	have I can't just in spite of how much energy it takes for me to treat people
4423220	4427260	normally you know when I go out in public and it's like it's already hard
4427260	4433100	for me to like to have people walk away from an interaction with me not going
4433100	4437780	that guy's an asshole like so I have like reflexes that I've like programmed
4437780	4443580	on top yeah everybody does that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
4443580	4446780	whatever you want whatever you want yeah and then it's like okay so then you're
4446780	4449860	going whatever you want this is like fucking predators that are like like

4463160	4466820	living through that right now we are I mean you keep hearing these new
4466820	4471220	directors these new personalities being accused it's not shit it's not
4471220	4476460	comfortable I wanted to commit to it being on my shirt but I poured vodka on
4476460	4480580	my shirt and I I didn't want it to get on my phone that's a different matter
4480580	4487860	entirely speaking of different matters entirely Spencer what do you think about
4487860	4492500	giving us a big long recap of D&D because it's been a long time since I've
4492500	4496980	been around yeah and played you want it you and D you want to do a little uh
4496980	4507660	what's happening play that that's Dan singing so good I guess that I don't know
4507660	4517300	that's ho hoser nice do you really name your band hoser if you're like who's it

4522900	4528700	take off a hoser all right sorry anyways I don't know I thought like but it's not
4528700	4532660	comfortable it's it's what you know remember and it doesn't happen to me that
4532660	4536780	much but I bet it happens to a lot of fucking people yeah all the time
4536900	4542380	it does I created Rick and Morty and that shit happened to me at sunset and
4542380	4548540	sunset like in in full view of every hipster wearing gauzy t-shirt like this
4548540	4552620	shit like like if you're if you're listening and you constantly feel
4552620	4559740	worried that like your masculinity is being like impugned like our challenge
4559740	4564860	like the important thing is like I think that's how this all started so now now
4564860	4569460	like now let's let's reboot and like figure out a way through these moments
4569460	4575540	together where we don't take the course we took six thousand years ago where we
4575540	4580300	went you know what enough is enough from now on if you love a man and you're
4580300	4583100	gonna have babies with him you need to sign this contract and any guy that
4583100	4586540	fucks here is a criminal and he gets hung from the highest tree like because
4586540	4592700	I'm talented and I bring more meat into this cave like like we we as a tribe
4592700	4599260	meaning we as the the male that doesn't want to I don't know like like like we
4599260	4605700	started this we I'm I want to know what I do as an individual I want to be
4605700	4610540	Humphrey Bogart the next time some dude from some chode fucking like disrespects
4610540	4618740	my space my my my girlfriends like privacy and agency like in public I want
4618740	4624820	to have like a foolproof response that doesn't make me a a dick yeah it's hard
4624820	4629660	to do like very early on like dating church we were at some restaurant and
4629660	4635460	some asshole like bumped our table and knocked shit all over us and was not
4635460	4643540	cool about it and he was you know just a dick and I really made a scene and she
4643540	4649020	was just like fucking don't do that like like don't like I didn't let it go
4649020	4654140	it wasn't making things better I escalated shit and she's just like
4654140	4661380	fucking don't ever do that again and like I wanted instant justice and you're
4661380	4664460	not gonna get it from that fucking asshole it's gonna be a woman's worst
4664460	4667860	nightmare not to mansplain what that is but it's got to be like there's got to
4667860	4672220	be a highway cone where they're like well yeah I'd be nice if if there was a
4672220	4677020	but no you're yeah but this is my worst nightmare now I have two Visigoths like
4677020	4680980	like I'm always the thing of saying something that hurts the person's
4680980	4685620	feelings as they walk away that's that's not very healthy and once it got my
4685620	4691500	nose broken so I mean the truth is and I like a perfectly natural primate
4691500	4695580	society look I don't know there's eight billion other dudes if they all wanted
4695580	4699580	to gang up with me and beat me up they can have all my shit so then we have
4699580	4703700	capitalism then we have politics then we have government so like we all wake
4703700	4706300	up every day in a world where they're like you're not allowed to climb in my
4706300	4709820	window and have what I have I didn't put in a spirit gum on this beard and it's
4709820	4714060	coming up because I'm laughing too much and now my fucking beard's popping up
4714060	4719460	and I'm like what kind of commander we're all laughing too much we're all
4719460	4724780	laughing too much uh anyways we were about to I think segue into maybe D&D I
4724780	4730260	think D&D but I do like might whereas usually where we segue into D&D and then
4730260	4734940	we keep on dispenser we go like okay now quickly do a recap as part of the D&D
4734940	4744900	segment we I think it might help Spencer if we identify a pre D&D period
4744900	4748900	before we start playing D&D where we where we figure out what the fuck
4748900	4752660	happened yes no no I'm saying I because it's not on him because you guys played
4752660	4755540	once I think when I wasn't here and we haven't played walk as you weren't here
4755540	4759260	Spencer like it seems like it's been a couple months since I played D&D I think
4759260	4763820	you're at the last one was I I don't fuck we turn on emissions we've all got
4763820	4768900	license to not know what the hell yeah let's before I do the role of the music
4768900	4774540	Spencer like do you have the sheets in the flim flam yeah yeah handles out
4774540	4780800	because we have loads of time right now and let's get this at least back up in
4780800	4784100	the air while he gets that stuff out let's do a little bit of podcast
4784100	4788720	business because we're like let's be transparent about this we moved from the
4788720	4792680	venue where we had a live audience into this place and then we're like we had a
4792680	4796440	discussion tonight where we like pulled up the numbers of like like who's
4796440	4800680	listening when and who's you know like and it looks like well I mean there's a
4800680	4803720	million ways to look at a million different numbers but like there's an
4803720	4812720	indication that this transition is costing us like people's faith that
4812720	4816720	there's that the upset is like we've cracked the whip here whether it's
4816720	4819880	people thinking that the podcast is over and not and they don't have
4819880	4822880	communication that the podcast is continuing or whether it's people that
4822880	4827080	genuinely hate this format and don't know it'll ever end like who knows
4827080	4831720	there's a million variables but we did talk a lot tonight yeah what we I think
4831720	4835040	what we kind of came to the agreement on is that we don't know what's going on
4835040	4838120	we don't know when the space will be back when the space is back we don't
4838120	4842400	know exactly what that's going to look like we don't we don't want it to be us
4842400	4847880	doing a booth podcast like this forever yeah that's not the permanent this
4847880	4851880	doesn't represent our dream this isn't our fantasy but then you would say well
4851880	4855560	what is your dream what is your fantasy and we would say we're not sure I don't
4855560	4860720	think that whatever we were doing before represented me thinking we were nailing
4860720	4865480	it which is why maybe for me it's it's easier to go oh fuck it we're doing it
4865480	4869840	from this booth from now on viva la difference and maybe people are going
4869840	4879760	what the fuck because you died but but I all I can say is we're open to anything
4879760	4886480	internally we're going to try to like we're working on getting the venue back
4886480	4892000	up that's not because we think that the show should be what it was before we
4892000	4898920	also don't think this is ideal we don't know what the fuck we're doing we we
4898920	4903960	want like we we're talking about maybe like we'll go around California and do
4903960	4912720	like crazy like pop-up shows because a that'll be fun like like because we'll
4912720	4916040	have an audience for that there's there's ways to make the VO booth
4916040	4924080	version of the show more like worth fucking listening to live I don't know
4924080	4928400	but after you left that conversation actually it's not really the
4928400	4932000	subscribership that's in trouble it's actually the crazy thing is maybe a
4932000	4935200	totally organic thing which is that the people listening to the free version of
4935200	4940840	the podcast it's just plummeted after we transitioned which is just like an
4940840	4945720	earthquake it's like well we our show got canceled and there was no
4945720	4950240	communication about you know why because that one gift that Jane posted it was
4950240	4954800	the fuck it was Jane yeah she fucking took it she fucking took it all down I
4954800	4958080	was hoping that we could mention her tonight in the tonight's show because I
4958080	4968880	definitely did want to continue a insane cycle of whether or not yeah I don't I
4968880	4975480	definitely was hoping hand Steve and I are character she alright the the
4975480	4980840	dispensing of the character sheets is happening yeah alright so Spencer I'm
4980840	4985720	woefully unprepared and apparently don't have my dice or my laptop so both my
4985720	4990760	laptop is on my phone and my dice is gonna be on my phone phone dice alright
4990760	4994200	but we didn't talk at all about what had happened we're gonna we're gonna get to
4994200	5001000	the bottom of this right now just let me just say that being good in 2017 it's
5001000	5003720	not always gonna be comfortable and we're not always gonna do the right
5003720	5010400	thing but it's always gonna be the wrong thing to just go oh that sucks yeah I'll
5010400	5014760	deal with it later you know what yeah we've been doing this podcast for a
5014760	5018960	long time we've had a lot of fun it's never been perfect it's very lazy and
5018960	5026640	fly-by-night but we want the people listening to know that this we are all
5026640	5032160	committed to finding out what the new better version of this is and we're
5032160	5037880	gonna do it I was talking about sexual assault oh oh well no that's come on
5037880	5046720	that's that's just gonna happen right all right I know it's it's I mean it's
5046720	5058680	it's true though bark boxes in your character she I had a conversation with
5058680	5061920	my therapist that I thought was so fucking fascinating because we've been
5061920	5065400	she's been I think she may be using me as a case study because I'm like a
5065400	5070400	straight white male and like this shit is like in the psychological community
5070400	5076800	this movement that's happening right now people should know maybe that this
5076800	5081840	is measurable and it is a real movement because the people who get paid $200 a
5081840	5086440	session to talk to you about what's fucking you up they're all talking about
5086440	5090760	it and these are snobs who do not normally pay attention to what you're
5090760	5095320	talking about they do not care they dismiss it as like pockets of this that
5095320	5099640	and it has disrupted their entire practice it has disrupted their calendar
5099640	5104120	of how you're going to self-actualize and what and how couples interact
5104120	5109320	particularly the Weinstein thing couples therapists are experiencing this flood
5109320	5116720	of women in couples saying yeah well here are my assaults and the man and the
5116720	5121400	couple going I didn't know that and then you go from there into a Yahtzee game or
5121400	5125480	into a fucking like Candyland game of like you don't know like because no
5125480	5129560	one's ever communicated about it and everything has gone insane and I think
5129560	5134720	for that reason maybe my therapist is kind of fascinated with my like kind of
5134720	5140360	like my point of view like what's going on with it and I had like I almost came
5140360	5144560	it like whatever we should play D&D I don't want to I feel like I feel like me
5144560	5148760	talking about the stuff is why our subscribers went away or listeners I
5148760	5152720	think nothing is more helpful than four men talking about women's issues well
5152720	5162600	that's a dumb cheap shot like we're all right about everything I mean I had a
5162600	5167640	conversation with my therapist about what I was experiencing as a man about
5167640	5174560	all this stuff and she was telling me as a gay person like what it what how it
5174560	5179760	works being like feeling like you're part of a demographic that is under a
5179760	5186040	microscope and a thing that was crazy to me was what she taught she talked
5186040	5189960	about like well you know like when gay rights are like violated or when when
5189960	5193840	things are coming up in the news like some kid gets like handcuffed to a fence
5193840	5199200	and beaten because he's gay or something her explaining to me that there's like
5199200	5203880	this fear as a gay person an individual gay person is reading the newspaper
5203880	5209240	reads that story that beyond any outrage beyond any like anything that there's
5209240	5216080	like this weird shame that creeps in where it's like oh are they it's not
5216080	5219480	like are they coming for me next or maybe I shouldn't be gay it's just sort
5219480	5223840	of like when are they gonna stop looking at me when are they gonna stop paying
5223840	5228600	attention to me right like like and I was like I was so overwhelmed with her
5228600	5231720	characterization of it where I was like I was like oh man you know what I don't I
5231720	5236480	don't think I ever understood that I don't I think that everybody just
5236480	5240720	intellectualizes like this stuff because it gets reduced to like this
5240720	5245960	like Stratego game of like oh I understand your outrage I understand
5245960	5249920	your anger I understand unfairness you work for this you should get that but
5249920	5253440	like we're not communicating about the thing that we could all relate to which
5253440	5257560	is like holy fuck I hope nobody kicks my fucking ass next I hope nobody fucking
5257560	5261720	comes for me I hope I hope I didn't make a bad choice did I make a choice should
5261720	5265460	I be gay what's going on like I don't know like because it's not prideful they
5265460	5270060	don't have gay fear parades they don't have it's like it's not right it's not a
5270060	5273180	right way to express anything and yet it's something we all share like you
5273180	5278340	worry about it and I was burst into tears because I was like I didn't know I
5278340	5283900	didn't know you guys felt that way I didn't I only understood that you'd be
5283900	5288940	angry you know I didn't I didn't know that you'd be like ashamed I didn't know
5288940	5291980	that you'd react to a story in a paper of somebody getting gay-bashed with
5291980	5297580	shame I thought you'd react with anger and fear but not shame and I think that
5297580	5305620	like anyways all right that's been our show thanks for okay so we're in a
5305620	5309980	forest and the fucking goblin attacked us whatever what oh no you fucking Nazi
5309980	5314460	we had a whole episode after that all right where were we all right take me
5314460	5318980	way back Spence please if you don't mind I'm sorry to call you Spence that really
5318980	5322540	I call him spinny I started calling him spinny spinny he probably loves that in
5322540	5327620	texts spent spending do you like you like that's one of several competing
5327620	5334340	theories I'm honestly trying to remember what happened you know Barkbox will send
5334340	5342860	you a box of we went to close we went to placeholder and then we turned in our
5342860	5349100	mission and the captain of the of our police force kind of base we had a
5349100	5354660	meeting with them well yeah that was the most recent so if that's all you want
5354660	5359780	no hope for sure okay so here's what happened you finished your mission
5359780	5364340	that's what I pointed out no I know I know I'm sure sharing oh it's at the
5364340	5373740	camera sorry I'm sorry sorry I do a lot of drugs these days these days is it
5373740	5377420	because you feel sad about something that's beyond the cheese stain it's no
5377420	5385220	well I mean I'm sure it is but really I'm just trying to remember forget about
5385220	5392420	the cheese stain so we'll catch Steven figures I wasn't mansplaining I was
5392420	5396220	talking about a personal you got you got kind of teared up to well you kind
5396220	5402300	of high-roaded me I was I'm not like one of those guys I'm not I'm special no but
5402300	5405940	like I'm not saying it's not worthwhile talking about but a bunch of guys
5405940	5408620	talking about women's issues it's like that's all that's happening I'm not
5408620	5412460	talking about women's issues I'm talking yeah whatever but yeah no no I was I was
5412460	5417900	doing exactly what you said I was taking a cheap shot and I I cop to that well
5417900	5421340	when you're not around and you don't take those cheap shots this show descends
5421340	5425620	into garbage so you must be doing something right yeah I mean I wasn't
5425620	5428540	gonna point it out but maybe they're the ratings dipped when I wasn't here yeah I
5428540	5433700	mean it point of fact that's what happened the question is yeah and also
5433700	5437460	the stock market kept going up after Trump was elected we need to look at
5437460	5441500	this stuff closer you could have been part of the shrub boost do you have any
5441500	5445900	idea how hard it is to maintain my composure when I know there's not enough
5445900	5449700	spirit gum on this fucking beard and it's popping and flopping it it looks
5449700	5455340	fine from most angles yeah yeah if you're at that angle it starts no I get
5455340	5459340	it most people aren't gonna be you and you at that I got a party to go to where
5459340	5463060	I have to be a character that nobody knows who I am three people saw the
5463060	5467540	the Scrabble box last night and laughed that was three out of a thousand maybe
5467540	5472340	not as many people watch that show no no or it's been too long now it's all
5472340	5479420	about those stranger things all right okay we still have time yeah yeah loads
5479420	5482540	of time all right Spencer do you want to just do a recap or should I give you
5482540	5486460	music how do you feel about this whatever I'm gonna give you music because
5486460	5496460	I like continuity there's a bug go away it's the whole thing's a blackout you're
5496460	5501180	in a bucket right now no no no why maybe I feel like a lot of my life has been a
5501180	5510140	blackout less five years maybe you should stop drinking Steve I know last
5510140	5517020	time and a undetermined amount of times before that our heroes were doing a
5517020	5522140	mission oh boy they exercised a child and then they saved that child from a
5522140	5526980	priest that was trying to exercise the child they took the priest into custody
5526980	5531820	custody where they were gonna take him back to the home base and you know what
5531820	5537300	happened assassins happened they came in and they stabbed up pachins and they
5537300	5543300	stabbed up diarrhea jr. and the prior ran away he was your captive and he ran
5543300	5548340	away oh boy the assassins ran away and it turned out they had a powerful gem
5548340	5553140	that pachins owned and he was just besides himself with rage that it was
5553140	5558420	allowed to be taken from him you met up with this guy called Geffen and he gave
5558420	5562780	you back the prior and and you guys went back to the home base where you turned
5562780	5568300	in the mission and pachins went to talk to the people and the prior went to talk
5568300	5573160	to the people and you told pachins you'd meet him at a local tavern after the
5573160	5578620	meeting the captain said you can turn in your mission papers with Zelie at the
5578620	5583340	commissary to get paid brother Absalom was looking at you brother Absalom you
5583340	5587300	met and he gave you an orangutan ball
5588020	5592660	there was an umber hole but it was non-canon
5593500	5596780	hell yeah
5598780	5604460	okay I have questions about the that's a great way to start off anyone have
5604460	5607780	questions was the orangutan thing or was that when you first ran back into
5607940	5614680	pure burn abby you met brother Absalom and he he was like yo what up and then
5614680	5618300	you were like weren't you working on that thing to get us not have to sign
5618300	5621660	all this paperwork and he was like yeah here you go here's an orangutan ball it
5621660	5626140	summons an orangutan all right and was that at that time did we regard that as
5626140	5632140	a random response it it seemed like the kind of thing that was someone trying to
5632140	5638420	yes and an improv you made right okay fair enough all right so we're off to
5638420	5642140	skull and bone the bar right to go talk to pachins or something like that yeah
5642140	5647900	and to be clear so my drunken question is so we didn't get like a new mission
5647900	5652460	from anybody we're like done and we're in a flux here not yet although you had
5652460	5656300	been told that you could collect your paycheck in that brother Absalom had
5656300	5661420	been looking for you oh let's go get our paycheck then where do we find you

5685980	5691500	hotel shit it's like useful kind of I was your commissary was like a synonymous
5691500	5696220	with cafeteria yeah it's also like a store in a place where you can buy goods

6072460	6077840	we speak of no I examine the bar to look around to see if I can see a pachins you don't see
6077840	6081900	pachins I picture him as looking by the way exactly like Podrick from Game of Thrones
6081900	6090300	that's what I picture okay that's a good idea but that's like white rights like why
6090300	6096620	why couldn't that role go to an Asian listen to my other podcast waiting wands to find
6096620	6103140	out the answer Stu what's how'd you lose your intestines I'm concerned about this
6103140	6108780	I might have Crohn's disease all right all right but in this world it's the result of
6108780	6118980	a real crone I was cursed by an actual crone all right well I mean it's it's not a big
6118980	6124180	place and I look around for patches no he should be here I mean if he was here we'd
6124180	6129380	see him wait a minute do I see I look I look around is there anything else that might
6129380	6139100	catch a gnome druids eye this is great for dice we don't have a yeah I'm like as he's
6139100	6145020	rolling with his phone like I don't have a right to accept to expect that he would meet

6546660	6550340	on all the horrible things that have happened to you because we've entered your life
6551140	6557540	if you um either way whether you want to want us to help you out or not I want to give you
6557540	6564340	my slingshot to help you on your journey with or without us awesome you got to let me know now
6564340	6573380	because I got to get my buds my best buds listen I appreciate your help it hasn't been very helpful
6574180	6580100	I'm gonna leave you guys deal with the results of your actions all right well take my slingshot
6580420	6588660	so you can always remember us all right okay I go back to the skull and bone we he he tells us
6588660	6594420	what just happened and we have a little powwow is does that wait a minute no come on I want it
6594420	6600340	I want him to tell us okay hey uh hey how'd it go did you find patches what's going on hey guys
6601460	6607620	you know break it down for us I talked to I went back and then the I got yelled at
6607620	6613300	patches what you found patches I found patches in a corner and he was really scared corner of
6613300	6620340	what just the corner of the commissary and and he was just he really doesn't want anything to do
6620340	6627540	with us anymore so I gave him my slingshot and I told him he didn't want help he definitely did not
6627540	6635140	want our help uh cool so you said would you like our help and he said no yeah and he was he didn't
6635140	6641220	say anything passive aggressive like well you haven't helped that much so far or you've your
6641220	6645460	help hasn't turned out that good yeah something a passive aggressive people say where they really
6645460	6652580	want you to help he made it abundantly clear that he said no I got this covered I'm totally
6652580	6657220	confident person no no he didn't seem confident right but he also I don't know that we were
6657220	6662180	additive in any way so he seemed like he needed help but also didn't want to owe us anything and
6662180	6668100	just wanted to make us feel guilty and help him I think that he felt more like if we went with him
6668100	6673460	we would royally fuck it up for him like he had better chances without us right because he was
6673460	6680500	doing so good with his artifact by guarding a door yeah if you just sleep in overrun by vampires
6680500	6686420	all right well sounds like should we follow him doesn't sound like it I mean if you told me
6686420	6689700	something different like if you were able to convey nuance to me like that would make it clear
6689700	6694660	that he actually wanted our help well I mean I would say let's go follow him yeah well he was
6694660	6698980	I asked him I was like well what are the stakes and he was like like personally in my life and
6698980	6705220	death but also the whole world right and I feel like you said do you want help and he was like
6705940	6713380	no yeah really that's what's unequivocal about it he said no he didn't say uh from my experience
6713380	6717140	it doesn't seem like you guys hope that much because that would be a different answer I mean
6717140	6721860	he did do that too oh okay he did that too yeah he was which means he did that instead
6721860	6726660	because he can't do both I don't know he can't be definitive and I really got the sense that it
6726660	6731540	wasn't passive aggression he was just very mad and very scared and very upset and really didn't
6731540	6738100	think we were helpful I say fuck it I say fuck him let him do his own thing yeah we're gonna
6738100	6742980	go find passion's gem yeah no I mean not when he's gonna make it difficult to help him I mean I'm
6742980	6748100	not like I'm in this for the ambitious you know glory and stuff but like what did the the the
6748100	6752660	adventure of passion's gem doesn't really sound like well what about no the adventure of passion's
6752660	6758500	gem sounds like an amazing adventure the adventure of convincing passions that he needs help sounds
6758500	6764340	like the first 40 years of my fucking life what if we man who knew too little to him and like we're
6764340	6768660	in this in the shadows and making everything happen and he just thought he was doing something
6768740	6774740	well I I don't think we're talented enough to what do we like the so like he's inspector
6774740	6781140	kuso and we're fate yeah I don't think we've graduated to that level oh look I'm just blue
6781140	6788100	skying here why don't we walk back uh back to the uh to the abbey or wherever we go and talk and see
6788100	6792900	like we need a new mission obviously because we're basically homeless we got 20 gold burning a hole
6792900	6797460	in our pocket but that's a lot we don't need a new mission should we put it all in black hey guys
6797460	6802740	we work for the church militant and we got you know we we have it we took an oath we have a job
6802740	6808020	to do why don't we have this why don't we go back find out to have a new job for us if it sounds
6808020	6815780	less interesting than the than the adventure of passion's gem uh then we take we go we we go
6815780	6821220	shadow passions around I don't think shadowing passions is going to be a realistic option
6821220	6825940	if we wait five more minutes especially who do we talk to about finding a new mission for us
6827700	6830980	brother absalon okay why don't we go back and talk to brother absalon
6831620	6834900	and then we'll tell him about passions and see what he thinks about that
6836820	6842180	I will can I I don't want to be negative nelly but one of the reasons why we didn't bring
6842180	6847380	patches up in the first place is because when we were debriefing pageants made it very clear to me
6847380	6853780	that he doesn't want the church of the silver flame knowing about his ish right
6853780	6860740	right that that was clear so if you care about pageants oh that would have been good to mention
6860740	6864900	the recap that that's that's great that you remember that's accurate though right no no
6864900	6869460	I know that's great I didn't I didn't I let I let patches have his own it was a it was a thing like
6869460	6874180	I I knew that pageants didn't want us talking about because he'd been big trouble with the uh
6874180	6879380	with the church wasn't quite sure but I decided like I like this pageants kid he helped us a lot
6879380	6885300	like if I were up to me I'd like to help him you know I don't know if diarrhea is an unreliable
6885300	6890820	narrator like if I if I heard a kid say if he was like dragging his feet and going like no I don't
6890820	6897220	need any help don't need anybody I'd be like well I'm 40 so I think you do need help and that's cool
6897220	6901700	because when I was 20 that's how I talked to when I needed help but I said that's why I said did he
6901700	6906500	say no or was he a little fucking schlubby about it because if he's schlubby about it let's go chase
6906500	6911780	this kid down and save him from himself maybe I'm just bad with people was he a little schlubby
6911780	6916020	yeah maybe it's a little schlubby his little mealy mouth he's a little like indirect like well
6916020	6920020	basically when it all comes down to it I don't even know yeah yeah all right well let's go get
6920020	6926180	the kid right he's our friend you know what the more I say it because I said it now twice but the
6926180	6934900	more I say the adventure of patch and gem it just it seems like a if I was in a bookstore and I saw
6934900	6942500	that on a book I go I'm fucking don't give that a read it sounds like at least one ingenue is going
6942500	6948260	to get her first kiss in that adventure yeah and maybe it'll be us uh no I don't okay so I'm in
6948260	6953700	other words in that conversation I'm kind of like oh patches that's why I was asking him that stuff
6953700	6959140	I was like did he say no or was he kind of like poopy face about it now I'm like I'm like in the
6959140	6965620	middle of my drink I'm like all right let I want to go find him let's all run out and go see if we
6965620	6970500	can get to the bottom of this with patches we run out to look for patches Spencer all right uh
6970500	6977780	who's got the best perception probably it might be Dan I have a four oh I think it is no I've got
6977780	6983700	11 Jackson my name is Steve I mean diarrhea I called Spencer Jackson because that's because
6983700	6989620	that's what you do when you have 11 perception it as a human I don't have enough perception to
6989620	6995860	find it on my character sheet does that counter your skills it's alphabetical p all right you're
6995860	7006100	looking for patches you don't see him shit three that's not bad okay he's uh he's clearly left the
7006100	7011380	abby the keep the which way was he had it well he's got to be heading toward where the thieves
7011380	7020900	went that direction right what no which way was he headed I didn't really get a good look
7022500	7028420	what do you mean which way was he headed well I did you see him walk off no I left before he did
7028420	7034420	oh great okay where did you see him last right here behind this little bush let's buy him this
7034420	7039380	bush I look around around the bush not a bush you're inside all right I look around inside the
7039380	7048180	bush uh you see it's like a small nook where a short person could hide I'm really scouring
7048180	7053060	on the level that a person without perception could would achieve the results they need to
7053060	7060020	have if he had a high perception um just looking at every fucking inch and centimeter of the area
7060020	7067540	you see uh fingernail marks like someone was digging into it like uh trying to climb up it
7068180	7078260	interesting okay I I just yell patches you do that

7096740	7101140	passions I mean and I think that anyone listening would agree that we did the best we could
