0	7960	Alright, from Dining Typewriter, the Dingleberry, Tall Gold model, from MacArthur Park, Los
7960	8960	Angeles.
8960	18640	My name is Jeff Davis, your comptroller at Harman Town is now in session.
18640	24840	I see Dave Kline down there, can I get a yup from the whole audience?
24840	31840	Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden, your game master extraordinaire.
31840	38840	Spencer, there he is.
38840	50840	It's a good measure, let's welcome the mayor of Harman Town, the eponymous Ben Harman.
51840	56840	Thank you.
56840	65840	Yo, yo, yo, yo, Emmy night, fight for your life, go down the red carpet in the limelight,
65840	70840	celebrate your director and agent that fucked your mama so hard she was hating Christiansen.
70840	76840	Use the dark side of the forest to get in to your mama's pussy.
76840	77840	Sandmen.
78840	80840	Alright, thank you.
80840	83840	I don't know why.
83840	85840	I'll make you this deal.
85840	88840	Every night I come out, I'll see if I start rapping good.
88840	93840	And if I don't, like just the other side of the deal is, just let me stop.
93840	95840	I like that.
95840	99840	That sounds like it solves a lot of the problems with the rapping.
99840	103840	I don't hear anybody protesting, no, keep rapping after it turns out you're going to
103840	105840	rap badly.
105840	106840	Keep going.
106840	107840	Push through it.
107840	108840	Fake it till you make it.
108840	110840	I think this is the easiest deal we've ever made.
110840	116840	Isn't it true, though, that I think it's axiomatic that when you win an Emmy, your rapping skills
116840	122840	like dip for a while?
122840	127840	Did I win another Emmy?
127840	132840	Do I have twice as many Emmys as I had before the Emmys?
133840	135840	How many people got to keep the statue?
135840	137840	Did you get one?
137840	140840	Jesus Christ, yes.
140840	142840	It is fascinating, though.
142840	155840	When you win one, your fantasy of what it would be like is sort of simultaneously,
155840	161840	everything about it is true and simultaneously sort of like it's so demystifying.
161840	168840	I'm not sure what I mean by that, but it's like you picture yourself going up and you
168840	175840	hold this thing and you're like, holy shit, this happened, and it feels like a scratch-off
175840	176840	ticket.
176840	178840	It just sort of just is random.
178840	181840	You just have this weird relationship with is this going to happen or not?
181840	184840	And then you're walking into a fantasy.
184840	190840	And then the really weird thing is that you're just sort of like directed off stage.
190840	193840	And then there's just all this shit that happens.
193840	199840	And none of it, it's like when you're on ecstasy or mushrooms or something where life is a joke.
199840	204840	And the whole system is geared around people that are going to feel that way.
204840	207840	So it's very much like a slaughterhouse.
207840	209840	It's like the opposite of a slaughterhouse.
209840	220840	It's an immortality house because they know that they're working with dazed narcissists
220840	224840	who are like, moo, I want an Emmy.
224840	229840	And you just follow robot chicken and you just go down.
229840	232840	And they'll corral you in certain areas.
232840	234840	And now you can eat a sandwich.
234840	238840	You haven't had one in four hours and you're just sort of like, yeah, I'm so hungry.
238840	240840	And then someone's like, that's for press.
240840	243840	And you're like, I don't care. I have an Emmy.
243840	249840	But you just sort of become this baby because I think that is all of our fantasies, right?
249840	257840	Like about that idea of getting an award, it really, I think what we all think.
257840	263840	I mean, I'll use my I statements any time you want, but I want to connect with you guys.
263840	268840	But I just feel like that's the thing that you want to achieve,
268840	273840	is that one brief weightless moment of like, so I'm okay no matter what I do,
273840	279840	which is such an ironic feeling to have to win an award to feel.
279840	281840	It makes no sense.
281840	286840	It doesn't because you're supposed to feel that when you wake up and then you're absolutely...
286840	290840	Which of the two Emmys that you have on your mantle now weighs the most?
290840	293840	They're both six pounds, Jeff, and I didn't look it up and I don't care.
293840	294840	No.
294840	302840	I did not look into whether or not the shelf would be able to hold another one.
302840	307840	I don't plan for this shit. I have no ambitions.
307840	309840	Do you feel like you might have to get a new mantle?
309840	314840	Because if you keep winning all these Emmys, you have to up your mantle game.
314840	315840	I'm all done, buddy.
315840	321840	This one was a huge... I absolutely did not expect...
321840	328840	I fully... I was like, deserve? Sure.
328840	332840	Expect? No.
332840	336840	That's a very relatable stance.
336840	340840	Did I deserve it? You better fucking believe I deserve it.
340840	345840	And everybody always... Everybody nominated deserves it because that all represents all of this work.
345840	347840	I was like, that's what I'm saying.
347840	349840	Who did you be? Who are you up against on this one?
349840	352840	Family Guy and shit?
352840	360840	South Park and The Simpsons and The Muppets. I don't know.
360840	367840	Look, I can't believe you gotch at me. I don't know who else was nominated. I didn't care.
367840	371840	Can we? Can we?
371840	375840	I didn't fucking care. Because I knew I wasn't... Because you deserved it.
375840	380840	Because I knew I wasn't gonna talk if I won, so I don't need to know...
380840	383840	Wait, so did Rylone get up and talk?
383840	385840	Yeah, we made a... Like, who's gonna talk?
385840	388840	They tell you, you gotta pick a person to talk. Right.
388840	394840	Justin and I are like the whole time, we're like, who's gonna talk? You should talk. No, you should talk.
395840	399840	Let Jessica talk. That would be badass.
399840	405840	But it's like, who's going up? That was the more important thing. Who's going up?
405840	412840	Because they put this fear of God in you. You gotta get up here 30 seconds for your speech and stuff.
412840	418840	And then you're sitting there through the show and you're like, there's like 20 people out here.
418840	423840	If they all get up and go up there... It turns out the answer is yes, it's all fine.
423840	427840	It's just a path of least resistance. For a production thing, it's like, yeah, everybody get up there.
427840	429840	It's an award for everybody.
429840	434840	But we were just like... I was just like sweating and going like, what do you do?
434840	441840	Who's... Justin said, I think it should just be me and you, and then so and so and so and so.
441840	446840	And I was like, okay, Justin, but... And the whole show's going, I just wanna clarify.
446840	452840	Are you saying that if... And there's like Cody between us.
452840	456840	Like it's not just me and his ear. Are you saying...
456840	462840	And the winner for best some other human being that you're doing this during is...
462840	470840	Are you saying if they call our name and obviously the big asterisk here is we're not expecting to win,
470840	476840	so we shouldn't be having this conversation, let alone behind probably the other nominees.
476840	481840	I'm pretty sure Trey and Matt are sitting in front of us. I don't know.
481840	492840	But if we do win, air quotes, are you saying that when we stand up, if anyone else stands up,
492840	496840	should we look at them and go, eh, eh, eh?
496840	498840	And John goes, no, no, I'm not saying...
498840	502840	And the winner for the second award that's human beings that you'll never know...
502840	505840	Okay, well, I don't wanna... I just... I don't wanna talk another...
505840	508840	Yes, we don't know. No one knows. There's no leadership.
508840	512840	We don't know. We don't know who goes up.
512840	521840	And then I think Mike McMahan, who had the right answer, he's like, it's everyone in the catalog.
521840	527840	It's everyone that's listed. So in the program, it'll say. So those are the people that go up.
527840	530840	It's like 11 people for Rick and Morty.
530840	532840	And they all get their own individual...
532840	534840	Those are the people that get statues. They go up.
534840	538840	Because they have like credit of some whatever kind on the episode.
538840	542840	So all those people, we get herded like cattle into this back room and stuff.
542840	546840	And then you fill out the thing. I talked about this, right?
546840	552840	The weird thing is that you go into this back room and everyone is just like, it's so...
552840	556840	You're looking at people who are...
556840	564840	These are the only people for whom it's not an honor to be nominated have to be the people that just sit there.
564840	569840	And they're like, they just continually all day for two days for the creative arts.
569840	572840	I mean, they're like just nonstop chain of people.
572840	574840	For them, it is like a slaughterhouse.
574840	580840	But they're like, congratulations. They have this look on their face.
580840	585840	Like a Disneyland employee. You told me you get fired if someone says you didn't smile.
585840	592840	I imagine that the pressure is on them or that they come to the table with they actually wanted to be near that.
592840	596840	Because they're just like, oh my god, congratulations.
596840	602840	And you're like, yeah, but this is like chain of people. This is assembly line.
602840	607840	And you get handed a statue from a box and it has nothing on it.
607840	614840	My statue still has nothing on it because you fill out a form that goes to a place that makes the plates.
614840	617840	And then the plate gets mailed to you.
617840	618840	And the form...
618840	620840	And you got it like super good back on?
620840	623840	It has little screws on the back. I'm so glad we're getting...
624840	629840	I feel like if there's one thing my podcast can do for people is prepare you for your Emmy.
629840	632840	Yeah. We're here to make you...
632840	634840	It has like a little band on it.
634840	639840	But the curious thing about it is that the form says, what's your name? What's your address?
639840	642840	What's the name of your show? What category did you win?
642840	649840	It's not like multiple choice. So I just keep thinking like, so if I just write like, oh, yeah.
650840	655840	Can you just write Rick and Morty parentheses biggest dick?
656840	657840	Yeah.
657840	661840	Hitler did nothing wrong. That's what 4chan would do.
661840	665840	I just feel like you look and you go like, this is hackable.
665840	668840	Because I'm standing next to Justin and Justin's right.
668840	672840	I'm like, what's the name? Because the categories aren't easy to remember.
672840	682840	I was like, outstanding evidence of goodness by a thing on TV that was a cartoon.
682840	686840	What did you put? It's like, best TV show that's a cartoon?
686840	690840	And I'm like, well, that's not the same. I don't think either of them are right.
691840	697840	Is the idea that they just put these things in a wood chipper and then some like gnome like goes, I know what these guys mean.
698840	703840	If you wrote best TV show, that would pass muster.
703840	711840	No, they don't make it. It's like the final chamber of like the Holy Grail where you have to actually like pick it out and you don't get one.
712840	715840	Can we talk about the sandwiches?
716840	723840	This is just OK, so I'm an outsider. Come, come, insider in this whole Hollywood thing.
723840	732840	But there's this thing you encounter as a as a person in Hollywood, which is all these sandwiches that you can't eat.
732840	735840	What can what's the world? It's crazy.
735840	740840	We went to Comic Con and they're like, hey, you're going to be in this room doing all these interviews.
740840	742840	It's going to be great. It's like a big party.
742840	748840	Mike Tyson's there. You got all these sandwiches. You can't eat any of these sandwiches.
748840	753840	The sandwiches will just have this like and it won't be like a big blinking sign.
753840	757840	No, it's embarrassing. It's a sign just big enough for you to be halfway in your mouth.
757840	765840	And then it says X files. It says ham and cheese. It says like tomato and chicken and not for you.
765840	770840	Yeah. These are Jillian Anderson sandwiches like.
770840	775840	It's so great because there's you can sit down and you can take sandwiches.
775840	778840	And those are the two activities to do in those rooms.
778840	785840	It's surprising that even in the Emmy back dungeons and stuff, it's still like you want a sandwich or you want an Emmy.
785840	793840	But don't get cocky, buddy. These are fucking I did say I was drunk and on vodka and victory.
793840	798840	And I did say to my publicist who was politely saying those are for press.
798840	803840	And I said, here's a headline for you. Dan Harmon eats your fucking sandwich.
803840	809840	They love that stuff. I run with it. You run with everything else.
809840	815840	Yeah. That's a story I approve of. I was hungry. I'll tell you all the side.
815840	819840	I'm put up to make it a feature. Make it a puff piece or a fucking like, oh, come at me.
819840	824840	I drink the sandwich eater. I drink your milkshake.
824840	829840	Sorry. You come over there and drink the present milkshake. Yeah. Yeah.
829840	833840	Yeah. I drink. Yeah. I eat your sea in which I'm sure they would have been fine with it.
833840	837840	Wait. So why were there segregated sandwiches?
837840	843840	That's the thing is why do it in the first place other than to humiliate people?
843840	848840	That's not how food is served. That's how food is served.
848840	852840	I think when it gets to the point where food is on a tray.
852840	860840	I think that that is an important rule. I think that we're getting to a Christ like thing here where it's like maybe ownership.
860840	864840	We don't have to take aim at the concept of ownership in general.
864840	868840	Like you're not allowed to. You should make a sandwich and then not care who eats it.
868840	872840	I think that person is like, I just made this three in the morning. I'm so hungry.
872840	879840	It's halfway to my mouth. Like, OK, don't test me. But if you want some sandwiches or mass produced, like, yeah.
879840	883840	Going like, you know what? You can't you can't say that there's someone's.
883840	887840	Well, if you care that much, you don't you don't protect it through norms.
887840	891840	I'll tell you that you got to put it behind Plexiglas. Yeah. You need design work.
891840	896840	Yeah. You got to put enough effort. Your sandwiches are important.
896840	900840	Pay a security guard to shoot people that eat your sandwich.
900840	904840	Or just increase the size of the sign. Yeah.
905840	910840	What was the thing that I was like, I was there was such a I was like, I was like, yeah, put money in.
910840	914840	Oh, I don't know. No, I can't get into that. That's too. I'm sorry. I got personal. OK.
914840	921840	But but I'm like, oh, yeah, if you don't care, if you really care about this shit, then you would you would you would
921840	924840	you would express it through risking things.
924840	927840	And so I'll let that person have it. I'll tell you that.
927840	931840	Speaking of risking things, let's bring out Rob Schrod. Oh, shit.
934840	957840	I hope we talk about you winning an Emmy every week.
957840	964840	I can't wait till next week when we hear. Come on. This is another story about you winning an Emmy.
964840	972840	Like that would be. Oh, man. People want to know about the statue. People want to know.
972840	976840	No, they do. This is like insider stuff. No, they do. Spencer.
976840	982840	People want to know. People want to know. People want to know, Spencer. They want to know on a weekly basis.
982840	988840	I'm glad we could come on the show and agree. It's a goddamn Emmy night. It's a goddamn Emmy night.
988840	994840	It's every night, every night here, apparently. What was last week?
994840	998840	It was every night, too. Two weeks in a row. It's not my fault.
998840	1005840	It was every night, too. Oh, you can't fault me because the last episode was every night, too.
1005840	1010840	And now it's every night. Why are you talking about Bill Hader?
1010840	1016840	I'm going to get around to that. I'm not cool. I'm going to get around to my fellow Emmy winners.
1016840	1022840	What about Dinklage? Let's hear it for the Dink. He won tonight. Yeah, he did.
1022840	1028840	All right. A lot of Dinklage haters in the crowd. A lot of silent, silent Dinklage impression.
1028840	1032840	People not ready to give it up for Dinklage, just out of hand.
1032840	1037840	I was like, look, he can earn it. I haven't watched the show. I don't know.
1037840	1040840	I'm certainly not going to fall into that bullshit.
1040840	1045840	I haven't seen it. I'll take a look. Now that it won an Emmy, that's what I do.
1045840	1049840	I did it with Nurse Jackie. I'm doing the Game of Thrones.
1049840	1055840	Well, let me know how you think he did. He's fucking Peter Dinklage, you horrible Grinches.
1055840	1061840	I thought that was the one guy I could say that would get you people, my fans.
1061840	1065840	Aren't you basically emotional Dinklages?
1065840	1068840	Isn't that a description of my audience?
1068840	1072840	Episode title? Emotional Dinklages.
1072840	1078840	I am excited for him. I don't know. Did he win one? I don't know.
1078840	1081840	He won Best TV.
1081840	1086840	Whoa. He's got a great one. Did you ever see it?
1086840	1092840	Oh, my God. It's like 80 inches. 80 inches.
1093840	1096840	Did I say that I wanted to thank you guys for showing up on...
1096840	1097840	Oh, you spelled Dinklage.
1097840	1099840	Emmy Night? Yeah, on Emmy Night.
1099840	1100840	D-I-N.
1100840	1101840	This is bad.
1101840	1105840	Hey, Schwab, what's up with you?
1105840	1109840	I was looking up... Okay, stuff.
1109840	1112840	What's up? Might as well fill this dead air.
1112840	1115840	That's what I was trying to do. I was trying to provide cover.
1115840	1121840	Schwab, while I was away, Schwab, while I was away, did your chair get groovier?
1121840	1122840	You got a better chair.
1122840	1124840	I'm working on a good career.
1124840	1127840	Are you happy? When are we going to know that you're settled into your...
1127840	1129840	I love it here.
1129840	1131840	I've been coming every week.
1131840	1135840	But would you trade this chair in for one of those shitty stools?
1135840	1137840	No.
1137840	1138840	You're happy with this.
1138840	1141840	I'm happy. I could use an ottoman.
1144840	1149840	And a nice quilt to keep my knees warm.
1149840	1151840	Oh, we could get you a quilt.
1151840	1154840	Jeff is putting the piano thing...
1154840	1155840	You do it like this.
1155840	1157840	Like an ottoman.
1157840	1158840	Yeah, I support it.
1158840	1162840	You know what? I think you should have a fucking morphine IV.
1162840	1166840	I think you should have an electronic bed.
1166840	1169840	I think you should have like a...
1169840	1172840	I have a few notes.
1172840	1176840	He's holding sheet music.
1176840	1178840	I have a couple of notes.
1178840	1182840	That I'm going to bring to the next meeting that I have.
1182840	1187840	Oh, yeah. Well, I have a few notes, too.
1187840	1190840	Read them at your leisure.
1190840	1193840	Jack, Rap-key.
1193840	1195840	Yeah.
1195840	1198840	He just named a real guy.
1198840	1202840	It was a guy we worked for 20 years ago on Monster House.
1202840	1204840	His name just came out of your brain.
1204840	1206840	Because we're dying.
1206840	1211840	You're just like, Ferris wheel, depression, Hitler.
1211840	1218840	I want to wish a very happy birthday to Caleb.
1218840	1219840	He's turning 21.
1219840	1222840	He took a little solo pilgrimage from Portland.
1222840	1226840	Ran into him at the drawing room before I came here.
1226840	1227840	Is he here tonight?
1227840	1231840	If he's not, then he's a con artist.
1231840	1232840	I heard him.
1232840	1234840	It sounded like he was over there.
1234840	1235840	He bought me a drink.
1235840	1236840	Caitlin.
1236840	1237840	Yes, sir.
1237840	1239840	How's it going, man?
1239840	1242840	You got good seats.
1242840	1246840	Whoa!
1246840	1248840	Damn.
1248840	1250840	Oh, it's on.
1250840	1251840	It's on.
1251840	1252840	What happened?
1252840	1253840	I missed it.
1253840	1254840	There's a fight.
1254840	1257840	Jeff and Dan are fighting.
1258840	1261840	Absolutely nothing happened.
1261840	1269840	A fine young man expressed a sincere embrace of his favorite show.
1269840	1272840	What is it?
1272840	1274840	And everyone turned it into a thing.
1274840	1276840	Because people are animals.
1276840	1280840	And I have no loyalty to them.
1280840	1283840	The show has become watching me.
1283840	1285840	Where's these fucking Emmy sandwiches, man?
1286840	1288840	You should have brought some Emmy sandwiches.
1288840	1294840	Talk about something else other than the fucking Emmys.
1294840	1302840	I don't think enough hullabaloo has been made about the fact that I fucking met and hung out with Ron Perlman on a fucking plane today.
1302840	1306840	That guy has the softest hands.
1306840	1308840	Oh, no.
1308840	1310840	Do you want that getting out?
1310840	1312840	Shake Ron Perlman's hand.
1312840	1314840	He's never worked a day in his life.
1314840	1317840	How do you be a hellboy and have just fucking...
1317840	1319840	His hands are made of just like...
1319840	1321840	He's supposed to be famous for having hell hands, right?
1321840	1323840	Does he have a hell glove or a soft...
1323840	1325840	Well, he's got that one giant hand.
1325840	1327840	I don't know, man.
1327840	1328840	Ron!
1328840	1330840	We talked about French film.
1330840	1332840	He has soft hands.
1332840	1334840	We're going to have dinner together.
1334840	1336840	He's my new best friend, so go...
1336840	1338840	You can fuck your Emmy.
1338840	1343840	I'll take Ron Perlman's delicious soft hands.
1343840	1348840	Look, my winning of an Emmy was not a challenge to anybody here.
1348840	1353840	I never thought for a second while I was winning it, oh, this proves that other people are pieces of shit.
1353840	1360840	I'm too busy trying to rise above the fucking muck and mire, and I'm like, well, this means I can breathe for six weeks.
1360840	1363840	So don't fucking get mad at me.
1363840	1366840	Go ahead, get mad at me, you little pieces of shit.
1366840	1367840	Sorry.
1367840	1369840	Okay, true colors.
1369840	1372840	I did think for a second you guys were pieces of shit.
1372840	1374840	I was like, well, this proves a piece of shit.
1374840	1376840	Do you think that's your last Emmy?
1376840	1377840	Do you think that's the last one?
1377840	1379840	I hope it is, because I want to...
1379840	1386840	The way I want to go out is like both of those pointed wings, like fucking carotid and jugular.
1386840	1388840	That's a safe statement.
1388840	1390840	What? Oh, Jesus.
1390840	1391840	Wait, what is?
1391840	1398840	Dean Harmon controversially proposes suicide by Emmy.
1398840	1399840	No, that's not what I was...
1399840	1404840	That's so irresponsible, because there's so many kids out there that are going to win an Emmy so they can kill themselves.
1404840	1405840	I would...
1405840	1406840	I almost like...
1406840	1407840	This is where I won't go.
1407840	1410840	I almost want to say, yeah, America, I hate kids.
1410840	1414840	If you're thinking of ending your life, do it with an Emmy.
1414840	1417840	Just because it would trick them into a rock soup thing where they're like...
1417840	1423840	They would get to a point where they're like 45 and they're like, I don't need to do this.
1423840	1426840	The shrub's doing something.
1426840	1429840	The show has just become me.
1429840	1432840	He's showing up and...
1436840	1439840	I'm not building anything.
1441840	1443840	I'm trying so hard.
1443840	1446840	I have a list of things to talk about.
1446840	1449840	Start from the bottom.
1449840	1450840	I can't...
1450840	1452840	That's a thing I got crossed off.
1452840	1453840	Mandy.
1453840	1455840	Everybody go see Mandy if you haven't...
1456840	1459840	That's a movie, the Nick Cage movie?
1459840	1460840	Yeah, it's great.
1460840	1461840	I think it's just on Netflix.
1461840	1463840	Or not Netflix, iTunes.
1463840	1464840	It's out, right?
1464840	1466840	Yeah, the soundtrack's great too.
1466840	1468840	I just bought the soundtrack as well.
1468840	1471840	A real tour de force.
1471840	1473840	A real burner.
1473840	1474840	A real burning...
1474840	1476840	Hopefully the others start burning up the charts.
1476840	1477840	I fucked up.
1477840	1478840	Yeah, shake it.
1478840	1479840	I fucked up.
1479840	1480840	Undo typing, undo...
1480840	1481840	Shaking his phone.
1481840	1482840	Well, as I said, undo.
1482840	1484840	I accidentally pasted...
1484840	1487840	Spencer, does shaking your phone help?
1487840	1489840	Yeah, they need to make it...
1489840	1490840	Undo it so you undo.
1490840	1491840	What do you want from me?
1491840	1493840	They should have a better gesture.
1493840	1495840	All right, I'm moving up from the bottom of the list.
1495840	1499840	Uber, I learned how to do multiple locations.
1500840	1502840	So I will actually provide more Uber rides now
1502840	1505840	because the truth is, if I've ever been with you
1505840	1508840	and it's time to get an Uber,
1508840	1510840	if I think that there's going to be some chicanery
1510840	1512840	with like, oh, we've got to go here
1512840	1513840	and then we've got to drop off someone's...
1513840	1516840	I'll kind of fade into the background.
1516840	1518840	But I'll throw my money at anything.
1518840	1520840	I just don't want to have to talk to people
1520840	1522840	because it seemed to me that you have to get in the car
1522840	1523840	and then you have to go,
1523840	1526840	um, thank you for showing up under the auspices
1526840	1528840	of our original destination.
1528840	1530840	However, a few things to throw at you.
1530840	1532840	Would you mind making a brief stop?
1532840	1535840	I don't want to have those conversations,
1535840	1537840	but I found a...
1537840	1538840	I didn't find it.
1538840	1540840	It was shown to me by a friend.
1540840	1542840	I can't believe this guy went on Emmy.
1543840	1544840	There's an...
1544840	1546840	It is an easy interview.
1546840	1548840	There's a plus button when you think of it.
1548840	1549840	You can just add locations.
1549840	1551840	I picked up this fucking asshole.
1551840	1554840	What did you think the plus button meant?
1556840	1559840	Like, make the destination louder?
1563840	1565840	Ah, 32.
1565840	1568840	I don't know.
1568840	1570840	I mean, whatever.
1571840	1573840	I'm going to play musical stings
1573840	1575840	every time a shrub scores on you.
1575840	1577840	Yeah. Fine.
1577840	1579840	You just got dunked on, man.
1579840	1580840	I don't care.
1580840	1581840	I'm not going to...
1581840	1583840	Here's something that won't get a musical score.
1583840	1585840	Me not letting it affect me,
1585840	1587840	which is actually a huger fucking...
1587840	1589840	Like, that's me winning.
1589840	1590840	Like, I don't care.
1590840	1591840	It's me, therapy's working.
1591840	1592840	I don't care.
1592840	1594840	I don't fucking care.
1594840	1596840	Like, fucking hate me, dude.
1596840	1598840	Like, you can't control my feelings.
1598840	1600840	You don't...
1600840	1602840	Like, I can fucking put you in an airlock
1602840	1606840	and flush you into space, like a fucking predator.
1606840	1609840	That was my favorite ending of The Predator.
1614840	1615840	When Danny Glover...
1615840	1616840	That one I deserved.
1616840	1619840	Danny Glover put The Predator...
1619840	1620840	I will acknowledge that burn.
1620840	1624840	In the airlock and sent the Predator out into space.
1624840	1626840	That's how you can always trust me, you know?
1626840	1628840	Like, I'm like, oh, yeah, I fucked up.
1628840	1629840	And then you're like, I like Dan.
1629840	1630840	He knows when he fucks up.
1630840	1633840	So that means when I say he's not hurting me,
1633840	1634840	he's not hurting me.
1634840	1639840	I hear the new The Predator movie is getting mixed reviews.
1639840	1642840	It did not do well this weekend.
1642840	1646840	Gosh, I wish they would give that and Jay Moore one more shot.
1646840	1648840	Yeah.
1648840	1649840	I just...
1649840	1651840	I don't think we've gotten The Predator.
1651840	1652840	Make Jay Moore The Predator.
1652840	1653840	Make him The Predator.
1653840	1654840	Fucking...
1654840	1655840	Let's just double down on that.
1655840	1656840	What about...
1656840	1657840	Maybe Predator Purge.
1657840	1660840	Like, obviously, these are two things that society's just like...
1660840	1662840	Run, run, run, run, run, run.
1662840	1663840	You're flooding it.
1663840	1664840	You're flooding the engine.
1664840	1666840	This is the ninth Purge movie.
1666840	1668840	Like, what do people like about it?
1668840	1670840	I can't figure it out.
1670840	1674840	It's the title and the promise that you made in the poster,
1674840	1678840	which you obviously can't deliver on within the budget you're willing to spend.
1678840	1683840	A proper Purge movie would, for instance, be a television show, which it is.
1683840	1686840	I think I re-ended my old friend Anthony Hemingway.
1686840	1689840	I think he's working on that Purge show on Netflix.
1689840	1692840	I make it an anthological TV show.
1692840	1696840	People's interest in the Purge concept is anthological.
1696840	1700840	The movies try to be anthological, and then they ruin themselves with this thing.
1700840	1704840	It's like, oh, I'm supposed to care about the ending of the Purge franchise?
1704840	1705840	No, you're supposed to...
1705840	1709840	And the Predator thing is just like, oh, what if there was a thing hunting us?
1709840	1711840	Because we hunt things so much.
1711840	1713840	It's not working.
1713840	1716840	We're getting under our own feet here.
1716840	1718840	I see a Predator poster.
1718840	1719840	I'm 45 years old.
1719840	1720840	I'm like, what?
1720840	1722840	Is this a reboot or a sequel?
1722840	1725840	There was Predators, and then there was a guy from that 70s show.
1725840	1727840	It was a serial killer in it.
1727840	1730840	Now the movie's just the Predator?
1730840	1731840	And it's just...
1731840	1733840	This is year 18.
1733840	1735840	Like, don't Google it.
1735840	1738840	That's what the slogan for the Predator is.
1738840	1741840	Predator, don't Google it.
1741840	1747840	It's from the creators of nothing before.
1747840	1748840	Trust us.
1748840	1750840	So we came up with this new idea.
1750840	1752840	What if you were getting hunted?
1752840	1754840	You're like, hey, you like eating a hot dog?
1754840	1756840	What if you were the hot dog?
1756840	1757840	Don't look it up.
1757840	1759840	We've never done it before.
1759840	1760840	Like, no one knows.
1760840	1763840	Like, if you're eight years old, you still know.
1763840	1766840	Just from that handshake between Carl Weathers and fucking Schwarzenegger,
1766840	1770840	everyone knows the fucking bicep handshake.
1770840	1771840	Even if you haven't seen the movie.
1771840	1774840	That's like, are you ready for your close-up, Mr. DeMille?
1774840	1778840	Remember when that lady said that?
1778840	1779840	In Sunset Boulevard?
1779840	1780840	Yeah.
1780840	1782840	Are you ready for your close-up, Mr. DeMille?
1782840	1783840	Here's my pitch.
1783840	1785840	You fucking put a Predator in Sunset Boulevard.
1785840	1787840	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
1787840	1792840	The movie starts with a Predator in the pool and goes like, that's me.
1792840	1794840	I tried to hunt an old starlet.
1794840	1795840	But it's all...
1795840	1796840	I'm dead.
1796840	1798840	It's all in Predator language.
1798840	1800840	Hollywood is so doggy doggy.
1802840	1804840	I just wanted some candy.
1804840	1807840	Hollywood is so doggy doggy that it killed the Predator.
1807840	1808840	Yeah.
1808840	1809840	He couldn't fucking eat Predator.
1809840	1815840	Hey, I like it that the last three Predator movies are expecting us to still be impressed
1815840	1817840	with thermal dynamic.
1817840	1820840	Like, oh, wow, I can see the heat.
1820840	1822840	Get the fuck out of here.
1825840	1835840	They cut you off, man.
1835840	1837840	I don't blame them.
1837840	1838840	Hello?
1838840	1845840	We got night vision on our telephones and we're supposed to go, oh, wow, look at this
1845840	1850840	orange and yellow and blue splotchy vision.
1850840	1853840	He could see anything.
1853840	1854840	Oh, my God.
1854840	1855840	Wow.
1855840	1857840	That's really impressive.
1857840	1864840	But let me get in my drone and fly to the fucking froyo.
1864840	1867840	What the fuck are you talking about?
1867840	1868840	Wow.
1868840	1869840	Oh, my God.
1869840	1871840	He could see if I'm hot or cold.
1871840	1873840	He could do that.
1873840	1875840	Amazing.
1875840	1877840	Oh, my God.
1877840	1879840	Wow, the Predator.
1879840	1881840	Get out of here, man.
1881840	1888840	I hope I don't run into a cumbersome nine-foot dreadlocked space man with a harpoon arm
1888840	1894840	in this world where people can Craigslist rape people by the dozens over email.
1894840	1897840	Yeah, the Predator is a real word.
1897840	1901840	It happens like 90 times a day.
1901840	1902840	Hashtag Predator.
1902840	1904840	Oh, yeah, man.
1904840	1907840	It's a horrible, awful world.
1908840	1913840	How many people that you could interview from last week if you could round up souls that
1913840	1918840	went out in a certain way, like, hey, would you trade the way you went out for just a
1918840	1920840	run with the Predator hunting you?
1920840	1921840	Fuck, yeah.
1921840	1922840	What the fuck happened to me?
1922840	1927840	I was walking out of a 7-Eleven and I got shot because my hat's wrong.
1927840	1928840	Here's the thing.
1928840	1932840	It's like they go, okay, so the Predator.
1932840	1933840	No, no.
1933840	1934840	Get ready, though.
1934840	1935840	Get ready.
1936840	1941840	So the Predator is like, oh, well, you know, he's invisible.
1941840	1942840	Stop there.
1942840	1943840	He's invisible.
1943840	1944840	That's all he could do.
1944840	1950840	But he could see you in spotty orange and yellow splotches and he's got a knife that
1950840	1951840	goes really fast.
1951840	1952840	What does he do?
1952840	1953840	What does he do on the shoulder?
1953840	1958840	When he's not invisible, when Predator is just being Predator up in a tree, does he
1958840	1961840	still see you as splotchy orange and yellow on blues or does he see you regular?
1961840	1962840	He can switch.
1962840	1963840	He switches.
1964840	1965840	He can switch between things.
1965840	1968840	They celebrate that in the movie, end of the video games, and it's like, oh, he can
1968840	1969840	switch.
1969840	1970840	He could choose to see heat.
1970840	1974840	He could choose to see, like, fear, I don't know.
1974840	1975840	But the important thing is...
1975840	1980840	But that fear would be another layer or something like that.
1980840	1981840	He just, like, thermodynamics.
1981840	1982840	No shit.
1982840	1985840	My kid's got a toy that can do that.
1985840	1986840	But give me something.
1986840	1988840	Give me ideas, man.
1988840	1990840	But here's the craziest thing to me.
1990840	1992840	Here's the thing that bumps me the most.
1992840	1994840	I believe you and I saw Predator 2 in the theater.
1994840	1995840	Yes, we did.
1995840	1999840	That's how old we are and how long this friendship has been failing.
1999840	2001840	Like, I don't know.
2001840	2003840	Let's give it one more decade.
2003840	2004840	Yeah.
2004840	2010840	Well, we saw Predator 2, and I was like, so we were there when Danny Glover looked at
2010840	2013840	him and said, fuck you, pussy face.
2013840	2016840	And the crowd went, wow, I never thought about that.
2016840	2020840	It looks like a pussy.
2021840	2022840	And then...
2022840	2025840	Danny Glover's at number two?
2025840	2026840	Yeah.
2026840	2027840	And he calls him pussy face?
2027840	2028840	Yes.
2028840	2032840	And the first Predator, of course we know that in the first Predator...
2032840	2035840	What did you think the movie was about?
2035840	2038840	I never saw the second one.
2038840	2044840	I thought it ended when Arnold Schwarzenegger would go, you are one ugly son of a bitch.
2044840	2045840	Yeah.
2045840	2046840	That's what happened to the first movie.
2046840	2048840	So then they made a second one, and then they doubled down on it.
2048840	2049840	He called him pussy face.
2050840	2052840	So that's the thing is they keep...
2052840	2053840	Number...
2053840	2056840	Predator 2 is the reason why we have aliens versus Predator, because they go...
2056840	2059840	Danny Glover goes on the spaceship, and we see...
2059840	2062840	He goes on the spaceship, and there's more Predators.
2062840	2067840	And they combine this moment of like, Danny Glover goes like, I fucking...
2067840	2068840	I got you.
2068840	2069840	I beat you.
2069840	2073840	And then multiple Predators come out of the fog.
2073840	2074840	He's on the mothership.
2074840	2078840	You think it's just like, oh, I tracked this rich douchebag back to his Lexus, right?
2079840	2085840	But then, no, you tracked this rich douchebag back to his...
2086840	2087840	Dealership.
2088840	2089840	No.
2089840	2091840	No, you're just connecting dots.
2091840	2092840	You're just trying to be...
2092840	2094840	It doesn't make any sense.
2094840	2100840	If you were immersed in what I'm saying, you wouldn't be trying to take shots at me by changing Lexus to Tesla.
2100840	2101840	That's lateral.
2101840	2102840	It would be...
2102840	2104840	Winnebago would be the answer.
2104840	2105840	You reactive fuck.
2105840	2107840	You're just trying to affect me.
2108840	2109840	Oh, there's the moon.
2109840	2110840	Can I hit it with a slingshot?
2110840	2111840	Yes, you can.
2111840	2113840	You can hit anything.
2113840	2114840	You're a human being.
2114840	2116840	Now what are you going to do with that power?
2117840	2118840	How does it...
2118840	2119840	What?
2119840	2120840	I can't hear you.
2120840	2121840	It's not about you.
2121840	2122840	The show's not about you.
2122840	2125840	That's why there's no microphone in front of you.
2125840	2126840	There's nothing.
2126840	2127840	It's not about...
2127840	2130840	The show can't be about you.
2130840	2132840	It's barely about me, and it's my name.
2132840	2135840	I can't even control it, and I'm up here.
2136840	2138840	These are my friends.
2139840	2142840	Look what's happening to me up here.
2142840	2146840	Did you perceive me as not challenged enough?
2147840	2151840	Did you want to throw me out of my comfort zone?
2152840	2155840	Oh, he's not having a hard enough time.
2155840	2158840	He doesn't know what to do up there.
2158840	2160840	Or he's too on rails.
2160840	2162840	This is too scripted.
2166840	2168840	I want to see what happens.
2173840	2175840	The lights are changing.
2176840	2178840	The colors are changing.
2182840	2185840	Danny Glover tracks a guy...
2186840	2189840	He thought he tracked the rich juice bag back to his Lexus.
2189840	2190840	He impales him.
2190840	2191840	I got him.
2191840	2193840	Turns out it's a Winnebago.
2195840	2203840	Because the dot you should have fucking connected is that there's more predators.
2203840	2207840	But you didn't see Predator 2, because you're 18.
2209840	2212840	And that's not a strength.
2213840	2216840	CNN makes you feel like that makes you powerful.
2216840	2219840	All it means is that you're going to die later than me.
2220840	2222840	Big deal.
2223840	2226840	You see what happens when the Emmys don't give you a sandwich?
2226840	2228840	This is how it all...
2229840	2231840	I'm glad I'm going to die before you.
2231840	2234840	Good luck with your molten planet.
2234840	2238840	Good luck trying to figure out how to eat rotten corn.
2239840	2241840	I'm happy.
2241840	2243840	Because you were mean to me.
2244840	2246840	Enjoy your hydroponic rotten corn.
2246840	2248840	Are you ashamed of having a Tesla?
2248840	2250840	This is what it sounds like.
2250840	2252840	He said Tesla.
2252840	2255840	And fucking Elon Musk has turned out to be a fucking 24 carat.
2255840	2257840	Don't even finish that sentence. I love him.
2257840	2259840	He's my best friend.
2259840	2260840	He's a great guy.
2260840	2261840	Fuck you.
2263840	2265840	Can I finish the goddamn...
2265840	2267840	The podcast should be called
2267840	2270840	Can Dan Harmon Get Through A Fucking Thought?
2276840	2277840	Caleb.
2277840	2278840	21 years old.
2278840	2280840	This poor guy has officially...
2280840	2282840	Because he said, listen to all the episodes.
2282840	2283840	He's 21.
2283840	2286840	That means he spent 5% of his life listening to this shit.
2287840	2290840	He had to get through 300 plus episodes of this.
2290840	2294840	He's wasted an actual measurable percentage of his young life listening to us.
2294840	2296840	Caleb, you don't have to verify this.
2296840	2298840	I don't want you to get drawn into this.
2298840	2300840	But I think the irony is...
2300840	2302840	And I know you're thinking it too.
2302840	2304840	This show started as me going,
2304840	2306840	Hey, don't let me go off on a tangent.
2306840	2307840	Oh, it was so funny.
2307840	2309840	Because, oh, Dan Harmon's stream of consciousness.
2309840	2311840	It was for it to evolve to the point where I'm just like,
2311840	2315840	Can I fucking talk for a second without everyone attacking me?
2316840	2318840	It's ironic. I know you agree.
2318840	2322840	I think the show does suffer from you not getting a platform.
2325840	2327840	So anyways...
2329840	2331840	He thought he chased him back to the...
2331840	2332840	He fucking...
2332840	2333840	He thought he chased him back to the...
2333840	2335840	Call the pussy face.
2335840	2338840	He chases him back to the fucking predatorship.
2338840	2340840	He kills the predator.
2340840	2342840	And then he goes, I killed you, pussy face.
2342840	2344840	And then...
2344840	2346840	He looks around and threw the fog.
2346840	2348840	Seven predators.
2348840	2350840	Wow, wow, wow.
2350840	2353840	And you're like, Oh shit.
2353840	2355840	He's so fucked.
2355840	2356840	Yeah.
2356840	2360840	He just spent the whole movie dealing with one predator.
2360840	2363840	And the first movie was one predator.
2364840	2365840	The only thing we changed...
2365840	2369840	We didn't go straight multiple predators at the top of the second movie.
2369840	2371840	Like James Cameron style.
2371840	2375840	It was like predator changed the location to near future Los Angeles.
2375840	2378840	So then he's like, I got you. I killed you.
2378840	2380840	And then, wow, wow.
2380840	2381840	Multiple predators.
2381840	2382840	And you're like, fuck.
2382840	2384840	God damn it. We're really fucked.
2384840	2387840	And then like the lead predator walks up to him.
2387840	2390840	How do you tell which one's the lead predator?
2390840	2391840	He's in front.
2391840	2393840	Choreography is how you tell.
2393840	2394840	Blocking.
2394840	2397840	The director told him you should talk to interact with Mr. Glover.
2397840	2399840	Bob Fosse. He's a good guy.
2399840	2403840	And basically it goes like...
2406840	2408840	Jeff's dancing.
2408840	2411840	They like appraise him.
2411840	2414840	They go, huh.
2414840	2419840	Looks like this prey came on board our ship
2419840	2423840	that we use to be predators to predate.
2426840	2430840	And it looks like he's gotten the better of one of our predator colleagues.
2432840	2435840	And they react, of course.
2435840	2440840	Because this is what all of us would do if you were dolphin hunting.
2440840	2441840	That's what hunters do.
2441840	2444840	You really hunt because you have so much respect for a deer
2444840	2447840	that if a deer killed your best friend, you'd be like,
2447840	2450840	you're gonna come to my wedding.
2450840	2453840	That's what that means when you see antlers on a wall.
2453840	2457840	It means like, I got him, and if I hadn't gotten him,
2457840	2460840	I would have fucking honored him for the rest of his life.
2460840	2463840	No, I got him. He's weak. He's on my wall.
2463840	2467840	But the predators are like, oh, you killed a predator.
2467840	2470840	His fucking body's on the floor of our car.
2470840	2472840	You're a human. We come here to hunt.
2472840	2476840	By the way, what the fuck are those guys doing that whole weekend?
2477840	2480840	Is one of them in San Francisco?
2480840	2483840	Do they split up? I'm gonna be in Seattle.
2483840	2485840	See, these are all great questions
2485840	2488840	that would have been a really interesting third predator movie.
2488840	2492840	Yeah, but instead, in case I'm being obtuse about this,
2492840	2494840	but I think you could predict,
2494840	2496840	there's a mislead of, oh, I'm fucked.
2496840	2498840	And then they're like, what do they do?
2498840	2500840	They give them a predator weapon.
2500840	2505840	No, no, no. They give them an antique American weapon or whatever from the Civil War.
2505840	2508840	Oh, that's even worse. That's so much worse.
2508840	2510840	They've been doing this for a while.
2510840	2512840	You know, the last time we got our asses kicked
2512840	2516840	is when the fucking Confederates got the balls.
2516840	2519840	I didn't read it. That is what you're reading it when I preside.
2519840	2521840	Well, I didn't read it until you said that,
2521840	2523840	because I was like, holy shit.
2523840	2525840	No, no, no. I'm not reading him going,
2525840	2528840	hey, we fought a good fight. Here's something for your trouble.
2528840	2532840	I thought he was going, yeah, Eric was a dick.
2532840	2537840	Well, what's the difference between those two?
2537840	2539840	Isn't that the same thing?
2539840	2543840	You're like saying, oh, it's an honorable thing.
2543840	2547840	Even though we're enemies, I can respect you.
2547840	2550840	Here's something for your trouble. Thank you for your...
2550840	2552840	It's a sport.
2552840	2554840	You wouldn't extend to someone if Eric wasn't a dick.
2554840	2557840	I mean, they clearly hate the fucking Predator.
2557840	2559840	Then we're both right.
2559840	2562840	The bottom line is they don't fucking kill them.
2562840	2564840	They're just like, you know what?
2564840	2566840	We're fucking cool like that.
2566840	2568840	We come here, we hunt you.
2568840	2570840	We turn invisible.
2570840	2572840	We come here in a spaceship.
2572840	2574840	We hunt you invisibly.
2574840	2576840	We hang out in the spaceship invisible.
2576840	2579840	That's how much we like being invisible.
2579840	2584840	It's like, hey, it's your shit.
2584840	2586840	It's your shit.
2586840	2588840	It's your fucking shit.
2588840	2590840	They're like real.
2590840	2592840	What are they doing?
2592840	2594840	Making eggs and watching TV.
2594840	2598840	Danny Glover walks in and they're like...
2598840	2602840	Why are they invisible on their ship?
2602840	2604840	Why?
2604840	2607840	It's been 25 years.
2607840	2609840	Are you seeing this?
2609840	2612840	I'm not seeing you. Who's saying that?
2612840	2617840	The explanation of that might be that they're in the Predator man cave
2617840	2619840	and they're watching.
2619840	2621840	Also, I don't want to give it through a modern lens
2621840	2625840	because predators are anything if not androgynous.
2625840	2628840	We shouldn't keep calling them heave.
2628840	2632840	They're solely defined by their love of hunting.
2632840	2634840	We don't know if they're sexual or not.
2634840	2639840	But they're in a person cave and they're watching security cameras
2639840	2641840	and they say, is this fucking guy?
2641840	2645840	I told you to close the fucking Predator door
2645840	2648840	on the ship that we parked in this mining tunnel
2648840	2650840	outside of Los Angeles in 1997.
2650840	2652840	Well, you don't pick up your shoes.
2652840	2655840	You told me, Cliff's coming back.
2655840	2657840	He's going to hunt a cast of nine,
2657840	2661840	including Maria Conchito Alonza and Bill Paxton.
2661840	2663840	And then we're going to fucking take off.
2663840	2665840	And you said, because he's a douchebag,
2665840	2667840	I don't want to fucking wake up and get the door for him.
2667840	2669840	I'm like, yeah, but okay, now there's a fucking dude.
2669840	2671840	There's an L.A. cop in our ship.
2671840	2673840	He's looking at our trophy room.
2673840	2675840	All right, well, let's go fucking meh.
2675840	2676840	And then they turn invisible.
2676840	2678840	They're like, let's go check it out.
2678840	2679840	And they're like, meh, meh.
2679840	2680840	And they all go.
2680840	2681840	And then he's like finishing killing Eric.
2681840	2683840	And they're like, this dude's killing Eric.
2683840	2684840	Yeah.
2684840	2687840	I was like, all right, let's fucking meh.
2687840	2690840	And he's like, oh, shit, bring it on.
2690840	2692840	And they're like, look, don't speak English.
2692840	2695840	Certainly not going to self-destruct.
2695840	2697840	Basically, we're pussies.
2697840	2701840	Like, Predators are fucking like, they're terrible.
2702840	2705840	This idea that they're bad ass is not...
2705840	2713840	They're bullies, and then when they die,
2713840	2715840	they blow themselves up.
2715840	2717840	And then this idea that we were going to get off
2717840	2719840	on watching them fight aliens was like,
2719840	2720840	I thought was absurd.
2720840	2726840	Like, you like aliens.
2726840	2727840	Yeah, I like aliens.
2727840	2729840	But, I mean, I don't like aliens.
2729840	2730840	I like Sigourney Weaver.
2730840	2732840	I like humans.
2732840	2733840	I like humans.
2733840	2734840	That's why I like aliens.
2734840	2735840	Yeah, but you like aliens.
2735840	2737840	I mean, the movie is the aliens.
2737840	2739840	Yeah, well, that's the expensive part of the movie
2739840	2741840	you're making, but it's about people.
2741840	2744840	It's like saying, if I read The Old Man and the Sea,
2744840	2745840	then I like water.
2745840	2748840	You can't just make a book about water.
2748840	2750840	And it's sloshed, and it slipped.
2750840	2752840	And then it was hard to drink, and it gave you diarrhea.
2752840	2753840	I'm like, yeah, get on with it.
2753840	2755840	Where's the people?
2755840	2757840	This is about the unknown.
2757840	2759840	You can't just be like Freddy versus Jason.
2759840	2761840	I don't care.
2761840	2763840	Oh, Jason had a nightmare.
2763840	2765840	Are you fucking kidding me?
2765840	2768840	Next to LACC, where you guys shot Community,
2768840	2773840	there's a bra, like a lingerie shop called Jeanette's Bras.
2773840	2774840	And it's Jeanette.
2774840	2777840	What's her last name, Church?
2777840	2780840	She's Vasquez from Aliens.
2780840	2781840	Oh, OK.
2781840	2782840	Yeah.
2782840	2785840	She's the cool Latino hardcore marine in Aliens.
2785840	2787840	Played by a Jewish woman.
2787840	2791840	And now she sells panties and bras, and she's fucking awesome.
2791840	2795840	That's how I'm going out.
2795840	2800840	Bill Paxton in Predator 2 and Aliens 2.
2800840	2801840	Right?
2801840	2803840	Yep.
2803840	2805840	It's actually just called Aliens.
2805840	2807840	It's not called Aliens 2.
2807840	2811840	First one was called Alien, not Aliens 1.
2811840	2814840	Second one was called Aliens, not Aliens 2.
2814840	2815840	So you didn't know what I meant.
2815840	2816840	That's why you're so confused.
2816840	2817840	You didn't know what I meant.
2824840	2825840	Fucking shropped.
2825840	2826840	I shropped you.
2826840	2827840	You fucking put a mirror up.
2827840	2829840	You've been doing that for 20 years.
2829840	2830840	I get you.
2830840	2832840	Because you didn't know what I meant.
2832840	2834840	If you knew how to correct me, then you knew what I meant.
2834840	2836840	So why correct me?
2836840	2839840	Because it's a society trying to stitch it together.
2839840	2841840	It's just you and me, man.
2842840	2847840	What circumstances do the Predators uncloak in the movie?
2847840	2850840	Because what if they cloak as clothes?
2850840	2852840	That's just clothes to them, is cloaking.
2852840	2855840	Because they can see the color.
2855840	2859840	I always project into it that it probably is harder for them to see while they're cloaked.
2859840	2861840	Because otherwise, why would they ever uncloak?
2861840	2863840	Because of clothes, they'll be like flashing people.
2863840	2866840	You know what it's also hard for a Predator to do?
2866840	2869840	Pick up little tiny things with their long, clawy fingers.
2869840	2875840	Remember the first one where he's trying to repair his leg while he gets out?
2875840	2878840	And they do a close-up of him picking up stuff.
2878840	2882840	And he does that kind of mom-picking-up-of-pencils kind of thing.
2882840	2885840	He's like, oh, shit.
2885840	2887840	And it looks like...
2887840	2891840	It's very hard to see somebody if they get mud on them.
2891840	2896840	Schwarzenegger gets a little mud on them, and we're supposed to buy that.
2896840	2900840	You can turn yourself invisible, but you haven't defeated them.
2900840	2901840	Yeah, they should change that.
2901840	2902840	Mud technology.
2902840	2903840	Then they'd be famous.
2903840	2904840	Then they'd be famous.
2904840	2907840	Then it'd be a franchise.
2907840	2912840	Also, it's my understanding, you have to get to the copter or the skin you align.
2912840	2914840	The chopper.
2914840	2918840	Also, Jesse the body of Ventura was a governor.
2918840	2919840	Oh.
2919840	2921840	Yeah.
2921840	2922840	That's...
2922840	2924840	He was ordinary.
2924840	2925840	Yeah.
2925840	2926840	Two governors.
2926840	2927840	Two governors in one movie.
2927840	2931840	That movie has more governors than any other action film of all time.
2931840	2932840	Never thought about that.
2932840	2937840	I can't believe you're sitting so close to that fucking asshole.
2937840	2938840	You're probably friends with him.
2938840	2944840	You guys probably came in a group on...
2944840	2949840	Not since Jerry Brown and Dianne Feinstein were in...
2949840	2952840	The Expendables 4.
2952840	2953840	Ladybugs.
2953840	2954840	Right.
2955840	2960840	Yeah, I drive a Tesla.
2960840	2961840	Yeah.
2961840	2962840	Yeah.
2962840	2965840	You're welcome from Earth.
2965840	2968840	Do you drive it or do you just wreck it?
2968840	2969840	I barely drive it.
2969840	2972840	That's how fucking green I am.
2972840	2973840	I barely drive it.
2973840	2977840	I drive it back and forth to make an Emmy winning show for you.
2977840	2978840	It's completely...
2978840	2979840	It's all I do.
2979840	2981840	It's practically powered by the sun.
2981840	2982840	It's powered by...
2982840	2983840	It's elliptical.
2983840	2984840	Yeah.
2984840	2985840	That would be amazing.
2985840	2987840	We've got to get that set up.
2987840	2990840	You do the elliptical in the morning and it goes into like a big battery in your house
2990840	2993840	and then the battery is shared by like, I'm going to make some eggs.
2993840	2995840	Or like if you're rich, you express it through energy.
2995840	2996840	You go like, hey guys, it's Thanksgiving.
2996840	2998840	Come to my house because I have so many people working for me.
2998840	2999840	I'm always siphoning energy off of them.
2999840	3002840	I get a big like power wall in my house.
3002840	3004840	And then you like give the energy away.
3004840	3009840	You go like, here, desalinate some ocean water, neighbor.
3009840	3012840	Here, like here's a birth control for you.
3012840	3016840	Like everything, energy can be turned into anything.
3016840	3022840	So rich people just have these head pieces and they have gemstones in them based on like
3022840	3027840	how much you contribute to society.
3027840	3031840	Everybody gets a little Thanos gauntlet at birth.
3031840	3034840	And then like, you know how it goes.
3034840	3036840	Like I think we all know.
3036840	3038840	You know how it goes.
3038840	3041840	At the beginning of the universe, you know,
3041840	3046840	like everything, you know, nothing is split into everything, you know,
3046840	3048840	and then they were like these gems.
3048840	3052840	It's like, you know, the list is what you would imagine.
3052840	3062840	Power, time, soul, energy.
3062840	3063840	What the fuck?
3063840	3065840	I was like a third of the way through that list.
3065840	3067840	They have power and energy.
3067840	3068840	Yeah.
3068840	3069840	Oh, okay.
3069840	3071840	What the fuck with these gems?
3071840	3073840	So there's only four knuckles?
3073840	3074840	I don't know.
3074840	3077840	Like I was really disappointed in Thanos' gauntlet.
3077840	3079840	I really wanted it to be more comprehensive.
3079840	3083840	Like you don't have to make each thing part of someone's costume from a previous movie.
3083840	3086840	I think you could just say, just say gem one, gem two.
3086840	3090840	But show me that you're 20% more powerful when you get it.
3090840	3093840	Like you could beat up the Hulk with the first gem.
3094840	3095840	That just, okay.
3095840	3100840	To me, that's what I was defining coming into the movie is like you pretty much, you've peaked.
3100840	3104840	You just put a hurt on the Hulk.
3104840	3107840	Just beat his ass like he's a fucking drunk at a bar.
3107840	3109840	Like you just beat him up.
3109840	3110840	Throw him into space.
3110840	3112840	And then he's like, I've got to get the rest of those gems.
3112840	3114840	Why?
3114840	3116840	So I can kill exactly half of the people.
3116840	3118840	I don't even want to talk about it.
3118840	3119840	Can't wait.
3119840	3120840	I can't wait to see the sequel.
3120840	3126840	You know it would be a better movie if he's getting the gems, but he's just punching people to death as he goes.
3126840	3131840	He's just like, I'm going to punch out half of the world.
3131840	3135840	He's like punched out 60,000 people.
3135840	3143840	He punches a lot for a guy who, if he closes his fist, can make your grandma into a newspaper.
3144840	3150840	He's doing a lot of fucking Tai Chi considering that I would, I guess I'm a lazy supervillain.
3150840	3151840	I would just be like, so I can.
3151840	3152840	Okay.
3155840	3156840	Okay.
3156840	3157840	I got the green one from Dr. Strange.
3157840	3160840	So now from now on, then everything reverse all of it.
3160840	3162840	Quick save and then redo.
3162840	3163840	Yeah.
3163840	3169840	Well, that actually is Thanos's main weakness is that he always makes himself lose.
3169840	3172840	So that's just another one of those things he does.
3173840	3175840	Oh, that's his one weakness.
3175840	3179840	He's unbeatable except that he makes himself lose.
3180840	3181840	That's it.
3181840	3182840	That's one of his things.
3182840	3183840	Does it say that on his?
3183840	3184840	It says it on his card.
3184840	3185840	Yeah.
3185840	3186840	On his baseball card.
3189840	3190840	I just don't.
3190840	3191840	Yeah.
3191840	3193840	He, on his planet, he had an idea.
3193840	3194840	Everyone was like, God damn it.
3194840	3195840	There's not enough food.
3195840	3196840	So many people.
3196840	3199840	And he's like, look, I've been saying it forever.
3200840	3202840	Should kill half of the people.
3202840	3203840	Okay.
3203840	3204840	Thanos.
3204840	3205840	We've heard you the first time.
3205840	3207840	Like we're brainstorming here.
3207840	3210840	And while technically that means no wrong answers.
3210840	3212840	Fucking heard.
3212840	3213840	We heard you.
3213840	3216840	And it's going on the shit list.
3216840	3217840	We can beat it.
3217840	3218840	I hope.
3218840	3222840	Oh, you're going to regret this one.
3222840	3224840	What did he, where'd he go?
3224840	3226840	Is it why we're having another board meeting?
3226840	3227840	Where's Thanos?
3227840	3228840	He laughed.
3228840	3233840	When he joined the cosmos, he said he's going to do that thing that he wanted to do here,
3233840	3234840	everywhere.
3234840	3235840	Oh, great.
3235840	3236840	Great.
3236840	3237840	That really helps us.
3237840	3239840	He said, you guys don't believe in him.
3239840	3242840	I never said I don't believe you could do that.
3242840	3246840	I said it's a terrible idea.
3246840	3251840	Why is he so offended by the, with someone saying that that's a bad idea, that he's going
3251840	3253840	to go make it happen?
3253840	3256840	Put that much energy into making twice as much food.
3258840	3263840	How can I snap my fingers and everyone will have corn on the cob?
3263840	3266840	It's an equally valid solution.
3266840	3267840	You haven't seen it.
3267840	3269840	I haven't either.
3269840	3273840	What are you talking about?
3273840	3274840	It's Thanos.
3274840	3275840	It's this guy, Thanos.
3275840	3278840	He's a real bee in my bonnet.
3278840	3284840	His evil plan, it's just, it's hard to access for me.
3284840	3287840	I'm going to watch, I'm going to do this and then I'm going to watch the sunset on
3287840	3288840	the universe.
3288840	3290840	How does that happen?
3290840	3295340	Do you know anything about the universe or suns or setting?
3295340	3298680	I'm getting nervous because you're saying this stuff and you're wielding this power
3298680	3302840	and you just said you're going to watch the sunset on a grateful universe.
3302840	3307080	I want you to understand, it could be the solution, could be me explaining to you how
3307080	3309960	many people are in the universe.
3309960	3314280	I think you might think it's like Rhode Island and you're like, you just want it to sell
3314280	3316520	more shoes.
3316520	3319360	This could be a matter of perception.
3319360	3325320	Has anyone tried talking to this guy?
3325320	3327280	Why are Ron Porman's hands so soft?
3327280	3328680	That's my question.
3328680	3329680	Yeah, man.
3329680	3330680	That's, yeah.
3330680	3333280	Do you think, I don't think he wants people to know that.
3333280	3334280	I know.
3334280	3335280	But they were-
3335280	3336280	No one asked him about it on an AMA.
3336280	3339600	They were disturbingly just velvet.
3339600	3342440	There was a-
3342440	3343960	Disturbing being the operating word.
3343960	3344960	Yeah.
3344960	3345960	It was weird.
3345960	3346960	Hey, I'm Ron Perlman.
3346960	3349160	I'm starring in Hillboy 4 coming up.
3349160	3350160	Ask me anything.
3350160	3356200	Jeff Davis on Harmentown says, your hands are so soft, you're a piece of shit.
3356200	3357200	What the fuck?
3357200	3358200	I remember that guy.
3358200	3359200	What the fuck happened?
3359200	3360480	He seemed nice at the time.
3360480	3361480	Why does he-
3361480	3364840	Why does your Ron Perlman impression sound like Sugar Bear?
3364840	3365840	Hello, Jeff.
3365840	3366840	Hello, Jeff.
3366840	3367840	Jeff.
3367840	3368840	Hello, Jeff.
3369080	3370080	Jeff.
3370080	3371080	Hello.
3371080	3372080	Hey, this is Ron Perlman.
3372080	3374400	Why are you talking so much shit about me?
3374400	3376240	I didn't mean to talk any shit.
3376240	3377240	I was saying that your hands-
3377240	3380040	That was between you and me, the hand softness.
3380040	3381040	Hands.
3381040	3382040	Whoo.
3382040	3383040	Well, okay.
3383040	3389960	Well, since you got my number somehow, why are your hands so soft?
3389960	3390960	Clean living, man.
3390960	3391960	I don't know.
3391960	3392960	All right.
3392960	3394520	So, fuck you then.
3394520	3395520	Okay.
3395520	3397520	Fuck you, Ron Perlman with your soft ass hands.
3397520	3398520	All right.
3399200	3400200	All right.
3400200	3401200	I will.
3401200	3402200	All right.
3402200	3403200	I will.
3403200	3404200	Okay.
3404200	3405200	I will.
3405200	3406200	You'll fuck yourself.
3406200	3407200	Yeah.
3407200	3408200	Okay.
3408200	3409200	Okay.
3409200	3410200	Goodbye.
3410200	3411200	All right.
3411200	3412200	I'll see you at little Dom's at 7.30.
3412200	3413200	All right.
3413200	3414200	Thank you very much.
3414200	3415200	Ron?
3415200	3416200	You seem upset.
3416200	3417200	Why aren't you coming to bed?
3417200	3421440	Gildy, you have no idea what I've been through.
3421440	3424640	What is my job if not to hear your troubles and help lift you up?
3424640	3425640	Like, let me help you.
3425640	3426640	All right.
3426640	3427640	All right.
3427640	3429640	Let's go to the magic mirror.
3429640	3436360	And we have to recite the magic spell.
3436360	3437360	Take my hand.
3437360	3438360	Hello.
3438360	3439360	I'm the magic mirror.
3439360	3440360	All right.
3440360	3441360	Well, okay.
3441360	3442360	Okay.
3442360	3443360	Take it.
3443360	3444360	Take each other's hands and do the...
3444360	3445360	Oh.
3445360	3446360	Take my hand again.
3446360	3450720	So, to be clear, the mirror does not need to be started up.
3450720	3451720	Well, that's a scary thing.
3451720	3452720	That's a scary thing.
3452720	3453720	Wow.
3453720	3454720	It's already on.
3454720	3455720	Hey, wait.
3455720	3456720	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3456800	3458800	You should never turn it off.
3458800	3459800	Whoa.
3459800	3460800	Whoa.
3460800	3461800	Stop mirror-splaining.
3461800	3465480	Fucking hold each other's hands and fucking do your job.
3465480	3466480	Okay.
3466480	3467480	All right.
3467480	3468480	Okay.
3468480	3469480	Sorry.
3469480	3470480	I'm not going to just give you free mirror advice.
3470480	3471480	Okay.
3471480	3472480	All right.
3472480	3473480	Let's go.
3473480	3474480	Okay.
3474480	3475480	Let's hear a mirror on the shelf.
3475480	3476480	You fucking...
3476480	3477480	You guys...
3477480	3478480	You guys...
3478480	3479480	You guys...
3479480	3483160	Look, the pamphlet is right next to me.
3483160	3484480	You can just read the fucking instructions.
3484480	3485480	Go ahead.
3485480	3486480	Gildy.
3487120	3487520	You're gonna make it a little bit loud.
3487840	3488800	You wanted to...
3488800	3489800	All right.
3489800	3500600	Ron Drummond needs guidance.
3500600	3502600	Northwest.
3502600	3506840	East air.
3506840	3509640	West.
3509640	3512640	South.
3512640	3528880	Blood of baptized children, lymph nodes of virgin brides,
3529880	3534880	genitals of newt,
3540880	3547880	skin of trauma-ward patients.
3548880	3558880	These are the things we place in the cauldron now.
3563880	3565880	Okay, so mirror.
3565880	3570880	Just full disclosure, I'm just faculty, you guys, you can just ask me any questions.
3570880	3580880	But it's fun for a mirror to watch you guys do that.
3580880	3583880	What's your Ron Perlman questions, Ron Perlman?
3583880	3594880	My question, being Ron Perlman, is I'm known as a badass, I'm known as like Hellboy, I was in Blade II,
3594880	3598880	I'm usually a heavy, a gruff guy.
3598880	3599880	City of Lost Children.
3599880	3600880	City of Lost Children.
3600880	3601880	Alien 4.
3601880	3602880	Alien 4.
3602880	3603880	Resurrection.
3603880	3604880	Thank you, Gildy, thank you.
3604880	3609880	I've been cursed with these really soft hands.
3609880	3612880	Why is it a curse?
3612880	3618880	If I as a mirror can ask a question back at you guys, why do you even perceive soft hands as a curse?
3618880	3620880	Well, have you seen Reddit?
3620880	3623880	There's this person, Jeff Davis.
3623880	3625880	Oh, he's a fucking douchebag.
3625880	3629880	Whenever anyone shakes hands with Ron, do you mind me speaking for you?
3629880	3631880	No, it's embarrassing.
3631880	3635880	Whenever anyone shakes hands with him, they're so taken aback by the gentleness, and then they want to go tell it on the mountain,
3635880	3642880	and it takes on this heat that Ron's natural ruggedness doesn't take on, because that's the mainstay.
3642880	3646880	He exists as a creature of pure irony, and I don't think that's fair to Ron.
3646880	3655880	It's like we skipped the meat and potatoes of him being basically a real-life Paul Bunyan.
3655880	3659880	You're a really good girlfriend.
3659880	3662880	Look, it's no secret that I think Dan is Ron's manager.
3662880	3663880	Are you married?
3663880	3666880	I'm Rhea Pearlman.
3666880	3668880	You're Rhea Pearlman?
3668880	3672880	She's my ex-girlfriend, because I married her.
3672880	3673880	Well, this got complicated.
3673880	3675880	Gildy, Gildy, we...
3675880	3676880	Wait, I'm sorry.
3676880	3678880	Gilda, Gilda, sorry, you called me Gilda before.
3678880	3679880	Gilderia.
3679880	3680880	Gilderia.
3680880	3681880	Gildy.
3681880	3682880	Gilderia.
3682880	3683880	It's fine, yes.
3683880	3684880	Gilderia.
3684880	3685880	Forget the continuity.
3685880	3686880	Forget everything.
3686880	3688880	I didn't realize that Ron was married to Rhea Pearlman from Cheers.
3688880	3689880	I didn't know that.
3689880	3690880	Yeah.
3690880	3692880	I call her Gildy.
3692880	3693880	Okay.
3693880	3695880	We're past that.
3695880	3696880	I'm his manager.
3696880	3697880	Do you guys...
3697880	3699880	Fuck, yeah.
3699880	3702880	Dude, do you want to watch?
3702880	3704880	That's why we got the mirror, right?
3704880	3705880	Let's do it.
3705880	3706880	Okay.
3706880	3707880	Okay.
3707880	3708880	Here we go.
3708880	3709880	There's a reason you're on the ceiling.
3709880	3711880	Why don't you guys fuck in front of me so I can...
3711880	3718880	You guys can watch yourselves fuck me.
3718880	3719880	You're my reflection.
3719880	3720880	Okay.
3720880	3724880	Well, we've got about 10 minutes before the grubhub shows up, so let's do that.
3724880	3725880	Yeah.
3725880	3726880	All right.
3726880	3727880	Here we go.
3727880	3728880	All right.
3728880	3729880	Should I initiate?
3729880	3730880	Yes.
3730880	3731880	Okay.
3732880	3739880	Although asking that raises the question, who's initiating?
3739880	3742880	But yes, you should.
3742880	3743880	All right.
3743880	3744880	I'm going to take off my robe.
3744880	3745880	Check out these.
3745880	3746880	Okay.
3746880	3748880	Those look great, as always.
3748880	3749880	Excuse me.
3749880	3750880	Sorry.
3750880	3751880	All right.
3751880	3752880	Sorry.
3752880	3755880	Let's open the window and look out at the fucking tent city that exists on the perimeter
3755880	3757880	of our mansion.
3757880	3758880	What?
3758880	3759880	Hey.
3759880	3760880	Hey, guys.
3760880	3761880	Oh, my God.
3761880	3762880	Oh, shit.
3762880	3763880	It's David...
3763880	3764880	This is my grub.
3764880	3765880	David Duchovny.
3765880	3766880	Yeah, yeah.
3766880	3769680	You're delivering my green leaves?
3769680	3774640	I'm looking down into this puddle and I can see you through a mirror.
3774640	3775640	It's esoteric.
3775640	3776640	Oh, my God.
3776640	3779200	Well, that's not supposed to happen, is it?
3779200	3781520	Not unless time is reversed.
3781520	3785960	Mirror, did you reverse time and let David Duchovny see us through a puddle?
3785960	3787720	I reversed everything.
3787720	3789880	I guess so.
3790880	3793720	That's his thing.
3793720	3794720	That's what he does.
3794720	3795720	Yeah.
3795720	3796720	Start fucking real.
3796720	3798760	Well, hi, David.
3798760	3803080	It's me, Gilderia Pearlman.
3803080	3806120	We have agreed to start having sex in front of the mirror.
3806120	3807120	Yeah, yeah.
3807120	3808120	Please.
3808120	3811360	I assume you can look away if you don't want to watch it.
3811360	3812360	Don't record this.
3812360	3813360	Yeah, no.
3813360	3814360	Don't acknowledge me.
3814360	3817960	I don't like that part.
3817960	3821760	I invited some other mirrors over, so now it's like the end of Enter the Dragon with
3821760	3822760	Bruce Lee.
3822760	3825400	So you guys are all fucking in a hall of mirrors now.
3825400	3826400	Did a lot of mirrors just enter?
3826400	3827400	Sorry to interrupt.
3827400	3828400	Yeah.
3828400	3829400	Did a lot of mirrors just enter?
3829400	3830400	Yeah.
3830400	3831400	Yeah.
3831400	3832400	Look around.
3832400	3833400	That's bad.
3833400	3834400	Yeah.
3834400	3835400	See that guy?
3835400	3836400	Yeah.
3836400	3837400	That's you five times.
3837400	3838400	All right.
3838400	3839400	Well, here we go.
3839400	3840400	I'm initiating.
3840400	3843320	You wanted to initiate and you asked me.
3843320	3845400	I asked you what you thought of these and you...
3845400	3846400	Oh, yeah.
3846400	3847400	I think they're great.
3847520	3848520	Please.
3848520	3849520	Take a look at these.
3849520	3850520	What do you think?
3850520	3851520	Nice.
3851520	3852520	All right.
3852520	3853520	Nice.
3853520	3854520	Real good.
3854520	3855520	Would you give one a kiss?
3855520	3856520	Okay.
3856520	3857520	All right.
3857520	3862840	Now, let me give a part of you a kiss.
3862840	3863840	Okay.
3863840	3864840	What?
3864840	3865840	You can pick the part.
3865840	3866840	In between these.
3866840	3867840	Okay.
3867840	3868840	Oh, these are interesting.
3868840	3869840	All right.
3869840	3870840	Give him a kiss.
3870840	3871840	Yeah.
3871840	3872840	You like that?
3872840	3873840	Yeah.
3873840	3874840	Yeah.
3874840	3875840	Kiss a little more.
3875840	3876840	All right.
3877280	3879280	This sounds like you're more than I do.
3879280	3880280	Do you want me to kiss you?
3880280	3881280	Yeah.
3881280	3882280	Do you want me to...
3882280	3893080	I'm going to move to a different part of you and change the behavior but keep it administered
3893080	3894080	with my mouth.
3894080	3895080	Okay.
3895080	3896080	All right.
3896080	3897080	What about here?
3897080	3898080	What do you think of this?
3898080	3899080	That'd be okay.
3899080	3900080	All right.
3900080	3901880	I'll use some rapid fire kisses right here.
3901880	3902880	Okay.
3902880	3903880	Whoa.
3903880	3904880	Wow.
3904880	3905880	What do you think about that?
3905920	3907520	Now, why don't you, you know, like, look.
3907520	3908520	I just came.
3908520	3909520	Oh.
3909520	3910520	Okay.
3910520	3911520	All right.
3911520	3912520	Okay.
3912520	3913520	So, we're done.
3913520	3914520	All right.
3914520	3915520	Okay.
3915520	3916520	All right.
3916520	3917520	Okay.
3917520	3918520	Wow.
3918520	3919520	That was sexy.
3919520	3920520	That was hot.
3920520	3933360	That happens in America everywhere once a day.
3933360	3937320	When you reverse time, all right.
3937320	3938880	So, look.
3938880	3939880	It's been great.
3939880	3940880	Jesus Christ.
3940880	3941880	9-0-9.
3941880	3942880	Wow.
3942880	3943880	That's...
3943880	3944880	I usually...
3944880	3945880	Did you start at 7?
3945880	3946880	Oh, wait.
3946880	3947880	Wait.
3947880	3948880	Wait.
3948880	3949880	No.
3949880	3950880	We started at 8.
3950880	3951880	Yeah.
3951880	3952880	That's what I'm saying.
3952880	3953880	I'm telling you.
3953880	3954880	There's no escape from this.
3954880	3958560	I woke up at, like, fucking 5 a.m. in St. Paul, Minnesota this morning.
3958560	3959560	I'm so tired.
3959560	3961920	Well, then let's get the human alarm clock.
3961920	3962920	Steve Levy up here.
3963480	3964480	Okay.
3964480	3965480	Steve Levy.
3965480	3966480	You got one.
3966480	3967480	Steve Levy.
3967480	3968480	Steve Levy in the house.
3968480	3969480	All right.
3969480	3970480	Steve Levy.
3970480	3971480	You got...
3971480	3983160	You know, Rhea Perlman's married to Danny DeVito, right?
3983160	3984160	Yeah.
3984160	3985160	I know.
3985160	3986160	That was my joke.
3986160	3987160	Not anymore.
3987160	3988160	They're divorced.
3988160	3989160	Oh, boy.
3989160	3992200	I said, nobody gets me, and everyone railroads me, and I'm a victim of everything, and
3993200	4000000	I, you know, I have everything, and I'm also a victim of everything, and it's not easy
4000000	4001000	to balance those worlds.
4001000	4002000	I think you're killing it.
4002000	4003000	Thank you.
4003000	4004000	Thank you.
4004000	4005000	I think you're doing fantastic.
4005000	4006000	What's going on?
4006000	4014440	Dan, how long do you think, like, realistically, until your next scandal?
4014440	4015440	Don't answer that question.
4015440	4017440	I mean, does it matter?
4017440	4018440	Who cares?
4018440	4020360	Why would you ask that question?
4020360	4021360	Come on.
4021360	4023120	Why not ask it?
4023120	4024120	Who cares?
4024120	4026640	Why does it matter?
4026640	4027640	It's 9-11.
4027640	4028640	See?
4028640	4032800	It was only 10 seconds until your next scandal.
4032800	4033800	This is 9-09.
4033800	4034800	Steve Levy's top five sandwiches.
4034800	4035800	What?
4035800	4036800	All these are chaps.
4036800	4037800	All these are chaps tonight.
4037800	4038800	Yeah.
4038800	4039800	I think...
4039800	4047080	Well, I think it's a combination of, like, we moved into this theater space, so we can't
4047080	4051680	normally hear the people, so, like, whereas...
4051680	4055160	We used to have this thing at Meltdown where it's, like, you could hear everybody if they
4055160	4057040	cleared their throat, and so it'd be, like, somebody...
4057040	4061720	We'd go, like, I'm gonna talk about dolphins, and then somebody would be, like, that's not
4061720	4062720	true.
4062720	4063800	And it'd be, like, hey, come up here.
4063800	4064800	And then it's, like...
4064800	4067720	And then we moved here, and it's, like, a theater, so it's not designed for that.
4067720	4073760	And so now what's happening is, like, this Darwinian mutation of, like, super asses, like,
4074760	4079560	like, god damn it, I've said shit under my breath, like, 90 times, it's, like, if you
4079560	4084840	don't take all your antibiotics, you create, like, a fucking flu monster.
4084840	4092040	So now you just have three people going, like, god damn it, fuck, gobots, gobots!
4092040	4098600	My name is Paul Davidson, I'm from Minnesota, talk about gobots!
4098600	4103280	I'm happy to come up if you want!
4103280	4104480	I think it's exactly...
4104480	4109120	I think it's just, like, latter day Adam Goldberg, because I just want to, like, barge the way
4109120	4110120	on stage.
4110120	4111320	But what's the alternative?
4111320	4115440	Hey, keep it down, there's a show going on up here.
4115440	4121320	I can't say that, I'm on their side, this is a fucking shit show, I'd heckle it, too.
4121320	4125840	If I was sitting out there, I'd be like, can I come up?
4125840	4126840	Garbage up here.
4126840	4127840	A bunch of jackasses.
4127840	4133160	I've got eyeballs, there's three guys in a row that have the same beard, there's, like,
4133160	4136080	a weird kind of Three Musketeers thing happening.
4136080	4140080	That means you can only see three people, because our whole audience has the same beard.
4140080	4141080	Yeah.
4141080	4142080	It's these guys.
4142080	4148200	We can't understand you, we can't understand you!
4148200	4153160	You have to take workshops to speak to other people, you have to...
4153160	4161160	It takes things, it takes architecture, it takes training, you have to project, I can't
4162160	4163160	understand you!
4163160	4168600	Oh, and you don't know timing either, no one will ever understand what you're saying.
4168600	4173000	I don't even think understanding is the problem, I think if we understood him, then there'd
4173000	4177160	just be a whole host of new problems.
4177160	4186120	I know that, I know that, for sure, I am not, but the fact that there's a membrane there
4186120	4189560	where it's just like, I can't even...
4189560	4194560	No one can even tell what you're saying, shouldn't that stop you?
4194560	4195560	Yeah.
4195560	4201760	Like, an animal wants to eat more grass over there, and then there's, like, barbed wire
4201760	4207440	that goes into their forehead, and they're like...
4207440	4214200	It doesn't mean the farmer's trying to keep you from being a super cow.
4214200	4220920	This farm might love you, it just wants you to be you and make the most milk possible.
4220920	4221920	Yeah.
4221920	4226880	And isn't that the super-est cow of all?
4226880	4231880	My dad used to heckle at church.
4231880	4237040	So, what's an example?
4237040	4238120	That's no good.
4238120	4241480	He came to Harman Town a couple times, and I would hear him, like, yell out and stuff,
4241480	4243040	and I'd be like, this is the fucking...
4243040	4244960	This is just church round two.
4244960	4245960	It's so bad.
4245960	4246960	What would he say?
4246960	4247960	Do you remember anything?
4247960	4248960	Like, here we go.
4248960	4249960	Well, what is a heckler?
4249960	4250960	More like eight days.
4250960	4251960	Yeah, exactly like that.
4251960	4259960	I'd take more of a rest if I made that world.
4259960	4264520	Yeah, it's all just, like, he'd be all like, oh, yeah, Mark would say, and then he'd be
4264520	4265520	like, you mean Matt?
4265520	4268560	You know, like, just stupid, like, literally heckling church.
4268560	4271440	What would the pastor do when he'd go...
4271440	4272440	Nothing.
4272440	4273440	Mm-hmm.
4273440	4274440	Moving on.
4274440	4275440	No.
4275440	4276800	It never broke any rhythms.
4276800	4278680	There was never enough speed.
4278680	4280840	That's what she spake.
4280840	4284000	Thus, so she spake.
4284000	4290960	When I was 25, if I was a pastor, and I had a guy like your dad in the audience, or congregation,
4290960	4295000	whatever you'd call the audience, that's like...
4295000	4296000	That would be my technique.
4296000	4297000	I'd be like, hey, come on, get up here.
4297000	4298000	Come on, what are you doing?
4298000	4301400	You know, like, come on, what were you saying?
4301400	4302400	And that would take care of me.
4302400	4304400	That's what you do here.
4304400	4309600	Yeah, but it's not punitive here.
4309600	4314880	I've always said from the beginning, as Caleb will remind us, because he's had to listen
4314880	4318360	to every episode, I, from the beginning, have always been like, I don't want to do that
4318360	4319360	here.
4319360	4320360	I don't want to have that relationship with the audience.
4320360	4323520	I want to have a Paula Poundstone relationship with the audience, where it's like, she had
4323520	4329400	her Showtime show, and she would just have guests, and she was a regular person, and
4329400	4330400	they were regular people.
4330400	4334920	And I would always be like, hey, does anybody want to come up here and talk to us, and we
4334920	4337560	won't hurt you, we won't bully you, it's a safe place.
4337560	4343080	And that was coinciding with a cultural shift in things and stuff.
4343080	4344080	I've always meant that.
4344080	4346640	I always just wanted to have that relationship with the audience.
4346640	4348200	You piece of shit, you fucker.
4348200	4349200	I'm kidding.
4349200	4350200	I'm kidding.
4350200	4351200	I'm kidding.
4352200	4355080	I keep making eye contact with you about the Lexus thing, and I don't care.
4355080	4356080	I don't really care.
4356080	4361320	And the thing I don't, when I say I don't care, I mean, you're not allowed to come up
4361320	4364920	to me ever and go, I was that guy, now let's talk about that.
4364920	4366720	Don't do that.
4366720	4369960	This did not make us friends, but I don't hate you.
4369960	4370960	Who is the guy?
4370960	4371960	It doesn't matter.
4371960	4372960	It doesn't matter.
4372960	4373960	It's the important thing.
4373960	4374960	It's all been a bit.
4374960	4375960	Is it you or your instinct?
4375960	4376960	The yes shirt?
4376960	4380160	That was the one thing, like, always, when I was coming up, I was living with the guys
4380160	4382040	behind you, but it was you.
4382040	4383040	Who cares?
4383040	4384040	What are you going to...
4384040	4385040	See, right?
4385040	4386040	We don't want to...
4386040	4387040	This is not information.
4387040	4388040	It doesn't care.
4388040	4389040	No, this doesn't.
4389040	4390040	We don't want to...
4390040	4391040	Why do we care?
4391040	4392040	That's it.
4392040	4393040	Yeah.
4393040	4394040	What are we doing?
4394040	4395040	Bring someone up.
4395040	4396040	See?
4396040	4397040	No.
4397040	4398040	No.
4398040	4407040	Let's bring up Caleb for his 21st birthday.
4407120	4408120	See, a guy...
4408120	4416960	I couched out, some knave said, bring someone up, and that person, you know, who is that?
4416960	4417960	We keep...
4417960	4420960	My name is Denver.
4420960	4425800	I can't stay mad at you assholes.
4425800	4426800	Or maybe I can't.
4426800	4427800	I can start to get mad.
4427800	4428800	Is it Caleb?
4428800	4429800	Like C-A-L-E-B?
4429800	4430800	That's the one, yeah.
4430800	4431800	How's it going, man?
4431800	4432800	21 years old.
4432800	4433800	Never better.
4433800	4434800	It was your 21st birthday.
4434800	4436360	Not today, but just, yeah, a couple weeks ago.
4436760	4437760	Oh, okay.
4437760	4438760	This...
4438760	4441760	No, don't...
4441760	4442760	Security!
4442760	4443760	Trying to make...
4443760	4444760	Believe these people.
4444760	4445760	Trying to...
4445760	4446760	Like, they're so...
4446760	4447760	This is my fault.
4447760	4448760	That's how desperate for entertainment they are.
4448760	4449760	That's not your fault.
4449760	4450760	They're like, oh, David Goliath!
4450760	4453760	I'm like, no, nothing's happened.
4453760	4457640	Yeah, but like you said, you took a...
4457640	4460520	It's a solo trip you treated yourself to for your birthday.
4460520	4463920	Yeah, I was broke as fuck for the last year or so, and then I recently...
4463920	4464920	Hell yeah.
4464920	4468440	I was a former, and I just turned 21 at the end of August, and so I decided, now that
4468440	4473360	I'm not broke as fuck, I'm gonna make myself broke as fuck by going to L.A.
4473360	4477500	And now, don't think that you have to lie to us, because actually, we'd feel better
4477500	4481400	if the answer is no, but did you come out here just for this show?
4481400	4483200	That was like 90% of the reason I came out.
4483200	4484200	Yeah.
4484200	4485200	Absolutely.
4485200	4493760	So we feel a little bad, but I mean, that's probably the highest honor that people make
4493760	4494760	these pilgrimages.
4495600	4498240	I don't know, there's something about doing it alone, too.
4498240	4503880	I don't know the people that do it with a partner that makes it...
4503880	4504880	It's just something...
4504880	4506320	There's something holy about that.
4506320	4508920	You really are just like, I have a relationship with this show.
4508920	4509920	I'm getting in my car.
4509920	4512240	I'm driving out here.
4512240	4513560	Can we learn more about you?
4513560	4515880	What do you wanna know?
4515880	4516880	I don't know.
4516880	4517880	You work for the government?
4517880	4518880	Are we gonna get fired?
4518880	4521040	I actually was just working for the government.
4521040	4522040	No, I'm fine.
4522040	4523040	I'm unemployed right now.
4523240	4526480	What was this thing you were doing that ended with you being broke as fuck?
4526480	4531560	I was working a really, really shitty job, and that's when I started listening to this
4531560	4536200	because I knew I loved Rick and Morty and community, and so I was just, hey, I need
4536200	4538360	to listen to something while I'm working these 12-hour shifts.
4538360	4543680	I wanna listen to this guy who can relate to me, this guy who...
4543680	4549840	But whatever you're comfortable telling us about the job that you were doing.
4549840	4552680	I signed a contract saying I wouldn't say much about it.
4552680	4558080	Actually I was just a machinist, and it was a really shitty thing, but I was incredibly
4558080	4559080	unhappy.
4559080	4561760	God, the imagination runs wild.
4561760	4566240	It just means you were making a nuclear bomb.
4566240	4567560	It's all that could ever be.
4567560	4570160	Caleb, was it like aerospace or...?
4570160	4571640	No, nobody gives a fuck about me.
4571640	4573240	I was building the first bullet truck.
4573240	4574240	No, no, don't violate.
4574240	4575240	Steve's here.
4575240	4576240	No.
4576240	4577240	Hey, Steve.
4577240	4578240	How you doing?
4578240	4579240	Rob, you know, don't.
4579240	4580240	I'm trying.
4580240	4584440	You came up on stage, like what, 45 minutes ago?
4584440	4585440	Just sat here.
4585440	4586440	I got you.
4586440	4587440	Oh, yeah, that's right.
4587440	4588440	You came up on stage.
4588440	4593360	I can't thank God Rob's here, or we wouldn't get to the bottom of the fact that the show's
4593360	4597120	not scripted, and that mistakes are made.
4597120	4602080	I followed the flow, and I thought I wound up somewhere hot, but here you are with your
4602080	4607320	fucking ice breath, cool it down.
4607320	4611280	Let's all stop and notice how it's not as hot as we thought, as he was making it.
4611280	4613880	I'm fucking heating shit up over here.
4613880	4617040	You come in with that shit, that Mentos shit.
4617040	4618040	Who cares about him?
4618040	4620240	I pay him.
4620240	4621240	Caleb came out here.
4621240	4622800	He paid us.
4622800	4624800	Cool it, brother.
4624800	4628040	Now, no pressure.
4628040	4629360	Please tell us about...
4629360	4631840	No, I was just working as a machinist.
4631840	4636280	I was basically building circuit boards for different, like whether it was Google or other
4636280	4638400	entities that I'm not allowed to talk about.
4638400	4639400	Probably not Yahoo.
4639400	4640400	Oh, yeah.
4640400	4641400	Okay.
4641400	4643080	Not after, you know, they bought.
4643080	4644080	And probably not Bing.
4644080	4645080	I mean, they're probably not.
4645080	4651400	I was working at the Bing campus.
4651400	4658920	If you don't know where it is, Google it.
4658920	4663000	But I was just working that really shitty job, and I became like...
4663000	4664720	That was literally the only reason...
4664720	4668000	This show is the only reason that I made it through there.
4668000	4672880	Not to sound like melodramatic or to exaggerate, but this is literally the only reason I made
4672880	4675360	it out of there alive.
4675360	4676360	Like genuinely.
4676360	4678360	No, I'm not trying to sound stupid.
4678360	4680360	I take that for what it's worth.
4680360	4686880	I have a relationship with so many podcasts, and I take that exactly, I think, as much
4686880	4691000	of a compliment and as little as I need.
4692000	4693000	It took me a while to get to that zone.
4693000	4694920	I'm like, you want to deflect it, or you want to accept it?
4694920	4698920	But it doesn't necessarily denote merit.
4698920	4699920	It's gratitude.
4699920	4700920	You know?
4700920	4707040	Like, I feel gratitude when people say, oh, I was going through this or that, and then
4707040	4711520	your show was there, and I grabbed it, and I held on to it, and it kept me from drowning.
4711520	4717120	And you go like, oh, man, that's so fucking amazing that I get to make that contact with
4717120	4718120	you.
4718120	4719120	It has nothing to do.
4719120	4723040	Looking at 35, I'd be like, yeah, well, you know, it's basically just a ripoff of MASH.
4723040	4727240	I mean, I'd start talking, and I'm like, well, I don't know what...
4727240	4731640	A person's basically telling you, for instance, not what you're telling them, like, oh, yeah,
4731640	4738520	they're sort of dog whistling that maybe they were going to commit suicide, and you're like,
4738520	4745640	this is not a time for you to be talking someone out of something.
4745640	4751200	You're getting caught up in whether what you do makes you a good person or a bad person.
4751200	4755440	So this isn't about me.
4755440	4756440	But I can't believe...
4756440	4759480	Yeah, you just listened to all 300 and something episodes.
4759480	4762040	I asked Nova this.
4762040	4767560	He came up last week, or about two weeks ago, and we talked about it, and they came up,
4767560	4771400	goddamn it, goddamn it, Harmon, get your shit together.
4771400	4778600	Nova came up a couple weeks ago, and we interrogated them, and just give us a little bit of a...
4778600	4779600	What do you want out of the podcast?
4779600	4783520	What do you get out of it so that we can keep customer satisfaction going?
4783520	4784520	Yeah.
4784520	4789400	Now that I know I can't really talk about what I feel, tell me what I should talk about.
4789400	4790400	Hot dog prices?
4790400	4791400	What the fuck?
4791400	4796200	No, honestly, it's just...
4796200	4800400	These hot dog prices, though, are they up or are they down?
4800400	4802520	Hot dog.
4802520	4805120	So I get out...
4805120	4811120	I really, really admire your honesty, everybody on stage, and I just...
4811120	4816640	As somebody who is extremely lonely in this dead-end job, I ended up quitting that because
4816640	4817640	I needed to.
4817640	4819640	That's why I was broke as fuck.
4819640	4825960	Anyway, I get out of it a lot of camaraderie, and while it is interesting hearing about your
4826960	4829960	day-to-day lives, God fuck, I'm so stupid.
4829960	4830960	Sorry, it's fine.
4830960	4831960	It's fine.
4831960	4832960	It's good.
4832960	4833960	You're me.
4833960	4834960	You're me.
4834960	4835960	You're me.
4835960	4836960	It's fine.
4836960	4838960	Your day-to-day lives as these huge celebrities, these Emmy winners...
4838960	4839960	Sorry, Rob.
4839960	4840960	Oh!
4840960	4841960	Oh!
4841960	4842960	Oh!
4842960	4845960	And he looks like the Oscar.
4845960	4846960	Oh!
4846960	4847960	Oh!
4847960	4852960	He does look the most like the Oscar out of anybody.
4853960	4856960	And the Emmy for looking like an Oscar goes to...
4863960	4864960	It's family.
4864960	4866960	It's camaraderie.
4866960	4869960	It would kill you.
4869960	4871960	I feel that way about podcasts.
4871960	4876960	We have October 1st, David Cummings is out here coming out here from the No Sleep podcast.
4876960	4883960	I don't even know how to feel about that, because it's like for the last three months,
4883960	4886960	Cody and I just press play on this guy.
4886960	4893960	It's like, you just hear this guy and this whole coterie of people who do this No Sleep
4893960	4896960	podcast, and that's what podcast is.
4896960	4900960	It's about addiction to a family unit.
4900960	4901960	Yeah, absolutely.
4901960	4907960	It's kind of odd how all the way across the fucking continent, you can just form a genuine
4907960	4910960	relationship with this person that you've never met, heard of, or anything like that,
4910960	4915960	just because of things that don't matter that they just say into a microphone.
4915960	4920960	And it's a proper safe, healthy one, because it's through a sheet of plexiglass,
4920960	4924960	because you could get hurt otherwise.
4924960	4932960	It's like, oh, you know, visiting humanity through a prison.
4932960	4936960	You get the phone and then you can go like, you know, the lawyer comes and they make the gesture,
4936960	4939960	you get a phone and go, hey, man, you can get as intimate as you want then,
4939960	4942960	and go like, how are you doing in there, big sister?
4942960	4950960	You put your hand on the glass and like, yeah, like, it seems appropriate to me.
4950960	4953960	To me, I like that.
4953960	4954960	Mind if I have a drink?
4954960	4956960	Yeah, please, God, where are my manners?
4956960	4957960	I'm so sorry.
4957960	4959960	I'm very sorry about that.
4959960	4962960	Sorry, Caleb.
4962960	4967960	Only because, like, we make new friends up here.
4967960	4969960	Goddamn it.
4969960	4972960	You piece of shit, horrible person.
4972960	4973960	They put a pox on your family.
4973960	4974960	I don't.
4974960	4975960	I don't.
4975960	4976960	I don't put a pox on your family.
4976960	4978960	That's a joke.
4978960	4980960	I don't have that power, and if I did, I wouldn't use it.
4980960	4982960	Which guy with which beard is doing this?
4982960	4986960	Spencer and I both agree that what you're doing there is wrong.
4986960	4991960	It's like, just tell me what your purpose is.
4991960	4993960	I just want eyeballs on who's doing the thing.
4993960	4996960	And then once that happens, then what?
4996960	4998960	I'm going to hurt their feelings.
4998960	5001960	Well, just hurt their feelings in general.
5001960	5003960	Who was the last one?
5003960	5004960	All right.
5004960	5007960	Shut the fuck up.
5007960	5011960	It's a good thing we looked right at him.
5011960	5015960	We're being loud up here for no reason already.
5015960	5019960	But also, especially when there's another person up here, because they don't have the...
5019960	5022960	It's like there's a building on fire, and they're like,
5022960	5023960	holy shit, it's hot.
5023960	5025960	You don't know how it affects them.
5025960	5026960	You don't know what it's like.
5026960	5028960	It just sounds like you're screaming me, me, me.
5028960	5029960	I want to be on stage.
5029960	5031960	Well, that's what heckling is.
5031960	5032960	Well, I'm not going to...
5032960	5035960	Without impugning you guys, I just want to say,
5035960	5037960	I just use my I statements and say,
5038960	5041960	that sound first hits you, if you're a decent person,
5041960	5045960	it first hits you as shame.
5045960	5048960	If somebody's like...
5048960	5051960	The first thing I hear is like, you're fucking up, you're fucking up.
5051960	5053960	That's the first thing I hear.
5053960	5057960	I have to reprocess it through a series of calluses.
5057960	5059960	If you're going to shout something out from the audience,
5059960	5062960	it has to be fucking cogent or delightful.
5062960	5063960	It has to be fucking awesome.
5063960	5066960	The catch-22 is if you're going to shout something out from the audience,
5066960	5069960	you have to be the kind of person who doesn't shout something out
5069960	5070960	from the audience.
5070960	5071960	Right.
5071960	5075960	Which is really important because, yeah.
5075960	5077960	And that's like...
5077960	5079960	Because of the thing is you're fucking...
5079960	5081960	Digging deep into a topic that we're like, oh my God.
5081960	5083960	The thing is that you're fucking up and I don't enjoy the show,
5083960	5085960	and then fucking go away.
5085960	5086960	Just walk around and go.
5086960	5087960	Well, now we sound defensive.
5087960	5088960	They are enjoying it.
5088960	5090960	No one wants to watch a bunch of defensive people.
5090960	5094960	No, I'm on the offense right now.
5094960	5096960	That's what defensive people are.
5096960	5098960	I will start actively hurting people's feelings.
5098960	5102960	Anyways, Caleb, so what's it like to get a hard-on constantly?
5102960	5103960	Oh, it's the best.
5103960	5104960	Oh, yeah.
5104960	5105960	It's the best.
5105960	5107960	It's a double-edged sword for sure.
5107960	5111960	Actually, but that's the one...
5111960	5112960	That's the one thing that I don't...
5112960	5113960	That youth thing.
5113960	5115960	Like, I actually...
5115960	5116960	Yeah, it's not about me.
5116960	5117960	I keep...
5117960	5119960	I want to ask you youth questions.
5119960	5121960	21, 21, 21.
5121960	5122960	Just turn 21.
5122960	5123960	Yes, sir.
5123960	5125960	I'm going to take the way back machine.
5125960	5127960	I want to ask you a 21 question.
5127960	5128960	Knees.
5128960	5129960	What?
5129960	5130960	Knees.
5130960	5131960	You got knees?
5131960	5132960	Oh, your knees.
5132960	5136960	What's it like to have knees that you feel like you could just jump over anything?
5136960	5137960	Well, I'm...
5137960	5138960	They just exist, right?
5138960	5141960	Like, is there anything that you would look at and you'd be like,
5141960	5144960	I could jump over that if I wanted?
5144960	5147960	Like, barely that cord running on the ground.
5147960	5148960	All right.
5148960	5149960	He's humble.
5149960	5150960	I'm a Harmon fan.
5150960	5152960	I'm not an athlete.
5152960	5158960	I think there might be a...
5158960	5159960	This might be a line of...
5159960	5160960	You might be pointing out a thing.
5160960	5164960	Like, I think we might be doing some kind of reverse discrimination thing
5164960	5167960	because I'm looking at you for the listeners that aren't subscribers
5167960	5168960	that can't see.
5168960	5174960	Caleb, he's got an Ashton Kutcher dude wears my car kind of body.
5174960	5177960	He looks like he could fucking pull you out of a burning car
5177960	5180960	and your baby and, like, throw you onto the...
5181960	5183960	I pull babies out of cars all the time.
5183960	5185960	And so maybe we're kind of, like, gang up,
5185960	5188960	but you could have that body, especially a 21,
5188960	5191960	and be like, yeah, I like checkers.
5191960	5193960	And we're like, yeah, but where's your dick?
5193960	5194960	Like, show us your dick.
5194960	5198960	How much you like to fuck with your hard dick and jump over shit?
5198960	5200960	And that's not fair.
5200960	5202960	That's, like, a weird thing.
5202960	5204960	Oh, I actually... I got a question.
5204960	5209960	How much do you like to fuck stuff with your hard dick and jump over shit?
5209960	5212960	Spencer, were you listening to anything I just said?
5212960	5215960	No, you're just living vicariously through me, yeah.
5215960	5217960	See, now I'm on the heckler side.
5217960	5219960	I'm going to go sit down there with...
5219960	5220960	Well, guys...
5220960	5222960	See, this is my... that's what I suspected.
5222960	5227960	Caleb, what's your fantasy... not job, like, I don't know,
5227960	5230960	like, kind of like, like, Desert Island.
5230960	5234960	250 of us were on a jet.
5234960	5236960	Crashed.
5236960	5238960	There's luminaries like me at the front.
5238960	5239960	Yeah, of course.
5239960	5246960	So, obviously, I'm going to have, like, a begrudgingly administrative position.
5246960	5248960	Let me thrust upon you.
5248960	5250960	It's just going to be, like, people are going to look to me,
5250960	5252960	like, even people that weren't familiar with me before,
5252960	5254960	they're going to be, as they are at an airplane.
5254960	5255960	Word's going to have spread.
5255960	5258960	There's a guy in the fire, Rick and Morty community in the fire.
5258960	5259960	With such humility.
5259960	5260960	I don't know what that is.
5260960	5262960	Like, well, yeah, well, that's not going to impress anybody once.
5262960	5263960	The wing flies off this fucking plane.
5263960	5265960	This guy has two non-televised Emmys.
5265960	5266960	Yeah.
5267960	5270960	So, no, the first one was very televised.
5270960	5271960	Very televised.
5271960	5274960	I never bring it up, but my first Emmy was for writing the Oscars.
5274960	5275960	Very televised.
5275960	5276960	Thank you very much.
5276960	5277960	All right.
5277960	5279960	So, we crash on the island and people are like,
5279960	5282960	I'm just taking myself off the plate because I don't want you to say,
5282960	5283960	hey, are you on the plane?
5283960	5286960	Because if so, I want to give you your space.
5286960	5290960	I want to leave, I want to allow you the space to claim things
5290960	5292960	that maybe you think I would do.
5292960	5295960	Just do what I want and do what I think I do it well.
5295960	5297960	And your fantasy, it's like a village.
5297960	5299960	We're never getting rescued, ever.
5299960	5303960	So, all that's going to happen is it's 200 people.
5303960	5304960	We're starting a village.
5304960	5307960	Are you a self-proclaimed fancy pants guy?
5307960	5309960	No, it's because he's a figure of import.
5309960	5311960	I'm taking myself off the table.
5311960	5313960	I didn't want him to say, well, Dan,
5313960	5318960	I don't want to say that what I'd like to do is write amazing things
5318960	5320960	that make everyone happy every night.
5322960	5324960	I don't want him to assume that that's what I'd be doing.
5324960	5327960	I'd be so busy managing everyone.
5327960	5329960	I'd be like, everyone, calm down.
5329960	5330960	It's okay.
5330960	5331960	I'm sure we'll get rescued.
5331960	5333960	Because you're a man of the people.
5333960	5336960	Yeah, and I have a radio to sabotage
5336960	5337960	because I don't want to get rescued.
5337960	5339960	I have 200 people liking me.
5341960	5342960	My plate is full.
5342960	5344960	I'm describing my fantasy.
5344960	5347960	I'm not going to want to write a lot.
5347960	5349960	Please, let's find out.
5349960	5353960	Caleb, you're in a tribal situation.
5353960	5355960	It's never going to end.
5355960	5360960	Day by day, you're waking up, in the most tribal sense,
5360960	5363960	if your archetype was what?
5363960	5366960	You can express that in any language you want,
5366960	5368960	whether it's an actual job that exists
5368960	5371960	or just be like, I would like to be the guy that blah, blah, blah,
5371960	5373960	whatever, go from there.
5373960	5376960	Yeah, well, in that fantasy land,
5376960	5381960	I would probably want to be some kind of mentor
5381960	5383960	or teacher to this tribe.
5383960	5387960	I think education, whether it's like talking about math, science,
5387960	5389960	all that shit, and that's bullshit.
5389960	5393960	You know, education should be, in my opinion,
5393960	5394960	mostly about morality.
5394960	5397960	And I don't think a lot of teachers or a lot of people realize that,
5397960	5399960	especially not enough to put it into play.
5399960	5401960	Well, it's kind of a priest you're describing then
5401960	5403960	because you're saying you want to be a mentor.
5403960	5404960	Well, don't laugh.
5404960	5406960	I'm not like, gotching him.
5406960	5408960	You're saying like, fuck science and math,
5408960	5412960	but hallelujah to like guiding and teaching.
5412960	5416960	I mean, not that those things aren't important because they are.
5416960	5418960	But really, I think, you know,
5418960	5422960	a lot of the reason that the U.S. is in a state of shambles right now,
5422960	5424960	in case you haven't noticed.
5424960	5429960	I've never heard you talk about it for several long time.
5429960	5434960	I kind of unplugged from, is America still in shambles?
5434960	5435960	I haven't checked in.
5435960	5445960	I would like to be the guy that wrangles the monkeys.
5445960	5450960	Because they're going to get into our stuff.
5450960	5454960	And somebody's just got to be on top of that.
5454960	5455960	I want to be that.
5455960	5457960	Spencer's going to be...
5457960	5459960	I want to build stuff.
5459960	5464960	Spencer's going to build like a school for the monkeys.
5464960	5466960	Well, right?
5466960	5468960	Yeah.
5468960	5473960	And in this school, you'll teach them how to build more schools.
5473960	5474960	Monkey schools.
5474960	5478960	I'm going to coach a monkey improv troop.
5478960	5479960	Okay.
5479960	5480960	All right.
5480960	5482960	This is really work.
5482960	5483960	Steve!
5483960	5484960	Oh my God, Steve's here.
5484960	5485960	Steve, leave me.
5485960	5487960	The human alarm clock.
5487960	5489960	The human alarm clock.
5489960	5492960	What do you want to do on the island?
5492960	5493960	I just want to interject there.
5493960	5496960	Steve's not allowed to choose that.
5496960	5502960	If we're on the same plane, he still has to work for me.
5502960	5504960	But okay, Steve, if you want to answer the question...
5504960	5507960	So I guess then I would continue being a human alarm clock.
5507960	5511960	So in the morning, I wake up and go like cock-a-doodle-doo or something.
5511960	5513960	I don't know how you want to phrase it.
5513960	5514960	Yeah.
5514960	5515960	Whatever.
5515960	5516960	Okay.
5516960	5517960	All right.
5517960	5518960	Take me out of the picture.
5518960	5521960	It's a different island from me.
5522960	5525960	I'd either want to be probably like a chef.
5525960	5526960	Yeah.
5526960	5530960	Like learn how to cook with all the things I have, which is probably very little.
5530960	5531960	Holy shit.
5531960	5532960	Wow.
5532960	5533960	Curious.
5533960	5534960	Just curious.
5534960	5535960	Well, it's just amazing.
5535960	5536960	You crash on an island.
5536960	5537960	Or a real...
5537960	5540960	I mean, sanitation is going to happen, right?
5540960	5541960	Isn't that a big problem?
5541960	5542960	Wait, wait, wait.
5542960	5545960	He's got a good point.
5545960	5547960	He's got a good point.
5547960	5550960	You guys don't know Steve has a passion for sanitation.
5551960	5553960	This guy fucking loves this shit.
5553960	5554960	We're going to need it.
5554960	5557960	I just try to help society waste water.
5557960	5563960	You're an anarchist dream because anarchists philosophically need to assert the idea philosophically
5563960	5568960	that if we were in a tribal situation, there would be someone that would be more than willing
5568960	5574960	to handle getting the shit away from the food and that it would all work out.
5574960	5575960	Yeah.
5575960	5581960	The dream is that during the day, I'm preparing all the food and at night I'm...
5581960	5582960	Uh-oh.
5582960	5583960	Get the shit out of here.
5583960	5585960	This might be kind of doomed.
5585960	5586960	All right.
5586960	5589960	I think you're overextending yourself a little bit.
5589960	5590960	I'm worried about you.
5590960	5593960	You know what I'm going to do?
5593960	5594960	I saved my slot.
5594960	5599960	I'll be your therapist because I think you need to overcome your workaholism.
5599960	5600960	Okay.
5600960	5604960	And I would love to wake up every morning and go, if I do nothing else today and I won't,
5604960	5607960	I'm going to help Steve Levy relax.
5607960	5609960	That all tracks for me?
5609960	5615960	I would wake up every day if my job was to meet with you on a beach and be like, like,
5615960	5617960	hey, man, how you doing?
5617960	5621960	I would, like, every day I would be willing to, like, have you sit down in front of me
5621960	5623960	and go, how did it go today?
5623960	5627960	And you tell me stuff and then I would be like, you know, you shouldn't let that get you down
5627960	5631960	and all this stuff like I just, like, babbling at you about how you should feel.
5631960	5632960	I'd love that job.
5633960	5634960	Thanks.
5634960	5635960	Yeah.
5635960	5637960	I would love to be a part of that.
5637960	5638960	Yeah.
5638960	5641960	But I think I'm competing with you for that job because you're kind of like, you and I
5641960	5643960	are both saying the same thing.
5643960	5644960	Caleb.
5644960	5645960	I'm talking to Caleb.
5645960	5649960	Like, you and I both are like, you know what I'd love to do is just hang out and talk to
5649960	5652960	people about how they should fucking think.
5652960	5655960	Oh, can I change my...
5655960	5658960	Can I be a talk show host?
5658960	5659960	That could be good.
5659960	5661960	This is a fantasy tribe.
5661960	5662960	Yeah.
5662960	5667960	I mean, we're not, like, we're not vetting it through what's going to make the tribe survive.
5667960	5670960	I'm actually curious about the data we'd get.
5670960	5671960	The monkeys can be the audience.
5671960	5676960	If we really asked 200 people, would we get, like, a certain percentage of people that
5676960	5677960	would be like, you know what?
5677960	5681960	Honestly, I swear to God, if you took money off the table, I took everything off the table
5681960	5684960	and you really told me that nothing was ever going to change.
5684960	5690960	So, I wasn't going to find out when I was 55 years old that no system was going to tell
5690960	5691960	me.
5691960	5692960	You did what?
5692960	5696480	You believed in hairstyling for 30 years?
5696480	5698240	You're a dumb piece of shit.
5698240	5701680	You were supposed to put that hairstyling money into a Roth IRA.
5701680	5703280	You're fucking stupid.
5703280	5706160	Your kids got AIDS and you can't cure it now.
5706160	5707720	You're a fucking piece of shit.
5707720	5708720	You have poverty.
5708720	5709720	You should die.
5709720	5713600	Like, that's what we're all reacting to all the time.
5713600	5717960	What's the thing if you took all that shit off the table, that fear, that fear of, like,
5717960	5722520	oh, fuck, I don't want to find out I did it wrong?
5722520	5727920	What would you do as a sim all day?
5727920	5733520	The theory is, primatologically, that there would be enough people that would be like,
5733520	5737440	I think I just want to cut everyone's hair, that there would be just enough of those people.
5737440	5740320	There wouldn't be 40 of those people per 200 people.
5740320	5741320	What would you do?
5741320	5743960	The most simple thing that we're making out of it?
5743960	5744960	Me?
5744960	5745960	Yeah.
5746960	5747960	I swear to God.
5747960	5752480	I'm saying what Caleb's saying, like, I would, but not like, I mean, I swear, I think I would
5752480	5756160	be, let me think about it for a second, can you guys do something else while I really
5756160	5757160	think about it?
5757160	5762280	Well, I think that, for instance, there are people that, like, in anarchist, like, anarcho-sympicalist
5762280	5768040	societies that they go, oh, I don't have to sweep floors all day long for no money.
5768040	5769760	I can now do what I want.
5769760	5771360	And there are people that go, you know what I want to do?
5771360	5772960	I want to plant trees.
5772960	5774520	And I want to make the street pretty.
5774520	5778400	And I want to make, like, I want to just go out and plant trees.
5778400	5783480	And that was like, and people go, that's my life's ambition, is to beautify something.
5783480	5786040	Or people go, you know what?
5786040	5787040	Tree playing.
5787040	5790080	There's exactly the same amount of, oh, it's those assholes I got.
5790080	5791440	Yeah, of course.
5791440	5792440	You tricked us!
5792440	5794920	You tricked us into believing in a dream!
5794920	5797920	I swear it was real!
5797920	5800040	So we softened you!
5800040	5803520	But there are people that, there are also people that work in a factory all day long,
5803520	5810640	and they go, if I had time, like, between my commute and doing my day job and needing
5810640	5816320	to eat food and feed my children and do all this stuff, I would love to make model airplanes
5816320	5818600	because at heart, I'm an engineer.
5818600	5820240	I would love to make things.
5820240	5826640	And if people had free time to actually do something that made them joyful and gave them
5826640	5833040	glee, like, for me, like, I think it'd be as simple as gardening.
5833040	5836280	Like, I would like to grow things because it's a very satisfying...
5836280	5840360	The idea that people, yeah, you saying that, first of all, I believe it.
5840360	5845200	And second of all, it blows my fucking mind so much that I'm like, the dream is real.
5845200	5850640	Because if there's a person that actually wants to garden, that I'm like, that, that,
5850640	5853880	because I'm like, I don't want nothing to do with that.
5854880	5860480	Well, except for you to say, like, if you're being remotely honest about it, that you're
5860480	5861480	like, I want to get down...
5861480	5862480	No, I'm being fully honest about it.
5862480	5865960	I hear people express that all the time, like, I want my hands in the dirt and I love nurturing
5865960	5868680	the stuff, and I see that passion, otherwise we wouldn't have shit that grows.
5868680	5872560	It was like, it was obviously reliant on people that feel that way.
5872560	5877800	And so, and then that does cast people like me in a little bit, and I think, Caleb, you
5877800	5880040	know, a little bit of a fraud complex, right?
5880040	5881040	Because what are we doing?
5881040	5882040	We're going like...
5882040	5883040	I'm a frog.
5883040	5884040	I'm a frog.
5884040	5885040	I'm a frog.
5885040	5887040	I'm a frog.
5887040	5891840	Does it count as an answer if what you want to do is hang out and let people know they're
5891840	5896200	doing a good job?
5896200	5899600	You want to say, you want to be like, no, that makes me a bad person, but it means maybe
5899600	5901680	we haven't found, like, whatever...
5901680	5903760	Why is that a frog complex?
5903760	5907360	Frog, you fucking dick.
5907360	5908360	You said frog.
5908360	5909360	You said frog.
5909360	5910360	I sounded like frog.
5910360	5912360	I don't care what I said.
5913160	5915280	English is contextual.
5915280	5918360	No one has ever had a frog complex.
5922360	5925920	Actually, actually, that sounds kind of, I mean, a frog complex, given our history and
5925920	5930200	mythology of, like, frogs turning into princes, that's like, I'm an ugly frog.
5930200	5931200	That would make sense.
5931200	5932200	Yelled at me.
5932200	5936080	All right, well, I yelled at you because I'm a frog.
5936080	5937080	He's got a frog complex.
5937080	5938080	I'm talking to Caleb.
5938080	5941360	Dan, do you know what a horny toad says?
5942360	5943360	Rub it.
5944360	5945360	What?
5945360	5946360	What does he say?
5946360	5947360	What?
5947360	5948360	Rub it.
5948360	5949360	Rub it.
5949360	5950360	Rub it.
5950360	5951360	Rub it.
5951360	5952360	Rub it.
5952360	5953360	That's what I want to say.
5953360	5954360	Yeah.
5962360	5965360	Jeff is bowing her team.
5965360	5968360	That's them saying they wish the show was over.
5968360	5970360	That's all they're saying.
5971360	5974360	They're saying that would have made a good closer.
5974360	5976360	I don't, yeah.
5976360	5979360	I'm just going to say that would have been a bad closing.
5979360	5982360	I was certain that I was not going to follow up any questions.
5982360	5985360	I thought you said frog complex, too.
5985360	5990360	But I kind of wonder, I really always wonder that, but I'm listening to that Sapiens book
5990360	5991360	and that stuff.
5991360	5998360	I just wonder about that, like, you scoop 100 people up with a net and you dump them
5998360	6001360	into an aquarium as much as you can.
6001360	6002360	Probably drown.
6002360	6005360	If it...
6005360	6008360	The aquarium's not...
6008360	6010360	Not only is it not filled with water, Caleb.
6010360	6011360	It's bad, yeah.
6011360	6014360	He was off-wank and he said they'd probably drown.
6014360	6017360	It's not filled with water and it's not a real aquarium.
6017360	6020360	But that idea of like...
6020360	6022360	I think that's like...
6022360	6026360	I want to get to the bottom as an idealistic dream.
6026360	6034360	Like, I feel like I've spent 30 years belonging to an ideology that, even though it doesn't
6034360	6040360	get questioned a lot, that underneath everything, what I really believe, is that if you took
6040360	6049360	100 people and scooped them up randomly and plopped them onto a pile of desert that they
6049360	6054360	had to fend for themselves, that they would have problems and there would be crime and
6054360	6056360	there would be horrible things happening.
6056360	6057360	There would be hatred.
6057360	6058360	There would be all these things.
6058360	6064360	But that, overall, there would be this order that evolved that was actually somehow kind
6064360	6067360	of a little...
6067360	6072360	The one thing you could say about that society if you came back to visit it in 10 years would
6072360	6077360	be, there's a lot less knots in the psychology.
6077360	6080360	There's a lot less of these, like, things.
6080360	6085360	There's like 30% of the people aren't having rape fantasies that they...
6085360	6089360	It wouldn't be as fucking knotted up.
6089360	6094360	It would be more natural.
6094360	6099360	People would just be like, here's what I like to do.
6099360	6103360	I talked to Cindy about it and she said it's fine.
6103360	6107360	And everyone would be like, I'm frustrated because Mark doesn't do enough of this.
6107360	6110360	It would just be a little less knotted.
6110360	6113360	You guys don't know what a phone cord is.
6113360	6116360	But that's how I always look at society.
6116360	6118360	They designed society.
6118360	6124360	There was this thing in the 90s called the phone cord.
6124360	6126360	Engineers had this problem.
6126360	6128360	They had to make phones.
6128360	6131360	You had to be able to talk on them wherever you went.
6131360	6134360	But we couldn't have you do that yet.
6134360	6136360	Stick with me.
6136360	6142360	So they needed cords, but they couldn't just make a fucking string that was so long that you could walk everywhere
6142360	6145360	because then the dog would hang itself.
6145360	6148360	You would just step on it and all this shit.
6148360	6152360	So they made this intricately curled cord.
6152360	6154360	It's like a phone cord.
6154360	6161360	If you pull on it, the spiral stretches out and you could play with it when you talk to the phone.
6161360	6165360	But overall, it was just this attempt to turn something that wasn't elastic into something elastic.
6165360	6171360	It was this attempt to take something that needed to be connected and make it as if it wasn't connected.
6171360	6177360	And that's how I feel about society, is that there's too many fucking...
6180360	6183360	That laugh really got to me.
6183360	6188360	It was a natural laugh, and it's important that it got to me.
6188360	6192360	It's true what I'm saying doesn't make a lot of sense.
6192360	6195360	But that's the point of explaining something to people.
6195360	6198360	Dan, you got a real frog complex.
6198360	6201360	I just want to finish my thought.
6201360	6206360	If you can bring this train into the station, I'm going to fucking buy you a...
6206360	6209360	We all know it's not going to make sense when I finish saying it.
6209360	6212360	That's how I look at society, is that it's already fucking coiled.
6212360	6216360	It's already designed to do something that it's not supposed to do.
6216360	6219360	But also, that's noble.
6219360	6221360	The idea that it just goes like that.
6221360	6225360	When you look at a new phone cord, when you buy it at the hardware store,
6225360	6227360	and you hold it in your hands, you're like,
6227360	6231360	this is an actual marvel of engineering. It's kind of beautiful.
6231360	6235360	And you want to touch it and put your finger through the...
6235360	6238360	You kids don't know what a phone cord is.
6238360	6243360	Also, you didn't know that you had to buy them at the hardware store.
6243360	6246360	You did. You did.
6246360	6247360	The hardware store?
6247360	6251360	No, there were phone stores.
6251360	6253360	Yeah, is that...
6253360	6258360	Honestly, at this point, the temptation to take me down is...
6258360	6261360	You're increasing my self-esteem.
6261360	6263360	Increasing it.
6263360	6265360	I'm sorry to inform you.
6265360	6270360	Every breath I take without your permission raises my self-worth.
6270360	6274360	There's a certain point when you force a human being to realize
6274360	6277360	that they can't exist with your approval.
6277360	6279360	It makes me stronger.
6279360	6281360	I'm your worst nightmare.
6281360	6285360	I'm a person that you didn't want to live to see today that did.
6285360	6287360	You drew first blood.
6287360	6289360	Now I know you're powerless.
6289360	6292360	Don't applaud that. That's Hitler stuff.
6292360	6294360	He has a gun.
6294360	6297360	We don't want to do it with the two hammers and the Pink Floyd.
6297360	6299360	What were you going to say?
6299360	6301360	They drew first blood.
6301360	6304360	I just wanted to finish the phone cord.
6304360	6310360	You millennials, the phone cord was notoriously easy to tangle.
6310360	6315360	It was simultaneously a thing that was like, we solved it, we figured it out.
6315360	6319360	This thing needs to connect from one side of your house to another
6319360	6321360	or from the cradle of the phone to the handset,
6321360	6327360	but who wants to deal with it and we want it to be kosher and friendly and nice.
6327360	6331360	The result is this thing that stretches and it's in this amazing feat of engineering,
6331360	6336360	but when that thing tangles, when you use it, when you put it to the test,
6336360	6339360	it is the most fucking knotted ass.
6339360	6341360	It gets so fucking tangled.
6341360	6344360	What I'm saying is when we talk about anarchy,
6344360	6348360	we're talking about just saying, what if we had a straight cord?
6348360	6354360	The answer is that's not possible because we need this fucking thing
6354360	6356360	to reach across the house.
6356360	6359360	You can't talk about anarchy anywhere because you're talking about 100 people,
6359360	6361360	but it still is worth keeping in your head.
6361360	6366360	You know, if this fucking thing was straight, Jesus Christ, we're talking about a phone do it.
6366360	6367360	All right, I'm done.
6367360	6372360	Well, wait, okay, so just last little cap.
6372360	6376360	It's not like I actually think we should all go live in a cave and hunt bison.
6376360	6377360	I don't really believe that.
6377360	6382360	Well, what if our communities, the communities we actually lived and worked in,
6382360	6386360	were so functional that we were less reliant on all these greater networks
6386360	6388360	for support that we do?
6388360	6391360	What if they started with the precept that if any society,
6391360	6395360	if there's any single human being that's suffering, that the society is failing?
6395360	6402360	That it's like that's a light bulb that's out from the perspective of a light bulb society.
6402360	6404360	It doesn't need to be changed.
6404360	6406360	It doesn't need to be disregarded.
6406360	6408360	We need to deal with this.
6408360	6414360	That we can draw, even if you're crazy, even if you're perverted, even if you're indigent,
6414360	6419360	even if you're like whatever challenge you're posing to our progress,
6419360	6423360	that actually is the whole point of this, is that you're on the ground
6423360	6426360	and you can't hold yourself up and you don't know what's going on
6426360	6429360	or you're angry about something and we say to you, like,
6429360	6432360	then, okay, you know, like, we got to figure this out.
6432360	6434360	Like, what if everything was based on that?
6434360	6437360	Like, that was the core that went outward.
6437360	6442360	It's impossible is the answer because our societies are obviously based on tribes
6442360	6446360	that speared people better.
6446360	6448360	There's no argument to be made.
6448360	6453360	It's not like a TED talk or like, I thought, what if we could feel for a living?
6453360	6455360	Yeah, that'd be great.
6455360	6457360	I know. I know we can't.
6457360	6459360	I know we just had to spear each other.
6459360	6466360	I'm talking into a microphone made out of the blood of weaker, better people.
6466360	6471360	Like, this microphone is made out of people that are better than me
6471360	6476360	that died because they gave someone the benefit of the doubt.
6476360	6477360	That's true.
6477360	6480360	And someone was like, hey, come here for a second.
6480360	6484360	Hey, love you. Hey, come over here.
6484360	6485360	Sounds like he loves me.
6485360	6486360	Honey, I don't think we should.
6486360	6488360	No, I'm just going to.
6488360	6492360	We really want to live in a world where we can't respond to someone saying
6492360	6495360	what he's saying in this Mad Max wasteland.
6495360	6496360	Don't we all need to...
6496360	6498360	Isn't this the beginning of making things better?
6498360	6499360	You're right. I'm sorry.
6499360	6500360	I don't mean to...
6500360	6504360	Yeah, don't fucking talk back to me ever again.
6504360	6506360	Okay, well, I think you're gaslighting me.
6506360	6507360	Fuck you.
6507360	6508360	There's no such thing as that.
6508360	6512360	You made that up because you're fucking crazy.
6512360	6513360	There's no such thing as gaslighting.
6513360	6516360	You fucking made it up because you're fucking crazy.
6516360	6517360	And I love you.
6517360	6520360	And I'm just going to go talk to this guy.
6520360	6523360	I just want to trade you some petrol for some lizard skin.
6524360	6529360	You should have never trusted another fucking human, you piece of shit.
6529360	6534360	I'm going to be the one that writes the history books, you fucking piece of shit.
6534360	6537360	What the fuck is happening? What's going on?
6537360	6538360	Well, let me finish the story.
6538360	6541360	What is happening right now?
6541360	6544360	Native Americans invented gaslighting.
6544360	6546360	I thought it was clear. I thought it was clear.
6546360	6549360	You've lost your mind.
6549360	6552360	You've gone crazy in front of our very eyes.
6552360	6556360	Well, I'll take your word for that, but I have an Emmy.
6556360	6558360	I don't think I can be.
6561360	6564360	I'm maybe I'm testing the limits.
6564360	6566360	I think you've proven that.
6566360	6568360	Yeah, I love it.
6568360	6570360	Come on. How unclear was that? Really?
6570360	6572360	You were following that.
6572360	6574360	That's a simple wasteland play.
6574360	6575360	There was a couple over here.
6575360	6577360	Nobody was following that.
6577360	6579360	How many of you followed that?
6579360	6581360	Look at all those hands.
6581360	6586360	Wait, let's. We should have someone interpret it without help.
6586360	6587360	I don't know. I got it.
6587360	6590360	No, actually, I'm glad it wasn't all of your hands.
6590360	6593360	Come up here and explain what Dan was talking about, please.
6593360	6595360	Let's bring him over.
6596360	6599360	Caleb just volunteered his microphone for Nova.
6599360	6601360	Let's give a hand for Caleb.
6606360	6609360	Caleb will live on in nobility.
6610360	6614360	He gave you his mic.
6614360	6617360	Nova, can you take Rob's mic?
6622360	6623360	It's actually my birthday tomorrow.
6623360	6624360	Thank you.
6624360	6625360	It's your birthday tomorrow.
6625360	6627360	It's Nova's birthday.
6627360	6628360	It's your birthday?
6628360	6629360	Yeah, tomorrow.
6629360	6630360	Well, happy birthday almost.
6630360	6632360	Thank you.
6632360	6636360	All right, so yeah, so encapsulate what Dan was breaking down for us.
6637360	6639360	It's like telephone.
6639360	6642360	Yeah, I don't know how much better I am at explaining things than Dan,
6642360	6644360	but I got what he was saying.
6644360	6647360	I feel like when you're on my side, though, I do better.
6647360	6648360	Huh?
6648360	6651360	I feel like you're a more charismatic person,
6651360	6653360	so it just doesn't matter if you understood me or not.
6653360	6657360	Just say you do, and then people will respect me.
6657360	6659360	That's all. That's my stake in it.
6659360	6661360	Or I just look like a rabid Harmon fan.
6661360	6662360	Steve, give Rob your mic.
6662360	6663360	He's just kissing at the feet of Harmon.
6663360	6664360	I'm like, no, fuck you.
6664360	6665360	Anyway.
6667360	6668360	Yeah, well...
6671360	6672360	So who was the first guy?
6672360	6675360	Who was the first guy that was saying, we love you?
6675360	6679360	That was saying, okay, at the beginning of the wasteland sketch
6679360	6680360	with the couple...
6680360	6681360	Yeah, there was the guy saying, we love you.
6681360	6682360	Come over here.
6682360	6683360	Who was that?
6684360	6687360	No, this is the whole exercise that is this person.
6687360	6688360	You guys are the worst.
6688360	6689360	I'm kidding.
6689360	6690360	I'm sorry.
6690360	6693360	Okay, yeah, there was a couple in a cave or whatever,
6693360	6697360	and then some dude is trying to come over to be like, hey, here he goes.
6697360	6698360	A cave dude?
6698360	6702360	Yeah, yeah, another cave dude in a different cave or whatever
6702360	6705360	from a different tribe or something in some kind of wasteland or cave method.
6705360	6706360	An outlander, yeah.
6706360	6708360	He's coming to the couple's house, and the wife's just like,
6708360	6710360	oh, I don't know if you should trust him.
6710360	6711360	He could be trying to fool us.
6711360	6716360	And then the guys are like, no, what kind of world...
6716360	6719360	What kind of world where we can't trust people?
6719360	6722360	He's like, maybe if I reach out my hand, maybe he'll be like,
6722360	6724360	oh, I'm not going to kill this guy or something,
6724360	6727360	or maybe we don't want to assume that this is a bad guy.
6727360	6728360	And then what happened?
6728360	6731360	And also there was a little aside there, which got a lot of applause.
6731360	6732360	Yeah, I liked it a lot.
6732360	6734360	Where I did a little social commentary.
6734360	6738360	I liked it a lot because it's a good commentary on guys being like,
6738360	6740360	look, we've got to be cordial to each other.
6740360	6741360	Hey, fuck you, wife.
6741360	6743360	And you know where I got that?
6743360	6744360	You know where I researched that?
6744360	6745360	My fucking...
6745360	6747360	Looking into my fucking self.
6747360	6751360	Which is why people like you are a fan of me because no matter what I do,
6751360	6753360	at least a goddamn I'm going to take inventory.
6753360	6756360	Unlike all of my friends in air quotes.
6756360	6757360	I'm doing great.
6757360	6758360	I'm doing great.
6758360	6760360	Please continue.
6762360	6765360	Yeah, that was like a little commentary on how we're like,
6765360	6766360	hey, you know what?
6766360	6768360	Man's got to be nice to man.
6768360	6769360	But then it's just like...
6769360	6771360	But I'm abusing women.
6771360	6772360	I'm like a misogynist.
6772360	6773360	That was me.
6773360	6774360	That character was me.
6774360	6775360	I'm willing to say it now.
6776360	6778360	It's like, oh, there's a guy over there.
6778360	6781360	He's got a gas canister and he's like, oh, over here.
6781360	6783360	And I'm like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
6783360	6786360	be to the poor fucking partner that trusted me enough.
6786360	6789360	It's like, oh, you sound like you know what you're doing.
6789360	6791360	That's the first person I would abuse.
6791360	6794360	And then this person over there, I'd be like, whoa, hello.
6794360	6795360	And awful.
6795360	6796360	I'd be like, look, I'm the man.
6796360	6797360	I'm going to make the decision.
6797360	6798360	You know what?
6798360	6800360	I'm going to decide for both of us.
6800360	6801360	Because otherwise I'm not...
6801360	6803360	I'm going to be ashamed of myself if I don't...
6803360	6807360	That I'm going to reach out a hand to this other human being.
6807360	6809360	Whereas maybe if both of them collaborated and we're like,
6809360	6811360	that guy looks like he's going to...
6811360	6812360	Or who knows?
6812360	6813360	Let's be safe.
6813360	6814360	Oh, yeah.
6814360	6815360	Like if the couple teamed up really,
6815360	6817360	then maybe things would be OK or something.
6817360	6818360	Right.
6818360	6820360	So then he chooses to trust this person.
6820360	6821360	Yeah.
6821360	6822360	And then what happens?
6822360	6823360	He chooses to trust the guy he chooses
6823360	6825360	to let him into his house.
6825360	6827360	And then you saw what happened, right?
6827360	6829360	I don't know if I'm doing better than Dan did.
6829360	6832360	No, you're doing great.
6832360	6833360	Yeah.
6833360	6834360	And then the...
6834360	6835360	Yeah.
6835360	6837360	The guy comes into the house and the guy's just like,
6837360	6838360	I'm going to fucking...
6838360	6839360	I'm going to kill this guy and his wife
6839360	6841360	and I'm going to take their shit.
6841360	6842360	Yeah.
6842360	6843360	It's simple Fallout 4.
6843360	6844360	Because he's like, look, you know...
6844360	6845360	Yeah.
6845360	6846360	He's like the guy who's just like,
6846360	6848360	look, trust no one or whatever.
6848360	6849360	Yeah.
6849360	6850360	Everybody gets the joke.
6850360	6851360	Huh?
6851360	6852360	Yeah.
6852360	6853360	We just proved it.
6853360	6854360	Yeah.
6854360	6855360	That was the whole point of...
6855360	6856360	I don't know if you guys realize this,
6856360	6859360	but my whole point here in this whole exercise
6859360	6864360	was to validate that Dan successfully explained himself.
6864360	6865360	Yeah.
6865360	6866360	Stop gaslighting Dan.
6866360	6867360	And here we have proof that that has happened.
6867360	6870360	And sometimes we have a lot of fun...
6870360	6873360	This idea we circle that I don't know what I'm talking about
6873360	6877360	and I don't make any sense while mostly accurate
6877360	6880360	is also it's part of a chain of behavior.
6880360	6881360	He isn't even listening.
6881360	6882360	He's the only one I want listening.
6882360	6883360	I'm listening.
6883360	6884360	All right.
6884360	6885360	You're not listening.
6885360	6886360	A chain of behavior?
6886360	6887360	Nah.
6887360	6888360	You can't just say two words.
6889360	6890360	That's exactly...
6890360	6892360	That's the good trick.
6892360	6893360	No, no.
6893360	6895360	I wasn't saying that you weren't making a point.
6895360	6896360	I just...
6896360	6898360	I wanted you to like expound on it.
6898360	6899360	I didn't quite catch it.
6899360	6900360	I thought...
6900360	6901360	I don't think that's how he expressed it.
6901360	6902360	I think he was like,
6902360	6905360	Dan, you need to be in an asylum.
6905360	6906360	Yeah.
6906360	6907360	Didn't you...
6907360	6908360	He was like,
6908360	6910360	you're fucking nuts right now
6910360	6913360	and you need to reevaluate how your brain works
6913360	6915360	because no one knows what you're talking about
6915360	6916360	and you're fucking crazy.
6916360	6917360	Okay.
6917360	6918360	So, yeah.
6918360	6919360	You got that right.
6919360	6920360	I thought it was...
6920360	6921360	Yeah.
6921360	6924360	I thought it was Native Americans and conquistadors.
6924360	6926360	So, you were kind of farther back.
6926360	6927360	The truth is,
6927360	6928360	I'm not that much of a history buff.
6928360	6931360	I've just been playing Fallout 4 for...
6931360	6932360	Yeah.
6932360	6933360	I think about that a lot.
6933360	6934360	Like Desert Wasteland.
6934360	6935360	What if we were all dropped on to something?
6935360	6936360	What would happen?
6936360	6937360	I think about that all the time.
6937360	6938360	Are you a gamer?
6938360	6940360	Do you play RPG video games?
6943360	6945360	Just start heating up for me.
6946360	6947360	You're not...
6947360	6948360	It's okay if you're not.
6948360	6949360	You don't have to...
6949360	6950360	Clearly you're not,
6950360	6951360	or you would have been like,
6951360	6952360	yeah, yeah, yeah.
6952360	6953360	No, I am.
6953360	6954360	I just...
6954360	6955360	I remember last time we talked about,
6955360	6956360	like, Sims or whatever,
6956360	6957360	but there's other games that I like.
6957360	6958360	Like Stardew Valley.
6958360	6959360	Oh, yeah.
6959360	6960360	Oh.
6960360	6961360	Oh, that's the expression on your face.
6961360	6962360	It was like,
6962360	6963360	oh, he's an alcoholic.
6963360	6964360	He doesn't remember our last conversation.
6964360	6965360	I got...
6966360	6967360	I thought it was like,
6967360	6968360	no, I'm into football.
6968360	6970360	No, you're a drunk dad.
6970360	6971360	Yeah, last episode,
6971360	6972360	you were like,
6972360	6973360	what happened last week?
6973360	6974360	Last week was the special, right?
6975360	6976360	Every one of our...
6976360	6977360	We could bond.
6977360	6978360	This is our relationship.
6978360	6979360	It's my memory.
6979360	6980360	It's like,
6980360	6982360	yeah, I want to make this sled.
6982360	6984360	It's going to be a great sled.
6984360	6986360	It could be like me remembering things.
6987360	6989360	Dan, maybe a bad pitch.
6989360	6991360	We have like a couple minutes left.
6991360	6995360	What if we do a very brief D&D thing
6995360	6996360	where it's you and Nova,
6996360	6998360	and you guys are on like a little side quest.
6998360	6999360	All right, I'm on board.
6999360	7000360	Ooh, awesome.
7000360	7002360	Did you say you're on board?
7002360	7004360	Find yourself on a little raft.
7010360	7011360	You're on a little raft.
7011360	7013360	You've been sailing for days
7013360	7016360	for the shores of mines
7017360	7019360	to find the mines of shores.
7023360	7024360	You're on a raft?
7024360	7025360	You're on a raft.
7025360	7026360	Is my character...
7027360	7029360	Let's establish that now.
7030360	7032360	I am Guh-Fulk,
7033360	7036360	a healer of folk.
7038360	7039360	I'm Tammy,
7039360	7041360	Flirber of Derbs.
7042360	7043360	Flirber of Derbs?
7043360	7045360	Yeah, Flirber of Derbs.
7046360	7047360	Sorry, I'm just...
7047360	7050360	The sun, it's making my brain heal.
7050360	7051360	It's a little hot.
7051360	7053360	We should probably get some water,
7053360	7054360	or maybe not.
7054360	7056360	I'm sorry I talked you into this adventure.
7057360	7059360	It's probably not what you expected.
7059360	7060360	No, you know what?
7060360	7062360	I kind of seemed like, you know,
7062360	7063360	I was letting you talk me into it,
7063360	7065360	but really, I was on board the whole time.
7065360	7066360	I just, you know.
7066360	7069360	But yeah, okay, so we're on this raft.
7069360	7070360	We've got to make it to shore, right?
7070360	7072360	Oh, you make it to shore.
7072360	7073360	We make it to shore.
7073360	7074360	Okay, fine.
7074360	7075360	I take my apology back.
7075360	7076360	I've nailed it.
7077360	7078360	We're partners in this adventure.
7078360	7079360	You don't get to just be like,
7079360	7081360	hey, I'm the one leading this.
7081360	7082360	Giant crab!
7083360	7084360	Oh, shit.
7084360	7086360	I don't want to get eaten alive.
7086360	7087360	It's bigger than that.
7087360	7089360	I think that by definition,
7089360	7091360	the giantness means you can't stomp.
7091360	7093360	Well, I was thinking of a real giant crab.
7093360	7095360	You're thinking of a regular crab, yeah.
7095360	7096360	A stompable crab, they call them.
7096360	7098360	I was thinking of a real giant crab,
7098360	7099360	which is only kind of big.
7099360	7100360	Oh, yeah, I know.
7100360	7102360	You have real giant crabs like at Albertsons,
7102360	7104360	or you could still stomp them.
7104360	7105360	Do I have any weapons?
7105360	7107360	There's actually a whole stompable crab section,
7107360	7108360	and I don't know why,
7108360	7110360	since there's no knobs in there.
7110360	7111360	Do I have any weapons?
7111360	7113360	There's actually a whole stompable crab section,
7113360	7114360	and I don't know why,
7114360	7115360	since there's no non-stompable crabs,
7115360	7117360	but then it's like small, medium, large.
7117360	7119360	We have oars for a raft or whatever?
7119360	7120360	Yeah, let's take the oars.
7120360	7122360	Okay, I start stabbing at it with an oar.
7122360	7125360	Is it actively trying to attack us?
7125360	7126360	Oh, actively.
7126360	7127360	Okay, yeah.
7127360	7128360	Will you help me out?
7128360	7129360	Yes.
7129360	7130360	What's your name?
7132360	7134360	I know your name is...
7135360	7136360	We were in a raft forever.
7136360	7139360	This is not the time to high road me.
7140360	7141360	What's your preferred pronoun?
7141360	7143360	Kill the crab!
7144360	7145360	Don't worry about it.
7145360	7147360	We'll figure it out later.
7147360	7148360	Yeah, okay.
7148360	7149360	It doesn't matter.
7149360	7151360	You guys want me to come back?
7151360	7153360	Wait, you attacked us.
7153360	7155360	I didn't say anything about my preferred pronoun.
7155360	7156360	I didn't say anything about that.
7156360	7157360	No, I know you didn't.
7157360	7158360	You didn't.
7158360	7159360	No, wait, wait, wait.
7159360	7161360	Actually, I need to ask you this.
7161360	7163360	Did the crab actually ever attack us?
7163360	7165360	It just said giant crab.
7165360	7166360	It seemed like it was attacking.
7166360	7167360	It may not have said...
7167360	7168360	And then I started to...
7168360	7169360	It seemed like it was attacking.
7169360	7170360	Did the crab actively attacking?
7170360	7171360	Right.
7171360	7173360	I asked him if it was actively attacking, and he said it was.
7173360	7174360	Sorry.
7174360	7175360	Sorry.
7175360	7176360	Stop.
7176360	7178360	You need to help me attack you.
7178360	7180360	It's attacking us actively.
7180360	7182360	I thought the crab said, I'm going to come back later.
7182360	7184360	See, that's what I'm saying.
7184360	7185360	When a crab says that, you...
7185360	7186360	I'm going to come back.
7186360	7188360	Okay, so next time we can just start a little domestic fighting,
7188360	7190360	and then whatever it is, we'll leave us alone,
7190360	7192360	because it'll be too awkward for them, and they'll just leave.
7192360	7193360	The crab, yeah.
7193360	7194360	I don't know how the...
7194360	7195360	Bye, crab.
7195360	7196360	Sorry.
7197360	7198360	Sorry.
7199360	7202360	We didn't know that you could talk.
7202360	7205360	The first thing I did was giant crab.
7208360	7210360	Why did you say that?
7210360	7211360	Fair enough, fair enough.
7211360	7212360	I'm going for real now.
7212360	7213360	Fair enough.
7213360	7214360	I'm sorry.
7214360	7215360	We're sorry.
7215360	7216360	We fucked up.
7216360	7217360	Can we both say we fucked up?
7217360	7218360	Okay, I'll say I fucked up.
7218360	7223360	If there's one thing I've learned, we need to be a team.
7223360	7225360	Otherwise, I'm not gaslighting you.
7225360	7226360	Okay.
7226360	7227360	All right.
7227360	7228360	You're not gaslighting me.
7228360	7229360	He's sideways walking.
7229360	7230360	I don't know what that means.
7230360	7231360	I don't know if that's like a...
7231360	7232360	That's why he's leaving.
7232360	7233360	Hey.
7233360	7234360	Okay, we fucked up.
7234360	7235360	Marsha?
7235360	7236360	We fucked up.
7236360	7237360	Marsha.
7237360	7238360	I attacked him with not enough information,
7238360	7239360	and you didn't back me up when I made a decision.
7239360	7240360	Marsha?
7240360	7241360	We both fucked up.
7241360	7244360	As your husband, giant crab, what are you doing?
7244360	7247360	You were supposed to be home a half hour ago.
7247360	7248360	Well, I was on my way home.
7248360	7249360	We better get out of here.
7249360	7250360	This is awkward.
7250360	7251360	I think he's elsewhere.
7251360	7254360	I think if we stay, it's going to be better than if we...
7255360	7258360	Who are your new friends, Marsha?
7258360	7260360	You got these friends over here?
7260360	7262360	Well, they were kicking me.
7262360	7263360	I'm sorry.
7263360	7264360	I apologize.
7264360	7265360	Hi.
7265360	7266360	This one was stepping on my foot a lot,
7266360	7267360	thinking it was doing something.
7267360	7268360	I'm sorry.
7268360	7269360	Well, why don't we attack them?
7269360	7270360	You came at me.
7270360	7271360	I'm sorry.
7271360	7272360	I attack.
7272360	7273360	I attack.
7273360	7274360	You got to yell where you are before you...
7274360	7275360	I attack.
7275360	7276360	Okay.
7276360	7277360	Well, we should have left.
7277360	7278360	I'm a protective crab.
7278360	7283360	I attack Dan or whatever his name is over there.
7283360	7284360	Okay.
7284360	7285360	I'm sorry about that.
7285360	7286360	We should have left.
7286360	7287360	All right.
7287360	7288360	I'm sorry.
7288360	7289360	Giant crabs.
7289360	7290360	Claw attack.
7290360	7291360	Okay.
7291360	7292360	Okay.
7292360	7293360	Oars, right?
7293360	7294360	We're going to do it now?
7294360	7296360	If someone attacks me, hit them with an oar.
7296360	7297360	You know what?
7297360	7299360	Even if they don't, partners.
7299360	7300360	Partners?
7300360	7302360	Fucking oar attack.
7302360	7303360	No matter what.
7303360	7304360	I don't even care if it makes me evil.
7304360	7306360	Let's fucking go down killing people with oars.
7306360	7307360	Let's do it.
7307360	7308360	We just got to be a team.
7308360	7312360	I'm a crab rogue, so I use claw sneak attack.
7312360	7317360	I think I have a plus 2d6 on that.
7317360	7318360	I've been with the oars.
7318360	7319360	Is it not doing anything?
7319360	7320360	I've been doing it.
7320360	7321360	I don't know.
7321360	7322360	There's no real rules right now.
7322360	7325360	It's a free for all.
7325360	7327360	We don't have to take turns.
7327360	7328360	Yeah, no.
7328360	7331360	Just roll the dice on my crab attack.
7331360	7332360	Oh, yeah.
7332360	7333360	No, you get a six.
7333360	7336360	Do you have your dice?
7336360	7337360	Why do you have a five hour energy?
7338360	7343360	This is how a parlor game started before Louis Pasteur and Marie Curie.
7343360	7346360	Like, look, we need some fucking dice or something.
7346360	7349360	It was just rich people in a parlor going like, well, I do this.
7349360	7350360	Will I do that?
7350360	7351360	Fuck you.
7351360	7355360	And then someone was like, look, get me a pen and paper.
7355360	7356360	They weren't yes-anding.
7356360	7357360	And they're being like, you can't just do that.
7357360	7360360	You can't just say that I didn't do that because I did.
7360360	7361360	Let's roll for it.
7361360	7364360	So do I deal six crab damage on damage?
7364360	7365360	They weren't improv trained.
7365360	7366360	Yeah.
7366360	7367360	Yeah.
7367360	7368360	You deal six crab damage.
7368360	7369360	On who?
7369360	7370360	On me?
7370360	7372360	Spencer checked out a long time ago.
7372360	7375360	I'm the only person who understands what's happening.
7375360	7377360	These are the rules of the game.
7377360	7383360	Spencer, Junova, and I have a combined as long as we work together perk that raises our hit
7383360	7384360	points by 600%.
7384360	7385360	Morale boost?

7457160	7458160	You're a piece of shit.

7461800	7469920	going to leave here through the chimney because of you because I don't want to interact.
7469920	7472160	You're going to make me uncomfortable.
7472160	7473720	I can't understand you.
7473720	7475400	Well, it's just, you're feeding into it.

7488280	7489280	You should, like drunk.
7489280	7490280	I'm drunk.
7490280	7491280	I don't do this.
7491280	7492280	That's true.
7492280	7493280	All right.
7493280	7494280	Go well.

7507400	7508400	Tammy?
7508400	7509400	Tammy.
7509400	7511640	We were in a raft and we washed up and we fucked up.
7511640	7520640	We made a lot of mistakes and we feel terrible about them and we want to become a part of
7520640	7523480	this island moving forward.
7523480	7524480	Yeah, is there a society?
7524480	7525480	Can you help us?
7525480	7527920	We want to take our cues from you guys.
7527920	7528920	What's in it for us?
7528920	7529920	We've come here.
7529920	7530920	You are already here.
7530920	7531920	You live here.
7531920	7534440	We have sharpened oars with some of your blood on them.
7534440	7537080	I don't know if that's a thing.
7537600	7540920	No, we got some of those rules.
7540920	7541920	Then we have nothing.
7541920	7542920	I know.
7542920	7543920	You have to trust us.
7543920	7546840	I mean, it has to be like a zero-sum game.
7546840	7547840	All right.
7547840	7548840	Okay.
7548840	7550840	How about this?
7550840	7555600	Return the gemstone.
7555600	7561160	I need to speak to my partner for one second.
7561160	7562160	Return it?
7562160	7563160	It's like the only reason we're here.
7563160	7564800	We might as well leave if we're going to give it up.
7564800	7566000	It's the reason we're here?
7566000	7569120	What the fuck have you been withholding from me?
7569120	7570120	You forgot because you were drunk.
7570120	7571520	I thought we were in a shipwreck.
7571520	7572520	Did I cause the shipwreck?
7572520	7573520	No.
7573520	7574520	We were heading towards mines.
7574520	7575520	Remember?
7575520	7576520	He said we were heading towards mines.
7576520	7577520	Oh my god, the mines.
7577520	7578520	We were trying to get your gem.
7578520	7579520	Oh, I'm so sorry.
7579520	7580520	I am...
7580520	7581520	You should never have...
7581520	7582520	No.
7582520	7583520	You shouldn't...
7583520	7584520	Look, if it was a problem, then I would just leave.
7584520	7587720	I wouldn't be putting up with it.
7587720	7588720	You're not codependent, are you?
7588720	7589720	I don't want to...
7589720	7590720	No.
7590720	7591720	Okay.
7591720	7592720	Is everything okay here?
7592720	7594720	Just give us a sec.
7594720	7595720	Okay.
7596440	7597440	I'll leave my house.
7597440	7598440	Well, we didn't...
7598440	7599440	What?
7599440	7600440	I don't know.
7600440	7601440	He said return it.
7601440	7603880	I'll go to your raft.
7603880	7605040	He said return the gem.
7605040	7606040	They're saying it's theirs.
7606040	7611800	I cast detect passive aggression.
7611800	7612800	Everyone keeps looking at me.
7612800	7613800	Look, these crabs are pretty passive aggressive.
7613800	7614800	I don't think we are.
7614800	7615800	He said return the gem.
7615800	7617800	We don't have the gem.
7617800	7619600	Well, it's not with us.
7619600	7621000	If you fuck him, tell me.
7621000	7622000	Oh my god.
7622000	7623000	You know what?
7623000	7624000	I knew you'd forget.
7624200	7625200	You know what?
7625200	7626200	I knew you'd forget is the thing.
7626200	7627200	Oh my god.
7627200	7628200	We have the gem.
7628200	7629200	You know what?
7629200	7634200	Well, we don't have it with us.
7634200	7635200	Even if we're like searching.
7635200	7636200	Yeah, no, we got to get the fuck out of here.
7636200	7637200	We got to get out of here.
7637200	7638200	I know.
7638200	7639200	But the raft is deflating though.
7639200	7640200	We can't.
7640200	7641200	We run.
7641200	7642200	I mean, we run.
7642200	7643200	We don't run.
7643200	7644200	I crab attack the raft.
7644200	7645200	You run.
7645200	7646200	We're running.
7646200	7647200	We're running.
7647200	7648200	I destroyed the raft.
7648200	7649200	We're running.
7649200	7650200	We don't care about the raft.
7650200	7651200	We're running.
7651200	7652200	We're running.
7652200	7653200	We're just running.
7653200	7654200	We're running.
7654200	7655200	We're running up the beach.
7655200	7657600	Oh, you guys get there at the same time.
7657600	7658600	We're running.
7658600	7659600	We're running away from the crabs.
7659600	7660600	Oh, well then he definitely.
7660600	7662600	Our destination is not.
7662600	7663600	Okay.
7663600	7664600	We run into the forest.
7664600	7665600	The raft gets destroyed then.
7665600	7666600	But yeah, we don't.
7666600	7667600	We run blindly into the forest.
7667600	7668600	We got shoes.
7668600	7669600	So it's okay.
7669600	7670600	Yeah.
7670600	7671600	That's great.
7671600	7672600	Yeah.
7672600	7673600	All we have is each other and some oars.
7673600	7676600	But what will happen in the forest?
7676600	7677600	Cliffhanger.
7677600	7682600	Give it up for Nova.
