0	7000	San Francisco, California.
7000	10000	Wow.
10000	13000	It truly is an honor to be on stage here at the Punch Line.
13000	15000	I love this club.
15000	17000	I love this city.
17000	19000	I love all of you already.
19000	21000	I've got some very good news for you.
21000	24000	Harman Tower.
24000	27000	I'm Jeff Davis, but won't you more importantly
27000	30000	welcome the mayor of Harman Tower to the stage,
30000	34000	Mr. Dan Harman.
34000	36000	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
36000	39000	San Francisco, choose the fiscal scene,
39000	41000	free and loved your party.
41000	42000	I'm Jeff Davis,
42000	44000	but won't you more importantly
44000	46000	welcome the mayor of Harman Tower to the stage,
46000	50000	Mr. Dan Harman.
50000	52000	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
52000	55000	Choose the fiscal scene, free and loved your mama so hard,
55000	57000	she thought my name wasn't changed.
57000	59000	She said, is your name Jeff?
59000	61000	I said, no it's not, I fucked your mama so hard,
61000	63000	Cristo started to close,
63000	65000	I gave her a cold with magic,
65000	67000	I'm told I took your mama so cold,
67000	69000	I fucked her, fucked your mama,
69000	71000	I fucked your mama in San Francisco,
71000	73000	I fucked your mama,
73000	75000	when is Cristo?
75000	77000	I fucked your mama till she slipped and slid,
77000	80000	I fucked your mama, that's what I did.
80000	82000	I fucked your mama from the bay to the coast,
82000	84000	I fucked your mama so hard,
84000	87000	she thought her name was Donnie Most.
87000	91000	From happy days.
91000	93000	Generation Gap.
102000	104000	Is it possible, Dan,
104000	106000	is it possible to fuck a mama so hard
106000	109000	that she thinks her name is Donnie Most?
109000	112000	Who is Potsy on happy days?
112000	114000	He played Ralph Mouth,
114000	120000	and you tell me.
120000	123000	Is my mic, okay, because I'm hot up here already
123000	125000	because I've gained 300 pounds on the tour,
125000	127000	which is not a bad thing.
127000	129000	You look fantastic.
129000	131000	Thank you.
131000	134000	I always wear a pinstripe shirt if you gain weight
134000	137000	because people associate stripes with tents
137000	139000	and circus.
139000	141000	Doesn't matter, I don't want to talk about weight.
141000	143000	I'm proud that I'm fat.
143000	146000	I'm like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.
146000	150000	I'm the king of this river.
150000	153000	You savages, you worship me.
153000	155000	You were not fat at the beginning of this tour.
155000	157000	Yes, that's the point of getting fat, Jeff.
157000	160000	You end fatter than you were.
160000	163000	If I was thinner, there would be something dishonest happening.
163000	165000	I would have been on tour and I would have been going,
165000	167000	I'll just have the salad.
167000	170000	Like, I ate the country.
170000	176000	Like Pac-Man.
176000	180000	And y'all are the ghosts.
180000	182000	And you're blue tonight.
182000	185000	And you ain't blinking yet.
185000	188000	Again, Generation Gap.
188000	192000	San Francisco, Jeff, our favorite city in the whole country.
192000	198000	These guys are not really from San Francisco.
198000	201000	These guys, it's not really...
201000	203000	Okay, just checking.
203000	206000	Probably a lot of out-of-towners, though, because it's Sketchfest.
206000	208000	We're at the punchline.
208000	210000	I've always wanted to be on stage here.
210000	211000	This is amazing.
211000	215000	Yeah, we've been performing metaphorically at the set-up our entire lives.
215000	217000	Like...
217000	219000	Oh, right.
219000	220000	I gotcha.
221000	224000	We finally get to figure out what the point is tonight.
224000	226000	I think...
226000	230000	It's more San Francisco this way because you got booed over here for that joke.
230000	232000	Well, yeah, that guy comes here every night.
232000	233000	Fuck him.
233000	235000	What does that say about him?
235000	238000	It's not like Greg Proops is going to be up here.
238000	240000	Greg Proops is not going to show up.
240000	241000	Saturday.
241000	242000	Saturday.
242000	243000	Just yell out Saturday.
243000	244000	I don't care.
244000	246000	That guy's name is Saturday.
246000	248000	He's here with his family.
248000	250000	Saturday.
250000	252000	Saturday, you want a Diet Coke?
252000	254000	Saturday.
254000	256000	Saturday, you want to play with your truck?
256000	257000	Saturday.
257000	259000	Dan, I know that you're not...
259000	260000	You don't like sports.
260000	262000	You don't know much about them.
262000	268000	But I do know that it's time for Sports Corner with Dan Herman.
274000	275000	Wait.
275000	276000	Wait.
276000	277000	I got the wrong one.
277000	278000	Not in my opinion.
278000	279000	All right.
279000	281000	Smooth Sports Corner.
281000	282000	Smooth Sports Corner.
282000	285000	It's a sports bevel.
288000	289000	Hello everybody.
289000	292000	Welcome to Smooth Sports Corner.
293000	297000	Smooth with your pinstripe toast, Dan Herman.
297000	298000	Smooth.
298000	300000	Who says a corner has to be hard?
300000	302000	Who says it has to poke out like a glass shot?
302000	305000	A sports corner can be soft, poking to you softly.
305000	307000	A sports corner gonna...
307000	309000	Fuck you.
310000	311000	But soft.
311000	315000	So Dan, Super Bowl Sunday is coming up.
315000	316000	Who do you like?
316000	317000	Who do you like?
317000	320000	Big day? Big Sunday?
320000	321000	Yeah.
322000	327000	Which of the two teams playing in the Super Bowl do you favor?
327000	334000	I mean, look, we got two Titans coming up to...
334000	337000	Not the Titans, not the team.
337000	338000	No, no, no, no.
338000	340000	I just mean two veritable Giants.
340000	341000	Wait, wait, wait.
341000	343000	The Giants are not in the Super Bowl.
343000	344000	No, no, Jeff.
344000	346000	You're getting hung up on pedantic details.
346000	348000	I'm a bigger sports fan than you.
348000	350000	I'm talking mythically.
350000	353000	I'm saying these two large forces athletically.
353000	354000	Who do you like though, Dan?
354000	356000	Well, I like them both, Jeff.
356000	357000	They're...
357000	360000	It's called the Super Bowl, not the mundane bowl.
360000	362000	I enjoy both of them.
362000	366000	I think they both enjoy to be honored and compete with each other.
366000	375000	We are at a rare 50-yard line on a battlefield, Jeff.
375000	377000	It's not just a football field.
377000	379000	It's a battlefield between two armies.
379000	382000	Which team do you think are in the Super Bowl?
382000	391000	I think, Jeff, that when you look at the conferences
391000	396000	and the way that they've proceeded from wide to narrow,
396000	401000	with each all-star going to a new conference star to a bracket
401000	404000	and then finally to the finalists,
404000	409000	you're looking at two huge, huge talents.
409000	410000	But if I go to Vegas, Dan,
410000	416000	if I go to Vegas and want to lay a bet between two teams in the Super Bowl,
416000	419000	which two teams would I be betting on?
419000	422000	I would put my money...
422000	427000	And I'm going to tell you right now, we're in San Francisco.
427000	435000	Right, but you said the Giants weren't in the Super Bowl.
435000	437000	That's what you said.
437000	439000	The Giants play baseball.
439000	442000	The Giants, that's the World Series.
442000	446000	I was so proud of myself.
446000	448000	The Giants are a great baseball team
448000	451000	who I believe have won the last World Series.
451000	458000	Jeff, let's face it, the 49ers aren't in it either.
458000	460000	Yes, they are.
460000	465000	I mean, they're not in it spiritually.
465000	467000	Are you saying they are in it?
467000	470000	Are you saying I successfully guessed half of the Super Bowl?
470000	471000	Yes.
471000	475000	The 49ers, Jeff, are in the Super Bowl.
475000	478000	I think that much is obvious.
478000	480000	Well, certainly.
480000	483000	And what do you think about their opponents?
483000	487000	Oh, God, could you ask for a greater battle, Jeff?
487000	492000	I mean, years, years, the old, the old, the old...
492000	495000	It's one of the oldest rivalries in sports.
495000	498000	The historic rivalry between these teams.
498000	501000	It's San Francisco and the...
501000	505000	It's just the fact that the 49ers are playing the...
505000	507000	Here are the San Francisco 49ers,
507000	509000	our football team in the Super Bowl,
509000	511000	pick-axing away at victory.
511000	514000	Working so hard, and it's so ironic
514000	518000	that the team they'd go up against would also...
518000	521000	What would you call the team, though?
521000	525000	When you're a 49er and you're like jigging away,
525000	529000	isn't it crazy to think that this thing, this animal,
529000	531000	this bird, this eagle...
531000	533000	No, no, no.
533000	534000	This eagle-like creature...
534000	535000	It's a darker...
535000	536000	This hawk.
536000	537000	It's a blackbird.
537000	538000	This mariner.
538000	539000	It's more of a blackbird.
539000	540000	This pterodactyl.
540000	542000	It's like a crow.
542000	543000	It's closer to a crow.
543000	544000	This raven?
544000	545000	Raven?
545000	548000	This Seattle raven?
548000	550000	This Denver raven?
550000	552000	It's the capital of Maryland.
552000	554000	This Baltimore raven...
554000	556000	There you go.
556000	558000	Traditionally, like in mythology,
558000	562000	the 49er, even in the stories of our youth,
562000	565000	is always waving off ravens with his pick-ax.
565000	567000	Get out of here, you old coot.
567000	571000	I'm trying to dig the opposite of blackness with my pick-ax,
571000	573000	and you're a blackbird, and you're coming down
573000	576000	and trying to get me gold.
576000	579000	It's amazing that these fucking titans giant...
579000	581000	Dan, where do you put the point...
581000	582000	The money line on the...
582000	583000	Here's the deal.
583000	585000	When you put a 49er against a raven,
585000	587000	just as an individual, take one random 49er.
587000	588000	Take Johnson.
588000	591000	Right.
591000	593000	Take the best raven you can.
593000	594000	I don't care.
594000	596000	Take Pickens.
596000	598000	Take Pickens out of the front line,
598000	600000	put them up against Johnson.
600000	603000	Call them the average 49er and the average raven.
603000	604000	What are we looking at?
604000	606000	We're looking at offensive yardage
606000	609000	and defensive knee icing.
609000	611000	So where do they excel?
611000	612000	Well, the 49ers...
612000	615000	As a gambler, where do I put my money?
615000	616000	What's the spread?
616000	617000	Always on the Niners, Jeff,
617000	619000	and I call them the Niners for short.
619000	621000	I don't even bother to say the 49ers
621000	622000	because there's no 60 Niners.
622000	624000	There's no 30 Niners.
624000	625000	I call them the Niners.
625000	627000	I'm a sports fan.
627000	629000	I'm an invederated sports bettor.
629000	632000	Now, do you feel that the Niners' quarterback
632000	633000	is up to snuff,
633000	634000	or do you feel they should bring in
634000	635000	a rookie off the bench?
635000	637000	It's counterintuitive, Jeff.
637000	638000	It won't win me any popularity contests,
638000	640000	but I say lose the quarterback entirely.
640000	642000	Don't use them.
642000	644000	Like, what are we doing out there?
644000	646000	We're throwing a ball and we're catching it
646000	648000	and we're getting tackled every time.
648000	650000	What precedes every tackle
650000	652000	on the raven side of things?
652000	654000	It's a pass.
654000	656000	It's a hike.
656000	658000	It's a touchdown.
658000	660000	It's a scrimmage.
660000	663000	Back it up to the root of the tackle.
663000	666000	Sports Corner with Dan Harmon, everybody.
666000	668000	Get rid of the quarterback
668000	670000	and you've got a safe game.
670000	671000	Sports Corner.
671000	672000	Play it.
672000	673000	Play it.
673000	674000	Scrimmage for scrimmage.
674000	676000	Brought to you by
676000	678000	Tito's Vodka.
678000	679000	Tito's.
679000	682000	The vodka of vodka.
688000	690000	Dan, you were already out on stage before the show.
690000	691000	Yeah, I felt around.
692000	693000	On another show.
693000	695000	And there's a couple out here
695000	697000	that was patched together by Aaron McGathey
697000	699000	in an ungodly manner.
699000	701000	Brian and Lauren, right?
701000	704000	Aaron McGathey hooked up a serial womanizer
704000	706000	with a self-proclaimed slut.
706000	708000	I'm allowed to say that.
708000	710000	You called yourself a slut.
710000	711000	She hooked them up
711000	712000	and they're going to watch Harmon tell me.
712000	714000	Have you guys made out yet?
714000	716000	Can you make out right now?
717000	718000	I don't know. That's not.
718000	720000	Just fucking make out.
720000	722000	This isn't New Orleans.
722000	723000	This is like...
723000	724000	This is San Francisco.
726000	727000	Say what?
728000	729000	Right, right.
729000	730000	Well, do you want to come up?
730000	731000	Just give us a quick report.
731000	732000	Can you come up real quick?
732000	733000	Lauren.
733000	734000	If you want to, it's okay.
734000	735000	Lauren, everybody.
736000	738000	Just because we can't hear.
740000	742000	It's John and Lauren?
742000	743000	Brian.
743000	744000	Brian and Lauren.
744000	745000	Okay.
745000	746000	Close enough when you have a fucking chair.
746000	747000	So I...
748000	749000	Well, I'm a Dan.
749000	750000	I understand.
750000	751000	It's like...
751000	753000	Name yourself Squid or something.
754000	756000	If you want me to remember your name.
756000	761000	If you intend to invent, like, helium or something,
761000	762000	be a Dave.
762000	763000	Go ahead.
763000	765000	But invent helium.
766000	767000	Hey, my name's Ryan.
767000	768000	Hey, Ryan, what do you do?
768000	770000	I'm just standing here.
770000	773000	Well, then I think you might be Steve.
775000	776000	I'm Dan.
777000	778000	I get it.
778000	779000	I get it.
779000	781000	We have a problem with naming in this country.
781000	783000	The people that invented naming human beings
783000	786000	didn't anticipate this population density, Jeff.
788000	789000	The people that invented graveyards,
789000	791000	you can see what we do.
791000	794000	We put a headstone and there's a whole six-foot plot.
794000	797000	Like, we didn't know there would be six billion people.
797000	800000	We've got to change our shit up, man.
800000	802000	How are you guys doing tonight?
802000	803000	Pretty good.
803000	804000	Pretty good.
804000	805000	I got a little drunk before the show.
805000	807000	Good. That's how we like you.
807000	809000	Before the show, you've been drunk for two weeks.
809000	810000	Yeah.
810000	811000	It's all built up.
811000	812000	Okay.
812000	814000	I think I ate a giant cookie.
814000	816000	Martha brought a fan named Martha brought a hot...
816000	817000	Oh, there you are.
817000	819000	She brought a hot cookie.
819000	823000	The camera crew put a camera in her boyfriend's head.
823000	826000	That's what you get for your troubles.
826000	828000	The hot cookie released from my spleen
828000	831000	all of the alcohol for the last two weeks, Jeff.
831000	832000	All right.
832000	834000	So, Brian, Laura, you guys met earlier
834000	836000	during Erin's show, right?
836000	837000	Yeah.
837000	838000	Can you guys see okay?
838000	840000	Didn't think so.
840000	841000	So...
850000	854000	So, Brian, what are the chances
854000	857000	that you and Lauren make out tonight?
857000	859000	I'm going to be...
859000	861000	I want to be modest here.
861000	863000	About 95%.
864000	865000	Nice.
865000	867000	So, it's an almost...
867000	869000	It's a lead pipe cinch.
869000	872000	It's in the bag, you're saying.
872000	874000	I want to say in the bag.
874000	875000	Like I said, 5%.
875000	877000	A lot can happen in that 5%.
877000	878000	Right, but 95%.
878000	880000	Lauren, what do you think?
880000	883000	I would be hesitant to put a number on it
883000	885000	because the truth is that I came here
885000	887000	wanting to make out with Spencer.
887000	889000	That's sort of my...
889000	892000	That's sort of my, like, no offense.
893000	894000	No, yeah.
894000	896000	Spencer to the stage.
901000	905000	You hear your name evoked by a temptress.
907000	909000	Your bag of holding holds your bag,
909000	911000	but will it hold your bagging?
914000	916000	Hello, Spencer.
916000	919000	It's good to be back in California.
923000	926000	That was like the minimal effort required
926000	928000	to get you guys to do that.
929000	930000	Spencer...
930000	931000	You figured it out.
931000	932000	You're a master of the tour.
932000	933000	You know...
933000	935000	I have to take my shirt off in Portland.
937000	938000	Why are you kneeling right now?
938000	940000	Because I feel bad for these people.
940000	941000	They paid 20 bucks.
941000	942000	Fuck them.
942000	943000	Fuck them.
943000	944000	Fuck them.
944000	945000	Hey, fuck these people, Jeff?
945000	947000	Hey, what's your name?
947000	948000	Ryan.
948000	950000	They're human beings, Jeff.
952000	953000	What?
956000	958000	Giraffe rap.
959000	960000	Giraffe rap.
960000	961000	I'm eating a leaf.
961000	963000	Gotta go real high to get up to my treat.
963000	966000	I got a long neck from Charles Darwin.
966000	969000	I want to fuck your mama like it was a hard win.
969000	971000	Put my neck in her pussy.
971000	973000	It's not my neck.
973000	974000	Gary Vesey.
974000	975000	Giraffe rap.
977000	979000	All right.
980000	982000	Did you hear the audience realize...
982000	983000	Oh, he's that dick a bit.
983000	984000	He's really drunk.
987000	988000	They're like, oh, shit.
988000	990000	You have been drunker on this tour.
990000	992000	In this corner...
992000	994000	Alcohol.
994000	997000	Weighing in disproportionately.
999000	1001000	In this corner...
1001000	1004000	Let's get ready to mumble.
1005000	1006000	All right.
1006000	1009000	So, Lauren, you were saying you wanted to make out with Spencer.
1009000	1010000	Yeah, yeah.
1010000	1011000	He's right over there.
1011000	1012000	Fucking make it happen.
1012000	1014000	Get it on.
1014000	1017000	I don't want to rape him.
1018000	1019000	That's good.
1020000	1023000	Sitting across a table,
1023000	1026000	looking with a sack full of dice.
1027000	1030000	Just I feel like a little bully-ish there to have Spencer.
1030000	1032000	Like, well, how does Spencer do that?
1032000	1033000	That's the thing.
1033000	1035000	I don't just want to attack him.
1035000	1037000	It feels like a weird, like...
1037000	1039000	Porky's movie.
1039000	1041000	Do what you make out with her.
1041000	1044000	Wrap your tits on Spencer.
1044000	1045000	Hey, Spencer.
1045000	1049000	You scoring a plus one against those titties.
1050000	1058000	But meanwhile, Brian thought it was 95% certainty that he was
1058000	1060000	going to make out with Lauren.
1061000	1064000	If you had gotten to meet him during Aaron's segment,
1064000	1067000	we know the archetype this guy represents.
1068000	1074000	He was very, very honest about where he feeds in the aquarium.
1076000	1080000	I have a personal problem with this archetype.
1080000	1085000	When I like a chick, I ask her out and I'm in her face.
1085000	1087000	I go, do you like me or not?
1087000	1091000	And this is the guy that works with her at Blockbuster.
1093000	1097000	And understands her and watches Downton Abbey.
1099000	1100000	It's nothing against you.
1100000	1102000	I've never lost anyone to you personally.
1102000	1105000	But it's just like, whenever I meet a girl who's got a guy
1105000	1108000	like you on the side, I'm like, you say whatever you want.
1108000	1110000	Because I know the first test is I'm supposed to go,
1110000	1111000	wouldn't you fuck him?
1111000	1112000	He's just a fucking girl.
1112000	1114000	So I know I'm not supposed to do that.
1114000	1116000	And so because I know I'm not supposed to do that,
1116000	1118000	I've watched like three girlfriends just go,
1118000	1122000	oh, like over with the China don't care guy.
1124000	1126000	And I'm just like, I'm 40 now.
1126000	1128000	I'm supposed to have 10-year-old kids by now.
1128000	1132000	But instead, I'm a fucking expert on that shit.
1133000	1138000	Spencer, what kind of dice can we roll to find out how this plays out?
1139000	1142000	If we're all characters in a certain campaign right now.
1142000	1145000	That'd be a diplomacy check, man.
1146000	1148000	That's a straightforward answer.
1149000	1152000	So it's not always impressive or interesting.
1152000	1154000	It's just rules.
1154000	1159000	Look, I'm not trying to be a bully.
1159000	1161000	I'm not trying to be a thug about this.
1161000	1165000	But I want to find out because we have a woman on stage named Lauren
1165000	1167000	said she wanted to make out with you.
1167000	1168000	Yeah.
1169000	1171000	Let's roll the dice on that.
1171000	1172000	Let's see what happens.
1172000	1173000	All right.
1173000	1174000	Critical.
1174000	1179000	Someone said that she took a critical tit, but that's probably stupid.
1179000	1182000	Feels like, yeah, now we're like, are we in Tarzana?
1182000	1184000	Shall I roll a dice?
1184000	1185000	Yes.
1185000	1187000	Spencer, do you hear the music?
1187000	1189000	What do I describe, though?
1189000	1190000	That's the describing music.
1190000	1193000	You describe you making out on stage.
1195000	1197000	Making out on the stage.
1198000	1200000	Everybody leaves.
1204000	1206000	All right.
1209000	1211000	He's not he's not he's not corruptible.
1211000	1212000	He's not viable.
1212000	1215000	I don't even get what's happening right now.
1215000	1216000	That's that's the plan.
1216000	1218000	No one wants you to just over my head.
1218000	1219000	I don't I don't.
1219000	1220000	I don't.
1220000	1221000	I don't.
1221000	1222000	Maybe I should sit up.
1222000	1224000	I said I declared in Portland hasn't aired yet.
1224000	1229000	But how about Brian's going to make out with Dan roll the dice on that one.
1234000	1235000	Fourteen man.
1235000	1236000	That's not bad.
1236000	1241000	But Spencer describe me succumbing to a homoerotic encounter.
1242000	1244000	Vibrate pink shirt approaching.
1244000	1249000	You see what can only be described as a way fish man from San Francisco approaching.
1250000	1252000	Caught off guard by his charms.
1252000	1254000	You take him to the green room.
1258000	1259000	That's all.
1260000	1262000	He can handle anything.
1262000	1263000	All right.
1263000	1265000	Let's check in with Ryan and Lauren later.
1265000	1266000	Right.
1266000	1267000	Lauren.
1267000	1269000	You're you have to kiss Brian.
1271000	1272000	Brian.
1272000	1274000	It was a for Brian.
1274000	1275000	Brian.
1275000	1277000	It was a 14 make out role.
1282000	1283000	It's Harman town.
1283000	1284000	Everyone's safe here.
1285000	1287000	It's Harman town and at San Francisco.
1288000	1290000	This is where anything can happen and will.
1290000	1291000	All right.
1291000	1293000	Brian and Lauren.
1293000	1294000	Right.
1294000	1295000	I know.
1295000	1297000	Someone be named Sasquatch or something.
1298000	1299000	Brian and Lauren everybody.
1299000	1300000	Thank you guys.
1301000	1303000	We'll check in with him later.
1305000	1306000	It's a runner.
1306000	1307000	It's what we call in TV writing.
1307000	1308000	It's called a runner.
1308000	1309000	It's not an A story.
1309000	1310000	It's not a B story.
1310000	1311000	It's a runner.
1311000	1312000	It's fun.
1312000	1315000	It's like a principal Belding is learning scuba diving.
1316000	1321000	It's not part of the, you know, like Zach is, you know, he's jealous of Schindler.
1321000	1322000	I don't know.
1323000	1325000	Well, he always hated Schindler.
1325000	1326000	Yeah.
1326000	1327000	Zach hated Schindler.
1330000	1333000	Bro, you got to put me on that list, bro.
1333000	1335000	We'll be right back.
1336000	1337000	Uh.

1348000	1350000	Where Greg Proops is definitely not going to show up, right?
1350000	1351000	No.
1351000	1352000	Greg Proops is almost certainly not going to show up.
1352000	1353000	But you know what?
1353000	1354000	Who is going to show up?
1354000	1356000	A special comedic guest.
1356000	1357000	No.
1357000	1359000	Funniest stand up in Harmon town history.
1359000	1360000	No.
1360000	1361000	Steve Ager.
1361000	1362000	Steve Ager.
1366000	1367000	That was it.

1425000	1428000	Did Molly, just a country named Molly get invented and?
1435000	1437000	Gun control on Molly.
1437000	1438000	Gun control?

1559000	1561000	You being the shirt.

1580000	1581000	What?
1581000	1585000	I don't know what that really means, so I'm going to hand it to you, Dan.
1585000	1586000	Tell me what it means.
1587000	1588000	Here's what it means.
1588000	1590000	It means I'm going to peel you out of those jeans.
1590000	1592000	I'm going to pull your pants down, around your knees.
1592000	1595000	I'm going to give you my banana and my two snow peas.
1597000	1598000	Yeah.
1598000	1599000	Wow.
1599000	1600000	Yes.
1600000	1601000	We're going to make love.
1601000	1603000	That's what it means.
1603000	1604000	This feels wonderful.
1604000	1605000	That's good.
1605000	1607000	It's funny because it's true.
1608000	1609000	Now, Dan...
1609000	1610000	Yes, Jeff?
1610000	1612000	This is the last stop on our tour.
1612000	1613000	Yes.
1613000	1614000	We've done how many dates?
1614000	1615000	19 dates?
1615000	1616000	A thousand?
1616000	1618000	I think this is the 20th one, I don't know.
1618000	1619000	This is it.
1619000	1620000	We go back home after this.
1620000	1621000	That's it, buddy.
1621000	1622000	That's it.
1622000	1623000	I know, but...
1623000	1625000	It couldn't happen in a nicer, safer, more wonderful place.
1625000	1626000	Don't be sad.
1626000	1629000	We're at the fucking punchline in San Francisco, California.
1629000	1630000	It's wonderful.
1630000	1632000	But Dan, do you feel melancholy about it?
1632000	1635000	How do you feel about this departure from this tour?
1635000	1636000	I feel...
1636000	1637000	No, I miss my cat.
1639000	1640000	Are you burping right now?
1640000	1641000	Yeah.
1642000	1644000	I'm bummed that Greg Proops isn't going to show up.
1644000	1646000	Greg Proops is never going to fucking be here.
1646000	1647000	Ever.
1647000	1649000	Even me saying that won't make him ironically show up?
1649000	1651000	He's not Beetlejuice.
1651000	1655000	Me saying his name three times does not make Greg Proops appear on stage.
1655000	1656000	All right.
1657000	1658000	Greg Proops, are you here?
1658000	1659000	See?
1659000	1660000	It's not going to happen.
1661000	1662000	All right.
1662000	1663000	He is?
1663000	1664000	Where?
1665000	1666000	Sketchfest.
1666000	1667000	Yeah?
1667000	1668000	Sidelines?
1668000	1669000	Is that what you said?
1669000	1670000	Hightlife?
1670000	1671000	Nightlife.
1671000	1672000	Nightlife.
1672000	1673000	That's a dumb name.
1673000	1674000	It's a gay bar, right?
1675000	1676000	Yeah.
1677000	1679000	It's a science museum?
1680000	1681000	And gay bar.
1682000	1684000	It's the only science museum.
1684000	1686000	The only science museum slash gay bar in town.
1686000	1690000	Jeff, I don't want to derail the show, but there was a girl came up to me.
1690000	1693000	I don't want to take this train off its rails.
1696000	1702000	But while Erin was up here, a girl who I couldn't see because it was in the darkness,
1702000	1706000	three minutes into Erin's shtick, whatever you call it.
1707000	1708000	Podcast.
1708000	1709000	And podcast.
1710000	1713000	And she bounded up to me and was near tears and said,
1714000	1716000	Dan, I got in a car accident.
1716000	1718000	And I was like, Jesus Christ, is someone dying?
1719000	1720000	And she said, I got in a car accident.
1720000	1721000	I was coming here.
1721000	1722000	I got in a car accident.
1722000	1723000	I was coming.
1723000	1724000	I got in a car accident.
1724000	1725000	It was a minute here in time.
1725000	1726000	And I was like, okay, just watch the show.
1726000	1727000	And what's that?
1728000	1729000	Okay, come up here.
1729000	1730000	Do you want it?
1730000	1731000	Can you come up here?
1731000	1733000	I just wanted to find out who you were.
1736000	1738000	Car accident lady.
1739000	1741000	Recently maimed.
1742000	1744000	I didn't mean to offend you.
1744000	1746000	I wanted to figure.
1749000	1750000	You were excited though, right?
1750000	1751000	It really happened.
1751000	1752000	I swear.
1752000	1753000	What was your name?
1753000	1754000	My name is Gabrielle.
1754000	1755000	Gabrielle.
1755000	1756000	What happened?
1756000	1757000	Tell me now, because I didn't want to be rude back there.
1757000	1760000	Because I don't want to be like an asshole blowing you off.
1760000	1761000	Car accident.
1761000	1762000	Yeah, what?
1762000	1763000	She's performing.
1763000	1764000	No, you were super sweet.
1764000	1765000	I had just been crying for like 10 minutes.
1765000	1767000	Because of the trauma?
1767000	1768000	No.
1768000	1770000	My mom said she was going to take my car away from me.
1770000	1771000	I'm 21.
1772000	1776000	So on top of the accident, like your mom's going to punish you and take the car away?
1776000	1777000	Exactly.
1777000	1778000	What's your mom's name?
1778000	1779000	Sharon.
1779000	1781000	She's an alcoholic bitch.
1783000	1784000	I live at home too.
1784000	1785000	Your mom is an alcoholic?
1785000	1786000	Yes, she is.
1786000	1788000	Who wouldn't give you the car?
1788000	1789000	Exactly.
1789000	1791000	When she gave it to you, you got in a wreck.
1792000	1793000	No, I drove her home.
1793000	1794000	Dan?
1794000	1795000	What?
1795000	1796000	Fuck her mama.
1799000	1800000	Isn't Sharon the...
1800000	1801000	Didn't we learn tonight?
1801000	1803000	That's the name of the guy that takes you across the River Styx?
1803000	1804000	Yes, exactly.
1804000	1805000	I actually said that.
1805000	1807000	I knew exactly who she was.
1808000	1809000	Whoa.
1809000	1810000	Sharon gave...
1810000	1813000	Yo, yo, yo.
1813000	1814000	I forgot your name.
1814000	1815000	Gabrielle.
1815000	1816000	Gabrielle.
1816000	1817000	Yo.
1817000	1818000	Gabrielle.
1819000	1820000	Yo.
1820000	1821000	Well, give me a second.
1821000	1822000	Yo.
1822000	1823000	Yo.
1823000	1824000	Yo.
1824000	1825000	Hey, Sharon.
1825000	1826000	Your daughter's on stage.
1826000	1827000	Got to talk to you about what you're doing to her.
1827000	1828000	Guys, start over.
1828000	1829000	Starting over.
1830000	1831000	It's in front of the top.
1831000	1832000	Ready?
1832000	1833000	Her name's Gabrielle.
1833000	1834000	Wait.
1834000	1836000	Do the Rihanna version so they can do the chorus.
1836000	1837000	Please, please do.
1837000	1839000	And let Gabrielle do the...
1839000	1840000	All right.
1840000	1841000	Let's see.
1842000	1845000	It's more of an M&M-y kind of thing.
1845000	1846000	It's melancholy.
1846000	1848000	Sharon, Gabrielle.
1849000	1850000	Yo.
1850000	1851000	San Francisco.
1851000	1852000	Yo.
1852000	1853000	Yo.
1853000	1854000	Bay Area.
1854000	1855000	Yo.
1855000	1856000	Scariest.
1856000	1857000	Don't want to scare you.
1857000	1858000	Bay Area.
1858000	1861000	Flowing rhymes like my name was Potter Harrier.
1861000	1862000	No.
1862000	1863000	No.
1863000	1864000	Just ignore that.
1864000	1865000	Just getting warmed up.
1865000	1866000	Yeah.
1866000	1867000	Yeah.
1867000	1868000	Warming up.
1868000	1869000	Got a girl up here named Gabrielle.
1869000	1873000	Got her mother that I want to tell her to go to hell.
1873000	1875000	Took her keys away because she was human.
1875000	1877000	You know what I'm doing?
1877000	1878000	I'm drunk, but I'm human.
1878000	1881000	We all get drunk too much sometimes,
1881000	1884000	but I'm going to spit a couple human rhymes
1884000	1887000	and let you know that your daughter's going to make mistakes.
1887000	1891000	She's only been here enough to eat 21 birthday cakes.
1891000	1894000	That was kind of a clever rhyme.
1894000	1897000	I won't get distracted by it, though.
1897000	1899000	I'll keep flowing.
1899000	1900000	Okay.
1900000	1901000	Sorry.
1901000	1902000	Okay.
1902000	1903000	Stay focused.
1903000	1907000	That was badass because the number of cakes measured her age.
1907000	1908000	Fuck.
1908000	1909000	All right.
1909000	1910000	And it rhymed with mistakes.
1910000	1912000	Come on down to Harman's town.
1912000	1915000	Turn that frown upside down.
1915000	1918000	Youth is yellow, poop is brown.
1918000	1921000	Come on down to Harman's town.
1921000	1923000	You know, Sharon, remember your daughter.
1923000	1926000	Remember when you used to navigate those youthful waters?
1926000	1928000	You were barely treading them.
1928000	1929000	You could hardly swim.
1929000	1931000	Do you remember Sharon's father?
1931000	1932000	Wait.
1932000	1933000	No, you're him.
1933000	1934000	It was Phillip.
1934000	1935000	Sorry.
1935000	1936000	I got mixed up.
1936000	1938000	I fucked your mama so hard she thought she was a pop.
1938000	1939000	This doesn't matter.
1939000	1940000	It's just like start over.
1940000	1941000	Starting over.
1941000	1944000	I fucked your mama so hard that Mars needed a rover.
1944000	1945000	Okay.
1945000	1946000	Yeah.
1946000	1947000	Okay.
1947000	1949000	Come on down to Harman's town.
1949000	1951000	Turn that frown upside down.
1951000	1952000	Starting over.
1952000	1954000	He is yellow, poop is brown.
1954000	1955000	Truth brown.
1955000	1957000	Come on down to Harman's town.
1957000	1960000	Gabrielle, your mom's name is Sharon.
1960000	1963000	We're going to do a rap that's going to teach her the meaning of Karen.
1963000	1967000	About her daughter don't take her car away just because she had a bad night
1967000	1969000	followed by a bad day.
1969000	1970000	She's in the Bay Area.
1970000	1972000	People grow here.
1972000	1974000	I don't care what they do.
1974000	1979000	If you bow here, then your lawn is your life.
1979000	1980000	It cuts like a knife.
1980000	1982000	Gabrielle, Gabrielle, go.
1982000	1984000	Come on down to Harman's town.
1984000	1987000	He is yellow, poop is brown.
1987000	1988000	Drunk.
1988000	1989000	He is yellow.
1989000	1990000	Gabrielle.
1990000	1991000	I fucked it up.
1991000	1992000	Gabrielle, rap.
1992000	1993000	Now you are.
1993000	1994000	Oh, my God.
1994000	1995000	It's Dan Harman.
1995000	1997000	I don't know what I'm doing here.
1997000	2002000	I don't know what I'm doing here.
2002000	2007000	I drank a lot of vodka beforehand and I'm confused.
2007000	2008000	Me too.
2008000	2011000	I like your dancing.
2011000	2013000	I'm really excited.
2013000	2015000	Oh, my God.
2015000	2016000	Your mom was invited.
2016000	2018000	I like your vibe.
2018000	2021000	But she didn't show up because she can't remember when,
2021000	2024000	before she grew up, that she used to be young,
2024000	2027000	she used to be used, and now she sits at home
2027000	2028000	and she just judges you.
2028000	2031000	She sits in the chair with the lamp next to her
2031000	2034000	like in a movie, like her name was Ben Hur.
2034000	2037000	Even though he didn't do that, he just drove a chariot.
2037000	2038000	Yeah.
2038000	2040000	But, you know, it's, you know.
2040000	2041000	He was a slave.
2041000	2042000	Jared, did you see what it worked there?
2042000	2044000	Come on down to Harman's town.
2044000	2045000	Ignore it.
2045000	2052000	I forgot my part.
2052000	2055000	Yo, I'm so drunk that I'm blind.
2055000	2059000	I never thought I'd go to a city and find a more forgiving
2059000	2062000	group of people than in the San Fran.
2062000	2065000	I fucked your mama because my name is Dan.
2065000	2067000	H-A-T-R-M-O-N.
2067000	2070000	I'm gonna fuck your mama two times then again.
2070000	2074000	I'm gonna fuck your daddy two because this is a great place.
2074000	2077000	I'm gonna fuck your dad and come on your mama's face.
2077000	2078000	Yeah.
2078000	2083000	It seems gross to hear it, but it's both what they need in their spirit.
2083000	2084000	Spencer. Spencer.
2084000	2085000	Come on down.
2085000	2086000	Harbin' town.
2086000	2089000	Turn that frown upside down.
2089000	2090000	Rap.
2090000	2092000	P-N yellow poop is rap.
2092000	2093000	Come on down.
2093000	2094000	Spencer.
2094000	2095000	Go Spencer.
2095000	2097000	Yo, Gabrielle, your mom is a bitch.
2097000	2099000	I bet her heart is kind of black.
2099000	2100000	It's dark like pitch.
2100000	2104000	You don't really want to mind what she says because everybody knows
2104000	2106000	that behind the scenes she's pleasant.
2106000	2109000	All around and everybody enjoys it.
2109000	2113000	Everybody want to find something to see in a pit.
2113000	2115000	Everybody loving the show.
2115000	2119000	Stop going and then we'll go to the chorus.
2119000	2122000	Come on down to Harbin' town.
2122000	2125000	Turn that frown upside down.
2125000	2128000	P-N yellow poop is rap.
2128000	2130000	Turn that frown upside down.
2130000	2131000	Harbin' town.
2131000	2134000	Yo, why's your mom so mad because you crashed a car?
2134000	2135000	She just gave me a picture.
2135000	2138000	Dan's gonna open a pussy like it's some kind of pussy jar.
2138000	2140000	Gonna fuck her in the hole.
2140000	2145000	Pull it out and fuck her and make her hole come right between her eyes
2145000	2150000	and then put his soft dick right between her warm thighs.
2150000	2152000	Yo, A.G. Yeah.
2152000	2154000	Yeah, that's what she's gonna do.
2154000	2155000	Yeah.
2155000	2157000	Come on down to Harbin' town.
2157000	2160000	Turn that frown upside down.
2160000	2163000	P-N yellow poop is rap.
2163000	2166000	Come on down to Harbin' town.
2166000	2168000	Gabrielle, everybody.
2168000	2170000	Gabrielle, thank you for that.
2170000	2171000	I'm sorry.
2171000	2172000	I'm sorry, Gabrielle.
2172000	2175000	I'm so sorry that you're okay and no one got hurt, right?
2175000	2176000	Do you want to hear what happened?
2176000	2177000	Yeah, let's hear what happened.
2177000	2178000	I'm driving down Clay Street.
2178000	2180000	She killed three children and now we've got to...
2180000	2182000	Yo, yo, no, children died.
2182000	2183000	It's okay.
2183000	2185000	My chicken's super fried.
2185000	2186000	My chicken's super fried.
2186000	2188000	Oh, dead children are fun.
2188000	2191000	Watch the bubble gum.
2191000	2192000	Go ahead, sorry.
2192000	2195000	No, it's actually more comical than that.
2195000	2198000	This guy opened his door in front of me while I was driving
2198000	2201000	and I crunched and he was like, gah!
2201000	2202000	And he was really upset about it.
2202000	2204000	And I was like, you have a really pleasant accent,
2204000	2206000	but I feel like you can't acknowledge it
2206000	2209000	while we're exchanging, like, information.
2209000	2211000	Oh, God, it was like a Judd Apatow movie.
2211000	2212000	Yeah!
2213000	2214000	Who's from Ethiopia?
2216000	2218000	Well, I mean, he's not here tonight, right?
2218000	2219000	No.
2219000	2221000	So if he was, we could fix this, I'm sure.
2221000	2222000	No.
2222000	2223000	I'm sorry, Gabriel.
2225000	2226000	Why?
2230000	2232000	Apatow, going to the place to be.
2232000	2235000	I got an Apatow, pow wow, chicken and frick a seed.
2235000	2237000	I put my Apatow.
2237000	2239000	Oh, oh, no.
2239000	2241000	Well, don't play it if you don't want.
2242000	2244000	I don't know.
2244000	2245000	You're not controlling it.
2245000	2248000	We've reached the end and you're like, what are you doing?
2250000	2251000	What do you want?
2251000	2256000	I want Gabriel to either feel better or go away.
2258000	2261000	I want to do a good show.
2261000	2263000	I want to probe deep into San Francisco.
2263000	2264000	I want to touch these people.
2264000	2266000	I want to make them feel like they got their money's worth.
2266000	2269000	I feel touched as I've been physically touched.
2270000	2273000	I don't think you guys have crossed over into the realm of being touched.
2273000	2275000	I feel like it's still very superficial.
2275000	2276000	You guys could get closer.
2276000	2277000	Okay.
2277000	2278000	Well, okay.
2278000	2280000	Do a quick biopic about you and your mom.
2280000	2281000	Oh, Jesus.
2281000	2282000	Okay.
2282000	2283000	One to grow on.
2286000	2290000	Sharon is your mother, Gabriel.
2293000	2294000	That's the other way around?
2294000	2295000	Yes, it is.
2295000	2297000	Well, that's the twist.
2298000	2301000	It's one of those body switching movies.
2301000	2303000	This was a sneak preview.
2303000	2308000	It's one of those movies that starts and then the title card says five years earlier.
2309000	2313000	Gabriel, I found a magic skull.
2315000	2320000	You better not touch it at the same time as me or we'll both turn into each other.
2320000	2321000	I know.
2321000	2325000	We'll make your abandonment issues turn into mine.
2325000	2328000	You shut the hell up, you young bitch.
2328000	2333000	If I had your life, I'd do everything different.
2333000	2335000	I'm a drunk old bitch.
2335000	2337000	Don't you touch the skull.
2337000	2338000	Oh, no.
2338000	2340000	We're switching places.
2341000	2343000	Body switching movies.
2343000	2345000	It's got you like some stanchion eyebrows.
2346000	2347000	I'm a neurobiology major.
2347000	2349000	I say things like that.
2349000	2352000	I'm 21 years old, but I'm still a bitch.
2353000	2355000	I got to go to your college classes.
2355000	2357000	Give me your transcripts.
2359000	2363000	You go to my job as a CEO at Bitch Corp.
2366000	2368000	Three hours later at Bitch Corp.
2368000	2372000	By the way, worst musical score ever for a movie?
2372000	2374000	Worst, the worst.
2374000	2376000	She has really shitty taste in music.
2376000	2379000	She lives in the like old queen all the time.
2380000	2383000	This is the commentary track with you.
2383000	2386000	When your mom listens to the same stuff over and over again,
2386000	2389000	then you're like, fuck, don't play that shit again.
2389000	2391000	I'm going to hit you in the face.
2393000	2396000	I have some of the qualms about your taste.
2396000	2398000	I don't like Chumbawumba.
2401000	2402000	Coldplay.
2402000	2406000	In my day, it was either cold or you played it.
2406000	2408000	You can't do both.
2409000	2411000	You know what, that's not right anymore.
2411000	2412000	Yeah, okay.
2412000	2413000	Oh, we're changing back.
2413000	2414000	Whoa!
2414000	2416000	Body switching resolved.
2416000	2417000	It's like freaking Friday.
2417000	2420000	I'm going to be a different kind of bitch from now on.
2420000	2421000	Please do.
2421000	2423000	Just take...
2431000	2433000	Hey, take the keys to my car.
2433000	2435000	What a good movie this was.
2435000	2437000	Yay!
2437000	2438000	Gabrielle, ladies and gentlemen.
2438000	2439000	Thank you.
2439000	2440000	Good job.
2444000	2445000	What are you doing?
2445000	2446000	What are you doing?
2446000	2448000	I played Queen.
2448000	2450000	You said Queen.
2452000	2454000	Last show of the tour, man.
2454000	2455000	I know.
2455000	2457000	It's a bummer.
2457000	2458000	What have we learned?
2458000	2461000	Have we grown at all, those people?
2461000	2463000	I think we have.
2464000	2466000	I know I have, you guys.
2469000	2472000	From this one show that I've joined you on.
2474000	2476000	How do you think we've grown, Steve?
2476000	2477000	You know, the road's hard.
2477000	2479000	You deal and you move on.
2479000	2482000	I know I've grown to the point where I no longer need a belt.
2482000	2485000	Like, I used to need a belt.
2485000	2491000	I know that I've grown to the point where I can't wait to go look at my mirror at home,
2491000	2494000	which was twice as wide, because I did the one on the bus,
2494000	2497000	like it's designed for people who fit on the bus.
2497000	2505000	I know that the amount of sweat pouring out of me per day has reached Ron Jeremy proportions.
2505000	2507000	I've grown biologically.
2507000	2510000	I've grown organically.
2512000	2513000	Oh.
2513000	2515000	Oh, shit.
2518000	2519000	No.
2519000	2520000	Great proof.
2520000	2521000	It couldn't happen.
2521000	2526000	Great proof, everybody.
2526000	2529000	Great proof.
2529000	2532000	It's on like Grey Poupon.
2538000	2541000	Jeff, you told me there was no chance.
2541000	2544000	I didn't know that Greg even existed.
2544000	2546000	I don't actually exist.
2546000	2548000	I'm an ephemeral miasma.
2548000	2550000	Ephemeral.
2550000	2551000	Stop.
2551000	2552000	Stop.
2552000	2553000	Greg Poup's.
2553000	2555000	Greg Poup's, right.
2555000	2561000	Have you ever walked through a swamp and seen green, you know, swamp gas coming up
2561000	2563000	and you go like, was that for real?
2563000	2566000	That's what it's like.
2567000	2569000	That's what it's like to do what?
2569000	2571000	To be me.
2571000	2572000	Great.
2572000	2576000	When you enter the punch line, when you come to the financial district this late at night
2576000	2579000	and go, it's all in order.
2579000	2583000	A very special edition of Sports Corner with Greg Poup's.
2583000	2585000	Sports Corner.
2585000	2588000	Sports Corner.
2591000	2593000	Sports Corner.
2593000	2599000	When you get Greg Poup's, they're going to talk about the San Francisco 49ers.
2599000	2605000	You know, even though we're the gayest team in the NFL, we hate gays the most.
2605000	2607000	And that's what makes, thank you.
2607000	2610000	That's what makes us awesome.
2610000	2615000	We apologized for it because we knew it was out of line, but fucking we said it and we
2615000	2617000	didn't really mean it, okay?
2617000	2622000	Our gay brothers and sisters help us win the Super Bowl by being there for us and holding
2622000	2624000	our balls.
2624000	2628000	Greg, do you know the two teams that are playing in the Super Bowl?
2628000	2629000	Thanks, Steve.
2629000	2630000	Thanks, Steve.
2630000	2631000	I do.
2631000	2635000	I don't like your audience, unlike your audience, Dan.
2636000	2639000	I don't just read graphic novels all day.
2639000	2640000	I participate.
2640000	2642000	That's right.
2642000	2645000	Straight white guy world is not a world that I'm unacquainted with.
2645000	2650000	I didn't vote for Mitt Romney, and yet I know some of the things his people know.
2650000	2656000	For instance, I know that the Baltimore Ravens, who hilariously are named after Edgar Allen
2656000	2661000	Poe, who would have been absolutely stunned and shocked that an NFL team would have his
2661000	2663000	name.
2663000	2665000	The Baltimore Ravens, for real?
2665000	2667000	They used to be called the Baltimore Minkins.
2667000	2670000	It was all H.L. Minkin.
2670000	2673000	While I pondered, we can worry once upon a midnight dreary.
2673000	2674000	For reals?
2674000	2675000	That's a football team?
2675000	2676000	Okay.
2676000	2681000	Is it really just because they're Ravens that automatically is named after Edgar Allen Poe?
2681000	2682000	He's the bard of Baltimore, yes.
2682000	2683000	I can't think of another one.
2683000	2684000	Oh, okay.
2684000	2685000	All right, go.
2685000	2686000	And then the Niners.
2686000	2692000	My beloved San Francisco Niners who I've ... I didn't love them.
2692000	2695000	I'm not a Johnny Comelele ever since they won their third Super Bowl.
2695000	2697000	I've been down.
2697000	2698000	I'm joking.
2698000	2701000	A Super Bowl is an event that happens when ... never mind.
2701000	2702000	You guys don't know.
2702000	2703000	In any case ...
2703000	2704000	They really do.
2704000	2706000	I don't know if they do or don't.
2706000	2711000	I do a bit called Sports Corner where I talk as earnestly as I can about sports, and it's
2711000	2713000	funny because I know nothing about sports.
2713000	2715000	That's what's going to make this awesome.
2715000	2716000	Sports Corner!
2717000	2722000	Was that the ending of Sports Corner, or is this the beginning?
2722000	2723000	A new beginning.
2723000	2724000	Oh, we're beginning.
2724000	2725000	Okay.
2725000	2726000	A new beginning.
2726000	2733000	So, here we are at Sports Corner.
2733000	2738000	I think that the 49ers are going to beat the Ravens, and here's why.
2738000	2742000	I think that their yardage will be better.
2742000	2743000	I think that they'll ...
2743000	2750000	Can we do a Sports Corner where it's as though Edgar Allan Poe was doing a Sports Corner?
2750000	2753000	An all Edgar Allan Poe themed Sports Center?
2753000	2756000	Alex Smith, whose head was bleary.
2756000	2758000	Smashed and smitten.
2758000	2760000	Horrible and teary.
2760000	2763000	And yet Kaepernick did kiss his guns.
2763000	2765000	And upon this day did kiss his guns.
2765000	2766000	And many runs.
2766000	2768000	And many runs.
2768000	2780000	And Vernon Davis, with great temerity, we did not upon his sincerity.
2780000	2782000	And Alex Smith sat upon the bench.
2782000	2783000	His head is spinning.
2783000	2785000	The phone are ringing.
2785000	2786000	The phone are ringing.
2786000	2787000	Answer the phone.
2787000	2792000	The phone's not ringing, but Alex Smith thought the phone was ringing.
2792000	2795000	And Harbaugh won and Harbaugh too.
2795000	2797000	And Harbaugh won and Harbaugh ye knew.
2797000	2800000	Because Harbaugh won was of that crew.
2800000	2803000	And Harbaugh too was of you too.
2803000	2808000	And we knew that Harbaugh would say, run there, run.
2808000	2811000	Oh, Negro in the field.
2811000	2813000	And the Negro would run.
2813000	2814000	And the ball would be ...
2814000	2815000	Sports Corner.
2815000	2816000	Sports Corner.
2816000	2819000	Edgar Allan Poe edition.
2819000	2822000	Sports Corner.
2822000	2825000	Greg, since we have you here, it's been a long time ...
2825000	2826000	Am I here?
2826000	2827000	All right.
2827000	2828000	How am I doing?
2828000	2829000	All right.
2829000	2830000	Yeah.
2830000	2831000	Are you in town?
2831000	2835000	Maybe we could play, since we have you, and we have Steve Agy, and we have Spencer.
2835000	2838000	Maybe we could do a little D&D.
2838000	2840000	Let's get it on.
2840000	2841000	Yeah.
2841000	2845000	Aaron McGaffey, back to the stage.
2845000	2846000	Aaron McGaffey.
2846000	2848000	Is Aaron still here?
2848000	2849000	Aaron McGaffey.
2849000	2850000	Aaron, could you ...
2850000	2851000	Hi, Aaron.
2851000	2852000	Seven microphones.
2852000	2853000	There you go.
2853000	2854000	Lauren and Brian.
2854000	2855000	I'm so sorry.
2855000	2856000	All this pressure.
2856000	2857000	Okay.
2857000	2858000	Good.
2858000	2859000	What pressure?
2859000	2860000	Oh, I missed that.
2860000	2861000	I was in here earlier.
2861000	2862000	I set them up during the show.
2862000	2867000	And when I was backstage, it sounded like they were being made to have sex on stage
2867000	2868000	in front of everyone.
2868000	2869000	Did they?
2869000	2870000	No.
2870000	2871000	No.
2871000	2872000	No.
2872000	2873000	No.
2873000	2874000	No.
2874000	2875000	No.
2875000	2876000	No.
2876000	2877000	No.
2877000	2878000	No.
2878000	2879000	No.
2879000	2880000	No.
2880000	2881000	Did they?
2881000	2882000	No.
2882000	2883000	Oh, how disappointing.
2883000	2884000	Not yet.
2884000	2885000	Lauren ...
2885000	2886000	If you've ever been to Amsterdam, you can see that.
2886000	2890040	And it's extraordinarily disappointing.
2890040	2893400	There really is nothing more disappointing than two people copulating in front of you,
2893400	2901000	unless it's been recorded on film by Czechoslovakian coke slaves, then it's always titillating.
2901000	2903000	Who's with me?
2903000	2907760	Greg, the last time that Dan and I were here, we watched your show.
2907760	2908760	Dan and I did.
2908760	2909760	And Jeff.
2909760	2912600	But afterwards, that was the first time that Dan and I said, I love you to each other.
2912600	2914880	After your show here.
2914880	2918720	I don't want to say that my show is a cataclysmic event that forces people to realize their
2918720	2921300	deepest emotional needs.
2921300	2925880	But in this instance, I think it did precipitate a little bit of what only can be described
2925880	2932720	now as an internal Alouise and Abelard love, where letters will be writ.
2932720	2933720	That's right.
2933720	2934720	I hope that's good.
2934720	2935720	In future.
2935720	2943480	Dan and Abelard were in a graphic novel a couple of years ago.
2943480	2949000	Spencer, we've forced you now to probably call a couple of audibles and bring it.
2949000	2950400	Am I the only one who's been drinking?
2950400	2951400	I hope not.
2951400	2953400	No, we're all very, very drunk.
2953400	2955240	What do you think?
2955240	2958160	Have you heard me hit one consonant the entire night?
2958160	2960040	Did you just say confiment?
2960040	2961040	Yes.
2961680	2966200	Greg, if I find out you've been smoking dope or doing any fucking alcohol.
2966200	2971640	What are you going to do?
2971640	2975400	It's like a party of friends and family.
2975400	2976920	That's all I've been doing.
2976920	2978040	It's sketch fast.
2978040	2982040	We don't get paid.
2982040	2983040	We don't get paid, right?
2983040	2984040	No, no.
2984040	2988120	All right, Spencer, do your best or do your worst.
2988120	2993360	Bring us up to date on our campaign, if you would.
2993360	2999080	When we last met, the party was still trapped in the confines of the Infinifish.
2999080	3004000	After taking out a lung and destroying the kidney, the party took on a tricky slime and
3004000	3006880	discovered a magical and bloody book.
3006880	3013120	All right, sliding through a sphincter, the group faced off with a beast's heart, guarded
3013120	3016800	by an eyestock, tentacles, and gas venting tubes.
3016800	3019360	The fight grew fierce and our heroes were wounded.
3019360	3023600	In the shadow of desperation, Jeff learned that his mysterious dagger was intelligent
3023600	3027280	and could talk.
3027280	3032760	Regrouping against the nefarious organ system, our heroes face down their fleshy foe.
3032760	3036800	The wounded heart thumps loudly as the whole fish quakes wildly.
3036800	3041040	You feel sickened from the orange powder drifting through the air from the ceiling.
3041040	3043640	The eyestock reopens its injured eye.
3043640	3046800	The tendril guarding of the organ whips around wildly.
3046800	3049440	It is time to fight.
3049440	3051840	Spencer, everybody.
3051840	3053240	Spencer.
3053240	3054240	Wow.
3054240	3063720	I want to, I want to, uh, you warned us in the green room that we need to like, uh, uh,
3063720	3065440	hit point up because we're about to die.
3065440	3066440	Yeah.
3066440	3067720	Do you guys want your character sheets?
3067720	3070160	Yeah, I get the character sheets out.
3070160	3075600	I take my magical, uh, uh, shards out, uh, my crystals and I, I use them to heal up
3075600	3076920	the group.
3076920	3083240	I take my healing crystals out to, uh, pulling the healing frisk of crystals from your satchel.
3083240	3087280	You rub them on your body before tossing them towards your teammates.
3087280	3090240	There are people who, there are people who know how to play D and D who listen to us
3090240	3094280	play and who are keen to the fact that what we're playing is a kind of a lightened version
3094280	3099320	of it, but they, and they sometimes ask, do you guys are, is it possible for you to die?
3099320	3100320	What would Spencer do?
3100320	3102040	Is he just keeping you alive?
3102040	3104520	He told us backstage, you're about to die.
3104520	3108960	You, I require you to heal yourselves when we start the next round.
3108960	3109960	It's important.
3109960	3116320	I, I take, I take out my loot and I, I start strumming cords and I know that I can't summon
3116320	3117320	animals.
3117320	3118320	I can speak to them.
3118320	3125680	And yet I try my hardest as a known barbarian with my magical loot to play a song that will
3125680	3141120	summon a unicorn to come to our age.
3141120	3144040	What summoning is this?
3144040	3149640	What festive music do I hear upon my ears like a thousand or boreal butterflies sent
3149640	3153480	into my oral faculties?
3153480	3160600	What gay wind blows, Tylenol with codeine, is that you?
3160600	3162640	Hey, hooray.
3162640	3171000	Cause I come hither from harky, bulgy wood and oh my god, the purple darkness doth envelop
3171000	3174540	me and now once again into the pink light I am born.
3174540	3178240	How grateful I am to see thee once again, all thee three.
3178240	3180680	Aye, and I'm so happy to see you.
3180680	3184440	Since we last met I, I put on a belt and now I'm a woman.
3184440	3188680	Not only are you a woman, you are boom-troculous.
3188680	3195320	And even in my anodyne, a unicorn state, which is ambis-sexual, a giant horn have I for you?
3195320	3198160	Oh my.
3198160	3203440	Tylenol, uh, many weeks have we been trapped inside this infinifish.
3203440	3207360	We've, we've knocked out the heart, the lungs, but we're still not free.
3207360	3209640	Do you have any advice?
3210400	3217240	Further than advice I shall give thee, for my magic horn is made of golden corn.
3217240	3223720	And as a key to most things infernal, this infinifish doth not vex me in any way.
3223720	3231320	Watch, I but fart in its general direction, lavender violets that doth winnow down its
3231320	3234360	defenses in an immense way.
3234760	3236760	Scorch.
3236760	3243320	Unleashing a powerful flatulence from the rear end, it dissipates into the infinifishes
3243320	3245600	and sides.
3245600	3246600	To no effect?
3246600	3247600	To no effect.
3247600	3248600	Oh no.
3248600	3254000	Tis but the first show, I have another one, twice nightly am I.
3254000	3257000	I, I examine our surroundings once again Spencer.
3257000	3260680	You're being accosted by the forces of the interior infinifish.
3260680	3262720	I leap aboard, uh, aboard.
3262800	3271040	I leap on top of, uh, of Tylenol, uh, and, and use his horn to ram, uh, the, uh, the
3271040	3275920	indeed, thy horn is formidable, thy man-bag scant.
3279920	3286920	With my scant man-bag, I, I, I leap, I leap aboard the formidable horned unicorn and try
3286920	3289200	to ram the exterior of the infinifish.
3289200	3291760	Well, is that okay with you?
3292720	3294720	Roger, Dodger.
3294720	3301200	Leaping a stride, the horse with a horn on top of it colloquially referred to as a unicorn.
3301200	3305520	The two of you in unison charge directly towards the heart or?
3305520	3306720	The exterior, the wall.
3306720	3307720	The wall?
3307720	3310640	Uh, uh, uh, uh, the heart, the heart, I meant the heart.
3310640	3313040	The wall?
3313040	3317240	Charging directly at the heart, you, uh, do you slash or do you just ram him with the
3317240	3318240	horn?
3318240	3320600	Ramming speed.
3320600	3324520	You fly right by the heart and plant yourself in the far wall.
3324520	3330960	Gentlemen, I, I do feel we would be greatly helped by a cleric.
3330960	3333320	If only there was a cleric.
3333320	3335600	Well, there's not.
3335600	3344160	However, with a convenient schlo-roop of a sphincter, out pops Valicent, the prince you've
3344160	3346600	met no only just before.
3347600	3350600	Hey!
3350600	3352600	What's happening?
3352600	3354600	Wow, uh, Valicent too.
3354600	3357600	Tonight, the role of Valicent will be played by Steve Agely.
3357600	3360600	Your, your enthusiasm has risen.
3360600	3362600	It is human in here.
3362600	3364600	Woo!
3364600	3368600	Valicent, use your fire sword and swipe at the heart.
3368600	3373600	I swipe a mighty swipe at the heart of the infinifish.
3373600	3379600	Brandishing your golden sword, you swipe a mighty swipe towards the wall of the infinifish.
3379600	3381600	Greg, sit down.
3381600	3386600	You notice that your sword goes wide and the blast not emanated from your blade instead
3386600	3389600	strikes one of the tentacles flailing about.
3389600	3394600	It severs the tentacle cleanly and the tip falls off onto the floor.
3394600	3395600	All right.
3395600	3396600	You're welcome!
3396600	3398600	Could be worse.
3398600	3399600	What?
3399600	3401600	Could be worse, but that was not bad.
3401600	3402600	So, so the heart is done?
3402600	3403600	The heart isn't done.
3403600	3405600	You, he missed and hit something else.
3405600	3406600	A tentacle.
3406600	3407600	The tentacle.
3407600	3408600	Yeah.
3408600	3409600	You're getting attacked.
3409600	3414600	I, I look from side to side and I pull out of my...
3414600	3416600	As you're attacked.
3416600	3417600	As I'm attacked?
3417600	3418600	Yeah.
3418600	3420600	I was saying you're attacked because that's happening.
3420600	3423600	This infinifish is most vexing.
3423600	3426600	Fuck at this, I say.
3426600	3427600	Steady.
3427600	3429600	How about a torpedo from my ass that I have borne?
3429600	3430600	Steady.
3430600	3434600	Tentacle steady.
3434600	3435600	Sorry.
3435600	3438600	Exuberant I have become.
3438600	3441600	Backwards thou, Tux.
3441600	3444600	Indeed thou, Sest.
3444600	3448600	The heart gives an almighty thump and you feel the ground shaking.
3448600	3452600	Spikes and some sort of things fall from the ceiling.
3452600	3456600	The battleground has become very dangerous.
3456600	3461600	No one gets hurt though.
3461600	3462600	But be careful.
3462600	3463600	Just be careful you guys.
3463600	3466600	I'm bringing sexy back.
3466600	3467600	Yep.
3467600	3468600	Just the camera shook a little bit.
3468600	3471600	What power is this unicorn has, Spencer?
3471600	3472600	Powers.
3472600	3473600	You can heal.
3473600	3474600	You can teleport within a forest.
3474600	3476600	You're not within a forest.
3476600	3479600	Also the power of, whoa, what's that?
3479600	3480600	That's what?
3480600	3482600	The power, the shock, it's shocking.
3482600	3484600	It's shocking and entertaining.
3484600	3489600	The infinifish may feel the unicorn, see the unicorn inside of himself and be like,
3489600	3491600	wow, cool.
3491600	3494600	That's a good point.
3494600	3495600	Please don't tweet me that I don't know about you.
3495600	3496600	I'm just a dragon.
3496600	3497600	It's a bet.
3497600	3498600	I'm sorry.
3498600	3499600	It's okay.
3499600	3500600	Flaming sword.
3500600	3502600	It's good.
3502600	3503600	At the heart.
3503600	3505600	I do a flaming sword attack.
3505600	3512600	Wielding your flaming sword in a vicious manner, you brandish it towards the giant heart.
3512600	3515600	Striking the surface of the heart, you score a flaming blow.
3515600	3518600	The wound is cauterized in.
3518600	3521600	It gets hurt.
3521600	3522600	Excellent.
3522600	3528600	I remove two arrows.
3528600	3529600	The arrows.
3529600	3530600	The good ones.
3530600	3532600	First the Ted Nugent one.
3532600	3537600	And then the Green Lantern.
3537600	3538600	Steady.
3538600	3539600	Steady, Tylenol.
3539600	3545600	I mount Tylenol, so I'm able to see the heart and also because I would like to mount Tylenol.
3545600	3553600	Thou art not the first heart to mount me in this land.
3553600	3556600	She laughed gaily.
3556600	3558600	Oh, your back is so broad.
3558600	3563600	And my haunches formidable.
3563600	3567600	Your mane, your mane smells like lavender.
3567600	3571600	I've washed it and minced it in the recent past.
3571600	3573600	Whoa, you bucked.
3573600	3575600	And I put my tooth on the microphone.
3575600	3577600	You're bucking.
3577600	3578600	I did not expect...
3578600	3581600	Like a zebra, I rock you stripe after stripe.
3581600	3584600	And yet, alternatively...
3584600	3586600	I've never been happier.
3586600	3589600	I orgasm as I shoot two arrows.
3589600	3591600	That was unanticipated.
3591600	3594600	And yet, bonus.
3594600	3600600	You're shaking wildly from the bucking of the horse and the orgasm of your hips.
3600600	3604600	That's what I call a quiver.
3604600	3608600	A pie.
3608600	3613600	Ee, ee, ee, ee...
3613600	3616600	Ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.
3616600	3618600	Y'all ready for this?
3618600	3619600	Yeah.
3619600	3624600	All the same, your arrows go wide and plant themselves in the membrane wall of the chamber.
3624600	3627600	It's fine, I'm still smiling.
3627600	3628600	You're still happy.
3628600	3632600	Scorching rain!
3639600	3642600	Scorching rain!
3642600	3651600	Sharpie, Sharpie, you're really fucked up right now, man.
3651600	3656600	That's what they came to say, isn't it, you sons of bitches?
3656600	3661600	Eat fucking robots! Eat consumers!
3661600	3663600	Sharpie.
3663600	3667600	Father, I want to fuck you!
3667600	3671600	Scorching rain!
3671600	3673600	I don't know.
3673600	3679600	I was doing it for the tour movie.
3679600	3685600	Conjuring up magical flames, you launch a scorching ray directly at the heart of the heart.
3685600	3693600	It strikes directly in the heart and deals what appears to be 20 damage.
3693600	3698600	Scorching rain!
3698600	3701600	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3701600	3704600	Take it off!
3704600	3713600	Sharpie, Sharpie, Sharpie.
3713600	3719600	Even though I am immortal, this sight shall I never forget.
3719600	3722600	Dan Harmon is wearing camouflage boxers.
3722600	3727600	Yeah, for the podcast, Dan took off his pants, he's wearing camo boxers.
3727600	3730600	And then he ingested two beverages at once.
3730600	3732600	Both hands.
3732600	3736600	Some things one can never unsee.
3736600	3740600	This is our Vietnam.
3740600	3743600	I strike with my emerald dagger towards the heart.
3743600	3745600	Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
3745600	3746600	I would love that.
3746600	3747600	Judges, stop!
3747600	3750600	Instead, the heart shudders before glowing brightly.
3750600	3753600	It emits a blast of light and you all take 10 damage.
3753600	3754600	Fucking hell.
3754600	3755600	That shit.
3755600	3756600	Sometimes you get damaged.
3756600	3761600	All right, then I take my emerald dagger out and I go into a berserker rage.
3761600	3763600	Hey, man, do you think that's a good idea?
3763600	3764600	Huh?
3764600	3765600	That's your dagger talking.
3765600	3767600	Hey, man, do you think that's a good idea?
3767600	3770600	Hey, dagger, you and I have been through a lot of bullshit together.
3770600	3771600	Yeah, man.
3771600	3772600	Now's no time to fucking fight.
3772600	3774600	I need you as much as you need me.
3774600	3779600	You should take out that other orange thing hanging from the ceiling that you killed one of in the last episode.
3779600	3782600	The tangerine of doom!
3782600	3786600	I remember that there's another orange nerve sac.
3786600	3787600	Yep.
3787600	3789600	The apricot of killing!
3789600	3793600	I take my emerald dagger and I plunge myself.
3793600	3794600	I leap.
3794600	3802600	I jump on top of Tylenol with codeine and he circles around the room in ever increasing spirals.
3802600	3809600	And as we arise up to the height of the orange nerve sac, I swipe with my emerald dagger.
3809600	3814600	Leaping a stride, your horse with a horn colloquially you return to as I can't even talk.
3814600	3820600	You ride across the floor of the chamber and as you charge up the wall, you leap off your unicorn,
3820600	3828600	plunging the mysterious emerald dagger directly into the heart of the orange apricot of doom.
3828600	3836600	There's a brilliant green blast of light and it deals something around eight damage, striking the nerve directly.
3836600	3840600	It explodes, emitting a blast of purple powder.
3840600	3843600	You feel dizzy and weak all the same.
3843600	3845600	You feel like you've accomplished something great.
3845600	3846600	Hold your breath!
3846600	3850600	The Infinifish gives a great shudder as if it's been violently wounded.
3850600	3851600	It's on the ropes.
3851600	3855600	Hey guys, you guys have to try this purple powder man.
3855600	3857600	Give me drugs.
3857600	3859600	Give me drugs.
3859600	3863600	Great leaping armadillos.
3864600	3866600	This can portend no good.
3866600	3872600	Like Liz Taylor at a banquet, you're informal before the main course.
3874600	3877600	Steady, Tylenol. Steady, lad.
3877600	3879600	From the line I shall hold.
3881600	3882600	How far away is the heart?
3882600	3884600	The heart's a good 20 feet off.
3884600	3885600	Can I jump that far?
3885600	3886600	You can run that far.
3886600	3889600	I run that far and stab at the heart.
3889600	3890600	Flash at the heart.
3890600	3892600	Or close sword. I mean, either way.
3892600	3895600	Close sword the heart. Close sword it.
3895600	3898600	Striking directly at the surface of the heart,
3898600	3901600	you manage to cut a wide blow on its side.
3901600	3903600	Use the big dive.
3906600	3908600	Dealing 14 damage.
3908600	3910600	14!
3913600	3915600	I take a single...
3915600	3916600	Y'all ready for this?
3916600	3918600	I take a single arrow,
3918600	3922600	and I'm really, really trying this time.
3922600	3925600	And I shoot it directly at the heart.
3925600	3929600	I smile at everyone, I wave my hair, and I giggle.
3929600	3931600	And then I shoot the arrow.
3931600	3933600	You know those things lessen your accuracy.
3933600	3935600	Giggling? Giggling?
3935600	3937600	No, like shaking will totally throw off your...
3937600	3940600	Have you ever... Just shoot an arrow.
3940600	3943600	Leave us out of it. Just shoot the arrow at the heart.
3943600	3944600	Oh, fuck.
3944600	3946600	Yeah, shoot the arrow.
3946600	3948600	Because I just rolled the attack.
3948600	3950600	Who broke my heart?
3950600	3952600	You did, you did.
3952600	3954600	Straight to the target.
3956600	3958600	You think you're smart.
3958600	3960600	Stupid, stupid.
3960600	3964600	Shoot that poison arrow at my heart.
3964600	3965600	Jackpot.
3965600	3967600	I shoot my arrow.
3970600	3971600	Wow.
3971600	3972600	That was so funny.
3972600	3974600	ABC snaps.
3974600	3976600	Pulling the arrow from your quiver
3976600	3978600	and knocking it quickly along your bow,
3978600	3982600	you have a song in your heart as you let the fly that arrow.
3982600	3984600	It critically hits.
3986600	3987600	Excellent.
3987600	3989600	Adventure!
3989600	3991600	Fuck it!
3991600	3993600	Punching a wide hole in the heart.
3993600	3996600	You see it give a flailing about.
3996600	3999600	I can't even fucking talk. I'm leaving.
3999600	4001600	Punching a hole in the arrow.
4001600	4002600	Fuck!
4002600	4005600	The heart explodes in a violent explosion.
4005600	4007600	Gobbits and blood fly everywhere
4007600	4010600	and you hear the beast give a final shudder.
4010600	4013600	You feel yourself falling, falling, falling
4013600	4016600	as if the beast you're inside is crashing, crashing, crashing
4016600	4018600	to the ground and it impacts the earth.
4018600	4019600	How unsanitary.
4019600	4021600	With a violent shot.
4021600	4024600	Can everyone get into my portable hole
4024600	4026600	so that if it crashes we don't get hurt?
4026600	4028600	That seems like a really good idea.
4028600	4030600	Everyone get in my portable hole.
4030600	4032600	That's what she said.
4038600	4040600	Hiding inside the portable hole,
4040600	4043600	you take cover for what seems to be an eternity.
4043600	4044600	Soon you'll be out of air.
4044600	4046600	Oh, it's not so bad.
4046600	4049600	Steady, steady, telling all.
4049600	4051600	Your heads are swimming at the collective.
4051600	4054600	Found a peanut, found a peanut.
4055600	4057600	It makes the time pass.
4057600	4060600	Easy, boy. Easy.
4061600	4063600	Hate it anyway.
4063600	4065600	Hate it anyway.
4068600	4070600	I'm just gonna describe...
4070600	4072600	Okay. Okay.
4072600	4074600	After what seems like an eternity,
4074600	4076600	your heads are beginning to swim.
4076600	4078600	The air supply at the portable hole
4078600	4080600	is beginning to lessen and you feel yourselves
4080600	4082600	get slightly dizzy.
4082600	4086600	Perhaps unicorn farts aren't so helpful to breathing.
4086600	4089600	I open the portable hole.
4089600	4091600	Opening the portable hole,
4091600	4094600	you see what you haven't seen in a very long time.
4094600	4096600	The blue rays of the daylight.
4099600	4101600	Teamwork!
4101600	4103600	Spencer, everybody.
4103600	4105600	Spencer.
4106600	4108600	Night clips.
4108600	4110600	Steve Agee.
4111600	4113600	Aaron McGathey.
4113600	4115600	Thank you, sir.
4117600	4120600	Your gym teachers were wrong.
4120600	4123600	That's a way to spend an evening.
4131600	4133600	Did I dream it or was Greg Proves up here for a while?
4133600	4135600	He came up.
4135600	4137600	He came up.
4138600	4140600	I'm afraid when we hear the recording,
4140600	4142600	there's times when I'm screaming into this thing
4142600	4144600	because I don't hear myself and then I'm worried it's gonna be clipping.
4144600	4146600	I think they can hear us out there.
4146600	4148600	I think they're dealing with it back there.
4148600	4150600	Can you guys hear us?
4150600	4153600	Has there ever been a point where you couldn't hear me?
4153600	4155600	Okay.
4155600	4157600	Do you owe me five dollars?
4157600	4159600	Mixed results.
4161600	4164600	Depends if you were comped or not.
4164600	4169600	Jesus Jeff, how do we give the people of San Francisco a little bit back?
4169600	4171600	It seems like we've taken from them all night.
4171600	4173600	We've taken their love, we've taken their support.
4173600	4175600	I'm recording images of them.
4175600	4178600	Free t-shirts. Everybody gets a free t-shirt, right?
4178600	4180600	Really?
4180600	4183600	Well, certainly we could give away a lot of free t-shirts.
4183600	4185600	Chicken noodle dick?
4185600	4187600	Chicken noodle dick song. We can do that.
4187600	4189600	Do you know it?
4189600	4192600	Can we get all the women on stage that know chicken noodle dick on stage?
4192600	4195600	If you're a gal and you know the words of chicken noodle dick,
4195600	4197600	could you come on stage right now?
4197600	4199600	A little bit?
4199600	4202600	Get up here. Just you.
4202600	4204600	What's your name?
4204600	4206600	Martha.
4206600	4208600	Martha's the one that gave us the big cookie.
4208600	4210600	One more.
4210600	4212600	And you are?
4212600	4213600	Charlotte.
4213600	4215600	Martha and Charlotte.
4215600	4219600	If we let you start, how far could you get with chicken noodle dick?
4219600	4221600	All right, here we go. Ready?
4221600	4224600	Doo, doo, doo, doo.
4224600	4226600	Here I am.
4226600	4228600	Oh, sorry. No, it could be mostly like...
4228600	4229600	Keep going.
4229600	4230600	Keep going.
4230600	4232600	One, two, a one, two, three, four.
4232600	4234600	Here I am.
4234600	4237600	I ain't got a dick, got a chicken noodle can.
4237600	4242600	All my life, been working for a man with a chicken noodle wife.
4242600	4244600	Chicken noodles can come down the mountain.
4244600	4247600	Chicken noodle man got to work all day.
4247600	4249600	Chicken noodle man got to cross into the jungle.
4249600	4252600	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
4252600	4255600	Chicken to the bowl, bowl to the spoon.
4255600	4257600	Doo, doo, doo, doo.
4260600	4262600	All right, Jeff. It's not the way to end a show.
4262600	4264600	I'm sorry.
4264600	4267600	We should know better by now.
4267600	4269600	Wait, all my life.
4269600	4271600	Is that magic?
4271600	4274600	I was going to make a song book, but I forgot.
4275600	4278600	Looks like a bag of free t-shirts.
4280600	4282600	No, really?
4286600	4289600	I see a sea of hands
4289600	4292600	Across this bay and land
4292600	4296600	Reaching out for harm in town
4299600	4302600	I got a big black tee
4303600	4305600	Size 2XL
4308600	4310600	Very honest of you
4310600	4312600	Bill
4312600	4314600	Armantown
4314600	4316600	Armantown
4316600	4319600	The P is yellow and the B is brown
4319600	4321600	Who else is fat? 2XL
4321600	4322600	2XL
4322600	4324600	I'm not telling you
4327600	4329600	I fucked your mama so hard
4329600	4331600	A hoodie
4331600	4333600	I got a size large
4333600	4335600	2XL actually
4335600	4338600	Let's burn some of these fat ones out there
4341600	4345600	These trash bags can't fill the amount of love I have for you
4347600	4350600	I got a tiny itty bitty little small one
4350600	4352600	For some...
4352600	4353600	No, no, no
4353600	4354600	Where's the...
4354600	4356600	All right, it's got to be for a girl
4356600	4358600	Don't fight over it
4358600	4360600	Is this going to be the whole thing?
4360600	4362600	I have no idea
4362600	4364600	Someone else throw them
4364600	4366600	My job should be...
4366600	4368600	I'm the only one that could...
4368600	4374600	Spencer and Charlotte and Martha
4377600	4379600	Den
4379600	4381600	Work the room
4381600	4383600	Get out there
4384600	4387600	Whoa
4387600	4390600	Whoa
4390600	4392600	Armantown
4392600	4395600	I dropped my pants and pooped it down
4395600	4398600	San Francisco is the place to be
4398600	4401600	It's a cultural epicenter for me
4401600	4406600	It's okay to be gay and free when you're here
4406600	4409600	So drink some booze and beer
4409600	4412600	And go to the bay
4412600	4415600	And have a delicious beignet
4416600	4418600	Sorry lady, sorry
4420600	4423600	I whipped a woman in the head in Armantown
4433600	4435600	Pants are off
