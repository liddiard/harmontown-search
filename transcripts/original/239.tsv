0	29880	This session of Harlan Town is about to begin, first let me bring out the wonderful Spencer
29880	41600	Christenden. You can be louder than that. Yeah! Tonight in the room of Jeff Davis, who
41600	50760	we love so much, my name is Brandon Johnson, I will be your controller. And with no further
50760	55840	ado, let me bring out the mayor of Harlan Town, Dan Harmon!
59880	78920	Brandon Johnson, thank you Chicago! God bless you! God bless this fucking wonderful industrial
78920	89560	Midwestern, deprived, depressed city! God bless the alcohol coursing through your arteries
89560	97520	for generations that you can't even control! You Midwestern Visigoths! You are my people!
97520	105120	I grew up 90 minutes from you! I'm afraid to go back to my hometown so this is as close
105120	110760	as we'll ever get. I don't know how they'd react to me if everyone went back to Milwaukee.
110760	116240	I'm still scared. When I left, they said, you'll be back. That's not a good goodbye.
116240	120040	That's not something you say to people you love. I don't care how proud you are of your
120040	123280	hometown. You don't say you'll be back when someone says goodbye. They didn't say that
123280	130160	to Frodo. They said, I hope you save the world from Sauron. Why are you looking at me when
130160	141960	you say that? That's fucked up. Spencer Crittenden, everybody. The man who grew up in California
141960	148040	but looks more at home here than anyone. Oh yeah. I was walking around and I was like,
148040	153160	I'm the most comfortable person in this city right now. Still rocking the cargo shorts
153160	160920	today. Yeah, man. The weather was fine today for a nice stroll. Yeah, it gets fucking cold
160920	168880	in this area of the country. There is an oppressive spiritual thing that no one talks about. The
168920	178080	idea when you look up at the sky, you don't see God the way that you do in an equatorial climate.
178080	184880	You see blue and yellow and you feel like God's up there and he's somehow in charge of what
184880	189480	happens to you. It might be a good thing. It might be a bad thing. You might be part of some
189480	194520	agricultural community where they play lacrosse and the winner loses their head. Yeah, you do see
194520	201000	guys name Jesus, but they're usually pissing outside. But when you're in the Midwest, it's
201000	206680	like I've said it a thousand times, you're descended from the genes of people who like
206680	213440	they're descended from Plymouth Rock either landed on them or they landed on it. They didn't cross
213440	220520	the border, the border crossed them. In any case, they headed west, their wagon broke down, admit
220520	228360	it. And then they were like, fuck it. But that's not a non heroic thing to say. It's because guess
228360	233160	what? Like, like, well, what's waiting for you at the Pacific Ocean? Like, you're not like, well,
233160	238080	we just got out there. We I'm in Milwaukee. And I'm just saying the people the people on the west
238080	242120	coast, like, those are just the people that got that far. And then they're like, we have no more
242120	249120	dreams to chase. Let's invent television. In the Midwest is the gene pool that was like, you know,
249120	255760	what what if you just what if it was just cold? What if God tried to kill you? What if nine months
255760	262880	of the year God was unapologetic about his desire for you to die? What if what if what if every
262880	268160	everything you ate just like tried to poison you? What if every time you stepped outside? What if
268160	274960	the weatherman had to tell you how many seconds it took for human skin to freeze? What if your car
275120	283920	required not only a key to start, but a fucking chisel and a heated blanket and a schedule,
283920	288880	a regimen. I remember working in Milwaukee, you'd have to go out you schedule. It's like you'd
288880	295120	backtrack it like, oh, I got to be at the ground round at eight. So that means at seven, I got to
295120	301360	put a blanket on my car. I got to start the car. I'm not I'm not made for this. I'm a ground round
301440	306160	employee. And then the people that are coming in are going to pay what they weigh.
309760	314640	Which in Milwaukee is a lot of fucking money. So I'm going to be rich, I guess. Yeah, exactly. All
314640	321760	right. Anyways, but I hope but yeah, I got Midwestern chops. I'm not some. I'm not some hoity-toity.
321760	325760	You Google me. Oh, what's Dan Harmon worth? There's that page that says five million. I don't know
325760	330160	what the fuck that they're coming from. I don't know what that means. I'm not worth five million
330160	337760	dollars. I have a five bedroom house. Those bedrooms are not. We lost Brandon. We lost Brandon.
340000	346320	Those bedrooms are not worth a million dollars each. You know, I've eked out a comfortable
346320	350880	existence. I'm terrified right now. I feel like we're fighting a fascist empire. Whatever your
350880	355760	politics are fine here. It's fine. Chicago. I don't care. I saw the I saw the map. I saw how
355760	365440	red you were. It's okay. You're booing. You're saying you're saying blue. Okay, then you're
365440	368720	fine here too. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There's a couple of people in here that
368720	372800	voted for Trump. They're they're they're doing a good job. They're being polite. Chicago was
372800	377120	like the only city that like went in and wrecked up the place when Trump was around, you know?
381440	384880	What does he mean? What are you talking about? What do you mean? They came like he went and
384960	389280	stumping around all these places. But in Chicago, they shut it down. He wouldn't come outside.
389280	396480	Oh, he wouldn't come out here. All right. Resist. Fine. As long as I know I'm safe. I'll say
396480	403760	whatever. Look, let's burn it down. I just needed to know I was safe. I'm part of the spineless
403760	408880	demographic. I just don't want people to beat me up. That's all the reason why I'm part of the
408880	413440	resistance now is that has nothing to do. The reason I became politically activated to the extent
413760	420240	meaning that I tweet mean things now. It's because I'm lazy because all of a sudden it didn't now.
420240	424560	Now it's going to matter. I don't want I worked really hard to get my house. I don't want to have
424560	430640	to stand in front of it and like swing a bat and go like get away. Okay, it won't work. I won't. I
430640	436160	don't know what I'm made of. So I bought a gun and I just like I'm just I'm just sweating it out.
436160	439920	I'm just sweating it out in my house. But anyways, it doesn't matter. This is it's not about me.
444000	449840	It's about me. It's about me. But but you expect to show you want to show you came to a Chicago.
453280	458000	Then Dan, I don't I don't think I want to show I I can't I can't hear them. Do they want to show
458000	467040	I can't hear it. Okay, okay. You guys think just because we came to Chicago, we're gonna like
467120	470800	improvise. Is that the idea? Because you're famous for improv.
472400	476080	Please welcome improv maestro Jimmy Corrain.
482080	485920	And star of stage and screen Scott Anson.
485920	501600	All right, take it easy. All right, noted.
506720	513040	I'm better than season three. Yeah. Dan, by the way, yeah, Rick and Morty started airing tonight,
513040	518160	part of an elaborate, strange misguided April Fool's prank. I don't really understand it.
519440	524720	Rick and I can finally tell you Rick and Morty season three's premiere is airing on a loop.
524720	527360	When you go home, you can watch it. It's you're not missing anything.
529440	537120	It was it's it's a prank get it. I don't I don't get it. But I couldn't tell you and you kept you
537200	543840	fucking 15 year olds kept riding me. I'd be like, Trump's an idiot. He's gonna he's a fascist. We're
543840	550240	gonna lose our civil liberties. Yeah, well, you're gonna lose season three of big good morning.
551520	557440	I'm not doing any I'm finished. They're drawing it. Yeah. Prove it.
557440	568320	Exactly, sir. I mean, like anyone was going to hear that. I mean, he could have said anything.
569840	574800	Now so the ricks out. You sound like a he's not like a Star Wars character.
576880	580480	Like, I liked him yelling out. I think that was helpful. But I didn't hear what you said.
580480	582160	Would you come down here and say it into my mic?
582720	587520	Well, people will take that invitation. Yeah. Okay.
589600	593920	We'll vamp until you get here. All right. So you guys are improvisational professionals.
596000	601280	See, people are cheering because now nine dudes are pretending to be him. And they're all there's
601280	605520	gonna be a line of people coming up. I was that guy sneaks, not got bricks out.
605520	613600	I was a guy came for sample. You guys all have an improv background. Yeah,
613600	619680	Brandon Johnson. You did improv. I did improv. I did not do improv as well as these two fucking
619680	626560	gods we have on stage in front of you. Wrong. Thank you. Wrong. No, wrong. Did you work with
626560	630320	Brandon? We improvised a few times like in sets and stuff. We weren't the same generation.
630560	633840	And that was your understudy. So you never missed a day of work.
636000	641200	But a lot of people might be coming because there's 900 people here. There's 900 people here.
643360	649680	They may only be here because they know that I'm amazing. They, some of them, even though they're
649680	654640	from Chicago, may not know what improv really is. They may think it's just, well, oh, that's when
654720	660320	you don't have a script. Let's just, on a molecular level, we'll just show them for,
660320	675280	like, what improv is on a fundamental level. Okay. So I will, let's tell a story in
675920	685440	four lines of dialogue. I will enter with a line. Then we have two more lines to do.
686400	692320	And then, Brandon, you come in with the fourth line. Oh, great. Great. So, no pressure. No
692320	696320	pressure. Who we are and what we're doing and where we are. And we'll get as much information
696320	700160	as we can because that's part of improv. It's like being positive and providing information,
700240	705040	piping and things. Yes. So four lines. Here's how improv works.
713360	719600	I would like to return this fur coat because it's too big.
721200	723840	But I'm a ghost. I can't run the cash register.
730880	736800	I am the manager, and I can help you, sir.
743120	747120	He said he wanted a 15-dog coat, so I made him a 15-dog coat.
752160	759920	All right. Thank you. Thank you. So that's the atomic structure of improv.
760560	763440	I don't think we have to explain it. I think it's pretty self-explanatory.
764640	768880	What its merits are. In that, I was the Steve Harvey character.
768880	774880	Yeah. Now, I want to say, and then people go like, oh, so improv, like, oh, they compare it to like
774880	779760	written comedy. So let me, so there's a laptop back here. Let me, this is going to be tough,
779760	782800	and it's going to run. It's going to run the risk of making a bad show. Yeah, hold it.
782800	789360	Okay. All right. Yeah. So, okay. So if we were to write that scene.
795600	804240	There it is. I don't know. Okay. The next day, interior coat shop.
806240	809120	For a second, I thought that was the guy from upstairs, and I was like, get the fuck out of
809120	820400	here. I'll kick you in your face. You look like Steve Bannon. Oh, yeasty and shit. That dude has
820400	825440	a yeast. He's got some yeast shit on his face. That's the good thing about not liking that dude
825440	829040	is we can talk shit on him, and nobody's going to be like, don't be like that about Steve Bannon.
830800	836480	Fucking brought Steve Bannon to the party, you guys. Be nice tonight. He's got on a diaper.
839120	853280	Oh, shit. It wants to save the god damn it. Esports. Fucking bullshit. Some YouTube show
853280	857840	we're doing. All right. Tim Buck says the first thing that came up was the porn from last night
857840	865600	on that laptop. Ghost, ghost coat. We'll call it. There's a lot of mannequin-like porn on his
865600	876160	computer right now. How to make a ghost costume. And then the manager. What did you say, Jimmy?
876160	885360	You said I was the manager. I can help you. And then Brandon disembodied.
887120	891040	I played a young Nigerian trying to find his way through the furry industry.
891920	900560	I sold him a coat for $15. Okay, so we have a flawed story here that we created improvisationally.
900560	903680	Like, where did it break down? I thought my line was awesome.
906800	911600	Like, and then you introducing the fact that you're a ghost brought us across a threshold.
911600	914720	Right. I was introducing a mythology that we could explore.
914720	918640	I think and then it starts to break down, ironically, with our improv masters, Jimmy Carain.
919520	924720	Jimmy Carain, who teaches improv, was like, I'm a manager. I can help you.
926240	931680	But ironically, you couldn't. No, no. As an improv manager, you couldn't help anyone.
931680	935200	I couldn't, no. Yeah. Although he could have made his line longer.
936240	941040	You just said line. Yeah, he could have. Yeah. So let's try it again. Let's do a rewrite.
941040	947440	Okay. That's not how improv works, Mayor Harmon. But I'm not going to change what I did because
947520	952720	I nailed it. Okay. And I don't think Scott did very bad either.
955360	958720	Now I feel a lot of pressure. Can I just say before we do that, I'm feeling a lot of
958720	963040	pressure. I'm in my head right now. I'm going to alter my line just a little bit. It may help you.
963040	965840	Okay. All right. You're going to set me up. Thank you, Scott. And also,
965840	969840	if you were more relaxed before, that may have been the problem. Okay.
969840	980320	Okay. I'd like to return this coat. It doesn't fit me very well. I'm a ghost, remember?
987120	989680	I'm a ghost too. I'm the manager ghost.
989680	1002560	I think I'm catching on. What do you think? Are you still in character? I can't respond if
1002560	1011040	you are. No. We'll talk later. Why is that lady wearing a fur coat on the beach?
1011040	1018640	Whoa. Okay. I mean, that was interesting because that changed everything.
1018640	1021360	I just thought I'd try something different for this improv.
1022640	1025200	So the actors thought they knew where they were,
1025200	1028480	but then the dialogue shows that we were actually on a beach with a door.
1032000	1035040	Now the interesting thing is the characters knew that the actors didn't.
1035040	1039920	That's right. Like all good improv, alcoholism together, all rooted in denial.
1041760	1046320	You say plane, I say boat. So if we were to continue with that scene,
1047360	1051040	so he's now revealed that we're on a beach with a door and that we have two ghosts,
1051040	1058240	but I'm returning a coat that doesn't fit. And you're a lady.
1058240	1070000	You, you promised me when I rubbed that seashell
1072560	1078160	that if I wore your coat, you'd give me lightning power.
1082240	1084240	The lightning power has always been in you.
1084240	1094000	The coat was just a catalyst to your realization. Use your power now.
1096560	1102080	I'm still the manager ghost. And with your power, you can kill me.
1102080	1117680	Wait a minute, Andy, when you get out of prison, you can help me work on the boat. Shawshank.
1123840	1129520	All right. Well, okay. So all right. So there's a, I like that one.
1129520	1134560	So what we're learning about improv is that it's different from writing.
1134560	1140400	Like if you held it to the same standards, it wouldn't hold up. Like a lot of people watch,
1140400	1144160	like whose line is it anyway? And they go like, well, why don't you just write that stuff? And
1144160	1149680	then, but then you go like, no, they're making it up. You go to like a, like an improv show in
1149680	1154880	Chicago, like a long form improv show by really talented, like long form improv people. And you
1154880	1158320	could witness something that could never be written. It could never be written. Jimmy,
1158320	1163920	what is that phenomenon? What is that magic? Well, I think it's because each show was always
1163920	1168960	different every night. Sometimes you're, they're going to fail and sometimes they're going to
1168960	1175360	succeed. It's really like a sporting event. That's what makes it so fun to watch. What do you think,
1175360	1185200	Scott? I hate sports metaphors. Okay. Especially in relation to art, but I'll say that the difference
1185200	1189200	I think is that when somebody's written and people know it's written, then they have a higher
1189200	1198160	expectation for it being crafted and satisfying and an improv survival is a win. And people in
1198160	1202960	the audience know that they know that, that everyone's on a tightrope and if they, if they
1202960	1207920	land gracefully, then that's a success. And the highest compliment you can get in an improv show
1207920	1213280	is people will come and say, I, are you sure that wasn't scripted? You know, that's like the highest
1213280	1218320	compliment you can get. But that would mean that you did so good at improv that it was just slightly
1218320	1224240	less like good than something that was right. Well, there are terrible suggestions. There's something
1224240	1229280	that people should be coming up to you and saying, I know for sure that wasn't written, but it was
1229280	1234080	better than anything that could have been written. We both heard that. Yeah. Right. Who are these
1234080	1239280	people you get into a fight with Dan? But we're just saying like the audience, they're dumb. They
1239280	1243760	don't have that vocabulary. They're like, they're just like, oh, that seemed like written it. And
1243760	1249680	it was like, okay, yeah, give me your 10 bucks. Okay. Spencer, you're very cynical about improv.
1249680	1255360	No, I'm cynical about America. Okay. I'm sorry. I confused it. Spencer, where does it. So when
1255360	1260400	you're a dungeon master, where does this come in? Because you're, you're improvising as a narrator
1260400	1263920	and then people are looking at a sheet of paper and they're saying, well, then because of this
1263920	1269680	sheet of paper, which isn't a script, but it is a bunch of facts, I do this. And then like, what,
1271280	1278480	talk, say some stuff. Oh, it is like writing and improv. So what if,
1282720	1288960	I just, yeah, it's so easy. It's so easy with these guys say, okay, Jimmy Corrine,
1288960	1295360	improv extraordinaire would be your dice because you don't have any, and we don't have a campaign.
1295360	1303280	So then could you dungeon master, uh, an improvised campaign for me and Scott and Brandon
1304080	1310560	to be in a little campaign? And then Jimmy is like the, the dice. Could Jimmy improvise
1311520	1319920	results? Um, so many clues. Yeah. I don't, can you improvise results? Does that sound fun to you?
1322800	1327040	I, I, whatever, whatever anyone wants. Yes.
1331200	1336320	It's kind of like if, if Jimmy was human dice, like if you were, if you just like,
1336320	1342320	anytime, uh, we wanted to do something, Spencer would look at you and then you would
1343920	1350400	represent a random result and then Spencer would read it and then explain to us what we had
1350400	1358720	accomplished. Now to connect the dots backstage, me and Dan were thinking that a true improv master
1358720	1362880	would be able to improvise perfectly the random results as if from a die.
1367200	1372240	That's part of this almost like a magician. Right. Do you mean that? Yeah. What do you
1373040	1380400	know? I've just, you said that. Do you mean like Jimmy would say three and eight or do you mean
1380400	1385440	like Jimmy would be like, you hit and you get a critical hit? Let's ask the person who said that
1386160	1390640	what you, I didn't suggest. Yeah. I didn't, I didn't say, Hey, Jimmy would be great at pretending
1390720	1397760	to be dice. But like, I don't, I believe you when you say it, but I don't know your thinking.
1397760	1403360	Why are you listening to me about anything? I think you were, I was sitting down and you
1403360	1410560	looked taller. So I'll control everything. Well, you could do, you control what you want me to
1410560	1417520	control. Okay. That's what I'm going to do. All right, Spencer, you're in charge of, of, of, of
1417520	1428160	what, what happens? Okay. What we're seeing and, and what's in the room. Okay. And then whenever
1428160	1434480	anyone wants to do anything, instead of rolling dice, Jimmy, who's not part of the narrative,
1434480	1439200	Jimmy, you're like a non-diegetic element. That is not a word.
1439200	1451280	Uh, you non-diegetic, you produce results. You're sort of like a God or a, or I mean,
1451280	1455760	it wouldn't, it wouldn't be fun for him to say random numbers. Jimmy, you have to do more than
1455760	1460960	that. You have to, you have to represent a kind of like, uh, dice. You have to,
1462240	1465680	you have to indicate fate in a way that Spencer can read.
1469680	1476000	So you stand over there. Can you give me an example? Yes. Give me an example. Okay. All
1476000	1482560	right. Well, you beat me, you beat me. I'm Dan. Do you know how to play dungeon and drag?
1483920	1488320	You tell him what he's looking at. Okay. Jimmy, you're in a wonderful field,
1488320	1494000	but it's surrounded by trees. Maybe it's a forest even. What do you do? So tell him what you want
1494000	1503440	to do. Uh, I'd like to climb up one of the trees. Oh shit. That's him rolling. Are you rolling?
1503440	1511200	It's a very sexy tree. You have to interpret it. Wait, what? Because like, I'm a human die. Like,
1511200	1517040	I'm a, like, I'm not going to just say, I'm, I'm just saying like, like, this could mean to you,
1517040	1522720	it's like a tarot card. It could mean like, it's like, oh, that seems like a normal average thing.
1522720	1526560	He's acquiescent. So if he says he wants to climb a tree and I'm going like this,
1526560	1533600	I guess he climbs the tree maybe. Well, I thought you're right. Then it's like he felt, oh, a twig
1533600	1538400	poked him in the eye and he fell out of the tree because I'm being like aggressive. Now, Dan, were
1538400	1544560	you the tree? No, no, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like a human. What are you? I'm a human die. I'm a human
1544560	1550080	die. Well, a human die would tumble around and reveal a face with a number of side, like a number
1550080	1558080	on it. That's, that's if a human was a die, right? Yeah, a human die, the role of a die. A human
1558080	1565440	wouldn't have to say three or eight. A human could use all their human faces and behaviors to indicate
1565440	1573840	the vibe. So like, like, like, if a person was just like, you know, like, if you were just like,
1574000	1582880	you know, like you, it's clearly a two, that might mean an extreme result. But well, yeah,
1582880	1587920	isn't a result of the dice, a number? Oh, okay. I got it. I got it. No, if it's a human die,
1588640	1592960	you got to say the number, the dice. Okay. So you got to say how many sides are on the die.
1592960	1597920	So like, if you say this is a 20 sided die, then it's like, oh, is that a 17 out of 20? Or is that
1597920	1602160	like, you know, it's got to be like that. No, why wouldn't they just say seven? They would just say
1603040	1606960	a number then. Because it's like, what are you trying to roll? Are you trying to roll a very high
1606960	1609840	roll of a six sided die? Or are you trying to get a saying that the person's
1612160	1619840	I think it's more like a dreidel. Because he's, he's rolling and becoming a symbol for something
1619840	1625840	rather than a number of quantifying something. And he wants you to interpret it as the next action
1625840	1629760	and how successful it is based on the emotion you're getting from his action. Okay.
1632720	1640640	I told you, I told you these is gods. Okay, so Jimmy, okay, so I was climbing the tree.
1640640	1644880	You guys be the you guys be the adventurers. I'm obviously I'll be the die. Okay.
1648720	1652720	But it's like, and don't be distracted by the fact that I'm just gonna like feel the vibe. Okay,
1652720	1656720	no, like I'm not. Another thing about a die is that it's like, it's like this punctuated thing
1656720	1661680	where it's like, Oh, now we roll it. Now we get a number. No, I'm over here. I'm not part of your
1661680	1667360	narrative. But Spencer's got one eye on me mentally. And I'm just sort of like, feeling things. Okay.
1668160	1673200	And then sort of like, like, like, and then like, how do we quantify a role? Then it sounds like
1673200	1679360	you're in a continuous rolling. You're not quantifying. But, but so I look at you, I just
1679360	1685120	take a snapshot and go, yes, this frame of Dan's existence. Yeah, I would say that's accurate.
1685120	1690960	Well, then when do I decide when I should throw to you? Like, that's your own decision. Well,
1691120	1697360	that's like taking a cup and dipping it in a river, like, like the river that could be so like,
1697360	1700720	when do you do it? And how big is the cup? And it's like, it's up to you. It's like,
1700720	1706480	that's what dice are supposed to, like, I thought I would be the most on board for this.
1708320	1715520	I thought you are crafting, you are crafting a new paradigm. I'm already doing it. He's crafted
1715520	1718720	it. No, no, but you're a big part of it. I mean, I really think we're sitting on a gold mine. I'm
1718720	1725760	already doing it. No, this is great. I'm already doing it. Okay, we have to go on the adventure.
1725760	1733520	Yeah, we're on a journey. And I would like to be Gwynethor, the golem fairy princess. Okay,
1733520	1736720	can I still be the manager, the ghost manager? Okay.
1741040	1747520	Gwynethor. Yeah, Gwynethor and ghost manager, you find yourself in Bristol bees,
1747520	1755600	the merry town of bristles and bees. Around you, you see bristles and bees winding their
1755600	1761280	merry ways through the city of Bristol bees. I don't know what it's called anymore. Brizzled bees.
1768080	1771440	At your feet, you can see the tiny dwellings of the bees
1772240	1775440	and the slightly larger dwellings of the bristles.
1778080	1785200	We must be careful where we stop. Okay, we will talk, we will walk very gently.
1790080	1793200	You got me.
1801840	1808080	You don't, you don't step on any more bees than those ones that just earlier made noise.
1809520	1814080	You find yourself to what seems like the town hall of Bristol bees.
1814080	1816560	No repercussions for killing townspeople. Yes.
1819200	1822640	There is the tiny town hall there. Let's go in. Yes.
1823840	1828880	You open the door and out comes the mayor. He's a little bee. He's got a, he looks like the
1828960	1831200	honey nut Cheerios bee, but like with a mustache.
1837680	1843040	Welcome to our town. Go be the, go be the guy. You don't have to stand back there.
1844160	1846000	You want this mic? Thanks so much.
1848000	1855760	Hello, little bee. Welcome to our town. I am Gwynethor, the Gollum princess, and this is my manager.
1859840	1864000	We have waited for your arrival. We've heard so much about you.
1865120	1870640	Welcome to Bizzlebee. Um, you've killed about a thousand of our residents.
1872320	1875600	Sorry about that. It's okay. We're just happy to see you.
1877760	1883760	We, we realized as soon as we came to town that nothing random really happens here ever, does it?
1884560	1890800	Nope. Monday looks like Friday. Friday looks like Saturday. You get it.
1891440	1897120	You smell the smell of sweet lemons. It's weird because lemons smell sour usually.
1897840	1901760	And at the same time, you feel everything expanding and growing,
1901760	1906400	including yourselves in the buildings around you. Oh my God, the scale remains.
1907920	1912240	You can't, it looks about the same because everything grows at roughly the same size,
1912240	1916960	but you're clearly larger than you were. So I'd be about this tall.
1918320	1923440	No, you grow more. You grow more. It's a weird occurrence. Great. Yeah.
1925520	1928720	Allow me to show you around our beautiful town. That would be great.
1929520	1933840	That's the library. Oh, that's the other library.
1943040	1944880	I'm not sure how I feel about it yet.
1947680	1954000	You feel conflicted. Come. Which library should I go to? I'll go to the, no, I'll go to,
1954560	1962560	no, I'll go to this, this one. No, I'll go to this one. No. Well, that library, boring.
1963120	1969760	This library contains books that will lead you into the arms of our mascot.
1969760	1982800	Oh, the Tai Chi master. Or maybe I think he wants to be left alone. He dates to be misnamed.
1982800	1986560	He's been doing things all by himself without anyone talking to him or acknowledging his
1986560	1998000	existence. You guys are being literal and you're. Maybe you'd like to meet the soul of our town.
1998960	2003360	I think he's meant to be separate from us. Yes. He's not part of the narrative.
2003360	2008560	Okay. Spencer, I'll do, I'll do, you do my part. I'll do your part. Well, okay. Let's trade. Let's
2008560	2020320	just trade. Okay. Okay. I'm not saying I'm going to do better. I'm just saying like, I, obviously,
2020320	2024800	I owe it to people to demonstrate what I mean. It's like, like you guys don't worry about him.
2024960	2032240	You're just people. You exist in your own narrative. Don't worry about him. That's fucked up.
2033760	2037040	I'll worry about him. Sorry we let you down, Dan.
2039840	2042640	Spencer, where are they? They're in a tree trunk. Where are they?
2042640	2045440	Dan, we were really feeling sorry for you. Yeah, we did. Yeah, man.
2046480	2052560	We're trying to execute your fucking vision. We were, we were feeling bad for you, Dan.
2052560	2056800	No, don't feel sorry. No, you were out there all alone and look kind of ridiculous.
2057920	2062720	It didn't seem like you were generating, generating anything and inspiring any new
2062720	2067600	directions. We want to please you, Dan. You're trying to construct a meta improv narrative.
2068480	2072960	No, that was, no, that was your idea, Dan. We were just trying to support it.
2072960	2078880	You give gifts with all these crazy body movements, you showing your body and everything. And we
2078880	2083840	wanted to accept those gifts and heighten. And right now we're playing a game where the
2083840	2086800	scene has broken down and we are playing our personas. Yeah.
2089040	2093120	Well, what if my character decides that because you're disappointing me,
2093120	2098640	I will go back in time? Well, why don't we see what that would look like?
2098640	2104000	Cut to a great Chicago phrase. Cut to.
2115760	2126800	You guys are adventuring in a big field. You're a fighter and a wizard.
2126800	2132800	I'm a fighter. Great. Jimmy Carranes, you are Jimmy Carranes, the great fighter.
2132800	2139440	Yes, I'm Jimmy Carranes, the great fighter. You have a plate armor and a hat and a sword.
2140560	2149600	Scott Atsett, you are at sort, at city, it's at Sodoros, the wizard of just suckdicula.
2149600	2157200	You love magic, but you don't mind sucking dick.
2161920	2174560	You got a bag of tricks that include sucking dick and some spells. And you guys are on a field,
2174560	2182560	in a field, a great field overlooking a town and you're on a quest to find a gold ring
2183200	2184720	that you heard might exist.
2189760	2191920	Pretty original. But there's some goblins.
2194160	2195600	There's some goblins coming.
2195600	2201760	It's so easy.
2201760	2202720	It's so easy.
2202720	2209760	There's goblins coming. And I'm basing that on his movement, but he's not the goblins.
2210560	2211280	You understand?
2212400	2215040	Why would we waste all that good movement, though?
2215760	2220800	But I'm looking at his movement, but it's not, god damn it, it's not that hard.
2221840	2224000	Don't acknowledge the dice. Goblins are coming.
2225600	2227760	Just don't acknowledge what Scott said, right?
2227760	2230800	The goblins are shooting. The goblins are shooting at you.
2231760	2232880	We're going to try to make sure.
2232880	2234800	You got hit real bad, Jimmy.
2236560	2238160	You got hit in the arm with an arrow.
2240160	2243680	Oh, Zephyr winds blow some cock.
2246160	2250320	You're waving your arms in a magical manner. You try to cast a healing spell on Jimmy
2250320	2254400	Crane's character, and it's doing okay. It's doing fine.
2256560	2258160	Not nearly as good as the dick's looking.
2258160	2259200	Don't use it for about three weeks.
2259200	2262320	Okay, great. It's feeling a little sore, but it's feeling a little better.
2263840	2266080	I don't have to suck your dick, do I, for that?
2266080	2268480	You don't have to, but I would really appreciate it.
2272160	2274000	More arrows are raining down in you.
2276320	2279760	But they're missing, generally, because the goblins are far away.
2279760	2281440	They're just taking potshots at you.
2282240	2284640	You guys, maybe there's a way we can stop the goblins.
2284640	2287280	Okay, I've got a sword. I forgot.
2288160	2289840	The goblins are on the move. They're coming.
2289840	2291280	I was trying to slay the goblin.
2292000	2295440	All right, I'm going to try a multiplying spell on your sword
2295440	2298720	and throw one sword that will land as a hundred.
2298720	2299280	All right.
2299280	2303440	Your multiplying spell fails.
2303440	2304160	All right, here it goes.
2305840	2307040	I'm sorry, I was distracted.
2307040	2307600	What was your name?
2308080	2310080	Your sword flies off into the grass.
2310880	2312400	The goblins are laughing at you.
2313840	2314800	That's not the goblins.
2314800	2316640	They're continuing to march towards you.
2317440	2319360	We got to stop them somehow or get out of here.
2319360	2319600	Okay.
2320480	2321280	Jimmy, you still...
2322720	2323600	No, you don't. Okay.
2325280	2327200	You're wearing armor? Why don't you just go fight them for us?
2327200	2327840	That's a great idea.
2329200	2332480	If I don't come back, I love you.
2334480	2334640	No.
2337600	2339520	That's an incentive if I come back.
2339520	2339840	All right.
2341040	2345360	Jimmy proceeds across the great plains of Dixiculae.
2347040	2350080	Oh, the goblins are terrified of something.
2351600	2355200	They're summoning healing powers to buff themselves,
2355200	2356960	to give themselves higher armor.
2358000	2361360	As you get towards them, you see them starting to glow bright red,
2361360	2363360	indicating that it's going to be harder to hit them.
2364320	2366720	Use the strategy I used at Awful Door.
2366800	2367600	All right.
2367600	2369280	Just go for their penises.
2369280	2369600	All right.
2370960	2374080	The goblins attack.
2374080	2374640	You attack.
2375280	2378000	Your attacks are not doing good.
2378000	2378480	All right.
2382320	2383520	The goblins are now...
2383520	2385120	They think they're a turn to attack.
2385120	2386080	They're doing real good.
2386080	2387440	They're real excited and they do...
2388080	2390800	And their arrows are piercing you for...
2393120	2393600	I'm down.
2394400	2395520	I've been hit by an arrow.
2396160	2400160	I'm going to approach a goblin and try to get it to surrender through pleasure.
2400160	2400640	Okay.
2405520	2407520	The goblins are considering your offer.
2407520	2408240	Is it working?
2411600	2412800	I think it's working.
2412800	2413920	They seem into it.
2416160	2418160	The goblins are down.
2418800	2419680	Keep going.
2419680	2420640	I see the ring.
2422320	2423600	I see the ring.
2423600	2425360	It's attached to what I'm using.
2425360	2427040	The goblins have an offer for you.
2427040	2431600	They say, if you continue to pleasure them, that they'll spare your lives.
2436240	2439920	One by one, the goblin's chodes go down your throat,
2441680	2443680	filling you with the goblin's seed.
2446240	2446880	No.
2446880	2447440	I'm pregnant.
2447440	2448080	No.
2448080	2448320	No.
2449520	2450480	They're different than us.
2451600	2452240	Oh my God.
2453120	2454640	I'm giving birth through my new retreat.
2454640	2454800	All right.
2454800	2455840	Hold it, hold it, hold it.
2458080	2458640	It's coming.
2460080	2460640	I got it.
2463040	2463840	A goblin.
2463840	2464800	A goblin baby.
2467040	2467440	All right.
2469360	2470800	A goblin baby came out.
2470800	2471680	It's a boy.
2471680	2472720	It's a baby boy.
2474880	2475520	All right.
2475520	2476000	Well, I...
2476720	2477520	All right.
2477520	2482000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2482000	2483360	At least I know he's mine.
2485360	2491760	Okay, I'm willing to admit this isn't working, if you guys are.
2491760	2492240	All right.
2492240	2492800	Okay, all right.
2492800	2493280	That was...
2493280	2494400	Okay, that's all I want.
2494400	2495680	Okay, Spencer, you can have me here.
2503440	2505280	And you're saying you couldn't write that.
2506320	2507440	Okay, now I get it.
2507440	2510080	Now I understand what he meant when he said, what do you mean?
2510800	2513280	Dan, I want to ask you what you learned from that.
2514240	2515280	That it doesn't work.
2515280	2518080	That you can't just come out on stage and make up a show.
2524080	2525760	I wanted to give you something.
2525760	2526720	I'm a Midwesterner.
2526720	2527920	You're a Midwesterner.
2527920	2530480	You've been very kind to me over the years.
2530480	2532400	And I wanted to get you a little gift.
2532400	2534000	This is big in Chicago.
2534000	2535120	It's Frango Mintz.
2536240	2537440	Frango Mintz.
2537440	2538000	Yeah.
2538000	2540880	Frango Mintz when you care to send Frango Mintz.
2540880	2541760	Thanks.
2541760	2542320	Thank you.
2542320	2547360	I didn't know, you know, usually people bring, you know, pizzas or...
2548560	2549040	What else?
2553280	2554480	Bone-in pork sandwich.
2554480	2554720	Yeah.
2555840	2556720	Polish sausage.
2556720	2561520	But in Chicago, Midwesterners, we like to bring something to the host of the party.
2562320	2562640	All right.
2565680	2567200	Well, I appreciate the gesture.
2567200	2567680	Thank you.
2567680	2569680	Did that improv exhaust you, Dan?
2569680	2571760	No, no, I'm just moving on.
2571760	2572000	Okay.
2573840	2575120	King of the Segway.
2576480	2578160	So what do we know about...
2578160	2582720	So as improvisers, like, we make things up.
2583280	2586320	We go, okay, so God is in the moment.
2587920	2590880	And everything that happened before and everything that's about to happen,
2590880	2591760	that's the devil.
2591760	2592720	He's going to fuck you up.
2593840	2595040	God is in the moment.
2595040	2596240	You guys are following me, right?
2596240	2596720	Totally.
2596720	2598240	Just like the last exercise.
2598240	2598740	Right.
2599460	2604900	So in politics, like, we have this right versus left paradigm.
2604900	2608340	So we can recognize Republicans, for instance, as being very out of the moment.
2608340	2611220	They're worried about what happened yesterday and what's about to happen.
2611220	2613140	Democrats, are they really in the moment?
2613140	2617140	Or are they just a mirror image of Republicans improvisationally speaking?
2617140	2622420	They're not really making it up as they go because they're politicians.
2622980	2626260	So don't we just need a revolution where everybody just, like,
2626260	2628180	rips off their clothes and runs in the street and goes like,
2628180	2630180	well, make it up, make it up as you go.
2630180	2631060	But here's...
2631060	2632020	And before you answer that,
2634660	2636900	aren't we doomed as a society?
2638420	2643540	Because, like, hasn't the height of what we've been able to adopt democracy?
2644180	2647940	And doesn't that by default mean mob rule?
2647940	2650900	And aren't most people stupid?
2650900	2654820	And then, like, so if you're smart and you're liberal,
2654820	2659140	then don't you have to either choose between consorting with a bunch of morons
2659140	2661380	who are like, yay, be liberal.
2661380	2662660	And you're like, yeah, but you're dumb.
2664340	2665540	And that's, like, kind of the...
2665540	2668820	I see, like, there's a division among the Democrats between, like, the...
2668820	2670820	You know, I don't want to put too fine a point on it,
2670820	2676020	but you got your Bernie people and your traditional Democrats and stuff.
2676020	2680020	And there's, like, a real heavy division between folks because they're like,
2680020	2682900	yeah, we don't want fucking more corruption and all this stuff.
2682980	2685220	And then it's like, like, yeah, but if you don't...
2685780	2686580	It's fucking...
2686580	2688100	Yeah, don't even get excited, sir.
2689540	2691220	Oh, there was moves!
2691220	2693460	It's just, like, you just feel like this is, like, wedge.
2693460	2697220	It's, like, right now it's, like, so fun watching the bad guys be in power
2697220	2699620	and watching them kind of fumble over themselves.
2699620	2703300	But then you feel this dark cloud in the horizon where it's, like, we're supposed to...
2703300	2706740	The next move is we're supposed to all agree on something and do something together.
2706740	2708100	And we can't get our shit together.
2708100	2710180	We're gonna start, like, arguing with each other really soon.
2710180	2711540	We're already doing it.
2711540	2712420	What was my point?
2712420	2714900	Like, how do we...
2714900	2715860	Isn't there a way to, like...
2718900	2720180	What are we gonna do?
2720180	2721540	Why shouldn't I just kill myself?
2722820	2723860	Nobody's stopping you.
2727700	2729220	Only you are stopping you.
2729860	2733620	Dan, if you did kill yourself, how would you do it?
2736020	2736420	I mean, I would...
2736420	2738020	Would it be in front of a large crowd?
2738020	2738260	Yeah.
2740660	2741460	At, like, a comedy festival?
2741460	2745540	I feel like I'd do a major podcast and keep talking about how I hadn't gotten my gun yet.
2746580	2748820	And then I'd announce that I had gotten my gun.
2750660	2751620	And I'd pick a...
2751620	2753300	I'd pick an obscure town.
2753300	2753780	Okay.
2753780	2754580	Give me an example.
2754580	2757380	A hard-working town, but I'd maximize the number of people.
2757380	2757620	Okay.
2757620	2758260	Blue state, red state.
2758260	2759940	I'd wanna push, like, a thousand people.
2759940	2760340	Okay.
2760340	2761620	Somewhere around my hometown.
2761620	2762020	Okay.
2762020	2765460	And then I'd just pull out a gun, just blow my brains out on...
2765460	2772580	No, I do feel like I'd blow my brains out, I think.
2772580	2773060	Okay.
2778420	2782260	Because I feel like pills, like, if you took, like, a bottle of Tylenol, you'd be like...
2783300	2785460	I feel like you'd be like, ow, my kidney.
2787060	2789220	And then you'd be like, ow, my kidney hurts.
2789220	2790260	I changed my mind.
2790260	2791220	I changed my mind.
2791220	2792820	I know killing myself hurts.
2792820	2795060	And then you'd be like, yeah, but your kidneys are shut down.
2795460	2796820	I think you mean your liver.
2797380	2797700	What?
2797700	2798340	I think you mean your liver.
2798340	2800180	Yes, we heard you liver, sir.
2800980	2801860	Liver.
2801860	2803060	Too many people talking over each other.
2803060	2805700	Everyone knows kidneys don't filter out a damn thing.
2807060	2807540	Okay.
2807540	2808100	Five people talking over each other.
2808100	2809140	I just wanna ask you this.
2809140	2810820	I wanna play to the audience on this one.
2810820	2814900	Really common here in Chicago is people will jump in front of the L to take their life.
2814900	2815300	Really?
2815300	2815620	Yeah.
2815620	2816660	Would you do something like that?
2816660	2817460	No, absolutely.
2817460	2818020	Why not?
2818020	2818500	No.
2818500	2820020	Too dramatic, too macho.
2821940	2823860	Too fucking, like, I don't know, just too...
2823860	2825540	So you wanna go out quietly with a gun.
2828660	2829780	I just don't think...
2832100	2834420	The thing about jumping in front of a train...
2834420	2834740	Right.
2834740	2835620	Too athletic.
2835620	2836260	That's what it is.
2836260	2836980	Okay.
2836980	2837700	I'll fuck it up.
2837700	2842100	I'll tell you what always pisses me off about it is the people that do it, do it during rush hour.
2842100	2842980	Right, yeah.
2842980	2844100	And that really inconveniences...
2844100	2845700	Just ruins everyone's day.
2845700	2846900	...why it's gonna do it at times where it's not gonna affect as many people.
2846900	2849700	That's the other thing is I don't wanna fuck other people's days up.
2849700	2850340	I don't wanna do that.
2850980	2853460	If I was gonna blow my brains up, by the way, I would also...
2853460	2855780	I would coat my bathroom in saran wrap.
2858180	2861220	And I would write the nicest note for my housekeeper.
2861220	2863700	I'd be like, I am so sorry.
2864740	2865700	Don't go upstairs.
2865700	2866740	Call 911.
2867540	2868980	There's a mess up there.
2868980	2874100	But you can just undo the masking tape and just seal it all up.
2874100	2877140	Put me in the blue bin and just be done with it.
2877140	2878820	So you don't wanna throw anyone off?
2878900	2880580	Here's a box of toys for your kid.
2880580	2883060	You don't want anyone inconvenienced or distracted by your death?
2883060	2883860	No, I would not wanna...
2883860	2885380	Does that include your family?
2885380	2886180	Of course, yeah.
2886180	2889300	Okay, well see, I think the absence of you and the fact that you feel
2889300	2892500	such a failure that they would feel that maybe they failed you and they would...
2892500	2895700	I wish I could bring any of my family out right now and prove you so wrong.
2896980	2898420	No, I don't think any of them would be...
2898420	2899060	They wouldn't care.
2899060	2900180	They wouldn't care.
2900180	2902740	No, they'd be like, oh, I get it.
2904820	2905940	You beat us to it, Dan.
2905940	2907860	Yeah, they'd be like, I saw that coming, I get it.
2907860	2908820	We're so proud of him.
2908820	2910100	He was our little guy.
2910100	2910580	What'd they say?
2911620	2913780	We thought he should have done it sooner?
2913780	2915860	No, they'd be like, I figured that was gonna happen.
2917060	2922180	And they'd be like, well, I'm next, but it's gonna be with like,
2922180	2924420	I'm gonna get diabetes or something.
2924420	2926900	Did your parents lay suicide out as an option?
2926900	2927780	No, no, no.
2927780	2928820	It's just like, I'm the writer.
2928820	2929940	I'm the writer in the family.
2929940	2933140	And they'd be like, well, he's the writer.
2933140	2934420	44 years, that's good.
2934420	2935220	Good for him.
2935220	2936580	I got one more question, Dan.
2936580	2938020	Who do you want to find you?
2940100	2943060	And that could be someone in this audience tonight.
2945940	2947940	Y'all might want to focus a cold bloody.
2947940	2950020	I would want it to be like a technician or something.
2950020	2952660	Okay, someone you don't know, you don't owe anything to.
2952660	2954500	I don't want anybody unduly.
2954500	2955700	That would be part of the whole thing.
2955700	2960020	So we find you and then what do we learn about you from your suicide?
2960820	2963540	You mean, what would I put in the note once I'm finally gone?
2963540	2964900	Yeah, let's start with the note.
2964900	2965060	Yeah.
2965780	2966260	Okay.
2966260	2967460	Why don't I just write my note?
2967460	2968180	Let's do it right.
2968180	2968660	Okay, great.
2969380	2970180	We'll help you.
2970180	2970420	Yeah.
2970420	2971300	We'll help you, Dan.
2971860	2972740	Because it's hard.
2972740	2973220	It's hard.
2973220	2973940	I know it's hard.
2974820	2976580	Dear world.
2976580	2976820	Okay.
2978820	2979460	So sorry.
2979460	2981060	They will play this when you're dead, by the way.
2981060	2981380	Go ahead.
2984420	2986900	You don't want to put him in his head while he's writing this.
2986900	2988740	I guess you saw what I saw.
2988740	2989700	Things are getting hard.
2990420	2997220	Like, don't take this as encouragement to do what I did.
2998180	2999140	I had a good life.
3003140	3004980	Like, I didn't have to fight in any wars.
3005780	3007140	I never had to be hungry.
3008020	3009620	Like, I wasn't a black woman.
3011140	3012660	Dan, can I just stop right now?
3012660	3013540	I'm getting the sense.
3016100	3017700	Some of the best lives on the planet.
3018180	3021620	I'm going to remind you, Beyonce is kicking it right about now.
3021620	3022420	Well, I wasn't.
3022420	3023620	Beyonce is obvious.
3023620	3025060	I think that's the unspoken part of this.
3025060	3028100	What you don't know is that a lot of black women can do the same shit as Beyonce.
3028100	3029140	We just ain't showing off.
3030580	3032820	You want to come back as a black woman.
3034900	3035940	I don't want to be a black woman.
3035940	3039060	Even in my suicide note, I'm persecuted.
3039060	3041860	Well, no, but if I read that...
3043380	3044420	I can't get a break.
3044420	3045700	No, no, no.
3045700	3046180	No, no.
3046180	3047060	I want to help you.
3047140	3050980	I mean, it's funny how, you know, the improvisers are helping the writer.
3051620	3055940	But as I was going through the note, I'm like, that guy would never commit suicide.
3055940	3057620	Sounds like you're trying to talk yourself out of it.
3057620	3058180	Yes.
3058180	3059460	I was never in a war.
3059460	3060660	I had a good life.
3060660	3061140	Right.
3061140	3061700	Right.
3061700	3062260	No, you're right.
3062260	3064340	And I have no plans to kill myself, by the way.
3065460	3065940	You're sure?
3068900	3070100	I mean, you brought it up.
3073540	3074580	This is what friends do.
3074580	3075220	We help out.
3075780	3077140	So how does the note go from there?
3077140	3078500	You say a bunch of positive things about your life.
3078500	3078820	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3078820	3079780	It's got to turn.
3079780	3082020	I say, everybody, you're off the hook, please.
3082020	3083460	I'm so sorry for the mess.
3083460	3087220	Like, I wish that I could have just jumped into a vaporizer or a sarlacc pit.
3087220	3088340	I'm so sorry.
3088340	3092020	Like, for those of you who have found it and all this stuff, I'm so sorry.
3092020	3100900	And then I'd say, you know, I think our species is plagued with a notion that we are not good
3100900	3101620	enough.
3101620	3106180	And I think it provokes us to do things that hurt ourselves and each other.
3106740	3110340	And I think that once you get to the spot that I'm in, go ahead.
3110340	3111380	I think you've got to personalize it.
3111380	3112820	You can't speak of the whole world.
3112820	3113460	You don't represent the whole world.
3113460	3115140	Well, I already said my personal shit.
3115140	3115620	I thought that when you—
3115620	3116980	You said you have a great life.
3116980	3118900	But the world sucks, so I'm going to kill myself.
3119940	3122100	Everybody else is acting like human beings.
3122100	3122740	Well, yeah.
3122740	3124740	I'm not going to wait for my life to—
3124740	3126980	Yeah, if I wait for my life to suck, I'll never kill myself.
3130900	3136420	So you want to go out on a high, like The Carol Burnett Show?
3136420	3136900	Yeah.
3136900	3141540	Well, I mean, it's no big trick to have a comfortable life.
3141540	3144180	It is for some.
3144180	3144820	Yeah.
3144820	3146180	That's why I want to kill myself.
3146740	3149540	So you feel responsibility for the people who are not as successful as you?
3149540	3150180	Yeah.
3150180	3151220	It's hard.
3151220	3152100	They're not as lucky.
3152100	3154020	But it's not reading in your note right now.
3155540	3156580	I'm not getting that.
3156580	3157220	Are you, Scott?
3157220	3158260	Well, I'm just curious.
3158260	3159860	You have regret for being successful.
3159860	3160100	Yeah.
3160100	3160500	Yes.
3160900	3161140	Okay.
3161140	3162500	You can stop that right now.
3163140	3163860	Wait.
3163860	3166100	Well, instead of the suicide, I just give all my money away
3166100	3167460	and then wander around the street.
3167460	3167460	
3168340	3168500	Yeah.
3168500	3171220	You can stop being successful any time you want.
3171220	3173780	But you want to work hard and be successful and get praise
3173780	3175540	and have a thousand people cheer you.
3175540	3176740	No, I don't—
3179700	3182180	That sounded like about 300 people.
3182180	3183380	That was really strange.
3183380	3184340	About 200.
3184340	3184820	Well, yeah.
3187140	3189700	A percentage of a thousand people cheer you.
3189700	3192260	In their defense, 500 of them want to kill themselves.
3192260	3195060	So look at you clap.
3195060	3195300	Yes.
3197220	3197460	All right.
3197460	3198740	Well, let me start my note over.
3198740	3198980	Okay.
3200340	3200740	Kids.
3204740	3205940	It's not going to get any better.
3208660	3209700	The writing's on the wall.
3211700	3218100	From where I was sitting, the next thing that happens is your knees starts to ink
3218180	3221780	and then it gets harder and harder.
3221780	3222820	I'm leaving.
3223620	3223940	Soon.
3224820	3225300	Now.
3225300	3226340	After I finish the letter.
3231140	3232180	Unless there's another draft.
3236500	3241300	I can't— It's hard.
3241300	3242580	It's hard to be on Twitter.
3244740	3244980	What?
3245940	3246740	You guys—
3246740	3247300	What?
3247620	3249060	Another Twitter-related death.
3250740	3252100	You guys seem unhappy.
3253940	3256020	There's not enough gravy.
3256020	3257060	But see, don't you see?
3258340	3259620	I'm going to interrupt your note for a second.
3259620	3259940	Right.
3260580	3263140	You guys are unhappy, so I'm going to kill myself.
3263140	3263620	Right.
3263620	3264020	Okay.
3264020	3265940	I understand the empathy you have.
3265940	3267700	I'm leaving all my money in a box.
3267700	3269060	You remember Stardust Memories?
3269620	3269940	Right.
3269940	3270820	No, well, kind of.
3270820	3271060	Yeah.
3271060	3271460	Okay.
3271460	3274740	So he's suicidal, and he says, why don't I just kill myself?
3274820	3278580	And he says that the alien all-knowing person says to Woody,
3280100	3281620	you're not Superman.
3281620	3282340	You're a comedian.
3282340	3283380	You want to save the world?
3283380	3284980	Tell funny or jokes.
3284980	3285540	Right.
3285540	3286900	You delight people.
3286900	3287300	Right, but—
3287300	3291620	You think people are unhappy, and your job, your delight, is to delight them.
3292260	3293620	So you're making the world better.
3294500	3297460	The world you're complaining about, you're fixing.
3297460	3299140	And so then you take yourself out of it?
3299940	3301940	Yeah, but what about all the people that say,
3302740	3307140	you should go back to work writing cartoons instead of talking about
3307140	3310260	how dumb the president is.
3310260	3311700	And then you're like, well, I don't want to write—
3311700	3313300	What am I supposed to write a cartoon about?
3313300	3314340	They're 13 years old.
3321940	3322740	Not physically.
3327140	3328340	But wait, how did we get it?
3328340	3329300	I never said—
3329300	3330020	When did I—
3330020	3331220	You said the world is unhappy,
3331300	3332020	so I'm going to kill myself.
3332020	3333620	I guess I maybe technically said that.
3334420	3336100	You have an existential crisis.
3336100	3336340	Yeah.
3336340	3339380	But you're intelligent enough to think past an existential crisis.
3339380	3343700	I guess that's what it is, is that we are at a point politically.
3343700	3347620	We've gotten to a point, like, it was easy in the bush years
3347620	3350740	and all this shit with the dangling chads and all that crap.
3350740	3353860	It was very easy to just be like a Han Solo and be like,
3353860	3358180	oh, I have no love for the Empire, but I love to fucking smuggle.
3361380	3364500	As of the election, it was like, are you fucking kidding me?
3364500	3369300	You're either in favor of the mass enslavement of all humanity
3369300	3371380	and absolute fucking apocalypse,
3371380	3374980	or you're part of some rebellion that has to spend its life
3374980	3378660	like flying in X-Wings and doing, like, horrible runs and stuff.
3378660	3384580	And it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, be to the rich, white, lazy piece of shit,
3384580	3384900	you know?
3384900	3387140	Like, you're just like, well, where am I supposed to fit in?
3387140	3388820	I don't want to earn my bread and butter.
3388820	3390900	I don't want to find out what I'm made of.
3391140	3392340	It's a drag.
3392340	3394180	I'd rather be a martyr and just be dead.
3395140	3396180	I think that's what it is.
3396180	3398740	Like, I don't want to be a martyr if you take your own life.
3398740	3400660	You have to take your life.
3400660	3402420	I could make it look like an accident.
3404100	3404820	All right.
3404820	3405620	How would that look?
3406260	3407220	How would you do it?
3407220	3410100	I could have some friends over,
3410100	3411940	and I could have, like, a roller skate party.
3413780	3417380	And I could rent a five-story tower.
3417380	3417780	Okay.
3417780	3419060	And have a roller skate party.
3419060	3419700	A trigger warning.
3419780	3421620	I could just get really drunk and...
3421620	3421940	Come on.
3421940	3422740	All right.
3422740	3423700	No, we were getting somewhere.
3423700	3424980	I liked what we were doing, but...
3426420	3426980	No, I'm not...
3426980	3427620	You're right.
3427620	3432580	What you're saying is that I'm a fat, white, straight...
3432580	3433940	I never said fat or straight.
3433940	3433940	
3436580	3438020	I'm pretty sure that was me.
3439700	3441540	You're saying that my responsibility...
3442100	3445300	It's like, moving forward, you have to live in the fucking apocalypse.
3445300	3449300	You can't dramatize it so much that you can avoid living in it.
3449300	3451380	You actually have to be a character in it.
3451380	3452580	You have to, like, go,
3452580	3454500	okay, so this is the way the world is.
3454500	3455380	It's not normal.
3455380	3456340	It's not good.
3456340	3457060	But I'm in it.
3457060	3457540	You can't be...
3459380	3461380	It's no country for old narcissists.
3463300	3467620	And it's what women and black people do every fucking day.
3472180	3474420	I don't believe there's that many women and black people out there.
3474420	3474740	Scott.
3475940	3478580	Some of you are trying to get at a gravy train.
3478580	3480580	What was the point you were trying to make to Dan?
3482260	3482500	When?
3484020	3485620	When you were saying to him about,
3485620	3489620	okay, you do comedy, you make people's lives better.
3490740	3493380	Yeah, well, he was saying that the world is unhappy,
3493380	3497780	and he's one of the reasons some of us aren't a part of it, anyway.
3497780	3498260	I don't know.
3498260	3498820	Yeah, well, no.
3498820	3502820	It was just like, I think it's like, it's defeatism.
3502820	3504660	That's what we ended up addressing.
3504660	3507220	It's like, a lot of people out there probably feel that way.
3507220	3508260	Like, you wake up in the morning
3508340	3510500	and you're like, holy fuck, how could it be so bad?
3511460	3513220	And how come I can't do anything about it?
3515220	3517140	And then if you react to that with like,
3517140	3521540	oh fuck, I'm gonna just give up or go cynical.
3522580	3524980	That's because you're like, well, the alternative is
3524980	3526900	you have to do shit that's uncomfortable.
3526900	3528340	You gotta strain your back.
3528340	3531460	But at least enjoy being cynical about everything.
3531460	3532500	You can enjoy that.
3533300	3535940	It was easier before to be cynical.
3535940	3537220	You can't be cynical now.
3537220	3538820	It's harder to be cynical now.
3538820	3540740	What happens if you're, I'm still cynical.
3540740	3541940	If you're cynical now,
3541940	3544820	then you're like one of these like libertarian people
3544820	3547460	that's like this, an Asperger Trump voter.
3548980	3550900	You're like one of these Silicon Valley people
3550900	3553780	that's like, meet, moop, logic says, no Hillary
3553780	3555460	because her emails, like, it's like,
3556740	3559460	I'm not, I don't wanna, I'm not gonna be one of those people.
3559460	3562100	I'm not gonna be like, meet, moop, logic says,
3562100	3563380	be a fucking Nazi.
3563380	3564580	Like, I'm not doing it.
3564580	3566020	You could be a Schindler.
3566020	3568420	You could use your ring to buy 800 Jews.
3568420	3569380	I would like to be a Schindler.
3569380	3570980	You could be a Schindler.
3570980	3572660	There's a lot of, this is a great opportunity
3572660	3574180	for all of us to be heroes.
3574180	3576420	Let's all be Schindlers. Because it's so very bad.
3576420	3578020	Even the small amount of shit you do.
3582020	3583940	What did Schindler do again?
3583940	3584660	Schindler. Not enough.
3584660	3585460	He didn't do enough.
3588340	3589300	He could have done more.
3590980	3593540	In his defense, that was a sweet fucking ring.
3594420	3595700	It was a beautiful ring.
3596020	3603060	I see like, I see like young black women,
3603060	3606180	like millennial black women on Twitter who are like,
3606820	3611380	like, like going like, trying to rally like the democratic cause.
3611380	3614100	And then they're like up against like,
3614100	3617300	this thing that's like, you can't even, you can't dismiss it.
3618020	3622100	Like, we got behind Hillary and she lost.
3622100	3624580	And so there's like this thing that's like,
3624580	3626420	we're looking down the barrel of this thing.
3626420	3629140	It's like, don't look at your watch.
3629140	3630020	I have a show at 10.
3631940	3634180	It's like, we're going to go up against this thing.
3634180	3635220	Like, there's just this cloud.
3635220	3637540	Like, you got to be on the other side of the cloud.
3637540	3640020	And like, we can't get along with each other.
3640020	3642260	Like, we're like, there's like genuine socialists.
3642260	3644420	And I see everything that they're saying.
3644420	3645780	They're like, yeah, fucking like,
3645780	3648180	why do we keep mitigating our language about this?
3648180	3649300	Why do we keep playing ball?
3649300	3650900	Why are we acting like politicians
3650900	3652100	when it's not going to work?
3652180	3654660	We're in a political debate with professional politicians.
3654660	3656660	Why don't we just revolt and resist
3656660	3658100	and have resistance mean something
3658100	3659940	and be socialists and leftists.
3660660	3666260	And that's 30% of our 900 audience.
3666260	3669300	And then there's the other people that are just like, fuck, man.
3669300	3671860	No, we got to get behind one boulder and push it.
3671860	3673860	Otherwise, the boulder is not going to go anywhere
3673860	3676340	because it's up against another boulder.
3676340	3678580	It's like all the evil people, they have no problem
3678580	3680100	getting along because they all agree
3680100	3681780	that they should just lie and hang out.
3682100	3686660	Like, so then those people equally sensible to me
3686660	3688420	are like, no, let's be Democrats
3688420	3689780	because how else are we going to win?
3689780	3691540	You got to, if you don't like Pepsi,
3691540	3693620	if Pepsi's owned by Hitler, guess what?
3693620	3694420	You love Coke.
3696340	3697140	And I hate that.
3697140	3697700	I hate that.
3697700	3698260	I hate that.
3698260	3700180	I hate fucking being forced to drink Coke
3700180	3701460	just because Pepsi's Hitler.
3701460	3702740	It fucking sucks.
3704500	3705940	But what are you going to do?
3705940	3708580	Be Sierra Mist and have no one drink you ever?
3709060	3711780	Just to spite corn syrup?
3713300	3715700	I don't know what to do, so I want to kill myself.
3717140	3720340	Because I don't want to be a passive party to it.
3720340	3724020	I just want to go quietly into my mansion
3724020	3727220	and just write a little note and then say,
3727220	3728340	hope you like season three.
3731540	3732340	We better.
3734980	3736740	I mean, what do you do, Jimmy Carain?
3738580	3744180	I don't mean to say your last name like an attack.
3744900	3746340	What do you do, Jimmy Carain?
3747140	3747940	What do you do?
3747940	3749060	What do you do?
3749060	3750100	Who did you vote for?
3750740	3751940	Put your dick out.
3753060	3753620	Tell us.
3754180	3757540	Stop interviewing people like you do on your podcast.
3757540	3759860	Your top rated fair audio podcast.
3761460	3762660	Yeah, thanks for the plug, Dan.
3762660	3764100	You're welcome, you piece of shit.
3765540	3766740	Tell us who you are.
3766820	3768420	Scott Adson, season six of Veep.
3770340	3772900	Brandon Johnson, I'm selling stolen coats in the alleyway.
3776100	3776420	Dan?
3777060	3777460	Yeah?
3777460	3778340	What would you like to know?
3779460	3781060	I'd like to know.
3781060	3781860	I feel...
3783220	3784660	Well, who'd you vote for?
3785700	3786980	I voted in the primary.
3786980	3788260	I voted for Bernie Sanders.
3788820	3797220	And then I had huge resentment towards the Democratic Party,
3797220	3800180	because I didn't like how they treated Bernie Sanders,
3800180	3801060	and I didn't vote.
3801860	3802740	Whoa.
3802740	3803220	Wow.
3806500	3807620	I'll respect his bravery.
3807620	3808100	Yeah.
3808100	3810660	That wasn't going to be a fun thing to say out loud.
3811540	3813780	It's time to open up a can of privilege.
3814500	3818820	I needed you.
3819700	3820660	I needed you.
3821860	3823620	White people we trusted you.
3825060	3826820	Fucking up without Iraq war.
3827380	3830580	And then we let you run around, and this is what you fucking do.
3831860	3833300	Well, we taking that shit back.
3834740	3835780	We taking it back.
3836420	3839700	The next candidate we run is going to be a black burn victim,
3840580	3844180	who was in a wheelchair just to send you a message.
3844900	3846100	God damn it.
3846100	3849460	You don't know what to do, because you never had to fight.
3849460	3850980	You shouldn't be fighting right now,
3850980	3852900	because we shouldn't be this far gone.
3852900	3853860	But neither we are.
3854420	3855620	That's what you do.
3855620	3856660	You get involved.
3856660	3857620	God damn it.
3864900	3866580	Is there a connection, you think,
3866580	3869780	between Jimmy not voting in the election
3869780	3871300	and Dan wanting to kill himself?
3871940	3874980	It's both these two people that didn't get their way
3874980	3877220	and kind of don't want to do what they think
3877220	3879460	is the hard work they need to do.
3879460	3881540	And just kind of having a little tantrum.
3881540	3882340	No offense.
3882340	3884020	Yes, none taken.
3884020	3886580	I mean, some taken, but I-
3886580	3888100	But isn't there a similarness there?
3888100	3889780	I mean, it seems like it might just be,
3889780	3892500	I mean, last week we talked about white fragility.
3892500	3893380	Fragility.
3893380	3894020	Yeah.
3894020	3894900	No offense to me.
3895060	3897940	I thank you so much for your honesty, by the way.
3897940	3899940	This is a very great discussion to have.
3899940	3900740	But I don't know.
3900740	3902900	It's just, it's this thing, right?
3902900	3906580	The people who aren't used to dealing with adversity,
3906580	3908500	they deal with adversity, and they kind of
3908500	3910420	don't know how to deal with it, because they're not
3910420	3912980	conditioned to do it, like underprivileged people
3912980	3913700	tend to be.
3913700	3915700	Well, and the thing is, Dan, you still
3915700	3917540	have hope for the Democratic Party.
3917540	3919620	I've totally like, I feel betrayed
3919620	3922980	by the Democratic Party, and I feel like both parties
3922980	3924340	are taking corporate money.
3924340	3924820	Yeah.
3924900	3926740	I'm totally hopeless about that.
3926740	3929460	Yeah, and I was never, I was never,
3929460	3931300	this is like my entree into politics,
3931300	3933860	because I was like, I always looked at the bipartisan system
3933860	3936580	as being part of one big fucking Pringles sham,
3936580	3938340	where it was like, oh, what do you like?
3938340	3940180	Ranch or cool ranch?
3942180	3945620	And then we elected a fucking legit Nazi,
3945620	3948020	and I was like, holy shit, how do we fight this?
3948020	3950340	And I started like analyzing it, and it was like,
3950340	3954100	wait, you can't be in the resistance
3954100	3957700	and also be surrounded by hip people all the time.
3957700	3961780	Like, you're going to sometimes be around morons
3961780	3967460	if you represent the interest of a majority of people,
3967460	3970100	because most people are stupid.
3970100	3972420	But if you're on the side that the rebellion's on
3972420	3975700	in the Star Wars universe, it's like, yeah, there's a guy.
3975700	3979060	This is fat wing, x-wing guys who you wanted to die.
3979060	3981060	It's like, you got to just go, oh,
3981060	3983380	the galaxy's made up of a bunch of different people,
3983380	3986580	and who knows, the slugs get along with the lobsters
3986580	3988340	or whatever the fuck, who cares?
3988340	3990900	But I know I don't want to be fucking Christopher Lee,
3990900	3992420	like pinching people's necks shut,
3992420	3994820	just because they don't dress like a Girl Scout.
3996660	3999140	I don't side with the Death Star, period.
3999140	4001300	How about we don't judge the people we're trying to help?
4002180	4002980	What's that?
4002980	4004340	We don't judge the people we're trying to help.
4004340	4004900	Well, you can't.
4004900	4007460	Yeah, you can't be like a populist.
4007460	4011460	You can't go like, oh, I believe that a society
4011540	4014580	should be judged by the quality of life
4014580	4018580	of its least fortunate people, and then simultaneously be like,
4018580	4019860	that dude smells like a shoe.
4021380	4021940	You can.
4021940	4023460	You can give a homeless dude a dollar
4023460	4024980	and still say he smells like piss
4024980	4026820	and you don't want him to sit on your couch.
4026820	4029540	But at least go the step of giving the motherfucker a dollar.
4030820	4032340	I think that guys like me and Jimmy,
4034340	4036020	we're used to that stuff, but we're not
4036020	4038500	used to the laser line dividing.
4039460	4042260	It's that laser line that divides the Bernie crap
4042260	4043700	from the Hillary crat or whatever.
4044660	4048420	We had it easy, except that I did not vote.
4050660	4053380	I was behind Bernie and hoped that Bernie would,
4053380	4054660	I was like, go Bernie.
4054660	4056820	And I stayed out of it because of the gender thing,
4056820	4060980	because I did not want to, I was like, this is trouble.
4060980	4061780	This is a hot button.
4061780	4065140	And the last thing we need is divisiveness right now.
4065140	4068340	And then once she had secured the nomination,
4068660	4070820	I was like, fucking, all right, full steam ahead.
4070820	4072900	Let's all vote for her because she's a Democrat
4072900	4074340	and we need to defeat these Nazis.
4078180	4079780	And it's just that stinking thinking
4079780	4082580	to 30% of you who cheered for the other thing.
4082580	4083860	And I don't want those people dismissed
4083860	4084900	because they're smart people.
4086260	4088660	But yeah, that's where I was at.
4089540	4091860	The truth be told, I didn't show up for no primary vote
4091860	4094180	because this whole system's a piece of shit.
4094820	4095940	Fuck your primaries.
4095940	4097540	This is a bipartisan system.
4097540	4099300	These people built a fucking government
4099300	4100740	on top of our Constitution.
4100740	4102020	Fuck these assholes.
4102020	4102980	It's garbage.
4102980	4104900	Fuck them, fuck them, fuck them, fuck them, fuck them.
4104900	4106020	Fuck them in the eye.
4106020	4107620	But God damn it.
4109380	4111300	One half of them has been hacked.
4111300	4114420	The half of the fucked up system has been hacked
4115060	4118020	by a cancer, by a virus.
4118020	4121060	They've moved in white nationalists,
4121060	4124020	actual Nazis, possibly Russian spies.
4124020	4125220	Don't even go there.
4125220	4126980	Just forget all the Russiagate.
4127060	4128420	They're just white nationalists.
4128420	4130260	They hacked the Republican Party.
4131540	4133540	Our dream that the bipartisan system,
4133540	4134820	which has been shoved down our throats
4134820	4137620	since we were born, would collapse,
4137620	4139700	that dream came true in a way that maybe
4139700	4141700	is not as convenient for us as we thought it would be.
4142740	4144580	Starting with the Republicans going like,
4144580	4145300	oh, fuck it.
4145300	4146180	Hitler's running.
4146180	4146660	OK.
4146660	4148260	Well, as long as he's wearing a red hat.
4150500	4152900	That represented the end of the Republican Party.
4152900	4154020	If we live through this,
4154740	4158740	I don't know how the Republicans could be fucking dead.
4158740	4160100	And that's a great thing.
4160100	4165060	On the other side, the Democrats also got hacked
4165060	4166980	in the sense that there was a socialist
4166980	4168260	running on the Democratic ticket.
4168260	4172020	And my first vote was for Ross Perot.
4172020	4173220	I was 18 years old.
4173220	4175300	And I was like, fucking, let's do it.
4176900	4178500	And he was a third party candidate.
4178500	4180900	And third party candidates can't win and all that stuff.
4180900	4183060	So I'm off on a tangent.
4183060	4185460	And just saying, I'm 44.
4185460	4188420	I was like, OK, Democrat.
4188420	4191060	We're Democrat then because we have to get this done.
4191060	4194100	But I am sick and tired of being told by this system
4194100	4197060	that we're in a state of fucking emergency the entire time.
4197060	4198580	When are we ever going to achieve
4198580	4201620	this unachievable dream where we're voting our conscience?
4201620	4203140	And I know that that speaks to privilege.
4203140	4203620	I do.
4203620	4206500	I know how silly that sounds to a Democrat.
4206500	4207460	Just me.
4207460	4207940	Just me.
4208820	4212900	And that's the thing is that black women
4212900	4214340	are the ones that are turning me.
4214340	4216020	When I look at them on Twitter, I'm like,
4216020	4217780	they're the ones that are putting up the most shit.
4217780	4223140	They're the ones that, and I'm just like, I'm looking at,
4223140	4225940	I think the Statue of Liberty now is just like a black woman,
4225940	4228740	a black millennial woman who is like, fuck it.
4228740	4229860	I've been hurt.
4229860	4231060	I don't give a fuck.
4231060	4234260	I still believe in some form of some system.
4234260	4236580	I have every reason to self-destruct.
4236580	4238580	But I'm just going to be a Democrat,
4238580	4240100	and I'm just going to push this boulder,
4240100	4240980	and we're going to push it.
4240980	4243540	And I look at them as being heroes right now,
4243540	4247460	because they're not being treated very like people are just
4247460	4247940	coming.
4247940	4250420	They have to deal with the meet, meet, moop, moops.
4250420	4252500	It's just dudes coming out and going like, no, no,
4252500	4253380	son, that's interesting.
4253380	4254340	What about the drone strikes?
4254340	4255220	What about the emails?
4256820	4258980	I love that a black woman comes home from work and is like,
4258980	4260580	man, a goddamn meet, meet, meet, moop.
4262020	4262740	Fucking with me?
4263620	4264740	I'm trying to buy some groceries,
4264740	4266100	and this motherfucking meet, meet, meet, moop.
4266180	4267620	Tell me I need a coupon.
4267620	4269140	I don't know what to do, Jimmy Crane.
4269140	4269860	I don't know what to do.
4270660	4272020	I don't know what we're supposed to do.
4272020	4272500	We're supposed to ask.
4272500	4274340	The first thing you should do is ask another white person
4276740	4279780	about how to lead you out of some treacherous moments.
4281780	4282820	I didn't hear what he said.
4288340	4289140	I said, huh?
4289140	4290820	And I don't have to.
4290820	4291540	I don't care for laughs.
4294180	4294820	Turn his mic off.
4294820	4295460	Turn his mic off!
4296980	4297380	Okay.
4297380	4301380	Let's fix America with an amazing scene.
4302260	4303780	Let's use our stagecraft.
4306660	4306980	Right?
4307540	4308420	I don't know.
4308420	4309860	That's what it's for, man.
4309860	4310100	Yeah.
4311140	4312820	You've been awful quiet, 30 Rock.
4312820	4312980	Yeah.
4312980	4313940	Who'd you vote for?
4313940	4314440	Yeah.
4317300	4319220	You are uncomfortable with this one, aren't you?
4319220	4321540	Tell Tina Hefftfeh who you voted for.
4323380	4324260	I voted for Trump.
4326580	4327380	You're not joking.
4328340	4330740	Jesus Christ on a cracker.
4330740	4332580	It's the 1st of April, everyone.
4332580	4333220	Hello!
4333220	4334660	It is the 1st of April.
4337940	4340340	I was ready to go by 10 minutes on how I support Trump.
4342420	4343860	Did you really vote for Trump?
4343860	4344340	No!
4344340	4344820	Okay.
4353460	4354820	Since I've known you at Columbia,
4354820	4356660	you're getting to be a better and better actor.
4358500	4359700	I can't believe it.
4359700	4361220	That was so convincing.
4362260	4363060	So brief.
4363060	4368660	What if America was a child born at the dawn of progress?
4385780	4386900	He's beautiful.
4387860	4388900	Yes, he is.
4390580	4392660	I want poor people.
4395540	4398340	Bill, I don't know about this one.
4399700	4401140	He wants poor people.
4401140	4404340	Now what self-respecting little baby would want poor people?
4404980	4410500	Give me your weary, your wretched masses.
4411460	4414740	I want to hang out with the dirty folk.
4416340	4421060	I'm worried about the boy because no baby full of immigrants can succeed.
4424420	4425380	You're right, Bill.
4428180	4430420	Apox upon you, mother and father.
4431860	4433780	Don't you talk to Europe like that.
4434980	4436500	I'll talk how I want.
4436500	4438980	I have freedom of speech.
4440660	4443700	The right to assemble all my dirty parts.
4445460	4447540	I will learn to do skateboard tricks.
4448740	4450740	And if you come to invade me,
4450740	4453060	you'll be so tired from the trip
4453060	4457060	that you won't be able to deal with the fact that we fight like Indians now.
4457060	4458020	Bill, is this what happened?
4459140	4461380	Bill, is this what happened when we're on fertility?
4461380	4463220	I mean, I don't understand this.
4464820	4465860	What are you doing?
4465860	4467780	I'm learning to skateboard.
4467780	4470100	You're too young to be riding a skateboard.
4470500	4474820	I love tea in the harbor.
4476500	4482740	I love suffrage for everyone but black people and women.
4483940	4487060	I feel like I want to interpret his movements as some symbol of something.
4492820	4496660	I'm 14 now in America years.
4496660	4498900	That means it's 1812.
4498900	4499620	We know what it means.
4499620	4500500	Yes, it does.
4501940	4503700	Your mother now has menopause.
4504740	4507220	And we've gone through a strange confusing war
4507940	4512100	during which the White House was burnt to the ground by a Canadian advancing army.
4512100	4513700	Oh, please don't bring that up.
4513700	4514740	Not in this house.
4514740	4515780	He's very bookish.
4515780	4516500	Yes.
4516500	4518420	Mind your own business.
4518420	4519940	I want my own room.
4519940	4521140	I'm an isolationist.
4525860	4528420	Bill, he's been up there for hours.
4529380	4531060	What are you doing up there, young man?
4532420	4534100	I smell something funny.
4534980	4536820	Are you going to do something?
4536820	4538500	Sorry, I didn't mean to talk over you.
4540500	4542100	There's only telegram technology.
4542100	4544340	So that's how the wars happen.
4544340	4544740	Stop.
4549940	4551780	Finally, Bill, you're disciplining him.
4551780	4553940	He's been talking over me since he's been born.
4554900	4557620	I have learned from the Chinese and Mexicans
4557620	4560420	that there's such a thing as opium and marijuana.
4562660	4564260	I am having a great time.
4566180	4567140	How old are you now?
4568340	4569620	17.
4569620	4572020	Which makes it 1848.
4573620	4577460	So we're almost cleaning up all of the Native Americans.
4578900	4580820	And your father had an affair.
4581140	4583220	With France.
4583220	4584020	Yes.
4585380	4586260	Bill.
4586260	4588020	Yeah, right.
4590020	4592100	You don't know your father's name?
4592740	4595220	It's King England.
4596660	4597460	Kingland.
4600020	4601860	You dress it up how you want.
4602980	4607380	Taxation without representation is get off my back, old man.
4607380	4609620	We've already discussed that a long time ago.
4610580	4610980	Okay.
4610980	4611620	Well, I don't.
4611620	4612020	I don't.
4612020	4612580	Okay, fine.
4614420	4614900	Well.
4614900	4616420	But you go off and live on your own.
4616420	4616740	Yes.
4616740	4618340	See, we'll see how well we do.
4618340	4619060	Oh, yeah.
4619060	4619620	Oh, thanks.
4619620	4620820	Not going to get anything from us.
4620820	4621860	Yes, that's over.
4622420	4624260	Chinaman, make the railroads.
4626420	4628660	It's in the way that you use it.
4631140	4631380	Both of you.
4631380	4633780	Sure, anyone can succeed with Chinaman.
4633780	4634100	Yes.
4634100	4634740	Yeah.
4634740	4636420	Mexicans, grow everything.
4636420	4637860	Black people, work for free.
4638820	4639140	Oh.
4639140	4640260	We're nailing it.
4641060	4642100	Look at this, Bill.
4642100	4642820	Chaching.
4642820	4643060	Chaching.
4643060	4643940	Look at this, Bill.
4643940	4644260	Chaching.
4644260	4644660	Chaching.
4644660	4647060	Our son's first job is at a Starbucks.
4647060	4647220	Yeah.
4647220	4648980	And we walked in on X by accident.
4648980	4649780	Oh, hi, Mom.
4649780	4650740	Hi, Dad.
4650740	4654580	Nice to meet you at the 1914 United...
4655620	4658740	A League of Nations, I think.
4658740	4660100	Let's say 1911-ish.
4660100	4661460	Okay.
4661460	4662340	Hey, how are you?
4663140	4664260	Grand latte, please.
4664260	4664740	Oh.
4665540	4666820	Would you...
4666820	4668980	Wait, I'm working at a coffee shop?
4668980	4669460	Yes.
4669460	4670420	Yes.
4670420	4671140	Okay.
4671140	4672340	Yes.
4672340	4673060	All right, fine.
4673060	4673860	Here you go.
4673860	4676100	That'll be $500, bitch.
4678420	4679940	You're going to call your mother a bitch?
4680740	4681860	You're going to invade me?
4686100	4688420	Our audience says it's 9-11.
4689620	4691140	That didn't happen yet.
4695460	4696980	Okay, here's $500.
4696980	4698500	Yeah, you're welcome, France.
4700180	4701220	Thank you for your help.
4701220	4702500	You're welcome, England.
4703460	4704260	Bill.
4704260	4705940	You guys want a fucking straw?
4705940	4706740	Because that's $40.
4708100	4709060	Yeah, we'll take a straw.
4709060	4710180	Yeah, guess what?
4710180	4712900	The fucking dollar is what rules the earth now.
4712900	4713860	All right.
4713860	4716500	We came by, actually, to ask if we could borrow some money.
4716500	4717220	Oh, really?
4717940	4721940	So grandpa's divine right didn't earn you anything at the bank?
4722580	4723380	Muh fuck.
4725700	4728100	We're thinking maybe we did some things wrong.
4728100	4729380	We'd like to try it again.
4729380	4729940	Yes.
4729940	4732500	Would you like to supplant your existing class system
4732500	4736100	based on inheritance with a new one based on a meritocracy?
4736100	4737300	Let's not go too far.
4739060	4740340	The class system works.
4741940	4743620	I'll believe it when I see it.
4743620	4745300	Bill, I told you this wouldn't work with him.
4745860	4747860	He's just so stubborn.
4749300	4750420	Hey, Seuss.
4750420	4751380	They need more.
4751380	4753060	They need some money from petty cash.
4753780	4758340	I'm too busy being high on snorting money.
4758340	4759620	Yeah, we're all fucking rich.
4761060	4763300	So I guess just, like, here you go.
4763300	4764260	Like, look, look.
4764260	4765060	Talk to us later.
4765620	4766100	All right.
4766100	4766820	Well, thanks.
4766820	4767380	Thank you.
4767380	4767860	Okay.
4767860	4768340	Thank you.
4768980	4771060	And say hi to Germany for us.
4771060	4771860	Could I have a muffin?
4772500	4772820	Yes.
4772820	4773780	Here's a free muffin.
4775540	4776260	Could I have a hug?
4777140	4777620	Oh.
4778500	4778980	All right.
4779620	4780900	Just for the time being.
4781780	4782580	The 60s.
4791860	4793140	So it's now the 60s?
4793140	4793540	Yes.
4793540	4794020	Okay.
4794020	4794260	All right.
4794260	4795220	We skipped World War II.
4795220	4796580	That was the only thing I would have known how to do.
4799220	4800980	Do you want to go right to Vietnam?
4800980	4801380	Yeah.
4801380	4801540	Okay.
4801540	4802580	So will that help you?
4802580	4803700	We can go right to Vietnam.
4803700	4804740	Whoa!
4804740	4805540	I'm on acid.
4807140	4809140	You're really a disappointment.
4809140	4809380	Yes.
4809380	4810740	Yeah, but everyone's equal.
4811380	4812180	Maybe he's right.
4816020	4817060	Money's everything.
4817060	4818660	Let's just imitate him for a while.
4818660	4820020	I think that's a good idea.
4820020	4820980	Look, at the end of the day.
4820980	4822420	Nothing else has worked with him.
4822420	4826100	It doesn't matter if you're president, king, a nun, a pope.
4826100	4828900	Suck my dick, eat some fondue, and do some cocaine.
4829780	4830420	Okay.
4830420	4830660	All right.
4830660	4832020	We'll suck it first.
4832020	4834340	It's in the way that you use it.
4835220	4835860	Uh-uh.
4836740	4838020	Bell bottoms go.
4838020	4839700	Give your mom a little bump.
4839700	4840660	There we go.
4840660	4843220	Let freedom ring with these bell bottoms.
4843220	4843860	Bill?
4843860	4844660	Bing bong.
4845460	4846660	Bing bong.
4852820	4855220	I haven't felt like a woman in years, Bill.
4855220	4856020	Thank you.
4856020	4857860	It's the 80s, bitches.
4857860	4858980	Guess what?
4858980	4861380	The dollar is now a micro dollar.
4861380	4863780	You can now make a dollar inside a dollar.
4864340	4869460	With an integrated dollar chip that makes multiple dollars come out and go up through
4869460	4871780	a ragonomic chip onto an internet.
4872820	4873620	Just trust me.
4873620	4875300	There's no more gold back in anything.
4875300	4876500	It's just dollars.
4877140	4878420	Dollar, dollar bill.
4878420	4880020	Dollar, dollar bill.
4880020	4880900	Meat mop.
4880900	4882100	Dollar, dollar bill.
4882100	4882820	Yes, he does.
4883380	4885940	These bell bottoms are getting in the way of my robot dancing.
4886660	4888100	Snip, snap.
4888100	4888580	Velcro.
4889220	4889940	Zip.
4889940	4890580	Zipper.
4890580	4891060	Zipper.
4891620	4892660	The market has spoken.
4892660	4893620	He must be right.
4893620	4894900	Yes, he definitely is right.
4894900	4897460	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
4897460	4899460	I like his chunky jewelry as well.
4901700	4903860	You can make cocaine out of Windex.
4906820	4908340	Progress, motherfucker.
4909620	4913140	But if you're black and you get caught with it, you go to prison forever.
4914900	4916020	Bill, Bill, Bill.
4916740	4917300	Welcome.
4917300	4918660	It's 1976.
4918660	4920580	It's the country's bicentennial.
4920580	4921140	All right.
4921140	4922500	It's the bicentennial.
4922500	4922980	Oh, hey.
4923140	4923620	Yeah.
4923620	4924100	Okay.
4924100	4925540	You've got a suit on now.
4925540	4925940	What?
4926820	4927140	Yes.
4929540	4930420	I was in the 80s.
4930420	4931620	I had done the 80s, but...
4932980	4936500	I don't know if that was clear to me because cocaine with the Windex,
4936500	4938020	I think was more late 70s.
4938020	4938820	I'm sure.
4938820	4940500	I don't think it really came mainstream.
4940500	4942660	It was like when cable first came, it didn't really come.
4942660	4943460	It took 10 years.
4943460	4945940	But sweetie, he did say this is the 80s, bitches.
4948500	4949140	Bill, you're right.
4950900	4951540	I'm sorry.
4952100	4953540	I didn't ask to be born.
4954660	4955380	Fireworks.
4955380	4956900	America, we're sorry.
4956900	4957620	We're sorry.
4958340	4959460	Love us, America.
4960020	4962500	I don't even know who you are anymore.
4963380	4964820	I hate Iraq.
4964820	4966340	I hate Iran.
4966340	4968980	I hate Iraq more than Iran.
4968980	4970420	No, I hate Iran.
4971220	4973140	I hate everyone in the Middle East.
4973140	4975620	I love Jews, but not the ones I live with.
4982340	4984500	Just get off my fucking back!
4984500	4986340	Son, look out for those planes.
4986340	4987300	It's 9-11.
4996340	4998340	Wait, that time the audience didn't cheer.
5001380	5003380	Look at how Chicago just shits on New York.
5008660	5009460	Mom, dad.
5010180	5010660	Yes?
5010740	5011780	We heard about what happened.
5011780	5012500	Yes.
5012500	5014100	We're heartsick by it.
5014100	5014900	We sent a card.
5014900	5016900	They were the tallest buildings ever.
5016900	5017940	They came out of nowhere.
5020020	5020580	I know.
5020580	5021380	You're gonna be okay.
5021380	5022180	Well, so listen.
5022180	5024020	I want to invade everybody, okay?
5025540	5025860	Honey.
5025860	5027060	Just need a little bit of help.
5027060	5029940	Honey, that's just a reaction to what's going on right now.
5029940	5030660	We got a fucking...
5030660	5031540	We're a war.
5031540	5032260	We're a war.
5033620	5035220	I think you're just lashing out, but okay.
5035220	5035940	We'll support you.
5035940	5037220	We're just lashing out.
5037220	5037460	Yes.
5037460	5040980	But do some research before you decide where to go.
5040980	5042260	You calling me ignorant?
5043380	5044500	We just think you're just...
5045220	5046740	It's kind of a knee-jerk reaction.
5046740	5048900	A lot of people are thinking the same way you are right now.
5048900	5050500	You fuck think the same way.
5050500	5051220	France?
5051220	5052500	Fuck your french fries.
5053780	5055700	Fuck your Muhammad Ali...
5058500	5058980	I don't care.
5058980	5060100	I don't have to read.
5060740	5061620	You a bitch.
5062900	5063940	I'm America.
5064580	5065220	Fuck you.
5065780	5066260	Freedom.
5067460	5068180	You're jealous.
5068740	5069700	Y'all jealous.
5070500	5071140	When did you become...
5071140	5071620	Fuck you.
5071620	5072260	Check it out.
5074260	5075140	Shock.
5076180	5076660	Aw.
5080260	5080660	Boom.
5081220	5081700	Boom.
5081700	5082180	Boom.
5082180	5082580	Boom.
5082580	5083380	Boom.
5083380	5084660	You got a problem with this?
5086180	5088580	Honey, you are not thinking straight.
5088580	5090020	You ain't thinking straight.
5090020	5093060	You want a bunker buster up your ass, bitch.
5093060	5093940	Oh, Bill.
5093940	5095380	When did you become like this?
5096100	5096340	Yes.
5096340	5097460	You're not our son anymore.
5097460	5097700	No.
5098260	5099540	Oh, that's how it's going to be.
5101860	5102180	All right.
5103860	5104740	Well, check it out.
5105940	5107380	I'm going to fucking run and cry.
5109620	5111860	I want you to think about what you've done
5111860	5113620	and then try to make improvements.
5113620	5116100	I need hope and change.
5126980	5127460	Boom.
5129540	5130980	My God, he's so attractive.
5130980	5131860	Oh, my God.
5133300	5133780	Hello.
5134740	5134980	Hi.
5136660	5136980	Hi.
5138900	5140500	You look fantastic, son.
5140500	5141300	Yes.
5141300	5143300	I don't have much time to talk to you.
5143300	5145460	I've got a lot of drone strikes to do.
5148820	5149300	Okay.
5152820	5155380	There's been no change to the existing class system,
5155380	5157540	but I'm wearing a suit and I'm very sexy.
5157540	5159220	You look fantastic.
5159220	5159460	Yes.
5159460	5161380	I didn't even recognize you.
5161380	5161860	Yep.
5161860	5164420	It must be the 4% unemployment.
5165460	5166500	It looks good on you.
5168420	5171620	So, I don't need anything from you.
5173940	5175940	Just thought I'd come by and...
5177860	5179780	Again, you look fantastic.
5179780	5180500	Yeah.
5180500	5182580	You've dropped a lot of cynicism.
5182580	5184900	Your father is too proud to say this.
5184900	5185860	Your father?
5185860	5190500	Well, you should probably not pigeonhole him into a gender role.
5190500	5191300	Wow.
5191300	5191620	Wow.
5194820	5196100	He might be my mother.
5196100	5196740	I don't know.
5196740	5197060	Okay.
5197780	5201220	Well, you know he's got that heart thing?
5202180	5203380	We all have a heart thing.
5203380	5204020	Well, I'm talking about...
5204020	5207460	The planet has a heart thing and America has a heart thing.
5207460	5207860	Wow.
5209220	5210260	I can't believe it.
5210260	5214580	Well, anyways, it's, you know, like a serious heart thing.
5215860	5219940	And he needs medical, you know, medical coverage.
5219940	5221940	And we just don't seem to...
5221940	5225220	All our money is going to insurance.
5225860	5226820	So, you all want money?
5227460	5228100	Or we'll die.
5234180	5235700	Oh, what is that odor?
5237780	5238740	Oh, my God.
5239700	5240340	Oh, no.
5240340	5240580	No.
5241620	5242500	Oh, God.
5242500	5244180	Something's coming out of his stomach.
5244260	5245460	Remember me, bitch.
5246580	5247380	It's the 80s.
5247380	5247860	Oh, no.
5252180	5253460	It's unexplainable.
5253460	5254100	Oh, my God.
5255620	5258260	How did the 80s spring out of that perfect man?
5258260	5258980	I don't know.
5258980	5260340	It's got the head of Reagan.
5260340	5261620	We never broke up.
5261620	5263380	We just took a long break, bitch.
5265060	5268100	But I thought you were going to say you were going to help us with health insurance.
5268100	5268580	Yeah.
5268580	5269780	Surprise, bitch.
5270580	5271380	Oh, nope.
5273300	5276580	No more need for wit when you've got it.
5279780	5281140	I'm America.
5281140	5282740	It's 2016.
5282740	5286500	I'm 45 years old, I guess, if you're following the...
5288740	5289940	I'm going to masturbate.
5289940	5291540	Oh, I have knives on my fingers.
5291540	5293300	It hurts, but I won't admit it.
5293300	5293780	Ow.
5294980	5295700	Ow.
5295700	5297780	I'm pretending it feels great.
5298660	5300420	I'm going to come any minute now.
5300420	5302180	I'm not mangling my penis.
5303060	5304420	Oh, God.
5304420	5305460	It hurts.
5305460	5306660	Oh, God.
5306660	5307620	Oh, God.
5307620	5308180	It hurts.
5308180	5310820	I'm bleeding to death, but the blood is good.
5310820	5311860	The blood is calm.
5312580	5313700	I come red.
5313700	5314100	Come.
5314900	5317780	Oh, coal is important.
5317780	5326260	Oh, oh, I was never racist, ever.
5326260	5327620	I was never racist.
5327620	5329060	You were supposed to take care of us.
5330820	5331780	I want a divorce.
5334740	5335540	Oh, shit.
5336980	5338020	I'm just going to take a...
5339140	5341540	I'm going to exit this marriage.
5343060	5344100	It's a mexit.
5346900	5347700	A mexit?
5349300	5349860	Bye-bye.
5356340	5356820	Oh, no.
5357780	5358340	Oh, no.
5360260	5360900	Oh, shit.
5364180	5370420	I hope one of his spies doesn't have a dossier on me getting pissed on.
5373220	5374260	Well, I'm proud I did it.
5376340	5378020	That's my right to be taken care of.
5381460	5386580	Mom, there's nothing more I can do, bitch.
5388580	5390420	Maternity is a disease.
5391460	5392900	Pregnancy is your fault.
5394100	5396500	I won't help you not get pregnant.
5396500	5398900	If you do get pregnant, it's your problem.
5399460	5404500	If you have a miscarriage, you have to carry the dead baby around until you die yourself.
5406020	5408340	If you lactate, I don't lactate.
5410020	5413460	If you live in a trailer park, I don't understand
5413940	5417540	anything about what you need.
5418580	5423300	I don't understand if you're France or women.
5427140	5428340	That about sums you up.
5435300	5438900	I never expected to be here.
5438900	5439700	I didn't know.
5439700	5440740	I didn't want this.
5440740	5442500	I didn't think this would ever happen.
5442580	5447700	That's why my symbol is just a frog from a cartoon.
5448980	5450660	Everything about me is unintentional.
5452500	5456420	It almost suggests outside collusion from a foreign power, but I'm going to get into that.
5458340	5464500	Look, you keep looking at me, you're looking at me like you want me to fucking change.
5464500	5465460	Yes, I do.
5466980	5468820	Do not listen to them, America.
5473380	5477700	Keep drinking imported vodka and fucking our beautiful, beautiful prostitutes.
5478500	5480420	We have some of the best prostitutes in the world.
5480420	5481140	They'll pee on you.
5486340	5486980	I'm sorry.
5487620	5488580	I have to go now.
5489700	5490180	All right.
5490820	5492500	I guess I'll just be left alone.
5494020	5499380	I hope that you are NATO.
5502580	5506740	Escalator, escalator, escalator.
5508340	5510180	Welcome to Tromsky Tower.
5511300	5512340	Thank you.
5512340	5516260	We knew you would eventually be here when you got tired of the blacks and the Mexicans.
5516820	5519220	I hate everything that's not white.
5520900	5521620	So do we.
5523780	5525700	You should have seen what we did to the Chinese.
5527700	5529700	Oh, so many Chinese people, angry.
5530740	5531300	Too soon?
5532660	5535860	Anyway, I don't listen to American crying.
5536740	5541460	I just got to a point where I couldn't have anything to be proud of anymore.
5541460	5544420	So it got down to what I was born as.
5545300	5546100	We were watching.
5546100	5547540	You had no direction.
5547540	5554100	You didn't know whether you wanted oil or to save the world or to conserve or to spend.
5554100	5557460	In the end, specialness was all anyone wanted.
5557460	5558980	We all want to be special.
5558980	5561460	No one wants to say, I'm a part of something.
5561540	5565860	That's why even the most elite, liberal, white, chic people,
5565860	5572660	when not given control over their own world, will just retreat into suicidal drama.
5574260	5575940	You are talking about Dan Harmon.
5577940	5579380	Jimmy Corrain.
5579380	5579880	Yes.
5580660	5582020	That's it voted for Trump.
5582900	5583860	Thank you, Oscar.
5583860	5584420	That's it.
5587540	5589140	In the end, I guess I failed,
5589140	5592500	because no small part of me wanted to just be a small part of me.
5593380	5599220	It's ironic, given that the greatest part of me, John F. Kennedy, or my spleen,
5601300	5604260	once said, that's not what your country can do for you,
5604260	5605780	but what you can do for your country.
5606580	5607780	Also ironic that he...
5608980	5609780	Then was shot.
5610820	5612740	I was going to say that he objectified women,
5615140	5617140	but he got away with it because he's better looking.
5619700	5621140	We are splitting hairs.
5621140	5623540	Right, and we have no hairs left to split.
5623540	5624100	That's right.
5625140	5626180	You and me, Pooty.
5627780	5629460	You are going to love the future.
5630420	5634500	All white, beautiful, even Africa would be white.
5635060	5636500	We'll grow oranges there.
5637380	5638260	I can't wait.
5638900	5640340	I love oranges.
5640340	5641860	I love white people.
5641860	5643220	I love white skin.
5644740	5645700	Take me there now.
5646500	5647060	Take me.
5647940	5648740	You're already there.
5650100	5650980	I'm there?
5651540	5652980	Here we are, together.
5653620	5658580	But it just looks like the architect's office in The Matrix Reloaded.
5659780	5660420	It's just a...
5661220	5661780	What do you mean?
5661780	5663620	It's just a room full of TVs.
5664980	5666340	It wasn't going to be fun.
5667780	5669460	You tricked me.
5669460	5670020	Yes.
5670020	5671380	I wanted the earth.
5671380	5675780	Yes, but you were going to bring along rap music and high fat foods.
5675780	5677780	Food popular people made me popular.
5678340	5680580	Oh, we made you popular.
5680580	5680900	No!
5681780	5683140	I got to get out.
5683140	5685300	I want to make America great.
5685300	5687060	Ask your parents for help.
5688820	5689060	No!
5694020	5695060	And scene.
5697860	5698420	We did it.
5700340	5701220	We did it.
5701220	5701700	Wow.
5701700	5702820	We solved the problems.
5704340	5705380	We changed the world.
5708660	5712820	I think we revealed that we read a lot about politics.
5713860	5714420	You do.
5714420	5715700	It's obvious I don't.
5716740	5717780	What time is it?
5717780	5720820	We should do that show at high schools so kids learn.
5724180	5725620	Or getting close to two.
5725620	5725940	Yeah, we're getting there.
5725940	5726740	We can wrap it up.
5729300	5733220	People, they like to come and they like to hear the rapping skills of me.
5738100	5740100	Yeah.
5740100	5741940	You give me a thumbs up on the rapping.
5741940	5743220	Yeah, if you can make music.
5743860	5746020	And then when you guys leave here, you can go watch Rick and Morty.
5746020	5746900	It's like running on a...
5748420	5749300	Maybe you'll like it.
5751620	5752020	All right.
5752020	5752420	We do it.
5752420	5756100	There may be a couple false starts because it's been an intense show.
5756740	5757780	It was an okay one.
5759300	5760340	My energy's lagging.
5762100	5763140	Just let me get in the flow.
5763140	5767060	Whoo!
5767060	5768420	And then I may throw to you guys.
5768420	5768900	No, no.
5772740	5773300	It may take...
5774100	5774340	Yo.
5775300	5776180	Yo.
5776180	5777060	Go with the flow.
5777060	5777700	Yo.
5777700	5778020	Yo.
5778020	5778500	Rap with you.
5778500	5778900	No.
5778900	5779460	Yo.
5779460	5779780	Yo.
5779780	5780660	Go with the flow.
5780660	5781780	In Chicago.
5781780	5783620	C-H-I-C-A-G-O.
5783620	5784420	Go with the flow.
5784420	5785300	That's what you know.
5785860	5788260	A windy city is a city with wind.
5788260	5790660	I fucked your mama until she became thin.
5790660	5792580	She used to be fat and then I got in.
5792580	5794980	I made her lose weight and then her life begins.
5796100	5797940	I want to fuck your mama so hard.
5797940	5800340	I want to fuck your mama in the back and front yard.
5800340	5802260	I want to take a lawnmower on her pussy.
5802260	5804260	Gonna fuck your mama so hard as...
5804260	5804500	Okay.
5804500	5804980	Sorry.
5804980	5806340	It's getting so misogynist.
5808900	5809220	All right.
5810740	5811380	Starting over.
5812340	5813220	All right.
5813220	5813460	Yo.
5814740	5817060	I fucked your daddy until his dick was raw.
5820820	5822260	Grabbed his dick with my southpaw.
5822980	5825460	Jerked it off and put it in my maw.
5826740	5829220	Because your daddy's dick is just an object for me.
5830340	5832260	Your daddy's a piece of shit because he's male.
5832260	5833700	He's a piece of male shit.
5835060	5836020	I'm here to use him.
5836660	5837940	I fucked your daddy.
5837940	5838980	I broke his fuse and...
5840100	5841380	Your daddy's a piece of shit.
5841380	5843700	He's just a dick and balls on a stick.
5845220	5847220	Men are dumb.
5849460	5850980	They can be replaced with your thumb.
5851940	5853860	Stick it in there like gum.
5855940	5857460	Roll it around and have some fun.
5858020	5860260	Your daddy's just a piece of garbage.
5860260	5862660	Nothing is gonna rhyme with garbage ever.
5864740	5865300	Yo.
5865300	5866500	Yo.
5867540	5868500	We had some fun.
5868500	5869620	We had some laughs.
5869620	5870740	I fucked your mama.
5870740	5872100	I fucked a giraffe.
5872100	5874740	It had a long neck so I snapped it in two.
5874740	5877140	I fucked your daddy and made him eat poo.
5877140	5879220	He ate the poo and he said that's good.
5879220	5881780	I took him outside and made him chop wood.
5881780	5883860	He was an indentured servant to me.
5884820	5886260	Then I made him drink my pee.
5887060	5887700	He drank it.
5887700	5888900	He said that's yummy.
5891460	5891940	Yeah.
5894500	5896660	There are seven kinds of urine.
5898820	5899300	Yellow.
5900580	5901380	Off yellow.
5902660	5903220	Orange.
5904340	5905220	Off orange.
5906180	5907780	And three others.
5910020	5910500	Yo.
5912500	5913220	Chicago.
5914100	5916340	It's in the great state of Illinois.
5916340	5917860	I fucked your mama like my name was...
5918500	5918980	Troy.
5919540	5919700	What?
5919700	5920100	Troy.
5920100	5920500	Troy.
5920500	5920980	Like Troy.
5920980	5921380	Troy.
5921380	5921860	Troy.
5921860	5922020	Troy.
5922020	5922580	Troy.
5922580	5923220	Troy.
5923220	5923700	With a T.
5924340	5925540	Like my name was Troy.
5928900	5929300	Okay.
5929300	5929620	All right.
5930660	5932180	It's a very common name in Chicago.
5932180	5932820	Troy.
5932820	5933380	Right.
5933380	5933860	Okay.
5933860	5934100	Yo.
5935220	5938180	The I-95 freeway is a thing.
5939860	5942740	You take the 43 to the 95.
5942740	5945140	I fucked your mama the entire time she was alive.
5945860	5949060	And I left when she was dead because I'm not a ghoul.
5955860	5956500	Impound.
5957300	5957780	Yo.
5958980	5960500	It doesn't matter who you vote for.
5960500	5961940	You're still an American.
5961940	5964420	I fucked your mama so hard she turned into a pelican.
5969620	5970580	Scrapin' the barrel.
5971540	5973380	You gotta scrape that barrel.
5973380	5976420	I gotta scrape that barrel when you rap.
5976980	5978740	I rap, rap, rap, rap.
5978740	5981780	I fucked your mama so hard she grew two feet.
5981780	5984180	I fucked your mama so she turned to meat.
5984180	5985620	I didn't object to fire.
5985620	5986980	I deified her.
5986980	5988580	She was good meat.
5989700	5990260	Holy meat.
5990820	5993300	Looked up at her from the street and said,
5993300	5995220	Pray to Jesus, I love your mama.
5995220	5998100	She said, looked down, she said, camel, llama.
5998100	6001700	I said, Osama bin llama didn't, didn't, didn't.
6001700	6002100	Fuck.
6002100	6002340	Shit.
6002340	6002820	Hold on.
6002820	6005220	Just, I told you you needed to give me a couple chances to start.
6006260	6006740	Yo.
6010020	6010420	Yeah.
6014260	6015140	Home in town.
6015860	6016100	All right.
6016100	6017540	Can we end the show there?
6017540	6018020	Okay.
6018020	6018980	You got this.
6018980	6019220	Yeah.
6020420	6024260	Remember, seven types of pee fucked your mama.
6024260	6024580	Okay.
6025700	6026100	All right.
6026900	6027940	Seven types of pee.
6029460	6030580	We didn't end the show there though.
6031220	6031620	Okay.
6031620	6032100	The next.
6032100	6032580	Okay.
6032580	6033860	They wanted to end the show there.
6035460	6037140	They didn't make enough fucking noise.
6039940	6040260	All right.
