15780	33160	The
33160	59920	Army Town is now in session. Please, please, let's welcome our mayor, Dan Harlan. Thank
59920	66280	you, Andy Dick. Yes, Comptroller Andy Dick. Thank you. But not, you know, not really
66280	74560	because Jeff is here. But he was so late that Jeff was like, start without me. And I was
74560	78800	like, well, Andy do it. And Andy was like, I'll do it. And then Jeff was like, I'm a
78800	87040	block away. And Andy was like, too late. So now Jeff's in the bathroom and we're starting
87040	91120	the show. And, and thank you very much. I think you'd make a great Comptroller. Thank
91120	101360	you. Anytime. Anytime. You know, the job entails like keeping me on topic. For instance, like
101360	106200	I tend to, I tend to go off on tangents. And then sometimes I need to recall what I was
106200	116440	talking about. Oh, get up here. Are you get up here? Oh, he's, he's, I need a little notepad
116440	123260	then if I'm, who's going to keep me on track? Well, maybe just maybe your joy will make
123260	130760	you remember what I'm, what I'm talking about. So for instance, do you know about October
130760	139400	birthdays, Andy? No, I don't. All right. Well, I found out, did I talk about this? Where
139400	145240	if your birthday's in early October, like you're, you have one of the more popular birthdays,
145240	151720	it's not spread out. Like, it's not like one 365th of everyone like has each birthday.
151720	157320	Like there's very popular birthdays and October 5th is the ultimate. It is the most popular
157320	162680	birthday. And the reason why they think that is, is because 274 days earlier is New Year's
162680	170320	Eve. Pretty interesting. Pretty fun. So then you go like, okay, so what is the, uh, that's
170320	174760	already really interesting because New Year's Eve, like it really makes you think like what
174760	182680	we do that night, we, we, we, we lament like who we are and we, and we make all these plans
182680	188320	for like turning over a new leaf. And then we do the shit that fucks up our whole life
188320	192320	that night, that very night. Like we do some of the craziest shit. Like I'm sure there's,
192320	196840	I'm sure the DUI numbers are through the roof that night, right? That's an easy guess. Like
196840	200920	I probably not wrong about that. Probably like a lot of, like a lot of lives get ruined
200920	207920	on New Year's Eve while people are like finally 2017, it's going to be different. Yeah, it
207920	214040	is. You're going to be pregnant or dead. Uh, but, uh, and then, and then you think not
214040	217360	that being pregnant is a bad thing, by the way. I mean, well it is now we have horrible
217360	223000	overpopulation shame on you. Uh, also who's, who's this person going to be? Picasso. We,
223000	228440	we made all the good people were fucked. You're just, you're just making another omen, you
228440	235160	know, in a, in a world with an omen surplus. We got, we got, we got enough Damien's. Um,
235160	242400	oh, but then you start, you say, okay, what's the least popular birthday? Uh, uh, uh, it's
242400	249480	May 22nd and then you go 274 days from back and that, that's August 22nd. So is it just
249480	255680	too hot to fuck? That was Cody's, that was Cody's theory. It's just too hot. You don't,
255680	260480	it's not a holiday. Of course it's the opposite of a holiday. It's just a hot day and the
260480	264800	fans blowing on you and you feel like you're in a shitty, like, like, like urban cowboy
264800	280960	movie. Like you're in a, uh, let's bring out Spencer Crittenden. Oh shit. I'm doing this
280960	289040	wrong. As Jeff texted me, tell Andy to bring Spencer out. Hashtag controlled. But then I
289040	293360	brought him out. I should have told you to bring him out. Do you want to try bringing him out? You
293360	298880	don't have to, you can stay out. I could go back. Just pretend to go back. Just stay there. Yeah.
298880	308880	Okay. How would you have brought him out? Well, the way I'm told. So you, you, you would say,
308960	316720	you would have me say, and now, uh, what was his title? Uh, Game Master. And now
317840	329840	give it up for Game Master Spencer Crittenden. Thank you. Thank you.
331840	336640	So what are you doing over there? I mean, you, you look like you're... I'm fact checking and
336640	342800	are you... Oh wait, you're right. It's about the birthday thing. The birthday is hot. So someone
342800	347520	having a birthday? No, it's about October. You know, all that stuff. It's all true. I mean,
347520	351360	if you were wrong, I would say something, but you were looking it up. Let's just say that.
351360	355920	Were you really looking it up? You weren't looking up. Are you periscoping? I'm trying to get it.
357520	362160	Got me. Yes, I'm trying to get it. Yeah. He's periscoping during our show. I'm trying to.
362160	366800	He's trying to periscope our show. Is that, is that okay? It's like, it's like, it's like
366800	371280	one of the, it's like an airplane flying up next to another airplane and like siphoning gas out of
371280	379520	it. It's like, like one of those refueling planes, but it's not, it's unfuelling. No, but it's more
379520	384480	like you're, you're a fucking juggernaut and I'm just a little drone going, just trying to get a
384480	392080	little of your juice. Well, we disagree on tank size. Yeah. But you're right. No, I'm like a little
392080	397360	mosquito. Yeah. Okay. You're right. I'm a, but I'm not, I was kidding. No, it doesn't, to answer
397360	402480	your question, it's not really. There's no, you can periscope. I asked him earlier. Yeah. Obviously
402480	408720	that's why I knew that what he was doing. Okay. What do we got here? Jeff's, Jeff's texting a gif
409200	418880	of Stephen Colbert going like this. Let me, let me just talk about this for a second,
419440	427360	if I might. So King Ralph, huh? What a movie. All right. Well, I'll talk about that later.
428800	429520	All right. And I,
429520	444240	uh, and I had a, I had a, uh, I had, I tried to watch the conjuring with, uh, with Cody.
447360	450400	You don't have to play. I want them to feel welcome. I mean,
452800	457440	I tried to watch the conjuring with Cody and she had taken a bunch of muscle relaxers and we weren't
457440	461680	really getting a lot of sleep and the dogs were barking a lot at raccoons in the backyard. And,
462320	469680	and, uh, and, uh, what happened was I, I, I like it just like we watched the conjuring and it was,
469680	473360	it was scary. And we were asleep, but we couldn't sleep all night and there was always
473360	479200	shit happening. And, and, and she was like, uh, I'd something and, but, and we're both drunk,
479200	482560	but then in the middle of the night she got up to go to the bathroom and then she,
482560	488880	cause she couldn't see. She, she like, she was just walking around like this,
490880	495120	like holding her hands out, like being careful, which is like how ghosts walk.
496320	500560	And then, and then I woke up and she saw me see her and she went, I'm not a ghost. I'm not a ghost.
502160	506080	Which is a really funny thing to have to say to somebody. And it's even funnier to be right.
506080	509440	That's the thing to say. Like she knew I thought she was a ghost. I'm not a ghost. I'm not a ghost.
509440	514800	I realize I look like a ghost. That's pretty self-aware. And it made me think that's what
514800	518800	that, you know, that's what must be happening to ghosts. Like they're probably dying and, and,
518800	522880	and walking around the land of the living is like being on Vicodin at three in the morning. Like
522880	526720	they're all probably just going like this because they're like, what the fuck is going on? And then
526720	532480	we're like, Oh, that's, that's like a scare gesture. And they're like, no, I'm, I can't see
532560	539200	without my ghost glasses. But, but, and they're saying, I am a ghost. Yeah.
540880	544240	Yeah. They're saying, they're going, they're going, I'm not alive. I'm not alive. Right.
544800	547920	And you're like, that's not scary. But it comes out.
553200	559440	Poor, poor ghosts. Do you know who Amanda Knox is? I just watched it. Yeah. Did you watch the
559440	563520	whole thing? Well, my favorite part was a guy that was like, that when he's the guy said,
563520	566800	when it turned out, like no one had done any DNA testing or whatever. And the guys like,
567360	573840	like, dude, I wish when the Americans started to question our, our process forensically,
573840	579200	made me very upset in the year 1308, this country was the birthplace of the American
579200	583680	or the Western justice system or something like that. In 1308 in America, they were drawing
583920	589440	a buffalo on the walls of caves. That was so adorable.
592800	599760	I love the idea that we were, we were Native Americans or cavemen. He might think that we
599760	605280	were like cavemen. And I also love the idea that he doesn't understand that that's not the,
605280	609920	you don't want to go to the older country for the forensics. He's like, he's like,
609920	614640	are you kidding me? We invented eyeglasses. Of course we know whose blood splatter that was.
615440	620240	No, you need lasers for that. You silly, silly feudal man.
621040	624400	It's weird to think that, that he really thinks that way about us.
624400	627680	I know. And it really goes to show you that he wouldn't have like a built-in shame.
627680	632160	That's, and then you go like, oh wait, what's so great about, like we really adapted that,
632720	637680	that concept that out with the old and with the new to such an extreme that we suffer for it to
637680	642480	this day. We have no, we have no foundational culture, but at the same time, we don't have a
642480	646720	class system that's so entrenched that you just, a lot of people are going, excuse me, we don't,
646720	652480	but, but, but it like in very, very European ways, class is like something totally like,
652480	658320	like still like, I think it's just baked into the system. And over here it's like,
658320	663360	I just, I always look at it like America is the Las Vegas of the planet. So it's like a ton of
663360	669360	bad shit happening all on the sidewalk. Everyone like shaking their head, like no culture, just
669360	675360	blinking me on, just everyone trying to out-gosh everybody because fuck you. I won. You lost. Oh,
675360	680640	I'm up today. I'm down tomorrow. And every, you know, it's like, yeah, yeah. It's like in every
680640	685280	way, every metaphor that would apply. And then everyone else is like, this can't last. And like,
685280	689520	it's about to blow up and just waiting very patiently. And for them, the definition of patience
689520	694480	is 400 years, you'll still be a flash of the pan if you're gone. And I'm like, we're, we're,
694480	698960	we're on that schedule. They're going to be right. These blue bloods, they're going to be like,
698960	705440	remember when the Americans were around? They could be right. Hey, about Amanda Knox,
705440	712880	what did, what did you think of her boyfriend? Uh, I don't remember his Sarah, Sarah,
712880	718880	Saredi or Sarate. Did you guys see the little documentary? I love documentaries. It's about
718880	724640	this. It was in the news. I watched it in the news about this girl named Amanda Knox, who was
724640	731440	accused of killing her roommate while she was doing a study abroad thing, um, in Italy. And
732480	736240	they said she killed her roommate. I guess nobody knows about it. Well, what are you going to ask
736240	742720	her about? Well, it doesn't really matter. Did you guys see it? It's on Netflix. Some of you
742800	750160	did. It's a one time. It's a documentary. I loved it because it's one of those ones. They do so well
750160	760880	with those where you're, I'm like, Oh God, that, that bitch is guilty. They make her seem so crazy
760880	767600	in the beginning. And within the first two minutes, she's making little meatballs with raw meat. Oh,
767600	773040	that's so creepy. And why are they, I got, cause it's so gross. She says, she has the, she has the
773040	777840	first word and she says, look, the thing is I'm different. I act weird. I talk weird. I react to
777840	784080	things weird. And that, that had me in, cause I've always been terrified of my 911 calls going to be
784080	790000	the one where they play and they go, listen to him. Why is he, what do you mean? My girlfriend's
790000	796320	head came off. You say decapitated and I'm going to be like, what the fuck do you say? Write a
796400	803360	script for my 911 call. And then they're going to be testy. And I'm just like, I know. And then
803360	809680	they're going to open up one of many boxes in my house that would make me look like, like whether
809680	816160	I killed someone or not, jail's not a bad place for me to be. Like just not a bad idea. All the
816160	822240	alcohol and all the pills. And yeah, you're, you don't just, I hope nothing bad ever happened.
822240	827360	Oh God, man. Just yeah. Just break into my house. Open, open any third box.
828720	832800	If you really are an enemy of mine and you want to see me go down. What about the first two? What's
832800	839040	in there? Just taxes. That stuff won't, you know, that's fine. You know, I don't, I didn't,
839040	844080	I didn't lose a billion dollars and then write it off for 22 years. But then the next one is like,
844080	851920	is that a sex doll? And how old is it? In both senses of the word.
854800	862800	Here, here are the two weird things to me about that, that movie, Amanda Knox and about her
862800	866960	is that in the beginning when they, they really kind of make her look a little crazy. She's got
866960	873680	wide eyes and she says a very strange phrase, something about look either eye and they set
873680	878400	her up real nice, lit, nice on a stool. I'm like, well, she's not in jail. That's my first thing. Is
878400	886960	she in a jail outfit right now? So I know she did not go to jail, but she did. You have to watch it.
886960	897360	So, and she says either I am a crazy sociopathic psycho killer or I am you. I'm like,
898320	906000	instead of innocent, but that doesn't make sense. What does that mean? Because I am secretly a crazy
906000	911440	psychopathic killer. Right. That doesn't mean you're innocent. I don't know what you meant at
911440	917120	all by that. It's almost like she, that's what I'm like, she's guilty. She's guilty. And then her
917120	923840	boyfriend just turned on her right away. This is all spoiler alert stuff. Well, yeah, because they
923840	927680	use techniques that we're also familiar with here in the States because we have the world's
927680	932560	largest prison population and all of our TV shows are about the process of putting them in prison.
932560	937760	And we were fascinated with it. And so most people in this audience, I think, could, could probably
937760	943680	get through an interrogation. But, but a lot of the stories like the Memphis South Memphis 17 or
943680	947760	whatever the hell they're like, like a lot of that and the make of the making of a murderer thing to
947760	953360	a lot of those stories have people who are either, either they're young or there may be a little,
953360	959520	a little on the, on the lighter side of the, of the intelligence. God, what, how will you say this
959520	966800	diplomatically? What path am I going to take through that minefield? They're dumb. Or they're,
968160	973360	or they just haven't, they've never, ever considered the concept of like, just like,
973360	978320	oh, this is what the cops want. They're like, I feel like I'm not saying we're all super strong
978320	981520	people that could get through an interrogation. I'm just saying we would know when they sat us down
981520	986240	in that chair that we, we have to, if we don't call our lawyer, we're absolutely fucked until
986240	990400	the moment we do. And that every moment until then they're only, they're going to do whatever
990400	996880	they can to make us say that we did something. And this guy is some Italian guy who was like,
996880	1002960	really kind of just adorably hunky and like, and, and, and he, and it just makes you sad that he
1002960	1006880	goes into one side of that black box and he comes out the other, like just going, yeah, she did it
1006880	1014240	and fine. Now can I go to bed? And then, and then there's also like, he said, he turned on her right
1014240	1021200	away when, when, when the cops scared him into thinking that maybe she, that she turned on him.
1021200	1027040	And then because, but he had these weird thoughts about everything because when she got home that,
1027040	1032080	that morning to her apartment where the girl was already dead, she took a shower.
1033040	1036480	And there was, and there was, and there was someone else's shit in the toilet that they,
1036480	1041280	no one ever tested the shit. All right, just watch it. Just watch it. If you're like me, you'll be
1041280	1046400	like the, well, you'll walk away like, no one ever tested the turd. It was like this grody,
1046400	1051200	that was the thing is like, no woman made that turd. And like, I don't want to be sexist. Like,
1051200	1055520	oh, they're so dainty. I'm just saying like, they're fucking like, they have some standards.
1055600	1061760	Like they, it was like a, that was a gross, like fig turd, like that, like landed outside the water.
1061760	1067440	I don't care who you murdered. You'd be like, you'd be like in the bowl. Just, I'm not leaving this.
1067440	1072240	This is not going to be my legacy as the person that killed this person. I want a corpse and a
1072240	1078400	knife and some fingerprints, maybe a little DNA, but not this fucking photo of the shit. Yeah.
1078400	1084880	This fucking gross date from a bad Mediterranean. But the big turn to me, and this is the part I
1084960	1094160	found the most fascinating was at the very end, he, he wanted to get back together with her.
1096240	1102480	He loved her in prison. Yeah. And she had a change of heart. She's like, no, I don't. Yeah. I would
1102480	1108800	think that he would leave her forever and ever. Right. But did you, you know, this was before the
1109280	1115120	Billy Bush was a household name, the household. Like, I mean, he was, he was more of a, more of a
1115120	1122880	guilty pleasure, a shitty hot tub room name before that. But he like, like, like, like Billy Bush,
1122880	1127600	like is in that documentary. Did you notice? Like you can hear his voice and I think, unless I'm
1127600	1130560	totally mistaken, I'm thinking to the other guy, I think it was Billy Bush. You can hear his voice
1130560	1135840	going like she's, cause he's just being fed like world is like, yeah, world is a foxy noxy. And
1135920	1142320	she's like sitting down in the gallery or whatever they call it behind her table. And then he just
1142320	1145440	goes, and he's like, I don't know. It doesn't look that foxy to me. It looks like maybe she
1145440	1148560	had a rough night. Maybe she needs a little more mascara. Maybe they don't provide that in Paris
1148560	1153040	jails or something. Like it was just like, I think it was him. I think it was his voice anyways. All
1153040	1159360	right. Who cares? Like that guy needs to be taken down a peg. That was not him by the way. And I'm
1159360	1164080	the jury's out. Did you just fact check me? I knew, I know for a fact, I remember that guy and
1164080	1169280	they showed him and it wasn't, unless I should, can somebody fact check that? Cause maybe, but I
1169280	1175680	remember the guy, I can picture him and, but, but Billy's weird because I happened to be following
1175680	1185680	him on Snapchat. Billy, Billy Bush. I only follow five people. Do you only follow five people? Like
1185680	1198960	you only follow five star. No, my kids and Billy fucking Bush. It was before this whole Trump thing.
1198960	1204560	It's because I'm fast and weirdly fascinated by him because I've been interviewed by him many
1204560	1210480	times. If I get, if I show up, I think he's at E if I remember, he always advised to do my interview.
1210480	1215600	I'm gonna, I'm doing it. And I'm like, oh, this guy really likes me. It's all sweet. But then I
1215600	1223600	started thinking, or does he? Is he trying to get me? You know what I mean? Corner me like a rat,
1224240	1232160	poke my cage. What is he doing? And so I've been, I've been watching him like privately because his
1232160	1239520	snaps are private supposedly. And I, and I've been trying to like assess to see if he's a real person,
1239520	1243200	if he's being, if, if there's a guy, if there's actually a guy in the media out there that
1243200	1246800	actually likes me, that's all. So I've been watching and watching and watching and watching.
1246800	1250960	Oh, no, you were following him because you thought he might be one of the good ones.
1251840	1258160	And the jury's still out because, you know, but the sad thing is, it's just him. He's the only
1258160	1263680	candidate. That's not sad. You didn't have like Michael Osiello on there. No, no, no, no. There's
1263680	1270160	people that I know kind of like me. This one's the one I'm like, I just don't get it. Is he
1270160	1275920	tricking me and pretending to like me? Well, I think this is a good segue because the cost of
1275920	1281600	celebrity, can you weather it in this rough industry town? What if you were a passionate,
1281600	1289520	haunted house curator? We've, we've had my neighbor on before. You guys know Beth Boots and she was
1289520	1298560	here too, but she's not coming up tonight. So now boo. Boo. Oh, shit. Well, I don't, I didn't mean
1298560	1304640	boo, like please boo for me. But I understand that you didn't understand that. But I also,
1304640	1309440	when did you guys start doing things to make me happy, you fucking millennial shit faces?
1311120	1315280	I thought you came here to watch me fail. Now all of a sudden you're going to boo on command,
1315360	1323760	you little Nazis. But Beth has been up here and most recently she was up here with her kid,
1323760	1329840	Timmer, who is a really a dyed in the wool, card carrying four years and for four years
1329840	1334800	for a 16 year old. That's a lot. That's like, that's like beyond dog years. That's like a long
1334800	1340320	time that he's been doing his haunted house. And so we said, I said, let's keep tabs on him.
1340320	1345680	So, uh, he's, he's, he's here tonight with, uh, with some of his haunted house workers.
1345680	1350080	Let's bring out, uh, Timmer boots and, and company.
1364080	1367680	So Dan, you told me that these were the stranger things kids.
1371280	1374080	Cause I didn't want you to think we were getting Columbines.
1376400	1380560	I wanted you to come to the show. Uh, so Timmer, do you want to introduce your,
1380560	1386560	your terrifying friends? I don't know who they are. Oh, okay. Well, the stranger things kids.
1386560	1394720	All right. Yeah. This, that's all dressed. That's Carson. That's possible.
1395280	1401680	Say hi. All right. Well, I don't think we'll forget those names any time soon.
1403120	1406560	Uh, do they have specialties? Like, does it, is anyone in charge of the,
1406560	1411600	of the pumpkin bucket by the door and then another person's in charge of taping the plastic bags to
1411600	1419600	the, uh, to the CD player? Uh, they all do that job. Okay. They all do that. Your mom sent some
1419600	1423600	photos. Uh, well, first of all, how, how is the, uh, your mom said some photos, but that's a different
1423600	1436240	interview. That's not, that's not the reaction that I mean, I, that was my joke, but when you
1436240	1441280	react like that, you make it bad. Just laugh. You shouldn't, you shouldn't, you shouldn't,
1441280	1446320	it turned into married with children. Uh, for a second. Look, it was a show in the nineties and,
1446320	1453600	uh, it just, the, the, the, the, the canned laughter went from genuine laughter to just
1453600	1457280	people going, woo, every time he said he didn't want to fuck his wife. And it was like, it was
1457280	1467120	messed up. Uh, Timmer, can I, can I call you Tim? Should you have been named Tim? Sorry. Sorry.
1471120	1475760	Yeah, probably. So it'd be easier for people like you to pronounce. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
1475760	1481920	it's all about me and my comfort. Yes. Except this time of year when you're fucking haunted
1481920	1488640	houses. No, I'm kidding. Um, so how is the, how is the, how is it going this year compared to last
1488640	1499200	year's? Much better because we have more actors and we have, it's, it's bigger. Have you, in what
1499200	1503760	ways over the last, over the four years since you started getting into haunted house, because I know,
1503760	1507600	I know one answer is going to be, you start earlier and earlier in the year, right? Because
1507600	1511760	this year you started in May working on this year's haunted house. And what otherwise, is it getting
1511760	1518720	bigger? Like geographically, like, is it taking up more space? Uh, yeah, last year it still took up
1518720	1530720	space, but this year there's more twists and turns. And, uh, your mom said, it's just more of an
1530720	1536240	efficient use of land. That's all. Right. Right. So yeah, I know, I know. So what allowed this
1536240	1544240	breakthrough of landscape management? What, what, how did you figure out how to use it better than
1544240	1552320	last time? It's a real question. Um, I don't know. I just use my brain. So this time around, you're
1552320	1558480	just like, oh man, I'm better. Yeah. All right. I've grown a lot since last year. Well, I give up.
1558480	1563040	That's true. I mean, your whole brain is changing. I mean, four years ago, it's just robots. Now it's
1563040	1575680	getting to be robots. Don't get me started. No one wants you to get started. Uh, so that's the,
1575680	1580880	that's the frustration of this age, isn't it? You're not allowed to get started. And yet you,
1580960	1590640	you've started, um, the, so I'm told by parents, uh, but, but, but, but you, so I, so the pictures
1590640	1596960	that, that, that I got sent, uh, there's a, it looks like a lot of like, like, like I'm watching
1596960	1600640	it under construction, I guess, in these pictures, but it really looks like a, there's a post
1600640	1606880	apocalyptic theme. Hence the gas masks. Is there a reason you chose a post apocalypse theme? Well,
1606880	1608880	have you guys been watching the debates lately?
1616560	1620640	That's been our show. Excellent. Excellent work.
1623360	1632640	Amazing. Uh, but, but as it looks like a lot of like, like it's a lot, a lot of hefty bags,
1632640	1640480	like black plastic bags or from Home Depot and PVC pipe and black electric tape. And that's like,
1640480	1645440	is that like just a framework or is it like, are you walking through a world of black plastic?
1645440	1651360	So yeah, pretty much it's the frame and then those are the walls and then we put props in it. Yeah.
1656880	1661440	That's nice. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can't, what am I going to do with that?
1662640	1675120	I'm too old to laugh, too young to help. Like I don't, uh, so how long, how long, how long
1675120	1679200	is the average consumer's experience when they come to your haunted house? Like from, from gate
1679200	1686800	to gate, from running away in terror to running up and going, I think about three to five minutes,
1686800	1694000	depending on how scared you are. Do you, do, do, do what is a mistake people make who don't
1694000	1700080	want to be scared in a haunted house? Do they go slower or faster? Uh, they probably go slower
1700080	1705680	because. So they get scared more. Yeah. They drag out, they create their own nightmare. Pretty much.
1705680	1710720	It's just like, um, uh, when you're a monkey and you grab the, uh, sugar or the salt cubes in that
1710720	1716480	one, uh, 70s nature film and they, they won't let go of the salt. So they're trapped there forever
1716480	1727360	and they die of thirst. Sure. Or it's like, like, uh, like a, I don't know, like other things in
1727360	1732000	nature where your struggle, quicksand, I think they call it. Yeah. It makes your, do you believe in
1732000	1738240	quicksand? Do you think it's real? Uh, I mean, I've never been asked that question before, but
1738240	1743040	I've seen it in movies. Yeah, me too. Only in movies. I've never seen like a nature documentary
1743040	1747440	where Anthony Hopkins is like the elephant has encountered some quicksand. Well, like a lot of
1747440	1757360	things in life, it's probably real. Yeah. It's not real. It's definitely real. It's real. I got stuck.
1757360	1764400	Yeah. I got stuck. I'm telling you, I fact checked it in my world because I was stuck up to my
1765360	1772480	ball sack in quicksand when I was little quicksand is real. Is it real? It's like trying to listen to
1772480	1778320	my parents. One telling me Santa's real. One's telling me, no, it's not. Santa's real. Quicksand
1778320	1784480	is real. Santa's not real, but quicksand. Think about it. It's a real thing. Is there anything
1784480	1794880	other than fear that you would love to cause with your haunted house? Well, equality. Can you
1794880	1801120	elaborate? Just say that. Like, like, is there any other message writing in there? Like what
1801200	1805360	the post apocalypse theme and you're, you know, it's like, should people, are you hoping like
1805360	1810480	maybe people will walk out going like, man, that scared the shit out of me. And also like,
1810480	1816000	did you notice that chaos is not as much a part of our life as it needs to be?
1819840	1826560	Well, I guess that's why Halloween's once a year so I could show you all the hell you can go through
1826560	1832480	in life and then you can be lucky for the rest of the year. Oh, that's nice. All right. Well,
1832480	1840240	let's have a hand for Timmer and his friends and go to their haunted house. You want people to go,
1840240	1846960	right? Like, yeah. I mean, I got, because I saw on the, I think of the Facebook, like, you know,
1846960	1853760	one of our fans, Jane, who was coordinating some, I don't know, there was, I heard about a bunch of
1853760	1856960	people coming to your haunted house. I don't know if they've done it yet or if they're going to do it.
1856960	1863680	Oh yeah. You have a big fan base. We had about two or three people here. Okay. Yeah. That seems
1863680	1868400	about right. So, so we can, we can, we can invite people without, without worrying of overwhelming
1868400	1874320	you. It's 4302 Ambrose Avenue where, and yeah, they go, the website's better to give. It's
1874320	1886400	ambroshauntedmaze.com. Yeah. Every night from seven. And it says face your fears.
1886400	1891200	Face your fears. All right. All right. You guys go face your fears of the school day tomorrow.
1891760	1904160	Thank you. It's Monday. All right. Well, Andy, the time has come for you to, I think,
1904160	1909440	abandon your, your wings as a guest cop trawler and become a guest.
1909440	1922800	Our next guest has been guest cop trawling, uh, uh, and, uh, to, to, to mixed results and, uh,
1922800	1928080	and, uh, oh, here's our, all right. Jeff just wants to be a guest. I'm going to sit out here.
1929680	1934720	Okay. Let's mix it up because Andy, Andy, you're doing such a good job of comp trawling.
1935600	1939760	Am I, am I being, uh, periscoped right now? That was so cool that you had, uh,
1939760	1941520	spooky one direction on them. That was nice.
1946080	1949600	Do you think that they, that they murdered Zane? Is that why, is that why Zane
1950640	1956640	wasn't out here? You're outside my pop cultural vocabulary. I, uh, I Googled it while I was back
1956640	1964800	there. I typed in, uh, one direction who and it autoc filled in who left. Oh,
1965520	1971840	it was Zane. I heard if you play their hit, uh, email, email my Twitter, uh, backwards,
1971840	1978640	it says Zane is dead, but you have to reverse the file in SoundCloud in order to hear it.
1980800	1984320	Where did Andy go? And now Andy's just, Andy's just evaporated.
1984320	1992000	Well, there he is. Okay. Go pee. All right. Go pee. All right. Well, uh, thanks for,
1992000	2004320	thanks for coming and, uh, Hi, I'm filling in for Andy.
2004320	2012240	Do you know, samatopoulos, uh, the, uh, inmates are running the, uh, the asylum. Oh, really?
2015600	2018960	Do you know, is this your guitar? That's my guitar. Are you going to sing a song for us later?
2019840	2024320	It's a surprise. No, it's not. It's a fucking guitar. Well, I don't, you don't know what I'm
2024320	2030000	going to do with it. I'm going to fuck that guitar. Yeah. Well, it's going to fuck me.
2030000	2035040	I forgot. I forgot to mention something about the haunted house that Beth mentioned,
2035040	2039840	which is that there are so many more twists and turns this year that people are really getting
2039840	2050240	lost. How old, how old were those boys? And why was Andy here with them? Also when they left,
2050240	2057440	Andy left right after they did so much suffering. I mean,
2063600	2067680	now where's Tino? Why do you have a duffel bag full of skeletons?
2069120	2072800	Where, what, what did you do or say to those children back there?
2073600	2078880	I didn't see them. I went pee. Okay. Just now. All right. Well,
2078960	2081280	we can't really verify your story until we check the tape.
2083280	2088480	All right. So I know that this has been talked about a lot, but by everybody, but it's,
2089600	2094480	that's part of why I'm outraged about it. Cause it hasn't changed. Like what, what,
2095200	2102080	why did we make this shift with fortune cookies where they're just advice cookies. They're just,
2102080	2106480	yeah, they just, they're just platitude cookies. And you don't even have to change that much to
2106480	2111840	make a compliments. Like you are a wise person and it's like, Oh great. I'll take it to the bank.
2111840	2116240	I got one, one time, I got one, one time I said, people like you at a party. I'm like,
2116240	2119840	that's not a fortune. That's not a fortune. Okay. So take that one and just change it to
2119840	2125920	people are going to like you at a party. Great fortune. No, no, no. One person might not like
2125920	2130960	you at a party. I mean, even like Gremlins me, like fucking be the creepy guy at the fucking
2130960	2136800	Magua store. You're going to get invited to a party. I don't know if you should go like
2136800	2141680	peep. Somebody might there might not like you. I need to be like, Ooh, there's stakes to my shitty
2141680	2147360	life. I always like fantasize. There'd be a fortune cookie. You open it up and the fortune just said
2148160	2154560	duck. That's a fucking good fortune cookie. But it says that all over the menu. Yeah.
2154560	2172400	Yeah. All right. Well, so have you ever seen King Ralph? What's that one? It's okay. So I was
2172400	2176160	describing it to Cody cause we were talking about Trump and then I was like, I don't know if people
2176160	2179200	think it's like a King Ralph thing. Is that why they like him? She's like, what's King Ralph? I
2179200	2184960	said, you know, there was a movie that John Goodman, uh, is a guy in lives in Vegas or
2184960	2194240	Cleveland or something. And he, uh, he's Vegas or Cleveland, interchangeable cities. The entire,
2194240	2199920	the entire Royal family is wiped out in a freak accident, leaving him as the only heir. So he's
2199920	2204560	King Ralph. And then she's like, wait, that sounds like the greatest movie. And I'm like, yeah, it
2204560	2208480	does. Why haven't I ever watched that? And then we watched it. It was like, Oh my God, it was so
2208480	2214080	boring. How can you make a movie about the entire Royal family getting murdered in the first three
2214080	2219040	minutes and like having John Goodman become the king of England? Isn't that the same premise of
2219040	2225120	designated survivor or whatever? Designated survivor. I don't know what that is. He becomes
2227120	2235360	the designated survivor. Yeah. They put the, uh, like the guy that's like the secretary of
2235360	2239840	agriculture. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's not, I mean, like we don't live in, well, I mean, no,
2239840	2244880	that's fun. Sure. Uh, so as a Dave with Kevin Klein, he's the president's double and then he
2244880	2248400	becomes president. Like these are, these are interesting. And then you go in like, Oh man,
2248400	2253280	if this guy was president and it's like, it's the king of England. I guess the problem is the king
2253280	2257040	doesn't really do anything. And I mean, like, and that's not a controversial statement. It's like
2257040	2262160	specifically designed to not be a active office. And then, so then you're like, what's at stake?
2262160	2266960	But then also it's just weird because I think, I think the only thing that, because the royals
2266960	2271120	are a family, that's the whole point of them. So you, since you have to kill them all in order to
2271120	2277120	have them be king, he's just wandering around the Buckingham palace going, this needs a bowling alley.
2277120	2283120	And like, it's not like there's an old lady going, I never, cause she's dead. There's just a bunch
2283120	2289760	of people going, well, you're king. But, but there's such bowling, but does he use his like, like,
2290400	2296560	meathead, like lower class morality to kind of like shake things up for, for good or what happens?
2297120	2301600	Kind of, but it's like so low stakes. It's like, like he becomes king and then he
2301600	2307280	falls in love with a stripper and like, but she's not a stripper because it's, it's really fucked
2307280	2312320	up. Like, and then it's, it's like, they go straight from, I can't believe this guy's the
2312320	2318400	king of England too. If he does something improper, then the, the stewards or the tutors will be able
2318400	2325120	to sweep in and that it's like, what do you mean if he does something improper? He's a fucking fat
2325120	2332080	guy from Las Vegas. Like what, it's not, then you'll be able to invoke the law of abdication.
2332800	2335680	It doesn't make, you spend the whole time going, what the hell's going on?
2336800	2339280	You're talking about a movie that you don't want any of us to see.
2339280	2345920	Yeah. But I just, I just thought it was amazing that the plot for King Ralph exists in the annals
2345920	2351280	of our bad moviedom. And it's like, it's a good idea. I mean, it would be interesting to watch a
2351280	2357600	guy be king of England, but it's the, it's really boring. Like it's not a bad idea. If you want to
2357600	2364160	see like King Spencer, Spencer's the king of England. Like, like I could, I could fill 90
2364160	2372240	minutes. Designated Spencer. Designated Spencer. People are really getting lost in that haunted
2372240	2379360	house. Okay. I warned you about that. I want to get back to, on the front, you know, they go like
2379360	2383040	click, click, click as you come in with one of those clickers. And there's just, when they check
2383040	2390080	the till at the end, there's two people in play. And we, and, and, and, and we, and they've run a
2390080	2394960	thing that the plastic's all intact. So I think there's two people still in there facing their
2394960	2400800	fears. But do you think you find it weird at the end of the haunted house, there's these snacks
2401760	2409040	that, uh, taste like people. All right. They taste like two people.
2412640	2416480	Oh yeah. I don't, I don't know. They taste like two people. It tastes like two missing people.
2419360	2423520	Well, let's, let's bring out Dino so that you can, so that we can talk to him. Bring out Dino.
2430800	2442400	Right for the fuck. He knows what he likes. Andy, how have you been, man? Where are you going? Every
2442400	2446400	time I look over here, you're milling about. Oh, I thought I was coming up there. You're staying
2446400	2451280	right with her. Oh yeah. Andy was doing good. I was, uh, I was, I was standing over there and I
2451280	2456640	was watching. Would you be happier out here, Andy? No, no, I like this for a little bit, but I, I do
2456640	2466320	like, I feel comfortable with Dino. Oh, okay. Get over here. Jeff loves it right here. No, no, no.
2470320	2476800	I have to say, uh, I was sitting over there watching you and it was like, I was watching my,
2476800	2482240	my kid being like a, uh, you know, in a soccer team for the first time, like you're, oh,
2482240	2485280	yeah, I hit it. And when you got your first laugh, I was so proud of you.
2486720	2491040	What was it? What was his first laugh? Nah, I don't know. His mom took the picture.
2492400	2497040	Uh, all right. Well, so you guys, again, just to re-mention it,
2497040	2500000	you have a feral audio podcast called Skulljuice. Skulljuice, yeah.
2504800	2511440	Front rows, love us. But also, you know, you have a, you have a, you have a band.
2511440	2517600	I have a band called Sorry About Everything. Uh, don't, don't, it's okay. I'm not really
2517600	2522960	apologizing. I'm cocky about it. It's easier than comedy. Look, I'm not getting any laughs.
2524560	2529040	And you know, I want to be like you. So I, I don't know if I told you yet, but I started the end.
2531040	2532400	Called? You're welcome.
2532400	2541680	When, uh, when I got my first Emmy for the Ben Stiller show, uh, Andy and I actually wrote a
2541680	2546800	lot of the sketches together. You notice how he said first Emmy? True. Well, I mean, I don't know.
2546800	2555600	I'm not dead yet. It's my one Emmy, but you have multiple Emmys. No, I only have one. I tell people
2555600	2560320	you have five. Thank you, baby. Let's go with that. Let's go with that. Dino, you call your one Emmy
2560320	2568000	your first Emmy. I love that. That's a good idea. What an optimist. But you know, I'm a pessimist too.
2568000	2576320	I call my, my mom, my first mom, my, yeah, my soon to be deceased mother because you're a pessimist.
2578320	2583920	You want her to be dead. She's listening. No, a pessimist means I don't want her to be dead.
2584960	2589200	I don't know. I don't know what I'm talking about. She's not listening. Your mom's not going to
2589200	2592640	listen. No, my mom will never listen to this. I'll make sure she doesn't even listen to you when
2592640	2599120	you talk at Thanksgiving. Right. He's like this guy. Your mother scares the shit out of me. She's
2599120	2609440	terrified. She wants to fuck you really badly. That's like, that's like a wolf man wanting to
2609440	2619840	fuck you. Who doesn't want to fuck you? Why don't you want me to fuck you? All right. Sorry.
2619840	2627120	You have. I have. I fucked you. Didn't, I fucked you for 10 years by not talking to me. You dreamed
2627120	2632320	about either filleting Dino or Dino filleting you. I don't want to talk about that. It's on your
2632320	2636880	Feral audio podcast. We spoke about it of the three of us. You just want to talk about it on
2636880	2643440	somebody else's. Louis CK dreamed about wanting to fuck Dino or fucking Dino. No, we were spooning
2643440	2647680	in my dream, spooning. And it was just, just like a jerk. I think Louie and I were.
2650240	2655680	Did you guys ever have a dream where you were a lady and you were, and you were getting
2655680	2662880	copulated with a pond by a gentleman? I did. Oh, really? Yeah. I have to. I had a dream that I
2662880	2668400	was in my kitchen sink when I was a kid in your sink as a lady. Yeah. That's the one lady like,
2668400	2674240	I know it was, it was animalistic and passionate. And there was like this very Mario from Mario
2674240	2679760	Brothers looking guy, like just given it to me missionary style. And I was like in the sink.
2679760	2682960	And then the diehard guy came in. You're all eighties. It's like ridiculous.
2683920	2688240	What were you, were you shrunken down to fit inside a sink or was it a big thing? Well,
2688320	2692240	first of all, I was a little, I was a younger kid. So in my mind, like everything was,
2692800	2698480	the sink was bigger, right? You know? And then also, if I'm thinking I'm a lady, I don't know.
2698480	2704320	I was in the sink. It was like, it was like the sink is big enough for a, for a butt, a human butt.
2704320	2708640	So you're like in the, I wasn't like contained in the sink. Like, like, like I was like,
2708640	2712960	like the littles or something, or I'm like sliding down a spoon. And if there's a guy fucking me,
2712960	2716720	if the butt is, if your butt's in the sink, how does somebody fuck you while your butt is down in
2716720	2722800	the recess? I figured it out. You're such a stickler for dreams. I'm a visual sinker, Dino.
2722800	2727280	How big was Mario? He was like, he was like a, he was like a, he was like a,
2727280	2731760	his feet on the ground. No, I mean, that's the thing is he was a, he was a compact man.
2731760	2734880	Yeah. He was probably like, he, he might've, he would've had to have been on like a,
2734880	2740800	the mushroom. Yeah. Oh, the way that he was giving it to me on the height of counter that I was on
2740800	2746800	with. He had to have been on a footstool. Yeah. I just think it's funny. But the dream is just
2746800	2750160	point of view. I mean, I don't have to deal with that stuff. So, and I was like probably,
2750960	2755200	I don't know. Well, I would have to say like, this is after puberty and like, I'm going to say
2755200	2759920	like 13. Maybe I had that dream. Oh wow. Yeah. You probably would look like a nice lady at that age.
2761440	2767120	I remember my friends when I was like 12, somehow it came up and they'd like, Dino,
2767120	2774080	you'd make a good looking girl. And I was like mad, but now I'd kill for that a compliment.
2775840	2780560	Yeah. Yeah. When I was 13, I would love to have heard that your mom wanted to fuck me.
2782480	2790080	No, you wouldn't. I'm sure I mentioned this before in Harmontown. Maybe not. I had a dream one time.
2790080	2794960	I think I told you about this, Dan, where I was going down on a girl in my dream. And then at
2795040	2800800	some point she had a dick, but it was my dick. So now I'm sucking. Of course. I'm sucking my
2800800	2804240	own dick and the whole thing. Like I want to do a good job, but I don't want to come in my own mouth.
2808880	2815040	I mean, you've never had, have you had dreams where you'd suck your own cock? I always do.
2815840	2821520	It's like, it's like flying dreams in that. No. What do you mean? In your dream, you bend
2821520	2826640	in half? Yeah. I'm like just sucking in. It's great. Really? And when you contorted? Yeah. And then
2826640	2832240	I come in my own face and I call myself a cunt. I can't tell if you're doing a bit. I don't know
2832240	2836080	if you're doing a bit. Can we, let's, let's, let's bring the kids back out. I mean, they, they, they,
2836080	2843120	get them out here. I mean, let's bring out spooky one direction. I mean, I, I, this is what you'll
2843120	2849280	get at skull juice, kids. No, I've never, I've never, I mean, I couldn't even dream of doing a
2849280	2854480	situp when that's like 11,000 situps. Yeah, but it's a dream. I couldn't dream of flying either.
2854480	2861760	Well, I can fly. I might fly. You could fly now? I know it's even more of a feat. I'm like,
2861760	2866240	I keep having these dreams where I'll just be running down the sidewalk and then I'll just like,
2866240	2870960	I'll realize, wait, I can fly. And then I'll just like start flying. They say that it's a very,
2870960	2876000	very positive, like emotional or psychological state to be in. The flying dream is like,
2876560	2880960	like the most, you could control that with lucid dreaming. You're liberated. You're just,
2880960	2885760	there's no spiritual gravity. Like, like that's a very healthy space. You always wake up happy.
2885760	2889920	And yeah. Yeah. No, I've been going to sleep pretty happy, but also like sucking your own cock.
2889920	2896800	You wake up happy too. I'm sure it's great. Yeah. Oh man. That's all I got to say.
2898640	2900400	Somebody raised their hand and now I'm terrified.
2906720	2913520	Um, I, I am a double major in literature and film because of Dino. So because of me. Yes.
2913520	2918720	I don't even know what literature is. I never read in my life. That's why he has to be a double.
2919520	2924160	It was literally moral oral was the reason that I got my double major. Oh, you know,
2924160	2926720	I wrote more oral, but I never read it after I wrote it.
2927520	2938960	That is super fine. Um, no, literally I used moral oral to, uh, to, uh, fight. I went to
2938960	2942800	a business school. So you, you couldn't, you couldn't do a double major in anything that
2942800	2949600	wasn't both business and something else. And so I wanted to do a media and, and literature major.
2949600	2953680	And moral oral was the reason that I was the first person who was able to do that.
2953680	2960640	Wow. Well, thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Very nice. Give me that microphone back. No, that's very nice.
2960640	2965760	Do you have more to say? Oh boy. Don't, don't bore him. You're a moral oral fan.
2966480	2972720	You got a lot of pressure now. Um, no, no, no. I'm just, I'm just saying like it. Oh yeah. Yeah.
2972720	2978800	We get it. You love me. Thank you. What's your name? Alex. Alex. Thank you.
2978800	2981680	Alex. That's very nice. That's my starburns name. You know,
2984000	2987600	you have a double made. Thank you. Thank you. But we weren't talking about sucking your own dick.
2990240	2994320	He raised his hand. How else do you think about a double major? We were talking about it with one
2994320	3003840	of your heroes, but unless it's me, give him back, give him back. Have you ever dreamed about sucking
3003840	3010480	your own dick? Have you ever dreamed about sucking my dick? Yes, you have. Yes. All right.
3011200	3017040	See, for me, the real double whammy is having a flying dream about sucking my own dick. Oh my god,
3017040	3021440	that would be amazing. That would be too much. That seems very non aerodynamic. That's the dream
3021440	3026080	you have right before you die. Exactly. You're flying along with Superman and you're like, oh,
3026080	3030320	I'm turned on and you double over to suck your dick and you become a, just a rock. You become Sonic
3030400	3040480	the hedgehog. So are you now periscoping because you always make fun of me and you say you're
3040480	3045360	Facebook live. Yeah. I switched over to Facebook live. Yeah. Why don't you yell at them? Do you
3045360	3049360	know this person or did you just enlist this person to hold your Periscope? He's just a super nice guy.
3049360	3059600	Right, sir. Super nice guy. Periscope yourself. Facebook live. So you just put it back on us. Thank
3059600	3066000	you. Do you think, I mean, would it feel, would it, we always make that joke, like, oh, if we could,
3066000	3070000	if a guy could get, it would be the best bull job in the world. And would you know exactly,
3070000	3075200	it's like masturbating. You know, exactly like someone once described giving someone else a
3075200	3083520	hand job is brushing someone else's teeth. What? You're just holding the fucking phone.
3084240	3090000	Don't want me. Yeah, but you, you bring up the exact, I mean, this is in support of my,
3090000	3095440	my counterpoint, which is that we can touch ourselves with our hands. And, and that's
3095440	3099360	precisely why it's actually a lot more interesting when someone else touches us.
3100000	3106960	It's interesting, but not as good. Well, they don't know how to do it before work, you know,
3106960	3115440	like, but that's kind of what makes them so good at it. I don't know. On a Saturday afternoon,
3115440	3119760	like, where it's just like, Hey, I guess maybe you're into like, Oh, wow. Yeah. This is bad.
3119760	3125280	It's like not me, but bad is clumsy and clumsy is feeling around and figuring it out and figuring
3125280	3130400	it out is fun. And like, like, like, like utility is just like, like, okay, yeah, I know how to sneeze.
3130400	3134800	I don't have that kind of time. I'm on the go. I know. But I know. But well, so I'm just wondering,
3134880	3138240	I mean, like, I don't, you're on the go when I have a lot of drinking to do.
3139120	3143680	When another person is touching me sexually, I'm not sitting there thinking this is great,
3143680	3147360	but I wish they, I wish they'd get out. That's the difference between me and you.
3147360	3152160	So I could, so I could just like take over unless things are going so horribly bad,
3152160	3155520	either emotionally or physically, that it's like, that's when you know, if you're like,
3155520	3161200	Oh my God, I'd rather, rather be alone right now. But, but, but, but usually even,
3161200	3166320	even a person you're not terribly fond of or, or isn't even that great at it. Like,
3166320	3170400	it's still better than, than another night of Minecraft breaks.
3171440	3177920	Louis once told me he, he woke up from, he woke up from like asleep and his hand was asleep and
3177920	3181440	he hadn't been with a girl for a long time. So he just put it on his dick to make it
3181440	3186560	feel like someone different. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the, the, the dirty Sanchez, the stranger,
3186560	3191200	the, yeah, make your hand go. I was sitting with, uh, what's his name? Uh,
3191200	3196800	his dad, CC, CC the villa from poison. Uh, I was at the Viper room and CC the villa from poison.
3196800	3200160	I don't know how this came up, but he's like, he's like, yeah, Jeff, you ever tried the stranger?
3200160	3203120	Oh my God. I mean, this is what I'm saying. Like, what are we doing? What is this?
3203840	3207920	Is this a normal thing? Yeah. No, on six grade playgrounds. Yes. It's a normal thing on six
3207920	3211120	grade playgrounds. It's a stranger. It's like, like, that's what I said, the dirty Sanchez.
3211120	3215440	It's like, this is just, what is this? I didn't know. I didn't know. I don't yell at me.
3215440	3219760	I'm not yelling. I'm just like, do we, are we, what is, what is this? Uh, the, the, no,
3219760	3223360	it's not, it's not a thing that people actually do. I think. Here's some rules again.
3223360	3228240	CC, CC the villa says he did it. It's not, he's lying. He's making a bad joke. He said he got me
3228240	3232160	through more than one lonely night, Jeff. He was trying to make you laugh because he was insecure
3232160	3236720	that he was hanging out with a comic. Like he was trying to be funny. Are you saying that CC is a
3236720	3241520	liar? Yeah. I'm going to bring him on the show. We're going to get to the bottom of this. Great.
3241520	3249520	Well, it's, can he not bring three friends and gas masks? Oh, we got to the bottom of it. And,
3249520	3254320	and, and can there just be less like fucking fucking shit to fucking take care of?
3256720	3259280	This is, this is one of the worst. Are you having a bad day?
3262640	3266720	Mercury's in retro. You seem, you seem a little, you seem a little more edgy than I've seen you.
3266720	3270000	I've been in a bad mood like most of the night. I've had a really good week,
3270000	3273760	like I've been having a really good couple weeks. Is it the text about Andy getting here?
3273760	3276800	Did that put you in a bad mood? No, every, everything. What was that text? Ever since
3277680	3282880	I woke up in a bad mood. What was that text? We'll talk about it. I woke up in a bad mood.
3285440	3288640	We can read those. Do you want to read that conversation? That might be kind of funny.
3290640	3293280	Let's go in order then. Why did you wake up in a bad mood? I don't know. Well,
3293280	3298160	I think just because it's like, it's been an extraordinarily fun weekend. We had a great like
3298160	3303120	Starburn's Halloween party. We hung out like it's just been, it's just been good in general.
3303120	3307360	Just been very happy dreaming of flying and, and having a great time hanging out with Cody and
3307360	3312880	stuff and weekends, especially are like guilt free hangout time. And, and now tomorrow's Monday and
3312880	3316720	I just woke up in a bad mood. So it's like, oh, tomorrow's Monday. I got to do the show tonight.
3316720	3320160	I'm going to, you know, and I'm going to get out of that and I'm going to be tired and I'm still
3320160	3323440	going to have work to do. And I got to get up in the morning and just like, I hate that you live
3323440	3329360	for the weekend. You used to not be like that. Do you look, I know I read doing a lot. Do you
3329360	3336080	look forward to doing this show, this show here? It's fine, but, but it is a, it's a, I, I enjoyed
3336080	3341520	doing the show, but, but, but when, and I, I don't want to have deadlines anymore. And then what do
3341520	3345760	you do on Monday? I don't really know what's up in your life these days. Well, I don't even, that's
3345760	3351440	part of the reason I'm in a bad mood is because it's shit that I can't even, I can't even vent
3351440	3356320	about. You know what I mean? Are you doing a new show right now? It's shit I can't even go into detail
3356320	3361440	about because, because it's either violating an NDA or it's pissing somebody off or all this shit.
3361440	3365840	And I just want out of that situation where I could just be myself and be like, like, like,
3365840	3370960	I can just go good day, bad day, bad day. Here's why. Good day. Here's why. But I can't, that's
3370960	3375760	fucking like just, I'm not bitching about it. And I certainly am. Did you enjoy the, uh,
3375760	3382240	Starburn's Halloween party? Yes. Where Dina's band performed. Yes. Very much. That's part of
3382240	3386560	why I'm so cranky this morning. Cause you had a fun weekend and I had to go back to work.
3386560	3390960	I wish you were literally dressed as Ferris Bueller who had a day off. Yes.
3392880	3400960	Yes. All right. So, and then today this shit starts. All right. Well, so, okay. Here's,
3400960	3409040	I started it. Wait, which thread is it? Is it, is it names? It says, uh, Dustin, Steve, Dan. Dustin,
3409040	3413920	Dustin, Steve, Steve, Steve and Dina. Okay, good. Should Spencer read Spencer parts or you guys
3413920	3418320	want to just take it? I'm not in this as you heard. Because we're trying to fool you.
3419680	3426560	If Andy texts you guys about when the show starts tomorrow, tell him seven. Okay. Fair.
3426560	3431120	That's okay. I'm okay with that. So that so far, so good.
3433440	3437440	Because you, you want me to do that, right? Yes. So then Steve Levy,
3438320	3444160	I'm slightly retarded. This is, this is yesterday at 8 PM. So she takes that Steve Levy texts.
3444160	3449760	Haha. Okay. Then Dan, then Dan, I text, uh, a, uh, cause I'm learning to use stickers,
3449760	3454720	feel the burn and, uh, like it's just a feel the burn sticker.
3455360	3458880	Cause it's the first one I learned to use. And then, uh, and then there, and then someone put
3458880	3463440	a Mario hat sticker over that. And then I put a pumpkin over that. And then someone put a Mario
3463440	3470720	mustache and a nose over that. Anyway, there's a lot of stickers after that. Yeah. And then today
3470720	3477840	I, I wrote with an exclamation mark. Remember seven. Cause this is after I texted Andy and I
3477840	3486960	said, but in the meantime, I texted a Ken bone. Remember seven exclamation point and Steve Levy
3486960	3495280	said, got it. And then today at 3 21 PM Dino said, can I sing a song tonight so I can plug our band
3495280	3500080	show on November 4th? I didn't write November 4th, but I'm adding that. Is your band here?
3500880	3508240	Is your band here? And then, uh, and I texted do yep, because I texted yep, but it auto corrected
3508240	3513760	it to do for some reason. Yep. And then Steve Levy, I think put a sticker over that of a horse
3513760	3517840	with a mohawk playing guitar and it's animated. See, I don't have that. I don't have the right
3517840	3523040	iOS and I said, thanks. And who's drinking at the drawing room now? And I texted a Henry, Henry
3523040	3529840	Winkler as the Fonz giving a thumbs up because I, because I had texted do and then yep. And then
3529840	3536080	I typed yep into the sticker thing and came up with stickers. When you get, when you're saying
3536080	3542400	yep. And so it's a Fonz going like that. So, so far, so far, things are pretty, everything,
3542400	3547200	everyone's getting along pretty friendly. So far, this is act one. Yeah. There's a lot of stuff
3547200	3551440	about my guitar and which one I should bring that we don't have to get into it. Why not? It's okay.
3551440	3557680	Is there going to be a very strange turn? Well, I don't know about strange, but it's about you.
3558640	3565680	It's about you. Is it going to be mean? Should I leave now? No. Don't leave now. But don't,
3566560	3573200	but if you stay, don't, don't interrupt this. So then, so then Dino says,
3573920	3579440	I say Dustin or Steve, is it better to bring an acoustic or can I plug in an electric? And then,
3579440	3585920	and then, and then you, I put a period and then I panicked and added a question mark, which,
3586000	3588080	which makes it look like you're looking at your watch waiting for an answer.
3589600	3594800	I just didn't want you to think I was dumb. Steve, Steve Levy texted acoustic is better. And then
3594800	3600800	you said, okay. Okay. Steve Levy said, if I had to guess, and then Dustin, who's in the conversation
3600800	3607440	the whole time says, acoustic, acoustic. What is this sticker witchery? Why have I fallen off as
3607440	3616080	a millennial? And then I texted a grumpy old man in a ball pit. That's hilarious. And a ball pit.
3616080	3620400	Yeah. Okay. It's a grumpy, it's a grumpy old person. It looks like a lady. Because that's a
3620400	3628560	Dustin. I typed in like, get with it old man into like a sticker. And then, and then, and then I
3628560	3634160	said, that's you. And I wrote, ha ha ha. Exclamation mark. Cause I don't do L O. And then Dustin wrote,
3634160	3637840	this is insane. And then, okay. So now I think we should skip over a lot of this. It becomes a
3637840	3642240	lot of stickers because people are now learning. Oh, Frankenstein's there. Uh, Gina says, look like
3642240	3646480	I need to renew my telephone. And there's like a cheese pizza dancing around it with a wizard cap.
3646480	3652800	And then I put Steve Levy's head. And then Steve Levy says, Dino, Andy just asked me what time the
3652800	3663440	show is. Do I really say seven? I don't like lying. Okay. So act two. Right. So Dustin says,
3663440	3668080	yes. Three exclamation points. He will probably still be 30 late.
3669680	3677680	So Steve says, okay. And I say, because I love my Levy, I say, but why not tell the truth
3678320	3681200	and let him either become a better person or go fuck himself.
3683040	3686400	And then, and then I, and then I, and then I realized I'm using the wrong language and I say,
3686400	3691920	or forget even better person. It's like, he's late. He misses the show. Who cares? You know?
3691920	3698960	Yeah. That's even worse, Andy, I think. So it's a bad habit, not a bad person. Steve Levy says,
3698960	3702640	I'll split the difference and tell him we get to the green room at seven 30. I said,
3702640	3709840	that seems truthy enough. Dino says he wants, Oh, sorry. Go ahead. He wants to be lied to.
3709840	3717680	He told me, which is true. Right. And Dustin says, Dino's his Wrangler. And I said, fine.
3717680	3721680	Leave us out of it. Yeah. And I, and I pictured it with that tone of voice too.
3721680	3728800	Yeah. And then, and then Dustin says, I'll text him. And I said, my Levy, no likey lie.
3731200	3738480	That's my only stake in this. I love my son. Steve Levy says, I already told him we all meet in the
3738480	3742800	green room at seven 30 Dustin says, and everyone on this thread is a bad person besides Levy.
3743600	3750160	And I wrote, I told him seven, but I knew he'd asked you to. And then Dustin
3751200	3757520	sends a gift of, of the Lion King cub, starting out happy, but getting sad, but then looking
3757520	3762400	confused and sad. And then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then a, is that a middle
3762400	3767120	finger to leave you or just a number one? Okay. I don't know. I'm too old. So then Dino says,
3768000	3775600	it's not a lie if, if he likes it, just like it's not abusive. I like it. Jesus, you pussies.
3776800	3780080	And then Steve sends the emoticon, the emoji that's a guy going,
3783200	3787920	yeah, the scaredy close teeth guy. Yeah. That's what I use when people tell me stuff where I'm
3787920	3794080	supposed to give a smiley, but I use it to simulate like my kind of like autistic tendencies. I just
3794080	3798640	like, do you want me to like tell you what I'm fishing, what you're fishing for? So by the way,
3798640	3803280	I'm writing all this while I'm driving, so I'm not really reading everything correctly. So I say,
3803280	3809680	so now Levy lies and he'll, and he'll be late. And Steve Levy says, I didn't lie. And I say,
3809680	3814560	I just go by high maintenance and low maintenance. So one, I don't expect you guys to ever let us
3814560	3819120	complicate such a simple matter for you ever again. And two, Andy can't be on the show anymore.
3819920	3824000	Even the guy in the wheelchair just says, I'm in a wheelchair. He, and has a guy that helps him
3824000	3831680	we don't have to pretend he has legs and shit. I haven't, I haven't even done anything yet.
3834560	3837440	Well, you did a whole life's work of things.
3839360	3845760	So then I say, fine, more songs for me. Exactly. I say, and then Dustin says,
3845760	3849120	understood and agreed. And you also, the only podcaster has never been later canceled the show.
3849120	3853360	He says a bunch of stuff that's nice about me. And then I say, I've never been later canceled.
3854160	3859520	That. And he says also true redacted. And then he says, thank you. And whatever. And all this.
3859520	3862640	And remember, the only thing I did is what time. And then they said,
3863360	3868960	we all meet at seven 30 in the green room. And you've been late for the last 30 years.
3870160	3872880	What time did you get here? Seven 30. And I was late.
3873600	3881120	No one else is here. Seven 30 in the green. We're not done. Oh, there's more.
3882400	3888560	So do you know, tries the last word it and says, I will say this. I will say this. A guy in a
3888560	3897680	wheelchair appreciates a ramp and Andy appreciates being tricked into being on time. Yes. You had my
3897680	3902240	back the whole time. Thank you. Maybe I should have said that from the beginning. And I said,
3902400	3907120	you were saying it the whole time. You didn't fail to make it clear, nor has Andy ever failed
3907120	3911200	to make it clear that Andy needs everyone around him to become either dishonest or insane.
3911200	3914320	It's just not as easy for some of us to cross that threshold.
3914320	3917280	That's Levi's ramp and building it profits me more.
3921120	3923840	And then you say, forget it. We don't need all that stuff right now.
3923840	3926480	I think the only person I like in the story is Andy Dick.
3926880	3932400	Yeah. He's the only victim. It was an argument about accessibility.
3934000	3937120	Thank you. Thanks for having my back the whole time.
3937120	3938720	Yes. Oh, okay. I can't remember.
3939760	3941200	I can't remember. That was years ago.
3941200	3946800	He was here at seven 30. I was here afterward. I just got off a plane and I drove straight to
3946800	3949840	the drawing room because you guys said that you were both there or that you guys are talking about
3949840	3955120	being there. I get there. Dino showed me these texts and I said, it sounds like Dan might be
3955120	3960160	in a kind of a grumpy mood today. I didn't sound like the good mood Dan that you've been in
3960720	3962400	for the last little while. Yeah.
3962400	3963760	So I was right about that. Yep.
3964560	3968800	Yeah. But that was just because you have the Sunday night blues because it's a school night.
3968800	3971600	Yeah. So everything I'm filtering through, like fuck everybody.
3971600	3974400	And it sounds like you really were just mad at me.
3974400	3975120	No, I'm not just mad at you.
3975120	3976000	Well, you were. And I apologize.
3976000	3980480	And I have an apartment conversation. I was yelling at Dino for telling us how to treat you.
3980480	3981440	I know that is weird.
3981520	3984320	I wasn't. I was like, don't don't fuck.
3984320	3986800	I mean, I appreciate it. Don't get me wrong, but it is.
3986800	3989920	And I'd be lying if I said 90 percent of the shit doesn't start on.
3991600	3996240	We're like an old married couple. We're like, really, you're so protective and sweet.
3996240	4000880	I don't think we're a married couple. I think you're like my child and grandmother at the same time.
4002240	4005440	And most of the shit starts on Twitter with strangers because I'm like in the middle of
4005440	4009040	something with fucking strangers because I'll get to the bottom of it.
4009040	4014000	I'll tweet a link to an article and go like, this guy did a good job writing this and being
4014000	4016480	thought and making people happy with trying to give us a different angle.
4016480	4021200	And there's always one person that's just like some guy like tweeted and responded with like,
4021200	4025680	like, oh, yeah, it's a really interesting, except you forgot to mention they're all racist.
4025680	4028320	And I was like, you obviously just so read it again.
4029120	4031760	You never fucking read it. And then he's like, I did read it again.
4031760	4034320	After reading again, I think of being a boo boo boo.
4034320	4038480	And I was just like fucking with I was arguing with that guy all day, like in my head.
4038560	4040400	I was just like, you're a fucking piece of shit.
4040400	4044240	Like, how can you use the word racist the way racists use the word race?
4044240	4046400	Like, you're fucking like being like, what were the boy?
4046400	4050240	It was an article about how the reason why the country is like going into the shitter
4050240	4054720	is because we long ago, like we fucking like we just constructed it this way.
4054720	4059680	There's all these rural people perceive all the people in all of the cities as being like
4059680	4063280	out of our fucking minds with no idea how reality works and vice versa.
4063280	4067440	And it was just this article written from a typical Midwesterner who became a comedy writer
4067440	4073120	who's like, look, I would be one of those people if I hadn't successfully fled to one of the,
4074320	4079200	you know, Hunger Games metropolises where I started dressing funny and understanding
4079200	4081520	that edamame tastes good. I'm putting words in his mouth.
4083200	4087200	It was from that perspective, it was very thoughtful and very like funny and very concise.
4087200	4092240	It was just kind of like breaking down our mythology as a nation and how that is why
4092240	4096000	it comes to this. That is why when we scratch our heads and go like, oh, shit,
4096000	4102160	we got to, you know, this is how a bunch of like, like fucking factory working white people
4102160	4107120	all of a sudden see themselves as underdogs and it's not all of a sudden and this all happens.
4107120	4111280	And it's just like, yeah, but you forgot they're racist. I'm like, that's going to solve everything.
4111280	4116080	That's fucking great. So they were born racist? Is there a fucking vapor in the like, like,
4116080	4120800	that's as dumb as inciting with the split as anything else. It's never going to solve
4120800	4125440	anything. I just like hate that shit. You know, that guy didn't read the fucking article. All
4125440	4129280	he's doing is expressing a fucking need to pay attention. It's like he could. Oh, I'm not going
4129280	4132240	to be a sycophant and just say, oh, that's a great article and I'm not going to read it.
4132240	4136080	That's for sure. I'm going to scan the headline and then I'm going to fucking barf this shit up
4136080	4139680	because I want to be smart today. It's like everyone wants to be smart. Fucking grow up,
4139680	4145520	you dick. I got shit to do. Don't fucking like everybody else just didn't say anything or didn't
4145520	4149520	read it or don't have to fucking do shit. You don't have to fucking respond. You don't have
4149520	4155680	to respond. Stop responding. You don't have to respond. Blinking cursors cost nothing when
4155680	4160480	you're making a web API. That's why they provide it for you. They don't actually think you have
4160480	4167760	anything of value to say and you don't a lot. You don't just say you're happy or sad. Use your
4167760	4178480	I statements. I am sad, glad, happy, scared, jealous. I hope, I fear no one can argue with
4178480	4187120	their feelings. They will love you if you feel it and express it, but then you say shit. 45% of
4187120	4195520	the police and if they ever said it, you don't know anything. You're not a scientist. You're not
4195600	4202400	nova. You're just racist or not racist. You're just a fucking dickhead. Stop knowing shit and
4202400	4207200	just feel something. Just say, I'm scared. Everyone will be like, oh my God, he's scared.
4207840	4211120	You make a good point. Remind me never, never,
4211120	4226720	never. Just remind me never to ask you for any favor ever.
4231840	4236880	Did that trip your bad mood or you already in a bad mood where that triggered you to get into
4236880	4242480	the state? I got shit that I'm not doing that I need to be doing, so I feel like a bad person.
4243840	4249280	So I wake up hating myself. I wake up going, fuck, I fucked up again. I got shit to do.
4249280	4260320	You need more blowjob dreams. Real quick, I just have this ability to not engage in
4261200	4266240	people that might upset me like that. I just don't. Yeah, you're probably like the king of this.
4266240	4276320	I just don't engage. I think is it possible that as a tactic to put things off and not do whatever
4276320	4283920	this secret thing is you're going to be doing tomorrow, do you engage with that? Because you
4283920	4287520	know there's no point in that. No, there's no point in that and cookie collecting and everything
4287520	4292160	else. Yes, yes, yes. There's no point in engaging with that. I got games that are designed to suck
4292160	4300000	my time and that is a thing I use to suck my passion. You're so overworked that Steve Levy is
4300000	4305440	afraid like this is a story from the other day he was afraid to come up to you and just sign a few
4305440	4311920	papers and he's like sorry Dan can you just sign a few things and you were sitting back and playing
4311920	4318400	a video game and he's like do you mind signing a few of these and you said well I'm not going to
4318400	4328800	lean over. Like he put him right there. They had to move him like three inches closer. Oh my god.
4337840	4345440	Much like pundits who read rap lyrics aloud on CNN, you're leaving out my self-awareness.
4346400	4351920	I'm willing to hear that and we talked about it but I had to go for the laugh. I know but it's like
4351920	4357040	but then someone goes like what a gross monster you are. I'm like well yeah but it was funny.
4359120	4363440	I asked him in the car later I'm like that was kind of that was kind of supposed to be a joke
4363440	4371200	right and he's like yeah. I was very serious about refusing to lean forward. I have a political
4371200	4377440	stance about it. The sincere part of it was that I was letting him know because he was saying
4378000	4383600	is this a bad time and I was like well I'm not going to say it's a bad time because I'm playing
4383600	4389920	a video game but I will be just honest and say I don't want to fucking like honestly I'm like
4389920	4396960	being a big fat pig right now. Like and I can't say that I'm fighting inner city crime. So it's
4396960	4404000	not a bad time. I'm not feeding the hungry. I just am so fat and so sad and tired. Like I'm just
4404000	4407760	here's here's what's going to happen and here's what's not going to happen. I wasn't like Scott
4407760	4413120	Rudin like throwing an ashtray and going like stop making me lean forward. From now on no leaning.
4413920	4418640	I'm so glad most of us are sad and tired. Jeff you can learn a few things from this.
4419440	4422240	Mr. Everything's great. It is.
4427440	4432080	You know my secret? All that core work of leaning over and sucking my own dick.
4433680	4437760	Yeah that's that's the price I pay. I'm not going to leave forward. So even in my dreams I never
4437760	4445840	get to suck my own dick. It starts with a simple action and then your dreams get bigger. You're
4445840	4449120	like Dan will you suck your own dick? Well I'm not going to lean over.
4449840	4458720	I don't know what else I could do for me. Yes but the dick is going to have to move the mountain
4458720	4464800	to Muhammad. And like a typical Midwesterner I then take that information and I go and probably
4464800	4469200	if you sucked it too much it'd stop me meeting anything. Like that's like that that's kind of
4469200	4474480	the Wisconsin like why I'm not living in California argument. Yeah wow. Like those guys are going to
4474560	4479600	fly on the ocean. You can't go out to a place where the freeways are four lanes wide where
4479600	4483440	everyone speaks Spanish. You're going to die out there. I'll stay right here and freeze to death.
4484080	4488240	I'm happy. I can't feel my fingers because I'm deliciously happy.
4489520	4496560	Uh you gotta you gotta yeah yeah yeah. Big Shrugger. We got a big Shrugger in the front row.
4497840	4502000	Took my attention a little bit. Probably a skull juice fan. Dan what can we do? Maybe the
4502000	4507120	answer is nothing because you have to cheer me up. If you got this burden I know how that feels
4507120	4511760	like I get panicked if I have to go pick up my dry cleaning in the morning. Like I have a bad
4511760	4517680	night's sleep. I think we have to just sell the studio. We just gotta go go away. No you don't
4517680	4522160	understand all the shit that you're thinking of like like running the studio stuff it's not
4522160	4527440	it's the shit that's up to actually me. Like like it's my old life where I'm like oh I'm supposed to
4527440	4530960	be a Jedi. Here's where I pick up a lightsaber and do that thing I'm supposed to be good at.
4530960	4535360	And it's like it's not like my therapist said she I told her the story of like how I was
4535360	4541120	blocked writing this one thing and she was like so in other words like the old Dan like
4542000	4546640	that guy doesn't work anymore. Like you can't just say I'll take that and I'll be back and
4546640	4552640	I'll I'm gonna write it and and it's like that guy was like dying like season six of community.
4552640	4557840	That's why it's like the the the season wasn't much better than five or three or anything like
4557840	4563200	that and yet I was still like like setting records sleeping on my couch because it was like
4563200	4567360	why is this show so hard it's like it's like that fuel tank was empty of like oh I'm a
4567360	4573200	torture genius and all this stuff like and the guy who's like delegating to people like and
4573200	4578560	collaborating with people during normal working hours and then spending his time at home in bed
4578560	4585760	being happy watching Netflix. Like that guy that guy's fine and doing well and has a bunch of
4585840	4590000	things to do but that guy works it all into a schedule but then the fucking dumb asshole that
4590000	4596880	was like oh bright this one I'm like like you're never fucking idiot. Because every time I either
4596880	4602080	run into you or like hear about what's going on with you you've you've got you have 9,000 projects
4602080	4608000	going on right now I give a lot of stuff and for me any one of those things would be enough to make
4608000	4616960	me have bad sleep. Yeah so I that's I mean I'm a lazy guy because like literally if I have to
4617600	4620960	I have all I have to do is get in a plane tomorrow and go do improvisation somewhere
4620960	4627120	where I don't have to carry any gear or do any rehearsal or know anything and can be half drunk
4627120	4632240	I'm still I still have anxiety dreams about missing the plane. I actually have anxiety
4632240	4636400	when I wake up and I'm like god I have to be at the drawing room at 12. Seriously
4638960	4644880	yeah like I'm like I gotta get there because they miss you you think or what I just need I love
4644880	4649360	I love being there but why do you feel like you have to be because 12 is when they throw all
4649360	4653760	the people that got there at six yeah I mean it's a good it's a sweet it's a sweet spot time
4655920	4660240	by policy because now there's someone I don't know if it's about them although I do feel like they
4660240	4667200	like me they do love you yeah I love you yeah but the old days of the old alcoholics that used to
4667200	4671600	go in there they're kind of like some of them have dropped dead some of them have left town
4671600	4678400	yeah I remember going to the funeral of the first one that dropped dead it was it was heavy because
4678400	4682640	I was like okay you know we talked a lot and I had some funny stories and I thought who you
4682640	4687680	talk about it's this guy you won't even remember he was at the rustic not that old I felt like
4688400	4695040	about my age back then yeah and he would always come in and drink a glass of wine
4695040	4700080	and tell funny stories and and I and I remember having a lot of funny stories about him and I
4700080	4707920	thought I'll go there and tell his family you know and I go to the funeral and everyone's
4707920	4715120	you know crying and you know his body's there and you know and then I hear oh yeah he's he just
4715120	4723120	drank too much and all my stories are from the the rustic in the bar so so I was I felt like I'd
4723120	4730320	have to walk up and say yeah it was his drinking buddy right you know the guy I helped kill him
4732400	4737920	so I so I just kind of like just backed up and walked out of the church and went home
4737920	4743280	I didn't meet anyone but he stopped going to the rustic and now you go to the drawing room
4743920	4750640	yeah not because of him though but how many how many how many people people from the bars funerals
4751280	4757360	have you not even gone to but just known have happened like how many oh well yeah I guess at
4757360	4762640	this point like 10 12 yeah I've only went to the I only went to the first one though but I guess if
4762640	4768720	we hung out at a laundromat we'd have 12 laundromat funerals yeah there's one guy that I've been going
4768720	4776000	to especially people drank the laundry for the detergent we can't be blamed for that I just
4776000	4780960	turned 43 but I think I've been going to the drawing room like a rustic like near when I was
4780960	4784960	on a fake id like that that's how long and there was a guy that I thought was going to be dead in
4784960	4792720	a year or two back then and he's still alive but this guy has a glass eye and one of the bartenders
4792720	4798560	was there one time where he sneezed and his glass eye flew out of his head went bouncing across the
4798560	4803040	bar and landed like in the well and she found it and he was like looking around for it and that
4803040	4811760	was like that was as good as she gave it to him in a cocktail napkin he put it in his mouth like
4811760	4816640	cleaned it off with the saliva stuck it back in his head oh my god and he's still with us to this
4816640	4825840	day he's like he's gonna really wow 90 97 percent of them uh uh do you know uh there's a guitar here

4981200	4987040	have one question for Dan Harmon oh perfect I've been wanting to ask this is an awkward all night
4987920	4997840	no it's not it's it's um I just the only one that feels awkward I think is me because
4997840	5003760	this is such a great party and the atmosphere and he drinks and you're drinking and you're
5003760	5007120	all right everyone's drinking and I got we should talk about that a little bit
5007120	5011920	why it was there's no I don't really need to talk about it because I think about it all day
5011920	5019440	and night but I have a question Dan Harmon maybe I've asked you before but if I did I don't remember
5019440	5030560	the answer um will uh do you think that I will be able to at some point responsibly drink again
5030560	5037040	we talked about this last podcast I don't remember the answer no I didn't ask you I got punished by
5037200	5044720	god I think I have my answer got my answer that's a reminder that I don't remember the words
5046720	5053760	I wouldn't I need the words no I don't need words no but let's talk
5055680	5059120	why don't you listen to Dino's no let's talk about this is more
5059120	5064160	and then he can tell me after the song all right well then I'm going to change it I'm going to
5064160	5075840	sing a song about drinking I'm gonna do it oh I never should have gone brown
5077600	5084800	I think I saw you on the way down turn my smile upside down
5084800	5090640	don't clap it really fucking throws me off
5092880	5095360	I'm glad you said that because I I feel so grumpy and I
5096400	5101200	no one's gonna want to take orders from me what do you want me to do no I I wanted to say don't

5106640	5112080	a musician though but then it's I'm like I don't know what to do with that it spreads through the
5112160	5115680	ironic cancer of everyone going like well if they're clapping I should
5115680	5118720	I want to do the right thing too and then it's like all of a sudden everyone's clapping and
5118720	5122240	then it's yeah and then throw down their chairs and dance I don't want that that's why the worst
5122240	5128640	thing like you go to karaoke and sometimes they have a tambourine no just fucking the tambourine
5128640	5133760	is a harder instrument to play than you think it is it's it's loud and you have to have time
5133760	5136640	and you don't fucking have time so put the goddamn tambourine down
5137360	5143600	all right is there another microphone stand
5144880	5148480	oh this will be really spontaneous oh they don't even know

5155440	5166240	thank you thank you Jeff Davis thank you oh I never should have gone brown
5167600	5170320	you think I saw you on the way down
5173120	5175920	turn my smile upside down
5177440	5183120	what's going on I can't I'm not a musician I know Jeff's doing physical calm
5185760	5188400	I was like the guy in the recording booth that was like the guy that's like

5207120	5214640	right is it on one okay two oh I never should have gone brown let's take it one more time from
5214800	5221040	the top I feel I feel you've pushed a little hard on that one do you know I know I know I'm trying
5221040	5226000	to get that can we kind of get that Hank Williams can I get the four four four hertz mega thingy

5238480	5245600	right oh I never should have gone are you sick of that line yet guess what I never should have gone
5250160	5253360	and I know everyone's thinking Dino's a racist he's talking about black women
5254640	5259840	this is not all right take 11 take 11 coming up take out I love black women I would kill for one
5259840	5267040	all right I just gotta quit saying nigger once in a while all right oh I never should have gone

5278080	5288000	never should have gone brown never should have drunk from that cup turn my frown right side up
5288160	5300480	up do I regret it yep never should have drunk from that cup when I was young didn't need booze
5301600	5308800	wasn't accustomed to watch myself lose back then I had the luxury to choose
5308800	5311200	Oh
5338800	5340800	Oh
5369320	5371320	That is the best version
5383600	5387880	So much you really think that's right, I think it's pretty
5390080	5394040	Certainly that's the funniest a slight little has been in a hundred years
5399640	5402720	That's that was a very good slide whistle solo I
5403840	5405840	Agree
5406160	5408920	Also, we shout it down a spontaneous
5409640	5411920	Yeah clapping thing, but maybe maybe
5412320	5416920	Best maybe it was perfunctory at the beginning, but then it was like when it when it was right and natural
5416920	5421240	That's when it came together. Yeah, and it was a slide whistle. That was the key to that fucking door
5421240	5424240	I know if I can't be thrown off by that motherfucking thing
5424240	5426240	I got
5426280	5431000	Well, we brought it home and we broke all our own rules. Yeah in the fourth quadrant
5431840	5433320	circular story
5433320	5439040	Dan come on. Don't worry. I'll explain it to you later. You still seem grumpy. That wasn't enough to lift your spirits
5439240	5442660	Well, I'm in the phase now where I regret my grumpiness now
5443560	5446920	I'm like I'm steeping in shame and like
5447520	5452880	Kind of running over the evening. I think this is the best time tone ever. I think I
5455240	5456680	But
5456680	5458680	It's throwing me off. We're
5459640	5463520	We're in that third quadrant where you tell people not to clap you're telling yourself
5463520	5467600	You shouldn't have been what you're doing. Yeah, and then there'd be some sort of release at some point, right?
5467600	5472040	You don't become the master of both worlds. Yeah, I just forgot in that text conversation
5472040	5475800	How many people would get thrown into the bus including apparently the differently abled like?
5478960	5482600	You should hear skulljuice we make fun of blind people it's hilarious
5483600	5486720	That's fine. I don't think that there's anything that should be verboten
5486720	5492240	I just like for my own personal tastes of how I'd like to be perceived. I guess your taste should be verboten
5492240	5495120	I my tastes are for but for both
5496280	5500800	Tina do you know so in that song because I know you drink and you drink vodka
5501240	5506440	So it with that song you feel like maybe you should never have gone brown. Yeah, I drink
5506440	5511240	Well the first time I went around I literally Kayla what I have a story about whiskey
5511400	5514360	It was it was scotch the first time I went brown
5514360	5519200	I was at little Dom's and I wasn't joking at all during any of this
5519200	5524200	I I got up to leave and stumbled and fell and everyone said are you all right to get home?
5524200	5526200	And I said no, no, don't worry. I'm not walking
5533320	5538160	And you weren't trying to be I wasn't but I was like WC fields I wish I was writing for that guy
5538840	5540840	So
5541800	5545960	You and Dan Dino are both like straight-up vodka drinkers
5545960	5551680	But sometimes do you know you you will drink brown liquor still when I feel sick. I feel like that's medication for me
5554880	5558480	It was a Glenn Levitt man, but I started drinking
5559640	5566000	Vodka after I became friends with you. That's right. Just a trivia fact. I mean, it's not really it's not like a weird thing
5566000	5569240	It's pretty shouldn't be trivia. It should be you should put it on a fucking billboard
5571520	5575840	And you have a like you kettle one calls you up on your birthday
5575840	5580240	Yeah, they don't send me a really they oh, oh man. They love them
5580240	5586040	Oh wait, and they don't even know I'm alive Andy Andy serious question. I know you've been sober for a good long time now
5586040	5591720	Is it this kind of conversation bum you out or is it? No, I'm just waiting patiently for the and it's never gonna happen
5591800	5596600	No, I'm asking Dan. Oh, do you do I look I mean, I think like, you know says we talked about like
5596640	5601160	Do you know and I the only responsible answer we can take no, I wouldn't try it. I don't think so
5601160	5606560	I think there's a great right now biology to it. I don't know how I feel. Well, I don't feel great
5606560	5612160	I've seen well and I got sick all week and I I used to think I would get sick because I'd be a drinker
5612160	5616960	I was a drinker. Yeah. Well you get sick no matter what. Yeah, so it's called being a human
5616960	5621320	So why can't I you know, especially after two years, you know?
5621840	5624640	Try to drink responsibly alone
5624640	5629920	You've tried it before gets on a hand and because this is a research thing about how it works and stuff
5629920	5636480	And there's just there's some unfortunate people in my heart fucking bleeds for them and and I know and we're having the best time
5636480	5643100	Doing this podcast you are you're not you don't like like I I guess I say you have a great time doing on
5643480	5645480	This is the most fun. I have
5645480	5650000	Ron Funches can't drink because he has an alcohol allergy like he he's barely ever
5650720	5655760	This guy I know named Ron Funches. Don't get jealous of him. I'm gonna talk about him for a second
5659720	5662960	He can't he can't he can't drink because he has an alcohol allergy
5662960	5667280	He found that out in high school taking his first drink. He never got to have fun on booze
5667320	5672200	But but he hasn't what does that mean? He has an allergy. He probably just got super fucking drunk
5672200	5675360	Oh, it doesn't mean that at all. He's just throat closed up and he almost died
5675360	5678520	I didn't know what the fuck was going on and all his friends were going you pussy you pussy
5678640	5683640	Because he didn't know because it wasn't a thing that was understood because it's the Asian. No, he's black
5685640	5688140	If he was Asian, I feel like Andy
5690200	5695880	People in the world that can't drink and it's like the world is a fair genetically. This should be a new drinking game
5696480	5697560	give
5697560	5705360	Excuses why someone shouldn't drink and then every time Andy says it gives another excuse why he should we should all drink. I
5706840	5713480	Don't think any is addicted are allergic to alcohol. I think I think that you're allergic. My throat does not close up
5713880	5717520	You're you're allergic. I think you're allergic to being ignored
5718520	5724320	Your soul closes up your breath everything close. I've seen it like you're you're one of those folks
5724800	5729080	Like like you are you're you asked me you asked me that's my honest appraisal
5729080	5732800	But you've only caught me at the tail end when things are super shitty
5738840	5747040	My thing was gonna be like you one drink you're not allergic to it's the fourth drink that you're allergic to and then you become
5747840	5755120	Like mr. Hyde like that you stop being the Andy that we like and then you start becoming perfect. So I'll drink three
5760120	5765040	Looking towards a solution. That's what I want is what I want is the more constructive. I
5765760	5770960	think I could do I am so proud of you right now because I know that you were doing a bit that you know how funny it
5770960	5775440	Is and I know it's coming from an actual pain of how many wish that you could have a drink and I really do I used
5775440	5778520	To smoke and sometimes I miss smoking and different people different shit
5778520	5783720	And some of those people can do things and I meet people who can smoke one cigarette at a party once a month when they've had
5783720	5789240	three cocktails and you meet other people who can have a hollow leg with drinking and other people who like you meet people who
5789240	5792040	Have high cholesterol no matter how much oat bran they eat. It's just not fucking
5792040	5794240	It's not about getting all fucked up or anything
5794240	5798880	It's like do you know that feeling that you have after one glass of wine or a couple of vodka's or whatever it is?
5798880	5802440	And then there's just more it's a war. I know you miss it
5803320	5807920	I know the same reason I would drink and I love it, but then what's that what's that?
5808120	5811320	But that's why I'm probably just down that much and you're able to have self-awareness
5811320	5815880	And you know you're doing a bit right now called like I'm not doing it. I know you're not lying

6043280	6045560	On their bodies. I'm gonna shame so much
6047480	6049480	Body daddy's I
6050080	6053520	Went to dollar shave club.com slash harm in town. They sent me a box
6054320	6059320	Shaving around I got some treatment some blades and I ran them down my face and didn't get AIDS
6062160	6066160	That's not a selling point you can see how the alternative would be
6069560	6071560	Promises you won't get AIDS
6073160	6076400	100% at least for the first money back
6076400	6078400	I
6082520	6084520	Don't even have to check
6087520	6089520	Yeah, we checked
6090120	6094560	As the fact-checking department. Yeah, they said that's fine
6095440	6098680	They can back that up. You won't get they'll give you your money back
6100480	6102480	If you get AIDS from the
6102480	6104480	You
6105680	6113920	Need let me see if I can do this better cuz I'm sleepier so I can take longer to rhyme words
6115520	6118080	My name is sleepy rapper
6122120	6126760	I'm from the 20s and I am free. I want to shave
6126760	6133080	With me with me that took so long to get there
6136040	6138720	You have you had eight full seconds to think of a better
6156760	6158760	I
6161200	6163200	Want to shave with me
6163200	6165200	Oh
6185120	6187120	Smooth smooth-ass face
6187640	6189920	Smooth face no matter what race
6189920	6192240	With race with race with race with race
6220040	6222040	I'm really good at this
6236000	6243160	Shave club is the thing for me. I got a box last week and I'm shaven as can be got a
6243640	6245640	straight razor or a
6245640	6247360	Gillette
6247360	6249360	Probably not
6251200	6259160	If you put their cream on your cheeks you can walk around for seven weeks without any hair
6259680	6265080	But that's not guaranteed. But if you get AIDS, all your money will be
6265680	6267680	retrieved
6270160	6274320	Go to dollar shave club calm slash. I'm a tiny first month is free
6275640	6277480	I
6277480	6280520	Think it's a pretty bold stance that it's the only
6281360	6285720	Online razor company that guarantees you won't get AIDS from their products. I
6286520	6290000	Mean, oh, I thought they would guaranteed you'd never get AIDS ever
6291720	6293720	Well, they're still working on that, okay
6295440	6302040	Right now they're just guaranteeing that their their products are AIDS free. That's not that good, but okay, maybe I'll buy them I
6302040	6307640	Mean Gillette those other razor companies they test on animals
6308240	6313680	Like that that's where you get the I'm not sure and I think Gillette actually guarantees you get AIDS, right?
6314080	6316080	Gillette says roll the dice
6320640	6324760	That's why they're that's why their slogan is the best a man can get they're like look
6325600	6328000	You're in God's crosshairs when you wake up in the morning
6328840	6331640	Think we're gonna make that better for you or a fucking razor company
6333000	6336320	This is it this is it this is the life you didn't choose
6336320	6341240	Yeah, we make things that cut people and make people bleed in so fucking what do you what do you want from us?
6341240	6348080	You should you should be you should be honored the to know us the the only people in the razor business that aren't making weapons
6349240	6353420	We're not saying Gillette gives you AIDS. We're saying they don't care if you get it or not
6354320	6359040	No, we do care a lot you would just but we can't make you letting it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm
6359680	6361280	Gillette spokesperson
6361280	6367240	Who are you Andy? Do you think Gillette when they test the razors on animals?
6367240	6371200	And do we know that they do that they shake like they'd like shave a whole monkey
6371200	6373200	I
6386760	6390600	Happen to know the answer to this Andy they only have to shave three
6391200	6396700	Eight-inch strips off of a monkey by their balls or what what which part any part?
6397260	6401500	But does the shaver get to pick the shaver guess I'm looking for a job
6405580	6407580	Why not work for Dollar Shave Club
6408380	6410900	Well, they don't have AIDS there. What's the fun?
6411860	6416280	Is is your guys as shave company the one that you reaching for a vodka?
6416860	6420380	Or oh my ass when I hear at the end
6420380	6425480	I think I've heard them say do you know why we are able to provide?
6426180	6431540	razors so cheaply and then the answer is because we own the factory Oh
6432660	6434660	Is that the same company?
6435860	6441140	What a weird brag, you know, that's their thing is that the same way I don't really so oh
6441500	6443780	I think that's a company that I don't want to say
6443780	6452500	So there's competing I guess there are like I mean, you know, it is competing companies because beards are so I have a question
6452500	6455140	That's not on our copy. Ken like it's very
6455700	6462420	Male center of the executive blade and like for like guys get this movie. Is it for ladies to the other other?
6463860	6468080	Yeah, a woman you dollar shave. Oh, yeah, you do have you ever gotten AIDS?

6487740	6491000	Can I say this in a meta in a just be meta for?
6491620	6493220	meta enough right now
6493220	6498580	at the risk of alienating our relationship with a sponsor just to speak outside the box as a person who
6498700	6504300	Like with their their copy is so like it's not it's not very like
6504660	6507780	They don't they don't have a lot of information on there
6507780	6514020	That's like that's like that really brings the fucking nitty-gritty like they really do just say like it's it what you want
6514020	6520380	I'm sure it was like fat like like like me undies is like I was like look here's the deal and explain lays everything out
6520380	6523300	They've thought about this. Why should I order underwear from a box?
6523820	6528720	And it is what the dollar sheen confident. They're confident. We're okay. I hope we're lazy
6529420	6534420	Confident the winner they buy who's the gal out there? What's your name madam out there? Who uses a double shave club razors?
6535100	6537580	Michelle and you order these online

6556180	6559860	So so but you enjoy the there are they good I've never used one
6559860	6565340	I you think after three weeks or more of doing ads for these people that I would be kind of a
6566420	6571340	Member of the dollar shave club. Oh, they haven't sent you anything. They have a sent me. She said it to Dan
6571340	6575100	I have a buy I have a box they sent to me, but what am I gonna do here?
6575460	6581060	Give some to Jeff if I shave I'm gonna look like the worst advertisement for humanity little in a shaming club
6581060	6587020	I just will you come get my I will say this since we started doing these ads Gillette sent me a bag of AIDS and I thought
6589260	6592160	Now that's a good ad for dollar now, we've done our
6593900	6597620	We should just start yeah, let's just start swift boating Gillette
6599460	6604140	And I couldn't that be the last sentence in this fucking podcast
6606020	6612140	The end of the credit we'll get back to your drinking momentarily. It's all gonna be okay. Don't shame me
6612980	6616180	Yeah, he was giving a creative note. He was saying that would have been a good ending. He's trying to help
6617340	6619340	Gillette gave me a bag of AIDS
6623380	6625380	We'll meet you at the lawsuit
6625380	6627380	I
6631060	6635720	Just said just Gillette on the return address it could have been anybody it could have been
6638580	6640660	It could have been people from Dollar Shave Club
6641460	6644700	In the same way that the Republican like, you know
6645380	6648580	Headquarters got firebombed probably by Republicans
6649540	6653860	I'm saying that I'm not saying Dollar Shave Club goes out and sabotages Gillette
6653860	6657900	Yeah by sending you AIDS in the mail I but but the jury's still out
6657900	6662460	How do you feel about the the the very well understood and very impressive like demo?
6663180	6668820	Democratic like response of like like flooding in money and going like here's here's Democratic money to repair your place
6668900	6674180	But like like that also doesn't make it seem like Democrats didn't fire
6674180	6677380	You know what? I mean? Like if that's your doesn't it seem like that's an effort to go
6677380	6682900	I know it's like like like yes, because we're the we're the party that believes the in Jared
6682900	6684260	No, I don't want to say charity
6684260	6688140	But like like like like look your your place got firebombed. Here's some money
6688300	6691620	But that kind of does make it seem doesn't it like
6692420	6694860	I'm not saying the people that are sending money bomb to the
6696620	6702740	I am drunk. I don't understand. Doesn't it make it seem like like like the Democrats bombed it when you when all of the Democrats go
6702740	6705980	And here's some money. It's kind of like like that would be a such a fuck you move
6705980	6710420	There's a set fire to the place and then go. Why don't you get yourself a new fucking place, too?
6710420	6711940	Yeah, okay
